The news anchor Marc Brown, entertainment reporter George Pennacchio, and sports anchor Rob Fukuzaki all sported purple ties to honor BTS. The color purple is significant to BTS as member V stated that purple is the everlasting shade from the rainbow. The ABC reporter shared a picture on Twitter and captioned it, Apparently, its #BTS Day on @ABC7. Both @abc7rob & @abc7marc also showed up wearing purple ties. Coincidence?\". He also hash tagged #BTSARMY and mentioned @BTS_twt on his post.",

Stop being such a brat in front of everyone.\u201d He sounded like he was bing playful but in reality Jin was being serious. However the viewers were happily watching their antics as they sat in their hotel room. It looked innocent enough but In reality Jungkook was a horny and teasing Seokjin under the camera. Hands tracking carefully from the top of his thigh to the inner part.</p><p>\u201cCome on hyung! Please!\u201d His cheeks were flushed slightly as he whined out and Seokjin found himself scrambling to distract the viewers. Meanwhile Jungkook wasn\u2019t giving up \u201cHyung I\u2019m tired! Please end the live! We can do another tomorrow.\u201d A flood of comments poured in they either were along the lines of \u201cdont leave\u201d or \u201csleep well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have been live for only thirty minutes! Go sleep with Jimin or something.\u201d Seokjin laughed at his own words and turned his full attention back to the live. \u201cWell fine then hyung I\u2019m going to bed. Night everyone.\u201d He smiled sleepily and waved at the camera before going out of its line of sight.</p><p>However Jungkook didn\u2019t leave. He sat in front of Jin instead with a devious smirk holding a finger to his lips. Jin gulped slightly and reached for a water bottle to try and make it seem normal. His eyes moved from Jungkook back to the phone screen and began interacting with the audience once more.</p><p>Jungkook smiled to himself and began to pull down the sweatpants he was wearing and let his already hard length spring out. Jin\u2019s eyes shot up from the screen to stare wide eyed at Jungkook who only smiled before sticking his fingers in his mouth and sucking on them.</p><p>Seokjin watched carefully as JungKook removed his fingers from his mouth and wrapped them around his shaft\u2014eyes never leaving Seokjin as he did. He was mesmerized for only a moment before turning back to the phone screen to apologize for spacing out.</p><p>Jungkook only laughed softly and let his head fall back\u2014hand working up and down his shaft and precum leaked out the tip. Seokjin however forced his focus to remain on the screen, no matter how hard he was now. Jungkook\u2019s quiet laboured breaths made his cock twitch and he was tempted to go over and smack the boy.</p><p>The love continued on nonetheless, Jungkook vigorously pumping his shaft and massaging the head. He grabbed his shirt and lifted it up to bite on\u2014 exposing his toned torso in the process making Seokjin gulp. Finally much to Seokjin and Jungkook\u2019s pleasure he came. Long white ribbons spurting out and up all over his stomach and chest.</p><p>To Jin\u2019s credit he didn\u2019t even bat an eye, just continued to crack jokes with the views as Jungkook cleaned himself up. Instead of changing clothes he just stripped them all of and made a show of himself in front of Jin\u2014not a single viewer had a clue to what Jin was ogling at. Thigh a few asked. \u201cJust the show I\u2019m watching.\u201d He mumbled.</p><p>\u201cAh wait it turned off I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d Good enough excuses he figured before leaving the camera face down on the table. \u201cJungkook what the hell are you doing?\u201d He had his lips pressed directly to Jungkook\u2019s ear. \u201cJust having some fun hyung, and you\u2019re gonna too. Go back to your live and We can have some fun.\u201d His fingers brushed the obvious tent in Jin\u2019s pants and without a question he slipped them down.</p><p>Because he was sitting at a table no one could see from his mid stomach down, meaning even if he was completely exposed no one should have a single clue. \u201cAlright sorry I\u2019m back, did you miss me?\u201d He wiggled his eyebrows and more comments flooded into the chat.</p><p>Jungkook however wasted no time at all. He was quick and quiet and under the table within 10 seconds, eyes glued to the erect cock in front of him. He let saliva pool on his tongue before without warning licking a broad stripe up the underside of Jin\u2019s cock. A yelp sounded from above and Jungkook not back a laugh. \u201cSorry guys I hit my knee.\u201d He leaned down and instead of rubbing his \u201cknee\u201d he grabbed a fist full of Jungkook\u2019s hair and forced him to take about half his cock in his mouth.</p><p>Jungkook didn\u2019t mind at all, he swallowed around him and pulled back with a quiet pop. Jin knee he had to remain still or else he and Jungkook would be completely exposed in front of millions, honestly it could ruin them. But right now his focus was on Jungkook\u2019s mouth around his cock and the sinful things he was doing.</p><p>Jungkook let his mouth suck on the tip, his tongue running over Jin\u2019s slit\u2014collecting the precum that dribbled out. His hand wrapped around the base and pumped slightly as he sucked and bobbed his head. He forced himself to not laugh at the idea of Jin\u2019s face above him. How hard his hyung was probably trying to keep a straight face and interact with fans. Impressively he hasn\u2019t even tried to end the live yet.</p><p>He was losing his mind though, not having any reaction to how he moved. No moans telling him he was doing it right\u2014no hands tight in his hair moving him as he went. But the fact that his hyung could keep himself so under control was utterly impressive. He decided to test his luck with a particularly hard sick around the head.</p><p>Much to his delight Jin choked on his words above. He struggled to cover himself up and Jungkook heard him reach for a bottle of water he had with him. Any minute now Jin would end the live and Jungkook knew it. The way his shaft was twitching slightly in his mouth as he moved\u2014he was close and like hell he would be able to control himself when he came.</p><p>No one could keep a straight face when the came, it was nearly impossible. The amount of pleasure that would flood your veins was a enough to make anyone\u2019s jaw go slack and eyes flutter shut. As still as he had been so far there was no way he was going to pull it off. Jungkook sucked harder still\u2014not interested in teasing Jin any longer.</p><p>His tongue swirled around the head and sucked knowing it was one of the most sensitive places. He relaxed his jaw and moved his head down fully\u2014not wanting to stop until his nose hits the soft flesh of Jin\u2019s pelvis. Once he did he hummed softly, sending vibrations all along Jin\u2019s length.</p><p>Jin\u2019s leg smacked up against the bottom of the table and he let out a strangled Yelp. Jungkook still found this situation hysterical\u2014despite Jin\u2019s length being completely down his throat. He bobbed his head back and forth and Jin attempted to cover his own moans by rubbing his now soon to be bruised knee.</p><p>He pumped his length faster and moved his head back to focus only on the tip\u2014tongue digging into the slit making Jin yelp. Jungkook could only imagine the amount of viewers above would speculate on why Jin was acting weird with no clue how correct the actually were.</p><p>Jungkook reaches forward to let his fingers dance across the bare soft skin of Jin\u2019s pelvis and felt it tense under his touch, he was about to fall over the edge. \u201cI\u2019m really tired you guys. Maybe I\u2019ll do another live tomorrow just a little earlier to make up for cutting this one short.\u201d Jungkook sucked lightly on his tip and Jin immediately ended the live after saying goodbye.</p><p>Double checked then just shut down his phone completely before pushing the table back enough to see Jungkook with his lips wrapped so nicely around the tip of his cock. \u201cYou really thought I wasn\u2019t going to end that live just so I could see you swallow up all my cum?\u201d His hand traveled through jungkook\u2019s hair\u2014the touch Jungkook was waiting for\u2014 and leaned back with half lidded eyes.</p><p>\u201cJust another minute Jungkook, you have me so, so close.\u201d Seokjin smiled lazily and let his hands run through Jungkook\u2019s dark locks. Jungkook only moved quicker\u2014a surprisingly skilled tongue working its way around the tip. Jin was surprisingly vocal now that the cameras were off. Constant praise leaving his lips followed by whiny gasps.</p><p>\u201cFuck fuck fuck fuck.\u201d He chanted as if it was the only word he knew followed by a low whine of Jungkook\u2019s name as he came in white strings. Jungkook leaned back and let his mouth fall open\u2014collecting Jin\u2019s release on his tongue and cheeks. \u201cSuch a good boy Kookie. I was going to punish you for being such a brat\u2014especially since you decided to do it on a Live. But you just did so good I can\u2019t bring myself too.\u201d</p><p>Jungkook lifted a finger to his cheek to collect the rest of Jin\u2019s release before popping it in his mouth. \u201cWell hyung I still got an issue of my own.\u201d Jin smirked \u201cget up in the bed Kookie hyung will take care of you.\u201d</p>",

Stop being such a brat in front of everyone.\u201d He sounded like he was bing playful but in reality Jin was being serious. However the viewers were happily watching their antics as they sat in their hotel room. It looked innocent enough but In reality Jungkook was a horny and teasing Seokjin under the camera. Hands tracking carefully from the top of his thigh to the inner part.</p><p>\u201cCome on hyung! Please!\u201d His cheeks were flushed slightly as he whined out and Seokjin found himself scrambling to distract the viewers. Meanwhile Jungkook wasn\u2019t giving up \u201cHyung I\u2019m tired! Please end the live! We can do another tomorrow.\u201d A flood of comments poured in they either were along the lines of \u201cdont leave\u201d or \u201csleep well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have been live for only thirty minutes! Go sleep with Jimin or something.\u201d Seokjin laughed at his own words and turned his full attention back to the live. \u201cWell fine then hyung I\u2019m going to bed. Night everyone.\u201d He smiled sleepily and waved at the camera before going out of its line of sight.</p><p>However Jungkook didn\u2019t leave. He sat in front of Jin instead with a devious smirk holding a finger to his lips. Jin gulped slightly and reached for a water bottle to try and make it seem normal. His eyes moved from Jungkook back to the phone screen and began interacting with the audience once more.</p><p>Jungkook smiled to himself and began to pull down the sweatpants he was wearing and let his already hard length spring out. Jin\u2019s eyes shot up from the screen to stare wide eyed at Jungkook who only smiled before sticking his fingers in his mouth and sucking on them.</p><p>Seokjin watched carefully as JungKook removed his fingers from his mouth and wrapped them around his shaft\u2014eyes never leaving Seokjin as he did. He was mesmerized for only a moment before turning back to the phone screen to apologize for spacing out.</p><p>Jungkook only laughed softly and let his head fall back\u2014hand working up and down his shaft and precum leaked out the tip. Seokjin however forced his focus to remain on the screen, no matter how hard he was now. Jungkook\u2019s quiet laboured breaths made his cock twitch and he was tempted to go over and smack the boy.</p><p>The love continued on nonetheless, Jungkook vigorously pumping his shaft and massaging the head. He grabbed his shirt and lifted it up to bite on\u2014 exposing his toned torso in the process making Seokjin gulp. Finally much to Seokjin and Jungkook\u2019s pleasure he came. Long white ribbons spurting out and up all over his stomach and chest.</p><p>To Jin\u2019s credit he didn\u2019t even bat an eye, just continued to crack jokes with the views as Jungkook cleaned himself up. Instead of changing clothes he just stripped them all of and made a show of himself in front of Jin\u2014not a single viewer had a clue to what Jin was ogling at. Thigh a few asked. \u201cJust the show I\u2019m watching.\u201d He mumbled.</p><p>\u201cAh wait it turned off I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d Good enough excuses he figured before leaving the camera face down on the table. \u201cJungkook what the hell are you doing?\u201d He had his lips pressed directly to Jungkook\u2019s ear. \u201cJust having some fun hyung, and you\u2019re gonna too. Go back to your live and We can have some fun.\u201d His fingers brushed the obvious tent in Jin\u2019s pants and without a question he slipped them down.</p><p>Because he was sitting at a table no one could see from his mid stomach down, meaning even if he was completely exposed no one should have a single clue. \u201cAlright sorry I\u2019m back, did you miss me?\u201d He wiggled his eyebrows and more comments flooded into the chat.</p><p>Jungkook however wasted no time at all. He was quick and quiet and under the table within 10 seconds, eyes glued to the erect cock in front of him. He let saliva pool on his tongue before without warning licking a broad stripe up the underside of Jin\u2019s cock. A yelp sounded from above and Jungkook not back a laugh. \u201cSorry guys I hit my knee.\u201d He leaned down and instead of rubbing his \u201cknee\u201d he grabbed a fist full of Jungkook\u2019s hair and forced him to take about half his cock in his mouth.</p><p>Jungkook didn\u2019t mind at all, he swallowed around him and pulled back with a quiet pop. Jin knee he had to remain still or else he and Jungkook would be completely exposed in front of millions, honestly it could ruin them. But right now his focus was on Jungkook\u2019s mouth around his cock and the sinful things he was doing.</p><p>Jungkook let his mouth suck on the tip, his tongue running over Jin\u2019s slit\u2014collecting the precum that dribbled out. His hand wrapped around the base and pumped slightly as he sucked and bobbed his head. He forced himself to not laugh at the idea of Jin\u2019s face above him. How hard his hyung was probably trying to keep a straight face and interact with fans. Impressively he hasn\u2019t even tried to end the live yet.</p><p>He was losing his mind though, not having any reaction to how he moved. No moans telling him he was doing it right\u2014no hands tight in his hair moving him as he went. But the fact that his hyung could keep himself so under control was utterly impressive. He decided to test his luck with a particularly hard sick around the head.</p><p>Much to his delight Jin choked on his words above. He struggled to cover himself up and Jungkook heard him reach for a bottle of water he had with him. Any minute now Jin would end the live and Jungkook knew it. The way his shaft was twitching slightly in his mouth as he moved\u2014he was close and like hell he would be able to control himself when he came.</p><p>No one could keep a straight face when the came, it was nearly impossible. The amount of pleasure that would flood your veins was a enough to make anyone\u2019s jaw go slack and eyes flutter shut. As still as he had been so far there was no way he was going to pull it off. Jungkook sucked harder still\u2014not interested in teasing Jin any longer.</p><p>His tongue swirled around the head and sucked knowing it was one of the most sensitive places. He relaxed his jaw and moved his head down fully\u2014not wanting to stop until his nose hits the soft flesh of Jin\u2019s pelvis. Once he did he hummed softly, sending vibrations all along Jin\u2019s length.</p><p>Jin\u2019s leg smacked up against the bottom of the table and he let out a strangled Yelp. Jungkook still found this situation hysterical\u2014despite Jin\u2019s length being completely down his throat. He bobbed his head back and forth and Jin attempted to cover his own moans by rubbing his now soon to be bruised knee.</p><p>He pumped his length faster and moved his head back to focus only on the tip\u2014tongue digging into the slit making Jin yelp. Jungkook could only imagine the amount of viewers above would speculate on why Jin was acting weird with no clue how correct the actually were.</p><p>Jungkook reaches forward to let his fingers dance across the bare soft skin of Jin\u2019s pelvis and felt it tense under his touch, he was about to fall over the edge. \u201cI\u2019m really tired you guys. Maybe I\u2019ll do another live tomorrow just a little earlier to make up for cutting this one short.\u201d Jungkook sucked lightly on his tip and Jin immediately ended the live after saying goodbye.</p><p>Double checked then just shut down his phone completely before pushing the table back enough to see Jungkook with his lips wrapped so nicely around the tip of his cock. \u201cYou really thought I wasn\u2019t going to end that live just so I could see you swallow up all my cum?\u201d His hand traveled through jungkook\u2019s hair\u2014the touch Jungkook was waiting for\u2014 and leaned back with half lidded eyes.</p><p>\u201cJust another minute Jungkook, you have me so, so close.\u201d Seokjin smiled lazily and let his hands run through Jungkook\u2019s dark locks. Jungkook only moved quicker\u2014a surprisingly skilled tongue working its way around the tip. Jin was surprisingly vocal now that the cameras were off. Constant praise leaving his lips followed by whiny gasps.</p><p>\u201cFuck fuck fuck fuck.\u201d He chanted as if it was the only word he knew followed by a low whine of Jungkook\u2019s name as he came in white strings. Jungkook leaned back and let his mouth fall open\u2014collecting Jin\u2019s release on his tongue and cheeks. \u201cSuch a good boy Kookie. I was going to punish you for being such a brat\u2014especially since you decided to do it on a Live. But you just did so good I can\u2019t bring myself too.\u201d</p><p>Jungkook lifted a finger to his cheek to collect the rest of Jin\u2019s release before popping it in his mouth. \u201cWell hyung I still got an issue of my own.\u201d Jin smirked \u201cget up in the bed Kookie hyung will take care of you.\u201d</p></p>",

In that kingdom, the royal family had the freedom of marrying whoever his or her royal highness deems worthy. Now, of course, having that special privilege came with some interesting challenges, but that doesn\u2019t stop a certain head-strong princess from doing whatever her heart\u2019s desire, especially when she has her heart set on marrying her personal bodyguard. Unfortunately, her beliefs might face some hardships when a certain king sets his eye on her. Will her bodyguard continue to fight for her or is it finally her turn?</small></p><p><small>\u203b <b>Previously: </b><a href=\"http://jinniesbby.tumblr.com/post/175791445214/fight-for-me-ch1\">ch.1</a>\u00a0| <a href=\"http://jinniesbby.tumblr.com/post/175887448405/fight-for-me-ch2\">ch.2</a> | <a href=\"http://jinniesbby.tumblr.com/post/175993838175/fight-for-me-ch3\">ch.3</a> | <a href=\"http://jinniesbby.tumblr.com/post/176061680692/fight-for-me-ch4\">ch.4</a> | <a href=\"http://jinniesbby.tumblr.com/post/176129746496/fight-for-me-ch5\">ch.5</a><br/></small></p><p><small>\u203b <b>Next Time:</b> <a href=\"http://jinniesbby.tumblr.com/post/176307635761/fight-for-me-final-chapter\">final chapter</a></small></p><hr><h2><i>Chapter 6: This is War</i></h2><!-- more --><p><i>Previously</i></p><p><i> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIt\noccurred to me that we need to explain to your nurse about your sheets.\u201d\nSeokjin mumbled as he draped his arm over Sumin\u2019s bare waist. </i></p><p><i>Sumin gave him look, though he couldn\u2019t see\nit. </i></p><p><i> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhat\ndo you \u2018we need to explain\u2019?

My everything.\u201d He\nwhispered sweetly before drifting off towards dreamland, where his mind could\nfinally rest and think about nothing else, but a married life with Sumin. </i></p><p><i>Except\u2026 there was something wrong with that\nplan\u2026</i></p><p><i>Who said that it would be his married life\nwith Sumin? </i></p><p>Waves\ncrashed against the cliffs. Seagulls flew high in the air as the breeze\nassisted them along the way. Nothing but the sounds of nature entered the\ncastle grounds.</p><p>Why was\nthis once beloved kingdom so quiet? What happened to the lively chatter that\nwent on between every villager? </p><p>Pending\nwar. That\u2019s what happened. </p><p>The\nonce neutral king now became ready for battle as the lives of his people were\non the line. The kind mask he wore on his face now was a face of anger and\nstress. </p><p>Princess\nSumin worried for him as did his wife. Their enemies must\u2019ve known about his\ndepleting health, and that was why there were attacking. </p><p>After a\nyear of silence and being left alone, what triggered them? What angered these\nprideful kings to the point of rejecting every offer for peace?</p><p>Unfortunately,\nthe answers that formulated in the royal family\u2019s minds were all wrong. It\nwasn\u2019t a matter of what, but who. </p><p>To be\nmore precise, it was all because of King Ji Yong\u2014and Sumin and her family had\nno idea.</p><p>Except\u2026</p><p>Maybe\nfor Kim Seokjin.</p><p>Something\nabout that deceitful king never sat right with him\u2014especially since Ji Yong had\nhis eyes on Princess Sumin. <i>His </i>princess.\n</p><p>Sumin.</p><p>Everyone\u2019s\nprized jewel. </p><p>Too bad\nfor Ji Yong that she fell in love with Seokjin. Now, they were engaged to be\nmarried. Sumin proudly wore his ring around her neck on a rose gold chain as\nthey both agreed that they should keep it hidden until after the war. </p><p>Something\nabout this war screamed planned\u2014intentional. </p><p>After\nnews about Sumin\u2019s betrothal to her knight spread to the other kingdoms, an\nextreme amount of tension filled the air. Even a tiny glare could easily start\na bloody war. </p><p>Right\nnow, Seokjin stood by Sumin\u2019s father side and continued to discuss plans for\nthe upcoming battle. </p><p>While\nwith Sumin, she continued to receive letters from Ji Yong, and there were\nalways accompanied with a single red rose. </p><p>Her\neyes scanned the parchment tainted with ink as rolled her eyes for the nth time\nthat afternoon. She felt the urge to vomit as Ji Yong\u2019s \u201cfriendly\u201d words always\nseemed to cross unspeakable boundaries. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cNurse!\u201d She cried out, crumpling up\nthe paper. </p><p>Seconds\nlater, her nurse arrived a bit out of breath. The elderly woman bowed her head\nin respect, much to Sumin\u2019s dismay. She had always told the poor woman that\nthere was no need for formalities since she was like her second mother. While\nher mother ran the kingdom alongside her father, the nurse cared and loved for\nSumin as if she was her own. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYes, princess?\u201d The nurse answered,\nignoring Sumin\u2019s pointless protests. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cFirst, can you please stop bowing\nyour head to me. It is quite odd. Second, please burn this note,\u201d She handed\nover the note to the nurse, \u201cIt is from Ji Yong yet again.\u201d She said, rubbing\nthe sides of her forehead. </p><p>The\nnurse felt nothing but pity towards her princess. Ever since that awful king\nreturned to his kingdom, he had yet to cease with his advances. In fact, they\nbecame frequent once the news of Sumin\u2019s engagement reached him. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cDoes Seokjin know about these\nletters?\u201d asked the Nurse as she folded up the letter and tucked it away in the\npocket of her skirt. </p><p>Sumin\u2019s\nbreath hitched. Her heart stopped for a split second. A nervous expression\nappeared on her face as she tried to figure out how to politely tell her dear\nfriend the truth. </p><p>However,\nthe nurse took her lack of speech as a no. Then, she gave the young princess a\nlook.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhy have you not told your knight\nabout these letters? I am almost certain that if he did indeed know about these\nappalling words from King Ji Yong, Seokjin would put in an immediate stop to\nthem.\u201d The nurse said, reasoning with the secretly scared princess. </p><p>Sumin\nsighed deeply, \u201cBecause, I have heard talks of him acting as a general for our\narmy. Fighting in my father\u2019s place,\u201d She paused; a look of utter concern\nglazed over her eyes, \u201cI do not want to trouble him with such tiny problems.\u201d\nShe finished.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOh, hush child. He is to be your\nfuture-husband. It is his job to know and take care of your problems as it is\nyour job to take care of his as well.\u201d The nurse retorted, waving off her\nexcuses. </p><p>Sumin\ngawked. Throughout her years of living, never once has she heard her dear nurse\nuse such a tone. Sumin honestly thought that her nurse was capable of such a\nthing. Most of the time, the nurse\u2019s tone was always lighthearted and quite\nplayful. Sometimes, she would use a stern tone, but only to discipline the\nprincess when she was a child. Now? This was an entirely different tone\u2014and\nthat impressed Sumin just a tiny bit.</p><p> As Sumin opened her mouth to give compliments\nto her second mother, a light knock echoed throughout her chambers.</p><p>A look\nof confusion washed over face as both Sumin and the nursed eyed each other,\nwondering what or who could that be. </p><p>Sumin\nknew that it could not have been her knight since he had sent a message telling\nher that he would be with her father all day. </p><p>Not\nwasting another moment, Sumin instructed the nurse to answer the door and\nwaited patiently for the so-called intruder to enter her line of sight. </p><p>Suddenly,\na short gasp escaped her lips followed by a squeal of delight. She bundled up\nher skirt and ran full-force into the person\u2019s arms. </p><p>A\nbright smile painted her lips as she breathed in the person\u2019s musky scent. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou know\u2026if I had known that this\nwould be the sort of welcome I would be privileged to, then I would have left\nyour father\u2019s side a long time ago.\u201d Teased a familiar voice. </p><p>Sumin\nglanced up; love and happiness sparkled in her eyes. She had longed for his\npresence ever since there had been hints of war that lingered in the air. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOh, hush. You know you missed me as\nmuch as I had missed you, Seokjin.\u201d Sumin teased back, smirking playfully. </p><p>Seokjin\nnodded as he could not argue with his smart princess. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI believe that I had missed a tad bit\nmore than you, but I will allow you to believe that we have longed for each\nother equally.\u201d He said jokingly. </p><p>Sumin\nreleased him from her hold and took a step back. A tiny pout replaced the bright\nsmile that graced her lips. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou are unbelievable Sir Seokjin,\u201d\nShe crossed her arms over her chest, \u201cI believe I have tolerated your presence\nlong enough. Now, leave my sight.\u201d She demanded coldly, fighting the urge to\nsmile. </p><p>Seokjin\nraised his brow, deciding if he wanted to call her bluff or do as he was told.\nAfter quickly debating, he chose the latter. He always loved to hear Sumin beg\nfor him. Just thinking about all the times, she had begged for him, sent a\nsudden wave of euphoria crashing down on his body. Why? It was always during\ntheir lovemaking sessions. She had begged for him to go faster, rougher. She even\ndesired to scream his name while he sent wave after wave of pleasure throughout\nher body. </p><p>God,\nremembering how loud her moans had gotten while he was practically pounding her\npretty little pussy caused his dick to harden. </p><p>Out of\nall the times to become aroused, he had to pick a time where Sumin didn\u2019t seem\nlike in the mood. </p><p>The\njoys of being an adult male and in love with the prettiest woman on Earth. </p><p>The\nHoly Father had to hate him for not only having sex before their wedding but\nalso having these recurring naughty thoughts while a war was about to happen. </p><p>Sumin,\non the other hand, noticed the odd expression that appeared on her fianc\u00e9\u2019s\nface. A familiar emotion glazed over his eyes while his lips parted a tiny bit.\nHis breathing grew rapid, and his heart pounded against his chest. </p><p>Sumin\nfelt the urge to take a step back as she suddenly felt vulnerable. She glanced\nat her nurse and subtly dismissed her as she did not want an audience for what\nwas bound to happen next. </p><p>The\nnurse fought the urge to laugh as she shook her head and swiftly left the\nprincess\u2019s chambers. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThose children, I swear\u2026Sumin is\nbound to be with child if she and Seokjin do not lessen their lovemaking.\u201d She\nthought with an amusing smile. </p><p>Now\nalone in her chambers, Seokjin immediately captured her lips; his hands\ntenderly cupped her cheeks. His lips pressed firmly against hers as he slowly\nguided her to the bed and then gently laid her down, careful not to\naccidentally squish his lover. </p><p>Their\neyes bore into each other\u2019s; an intense amount of love that was unspoken\nbetween them. Whenever the childhood lovers were together, they rarely\nconfessed their love because it was never needed. Their hearts and minds knew\nhow the other felt, so\u2014 it was rarely said.</p><p>An\naspect of their bond that both Sumin and Seokjin loved and cherished. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou know\u2026I will never tire of\nseeing this sight,\u201d He pressed a light kiss on her nose, \u201cYou underneath me,\u201d\nHis hands trailed down the sides of her body, \u201cYour addicting lips slightly\nparted as my hardened member penetrates your womanhood.\u201d He finished, whispering\nseductively into her ear. </p><p>The\nwarmth in his breath, and his provocative words resulted in a soft moan to\nleave her lips. </p><p>Just\nhis mere words were enough to arouse Sumin. He had no need to touch her, and\nthat made Seokjin to swell up with pride. He just loved having this unexplainable\ncontrol over his princess and vice versa. Sumin had Seokjin like putty in her\nhands, and he was perfectly fine with that since it sometimes resulted in some\nnew and exciting adventures. </p><p>Speaking\nof which\u2026</p><p>A tiny\nsmirk slowly graced her face as a rather interesting idea popped into her mind.\nShe lightly pushed against Seokjin\u2019s chest, signaling that she wanted to sit\nup. Seokjin stared at her with nothing but confusion etched on his face as\ncreated enough space between them. Though, he already missed the closeness\nbetween them. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cAre you no longer in the mood,\nsweetheart?\u201d asked Seokjin.</p><p>Sumin\nlaughed softly, \u201cOh, there is no doubt in my mind that I want the two of us to\nengage in passionate lovemaking, but\u2026\u201d She trailed on, trying to figure out how\nto word what was on her mind. </p><p>Seokjin\nurged her to continue, finding the unexpected anticipation to be nerve\nwrecking.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cBut\u2026I am quite tired of being\nunderneath you, my love,\u201d She boldly pushed him down; his back now against her\nmattress, \u201cI believe that it is your turn to submit to me.\u201d She whispered\nseductively as her hands reached behind her and untied the strings to her\ndress. </p><p>Seokjin\nwatched eagerly as her breasts became slightly exposed due to her corset loosening\nup. His lips slightly ajar as he desperately wanted to attack the soft tissues\nof her skin with his lips. He desired to mark up her pretty neck as her hands\nclutched his hair, tugging it softly as she wanted more skin-on-skin contact. </p><p>Unfortunately,\nSumin positioned herself in a way that restrained his body enough so that he\ncould not sit up. She wanted him to simply relax and let her do all the work. An\naction that was considered a rarity in a princess, so Seokjin was in for a real\ntreat. </p><p>His lip\nslowly swept the bottom of his lip as Seokjin clenched and unclenched his\nfists. The restraints were killing him, and he wasn\u2019t even tied up. Seokjin\nblamed her archery teacher for building her upper body strength, and her\nhorseback riding teacher for allowing to build up her leg muscles. </p><p>As if she\nwasn\u2019t strong already\u2026Seokjin had traumatic flashbacks to when their mere\nchildren, and she always pinned him down onto the ground. </p><p>Damn\nwoman\u2026</p><p>With\nher torso completely exposed, Sumin brushed her fingers through her luscious\nlocks. Her semi-wavy hair cascaded down her face as she stared intensely at\nSeokjin. She lightly caressed her body, sending tiny jolts of electricity\nthroughout her. Her erect nipples ached to be touched by her lover\u2019s hands and\nmouth. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cS-Sumin\u2026please free my arms.\u201d Sumin\nheard Seokjin beg; the need to touch her delicate body became unbearable. </p><p>Sumin\npeeked down; a playful yet enticing smirk decorated her face. She raised her\nbrow before tapping her chin as she thought about his request.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cAnd why would I do that my beloved\nknight?\u201d asked Sumin, maintaining the sexy smirk. </p><p>A deep\ngroan developed in the back of his throat. Sumin was really pushing his\nbuttons, and it wasn\u2019t even nighttime yet. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cBecause, I know how much you\nlove\u2026how much you crave my touch, so please do us both a favor and free me.\u201d\nSeokjin calmly answered, stating the obvious. </p><p>Sumin\nhummed in response. Seokjin always tend to make incredibly good points,\nhowever, she had to remain strong and in control. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThat may be true, however, I want\nyou to know what it is like to be in my position,\u201d Her hands untucked the\ncotton shirt from his pants, \u201cI want you to feel the burning sensation that you\nmanaged to always leave on my body,\u201d She gently caressed his torso, feeling the\nhis six-pack in the process, \u201cI simply want you to enjoy what I have to give\nyou my dear knight.\u201d She finished softly before nipping his earlobe and pulling\naway. </p><p>Seokjin\ncouldn\u2019t help but growl lowly as this was pure torture. If she wanted to know\nwhat she felt like, she could\u2019ve just told him. He started to become a horrible\ninfluence on his not-so-innocent princess. </p><p>As he\nopened his mouth to argue\u2014even beg to at least let him rest his hands on her\nbare waist\u2014Sumin unbuttoned his pants and trailed her fingers down his holy\nv-line. </p><p>Seokjin\nsighed deeply as he felt her fingers wrap around his hardened length. The\nwarmth from her hands created this remarkable sensation that he couldn\u2019t help\nbut buckle his hips, thrusting himself into her hands.</p><p>Her\nhand began to rub up and down, pumping his dick, as her free hand disappeared\nunderneath her skirt and played with her clit. </p><p>Her\nthumb and index finger matched the pace of her other hand, leaving both her and\nSeokjin a moaning mess. </p><p>Their\nmoans gradually grew louder and louder as the urge to climax increased. </p><p>Sumin\nleaned backwards a little, allowing enough room for her to fully release\nSeokjin\u2019s dick from his pants. She then repositioned herself, letting just the\ntip to touch her soaking wet core.</p><p>Feeling\nhow insanely wet she was made Seokjin want to flip their positions and take her\nat once. He wanted to pound her cute little cunt until her moans practically\nbecame screams as he pinned her hands above her head. Her beautiful breasts\npushed against his naked torso as he rested his forehead against, filling her\nears with profanities and grunts. </p><p>However,\nhe decided to indulge his princess and let her be in complete and utter\ncontrol. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThis is new angle for you, my\ndarling. Take it nice and slow. Understand?\u201d Seokjin kindly advised,\nencouraging his future-wife as he sensed a bit of nervousness from her. </p><p>Hearing\nhis words of encouragement filled her heart with joy and sent a jolt of\nconfidence through her veins. Sumin took this newly found confidence and\nallowed it to fuel her. </p><p>She\nslowly lowered herself onto him; tiny gasps escaped her plump lips as she did. </p><p>Seokjin\ntried to control his breathing, however, it was proven quite difficult as he\nfelt both the warmth and wetness that came from Sumin. He was amazed with how\ntight she managed to feel. Yet, they had shared plenty of intimate moments. </p><p>The\nwonderful world of a woman\u2019s body\u2026</p><p>A\nconcept that Seokjin would simply enjoy and stop questioning. </p><p>He\nwatched with anticipation as he patiently waited for Sumin to adjust to the new\nangle and his size. He gently caressed her soft skin, muttering soothing and\nloving words. </p><p>Suddenly,\nhe felt Sumin\u2019s hand firmly placed on his chest, anchoring herself against him.\nThen, she lightly rocked herself; her hips lifted up just a bit before lowering\ndown. She repeated the action, gradually picking her pace as she arched her\nback and allowed the pleasurable sensation to take control.</p><p>The\nlust clouded both their minds. The love filled their hearts.</p><p>Both\nmoans and grunts echoed throughout her chambers as Sumin\u2019s rocking slowly\nbecame sloppy. </p><p>Her\ninner walls constricted around Seokjin; an action that signified that Sumin was\nclose to releasing. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cShit\u2026Sumin\u2026\u201d Seokjin grunted out,\nlosing his train of thought. </p><p>Luckily\nfor him, Sumin knew him well. She knew that he wanted them to climax together.\nHe wanted her sweet juices mixing with his. </p><p>She\nuttered a quick, \u201cI know.\u201d, before quickening her pace and rubbing her clit\nvigorously, intensifying the wave of pleasure that she experienced. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cS-Seokjin\u2026I am g-going to\u2026\u201d Sumin\nwhimpered, feeling Seokjin\u2019s fingers dig into her skin. </p><p>Seokjin\ngrunted in response as he thrusted upwards, meeting her halfway. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI know, my princess&hellip;I am almost\nthere too\u2026\u201d He mustered out; he too felt the urge to climax draw near. </p><p>With a\nfew sloppier rocking hip motions and thrusts, the princess and her knight saw a\nblanket of white. </p><p>Sumin\ncollapsed on top of Seokjin; her sweaty forehead rested against his sweaty\nshoulder. </p><p>Seokjin\nsoftly rubbed her back as he caught his breath and calmed his racing heart.</p><p>A few\nairy chuckles left his lips as Seokjin wrapped his muddled mind around the fact\nthat he found a new found favorite position. </p><p>He\nshould allow Sumin to be on top more often. He had full view of Sumin\u2019s\nbreasts, and her face contorted in pleasure. </p><p>What a\nmemorable sight\u2026</p><p>Seokjin\nwould remember it for the rest of his life. </p><p>After\ngathering enough strength, Sumin rolled off Seokjin and laid beside him,\nresting her head on his chest. </p><p>Seokjin\nwrapped his arm around her, pulling her even closer even though it was not\nremotely even possible. They were as close as can be. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI cannot believe that we had spent\nmost of the afternoon doing this\u2026\u201d He stated, chuckling. </p><p>Sumin\ngiggled softly, \u201cI know my sweet knight. I believe that we have made a new\nrecord.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI think we came quite close to be\nquite frank.\u201d Seokjin said, smiling warmly at her. </p><p>As\nSumin opened her mouth to speak, the lovers heard a light knock on the door. </p><p>Sumin\u2019s\neyes bulged as she quickly pulled the covers over her chest while Seokjin\nsnickered at her frantic behavior.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOh, my goodness. Sumin, I am almost\npositive that the castle workers know about our intimacy, so there is honestly\nno reason to hide it.\u201d He pointed out, earning him a smack and glare from\nSumin. </p><p>She\nthen shouted a quick, \u201center\u201d, before grabbing Seokjin\u2019s hands to prevent him\nfondling her under the sheets. </p><p>Moments\nlater, an out of breath castle servant came running in. The couple eyed the\nservant with curiosity. Why was he so tired? Did he honestly run all the way to\nher chambers? </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cSir Seokjin. Your highness. Your\nparents would like to request your presence for supper this evening.\u201d Announced\nthe royal messenger as he bowed his head in respect; though, he had been\ncareful to not lock gazes with them. </p><p>Sumin\nsmiled politely and acknowledged the message. She then instructed the messenger\nto tell her parents that she and Seokjin should be down shortly. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYes, milady. Excuse me.\u201d The royal\nmessenger bowed once more before quickly excusing himself from their sight. </p><p>Once\nthey heard the door shut, tiny snickers filled the room as the royal couple\ncould not help but feel pity towards the poor man. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cLet us not keep your mother and\nfather waiting much longer, princess.\u201d Seokjin suggested, pushing off the\ncovers and leaving the bed. He then bent down and picked up his discarded\nshirt. </p><p>Sumin\neyed his ass; an alluring smile painted on her lips. Her hormones were slowly\nworked up again, and Seokjin knew his princess all too well. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cStop eyeing me like how our horses\neye their carrots and get changed, Sumin.\u201d Seokjin instructed, securing his\nbelt around his pants. He wanted to look presentable since he was meeting his\nfuture-in-laws. </p><p>Sumin\npouted as she shuffled out of bed. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWow\u2026I cannot believe you called me\nby my actual name. You normally call me a pet name.\u201d She said, walking over to\nher wardrobe and scanning her many dresses. </p><p>Seokjin\nrolled his eyes, \u201cI do, but we need to hurry. I would fancy not having yet\nanother talk of when you are going to be with child.\u201d </p><p>Hearing\nhis statement caused Sumin to giggle softly as she picked out a dusty\nrose-colored dress and revealed her chose to Seokjin.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhat do you think, my beloved?\u201d\nasked Sumin, wanting her fianc\u00e9\u2019s opinion.</p><p>Seokjin\nturned around and eyed her dress of choice. His eyes scanned the incredible\nfloral detail in the lace that covered the satin dust rose skirt. The sleeves\nlooked like they would go past her elbows, and the straps would rest perfectly\non her shoulders. That tiny exposure was enough to rile him up yet still\nmaintained that sense of modesty. His fianc\u00e9e had wonderful taste in dresses.\nNow, if only she\u2019d fancy wearing them a lot more, then he would die a happy\nman. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIt is quite beautiful, my\nprincess.\u201d He confessed, smiling warmly. </p><p>Sumin\ngrinned brightly before disappearing to change into her dinner attire. Seconds\nlater, she resurfaced struggling to tie her dress. Sheesh, she could tie her\nsash, but she could not tie the strings that kept her corset nice and tight.\nThe last thing she needed was to reveal all the love marks that were <i>finally </i>fading. </p><p>Seokjin\nnoticed her struggles and cocked up his brow; an amused smirk graced his face. </p><p>He\ncalmly walked over to Sumin and offered his services. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cNo, I can do it!\u201d She refused,\nstill struggling. </p><p>Seokjin\ngave her look and asked if she was sure. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOh! Just help me, please!\u201d Sumin\npractically begged, growing annoyed with the fact that she needed help. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhy is that you dislike asking me\nfor help yet allow your lovely nurse to assist you with no problem?\u201d asked\nSeokjin as he quickly laced her corset and tightened the strings. </p><p>Sumin\nhuffed, \u201cThat is because that I have no choice but to allow her to assist me.\nYou know how stubborn that nanny can be.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhatever you say, sweetheart. You\njust do not like the idea of me helping you.\u201d Seokjin argued before placing a\nsweet kiss on her temple. </p><p>Sumin\nignored his comments and asked him if they could go down for supper, walking\ntowards the door and leaving behind Seokjin. </p><p>Seokjin\nwatched her retreating body create more space between them. Without a second\nthought, he rushed after. He shouted at her, demanding her to slow down and\nwait for him, but Sumin ignored him. </p><p>Here was\nher infamous \u201cplay hard to get\u201d mood\u2026</p><p>One\nwould think that Seokjin would have been used to this since she had always been\nlike that ever since they were children. However, it annoyed him back then, and\nit annoyed him now. </p><p>One of\nthe many moments where he questioned why he fell in love with this entertaining\nwoman. At least one thing was for certain, he would never grow bored of the\nsame old thing. </p><p>With\nthe dining hall in sight, Sumin peered over her shoulder and playfully winked\nat her frustrated knight. She quickly mouthed, \u201cI love you.\u201d, to him before\nmaking her presence known to her parents. </p><p>She\nhappily kissed her parents\u2019 cheeks and asked them how they were doing this fine\nevening as she took her usual seat\u2014right across from her mother and next to her\nfather, on his right side. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIt is always a delight to see your\nsmiling face, my treasured jewel.\u201d Sumin heard her father say. Hints of\ntiredness laced his voice. </p><p>Sumin\nremained smiling, wanting to the strength that both her parents desperately\nneeded during a time like this. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWell, you, mother, and Seokjin are\nmy reasons for smiling, so I am always quite happy.\u201d Sumin stated as she picked\nup her fork. </p><p>Sumin\u2019s\nfather nodded slowly; his eyes drooped a little bit. </p><p>Sumin\u2019s\nmother took noticed and nudged him slightly. Her heart ached for her ailing\nhusband. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cTell me daughter, how are yours and\nSeokjin\u2019s wedding preparation coming along? Do let me or your father know if\nthere is anything that you need.\u201d Sumin\u2019s mother inquired, fighting the urge to\nexcuse both her and her husband from the dinner table to rest in their\nchambers. </p><p>Sumin finished\nchewing the luxurious cut of meat and quickly patted her mouth with the napkin.\n</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cUm\u2026well\u2026the wedding preparations\nare currently on hold.\u201d She shyly admitted, glancing at Seokjin, who was\nequally as nervous. </p><p>Both\nher mother and father eyed with both confusion and curiosity. They had thought that\ntheir daughter and her fianc\u00e9 were close to being done. Now, they were hearing\nthat their wedding plans had been put on hold. Was it because of the war? </p><p>Sumin\u2019s\nfather gestured for Seokjin to come to the table which Seokjin obeyed. He left\nhis post and walked up to the royal family.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYes, your majesty.\u201d He greeted,\nbowing his head in respect. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cMay I ask why you and my daughter\npostponing the wedding?\u201d The king asked as he lifted his water goblet. </p><p>Seokjin\nnoted how shaky the king\u2019s hand was when he lifted the goblet. Poor Sumin. Her\nheart would be devastated once her father passes away. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cSumin and I discussed both the\nadvantages and disadvantages of having our wedding while there is talk of war,\nand we have concluded that it would be wise to wait until this over.\u201d Seokjin\nanswered, averting his gaze away from the king\u2019s. </p><p>The\nking rubbed his chin and directed his attention towards his daughter. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIs this true, Sumin?\u201d asked the\nKing, letting out a tiny painful groan. </p><p>Sumin\neyed her father with worried eyes; her heart honestly broke to see her father\nin such excruciating pain. She wanted nothing more to find a cure for whatever\nthat hurt her father. </p><p>Before\nshe could get carried away with her thoughts, her father called out to her,\nwondering why his daughter is unusually silent. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cMy deepest apologies, father. I am\nsimply worried about you and failing health is all.\u201d She said, smiling sadly. </p><p>Her\nfather fought the tears that slowly pooled in his eyes. He never once liked\nlooking frail in front of his family but lately, his body was not getting the\nmessage. He saw bits and pieces of his life flashing before his eyes. It was if\nthe Holy father was telling him that his time was ending. </p><p>He\nslowly reached over and gently grasped his daughter\u2019s hand. He smiled warmly at\nher as he rested her hand on his cheek, feeling the warmth radiate from it. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cPlease do not worry about your old\nman, my darling daughter. I will continue to fight whatever it is that riddles\nmy body, and I want you to smile more and worry less about your mother and I,\u201d\nHe then held his wife\u2019s hand, \u201cWe may be old, but we still have some fight left\nin us.\u201d He stated firmly with a determined smirk. </p><p>Sumin\nsimply nodded, not being able to find the next set of words. </p><p>Sumin\u2019s\nfather patted her on the bed and then excused himself from the table. It was\ntime for him and his wife to get plenty of rest. They had a long day ahead of\nthem tomorrow. </p><p>Sumin\nsaid goodnight to her parents and waited for them to leave the room before\nasking Seokjin if he wanted to take a walk with her. She desperately needed\nfresh air to clear her mind and erase the horrible sight that she was forced to\nwitness. </p><p>Small\ntears trickled down her face as short sniffles filled the dining hall, alerting\nthe castle staff. </p><p>They\ngrew unsure on what they should do next. Should they alert her parents? Should\nthey fetch her nanny? They hated seeing their beloved princess cry. </p><p>Luckily,\nthey didn\u2019t have to witness it much longer. Seokjin gently helped her up and\nwiped the tears away before it dropped to the floor. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIt will be alright, darling,\u201d\nSeokjin pecked her forehead, \u201cThe king and queen will be fine. They just need a\ngood night\u2019s rest is all.\u201d He said softly, soothing her worries away. </p><p>Sumin sniffled,\ntrying her hardest to stop the tears but ultimately failing. She then pressed\nher face to Seokjin\u2019s chest, soaking his cotton shirt. Her sobs became\nuncontrollable. No words left her lips. Just choked out cries. </p><p>Seokjin\nrested his cheek on top of her head and gently rubbed her back. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cCome, my love. Let us take a walk\nin the garden. I know there is something else bothering you.\u201d He suggested,\nslowly escorting the two of them out of the castle walls. </p><p>The\ncool breeze greeted the lovers first followed by the soothing smell of the\nsalty waves. The crescent moon barely peeped through the trees as it tried its\nhardest to illuminate the garden. Luckily, the glorious moon had the help from\nmany stars that twinkled high in the sky. </p><p>Seeing\nthe moon and starts, even maybe a few planets that decided to grace the world,\nalways brought a sense of tranquility within Sumin. She closed her eyes and\ndrank in the calming atmosphere that appeared before them. </p><p>Silence\nfilled the space between them, however, it was a comfortable silence. Seokjin\nknew what Sumin was about to say and vice versa. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cAre you worried about me fighting\nin this war?\u201d asked Seokjin, lacing his fingers with hers. </p><p>Sumin\nsqueezed his hand and replied, \u201cI am not worried. I am afraid.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhy are you afraid, sweetheart?\u201d\nSeokjin questioned. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI am afraid that you will not come\nback to me. I cannot bear the thought of losing both you and my father. You two\nare the most important men in my life. How can I go on living on this Earth\nwhere the two of you are not here?\u201d Sumin confessed her innermost concerns. Her\nheart pounded against the chest. The oxygen slowly left her lungs as she felt\nthis weird and tight feeling in the pit of her stomach. </p><p>Seokjin\nheard Sumin\u2019s sporadic breathing and pulled her into a loving embrace. He\nrested his chin on top of her head and uttered words of love and comfort. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI do not want to marry that horrid\nKing Ji Yong. I will not!\u201d Sumin declared, alerting Seokjin.</p><p>Upon\nhearing his name, Seokjin\u2019s body immediately tensed, and a sudden wave of fury\nengulfed his body. That evil king would not leave his princess alone, and\nSeokjin had grown tired of him. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cSumin, what are you talking about?\u201d\nSeokjin inquired, glancing down at her. </p><p>Sumin\nremained silent, unsure if she should finally tell him the truth. </p><p>After\nquickly debating, Sumin opened her mouth and said,</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIt is King Ji Yong\u2026 he\u2026\u201d</p><hr><p><small><b>A/N: </b>Oh my goodness! We are nearing the end of my favorite story that I had ever written to date. I honestly feel like that the love I bear for Seokjin shows in my mind, and I wouldn\u2019t have it any other way! He deserves nothing but the best! Anyway, I hope you up like this update and~ as of today (7.16.2018 // I already wrote this and then scheduled it to be published lol), I\u2019m thinking that the first chapter of the sequel should be up sometime in August!

Seagulls flew high in the air as the breeze\nassisted them along the way. Nothing but the sounds of nature entered the\ncastle grounds.</p><p>Why was\nthis once beloved kingdom so quiet? What happened to the lively chatter that\nwent on between every villager? </p><p>Pending\nwar. That\u2019s what happened. </p><p>The\nonce neutral king now became ready for battle as the lives of his people were\non the line. The kind mask he wore on his face now was a face of anger and\nstress. </p><p>Princess\nSumin worried for him as did his wife. Their enemies must\u2019ve known about his\ndepleting health, and that was why there were attacking. </p><p>After a\nyear of silence and being left alone, what triggered them? What angered these\nprideful kings to the point of rejecting every offer for peace?</p><p>Unfortunately,\nthe answers that formulated in the royal family\u2019s minds were all wrong. It\nwasn\u2019t a matter of what, but who. </p><p>To be\nmore precise, it was all because of King Ji Yong\u2014and Sumin and her family had\nno idea.</p><p>Except\u2026</p><p>Maybe\nfor Kim Seokjin.</p><p>Something\nabout that deceitful king never sat right with him\u2014especially since Ji Yong had\nhis eyes on Princess Sumin. <i>His </i>princess.\n</p><p>Sumin.</p><p>Everyone\u2019s\nprized jewel. </p><p>Too bad\nfor Ji Yong that she fell in love with Seokjin. Now, they were engaged to be\nmarried. Sumin proudly wore his ring around her neck on a rose gold chain as\nthey both agreed that they should keep it hidden until after the war. </p><p>Something\nabout this war screamed planned\u2014intentional. </p><p>After\nnews about Sumin\u2019s betrothal to her knight spread to the other kingdoms, an\nextreme amount of tension filled the air. Even a tiny glare could easily start\na bloody war. </p><p>Right\nnow, Seokjin stood by Sumin\u2019s father side and continued to discuss plans for\nthe upcoming battle. </p><p>While\nwith Sumin, she continued to receive letters from Ji Yong, and there were\nalways accompanied with a single red rose. </p><p>Her\neyes scanned the parchment tainted with ink as rolled her eyes for the nth time\nthat afternoon. She felt the urge to vomit as Ji Yong\u2019s \u201cfriendly\u201d words always\nseemed to cross unspeakable boundaries. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cNurse!\u201d She cried out, crumpling up\nthe paper. </p><p>Seconds\nlater, her nurse arrived a bit out of breath. The elderly woman bowed her head\nin respect, much to Sumin\u2019s dismay. She had always told the poor woman that\nthere was no need for formalities since she was like her second mother. While\nher mother ran the kingdom alongside her father, the nurse cared and loved for\nSumin as if she was her own. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYes, princess?\u201d The nurse answered,\nignoring Sumin\u2019s pointless protests. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cFirst, can you please stop bowing\nyour head to me. It is quite odd. Second, please burn this note,\u201d She handed\nover the note to the nurse, \u201cIt is from Ji Yong yet again.\u201d She said, rubbing\nthe sides of her forehead. </p><p>The\nnurse felt nothing but pity towards her princess. Ever since that awful king\nreturned to his kingdom, he had yet to cease with his advances. In fact, they\nbecame frequent once the news of Sumin\u2019s engagement reached him. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cDoes Seokjin know about these\nletters?\u201d asked the Nurse as she folded up the letter and tucked it away in the\npocket of her skirt. </p><p>Sumin\u2019s\nbreath hitched. Her heart stopped for a split second. A nervous expression\nappeared on her face as she tried to figure out how to politely tell her dear\nfriend the truth. </p><p>However,\nthe nurse took her lack of speech as a no. Then, she gave the young princess a\nlook.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhy have you not told your knight\nabout these letters? I am almost certain that if he did indeed know about these\nappalling words from King Ji Yong, Seokjin would put in an immediate stop to\nthem.\u201d The nurse said, reasoning with the secretly scared princess. </p><p>Sumin\nsighed deeply, \u201cBecause, I have heard talks of him acting as a general for our\narmy. Fighting in my father\u2019s place,\u201d She paused; a look of utter concern\nglazed over her eyes, \u201cI do not want to trouble him with such tiny problems.\u201d\nShe finished.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOh, hush child. He is to be your\nfuture-husband. It is his job to know and take care of your problems as it is\nyour job to take care of his as well.\u201d The nurse retorted, waving off her\nexcuses. </p><p>Sumin\ngawked. Throughout her years of living, never once has she heard her dear nurse\nuse such a tone. Sumin honestly thought that her nurse was capable of such a\nthing. Most of the time, the nurse\u2019s tone was always lighthearted and quite\nplayful. Sometimes, she would use a stern tone, but only to discipline the\nprincess when she was a child. Now? This was an entirely different tone\u2014and\nthat impressed Sumin just a tiny bit.</p><p> As Sumin opened her mouth to give compliments\nto her second mother, a light knock echoed throughout her chambers.</p><p>A look\nof confusion washed over face as both Sumin and the nursed eyed each other,\nwondering what or who could that be. </p><p>Sumin\nknew that it could not have been her knight since he had sent a message telling\nher that he would be with her father all day. </p><p>Not\nwasting another moment, Sumin instructed the nurse to answer the door and\nwaited patiently for the so-called intruder to enter her line of sight. </p><p>Suddenly,\na short gasp escaped her lips followed by a squeal of delight. She bundled up\nher skirt and ran full-force into the person\u2019s arms. </p><p>A\nbright smile painted her lips as she breathed in the person\u2019s musky scent. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou know\u2026if I had known that this\nwould be the sort of welcome I would be privileged to, then I would have left\nyour father\u2019s side a long time ago.\u201d Teased a familiar voice. </p><p>Sumin\nglanced up; love and happiness sparkled in her eyes. She had longed for his\npresence ever since there had been hints of war that lingered in the air. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOh, hush. You know you missed me as\nmuch as I had missed you, Seokjin.\u201d Sumin teased back, smirking playfully. </p><p>Seokjin\nnodded as he could not argue with his smart princess. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI believe that I had missed a tad bit\nmore than you, but I will allow you to believe that we have longed for each\nother equally.\u201d He said jokingly. </p><p>Sumin\nreleased him from her hold and took a step back. A tiny pout replaced the bright\nsmile that graced her lips. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou are unbelievable Sir Seokjin,\u201d\nShe crossed her arms over her chest, \u201cI believe I have tolerated your presence\nlong enough. Now, leave my sight.\u201d She demanded coldly, fighting the urge to\nsmile. </p><p>Seokjin\nraised his brow, deciding if he wanted to call her bluff or do as he was told.\nAfter quickly debating, he chose the latter. He always loved to hear Sumin beg\nfor him. Just thinking about all the times, she had begged for him, sent a\nsudden wave of euphoria crashing down on his body. Why? It was always during\ntheir lovemaking sessions. She had begged for him to go faster, rougher. She even\ndesired to scream his name while he sent wave after wave of pleasure throughout\nher body. </p><p>God,\nremembering how loud her moans had gotten while he was practically pounding her\npretty little pussy caused his dick to harden. </p><p>Out of\nall the times to become aroused, he had to pick a time where Sumin didn\u2019t seem\nlike in the mood. </p><p>The\njoys of being an adult male and in love with the prettiest woman on Earth. </p><p>The\nHoly Father had to hate him for not only having sex before their wedding but\nalso having these recurring naughty thoughts while a war was about to happen. </p><p>Sumin,\non the other hand, noticed the odd expression that appeared on her fianc\u00e9\u2019s\nface. A familiar emotion glazed over his eyes while his lips parted a tiny bit.\nHis breathing grew rapid, and his heart pounded against his chest. </p><p>Sumin\nfelt the urge to take a step back as she suddenly felt vulnerable. She glanced\nat her nurse and subtly dismissed her as she did not want an audience for what\nwas bound to happen next. </p><p>The\nnurse fought the urge to laugh as she shook her head and swiftly left the\nprincess\u2019s chambers. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThose children, I swear\u2026Sumin is\nbound to be with child if she and Seokjin do not lessen their lovemaking.\u201d She\nthought with an amusing smile. </p><p>Now\nalone in her chambers, Seokjin immediately captured her lips; his hands\ntenderly cupped her cheeks. His lips pressed firmly against hers as he slowly\nguided her to the bed and then gently laid her down, careful not to\naccidentally squish his lover. </p><p>Their\neyes bore into each other\u2019s; an intense amount of love that was unspoken\nbetween them. Whenever the childhood lovers were together, they rarely\nconfessed their love because it was never needed. Their hearts and minds knew\nhow the other felt, so\u2014 it was rarely said.</p><p>An\naspect of their bond that both Sumin and Seokjin loved and cherished. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou know\u2026I will never tire of\nseeing this sight,\u201d He pressed a light kiss on her nose, \u201cYou underneath me,\u201d\nHis hands trailed down the sides of her body, \u201cYour addicting lips slightly\nparted as my hardened member penetrates your womanhood.\u201d He finished, whispering\nseductively into her ear. </p><p>The\nwarmth in his breath, and his provocative words resulted in a soft moan to\nleave her lips. </p><p>Just\nhis mere words were enough to arouse Sumin. He had no need to touch her, and\nthat made Seokjin to swell up with pride. He just loved having this unexplainable\ncontrol over his princess and vice versa. Sumin had Seokjin like putty in her\nhands, and he was perfectly fine with that since it sometimes resulted in some\nnew and exciting adventures. </p><p>Speaking\nof which\u2026</p><p>A tiny\nsmirk slowly graced her face as a rather interesting idea popped into her mind.\nShe lightly pushed against Seokjin\u2019s chest, signaling that she wanted to sit\nup. Seokjin stared at her with nothing but confusion etched on his face as\ncreated enough space between them. Though, he already missed the closeness\nbetween them. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cAre you no longer in the mood,\nsweetheart?\u201d asked Seokjin.</p><p>Sumin\nlaughed softly, \u201cOh, there is no doubt in my mind that I want the two of us to\nengage in passionate lovemaking, but\u2026\u201d She trailed on, trying to figure out how\nto word what was on her mind. </p><p>Seokjin\nurged her to continue, finding the unexpected anticipation to be nerve\nwrecking.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cBut\u2026I am quite tired of being\nunderneath you, my love,\u201d She boldly pushed him down; his back now against her\nmattress, \u201cI believe that it is your turn to submit to me.\u201d She whispered\nseductively as her hands reached behind her and untied the strings to her\ndress. </p><p>Seokjin\nwatched eagerly as her breasts became slightly exposed due to her corset loosening\nup. His lips slightly ajar as he desperately wanted to attack the soft tissues\nof her skin with his lips. He desired to mark up her pretty neck as her hands\nclutched his hair, tugging it softly as she wanted more skin-on-skin contact. </p><p>Unfortunately,\nSumin positioned herself in a way that restrained his body enough so that he\ncould not sit up. She wanted him to simply relax and let her do all the work. An\naction that was considered a rarity in a princess, so Seokjin was in for a real\ntreat. </p><p>His lip\nslowly swept the bottom of his lip as Seokjin clenched and unclenched his\nfists. The restraints were killing him, and he wasn\u2019t even tied up. Seokjin\nblamed her archery teacher for building her upper body strength, and her\nhorseback riding teacher for allowing to build up her leg muscles. </p><p>As if she\nwasn\u2019t strong already\u2026Seokjin had traumatic flashbacks to when their mere\nchildren, and she always pinned him down onto the ground. </p><p>Damn\nwoman\u2026</p><p>With\nher torso completely exposed, Sumin brushed her fingers through her luscious\nlocks. Her semi-wavy hair cascaded down her face as she stared intensely at\nSeokjin. She lightly caressed her body, sending tiny jolts of electricity\nthroughout her. Her erect nipples ached to be touched by her lover\u2019s hands and\nmouth. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cS-Sumin\u2026please free my arms.\u201d Sumin\nheard Seokjin beg; the need to touch her delicate body became unbearable. </p><p>Sumin\npeeked down; a playful yet enticing smirk decorated her face. She raised her\nbrow before tapping her chin as she thought about his request.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cAnd why would I do that my beloved\nknight?\u201d asked Sumin, maintaining the sexy smirk. </p><p>A deep\ngroan developed in the back of his throat. Sumin was really pushing his\nbuttons, and it wasn\u2019t even nighttime yet. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cBecause, I know how much you\nlove\u2026how much you crave my touch, so please do us both a favor and free me.\u201d\nSeokjin calmly answered, stating the obvious. </p><p>Sumin\nhummed in response. Seokjin always tend to make incredibly good points,\nhowever, she had to remain strong and in control. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThat may be true, however, I want\nyou to know what it is like to be in my position,\u201d Her hands untucked the\ncotton shirt from his pants, \u201cI want you to feel the burning sensation that you\nmanaged to always leave on my body,\u201d She gently caressed his torso, feeling the\nhis six-pack in the process, \u201cI simply want you to enjoy what I have to give\nyou my dear knight.\u201d She finished softly before nipping his earlobe and pulling\naway. </p><p>Seokjin\ncouldn\u2019t help but growl lowly as this was pure torture. If she wanted to know\nwhat she felt like, she could\u2019ve just told him. He started to become a horrible\ninfluence on his not-so-innocent princess. </p><p>As he\nopened his mouth to argue\u2014even beg to at least let him rest his hands on her\nbare waist\u2014Sumin unbuttoned his pants and trailed her fingers down his holy\nv-line. </p><p>Seokjin\nsighed deeply as he felt her fingers wrap around his hardened length. The\nwarmth from her hands created this remarkable sensation that he couldn\u2019t help\nbut buckle his hips, thrusting himself into her hands.</p><p>Her\nhand began to rub up and down, pumping his dick, as her free hand disappeared\nunderneath her skirt and played with her clit. </p><p>Her\nthumb and index finger matched the pace of her other hand, leaving both her and\nSeokjin a moaning mess. </p><p>Their\nmoans gradually grew louder and louder as the urge to climax increased. </p><p>Sumin\nleaned backwards a little, allowing enough room for her to fully release\nSeokjin\u2019s dick from his pants. She then repositioned herself, letting just the\ntip to touch her soaking wet core.</p><p>Feeling\nhow insanely wet she was made Seokjin want to flip their positions and take her\nat once. He wanted to pound her cute little cunt until her moans practically\nbecame screams as he pinned her hands above her head. Her beautiful breasts\npushed against his naked torso as he rested his forehead against, filling her\nears with profanities and grunts. </p><p>However,\nhe decided to indulge his princess and let her be in complete and utter\ncontrol. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThis is new angle for you, my\ndarling. Take it nice and slow. Understand?\u201d Seokjin kindly advised,\nencouraging his future-wife as he sensed a bit of nervousness from her. </p><p>Hearing\nhis words of encouragement filled her heart with joy and sent a jolt of\nconfidence through her veins. Sumin took this newly found confidence and\nallowed it to fuel her. </p><p>She\nslowly lowered herself onto him; tiny gasps escaped her plump lips as she did. </p><p>Seokjin\ntried to control his breathing, however, it was proven quite difficult as he\nfelt both the warmth and wetness that came from Sumin. He was amazed with how\ntight she managed to feel. Yet, they had shared plenty of intimate moments. </p><p>The\nwonderful world of a woman\u2019s body\u2026</p><p>A\nconcept that Seokjin would simply enjoy and stop questioning. </p><p>He\nwatched with anticipation as he patiently waited for Sumin to adjust to the new\nangle and his size. He gently caressed her soft skin, muttering soothing and\nloving words. </p><p>Suddenly,\nhe felt Sumin\u2019s hand firmly placed on his chest, anchoring herself against him.\nThen, she lightly rocked herself; her hips lifted up just a bit before lowering\ndown. She repeated the action, gradually picking her pace as she arched her\nback and allowed the pleasurable sensation to take control.</p><p>The\nlust clouded both their minds. The love filled their hearts.</p><p>Both\nmoans and grunts echoed throughout her chambers as Sumin\u2019s rocking slowly\nbecame sloppy. </p><p>Her\ninner walls constricted around Seokjin; an action that signified that Sumin was\nclose to releasing. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cShit\u2026Sumin\u2026\u201d Seokjin grunted out,\nlosing his train of thought. </p><p>Luckily\nfor him, Sumin knew him well. She knew that he wanted them to climax together.\nHe wanted her sweet juices mixing with his. </p><p>She\nuttered a quick, \u201cI know.\u201d, before quickening her pace and rubbing her clit\nvigorously, intensifying the wave of pleasure that she experienced. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cS-Seokjin\u2026I am g-going to\u2026\u201d Sumin\nwhimpered, feeling Seokjin\u2019s fingers dig into her skin. </p><p>Seokjin\ngrunted in response as he thrusted upwards, meeting her halfway. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI know, my princess\u2026I am almost\nthere too\u2026\u201d He mustered out; he too felt the urge to climax draw near. </p><p>With a\nfew sloppier rocking hip motions and thrusts, the princess and her knight saw a\nblanket of white. </p><p>Sumin\ncollapsed on top of Seokjin; her sweaty forehead rested against his sweaty\nshoulder. </p><p>Seokjin\nsoftly rubbed her back as he caught his breath and calmed his racing heart.</p><p>A few\nairy chuckles left his lips as Seokjin wrapped his muddled mind around the fact\nthat he found a new found favorite position. </p><p>He\nshould allow Sumin to be on top more often. He had full view of Sumin\u2019s\nbreasts, and her face contorted in pleasure. </p><p>What a\nmemorable sight\u2026</p><p>Seokjin\nwould remember it for the rest of his life. </p><p>After\ngathering enough strength, Sumin rolled off Seokjin and laid beside him,\nresting her head on his chest. </p><p>Seokjin\nwrapped his arm around her, pulling her even closer even though it was not\nremotely even possible. They were as close as can be. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI cannot believe that we had spent\nmost of the afternoon doing this\u2026\u201d He stated, chuckling. </p><p>Sumin\ngiggled softly, \u201cI know my sweet knight. I believe that we have made a new\nrecord.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI think we came quite close to be\nquite frank.\u201d Seokjin said, smiling warmly at her. </p><p>As\nSumin opened her mouth to speak, the lovers heard a light knock on the door. </p><p>Sumin\u2019s\neyes bulged as she quickly pulled the covers over her chest while Seokjin\nsnickered at her frantic behavior.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOh, my goodness. Sumin, I am almost\npositive that the castle workers know about our intimacy, so there is honestly\nno reason to hide it.\u201d He pointed out, earning him a smack and glare from\nSumin. </p><p>She\nthen shouted a quick, \u201center\u201d, before grabbing Seokjin\u2019s hands to prevent him\nfondling her under the sheets. </p><p>Moments\nlater, an out of breath castle servant came running in. The couple eyed the\nservant with curiosity. Why was he so tired? Did he honestly run all the way to\nher chambers? </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cSir Seokjin. Your highness. Your\nparents would like to request your presence for supper this evening.\u201d Announced\nthe royal messenger as he bowed his head in respect; though, he had been\ncareful to not lock gazes with them. </p><p>Sumin\nsmiled politely and acknowledged the message. She then instructed the messenger\nto tell her parents that she and Seokjin should be down shortly. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYes, milady. Excuse me.\u201d The royal\nmessenger bowed once more before quickly excusing himself from their sight. </p><p>Once\nthey heard the door shut, tiny snickers filled the room as the royal couple\ncould not help but feel pity towards the poor man. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cLet us not keep your mother and\nfather waiting much longer, princess.\u201d Seokjin suggested, pushing off the\ncovers and leaving the bed. He then bent down and picked up his discarded\nshirt. </p><p>Sumin\neyed his ass; an alluring smile painted on her lips. Her hormones were slowly\nworked up again, and Seokjin knew his princess all too well. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cStop eyeing me like how our horses\neye their carrots and get changed, Sumin.\u201d Seokjin instructed, securing his\nbelt around his pants. He wanted to look presentable since he was meeting his\nfuture-in-laws. </p><p>Sumin\npouted as she shuffled out of bed. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWow\u2026I cannot believe you called me\nby my actual name. You normally call me a pet name.\u201d She said, walking over to\nher wardrobe and scanning her many dresses. </p><p>Seokjin\nrolled his eyes, \u201cI do, but we need to hurry. I would fancy not having yet\nanother talk of when you are going to be with child.\u201d </p><p>Hearing\nhis statement caused Sumin to giggle softly as she picked out a dusty\nrose-colored dress and revealed her chose to Seokjin.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhat do you think, my beloved?\u201d\nasked Sumin, wanting her fianc\u00e9\u2019s opinion.</p><p>Seokjin\nturned around and eyed her dress of choice. His eyes scanned the incredible\nfloral detail in the lace that covered the satin dust rose skirt. The sleeves\nlooked like they would go past her elbows, and the straps would rest perfectly\non her shoulders. That tiny exposure was enough to rile him up yet still\nmaintained that sense of modesty. His fianc\u00e9e had wonderful taste in dresses.\nNow, if only she\u2019d fancy wearing them a lot more, then he would die a happy\nman. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIt is quite beautiful, my\nprincess.\u201d He confessed, smiling warmly. </p><p>Sumin\ngrinned brightly before disappearing to change into her dinner attire. Seconds\nlater, she resurfaced struggling to tie her dress. Sheesh, she could tie her\nsash, but she could not tie the strings that kept her corset nice and tight.\nThe last thing she needed was to reveal all the love marks that were <i>finally </i>fading. </p><p>Seokjin\nnoticed her struggles and cocked up his brow; an amused smirk graced his face. </p><p>He\ncalmly walked over to Sumin and offered his services. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cNo, I can do it!\u201d She refused,\nstill struggling. </p><p>Seokjin\ngave her look and asked if she was sure. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOh! Just help me, please!\u201d Sumin\npractically begged, growing annoyed with the fact that she needed help. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhy is that you dislike asking me\nfor help yet allow your lovely nurse to assist you with no problem?\u201d asked\nSeokjin as he quickly laced her corset and tightened the strings. </p><p>Sumin\nhuffed, \u201cThat is because that I have no choice but to allow her to assist me.\nYou know how stubborn that nanny can be.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhatever you say, sweetheart. You\njust do not like the idea of me helping you.\u201d Seokjin argued before placing a\nsweet kiss on her temple. </p><p>Sumin\nignored his comments and asked him if they could go down for supper, walking\ntowards the door and leaving behind Seokjin. </p><p>Seokjin\nwatched her retreating body create more space between them. Without a second\nthought, he rushed after. He shouted at her, demanding her to slow down and\nwait for him, but Sumin ignored him. </p><p>Here was\nher infamous \u201cplay hard to get\u201d mood\u2026</p><p>One\nwould think that Seokjin would have been used to this since she had always been\nlike that ever since they were children. However, it annoyed him back then, and\nit annoyed him now. </p><p>One of\nthe many moments where he questioned why he fell in love with this entertaining\nwoman. At least one thing was for certain, he would never grow bored of the\nsame old thing. </p><p>With\nthe dining hall in sight, Sumin peered over her shoulder and playfully winked\nat her frustrated knight. She quickly mouthed, \u201cI love you.\u201d, to him before\nmaking her presence known to her parents. </p><p>She\nhappily kissed her parents\u2019 cheeks and asked them how they were doing this fine\nevening as she took her usual seat\u2014right across from her mother and next to her\nfather, on his right side. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIt is always a delight to see your\nsmiling face, my treasured jewel.\u201d Sumin heard her father say. Hints of\ntiredness laced his voice. </p><p>Sumin\nremained smiling, wanting to the strength that both her parents desperately\nneeded during a time like this. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWell, you, mother, and Seokjin are\nmy reasons for smiling, so I am always quite happy.\u201d Sumin stated as she picked\nup her fork. </p><p>Sumin\u2019s\nfather nodded slowly; his eyes drooped a little bit. </p><p>Sumin\u2019s\nmother took noticed and nudged him slightly. Her heart ached for her ailing\nhusband. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cTell me daughter, how are yours and\nSeokjin\u2019s wedding preparation coming along? Do let me or your father know if\nthere is anything that you need.\u201d Sumin\u2019s mother inquired, fighting the urge to\nexcuse both her and her husband from the dinner table to rest in their\nchambers. </p><p>Sumin finished\nchewing the luxurious cut of meat and quickly patted her mouth with the napkin.\n</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cUm\u2026well\u2026the wedding preparations\nare currently on hold.\u201d She shyly admitted, glancing at Seokjin, who was\nequally as nervous. </p><p>Both\nher mother and father eyed with both confusion and curiosity. They had thought that\ntheir daughter and her fianc\u00e9 were close to being done. Now, they were hearing\nthat their wedding plans had been put on hold. Was it because of the war? </p><p>Sumin\u2019s\nfather gestured for Seokjin to come to the table which Seokjin obeyed. He left\nhis post and walked up to the royal family.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYes, your majesty.\u201d He greeted,\nbowing his head in respect. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cMay I ask why you and my daughter\npostponing the wedding?\u201d The king asked as he lifted his water goblet. </p><p>Seokjin\nnoted how shaky the king\u2019s hand was when he lifted the goblet. Poor Sumin. Her\nheart would be devastated once her father passes away. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cSumin and I discussed both the\nadvantages and disadvantages of having our wedding while there is talk of war,\nand we have concluded that it would be wise to wait until this over.\u201d Seokjin\nanswered, averting his gaze away from the king\u2019s. </p><p>The\nking rubbed his chin and directed his attention towards his daughter. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIs this true, Sumin?\u201d asked the\nKing, letting out a tiny painful groan. </p><p>Sumin\neyed her father with worried eyes; her heart honestly broke to see her father\nin such excruciating pain. She wanted nothing more to find a cure for whatever\nthat hurt her father. </p><p>Before\nshe could get carried away with her thoughts, her father called out to her,\nwondering why his daughter is unusually silent. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cMy deepest apologies, father. I am\nsimply worried about you and failing health is all.\u201d She said, smiling sadly. </p><p>Her\nfather fought the tears that slowly pooled in his eyes. He never once liked\nlooking frail in front of his family but lately, his body was not getting the\nmessage. He saw bits and pieces of his life flashing before his eyes. It was if\nthe Holy father was telling him that his time was ending. </p><p>He\nslowly reached over and gently grasped his daughter\u2019s hand. He smiled warmly at\nher as he rested her hand on his cheek, feeling the warmth radiate from it. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cPlease do not worry about your old\nman, my darling daughter. I will continue to fight whatever it is that riddles\nmy body, and I want you to smile more and worry less about your mother and I,\u201d\nHe then held his wife\u2019s hand, \u201cWe may be old, but we still have some fight left\nin us.\u201d He stated firmly with a determined smirk. </p><p>Sumin\nsimply nodded, not being able to find the next set of words. </p><p>Sumin\u2019s\nfather patted her on the bed and then excused himself from the table. It was\ntime for him and his wife to get plenty of rest. They had a long day ahead of\nthem tomorrow. </p><p>Sumin\nsaid goodnight to her parents and waited for them to leave the room before\nasking Seokjin if he wanted to take a walk with her. She desperately needed\nfresh air to clear her mind and erase the horrible sight that she was forced to\nwitness. </p><p>Small\ntears trickled down her face as short sniffles filled the dining hall, alerting\nthe castle staff. </p><p>They\ngrew unsure on what they should do next. Should they alert her parents? Should\nthey fetch her nanny? They hated seeing their beloved princess cry. </p><p>Luckily,\nthey didn\u2019t have to witness it much longer. Seokjin gently helped her up and\nwiped the tears away before it dropped to the floor. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIt will be alright, darling,\u201d\nSeokjin pecked her forehead, \u201cThe king and queen will be fine. They just need a\ngood night\u2019s rest is all.\u201d He said softly, soothing her worries away. </p><p>Sumin sniffled,\ntrying her hardest to stop the tears but ultimately failing. She then pressed\nher face to Seokjin\u2019s chest, soaking his cotton shirt. Her sobs became\nuncontrollable. No words left her lips. Just choked out cries. </p><p>Seokjin\nrested his cheek on top of her head and gently rubbed her back. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cCome, my love. Let us take a walk\nin the garden. I know there is something else bothering you.\u201d He suggested,\nslowly escorting the two of them out of the castle walls. </p><p>The\ncool breeze greeted the lovers first followed by the soothing smell of the\nsalty waves. The crescent moon barely peeped through the trees as it tried its\nhardest to illuminate the garden. Luckily, the glorious moon had the help from\nmany stars that twinkled high in the sky. </p><p>Seeing\nthe moon and starts, even maybe a few planets that decided to grace the world,\nalways brought a sense of tranquility within Sumin. She closed her eyes and\ndrank in the calming atmosphere that appeared before them. </p><p>Silence\nfilled the space between them, however, it was a comfortable silence. Seokjin\nknew what Sumin was about to say and vice versa. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cAre you worried about me fighting\nin this war?\u201d asked Seokjin, lacing his fingers with hers. </p><p>Sumin\nsqueezed his hand and replied, \u201cI am not worried. I am afraid.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhy are you afraid, sweetheart?\u201d\nSeokjin questioned. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI am afraid that you will not come\nback to me. I cannot bear the thought of losing both you and my father. You two\nare the most important men in my life. How can I go on living on this Earth\nwhere the two of you are not here?\u201d Sumin confessed her innermost concerns. Her\nheart pounded against the chest. The oxygen slowly left her lungs as she felt\nthis weird and tight feeling in the pit of her stomach. </p><p>Seokjin\nheard Sumin\u2019s sporadic breathing and pulled her into a loving embrace. He\nrested his chin on top of her head and uttered words of love and comfort. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI do not want to marry that horrid\nKing Ji Yong. I will not!\u201d Sumin declared, alerting Seokjin.</p><p>Upon\nhearing his name, Seokjin\u2019s body immediately tensed, and a sudden wave of fury\nengulfed his body. That evil king would not leave his princess alone, and\nSeokjin had grown tired of him. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cSumin, what are you talking about?\u201d\nSeokjin inquired, glancing down at her. </p><p>Sumin\nremained silent, unsure if she should finally tell him the truth. </p><p>After\nquickly debating, Sumin opened her mouth and said,</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIt is King Ji Yong\u2026 he\u2026\u201d</p><hr><p><small><b>A/N: </b>Oh my goodness! We are nearing the end of my favorite story that I had ever written to date. I honestly feel like that the love I bear for Seokjin shows in my mind, and I wouldn\u2019t have it any other way! He deserves nothing but the best! Anyway, I hope you up like this update and~ as of today (7.16.2018 // I already wrote this and then scheduled it to be published lol), I\u2019m thinking that the first chapter of the sequel should be up sometime in August!

In that kingdom, the royal family had the freedom of marrying whoever his or her royal highness deems worthy. Now, of course, having that special privilege came with some interesting challenges, but that doesn\u2019t stop a certain head-strong princess from doing whatever her heart\u2019s desire, especially when she has her heart set on marrying her personal bodyguard. Unfortunately, her beliefs might face some hardships when a certain king sets his eye on her. Will her bodyguard continue to fight for her or is it finally her turn?</small></p><p><small>\u203b <b>Previously: </b><a href=\"http://jinniesbby.tumblr.com/post/175791445214/fight-for-me-ch1\">ch.1</a>\u00a0| <a href=\"http://jinniesbby.tumblr.com/post/175887448405/fight-for-me-ch2\">ch.2</a> | <a href=\"http://jinniesbby.tumblr.com/post/175993838175/fight-for-me-ch3\">ch.3</a> | <a href=\"http://jinniesbby.tumblr.com/post/176061680692/fight-for-me-ch4\">ch.4</a> | <a href=\"http://jinniesbby.tumblr.com/post/176129746496/fight-for-me-ch5\">ch.5</a><br></small></p><p><small>\u203b <b>Next Time:</b> <a href=\"http://jinniesbby.tumblr.com/post/176307635761/fight-for-me-final-chapter\">final chapter</a></small></p><hr><h2><i>Chapter 6: This is War</i></h2>[[MORE]]<p><i>Previously</i></p><p><i> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIt\noccurred to me that we need to explain to your nurse about your sheets.\u201d\nSeokjin mumbled as he draped his arm over Sumin\u2019s bare waist. </i></p><p><i>Sumin gave him look, though he couldn\u2019t see\nit. </i></p><p><i> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhat\ndo you \u2018we need to explain\u2019?

The keeper of my heart. My everything.\u201d He\nwhispered sweetly before drifting off towards dreamland, where his mind could\nfinally rest and think about nothing else, but a married life with Sumin. </i></p><p><i>Except\u2026 there was something wrong with that\nplan\u2026</i></p><p><i>Who said that it would be his married life\nwith Sumin? </i></p><p>Waves\ncrashed against the cliffs. Seagulls flew high in the air as the breeze\nassisted them along the way. Nothing but the sounds of nature entered the\ncastle grounds.</p><p>Why was\nthis once beloved kingdom so quiet? What happened to the lively chatter that\nwent on between every villager? </p><p>Pending\nwar. That\u2019s what happened. </p><p>The\nonce neutral king now became ready for battle as the lives of his people were\non the line. The kind mask he wore on his face now was a face of anger and\nstress. </p><p>Princess\nSumin worried for him as did his wife. Their enemies must\u2019ve known about his\ndepleting health, and that was why there were attacking. </p><p>After a\nyear of silence and being left alone, what triggered them? What angered these\nprideful kings to the point of rejecting every offer for peace?</p><p>Unfortunately,\nthe answers that formulated in the royal family\u2019s minds were all wrong. It\nwasn\u2019t a matter of what, but who. </p><p>To be\nmore precise, it was all because of King Ji Yong\u2014and Sumin and her family had\nno idea.</p><p>Except\u2026</p><p>Maybe\nfor Kim Seokjin.</p><p>Something\nabout that deceitful king never sat right with him\u2014especially since Ji Yong had\nhis eyes on Princess Sumin. <i>His </i>princess.\n</p><p>Sumin.</p><p>Everyone\u2019s\nprized jewel. </p><p>Too bad\nfor Ji Yong that she fell in love with Seokjin. Now, they were engaged to be\nmarried. Sumin proudly wore his ring around her neck on a rose gold chain as\nthey both agreed that they should keep it hidden until after the war. </p><p>Something\nabout this war screamed planned\u2014intentional. </p><p>After\nnews about Sumin\u2019s betrothal to her knight spread to the other kingdoms, an\nextreme amount of tension filled the air. Even a tiny glare could easily start\na bloody war. </p><p>Right\nnow, Seokjin stood by Sumin\u2019s father side and continued to discuss plans for\nthe upcoming battle. </p><p>While\nwith Sumin, she continued to receive letters from Ji Yong, and there were\nalways accompanied with a single red rose. </p><p>Her\neyes scanned the parchment tainted with ink as rolled her eyes for the nth time\nthat afternoon. She felt the urge to vomit as Ji Yong\u2019s \u201cfriendly\u201d words always\nseemed to cross unspeakable boundaries. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cNurse!\u201d She cried out, crumpling up\nthe paper. </p><p>Seconds\nlater, her nurse arrived a bit out of breath. The elderly woman bowed her head\nin respect, much to Sumin\u2019s dismay. She had always told the poor woman that\nthere was no need for formalities since she was like her second mother. While\nher mother ran the kingdom alongside her father, the nurse cared and loved for\nSumin as if she was her own. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYes, princess?\u201d The nurse answered,\nignoring Sumin\u2019s pointless protests. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cFirst, can you please stop bowing\nyour head to me. It is quite odd. Second, please burn this note,\u201d She handed\nover the note to the nurse, \u201cIt is from Ji Yong yet again.\u201d She said, rubbing\nthe sides of her forehead. </p><p>The\nnurse felt nothing but pity towards her princess. Ever since that awful king\nreturned to his kingdom, he had yet to cease with his advances. In fact, they\nbecame frequent once the news of Sumin\u2019s engagement reached him. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cDoes Seokjin know about these\nletters?\u201d asked the Nurse as she folded up the letter and tucked it away in the\npocket of her skirt. </p><p>Sumin\u2019s\nbreath hitched. Her heart stopped for a split second. A nervous expression\nappeared on her face as she tried to figure out how to politely tell her dear\nfriend the truth. </p><p>However,\nthe nurse took her lack of speech as a no. Then, she gave the young princess a\nlook.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhy have you not told your knight\nabout these letters? I am almost certain that if he did indeed know about these\nappalling words from King Ji Yong, Seokjin would put in an immediate stop to\nthem.\u201d The nurse said, reasoning with the secretly scared princess. </p><p>Sumin\nsighed deeply, \u201cBecause, I have heard talks of him acting as a general for our\narmy. Fighting in my father\u2019s place,\u201d She paused; a look of utter concern\nglazed over her eyes, \u201cI do not want to trouble him with such tiny problems.\u201d\nShe finished.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOh, hush child. He is to be your\nfuture-husband. It is his job to know and take care of your problems as it is\nyour job to take care of his as well.\u201d The nurse retorted, waving off her\nexcuses. </p><p>Sumin\ngawked. Throughout her years of living, never once has she heard her dear nurse\nuse such a tone. Sumin honestly thought that her nurse was capable of such a\nthing. Most of the time, the nurse\u2019s tone was always lighthearted and quite\nplayful. Sometimes, she would use a stern tone, but only to discipline the\nprincess when she was a child. Now? This was an entirely different tone\u2014and\nthat impressed Sumin just a tiny bit.</p><p> As Sumin opened her mouth to give compliments\nto her second mother, a light knock echoed throughout her chambers.</p><p>A look\nof confusion washed over face as both Sumin and the nursed eyed each other,\nwondering what or who could that be. </p><p>Sumin\nknew that it could not have been her knight since he had sent a message telling\nher that he would be with her father all day. </p><p>Not\nwasting another moment, Sumin instructed the nurse to answer the door and\nwaited patiently for the so-called intruder to enter her line of sight. </p><p>Suddenly,\na short gasp escaped her lips followed by a squeal of delight. She bundled up\nher skirt and ran full-force into the person\u2019s arms. </p><p>A\nbright smile painted her lips as she breathed in the person\u2019s musky scent. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou know\u2026if I had known that this\nwould be the sort of welcome I would be privileged to, then I would have left\nyour father\u2019s side a long time ago.\u201d Teased a familiar voice. </p><p>Sumin\nglanced up; love and happiness sparkled in her eyes. She had longed for his\npresence ever since there had been hints of war that lingered in the air. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOh, hush. You know you missed me as\nmuch as I had missed you, Seokjin.\u201d Sumin teased back, smirking playfully. </p><p>Seokjin\nnodded as he could not argue with his smart princess. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI believe that I had missed a tad bit\nmore than you, but I will allow you to believe that we have longed for each\nother equally.\u201d He said jokingly. </p><p>Sumin\nreleased him from her hold and took a step back. A tiny pout replaced the bright\nsmile that graced her lips. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou are unbelievable Sir Seokjin,\u201d\nShe crossed her arms over her chest, \u201cI believe I have tolerated your presence\nlong enough. Now, leave my sight.\u201d She demanded coldly, fighting the urge to\nsmile. </p><p>Seokjin\nraised his brow, deciding if he wanted to call her bluff or do as he was told.\nAfter quickly debating, he chose the latter. He always loved to hear Sumin beg\nfor him. Just thinking about all the times, she had begged for him, sent a\nsudden wave of euphoria crashing down on his body. Why? It was always during\ntheir lovemaking sessions. She had begged for him to go faster, rougher. She even\ndesired to scream his name while he sent wave after wave of pleasure throughout\nher body. </p><p>God,\nremembering how loud her moans had gotten while he was practically pounding her\npretty little pussy caused his dick to harden. </p><p>Out of\nall the times to become aroused, he had to pick a time where Sumin didn\u2019t seem\nlike in the mood. </p><p>The\njoys of being an adult male and in love with the prettiest woman on Earth. </p><p>The\nHoly Father had to hate him for not only having sex before their wedding but\nalso having these recurring naughty thoughts while a war was about to happen. </p><p>Sumin,\non the other hand, noticed the odd expression that appeared on her fianc\u00e9\u2019s\nface. A familiar emotion glazed over his eyes while his lips parted a tiny bit.\nHis breathing grew rapid, and his heart pounded against his chest. </p><p>Sumin\nfelt the urge to take a step back as she suddenly felt vulnerable. She glanced\nat her nurse and subtly dismissed her as she did not want an audience for what\nwas bound to happen next. </p><p>The\nnurse fought the urge to laugh as she shook her head and swiftly left the\nprincess\u2019s chambers. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThose children, I swear\u2026Sumin is\nbound to be with child if she and Seokjin do not lessen their lovemaking.\u201d She\nthought with an amusing smile. </p><p>Now\nalone in her chambers, Seokjin immediately captured her lips; his hands\ntenderly cupped her cheeks. His lips pressed firmly against hers as he slowly\nguided her to the bed and then gently laid her down, careful not to\naccidentally squish his lover. </p><p>Their\neyes bore into each other\u2019s; an intense amount of love that was unspoken\nbetween them. Whenever the childhood lovers were together, they rarely\nconfessed their love because it was never needed. Their hearts and minds knew\nhow the other felt, so\u2014 it was rarely said.</p><p>An\naspect of their bond that both Sumin and Seokjin loved and cherished. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou know\u2026I will never tire of\nseeing this sight,\u201d He pressed a light kiss on her nose, \u201cYou underneath me,\u201d\nHis hands trailed down the sides of her body, \u201cYour addicting lips slightly\nparted as my hardened member penetrates your womanhood.\u201d He finished, whispering\nseductively into her ear. </p><p>The\nwarmth in his breath, and his provocative words resulted in a soft moan to\nleave her lips. </p><p>Just\nhis mere words were enough to arouse Sumin. He had no need to touch her, and\nthat made Seokjin to swell up with pride. He just loved having this unexplainable\ncontrol over his princess and vice versa. Sumin had Seokjin like putty in her\nhands, and he was perfectly fine with that since it sometimes resulted in some\nnew and exciting adventures. </p><p>Speaking\nof which\u2026</p><p>A tiny\nsmirk slowly graced her face as a rather interesting idea popped into her mind.\nShe lightly pushed against Seokjin\u2019s chest, signaling that she wanted to sit\nup. Seokjin stared at her with nothing but confusion etched on his face as\ncreated enough space between them. Though, he already missed the closeness\nbetween them. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cAre you no longer in the mood,\nsweetheart?\u201d asked Seokjin.</p><p>Sumin\nlaughed softly, \u201cOh, there is no doubt in my mind that I want the two of us to\nengage in passionate lovemaking, but\u2026\u201d She trailed on, trying to figure out how\nto word what was on her mind. </p><p>Seokjin\nurged her to continue, finding the unexpected anticipation to be nerve\nwrecking.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cBut\u2026I am quite tired of being\nunderneath you, my love,\u201d She boldly pushed him down; his back now against her\nmattress, \u201cI believe that it is your turn to submit to me.\u201d She whispered\nseductively as her hands reached behind her and untied the strings to her\ndress. </p><p>Seokjin\nwatched eagerly as her breasts became slightly exposed due to her corset loosening\nup. His lips slightly ajar as he desperately wanted to attack the soft tissues\nof her skin with his lips. He desired to mark up her pretty neck as her hands\nclutched his hair, tugging it softly as she wanted more skin-on-skin contact. </p><p>Unfortunately,\nSumin positioned herself in a way that restrained his body enough so that he\ncould not sit up. She wanted him to simply relax and let her do all the work. An\naction that was considered a rarity in a princess, so Seokjin was in for a real\ntreat. </p><p>His lip\nslowly swept the bottom of his lip as Seokjin clenched and unclenched his\nfists. The restraints were killing him, and he wasn\u2019t even tied up. Seokjin\nblamed her archery teacher for building her upper body strength, and her\nhorseback riding teacher for allowing to build up her leg muscles. </p><p>As if she\nwasn\u2019t strong already\u2026Seokjin had traumatic flashbacks to when their mere\nchildren, and she always pinned him down onto the ground. </p><p>Damn\nwoman\u2026</p><p>With\nher torso completely exposed, Sumin brushed her fingers through her luscious\nlocks. Her semi-wavy hair cascaded down her face as she stared intensely at\nSeokjin. She lightly caressed her body, sending tiny jolts of electricity\nthroughout her. Her erect nipples ached to be touched by her lover\u2019s hands and\nmouth. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cS-Sumin\u2026please free my arms.\u201d Sumin\nheard Seokjin beg; the need to touch her delicate body became unbearable. </p><p>Sumin\npeeked down; a playful yet enticing smirk decorated her face. She raised her\nbrow before tapping her chin as she thought about his request.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cAnd why would I do that my beloved\nknight?\u201d asked Sumin, maintaining the sexy smirk. </p><p>A deep\ngroan developed in the back of his throat. Sumin was really pushing his\nbuttons, and it wasn\u2019t even nighttime yet. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cBecause, I know how much you\nlove\u2026how much you crave my touch, so please do us both a favor and free me.\u201d\nSeokjin calmly answered, stating the obvious. </p><p>Sumin\nhummed in response. Seokjin always tend to make incredibly good points,\nhowever, she had to remain strong and in control. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThat may be true, however, I want\nyou to know what it is like to be in my position,\u201d Her hands untucked the\ncotton shirt from his pants, \u201cI want you to feel the burning sensation that you\nmanaged to always leave on my body,\u201d She gently caressed his torso, feeling the\nhis six-pack in the process, \u201cI simply want you to enjoy what I have to give\nyou my dear knight.\u201d She finished softly before nipping his earlobe and pulling\naway. </p><p>Seokjin\ncouldn\u2019t help but growl lowly as this was pure torture. If she wanted to know\nwhat she felt like, she could\u2019ve just told him. He started to become a horrible\ninfluence on his not-so-innocent princess. </p><p>As he\nopened his mouth to argue\u2014even beg to at least let him rest his hands on her\nbare waist\u2014Sumin unbuttoned his pants and trailed her fingers down his holy\nv-line. </p><p>Seokjin\nsighed deeply as he felt her fingers wrap around his hardened length. The\nwarmth from her hands created this remarkable sensation that he couldn\u2019t help\nbut buckle his hips, thrusting himself into her hands.</p><p>Her\nhand began to rub up and down, pumping his dick, as her free hand disappeared\nunderneath her skirt and played with her clit. </p><p>Her\nthumb and index finger matched the pace of her other hand, leaving both her and\nSeokjin a moaning mess. </p><p>Their\nmoans gradually grew louder and louder as the urge to climax increased. </p><p>Sumin\nleaned backwards a little, allowing enough room for her to fully release\nSeokjin\u2019s dick from his pants. She then repositioned herself, letting just the\ntip to touch her soaking wet core.</p><p>Feeling\nhow insanely wet she was made Seokjin want to flip their positions and take her\nat once. He wanted to pound her cute little cunt until her moans practically\nbecame screams as he pinned her hands above her head. Her beautiful breasts\npushed against his naked torso as he rested his forehead against, filling her\nears with profanities and grunts. </p><p>However,\nhe decided to indulge his princess and let her be in complete and utter\ncontrol. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThis is new angle for you, my\ndarling. Take it nice and slow. Understand?\u201d Seokjin kindly advised,\nencouraging his future-wife as he sensed a bit of nervousness from her. </p><p>Hearing\nhis words of encouragement filled her heart with joy and sent a jolt of\nconfidence through her veins. Sumin took this newly found confidence and\nallowed it to fuel her. </p><p>She\nslowly lowered herself onto him; tiny gasps escaped her plump lips as she did. </p><p>Seokjin\ntried to control his breathing, however, it was proven quite difficult as he\nfelt both the warmth and wetness that came from Sumin. He was amazed with how\ntight she managed to feel. Yet, they had shared plenty of intimate moments. </p><p>The\nwonderful world of a woman\u2019s body\u2026</p><p>A\nconcept that Seokjin would simply enjoy and stop questioning. </p><p>He\nwatched with anticipation as he patiently waited for Sumin to adjust to the new\nangle and his size. He gently caressed her soft skin, muttering soothing and\nloving words. </p><p>Suddenly,\nhe felt Sumin\u2019s hand firmly placed on his chest, anchoring herself against him.\nThen, she lightly rocked herself; her hips lifted up just a bit before lowering\ndown. She repeated the action, gradually picking her pace as she arched her\nback and allowed the pleasurable sensation to take control.</p><p>The\nlust clouded both their minds. The love filled their hearts.</p><p>Both\nmoans and grunts echoed throughout her chambers as Sumin\u2019s rocking slowly\nbecame sloppy. </p><p>Her\ninner walls constricted around Seokjin; an action that signified that Sumin was\nclose to releasing. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cShit\u2026Sumin\u2026\u201d Seokjin grunted out,\nlosing his train of thought. </p><p>Luckily\nfor him, Sumin knew him well. She knew that he wanted them to climax together.\nHe wanted her sweet juices mixing with his. </p><p>She\nuttered a quick, \u201cI know.\u201d, before quickening her pace and rubbing her clit\nvigorously, intensifying the wave of pleasure that she experienced. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cS-Seokjin\u2026I am g-going to\u2026\u201d Sumin\nwhimpered, feeling Seokjin\u2019s fingers dig into her skin. </p><p>Seokjin\ngrunted in response as he thrusted upwards, meeting her halfway. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI know, my princess\u2026I am almost\nthere too\u2026\u201d He mustered out; he too felt the urge to climax draw near. </p><p>With a\nfew sloppier rocking hip motions and thrusts, the princess and her knight saw a\nblanket of white. </p><p>Sumin\ncollapsed on top of Seokjin; her sweaty forehead rested against his sweaty\nshoulder. </p><p>Seokjin\nsoftly rubbed her back as he caught his breath and calmed his racing heart.</p><p>A few\nairy chuckles left his lips as Seokjin wrapped his muddled mind around the fact\nthat he found a new found favorite position. </p><p>He\nshould allow Sumin to be on top more often. He had full view of Sumin\u2019s\nbreasts, and her face contorted in pleasure. </p><p>What a\nmemorable sight\u2026</p><p>Seokjin\nwould remember it for the rest of his life. </p><p>After\ngathering enough strength, Sumin rolled off Seokjin and laid beside him,\nresting her head on his chest. </p><p>Seokjin\nwrapped his arm around her, pulling her even closer even though it was not\nremotely even possible. They were as close as can be. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI cannot believe that we had spent\nmost of the afternoon doing this\u2026\u201d He stated, chuckling. </p><p>Sumin\ngiggled softly, \u201cI know my sweet knight. I believe that we have made a new\nrecord.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI think we came quite close to be\nquite frank.\u201d Seokjin said, smiling warmly at her. </p><p>As\nSumin opened her mouth to speak, the lovers heard a light knock on the door. </p><p>Sumin\u2019s\neyes bulged as she quickly pulled the covers over her chest while Seokjin\nsnickered at her frantic behavior.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOh, my goodness. Sumin, I am almost\npositive that the castle workers know about our intimacy, so there is honestly\nno reason to hide it.\u201d He pointed out, earning him a smack and glare from\nSumin. </p><p>She\nthen shouted a quick, \u201center\u201d, before grabbing Seokjin\u2019s hands to prevent him\nfondling her under the sheets. </p><p>Moments\nlater, an out of breath castle servant came running in. The couple eyed the\nservant with curiosity. Why was he so tired? Did he honestly run all the way to\nher chambers? </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cSir Seokjin. Your highness. Your\nparents would like to request your presence for supper this evening.\u201d Announced\nthe royal messenger as he bowed his head in respect; though, he had been\ncareful to not lock gazes with them. </p><p>Sumin\nsmiled politely and acknowledged the message. She then instructed the messenger\nto tell her parents that she and Seokjin should be down shortly. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYes, milady. Excuse me.\u201d The royal\nmessenger bowed once more before quickly excusing himself from their sight. </p><p>Once\nthey heard the door shut, tiny snickers filled the room as the royal couple\ncould not help but feel pity towards the poor man. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cLet us not keep your mother and\nfather waiting much longer, princess.\u201d Seokjin suggested, pushing off the\ncovers and leaving the bed. He then bent down and picked up his discarded\nshirt. </p><p>Sumin\neyed his ass; an alluring smile painted on her lips. Her hormones were slowly\nworked up again, and Seokjin knew his princess all too well. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cStop eyeing me like how our horses\neye their carrots and get changed, Sumin.\u201d Seokjin instructed, securing his\nbelt around his pants. He wanted to look presentable since he was meeting his\nfuture-in-laws. </p><p>Sumin\npouted as she shuffled out of bed. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWow\u2026I cannot believe you called me\nby my actual name. You normally call me a pet name.\u201d She said, walking over to\nher wardrobe and scanning her many dresses. </p><p>Seokjin\nrolled his eyes, \u201cI do, but we need to hurry. I would fancy not having yet\nanother talk of when you are going to be with child.\u201d </p><p>Hearing\nhis statement caused Sumin to giggle softly as she picked out a dusty\nrose-colored dress and revealed her chose to Seokjin.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhat do you think, my beloved?\u201d\nasked Sumin, wanting her fianc\u00e9\u2019s opinion.</p><p>Seokjin\nturned around and eyed her dress of choice. His eyes scanned the incredible\nfloral detail in the lace that covered the satin dust rose skirt. The sleeves\nlooked like they would go past her elbows, and the straps would rest perfectly\non her shoulders. That tiny exposure was enough to rile him up yet still\nmaintained that sense of modesty. His fianc\u00e9e had wonderful taste in dresses.\nNow, if only she\u2019d fancy wearing them a lot more, then he would die a happy\nman. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIt is quite beautiful, my\nprincess.\u201d He confessed, smiling warmly. </p><p>Sumin\ngrinned brightly before disappearing to change into her dinner attire. Seconds\nlater, she resurfaced struggling to tie her dress. Sheesh, she could tie her\nsash, but she could not tie the strings that kept her corset nice and tight.\nThe last thing she needed was to reveal all the love marks that were <i>finally </i>fading. </p><p>Seokjin\nnoticed her struggles and cocked up his brow; an amused smirk graced his face. </p><p>He\ncalmly walked over to Sumin and offered his services. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cNo, I can do it!\u201d She refused,\nstill struggling. </p><p>Seokjin\ngave her look and asked if she was sure. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOh! Just help me, please!\u201d Sumin\npractically begged, growing annoyed with the fact that she needed help. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhy is that you dislike asking me\nfor help yet allow your lovely nurse to assist you with no problem?\u201d asked\nSeokjin as he quickly laced her corset and tightened the strings. </p><p>Sumin\nhuffed, \u201cThat is because that I have no choice but to allow her to assist me.\nYou know how stubborn that nanny can be.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhatever you say, sweetheart. You\njust do not like the idea of me helping you.\u201d Seokjin argued before placing a\nsweet kiss on her temple. </p><p>Sumin\nignored his comments and asked him if they could go down for supper, walking\ntowards the door and leaving behind Seokjin. </p><p>Seokjin\nwatched her retreating body create more space between them. Without a second\nthought, he rushed after. He shouted at her, demanding her to slow down and\nwait for him, but Sumin ignored him. </p><p>Here was\nher infamous \u201cplay hard to get\u201d mood\u2026</p><p>One\nwould think that Seokjin would have been used to this since she had always been\nlike that ever since they were children. However, it annoyed him back then, and\nit annoyed him now. </p><p>One of\nthe many moments where he questioned why he fell in love with this entertaining\nwoman. At least one thing was for certain, he would never grow bored of the\nsame old thing. </p><p>With\nthe dining hall in sight, Sumin peered over her shoulder and playfully winked\nat her frustrated knight. She quickly mouthed, \u201cI love you.\u201d, to him before\nmaking her presence known to her parents. </p><p>She\nhappily kissed her parents\u2019 cheeks and asked them how they were doing this fine\nevening as she took her usual seat\u2014right across from her mother and next to her\nfather, on his right side. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIt is always a delight to see your\nsmiling face, my treasured jewel.\u201d Sumin heard her father say. Hints of\ntiredness laced his voice. </p><p>Sumin\nremained smiling, wanting to the strength that both her parents desperately\nneeded during a time like this. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWell, you, mother, and Seokjin are\nmy reasons for smiling, so I am always quite happy.\u201d Sumin stated as she picked\nup her fork. </p><p>Sumin\u2019s\nfather nodded slowly; his eyes drooped a little bit. </p><p>Sumin\u2019s\nmother took noticed and nudged him slightly. Her heart ached for her ailing\nhusband. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cTell me daughter, how are yours and\nSeokjin\u2019s wedding preparation coming along? Do let me or your father know if\nthere is anything that you need.\u201d Sumin\u2019s mother inquired, fighting the urge to\nexcuse both her and her husband from the dinner table to rest in their\nchambers. </p><p>Sumin finished\nchewing the luxurious cut of meat and quickly patted her mouth with the napkin.\n</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cUm\u2026well\u2026the wedding preparations\nare currently on hold.\u201d She shyly admitted, glancing at Seokjin, who was\nequally as nervous. </p><p>Both\nher mother and father eyed with both confusion and curiosity. They had thought that\ntheir daughter and her fianc\u00e9 were close to being done. Now, they were hearing\nthat their wedding plans had been put on hold. Was it because of the war? </p><p>Sumin\u2019s\nfather gestured for Seokjin to come to the table which Seokjin obeyed. He left\nhis post and walked up to the royal family.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYes, your majesty.\u201d He greeted,\nbowing his head in respect. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cMay I ask why you and my daughter\npostponing the wedding?\u201d The king asked as he lifted his water goblet. </p><p>Seokjin\nnoted how shaky the king\u2019s hand was when he lifted the goblet. Poor Sumin. Her\nheart would be devastated once her father passes away. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cSumin and I discussed both the\nadvantages and disadvantages of having our wedding while there is talk of war,\nand we have concluded that it would be wise to wait until this over.\u201d Seokjin\nanswered, averting his gaze away from the king\u2019s. </p><p>The\nking rubbed his chin and directed his attention towards his daughter. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIs this true, Sumin?\u201d asked the\nKing, letting out a tiny painful groan. </p><p>Sumin\neyed her father with worried eyes; her heart honestly broke to see her father\nin such excruciating pain. She wanted nothing more to find a cure for whatever\nthat hurt her father. </p><p>Before\nshe could get carried away with her thoughts, her father called out to her,\nwondering why his daughter is unusually silent. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cMy deepest apologies, father. I am\nsimply worried about you and failing health is all.\u201d She said, smiling sadly. </p><p>Her\nfather fought the tears that slowly pooled in his eyes. He never once liked\nlooking frail in front of his family but lately, his body was not getting the\nmessage. He saw bits and pieces of his life flashing before his eyes. It was if\nthe Holy father was telling him that his time was ending. </p><p>He\nslowly reached over and gently grasped his daughter\u2019s hand. He smiled warmly at\nher as he rested her hand on his cheek, feeling the warmth radiate from it. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cPlease do not worry about your old\nman, my darling daughter. I will continue to fight whatever it is that riddles\nmy body, and I want you to smile more and worry less about your mother and I,\u201d\nHe then held his wife\u2019s hand, \u201cWe may be old, but we still have some fight left\nin us.\u201d He stated firmly with a determined smirk. </p><p>Sumin\nsimply nodded, not being able to find the next set of words. </p><p>Sumin\u2019s\nfather patted her on the bed and then excused himself from the table. It was\ntime for him and his wife to get plenty of rest. They had a long day ahead of\nthem tomorrow. </p><p>Sumin\nsaid goodnight to her parents and waited for them to leave the room before\nasking Seokjin if he wanted to take a walk with her. She desperately needed\nfresh air to clear her mind and erase the horrible sight that she was forced to\nwitness. </p><p>Small\ntears trickled down her face as short sniffles filled the dining hall, alerting\nthe castle staff. </p><p>They\ngrew unsure on what they should do next. Should they alert her parents? Should\nthey fetch her nanny? They hated seeing their beloved princess cry. </p><p>Luckily,\nthey didn\u2019t have to witness it much longer. Seokjin gently helped her up and\nwiped the tears away before it dropped to the floor. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIt will be alright, darling,\u201d\nSeokjin pecked her forehead, \u201cThe king and queen will be fine. They just need a\ngood night\u2019s rest is all.\u201d He said softly, soothing her worries away. </p><p>Sumin sniffled,\ntrying her hardest to stop the tears but ultimately failing. She then pressed\nher face to Seokjin\u2019s chest, soaking his cotton shirt. Her sobs became\nuncontrollable. No words left her lips. Just choked out cries. </p><p>Seokjin\nrested his cheek on top of her head and gently rubbed her back. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cCome, my love. Let us take a walk\nin the garden. I know there is something else bothering you.\u201d He suggested,\nslowly escorting the two of them out of the castle walls. </p><p>The\ncool breeze greeted the lovers first followed by the soothing smell of the\nsalty waves. The crescent moon barely peeped through the trees as it tried its\nhardest to illuminate the garden. Luckily, the glorious moon had the help from\nmany stars that twinkled high in the sky. </p><p>Seeing\nthe moon and starts, even maybe a few planets that decided to grace the world,\nalways brought a sense of tranquility within Sumin. She closed her eyes and\ndrank in the calming atmosphere that appeared before them. </p><p>Silence\nfilled the space between them, however, it was a comfortable silence. Seokjin\nknew what Sumin was about to say and vice versa. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cAre you worried about me fighting\nin this war?\u201d asked Seokjin, lacing his fingers with hers. </p><p>Sumin\nsqueezed his hand and replied, \u201cI am not worried. I am afraid.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhy are you afraid, sweetheart?\u201d\nSeokjin questioned. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI am afraid that you will not come\nback to me. I cannot bear the thought of losing both you and my father. You two\nare the most important men in my life. How can I go on living on this Earth\nwhere the two of you are not here?\u201d Sumin confessed her innermost concerns. Her\nheart pounded against the chest. The oxygen slowly left her lungs as she felt\nthis weird and tight feeling in the pit of her stomach. </p><p>Seokjin\nheard Sumin\u2019s sporadic breathing and pulled her into a loving embrace. He\nrested his chin on top of her head and uttered words of love and comfort. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI do not want to marry that horrid\nKing Ji Yong. I will not!\u201d Sumin declared, alerting Seokjin.</p><p>Upon\nhearing his name, Seokjin\u2019s body immediately tensed, and a sudden wave of fury\nengulfed his body. That evil king would not leave his princess alone, and\nSeokjin had grown tired of him. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cSumin, what are you talking about?\u201d\nSeokjin inquired, glancing down at her. </p><p>Sumin\nremained silent, unsure if she should finally tell him the truth. </p><p>After\nquickly debating, Sumin opened her mouth and said,</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIt is King Ji Yong\u2026 he\u2026\u201d</p><hr><p><small><b>A/N: </b>Oh my goodness! We are nearing the end of my favorite story that I had ever written to date. I honestly feel like that the love I bear for Seokjin shows in my mind, and I wouldn\u2019t have it any other way! He deserves nothing but the best!

In that kingdom, the royal family had the freedom of marrying whoever his or her royal highness deems worthy. Now, of course, having that special privilege came with some interesting challenges, but that doesn&rsquo;t stop a certain head-strong princess from doing whatever her heart&rsquo;s desire, especially when she has her heart set on marrying her personal bodyguard. Unfortunately, her beliefs might face some hardships when a certain king sets his eye on her. Will her bodyguard continue to fight for her or is it finally her turn?</small></p><p><small>&#8251; <b>Previously: </b><a href=\"http://jinniesbby.tumblr.com/post/175791445214/fight-for-me-ch1\">ch.1</a>&nbsp;| <a href=\"http://jinniesbby.tumblr.com/post/175887448405/fight-for-me-ch2\">ch.2</a> | <a href=\"http://jinniesbby.tumblr.com/post/175993838175/fight-for-me-ch3\">ch.3</a> | <a href=\"http://jinniesbby.tumblr.com/post/176061680692/fight-for-me-ch4\">ch.4</a> | <a href=\"http://jinniesbby.tumblr.com/post/176129746496/fight-for-me-ch5\">ch.5</a><br /></small></p><p><small>&#8251; <b>Next Time:</b> <a href=\"http://jinniesbby.tumblr.com/post/176307635761/fight-for-me-final-chapter\">final chapter</a></small></p><hr /><h2><i>Chapter 6: This is War</i></h2><p><i>Previously</i></p><p><i> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;It\noccurred to me that we need to explain to your nurse about your sheets.&rdquo;\nSeokjin mumbled as he draped his arm over Sumin&rsquo;s bare waist. </i></p><p><i>Sumin gave him look, though he couldn&rsquo;t see\nit. </i></p><p><i> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;What\ndo you &lsquo;we need to explain&rsquo;?

The keeper of my heart. My everything.&rdquo; He\nwhispered sweetly before drifting off towards dreamland, where his mind could\nfinally rest and think about nothing else, but a married life with Sumin. </i></p><p><i>Except&hellip; there was something wrong with that\nplan&hellip;</i></p><p><i>Who said that it would be his married life\nwith Sumin? </i></p><p>Waves\ncrashed against the cliffs. Seagulls flew high in the air as the breeze\nassisted them along the way. Nothing but the sounds of nature entered the\ncastle grounds.</p><p>Why was\nthis once beloved kingdom so quiet? What happened to the lively chatter that\nwent on between every villager? </p><p>Pending\nwar. That&rsquo;s what happened. </p><p>The\nonce neutral king now became ready for battle as the lives of his people were\non the line. The kind mask he wore on his face now was a face of anger and\nstress. </p><p>Princess\nSumin worried for him as did his wife. Their enemies must&rsquo;ve known about his\ndepleting health, and that was why there were attacking. </p><p>After a\nyear of silence and being left alone, what triggered them? What angered these\nprideful kings to the point of rejecting every offer for peace?</p><p>Unfortunately,\nthe answers that formulated in the royal family&rsquo;s minds were all wrong. It\nwasn&rsquo;t a matter of what, but who. </p><p>To be\nmore precise, it was all because of King Ji Yong&mdash;and Sumin and her family had\nno idea.</p><p>Except&hellip;</p><p>Maybe\nfor Kim Seokjin.</p><p>Something\nabout that deceitful king never sat right with him&mdash;especially since Ji Yong had\nhis eyes on Princess Sumin. <i>His </i>princess.\n</p><p>Sumin.</p><p>Everyone&rsquo;s\nprized jewel. </p><p>Too bad\nfor Ji Yong that she fell in love with Seokjin. Now, they were engaged to be\nmarried. Sumin proudly wore his ring around her neck on a rose gold chain as\nthey both agreed that they should keep it hidden until after the war. </p><p>Something\nabout this war screamed planned&mdash;intentional. </p><p>After\nnews about Sumin&rsquo;s betrothal to her knight spread to the other kingdoms, an\nextreme amount of tension filled the air. Even a tiny glare could easily start\na bloody war. </p><p>Right\nnow, Seokjin stood by Sumin&rsquo;s father side and continued to discuss plans for\nthe upcoming battle. </p><p>While\nwith Sumin, she continued to receive letters from Ji Yong, and there were\nalways accompanied with a single red rose. </p><p>Her\neyes scanned the parchment tainted with ink as rolled her eyes for the nth time\nthat afternoon. She felt the urge to vomit as Ji Yong&rsquo;s &ldquo;friendly&rdquo; words always\nseemed to cross unspeakable boundaries. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Nurse!&rdquo; She cried out, crumpling up\nthe paper. </p><p>Seconds\nlater, her nurse arrived a bit out of breath. The elderly woman bowed her head\nin respect, much to Sumin&rsquo;s dismay. She had always told the poor woman that\nthere was no need for formalities since she was like her second mother. While\nher mother ran the kingdom alongside her father, the nurse cared and loved for\nSumin as if she was her own. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Yes, princess?&rdquo; The nurse answered,\nignoring Sumin&rsquo;s pointless protests. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;First, can you please stop bowing\nyour head to me. It is quite odd. Second, please burn this note,&rdquo; She handed\nover the note to the nurse, &ldquo;It is from Ji Yong yet again.&rdquo; She said, rubbing\nthe sides of her forehead. </p><p>The\nnurse felt nothing but pity towards her princess. Ever since that awful king\nreturned to his kingdom, he had yet to cease with his advances. In fact, they\nbecame frequent once the news of Sumin&rsquo;s engagement reached him. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Does Seokjin know about these\nletters?&rdquo; asked the Nurse as she folded up the letter and tucked it away in the\npocket of her skirt. </p><p>Sumin&rsquo;s\nbreath hitched. Her heart stopped for a split second. A nervous expression\nappeared on her face as she tried to figure out how to politely tell her dear\nfriend the truth. </p><p>However,\nthe nurse took her lack of speech as a no. Then, she gave the young princess a\nlook.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Why have you not told your knight\nabout these letters? I am almost certain that if he did indeed know about these\nappalling words from King Ji Yong, Seokjin would put in an immediate stop to\nthem.&rdquo; The nurse said, reasoning with the secretly scared princess. </p><p>Sumin\nsighed deeply, &ldquo;Because, I have heard talks of him acting as a general for our\narmy. Fighting in my father&rsquo;s place,&rdquo; She paused; a look of utter concern\nglazed over her eyes, &ldquo;I do not want to trouble him with such tiny problems.&rdquo;\nShe finished.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Oh, hush child. He is to be your\nfuture-husband. It is his job to know and take care of your problems as it is\nyour job to take care of his as well.&rdquo; The nurse retorted, waving off her\nexcuses. </p><p>Sumin\ngawked. Throughout her years of living, never once has she heard her dear nurse\nuse such a tone. Sumin honestly thought that her nurse was capable of such a\nthing. Most of the time, the nurse&rsquo;s tone was always lighthearted and quite\nplayful. Sometimes, she would use a stern tone, but only to discipline the\nprincess when she was a child. Now? This was an entirely different tone&mdash;and\nthat impressed Sumin just a tiny bit.</p><p> As Sumin opened her mouth to give compliments\nto her second mother, a light knock echoed throughout her chambers.</p><p>A look\nof confusion washed over face as both Sumin and the nursed eyed each other,\nwondering what or who could that be. </p><p>Sumin\nknew that it could not have been her knight since he had sent a message telling\nher that he would be with her father all day. </p><p>Not\nwasting another moment, Sumin instructed the nurse to answer the door and\nwaited patiently for the so-called intruder to enter her line of sight. </p><p>Suddenly,\na short gasp escaped her lips followed by a squeal of delight. She bundled up\nher skirt and ran full-force into the person&rsquo;s arms. </p><p>A\nbright smile painted her lips as she breathed in the person&rsquo;s musky scent. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;You know&hellip;if I had known that this\nwould be the sort of welcome I would be privileged to, then I would have left\nyour father&rsquo;s side a long time ago.&rdquo; Teased a familiar voice. </p><p>Sumin\nglanced up; love and happiness sparkled in her eyes. She had longed for his\npresence ever since there had been hints of war that lingered in the air. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Oh, hush. You know you missed me as\nmuch as I had missed you, Seokjin.&rdquo; Sumin teased back, smirking playfully. </p><p>Seokjin\nnodded as he could not argue with his smart princess. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;I believe that I had missed a tad bit\nmore than you, but I will allow you to believe that we have longed for each\nother equally.&rdquo; He said jokingly. </p><p>Sumin\nreleased him from her hold and took a step back. A tiny pout replaced the bright\nsmile that graced her lips. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;You are unbelievable Sir Seokjin,&rdquo;\nShe crossed her arms over her chest, &ldquo;I believe I have tolerated your presence\nlong enough. Now, leave my sight.&rdquo; She demanded coldly, fighting the urge to\nsmile. </p><p>Seokjin\nraised his brow, deciding if he wanted to call her bluff or do as he was told.\nAfter quickly debating, he chose the latter. He always loved to hear Sumin beg\nfor him. Just thinking about all the times, she had begged for him, sent a\nsudden wave of euphoria crashing down on his body. Why? It was always during\ntheir lovemaking sessions. She had begged for him to go faster, rougher. She even\ndesired to scream his name while he sent wave after wave of pleasure throughout\nher body. </p><p>God,\nremembering how loud her moans had gotten while he was practically pounding her\npretty little pussy caused his dick to harden. </p><p>Out of\nall the times to become aroused, he had to pick a time where Sumin didn&rsquo;t seem\nlike in the mood. </p><p>The\njoys of being an adult male and in love with the prettiest woman on Earth. </p><p>The\nHoly Father had to hate him for not only having sex before their wedding but\nalso having these recurring naughty thoughts while a war was about to happen. </p><p>Sumin,\non the other hand, noticed the odd expression that appeared on her fianc&eacute;&rsquo;s\nface. A familiar emotion glazed over his eyes while his lips parted a tiny bit.\nHis breathing grew rapid, and his heart pounded against his chest. </p><p>Sumin\nfelt the urge to take a step back as she suddenly felt vulnerable. She glanced\nat her nurse and subtly dismissed her as she did not want an audience for what\nwas bound to happen next. </p><p>The\nnurse fought the urge to laugh as she shook her head and swiftly left the\nprincess&rsquo;s chambers. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Those children, I swear&hellip;Sumin is\nbound to be with child if she and Seokjin do not lessen their lovemaking.&rdquo; She\nthought with an amusing smile. </p><p>Now\nalone in her chambers, Seokjin immediately captured her lips; his hands\ntenderly cupped her cheeks. His lips pressed firmly against hers as he slowly\nguided her to the bed and then gently laid her down, careful not to\naccidentally squish his lover. </p><p>Their\neyes bore into each other&rsquo;s; an intense amount of love that was unspoken\nbetween them. Whenever the childhood lovers were together, they rarely\nconfessed their love because it was never needed. Their hearts and minds knew\nhow the other felt, so&mdash; it was rarely said.</p><p>An\naspect of their bond that both Sumin and Seokjin loved and cherished. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;You know&hellip;I will never tire of\nseeing this sight,&rdquo; He pressed a light kiss on her nose, &ldquo;You underneath me,&rdquo;\nHis hands trailed down the sides of her body, &ldquo;Your addicting lips slightly\nparted as my hardened member penetrates your womanhood.&rdquo; He finished, whispering\nseductively into her ear. </p><p>The\nwarmth in his breath, and his provocative words resulted in a soft moan to\nleave her lips. </p><p>Just\nhis mere words were enough to arouse Sumin. He had no need to touch her, and\nthat made Seokjin to swell up with pride. He just loved having this unexplainable\ncontrol over his princess and vice versa. Sumin had Seokjin like putty in her\nhands, and he was perfectly fine with that since it sometimes resulted in some\nnew and exciting adventures. </p><p>Speaking\nof which&hellip;</p><p>A tiny\nsmirk slowly graced her face as a rather interesting idea popped into her mind.\nShe lightly pushed against Seokjin&rsquo;s chest, signaling that she wanted to sit\nup. Seokjin stared at her with nothing but confusion etched on his face as\ncreated enough space between them. Though, he already missed the closeness\nbetween them. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Are you no longer in the mood,\nsweetheart?&rdquo; asked Seokjin.</p><p>Sumin\nlaughed softly, &ldquo;Oh, there is no doubt in my mind that I want the two of us to\nengage in passionate lovemaking, but&hellip;&rdquo; She trailed on, trying to figure out how\nto word what was on her mind. </p><p>Seokjin\nurged her to continue, finding the unexpected anticipation to be nerve\nwrecking.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;But&hellip;I am quite tired of being\nunderneath you, my love,&rdquo; She boldly pushed him down; his back now against her\nmattress, &ldquo;I believe that it is your turn to submit to me.&rdquo; She whispered\nseductively as her hands reached behind her and untied the strings to her\ndress. </p><p>Seokjin\nwatched eagerly as her breasts became slightly exposed due to her corset loosening\nup. His lips slightly ajar as he desperately wanted to attack the soft tissues\nof her skin with his lips. He desired to mark up her pretty neck as her hands\nclutched his hair, tugging it softly as she wanted more skin-on-skin contact. </p><p>Unfortunately,\nSumin positioned herself in a way that restrained his body enough so that he\ncould not sit up. She wanted him to simply relax and let her do all the work. An\naction that was considered a rarity in a princess, so Seokjin was in for a real\ntreat. </p><p>His lip\nslowly swept the bottom of his lip as Seokjin clenched and unclenched his\nfists. The restraints were killing him, and he wasn&rsquo;t even tied up. Seokjin\nblamed her archery teacher for building her upper body strength, and her\nhorseback riding teacher for allowing to build up her leg muscles. </p><p>As if she\nwasn&rsquo;t strong already&hellip;Seokjin had traumatic flashbacks to when their mere\nchildren, and she always pinned him down onto the ground. </p><p>Damn\nwoman&hellip;</p><p>With\nher torso completely exposed, Sumin brushed her fingers through her luscious\nlocks. Her semi-wavy hair cascaded down her face as she stared intensely at\nSeokjin. She lightly caressed her body, sending tiny jolts of electricity\nthroughout her. Her erect nipples ached to be touched by her lover&rsquo;s hands and\nmouth. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;S-Sumin&hellip;please free my arms.&rdquo; Sumin\nheard Seokjin beg; the need to touch her delicate body became unbearable. </p><p>Sumin\npeeked down; a playful yet enticing smirk decorated her face. She raised her\nbrow before tapping her chin as she thought about his request.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;And why would I do that my beloved\nknight?&rdquo; asked Sumin, maintaining the sexy smirk. </p><p>A deep\ngroan developed in the back of his throat. Sumin was really pushing his\nbuttons, and it wasn&rsquo;t even nighttime yet. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Because, I know how much you\nlove&hellip;how much you crave my touch, so please do us both a favor and free me.&rdquo;\nSeokjin calmly answered, stating the obvious. </p><p>Sumin\nhummed in response. Seokjin always tend to make incredibly good points,\nhowever, she had to remain strong and in control. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;That may be true, however, I want\nyou to know what it is like to be in my position,&rdquo; Her hands untucked the\ncotton shirt from his pants, &ldquo;I want you to feel the burning sensation that you\nmanaged to always leave on my body,&rdquo; She gently caressed his torso, feeling the\nhis six-pack in the process, &ldquo;I simply want you to enjoy what I have to give\nyou my dear knight.&rdquo; She finished softly before nipping his earlobe and pulling\naway. </p><p>Seokjin\ncouldn&rsquo;t help but growl lowly as this was pure torture. If she wanted to know\nwhat she felt like, she could&rsquo;ve just told him. He started to become a horrible\ninfluence on his not-so-innocent princess. </p><p>As he\nopened his mouth to argue&mdash;even beg to at least let him rest his hands on her\nbare waist&mdash;Sumin unbuttoned his pants and trailed her fingers down his holy\nv-line. </p><p>Seokjin\nsighed deeply as he felt her fingers wrap around his hardened length. The\nwarmth from her hands created this remarkable sensation that he couldn&rsquo;t help\nbut buckle his hips, thrusting himself into her hands.</p><p>Her\nhand began to rub up and down, pumping his dick, as her free hand disappeared\nunderneath her skirt and played with her clit. </p><p>Her\nthumb and index finger matched the pace of her other hand, leaving both her and\nSeokjin a moaning mess. </p><p>Their\nmoans gradually grew louder and louder as the urge to climax increased. </p><p>Sumin\nleaned backwards a little, allowing enough room for her to fully release\nSeokjin&rsquo;s dick from his pants. She then repositioned herself, letting just the\ntip to touch her soaking wet core.</p><p>Feeling\nhow insanely wet she was made Seokjin want to flip their positions and take her\nat once. He wanted to pound her cute little cunt until her moans practically\nbecame screams as he pinned her hands above her head. Her beautiful breasts\npushed against his naked torso as he rested his forehead against, filling her\nears with profanities and grunts. </p><p>However,\nhe decided to indulge his princess and let her be in complete and utter\ncontrol. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;This is new angle for you, my\ndarling. Take it nice and slow. Understand?&rdquo; Seokjin kindly advised,\nencouraging his future-wife as he sensed a bit of nervousness from her. </p><p>Hearing\nhis words of encouragement filled her heart with joy and sent a jolt of\nconfidence through her veins. Sumin took this newly found confidence and\nallowed it to fuel her. </p><p>She\nslowly lowered herself onto him; tiny gasps escaped her plump lips as she did. </p><p>Seokjin\ntried to control his breathing, however, it was proven quite difficult as he\nfelt both the warmth and wetness that came from Sumin. He was amazed with how\ntight she managed to feel. Yet, they had shared plenty of intimate moments. </p><p>The\nwonderful world of a woman&rsquo;s body&hellip;</p><p>A\nconcept that Seokjin would simply enjoy and stop questioning. </p><p>He\nwatched with anticipation as he patiently waited for Sumin to adjust to the new\nangle and his size. He gently caressed her soft skin, muttering soothing and\nloving words. </p><p>Suddenly,\nhe felt Sumin&rsquo;s hand firmly placed on his chest, anchoring herself against him.\nThen, she lightly rocked herself; her hips lifted up just a bit before lowering\ndown. She repeated the action, gradually picking her pace as she arched her\nback and allowed the pleasurable sensation to take control.</p><p>The\nlust clouded both their minds. The love filled their hearts.</p><p>Both\nmoans and grunts echoed throughout her chambers as Sumin&rsquo;s rocking slowly\nbecame sloppy. </p><p>Her\ninner walls constricted around Seokjin; an action that signified that Sumin was\nclose to releasing. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Shit&hellip;Sumin&hellip;&rdquo; Seokjin grunted out,\nlosing his train of thought. </p><p>Luckily\nfor him, Sumin knew him well. She knew that he wanted them to climax together.\nHe wanted her sweet juices mixing with his. </p><p>She\nuttered a quick, &ldquo;I know.&rdquo;, before quickening her pace and rubbing her clit\nvigorously, intensifying the wave of pleasure that she experienced. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;S-Seokjin&hellip;I am g-going to&hellip;&rdquo; Sumin\nwhimpered, feeling Seokjin&rsquo;s fingers dig into her skin. </p><p>Seokjin\ngrunted in response as he thrusted upwards, meeting her halfway. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;I know, my princess&hellip;I am almost\nthere too&hellip;&rdquo; He mustered out; he too felt the urge to climax draw near. </p><p>With a\nfew sloppier rocking hip motions and thrusts, the princess and her knight saw a\nblanket of white. </p><p>Sumin\ncollapsed on top of Seokjin; her sweaty forehead rested against his sweaty\nshoulder. </p><p>Seokjin\nsoftly rubbed her back as he caught his breath and calmed his racing heart.</p><p>A few\nairy chuckles left his lips as Seokjin wrapped his muddled mind around the fact\nthat he found a new found favorite position. </p><p>He\nshould allow Sumin to be on top more often. He had full view of Sumin&rsquo;s\nbreasts, and her face contorted in pleasure. </p><p>What a\nmemorable sight&hellip;</p><p>Seokjin\nwould remember it for the rest of his life. </p><p>After\ngathering enough strength, Sumin rolled off Seokjin and laid beside him,\nresting her head on his chest. </p><p>Seokjin\nwrapped his arm around her, pulling her even closer even though it was not\nremotely even possible. They were as close as can be. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;I cannot believe that we had spent\nmost of the afternoon doing this&hellip;&rdquo; He stated, chuckling. </p><p>Sumin\ngiggled softly, &ldquo;I know my sweet knight. I believe that we have made a new\nrecord.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;I think we came quite close to be\nquite frank.&rdquo; Seokjin said, smiling warmly at her. </p><p>As\nSumin opened her mouth to speak, the lovers heard a light knock on the door. </p><p>Sumin&rsquo;s\neyes bulged as she quickly pulled the covers over her chest while Seokjin\nsnickered at her frantic behavior.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Oh, my goodness. Sumin, I am almost\npositive that the castle workers know about our intimacy, so there is honestly\nno reason to hide it.&rdquo; He pointed out, earning him a smack and glare from\nSumin. </p><p>She\nthen shouted a quick, &ldquo;enter&rdquo;, before grabbing Seokjin&rsquo;s hands to prevent him\nfondling her under the sheets. </p><p>Moments\nlater, an out of breath castle servant came running in. The couple eyed the\nservant with curiosity. Why was he so tired? Did he honestly run all the way to\nher chambers? </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Sir Seokjin. Your highness. Your\nparents would like to request your presence for supper this evening.&rdquo; Announced\nthe royal messenger as he bowed his head in respect; though, he had been\ncareful to not lock gazes with them. </p><p>Sumin\nsmiled politely and acknowledged the message. She then instructed the messenger\nto tell her parents that she and Seokjin should be down shortly. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Yes, milady. Excuse me.&rdquo; The royal\nmessenger bowed once more before quickly excusing himself from their sight. </p><p>Once\nthey heard the door shut, tiny snickers filled the room as the royal couple\ncould not help but feel pity towards the poor man. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Let us not keep your mother and\nfather waiting much longer, princess.&rdquo; Seokjin suggested, pushing off the\ncovers and leaving the bed. He then bent down and picked up his discarded\nshirt. </p><p>Sumin\neyed his ass; an alluring smile painted on her lips. Her hormones were slowly\nworked up again, and Seokjin knew his princess all too well. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Stop eyeing me like how our horses\neye their carrots and get changed, Sumin.&rdquo; Seokjin instructed, securing his\nbelt around his pants. He wanted to look presentable since he was meeting his\nfuture-in-laws. </p><p>Sumin\npouted as she shuffled out of bed. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Wow&hellip;I cannot believe you called me\nby my actual name. You normally call me a pet name.&rdquo; She said, walking over to\nher wardrobe and scanning her many dresses. </p><p>Seokjin\nrolled his eyes, &ldquo;I do, but we need to hurry. I would fancy not having yet\nanother talk of when you are going to be with child.&rdquo; </p><p>Hearing\nhis statement caused Sumin to giggle softly as she picked out a dusty\nrose-colored dress and revealed her chose to Seokjin.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;What do you think, my beloved?&rdquo;\nasked Sumin, wanting her fianc&eacute;&rsquo;s opinion.</p><p>Seokjin\nturned around and eyed her dress of choice. His eyes scanned the incredible\nfloral detail in the lace that covered the satin dust rose skirt. The sleeves\nlooked like they would go past her elbows, and the straps would rest perfectly\non her shoulders. That tiny exposure was enough to rile him up yet still\nmaintained that sense of modesty. His fianc&eacute;e had wonderful taste in dresses.\nNow, if only she&rsquo;d fancy wearing them a lot more, then he would die a happy\nman. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;It is quite beautiful, my\nprincess.&rdquo; He confessed, smiling warmly. </p><p>Sumin\ngrinned brightly before disappearing to change into her dinner attire. Seconds\nlater, she resurfaced struggling to tie her dress. Sheesh, she could tie her\nsash, but she could not tie the strings that kept her corset nice and tight.\nThe last thing she needed was to reveal all the love marks that were <i>finally </i>fading. </p><p>Seokjin\nnoticed her struggles and cocked up his brow; an amused smirk graced his face. </p><p>He\ncalmly walked over to Sumin and offered his services. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;No, I can do it!&rdquo; She refused,\nstill struggling. </p><p>Seokjin\ngave her look and asked if she was sure. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Oh! Just help me, please!&rdquo; Sumin\npractically begged, growing annoyed with the fact that she needed help. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Why is that you dislike asking me\nfor help yet allow your lovely nurse to assist you with no problem?&rdquo; asked\nSeokjin as he quickly laced her corset and tightened the strings. </p><p>Sumin\nhuffed, &ldquo;That is because that I have no choice but to allow her to assist me.\nYou know how stubborn that nanny can be.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Whatever you say, sweetheart. You\njust do not like the idea of me helping you.&rdquo; Seokjin argued before placing a\nsweet kiss on her temple. </p><p>Sumin\nignored his comments and asked him if they could go down for supper, walking\ntowards the door and leaving behind Seokjin. </p><p>Seokjin\nwatched her retreating body create more space between them. Without a second\nthought, he rushed after. He shouted at her, demanding her to slow down and\nwait for him, but Sumin ignored him. </p><p>Here was\nher infamous &ldquo;play hard to get&rdquo; mood&hellip;</p><p>One\nwould think that Seokjin would have been used to this since she had always been\nlike that ever since they were children. However, it annoyed him back then, and\nit annoyed him now. </p><p>One of\nthe many moments where he questioned why he fell in love with this entertaining\nwoman. At least one thing was for certain, he would never grow bored of the\nsame old thing. </p><p>With\nthe dining hall in sight, Sumin peered over her shoulder and playfully winked\nat her frustrated knight. She quickly mouthed, &ldquo;I love you.&rdquo;, to him before\nmaking her presence known to her parents. </p><p>She\nhappily kissed her parents&rsquo; cheeks and asked them how they were doing this fine\nevening as she took her usual seat&mdash;right across from her mother and next to her\nfather, on his right side. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;It is always a delight to see your\nsmiling face, my treasured jewel.&rdquo; Sumin heard her father say. Hints of\ntiredness laced his voice. </p><p>Sumin\nremained smiling, wanting to the strength that both her parents desperately\nneeded during a time like this. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Well, you, mother, and Seokjin are\nmy reasons for smiling, so I am always quite happy.&rdquo; Sumin stated as she picked\nup her fork. </p><p>Sumin&rsquo;s\nfather nodded slowly; his eyes drooped a little bit. </p><p>Sumin&rsquo;s\nmother took noticed and nudged him slightly. Her heart ached for her ailing\nhusband. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Tell me daughter, how are yours and\nSeokjin&rsquo;s wedding preparation coming along? Do let me or your father know if\nthere is anything that you need.&rdquo; Sumin&rsquo;s mother inquired, fighting the urge to\nexcuse both her and her husband from the dinner table to rest in their\nchambers. </p><p>Sumin finished\nchewing the luxurious cut of meat and quickly patted her mouth with the napkin.\n</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Um&hellip;well&hellip;the wedding preparations\nare currently on hold.&rdquo; She shyly admitted, glancing at Seokjin, who was\nequally as nervous. </p><p>Both\nher mother and father eyed with both confusion and curiosity. They had thought that\ntheir daughter and her fianc&eacute; were close to being done. Now, they were hearing\nthat their wedding plans had been put on hold. Was it because of the war? </p><p>Sumin&rsquo;s\nfather gestured for Seokjin to come to the table which Seokjin obeyed. He left\nhis post and walked up to the royal family.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Yes, your majesty.&rdquo; He greeted,\nbowing his head in respect. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;May I ask why you and my daughter\npostponing the wedding?&rdquo; The king asked as he lifted his water goblet. </p><p>Seokjin\nnoted how shaky the king&rsquo;s hand was when he lifted the goblet. Poor Sumin. Her\nheart would be devastated once her father passes away. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Sumin and I discussed both the\nadvantages and disadvantages of having our wedding while there is talk of war,\nand we have concluded that it would be wise to wait until this over.&rdquo; Seokjin\nanswered, averting his gaze away from the king&rsquo;s. </p><p>The\nking rubbed his chin and directed his attention towards his daughter. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Is this true, Sumin?&rdquo; asked the\nKing, letting out a tiny painful groan. </p><p>Sumin\neyed her father with worried eyes; her heart honestly broke to see her father\nin such excruciating pain. She wanted nothing more to find a cure for whatever\nthat hurt her father. </p><p>Before\nshe could get carried away with her thoughts, her father called out to her,\nwondering why his daughter is unusually silent. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;My deepest apologies, father. I am\nsimply worried about you and failing health is all.&rdquo; She said, smiling sadly. </p><p>Her\nfather fought the tears that slowly pooled in his eyes. He never once liked\nlooking frail in front of his family but lately, his body was not getting the\nmessage. He saw bits and pieces of his life flashing before his eyes. It was if\nthe Holy father was telling him that his time was ending. </p><p>He\nslowly reached over and gently grasped his daughter&rsquo;s hand. He smiled warmly at\nher as he rested her hand on his cheek, feeling the warmth radiate from it. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Please do not worry about your old\nman, my darling daughter. I will continue to fight whatever it is that riddles\nmy body, and I want you to smile more and worry less about your mother and I,&rdquo;\nHe then held his wife&rsquo;s hand, &ldquo;We may be old, but we still have some fight left\nin us.&rdquo; He stated firmly with a determined smirk. </p><p>Sumin\nsimply nodded, not being able to find the next set of words. </p><p>Sumin&rsquo;s\nfather patted her on the bed and then excused himself from the table. It was\ntime for him and his wife to get plenty of rest. They had a long day ahead of\nthem tomorrow. </p><p>Sumin\nsaid goodnight to her parents and waited for them to leave the room before\nasking Seokjin if he wanted to take a walk with her. She desperately needed\nfresh air to clear her mind and erase the horrible sight that she was forced to\nwitness. </p><p>Small\ntears trickled down her face as short sniffles filled the dining hall, alerting\nthe castle staff. </p><p>They\ngrew unsure on what they should do next. Should they alert her parents? Should\nthey fetch her nanny? They hated seeing their beloved princess cry. </p><p>Luckily,\nthey didn&rsquo;t have to witness it much longer. Seokjin gently helped her up and\nwiped the tears away before it dropped to the floor. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;It will be alright, darling,&rdquo;\nSeokjin pecked her forehead, &ldquo;The king and queen will be fine. They just need a\ngood night&rsquo;s rest is all.&rdquo; He said softly, soothing her worries away. </p><p>Sumin sniffled,\ntrying her hardest to stop the tears but ultimately failing. She then pressed\nher face to Seokjin&rsquo;s chest, soaking his cotton shirt. Her sobs became\nuncontrollable. No words left her lips. Just choked out cries. </p><p>Seokjin\nrested his cheek on top of her head and gently rubbed her back. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Come, my love. Let us take a walk\nin the garden. I know there is something else bothering you.&rdquo; He suggested,\nslowly escorting the two of them out of the castle walls. </p><p>The\ncool breeze greeted the lovers first followed by the soothing smell of the\nsalty waves. The crescent moon barely peeped through the trees as it tried its\nhardest to illuminate the garden. Luckily, the glorious moon had the help from\nmany stars that twinkled high in the sky. </p><p>Seeing\nthe moon and starts, even maybe a few planets that decided to grace the world,\nalways brought a sense of tranquility within Sumin. She closed her eyes and\ndrank in the calming atmosphere that appeared before them. </p><p>Silence\nfilled the space between them, however, it was a comfortable silence. Seokjin\nknew what Sumin was about to say and vice versa. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Are you worried about me fighting\nin this war?&rdquo; asked Seokjin, lacing his fingers with hers. </p><p>Sumin\nsqueezed his hand and replied, &ldquo;I am not worried. I am afraid.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Why are you afraid, sweetheart?&rdquo;\nSeokjin questioned. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;I am afraid that you will not come\nback to me. I cannot bear the thought of losing both you and my father. You two\nare the most important men in my life. How can I go on living on this Earth\nwhere the two of you are not here?&rdquo; Sumin confessed her innermost concerns. Her\nheart pounded against the chest. The oxygen slowly left her lungs as she felt\nthis weird and tight feeling in the pit of her stomach. </p><p>Seokjin\nheard Sumin&rsquo;s sporadic breathing and pulled her into a loving embrace. He\nrested his chin on top of her head and uttered words of love and comfort. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;I do not want to marry that horrid\nKing Ji Yong. I will not!&rdquo; Sumin declared, alerting Seokjin.</p><p>Upon\nhearing his name, Seokjin&rsquo;s body immediately tensed, and a sudden wave of fury\nengulfed his body. That evil king would not leave his princess alone, and\nSeokjin had grown tired of him. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Sumin, what are you talking about?&rdquo;\nSeokjin inquired, glancing down at her. </p><p>Sumin\nremained silent, unsure if she should finally tell him the truth. </p><p>After\nquickly debating, Sumin opened her mouth and said,</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;It is King Ji Yong&hellip; he&hellip;&rdquo;</p><hr /><p><small><b>A/N: </b>Oh my goodness! We are nearing the end of my favorite story that I had ever written to date. I honestly feel like that the love I bear for Seokjin shows in my mind, and I wouldn&rsquo;t have it any other way! He deserves nothing but the best! Anyway, I hope you up like this update and~ as of today (7.16.2018 // I already wrote this and then scheduled it to be published lol), I&rsquo;m thinking that the first chapter of the sequel should be up sometime in August!

In that kingdom, the royal family had the freedom of marrying whoever his or her royal highness deems worthy. Now, of course, having that special privilege came with some interesting challenges, but that doesn&rsquo;t stop a certain head-strong princess from doing whatever her heart&rsquo;s desire, especially when she has her heart set on marrying her personal bodyguard. Unfortunately, her beliefs might face some hardships when a certain king sets his eye on her. Will her bodyguard continue to fight for her or is it finally her turn?</small></p>\n<p><small>&#8251; <b>Previously: </b><a href=\"http://jinniesbby.tumblr.com/post/175791445214/fight-for-me-ch1\">ch.1</a>&nbsp;| <a href=\"http://jinniesbby.tumblr.com/post/175887448405/fight-for-me-ch2\">ch.2</a> | <a href=\"http://jinniesbby.tumblr.com/post/175993838175/fight-for-me-ch3\">ch.3</a> | <a href=\"http://jinniesbby.tumblr.com/post/176061680692/fight-for-me-ch4\">ch.4</a> | <a href=\"http://jinniesbby.tumblr.com/post/176129746496/fight-for-me-ch5\">ch.5</a><br /></small></p>\n<p><small>&#8251; <b>Next Time:</b> <a href=\"http://jinniesbby.tumblr.com/post/176307635761/fight-for-me-final-chapter\">final chapter</a></small></p>\n<hr />\n<h2><i>Chapter 6: This is War</i></h2>\n</p>",
