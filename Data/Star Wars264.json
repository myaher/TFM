Nothing new takes away something I already had before. There is already a lot of stories in Star Wars which I didn&rsquo;t really enjoy as much as the rest, but they are still Star Wars and created more life in to the universe I&rsquo;ve grown to love so much.<br/><br/>Reason why I personally love TLJ is because I do film editing and I&rsquo;m seriously interested about writing and filming overall. TLJ had few of the most amazing scenes I&rsquo;ve seen in cinema and it bowed down to Ralph McQuarrie bringin his concepts to the film.<br/>Movie has also overall amazing color grading and other visual elements. It build a story visually rather than depending on telling audience some of the obvious things already shown to them (something I hated in Force Awakens). This is also part of the complaint I&rsquo;ve read like how DJ knew Resistance plan to go Crait. Damn movie shows him listening when Finn and Rose contact Poe. Movie depends on audience to notice these little visual things that has even their own scenes.<br/>Also I love how they portrayed Luke and I love the connection between Rey and Kylo.<br/>There was also a lot of things which I though wasn&rsquo;t so good, but maybe because they didn&rsquo;t make the movie for me, but for a large audience. They gave cool stuff for everyone. Like I didn&rsquo;t like Poes jokes at the beginning, but a lot of kids laughed and enjoyed those jokes when I was in the theatre.\n\n<br/></p>",

It&rsquo;s just a dream!&ldquo; His words fell on deaf ears as she continued\nto fight him. A rock flew past him, narrowly missing his head, and exploded\nagainst the wall behind them. Somminick closed his eyes and reached out through\nthe Force in an attempt to wake her before she hurt the both of them. </p><p>\u00a0A sudden vision\nenveloped him, of fire and death and darkness. Screams filled his ears and\nblood fell like rain as he stared out onto a battlefield of flames. Shadowy\nfigures rushed by him, faces indistinguishable save for eyes burning like dark\nsuns.

A young\nA'vien stood beside him, barely more than ten years old, tears streaming down\nher cheeks, brilliant green eyes staring out at the scene. Small clenched fists\nshook, from grief or rage Somminick was unsure but he did not wish to find out.\nKneeling to the child&rsquo;s level, he placed his hands on her small shoulders,\nforcing her to look at him.</p><p>\u00a0&quot;A'vien, you\nneed to wake up. Everything will be alright, but I need you to wake up!&ldquo;\nTear filled eyes stared at him uncomprehendingly, dark brows coming together in\nconfusion. A flicker of recognition echoed deep in her emerald green eyes and\nshe opened her mouth to say something. What she was preparing to say, Somminick\nnever found out, as an explosion erupted from the center of the field where the\ntwo combatants were.</p><p>\u00a0&quot;A'vien, A'vien,\nI need you to look at me, A'vien look at me!&rdquo; But his desperate pleas went\nunheeded as the child looked back out to the field. The light warrior lay at\nthe feet of darkness, all brilliance extinguished. </p><p>\u00a0A sob caught in\nA'vien&rsquo;s throat, and as the Jedi watched, the grief in her eyes morphed into\nrage. Small, trembling hands reached down to her belt where there hung a small\nlightsaber. Blue light, not unlike Somminick&rsquo;s own weapon, sprung from the hilt\nas she handled it with an ease that spoke of experience. The Jedi&rsquo;s heart fell\ninto his gut with horror as he realized what he was seeing.</p><p>\u00a0This was not a dream.\nThis was a memory.</p><p>\u00a0Stunned, he could\nonly watch as the small figure leapt across the field towards the creature of\nflames, furious tears streaming down her face. She looked even smaller next to\nthe gigantic man, but that did nothing to phase her. Swinging wildly, A'vien\nscreamed, grief and anger mingling together to create a haunting sound that\nSomminick would remember for decades to come.</p><p>\u00a0The giant man looked\ndown at the small child calmly, a sick, twisted amusement on his face. With a\nwave of his hand, the blue lightsaber flew out of A'vien&rsquo;s small fingers to\nland at Somminick&rsquo;s feet. Numbly, the Jedi picked it up, mind barely\nregistering what he was doing. </p><p>\u00a0Reaching down, the\nblazing monster wrapped a hand around the small child&rsquo;s neck, lifting her up\noff the ground. Legs flailed wildly as A'vien struggled to free herself, tiny\nfingers scrabbling at the gauntlet covered appendage, strained wheezing echoing\nacross to the unmoving Jedi master.</p><p>\u00a0Somminick shook\nhimself out of his shocked trance and turned on the lightsaber in his hand,\ngrip tightening around the unfamiliar hilt. Facing the creature of darkness,\nthe Mirialan tried to move forward, but no amount of struggling or use of the\nForce would allow him to take even a single step.</p><p>\u00a0Looking up, forest\ngreen eyes met imploring emerald as A'vien reached out to him desperately. A\nfrustrated shout escaped Somminick&rsquo;s lips as he tried futilely to break free\nfrom whatever held him in place.</p><p>\u00a0A choked gasp had him\nlooking up again and the Jedi watched in horror as dark shadows slunk from the\nmonster onto A'vien&rsquo;s pale skin, deceptively hypnotic as it spread over her\nentire body. Kicking legs stilled as bloody hands fell limply to hang by her\nsides. Golden fury began to creep in over grief stricken green, and Somminick\nwatched in terror as the child&rsquo;s innocent eyes slowly transformed into\nsomething completely alien and angry.</p><p>\u00a0It was definitely\ntime to wake up. Surprise flickered in the back of his mind as he remembered\nthat this was a dream. A'vien was not a child anymore and Master Somminick\nTimmns had never been here. More importantly, while he could do nothing about\nthe past, there was something he could do about the present and no one was\ndying today. Not on his watch.</p><p>\u00a0The Jedi master took\na deep breath, mentally praying to anyone that was listening, that what he was\nabout to do would work.

A\nsight behind him stopped him in his tracks.</p><p>\u00a0Two figures battled\neach other in the center of the field in a brutal fight. One blazing with all\nthe fury of a hellish inferno, darkness leeching off him like a plague, and the\nother brilliant like the sun, light spilling every which way. The sight of the\ntwo mesmerized Somminick, the Jedi unable to take his eyes off them. </p><p>\u00a0The fight came to a\nsudden end as the shadowy monster vanquished his foe with a rage filled roar.\nThe luminous figure fell to his knees, flickering and dimming as shadows\nravaged the light. </p><p>\u00a0\"No!\u201d </p><p>\u00a0Startled, Somminick\nturned next to him, where the heartbroken scream had originated from. A young\nA'vien stood beside him, barely more than ten years old, tears streaming down\nher cheeks, brilliant green eyes staring out at the scene. Small clenched fists\nshook, from grief or rage Somminick was unsure but he did not wish to find out.\nKneeling to the child\u2019s level, he placed his hands on her small shoulders,\nforcing her to look at him.</p><p>\u00a0\"A'vien, you\nneed to wake up. Everything will be alright, but I need you to wake up!\u201c\nTear filled eyes stared at him uncomprehendingly, dark brows coming together in\nconfusion. A flicker of recognition echoed deep in her emerald green eyes and\nshe opened her mouth to say something. What she was preparing to say, Somminick\nnever found out, as an explosion erupted from the center of the field where the\ntwo combatants were.</p><p>\u00a0\"A'vien, A'vien,\nI need you to look at me, A'vien look at me!\u201d But his desperate pleas went\nunheeded as the child looked back out to the field. The light warrior lay at\nthe feet of darkness, all brilliance extinguished. </p><p>\u00a0A sob caught in\nA'vien\u2019s throat, and as the Jedi watched, the grief in her eyes morphed into\nrage. Small, trembling hands reached down to her belt where there hung a small\nlightsaber. Blue light, not unlike Somminick\u2019s own weapon, sprung from the hilt\nas she handled it with an ease that spoke of experience. The Jedi\u2019s heart fell\ninto his gut with horror as he realized what he was seeing.</p><p>\u00a0This was not a dream.\nThis was a memory.</p><p>\u00a0Stunned, he could\nonly watch as the small figure leapt across the field towards the creature of\nflames, furious tears streaming down her face. She looked even smaller next to\nthe gigantic man, but that did nothing to phase her. Swinging wildly, A'vien\nscreamed, grief and anger mingling together to create a haunting sound that\nSomminick would remember for decades to come.</p><p>\u00a0The giant man looked\ndown at the small child calmly, a sick, twisted amusement on his face. With a\nwave of his hand, the blue lightsaber flew out of A'vien\u2019s small fingers to\nland at Somminick\u2019s feet. Numbly, the Jedi picked it up, mind barely\nregistering what he was doing. </p><p>\u00a0Reaching down, the\nblazing monster wrapped a hand around the small child\u2019s neck, lifting her up\noff the ground. Legs flailed wildly as A'vien struggled to free herself, tiny\nfingers scrabbling at the gauntlet covered appendage, strained wheezing echoing\nacross to the unmoving Jedi master.</p><p>\u00a0Somminick shook\nhimself out of his shocked trance and turned on the lightsaber in his hand,\ngrip tightening around the unfamiliar hilt. Facing the creature of darkness,\nthe Mirialan tried to move forward, but no amount of struggling or use of the\nForce would allow him to take even a single step.</p><p>\u00a0Looking up, forest\ngreen eyes met imploring emerald as A'vien reached out to him desperately. A\nfrustrated shout escaped Somminick\u2019s lips as he tried futilely to break free\nfrom whatever held him in place.</p><p>\u00a0A choked gasp had him\nlooking up again and the Jedi watched in horror as dark shadows slunk from the\nmonster onto A'vien\u2019s pale skin, deceptively hypnotic as it spread over her\nentire body. Kicking legs stilled as bloody hands fell limply to hang by her\nsides. Golden fury began to creep in over grief stricken green, and Somminick\nwatched in terror as the child\u2019s innocent eyes slowly transformed into\nsomething completely alien and angry.</p><p>\u00a0It was definitely\ntime to wake up. Surprise flickered in the back of his mind as he remembered\nthat this was a dream. A'vien was not a child anymore and Master Somminick\nTimmns had never been here. More importantly, while he could do nothing about\nthe past, there was something he could do about the present and no one was\ndying today. Not on his watch.</p><p>\u00a0The Jedi master took\na deep breath, mentally praying to anyone that was listening, that what he was\nabout to do would work.

Night had fallen outside, with twin moons basking the barren\nland with silver light. The winds had quieted for the time being and silence\nreigned over the peaceful landscape. </p><p>&nbsp;Somminick gazed into\nthe light of the campfire, lost in his thoughts. It had been quite some time\nsince he had last seen A'vien. Back when times were simpler and Sith were bad\nand Jedi were good. He had never been quite that naive as to think that things\nwere as black and white as that, but since he had met the young Sith Lord, his\nview on the galaxy had altered.</p><p>&nbsp;They had been in and\nout of contact since their friendly departure after the Ekkage incident. Little\ncheck-ins here and there had been their main form of communication, each making\nsure the other was still alive. Somminick had been covertly keeping tabs on the\nyounger Force user and he had no doubt that she had been doing the same.\nThrough their small interactions, an unconventional friendship had bloomed.\nThey had started out as enemies but now Somminick would not be hard pressed to\ncall the Sith an ally, if not a friend.</p><p>&nbsp;The enemy of my enemy\nis my friend. A smile creased across his face at the literal turn that phrase\nhad taken. </p><p>&nbsp;Glancing down at the\nprone Sith, his brows furrowed once more. Soon after he had finished bandaging\nher wounds, a fever had started, stealing away the calm, healing sleep that\nA'vien sorely needed. </p><p>&nbsp;Somminick dipped a\ncloth into a makeshift bowl he had created from a broken stone, soaking it in\ncool water from a spring he had found in the cavern. Wringing it out, he mopped\nthe Sith&rsquo;s burning forehead gently, muttering healing words under his breath.\nFevered mumbling escaped from A'vien&rsquo;s lips, spoken in yet another language the\nJedi did not recognize. If there was anything that he had learned about his\nyoung friend, it was that the amount of languages she knew was impressive.\nSomminick had the sneaking suspicion however, that a majority of the words were\nvariations on curses and swears. The Sith Lord had a remarkable talent for\ninsults, as he had very quickly discovered.</p><p>&nbsp;A groan echoed from\nthe twitching Sith, as she began to move more frantically in her fevered sleep.\nPleading words began to spill out her mouth quicker and louder as the Jedi\nstruggled to restrain her. All his work would be undone if she continued to\nmove around so wildly.</p><p>&nbsp;\"A'vien! A'vien\nwake up! It&rsquo;s just a dream!&ldquo; His words fell on deaf ears as she continued\nto fight him. A rock flew past him, narrowly missing his head, and exploded\nagainst the wall behind them. Somminick closed his eyes and reached out through\nthe Force in an attempt to wake her before she hurt the both of them. </p><p>&nbsp;A sudden vision\nenveloped him, of fire and death and darkness. Screams filled his ears and\nblood fell like rain as he stared out onto a battlefield of flames. Shadowy\nfigures rushed by him, faces indistinguishable save for eyes burning like dark\nsuns.
