        "body": "<p>Ok, so I\u2019ve been watching Game of Thrones with my mother and since Season 7, I have vehemently been in favour of Starks.</p><p>Now, my mother keeps asking me why I have suddenly given up on Dany as a Queen. She says that I am biased against her for Sansa. Well, for sure, that might be true. But there are many reasons.\u00a0</p><p><b>Disclaimer: I haven\u2019t yet finished all the books so I will reserve commenting and judgement on them. As a lit student, it is expected of me to be critical of the source itself as my professors kindly pointed out but that\u2019s bull. Even a script is a source right? Especially when the show is different from the book.\u00a0</b></p><p><b>Also, Sansa is not here. This isn\u2019t a comparison. This is just showing Dany is not a good queen or fit to rule anything.</b></p><p>So here I go.</p><!-- more --><p>Dany was Stormborn, hence the name. She was Princess of Dragonstone, a babe left motherless and under the care of her brother who steadily grew vicious and insanely power-hungry. Let\u2019s keep his entitlement aside for the moment. We know he was present in King\u2019s Landing, he knew what being a Royal, a Prince meant. He wanted that life - I can understand that.</p><p>But Viserys\u2019s decline made him susceptible, his protectors filled his ears with false truths to take blatant advantage of him and he was as much a victim of poor counsel as Dany. Only, he never reached the point of realising that or being able to do anything about it. By the time, he could, he was far gone into his mind that he was too far to be brought back.\u00a0</p><p>It could be during his teens or early twenties when he started his descent. This is probably when he turned of Dany, already blaming her of their mother\u2019s death and\u00a0\u2018waking the dragon\u2019.\u00a0</p><p>Viserys, we\u2019ve all known as a villain. Why? Because he was portrayed as one to us while Dany was a poor helpless girl.\u00a0</p><p>Dany must have known that her brother was being wrongfully led by Illyrio. She even said so to Jorah. Even Jorah told her that people in Westeros prayed for a better life, not rulers. So why is it that Dany\u2019s mindset doesn\u2019t undergo a change? Again, we will leave the Entitlement for later when we see it portrayed in location.</p><p>Coming down to why she is very like Viserys is when we start to see her grow. She just hides it better. Daenarys was lucky to have Drogo, because he was as good a husband as she could find among Dothraki. If she had been married to another, who probably had more than just her as a wife, as we see later, I doubt she would\u2019ve fared well. But we see her growing accustomed to a life of violence very easily. When she had people to back her, she had no reason to fear a much stronger Viserys and managed to throw him off easily, even letting her Khal kill him when she knew that he was dangerous but also useless.\u00a0</p><p>The line she says that\u00a0\u201cFire cannot kill a dragon.\u201d is also telling. She never saw Viserys as family since she considers herself a dragon.But she is very impressed by Rhaegar (known as the last dragon) Where do we see that same quality?\u00a0</p><p>Cersei. She hates one brother (parallels - mothers die at childbirth, both dislike each other) and loves the other, who shows qualities that favor her.</p><p>Her brilliancy and why I like her (Yes, I do) is how well she moulds it. She never turned vicious personally. She never became Viserys, or Joffrey or Ramsay, thank god. Did she have potential? Fuck yes, she is a product of incest, inbreeding always leaves it\u2019s mark and there was a running streak of danger in their wake.</p><p>She was good, kind, generous and knew her strengths and she played them well.</p><p>She was also good and letting people be violent for her. She wants to go\u00a0\u201chome\u201d yet she would let her Husband and his men pilfer, pillage, rape in the homeland she wants. Is that a mark of a good queen?\u00a0</p><p>No, this is when I realised, Dany would never work in Westeros.</p><p>Sure, Westeros has had bad rulers, Joffrey, Cersei, Mad King but a ruler who attacks the country - not only with Dragons but also outsiders who have no control?\u00a0</p><p>The Maegi saw this, the Maegi acted. You cannot pretend that she wasn\u2019t thinking of Westeros similar to her land when she took her revenge. You also cannot pretend that Dany would\u2019ve been able to stop Drogo from letting his Khalasar destroy Westeros as she tried to do before. Drogo himself sided with his men before saying he wouldn\u2019t hear anything about it. What did his men do? They rebelled and fought. Would Drogo take such a risk in Westeros, a foreign land? I don\u2019t think so. It would\u2019ve been him, who would be ruler because Dothraki don\u2019t recognise female leaders, not unless she manages to rise from flame unharmed. Were Drogo alive, Dany would never be put in fire and never have such command.\u00a0</p><p>She was still willing to lead such a hoard to the West. This just adds to how short-sighted her venture was. So she kills the witch, and from her blood, magics Dragons into the world.</p><p>From the moment we get to Quarth, we can see Dany in the position Viserys was in, fraternal because she was Mother to Dragons. She was much more better a candidate than her brother would ever be. Dany takes time to realise this as well, but since she has to as the good guy, she finds out about Daxos and Doreah and locks them in to die. Again, a death that is understandable.</p><p>We\u2019ll skip Yunkai and Astapor. It was clear here that Dany\u2019s luck was phenomenal and so was her act of deceit. She barters and then betrays. I understand the\u00a0\u201cUnsullied\u201d scene. A dragon in that bastard\u2019s hand called for emergency and Dany handles it well.</p><p>Yunkai was a mess. The Second Son\u2019s Daario just so happens to fall for the pretty queen and betrays his partners. She \u201cliberates\u201d the city&hellip;then leaves it to be. What? Where\u2019s the order? You think they\u2019re just magically going to figure out a system when you TAKE the system and kill it?\u00a0</p><p>Her Conqueror and not Ruler side is glaringly obvious here.</p><p>She does the same in Mereen.\u00a0</p><p>Now, I have a few points to say for her \u201cadvisers\u201d. We\u2019ll start with Missandei. She is a translator and undoubtedly very useful and very loyal. She also gives the common people a voice&hellip;then why does she not do that? She says it\u2019snot her place, not because she thinks herself inferior but because she knows no politics. And ruling is politics. Killing off the Masters was terrorising, an act of control. Missandei keeps saying that if she wished it Dany would let her go back to Naath. Guess what? She does want to as we see in S8, then why hasn\u2019t she done so?</p><p>Surely she doesn\u2019t want to die in a battle that is strictly speaking not hers since she doesn\u2019t even want to stay in Westeros. She wants to leave\u00a0\u201cwhen this is over\u201d so what is making her stay? Loyalty&hellip;or fear?</p><p>Grey Worm, bless his soul is easier. He was a slave, and still is. No one can persuade me that Grey Worm doesn\u2019t feel still subjugated. He was made into a soldier, not trained. You cannot just burn someone\u2019s masters, no matter how cruel, ask your now freed soldiers to fight or leave and expect anyone to leave. All they know is war. Where will they go even if they leave? You burned their city and they have no life. Psychologically, you hold the whip, you own them.\u00a0</p><p>It\u2019s highly unlikely Grey Worm has forgotten this. But he is starting to with Missandei. He will want to leave with her and Dany will lose the main man to control her army. Let\u2019s see how she reacts. If Dany as her character arc in S8 is the same, she will be mad, but if the directors want to keep her squeaky clean she will be happy. Don\u2019t trust D&amp;D.</p><p>Jorah and Barristan who were the most knowledgeable in Westerosi politics, both are shown to be lost to her. Either this is a play that Dany just doesn\u2019t want to listen to reason or that she doesn\u2019t care.</p><p>Her rule in Mereen is nothing short of incompetent and stupid. To rule you have to understand the city. Instead of letting the city stay as it were under her rule, making changes she saw would benefit the residents, she immediately expects the city and public to change in adherence to her. The Crucifixion was also dumb. You don\u2019t want people to do that, so what\u2019s the best way to ensure that they don\u2019t? Oh yeah, do exactly that. Instead of settling the city, she destroyed it\u2019s foundations and insults it\u2019s traditions. She calls it Liberation, it is actually called A Dumbass Dictator.</p><p>Naturally she is met by resistance in Sons of Harpy and the Masters who wanted to take back Mereen in her absence.</p><p>Mereen solidified my claim that Dany cannot rule. Even Daario says\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re a conqueror, not meant to be Queen\u201d</p><p>She leaved the man who can actually advise her against cheats and frauds, I mean, what?</p><p>Now, let\u2019s see her behaviour with Westerosi people.\u00a0</p><p>Her entitlement is stupidly obvious here and how much she is like Viserys and the Mad King is being made glaring. She expects people, people that her family quelled by fear, that her father tormented, people that wholeheartedly supported Robert\u2019s Rebellion to expect the daughter of a king who was famous for burning people. Lookie, Dany is famous for that too now with the Tarlys. Like father, like daughter.</p><p>When she tells Jon to not judge her by her father\u2019s crime, it is expected of you to not repeat those crimes. You cannot give men who hate your house to bend the knee or die. You cannot burn people and then cry,\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m not my father&hellip;who also burned people.\u201d</p><p>Dany is parallel to how the Man king killed Brandon and Rickard Stark. Father and Son killed together by father, and now by daughter.</p><p>She also gives the Greyjoys, Dorne and Olenna free reign but won\u2019t give North it\u2019s independence. Why? Because they were important, they were helping her and she needed allies. Her need is free to compromise but the North\u2019s isn\u2019t. She recognised that now she is in the position of power, so she can walk around bossing people about.</p><p>\u201cMy father killed your lords and I have done the same but I am a better ruler.\u201d</p><p>That is such bull. Her entitlement and her stupidity made me lose all respect I had for her. She admits to knowing the game but is shown to be least bothered with it. Her idea of breaking the wheel was impressive, before I realised that she didn\u2019t want a wheel simply because she wanted to be the sole holder of power. If that isn\u2019t Dictatorship then what is?\u00a0</p><p>She makes it a point that without dragons she is nothing, Targaryens were nothing special without their mounts and they are her children. She is also least concerned by them. I have not yet seen her mourn Viserion and I cried for the entire night. TMI&hellip;</p><p>Also, Sansa is just plain better and Dany disrespects her a lot. She comes into her home. and what? Sprawls out with her extra men and that\u00a0\u201cWhatever they want\u201d??\u00a0</p><p>Winterfell is where we started our story. It is our home, our Hogwarts, we fought to get it back with Jon and Sansa and for Dany to mock it with no concern is plain infuriating.</p><p>Also, where and when did she become a manipulator?

This is just showing Dany is not a good queen or fit to rule anything.</b></p><p>So here I go.</p>[[MORE]]<p>Dany was Stormborn, hence the name. She was Princess of Dragonstone, a babe left motherless and under the care of her brother who steadily grew vicious and insanely power-hungry. Let\u2019s keep his entitlement aside for the moment. We know he was present in King\u2019s Landing, he knew what being a Royal, a Prince meant. He wanted that life - I can understand that.</p><p>But Viserys\u2019s decline made him susceptible, his protectors filled his ears with false truths to take blatant advantage of him and he was as much a victim of poor counsel as Dany. Only, he never reached the point of realising that or being able to do anything about it. By the time, he could, he was far gone into his mind that he was too far to be brought back.\u00a0</p><p>It could be during his teens or early twenties when he started his descent. This is probably when he turned of Dany, already blaming her of their mother\u2019s death and\u00a0\u2018waking the dragon\u2019.\u00a0</p><p>Viserys, we\u2019ve all known as a villain. Why? Because he was portrayed as one to us while Dany was a poor helpless girl.\u00a0</p><p>Dany must have known that her brother was being wrongfully led by Illyrio. She even said so to Jorah. Even Jorah told her that people in Westeros prayed for a better life, not rulers. So why is it that Dany\u2019s mindset doesn\u2019t undergo a change? Again, we will leave the Entitlement for later when we see it portrayed in location.</p><p>Coming down to why she is very like Viserys is when we start to see her grow. She just hides it better. Daenarys was lucky to have Drogo, because he was as good a husband as she could find among Dothraki. If she had been married to another, who probably had more than just her as a wife, as we see later, I doubt she would\u2019ve fared well. But we see her growing accustomed to a life of violence very easily. When she had people to back her, she had no reason to fear a much stronger Viserys and managed to throw him off easily, even letting her Khal kill him when she knew that he was dangerous but also useless.\u00a0</p><p>The line she says that\u00a0\u201cFire cannot kill a dragon.\u201d is also telling.

This is just showing Dany is not a good queen or fit to rule anything.</b></p><p>So here I go.</p>[[MORE]]<p>Dany was Stormborn, hence the name. She was Princess of Dragonstone, a babe left motherless and under the care of her brother who steadily grew vicious and insanely power-hungry. Let\u2019s keep his entitlement aside for the moment. We know he was present in King\u2019s Landing, he knew what being a Royal, a Prince meant. He wanted that life - I can understand that.</p><p>But Viserys\u2019s decline made him susceptible, his protectors filled his ears with false truths to take blatant advantage of him and he was as much a victim of poor counsel as Dany. Only, he never reached the point of realising that or being able to do anything about it. By the time, he could, he was far gone into his mind that he was too far to be brought back.\u00a0</p><p>It could be during his teens or early twenties when he started his descent. This is probably when he turned of Dany, already blaming her of their mother\u2019s death and\u00a0\u2018waking the dragon\u2019.\u00a0</p><p>Viserys, we\u2019ve all known as a villain. Why? Because he was portrayed as one to us while Dany was a poor helpless girl.\u00a0</p><p>Dany must have known that her brother was being wrongfully led by Illyrio. She even said so to Jorah. Even Jorah told her that people in Westeros prayed for a better life, not rulers. So why is it that Dany\u2019s mindset doesn\u2019t undergo a change? Again, we will leave the Entitlement for later when we see it portrayed in location.</p><p>Coming down to why she is very like Viserys is when we start to see her grow. She just hides it better. Daenarys was lucky to have Drogo, because he was as good a husband as she could find among Dothraki. If she had been married to another, who probably had more than just her as a wife, as we see later, I doubt she would\u2019ve fared well. But we see her growing accustomed to a life of violence very easily. When she had people to back her, she had no reason to fear a much stronger Viserys and managed to throw him off easily, even letting her Khal kill him when she knew that he was dangerous but also useless.\u00a0</p><p>The line she says that\u00a0\u201cFire cannot kill a dragon.\u201d is also telling. She never saw Viserys as family since she considers herself a dragon.But she is very impressed by Rhaegar (known as the last dragon) Where do we see that same quality?\u00a0</p><p>Cersei. She hates one brother (parallels - mothers die at childbirth, both dislike each other) and loves the other, who shows qualities that favor her.</p><p>Her brilliancy and why I like her (Yes, I do) is how well she moulds it. She never turned vicious personally. She never became Viserys, or Joffrey or Ramsay, thank god. Did she have potential? Fuck yes, she is a product of incest, inbreeding always leaves it\u2019s mark and there was a running streak of danger in their wake.</p><p>She was good, kind, generous and knew her strengths and she played them well.</p><p>She was also good and letting people be violent for her. She wants to go\u00a0\u201chome\u201d yet she would let her Husband and his men pilfer, pillage, rape in the homeland she wants. Is that a mark of a good queen?\u00a0</p><p>No, this is when I realised, Dany would never work in Westeros.</p><p>Sure, Westeros has had bad rulers, Joffrey, Cersei, Mad King but a ruler who attacks the country - not only with Dragons but also outsiders who have no control?\u00a0</p><p>The Maegi saw this, the Maegi acted. You cannot pretend that she wasn\u2019t thinking of Westeros similar to her land when she took her revenge. You also cannot pretend that Dany would\u2019ve been able to stop Drogo from letting his Khalasar destroy Westeros as she tried to do before. Drogo himself sided with his men before saying he wouldn\u2019t hear anything about it. What did his men do? They rebelled and fought. Would Drogo take such a risk in Westeros, a foreign land? I don\u2019t think so. It would\u2019ve been him, who would be ruler because Dothraki don\u2019t recognise female leaders, not unless she manages to rise from flame unharmed. Were Drogo alive, Dany would never be put in fire and never have such command.\u00a0</p><p>She was still willing to lead such a hoard to the West. This just adds to how short-sighted her venture was. So she kills the witch, and from her blood, magics Dragons into the world.</p><p>From the moment we get to Quarth, we can see Dany in the position Viserys was in, fraternal because she was Mother to Dragons. She was much more better a candidate than her brother would ever be. Dany takes time to realise this as well, but since she has to as the good guy, she finds out about Daxos and Doreah and locks them in to die. Again, a death that is understandable.</p><p>We\u2019ll skip Yunkai and Astapor. It was clear here that Dany\u2019s luck was phenomenal and so was her act of deceit. She barters and then betrays. I understand the\u00a0\u201cUnsullied\u201d scene. A dragon in that bastard\u2019s hand called for emergency and Dany handles it well.</p><p>Yunkai was a mess. The Second Son\u2019s Daario just so happens to fall for the pretty queen and betrays his partners. She \u201cliberates\u201d the city\u2026then leaves it to be. What? Where\u2019s the order? You think they\u2019re just magically going to figure out a system when you TAKE the system and kill it?\u00a0</p><p>Her Conqueror and not Ruler side is glaringly obvious here.</p><p>She does the same in Mereen.\u00a0</p><p>Now, I have a few points to say for her \u201cadvisers\u201d. We\u2019ll start with Missandei. She is a translator and undoubtedly very useful and very loyal. She also gives the common people a voice\u2026then why does she not do that? She says it\u2019snot her place, not because she thinks herself inferior but because she knows no politics. And ruling is politics. Killing off the Masters was terrorising, an act of control. Missandei keeps saying that if she wished it Dany would let her go back to Naath. Guess what? She does want to as we see in S8, then why hasn\u2019t she done so?</p><p>Surely she doesn\u2019t want to die in a battle that is strictly speaking not hers since she doesn\u2019t even want to stay in Westeros. She wants to leave\u00a0\u201cwhen this is over\u201d so what is making her stay? Loyalty\u2026or fear?</p><p>Grey Worm, bless his soul is easier. He was a slave, and still is. No one can persuade me that Grey Worm doesn\u2019t feel still subjugated. He was made into a soldier, not trained. You cannot just burn someone\u2019s masters, no matter how cruel, ask your now freed soldiers to fight or leave and expect anyone to leave. All they know is war. Where will they go even if they leave? You burned their city and they have no life. Psychologically, you hold the whip, you own them.\u00a0</p><p>It\u2019s highly unlikely Grey Worm has forgotten this. But he is starting to with Missandei. He will want to leave with her and Dany will lose the main man to control her army. Let\u2019s see how she reacts. If Dany as her character arc in S8 is the same, she will be mad, but if the directors want to keep her squeaky clean she will be happy. Don\u2019t trust D&amp;D.</p><p>Jorah and Barristan who were the most knowledgeable in Westerosi politics, both are shown to be lost to her. Either this is a play that Dany just doesn\u2019t want to listen to reason or that she doesn\u2019t care.</p><p>Her rule in Mereen is nothing short of incompetent and stupid. To rule you have to understand the city. Instead of letting the city stay as it were under her rule, making changes she saw would benefit the residents, she immediately expects the city and public to change in adherence to her. The Crucifixion was also dumb. You don\u2019t want people to do that, so what\u2019s the best way to ensure that they don\u2019t? Oh yeah, do exactly that. Instead of settling the city, she destroyed it\u2019s foundations and insults it\u2019s traditions. She calls it Liberation, it is actually called A Dumbass Dictator.</p><p>Naturally she is met by resistance in Sons of Harpy and the Masters who wanted to take back Mereen in her absence.</p><p>Mereen solidified my claim that Dany cannot rule. Even Daario says\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re a conqueror, not meant to be Queen\u201d</p><p>She leaved the man who can actually advise her against cheats and frauds, I mean, what?</p><p>Now, let\u2019s see her behaviour with Westerosi people.\u00a0</p><p>Her entitlement is stupidly obvious here and how much she is like Viserys and the Mad King is being made glaring. She expects people, people that her family quelled by fear, that her father tormented, people that wholeheartedly supported Robert\u2019s Rebellion to expect the daughter of a king who was famous for burning people. Lookie, Dany is famous for that too now with the Tarlys. Like father, like daughter.</p><p>When she tells Jon to not judge her by her father\u2019s crime, it is expected of you to not repeat those crimes. You cannot give men who hate your house to bend the knee or die. You cannot burn people and then cry,\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m not my father\u2026who also burned people.\u201d</p><p>Dany is parallel to how the Man king killed Brandon and Rickard Stark. Father and Son killed together by father, and now by daughter.</p><p>She also gives the Greyjoys, Dorne and Olenna free reign but won\u2019t give North it\u2019s independence. Why? Because they were important, they were helping her and she needed allies. Her need is free to compromise but the North\u2019s isn\u2019t. She recognised that now she is in the position of power, so she can walk around bossing people about.</p><p>\u201cMy father killed your lords and I have done the same but I am a better ruler.\u201d</p><p>That is such bull. Her entitlement and her stupidity made me lose all respect I had for her. She admits to knowing the game but is shown to be least bothered with it. Her idea of breaking the wheel was impressive, before I realised that she didn\u2019t want a wheel simply because she wanted to be the sole holder of power. If that isn\u2019t Dictatorship then what is?\u00a0</p><p>She makes it a point that without dragons she is nothing, Targaryens were nothing special without their mounts and they are her children. She is also least concerned by them. I have not yet seen her mourn Viserion and I cried for the entire night. TMI\u2026</p><p>Also, Sansa is just plain better and Dany disrespects her a lot. She comes into her home. and what? Sprawls out with her extra men and that\u00a0\u201cWhatever they want\u201d??\u00a0</p><p>Winterfell is where we started our story. It is our home, our Hogwarts, we fought to get it back with Jon and Sansa and for Dany to mock it with no concern is plain infuriating.</p><p>Also, where and when did she become a manipulator? That scene was so disturbing, especially since Sansa grew up with Cersei, Tyrion, Littlefinger and the Tyrells. That hand back off was just\u2026it showed how insincere she is.</p><p>She isn\u2019t even bothered about Jon being her nephew, her sole concern is his claim being stronger than hers.\u00a0</p><p>Dany can see that she is losing foothold when she is used to being put on a pedestal. People are seeing how useless she really is in matters of politics and warfare and it scares her.</p><p>\u201cI take the Iron Throne.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>I have questions.</p><p>How will you rule? What then? What about the future? One that you have made bleak for you, how are you going to correct it?</p>",
