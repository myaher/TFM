To be fair, he kind of felt like that\nat the moment. It shouldn\u2019t be this hard. They lived in modern times, Tony was\na modern guy and Stephen should be able to just open his mouth and tell him\nthat he liked guys way more than girls.</p><!-- more --><p>That wasn\u2019t the\nproblem. He could do that, he\u2019d done it before. What he\u2019d never done before was\ngoing up to the object of his desire and tell <i>them</i> that he was\ninterested. All his other affairs with men - which were not that many, to be\nhonest, he\u2019d always been more concerned with his career than sex - had\napproached him, not the other way round. Despite all his precautions they\u2019d\nseen something in him, could tell his interest and acted on it. Sometimes it\nhad been great. Sometimes\u2026 not.</p><p>Fact was, Stephen\nStrange did not know how to flirt when he was seriously interested. A few\nharmless innuendos, not to be taken seriously, were no problem. He\u2019d winked at <i>Tony\nStark</i> after knowing the guy for about thirty minutes, for heaven\u2019s sake! He\ncould do cute banter and sarcastic quips with the best of them. Which was Tony,\nonce again.</p><p>\u201cStephen!\u201d\nWong broke through the endless circle of self-recrimination with a shout.\n\u201cIt\u2019s easy. You like Stark, he obviously likes you or he wouldn\u2019t keep you\naround or come over all the time.\u201d Despite the harsh words there was no\ncriticism in them; he liked Tony, after all, even though he tended to show it\nthrough sarcasm. A language both Tony and Stephen were fluent in. \u201cIt\u2019s no\nsecret that he likes girls <i>and</i> boys, so I really don\u2019t understand your\nproblem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t\nknow if he likes <i>me</i>.\u201d It was a clich\u00e9, yes, but Stephen really\nhadn\u2019t planned on speaking those words out aloud. He groaned, closed his eyes\nand finally sat down on the big library sofa. \u201cForget that I said\nthat.\u201d Even when he\u2019d <i>been </i>a teenager he hadn\u2019t felt like this. <i>This\nis how you know that it\u2019s the real thing.</i> He shoved the thought away,\nagain.</p><p>Wong laughed.\n\u201cNever,\u201d he said but he sounded kind about it. He sat down besides\nStephen and even went so far as to put an arm around him. Physical touch was\nunusual for them and Stephen leaned into it gratefully. \u201cBelieve me, he\nlikes you. If you weren\u2019t blind concerning him you\u2019d have seen it months ago.\nHe looks at you like you\u2019re personally responsible for the sun rising in the\nmorning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s kind\nof his thing, isn\u2019t it,\u201d Stephen muttered. \u201cSavior of the galaxy and\nall that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich he\ncouldn\u2019t have done without you. Just tell him. He\u2019s not going to run away and\nbanish you from his life forever.\u201d</p><p>Stephen shuddered.\nWong had put his fears into words. \u201cHe likes me as a friend, yes. But why\nshould he\u2026\u201d</p><p>Wong stopped him\nright there and then with a gentle whack to the head. \u201cStop it. I don\u2019t\nwant to hear it. Swallow your pride and tell him or stop pining after him like\nthe lovesick fool you are. It\u2019s getting tiresome.\u201d</p><p>*</p><p><i>I don\u2019t want to\nruin our friendship but I thought you should know\u2026</i></p><p>By the heavens,\nthis couldn\u2019t get any worse. In his mind he\u2019d tried pretty much every phrase\nand by now he had arrived at the stilted ones, straight out of some trashy\nmovie. <i>But at least they <b>work</b></i>, he thought and knew it that moment\nthat it was enough. Time to stop acting like a teenager and be himself.</p><p>The only problem\nwas that he just didn\u2019t know how to be himself anymore. Instead he was a\nnervous wreck; had been since the moment he finally realized that he\u2019d managed\nto fall for earth\u2019s greatest defender, also known as one of the suavest\nplayboys to ever grace the planet. In the same moment Stephen had lost every\nlast shred of his own composure and left behind was an insecure mess that\nwanted but didn\u2019t know how to ask for it. It was a new experience for him and\nhe hated it.</p><p>He\u2019d cancelled the\nlast few meetings with Tony last minute and by now the man probably thought\nthat <i>he\u2019d </i>made some faux-pas and that Stephen hated him. He\u2019d seen Tony\nspiral down into self-hate without much reason too often to not know that he\nwas not the only he person he was hurting with his behavior.</p><p>Time be himself;\nDoctor Stephen Strange, Master of the Mystic Arts and forty-three years old. He\ncould do this.</p><p>The Cloak\nfluttered behind him, as if to give him support.</p><p>*</p><p>His resolve had\nalmost left him again by the time he\u2019d opened the portal to the tower.</p><p>\u201cHello,\nStephen!\u201d At least FRIDAY sounded happy so see him and Stephen automatically\nsmiled at the nearest camera and nodded a greeting. The Cloak waved. \u201cBoss\nis in the living room. You\u2019ve got the authorization to just go through. He\u2019s\nwaiting.\u201d Stephen\u2019s spirits lifted.</p><p>He nodded his\nthanks, took a deep breath and went in search of Tony.</p><p>\u201cHi!\u201d\nTony, obviously told of his arrival by FRIDAY, smiled at him and Stephen felt\nthose mythical butterflies in his stomach. Tony\u2019s smile really could not only\nlight up a room but power the whole world for a week if he really meant it.\n\u201cYou made it! Great!\u201d</p><p>Stephen smiled\nback by reflex. \u201cHi. Yes. Sorry about that.\u201d Words were hard but he\nhoped that his expression showed his sincere happiness at being here. The Cloak\ngave him a little push to propel him a little bit nearer to Tony and he shushed\nit with an impatient gesture.</p><p>Tony, laughed,\nagain. \u201cTrouble with your cape?\u201d The Cloak, who was used to this kind\nof teasing, swatted at him, deliberately missing him. \u201cI must say that I\nlike the new look.\u201d His eyes wandered up and down Stephen\u2019s body, his\nintention clear, and Stephen couldn\u2019t help but <i>blush</i>. It was\nembarrassing. He was in normal clothes, just some old jeans and an even older\nshirt. They were from before the accident, before he\u2019d gained muscle mass, and\nwere a little bit on the tight side, but still comfortable. The outfit showed\noff two of his best attributes - his legs and his shoulders. At least that was\nwhat the Cloak had told him before it had decided to be his jacket for the\nevening.</p><p>A jacket that now\nfloated away to commune with FRIDAY, or whatever it did whenever they came over\nhere for an evening, and left Stephen just standing there, feeling exposed.</p><p><i>He likes you</i>, Wong had said. <i>And you\u2019re both idiots.</i> Considering the way Tony\nwas looking at him right now Stephen had to conclude that yes, he was an idiot,\nblinded by his own insecurities. He finally shrugged, still not knowing what he\nwas supposed to do, let alone say.</p><p>Tony finally came\nclose to him, reaching out with one hand. \u201cIf I may?\u201d He didn\u2019t even\nwait for an answer but stepped right up to Stephen and looked up. The height\ndifference wasn\u2019t that big but enough that Tony had to stretch a little and\nStephen had to bend down a little. <br/></p><p>Tony\u2019s hand landed\non his shoulder and stroked over the soft, worn material. \u201cVery nice,\u201d\nhe almost purred. He didn\u2019t mean the damn shirt and Stephen could feel the\nblush creep over his face and down his neck. \u201cAt first I didn\u2019t know what\nto make of your skittish behavior,\u201d he continued. Stephen wanted to\nprotest against that description but was too busy just breathing in Tony\u2019s\nwonderful scent. Besides, it wasn\u2019t untrue. \u201cBut then I began to think and\nresearch,\u201d Stephen shivered, he\u2019d seen Tony in one of this\nthink-and-research phases before and it was hot as hell. All that concentration,\nfocus and pure stubbornness focused on <i>him</i>? Tony thinking about him,\ncaring enough about him to dedicate time and effort? \u201cAnd ask questions.\nNot that you noticed, you were so fucking clueless I couldn\u2019t believe it. For a\ntime I even thought that you might not be interested. You\u2019re a master at giving\nmixed signals, Stephen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a gift.\nYou\u2019re not bad at them either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was just\ncopying the master.\u201d Tony\u2019s hand slowly wandered from his shoulder to his\nthroat - as if he <i>knew </i>just how much of a turn on that was for Stephen -\nand up to his face.</p><p>The sensual\ncontact finally broke through the numbness. He was a little bit hesitant but he\nbrought up a trembling hand to hold on to Tony before pulling him close for a\nkiss. <i>Finally</i>, he thought, before his brain went offline to concentrate\non other, more basic things.</p><p>=/\\=</p>",

It was\nembarrassing. He was in normal clothes, just some old jeans and an even older\nshirt. They were from before the accident, before he\u2019d gained muscle mass, and\nwere a little bit on the tight side, but still comfortable.

The height\ndifference wasn\u2019t that big but enough that Tony had to stretch a little and\nStephen had to bend down a little. <br></p><p>Tony\u2019s hand landed\non his shoulder and stroked over the soft, worn material. \u201cVery nice,\u201d\nhe almost purred. He didn\u2019t mean the damn shirt and Stephen could feel the\nblush creep over his face and down his neck. \u201cAt first I didn\u2019t know what\nto make of your skittish behavior,\u201d he continued. Stephen wanted to\nprotest against that description but was too busy just breathing in Tony\u2019s\nwonderful scent.

Instead he was a\nnervous wreck; had been since the moment he finally realized that he&rsquo;d managed\nto fall for earth&rsquo;s greatest defender, also known as one of the suavest\nplayboys to ever grace the planet. In the same moment Stephen had lost every\nlast shred of his own composure and left behind was an insecure mess that\nwanted but didn&rsquo;t know how to ask for it. It was a new experience for him and\nhe hated it.</p><p>He&rsquo;d cancelled the\nlast few meetings with Tony last minute and by now the man probably thought\nthat <i>he&rsquo;d </i>made some faux-pas and that Stephen hated him. He&rsquo;d seen Tony\nspiral down into self-hate without much reason too often to not know that he\nwas not the only he person he was hurting with his behavior.</p><p>Time be himself;\nDoctor Stephen Strange, Master of the Mystic Arts and forty-three years old. He\ncould do this.</p><p>The Cloak\nfluttered behind him, as if to give him support.</p><p>*</p><p>His resolve had\nalmost left him again by the time he&rsquo;d opened the portal to the tower.</p><p>&ldquo;Hello,\nStephen!&rdquo; At least FRIDAY sounded happy so see him and Stephen automatically\nsmiled at the nearest camera and nodded a greeting. The Cloak waved. &ldquo;Boss\nis in the living room. You&rsquo;ve got the authorization to just go through. He&rsquo;s\nwaiting.&rdquo; Stephen&rsquo;s spirits lifted.</p><p>He nodded his\nthanks, took a deep breath and went in search of Tony.</p><p>&ldquo;Hi!&rdquo;\nTony, obviously told of his arrival by FRIDAY, smiled at him and Stephen felt\nthose mythical butterflies in his stomach. Tony&rsquo;s smile really could not only\nlight up a room but power the whole world for a week if he really meant it.\n&ldquo;You made it! Great!&rdquo;</p><p>Stephen smiled\nback by reflex. &ldquo;Hi. Yes. Sorry about that.&rdquo; Words were hard but he\nhoped that his expression showed his sincere happiness at being here. The Cloak\ngave him a little push to propel him a little bit nearer to Tony and he shushed\nit with an impatient gesture.</p><p>Tony, laughed,\nagain. &ldquo;Trouble with your cape?&rdquo; The Cloak, who was used to this kind\nof teasing, swatted at him, deliberately missing him. &ldquo;I must say that I\nlike the new look.&rdquo; His eyes wandered up and down Stephen&rsquo;s body, his\nintention clear, and Stephen couldn&rsquo;t help but <i>blush</i>. It was\nembarrassing. He was in normal clothes, just some old jeans and an even older\nshirt. They were from before the accident, before he&rsquo;d gained muscle mass, and\nwere a little bit on the tight side, but still comfortable. The outfit showed\noff two of his best attributes - his legs and his shoulders. At least that was\nwhat the Cloak had told him before it had decided to be his jacket for the\nevening.</p><p>A jacket that now\nfloated away to commune with FRIDAY, or whatever it did whenever they came over\nhere for an evening, and left Stephen just standing there, feeling exposed.</p><p><i>He likes you</i>, Wong had said. <i>And you&rsquo;re both idiots.</i> Considering the way Tony\nwas looking at him right now Stephen had to conclude that yes, he was an idiot,\nblinded by his own insecurities. He finally shrugged, still not knowing what he\nwas supposed to do, let alone say.</p><p>Tony finally came\nclose to him, reaching out with one hand. &ldquo;If I may?&rdquo; He didn&rsquo;t even\nwait for an answer but stepped right up to Stephen and looked up. The height\ndifference wasn&rsquo;t that big but enough that Tony had to stretch a little and\nStephen had to bend down a little. <br /></p><p>Tony&rsquo;s hand landed\non his shoulder and stroked over the soft, worn material. &ldquo;Very nice,&rdquo;\nhe almost purred. He didn&rsquo;t mean the damn shirt and Stephen could feel the\nblush creep over his face and down his neck. &ldquo;At first I didn&rsquo;t know what\nto make of your skittish behavior,&rdquo; he continued. Stephen wanted to\nprotest against that description but was too busy just breathing in Tony&rsquo;s\nwonderful scent. Besides, it wasn&rsquo;t untrue. &ldquo;But then I began to think and\nresearch,&rdquo; Stephen shivered, he&rsquo;d seen Tony in one of this\nthink-and-research phases before and it was hot as hell. All that concentration,\nfocus and pure stubbornness focused on <i>him</i>? Tony thinking about him,\ncaring enough about him to dedicate time and effort? &ldquo;And ask questions.\nNot that you noticed, you were so fucking clueless I couldn&rsquo;t believe it. For a\ntime I even thought that you might not be interested. You&rsquo;re a master at giving\nmixed signals, Stephen.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a gift.\nYou&rsquo;re not bad at them either.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I was just\ncopying the master.&rdquo; Tony&rsquo;s hand slowly wandered from his shoulder to his\nthroat - as if he <i>knew </i>just how much of a turn on that was for Stephen -\nand up to his face.</p><p>The sensual\ncontact finally broke through the numbness. He was a little bit hesitant but he\nbrought up a trembling hand to hold on to Tony before pulling him close for a\nkiss. <i>Finally</i>, he thought, before his brain went offline to concentrate\non other, more basic things.</p><p>=/\\=</p>",

Happy end and all that.

Stop running around like a squirrel. Second? <i>Tell him.</i>&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Wong, the original\nunmovable object, just stood there, arms crossed, and looked at Stephen as if\nhe were the greatest idiot of all times. To be fair, he kind of felt like that\nat the moment. It shouldn&rsquo;t be this hard. They lived in modern times, Tony was\na modern guy and Stephen should be able to just open his mouth and tell him\nthat he liked guys way more than girls.</p>\n</p>",
