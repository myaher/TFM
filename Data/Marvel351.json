I speak Finnish and English (obviously), and seeing as I'm from Finland I do know some Swedish too (we have to study it in school). I am studying Russian in school as well, and I get all the languages I know mixed up all the goddamn time. I like writing and drawing and epic music, and also castles and stuff. And APH Russia. I love him. I also love my six doggies. c: And also Toothless from HTTYD, he is precious and adorable. And also Detective Conan! I love that series too. And also MCU! Especially Thor (mostly during and after Ragnarok tho) and Loki (because I love me some mythology and also family feels), but I honestly cannot think of a character I dislike?? Except Thanos. Hate him. And I also like Cells at Work! Platelets are preciousz though I am boring and gonna say my faves from that show are Red Blood Cell and White Blood Cell, you know, the more or less man characters? Yesss. And Noragami! I also like Noragami! Guess I just like stories with gods?? I have a god OC too, or a goddess. She's an original creation, older than my being a Noragami or MCU fan. She doesn't have a name so I call her the Asshole Goddess, because she is a goddess, and also an asshole. I also like Brooklyn 99! i just binged the whole series!  My profile picture is my dog, Cara, she is a Staffordshire Bull Terrier, and I love her veeeeery much.",

        "body": "<h1>IronWing: Vows and Proposals (pt.2/2) </h1><p>I was back in her courtroom. Silverwing was back, sat on her throne of metal and bone spikes. </p><p>She sat motionless before me, which each arm resting on either side of her chair. It stunk or iron and sulphur in the room, and a mist filtered into covering the dirt floor. </p><p>&ldquo;What is this?!&rdquo; I asked, confused. We should&rsquo;ve been transported back to K'un lun, but yet we&rsquo;re still here. </p><p>&ldquo;As i said, Ironfist, no one leaves. Especially not me&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the jewel?&rdquo; </p><p>She sat there in silence. She wasn&rsquo;t going to make this easy. But for the life of me i couldnt understand why. Until&hellip; </p><p>&ldquo;Mephisto. He won&rsquo;t let you leave will he. You guard the jewel, because you cant leave i&rsquo;m guessing.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Yes, and now neither can you. You really think you&rsquo;re the only one who&rsquo;s come looking for it. Its quite a powerful gem! Has lots of attributes to it too. Did you know that?&rdquo; </p><p>I felt like i was being twisted in her grasp. This was a game. One it seemed i would have to play after all. </p><p>&ldquo;No. So, what are you going to do with me then? In your little scene of yours you handed me over to mephisto. Is that what you&rsquo;re going to do?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;No. But i can&rsquo;t leave and neither can you.&rdquo; </p><p>Slowly it started to come together. She was afraid. Others had come for the stone before, and learned that she guards it. And that she wont let them have what they want, because she cant have what she wants. To leave this place. So no doubt others have tried to take her out by killing her or attempting to. And then theres me, telling her i wanted to rescue her, but that i needed the jewel first. </p><p>Her fear is her hope. </p><p>&ldquo;Okay. So you guard the jewel. And you wont let me leave with it. Correct?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;What if we leave it behind and we still go.&rdquo;</p><p>She leans forward with direct soul-piercing eye contact. Please let this work! </p><p>&ldquo;But you need it.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I can live without it. But you, you dont want to be here. I can tell, you&rsquo;re trapped here. You&rsquo;re more important.&rdquo; </p><p>She leans back and angrily hisses at me. </p><p>&ldquo;LIES!!&rdquo; </p><p>Crap! Time for plan b! I charge over to her and grab her hand and drag her away. She fights me. </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a lie! It&rsquo;s what i do!&rdquo; </p><p>She rears back and screeches at me like banshee. She&rsquo;s pissed as hell, which is ironic considering where we were. I&rsquo;m then launched into the air and she springs up after me and kicks me back to the ground. I land hard! It hurts like a bitch! </p><p>I try to get up, but before i can stand she grabs my arm and flings me away, this time its a rock face wall that comes to greet me instead of the floor. As i sink down, she&rsquo;s there below me on the ground, grabbing my foot she pulls me down and drags me inside a cave. </p><p>Wait&hellip; What?! </p><p>Inside it shimmers from the portal. The ground starts to rumble, i look up out of the cave and see figures in the further distance stampeding towards us yelling. Oh holy crap! </p><p>&ldquo;YOU REALLY CANT LEAVE CAN YOU!&rdquo; i shout at her! Everything comes rushing into my brain with crystal clear clarity. She or the jewel cant leave - if they do - hell will be raised. </p><p>&ldquo;THIS IS WHAT IS KEEPING THEM HERE! KEEPING THEM FROM ENTERING THE MORTAL COIL, ISNT IT?!&rdquo; </p><p>she comes face to face with me, her eyes open wide in mad terror, strands of her red hair plastered to the skin on her face. She was scared, alright. Just not from me or what i represent to her. But that she cant leave no matter how much she wants to. She&rsquo;s anchored here, not just by the jewel, but by all of hell. They wont let her go. </p><p>&ldquo;Even if i ever found a way to escape, where have i to go?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I told you, im here to take you back to my land.&rdquo; </p><p>A sharp laugh escapes her mouth. &ldquo;Heaven?! Do you really think i would be allowed in? And even if they did, why the hell would they want me there?&rdquo; </p><p>The rumbling gets louder and i can hear their threats and calls to her. </p><p>&ldquo;Because you dont belong here.&rdquo; </p><p>Locked eye to eye, face to face, we came to an understanding. With the ground unsteady beneath my feet i rose, grabbed her hand and pulled us into the portal. </p><p>This time we landed where we needed to be. I quickly got up and leapt over the line of sand we had laid down before my trip. </p><p>Silverwing is still a demon and one that cannot be trusted. She&rsquo;s a killer and needs to be contained. </p><p>Over the line, the barrier comes up forming a mystical dome over where she laid. Slowly she comes to and looks around. Realization fills her mind, she still wasnt free. She cant be ever be free, because shes too dangerous. </p><p>&ldquo;Silverwing, welcome to K'un Lun! I am Lei Kung, the Thunderer and champion of K'un Lun.&rdquo; </p><p>She thrashes against the walls of the dome, but she cannot break through, its painful to watch. </p><p>&ldquo;Dont worry Danny, she&rsquo;s fine.&rdquo; Lei tells me. </p><p>&ldquo;Silverwing! You have been brought here as part of a prophecy. United with Ironfist, you will help to bring peace and prosperity to the land and people of K'un Lun. You will live here now and become a champion to the people, you will help in the fight against our enemies. Let us begin that journey&rdquo; </p><p>Lei turns away from the screaming, bashing silverwing in her mystical dome containment, to a table with a wooden box with symbolic writing on the top. He brings it back towards her. </p><p>&ldquo;In this box is the future for both of you. The seers have foretold the circumstances surrounding this prophecy, and it requires some conditions. Silverwing-&rdquo; </p><p>He opens the box and brings out a navy blue ribbon and throws it on top of the dome, as it slides down, he speaks&hellip; </p><p>&ldquo;-from this moment you will no longer be permitted from harming any innocent. Upon doing so you will be forced back into hell, where you will remain trapped. Do you understand?&rdquo; </p><p>She quietens down, low to the ground, she growls, avoiding to look at us. </p><p>The ribbon filters through the barrier and disintegrates above her, raining down a powder onto her exposed skin. She flinches and hisses. </p><p>Lei turns to face me. </p><p>&ldquo;Danny, this is not just about her, this also involves you. You need to take care of her. And this, according to the seers, requires you to be connected by marriage to her. You need to take her into your home as a wife.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;WHAT?!&rdquo; </p><p>nah-uh, no way was i going to do that. She&rsquo;d killed me before even got to the threshold! </p><p>&ldquo;SHE&rsquo;LL KILL ME!! NOT TO MENTION I DONT WANT TO GET MARRIED! DO I LOOK THE MARRYING TYPE?! WHY?! WHY DO I HAVE TO DO THIS?! WHY DO &lsquo;WE&rsquo; HAVE TO DO THIS?! I MEAN, SURELY WE CAN JUST BE FIGHTING PARTNERS AT THE VERY LEAST! BUT NOT MARRIED, PLEASE!!&rdquo; </p><p>I&rsquo;m desperate at this point, i look around at the other monks, at my friends and people i consider family and all of then give me firm, stern looks. Married?! Why?! </p><p>&ldquo;Calm down! It&rsquo;s just marriage, youre more than capable of maintaining one. Marriage is a partnership, one that is based on trust and harmony. The fact that she is here, shows that that is there already between you. Just need to give her a chance to show you&hellip;although&hellip;it may take time. This unity the prophecy talks about is important! You know enemies against us are mounting, and you need a partner. She is it!&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;No! She&rsquo;s evil and tricky and&hellip;did i mention the evil part?!&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;There is more to her than meets the eye. Teach her about peace and harmony. Teach her things she would never have known about in hell. I&rsquo;m afraid you have no choice in this matter. You are Ironfist, you chose to sacrifice your life for this land and its people. This is a part of it. Now&hellip;take the end of this bit of string&hellip;&rdquo; </p><p>It&rsquo;s just an ordinary stone coloured woven bit of cotton string. But to me, it felt like holding my bit of doomed fate. </p><p>&ldquo;Silvering-&rdquo; </p><p>She groans and i feel it too. </p><p>&ldquo;You are to be joined with Ironfist as part of your new life here. He will treat you with dignity and respect. You will live with him in his home, which shall also be yours now. Where he goes, you go too. If either of you stray from each others presence you both will be pulled back here, never to travel outside the land again. If ironfist is killed before his natural time, you will be sent back into hell - his life is your responsibility. Just as your life is his responsibility. Now hold this end of the string for the marriage ritual to be completed&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;This isnt normally how marriage rituals are completed.&rdquo; This is unusual and confusing, normally theres colourful customes and food and drink and music and happy people. Theres none of that right now. </p><p>&ldquo;This is different. This is a marriage of necessity, not love.&rdquo; </p><p>Silvering pipes up and croaks &ldquo;Forced.&rdquo; </p><p>She takes the other part of the string which slips through the barrier, shattering the dome, setting her free of the containment. </p><p>We stand face to face. She has a hard expression on her face which mirrors my sense of defeat. I&rsquo;m reminded that my life is not my own. I gave it away a long time ago. And that was my choice. And this, this is just a part of it i must accept. </p>",

This unity the prophecy talks about is important! You know enemies against us are mounting, and you need a partner. She is it!\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo! She\u2019s evil and tricky and\u2026did i mention the evil part?!\u201d </p><p>\u201cThere is more to her than meets the eye. Teach her about peace and harmony. Teach her things she would never have known about in hell. I\u2019m afraid you have no choice in this matter. You are Ironfist, you chose to sacrifice your life for this land and its people. This is a part of it. Now\u2026take the end of this bit of string\u2026\u201d </p><p>It\u2019s just an ordinary stone coloured woven bit of cotton string. But to me, it felt like holding my bit of doomed fate. </p><p>\u201cSilvering-\u201d </p><p>She groans and i feel it too. </p><p>\u201cYou are to be joined with Ironfist as part of your new life here. He will treat you with dignity and respect. You will live with him in his home, which shall also be yours now. Where he goes, you go too. If either of you stray from each others presence you both will be pulled back here, never to travel outside the land again. If ironfist is killed before his natural time, you will be sent back into hell - his life is your responsibility. Just as your life is his responsibility. Now hold this end of the string for the marriage ritual to be completed\u201d </p><p>\u201cThis isnt normally how marriage rituals are completed.\u201d This is unusual and confusing, normally theres colourful customes and food and drink and music and happy people. Theres none of that right now. </p><p>\u201cThis is different. This is a marriage of necessity, not love.\u201d </p><p>Silvering pipes up and croaks \u201cForced.\u201d </p><p>She takes the other part of the string which slips through the barrier, shattering the dome, setting her free of the containment. </p><p>We stand face to face. She has a hard expression on her face which mirrors my sense of defeat. I\u2019m reminded that my life is not my own. I gave it away a long time ago. And that was my choice. And this, this is just a part of it i must accept. </p></p>",

Silverwing was back, sat on her throne of metal and bone spikes. </p><p>She sat motionless before me, which each arm resting on either side of her chair. It stunk or iron and sulphur in the room, and a mist filtered into covering the dirt floor. </p><p>\u201cWhat is this?!\u201d I asked, confused. We should\u2019ve been transported back to K'un lun, but yet we\u2019re still here. </p><p>\u201cAs i said, Ironfist, no one leaves. Especially not me\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s the jewel?\u201d </p><p>She sat there in silence. She wasn\u2019t going to make this easy. But for the life of me i couldnt understand why. Until\u2026 </p><p>\u201cMephisto. He won\u2019t let you leave will he. You guard the jewel, because you cant leave i\u2019m guessing.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYes, and now neither can you. You really think you\u2019re the only one who\u2019s come looking for it. Its quite a powerful gem! Has lots of attributes to it too. Did you know that?\u201d </p><p>I felt like i was being twisted in her grasp. This was a game. One it seemed i would have to play after all. </p><p>\u201cNo. So, what are you going to do with me then? In your little scene of yours you handed me over to mephisto. Is that what you\u2019re going to do?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo. But i can\u2019t leave and neither can you.\u201d </p><p>Slowly it started to come together. She was afraid. Others had come for the stone before, and learned that she guards it. And that she wont let them have what they want, because she cant have what she wants. To leave this place. So no doubt others have tried to take her out by killing her or attempting to. And then theres me, telling her i wanted to rescue her, but that i needed the jewel first. </p><p>Her fear is her hope. </p><p>\u201cOkay. So you guard the jewel. And you wont let me leave with it. Correct?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhat if we leave it behind and we still go.\u201d</p><p>She leans forward with direct soul-piercing eye contact. Please let this work! </p><p>\u201cBut you need it.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI can live without it. But you, you dont want to be here. I can tell, you\u2019re trapped here. You\u2019re more important.\u201d </p><p>She leans back and angrily hisses at me. </p><p>\u201cLIES!!\u201d </p><p>Crap! Time for plan b! I charge over to her and grab her hand and drag her away. She fights me. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a lie! It\u2019s what i do!\u201d </p><p>She rears back and screeches at me like banshee. She\u2019s pissed as hell, which is ironic considering where we were. I\u2019m then launched into the air and she springs up after me and kicks me back to the ground. I land hard! It hurts like a bitch! </p><p>I try to get up, but before i can stand she grabs my arm and flings me away, this time its a rock face wall that comes to greet me instead of the floor. As i sink down, she\u2019s there below me on the ground, grabbing my foot she pulls me down and drags me inside a cave. </p><p>Wait\u2026 What?! </p><p>Inside it shimmers from the portal. The ground starts to rumble, i look up out of the cave and see figures in the further distance stampeding towards us yelling. Oh holy crap! </p><p>\u201cYOU REALLY CANT LEAVE CAN YOU!\u201d i shout at her! Everything comes rushing into my brain with crystal clear clarity. She or the jewel cant leave - if they do - hell will be raised. </p><p>\u201cTHIS IS WHAT IS KEEPING THEM HERE! KEEPING THEM FROM ENTERING THE MORTAL COIL, ISNT IT?!\u201d </p><p>she comes face to face with me, her eyes open wide in mad terror, strands of her red hair plastered to the skin on her face. She was scared, alright. Just not from me or what i represent to her. But that she cant leave no matter how much she wants to. She\u2019s anchored here, not just by the jewel, but by all of hell. They wont let her go. </p><p>\u201cEven if i ever found a way to escape, where have i to go?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI told you, im here to take you back to my land.\u201d </p><p>A sharp laugh escapes her mouth. \u201cHeaven?! Do you really think i would be allowed in? And even if they did, why the hell would they want me there?\u201d </p><p>The rumbling gets louder and i can hear their threats and calls to her. </p><p>\u201cBecause you dont belong here.\u201d </p><p>Locked eye to eye, face to face, we came to an understanding. With the ground unsteady beneath my feet i rose, grabbed her hand and pulled us into the portal. </p><p>This time we landed where we needed to be. I quickly got up and leapt over the line of sand we had laid down before my trip. </p><p>Silverwing is still a demon and one that cannot be trusted. She\u2019s a killer and needs to be contained. </p><p>Over the line, the barrier comes up forming a mystical dome over where she laid. Slowly she comes to and looks around. Realization fills her mind, she still wasnt free. She cant be ever be free, because shes too dangerous. </p><p>\u201cSilverwing, welcome to K'un Lun! I am Lei Kung, the Thunderer and champion of K'un Lun.\u201d </p><p>She thrashes against the walls of the dome, but she cannot break through, its painful to watch. </p><p>\u201cDont worry Danny, she\u2019s fine.\u201d Lei tells me. </p><p>\u201cSilverwing! You have been brought here as part of a prophecy. United with Ironfist, you will help to bring peace and prosperity to the land and people of K'un Lun. You will live here now and become a champion to the people, you will help in the fight against our enemies. Let us begin that journey\u201d </p><p>Lei turns away from the screaming, bashing silverwing in her mystical dome containment, to a table with a wooden box with symbolic writing on the top. He brings it back towards her. </p><p>\u201cIn this box is the future for both of you. The seers have foretold the circumstances surrounding this prophecy, and it requires some conditions. Silverwing-\u201d </p><p>He opens the box and brings out a navy blue ribbon and throws it on top of the dome, as it slides down, he speaks\u2026 </p><p>\u201c-from this moment you will no longer be permitted from harming any innocent. Upon doing so you will be forced back into hell, where you will remain trapped. Do you understand?\u201d </p><p>She quietens down, low to the ground, she growls, avoiding to look at us. </p><p>The ribbon filters through the barrier and disintegrates above her, raining down a powder onto her exposed skin. She flinches and hisses. </p><p>Lei turns to face me. </p><p>\u201cDanny, this is not just about her, this also involves you. You need to take care of her. And this, according to the seers, requires you to be connected by marriage to her. You need to take her into your home as a wife.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWHAT?!\u201d </p><p>nah-uh, no way was i going to do that. She\u2019d killed me before even got to the threshold! </p><p>\u201cSHE\u2019LL KILL ME!! NOT TO MENTION I DONT WANT TO GET MARRIED! DO I LOOK THE MARRYING TYPE?! WHY?! WHY DO I HAVE TO DO THIS?! WHY DO \u2018WE\u2019 HAVE TO DO THIS?! I MEAN, SURELY WE CAN JUST BE FIGHTING PARTNERS AT THE VERY LEAST! BUT NOT MARRIED, PLEASE!!\u201d </p><p>I\u2019m desperate at this point, i look around at the other monks, at my friends and people i consider family and all of then give me firm, stern looks. Married?! Why?! </p><p>\u201cCalm down! It\u2019s just marriage, youre more than capable of maintaining one. Marriage is a partnership, one that is based on trust and harmony. The fact that she is here, shows that that is there already between you. Just need to give her a chance to show you\u2026although\u2026it may take time.
