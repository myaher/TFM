Nothing angsty, just <span class=\"npf_color_niles\">pure fluff</span>.</b></p><p><b>This is my first piece of writing in months, so please be kind! I&rsquo;m still trying to get back into the swing of it, so feel free to send me requests.</b></p><p><b>I also posted this to my <a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Farchiveofourown.org%2Fusers%2Fhoneyflowers%2Fpseuds%2Fhoneyflowers&amp;t=NjBjMTcyMzAxNDA4YWVmMjA3YWVlOTUwYjA4YWIwNTIxY2IxY2FjNCw5Njg5YmI2MTQ1NjlkZjhlYzE3YzdjNDI2NjJhYzAxMTZmMjVhMTZh\">ao3</a>, so perhaps leave me some feedback or kudos on there too? It&rsquo;s much appreciated &lt;3</b></p><p>Stumbling into the hallway, you carelessly slammed the door behind you and let out a sigh of relief. It had been yet another long, tiresome day at work, and the bus rolling up almost forty minutes late did nothing to improve your lousy mood. Tugging off your jacket, you trudged into the lounge where Carol was curled up on the couch, the chalky white blanket you bought as last year&rsquo;s Christmas gift wrapped around her shoulders. She had been avidly watching a game show on the television screen in front of her but after hearing the sound of your footsteps, she tilted her head towards you and gave a warm smile.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, sweetie. Bad day?&rdquo;</p><p>You nodded, tossing your jacket onto the back of the couch. &ldquo;So many people testing my patience today. I almost broke down into tears in the bathroom during my shift.&rdquo;</p><p>Carol held out her arms. &ldquo;Come cuddle,&rdquo; she said gently.</p><p>You sat down on the couch as Carol shifted along to give you space. Kicking off your shoes, you tucked your feet behind you as Carol wrapped her arms around you, bringing you closer. A soft kiss was placed on your head and you allowed yourself to relax for the first time that day as you leaned in to your girlfriend&rsquo;s warm touch.</p><p>&ldquo;Want to talk about it?&rdquo; she asked, carefully running her hands through your hair.</p><p>&ldquo;Not really,&rdquo; you mumbled. &ldquo;Just need to be here with you.&rdquo;</p><p>You laid your head on her chest and closed your eyes, feeling her steady heartbeat against your cheek. Carol slipped her hand into yours, lightly stroking your fingers.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, guess what.&rdquo;</p><p>You looked up, watching a playful smile appear on her face. &ldquo;What?&rdquo; you grinned.</p><p>&ldquo;I bought you something today. Thought you might like it.&rdquo;</p><p>Carol reached behind the couch and pulled out a box of cookies, adorned with a dainty pink ribbon. &ldquo;Monica had these the other week and shared them with me. I was gonna bring some home for you but we finished the lot.&rdquo;</p><p>A warmth spread across your cheeks. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re too kind. Thank you, honey.&rdquo;</p><p>Carol beamed. &ldquo;Glad it cheered you up.&rdquo;</p><p>You carefully pulled the ribbon, unravelling it slowly. Lifting the lid, you set your eyes on the various gaps in the box where a number of cookies appeared to be missing.</p><p>&ldquo;How many of these have you eaten already?&rdquo; you laughed, turning to Carol. She ducked her head down, trying to hide her smirk.</p><p>&ldquo;I might&rsquo;ve opened the box before you got home,&rdquo; she replied, fiddling with her hands. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t help it.&rdquo;</p><p>You giggled in response, setting the box aside and lifting her face to meet yours. &ldquo;I appreciate the thought.&rdquo;</p><p>Carol smiled once more, her eyes bright as she gazed at you with adoration. Leaning in, you brought your lips to hers in a tender kiss, feeling the familiar sensation of butterflies spread through your stomach. Hands clasped together, you could stay in this moment for hours.</p><p>&ldquo;I love you,&rdquo; you murmured, gently brushing your fingers against Carol&rsquo;s cheek.</p><p>&ldquo;I love you too.&rdquo;</p></p>",

Through this, we learn that Carol never came back to Earth after leaving to help the Skrulls find a new homeworld.

Carol visits the Rambeau family home and we see that it\u2019s been long abandoned. As she\u2019s inspecting the house, a group of Skrull soldiers arrive, led by the Super-Skrull making his MCU debut (his origins will be explored in a Fantastic Four movie). Super-Skrull says that\u00a0Carol broke her promise to both the Kree and the Skrulls by returning to Earth, once in 2018 to save Tony Stark and Nebula, and then again in 2023 to fight Thanos. Through this, we learn that Carol was banned/exiled.\u00a0</p><p>Carol says she had to come back to Earth in order to save the universe, despite knowing that by doing so, she\u2019d be punished. The Skrulls, despite respecting her for what she did for their people and understanding that Thanos needed to be defeated, says that she still has to pay for breaking her promise.</p><p>A fight occurs and Carol reluctantly battles the Skrulls. The fight ends with Carol getting stabbed in the back by the Super-Skrull, who says to her, \u201cthis isn\u2019t personal\u201d. The Skrulls then leave her to bleed to death. As she\u2019s passing out from blood loss, a group of civilians arrive and try to save her. She then starts hallucinating the civilians as her loved ones and we get another look at Carol\u2019s state of mind through how her hallucinations speak to her.</p><p>1) The Talos hallucination says he\u2019s grateful for what she did for his people and that he\u2019s sorry that future generations of the Skrulls let her down. He says that there are no clear heroes or villains in war and he\u2019s sorry that Carol had to learn that the hard way during the Kree-Skrull War.\u00a0</p><p>2) The Maria Rambeau and Monica Rambeau hallucinations are angry that Carol left them and never came back home.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>3) The Nick Fury hallucination says to Carol that the superhero life requires sacrifice and that she was foolish for thinking she could end the Kree-Skrull War without sacrificing something important to her (hinting at the reason why she was exiled from Earth).</p><p>When the hallucinations disappear, the screen starts to fade to black as Carol blacks out from blood loss.

Nick Fury is there and Carol talks about what happened in the past and the reasons why she never came home.
