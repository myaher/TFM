        "body": "<h1>Second chances (Ironstrange omegaverse headcanons)</h1><p>1.Tony was a beautiful, sweet, little omega, in his youth there came in many marriage proposals for him, but he only wanted to marry Steve. They met in a park once, and against the approval of his parents, Tony married Steve at a young age 24. Little did he know Steve was not the man he thought he was.</p><p>2.Things started getting worse and worse as days passed&hellip; Steve was a stereotypical alpha with too high an ego and too many expectations, Tony tried.. He really did, but complains remained, the food was never good enough, the clothes were never clean enough, he was not being attentive.. And with each disappointment of a day came slaps and harsh sounds of belt hitting skin, and immense amount of verbal abuse. Abuse increased day and night, but Tony didn&rsquo;t want to go back to his parents&hellip;. Because he knew they would say &ldquo;why did you marry him in the first place, when we forbide you?&rdquo;. Then came the day Tony broke the news of his pregnancy to Steve, that made him happy&hellip; He even was little more considerate with Tony after that, but good things don&rsquo;t last that long with Tony. Tony was cleaning the dishes, when Steve slammed open the door, drunk and angry&hellip;. Tony suffered grievous injuries that day, and he also lost his child at his 5th month of gestation. After these events Steve divorced him claiming he was feeble and suffered from some disease which is why they lost the baby&hellip; And that fact was hidden from him during the wedding or else he would not have married this Omega.</p><p>3. Tony&rsquo;s suffering didn&rsquo;t end there, his Father did even more emotional damage to him, saying who would marry him now .. He was a disgrace to the family. Tony would lay on his bed, crying as days turned into nights &hellip; And Dawn turned to dusk&hellip; He would cry for his lost child. 3years laters a letter arrived from the matrimonial agency claiming that they found Tony a suitor, and the person didn&rsquo;t care if he was divorced.</p><p>4. His mother called him for his opinion, trying to hand him over the suitors picture, too which his Father only retorted saying let him not make the decision, that&rsquo;s better&hellip; We all know what happened last time. Tony lowered his gaze, didn&rsquo;t even glace at the photo, he just said&quot;Whatever you find appropriate father&quot;, tears moistened his eyes, he went back to his room and let them fall. </p><p>5. He wore a veil which was quite thick and he couldn&rsquo;t really see much through it while standing next to his fiancee, as the priest started officiating the wedding. Tony felt nothing but anxiety, he spent 3years in abuse with the Alpha he loved&hellip;. If that was the treatment, how would this marriage go? It had no attachment to begin with, he didn&rsquo;t even know how this person called Dr.Stephen Strange looked like&hellip; The name Stephen itself have him shivers. His thoughts were cut off my a baritone voice whispering to him, &ldquo;Are you scared?&rdquo; , &ldquo;A little&rdquo; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s ok to scared, it&rsquo;s our wedding&hellip;. In all reality, marriage itself is a scary concept&rdquo;. The comment made Tony giggle a little.</p><p>6. The time came when the priest finally said, now you may kiss your mate. Stephen slowly lifted the veil, Tony kept his eyes closed till the veil was lifted off completely, and then only opened his eyes, to see his husband&hellip;.. At that very moment his heart skipped a beat and then it ran like a race horse, cheeks got dusted with pink aura as ocean blue-green eyes gazed at him with a soft smile on his husband&rsquo;s cupid lips, grey streaks of hair proudly stood out at the temples giving him a beautifully sophisticated look. Stephen slowly lowered his mouth, he was quite tall for Tony&hellip; Tony could feel arms wrap around his waist, he himself pressed his hands on his husband&rsquo;s chest as he softly started to close his eyes awaiting the kiss, he could feel a brush of nose and then warm lips around his own. It was a blissful feeling.</p><p>7. Even at the night of the wedding as they consummated their marriage, and Stephen marked Tony, he didn&rsquo;t feel any pain&hellip; As Stephen bit down over Steve&rsquo;s ugly big mark, there was hardly any pain, Tony felt more intoxicating. Along the night came soft kisses, sweet words, soft touches and gentle, very gentle love making.</p><p>8. Stephen was a caring alpha, Tony noticed that.. He wasn&rsquo;t very good at expressing things with words, so he was more likely to use gestures&hellip; Also Tony tried extra hard this time, but he slowly realized that Stephen didn&rsquo;t have the same demands as Steve did. He didn&rsquo;t want Tony to feel dominated either, always taking in consideration of his opinions, bringing back Tony&rsquo;s favorite flowers when coming home, surprising Tony with movie tickets and all that soft love-making and cuddles&hellip; Also he would receive a kiss before Stephen left for the hospital, and another after he came back.</p><p>9. Tony couldn&rsquo;t help but feel joy when Stephen asked if he would like to take a job, he was so supportive of it&hellip; And Tony joined defense development research dept, marking droids for the intelligence agencies. Stephen was proud and Tony was just happy that he was being cuddled. Stephen&rsquo;s expression was hilarious when Tony told him he was pregnant, he stared at him for like a 100years, then suddenly Tony&rsquo;s happy squeals were heard around the house as Stephen picked him up, spinning them in circles, Tony received at least a 1000 thousand kisses on his face that day.</p><p>10. Stephen should have known better, he should not have brought Karl Mordo in his house, that man was extremely sexist, he berated Tony for dropping the tea cup, and when Stephen didn&rsquo;t say anything to Tony, he started saying how he couldn&rsquo;t control his Omega, how a tight slap in his cheek would refrain from further mistakes, Tony dashed out of the room, he was shaking as he slowly  collapsed on the kitchen floor, he could hear Stephen&rsquo;s angry voice and a heated conservation, he didn&rsquo;t understand it at all .. His mind was to blank out of fear, he covered his baby bump with his arms,tears were running down his cheeks &hellip;. &ldquo;Tony&rdquo; he heard Stephen&rsquo;s voice, it sounded angry &hellip;&lsquo;No&hellip; No.. This couldn&rsquo;t happen again. Not again.. God no please .. Have mercy&rsquo;&hellip;. Tony started crying &ldquo;No alpha no ..please no&rdquo;, crouching into a fetal position on the floor&hellip;&ldquo;please&hellip; It won&rsquo;t happen again&hellip; Please mercy alpha.. I&rsquo;ll lose my baby again&hellip; My baby will die.. please no..&rdquo; </p><p>11. Stephen stared horrified at his beloved omega, is that what Tony thought of him? Suddenly a bad feeling originated in his gut&hellip; He didn&rsquo;t waste anymore time, he picked up his crying omega, went straight to the bedroom, where he sat down with Tony across his lap &hellip; soothing him, telling him&hellip; He was safe with him and he would never hurt him or their child, rubbing his hands softly on Tony&rsquo;s baby bump. Tony finally stopped cried, only small sobs and whimpers came in a few minutes. &ldquo;Shhhh my love, ignore Mordo, he&rsquo;s a jerk&hellip;. Listen to me..I love you and our baby, I wouldn&rsquo;t hurt you&rdquo; &ldquo;S-S-sorry Alpha&rdquo; &ldquo;sshh, Tony, will you tell me something if I ask you?&rdquo; Tony nodded face buried in his neck. &ldquo;When your parents mentioned your miscarriage in the previous marriage, it wasn&rsquo;t really because of any hormonal disproportion or natural cause, was it?&rdquo; Tony froze for a while&hellip; Then he wailed into Stephen&rsquo;s neck&hellip; Crying, clutching at him, holding onto him as if Stephen would disappear&hellip;&ldquo; I&hellip;I.. Steve&hellip; He&hellip;.ahhhhhhhAaaaaa&rdquo; &ldquo;Shhhh&hellip; It&rsquo;s ok ok .. You don&rsquo;t have to say .. You don&rsquo;t need to use your words&rdquo; Stephen soothed him as he fell asleep crying.</p><p>12. Tony woke up to soft whispers and a careful rubbing on his bump as the baby kicked&hellip; He opened to his eyes to see Stephen leaned towards his bumps, talking to the baby&hellip;&ldquo; Who&rsquo;s Daddy&rsquo;s Little sweetheart? You&rsquo;re .yes.. You are&hellip; Now now let&rsquo;s not kick too hard, or else you&rsquo;ll wake up your papa, he needs rest doesn&rsquo;t he now sweetheart&rdquo; Tony felt warmth spread around his chest as he saw all this happen. Stephen seemed to sense his movement, he now moved towards Tony, kissing him on the cheek&hellip; Tony gazed at him.. And his mouth automatically spoke &ldquo;I love you&rdquo;.. Stephen smiled widely at that, and kissed his forehead&hellip;&ldquo; Time will tell you my love, how much I love you&rdquo;</p>",

Tony lowered his gaze, didn\u2019t even glace at the photo, he just said\"Whatever you find appropriate father\", tears moistened his eyes, he went back to his room and let them fall. </p><p>5. He wore a veil which was quite thick and he couldn\u2019t really see much through it while standing next to his fiancee, as the priest started officiating the wedding. Tony felt nothing but anxiety, he spent 3years in abuse with the Alpha he loved\u2026. If that was the treatment, how would this marriage go? It had no attachment to begin with, he didn\u2019t even know how this person called Dr.Stephen Strange looked like\u2026 The name Stephen itself have him shivers. His thoughts were cut off my a baritone voice whispering to him, \u201cAre you scared?\u201d , \u201cA little\u201d \u201cit\u2019s ok to scared, it\u2019s our wedding\u2026. In all reality, marriage itself is a scary concept\u201d. The comment made Tony giggle a little.</p><p>6. The time came when the priest finally said, now you may kiss your mate. Stephen slowly lifted the veil, Tony kept his eyes closed till the veil was lifted off completely, and then only opened his eyes, to see his husband\u2026.. At that very moment his heart skipped a beat and then it ran like a race horse, cheeks got dusted with pink aura as ocean blue-green eyes gazed at him with a soft smile on his husband\u2019s cupid lips, grey streaks of hair proudly stood out at the temples giving him a beautifully sophisticated look. Stephen slowly lowered his mouth, he was quite tall for Tony\u2026 Tony could feel arms wrap around his waist, he himself pressed his hands on his husband\u2019s chest as he softly started to close his eyes awaiting the kiss, he could feel a brush of nose and then warm lips around his own. It was a blissful feeling.</p><p>7. Even at the night of the wedding as they consummated their marriage, and Stephen marked Tony, he didn\u2019t feel any pain\u2026 As Stephen bit down over Steve\u2019s ugly big mark, there was hardly any pain, Tony felt more intoxicating. Along the night came soft kisses, sweet words, soft touches and gentle, very gentle love making.</p><p>8. Stephen was a caring alpha, Tony noticed that.. He wasn\u2019t very good at expressing things with words, so he was more likely to use gestures\u2026 Also Tony tried extra hard this time, but he slowly realized that Stephen didn\u2019t have the same demands as Steve did. He didn\u2019t want Tony to feel dominated either, always taking in consideration of his opinions, bringing back Tony\u2019s favorite flowers when coming home, surprising Tony with movie tickets and all that soft love-making and cuddles\u2026 Also he would receive a kiss before Stephen left for the hospital, and another after he came back.</p><p>9. Tony couldn\u2019t help but feel joy when Stephen asked if he would like to take a job, he was so supportive of it\u2026 And Tony joined defense development research dept, marking droids for the intelligence agencies. Stephen was proud and Tony was just happy that he was being cuddled. Stephen\u2019s expression was hilarious when Tony told him he was pregnant, he stared at him for like a 100years, then suddenly Tony\u2019s happy squeals were heard around the house as Stephen picked him up, spinning them in circles, Tony received at least a 1000 thousand kisses on his face that day.</p><p>10. Stephen should have known better, he should not have brought Karl Mordo in his house, that man was extremely sexist, he berated Tony for dropping the tea cup, and when Stephen didn\u2019t say anything to Tony, he started saying how he couldn\u2019t control his Omega, how a tight slap in his cheek would refrain from further mistakes, Tony dashed out of the room, he was shaking as he slowly  collapsed on the kitchen floor, he could hear Stephen\u2019s angry voice and a heated conservation, he didn\u2019t understand it at all .. His mind was to blank out of fear, he covered his baby bump with his arms,tears were running down his cheeks \u2026. \u201cTony\u201d he heard Stephen\u2019s voice, it sounded angry \u2026\u2018No\u2026 No.. This couldn\u2019t happen again. Not again.. God no please .. Have mercy\u2019\u2026. Tony started crying \u201cNo alpha no ..please no\u201d, crouching into a fetal position on the floor\u2026\u201cplease\u2026 It won\u2019t happen again\u2026 Please mercy alpha.. I\u2019ll lose my baby again\u2026 My baby will die.. please no..\u201d </p><p>11. Stephen stared horrified at his beloved omega, is that what Tony thought of him? Suddenly a bad feeling originated in his gut\u2026 He didn\u2019t waste anymore time, he picked up his crying omega, went straight to the bedroom, where he sat down with Tony across his lap \u2026 soothing him, telling him\u2026 He was safe with him and he would never hurt him or their child, rubbing his hands softly on Tony\u2019s baby bump. Tony finally stopped cried, only small sobs and whimpers came in a few minutes. \u201cShhhh my love, ignore Mordo, he\u2019s a jerk\u2026. Listen to me..I love you and our baby, I wouldn\u2019t hurt you\u201d \u201cS-S-sorry Alpha\u201d \u201csshh, Tony, will you tell me something if I ask you?\u201d Tony nodded face buried in his neck. \u201cWhen your parents mentioned your miscarriage in the previous marriage, it wasn\u2019t really because of any hormonal disproportion or natural cause, was it?\u201d Tony froze for a while\u2026 Then he wailed into Stephen\u2019s neck\u2026 Crying, clutching at him, holding onto him as if Stephen would disappear\u2026\u201c I\u2026I.. Steve\u2026 He\u2026.ahhhhhhhAaaaaa\u201d \u201cShhhh\u2026 It\u2019s ok ok .. You don\u2019t have to say .. You don\u2019t need to use your words\u201d Stephen soothed him as he fell asleep crying.</p><p>12. Tony woke up to soft whispers and a careful rubbing on his bump as the baby kicked\u2026 He opened to his eyes to see Stephen leaned towards his bumps, talking to the baby\u2026\u201c Who\u2019s Daddy\u2019s Little sweetheart? You\u2019re .yes.. You are\u2026 Now now let\u2019s not kick too hard, or else you\u2019ll wake up your papa, he needs rest doesn\u2019t he now sweetheart\u201d Tony felt warmth spread around his chest as he saw all this happen. Stephen seemed to sense his movement, he now moved towards Tony, kissing him on the cheek\u2026 Tony gazed at him.. And his mouth automatically spoke \u201cI love you\u201d.. Stephen smiled widely at that, and kissed his forehead\u2026\u201c Time will tell you my love, how much I love you\u201d</p></p>",

They met in a park once, and against the approval of his parents, Tony married Steve at a young age 24. Little did he know Steve was not the man he thought he was.</p><p>2.Things started getting worse and worse as days passed\u2026 Steve was a stereotypical alpha with too high an ego and too many expectations, Tony tried.. He really did, but complains remained, the food was never good enough, the clothes were never clean enough, he was not being attentive.. And with each disappointment of a day came slaps and harsh sounds of belt hitting skin, and immense amount of verbal abuse. Abuse increased day and night, but Tony didn\u2019t want to go back to his parents\u2026. Because he knew they would say \u201cwhy did you marry him in the first place, when we forbide you?\u201d. Then came the day Tony broke the news of his pregnancy to Steve, that made him happy\u2026 He even was little more considerate with Tony after that, but good things don\u2019t last that long with Tony. Tony was cleaning the dishes, when Steve slammed open the door, drunk and angry\u2026. Tony suffered grievous injuries that day, and he also lost his child at his 5th month of gestation. After these events Steve divorced him claiming he was feeble and suffered from some disease which is why they lost the baby\u2026 And that fact was hidden from him during the wedding or else he would not have married this Omega.</p><p>3.

You are&hellip; Now now let&rsquo;s not kick too hard, or else you&rsquo;ll wake up your papa, he needs rest doesn&rsquo;t he now sweetheart&rdquo; Tony felt warmth spread around his chest as he saw all this happen. Stephen seemed to sense his movement, he now moved towards Tony, kissing him on the cheek&hellip; Tony gazed at him.. And his mouth automatically spoke &ldquo;I love you&rdquo;.. Stephen smiled widely at that, and kissed his forehead&hellip;&ldquo; Time will tell you my love, how much I love you&rdquo;</p></p>",

Tony Stark in all his glory, masquerading as one &lsquo;Sebastian Vincent&rsquo; all for the sake of a diamond ring that he had a very keen eye on. Tony Stark was much more well known around the community as a thief and an excellent one at that. Even though he had been clocked by various armed forces and agencies, Anthony Stark had one thing going for him. The sheer ability to lie out of his ass. &ldquo;Jarvis, how we going buddy?&rdquo; The voice in his ear responded immediately. 'Going great, Sir, everyone seems to be unaware of your presence and as of who you are. The door to the vault is guarded, and there is a fingerprint assess to get into the vault itself. The case may be rigged.&rsquo; Tony nodded to himself and grabbed a flute of champagne, effortlessly blending into the crowd. Tony had an affinity for blending in with people, making easy chatter. He could read people far too easily. He was a spy gone rogue, and that was the only way he had gotten into the thievery business- and thus far not got taken in.</p><p>Unbeknownst to Tony, he had eyes on his back. It was the first time he hadn&rsquo;t spotted someone tailing him, and when he realised he would be rather upset he had missed the handsome man who had been staring at him. He took a sip from the flute of champagne, observing the crowd before setting the glass down, shedding his jacket and straightening his posture, sweeping one of the stainless steel serving plates from the table and passing one of the waiters, who didn&rsquo;t notice anything off or unfamiliar about him. Why would he when there were so many new staff members floating about for the main purpose of the event? Tony smiled to himself as he slipped into the back supply closet, closing the door behind him and clicking the lock. Tony hadn&rsquo;t come with any fancy tools, but he had learned how to improvise from what was seen as the best. His father. He had always thought it odd that Howard taught him all of these abstract methods of survival. Then after he had died he had learnt why at sixteen, when he was recruited into the agency his father had been in. He had lasted there a while before he turned to thievery. It was much more fun.</p><p>Tony had always been a brainbox for a kid. Always trying to impress his father, show him just what he could do even if his father made no plans to actually take care of what he was doing. With finishing MIT at the age of 15, it wasn&rsquo;t a surprise he would end up somewhere either on the good team or the bad team. But then again, Tony had his own side. The 'morally corrupt, but not too much because I steal from the rich guys&rsquo; side. He closed his eyes and took a breather. Now was no time to get all reminiscent. It was work time and time for that diamond ring to be in his possession. Tony liked fancy and extravagant pieces to show off to his company, the devious and the divine lot of them, and from his research, the ring was valued to be the second most expensive diamond in the world. Tony already had the first. A blue diamond to match his favourite car. How fitting.</p><p>Tony got to work, looking around the storage room. Of course, he could try and persuade the host to let him have a look at the ring before the auction started, but that ran far too great of a risk. Of course, for Tony, it would be all fun and games- but he wanted to do it the proper way this time. He needed to get the security guard away from the door where the vault was contained. Easy enough. Interfere with equipment. All he needed was a magnetic field and.. bingo. He grabbed a battery from inside one of the handheld mixers that was being stored in the room, along with one of the cake wire cutters. He loosened up the wire and ripped it from the frame, winding it around the battery and smiling at the familiar buzzing sound. He held it tight in one hand, picking up a tray and venturing out of the kitchen. He neared the door, giving two female guests a charming smile and offering them champagne, having to refrain from chuckling as he heard the quiet exclamation of 'shit&rsquo; from the guard at the door, who had just ripped his earpiece out, turning to storm to his boss, Tony was guessing. He winked at the girls and disappeared behind the door, still unaware of the eyes tracking his every move.</p><p>Tapping the side of his glasses, he gave Jarvis visuals on what he was seeing, glad for the AI he had developed, and the fact that technology was something he was highly gifted at. It made everything that little bit easier. Tony had already lifted a print, and from what Jarvis had gathered that was all he would need to get into the vault. He carried the tray past unsuspecting guards. He should have had to have an ID card to get in at the door, after all. He pushed his way into the room where the vault was located according to floor plans and stepped into a room that looked just like an ordinary lounging room, fitted with a fireplace and all. He knew better. Setting the tray down he looked around the room, eyes landing on the centrepiece of the room. A forgery of van Gogh. Tony had done better paintings than the forgery was himself as a child, and he had never very much been gifted in any of the arts. Anyone could imitate art. No promises of it being good, however.</p><p>He slowly pulled on the painting, rolling his eyes as it opened up on hinges. Typical. He walked through the doorway and up to the scanner and paused. Oh. Not a good sign, it was a full handprint scanner. Of course, he could go back to his original idea- and the easier idea, less risky- of persuading the seller to let him see the ring, but instead he went his own way. Now any good spy- and thief- knows if you scrape plaster from a wall and dust it onto the scanner, cover your hand with material and apply the slightest amount of pressure, you have about a 95% chance of tricking the scanner into thinking you were the last person to use it. As for the 5% chance of it failing- you just had to hope that permissions hadn&rsquo;t been taken away from the last person to use it, or you didn&rsquo;t slip and accidentally register your own fingerprints into a system. Tony let out a sigh of relief as the door clicked open, and there was a small box with silver clasps on it, just daring him to open it. So he did. No alarms went off, and the silence was almost deafening. The beating of his heard made up for the silence, though. The adrenaline rush he got from this was unparalleled. And Tony had jumped from buildings for funsies.</p><p>Picking the small pillow box up that contained the ring, he flipped the lid open to look at the blue diamond, and the alarms started blaring. &ldquo;Balls. Jarv, how many incoming.&rdquo; He tucked the box in his inside pocket, waiting on an answer from the AI as he hopped from the vault, picking up the serving tray and knocking the flutes from it with a crash. 12 gauge stainless steel. Enough to stop the standard issue guns he had seen the guards had on them. A guy with two guns rounded the corner. &ldquo;Listen up buttercup, I know you guys are paid to-&rdquo; He held the serving plate up as he ran across to the large couch, landing behind it and flattening himself. He took in a few gulps of air. &ldquo;protect this, but it really wasn&rsquo;t worth the pain.&rdquo; He sprung up, hurling the serving plate like a frisbee, wincing as it made contact with his neck, Tony watching him fall to the floor. He left the room and broke out into a jog.</p><p>Hopping over the bannister of the stairs he made a run for the front doors, hopping into a car that the valet had just pulled up, unaware to the figure in the back seat. He was smiling to himself as he put his foot down on the accelerator pedal. Knowing people would be quick on his tail, he pulled up at the marina, hopping into the first boat Jarvis could hack into. &ldquo;God bless technology.&rdquo; He twisted as he heard someone else get onto the boat, catching a glimpse of blonde hair before he was knocked unconscious.</p>",

He had always thought it odd that Howard taught him all of these abstract methods of survival. Then after he had died he had learnt why at sixteen, when he was recruited into the agency his father had been in. He had lasted there a while before he turned to thievery. It was much more fun.</p><p>Tony had always been a brainbox for a kid. Always trying to impress his father, show him just what he could do even if his father made no plans to actually take care of what he was doing. With finishing MIT at the age of 15, it wasn\u2019t a surprise he would end up somewhere either on the good team or the bad team. But then again, Tony had his own side. The 'morally corrupt, but not too much because I steal from the rich guys\u2019 side. He closed his eyes and took a breather. Now was no time to get all reminiscent. It was work time and time for that diamond ring to be in his possession. Tony liked fancy and extravagant pieces to show off to his company, the devious and the divine lot of them, and from his research, the ring was valued to be the second most expensive diamond in the world. Tony already had the first. A blue diamond to match his favourite car. How fitting.</p><p>Tony got to work, looking around the storage room. Of course, he could try and persuade the host to let him have a look at the ring before the auction started, but that ran far too great of a risk. Of course, for Tony, it would be all fun and games- but he wanted to do it the proper way this time. He needed to get the security guard away from the door where the vault was contained. Easy enough. Interfere with equipment. All he needed was a magnetic field and.. bingo. He grabbed a battery from inside one of the handheld mixers that was being stored in the room, along with one of the cake wire cutters. He loosened up the wire and ripped it from the frame, winding it around the battery and smiling at the familiar buzzing sound. He held it tight in one hand, picking up a tray and venturing out of the kitchen. He neared the door, giving two female guests a charming smile and offering them champagne, having to refrain from chuckling as he heard the quiet exclamation of 'shit\u2019 from the guard at the door, who had just ripped his earpiece out, turning to storm to his boss, Tony was guessing. He winked at the girls and disappeared behind the door, still unaware of the eyes tracking his every move.</p><p>Tapping the side of his glasses, he gave Jarvis visuals on what he was seeing, glad for the AI he had developed, and the fact that technology was something he was highly gifted at. It made everything that little bit easier. Tony had already lifted a print, and from what Jarvis had gathered that was all he would need to get into the vault. He carried the tray past unsuspecting guards. He should have had to have an ID card to get in at the door, after all. He pushed his way into the room where the vault was located according to floor plans and stepped into a room that looked just like an ordinary lounging room, fitted with a fireplace and all. He knew better. Setting the tray down he looked around the room, eyes landing on the centrepiece of the room. A forgery of van Gogh. Tony had done better paintings than the forgery was himself as a child, and he had never very much been gifted in any of the arts. Anyone could imitate art. No promises of it being good, however.</p><p>He slowly pulled on the painting, rolling his eyes as it opened up on hinges. Typical. He walked through the doorway and up to the scanner and paused. Oh. Not a good sign, it was a full handprint scanner. Of course, he could go back to his original idea- and the easier idea, less risky- of persuading the seller to let him see the ring, but instead he went his own way. Now any good spy- and thief- knows if you scrape plaster from a wall and dust it onto the scanner, cover your hand with material and apply the slightest amount of pressure, you have about a 95% chance of tricking the scanner into thinking you were the last person to use it. As for the 5% chance of it failing- you just had to hope that permissions hadn\u2019t been taken away from the last person to use it, or you didn\u2019t slip and accidentally register your own fingerprints into a system. Tony let out a sigh of relief as the door clicked open, and there was a small box with silver clasps on it, just daring him to open it. So he did. No alarms went off, and the silence was almost deafening. The beating of his heard made up for the silence, though. The adrenaline rush he got from this was unparalleled. And Tony had jumped from buildings for funsies.</p><p>Picking the small pillow box up that contained the ring, he flipped the lid open to look at the blue diamond, and the alarms started blaring. \u201cBalls. Jarv, how many incoming.\u201d He tucked the box in his inside pocket, waiting on an answer from the AI as he hopped from the vault, picking up the serving tray and knocking the flutes from it with a crash. 12 gauge stainless steel.

A guy with two guns rounded the corner. \u201cListen up buttercup, I know you guys are paid to-\u201d He held the serving plate up as he ran across to the large couch, landing behind it and flattening himself.

Tony Stark in all his glory, masquerading as one &lsquo;Sebastian Vincent&rsquo; all for the sake of a diamond ring that he had a very keen eye on. Tony Stark was much more well known around the community as a thief and an excellent one at that. Even though he had been clocked by various armed forces and agencies, Anthony Stark had one thing going for him. The sheer ability to lie out of his ass. &ldquo;Jarvis, how we going buddy?&rdquo; The voice in his ear responded immediately. 'Going great, Sir, everyone seems to be unaware of your presence and as of who you are. The door to the vault is guarded, and there is a fingerprint assess to get into the vault itself. The case may be rigged.&rsquo; Tony nodded to himself and grabbed a flute of champagne, effortlessly blending into the crowd. Tony had an affinity for blending in with people, making easy chatter. He could read people far too easily. He was a spy gone rogue, and that was the only way he had gotten into the thievery business- and thus far not got taken in.</p><p>Unbeknownst to Tony, he had eyes on his back. It was the first time he hadn&rsquo;t spotted someone tailing him, and when he realised he would be rather upset he had missed the handsome man who had been staring at him. He took a sip from the flute of champagne, observing the crowd before setting the glass down, shedding his jacket and straightening his posture, sweeping one of the stainless steel serving plates from the table and passing one of the waiters, who didn&rsquo;t notice anything off or unfamiliar about him. Why would he when there were so many new staff members floating about for the main purpose of the event? Tony smiled to himself as he slipped into the back supply closet, closing the door behind him and clicking the lock. Tony hadn&rsquo;t come with any fancy tools, but he had learned how to improvise from what was seen as the best. His father.
