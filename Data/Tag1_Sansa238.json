Sansa is a Ravenclaw in her fourth year and has decided to help him.\u00a0</small></p><p><small><i>A Harry Potter AU, with Sansa as a wise Ravenclaw (and yes, I&rsquo;m very aware she maybe fits better in Slytherin, but for this one it&rsquo;s Ravenclaw)<br/>Disclaimer: I totally made up this potion for plot purposes ;-)</i></small></p></blockquote><p>\u201cReally, Jon?\u201d Sansa shook her head while she stared at the potion Jon had made. Or better said, she stared at the supposed to be potion Jon had made. \u201cWhich part of a little bit of vervain was so hard to understand? I have no idea what your potion will do exactly, but I can assure you it will not do what it\u2019s supposed to do.\u201d</p><p>Jon bent his head and dipped the tip of his finger in the green brew. He was about to bring the few drops he\u2019d gathered to his lips when Sansa grabbed his wrist and shook her head once again. He was not sure what went wrong. He was never sure what went wrong when making potions, when trying to fly a broomstick, when predicting the future or dealing with magical creatures. He just knew that it did go wrong all the time and then he started wondering if there was even a future for him in magic.</p><p>\u201cNever taste something you don\u2019t know.\u201d She took his kettle and walked to the sink. Carefully she made sure that no left overs could be found again. \u201cStart again.\u201d She placed the empty and clean kettle in front of him and nodded at the ingredients. \u201cYou can do it. You just have to think before you act and read before you do. It\u2019s not that hard.\u201d</p><p>Which was an easy thing to say for Sansa, who was the best in her class and the main gatherer of points for Ravenclaw. For her everything here at Hogwarts was simple and easy. She was made to be a witch, and a great one. Jon however? Jon was not sure if he should have gotten the invitation letter in the first place. </p><p>For most of his life he hadn\u2019t even known that he was a wizard. Yeah, there had been some strange things happening, but for some reason people thought that was just because he was Jon. Strange things happened to Jon. </p><!-- more --><p>It seemed that those strange things were happening because he descended from some long line of ancient and powerful witches. He had his father to thank for that, which made the whole thing even weirder, because he had always thought that Ned Stark, who was very human, was his father and had actually grown up thinking he was the only member of the Stark family who wouldn\u2019t go to Hogwarts. Long story short. The letter came, he discovered that Ned Stark was not really his father and he went to Hogwarts with Robb, a year later followed by Sansa.</p><p>But here he was. And somehow he had made it to his fifth year. But he was kinda sure that he would fail all his tests and would end up doing some shitty job in a shitty office, which was maybe his worst nightmare.</p><p>And somehow Sansa had started to feel sorry for him and had offered to tutor him, something she probably would regret right now. Sansa had probably not known how horrible his wizardy skills truly were.</p><p>But Jon took a deep breath and started again. He read each and every sentence out loud, three times. He wouldn\u2019t really be able to do that during his test by the end of the year, but that was not something to worry about right now. Carefully he grabbed all the ingredients and step by step he followed the instructions, both the typed ones and the ones handwritten by Sansa. </p><p>And all this time she didn\u2019t say anything. She just kept quiet and stared. </p><p>With the tip of his tongue between his lips Jon eventually added the very last ingredient to his potion. Once more he went through all the steps. He was certain he didn\u2019t add too much vervain this time and he was also certain he didn\u2019t stir too short or too long. \u201cI guess this is it\u2026\u201d Jon stared at his potion, the exact same shade of green as his previous one and then he looked at Sansa, who could barely contain the smirk on her face. \u201cI did it right, did I?\u201d Jon started smiling and while Sansa nodded she smiled back at him.</p><p>\u201cThis one should be absolutely perfect!\u201d She stood up and dipped the tips of her fingers in the potion and then she licked the potion carefully off. </p><p>Jon held his breath. If he\u2019d done it wrong, something terrible could happen to Sansa, the only one who really seemed to be kind enough to even try to help him with this mess. If he\u2019d done it right\u2026 He swallowed. \u201cSo\u2026\u201d He scratched the back of his neck. \u201cHow are we gonna test if it worked?\u201d </p><p>The smirk on Sansa\u2019s face brightened. \u201cIt&rsquo;s very simple.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cIf we really want to know if my lips taste like blood now, you\u2019ll have to kiss me.\u201d</p><p>Jon widened his eyes and stared at her. \u201cYou\u2026you want me to kiss you?\u201d</p><p>Sansa crossed her arms over her chest. \u201cIs there something wrong with kissing me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no\u2026\u201d Jon shook his head firmly, but a strange feeling gathered in his stomach and he took a deep breath. \u201cI wanna kiss you, I\u2019d love to, but\u2026\u201d Jon licked his dry lips. \u201cAre you sure you want me to kiss you?\u201d He paused. \u201cI mean, didn\u2019t you say you didn\u2019t wanna kiss anyone and such anymore after what happened with Joffrey and Ramsay.\u201d</p><p>Sansa locked her glance with his, her back straight and her chin lifted. \u201cI didn\u2019t say that exactly. I said that I didn\u2019t want to kiss stupid guys who don\u2019t love me anymore.\u201d She cocked her head. \u201cSo, does that include you, Jon Snow?\u201d She raised her eyebrows and Jon hesitated, not sure if the right words to answer actually existed. \u201cWell? I\u2019m waiting?\u201d She impatiently tapped her foot on the floor.</p><p>\u201cNo\u2026\u201d Jon whispered. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t include me.\u201d He tried to speak louder, mostly because he could barely hear himself. \u201cI don\u2019t really like being confronted like this, but\u2026\u201d Jon shrugged. \u201cYou know that I\u2019ve always liked you and that sometimes I wonder if\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf what?\u201d Sansa swallowed.</p><p>\u201cIf you and I could be more than just\u2026what we are?\u201d Whatever that might be these days. </p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Sansa smiled and she stepped closer towards him. \u201cThen kiss me.\u201d</p><p>Jon stared at her with his eyes wide open and then he carefully pressed the palm of his hand to her cheek. He leaned in and he saw how Sansa closed her eyes. Carefully his lips brushed hers, but Sansa wrapped her arms around his neck and pulled him closer. </p><p>Her lips did taste a little metallic and weird and not at all like he had imagined how she would taste, but he started smiling when he realized that it meant that his potion had worked. Sansa\u2019s lips tasted like blood now.</p><p>And while he smiled, Sansa\u2019s lips parted to invite Jon\u2019s tongue in. </p><p>Minutes later, when their lips were a little red and swollen and the metallic taste of blood had long vanished, Jon and Sansa finally pulled back and stared at each other. </p><p>\u201cSo\u2026\u201d Jon cleared his throat. His lips were tingling and a strange sensation spread through his entire body. \u201cDoes this mean you think we can be more than, well, I don\u2019t know\u2026\u201d</p><p>Sansa smiled and she licked her lips as if she wanted to taste Jon once more. \u201cI think we can be epic, but\u2026\u201d Sansa stared at the potion. \u201cYou need a lot more tutoring, because as a Ravenclaw I have a reputation to uphold. I can\u2019t have it happen that my love fails all his tests.\u201d</p><p>Jon couldn\u2019t be bothered the least by her comments. \u201cA lot more hours of tutoring it is then.&ldquo;</p>",

Sansa is a Ravenclaw in her fourth year and has decided to help him.\u00a0</small></p><p><small><i>A Harry Potter AU, with Sansa as a wise Ravenclaw (and yes, I\u2019m very aware she maybe fits better in Slytherin, but for this one it\u2019s Ravenclaw)<br>Disclaimer: I totally made up this potion for plot purposes ;-)</i></small></p></blockquote><p>\u201cReally, Jon?\u201d Sansa shook her head while she stared at the potion Jon had made. Or better said, she stared at the supposed to be potion Jon had made. \u201cWhich part of a little bit of vervain was so hard to understand? I have no idea what your potion will do exactly, but I can assure you it will not do what it\u2019s supposed to do.\u201d</p><p>Jon bent his head and dipped the tip of his finger in the green brew. He was about to bring the few drops he\u2019d gathered to his lips when Sansa grabbed his wrist and shook her head once again. He was not sure what went wrong. He was never sure what went wrong when making potions, when trying to fly a broomstick, when predicting the future or dealing with magical creatures. He just knew that it did go wrong all the time and then he started wondering if there was even a future for him in magic.</p><p>\u201cNever taste something you don\u2019t know.\u201d She took his kettle and walked to the sink. Carefully she made sure that no left overs could be found again. \u201cStart again.\u201d She placed the empty and clean kettle in front of him and nodded at the ingredients. \u201cYou can do it. You just have to think before you act and read before you do. It\u2019s not that hard.\u201d</p><p>Which was an easy thing to say for Sansa, who was the best in her class and the main gatherer of points for Ravenclaw. For her everything here at Hogwarts was simple and easy. She was made to be a witch, and a great one. Jon however? Jon was not sure if he should have gotten the invitation letter in the first place. </p><p>For most of his life he hadn\u2019t even known that he was a wizard. Yeah, there had been some strange things happening, but for some reason people thought that was just because he was Jon. Strange things happened to Jon. </p>[[MORE]]<p>It seemed that those strange things were happening because he descended from some long line of ancient and powerful witches. He had his father to thank for that, which made the whole thing even weirder, because he had always thought that Ned Stark, who was very human, was his father and had actually grown up thinking he was the only member of the Stark family who wouldn\u2019t go to Hogwarts. Long story short. The letter came, he discovered that Ned Stark was not really his father and he went to Hogwarts with Robb, a year later followed by Sansa.</p><p>But here he was. And somehow he had made it to his fifth year. But he was kinda sure that he would fail all his tests and would end up doing some shitty job in a shitty office, which was maybe his worst nightmare.</p><p>And somehow Sansa had started to feel sorry for him and had offered to tutor him, something she probably would regret right now. Sansa had probably not known how horrible his wizardy skills truly were.</p><p>But Jon took a deep breath and started again. He read each and every sentence out loud, three times. He wouldn\u2019t really be able to do that during his test by the end of the year, but that was not something to worry about right now. Carefully he grabbed all the ingredients and step by step he followed the instructions, both the typed ones and the ones handwritten by Sansa. </p><p>And all this time she didn\u2019t say anything. She just kept quiet and stared. </p><p>With the tip of his tongue between his lips Jon eventually added the very last ingredient to his potion. Once more he went through all the steps. He was certain he didn\u2019t add too much vervain this time and he was also certain he didn\u2019t stir too short or too long. \u201cI guess this is it\u2026\u201d Jon stared at his potion, the exact same shade of green as his previous one and then he looked at Sansa, who could barely contain the smirk on her face. \u201cI did it right, did I?\u201d Jon started smiling and while Sansa nodded she smiled back at him.</p><p>\u201cThis one should be absolutely perfect!\u201d She stood up and dipped the tips of her fingers in the potion and then she licked the potion carefully off. </p><p>Jon held his breath. If he\u2019d done it wrong, something terrible could happen to Sansa, the only one who really seemed to be kind enough to even try to help him with this mess. If he\u2019d done it right\u2026 He swallowed. \u201cSo\u2026\u201d He scratched the back of his neck. \u201cHow are we gonna test if it worked?\u201d </p><p>The smirk on Sansa\u2019s face brightened. \u201cIt\u2019s very simple.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cIf we really want to know if my lips taste like blood now, you\u2019ll have to kiss me.\u201d</p><p>Jon widened his eyes and stared at her. \u201cYou\u2026you want me to kiss you?\u201d</p><p>Sansa crossed her arms over her chest. \u201cIs there something wrong with kissing me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no\u2026\u201d Jon shook his head firmly, but a strange feeling gathered in his stomach and he took a deep breath. \u201cI wanna kiss you, I\u2019d love to, but\u2026\u201d Jon licked his dry lips. \u201cAre you sure you want me to kiss you?\u201d He paused. \u201cI mean, didn\u2019t you say you didn\u2019t wanna kiss anyone and such anymore after what happened with Joffrey and Ramsay.\u201d</p><p>Sansa locked her glance with his, her back straight and her chin lifted. \u201cI didn\u2019t say that exactly. I said that I didn\u2019t want to kiss stupid guys who don\u2019t love me anymore.\u201d She cocked her head. \u201cSo, does that include you, Jon Snow?\u201d She raised her eyebrows and Jon hesitated, not sure if the right words to answer actually existed. \u201cWell? I\u2019m waiting?\u201d She impatiently tapped her foot on the floor.</p><p>\u201cNo\u2026\u201d Jon whispered. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t include me.\u201d He tried to speak louder, mostly because he could barely hear himself. \u201cI don\u2019t really like being confronted like this, but\u2026\u201d Jon shrugged. \u201cYou know that I\u2019ve always liked you and that sometimes I wonder if\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf what?\u201d Sansa swallowed.</p><p>\u201cIf you and I could be more than just\u2026what we are?\u201d Whatever that might be these days. </p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Sansa smiled and she stepped closer towards him. \u201cThen kiss me.\u201d</p><p>Jon stared at her with his eyes wide open and then he carefully pressed the palm of his hand to her cheek. He leaned in and he saw how Sansa closed her eyes. Carefully his lips brushed hers, but Sansa wrapped her arms around his neck and pulled him closer. </p><p>Her lips did taste a little metallic and weird and not at all like he had imagined how she would taste, but he started smiling when he realized that it meant that his potion had worked. Sansa\u2019s lips tasted like blood now.</p><p>And while he smiled, Sansa\u2019s lips parted to invite Jon\u2019s tongue in. </p><p>Minutes later, when their lips were a little red and swollen and the metallic taste of blood had long vanished, Jon and Sansa finally pulled back and stared at each other. </p><p>\u201cSo\u2026\u201d Jon cleared his throat. His lips were tingling and a strange sensation spread through his entire body. \u201cDoes this mean you think we can be more than, well, I don\u2019t know\u2026\u201d</p><p>Sansa smiled and she licked her lips as if she wanted to taste Jon once more. \u201cI think we can be epic, but\u2026\u201d Sansa stared at the potion. \u201cYou need a lot more tutoring, because as a Ravenclaw I have a reputation to uphold. I can\u2019t have it happen that my love fails all his tests.\u201d</p><p>Jon couldn\u2019t be bothered the least by her comments. \u201cA lot more hours of tutoring it is then.\u201c</p></p>",

Why do they need that cover to confirm their ship so desperately? Jonerys doesn&rsquo;t need to prove it&rsquo;s real. We all saw s7 \ud83d\ude02 It&rsquo;s natural they&rsquo;re on that cover and they will be in 1000 more covers. We know Jonerys  is real. We know they fucked but they&rsquo;re NOT ENDGAME. GoT will never go for the obvious endgame and certainly they wouldn&rsquo;t put in bold on a cover before the season starts. You just bit the bait \ud83d\ude0f</h1><p>Some Jonerys stan commented on my previous post and she is comparing the Jonsa hug with their cover. Sweety, we know Jonsa is not real yet, we ship it, squint and analyze. But we know it&rsquo;s not confirmed. If they compare the Jonsa hug with the cover it&rsquo;s because they really feel Jonsa is a possibility, it triggers them. Why do they get so agitated for something that is not real that they think they have to prove their ship to feel better?  That attitude is the one making Jonsa more real for me. Why would they be so triggered by a 3 sec hug of a non confirmed ship?  Another one commented &ldquo;bring s8 trailer&rdquo; so we can see Jon and Dany together&hellip; I mean, we know that, of course they&rsquo;re going to be together in the trailer. Why wouldn&rsquo;t they?</p><p>The Jonsa hug doesn&rsquo;t scream endgame or confirmed ship as the EW cover. That hug actually was made to think Sansa is so mad and that she is going to betray Jon. We Jonsas analyzed the hug and took it  as a part of our ship.
