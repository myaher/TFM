Frowning, Eddie&rsquo;s vision sharpened and focused far beyond what a normal human could have achieved, and then both the coffee and the newspaper hit the pavement.</p><p>&ldquo;Holy shit, that&rsquo;s Iron Man!&rdquo; Eddie said, sprinting towards the bay where Iron Man was fighting what looked like a &ndash; a giant dragon?</p><p><i><b>Who is Iron Man?</b></i> Venom asked, even as he helped Eddie put on speed and vault over cars that barely had a chance to honk before they were gone again. &nbsp;Eddie just let him flip through his memories of Iron Man and Tony Stark; he could tell that Venom was lingering with curiosity over the memories of his one night stand with Tony when he was still working with the Daily Planet out of New York City. &nbsp;At the time, it was kind of Tony&rsquo;s <i>thing</i> to sleep with the reporters who interviewed him, so even though they had made some damned good memories, memories that Eddie had definitely bookmarked in his spank bank, he had known better than to try to make anything more of that night than a good time.</p><p>High in the sky the dragon curled in on itself in a way that seemed impossible and caught Tony in its teeth, shaking him like a dog with a rat before Tony blasted it in the face and it released him with a shriek of rage. &nbsp;Tony tried to get close enough to get it in the face again but as he dodged its teeth a lucky swipe of its claws sent him tumbling out of the sky.</p><p>&ldquo;Venom!&rdquo; &nbsp;But Venom sensed Eddie&rsquo;s urgency before the words could even leave his mouth and Eddie gave up control as he swept over their body with a rush. &nbsp;Tony seemed to be tumbling slowly but also too quickly out of the sky, his repulsors firing irregularly and not enough to stabilize him; Venom extended his talons and then they were climbing up a building, leaping from roof to roof in a bid to catch Tony before he hit the ground. &nbsp;At about the fortieth floor of the Transamerica Pyramid they caught Tony by the wrist with an outflung tentacle, pulling him in close and stopping his fall. &nbsp;&ldquo;<i><b>Gotcha</b></i>,&rdquo; they said with satisfaction.</p><p>They were debating what to do with him now &ndash; put him down on the ground where there was a crowd of people gathering or carry him up to the roof where the dragon was heading their way &ndash; with the face to the suit popped open and Tony was looking at them with raised eyebrows.</p><p>&ldquo;Whoa,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Hi. I&rsquo;m Iron Man, thanks for the uh, helping hand.&rdquo; He tried to move his hand but Venom had him gripped tight.</p><p>&ldquo;<i><b>We are Venom</b></i>,&rdquo; they said, and then with a push from Eddie Venom pulled away from his face. &nbsp;&ldquo;But you might remember me as Eddie.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony&rsquo;s eyes narrow and then widened. &ldquo;Eddie Brock! Daily Planet. We did an interview in what, 2004? You, um, seem a little different than I remember,&rdquo; he said, eyeing the sharp, needle like teeth framing Eddie&rsquo;s face.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Yeah, September 2004. &nbsp;Some stuff has happened since then,&rdquo; Eddie said, shrugging Venom&rsquo;s massive shoulders. \"But it&rsquo;s a bit of a long story.&rdquo; Tony fired up his repulsors and they let him go when it was clear that his suit was back under control, all of the teeth mark dents notwithstanding.</p><p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;d like to hear that story,&rdquo; Tony said. &nbsp;&ldquo;Because I remember the article being great but the sex was <i>fantastic</i>. &nbsp;You know I tried to look you up again but they said you&rsquo;d transferred to San Francisco.

The suit doesn\u2019t make Peter who he is, the suit doesn\u2019t even make Spider-Man who he was. Peter makes Spider-Man who he is, with, or without the suit. And he needs Peter to realize that the suit is just a tool, just a small piece of who Spider-Man is. But it doesn\u2019t define who he is. Tony is trying to show Peter that the suit doesn\u2019t make him who he is. He makes the suit. And if Peter thinks the suit makes him who he is, it\u2019s going to mess him up. He\u2019s trying to show Peter that a suit means nothing if you\u2019re not good and courageous. Tony is trying to make Peter remember that he was still Spider-Man before he had the suit. All the suit does is enhance the abilities he already has. In Iron Man 3, we see Tony declaring that whether or not he has his suit, he\u2019s still Ironman and nothing will change that. </p><p><br/></p><p>And we see another moment like this when Steve Rogers and Tony and arguing. \u201cYeah, big man in a suit of armour.

Tony takes a jab at Steve by telling him \u201ca hero? Like you? You\u2019re a laboratory experiment, Rogers. Everything special about you came out of a bottle.\u201d All of Steve\u2019s abilities came from the super soldier serum, but his abilities aren\u2019t what makes him either. Even before he received the serum Steve knew who he was. He was a fighter despite lacking good health or strength. He had good, set morales and he never faltered when it came to doing the right thing. All the Avengers know who they are and they know that they\u2019re suits and abilities aren\u2019t what make them heroes. Which is exactly what Tony is trying to show/teach Peter. </p><p><br/></p><p>People may have seen Tony taking Peter\u2019s suit away as unnecessary and cruel, but Tony did the right thing.
