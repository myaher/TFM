You\u2019re a fucking disrespectful man who doesn\u2019t know how to\ntreat women right!\u201d you argued back, the memories of him flirting with the waitress\nduring your date earlier flashing past your eyes. You and Andr\u00e9 had been\ntogether for four months but you didn\u2019t even know what had convinced you to get\ntogether with him because you had been miserable even since.</p><p>It had been six months since Chris had left you for Vanessa, the girl who\nhad broken his heart the night before their prom. The pain and disappointment you\nfelt was the worst thing you had ever felt in your life. You loved Chris with\nyour whole heart and it was a harsh blow to have him dump you like a bag of trash\nfor someone who just wanted him for fame.</p><p>You hadn\u2019t really let yourself hurt and cry over the failed relationship:\nYou distracted yourself with work and new hobbies and didn\u2019t allow yourself to\ncry the disgusting pain in your heart out. What Chris had done had changed the\nway you thought and felt about love. Suddenly, seeing happy couples disgusted you\nand you distanced yourself from your friends who were in serious relationships,\nnot being able to look them in the face while knowing that they had somebody\nwho <i>truly</i> loved them.</p><p>Despite that you weren\u2019t the biggest fan of love, you through yourself out\nin the dating world in order to try to get Chris out of your mind. A few weeks\nlater, you randomly met Andr\u00e9 at the grocery store and felt attracted to him because\nhe was the total opposite of Chris: He barely showed his interest in you when\nyou began to date, didn\u2019t make any effort in surprising you with romantic and sweet\ngestures to show his appreciation for you and certainly didn\u2019t flaunt you as\nhis girlfriend to the whole world.</p><p>Your inner goddess was had been locked in a cave and had to watch you let\nyourself get disrespected by Andr\u00e9. The four months you had spent with him only\nmade you realize that no other man was able to make you feel as special as\nChris had. But every time he crossed your mind, you shook your head and\ncontinued to let your boyfriend disrespect you.</p><p>Your prediction about Vanessa had come true a few weeks ago. An audio\nrecord about her bragging about the attention and business deals she had\nreceived since having become Chris\u2019s girlfriend got leaked by one of her enemies.\nYou had thought that that would be the ultimate thing you\u2019d need in order to\nmove on from Chris, but were disappointed when you ended up crying your eyes\nout on the bathroom floor as you realized that you felt bad for him and still\nloved him very much.</p><p>Vanessa quickly got dragged through the mud, lost her business deals and desperately\ntried to clear her image with a dishonest apology posted on her Instagram account.\nShe had gotten what she deserved but that didn\u2019t matter to you anymore, you\nwere a complete mess and had lost touch with head, heart and soul.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou know what?!\u201d you cut Andr\u00e9 off as he was in the middle of cussing you out,\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d he hissed while continuing to glare at you. You let out a few deep breaths\nwhile feeling the bottled-up emotions from the past six months course through\nyour body, resulting in thick tears cascading down your cheeks and blurring\nyour vision.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so fucking done with you\u201d you whispered and sniffled loudly, storming\nyour way to the front door of Andre\u2019s house while he yelled \u201cYou\u2019re not! You\u2019re\ngonna beg for a second chance in a few days!\u201d making you roll your eyes while\nyou opened the door and rushed down the front porch onto the street, ignoring\nthe weird glances you received from people walking by.</p><p>\u201cFucking idiot. Stupid me\u201d you cried to yourself while walking down the\nstreet, desperate to find some private place you could quickly shed a few tears\nbefore having to order an Uber to get to your apartment.</p><p>Your heart was aching heavily in your chest while you walked past a random\ncaf\u00e9, catching a glimpse of yourself in the reflection of the window and\nholding your breath for a second. You looked horrible, the pain you had been trying\nto hide for months was now clouding your eyes while the exhausting of your toxic\nrelationship was scattered all over your face and posture.</p><p>\u201cWow\u201d was all you were able to croak out, not wanting to believe how you\nhad drastically changed for the worst. You blinked a few times while clearing\nyour throat, not knowing what to think of while continued to stare at your\nreflection.</p><p>Suddenly, some movements behind the window made you focus on what was going on inside the caf\u00e9 and made you gasp loudly upon seeing Chris sitting not too far\naway from the window and staring directly at you. Your heart sank to the pit of\nyour stomach while you quickly turned away and jogged your way down the street\nwhile getting your phone out of your pocket.</p><p>Your hands were shaking while you tried to order an Uber, not paying\nattention when running across the street while a car was approaching\nyou at a dangerously quick pace. </p><p>\u201cWatch out!\u201d somebody yelled behind you before pulling you back by the arm,\ntheir harsh grip making you drop your phone and watch it get run over by the car\nthat had almost hit you, the glass shattered all over the ground while the harsh\npounding of your heart echoed in your ears.</p><p>Loud pants left your lips as reality slowly hit you: you had almost lost\nyour life.</p><p>Soft sobs left your lips while the tears blurred your vision again, the\nstranger behind you slowly turning you around and engulfing you in a tight hug,\na hug that felt very familiar and soothing.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay\u201d Chris whispered while placing a tender kiss on top of your\nhead, his heart pounding in his chest as the traumatic images of you almost\ngetting hit by a car flashing past his eyes. His hands were trembling while\nyour body shook from all the crying. </p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get you somewhere safe\u201d your ex-boyfriend then muttered while gently\nleading you to his car that was parked not too far away down the street. He\nignored the weird stares the two of you received, your health being his only concern\nat the moment.</p><p>Once you had reached his car, Chris helped you get into the passenger\u2019s\nseat and made sure that your seat belt was fastened before quickly getting into\nthe driver\u2019s seat and starting the engine, shaky breaths leaving his lips as he\nstill was trying to process what had happened.</p><p>All you could do was stare down at your intertwined fingers while\ncontinuing to sob to yourself, silently wondering how long you\u2019d continue to\nfeel so broken and defeated while Chris drove the two of you to your once\nshared house. </p><p>\u00a0</p><p><b><br/></b></p><figure data-orig-width=\"3300\" data-orig-height=\"471\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img

You\u2019re a fucking disrespectful man who doesn\u2019t know how to\ntreat women right!\u201d you argued back, the memories of him flirting with the waitress\nduring your date earlier flashing past your eyes. You and Andr\u00e9 had been\ntogether for four months but you didn\u2019t even know what had convinced you to get\ntogether with him because you had been miserable even since.</p><p>It had been six months since Chris had left you for Vanessa, the girl who\nhad broken his heart the night before their prom. The pain and disappointment you\nfelt was the worst thing you had ever felt in your life. You loved Chris with\nyour whole heart and it was a harsh blow to have him dump you like a bag of trash\nfor someone who just wanted him for fame.</p><p>You hadn\u2019t really let yourself hurt and cry over the failed relationship:\nYou distracted yourself with work and new hobbies and didn\u2019t allow yourself to\ncry the disgusting pain in your heart out. What Chris had done had changed the\nway you thought and felt about love. Suddenly, seeing happy couples disgusted you\nand you distanced yourself from your friends who were in serious relationships,\nnot being able to look them in the face while knowing that they had somebody\nwho <i>truly</i> loved them.</p><p>Despite that you weren\u2019t the biggest fan of love, you through yourself out\nin the dating world in order to try to get Chris out of your mind. A few weeks\nlater, you randomly met Andr\u00e9 at the grocery store and felt attracted to him because\nhe was the total opposite of Chris: He barely showed his interest in you when\nyou began to date, didn\u2019t make any effort in surprising you with romantic and sweet\ngestures to show his appreciation for you and certainly didn\u2019t flaunt you as\nhis girlfriend to the whole world.</p><p>Your inner goddess was had been locked in a cave and had to watch you let\nyourself get disrespected by Andr\u00e9. The four months you had spent with him only\nmade you realize that no other man was able to make you feel as special as\nChris had. But every time he crossed your mind, you shook your head and\ncontinued to let your boyfriend disrespect you.</p><p>Your prediction about Vanessa had come true a few weeks ago. An audio\nrecord about her bragging about the attention and business deals she had\nreceived since having become Chris\u2019s girlfriend got leaked by one of her enemies.\nYou had thought that that would be the ultimate thing you\u2019d need in order to\nmove on from Chris, but were disappointed when you ended up crying your eyes\nout on the bathroom floor as you realized that you felt bad for him and still\nloved him very much.</p><p>Vanessa quickly got dragged through the mud, lost her business deals and desperately\ntried to clear her image with a dishonest apology posted on her Instagram account.\nShe had gotten what she deserved but that didn\u2019t matter to you anymore, you\nwere a complete mess and had lost touch with head, heart and soul.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou know what?!\u201d you cut Andr\u00e9 off as he was in the middle of cussing you out,\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d he hissed while continuing to glare at you.

You&rsquo;re a fucking disrespectful man who doesn&rsquo;t know how to\ntreat women right!&rdquo; you argued back, the memories of him flirting with the waitress\nduring your date earlier flashing past your eyes. You and Andr&eacute; had been\ntogether for four months but you didn&rsquo;t even know what had convinced you to get\ntogether with him because you had been miserable even since.</p><p>It had been six months since Chris had left you for Vanessa, the girl who\nhad broken his heart the night before their prom. The pain and disappointment you\nfelt was the worst thing you had ever felt in your life. You loved Chris with\nyour whole heart and it was a harsh blow to have him dump you like a bag of trash\nfor someone who just wanted him for fame.</p><p>You hadn&rsquo;t really let yourself hurt and cry over the failed relationship:\nYou distracted yourself with work and new hobbies and didn&rsquo;t allow yourself to\ncry the disgusting pain in your heart out. What Chris had done had changed the\nway you thought and felt about love. Suddenly, seeing happy couples disgusted you\nand you distanced yourself from your friends who were in serious relationships,\nnot being able to look them in the face while knowing that they had somebody\nwho <i>truly</i> loved them.</p><p>Despite that you weren&rsquo;t the biggest fan of love, you through yourself out\nin the dating world in order to try to get Chris out of your mind. A few weeks\nlater, you randomly met Andr&eacute; at the grocery store and felt attracted to him because\nhe was the total opposite of Chris: He barely showed his interest in you when\nyou began to date, didn&rsquo;t make any effort in surprising you with romantic and sweet\ngestures to show his appreciation for you and certainly didn&rsquo;t flaunt you as\nhis girlfriend to the whole world.</p><p>Your inner goddess was had been locked in a cave and had to watch you let\nyourself get disrespected by Andr&eacute;. The four months you had spent with him only\nmade you realize that no other man was able to make you feel as special as\nChris had. But every time he crossed your mind, you shook your head and\ncontinued to let your boyfriend disrespect you.</p><p>Your prediction about Vanessa had come true a few weeks ago. An audio\nrecord about her bragging about the attention and business deals she had\nreceived since having become Chris&rsquo;s girlfriend got leaked by one of her enemies.\nYou had thought that that would be the ultimate thing you&rsquo;d need in order to\nmove on from Chris, but were disappointed when you ended up crying your eyes\nout on the bathroom floor as you realized that you felt bad for him and still\nloved him very much.</p><p>Vanessa quickly got dragged through the mud, lost her business deals and desperately\ntried to clear her image with a dishonest apology posted on her Instagram account.\nShe had gotten what she deserved but that didn&rsquo;t matter to you anymore, you\nwere a complete mess and had lost touch with head, heart and soul.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;You know what?!&rdquo; you cut Andr&eacute; off as he was in the middle of cussing you out,\n&ldquo;What?!&rdquo; he hissed while continuing to glare at you. You let out a few deep breaths\nwhile feeling the bottled-up emotions from the past six months course through\nyour body, resulting in thick tears cascading down your cheeks and blurring\nyour vision.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so fucking done with you&rdquo; you whispered and sniffled loudly, storming\nyour way to the front door of Andre&rsquo;s house while he yelled &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not! You&rsquo;re\ngonna beg for a second chance in a few days!&rdquo; making you roll your eyes while\nyou opened the door and rushed down the front porch onto the street, ignoring\nthe weird glances you received from people walking by.</p><p>&ldquo;Fucking idiot. Stupid me&rdquo; you cried to yourself while walking down the\nstreet, desperate to find some private place you could quickly shed a few tears\nbefore having to order an Uber to get to your apartment.</p><p>Your heart was aching heavily in your chest while you walked past a random\ncaf&eacute;, catching a glimpse of yourself in the reflection of the window and\nholding your breath for a second. You looked horrible, the pain you had been trying\nto hide for months was now clouding your eyes while the exhausting of your toxic\nrelationship was scattered all over your face and posture.</p><p>&ldquo;Wow&rdquo; was all you were able to croak out, not wanting to believe how you\nhad drastically changed for the worst. You blinked a few times while clearing\nyour throat, not knowing what to think of while continued to stare at your\nreflection.</p><p>Suddenly, some movements behind the window made you focus on what was going on inside the caf&eacute; and made you gasp loudly upon seeing Chris sitting not too far\naway from the window and staring directly at you. Your heart sank to the pit of\nyour stomach while you quickly turned away and jogged your way down the street\nwhile getting your phone out of your pocket.</p><p>Your hands were shaking while you tried to order an Uber, not paying\nattention when running across the street while a car was approaching\nyou at a dangerously quick pace. </p><p>&ldquo;Watch out!&rdquo; somebody yelled behind you before pulling you back by the arm,\ntheir harsh grip making you drop your phone and watch it get run over by the car\nthat had almost hit you, the glass shattered all over the ground while the harsh\npounding of your heart echoed in your ears.</p><p>Loud pants left your lips as reality slowly hit you: you had almost lost\nyour life.</p><p>Soft sobs left your lips while the tears blurred your vision again, the\nstranger behind you slowly turning you around and engulfing you in a tight hug,\na hug that felt very familiar and soothing.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay&rdquo; Chris whispered while placing a tender kiss on top of your\nhead, his heart pounding in his chest as the traumatic images of you almost\ngetting hit by a car flashing past his eyes. His hands were trembling while\nyour body shook from all the crying. </p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get you somewhere safe&rdquo; your ex-boyfriend then muttered while gently\nleading you to his car that was parked not too far away down the street. He\nignored the weird stares the two of you received, your health being his only concern\nat the moment.</p><p>Once you had reached his car, Chris helped you get into the passenger&rsquo;s\nseat and made sure that your seat belt was fastened before quickly getting into\nthe driver&rsquo;s seat and starting the engine, shaky breaths leaving his lips as he\nstill was trying to process what had happened.</p><p>All you could do was stare down at your intertwined fingers while\ncontinuing to sob to yourself, silently wondering how long you&rsquo;d continue to\nfeel so broken and defeated while Chris drove the two of you to your once\nshared house. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b><br /></b></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img

The question caught him off guard as no one had ever asked him\nthat, but after he composed himself, he cleared his throat and smiled</p><p>-&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ve learned a\nlot about the black culture.

You almost lost it when he actually started doing shout out to the product\nbrands you were using, making your social media notifications shoot through the\nroof as his fans were now asking where you were purchasing the hair products\nfor a decent price</p><p>-After the interview,\nChris arrived at your shared apartment and laughed when he found you in the bathroom,\ntaking pictures of all your hair products and sending them to his fans through\ndirect message on Instagram and Twitter</p><p>-&ldquo;Oh no, what have I done?&rdquo;\nChris chuckled as he joined you on the bathroom floor and helped you taking the\npictures.

You had fallen asleep so you had missed breakfast, thankfully Lily brought you something to eat.<br/>You just wanted to stay in bed but today you had an important meeting. Everyone stand up when Captain Rogers enters the room. As soon as you see him, the memory of the blonde woman in his bed comes to you. God, you have to forget about him. <br/>&ldquo;Today we have a new mission, these men&rdquo; Several photos of men appear on the screen &ldquo;they are planning an attack in New York, our mission is to infiltrate and discover where they intend to attack, these men will be in different buildings so we will form pairs and we&rsquo;ll infiltrate, we don&rsquo;t want to attract\u00a0 attention, if you see that you are going to be discovered you abort the mission&rdquo; he takes a moment before continuing &ldquo;Frank, Josh, Mark and Joey this man will be your target, in this file you have all the information you will need, Lily, you will go with Sam, he will inform you of everything&rdquo;<br/>&ldquo;who&rsquo;s Sam?&rdquo; Lily asks.<br/>&ldquo;Sam Wilson, he will help us in this mission&rdquo; Steve explains.<br/>&ldquo;OMG i&rsquo;m going to a mission with Falcon&rdquo; Lily says excitedly.<br/>&ldquo;And Y/N you&rsquo;ll go with me&rdquo; He gives you a file &ldquo;here you have all the information&rdquo; Great, how are you supposed to forget about him if you have to spend the night with him? &ldquo;he will be at a party at his house, I left a dress in your room &hellip; Natasha has chosen it, I think it will be your size&rdquo;<br/>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to read the report&rdquo; Great now you have to wear the dress that the girlfriend has chosen for you.<br/>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll pick you up in 20 minutes, we&rsquo;ll talk about the details on the way to the party&rdquo; he says before going to talk to other soldiers.\u00a0</p><!-- more --><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe I&rsquo;m going on a mission with Sam Wilson!!!&rdquo; Lily screams when she enters the room.</p><p>&ldquo;I did not know you were a fan&rdquo; you say.</p><p>&ldquo;he&rsquo;s hot&rdquo; She stops when she sees you &ldquo;you look amazing!&rdquo; <br/>&ldquo;thanks&rdquo; Captain America&rsquo;s girlfriend has good taste, It is a bit tight and short of what you are used to but it is beautiful.<br/>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have Steve Rogers distracted all night&rdquo; You were going to say something when someone knocked on your door.<br/>&ldquo;Y/N are you&hellip; ready?&rdquo; Steve seems surprised when you open the door.<br/>&ldquo;yes, i&rsquo;m ready for the mission&rdquo; you say grabbing your bag<br/>&ldquo;good&rdquo; \u00a0he says and you would have sworn to have seen him blush. <br/>&ldquo;be careful&rdquo; You hug Lily before leaving <br/>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, she&rsquo;ll be fine, she&rsquo;ll be with Sam&rdquo; Steve smiles at you as he opens the car door for you. The party must be close if he was driving.<br/>&ldquo;so&hellip; what&rsquo;s the plan?&rdquo; you asks.<br/>&ldquo;we are a couple&rdquo; You almost choke when you hear him say that but he continues explaining the plan &ldquo;here I have the invitations for the party at his house, in his office he has to have the plans of where he wants to attack, once we know where, we leave&rdquo; <br/>&ldquo;sounds good&rdquo; you say looking out the window, it seems that his mission is to torture you, you try to forget him but you can&rsquo;t do it if you have to act like his girlfriend. </p><p>40 minutes later you arrive at the party.<br/>&ldquo;Are you sure they won\u2019t recognize you?&rdquo; you say getting out of the car, Steve had dyed his hair dark, people usually know him blind and without a beard but he had been letting his beard grow for weeks, maybe for this mission.<br/>&ldquo;I guess we&rsquo;re going to find out&rdquo; Steve puts his arm so you can grab him. Steve was right, they didn\u2019t recognize him. <br/>&ldquo;this house is huge where do we start?&rdquo; you say it in a low voice.<br/>&ldquo;we have to dance first&quot;\u00a0He says surprising you.<br/>&quot;what?&quot;\u00a0<br/>&quot;we have to act normally, we can&rsquo;t arrive and start looking, we have to be seen together&rdquo; he explains.</p><p><br/></p><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"313\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/ad45cbcddbcbea05f80dbbd535a33cd7/tumblr_inline_pmtyq4Etok1s3c2y7_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"313\"/></figure><p><br/></p><p>The room was full of couples dancing, Steve places his hand on your waist and you put yours around his neck.<br/>&ldquo;I had never danced like that&rdquo; you admit.<br/>&ldquo;Just follow my steps, it&rsquo;s easy&rdquo; he says smiling seeing you nervous &ldquo;you look beautiful Y/N&rdquo; he says.<br/>&ldquo;Your girlfriend has good taste&rdquo; You say jealous.<br/>&ldquo;my girlfriend?&rdquo; He says confused.<br/>&ldquo;Natasha&rdquo; you say still dancing.<br/>&ldquo;she&rsquo;s not my girlfriend, she&rsquo;s the black widow&rdquo; he says with a big smile.<br/>&ldquo;she&rsquo;s not? wait&hellip; you mean <i>the</i><b> </b>black widow?&rdquo; God, you are stupid.<br/>&ldquo;Did you think she was my girlfriend?\u00a0 Banner would kill me&rdquo; Having this conversation while you were dancing with him was not a good idea. You were sure you were flushed &ldquo;but your right, she has good taste, that dress suits you very well&rdquo;<br/>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a little short for my liking&rdquo; you see how Steve bites his lip when you talk about how short the dress is.<br/>&ldquo;you&rsquo;re perfect&hellip;the dress, the dress is perfect&rdquo; he explains quickly &ldquo;They have already seen us dance, we have to &hellip; find his office&rdquo; he says taking a step back.<br/>&ldquo;Of course, the mission&hellip;&rdquo; For a moment you had forgotten the real reason why you were dancing with him.</p><p>You and Steve go upstairs where the rooms were. You enter several rooms but you can\u2019t find anything, at least until you enter the last room, his office.<br/>&ldquo;we have to hurry&rdquo; he says searching in his desk.<br/>&ldquo;Wait, there is something here&rdquo; you say and Steve approaches you &ldquo;information about the hours with the most passengers in Grand Central Station, there are pictures of the whole station&hellip;.the security cameras and the guards are marked with an x&rdquo; <br/>&ldquo;We already know where they are going to attack, but when?&rdquo; Steve asks next to you. <br/>&ldquo;i don&rsquo;t know&hellip;&rdquo; You were looking for more information when you hear the door open. You don\u2019t give Steve a chance to say anything when you kiss him. He only takes a second to surround you with his arms and correspond the kiss. <br/>&ldquo;what are you doing here? You can&rsquo;t be here&rdquo; says the man you&rsquo;re investigating.<br/>&ldquo;oh my god&hellip;&rdquo; You say embarrassed walking away from Steve &ldquo;We just wanted to be alone, you know&rdquo; You say acting.<br/>&ldquo;get out&rdquo; he says angry. <br/>&ldquo;Sorry about this, we&rsquo;re leaving&rdquo; Steve speaks for the first time.
