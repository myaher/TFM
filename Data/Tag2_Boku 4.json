Sadly, it&rsquo;s not enough for you. You need something larger.</p><p>&ldquo;M-Momo,&rdquo; you whine. &ldquo;Please, I need more.&rdquo;</p><p>Momo chuckles, slipping her fingers out slowly with a kiss to your forehead. She reaches over on the bedside table for one of her smaller vibrators she&rsquo;d had beforehand. She brings it closer and you moan in anticipation.</p><p>Momo teases the vibrator around your entrance, just bare pushing the tip in. You whimper, tired of having to wait. Momo sees this, deciding to finally insert the vibrator inside you. Unfortunately, Momo&rsquo;s finger had already stretched you out enough, so it didn&rsquo;t feel as pleasurable. Momo giggles at your frustrations. She only felt like teasing you, which is why is left the vibrator off and chose her smallest one.</p><p>&ldquo;Is this enough, baby?&rdquo; She whispered in your ear. You only groan, reaching a hand up to pull at her long, silky hair. She takes that as a &lsquo;no.&rsquo; Still, she wouldn&rsquo;t turn the vibrate on.</p><p>Carefully, she switches the hand that was moving the vibrator instead you to her non-dominant hand. Now, with her free hand, she takes a large-sized dildo and a bottle of lube from her bedside drawer and places it next to her. Finally, Momo decides to turn on the vibrator in order for her to free up her hands, but only sets it to the a medium. She inserts the vibrator all the way inside you in an effort to make you feel better for the time being.</p><p>You whine, bucking your hips. You want more, yet\u2026 If this is what Momo is giving you, then you have to take it. &ldquo;Momo\u2026&rdquo;</p><p>Momo quickly lathers the large dildo with lube, not missing a single spot. She didn&rsquo;t want to make her babygirl wait for long, after all. &ldquo;I know, baby, I know.&rdquo; She says. She brings the bottle of lube closer to you. &ldquo;Did you prepare yourself before like I asked you to?&rdquo;</p><p>You shudder, suddenly excited for what was to come. &ldquo;Y-Yes, I did.&rdquo;</p><p>Momo grins, bringing a lubed up finger to your clit and gently pressing down. You moan, throwing your head back. Momo circles around your clit, not giving you exactly what you wanted. As soon as you let out a whimper, she trails her finger down to your open. She inserts her finger into your pussy, swirling it around slowly. You&rsquo;re about to go crazy.</p><p>&ldquo;Momo, please!&rdquo; You beg, the teasing becoming too much for you.</p><p>Momo licks her lips at this, loving nothing more than hearing you cry out for her. She takes her finger out, trailing in even further down to your second entrance, and slips it inside.</p><p>You yelp, not expecting for her to use your ass, as well. Either way, you&rsquo;re not complaining. After all, she did say for you to prepare yourself. As Momo slips another finger inside your tight asshole, she takes her other hand and turns up the setting in your vibrator. She presses her thumb against your clit, lightly rubbing against in.</p><p>&ldquo;You want more?&rdquo; She asks.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; You shriek, unable to take such small movements. &ldquo;Please!&rdquo;</p><p>Grinning, Momo removes her fingers, along with the vibrator. She turns off the vibrator and sets it to the side. You&rsquo;re squirming from the emptiness you feel and just want her to get in with it.</p><p>As if hearing your thoughts, Momo takes hold of the large dildo she&rsquo;d lubed up and places it over the opening of your pussy. &ldquo;Do you want it here?&rdquo;</p><p>You whine in frustration, bucking your hips. &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Too bad,&rdquo; she smiles sadistically. Instead, she brings the dildo further down, pressing it against your asshole. Slowly, she pushes the tip inside.</p><p>You groan, relaxing your ass so it&rsquo;s able to go inside more smoothly. &ldquo;Momo\u2026&rdquo;</p><p>She forces the dildo further inside you, wanting to see you take it all. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it, baby.&rdquo; She coos.</p><p>You whimper at the praise, feeling the dildo stretch the ring of your asshole the furthest it&rsquo;s been stretched before. You wince at the slight pain, however it ends quickly as the dildo is as deep inside as it can go, Momo only being able to see the widened end of it.</p><p>Unhurriedly, she starts to pull the dildo back, then suddenly, pushes it back in. You moan, wanting her to go faster. She pumps the dildo inside you at a steady pace.</p><p>With her other hand, Momo circles your sensitive clit once more. It feels so good, but your pussy feels so empty.</p><p>&ldquo;I\u2026 I n-need\u2026&rdquo; You mumble. &ldquo;Momo, please, I need-!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sssh.&rdquo; She interrupted you. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re getting there.&rdquo; You start to see a faint glow coming from her arm.</p><p><i>It must be her quirk,</i>\u00a0you think. You sigh, knowing that you&rsquo;re in good hands and Momo&rsquo;s going to take care of you. Leaning back, you let yourself be carried by the pleasure of something so large moving inside your ass, pressing against all the right places, and the pressure of her fingers gently stroking your sensitivity.</p><p>Suddenly, you feel her hand move away from your clit. About to protest, you stop short upon seeing the\u00a0<i>massive dildo</i>\u00a0she had in her hand. It had to be at least XL or XXL.</p><p>You feel yourself growing wetter at the thought of that going inside you and you moan. &ldquo;Please\u2026&rdquo; You don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re asking for, but apparently Momo does. She smiles gently at you, holding the base of the dildo and bringing it to your free entrance.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you ready?&rdquo; She asks as if you haven&rsquo;t been ready the entire time. You only nod.</p><p>Steadily, Momo pushes the dildo inside your neglected cunt. You cry out, the stretch feeling oh-so-good. &ldquo;Momo!&rdquo;</p><p>Momo wastes no time in shoving it in the rest of the way and it slides in easily because if how wet you became. You scream, unable to hold it back. With this gigantic dildo inside your pussy paired with the large one in your ass, you felt stuffed.</p><p>You felt the dildo inside your ass started to pick up speed, as well and Momo starting to pump the larger one deep in your pussy. Since both her hands were busy, she brought her head down to lap at your clit, doing figure eights.</p><p>It was too much, you were so full. You moaned unintelligibly, thrusting up against her mouth. The dildos were moving so fast, so deep inside you. You didn&rsquo;t even know you could be stretched this far, but it felt incredible. You didn&rsquo;t want it to stop.</p><p>Momo suckles on your clit, pumping the dildos even faster. You feel tears streaming down your face, the knot in your stomach becoming to much to handle.</p><p>&ldquo;Momo!&rdquo; You choke, your body starting to shake. &ldquo;I-I can&rsquo;t! I&rsquo;m gonna-!&rdquo;</p><p>You come undone, everything around you blurring into the background. You feel white, hot pleasure all over you. You pussy and ass clench on the dildos as Momo pushes them in quickly as far as they&rsquo;ll go. You feel them so deep inside you, nothing left untouched. Suddenly, you feel something start to come out of one of your holes, however you&rsquo;re too far in orgasmic bliss to know which one.</p><p>You squirt hard, Momo just watching in amazement and adoration. You finally start to come down from your high, your body shivering in the aftershocks of your orgasm. Your eyes focus once more and you look at Momo, questioning.</p><p>&ldquo;D-Did I-&rdquo; you stutter. &ldquo;Did I just\u2026 squirt?&rdquo;</p><p>Momo chuckles, pulling both dildos out of you at the same time. You moan, feeling your juices spill out and onto the bedsheets.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, you did.&rdquo; She says, &ldquo;I should make you do it again.&rdquo;</p><p><b>&mdash;-</b></p><p>enjoy another ao3 request lol <i>- shongu</i></p>",

Sadly, it\u2019s not enough for you. You need something larger.</p><p>\u201cM-Momo,\u201d you whine. \u201cPlease, I need more.\u201d</p><p>Momo chuckles, slipping her fingers out slowly with a kiss to your forehead. She reaches over on the bedside table for one of her smaller vibrators she\u2019d had beforehand. She brings it closer and you moan in anticipation.</p><p>Momo teases the vibrator around your entrance, just bare pushing the tip in. You whimper, tired of having to wait. Momo sees this, deciding to finally insert the vibrator inside you. Unfortunately, Momo\u2019s finger had already stretched you out enough, so it didn\u2019t feel as pleasurable. Momo giggles at your frustrations. She only felt like teasing you, which is why is left the vibrator off and chose her smallest one.</p><p>\u201cIs this enough, baby?\u201d She whispered in your ear. You only groan, reaching a hand up to pull at her long, silky hair. She takes that as a \u2018no.\u2019 Still, she wouldn\u2019t turn the vibrate on.</p><p>Carefully, she switches the hand that was moving the vibrator instead you to her non-dominant hand. Now, with her free hand, she takes a large-sized dildo and a bottle of lube from her bedside drawer and places it next to her. Finally, Momo decides to turn on the vibrator in order for her to free up her hands, but only sets it to the a medium. She inserts the vibrator all the way inside you in an effort to make you feel better for the time being.</p><p>You whine, bucking your hips. You want more, yet\u2026 If this is what Momo is giving you, then you have to take it. \u201cMomo\u2026\u201d</p><p>Momo quickly lathers the large dildo with lube, not missing a single spot. She didn\u2019t want to make her babygirl wait for long, after all. \u201cI know, baby, I know.\u201d She says. She brings the bottle of lube closer to you. \u201cDid you prepare yourself before like I asked you to?\u201d</p><p>You shudder, suddenly excited for what was to come. \u201cY-Yes, I did.\u201d</p><p>Momo grins, bringing a lubed up finger to your clit and gently pressing down. You moan, throwing your head back. Momo circles around your clit, not giving you exactly what you wanted. As soon as you let out a whimper, she trails her finger down to your open. She inserts her finger into your pussy, swirling it around slowly. You\u2019re about to go crazy.</p><p>\u201cMomo, please!\u201d You beg, the teasing becoming too much for you.</p><p>Momo licks her lips at this, loving nothing more than hearing you cry out for her. She takes her finger out, trailing in even further down to your second entrance, and slips it inside.</p><p>You yelp, not expecting for her to use your ass, as well. Either way, you\u2019re not complaining. After all, she did say for you to prepare yourself. As Momo slips another finger inside your tight asshole, she takes her other hand and turns up the setting in your vibrator. She presses her thumb against your clit, lightly rubbing against in.</p><p>\u201cYou want more?\u201d She asks.</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d You shriek, unable to take such small movements. \u201cPlease!\u201d</p><p>Grinning, Momo removes her fingers, along with the vibrator. She turns off the vibrator and sets it to the side. You\u2019re squirming from the emptiness you feel and just want her to get in with it.</p><p>As if hearing your thoughts, Momo takes hold of the large dildo she\u2019d lubed up and places it over the opening of your pussy. \u201cDo you want it here?\u201d</p><p>You whine in frustration, bucking your hips. \u201cYes!\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo bad,\u201d she smiles sadistically. Instead, she brings the dildo further down, pressing it against your asshole. Slowly, she pushes the tip inside.</p><p>You groan, relaxing your ass so it\u2019s able to go inside more smoothly. \u201cMomo\u2026\u201d</p><p>She forces the dildo further inside you, wanting to see you take it all. \u201cThat\u2019s it, baby.\u201d She coos.</p><p>You whimper at the praise, feeling the dildo stretch the ring of your asshole the furthest it\u2019s been stretched before. You wince at the slight pain, however it ends quickly as the dildo is as deep inside as it can go, Momo only being able to see the widened end of it.</p><p>Unhurriedly, she starts to pull the dildo back, then suddenly, pushes it back in. You moan, wanting her to go faster. She pumps the dildo inside you at a steady pace.</p><p>With her other hand, Momo circles your sensitive clit once more. It feels so good, but your pussy feels so empty.</p><p>\u201cI\u2026 I n-need\u2026\u201d You mumble. \u201cMomo, please, I need-!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSssh.\u201d She interrupted you. \u201cWe\u2019re getting there.\u201d You start to see a faint glow coming from her arm.</p><p><i>It must be her quirk,</i>\u00a0you think. You sigh, knowing that you\u2019re in good hands and Momo\u2019s going to take care of you. Leaning back, you let yourself be carried by the pleasure of something so large moving inside your ass, pressing against all the right places, and the pressure of her fingers gently stroking your sensitivity.</p><p>Suddenly, you feel her hand move away from your clit. About to protest, you stop short upon seeing the\u00a0<i>massive dildo</i>\u00a0she had in her hand. It had to be at least XL or XXL.</p><p>You feel yourself growing wetter at the thought of that going inside you and you moan. \u201cPlease\u2026\u201d You don\u2019t know what you\u2019re asking for, but apparently Momo does. She smiles gently at you, holding the base of the dildo and bringing it to your free entrance.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready?\u201d She asks as if you haven\u2019t been ready the entire time. You only nod.</p><p>Steadily, Momo pushes the dildo inside your neglected cunt. You cry out, the stretch feeling oh-so-good. \u201cMomo!\u201d</p><p>Momo wastes no time in shoving it in the rest of the way and it slides in easily because if how wet you became. You scream, unable to hold it back. With this gigantic dildo inside your pussy paired with the large one in your ass, you felt stuffed.</p><p>You felt the dildo inside your ass started to pick up speed, as well and Momo starting to pump the larger one deep in your pussy. Since both her hands were busy, she brought her head down to lap at your clit, doing figure eights.</p><p>It was too much, you were so full. You moaned unintelligibly, thrusting up against her mouth. The dildos were moving so fast, so deep inside you. You didn\u2019t even know you could be stretched this far, but it felt incredible. You didn\u2019t want it to stop.</p><p>Momo suckles on your clit, pumping the dildos even faster. You feel tears streaming down your face, the knot in your stomach becoming to much to handle.</p><p>\u201cMomo!\u201d You choke, your body starting to shake. \u201cI-I can\u2019t! I\u2019m gonna-!\u201d</p><p>You come undone, everything around you blurring into the background. You feel white, hot pleasure all over you. You pussy and ass clench on the dildos as Momo pushes them in quickly as far as they\u2019ll go. You feel them so deep inside you, nothing left untouched. Suddenly, you feel something start to come out of one of your holes, however you\u2019re too far in orgasmic bliss to know which one.</p><p>You squirt hard, Momo just watching in amazement and adoration. You finally start to come down from your high, your body shivering in the aftershocks of your orgasm. Your eyes focus once more and you look at Momo, questioning.</p><p>\u201cD-Did I-\u201d you stutter. \u201cDid I just\u2026 squirt?\u201d</p><p>Momo chuckles, pulling both dildos out of you at the same time. You moan, feeling your juices spill out and onto the bedsheets.</p><p>\u201cYeah, you did.\u201d She says, \u201cI should make you do it again.\u201d</p><p><b>\u2014-</b></p><p>enjoy another ao3 request lol <i>- shongu</i></p></p>",
