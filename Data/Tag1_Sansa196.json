We last saw Nymeria when Arya made her run away because she wanted to save Nymeria\u2019s life, when Cersei was gonna kill her if she found her. When she finally finds Nymeria again, or Nymeria finds her, and she of course wants her to come back home with her and be her loyal companion again, but Nymeria\u2019s found her own life. &lsquo;That\u2019s not you&rsquo; is a direct reference to what Arya herself said to her father when her father painted this picture for her of this life she could have as a lady of a castle and marrying some lord and wearing a nice frilly dress. Arya\u2019s not domesticated and it makes total sense that her wolf wouldn\u2019t be either and once the wolf walks away, at first she\u2019s heartbroken to have come this close but then she realizes the wolf is doing exactly what she would do if she were that wolf.",
