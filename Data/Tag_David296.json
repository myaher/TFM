You let out an irritated cry and pushed away from the desk, choosing to look out the window instead. You stared out at the Scottish countryside. This cottage get-away was supposed to inspire you, but every word you wrote still felt wrong. Even your trusty notebook wasn\u2019t helping. You noticed that the mug on your desk was almost empty, so you went into the kitchen to refill it with any caffeinated beverage you could find.</p><p>You walked as quietly as you could, not wanting to wake your husband in the other room. It was nearly two in the morning. You often stayed up late trying to write, even if it was to no prevail. You slowly poured coffee into the mug, your mind reeling with ideas.

You let out an irritated cry and pushed away from the desk, choosing to look out the window instead. You stared out at the Scottish countryside. This cottage get-away was supposed to inspire you, but every word you wrote still felt wrong. Even your trusty notebook wasn&rsquo;t helping. You noticed that the mug on your desk was almost empty, so you went into the kitchen to refill it with any caffeinated beverage you could find.</p><p>You walked as quietly as you could, not wanting to wake your husband in the other room. It was nearly two in the morning. You often stayed up late trying to write, even if it was to no prevail. You slowly poured coffee into the mug, your mind reeling with ideas. You had so many ideas for plots and characters and deeper meanings, but you just couldn&rsquo;t put it down on paper.</p><p>&ldquo;What are you doing up?&rdquo; James rubbed his tired eyes, his voice groggy with sleep.</p><p>&ldquo;I just have to find the right words.&rdquo; You sighed, running your fingers through your hair. James blew out a breath.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Have you slept at all in the past two days?&rdquo; You opened your mouth and closed it again, looking down at the floor.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you want the answer to that question.&rdquo; You reached for your mug.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;No, no.&rdquo; James shook his head and plucked the mug from your grasp. &ldquo;You need to sleep.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What I need is caffeine, now give it back.&rdquo; You leaped up to get it back, but he held it up, far out of your reach. Curse his height advantage. He placed the mug atop a high shelf and looked down at your pouting face.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, come on, don&rsquo;t give me that look.&rdquo; He took your hands in his. &ldquo;Come to bed. We can figure this out at a more reasonable hour.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t sleep until I can get all of these thoughts out on paper.&rdquo; You whined.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not going to get anything down except incoherent ramblings unless you let your mind rest.&rdquo; He placed a sweet kiss on your forehead. When you still seemed like you&rsquo;d object, he picked you up and threw you over his shoulder.</p><p>&ldquo;James!&rdquo; You shrieked, and he laughed, carrying you into the bedroom. It wasn&rsquo;t until your head it the pillow that you realized how tired you were. &nbsp;You felt James wrap his arms around you and slowly drifted off to sleep in his embrace.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He was right, of course. When you woke up the next morning, you felt refreshed and more creative than ever. Ideas swam through your head like fish in an endless ocean. Feeling confident, you sat down in front of your notebook, took a sip of apple cider, and picked up the pencil. And. Blanked. Every thought was just <i>poof</i>. Gone.</p><p>You groaned and let your head fall onto the desk. How was this even possible? Just seconds ago you were ready to write a full-fledged novel and now your mind was a desert, with the occasional tumbleweed of a sentence drifting in the wind. You heard a sound from the kitchen and shuffled into the room seeing your husband staring at his typewriter with a blank piece of paper before him.</p><p>&ldquo;Is the great writer James Arber possibly blocked?&rdquo; You teased. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Shut up.&rdquo; He stood up and walked to your, wrapping his arms around your waist. He looked mournfully down at the empty page. &ldquo;Why did we become writers?&rdquo; He sighed. You shrugged.</p><p>&ldquo;Because we didn&rsquo;t want to become barristers.&rdquo; You both laughed. &ldquo;Maybe we could go for a walk? Clear out heads?&rdquo; You suggested and he agreed. It was chilly, but you were both wearing your favorite sweater so you didn&rsquo;t feel the cold. James was wearing his scarf, as always, and you teased him about it, as always.</p><p>Your walk was perfectly pleasant, your fingers intertwined together as the two of you strolled down the grassy path. It really was gorgeous, with the rolling green hills and wildflowers. You took a deep breath, breathing in the fresh, crisp air.</p><p>&ldquo;You were right about this place,&rdquo; James said suddenly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s perfect.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It is beautiful isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; You sighed contently. When you concluded your walk back to the cottage, the two of you got to work. You sat on the floor, back to back as you scribbled away in your notebook you listened to the soothing tap of James&rsquo; typewriter. Occasionally, one of you would get up to bring back snacks or fresh cups of coffee and went back to writing.</p><p>By the time the sun had set you had filled over thirty pages of your notebook and James had a pile of papers of his own. And, abiding by your tradition, you switched, handing the other whatever you had written to let them edit it. As you read James&rsquo; words, your gaze flickered up to him nervously, trying to read his expression as he flipped through the pages of your notebook. But as you took in what he&rsquo;d written, you recognized the main characters and smiled. As you finished, you both set the other&rsquo;s work down and waited for a response.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a really good beginning.&rdquo; He began sincerely. &ldquo;Though, you might want to hold back on having all of the lead&rsquo;s background up front. Let it come forth with the story.&rdquo; You nodded, taking note if his suggestion.</p><p>&ldquo;I like your heroin.&rdquo; You smirked at him. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s courageous, loving, and quite feisty. She&rsquo;ll be a handful for the main character.&rdquo; He gave you a grin.</p><p>&ldquo;They say write about what you know.&rdquo; He winked and you grabbed that stupidly adorable scarf and pulled him in for a kiss.</p></p>",
