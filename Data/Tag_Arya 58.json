He was surrounded by an army it seemed to never be defeated. Winterfell, <i>his home</i>, was <i>falling down</i>. His friends dying one by one. Viseryon destroying the city.

Dany never fought with a weapon. She only fought with her dragons and with words, because she <b><i>is</i></b> a politician. A conqueror, but not a soldier.

I was glowing when Tyrion said they shoud have stayed married. *Waves of feeling*. BUUUT, this is not the bloody point. Sansa is not a warrior, a fighter, much less a soldier. She is a lady. A political woman since when she saw that the world is not a fairy tail, and life is not pretty dresses.

Arya Stark of Winterfell. I just loved her since the beginning of the books and the TV show, and pherhaps my opinion is a little bit blind. I also expected Jon to kill the Night King, but I loved it was her. Plot Twist, baby. I saw some people that was not her character alike. That she is cold and emotionless. That&rsquo;s not truth. She is cold, yes, and cruel all the way. But everything she has ever done was because of her family. To avenge them. She is not emotionless. She has a lot of amotions under the mask of a cold assassin little girl (now a young woman). The thing is: she <span class=\"npf_color_joey\">does not</span> like to show any emotions anymore. For her is weakness. And <b><i>weakness</i></b> get you <b><i>killed</i></b>. She uses a mask of steel. She needs to look strong. In the books she addimited it to herself. The battle of winterfell was this mask being broken<i> </i>and I loved it.</p><p>But okay, that&rsquo;s <i><b><span style=\"color: #000000\">my</span></b></i> opinion. She killing the NK <span class=\"npf_color_ross\"><i>was</i></span> a good idea. It was unexpected, and makes some kind of sense. </p><p><i>&ldquo;How did she fly behind him?&rdquo; &ldquo;How could none of them see her?&rdquo; &ldquo;How did she get there anyway?&rdquo;</i></p><p>Well, I would say to you to rewatch the show. She was trained as a Faceless Man. The most talentous assassins in GoT universe. <i>Includding</i> in the books. She has the skills to do such a thing. <i>Be furtive. </i></p><p>All the others were trained as knights, not killers. </p><h2><i>Arya is </i><b>not</b><i> a Mary Sue, dammit. </i></h2><p>Why do you even think the royalty send assassins when they have good knights? A knight can do the work, obviously, but would be catch easily what can start a war deppending of the situation.</p><p>The mistakes of the battle? Well, it was too short, even knowing that the TV Show, different from the books, is much more about who sits on the Iron Throne than the Night King itself, I guess it should have be a longer battle. With <i>days</i> of fighting. More despair. More loses. Not just one night. But okay, I hope that in the books the writer will work better on that. </p><p>But, I want to remember. It&rsquo;s a <i><b>war</b></i>. Everyone fighting is a hero. Every single one of them all. <b><i><span class=\"npf_color_joey\">Stop</span></i></b> saying one character is more important than another, &rsquo;<i>cause they are not.</i> If battles could be won with just one person, we wold not have soldiers. We remember the leaders and the ones who ended the war, but we forget that without the warriors, a leader would do nothing, and <i>&ldquo;</i><b>The</b><i> Hero&rdquo;</i> would never exist.</p><p>This is all.

Let&rsquo;s make some things clear. I heard a lot of people saying that Dany and Jon were useless in this battle. This is wrong. Like <b><i>BULLSHIT</i></b>. The dragons&rsquo;ve done a lot. Burrying the White Walkers, for an example? The Night King appeared with Viseryon and made a winter storm<span style=\"color: #000000\"><b><i> or foggy  </i></b>(is this correct?)<b><i> They could&rsquo;t see nothing!!! </i></b></span></p><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"0\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><p>I give you, the battle scene &ldquo;Dragons vs Dragon&rdquo; was amazing and realistic.</p><p>Of course that was cool to see Jon riding a dragon, but he almost fell like, a <i>thousand times</i>. I think it would be more interesting see him fighting with Ghost side by side. He is much more a Stark than a Targaryen after all. But I have to adimit, it was an amazing scene. </p><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"1\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><p>Jon <i>could</i> have done more, I agree. But this is what I like in GoT. They are humans and show their failures is something I like to watch. Shows that even a hero is not invencible. Put yourself in Jon&rsquo;s place. He was surrounded by an army it seemed to never be defeated. Winterfell, <i>his home</i>, was <i>falling down</i>. His friends dying one by one. Viseryon destroying the city. Not knowing if the rest of his family is ok. Think racionally in this situation is almost impossible.</p><p>Dany <i>is</i> strong. Not phisically, but mentally. She is a valient queen. Her dothoraki and army were devastaed in that fight. She lost Viseryon <i>and</i> Jorah. When she fell from Drogon, I totally tought she would die, then her loyalest knight came to save her, and instead of <i>hide</i> beside him, he took a damm sword and fought along side Sor Jorah. I do like Daenarys, she is not my fav one, but I like her. More than ever. </p><p>Take a sword and fight is not easy. It&rsquo;s terrifying. You need be brave to do it. Dany never fought with a weapon. She only fought with her dragons and with words, because she <b><i>is</i></b> a politician. A conqueror, but not a soldier.
