Everything was going great. You took the\nback country roads, Taehyung driving a little too fast, the windows rolled down\nas you hung your hand out, feeling the cool breeze tousle your hair while\nlooking at the pretty purple sundown. That is until Taehyung&rsquo;s car broke down\nand just refused to start again, no matter how much he poked at it under the\nhood.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 &ldquo;Nothing\nwas wrong with it, okay! How would I know it would break down in the middle of nowhere?&rdquo;\nHe raised his voice at you too as he took off his baseball cap, \u00a0wiped the sweat from his forehead, ran his\nhand through his hair and let the lid of the car drop down with a loud bang.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s\nnot get mad at each other.

You were parked off a back road in the countryside, only fields and\nwoods in sight. </p><!-- more --><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 &ldquo;I&rsquo;m\ncalling road service. Not a single car has passed in the last hour.

But this actually isn&rsquo;t bad. Look how\npretty the scenery is&rdquo; Tae said smiling, looking ahead at the forest, his\neyes sparkling like a little kid&rsquo;s. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 &ldquo;I guess\nyou&rsquo;re right. We haven&rsquo;t really had alone time like this in a while&rdquo; You\nsaid, marveling at the raindrops sliding down the windshield and disappearing\nin the hood of the car.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 You felt\nTaehyung move his hand carefully to sweep you hair back and caress your cheek\nlightly. You locked eyes with him and noticed that he looked at you with desire\nnow, licking his lips. He pulled you in closer and pressed his lips against\nyours. He kissed you slowly, biting your bottom lip and then running his tongue\nover it as if to soothe it. His hands tangled in your hair, pulling at it\nlightly, making you whimper against his lips, before moving down and settling\non your waist. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 You lifted\nyour leg and swung over to straddle Taehyung in the driver seat. He deepened\nthe kiss, sliding his tongue in your mouth, while his hands dropped to your\nass, squeezing it roughly under your dress. You noticed the windows have now\nfogged up, creating a blurry curtain.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 You felt\nneediness creep into you and you started rolling your hips down on Taehyung. He\nbroke the kiss to let out a deep moan and rest his head back as you felt him\nharden underneath you. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 His big hands\nwent to your breasts, massaging them harshly over your bra and clothes. He let\none of his hands drop down your stomach and slide up the hem of your dress\nbefore going to your heat. You moaned and leaned back against the steering\nwheel. He started rubbing circles over your clothed clit. He watched you\nsquirming at this slightest touch, watched how you were slowly going crazy\nbecause of him and he enjoyed every moment of it. He pulled your panties to the\nside and slowly slid a finger inside you, looking at your expressions the whole\ntime. Your hands went to his chest for support, feeling like you\u00b4re spinning.\nHe started pumping slowly while you got wetter and was already almost dripping\ndown his hand. He added another finger in and you leaned into him, crashing you\nlips on his, needing to feel more of him. You moaned into the kiss, feeling\nyour high getting closer with each move of his fingers. You started moving your\nhips in sync with his fingers, trying to get more. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s\nright babygirl, fuck yourself on my fingers, just like that.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You were\nbouncing up and down on his fingers at this point, pulling at his hair, burying\nyour face in his neck while getting louder and louder. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 You heard the rain fall down more\nheavily on the hood of the car now and tried to focus on the calming sound of\nit instead of your dangerously close orgasm. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cLet\u2019s cool\noff\u201d Taehyung said with a hint of a smile, grabbing your head and making you\nlook at him, making you shiver despite the intense heat in the car.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 You looked at\nhim questioningly, not getting what he meant right away. \u00a0</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He\nopened the door and gave you a light push, gesturing you to get out before\nfollowing you. As you were both standing there under the rain, it finally\nclicked in your brain. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He slammed\nyou against the door of the car, your back immediately getting soaked because\nof the rain. He started kissing you. It was sloppier than before, you could\ntaste his desperation. It was pouring now, you felt your hair and your dress stick\nto your skin, but you didn\u2019t mind it at all. Tae was making your body was so\nhot that the rain falling down on you felt soothing. \u00a0</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Teahyung\nmoved his hands down to your hips and lifted you as you wrapped your legs\naround him. He carried you to the front of the car, never breaking the kiss. He\nset you down on the hood, running his hands through your hair, now soaking wet.\nYou pulled back a little to look at him. His hair was dripping too, his uneven\nbreath coming out of his slightly parted lips. Raindrops were rolling down his\nbody, making his thin white shirt cling to him, becoming see-through, making <i>every </i>detail of him visible to you. You\nfelt your panties cling to you but you weren\u2019t sure if it was the rain to blame\nfor this. He pulled down the straps of your dress before tugging at the\nneckline. He pulled your bra down too, exposing your breasts to the rain, which\nmade them glisten, while the cool summer breeze made your nipples hard. Tae apparently\nliked what he saw, you noticed his eyes shine in the dark, before he took one\nof your nipples in his mouth, biting at it and rolling his tongue around it. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Taehyung placed\nhis hand on your shoulder, pushing you back to lay down a little. You rested\nback on your elbows while looking up at the sky, the tops of the trees in the\nnearby forest, and the rain falling down on your face. \u00a0</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Taehyung\nunzipped his pants, tugging them down. He pushed you panties to the side again,\nnot bothering to take them off, before spreading your legs open slowly while\ngliding his palm down your wet thigh, squeezing lightly. He leaned in, placing\nhis hands on either side of you. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Tae\u2019s eyes\nwere glued to yours as he rubbed his dick over your slit a couple of times,\nteasing you, watching you squirm under him, before pushing in slowly. He stayed\nlike that for a couple of seconds, trying to collect himself and calm his\nbreathing. He buried his face in your neck as he pulled slightly out and slammed\nback in you again. He started fucking you slowly but deeply as if trying to\nsavor every moment of it. Every move of his hips felt so good, you never wanted\nit to end. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 It started\nraining even more and you found it hard trying not to slip off the car.\nTaehyung noticed and brought you down. He turned you around and bent you\nslightly, gathering the fabric of your dress and scrunching it behind your\nback. You leaned on your palms against the hood as you lifted one of your legs\na little and put it on the bumper. Taehyung started thrusting in you from\nbehind, pulling at your dress, almost tearing it off of you, before his arms\nwrapped around your body, over your neck and breasts, trying to keep you as\nclose as possible. His fingers found your wet breasts and he started to pinch\nand play with your nipples, before settling one of his hands around your throat, making you gasp for air because of his strong grip. He was now going harder on you, the rain falling\ndown on you adding on to the pleasure. Your moans, Teahyung\u2019s deep grunts and\nthe lewd noises of him smashing against your wet body was all that was heard in\nthis secluded place, as if you two were the only ones in the universe in that\nmoment. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Taehyung\npushed you forward, pinning you to the hood, the cold steel of the car against\nyour sensitive nipples making you shiver all over. He grabbed your soaked hair\nand arched you back a little as he leaned over you, breathing near your ear, your\nname leaving his lips, driving you insane and pushing you closer to your edge.\nOne of his hands dropped down to your clit, rubbing in slow, hard circles. His\ntouch made you scream louder, almost echoing through the vast open space. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cCome on,\ncum for me, pretty thing, soak my dick even more\u201d Taehyung\u2019s breath tickled\nyour neck, before running his lips over it, biting ever so slightly, pushing\nyou completely over the edge. \u00a0 </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 You felt a\nwave of pleasure wash over you, trembling in Taehyung\u2019s arms. Your knees were\nweak and he was the only thing keeping you upright as he met his own end,\nriding it out slowly, you name on his lips and his hands squeezing you hard as\nIf worried you\u2019d disappear. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 You leaned\nback against him as you both tried to catch your breaths, just standing there,\nletting the rain wash over you.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 You got in\nthe car while Tae fumbled for something in the trunk, coming back with a\nblanket.

But this actually isn\u2019t bad. Look how\npretty the scenery is\u201d Tae said smiling, looking ahead at the forest, his\neyes sparkling like a little kid\u2019s. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cI guess\nyou\u2019re right. We haven\u2019t really had alone time like this in a while\u201d You\nsaid, marveling at the raindrops sliding down the windshield and disappearing\nin the hood of the car.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 You felt\nTaehyung move his hand carefully to sweep you hair back and caress your cheek\nlightly. You locked eyes with him and noticed that he looked at you with desire\nnow, licking his lips. He pulled you in closer and pressed his lips against\nyours. He kissed you slowly, biting your bottom lip and then running his tongue\nover it as if to soothe it. His hands tangled in your hair, pulling at it\nlightly, making you whimper against his lips, before moving down and settling\non your waist. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 You lifted\nyour leg and swung over to straddle Taehyung in the driver seat. He deepened\nthe kiss, sliding his tongue in your mouth, while his hands dropped to your\nass, squeezing it roughly under your dress. You noticed the windows have now\nfogged up, creating a blurry curtain.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 You felt\nneediness creep into you and you started rolling your hips down on Taehyung. He\nbroke the kiss to let out a deep moan and rest his head back as you felt him\nharden underneath you. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 His big hands\nwent to your breasts, massaging them harshly over your bra and clothes. He let\none of his hands drop down your stomach and slide up the hem of your dress\nbefore going to your heat. You moaned and leaned back against the steering\nwheel. He started rubbing circles over your clothed clit. He watched you\nsquirming at this slightest touch, watched how you were slowly going crazy\nbecause of him and he enjoyed every moment of it. He pulled your panties to the\nside and slowly slid a finger inside you, looking at your expressions the whole\ntime. Your hands went to his chest for support, feeling like you\u00b4re spinning.\nHe started pumping slowly while you got wetter and was already almost dripping\ndown his hand. He added another finger in and you leaned into him, crashing you\nlips on his, needing to feel more of him. You moaned into the kiss, feeling\nyour high getting closer with each move of his fingers. You started moving your\nhips in sync with his fingers, trying to get more. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s\nright babygirl, fuck yourself on my fingers, just like that.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You were\nbouncing up and down on his fingers at this point, pulling at his hair, burying\nyour face in his neck while getting louder and louder. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 You heard the rain fall down more\nheavily on the hood of the car now and tried to focus on the calming sound of\nit instead of your dangerously close orgasm. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cLet\u2019s cool\noff\u201d Taehyung said with a hint of a smile, grabbing your head and making you\nlook at him, making you shiver despite the intense heat in the car.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 You looked at\nhim questioningly, not getting what he meant right away. \u00a0</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He\nopened the door and gave you a light push, gesturing you to get out before\nfollowing you. As you were both standing there under the rain, it finally\nclicked in your brain. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He slammed\nyou against the door of the car, your back immediately getting soaked because\nof the rain. He started kissing you. It was sloppier than before, you could\ntaste his desperation. It was pouring now, you felt your hair and your dress stick\nto your skin, but you didn\u2019t mind it at all. Tae was making your body was so\nhot that the rain falling down on you felt soothing. \u00a0</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Teahyung\nmoved his hands down to your hips and lifted you as you wrapped your legs\naround him. He carried you to the front of the car, never breaking the kiss. He\nset you down on the hood, running his hands through your hair, now soaking wet.\nYou pulled back a little to look at him. His hair was dripping too, his uneven\nbreath coming out of his slightly parted lips. Raindrops were rolling down his\nbody, making his thin white shirt cling to him, becoming see-through, making <i>every </i>detail of him visible to you. You\nfelt your panties cling to you but you weren\u2019t sure if it was the rain to blame\nfor this. He pulled down the straps of your dress before tugging at the\nneckline. He pulled your bra down too, exposing your breasts to the rain, which\nmade them glisten, while the cool summer breeze made your nipples hard. Tae apparently\nliked what he saw, you noticed his eyes shine in the dark, before he took one\nof your nipples in his mouth, biting at it and rolling his tongue around it. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Taehyung placed\nhis hand on your shoulder, pushing you back to lay down a little. You rested\nback on your elbows while looking up at the sky, the tops of the trees in the\nnearby forest, and the rain falling down on your face. \u00a0</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Taehyung\nunzipped his pants, tugging them down. He pushed you panties to the side again,\nnot bothering to take them off, before spreading your legs open slowly while\ngliding his palm down your wet thigh, squeezing lightly. He leaned in, placing\nhis hands on either side of you. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Tae\u2019s eyes\nwere glued to yours as he rubbed his dick over your slit a couple of times,\nteasing you, watching you squirm under him, before pushing in slowly. He stayed\nlike that for a couple of seconds, trying to collect himself and calm his\nbreathing. He buried his face in your neck as he pulled slightly out and slammed\nback in you again. He started fucking you slowly but deeply as if trying to\nsavor every moment of it. Every move of his hips felt so good, you never wanted\nit to end. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 It started\nraining even more and you found it hard trying not to slip off the car.\nTaehyung noticed and brought you down. He turned you around and bent you\nslightly, gathering the fabric of your dress and scrunching it behind your\nback. You leaned on your palms against the hood as you lifted one of your legs\na little and put it on the bumper. Taehyung started thrusting in you from\nbehind, pulling at your dress, almost tearing it off of you, before his arms\nwrapped around your body, over your neck and breasts, trying to keep you as\nclose as possible. His fingers found your wet breasts and he started to pinch\nand play with your nipples, before settling one of his hands around your throat, making you gasp for air because of his strong grip. He was now going harder on you, the rain falling\ndown on you adding on to the pleasure. Your moans, Teahyung\u2019s deep grunts and\nthe lewd noises of him smashing against your wet body was all that was heard in\nthis secluded place, as if you two were the only ones in the universe in that\nmoment. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Taehyung\npushed you forward, pinning you to the hood, the cold steel of the car against\nyour sensitive nipples making you shiver all over. He grabbed your soaked hair\nand arched you back a little as he leaned over you, breathing near your ear, your\nname leaving his lips, driving you insane and pushing you closer to your edge.\nOne of his hands dropped down to your clit, rubbing in slow, hard circles. His\ntouch made you scream louder, almost echoing through the vast open space. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cCome on,\ncum for me, pretty thing, soak my dick even more\u201d Taehyung\u2019s breath tickled\nyour neck, before running his lips over it, biting ever so slightly, pushing\nyou completely over the edge. \u00a0 </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 You felt a\nwave of pleasure wash over you, trembling in Taehyung\u2019s arms. Your knees were\nweak and he was the only thing keeping you upright as he met his own end,\nriding it out slowly, you name on his lips and his hands squeezing you hard as\nIf worried you\u2019d disappear. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 You leaned\nback against him as you both tried to catch your breaths, just standing there,\nletting the rain wash over you.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 You got in\nthe car while Tae fumbled for something in the trunk, coming back with a\nblanket. He threw it over your shoulders, pulling you closer as he kissed your\nwet hair.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWe should\nhave car trouble more often\u201d He said, grinning at you devilishly. </p></p>",

When he heard your little sniffle and saw your tears, though, he rolled you over to look at you, using his thumbs to wipe away stray tears. &ldquo;Hey,&rdquo; he whispered quietly as you buried your face in his neck, his hands coming up to run through your hair. &ldquo;Shh, it&rsquo;s ok.

He smiled softly when he saw you, coming over to wrap his arms around your waist and bury his head in your neck. &ldquo;I know you&rsquo;ve been feeling out of sorts, lately,&rdquo; he said quietly. &ldquo;But you don&rsquo;t have to be sad alone.

It only lasted for a minute, though, as he opened his arms invitingly and you nearly tripped on your own feet in your haste to get to him.
