And even in the show, I interpreted her reaction as her compartmentalizing her feelings and trying to not show emotion rather than her reveling in his painful death. Plus, in the show, since she\u2019s older, Dany\u00a0(rightfully) states that she\u2019s been sold and raped and abused but in the books, she\u2019s so young that after their deaths, even though Viserys and Drogo treated her horrifically, she romanticizes them to the point she names her dragons after them as well as her (shitty) brother Rhaegar.\u00a0</p><p>But yeah, I saw the criticism about Sansa and Arya killing Littlefinger and I was like\u2026. the dude was the reason their father was MURDERED, he killed their aunt, and started the War of the Five Kings, all because he was in love with their mother! In the show, he sold Sansa to Ramsay and although he sold Jeyne Poole to the Boltons in the books, book!Sansa will not be happy when she finds that out and I hope that she\u2019s the reason book!Littlefinger dies as well.\u00a0He deserved to die and the fact that Arya slit his throat was probably the most humane way to do it since he died quickly. Plus, another difference between them executing Littlefinger and Dany burning King\u2019s Landing is that Littlefinger is one man who was the reason for so much suffering, not hundreds of thousands of civilians.</p>",

All of our faculty are professional commercial artists -- cartoonists, illustrators, animators, and designers.
