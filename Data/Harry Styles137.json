He watched you turn in the bed with an annoyed sigh. He felt his\nchest tighten as you flicked your bedside light on, your annoyed look turning\nto an angry one in a second.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing in my room?\u201d Taking a few steps, he came\nin closer but you slid back on the bed until you couldn\u2019t go any further. </p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t show up, so I came to talk to you.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to see you.\u201d You said, glaring at Harry as he\nsat down on the end of your bed. </p><p>\u201cWhy? What did I do? I can\u2019t fix whatever happened if you\ndon\u2019t tell me.\u201d His voice was tense as he looked at you.

I wouldn\u2019t lie to\nyou, never.\u201d He wanted to add that it hurt to much having you look at him like\nthat but decided it wasn\u2019t the right time. </p><p>Grabbing your phone, you went through your texts with your\nbest friend, finding the link that broke your heart. Handing him your phone you\ntook in a shaky breath, you were past shedding tears over him. </p><p>\u201cLovely present for our first Christmas together.\u201d</p><p>He was confused more then ever now as he read through the\narticle quickly. The headline was telling enough and he was pissed at the moron\nwho wrote it but he would have to save that for later.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s an old photo, my hairs longer now, look.\u201d Handing\nyour phone back he watched you carefully as you surveyed the photo and then him\nsitting in front of you. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t cheat on you.\u201d</p><p>You were quiet as you stared at your phone. The article had\nhurt you and it wasn\u2019t going to be something you got over quickly. You had\nnever loved someone like you loved Harry. He made you feel safe and comfortable\nand then your friend sent you this text and you looked him at in a different\nlight. It wasn\u2019t something you wanted to believe and in the haze of it all you\ncouldn\u2019t see the different hair length. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Harry said after a while and you hadn\u2019t said\nanything. \u201cJeff normally keeps an eye on it all. Makes sure nothing is\npublished or tells me when it does, must have missed this one, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Lifting his hand up he rested it on your foot closest to\nhim, you flinched a bit but didn\u2019t pull away from him completely. Taking a deep\nbreath, you looked up to the roof and wiped away at the few tears. Harry slid\nup to sit beside you, hand wrapping around yours.</p><p>\n\n\u201cPlease come to me if something like that\nhappens. Shit is always being said about me so tell me and I\u2019ll clear it all up\nfor you.\u201d he squeezed your hand and you gave it a gentle squeeze back because\nyou didn\u2019t know what to say back to him but you felt better having it all cleared\nup and sat next to you.\n\n\n\n</p></p>",
