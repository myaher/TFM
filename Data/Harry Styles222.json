There&rsquo;s something we need to talk about later on.</i></b></p><p>Harry felt a thug at his heart as he skimmed over the text his girlfriend had sent him. Perhaps he was wrong, perhaps he made a mistake and he <i>was</i> going to apologise; but <i>&ldquo;This could get rough&rdquo;</i> Harry thought to himself.</p><p>There was two more hours before he could go home, but ever since he had received the text, Harry dreaded each passing minute. Thoughts started overflowing his brain; he was thinking of ways to apologise, because maybe he <i>was</i> wrong but at the time, Harry wasn\u2019t quite aware of it.\u00a0</p><!-- more --><p><i>It was a Sunday, or rather cleaning-day in Y/N\u2019s and Harry\u2019s household. They hadn\u2019t been living together for too long, but since every now and then one would have slept over at the others place, after two years of dating it was time to move in.\u00a0</i><i>That Sunday was their fourth Sunday together in their new place and with moving came a lot of boxes and quite the mess, but with each week it was less messy and more home-y.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>Harry would always be the one to clean the kitchen and the living room, while Y/N took care of the bedrooms and bathrooms, and well, Y/N hated doing the dishes so when Harry said that he would be taking care of them, it was a blessing.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>The last boxes Y/N unpacked were their clothes for the closet, but as she was first unpacking her clothes and putting them into its place, she noticed an unusual box </i>already<i> in the closet but in Harry\u2019s bit. \u2018\u2019Maybe it\u2019s his jewellery\u2019\u2019, she thought. It was probably out because Harry didn\u2019t want to go through ten boxes just to find some of his rings, so he put them into one box and places them on the top shelf, right?</i></p><p><i>Y/N reached for the box she had never seen before, and opened it. It was filled with some kind of pictures and letters, but turning the pictures around Y/N noticed they were rather personal and romantic pictures. The problem was, it wasn\u2019t Y/N on the pictures. Some of them had a date behind, there were two different necklaces and one ring, as well as handwritten notes which Y/N decided not to read.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>Her mind became a small mess, and her heart was on the verge of breaking. The box was still in her hand, shaking due to her hands shaking, as she got out of the room and headed towards the kitchen where Harry was.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u2018\u2018What is this?\u2019\u2018 Harry turned to face her as he heard his girlfriend speak in an unusual tone of voice.\u00a0<br/></i></p><p><i>\u2018\u2018Oh that\u2019s just a box.\u2019\u2018 He said nonchalantly, drying his hands with a small towel.\u00a0<br/></i></p><p><i>\u2018\u2018I don\u2019t think it\u2019s <b>just</b> a box&hellip;\u2019\u2019 Y/N answered coyly,\u00a0\u2018\u2018It\u2019s rather&hellip; personalised.\u2019\u2019 Her voice was small and shy, not wanting to cause trouble but wanting to know about it because it did hurt her.</i></p><p><i>\u2018\u2019I\u2019m just like keeping them around, nothing special.\u2019\u2019 He shrugged his shoulders, turning around and continuing with the unboxing.\u00a0\u00a0<br/></i></p><p><i>\u2018\u2018Harry.. It\u2019s not nothing. You have a box of..\u2019\u2018 Y/N was confused, and the more he answered with short replies the more it hurt her,\u00a0\u2018\u2018a box with memories of your ex-girlfriend.\u2019\u2018 She avoided saying that sentence because she actually didn\u2019t want to believe it was that.\u00a0<br/></i></p><p><i>\u2018\u2018Bloody hell, yes it\u2019s a box. Yes there\u2019s pictures of me and my ex, but it\u2019s literally nothing. Stop making a big deal out of it.\u2019\u2018<br/></i></p><p><i>\u2018\u2018I\u2019m not trying to..\u2019\u2018, despite him snapping at her, she continued to speak lowly and slowly,\u00a0\u2018\u2018It\u2019s &hellip; I never even knew you had this box and-\u2019\u2018<br/></i></p><p><i>\u2018\u2018Because you don\u2019t need to know about it, or well, didn\u2019t, since you snooped and found it.\u2019\u2018 Harry waved his hands in frustration, not seeing the problem. So what, he kept the box, why wouldn\u2019t he? It\u2019s a part of my life - He thought to himself.\u00a0<br/></i></p><p><i>\u2018\u2018Okay. I-I\u2019m sorry for bothering you. And snooping.\u2019\u2018 Y/N hung her had low in embarrassment, turning around and leaving the kitchen.\u00a0<br/></i></p><p><i>She put the box in its place and went to the bathroom, locking herself in. Sliding down the door, tears stared to form in her eyes and slowly fall down her cheeks. Y/N was never insecure about their relationship, nor did she ever doubt Harry\u2019s love for her, but finding a box of memories and pictures of his ex-girlfriend was something else. It was the fact that that specific ex-girlfriend wasn\u2019t his last before he started dating Y/N, it was the one that completely broke his heart. It was the one that made Harry doubt each woman in his life, even Y/N. It was that she was the reason Y/N and Harry\u2019s relationship took a little longer than it would have if he hadn\u2019t had that rough break up with his ex.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>As Harry was cleaning and unpacking boxes, Y/N was in the bathroom breaking and crying, but he wasn\u2019t aware of that.\u00a0</i></p><p>Recalling the memory of what was the beginning of their biggest fight, Harry shook his head at how stupid he had acted. Of course it was a big deal. He kept a box of memories with a girl that broke his heart, the same girl that made him doubt Y/N\u2019s intentions and her, who had been the best thing to ever happen to him. Of course it wasn\u2019t just a box, it\u2019s a box filled with pictures of his ex, for fuck\u2019s sake.\u00a0</p><p>Harry buried his head into his hands, trying to stop himself from crying because he knew tonight was going to be rough. He quickly replied to Y/N\u2019s text before anxiously waiting for her reply.\u00a0</p><p><i>To Y/N: <b>Of course, baby. I love you.x</b></i></p><p>But there was no reply.</p><p><i>Since the beginning of their relationship, Y/N and Harry had this thing where at least one time a week, they would go to a cafe order two coffees and two muffins and just talk. And on those little dates, they talked about anything without picking an argument or being judged, not that either of them ever judged the other, but it was their time to be alone while in a crowd.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>Although this date was different. Ever since the box, things had been a bit off, at least to Y/N because it seemed like Harry didn\u2019t notice much. He didn\u2019t really notice how every night Y/N cried, nor how she didn\u2019t lean into him while sleeping like she always did. Maybe he had noticed, but Harry never said anything.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>But of course them waiting in a line couldn\u2019t go without a blast from the past. She just had to reappear in the weakest time of their relationship.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u2018\u2018Hey you!\u2019\u2018 A voice behind the said, in an excited tone, causing them to turn around.\u00a0\u2018\u2018How have you been?\u2019\u2018<br/></i></p><p><i>\u2018\u2018T-Tori, hey! I\u2019m good, yeah, Yourself?\u2019\u2019 Harry replied, looking straight into his ex\u2019s eyes, with a small smile on his face, while Y/N stood frozen next to him wanting to leave every second.\u00a0</i><br/></p><p><i>\u2018\u2018I\u2019m alright. I\u2019m back in London for a few days, so that\u2019s good yeah.\u2019\u2018<br/></i></p><p><i>\u2018\u2018Oh that\u2019s great, how is your family? That\u2019s why you\u2019re back, right?\u2019\u2018\u00a0<br/></i></p><p><i>\u2018\u2018Yeah yeah, they\u2019re good. They mention you from time to time actually. You should visit some time while I\u2019m still here.\u2019\u2018 It was obvious to Y/N that Tori was flirting with him, and yet Harry let her. She fluttered her eyes at him, sent him cheeky smiles, swayed while talking to him - it was obvious.\u00a0<br/></i></p><p><i>\u2018\u2018Ah, I\u2019ll see. Maybe I do. I\u2019m a bit busy right now. But I will let you know.\u2019\u2018 He chuckled at her.<br/></i></p><p><i>\u2018\u2018If I didn\u2019t know any better, I\u2019d say it\u2019s like still know each other.\u2019\u2018 Neither of them acknowledged Y/N, not Tori but also not Harry.\u00a0\u2018\u2019Still keeping the box?\u2019\u2019 Tori asked, hopefully.</i></p><p><i>\u2018\u2018Yeah, it\u2019s like we never faded, so I never really threw it out.\u2019\u2018 At this point, Y/N turned around leaving both of them alone. She could hear Harry calling after her, but she straight up ignored him and ran. Tears streamed down her face, blurring her vision, but not once did she stop running until she was in a small park far too away from Harry.\u00a0<br/></i></p><p><i>Her phone kept ringing and blowing up with messages, but she ignored those too. She was sitting all alone on a bench, just looking up the sky being insecure about herself and their relationship, something that had never happened before.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>Being alone and sitting on that bench made her furious the more she kept thinking. Having an urge to hurt Harry the same way he had hurt her.\u00a0</i></p><p>Harry\u2019s thoughts were interrupted when someone walked into his office. His friend was standing by the door, holding some files in his hand and the doorknob with the other.\u00a0</p><p>\u2018\u2018You ready for the meeting?\u2019\u2018 His friend asked suspiciously, seeing the state of him.<br/></p><p>\u2018\u2018Is there any way I could skip this one?\u2019\u2018 Harry\u2019s voice was a whisper, his head still in his hands.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u2018\u2018Are you, are you alright mate?\u2019\u2018 Jack closed the door behind him, taking a seat in front of Harry at his desk.<br/></p><p>\u2018\u2018Y/N is gonna break up with me.\u2019\u2018 He looked up, meeting his friends concerned eyes that widened in surprise as he answered him.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u2018\u2018What? Why? I mean, why do you think that? Wait, <i>how</i> do you know that?\u2019\u2018<br/></p><p>\u2018\u2018Because I\u2019m a stupid shit and I just fuck up. Because that\u2019s what I am, a fuck up.\u2019\u2018\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u2018\u2018What did you do? If you don\u2019t mind me asking&hellip;\u2019\u2018\u00a0<br/></p><p>Harry\u00a0briefly explained the situation to his friend, not wanting to seem like he was complaining but still keeping it detailed.\u00a0</p><p><i>After many failed attempts of reaching her, calling and texting her even driving around certain spots he thought he was going to find her, Harry gave up and went back to their place. He still kept calling her every five minutes, just wanting to know she\u2019s safe, but Y/N had ignore each attempt.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>To Y/N: <b>Please tell me where you are.</b></i></p><p><i>To Y/N: <b>come home, please.</b>\u00a0</i></p><p><i>To Y/N: <b>please come home, i want us to talk</b></i></p><p><i>To Y/N: <b>i want us to be okay, please baby.</b>\u00a0</i></p><p><i>To Y/N: <b>i\u2019m so sorry</b></i></p><p><i>To Y/N: <b>i love you much, okay? you\u2019re the love of my life, please come back to me</b></i></p><p><i>To Y/N: <b>please</b></i></p><p><i>There was many more texts but not once did she reply. But sitting on their bed with the godforsaken box in his lap, he heard a ding on his phone, immediately reaching for it only to feel even more like shit and ever more broken.</i></p><p><i>From Y/N:<b> Stop texting me. You\u2019re annoying.\u00a0</b></i></p><p><i>Harry threw the box at the fall, watching it break into pieces just like his heart was. The pictures flew around and the metal jewellery hit the floor. He was sat on the floor with his back against the bed, with tears falling down his face the whole night before Y/N finally returned.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>When he heard the doors open, Harry immediately got up, running down the stairs to greet her, but he was in for a surprise because it was Y/N standing in front of the door, but it wasn\u2019t <b>his</b> Y/N. Because the Y/N standing in the living room had a stern look on her face, her eyes filled with anger and a brown box in her hands.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u2018\u2018Hello, Harry.\u2019\u2018 Her voice was reeking of sarcasm, accompanied with a very sarcastic and evil smile on her face.\u00a0<br/></i></p><p><i>\u2018\u2018Hi baby..\u2019\u2018 Harry\u2019s voice was small, carefully coming closer to her, tiptoeing.\u00a0<br/></i></p><p><i>\u2018\u2018How have you been? Because I had a fantastic day, I even went down a little memory lane, you know? And it was sooo good.\u2019\u2018 The smile never went away and her voice kept being more evil with each second.\u00a0\u2018\u2018Wanna see?\u2019\u2018 She quickly added, pushing the box in front of her, nodding at it.\u00a0<br/></i></p><p><i>\u2018\u2018I\u2019m-I, um, I\u2019m not sure what to say right now&hellip;\u2019\u2018<br/></i></p><p><i>\u2018\u2018Oh! Don\u2019t you worry! Here let\u2019s sit, yeah?\u2019\u2018 Y/N sat down on the couch, opening the box quickly and taking out some pictures and setting them on the table.\u00a0\u2018\u2018Oh my, I remember this day like it was yesterday! Sit and listen, yeah? So this day we actually went on a our first date and it was the day of our first kiss too, you know? So David said maybe we should take a picture to remember it, right? But as I was snapping the picture he kissed me, so it\u2019s a picture of us kissing.\u2019\u2018 Y/N explained, pushing the picture down the table of her and her ex-boyfriend kissing, while taking another out.\u00a0<br/></i></p><p><i>\u2018\u2018Oh this one is a bit.. exposing but hey! It was one morning after we woke up, obviously I was half naked, and it was the morning selfie, you know? But that was a nice day, because I met his family then and we had lots of s-\u2019\u2018<br/></i></p><p><i>\u2018\u2018Stop! Stop talking!\u2019\u2018 Harry snapped, not wanting to listen to her stories about her ex-boyfriend.\u00a0\u2018\u2019I get it, okay?! I fucking get it.\u2019\u2019 Once again, tears streamed down his face.</i></p><p><i>\u2018\u2018What\u2019s wrong, Harry? I mean, it\u2019s just a box.\u2019\u2018<br/></i></p><p><i>\u2018\u2018No, no it\u2019s not just a fucking box. You <b>know</b> I hate him, you know I <b>hate </b>your stupid ex-boyfriend. You. Know.\u2019\u2018 The wasn\u2019t as much anger in his voice as there was pain.\u00a0\u2018\u2018And where the hell did you even get these pictures? Didn\u2019t you delete them all? Why do you still have them?\u2019\u2018</i></p><p><i>\u2018\u2018Isn\u2019t that a bit hypocritical, you know, coming from you?\u2019\u2018\u00a0<br/></i></p><p><i>\u2018\u2018No it\u2019s not. And do not ignore my question.\u2019\u2018<br/></i></p><p><i>\u2018\u2018But it is. Because you have the same box, you <b>kept</b> the box, so why can\u2019t I have one of my own? I mean, why would you make a big deal out of it?\u2019\u2018<br/></i></p><p><i>\u2018\u2018I get it, okay? You\u2019re getting your way back at me. I was wrong and you were right. Can we stop this nonsense now?\u2019\u2018 He rubbed his eyes, feeling even shittier than before. His voice was low and he wasn\u2019t snapping at her anymore.\u00a0<br/></i></p><p><i>\u2018\u2018Sure, I\u2019mma go to bed now, go through some more memories. You do what you wanna do.\u2019\u2018 Packing the pictures into the box, Y/N stood up heading towards the stairs to go to the guest bedroom, because there was no chance she was going to sleep next to him tonight. But Harry had other plans; he snatched the box from her hands and threw it away, making Y/N jump in surprise.\u00a0<br/></i></p><p><i>\u2018\u2018You\u2019re not taking the box with you. We\u2019re gonna throw it out tomorrow, Hell, I\u2019m gonna throw it out now.\u2019\u2018<br/></i></p><p><i>\u2018\u2018No you\u2019re not.\u2019\u2019 Even though Y/N wasn\u2019t always the stubborn one, she wouldn\u2019t let this one slide. She crouched down, picking the stuff and putting it into its place.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u2018\u2018Yes I am, stop picking that shit up.\u2019\u2018 He crouched down next to her, taking the stuff away from her, ready to throw it once again.\u00a0<br/></i></p><p><i>\u2018\u2018No, you don\u2019t get it. You\u2019re not gonna throw it out. I don\u2019t care that you hate my ex. Who knows? Maybe he comes back to me one day, so I won\u2019t have to print them out again, maybe it will be like <b>we never faded</b>.\u2019\u2018\u00a0<br/></i></p><p><i>\u2018\u2018Stop. Stop. Stop.\u2019\u2018 He kept rubbing his tears away, his heart breaking with each tear,\u00a0\u2018\u2018Just stop, please?\u2019\u2018 He begged her,\u00a0\u2018\u2018you\u2019re hurting me, please, stop.\u2019\u2018\u00a0<br/></i></p><p><i>\u2018\u2018What about me? What about the fact that you\u2019ve hurt me, hm?\u2019\u2018 Y/N asked him, crossing her arms in front of her.<br/></i></p><p><i>\u2018\u2018I\u2019m sorry, okay? I will throw the box away, and I\u2019ll donate the jewellery. Just please stop, I\u2019m sorry.\u2019\u2018\u00a0<br/></i></p><p><i>\u2018\u2018You\u2019re sorry?\u2019\u2018 A sarcastic chuckle escaped her lips, making Harry look up and meet her gaze, her sad but angry gaze.\u00a0\u2018\u2019You\u2019re sorry. Great, everything is perfect again. Yay. Go us.\u2019\u2019 She put her hand up, mocking the victory fist.\u00a0\u2018\u2019You\u2019re unbelievable, you know?\u2019\u2019 It was the last thing she said before she went to the guest bedroom and locked herself in. She left the box in the living room because all she wanted to do was cry and just call herself stupid. Doubt herself, doubt everything, break from inside out.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>Harry didn\u2019t follow after her, instead he took the box going over the pictures because he couldn\u2019t help himself. With each picture, he hated her ex even more. It made him furious and sad at the same time, because that <b>wasn\u2019t him</b>. He knew that back then, they didn\u2019t even know each other but the fact that there was a time where she wasn\u2019t his hurt him, because now she was the love of his life. He couldn\u2019t imagine a life without her, but he had fucked up. He had realised how stupid he had been, how she must have felt when she found that stupid box of his.\u00a0</i></p><p>\u2018\u2018I don\u2019t think she is going to break up with you, but I think she is just really mad at you, because don\u2019t get me wrong but you did fuck up.\u2019\u2018 Harry\u2019s friend, Jack said.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u2018\u2018You don\u2019t get it. That was four days ago and she left. Like she\u2019s perhaps staying in the same place as I am, but it\u2019s like she isn\u2019t there. Not once did she text me or call me, she doesn\u2019t sleep in the same bed as me. She just&hellip; left me, maybe not physically, but mentally. It\u2019s like she just gave up on me, you know.. which I get because I deserve it&hellip;\u2019\u2018 Harry was ranting to his best friend, because he didn\u2019t speak to anyone about the whole fight, not even his mum.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u2018\u2018Wait, so if she\u2019s so mad at you, how come you were supposed to go out on a date tonight? Before she cancelled, of course.\u2019\u2018<br/></p><p>\u2018\u2018I don\u2019t know..\u2019\u2018 He brushed his hand through his hair,\u00a0\u2018\u2018I do, it\u2019s just&hellip; I asked her friend if she could ask Y/N for a double date, you know? But of course, it wasn\u2019t going to be a double date, because they weren\u2019t going to show up, and it was gonna be just Y/N and I.\u2019\u2018\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u2018\u2018Don\u2019t you think that she kinda caught onto that? Because I\u2019m pretty sure Y/N isn\u2019t as stupid.\u2019\u2018<br/></p><p>\u2018\u2018She probably did, that\u2019s why she probably asked me to cancel.\u2019\u2018\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u2018\u2018Go home, right now.\u2019\u2018 Jack insisted,\u00a0\u2018\u2018Leave, fuck the meeting. Go buy her flowers and go apologise because you were a right dick.\u2019\u2019</p><p>Harry just nodded his head and did exactly that. He bought her a big bouquet of flowers and some chocolate and drove home. The silence as he drove was killing him and he was so anxious and nervous.\u00a0</p><p>When he got home, he was worn to the bones. He locked the door and headed towards the living room, but he was her sitting down in front of the counter looking at him.\u00a0</p><p>\u2018\u2018Hey.\u2019\u2018 Harry said, coming closer to her and putting the flowers and the chocolate in front of her,\u00a0\u2018\u2018These are for you.\u2019\u2018 He smiled softly at her, trying to ease the tension.\u00a0</p><p>\u2018\u2018I wasn\u2019t aware you were gonna be back earlier.\u2019\u2018 Y/N replied, not acknowledging the flowers.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u2018\u2018I-I, yeah, I just didn\u2019t have much to do, so I came home.\u2019\u2018 Y/N winced at the word home, because was it? Was this <i>a home</i>?<br/></p><p>\u2018\u2018I hate when you\u2019re lying.\u2019\u2018 She looked straight into his eyes because she knew he had quite the important meeting today.\u00a0</p><p>\u2018\u2018I, um.. sorry.. I just wanted to come home&hellip;\u2019\u2018 He hung his head low, feeling the heat of his cheeks,\u00a0\u2018\u2018come home to you.\u2019\u2018 He whispered.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u2018\u2018Do you think, the fact that it took us this long to move in together is actually a sign that maybe we never should have?\u2019\u2018 Y/N asked, looking down at her lap fidgeting with her hands.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u2018\u2018What? No, no, no. No! That was not a sign.\u2019\u2018 He waved his hands and shook his head at her,\u00a0\u2018\u2018No, it was just we were always so busy to have some proper time to actually move. We\u2019ve spent so much time at each others places, it\u2019s just we never had time to pack and move to our own place.\u2019\u2018 His heart was beating at an unusual speed, fearing her next words.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u2018\u2018I think it was.\u2019\u2018<br/></p><p>\u2018\u2018No, Y/N stop.\u2019\u2018 Harry came closer, putting his hands on her hips only to be pushed away.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u2018\u2018Please don\u2019t touch me.\u2019\u2018 Y/N moved away from him, hugging herself tightly.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u2018\u2018Baby..\u2019\u2018 he was hurt, his heart hurt,\u00a0\u2018\u2018Please. Do not think that, please.\u2019\u2018<br/></p><p>\u2018\u2018You know, I never doubted you, or our love, or anything really.\u2019\u2018 She looked out of the window before adding,\u00a0\u2018\u2018But in the past week or two, I\u2019ve doubted everything.\u2019\u2018<br/></p><p>\u2018\u2018You shouldn\u2019t, because I love you. More than anything in this world. You can call mum if you want to, because she is gonna tell you that I <i>never shut up</i> about you. You\u2019re the love of my life, okay? And that&hellip; the past week has been a lot but it was a simple mistake, not something that should break us apart.\u2019\u2019\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u2018\u2018A simple mistake?\u2019\u2018 She narrowed her eyes, looking at him,\u00a0\u2018\u2018if a <i>simple </i>mistake like that could make me doubt everything, from myself to you, your love and to our relationship. Then I don\u2019t want to know what a big mistake could do to us.\u2019\u2018<br/></p><p>\u2018\u2018I-I didn\u2019t mean it like that, I\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s just, please do no doubt me, okay? You <i>know</i> I love you more than anything. You should know that, because there isn\u2019t anyone I love as much as you.\u2019\u2018 He took a step towards her, but still keeping the distance because he was afraid of her stepping back.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u2018\u2018Maybe we should take a small break from each other.\u2019\u2018 She stated, no emotions on her face.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u2018\u2018No! I\u2019m not- we\u2019re not breaking up. No!\u2019\u2018\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u2018\u2018I didn\u2019t say a break up, but we should separate from each other for&hellip; a little while.\u2019\u2018 Y/N couldn\u2019t dare to look at him, because if she did, she would break down.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u2018\u2018Separate? You didn\u2019t even look at me for the last five days, not once! That\u2019s enough of a separation. You didn\u2019t even sleep next to me. So we\u2019re not doing that. We\u2019re gonna be okay, do you hear me? We will talk. Tonight, we\u2019re gonna talk all night and we <i>will </i>be okay.\u2019\u2018 He was scared, because if they take a break, he knew that would be the first step to a break up, and he wasn\u2019t having any of that.\u00a0</p><p>\u2018\u2018We\u2019ve said enough, Harry. There is nothing more to be said.\u2019\u2018<br/></p><p>\u2018\u2018Yes there is. There is so much I want to say to you and the most important bit is how much I love you.\u2019\u2018 Coming closer to her, Y/N kept taking steps back until she hit the wall. Harry was standing right in front of her, hovering over her body.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u2018\u2018Stop, please just move.\u2019\u2018<br/></p><p>\u2018\u2018No, baby, I-I can\u2019t.\u2019\u2018 He leaned down his forehead against hers.\u00a0\u2018\u2018Please let us talk. I love you.\u2019\u2018 Harry whispered, but Y/N only sighed and closed her eyes.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u2018\u2018This isn\u2019t good for us, Harry.\u2019\u2018<br/></p><p>\u2018\u2018But it\u2019s love, and it\u2019s supposed to hurt. That\u2019s what love is, love is pain.\u2019\u2018</p><p>\u2018\u2018No! It isn\u2019t! It\u2019s not supposed to hurt this much! This isn\u2019t love! This is pain, and there is so much of it that I cannot handle it!\u2019\u2018 She wanted to push him away, but she just had no strength.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u2018\u2018Then let\u2019s hurt tonight. Let\u2019s hurt together. Let\u2019s go to bed, lock the door and hit the lights. We\u2019re not gonna leave the room until we resolve our problem. They say love is pain, so let\u2019s hurt.\u2019\u2018<br/></p><p>\u2018\u2018I don\u2019t want to, Harry, because I\u2019m already hurt enough and I don\u2019t want to hurt even more.\u2019\u2018 There was no sarcasm in her voice or anger, it was just sad and low.<br/></p><p>\u2018\u2018Let\u2019s say all the things we couldn\u2019t before. If you want to yell, then yell, if you wanna cry, I will hold you and cry with you. Hell, if you want to punch something, I\u2019ll even let you punch me or just hold up a pillow for you. But please do not give up on us.\u2019\u2019 His hands found their way up to her hips, holding her closer; his body completely pressed against hers.\u00a0</p><p>\u2018\u2018I\u2019m tired Harry. So tired.\u2019\u2018 She trailed her hand up his chest, placing it just above his heart, feeling the speed it was beating at.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u2018\u2018And I\u2019m tired of sleeping alone, because I need you and I am not ready to lose you. I won\u2019t lose you.\u2019\u2018 He put his hand over her cheek, brushing the tears away.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u2018\u2018I threw the box away, and sold the jewellery and donated the money from it. The box is gone, okay? She never meant anything to me, it was just there. That box isn\u2019t important.\u2019\u2018 Harry added, reassuring her that he was hers, and he was always going to be hers.\u00a0\u2018\u2018My heart belongs to you. I\u2019d give my life for you, I\u2019d even give my life <i>to</i> you.\u2019\u2018<br/></p><p>\u2018\u2018Let\u2019s go to bed.\u2019\u2018 Y/N spoke, for the first time in a while. She wiggled away from his grip, heading towards their bedroom but waiting for him to join her.\u00a0</p><p>They were sitting on their bed, backs pressed against the board, neither of them saying anything. But Harry was holding her hand, brushing his thumb over it lightly and placing kisses from time to time.\u00a0</p><p>\u2018\u2018Do you know why I asked for a place with four bedrooms and not only one or two?\u2019\u2018 Harry suddenly asked and Y/N just shook her head.\u00a0\u2018\u2019Because I want a family.\u2019\u2019 He looked over to her, meeting her eyes,\u00a0\u2018\u2019I want a family with you one day and I wish for it to be soon. Not right now or next month, but soon because that\u2019s all I want.\u2019\u2019\u00a0</p><p>\u2018\u2018You want a family with me?\u2019\u2018 Her eyes widened in surprise because this topic never came up before and she indeed was surprised.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u2018\u2018I wanna marry you, Y/N. Of course I\u2019d want a family too. My mum has been nagging too, surprised she didn\u2019t send you pictures of baby clothes to hint she wants a grandchild.\u2019\u2018<br/></p><p>\u2018\u2018Oh.. I-I.. I didn\u2019t know that&hellip;\u2019\u2018<br/></p><p>\u2018\u2018That\u2019s because you found the wrong box. I know I hurt you a lot, and please forgive me for that. I was really stupid to say those things because I get it and I just cannot get over the fact how much I hurt you.\u2019\u2018 Turning to face her, he placed her in his lap and softly stroked her cheek with his thumb.\u00a0\u2018\u2018But you found the wrong box. I know you weren\u2019t <i>searching</i>, but I wish you found the other one. The more important one.\u2019\u2018<br/></p><p>Y/N\u2019s mind was running wild, and her heart beating so fast. She felt like shaking because Harry just admitted to having a box&hellip;with a ring in it. Her eyes were wide as she kept looking at Harry, trying to see if he was messing around or really serious.</p><p>\u2018\u2018I\u2019m not lying, I promise you.\u2019\u2018 He placed her down on the bed before going inside the closed to take the red velvet box and place it in front of her. He crossed his legs as he sat down.\u00a0\u2018\u2018Do you want to open it?\u2019\u2018 Harry carefully asked, scared out of his mind. Y/N carefully took the box in her hand and opened it. There was a silver ring with<i> love</i> written on it; it was similar to his <i>peace</i> one, but this one wasn\u2019t as wide and it was smaller.\u00a0</p><p>\u2018\u2018I\u2019m begging you, do not ever doubt my love for you again because you truly are the love of my life. I know I\u2019ve fucked up and maybe this isn\u2019t the best timing but please, just let me have you. Forever.\u2019\u2018 Harry took the box from her, placing it on the bed while he took her hand hovering with the ring over her finger.\u00a0\u2018\u2018Marry me, Y/N. Let me be the man you deserve, let me love you for the rest of my life. Let me be the best father to our children. Please, I will be all of those things, just please, will you marry me?\u2019\u2018 He was on the verge of crying but he contained himself. Hope in his eyes and his voice, as he waited for Y/N\u2019s answer.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u2018\u2018Yes, I will marry you. A hundred times, yes.\u2019\u2018 Harry\u2019s heart burst out of happiness when she answered the way he wanted her to.</p><p>\u2018\u2018I love you. I love you. I love you.\u2019\u2018 He leaned himself and hugged her tightly,\u00a0\u2018\u2018I love you so fucking much. Thank you.\u2019\u2019 Placing kisses all over her face, he couldn\u2019t calm himself down because of happy he was.\u00a0</p><p>\u2018\u2019I love you more.\u2019\u2019 Y/N replied through his hungry kisses.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0</p><p><i>Love was pain, and they did hurt, but that bit of pain was good because now they had each other and they were never gonna let go.\u00a0</i></p>",

Thoughts started overflowing his brain; he was thinking of ways to apologise, because maybe he <i>was</i> wrong but at the time, Harry wasn\u2019t quite aware of it.\u00a0</p>[[MORE]]<p><i>It was a Sunday, or rather cleaning-day in Y/N\u2019s and Harry\u2019s household. They hadn\u2019t been living together for too long, but since every now and then one would have slept over at the others place, after two years of dating it was time to move in.\u00a0</i><i>That Sunday was their fourth Sunday together in their new place and with moving came a lot of boxes and quite the mess, but with each week it was less messy and more home-y.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>Harry would always be the one to clean the kitchen and the living room, while Y/N took care of the bedrooms and bathrooms, and well, Y/N hated doing the dishes so when Harry said that he would be taking care of them, it was a blessing.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>The last boxes Y/N unpacked were their clothes for the closet, but as she was first unpacking her clothes and putting them into its place, she noticed an unusual box </i>already<i> in the closet but in Harry\u2019s bit. \u2018\u2019Maybe it\u2019s his jewellery\u2019\u2019, she thought. It was probably out because Harry didn\u2019t want to go through ten boxes just to find some of his rings, so he put them into one box and places them on the top shelf, right?</i></p><p><i>Y/N reached for the box she had never seen before, and opened it. It was filled with some kind of pictures and letters, but turning the pictures around Y/N noticed they were rather personal and romantic pictures. The problem was, it wasn\u2019t Y/N on the pictures. Some of them had a date behind, there were two different necklaces and one ring, as well as handwritten notes which Y/N decided not to read.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>Her mind became a small mess, and her heart was on the verge of breaking. The box was still in her hand, shaking due to her hands shaking, as she got out of the room and headed towards the kitchen where Harry was.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u2018\u2018What is this?\u2019\u2018 Harry turned to face her as he heard his girlfriend speak in an unusual tone of voice.\u00a0<br></i></p><p><i>\u2018\u2018Oh that\u2019s just a box.\u2019\u2018 He said nonchalantly, drying his hands with a small towel.\u00a0<br></i></p><p><i>\u2018\u2018I don\u2019t think it\u2019s <b>just</b> a box\u2026\u2019\u2019 Y/N answered coyly,\u00a0\u2018\u2018It\u2019s rather\u2026 personalised.\u2019\u2019 Her voice was small and shy, not wanting to cause trouble but wanting to know about it because it did hurt her.</i></p><p><i>\u2018\u2019I\u2019m just like keeping them around, nothing special.\u2019\u2019 He shrugged his shoulders, turning around and continuing with the unboxing.\u00a0\u00a0<br></i></p><p><i>\u2018\u2018Harry.. It\u2019s not nothing. You have a box of..\u2019\u2018 Y/N was confused, and the more he answered with short replies the more it hurt her,\u00a0\u2018\u2018a box with memories of your ex-girlfriend.\u2019\u2018 She avoided saying that sentence because she actually didn\u2019t want to believe it was that.\u00a0<br></i></p><p><i>\u2018\u2018Bloody hell, yes it\u2019s a box. Yes there\u2019s pictures of me and my ex, but it\u2019s literally nothing. Stop making a big deal out of it.\u2019\u2018<br></i></p><p><i>\u2018\u2018I\u2019m not trying to..\u2019\u2018, despite him snapping at her, she continued to speak lowly and slowly,\u00a0\u2018\u2018It\u2019s \u2026 I never even knew you had this box and-\u2019\u2018<br></i></p><p><i>\u2018\u2018Because you don\u2019t need to know about it, or well, didn\u2019t, since you snooped and found it.\u2019\u2018 Harry waved his hands in frustration, not seeing the problem. So what, he kept the box, why wouldn\u2019t he? It\u2019s a part of my life - He thought to himself.\u00a0<br></i></p><p><i>\u2018\u2018Okay. I-I\u2019m sorry for bothering you. And snooping.\u2019\u2018 Y/N hung her had low in embarrassment, turning around and leaving the kitchen.\u00a0<br></i></p><p><i>She put the box in its place and went to the bathroom, locking herself in. Sliding down the door, tears stared to form in her eyes and slowly fall down her cheeks. Y/N was never insecure about their relationship, nor did she ever doubt Harry\u2019s love for her, but finding a box of memories and pictures of his ex-girlfriend was something else. It was the fact that that specific ex-girlfriend wasn\u2019t his last before he started dating Y/N, it was the one that completely broke his heart. It was the one that made Harry doubt each woman in his life, even Y/N. It was that she was the reason Y/N and Harry\u2019s relationship took a little longer than it would have if he hadn\u2019t had that rough break up with his ex.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>As Harry was cleaning and unpacking boxes, Y/N was in the bathroom breaking and crying, but he wasn\u2019t aware of that.\u00a0</i></p><p>Recalling the memory of what was the beginning of their biggest fight, Harry shook his head at how stupid he had acted. Of course it was a big deal. He kept a box of memories with a girl that broke his heart, the same girl that made him doubt Y/N\u2019s intentions and her, who had been the best thing to ever happen to him. Of course it wasn\u2019t just a box, it\u2019s a box filled with pictures of his ex, for fuck\u2019s sake.\u00a0</p><p>Harry buried his head into his hands, trying to stop himself from crying because he knew tonight was going to be rough. He quickly replied to Y/N\u2019s text before anxiously waiting for her reply.\u00a0</p><p><i>To Y/N: <b>Of course, baby. I love you.x</b></i></p><p>But there was no reply.</p><p><i>Since the beginning of their relationship, Y/N and Harry had this thing where at least one time a week, they would go to a cafe order two coffees and two muffins and just talk. And on those little dates, they talked about anything without picking an argument or being judged, not that either of them ever judged the other, but it was their time to be alone while in a crowd.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>Although this date was different. Ever since the box, things had been a bit off, at least to Y/N because it seemed like Harry didn\u2019t notice much. He didn\u2019t really notice how every night Y/N cried, nor how she didn\u2019t lean into him while sleeping like she always did. Maybe he had noticed, but Harry never said anything.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>But of course them waiting in a line couldn\u2019t go without a blast from the past. She just had to reappear in the weakest time of their relationship.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u2018\u2018Hey you!\u2019\u2018 A voice behind the said, in an excited tone, causing them to turn around.\u00a0\u2018\u2018How have you been?\u2019\u2018<br></i></p><p><i>\u2018\u2018T-Tori, hey! I\u2019m good, yeah, Yourself?\u2019\u2019 Harry replied, looking straight into his ex\u2019s eyes, with a small smile on his face, while Y/N stood frozen next to him wanting to leave every second.\u00a0</i><br></p><p><i>\u2018\u2018I\u2019m alright. I\u2019m back in London for a few days, so that\u2019s good yeah.\u2019\u2018<br></i></p><p><i>\u2018\u2018Oh that\u2019s great, how is your family? That\u2019s why you\u2019re back, right?\u2019\u2018\u00a0<br></i></p><p><i>\u2018\u2018Yeah yeah, they\u2019re good. They mention you from time to time actually. You should visit some time while I\u2019m still here.\u2019\u2018 It was obvious to Y/N that Tori was flirting with him, and yet Harry let her. She fluttered her eyes at him, sent him cheeky smiles, swayed while talking to him - it was obvious.\u00a0<br></i></p><p><i>\u2018\u2018Ah, I\u2019ll see. Maybe I do. I\u2019m a bit busy right now. But I will let you know.\u2019\u2018 He chuckled at her.<br></i></p><p><i>\u2018\u2018If I didn\u2019t know any better, I\u2019d say it\u2019s like still know each other.\u2019\u2018 Neither of them acknowledged Y/N, not Tori but also not Harry.\u00a0\u2018\u2019Still keeping the box?\u2019\u2019 Tori asked, hopefully.</i></p><p><i>\u2018\u2018Yeah, it\u2019s like we never faded, so I never really threw it out.\u2019\u2018 At this point, Y/N turned around leaving both of them alone. She could hear Harry calling after her, but she straight up ignored him and ran. Tears streamed down her face, blurring her vision, but not once did she stop running until she was in a small park far too away from Harry.\u00a0<br></i></p><p><i>Her phone kept ringing and blowing up with messages, but she ignored those too. She was sitting all alone on a bench, just looking up the sky being insecure about herself and their relationship, something that had never happened before.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>Being alone and sitting on that bench made her furious the more she kept thinking. Having an urge to hurt Harry the same way he had hurt her.\u00a0</i></p><p>Harry\u2019s thoughts were interrupted when someone walked into his office. His friend was standing by the door, holding some files in his hand and the doorknob with the other.\u00a0</p><p>\u2018\u2018You ready for the meeting?\u2019\u2018 His friend asked suspiciously, seeing the state of him.<br></p><p>\u2018\u2018Is there any way I could skip this one?\u2019\u2018 Harry\u2019s voice was a whisper, his head still in his hands.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u2018\u2018Are you, are you alright mate?\u2019\u2018 Jack closed the door behind him, taking a seat in front of Harry at his desk.<br></p><p>\u2018\u2018Y/N is gonna break up with me.\u2019\u2018 He looked up, meeting his friends concerned eyes that widened in surprise as he answered him.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u2018\u2018What? Why? I mean, why do you think that? Wait, <i>how</i> do you know that?\u2019\u2018<br></p><p>\u2018\u2018Because I\u2019m a stupid shit and I just fuck up. Because that\u2019s what I am, a fuck up.\u2019\u2018\u00a0<br></p><p>\u2018\u2018What did you do? If you don\u2019t mind me asking\u2026\u2019\u2018\u00a0<br></p><p>Harry\u00a0briefly explained the situation to his friend, not wanting to seem like he was complaining but still keeping it detailed.\u00a0</p><p><i>After many failed attempts of reaching her, calling and texting her even driving around certain spots he thought he was going to find her, Harry gave up and went back to their place. He still kept calling her every five minutes, just wanting to know she\u2019s safe, but Y/N had ignore each attempt.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>To Y/N: <b>Please tell me where you are.</b></i></p><p><i>To Y/N: <b>come home, please.</b>\u00a0</i></p><p><i>To Y/N: <b>please come home, i want us to talk</b></i></p><p><i>To Y/N: <b>i want us to be okay, please baby.</b>\u00a0</i></p><p><i>To Y/N: <b>i\u2019m so sorry</b></i></p><p><i>To Y/N: <b>i love you much, okay? you\u2019re the love of my life, please come back to me</b></i></p><p><i>To Y/N: <b>please</b></i></p><p><i>There was many more texts but not once did she reply. But sitting on their bed with the godforsaken box in his lap, he heard a ding on his phone, immediately reaching for it only to feel even more like shit and ever more broken.</i></p><p><i>From Y/N:<b> Stop texting me. You\u2019re annoying.\u00a0</b></i></p><p><i>Harry threw the box at the fall, watching it break into pieces just like his heart was. The pictures flew around and the metal jewellery hit the floor. He was sat on the floor with his back against the bed, with tears falling down his face the whole night before Y/N finally returned.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>When he heard the doors open, Harry immediately got up, running down the stairs to greet her, but he was in for a surprise because it was Y/N standing in front of the door, but it wasn\u2019t <b>his</b> Y/N. Because the Y/N standing in the living room had a stern look on her face, her eyes filled with anger and a brown box in her hands.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u2018\u2018Hello, Harry.\u2019\u2018 Her voice was reeking of sarcasm, accompanied with a very sarcastic and evil smile on her face.\u00a0<br></i></p><p><i>\u2018\u2018Hi baby..\u2019\u2018 Harry\u2019s voice was small, carefully coming closer to her, tiptoeing.\u00a0<br></i></p><p><i>\u2018\u2018How have you been? Because I had a fantastic day, I even went down a little memory lane, you know? And it was sooo good.\u2019\u2018 The smile never went away and her voice kept being more evil with each second.\u00a0\u2018\u2018Wanna see?\u2019\u2018 She quickly added, pushing the box in front of her, nodding at it.\u00a0<br></i></p><p><i>\u2018\u2018I\u2019m-I, um, I\u2019m not sure what to say right now\u2026\u2019\u2018<br></i></p><p><i>\u2018\u2018Oh! Don\u2019t you worry! Here let\u2019s sit, yeah?\u2019\u2018 Y/N sat down on the couch, opening the box quickly and taking out some pictures and setting them on the table.\u00a0\u2018\u2018Oh my, I remember this day like it was yesterday! Sit and listen, yeah? So this day we actually went on a our first date and it was the day of our first kiss too, you know? So David said maybe we should take a picture to remember it, right? But as I was snapping the picture he kissed me, so it\u2019s a picture of us kissing.\u2019\u2018 Y/N explained, pushing the picture down the table of her and her ex-boyfriend kissing, while taking another out.\u00a0<br></i></p><p><i>\u2018\u2018Oh this one is a bit.. exposing but hey! It was one morning after we woke up, obviously I was half naked, and it was the morning selfie, you know? But that was a nice day, because I met his family then and we had lots of s-\u2019\u2018<br></i></p><p><i>\u2018\u2018Stop! Stop talking!\u2019\u2018 Harry snapped, not wanting to listen to her stories about her ex-boyfriend.\u00a0\u2018\u2019I get it, okay?! I fucking get it.\u2019\u2019 Once again, tears streamed down his face.</i></p><p><i>\u2018\u2018What\u2019s wrong, Harry? I mean, it\u2019s just a box.\u2019\u2018<br></i></p><p><i>\u2018\u2018No, no it\u2019s not just a fucking box. You <b>know</b> I hate him, you know I <b>hate </b>your stupid ex-boyfriend. You. Know.\u2019\u2018 The wasn\u2019t as much anger in his voice as there was pain.\u00a0\u2018\u2018And where the hell did you even get these pictures? Didn\u2019t you delete them all? Why do you still have them?\u2019\u2018</i></p><p><i>\u2018\u2018Isn\u2019t that a bit hypocritical, you know, coming from you?\u2019\u2018\u00a0<br></i></p><p><i>\u2018\u2018No it\u2019s not. And do not ignore my question.\u2019\u2018<br></i></p><p><i>\u2018\u2018But it is. Because you have the same box, you <b>kept</b> the box, so why can\u2019t I have one of my own? I mean, why would you make a big deal out of it?\u2019\u2018<br></i></p><p><i>\u2018\u2018I get it, okay? You\u2019re getting your way back at me. I was wrong and you were right. Can we stop this nonsense now?\u2019\u2018 He rubbed his eyes, feeling even shittier than before. His voice was low and he wasn\u2019t snapping at her anymore.\u00a0<br></i></p><p><i>\u2018\u2018Sure, I\u2019mma go to bed now, go through some more memories. You do what you wanna do.\u2019\u2018 Packing the pictures into the box, Y/N stood up heading towards the stairs to go to the guest bedroom, because there was no chance she was going to sleep next to him tonight. But Harry had other plans; he snatched the box from her hands and threw it away, making Y/N jump in surprise.\u00a0<br></i></p><p><i>\u2018\u2018You\u2019re not taking the box with you. We\u2019re gonna throw it out tomorrow, Hell, I\u2019m gonna throw it out now.\u2019\u2018<br></i></p><p><i>\u2018\u2018No you\u2019re not.\u2019\u2019 Even though Y/N wasn\u2019t always the stubborn one, she wouldn\u2019t let this one slide. She crouched down, picking the stuff and putting it into its place.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u2018\u2018Yes I am, stop picking that shit up.\u2019\u2018 He crouched down next to her, taking the stuff away from her, ready to throw it once again.\u00a0<br></i></p><p><i>\u2018\u2018No, you don\u2019t get it. You\u2019re not gonna throw it out. I don\u2019t care that you hate my ex. Who knows? Maybe he comes back to me one day, so I won\u2019t have to print them out again, maybe it will be like <b>we never faded</b>.\u2019\u2018\u00a0<br></i></p><p><i>\u2018\u2018Stop. Stop. Stop.\u2019\u2018 He kept rubbing his tears away, his heart breaking with each tear,\u00a0\u2018\u2018Just stop, please?\u2019\u2018 He begged her,\u00a0\u2018\u2018you\u2019re hurting me, please, stop.\u2019\u2018\u00a0<br></i></p><p><i>\u2018\u2018What about me? What about the fact that you\u2019ve hurt me, hm?\u2019\u2018 Y/N asked him, crossing her arms in front of her.<br></i></p><p><i>\u2018\u2018I\u2019m sorry, okay? I will throw the box away, and I\u2019ll donate the jewellery. Just please stop, I\u2019m sorry.\u2019\u2018\u00a0<br></i></p><p><i>\u2018\u2018You\u2019re sorry?\u2019\u2018 A sarcastic chuckle escaped her lips, making Harry look up and meet her gaze, her sad but angry gaze.\u00a0\u2018\u2019You\u2019re sorry. Great, everything is perfect again. Yay. Go us.\u2019\u2019 She put her hand up, mocking the victory fist.\u00a0\u2018\u2019You\u2019re unbelievable, you know?\u2019\u2019 It was the last thing she said before she went to the guest bedroom and locked herself in. She left the box in the living room because all she wanted to do was cry and just call herself stupid. Doubt herself, doubt everything, break from inside out.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>Harry didn\u2019t follow after her, instead he took the box going over the pictures because he couldn\u2019t help himself. With each picture, he hated her ex even more. It made him furious and sad at the same time, because that <b>wasn\u2019t him</b>. He knew that back then, they didn\u2019t even know each other but the fact that there was a time where she wasn\u2019t his hurt him, because now she was the love of his life. He couldn\u2019t imagine a life without her, but he had fucked up. He had realised how stupid he had been, how she must have felt when she found that stupid box of his.\u00a0</i></p><p>\u2018\u2018I don\u2019t think she is going to break up with you, but I think she is just really mad at you, because don\u2019t get me wrong but you did fuck up.\u2019\u2018 Harry\u2019s friend, Jack said.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u2018\u2018You don\u2019t get it. That was four days ago and she left. Like she\u2019s perhaps staying in the same place as I am, but it\u2019s like she isn\u2019t there. Not once did she text me or call me, she doesn\u2019t sleep in the same bed as me. She just\u2026 left me, maybe not physically, but mentally. It\u2019s like she just gave up on me, you know.. which I get because I deserve it\u2026\u2019\u2018 Harry was ranting to his best friend, because he didn\u2019t speak to anyone about the whole fight, not even his mum.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u2018\u2018Wait, so if she\u2019s so mad at you, how come you were supposed to go out on a date tonight? Before she cancelled, of course.\u2019\u2018<br></p><p>\u2018\u2018I don\u2019t know..\u2019\u2018 He brushed his hand through his hair,\u00a0\u2018\u2018I do, it\u2019s just\u2026 I asked her friend if she could ask Y/N for a double date, you know? But of course, it wasn\u2019t going to be a double date, because they weren\u2019t going to show up, and it was gonna be just Y/N and I.\u2019\u2018\u00a0<br></p><p>\u2018\u2018Don\u2019t you think that she kinda caught onto that? Because I\u2019m pretty sure Y/N isn\u2019t as stupid.\u2019\u2018<br></p><p>\u2018\u2018She probably did, that\u2019s why she probably asked me to cancel.\u2019\u2018\u00a0<br></p><p>\u2018\u2018Go home, right now.\u2019\u2018 Jack insisted,\u00a0\u2018\u2018Leave, fuck the meeting. Go buy her flowers and go apologise because you were a right dick.\u2019\u2019</p><p>Harry just nodded his head and did exactly that. He bought her a big bouquet of flowers and some chocolate and drove home. The silence as he drove was killing him and he was so anxious and nervous.\u00a0</p><p>When he got home, he was worn to the bones. He locked the door and headed towards the living room, but he was her sitting down in front of the counter looking at him.\u00a0</p><p>\u2018\u2018Hey.\u2019\u2018 Harry said, coming closer to her and putting the flowers and the chocolate in front of her,\u00a0\u2018\u2018These are for you.\u2019\u2018 He smiled softly at her, trying to ease the tension.\u00a0</p><p>\u2018\u2018I wasn\u2019t aware you were gonna be back earlier.\u2019\u2018 Y/N replied, not acknowledging the flowers.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u2018\u2018I-I, yeah, I just didn\u2019t have much to do, so I came home.\u2019\u2018 Y/N winced at the word home, because was it? Was this <i>a home</i>?<br></p><p>\u2018\u2018I hate when you\u2019re lying.\u2019\u2018 She looked straight into his eyes because she knew he had quite the important meeting today.\u00a0</p><p>\u2018\u2018I, um.. sorry.. I just wanted to come home\u2026\u2019\u2018 He hung his head low, feeling the heat of his cheeks,\u00a0\u2018\u2018come home to you.\u2019\u2018 He whispered.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u2018\u2018Do you think, the fact that it took us this long to move in together is actually a sign that maybe we never should have?\u2019\u2018 Y/N asked, looking down at her lap fidgeting with her hands.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u2018\u2018What? No, no, no. No! That was not a sign.\u2019\u2018 He waved his hands and shook his head at her,\u00a0\u2018\u2018No, it was just we were always so busy to have some proper time to actually move. We\u2019ve spent so much time at each others places, it\u2019s just we never had time to pack and move to our own place.\u2019\u2018 His heart was beating at an unusual speed, fearing her next words.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u2018\u2018I think it was.\u2019\u2018<br></p><p>\u2018\u2018No, Y/N stop.\u2019\u2018 Harry came closer, putting his hands on her hips only to be pushed away.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u2018\u2018Please don\u2019t touch me.\u2019\u2018 Y/N moved away from him, hugging herself tightly.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u2018\u2018Baby..\u2019\u2018 he was hurt, his heart hurt,\u00a0\u2018\u2018Please. Do not think that, please.\u2019\u2018<br></p><p>\u2018\u2018You know, I never doubted you, or our love, or anything really.\u2019\u2018 She looked out of the window before adding,\u00a0\u2018\u2018But in the past week or two, I\u2019ve doubted everything.\u2019\u2018<br></p><p>\u2018\u2018You shouldn\u2019t, because I love you. More than anything in this world. You can call mum if you want to, because she is gonna tell you that I <i>never shut up</i> about you. You\u2019re the love of my life, okay? And that\u2026 the past week has been a lot but it was a simple mistake, not something that should break us apart.\u2019\u2019\u00a0<br></p><p>\u2018\u2018A simple mistake?\u2019\u2018 She narrowed her eyes, looking at him,\u00a0\u2018\u2018if a <i>simple </i>mistake like that could make me doubt everything, from myself to you, your love and to our relationship. Then I don\u2019t want to know what a big mistake could do to us.\u2019\u2018<br></p><p>\u2018\u2018I-I didn\u2019t mean it like that, I\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s just, please do no doubt me, okay? You <i>know</i> I love you more than anything. You should know that, because there isn\u2019t anyone I love as much as you.\u2019\u2018 He took a step towards her, but still keeping the distance because he was afraid of her stepping back.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u2018\u2018Maybe we should take a small break from each other.\u2019\u2018 She stated, no emotions on her face.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u2018\u2018No! I\u2019m not- we\u2019re not breaking up. No!\u2019\u2018\u00a0<br></p><p>\u2018\u2018I didn\u2019t say a break up, but we should separate from each other for\u2026 a little while.\u2019\u2018 Y/N couldn\u2019t dare to look at him, because if she did, she would break down.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u2018\u2018Separate? You didn\u2019t even look at me for the last five days, not once! That\u2019s enough of a separation. You didn\u2019t even sleep next to me. So we\u2019re not doing that. We\u2019re gonna be okay, do you hear me? We will talk. Tonight, we\u2019re gonna talk all night and we <i>will </i>be okay.\u2019\u2018 He was scared, because if they take a break, he knew that would be the first step to a break up, and he wasn\u2019t having any of that.\u00a0</p><p>\u2018\u2018We\u2019ve said enough, Harry. There is nothing more to be said.\u2019\u2018<br></p><p>\u2018\u2018Yes there is. There is so much I want to say to you and the most important bit is how much I love you.\u2019\u2018 Coming closer to her, Y/N kept taking steps back until she hit the wall. Harry was standing right in front of her, hovering over her body.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u2018\u2018Stop, please just move.\u2019\u2018<br></p><p>\u2018\u2018No, baby, I-I can\u2019t.\u2019\u2018 He leaned down his forehead against hers.\u00a0\u2018\u2018Please let us talk. I love you.\u2019\u2018 Harry whispered, but Y/N only sighed and closed her eyes.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u2018\u2018This isn\u2019t good for us, Harry.\u2019\u2018<br></p><p>\u2018\u2018But it\u2019s love, and it\u2019s supposed to hurt. That\u2019s what love is, love is pain.\u2019\u2018</p><p>\u2018\u2018No! It isn\u2019t! It\u2019s not supposed to hurt this much! This isn\u2019t love! This is pain, and there is so much of it that I cannot handle it!\u2019\u2018 She wanted to push him away, but she just had no strength.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u2018\u2018Then let\u2019s hurt tonight. Let\u2019s hurt together. Let\u2019s go to bed, lock the door and hit the lights. We\u2019re not gonna leave the room until we resolve our problem. They say love is pain, so let\u2019s hurt.\u2019\u2018<br></p><p>\u2018\u2018I don\u2019t want to, Harry, because I\u2019m already hurt enough and I don\u2019t want to hurt even more.\u2019\u2018 There was no sarcasm in her voice or anger, it was just sad and low.<br></p><p>\u2018\u2018Let\u2019s say all the things we couldn\u2019t before. If you want to yell, then yell, if you wanna cry, I will hold you and cry with you. Hell, if you want to punch something, I\u2019ll even let you punch me or just hold up a pillow for you. But please do not give up on us.\u2019\u2019 His hands found their way up to her hips, holding her closer; his body completely pressed against hers.\u00a0</p><p>\u2018\u2018I\u2019m tired Harry. So tired.\u2019\u2018 She trailed her hand up his chest, placing it just above his heart, feeling the speed it was beating at.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u2018\u2018And I\u2019m tired of sleeping alone, because I need you and I am not ready to lose you. I won\u2019t lose you.\u2019\u2018 He put his hand over her cheek, brushing the tears away.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u2018\u2018I threw the box away, and sold the jewellery and donated the money from it. The box is gone, okay? She never meant anything to me, it was just there. That box isn\u2019t important.\u2019\u2018 Harry added, reassuring her that he was hers, and he was always going to be hers.\u00a0\u2018\u2018My heart belongs to you. I\u2019d give my life for you, I\u2019d even give my life <i>to</i> you.\u2019\u2018<br></p><p>\u2018\u2018Let\u2019s go to bed.\u2019\u2018 Y/N spoke, for the first time in a while. She wiggled away from his grip, heading towards their bedroom but waiting for him to join her.\u00a0</p><p>They were sitting on their bed, backs pressed against the board, neither of them saying anything. But Harry was holding her hand, brushing his thumb over it lightly and placing kisses from time to time.\u00a0</p><p>\u2018\u2018Do you know why I asked for a place with four bedrooms and not only one or two?\u2019\u2018 Harry suddenly asked and Y/N just shook her head.\u00a0\u2018\u2019Because I want a family.\u2019\u2019 He looked over to her, meeting her eyes,\u00a0\u2018\u2019I want a family with you one day and I wish for it to be soon. Not right now or next month, but soon because that\u2019s all I want.\u2019\u2019\u00a0</p><p>\u2018\u2018You want a family with me?\u2019\u2018 Her eyes widened in surprise because this topic never came up before and she indeed was surprised.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u2018\u2018I wanna marry you, Y/N. Of course I\u2019d want a family too. My mum has been nagging too, surprised she didn\u2019t send you pictures of baby clothes to hint she wants a grandchild.\u2019\u2018<br></p><p>\u2018\u2018Oh.. I-I.. I didn\u2019t know that\u2026\u2019\u2018<br></p><p>\u2018\u2018That\u2019s because you found the wrong box. I know I hurt you a lot, and please forgive me for that. I was really stupid to say those things because I get it and I just cannot get over the fact how much I hurt you.\u2019\u2018 Turning to face her, he placed her in his lap and softly stroked her cheek with his thumb.\u00a0\u2018\u2018But you found the wrong box. I know you weren\u2019t <i>searching</i>, but I wish you found the other one. The more important one.\u2019\u2018<br></p><p>Y/N\u2019s mind was running wild, and her heart beating so fast. She felt like shaking because Harry just admitted to having a box\u2026with a ring in it. Her eyes were wide as she kept looking at Harry, trying to see if he was messing around or really serious.</p><p>\u2018\u2018I\u2019m not lying, I promise you.\u2019\u2018 He placed her down on the bed before going inside the closed to take the red velvet box and place it in front of her. He crossed his legs as he sat down.\u00a0\u2018\u2018Do you want to open it?\u2019\u2018 Harry carefully asked, scared out of his mind. Y/N carefully took the box in her hand and opened it. There was a silver ring with<i> love</i> written on it; it was similar to his <i>peace</i> one, but this one wasn\u2019t as wide and it was smaller.\u00a0</p><p>\u2018\u2018I\u2019m begging you, do not ever doubt my love for you again because you truly are the love of my life. I know I\u2019ve fucked up and maybe this isn\u2019t the best timing but please, just let me have you. Forever.\u2019\u2018 Harry took the box from her, placing it on the bed while he took her hand hovering with the ring over her finger.\u00a0\u2018\u2018Marry me, Y/N. Let me be the man you deserve, let me love you for the rest of my life. Let me be the best father to our children. Please, I will be all of those things, just please, will you marry me?\u2019\u2018 He was on the verge of crying but he contained himself. Hope in his eyes and his voice, as he waited for Y/N\u2019s answer.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u2018\u2018Yes, I will marry you. A hundred times, yes.\u2019\u2018 Harry\u2019s heart burst out of happiness when she answered the way he wanted her to.</p><p>\u2018\u2018I love you. I love you. I love you.\u2019\u2018 He leaned himself and hugged her tightly,\u00a0\u2018\u2018I love you so fucking much. Thank you.\u2019\u2019 Placing kisses all over her face, he couldn\u2019t calm himself down because of happy he was.\u00a0</p><p>\u2018\u2019I love you more.\u2019\u2019 Y/N replied through his hungry kisses.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0</p><p><i>Love was pain, and they did hurt, but that bit of pain was good because now they had each other and they were never gonna let go.\u00a0</i></p>",

They hadn\u2019t been living together for too long, but since every now and then one would have slept over at the others place, after two years of dating it was time to move in.\u00a0</i><i>That Sunday was their fourth Sunday together in their new place and with moving came a lot of boxes and quite the mess, but with each week it was less messy and more home-y.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>Harry would always be the one to clean the kitchen and the living room, while Y/N took care of the bedrooms and bathrooms, and well, Y/N hated doing the dishes so when Harry said that he would be taking care of them, it was a blessing.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>The last boxes Y/N unpacked were their clothes for the closet, but as she was first unpacking her clothes and putting them into its place, she noticed an unusual box </i>already<i> in the closet but in Harry\u2019s bit. \u2018\u2019Maybe it\u2019s his jewellery\u2019\u2019, she thought. It was probably out because Harry didn\u2019t want to go through ten boxes just to find some of his rings, so he put them into one box and places them on the top shelf, right?</i></p><p><i>Y/N reached for the box she had never seen before, and opened it. It was filled with some kind of pictures and letters, but turning the pictures around Y/N noticed they were rather personal and romantic pictures. The problem was, it wasn\u2019t Y/N on the pictures. Some of them had a date behind, there were two different necklaces and one ring, as well as handwritten notes which Y/N decided not to read.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>Her mind became a small mess, and her heart was on the verge of breaking. The box was still in her hand, shaking due to her hands shaking, as she got out of the room and headed towards the kitchen where Harry was.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u2018\u2018What is this?\u2019\u2018 Harry turned to face her as he heard his girlfriend speak in an unusual tone of voice.\u00a0<br></i></p><p><i>\u2018\u2018Oh that\u2019s just a box.\u2019\u2018 He said nonchalantly, drying his hands with a small towel.\u00a0<br></i></p><p><i>\u2018\u2018I don\u2019t think it\u2019s <b>just</b> a box\u2026\u2019\u2019 Y/N answered coyly,\u00a0\u2018\u2018It\u2019s rather\u2026 personalised.\u2019\u2019 Her voice was small and shy, not wanting to cause trouble but wanting to know about it because it did hurt her.</i></p><p><i>\u2018\u2019I\u2019m just like keeping them around, nothing special.\u2019\u2019 He shrugged his shoulders, turning around and continuing with the unboxing.\u00a0\u00a0<br></i></p><p><i>\u2018\u2018Harry.. It\u2019s not nothing. You have a box of..\u2019\u2018 Y/N was confused, and the more he answered with short replies the more it hurt her,\u00a0\u2018\u2018a box with memories of your ex-girlfriend.\u2019\u2018 She avoided saying that sentence because she actually didn\u2019t want to believe it was that.\u00a0<br></i></p><p><i>\u2018\u2018Bloody hell, yes it\u2019s a box. Yes there\u2019s pictures of me and my ex, but it\u2019s literally nothing. Stop making a big deal out of it.\u2019\u2018<br></i></p><p><i>\u2018\u2018I\u2019m not trying to..\u2019\u2018, despite him snapping at her, she continued to speak lowly and slowly,\u00a0\u2018\u2018It\u2019s \u2026 I never even knew you had this box and-\u2019\u2018<br></i></p><p><i>\u2018\u2018Because you don\u2019t need to know about it, or well, didn\u2019t, since you snooped and found it.\u2019\u2018 Harry waved his hands in frustration, not seeing the problem. So what, he kept the box, why wouldn\u2019t he? It\u2019s a part of my life - He thought to himself.\u00a0<br></i></p><p><i>\u2018\u2018Okay. I-I\u2019m sorry for bothering you. And snooping.\u2019\u2018 Y/N hung her had low in embarrassment, turning around and leaving the kitchen.\u00a0<br></i></p><p><i>She put the box in its place and went to the bathroom, locking herself in. Sliding down the door, tears stared to form in her eyes and slowly fall down her cheeks. Y/N was never insecure about their relationship, nor did she ever doubt Harry\u2019s love for her, but finding a box of memories and pictures of his ex-girlfriend was something else. It was the fact that that specific ex-girlfriend wasn\u2019t his last before he started dating Y/N, it was the one that completely broke his heart. It was the one that made Harry doubt each woman in his life, even Y/N. It was that she was the reason Y/N and Harry\u2019s relationship took a little longer than it would have if he hadn\u2019t had that rough break up with his ex.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>As Harry was cleaning and unpacking boxes, Y/N was in the bathroom breaking and crying, but he wasn\u2019t aware of that.\u00a0</i></p><p>Recalling the memory of what was the beginning of their biggest fight, Harry shook his head at how stupid he had acted. Of course it was a big deal. He kept a box of memories with a girl that broke his heart, the same girl that made him doubt Y/N\u2019s intentions and her, who had been the best thing to ever happen to him. Of course it wasn\u2019t just a box, it\u2019s a box filled with pictures of his ex, for fuck\u2019s sake.\u00a0</p><p>Harry buried his head into his hands, trying to stop himself from crying because he knew tonight was going to be rough. He quickly replied to Y/N\u2019s text before anxiously waiting for her reply.\u00a0</p><p><i>To Y/N: <b>Of course, baby. I love you.x</b></i></p><p>But there was no reply.</p><p><i>Since the beginning of their relationship, Y/N and Harry had this thing where at least one time a week, they would go to a cafe order two coffees and two muffins and just talk. And on those little dates, they talked about anything without picking an argument or being judged, not that either of them ever judged the other, but it was their time to be alone while in a crowd.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>Although this date was different. Ever since the box, things had been a bit off, at least to Y/N because it seemed like Harry didn\u2019t notice much. He didn\u2019t really notice how every night Y/N cried, nor how she didn\u2019t lean into him while sleeping like she always did. Maybe he had noticed, but Harry never said anything.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>But of course them waiting in a line couldn\u2019t go without a blast from the past. She just had to reappear in the weakest time of their relationship.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u2018\u2018Hey you!\u2019\u2018 A voice behind the said, in an excited tone, causing them to turn around.\u00a0\u2018\u2018How have you been?\u2019\u2018<br></i></p><p><i>\u2018\u2018T-Tori, hey! I\u2019m good, yeah, Yourself?\u2019\u2019 Harry replied, looking straight into his ex\u2019s eyes, with a small smile on his face, while Y/N stood frozen next to him wanting to leave every second.\u00a0</i><br></p><p><i>\u2018\u2018I\u2019m alright. I\u2019m back in London for a few days, so that\u2019s good yeah.\u2019\u2018<br></i></p><p><i>\u2018\u2018Oh that\u2019s great, how is your family? That\u2019s why you\u2019re back, right?\u2019\u2018\u00a0<br></i></p><p><i>\u2018\u2018Yeah yeah, they\u2019re good. They mention you from time to time actually. You should visit some time while I\u2019m still here.\u2019\u2018 It was obvious to Y/N that Tori was flirting with him, and yet Harry let her. She fluttered her eyes at him, sent him cheeky smiles, swayed while talking to him - it was obvious.\u00a0<br></i></p><p><i>\u2018\u2018Ah, I\u2019ll see. Maybe I do. I\u2019m a bit busy right now. But I will let you know.\u2019\u2018 He chuckled at her.<br></i></p><p><i>\u2018\u2018If I didn\u2019t know any better, I\u2019d say it\u2019s like still know each other.\u2019\u2018 Neither of them acknowledged Y/N, not Tori but also not Harry.\u00a0\u2018\u2019Still keeping the box?\u2019\u2019 Tori asked, hopefully.</i></p><p><i>\u2018\u2018Yeah, it\u2019s like we never faded, so I never really threw it out.\u2019\u2018 At this point, Y/N turned around leaving both of them alone. She could hear Harry calling after her, but she straight up ignored him and ran. Tears streamed down her face, blurring her vision, but not once did she stop running until she was in a small park far too away from Harry.\u00a0<br></i></p><p><i>Her phone kept ringing and blowing up with messages, but she ignored those too. She was sitting all alone on a bench, just looking up the sky being insecure about herself and their relationship, something that had never happened before.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>Being alone and sitting on that bench made her furious the more she kept thinking. Having an urge to hurt Harry the same way he had hurt her.\u00a0</i></p><p>Harry\u2019s thoughts were interrupted when someone walked into his office. His friend was standing by the door, holding some files in his hand and the doorknob with the other.\u00a0</p><p>\u2018\u2018You ready for the meeting?\u2019\u2018 His friend asked suspiciously, seeing the state of him.<br></p><p>\u2018\u2018Is there any way I could skip this one?\u2019\u2018 Harry\u2019s voice was a whisper, his head still in his hands.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u2018\u2018Are you, are you alright mate?\u2019\u2018 Jack closed the door behind him, taking a seat in front of Harry at his desk.<br></p><p>\u2018\u2018Y/N is gonna break up with me.\u2019\u2018 He looked up, meeting his friends concerned eyes that widened in surprise as he answered him.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u2018\u2018What? Why? I mean, why do you think that? Wait, <i>how</i> do you know that?\u2019\u2018<br></p><p>\u2018\u2018Because I\u2019m a stupid shit and I just fuck up. Because that\u2019s what I am, a fuck up.\u2019\u2018\u00a0<br></p><p>\u2018\u2018What did you do? If you don\u2019t mind me asking\u2026\u2019\u2018\u00a0<br></p><p>Harry\u00a0briefly explained the situation to his friend, not wanting to seem like he was complaining but still keeping it detailed.\u00a0</p><p><i>After many failed attempts of reaching her, calling and texting her even driving around certain spots he thought he was going to find her, Harry gave up and went back to their place. He still kept calling her every five minutes, just wanting to know she\u2019s safe, but Y/N had ignore each attempt.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>To Y/N: <b>Please tell me where you are.</b></i></p><p><i>To Y/N: <b>come home, please.</b>\u00a0</i></p><p><i>To Y/N: <b>please come home, i want us to talk</b></i></p><p><i>To Y/N: <b>i want us to be okay, please baby.</b>\u00a0</i></p><p><i>To Y/N: <b>i\u2019m so sorry</b></i></p><p><i>To Y/N: <b>i love you much, okay? you\u2019re the love of my life, please come back to me</b></i></p><p><i>To Y/N: <b>please</b></i></p><p><i>There was many more texts but not once did she reply. But sitting on their bed with the godforsaken box in his lap, he heard a ding on his phone, immediately reaching for it only to feel even more like shit and ever more broken.</i></p><p><i>From Y/N:<b> Stop texting me. You\u2019re annoying.\u00a0</b></i></p><p><i>Harry threw the box at the fall, watching it break into pieces just like his heart was. The pictures flew around and the metal jewellery hit the floor. He was sat on the floor with his back against the bed, with tears falling down his face the whole night before Y/N finally returned.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>When he heard the doors open, Harry immediately got up, running down the stairs to greet her, but he was in for a surprise because it was Y/N standing in front of the door, but it wasn\u2019t <b>his</b> Y/N. Because the Y/N standing in the living room had a stern look on her face, her eyes filled with anger and a brown box in her hands.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u2018\u2018Hello, Harry.\u2019\u2018 Her voice was reeking of sarcasm, accompanied with a very sarcastic and evil smile on her face.\u00a0<br></i></p><p><i>\u2018\u2018Hi baby..\u2019\u2018 Harry\u2019s voice was small, carefully coming closer to her, tiptoeing.\u00a0<br></i></p><p><i>\u2018\u2018How have you been? Because I had a fantastic day, I even went down a little memory lane, you know? And it was sooo good.\u2019\u2018 The smile never went away and her voice kept being more evil with each second.\u00a0\u2018\u2018Wanna see?\u2019\u2018 She quickly added, pushing the box in front of her, nodding at it.\u00a0<br></i></p><p><i>\u2018\u2018I\u2019m-I, um, I\u2019m not sure what to say right now\u2026\u2019\u2018<br></i></p><p><i>\u2018\u2018Oh! Don\u2019t you worry! Here let\u2019s sit, yeah?\u2019\u2018 Y/N sat down on the couch, opening the box quickly and taking out some pictures and setting them on the table.\u00a0\u2018\u2018Oh my, I remember this day like it was yesterday! Sit and listen, yeah? So this day we actually went on a our first date and it was the day of our first kiss too, you know? So David said maybe we should take a picture to remember it, right? But as I was snapping the picture he kissed me, so it\u2019s a picture of us kissing.\u2019\u2018 Y/N explained, pushing the picture down the table of her and her ex-boyfriend kissing, while taking another out.\u00a0<br></i></p><p><i>\u2018\u2018Oh this one is a bit.. exposing but hey! It was one morning after we woke up, obviously I was half naked, and it was the morning selfie, you know? But that was a nice day, because I met his family then and we had lots of s-\u2019\u2018<br></i></p><p><i>\u2018\u2018Stop! Stop talking!\u2019\u2018 Harry snapped, not wanting to listen to her stories about her ex-boyfriend.\u00a0\u2018\u2019I get it, okay?! I fucking get it.\u2019\u2019 Once again, tears streamed down his face.</i></p><p><i>\u2018\u2018What\u2019s wrong, Harry? I mean, it\u2019s just a box.\u2019\u2018<br></i></p><p><i>\u2018\u2018No, no it\u2019s not just a fucking box. You <b>know</b> I hate him, you know I <b>hate </b>your stupid ex-boyfriend. You. Know.\u2019\u2018 The wasn\u2019t as much anger in his voice as there was pain.\u00a0\u2018\u2018And where the hell did you even get these pictures? Didn\u2019t you delete them all? Why do you still have them?\u2019\u2018</i></p><p><i>\u2018\u2018Isn\u2019t that a bit hypocritical, you know, coming from you?\u2019\u2018\u00a0<br></i></p><p><i>\u2018\u2018No it\u2019s not. And do not ignore my question.\u2019\u2018<br></i></p><p><i>\u2018\u2018But it is. Because you have the same box, you <b>kept</b> the box, so why can\u2019t I have one of my own? I mean, why would you make a big deal out of it?\u2019\u2018<br></i></p><p><i>\u2018\u2018I get it, okay? You\u2019re getting your way back at me. I was wrong and you were right. Can we stop this nonsense now?\u2019\u2018 He rubbed his eyes, feeling even shittier than before. His voice was low and he wasn\u2019t snapping at her anymore.\u00a0<br></i></p><p><i>\u2018\u2018Sure, I\u2019mma go to bed now, go through some more memories. You do what you wanna do.\u2019\u2018 Packing the pictures into the box, Y/N stood up heading towards the stairs to go to the guest bedroom, because there was no chance she was going to sleep next to him tonight. But Harry had other plans; he snatched the box from her hands and threw it away, making Y/N jump in surprise.\u00a0<br></i></p><p><i>\u2018\u2018You\u2019re not taking the box with you. We\u2019re gonna throw it out tomorrow, Hell, I\u2019m gonna throw it out now.\u2019\u2018<br></i></p><p><i>\u2018\u2018No you\u2019re not.\u2019\u2019 Even though Y/N wasn\u2019t always the stubborn one, she wouldn\u2019t let this one slide. She crouched down, picking the stuff and putting it into its place.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u2018\u2018Yes I am, stop picking that shit up.\u2019\u2018 He crouched down next to her, taking the stuff away from her, ready to throw it once again.\u00a0<br></i></p><p><i>\u2018\u2018No, you don\u2019t get it. You\u2019re not gonna throw it out. I don\u2019t care that you hate my ex. Who knows? Maybe he comes back to me one day, so I won\u2019t have to print them out again, maybe it will be like <b>we never faded</b>.\u2019\u2018\u00a0<br></i></p><p><i>\u2018\u2018Stop. Stop. Stop.\u2019\u2018 He kept rubbing his tears away, his heart breaking with each tear,\u00a0\u2018\u2018Just stop, please?\u2019\u2018 He begged her,\u00a0\u2018\u2018you\u2019re hurting me, please, stop.\u2019\u2018\u00a0<br></i></p><p><i>\u2018\u2018What about me? What about the fact that you\u2019ve hurt me, hm?\u2019\u2018 Y/N asked him, crossing her arms in front of her.<br></i></p><p><i>\u2018\u2018I\u2019m sorry, okay? I will throw the box away, and I\u2019ll donate the jewellery. Just please stop, I\u2019m sorry.\u2019\u2018\u00a0<br></i></p><p><i>\u2018\u2018You\u2019re sorry?\u2019\u2018 A sarcastic chuckle escaped her lips, making Harry look up and meet her gaze, her sad but angry gaze.\u00a0\u2018\u2019You\u2019re sorry. Great, everything is perfect again. Yay. Go us.\u2019\u2019 She put her hand up, mocking the victory fist.\u00a0\u2018\u2019You\u2019re unbelievable, you know?\u2019\u2019 It was the last thing she said before she went to the guest bedroom and locked herself in. She left the box in the living room because all she wanted to do was cry and just call herself stupid. Doubt herself, doubt everything, break from inside out.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>Harry didn\u2019t follow after her, instead he took the box going over the pictures because he couldn\u2019t help himself. With each picture, he hated her ex even more. It made him furious and sad at the same time, because that <b>wasn\u2019t him</b>. He knew that back then, they didn\u2019t even know each other but the fact that there was a time where she wasn\u2019t his hurt him, because now she was the love of his life. He couldn\u2019t imagine a life without her, but he had fucked up. He had realised how stupid he had been, how she must have felt when she found that stupid box of his.\u00a0</i></p><p>\u2018\u2018I don\u2019t think she is going to break up with you, but I think she is just really mad at you, because don\u2019t get me wrong but you did fuck up.\u2019\u2018 Harry\u2019s friend, Jack said.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u2018\u2018You don\u2019t get it. That was four days ago and she left. Like she\u2019s perhaps staying in the same place as I am, but it\u2019s like she isn\u2019t there. Not once did she text me or call me, she doesn\u2019t sleep in the same bed as me. She just\u2026 left me, maybe not physically, but mentally. It\u2019s like she just gave up on me, you know.. which I get because I deserve it\u2026\u2019\u2018 Harry was ranting to his best friend, because he didn\u2019t speak to anyone about the whole fight, not even his mum.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u2018\u2018Wait, so if she\u2019s so mad at you, how come you were supposed to go out on a date tonight? Before she cancelled, of course.\u2019\u2018<br></p><p>\u2018\u2018I don\u2019t know..\u2019\u2018 He brushed his hand through his hair,\u00a0\u2018\u2018I do, it\u2019s just\u2026 I asked her friend if she could ask Y/N for a double date, you know? But of course, it wasn\u2019t going to be a double date, because they weren\u2019t going to show up, and it was gonna be just Y/N and I.\u2019\u2018\u00a0<br></p><p>\u2018\u2018Don\u2019t you think that she kinda caught onto that? Because I\u2019m pretty sure Y/N isn\u2019t as stupid.\u2019\u2018<br></p><p>\u2018\u2018She probably did, that\u2019s why she probably asked me to cancel.\u2019\u2018\u00a0<br></p><p>\u2018\u2018Go home, right now.\u2019\u2018 Jack insisted,\u00a0\u2018\u2018Leave, fuck the meeting. Go buy her flowers and go apologise because you were a right dick.\u2019\u2019</p><p>Harry just nodded his head and did exactly that. He bought her a big bouquet of flowers and some chocolate and drove home. The silence as he drove was killing him and he was so anxious and nervous.\u00a0</p><p>When he got home, he was worn to the bones. He locked the door and headed towards the living room, but he was her sitting down in front of the counter looking at him.\u00a0</p><p>\u2018\u2018Hey.\u2019\u2018 Harry said, coming closer to her and putting the flowers and the chocolate in front of her,\u00a0\u2018\u2018These are for you.\u2019\u2018 He smiled softly at her, trying to ease the tension.\u00a0</p><p>\u2018\u2018I wasn\u2019t aware you were gonna be back earlier.\u2019\u2018 Y/N replied, not acknowledging the flowers.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u2018\u2018I-I, yeah, I just didn\u2019t have much to do, so I came home.\u2019\u2018 Y/N winced at the word home, because was it? Was this <i>a home</i>?<br></p><p>\u2018\u2018I hate when you\u2019re lying.\u2019\u2018 She looked straight into his eyes because she knew he had quite the important meeting today.\u00a0</p><p>\u2018\u2018I, um.. sorry.. I just wanted to come home\u2026\u2019\u2018 He hung his head low, feeling the heat of his cheeks,\u00a0\u2018\u2018come home to you.\u2019\u2018 He whispered.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u2018\u2018Do you think, the fact that it took us this long to move in together is actually a sign that maybe we never should have?\u2019\u2018 Y/N asked, looking down at her lap fidgeting with her hands.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u2018\u2018What? No, no, no. No! That was not a sign.\u2019\u2018 He waved his hands and shook his head at her,\u00a0\u2018\u2018No, it was just we were always so busy to have some proper time to actually move. We\u2019ve spent so much time at each others places, it\u2019s just we never had time to pack and move to our own place.\u2019\u2018 His heart was beating at an unusual speed, fearing her next words.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u2018\u2018I think it was.\u2019\u2018<br></p><p>\u2018\u2018No, Y/N stop.\u2019\u2018 Harry came closer, putting his hands on her hips only to be pushed away.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u2018\u2018Please don\u2019t touch me.\u2019\u2018 Y/N moved away from him, hugging herself tightly.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u2018\u2018Baby..\u2019\u2018 he was hurt, his heart hurt,\u00a0\u2018\u2018Please. Do not think that, please.\u2019\u2018<br></p><p>\u2018\u2018You know, I never doubted you, or our love, or anything really.\u2019\u2018 She looked out of the window before adding,\u00a0\u2018\u2018But in the past week or two, I\u2019ve doubted everything.\u2019\u2018<br></p><p>\u2018\u2018You shouldn\u2019t, because I love you. More than anything in this world. You can call mum if you want to, because she is gonna tell you that I <i>never shut up</i> about you. You\u2019re the love of my life, okay? And that\u2026 the past week has been a lot but it was a simple mistake, not something that should break us apart.\u2019\u2019\u00a0<br></p><p>\u2018\u2018A simple mistake?\u2019\u2018 She narrowed her eyes, looking at him,\u00a0\u2018\u2018if a <i>simple </i>mistake like that could make me doubt everything, from myself to you, your love and to our relationship. Then I don\u2019t want to know what a big mistake could do to us.\u2019\u2018<br></p><p>\u2018\u2018I-I didn\u2019t mean it like that, I\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s just, please do no doubt me, okay? You <i>know</i> I love you more than anything. You should know that, because there isn\u2019t anyone I love as much as you.\u2019\u2018 He took a step towards her, but still keeping the distance because he was afraid of her stepping back.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u2018\u2018Maybe we should take a small break from each other.\u2019\u2018 She stated, no emotions on her face.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u2018\u2018No! I\u2019m not- we\u2019re not breaking up. No!\u2019\u2018\u00a0<br></p><p>\u2018\u2018I didn\u2019t say a break up, but we should separate from each other for\u2026 a little while.\u2019\u2018 Y/N couldn\u2019t dare to look at him, because if she did, she would break down.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u2018\u2018Separate? You didn\u2019t even look at me for the last five days, not once! That\u2019s enough of a separation. You didn\u2019t even sleep next to me. So we\u2019re not doing that. We\u2019re gonna be okay, do you hear me? We will talk. Tonight, we\u2019re gonna talk all night and we <i>will </i>be okay.\u2019\u2018 He was scared, because if they take a break, he knew that would be the first step to a break up, and he wasn\u2019t having any of that.\u00a0</p><p>\u2018\u2018We\u2019ve said enough, Harry. There is nothing more to be said.\u2019\u2018<br></p><p>\u2018\u2018Yes there is. There is so much I want to say to you and the most important bit is how much I love you.\u2019\u2018 Coming closer to her, Y/N kept taking steps back until she hit the wall. Harry was standing right in front of her, hovering over her body.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u2018\u2018Stop, please just move.\u2019\u2018<br></p><p>\u2018\u2018No, baby, I-I can\u2019t.\u2019\u2018 He leaned down his forehead against hers.\u00a0\u2018\u2018Please let us talk. I love you.\u2019\u2018 Harry whispered, but Y/N only sighed and closed her eyes.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u2018\u2018This isn\u2019t good for us, Harry.\u2019\u2018<br></p><p>\u2018\u2018But it\u2019s love, and it\u2019s supposed to hurt. That\u2019s what love is, love is pain.\u2019\u2018</p><p>\u2018\u2018No! It isn\u2019t! It\u2019s not supposed to hurt this much! This isn\u2019t love! This is pain, and there is so much of it that I cannot handle it!\u2019\u2018 She wanted to push him away, but she just had no strength.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u2018\u2018Then let\u2019s hurt tonight. Let\u2019s hurt together. Let\u2019s go to bed, lock the door and hit the lights. We\u2019re not gonna leave the room until we resolve our problem. They say love is pain, so let\u2019s hurt.\u2019\u2018<br></p><p>\u2018\u2018I don\u2019t want to, Harry, because I\u2019m already hurt enough and I don\u2019t want to hurt even more.\u2019\u2018 There was no sarcasm in her voice or anger, it was just sad and low.<br></p><p>\u2018\u2018Let\u2019s say all the things we couldn\u2019t before. If you want to yell, then yell, if you wanna cry, I will hold you and cry with you. Hell, if you want to punch something, I\u2019ll even let you punch me or just hold up a pillow for you. But please do not give up on us.\u2019\u2019 His hands found their way up to her hips, holding her closer; his body completely pressed against hers.\u00a0</p><p>\u2018\u2018I\u2019m tired Harry. So tired.\u2019\u2018 She trailed her hand up his chest, placing it just above his heart, feeling the speed it was beating at.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u2018\u2018And I\u2019m tired of sleeping alone, because I need you and I am not ready to lose you. I won\u2019t lose you.\u2019\u2018 He put his hand over her cheek, brushing the tears away.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u2018\u2018I threw the box away, and sold the jewellery and donated the money from it. The box is gone, okay? She never meant anything to me, it was just there. That box isn\u2019t important.\u2019\u2018 Harry added, reassuring her that he was hers, and he was always going to be hers.\u00a0\u2018\u2018My heart belongs to you. I\u2019d give my life for you, I\u2019d even give my life <i>to</i> you.\u2019\u2018<br></p><p>\u2018\u2018Let\u2019s go to bed.\u2019\u2018 Y/N spoke, for the first time in a while. She wiggled away from his grip, heading towards their bedroom but waiting for him to join her.\u00a0</p><p>They were sitting on their bed, backs pressed against the board, neither of them saying anything. But Harry was holding her hand, brushing his thumb over it lightly and placing kisses from time to time.\u00a0</p><p>\u2018\u2018Do you know why I asked for a place with four bedrooms and not only one or two?\u2019\u2018 Harry suddenly asked and Y/N just shook her head.\u00a0\u2018\u2019Because I want a family.\u2019\u2019 He looked over to her, meeting her eyes,\u00a0\u2018\u2019I want a family with you one day and I wish for it to be soon. Not right now or next month, but soon because that\u2019s all I want.\u2019\u2019\u00a0</p><p>\u2018\u2018You want a family with me?\u2019\u2018 Her eyes widened in surprise because this topic never came up before and she indeed was surprised.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u2018\u2018I wanna marry you, Y/N. Of course I\u2019d want a family too. My mum has been nagging too, surprised she didn\u2019t send you pictures of baby clothes to hint she wants a grandchild.\u2019\u2018<br></p><p>\u2018\u2018Oh.. I-I.. I didn\u2019t know that\u2026\u2019\u2018<br></p><p>\u2018\u2018That\u2019s because you found the wrong box. I know I hurt you a lot, and please forgive me for that. I was really stupid to say those things because I get it and I just cannot get over the fact how much I hurt you.\u2019\u2018 Turning to face her, he placed her in his lap and softly stroked her cheek with his thumb.\u00a0\u2018\u2018But you found the wrong box. I know you weren\u2019t <i>searching</i>, but I wish you found the other one. The more important one.\u2019\u2018<br></p><p>Y/N\u2019s mind was running wild, and her heart beating so fast. She felt like shaking because Harry just admitted to having a box\u2026with a ring in it. Her eyes were wide as she kept looking at Harry, trying to see if he was messing around or really serious.</p><p>\u2018\u2018I\u2019m not lying, I promise you.\u2019\u2018 He placed her down on the bed before going inside the closed to take the red velvet box and place it in front of her. He crossed his legs as he sat down.\u00a0\u2018\u2018Do you want to open it?\u2019\u2018 Harry carefully asked, scared out of his mind. Y/N carefully took the box in her hand and opened it. There was a silver ring with<i> love</i> written on it; it was similar to his <i>peace</i> one, but this one wasn\u2019t as wide and it was smaller.\u00a0</p><p>\u2018\u2018I\u2019m begging you, do not ever doubt my love for you again because you truly are the love of my life. I know I\u2019ve fucked up and maybe this isn\u2019t the best timing but please, just let me have you. Forever.\u2019\u2018 Harry took the box from her, placing it on the bed while he took her hand hovering with the ring over her finger.\u00a0\u2018\u2018Marry me, Y/N. Let me be the man you deserve, let me love you for the rest of my life. Let me be the best father to our children. Please, I will be all of those things, just please, will you marry me?\u2019\u2018 He was on the verge of crying but he contained himself. Hope in his eyes and his voice, as he waited for Y/N\u2019s answer.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u2018\u2018Yes, I will marry you. A hundred times, yes.\u2019\u2018 Harry\u2019s heart burst out of happiness when she answered the way he wanted her to.</p><p>\u2018\u2018I love you. I love you. I love you.\u2019\u2018 He leaned himself and hugged her tightly,\u00a0\u2018\u2018I love you so fucking much. Thank you.\u2019\u2019 Placing kisses all over her face, he couldn\u2019t calm himself down because of happy he was.\u00a0</p><p>\u2018\u2019I love you more.\u2019\u2019 Y/N replied through his hungry kisses.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0</p><p><i>Love was pain, and they did hurt, but that bit of pain was good because now they had each other and they were never gonna let go.\u00a0</i></p>",

There&rsquo;s something we need to talk about later on.</i></b></p><p>Harry felt a thug at his heart as he skimmed over the text his girlfriend had sent him. Perhaps he was wrong, perhaps he made a mistake and he <i>was</i> going to apologise; but <i>&ldquo;This could get rough&rdquo;</i> Harry thought to himself.</p><p>There was two more hours before he could go home, but ever since he had received the text, Harry dreaded each passing minute. Thoughts started overflowing his brain; he was thinking of ways to apologise, because maybe he <i>was</i> wrong but at the time, Harry wasn&rsquo;t quite aware of it.&nbsp;</p><p><i>It was a Sunday, or rather cleaning-day in Y/N&rsquo;s and Harry&rsquo;s household. They hadn&rsquo;t been living together for too long, but since every now and then one would have slept over at the others place, after two years of dating it was time to move in.&nbsp;</i><i>That Sunday was their fourth Sunday together in their new place and with moving came a lot of boxes and quite the mess, but with each week it was less messy and more home-y.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>Harry would always be the one to clean the kitchen and the living room, while Y/N took care of the bedrooms and bathrooms, and well, Y/N hated doing the dishes so when Harry said that he would be taking care of them, it was a blessing.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>The last boxes Y/N unpacked were their clothes for the closet, but as she was first unpacking her clothes and putting them into its place, she noticed an unusual box </i>already<i> in the closet but in Harry&rsquo;s bit. &lsquo;&rsquo;Maybe it&rsquo;s his jewellery&rsquo;&rsquo;, she thought. It was probably out because Harry didn&rsquo;t want to go through ten boxes just to find some of his rings, so he put them into one box and places them on the top shelf, right?</i></p><p><i>Y/N reached for the box she had never seen before, and opened it. It was filled with some kind of pictures and letters, but turning the pictures around Y/N noticed they were rather personal and romantic pictures. The problem was, it wasn&rsquo;t Y/N on the pictures. Some of them had a date behind, there were two different necklaces and one ring, as well as handwritten notes which Y/N decided not to read.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>Her mind became a small mess, and her heart was on the verge of breaking. The box was still in her hand, shaking due to her hands shaking, as she got out of the room and headed towards the kitchen where Harry was.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>&lsquo;&lsquo;What is this?&rsquo;&lsquo; Harry turned to face her as he heard his girlfriend speak in an unusual tone of voice.&nbsp;<br /></i></p><p><i>&lsquo;&lsquo;Oh that&rsquo;s just a box.&rsquo;&lsquo; He said nonchalantly, drying his hands with a small towel.&nbsp;<br /></i></p><p><i>&lsquo;&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s <b>just</b> a box&hellip;&rsquo;&rsquo; Y/N answered coyly,&nbsp;&lsquo;&lsquo;It&rsquo;s rather&hellip; personalised.&rsquo;&rsquo; Her voice was small and shy, not wanting to cause trouble but wanting to know about it because it did hurt her.</i></p><p><i>&lsquo;&rsquo;I&rsquo;m just like keeping them around, nothing special.&rsquo;&rsquo; He shrugged his shoulders, turning around and continuing with the unboxing.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></i></p><p><i>&lsquo;&lsquo;Harry.. It&rsquo;s not nothing. You have a box of..&rsquo;&lsquo; Y/N was confused, and the more he answered with short replies the more it hurt her,&nbsp;&lsquo;&lsquo;a box with memories of your ex-girlfriend.&rsquo;&lsquo; She avoided saying that sentence because she actually didn&rsquo;t want to believe it was that.&nbsp;<br /></i></p><p><i>&lsquo;&lsquo;Bloody hell, yes it&rsquo;s a box. Yes there&rsquo;s pictures of me and my ex, but it&rsquo;s literally nothing. Stop making a big deal out of it.&rsquo;&lsquo;<br /></i></p><p><i>&lsquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;m not trying to..&rsquo;&lsquo;, despite him snapping at her, she continued to speak lowly and slowly,&nbsp;&lsquo;&lsquo;It&rsquo;s &hellip; I never even knew you had this box and-&rsquo;&lsquo;<br /></i></p><p><i>&lsquo;&lsquo;Because you don&rsquo;t need to know about it, or well, didn&rsquo;t, since you snooped and found it.&rsquo;&lsquo; Harry waved his hands in frustration, not seeing the problem. So what, he kept the box, why wouldn&rsquo;t he? It&rsquo;s a part of my life - He thought to himself.&nbsp;<br /></i></p><p><i>&lsquo;&lsquo;Okay. I-I&rsquo;m sorry for bothering you. And snooping.&rsquo;&lsquo; Y/N hung her had low in embarrassment, turning around and leaving the kitchen.&nbsp;<br /></i></p><p><i>She put the box in its place and went to the bathroom, locking herself in. Sliding down the door, tears stared to form in her eyes and slowly fall down her cheeks. Y/N was never insecure about their relationship, nor did she ever doubt Harry&rsquo;s love for her, but finding a box of memories and pictures of his ex-girlfriend was something else. It was the fact that that specific ex-girlfriend wasn&rsquo;t his last before he started dating Y/N, it was the one that completely broke his heart. It was the one that made Harry doubt each woman in his life, even Y/N. It was that she was the reason Y/N and Harry&rsquo;s relationship took a little longer than it would have if he hadn&rsquo;t had that rough break up with his ex.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>As Harry was cleaning and unpacking boxes, Y/N was in the bathroom breaking and crying, but he wasn&rsquo;t aware of that.&nbsp;</i></p><p>Recalling the memory of what was the beginning of their biggest fight, Harry shook his head at how stupid he had acted. Of course it was a big deal. He kept a box of memories with a girl that broke his heart, the same girl that made him doubt Y/N&rsquo;s intentions and her, who had been the best thing to ever happen to him. Of course it wasn&rsquo;t just a box, it&rsquo;s a box filled with pictures of his ex, for fuck&rsquo;s sake.&nbsp;</p><p>Harry buried his head into his hands, trying to stop himself from crying because he knew tonight was going to be rough. He quickly replied to Y/N&rsquo;s text before anxiously waiting for her reply.&nbsp;</p><p><i>To Y/N: <b>Of course, baby. I love you.x</b></i></p><p>But there was no reply.</p><p><i>Since the beginning of their relationship, Y/N and Harry had this thing where at least one time a week, they would go to a cafe order two coffees and two muffins and just talk. And on those little dates, they talked about anything without picking an argument or being judged, not that either of them ever judged the other, but it was their time to be alone while in a crowd.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>Although this date was different. Ever since the box, things had been a bit off, at least to Y/N because it seemed like Harry didn&rsquo;t notice much. He didn&rsquo;t really notice how every night Y/N cried, nor how she didn&rsquo;t lean into him while sleeping like she always did. Maybe he had noticed, but Harry never said anything.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>But of course them waiting in a line couldn&rsquo;t go without a blast from the past. She just had to reappear in the weakest time of their relationship.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>&lsquo;&lsquo;Hey you!&rsquo;&lsquo; A voice behind the said, in an excited tone, causing them to turn around.&nbsp;&lsquo;&lsquo;How have you been?&rsquo;&lsquo;<br /></i></p><p><i>&lsquo;&lsquo;T-Tori, hey! I&rsquo;m good, yeah, Yourself?&rsquo;&rsquo; Harry replied, looking straight into his ex&rsquo;s eyes, with a small smile on his face, while Y/N stood frozen next to him wanting to leave every second.&nbsp;</i><br /></p><p><i>&lsquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;m alright. I&rsquo;m back in London for a few days, so that&rsquo;s good yeah.&rsquo;&lsquo;<br /></i></p><p><i>&lsquo;&lsquo;Oh that&rsquo;s great, how is your family? That&rsquo;s why you&rsquo;re back, right?&rsquo;&lsquo;&nbsp;<br /></i></p><p><i>&lsquo;&lsquo;Yeah yeah, they&rsquo;re good. They mention you from time to time actually. You should visit some time while I&rsquo;m still here.&rsquo;&lsquo; It was obvious to Y/N that Tori was flirting with him, and yet Harry let her. She fluttered her eyes at him, sent him cheeky smiles, swayed while talking to him - it was obvious.&nbsp;<br /></i></p><p><i>&lsquo;&lsquo;Ah, I&rsquo;ll see. Maybe I do. I&rsquo;m a bit busy right now. But I will let you know.&rsquo;&lsquo; He chuckled at her.<br /></i></p><p><i>&lsquo;&lsquo;If I didn&rsquo;t know any better, I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s like still know each other.&rsquo;&lsquo; Neither of them acknowledged Y/N, not Tori but also not Harry.&nbsp;&lsquo;&rsquo;Still keeping the box?&rsquo;&rsquo; Tori asked, hopefully.</i></p><p><i>&lsquo;&lsquo;Yeah, it&rsquo;s like we never faded, so I never really threw it out.&rsquo;&lsquo; At this point, Y/N turned around leaving both of them alone. She could hear Harry calling after her, but she straight up ignored him and ran. Tears streamed down her face, blurring her vision, but not once did she stop running until she was in a small park far too away from Harry.&nbsp;<br /></i></p><p><i>Her phone kept ringing and blowing up with messages, but she ignored those too. She was sitting all alone on a bench, just looking up the sky being insecure about herself and their relationship, something that had never happened before.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>Being alone and sitting on that bench made her furious the more she kept thinking. Having an urge to hurt Harry the same way he had hurt her.&nbsp;</i></p><p>Harry&rsquo;s thoughts were interrupted when someone walked into his office. His friend was standing by the door, holding some files in his hand and the doorknob with the other.&nbsp;</p><p>&lsquo;&lsquo;You ready for the meeting?&rsquo;&lsquo; His friend asked suspiciously, seeing the state of him.<br /></p><p>&lsquo;&lsquo;Is there any way I could skip this one?&rsquo;&lsquo; Harry&rsquo;s voice was a whisper, his head still in his hands.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&lsquo;&lsquo;Are you, are you alright mate?&rsquo;&lsquo; Jack closed the door behind him, taking a seat in front of Harry at his desk.<br /></p><p>&lsquo;&lsquo;Y/N is gonna break up with me.&rsquo;&lsquo; He looked up, meeting his friends concerned eyes that widened in surprise as he answered him.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&lsquo;&lsquo;What? Why? I mean, why do you think that? Wait, <i>how</i> do you know that?&rsquo;&lsquo;<br /></p><p>&lsquo;&lsquo;Because I&rsquo;m a stupid shit and I just fuck up. Because that&rsquo;s what I am, a fuck up.&rsquo;&lsquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&lsquo;&lsquo;What did you do? If you don&rsquo;t mind me asking&hellip;&rsquo;&lsquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Harry&nbsp;briefly explained the situation to his friend, not wanting to seem like he was complaining but still keeping it detailed.&nbsp;</p><p><i>After many failed attempts of reaching her, calling and texting her even driving around certain spots he thought he was going to find her, Harry gave up and went back to their place. He still kept calling her every five minutes, just wanting to know she&rsquo;s safe, but Y/N had ignore each attempt.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>To Y/N: <b>Please tell me where you are.</b></i></p><p><i>To Y/N: <b>come home, please.</b>&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>To Y/N: <b>please come home, i want us to talk</b></i></p><p><i>To Y/N: <b>i want us to be okay, please baby.</b>&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>To Y/N: <b>i&rsquo;m so sorry</b></i></p><p><i>To Y/N: <b>i love you much, okay? you&rsquo;re the love of my life, please come back to me</b></i></p><p><i>To Y/N: <b>please</b></i></p><p><i>There was many more texts but not once did she reply. But sitting on their bed with the godforsaken box in his lap, he heard a ding on his phone, immediately reaching for it only to feel even more like shit and ever more broken.</i></p><p><i>From Y/N:<b> Stop texting me. You&rsquo;re annoying.&nbsp;</b></i></p><p><i>Harry threw the box at the fall, watching it break into pieces just like his heart was. The pictures flew around and the metal jewellery hit the floor. He was sat on the floor with his back against the bed, with tears falling down his face the whole night before Y/N finally returned.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>When he heard the doors open, Harry immediately got up, running down the stairs to greet her, but he was in for a surprise because it was Y/N standing in front of the door, but it wasn&rsquo;t <b>his</b> Y/N. Because the Y/N standing in the living room had a stern look on her face, her eyes filled with anger and a brown box in her hands.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>&lsquo;&lsquo;Hello, Harry.&rsquo;&lsquo; Her voice was reeking of sarcasm, accompanied with a very sarcastic and evil smile on her face.&nbsp;<br /></i></p><p><i>&lsquo;&lsquo;Hi baby..&rsquo;&lsquo; Harry&rsquo;s voice was small, carefully coming closer to her, tiptoeing.&nbsp;<br /></i></p><p><i>&lsquo;&lsquo;How have you been? Because I had a fantastic day, I even went down a little memory lane, you know? And it was sooo good.&rsquo;&lsquo; The smile never went away and her voice kept being more evil with each second.&nbsp;&lsquo;&lsquo;Wanna see?&rsquo;&lsquo; She quickly added, pushing the box in front of her, nodding at it.&nbsp;<br /></i></p><p><i>&lsquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;m-I, um, I&rsquo;m not sure what to say right now&hellip;&rsquo;&lsquo;<br /></i></p><p><i>&lsquo;&lsquo;Oh! Don&rsquo;t you worry! Here let&rsquo;s sit, yeah?&rsquo;&lsquo; Y/N sat down on the couch, opening the box quickly and taking out some pictures and setting them on the table.&nbsp;&lsquo;&lsquo;Oh my, I remember this day like it was yesterday! Sit and listen, yeah? So this day we actually went on a our first date and it was the day of our first kiss too, you know? So David said maybe we should take a picture to remember it, right? But as I was snapping the picture he kissed me, so it&rsquo;s a picture of us kissing.&rsquo;&lsquo; Y/N explained, pushing the picture down the table of her and her ex-boyfriend kissing, while taking another out.&nbsp;<br /></i></p><p><i>&lsquo;&lsquo;Oh this one is a bit.. exposing but hey! It was one morning after we woke up, obviously I was half naked, and it was the morning selfie, you know? But that was a nice day, because I met his family then and we had lots of s-&rsquo;&lsquo;<br /></i></p><p><i>&lsquo;&lsquo;Stop! Stop talking!&rsquo;&lsquo; Harry snapped, not wanting to listen to her stories about her ex-boyfriend.&nbsp;&lsquo;&rsquo;I get it, okay?! I fucking get it.&rsquo;&rsquo; Once again, tears streamed down his face.</i></p><p><i>&lsquo;&lsquo;What&rsquo;s wrong, Harry? I mean, it&rsquo;s just a box.&rsquo;&lsquo;<br /></i></p><p><i>&lsquo;&lsquo;No, no it&rsquo;s not just a fucking box. You <b>know</b> I hate him, you know I <b>hate </b>your stupid ex-boyfriend. You. Know.&rsquo;&lsquo; The wasn&rsquo;t as much anger in his voice as there was pain.&nbsp;&lsquo;&lsquo;And where the hell did you even get these pictures? Didn&rsquo;t you delete them all? Why do you still have them?&rsquo;&lsquo;</i></p><p><i>&lsquo;&lsquo;Isn&rsquo;t that a bit hypocritical, you know, coming from you?&rsquo;&lsquo;&nbsp;<br /></i></p><p><i>&lsquo;&lsquo;No it&rsquo;s not. And do not ignore my question.&rsquo;&lsquo;<br /></i></p><p><i>&lsquo;&lsquo;But it is. Because you have the same box, you <b>kept</b> the box, so why can&rsquo;t I have one of my own? I mean, why would you make a big deal out of it?&rsquo;&lsquo;<br /></i></p><p><i>&lsquo;&lsquo;I get it, okay? You&rsquo;re getting your way back at me. I was wrong and you were right. Can we stop this nonsense now?&rsquo;&lsquo; He rubbed his eyes, feeling even shittier than before. His voice was low and he wasn&rsquo;t snapping at her anymore.&nbsp;<br /></i></p><p><i>&lsquo;&lsquo;Sure, I&rsquo;mma go to bed now, go through some more memories. You do what you wanna do.&rsquo;&lsquo; Packing the pictures into the box, Y/N stood up heading towards the stairs to go to the guest bedroom, because there was no chance she was going to sleep next to him tonight. But Harry had other plans; he snatched the box from her hands and threw it away, making Y/N jump in surprise.&nbsp;<br /></i></p><p><i>&lsquo;&lsquo;You&rsquo;re not taking the box with you. We&rsquo;re gonna throw it out tomorrow, Hell, I&rsquo;m gonna throw it out now.&rsquo;&lsquo;<br /></i></p><p><i>&lsquo;&lsquo;No you&rsquo;re not.&rsquo;&rsquo; Even though Y/N wasn&rsquo;t always the stubborn one, she wouldn&rsquo;t let this one slide. She crouched down, picking the stuff and putting it into its place.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>&lsquo;&lsquo;Yes I am, stop picking that shit up.&rsquo;&lsquo; He crouched down next to her, taking the stuff away from her, ready to throw it once again.&nbsp;<br /></i></p><p><i>&lsquo;&lsquo;No, you don&rsquo;t get it. You&rsquo;re not gonna throw it out. I don&rsquo;t care that you hate my ex. Who knows? Maybe he comes back to me one day, so I won&rsquo;t have to print them out again, maybe it will be like <b>we never faded</b>.&rsquo;&lsquo;&nbsp;<br /></i></p><p><i>&lsquo;&lsquo;Stop. Stop. Stop.&rsquo;&lsquo; He kept rubbing his tears away, his heart breaking with each tear,&nbsp;&lsquo;&lsquo;Just stop, please?&rsquo;&lsquo; He begged her,&nbsp;&lsquo;&lsquo;you&rsquo;re hurting me, please, stop.&rsquo;&lsquo;&nbsp;<br /></i></p><p><i>&lsquo;&lsquo;What about me? What about the fact that you&rsquo;ve hurt me, hm?&rsquo;&lsquo; Y/N asked him, crossing her arms in front of her.<br /></i></p><p><i>&lsquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, okay? I will throw the box away, and I&rsquo;ll donate the jewellery. Just please stop, I&rsquo;m sorry.&rsquo;&lsquo;&nbsp;<br /></i></p><p><i>&lsquo;&lsquo;You&rsquo;re sorry?&rsquo;&lsquo; A sarcastic chuckle escaped her lips, making Harry look up and meet her gaze, her sad but angry gaze.&nbsp;&lsquo;&rsquo;You&rsquo;re sorry. Great, everything is perfect again. Yay. Go us.&rsquo;&rsquo; She put her hand up, mocking the victory fist.&nbsp;&lsquo;&rsquo;You&rsquo;re unbelievable, you know?&rsquo;&rsquo; It was the last thing she said before she went to the guest bedroom and locked herself in. She left the box in the living room because all she wanted to do was cry and just call herself stupid. Doubt herself, doubt everything, break from inside out.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>Harry didn&rsquo;t follow after her, instead he took the box going over the pictures because he couldn&rsquo;t help himself. With each picture, he hated her ex even more. It made him furious and sad at the same time, because that <b>wasn&rsquo;t him</b>. He knew that back then, they didn&rsquo;t even know each other but the fact that there was a time where she wasn&rsquo;t his hurt him, because now she was the love of his life. He couldn&rsquo;t imagine a life without her, but he had fucked up. He had realised how stupid he had been, how she must have felt when she found that stupid box of his.&nbsp;</i></p><p>&lsquo;&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think she is going to break up with you, but I think she is just really mad at you, because don&rsquo;t get me wrong but you did fuck up.&rsquo;&lsquo; Harry&rsquo;s friend, Jack said.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&lsquo;&lsquo;You don&rsquo;t get it. That was four days ago and she left. Like she&rsquo;s perhaps staying in the same place as I am, but it&rsquo;s like she isn&rsquo;t there. Not once did she text me or call me, she doesn&rsquo;t sleep in the same bed as me. She just&hellip; left me, maybe not physically, but mentally. It&rsquo;s like she just gave up on me, you know.. which I get because I deserve it&hellip;&rsquo;&lsquo; Harry was ranting to his best friend, because he didn&rsquo;t speak to anyone about the whole fight, not even his mum.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&lsquo;&lsquo;Wait, so if she&rsquo;s so mad at you, how come you were supposed to go out on a date tonight? Before she cancelled, of course.&rsquo;&lsquo;<br /></p><p>&lsquo;&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know..&rsquo;&lsquo; He brushed his hand through his hair,&nbsp;&lsquo;&lsquo;I do, it&rsquo;s just&hellip; I asked her friend if she could ask Y/N for a double date, you know? But of course, it wasn&rsquo;t going to be a double date, because they weren&rsquo;t going to show up, and it was gonna be just Y/N and I.&rsquo;&lsquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&lsquo;&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you think that she kinda caught onto that? Because I&rsquo;m pretty sure Y/N isn&rsquo;t as stupid.&rsquo;&lsquo;<br /></p><p>&lsquo;&lsquo;She probably did, that&rsquo;s why she probably asked me to cancel.&rsquo;&lsquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&lsquo;&lsquo;Go home, right now.&rsquo;&lsquo; Jack insisted,&nbsp;&lsquo;&lsquo;Leave, fuck the meeting. Go buy her flowers and go apologise because you were a right dick.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p><p>Harry just nodded his head and did exactly that. He bought her a big bouquet of flowers and some chocolate and drove home. The silence as he drove was killing him and he was so anxious and nervous.&nbsp;</p><p>When he got home, he was worn to the bones. He locked the door and headed towards the living room, but he was her sitting down in front of the counter looking at him.&nbsp;</p><p>&lsquo;&lsquo;Hey.&rsquo;&lsquo; Harry said, coming closer to her and putting the flowers and the chocolate in front of her,&nbsp;&lsquo;&lsquo;These are for you.&rsquo;&lsquo; He smiled softly at her, trying to ease the tension.&nbsp;</p><p>&lsquo;&lsquo;I wasn&rsquo;t aware you were gonna be back earlier.&rsquo;&lsquo; Y/N replied, not acknowledging the flowers.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&lsquo;&lsquo;I-I, yeah, I just didn&rsquo;t have much to do, so I came home.&rsquo;&lsquo; Y/N winced at the word home, because was it? Was this <i>a home</i>?<br /></p><p>&lsquo;&lsquo;I hate when you&rsquo;re lying.&rsquo;&lsquo; She looked straight into his eyes because she knew he had quite the important meeting today.&nbsp;</p><p>&lsquo;&lsquo;I, um.. sorry.. I just wanted to come home&hellip;&rsquo;&lsquo; He hung his head low, feeling the heat of his cheeks,&nbsp;&lsquo;&lsquo;come home to you.&rsquo;&lsquo; He whispered.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&lsquo;&lsquo;Do you think, the fact that it took us this long to move in together is actually a sign that maybe we never should have?&rsquo;&lsquo; Y/N asked, looking down at her lap fidgeting with her hands.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&lsquo;&lsquo;What? No, no, no. No! That was not a sign.&rsquo;&lsquo; He waved his hands and shook his head at her,&nbsp;&lsquo;&lsquo;No, it was just we were always so busy to have some proper time to actually move. We&rsquo;ve spent so much time at each others places, it&rsquo;s just we never had time to pack and move to our own place.&rsquo;&lsquo; His heart was beating at an unusual speed, fearing her next words.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&lsquo;&lsquo;I think it was.&rsquo;&lsquo;<br /></p><p>&lsquo;&lsquo;No, Y/N stop.&rsquo;&lsquo; Harry came closer, putting his hands on her hips only to be pushed away.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&lsquo;&lsquo;Please don&rsquo;t touch me.&rsquo;&lsquo; Y/N moved away from him, hugging herself tightly.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&lsquo;&lsquo;Baby..&rsquo;&lsquo; he was hurt, his heart hurt,&nbsp;&lsquo;&lsquo;Please. Do not think that, please.&rsquo;&lsquo;<br /></p><p>&lsquo;&lsquo;You know, I never doubted you, or our love, or anything really.&rsquo;&lsquo; She looked out of the window before adding,&nbsp;&lsquo;&lsquo;But in the past week or two, I&rsquo;ve doubted everything.&rsquo;&lsquo;<br /></p><p>&lsquo;&lsquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t, because I love you. More than anything in this world. You can call mum if you want to, because she is gonna tell you that I <i>never shut up</i> about you. You&rsquo;re the love of my life, okay? And that&hellip; the past week has been a lot but it was a simple mistake, not something that should break us apart.&rsquo;&rsquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&lsquo;&lsquo;A simple mistake?&rsquo;&lsquo; She narrowed her eyes, looking at him,&nbsp;&lsquo;&lsquo;if a <i>simple </i>mistake like that could make me doubt everything, from myself to you, your love and to our relationship. Then I don&rsquo;t want to know what a big mistake could do to us.&rsquo;&lsquo;<br /></p><p>&lsquo;&lsquo;I-I didn&rsquo;t mean it like that, I&rsquo;m sorry. It&rsquo;s just, please do no doubt me, okay? You <i>know</i> I love you more than anything. You should know that, because there isn&rsquo;t anyone I love as much as you.&rsquo;&lsquo; He took a step towards her, but still keeping the distance because he was afraid of her stepping back.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&lsquo;&lsquo;Maybe we should take a small break from each other.&rsquo;&lsquo; She stated, no emotions on her face.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&lsquo;&lsquo;No! I&rsquo;m not- we&rsquo;re not breaking up. No!&rsquo;&lsquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&lsquo;&lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t say a break up, but we should separate from each other for&hellip; a little while.&rsquo;&lsquo; Y/N couldn&rsquo;t dare to look at him, because if she did, she would break down.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&lsquo;&lsquo;Separate? You didn&rsquo;t even look at me for the last five days, not once! That&rsquo;s enough of a separation. You didn&rsquo;t even sleep next to me. So we&rsquo;re not doing that. We&rsquo;re gonna be okay, do you hear me? We will talk. Tonight, we&rsquo;re gonna talk all night and we <i>will </i>be okay.&rsquo;&lsquo; He was scared, because if they take a break, he knew that would be the first step to a break up, and he wasn&rsquo;t having any of that.&nbsp;</p><p>&lsquo;&lsquo;We&rsquo;ve said enough, Harry. There is nothing more to be said.&rsquo;&lsquo;<br /></p><p>&lsquo;&lsquo;Yes there is. There is so much I want to say to you and the most important bit is how much I love you.&rsquo;&lsquo; Coming closer to her, Y/N kept taking steps back until she hit the wall. Harry was standing right in front of her, hovering over her body.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&lsquo;&lsquo;Stop, please just move.&rsquo;&lsquo;<br /></p><p>&lsquo;&lsquo;No, baby, I-I can&rsquo;t.&rsquo;&lsquo; He leaned down his forehead against hers.&nbsp;&lsquo;&lsquo;Please let us talk. I love you.&rsquo;&lsquo; Harry whispered, but Y/N only sighed and closed her eyes.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&lsquo;&lsquo;This isn&rsquo;t good for us, Harry.&rsquo;&lsquo;<br /></p><p>&lsquo;&lsquo;But it&rsquo;s love, and it&rsquo;s supposed to hurt. That&rsquo;s what love is, love is pain.&rsquo;&lsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;&lsquo;No! It isn&rsquo;t! It&rsquo;s not supposed to hurt this much! This isn&rsquo;t love! This is pain, and there is so much of it that I cannot handle it!&rsquo;&lsquo; She wanted to push him away, but she just had no strength.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&lsquo;&lsquo;Then let&rsquo;s hurt tonight. Let&rsquo;s hurt together. Let&rsquo;s go to bed, lock the door and hit the lights. We&rsquo;re not gonna leave the room until we resolve our problem. They say love is pain, so let&rsquo;s hurt.&rsquo;&lsquo;<br /></p><p>&lsquo;&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t want to, Harry, because I&rsquo;m already hurt enough and I don&rsquo;t want to hurt even more.&rsquo;&lsquo; There was no sarcasm in her voice or anger, it was just sad and low.<br /></p><p>&lsquo;&lsquo;Let&rsquo;s say all the things we couldn&rsquo;t before. If you want to yell, then yell, if you wanna cry, I will hold you and cry with you. Hell, if you want to punch something, I&rsquo;ll even let you punch me or just hold up a pillow for you. But please do not give up on us.&rsquo;&rsquo; His hands found their way up to her hips, holding her closer; his body completely pressed against hers.&nbsp;</p><p>&lsquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;m tired Harry. So tired.&rsquo;&lsquo; She trailed her hand up his chest, placing it just above his heart, feeling the speed it was beating at.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&lsquo;&lsquo;And I&rsquo;m tired of sleeping alone, because I need you and I am not ready to lose you. I won&rsquo;t lose you.&rsquo;&lsquo; He put his hand over her cheek, brushing the tears away.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&lsquo;&lsquo;I threw the box away, and sold the jewellery and donated the money from it. The box is gone, okay? She never meant anything to me, it was just there. That box isn&rsquo;t important.&rsquo;&lsquo; Harry added, reassuring her that he was hers, and he was always going to be hers.&nbsp;&lsquo;&lsquo;My heart belongs to you. I&rsquo;d give my life for you, I&rsquo;d even give my life <i>to</i> you.&rsquo;&lsquo;<br /></p><p>&lsquo;&lsquo;Let&rsquo;s go to bed.&rsquo;&lsquo; Y/N spoke, for the first time in a while. She wiggled away from his grip, heading towards their bedroom but waiting for him to join her.&nbsp;</p><p>They were sitting on their bed, backs pressed against the board, neither of them saying anything. But Harry was holding her hand, brushing his thumb over it lightly and placing kisses from time to time.&nbsp;</p><p>&lsquo;&lsquo;Do you know why I asked for a place with four bedrooms and not only one or two?&rsquo;&lsquo; Harry suddenly asked and Y/N just shook her head.&nbsp;&lsquo;&rsquo;Because I want a family.&rsquo;&rsquo; He looked over to her, meeting her eyes,&nbsp;&lsquo;&rsquo;I want a family with you one day and I wish for it to be soon. Not right now or next month, but soon because that&rsquo;s all I want.&rsquo;&rsquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&lsquo;&lsquo;You want a family with me?&rsquo;&lsquo; Her eyes widened in surprise because this topic never came up before and she indeed was surprised.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&lsquo;&lsquo;I wanna marry you, Y/N. Of course I&rsquo;d want a family too. My mum has been nagging too, surprised she didn&rsquo;t send you pictures of baby clothes to hint she wants a grandchild.&rsquo;&lsquo;<br /></p><p>&lsquo;&lsquo;Oh.. I-I.. I didn&rsquo;t know that&hellip;&rsquo;&lsquo;<br /></p><p>&lsquo;&lsquo;That&rsquo;s because you found the wrong box. I know I hurt you a lot, and please forgive me for that. I was really stupid to say those things because I get it and I just cannot get over the fact how much I hurt you.&rsquo;&lsquo; Turning to face her, he placed her in his lap and softly stroked her cheek with his thumb.&nbsp;&lsquo;&lsquo;But you found the wrong box. I know you weren&rsquo;t <i>searching</i>, but I wish you found the other one. The more important one.&rsquo;&lsquo;<br /></p><p>Y/N&rsquo;s mind was running wild, and her heart beating so fast. She felt like shaking because Harry just admitted to having a box&hellip;with a ring in it. Her eyes were wide as she kept looking at Harry, trying to see if he was messing around or really serious.</p><p>&lsquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;m not lying, I promise you.&rsquo;&lsquo; He placed her down on the bed before going inside the closed to take the red velvet box and place it in front of her. He crossed his legs as he sat down.&nbsp;&lsquo;&lsquo;Do you want to open it?&rsquo;&lsquo; Harry carefully asked, scared out of his mind. Y/N carefully took the box in her hand and opened it. There was a silver ring with<i> love</i> written on it; it was similar to his <i>peace</i> one, but this one wasn&rsquo;t as wide and it was smaller.&nbsp;</p><p>&lsquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;m begging you, do not ever doubt my love for you again because you truly are the love of my life. I know I&rsquo;ve fucked up and maybe this isn&rsquo;t the best timing but please, just let me have you. Forever.&rsquo;&lsquo; Harry took the box from her, placing it on the bed while he took her hand hovering with the ring over her finger.&nbsp;&lsquo;&lsquo;Marry me, Y/N. Let me be the man you deserve, let me love you for the rest of my life. Let me be the best father to our children. Please, I will be all of those things, just please, will you marry me?&rsquo;&lsquo; He was on the verge of crying but he contained himself. Hope in his eyes and his voice, as he waited for Y/N&rsquo;s answer.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&lsquo;&lsquo;Yes, I will marry you. A hundred times, yes.&rsquo;&lsquo; Harry&rsquo;s heart burst out of happiness when she answered the way he wanted her to.</p><p>&lsquo;&lsquo;I love you. I love you. I love you.&rsquo;&lsquo; He leaned himself and hugged her tightly,&nbsp;&lsquo;&lsquo;I love you so fucking much. Thank you.&rsquo;&rsquo; Placing kisses all over her face, he couldn&rsquo;t calm himself down because of happy he was.&nbsp;</p><p>&lsquo;&rsquo;I love you more.&rsquo;&rsquo; Y/N replied through his hungry kisses.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><i>Love was pain, and they did hurt, but that bit of pain was good because now they had each other and they were never gonna let go.&nbsp;</i></p>",

He was perfect. He treated the way you deserved to be treated, he always had time for you, and you loved each other. When he got down on one knee, during a romantic dinner while on holiday in Mykonos, you obviously said yes. The next year went by so fast, planning the wedding and balancing your work was hard, but your big day had to be one to remember, and it would be.\u00a0</p><p>Approximately one month before you tied the knot, you were having lunch with Grace, your best friend, and maid of honor. You were going through everything, the dress, the cake, and the guest list. The wedding wasn&rsquo;t going to be massive, just the right amount of people, all whom you loved and cared for. As she read down the list, when she gets to the bottom she pauses. &ldquo;What about Harry?&rdquo; she quizzes.</p><p>&ldquo;What do you mean &lsquo;What about Harry?&rsquo;&rdquo; you almost snap at her. It had been years since you talked to him. You didn&rsquo;t think inviting your ex to your wedding would be the best idea. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a good idea,&rdquo; you say to her.\u00a0</p><p>You and Harry dated on and off for about 6 years, breaking up for a week, then running back to each other. He was your first love, there were periods where you were certain it would be him you would marry, but in the back of your mind, you just felt like it could never happen. There were just too many things in your relationship that caused so many problems. His work schedule was always insane, he never had time for you. All the non-stop traveling resulted in too many lonely nights, being so far away from each other. Also, with paparazzi harassing the two of you constantly, it was all getting too much.\u00a0</p><p>After the band went on hiatus in 2015, you thought things would calm down, but slowly with his solo career, things started picking up again. Although you enjoyed traveling with him every now and again, you longed for a simple life, a normal relationship. The closest to normal the two of you ever got, was just after the hiatus. You were living together\u00a0and doing normal things.\u00a0But when things started getting busy again, Harry couldn&rsquo;t give you the normality you wanted.\u00a0</p><p>You were only a year younger than him, 18 when you first started dating, in the midst of One Direction becoming insanely famous. The lifestyle was exciting and fun, perfect for your age and stage. Even though you were only 23 when you broke up, you weren&rsquo;t cut out for the lifestyle anymore. You hated the press and paparazzi always sticking their nose in everything you did, always creating scandals when Harry would catch up with a female friend. Although that stuff never affected your relationship, it made you tired, and you were sick of it. That&rsquo;s when your relationship ended in 2018, just after his world tour ended. You had gone out to lunch with a close friend, who happened to be a male, and the paparazzi snapped the whole thing. It was all over the internet the next day. You got thousands of hate messages from fans so angry that you &ldquo;cheated on Harry&rdquo; you couldn&rsquo;t take it anymore. With the long distance, the intrusion of privacy and the longing for settling down and having a normal life, it got to you, and you broke up with Harry.</p><p>That&rsquo;s when Michael came along, just a short month after you broke up. You and Michael took things slow, dating casually for a year before making it official. Michale helped you get through the breakup. He was also a\u00a0good distraction from all the articles about Harry spotted with a new girl almost every week. Harry didn&rsquo;t deal with the break up so well. After you left him, he started going out all the time, getting shitfaced, and finding himself in all sorts of trouble. He then disappeared for about a year, where no one heard from him. He usually came up in conversation when you hung out with his friends, who you became close with when you were together. No one knew where he was.</p><p>He then came back dropping an album out of nowhere, on the same day Michael asked you to be his girlfriend. Of course, you listened to it, and every song was about you. From the good things to the bad, they were all amazing, some of the best work he had done. They were so real, so raw. He included a song that he wrote and played for you during your relationship, it was about him wanting to spend his entire life with you. The first time he played it to you, it made you cry tears of happiness, but now when you heard it, it made you feel a pang of guilt for breaking his heart. But you both knew he couldn&rsquo;t make you happy, not like Michael could. He even admitted it in one of the songs called 'You still have my heart&rsquo;.</p><p>Michale didn&rsquo;t like the fact Harry had written a whole album about you. The press, on the other hand, loved it, there were different headlines about how you broke his heart, they would analyze the lyrics and make conclusions. They would take pics of his new tattoos and somehow link them to you, and for a few months after the album came out, the paparazzi managed to track you down and harass you for how you felt about it. You never said anything. It was between you and Harry about how you felt. The most Harry said directly addressing the relationship was in an interview, he was asked &ldquo;Do you still love her?&rdquo; and he said &ldquo;I think I will always love her&rdquo; the interview then ended abruptly.\u00a0</p><p>The two of you never really reached out to each other. You texted him \u2018congratulations\u2019 when his album came out, which he replied a simple 'thanks&rsquo; to. But after you broke up, pretty much all communication stopped, but that&rsquo;s what you both needed to get over each other. You never called or made plans to hang out, mainly because since you broke up with him, you didn&rsquo;t want to give him false hope that things could happen again. He hadn&rsquo;t dated another person, of course, the press speculated every single person he hung out with, but no serious relationships.</p><p>He did invite you to his album release party, but you had to decline as Michale had a big work dinner the same evening. You sometimes think about how it would be if you did keep in contact with him. You always did get along so well with him, as you were best friends before lovers, that friendship will always be there. The only extent to rekindling your relationship as friends, was when you bumped into him at a supermarket. You were buying ingredients to make an anniversary dinner for you and Michale. It felt so normal, just how it used to be. He asked you what you were making, and that&rsquo;s when you mentioned Michale.\u00a0</p><p>He was upset, he knew you had moved on and was seeing other people, but you telling him made it real, not just something he heard from mutual friends. It was only awkward after that, but as you hugged him goodbye, a pap took a picture, which circulated the internet for the next few days, causing hysteria. Michale was angry, you tried to explain to him it was just a friendly hug, and it didn&rsquo;t mean anything. Michale didn&rsquo;t want you to you to talk to Harry anymore, not that you were even talking to him, but that definitely stopped the possibility of the two of you <g class=\"gr_ gr_142 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Grammar multiReplace\" id=\"142\" data-gr-id=\"142\">becoming</g> friends again.\u00a0</p><p>Michale was insecure. Harry was famous and dashingly handsome, he was your first love. He knew that what you and Harry shared would be greater than anything you and Michale would have. He was afraid that Harry would just come back into your life and steal you away. He was threatened by him. But Harry wouldn&rsquo;t do that. Harry knew that what you wanted was something he couldn\u2019t give you at that point in his life. Harry loved the high life, the cars, the fame, the money.\u00a0</p><p>&ldquo;Wow, I haven&rsquo;t thought about him in a <g class=\"gr_ gr_152 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"152\" data-gr-id=\"152\">while</g>&rdquo; you say relaxing back into your chair. It was true, you often used to think about him, wondering if leaving him was the right thing. After the engagement, you didn&rsquo;t have time to think about him, and it would have been wrong, you were marrying someone else. It also helped that he had seemed to disappear again, probably off to write another album or star in another movie. It was like after the breakup, no one heard from him.\u00a0</p><p>The day had arrived. You were excited but nervous. You wanted things to be perfect, you had been dreaming about this day for a long time. Marrying the man you love. As you look in the mirror, fixing your makeup, you stop to take it in. You looked at your dress, it was beautiful, just what you imagined. The dress fitter was helping you into it, and as he leaned down in front of you to straighten out the front skirt, his cologne filled your nose. It instantly bought back a million memories. It was the same cologne Harry wore. You would smell it in the mornings lingering on the sheets of the bed you shared. It would fill your senses when he hugged you after a long time apart. You still had one of his jumpers, that just faintly still smelled like it. &ldquo;Are you okay?&rdquo; he asked, as he saw your face.\u00a0</p><p>&ldquo;Uh, yeah I\u2019m fine, just the nerves,&rdquo; you say trying to block the memories out of your head.\u00a0</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be nervous love, you look amazing, and you&rsquo;re marrying the love of your life!&rdquo; he said excitedly. When your hair and makeup were all done, and the dress and veil were on. Grace asks you &ldquo;Are you ready?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, I think I just need a minute alone first&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sure, I&rsquo;ll go see if Michael and the guys are ready,&rdquo; she says walking out the door. You sit down in the makeup chair and take a deep breath. This was really happening, you were about to walk down the aisle and promise to share the rest of your life with the man you love, the man who would make you happy, and give you everything you ever wanted, a normal life. Why did it feel wrong? You had been anticipating this moment for so long. When you were with Michale it felt right, but why sitting alone in this chair in your white dress, it felt far from right.\u00a0</p><p>Maybe it was the nerves that had you second guessing, or maybe it was the cologne that bought back so many happy memories. There is a knock at the door when you open it expecting Grace to be standing there, you are surprised as it&rsquo;s not who you expected.</p><p><b><a href=\"https://hershelsstyles.tumblr.com/post/179038447664/you-are-the-love-of-my-life-pt2\">Part 2</a></b><i><b>\u00a0</b></i></p>",

The lifestyle was exciting and fun, perfect for your age and stage. Even though you were only 23 when you broke up, you weren\u2019t cut out for the lifestyle anymore. You hated the press and paparazzi always sticking their nose in everything you did, always creating scandals when Harry would catch up with a female friend. Although that stuff never affected your relationship, it made you tired, and you were sick of it. That\u2019s when your relationship ended in 2018, just after his world tour ended. You had gone out to lunch with a close friend, who happened to be a male, and the paparazzi snapped the whole thing. It was all over the internet the next day. You got thousands of hate messages from fans so angry that you \u201ccheated on Harry\u201d you couldn\u2019t take it anymore. With the long distance, the intrusion of privacy and the longing for settling down and having a normal life, it got to you, and you broke up with Harry.</p><p>That\u2019s when Michael came along, just a short month after you broke up. You and Michael took things slow, dating casually for a year before making it official. Michale helped you get through the breakup. He was also a\u00a0good distraction from all the articles about Harry spotted with a new girl almost every week. Harry didn\u2019t deal with the break up so well. After you left him, he started going out all the time, getting shitfaced, and finding himself in all sorts of trouble. He then disappeared for about a year, where no one heard from him. He usually came up in conversation when you hung out with his friends, who you became close with when you were together. No one knew where he was.</p><p>He then came back dropping an album out of nowhere, on the same day Michael asked you to be his girlfriend. Of course, you listened to it, and every song was about you. From the good things to the bad, they were all amazing, some of the best work he had done. They were so real, so raw. He included a song that he wrote and played for you during your relationship, it was about him wanting to spend his entire life with you. The first time he played it to you, it made you cry tears of happiness, but now when you heard it, it made you feel a pang of guilt for breaking his heart. But you both knew he couldn\u2019t make you happy, not like Michael could. He even admitted it in one of the songs called 'You still have my heart\u2019.</p><p>Michale didn\u2019t like the fact Harry had written a whole album about you. The press, on the other hand, loved it, there were different headlines about how you broke his heart, they would analyze the lyrics and make conclusions. They would take pics of his new tattoos and somehow link them to you, and for a few months after the album came out, the paparazzi managed to track you down and harass you for how you felt about it. You never said anything. It was between you and Harry about how you felt. The most Harry said directly addressing the relationship was in an interview, he was asked \u201cDo you still love her?\u201d and he said \u201cI think I will always love her\u201d the interview then ended abruptly.\u00a0</p><p>The two of you never really reached out to each other. You texted him \u2018congratulations\u2019 when his album came out, which he replied a simple 'thanks\u2019 to. But after you broke up, pretty much all communication stopped, but that\u2019s what you both needed to get over each other. You never called or made plans to hang out, mainly because since you broke up with him, you didn\u2019t want to give him false hope that things could happen again. He hadn\u2019t dated another person, of course, the press speculated every single person he hung out with, but no serious relationships.</p><p>He did invite you to his album release party, but you had to decline as Michale had a big work dinner the same evening. You sometimes think about how it would be if you did keep in contact with him. You always did get along so well with him, as you were best friends before lovers, that friendship will always be there. The only extent to rekindling your relationship as friends, was when you bumped into him at a supermarket. You were buying ingredients to make an anniversary dinner for you and Michale. It felt so normal, just how it used to be. He asked you what you were making, and that\u2019s when you mentioned Michale.\u00a0</p><p>He was upset, he knew you had moved on and was seeing other people, but you telling him made it real, not just something he heard from mutual friends. It was only awkward after that, but as you hugged him goodbye, a pap took a picture, which circulated the internet for the next few days, causing hysteria. Michale was angry, you tried to explain to him it was just a friendly hug, and it didn\u2019t mean anything. Michale didn\u2019t want you to you to talk to Harry anymore, not that you were even talking to him, but that definitely stopped the possibility of the two of you <g class=\"gr_ gr_142 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Grammar multiReplace\" id=\"142\" data-gr-id=\"142\">becoming</g> friends again.\u00a0</p><p>Michale was insecure. Harry was famous and dashingly handsome, he was your first love. He knew that what you and Harry shared would be greater than anything you and Michale would have. He was afraid that Harry would just come back into your life and steal you away. He was threatened by him. But Harry wouldn\u2019t do that. Harry knew that what you wanted was something he couldn\u2019t give you at that point in his life. Harry loved the high life, the cars, the fame, the money.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWow, I haven\u2019t thought about him in a <g class=\"gr_ gr_152 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"152\" data-gr-id=\"152\">while</g>\u201d you say relaxing back into your chair. It was true, you often used to think about him, wondering if leaving him was the right thing. After the engagement, you didn\u2019t have time to think about him, and it would have been wrong, you were marrying someone else. It also helped that he had seemed to disappear again, probably off to write another album or star in another movie. It was like after the breakup, no one heard from him.\u00a0</p><p>The day had arrived. You were excited but nervous. You wanted things to be perfect, you had been dreaming about this day for a long time. Marrying the man you love. As you look in the mirror, fixing your makeup, you stop to take it in. You looked at your dress, it was beautiful, just what you imagined. The dress fitter was helping you into it, and as he leaned down in front of you to straighten out the front skirt, his cologne filled your nose. It instantly bought back a million memories. It was the same cologne Harry wore. You would smell it in the mornings lingering on the sheets of the bed you shared. It would fill your senses when he hugged you after a long time apart. You still had one of his jumpers, that just faintly still smelled like it. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d he asked, as he saw your face.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cUh, yeah I\u2019m fine, just the nerves,\u201d you say trying to block the memories out of your head.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be nervous love, you look amazing, and you\u2019re marrying the love of your life!\u201d he said excitedly. When your hair and makeup were all done, and the dress and veil were on. Grace asks you \u201cAre you ready?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I think I just need a minute alone first\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, I\u2019ll go see if Michael and the guys are ready,\u201d she says walking out the door. You sit down in the makeup chair and take a deep breath. This was really happening, you were about to walk down the aisle and promise to share the rest of your life with the man you love, the man who would make you happy, and give you everything you ever wanted, a normal life. Why did it feel wrong? You had been anticipating this moment for so long. When you were with Michale it felt right, but why sitting alone in this chair in your white dress, it felt far from right.\u00a0</p><p>Maybe it was the nerves that had you second guessing, or maybe it was the cologne that bought back so many happy memories. There is a knock at the door when you open it expecting Grace to be standing there, you are surprised as it\u2019s not who you expected.</p><p><b><a href=\"https://hershelsstyles.tumblr.com/post/179038447664/you-are-the-love-of-my-life-pt2\">Part 2</a></b><i><b>\u00a0</b></i></p></p>",

He was perfect. He treated the way you deserved to be treated, he always had time for you, and you loved each other. When he got down on one knee, during a romantic dinner while on holiday in Mykonos, you obviously said yes. The next year went by so fast, planning the wedding and balancing your work was hard, but your big day had to be one to remember, and it would be.\u00a0</p><p>Approximately one month before you tied the knot, you were having lunch with Grace, your best friend, and maid of honor. You were going through everything, the dress, the cake, and the guest list. The wedding wasn\u2019t going to be massive, just the right amount of people, all whom you loved and cared for. As she read down the list, when she gets to the bottom she pauses. \u201cWhat about Harry?\u201d she quizzes.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean \u2018What about Harry?\u2019\u201d you almost snap at her.

You didn\u2019t think inviting your ex to your wedding would be the best idea. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea,\u201d you say to her.\u00a0</p><p>You and Harry dated on and off for about 6 years, breaking up for a week, then running back to each other. He was your first love, there were periods where you were certain it would be him you would marry, but in the back of your mind, you just felt like it could never happen. There were just too many things in your relationship that caused so many problems. His work schedule was always insane, he never had time for you. All the non-stop traveling resulted in too many lonely nights, being so far away from each other. Also, with paparazzi harassing the two of you constantly, it was all getting too much.\u00a0</p><p>After the band went on hiatus in 2015, you thought things would calm down, but slowly with his solo career, things started picking up again.

No one knew where he was.</p><p>He then came back dropping an album out of nowhere, on the same day Michael asked you to be his girlfriend. Of course, you listened to it, and every song was about you. From the good things to the bad, they were all amazing, some of the best work he had done. They were so real, so raw. He included a song that he wrote and played for you during your relationship, it was about him wanting to spend his entire life with you. The first time he played it to you, it made you cry tears of happiness, but now when you heard it, it made you feel a pang of guilt for breaking his heart. But you both knew he couldn&rsquo;t make you happy, not like Michael could. He even admitted it in one of the songs called 'You still have my heart&rsquo;.</p><p>Michale didn&rsquo;t like the fact Harry had written a whole album about you. The press, on the other hand, loved it, there were different headlines about how you broke his heart, they would analyze the lyrics and make conclusions. They would take pics of his new tattoos and somehow link them to you, and for a few months after the album came out, the paparazzi managed to track you down and harass you for how you felt about it. You never said anything. It was between you and Harry about how you felt. The most Harry said directly addressing the relationship was in an interview, he was asked &ldquo;Do you still love her?&rdquo; and he said &ldquo;I think I will always love her&rdquo; the interview then ended abruptly.&nbsp;</p><p>The two of you never really reached out to each other. You texted him &lsquo;congratulations&rsquo; when his album came out, which he replied a simple 'thanks&rsquo; to. But after you broke up, pretty much all communication stopped, but that&rsquo;s what you both needed to get over each other. You never called or made plans to hang out, mainly because since you broke up with him, you didn&rsquo;t want to give him false hope that things could happen again. He hadn&rsquo;t dated another person, of course, the press speculated every single person he hung out with, but no serious relationships.</p><p>He did invite you to his album release party, but you had to decline as Michale had a big work dinner the same evening. You sometimes think about how it would be if you did keep in contact with him. You always did get along so well with him, as you were best friends before lovers, that friendship will always be there. The only extent to rekindling your relationship as friends, was when you bumped into him at a supermarket. You were buying ingredients to make an anniversary dinner for you and Michale. It felt so normal, just how it used to be. He asked you what you were making, and that&rsquo;s when you mentioned Michale.&nbsp;</p><p>He was upset, he knew you had moved on and was seeing other people, but you telling him made it real, not just something he heard from mutual friends. It was only awkward after that, but as you hugged him goodbye, a pap took a picture, which circulated the internet for the next few days, causing hysteria. Michale was angry, you tried to explain to him it was just a friendly hug, and it didn&rsquo;t mean anything. Michale didn&rsquo;t want you to you to talk to Harry anymore, not that you were even talking to him, but that definitely stopped the possibility of the two of you becoming friends again.&nbsp;</p><p>Michale was insecure. Harry was famous and dashingly handsome, he was your first love. He knew that what you and Harry shared would be greater than anything you and Michale would have. He was afraid that Harry would just come back into your life and steal you away. He was threatened by him. But Harry wouldn&rsquo;t do that. Harry knew that what you wanted was something he couldn&rsquo;t give you at that point in his life. Harry loved the high life, the cars, the fame, the money.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Wow, I haven&rsquo;t thought about him in a while&rdquo; you say relaxing back into your chair. It was true, you often used to think about him, wondering if leaving him was the right thing. After the engagement, you didn&rsquo;t have time to think about him, and it would have been wrong, you were marrying someone else. It also helped that he had seemed to disappear again, probably off to write another album or star in another movie. It was like after the breakup, no one heard from him.&nbsp;</p><p>The day had arrived. You were excited but nervous. You wanted things to be perfect, you had been dreaming about this day for a long time. Marrying the man you love. As you look in the mirror, fixing your makeup, you stop to take it in. You looked at your dress, it was beautiful, just what you imagined. The dress fitter was helping you into it, and as he leaned down in front of you to straighten out the front skirt, his cologne filled your nose. It instantly bought back a million memories. It was the same cologne Harry wore. You would smell it in the mornings lingering on the sheets of the bed you shared. It would fill your senses when he hugged you after a long time apart. You still had one of his jumpers, that just faintly still smelled like it. &ldquo;Are you okay?&rdquo; he asked, as he saw your face.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Uh, yeah I&rsquo;m fine, just the nerves,&rdquo; you say trying to block the memories out of your head.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be nervous love, you look amazing, and you&rsquo;re marrying the love of your life!&rdquo; he said excitedly. When your hair and makeup were all done, and the dress and veil were on. Grace asks you &ldquo;Are you ready?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, I think I just need a minute alone first&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sure, I&rsquo;ll go see if Michael and the guys are ready,&rdquo; she says walking out the door. You sit down in the makeup chair and take a deep breath. This was really happening, you were about to walk down the aisle and promise to share the rest of your life with the man you love, the man who would make you happy, and give you everything you ever wanted, a normal life. Why did it feel wrong? You had been anticipating this moment for so long. When you were with Michale it felt right, but why sitting alone in this chair in your white dress, it felt far from right.&nbsp;</p><p>Maybe it was the nerves that had you second guessing, or maybe it was the cologne that bought back so many happy memories. There is a knock at the door when you open it expecting Grace to be standing there, you are surprised as it&rsquo;s not who you expected.</p><p><b><a href=\"https://hershelsstyles.tumblr.com/post/179038447664/you-are-the-love-of-my-life-pt2\">Part 2</a></b><i><b>&nbsp;</b></i></p></p>",

You had somehow found yourself at an after party for some movie release or another -you couldn\u2019t keep up anymore, considering your best friend was constantly dragging you to every one she had to go to for work. Due to this, you ended up making a lot of friends that also happened to be friends with Harry, and you knew soon enough you two would end up at the same event.</p><p>You weren\u2019t going to lie; you would do absolutely anything Harry Styles asked you to do, and you hadn\u2019t ever even met him. What you did know was he was gorgeous, and according to everyone around you he was also the nicest guy you would ever meet.</p><p>So here you were, leaning against the bar and watching your best friend try to pick up some rich old dude as you nursed one of the drinks someone had sent you a few moments ago. Of course, it was some creepy man who didn\u2019t understand the word \u201cno,\u201d and you had to quite literally threaten to knee him in the balls so hard he could never have kids again to get him to go away, but you still ended up with a free drink. Beggars can\u2019t be choosers, right?</p><p>\u201cReckon he\u2019s not gonna be buying any girls drinks fo\u2019awhile after that,\u201d you heard a deep voice speak up from beside you, his voice full of amusement, and you knew who it was immediately. Now, if you hadn\u2019t been slightly tipsy from the alcohol you had already downed, you probably would\u2019ve been able to reply like a normal, functioning human being, but alas, you weren\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cHoly shit, you\u2019re real,\u201d slipped out of your mouth before you could even process what exactly you were saying, and your words were met with Harry\u2019s loud laugh, his head tilting back slightly as his eyes crinkled at the corners and holy shit, was he always this beautiful?</p><p>\u201cThat I am, love. Think I was a unicorn, or somethin\u2019?\u201d He knew who she was, because he had seen her with his friends many times on social media, and he was just waiting for the day they would finally run into one another. If anything, he should\u2019ve been saying the same thing to her, because every time he arrived at a party he always caught a glimpse of her long hair trailing behind her as she exited. </p><p>\u201cNo, definitely not a unicorn,\u201d she shook her head, her nose scrunching as she looked at him and thought for a moment, \u201cMaybe like a greek god.. Yeah, that works,\u201d she was smiling now, and Harry couldn\u2019t help but smile back.</p><p>After that night, you two saw each other on the regular. You made sure to stay at the parties until Harry arrived, and Harry always made sure to arrive slightly early, just in case. You were notorious for dipping out without saying a word to anyone, which was something that definitely frustrated Harry as you two became friends.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, love!\u201d Harry was currently sitting on his bed as you were inside his bathroom, drying off from the shower you had just taken, and he was annoyed, \u201cYou could be lyin\u2019 in a ditch somewhere and no one would know! Ya can\u2019t just take off, love. How am I supposed to know y\u2019safe?\u201d He was scolding her about the night before when she had once again just taken off without a word, and Harry was tired of worrying about her; she had been doing this for a year now, and he was going to put an end to it. What if some man decided to grab her while she was walking home?</p><p>He didn\u2019t have too long to dwell on the thought, because the next minute you were screaming your lungs out and zooming out of the bathroom, only a tight towel wrapped around your still wet body. Harry\u2019s eyes were wide as he watched you clutching onto your towel to make sure it didn\u2019t fall, but his eyes still wandered over your exposed legs and to the apple of your ass that was just peaking out from under the towel.</p><p>\u201cThe bloody hell?\u201d </p><p>\u201cKILL IT! KILL IT KILL IT KILL IT! BURN THE ENTIRE APARTMENT DOWN!\u201d You were shrieking now, your eyes frantic as you pointed to the bathroom, your feet scrabbling across the floor and jumping on top of the bed.</p><p>\u201cKill what? What the hell are ya on about now?\u201d He was far too distracted by the sight of you jumping on his bed in nothing but a towel to really concentrate on anything that was happening right now, especially since the towel was slowly slipping and beginning to expose your perky breasts. </p><p>\u201cHarry fucking Styles I swear to god if you don\u2019t stop oggling me and go kill the spider in that bathroom you will never get to fuck me,\u201d your words were frantic but also sounded angry, but of course all Harry could focus on was the part where you implied if he did kill the spider, he\u2019d get to fuck you.</p><p>After a few more minutes of you screaming at him and him teasing you, he finally went into the bathroom, opting to open the window and let it out rather than just killing it. When he finally emerged from the bathroom, you were now wearing one of his band t-shirts and a pair of simple black lace panties as you laid on your stomach on his bed, your fingers tapping away on your phone. He was quick to crawl on the bed, and soon he was plopping down on top of you, letting his entire body weight crush down on you.</p><p>\u201cGet off me, you oaf,\u201d you whined, dropping your phone and trying to buck him off of you, but that only resulted in your ass grinding against his bulge which was perfectly lined up with your ass.</p><p>\u201cWell thas\u2019 no\u2019gonna get me off of ya,\u201d he groaned, his head resting on your shoulder, \u201cYou screamed like a lil\u2019 baby over a spider, didn\u2019t know you were such a wimp,\u201d his words were met with you swinging your elbow back to hit him as best as you could under his weight, but really it just resulted in you twisting your body at a weird angle.</p><p>\u201c<i>I did not scream</i>,\u201d you huffed, even though you very well knew you did. Spiders were scary, okay?</p><p>\u201cHm, is that so?\u201d He was rolling off of you now, his hands gripping onto your hips and pulling you right back against him, his legs intertwining with yours as he bumped his nose against yours, \u201cThink I could probably make ya scream about somethin\u2019 else.\u201d </p><p>You could literally hear a ringing sound in your ears at the suggestion; Harry and you had always been the flirty type since the night you met, but the thought of you both actually acting on it was enough to definitely make you want to scream again. <i>For another reason though, of course.</i></p>",

Think I was a unicorn, or somethin\u2019?\u201d He knew who she was, because he had seen her with his friends many times on social media, and he was just waiting for the day they would finally run into one another. If anything, he should\u2019ve been saying the same thing to her, because every time he arrived at a party he always caught a glimpse of her long hair trailing behind her as she exited. </p><p>\u201cNo, definitely not a unicorn,\u201d she shook her head, her nose scrunching as she looked at him and thought for a moment, \u201cMaybe like a greek god.. Yeah, that works,\u201d she was smiling now, and Harry couldn\u2019t help but smile back.</p><p>After that night, you two saw each other on the regular. You made sure to stay at the parties until Harry arrived, and Harry always made sure to arrive slightly early, just in case. You were notorious for dipping out without saying a word to anyone, which was something that definitely frustrated Harry as you two became friends.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, love!\u201d Harry was currently sitting on his bed as you were inside his bathroom, drying off from the shower you had just taken, and he was annoyed, \u201cYou could be lyin\u2019 in a ditch somewhere and no one would know! Ya can\u2019t just take off, love. How am I supposed to know y\u2019safe?\u201d He was scolding her about the night before when she had once again just taken off without a word, and Harry was tired of worrying about her; she had been doing this for a year now, and he was going to put an end to it. What if some man decided to grab her while she was walking home?</p><p>He didn\u2019t have too long to dwell on the thought, because the next minute you were screaming your lungs out and zooming out of the bathroom, only a tight towel wrapped around your still wet body. Harry\u2019s eyes were wide as he watched you clutching onto your towel to make sure it didn\u2019t fall, but his eyes still wandered over your exposed legs and to the apple of your ass that was just peaking out from under the towel.</p><p>\u201cThe bloody hell?\u201d </p><p>\u201cKILL IT! KILL IT KILL IT KILL IT! BURN THE ENTIRE APARTMENT DOWN!\u201d You were shrieking now, your eyes frantic as you pointed to the bathroom, your feet scrabbling across the floor and jumping on top of the bed.</p><p>\u201cKill what? What the hell are ya on about now?\u201d He was far too distracted by the sight of you jumping on his bed in nothing but a towel to really concentrate on anything that was happening right now, especially since the towel was slowly slipping and beginning to expose your perky breasts. </p><p>\u201cHarry fucking Styles I swear to god if you don\u2019t stop oggling me and go kill the spider in that bathroom you will never get to fuck me,\u201d your words were frantic but also sounded angry, but of course all Harry could focus on was the part where you implied if he did kill the spider, he\u2019d get to fuck you.</p><p>After a few more minutes of you screaming at him and him teasing you, he finally went into the bathroom, opting to open the window and let it out rather than just killing it. When he finally emerged from the bathroom, you were now wearing one of his band t-shirts and a pair of simple black lace panties as you laid on your stomach on his bed, your fingers tapping away on your phone. He was quick to crawl on the bed, and soon he was plopping down on top of you, letting his entire body weight crush down on you.</p><p>\u201cGet off me, you oaf,\u201d you whined, dropping your phone and trying to buck him off of you, but that only resulted in your ass grinding against his bulge which was perfectly lined up with your ass.</p><p>\u201cWell thas\u2019 no\u2019gonna get me off of ya,\u201d he groaned, his head resting on your shoulder, \u201cYou screamed like a lil\u2019 baby over a spider, didn\u2019t know you were such a wimp,\u201d his words were met with you swinging your elbow back to hit him as best as you could under his weight, but really it just resulted in you twisting your body at a weird angle.</p><p>\u201c<i>I did not scream</i>,\u201d you huffed, even though you very well knew you did. Spiders were scary, okay?</p><p>\u201cHm, is that so?\u201d He was rolling off of you now, his hands gripping onto your hips and pulling you right back against him, his legs intertwining with yours as he bumped his nose against yours, \u201cThink I could probably make ya scream about somethin\u2019 else.\u201d </p><p>You could literally hear a ringing sound in your ears at the suggestion; Harry and you had always been the flirty type since the night you met, but the thought of you both actually acting on it was enough to definitely make you want to scream again. <i>For another reason though, of course.</i></p></p>",
                "content": "<p><ul><li><b><i>Warnings: none</i></b><br /></li><li><b><i>Word Count: 1k</i></b><br /></li></ul><p>&ldquo;<i>Holy shit, you&rsquo;re real.</i>&rdquo; Were the first words you ever uttered to Harry Styles. You had somehow found yourself at an after party for some movie release or another -you couldn&rsquo;t keep up anymore, considering your best friend was constantly dragging you to every one she had to go to for work. Due to this, you ended up making a lot of friends that also happened to be friends with Harry, and you knew soon enough you two would end up at the same event.</p><p>You weren&rsquo;t going to lie; you would do absolutely anything Harry Styles asked you to do, and you hadn&rsquo;t ever even met him. What you did know was he was gorgeous, and according to everyone around you he was also the nicest guy you would ever meet.</p><p>So here you were, leaning against the bar and watching your best friend try to pick up some rich old dude as you nursed one of the drinks someone had sent you a few moments ago. Of course, it was some creepy man who didn&rsquo;t understand the word &ldquo;no,&rdquo; and you had to quite literally threaten to knee him in the balls so hard he could never have kids again to get him to go away, but you still ended up with a free drink.
