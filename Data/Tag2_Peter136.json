This meant that on Saturday, everyone slept in until the sun was high up in the sky, shining down on their faces through the sheer curtains of their hotel rooms.</p><p>Ned was the first one to wake up from the two boys, and proceeded to sing loudly as he showered and got ready for the day. Peter groaned, flipping over towards the wall as he pulled the covers over his head. Steam billows out of the restroom when Ned opens the door. He lowers his singing down to humming as he does his hair and slips on his shoes.</p><p>\u201cAre you not going to come down for breakfast? MJ and Betty are already in the courtyard waiting for us dude.\u201d Ned asks. He grabs one of the keycards from the table and glances at Peter, who has now removed the blanket from over his head and is looking at him.</p><p>\u201cI just need a second. You can go on down though.\u201d Ned nods and exits the room, leaving Peter alone to get ready.</p><p>The \u00a0day was beginning to feel rather warm, which helped Peter in leaning towards wearing some shorts and a light flannel over one of his graphic shirts he\u2019d packed. After brushing his teeth and doing his hair, he grabs his copy of the keycard and heads down to the courtyard to join his friends.</p><p>Y/N is standing at the far end gate near the kitchen, watching everyone. She wears a white sundress with tiny red printed roses, and it flutters in the wind. Her hands are cross in front of her, a look of boredom on her face. Peter glances between his friends and y/n, hesitating on who to approach first but goes for the first option. He didn\u2019t quite want his little secret that was with y/n to be shown quite yet.</p><p>\u201cHey Peter.\u201d Betty smiles up happily at her boyfriend\u2019s friend, who is settling into his seat. He smiles and looks down at his menu for the breakfast options.</p><p>\u201cHey Betty, hi MJ. How are you guys?\u201d he asks.</p><!-- more --><p>The group chats, the conversation growing into what they were planning to do with their day. Y/N was about to head to their table to take Peter\u2019s order when someone grabs her hand. She looks down to see who it is and finds a smiling Flash. Her own smile falters a bit until she recomposes herself and gently pulls away from him.</p><p>\u201cCiao, bellezza/Hello beautiful.\u201d Flash pulls the chair next to him for her to sit down while his friends watch the interaction curiously. They\u2019d known about Flash wanting to get with y/n, but weren\u2019t sure how he even planned to do that. She seemed to be more interested in Peter, after all.</p><p>\u201c<i>Ciao, Flash. Ti serve qualcosa?/Hello Flash. Do you need anything</i>\u201d y/n asks. \u201c<i>Forse un po &lsquo;di acqua in pi\u00f9?/Maybe a little extra water?</i>\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo grazie. In realt\u00e0 mi stavo chiedendo se ti piacerebbe unirti a me per un pomeriggio insieme. Solo noi/No thanks. Actually I was wondering if you&rsquo;d like to join me for an afternoon together. Only us.\u201d</p><p>Y/N opens her mouth, but hesitates to answer at all. Her gaze wanders to Peter\u2019s table, where she could see that he was watching her curiously. She sighs. She did not want to be rude, but she also did not want to spend time with someone who was rude and bullied others. She wanted to spend time with a kind boy who read to her, told her nice stories, someone with curly brown hair and kind eyes.</p><p>\u201c<i>I do not think it would be okay, Flash.</i>\u201d y/n says in her rough english. Flash\u2019s smile tightens.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Non ho bisogno di una ragione/I do not need a reason</i>\u201d</p><p>\u201cSolo un pomeriggio/Only one afternoon.\u201d</p><p>Y/N stands from the seat and takes her small notepad with her. Flash watches as she struts away, not even glancing back at him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get her later.\u201d he mutters to himself.</p><p>Peter, having watched the whole interaction is concerned when y/n approaches the table. Her once happy demeanor was gone, and she seemed drained. What had Flash told her?</p><p>\u201c<i>Sei pronto per ordinare, Peter/Are you ready to order, Peter?</i>\u201d she asks in a soft voice. The group doesn\u2019t notice anything as Peter orders, and continue to eat and chat among themselves.</p><p>When Peter is done ordering, he asks, \u201cAre you alright?\u201d</p><p>All Peter gets is a simple,\u201c<i>S\u00ec/Yes,</i>\u201d before y/n tucks her pencil behind her ear and gets going into the kitchen. It was all he got to see of y/n after breakfast. During the short time the gang was at the hotel, she would go out of her way to not bump into Peter. Flash, when asked about what he\u2019d said to her, shrugged and smiled.</p><p>\u201cMaybe she realized what a loser you are, Parker.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t focus on the picnic his friends planned. His mind kept wandering back to y/n, thinking about what was wrong. What idea had Flash planted in her head? Why had he seen her alone with him, leaving the hotel before his friends had left for the park? Had he done something wrong?</p><p>\u201cPeter, hello?\u201d MJ punches his arm, to which Peter protests. \u201cI said what are you thinking about? Is it aunt May?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2026\u201d Peter sighs and nods. \u201cI\u2019m worried about how she\u2019s doing alone. How Queens is doing.\u201d</p><p>It was not a lie. He knew aunt May would slap his wrists if she knew he was worrying about her. She wanted him to enjoy his vacation, to take in all the sites and not think about home. He was worried about crime in Queens, in New York really, although that was already taken care of anyways. His Avengers friends were always there, and Spider-Man being gone wouldn\u2019t make things too bad. Even then, his aunt had packed his suit \u201cjust in case\u201d he needed it in Italy, which he hadn\u2019t.</p><p>Ned pats his friends arm understandingly. \u201cEverything back home is fine. Aunt May wouldn\u2019t want you thinking about her right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay to be homesick, Peter. Especially if you\u2019ve never been so far away from everything. But you\u2019ve got us, and we are going to make sure you have fun.\u201d Betty smiles at him. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s play with the frisbee I packed.\u201d</p><p>After she materializes a pink plastic disk from her backpack everyone spreads out on the field. The warm day was perfect for a game of frisbee, especially because the wind had died down and wouldn\u2019t be interfering with the way it flew. A couple classmates who\u2019d also decided to go to the park that afternoon joined the game. A few locals who had just been taking a dip in the lake joined them as well, calling for an even bigger space to throw the plastic circle around.</p><p>Once the sun began to set and the sky changed from blue to oranges and reds and pinks, everyone began dispersing and going home. Peter packed up the picnic basket and handed it to Betty, and Ned took her backpack. MJ folded up the blanket, and with that the group was ready to head back to the hotel.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to get us a good table for dinner, I\u2019ll see you guys in a bit.\u201d Peter says. His friends, thinking nothing of it, head up to their rooms to drop off their things while Peter heads towards the courtyard, where he guessed y/n may be. He was right, but she wasn&rsquo;t alone.</p><p>Flash sat next to her on the bench that y/n and Peter typically sat at to read, and his arm was snaking its way around her shoulders. Peter watches as she goes to shrug him off, only for Flash to pull her closer. He leans into her ear and whispers something, which seems to be the last straw as y/n gets up and pushes his off of her.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing to y/n?\u201d Peter asks, making his way towards the two. Y/N, surprised, glances at Peter and gives him a thankful look. Flash looks irritated and sighs, standing up.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it to you, Parker? Y/N and I were just getting to know each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLooks to me that you were about to leave.\u201d</p><p>Flash is taken by surprise by Peter\u2019s words directed at him. He did not expect Peter to show up, much less for him to talk to him that way. Flash scoffs and glares at the two of them. Y/N is now standing behind Peter, holding on to his arm. Their classmates were beginning to arrive down for dinner, so Flash gives up for the time being.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t over, Parker.\u201d</p><p>Y/N and Peter watch as Flash heads inside to the eating area, and Peter can feel as y/n relaxes once he\u2019s gone. He turns to her and cups her face, studying her to make sure that she is okay.</p><p>\u201cStai bene/Are you okay?\u201d</p><p>Y/N nods, smiling up softly at the American boy. \u201c<i>lo sono ora/I am now.</i>\u00a0<i>Thank</i> <i>you</i>.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Perhaps you should go and meet your friends before they wonder what is going on. I will see you after?</i>\u201d she asks hopefully. Peter nods, and on a whim, leans down to kiss her forehead. He freezes like that once he realizes what he\u2019s done, and y/n giggles. She cups his face and pecks his cheeks. \u201c<i>Go</i>.\u201d</p><p>Peter goes to one of the empty tables and sits to wait for his friends. His face was still bright red, but thankfully, with the sun setting, it was not that noticeable.</p><p>\u201cSorry for taking so long, Betty and MJ showered and are taking forever to get ready so I just came down.\u201d Ned sighs, plopping down on one of the chairs next to Peter. Peter looks up at his friend and nods. \u201cDid I miss anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean, Flash harassing y/n, the girl who works here? Other then that, I guess not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s the daughter of the owners of the hotel, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Peter nods. \u201cThe pretty one.\u201d</p><p>Although Peter says this in a rather hushes tone, Ned hears it and grins. \u201cDo you like her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Peter is flustered and unsure of what to say. Ned shakes his head and sighs.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Peter. It\u2019s been forever since Liz, so I think it was only a matter of time before you liked someone else.\u201d</p><p>Before Peter could say anything else, Betty and MJ join the boys and the group begins browsing the menu, which offered different things everyday. It helped keep a variation on the foods that the hotel guests could eat, which was great. When y/n makes her way over to take their order, Ned eyes Peter teasingly, which only makes him blush even more. Y/N doesn\u2019t really understand what is going on but doesn\u2019t ask. Instead, she picks up their menus and tells them that someone will bring up their drinks and food in a minute.</p><p>As planned, Peter waits for y/n after everyone is done with dinner. Most of his classmates had gone down to the game room to play pool and whatnot, while others were either in their room or in the courtyard. Y/N comes out of the kitchen , but today she is not holding her copy of Call Me By Your Name.</p><p>\u201c<i>Scusate per il ritardo/Sorry for the delay</i>.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNon ti preoccupare, non mi dispiace/Do not worry, I don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>Y/N smiles at him, the corners of her eyes wrinkling. She offers her hand, which Peter takes shyly.</p><p>\u201c<i>We can go on a walk today? A break from reading.</i>\u201d y/n suggests.</p><p>Peter agrees, and the two exit the hotel and walk down the worn sidewalk. The sun has long since gone down, and in its place was a pale, full moon. Crickets chirped from somewhere nearby, and the leaves rustled gently, dancing with the wind. Peter wasn\u2019t necessarily sure where y/n was taking him, but he didn\u2019t mind. As long as he was with her, he felt at ease, and he hoped she felt the same way. They end up at the park that Peter had been at earlier that day, and the two walk towards the sandy shore of the lake. Warm water rippled from the center of the lake towards the edge, causing the tiniest waves. The moon\u2019s reflection lit up the area, lit up y/n\u2019s face even, as he turned to look at her.</p><p>She wore a thoughtful look on her face. Her loose hair tumbled down her shoulders, and Peter gave into his urge of tucking some behind her ear. Y/N smiled as she turned to look at him.</p><p>\u201cFlash ti ha ferito/Did Flash hurt you?\u201d Peter asks quietly.</p><p>\u201c<i>No. Ma parliamo di qualcos'altro/No, but let\u2019s talk about something else, please?</i>\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>The couple sits down close to each other and look out at the water, silent for a moment before y/n talks. She asks about Peter\u2019s life in New York, what the states are like and his family and friends. As the two talk, y/n rests her head on his shoulders, curling up closer to the boy. After a moment of hesitation, Peter puts an arm around her, which she holds with her own.</p><p>It had not been the best day, not for y/n, but being here with a boy like Peter, near calming waters talking about each other, she hoped it would mean it would all be okay. At least for tonight. She was glad Peter didn\u2019t push her to talk about things she didn&rsquo;t want to. That he cared about her feelings, and above all, he respected her. Peter was what she wanted in a boy.</p><p><i>taglist below the cut</i></p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014-</p><p>taglist: </p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mnPe53J7tWm2XHU4k8dMO2Q\"

She wears a white sundress with tiny red printed roses, and it flutters in the wind. Her hands are cross in front of her, a look of boredom on her face. Peter glances between his friends and y/n, hesitating on who to approach first but goes for the first option. He didn\u2019t quite want his little secret that was with y/n to be shown quite yet.</p><p>\u201cHey Peter.\u201d Betty smiles up happily at her boyfriend\u2019s friend, who is settling into his seat. He smiles and looks down at his menu for the breakfast options.</p><p>\u201cHey Betty, hi MJ. How are you guys?\u201d he asks.</p>[[MORE]]<p>The group chats, the conversation growing into what they were planning to do with their day. Y/N was about to head to their table to take Peter\u2019s order when someone grabs her hand. She looks down to see who it is and finds a smiling Flash. Her own smile falters a bit until she recomposes herself and gently pulls away from him.</p><p>\u201cCiao, bellezza/Hello beautiful.\u201d Flash pulls the chair next to him for her to sit down while his friends watch the interaction curiously. They\u2019d known about Flash wanting to get with y/n, but weren\u2019t sure how he even planned to do that. She seemed to be more interested in Peter, after all.</p><p>\u201c<i>Ciao, Flash. Ti serve qualcosa?/Hello Flash. Do you need anything</i>\u201d y/n asks. \u201c<i>Forse un po \u2018di acqua in pi\u00f9?/Maybe a little extra water?</i>\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo grazie. In realt\u00e0 mi stavo chiedendo se ti piacerebbe unirti a me per un pomeriggio insieme. Solo noi/No thanks. Actually I was wondering if you\u2019d like to join me for an afternoon together. Only us.\u201d</p><p>Y/N opens her mouth, but hesitates to answer at all. Her gaze wanders to Peter\u2019s table, where she could see that he was watching her curiously. She sighs. She did not want to be rude, but she also did not want to spend time with someone who was rude and bullied others. She wanted to spend time with a kind boy who read to her, told her nice stories, someone with curly brown hair and kind eyes.</p><p>\u201c<i>I do not think it would be okay, Flash.</i>\u201d y/n says in her rough english. Flash\u2019s smile tightens.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Non ho bisogno di una ragione/I do not need a reason</i>\u201d</p><p>\u201cSolo un pomeriggio/Only one afternoon.\u201d</p><p>Y/N stands from the seat and takes her small notepad with her. Flash watches as she struts away, not even glancing back at him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get her later.\u201d he mutters to himself.</p><p>Peter, having watched the whole interaction is concerned when y/n approaches the table. Her once happy demeanor was gone, and she seemed drained. What had Flash told her?</p><p>\u201c<i>Sei pronto per ordinare, Peter/Are you ready to order, Peter?</i>\u201d she asks in a soft voice. The group doesn\u2019t notice anything as Peter orders, and continue to eat and chat among themselves.</p><p>When Peter is done ordering, he asks, \u201cAre you alright?\u201d</p><p>All Peter gets is a simple,\u201c<i>S\u00ec/Yes,</i>\u201d before y/n tucks her pencil behind her ear and gets going into the kitchen. It was all he got to see of y/n after breakfast. During the short time the gang was at the hotel, she would go out of her way to not bump into Peter. Flash, when asked about what he\u2019d said to her, shrugged and smiled.</p><p>\u201cMaybe she realized what a loser you are, Parker.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t focus on the picnic his friends planned. His mind kept wandering back to y/n, thinking about what was wrong. What idea had Flash planted in her head? Why had he seen her alone with him, leaving the hotel before his friends had left for the park? Had he done something wrong?</p><p>\u201cPeter, hello?\u201d MJ punches his arm, to which Peter protests. \u201cI said what are you thinking about? Is it aunt May?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2026\u201d Peter sighs and nods. \u201cI\u2019m worried about how she\u2019s doing alone. How Queens is doing.\u201d</p><p>It was not a lie. He knew aunt May would slap his wrists if she knew he was worrying about her. She wanted him to enjoy his vacation, to take in all the sites and not think about home. He was worried about crime in Queens, in New York really, although that was already taken care of anyways. His Avengers friends were always there, and Spider-Man being gone wouldn\u2019t make things too bad. Even then, his aunt had packed his suit \u201cjust in case\u201d he needed it in Italy, which he hadn\u2019t.</p><p>Ned pats his friends arm understandingly. \u201cEverything back home is fine. Aunt May wouldn\u2019t want you thinking about her right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay to be homesick, Peter. Especially if you\u2019ve never been so far away from everything. But you\u2019ve got us, and we are going to make sure you have fun.\u201d Betty smiles at him. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s play with the frisbee I packed.\u201d</p><p>After she materializes a pink plastic disk from her backpack everyone spreads out on the field. The warm day was perfect for a game of frisbee, especially because the wind had died down and wouldn\u2019t be interfering with the way it flew. A couple classmates who\u2019d also decided to go to the park that afternoon joined the game. A few locals who had just been taking a dip in the lake joined them as well, calling for an even bigger space to throw the plastic circle around.</p><p>Once the sun began to set and the sky changed from blue to oranges and reds and pinks, everyone began dispersing and going home. Peter packed up the picnic basket and handed it to Betty, and Ned took her backpack. MJ folded up the blanket, and with that the group was ready to head back to the hotel.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to get us a good table for dinner, I\u2019ll see you guys in a bit.\u201d Peter says. His friends, thinking nothing of it, head up to their rooms to drop off their things while Peter heads towards the courtyard, where he guessed y/n may be. He was right, but she wasn\u2019t alone.</p><p>Flash sat next to her on the bench that y/n and Peter typically sat at to read, and his arm was snaking its way around her shoulders. Peter watches as she goes to shrug him off, only for Flash to pull her closer. He leans into her ear and whispers something, which seems to be the last straw as y/n gets up and pushes his off of her.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing to y/n?\u201d Peter asks, making his way towards the two. Y/N, surprised, glances at Peter and gives him a thankful look. Flash looks irritated and sighs, standing up.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it to you, Parker? Y/N and I were just getting to know each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLooks to me that you were about to leave.\u201d</p><p>Flash is taken by surprise by Peter\u2019s words directed at him. He did not expect Peter to show up, much less for him to talk to him that way. Flash scoffs and glares at the two of them. Y/N is now standing behind Peter, holding on to his arm. Their classmates were beginning to arrive down for dinner, so Flash gives up for the time being.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t over, Parker.\u201d</p><p>Y/N and Peter watch as Flash heads inside to the eating area, and Peter can feel as y/n relaxes once he\u2019s gone. He turns to her and cups her face, studying her to make sure that she is okay.</p><p>\u201cStai bene/Are you okay?\u201d</p><p>Y/N nods, smiling up softly at the American boy. \u201c<i>lo sono ora/I am now.</i>\u00a0<i>Thank</i> <i>you</i>.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Perhaps you should go and meet your friends before they wonder what is going on. I will see you after?</i>\u201d she asks hopefully. Peter nods, and on a whim, leans down to kiss her forehead. He freezes like that once he realizes what he\u2019s done, and y/n giggles. She cups his face and pecks his cheeks. \u201c<i>Go</i>.\u201d</p><p>Peter goes to one of the empty tables and sits to wait for his friends. His face was still bright red, but thankfully, with the sun setting, it was not that noticeable.</p><p>\u201cSorry for taking so long, Betty and MJ showered and are taking forever to get ready so I just came down.\u201d Ned sighs, plopping down on one of the chairs next to Peter. Peter looks up at his friend and nods. \u201cDid I miss anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean, Flash harassing y/n, the girl who works here? Other then that, I guess not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s the daughter of the owners of the hotel, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Peter nods. \u201cThe pretty one.\u201d</p><p>Although Peter says this in a rather hushes tone, Ned hears it and grins. \u201cDo you like her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Peter is flustered and unsure of what to say. Ned shakes his head and sighs.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Peter. It\u2019s been forever since Liz, so I think it was only a matter of time before you liked someone else.\u201d</p><p>Before Peter could say anything else, Betty and MJ join the boys and the group begins browsing the menu, which offered different things everyday. It helped keep a variation on the foods that the hotel guests could eat, which was great. When y/n makes her way over to take their order, Ned eyes Peter teasingly, which only makes him blush even more. Y/N doesn\u2019t really understand what is going on but doesn\u2019t ask. Instead, she picks up their menus and tells them that someone will bring up their drinks and food in a minute.</p><p>As planned, Peter waits for y/n after everyone is done with dinner. Most of his classmates had gone down to the game room to play pool and whatnot, while others were either in their room or in the courtyard. Y/N comes out of the kitchen , but today she is not holding her copy of Call Me By Your Name.</p><p>\u201c<i>Scusate per il ritardo/Sorry for the delay</i>.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNon ti preoccupare, non mi dispiace/Do not worry, I don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>Y/N smiles at him, the corners of her eyes wrinkling. She offers her hand, which Peter takes shyly.</p><p>\u201c<i>We can go on a walk today? A break from reading.</i>\u201d y/n suggests.</p><p>Peter agrees, and the two exit the hotel and walk down the worn sidewalk. The sun has long since gone down, and in its place was a pale, full moon. Crickets chirped from somewhere nearby, and the leaves rustled gently, dancing with the wind. Peter wasn\u2019t necessarily sure where y/n was taking him, but he didn\u2019t mind. As long as he was with her, he felt at ease, and he hoped she felt the same way. They end up at the park that Peter had been at earlier that day, and the two walk towards the sandy shore of the lake. Warm water rippled from the center of the lake towards the edge, causing the tiniest waves. The moon\u2019s reflection lit up the area, lit up y/n\u2019s face even, as he turned to look at her.</p><p>She wore a thoughtful look on her face. Her loose hair tumbled down her shoulders, and Peter gave into his urge of tucking some behind her ear. Y/N smiled as she turned to look at him.</p><p>\u201cFlash ti ha ferito/Did Flash hurt you?\u201d Peter asks quietly.</p><p>\u201c<i>No. Ma parliamo di qualcos'altro/No, but let\u2019s talk about something else, please?</i>\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>The couple sits down close to each other and look out at the water, silent for a moment before y/n talks. She asks about Peter\u2019s life in New York, what the states are like and his family and friends. As the two talk, y/n rests her head on his shoulders, curling up closer to the boy. After a moment of hesitation, Peter puts an arm around her, which she holds with her own.</p><p>It had not been the best day, not for y/n, but being here with a boy like Peter, near calming waters talking about each other, she hoped it would mean it would all be okay. At least for tonight. She was glad Peter didn\u2019t push her to talk about things she didn\u2019t want to. That he cared about her feelings, and above all, he respected her. Peter was what she wanted in a boy.</p><p><i>taglist below the cut</i></p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014-</p><p>taglist: </p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mnPe53J7tWm2XHU4k8dMO2Q\"

This meant that on Saturday, everyone slept in until the sun was high up in the sky, shining down on their faces through the sheer curtains of their hotel rooms.</p><p>Ned was the first one to wake up from the two boys, and proceeded to sing loudly as he showered and got ready for the day. Peter groaned, flipping over towards the wall as he pulled the covers over his head. Steam billows out of the restroom when Ned opens the door. He lowers his singing down to humming as he does his hair and slips on his shoes.</p><p>\u201cAre you not going to come down for breakfast? MJ and Betty are already in the courtyard waiting for us dude.\u201d Ned asks. He grabs one of the keycards from the table and glances at Peter, who has now removed the blanket from over his head and is looking at him.</p><p>\u201cI just need a second. You can go on down though.\u201d Ned nods and exits the room, leaving Peter alone to get ready.</p><p>The \u00a0day was beginning to feel rather warm, which helped Peter in leaning towards wearing some shorts and a light flannel over one of his graphic shirts he\u2019d packed. After brushing his teeth and doing his hair, he grabs his copy of the keycard and heads down to the courtyard to join his friends.</p><p>Y/N is standing at the far end gate near the kitchen, watching everyone. She wears a white sundress with tiny red printed roses, and it flutters in the wind. Her hands are cross in front of her, a look of boredom on her face. Peter glances between his friends and y/n, hesitating on who to approach first but goes for the first option. He didn\u2019t quite want his little secret that was with y/n to be shown quite yet.</p><p>\u201cHey Peter.\u201d Betty smiles up happily at her boyfriend\u2019s friend, who is settling into his seat. He smiles and looks down at his menu for the breakfast options.</p><p>\u201cHey Betty, hi MJ. How are you guys?\u201d he asks.</p>[[MORE]]<p>The group chats, the conversation growing into what they were planning to do with their day. Y/N was about to head to their table to take Peter\u2019s order when someone grabs her hand. She looks down to see who it is and finds a smiling Flash. Her own smile falters a bit until she recomposes herself and gently pulls away from him.</p><p>\u201cCiao, bellezza/Hello beautiful.\u201d Flash pulls the chair next to him for her to sit down while his friends watch the interaction curiously. They\u2019d known about Flash wanting to get with y/n, but weren\u2019t sure how he even planned to do that. She seemed to be more interested in Peter, after all.</p><p>\u201c<i>Ciao, Flash. Ti serve qualcosa?/Hello Flash. Do you need anything</i>\u201d y/n asks. \u201c<i>Forse un po \u2018di acqua in pi\u00f9?/Maybe a little extra water?</i>\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo grazie. In realt\u00e0 mi stavo chiedendo se ti piacerebbe unirti a me per un pomeriggio insieme. Solo noi/No thanks. Actually I was wondering if you\u2019d like to join me for an afternoon together. Only us.\u201d</p><p>Y/N opens her mouth, but hesitates to answer at all. Her gaze wanders to Peter\u2019s table, where she could see that he was watching her curiously. She sighs. She did not want to be rude, but she also did not want to spend time with someone who was rude and bullied others. She wanted to spend time with a kind boy who read to her, told her nice stories, someone with curly brown hair and kind eyes.</p><p>\u201c<i>I do not think it would be okay, Flash.</i>\u201d y/n says in her rough english. Flash\u2019s smile tightens.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Non ho bisogno di una ragione/I do not need a reason</i>\u201d</p><p>\u201cSolo un pomeriggio/Only one afternoon.\u201d</p><p>Y/N stands from the seat and takes her small notepad with her. Flash watches as she struts away, not even glancing back at him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get her later.\u201d he mutters to himself.</p><p>Peter, having watched the whole interaction is concerned when y/n approaches the table. Her once happy demeanor was gone, and she seemed drained. What had Flash told her?</p><p>\u201c<i>Sei pronto per ordinare, Peter/Are you ready to order, Peter?</i>\u201d she asks in a soft voice. The group doesn\u2019t notice anything as Peter orders, and continue to eat and chat among themselves.</p><p>When Peter is done ordering, he asks, \u201cAre you alright?\u201d</p><p>All Peter gets is a simple,\u201c<i>S\u00ec/Yes,</i>\u201d before y/n tucks her pencil behind her ear and gets going into the kitchen. It was all he got to see of y/n after breakfast. During the short time the gang was at the hotel, she would go out of her way to not bump into Peter. Flash, when asked about what he\u2019d said to her, shrugged and smiled.</p><p>\u201cMaybe she realized what a loser you are, Parker.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t focus on the picnic his friends planned. His mind kept wandering back to y/n, thinking about what was wrong. What idea had Flash planted in her head? Why had he seen her alone with him, leaving the hotel before his friends had left for the park? Had he done something wrong?</p><p>\u201cPeter, hello?\u201d MJ punches his arm, to which Peter protests. \u201cI said what are you thinking about? Is it aunt May?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2026\u201d Peter sighs and nods. \u201cI\u2019m worried about how she\u2019s doing alone. How Queens is doing.\u201d</p><p>It was not a lie. He knew aunt May would slap his wrists if she knew he was worrying about her. She wanted him to enjoy his vacation, to take in all the sites and not think about home. He was worried about crime in Queens, in New York really, although that was already taken care of anyways. His Avengers friends were always there, and Spider-Man being gone wouldn\u2019t make things too bad. Even then, his aunt had packed his suit \u201cjust in case\u201d he needed it in Italy, which he hadn\u2019t.</p><p>Ned pats his friends arm understandingly. \u201cEverything back home is fine. Aunt May wouldn\u2019t want you thinking about her right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay to be homesick, Peter. Especially if you\u2019ve never been so far away from everything. But you\u2019ve got us, and we are going to make sure you have fun.\u201d Betty smiles at him. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s play with the frisbee I packed.\u201d</p><p>After she materializes a pink plastic disk from her backpack everyone spreads out on the field. The warm day was perfect for a game of frisbee, especially because the wind had died down and wouldn\u2019t be interfering with the way it flew. A couple classmates who\u2019d also decided to go to the park that afternoon joined the game. A few locals who had just been taking a dip in the lake joined them as well, calling for an even bigger space to throw the plastic circle around.</p><p>Once the sun began to set and the sky changed from blue to oranges and reds and pinks, everyone began dispersing and going home. Peter packed up the picnic basket and handed it to Betty, and Ned took her backpack. MJ folded up the blanket, and with that the group was ready to head back to the hotel.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to get us a good table for dinner, I\u2019ll see you guys in a bit.\u201d Peter says. His friends, thinking nothing of it, head up to their rooms to drop off their things while Peter heads towards the courtyard, where he guessed y/n may be. He was right, but she wasn\u2019t alone.</p><p>Flash sat next to her on the bench that y/n and Peter typically sat at to read, and his arm was snaking its way around her shoulders. Peter watches as she goes to shrug him off, only for Flash to pull her closer. He leans into her ear and whispers something, which seems to be the last straw as y/n gets up and pushes his off of her.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing to y/n?\u201d Peter asks, making his way towards the two. Y/N, surprised, glances at Peter and gives him a thankful look. Flash looks irritated and sighs, standing up.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it to you, Parker? Y/N and I were just getting to know each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLooks to me that you were about to leave.\u201d</p><p>Flash is taken by surprise by Peter\u2019s words directed at him. He did not expect Peter to show up, much less for him to talk to him that way. Flash scoffs and glares at the two of them. Y/N is now standing behind Peter, holding on to his arm. Their classmates were beginning to arrive down for dinner, so Flash gives up for the time being.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t over, Parker.\u201d</p><p>Y/N and Peter watch as Flash heads inside to the eating area, and Peter can feel as y/n relaxes once he\u2019s gone. He turns to her and cups her face, studying her to make sure that she is okay.</p><p>\u201cStai bene/Are you okay?\u201d</p><p>Y/N nods, smiling up softly at the American boy. \u201c<i>lo sono ora/I am now.</i>\u00a0<i>Thank</i> <i>you</i>.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Perhaps you should go and meet your friends before they wonder what is going on. I will see you after?</i>\u201d she asks hopefully. Peter nods, and on a whim, leans down to kiss her forehead. He freezes like that once he realizes what he\u2019s done, and y/n giggles. She cups his face and pecks his cheeks. \u201c<i>Go</i>.\u201d</p><p>Peter goes to one of the empty tables and sits to wait for his friends. His face was still bright red, but thankfully, with the sun setting, it was not that noticeable.</p><p>\u201cSorry for taking so long, Betty and MJ showered and are taking forever to get ready so I just came down.\u201d Ned sighs, plopping down on one of the chairs next to Peter. Peter looks up at his friend and nods. \u201cDid I miss anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean, Flash harassing y/n, the girl who works here? Other then that, I guess not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s the daughter of the owners of the hotel, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Peter nods. \u201cThe pretty one.\u201d</p><p>Although Peter says this in a rather hushes tone, Ned hears it and grins. \u201cDo you like her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Peter is flustered and unsure of what to say. Ned shakes his head and sighs.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Peter. It\u2019s been forever since Liz, so I think it was only a matter of time before you liked someone else.\u201d</p><p>Before Peter could say anything else, Betty and MJ join the boys and the group begins browsing the menu, which offered different things everyday. It helped keep a variation on the foods that the hotel guests could eat, which was great. When y/n makes her way over to take their order, Ned eyes Peter teasingly, which only makes him blush even more. Y/N doesn\u2019t really understand what is going on but doesn\u2019t ask. Instead, she picks up their menus and tells them that someone will bring up their drinks and food in a minute.</p><p>As planned, Peter waits for y/n after everyone is done with dinner. Most of his classmates had gone down to the game room to play pool and whatnot, while others were either in their room or in the courtyard. Y/N comes out of the kitchen , but today she is not holding her copy of Call Me By Your Name.</p><p>\u201c<i>Scusate per il ritardo/Sorry for the delay</i>.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNon ti preoccupare, non mi dispiace/Do not worry, I don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>Y/N smiles at him, the corners of her eyes wrinkling. She offers her hand, which Peter takes shyly.</p><p>\u201c<i>We can go on a walk today? A break from reading.</i>\u201d y/n suggests.</p><p>Peter agrees, and the two exit the hotel and walk down the worn sidewalk. The sun has long since gone down, and in its place was a pale, full moon. Crickets chirped from somewhere nearby, and the leaves rustled gently, dancing with the wind. Peter wasn\u2019t necessarily sure where y/n was taking him, but he didn\u2019t mind. As long as he was with her, he felt at ease, and he hoped she felt the same way. They end up at the park that Peter had been at earlier that day, and the two walk towards the sandy shore of the lake. Warm water rippled from the center of the lake towards the edge, causing the tiniest waves. The moon\u2019s reflection lit up the area, lit up y/n\u2019s face even, as he turned to look at her.</p><p>She wore a thoughtful look on her face. Her loose hair tumbled down her shoulders, and Peter gave into his urge of tucking some behind her ear. Y/N smiled as she turned to look at him.</p><p>\u201cFlash ti ha ferito/Did Flash hurt you?\u201d Peter asks quietly.</p><p>\u201c<i>No. Ma parliamo di qualcos'altro/No, but let\u2019s talk about something else, please?</i>\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>The couple sits down close to each other and look out at the water, silent for a moment before y/n talks. She asks about Peter\u2019s life in New York, what the states are like and his family and friends. As the two talk, y/n rests her head on his shoulders, curling up closer to the boy. After a moment of hesitation, Peter puts an arm around her, which she holds with her own.</p><p>It had not been the best day, not for y/n, but being here with a boy like Peter, near calming waters talking about each other, she hoped it would mean it would all be okay. At least for tonight. She was glad Peter didn\u2019t push her to talk about things she didn\u2019t want to. That he cared about her feelings, and above all, he respected her. Peter was what she wanted in a boy.</p><p><i>taglist below the cut</i></p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014-</p><p>taglist: </p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mnPe53J7tWm2XHU4k8dMO2Q\"

This meant that on Saturday, everyone slept in until the sun was high up in the sky, shining down on their faces through the sheer curtains of their hotel rooms.</p><p>Ned was the first one to wake up from the two boys, and proceeded to sing loudly as he showered and got ready for the day. Peter groaned, flipping over towards the wall as he pulled the covers over his head. Steam billows out of the restroom when Ned opens the door. He lowers his singing down to humming as he does his hair and slips on his shoes.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you not going to come down for breakfast? MJ and Betty are already in the courtyard waiting for us dude.&rdquo; Ned asks. He grabs one of the keycards from the table and glances at Peter, who has now removed the blanket from over his head and is looking at him.</p><p>&ldquo;I just need a second. You can go on down though.&rdquo; Ned nods and exits the room, leaving Peter alone to get ready.</p><p>The &nbsp;day was beginning to feel rather warm, which helped Peter in leaning towards wearing some shorts and a light flannel over one of his graphic shirts he&rsquo;d packed. After brushing his teeth and doing his hair, he grabs his copy of the keycard and heads down to the courtyard to join his friends.</p><p>Y/N is standing at the far end gate near the kitchen, watching everyone. She wears a white sundress with tiny red printed roses, and it flutters in the wind. Her hands are cross in front of her, a look of boredom on her face. Peter glances between his friends and y/n, hesitating on who to approach first but goes for the first option. He didn&rsquo;t quite want his little secret that was with y/n to be shown quite yet.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey Peter.&rdquo; Betty smiles up happily at her boyfriend&rsquo;s friend, who is settling into his seat. He smiles and looks down at his menu for the breakfast options.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey Betty, hi MJ. How are you guys?&rdquo; he asks.</p><p>The group chats, the conversation growing into what they were planning to do with their day. Y/N was about to head to their table to take Peter&rsquo;s order when someone grabs her hand. She looks down to see who it is and finds a smiling Flash. Her own smile falters a bit until she recomposes herself and gently pulls away from him.</p><p>&ldquo;Ciao, bellezza/Hello beautiful.&rdquo; Flash pulls the chair next to him for her to sit down while his friends watch the interaction curiously. They&rsquo;d known about Flash wanting to get with y/n, but weren&rsquo;t sure how he even planned to do that. She seemed to be more interested in Peter, after all.</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Ciao, Flash. Ti serve qualcosa?/Hello Flash. Do you need anything</i>&rdquo; y/n asks. &ldquo;<i>Forse un po &lsquo;di acqua in pi&ugrave;?/Maybe a little extra water?</i>&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No grazie. In realt&agrave; mi stavo chiedendo se ti piacerebbe unirti a me per un pomeriggio insieme. Solo noi/No thanks. Actually I was wondering if you&rsquo;d like to join me for an afternoon together. Only us.&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N opens her mouth, but hesitates to answer at all. Her gaze wanders to Peter&rsquo;s table, where she could see that he was watching her curiously. She sighs. She did not want to be rude, but she also did not want to spend time with someone who was rude and bullied others. She wanted to spend time with a kind boy who read to her, told her nice stories, someone with curly brown hair and kind eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;<i>I do not think it would be okay, Flash.</i>&rdquo; y/n says in her rough english. Flash&rsquo;s smile tightens.</p><p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Non ho bisogno di una ragione/I do not need a reason</i>&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Solo un pomeriggio/Only one afternoon.&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N stands from the seat and takes her small notepad with her. Flash watches as she struts away, not even glancing back at him.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get her later.&rdquo; he mutters to himself.</p><p>Peter, having watched the whole interaction is concerned when y/n approaches the table. Her once happy demeanor was gone, and she seemed drained. What had Flash told her?</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Sei pronto per ordinare, Peter/Are you ready to order, Peter?</i>&rdquo; she asks in a soft voice. The group doesn&rsquo;t notice anything as Peter orders, and continue to eat and chat among themselves.</p><p>When Peter is done ordering, he asks, &ldquo;Are you alright?&rdquo;</p><p>All Peter gets is a simple,&ldquo;<i>S&igrave;/Yes,</i>&rdquo; before y/n tucks her pencil behind her ear and gets going into the kitchen. It was all he got to see of y/n after breakfast. During the short time the gang was at the hotel, she would go out of her way to not bump into Peter. Flash, when asked about what he&rsquo;d said to her, shrugged and smiled.</p><p>&ldquo;Maybe she realized what a loser you are, Parker.&rdquo;</p><p>He couldn&rsquo;t focus on the picnic his friends planned. His mind kept wandering back to y/n, thinking about what was wrong. What idea had Flash planted in her head? Why had he seen her alone with him, leaving the hotel before his friends had left for the park? Had he done something wrong?</p><p>&ldquo;Peter, hello?&rdquo; MJ punches his arm, to which Peter protests. &ldquo;I said what are you thinking about? Is it aunt May?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&hellip;&rdquo; Peter sighs and nods. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m worried about how she&rsquo;s doing alone. How Queens is doing.&rdquo;</p><p>It was not a lie. He knew aunt May would slap his wrists if she knew he was worrying about her. She wanted him to enjoy his vacation, to take in all the sites and not think about home. He was worried about crime in Queens, in New York really, although that was already taken care of anyways. His Avengers friends were always there, and Spider-Man being gone wouldn&rsquo;t make things too bad. Even then, his aunt had packed his suit &ldquo;just in case&rdquo; he needed it in Italy, which he hadn&rsquo;t.</p><p>Ned pats his friends arm understandingly. &ldquo;Everything back home is fine. Aunt May wouldn&rsquo;t want you thinking about her right now.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay to be homesick, Peter. Especially if you&rsquo;ve never been so far away from everything. But you&rsquo;ve got us, and we are going to make sure you have fun.&rdquo; Betty smiles at him. &ldquo;Come on, let&rsquo;s play with the frisbee I packed.&rdquo;</p><p>After she materializes a pink plastic disk from her backpack everyone spreads out on the field. The warm day was perfect for a game of frisbee, especially because the wind had died down and wouldn&rsquo;t be interfering with the way it flew. A couple classmates who&rsquo;d also decided to go to the park that afternoon joined the game. A few locals who had just been taking a dip in the lake joined them as well, calling for an even bigger space to throw the plastic circle around.</p><p>Once the sun began to set and the sky changed from blue to oranges and reds and pinks, everyone began dispersing and going home. Peter packed up the picnic basket and handed it to Betty, and Ned took her backpack. MJ folded up the blanket, and with that the group was ready to head back to the hotel.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to get us a good table for dinner, I&rsquo;ll see you guys in a bit.&rdquo; Peter says. His friends, thinking nothing of it, head up to their rooms to drop off their things while Peter heads towards the courtyard, where he guessed y/n may be. He was right, but she wasn&rsquo;t alone.</p><p>Flash sat next to her on the bench that y/n and Peter typically sat at to read, and his arm was snaking its way around her shoulders. Peter watches as she goes to shrug him off, only for Flash to pull her closer. He leans into her ear and whispers something, which seems to be the last straw as y/n gets up and pushes his off of her.</p><p>&ldquo;What are you doing to y/n?&rdquo; Peter asks, making his way towards the two. Y/N, surprised, glances at Peter and gives him a thankful look. Flash looks irritated and sighs, standing up.</p><p>&ldquo;What is it to you, Parker? Y/N and I were just getting to know each other.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Looks to me that you were about to leave.&rdquo;</p><p>Flash is taken by surprise by Peter&rsquo;s words directed at him. He did not expect Peter to show up, much less for him to talk to him that way. Flash scoffs and glares at the two of them. Y/N is now standing behind Peter, holding on to his arm. Their classmates were beginning to arrive down for dinner, so Flash gives up for the time being.</p><p>&ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t over, Parker.&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N and Peter watch as Flash heads inside to the eating area, and Peter can feel as y/n relaxes once he&rsquo;s gone. He turns to her and cups her face, studying her to make sure that she is okay.</p><p>&ldquo;Stai bene/Are you okay?&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N nods, smiling up softly at the American boy. &ldquo;<i>lo sono ora/I am now.</i>&nbsp;<i>Thank</i> <i>you</i>.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Perhaps you should go and meet your friends before they wonder what is going on. I will see you after?</i>&rdquo; she asks hopefully. Peter nods, and on a whim, leans down to kiss her forehead. He freezes like that once he realizes what he&rsquo;s done, and y/n giggles. She cups his face and pecks his cheeks. &ldquo;<i>Go</i>.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter goes to one of the empty tables and sits to wait for his friends. His face was still bright red, but thankfully, with the sun setting, it was not that noticeable.</p><p>&ldquo;Sorry for taking so long, Betty and MJ showered and are taking forever to get ready so I just came down.&rdquo; Ned sighs, plopping down on one of the chairs next to Peter. Peter looks up at his friend and nods. &ldquo;Did I miss anything?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I mean, Flash harassing y/n, the girl who works here? Other then that, I guess not.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s the daughter of the owners of the hotel, right?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; Peter nods. &ldquo;The pretty one.&rdquo;</p><p>Although Peter says this in a rather hushes tone, Ned hears it and grins. &ldquo;Do you like her?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Peter is flustered and unsure of what to say. Ned shakes his head and sighs.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay, Peter. It&rsquo;s been forever since Liz, so I think it was only a matter of time before you liked someone else.&rdquo;</p><p>Before Peter could say anything else, Betty and MJ join the boys and the group begins browsing the menu, which offered different things everyday. It helped keep a variation on the foods that the hotel guests could eat, which was great. When y/n makes her way over to take their order, Ned eyes Peter teasingly, which only makes him blush even more. Y/N doesn&rsquo;t really understand what is going on but doesn&rsquo;t ask. Instead, she picks up their menus and tells them that someone will bring up their drinks and food in a minute.</p><p>As planned, Peter waits for y/n after everyone is done with dinner. Most of his classmates had gone down to the game room to play pool and whatnot, while others were either in their room or in the courtyard. Y/N comes out of the kitchen , but today she is not holding her copy of Call Me By Your Name.</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Scusate per il ritardo/Sorry for the delay</i>.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Non ti preoccupare, non mi dispiace/Do not worry, I don&rsquo;t mind.&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N smiles at him, the corners of her eyes wrinkling. She offers her hand, which Peter takes shyly.</p><p>&ldquo;<i>We can go on a walk today? A break from reading.</i>&rdquo; y/n suggests.</p><p>Peter agrees, and the two exit the hotel and walk down the worn sidewalk. The sun has long since gone down, and in its place was a pale, full moon. Crickets chirped from somewhere nearby, and the leaves rustled gently, dancing with the wind. Peter wasn&rsquo;t necessarily sure where y/n was taking him, but he didn&rsquo;t mind. As long as he was with her, he felt at ease, and he hoped she felt the same way. They end up at the park that Peter had been at earlier that day, and the two walk towards the sandy shore of the lake. Warm water rippled from the center of the lake towards the edge, causing the tiniest waves. The moon&rsquo;s reflection lit up the area, lit up y/n&rsquo;s face even, as he turned to look at her.</p><p>She wore a thoughtful look on her face. Her loose hair tumbled down her shoulders, and Peter gave into his urge of tucking some behind her ear. Y/N smiled as she turned to look at him.</p><p>&ldquo;Flash ti ha ferito/Did Flash hurt you?&rdquo; Peter asks quietly.</p><p>&ldquo;<i>No. Ma parliamo di qualcos'altro/No, but let&rsquo;s talk about something else, please?</i>&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Okay.&rdquo;</p><p>The couple sits down close to each other and look out at the water, silent for a moment before y/n talks. She asks about Peter&rsquo;s life in New York, what the states are like and his family and friends. As the two talk, y/n rests her head on his shoulders, curling up closer to the boy. After a moment of hesitation, Peter puts an arm around her, which she holds with her own.</p><p>It had not been the best day, not for y/n, but being here with a boy like Peter, near calming waters talking about each other, she hoped it would mean it would all be okay. At least for tonight. She was glad Peter didn&rsquo;t push her to talk about things she didn&rsquo;t want to. That he cared about her feelings, and above all, he respected her. Peter was what she wanted in a boy.</p><p><i>taglist below the cut</i></p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-</p><p>taglist: </p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mnPe53J7tWm2XHU4k8dMO2Q\"

This meant that on Saturday, everyone slept in until the sun was high up in the sky, shining down on their faces through the sheer curtains of their hotel rooms.</p>\n<p>Ned was the first one to wake up from the two boys, and proceeded to sing loudly as he showered and got ready for the day. Peter groaned, flipping over towards the wall as he pulled the covers over his head. Steam billows out of the restroom when Ned opens the door. He lowers his singing down to humming as he does his hair and slips on his shoes.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Are you not going to come down for breakfast? MJ and Betty are already in the courtyard waiting for us dude.&rdquo; Ned asks. He grabs one of the keycards from the table and glances at Peter, who has now removed the blanket from over his head and is looking at him.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I just need a second. You can go on down though.&rdquo; Ned nods and exits the room, leaving Peter alone to get ready.</p>\n<p>The &nbsp;day was beginning to feel rather warm, which helped Peter in leaning towards wearing some shorts and a light flannel over one of his graphic shirts he&rsquo;d packed. After brushing his teeth and doing his hair, he grabs his copy of the keycard and heads down to the courtyard to join his friends.</p>\n<p>Y/N is standing at the far end gate near the kitchen, watching everyone. She wears a white sundress with tiny red printed roses, and it flutters in the wind. Her hands are cross in front of her, a look of boredom on her face. Peter glances between his friends and y/n, hesitating on who to approach first but goes for the first option. He didn&rsquo;t quite want his little secret that was with y/n to be shown quite yet.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Hey Peter.&rdquo; Betty smiles up happily at her boyfriend&rsquo;s friend, who is settling into his seat. He smiles and looks down at his menu for the breakfast options.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Hey Betty, hi MJ. How are you guys?&rdquo; he asks.</p>\n</p>",

Maybe after.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Please?&rdquo; Peter asked, pouting. &ldquo;Promise I&rsquo;ll leave you alone then.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ugh. Fine,&rdquo; Y/N stood up, tucking a bookmark into her textbook and shutting it. &ldquo;This better be good.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It is.&rdquo; Peter smiled, grabbing her hand and tugging her along.</p><p>Slightly surprised, Y/N let herself be led to&hellip; wherever they were going. They passed tables of people: reading, writing, sleeping. Y/N followed Peter through stacks of books, shelves with cookbooks and mysteries, picture books and science fiction, how-to manuals and physics novels. They finally stopped in a corner full of outdated dictionaries.</p><p>&ldquo;Peter, what is going on?&rdquo; Y/N asked suspiciously, swiping her finger across the shelf and picking up a trail of dust. &ldquo;This corner looks like it hasn&rsquo;t been touched in ages!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Just be quiet, and follow me. We&rsquo;re not there yet.&rdquo; He led her around the corner into a harshly illuminated hallway, a stark contrast from the dusty lighting they had just been in.</p><p>The hallway was relatively short, white doors lining the monotonous white walls. It didn&rsquo;t seem calm and inviting like the rest of the library, but boring and lifeless. Peter walked towards a door near the end of the hallway, a bright yellow DO NOT ENTER- UNDER CONSTRUCTION sign. &ldquo;Peter, are you sure this is where you want to be-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, I&rsquo;m sure. Now come on. They&rsquo;ve stopped construction so no one is up here anymore.&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N followed Peter, who pushed open the door to reveal a long flight of stairs. At the top, a plain door stood inconspicuously. He pushed it open, and they stepped out onto the roof. In one corner stood a small garden full of plants in all shapes and sizes, with a bench situated in the foliage. In another there stood a weather-beaten terrace, obviously not used in many years. The third corner was closed in, much like a porch. Peter headed toward that corner. &ldquo;Wow.&rdquo; Y/N looked around, surprise. &ldquo;Why do they have all of this on the roof of a library?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not quite sure.&rdquo; Peter answered, opening the porch door and walking inside. &ldquo;I think they were planning on making a rooftop garden with books for when the weather was nice like this, but they never finished it. Now I&rsquo;m the only one who ever comes up here, so I take the books that I&rsquo;m reading and put them up here. That way, no one can take them.&rdquo; He ran his thumb along the shelf of books, selecting a rather thick volume and pulling it out. &ldquo;This is one of my favourites.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Les Mis\u00e9rables. I love this one.&rdquo; Y/N smiled as she lifted the book from Peter&rsquo;s hands. She looked up at him, eyes sparkling. &ldquo;How long have you known about this place?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;About a month. It really got more enjoyable once the weather got warmer. Here, follow me.&rdquo; Peter opened up a cabinet in the corner, grabbing a blanket and stuffing it under his arm. They walked out of the covered room into the warm early summer evening. The sun was shooting up it&rsquo;s last rays as it was swallowed in a sea of pinks and yellows. The air was heavy with the sunset, the world preparing to sleep. Peter spread the blanket out on the floor, sitting down and patting the ground next to him. Y/N situated herself next to him, looking up at the sky.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s so beautiful up here. You&rsquo;re really lucky to have found this place,&rdquo; she said, looking at the boy next to her.</p><p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;m even luckier to share it with someone even more beautiful.&rdquo; He smiled, seeing the girl next to him blush. He sighed, gazing up at the picturesque sky above them.</p><p>Y/N grinned, then pressed a kiss to Peter&rsquo;s cheek. He started, then looked down at Y/N playfully. &ldquo;You can do it again, if you&rsquo;d like.&rdquo;</p><p>She laughed, before pushing his curls to one side and brushing her lips against his.\u00a0</p><p>They were surrounded by the fading light, beauty encircling their corner of the world.

They finally stopped in a corner full of outdated dictionaries.</p><p>&ldquo;Peter, what is going on?&rdquo; Y/N asked suspiciously, swiping her finger across the shelf and picking up a trail of dust. &ldquo;This corner looks like it hasn&rsquo;t been touched in ages!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Just be quiet, and follow me. We&rsquo;re not there yet.&rdquo; He led her around the corner into a harshly illuminated hallway, a stark contrast from the dusty lighting they had just been in.</p><p>The hallway was relatively short, white doors lining the monotonous white walls. It didn&rsquo;t seem calm and inviting like the rest of the library, but boring and lifeless. Peter walked towards a door near the end of the hallway, a bright yellow DO NOT ENTER- UNDER CONSTRUCTION sign. &ldquo;Peter, are you sure this is where you want to be-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, I&rsquo;m sure. Now come on. They&rsquo;ve stopped construction so no one is up here anymore.&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N followed Peter, who pushed open the door to reveal a long flight of stairs. At the top, a plain door stood inconspicuously. He pushed it open, and they stepped out onto the roof. In one corner stood a small garden full of plants in all shapes and sizes, with a bench situated in the foliage. In another there stood a weather-beaten terrace, obviously not used in many years. The third corner was closed in, much like a porch. Peter headed toward that corner. &ldquo;Wow.&rdquo; Y/N looked around, surprise. &ldquo;Why do they have all of this on the roof of a library?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not quite sure.&rdquo; Peter answered, opening the porch door and walking inside. &ldquo;I think they were planning on making a rooftop garden with books for when the weather was nice like this, but they never finished it. Now I&rsquo;m the only one who ever comes up here, so I take the books that I&rsquo;m reading and put them up here. That way, no one can take them.&rdquo; He ran his thumb along the shelf of books, selecting a rather thick volume and pulling it out. &ldquo;This is one of my favourites.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Les Mis&eacute;rables. I love this one.&rdquo; Y/N smiled as she lifted the book from Peter&rsquo;s hands. She looked up at him, eyes sparkling. &ldquo;How long have you known about this place?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;About a month. It really got more enjoyable once the weather got warmer. Here, follow me.&rdquo; Peter opened up a cabinet in the corner, grabbing a blanket and stuffing it under his arm. They walked out of the covered room into the warm early summer evening. The sun was shooting up it&rsquo;s last rays as it was swallowed in a sea of pinks and yellows. The air was heavy with the sunset, the world preparing to sleep. Peter spread the blanket out on the floor, sitting down and patting the ground next to him. Y/N situated herself next to him, looking up at the sky.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s so beautiful up here. You&rsquo;re really lucky to have found this place,&rdquo; she said, looking at the boy next to her.</p><p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;m even luckier to share it with someone even more beautiful.&rdquo; He smiled, seeing the girl next to him blush. He sighed, gazing up at the picturesque sky above them.</p><p>Y/N grinned, then pressed a kiss to Peter&rsquo;s cheek. He started, then looked down at Y/N playfully. &ldquo;You can do it again, if you&rsquo;d like.&rdquo;</p><p>She laughed, before pushing his curls to one side and brushing her lips against his.&nbsp;</p><p>They were surrounded by the fading light, beauty encircling their corner of the world. The Sun&rsquo;s last tendrils bade the world goodnight, fireflies blinking to life around them.</p><p>And if they stayed there past midnight to count stars? They were the only ones to know.</p>",

She looked around from where she sat at a table near the back of the library, books and papers spread out around her. Craning her neck, the girl looked around, trying to find the person who so desperately wanted her attention.</p>\n<p>And then she saw him.</p>\n<p>He waved from a table near the nonfiction books. Chair balanced&nbsp; on two legs, leaning up against a bookshelf, an impish grin on his face, messy curls, and a pencil tucked behind his ear. He motioned for her to come over. Smiling slightly, she motioned to her book, then pointed at her obnoxiously long essay she had to write. Rolling his eyes playfully, he got up and made his way over to the table where Y/N was sitting. &ldquo;Geez, Y/N, you really are deaf, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; the boy said, flopping down on a chair next to her.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not deaf, Peter!&rdquo; Y/N whispered indignantly. &ldquo;Plus, I&rsquo;m trying to finish this essay so I don&rsquo;t have all hell break loose on me next Tuesday.&rdquo;</p>\n</p>",
