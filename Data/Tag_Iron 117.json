Strange tries to ignore the smaller man pressed against his arm and said &ldquo; H-How about we go to Olive Garden. Sounds good too you?&rdquo; Tony looked up and smiled &ldquo;Sounds great&rdquo; he said. Olive Garden was a couple blocks away  from where they were and they decided to walk. When the streets began to get crowded, strange had to put his arm around tony&rsquo;s hip. He told Tony that he rather be closer to him than to a stranger and besides the cape was pulling them impossibly closer to each other. Tony only smiled as strange rambled his face red as an apple. They continued like that until they reached their destination. They got a booth in the corner where no one could really see them.

Without thinking, strange placed his hand on tony&rsquo;s mouth and told his cape that if he didn&rsquo;t stop he was gonna cut him into little pieces. The cape stopped moving but didn&rsquo;t move from Stark. Strange ripped his hand away from Starks mouth and apologize  he just didn&rsquo;t want to cause a scene. He  looked at Tony and saw that he was drooling a little and panting. Strange looked around the restraunt and saw no-one was paying them any attention.</p><p>When their food finally came Tony had settled down but moved closer to strange.

When happy arrived they got in and headed to the tower. Tony had scooted over to strange and placed his hand on his thigh. Strange cleared his throat and tried to will his body to calm down,but when stark kissed him he couldn&rsquo;t hold back. The cape decided to lay itself on the other side of the limos seats away from Tony and strange. Neither men realized nor did they care;  all they cared about was touching every inch they could of each other and their tongues battling for dominance.</p><p>When they arrived at the tower strange opens a portable to Starks room and picks Tony up and carries him through the portal. When the portal closes, happy stood there stunned at what he saw.  Strange laid Tony down on the bed and kissed down his neck. Tony tugged at strange&rsquo;s  shirt and strange took his and Tony shirts and pants off while kissing him in between.  Strange licked an sucked at tony&rsquo;s nipples which made Tony moan. He slowly went lower kissing and sucking as he went. Tony whimpered and tugged at strange&rsquo;s hair.  Strange only hummed in approval and kissed the tip of tony&rsquo;s penis. Then placed him in his mouth; Tony threw his head back at the sensation and moaned. The feeling of strange&rsquo;s hot, wet mouth surrounding his length and the sight of him bobbing his head made Tony melt from pleasure. Strange pulled off with a pop which made Tony whimpered at the loss but soon grabbed the covers when strange began to poke his tongue in his tight hole. Tony was a moaning, skwrimming mess it was music to strange&rsquo;s ears. </p><p>He put in one finger in and Tony wiggled around at the new feeling. Then he began to pump his finger then added another and another and soon Tony was begging strange to put it in. Strange lubed up his penis and slowly began to enter Tony. He kissed and suck at his neck while Tony groaned from the pain and pleasure he felt. When he was fully inside, he moaned at the feeling of being sucked in deeper by Tony. &ldquo;Mmm ah Tony you&rsquo;re so tight.&rdquo; He dipped down and kissed him. &ldquo;Move strange I can&rsquo;t take it anymor- AH! strange moved at a fast rhythm and Tony locked his legs around him throwing his head back into the pillows.

Without thinking again, strange said he could have carried stark if his feet was hurting. Tony whipped out his phone to call happy,but strange snatched the phone and said he was just kidding. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t sound like you was kidding to me.&rdquo; Tony murmured. When happy arrived they got in and headed to the tower. Tony had scooted over to strange and placed his hand on his thigh. Strange cleared his throat and tried to will his body to calm down,but when stark kissed him he couldn&rsquo;t hold back. The cape decided to lay itself on the other side of the limos seats away from Tony and strange. Neither men realized nor did they care;  all they cared about was touching every inch they could of each other and their tongues battling for dominance.</p><p>When they arrived at the tower strange opens a portable to Starks room and picks Tony up and carries him through the portal. When the portal closes, happy stood there stunned at what he saw.  Strange laid Tony down on the bed and kissed down his neck. Tony tugged at strange&rsquo;s  shirt and strange took his and Tony shirts and pants off while kissing him in between.  Strange licked an sucked at tony&rsquo;s nipples which made Tony moan. He slowly went lower kissing and sucking as he went. Tony whimpered and tugged at strange&rsquo;s hair.  Strange only hummed in approval and kissed the tip of tony&rsquo;s penis. Then placed him in his mouth; Tony threw his head back at the sensation and moaned. The feeling of strange&rsquo;s hot, wet mouth surrounding his length and the sight of him bobbing his head made Tony melt from pleasure. Strange pulled off with a pop which made Tony whimpered at the loss but soon grabbed the covers when strange began to poke his tongue in his tight hole. Tony was a moaning, skwrimming mess it was music to strange&rsquo;s ears. </p><p>He put in one finger in and Tony wiggled around at the new feeling. Then he began to pump his finger then added another and another and soon Tony was begging strange to put it in. Strange lubed up his penis and slowly began to enter Tony. He kissed and suck at his neck while Tony groaned from the pain and pleasure he felt. When he was fully inside, he moaned at the feeling of being sucked in deeper by Tony. &ldquo;Mmm ah Tony you&rsquo;re so tight.&rdquo; He dipped down and kissed him. &ldquo;Move strange I can&rsquo;t take it anymor- AH! strange moved at a fast rhythm and Tony locked his legs around him throwing his head back into the pillows. The room spinned and Tony  dugged his nails into strange&rsquo;s back. \"Ah! Tony I&rsquo;m about to cum.&rdquo; &ldquo;Mmm fuck give it to me. Fill me up baby.&rdquo; Strange pumped tony&rsquo;s dick and Tony screamed &ldquo;Ah! i can&rsquo;t hold on much longer-AH AH YES YES Mhmm.&rdquo;</p><p> Strange came with a shout filling every inch of Tony. Tony eyes rolled to the back of his head as he reached his climax  and spilled his load on his and strange&rsquo;s stomach. Strange pumped Tony slowly guiding him down from his climax. He pulled out and went to the bathroom to get a warm towel to wipe the cum off him and tony&rsquo;s stomach. He then threw the towel on the floor and climbed  back in bed with Tony. </p><p>They laid there panting looking at the ceiling. Tony places his head on strange&rsquo;s chest &ldquo; You should slap my ass more often if this is the end result.&rdquo; Strange chuckled &ldquo; I&rsquo;ll keep that in mind.&rdquo; He kisses Tony on the head and they began to fall asleep.</p><p>(Picture: from Pinterest.

Naturally, they stared each other down.</p><p>Although\n one of them, the shorter one, also looked the taller one over, as if \nchecking him out - not that the taller one cared about this, of course.</p><p>The\n young barista behind the counter who wore a nameplate saying &ldquo;Thomas&rdquo; \ntook the cups from the patrons&rsquo; hands and inspected the contents.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh\n no,&rdquo; he said with the appropriate apologetic tone. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m really sorry, \nDr. Strange. And, uh&hellip;&rdquo; He glanced at the name on one of the cups he \nwas holding. &ldquo;&hellip;Tony. Looks like the new kid got your orders mixed up. \nI&rsquo;ll make you a new batch right away.&rdquo; He turned around and got to work \nimmediately.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, Thomas, mind making mine first?&rdquo; Tony called \nloudly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just a double-shot black and I have a meeting, so \nactually, just make it to go. Chop-chop!&rdquo;</p><p>He clapped his hands. Taller guy visibly bristled and glared at him.</p><p>&ldquo;Really? You just -&rdquo; He clapped his hands mockingly. &ldquo;- and things magically happen for you, huh?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well,\n usually, people get my order right the first time,&rdquo; Tony answered \nquickly. &ldquo;So I don&rsquo;t have to - &rdquo; And clapped his hands again, closer to \ntaller guy&rsquo;s face this time. &ldquo;The magic happens all by itself.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/17988824\">Read the rest on AO3</a><br /></p>",
