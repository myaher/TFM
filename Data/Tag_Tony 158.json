My hands trembling at my\nsides and the bed feels unnaturally cold. I open my eyes and\u2026 darkness. My hand\nfalls on her side of the bed, the only thing on my mind being her warmth. I\nneed to feel her. But\u2026 she\u2019s not there. I want to keep my cool. I want to just\ngo back to sleep and forget the nightmares. But\u2026 she\u2019s not there. My breathing\nquickens and my eyes dash from one side of the room to the other, wondering\nwhere the hell she is.</p><p>Then, the door opens. A single ray of light and her. That\u2019s\nall I need to calm down. That\u2019s all I need for my breathing to turn back to\nnormal and for my heart to stop stuttering. She\u2019s here. She\u2019s safe.</p><p>\u201cTony, why\u2019re you awake?\u201d she asks, her voice lower than a\nwhisper.</p><p>\u201cNightmare,\u201d I answer and she smiles sadly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I had to go pee.\u201d She giggles and shifts to lay\nback down in bed. I hum in acknowledgement and for a second, it seems like\nshe\u2019s wondering whether it\u2019d be better to touch me or not.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019re you waiting for? Come here.\u201d I open my arms and she\nsnuggles right in.</p><!-- more --><p>Our room is quiet. It\u2019s peaceful. It feels like heaven. But\nnot because of the soft bedsheets or the aromatic smells coming from the\ndiffuser. No. In the dark, it\u2019s her touch that feels like a little piece of\nheaven. A piece of heaven that is only mine. Warm. Cozy. Her warm breath making\nme shiver in pleasure. Her fingers drawing patterns on my chest, moving down\ntowards my sides\u2026</p><p>My eyes grow wide. Oh god.</p><p>Her fingers dive for the kill, skillfully moving against my\nribcage as a high-pitched yelp leaves my lips and I jump up and&hellip; off the bed.\nShe smirks. Oh god, she\u2019s going to be the death of me.</p><p>\u201cNow, Y/N, honey\u2026\u201d My hands are in front of me as I stand\nup, as if trying to tame a dangerous animal.

But in my defense, most people don\u2019t know Y/N. Sure, she might be a\ngreat girlfriend and a great lover but she has one flaw\u2026 She\u2019s an absolute\ntickle freak.

I don\u2019t do kids or babies or toddlers, no-one under age ten,\u201d they were all annoying and loud and <em>messy</em> and he was wearing Tom Ford, (most of them) were idiots who had no sense of the value of clothes (and small and breakable and very easily impressionable, he was <em>not </em>a good guy for kids to be around). And he didn\u2019t want to be responsible for his boyfriend\u2019s demise as a baby as a result of his terrible life-skills.</p>\n\n<p>Natasha rolled her eyes, \u201cFor god\u2019s sake Stark, take him, he clearly remembers you, he was crying until someone mentioned you and refused to leave Thor before now.

Pepper rubbed his arm, making sure he didn\u2019t just book it. </p><!-- more --><p>They were in a dog shelter, and while Tony usually followed his \u2018no pets\u2019 rule, Pepper had mentioned there was a dog here that was already trained to be a service dog for people suffering with PTSD- something Tony had. Tony only allowed her to actually come here to check the dog out, when she mentioned the dog was there and not working because it\u2019s previous owner\u2019s partner beat the dog.</p><p>\u201cAlright, here she is!\u201d One of the assistants announced, gently tugging on the leash so the dog would come in. Tony frowned at the sight of the dog literally shaking in fear, crouching and her tail tucked under her. \u201cCome on, it\u2019s okay!\u201d The woman called. </p><p>\u201cHey there.\u201d Tony slid off his seat, kneeling on the floor and offering his hand. The dog, was clearly interested, but daren\u2019t get close. </p><p>\u201cSorry, she\u2019s really skittish around new people.\u201d The woman explained. Tony just kept his eyes focussed on the dog in front of him, who had plopped onto the floor, but was very slowly using her paws to shuffle forward, till her nose booped the tip of his fingers. In response to that, Tony gently moved to pet her chin, moving behind her ear. While it was clear she was still scared, she relaxed a little and leant into the petting. </p><p>\u201cHer tail\u2019s wagging.\u201d Pepper whispered. </p><p>\u201cWow\u2026 you\u2019re special, she hasn\u2019t done that since she\u2019s been here.\u201d The woman responded. Tony smiled, now introducing his other hand so he could pet both ears, and he watched as the dog\u2019s face slowly showed some content and calmness. </p><p>\u201cGuess it\u2019s a sign. I can adopt her, right?\u201d Tony asked. </p><p>It was slow progress. He kept his dog mostly on the main floor of the tower, only leaving when she wanted or needed a walk. He quickly realised her boundaries. You were petrified of most of the avengers- notably the men, and she could only just stand being around Wanda and Natasha. Pepper \u00a0did a little better with her with since she\u2019d known her longer, but she only acted more like an actual dog around Tony. She only wagged her tail when Tony came in the room or he called her name. The name was probably the hardest thing for Tony. He wanted something that would suit her and would also not make him feel silly for calling when out in public. It made it especially hard since she was barely showing her personality, so she ended up getting named two weeks later, as simply Baby. He chose it since he found himself calling her that often anyway.</p><p>Tony really got to see Baby shine when they were in a calm situation, and it was just them and Pepper, and the other time was when his PTSD unfortunately kicked in. Baby had realised Tony needed her help, so no matter how shy or scared she was of people, if Tony needed her, then she\u2019d be a service dog and not just a companion. She\u2019s rest her head on his lap, or put her paws up on him, or lick him, and just do everything she could to get his attention and to distract him. She was a great service dog, proven by the fact that since getting her, his breakdowns had become extraordinarily rare. </p><p>That made Tony feel like he had to return to favour to his dog. </p><p>He heard her whimpering during the night, enough to wake him up. He sat up, looking down at the dog that was still asleep, curled at his feet. He knew what was going on. He wasn\u2019t an idiot, he knew dogs could have nightmares as well. She was kicking his legs as well, clearly trying to run, and he gently moved to get closer to her, and rested his hand on her back rubbing it. </p><p>The dog jolted, letting out a yelp, clearly confused at her surroundings, calming quickly though when she heard Tony cooing at her. \u201cIt\u2019s alright Baby, I\u2019m here.\u201d He told her. The dog still whimpered, mimicking the same behaviour he\u2019d seen when he adopted her. Shaking, tail between her legs. However, this time, she stood, and carefully moved closer to her owner, and just pressed herself against his chest. He hugged the dog, knowing she was now the one seeking reassurance. \u201cGood girl. It\u2019s okay.\u201d He spoke softly, just cuddling her. </p><hr><p>Hope you like it!

Pepper rubbed his arm, making sure he didn\u2019t just book it. </p>[[MORE]]<p>They were in a dog shelter, and while Tony usually followed his \u2018no pets\u2019 rule, Pepper had mentioned there was a dog here that was already trained to be a service dog for people suffering with PTSD- something Tony had. Tony only allowed her to actually come here to check the dog out, when she mentioned the dog was there and not working because it\u2019s previous owner\u2019s partner beat the dog.</p><p>\u201cAlright, here she is!\u201d One of the assistants announced, gently tugging on the leash so the dog would come in. Tony frowned at the sight of the dog literally shaking in fear, crouching and her tail tucked under her. \u201cCome on, it\u2019s okay!\u201d The woman called. </p><p>\u201cHey there.\u201d Tony slid off his seat, kneeling on the floor and offering his hand. The dog, was clearly interested, but daren\u2019t get close. </p><p>\u201cSorry, she\u2019s really skittish around new people.\u201d The woman explained. Tony just kept his eyes focussed on the dog in front of him, who had plopped onto the floor, but was very slowly using her paws to shuffle forward, till her nose booped the tip of his fingers. In response to that, Tony gently moved to pet her chin, moving behind her ear. While it was clear she was still scared, she relaxed a little and leant into the petting. </p><p>\u201cHer tail\u2019s wagging.\u201d Pepper whispered. </p><p>\u201cWow\u2026 you\u2019re special, she hasn\u2019t done that since she\u2019s been here.\u201d The woman responded. Tony smiled, now introducing his other hand so he could pet both ears, and he watched as the dog\u2019s face slowly showed some content and calmness. </p><p>\u201cGuess it\u2019s a sign. I can adopt her, right?\u201d Tony asked. </p><p>It was slow progress. He kept his dog mostly on the main floor of the tower, only leaving when she wanted or needed a walk. He quickly realised her boundaries. You were petrified of most of the avengers- notably the men, and she could only just stand being around Wanda and Natasha. Pepper \u00a0did a little better with her with since she\u2019d known her longer, but she only acted more like an actual dog around Tony. She only wagged her tail when Tony came in the room or he called her name. The name was probably the hardest thing for Tony. He wanted something that would suit her and would also not make him feel silly for calling when out in public. It made it especially hard since she was barely showing her personality, so she ended up getting named two weeks later, as simply Baby. He chose it since he found himself calling her that often anyway.</p><p>Tony really got to see Baby shine when they were in a calm situation, and it was just them and Pepper, and the other time was when his PTSD unfortunately kicked in. Baby had realised Tony needed her help, so no matter how shy or scared she was of people, if Tony needed her, then she\u2019d be a service dog and not just a companion. She\u2019s rest her head on his lap, or put her paws up on him, or lick him, and just do everything she could to get his attention and to distract him. She was a great service dog, proven by the fact that since getting her, his breakdowns had become extraordinarily rare. </p><p>That made Tony feel like he had to return to favour to his dog. </p><p>He heard her whimpering during the night, enough to wake him up. He sat up, looking down at the dog that was still asleep, curled at his feet. He knew what was going on. He wasn\u2019t an idiot, he knew dogs could have nightmares as well. She was kicking his legs as well, clearly trying to run, and he gently moved to get closer to her, and rested his hand on her back rubbing it. </p><p>The dog jolted, letting out a yelp, clearly confused at her surroundings, calming quickly though when she heard Tony cooing at her. \u201cIt\u2019s alright Baby, I\u2019m here.\u201d He told her. The dog still whimpered, mimicking the same behaviour he\u2019d seen when he adopted her. Shaking, tail between her legs. However, this time, she stood, and carefully moved closer to her owner, and just pressed herself against his chest. He hugged the dog, knowing she was now the one seeking reassurance. \u201cGood girl. It\u2019s okay.\u201d He spoke softly, just cuddling her. </p><hr><p>Hope you like it!
