It\u2019s just\u2026on his mind. Sometimes.<br/></p><p>Things are perfectly fine, really. Everything\u2019s great. Lucas\u2019s mom picks up the phone when he calls again and again, after two days of silence, and assures him she\u2019s okay. Her voice sounds airy through the speaker, and flimsy in a way voices sometimes sound, almost as if stretched thin, but Lucas doesn\u2019t know if it\u2019s because of something serious going on with her health or if it\u2019s just a shitty connection\u2019s fault, and the fact that he can\u2019t tell makes guilt coil in his stomach. His dad sends him money, miraculously. It\u2019s less than usual, and the notification he receives when he gets the transfer leaves him disgruntled and tense, even when he tries to push the feelings down, even when he tells himself he should be grateful for however small the amount of money sent his way is. It\u2019s not high school anymore. He has a job. He can get by.</p><p>So he gets by.</p><p>As for Eliott, they go out for coffee on Wednesday and hang around campus during when they both have a free period on Friday, as they usually do, and it\u2019s okay. Lucas good-naturedly insults Eliott\u2019s disgustingly sweet coffee that he orders and Eliott makes fun of the way Lucas grimaces when he takes the first sip of his own americano. He calls it pretentious. His smile is wide.</p><p>\u201dYou are the art student here,\u201d Lucas tells him, taking another sip. It burns his tongue a little. \u201dHow am I pretentious if you\u2019re the one walking around with a joint tucked behind your ear?\u201d</p><p>Eliott only rakes his hand through Lucas\u2019s hair in an attempt to jokingly shove him away, without any real force behind it. He laughs, \u201dYeah, whatever you say,\u201d and misses the glance Lucas shoots him as he fixes the mess on his head.</p><p>On Friday, they go and lay down on the grass in front of the Social Sciences building, amongst dozens of other students, and Eliott tells him about his new art project he\u2019s starting to work on for one of the classes and then plays a <i>\u201dwhat does this cloud remind you of\u201d</i> game\u2014with himself, mostly, because his ideas are so ridiculous that Lucas is, half the time, laughing too hard to even form a decent answer.</p><p>It\u2019s good.</p><!-- more --><p>Eliott seems better, too, slightly. His eyes look less empty, and the glint in them is back, even if still significantly dulled. He holds himself straighter, walks around with a bounce in his step. Lucas doesn\u2019t dare to ask if it was his genius idea of a rebound that made Eliott feel better or if it was something else completely. He\u2019s not sure he wants to know.</p><p>And if he looks at Eliott\u2019s fingers curled around his paper cup a bit too long, as they leave the coffee shop, nobody has to know. Nobody has to know about how his eyes catch on Eliott\u2019s lips when he smiles in the afternoon sun, either, or about how Lucas thinks, <i>it happened. It happened. What the hell.</i></p><p>The thoughts are less nagging though, with each passing day. They\u2019re fine. They\u2019re friends. Eliott is fun to tease, fun to hang around with, fun to talk to. They might have slept together, but it was just once and they were both drunk and emotionally exhausted, and whatever happened between them was\u2014 it felt good, okay, but it was a one-time thing. Eliott had clearly pushed it out of his mind as soon as it happened. Lucas just needs to find a way to do the same. They\u2019re friends, just like they have been for the past few months, and if Lucas has to somehow deal with this weird mixture of relief and confusion he\u2019s feeling now, it\u2019s his own business. It\u2019s like nothing ever happened.</p><p>*</p><p>That is, until it happens again.</p><p>*</p><p><br/>Lucas walks right into it. He can admit that, alright.</p><p>In his defence, when Eliott says he has some weed he wouldn\u2019t mind sharing as they\u2019re walking to the bus stop near the campus, Lucas thinks nothing of it. It\u2019s all good. They\u2019ve done this many times before. Eliott is sporting his casual <i>\u201dI\u2019m cool and tall and chill\u201d</i> vibe, shoulders slightly hunched, and it makes Lucas relax, too. It\u2019s very easy, he\u2019s discovered, to relax around Eliott.</p><p>So he says, \u201dYeah, sure,\u201d and shrugs, adding, \u201dfree weed doesn\u2019t hurt.\u201d</p><p>Eliott smiles in response. \u201dIt sure doesn\u2019t,\u201d is his answer, and that\u2019s that.</p><p>By this point, the memory of what happened between them feels more like something Lucas, for some reason, imagined than an actual thing that took place. It\u2019s been over 2 weeks. Lucas has been trying not to think about it, and can proudly announce that he\u2019s been mostly successful. There is an occasional shiver running through his body when Eliott does something and it catches him off guard, but it\u2019s stupid and Lucas just brushes it off as insignificant. <i>We\u2019re both back to normal</i>, he thinks.</p><p>It\u2019s his first mistake.</p><p>At Eliott\u2019s place, they kick their shoes off and hang their jackets by the front door and then Eliott goes to the kitchen to see if he has something in the fridge that they could actually eat while Lucas hangs around the living room. There\u2019s a new drawing pinned to the wall by the window, and Lucas looks at it for a while but for the life of him can\u2019t figure out what it\u2019s supposed to mean because it looks like modern art, something obscure and messy, a collage of sharp lines and dark colours, and he\u2019s not good with that. Eliott\u2019s the artist here.</p><p>He likes Eliott\u2019s art. Used to make fun of it, teasingly, at first, but quickly stopped when he realised how protective Eliott was of it, and how a stupid joke could make him feel bad when that wasn\u2019t Lucas\u2019s intention at all. He looks at the little art show on Eliott\u2019s wall pretty much whenever he comes over, notices when the drawings change or when Eliott tapes some new ones next to the ones Lucas already knows. Sometimes, when he looks at them, it\u2019s only in awe. Sometimes, it\u2019s in a strange, curled-in-his-chest onset of irrational jealousy.</p><p>He wishes, sometimes, that he had an outlet similar to how Eliott has his art. Something he could lose himself in when he doesn\u2019t want to think too much. Something he could create. Wonders what that\u2019s like, to make something out of nothing and have enough courage to show it to the world.</p><p>And then Eliott walks into the room and the moment passes and Lucas snaps out of it.</p><p>The time lingers, after that, but in a nice way. They smoke a bit, hang around and laugh and talk. Eliott puts on some music at one point and then pretends to get offended when Lucas says that dubstep is awful and asks him to turn it off, with a grin. Eliott turns the volume up instead and smirks. Lucas throws a pillow at him and misses, and then barely has time to react when Eliott picks it off the floor and flings right back in his direction as he comes back to the couch. It hits Lucas square in the face and he makes a high-pitched sound that causes Eliott to burst into laughter.</p><p>Lucas tries to hide his own responding smile under a frown but fails. \u201dIt\u2019s great that you\u2019re having so much fun mistreating me,\u201d he mutters, notes of amusement seeping into the sentence. Eliott shrugs, still grinning.</p><p>\u201dYou started it,\u201d he says, chuckles again and then picks up his half-smoked joint from where he\u2019s left it in the ashtray, takes a drag. Lucas watches the smoke when he breathes out, looks at it dissipate and disappear into the air between them. He can feel the atmosphere changing, shifting into something else.</p><p>Then, he says, \u201dyou\u2019re doing better.\u201d</p><p>It just slips out, before Lucas thinks about it, a statement but also not really. It\u2019s easy to say when Eliott looks the way he does, smiling wide like he never stopped, relaxed and joking around. It looks good on him.</p><p>Eliott turns to send him a glance and his eyes are bright. \u201dAm I?\u201d</p><p>\u201dAren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>It settles between them. Eliott takes another drag of his joint instead of an answer, and Lucas watches the smoke dissolve again, thin, then thinner until it\u2019s gone, and then, when he looks at Eliott again, Eliott is already looking back at him.</p><p>It goes downhill from there.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t know who kisses who first, this time around. He only knows that when it happens, he feels it all the way to his fingertips, the hard press of lips against lips, the heat. Lucas thinks, in a split second, that it\u2019s different now when he\u2019s sober; makes his breath catch. Eliott\u2019s hands are on his jaw, then in his hair, and Lucas feels the grip of his fingers tighten when he opens his mouth to let Eliott deepen the kiss. He curls his fingers into Eliott\u2019s t-shirt, feels Eliott bite on his bottom lip and tug on it gently, then lick into Lucas\u2019s mouth again and it\u2019s ridiculous, ridiculous how it sends a shiver down his spine. He presses himself closer, huffs a breath out when Eliott angles his head and presses Lucas firmer into the couch, push and pull, like a tide.</p><p>It\u2019s so easy, how Eliott grips his waist and how Lucas lets himself get manoeuvred into Eliott\u2019s lap and how they keep kissing like this, too, deep, searing kisses that make the air in the room heat up within moments.</p><p>\u201dFuck,\u201d Eliott utters when they part, under his breath, \u201dFuck, Lucas.\u201d</p><p>\u201dYeah,\u201d he manages and then kisses Eliott again, more of an instinct than choice because it feels <i>good</i> and he\u2019s not really high on the weed but feels a little bit high on <i>this</i>, already, and fuck, <i>fuck</i>. Here goes \u201dback to normal\u201d.</p><p>Eliott is solid underneath him where he shifts and presses a thigh between Lucas\u2019s legs, strong where he grips his waist with one hand while his other slides to Lucas\u2019s hip and settles there, heavy. Lucas lets go of Eliott\u2019s shirt and moves up, up his chest and up his neck and up into his hair, rakes his fingers through it, grips and angles Eliott\u2019s head where he wants it, then shivers when it makes Eliott\u2019s breath catch against his own lips.</p><p>It\u2019s dizzying. Lucas\u2019s head swims.</p><p>He presses his hips down, experimentally, an instinct again, because <i>fuck</i>, he\u2019s half-hard already just from kissing, just from this, then repeats the motion when it makes Eliott gasp. Lucas feels like he rarely feels \u2014 in control of what he does but also a bit unsettled, shifting like liquid. He grinds down again, and then Eliott drags him forward in his lap with the hand heavy on Lucas\u2019s hip and it creates the kind of pressure that makes Lucas break the kiss and curl in on himself with a swallowed down moan.</p><p>Eliott leaves a trail of kisses down the line of Lucas\u2019s jaw, hot and open-mouthed, then mutters into his skin, \u201dCan I\u2014 move you a little, just\u2014\u201d and Lucas is nodding before he knows it, slides his fingers through Eliott\u2019s hair again.</p><p>Eliott moves his hands down to Lucas\u2019s ass as he moves his mouth down, down to Lucas\u2019s neck, pushes them even closer together, firm and solid and Lucas feels, acutely, though four layers of fabric that separate them, how hard they both are. <i>Jesus</i>, he thinks. <i>Jesus fuck</i>.</p><p>He starts moving his hips in little circles, seeking friction, helpless when another stifled moan escapes him.</p><p>\u201dFuck, Lucas,\u201d he registers Eliott saying, emphasising each word with a scrape of teeth at the base of Lucas\u2019s neck like punctuation marks. Lucas angles his head, tries to give him more room. \u201dThat\u2019s so hot\u2014\u201d</p><p><i>What\u2019s hot</i>, he wants to say, but only another breathless sound comes out. He thinks, faintly, <i>what are we doing</i>, but it\u2019s barely there and gone when Eliott thrusts his hips up a little and Lucas falls forward a bit, wraps an arm around Eliott\u2019s neck. Maybe he is high, after all. He doesn\u2019t know. It\u2019s difficult to tell, at this point, when Eliott is underneath him like this, running warm, biting scalding kisses into Lucas\u2019s neck and toying with the waistband of Lucas\u2019s jeans where his shirt has ridden up.</p><p>\u201dEliott,\u201d he says into Eliott\u2019s hair, eyes closed. He knows he\u2019s flushed. He feels hot and liquid and heavy, like molasses. He grinds down again, sharper; it makes the heat build up, up. \u201dPlease, touch me.\u201d</p><p>And Eliott groans, \u201dOh, God,\u201d and then, \u201dOkay,\u201d and then, as if the words flipped some kind of switch from slow and testing to fast and hurried, his fingers are scrabbling at Lucas\u2019s fly and then he\u2019s shoving Lucas\u2019s pants down his hips, just a little, and then his hand is sneaking under Lucas\u2019s underwear and \u2014</p><p>Eliott wraps his fingers around him and Lucas moans where his lips are pressed against Eliott\u2019s temple, a high-pitched, breathy whine, followed by a series of equally whimpery, punched out <i>oh, oh</i> sounds when Eliott starts to move his hand, flicks his wrist in sharp motions that make Lucas hold on to him tighter and move his hips involuntarily. Lucas should be embarrassed, maybe, about the sounds he\u2019s making, or about how he\u2019s not going to last very long like this, with Eliott\u2019s fingers wrapped around him firmly. He doesn\u2019t really care at the moment.</p><p>He pushes a hand under Eliott\u2019s shirt, slides his palm over his ribs, doesn\u2019t know if the rapid pulse he\u2019s feeling is his own or not.</p><p>Eliott&rsquo;s hand keeps moving. Lucas loses track of time just a little bit. Everything narrows down to Eliott&rsquo;s touch, the heat of it building up low in Lucas&rsquo;s stomach, more and more with each stroke. He pushes into it, helpless, not even sure if he&rsquo;s making noise anymore, curled in on himself, lips pressed to Eliott&rsquo;s temple, then into his hair. Eliott&rsquo;s grip on him loosens, then tightens again, in a rhythm that makes Lucas dizzy, and it&rsquo;s good, it&rsquo;s very good. It&rsquo;s so fucking good, like this.</p><p>\u201dLucas, can I\u2014\u201d Eliott starts again, and Lucas is out of focus enough, out of it enough that he misses whatever Eliott gasps out next, only registers a fumbling gesture he makes between them and how his cheeks are flushed just slightly and then he\u2019s nodding, not sure what he\u2019s agreeing to, but barely caring anyway, hell, he just wants Eliott to keep it going, keep moving, keep making him feel like\u2014</p><p>And then Eliott\u2019s unzipping his own pants, unsteady and scuffling, and then he\u2019s shoving his own boxers down and he\u2019s shifting, pushes Lucas\u2019s hips down, down just a little, and then wraps his hand around both of them, hard and sliding together and Lucas crumples forward, thrusting into it, lightheaded and breathless and hot all over.</p><p>Eliott doesn\u2019t waste time after that, keeps the flicks of his wrist quick and sharp, moves his hips slightly to create even more friction when he can, leans in and Lucas feels his tongue and teeth at the base of his neck, and that\u2019s how he comes, a short while later, thrusting into the touch, gasping against Eliott\u2019s temple, shuddery and helpless, nails biting into Eliott\u2019s scalp.</p><p>When he finishes, following closely, Eliott drags him down into a messy kiss and Lucas lets himself be shifted and moved, a little out of breath, head swimming, loose on his shoulders.</p><p>*</p><p>It takes him a good couple of minutes to come back to himself and he spends them with his eyes closed, face turned down, while Eliott tries to catch his breath under him as well. The fog in his mind disperses, slowly but surely. Lucas sorts himself out with trembling hands, zips his jeans back up and can feel Eliott\u2019s eyes on him as he does.</p><p>When Lucas looks at him, the first thing Eliott says is, \u201dFuck.\u201d</p><p>His eyes are dark. His hair is a mess, and his lips are red from kissing. Lucas thinks, <i>I did that</i>.</p><p>He says, \u201dYeah,\u201d more of an exhale than anything else, then closes his eyes again. \u201dYeah, I know.\u201d</p><p>They roll away from each other, Lucas scrambling off of Eliott\u2019s lap, Eliott sinking a little further into the couch, heavy. Lucas keeps his eyes on the ceiling, then, looks at the shadows there, watches them move as the sunlight flicks into the room and then disappears again after a while. He can hear his own breathing and the blood rushing in his head, whispering like the sea. He waits for the storm to die down.</p><p>Then, he says, \u201dEliott,\u201d and when the boy looks at him, Lucas asks, still a little out of it, \u201dIs this going to keep happening?\u201d</p><p>Eliott blinks, then licks his lips, unsure at once. Lucas tries not to follow the movement too closely. \u201dI\u2014I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>And yeah. Lucas doesn\u2019t, either.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t think he could deal with another round of <i>they don\u2019t acknowledge it\u2014it drives Lucas crazy\u2014things go back to normal\u2014it happens again</i>, but at the same time, he\u2019s not sure what kind of answer he\u2019s expecting to get. If he\u2019s expecting an answer at all. Because okay, they could ignore one drunk excess late at night, in those hours when things are easier to write off as something else than they really are. But this? It\u2019s broad daylight; they\u2019re barely high. Whatever state of \u201dback to normal\u201d they managed to establish since that first time, it went crashing down the second Lucas let Eliott drag him into his lap and lick into his mouth.</p><p>\u201dWould you like for it to?\u201d</p><p>Lucas turns his head so fast his vision swims for a second, almost sure he\u2019s misheard something. But no \u2014 Eliott is looking at him expectantly from the other side of the couch, if a little sheepishly still. He seems unsettled, hesitant when he stretches his arms over the back of the couch, as if in an odd attempt to diffuse the strange atmosphere between them.</p><p>\u201dWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201dWould you,\u201d Eliott repeats, the licks his lips nervously again, \u201dwant it to happen again?\u201d</p><p>Lucas has heard the question the first time around, but it doesn\u2019t change the fact that when Eliott repeats it, his thought process sort of just screeches to a halt.</p><p>\u201dI mean\u2014I don\u2019t\u2014,\u201d he starts and then gets stuck, almost tripping over the words only to finish lamely, \u201d\u2014know.\u201d</p><p>Eliott takes a deep breath and sinks into the couch even more. Neither of them says anything for a moment. Lucas\u2019s mind keeps circling back to the question but can\u2019t come up with a decent answer, anything substantial. He fights the urge to bury his face in his hands.</p><p>Then, Eliott says, quietly, \u201dIt feels good. With you.\u201d</p><p>It catches Lucas off guard \u2014 enough for him to turn and look at Eliott fully, temporarily swallowing down how uncomfortable he feels. Eliott has tilted his head back and closed his eyes, and he\u2019s biting at his lip like he\u2019s not aware that he\u2019s doing it at all. He looks good, with the sun illuminating his profile where it\u2019s coming in through the window. Lucas wonders, stupidly, how come he\u2019d never realised just how ridiculously attractive Eliott really is until they slept together.</p><p>\u201dI don\u2019t know what it is about you, but\u2014\u201d Eliott goes on, but then stops abruptly like he\u2019s struggling with what he wants to say.</p><p>Lucas keeps looking at him. There&rsquo;s a weird kind of bravery sprouting shyly in his chest now, after Eliott\u2019s words. On a whim, he blurts out, \u201dI\u2019m a good rebound, then.\u201d</p><p>It comes out like a joke, but also not really. He watches a slight frown form between Eliott\u2019s eyebrows, and then the boy turns his head and finally peer at him. \u201dDon\u2019t talk about yourself like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201dWell, it\u2019s true. That\u2019s fine,\u201d Lucas shrugs before Eliott can say anything else, because really \u2014 it\u2019s not a big deal. Not <i>that</i> big, anyway. That was the original intention of this whole thing either way, wasn\u2019t it? The fact that they let it get out of hand is another issue completely. \u201dSeriously. I mean \u2014 you asked if I wanted it to happen again and I,\u201d he tries to swallow his nerves down, not entirely sure of what he\u2019s saying, clinging to the embers of bravery behind his sternum, \u201dI don\u2019t know, but I\u2019ve been dealing with some shit lately and this,\u201d Lucas gestures lamely between them, \u201dwas a good distraction, kind of. In a way. So.\u201d</p><p>Eliott sighs, but it seems more pensive than weary. \u201dYeah,\u201d he says quietly. His shoulders move as he breathes in, breathes out. \u201dIt was a good distraction for me, too.\u201d</p><p>The words hang in the air between them for a moment.</p><p>Lucas turns his gaze away from Eliott\u2019s eyes when he finally says, after a while, \u201dBesides, I don\u2019t think I could just ignore it again,\u201d and then, with a flush starting to creep its way back onto Lucas\u2019s face, \u201dIt\u2014 it felt good for me, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201dYeah, I had an inkling,\u201d Eliott tells him. His voice gets lighter, just a fraction. \u201dYou weren\u2019t too quiet about it anyway\u2014\u201d and then Lucas can\u2019t help turning and kicking him in the shin because now his face is <i>burning</i> and as he mutters a quiet, \u201dOh, fuck you,\u201d Eliott yelps, \u201dOw, shit, that <i>hurt</i>, Lucas, what the hell\u2014\u201d and then he\u2019s laughing, eyes crinkling, the sound taking all the tension away with it.</p><p>Lucas exhales, then ducks his head to hide a smile of strange relief, sudden and simple and light.</p><p>*</p><p><br/>\u201dDude,\u201d Idriss says in between shoving fries into his mouth, \u201dwhat\u2019s this on your neck?\u201d</p><p>Lucas just kind of looks at him, distracted. \u201dWhat?\u201d</p><p>He knows it\u2019s bad manners but he hasn\u2019t really been paying attention to whatever Idriss has been talking about for the last few minutes. People in his Genetics class group chat have been arguing about the answers to their last test that Lucas is almost sure he bombed, and he couldn\u2019t help but glance at some of the messages because he\u2019s been trying to keep his hopes of passing this class somewhat alive. It\u2019s mostly a lost cause, but still.</p><p>Idriss sends him a look. Lucas puts his phone down.</p><p>\u201dYou have something on your neck,\u201d Idriss repeats with a smirk now, in his <i>innocent</i> voice, the one Lucas is all too familiar with. \u201dIt has piqued my curiosity, is all.\u201d</p><p>Lucas suddenly wishes he never asked.</p><p>\u201dI don\u2019t have anything on my neck,\u201d he says a bit too quickly, turning his gaze away from when Idriss\u2019s eyes light up the instant he hears how falsely neutral Lucas is trying to sound. It\u2019s such a weak lie he feels bad for himself for a second. \u201dWhy don\u2019t you focus on your food instead of staring at me?\u201d</p><p>They&rsquo;re at a McDonald&rsquo;s just off the campus, because Lucas can&rsquo;t afford anything fancier, really, and McDonald&rsquo;s has been Idriss&rsquo;s restaurant of choice even since Lucas met him at one of the parties they somehow both ended up attending. Eliott once told him that Idriss used to take girls on dates here. Idriss keeps denying the fact.</p><p>There is a group of middle schoolers in the corner arguing about something and shoving their phones in one another&rsquo;s faces, and a mother with a crying child a few tables in front of them, and the girl behind the cash register has been shooting Lucas strange looks ever since he stepped into the place. He has no idea why Idriss has to discuss the issue of whether or not there&rsquo;s a mark on Lucas&rsquo;s neck right now and right <i>here</i>. </p><p>\u201dBut you <i>do</i> have something,\u201d Idriss argues, fully smiling now, and Lucas thinks, <i>god damn it</i>, because how does he always end up in situations like these? He should have just gone back to reading the group chat messages, hell. Sofiane is right whenever he says Lucas makes it all too easy for Idriss, seriously. \u201dIt looks suspiciously similar to a hi\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201dIt\u2019s a bruise,\u201d he cuts in and then tries not to wince at how bad that was. \u201dIt\u2019s nothing, it\u2019s a bruise.\u201d</p><p>\u201dLucas, I mean this in the most loving way possible,\u201d Idriss says, looking like he&rsquo;s having the time of his life right now, \u201dbut do you think I\u2019m stupid?\u201d</p><p>And Lucas has no other choice but to sigh, then, and let Idriss steal two of his fries; he has to battle the urge to cover the mark on his neck with a hand like some girl in a badly scripted romantic comedy.</p><p>The things between him and Eliott\u2026keep happening. It\u2019s almost as if now that they\u2019ve acknowledged it, it just keeps going on its own. And it\u2019s not often, it\u2019s only happened twice since they got each other off on this godforsaken couch, but it\u2019s still often enough that the bruises Eliott bites into Lucas&rsquo;s neck don\u2019t really fully fade during the intermissions. Hence, there he is, in a McDonald&rsquo;s, of all places, fighting off a friend&rsquo;s dumb implications even though they are, in a way, true as well. It&rsquo;s a fucking hickey. It&rsquo;s not Lucas&rsquo;s fault that Eliott is so frustratingly good with his mouth, or that he seems to have a thing for Lucas&rsquo;s neck, or that Lucas lets him do whatever he wants, most of the time, because whatever Eliott does feels really goddamn great. </p><p>Lucas also realises, however, with a part of his mind that is not focused on tuning out the background McDonald&rsquo;s sounds or trying to deal with Idriss, that maybe they&rsquo;ve been a little stupid about it, he and Eliott. A little dumb, and not careful enough, even if it is surprisingly easy to let Eliott hold him tight, kiss him deep and searing, and press marks into his skin, in places Lucas can&rsquo;t cover or hide.</p><p>He takes a breath.</p><p>\u201dIdriss, can you let this go,\u201d Lucas mutters. He does his best to ignore the way the cashier girl keeps looking at him. Idriss steals another one of his fries, even though he still hasn\u2019t finished his own. \u201dI think we both know what it is, Jesus.\u201d</p><p>Idriss laughs. It sounds warm. \u201dWell, care to share, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201dAre you sure you want me to,\u201d Lucas asks instead of a <i>no</i>, because Idriss already know the answer anyway, \u201dbecause I could, but I was under the impression that you\u2019re playing for the other team, and the details\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201dAlright, alright, I\u2019m just messing with you,\u201d Idriss snickers, holding his hands up. Lucas rolls his eyes, can&rsquo;t help it, and Idriss raises his eyebrows at him. \u201dBut hey, good for you. You think anything\u2019s gonna come out of it?\u201d</p><p>This time, Lucas does lift his fingers to the mark, like he could rub it away as simple as that. His mind flits to the memory of Eliott fitting his mouth in the juncture between his neck and shoulder, biting at it and then soothing the sting with his tongue. Lucas pushes the thought down, into the corner of his mind where it belongs.</p><p>\u201dNo,\u201d he shakes his head, snaps out of it and then slaps Idriss\u2019s hand away when he tries to steal his food again. Idriss makes an affronted gasp. \u201dNo, it\u2019s nothing.\u201d</p><p>*</p><p><br/>After the next time, after Eliott presses Lucas to the front door of his apartment and kisses him deep, and then makes him gasp and shiver right there before moving further into the flat, after Lucas returns the favour and sucks Eliott off to the accompaniment of his gasps and an occasional quiet <i>fuck, Lucas</i> or <i>oh, God</i>, after they roll apart, Lucas says, \u201dI think we should make some rules.\u201d</p><p>Eliott, still breathing a little quicker than normal, mutters after just a moment too long, \u201dWhat rules?\u201d</p><p>\u201dRules,\u201d Lucas repeats, gestures between them where he\u2019s sitting with his legs crossed on the bed and where Eliott is stretched out just inches away with his boxers riding low on his hips, \u201dAbout this.\u201d</p><p>\u201dOh.\u201d Eliott turns his head to look at him. His eyes are dark. \u201dOkay, I guess. If you want.\u201d</p><p>Because, see, Lucas has thought about it. Ever since Idriss asked him about this stupid hickey that peeked over the collar of his t-shirt, and later when Lucas pressed his fingers to it, felt his pulse right there. He and Eliott might have agreed that they both get something out of it and that it\u2019s good, physically, for the both of them, which is great, but the thing is \u2014 things get blurry, sometimes, in those arrangements. Lines get crossed. And since they\u2019re friends, and Lucas would like to remain friends with Eliott in the future as well, and not ruin the friendship they have because they were too horny, once or twice, or not careful enough, rules would be a good idea. That\u2019s what he thinks.</p><p>He tells Eliott all that, at which he chuckles, unexpectedly, saying, \u201dYou sound like you have some experience with those arrangements,\u201d and then, \u201dIs there something I don\u2019t know about?\u201d</p><p>Lucas shoves at him without any real force behind it.</p><p>\u201dShut up,\u201d he says, but it comes out equal parts amused and bashful, weirdly, \u201dThere are a lot of things you don\u2019t know about.\u201d</p><p>Eliott sits up. The movement makes his underwear slide down his hips another inch. \u201dI\u2019m sure,\u201d he chuckles, running a hand through his hair. \u201dBut yeah, if you want rules, we can make some.\u201d</p><p>So Lucas rummages through the contents of his backpack until he finds a sheet of paper he could use \u2014 his biology assignment from a few weeks back \u2014 and fishes out a pen, too, and writes &ldquo;<i>rules</i>&rdquo; in big letters at the top of the page, underlines it twice.</p><p>They make a run for it. Lucas writes down <i>\u201dno telling anyone about this\u201d</i> and Eliott suggests <i>\u201dno leaving visible marks on each other\u201d</i>, laughing, after Lucas tells him about Idriss\u2019s oh-so-subtle comments. They add <i>\u201dboth free to date whoever they want\u201d</i> and <i>\u201dboth free to sleep with other people\u201d</i> as well because it seems fair, in a way. Then, Lucas writes <i>\u201dno sleeping in the same bed\u201d</i>, at which Eliott says, smirking, \u201dI knew you liked my couch after all.\u201d</p><p>At the end, they write, <i>\u201dno feelings\u201d</i>. This, too, Lucas underlines twice, with sharp movements, feeling a little silly.</p><p>Eliott falls back onto the bed when they\u2019re done and says, sounding a little amused, \u201dIt\u2019s like in <i>&ldquo;To All The Boys I\u2019ve Loved Before&rdquo;</i>,\u201d and Lucas can\u2019t hold back a laugh because <i>really</i>.</p><p>\u201dNo, it\u2019s not,\u201d he says as he rolls his eyes, folding the sheet of paper in half, then again, and then shoving it in his backpack. He\u2019s almost sure Mika has made him watch this movie at one point, but whatever he remembers of the plot is vague and kind of unclear because he\u2019s spent the majority of the film scrolling through the notifications on his phone instead of watching, until Mika wrestled the device from his grip, complaining about him not respecting their quality time spent together.</p><p>\u201dYeah, I mean,&ldquo; a shrug, &quot;they weren\u2019t sleeping with each other, but I\u2019m talking about the rules and all,\u201d Eliott tells him then. It rolls very casually off of his tongue.</p><p>And Lucas meant, really, that it\u2019s not like the movie because they\u2019re not going to fall for each other, but then swallows it down before it can leave his mouth.</p><p>&quot;Yeah, okay,&rdquo; he agrees. Eliott sends him a smile.</p><p>It\u2019s obvious enough anyway.</p>",

His eyes look less empty, and the glint in them is back, even if still significantly dulled. He holds himself straighter, walks around with a bounce in his step. Lucas doesn\u2019t dare to ask if it was his genius idea of a rebound that made Eliott feel better or if it was something else completely. He\u2019s not sure he wants to know.</p><p>And if he looks at Eliott\u2019s fingers curled around his paper cup a bit too long, as they leave the coffee shop, nobody has to know. Nobody has to know about how his eyes catch on Eliott\u2019s lips when he smiles in the afternoon sun, either, or about how Lucas thinks, <i>it happened. It happened. What the hell.</i></p><p>The thoughts are less nagging though, with each passing day. They\u2019re fine. They\u2019re friends. Eliott is fun to tease, fun to hang around with, fun to talk to. They might have slept together, but it was just once and they were both drunk and emotionally exhausted, and whatever happened between them was\u2014 it felt good, okay, but it was a one-time thing. Eliott had clearly pushed it out of his mind as soon as it happened. Lucas just needs to find a way to do the same. They\u2019re friends, just like they have been for the past few months, and if Lucas has to somehow deal with this weird mixture of relief and confusion he\u2019s feeling now, it\u2019s his own business. It\u2019s like nothing ever happened.</p><p>*</p><p>That is, until it happens again.</p><p>*</p><p><br>Lucas walks right into it. He can admit that, alright.</p><p>In his defence, when Eliott says he has some weed he wouldn\u2019t mind sharing as they\u2019re walking to the bus stop near the campus, Lucas thinks nothing of it. It\u2019s all good. They\u2019ve done this many times before. Eliott is sporting his casual <i>\u201dI\u2019m cool and tall and chill\u201d</i> vibe, shoulders slightly hunched, and it makes Lucas relax, too. It\u2019s very easy, he\u2019s discovered, to relax around Eliott.</p><p>So he says, \u201dYeah, sure,\u201d and shrugs, adding, \u201dfree weed doesn\u2019t hurt.\u201d</p><p>Eliott smiles in response. \u201dIt sure doesn\u2019t,\u201d is his answer, and that\u2019s that.</p><p>By this point, the memory of what happened between them feels more like something Lucas, for some reason, imagined than an actual thing that took place. It\u2019s been over 2 weeks. Lucas has been trying not to think about it, and can proudly announce that he\u2019s been mostly successful. There is an occasional shiver running through his body when Eliott does something and it catches him off guard, but it\u2019s stupid and Lucas just brushes it off as insignificant. <i>We\u2019re both back to normal</i>, he thinks.</p><p>It\u2019s his first mistake.</p><p>At Eliott\u2019s place, they kick their shoes off and hang their jackets by the front door and then Eliott goes to the kitchen to see if he has something in the fridge that they could actually eat while Lucas hangs around the living room. There\u2019s a new drawing pinned to the wall by the window, and Lucas looks at it for a while but for the life of him can\u2019t figure out what it\u2019s supposed to mean because it looks like modern art, something obscure and messy, a collage of sharp lines and dark colours, and he\u2019s not good with that. Eliott\u2019s the artist here.</p><p>He likes Eliott\u2019s art. Used to make fun of it, teasingly, at first, but quickly stopped when he realised how protective Eliott was of it, and how a stupid joke could make him feel bad when that wasn\u2019t Lucas\u2019s intention at all. He looks at the little art show on Eliott\u2019s wall pretty much whenever he comes over, notices when the drawings change or when Eliott tapes some new ones next to the ones Lucas already knows. Sometimes, when he looks at them, it\u2019s only in awe. Sometimes, it\u2019s in a strange, curled-in-his-chest onset of irrational jealousy.</p><p>He wishes, sometimes, that he had an outlet similar to how Eliott has his art. Something he could lose himself in when he doesn\u2019t want to think too much. Something he could create. Wonders what that\u2019s like, to make something out of nothing and have enough courage to show it to the world.</p><p>And then Eliott walks into the room and the moment passes and Lucas snaps out of it.</p><p>The time lingers, after that, but in a nice way. They smoke a bit, hang around and laugh and talk. Eliott puts on some music at one point and then pretends to get offended when Lucas says that dubstep is awful and asks him to turn it off, with a grin. Eliott turns the volume up instead and smirks. Lucas throws a pillow at him and misses, and then barely has time to react when Eliott picks it off the floor and flings right back in his direction as he comes back to the couch. It hits Lucas square in the face and he makes a high-pitched sound that causes Eliott to burst into laughter.</p><p>Lucas tries to hide his own responding smile under a frown but fails. \u201dIt\u2019s great that you\u2019re having so much fun mistreating me,\u201d he mutters, notes of amusement seeping into the sentence. Eliott shrugs, still grinning.</p><p>\u201dYou started it,\u201d he says, chuckles again and then picks up his half-smoked joint from where he\u2019s left it in the ashtray, takes a drag. Lucas watches the smoke when he breathes out, looks at it dissipate and disappear into the air between them. He can feel the atmosphere changing, shifting into something else.</p><p>Then, he says, \u201dyou\u2019re doing better.\u201d</p><p>It just slips out, before Lucas thinks about it, a statement but also not really. It\u2019s easy to say when Eliott looks the way he does, smiling wide like he never stopped, relaxed and joking around. It looks good on him.</p><p>Eliott turns to send him a glance and his eyes are bright. \u201dAm I?\u201d</p><p>\u201dAren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>It settles between them. Eliott takes another drag of his joint instead of an answer, and Lucas watches the smoke dissolve again, thin, then thinner until it\u2019s gone, and then, when he looks at Eliott again, Eliott is already looking back at him.</p><p>It goes downhill from there.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t know who kisses who first, this time around. He only knows that when it happens, he feels it all the way to his fingertips, the hard press of lips against lips, the heat. Lucas thinks, in a split second, that it\u2019s different now when he\u2019s sober; makes his breath catch. Eliott\u2019s hands are on his jaw, then in his hair, and Lucas feels the grip of his fingers tighten when he opens his mouth to let Eliott deepen the kiss. He curls his fingers into Eliott\u2019s t-shirt, feels Eliott bite on his bottom lip and tug on it gently, then lick into Lucas\u2019s mouth again and it\u2019s ridiculous, ridiculous how it sends a shiver down his spine. He presses himself closer, huffs a breath out when Eliott angles his head and presses Lucas firmer into the couch, push and pull, like a tide.</p><p>It\u2019s so easy, how Eliott grips his waist and how Lucas lets himself get manoeuvred into Eliott\u2019s lap and how they keep kissing like this, too, deep, searing kisses that make the air in the room heat up within moments.</p><p>\u201dFuck,\u201d Eliott utters when they part, under his breath, \u201dFuck, Lucas.\u201d</p><p>\u201dYeah,\u201d he manages and then kisses Eliott again, more of an instinct than choice because it feels <i>good</i> and he\u2019s not really high on the weed but feels a little bit high on <i>this</i>, already, and fuck, <i>fuck</i>. Here goes \u201dback to normal\u201d.</p><p>Eliott is solid underneath him where he shifts and presses a thigh between Lucas\u2019s legs, strong where he grips his waist with one hand while his other slides to Lucas\u2019s hip and settles there, heavy. Lucas lets go of Eliott\u2019s shirt and moves up, up his chest and up his neck and up into his hair, rakes his fingers through it, grips and angles Eliott\u2019s head where he wants it, then shivers when it makes Eliott\u2019s breath catch against his own lips.</p><p>It\u2019s dizzying. Lucas\u2019s head swims.</p><p>He presses his hips down, experimentally, an instinct again, because <i>fuck</i>, he\u2019s half-hard already just from kissing, just from this, then repeats the motion when it makes Eliott gasp. Lucas feels like he rarely feels \u2014 in control of what he does but also a bit unsettled, shifting like liquid. He grinds down again, and then Eliott drags him forward in his lap with the hand heavy on Lucas\u2019s hip and it creates the kind of pressure that makes Lucas break the kiss and curl in on himself with a swallowed down moan.</p><p>Eliott leaves a trail of kisses down the line of Lucas\u2019s jaw, hot and open-mouthed, then mutters into his skin, \u201dCan I\u2014 move you a little, just\u2014\u201d and Lucas is nodding before he knows it, slides his fingers through Eliott\u2019s hair again.</p><p>Eliott moves his hands down to Lucas\u2019s ass as he moves his mouth down, down to Lucas\u2019s neck, pushes them even closer together, firm and solid and Lucas feels, acutely, though four layers of fabric that separate them, how hard they both are. <i>Jesus</i>, he thinks. <i>Jesus fuck</i>.</p><p>He starts moving his hips in little circles, seeking friction, helpless when another stifled moan escapes him.</p><p>\u201dFuck, Lucas,\u201d he registers Eliott saying, emphasising each word with a scrape of teeth at the base of Lucas\u2019s neck like punctuation marks. Lucas angles his head, tries to give him more room. \u201dThat\u2019s so hot\u2014\u201d</p><p><i>What\u2019s hot</i>, he wants to say, but only another breathless sound comes out. He thinks, faintly, <i>what are we doing</i>, but it\u2019s barely there and gone when Eliott thrusts his hips up a little and Lucas falls forward a bit, wraps an arm around Eliott\u2019s neck. Maybe he is high, after all. He doesn\u2019t know. It\u2019s difficult to tell, at this point, when Eliott is underneath him like this, running warm, biting scalding kisses into Lucas\u2019s neck and toying with the waistband of Lucas\u2019s jeans where his shirt has ridden up.</p><p>\u201dEliott,\u201d he says into Eliott\u2019s hair, eyes closed. He knows he\u2019s flushed. He feels hot and liquid and heavy, like molasses. He grinds down again, sharper; it makes the heat build up, up. \u201dPlease, touch me.\u201d</p><p>And Eliott groans, \u201dOh, God,\u201d and then, \u201dOkay,\u201d and then, as if the words flipped some kind of switch from slow and testing to fast and hurried, his fingers are scrabbling at Lucas\u2019s fly and then he\u2019s shoving Lucas\u2019s pants down his hips, just a little, and then his hand is sneaking under Lucas\u2019s underwear and \u2014</p><p>Eliott wraps his fingers around him and Lucas moans where his lips are pressed against Eliott\u2019s temple, a high-pitched, breathy whine, followed by a series of equally whimpery, punched out <i>oh, oh</i> sounds when Eliott starts to move his hand, flicks his wrist in sharp motions that make Lucas hold on to him tighter and move his hips involuntarily. Lucas should be embarrassed, maybe, about the sounds he\u2019s making, or about how he\u2019s not going to last very long like this, with Eliott\u2019s fingers wrapped around him firmly. He doesn\u2019t really care at the moment.</p><p>He pushes a hand under Eliott\u2019s shirt, slides his palm over his ribs, doesn\u2019t know if the rapid pulse he\u2019s feeling is his own or not.</p><p>Eliott\u2019s hand keeps moving. Lucas loses track of time just a little bit. Everything narrows down to Eliott\u2019s touch, the heat of it building up low in Lucas\u2019s stomach, more and more with each stroke. He pushes into it, helpless, not even sure if he\u2019s making noise anymore, curled in on himself, lips pressed to Eliott\u2019s temple, then into his hair. Eliott\u2019s grip on him loosens, then tightens again, in a rhythm that makes Lucas dizzy, and it\u2019s good, it\u2019s very good. It\u2019s so fucking good, like this.</p><p>\u201dLucas, can I\u2014\u201d Eliott starts again, and Lucas is out of focus enough, out of it enough that he misses whatever Eliott gasps out next, only registers a fumbling gesture he makes between them and how his cheeks are flushed just slightly and then he\u2019s nodding, not sure what he\u2019s agreeing to, but barely caring anyway, hell, he just wants Eliott to keep it going, keep moving, keep making him feel like\u2014</p><p>And then Eliott\u2019s unzipping his own pants, unsteady and scuffling, and then he\u2019s shoving his own boxers down and he\u2019s shifting, pushes Lucas\u2019s hips down, down just a little, and then wraps his hand around both of them, hard and sliding together and Lucas crumples forward, thrusting into it, lightheaded and breathless and hot all over.</p><p>Eliott doesn\u2019t waste time after that, keeps the flicks of his wrist quick and sharp, moves his hips slightly to create even more friction when he can, leans in and Lucas feels his tongue and teeth at the base of his neck, and that\u2019s how he comes, a short while later, thrusting into the touch, gasping against Eliott\u2019s temple, shuddery and helpless, nails biting into Eliott\u2019s scalp.</p><p>When he finishes, following closely, Eliott drags him down into a messy kiss and Lucas lets himself be shifted and moved, a little out of breath, head swimming, loose on his shoulders.</p><p>*</p><p>It takes him a good couple of minutes to come back to himself and he spends them with his eyes closed, face turned down, while Eliott tries to catch his breath under him as well. The fog in his mind disperses, slowly but surely. Lucas sorts himself out with trembling hands, zips his jeans back up and can feel Eliott\u2019s eyes on him as he does.</p><p>When Lucas looks at him, the first thing Eliott says is, \u201dFuck.\u201d</p><p>His eyes are dark. His hair is a mess, and his lips are red from kissing. Lucas thinks, <i>I did that</i>.</p><p>He says, \u201dYeah,\u201d more of an exhale than anything else, then closes his eyes again. \u201dYeah, I know.\u201d</p><p>They roll away from each other, Lucas scrambling off of Eliott\u2019s lap, Eliott sinking a little further into the couch, heavy. Lucas keeps his eyes on the ceiling, then, looks at the shadows there, watches them move as the sunlight flicks into the room and then disappears again after a while. He can hear his own breathing and the blood rushing in his head, whispering like the sea. He waits for the storm to die down.</p><p>Then, he says, \u201dEliott,\u201d and when the boy looks at him, Lucas asks, still a little out of it, \u201dIs this going to keep happening?\u201d</p><p>Eliott blinks, then licks his lips, unsure at once. Lucas tries not to follow the movement too closely. \u201dI\u2014I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>And yeah. Lucas doesn\u2019t, either.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t think he could deal with another round of <i>they don\u2019t acknowledge it\u2014it drives Lucas crazy\u2014things go back to normal\u2014it happens again</i>, but at the same time, he\u2019s not sure what kind of answer he\u2019s expecting to get. If he\u2019s expecting an answer at all. Because okay, they could ignore one drunk excess late at night, in those hours when things are easier to write off as something else than they really are. But this? It\u2019s broad daylight; they\u2019re barely high. Whatever state of \u201dback to normal\u201d they managed to establish since that first time, it went crashing down the second Lucas let Eliott drag him into his lap and lick into his mouth.</p><p>\u201dWould you like for it to?\u201d</p><p>Lucas turns his head so fast his vision swims for a second, almost sure he\u2019s misheard something. But no \u2014 Eliott is looking at him expectantly from the other side of the couch, if a little sheepishly still. He seems unsettled, hesitant when he stretches his arms over the back of the couch, as if in an odd attempt to diffuse the strange atmosphere between them.</p><p>\u201dWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201dWould you,\u201d Eliott repeats, the licks his lips nervously again, \u201dwant it to happen again?\u201d</p><p>Lucas has heard the question the first time around, but it doesn\u2019t change the fact that when Eliott repeats it, his thought process sort of just screeches to a halt.</p><p>\u201dI mean\u2014I don\u2019t\u2014,\u201d he starts and then gets stuck, almost tripping over the words only to finish lamely, \u201d\u2014know.\u201d</p><p>Eliott takes a deep breath and sinks into the couch even more. Neither of them says anything for a moment. Lucas\u2019s mind keeps circling back to the question but can\u2019t come up with a decent answer, anything substantial. He fights the urge to bury his face in his hands.</p><p>Then, Eliott says, quietly, \u201dIt feels good. With you.\u201d</p><p>It catches Lucas off guard \u2014 enough for him to turn and look at Eliott fully, temporarily swallowing down how uncomfortable he feels. Eliott has tilted his head back and closed his eyes, and he\u2019s biting at his lip like he\u2019s not aware that he\u2019s doing it at all. He looks good, with the sun illuminating his profile where it\u2019s coming in through the window. Lucas wonders, stupidly, how come he\u2019d never realised just how ridiculously attractive Eliott really is until they slept together.</p><p>\u201dI don\u2019t know what it is about you, but\u2014\u201d Eliott goes on, but then stops abruptly like he\u2019s struggling with what he wants to say.</p><p>Lucas keeps looking at him. There\u2019s a weird kind of bravery sprouting shyly in his chest now, after Eliott\u2019s words. On a whim, he blurts out, \u201dI\u2019m a good rebound, then.\u201d</p><p>It comes out like a joke, but also not really. He watches a slight frown form between Eliott\u2019s eyebrows, and then the boy turns his head and finally peer at him. \u201dDon\u2019t talk about yourself like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201dWell, it\u2019s true. That\u2019s fine,\u201d Lucas shrugs before Eliott can say anything else, because really \u2014 it\u2019s not a big deal. Not <i>that</i> big, anyway. That was the original intention of this whole thing either way, wasn\u2019t it? The fact that they let it get out of hand is another issue completely. \u201dSeriously. I mean \u2014 you asked if I wanted it to happen again and I,\u201d he tries to swallow his nerves down, not entirely sure of what he\u2019s saying, clinging to the embers of bravery behind his sternum, \u201dI don\u2019t know, but I\u2019ve been dealing with some shit lately and this,\u201d Lucas gestures lamely between them, \u201dwas a good distraction, kind of. In a way. So.\u201d</p><p>Eliott sighs, but it seems more pensive than weary. \u201dYeah,\u201d he says quietly. His shoulders move as he breathes in, breathes out. \u201dIt was a good distraction for me, too.\u201d</p><p>The words hang in the air between them for a moment.</p><p>Lucas turns his gaze away from Eliott\u2019s eyes when he finally says, after a while, \u201dBesides, I don\u2019t think I could just ignore it again,\u201d and then, with a flush starting to creep its way back onto Lucas\u2019s face, \u201dIt\u2014 it felt good for me, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201dYeah, I had an inkling,\u201d Eliott tells him. His voice gets lighter, just a fraction. \u201dYou weren\u2019t too quiet about it anyway\u2014\u201d and then Lucas can\u2019t help turning and kicking him in the shin because now his face is <i>burning</i> and as he mutters a quiet, \u201dOh, fuck you,\u201d Eliott yelps, \u201dOw, shit, that <i>hurt</i>, Lucas, what the hell\u2014\u201d and then he\u2019s laughing, eyes crinkling, the sound taking all the tension away with it.</p><p>Lucas exhales, then ducks his head to hide a smile of strange relief, sudden and simple and light.</p><p>*</p><p><br>\u201dDude,\u201d Idriss says in between shoving fries into his mouth, \u201dwhat\u2019s this on your neck?\u201d</p><p>Lucas just kind of looks at him, distracted. \u201dWhat?\u201d</p><p>He knows it\u2019s bad manners but he hasn\u2019t really been paying attention to whatever Idriss has been talking about for the last few minutes. People in his Genetics class group chat have been arguing about the answers to their last test that Lucas is almost sure he bombed, and he couldn\u2019t help but glance at some of the messages because he\u2019s been trying to keep his hopes of passing this class somewhat alive. It\u2019s mostly a lost cause, but still.</p><p>Idriss sends him a look. Lucas puts his phone down.</p><p>\u201dYou have something on your neck,\u201d Idriss repeats with a smirk now, in his <i>innocent</i> voice, the one Lucas is all too familiar with. \u201dIt has piqued my curiosity, is all.\u201d</p><p>Lucas suddenly wishes he never asked.</p><p>\u201dI don\u2019t have anything on my neck,\u201d he says a bit too quickly, turning his gaze away from when Idriss\u2019s eyes light up the instant he hears how falsely neutral Lucas is trying to sound. It\u2019s such a weak lie he feels bad for himself for a second. \u201dWhy don\u2019t you focus on your food instead of staring at me?\u201d</p><p>They\u2019re at a McDonald\u2019s just off the campus, because Lucas can\u2019t afford anything fancier, really, and McDonald\u2019s has been Idriss\u2019s restaurant of choice even since Lucas met him at one of the parties they somehow both ended up attending. Eliott once told him that Idriss used to take girls on dates here. Idriss keeps denying the fact.</p><p>There is a group of middle schoolers in the corner arguing about something and shoving their phones in one another\u2019s faces, and a mother with a crying child a few tables in front of them, and the girl behind the cash register has been shooting Lucas strange looks ever since he stepped into the place. He has no idea why Idriss has to discuss the issue of whether or not there\u2019s a mark on Lucas\u2019s neck right now and right <i>here</i>. </p><p>\u201dBut you <i>do</i> have something,\u201d Idriss argues, fully smiling now, and Lucas thinks, <i>god damn it</i>, because how does he always end up in situations like these? He should have just gone back to reading the group chat messages, hell. Sofiane is right whenever he says Lucas makes it all too easy for Idriss, seriously. \u201dIt looks suspiciously similar to a hi\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201dIt\u2019s a bruise,\u201d he cuts in and then tries not to wince at how bad that was. \u201dIt\u2019s nothing, it\u2019s a bruise.\u201d</p><p>\u201dLucas, I mean this in the most loving way possible,\u201d Idriss says, looking like he\u2019s having the time of his life right now, \u201dbut do you think I\u2019m stupid?\u201d</p><p>And Lucas has no other choice but to sigh, then, and let Idriss steal two of his fries; he has to battle the urge to cover the mark on his neck with a hand like some girl in a badly scripted romantic comedy.</p><p>The things between him and Eliott\u2026keep happening. It\u2019s almost as if now that they\u2019ve acknowledged it, it just keeps going on its own. And it\u2019s not often, it\u2019s only happened twice since they got each other off on this godforsaken couch, but it\u2019s still often enough that the bruises Eliott bites into Lucas\u2019s neck don\u2019t really fully fade during the intermissions. Hence, there he is, in a McDonald\u2019s, of all places, fighting off a friend\u2019s dumb implications even though they are, in a way, true as well. It\u2019s a fucking hickey. It\u2019s not Lucas\u2019s fault that Eliott is so frustratingly good with his mouth, or that he seems to have a thing for Lucas\u2019s neck, or that Lucas lets him do whatever he wants, most of the time, because whatever Eliott does feels really goddamn great. </p><p>Lucas also realises, however, with a part of his mind that is not focused on tuning out the background McDonald\u2019s sounds or trying to deal with Idriss, that maybe they\u2019ve been a little stupid about it, he and Eliott. A little dumb, and not careful enough, even if it is surprisingly easy to let Eliott hold him tight, kiss him deep and searing, and press marks into his skin, in places Lucas can\u2019t cover or hide.</p><p>He takes a breath.</p><p>\u201dIdriss, can you let this go,\u201d Lucas mutters. He does his best to ignore the way the cashier girl keeps looking at him. Idriss steals another one of his fries, even though he still hasn\u2019t finished his own. \u201dI think we both know what it is, Jesus.\u201d</p><p>Idriss laughs. It sounds warm. \u201dWell, care to share, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201dAre you sure you want me to,\u201d Lucas asks instead of a <i>no</i>, because Idriss already know the answer anyway, \u201dbecause I could, but I was under the impression that you\u2019re playing for the other team, and the details\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201dAlright, alright, I\u2019m just messing with you,\u201d Idriss snickers, holding his hands up. Lucas rolls his eyes, can\u2019t help it, and Idriss raises his eyebrows at him. \u201dBut hey, good for you. You think anything\u2019s gonna come out of it?\u201d</p><p>This time, Lucas does lift his fingers to the mark, like he could rub it away as simple as that. His mind flits to the memory of Eliott fitting his mouth in the juncture between his neck and shoulder, biting at it and then soothing the sting with his tongue. Lucas pushes the thought down, into the corner of his mind where it belongs.</p><p>\u201dNo,\u201d he shakes his head, snaps out of it and then slaps Idriss\u2019s hand away when he tries to steal his food again. Idriss makes an affronted gasp. \u201dNo, it\u2019s nothing.\u201d</p><p>*</p><p><br>After the next time, after Eliott presses Lucas to the front door of his apartment and kisses him deep, and then makes him gasp and shiver right there before moving further into the flat, after Lucas returns the favour and sucks Eliott off to the accompaniment of his gasps and an occasional quiet <i>fuck, Lucas</i> or <i>oh, God</i>, after they roll apart, Lucas says, \u201dI think we should make some rules.\u201d</p><p>Eliott, still breathing a little quicker than normal, mutters after just a moment too long, \u201dWhat rules?\u201d</p><p>\u201dRules,\u201d Lucas repeats, gestures between them where he\u2019s sitting with his legs crossed on the bed and where Eliott is stretched out just inches away with his boxers riding low on his hips, \u201dAbout this.\u201d</p><p>\u201dOh.\u201d Eliott turns his head to look at him. His eyes are dark. \u201dOkay, I guess. If you want.\u201d</p><p>Because, see, Lucas has thought about it. Ever since Idriss asked him about this stupid hickey that peeked over the collar of his t-shirt, and later when Lucas pressed his fingers to it, felt his pulse right there. He and Eliott might have agreed that they both get something out of it and that it\u2019s good, physically, for the both of them, which is great, but the thing is \u2014 things get blurry, sometimes, in those arrangements. Lines get crossed. And since they\u2019re friends, and Lucas would like to remain friends with Eliott in the future as well, and not ruin the friendship they have because they were too horny, once or twice, or not careful enough, rules would be a good idea. That\u2019s what he thinks.</p><p>He tells Eliott all that, at which he chuckles, unexpectedly, saying, \u201dYou sound like you have some experience with those arrangements,\u201d and then, \u201dIs there something I don\u2019t know about?\u201d</p><p>Lucas shoves at him without any real force behind it.</p><p>\u201dShut up,\u201d he says, but it comes out equal parts amused and bashful, weirdly, \u201dThere are a lot of things you don\u2019t know about.\u201d</p><p>Eliott sits up. The movement makes his underwear slide down his hips another inch. \u201dI\u2019m sure,\u201d he chuckles, running a hand through his hair. \u201dBut yeah, if you want rules, we can make some.\u201d</p><p>So Lucas rummages through the contents of his backpack until he finds a sheet of paper he could use \u2014 his biology assignment from a few weeks back \u2014 and fishes out a pen, too, and writes \u201c<i>rules</i>\u201d in big letters at the top of the page, underlines it twice.</p><p>They make a run for it. Lucas writes down <i>\u201dno telling anyone about this\u201d</i> and Eliott suggests <i>\u201dno leaving visible marks on each other\u201d</i>, laughing, after Lucas tells him about Idriss\u2019s oh-so-subtle comments. They add <i>\u201dboth free to date whoever they want\u201d</i> and <i>\u201dboth free to sleep with other people\u201d</i> as well because it seems fair, in a way. Then, Lucas writes <i>\u201dno sleeping in the same bed\u201d</i>, at which Eliott says, smirking, \u201dI knew you liked my couch after all.\u201d</p><p>At the end, they write, <i>\u201dno feelings\u201d</i>. This, too, Lucas underlines twice, with sharp movements, feeling a little silly.</p><p>Eliott falls back onto the bed when they\u2019re done and says, sounding a little amused, \u201dIt\u2019s like in <i>\u201cTo All The Boys I\u2019ve Loved Before\u201d</i>,\u201d and Lucas can\u2019t hold back a laugh because <i>really</i>.</p><p>\u201dNo, it\u2019s not,\u201d he says as he rolls his eyes, folding the sheet of paper in half, then again, and then shoving it in his backpack. He\u2019s almost sure Mika has made him watch this movie at one point, but whatever he remembers of the plot is vague and kind of unclear because he\u2019s spent the majority of the film scrolling through the notifications on his phone instead of watching, until Mika wrestled the device from his grip, complaining about him not respecting their quality time spent together.</p><p>\u201dYeah, I mean,\u201c a shrug, \"they weren\u2019t sleeping with each other, but I\u2019m talking about the rules and all,\u201d Eliott tells him then. It rolls very casually off of his tongue.</p><p>And Lucas meant, really, that it\u2019s not like the movie because they\u2019re not going to fall for each other, but then swallows it down before it can leave his mouth.</p><p>\"Yeah, okay,\u201d he agrees. Eliott sends him a smile.</p><p>It\u2019s obvious enough anyway.</p></p>",

It\u2019s just\u2026on his mind. Sometimes.<br></p><p>Things are perfectly fine, really. Everything\u2019s great. Lucas\u2019s mom picks up the phone when he calls again and again, after two days of silence, and assures him she\u2019s okay. Her voice sounds airy through the speaker, and flimsy in a way voices sometimes sound, almost as if stretched thin, but Lucas doesn\u2019t know if it\u2019s because of something serious going on with her health or if it\u2019s just a shitty connection\u2019s fault, and the fact that he can\u2019t tell makes guilt coil in his stomach. His dad sends him money, miraculously. It\u2019s less than usual, and the notification he receives when he gets the transfer leaves him disgruntled and tense, even when he tries to push the feelings down, even when he tells himself he should be grateful for however small the amount of money sent his way is. It\u2019s not high school anymore. He has a job. He can get by.</p><p>So he gets by.</p><p>As for Eliott, they go out for coffee on Wednesday and hang around campus during when they both have a free period on Friday, as they usually do, and it\u2019s okay. Lucas good-naturedly insults Eliott\u2019s disgustingly sweet coffee that he orders and Eliott makes fun of the way Lucas grimaces when he takes the first sip of his own americano. He calls it pretentious. His smile is wide.</p><p>\u201dYou are the art student here,\u201d Lucas tells him, taking another sip. It burns his tongue a little. \u201dHow am I pretentious if you\u2019re the one walking around with a joint tucked behind your ear?\u201d</p><p>Eliott only rakes his hand through Lucas\u2019s hair in an attempt to jokingly shove him away, without any real force behind it. He laughs, \u201dYeah, whatever you say,\u201d and misses the glance Lucas shoots him as he fixes the mess on his head.</p><p>On Friday, they go and lay down on the grass in front of the Social Sciences building, amongst dozens of other students, and Eliott tells him about his new art project he\u2019s starting to work on for one of the classes and then plays a <i>\u201dwhat does this cloud remind you of\u201d</i> game\u2014with himself, mostly, because his ideas are so ridiculous that Lucas is, half the time, laughing too hard to even form a decent answer.</p><p>It\u2019s good.</p>[[MORE]]<p>Eliott seems better, too, slightly. His eyes look less empty, and the glint in them is back, even if still significantly dulled. He holds himself straighter, walks around with a bounce in his step. Lucas doesn\u2019t dare to ask if it was his genius idea of a rebound that made Eliott feel better or if it was something else completely. He\u2019s not sure he wants to know.</p><p>And if he looks at Eliott\u2019s fingers curled around his paper cup a bit too long, as they leave the coffee shop, nobody has to know. Nobody has to know about how his eyes catch on Eliott\u2019s lips when he smiles in the afternoon sun, either, or about how Lucas thinks, <i>it happened. It happened. What the hell.</i></p><p>The thoughts are less nagging though, with each passing day. They\u2019re fine. They\u2019re friends. Eliott is fun to tease, fun to hang around with, fun to talk to. They might have slept together, but it was just once and they were both drunk and emotionally exhausted, and whatever happened between them was\u2014 it felt good, okay, but it was a one-time thing. Eliott had clearly pushed it out of his mind as soon as it happened. Lucas just needs to find a way to do the same. They\u2019re friends, just like they have been for the past few months, and if Lucas has to somehow deal with this weird mixture of relief and confusion he\u2019s feeling now, it\u2019s his own business. It\u2019s like nothing ever happened.</p><p>*</p><p>That is, until it happens again.</p><p>*</p><p><br>Lucas walks right into it. He can admit that, alright.</p><p>In his defence, when Eliott says he has some weed he wouldn\u2019t mind sharing as they\u2019re walking to the bus stop near the campus, Lucas thinks nothing of it. It\u2019s all good. They\u2019ve done this many times before. Eliott is sporting his casual <i>\u201dI\u2019m cool and tall and chill\u201d</i> vibe, shoulders slightly hunched, and it makes Lucas relax, too. It\u2019s very easy, he\u2019s discovered, to relax around Eliott.</p><p>So he says, \u201dYeah, sure,\u201d and shrugs, adding, \u201dfree weed doesn\u2019t hurt.\u201d</p><p>Eliott smiles in response. \u201dIt sure doesn\u2019t,\u201d is his answer, and that\u2019s that.</p><p>By this point, the memory of what happened between them feels more like something Lucas, for some reason, imagined than an actual thing that took place. It\u2019s been over 2 weeks. Lucas has been trying not to think about it, and can proudly announce that he\u2019s been mostly successful. There is an occasional shiver running through his body when Eliott does something and it catches him off guard, but it\u2019s stupid and Lucas just brushes it off as insignificant. <i>We\u2019re both back to normal</i>, he thinks.</p><p>It\u2019s his first mistake.</p><p>At Eliott\u2019s place, they kick their shoes off and hang their jackets by the front door and then Eliott goes to the kitchen to see if he has something in the fridge that they could actually eat while Lucas hangs around the living room. There\u2019s a new drawing pinned to the wall by the window, and Lucas looks at it for a while but for the life of him can\u2019t figure out what it\u2019s supposed to mean because it looks like modern art, something obscure and messy, a collage of sharp lines and dark colours, and he\u2019s not good with that. Eliott\u2019s the artist here.</p><p>He likes Eliott\u2019s art. Used to make fun of it, teasingly, at first, but quickly stopped when he realised how protective Eliott was of it, and how a stupid joke could make him feel bad when that wasn\u2019t Lucas\u2019s intention at all. He looks at the little art show on Eliott\u2019s wall pretty much whenever he comes over, notices when the drawings change or when Eliott tapes some new ones next to the ones Lucas already knows. Sometimes, when he looks at them, it\u2019s only in awe. Sometimes, it\u2019s in a strange, curled-in-his-chest onset of irrational jealousy.</p><p>He wishes, sometimes, that he had an outlet similar to how Eliott has his art. Something he could lose himself in when he doesn\u2019t want to think too much. Something he could create. Wonders what that\u2019s like, to make something out of nothing and have enough courage to show it to the world.</p><p>And then Eliott walks into the room and the moment passes and Lucas snaps out of it.</p><p>The time lingers, after that, but in a nice way. They smoke a bit, hang around and laugh and talk. Eliott puts on some music at one point and then pretends to get offended when Lucas says that dubstep is awful and asks him to turn it off, with a grin. Eliott turns the volume up instead and smirks. Lucas throws a pillow at him and misses, and then barely has time to react when Eliott picks it off the floor and flings right back in his direction as he comes back to the couch. It hits Lucas square in the face and he makes a high-pitched sound that causes Eliott to burst into laughter.</p><p>Lucas tries to hide his own responding smile under a frown but fails. \u201dIt\u2019s great that you\u2019re having so much fun mistreating me,\u201d he mutters, notes of amusement seeping into the sentence. Eliott shrugs, still grinning.</p><p>\u201dYou started it,\u201d he says, chuckles again and then picks up his half-smoked joint from where he\u2019s left it in the ashtray, takes a drag. Lucas watches the smoke when he breathes out, looks at it dissipate and disappear into the air between them. He can feel the atmosphere changing, shifting into something else.</p><p>Then, he says, \u201dyou\u2019re doing better.\u201d</p><p>It just slips out, before Lucas thinks about it, a statement but also not really. It\u2019s easy to say when Eliott looks the way he does, smiling wide like he never stopped, relaxed and joking around. It looks good on him.</p><p>Eliott turns to send him a glance and his eyes are bright. \u201dAm I?\u201d</p><p>\u201dAren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>It settles between them. Eliott takes another drag of his joint instead of an answer, and Lucas watches the smoke dissolve again, thin, then thinner until it\u2019s gone, and then, when he looks at Eliott again, Eliott is already looking back at him.</p><p>It goes downhill from there.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t know who kisses who first, this time around. He only knows that when it happens, he feels it all the way to his fingertips, the hard press of lips against lips, the heat. Lucas thinks, in a split second, that it\u2019s different now when he\u2019s sober; makes his breath catch. Eliott\u2019s hands are on his jaw, then in his hair, and Lucas feels the grip of his fingers tighten when he opens his mouth to let Eliott deepen the kiss. He curls his fingers into Eliott\u2019s t-shirt, feels Eliott bite on his bottom lip and tug on it gently, then lick into Lucas\u2019s mouth again and it\u2019s ridiculous, ridiculous how it sends a shiver down his spine. He presses himself closer, huffs a breath out when Eliott angles his head and presses Lucas firmer into the couch, push and pull, like a tide.</p><p>It\u2019s so easy, how Eliott grips his waist and how Lucas lets himself get manoeuvred into Eliott\u2019s lap and how they keep kissing like this, too, deep, searing kisses that make the air in the room heat up within moments.</p><p>\u201dFuck,\u201d Eliott utters when they part, under his breath, \u201dFuck, Lucas.\u201d</p><p>\u201dYeah,\u201d he manages and then kisses Eliott again, more of an instinct than choice because it feels <i>good</i> and he\u2019s not really high on the weed but feels a little bit high on <i>this</i>, already, and fuck, <i>fuck</i>. Here goes \u201dback to normal\u201d.</p><p>Eliott is solid underneath him where he shifts and presses a thigh between Lucas\u2019s legs, strong where he grips his waist with one hand while his other slides to Lucas\u2019s hip and settles there, heavy. Lucas lets go of Eliott\u2019s shirt and moves up, up his chest and up his neck and up into his hair, rakes his fingers through it, grips and angles Eliott\u2019s head where he wants it, then shivers when it makes Eliott\u2019s breath catch against his own lips.</p><p>It\u2019s dizzying. Lucas\u2019s head swims.</p><p>He presses his hips down, experimentally, an instinct again, because <i>fuck</i>, he\u2019s half-hard already just from kissing, just from this, then repeats the motion when it makes Eliott gasp. Lucas feels like he rarely feels \u2014 in control of what he does but also a bit unsettled, shifting like liquid. He grinds down again, and then Eliott drags him forward in his lap with the hand heavy on Lucas\u2019s hip and it creates the kind of pressure that makes Lucas break the kiss and curl in on himself with a swallowed down moan.</p><p>Eliott leaves a trail of kisses down the line of Lucas\u2019s jaw, hot and open-mouthed, then mutters into his skin, \u201dCan I\u2014 move you a little, just\u2014\u201d and Lucas is nodding before he knows it, slides his fingers through Eliott\u2019s hair again.</p><p>Eliott moves his hands down to Lucas\u2019s ass as he moves his mouth down, down to Lucas\u2019s neck, pushes them even closer together, firm and solid and Lucas feels, acutely, though four layers of fabric that separate them, how hard they both are. <i>Jesus</i>, he thinks. <i>Jesus fuck</i>.</p><p>He starts moving his hips in little circles, seeking friction, helpless when another stifled moan escapes him.</p><p>\u201dFuck, Lucas,\u201d he registers Eliott saying, emphasising each word with a scrape of teeth at the base of Lucas\u2019s neck like punctuation marks. Lucas angles his head, tries to give him more room. \u201dThat\u2019s so hot\u2014\u201d</p><p><i>What\u2019s hot</i>, he wants to say, but only another breathless sound comes out. He thinks, faintly, <i>what are we doing</i>, but it\u2019s barely there and gone when Eliott thrusts his hips up a little and Lucas falls forward a bit, wraps an arm around Eliott\u2019s neck. Maybe he is high, after all. He doesn\u2019t know. It\u2019s difficult to tell, at this point, when Eliott is underneath him like this, running warm, biting scalding kisses into Lucas\u2019s neck and toying with the waistband of Lucas\u2019s jeans where his shirt has ridden up.</p><p>\u201dEliott,\u201d he says into Eliott\u2019s hair, eyes closed. He knows he\u2019s flushed. He feels hot and liquid and heavy, like molasses. He grinds down again, sharper; it makes the heat build up, up. \u201dPlease, touch me.\u201d</p><p>And Eliott groans, \u201dOh, God,\u201d and then, \u201dOkay,\u201d and then, as if the words flipped some kind of switch from slow and testing to fast and hurried, his fingers are scrabbling at Lucas\u2019s fly and then he\u2019s shoving Lucas\u2019s pants down his hips, just a little, and then his hand is sneaking under Lucas\u2019s underwear and \u2014</p><p>Eliott wraps his fingers around him and Lucas moans where his lips are pressed against Eliott\u2019s temple, a high-pitched, breathy whine, followed by a series of equally whimpery, punched out <i>oh, oh</i> sounds when Eliott starts to move his hand, flicks his wrist in sharp motions that make Lucas hold on to him tighter and move his hips involuntarily. Lucas should be embarrassed, maybe, about the sounds he\u2019s making, or about how he\u2019s not going to last very long like this, with Eliott\u2019s fingers wrapped around him firmly. He doesn\u2019t really care at the moment.</p><p>He pushes a hand under Eliott\u2019s shirt, slides his palm over his ribs, doesn\u2019t know if the rapid pulse he\u2019s feeling is his own or not.</p><p>Eliott\u2019s hand keeps moving. Lucas loses track of time just a little bit. Everything narrows down to Eliott\u2019s touch, the heat of it building up low in Lucas\u2019s stomach, more and more with each stroke. He pushes into it, helpless, not even sure if he\u2019s making noise anymore, curled in on himself, lips pressed to Eliott\u2019s temple, then into his hair. Eliott\u2019s grip on him loosens, then tightens again, in a rhythm that makes Lucas dizzy, and it\u2019s good, it\u2019s very good. It\u2019s so fucking good, like this.</p><p>\u201dLucas, can I\u2014\u201d Eliott starts again, and Lucas is out of focus enough, out of it enough that he misses whatever Eliott gasps out next, only registers a fumbling gesture he makes between them and how his cheeks are flushed just slightly and then he\u2019s nodding, not sure what he\u2019s agreeing to, but barely caring anyway, hell, he just wants Eliott to keep it going, keep moving, keep making him feel like\u2014</p><p>And then Eliott\u2019s unzipping his own pants, unsteady and scuffling, and then he\u2019s shoving his own boxers down and he\u2019s shifting, pushes Lucas\u2019s hips down, down just a little, and then wraps his hand around both of them, hard and sliding together and Lucas crumples forward, thrusting into it, lightheaded and breathless and hot all over.</p><p>Eliott doesn\u2019t waste time after that, keeps the flicks of his wrist quick and sharp, moves his hips slightly to create even more friction when he can, leans in and Lucas feels his tongue and teeth at the base of his neck, and that\u2019s how he comes, a short while later, thrusting into the touch, gasping against Eliott\u2019s temple, shuddery and helpless, nails biting into Eliott\u2019s scalp.</p><p>When he finishes, following closely, Eliott drags him down into a messy kiss and Lucas lets himself be shifted and moved, a little out of breath, head swimming, loose on his shoulders.</p><p>*</p><p>It takes him a good couple of minutes to come back to himself and he spends them with his eyes closed, face turned down, while Eliott tries to catch his breath under him as well. The fog in his mind disperses, slowly but surely. Lucas sorts himself out with trembling hands, zips his jeans back up and can feel Eliott\u2019s eyes on him as he does.</p><p>When Lucas looks at him, the first thing Eliott says is, \u201dFuck.\u201d</p><p>His eyes are dark. His hair is a mess, and his lips are red from kissing. Lucas thinks, <i>I did that</i>.</p><p>He says, \u201dYeah,\u201d more of an exhale than anything else, then closes his eyes again. \u201dYeah, I know.\u201d</p><p>They roll away from each other, Lucas scrambling off of Eliott\u2019s lap, Eliott sinking a little further into the couch, heavy. Lucas keeps his eyes on the ceiling, then, looks at the shadows there, watches them move as the sunlight flicks into the room and then disappears again after a while. He can hear his own breathing and the blood rushing in his head, whispering like the sea. He waits for the storm to die down.</p><p>Then, he says, \u201dEliott,\u201d and when the boy looks at him, Lucas asks, still a little out of it, \u201dIs this going to keep happening?\u201d</p><p>Eliott blinks, then licks his lips, unsure at once. Lucas tries not to follow the movement too closely. \u201dI\u2014I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>And yeah. Lucas doesn\u2019t, either.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t think he could deal with another round of <i>they don\u2019t acknowledge it\u2014it drives Lucas crazy\u2014things go back to normal\u2014it happens again</i>, but at the same time, he\u2019s not sure what kind of answer he\u2019s expecting to get. If he\u2019s expecting an answer at all. Because okay, they could ignore one drunk excess late at night, in those hours when things are easier to write off as something else than they really are. But this? It\u2019s broad daylight; they\u2019re barely high. Whatever state of \u201dback to normal\u201d they managed to establish since that first time, it went crashing down the second Lucas let Eliott drag him into his lap and lick into his mouth.</p><p>\u201dWould you like for it to?\u201d</p><p>Lucas turns his head so fast his vision swims for a second, almost sure he\u2019s misheard something. But no \u2014 Eliott is looking at him expectantly from the other side of the couch, if a little sheepishly still. He seems unsettled, hesitant when he stretches his arms over the back of the couch, as if in an odd attempt to diffuse the strange atmosphere between them.</p><p>\u201dWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201dWould you,\u201d Eliott repeats, the licks his lips nervously again, \u201dwant it to happen again?\u201d</p><p>Lucas has heard the question the first time around, but it doesn\u2019t change the fact that when Eliott repeats it, his thought process sort of just screeches to a halt.</p><p>\u201dI mean\u2014I don\u2019t\u2014,\u201d he starts and then gets stuck, almost tripping over the words only to finish lamely, \u201d\u2014know.\u201d</p><p>Eliott takes a deep breath and sinks into the couch even more. Neither of them says anything for a moment. Lucas\u2019s mind keeps circling back to the question but can\u2019t come up with a decent answer, anything substantial. He fights the urge to bury his face in his hands.</p><p>Then, Eliott says, quietly, \u201dIt feels good. With you.\u201d</p><p>It catches Lucas off guard \u2014 enough for him to turn and look at Eliott fully, temporarily swallowing down how uncomfortable he feels. Eliott has tilted his head back and closed his eyes, and he\u2019s biting at his lip like he\u2019s not aware that he\u2019s doing it at all. He looks good, with the sun illuminating his profile where it\u2019s coming in through the window. Lucas wonders, stupidly, how come he\u2019d never realised just how ridiculously attractive Eliott really is until they slept together.</p><p>\u201dI don\u2019t know what it is about you, but\u2014\u201d Eliott goes on, but then stops abruptly like he\u2019s struggling with what he wants to say.</p><p>Lucas keeps looking at him. There\u2019s a weird kind of bravery sprouting shyly in his chest now, after Eliott\u2019s words. On a whim, he blurts out, \u201dI\u2019m a good rebound, then.\u201d</p><p>It comes out like a joke, but also not really. He watches a slight frown form between Eliott\u2019s eyebrows, and then the boy turns his head and finally peer at him. \u201dDon\u2019t talk about yourself like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201dWell, it\u2019s true. That\u2019s fine,\u201d Lucas shrugs before Eliott can say anything else, because really \u2014 it\u2019s not a big deal. Not <i>that</i> big, anyway. That was the original intention of this whole thing either way, wasn\u2019t it? The fact that they let it get out of hand is another issue completely. \u201dSeriously. I mean \u2014 you asked if I wanted it to happen again and I,\u201d he tries to swallow his nerves down, not entirely sure of what he\u2019s saying, clinging to the embers of bravery behind his sternum, \u201dI don\u2019t know, but I\u2019ve been dealing with some shit lately and this,\u201d Lucas gestures lamely between them, \u201dwas a good distraction, kind of. In a way. So.\u201d</p><p>Eliott sighs, but it seems more pensive than weary. \u201dYeah,\u201d he says quietly. His shoulders move as he breathes in, breathes out. \u201dIt was a good distraction for me, too.\u201d</p><p>The words hang in the air between them for a moment.</p><p>Lucas turns his gaze away from Eliott\u2019s eyes when he finally says, after a while, \u201dBesides, I don\u2019t think I could just ignore it again,\u201d and then, with a flush starting to creep its way back onto Lucas\u2019s face, \u201dIt\u2014 it felt good for me, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201dYeah, I had an inkling,\u201d Eliott tells him. His voice gets lighter, just a fraction. \u201dYou weren\u2019t too quiet about it anyway\u2014\u201d and then Lucas can\u2019t help turning and kicking him in the shin because now his face is <i>burning</i> and as he mutters a quiet, \u201dOh, fuck you,\u201d Eliott yelps, \u201dOw, shit, that <i>hurt</i>, Lucas, what the hell\u2014\u201d and then he\u2019s laughing, eyes crinkling, the sound taking all the tension away with it.</p><p>Lucas exhales, then ducks his head to hide a smile of strange relief, sudden and simple and light.</p><p>*</p><p><br>\u201dDude,\u201d Idriss says in between shoving fries into his mouth, \u201dwhat\u2019s this on your neck?\u201d</p><p>Lucas just kind of looks at him, distracted. \u201dWhat?\u201d</p><p>He knows it\u2019s bad manners but he hasn\u2019t really been paying attention to whatever Idriss has been talking about for the last few minutes. People in his Genetics class group chat have been arguing about the answers to their last test that Lucas is almost sure he bombed, and he couldn\u2019t help but glance at some of the messages because he\u2019s been trying to keep his hopes of passing this class somewhat alive. It\u2019s mostly a lost cause, but still.</p><p>Idriss sends him a look. Lucas puts his phone down.</p><p>\u201dYou have something on your neck,\u201d Idriss repeats with a smirk now, in his <i>innocent</i> voice, the one Lucas is all too familiar with. \u201dIt has piqued my curiosity, is all.\u201d</p><p>Lucas suddenly wishes he never asked.</p><p>\u201dI don\u2019t have anything on my neck,\u201d he says a bit too quickly, turning his gaze away from when Idriss\u2019s eyes light up the instant he hears how falsely neutral Lucas is trying to sound. It\u2019s such a weak lie he feels bad for himself for a second. \u201dWhy don\u2019t you focus on your food instead of staring at me?\u201d</p><p>They\u2019re at a McDonald\u2019s just off the campus, because Lucas can\u2019t afford anything fancier, really, and McDonald\u2019s has been Idriss\u2019s restaurant of choice even since Lucas met him at one of the parties they somehow both ended up attending. Eliott once told him that Idriss used to take girls on dates here. Idriss keeps denying the fact.</p><p>There is a group of middle schoolers in the corner arguing about something and shoving their phones in one another\u2019s faces, and a mother with a crying child a few tables in front of them, and the girl behind the cash register has been shooting Lucas strange looks ever since he stepped into the place. He has no idea why Idriss has to discuss the issue of whether or not there\u2019s a mark on Lucas\u2019s neck right now and right <i>here</i>. </p><p>\u201dBut you <i>do</i> have something,\u201d Idriss argues, fully smiling now, and Lucas thinks, <i>god damn it</i>, because how does he always end up in situations like these? He should have just gone back to reading the group chat messages, hell. Sofiane is right whenever he says Lucas makes it all too easy for Idriss, seriously. \u201dIt looks suspiciously similar to a hi\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201dIt\u2019s a bruise,\u201d he cuts in and then tries not to wince at how bad that was. \u201dIt\u2019s nothing, it\u2019s a bruise.\u201d</p><p>\u201dLucas, I mean this in the most loving way possible,\u201d Idriss says, looking like he\u2019s having the time of his life right now, \u201dbut do you think I\u2019m stupid?\u201d</p><p>And Lucas has no other choice but to sigh, then, and let Idriss steal two of his fries; he has to battle the urge to cover the mark on his neck with a hand like some girl in a badly scripted romantic comedy.</p><p>The things between him and Eliott\u2026keep happening. It\u2019s almost as if now that they\u2019ve acknowledged it, it just keeps going on its own. And it\u2019s not often, it\u2019s only happened twice since they got each other off on this godforsaken couch, but it\u2019s still often enough that the bruises Eliott bites into Lucas\u2019s neck don\u2019t really fully fade during the intermissions. Hence, there he is, in a McDonald\u2019s, of all places, fighting off a friend\u2019s dumb implications even though they are, in a way, true as well. It\u2019s a fucking hickey. It\u2019s not Lucas\u2019s fault that Eliott is so frustratingly good with his mouth, or that he seems to have a thing for Lucas\u2019s neck, or that Lucas lets him do whatever he wants, most of the time, because whatever Eliott does feels really goddamn great. </p><p>Lucas also realises, however, with a part of his mind that is not focused on tuning out the background McDonald\u2019s sounds or trying to deal with Idriss, that maybe they\u2019ve been a little stupid about it, he and Eliott. A little dumb, and not careful enough, even if it is surprisingly easy to let Eliott hold him tight, kiss him deep and searing, and press marks into his skin, in places Lucas can\u2019t cover or hide.</p><p>He takes a breath.</p><p>\u201dIdriss, can you let this go,\u201d Lucas mutters. He does his best to ignore the way the cashier girl keeps looking at him. Idriss steals another one of his fries, even though he still hasn\u2019t finished his own. \u201dI think we both know what it is, Jesus.\u201d</p><p>Idriss laughs. It sounds warm. \u201dWell, care to share, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201dAre you sure you want me to,\u201d Lucas asks instead of a <i>no</i>, because Idriss already know the answer anyway, \u201dbecause I could, but I was under the impression that you\u2019re playing for the other team, and the details\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201dAlright, alright, I\u2019m just messing with you,\u201d Idriss snickers, holding his hands up. Lucas rolls his eyes, can\u2019t help it, and Idriss raises his eyebrows at him. \u201dBut hey, good for you. You think anything\u2019s gonna come out of it?\u201d</p><p>This time, Lucas does lift his fingers to the mark, like he could rub it away as simple as that. His mind flits to the memory of Eliott fitting his mouth in the juncture between his neck and shoulder, biting at it and then soothing the sting with his tongue. Lucas pushes the thought down, into the corner of his mind where it belongs.</p><p>\u201dNo,\u201d he shakes his head, snaps out of it and then slaps Idriss\u2019s hand away when he tries to steal his food again. Idriss makes an affronted gasp. \u201dNo, it\u2019s nothing.\u201d</p><p>*</p><p><br>After the next time, after Eliott presses Lucas to the front door of his apartment and kisses him deep, and then makes him gasp and shiver right there before moving further into the flat, after Lucas returns the favour and sucks Eliott off to the accompaniment of his gasps and an occasional quiet <i>fuck, Lucas</i> or <i>oh, God</i>, after they roll apart, Lucas says, \u201dI think we should make some rules.\u201d</p><p>Eliott, still breathing a little quicker than normal, mutters after just a moment too long, \u201dWhat rules?\u201d</p><p>\u201dRules,\u201d Lucas repeats, gestures between them where he\u2019s sitting with his legs crossed on the bed and where Eliott is stretched out just inches away with his boxers riding low on his hips, \u201dAbout this.\u201d</p><p>\u201dOh.\u201d Eliott turns his head to look at him. His eyes are dark. \u201dOkay, I guess. If you want.\u201d</p><p>Because, see, Lucas has thought about it. Ever since Idriss asked him about this stupid hickey that peeked over the collar of his t-shirt, and later when Lucas pressed his fingers to it, felt his pulse right there. He and Eliott might have agreed that they both get something out of it and that it\u2019s good, physically, for the both of them, which is great, but the thing is \u2014 things get blurry, sometimes, in those arrangements. Lines get crossed. And since they\u2019re friends, and Lucas would like to remain friends with Eliott in the future as well, and not ruin the friendship they have because they were too horny, once or twice, or not careful enough, rules would be a good idea. That\u2019s what he thinks.</p><p>He tells Eliott all that, at which he chuckles, unexpectedly, saying, \u201dYou sound like you have some experience with those arrangements,\u201d and then, \u201dIs there something I don\u2019t know about?\u201d</p><p>Lucas shoves at him without any real force behind it.</p><p>\u201dShut up,\u201d he says, but it comes out equal parts amused and bashful, weirdly, \u201dThere are a lot of things you don\u2019t know about.\u201d</p><p>Eliott sits up. The movement makes his underwear slide down his hips another inch. \u201dI\u2019m sure,\u201d he chuckles, running a hand through his hair. \u201dBut yeah, if you want rules, we can make some.\u201d</p><p>So Lucas rummages through the contents of his backpack until he finds a sheet of paper he could use \u2014 his biology assignment from a few weeks back \u2014 and fishes out a pen, too, and writes \u201c<i>rules</i>\u201d in big letters at the top of the page, underlines it twice.</p><p>They make a run for it. Lucas writes down <i>\u201dno telling anyone about this\u201d</i> and Eliott suggests <i>\u201dno leaving visible marks on each other\u201d</i>, laughing, after Lucas tells him about Idriss\u2019s oh-so-subtle comments. They add <i>\u201dboth free to date whoever they want\u201d</i> and <i>\u201dboth free to sleep with other people\u201d</i> as well because it seems fair, in a way. Then, Lucas writes <i>\u201dno sleeping in the same bed\u201d</i>, at which Eliott says, smirking, \u201dI knew you liked my couch after all.\u201d</p><p>At the end, they write, <i>\u201dno feelings\u201d</i>. This, too, Lucas underlines twice, with sharp movements, feeling a little silly.</p><p>Eliott falls back onto the bed when they\u2019re done and says, sounding a little amused, \u201dIt\u2019s like in <i>\u201cTo All The Boys I\u2019ve Loved Before\u201d</i>,\u201d and Lucas can\u2019t hold back a laugh because <i>really</i>.</p><p>\u201dNo, it\u2019s not,\u201d he says as he rolls his eyes, folding the sheet of paper in half, then again, and then shoving it in his backpack. He\u2019s almost sure Mika has made him watch this movie at one point, but whatever he remembers of the plot is vague and kind of unclear because he\u2019s spent the majority of the film scrolling through the notifications on his phone instead of watching, until Mika wrestled the device from his grip, complaining about him not respecting their quality time spent together.</p><p>\u201dYeah, I mean,\u201c a shrug, \"they weren\u2019t sleeping with each other, but I\u2019m talking about the rules and all,\u201d Eliott tells him then. It rolls very casually off of his tongue.</p><p>And Lucas meant, really, that it\u2019s not like the movie because they\u2019re not going to fall for each other, but then swallows it down before it can leave his mouth.</p><p>\"Yeah, okay,\u201d he agrees. Eliott sends him a smile.</p><p>It\u2019s obvious enough anyway.</p></p>",
                "content": "<p><h2><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/19321132/chapters/46162405\" target=\"_blank\"><i>things i forgot to tell you (ch. 2: that we keep it going)</i></a></h2><p><br /></p><p>It&rsquo;s not like he loses sleep over it. It&rsquo;s just&hellip;on his mind. Sometimes.<br /></p><p>Things are perfectly fine, really. Everything&rsquo;s great. Lucas&rsquo;s mom picks up the phone when he calls again and again, after two days of silence, and assures him she&rsquo;s okay. Her voice sounds airy through the speaker, and flimsy in a way voices sometimes sound, almost as if stretched thin, but Lucas doesn&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s because of something serious going on with her health or if it&rsquo;s just a shitty connection&rsquo;s fault, and the fact that he can&rsquo;t tell makes guilt coil in his stomach. His dad sends him money, miraculously. It&rsquo;s less than usual, and the notification he receives when he gets the transfer leaves him disgruntled and tense, even when he tries to push the feelings down, even when he tells himself he should be grateful for however small the amount of money sent his way is. It&rsquo;s not high school anymore. He has a job. He can get by.</p><p>So he gets by.</p><p>As for Eliott, they go out for coffee on Wednesday and hang around campus during when they both have a free period on Friday, as they usually do, and it&rsquo;s okay. Lucas good-naturedly insults Eliott&rsquo;s disgustingly sweet coffee that he orders and Eliott makes fun of the way Lucas grimaces when he takes the first sip of his own americano. He calls it pretentious. His smile is wide.</p><p>&rdquo;You are the art student here,&rdquo; Lucas tells him, taking another sip. It burns his tongue a little. &rdquo;How am I pretentious if you&rsquo;re the one walking around with a joint tucked behind your ear?&rdquo;</p><p>Eliott only rakes his hand through Lucas&rsquo;s hair in an attempt to jokingly shove him away, without any real force behind it. He laughs, &rdquo;Yeah, whatever you say,&rdquo; and misses the glance Lucas shoots him as he fixes the mess on his head.</p><p>On Friday, they go and lay down on the grass in front of the Social Sciences building, amongst dozens of other students, and Eliott tells him about his new art project he&rsquo;s starting to work on for one of the classes and then plays a <i>&rdquo;what does this cloud remind you of&rdquo;</i> game&mdash;with himself, mostly, because his ideas are so ridiculous that Lucas is, half the time, laughing too hard to even form a decent answer.</p><p>It&rsquo;s good.</p><p>Eliott seems better, too, slightly. His eyes look less empty, and the glint in them is back, even if still significantly dulled. He holds himself straighter, walks around with a bounce in his step. Lucas doesn&rsquo;t dare to ask if it was his genius idea of a rebound that made Eliott feel better or if it was something else completely. He&rsquo;s not sure he wants to know.</p><p>And if he looks at Eliott&rsquo;s fingers curled around his paper cup a bit too long, as they leave the coffee shop, nobody has to know. Nobody has to know about how his eyes catch on Eliott&rsquo;s lips when he smiles in the afternoon sun, either, or about how Lucas thinks, <i>it happened. It happened. What the hell.</i></p><p>The thoughts are less nagging though, with each passing day. They&rsquo;re fine. They&rsquo;re friends. Eliott is fun to tease, fun to hang around with, fun to talk to. They might have slept together, but it was just once and they were both drunk and emotionally exhausted, and whatever happened between them was&mdash; it felt good, okay, but it was a one-time thing. Eliott had clearly pushed it out of his mind as soon as it happened. Lucas just needs to find a way to do the same. They&rsquo;re friends, just like they have been for the past few months, and if Lucas has to somehow deal with this weird mixture of relief and confusion he&rsquo;s feeling now, it&rsquo;s his own business. It&rsquo;s like nothing ever happened.</p><p>*</p><p>That is, until it happens again.</p><p>*</p><p><br />Lucas walks right into it. He can admit that, alright.</p><p>In his defence, when Eliott says he has some weed he wouldn&rsquo;t mind sharing as they&rsquo;re walking to the bus stop near the campus, Lucas thinks nothing of it. It&rsquo;s all good. They&rsquo;ve done this many times before. Eliott is sporting his casual <i>&rdquo;I&rsquo;m cool and tall and chill&rdquo;</i> vibe, shoulders slightly hunched, and it makes Lucas relax, too. It&rsquo;s very easy, he&rsquo;s discovered, to relax around Eliott.</p><p>So he says, &rdquo;Yeah, sure,&rdquo; and shrugs, adding, &rdquo;free weed doesn&rsquo;t hurt.&rdquo;</p><p>Eliott smiles in response. &rdquo;It sure doesn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; is his answer, and that&rsquo;s that.</p><p>By this point, the memory of what happened between them feels more like something Lucas, for some reason, imagined than an actual thing that took place. It&rsquo;s been over 2 weeks. Lucas has been trying not to think about it, and can proudly announce that he&rsquo;s been mostly successful. There is an occasional shiver running through his body when Eliott does something and it catches him off guard, but it&rsquo;s stupid and Lucas just brushes it off as insignificant. <i>We&rsquo;re both back to normal</i>, he thinks.</p><p>It&rsquo;s his first mistake.</p><p>At Eliott&rsquo;s place, they kick their shoes off and hang their jackets by the front door and then Eliott goes to the kitchen to see if he has something in the fridge that they could actually eat while Lucas hangs around the living room. There&rsquo;s a new drawing pinned to the wall by the window, and Lucas looks at it for a while but for the life of him can&rsquo;t figure out what it&rsquo;s supposed to mean because it looks like modern art, something obscure and messy, a collage of sharp lines and dark colours, and he&rsquo;s not good with that. Eliott&rsquo;s the artist here.</p><p>He likes Eliott&rsquo;s art. Used to make fun of it, teasingly, at first, but quickly stopped when he realised how protective Eliott was of it, and how a stupid joke could make him feel bad when that wasn&rsquo;t Lucas&rsquo;s intention at all. He looks at the little art show on Eliott&rsquo;s wall pretty much whenever he comes over, notices when the drawings change or when Eliott tapes some new ones next to the ones Lucas already knows. Sometimes, when he looks at them, it&rsquo;s only in awe. Sometimes, it&rsquo;s in a strange, curled-in-his-chest onset of irrational jealousy.</p><p>He wishes, sometimes, that he had an outlet similar to how Eliott has his art. Something he could lose himself in when he doesn&rsquo;t want to think too much. Something he could create. Wonders what that&rsquo;s like, to make something out of nothing and have enough courage to show it to the world.</p><p>And then Eliott walks into the room and the moment passes and Lucas snaps out of it.</p><p>The time lingers, after that, but in a nice way. They smoke a bit, hang around and laugh and talk. Eliott puts on some music at one point and then pretends to get offended when Lucas says that dubstep is awful and asks him to turn it off, with a grin. Eliott turns the volume up instead and smirks. Lucas throws a pillow at him and misses, and then barely has time to react when Eliott picks it off the floor and flings right back in his direction as he comes back to the couch. It hits Lucas square in the face and he makes a high-pitched sound that causes Eliott to burst into laughter.</p><p>Lucas tries to hide his own responding smile under a frown but fails. &rdquo;It&rsquo;s great that you&rsquo;re having so much fun mistreating me,&rdquo; he mutters, notes of amusement seeping into the sentence. Eliott shrugs, still grinning.</p><p>&rdquo;You started it,&rdquo; he says, chuckles again and then picks up his half-smoked joint from where he&rsquo;s left it in the ashtray, takes a drag. Lucas watches the smoke when he breathes out, looks at it dissipate and disappear into the air between them. He can feel the atmosphere changing, shifting into something else.</p><p>Then, he says, &rdquo;you&rsquo;re doing better.&rdquo;</p><p>It just slips out, before Lucas thinks about it, a statement but also not really. It&rsquo;s easy to say when Eliott looks the way he does, smiling wide like he never stopped, relaxed and joking around. It looks good on him.</p><p>Eliott turns to send him a glance and his eyes are bright. &rdquo;Am I?&rdquo;</p><p>&rdquo;Aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p><p>It settles between them. Eliott takes another drag of his joint instead of an answer, and Lucas watches the smoke dissolve again, thin, then thinner until it&rsquo;s gone, and then, when he looks at Eliott again, Eliott is already looking back at him.</p><p>It goes downhill from there.</p><p>He doesn&rsquo;t know who kisses who first, this time around. He only knows that when it happens, he feels it all the way to his fingertips, the hard press of lips against lips, the heat. Lucas thinks, in a split second, that it&rsquo;s different now when he&rsquo;s sober; makes his breath catch. Eliott&rsquo;s hands are on his jaw, then in his hair, and Lucas feels the grip of his fingers tighten when he opens his mouth to let Eliott deepen the kiss. He curls his fingers into Eliott&rsquo;s t-shirt, feels Eliott bite on his bottom lip and tug on it gently, then lick into Lucas&rsquo;s mouth again and it&rsquo;s ridiculous, ridiculous how it sends a shiver down his spine. He presses himself closer, huffs a breath out when Eliott angles his head and presses Lucas firmer into the couch, push and pull, like a tide.</p><p>It&rsquo;s so easy, how Eliott grips his waist and how Lucas lets himself get manoeuvred into Eliott&rsquo;s lap and how they keep kissing like this, too, deep, searing kisses that make the air in the room heat up within moments.</p><p>&rdquo;Fuck,&rdquo; Eliott utters when they part, under his breath, &rdquo;Fuck, Lucas.&rdquo;</p><p>&rdquo;Yeah,&rdquo; he manages and then kisses Eliott again, more of an instinct than choice because it feels <i>good</i> and he&rsquo;s not really high on the weed but feels a little bit high on <i>this</i>, already, and fuck, <i>fuck</i>. Here goes &rdquo;back to normal&rdquo;.</p><p>Eliott is solid underneath him where he shifts and presses a thigh between Lucas&rsquo;s legs, strong where he grips his waist with one hand while his other slides to Lucas&rsquo;s hip and settles there, heavy. Lucas lets go of Eliott&rsquo;s shirt and moves up, up his chest and up his neck and up into his hair, rakes his fingers through it, grips and angles Eliott&rsquo;s head where he wants it, then shivers when it makes Eliott&rsquo;s breath catch against his own lips.</p><p>It&rsquo;s dizzying. Lucas&rsquo;s head swims.</p><p>He presses his hips down, experimentally, an instinct again, because <i>fuck</i>, he&rsquo;s half-hard already just from kissing, just from this, then repeats the motion when it makes Eliott gasp. Lucas feels like he rarely feels &mdash; in control of what he does but also a bit unsettled, shifting like liquid. He grinds down again, and then Eliott drags him forward in his lap with the hand heavy on Lucas&rsquo;s hip and it creates the kind of pressure that makes Lucas break the kiss and curl in on himself with a swallowed down moan.</p><p>Eliott leaves a trail of kisses down the line of Lucas&rsquo;s jaw, hot and open-mouthed, then mutters into his skin, &rdquo;Can I&mdash; move you a little, just&mdash;&rdquo; and Lucas is nodding before he knows it, slides his fingers through Eliott&rsquo;s hair again.</p><p>Eliott moves his hands down to Lucas&rsquo;s ass as he moves his mouth down, down to Lucas&rsquo;s neck, pushes them even closer together, firm and solid and Lucas feels, acutely, though four layers of fabric that separate them, how hard they both are. <i>Jesus</i>, he thinks. <i>Jesus fuck</i>.</p><p>He starts moving his hips in little circles, seeking friction, helpless when another stifled moan escapes him.</p><p>&rdquo;Fuck, Lucas,&rdquo; he registers Eliott saying, emphasising each word with a scrape of teeth at the base of Lucas&rsquo;s neck like punctuation marks. Lucas angles his head, tries to give him more room. &rdquo;That&rsquo;s so hot&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p><i>What&rsquo;s hot</i>, he wants to say, but only another breathless sound comes out. He thinks, faintly, <i>what are we doing</i>, but it&rsquo;s barely there and gone when Eliott thrusts his hips up a little and Lucas falls forward a bit, wraps an arm around Eliott&rsquo;s neck. Maybe he is high, after all. He doesn&rsquo;t know. It&rsquo;s difficult to tell, at this point, when Eliott is underneath him like this, running warm, biting scalding kisses into Lucas&rsquo;s neck and toying with the waistband of Lucas&rsquo;s jeans where his shirt has ridden up.</p><p>&rdquo;Eliott,&rdquo; he says into Eliott&rsquo;s hair, eyes closed. He knows he&rsquo;s flushed. He feels hot and liquid and heavy, like molasses. He grinds down again, sharper; it makes the heat build up, up. &rdquo;Please, touch me.&rdquo;</p><p>And Eliott groans, &rdquo;Oh, God,&rdquo; and then, &rdquo;Okay,&rdquo; and then, as if the words flipped some kind of switch from slow and testing to fast and hurried, his fingers are scrabbling at Lucas&rsquo;s fly and then he&rsquo;s shoving Lucas&rsquo;s pants down his hips, just a little, and then his hand is sneaking under Lucas&rsquo;s underwear and &mdash;</p><p>Eliott wraps his fingers around him and Lucas moans where his lips are pressed against Eliott&rsquo;s temple, a high-pitched, breathy whine, followed by a series of equally whimpery, punched out <i>oh, oh</i> sounds when Eliott starts to move his hand, flicks his wrist in sharp motions that make Lucas hold on to him tighter and move his hips involuntarily. Lucas should be embarrassed, maybe, about the sounds he&rsquo;s making, or about how he&rsquo;s not going to last very long like this, with Eliott&rsquo;s fingers wrapped around him firmly. He doesn&rsquo;t really care at the moment.</p><p>He pushes a hand under Eliott&rsquo;s shirt, slides his palm over his ribs, doesn&rsquo;t know if the rapid pulse he&rsquo;s feeling is his own or not.</p><p>Eliott&rsquo;s hand keeps moving. Lucas loses track of time just a little bit. Everything narrows down to Eliott&rsquo;s touch, the heat of it building up low in Lucas&rsquo;s stomach, more and more with each stroke. He pushes into it, helpless, not even sure if he&rsquo;s making noise anymore, curled in on himself, lips pressed to Eliott&rsquo;s temple, then into his hair. Eliott&rsquo;s grip on him loosens, then tightens again, in a rhythm that makes Lucas dizzy, and it&rsquo;s good, it&rsquo;s very good. It&rsquo;s so fucking good, like this.</p><p>&rdquo;Lucas, can I&mdash;&rdquo; Eliott starts again, and Lucas is out of focus enough, out of it enough that he misses whatever Eliott gasps out next, only registers a fumbling gesture he makes between them and how his cheeks are flushed just slightly and then he&rsquo;s nodding, not sure what he&rsquo;s agreeing to, but barely caring anyway, hell, he just wants Eliott to keep it going, keep moving, keep making him feel like&mdash;</p><p>And then Eliott&rsquo;s unzipping his own pants, unsteady and scuffling, and then he&rsquo;s shoving his own boxers down and he&rsquo;s shifting, pushes Lucas&rsquo;s hips down, down just a little, and then wraps his hand around both of them, hard and sliding together and Lucas crumples forward, thrusting into it, lightheaded and breathless and hot all over.</p><p>Eliott doesn&rsquo;t waste time after that, keeps the flicks of his wrist quick and sharp, moves his hips slightly to create even more friction when he can, leans in and Lucas feels his tongue and teeth at the base of his neck, and that&rsquo;s how he comes, a short while later, thrusting into the touch, gasping against Eliott&rsquo;s temple, shuddery and helpless, nails biting into Eliott&rsquo;s scalp.</p><p>When he finishes, following closely, Eliott drags him down into a messy kiss and Lucas lets himself be shifted and moved, a little out of breath, head swimming, loose on his shoulders.</p><p>*</p><p>It takes him a good couple of minutes to come back to himself and he spends them with his eyes closed, face turned down, while Eliott tries to catch his breath under him as well. The fog in his mind disperses, slowly but surely. Lucas sorts himself out with trembling hands, zips his jeans back up and can feel Eliott&rsquo;s eyes on him as he does.</p><p>When Lucas looks at him, the first thing Eliott says is, &rdquo;Fuck.&rdquo;</p><p>His eyes are dark. His hair is a mess, and his lips are red from kissing. Lucas thinks, <i>I did that</i>.</p><p>He says, &rdquo;Yeah,&rdquo; more of an exhale than anything else, then closes his eyes again. &rdquo;Yeah, I know.&rdquo;</p><p>They roll away from each other, Lucas scrambling off of Eliott&rsquo;s lap, Eliott sinking a little further into the couch, heavy. Lucas keeps his eyes on the ceiling, then, looks at the shadows there, watches them move as the sunlight flicks into the room and then disappears again after a while. He can hear his own breathing and the blood rushing in his head, whispering like the sea. He waits for the storm to die down.</p><p>Then, he says, &rdquo;Eliott,&rdquo; and when the boy looks at him, Lucas asks, still a little out of it, &rdquo;Is this going to keep happening?&rdquo;</p><p>Eliott blinks, then licks his lips, unsure at once. Lucas tries not to follow the movement too closely. &rdquo;I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p><p>And yeah. Lucas doesn&rsquo;t, either.</p><p>He doesn&rsquo;t think he could deal with another round of <i>they don&rsquo;t acknowledge it&mdash;it drives Lucas crazy&mdash;things go back to normal&mdash;it happens again</i>, but at the same time, he&rsquo;s not sure what kind of answer he&rsquo;s expecting to get. If he&rsquo;s expecting an answer at all. Because okay, they could ignore one drunk excess late at night, in those hours when things are easier to write off as something else than they really are. But this? It&rsquo;s broad daylight; they&rsquo;re barely high. Whatever state of &rdquo;back to normal&rdquo; they managed to establish since that first time, it went crashing down the second Lucas let Eliott drag him into his lap and lick into his mouth.</p><p>&rdquo;Would you like for it to?&rdquo;</p><p>Lucas turns his head so fast his vision swims for a second, almost sure he&rsquo;s misheard something. But no &mdash; Eliott is looking at him expectantly from the other side of the couch, if a little sheepishly still. He seems unsettled, hesitant when he stretches his arms over the back of the couch, as if in an odd attempt to diffuse the strange atmosphere between them.</p><p>&rdquo;What?&rdquo;</p><p>&rdquo;Would you,&rdquo; Eliott repeats, the licks his lips nervously again, &rdquo;want it to happen again?&rdquo;</p><p>Lucas has heard the question the first time around, but it doesn&rsquo;t change the fact that when Eliott repeats it, his thought process sort of just screeches to a halt.</p><p>&rdquo;I mean&mdash;I don&rsquo;t&mdash;,&rdquo; he starts and then gets stuck, almost tripping over the words only to finish lamely, &rdquo;&mdash;know.&rdquo;</p><p>Eliott takes a deep breath and sinks into the couch even more. Neither of them says anything for a moment. Lucas&rsquo;s mind keeps circling back to the question but can&rsquo;t come up with a decent answer, anything substantial. He fights the urge to bury his face in his hands.</p><p>Then, Eliott says, quietly, &rdquo;It feels good. With you.&rdquo;</p><p>It catches Lucas off guard &mdash; enough for him to turn and look at Eliott fully, temporarily swallowing down how uncomfortable he feels. Eliott has tilted his head back and closed his eyes, and he&rsquo;s biting at his lip like he&rsquo;s not aware that he&rsquo;s doing it at all. He looks good, with the sun illuminating his profile where it&rsquo;s coming in through the window. Lucas wonders, stupidly, how come he&rsquo;d never realised just how ridiculously attractive Eliott really is until they slept together.</p><p>&rdquo;I don&rsquo;t know what it is about you, but&mdash;&rdquo; Eliott goes on, but then stops abruptly like he&rsquo;s struggling with what he wants to say.</p><p>Lucas keeps looking at him. There&rsquo;s a weird kind of bravery sprouting shyly in his chest now, after Eliott&rsquo;s words. On a whim, he blurts out, &rdquo;I&rsquo;m a good rebound, then.&rdquo;</p><p>It comes out like a joke, but also not really. He watches a slight frown form between Eliott&rsquo;s eyebrows, and then the boy turns his head and finally peer at him. &rdquo;Don&rsquo;t talk about yourself like that.&rdquo;</p><p>&rdquo;Well, it&rsquo;s true. That&rsquo;s fine,&rdquo; Lucas shrugs before Eliott can say anything else, because really &mdash; it&rsquo;s not a big deal. Not <i>that</i> big, anyway. That was the original intention of this whole thing either way, wasn&rsquo;t it? The fact that they let it get out of hand is another issue completely. &rdquo;Seriously. I mean &mdash; you asked if I wanted it to happen again and I,&rdquo; he tries to swallow his nerves down, not entirely sure of what he&rsquo;s saying, clinging to the embers of bravery behind his sternum, &rdquo;I don&rsquo;t know, but I&rsquo;ve been dealing with some shit lately and this,&rdquo; Lucas gestures lamely between them, &rdquo;was a good distraction, kind of. In a way. So.&rdquo;</p><p>Eliott sighs, but it seems more pensive than weary. &rdquo;Yeah,&rdquo; he says quietly. His shoulders move as he breathes in, breathes out. &rdquo;It was a good distraction for me, too.&rdquo;</p><p>The words hang in the air between them for a moment.</p><p>Lucas turns his gaze away from Eliott&rsquo;s eyes when he finally says, after a while, &rdquo;Besides, I don&rsquo;t think I could just ignore it again,&rdquo; and then, with a flush starting to creep its way back onto Lucas&rsquo;s face, &rdquo;It&mdash; it felt good for me, too.&rdquo;</p><p>&rdquo;Yeah, I had an inkling,&rdquo; Eliott tells him. His voice gets lighter, just a fraction. &rdquo;You weren&rsquo;t too quiet about it anyway&mdash;&rdquo; and then Lucas can&rsquo;t help turning and kicking him in the shin because now his face is <i>burning</i> and as he mutters a quiet, &rdquo;Oh, fuck you,&rdquo; Eliott yelps, &rdquo;Ow, shit, that <i>hurt</i>, Lucas, what the hell&mdash;&rdquo; and then he&rsquo;s laughing, eyes crinkling, the sound taking all the tension away with it.</p><p>Lucas exhales, then ducks his head to hide a smile of strange relief, sudden and simple and light.</p><p>*</p><p><br />&rdquo;Dude,&rdquo; Idriss says in between shoving fries into his mouth, &rdquo;what&rsquo;s this on your neck?&rdquo;</p><p>Lucas just kind of looks at him, distracted. &rdquo;What?&rdquo;</p><p>He knows it&rsquo;s bad manners but he hasn&rsquo;t really been paying attention to whatever Idriss has been talking about for the last few minutes. People in his Genetics class group chat have been arguing about the answers to their last test that Lucas is almost sure he bombed, and he couldn&rsquo;t help but glance at some of the messages because he&rsquo;s been trying to keep his hopes of passing this class somewhat alive. It&rsquo;s mostly a lost cause, but still.</p><p>Idriss sends him a look. Lucas puts his phone down.</p><p>&rdquo;You have something on your neck,&rdquo; Idriss repeats with a smirk now, in his <i>innocent</i> voice, the one Lucas is all too familiar with. &rdquo;It has piqued my curiosity, is all.&rdquo;</p><p>Lucas suddenly wishes he never asked.</p><p>&rdquo;I don&rsquo;t have anything on my neck,&rdquo; he says a bit too quickly, turning his gaze away from when Idriss&rsquo;s eyes light up the instant he hears how falsely neutral Lucas is trying to sound. It&rsquo;s such a weak lie he feels bad for himself for a second. &rdquo;Why don&rsquo;t you focus on your food instead of staring at me?&rdquo;</p><p>They&rsquo;re at a McDonald&rsquo;s just off the campus, because Lucas can&rsquo;t afford anything fancier, really, and McDonald&rsquo;s has been Idriss&rsquo;s restaurant of choice even since Lucas met him at one of the parties they somehow both ended up attending. Eliott once told him that Idriss used to take girls on dates here. Idriss keeps denying the fact.</p><p>There is a group of middle schoolers in the corner arguing about something and shoving their phones in one another&rsquo;s faces, and a mother with a crying child a few tables in front of them, and the girl behind the cash register has been shooting Lucas strange looks ever since he stepped into the place. He has no idea why Idriss has to discuss the issue of whether or not there&rsquo;s a mark on Lucas&rsquo;s neck right now and right <i>here</i>. </p><p>&rdquo;But you <i>do</i> have something,&rdquo; Idriss argues, fully smiling now, and Lucas thinks, <i>god damn it</i>, because how does he always end up in situations like these? He should have just gone back to reading the group chat messages, hell. Sofiane is right whenever he says Lucas makes it all too easy for Idriss, seriously. &rdquo;It looks suspiciously similar to a hi&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&rdquo;It&rsquo;s a bruise,&rdquo; he cuts in and then tries not to wince at how bad that was. &rdquo;It&rsquo;s nothing, it&rsquo;s a bruise.&rdquo;</p><p>&rdquo;Lucas, I mean this in the most loving way possible,&rdquo; Idriss says, looking like he&rsquo;s having the time of his life right now, &rdquo;but do you think I&rsquo;m stupid?&rdquo;</p><p>And Lucas has no other choice but to sigh, then, and let Idriss steal two of his fries; he has to battle the urge to cover the mark on his neck with a hand like some girl in a badly scripted romantic comedy.</p><p>The things between him and Eliott&hellip;keep happening. It&rsquo;s almost as if now that they&rsquo;ve acknowledged it, it just keeps going on its own. And it&rsquo;s not often, it&rsquo;s only happened twice since they got each other off on this godforsaken couch, but it&rsquo;s still often enough that the bruises Eliott bites into Lucas&rsquo;s neck don&rsquo;t really fully fade during the intermissions. Hence, there he is, in a McDonald&rsquo;s, of all places, fighting off a friend&rsquo;s dumb implications even though they are, in a way, true as well. It&rsquo;s a fucking hickey. It&rsquo;s not Lucas&rsquo;s fault that Eliott is so frustratingly good with his mouth, or that he seems to have a thing for Lucas&rsquo;s neck, or that Lucas lets him do whatever he wants, most of the time, because whatever Eliott does feels really goddamn great. </p><p>Lucas also realises, however, with a part of his mind that is not focused on tuning out the background McDonald&rsquo;s sounds or trying to deal with Idriss, that maybe they&rsquo;ve been a little stupid about it, he and Eliott. A little dumb, and not careful enough, even if it is surprisingly easy to let Eliott hold him tight, kiss him deep and searing, and press marks into his skin, in places Lucas can&rsquo;t cover or hide.</p><p>He takes a breath.</p><p>&rdquo;Idriss, can you let this go,&rdquo; Lucas mutters. He does his best to ignore the way the cashier girl keeps looking at him. Idriss steals another one of his fries, even though he still hasn&rsquo;t finished his own. &rdquo;I think we both know what it is, Jesus.&rdquo;</p><p>Idriss laughs. It sounds warm. &rdquo;Well, care to share, then?&rdquo;</p><p>&rdquo;Are you sure you want me to,&rdquo; Lucas asks instead of a <i>no</i>, because Idriss already know the answer anyway, &rdquo;because I could, but I was under the impression that you&rsquo;re playing for the other team, and the details&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&rdquo;Alright, alright, I&rsquo;m just messing with you,&rdquo; Idriss snickers, holding his hands up. Lucas rolls his eyes, can&rsquo;t help it, and Idriss raises his eyebrows at him. &rdquo;But hey, good for you. You think anything&rsquo;s gonna come out of it?&rdquo;</p><p>This time, Lucas does lift his fingers to the mark, like he could rub it away as simple as that. His mind flits to the memory of Eliott fitting his mouth in the juncture between his neck and shoulder, biting at it and then soothing the sting with his tongue. Lucas pushes the thought down, into the corner of his mind where it belongs.</p><p>&rdquo;No,&rdquo; he shakes his head, snaps out of it and then slaps Idriss&rsquo;s hand away when he tries to steal his food again. Idriss makes an affronted gasp. &rdquo;No, it&rsquo;s nothing.&rdquo;</p><p>*</p><p><br />After the next time, after Eliott presses Lucas to the front door of his apartment and kisses him deep, and then makes him gasp and shiver right there before moving further into the flat, after Lucas returns the favour and sucks Eliott off to the accompaniment of his gasps and an occasional quiet <i>fuck, Lucas</i> or <i>oh, God</i>, after they roll apart, Lucas says, &rdquo;I think we should make some rules.&rdquo;</p><p>Eliott, still breathing a little quicker than normal, mutters after just a moment too long, &rdquo;What rules?&rdquo;</p><p>&rdquo;Rules,&rdquo; Lucas repeats, gestures between them where he&rsquo;s sitting with his legs crossed on the bed and where Eliott is stretched out just inches away with his boxers riding low on his hips, &rdquo;About this.&rdquo;</p><p>&rdquo;Oh.&rdquo; Eliott turns his head to look at him. His eyes are dark. &rdquo;Okay, I guess. If you want.&rdquo;</p><p>Because, see, Lucas has thought about it. Ever since Idriss asked him about this stupid hickey that peeked over the collar of his t-shirt, and later when Lucas pressed his fingers to it, felt his pulse right there. He and Eliott might have agreed that they both get something out of it and that it&rsquo;s good, physically, for the both of them, which is great, but the thing is &mdash; things get blurry, sometimes, in those arrangements. Lines get crossed. And since they&rsquo;re friends, and Lucas would like to remain friends with Eliott in the future as well, and not ruin the friendship they have because they were too horny, once or twice, or not careful enough, rules would be a good idea. That&rsquo;s what he thinks.</p><p>He tells Eliott all that, at which he chuckles, unexpectedly, saying, &rdquo;You sound like you have some experience with those arrangements,&rdquo; and then, &rdquo;Is there something I don&rsquo;t know about?&rdquo;</p><p>Lucas shoves at him without any real force behind it.</p><p>&rdquo;Shut up,&rdquo; he says, but it comes out equal parts amused and bashful, weirdly, &rdquo;There are a lot of things you don&rsquo;t know about.&rdquo;</p><p>Eliott sits up. The movement makes his underwear slide down his hips another inch. &rdquo;I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; he chuckles, running a hand through his hair. &rdquo;But yeah, if you want rules, we can make some.&rdquo;</p><p>So Lucas rummages through the contents of his backpack until he finds a sheet of paper he could use &mdash; his biology assignment from a few weeks back &mdash; and fishes out a pen, too, and writes &ldquo;<i>rules</i>&rdquo; in big letters at the top of the page, underlines it twice.</p><p>They make a run for it. Lucas writes down <i>&rdquo;no telling anyone about this&rdquo;</i> and Eliott suggests <i>&rdquo;no leaving visible marks on each other&rdquo;</i>, laughing, after Lucas tells him about Idriss&rsquo;s oh-so-subtle comments. They add <i>&rdquo;both free to date whoever they want&rdquo;</i> and <i>&rdquo;both free to sleep with other people&rdquo;</i> as well because it seems fair, in a way. Then, Lucas writes <i>&rdquo;no sleeping in the same bed&rdquo;</i>, at which Eliott says, smirking, &rdquo;I knew you liked my couch after all.&rdquo;</p><p>At the end, they write, <i>&rdquo;no feelings&rdquo;</i>. This, too, Lucas underlines twice, with sharp movements, feeling a little silly.</p><p>Eliott falls back onto the bed when they&rsquo;re done and says, sounding a little amused, &rdquo;It&rsquo;s like in <i>&ldquo;To All The Boys I&rsquo;ve Loved Before&rdquo;</i>,&rdquo; and Lucas can&rsquo;t hold back a laugh because <i>really</i>.</p><p>&rdquo;No, it&rsquo;s not,&rdquo; he says as he rolls his eyes, folding the sheet of paper in half, then again, and then shoving it in his backpack. He&rsquo;s almost sure Mika has made him watch this movie at one point, but whatever he remembers of the plot is vague and kind of unclear because he&rsquo;s spent the majority of the film scrolling through the notifications on his phone instead of watching, until Mika wrestled the device from his grip, complaining about him not respecting their quality time spent together.</p><p>&rdquo;Yeah, I mean,&ldquo; a shrug, \"they weren&rsquo;t sleeping with each other, but I&rsquo;m talking about the rules and all,&rdquo; Eliott tells him then. It rolls very casually off of his tongue.</p><p>And Lucas meant, really, that it&rsquo;s not like the movie because they&rsquo;re not going to fall for each other, but then swallows it down before it can leave his mouth.</p><p>\"Yeah, okay,&rdquo; he agrees. Eliott sends him a smile.</p><p>It&rsquo;s obvious enough anyway.</p></p>",

It&rsquo;s just&hellip;on his mind. Sometimes.<br /></p>\n<p>Things are perfectly fine, really. Everything&rsquo;s great. Lucas&rsquo;s mom picks up the phone when he calls again and again, after two days of silence, and assures him she&rsquo;s okay. Her voice sounds airy through the speaker, and flimsy in a way voices sometimes sound, almost as if stretched thin, but Lucas doesn&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s because of something serious going on with her health or if it&rsquo;s just a shitty connection&rsquo;s fault, and the fact that he can&rsquo;t tell makes guilt coil in his stomach. His dad sends him money, miraculously. It&rsquo;s less than usual, and the notification he receives when he gets the transfer leaves him disgruntled and tense, even when he tries to push the feelings down, even when he tells himself he should be grateful for however small the amount of money sent his way is. It&rsquo;s not high school anymore. He has a job. He can get by.</p>\n<p>So he gets by.</p>\n<p>As for Eliott, they go out for coffee on Wednesday and hang around campus during when they both have a free period on Friday, as they usually do, and it&rsquo;s okay. Lucas good-naturedly insults Eliott&rsquo;s disgustingly sweet coffee that he orders and Eliott makes fun of the way Lucas grimaces when he takes the first sip of his own americano. He calls it pretentious. His smile is wide.</p>\n<p>&rdquo;You are the art student here,&rdquo; Lucas tells him, taking another sip. It burns his tongue a little. &rdquo;How am I pretentious if you&rsquo;re the one walking around with a joint tucked behind your ear?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Eliott only rakes his hand through Lucas&rsquo;s hair in an attempt to jokingly shove him away, without any real force behind it. He laughs, &rdquo;Yeah, whatever you say,&rdquo; and misses the glance Lucas shoots him as he fixes the mess on his head.</p>\n<p>On Friday, they go and lay down on the grass in front of the Social Sciences building, amongst dozens of other students, and Eliott tells him about his new art project he&rsquo;s starting to work on for one of the classes and then plays a <i>&rdquo;what does this cloud remind you of&rdquo;</i> game&mdash;with himself, mostly, because his ideas are so ridiculous that Lucas is, half the time, laughing too hard to even form a decent answer.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s good.</p>\n</p>",

        "body": "<p><b>Summary:\u00a0</b><i>&ldquo;Can you believe we\u2019re in the Galapagos?\u201d Yann asked him. \u201cAnd that we only had to pay for the hotel?\u201d</i></p><p>Or, the one where Basile wins plane tickets to the Galapagos and takes his three friends with him for a one week vacation; there Lucas meets Eliott and, suddenly, one week doesn&rsquo;t seem like enough time.</p><p><b>Words: </b>3k</p><p>can also be read on my ao3 @ invisible_slytherin</p><p>Spending his Christmas or any other of his vacations outside of Paris was something Lucas, as a broke university student, never thought would happen.</p><p>It didn\u2019t seem plausible. Vacations cost money and money was something Lucas didn\u2019t have at his disposal, so it was never an option.</p><p>He was happy to spend his break from university with his friends and his mother and he didn&rsquo;t need to go somewhere abroad to have a good time. So, it wasn&rsquo;t like there was a deep desire to travel within him that came to life the days before every vacation.</p><p>Which didn&rsquo;t mean that he wouldn&rsquo;t accept the opportunity to go somewhere with open hands. In fact, he would accept it very quickly and be thankful for it. He just never thought it would happen.</p><p>But here he was. In front of the hotel where he and his three best friends would be staying for the next week. In Puerto Ayora, in the Santa Cruz Island, Galapagos.</p><p>It was a complete and unexpected change in scenery. And it was all, surprisingly, thanks to Basile, of all people.</p><!-- more --><p>If Lucas was being honest, he wasn\u2019t entirely sure how this even came to be. It had all started two months ago when Basile had been driving home after a date with Daphn\u00e9 and heard about a Christmas contest on the radio. In Basile&rsquo;s words, hearing it after spending time with his girlfriend was a sign of faith and he had to join in and try his luck. When he had gotten home that day and told Lucas, Arthur and Yann about it, the three of them had given him endless shit about it, joking about faith and destiny and powers.</p><p>But they had ended up eating their words. All their words. Because Basile had somehow won the contest and, with that, he had appeared home with four shiny tickets to Santa Cruz Island.</p><p>They kind of deserved all the teasing they had gotten from Basile and the threats of leaving them behind and taking Daphn\u00e9 with him that had come after that.</p><p>Of course, Basile being Basile had already told them that he wanted it to be a vacation for the gang and there wouldn\u2019t be any girls, \u2018or boys, Lucas\u2019, involved. That reassurance had toned down the fear of losing their opportunity to go to the Galapagos a bit. Just not enough to prevent them from doing Basile&rsquo;s chores for a whole two weeks without complaining.</p><p>It had been worth it, though. It had been worth it for the sun beating on their skin and the smell of the sea that was now enveloping them. For this, Lucas would do Basile\u2019s chores for a month.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Basile grinned at them, opening his arms wide. \u201cAm I the best or am I the best?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to admit,\u201d Arthur nodded, approvingly. \u201cJust this one time, you are the best.\u201d</p><p>Basile laughed and threw his arms around Lucas\u2019 and Arthur\u2019s shoulders, leading them into the hotel and yelling at Yann, who was walking behind them, to hurry up.</p><p>\u201cI would be faster if you guys would carry your own bags,\u201d Yann grumbled.</p><p>\u201cYou lost the bet, Yann,\u201d Lucas turned his head to grin teasingly at him. \u201cDeal with it.\u201d</p><p>They had made a bet while they were waiting for their plane at the airport back in Paris that the first person to fall asleep during the flight would have to carry all their bags from the cab to the hotel. Yann had been pretty confident that Arthur would be the one losing, but, in the end, he had spent nearly the whole flight sleeping and had actually been the first one to fall asleep.</p><p>\u201cIf you want help though,\u201d Arthur interrupted Lucas and Basile\u2019s laughs. \u201cJust say so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d Yann grunted, fixing the strap of the backpack he had on his shoulders. \u201cI got this. I\u2019m just glad none of us brought too much shit.\u201d</p><p>The hotel lobby was full of life when they entered, guests were talking and sitting on the sofas that were there and employees were walking around. A mix of different languages and accents could be heard and Lucas wondered if they were the only French people in the place or if they would meet anyone who had come from the same place.</p><p>The four of them walked further into the lobby, Arthur and Basile deciding they would be the ones doing the check-in and getting their room keys for them while Lucas and Yann found an empty sofa to sit on and wait.</p><p>Yann sighed, letting the bags drop to the floor and sitting down without a caring if there was something in them that could break and Lucas shook his head at him. Four backpacks and a suitcase didn&rsquo;t seem like much when he wasn&rsquo;t the one carrying them.</p><p>He let himself sit next to Yann and relax into the sofa.

He was jumping up and down a little too excitedly, but, to be fair, reasonably so. Lucas wouldn\u2019t make fun of him for it. Not this time, at least.</p><p>\u201cArthur is just getting the room keys, we can go up soon and then we can go explore,\u201d he rubbed his hands together.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if I wanna go anywhere today,\u201d Lucas shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m kinda tired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucas,\u201d Basile said while turning to Lucas and putting his hands on his shoulders, expression serious. \u201cI don\u2019t know if you noticed, but we\u2019re in Galapagos. Galapagos, Lucas. And you want to sleep?\u201d</p><p>Lucas rolled his eyes at Basile\u2019s over the top reaction.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me for being tired after a twenty-hour flight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care if you\u2019re tired. We\u2019re in Galapagos and we\u2019re going to enjoy it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can enjoy it tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy enjoy tomorrow what you can enjoy today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure that\u2019s how the saying goes-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got the keys,\u201d Arthur\u2019s voice interrupted their silly argument.</p><p>Basile yelled out, making some of the people in the lobby turn to stare at him, before snatching one of the keys from Arthur\u2019s hand and running to the elevators.</p><p>\u201cI wish I had that much energy,\u201d Lucas grumbled, grabbing his bag from where Yann had left it.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Lulu, you can rest a little while we\u2019re in the rooms and then we can go out later,\u201d Yann assured, putting a hand on Lucas\u2019 back and pushing him to where Arthur was scolding Basile while they waited for the elevator.</p><p>***</p><p>Yann had been right. All Lucas needed was a little rest before the adrenaline of being in the Galapagos really kicked in.</p><p>He was in a dreamy, warm place with his friends for the second half of his Christmas vacations. There really was nothing more he could ask for and, as much as he didn\u2019t like to admit it, Basile was right. It wasn\u2019t every day that they were in the Galapagos, they had to enjoy it as much as they could for the week they would be there. And Lucas would make sure to enjoy it as much as possible with the boys.</p><p>Yann had woken him up thirty minutes before they were supposed to leave for dinner, roughly pulling the blanket that had been covering him and almost yelling in his ear about warm weather and nice food. As annoyed as Lucas had been about it, he couldn\u2019t deny how much he actually wanted to go outside and experience the completely different place they were in.</p><p>However, considering he had been continuously telling Lucas to hurry up, Yann was now the one making them late and taking his sweet, sweet time in the bathroom.</p><p>Lucas had knocked on the door three times now and Basile had sent him over ten texts, all in caps lock, telling them they either hurried or him and Arthur would leave them behind. But there was really nothing much Lucas could do except stare out the window while waiting for Yann.</p><p>He could see the sea from there. There were people on the beach, people in the streets and the sun shining above all them. There were birds flying and a girl was walking her dog right in front of the hotel. He contemplated opening the window and letting the breeze coming from the sea into the room, but right when he was about to do that, the bathroom door finally opened and Yann walked out.</p><p>\u201cTook you long enough,\u201d Lucas raised an eyebrow while he pocketed his phone and grabbed the room key.</p><p>\u201cTaking care of yourself takes time, Lucas. You should try it sometime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Just hope Basile doesn\u2019t kill you and all that effort was for nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take my chances.\u201d</p><p>Lucas shook his head, laughing at Yann\u2019s completely laid back attitude and looked his friend up and down. He was now surer than ever about the reason why he had taken so long getting ready.</p><p>\u201cPlanning on bringing someone to our room tonight?\u201d He asked. \u201cBecause if you are, I want to know so I can go and room with Arthur and Basile.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not bringing anyone into our room, Lucas,\u201d he rolled his eyes, amused. \u201cI\u2019m not gonna kick my best friend out for a hookup.\u201d</p><p>Lucas hummed.</p><p>\u201cVery grateful for that.\u201d</p><p>They stepped out of the room and closed the door behind them, making sure the lights were turned off and that they had everything they needed on their pockets so that they wouldn\u2019t have to come back to the hotel earlier than expected.</p><p>\u201cNext time, please wake up earlier, Lucas,\u201d Arthur told him when they met at the lobby. \u201cI couldn\u2019t stand listening to Baz whine any longer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t my fault, alright? I was awake for a long time. Yann was the one getting all ready to find a lady tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I hope keeping us waiting will be worth it at the end of the night, then,\u201d Arthur shrugged before leading the way out of the hotel.</p><p>The evening wasn\u2019t too hot like Lucas had feared after the dreadful heat they had experienced when they had arrived. It was actually the perfect warmth to walk around comfortably and enjoy the view.</p><p>Puerto Ayora was a beautiful place, full of life and sounds and colours. Lucas didn\u2019t even know if he wanted to look at the people passing by, at the stores, at the sky or at the sea. Everything was calling his attention, screaming softly to be looked at.</p><p>\u201cBaz, I gotta say. This is amazing,\u201d he couldn\u2019t help but say, awe in his voice.</p><p>\u201cIt is, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Basile grinned at him, bumping their shoulders together, pride and excitement written all over his face.</p><p>\u201cYou can enter whatever contests you want to in the future and we won\u2019t even say anything,\u201d Yann promised.</p><p>\u201cNext time I win,\u201d Basile said as if it was already a sure thing that would happen without any doubts. \u201cI\u2019ll go on vacation with Daphn\u00e9, though. This time it was for us, but she\u2019s my girlfriend you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow sweet,\u201d Lucas said sarcastically.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Lulu, you\u2019ll understand one day. When you find your own Daphn\u00e9.\u201d</p><p>Lucas snorted.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I want to find a Daphn\u00e9, thanks,\u201d he clapped Basile on the back while Arthur and Yann sniggered next to them.</p><p>\u201cOr, you know, your male Daphn\u00e9.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy male Dahpn\u00e9?\u201dLucas raised an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Basile looked a little unsure but ready to go on with his idea. \u201cYou know-\u201d</p><p>\u201cBasile, buddy,\u201d Yann threw an arm around his shoulder. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s better if you don\u2019t even try to explain that one.\u201d</p><p>Basile blinked, before shrugging and almost pulling Yann with him in his hurry to get to the restaurant he had just seen.</p><p>To be fair, Lucas was hungry too and he also couldn\u2019t wait to get somewhere where they could finally eat something since they hadn\u2019t really had any real food since their flight.</p><p>***</p><p>Their dinner had been great. Maybe a little too expensive for them, they would surely have to find a more suited place for the money they had in the next days. They would have time for that when they do some exploring of the city, a meal at a more expensive restaurant was hardly a big problem.</p><p>They were now walking by the beach. The smell of the sea embracing them and the breeze touching their skins. It felt amazing and relaxing and Lucas felt like he was exactly where he wanted to be and where he belonged, despite the long distance from home. He was with his three best friends, their laughs loud and full while they recorded something dumb for their Insta stories and Lucas stopped and sat on a stone bench and just looked around himself.</p><p>He was lucky to be here and he was more than grateful for it. Maybe spending vacations in a completely new place was exactly what he had been in need of without even realizing it.</p><p>\u201cYou alright, Lucas?\u201d Arthur asked, approaching him while Basile attempted to do a handstand in the middle of the sidewalk while Yann filmed it.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Lucas smiled at him. \u201cThis is great.\u201d</p><p>Arthur grinned, turned to look at the other two and his grin stretched a bit more.</p><p>\u201cIt really is.\u201d</p><p>They stood in silence for a few seconds. Arthur probably knew that Lucas was just taking everything in and processing what was around him, enjoying the peacefulness that was bathing them.</p><p>\u201cAre you guys coming?\u201d Yann called out.</p><p>Arthur turned to stare at Lucas with a raised eyebrow, a silent question.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Lucas answered, firstly only to Arthur and then louder so the other two could hear him. \u201cWe are.\u201d</p><p>They approached the place where the other two were, both bent over their phones, publishing the dumb videos they had made to their Insta stories. Lucas smiled and kicked Yann\u2019s shin playfully.</p><p>\u201cSo, any more plans for tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe could go to a club, I\u2019m sure we can find one easily,\u201d Basile suggested, already looking around for one.</p><p>\u201cWe only just got here and you already want to get into a club? You can do that back at home!\u201d Arthur argued.</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m sure clubs here are different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDifferent. Clubs are clubs, there are drinks and people and music. You really can\u2019t do that in many different ways.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill. Are you telling me that you come to the Galapagos and don\u2019t even want to go clubbing once while you\u2019re here?\u201d Basile sounded quite offended by that thought.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I\u2019m saying. I\u2019m just saying that this is our first night here, we could spend it in a different way and go clubbing tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m with Arthur on this,\u201d Yann interrupted before any of the two could say anything else. \u201cLucas might have slept the afternoon away, but I didn\u2019t and I don\u2019t know about you but I\u2019m tired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can just walk around for a little longer, maybe get ice cream, eat it on the beach, and then go back to the hotel and call it a night,\u201d Lucas said, hopping the suggestion was good enough for the three of them.</p><p>\u201cSounds good to me,\u201d Arthur shrugged.</p><p>Yann agreed quickly too and Basile, although still looking a little mad about not going to the club, followed them without complaining too much, only grabbing his phone and typing away with a small pout on his lips, before it quickly vanished into a smile, no doubt at the sight of a text from Daphn\u00e9.</p><p>If every night was like this one, and even though he would still be with his friends in Paris, it would be terribly hard to say goodbye to the Island and this trip.</p>",

And it was all, surprisingly, thanks to Basile, of all people.</p>[[MORE]]<p>If Lucas was being honest, he wasn\u2019t entirely sure how this even came to be. It had all started two months ago when Basile had been driving home after a date with Daphn\u00e9 and heard about a Christmas contest on the radio. In Basile\u2019s words, hearing it after spending time with his girlfriend was a sign of faith and he had to join in and try his luck. When he had gotten home that day and told Lucas, Arthur and Yann about it, the three of them had given him endless shit about it, joking about faith and destiny and powers.</p><p>But they had ended up eating their words. All their words. Because Basile had somehow won the contest and, with that, he had appeared home with four shiny tickets to Santa Cruz Island.</p><p>They kind of deserved all the teasing they had gotten from Basile and the threats of leaving them behind and taking Daphn\u00e9 with him that had come after that.</p><p>Of course, Basile being Basile had already told them that he wanted it to be a vacation for the gang and there wouldn\u2019t be any girls, \u2018or boys, Lucas\u2019, involved. That reassurance had toned down the fear of losing their opportunity to go to the Galapagos a bit. Just not enough to prevent them from doing Basile\u2019s chores for a whole two weeks without complaining.</p><p>It had been worth it, though. It had been worth it for the sun beating on their skin and the smell of the sea that was now enveloping them. For this, Lucas would do Basile\u2019s chores for a month.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Basile grinned at them, opening his arms wide. \u201cAm I the best or am I the best?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to admit,\u201d Arthur nodded, approvingly. \u201cJust this one time, you are the best.\u201d</p><p>Basile laughed and threw his arms around Lucas\u2019 and Arthur\u2019s shoulders, leading them into the hotel and yelling at Yann, who was walking behind them, to hurry up.</p><p>\u201cI would be faster if you guys would carry your own bags,\u201d Yann grumbled.</p><p>\u201cYou lost the bet, Yann,\u201d Lucas turned his head to grin teasingly at him. \u201cDeal with it.\u201d</p><p>They had made a bet while they were waiting for their plane at the airport back in Paris that the first person to fall asleep during the flight would have to carry all their bags from the cab to the hotel. Yann had been pretty confident that Arthur would be the one losing, but, in the end, he had spent nearly the whole flight sleeping and had actually been the first one to fall asleep.</p><p>\u201cIf you want help though,\u201d Arthur interrupted Lucas and Basile\u2019s laughs. \u201cJust say so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d Yann grunted, fixing the strap of the backpack he had on his shoulders. \u201cI got this. I\u2019m just glad none of us brought too much shit.\u201d</p><p>The hotel lobby was full of life when they entered, guests were talking and sitting on the sofas that were there and employees were walking around. A mix of different languages and accents could be heard and Lucas wondered if they were the only French people in the place or if they would meet anyone who had come from the same place.</p><p>The four of them walked further into the lobby, Arthur and Basile deciding they would be the ones doing the check-in and getting their room keys for them while Lucas and Yann found an empty sofa to sit on and wait.</p><p>Yann sighed, letting the bags drop to the floor and sitting down without a caring if there was something in them that could break and Lucas shook his head at him. Four backpacks and a suitcase didn\u2019t seem like much when he wasn\u2019t the one carrying them.</p><p>He let himself sit next to Yann and relax into the sofa. The air conditioning in the hotel lobby was a big improvement from the excessive heat outside and Lucas couldn\u2019t be more grateful for small mercies of modern times as he was right now.</p><p>He knew that December in the Galapagos Islands is supposed to be like June in France, which, technically, means warmer temperatures and the beginning of Summer.

Yann was the one getting all ready to find a lady tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I hope keeping us waiting will be worth it at the end of the night, then,\u201d Arthur shrugged before leading the way out of the hotel.</p><p>The evening wasn\u2019t too hot like Lucas had feared after the dreadful heat they had experienced when they had arrived. It was actually the perfect warmth to walk around comfortably and enjoy the view.</p><p>Puerto Ayora was a beautiful place, full of life and sounds and colours. Lucas didn\u2019t even know if he wanted to look at the people passing by, at the stores, at the sky or at the sea. Everything was calling his attention, screaming softly to be looked at.</p><p>\u201cBaz, I gotta say. This is amazing,\u201d he couldn\u2019t help but say, awe in his voice.</p><p>\u201cIt is, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Basile grinned at him, bumping their shoulders together, pride and excitement written all over his face.</p><p>\u201cYou can enter whatever contests you want to in the future and we won\u2019t even say anything,\u201d Yann promised.</p><p>\u201cNext time I win,\u201d Basile said as if it was already a sure thing that would happen without any doubts. \u201cI\u2019ll go on vacation with Daphn\u00e9, though. This time it was for us, but she\u2019s my girlfriend you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow sweet,\u201d Lucas said sarcastically.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Lulu, you\u2019ll understand one day. When you find your own Daphn\u00e9.\u201d</p><p>Lucas snorted.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I want to find a Daphn\u00e9, thanks,\u201d he clapped Basile on the back while Arthur and Yann sniggered next to them.</p><p>\u201cOr, you know, your male Daphn\u00e9.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy male Dahpn\u00e9?\u201dLucas raised an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Basile looked a little unsure but ready to go on with his idea. \u201cYou know-\u201d</p><p>\u201cBasile, buddy,\u201d Yann threw an arm around his shoulder. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s better if you don\u2019t even try to explain that one.\u201d</p><p>Basile blinked, before shrugging and almost pulling Yann with him in his hurry to get to the restaurant he had just seen.</p><p>To be fair, Lucas was hungry too and he also couldn\u2019t wait to get somewhere where they could finally eat something since they hadn\u2019t really had any real food since their flight.</p><p>***</p><p>Their dinner had been great. Maybe a little too expensive for them, they would surely have to find a more suited place for the money they had in the next days. They would have time for that when they do some exploring of the city, a meal at a more expensive restaurant was hardly a big problem.</p><p>They were now walking by the beach. The smell of the sea embracing them and the breeze touching their skins. It felt amazing and relaxing and Lucas felt like he was exactly where he wanted to be and where he belonged, despite the long distance from home. He was with his three best friends, their laughs loud and full while they recorded something dumb for their Insta stories and Lucas stopped and sat on a stone bench and just looked around himself.</p><p>He was lucky to be here and he was more than grateful for it. Maybe spending vacations in a completely new place was exactly what he had been in need of without even realizing it.</p><p>\u201cYou alright, Lucas?\u201d Arthur asked, approaching him while Basile attempted to do a handstand in the middle of the sidewalk while Yann filmed it.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Lucas smiled at him. \u201cThis is great.\u201d</p><p>Arthur grinned, turned to look at the other two and his grin stretched a bit more.</p><p>\u201cIt really is.\u201d</p><p>They stood in silence for a few seconds. Arthur probably knew that Lucas was just taking everything in and processing what was around him, enjoying the peacefulness that was bathing them.</p><p>\u201cAre you guys coming?\u201d Yann called out.</p><p>Arthur turned to stare at Lucas with a raised eyebrow, a silent question.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Lucas answered, firstly only to Arthur and then louder so the other two could hear him. \u201cWe are.\u201d</p><p>They approached the place where the other two were, both bent over their phones, publishing the dumb videos they had made to their Insta stories. Lucas smiled and kicked Yann\u2019s shin playfully.</p><p>\u201cSo, any more plans for tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe could go to a club, I\u2019m sure we can find one easily,\u201d Basile suggested, already looking around for one.</p><p>\u201cWe only just got here and you already want to get into a club? You can do that back at home!\u201d Arthur argued.</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m sure clubs here are different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDifferent. Clubs are clubs, there are drinks and people and music. You really can\u2019t do that in many different ways.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill. Are you telling me that you come to the Galapagos and don\u2019t even want to go clubbing once while you\u2019re here?\u201d Basile sounded quite offended by that thought.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I\u2019m saying. I\u2019m just saying that this is our first night here, we could spend it in a different way and go clubbing tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m with Arthur on this,\u201d Yann interrupted before any of the two could say anything else. \u201cLucas might have slept the afternoon away, but I didn\u2019t and I don\u2019t know about you but I\u2019m tired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can just walk around for a little longer, maybe get ice cream, eat it on the beach, and then go back to the hotel and call it a night,\u201d Lucas said, hopping the suggestion was good enough for the three of them.</p><p>\u201cSounds good to me,\u201d Arthur shrugged.</p><p>Yann agreed quickly too and Basile, although still looking a little mad about not going to the club, followed them without complaining too much, only grabbing his phone and typing away with a small pout on his lips, before it quickly vanished into a smile, no doubt at the sight of a text from Daphn\u00e9.</p><p>If every night was like this one, and even though he would still be with his friends in Paris, it would be terribly hard to say goodbye to the Island and this trip.</p>",

Vacations cost money and money was something Lucas didn\u2019t have at his disposal, so it was never an option.</p><p>He was happy to spend his break from university with his friends and his mother and he didn\u2019t need to go somewhere abroad to have a good time. So, it wasn\u2019t like there was a deep desire to travel within him that came to life the days before every vacation.</p><p>Which didn\u2019t mean that he wouldn\u2019t accept the opportunity to go somewhere with open hands. In fact, he would accept it very quickly and be thankful for it. He just never thought it would happen.</p><p>But here he was. In front of the hotel where he and his three best friends would be staying for the next week. In Puerto Ayora, in the Santa Cruz Island, Galapagos.</p><p>It was a complete and unexpected change in scenery. And it was all, surprisingly, thanks to Basile, of all people.</p>[[MORE]]<p>If Lucas was being honest, he wasn\u2019t entirely sure how this even came to be. It had all started two months ago when Basile had been driving home after a date with Daphn\u00e9 and heard about a Christmas contest on the radio. In Basile\u2019s words, hearing it after spending time with his girlfriend was a sign of faith and he had to join in and try his luck. When he had gotten home that day and told Lucas, Arthur and Yann about it, the three of them had given him endless shit about it, joking about faith and destiny and powers.</p><p>But they had ended up eating their words. All their words. Because Basile had somehow won the contest and, with that, he had appeared home with four shiny tickets to Santa Cruz Island.</p><p>They kind of deserved all the teasing they had gotten from Basile and the threats of leaving them behind and taking Daphn\u00e9 with him that had come after that.</p><p>Of course, Basile being Basile had already told them that he wanted it to be a vacation for the gang and there wouldn\u2019t be any girls, \u2018or boys, Lucas\u2019, involved. That reassurance had toned down the fear of losing their opportunity to go to the Galapagos a bit. Just not enough to prevent them from doing Basile\u2019s chores for a whole two weeks without complaining.</p><p>It had been worth it, though. It had been worth it for the sun beating on their skin and the smell of the sea that was now enveloping them. For this, Lucas would do Basile\u2019s chores for a month.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Basile grinned at them, opening his arms wide. \u201cAm I the best or am I the best?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to admit,\u201d Arthur nodded, approvingly. \u201cJust this one time, you are the best.\u201d</p><p>Basile laughed and threw his arms around Lucas\u2019 and Arthur\u2019s shoulders, leading them into the hotel and yelling at Yann, who was walking behind them, to hurry up.</p><p>\u201cI would be faster if you guys would carry your own bags,\u201d Yann grumbled.</p><p>\u201cYou lost the bet, Yann,\u201d Lucas turned his head to grin teasingly at him. \u201cDeal with it.\u201d</p><p>They had made a bet while they were waiting for their plane at the airport back in Paris that the first person to fall asleep during the flight would have to carry all their bags from the cab to the hotel. Yann had been pretty confident that Arthur would be the one losing, but, in the end, he had spent nearly the whole flight sleeping and had actually been the first one to fall asleep.</p><p>\u201cIf you want help though,\u201d Arthur interrupted Lucas and Basile\u2019s laughs. \u201cJust say so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d Yann grunted, fixing the strap of the backpack he had on his shoulders. \u201cI got this. I\u2019m just glad none of us brought too much shit.\u201d</p><p>The hotel lobby was full of life when they entered, guests were talking and sitting on the sofas that were there and employees were walking around. A mix of different languages and accents could be heard and Lucas wondered if they were the only French people in the place or if they would meet anyone who had come from the same place.</p><p>The four of them walked further into the lobby, Arthur and Basile deciding they would be the ones doing the check-in and getting their room keys for them while Lucas and Yann found an empty sofa to sit on and wait.</p><p>Yann sighed, letting the bags drop to the floor and sitting down without a caring if there was something in them that could break and Lucas shook his head at him. Four backpacks and a suitcase didn\u2019t seem like much when he wasn\u2019t the one carrying them.</p><p>He let himself sit next to Yann and relax into the sofa. The air conditioning in the hotel lobby was a big improvement from the excessive heat outside and Lucas couldn\u2019t be more grateful for small mercies of modern times as he was right now.</p><p>He knew that December in the Galapagos Islands is supposed to be like June in France, which, technically, means warmer temperatures and the beginning of Summer. He knew that, but today was still a bit too hot to be considered normal. Global warming was laughing at them right now, no doubt.</p><p>He hoped that the temperature would drop a little in the next days. He did want it to be warm enough to enjoy their time there and go to the beach, but he didn\u2019t particularly want to melt into his towel while doing so.</p><p>\u201cCan you believe we\u2019re in the Galapagos?\u201d Yann asked him. \u201cAnd that we only had to pay for the hotel?\u201d</p><p>The contest had only given them the plane tickets, they had had to pay for the hotel and, of course, their meals and anything else they wanted. But the flights were the most expensive thing and Arthur had found a relatively cheap hotel for them. Even if it was a little bit more than Lucas would have liked to spend, sometimes it was good to indulge in a little treat for himself and it wasn\u2019t like it had been that much.</p><p>\u201cI think the most surprising thing is that Basile was the one who brought us here,\u201d he chuckled.</p><p>\u201cServes us right for making fun of him for entering a dumb radio contest,\u201d Yann said, amused to no end about what said \u2018dumb radio contest\u2019 Basile had entered did for them.</p><p>\u201cNot so dumb if it brought us to the Galapagos,\u201d Lucas shrugged, slapping Yann\u2019s back playfully. \u201cYou should try to join a contest for Easter. Maybe we\u2019ll be able to go to Dubai or something next.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do I have to be the one joining the contest?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not you?\u201d</p><p>Yann was just about to answer, with some biting remark no doubt, when Basile came up to them. He was jumping up and down a little too excitedly, but, to be fair, reasonably so. Lucas wouldn\u2019t make fun of him for it. Not this time, at least.</p><p>\u201cArthur is just getting the room keys, we can go up soon and then we can go explore,\u201d he rubbed his hands together.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if I wanna go anywhere today,\u201d Lucas shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m kinda tired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucas,\u201d Basile said while turning to Lucas and putting his hands on his shoulders, expression serious. \u201cI don\u2019t know if you noticed, but we\u2019re in Galapagos. Galapagos, Lucas. And you want to sleep?\u201d</p><p>Lucas rolled his eyes at Basile\u2019s over the top reaction.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me for being tired after a twenty-hour flight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care if you\u2019re tired. We\u2019re in Galapagos and we\u2019re going to enjoy it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can enjoy it tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy enjoy tomorrow what you can enjoy today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure that\u2019s how the saying goes-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got the keys,\u201d Arthur\u2019s voice interrupted their silly argument.</p><p>Basile yelled out, making some of the people in the lobby turn to stare at him, before snatching one of the keys from Arthur\u2019s hand and running to the elevators.</p><p>\u201cI wish I had that much energy,\u201d Lucas grumbled, grabbing his bag from where Yann had left it.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Lulu, you can rest a little while we\u2019re in the rooms and then we can go out later,\u201d Yann assured, putting a hand on Lucas\u2019 back and pushing him to where Arthur was scolding Basile while they waited for the elevator.</p><p>***</p><p>Yann had been right. All Lucas needed was a little rest before the adrenaline of being in the Galapagos really kicked in.</p><p>He was in a dreamy, warm place with his friends for the second half of his Christmas vacations. There really was nothing more he could ask for and, as much as he didn\u2019t like to admit it, Basile was right. It wasn\u2019t every day that they were in the Galapagos, they had to enjoy it as much as they could for the week they would be there. And Lucas would make sure to enjoy it as much as possible with the boys.</p><p>Yann had woken him up thirty minutes before they were supposed to leave for dinner, roughly pulling the blanket that had been covering him and almost yelling in his ear about warm weather and nice food. As annoyed as Lucas had been about it, he couldn\u2019t deny how much he actually wanted to go outside and experience the completely different place they were in.</p><p>However, considering he had been continuously telling Lucas to hurry up, Yann was now the one making them late and taking his sweet, sweet time in the bathroom.</p><p>Lucas had knocked on the door three times now and Basile had sent him over ten texts, all in caps lock, telling them they either hurried or him and Arthur would leave them behind. But there was really nothing much Lucas could do except stare out the window while waiting for Yann.</p><p>He could see the sea from there. There were people on the beach, people in the streets and the sun shining above all them. There were birds flying and a girl was walking her dog right in front of the hotel. He contemplated opening the window and letting the breeze coming from the sea into the room, but right when he was about to do that, the bathroom door finally opened and Yann walked out.</p><p>\u201cTook you long enough,\u201d Lucas raised an eyebrow while he pocketed his phone and grabbed the room key.</p><p>\u201cTaking care of yourself takes time, Lucas. You should try it sometime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Just hope Basile doesn\u2019t kill you and all that effort was for nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take my chances.\u201d</p><p>Lucas shook his head, laughing at Yann\u2019s completely laid back attitude and looked his friend up and down. He was now surer than ever about the reason why he had taken so long getting ready.</p><p>\u201cPlanning on bringing someone to our room tonight?\u201d He asked. \u201cBecause if you are, I want to know so I can go and room with Arthur and Basile.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not bringing anyone into our room, Lucas,\u201d he rolled his eyes, amused. \u201cI\u2019m not gonna kick my best friend out for a hookup.\u201d</p><p>Lucas hummed.</p><p>\u201cVery grateful for that.\u201d</p><p>They stepped out of the room and closed the door behind them, making sure the lights were turned off and that they had everything they needed on their pockets so that they wouldn\u2019t have to come back to the hotel earlier than expected.</p><p>\u201cNext time, please wake up earlier, Lucas,\u201d Arthur told him when they met at the lobby. \u201cI couldn\u2019t stand listening to Baz whine any longer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t my fault, alright? I was awake for a long time. Yann was the one getting all ready to find a lady tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I hope keeping us waiting will be worth it at the end of the night, then,\u201d Arthur shrugged before leading the way out of the hotel.</p><p>The evening wasn\u2019t too hot like Lucas had feared after the dreadful heat they had experienced when they had arrived. It was actually the perfect warmth to walk around comfortably and enjoy the view.</p><p>Puerto Ayora was a beautiful place, full of life and sounds and colours. Lucas didn\u2019t even know if he wanted to look at the people passing by, at the stores, at the sky or at the sea. Everything was calling his attention, screaming softly to be looked at.</p><p>\u201cBaz, I gotta say. This is amazing,\u201d he couldn\u2019t help but say, awe in his voice.</p><p>\u201cIt is, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Basile grinned at him, bumping their shoulders together, pride and excitement written all over his face.</p><p>\u201cYou can enter whatever contests you want to in the future and we won\u2019t even say anything,\u201d Yann promised.</p><p>\u201cNext time I win,\u201d Basile said as if it was already a sure thing that would happen without any doubts. \u201cI\u2019ll go on vacation with Daphn\u00e9, though. This time it was for us, but she\u2019s my girlfriend you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow sweet,\u201d Lucas said sarcastically.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Lulu, you\u2019ll understand one day. When you find your own Daphn\u00e9.\u201d</p><p>Lucas snorted.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I want to find a Daphn\u00e9, thanks,\u201d he clapped Basile on the back while Arthur and Yann sniggered next to them.</p><p>\u201cOr, you know, your male Daphn\u00e9.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy male Dahpn\u00e9?\u201dLucas raised an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Basile looked a little unsure but ready to go on with his idea. \u201cYou know-\u201d</p><p>\u201cBasile, buddy,\u201d Yann threw an arm around his shoulder. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s better if you don\u2019t even try to explain that one.\u201d</p><p>Basile blinked, before shrugging and almost pulling Yann with him in his hurry to get to the restaurant he had just seen.</p><p>To be fair, Lucas was hungry too and he also couldn\u2019t wait to get somewhere where they could finally eat something since they hadn\u2019t really had any real food since their flight.</p><p>***</p><p>Their dinner had been great. Maybe a little too expensive for them, they would surely have to find a more suited place for the money they had in the next days. They would have time for that when they do some exploring of the city, a meal at a more expensive restaurant was hardly a big problem.</p><p>They were now walking by the beach. The smell of the sea embracing them and the breeze touching their skins. It felt amazing and relaxing and Lucas felt like he was exactly where he wanted to be and where he belonged, despite the long distance from home. He was with his three best friends, their laughs loud and full while they recorded something dumb for their Insta stories and Lucas stopped and sat on a stone bench and just looked around himself.</p><p>He was lucky to be here and he was more than grateful for it. Maybe spending vacations in a completely new place was exactly what he had been in need of without even realizing it.</p><p>\u201cYou alright, Lucas?\u201d Arthur asked, approaching him while Basile attempted to do a handstand in the middle of the sidewalk while Yann filmed it.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Lucas smiled at him. \u201cThis is great.\u201d</p><p>Arthur grinned, turned to look at the other two and his grin stretched a bit more.</p><p>\u201cIt really is.\u201d</p><p>They stood in silence for a few seconds. Arthur probably knew that Lucas was just taking everything in and processing what was around him, enjoying the peacefulness that was bathing them.</p><p>\u201cAre you guys coming?\u201d Yann called out.</p><p>Arthur turned to stare at Lucas with a raised eyebrow, a silent question.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Lucas answered, firstly only to Arthur and then louder so the other two could hear him. \u201cWe are.\u201d</p><p>They approached the place where the other two were, both bent over their phones, publishing the dumb videos they had made to their Insta stories. Lucas smiled and kicked Yann\u2019s shin playfully.</p><p>\u201cSo, any more plans for tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe could go to a club, I\u2019m sure we can find one easily,\u201d Basile suggested, already looking around for one.</p><p>\u201cWe only just got here and you already want to get into a club? You can do that back at home!\u201d Arthur argued.</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m sure clubs here are different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDifferent. Clubs are clubs, there are drinks and people and music. You really can\u2019t do that in many different ways.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill. Are you telling me that you come to the Galapagos and don\u2019t even want to go clubbing once while you\u2019re here?\u201d Basile sounded quite offended by that thought.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I\u2019m saying. I\u2019m just saying that this is our first night here, we could spend it in a different way and go clubbing tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m with Arthur on this,\u201d Yann interrupted before any of the two could say anything else. \u201cLucas might have slept the afternoon away, but I didn\u2019t and I don\u2019t know about you but I\u2019m tired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can just walk around for a little longer, maybe get ice cream, eat it on the beach, and then go back to the hotel and call it a night,\u201d Lucas said, hopping the suggestion was good enough for the three of them.</p><p>\u201cSounds good to me,\u201d Arthur shrugged.</p><p>Yann agreed quickly too and Basile, although still looking a little mad about not going to the club, followed them without complaining too much, only grabbing his phone and typing away with a small pout on his lips, before it quickly vanished into a smile, no doubt at the sight of a text from Daphn\u00e9.</p><p>If every night was like this one, and even though he would still be with his friends in Paris, it would be terribly hard to say goodbye to the Island and this trip.</p>",
                "content": "<p><b>Summary:&nbsp;</b><i>&ldquo;Can you believe we&rsquo;re in the Galapagos?&rdquo; Yann asked him. &ldquo;And that we only had to pay for the hotel?&rdquo;</i></p><p>Or, the one where Basile wins plane tickets to the Galapagos and takes his three friends with him for a one week vacation; there Lucas meets Eliott and, suddenly, one week doesn&rsquo;t seem like enough time.</p><p><b>Words: </b>3k</p><p>can also be read on my ao3 @ invisible_slytherin</p><p>Spending his Christmas or any other of his vacations outside of Paris was something Lucas, as a broke university student, never thought would happen.</p><p>It didn&rsquo;t seem plausible. Vacations cost money and money was something Lucas didn&rsquo;t have at his disposal, so it was never an option.</p><p>He was happy to spend his break from university with his friends and his mother and he didn&rsquo;t need to go somewhere abroad to have a good time. So, it wasn&rsquo;t like there was a deep desire to travel within him that came to life the days before every vacation.</p><p>Which didn&rsquo;t mean that he wouldn&rsquo;t accept the opportunity to go somewhere with open hands. In fact, he would accept it very quickly and be thankful for it. He just never thought it would happen.</p><p>But here he was. In front of the hotel where he and his three best friends would be staying for the next week. In Puerto Ayora, in the Santa Cruz Island, Galapagos.</p><p>It was a complete and unexpected change in scenery. And it was all, surprisingly, thanks to Basile, of all people.</p><p>If Lucas was being honest, he wasn&rsquo;t entirely sure how this even came to be. It had all started two months ago when Basile had been driving home after a date with Daphn&eacute; and heard about a Christmas contest on the radio. In Basile&rsquo;s words, hearing it after spending time with his girlfriend was a sign of faith and he had to join in and try his luck. When he had gotten home that day and told Lucas, Arthur and Yann about it, the three of them had given him endless shit about it, joking about faith and destiny and powers.</p><p>But they had ended up eating their words. All their words. Because Basile had somehow won the contest and, with that, he had appeared home with four shiny tickets to Santa Cruz Island.</p><p>They kind of deserved all the teasing they had gotten from Basile and the threats of leaving them behind and taking Daphn&eacute; with him that had come after that.</p><p>Of course, Basile being Basile had already told them that he wanted it to be a vacation for the gang and there wouldn&rsquo;t be any girls, &lsquo;or boys, Lucas&rsquo;, involved. That reassurance had toned down the fear of losing their opportunity to go to the Galapagos a bit. Just not enough to prevent them from doing Basile&rsquo;s chores for a whole two weeks without complaining.</p><p>It had been worth it, though. It had been worth it for the sun beating on their skin and the smell of the sea that was now enveloping them. For this, Lucas would do Basile&rsquo;s chores for a month.</p><p>&ldquo;So,&rdquo; Basile grinned at them, opening his arms wide. &ldquo;Am I the best or am I the best?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I have to admit,&rdquo; Arthur nodded, approvingly. &ldquo;Just this one time, you are the best.&rdquo;</p><p>Basile laughed and threw his arms around Lucas&rsquo; and Arthur&rsquo;s shoulders, leading them into the hotel and yelling at Yann, who was walking behind them, to hurry up.</p><p>&ldquo;I would be faster if you guys would carry your own bags,&rdquo; Yann grumbled.</p><p>&ldquo;You lost the bet, Yann,&rdquo; Lucas turned his head to grin teasingly at him. &ldquo;Deal with it.&rdquo;</p><p>They had made a bet while they were waiting for their plane at the airport back in Paris that the first person to fall asleep during the flight would have to carry all their bags from the cab to the hotel. Yann had been pretty confident that Arthur would be the one losing, but, in the end, he had spent nearly the whole flight sleeping and had actually been the first one to fall asleep.</p><p>&ldquo;If you want help though,&rdquo; Arthur interrupted Lucas and Basile&rsquo;s laughs. &ldquo;Just say so.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry,&rdquo; Yann grunted, fixing the strap of the backpack he had on his shoulders. &ldquo;I got this. I&rsquo;m just glad none of us brought too much shit.&rdquo;</p><p>The hotel lobby was full of life when they entered, guests were talking and sitting on the sofas that were there and employees were walking around. A mix of different languages and accents could be heard and Lucas wondered if they were the only French people in the place or if they would meet anyone who had come from the same place.</p><p>The four of them walked further into the lobby, Arthur and Basile deciding they would be the ones doing the check-in and getting their room keys for them while Lucas and Yann found an empty sofa to sit on and wait.</p><p>Yann sighed, letting the bags drop to the floor and sitting down without a caring if there was something in them that could break and Lucas shook his head at him. Four backpacks and a suitcase didn&rsquo;t seem like much when he wasn&rsquo;t the one carrying them.</p><p>He let himself sit next to Yann and relax into the sofa. The air conditioning in the hotel lobby was a big improvement from the excessive heat outside and Lucas couldn&rsquo;t be more grateful for small mercies of modern times as he was right now.</p><p>He knew that December in the Galapagos Islands is supposed to be like June in France, which, technically, means warmer temperatures and the beginning of Summer. He knew that, but today was still a bit too hot to be considered normal. Global warming was laughing at them right now, no doubt.</p><p>He hoped that the temperature would drop a little in the next days. He did want it to be warm enough to enjoy their time there and go to the beach, but he didn&rsquo;t particularly want to melt into his towel while doing so.</p><p>&ldquo;Can you believe we&rsquo;re in the Galapagos?&rdquo; Yann asked him. &ldquo;And that we only had to pay for the hotel?&rdquo;</p><p>The contest had only given them the plane tickets, they had had to pay for the hotel and, of course, their meals and anything else they wanted. But the flights were the most expensive thing and Arthur had found a relatively cheap hotel for them. Even if it was a little bit more than Lucas would have liked to spend, sometimes it was good to indulge in a little treat for himself and it wasn&rsquo;t like it had been that much.</p><p>&ldquo;I think the most surprising thing is that Basile was the one who brought us here,&rdquo; he chuckled.</p><p>&ldquo;Serves us right for making fun of him for entering a dumb radio contest,&rdquo; Yann said, amused to no end about what said &lsquo;dumb radio contest&rsquo; Basile had entered did for them.</p><p>&ldquo;Not so dumb if it brought us to the Galapagos,&rdquo; Lucas shrugged, slapping Yann&rsquo;s back playfully. &ldquo;You should try to join a contest for Easter. Maybe we&rsquo;ll be able to go to Dubai or something next.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why do I have to be the one joining the contest?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why not you?&rdquo;</p><p>Yann was just about to answer, with some biting remark no doubt, when Basile came up to them. He was jumping up and down a little too excitedly, but, to be fair, reasonably so. Lucas wouldn&rsquo;t make fun of him for it. Not this time, at least.</p><p>&ldquo;Arthur is just getting the room keys, we can go up soon and then we can go explore,&rdquo; he rubbed his hands together.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if I wanna go anywhere today,&rdquo; Lucas shook his head. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m kinda tired.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Lucas,&rdquo; Basile said while turning to Lucas and putting his hands on his shoulders, expression serious. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if you noticed, but we&rsquo;re in Galapagos. Galapagos, Lucas. And you want to sleep?&rdquo;</p><p>Lucas rolled his eyes at Basile&rsquo;s over the top reaction.</p><p>&ldquo;Excuse me for being tired after a twenty-hour flight.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care if you&rsquo;re tired. We&rsquo;re in Galapagos and we&rsquo;re going to enjoy it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We can enjoy it tomorrow.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why enjoy tomorrow what you can enjoy today.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure that&rsquo;s how the saying goes-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I got the keys,&rdquo; Arthur&rsquo;s voice interrupted their silly argument.</p><p>Basile yelled out, making some of the people in the lobby turn to stare at him, before snatching one of the keys from Arthur&rsquo;s hand and running to the elevators.</p><p>&ldquo;I wish I had that much energy,&rdquo; Lucas grumbled, grabbing his bag from where Yann had left it.</p><p>&ldquo;Come on, Lulu, you can rest a little while we&rsquo;re in the rooms and then we can go out later,&rdquo; Yann assured, putting a hand on Lucas&rsquo; back and pushing him to where Arthur was scolding Basile while they waited for the elevator.</p><p>***</p><p>Yann had been right. All Lucas needed was a little rest before the adrenaline of being in the Galapagos really kicked in.</p><p>He was in a dreamy, warm place with his friends for the second half of his Christmas vacations. There really was nothing more he could ask for and, as much as he didn&rsquo;t like to admit it, Basile was right. It wasn&rsquo;t every day that they were in the Galapagos, they had to enjoy it as much as they could for the week they would be there. And Lucas would make sure to enjoy it as much as possible with the boys.</p><p>Yann had woken him up thirty minutes before they were supposed to leave for dinner, roughly pulling the blanket that had been covering him and almost yelling in his ear about warm weather and nice food. As annoyed as Lucas had been about it, he couldn&rsquo;t deny how much he actually wanted to go outside and experience the completely different place they were in.</p><p>However, considering he had been continuously telling Lucas to hurry up, Yann was now the one making them late and taking his sweet, sweet time in the bathroom.</p><p>Lucas had knocked on the door three times now and Basile had sent him over ten texts, all in caps lock, telling them they either hurried or him and Arthur would leave them behind. But there was really nothing much Lucas could do except stare out the window while waiting for Yann.</p><p>He could see the sea from there. There were people on the beach, people in the streets and the sun shining above all them. There were birds flying and a girl was walking her dog right in front of the hotel. He contemplated opening the window and letting the breeze coming from the sea into the room, but right when he was about to do that, the bathroom door finally opened and Yann walked out.</p><p>&ldquo;Took you long enough,&rdquo; Lucas raised an eyebrow while he pocketed his phone and grabbed the room key.</p><p>&ldquo;Taking care of yourself takes time, Lucas. You should try it sometime.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sure. Just hope Basile doesn&rsquo;t kill you and all that effort was for nothing.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take my chances.&rdquo;</p><p>Lucas shook his head, laughing at Yann&rsquo;s completely laid back attitude and looked his friend up and down. He was now surer than ever about the reason why he had taken so long getting ready.</p><p>&ldquo;Planning on bringing someone to our room tonight?&rdquo; He asked. &ldquo;Because if you are, I want to know so I can go and room with Arthur and Basile.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not bringing anyone into our room, Lucas,&rdquo; he rolled his eyes, amused. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not gonna kick my best friend out for a hookup.&rdquo;</p><p>Lucas hummed.</p><p>&ldquo;Very grateful for that.&rdquo;</p><p>They stepped out of the room and closed the door behind them, making sure the lights were turned off and that they had everything they needed on their pockets so that they wouldn&rsquo;t have to come back to the hotel earlier than expected.</p><p>&ldquo;Next time, please wake up earlier, Lucas,&rdquo; Arthur told him when they met at the lobby. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t stand listening to Baz whine any longer.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t my fault, alright? I was awake for a long time. Yann was the one getting all ready to find a lady tonight.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I hope keeping us waiting will be worth it at the end of the night, then,&rdquo; Arthur shrugged before leading the way out of the hotel.</p><p>The evening wasn&rsquo;t too hot like Lucas had feared after the dreadful heat they had experienced when they had arrived. It was actually the perfect warmth to walk around comfortably and enjoy the view.</p><p>Puerto Ayora was a beautiful place, full of life and sounds and colours. Lucas didn&rsquo;t even know if he wanted to look at the people passing by, at the stores, at the sky or at the sea. Everything was calling his attention, screaming softly to be looked at.</p><p>&ldquo;Baz, I gotta say. This is amazing,&rdquo; he couldn&rsquo;t help but say, awe in his voice.</p><p>&ldquo;It is, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; Basile grinned at him, bumping their shoulders together, pride and excitement written all over his face.</p><p>&ldquo;You can enter whatever contests you want to in the future and we won&rsquo;t even say anything,&rdquo; Yann promised.</p><p>&ldquo;Next time I win,&rdquo; Basile said as if it was already a sure thing that would happen without any doubts. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go on vacation with Daphn&eacute;, though. This time it was for us, but she&rsquo;s my girlfriend you know.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How sweet,&rdquo; Lucas said sarcastically.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, Lulu, you&rsquo;ll understand one day. When you find your own Daphn&eacute;.&rdquo;</p><p>Lucas snorted.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I want to find a Daphn&eacute;, thanks,&rdquo; he clapped Basile on the back while Arthur and Yann sniggered next to them.</p><p>&ldquo;Or, you know, your male Daphn&eacute;.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;My male Dahpn&eacute;?&rdquo;Lucas raised an eyebrow.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; Basile looked a little unsure but ready to go on with his idea. &ldquo;You know-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Basile, buddy,&rdquo; Yann threw an arm around his shoulder. &ldquo;Maybe it&rsquo;s better if you don&rsquo;t even try to explain that one.&rdquo;</p><p>Basile blinked, before shrugging and almost pulling Yann with him in his hurry to get to the restaurant he had just seen.</p><p>To be fair, Lucas was hungry too and he also couldn&rsquo;t wait to get somewhere where they could finally eat something since they hadn&rsquo;t really had any real food since their flight.</p><p>***</p><p>Their dinner had been great. Maybe a little too expensive for them, they would surely have to find a more suited place for the money they had in the next days. They would have time for that when they do some exploring of the city, a meal at a more expensive restaurant was hardly a big problem.</p><p>They were now walking by the beach. The smell of the sea embracing them and the breeze touching their skins. It felt amazing and relaxing and Lucas felt like he was exactly where he wanted to be and where he belonged, despite the long distance from home. He was with his three best friends, their laughs loud and full while they recorded something dumb for their Insta stories and Lucas stopped and sat on a stone bench and just looked around himself.</p><p>He was lucky to be here and he was more than grateful for it.

        "answer": "<p><b><i>5. Wait a minute. Are you jealous?\u00a0</i></b></p><p><b><i>13. Kiss me.</i></b></p><p>It\u2019s not like Lucas was <i>jealous</i>, he just really wanted to go home - specifically with Eliott, and as soon as humanly possible would be the preferred rate of speed at which everything would occur. The party they were at had been decent enough - a little too crowded and the music was way too quiet, but there was plenty to drink in case you wanted to forget about the events of the night. Usually, Lucas would be one of the first people to run off into the kitchen in order to get an early start on drinking. Tonight, however, was a little different. Lucas didn\u2019t want to get drunk tonight - Eliott had been drinking a little and so Lucas wanted to be sober to balance everything out, just like Eliott would do for him most of the time - and so he sat on the couch pretending to scroll through Instagram for the 4th time this night. The posts on his explore page were dull and his feed kept displaying the same posts over and over again. <i>Okay, I need to do something better with my time</i>. He got up, feeling a harsh shoulder crash into his as someone immediately brushed past him in order to take his spot, as he began wandering aimlessly through the house. It didn\u2019t take him long to find his beaming, drunk boyfriend talking someone\u2019s ear off about God-knows-what. </p><p>Eliott was up and having fun with any and everyone who even so happened to look in his direction. It was something that Eliott usually wouldn\u2019t do - he tended to keep only to the people he knew - but he was a little more relaxed tonight, and so he had no problem making small talk with strangers. Eliott had drank a few beers with Idriss earlier, and that had helped him to feel confident enough to go up to people and begin talking and dancing and having the kind of night that Lucas wished he were having. He couldn\u2019t help but close his eyes at the sight - he had no right to be jealous of Eliott having a good time. All things considered, this should be rendered a miracle. Eliott almost always stuck like glue to Lucas\u2019s side at most events - not that Lucas found it to be anything but endearing. They would go to a party and Eliott would dance behind Lucas for the entirety of the event. If Lucas and the boys decided to go out at the very last minute, Eliott would often either stay home or hang out with his own friends rather than hitting the town. He kept to himself most times, and so Lucas tried to see tonight\u2019s events as something to be proud of. <i>If he weren\u2019t drunk that\u2019d probably be better, but I guess this is okay for now.</i></p><p>And that was the other thing bothering Lucas - the primary thing that he couldn\u2019t shake off. He knew that Eliott shouldn\u2019t drink - that it could mess with certain medications he was taking - and so when he found out that Eliott had been drinking with Idriss earlier, he didn\u2019t think twice before reacting.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want or need a monitor, Lucas!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a monitor! I\u2019m just looking out for you!\u201d </p><p>Eliott rolled his eyes, which made Lucas flare his nostrils and bite the inside of his cheek with so much pressure that he nearly broke skin. \u201cSo you\u2019re allowed to get piss drunk but not me?\u201d He scoffed. \u201cSounds fair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not-\u201c Lucas stopped himself, pinched the bridge of his nose, and ran a hand through his hair before continuing. \u201cIt\u2019s not the same. You told me that yourself.\u201d </p><p>The next thing he knew, Eliott was storming off and muttering something along the lines of Lucas being unfair, and him wanting to live a normal life and get drunk like anybody else, and how Lucas was becoming another version of Lucille. Lucas took the insults as they came and tried not to let it sting as he stood around near the couch and let Eliott roam free. <i>He doesn\u2019t want me there? So be it.</i></p><p>But then Lucas saw something in front of him that he almost couldn\u2019t process, and suddenly he didn\u2019t care about Eliott\u2019s harsh words from earlier. It seemed to happen in slow motion: Eliott talking to some girl in the corner of the room, her putting her hand on his arm and gently moving it up and down, him laughing at something she was saying. It was all a bit too close for comfort. Now, it\u2019s not that Lucas was jealous - nothing <i>had happened </i>after all - it was just that he\u2019d prefer if the scene weren\u2019t happening right in front of him, as though it were an act that only he was invited to see. It made him feel sick, almost as if he were the one who had been drinking all night. </p><p>His legs moved before he could register what he was going to do once he actually got to him. He found himself wrapping his arms around Eliott\u2019s waist, crudely interrupting whatever conversation was happening in front of him. He expected rejection - for Eliott to shrug him off and make a comment about their fight earlier - but rejection never came. He felt Eliott ease comfortably into his arms. Lucas felt his stomach do flips.</p><p>\u201cHey baby, I\u2019m kind of tired.\u201d He spoke lowly, but loud enough for the girl to hear him. \u201cOh, who\u2019s your friend?\u201d He smiled and removed one of his arms from around Eliott\u2019s waist in order to extend it out towards her. She smiled tightly but didn\u2019t take his hand. </p><p>\u201cI was just about to leave, actually,\u201d She lies. \u201cNice meeting you, Eliott.\u201d \u00a0</p><p>Lucas smiles against Eliott\u2019s back at the small victory. He feels Eliott shuffle in order to turn around and face him. He promptly slings his arms around Lucas\u2019s shoulders and gives him a look, raising his eyebrows and pouting a little. \u201cWhat was that all about?\u201d He asks, a hint of playfulness in his voice.</p><p>\u201cNothing, I\u2019m just tired.\u201d Lucas can feel that his face is burning and flushed red. He\u2019d never been great at lying to Eliott. </p><p>\u201cMhm, just tired. Sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEliott\u2026\u201d Lucas whines.</p><p>Something akin to realization washes over Eliott\u2019s entire face. \u201cWait a minute,\u201d He reaches up to tuck a stray piece of hair behind Lucas\u2019s ear before linking his hands behind his neck again. \u201cAre you jealous?\u201d </p><p>Lucas rolls his eyes. \u201cNo.\u201d </p><p>\u201cLucas, we don\u2019t lie to each other.\u201d The playfulness returns to his voice, and Lucas can\u2019t help but thump his head against Eliott\u2019s chest as he gives in.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d He groans against Eliott\u2019s shirt. \u201cWe were fighting earlier and then I saw you with her and I just\u2026\u201d He looks back up at Eliott, who is looking down at him with nothing but admiration in his eyes. \u201cI overreacted.\u201d </p><p>Eliott kisses the tip of Lucas\u2019s nose, followed by both cheeks, before he leans back. \u201cI\u2019m not mad about earlier. I mean, I <i>was</i>, but I get where you were coming from.\u201d Lucas looks like he wants to say something, but Eliott continues. \u201cAnd you didn\u2019t have to worry about her, Lucas. I love you too much to do that to us.\u201d </p><p>Lucas silently curses at himself when he feels hot tears take up residence in his eyes. Another thing he\u2019d never been great at: receiving compliments from Eliott. He furiously attempts to blink them away, biting roughly at his lower lip. \u201cI love you, too.\u201d</p><p>Eliott nods and brings his hands around to cup Lucas\u2019s face between them. \u201cKiss me.\u201d</p><p>Lucas doesn\u2019t need to be told twice.</p>",

I\u2019m just looking out for you!\u201d </p><p>Eliott rolled his eyes, which made Lucas flare his nostrils and bite the inside of his cheek with so much pressure that he nearly broke skin. \u201cSo you\u2019re allowed to get piss drunk but not me?\u201d He scoffed. \u201cSounds fair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not-\u201c Lucas stopped himself, pinched the bridge of his nose, and ran a hand through his hair before continuing. \u201cIt\u2019s not the same. You told me that yourself.\u201d </p><p>The next thing he knew, Eliott was storming off and muttering something along the lines of Lucas being unfair, and him wanting to live a normal life and get drunk like anybody else, and how Lucas was becoming another version of Lucille. Lucas took the insults as they came and tried not to let it sting as he stood around near the couch and let Eliott roam free. <i>He doesn\u2019t want me there? So be it.</i></p><p>But then Lucas saw something in front of him that he almost couldn\u2019t process, and suddenly he didn\u2019t care about Eliott\u2019s harsh words from earlier. It seemed to happen in slow motion: Eliott talking to some girl in the corner of the room, her putting her hand on his arm and gently moving it up and down, him laughing at something she was saying. It was all a bit too close for comfort. Now, it\u2019s not that Lucas was jealous - nothing <i>had happened </i>after all - it was just that he\u2019d prefer if the scene weren\u2019t happening right in front of him, as though it were an act that only he was invited to see. It made him feel sick, almost as if he were the one who had been drinking all night. </p><p>His legs moved before he could register what he was going to do once he actually got to him. He found himself wrapping his arms around Eliott\u2019s waist, crudely interrupting whatever conversation was happening in front of him. He expected rejection - for Eliott to shrug him off and make a comment about their fight earlier - but rejection never came. He felt Eliott ease comfortably into his arms. Lucas felt his stomach do flips.</p><p>\u201cHey baby, I\u2019m kind of tired.\u201d He spoke lowly, but loud enough for the girl to hear him. \u201cOh, who\u2019s your friend?\u201d He smiled and removed one of his arms from around Eliott\u2019s waist in order to extend it out towards her. She smiled tightly but didn\u2019t take his hand. </p><p>\u201cI was just about to leave, actually,\u201d She lies. \u201cNice meeting you, Eliott.\u201d \u00a0</p><p>Lucas smiles against Eliott\u2019s back at the small victory. He feels Eliott shuffle in order to turn around and face him. He promptly slings his arms around Lucas\u2019s shoulders and gives him a look, raising his eyebrows and pouting a little. \u201cWhat was that all about?\u201d He asks, a hint of playfulness in his voice.</p><p>\u201cNothing, I\u2019m just tired.\u201d Lucas can feel that his face is burning and flushed red. He\u2019d never been great at lying to Eliott. </p><p>\u201cMhm, just tired. Sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEliott\u2026\u201d Lucas whines.</p><p>Something akin to realization washes over Eliott\u2019s entire face. \u201cWait a minute,\u201d He reaches up to tuck a stray piece of hair behind Lucas\u2019s ear before linking his hands behind his neck again. \u201cAre you jealous?\u201d </p><p>Lucas rolls his eyes. \u201cNo.\u201d </p><p>\u201cLucas, we don\u2019t lie to each other.\u201d The playfulness returns to his voice, and Lucas can\u2019t help but thump his head against Eliott\u2019s chest as he gives in.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d He groans against Eliott\u2019s shirt. \u201cWe were fighting earlier and then I saw you with her and I just\u2026\u201d He looks back up at Eliott, who is looking down at him with nothing but admiration in his eyes. \u201cI overreacted.\u201d </p><p>Eliott kisses the tip of Lucas\u2019s nose, followed by both cheeks, before he leans back. \u201cI\u2019m not mad about earlier. I mean, I <i>was</i>, but I get where you were coming from.\u201d Lucas looks like he wants to say something, but Eliott continues. \u201cAnd you didn\u2019t have to worry about her, Lucas. I love you too much to do that to us.\u201d </p><p>Lucas silently curses at himself when he feels hot tears take up residence in his eyes. Another thing he\u2019d never been great at: receiving compliments from Eliott. He furiously attempts to blink them away, biting roughly at his lower lip. \u201cI love you, too.\u201d</p><p>Eliott nods and brings his hands around to cup Lucas\u2019s face between them. \u201cKiss me.\u201d</p><p>Lucas doesn\u2019t need to be told twice.</p>",
                "content": "<p><b><i>5. Wait a minute. Are you jealous?&nbsp;</i></b></p><p><b><i>13. Kiss me.</i></b></p><p>It&rsquo;s not like Lucas was <i>jealous</i>, he just really wanted to go home - specifically with Eliott, and as soon as humanly possible would be the preferred rate of speed at which everything would occur. The party they were at had been decent enough - a little too crowded and the music was way too quiet, but there was plenty to drink in case you wanted to forget about the events of the night. Usually, Lucas would be one of the first people to run off into the kitchen in order to get an early start on drinking. Tonight, however, was a little different. Lucas didn&rsquo;t want to get drunk tonight - Eliott had been drinking a little and so Lucas wanted to be sober to balance everything out, just like Eliott would do for him most of the time - and so he sat on the couch pretending to scroll through Instagram for the 4th time this night. The posts on his explore page were dull and his feed kept displaying the same posts over and over again. <i>Okay, I need to do something better with my time</i>. He got up, feeling a harsh shoulder crash into his as someone immediately brushed past him in order to take his spot, as he began wandering aimlessly through the house. It didn&rsquo;t take him long to find his beaming, drunk boyfriend talking someone&rsquo;s ear off about God-knows-what. </p><p>Eliott was up and having fun with any and everyone who even so happened to look in his direction. It was something that Eliott usually wouldn&rsquo;t do - he tended to keep only to the people he knew - but he was a little more relaxed tonight, and so he had no problem making small talk with strangers. Eliott had drank a few beers with Idriss earlier, and that had helped him to feel confident enough to go up to people and begin talking and dancing and having the kind of night that Lucas wished he were having. He couldn&rsquo;t help but close his eyes at the sight - he had no right to be jealous of Eliott having a good time. All things considered, this should be rendered a miracle. Eliott almost always stuck like glue to Lucas&rsquo;s side at most events - not that Lucas found it to be anything but endearing. They would go to a party and Eliott would dance behind Lucas for the entirety of the event. If Lucas and the boys decided to go out at the very last minute, Eliott would often either stay home or hang out with his own friends rather than hitting the town. He kept to himself most times, and so Lucas tried to see tonight&rsquo;s events as something to be proud of. <i>If he weren&rsquo;t drunk that&rsquo;d probably be better, but I guess this is okay for now.</i></p><p>And that was the other thing bothering Lucas - the primary thing that he couldn&rsquo;t shake off.
