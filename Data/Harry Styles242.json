        "question": "How does harry liliths affect him? I need to know",
        "answer": "<p>Okay, so.. there are several Liliths to choose from in astrology. Assuming you mean the one that most people see on astro.com under the additional objects, that would be the Mean Black Moon Lilith (can also be found as h21, though will be in a slightly different position because while it\u2019s the same thing, it\u2019s calculated from a different vantage point.). There is also an asteroid Lilith (asteroid 1181), as well as a Dark Moon Lilith (reference point is numbered as h58 on astro.com, and is a hypothetical \u201csecond moon\u201d for earth, that some people think they\u2019ve seen, but it hasn\u2019t been confirmed, so I don\u2019t use it) and a True Black Moon Lilith (reference number is h13, different from Mean Black Moon Lilith because True is the exact celestial point in the galaxy of the moon\u2019s orbit only happening twice per month, farthest away from earth, thus the word\u00a0\u201ctrue\u201d. Mean is a celestial point based on averages.) I prefer Mean Lilith because it seems to be the most accurate, in my opinion.</p><p>If you are still with me, good job!</p><p>In Biblical lore Lilith was Adam\u2019s first wife, formed from the same clay as Adam after God created Adam and then Adam decided he needed a companion. After time, Adam and Lilith began to disagree on the fact that Adam should be the dominant figure, when Lilith believed they should be seen as total equals. She ran to the edge of the Red Sea and became a demon, mated with and had the children of demons. Adam decided he wanted Lilith back, so God sent angels to collect her. She didn\u2019t want to leave, so the angels killed her children. She decided to take revenge out on humanity, and began sleeping with men, and killing human children. God then created Eve, who took on the role of Adam\u2019s wife, and Lilith was mostly forgotten. She represents and has been used as a warning of strong willed women throughout history and the repercussions of basically not knowing \u201ctheir place\u201d. In astrology, she represents the wild, dark, wounded side of nature (though not the same as Chiron, the wounded healer).\u00a0</p><p>We\u2019re going to use the glyph version that is most heavily used on astro.com, under objects simply called Lilith, and again, this is the Mean Black Moon Lilith (MBML) for this interpretation.</p><p>Harry\u2019s MBML is at 22 degrees of the sign of Aries, in his 6th house. This would make Harry someone who likes a challenge and is a bit of a perfectionist. He wouldn\u2019t\u00a0like to be seen as weak or vulnerable very often. It makes him fiercely independent and someone who stands up for just causes. He\u2019s not afraid to use his sexuality in his career to get ahead, and he\u2019s also a really, really hard worker. In fact, much of the time he probably uses work as an outlet for his keyed up sexual energy. Down time is probably pretty hard for him, as he needs to be moving and doing things and feeling productive. This placement makes him very restless.\u00a0 He probably has a bit of a healing touch, physically.\u00a0</p><p>Harry was probably the quietest in terms of the treatment from his previous management with One Direction, but he was also probably the most used member of the band. Someone with this placement can be easily taken advantage of by higher-ups, so much so that there is a need to break free and become your own boss. I\u2019ve heard that it was Harry\u2019s idea for the band to take a break, and it\u2019s understandable with this placement. 6th house placements produce a need to please and it probably caused him constant anxiety that he was being used as much as he likely was, thus prompting him to break free. Good for him, I say. The band may have given him everything, and it\u2019s obvious he\u2019s grateful, but it was also terrible for his health.\u00a0Sharing and partnerships can be a struggle for people with this placement, at least on a daily basis. They need space from anything resembling control over them from time to time, to recharge.\u00a0</p><p>Harry has probably realized at this point that he will always be in the service of other people. Someone who has this placement in Aries may have a hard time accepting this, and at times can feel caged by the realization, however the fact that this placement resides in an earth house can help and hinder that fact, both at the same time. The help comes from the fact that the earth environment of this placement can lessen the heat of Aries, so that the selfishness of the placement doesn\u2019t grow out of control. The hinder comes from the fact that such a selfish placement is forced to serve others, being that it\u2019s in the 6th house. It will be a constant struggle, but should be made easier by the fact that he is, at this time at least, seemingly in control of his own affairs and that he has a career that he genuinely seems to love.\u00a0</p><p>This is a placement of a lover that is very sensual, very passionate. Someone who all at once wants to take in sexual situations, while also wanting to give. This placement is in opposition to his rising, so I can see it causing a bit of awkwardness to his already slightly awkward personality. There would definitely be a lot of push and pull in his personality that can make people uncertain of where he\u2019s going to come from next. Especially since he\u2019s got so much Aquarius in his chart.\u00a0</p>",

After time, Adam and Lilith began to disagree on the fact that Adam should be the dominant figure, when Lilith believed they should be seen as total equals. She ran to the edge of the Red Sea and became a demon, mated with and had the children of demons. Adam decided he wanted Lilith back, so God sent angels to collect her. She didn\u2019t want to leave, so the angels killed her children. She decided to take revenge out on humanity, and began sleeping with men, and killing human children. God then created Eve, who took on the role of Adam\u2019s wife, and Lilith was mostly forgotten. She represents and has been used as a warning of strong willed women throughout history and the repercussions of basically not knowing \u201ctheir place\u201d. In astrology, she represents the wild, dark, wounded side of nature (though not the same as Chiron, the wounded healer).\u00a0</p><p>We\u2019re going to use the glyph version that is most heavily used on astro.com, under objects simply called Lilith, and again, this is the Mean Black Moon Lilith (MBML) for this interpretation.</p><p>Harry\u2019s MBML is at 22 degrees of the sign of Aries, in his 6th house. This would make Harry someone who likes a challenge and is a bit of a perfectionist. He wouldn\u2019t\u00a0like to be seen as weak or vulnerable very often. It makes him fiercely independent and someone who stands up for just causes. He\u2019s not afraid to use his sexuality in his career to get ahead, and he\u2019s also a really, really hard worker. In fact, much of the time he probably uses work as an outlet for his keyed up sexual energy. Down time is probably pretty hard for him, as he needs to be moving and doing things and feeling productive. This placement makes him very restless.\u00a0 He probably has a bit of a healing touch, physically.\u00a0</p><p>Harry was probably the quietest in terms of the treatment from his previous management with One Direction, but he was also probably the most used member of the band. Someone with this placement can be easily taken advantage of by higher-ups, so much so that there is a need to break free and become your own boss. I\u2019ve heard that it was Harry\u2019s idea for the band to take a break, and it\u2019s understandable with this placement. 6th house placements produce a need to please and it probably caused him constant anxiety that he was being used as much as he likely was, thus prompting him to break free. Good for him, I say. The band may have given him everything, and it\u2019s obvious he\u2019s grateful, but it was also terrible for his health.\u00a0Sharing and partnerships can be a struggle for people with this placement, at least on a daily basis. They need space from anything resembling control over them from time to time, to recharge.\u00a0</p><p>Harry has probably realized at this point that he will always be in the service of other people. Someone who has this placement in Aries may have a hard time accepting this, and at times can feel caged by the realization, however the fact that this placement resides in an earth house can help and hinder that fact, both at the same time. The help comes from the fact that the earth environment of this placement can lessen the heat of Aries, so that the selfishness of the placement doesn\u2019t grow out of control. The hinder comes from the fact that such a selfish placement is forced to serve others, being that it\u2019s in the 6th house. It will be a constant struggle, but should be made easier by the fact that he is, at this time at least, seemingly in control of his own affairs and that he has a career that he genuinely seems to love.\u00a0</p><p>This is a placement of a lover that is very sensual, very passionate. Someone who all at once wants to take in sexual situations, while also wanting to give. This placement is in opposition to his rising, so I can see it causing a bit of awkwardness to his already slightly awkward personality. There would definitely be a lot of push and pull in his personality that can make people uncertain of where he\u2019s going to come from next. Especially since he\u2019s got so much Aquarius in his chart.\u00a0</p>",
