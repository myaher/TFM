Some people are upset and saying that it frees him of the blame, but it\u2019s not like it\u2019s exonerating him entirely, he did have <i>some</i> measure of control and they\u2019re not trying to say that he didn\u2019t, but it took what he was already feeling - anger towards Thor and jealousy towards Midgard - and twisted it into something that made him do what he would not have done in his right mind. It\u2019s not a retcon. Tom and Joss had discussions about what happened to Loki between movies before they filmed <i>The Avengers</i>, it was intended this whole time that he was being controlled. It\u2019s shown in the movie that people are negatively affected by being in a certain proximity to the scepter - see the Avengers getting into pointless heated arguments and Bruce picking it up without even knowing he was doing it. <i>Loki had that thing on him nearly the whole time</i>. Of course it did something to him. There\u2019s even evidence that it was messing with his memories, due to things such as recalling being tossed into the abyss, when in reality he was the one who intentionally let go as a suicide attempt. The Stone got inside his mind and rearranged the contents.</p><p>Mind Stone aside, there\u2019s every evidence that there was physical torture as well. In the end credits of <i>Thor</i>, he looks utterly rotten. He\u2019s dirty, he\u2019s bruised all over and has what appear to be burn marks, there\u2019s blood in his teeth. He\u2019s been through the wringer. When we see him at the beginning of <i>The Avengers</i>, he looks horrendously unwell, like he\u2019s been starved and dehydrated for who knows how long. He limps and has to hold onto things for balance, including an agent who had to help him up from outright falling down - something his pride would not allow to happen if he didn\u2019t seriously require it. Something has clearly happened to him, and between that and the threats he receives from The Other on behalf of Thanos, it\u2019s not difficult to figure out what.</p><p><i>\u201cIf you fail, if the Tesseract is kept from us, there will be no realm, no barren moon where he cannot find you. You think you know pain? He will make you long for something sweet as pain!\u201d</i> Those are The Other\u2019s exact words, and Loki is shaking and crying when he hears them. He shakes and cries in a sizable portion of the movie, actually. He has horrible threats against him to keep him in line during his more lucid moments. Even when he has more control of himself and his actions, he\u2019s being coerced under threat of unimaginable torture, worse than what\u2019s he\u2019s already suffered, and he has to keep up the act or he\u2019s toast. He\u2019s still responsible for his choices, but the reason behind them is understandable.</p><p><i>And it\u2019s been like that from the beginning</i>. This is the way it was written, and Tom made many deliberate acting choices based on that. He has confirmed that intent. One has to willfully ignore everything to make the claim that Loki wasn\u2019t influenced in any way, that he was just having the time of his life being evil. It\u2019s undeniable that Thanos had a very large part to play. This isn\u2019t something new and it\u2019s not a retcon of his character history, they\u2019re not just going with it because it was a popular theory and they want to cater to the fans. It\u2019s not even about giving him a defense so that he can look good. They\u2019re literally just acknowledging what has been true the whole time. Loki was canonically influenced by the Mind Stone and by Thanos.</p>",
