She chose to go to Braavos and learned many skills while there, but suffered great hardship, trauma and abuse.</p><p>Season 6</p><p>After Arya realized being an assassin wouldn&rsquo;t work out and she didn&rsquo;t have the constitution to kill people for money, she had the option of going &lsquo;West of Westeros&rsquo; to travel and explore, or going home. She ended up telling Jaqen&nbsp;&ldquo;\n\nA Girl is Arya Stark of Winterfell, and I&rsquo;m going home.&rdquo; That was a positive development for her, meant to show she was growing as a character and slowly healing from her trauma. She was redirecting the downhill trajectory of her life.</p><p>Season 7</p><p>Arya was working on finishing her list and avenging her family. She had just killed the Freys and had decided to go to King&rsquo;s Landing to kill Cersei until Hot Pie told her Jon was back in Winterfell. Arya had to option of continuing her path of bloodshed and solitude or reuniting with her family. She chose to go home to Winterfell, an incredibly powerful and emotional moment the audience cheered for, because she chose life and her family over death and loneliness.</p><p>Season 8</p><p>Now Arya has a choice between reverting back to her path of isolation and seclusion, or moving forward and choosing life, love and family. She has rejected Gendry so she could go and kill Cersei, but the season isn&rsquo;t over yet. Going off Arya&rsquo;s journey in the previous seasons it&rsquo;s very obvious to me that Arya choosing to be alone would be the tragedy, and her choosing to be with Gendry would be her happy ending. And given the outcome of her past dilemmas, isn&rsquo;t it obvious what decision she&rsquo;ll make?&nbsp;&ldquo;What do we say to the God of Death?&rdquo;&nbsp;&ldquo;Not Today.&rdquo; Arya Stark will always choose LIFE. That is her journey. Fuck you, Death. I&rsquo;m going to LIVE.</p>",
