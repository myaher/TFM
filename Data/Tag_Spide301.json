Somethings going on.\u201d</p><p>Ned finally understood why Peter didn\u2019t listen to him, it was because of you, his best friend. Peter was always worried about you when he wasn\u2019t around, even more when your relationship with your boyfriend turned into something intoxicating for you.</p><p>\u201cMaybe Y/N\u2019s Phone is just off.\u201d</p><p>Peter looked at him.\u00a0\u201cYou really think, that the phone of the most addicted texting person, is off?\u201d He asked in a sarcastic tone and tried to call you again.\u00a0\u201cHey Y/N, please call me back, I\u2019m really worried.\u201d</p><p>Ned shrugged with his shoulders. He knew that Peter was probably right and something happened between Tyler and you again. But still, he wanted to calm his best friend.</p><p>\u201cOkay, maybe you\u2019re right but Y/N would\u2019ve texted you if it was urgent. When her phone is off, then maybe she want\u2019s to be alone.\u201d Ned tried to sound convincing.</p><p>Peter looked out of the window and thought about what you\u2019d do right now. He was the only one you talked to when you felt bad.\u00a0</p><p>Peter and you were best friends since you were children, you two talked about anything and everything. After 6 months, when a Spider bit him and gave him his powers, he was honest with you about him being Spider-Man. You were so amazed about how much he trusts you, that you decided to be honest with him too and told him about your real condition of your depression.\u00a0</p><p>At first you learned how to handle it on your own, still with some medication, but with the help of your family and friends and some happy days, you could\u2019ve been\u00a0\u201chealed\u201d. But as your relationship with Tyler started to become toxic, your depression became worse and the only person you talked about it with honesty was Peter, because he was always the one who tried to understand you and never judged you in anyway.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  \u00a0 \u00a0 ~*~</p><p><b>One Day later:</b></p><p>Peter and his Team had won the competition and made their way back to school.\u00a0When he arrived at school, he expected you to wait for him already but no one was there.\u00a0</p><p>Peter decided to go to your house, to look for you. You didn\u2019t live far away from Peter, just four blocks. You had a nice <a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fi.pinimg.com%2F564x%2F2c%2F09%2F2c%2F2c092cb61ab3cc477395a5af668243ab.jpg&amp;t=MjEyNzc4ODIwMjZkMWRkMjAzNDcyYWM0NGZjNDhiMDc3YTBkOGRhMSwyMjI2YjFhMzlmMWUxMjIxN2YxN2I3NzkxYzNjZmNmYjBhNzkyNzNl\">house</a>, normal parents and besides the depression a good life.</p><p>Your parents loved Peter, they you\u2019d rather see him as your boyfriend than Tyler, especially your Mom. She saw how you became somehow addicted to him and did nearly anything he wants. Sometimes she couldn\u2019t recognize her own daughter, who was once so confident, wild and strong woman.</p><p>Peter ring the bell at the door and waited. He tried to stay calm, even when all he wanted to to was run into your house and look if you\u2019re okay.</p><p>\u201cHello Peter, how was Washington?\u201d Your Mother greeted him smiling.</p><p>Peter smiled soft.\u00a0\u201cIt was good, Mrs. Y/L/N. Is Y/N at home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately not, shall I tell her something when she gets back?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Peter tried to cover his\u00a0disappointment with a friendly smile.\u00a0\u201cJust tell her that I was here.\u201d</p><p>Your mother nodded.\u00a0\u201cIt was nice to see you. You can come on Saturday and eat dinner with us.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt was nice to see you too and of course, I\u2019ll be there!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Your mother smiled again, then she closed the door. Peter tried to think about all your favorite hiding spots and thought about on which of them he would look first. But he noticed that he still had his suitcase and should probably tell May that he\u2019s back.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0   \u00a0 \u00a0~*~  </p><p>Peter made his way home, still thinking about if you\u2019re alright and mostly where you could be.</p><p>\u201cHey Aunt May, I\u2019m home!\u201d</p><p>Nobody responded but Peter heard May singing in the shower. He chuckled a little. Not because her singing was bad but because he knew what was happening as soon as she comes out of the shower. May sang her favorite 80 or 90 songs always with passion, also really loud.. and every time she comes out of the shower, May would deny that she sang at all.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  \u00a0 \u00a0 ~*~  </p><p>Peter went into his room and put his earphones in. He was listening to the Playlist you two created on Spotify, with nearly any genre in it.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"220\" data-orig-width=\"540\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/f72d8b760bc2ecf2339d31c95d9eb232/tumblr_inline_pecizdeFpp1to74h4_540.gif\" data-orig-height=\"220\" data-orig-width=\"540\"/></figure><p>He couldn\u2019t believe his eyes as he saw no other but you, sitting on his bed with red eyes and red cheeks. You had climbed the fire escape up and sneaked into his room.</p><p>Peter pulled out his earphones. He saw that a tear, you were probably trying to hide, rolled down your face. You quickly wiped it away but noticed the look in Peter\u2019s eyes.</p><p>He didn\u2019t even had to hear what Tyler did again, he just wanted to go out and punch that guy in the face like he deserved it so many times.</p><p>Peter closed the door gently behind him. He put his suitcase down, then he walked over to you.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHey, sweetie.\u201d He greeted you and laid his arm around you.\u00a0</p><p>You let yourself fall into his lap and laid on his leg. He strokes your hair soft. Peter knew you\u2019d talk when you were ready to. To force you to tell him something would just push him away, even when he wanted to help you, he knew that being there was enough for you.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0~*~  </p><p>You started to cry but made no noise. Thats how Peter knew it was really bad, you didn\u2019t even sob. Just tears rolling down your face, on Peters Jeans.</p><p>\u201cWe fought again, same damn matter. I just can\u2019t trust him and I probably never will.\u201d You sighed.</p><p>Peter stroke your hair again.\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t know how much we talked about this and I don\u2019t know how much I\u2019ve to say this to you but Y/N, he cheated on you. Tyler did it physically and emotionally. He\u2019ll always flirt with others and even if you don\u2019t see it because he probably deletes it, he\u2019ll always text with others.\u201d</p><p>You knew Peter was right. It was the same your mom told you a hundred times.You knew that Tyler wasn\u2019t good for you in anyway, maybe he once was but that was a long time ago. Now all that the relationship was giving you, were toxic thoughts.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why I can\u2019t break up with him.. I try and I\u2019m always just one step away but then, when i\u2019m about to say it, I stop. I know you\u2019re right and even when you think, I wouldn\u2019t listen to you and do what I want anyways, I do listen and I know what I should do. I just don\u2019t know whats wrong with me that I stay after everything he did.\u201d You admitted</p><p>It hurt Peter to hearing you talk like this. He missed how happy you were before Tyler. How nobody could steal you confidence, how you had to tell him everything would be alright, when Flash locked him in a locker everyday.</p><p>\u201cTyler abused you with everything he did, it\u2019s no wonder that you can\u2019t trust him. I mean he has giving you no reason too. yes, he always say\u2019s he\u2019s sorry and promises to not do it again but in the end-\u201d</p><p>\u201c-It all starts again.\u201d You finished Peters words.</p><p>\u201cAnd the worst of all is, that he is the reason why you\u2019re getting sicker. I noticed that you became a bit thinner. He stresses you so much that you forget to eat or can\u2019t eat. Your depression grows because of him. The only reason why you won\u2019t leave him is because of your fears.\u201d</p><p>You got up and looked at him in confusion. You knew that he new about anxiety of being alone but you never told him about anything else.</p><p>\u201cY/N, I know you better than I know myself..\u201d Peter hesitated to say what he really thought but he knew you had to learn it the hard way. \u201cMaybe you feel like your identity is in him. Maybe you feel like you don\u2019t understand what life would be like without him. Maybe you feel like you just can\u2019t emotionally handle the change and everything is hitting you too fast, for you to even have a moment to breath. Maybe you feel that way. And if you do, you will live past it.\u201d</p><p>You were surprised about his words. You two had a lot of talks about your situation with Tyler, how much he had hurt you and you told him a lot of times how you felt, when your depression was hitting you again. But never would you have ever thought that he actually understood your feelings better than you did.</p><p>His words, everything he said was the pure truth. This was how you felt, this were your fears and you had no idea how to overcome them.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll live past it and I\u2019ll be with you every step of the way. I won\u2019t leave you and I\u2019ll also tell you this a hundred times more, hell, I\u2019ll tell it a thousand times everyday if it helps. And if you don\u2019t want to sleep alone, you know my window is always open. I\u2019m hear and we\u2019ll get through this.\u201d</p><p>You started crying again.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNo, no, no. Hush.\u201d Peter said and took you into his arms.\u00a0\u201cWhat did I say, what did I do wrong? I\u2019m sorry that I was so hard on you but-\u201d</p><p>You looked at him with a smile.\u00a0\u201cYou did nothing wrong, you did everything right, Parker.\u201d You wiped your tears away and hugged him.\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re the only person I believe when you say you won\u2019t leave me and I\u2019m happy to have you. Happy that you always listen, even when its the same shit all over again.\u201d</p><p>Peter smiled and kissed the top of your head.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ll always be there for you.\u201d</p><p>________________________</p><p><i>Sorry for the grammer mistakes, I\u2019ll take care of them in a few days but I really wanted to post this.

You were so amazed about how much he trusts you, that you decided to be honest with him too and told him about your real condition of your depression.\u00a0</p><p>At first you learned how to handle it on your own, still with some medication, but with the help of your family and friends and some happy days, you could\u2019ve been\u00a0\u201chealed\u201d.

She saw how you became somehow addicted to him and did nearly anything he wants. Sometimes she couldn\u2019t recognize her own daughter, who was once so confident, wild and strong woman.</p><p>Peter ring the bell at the door and waited. He tried to stay calm, even when all he wanted to to was run into your house and look if you\u2019re okay.</p><p>\u201cHello Peter, how was Washington?\u201d Your Mother greeted him smiling.</p><p>Peter smiled soft.\u00a0\u201cIt was good, Mrs. Y/L/N. Is Y/N at home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately not, shall I tell her something when she gets back?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Peter tried to cover his\u00a0disappointment with a friendly smile.\u00a0\u201cJust tell her that I was here.\u201d</p><p>Your mother nodded.\u00a0\u201cIt was nice to see you.

Peter tried to think about all your favorite hiding spots and thought about on which of them he would look first. But he noticed that he still had his suitcase and should probably tell May that he\u2019s back.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0   \u00a0 \u00a0~*~  </p><p>Peter made his way home, still thinking about if you\u2019re alright and mostly where you could be.</p><p>\u201cHey Aunt May, I\u2019m home!\u201d</p><p>Nobody responded but Peter heard May singing in the shower. He chuckled a little. Not because her singing was bad but because he knew what was happening as soon as she comes out of the shower. May sang her favorite 80 or 90 songs always with passion, also really loud.. and every time she comes out of the shower, May would deny that she sang at all.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  \u00a0 \u00a0 ~*~  </p><p>Peter went into his room and put his earphones in. He was listening to the Playlist you two created on Spotify, with nearly any genre in it.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"220\" data-orig-width=\"540\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/f72d8b760bc2ecf2339d31c95d9eb232/tumblr_inline_pecizdeFpp1to74h4_540.gif\" data-orig-height=\"220\" data-orig-width=\"540\"></figure><p>He couldn\u2019t believe his eyes as he saw no other but you, sitting on his bed with red eyes and red cheeks. You had climbed the fire escape up and sneaked into his room.</p><p>Peter pulled out his earphones. He saw that a tear, you were probably trying to hide, rolled down your face. You quickly wiped it away but noticed the look in Peter\u2019s eyes.</p><p>He didn\u2019t even had to hear what Tyler did again, he just wanted to go out and punch that guy in the face like he deserved it so many times.</p><p>Peter closed the door gently behind him. He put his suitcase down, then he walked over to you.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHey, sweetie.\u201d He greeted you and laid his arm around you.\u00a0</p><p>You let yourself fall into his lap and laid on his leg. He strokes your hair soft. Peter knew you\u2019d talk when you were ready to. To force you to tell him something would just push him away, even when he wanted to help you, he knew that being there was enough for you.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0~*~  </p><p>You started to cry but made no noise. Thats how Peter knew it was really bad, you didn\u2019t even sob. Just tears rolling down your face, on Peters Jeans.</p><p>\u201cWe fought again, same damn matter. I just can\u2019t trust him and I probably never will.\u201d You sighed.</p><p>Peter stroke your hair again.\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t know how much we talked about this and I don\u2019t know how much I\u2019ve to say this to you but Y/N, he cheated on you. Tyler did it physically and emotionally. He\u2019ll always flirt with others and even if you don\u2019t see it because he probably deletes it, he\u2019ll always text with others.\u201d</p><p>You knew Peter was right. It was the same your mom told you a hundred times.You knew that Tyler wasn\u2019t good for you in anyway, maybe he once was but that was a long time ago. Now all that the relationship was giving you, were toxic thoughts.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why I can\u2019t break up with him.. I try and I\u2019m always just one step away but then, when i\u2019m about to say it, I stop. I know you\u2019re right and even when you think, I wouldn\u2019t listen to you and do what I want anyways, I do listen and I know what I should do. I just don\u2019t know whats wrong with me that I stay after everything he did.\u201d You admitted</p><p>It hurt Peter to hearing you talk like this. He missed how happy you were before Tyler. How nobody could steal you confidence, how you had to tell him everything would be alright, when Flash locked him in a locker everyday.</p><p>\u201cTyler abused you with everything he did, it\u2019s no wonder that you can\u2019t trust him. I mean he has giving you no reason too. yes, he always say\u2019s he\u2019s sorry and promises to not do it again but in the end-\u201d</p><p>\u201c-It all starts again.\u201d You finished Peters words.</p><p>\u201cAnd the worst of all is, that he is the reason why you\u2019re getting sicker. I noticed that you became a bit thinner. He stresses you so much that you forget to eat or can\u2019t eat. Your depression grows because of him. The only reason why you won\u2019t leave him is because of your fears.\u201d</p><p>You got up and looked at him in confusion. You knew that he new about anxiety of being alone but you never told him about anything else.</p><p>\u201cY/N, I know you better than I know myself..\u201d Peter hesitated to say what he really thought but he knew you had to learn it the hard way. \u201cMaybe you feel like your identity is in him. Maybe you feel like you don\u2019t understand what life would be like without him. Maybe you feel like you just can\u2019t emotionally handle the change and everything is hitting you too fast, for you to even have a moment to breath. Maybe you feel that way. And if you do, you will live past it.\u201d</p><p>You were surprised about his words. You two had a lot of talks about your situation with Tyler, how much he had hurt you and you told him a lot of times how you felt, when your depression was hitting you again. But never would you have ever thought that he actually understood your feelings better than you did.</p><p>His words, everything he said was the pure truth. This was how you felt, this were your fears and you had no idea how to overcome them.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll live past it and I\u2019ll be with you every step of the way. I won\u2019t leave you and I\u2019ll also tell you this a hundred times more, hell, I\u2019ll tell it a thousand times everyday if it helps. And if you don\u2019t want to sleep alone, you know my window is always open. I\u2019m hear and we\u2019ll get through this.\u201d</p><p>You started crying again.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNo, no, no. Hush.\u201d Peter said and took you into his arms.\u00a0\u201cWhat did I say, what did I do wrong? I\u2019m sorry that I was so hard on you but-\u201d</p><p>You looked at him with a smile.\u00a0\u201cYou did nothing wrong, you did everything right, Parker.\u201d You wiped your tears away and hugged him.\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re the only person I believe when you say you won\u2019t leave me and I\u2019m happy to have you. Happy that you always listen, even when its the same shit all over again.\u201d</p><p>Peter smiled and kissed the top of your head.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ll always be there for you.\u201d</p><p>________________________</p><p><i>Sorry for the grammer mistakes, I\u2019ll take care of them in a few days but I really wanted to post this.

You quickly wiped it away but noticed the look in Peter\u2019s eyes.</p><p>He didn\u2019t even had to hear what Tyler did again, he just wanted to go out and punch that guy in the face like he deserved it so many times.</p><p>Peter closed the door gently behind him.

He strokes your hair soft. Peter knew you\u2019d talk when you were ready to.

Thats how Peter knew it was really bad, you didn\u2019t even sob. Just tears rolling down your face, on Peters Jeans.</p><p>\u201cWe fought again, same damn matter. I just can\u2019t trust him and I probably never will.\u201d You sighed.</p><p>Peter stroke your hair again.\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t know how much we talked about this and I don\u2019t know how much I\u2019ve to say this to you but Y/N, he cheated on you. Tyler did it physically and emotionally. He\u2019ll always flirt with others and even if you don\u2019t see it because he probably deletes it, he\u2019ll always text with others.\u201d</p><p>You knew Peter was right. It was the same your mom told you a hundred times.You knew that Tyler wasn\u2019t good for you in anyway, maybe he once was but that was a long time ago. Now all that the relationship was giving you, were toxic thoughts.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why I can\u2019t break up with him.. I try and I\u2019m always just one step away but then, when i\u2019m about to say it, I stop. I know you\u2019re right and even when you think, I wouldn\u2019t listen to you and do what I want anyways, I do listen and I know what I should do. I just don\u2019t know whats wrong with me that I stay after everything he did.\u201d You admitted</p><p>It hurt Peter to hearing you talk like this. He missed how happy you were before Tyler. How nobody could steal you confidence, how you had to tell him everything would be alright, when Flash locked him in a locker everyday.</p><p>\u201cTyler abused you with everything he did, it\u2019s no wonder that you can\u2019t trust him. I mean he has giving you no reason too. yes, he always say\u2019s he\u2019s sorry and promises to not do it again but in the end-\u201d</p><p>\u201c-It all starts again.\u201d You finished Peters words.</p><p>\u201cAnd the worst of all is, that he is the reason why you\u2019re getting sicker. I noticed that you became a bit thinner. He stresses you so much that you forget to eat or can\u2019t eat. Your depression grows because of him. The only reason why you won\u2019t leave him is because of your fears.\u201d</p><p>You got up and looked at him in confusion. You knew that he new about anxiety of being alone but you never told him about anything else.</p><p>\u201cY/N, I know you better than I know myself..\u201d Peter hesitated to say what he really thought but he knew you had to learn it the hard way. \u201cMaybe you feel like your identity is in him. Maybe you feel like you don\u2019t understand what life would be like without him. Maybe you feel like you just can\u2019t emotionally handle the change and everything is hitting you too fast, for you to even have a moment to breath. Maybe you feel that way. And if you do, you will live past it.\u201d</p><p>You were surprised about his words. You two had a lot of talks about your situation with Tyler, how much he had hurt you and you told him a lot of times how you felt, when your depression was hitting you again. But never would you have ever thought that he actually understood your feelings better than you did.</p><p>His words, everything he said was the pure truth. This was how you felt, this were your fears and you had no idea how to overcome them.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll live past it and I\u2019ll be with you every step of the way. I won\u2019t leave you and I\u2019ll also tell you this a hundred times more, hell, I\u2019ll tell it a thousand times everyday if it helps. And if you don\u2019t want to sleep alone, you know my window is always open. I\u2019m hear and we\u2019ll get through this.\u201d</p><p>You started crying again.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNo, no, no. Hush.\u201d Peter said and took you into his arms.\u00a0\u201cWhat did I say, what did I do wrong? I\u2019m sorry that I was so hard on you but-\u201d</p><p>You looked at him with a smile.\u00a0\u201cYou did nothing wrong, you did everything right, Parker.\u201d You wiped your tears away and hugged him.\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re the only person I believe when you say you won\u2019t leave me and I\u2019m happy to have you. Happy that you always listen, even when its the same shit all over again.\u201d</p><p>Peter smiled and kissed the top of your head.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ll always be there for you.\u201d</p><p>________________________</p><p><i>Sorry for the grammer mistakes, I\u2019ll take care of them in a few days but I really wanted to post this.

He thinks it might have something to do with your Depression and that something happened to you.</p><p><b>Word Count: 1,763</b></p><p><b>Authors Note: </b>This Story is kinda based on true stories out of my own life, really personal. I got inspired to write this because of a really good friend of mine, who helps me to get through everything. (Warnings: Depression/Toxic Relationship)&nbsp;</p><p><i>&gt;&gt;Serendipity -&nbsp;  the occurrence and development of events by chance in a happy or beneficial way.&lt;&lt;</i></p><p><i>________________________________</i></p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo; Ned asked curious, as he noticed Peter&rsquo;s nervous look, while he was texting on his phone.&nbsp;&ldquo;Its just another competition, you already did this a couple of times.&rdquo; He tried to calm his friend down.</p><p>Peter noticed that Ned was probably talking to him about the Academic Decathlon but he&nbsp;<a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thesaurus.com%2Fbrowse%2Fperceived&amp;t=OWI4ODI4YjQxY2Y1NGMxYzI4MWE5ZDgzNTgxM2E5MTk2OWRjNmQzYSxjOTE0ZDdlYmE2YWFlNDI5YWY3MzA3Zjc4ZTFiM2Q4MGEzNmE5ZjVj\">perceived</a>&nbsp;almost nothing. Peter was so focused on his phone, he was trying to reach you since yesterday when he left.</p><p>&ldquo;Damn it!&rdquo; Peter said frustrated, then he finally noticed Ned as he sat down next to him.&nbsp;&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t reach her. Somethings going on.&rdquo;</p><p>Ned finally understood why Peter didn&rsquo;t listen to him, it was because of you, his best friend. Peter was always worried about you when he wasn&rsquo;t around, even more when your relationship with your boyfriend turned into something intoxicating for you.</p><p>&ldquo;Maybe Y/N&rsquo;s Phone is just off.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter looked at him.&nbsp;&ldquo;You really think, that the phone of the most addicted texting person, is off?&rdquo; He asked in a sarcastic tone and tried to call you again.&nbsp;&ldquo;Hey Y/N, please call me back, I&rsquo;m really worried.&rdquo;</p><p>Ned shrugged with his shoulders. He knew that Peter was probably right and something happened between Tyler and you again. But still, he wanted to calm his best friend.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, maybe you&rsquo;re right but Y/N would&rsquo;ve texted you if it was urgent. When her phone is off, then maybe she want&rsquo;s to be alone.&rdquo; Ned tried to sound convincing.</p><p>Peter looked out of the window and thought about what you&rsquo;d do right now. He was the only one you talked to when you felt bad.&nbsp;</p><p>Peter and you were best friends since you were children, you two talked about anything and everything. After 6 months, when a Spider bit him and gave him his powers, he was honest with you about him being Spider-Man. You were so amazed about how much he trusts you, that you decided to be honest with him too and told him about your real condition of your depression.&nbsp;</p><p>At first you learned how to handle it on your own, still with some medication, but with the help of your family and friends and some happy days, you could&rsquo;ve been&nbsp;&ldquo;healed&rdquo;. But as your relationship with Tyler started to become toxic, your depression became worse and the only person you talked about it with honesty was Peter, because he was always the one who tried to understand you and never judged you in anyway.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; ~*~</p><p><b>One Day later:</b></p><p>Peter and his Team had won the competition and made their way back to school.&nbsp;When he arrived at school, he expected you to wait for him already but no one was there.&nbsp;</p><p>Peter decided to go to your house, to look for you. You didn&rsquo;t live far away from Peter, just four blocks. You had a nice <a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fi.pinimg.com%2F564x%2F2c%2F09%2F2c%2F2c092cb61ab3cc477395a5af668243ab.jpg&amp;t=MjEyNzc4ODIwMjZkMWRkMjAzNDcyYWM0NGZjNDhiMDc3YTBkOGRhMSwyMjI2YjFhMzlmMWUxMjIxN2YxN2I3NzkxYzNjZmNmYjBhNzkyNzNl\">house</a>, normal parents and besides the depression a good life.</p><p>Your parents loved Peter, they you&rsquo;d rather see him as your boyfriend than Tyler, especially your Mom. She saw how you became somehow addicted to him and did nearly anything he wants. Sometimes she couldn&rsquo;t recognize her own daughter, who was once so confident, wild and strong woman.</p><p>Peter ring the bell at the door and waited. He tried to stay calm, even when all he wanted to to was run into your house and look if you&rsquo;re okay.</p><p>&ldquo;Hello Peter, how was Washington?&rdquo; Your Mother greeted him smiling.</p><p>Peter smiled soft.&nbsp;&ldquo;It was good, Mrs. Y/L/N. Is Y/N at home?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Unfortunately not, shall I tell her something when she gets back?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Peter tried to cover his&nbsp;disappointment with a friendly smile.&nbsp;&ldquo;Just tell her that I was here.&rdquo;</p><p>Your mother nodded.&nbsp;&ldquo;It was nice to see you. You can come on Saturday and eat dinner with us.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;It was nice to see you too and of course, I&rsquo;ll be there!&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Your mother smiled again, then she closed the door. Peter tried to think about all your favorite hiding spots and thought about on which of them he would look first. But he noticed that he still had his suitcase and should probably tell May that he&rsquo;s back.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;   &nbsp; &nbsp;~*~  </p><p>Peter made his way home, still thinking about if you&rsquo;re alright and mostly where you could be.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey Aunt May, I&rsquo;m home!&rdquo;</p><p>Nobody responded but Peter heard May singing in the shower. He chuckled a little. Not because her singing was bad but because he knew what was happening as soon as she comes out of the shower. May sang her favorite 80 or 90 songs always with passion, also really loud.. and every time she comes out of the shower, May would deny that she sang at all.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; ~*~  </p><p>Peter went into his room and put his earphones in.
