So I know that I decided to stop writing until exams finish in June and I still have a ton of writing prompts to cover (I\u2019m so sorry I PROMISE I will get to them I love y\u2019all so much) but I was inspired by the ending of Game of Thrones and the possible Arya sequel that could come from it, so I was like\u00a0\u201cHey, why not try to write something?\u201d Not sure if it will go anywhere but wanted to write something, so if you watch Game of Thrones, here ya go!</p><p>*SPOILERS*- don\u2019t read if you haven\u2019t watched 08.06 and don\u2019t want to know anything!!!</p><p>**********</p><p>Arya Stark of Winterfell was staring out to sea, collecting her thoughts for her journey ahead. She processed her last few moments spent with her family. How she had told Jon- she didn\u2019t think she would ever be able to see him as a Targaryen; only as the brother who had cared for her as she had cared for him- that she wouldn\u2019t be able to meet him up at Castle Black. Her sister had also been confused, and asked her where she was going instead.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s west of Westeros?\u201d Arya had replied.\u00a0\u201cNo one knows. That\u2019s where all the maps stop. That\u2019s where I\u2019m going.\u201d Jon hugged her, and she couldn\u2019t help the stray tear that fell down her cheek.\u00a0</p><p>In a way, Arya missed her childhood. While she had never been happy learning to be a lady with polite conversation and sewing, her family had been truly happy. Whole. Her last memories with her mother, father, Robb, and Rickon&hellip; they all felt so distant now. The remaining Stark children had only reunited a short time ago, but now they were parting ways again. She feared that her remaining siblings would become distant memories to her in time too, but Arya had decided what she would do with her life, and she would follow through. She would not stitch tapestries all day; she would create her own future, away from all the pain she had experienced in this Gods-damned land.</p><p>After Jon had been escorted away to join the Night\u2019s Watch, she had turned to Sansa, who was still processing what Arya had said. Bran just sat there quietly.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going?\u201d Sansa whispered.</p><p>\u201cI have to, Sansa. I don\u2019t want to stay in Westeros for the rest of my life.

                "content": "<p>After that meta post that talked about Dany tending to the sick herself, I started thinking about what I personally consider to be the moral high points of ASOIAF, and I came up with four scenes that really encapsulate some of the books&rsquo; themes to me and, funnily enough, they&rsquo;re all scenes about female characters:</p><blockquote><p>Ser Barristan watched with ill-concealed apprehension. &ldquo;You should \nnot linger here overlong, Your Grace. The Astapori are being fed, as you\n commanded. There&rsquo;s no more we can do for the poor wretches. We should \nrepair back to the city.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Go if you wish, ser. I will not detain you. I will not detain any of you.&rdquo; Dany vaulted down from the horse. &ldquo;I cannot heal them, but I can show them that their Mother cares.&rdquo;</p><p>Jhogo\n sucked in his breath. &ldquo;Khaleesi, no.&rdquo; The bell in his braid rang softly\n as he dismounted. &ldquo;You must not get any closer. Do not let them touch \nyou! Do not!&rdquo;</p><p>Dany walked right past him. There \nwas an old man on the ground a few feet away, moaning and staring up at \nthe grey belly of the clouds. She knelt beside him, wrinkling her nose \nat the smell, and pushed back his dirty grey hair to feel his brow.<b> \n</b>&ldquo;His flesh is on fire. I need water to bathe him. Seawater will serve. \nMarselen, will you fetch some for me? I need oil as well, for the pyre. \nWho will help me burn the dead?&rdquo;</p><p>By the time Aggo returned with Grey Worm and fifty of the Unsullied \nloping behind his horse, Dany had shamed all of them into helping her&hellip;.</p></blockquote><p>&ndash;Daenerys IV, <i>A Dance with Dragons</i></p><blockquote><p><i>Wolves. </i>Arya went cold.<i> Robb&rsquo;s men, and my father&rsquo;s. </i>She felt drawn toward the cages. The bars allowed so little room that prisoners could neither sit nor turn; they stood naked, exposed to sun and wind and rain. The first three cages held dead men. Carrion crows had eaten out their eyes, yet the empty sockets seemed to follow her. The fourth man in the row stirred as she passed. Around his mouth his ragged beard was thick with blood and flies. They exploded when he spoke, buzzing around his head. &ldquo;Water.&rdquo; The word was a croak. &ldquo;Please &hellip; water &hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&hellip; She looked at their filthy hair and scraggly beards and reddened eyes, at their dry, cracked, bleeding lips. <i>Wolves</i>, she thought again. Like me. Was this her pack? <i>How could they be Robb&rsquo;s men?</i> She wanted to hit them. She wanted to hurt them. She wanted to cry. They all seemed to be looking at her, the living and the dead alike. The old man had squeezed three fingers out between the bars. &ldquo;Water,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;water.&rdquo;</p><p>Arya swung down from her horse. <i>They can&rsquo;t hurt me, they&rsquo;re dying</i>. She took her cup from her bedroll and went to the fountain. &ldquo;What do you think you&rsquo;re doing, boy?&rdquo; the townsman snapped. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re no concern o&rsquo; yours.&rdquo; She raised the cup to the fish&rsquo;s mouth. The water splashed across her fingers and down her sleeve, but Arya did not move until the cup was brimming over&hellip;.</p><p>The bars were too narrow to pass a cup through, but Harwin and Gendry offered her a leg up. She planted a food in Harwin&rsquo;s cupped hands, vaulted onto Gendry&rsquo;s shoulders, and grabbed the bars on top of the cage. The fat man turned his face up and pressed his cheek to the iron, and Arya poured the water over him.</p></blockquote><p>&ndash;Arya V, <i>A Storm of Swords</i></p><blockquote><p>Brienne sucked in her breath and drew Oathkeeper. <i>Too many</i>, she thought, with a start of fear, <i>they are too many</i>. &ldquo;Gendry,&rdquo; she said in a low voice, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll want a sword, and armor. These are not your friends. They&rsquo;re no one&rsquo;s friends.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What are you talking about?&rdquo; The boy came and stood beside her, his hammer in hand.</p><p>Lightning cracked to the south as the riders swung down off their horses. For half a heartbeat darkness turned to day. An axe gleamed silvery blue, light shimmered off mail and plate, and beneath the dark hood of the lead rider Brienne glimpsed an iron snout and rows of steel teeth, snarling.</p><p>Gendry saw it too. &ldquo;Him.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not him. His helm.&rdquo; Brienne tried to keep the fear from her voice, but her mouth was dry as dust. She had a pretty good notion who wore the Hound&rsquo;s helm. <i>The children</i>, she thought.</p><p>The door the the inn banged open. Willow stepped out into the rain, a crossbow in her hands. The girl was shouting at the riders, but a clap of thunder rolled across the yard, drowning out her words. As it faded, Brienne heard the man in the Hound&rsquo;s helm say, &ldquo;Loose a quarrel at me and I&rsquo;ll shove that crossbow up your cunt and fuck you with it. Then I&rsquo;ll pop your fucking eyes out and make you eat them.&rdquo; The fury in the man&rsquo;s voice drove Willow back a step, trembling.</p><p><i>Seven</i>, Brienne thought again, despairing. She had no chance against seven, she knew. <i>No chance, and no choice</i>.</p><p>She stepped out into the rain, Oathkeeper in hand. &ldquo;<i>Leave her be</i>. If you want to rape someone, try me.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>&ndash;Brienne VII, <i>A Feast for Crows</i></p><blockquote><p>The freerider, a small man in dented plate without device, duly appeared at the west end of the yard, but of his opponent there was no sign. Finally a chestnut stallion trotted into view in a swirl of crimson and scarlet silks, but Ser Dontos was not on it. The knight appeared a moment later, cursing and staggering, clad in breastplate and plumed helm and nothing else. His legs were pale and skinny, and his manhood flopped about obscenely as he chased after his horse. The watchers roared and shouted insults. Catching his horse by the bridle, Ser Dontos tried to mount, but the animal would not stand still and the knight was so drunk that his bare foot kept missing the stirrup.</p><p>By then the crowd was howling with laughter &hellip; all but the king. Joffrey had a look in his eyes that Sansa remembered well, the same look he&rsquo;d had at the Great Sept of Baelor the day he pronounced death on Lord Eddard Stark. Finally Ser Dontos the Red gave it up for a bad job, sat down in the dirt, and removed his plumed helm. &ldquo;I lose,&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;Fetch me some wine.&rdquo;</p><p>The king stood. &ldquo;A cask from the cellars! I&rsquo;ll see him drowned in it.&rdquo;</p><p>Sansa heard herself gasp. &ldquo;<i>No</i>, you can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p><p>Joffrey turned his head. &ldquo;What did you say?&rdquo;</p><p>Sansa could not believe she had spoken. Was she mad? To tell him <i>no</i> in front of half the court? She hadn&rsquo;t meant to say anything, only &hellip; Ser Dontos was drunk and silly and useless, but he meant no harm.</p><p>&ldquo;Did you say <i>can&rsquo;t</i>?

She had a life before Jaime Lannister, a purpose beyond being someone\u2019s wife and mistress of some land. Evenfall Hall was not what she wanted - the King\u2019s Guard was, and she made it.

It&rsquo;s only the second time piano has been used in the\u00a0<em>Game of Thrones\u00a0</em>score, that I can think of\u2026</b></p><p>To go back to the other piano piece, &ldquo;The Light of the Seven,&rdquo; that one had quite an impact because \u2014 and I&rsquo;ve talked about this before \u2014 but the fact that we&rsquo;re using piano there for the first time was quite a shocker in itself. It wasn&rsquo;t part of the language of the score. When that piano came in, the listener immediately goes, &ldquo;Whoa, what is this music? What&rsquo;s happening?&rdquo; It slowly unfolds into the big explosion of Cersei&rsquo;s plan. Jump to &ldquo;The Night King.&rdquo; At this point in time in the episodes, we have had 70 minutes of tension and action music in this big battle. Here&rsquo;s a scene where there&rsquo;s an opportunity to use the piano again, and yet again influence the listener in certain ways. This time, we&rsquo;re telling them, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s piano coming in. The battle is over. We&rsquo;ve had multiple attempts to stop the Night King and nothing has worked against his army.&rdquo; The piano starts, and the intention is to give you some closure. It almost has the reverse effect as &ldquo;The Light of the Seven.&rdquo; We knew how that song would slowly build and at the end, there&rsquo;s the explosion. In this particular case, you&rsquo;re seeing closure all the way. Everyone is at the end of their abilities and they have either given up or will give up and it will soon be over. The Night King, just like Cersei, will follow through. This is going to be it. But then it has the reverse effect when Arya comes out of nowhere to save the day. It was interesting to be able to do this just because of the one other time we had piano.

In this particular case, you\u2019re seeing closure all the way. Everyone is at the end of their abilities and they have either given up or will give up and it will soon be over. The Night King, just like Cersei, will follow through. This is going to be it. But then it has the reverse effect when Arya comes out of nowhere to save the day.

        "body": "<h1>An Unexpected Journey: Part 4</h1><p>A wolf\u2019s den it was because sitting around the table with Sansa and Bran was her older brother Jon. Her breath had caught and her eyes went wide. This was more of a surprise than finding out Sansa was pregnant.</p><p>She immediately ran to him and jumped into his arms like she had nearly six years prior. His chuckle tickled her ear and she relaxed instantly in his grasp. She scarcely believed that he was here holding her.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d She asked as he let her down to the floor.</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re not the only one capable of surprises.\u201d He ruffled her hair as he spoke.</p><p>She pushed his hand away and playfully shoved him. Her eyes flicked to Sansa and she instantly knew.</p><p>\u201cYou told him?\u201d</p><p>Sansa smiled and gave a quick nod. \u201cThe moment we got your letters we decided to plan this whole surprise. We knew you\u2019d try to make your way to Dragonstone after you came to King\u2019s Landing, so we decided to bring Dragonstone here, or rather its very important people, here.\u201d</p><p>Arya was in disbelief. Her family all in once place together again. It was nearly impossible to believe, yet here it was unfolding in front of her very eyes.</p><p>\u201cAnd Daenerys?\u201d Arya asked as they all started to take their seats around the table. Bran was at one side of the head while Sansa was at the other. Their significant others to the right of them while Tyrion, Jon, and herself took whatever seats remained.</p><p>\u201cShe putting the twins down to rest. They were quite rowdy on the boat ride here.\u201d Jon has said.</p><p>Arya nearly chocked on her wine, \u201cTwins? But the last letter I received from you said it only to be one babe, not two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, and if you had sent more letters like you should\u2019ve I would have been able to tell you that we had a twins.\u201d Jon said matter of fact.</p><p>Arya waved her hand dismissively , \u201cYes, yes. Sansa already told me I should\u2019ve written more often.\u201d</p><p>Smiles and laughter filled the small council room as the family ate. They were sharing their stories and adventures to Arya and she couldn\u2019t help but feel elated. She had truly missed this. For so long she had been alone and had been focused on her kill list that there was little room left for love and happiness. Now that it was all over and she could see the bright faces before her she started to believe that she could finally have all that she never thought she could.</p><p>\u201cSo Lord Tyrion, I\u2019ve heard my siblings life stories and what I missed these past years, but I haven\u2019t heard how your life is going. Please do enlighten me?\u201d Arya asked.</p><p>Tyrion took a sip of his wine; he was on his fourth cup. He cleared his throat and spoke.</p><p>\u201cWell, if you must know, I have married.\u201d</p><p>Arya\u2019s brows lifted in surprise. \u201cReally? Hmm won\u2019t this be your third?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd my last, I hope.\u201d He lifted his goblet to the Gods.</p><p>\u201cWell, who is she?\u201d Curiosity taking over Arya.</p><p>\u201cWell she ah-\u201c He was interrupted by a new voice that had joined the council room.</p><p>\u201cShe was one of my Dothraki hand maids.\u201d It was Daenerys that spoke. Arya hadn\u2019t noticed her enter the room.</p><p>Arya stood from her seat and greeted the former Dragon Queen with a small bow.</p><p>\u201cDaenerys. It\u2019s nice to see you&hellip;on good terms.\u201d</p><p>Dany gave a small smile and quickly embraced the young assassin. Arya was surprised by the sudden gesture and wasn\u2019t sure how to respond. She hadn\u2019t been close to Dany, not even after Jon had talked her down from burning thousands of innocent people alive.</p><p>When Arya had left to travel, Dany\u2019s mental state was not in the best condition. She was still recovering from her losses and was paranoid that people where still trying to poison her.</p><p>From one of the few letters she had gotten from Jon, it took her time to recover. It wasn\u2019t until she found out that she a babe in her belly that she realized what was most important and ultimately giving up the throne to Bran.</p><p>Arya returned the embrace. She still wasn\u2019t sure how she felt about Daenerys Targaryen, but she did believe that, with time, they could become friends.</p><p>\u201cIt is good to see you too, Arya.\u201d Dany said as she let Arya go.</p><p>Arya returned to her seat and Dany sat beside Jon.</p><p>\u201cI am sorry I was late. I had to put the twins down for a nap. They were a little agitated on the boat ride here.\u201d Dany said as she took a bite of her food.</p><p>\u201cOh nonsense! I\u2019ll be in your shoes come four moons time.\u201d Sansa assured her.</p><p>Arya looked between the two ladies and was surprised by their interaction. The last time there were in the same room they wanted to kill each other. Now, they looked liked the best of friends, smiling and laughing with one another. It was almost sickening to Arya, but she had to remember that she had been gone for five years and that was plenty of time for them to strike a friendship.</p><p>\u201cSo tell me Arya, how were your travels? Find anything interesting?\u201d Dany asked her.</p><p>Arya washed her food down with the remainder of her wine before she spoke. \u201cNothing much, just a lot of sea and few small islands that had friendly natives. We did find a rather large mass of land that we mapped, but there weren\u2019t any people that we saw. Then after that we just sailed around Essos and stopped when we needed supplies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt sounds like you enjoyed yourself.\u201d Dany quipped.</p><p>Arya nodded, \u201cOh yeah! It was liberating. I had command of the ship and the men listened to me. But eventually I did miss home. That\u2019s why I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how long do you plan on staying?\u201d She asked her.</p><p>Arya was hoping no one would ask that damned question. She really didn\u2019t want to explain why she wasn\u2019t staying in King\u2019s Landing. The only one who knew her plans was deep into his fifth cup of wine. She glanced at him and he gave a small hiccup. He wiped his mouth of whatever wine may have spilled out of it and looked up at Arya, a grin covering his face.</p><p>\u201cOh yes! Please do tell us how long you are staying, Lady Stark! Was it two days or three? I can\u2019t quite remember what that navigator of yours said.\u201d His words were slightly slurred.</p><p>Arya shot daggers at the imp and swore that one day she would slit his throat in his sleep. </p><p>She could feel the many pairs of eyes lingering on her body, each with their own impending question. This is exactly why she wanted to keep it hush. She hated answering questions that she really didn&rsquo;t have an answer to and she had a feeling that she was about to receive plenty of them. </p><p>Sansa was the first, as always, to ask the question that undoubtedly on everyone&rsquo;s mind. </p><p>&ldquo;You are not staying? Where are you going?&rdquo; Her tone was harsh but the hurt in her voice was undeniably recognizable. </p><p>&ldquo;I-&rdquo; She was cut off by Jon before she could answer he sister&rsquo;s question. </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re sailing again, aren&rsquo;t you? Haven&rsquo;t you had enough of the sea?&rdquo; </p><p>Arya&rsquo;s eyes widened. &ldquo;No! No! I am not sailing again. I&rsquo;ve truly had enough of the high seas.&rdquo; She assured her family. </p><p>&ldquo;Then where are you going?&rdquo; Sansa asked once more. </p><p>Arya hesitated. She didn&rsquo;t want to tell them where she was going. She shouldn&rsquo;t have to, but if she didn&rsquo;t she knew her family would be hurt and didn&rsquo;t think that she could bear to see their weary faces. </p><p>With a sigh, Arya answered. &ldquo;I am staying in Westeros and I&rsquo;ll be back to King&rsquo;s Landing, I promise. I just have one more place to go to before I even begin to think about settling down.&rdquo; </p><p>She saw the tension in her family ease a bit. They truly believed that she would up a leave again and that broke her heart. She didn&rsquo;t want them to expect for her to leave. They knew she was a wanderer, but she had hoped they would believe her to stay. But she had been gone from for five years and perhaps they only knew her as she had been and as what she was now. \u00a0</p><p>&ldquo;And where is this place that you have to visit? Hmm? You haven&rsquo;t been any where else but Winterfell and King&rsquo;s Landing, so where else would you have to go?&rdquo; Her sister was becoming impatient due to the lack of answers that Arya was providing. </p><p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s not necessarily true. I have been to the Riverlands and Harrenhal, but that&rsquo;s another story.&rdquo; She said matter of fact. </p><p>Sansa face was starting to beam red. Arya&rsquo;s blatant disregard for answering her questions was becoming irritating. </p><p>&ldquo;Arya! You know what I mean. Now please tell me where you are going.&rdquo; </p><p>Now Arya was the one becoming annoyed. She didn&rsquo;t want to answer her sister&rsquo;s questions, nor did she have to. She was a woman grown of twenty and three and didn&rsquo;t need to explain her reasonings. If her sister wanted to know the truth, she could go to their brother Bran, who seemed to have all the answers. </p><p>Arya crossed her arms over her chest and remained silent. She wasn&rsquo;t going to give her sister the satisfaction. Although, she couldn&rsquo;t say as much for the imp sitting beside her. </p><p>&ldquo;I think I can answer that as well.&rdquo; He hiccuped. </p><p>Arya turned to the imp, &ldquo;If you say a single word, I will make sure that you never see tomorrow.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;You are not a sprightly young lass are you?&rdquo; Tyrion inquired. </p><p>Arya instinctively reached for Cat&rsquo;s Paw, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll me more than happy to show you sprightly.&rdquo; </p><p>Tyrion looked down at Arya&rsquo;s hand resting on the hilt of her dagger. He decided that today was not the day to be clever. &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ve had too much wine. I will be retiring to my chambers and fucking my wife. See most of you all on the morrow.&rdquo; He lifted from his seat and turned to Bran and bowed, &ldquo;Your Grace.&rdquo; </p><p>Bran nodded and Tyrion waddled out of the council room with his goblet of wine in hand. </p><p>&ldquo;Arya, you cannot threaten him like that. He is the Lord Hand of the seven kingdoms.:&rdquo; Sansa chastised. </p><p>Arya grumbled, &ldquo;I can threaten who I please.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Why are you so stubborn? Why can&rsquo;t you just tell me where you are going?&rdquo; Sansa tried again. </p><p>Arya&rsquo;s blood was boiling and she wasn&rsquo;t going to be able to keep her head any longer. </p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have to tell you where I am going! I am not telling you where I am going! It is my business! But,&rdquo; Arya calmed herself, &ldquo;I can promise you that I will be back in time for the birth of your babe.&rdquo; </p><p>Sansa&rsquo;s face was stoic. She gave a curt nod and said, &ldquo;That is it then.&rdquo; and raised from her seat. &ldquo;Come, Pod. I no longer wish to squabble with my sister. I will see her when she returns from where ever she is going.&rdquo; </p><p>Pod gave Arya an apologetic look and helped Sansa out of the council room. </p><p>The remainder of the guest stayed silent. Meera was still munching in a half eaten piece of bread and Dany was whispering to Jon. The awkward tension that filled the air was becoming unbearable. </p><p>Bran was the one to break the silence. </p><p>&ldquo;Meera, why don&rsquo;t we retire for the night? I&rsquo;m sure Arya will enjoy her travels. Please do keep an open mind when you go see him, he has been through quite a bit in these last years.&rdquo; </p><p>Meera lifted from her seat and rolled Bran to the door. &ldquo;It was nice meeting you, Arya.&rdquo; She told her as they exited. </p><p>Arya&rsquo;s eyes quickly locked with Jon&rsquo;s. He was going to ask her question when Dany intervened. &ldquo;Leave her be. She isn&rsquo;t answering any questions.&rdquo; Arya silently thanked her. She pushed her chair back and exited the council room, heading to her chambers. </p><p>She hated that, even now after all these years, Sansa was still in some small way trying to control her. But Arya wasn&rsquo;t that little girl that anymore, she hadn&rsquo;t been for a long time. </p><p>Arya was making her way to her chambers for the night to prepare for her journey to Storm&rsquo;s End when she heard giggling coming from a near by chamber room. She veered left instead of the right that she needed to take to head to her chambers. </p><p>The giggling sounded young and childish and there were distinctively two sets of giggles coming from the closed door that was facing her. Arya gently pushed the door open and saw two young girls no older than five namedays sitting in the middle of the room playing with their tiny wooden direwolves. One girl had dark black hair with dark eyes to match while the other had silver hair that shined like the moon; her eyes were a loveliest shade of violet that Arya had ever seen. </p><p>She knew right then and there those were her nieces that were born just a few moons after she had left on her journey. They were beautiful and no one could deny that they belonged to Dany and Jon. </p><p>&ldquo;There are beautiful, are they not?&rdquo; A voice came from behind Arya. </p><p>She jumped and spun to see Daenerys staring at her. It was not easy to sneak up on Arya Stark, but Dany had done so, probably due to the fact Arya was so enticed with the twins that were in front of her. </p><p>&ldquo;They are. What are their names?&rdquo; Asked Arya. </p><p>Dany smiled, &ldquo;The one with hair like mine is named after my mother, Rhaella and the spitting image of Jon, Lyarya.&rdquo; </p><p>Arya chuckled at the name, &ldquo;Why in seven hells would you name her Lyarya? I&rsquo;ve never even heard of it.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Well, we wanted to name both of them after our mothers, but Jon feared that people would think that we named her after Lyanna Mormont, not Lyanna Stark. He also wanted to name her after his favorite sister, so we combined the names.&rdquo; </p><p>Arya&rsquo;s eyes grew in realization. Their child was named after her. But why? What had she done to have a child named after her? Why was she so special? </p><p>&ldquo;We named her after you, not because you defeated the Night King or because you survived the Battle of King&rsquo;s Landing. We named her after you because you were unafraid to tell me that I was wrong. I remember that day like it happened a fortnight ago. It was several days after the Battle of King&rsquo;s Landing and I was still in a difficult place. Yes, your brother was able to convince me to not burn the city down, but it was you who came up to me and told me that if I ever had a moment in life where I willing chose to end thousands of innocent lives, that you would shut my eyes forever.&rdquo; Dany hesitated and Arya could see the emotion in her eyes. </p><p>&ldquo;No one, not even my advisers had ever been so bold to say that to me. You, along with many other people, helped pull me out of my despair. So that is why we named her after you. Because you are beautiful and strong and never afraid to speak your mind.&rdquo; </p><p>Arya was truly touched by the words Dany had told her. She never thought that she was beautiful in any sort of way. But here this woman was, who was the definition of beauty, telling Arya Horseface that she was beautiful. It made her mind immediately jump to Gendry and the night after the Battle of Winterfell. He had told her she was beautiful and she didn&rsquo;t believe it. She didn&rsquo;t want to believe it. Now, she wishes that she had. </p><p>&ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo; She told Dany. </p><p>Dany gave her a smile and squeezed her shoulder gently. &ldquo;I know where you are going. Do not worry yourself, your secret is safe with me. But head Bran&rsquo;s warning; keep an open mind.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;What does that even mean? And how did you know?&rdquo; She asked her. </p><p>&ldquo;I may have not been myself five years ago, but I was still an observant woman. I know love when I see it. As for the warning, you&rsquo;ll come to find out Arya Stark of Winterfell.&rdquo; And with that Dany brushed passed her and entered the twins room, closing the door behind her. </p><p>Arya was more confused than ever and was wondering if going to Storm&rsquo;s End was such a good idea. You have nothing to worry about she assured herself. She was going to Storm&rsquo;s End on the morrow and no one was going to stop her. </p>",

I\u2019ll be in your shoes come four moons time.\u201d Sansa assured her.</p><p>Arya looked between the two ladies and was surprised by their interaction.

Find anything interesting?\u201d Dany asked her.</p><p>Arya washed her food down with the remainder of her wine before she spoke. \u201cNothing much, just a lot of sea and few small islands that had friendly natives. We did find a rather large mass of land that we mapped, but there weren\u2019t any people that we saw. Then after that we just sailed around Essos and stopped when we needed supplies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt sounds like you enjoyed yourself.\u201d Dany quipped.</p><p>Arya nodded, \u201cOh yeah! It was liberating. I had command of the ship and the men listened to me. But eventually I did miss home. That\u2019s why I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how long do you plan on staying?\u201d She asked her.</p><p>Arya was hoping no one would ask that damned question. She really didn\u2019t want to explain why she wasn\u2019t staying in King\u2019s Landing. The only one who knew her plans was deep into his fifth cup of wine. She glanced at him and he gave a small hiccup. He wiped his mouth of whatever wine may have spilled out of it and looked up at Arya, a grin covering his face.</p><p>\u201cOh yes! Please do tell us how long you are staying, Lady Stark! Was it two days or three? I can\u2019t quite remember what that navigator of yours said.\u201d His words were slightly slurred.</p><p>Arya shot daggers at the imp and swore that one day she would slit his throat in his sleep. </p><p>She could feel the many pairs of eyes lingering on her body, each with their own impending question. This is exactly why she wanted to keep it hush. She hated answering questions that she really didn\u2019t have an answer to and she had a feeling that she was about to receive plenty of them. </p><p>Sansa was the first, as always, to ask the question that undoubtedly on everyone\u2019s mind. </p><p>\u201cYou are not staying? Where are you going?\u201d Her tone was harsh but the hurt in her voice was undeniably recognizable. </p><p>\u201cI-\u201d She was cut off by Jon before she could answer he sister\u2019s question. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sailing again, aren\u2019t you? Haven\u2019t you had enough of the sea?\u201d </p><p>Arya\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cNo! No! I am not sailing again. I\u2019ve truly had enough of the high seas.\u201d She assured her family. </p><p>\u201cThen where are you going?\u201d Sansa asked once more. </p><p>Arya hesitated. She didn\u2019t want to tell them where she was going. She shouldn\u2019t have to, but if she didn\u2019t she knew her family would be hurt and didn\u2019t think that she could bear to see their weary faces. </p><p>With a sigh, Arya answered. \u201cI am staying in Westeros and I\u2019ll be back to King\u2019s Landing, I promise. I just have one more place to go to before I even begin to think about settling down.\u201d </p><p>She saw the tension in her family ease a bit. They truly believed that she would up a leave again and that broke her heart. She didn\u2019t want them to expect for her to leave. They knew she was a wanderer, but she had hoped they would believe her to stay. But she had been gone from for five years and perhaps they only knew her as she had been and as what she was now. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cAnd where is this place that you have to visit? Hmm? You haven\u2019t been any where else but Winterfell and King\u2019s Landing, so where else would you have to go?\u201d Her sister was becoming impatient due to the lack of answers that Arya was providing. </p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s not necessarily true. I have been to the Riverlands and Harrenhal, but that\u2019s another story.\u201d She said matter of fact. </p><p>Sansa face was starting to beam red. Arya\u2019s blatant disregard for answering her questions was becoming irritating. </p><p>\u201cArya! You know what I mean. Now please tell me where you are going.\u201d </p><p>Now Arya was the one becoming annoyed. She didn\u2019t want to answer her sister\u2019s questions, nor did she have to. She was a woman grown of twenty and three and didn\u2019t need to explain her reasonings. If her sister wanted to know the truth, she could go to their brother Bran, who seemed to have all the answers. </p><p>Arya crossed her arms over her chest and remained silent. She wasn\u2019t going to give her sister the satisfaction. Although, she couldn\u2019t say as much for the imp sitting beside her. </p><p>\u201cI think I can answer that as well.\u201d He hiccuped. </p><p>Arya turned to the imp, \u201cIf you say a single word, I will make sure that you never see tomorrow.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou are not a sprightly young lass are you?\u201d Tyrion inquired. </p><p>Arya instinctively reached for Cat\u2019s Paw, \u201cI\u2019ll me more than happy to show you sprightly.\u201d </p><p>Tyrion looked down at Arya\u2019s hand resting on the hilt of her dagger. He decided that today was not the day to be clever. \u201cI think I\u2019ve had too much wine. I will be retiring to my chambers and fucking my wife. See most of you all on the morrow.\u201d He lifted from his seat and turned to Bran and bowed, \u201cYour Grace.\u201d </p><p>Bran nodded and Tyrion waddled out of the council room with his goblet of wine in hand. </p><p>\u201cArya, you cannot threaten him like that. He is the Lord Hand of the seven kingdoms.:\u201d Sansa chastised. </p><p>Arya grumbled, \u201cI can threaten who I please.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhy are you so stubborn? Why can\u2019t you just tell me where you are going?\u201d Sansa tried again. </p><p>Arya\u2019s blood was boiling and she wasn\u2019t going to be able to keep her head any longer. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have to tell you where I am going! I am not telling you where I am going! It is my business! But,\u201d Arya calmed herself, \u201cI can promise you that I will be back in time for the birth of your babe.\u201d </p><p>Sansa\u2019s face was stoic. She gave a curt nod and said, \u201cThat is it then.\u201d and raised from her seat. \u201cCome, Pod. I no longer wish to squabble with my sister. I will see her when she returns from where ever she is going.\u201d </p><p>Pod gave Arya an apologetic look and helped Sansa out of the council room. </p><p>The remainder of the guest stayed silent. Meera was still munching in a half eaten piece of bread and Dany was whispering to Jon. The awkward tension that filled the air was becoming unbearable. </p><p>Bran was the one to break the silence. </p><p>\u201cMeera, why don\u2019t we retire for the night? I\u2019m sure Arya will enjoy her travels. Please do keep an open mind when you go see him, he has been through quite a bit in these last years.\u201d </p><p>Meera lifted from her seat and rolled Bran to the door. \u201cIt was nice meeting you, Arya.\u201d She told her as they exited. </p><p>Arya\u2019s eyes quickly locked with Jon\u2019s. He was going to ask her question when Dany intervened. \u201cLeave her be. She isn\u2019t answering any questions.\u201d Arya silently thanked her. She pushed her chair back and exited the council room, heading to her chambers. </p><p>She hated that, even now after all these years, Sansa was still in some small way trying to control her. But Arya wasn\u2019t that little girl that anymore, she hadn\u2019t been for a long time. </p><p>Arya was making her way to her chambers for the night to prepare for her journey to Storm\u2019s End when she heard giggling coming from a near by chamber room. She veered left instead of the right that she needed to take to head to her chambers. </p><p>The giggling sounded young and childish and there were distinctively two sets of giggles coming from the closed door that was facing her. Arya gently pushed the door open and saw two young girls no older than five namedays sitting in the middle of the room playing with their tiny wooden direwolves. One girl had dark black hair with dark eyes to match while the other had silver hair that shined like the moon; her eyes were a loveliest shade of violet that Arya had ever seen. </p><p>She knew right then and there those were her nieces that were born just a few moons after she had left on her journey. They were beautiful and no one could deny that they belonged to Dany and Jon. </p><p>\u201cThere are beautiful, are they not?\u201d A voice came from behind Arya. </p><p>She jumped and spun to see Daenerys staring at her. It was not easy to sneak up on Arya Stark, but Dany had done so, probably due to the fact Arya was so enticed with the twins that were in front of her. </p><p>\u201cThey are. What are their names?\u201d Asked Arya. </p><p>Dany smiled, \u201cThe one with hair like mine is named after my mother, Rhaella and the spitting image of Jon, Lyarya.\u201d </p><p>Arya chuckled at the name, \u201cWhy in seven hells would you name her Lyarya? I\u2019ve never even heard of it.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell, we wanted to name both of them after our mothers, but Jon feared that people would think that we named her after Lyanna Mormont, not Lyanna Stark. He also wanted to name her after his favorite sister, so we combined the names.\u201d </p><p>Arya\u2019s eyes grew in realization. Their child was named after her. But why? What had she done to have a child named after her? Why was she so special? </p><p>\u201cWe named her after you, not because you defeated the Night King or because you survived the Battle of King\u2019s Landing. We named her after you because you were unafraid to tell me that I was wrong. I remember that day like it happened a fortnight ago. It was several days after the Battle of King\u2019s Landing and I was still in a difficult place. Yes, your brother was able to convince me to not burn the city down, but it was you who came up to me and told me that if I ever had a moment in life where I willing chose to end thousands of innocent lives, that you would shut my eyes forever.\u201d Dany hesitated and Arya could see the emotion in her eyes. </p><p>\u201cNo one, not even my advisers had ever been so bold to say that to me. You, along with many other people, helped pull me out of my despair. So that is why we named her after you. Because you are beautiful and strong and never afraid to speak your mind.\u201d </p><p>Arya was truly touched by the words Dany had told her. She never thought that she was beautiful in any sort of way. But here this woman was, who was the definition of beauty, telling Arya Horseface that she was beautiful. It made her mind immediately jump to Gendry and the night after the Battle of Winterfell. He had told her she was beautiful and she didn\u2019t believe it. She didn\u2019t want to believe it. Now, she wishes that she had. </p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d She told Dany. </p><p>Dany gave her a smile and squeezed her shoulder gently. \u201cI know where you are going. Do not worry yourself, your secret is safe with me. But head Bran\u2019s warning; keep an open mind.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhat does that even mean? And how did you know?\u201d She asked her. </p><p>\u201cI may have not been myself five years ago, but I was still an observant woman. I know love when I see it. As for the warning, you\u2019ll come to find out Arya Stark of Winterfell.\u201d And with that Dany brushed passed her and entered the twins room, closing the door behind her. </p><p>Arya was more confused than ever and was wondering if going to Storm\u2019s End was such a good idea. You have nothing to worry about she assured herself. She was going to Storm\u2019s End on the morrow and no one was going to stop her. </p></p>",

Her breath had caught and her eyes went wide. This was more of a surprise than finding out Sansa was pregnant.</p><p>She immediately ran to him and jumped into his arms like she had nearly six years prior. His chuckle tickled her ear and she relaxed instantly in his grasp. She scarcely believed that he was here holding her.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d She asked as he let her down to the floor.</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re not the only one capable of surprises.\u201d He ruffled her hair as he spoke.</p><p>She pushed his hand away and playfully shoved him. Her eyes flicked to Sansa and she instantly knew.</p><p>\u201cYou told him?\u201d</p><p>Sansa smiled and gave a quick nod. \u201cThe moment we got your letters we decided to plan this whole surprise. We knew you\u2019d try to make your way to Dragonstone after you came to King\u2019s Landing, so we decided to bring Dragonstone here, or rather its very important people, here.\u201d</p><p>Arya was in disbelief. Her family all in once place together again. It was nearly impossible to believe, yet here it was unfolding in front of her very eyes.</p><p>\u201cAnd Daenerys?\u201d Arya asked as they all started to take their seats around the table. Bran was at one side of the head while Sansa was at the other. Their significant others to the right of them while Tyrion, Jon, and herself took whatever seats remained.</p><p>\u201cShe putting the twins down to rest. They were quite rowdy on the boat ride here.\u201d Jon has said.</p><p>Arya nearly chocked on her wine, \u201cTwins? But the last letter I received from you said it only to be one babe, not two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, and if you had sent more letters like you should\u2019ve I would have been able to tell you that we had a twins.\u201d Jon said matter of fact.</p><p>Arya waved her hand dismissively , \u201cYes, yes. Sansa already told me I should\u2019ve written more often.\u201d</p><p>Smiles and laughter filled the small council room as the family ate. They were sharing their stories and adventures to Arya and she couldn\u2019t help but feel elated. She had truly missed this. For so long she had been alone and had been focused on her kill list that there was little room left for love and happiness. Now that it was all over and she could see the bright faces before her she started to believe that she could finally have all that she never thought she could.</p><p>\u201cSo Lord Tyrion, I\u2019ve heard my siblings life stories and what I missed these past years, but I haven\u2019t heard how your life is going. Please do enlighten me?\u201d Arya asked.</p><p>Tyrion took a sip of his wine; he was on his fourth cup. He cleared his throat and spoke.</p><p>\u201cWell, if you must know, I have married.\u201d</p><p>Arya\u2019s brows lifted in surprise. \u201cReally? Hmm won\u2019t this be your third?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd my last, I hope.\u201d He lifted his goblet to the Gods.</p><p>\u201cWell, who is she?\u201d Curiosity taking over Arya.</p><p>\u201cWell she ah-\u201c He was interrupted by a new voice that had joined the council room.</p><p>\u201cShe was one of my Dothraki hand maids.\u201d It was Daenerys that spoke. Arya hadn\u2019t noticed her enter the room.</p><p>Arya stood from her seat and greeted the former Dragon Queen with a small bow.</p><p>\u201cDaenerys. It\u2019s nice to see you\u2026on good terms.\u201d</p><p>Dany gave a small smile and quickly embraced the young assassin. Arya was surprised by the sudden gesture and wasn\u2019t sure how to respond. She hadn\u2019t been close to Dany, not even after Jon had talked her down from burning thousands of innocent people alive.</p><p>When Arya had left to travel, Dany\u2019s mental state was not in the best condition. She was still recovering from her losses and was paranoid that people where still trying to poison her.</p><p>From one of the few letters she had gotten from Jon, it took her time to recover. It wasn\u2019t until she found out that she a babe in her belly that she realized what was most important and ultimately giving up the throne to Bran.</p><p>Arya returned the embrace. She still wasn\u2019t sure how she felt about Daenerys Targaryen, but she did believe that, with time, they could become friends.</p><p>\u201cIt is good to see you too, Arya.\u201d Dany said as she let Arya go.</p><p>Arya returned to her seat and Dany sat beside Jon.</p><p>\u201cI am sorry I was late. I had to put the twins down for a nap. They were a little agitated on the boat ride here.\u201d Dany said as she took a bite of her food.</p><p>\u201cOh nonsense! I\u2019ll be in your shoes come four moons time.\u201d Sansa assured her.</p><p>Arya looked between the two ladies and was surprised by their interaction. The last time there were in the same room they wanted to kill each other. Now, they looked liked the best of friends, smiling and laughing with one another. It was almost sickening to Arya, but she had to remember that she had been gone for five years and that was plenty of time for them to strike a friendship.</p><p>\u201cSo tell me Arya, how were your travels? Find anything interesting?\u201d Dany asked her.</p><p>Arya washed her food down with the remainder of her wine before she spoke. \u201cNothing much, just a lot of sea and few small islands that had friendly natives. We did find a rather large mass of land that we mapped, but there weren\u2019t any people that we saw. Then after that we just sailed around Essos and stopped when we needed supplies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt sounds like you enjoyed yourself.\u201d Dany quipped.</p><p>Arya nodded, \u201cOh yeah! It was liberating. I had command of the ship and the men listened to me. But eventually I did miss home. That\u2019s why I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how long do you plan on staying?\u201d She asked her.</p><p>Arya was hoping no one would ask that damned question. She really didn\u2019t want to explain why she wasn\u2019t staying in King\u2019s Landing. The only one who knew her plans was deep into his fifth cup of wine. She glanced at him and he gave a small hiccup. He wiped his mouth of whatever wine may have spilled out of it and looked up at Arya, a grin covering his face.</p><p>\u201cOh yes! Please do tell us how long you are staying, Lady Stark! Was it two days or three? I can\u2019t quite remember what that navigator of yours said.\u201d His words were slightly slurred.</p><p>Arya shot daggers at the imp and swore that one day she would slit his throat in his sleep. </p><p>She could feel the many pairs of eyes lingering on her body, each with their own impending question. This is exactly why she wanted to keep it hush. She hated answering questions that she really didn\u2019t have an answer to and she had a feeling that she was about to receive plenty of them. </p><p>Sansa was the first, as always, to ask the question that undoubtedly on everyone\u2019s mind. </p><p>\u201cYou are not staying? Where are you going?\u201d Her tone was harsh but the hurt in her voice was undeniably recognizable. </p><p>\u201cI-\u201d She was cut off by Jon before she could answer he sister\u2019s question. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sailing again, aren\u2019t you? Haven\u2019t you had enough of the sea?\u201d </p><p>Arya\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cNo! No! I am not sailing again. I\u2019ve truly had enough of the high seas.\u201d She assured her family. </p><p>\u201cThen where are you going?\u201d Sansa asked once more. </p><p>Arya hesitated. She didn\u2019t want to tell them where she was going. She shouldn\u2019t have to, but if she didn\u2019t she knew her family would be hurt and didn\u2019t think that she could bear to see their weary faces. </p><p>With a sigh, Arya answered. \u201cI am staying in Westeros and I\u2019ll be back to King\u2019s Landing, I promise. I just have one more place to go to before I even begin to think about settling down.\u201d </p><p>She saw the tension in her family ease a bit. They truly believed that she would up a leave again and that broke her heart. She didn\u2019t want them to expect for her to leave. They knew she was a wanderer, but she had hoped they would believe her to stay. But she had been gone from for five years and perhaps they only knew her as she had been and as what she was now. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cAnd where is this place that you have to visit? Hmm? You haven\u2019t been any where else but Winterfell and King\u2019s Landing, so where else would you have to go?\u201d Her sister was becoming impatient due to the lack of answers that Arya was providing. </p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s not necessarily true. I have been to the Riverlands and Harrenhal, but that\u2019s another story.\u201d She said matter of fact. </p><p>Sansa face was starting to beam red. Arya\u2019s blatant disregard for answering her questions was becoming irritating. </p><p>\u201cArya! You know what I mean. Now please tell me where you are going.\u201d </p><p>Now Arya was the one becoming annoyed. She didn\u2019t want to answer her sister\u2019s questions, nor did she have to. She was a woman grown of twenty and three and didn\u2019t need to explain her reasonings. If her sister wanted to know the truth, she could go to their brother Bran, who seemed to have all the answers. </p><p>Arya crossed her arms over her chest and remained silent. She wasn\u2019t going to give her sister the satisfaction. Although, she couldn\u2019t say as much for the imp sitting beside her. </p><p>\u201cI think I can answer that as well.\u201d He hiccuped. </p><p>Arya turned to the imp, \u201cIf you say a single word, I will make sure that you never see tomorrow.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou are not a sprightly young lass are you?\u201d Tyrion inquired. </p><p>Arya instinctively reached for Cat\u2019s Paw, \u201cI\u2019ll me more than happy to show you sprightly.\u201d </p><p>Tyrion looked down at Arya\u2019s hand resting on the hilt of her dagger. He decided that today was not the day to be clever. \u201cI think I\u2019ve had too much wine. I will be retiring to my chambers and fucking my wife. See most of you all on the morrow.\u201d He lifted from his seat and turned to Bran and bowed, \u201cYour Grace.\u201d </p><p>Bran nodded and Tyrion waddled out of the council room with his goblet of wine in hand. </p><p>\u201cArya, you cannot threaten him like that. He is the Lord Hand of the seven kingdoms.:\u201d Sansa chastised. </p><p>Arya grumbled, \u201cI can threaten who I please.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhy are you so stubborn? Why can\u2019t you just tell me where you are going?\u201d Sansa tried again. </p><p>Arya\u2019s blood was boiling and she wasn\u2019t going to be able to keep her head any longer. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have to tell you where I am going! I am not telling you where I am going! It is my business! But,\u201d Arya calmed herself, \u201cI can promise you that I will be back in time for the birth of your babe.\u201d </p><p>Sansa\u2019s face was stoic. She gave a curt nod and said, \u201cThat is it then.\u201d and raised from her seat. \u201cCome, Pod. I no longer wish to squabble with my sister. I will see her when she returns from where ever she is going.\u201d </p><p>Pod gave Arya an apologetic look and helped Sansa out of the council room. </p><p>The remainder of the guest stayed silent. Meera was still munching in a half eaten piece of bread and Dany was whispering to Jon. The awkward tension that filled the air was becoming unbearable. </p><p>Bran was the one to break the silence. </p><p>\u201cMeera, why don\u2019t we retire for the night? I\u2019m sure Arya will enjoy her travels. Please do keep an open mind when you go see him, he has been through quite a bit in these last years.\u201d </p><p>Meera lifted from her seat and rolled Bran to the door. \u201cIt was nice meeting you, Arya.\u201d She told her as they exited. </p><p>Arya\u2019s eyes quickly locked with Jon\u2019s. He was going to ask her question when Dany intervened. \u201cLeave her be. She isn\u2019t answering any questions.\u201d Arya silently thanked her. She pushed her chair back and exited the council room, heading to her chambers. </p><p>She hated that, even now after all these years, Sansa was still in some small way trying to control her. But Arya wasn\u2019t that little girl that anymore, she hadn\u2019t been for a long time. </p><p>Arya was making her way to her chambers for the night to prepare for her journey to Storm\u2019s End when she heard giggling coming from a near by chamber room. She veered left instead of the right that she needed to take to head to her chambers. </p><p>The giggling sounded young and childish and there were distinctively two sets of giggles coming from the closed door that was facing her. Arya gently pushed the door open and saw two young girls no older than five namedays sitting in the middle of the room playing with their tiny wooden direwolves. One girl had dark black hair with dark eyes to match while the other had silver hair that shined like the moon; her eyes were a loveliest shade of violet that Arya had ever seen. </p><p>She knew right then and there those were her nieces that were born just a few moons after she had left on her journey. They were beautiful and no one could deny that they belonged to Dany and Jon. </p><p>\u201cThere are beautiful, are they not?\u201d A voice came from behind Arya. </p><p>She jumped and spun to see Daenerys staring at her. It was not easy to sneak up on Arya Stark, but Dany had done so, probably due to the fact Arya was so enticed with the twins that were in front of her. </p><p>\u201cThey are. What are their names?\u201d Asked Arya. </p><p>Dany smiled, \u201cThe one with hair like mine is named after my mother, Rhaella and the spitting image of Jon, Lyarya.\u201d </p><p>Arya chuckled at the name, \u201cWhy in seven hells would you name her Lyarya? I\u2019ve never even heard of it.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell, we wanted to name both of them after our mothers, but Jon feared that people would think that we named her after Lyanna Mormont, not Lyanna Stark. He also wanted to name her after his favorite sister, so we combined the names.\u201d </p><p>Arya\u2019s eyes grew in realization. Their child was named after her. But why? What had she done to have a child named after her? Why was she so special? </p><p>\u201cWe named her after you, not because you defeated the Night King or because you survived the Battle of King\u2019s Landing. We named her after you because you were unafraid to tell me that I was wrong. I remember that day like it happened a fortnight ago. It was several days after the Battle of King\u2019s Landing and I was still in a difficult place. Yes, your brother was able to convince me to not burn the city down, but it was you who came up to me and told me that if I ever had a moment in life where I willing chose to end thousands of innocent lives, that you would shut my eyes forever.\u201d Dany hesitated and Arya could see the emotion in her eyes. </p><p>\u201cNo one, not even my advisers had ever been so bold to say that to me. You, along with many other people, helped pull me out of my despair. So that is why we named her after you. Because you are beautiful and strong and never afraid to speak your mind.\u201d </p><p>Arya was truly touched by the words Dany had told her. She never thought that she was beautiful in any sort of way. But here this woman was, who was the definition of beauty, telling Arya Horseface that she was beautiful. It made her mind immediately jump to Gendry and the night after the Battle of Winterfell. He had told her she was beautiful and she didn\u2019t believe it. She didn\u2019t want to believe it. Now, she wishes that she had. </p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d She told Dany. </p><p>Dany gave her a smile and squeezed her shoulder gently. \u201cI know where you are going. Do not worry yourself, your secret is safe with me. But head Bran\u2019s warning; keep an open mind.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhat does that even mean? And how did you know?\u201d She asked her. </p><p>\u201cI may have not been myself five years ago, but I was still an observant woman. I know love when I see it. As for the warning, you\u2019ll come to find out Arya Stark of Winterfell.\u201d And with that Dany brushed passed her and entered the twins room, closing the door behind her. </p><p>Arya was more confused than ever and was wondering if going to Storm\u2019s End was such a good idea. You have nothing to worry about she assured herself. She was going to Storm\u2019s End on the morrow and no one was going to stop her. </p></p>",
                "content": "<p><h1>An Unexpected Journey: Part 4</h1><p>A wolf&rsquo;s den it was because sitting around the table with Sansa and Bran was her older brother Jon. Her breath had caught and her eyes went wide. This was more of a surprise than finding out Sansa was pregnant.</p><p>She immediately ran to him and jumped into his arms like she had nearly six years prior. His chuckle tickled her ear and she relaxed instantly in his grasp. She scarcely believed that he was here holding her.</p><p>&ldquo;What are you doing here?&rdquo; She asked as he let her down to the floor.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;re not the only one capable of surprises.&rdquo; He ruffled her hair as he spoke.</p><p>She pushed his hand away and playfully shoved him. Her eyes flicked to Sansa and she instantly knew.</p><p>&ldquo;You told him?&rdquo;</p><p>Sansa smiled and gave a quick nod. &ldquo;The moment we got your letters we decided to plan this whole surprise. We knew you&rsquo;d try to make your way to Dragonstone after you came to King&rsquo;s Landing, so we decided to bring Dragonstone here, or rather its very important people, here.&rdquo;</p><p>Arya was in disbelief. Her family all in once place together again. It was nearly impossible to believe, yet here it was unfolding in front of her very eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;And Daenerys?&rdquo; Arya asked as they all started to take their seats around the table. Bran was at one side of the head while Sansa was at the other. Their significant others to the right of them while Tyrion, Jon, and herself took whatever seats remained.</p><p>&ldquo;She putting the twins down to rest. They were quite rowdy on the boat ride here.&rdquo; Jon has said.</p><p>Arya nearly chocked on her wine, &ldquo;Twins? But the last letter I received from you said it only to be one babe, not two.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Aye, and if you had sent more letters like you should&rsquo;ve I would have been able to tell you that we had a twins.&rdquo; Jon said matter of fact.</p><p>Arya waved her hand dismissively , &ldquo;Yes, yes. Sansa already told me I should&rsquo;ve written more often.&rdquo;</p><p>Smiles and laughter filled the small council room as the family ate. They were sharing their stories and adventures to Arya and she couldn&rsquo;t help but feel elated. She had truly missed this. For so long she had been alone and had been focused on her kill list that there was little room left for love and happiness. Now that it was all over and she could see the bright faces before her she started to believe that she could finally have all that she never thought she could.</p><p>&ldquo;So Lord Tyrion, I&rsquo;ve heard my siblings life stories and what I missed these past years, but I haven&rsquo;t heard how your life is going. Please do enlighten me?&rdquo; Arya asked.</p><p>Tyrion took a sip of his wine; he was on his fourth cup. He cleared his throat and spoke.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, if you must know, I have married.&rdquo;</p><p>Arya&rsquo;s brows lifted in surprise. &ldquo;Really? Hmm won&rsquo;t this be your third?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And my last, I hope.&rdquo; He lifted his goblet to the Gods.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, who is she?&rdquo; Curiosity taking over Arya.</p><p>&ldquo;Well she ah-&ldquo; He was interrupted by a new voice that had joined the council room.</p><p>&ldquo;She was one of my Dothraki hand maids.&rdquo; It was Daenerys that spoke. Arya hadn&rsquo;t noticed her enter the room.</p><p>Arya stood from her seat and greeted the former Dragon Queen with a small bow.</p><p>&ldquo;Daenerys. It&rsquo;s nice to see you&hellip;on good terms.&rdquo;</p><p>Dany gave a small smile and quickly embraced the young assassin. Arya was surprised by the sudden gesture and wasn&rsquo;t sure how to respond. She hadn&rsquo;t been close to Dany, not even after Jon had talked her down from burning thousands of innocent people alive.</p><p>When Arya had left to travel, Dany&rsquo;s mental state was not in the best condition. She was still recovering from her losses and was paranoid that people where still trying to poison her.</p><p>From one of the few letters she had gotten from Jon, it took her time to recover. It wasn&rsquo;t until she found out that she a babe in her belly that she realized what was most important and ultimately giving up the throne to Bran.</p><p>Arya returned the embrace. She still wasn&rsquo;t sure how she felt about Daenerys Targaryen, but she did believe that, with time, they could become friends.</p><p>&ldquo;It is good to see you too, Arya.&rdquo; Dany said as she let Arya go.</p><p>Arya returned to her seat and Dany sat beside Jon.</p><p>&ldquo;I am sorry I was late. I had to put the twins down for a nap. They were a little agitated on the boat ride here.&rdquo; Dany said as she took a bite of her food.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh nonsense! I&rsquo;ll be in your shoes come four moons time.&rdquo; Sansa assured her.</p><p>Arya looked between the two ladies and was surprised by their interaction. The last time there were in the same room they wanted to kill each other. Now, they looked liked the best of friends, smiling and laughing with one another. It was almost sickening to Arya, but she had to remember that she had been gone for five years and that was plenty of time for them to strike a friendship.</p><p>&ldquo;So tell me Arya, how were your travels? Find anything interesting?&rdquo; Dany asked her.</p><p>Arya washed her food down with the remainder of her wine before she spoke. &ldquo;Nothing much, just a lot of sea and few small islands that had friendly natives. We did find a rather large mass of land that we mapped, but there weren&rsquo;t any people that we saw. Then after that we just sailed around Essos and stopped when we needed supplies.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It sounds like you enjoyed yourself.&rdquo; Dany quipped.</p><p>Arya nodded, &ldquo;Oh yeah! It was liberating. I had command of the ship and the men listened to me. But eventually I did miss home. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m here.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And how long do you plan on staying?&rdquo; She asked her.</p><p>Arya was hoping no one would ask that damned question. She really didn&rsquo;t want to explain why she wasn&rsquo;t staying in King&rsquo;s Landing. The only one who knew her plans was deep into his fifth cup of wine. She glanced at him and he gave a small hiccup. He wiped his mouth of whatever wine may have spilled out of it and looked up at Arya, a grin covering his face.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh yes! Please do tell us how long you are staying, Lady Stark! Was it two days or three? I can&rsquo;t quite remember what that navigator of yours said.&rdquo; His words were slightly slurred.</p><p>Arya shot daggers at the imp and swore that one day she would slit his throat in his sleep. </p><p>She could feel the many pairs of eyes lingering on her body, each with their own impending question. This is exactly why she wanted to keep it hush. She hated answering questions that she really didn&rsquo;t have an answer to and she had a feeling that she was about to receive plenty of them. </p><p>Sansa was the first, as always, to ask the question that undoubtedly on everyone&rsquo;s mind. </p><p>&ldquo;You are not staying? Where are you going?&rdquo; Her tone was harsh but the hurt in her voice was undeniably recognizable. </p><p>&ldquo;I-&rdquo; She was cut off by Jon before she could answer he sister&rsquo;s question. </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re sailing again, aren&rsquo;t you? Haven&rsquo;t you had enough of the sea?&rdquo; </p><p>Arya&rsquo;s eyes widened. &ldquo;No! No! I am not sailing again. I&rsquo;ve truly had enough of the high seas.&rdquo; She assured her family. </p><p>&ldquo;Then where are you going?&rdquo; Sansa asked once more. </p><p>Arya hesitated. She didn&rsquo;t want to tell them where she was going. She shouldn&rsquo;t have to, but if she didn&rsquo;t she knew her family would be hurt and didn&rsquo;t think that she could bear to see their weary faces. </p><p>With a sigh, Arya answered. &ldquo;I am staying in Westeros and I&rsquo;ll be back to King&rsquo;s Landing, I promise. I just have one more place to go to before I even begin to think about settling down.&rdquo; </p><p>She saw the tension in her family ease a bit. They truly believed that she would up a leave again and that broke her heart. She didn&rsquo;t want them to expect for her to leave. They knew she was a wanderer, but she had hoped they would believe her to stay. But she had been gone from for five years and perhaps they only knew her as she had been and as what she was now. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;And where is this place that you have to visit? Hmm? You haven&rsquo;t been any where else but Winterfell and King&rsquo;s Landing, so where else would you have to go?&rdquo; Her sister was becoming impatient due to the lack of answers that Arya was providing. </p><p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s not necessarily true. I have been to the Riverlands and Harrenhal, but that&rsquo;s another story.&rdquo; She said matter of fact. </p><p>Sansa face was starting to beam red. Arya&rsquo;s blatant disregard for answering her questions was becoming irritating. </p><p>&ldquo;Arya! You know what I mean. Now please tell me where you are going.&rdquo; </p><p>Now Arya was the one becoming annoyed. She didn&rsquo;t want to answer her sister&rsquo;s questions, nor did she have to. She was a woman grown of twenty and three and didn&rsquo;t need to explain her reasonings.

He is the Lord Hand of the seven kingdoms.:&rdquo; Sansa chastised. </p><p>Arya grumbled, &ldquo;I can threaten who I please.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Why are you so stubborn? Why can&rsquo;t you just tell me where you are going?&rdquo; Sansa tried again. </p><p>Arya&rsquo;s blood was boiling and she wasn&rsquo;t going to be able to keep her head any longer. </p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have to tell you where I am going!

I will see her when she returns from where ever she is going.&rdquo; </p><p>Pod gave Arya an apologetic look and helped Sansa out of the council room. </p><p>The remainder of the guest stayed silent.
