        "body": "<p>I\u2019m a happy camper this Christmas as I finally got Game of Thrones season 7 for myself. And I was surprised when it came with this beautiful little DVD that contains an over 40 minute history of the Targaryens in Westeros, narrated by several of the characters in Game of Thrones including: Viserys, Varys, Euron, Peytr Baelish, Sansa, and Jaime. I say characters and not actors because it is clearly supposed to be from the perspective of the characters and what they have learned about the history of the Targaryens.</p><p>Now, I was intrigued to watch this because I am actually midway through a big ol\u2019 post on unreliable history in Fire and Blood. The basic thesis is that by telling the history of his world through the eyes of someone in that world, he makes it unreliable and biased and this is very much by design. I have my ideas about what is exagerated vs what is real in Fire and Blood, but I wanted to see how this video compared. Especially since it contains what the SHOW views as the most important notes in the Targaryen conquest.</p><p>And boy did it confirm my suspicions about unreliable history. In fact, hearing individual characters bring in their bias illustrated my thesis perfectly. But let\u2019s talk about some of the highlights. Because I was surprised to see how the Targaryens were represented her.</p><p>1. Viserys suggests that the Targaryens may have left Old Valyria because of a court mishap and not the prophesy from\u00a0\u2018The Dreamer\u2019. I have had my suspicions about some of the\u00a0\u201cprophetical\u201d motivation behind the Targaryen conquest, because in large part it seemed like stories written to justify Aegon\u2019s conquest. Like it\u2019s his\u00a0\u201cdestiny\u201d. However, I never thought to question the idea of the dreamer foreseeing the doom of Valyria. Now, if this was from any other character\u2019s narration I might call it unreliable and an attempt to discredit the Targaryens but this is Viserys, \u201cnumber one Targaryen fanboy\u201d, \u201cmy family is the best and like GODS among MEN\u201d Targaryen. Even he thinks that perhaps the vision is just a story. At the very least, the vision wasn\u2019t super clear as the Targaryens left a full twelve years before the Doom. Already the show seems to be calling attention to the fact that the Targaryens are just like everyone else.</p><p>2. This continues with the implication that Aegon conquered for resources and knew he could win because of dragons. This is also Viserys\u2019 implication. He also makes a statement about Aegon \u201cteaching the squabbling families the meaning of greatness\u201d and it sounds very villainy. Again. This is Viserys who later on calls Maegar the cruel,\u00a0\u201cthe wise\u201d and says the title of cruel was slander! Viserys is 100% team Targaryen and yet he does not begin to make Aegon\u2019s intentions sound noble. Even though the Targaryen history books are FILLED with that kind of thing. Viserys also calls them\u00a0\u201cstrangers\u201d to Westeros which follows the narrative of this being an invasion. in fact the next section is even TITLED\u00a0\u2018invasion\u2019</p><p>After this, we switch to Varys\u2019 narration. As a narrator, he\u2019s probs the most trustworthy as he is the most neutral. And HE adds in the suggestion that Aegon used the hands of the envoy sent to him by Argilac the arrogant were just a PRETEXT for the conquest he\u2019d been planning for a long time. He wanted to rule the seven kingdoms and was just looking for an excuse to attack. He also suggests that Argilac the arrogant was surpassed by Aegon in arrogance. Not a great picture painted of Aegon.</p><p>3. \u201cBefore he was done, the rivers fields and skies would turn red\u201d &ndash; Varys on Aegon the conqueror. Continues to speak of this man like a villain. in sharp contrast to the\u00a0\u2018noble conqueror\u2019 painted in Fire and Blood. Speaking of which, Aegon is the one who comes up with the words\u00a0\u2018Fire and Blood\u2019 according to this video, which definetily makes him seem like he was hoping for some casual mass murder.</p><p>4. Obviously, Harren the Black and Argilac the Arrogant sucked. Totally not coming to their defense. But how are their deaths portrated. Well, Euron is given the chance to describe the death of Harren and he is CLEARLY\u00a0turned on by the destruction of his ancestors which is a bad sign. It\u2019s description is horrifying and the animation is dark. Obviously if Euron likes it, its supposed to be kind of freaky.</p><p>Argilac, however, is given a heroic final battle seeming almost noble. Orys Baratheon, the most humanized of all the conquerors, seems to respect him enough to take his sigil and words\u00a0\u201cout of respect\u201d. We\u2019ll talk more about how the characters are drawn later, but there\u2019s a big difference between Orys and Aegon.</p><p>5. Jaime describes the field of fire and he himself looks VERY MUCH like Lorren Lannister. He stresses that Aegon had\u00a0\u201cno mercy\u201d. But its no surprise that he hates Targaryens cause they have a bad history. But still, the Field of Fire is shot like a horrifying war scene and the Targaryens are again depicted as the villain. Thousands return home as\u00a0\u201cscarred monsters\u201d.</p><p>Favorite line\u00a0\u201cAegon had a fetish for collecting swords\u201d.</p><p>6. Sansa narrates the bits about House Stark and House Stark is indisputidly depicted as heroes. Now, this isn\u2019t surprising. Sansa is loyal to her house. But she implies that the north was different than the other kingdoms because they were focused on survival not power. There is focus for a lot of time on the white walkers and how it is a Stark problem to deal with and they are a greater threat than dragons.</p><p>She puts emphasis on how Starks are willing to make alliances for survival, regadless of pride as well. She seems to respect Torrhen Stark\u2019s decision to kneel saying\u00a0\u2018he had no choice\u2019. Aegon was offering a very\u00a0\u2018kneel or die\u2019 message after all. The Starks would have died if they did not bow. But their swords are still taken for the throne!</p><p>The most ominous bit is this:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cThe swords Aegon took from them were not twisted or mangled\u201d - Sansa </p><p>\u201cYet\u201d - Viserys, very ominously</p></blockquote><p>What an ominous thing to throw in there Viserys!</p><p>7. Most unsettling display of Targaryen villainy happens in the Eyrie, narrated by Littlefinger. Queen Arryn arrives to see that Visenya is with her son, next to her dragon. Visenya doesn\u2019t say it, but she is fully threatening the boy. You can see it by her smile which is just&hellip;oof. It\u2019s scary. She clearly intends to kill him if his mother doesn\u2019t give the crown. She has \u201cno choice\u201d and Littlefinger describes him as a \u201cpoor boy\u201d. Visenya is clear villain in this. This is in HUGE contrast to the two women apparently relating and connecting with each other in Fire and Blood.</p><p>8. Viserys mocks the \u201creligious\u201d reasons for old town\u2019s surrender suggesting that they knelt because otherwise everyone would die. This once again undercuts the idea that the septon saw some grand purpose for Aegon which is suggested in Fire and Blood. The septon is just afraid, again, according to Viserys the number one Targaryen fanboy. Bonus: calls the north savages because Targaryens are better than everyone~~ He even calls the Targaryens the\u00a0&quot;Greatest dynasty ever.\u201d when Aegon is crowned.</p><p>9. But after Aegon\u2019s victory, the neutral Varys comes in to remind us of the Dorne failure. Rather than making Rhaenys seem unflapable and invincible as Fire and Blood did, Varys suggested that the yellow toad of Dorne SCARED Rhaenys. And later on, of course, Rhaenys gets taken down. Dorne really is painted as the heroic underdogs of this scene. and emphasis is placed on the fact that Aegon and Visenya set every city on fire except sunspear. If there HAD been people there, they would all be dead. Fire and Blood indeed.</p><p>10. We skip right from the conquest to the Dance of Dragons.</p><blockquote><p>\u201cWith no enemies left they started fighting each other.\u201d - Viserys</p></blockquote><p>This defs doesn\u2019t sound like the centuries of peace and prosperity that Dany talked about. This video is focused ENTIRELY on the wars of the Targaryens and not the good things or building of infrastructure. No mention of Jahaerys the concilitator at all. Instead we focus on Aegon, Maegar, the Dance, Aegon the Unworthy and the Mad King. All the very worst Targaryens. And there are lots of good things the Targaryens did! But instead of focusing on that, the show focuses on the war, which means they know that Dany\u2019s line about\u00a0\u201ccenturies of peace\u201d is wrong.</p><p>Bonus, we have more of Viserys arguing for blood purity and that Targaryens are SPECIAL and that they would have been fine if Aegon didn\u2019t legitimize so many dirty half breed bastards.</p><p>11. The greatest Targaryen threat, however, is madness (according to Jaime who saw the Mad King first hand). We bring up that line again: \u201cEvery time a Targaryen is born the gods flip a coin\u201d</p><blockquote><p>\u201cWe put up with Aerys hoping Rhaegar would be better but then he also proved mad when he took Lyanna Stark\u201d<br/></p></blockquote><p>This does not place Rhaegar as the sane, good sibling most people do. Instead, it also paints him in a negative light. Which, this is Jaime, so take it with a grain of salt. But he actually never hated Rhaegar so yeah&hellip;</p><p>12. Jaime is so bitter about Ned condemning him and it\u2019s kinda funny. I love Nikolaj narration</p><blockquote><p>\u201cI saw what Ned Stark couldn\u2019t. Robert was ashamed of the bodies of the children&hellip; and more ashamed at his relief. Glorious heroes didn\u2019t kill children. They simply didn\u2019t punish their murderers\u201d - Jaime being smart with one of my fave lines.</p></blockquote><p>He clearly sees things as they are. He doesn\u2019t like the Targaryens but he also doesn\u2019t elevate Robert as a god. Jaime doesn\u2019t believe in heroes and it shows here.</p><p>13. Then we end with a particularly ominous note.</p><blockquote><p>\u201cOne day I\u2019ll return and repay all traitors with the only coin my family knows. Fire and blood\u201d - Viserys.\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>These are the last words in the video. A threat. It really does not paint the Targaryens as tragic characters pushed out of their rightful throne.</p><p>And this is where I want to talk about the character drawings. Every pose from the original three dragons (Aegon and sisters) is the most villainous thing in the world and the music behind their conquest is intense and dark. Their faces are often lowered but with their eyes glaring up and shrouded in shadow. Their smiles are sharp. Their body language is arrogant. It is victims of the conquest like Lorren and Torrhen who are given more humanized designs.</p><p>On the Targaryen side of things, the most humanized design belongs to Orys Baratheon who has much kinder eyes and a more open expression. And the there\u2019s Viserys and Daenerys at the end who look like scared children more than anything. But the Targaryen dynasty that is their birth right doesn\u2019t appear to start out on a great foot.</p><p>This kinda all backs up my point that if Daenerys wants to break the wheel, she will have to reject and correct the legacy of her family. The show clearly does not view Aegon as a great hero. So if they mean for Daenerys to be a hero, I hope they have her recognize the history and take steps to correct it (maybe even destroy the iron throne, plz?) And if she doesn\u2019t recognize her history or tries to emulate Aegon, she could be headed down a bad path.</p><p>I love the Targaryen family because, like lots of my favorite Westeros families, they are SCREWED UP and have lots of interesting characters, and I look forward to exploring them more in my Fire and Blood post. But if anything, this video just backs up my thesis about unreliable history and what Dany will have to do if she wants to be a good ruler. Break that wheel! It was forged in fire and blood!</p>",

Already the show seems to be calling attention to the fact that the Targaryens are just like everyone else.</p><p>2. This continues with the implication that Aegon conquered for resources and knew he could win because of dragons. This is also Viserys\u2019 implication. He also makes a statement about Aegon \u201cteaching the squabbling families the meaning of greatness\u201d and it sounds very villainy. Again. This is Viserys who later on calls Maegar the cruel,\u00a0\u201cthe wise\u201d and says the title of cruel was slander! Viserys is 100% team Targaryen and yet he does not begin to make Aegon\u2019s intentions sound noble. Even though the Targaryen history books are FILLED with that kind of thing. Viserys also calls them\u00a0\u201cstrangers\u201d to Westeros which follows the narrative of this being an invasion. in fact the next section is even TITLED\u00a0\u2018invasion\u2019</p><p>After this, we switch to Varys\u2019 narration. As a narrator, he\u2019s probs the most trustworthy as he is the most neutral. And HE adds in the suggestion that Aegon used the hands of the envoy sent to him by Argilac the arrogant were just a PRETEXT for the conquest he\u2019d been planning for a long time. He wanted to rule the seven kingdoms and was just looking for an excuse to attack. He also suggests that Argilac the arrogant was surpassed by Aegon in arrogance. Not a great picture painted of Aegon.</p><p>3. \u201cBefore he was done, the rivers fields and skies would turn red\u201d \u2013 Varys on Aegon the conqueror. Continues to speak of this man like a villain. in sharp contrast to the\u00a0\u2018noble conqueror\u2019 painted in Fire and Blood. Speaking of which, Aegon is the one who comes up with the words\u00a0\u2018Fire and Blood\u2019 according to this video, which definetily makes him seem like he was hoping for some casual mass murder.</p><p>4. Obviously, Harren the Black and Argilac the Arrogant sucked. Totally not coming to their defense. But how are their deaths portrated. Well, Euron is given the chance to describe the death of Harren and he is CLEARLY\u00a0turned on by the destruction of his ancestors which is a bad sign. It\u2019s description is horrifying and the animation is dark. Obviously if Euron likes it, its supposed to be kind of freaky.</p><p>Argilac, however, is given a heroic final battle seeming almost noble. Orys Baratheon, the most humanized of all the conquerors, seems to respect him enough to take his sigil and words\u00a0\u201cout of respect\u201d. We\u2019ll talk more about how the characters are drawn later, but there\u2019s a big difference between Orys and Aegon.</p><p>5. Jaime describes the field of fire and he himself looks VERY MUCH like Lorren Lannister. He stresses that Aegon had\u00a0\u201cno mercy\u201d. But its no surprise that he hates Targaryens cause they have a bad history. But still, the Field of Fire is shot like a horrifying war scene and the Targaryens are again depicted as the villain. Thousands return home as\u00a0\u201cscarred monsters\u201d.</p><p>Favorite line\u00a0\u201cAegon had a fetish for collecting swords\u201d.</p><p>6. Sansa narrates the bits about House Stark and House Stark is indisputidly depicted as heroes. Now, this isn\u2019t surprising. Sansa is loyal to her house. But she implies that the north was different than the other kingdoms because they were focused on survival not power. There is focus for a lot of time on the white walkers and how it is a Stark problem to deal with and they are a greater threat than dragons.</p><p>She puts emphasis on how Starks are willing to make alliances for survival, regadless of pride as well. She seems to respect Torrhen Stark\u2019s decision to kneel saying\u00a0\u2018he had no choice\u2019. Aegon was offering a very\u00a0\u2018kneel or die\u2019 message after all. The Starks would have died if they did not bow. But their swords are still taken for the throne!</p><p>The most ominous bit is this:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cThe swords Aegon took from them were not twisted or mangled\u201d - Sansa </p><p>\u201cYet\u201d - Viserys, very ominously</p></blockquote><p>What an ominous thing to throw in there Viserys!</p><p>7. Most unsettling display of Targaryen villainy happens in the Eyrie, narrated by Littlefinger. Queen Arryn arrives to see that Visenya is with her son, next to her dragon. Visenya doesn\u2019t say it, but she is fully threatening the boy. You can see it by her smile which is just\u2026oof. It\u2019s scary. She clearly intends to kill him if his mother doesn\u2019t give the crown. She has \u201cno choice\u201d and Littlefinger describes him as a \u201cpoor boy\u201d. Visenya is clear villain in this. This is in HUGE contrast to the two women apparently relating and connecting with each other in Fire and Blood.</p><p>8. Viserys mocks the \u201creligious\u201d reasons for old town\u2019s surrender suggesting that they knelt because otherwise everyone would die. This once again undercuts the idea that the septon saw some grand purpose for Aegon which is suggested in Fire and Blood. The septon is just afraid, again, according to Viserys the number one Targaryen fanboy. Bonus: calls the north savages because Targaryens are better than everyone~~ He even calls the Targaryens the\u00a0\"Greatest dynasty ever.\u201d when Aegon is crowned.</p><p>9. But after Aegon\u2019s victory, the neutral Varys comes in to remind us of the Dorne failure. Rather than making Rhaenys seem unflapable and invincible as Fire and Blood did, Varys suggested that the yellow toad of Dorne SCARED Rhaenys. And later on, of course, Rhaenys gets taken down. Dorne really is painted as the heroic underdogs of this scene. and emphasis is placed on the fact that Aegon and Visenya set every city on fire except sunspear. If there HAD been people there, they would all be dead. Fire and Blood indeed.</p><p>10. We skip right from the conquest to the Dance of Dragons.</p><blockquote><p>\u201cWith no enemies left they started fighting each other.\u201d - Viserys</p></blockquote><p>This defs doesn\u2019t sound like the centuries of peace and prosperity that Dany talked about. This video is focused ENTIRELY on the wars of the Targaryens and not the good things or building of infrastructure. No mention of Jahaerys the concilitator at all. Instead we focus on Aegon, Maegar, the Dance, Aegon the Unworthy and the Mad King. All the very worst Targaryens. And there are lots of good things the Targaryens did! But instead of focusing on that, the show focuses on the war, which means they know that Dany\u2019s line about\u00a0\u201ccenturies of peace\u201d is wrong.</p><p>Bonus, we have more of Viserys arguing for blood purity and that Targaryens are SPECIAL and that they would have been fine if Aegon didn\u2019t legitimize so many dirty half breed bastards.</p><p>11. The greatest Targaryen threat, however, is madness (according to Jaime who saw the Mad King first hand). We bring up that line again: \u201cEvery time a Targaryen is born the gods flip a coin\u201d</p><blockquote><p>\u201cWe put up with Aerys hoping Rhaegar would be better but then he also proved mad when he took Lyanna Stark\u201d<br></p></blockquote><p>This does not place Rhaegar as the sane, good sibling most people do. Instead, it also paints him in a negative light. Which, this is Jaime, so take it with a grain of salt. But he actually never hated Rhaegar so yeah\u2026</p><p>12. Jaime is so bitter about Ned condemning him and it\u2019s kinda funny. I love Nikolaj narration</p><blockquote><p>\u201cI saw what Ned Stark couldn\u2019t. Robert was ashamed of the bodies of the children\u2026 and more ashamed at his relief. Glorious heroes didn\u2019t kill children. They simply didn\u2019t punish their murderers\u201d - Jaime being smart with one of my fave lines.</p></blockquote><p>He clearly sees things as they are. He doesn\u2019t like the Targaryens but he also doesn\u2019t elevate Robert as a god. Jaime doesn\u2019t believe in heroes and it shows here.</p><p>13. Then we end with a particularly ominous note.</p><blockquote><p>\u201cOne day I\u2019ll return and repay all traitors with the only coin my family knows. Fire and blood\u201d - Viserys.\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>These are the last words in the video. A threat. It really does not paint the Targaryens as tragic characters pushed out of their rightful throne.</p><p>And this is where I want to talk about the character drawings. Every pose from the original three dragons (Aegon and sisters) is the most villainous thing in the world and the music behind their conquest is intense and dark. Their faces are often lowered but with their eyes glaring up and shrouded in shadow. Their smiles are sharp. Their body language is arrogant. It is victims of the conquest like Lorren and Torrhen who are given more humanized designs.</p><p>On the Targaryen side of things, the most humanized design belongs to Orys Baratheon who has much kinder eyes and a more open expression. And the there\u2019s Viserys and Daenerys at the end who look like scared children more than anything. But the Targaryen dynasty that is their birth right doesn\u2019t appear to start out on a great foot.</p><p>This kinda all backs up my point that if Daenerys wants to break the wheel, she will have to reject and correct the legacy of her family. The show clearly does not view Aegon as a great hero. So if they mean for Daenerys to be a hero, I hope they have her recognize the history and take steps to correct it (maybe even destroy the iron throne, plz?) And if she doesn\u2019t recognize her history or tries to emulate Aegon, she could be headed down a bad path.</p><p>I love the Targaryen family because, like lots of my favorite Westeros families, they are SCREWED UP and have lots of interesting characters, and I look forward to exploring them more in my Fire and Blood post. But if anything, this video just backs up my thesis about unreliable history and what Dany will have to do if she wants to be a good ruler. Break that wheel! It was forged in fire and blood!</p>",

And I was surprised when it came with this beautiful little DVD that contains an over 40 minute history of the Targaryens in Westeros, narrated by several of the characters in Game of Thrones including: Viserys, Varys, Euron, Peytr Baelish, Sansa, and Jaime. I say characters and not actors because it is clearly supposed to be from the perspective of the characters and what they have learned about the history of the Targaryens.</p><p>Now, I was intrigued to watch this because I am actually midway through a big ol\u2019 post on unreliable history in Fire and Blood. The basic thesis is that by telling the history of his world through the eyes of someone in that world, he makes it unreliable and biased and this is very much by design. I have my ideas about what is exagerated vs what is real in Fire and Blood, but I wanted to see how this video compared. Especially since it contains what the SHOW views as the most important notes in the Targaryen conquest.</p><p>And boy did it confirm my suspicions about unreliable history. In fact, hearing individual characters bring in their bias illustrated my thesis perfectly. But let\u2019s talk about some of the highlights. Because I was surprised to see how the Targaryens were represented her.</p><p>1. Viserys suggests that the Targaryens may have left Old Valyria because of a court mishap and not the prophesy from\u00a0\u2018The Dreamer\u2019. I have had my suspicions about some of the\u00a0\u201cprophetical\u201d motivation behind the Targaryen conquest, because in large part it seemed like stories written to justify Aegon\u2019s conquest. Like it\u2019s his\u00a0\u201cdestiny\u201d. However, I never thought to question the idea of the dreamer foreseeing the doom of Valyria.

Now, if this was from any other character&rsquo;s narration I might call it unreliable and an attempt to discredit the Targaryens but this is Viserys, &ldquo;number one Targaryen fanboy&rdquo;, &ldquo;my family is the best and like GODS among MEN&rdquo; Targaryen. Even he thinks that perhaps the vision is just a story. At the very least, the vision wasn&rsquo;t super clear as the Targaryens left a full twelve years before the Doom. Already the show seems to be calling attention to the fact that the Targaryens are just like everyone else.</p><p>2. This continues with the implication that Aegon conquered for resources and knew he could win because of dragons. This is also Viserys&rsquo; implication. He also makes a statement about Aegon &ldquo;teaching the squabbling families the meaning of greatness&rdquo; and it sounds very villainy. Again. This is Viserys who later on calls Maegar the cruel,&nbsp;&ldquo;the wise&rdquo; and says the title of cruel was slander! Viserys is 100% team Targaryen and yet he does not begin to make Aegon&rsquo;s intentions sound noble. Even though the Targaryen history books are FILLED with that kind of thing. Viserys also calls them&nbsp;&ldquo;strangers&rdquo; to Westeros which follows the narrative of this being an invasion. in fact the next section is even TITLED&nbsp;&lsquo;invasion&rsquo;</p><p>After this, we switch to Varys&rsquo; narration. As a narrator, he&rsquo;s probs the most trustworthy as he is the most neutral. And HE adds in the suggestion that Aegon used the hands of the envoy sent to him by Argilac the arrogant were just a PRETEXT for the conquest he&rsquo;d been planning for a long time. He wanted to rule the seven kingdoms and was just looking for an excuse to attack. He also suggests that Argilac the arrogant was surpassed by Aegon in arrogance. Not a great picture painted of Aegon.</p><p>3. &ldquo;Before he was done, the rivers fields and skies would turn red&rdquo; &ndash; Varys on Aegon the conqueror. Continues to speak of this man like a villain. in sharp contrast to the&nbsp;&lsquo;noble conqueror&rsquo; painted in Fire and Blood. Speaking of which, Aegon is the one who comes up with the words&nbsp;&lsquo;Fire and Blood&rsquo; according to this video, which definetily makes him seem like he was hoping for some casual mass murder.</p><p>4. Obviously, Harren the Black and Argilac the Arrogant sucked. Totally not coming to their defense. But how are their deaths portrated. Well, Euron is given the chance to describe the death of Harren and he is CLEARLY&nbsp;turned on by the destruction of his ancestors which is a bad sign. It&rsquo;s description is horrifying and the animation is dark. Obviously if Euron likes it, its supposed to be kind of freaky.</p><p>Argilac, however, is given a heroic final battle seeming almost noble. Orys Baratheon, the most humanized of all the conquerors, seems to respect him enough to take his sigil and words&nbsp;&ldquo;out of respect&rdquo;. We&rsquo;ll talk more about how the characters are drawn later, but there&rsquo;s a big difference between Orys and Aegon.</p><p>5. Jaime describes the field of fire and he himself looks VERY MUCH like Lorren Lannister. He stresses that Aegon had&nbsp;&ldquo;no mercy&rdquo;. But its no surprise that he hates Targaryens cause they have a bad history. But still, the Field of Fire is shot like a horrifying war scene and the Targaryens are again depicted as the villain. Thousands return home as&nbsp;&ldquo;scarred monsters&rdquo;.</p><p>Favorite line&nbsp;&ldquo;Aegon had a fetish for collecting swords&rdquo;.</p><p>6. Sansa narrates the bits about House Stark and House Stark is indisputidly depicted as heroes. Now, this isn&rsquo;t surprising. Sansa is loyal to her house. But she implies that the north was different than the other kingdoms because they were focused on survival not power. There is focus for a lot of time on the white walkers and how it is a Stark problem to deal with and they are a greater threat than dragons.</p><p>She puts emphasis on how Starks are willing to make alliances for survival, regadless of pride as well. She seems to respect Torrhen Stark&rsquo;s decision to kneel saying&nbsp;&lsquo;he had no choice&rsquo;. Aegon was offering a very&nbsp;&lsquo;kneel or die&rsquo; message after all. The Starks would have died if they did not bow. But their swords are still taken for the throne!</p><p>The most ominous bit is this:</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;The swords Aegon took from them were not twisted or mangled&rdquo; - Sansa </p><p>&ldquo;Yet&rdquo; - Viserys, very ominously</p></blockquote><p>What an ominous thing to throw in there Viserys!</p><p>7. Most unsettling display of Targaryen villainy happens in the Eyrie, narrated by Littlefinger. Queen Arryn arrives to see that Visenya is with her son, next to her dragon. Visenya doesn&rsquo;t say it, but she is fully threatening the boy. You can see it by her smile which is just&hellip;oof. It&rsquo;s scary. She clearly intends to kill him if his mother doesn&rsquo;t give the crown. She has &ldquo;no choice&rdquo; and Littlefinger describes him as a &ldquo;poor boy&rdquo;. Visenya is clear villain in this. This is in HUGE contrast to the two women apparently relating and connecting with each other in Fire and Blood.</p><p>8. Viserys mocks the &ldquo;religious&rdquo; reasons for old town&rsquo;s surrender suggesting that they knelt because otherwise everyone would die. This once again undercuts the idea that the septon saw some grand purpose for Aegon which is suggested in Fire and Blood. The septon is just afraid, again, according to Viserys the number one Targaryen fanboy. Bonus: calls the north savages because Targaryens are better than everyone~~ He even calls the Targaryens the&nbsp;\"Greatest dynasty ever.&rdquo; when Aegon is crowned.</p><p>9. But after Aegon&rsquo;s victory, the neutral Varys comes in to remind us of the Dorne failure. Rather than making Rhaenys seem unflapable and invincible as Fire and Blood did, Varys suggested that the yellow toad of Dorne SCARED Rhaenys. And later on, of course, Rhaenys gets taken down. Dorne really is painted as the heroic underdogs of this scene. and emphasis is placed on the fact that Aegon and Visenya set every city on fire except sunspear. If there HAD been people there, they would all be dead. Fire and Blood indeed.</p><p>10. We skip right from the conquest to the Dance of Dragons.</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;With no enemies left they started fighting each other.&rdquo; - Viserys</p></blockquote><p>This defs doesn&rsquo;t sound like the centuries of peace and prosperity that Dany talked about. This video is focused ENTIRELY on the wars of the Targaryens and not the good things or building of infrastructure. No mention of Jahaerys the concilitator at all. Instead we focus on Aegon, Maegar, the Dance, Aegon the Unworthy and the Mad King. All the very worst Targaryens. And there are lots of good things the Targaryens did! But instead of focusing on that, the show focuses on the war, which means they know that Dany&rsquo;s line about&nbsp;&ldquo;centuries of peace&rdquo; is wrong.</p><p>Bonus, we have more of Viserys arguing for blood purity and that Targaryens are SPECIAL and that they would have been fine if Aegon didn&rsquo;t legitimize so many dirty half breed bastards.</p><p>11. The greatest Targaryen threat, however, is madness (according to Jaime who saw the Mad King first hand). We bring up that line again: &ldquo;Every time a Targaryen is born the gods flip a coin&rdquo;</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;We put up with Aerys hoping Rhaegar would be better but then he also proved mad when he took Lyanna Stark&rdquo;<br /></p></blockquote><p>This does not place Rhaegar as the sane, good sibling most people do. Instead, it also paints him in a negative light. Which, this is Jaime, so take it with a grain of salt. But he actually never hated Rhaegar so yeah&hellip;</p><p>12. Jaime is so bitter about Ned condemning him and it&rsquo;s kinda funny. I love Nikolaj narration</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;I saw what Ned Stark couldn&rsquo;t. Robert was ashamed of the bodies of the children&hellip; and more ashamed at his relief. Glorious heroes didn&rsquo;t kill children. They simply didn&rsquo;t punish their murderers&rdquo; - Jaime being smart with one of my fave lines.</p></blockquote><p>He clearly sees things as they are. He doesn&rsquo;t like the Targaryens but he also doesn&rsquo;t elevate Robert as a god. Jaime doesn&rsquo;t believe in heroes and it shows here.</p><p>13. Then we end with a particularly ominous note.</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;One day I&rsquo;ll return and repay all traitors with the only coin my family knows. Fire and blood&rdquo; - Viserys.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>These are the last words in the video. A threat. It really does not paint the Targaryens as tragic characters pushed out of their rightful throne.</p><p>And this is where I want to talk about the character drawings. Every pose from the original three dragons (Aegon and sisters) is the most villainous thing in the world and the music behind their conquest is intense and dark. Their faces are often lowered but with their eyes glaring up and shrouded in shadow. Their smiles are sharp. Their body language is arrogant. It is victims of the conquest like Lorren and Torrhen who are given more humanized designs.</p><p>On the Targaryen side of things, the most humanized design belongs to Orys Baratheon who has much kinder eyes and a more open expression. And the there&rsquo;s Viserys and Daenerys at the end who look like scared children more than anything. But the Targaryen dynasty that is their birth right doesn&rsquo;t appear to start out on a great foot.</p><p>This kinda all backs up my point that if Daenerys wants to break the wheel, she will have to reject and correct the legacy of her family. The show clearly does not view Aegon as a great hero. So if they mean for Daenerys to be a hero, I hope they have her recognize the history and take steps to correct it (maybe even destroy the iron throne, plz?) And if she doesn&rsquo;t recognize her history or tries to emulate Aegon, she could be headed down a bad path.</p><p>I love the Targaryen family because, like lots of my favorite Westeros families, they are SCREWED UP and have lots of interesting characters, and I look forward to exploring them more in my Fire and Blood post. But if anything, this video just backs up my thesis about unreliable history and what Dany will have to do if she wants to be a good ruler. Break that wheel! It was forged in fire and blood!</p>",

Enjoy SanSan fans.\u00a0</p><!-- more --><p>SanSan - Gangster AU</p><p>Why Don\u2019t You Do Right?</p><p>Sandor stood guard\nover the door to make sure <i>his dame</i> wouldn\u2019t be disturbed\nbefore the show, wearing his zoot suit and hat tipped in such a way\nthat it would cover all the scaring on the right side of his face but\nnot low enough that it would interfere with his vision in any way,\nbefore the stage director came and told him that he only had a few\nminutes before Miss Sansa would be expected to perform. \n</p><p>Sandor nodded and\nknocked his unique knock on the door that relayed that message\nwithout him ever having to say anything and only a minute later Sansa\ncame out, all dolled up and looking particularly beautiful before he\nwalked her to the side wing of the stage before he noticed a bruise\non her back she didn\u2019t quite cover up, it was in a bad spot she\nprobably couldn\u2019t quite reach and she was trying to cover it with\nher fur shall but it wasn\u2019t working, since it only seemed to cover\nhalf of it. \n</p><p>\u201cHang on Little\nBird, you missed a spot.\u201d Sandor noted as he pulled a small box of\nspecial makeup powder and the poof from his pocket just for this\npurpose as she stood still and let him brush and poof on the powder\nto cover the bruise and his jaw clenched and he huffed through his\nnose for the thousandth time. He hated this. He was hired to protect\nher but he was somewhat powerless to protect her from Joffrey, the mob boss who hired him and who had been the only real threat to her\nsafety. \n</p><p>He delicately moved\nthe back of her dress over so that the powder wouldn\u2019t get on it\nand after a moment of trying to cover the bruise and turned the dark\npurple bruise to a barely dark shadow, he realized that that was the\nbest that powder could do and left it alone and moved her dress back.\nSansa, once she realized he was done, said a small but grateful word\nof \u2018thanks\u2019 and kept walking towards the stage where she took a\ndeep breath to calm her nerves. \n</p><p>\u201cI could keep you\nsafe,\u201d Sandor rasped in her ear as they stood in the wing. \u201cThey\u2019re\nall afraid of me. No one would hurt you again, or I\u2019d kill them.\u201d\nSandor offered so softly in her ear behind her that only Sansa would\nhear him. \n</p><p>\u201cNo one can truly protect me, no one can protect anyone, not from him. I know you\ndo all you can but&hellip;\u201d Sansa whispered back over her shoulder as\nshe slid her mask away so to speak to give him a true look that broke\nhis heart more than her bruises did. He was the one person she\nallowed to see her without her \u2018mask\u2019 anymore because he was the\none person who had proved beyond the shadow of a doubt that she was\nsafe to be herself with, a luxury that she had no idea would be as\nprecious as it was. \n</p><p>\u201cHe can\u2019t reach\neverywhere Little Bird, there are cities big enough and depths deep\nenough that I could take you to where no one would find us.\u201d Sandor\npromised. \n</p><p>\u201cWhere would that\nbe?\u201d Sansa asked, her tone disbelieving but almost hopeful. \n</p><p>\u201cChicago or New\nYork for starters, besides it\u2019s only a matter of time before he\ngets what\u2019s coming to him.\u201d Sandor immediately answered, a ghost\nof a grin on his lips. \n</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d Sansa\nsuddenly asked as she caught a glimpse of Joffery with his gang in\nthe audience at the best table. That tramp Margaery on one of his\narms and laughing at nearly everything he said. \n</p><p>\u201cTonight, I\u2019ll\neven pack while you sing.\u201d Sandor offered as his heart almost began\nto soar. \n</p><p>\u201cNo, with you\nbeing gone from your post, they\u2019d know something was up.\u201d Sansa\nreasoned and Sandor knew she was right, that was just wishful\nthinking on his part. \n</p><p>\u201cWe could leave in\nthe middle of the night then, just pack what you absolutely can not\nlive without.\u201d Sandor pleaded. \n</p><p>\u201cWhat about my\npay?\u201d Sansa asked. \n</p><p>\u201cWhat pay? Like I\nsaid, he doesn\u2019t really put it in the bank, he blows it, there is\nnone Little Bird, that\u2019s just how he keeps you here in this god\nforsaken cage.\u201d Sandor insisted and Sansa knew he was probably\ntelling the truth. She hadn\u2019t wanted to believe him the first time he told her that but the more time went on, the more she believed that claim.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat about Arya?\nWhat about Lady?\u201d Sansa asked, knowing Sandor had been keeping Arya safely hidden, disguised as a boy in his apartment nearby. \n</p><p>\u201cThey can come\ntoo, I know Arya wouldn\u2019t leave without Nymeria anyway.\u201d Sandor\npromised. \n</p><p>Then Sansa took a\nmoment to think it over before she gave him the nod and a smirking\nsmile. <i>She was in</i> and Sandor wanted to kiss her and run away\nthat instant but he had to bide his time and Sansa&rsquo;s mask slid back\ninto place and she strutted out to the middle of the stage behind the\ncurtain and became the canary she was. \n</p><p>\u201c<i>You had plenty\nmoney 1922&hellip;</i>\u201d Sansa began to sing sensually as she lifted her\nleg to spread the curtains before they were pulled apart to reveal\nher as the crowd cheered and Sandor watched, still mesmerized by her\nfor a moment before he remembered his job and had to map out the\nplace, realize who was who in the crowd from his vantage point as he\nmoved both of his hands to rest on the handles of his enforcers, just\nin case- as he realized all he really needed was his tommy guns, he\ncould strong arm the rest to take care of her. \n</p><p>Sansa finished her\nset and came out and socialized with the crowd, as was her job,\nbefore she sat with Joffrey and Margaery, putting on a smile and\nacted like nothing was the matter at all and once she was there,\nSandor moved and went to get his tommy guns from the back, where\neveryone kept their guns when not in use, this club was a front for\nJoffrey\u2019s mob after all. \n</p><p>\u201cWhatcha doin?\u201d\nThe lieutenant in charge of the guns asked Sandor curiously as Sandor\narmed himself even more than he already was. \u00a0\n</p><p>\u201cI got a bad\nfeeling, but don\u2019t say nothin to the boss, don\u2019t want to spoil\nhis evening or his mood.\u201d Sandor answered nonchalantly as he loaded\nthem and slung them around his shoulders so that they laid against\nhis sides and put on a trench coat to cover it all before he came\nback out and stood guard over <i>his dame</i> again as he mentally\nfantasized about just opening fire on his boss and all those at the\ntable with them once Sansa would leave the table to go back into her\ncage, but he did not, but the fantasy did put the smallest of smirks\non his lips. \n</p><p>When Sansa was\ndismissed, she quickly packed her suitcase with everything she held\nmost dear and then hid it under her bed, just in case Joffrey came\nback to say good night as she lazily took off all her makeup and did\nher hair up in pin curls and put on her cold creams and such and\nsimply dressed in her night gown and a robe to make it look like she was getting ready for bed just like any other night. Her instincts were\nright, Sandor knocked another special knock on her door to let her\nknow her tormentor was coming and she prepared herself and only a\nmoment later he came into her bedroom/ dressing room/ prison cell. \n</p><p>\u201cYou howled ok\ntonight,\u201d Joffrey noted, in his back handed way of complimenting her. \n</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d she\nthanked him, hoping he wouldn\u2019t get wind of anything. \n</p><p>\u201cSo do you want\nyour pay in cash tonight Doll?\u201d He asked as he tilted his head and\nSansa knew a trick when she saw one as he reached into his pocket and\npulled a thousand dollars in a money clip out of his pocket, a year\u2019s\npay and Sansa felt sick seeing it all. \n</p><p>\u201cNo, put it in the\nbank- as always.\u201d Sansa waived off, knowing if she answered any\ndifferently that he\u2019d flip a switch and was liable to kill her if\nhe suspected she was leaving. Even though a thousand dollars would be\nperfectly handy right about now. \n</p><p>\u201cSmart broad.\u201d\nHe nodded in agreement as he put it away into his pocket again. \u201cMy\nma will be coming to the club tomorrow night, wear this for her.\u201d\nHe commanded as he reached out of the room to grab the gown Sandor\nhad been holding for him and Sansa realized that nothing of the cheap\npaste that was the \u2018jewelry\u2019 that he gave her to wear on stage\nwould really match it. \n</p><p>\u201cI think the\nnecklace your mother had would match it, why don\u2019t you go get it\nout and make sure?\u201d He prodded and Sansa did remarkably well by not\nbatting an eye or reacting in anyway when she realized that that\nnecklace was in her suitcase under the bed and she had to think fast\nof an excuse not to do as she was told. \n</p><p>\u201cThe ruby one?\u201d\nSansa asked before he nodded in agreement but his face clearly showed\nhe was getting impatient with her that she wasn\u2019t obeying him\nimmediately. \n</p><p>\u201cI thought you\ntook that with the sapphire one and the emerald one when you told me\nto keep them at the bank, they were safer in that deposit box than\nwith me.\u201d Sansa answered calmly as a small frown of confusion\ncrossed his face as he tried to recall who he had sold those to, that\nwas several drunken bouts ago and his memory was fuzzy. \n</p><p>\u201cIf someone,\nprobably <i>that hound</i> could go to the bank for me in the morning\nto retrieve it, I\u2019d wear it with this dress.\u201d Sansa affirmed as\nshe made a show of loving this red glittering dress while referencing\nher secret lover with the same impudence Joffrey usually had when he\nbarked orders around to everyone that always seemed to make him grin,\nthinking he had succeeded into taking a beautiful, sweet canary and\nturning it into an ugly vulture. \n</p><p>\u201cYou got it Doll.\u201d\nHe nodded and hung the dress up in her closet with her others before\nhe bid her goodnight and left before he shut and locked her door, giving Sandor back the key.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI could take my\npay though boss,\u201d Sandor offered since he had overheard everything\nfrom the doorway. \n</p><p>Joffrey grumbled\nsomething under his breath as he pulled a hundred out of his pocket\nand handed it over. \u201cWhy are you choppered up?\u201d He asked as\nhe noticed how Sandor was still wearing the tommy guns under his trench coat. \n</p><p>\u201cHad a bad feeling\ntonight Boss, turned out to be nothin but didn\u2019t want to ruin your\nmood by tellin ya and figured it was better to be safe that sorry by\nwearin them to make sure no one tried anything.\u201d Sandor explained. \n</p><p>\u201cSmart thinking,\ngo to the <i>bank</i> tomorrow for her ruby necklace, use em if you\nhave to.\u201d \u00a0He ordered as he nodded to the tommy guns and Sandor\nnodded in understanding before Joffrey finally left, swaggering away\nas Sandor could practically feel Sansa exhale in relief from behind\nthe door. \n</p><p>Sandor waited\nanother full hour before he finally knocked his favorite secret knock\nand smiled when Sansa replied by knocking her own favorite knock back that meant she was ready and wanted him to come in and Sandor unlocked the door slipped into Sansa\u2019s room. \n</p><p>\u201cYou did great\nLittle Bird.\u201d Sandor praised as he kept an ear towards the door as\nhe carefully peeled off his trench coat and tommy guns and hung them on a hook\nbehind the door, Sansa was just about to get changed into other\nclothes before she flung her arms around his neck and shoulders as he\nheld her tight and kissed her the way he had wanted to earlier and was so happy when she kissed back just as passionately.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSoon Little Bird,\nyou\u2019ll be able to fly free.\u201d Sandor whispered between heated\nkisses as he walked her over to her bed as she suddenly jumped up to\nwrap her legs around his waist as his hold moved to under her ass and\nsqueezed it as he suddenly found himself tenting the pants of his\nsuit as he very gently laid her down.</p><p>He was the only man\nto ever physically be gentle and reverent with her. At first he had\nbeen a bit rough in talking with her because he saw how tenderhearted\nshe was and he knew that she needed to toughen up or be swallowed\nalive and once he managed to explain that to her, she seemed to try\nharder and grow thicker skin so to speak. But once Sandor realized he\nwas falling in love with her, he knew he was done for. Because she\nwas still kind and sweet underneath her mask, especially to him,\ndespite everything and Sandor realized how strong she was for staying\nthat way. And Sandor proved to her that she was safe with him. He\nprotected her the best he could, he protected her from everyone,\nexcept Joffrey and even then, he did all he could to try and curb\nJoffrey\u2019s temper when it seemed to get unleashed on her, reminding\nJoffrey that he couldn\u2019t beat her black and blue, not when she was\nexpected to perform and that no makeup in the world could cover up\nthe harm he wanted to cause her and how Joffrey would loose money and\npopularity if he clipped his canary\u2019s wings so short she couldn\u2019t\nsing for him, <i>for anyone</i> and that seemed to be the only thing that\nkept Joffrey at bay, but he still struck her bad enough in a spot she\ncould easily cover up to get out his rage since he was loosing money\nfaster than he was making it, even though he had the city in a\nstrangle hold as it was and was currently bleeding it dry. \u00a0\n</p><p>But during the\nnights like this, Sandor allowed himself to come into her cage with\nher and she would sing for him a song she reserved only for him and\nit was sweeter than any music ever could be. \n</p><p>\u201cHow much longer?\u201d\nSansa asked in a hushed whisper as she took his hat off and set it\ndown on the bedside table before she kissed his scars tenderly, the\nonly woman to ever do so. \n</p><p>\u201cOnly a few hours,\nmake sure everyone is asleep, before the bakers awake though.\u201d\nSandor breathed into her skin as his course hands threatened to snag\nthe delicate satin of her nightgown as he gathered it up to her waist\nas she undid the high waistband\u2019s button and unzipped his zipper of\nhis trousers and un-clipped the suspenders from his waist band to get\nhis pants down before he finally put a rubber on to protect her from\ngetting pregnant and sheathed himself to the hilt in her, drinking\ndown her keening moan in a deep kiss. He did have the largest cock in\nthe whole mob and it was the only one Sansa enjoyed riding and\nenjoyed getting fucked into oblivion with. Of course who it belonged\nto made all the difference too. Sandor actually loved her and never\nhurt her, especially like this or in this way, it had taken Sandor\nover the course of a couple of months of gentle caresses and really\nbeing kind, gentle and patient with her before she enjoyed his touch the way she was\nmeant to before she outright asked for it and physically put his\nhands on her so she would feel loved instead of hated. And finally\nafter their first time together, it was like this sweet innocent who\nonly played a vixen on stage fully came into her own and they fucked\nevery chance they got, but of course it had to be in secret or else\nJoffrey would send them both to swim with the fishes or put them on\nice. \n</p><p>\u201cWell then we\ndefinitely have time for <i>at least</i> one more romp.\u201d Sansa\nbeamed cheekily as she locked her ankles behind the small of his back\nto keep him in place. \n</p><p>\u201cAt least two.\u201d\nSandor rumbled as his hips snapped into hers and he powered a good\nstroke into her, making her eyes fall shut and the most amazing\nkeening moan spill from her throat as her hands went underneath his\njacket to claw at his back over his dress shirt. \n</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t forget to\nsing for me Little Bird.\u201d Sandor grunted into her ear. \n</p><p>\u201cOnly if you\u2019ll\nhowl back Hound.\u201d Sansa purred into his ear before he pulled her\nbreasts from her the top of her night gown to suckle at them and tease her nipples by\nnipping at them, not painfully but enough to really light her on fire\nso to speak as she hissed and gasped in sex hazed delight as his hips\nsped up, trying to get Sansa to her release before he came to his.\nThe one thing he could always give her that didn\u2019t cost him\nanything but time, effort and patience. But those he would always gladly spend on her anyway.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSandor.\u201d Sansa\nwhimpered as her face flashed pain but she wasn\u2019t suffering, far\nfrom it- as she wrapped her arms under his suit jacket and held him\nclose, loving the fiery furnace he always seemed to be, she would\nnever go cold at night ever again. Because after tonight, he wouldn\u2019t\nbe leaving her bed at night. He\u2019d actually be able to sleep with\nher without worry- especially about if whether or not Joffrey and his\nthugs were coming and he\u2019d actually take all of his clothes off for\nonce, instead of only shoving his pants down so he could get\nredressed within a quick second if need be, something that had saved\nthem both on several occasions. \n</p><p>\u201cSansa,\u201d Sandor\nwhispered back, one of the few times he didn\u2019t use his affectionate\nnick name for her before she finally sang as much as she could\nwithout getting anyone\u2019s attention as she found her release, her\nwhole body tensing as her inner walls fluttered and constricted\naround his hardened length, even through the thick rubber condom that\nhe could feel her as he finally slammed into her, grinding out his\nown release as he grunted and growled into her own ear as he nipped\nat her ear lobe playfully as she finally laxed as they both breathed\nheavily as they basked in the afterglow and recovered. \n</p><p>Sandor and Sansa\nmade love one more time as they waited until a quarter to three in\nthe morning, to make sure everyone was asleep before they slipped\naway into the night and drove to New York, Lady in Sansa\u2019s lap in\nthe front seat and Arya stretched out in the backseat, Nymeria in her\nlap as she was wearing her own zoot suit with matching hat and had\nher own tommy gun next to her, ready to shoot whoever would be\nfollowing them. Sandor held onto Sansa\u2019s hand, kissing it softly\nand reverently from time to time as he drove them to the safety of\nthe biggest apple of all as all three of them, Sansa especially,\nfinally smiling genuinely for once. \n</p>",

Enjoy SanSan fans.\u00a0</p>[[MORE]]<p>SanSan - Gangster AU</p><p>Why Don\u2019t You Do Right?</p><p>Sandor stood guard\nover the door to make sure <i>his dame</i> wouldn\u2019t be disturbed\nbefore the show, wearing his zoot suit and hat tipped in such a way\nthat it would cover all the scaring on the right side of his face but\nnot low enough that it would interfere with his vision in any way,\nbefore the stage director came and told him that he only had a few\nminutes before Miss Sansa would be expected to perform. \n</p><p>Sandor nodded and\nknocked his unique knock on the door that relayed that message\nwithout him ever having to say anything and only a minute later Sansa\ncame out, all dolled up and looking particularly beautiful before he\nwalked her to the side wing of the stage before he noticed a bruise\non her back she didn\u2019t quite cover up, it was in a bad spot she\nprobably couldn\u2019t quite reach and she was trying to cover it with\nher fur shall but it wasn\u2019t working, since it only seemed to cover\nhalf of it. \n</p><p>\u201cHang on Little\nBird, you missed a spot.\u201d Sandor noted as he pulled a small box of\nspecial makeup powder and the poof from his pocket just for this\npurpose as she stood still and let him brush and poof on the powder\nto cover the bruise and his jaw clenched and he huffed through his\nnose for the thousandth time. He hated this. He was hired to protect\nher but he was somewhat powerless to protect her from Joffrey, the mob boss who hired him and who had been the only real threat to her\nsafety. \n</p><p>He delicately moved\nthe back of her dress over so that the powder wouldn\u2019t get on it\nand after a moment of trying to cover the bruise and turned the dark\npurple bruise to a barely dark shadow, he realized that that was the\nbest that powder could do and left it alone and moved her dress back.\nSansa, once she realized he was done, said a small but grateful word\nof \u2018thanks\u2019 and kept walking towards the stage where she took a\ndeep breath to calm her nerves. \n</p><p>\u201cI could keep you\nsafe,\u201d Sandor rasped in her ear as they stood in the wing. \u201cThey\u2019re\nall afraid of me. No one would hurt you again, or I\u2019d kill them.\u201d\nSandor offered so softly in her ear behind her that only Sansa would\nhear him. \n</p><p>\u201cNo one can truly protect me, no one can protect anyone, not from him. I know you\ndo all you can but\u2026\u201d Sansa whispered back over her shoulder as\nshe slid her mask away so to speak to give him a true look that broke\nhis heart more than her bruises did. He was the one person she\nallowed to see her without her \u2018mask\u2019 anymore because he was the\none person who had proved beyond the shadow of a doubt that she was\nsafe to be herself with, a luxury that she had no idea would be as\nprecious as it was. \n</p><p>\u201cHe can\u2019t reach\neverywhere Little Bird, there are cities big enough and depths deep\nenough that I could take you to where no one would find us.\u201d Sandor\npromised. \n</p><p>\u201cWhere would that\nbe?\u201d Sansa asked, her tone disbelieving but almost hopeful. \n</p><p>\u201cChicago or New\nYork for starters, besides it\u2019s only a matter of time before he\ngets what\u2019s coming to him.\u201d Sandor immediately answered, a ghost\nof a grin on his lips. \n</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d Sansa\nsuddenly asked as she caught a glimpse of Joffery with his gang in\nthe audience at the best table. That tramp Margaery on one of his\narms and laughing at nearly everything he said. \n</p><p>\u201cTonight, I\u2019ll\neven pack while you sing.\u201d Sandor offered as his heart almost began\nto soar. \n</p><p>\u201cNo, with you\nbeing gone from your post, they\u2019d know something was up.\u201d Sansa\nreasoned and Sandor knew she was right, that was just wishful\nthinking on his part. \n</p><p>\u201cWe could leave in\nthe middle of the night then, just pack what you absolutely can not\nlive without.\u201d Sandor pleaded. \n</p><p>\u201cWhat about my\npay?\u201d Sansa asked. \n</p><p>\u201cWhat pay? Like I\nsaid, he doesn\u2019t really put it in the bank, he blows it, there is\nnone Little Bird, that\u2019s just how he keeps you here in this god\nforsaken cage.\u201d Sandor insisted and Sansa knew he was probably\ntelling the truth. She hadn\u2019t wanted to believe him the first time he told her that but the more time went on, the more she believed that claim.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat about Arya?\nWhat about Lady?\u201d Sansa asked, knowing Sandor had been keeping Arya safely hidden, disguised as a boy in his apartment nearby. \n</p><p>\u201cThey can come\ntoo, I know Arya wouldn\u2019t leave without Nymeria anyway.\u201d Sandor\npromised. \n</p><p>Then Sansa took a\nmoment to think it over before she gave him the nod and a smirking\nsmile. <i>She was in</i> and Sandor wanted to kiss her and run away\nthat instant but he had to bide his time and Sansa\u2019s mask slid back\ninto place and she strutted out to the middle of the stage behind the\ncurtain and became the canary she was. \n</p><p>\u201c<i>You had plenty\nmoney 1922\u2026</i>\u201d Sansa began to sing sensually as she lifted her\nleg to spread the curtains before they were pulled apart to reveal\nher as the crowd cheered and Sandor watched, still mesmerized by her\nfor a moment before he remembered his job and had to map out the\nplace, realize who was who in the crowd from his vantage point as he\nmoved both of his hands to rest on the handles of his enforcers, just\nin case- as he realized all he really needed was his tommy guns, he\ncould strong arm the rest to take care of her. \n</p><p>Sansa finished her\nset and came out and socialized with the crowd, as was her job,\nbefore she sat with Joffrey and Margaery, putting on a smile and\nacted like nothing was the matter at all and once she was there,\nSandor moved and went to get his tommy guns from the back, where\neveryone kept their guns when not in use, this club was a front for\nJoffrey\u2019s mob after all. \n</p><p>\u201cWhatcha doin?\u201d\nThe lieutenant in charge of the guns asked Sandor curiously as Sandor\narmed himself even more than he already was. \u00a0\n</p><p>\u201cI got a bad\nfeeling, but don\u2019t say nothin to the boss, don\u2019t want to spoil\nhis evening or his mood.\u201d Sandor answered nonchalantly as he loaded\nthem and slung them around his shoulders so that they laid against\nhis sides and put on a trench coat to cover it all before he came\nback out and stood guard over <i>his dame</i> again as he mentally\nfantasized about just opening fire on his boss and all those at the\ntable with them once Sansa would leave the table to go back into her\ncage, but he did not, but the fantasy did put the smallest of smirks\non his lips. \n</p><p>When Sansa was\ndismissed, she quickly packed her suitcase with everything she held\nmost dear and then hid it under her bed, just in case Joffrey came\nback to say good night as she lazily took off all her makeup and did\nher hair up in pin curls and put on her cold creams and such and\nsimply dressed in her night gown and a robe to make it look like she was getting ready for bed just like any other night. Her instincts were\nright, Sandor knocked another special knock on her door to let her\nknow her tormentor was coming and she prepared herself and only a\nmoment later he came into her bedroom/ dressing room/ prison cell. \n</p><p>\u201cYou howled ok\ntonight,\u201d Joffrey noted, in his back handed way of complimenting her. \n</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d she\nthanked him, hoping he wouldn\u2019t get wind of anything. \n</p><p>\u201cSo do you want\nyour pay in cash tonight Doll?\u201d He asked as he tilted his head and\nSansa knew a trick when she saw one as he reached into his pocket and\npulled a thousand dollars in a money clip out of his pocket, a year\u2019s\npay and Sansa felt sick seeing it all. \n</p><p>\u201cNo, put it in the\nbank- as always.\u201d Sansa waived off, knowing if she answered any\ndifferently that he\u2019d flip a switch and was liable to kill her if\nhe suspected she was leaving. Even though a thousand dollars would be\nperfectly handy right about now. \n</p><p>\u201cSmart broad.\u201d\nHe nodded in agreement as he put it away into his pocket again. \u201cMy\nma will be coming to the club tomorrow night, wear this for her.\u201d\nHe commanded as he reached out of the room to grab the gown Sandor\nhad been holding for him and Sansa realized that nothing of the cheap\npaste that was the \u2018jewelry\u2019 that he gave her to wear on stage\nwould really match it. \n</p><p>\u201cI think the\nnecklace your mother had would match it, why don\u2019t you go get it\nout and make sure?\u201d He prodded and Sansa did remarkably well by not\nbatting an eye or reacting in anyway when she realized that that\nnecklace was in her suitcase under the bed and she had to think fast\nof an excuse not to do as she was told. \n</p><p>\u201cThe ruby one?\u201d\nSansa asked before he nodded in agreement but his face clearly showed\nhe was getting impatient with her that she wasn\u2019t obeying him\nimmediately. \n</p><p>\u201cI thought you\ntook that with the sapphire one and the emerald one when you told me\nto keep them at the bank, they were safer in that deposit box than\nwith me.\u201d Sansa answered calmly as a small frown of confusion\ncrossed his face as he tried to recall who he had sold those to, that\nwas several drunken bouts ago and his memory was fuzzy. \n</p><p>\u201cIf someone,\nprobably <i>that hound</i> could go to the bank for me in the morning\nto retrieve it, I\u2019d wear it with this dress.\u201d Sansa affirmed as\nshe made a show of loving this red glittering dress while referencing\nher secret lover with the same impudence Joffrey usually had when he\nbarked orders around to everyone that always seemed to make him grin,\nthinking he had succeeded into taking a beautiful, sweet canary and\nturning it into an ugly vulture. \n</p><p>\u201cYou got it Doll.\u201d\nHe nodded and hung the dress up in her closet with her others before\nhe bid her goodnight and left before he shut and locked her door, giving Sandor back the key.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI could take my\npay though boss,\u201d Sandor offered since he had overheard everything\nfrom the doorway. \n</p><p>Joffrey grumbled\nsomething under his breath as he pulled a hundred out of his pocket\nand handed it over. \u201cWhy are you choppered up?\u201d He asked as\nhe noticed how Sandor was still wearing the tommy guns under his trench coat. \n</p><p>\u201cHad a bad feeling\ntonight Boss, turned out to be nothin but didn\u2019t want to ruin your\nmood by tellin ya and figured it was better to be safe that sorry by\nwearin them to make sure no one tried anything.\u201d Sandor explained. \n</p><p>\u201cSmart thinking,\ngo to the <i>bank</i> tomorrow for her ruby necklace, use em if you\nhave to.\u201d \u00a0He ordered as he nodded to the tommy guns and Sandor\nnodded in understanding before Joffrey finally left, swaggering away\nas Sandor could practically feel Sansa exhale in relief from behind\nthe door. \n</p><p>Sandor waited\nanother full hour before he finally knocked his favorite secret knock\nand smiled when Sansa replied by knocking her own favorite knock back that meant she was ready and wanted him to come in and Sandor unlocked the door slipped into Sansa\u2019s room. \n</p><p>\u201cYou did great\nLittle Bird.\u201d Sandor praised as he kept an ear towards the door as\nhe carefully peeled off his trench coat and tommy guns and hung them on a hook\nbehind the door, Sansa was just about to get changed into other\nclothes before she flung her arms around his neck and shoulders as he\nheld her tight and kissed her the way he had wanted to earlier and was so happy when she kissed back just as passionately.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSoon Little Bird,\nyou\u2019ll be able to fly free.\u201d Sandor whispered between heated\nkisses as he walked her over to her bed as she suddenly jumped up to\nwrap her legs around his waist as his hold moved to under her ass and\nsqueezed it as he suddenly found himself tenting the pants of his\nsuit as he very gently laid her down.</p><p>He was the only man\nto ever physically be gentle and reverent with her. At first he had\nbeen a bit rough in talking with her because he saw how tenderhearted\nshe was and he knew that she needed to toughen up or be swallowed\nalive and once he managed to explain that to her, she seemed to try\nharder and grow thicker skin so to speak. But once Sandor realized he\nwas falling in love with her, he knew he was done for. Because she\nwas still kind and sweet underneath her mask, especially to him,\ndespite everything and Sandor realized how strong she was for staying\nthat way. And Sandor proved to her that she was safe with him. He\nprotected her the best he could, he protected her from everyone,\nexcept Joffrey and even then, he did all he could to try and curb\nJoffrey\u2019s temper when it seemed to get unleashed on her, reminding\nJoffrey that he couldn\u2019t beat her black and blue, not when she was\nexpected to perform and that no makeup in the world could cover up\nthe harm he wanted to cause her and how Joffrey would loose money and\npopularity if he clipped his canary\u2019s wings so short she couldn\u2019t\nsing for him, <i>for anyone</i> and that seemed to be the only thing that\nkept Joffrey at bay, but he still struck her bad enough in a spot she\ncould easily cover up to get out his rage since he was loosing money\nfaster than he was making it, even though he had the city in a\nstrangle hold as it was and was currently bleeding it dry. \u00a0\n</p><p>But during the\nnights like this, Sandor allowed himself to come into her cage with\nher and she would sing for him a song she reserved only for him and\nit was sweeter than any music ever could be. \n</p><p>\u201cHow much longer?\u201d\nSansa asked in a hushed whisper as she took his hat off and set it\ndown on the bedside table before she kissed his scars tenderly, the\nonly woman to ever do so. \n</p><p>\u201cOnly a few hours,\nmake sure everyone is asleep, before the bakers awake though.\u201d\nSandor breathed into her skin as his course hands threatened to snag\nthe delicate satin of her nightgown as he gathered it up to her waist\nas she undid the high waistband\u2019s button and unzipped his zipper of\nhis trousers and un-clipped the suspenders from his waist band to get\nhis pants down before he finally put a rubber on to protect her from\ngetting pregnant and sheathed himself to the hilt in her, drinking\ndown her keening moan in a deep kiss. He did have the largest cock in\nthe whole mob and it was the only one Sansa enjoyed riding and\nenjoyed getting fucked into oblivion with. Of course who it belonged\nto made all the difference too. Sandor actually loved her and never\nhurt her, especially like this or in this way, it had taken Sandor\nover the course of a couple of months of gentle caresses and really\nbeing kind, gentle and patient with her before she enjoyed his touch the way she was\nmeant to before she outright asked for it and physically put his\nhands on her so she would feel loved instead of hated. And finally\nafter their first time together, it was like this sweet innocent who\nonly played a vixen on stage fully came into her own and they fucked\nevery chance they got, but of course it had to be in secret or else\nJoffrey would send them both to swim with the fishes or put them on\nice. \n</p><p>\u201cWell then we\ndefinitely have time for <i>at least</i> one more romp.\u201d Sansa\nbeamed cheekily as she locked her ankles behind the small of his back\nto keep him in place. \n</p><p>\u201cAt least two.\u201d\nSandor rumbled as his hips snapped into hers and he powered a good\nstroke into her, making her eyes fall shut and the most amazing\nkeening moan spill from her throat as her hands went underneath his\njacket to claw at his back over his dress shirt. \n</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t forget to\nsing for me Little Bird.\u201d Sandor grunted into her ear. \n</p><p>\u201cOnly if you\u2019ll\nhowl back Hound.\u201d Sansa purred into his ear before he pulled her\nbreasts from her the top of her night gown to suckle at them and tease her nipples by\nnipping at them, not painfully but enough to really light her on fire\nso to speak as she hissed and gasped in sex hazed delight as his hips\nsped up, trying to get Sansa to her release before he came to his.\nThe one thing he could always give her that didn\u2019t cost him\nanything but time, effort and patience. But those he would always gladly spend on her anyway.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSandor.\u201d Sansa\nwhimpered as her face flashed pain but she wasn\u2019t suffering, far\nfrom it- as she wrapped her arms under his suit jacket and held him\nclose, loving the fiery furnace he always seemed to be, she would\nnever go cold at night ever again. Because after tonight, he wouldn\u2019t\nbe leaving her bed at night. He\u2019d actually be able to sleep with\nher without worry- especially about if whether or not Joffrey and his\nthugs were coming and he\u2019d actually take all of his clothes off for\nonce, instead of only shoving his pants down so he could get\nredressed within a quick second if need be, something that had saved\nthem both on several occasions. \n</p><p>\u201cSansa,\u201d Sandor\nwhispered back, one of the few times he didn\u2019t use his affectionate\nnick name for her before she finally sang as much as she could\nwithout getting anyone\u2019s attention as she found her release, her\nwhole body tensing as her inner walls fluttered and constricted\naround his hardened length, even through the thick rubber condom that\nhe could feel her as he finally slammed into her, grinding out his\nown release as he grunted and growled into her own ear as he nipped\nat her ear lobe playfully as she finally laxed as they both breathed\nheavily as they basked in the afterglow and recovered. \n</p><p>Sandor and Sansa\nmade love one more time as they waited until a quarter to three in\nthe morning, to make sure everyone was asleep before they slipped\naway into the night and drove to New York, Lady in Sansa\u2019s lap in\nthe front seat and Arya stretched out in the backseat, Nymeria in her\nlap as she was wearing her own zoot suit with matching hat and had\nher own tommy gun next to her, ready to shoot whoever would be\nfollowing them. Sandor held onto Sansa\u2019s hand, kissing it softly\nand reverently from time to time as he drove them to the safety of\nthe biggest apple of all as all three of them, Sansa especially,\nfinally smiling genuinely for once. \n</p></p>",

Enjoy SanSan fans.\u00a0</p>[[MORE]]<p>SanSan - Gangster AU</p><p>Why Don\u2019t You Do Right?</p><p>Sandor stood guard\nover the door to make sure <i>his dame</i> wouldn\u2019t be disturbed\nbefore the show, wearing his zoot suit and hat tipped in such a way\nthat it would cover all the scaring on the right side of his face but\nnot low enough that it would interfere with his vision in any way,\nbefore the stage director came and told him that he only had a few\nminutes before Miss Sansa would be expected to perform. \n</p><p>Sandor nodded and\nknocked his unique knock on the door that relayed that message\nwithout him ever having to say anything and only a minute later Sansa\ncame out, all dolled up and looking particularly beautiful before he\nwalked her to the side wing of the stage before he noticed a bruise\non her back she didn\u2019t quite cover up, it was in a bad spot she\nprobably couldn\u2019t quite reach and she was trying to cover it with\nher fur shall but it wasn\u2019t working, since it only seemed to cover\nhalf of it. \n</p><p>\u201cHang on Little\nBird, you missed a spot.\u201d Sandor noted as he pulled a small box of\nspecial makeup powder and the poof from his pocket just for this\npurpose as she stood still and let him brush and poof on the powder\nto cover the bruise and his jaw clenched and he huffed through his\nnose for the thousandth time. He hated this. He was hired to protect\nher but he was somewhat powerless to protect her from Joffrey, the mob boss who hired him and who had been the only real threat to her\nsafety. \n</p><p>He delicately moved\nthe back of her dress over so that the powder wouldn\u2019t get on it\nand after a moment of trying to cover the bruise and turned the dark\npurple bruise to a barely dark shadow, he realized that that was the\nbest that powder could do and left it alone and moved her dress back.\nSansa, once she realized he was done, said a small but grateful word\nof \u2018thanks\u2019 and kept walking towards the stage where she took a\ndeep breath to calm her nerves. \n</p><p>\u201cI could keep you\nsafe,\u201d Sandor rasped in her ear as they stood in the wing. \u201cThey\u2019re\nall afraid of me. No one would hurt you again, or I\u2019d kill them.\u201d\nSandor offered so softly in her ear behind her that only Sansa would\nhear him. \n</p><p>\u201cNo one can truly protect me, no one can protect anyone, not from him. I know you\ndo all you can but\u2026\u201d Sansa whispered back over her shoulder as\nshe slid her mask away so to speak to give him a true look that broke\nhis heart more than her bruises did. He was the one person she\nallowed to see her without her \u2018mask\u2019 anymore because he was the\none person who had proved beyond the shadow of a doubt that she was\nsafe to be herself with, a luxury that she had no idea would be as\nprecious as it was. \n</p><p>\u201cHe can\u2019t reach\neverywhere Little Bird, there are cities big enough and depths deep\nenough that I could take you to where no one would find us.\u201d Sandor\npromised. \n</p><p>\u201cWhere would that\nbe?\u201d Sansa asked, her tone disbelieving but almost hopeful. \n</p><p>\u201cChicago or New\nYork for starters, besides it\u2019s only a matter of time before he\ngets what\u2019s coming to him.\u201d Sandor immediately answered, a ghost\nof a grin on his lips. \n</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d Sansa\nsuddenly asked as she caught a glimpse of Joffery with his gang in\nthe audience at the best table. That tramp Margaery on one of his\narms and laughing at nearly everything he said. \n</p><p>\u201cTonight, I\u2019ll\neven pack while you sing.\u201d Sandor offered as his heart almost began\nto soar. \n</p><p>\u201cNo, with you\nbeing gone from your post, they\u2019d know something was up.\u201d Sansa\nreasoned and Sandor knew she was right, that was just wishful\nthinking on his part. \n</p><p>\u201cWe could leave in\nthe middle of the night then, just pack what you absolutely can not\nlive without.\u201d Sandor pleaded. \n</p><p>\u201cWhat about my\npay?\u201d Sansa asked. \n</p><p>\u201cWhat pay? Like I\nsaid, he doesn\u2019t really put it in the bank, he blows it, there is\nnone Little Bird, that\u2019s just how he keeps you here in this god\nforsaken cage.\u201d Sandor insisted and Sansa knew he was probably\ntelling the truth. She hadn\u2019t wanted to believe him the first time he told her that but the more time went on, the more she believed that claim.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat about Arya?\nWhat about Lady?\u201d Sansa asked, knowing Sandor had been keeping Arya safely hidden, disguised as a boy in his apartment nearby. \n</p><p>\u201cThey can come\ntoo, I know Arya wouldn\u2019t leave without Nymeria anyway.\u201d Sandor\npromised. \n</p><p>Then Sansa took a\nmoment to think it over before she gave him the nod and a smirking\nsmile. <i>She was in</i> and Sandor wanted to kiss her and run away\nthat instant but he had to bide his time and Sansa\u2019s mask slid back\ninto place and she strutted out to the middle of the stage behind the\ncurtain and became the canary she was. \n</p><p>\u201c<i>You had plenty\nmoney 1922\u2026</i>\u201d Sansa began to sing sensually as she lifted her\nleg to spread the curtains before they were pulled apart to reveal\nher as the crowd cheered and Sandor watched, still mesmerized by her\nfor a moment before he remembered his job and had to map out the\nplace, realize who was who in the crowd from his vantage point as he\nmoved both of his hands to rest on the handles of his enforcers, just\nin case- as he realized all he really needed was his tommy guns, he\ncould strong arm the rest to take care of her. \n</p><p>Sansa finished her\nset and came out and socialized with the crowd, as was her job,\nbefore she sat with Joffrey and Margaery, putting on a smile and\nacted like nothing was the matter at all and once she was there,\nSandor moved and went to get his tommy guns from the back, where\neveryone kept their guns when not in use, this club was a front for\nJoffrey\u2019s mob after all. \n</p><p>\u201cWhatcha doin?\u201d\nThe lieutenant in charge of the guns asked Sandor curiously as Sandor\narmed himself even more than he already was. \u00a0\n</p><p>\u201cI got a bad\nfeeling, but don\u2019t say nothin to the boss, don\u2019t want to spoil\nhis evening or his mood.\u201d Sandor answered nonchalantly as he loaded\nthem and slung them around his shoulders so that they laid against\nhis sides and put on a trench coat to cover it all before he came\nback out and stood guard over <i>his dame</i> again as he mentally\nfantasized about just opening fire on his boss and all those at the\ntable with them once Sansa would leave the table to go back into her\ncage, but he did not, but the fantasy did put the smallest of smirks\non his lips. \n</p><p>When Sansa was\ndismissed, she quickly packed her suitcase with everything she held\nmost dear and then hid it under her bed, just in case Joffrey came\nback to say good night as she lazily took off all her makeup and did\nher hair up in pin curls and put on her cold creams and such and\nsimply dressed in her night gown and a robe to make it look like she was getting ready for bed just like any other night. Her instincts were\nright, Sandor knocked another special knock on her door to let her\nknow her tormentor was coming and she prepared herself and only a\nmoment later he came into her bedroom/ dressing room/ prison cell. \n</p><p>\u201cYou howled ok\ntonight,\u201d Joffrey noted, in his back handed way of complimenting her. \n</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d she\nthanked him, hoping he wouldn\u2019t get wind of anything. \n</p><p>\u201cSo do you want\nyour pay in cash tonight Doll?\u201d He asked as he tilted his head and\nSansa knew a trick when she saw one as he reached into his pocket and\npulled a thousand dollars in a money clip out of his pocket, a year\u2019s\npay and Sansa felt sick seeing it all. \n</p><p>\u201cNo, put it in the\nbank- as always.\u201d Sansa waived off, knowing if she answered any\ndifferently that he\u2019d flip a switch and was liable to kill her if\nhe suspected she was leaving. Even though a thousand dollars would be\nperfectly handy right about now. \n</p><p>\u201cSmart broad.\u201d\nHe nodded in agreement as he put it away into his pocket again. \u201cMy\nma will be coming to the club tomorrow night, wear this for her.\u201d\nHe commanded as he reached out of the room to grab the gown Sandor\nhad been holding for him and Sansa realized that nothing of the cheap\npaste that was the \u2018jewelry\u2019 that he gave her to wear on stage\nwould really match it. \n</p><p>\u201cI think the\nnecklace your mother had would match it, why don\u2019t you go get it\nout and make sure?\u201d He prodded and Sansa did remarkably well by not\nbatting an eye or reacting in anyway when she realized that that\nnecklace was in her suitcase under the bed and she had to think fast\nof an excuse not to do as she was told. \n</p><p>\u201cThe ruby one?\u201d\nSansa asked before he nodded in agreement but his face clearly showed\nhe was getting impatient with her that she wasn\u2019t obeying him\nimmediately. \n</p><p>\u201cI thought you\ntook that with the sapphire one and the emerald one when you told me\nto keep them at the bank, they were safer in that deposit box than\nwith me.\u201d Sansa answered calmly as a small frown of confusion\ncrossed his face as he tried to recall who he had sold those to, that\nwas several drunken bouts ago and his memory was fuzzy. \n</p><p>\u201cIf someone,\nprobably <i>that hound</i> could go to the bank for me in the morning\nto retrieve it, I\u2019d wear it with this dress.\u201d Sansa affirmed as\nshe made a show of loving this red glittering dress while referencing\nher secret lover with the same impudence Joffrey usually had when he\nbarked orders around to everyone that always seemed to make him grin,\nthinking he had succeeded into taking a beautiful, sweet canary and\nturning it into an ugly vulture. \n</p><p>\u201cYou got it Doll.\u201d\nHe nodded and hung the dress up in her closet with her others before\nhe bid her goodnight and left before he shut and locked her door, giving Sandor back the key.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI could take my\npay though boss,\u201d Sandor offered since he had overheard everything\nfrom the doorway. \n</p><p>Joffrey grumbled\nsomething under his breath as he pulled a hundred out of his pocket\nand handed it over. \u201cWhy are you choppered up?\u201d He asked as\nhe noticed how Sandor was still wearing the tommy guns under his trench coat. \n</p><p>\u201cHad a bad feeling\ntonight Boss, turned out to be nothin but didn\u2019t want to ruin your\nmood by tellin ya and figured it was better to be safe that sorry by\nwearin them to make sure no one tried anything.\u201d Sandor explained. \n</p><p>\u201cSmart thinking,\ngo to the <i>bank</i> tomorrow for her ruby necklace, use em if you\nhave to.\u201d \u00a0He ordered as he nodded to the tommy guns and Sandor\nnodded in understanding before Joffrey finally left, swaggering away\nas Sandor could practically feel Sansa exhale in relief from behind\nthe door. \n</p><p>Sandor waited\nanother full hour before he finally knocked his favorite secret knock\nand smiled when Sansa replied by knocking her own favorite knock back that meant she was ready and wanted him to come in and Sandor unlocked the door slipped into Sansa\u2019s room. \n</p><p>\u201cYou did great\nLittle Bird.\u201d Sandor praised as he kept an ear towards the door as\nhe carefully peeled off his trench coat and tommy guns and hung them on a hook\nbehind the door, Sansa was just about to get changed into other\nclothes before she flung her arms around his neck and shoulders as he\nheld her tight and kissed her the way he had wanted to earlier and was so happy when she kissed back just as passionately.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSoon Little Bird,\nyou\u2019ll be able to fly free.\u201d Sandor whispered between heated\nkisses as he walked her over to her bed as she suddenly jumped up to\nwrap her legs around his waist as his hold moved to under her ass and\nsqueezed it as he suddenly found himself tenting the pants of his\nsuit as he very gently laid her down.</p><p>He was the only man\nto ever physically be gentle and reverent with her. At first he had\nbeen a bit rough in talking with her because he saw how tenderhearted\nshe was and he knew that she needed to toughen up or be swallowed\nalive and once he managed to explain that to her, she seemed to try\nharder and grow thicker skin so to speak. But once Sandor realized he\nwas falling in love with her, he knew he was done for. Because she\nwas still kind and sweet underneath her mask, especially to him,\ndespite everything and Sandor realized how strong she was for staying\nthat way. And Sandor proved to her that she was safe with him. He\nprotected her the best he could, he protected her from everyone,\nexcept Joffrey and even then, he did all he could to try and curb\nJoffrey\u2019s temper when it seemed to get unleashed on her, reminding\nJoffrey that he couldn\u2019t beat her black and blue, not when she was\nexpected to perform and that no makeup in the world could cover up\nthe harm he wanted to cause her and how Joffrey would loose money and\npopularity if he clipped his canary\u2019s wings so short she couldn\u2019t\nsing for him, <i>for anyone</i> and that seemed to be the only thing that\nkept Joffrey at bay, but he still struck her bad enough in a spot she\ncould easily cover up to get out his rage since he was loosing money\nfaster than he was making it, even though he had the city in a\nstrangle hold as it was and was currently bleeding it dry. \u00a0\n</p><p>But during the\nnights like this, Sandor allowed himself to come into her cage with\nher and she would sing for him a song she reserved only for him and\nit was sweeter than any music ever could be. \n</p><p>\u201cHow much longer?\u201d\nSansa asked in a hushed whisper as she took his hat off and set it\ndown on the bedside table before she kissed his scars tenderly, the\nonly woman to ever do so. \n</p><p>\u201cOnly a few hours,\nmake sure everyone is asleep, before the bakers awake though.\u201d\nSandor breathed into her skin as his course hands threatened to snag\nthe delicate satin of her nightgown as he gathered it up to her waist\nas she undid the high waistband\u2019s button and unzipped his zipper of\nhis trousers and un-clipped the suspenders from his waist band to get\nhis pants down before he finally put a rubber on to protect her from\ngetting pregnant and sheathed himself to the hilt in her, drinking\ndown her keening moan in a deep kiss. He did have the largest cock in\nthe whole mob and it was the only one Sansa enjoyed riding and\nenjoyed getting fucked into oblivion with. Of course who it belonged\nto made all the difference too. Sandor actually loved her and never\nhurt her, especially like this or in this way, it had taken Sandor\nover the course of a couple of months of gentle caresses and really\nbeing kind, gentle and patient with her before she enjoyed his touch the way she was\nmeant to before she outright asked for it and physically put his\nhands on her so she would feel loved instead of hated. And finally\nafter their first time together, it was like this sweet innocent who\nonly played a vixen on stage fully came into her own and they fucked\nevery chance they got, but of course it had to be in secret or else\nJoffrey would send them both to swim with the fishes or put them on\nice. \n</p><p>\u201cWell then we\ndefinitely have time for <i>at least</i> one more romp.\u201d Sansa\nbeamed cheekily as she locked her ankles behind the small of his back\nto keep him in place. \n</p><p>\u201cAt least two.\u201d\nSandor rumbled as his hips snapped into hers and he powered a good\nstroke into her, making her eyes fall shut and the most amazing\nkeening moan spill from her throat as her hands went underneath his\njacket to claw at his back over his dress shirt. \n</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t forget to\nsing for me Little Bird.\u201d Sandor grunted into her ear. \n</p><p>\u201cOnly if you\u2019ll\nhowl back Hound.\u201d Sansa purred into his ear before he pulled her\nbreasts from her the top of her night gown to suckle at them and tease her nipples by\nnipping at them, not painfully but enough to really light her on fire\nso to speak as she hissed and gasped in sex hazed delight as his hips\nsped up, trying to get Sansa to her release before he came to his.\nThe one thing he could always give her that didn\u2019t cost him\nanything but time, effort and patience. But those he would always gladly spend on her anyway.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSandor.\u201d Sansa\nwhimpered as her face flashed pain but she wasn\u2019t suffering, far\nfrom it- as she wrapped her arms under his suit jacket and held him\nclose, loving the fiery furnace he always seemed to be, she would\nnever go cold at night ever again. Because after tonight, he wouldn\u2019t\nbe leaving her bed at night. He\u2019d actually be able to sleep with\nher without worry- especially about if whether or not Joffrey and his\nthugs were coming and he\u2019d actually take all of his clothes off for\nonce, instead of only shoving his pants down so he could get\nredressed within a quick second if need be, something that had saved\nthem both on several occasions. \n</p><p>\u201cSansa,\u201d Sandor\nwhispered back, one of the few times he didn\u2019t use his affectionate\nnick name for her before she finally sang as much as she could\nwithout getting anyone\u2019s attention as she found her release, her\nwhole body tensing as her inner walls fluttered and constricted\naround his hardened length, even through the thick rubber condom that\nhe could feel her as he finally slammed into her, grinding out his\nown release as he grunted and growled into her own ear as he nipped\nat her ear lobe playfully as she finally laxed as they both breathed\nheavily as they basked in the afterglow and recovered. \n</p><p>Sandor and Sansa\nmade love one more time as they waited until a quarter to three in\nthe morning, to make sure everyone was asleep before they slipped\naway into the night and drove to New York, Lady in Sansa\u2019s lap in\nthe front seat and Arya stretched out in the backseat, Nymeria in her\nlap as she was wearing her own zoot suit with matching hat and had\nher own tommy gun next to her, ready to shoot whoever would be\nfollowing them. Sandor held onto Sansa\u2019s hand, kissing it softly\nand reverently from time to time as he drove them to the safety of\nthe biggest apple of all as all three of them, Sansa especially,\nfinally smiling genuinely for once. \n</p></p>",

Enjoy SanSan fans.&nbsp;</p><p>SanSan - Gangster AU</p><p>Why Don&rsquo;t You Do Right?</p><p>Sandor stood guard\nover the door to make sure <i>his dame</i> wouldn&rsquo;t be disturbed\nbefore the show, wearing his zoot suit and hat tipped in such a way\nthat it would cover all the scaring on the right side of his face but\nnot low enough that it would interfere with his vision in any way,\nbefore the stage director came and told him that he only had a few\nminutes before Miss Sansa would be expected to perform. \n</p><p>Sandor nodded and\nknocked his unique knock on the door that relayed that message\nwithout him ever having to say anything and only a minute later Sansa\ncame out, all dolled up and looking particularly beautiful before he\nwalked her to the side wing of the stage before he noticed a bruise\non her back she didn&rsquo;t quite cover up, it was in a bad spot she\nprobably couldn&rsquo;t quite reach and she was trying to cover it with\nher fur shall but it wasn&rsquo;t working, since it only seemed to cover\nhalf of it. \n</p><p>&ldquo;Hang on Little\nBird, you missed a spot.&rdquo; Sandor noted as he pulled a small box of\nspecial makeup powder and the poof from his pocket just for this\npurpose as she stood still and let him brush and poof on the powder\nto cover the bruise and his jaw clenched and he huffed through his\nnose for the thousandth time. He hated this. He was hired to protect\nher but he was somewhat powerless to protect her from Joffrey, the mob boss who hired him and who had been the only real threat to her\nsafety. \n</p><p>He delicately moved\nthe back of her dress over so that the powder wouldn&rsquo;t get on it\nand after a moment of trying to cover the bruise and turned the dark\npurple bruise to a barely dark shadow, he realized that that was the\nbest that powder could do and left it alone and moved her dress back.\nSansa, once she realized he was done, said a small but grateful word\nof &lsquo;thanks&rsquo; and kept walking towards the stage where she took a\ndeep breath to calm her nerves. \n</p><p>&ldquo;I could keep you\nsafe,&rdquo; Sandor rasped in her ear as they stood in the wing. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re\nall afraid of me. No one would hurt you again, or I&rsquo;d kill them.&rdquo;\nSandor offered so softly in her ear behind her that only Sansa would\nhear him. \n</p><p>&ldquo;No one can truly protect me, no one can protect anyone, not from him. I know you\ndo all you can but&hellip;&rdquo; Sansa whispered back over her shoulder as\nshe slid her mask away so to speak to give him a true look that broke\nhis heart more than her bruises did. He was the one person she\nallowed to see her without her &lsquo;mask&rsquo; anymore because he was the\none person who had proved beyond the shadow of a doubt that she was\nsafe to be herself with, a luxury that she had no idea would be as\nprecious as it was. \n</p><p>&ldquo;He can&rsquo;t reach\neverywhere Little Bird, there are cities big enough and depths deep\nenough that I could take you to where no one would find us.&rdquo; Sandor\npromised. \n</p><p>&ldquo;Where would that\nbe?&rdquo; Sansa asked, her tone disbelieving but almost hopeful. \n</p><p>&ldquo;Chicago or New\nYork for starters, besides it&rsquo;s only a matter of time before he\ngets what&rsquo;s coming to him.&rdquo; Sandor immediately answered, a ghost\nof a grin on his lips. \n</p><p>&ldquo;When?&rdquo; Sansa\nsuddenly asked as she caught a glimpse of Joffery with his gang in\nthe audience at the best table. That tramp Margaery on one of his\narms and laughing at nearly everything he said. \n</p><p>&ldquo;Tonight, I&rsquo;ll\neven pack while you sing.&rdquo; Sandor offered as his heart almost began\nto soar. \n</p><p>&ldquo;No, with you\nbeing gone from your post, they&rsquo;d know something was up.&rdquo; Sansa\nreasoned and Sandor knew she was right, that was just wishful\nthinking on his part. \n</p><p>&ldquo;We could leave in\nthe middle of the night then, just pack what you absolutely can not\nlive without.&rdquo; Sandor pleaded. \n</p><p>&ldquo;What about my\npay?&rdquo; Sansa asked. \n</p><p>&ldquo;What pay? Like I\nsaid, he doesn&rsquo;t really put it in the bank, he blows it, there is\nnone Little Bird, that&rsquo;s just how he keeps you here in this god\nforsaken cage.&rdquo; Sandor insisted and Sansa knew he was probably\ntelling the truth. She hadn&rsquo;t wanted to believe him the first time he told her that but the more time went on, the more she believed that claim.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;What about Arya?\nWhat about Lady?&rdquo; Sansa asked, knowing Sandor had been keeping Arya safely hidden, disguised as a boy in his apartment nearby. \n</p><p>&ldquo;They can come\ntoo, I know Arya wouldn&rsquo;t leave without Nymeria anyway.&rdquo; Sandor\npromised. \n</p><p>Then Sansa took a\nmoment to think it over before she gave him the nod and a smirking\nsmile. <i>She was in</i> and Sandor wanted to kiss her and run away\nthat instant but he had to bide his time and Sansa&rsquo;s mask slid back\ninto place and she strutted out to the middle of the stage behind the\ncurtain and became the canary she was. \n</p><p>&ldquo;<i>You had plenty\nmoney 1922&hellip;</i>&rdquo; Sansa began to sing sensually as she lifted her\nleg to spread the curtains before they were pulled apart to reveal\nher as the crowd cheered and Sandor watched, still mesmerized by her\nfor a moment before he remembered his job and had to map out the\nplace, realize who was who in the crowd from his vantage point as he\nmoved both of his hands to rest on the handles of his enforcers, just\nin case- as he realized all he really needed was his tommy guns, he\ncould strong arm the rest to take care of her. \n</p><p>Sansa finished her\nset and came out and socialized with the crowd, as was her job,\nbefore she sat with Joffrey and Margaery, putting on a smile and\nacted like nothing was the matter at all and once she was there,\nSandor moved and went to get his tommy guns from the back, where\neveryone kept their guns when not in use, this club was a front for\nJoffrey&rsquo;s mob after all. \n</p><p>&ldquo;Whatcha doin?&rdquo;\nThe lieutenant in charge of the guns asked Sandor curiously as Sandor\narmed himself even more than he already was. &nbsp;\n</p><p>&ldquo;I got a bad\nfeeling, but don&rsquo;t say nothin to the boss, don&rsquo;t want to spoil\nhis evening or his mood.&rdquo; Sandor answered nonchalantly as he loaded\nthem and slung them around his shoulders so that they laid against\nhis sides and put on a trench coat to cover it all before he came\nback out and stood guard over <i>his dame</i> again as he mentally\nfantasized about just opening fire on his boss and all those at the\ntable with them once Sansa would leave the table to go back into her\ncage, but he did not, but the fantasy did put the smallest of smirks\non his lips. \n</p><p>When Sansa was\ndismissed, she quickly packed her suitcase with everything she held\nmost dear and then hid it under her bed, just in case Joffrey came\nback to say good night as she lazily took off all her makeup and did\nher hair up in pin curls and put on her cold creams and such and\nsimply dressed in her night gown and a robe to make it look like she was getting ready for bed just like any other night.

He\nprotected her the best he could, he protected her from everyone,\nexcept Joffrey and even then, he did all he could to try and curb\nJoffrey&rsquo;s temper when it seemed to get unleashed on her, reminding\nJoffrey that he couldn&rsquo;t beat her black and blue, not when she was\nexpected to perform and that no makeup in the world could cover up\nthe harm he wanted to cause her and how Joffrey would loose money and\npopularity if he clipped his canary&rsquo;s wings so short she couldn&rsquo;t\nsing for him, <i>for anyone</i> and that seemed to be the only thing that\nkept Joffrey at bay, but he still struck her bad enough in a spot she\ncould easily cover up to get out his rage since he was loosing money\nfaster than he was making it, even though he had the city in a\nstrangle hold as it was and was currently bleeding it dry. &nbsp;\n</p><p>But during the\nnights like this, Sandor allowed himself to come into her cage with\nher and she would sing for him a song she reserved only for him and\nit was sweeter than any music ever could be. \n</p><p>&ldquo;How much longer?&rdquo;\nSansa asked in a hushed whisper as she took his hat off and set it\ndown on the bedside table before she kissed his scars tenderly, the\nonly woman to ever do so. \n</p><p>&ldquo;Only a few hours,\nmake sure everyone is asleep, before the bakers awake though.&rdquo;\nSandor breathed into her skin as his course hands threatened to snag\nthe delicate satin of her nightgown as he gathered it up to her waist\nas she undid the high waistband&rsquo;s button and unzipped his zipper of\nhis trousers and un-clipped the suspenders from his waist band to get\nhis pants down before he finally put a rubber on to protect her from\ngetting pregnant and sheathed himself to the hilt in her, drinking\ndown her keening moan in a deep kiss. He did have the largest cock in\nthe whole mob and it was the only one Sansa enjoyed riding and\nenjoyed getting fucked into oblivion with. Of course who it belonged\nto made all the difference too. Sandor actually loved her and never\nhurt her, especially like this or in this way, it had taken Sandor\nover the course of a couple of months of gentle caresses and really\nbeing kind, gentle and patient with her before she enjoyed his touch the way she was\nmeant to before she outright asked for it and physically put his\nhands on her so she would feel loved instead of hated. And finally\nafter their first time together, it was like this sweet innocent who\nonly played a vixen on stage fully came into her own and they fucked\nevery chance they got, but of course it had to be in secret or else\nJoffrey would send them both to swim with the fishes or put them on\nice. \n</p><p>&ldquo;Well then we\ndefinitely have time for <i>at least</i> one more romp.&rdquo; Sansa\nbeamed cheekily as she locked her ankles behind the small of his back\nto keep him in place. \n</p><p>&ldquo;At least two.&rdquo;\nSandor rumbled as his hips snapped into hers and he powered a good\nstroke into her, making her eyes fall shut and the most amazing\nkeening moan spill from her throat as her hands went underneath his\njacket to claw at his back over his dress shirt. \n</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget to\nsing for me Little Bird.&rdquo; Sandor grunted into her ear. \n</p><p>&ldquo;Only if you&rsquo;ll\nhowl back Hound.&rdquo; Sansa purred into his ear before he pulled her\nbreasts from her the top of her night gown to suckle at them and tease her nipples by\nnipping at them, not painfully but enough to really light her on fire\nso to speak as she hissed and gasped in sex hazed delight as his hips\nsped up, trying to get Sansa to her release before he came to his.\nThe one thing he could always give her that didn&rsquo;t cost him\nanything but time, effort and patience. But those he would always gladly spend on her anyway.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Sandor.&rdquo; Sansa\nwhimpered as her face flashed pain but she wasn&rsquo;t suffering, far\nfrom it- as she wrapped her arms under his suit jacket and held him\nclose, loving the fiery furnace he always seemed to be, she would\nnever go cold at night ever again. Because after tonight, he wouldn&rsquo;t\nbe leaving her bed at night. He&rsquo;d actually be able to sleep with\nher without worry- especially about if whether or not Joffrey and his\nthugs were coming and he&rsquo;d actually take all of his clothes off for\nonce, instead of only shoving his pants down so he could get\nredressed within a quick second if need be, something that had saved\nthem both on several occasions. \n</p><p>&ldquo;Sansa,&rdquo; Sandor\nwhispered back, one of the few times he didn&rsquo;t use his affectionate\nnick name for her before she finally sang as much as she could\nwithout getting anyone&rsquo;s attention as she found her release, her\nwhole body tensing as her inner walls fluttered and constricted\naround his hardened length, even through the thick rubber condom that\nhe could feel her as he finally slammed into her, grinding out his\nown release as he grunted and growled into her own ear as he nipped\nat her ear lobe playfully as she finally laxed as they both breathed\nheavily as they basked in the afterglow and recovered. \n</p><p>Sandor and Sansa\nmade love one more time as they waited until a quarter to three in\nthe morning, to make sure everyone was asleep before they slipped\naway into the night and drove to New York, Lady in Sansa&rsquo;s lap in\nthe front seat and Arya stretched out in the backseat, Nymeria in her\nlap as she was wearing her own zoot suit with matching hat and had\nher own tommy gun next to her, ready to shoot whoever would be\nfollowing them. Sandor held onto Sansa&rsquo;s hand, kissing it softly\nand reverently from time to time as he drove them to the safety of\nthe biggest apple of all as all three of them, Sansa especially,\nfinally smiling genuinely for once. \n</p></p>",

Which it was or if it was both, Brienne could not say. For she was with her Lady far more than she is with him.</p><p>&ldquo;If it isn&rsquo;t the Stark touch by flame,&rdquo; Greets the red-headed wildling. The man who had so oddly eaten his food before. Brienne often caught him staring at her. Probably sizing her up to see if he could win a fight between the two. From what she had seen of him it would be an easy win.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, wildling?&rdquo; Sansa greets him dismissively. He was one of the men Jon took counsel from when they were at the wall. That earned him no special privilege in Sansa&rsquo;s eyes. One is greeted as one greets.</p><p>&ldquo;She Stark,&rdquo; he begins with the feral grin of his.</p><p>&ldquo;Lady Stark,&rdquo; Brienne corrects.</p><p>His smiles grows as soon as she speaks. Brienne steps closer to Sansa. The man did not strike her as a threat but any man that paid that much attention to her usually was planning for a fight.</p><p>&ldquo;Lady Stark.&rdquo; He repeats with a softer tone. His eyes never leave her as he speaks. &ldquo;Yer lord brother is seakin&rsquo; you. We may be abandoning this castle of stone.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you. I will go find him right away.&rdquo;</p><p>That was when he moves closer to Brienne. &ldquo;Large lady I have seen you around before. You can fight. That is good. Women who can fight have powerful children. Yours would be beautiful too.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Please step away from my lady,&rdquo; Brienne asks politely trying to keep the heat from rushing to her face. This man was strange.</p><p>&ldquo;I am Tormund. I will see you on the field of battle.&rdquo; With that, the wilding smiles at Brienne again before stepping away.</p><p>&ldquo;He likes you,&rdquo; Her lady stares as soon as he was out of view.</p><p>Brienne shivers. &ldquo;Not to argue with you Lady Stark, but men do not &lsquo;like&rsquo; me. They challenge me.&rdquo; The only men to have ever pretended otherwise either wanted to get closer to her father or to tear her down. Brienne refused to deal with either sort of man now.</p><p>&ldquo;He likes you. Jon and Sandor have both told me so. Along with words of giant bears and children who will conquer.&rdquo; Sansa states allowing a small smile to grace her lips.</p><p>&ldquo;My lady now is not the time to think of such things.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Spring will come, and with it, life will go on,&rdquo; Sansa explains stopping by a window to watch the snow.</p><p>Her lady may feel as if Spring&rsquo;s return was definite, but the legends the common northerners tell hold to the end of the world in eternal winter. When the lands are frozen over, and all that is left would be those who brought it about. Brienne can feel the cold crawling down her spine once more. Yet again Lady Sansa looks warm. The cold does not affect the Starks as it does others. Brienne wanders if perhaps they will be the only ones to survive this season.</p>",
