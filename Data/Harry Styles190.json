It\u2019s always exhausting which doesn\u2019t help the tension that was between you and Harry. So you asked him to have a private breakfast that day. You were in his hotel room and just started eating when you brought it up.</p><p>\u201cHarry, we still haven\u2019t talked about some things, and I feel we need to.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just want to say that those messages broke my heart every time I got them. They were absurd but still a little doubt was in me, a \u2018What if?\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>\u201cI love you with all my heart, but I\u2019m insecure about some things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI must admit I was thinking what if you really love Louis. More than you love me. And I was mad because he walked in and stole you with his charm and sadness that you must\u2019ve helped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do love him, but not like I love you\u201d you smiled. </p><p>\u201cSo it\u2019s not weird that we\u2019re still insecure?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, but I want to do against it. Right now the schedule is so strict we can barely do anything besides work, but as soon as we will have a little more free time, we could work on it\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like a plan\u201d he smiled.</p><p>\u201cDeal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeal.\u201d</p><p>What you didn\u2019t mention was that you didn\u2019t like that Kacey is all the time with Harry. But this time the schedule was really strict and you wanted to focus on your work. You barely spent more time with Harry that day. After breakfast you all went to the venue and you started working in your dressing room. You opened Spotify and you saw that 5sos just released their new album. You listened to it whole day on repeat. But there was one song that you loved so much, because you always went back to that one. Lie to Me. </p><p>You were so into it when there was a knock on your door. Sarah and Clare came after. </p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d </p><p>\u201cWe heard the music and came in\u201d Sarah said.</p><p>\u201cBut we actually wanted to see you, girl\u201d Clare added. </p><p>\u201cThanks\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou look all sad recently so we want to cheer you up a bit\u201d Sarah winked. They had a bottle of cider for the three of you. So you found yourself drinking and laughing with Sarah and Clare that afternoon. It was so much fun. You talked about a lot of things and tried to come up with some conspiracy theories and actually you found out that you were in Harry\u2019s Gucci ad video last time, but you were under cover. You even had a search about all of you on the dark web of blogs. It was nice to see that mostly you all had your own fans and they loved and supported all of you. As a band and as individuals too. But soon a feeling hit you. You didn\u2019t miss Harry at all. In the last few months, since you dated him, you always ached to be with him all the time. But now you were happy \u201calone\u201d and didn\u2019t even think about what he\u2019s doing. It scared you. Adam dragged you out of your thoughts when he came in and said that they should do soundcheck but Sarah and Clare are missing. They went to soundcheck but you stayed and sat down a bit. Your clothes arrived soon and you put them on, realizing that it\u2019s almost the same as Harry\u2019s so you\u2019re gonna be twinning again. You called Lottie and she was on speaker. </p><p>\u201cHi, darling!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello, old friend!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOld friend? You\u2019re missing me, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t seen you since May, what do you think?\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh, Lottie darling, I miss you too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnyways, thank you to talk to Louis about me\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, God! I\u2019m so sorry I forgot to and now he\u2019s in London\u2026\u201d you said because you were sure she sarcastically thanked you. </p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about? Yesterday he called me and we\u2019re having dinner tomorrow\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat what? He kind of asked me on a date\u201d </p><p>\u201cWow, but I approve it\u201d you smiled.<br/></p><p>\u201cThanks! So you really haven\u2019t talked to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I forgot.\u201d you admitted.</p><p>\u201cThen it\u2019s genuine, I like it\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cLook, I gotta go\u201d you said when you saw Harry look into your room asking for permission to enter. \u201cLove you\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove you too, give a hug to Harry for me\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d You hung up. </p><p>\u201cWe finished soundcheck, twin\u201d he smiled. </p><p>\u201cGreat\u201d you stood up and hugged him. \u201cI don\u2019t want to lose you, Harry\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would you lose me, love?\u201d he chuckled and tightened the hug.</p><p>\u201cDunno\u201d you sighed. \u201cI just don\u2019t want to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI miss you\u201d he said. It would\u2019ve been strange to hear, but you felt the same too. You were in each other\u2019s company 24/7 but still felt like you\u2019re not together. In body he was there, but you two didn\u2019t connect most of the time. You felt that you\u2019re on the way of healing, but you knew that another problem could tear this apart.</p><p>\u201cLottie sent a hug\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I should call her, it was a while ago when we talked. How\u2019s she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s got a date\u201d you smiled.</p><p>\u201cWow, do I know the guy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you do\u201d you smiled at him while he sat down. Harry frowned when he saw you smirk.</p><p>\u201cLouis\u201d you said and his eyes widened.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah, I was surprised too. But Lottie loves him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he makes a wrong move\u2026\u201d \u00a0he said, being protective of his favourite pregnant woman.</p><p>\u201cIf she makes a wrong move\u2026\u201d you said, being protective of your friend. You laughed together. </p><p>A voice came on your walkie: \u201cFive minutes before going to stage, Harry.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhy did he say Harry if I don\u2019t have a walkie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I guess it\u2019s so obvious that you\u2019re with me\u201d you said to him. \u201cCopied\u201d you said to the walkie.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go, put on a show\u201d you reached your hand for him to take it. He grabbed it and then pulled you into a side hug and that\u2019s how you walked through the whole building. There was still a minute before he had to leave, his phone was with him and he sent a text to Lottie.</p><p>\u201cIs it okay if I anonymously talk about you in front of an arena?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t be anon, they\u2019ve seen your face\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u201d</p><p>\u201cDOn\u2019t have to be anon, make me famous so I will get enough money to set up my own company\u201d </p><p>\u201cTake care mama bear\u201d</p><p>The concert was great. Harry promised to sign a shoe of a fan and found a pregnant lady. He offered her a seat and started talking with her. It was all funny and you hid your face in your palms when he complimented her \u201cCongratulations on having sex at least twice\u201d and you were like \u201cOh God! I\u2019m dating a comedian\u201d But surprisingly he added some more stories.</p><p>\u201cYou know, I have a friend. She\u2019s pregnant. I know you watch the live stream, darling even though it\u2019s like early morning in London. Lottie, I just want you to know, that you\u2019re gonna be an amazing mum and you have my back, whatever happens, we\u2019ll help you through it. She\u2019s lovely and the best barista in London\u201d he winked. \u201cShe\u2019s the only person who has the right to kick my arse anytime. I don\u2019 tell her everyday, but she\u2019s a good friend of mine and I\u2019m happy I\u2019ve got to know her through my uhm\u2026 best friend. So the next song&hellip;\u201d you were in tears and Lottie was in tears too. She sent you a text: \u201cGive an even bigger hug and a kiss to his face. I\u2019m sobbing. I\u2019ll call him later.\u201d</p><p>It meant a lot to her because she was always doubting she\u2019s gonna be a good mother and she can take care of a child. She needed it and you were amazed how much Harry cared about her. Before the concert ended you found the person Harry promised a sign for and took her out of the crowd by security. You walked her to Harry in his dressing room. They spent a few minutes together and then she left. </p><p>\u201cThank you for all your kind words to Lottie, she said she\u2019s gonna call you later, but she was really emotional. I know it means a lot to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know she needed that and I meant every word I said\u201d he smiled. </p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"268\" data-orig-width=\"268\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"beststyles:JnyJooR-AQTc6F1ANzQYvw:ZXMRId2Ywqt8Z\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/a9bc89cc3668bb6121ca33b955c29dac/tumblr_paebz3UJ9b1wvkvsio1_400.gif\" data-orig-height=\"268\" data-orig-width=\"268\"/></figure><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"268\" data-orig-width=\"268\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"thestylesgifs:-kghtBulJV3esyD9oVfVFQ:Z3JQ8h2YxdXQK\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/1047a88bf86cb9d2810e6c8c55e9f6db/tumblr_paf9ad7EPm1vtwrluo1_400.gif\" data-orig-height=\"268\" data-orig-width=\"268\"/></figure><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"360\" data-orig-width=\"403\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"1dlarryluv:HsykshiEUgQ1KjH6w1rKJA:ZMx5Vo2Yy3IeK\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/1de23d262dedf0c9ec356e3201c52017/tumblr_pafnegCMbG1ts2grho1_500.gif\" data-orig-height=\"360\" data-orig-width=\"403\"/></figure>",

Lie to Me. </p><p>You were so into it when there was a knock on your door. Sarah and Clare came after. </p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d </p><p>\u201cWe heard the music and came in\u201d Sarah said.</p><p>\u201cBut we actually wanted to see you, girl\u201d Clare added. </p><p>\u201cThanks\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou look all sad recently so we want to cheer you up a bit\u201d Sarah winked. They had a bottle of cider for the three of you. So you found yourself drinking and laughing with Sarah and Clare that afternoon. It was so much fun. You talked about a lot of things and tried to come up with some conspiracy theories and actually you found out that you were in Harry\u2019s Gucci ad video last time, but you were under cover. You even had a search about all of you on the dark web of blogs. It was nice to see that mostly you all had your own fans and they loved and supported all of you. As a band and as individuals too. But soon a feeling hit you. You didn\u2019t miss Harry at all. In the last few months, since you dated him, you always ached to be with him all the time. But now you were happy \u201calone\u201d and didn\u2019t even think about what he\u2019s doing. It scared you. Adam dragged you out of your thoughts when he came in and said that they should do soundcheck but Sarah and Clare are missing. They went to soundcheck but you stayed and sat down a bit. Your clothes arrived soon and you put them on, realizing that it\u2019s almost the same as Harry\u2019s so you\u2019re gonna be twinning again. You called Lottie and she was on speaker. </p><p>\u201cHi, darling!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello, old friend!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOld friend? You\u2019re missing me, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t seen you since May, what do you think?\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh, Lottie darling, I miss you too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnyways, thank you to talk to Louis about me\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, God! I\u2019m so sorry I forgot to and now he\u2019s in London\u2026\u201d you said because you were sure she sarcastically thanked you. </p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about? Yesterday he called me and we\u2019re having dinner tomorrow\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat what? He kind of asked me on a date\u201d </p><p>\u201cWow, but I approve it\u201d you smiled.<br></p><p>\u201cThanks! So you really haven\u2019t talked to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I forgot.\u201d you admitted.</p><p>\u201cThen it\u2019s genuine, I like it\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cLook, I gotta go\u201d you said when you saw Harry look into your room asking for permission to enter. \u201cLove you\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove you too, give a hug to Harry for me\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d You hung up. </p><p>\u201cWe finished soundcheck, twin\u201d he smiled. </p><p>\u201cGreat\u201d you stood up and hugged him. \u201cI don\u2019t want to lose you, Harry\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would you lose me, love?\u201d he chuckled and tightened the hug.</p><p>\u201cDunno\u201d you sighed. \u201cI just don\u2019t want to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI miss you\u201d he said. It would\u2019ve been strange to hear, but you felt the same too. You were in each other\u2019s company 24/7 but still felt like you\u2019re not together. In body he was there, but you two didn\u2019t connect most of the time. You felt that you\u2019re on the way of healing, but you knew that another problem could tear this apart.</p><p>\u201cLottie sent a hug\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I should call her, it was a while ago when we talked. How\u2019s she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s got a date\u201d you smiled.</p><p>\u201cWow, do I know the guy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you do\u201d you smiled at him while he sat down. Harry frowned when he saw you smirk.</p><p>\u201cLouis\u201d you said and his eyes widened.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah, I was surprised too. But Lottie loves him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he makes a wrong move\u2026\u201d \u00a0he said, being protective of his favourite pregnant woman.</p><p>\u201cIf she makes a wrong move\u2026\u201d you said, being protective of your friend. You laughed together. </p><p>A voice came on your walkie: \u201cFive minutes before going to stage, Harry.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhy did he say Harry if I don\u2019t have a walkie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I guess it\u2019s so obvious that you\u2019re with me\u201d you said to him. \u201cCopied\u201d you said to the walkie.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go, put on a show\u201d you reached your hand for him to take it. He grabbed it and then pulled you into a side hug and that\u2019s how you walked through the whole building. There was still a minute before he had to leave, his phone was with him and he sent a text to Lottie.</p><p>\u201cIs it okay if I anonymously talk about you in front of an arena?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t be anon, they\u2019ve seen your face\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u201d</p><p>\u201cDOn\u2019t have to be anon, make me famous so I will get enough money to set up my own company\u201d </p><p>\u201cTake care mama bear\u201d</p><p>The concert was great. Harry promised to sign a shoe of a fan and found a pregnant lady. He offered her a seat and started talking with her. It was all funny and you hid your face in your palms when he complimented her \u201cCongratulations on having sex at least twice\u201d and you were like \u201cOh God! I\u2019m dating a comedian\u201d But surprisingly he added some more stories.</p><p>\u201cYou know, I have a friend. She\u2019s pregnant. I know you watch the live stream, darling even though it\u2019s like early morning in London. Lottie, I just want you to know, that you\u2019re gonna be an amazing mum and you have my back, whatever happens, we\u2019ll help you through it. She\u2019s lovely and the best barista in London\u201d he winked. \u201cShe\u2019s the only person who has the right to kick my arse anytime. I don\u2019 tell her everyday, but she\u2019s a good friend of mine and I\u2019m happy I\u2019ve got to know her through my uhm\u2026 best friend. So the next song\u2026\u201d you were in tears and Lottie was in tears too. She sent you a text: \u201cGive an even bigger hug and a kiss to his face. I\u2019m sobbing. I\u2019ll call him later.\u201d</p><p>It meant a lot to her because she was always doubting she\u2019s gonna be a good mother and she can take care of a child. She needed it and you were amazed how much Harry cared about her. Before the concert ended you found the person Harry promised a sign for and took her out of the crowd by security. You walked her to Harry in his dressing room. They spent a few minutes together and then she left. </p><p>\u201cThank you for all your kind words to Lottie, she said she\u2019s gonna call you later, but she was really emotional. I know it means a lot to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know she needed that and I meant every word I said\u201d he smiled. </p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"268\" data-orig-width=\"268\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"beststyles:JnyJooR-AQTc6F1ANzQYvw:ZXMRId2Ywqt8Z\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/a9bc89cc3668bb6121ca33b955c29dac/tumblr_paebz3UJ9b1wvkvsio1_400.gif\" data-orig-height=\"268\" data-orig-width=\"268\"></figure><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"268\" data-orig-width=\"268\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"thestylesgifs:-kghtBulJV3esyD9oVfVFQ:Z3JQ8h2YxdXQK\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/1047a88bf86cb9d2810e6c8c55e9f6db/tumblr_paf9ad7EPm1vtwrluo1_400.gif\" data-orig-height=\"268\" data-orig-width=\"268\"></figure><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"360\" data-orig-width=\"403\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"1dlarryluv:HsykshiEUgQ1KjH6w1rKJA:ZMx5Vo2Yy3IeK\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/1de23d262dedf0c9ec356e3201c52017/tumblr_pafnegCMbG1ts2grho1_500.gif\" data-orig-height=\"360\" data-orig-width=\"403\"></figure></p>",

Right now the schedule is so strict we can barely do anything besides work, but as soon as we will have a little more free time, we could work on it\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like a plan\u201d he smiled.</p><p>\u201cDeal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeal.\u201d</p><p>What you didn\u2019t mention was that you didn\u2019t like that Kacey is all the time with Harry. But this time the schedule was really strict and you wanted to focus on your work. You barely spent more time with Harry that day. After breakfast you all went to the venue and you started working in your dressing room. You opened Spotify and you saw that 5sos just released their new album.

It&rsquo;s always exhausting which doesn&rsquo;t help the tension that was between you and Harry. So you asked him to have a private breakfast that day. You were in his hotel room and just started eating when you brought it up.</p><p>&ldquo;Harry, we still haven&rsquo;t talked about some things, and I feel we need to.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I know.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I just want to say that those messages broke my heart every time I got them. They were absurd but still a little doubt was in me, a &lsquo;What if?&rdquo;</p><p>Silence.</p><p>&ldquo;I love you with all my heart, but I&rsquo;m insecure about some things.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I must admit I was thinking what if you really love Louis. More than you love me. And I was mad because he walked in and stole you with his charm and sadness that you must&rsquo;ve helped.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I do love him, but not like I love you&rdquo; you smiled. </p><p>&ldquo;So it&rsquo;s not weird that we&rsquo;re still insecure?&rdquo; he asked.</p><p>&ldquo;No, but I want to do against it. Right now the schedule is so strict we can barely do anything besides work, but as soon as we will have a little more free time, we could work on it&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sounds like a plan&rdquo; he smiled.</p><p>&ldquo;Deal.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Deal.&rdquo;</p><p>What you didn&rsquo;t mention was that you didn&rsquo;t like that Kacey is all the time with Harry. But this time the schedule was really strict and you wanted to focus on your work. You barely spent more time with Harry that day. After breakfast you all went to the venue and you started working in your dressing room. You opened Spotify and you saw that 5sos just released their new album. You listened to it whole day on repeat. But there was one song that you loved so much, because you always went back to that one. Lie to Me. </p><p>You were so into it when there was a knock on your door. Sarah and Clare came after. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey!&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;We heard the music and came in&rdquo; Sarah said.</p><p>&ldquo;But we actually wanted to see you, girl&rdquo; Clare added. </p><p>&ldquo;Thanks&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You look all sad recently so we want to cheer you up a bit&rdquo; Sarah winked. They had a bottle of cider for the three of you. So you found yourself drinking and laughing with Sarah and Clare that afternoon. It was so much fun. You talked about a lot of things and tried to come up with some conspiracy theories and actually you found out that you were in Harry&rsquo;s Gucci ad video last time, but you were under cover. You even had a search about all of you on the dark web of blogs. It was nice to see that mostly you all had your own fans and they loved and supported all of you. As a band and as individuals too. But soon a feeling hit you. You didn&rsquo;t miss Harry at all. In the last few months, since you dated him, you always ached to be with him all the time. But now you were happy &ldquo;alone&rdquo; and didn&rsquo;t even think about what he&rsquo;s doing. It scared you. Adam dragged you out of your thoughts when he came in and said that they should do soundcheck but Sarah and Clare are missing. They went to soundcheck but you stayed and sat down a bit. Your clothes arrived soon and you put them on, realizing that it&rsquo;s almost the same as Harry&rsquo;s so you&rsquo;re gonna be twinning again. You called Lottie and she was on speaker. </p><p>&ldquo;Hi, darling!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hello, old friend!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Old friend? You&rsquo;re missing me, huh?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t seen you since May, what do you think?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Oh, Lottie darling, I miss you too.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Anyways, thank you to talk to Louis about me&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, God! I&rsquo;m so sorry I forgot to and now he&rsquo;s in London&hellip;&rdquo; you said because you were sure she sarcastically thanked you. </p><p>&ldquo;What are you talking about? Yesterday he called me and we&rsquo;re having dinner tomorrow&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What what? He kind of asked me on a date&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Wow, but I approve it&rdquo; you smiled.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Thanks! So you really haven&rsquo;t talked to him?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, I forgot.&rdquo; you admitted.</p><p>&ldquo;Then it&rsquo;s genuine, I like it&rdquo; she said.</p><p>&ldquo;Look, I gotta go&rdquo; you said when you saw Harry look into your room asking for permission to enter. &ldquo;Love you&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Love you too, give a hug to Harry for me&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I will.&rdquo; You hung up. </p><p>&ldquo;We finished soundcheck, twin&rdquo; he smiled. </p><p>&ldquo;Great&rdquo; you stood up and hugged him. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to lose you, Harry&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why would you lose me, love?&rdquo; he chuckled and tightened the hug.</p><p>&ldquo;Dunno&rdquo; you sighed. &ldquo;I just don&rsquo;t want to.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I miss you&rdquo; he said. It would&rsquo;ve been strange to hear, but you felt the same too. You were in each other&rsquo;s company 24/7 but still felt like you&rsquo;re not together. In body he was there, but you two didn&rsquo;t connect most of the time. You felt that you&rsquo;re on the way of healing, but you knew that another problem could tear this apart.</p><p>&ldquo;Lottie sent a hug&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, I should call her, it was a while ago when we talked. How&rsquo;s she?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s got a date&rdquo; you smiled.</p><p>&ldquo;Wow, do I know the guy?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, you do&rdquo; you smiled at him while he sat down. Harry frowned when he saw you smirk.</p><p>&ldquo;Louis&rdquo; you said and his eyes widened.</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, I was surprised too. But Lottie loves him.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If he makes a wrong move&hellip;&rdquo; &nbsp;he said, being protective of his favourite pregnant woman.</p><p>&ldquo;If she makes a wrong move&hellip;&rdquo; you said, being protective of your friend. You laughed together. </p><p>A voice came on your walkie: &ldquo;Five minutes before going to stage, Harry.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Why did he say Harry if I don&rsquo;t have a walkie?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I guess it&rsquo;s so obvious that you&rsquo;re with me&rdquo; you said to him. &ldquo;Copied&rdquo; you said to the walkie.</p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go, put on a show&rdquo; you reached your hand for him to take it. He grabbed it and then pulled you into a side hug and that&rsquo;s how you walked through the whole building. There was still a minute before he had to leave, his phone was with him and he sent a text to Lottie.</p><p>&ldquo;Is it okay if I anonymously talk about you in front of an arena?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t be anon, they&rsquo;ve seen your face&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;DOn&rsquo;t have to be anon, make me famous so I will get enough money to set up my own company&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Take care mama bear&rdquo;</p><p>The concert was great. Harry promised to sign a shoe of a fan and found a pregnant lady. He offered her a seat and started talking with her. It was all funny and you hid your face in your palms when he complimented her &ldquo;Congratulations on having sex at least twice&rdquo; and you were like &ldquo;Oh God! I&rsquo;m dating a comedian&rdquo; But surprisingly he added some more stories.</p><p>&ldquo;You know, I have a friend. She&rsquo;s pregnant. I know you watch the live stream, darling even though it&rsquo;s like early morning in London. Lottie, I just want you to know, that you&rsquo;re gonna be an amazing mum and you have my back, whatever happens, we&rsquo;ll help you through it. She&rsquo;s lovely and the best barista in London&rdquo; he winked. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s the only person who has the right to kick my arse anytime. I don&rsquo; tell her everyday, but she&rsquo;s a good friend of mine and I&rsquo;m happy I&rsquo;ve got to know her through my uhm&hellip; best friend. So the next song&hellip;&rdquo; you were in tears and Lottie was in tears too. She sent you a text: &ldquo;Give an even bigger hug and a kiss to his face. I&rsquo;m sobbing. I&rsquo;ll call him later.&rdquo;</p><p>It meant a lot to her because she was always doubting she&rsquo;s gonna be a good mother and she can take care of a child. She needed it and you were amazed how much Harry cared about her. Before the concert ended you found the person Harry promised a sign for and took her out of the crowd by security. You walked her to Harry in his dressing room. They spent a few minutes together and then she left. </p><p>&ldquo;Thank you for all your kind words to Lottie, she said she&rsquo;s gonna call you later, but she was really emotional. I know it means a lot to her.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know she needed that and I meant every word I said&rdquo; he smiled. </p><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"0\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"1\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"2\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure></p>",

He does not register the silence until it\nsubmerges the entire apartment. His ears strain to catch even the faintest\nsound on the other side of the door. The painted walls muffle her movements;\nnot a single light shines from the crack at his feet.</p><p>The poor\nman is a blossoming flower; petals of sweetness expand from the force of\nnature\u2019s love. He is powerful, but the dirt pulls him to the ground with its\nmuddy hands, and steadies him for the hurricane that is to strike. He cannot\nmove. He stands and relives the events that baffle his brain: she walks away;\nshe dismisses him with a fragile goodnight, a farewell that he fears will be\nthe last; he confesses his secrets and she scrambles with strange abandonment.\nOver a dozen times does he relive those taunting moments, seconds ticking\nfurther and further away.</p><p>This\ndoesn\u2019t make the least bit of sense to him. He can imagine it from his\nperspective without strife. He professes his love, and it unveils a grand twist\nto their years-long story. He can taste the sorrow on her lips, a mixture of\nsalt and relief. He can feel the dip in her neck where his eager hands find a\nhome, fingertips pressing with a passion. He can imagine her sweet lips to\nconfess the eight letters that welcome heaven to his heart. When he opens his\neyes, he stares at an empty wall instead. Her presence lingers, but she is not\nhere.\u00a0</p><p>Harry\ndoesn\u2019t make a sound. He doesn\u2019t know if she sleeps tenderly under the comfort\nof her sheets \u2013 if exhaustion makes it that much easier for her to rest. He\ndoes not pick apart his brain to imagine, because to imagine her all snug in\nhis shaded arms is too much to bear. Consequently, with the last ounce of\nenergy that he has left, he shakes the desire from his clouded mind, and walks\naway.</p><p><b><i>&gt;Can you please call me back?</i></b><b><i>\u00a0</i></b></p><p><b><i>&gt;I\u2019m sorry if I was pressuring you. It wasn\u2019t my intention.</i></b><b><i>\u00a0</i></b></p><p><b><i>&gt;I leave on the sixth. Can we please talk before then?</i></b></p><p>Messages\nslither their way into Harry\u2019s everyday routine. Unanswered calls are a given, and\nhis desperate voicemails are almost therapeutic. His time ticks away, and it\nfills with him an anxiety that no crowd can ever compare with. In the days that\nfollow, he succumbs to self-hatred. He will never forgive himself for ruining\nsomething so special. A fresh sheet once written with loving memories is\nnothing but a smudge of ink, a ball that he crumples with his own bare hands.\nThe wrinkles and creases can never return to their former smooth state,\neternally marking his selfish behavior in the folded lines.</p><p>Four days\ncome and go. He goes longer periods of time without communicating with y/n, but\nthis particular situation has his head spinning off and into the clouds. She\nhas yet to call him back, and he will have to leave soon. His career requires\nhis attention elsewhere, in places that y/n cannot go. Somewhere in his mind,\nhe wonders if that is her plan. Does she count the days, waiting for him to\ndisappear so that <i>finally</i> she can\ntoo?<br/></p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d\nHarry asks her. His legs dangle, knees bent at the edge of the hotel bed. His\nbody spreads across the center. One hand covers his face, index finger and\nthumb rubbing harshly against his eyes. The other clutches his phone, and\npresses it against his flaming ear. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you picking up your phone? You\ncouldn\u2019t have thrown it out the window again. Why can\u2019t you just call me back\nor send me a message to fuck off? Why do you insist on being so\u2014\u201d<br/></p><!-- more --><p>Harry stops\nhimself. He considers the word on his tongue: <i>annoying.</i> She is being remarkably annoying, impossibly infuriating,\na down-right <i>burden.</i> The worst part\nof it all is that she does nothing. She ignores him and continues to live her\nown separate life, and there really isn\u2019t anything she can do to control how\nannoying she\u2019s being. In spite of this, there is a beat that his heart reserves\nfor only her.<br/></p><p>\u201cJust call\nme back. Please. Anything.\u201d<br/></p><p>By the time\nthe sixth rolls around, Harry parallels a broken record of apologies and pleas.\nHe considers, in a hopeful part of his mind, that it is her favorite one to\nplay. She does not make any attempts to throw out the vinyl that screams with\ndeep scratches, so she must enjoy the melody of his broken heart and dance in\nhis misery. As cruel as it sounds, he prefers this over the possibility that\nshe simply wishes to wear out the beloved composition until there is nothing\nleft to let go of.<br/></p><p>Chances are\nthat this is why he has not sought out the most obvious of solutions. He knows\nthe route to her apartment, he knows when she is absent and when she is at\nhome. He even knows how to sneak his way in, and though it may be a psychotically\ndrastic turn, it is such an easy game for him to play. The fifty-fifty gamble,\nhowever, is what keeps him from paying her the visit. Cornering her to make a\ndecision \u2013 to love him back or to reject his heart once again \u2013 will give him a\ndefinite answer, and for once, uncertainty is his friend. He savors these\none-sided conversations because then he can imagine her listening on the other\nend. It is better than to know for certain if she does not care for him or his\nheart. It is better to suffer through the fatal chase than to not feel the pain\nat all.<br/></p><p>As he\nboards the plane, he keeps his heart open. As he settles into his private seat,\nhe keeps her words with him. As he feels the runway disappear from beneath him,\nhe holds his phone steady in his hands, and composes his final attempt before\ndreaming in the clouds.\u00a0<br/></p><p><b><i>&gt;I understand if you don\u2019t want to talk to me</i></b></p><p><b><i>&gt;but wherever I\u2019ll be, I\u2019ll still wait for your call.</i></b></p><p><b>\u00a0</b>Months pass\nby, and Harry revolves around a vacant world. He visits countries that are rich\nwith beauty. The roads are endless in their mystical magic. He passes strangers\non his journeys, and they tell him of how happy he appears; how genuine his\nsmile perceives. They don\u2019t know that he has not spoken to y/n in months, and\nit affects his craft in both a negative and positive way. She does not consume\nhim. He devotes his entirety to her, but his life goes on without her. He is\ncapable of finding humor in small things, distracts himself with the whimsical\nwonders of the world, and spares no thought to the woman who spears his love.\u00a0</p><p>He is doing fine, and he enjoys\nhimself frequently, but there comes a moment when everything stops. His brain\npeaks at an image of her: she walks away, and it strikes a hollow spark within.\nHe laughs, he listens, he lives \u2013 at the end of the day, she is there, and the\nsullen moments of that night sneak up on him like a killer in the shadows.</p><p>Tonight, he celebrates. Despite his\nextravagant lifestyle, Harry prefers intimate get-togethers to explosive\nevents. He\u2019s not one to sell himself to the wealthiest festivities that shower\nhim in praise and flaunt his name. He doesn\u2019t need the exploitation, but\ntonight, he tries not to mind it. He steps into the empty elevator and listens\nto the doors close behind him as Jeff presses the button to the party\u2019s floor.\nWhile his friend fixes his appearance last minute in the reflective surface of\nthe elevator walls, Harry gazes at the number rising above his head.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not plannin\u2019 on staying long,\u201d\nhe says, observing his own appearance in the reflection. It is nothing too\nlavishing for a company\u2019s anniversary party, but it has enough flare to\nproperly mark it as his own style.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m there as long as you are,\u201d\nJeff responds. He releases his hands from the collar of his button-up. \u201cAre you\ngoing to head back to your hotel room?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe. Although I am in the mood\nfor anything other than late-night television.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>His friend laughs, nodding his head\nin agreement. \u201cYou\u2019re the boss. But try to not get too crazy tonight, you still\nhave emails to respond to the morning, and another meeting over Skype.\u201d</p><p>Jeff goes on with his business\ntalk, and Harry isn\u2019t too sure about whether he\u2019s grateful for this or not.\nIt\u2019s nice to indulge into a schedule for the next day, but it is also nice to\nnot worry over the chaos of his career for one night. In the interim of their\ndiscussion, the elevator dings and pauses motion. When Harry looks up, he sees\nthat there are still a few more floors to go, but the sparkling doors open, and\nthe two friends give each other a look.</p><p>A man is the first to enter. He\nshines in a flamboyantly bold outfit, one that is sure to present him with the\nattention that he desires. He flashes a charming smile, presses his palms flat\nagainst the side of the doors, and tilts his head to shout over his shoulder.\n\u201cHurry your asses up or I\u2019m going without you!\u201d</p><p>The confident man moves himself\ninto the back-right corner, with Harry and Jeff silent against the adjacent\nback wall. An exasperated \u201cMy god,\u201d breathes out from the hallway, faint\nfootsteps rush down the carpet floors. Harry takes a step forward, situating\nhimself near the keypad with a finger pushing down on the button that keeps the\ndoors open. While waiting for the next person to arrive, he takes a quick\nglance at the man in the corner and wonders where he has seen his face before.</p><p>\u201cSasha, you better be holding open\nthe doors!\u201d the woman yells, which causes the three men to chuckle with each\nother in time. Harry, however, settles down from the amusement fairly quickly\nas he peruses the familiar voice. He doesn\u2019t ponder for long, because sooner\nthan later, the mysterious woman appears by the doors and glares at her friend.\nShe opens her plump lips as if to curse at him, but notices the other two\nentities and shifts her demeanor. \u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t know\u2014\u201d</p><p>The woman pauses her sentence. She\nobserves Harry and Jeff, who she comes to realize are not mere strangers\nhitching for a ride up. Harry feels his heart drop for a short moment, his finger\nfalls from the sleek button. Her perfecting attire radiates with a dazzling\nenergy amid the dull and hazy lights, and her smile is far brighter than Harry\nrecalls last seeing.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d she exclaims. She walks over\nthe threshold, and takes a step closer to Harry with her arms outstretching for\na hug. \u201cIt\u2019s been a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSophia,\u201d Harry greets her. He\nallows her to pull him in for a reuniting embrace, patting her back in a gently\nand amiable manner. \u201cLovely to see you.\u201d</p><p>Though his voice is monotone, he is\nhonest with his words. It is a surprise to see Sophia on this strange night,\nbut she has always been a delight to him and those around her. He begins to\nfeel better about the crowd that this party will bring, but a startling notion\ntwirls in the field of his flower-mind. Sophia pulls away, delivers a\nmillion-dollar smile, and strolls over to greet Jeff, who she is also an\nacquaintance of. The elevator doors begin to push together, and Harry lets out\na sigh of relief for what he believes will be a smooth night from here on out.</p><p>\u201cWait! Sasha!\u201d someone calls out\nfrom the hallway, their footsteps patter against the carpet floors. A manicured\nhand reaches out to the narrow space left between the closing doors. Harry\u2019s\neyes bulge out of his head, but he is quick to act upon the situation unlike\nthe three mindless bystanders. He reaches out to wave his hand in front of the\ndoors while simultaneously pushing the button that keeps them open. Sasha, on\nthe other hand, stands unbothered in his corner, smart phone in hand. He looks\nup in time to see the doors opening once again, but fails to catch the\nincredulous gaze shared between two long-lost friends.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Sasha mumbles, and returns\nto his device.\u00a0</p><p>Time ticks away, and the stare\nlingers on, but Harry feels the universe falter in its continuous lifetime.\nHaving her in the flesh reminds him of his hopeless attempts, and in one frail\nsecond, their paths intersect for one painfully perfect moment. It scares him\nthen of what she will do, and in this confined box with four other people, he\nwishes to be alone. One look at her eyes \u2013 once leaking in pain; one look at\nher cheeks \u2013 once staining in melancholy tears; one look at her and he\nremembers how it had felt to see her walk away.</p><p>Despite his fears, he does not\nanticipate a smile. An authentic smile reaching to her sparkling eyes that\ndisguise behind layers of beauty products to accentuate her marvelous attire.\nEven so, there is no difference in how his eyes perceive her. Whether she is in\na glamorous element or spilling her secrets through sobs, his entire heart\nbelongs to her. His heart that fluctuates with emotions momentarily settles on\njust one. Before he can return the kind gesture, before he can exhale with\ncontent and glee, her arms pull him in by the shoulders. She wraps herself softly\naround his frame, and her scent is the most divine, but he can only bask in it\nfor a second before associating it with the torture he knows all too well.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHi, Harry,\u201d she says, and faintly\nnuzzles her chin in the crook of his neck. \u201cHaven\u2019t heard from you in a while.\u201d</p><p>Harry stiffens. Over her shoulder,\nhe can see the doors closing for a final time. He can hear the other three in\ntheir own conversation. He can feel her warm breath sending twisters down his\nspine. It is over her shoulder that the color of the world shifts to gray. She\nhas not heard from him in a while, but he calls her at least once every week.\nTry as he might, he cannot forget her, and so he reaches out with hope that\nevery call will be the one she finally answers.</p><p>Her grip eases, though Harry\u2019s arms\nhave long fallen from her waist. She pulls away, and peers up at him with\ncaution in her eyes. Her smile paints a completely different picture. \u201cHow\u2019ve\nyou been?\u201d she asks, purses her lips. Her casual behavior makes him sad, and if\nhe isn\u2019t mistaken, she looks to be begging him to stay quiet; she\u2019s begging him\nto not start something tonight that is unfinished from months ago.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d he mumbles, but the answer\ncarries more significance than he lets on. She goes to stand by Sasha, but he\nrecalls his messages; he recalls how on her end, the decline button saves her.\nThe option to mute his conversation is a gift. Clearing her voicemail box is\nlifting a weight that she had never wanted on her shoulders. Her solution is to\npretend. She does as his first voicemail had asked her and pretends that the\nsecret night of confessions had never happened. She somehow pushes that memory\naway and pretends that everything is fine in their broken friendship.</p><p>She pretends that his love does not\nexist, and that is the greatest pain of all.\u00a0</p><p>The ride up the remaining floors is\nuncomfortable for him, especially when he realizes that the trio are going to\nthe same party that he is. Where Jeff mingles in a short conversation with\nSophia and Sasha \u2013 who Harry now remembers seeing in one of y/n\u2019s Instagram\nposts \u2013 the younger man stands in his isolation by the keypad. He starts to\ndoubt that she is in love with him too. He wishes for her to spare him a\nglance; he wants to see the weakness in her frown. He cannot fathom how it is\npossible to stay away from the person that has one\u2019s heart, or even act as\nthough they barely exist. If he is to see that weakness, that pouty little\nexpression, <i>then</i> he will know if she\ntruly loves him too.</p><p>It feels like lifetimes before the\nelevator doors open to a floor that drowns in music. Sasha is the first of the\ntrio to step out, sashaying as he opens up Snapchat on his phone with a single\nhand. Harry reminisces a time when his younger self had grown fond of Twitter.\nWith a harsh push under the spotlight, he\u2019s since then snapped out of the\nsocial network daze and has learned a great deal of restraint. It is that\nrestraint that has kept him from checking up on y/n\u2019s profiles in those lonely\nfew months, but he wonders if he had taken the chance to peak, would he have\nknown about her appearance tonight?</p><p>\u201cNice catching up, Jeff,\u201d Sophia\nsays. She links her arm with y/n\u2019s, helping her friend out the elevator since\nshe can\u2019t find it within herself to look up. As they pass by Harry, Sophia\nturns her head and sends him a nod and a smirk, which is far more attention\nthan y/n has given him in the past few months.</p><p>Harry smiles politely and allows\nthe two women to scurry away before trailing far behind them. He steps out onto\nthe floor, Jeff right on his tail, and the sea of beautiful faces begin to gawk\nat the legend before them. \u201cDid you know that y/n would be here?\u201d Harry asks, aware\nthat the madness will soon mask his voice.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Jeff answers, but tilts his\nhead at the question. \u201cI figured between the two of us, you would have been the\none to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike she said,\u201d Harry replies,\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a while.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>After the so-called falling out,\nHarry had refused to talk about it with anyone. It isn\u2019t as if what had\nhappened embarrasses him, or that he falls in line with the other men who find\nit <i>un-masculine</i> to speak openly about\ntheir feelings. He doesn\u2019t associate expressing emotions to be masculine or\nfeminine; it is a human quality, a necessity and a treasure. The situation is\njust far too delicate for him. Y/n is a fragment belonging to a rare batch of\npeople that he trusts; the world is sometimes so cruel and unkind, and y/n is\nthe uniqueness that makes it worthwhile. Above anything, she is his friend, and\nhe will suffer through that title than to not have her at all. The only person\nthat he tells this to, is his mother.</p><p>\u201cI figured Sophia would be here,\u201d\nJeff says as they near the room that hosts the party. Harry gives him a\nquizzical look, silent for an explanation. \u201cShe endorses a lot of companies on\nher Instagram. This is like a party and a business deal for her.\u201d</p><p>Of course. This new generation of\nnetworking supports a numerous amount of careers, ones that cannot exist\nwithout the thing he avoids the most. Sophia has an impressive following, so it\nmakes sense for her to be an attendee at this precious little soiree. With her\nand y/n practically attached at the hip, Harry understands how y/n manages to\nstick herself in a strange combination of people. She herself views her life as\nsimilar as the next average human being struggling for survival. She is a\nperson who shops in the sale section, dines at McDonald\u2019s, and pays her rent\nlate every now and then; the lavishing lifestyle is not her safe space.</p><p>Even so, she takes part in an\ninteresting act. Her compliance to a night full of hype and hysteria, flashing\ncameras and mindful eyes \u2013 it is not who she is, but she portrays the role very\nwell. She walks into the party, grinning at the other guests, though Harry has\na deep instinctive feeling that she now wants nothing more than to go back\nhome.</p><p>An hour passes and Harry has\nsuccessfully mingled with his friends, even going so far as to indulge in\nentertaining conversations with new faces. He doesn\u2019t know it until he is\ndowning his third glass, but the tequila has been rather inviting. He should\ndetest the burning taste; it is partially to blame for his impulsion on <i>that</i> night, and the voicemail that had\nled him to a slippery slope of solitude. So <i>damn\nthe tequila</i>, he says to himself, glaring at the innocent drink, but <i>damn,</i> the tequila resembles a craving\nthat he has been missing. It feels so strangely smooth running down his pretty\nthroat, and he feels it electrifying his veins.\u00a0</p><p>Another hour passes. He giggles\nmore often than usual. People come up to him to take pictures \u2013 praising him\nand flaunting his name \u2013 and he sticks his wild tongue out in almost all of\nthem. He grows affectionate and clings to his friends, but <i>only</i> his friends. He cannot find the person that he really wants to\ncuddle. He\u2019s not even sure if she\u2019s still at the party, but frankly, he doesn\u2019t\ncare. This is his night, and he wants to spend it in a hazy cloud of illusions,\ndrowning in the purple lights and blaring music.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d Jeff tugs at his shoulder.\nHarry sits on a stool in front of the bar, and his friend swivels his chair in\nhis direction. His sudden contact startles Harry, but he relaxes when he sees\nthe face of a man he heavily relies on. \u201cAre you ready to go?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Harry smiles. His lips fold tightly\ntogether, his flush face exposing his current state of mind. \u201cNot yet.\u201d He\nshakes his head. He swivels his chair back to the front, calls the bartender\nover so that he can order him and his bestest best friend \u2013 <i>don\u2019t tell Mitch </i>\u2013 a persuasive shot.</p><p>\u201cNot for me,\u201d Jeff declines, waving\nhis hand horizontally in a slicing motion across his throat. \u201cAnd honestly, you\nshould consider holding back too.\u201d</p><p>Harry can barely hear his voice\nover the music and overlapping conversations. Still, he makes out the general\ndetails, and something about his words have Harry gushing at his friend. He\ngrins up at him, dimples and all, and guides his heavy arms over Jeff\u2019s\nshoulders. \u201cAh, you\u2019re so caring, you little\u2014\u201d Harry finishes his sentence with\na growl, attacking his friend\u2019s closest cheek by taking a playful bite between\nhis pearly teeth. \u201cVery caring, you are. I\u2019m fine, I swear. I\u2019m having a good\ntime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes! It\u2019s a party, Jeffery! Go out\nand enjoy yourself.\u201d</p><p>Despite his encouragement, Jeff\ntakes a seat on the stool next to Harry and keeps him company. He stays for his\nfriend, who he knows is a bit of an impulsive drunk, and also someone that\nrelishes in camaraderie. It is also more challenging, Jeff says, for the pesky\nstrangers and tag-alongs to come up to Harry when he is already in a private conversation\nwith his manager. Therefore, the friends talk, and they laugh, and one has to\nkeep the other from losing all of his brain cells. It is a nice pattern that\nensues for half an hour until Jeff announces that he needs to use the restroom.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be right back,\u201d he says into\nHarry\u2019s ear, two hands pat his shoulders before he is off on his quest. While\nhe has fair intentions, Harry knows that he will not <i>be right back.</i> He will spend some time actually looking for the\ntoilets, squirm through tightly packed bodies both stationary and in rhythmic\nmotion. At an event like this, there is also surely to be a line. Then to\nsquirm his way back \u2013 it will be some time before he returns, which means that\nfor some time, Harry will be alone. Right now, Harry alone is a very dangerous\ncircumstance.</p><p>His first mistake is to order\nanother shot. A shot of what exactly, he\u2019s not too sure, but if it\u2019s the damned\ntequila then his mistake is much graver than he anticipates. His second mistake\nis to notice the hard, solid item in the back pocket of his trousers. It starts\nto bother him, especially with the seating position that he is in. He pulls the\ndevice out, and glares at how comfortably it fits in his right hand. His third\nmistake \u2013 oh, he certainty fears his third. A devious and curious thought\nflashes with warning, but before he can stop himself, he unlocks his phone and\npulls up the Instagram app. Notifications begin to pop up as they normally do,\nand sometimes it is difficult to wrap his head around the large numbers.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t go on now to gawk at the\nnumbers or scroll through his feed. He taps on the search bar, thumbs hesitant\nfor a second before typing away at the keyboard until her familiar handle\nappears. It has been months since he\u2019s seen her profile, even before his visit\nto her apartment. Her biography is simple and sweet, her profile photo is a\ntrue depiction of who she is. Her posts are a combination of snapshots, from\nmirror selfies to remarkable scenery to fun nights to memes, memes, and memes.\nAll of it is boldly her, but her most recent post captivates his attention.\u00a0</p><p>He clicks on the slightly edited\npicture to enlarge the two women who pose together. Taken from the waist up,\nthe duo flashes similar seductive expressions at the camera. Sophia\u2019s body faces\nforward, her head tilts to accentuate her jawline, and a wine glass hangs from\nher fingertips. Y/n positions herself sideways, her back presses against\nSophia\u2019s arm, and her head aligns to her propped shoulder. Her features are\npudgier than Sophia\u2019s, her face not as defined, and her attire much less\nluxurious. To him, she glows amid the bustling bodies frozen in the background\nof their moment.</p><p>Her caption consists of a few\nplayful emoji\u2019s, another thing he isn\u2019t too fond of, but their innocence and liveliness\nin graphic and color makes him smile. If he remembers correctly, she doesn\u2019t\nmiss an opportunity to insert a clever caption, so he can imagine her\nfrustration at this party. He envisions her picking at her brain for the least\nbit of intellect left, cursing at people\u2019s buffoonery and celebration, but\nultimately deciding on the series of vague emoji\u2019s. She posts it an hour ago,\nominous without a location tag as the background does not give too much away.\nHe doesn\u2019t know if this means that she still breathes in the festivities or if\nit is her goodnight to the world before she hops on her flight back home.</p><p>\u201cHaving a good time?\u201d a loud voice\nshouts into ear, grips his left shoulder, and lets their hand hang from the\nfirm crevice of his warm neck.</p><p>Harry nearly drops his phone\nface-down on the wet laminate surface of the bar. His heart races as he makes a\nquick and sly move to lock his phone, the screen turns black mid-jolt of surprise.\nHe swerves to his right side to meet with his intruder, and discovers a pair of\nrecognizable piercing eyes. They\u2019re cordial in their own sense, but the\nintimidation that laces somewhere beneath her irises is unmistakable. He\nresponds to her with a polite smile and nonchalant nod, which for her is enough\nof an invitation to pull up the empty stool next to him and stay. His attention\ndoesn\u2019t remain on her for too long, because after he acknowledges her presence,\nhe faces forward again with the desire to submerge himself in another drink.</p><p>\u201cIt was a struggle to get to you,\u201d\nSophia remarks, one pant-clad leg crosses over the other. A manicured hand\nwhirls in the storm of her luscious locks, and her stilettos droop from the\nfirm shape of her feet with only a mere strap keeping them intact. \u201cI had a\ntussle with about three other people to get here.\u201d</p><p>At this, Harry laughs. His\nshoulders shake, his eyes squint, and his tiny tongue sticks out between his\nteeth. \u201cI\u2019m sure you really ruffed them up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah.\u201d Sophia smiles. \u201cYou sure\nare loved.\u201d</p><p>She means it endearingly \u2013 not in\nthe kiss-ass manner that many people do to him tonight, but with fair\nintentions of bringing comfort to an otherwise lonesome man. Either way, Harry\ndelivers a sad smile to the tabletop. His hands fidget with each other, and\nthen gravitates another one of his ordered drinks to him. He spins the glass\nwith his calloused fingers, watches the liquid slosh around in its crystalline\nconfinement.</p><p> \u201cNot by everyone,\u201d he says, clutches his\nglass, and raises it to his pink and swollen lips. He tilts his head back, downing\nthe contents as his eyes flutter shut. Sophia is in his peripheral vision, and\nshe watches him with a sincere, sympathetic look. Such a pity party he is, and\nit is usually at this low point that he decides to call it a night, rest his\nintoxicating thoughts, and suffer with vile regret in the late morning.</p><p>What stops\nhim tonight is Sophia\u2019s sweet and simple look that informs him of a simple\ntruth: she knows. No matter how much she succeeds in ignoring his texts, and\nhis calls, and his voicemails, y/n\u2019s tongue speaks his name after that final\ngoodnight. It contorts and curls and flattens with an elaboration of their card\ngame with a twist, and perhaps even licks away at the salty sensation of her\nrecollection. He\u2019s suspicious to the idea that perhaps this isn\u2019t as easy for\nher as he believes. She cannot push his memory beyond existence until it is\nnothing but a ghost filling her lungs with smoke; she suffers just as he does.<br/></p><p>\u201cDoes she\ntalk about me?\u201d Harry wonders aloud, sets his glass down with a harsh <i>clink!</i> He turns to Sophia, who already\nhas an impressively fierce look in her eyes, one eyebrow creating an arch to\ncompete against his inquiry.<br/></p><p>\u201cWho does?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cRight,\nlet\u2019s skip the part where you pretend that y/n hasn\u2019t told you.\u201d<br/></p><p>Sophia\ndoesn\u2019t waver. She narrows her eyes, a test to Harry to see how long she can\ndrag out her charade. It is an intense stare-down on her end, but the charming\nman does not give into her antics. His face sags, not necessarily into a frown,\nbut rather a worn-out mien that has been through a fair share of\ndisappointment.<br/></p><p>He wins at\nher sigh of defeat, the pout in her lips replacing her once confident\nimpression. To say the least, his reward is not rewarding. \u201cNot really,\u201d Sophia\nhesitantly answers, \u201cbut she wants to! I think. At least for your sake, I hope\nshe does.\u201d<br/></p><p>Harry\nscoffs, but nods his head repetitively to sink down the information that cannot\nprocess with the empty glass he holds. He knows what she refers to when she\nsays for <i>his</i> sake: he is a complete\nmess without her, barely subdues his sorrows with his need for poison, fails to\nforget her. She cannot be more wrong. He doesn\u2019t need her. His life in the past\ncouple of months have flown with ease, with happiness and health. If anything,\nhis lack of communication with her distracts him less from the truest and most\nhonest love of his life: his music. Y/n does not meet the criteria that is\nnecessary for his complex existence. He does not need her.</p><p>\u201cSo, she\u2019s\nblocking me out,\u201d Harry concludes, blinks away the dizziness and polychromatic\ndots that float across his vision like butterflies. He knows that she\u2019s been\nignoring him, that much is obvious \u2013 but to block him out? To hide him away in\na place of her confusing brain that she cannot possibly reach? That is nearly\nimpossible.<br/></p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s\ngoing on with her life. I think maybe you should consider doing that too.\u201d<br/></p><p>Harry sends\nher an incredulous look. \u201cMe? What do you think I\u2019ve been doing? Sitting around\nhere, waiting for her call?\u201d<br/></p><p>Sophia\nreplies with a mocking expression. It is enough for him to recall the last\nvoicemail he had sent before boarding the plane to a new life without her.<br/></p><p>\u201cJesus,\u201d\nHarry grumbles. \u201cSo much for not talking about me.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cHarry,\nplease. I\u2019m not here to be hostile.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cEnlighten\nme then, Soph. After all, you did tussle with three other people to get here.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a\nclass act, Styles.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cDid she\nsend you or something? To tell me to piss off?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cNo! If she\nwanted you to piss off, she would tell you herself.\u201d<br/></p><p>Harry stays\nsilent, as silent as he can possibly be in this bizarre setting. He fixes his\nattention on Sophia, who has caution in her eyes, similar to a child caught\nwith their hand in the cookie jar. He searches her intensely, wonders if he\nhears her correctly, or if his surmise is far off from what she really means.\n\u201cWhy doesn\u2019t she then?\u201d he asks, the words play over like a tragic symphony. He\npleas for an answer, almost whining with child-like eyes glassing over with\npure innocence.<br/></p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t\nanswer that for her,\u201d Sophia says, \u201cbut as her friend, I can tell you what I\nthink she deserves.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cIs it me?\u201d<br/></p><p>Sophia\npurses her lips, spreads the smooth lipstick over her plump lips. \u201cIt\u2019s not\nthis,\u201d she answers, a hint in her determined voice feeling bad for him. \u201cWhatever\n<i>this</i> actually is. A back-and-forth.\nYou call her, she ignores you. It\u2019s taking a toll on her having to deal with\nthis every week, same as it did that night. I\u2019m not saying that y/n is innocent\nin this, because clearly, she\u2019s not, but she has her reasons. You need to respect\nthem.\u201d<br/></p><p>Harry wants\nto cry. He wants to release everything that y/n stores in him: the rage, the\nmourning, the self-pity, the love. The endless, endless love that he doesn\u2019t\never imagine he can have for someone in this whirlwind of a lifetime. It\u2019s become\ntoo much, but he still doesn\u2019t understand how it has come to this. What are her\nreasons? What compels her to stay away from something that can be so bloody\nbrilliant?<br/></p><p>\u201cShe\ndoesn\u2019t need to love someone that worries her all the time,\u201d Sophia continues.\nThe heedful filter inside of her runs out, her words confirming to him the\ntruths he\u2019s always known. If she is to do anything for her friend, it is this.\n\u201cShe needs someone who\u2019s there, Harry. I know you want to be, but have you ever\nstopped to consider her side of things?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he\nanswers instantly, breathing out through his mouth. He blinks sluggishly, a\nstrange effect taking over. \u201cShe\u2019s &hellip; she can be&hellip;\u201d<br/></p><p>Sophia\nwaits for an answer that doesn\u2019t appear. \u201cShe can be a what?\u201d<br/></p><p><i>Loved.</i> She can be loved by anyone, and\nanyone who is lucky enough to make her heart happy should be enough for him.\nBut it isn\u2019t. It isn\u2019t, because he is selfish, and he loves her too much to let\nthis be the end of it. She can be loved by anyone, but she will find something\neternal that is worth the heartache if she is to be loved by him.<br/></p><p>\u201cShe can be\nwith me,\u201d Harry slurs, a hiccup raking through his body. He looks pathetic, he\nknows he does, but none of it matters. Whatever happens tomorrow doesn\u2019t matter\nif tonight means nothing.<br/></p><p>Sophia\nshakes her head. She uncrosses a leg and stretches it out onto the sweaty\ndancefloor. She adjusts her outfit, rakes a hand through her hair, and points a\nlazy finger at Harry. \u201cThat is not for you to decide,\u201d she tells him, and\nshakes her head again as a proper farewell. Her legs only carry her so far\nbefore Harry\u2019s calling back at her.<br/></p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d he\nshouts, audible to her, but deaf to the drunks surrounding them. Sophia whirls\naround, stands tall in her place as bodies mistakenly push into her. \u201cThis\nisn\u2019t for <i>you</i> to decide! I\u2019m sorry,\nSophia, but this concerns me and this concerns y/n. <i>No </i>one else.\u201d Harry stands to his feet, the glass in his hands serving\nno purpose but to fuel his veins prior to his assertive nature taking over. He\nrotates his head in every direction, moving mindlessly through the storming\ncrowd as Sophia begins to hold him back.<br/></p><p>\u201cWhat are\nyou\u2014\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cWhere is\nshe?\u201d he demands, swivels his way around her as he would with a pesky tree in\nhis path. \u201cWe need to talk.\u201d<br/></p><p><i>\u201cNo!\u201d</i> Sophia reprimands, using all of\nher might to pull him back by the eager arm. She leans back on her stilettos,\nbut he practically drags her across the floor. To any onlooker, the interaction\nappears as harmless as two friends having a playful laugh. \u201cNo, you are not!\nDon\u2019t even think about it, fucker!\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cFoul\nmouth, Sophia.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t\na game! You can\u2019t just press pause and resume as if it doesn\u2019t affect anyone\nelse! Think about <i>her</i> for once!\u201d</p><p>Harry comes\nto a halt. Sophia\u2019s body rams into his back, she huffs but refuses to let go of\nher hold on his arm. She doesn\u2019t strike a chord in him with her words, nor does\nshe persuade him to back off. In reality, the world around him comes to a stop.\nNo one else matters, whether they are gawking at him or serving him no\nattention. She stands there, in the midst of all the chaos, and her universe\ncollides with his for a single, mere moment. She gapes at him, and her limbs\nfreeze, and whatever Sasha is yelling into one ear goes out the other. He is\ndeaf to the music, blind to the lights, and he cannot feel anything but the\nbeat of his aching heart.<br/></p><p>\u201cI think\nabout her all the time,\u201d he says in a hushed tone, a mantra that he recites,\nassuring him of his affection. No one else hears his special words, but maybe\ny/n focuses on him long enough to read his quivering lips. He does not know; she\nis a statue in her own world, a piece of art that he admires and displays to\nthe mass for all of her beauties, but at the end of the day, she is his. She is\na separate entity of pure magic, but she belongs to him, and he gives up\neverything to have her.<br/></p><p>Harry\ncontinues his walk, which worries Sophia as she starts tugging him back again.\nThe closer he gets to y/n, the more his stomach squirms and twists and flips.\nHe does, however, find ease in slipping through the crowd; it feels as if they\npart for him, relishing in the cinematic moment that is to take place with a\nfew more meager steps. When he does eventually reach her, he finds himself\nfrowning, because she cannot bear to look him in the eyes. She searches the\nrumbling floor, closing in on herself as if to disappear.<br/></p><p>\u201cI miss\nyou,\u201d Harry says, and he somehow finds the strength to overpower the music that\nis disparate to this specific point in time. \u201cLook at me,\u201d he demands of her,\nbut dares not to touch her fragile cocoon. \u201cY/n, please.\u201d His voice wavers,\nweak and damaged, reaching out to her even if she does not want him to.<br/></p><p>Sasha darts\nhis eyes between the two friends, or lovers \u2013 he\u2019s not quite sure. \u201cWhat\u2019s\ngoing on?\u201d he asks, oblivious to y/n\u2019s lack of comfort, and the manner in which\nher systems fail to save her. She feels the familiar burn in her nose,\nremembers the last time Harry had begun a sentence with <i>I</i> and had ended it with <i>you.</i>\nIt hits her in a single slap of a moment, time quite irrelevant as the tears\nstart to break apart from her soft eyes.<br/></p><p>She can\u2019t be here, so she does the\nlittle something that he haunts himself with every day, and the image of her\nwalking away for a second time has his knees growing weak, almost failing to\nsupport the gravity of her response. Yet, he keeps his ground. He watches the\nlittle shake of her head, though he doesn\u2019t know how she can disagree with his\ncertainty, and watches her legs carry her to the hallway outside of the party.\nIt is only this time that he refuses to let her go; he refuses to stand by and\nfeel sorry for himself, left to wonder where it had all gone wrong.</p><p>He follows\nher out; the yellow lights of the hallway and the sudden expanse of vacancy\ncauses a disturbance to his movements. He feels as if he is floating in\nmid-air, swimming to her, who is an albatross flying miles and miles above him.\n\u201cStop!\u201d he calls out, and the few who meander outside of the party turn their\nheads to find the source of outburst.<br/></p><p>She doesn\u2019t\nstop, but he can see the flinch in her body at his command. Her legs carry her\nas fast as they are able to in the elevated footwear she sports, jewelry\njingling against each other, footsteps scrapping against the carpet floors. He\nhas no choice but to accelerate onward, using his advantage of comfortable\nshoes to match her speed until he surpasses her in the chase, turns on his\nheels, and blocks her open-ended path.<br/></p><p>His words\nspeed out from his tongue, \u201cstop, stop, stop!\u201d His hands are on her shoulders\nnow, covered in the softest cloth he\u2019s ever known. \u201cIf you could please just\nstop and listen and talk to me\u2014\u201d<br/></p><p><i>\u201cNo,\u201d</i> she croaks out, still rebuffing\nany eye-contact. Her arms poke out, pushing him away, but he is firm in his\nplace. With a final attempt, she musters up her remnants of energy and gives\nhim a solid shove, a forceful one that pushes her back from him until a space\nopens up between them.</p><p>Harry gapes\nat her. His eyebrows knit in shock, his mouth ajar as the words are suddenly\nlost. She stands in front of him with dejection pouring down and outlining the\nshape of her shrunken face. There is still no eye contact between them, but y/n\nfinally does not walk away. Her breaths are ragged, the walls feel as though\nthey\u2019re closing in. She nibbles on the inside of her cheek, and nervously\nwiggles her fingers down by her side.<br/></p><p>\u201cWhy are\nyou doin\u2019 this?\u201d he asks, hands prop on his hips. He has to know. If all else\ngoes wrong, if it really is the end, then he has to know why.<br/></p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t\nwant to do this right now.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cAlright,\nthen when? Because you certainly didn\u2019t want to talk about it two months ago,\nor any time I tried to reach you thereafter. Not even a descent message to let\nme know if you were even okay.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cMaybe\nbecause it wasn\u2019t any of your business!\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cThe hell it\nisn\u2019t! Tell me how you could be so stubborn to think that? Tell me how it\ndoesn\u2019t concern me at all\u2014\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cBecause\nthere is no <i>it</i>, Harry!\u201d y/n seethes,\nand lets out a teary scoff. \u201cThere is no <i>it</i>\nthat we have to talk about. It\u2019s not \u2013 it doesn\u2019t&hellip;\u201d She doesn\u2019t notice it,\nbut she\u2019s practically in his face now. Looking into his eyes, the glimmer that\nshe admires is gone. She exhales a sigh, and lets her frustration simmer down\nbefore finishing her thought. \u201cIt\u2019s not there. It never had been.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not\ntrue,\u201d Harry disagrees, quick with the shake of his head. \u201cPlease, y/n, after\nall of this, you should know that\u2019s not true.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not in\nlove\u2014\u201d<br/></p><p><i>\u201cDon\u2019t.</i>\u201d Harry leans in closer and\nwhispers. \u201cDon\u2019t try to push me away. You know there\u2019s something there because\neven if you feel nothing for me, even if it\u2019s only me and I\u2019m an idiot to be in\nlove with someone that doesn\u2019t love me back, it\u2019s still true. I\u2019m in love with\nyou, and that\u2019s still something.\u201d<br/></p><p>With his\nhead tilting down to confess in her ear, y/n\u2019s eyes focus on the rolls of his\nneck to which a silver chain kisses and a blanket of warm skin hugs. It is so\neasy to fall into his words. So easy to bury herself in his embrace, to feel\nthe electric pull of his entire being. So, so easy.<br/></p><p>\u201cSo, tell\nme again,\u201d he says, a soothing turn to the treacherous ambience that bubbles\nthem in, away from the world outside. \u201cTell me that you\u2019re not in love with me,\nbut don\u2019t try to tell me how I feel about you. Because it\u2019s always been you,\ny/n.\u201d<br/></p><p>Y/n\u2019s lips\nwrinkle, a prominent pout that portrays the weakness he had once wanted to see.\nNow that his eyes sparkle over them so clearly, he wants nothing more than to\nwash her fragility away. \u201cNot always,\u201d she mumbles, her mouth moving to the\nside of her face. In consequence of that forms a smile, but there is nothing\nhumorous in the gesture. It\u2019s sad, frightfully so, as if she sees herself as\nnothing but a joke. \u201cIt\u2019s always been someone else. You know that. Even if in\nthe back of your mind you were thinking of me, you were with someone else. You\nmight think that everything you\u2019re saying is true, but I was never entirely\nyours. I knew that from the start.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cNo,\nthat\u2019s&hellip;\u201d Harry shakes his head. He makes a bold decision to reach a single\nhand up \u2013 the left one, with his inked cross swaying back and forth to the\ncalming rhythm that she admires \u2013 and cups the side of her face in a graceful\nmanner. His touch hovers over her wet skin, and it hurts to know that it is his\ndoing. \u201cThat\u2019s entirely different, y/n.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cMaybe for\nyou.\u201d She shrugs. \u201cBut not to me. Not in my eyes.\u201d<br/></p><p>What can he\nsay? It isn\u2019t as if he can convince her that her perspective is otherwise \u2013 he\nhas to validate these feelings. He has to understand her reasoning, or else he\nis right back where he had started.<br/></p><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d\nHe nods, caressing a single thumb over her cheek. He savors the moment; the\nscent that he inhales is intoxicatingly addictive. He doesn\u2019t know when it will\nend, or when will be the last time he can breathe her in like this, so close\ntogether. \u201cI can\u2019t change that. I can\u2019t change how you viewed everything, and\nit\u2019s my fault that you even had to see it that way at all. I\u2019m to blame, and I\nknow that.\u201d<br/></p><p>Y/n shakes\nher head. \u201cIt\u2019s not about pointing fingers, Harry.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cI know. I\nknow it\u2019s not, but it\u2019s a start.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA start to\nwhat?\u201d y/n asks exasperatedly. She searches for something in him, but he\u2019s not\nsure of what exactly. An answer? A defeat? A silence that cannot possibly solve\nany of her inquiries and fears?<br/></p><p>\u201cA start to\nwhatever the hell this is,\u201d Harry answers without a stutter in his voice. \u201cMe\nfiguring out how to prove to you that it <i>has</i>\nalways been you, and how I fear that it always <i>will </i>be you. That\u2019s not healthy, y/n, in a world of billions and\nonly being moved by one. If I have to spend the rest of my life proving myself\nto you, I won\u2019t hesitate to do it. Even if you don\u2019t want me, which I\u2019m sorry\nto say, but I\u2019m pretty sure we\u2019ve already found out is not the case.\u201d<br/></p><p>Y/n softly chuckles, and it is\nthen he notices that her tears no longer flow. It is progress, and it has been\na struggle to get here. \u201cYou won\u2019t be able to,\u201d she says. \u201cI know my worth, but\nthat doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t tear myself apart sometimes. <i>You</i> don\u2019t make that any easier and the worst part is that it\u2019s not\neven your fault. You can\u2019t stop the rest of the world from loving you, so <i>I\u2019m</i> sorry to say that you won\u2019t be able\nto convince me of anything otherwise.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cI beg to\ndiffer.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t\ncare.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t\nI just try?\u201d he asks, and this time his other hand follows. He has her entire\nface in his hold, and she looks so precious standing here, her faces squishes,\nher pouty but kissable lips. \u201cYou say that I don\u2019t make it easier, but you\nhaven\u2019t even tried to see if maybe it\u2019s not as hard as you think.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cBecause I\nknow myself better than anyone, Harry. Sometimes, I even know you better than\nyou know yourself. I envision your future and how everything will turn out, and\nI worry over things that don\u2019t even concern me. I live your life in ways that\nyou haven\u2019t even dreamed about and I understand your little catchphrases and\nyour antics. I do it all for you, because someone has to, and I don\u2019t know why\nit has to be, but it is. I do that for you, so pardon me if I already have an\nidea of how hellish this could turn out.\u201d<br/></p><p>When y/n\nlooks up at Harry, she sees a wavering light that flickers with stardust. His\nuniverse has never looked lovelier, but it also has a strangeness to it that\nshe is not familiar with. Her little rant ends on a negative note, so she\ndoesn\u2019t know why he stares at her as though she is the first existence he has\never known.<br/></p><p>\u201cGod, I\u2019m\nso in love with you,\u201d He declares, and he doesn\u2019t give her any time to process\nbefore he has his mouth over hers. It is inviting, to feel the shape that fits\nso well with his. <i>This</i> is the crave\nthat he has been missing, this sudden wild flare of emotions, and though it is\nnot perfect, it is more than enough for him.<br/></p><p>Y/n mumbles\nagainst his lips, though he doesn\u2019t miss the fact that she pulls him in as much\nhe does to her. Her hand has found his waist, but her pesky lips keep mumbling,\nbreaking apart the contact that he wishes to endure for the rest of his life.\n\u201cNo, this is a bad idea,\u201d she speaks into his lips, the same hand on his waist\nnow faintly pushing him away.<br/></p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s\nnot,\u201d he kisses back.<br/></p><p>\u201cMm-mmm.\u201d\ny/n shakes her head. Their lips pull away, and when they do, she notices the\ntransfer of her lipstick onto his mouth. \u201cThis is,\u201d she pauses, and lets out a\nlaughing huff, \u201cthis is not going to work out at all.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cWhy do you\nkeep saying that?\u201d he asks, his hands travel down to her shoulders. He rubs\nagainst them, then slithers his way down to her upper back. It is much harder\nfor her to escape him now. \u201cWhy can\u2019t you allow yourself this? You daydream\nabout the future but none of it matters because try as you might, you\u2019ll never\nreally know how amazing this can be.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cIt can\u2019t\nbe so amazing.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cWhy bloody\nnot?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cBecause\nyou said so yourself!\u201d she exclaims, and he opens his mouth to retaliate, but\nshe beats him to the mark. \u201cYou might not have said it exactly, but you definitely\nsaid it. You said that this is your life and you can\u2019t slow down and that it\u2019s\ndifferent for you! As far as I\u2019m concerned, that doesn\u2019t sound so amazing. You\u2019re\nin the clouds now, Harry, and you\u2019re going to reach galaxies you\u2019ve never even\nimagined. From down on the ground, it looks like you\u2019re never going to stop,\nand you won\u2019t. You can\u2019t. Not even for the person that you\u2019re in love with.\u201d<br/></p><p>Her words\nare fairly blunt, but Harry recalls their conversation. His single confession\nto her only play of a wild card, a distant memory that can properly place\nitself into another dimension. That night, they had not been happy. They had\nbeen foolish, going about the situation in all the wrong ways, because the\nsilence has never been their friend. Between them, there is never an absence,\nnever a stillness in the air. It has always been just them, the way they\ninteract with each other, whether it is a surplus of verbal words or\nconversations through their looks and gestures. They had been missing that\ntreasure on that cursed night, and neither of them were attentive enough to\nrealize it.<br/></p><p>Harry\nsmiles at her. His dimple is prominent, and she has to keep herself from\nswooning at the close sight of it. \u201cYou don\u2019t know,\u201d he says, joy laces in his\ntone. She tilts her head in a quizzical manner: <i>know what?</i> she asks with her stare, the silence never prevailing. \u201cYou\ndon\u2019t know how everything looks like through my eyes. When I see you, and the\nworld gets hazy, and I can\u2019t hear or feel anything. My heart turns into\nsomething else, something I can\u2019t explain. I don\u2019t understand how when I\u2019m with\nyou, time just &hellip; stops. Everything stops for you.\u201d<br/></p><p>Harry pulls\nher in slowly, their foreheads brushing as their noses crinkle against each\nother. \u201cI promise,\u201d he whispers, nudging at her so that she can welcome her\nsweet lips to his. \u201cEverything stops for you,\u201d he repeats, and connects their\nlips for a third time, and each one holds something different, something unexplainably\nspecial. He wants to say more, to further prove himself, and prove how well\ntheir love can be. He can\u2019t though, because her lips press against his, her\nhands wrap around him, and she lets herself fall in love with everything he is\nand everything he has to give.<br/></p><p>After a\nshort lip-locking moment \u2013 where not much privacy ensues, and he tries not to\nmind whatever pictures surface the next morning \u2013 their movements become a\nlittle sloppier, and Harry has the devilish urge to bite on her swollen lip. He\npulls at it between his cheeky grin, which gets a grimacing smile out of her as\nthey separate. He can\u2019t control the flutter of laughter that escapes him,\nattacking her with a chaste kiss on her cheek before whispering in her ear. \u201cHey,\nif you\u2019re up for it, we can try out that kink of yours now.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cUgh.\u201d Y/n\nrolls her eyes, then reaches up to twist his nipple through his button-up. \u201cSuch\na gentleman you are.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cOw!\u201d he\nyelps, giggling as he palms at the sensitive area. \u201cYou didn\u2019t tell me that was\npart of it, cheeky lovie!\u201d</p>",

He does not register the silence until it\nsubmerges the entire apartment. His ears strain to catch even the faintest\nsound on the other side of the door. The painted walls muffle her movements;\nnot a single light shines from the crack at his feet.</p>\n<p>The poor\nman is a blossoming flower; petals of sweetness expand from the force of\nnature&rsquo;s love. He is powerful, but the dirt pulls him to the ground with its\nmuddy hands, and steadies him for the hurricane that is to strike. He cannot\nmove. He stands and relives the events that baffle his brain: she walks away;\nshe dismisses him with a fragile goodnight, a farewell that he fears will be\nthe last; he confesses his secrets and she scrambles with strange abandonment.\nOver a dozen times does he relive those taunting moments, seconds ticking\nfurther and further away.</p>\n<p>This\ndoesn&rsquo;t make the least bit of sense to him. He can imagine it from his\nperspective without strife. He professes his love, and it unveils a grand twist\nto their years-long story. He can taste the sorrow on her lips, a mixture of\nsalt and relief. He can feel the dip in her neck where his eager hands find a\nhome, fingertips pressing with a passion. He can imagine her sweet lips to\nconfess the eight letters that welcome heaven to his heart. When he opens his\neyes, he stares at an empty wall instead. Her presence lingers, but she is not\nhere.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Harry\ndoesn&rsquo;t make a sound. He doesn&rsquo;t know if she sleeps tenderly under the comfort\nof her sheets &ndash; if exhaustion makes it that much easier for her to rest. He\ndoes not pick apart his brain to imagine, because to imagine her all snug in\nhis shaded arms is too much to bear. Consequently, with the last ounce of\nenergy that he has left, he shakes the desire from his clouded mind, and walks\naway.</p>\n<p><b><i>&gt;Can you please call me back?</i></b><b><i>&nbsp;</i></b></p>\n<p><b><i>&gt;I&rsquo;m sorry if I was pressuring you.

Can we please talk before then?</i></b></p>\n<p>Messages\nslither their way into Harry&rsquo;s everyday routine. Unanswered calls are a given, and\nhis desperate voicemails are almost therapeutic. His time ticks away, and it\nfills with him an anxiety that no crowd can ever compare with. In the days that\nfollow, he succumbs to self-hatred. He will never forgive himself for ruining\nsomething so special. A fresh sheet once written with loving memories is\nnothing but a smudge of ink, a ball that he crumples with his own bare hands.\nThe wrinkles and creases can never return to their former smooth state,\neternally marking his selfish behavior in the folded lines.</p>\n<p>Four days\ncome and go. He goes longer periods of time without communicating with y/n, but\nthis particular situation has his head spinning off and into the clouds. She\nhas yet to call him back, and he will have to leave soon. His career requires\nhis attention elsewhere, in places that y/n cannot go. Somewhere in his mind,\nhe wonders if that is her plan. Does she count the days, waiting for him to\ndisappear so that <i>finally</i> she can\ntoo?<br></p>\n<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;\nHarry asks her. His legs dangle, knees bent at the edge of the hotel bed. His\nbody spreads across the center. One hand covers his face, index finger and\nthumb rubbing harshly against his eyes. The other clutches his phone, and\npresses it against his flaming ear. &ldquo;Why aren&rsquo;t you picking up your phone? You\ncouldn&rsquo;t have thrown it out the window again.

He is powerful, but the dirt pulls him to the ground with its\nmuddy hands, and steadies him for the hurricane that is to strike. He cannot\nmove. He stands and relives the events that baffle his brain: she walks away;\nshe dismisses him with a fragile goodnight, a farewell that he fears will be\nthe last; he confesses his secrets and she scrambles with strange abandonment.\nOver a dozen times does he relive those taunting moments, seconds ticking\nfurther and further away.</p><p>This\ndoesn\u2019t make the least bit of sense to him. He can imagine it from his\nperspective without strife. He professes his love, and it unveils a grand twist\nto their years-long story. He can taste the sorrow on her lips, a mixture of\nsalt and relief. He can feel the dip in her neck where his eager hands find a\nhome, fingertips pressing with a passion. He can imagine her sweet lips to\nconfess the eight letters that welcome heaven to his heart. When he opens his\neyes, he stares at an empty wall instead. Her presence lingers, but she is not\nhere.\u00a0</p><p>Harry\ndoesn\u2019t make a sound. He doesn\u2019t know if she sleeps tenderly under the comfort\nof her sheets \u2013 if exhaustion makes it that much easier for her to rest. He\ndoes not pick apart his brain to imagine, because to imagine her all snug in\nhis shaded arms is too much to bear. Consequently, with the last ounce of\nenergy that he has left, he shakes the desire from his clouded mind, and walks\naway.</p><p><b><i>&gt;Can you please call me back?</i></b><b><i>\u00a0</i></b></p><p><b><i>&gt;I\u2019m sorry if I was pressuring you. It wasn\u2019t my intention.</i></b><b><i>\u00a0</i></b></p><p><b><i>&gt;I leave on the sixth. Can we please talk before then?</i></b></p><p>Messages\nslither their way into Harry\u2019s everyday routine. Unanswered calls are a given, and\nhis desperate voicemails are almost therapeutic. His time ticks away, and it\nfills with him an anxiety that no crowd can ever compare with. In the days that\nfollow, he succumbs to self-hatred. He will never forgive himself for ruining\nsomething so special. A fresh sheet once written with loving memories is\nnothing but a smudge of ink, a ball that he crumples with his own bare hands.\nThe wrinkles and creases can never return to their former smooth state,\neternally marking his selfish behavior in the folded lines.</p><p>Four days\ncome and go. He goes longer periods of time without communicating with y/n, but\nthis particular situation has his head spinning off and into the clouds. She\nhas yet to call him back, and he will have to leave soon. His career requires\nhis attention elsewhere, in places that y/n cannot go. Somewhere in his mind,\nhe wonders if that is her plan. Does she count the days, waiting for him to\ndisappear so that <i>finally</i> she can\ntoo?<br></p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d\nHarry asks her. His legs dangle, knees bent at the edge of the hotel bed. His\nbody spreads across the center. One hand covers his face, index finger and\nthumb rubbing harshly against his eyes. The other clutches his phone, and\npresses it against his flaming ear. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you picking up your phone? You\ncouldn\u2019t have thrown it out the window again. Why can\u2019t you just call me back\nor send me a message to fuck off? Why do you insist on being so\u2014\u201d<br></p>[[MORE]]<p>Harry stops\nhimself. He considers the word on his tongue: <i>annoying.</i> She is being remarkably annoying, impossibly infuriating,\na down-right <i>burden.</i> The worst part\nof it all is that she does nothing. She ignores him and continues to live her\nown separate life, and there really isn\u2019t anything she can do to control how\nannoying she\u2019s being. In spite of this, there is a beat that his heart reserves\nfor only her.<br></p><p>\u201cJust call\nme back. Please. Anything.\u201d<br></p><p>By the time\nthe sixth rolls around, Harry parallels a broken record of apologies and pleas.\nHe considers, in a hopeful part of his mind, that it is her favorite one to\nplay. She does not make any attempts to throw out the vinyl that screams with\ndeep scratches, so she must enjoy the melody of his broken heart and dance in\nhis misery. As cruel as it sounds, he prefers this over the possibility that\nshe simply wishes to wear out the beloved composition until there is nothing\nleft to let go of.<br></p><p>Chances are\nthat this is why he has not sought out the most obvious of solutions. He knows\nthe route to her apartment, he knows when she is absent and when she is at\nhome. He even knows how to sneak his way in, and though it may be a psychotically\ndrastic turn, it is such an easy game for him to play. The fifty-fifty gamble,\nhowever, is what keeps him from paying her the visit. Cornering her to make a\ndecision \u2013 to love him back or to reject his heart once again \u2013 will give him a\ndefinite answer, and for once, uncertainty is his friend. He savors these\none-sided conversations because then he can imagine her listening on the other\nend. It is better than to know for certain if she does not care for him or his\nheart. It is better to suffer through the fatal chase than to not feel the pain\nat all.<br></p><p>As he\nboards the plane, he keeps his heart open. As he settles into his private seat,\nhe keeps her words with him. As he feels the runway disappear from beneath him,\nhe holds his phone steady in his hands, and composes his final attempt before\ndreaming in the clouds.\u00a0<br></p><p><b><i>&gt;I understand if you don\u2019t want to talk to me</i></b></p><p><b><i>&gt;but wherever I\u2019ll be, I\u2019ll still wait for your call.</i></b></p><p><b>\u00a0</b>Months pass\nby, and Harry revolves around a vacant world. He visits countries that are rich\nwith beauty. The roads are endless in their mystical magic. He passes strangers\non his journeys, and they tell him of how happy he appears; how genuine his\nsmile perceives. They don\u2019t know that he has not spoken to y/n in months, and\nit affects his craft in both a negative and positive way. She does not consume\nhim. He devotes his entirety to her, but his life goes on without her. He is\ncapable of finding humor in small things, distracts himself with the whimsical\nwonders of the world, and spares no thought to the woman who spears his love.\u00a0</p><p>He is doing fine, and he enjoys\nhimself frequently, but there comes a moment when everything stops. His brain\npeaks at an image of her: she walks away, and it strikes a hollow spark within.\nHe laughs, he listens, he lives \u2013 at the end of the day, she is there, and the\nsullen moments of that night sneak up on him like a killer in the shadows.</p><p>Tonight, he celebrates. Despite his\nextravagant lifestyle, Harry prefers intimate get-togethers to explosive\nevents. He\u2019s not one to sell himself to the wealthiest festivities that shower\nhim in praise and flaunt his name. He doesn\u2019t need the exploitation, but\ntonight, he tries not to mind it. He steps into the empty elevator and listens\nto the doors close behind him as Jeff presses the button to the party\u2019s floor.\nWhile his friend fixes his appearance last minute in the reflective surface of\nthe elevator walls, Harry gazes at the number rising above his head.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not plannin\u2019 on staying long,\u201d\nhe says, observing his own appearance in the reflection. It is nothing too\nlavishing for a company\u2019s anniversary party, but it has enough flare to\nproperly mark it as his own style.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m there as long as you are,\u201d\nJeff responds. He releases his hands from the collar of his button-up. \u201cAre you\ngoing to head back to your hotel room?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe. Although I am in the mood\nfor anything other than late-night television.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>His friend laughs, nodding his head\nin agreement. \u201cYou\u2019re the boss. But try to not get too crazy tonight, you still\nhave emails to respond to the morning, and another meeting over Skype.\u201d</p><p>Jeff goes on with his business\ntalk, and Harry isn\u2019t too sure about whether he\u2019s grateful for this or not.\nIt\u2019s nice to indulge into a schedule for the next day, but it is also nice to\nnot worry over the chaos of his career for one night. In the interim of their\ndiscussion, the elevator dings and pauses motion. When Harry looks up, he sees\nthat there are still a few more floors to go, but the sparkling doors open, and\nthe two friends give each other a look.</p><p>A man is the first to enter. He\nshines in a flamboyantly bold outfit, one that is sure to present him with the\nattention that he desires. He flashes a charming smile, presses his palms flat\nagainst the side of the doors, and tilts his head to shout over his shoulder.\n\u201cHurry your asses up or I\u2019m going without you!\u201d</p><p>The confident man moves himself\ninto the back-right corner, with Harry and Jeff silent against the adjacent\nback wall. An exasperated \u201cMy god,\u201d breathes out from the hallway, faint\nfootsteps rush down the carpet floors. Harry takes a step forward, situating\nhimself near the keypad with a finger pushing down on the button that keeps the\ndoors open. While waiting for the next person to arrive, he takes a quick\nglance at the man in the corner and wonders where he has seen his face before.</p><p>\u201cSasha, you better be holding open\nthe doors!\u201d the woman yells, which causes the three men to chuckle with each\nother in time. Harry, however, settles down from the amusement fairly quickly\nas he peruses the familiar voice. He doesn\u2019t ponder for long, because sooner\nthan later, the mysterious woman appears by the doors and glares at her friend.\nShe opens her plump lips as if to curse at him, but notices the other two\nentities and shifts her demeanor. \u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t know\u2014\u201d</p><p>The woman pauses her sentence. She\nobserves Harry and Jeff, who she comes to realize are not mere strangers\nhitching for a ride up. Harry feels his heart drop for a short moment, his finger\nfalls from the sleek button. Her perfecting attire radiates with a dazzling\nenergy amid the dull and hazy lights, and her smile is far brighter than Harry\nrecalls last seeing.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d she exclaims. She walks over\nthe threshold, and takes a step closer to Harry with her arms outstretching for\na hug. \u201cIt\u2019s been a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSophia,\u201d Harry greets her. He\nallows her to pull him in for a reuniting embrace, patting her back in a gently\nand amiable manner. \u201cLovely to see you.\u201d</p><p>Though his voice is monotone, he is\nhonest with his words. It is a surprise to see Sophia on this strange night,\nbut she has always been a delight to him and those around her. He begins to\nfeel better about the crowd that this party will bring, but a startling notion\ntwirls in the field of his flower-mind. Sophia pulls away, delivers a\nmillion-dollar smile, and strolls over to greet Jeff, who she is also an\nacquaintance of. The elevator doors begin to push together, and Harry lets out\na sigh of relief for what he believes will be a smooth night from here on out.</p><p>\u201cWait! Sasha!\u201d someone calls out\nfrom the hallway, their footsteps patter against the carpet floors. A manicured\nhand reaches out to the narrow space left between the closing doors. Harry\u2019s\neyes bulge out of his head, but he is quick to act upon the situation unlike\nthe three mindless bystanders. He reaches out to wave his hand in front of the\ndoors while simultaneously pushing the button that keeps them open. Sasha, on\nthe other hand, stands unbothered in his corner, smart phone in hand. He looks\nup in time to see the doors opening once again, but fails to catch the\nincredulous gaze shared between two long-lost friends.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Sasha mumbles, and returns\nto his device.\u00a0</p><p>Time ticks away, and the stare\nlingers on, but Harry feels the universe falter in its continuous lifetime.\nHaving her in the flesh reminds him of his hopeless attempts, and in one frail\nsecond, their paths intersect for one painfully perfect moment. It scares him\nthen of what she will do, and in this confined box with four other people, he\nwishes to be alone. One look at her eyes \u2013 once leaking in pain; one look at\nher cheeks \u2013 once staining in melancholy tears; one look at her and he\nremembers how it had felt to see her walk away.</p><p>Despite his fears, he does not\nanticipate a smile. An authentic smile reaching to her sparkling eyes that\ndisguise behind layers of beauty products to accentuate her marvelous attire.\nEven so, there is no difference in how his eyes perceive her. Whether she is in\na glamorous element or spilling her secrets through sobs, his entire heart\nbelongs to her. His heart that fluctuates with emotions momentarily settles on\njust one. Before he can return the kind gesture, before he can exhale with\ncontent and glee, her arms pull him in by the shoulders. She wraps herself softly\naround his frame, and her scent is the most divine, but he can only bask in it\nfor a second before associating it with the torture he knows all too well.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHi, Harry,\u201d she says, and faintly\nnuzzles her chin in the crook of his neck. \u201cHaven\u2019t heard from you in a while.\u201d</p><p>Harry stiffens. Over her shoulder,\nhe can see the doors closing for a final time. He can hear the other three in\ntheir own conversation. He can feel her warm breath sending twisters down his\nspine. It is over her shoulder that the color of the world shifts to gray. She\nhas not heard from him in a while, but he calls her at least once every week.\nTry as he might, he cannot forget her, and so he reaches out with hope that\nevery call will be the one she finally answers.</p><p>Her grip eases, though Harry\u2019s arms\nhave long fallen from her waist. She pulls away, and peers up at him with\ncaution in her eyes. Her smile paints a completely different picture. \u201cHow\u2019ve\nyou been?\u201d she asks, purses her lips. Her casual behavior makes him sad, and if\nhe isn\u2019t mistaken, she looks to be begging him to stay quiet; she\u2019s begging him\nto not start something tonight that is unfinished from months ago.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d he mumbles, but the answer\ncarries more significance than he lets on. She goes to stand by Sasha, but he\nrecalls his messages; he recalls how on her end, the decline button saves her.\nThe option to mute his conversation is a gift. Clearing her voicemail box is\nlifting a weight that she had never wanted on her shoulders. Her solution is to\npretend. She does as his first voicemail had asked her and pretends that the\nsecret night of confessions had never happened. She somehow pushes that memory\naway and pretends that everything is fine in their broken friendship.</p><p>She pretends that his love does not\nexist, and that is the greatest pain of all.\u00a0</p><p>The ride up the remaining floors is\nuncomfortable for him, especially when he realizes that the trio are going to\nthe same party that he is. Where Jeff mingles in a short conversation with\nSophia and Sasha \u2013 who Harry now remembers seeing in one of y/n\u2019s Instagram\nposts \u2013 the younger man stands in his isolation by the keypad. He starts to\ndoubt that she is in love with him too. He wishes for her to spare him a\nglance; he wants to see the weakness in her frown. He cannot fathom how it is\npossible to stay away from the person that has one\u2019s heart, or even act as\nthough they barely exist. If he is to see that weakness, that pouty little\nexpression, <i>then</i> he will know if she\ntruly loves him too.</p><p>It feels like lifetimes before the\nelevator doors open to a floor that drowns in music. Sasha is the first of the\ntrio to step out, sashaying as he opens up Snapchat on his phone with a single\nhand. Harry reminisces a time when his younger self had grown fond of Twitter.\nWith a harsh push under the spotlight, he\u2019s since then snapped out of the\nsocial network daze and has learned a great deal of restraint. It is that\nrestraint that has kept him from checking up on y/n\u2019s profiles in those lonely\nfew months, but he wonders if he had taken the chance to peak, would he have\nknown about her appearance tonight?</p><p>\u201cNice catching up, Jeff,\u201d Sophia\nsays. She links her arm with y/n\u2019s, helping her friend out the elevator since\nshe can\u2019t find it within herself to look up. As they pass by Harry, Sophia\nturns her head and sends him a nod and a smirk, which is far more attention\nthan y/n has given him in the past few months.</p><p>Harry smiles politely and allows\nthe two women to scurry away before trailing far behind them. He steps out onto\nthe floor, Jeff right on his tail, and the sea of beautiful faces begin to gawk\nat the legend before them. \u201cDid you know that y/n would be here?\u201d Harry asks, aware\nthat the madness will soon mask his voice.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Jeff answers, but tilts his\nhead at the question. \u201cI figured between the two of us, you would have been the\none to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike she said,\u201d Harry replies,\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a while.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>After the so-called falling out,\nHarry had refused to talk about it with anyone. It isn\u2019t as if what had\nhappened embarrasses him, or that he falls in line with the other men who find\nit <i>un-masculine</i> to speak openly about\ntheir feelings. He doesn\u2019t associate expressing emotions to be masculine or\nfeminine; it is a human quality, a necessity and a treasure. The situation is\njust far too delicate for him. Y/n is a fragment belonging to a rare batch of\npeople that he trusts; the world is sometimes so cruel and unkind, and y/n is\nthe uniqueness that makes it worthwhile. Above anything, she is his friend, and\nhe will suffer through that title than to not have her at all. The only person\nthat he tells this to, is his mother.</p><p>\u201cI figured Sophia would be here,\u201d\nJeff says as they near the room that hosts the party. Harry gives him a\nquizzical look, silent for an explanation. \u201cShe endorses a lot of companies on\nher Instagram. This is like a party and a business deal for her.\u201d</p><p>Of course. This new generation of\nnetworking supports a numerous amount of careers, ones that cannot exist\nwithout the thing he avoids the most. Sophia has an impressive following, so it\nmakes sense for her to be an attendee at this precious little soiree. With her\nand y/n practically attached at the hip, Harry understands how y/n manages to\nstick herself in a strange combination of people. She herself views her life as\nsimilar as the next average human being struggling for survival. She is a\nperson who shops in the sale section, dines at McDonald\u2019s, and pays her rent\nlate every now and then; the lavishing lifestyle is not her safe space.</p><p>Even so, she takes part in an\ninteresting act. Her compliance to a night full of hype and hysteria, flashing\ncameras and mindful eyes \u2013 it is not who she is, but she portrays the role very\nwell. She walks into the party, grinning at the other guests, though Harry has\na deep instinctive feeling that she now wants nothing more than to go back\nhome.</p><p>An hour passes and Harry has\nsuccessfully mingled with his friends, even going so far as to indulge in\nentertaining conversations with new faces. He doesn\u2019t know it until he is\ndowning his third glass, but the tequila has been rather inviting. He should\ndetest the burning taste; it is partially to blame for his impulsion on <i>that</i> night, and the voicemail that had\nled him to a slippery slope of solitude. So <i>damn\nthe tequila</i>, he says to himself, glaring at the innocent drink, but <i>damn,</i> the tequila resembles a craving\nthat he has been missing. It feels so strangely smooth running down his pretty\nthroat, and he feels it electrifying his veins.\u00a0</p><p>Another hour passes. He giggles\nmore often than usual. People come up to him to take pictures \u2013 praising him\nand flaunting his name \u2013 and he sticks his wild tongue out in almost all of\nthem. He grows affectionate and clings to his friends, but <i>only</i> his friends. He cannot find the person that he really wants to\ncuddle. He\u2019s not even sure if she\u2019s still at the party, but frankly, he doesn\u2019t\ncare. This is his night, and he wants to spend it in a hazy cloud of illusions,\ndrowning in the purple lights and blaring music.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d Jeff tugs at his shoulder.\nHarry sits on a stool in front of the bar, and his friend swivels his chair in\nhis direction. His sudden contact startles Harry, but he relaxes when he sees\nthe face of a man he heavily relies on. \u201cAre you ready to go?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Harry smiles. His lips fold tightly\ntogether, his flush face exposing his current state of mind. \u201cNot yet.\u201d He\nshakes his head. He swivels his chair back to the front, calls the bartender\nover so that he can order him and his bestest best friend \u2013 <i>don\u2019t tell Mitch </i>\u2013 a persuasive shot.</p><p>\u201cNot for me,\u201d Jeff declines, waving\nhis hand horizontally in a slicing motion across his throat. \u201cAnd honestly, you\nshould consider holding back too.\u201d</p><p>Harry can barely hear his voice\nover the music and overlapping conversations. Still, he makes out the general\ndetails, and something about his words have Harry gushing at his friend. He\ngrins up at him, dimples and all, and guides his heavy arms over Jeff\u2019s\nshoulders. \u201cAh, you\u2019re so caring, you little\u2014\u201d Harry finishes his sentence with\na growl, attacking his friend\u2019s closest cheek by taking a playful bite between\nhis pearly teeth. \u201cVery caring, you are. I\u2019m fine, I swear. I\u2019m having a good\ntime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes! It\u2019s a party, Jeffery! Go out\nand enjoy yourself.\u201d</p><p>Despite his encouragement, Jeff\ntakes a seat on the stool next to Harry and keeps him company. He stays for his\nfriend, who he knows is a bit of an impulsive drunk, and also someone that\nrelishes in camaraderie. It is also more challenging, Jeff says, for the pesky\nstrangers and tag-alongs to come up to Harry when he is already in a private conversation\nwith his manager. Therefore, the friends talk, and they laugh, and one has to\nkeep the other from losing all of his brain cells. It is a nice pattern that\nensues for half an hour until Jeff announces that he needs to use the restroom.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be right back,\u201d he says into\nHarry\u2019s ear, two hands pat his shoulders before he is off on his quest. While\nhe has fair intentions, Harry knows that he will not <i>be right back.</i> He will spend some time actually looking for the\ntoilets, squirm through tightly packed bodies both stationary and in rhythmic\nmotion. At an event like this, there is also surely to be a line. Then to\nsquirm his way back \u2013 it will be some time before he returns, which means that\nfor some time, Harry will be alone. Right now, Harry alone is a very dangerous\ncircumstance.</p><p>His first mistake is to order\nanother shot. A shot of what exactly, he\u2019s not too sure, but if it\u2019s the damned\ntequila then his mistake is much graver than he anticipates. His second mistake\nis to notice the hard, solid item in the back pocket of his trousers. It starts\nto bother him, especially with the seating position that he is in. He pulls the\ndevice out, and glares at how comfortably it fits in his right hand. His third\nmistake \u2013 oh, he certainty fears his third. A devious and curious thought\nflashes with warning, but before he can stop himself, he unlocks his phone and\npulls up the Instagram app. Notifications begin to pop up as they normally do,\nand sometimes it is difficult to wrap his head around the large numbers.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t go on now to gawk at the\nnumbers or scroll through his feed. He taps on the search bar, thumbs hesitant\nfor a second before typing away at the keyboard until her familiar handle\nappears. It has been months since he\u2019s seen her profile, even before his visit\nto her apartment. Her biography is simple and sweet, her profile photo is a\ntrue depiction of who she is. Her posts are a combination of snapshots, from\nmirror selfies to remarkable scenery to fun nights to memes, memes, and memes.\nAll of it is boldly her, but her most recent post captivates his attention.\u00a0</p><p>He clicks on the slightly edited\npicture to enlarge the two women who pose together. Taken from the waist up,\nthe duo flashes similar seductive expressions at the camera. Sophia\u2019s body faces\nforward, her head tilts to accentuate her jawline, and a wine glass hangs from\nher fingertips. Y/n positions herself sideways, her back presses against\nSophia\u2019s arm, and her head aligns to her propped shoulder. Her features are\npudgier than Sophia\u2019s, her face not as defined, and her attire much less\nluxurious. To him, she glows amid the bustling bodies frozen in the background\nof their moment.</p><p>Her caption consists of a few\nplayful emoji\u2019s, another thing he isn\u2019t too fond of, but their innocence and liveliness\nin graphic and color makes him smile. If he remembers correctly, she doesn\u2019t\nmiss an opportunity to insert a clever caption, so he can imagine her\nfrustration at this party. He envisions her picking at her brain for the least\nbit of intellect left, cursing at people\u2019s buffoonery and celebration, but\nultimately deciding on the series of vague emoji\u2019s. She posts it an hour ago,\nominous without a location tag as the background does not give too much away.\nHe doesn\u2019t know if this means that she still breathes in the festivities or if\nit is her goodnight to the world before she hops on her flight back home.</p><p>\u201cHaving a good time?\u201d a loud voice\nshouts into ear, grips his left shoulder, and lets their hand hang from the\nfirm crevice of his warm neck.</p><p>Harry nearly drops his phone\nface-down on the wet laminate surface of the bar. His heart races as he makes a\nquick and sly move to lock his phone, the screen turns black mid-jolt of surprise.\nHe swerves to his right side to meet with his intruder, and discovers a pair of\nrecognizable piercing eyes. They\u2019re cordial in their own sense, but the\nintimidation that laces somewhere beneath her irises is unmistakable. He\nresponds to her with a polite smile and nonchalant nod, which for her is enough\nof an invitation to pull up the empty stool next to him and stay. His attention\ndoesn\u2019t remain on her for too long, because after he acknowledges her presence,\nhe faces forward again with the desire to submerge himself in another drink.</p><p>\u201cIt was a struggle to get to you,\u201d\nSophia remarks, one pant-clad leg crosses over the other. A manicured hand\nwhirls in the storm of her luscious locks, and her stilettos droop from the\nfirm shape of her feet with only a mere strap keeping them intact. \u201cI had a\ntussle with about three other people to get here.\u201d</p><p>At this, Harry laughs. His\nshoulders shake, his eyes squint, and his tiny tongue sticks out between his\nteeth. \u201cI\u2019m sure you really ruffed them up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah.\u201d Sophia smiles. \u201cYou sure\nare loved.\u201d</p><p>She means it endearingly \u2013 not in\nthe kiss-ass manner that many people do to him tonight, but with fair\nintentions of bringing comfort to an otherwise lonesome man. Either way, Harry\ndelivers a sad smile to the tabletop. His hands fidget with each other, and\nthen gravitates another one of his ordered drinks to him. He spins the glass\nwith his calloused fingers, watches the liquid slosh around in its crystalline\nconfinement.</p><p> \u201cNot by everyone,\u201d he says, clutches his\nglass, and raises it to his pink and swollen lips. He tilts his head back, downing\nthe contents as his eyes flutter shut. Sophia is in his peripheral vision, and\nshe watches him with a sincere, sympathetic look. Such a pity party he is, and\nit is usually at this low point that he decides to call it a night, rest his\nintoxicating thoughts, and suffer with vile regret in the late morning.</p><p>What stops\nhim tonight is Sophia\u2019s sweet and simple look that informs him of a simple\ntruth: she knows. No matter how much she succeeds in ignoring his texts, and\nhis calls, and his voicemails, y/n\u2019s tongue speaks his name after that final\ngoodnight. It contorts and curls and flattens with an elaboration of their card\ngame with a twist, and perhaps even licks away at the salty sensation of her\nrecollection. He\u2019s suspicious to the idea that perhaps this isn\u2019t as easy for\nher as he believes. She cannot push his memory beyond existence until it is\nnothing but a ghost filling her lungs with smoke; she suffers just as he does.<br></p><p>\u201cDoes she\ntalk about me?\u201d Harry wonders aloud, sets his glass down with a harsh <i>clink!</i> He turns to Sophia, who already\nhas an impressively fierce look in her eyes, one eyebrow creating an arch to\ncompete against his inquiry.<br></p><p>\u201cWho does?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cRight,\nlet\u2019s skip the part where you pretend that y/n hasn\u2019t told you.\u201d<br></p><p>Sophia\ndoesn\u2019t waver. She narrows her eyes, a test to Harry to see how long she can\ndrag out her charade. It is an intense stare-down on her end, but the charming\nman does not give into her antics. His face sags, not necessarily into a frown,\nbut rather a worn-out mien that has been through a fair share of\ndisappointment.<br></p><p>He wins at\nher sigh of defeat, the pout in her lips replacing her once confident\nimpression. To say the least, his reward is not rewarding. \u201cNot really,\u201d Sophia\nhesitantly answers, \u201cbut she wants to! I think. At least for your sake, I hope\nshe does.\u201d<br></p><p>Harry\nscoffs, but nods his head repetitively to sink down the information that cannot\nprocess with the empty glass he holds. He knows what she refers to when she\nsays for <i>his</i> sake: he is a complete\nmess without her, barely subdues his sorrows with his need for poison, fails to\nforget her. She cannot be more wrong. He doesn\u2019t need her. His life in the past\ncouple of months have flown with ease, with happiness and health. If anything,\nhis lack of communication with her distracts him less from the truest and most\nhonest love of his life: his music. Y/n does not meet the criteria that is\nnecessary for his complex existence. He does not need her.</p><p>\u201cSo, she\u2019s\nblocking me out,\u201d Harry concludes, blinks away the dizziness and polychromatic\ndots that float across his vision like butterflies. He knows that she\u2019s been\nignoring him, that much is obvious \u2013 but to block him out? To hide him away in\na place of her confusing brain that she cannot possibly reach? That is nearly\nimpossible.<br></p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s\ngoing on with her life. I think maybe you should consider doing that too.\u201d<br></p><p>Harry sends\nher an incredulous look. \u201cMe? What do you think I\u2019ve been doing? Sitting around\nhere, waiting for her call?\u201d<br></p><p>Sophia\nreplies with a mocking expression. It is enough for him to recall the last\nvoicemail he had sent before boarding the plane to a new life without her.<br></p><p>\u201cJesus,\u201d\nHarry grumbles. \u201cSo much for not talking about me.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cHarry,\nplease. I\u2019m not here to be hostile.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cEnlighten\nme then, Soph. After all, you did tussle with three other people to get here.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a\nclass act, Styles.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cDid she\nsend you or something? To tell me to piss off?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cNo! If she\nwanted you to piss off, she would tell you herself.\u201d<br></p><p>Harry stays\nsilent, as silent as he can possibly be in this bizarre setting. He fixes his\nattention on Sophia, who has caution in her eyes, similar to a child caught\nwith their hand in the cookie jar. He searches her intensely, wonders if he\nhears her correctly, or if his surmise is far off from what she really means.\n\u201cWhy doesn\u2019t she then?\u201d he asks, the words play over like a tragic symphony. He\npleas for an answer, almost whining with child-like eyes glassing over with\npure innocence.<br></p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t\nanswer that for her,\u201d Sophia says, \u201cbut as her friend, I can tell you what I\nthink she deserves.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cIs it me?\u201d<br></p><p>Sophia\npurses her lips, spreads the smooth lipstick over her plump lips. \u201cIt\u2019s not\nthis,\u201d she answers, a hint in her determined voice feeling bad for him. \u201cWhatever\n<i>this</i> actually is. A back-and-forth.\nYou call her, she ignores you. It\u2019s taking a toll on her having to deal with\nthis every week, same as it did that night. I\u2019m not saying that y/n is innocent\nin this, because clearly, she\u2019s not, but she has her reasons. You need to respect\nthem.\u201d<br></p><p>Harry wants\nto cry. He wants to release everything that y/n stores in him: the rage, the\nmourning, the self-pity, the love. The endless, endless love that he doesn\u2019t\never imagine he can have for someone in this whirlwind of a lifetime. It\u2019s become\ntoo much, but he still doesn\u2019t understand how it has come to this. What are her\nreasons? What compels her to stay away from something that can be so bloody\nbrilliant?<br></p><p>\u201cShe\ndoesn\u2019t need to love someone that worries her all the time,\u201d Sophia continues.\nThe heedful filter inside of her runs out, her words confirming to him the\ntruths he\u2019s always known. If she is to do anything for her friend, it is this.\n\u201cShe needs someone who\u2019s there, Harry. I know you want to be, but have you ever\nstopped to consider her side of things?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he\nanswers instantly, breathing out through his mouth. He blinks sluggishly, a\nstrange effect taking over. \u201cShe\u2019s \u2026 she can be\u2026\u201d<br></p><p>Sophia\nwaits for an answer that doesn\u2019t appear. \u201cShe can be a what?\u201d<br></p><p><i>Loved.</i> She can be loved by anyone, and\nanyone who is lucky enough to make her heart happy should be enough for him.\nBut it isn\u2019t. It isn\u2019t, because he is selfish, and he loves her too much to let\nthis be the end of it. She can be loved by anyone, but she will find something\neternal that is worth the heartache if she is to be loved by him.<br></p><p>\u201cShe can be\nwith me,\u201d Harry slurs, a hiccup raking through his body. He looks pathetic, he\nknows he does, but none of it matters. Whatever happens tomorrow doesn\u2019t matter\nif tonight means nothing.<br></p><p>Sophia\nshakes her head. She uncrosses a leg and stretches it out onto the sweaty\ndancefloor. She adjusts her outfit, rakes a hand through her hair, and points a\nlazy finger at Harry. \u201cThat is not for you to decide,\u201d she tells him, and\nshakes her head again as a proper farewell. Her legs only carry her so far\nbefore Harry\u2019s calling back at her.<br></p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d he\nshouts, audible to her, but deaf to the drunks surrounding them. Sophia whirls\naround, stands tall in her place as bodies mistakenly push into her. \u201cThis\nisn\u2019t for <i>you</i> to decide! I\u2019m sorry,\nSophia, but this concerns me and this concerns y/n. <i>No </i>one else.\u201d Harry stands to his feet, the glass in his hands serving\nno purpose but to fuel his veins prior to his assertive nature taking over. He\nrotates his head in every direction, moving mindlessly through the storming\ncrowd as Sophia begins to hold him back.<br></p><p>\u201cWhat are\nyou\u2014\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWhere is\nshe?\u201d he demands, swivels his way around her as he would with a pesky tree in\nhis path. \u201cWe need to talk.\u201d<br></p><p><i>\u201cNo!\u201d</i> Sophia reprimands, using all of\nher might to pull him back by the eager arm. She leans back on her stilettos,\nbut he practically drags her across the floor. To any onlooker, the interaction\nappears as harmless as two friends having a playful laugh. \u201cNo, you are not!\nDon\u2019t even think about it, fucker!\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cFoul\nmouth, Sophia.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t\na game! You can\u2019t just press pause and resume as if it doesn\u2019t affect anyone\nelse! Think about <i>her</i> for once!\u201d</p><p>Harry comes\nto a halt. Sophia\u2019s body rams into his back, she huffs but refuses to let go of\nher hold on his arm. She doesn\u2019t strike a chord in him with her words, nor does\nshe persuade him to back off. In reality, the world around him comes to a stop.\nNo one else matters, whether they are gawking at him or serving him no\nattention. She stands there, in the midst of all the chaos, and her universe\ncollides with his for a single, mere moment. She gapes at him, and her limbs\nfreeze, and whatever Sasha is yelling into one ear goes out the other. He is\ndeaf to the music, blind to the lights, and he cannot feel anything but the\nbeat of his aching heart.<br></p><p>\u201cI think\nabout her all the time,\u201d he says in a hushed tone, a mantra that he recites,\nassuring him of his affection. No one else hears his special words, but maybe\ny/n focuses on him long enough to read his quivering lips. He does not know; she\nis a statue in her own world, a piece of art that he admires and displays to\nthe mass for all of her beauties, but at the end of the day, she is his. She is\na separate entity of pure magic, but she belongs to him, and he gives up\neverything to have her.<br></p><p>Harry\ncontinues his walk, which worries Sophia as she starts tugging him back again.\nThe closer he gets to y/n, the more his stomach squirms and twists and flips.\nHe does, however, find ease in slipping through the crowd; it feels as if they\npart for him, relishing in the cinematic moment that is to take place with a\nfew more meager steps. When he does eventually reach her, he finds himself\nfrowning, because she cannot bear to look him in the eyes. She searches the\nrumbling floor, closing in on herself as if to disappear.<br></p><p>\u201cI miss\nyou,\u201d Harry says, and he somehow finds the strength to overpower the music that\nis disparate to this specific point in time. \u201cLook at me,\u201d he demands of her,\nbut dares not to touch her fragile cocoon. \u201cY/n, please.\u201d His voice wavers,\nweak and damaged, reaching out to her even if she does not want him to.<br></p><p>Sasha darts\nhis eyes between the two friends, or lovers \u2013 he\u2019s not quite sure. \u201cWhat\u2019s\ngoing on?\u201d he asks, oblivious to y/n\u2019s lack of comfort, and the manner in which\nher systems fail to save her. She feels the familiar burn in her nose,\nremembers the last time Harry had begun a sentence with <i>I</i> and had ended it with <i>you.</i>\nIt hits her in a single slap of a moment, time quite irrelevant as the tears\nstart to break apart from her soft eyes.<br></p><p>She can\u2019t be here, so she does the\nlittle something that he haunts himself with every day, and the image of her\nwalking away for a second time has his knees growing weak, almost failing to\nsupport the gravity of her response. Yet, he keeps his ground. He watches the\nlittle shake of her head, though he doesn\u2019t know how she can disagree with his\ncertainty, and watches her legs carry her to the hallway outside of the party.\nIt is only this time that he refuses to let her go; he refuses to stand by and\nfeel sorry for himself, left to wonder where it had all gone wrong.</p><p>He follows\nher out; the yellow lights of the hallway and the sudden expanse of vacancy\ncauses a disturbance to his movements. He feels as if he is floating in\nmid-air, swimming to her, who is an albatross flying miles and miles above him.\n\u201cStop!\u201d he calls out, and the few who meander outside of the party turn their\nheads to find the source of outburst.<br></p><p>She doesn\u2019t\nstop, but he can see the flinch in her body at his command. Her legs carry her\nas fast as they are able to in the elevated footwear she sports, jewelry\njingling against each other, footsteps scrapping against the carpet floors. He\nhas no choice but to accelerate onward, using his advantage of comfortable\nshoes to match her speed until he surpasses her in the chase, turns on his\nheels, and blocks her open-ended path.<br></p><p>His words\nspeed out from his tongue, \u201cstop, stop, stop!\u201d His hands are on her shoulders\nnow, covered in the softest cloth he\u2019s ever known. \u201cIf you could please just\nstop and listen and talk to me\u2014\u201d<br></p><p><i>\u201cNo,\u201d</i> she croaks out, still rebuffing\nany eye-contact. Her arms poke out, pushing him away, but he is firm in his\nplace. With a final attempt, she musters up her remnants of energy and gives\nhim a solid shove, a forceful one that pushes her back from him until a space\nopens up between them.</p><p>Harry gapes\nat her. His eyebrows knit in shock, his mouth ajar as the words are suddenly\nlost. She stands in front of him with dejection pouring down and outlining the\nshape of her shrunken face. There is still no eye contact between them, but y/n\nfinally does not walk away. Her breaths are ragged, the walls feel as though\nthey\u2019re closing in. She nibbles on the inside of her cheek, and nervously\nwiggles her fingers down by her side.<br></p><p>\u201cWhy are\nyou doin\u2019 this?\u201d he asks, hands prop on his hips. He has to know. If all else\ngoes wrong, if it really is the end, then he has to know why.<br></p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t\nwant to do this right now.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cAlright,\nthen when? Because you certainly didn\u2019t want to talk about it two months ago,\nor any time I tried to reach you thereafter. Not even a descent message to let\nme know if you were even okay.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cMaybe\nbecause it wasn\u2019t any of your business!\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cThe hell it\nisn\u2019t! Tell me how you could be so stubborn to think that? Tell me how it\ndoesn\u2019t concern me at all\u2014\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cBecause\nthere is no <i>it</i>, Harry!\u201d y/n seethes,\nand lets out a teary scoff. \u201cThere is no <i>it</i>\nthat we have to talk about. It\u2019s not \u2013 it doesn\u2019t\u2026\u201d She doesn\u2019t notice it,\nbut she\u2019s practically in his face now. Looking into his eyes, the glimmer that\nshe admires is gone. She exhales a sigh, and lets her frustration simmer down\nbefore finishing her thought. \u201cIt\u2019s not there. It never had been.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not\ntrue,\u201d Harry disagrees, quick with the shake of his head. \u201cPlease, y/n, after\nall of this, you should know that\u2019s not true.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not in\nlove\u2014\u201d<br></p><p><i>\u201cDon\u2019t.</i>\u201d Harry leans in closer and\nwhispers. \u201cDon\u2019t try to push me away. You know there\u2019s something there because\neven if you feel nothing for me, even if it\u2019s only me and I\u2019m an idiot to be in\nlove with someone that doesn\u2019t love me back, it\u2019s still true. I\u2019m in love with\nyou, and that\u2019s still something.\u201d<br></p><p>With his\nhead tilting down to confess in her ear, y/n\u2019s eyes focus on the rolls of his\nneck to which a silver chain kisses and a blanket of warm skin hugs. It is so\neasy to fall into his words. So easy to bury herself in his embrace, to feel\nthe electric pull of his entire being. So, so easy.<br></p><p>\u201cSo, tell\nme again,\u201d he says, a soothing turn to the treacherous ambience that bubbles\nthem in, away from the world outside. \u201cTell me that you\u2019re not in love with me,\nbut don\u2019t try to tell me how I feel about you. Because it\u2019s always been you,\ny/n.\u201d<br></p><p>Y/n\u2019s lips\nwrinkle, a prominent pout that portrays the weakness he had once wanted to see.\nNow that his eyes sparkle over them so clearly, he wants nothing more than to\nwash her fragility away. \u201cNot always,\u201d she mumbles, her mouth moving to the\nside of her face. In consequence of that forms a smile, but there is nothing\nhumorous in the gesture. It\u2019s sad, frightfully so, as if she sees herself as\nnothing but a joke. \u201cIt\u2019s always been someone else. You know that. Even if in\nthe back of your mind you were thinking of me, you were with someone else. You\nmight think that everything you\u2019re saying is true, but I was never entirely\nyours. I knew that from the start.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cNo,\nthat\u2019s\u2026\u201d Harry shakes his head. He makes a bold decision to reach a single\nhand up \u2013 the left one, with his inked cross swaying back and forth to the\ncalming rhythm that she admires \u2013 and cups the side of her face in a graceful\nmanner. His touch hovers over her wet skin, and it hurts to know that it is his\ndoing. \u201cThat\u2019s entirely different, y/n.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cMaybe for\nyou.\u201d She shrugs. \u201cBut not to me. Not in my eyes.\u201d<br></p><p>What can he\nsay? It isn\u2019t as if he can convince her that her perspective is otherwise \u2013 he\nhas to validate these feelings. He has to understand her reasoning, or else he\nis right back where he had started.<br></p><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d\nHe nods, caressing a single thumb over her cheek. He savors the moment; the\nscent that he inhales is intoxicatingly addictive. He doesn\u2019t know when it will\nend, or when will be the last time he can breathe her in like this, so close\ntogether. \u201cI can\u2019t change that. I can\u2019t change how you viewed everything, and\nit\u2019s my fault that you even had to see it that way at all. I\u2019m to blame, and I\nknow that.\u201d<br></p><p>Y/n shakes\nher head. \u201cIt\u2019s not about pointing fingers, Harry.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI know. I\nknow it\u2019s not, but it\u2019s a start.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA start to\nwhat?\u201d y/n asks exasperatedly. She searches for something in him, but he\u2019s not\nsure of what exactly. An answer? A defeat? A silence that cannot possibly solve\nany of her inquiries and fears?<br></p><p>\u201cA start to\nwhatever the hell this is,\u201d Harry answers without a stutter in his voice. \u201cMe\nfiguring out how to prove to you that it <i>has</i>\nalways been you, and how I fear that it always <i>will </i>be you. That\u2019s not healthy, y/n, in a world of billions and\nonly being moved by one. If I have to spend the rest of my life proving myself\nto you, I won\u2019t hesitate to do it. Even if you don\u2019t want me, which I\u2019m sorry\nto say, but I\u2019m pretty sure we\u2019ve already found out is not the case.\u201d<br></p><p>Y/n softly chuckles, and it is\nthen he notices that her tears no longer flow. It is progress, and it has been\na struggle to get here. \u201cYou won\u2019t be able to,\u201d she says. \u201cI know my worth, but\nthat doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t tear myself apart sometimes. <i>You</i> don\u2019t make that any easier and the worst part is that it\u2019s not\neven your fault. You can\u2019t stop the rest of the world from loving you, so <i>I\u2019m</i> sorry to say that you won\u2019t be able\nto convince me of anything otherwise.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI beg to\ndiffer.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t\ncare.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t\nI just try?\u201d he asks, and this time his other hand follows. He has her entire\nface in his hold, and she looks so precious standing here, her faces squishes,\nher pouty but kissable lips. \u201cYou say that I don\u2019t make it easier, but you\nhaven\u2019t even tried to see if maybe it\u2019s not as hard as you think.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cBecause I\nknow myself better than anyone, Harry. Sometimes, I even know you better than\nyou know yourself. I envision your future and how everything will turn out, and\nI worry over things that don\u2019t even concern me. I live your life in ways that\nyou haven\u2019t even dreamed about and I understand your little catchphrases and\nyour antics. I do it all for you, because someone has to, and I don\u2019t know why\nit has to be, but it is. I do that for you, so pardon me if I already have an\nidea of how hellish this could turn out.\u201d<br></p><p>When y/n\nlooks up at Harry, she sees a wavering light that flickers with stardust. His\nuniverse has never looked lovelier, but it also has a strangeness to it that\nshe is not familiar with. Her little rant ends on a negative note, so she\ndoesn\u2019t know why he stares at her as though she is the first existence he has\never known.<br></p><p>\u201cGod, I\u2019m\nso in love with you,\u201d He declares, and he doesn\u2019t give her any time to process\nbefore he has his mouth over hers. It is inviting, to feel the shape that fits\nso well with his. <i>This</i> is the crave\nthat he has been missing, this sudden wild flare of emotions, and though it is\nnot perfect, it is more than enough for him.<br></p><p>Y/n mumbles\nagainst his lips, though he doesn\u2019t miss the fact that she pulls him in as much\nhe does to her. Her hand has found his waist, but her pesky lips keep mumbling,\nbreaking apart the contact that he wishes to endure for the rest of his life.\n\u201cNo, this is a bad idea,\u201d she speaks into his lips, the same hand on his waist\nnow faintly pushing him away.<br></p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s\nnot,\u201d he kisses back.<br></p><p>\u201cMm-mmm.\u201d\ny/n shakes her head. Their lips pull away, and when they do, she notices the\ntransfer of her lipstick onto his mouth. \u201cThis is,\u201d she pauses, and lets out a\nlaughing huff, \u201cthis is not going to work out at all.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWhy do you\nkeep saying that?\u201d he asks, his hands travel down to her shoulders. He rubs\nagainst them, then slithers his way down to her upper back. It is much harder\nfor her to escape him now. \u201cWhy can\u2019t you allow yourself this? You daydream\nabout the future but none of it matters because try as you might, you\u2019ll never\nreally know how amazing this can be.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cIt can\u2019t\nbe so amazing.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWhy bloody\nnot?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cBecause\nyou said so yourself!\u201d she exclaims, and he opens his mouth to retaliate, but\nshe beats him to the mark. \u201cYou might not have said it exactly, but you definitely\nsaid it. You said that this is your life and you can\u2019t slow down and that it\u2019s\ndifferent for you! As far as I\u2019m concerned, that doesn\u2019t sound so amazing. You\u2019re\nin the clouds now, Harry, and you\u2019re going to reach galaxies you\u2019ve never even\nimagined. From down on the ground, it looks like you\u2019re never going to stop,\nand you won\u2019t. You can\u2019t. Not even for the person that you\u2019re in love with.\u201d<br></p><p>Her words\nare fairly blunt, but Harry recalls their conversation. His single confession\nto her only play of a wild card, a distant memory that can properly place\nitself into another dimension. That night, they had not been happy. They had\nbeen foolish, going about the situation in all the wrong ways, because the\nsilence has never been their friend. Between them, there is never an absence,\nnever a stillness in the air. It has always been just them, the way they\ninteract with each other, whether it is a surplus of verbal words or\nconversations through their looks and gestures. They had been missing that\ntreasure on that cursed night, and neither of them were attentive enough to\nrealize it.<br></p><p>Harry\nsmiles at her. His dimple is prominent, and she has to keep herself from\nswooning at the close sight of it. \u201cYou don\u2019t know,\u201d he says, joy laces in his\ntone. She tilts her head in a quizzical manner: <i>know what?</i> she asks with her stare, the silence never prevailing. \u201cYou\ndon\u2019t know how everything looks like through my eyes. When I see you, and the\nworld gets hazy, and I can\u2019t hear or feel anything. My heart turns into\nsomething else, something I can\u2019t explain. I don\u2019t understand how when I\u2019m with\nyou, time just \u2026 stops. Everything stops for you.\u201d<br></p><p>Harry pulls\nher in slowly, their foreheads brushing as their noses crinkle against each\nother. \u201cI promise,\u201d he whispers, nudging at her so that she can welcome her\nsweet lips to his. \u201cEverything stops for you,\u201d he repeats, and connects their\nlips for a third time, and each one holds something different, something unexplainably\nspecial. He wants to say more, to further prove himself, and prove how well\ntheir love can be. He can\u2019t though, because her lips press against his, her\nhands wrap around him, and she lets herself fall in love with everything he is\nand everything he has to give.<br></p><p>After a\nshort lip-locking moment \u2013 where not much privacy ensues, and he tries not to\nmind whatever pictures surface the next morning \u2013 their movements become a\nlittle sloppier, and Harry has the devilish urge to bite on her swollen lip. He\npulls at it between his cheeky grin, which gets a grimacing smile out of her as\nthey separate. He can\u2019t control the flutter of laughter that escapes him,\nattacking her with a chaste kiss on her cheek before whispering in her ear. \u201cHey,\nif you\u2019re up for it, we can try out that kink of yours now.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cUgh.\u201d Y/n\nrolls her eyes, then reaches up to twist his nipple through his button-up. \u201cSuch\na gentleman you are.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cOw!\u201d he\nyelps, giggling as he palms at the sensitive area. \u201cYou didn\u2019t tell me that was\npart of it, cheeky lovie!\u201d</p>",

He does not register the silence until it\nsubmerges the entire apartment. His ears strain to catch even the faintest\nsound on the other side of the door. The painted walls muffle her movements;\nnot a single light shines from the crack at his feet.</p><p>The poor\nman is a blossoming flower; petals of sweetness expand from the force of\nnature\u2019s love. He is powerful, but the dirt pulls him to the ground with its\nmuddy hands, and steadies him for the hurricane that is to strike. He cannot\nmove. He stands and relives the events that baffle his brain: she walks away;\nshe dismisses him with a fragile goodnight, a farewell that he fears will be\nthe last; he confesses his secrets and she scrambles with strange abandonment.\nOver a dozen times does he relive those taunting moments, seconds ticking\nfurther and further away.</p><p>This\ndoesn\u2019t make the least bit of sense to him. He can imagine it from his\nperspective without strife. He professes his love, and it unveils a grand twist\nto their years-long story. He can taste the sorrow on her lips, a mixture of\nsalt and relief. He can feel the dip in her neck where his eager hands find a\nhome, fingertips pressing with a passion. He can imagine her sweet lips to\nconfess the eight letters that welcome heaven to his heart. When he opens his\neyes, he stares at an empty wall instead. Her presence lingers, but she is not\nhere.\u00a0</p><p>Harry\ndoesn\u2019t make a sound. He doesn\u2019t know if she sleeps tenderly under the comfort\nof her sheets \u2013 if exhaustion makes it that much easier for her to rest. He\ndoes not pick apart his brain to imagine, because to imagine her all snug in\nhis shaded arms is too much to bear. Consequently, with the last ounce of\nenergy that he has left, he shakes the desire from his clouded mind, and walks\naway.</p><p><b><i>&gt;Can you please call me back?</i></b><b><i>\u00a0</i></b></p><p><b><i>&gt;I\u2019m sorry if I was pressuring you. It wasn\u2019t my intention.</i></b><b><i>\u00a0</i></b></p><p><b><i>&gt;I leave on the sixth. Can we please talk before then?</i></b></p><p>Messages\nslither their way into Harry\u2019s everyday routine. Unanswered calls are a given, and\nhis desperate voicemails are almost therapeutic. His time ticks away, and it\nfills with him an anxiety that no crowd can ever compare with. In the days that\nfollow, he succumbs to self-hatred. He will never forgive himself for ruining\nsomething so special. A fresh sheet once written with loving memories is\nnothing but a smudge of ink, a ball that he crumples with his own bare hands.\nThe wrinkles and creases can never return to their former smooth state,\neternally marking his selfish behavior in the folded lines.</p><p>Four days\ncome and go. He goes longer periods of time without communicating with y/n, but\nthis particular situation has his head spinning off and into the clouds. She\nhas yet to call him back, and he will have to leave soon. His career requires\nhis attention elsewhere, in places that y/n cannot go. Somewhere in his mind,\nhe wonders if that is her plan. Does she count the days, waiting for him to\ndisappear so that <i>finally</i> she can\ntoo?<br></p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d\nHarry asks her. His legs dangle, knees bent at the edge of the hotel bed. His\nbody spreads across the center. One hand covers his face, index finger and\nthumb rubbing harshly against his eyes. The other clutches his phone, and\npresses it against his flaming ear. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you picking up your phone? You\ncouldn\u2019t have thrown it out the window again. Why can\u2019t you just call me back\nor send me a message to fuck off? Why do you insist on being so\u2014\u201d<br></p>[[MORE]]<p>Harry stops\nhimself. He considers the word on his tongue: <i>annoying.</i> She is being remarkably annoying, impossibly infuriating,\na down-right <i>burden.</i> The worst part\nof it all is that she does nothing. She ignores him and continues to live her\nown separate life, and there really isn\u2019t anything she can do to control how\nannoying she\u2019s being. In spite of this, there is a beat that his heart reserves\nfor only her.<br></p><p>\u201cJust call\nme back. Please. Anything.\u201d<br></p><p>By the time\nthe sixth rolls around, Harry parallels a broken record of apologies and pleas.\nHe considers, in a hopeful part of his mind, that it is her favorite one to\nplay. She does not make any attempts to throw out the vinyl that screams with\ndeep scratches, so she must enjoy the melody of his broken heart and dance in\nhis misery. As cruel as it sounds, he prefers this over the possibility that\nshe simply wishes to wear out the beloved composition until there is nothing\nleft to let go of.<br></p><p>Chances are\nthat this is why he has not sought out the most obvious of solutions. He knows\nthe route to her apartment, he knows when she is absent and when she is at\nhome. He even knows how to sneak his way in, and though it may be a psychotically\ndrastic turn, it is such an easy game for him to play. The fifty-fifty gamble,\nhowever, is what keeps him from paying her the visit. Cornering her to make a\ndecision \u2013 to love him back or to reject his heart once again \u2013 will give him a\ndefinite answer, and for once, uncertainty is his friend. He savors these\none-sided conversations because then he can imagine her listening on the other\nend. It is better than to know for certain if she does not care for him or his\nheart. It is better to suffer through the fatal chase than to not feel the pain\nat all.<br></p><p>As he\nboards the plane, he keeps his heart open. As he settles into his private seat,\nhe keeps her words with him. As he feels the runway disappear from beneath him,\nhe holds his phone steady in his hands, and composes his final attempt before\ndreaming in the clouds.\u00a0<br></p><p><b><i>&gt;I understand if you don\u2019t want to talk to me</i></b></p><p><b><i>&gt;but wherever I\u2019ll be, I\u2019ll still wait for your call.</i></b></p><p><b>\u00a0</b>Months pass\nby, and Harry revolves around a vacant world. He visits countries that are rich\nwith beauty. The roads are endless in their mystical magic. He passes strangers\non his journeys, and they tell him of how happy he appears; how genuine his\nsmile perceives. They don\u2019t know that he has not spoken to y/n in months, and\nit affects his craft in both a negative and positive way. She does not consume\nhim. He devotes his entirety to her, but his life goes on without her. He is\ncapable of finding humor in small things, distracts himself with the whimsical\nwonders of the world, and spares no thought to the woman who spears his love.\u00a0</p><p>He is doing fine, and he enjoys\nhimself frequently, but there comes a moment when everything stops. His brain\npeaks at an image of her: she walks away, and it strikes a hollow spark within.\nHe laughs, he listens, he lives \u2013 at the end of the day, she is there, and the\nsullen moments of that night sneak up on him like a killer in the shadows.</p><p>Tonight, he celebrates. Despite his\nextravagant lifestyle, Harry prefers intimate get-togethers to explosive\nevents. He\u2019s not one to sell himself to the wealthiest festivities that shower\nhim in praise and flaunt his name. He doesn\u2019t need the exploitation, but\ntonight, he tries not to mind it. He steps into the empty elevator and listens\nto the doors close behind him as Jeff presses the button to the party\u2019s floor.\nWhile his friend fixes his appearance last minute in the reflective surface of\nthe elevator walls, Harry gazes at the number rising above his head.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not plannin\u2019 on staying long,\u201d\nhe says, observing his own appearance in the reflection. It is nothing too\nlavishing for a company\u2019s anniversary party, but it has enough flare to\nproperly mark it as his own style.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m there as long as you are,\u201d\nJeff responds. He releases his hands from the collar of his button-up. \u201cAre you\ngoing to head back to your hotel room?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe. Although I am in the mood\nfor anything other than late-night television.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>His friend laughs, nodding his head\nin agreement. \u201cYou\u2019re the boss. But try to not get too crazy tonight, you still\nhave emails to respond to the morning, and another meeting over Skype.\u201d</p><p>Jeff goes on with his business\ntalk, and Harry isn\u2019t too sure about whether he\u2019s grateful for this or not.\nIt\u2019s nice to indulge into a schedule for the next day, but it is also nice to\nnot worry over the chaos of his career for one night. In the interim of their\ndiscussion, the elevator dings and pauses motion. When Harry looks up, he sees\nthat there are still a few more floors to go, but the sparkling doors open, and\nthe two friends give each other a look.</p><p>A man is the first to enter. He\nshines in a flamboyantly bold outfit, one that is sure to present him with the\nattention that he desires. He flashes a charming smile, presses his palms flat\nagainst the side of the doors, and tilts his head to shout over his shoulder.\n\u201cHurry your asses up or I\u2019m going without you!\u201d</p><p>The confident man moves himself\ninto the back-right corner, with Harry and Jeff silent against the adjacent\nback wall. An exasperated \u201cMy god,\u201d breathes out from the hallway, faint\nfootsteps rush down the carpet floors. Harry takes a step forward, situating\nhimself near the keypad with a finger pushing down on the button that keeps the\ndoors open. While waiting for the next person to arrive, he takes a quick\nglance at the man in the corner and wonders where he has seen his face before.</p><p>\u201cSasha, you better be holding open\nthe doors!\u201d the woman yells, which causes the three men to chuckle with each\nother in time. Harry, however, settles down from the amusement fairly quickly\nas he peruses the familiar voice. He doesn\u2019t ponder for long, because sooner\nthan later, the mysterious woman appears by the doors and glares at her friend.\nShe opens her plump lips as if to curse at him, but notices the other two\nentities and shifts her demeanor. \u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t know\u2014\u201d</p><p>The woman pauses her sentence. She\nobserves Harry and Jeff, who she comes to realize are not mere strangers\nhitching for a ride up. Harry feels his heart drop for a short moment, his finger\nfalls from the sleek button. Her perfecting attire radiates with a dazzling\nenergy amid the dull and hazy lights, and her smile is far brighter than Harry\nrecalls last seeing.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d she exclaims. She walks over\nthe threshold, and takes a step closer to Harry with her arms outstretching for\na hug. \u201cIt\u2019s been a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSophia,\u201d Harry greets her. He\nallows her to pull him in for a reuniting embrace, patting her back in a gently\nand amiable manner. \u201cLovely to see you.\u201d</p><p>Though his voice is monotone, he is\nhonest with his words. It is a surprise to see Sophia on this strange night,\nbut she has always been a delight to him and those around her. He begins to\nfeel better about the crowd that this party will bring, but a startling notion\ntwirls in the field of his flower-mind. Sophia pulls away, delivers a\nmillion-dollar smile, and strolls over to greet Jeff, who she is also an\nacquaintance of. The elevator doors begin to push together, and Harry lets out\na sigh of relief for what he believes will be a smooth night from here on out.</p><p>\u201cWait! Sasha!\u201d someone calls out\nfrom the hallway, their footsteps patter against the carpet floors. A manicured\nhand reaches out to the narrow space left between the closing doors. Harry\u2019s\neyes bulge out of his head, but he is quick to act upon the situation unlike\nthe three mindless bystanders. He reaches out to wave his hand in front of the\ndoors while simultaneously pushing the button that keeps them open. Sasha, on\nthe other hand, stands unbothered in his corner, smart phone in hand. He looks\nup in time to see the doors opening once again, but fails to catch the\nincredulous gaze shared between two long-lost friends.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Sasha mumbles, and returns\nto his device.\u00a0</p><p>Time ticks away, and the stare\nlingers on, but Harry feels the universe falter in its continuous lifetime.\nHaving her in the flesh reminds him of his hopeless attempts, and in one frail\nsecond, their paths intersect for one painfully perfect moment. It scares him\nthen of what she will do, and in this confined box with four other people, he\nwishes to be alone. One look at her eyes \u2013 once leaking in pain; one look at\nher cheeks \u2013 once staining in melancholy tears; one look at her and he\nremembers how it had felt to see her walk away.</p><p>Despite his fears, he does not\nanticipate a smile. An authentic smile reaching to her sparkling eyes that\ndisguise behind layers of beauty products to accentuate her marvelous attire.\nEven so, there is no difference in how his eyes perceive her. Whether she is in\na glamorous element or spilling her secrets through sobs, his entire heart\nbelongs to her. His heart that fluctuates with emotions momentarily settles on\njust one. Before he can return the kind gesture, before he can exhale with\ncontent and glee, her arms pull him in by the shoulders. She wraps herself softly\naround his frame, and her scent is the most divine, but he can only bask in it\nfor a second before associating it with the torture he knows all too well.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHi, Harry,\u201d she says, and faintly\nnuzzles her chin in the crook of his neck. \u201cHaven\u2019t heard from you in a while.\u201d</p><p>Harry stiffens. Over her shoulder,\nhe can see the doors closing for a final time. He can hear the other three in\ntheir own conversation. He can feel her warm breath sending twisters down his\nspine. It is over her shoulder that the color of the world shifts to gray. She\nhas not heard from him in a while, but he calls her at least once every week.\nTry as he might, he cannot forget her, and so he reaches out with hope that\nevery call will be the one she finally answers.</p><p>Her grip eases, though Harry\u2019s arms\nhave long fallen from her waist. She pulls away, and peers up at him with\ncaution in her eyes. Her smile paints a completely different picture. \u201cHow\u2019ve\nyou been?\u201d she asks, purses her lips. Her casual behavior makes him sad, and if\nhe isn\u2019t mistaken, she looks to be begging him to stay quiet; she\u2019s begging him\nto not start something tonight that is unfinished from months ago.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d he mumbles, but the answer\ncarries more significance than he lets on. She goes to stand by Sasha, but he\nrecalls his messages; he recalls how on her end, the decline button saves her.\nThe option to mute his conversation is a gift. Clearing her voicemail box is\nlifting a weight that she had never wanted on her shoulders. Her solution is to\npretend. She does as his first voicemail had asked her and pretends that the\nsecret night of confessions had never happened. She somehow pushes that memory\naway and pretends that everything is fine in their broken friendship.</p><p>She pretends that his love does not\nexist, and that is the greatest pain of all.\u00a0</p><p>The ride up the remaining floors is\nuncomfortable for him, especially when he realizes that the trio are going to\nthe same party that he is. Where Jeff mingles in a short conversation with\nSophia and Sasha \u2013 who Harry now remembers seeing in one of y/n\u2019s Instagram\nposts \u2013 the younger man stands in his isolation by the keypad. He starts to\ndoubt that she is in love with him too. He wishes for her to spare him a\nglance; he wants to see the weakness in her frown. He cannot fathom how it is\npossible to stay away from the person that has one\u2019s heart, or even act as\nthough they barely exist. If he is to see that weakness, that pouty little\nexpression, <i>then</i> he will know if she\ntruly loves him too.</p><p>It feels like lifetimes before the\nelevator doors open to a floor that drowns in music. Sasha is the first of the\ntrio to step out, sashaying as he opens up Snapchat on his phone with a single\nhand. Harry reminisces a time when his younger self had grown fond of Twitter.\nWith a harsh push under the spotlight, he\u2019s since then snapped out of the\nsocial network daze and has learned a great deal of restraint. It is that\nrestraint that has kept him from checking up on y/n\u2019s profiles in those lonely\nfew months, but he wonders if he had taken the chance to peak, would he have\nknown about her appearance tonight?</p><p>\u201cNice catching up, Jeff,\u201d Sophia\nsays. She links her arm with y/n\u2019s, helping her friend out the elevator since\nshe can\u2019t find it within herself to look up. As they pass by Harry, Sophia\nturns her head and sends him a nod and a smirk, which is far more attention\nthan y/n has given him in the past few months.</p><p>Harry smiles politely and allows\nthe two women to scurry away before trailing far behind them. He steps out onto\nthe floor, Jeff right on his tail, and the sea of beautiful faces begin to gawk\nat the legend before them. \u201cDid you know that y/n would be here?\u201d Harry asks, aware\nthat the madness will soon mask his voice.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Jeff answers, but tilts his\nhead at the question. \u201cI figured between the two of us, you would have been the\none to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike she said,\u201d Harry replies,\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a while.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>After the so-called falling out,\nHarry had refused to talk about it with anyone. It isn\u2019t as if what had\nhappened embarrasses him, or that he falls in line with the other men who find\nit <i>un-masculine</i> to speak openly about\ntheir feelings. He doesn\u2019t associate expressing emotions to be masculine or\nfeminine; it is a human quality, a necessity and a treasure. The situation is\njust far too delicate for him. Y/n is a fragment belonging to a rare batch of\npeople that he trusts; the world is sometimes so cruel and unkind, and y/n is\nthe uniqueness that makes it worthwhile. Above anything, she is his friend, and\nhe will suffer through that title than to not have her at all. The only person\nthat he tells this to, is his mother.</p><p>\u201cI figured Sophia would be here,\u201d\nJeff says as they near the room that hosts the party. Harry gives him a\nquizzical look, silent for an explanation. \u201cShe endorses a lot of companies on\nher Instagram. This is like a party and a business deal for her.\u201d</p><p>Of course. This new generation of\nnetworking supports a numerous amount of careers, ones that cannot exist\nwithout the thing he avoids the most. Sophia has an impressive following, so it\nmakes sense for her to be an attendee at this precious little soiree. With her\nand y/n practically attached at the hip, Harry understands how y/n manages to\nstick herself in a strange combination of people. She herself views her life as\nsimilar as the next average human being struggling for survival. She is a\nperson who shops in the sale section, dines at McDonald\u2019s, and pays her rent\nlate every now and then; the lavishing lifestyle is not her safe space.</p><p>Even so, she takes part in an\ninteresting act. Her compliance to a night full of hype and hysteria, flashing\ncameras and mindful eyes \u2013 it is not who she is, but she portrays the role very\nwell. She walks into the party, grinning at the other guests, though Harry has\na deep instinctive feeling that she now wants nothing more than to go back\nhome.</p><p>An hour passes and Harry has\nsuccessfully mingled with his friends, even going so far as to indulge in\nentertaining conversations with new faces. He doesn\u2019t know it until he is\ndowning his third glass, but the tequila has been rather inviting. He should\ndetest the burning taste; it is partially to blame for his impulsion on <i>that</i> night, and the voicemail that had\nled him to a slippery slope of solitude. So <i>damn\nthe tequila</i>, he says to himself, glaring at the innocent drink, but <i>damn,</i> the tequila resembles a craving\nthat he has been missing. It feels so strangely smooth running down his pretty\nthroat, and he feels it electrifying his veins.\u00a0</p><p>Another hour passes. He giggles\nmore often than usual. People come up to him to take pictures \u2013 praising him\nand flaunting his name \u2013 and he sticks his wild tongue out in almost all of\nthem. He grows affectionate and clings to his friends, but <i>only</i> his friends. He cannot find the person that he really wants to\ncuddle. He\u2019s not even sure if she\u2019s still at the party, but frankly, he doesn\u2019t\ncare. This is his night, and he wants to spend it in a hazy cloud of illusions,\ndrowning in the purple lights and blaring music.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d Jeff tugs at his shoulder.\nHarry sits on a stool in front of the bar, and his friend swivels his chair in\nhis direction. His sudden contact startles Harry, but he relaxes when he sees\nthe face of a man he heavily relies on. \u201cAre you ready to go?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Harry smiles. His lips fold tightly\ntogether, his flush face exposing his current state of mind. \u201cNot yet.\u201d He\nshakes his head. He swivels his chair back to the front, calls the bartender\nover so that he can order him and his bestest best friend \u2013 <i>don\u2019t tell Mitch </i>\u2013 a persuasive shot.</p><p>\u201cNot for me,\u201d Jeff declines, waving\nhis hand horizontally in a slicing motion across his throat. \u201cAnd honestly, you\nshould consider holding back too.\u201d</p><p>Harry can barely hear his voice\nover the music and overlapping conversations. Still, he makes out the general\ndetails, and something about his words have Harry gushing at his friend. He\ngrins up at him, dimples and all, and guides his heavy arms over Jeff\u2019s\nshoulders. \u201cAh, you\u2019re so caring, you little\u2014\u201d Harry finishes his sentence with\na growl, attacking his friend\u2019s closest cheek by taking a playful bite between\nhis pearly teeth. \u201cVery caring, you are. I\u2019m fine, I swear. I\u2019m having a good\ntime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes! It\u2019s a party, Jeffery! Go out\nand enjoy yourself.\u201d</p><p>Despite his encouragement, Jeff\ntakes a seat on the stool next to Harry and keeps him company. He stays for his\nfriend, who he knows is a bit of an impulsive drunk, and also someone that\nrelishes in camaraderie. It is also more challenging, Jeff says, for the pesky\nstrangers and tag-alongs to come up to Harry when he is already in a private conversation\nwith his manager. Therefore, the friends talk, and they laugh, and one has to\nkeep the other from losing all of his brain cells. It is a nice pattern that\nensues for half an hour until Jeff announces that he needs to use the restroom.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be right back,\u201d he says into\nHarry\u2019s ear, two hands pat his shoulders before he is off on his quest. While\nhe has fair intentions, Harry knows that he will not <i>be right back.</i> He will spend some time actually looking for the\ntoilets, squirm through tightly packed bodies both stationary and in rhythmic\nmotion. At an event like this, there is also surely to be a line. Then to\nsquirm his way back \u2013 it will be some time before he returns, which means that\nfor some time, Harry will be alone. Right now, Harry alone is a very dangerous\ncircumstance.</p><p>His first mistake is to order\nanother shot. A shot of what exactly, he\u2019s not too sure, but if it\u2019s the damned\ntequila then his mistake is much graver than he anticipates. His second mistake\nis to notice the hard, solid item in the back pocket of his trousers. It starts\nto bother him, especially with the seating position that he is in. He pulls the\ndevice out, and glares at how comfortably it fits in his right hand. His third\nmistake \u2013 oh, he certainty fears his third. A devious and curious thought\nflashes with warning, but before he can stop himself, he unlocks his phone and\npulls up the Instagram app. Notifications begin to pop up as they normally do,\nand sometimes it is difficult to wrap his head around the large numbers.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t go on now to gawk at the\nnumbers or scroll through his feed. He taps on the search bar, thumbs hesitant\nfor a second before typing away at the keyboard until her familiar handle\nappears. It has been months since he\u2019s seen her profile, even before his visit\nto her apartment. Her biography is simple and sweet, her profile photo is a\ntrue depiction of who she is. Her posts are a combination of snapshots, from\nmirror selfies to remarkable scenery to fun nights to memes, memes, and memes.\nAll of it is boldly her, but her most recent post captivates his attention.\u00a0</p><p>He clicks on the slightly edited\npicture to enlarge the two women who pose together. Taken from the waist up,\nthe duo flashes similar seductive expressions at the camera. Sophia\u2019s body faces\nforward, her head tilts to accentuate her jawline, and a wine glass hangs from\nher fingertips. Y/n positions herself sideways, her back presses against\nSophia\u2019s arm, and her head aligns to her propped shoulder. Her features are\npudgier than Sophia\u2019s, her face not as defined, and her attire much less\nluxurious. To him, she glows amid the bustling bodies frozen in the background\nof their moment.</p><p>Her caption consists of a few\nplayful emoji\u2019s, another thing he isn\u2019t too fond of, but their innocence and liveliness\nin graphic and color makes him smile. If he remembers correctly, she doesn\u2019t\nmiss an opportunity to insert a clever caption, so he can imagine her\nfrustration at this party. He envisions her picking at her brain for the least\nbit of intellect left, cursing at people\u2019s buffoonery and celebration, but\nultimately deciding on the series of vague emoji\u2019s. She posts it an hour ago,\nominous without a location tag as the background does not give too much away.\nHe doesn\u2019t know if this means that she still breathes in the festivities or if\nit is her goodnight to the world before she hops on her flight back home.</p><p>\u201cHaving a good time?\u201d a loud voice\nshouts into ear, grips his left shoulder, and lets their hand hang from the\nfirm crevice of his warm neck.</p><p>Harry nearly drops his phone\nface-down on the wet laminate surface of the bar. His heart races as he makes a\nquick and sly move to lock his phone, the screen turns black mid-jolt of surprise.\nHe swerves to his right side to meet with his intruder, and discovers a pair of\nrecognizable piercing eyes. They\u2019re cordial in their own sense, but the\nintimidation that laces somewhere beneath her irises is unmistakable. He\nresponds to her with a polite smile and nonchalant nod, which for her is enough\nof an invitation to pull up the empty stool next to him and stay. His attention\ndoesn\u2019t remain on her for too long, because after he acknowledges her presence,\nhe faces forward again with the desire to submerge himself in another drink.</p><p>\u201cIt was a struggle to get to you,\u201d\nSophia remarks, one pant-clad leg crosses over the other. A manicured hand\nwhirls in the storm of her luscious locks, and her stilettos droop from the\nfirm shape of her feet with only a mere strap keeping them intact. \u201cI had a\ntussle with about three other people to get here.\u201d</p><p>At this, Harry laughs. His\nshoulders shake, his eyes squint, and his tiny tongue sticks out between his\nteeth. \u201cI\u2019m sure you really ruffed them up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah.\u201d Sophia smiles. \u201cYou sure\nare loved.\u201d</p><p>She means it endearingly \u2013 not in\nthe kiss-ass manner that many people do to him tonight, but with fair\nintentions of bringing comfort to an otherwise lonesome man. Either way, Harry\ndelivers a sad smile to the tabletop. His hands fidget with each other, and\nthen gravitates another one of his ordered drinks to him. He spins the glass\nwith his calloused fingers, watches the liquid slosh around in its crystalline\nconfinement.</p><p> \u201cNot by everyone,\u201d he says, clutches his\nglass, and raises it to his pink and swollen lips. He tilts his head back, downing\nthe contents as his eyes flutter shut. Sophia is in his peripheral vision, and\nshe watches him with a sincere, sympathetic look. Such a pity party he is, and\nit is usually at this low point that he decides to call it a night, rest his\nintoxicating thoughts, and suffer with vile regret in the late morning.</p><p>What stops\nhim tonight is Sophia\u2019s sweet and simple look that informs him of a simple\ntruth: she knows. No matter how much she succeeds in ignoring his texts, and\nhis calls, and his voicemails, y/n\u2019s tongue speaks his name after that final\ngoodnight. It contorts and curls and flattens with an elaboration of their card\ngame with a twist, and perhaps even licks away at the salty sensation of her\nrecollection. He\u2019s suspicious to the idea that perhaps this isn\u2019t as easy for\nher as he believes. She cannot push his memory beyond existence until it is\nnothing but a ghost filling her lungs with smoke; she suffers just as he does.<br></p><p>\u201cDoes she\ntalk about me?\u201d Harry wonders aloud, sets his glass down with a harsh <i>clink!</i> He turns to Sophia, who already\nhas an impressively fierce look in her eyes, one eyebrow creating an arch to\ncompete against his inquiry.<br></p><p>\u201cWho does?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cRight,\nlet\u2019s skip the part where you pretend that y/n hasn\u2019t told you.\u201d<br></p><p>Sophia\ndoesn\u2019t waver. She narrows her eyes, a test to Harry to see how long she can\ndrag out her charade. It is an intense stare-down on her end, but the charming\nman does not give into her antics. His face sags, not necessarily into a frown,\nbut rather a worn-out mien that has been through a fair share of\ndisappointment.<br></p><p>He wins at\nher sigh of defeat, the pout in her lips replacing her once confident\nimpression. To say the least, his reward is not rewarding. \u201cNot really,\u201d Sophia\nhesitantly answers, \u201cbut she wants to! I think. At least for your sake, I hope\nshe does.\u201d<br></p><p>Harry\nscoffs, but nods his head repetitively to sink down the information that cannot\nprocess with the empty glass he holds. He knows what she refers to when she\nsays for <i>his</i> sake: he is a complete\nmess without her, barely subdues his sorrows with his need for poison, fails to\nforget her. She cannot be more wrong. He doesn\u2019t need her. His life in the past\ncouple of months have flown with ease, with happiness and health. If anything,\nhis lack of communication with her distracts him less from the truest and most\nhonest love of his life: his music. Y/n does not meet the criteria that is\nnecessary for his complex existence. He does not need her.</p><p>\u201cSo, she\u2019s\nblocking me out,\u201d Harry concludes, blinks away the dizziness and polychromatic\ndots that float across his vision like butterflies. He knows that she\u2019s been\nignoring him, that much is obvious \u2013 but to block him out? To hide him away in\na place of her confusing brain that she cannot possibly reach? That is nearly\nimpossible.<br></p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s\ngoing on with her life. I think maybe you should consider doing that too.\u201d<br></p><p>Harry sends\nher an incredulous look. \u201cMe? What do you think I\u2019ve been doing? Sitting around\nhere, waiting for her call?\u201d<br></p><p>Sophia\nreplies with a mocking expression. It is enough for him to recall the last\nvoicemail he had sent before boarding the plane to a new life without her.<br></p><p>\u201cJesus,\u201d\nHarry grumbles. \u201cSo much for not talking about me.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cHarry,\nplease. I\u2019m not here to be hostile.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cEnlighten\nme then, Soph. After all, you did tussle with three other people to get here.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a\nclass act, Styles.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cDid she\nsend you or something? To tell me to piss off?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cNo! If she\nwanted you to piss off, she would tell you herself.\u201d<br></p><p>Harry stays\nsilent, as silent as he can possibly be in this bizarre setting. He fixes his\nattention on Sophia, who has caution in her eyes, similar to a child caught\nwith their hand in the cookie jar. He searches her intensely, wonders if he\nhears her correctly, or if his surmise is far off from what she really means.\n\u201cWhy doesn\u2019t she then?\u201d he asks, the words play over like a tragic symphony. He\npleas for an answer, almost whining with child-like eyes glassing over with\npure innocence.<br></p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t\nanswer that for her,\u201d Sophia says, \u201cbut as her friend, I can tell you what I\nthink she deserves.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cIs it me?\u201d<br></p><p>Sophia\npurses her lips, spreads the smooth lipstick over her plump lips. \u201cIt\u2019s not\nthis,\u201d she answers, a hint in her determined voice feeling bad for him. \u201cWhatever\n<i>this</i> actually is. A back-and-forth.\nYou call her, she ignores you. It\u2019s taking a toll on her having to deal with\nthis every week, same as it did that night. I\u2019m not saying that y/n is innocent\nin this, because clearly, she\u2019s not, but she has her reasons. You need to respect\nthem.\u201d<br></p><p>Harry wants\nto cry. He wants to release everything that y/n stores in him: the rage, the\nmourning, the self-pity, the love. The endless, endless love that he doesn\u2019t\never imagine he can have for someone in this whirlwind of a lifetime. It\u2019s become\ntoo much, but he still doesn\u2019t understand how it has come to this. What are her\nreasons? What compels her to stay away from something that can be so bloody\nbrilliant?<br></p><p>\u201cShe\ndoesn\u2019t need to love someone that worries her all the time,\u201d Sophia continues.\nThe heedful filter inside of her runs out, her words confirming to him the\ntruths he\u2019s always known. If she is to do anything for her friend, it is this.\n\u201cShe needs someone who\u2019s there, Harry. I know you want to be, but have you ever\nstopped to consider her side of things?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he\nanswers instantly, breathing out through his mouth. He blinks sluggishly, a\nstrange effect taking over. \u201cShe\u2019s \u2026 she can be\u2026\u201d<br></p><p>Sophia\nwaits for an answer that doesn\u2019t appear. \u201cShe can be a what?\u201d<br></p><p><i>Loved.</i> She can be loved by anyone, and\nanyone who is lucky enough to make her heart happy should be enough for him.\nBut it isn\u2019t. It isn\u2019t, because he is selfish, and he loves her too much to let\nthis be the end of it. She can be loved by anyone, but she will find something\neternal that is worth the heartache if she is to be loved by him.<br></p><p>\u201cShe can be\nwith me,\u201d Harry slurs, a hiccup raking through his body. He looks pathetic, he\nknows he does, but none of it matters. Whatever happens tomorrow doesn\u2019t matter\nif tonight means nothing.<br></p><p>Sophia\nshakes her head. She uncrosses a leg and stretches it out onto the sweaty\ndancefloor. She adjusts her outfit, rakes a hand through her hair, and points a\nlazy finger at Harry. \u201cThat is not for you to decide,\u201d she tells him, and\nshakes her head again as a proper farewell. Her legs only carry her so far\nbefore Harry\u2019s calling back at her.<br></p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d he\nshouts, audible to her, but deaf to the drunks surrounding them. Sophia whirls\naround, stands tall in her place as bodies mistakenly push into her. \u201cThis\nisn\u2019t for <i>you</i> to decide! I\u2019m sorry,\nSophia, but this concerns me and this concerns y/n. <i>No </i>one else.\u201d Harry stands to his feet, the glass in his hands serving\nno purpose but to fuel his veins prior to his assertive nature taking over. He\nrotates his head in every direction, moving mindlessly through the storming\ncrowd as Sophia begins to hold him back.<br></p><p>\u201cWhat are\nyou\u2014\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWhere is\nshe?\u201d he demands, swivels his way around her as he would with a pesky tree in\nhis path. \u201cWe need to talk.\u201d<br></p><p><i>\u201cNo!\u201d</i> Sophia reprimands, using all of\nher might to pull him back by the eager arm. She leans back on her stilettos,\nbut he practically drags her across the floor. To any onlooker, the interaction\nappears as harmless as two friends having a playful laugh. \u201cNo, you are not!\nDon\u2019t even think about it, fucker!\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cFoul\nmouth, Sophia.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t\na game! You can\u2019t just press pause and resume as if it doesn\u2019t affect anyone\nelse! Think about <i>her</i> for once!\u201d</p><p>Harry comes\nto a halt. Sophia\u2019s body rams into his back, she huffs but refuses to let go of\nher hold on his arm. She doesn\u2019t strike a chord in him with her words, nor does\nshe persuade him to back off. In reality, the world around him comes to a stop.\nNo one else matters, whether they are gawking at him or serving him no\nattention. She stands there, in the midst of all the chaos, and her universe\ncollides with his for a single, mere moment. She gapes at him, and her limbs\nfreeze, and whatever Sasha is yelling into one ear goes out the other. He is\ndeaf to the music, blind to the lights, and he cannot feel anything but the\nbeat of his aching heart.<br></p><p>\u201cI think\nabout her all the time,\u201d he says in a hushed tone, a mantra that he recites,\nassuring him of his affection. No one else hears his special words, but maybe\ny/n focuses on him long enough to read his quivering lips. He does not know; she\nis a statue in her own world, a piece of art that he admires and displays to\nthe mass for all of her beauties, but at the end of the day, she is his. She is\na separate entity of pure magic, but she belongs to him, and he gives up\neverything to have her.<br></p><p>Harry\ncontinues his walk, which worries Sophia as she starts tugging him back again.\nThe closer he gets to y/n, the more his stomach squirms and twists and flips.\nHe does, however, find ease in slipping through the crowd; it feels as if they\npart for him, relishing in the cinematic moment that is to take place with a\nfew more meager steps. When he does eventually reach her, he finds himself\nfrowning, because she cannot bear to look him in the eyes. She searches the\nrumbling floor, closing in on herself as if to disappear.<br></p><p>\u201cI miss\nyou,\u201d Harry says, and he somehow finds the strength to overpower the music that\nis disparate to this specific point in time. \u201cLook at me,\u201d he demands of her,\nbut dares not to touch her fragile cocoon. \u201cY/n, please.\u201d His voice wavers,\nweak and damaged, reaching out to her even if she does not want him to.<br></p><p>Sasha darts\nhis eyes between the two friends, or lovers \u2013 he\u2019s not quite sure. \u201cWhat\u2019s\ngoing on?\u201d he asks, oblivious to y/n\u2019s lack of comfort, and the manner in which\nher systems fail to save her. She feels the familiar burn in her nose,\nremembers the last time Harry had begun a sentence with <i>I</i> and had ended it with <i>you.</i>\nIt hits her in a single slap of a moment, time quite irrelevant as the tears\nstart to break apart from her soft eyes.<br></p><p>She can\u2019t be here, so she does the\nlittle something that he haunts himself with every day, and the image of her\nwalking away for a second time has his knees growing weak, almost failing to\nsupport the gravity of her response. Yet, he keeps his ground. He watches the\nlittle shake of her head, though he doesn\u2019t know how she can disagree with his\ncertainty, and watches her legs carry her to the hallway outside of the party.\nIt is only this time that he refuses to let her go; he refuses to stand by and\nfeel sorry for himself, left to wonder where it had all gone wrong.</p><p>He follows\nher out; the yellow lights of the hallway and the sudden expanse of vacancy\ncauses a disturbance to his movements. He feels as if he is floating in\nmid-air, swimming to her, who is an albatross flying miles and miles above him.\n\u201cStop!\u201d he calls out, and the few who meander outside of the party turn their\nheads to find the source of outburst.<br></p><p>She doesn\u2019t\nstop, but he can see the flinch in her body at his command. Her legs carry her\nas fast as they are able to in the elevated footwear she sports, jewelry\njingling against each other, footsteps scrapping against the carpet floors. He\nhas no choice but to accelerate onward, using his advantage of comfortable\nshoes to match her speed until he surpasses her in the chase, turns on his\nheels, and blocks her open-ended path.<br></p><p>His words\nspeed out from his tongue, \u201cstop, stop, stop!\u201d His hands are on her shoulders\nnow, covered in the softest cloth he\u2019s ever known. \u201cIf you could please just\nstop and listen and talk to me\u2014\u201d<br></p><p><i>\u201cNo,\u201d</i> she croaks out, still rebuffing\nany eye-contact. Her arms poke out, pushing him away, but he is firm in his\nplace. With a final attempt, she musters up her remnants of energy and gives\nhim a solid shove, a forceful one that pushes her back from him until a space\nopens up between them.</p><p>Harry gapes\nat her. His eyebrows knit in shock, his mouth ajar as the words are suddenly\nlost. She stands in front of him with dejection pouring down and outlining the\nshape of her shrunken face. There is still no eye contact between them, but y/n\nfinally does not walk away. Her breaths are ragged, the walls feel as though\nthey\u2019re closing in. She nibbles on the inside of her cheek, and nervously\nwiggles her fingers down by her side.<br></p><p>\u201cWhy are\nyou doin\u2019 this?\u201d he asks, hands prop on his hips. He has to know. If all else\ngoes wrong, if it really is the end, then he has to know why.<br></p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t\nwant to do this right now.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cAlright,\nthen when? Because you certainly didn\u2019t want to talk about it two months ago,\nor any time I tried to reach you thereafter. Not even a descent message to let\nme know if you were even okay.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cMaybe\nbecause it wasn\u2019t any of your business!\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cThe hell it\nisn\u2019t! Tell me how you could be so stubborn to think that? Tell me how it\ndoesn\u2019t concern me at all\u2014\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cBecause\nthere is no <i>it</i>, Harry!\u201d y/n seethes,\nand lets out a teary scoff. \u201cThere is no <i>it</i>\nthat we have to talk about. It\u2019s not \u2013 it doesn\u2019t\u2026\u201d She doesn\u2019t notice it,\nbut she\u2019s practically in his face now. Looking into his eyes, the glimmer that\nshe admires is gone. She exhales a sigh, and lets her frustration simmer down\nbefore finishing her thought. \u201cIt\u2019s not there. It never had been.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not\ntrue,\u201d Harry disagrees, quick with the shake of his head. \u201cPlease, y/n, after\nall of this, you should know that\u2019s not true.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not in\nlove\u2014\u201d<br></p><p><i>\u201cDon\u2019t.</i>\u201d Harry leans in closer and\nwhispers. \u201cDon\u2019t try to push me away. You know there\u2019s something there because\neven if you feel nothing for me, even if it\u2019s only me and I\u2019m an idiot to be in\nlove with someone that doesn\u2019t love me back, it\u2019s still true. I\u2019m in love with\nyou, and that\u2019s still something.\u201d<br></p><p>With his\nhead tilting down to confess in her ear, y/n\u2019s eyes focus on the rolls of his\nneck to which a silver chain kisses and a blanket of warm skin hugs. It is so\neasy to fall into his words. So easy to bury herself in his embrace, to feel\nthe electric pull of his entire being. So, so easy.<br></p><p>\u201cSo, tell\nme again,\u201d he says, a soothing turn to the treacherous ambience that bubbles\nthem in, away from the world outside. \u201cTell me that you\u2019re not in love with me,\nbut don\u2019t try to tell me how I feel about you. Because it\u2019s always been you,\ny/n.\u201d<br></p><p>Y/n\u2019s lips\nwrinkle, a prominent pout that portrays the weakness he had once wanted to see.\nNow that his eyes sparkle over them so clearly, he wants nothing more than to\nwash her fragility away. \u201cNot always,\u201d she mumbles, her mouth moving to the\nside of her face. In consequence of that forms a smile, but there is nothing\nhumorous in the gesture. It\u2019s sad, frightfully so, as if she sees herself as\nnothing but a joke. \u201cIt\u2019s always been someone else. You know that. Even if in\nthe back of your mind you were thinking of me, you were with someone else. You\nmight think that everything you\u2019re saying is true, but I was never entirely\nyours. I knew that from the start.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cNo,\nthat\u2019s\u2026\u201d Harry shakes his head. He makes a bold decision to reach a single\nhand up \u2013 the left one, with his inked cross swaying back and forth to the\ncalming rhythm that she admires \u2013 and cups the side of her face in a graceful\nmanner. His touch hovers over her wet skin, and it hurts to know that it is his\ndoing. \u201cThat\u2019s entirely different, y/n.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cMaybe for\nyou.\u201d She shrugs. \u201cBut not to me. Not in my eyes.\u201d<br></p><p>What can he\nsay? It isn\u2019t as if he can convince her that her perspective is otherwise \u2013 he\nhas to validate these feelings. He has to understand her reasoning, or else he\nis right back where he had started.<br></p><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d\nHe nods, caressing a single thumb over her cheek. He savors the moment; the\nscent that he inhales is intoxicatingly addictive. He doesn\u2019t know when it will\nend, or when will be the last time he can breathe her in like this, so close\ntogether. \u201cI can\u2019t change that. I can\u2019t change how you viewed everything, and\nit\u2019s my fault that you even had to see it that way at all. I\u2019m to blame, and I\nknow that.\u201d<br></p><p>Y/n shakes\nher head. \u201cIt\u2019s not about pointing fingers, Harry.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI know. I\nknow it\u2019s not, but it\u2019s a start.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA start to\nwhat?\u201d y/n asks exasperatedly. She searches for something in him, but he\u2019s not\nsure of what exactly. An answer? A defeat? A silence that cannot possibly solve\nany of her inquiries and fears?<br></p><p>\u201cA start to\nwhatever the hell this is,\u201d Harry answers without a stutter in his voice. \u201cMe\nfiguring out how to prove to you that it <i>has</i>\nalways been you, and how I fear that it always <i>will </i>be you. That\u2019s not healthy, y/n, in a world of billions and\nonly being moved by one. If I have to spend the rest of my life proving myself\nto you, I won\u2019t hesitate to do it. Even if you don\u2019t want me, which I\u2019m sorry\nto say, but I\u2019m pretty sure we\u2019ve already found out is not the case.\u201d<br></p><p>Y/n softly chuckles, and it is\nthen he notices that her tears no longer flow. It is progress, and it has been\na struggle to get here. \u201cYou won\u2019t be able to,\u201d she says. \u201cI know my worth, but\nthat doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t tear myself apart sometimes. <i>You</i> don\u2019t make that any easier and the worst part is that it\u2019s not\neven your fault. You can\u2019t stop the rest of the world from loving you, so <i>I\u2019m</i> sorry to say that you won\u2019t be able\nto convince me of anything otherwise.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI beg to\ndiffer.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t\ncare.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t\nI just try?\u201d he asks, and this time his other hand follows. He has her entire\nface in his hold, and she looks so precious standing here, her faces squishes,\nher pouty but kissable lips. \u201cYou say that I don\u2019t make it easier, but you\nhaven\u2019t even tried to see if maybe it\u2019s not as hard as you think.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cBecause I\nknow myself better than anyone, Harry. Sometimes, I even know you better than\nyou know yourself. I envision your future and how everything will turn out, and\nI worry over things that don\u2019t even concern me. I live your life in ways that\nyou haven\u2019t even dreamed about and I understand your little catchphrases and\nyour antics. I do it all for you, because someone has to, and I don\u2019t know why\nit has to be, but it is. I do that for you, so pardon me if I already have an\nidea of how hellish this could turn out.\u201d<br></p><p>When y/n\nlooks up at Harry, she sees a wavering light that flickers with stardust. His\nuniverse has never looked lovelier, but it also has a strangeness to it that\nshe is not familiar with. Her little rant ends on a negative note, so she\ndoesn\u2019t know why he stares at her as though she is the first existence he has\never known.<br></p><p>\u201cGod, I\u2019m\nso in love with you,\u201d He declares, and he doesn\u2019t give her any time to process\nbefore he has his mouth over hers. It is inviting, to feel the shape that fits\nso well with his. <i>This</i> is the crave\nthat he has been missing, this sudden wild flare of emotions, and though it is\nnot perfect, it is more than enough for him.<br></p><p>Y/n mumbles\nagainst his lips, though he doesn\u2019t miss the fact that she pulls him in as much\nhe does to her. Her hand has found his waist, but her pesky lips keep mumbling,\nbreaking apart the contact that he wishes to endure for the rest of his life.\n\u201cNo, this is a bad idea,\u201d she speaks into his lips, the same hand on his waist\nnow faintly pushing him away.<br></p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s\nnot,\u201d he kisses back.<br></p><p>\u201cMm-mmm.\u201d\ny/n shakes her head. Their lips pull away, and when they do, she notices the\ntransfer of her lipstick onto his mouth. \u201cThis is,\u201d she pauses, and lets out a\nlaughing huff, \u201cthis is not going to work out at all.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWhy do you\nkeep saying that?\u201d he asks, his hands travel down to her shoulders. He rubs\nagainst them, then slithers his way down to her upper back. It is much harder\nfor her to escape him now. \u201cWhy can\u2019t you allow yourself this? You daydream\nabout the future but none of it matters because try as you might, you\u2019ll never\nreally know how amazing this can be.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cIt can\u2019t\nbe so amazing.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWhy bloody\nnot?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cBecause\nyou said so yourself!\u201d she exclaims, and he opens his mouth to retaliate, but\nshe beats him to the mark. \u201cYou might not have said it exactly, but you definitely\nsaid it. You said that this is your life and you can\u2019t slow down and that it\u2019s\ndifferent for you! As far as I\u2019m concerned, that doesn\u2019t sound so amazing. You\u2019re\nin the clouds now, Harry, and you\u2019re going to reach galaxies you\u2019ve never even\nimagined. From down on the ground, it looks like you\u2019re never going to stop,\nand you won\u2019t. You can\u2019t. Not even for the person that you\u2019re in love with.\u201d<br></p><p>Her words\nare fairly blunt, but Harry recalls their conversation. His single confession\nto her only play of a wild card, a distant memory that can properly place\nitself into another dimension. That night, they had not been happy. They had\nbeen foolish, going about the situation in all the wrong ways, because the\nsilence has never been their friend. Between them, there is never an absence,\nnever a stillness in the air. It has always been just them, the way they\ninteract with each other, whether it is a surplus of verbal words or\nconversations through their looks and gestures. They had been missing that\ntreasure on that cursed night, and neither of them were attentive enough to\nrealize it.<br></p><p>Harry\nsmiles at her. His dimple is prominent, and she has to keep herself from\nswooning at the close sight of it. \u201cYou don\u2019t know,\u201d he says, joy laces in his\ntone. She tilts her head in a quizzical manner: <i>know what?</i> she asks with her stare, the silence never prevailing. \u201cYou\ndon\u2019t know how everything looks like through my eyes. When I see you, and the\nworld gets hazy, and I can\u2019t hear or feel anything. My heart turns into\nsomething else, something I can\u2019t explain. I don\u2019t understand how when I\u2019m with\nyou, time just \u2026 stops. Everything stops for you.\u201d<br></p><p>Harry pulls\nher in slowly, their foreheads brushing as their noses crinkle against each\nother. \u201cI promise,\u201d he whispers, nudging at her so that she can welcome her\nsweet lips to his. \u201cEverything stops for you,\u201d he repeats, and connects their\nlips for a third time, and each one holds something different, something unexplainably\nspecial. He wants to say more, to further prove himself, and prove how well\ntheir love can be. He can\u2019t though, because her lips press against his, her\nhands wrap around him, and she lets herself fall in love with everything he is\nand everything he has to give.<br></p><p>After a\nshort lip-locking moment \u2013 where not much privacy ensues, and he tries not to\nmind whatever pictures surface the next morning \u2013 their movements become a\nlittle sloppier, and Harry has the devilish urge to bite on her swollen lip. He\npulls at it between his cheeky grin, which gets a grimacing smile out of her as\nthey separate. He can\u2019t control the flutter of laughter that escapes him,\nattacking her with a chaste kiss on her cheek before whispering in her ear. \u201cHey,\nif you\u2019re up for it, we can try out that kink of yours now.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cUgh.\u201d Y/n\nrolls her eyes, then reaches up to twist his nipple through his button-up. \u201cSuch\na gentleman you are.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cOw!\u201d he\nyelps, giggling as he palms at the sensitive area. \u201cYou didn\u2019t tell me that was\npart of it, cheeky lovie!\u201d</p>",

He does not register the silence until it\nsubmerges the entire apartment. His ears strain to catch even the faintest\nsound on the other side of the door. The painted walls muffle her movements;\nnot a single light shines from the crack at his feet.</p><p>The poor\nman is a blossoming flower; petals of sweetness expand from the force of\nnature&rsquo;s love. He is powerful, but the dirt pulls him to the ground with its\nmuddy hands, and steadies him for the hurricane that is to strike. He cannot\nmove. He stands and relives the events that baffle his brain: she walks away;\nshe dismisses him with a fragile goodnight, a farewell that he fears will be\nthe last; he confesses his secrets and she scrambles with strange abandonment.\nOver a dozen times does he relive those taunting moments, seconds ticking\nfurther and further away.</p><p>This\ndoesn&rsquo;t make the least bit of sense to him. He can imagine it from his\nperspective without strife. He professes his love, and it unveils a grand twist\nto their years-long story. He can taste the sorrow on her lips, a mixture of\nsalt and relief. He can feel the dip in her neck where his eager hands find a\nhome, fingertips pressing with a passion. He can imagine her sweet lips to\nconfess the eight letters that welcome heaven to his heart. When he opens his\neyes, he stares at an empty wall instead. Her presence lingers, but she is not\nhere.&nbsp;</p><p>Harry\ndoesn&rsquo;t make a sound. He doesn&rsquo;t know if she sleeps tenderly under the comfort\nof her sheets &ndash; if exhaustion makes it that much easier for her to rest. He\ndoes not pick apart his brain to imagine, because to imagine her all snug in\nhis shaded arms is too much to bear. Consequently, with the last ounce of\nenergy that he has left, he shakes the desire from his clouded mind, and walks\naway.</p><p><b><i>&gt;Can you please call me back?</i></b><b><i>&nbsp;</i></b></p><p><b><i>&gt;I&rsquo;m sorry if I was pressuring you. It wasn&rsquo;t my intention.</i></b><b><i>&nbsp;</i></b></p><p><b><i>&gt;I leave on the sixth. Can we please talk before then?</i></b></p><p>Messages\nslither their way into Harry&rsquo;s everyday routine. Unanswered calls are a given, and\nhis desperate voicemails are almost therapeutic. His time ticks away, and it\nfills with him an anxiety that no crowd can ever compare with. In the days that\nfollow, he succumbs to self-hatred. He will never forgive himself for ruining\nsomething so special. A fresh sheet once written with loving memories is\nnothing but a smudge of ink, a ball that he crumples with his own bare hands.\nThe wrinkles and creases can never return to their former smooth state,\neternally marking his selfish behavior in the folded lines.</p><p>Four days\ncome and go. He goes longer periods of time without communicating with y/n, but\nthis particular situation has his head spinning off and into the clouds. She\nhas yet to call him back, and he will have to leave soon. His career requires\nhis attention elsewhere, in places that y/n cannot go. Somewhere in his mind,\nhe wonders if that is her plan. Does she count the days, waiting for him to\ndisappear so that <i>finally</i> she can\ntoo?<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;\nHarry asks her. His legs dangle, knees bent at the edge of the hotel bed. His\nbody spreads across the center. One hand covers his face, index finger and\nthumb rubbing harshly against his eyes. The other clutches his phone, and\npresses it against his flaming ear. &ldquo;Why aren&rsquo;t you picking up your phone? You\ncouldn&rsquo;t have thrown it out the window again. Why can&rsquo;t you just call me back\nor send me a message to fuck off? Why do you insist on being so&mdash;&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Harry stops\nhimself. He considers the word on his tongue: <i>annoying.</i> She is being remarkably annoying, impossibly infuriating,\na down-right <i>burden.</i> The worst part\nof it all is that she does nothing. She ignores him and continues to live her\nown separate life, and there really isn&rsquo;t anything she can do to control how\nannoying she&rsquo;s being. In spite of this, there is a beat that his heart reserves\nfor only her.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Just call\nme back. Please. Anything.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>By the time\nthe sixth rolls around, Harry parallels a broken record of apologies and pleas.\nHe considers, in a hopeful part of his mind, that it is her favorite one to\nplay. She does not make any attempts to throw out the vinyl that screams with\ndeep scratches, so she must enjoy the melody of his broken heart and dance in\nhis misery. As cruel as it sounds, he prefers this over the possibility that\nshe simply wishes to wear out the beloved composition until there is nothing\nleft to let go of.<br /></p><p>Chances are\nthat this is why he has not sought out the most obvious of solutions. He knows\nthe route to her apartment, he knows when she is absent and when she is at\nhome. He even knows how to sneak his way in, and though it may be a psychotically\ndrastic turn, it is such an easy game for him to play. The fifty-fifty gamble,\nhowever, is what keeps him from paying her the visit. Cornering her to make a\ndecision &ndash; to love him back or to reject his heart once again &ndash; will give him a\ndefinite answer, and for once, uncertainty is his friend. He savors these\none-sided conversations because then he can imagine her listening on the other\nend. It is better than to know for certain if she does not care for him or his\nheart. It is better to suffer through the fatal chase than to not feel the pain\nat all.<br /></p><p>As he\nboards the plane, he keeps his heart open. As he settles into his private seat,\nhe keeps her words with him. As he feels the runway disappear from beneath him,\nhe holds his phone steady in his hands, and composes his final attempt before\ndreaming in the clouds.&nbsp;<br /></p><p><b><i>&gt;I understand if you don&rsquo;t want to talk to me</i></b></p><p><b><i>&gt;but wherever I&rsquo;ll be, I&rsquo;ll still wait for your call.</i></b></p><p><b>&nbsp;</b>Months pass\nby, and Harry revolves around a vacant world. He visits countries that are rich\nwith beauty. The roads are endless in their mystical magic. He passes strangers\non his journeys, and they tell him of how happy he appears; how genuine his\nsmile perceives. They don&rsquo;t know that he has not spoken to y/n in months, and\nit affects his craft in both a negative and positive way. She does not consume\nhim. He devotes his entirety to her, but his life goes on without her. He is\ncapable of finding humor in small things, distracts himself with the whimsical\nwonders of the world, and spares no thought to the woman who spears his love.&nbsp;</p><p>He is doing fine, and he enjoys\nhimself frequently, but there comes a moment when everything stops. His brain\npeaks at an image of her: she walks away, and it strikes a hollow spark within.\nHe laughs, he listens, he lives &ndash; at the end of the day, she is there, and the\nsullen moments of that night sneak up on him like a killer in the shadows.</p><p>Tonight, he celebrates. Despite his\nextravagant lifestyle, Harry prefers intimate get-togethers to explosive\nevents. He&rsquo;s not one to sell himself to the wealthiest festivities that shower\nhim in praise and flaunt his name. He doesn&rsquo;t need the exploitation, but\ntonight, he tries not to mind it. He steps into the empty elevator and listens\nto the doors close behind him as Jeff presses the button to the party&rsquo;s floor.\nWhile his friend fixes his appearance last minute in the reflective surface of\nthe elevator walls, Harry gazes at the number rising above his head.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not plannin&rsquo; on staying long,&rdquo;\nhe says, observing his own appearance in the reflection. It is nothing too\nlavishing for a company&rsquo;s anniversary party, but it has enough flare to\nproperly mark it as his own style.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m there as long as you are,&rdquo;\nJeff responds. He releases his hands from the collar of his button-up. &ldquo;Are you\ngoing to head back to your hotel room?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Maybe. Although I am in the mood\nfor anything other than late-night television.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>His friend laughs, nodding his head\nin agreement. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re the boss. But try to not get too crazy tonight, you still\nhave emails to respond to the morning, and another meeting over Skype.&rdquo;</p><p>Jeff goes on with his business\ntalk, and Harry isn&rsquo;t too sure about whether he&rsquo;s grateful for this or not.\nIt&rsquo;s nice to indulge into a schedule for the next day, but it is also nice to\nnot worry over the chaos of his career for one night. In the interim of their\ndiscussion, the elevator dings and pauses motion. When Harry looks up, he sees\nthat there are still a few more floors to go, but the sparkling doors open, and\nthe two friends give each other a look.</p><p>A man is the first to enter. He\nshines in a flamboyantly bold outfit, one that is sure to present him with the\nattention that he desires. He flashes a charming smile, presses his palms flat\nagainst the side of the doors, and tilts his head to shout over his shoulder.\n&ldquo;Hurry your asses up or I&rsquo;m going without you!&rdquo;</p><p>The confident man moves himself\ninto the back-right corner, with Harry and Jeff silent against the adjacent\nback wall. An exasperated &ldquo;My god,&rdquo; breathes out from the hallway, faint\nfootsteps rush down the carpet floors. Harry takes a step forward, situating\nhimself near the keypad with a finger pushing down on the button that keeps the\ndoors open. While waiting for the next person to arrive, he takes a quick\nglance at the man in the corner and wonders where he has seen his face before.</p><p>&ldquo;Sasha, you better be holding open\nthe doors!&rdquo; the woman yells, which causes the three men to chuckle with each\nother in time. Harry, however, settles down from the amusement fairly quickly\nas he peruses the familiar voice. He doesn&rsquo;t ponder for long, because sooner\nthan later, the mysterious woman appears by the doors and glares at her friend.\nShe opens her plump lips as if to curse at him, but notices the other two\nentities and shifts her demeanor. &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m sorry, I didn&rsquo;t know&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>The woman pauses her sentence. She\nobserves Harry and Jeff, who she comes to realize are not mere strangers\nhitching for a ride up. Harry feels his heart drop for a short moment, his finger\nfalls from the sleek button. Her perfecting attire radiates with a dazzling\nenergy amid the dull and hazy lights, and her smile is far brighter than Harry\nrecalls last seeing.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey!&rdquo; she exclaims. She walks over\nthe threshold, and takes a step closer to Harry with her arms outstretching for\na hug. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been a while.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sophia,&rdquo; Harry greets her. He\nallows her to pull him in for a reuniting embrace, patting her back in a gently\nand amiable manner. &ldquo;Lovely to see you.&rdquo;</p><p>Though his voice is monotone, he is\nhonest with his words. It is a surprise to see Sophia on this strange night,\nbut she has always been a delight to him and those around her. He begins to\nfeel better about the crowd that this party will bring, but a startling notion\ntwirls in the field of his flower-mind. Sophia pulls away, delivers a\nmillion-dollar smile, and strolls over to greet Jeff, who she is also an\nacquaintance of. The elevator doors begin to push together, and Harry lets out\na sigh of relief for what he believes will be a smooth night from here on out.</p><p>&ldquo;Wait! Sasha!&rdquo; someone calls out\nfrom the hallway, their footsteps patter against the carpet floors. A manicured\nhand reaches out to the narrow space left between the closing doors. Harry&rsquo;s\neyes bulge out of his head, but he is quick to act upon the situation unlike\nthe three mindless bystanders. He reaches out to wave his hand in front of the\ndoors while simultaneously pushing the button that keeps them open. Sasha, on\nthe other hand, stands unbothered in his corner, smart phone in hand. He looks\nup in time to see the doors opening once again, but fails to catch the\nincredulous gaze shared between two long-lost friends.</p><p>&ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; Sasha mumbles, and returns\nto his device.&nbsp;</p><p>Time ticks away, and the stare\nlingers on, but Harry feels the universe falter in its continuous lifetime.\nHaving her in the flesh reminds him of his hopeless attempts, and in one frail\nsecond, their paths intersect for one painfully perfect moment. It scares him\nthen of what she will do, and in this confined box with four other people, he\nwishes to be alone. One look at her eyes &ndash; once leaking in pain; one look at\nher cheeks &ndash; once staining in melancholy tears; one look at her and he\nremembers how it had felt to see her walk away.</p><p>Despite his fears, he does not\nanticipate a smile. An authentic smile reaching to her sparkling eyes that\ndisguise behind layers of beauty products to accentuate her marvelous attire.\nEven so, there is no difference in how his eyes perceive her. Whether she is in\na glamorous element or spilling her secrets through sobs, his entire heart\nbelongs to her. His heart that fluctuates with emotions momentarily settles on\njust one. Before he can return the kind gesture, before he can exhale with\ncontent and glee, her arms pull him in by the shoulders. She wraps herself softly\naround his frame, and her scent is the most divine, but he can only bask in it\nfor a second before associating it with the torture he knows all too well.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Hi, Harry,&rdquo; she says, and faintly\nnuzzles her chin in the crook of his neck. &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t heard from you in a while.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry stiffens. Over her shoulder,\nhe can see the doors closing for a final time. He can hear the other three in\ntheir own conversation. He can feel her warm breath sending twisters down his\nspine. It is over her shoulder that the color of the world shifts to gray. She\nhas not heard from him in a while, but he calls her at least once every week.\nTry as he might, he cannot forget her, and so he reaches out with hope that\nevery call will be the one she finally answers.</p><p>Her grip eases, though Harry&rsquo;s arms\nhave long fallen from her waist. She pulls away, and peers up at him with\ncaution in her eyes. Her smile paints a completely different picture. &ldquo;How&rsquo;ve\nyou been?&rdquo; she asks, purses her lips. Her casual behavior makes him sad, and if\nhe isn&rsquo;t mistaken, she looks to be begging him to stay quiet; she&rsquo;s begging him\nto not start something tonight that is unfinished from months ago.</p><p>&ldquo;Fine,&rdquo; he mumbles, but the answer\ncarries more significance than he lets on. She goes to stand by Sasha, but he\nrecalls his messages; he recalls how on her end, the decline button saves her.\nThe option to mute his conversation is a gift. Clearing her voicemail box is\nlifting a weight that she had never wanted on her shoulders. Her solution is to\npretend. She does as his first voicemail had asked her and pretends that the\nsecret night of confessions had never happened. She somehow pushes that memory\naway and pretends that everything is fine in their broken friendship.</p><p>She pretends that his love does not\nexist, and that is the greatest pain of all.&nbsp;</p><p>The ride up the remaining floors is\nuncomfortable for him, especially when he realizes that the trio are going to\nthe same party that he is. Where Jeff mingles in a short conversation with\nSophia and Sasha &ndash; who Harry now remembers seeing in one of y/n&rsquo;s Instagram\nposts &ndash; the younger man stands in his isolation by the keypad. He starts to\ndoubt that she is in love with him too. He wishes for her to spare him a\nglance; he wants to see the weakness in her frown. He cannot fathom how it is\npossible to stay away from the person that has one&rsquo;s heart, or even act as\nthough they barely exist. If he is to see that weakness, that pouty little\nexpression, <i>then</i> he will know if she\ntruly loves him too.</p><p>It feels like lifetimes before the\nelevator doors open to a floor that drowns in music. Sasha is the first of the\ntrio to step out, sashaying as he opens up Snapchat on his phone with a single\nhand. Harry reminisces a time when his younger self had grown fond of Twitter.\nWith a harsh push under the spotlight, he&rsquo;s since then snapped out of the\nsocial network daze and has learned a great deal of restraint. It is that\nrestraint that has kept him from checking up on y/n&rsquo;s profiles in those lonely\nfew months, but he wonders if he had taken the chance to peak, would he have\nknown about her appearance tonight?</p><p>&ldquo;Nice catching up, Jeff,&rdquo; Sophia\nsays. She links her arm with y/n&rsquo;s, helping her friend out the elevator since\nshe can&rsquo;t find it within herself to look up. As they pass by Harry, Sophia\nturns her head and sends him a nod and a smirk, which is far more attention\nthan y/n has given him in the past few months.</p><p>Harry smiles politely and allows\nthe two women to scurry away before trailing far behind them. He steps out onto\nthe floor, Jeff right on his tail, and the sea of beautiful faces begin to gawk\nat the legend before them. &ldquo;Did you know that y/n would be here?&rdquo; Harry asks, aware\nthat the madness will soon mask his voice.</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Jeff answers, but tilts his\nhead at the question. &ldquo;I figured between the two of us, you would have been the\none to know.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Like she said,&rdquo; Harry replies,\n&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been a while.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>After the so-called falling out,\nHarry had refused to talk about it with anyone. It isn&rsquo;t as if what had\nhappened embarrasses him, or that he falls in line with the other men who find\nit <i>un-masculine</i> to speak openly about\ntheir feelings. He doesn&rsquo;t associate expressing emotions to be masculine or\nfeminine; it is a human quality, a necessity and a treasure. The situation is\njust far too delicate for him. Y/n is a fragment belonging to a rare batch of\npeople that he trusts; the world is sometimes so cruel and unkind, and y/n is\nthe uniqueness that makes it worthwhile. Above anything, she is his friend, and\nhe will suffer through that title than to not have her at all. The only person\nthat he tells this to, is his mother.</p><p>&ldquo;I figured Sophia would be here,&rdquo;\nJeff says as they near the room that hosts the party. Harry gives him a\nquizzical look, silent for an explanation. &ldquo;She endorses a lot of companies on\nher Instagram. This is like a party and a business deal for her.&rdquo;</p><p>Of course. This new generation of\nnetworking supports a numerous amount of careers, ones that cannot exist\nwithout the thing he avoids the most. Sophia has an impressive following, so it\nmakes sense for her to be an attendee at this precious little soiree. With her\nand y/n practically attached at the hip, Harry understands how y/n manages to\nstick herself in a strange combination of people. She herself views her life as\nsimilar as the next average human being struggling for survival. She is a\nperson who shops in the sale section, dines at McDonald&rsquo;s, and pays her rent\nlate every now and then; the lavishing lifestyle is not her safe space.</p><p>Even so, she takes part in an\ninteresting act. Her compliance to a night full of hype and hysteria, flashing\ncameras and mindful eyes &ndash; it is not who she is, but she portrays the role very\nwell. She walks into the party, grinning at the other guests, though Harry has\na deep instinctive feeling that she now wants nothing more than to go back\nhome.</p><p>An hour passes and Harry has\nsuccessfully mingled with his friends, even going so far as to indulge in\nentertaining conversations with new faces. He doesn&rsquo;t know it until he is\ndowning his third glass, but the tequila has been rather inviting. He should\ndetest the burning taste; it is partially to blame for his impulsion on <i>that</i> night, and the voicemail that had\nled him to a slippery slope of solitude. So <i>damn\nthe tequila</i>, he says to himself, glaring at the innocent drink, but <i>damn,</i> the tequila resembles a craving\nthat he has been missing. It feels so strangely smooth running down his pretty\nthroat, and he feels it electrifying his veins.&nbsp;</p><p>Another hour passes. He giggles\nmore often than usual. People come up to him to take pictures &ndash; praising him\nand flaunting his name &ndash; and he sticks his wild tongue out in almost all of\nthem. He grows affectionate and clings to his friends, but <i>only</i> his friends. He cannot find the person that he really wants to\ncuddle. He&rsquo;s not even sure if she&rsquo;s still at the party, but frankly, he doesn&rsquo;t\ncare. This is his night, and he wants to spend it in a hazy cloud of illusions,\ndrowning in the purple lights and blaring music.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey!&rdquo; Jeff tugs at his shoulder.\nHarry sits on a stool in front of the bar, and his friend swivels his chair in\nhis direction. His sudden contact startles Harry, but he relaxes when he sees\nthe face of a man he heavily relies on. &ldquo;Are you ready to go?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Harry smiles. His lips fold tightly\ntogether, his flush face exposing his current state of mind. &ldquo;Not yet.&rdquo; He\nshakes his head. He swivels his chair back to the front, calls the bartender\nover so that he can order him and his bestest best friend &ndash; <i>don&rsquo;t tell Mitch </i>&ndash; a persuasive shot.</p><p>&ldquo;Not for me,&rdquo; Jeff declines, waving\nhis hand horizontally in a slicing motion across his throat. &ldquo;And honestly, you\nshould consider holding back too.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry can barely hear his voice\nover the music and overlapping conversations. Still, he makes out the general\ndetails, and something about his words have Harry gushing at his friend. He\ngrins up at him, dimples and all, and guides his heavy arms over Jeff&rsquo;s\nshoulders. &ldquo;Ah, you&rsquo;re so caring, you little&mdash;&rdquo; Harry finishes his sentence with\na growl, attacking his friend&rsquo;s closest cheek by taking a playful bite between\nhis pearly teeth. &ldquo;Very caring, you are. I&rsquo;m fine, I swear. I&rsquo;m having a good\ntime.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re sure?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes! It&rsquo;s a party, Jeffery! Go out\nand enjoy yourself.&rdquo;</p><p>Despite his encouragement, Jeff\ntakes a seat on the stool next to Harry and keeps him company. He stays for his\nfriend, who he knows is a bit of an impulsive drunk, and also someone that\nrelishes in camaraderie. It is also more challenging, Jeff says, for the pesky\nstrangers and tag-alongs to come up to Harry when he is already in a private conversation\nwith his manager. Therefore, the friends talk, and they laugh, and one has to\nkeep the other from losing all of his brain cells. It is a nice pattern that\nensues for half an hour until Jeff announces that he needs to use the restroom.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be right back,&rdquo; he says into\nHarry&rsquo;s ear, two hands pat his shoulders before he is off on his quest. While\nhe has fair intentions, Harry knows that he will not <i>be right back.</i> He will spend some time actually looking for the\ntoilets, squirm through tightly packed bodies both stationary and in rhythmic\nmotion. At an event like this, there is also surely to be a line. Then to\nsquirm his way back &ndash; it will be some time before he returns, which means that\nfor some time, Harry will be alone. Right now, Harry alone is a very dangerous\ncircumstance.</p><p>His first mistake is to order\nanother shot. A shot of what exactly, he&rsquo;s not too sure, but if it&rsquo;s the damned\ntequila then his mistake is much graver than he anticipates. His second mistake\nis to notice the hard, solid item in the back pocket of his trousers. It starts\nto bother him, especially with the seating position that he is in. He pulls the\ndevice out, and glares at how comfortably it fits in his right hand. His third\nmistake &ndash; oh, he certainty fears his third. A devious and curious thought\nflashes with warning, but before he can stop himself, he unlocks his phone and\npulls up the Instagram app. Notifications begin to pop up as they normally do,\nand sometimes it is difficult to wrap his head around the large numbers.</p><p>He doesn&rsquo;t go on now to gawk at the\nnumbers or scroll through his feed. He taps on the search bar, thumbs hesitant\nfor a second before typing away at the keyboard until her familiar handle\nappears. It has been months since he&rsquo;s seen her profile, even before his visit\nto her apartment. Her biography is simple and sweet, her profile photo is a\ntrue depiction of who she is. Her posts are a combination of snapshots, from\nmirror selfies to remarkable scenery to fun nights to memes, memes, and memes.\nAll of it is boldly her, but her most recent post captivates his attention.&nbsp;</p><p>He clicks on the slightly edited\npicture to enlarge the two women who pose together. Taken from the waist up,\nthe duo flashes similar seductive expressions at the camera. Sophia&rsquo;s body faces\nforward, her head tilts to accentuate her jawline, and a wine glass hangs from\nher fingertips. Y/n positions herself sideways, her back presses against\nSophia&rsquo;s arm, and her head aligns to her propped shoulder. Her features are\npudgier than Sophia&rsquo;s, her face not as defined, and her attire much less\nluxurious. To him, she glows amid the bustling bodies frozen in the background\nof their moment.</p><p>Her caption consists of a few\nplayful emoji&rsquo;s, another thing he isn&rsquo;t too fond of, but their innocence and liveliness\nin graphic and color makes him smile. If he remembers correctly, she doesn&rsquo;t\nmiss an opportunity to insert a clever caption, so he can imagine her\nfrustration at this party. He envisions her picking at her brain for the least\nbit of intellect left, cursing at people&rsquo;s buffoonery and celebration, but\nultimately deciding on the series of vague emoji&rsquo;s. She posts it an hour ago,\nominous without a location tag as the background does not give too much away.\nHe doesn&rsquo;t know if this means that she still breathes in the festivities or if\nit is her goodnight to the world before she hops on her flight back home.</p><p>&ldquo;Having a good time?&rdquo; a loud voice\nshouts into ear, grips his left shoulder, and lets their hand hang from the\nfirm crevice of his warm neck.</p><p>Harry nearly drops his phone\nface-down on the wet laminate surface of the bar. His heart races as he makes a\nquick and sly move to lock his phone, the screen turns black mid-jolt of surprise.\nHe swerves to his right side to meet with his intruder, and discovers a pair of\nrecognizable piercing eyes. They&rsquo;re cordial in their own sense, but the\nintimidation that laces somewhere beneath her irises is unmistakable. He\nresponds to her with a polite smile and nonchalant nod, which for her is enough\nof an invitation to pull up the empty stool next to him and stay. His attention\ndoesn&rsquo;t remain on her for too long, because after he acknowledges her presence,\nhe faces forward again with the desire to submerge himself in another drink.</p><p>&ldquo;It was a struggle to get to you,&rdquo;\nSophia remarks, one pant-clad leg crosses over the other. A manicured hand\nwhirls in the storm of her luscious locks, and her stilettos droop from the\nfirm shape of her feet with only a mere strap keeping them intact. &ldquo;I had a\ntussle with about three other people to get here.&rdquo;</p><p>At this, Harry laughs. His\nshoulders shake, his eyes squint, and his tiny tongue sticks out between his\nteeth. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you really ruffed them up.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh yeah.&rdquo; Sophia smiles. &ldquo;You sure\nare loved.&rdquo;</p><p>She means it endearingly &ndash; not in\nthe kiss-ass manner that many people do to him tonight, but with fair\nintentions of bringing comfort to an otherwise lonesome man. Either way, Harry\ndelivers a sad smile to the tabletop. His hands fidget with each other, and\nthen gravitates another one of his ordered drinks to him. He spins the glass\nwith his calloused fingers, watches the liquid slosh around in its crystalline\nconfinement.</p><p> &ldquo;Not by everyone,&rdquo; he says, clutches his\nglass, and raises it to his pink and swollen lips. He tilts his head back, downing\nthe contents as his eyes flutter shut. Sophia is in his peripheral vision, and\nshe watches him with a sincere, sympathetic look. Such a pity party he is, and\nit is usually at this low point that he decides to call it a night, rest his\nintoxicating thoughts, and suffer with vile regret in the late morning.</p><p>What stops\nhim tonight is Sophia&rsquo;s sweet and simple look that informs him of a simple\ntruth: she knows. No matter how much she succeeds in ignoring his texts, and\nhis calls, and his voicemails, y/n&rsquo;s tongue speaks his name after that final\ngoodnight. It contorts and curls and flattens with an elaboration of their card\ngame with a twist, and perhaps even licks away at the salty sensation of her\nrecollection. He&rsquo;s suspicious to the idea that perhaps this isn&rsquo;t as easy for\nher as he believes. She cannot push his memory beyond existence until it is\nnothing but a ghost filling her lungs with smoke; she suffers just as he does.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Does she\ntalk about me?&rdquo; Harry wonders aloud, sets his glass down with a harsh <i>clink!</i> He turns to Sophia, who already\nhas an impressively fierce look in her eyes, one eyebrow creating an arch to\ncompete against his inquiry.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Who does?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Right,\nlet&rsquo;s skip the part where you pretend that y/n hasn&rsquo;t told you.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Sophia\ndoesn&rsquo;t waver. She narrows her eyes, a test to Harry to see how long she can\ndrag out her charade. It is an intense stare-down on her end, but the charming\nman does not give into her antics. His face sags, not necessarily into a frown,\nbut rather a worn-out mien that has been through a fair share of\ndisappointment.<br /></p><p>He wins at\nher sigh of defeat, the pout in her lips replacing her once confident\nimpression. To say the least, his reward is not rewarding. &ldquo;Not really,&rdquo; Sophia\nhesitantly answers, &ldquo;but she wants to! I think. At least for your sake, I hope\nshe does.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Harry\nscoffs, but nods his head repetitively to sink down the information that cannot\nprocess with the empty glass he holds. He knows what she refers to when she\nsays for <i>his</i> sake: he is a complete\nmess without her, barely subdues his sorrows with his need for poison, fails to\nforget her. She cannot be more wrong. He doesn&rsquo;t need her. His life in the past\ncouple of months have flown with ease, with happiness and health. If anything,\nhis lack of communication with her distracts him less from the truest and most\nhonest love of his life: his music. Y/n does not meet the criteria that is\nnecessary for his complex existence. He does not need her.</p><p>&ldquo;So, she&rsquo;s\nblocking me out,&rdquo; Harry concludes, blinks away the dizziness and polychromatic\ndots that float across his vision like butterflies. He knows that she&rsquo;s been\nignoring him, that much is obvious &ndash; but to block him out? To hide him away in\na place of her confusing brain that she cannot possibly reach? That is nearly\nimpossible.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s\ngoing on with her life. I think maybe you should consider doing that too.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Harry sends\nher an incredulous look. &ldquo;Me? What do you think I&rsquo;ve been doing? Sitting around\nhere, waiting for her call?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Sophia\nreplies with a mocking expression. It is enough for him to recall the last\nvoicemail he had sent before boarding the plane to a new life without her.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Jesus,&rdquo;\nHarry grumbles. &ldquo;So much for not talking about me.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Harry,\nplease. I&rsquo;m not here to be hostile.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Enlighten\nme then, Soph. After all, you did tussle with three other people to get here.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a\nclass act, Styles.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Did she\nsend you or something? To tell me to piss off?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;No! If she\nwanted you to piss off, she would tell you herself.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Harry stays\nsilent, as silent as he can possibly be in this bizarre setting. He fixes his\nattention on Sophia, who has caution in her eyes, similar to a child caught\nwith their hand in the cookie jar. He searches her intensely, wonders if he\nhears her correctly, or if his surmise is far off from what she really means.\n&ldquo;Why doesn&rsquo;t she then?&rdquo; he asks, the words play over like a tragic symphony. He\npleas for an answer, almost whining with child-like eyes glassing over with\npure innocence.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t\nanswer that for her,&rdquo; Sophia says, &ldquo;but as her friend, I can tell you what I\nthink she deserves.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Is it me?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Sophia\npurses her lips, spreads the smooth lipstick over her plump lips. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not\nthis,&rdquo; she answers, a hint in her determined voice feeling bad for him. &ldquo;Whatever\n<i>this</i> actually is. A back-and-forth.\nYou call her, she ignores you. It&rsquo;s taking a toll on her having to deal with\nthis every week, same as it did that night. I&rsquo;m not saying that y/n is innocent\nin this, because clearly, she&rsquo;s not, but she has her reasons. You need to respect\nthem.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Harry wants\nto cry. He wants to release everything that y/n stores in him: the rage, the\nmourning, the self-pity, the love. The endless, endless love that he doesn&rsquo;t\never imagine he can have for someone in this whirlwind of a lifetime. It&rsquo;s become\ntoo much, but he still doesn&rsquo;t understand how it has come to this. What are her\nreasons? What compels her to stay away from something that can be so bloody\nbrilliant?<br /></p><p>&ldquo;She\ndoesn&rsquo;t need to love someone that worries her all the time,&rdquo; Sophia continues.\nThe heedful filter inside of her runs out, her words confirming to him the\ntruths he&rsquo;s always known. If she is to do anything for her friend, it is this.\n&ldquo;She needs someone who&rsquo;s there, Harry. I know you want to be, but have you ever\nstopped to consider her side of things?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he\nanswers instantly, breathing out through his mouth. He blinks sluggishly, a\nstrange effect taking over. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s &hellip; she can be&hellip;&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Sophia\nwaits for an answer that doesn&rsquo;t appear. &ldquo;She can be a what?&rdquo;<br /></p><p><i>Loved.</i> She can be loved by anyone, and\nanyone who is lucky enough to make her heart happy should be enough for him.\nBut it isn&rsquo;t. It isn&rsquo;t, because he is selfish, and he loves her too much to let\nthis be the end of it. She can be loved by anyone, but she will find something\neternal that is worth the heartache if she is to be loved by him.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;She can be\nwith me,&rdquo; Harry slurs, a hiccup raking through his body. He looks pathetic, he\nknows he does, but none of it matters. Whatever happens tomorrow doesn&rsquo;t matter\nif tonight means nothing.<br /></p><p>Sophia\nshakes her head. She uncrosses a leg and stretches it out onto the sweaty\ndancefloor. She adjusts her outfit, rakes a hand through her hair, and points a\nlazy finger at Harry. &ldquo;That is not for you to decide,&rdquo; she tells him, and\nshakes her head again as a proper farewell. Her legs only carry her so far\nbefore Harry&rsquo;s calling back at her.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; he\nshouts, audible to her, but deaf to the drunks surrounding them. Sophia whirls\naround, stands tall in her place as bodies mistakenly push into her. &ldquo;This\nisn&rsquo;t for <i>you</i> to decide! I&rsquo;m sorry,\nSophia, but this concerns me and this concerns y/n. <i>No </i>one else.&rdquo; Harry stands to his feet, the glass in his hands serving\nno purpose but to fuel his veins prior to his assertive nature taking over. He\nrotates his head in every direction, moving mindlessly through the storming\ncrowd as Sophia begins to hold him back.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;What are\nyou&mdash;&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Where is\nshe?&rdquo; he demands, swivels his way around her as he would with a pesky tree in\nhis path. &ldquo;We need to talk.&rdquo;<br /></p><p><i>&ldquo;No!&rdquo;</i> Sophia reprimands, using all of\nher might to pull him back by the eager arm. She leans back on her stilettos,\nbut he practically drags her across the floor. To any onlooker, the interaction\nappears as harmless as two friends having a playful laugh. &ldquo;No, you are not!\nDon&rsquo;t even think about it, fucker!&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Foul\nmouth, Sophia.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t\na game! You can&rsquo;t just press pause and resume as if it doesn&rsquo;t affect anyone\nelse! Think about <i>her</i> for once!&rdquo;</p><p>Harry comes\nto a halt. Sophia&rsquo;s body rams into his back, she huffs but refuses to let go of\nher hold on his arm. She doesn&rsquo;t strike a chord in him with her words, nor does\nshe persuade him to back off. In reality, the world around him comes to a stop.\nNo one else matters, whether they are gawking at him or serving him no\nattention. She stands there, in the midst of all the chaos, and her universe\ncollides with his for a single, mere moment. She gapes at him, and her limbs\nfreeze, and whatever Sasha is yelling into one ear goes out the other. He is\ndeaf to the music, blind to the lights, and he cannot feel anything but the\nbeat of his aching heart.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I think\nabout her all the time,&rdquo; he says in a hushed tone, a mantra that he recites,\nassuring him of his affection. No one else hears his special words, but maybe\ny/n focuses on him long enough to read his quivering lips. He does not know; she\nis a statue in her own world, a piece of art that he admires and displays to\nthe mass for all of her beauties, but at the end of the day, she is his. She is\na separate entity of pure magic, but she belongs to him, and he gives up\neverything to have her.<br /></p><p>Harry\ncontinues his walk, which worries Sophia as she starts tugging him back again.\nThe closer he gets to y/n, the more his stomach squirms and twists and flips.\nHe does, however, find ease in slipping through the crowd; it feels as if they\npart for him, relishing in the cinematic moment that is to take place with a\nfew more meager steps. When he does eventually reach her, he finds himself\nfrowning, because she cannot bear to look him in the eyes. She searches the\nrumbling floor, closing in on herself as if to disappear.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I miss\nyou,&rdquo; Harry says, and he somehow finds the strength to overpower the music that\nis disparate to this specific point in time. &ldquo;Look at me,&rdquo; he demands of her,\nbut dares not to touch her fragile cocoon. &ldquo;Y/n, please.&rdquo; His voice wavers,\nweak and damaged, reaching out to her even if she does not want him to.<br /></p><p>Sasha darts\nhis eyes between the two friends, or lovers &ndash; he&rsquo;s not quite sure. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s\ngoing on?&rdquo; he asks, oblivious to y/n&rsquo;s lack of comfort, and the manner in which\nher systems fail to save her. She feels the familiar burn in her nose,\nremembers the last time Harry had begun a sentence with <i>I</i> and had ended it with <i>you.</i>\nIt hits her in a single slap of a moment, time quite irrelevant as the tears\nstart to break apart from her soft eyes.<br /></p><p>She can&rsquo;t be here, so she does the\nlittle something that he haunts himself with every day, and the image of her\nwalking away for a second time has his knees growing weak, almost failing to\nsupport the gravity of her response. Yet, he keeps his ground. He watches the\nlittle shake of her head, though he doesn&rsquo;t know how she can disagree with his\ncertainty, and watches her legs carry her to the hallway outside of the party.\nIt is only this time that he refuses to let her go; he refuses to stand by and\nfeel sorry for himself, left to wonder where it had all gone wrong.</p><p>He follows\nher out; the yellow lights of the hallway and the sudden expanse of vacancy\ncauses a disturbance to his movements. He feels as if he is floating in\nmid-air, swimming to her, who is an albatross flying miles and miles above him.\n&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; he calls out, and the few who meander outside of the party turn their\nheads to find the source of outburst.<br /></p><p>She doesn&rsquo;t\nstop, but he can see the flinch in her body at his command. Her legs carry her\nas fast as they are able to in the elevated footwear she sports, jewelry\njingling against each other, footsteps scrapping against the carpet floors. He\nhas no choice but to accelerate onward, using his advantage of comfortable\nshoes to match her speed until he surpasses her in the chase, turns on his\nheels, and blocks her open-ended path.<br /></p><p>His words\nspeed out from his tongue, &ldquo;stop, stop, stop!&rdquo; His hands are on her shoulders\nnow, covered in the softest cloth he&rsquo;s ever known. &ldquo;If you could please just\nstop and listen and talk to me&mdash;&rdquo;<br /></p><p><i>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;</i> she croaks out, still rebuffing\nany eye-contact. Her arms poke out, pushing him away, but he is firm in his\nplace. With a final attempt, she musters up her remnants of energy and gives\nhim a solid shove, a forceful one that pushes her back from him until a space\nopens up between them.</p><p>Harry gapes\nat her. His eyebrows knit in shock, his mouth ajar as the words are suddenly\nlost. She stands in front of him with dejection pouring down and outlining the\nshape of her shrunken face. There is still no eye contact between them, but y/n\nfinally does not walk away. Her breaths are ragged, the walls feel as though\nthey&rsquo;re closing in. She nibbles on the inside of her cheek, and nervously\nwiggles her fingers down by her side.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Why are\nyou doin&rsquo; this?&rdquo; he asks, hands prop on his hips. He has to know. If all else\ngoes wrong, if it really is the end, then he has to know why.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t\nwant to do this right now.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Alright,\nthen when? Because you certainly didn&rsquo;t want to talk about it two months ago,\nor any time I tried to reach you thereafter. Not even a descent message to let\nme know if you were even okay.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Maybe\nbecause it wasn&rsquo;t any of your business!&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;The hell it\nisn&rsquo;t! Tell me how you could be so stubborn to think that? Tell me how it\ndoesn&rsquo;t concern me at all&mdash;&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Because\nthere is no <i>it</i>, Harry!&rdquo; y/n seethes,\nand lets out a teary scoff. &ldquo;There is no <i>it</i>\nthat we have to talk about. It&rsquo;s not &ndash; it doesn&rsquo;t&hellip;&rdquo; She doesn&rsquo;t notice it,\nbut she&rsquo;s practically in his face now. Looking into his eyes, the glimmer that\nshe admires is gone. She exhales a sigh, and lets her frustration simmer down\nbefore finishing her thought. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not there. It never had been.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not\ntrue,&rdquo; Harry disagrees, quick with the shake of his head. &ldquo;Please, y/n, after\nall of this, you should know that&rsquo;s not true.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not in\nlove&mdash;&rdquo;<br /></p><p><i>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t.</i>&rdquo; Harry leans in closer and\nwhispers. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t try to push me away. You know there&rsquo;s something there because\neven if you feel nothing for me, even if it&rsquo;s only me and I&rsquo;m an idiot to be in\nlove with someone that doesn&rsquo;t love me back, it&rsquo;s still true. I&rsquo;m in love with\nyou, and that&rsquo;s still something.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>With his\nhead tilting down to confess in her ear, y/n&rsquo;s eyes focus on the rolls of his\nneck to which a silver chain kisses and a blanket of warm skin hugs. It is so\neasy to fall into his words. So easy to bury herself in his embrace, to feel\nthe electric pull of his entire being. So, so easy.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;So, tell\nme again,&rdquo; he says, a soothing turn to the treacherous ambience that bubbles\nthem in, away from the world outside. &ldquo;Tell me that you&rsquo;re not in love with me,\nbut don&rsquo;t try to tell me how I feel about you. Because it&rsquo;s always been you,\ny/n.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Y/n&rsquo;s lips\nwrinkle, a prominent pout that portrays the weakness he had once wanted to see.\nNow that his eyes sparkle over them so clearly, he wants nothing more than to\nwash her fragility away. &ldquo;Not always,&rdquo; she mumbles, her mouth moving to the\nside of her face. In consequence of that forms a smile, but there is nothing\nhumorous in the gesture. It&rsquo;s sad, frightfully so, as if she sees herself as\nnothing but a joke. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s always been someone else. You know that. Even if in\nthe back of your mind you were thinking of me, you were with someone else. You\nmight think that everything you&rsquo;re saying is true, but I was never entirely\nyours. I knew that from the start.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;No,\nthat&rsquo;s&hellip;&rdquo; Harry shakes his head. He makes a bold decision to reach a single\nhand up &ndash; the left one, with his inked cross swaying back and forth to the\ncalming rhythm that she admires &ndash; and cups the side of her face in a graceful\nmanner. His touch hovers over her wet skin, and it hurts to know that it is his\ndoing. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s entirely different, y/n.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Maybe for\nyou.&rdquo; She shrugs. &ldquo;But not to me. Not in my eyes.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>What can he\nsay? It isn&rsquo;t as if he can convince her that her perspective is otherwise &ndash; he\nhas to validate these feelings. He has to understand her reasoning, or else he\nis right back where he had started.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Alright.&rdquo;\nHe nods, caressing a single thumb over her cheek. He savors the moment; the\nscent that he inhales is intoxicatingly addictive. He doesn&rsquo;t know when it will\nend, or when will be the last time he can breathe her in like this, so close\ntogether. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t change that. I can&rsquo;t change how you viewed everything, and\nit&rsquo;s my fault that you even had to see it that way at all. I&rsquo;m to blame, and I\nknow that.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Y/n shakes\nher head. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not about pointing fingers, Harry.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I know. I\nknow it&rsquo;s not, but it&rsquo;s a start.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A start to\nwhat?&rdquo; y/n asks exasperatedly. She searches for something in him, but he&rsquo;s not\nsure of what exactly. An answer? A defeat? A silence that cannot possibly solve\nany of her inquiries and fears?<br /></p><p>&ldquo;A start to\nwhatever the hell this is,&rdquo; Harry answers without a stutter in his voice. &ldquo;Me\nfiguring out how to prove to you that it <i>has</i>\nalways been you, and how I fear that it always <i>will </i>be you. That&rsquo;s not healthy, y/n, in a world of billions and\nonly being moved by one. If I have to spend the rest of my life proving myself\nto you, I won&rsquo;t hesitate to do it. Even if you don&rsquo;t want me, which I&rsquo;m sorry\nto say, but I&rsquo;m pretty sure we&rsquo;ve already found out is not the case.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Y/n softly chuckles, and it is\nthen he notices that her tears no longer flow. It is progress, and it has been\na struggle to get here. &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t be able to,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;I know my worth, but\nthat doesn&rsquo;t mean I don&rsquo;t tear myself apart sometimes. <i>You</i> don&rsquo;t make that any easier and the worst part is that it&rsquo;s not\neven your fault. You can&rsquo;t stop the rest of the world from loving you, so <i>I&rsquo;m</i> sorry to say that you won&rsquo;t be able\nto convince me of anything otherwise.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I beg to\ndiffer.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t\ncare.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t\nI just try?&rdquo; he asks, and this time his other hand follows. He has her entire\nface in his hold, and she looks so precious standing here, her faces squishes,\nher pouty but kissable lips. &ldquo;You say that I don&rsquo;t make it easier, but you\nhaven&rsquo;t even tried to see if maybe it&rsquo;s not as hard as you think.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Because I\nknow myself better than anyone, Harry. Sometimes, I even know you better than\nyou know yourself. I envision your future and how everything will turn out, and\nI worry over things that don&rsquo;t even concern me. I live your life in ways that\nyou haven&rsquo;t even dreamed about and I understand your little catchphrases and\nyour antics. I do it all for you, because someone has to, and I don&rsquo;t know why\nit has to be, but it is. I do that for you, so pardon me if I already have an\nidea of how hellish this could turn out.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>When y/n\nlooks up at Harry, she sees a wavering light that flickers with stardust. His\nuniverse has never looked lovelier, but it also has a strangeness to it that\nshe is not familiar with. Her little rant ends on a negative note, so she\ndoesn&rsquo;t know why he stares at her as though she is the first existence he has\never known.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;God, I&rsquo;m\nso in love with you,&rdquo; He declares, and he doesn&rsquo;t give her any time to process\nbefore he has his mouth over hers. It is inviting, to feel the shape that fits\nso well with his. <i>This</i> is the crave\nthat he has been missing, this sudden wild flare of emotions, and though it is\nnot perfect, it is more than enough for him.<br /></p><p>Y/n mumbles\nagainst his lips, though he doesn&rsquo;t miss the fact that she pulls him in as much\nhe does to her. Her hand has found his waist, but her pesky lips keep mumbling,\nbreaking apart the contact that he wishes to endure for the rest of his life.\n&ldquo;No, this is a bad idea,&rdquo; she speaks into his lips, the same hand on his waist\nnow faintly pushing him away.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s\nnot,&rdquo; he kisses back.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Mm-mmm.&rdquo;\ny/n shakes her head. Their lips pull away, and when they do, she notices the\ntransfer of her lipstick onto his mouth. &ldquo;This is,&rdquo; she pauses, and lets out a\nlaughing huff, &ldquo;this is not going to work out at all.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Why do you\nkeep saying that?&rdquo; he asks, his hands travel down to her shoulders. He rubs\nagainst them, then slithers his way down to her upper back. It is much harder\nfor her to escape him now. &ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t you allow yourself this? You daydream\nabout the future but none of it matters because try as you might, you&rsquo;ll never\nreally know how amazing this can be.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t\nbe so amazing.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Why bloody\nnot?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Because\nyou said so yourself!&rdquo; she exclaims, and he opens his mouth to retaliate, but\nshe beats him to the mark. &ldquo;You might not have said it exactly, but you definitely\nsaid it. You said that this is your life and you can&rsquo;t slow down and that it&rsquo;s\ndifferent for you! As far as I&rsquo;m concerned, that doesn&rsquo;t sound so amazing. You&rsquo;re\nin the clouds now, Harry, and you&rsquo;re going to reach galaxies you&rsquo;ve never even\nimagined. From down on the ground, it looks like you&rsquo;re never going to stop,\nand you won&rsquo;t. You can&rsquo;t. Not even for the person that you&rsquo;re in love with.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Her words\nare fairly blunt, but Harry recalls their conversation. His single confession\nto her only play of a wild card, a distant memory that can properly place\nitself into another dimension. That night, they had not been happy. They had\nbeen foolish, going about the situation in all the wrong ways, because the\nsilence has never been their friend. Between them, there is never an absence,\nnever a stillness in the air. It has always been just them, the way they\ninteract with each other, whether it is a surplus of verbal words or\nconversations through their looks and gestures. They had been missing that\ntreasure on that cursed night, and neither of them were attentive enough to\nrealize it.<br /></p><p>Harry\nsmiles at her. His dimple is prominent, and she has to keep herself from\nswooning at the close sight of it. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he says, joy laces in his\ntone. She tilts her head in a quizzical manner: <i>know what?</i> she asks with her stare, the silence never prevailing. &ldquo;You\ndon&rsquo;t know how everything looks like through my eyes. When I see you, and the\nworld gets hazy, and I can&rsquo;t hear or feel anything. My heart turns into\nsomething else, something I can&rsquo;t explain. I don&rsquo;t understand how when I&rsquo;m with\nyou, time just &hellip; stops. Everything stops for you.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Harry pulls\nher in slowly, their foreheads brushing as their noses crinkle against each\nother. &ldquo;I promise,&rdquo; he whispers, nudging at her so that she can welcome her\nsweet lips to his. &ldquo;Everything stops for you,&rdquo; he repeats, and connects their\nlips for a third time, and each one holds something different, something unexplainably\nspecial. He wants to say more, to further prove himself, and prove how well\ntheir love can be. He can&rsquo;t though, because her lips press against his, her\nhands wrap around him, and she lets herself fall in love with everything he is\nand everything he has to give.<br /></p><p>After a\nshort lip-locking moment &ndash; where not much privacy ensues, and he tries not to\nmind whatever pictures surface the next morning &ndash; their movements become a\nlittle sloppier, and Harry has the devilish urge to bite on her swollen lip. He\npulls at it between his cheeky grin, which gets a grimacing smile out of her as\nthey separate. He can&rsquo;t control the flutter of laughter that escapes him,\nattacking her with a chaste kiss on her cheek before whispering in her ear. &ldquo;Hey,\nif you&rsquo;re up for it, we can try out that kink of yours now.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Ugh.&rdquo; Y/n\nrolls her eyes, then reaches up to twist his nipple through his button-up. &ldquo;Such\na gentleman you are.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Ow!&rdquo; he\nyelps, giggling as he palms at the sensitive area. &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t tell me that was\npart of it, cheeky lovie!&rdquo;</p>",

He does not register the silence until it\nsubmerges the entire apartment. His ears strain to catch even the faintest\nsound on the other side of the door. The painted walls muffle her movements;\nnot a single light shines from the crack at his feet.</p>\n<p>The poor\nman is a blossoming flower; petals of sweetness expand from the force of\nnature&rsquo;s love. He is powerful, but the dirt pulls him to the ground with its\nmuddy hands, and steadies him for the hurricane that is to strike. He cannot\nmove. He stands and relives the events that baffle his brain: she walks away;\nshe dismisses him with a fragile goodnight, a farewell that he fears will be\nthe last; he confesses his secrets and she scrambles with strange abandonment.\nOver a dozen times does he relive those taunting moments, seconds ticking\nfurther and further away.</p>\n<p>This\ndoesn&rsquo;t make the least bit of sense to him. He can imagine it from his\nperspective without strife. He professes his love, and it unveils a grand twist\nto their years-long story. He can taste the sorrow on her lips, a mixture of\nsalt and relief. He can feel the dip in her neck where his eager hands find a\nhome, fingertips pressing with a passion. He can imagine her sweet lips to\nconfess the eight letters that welcome heaven to his heart. When he opens his\neyes, he stares at an empty wall instead. Her presence lingers, but she is not\nhere.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Harry\ndoesn&rsquo;t make a sound. He doesn&rsquo;t know if she sleeps tenderly under the comfort\nof her sheets &ndash; if exhaustion makes it that much easier for her to rest. He\ndoes not pick apart his brain to imagine, because to imagine her all snug in\nhis shaded arms is too much to bear. Consequently, with the last ounce of\nenergy that he has left, he shakes the desire from his clouded mind, and walks\naway.</p>\n<p><b><i>&gt;Can you please call me back?</i></b><b><i>&nbsp;</i></b></p>\n<p><b><i>&gt;I&rsquo;m sorry if I was pressuring you. It wasn&rsquo;t my intention.</i></b><b><i>&nbsp;</i></b></p>\n<p><b><i>&gt;I leave on the sixth. Can we please talk before then?</i></b></p>\n<p>Messages\nslither their way into Harry&rsquo;s everyday routine. Unanswered calls are a given, and\nhis desperate voicemails are almost therapeutic. His time ticks away, and it\nfills with him an anxiety that no crowd can ever compare with. In the days that\nfollow, he succumbs to self-hatred. He will never forgive himself for ruining\nsomething so special. A fresh sheet once written with loving memories is\nnothing but a smudge of ink, a ball that he crumples with his own bare hands.\nThe wrinkles and creases can never return to their former smooth state,\neternally marking his selfish behavior in the folded lines.</p>\n<p>Four days\ncome and go. He goes longer periods of time without communicating with y/n, but\nthis particular situation has his head spinning off and into the clouds. She\nhas yet to call him back, and he will have to leave soon. His career requires\nhis attention elsewhere, in places that y/n cannot go. Somewhere in his mind,\nhe wonders if that is her plan. Does she count the days, waiting for him to\ndisappear so that <i>finally</i> she can\ntoo?<br /></p>\n<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;\nHarry asks her. His legs dangle, knees bent at the edge of the hotel bed. His\nbody spreads across the center. One hand covers his face, index finger and\nthumb rubbing harshly against his eyes. The other clutches his phone, and\npresses it against his flaming ear. &ldquo;Why aren&rsquo;t you picking up your phone? You\ncouldn&rsquo;t have thrown it out the window again. Why can&rsquo;t you just call me back\nor send me a message to fuck off? Why do you insist on being so&mdash;&rdquo;<br /></p>\n</p>",
