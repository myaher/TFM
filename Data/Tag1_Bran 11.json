It was understandable at first, he had to take care of his duties, rebuild King&rsquo;s Landing for example, but now everything was going fine and you felt like he was evading you.</p><p>Looking for him you encountered Brienne who told you Bran was in the garden nex to the meeting room, but he had asked to be left alone.</p><p>You went anyway and he was standing in the middle of it, he wasn&rsquo;t even warging; but he was with his head tilted back and eyes closed.</p><p>Taking a few steps, you put your hands carefully on his shoulders and then dragged them to his chest, his eyes opened and looked to you, faces barely a few centimeters away and lips grazing. </p><p>&ldquo;You left early again&rdquo; you said still not moving, since your hands were on his chest you could feel him hold his breath for a moment. </p><p>&ldquo;Tyrion needed me for something&rdquo; he said smiling as he took your hands and took them off of his chest, trying to get as far as he could from your touch. </p><p>You stared at him, knowing you were about to cry, because you felt like he was avoiding you, he&rsquo;s been doing it for so long now and at first you understood, he had things to take care of but right now he won&rsquo;t even kiss you.</p><p>Bran looked alarmed at you as he saw how the tears started to accumulate in your eyes. You <i>hated </i>to cry in front of anyone, you never were one to show vulnerability but the while situation was overwhelming you. You loved him and it was horrible to feel like he despised you.</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N&hellip; why are you crying? No, come here&rdquo; he said trying to reach your hand but you took a step away.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been trying to understand you&rdquo; you said, and the tears finally started falling, &ldquo;to give you the space you needed; I&rsquo;ve never tried to rush things because I know how things are for you. But now you won&rsquo;t even kiss me&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N, I-&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s fine if you don&rsquo;t want me but at least don&rsquo;t act like I disgust you&rdquo; it was all you said before you left. Bran looking at you leave hating himself so damn much. It wasn&rsquo;t your fault, it could never be your fault. It was all him and now he had made you feel like utter shit.</p><p>You spent the day walking around King&rsquo;s Landing until the sun started to go down, you didn&rsquo;t want to see Bran. It was the last thing you wanted so you tried to sneak into the castle to your room.</p><p>When you got there, you closed the door carefully so no one could notice you were back, turning around you almost let out a scream. Bran was sitting on your shared bed staring back at you. </p><p>You opened the door to leave.</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N, no please, stay. I want to talk to you&rdquo; he said softly. </p><p>&ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; you leaned against the door. </p><p>&ldquo;Please, come here&rdquo; he tapped the place beside him and you battled yourself. Finally walking towards the bed and sitting next to him. </p><p>&ldquo;Listen, none of this is your fault. You could never disgust me. Never. You&rsquo;re the most beautiful woman I&rsquo;ve ever seen and I love you, it&rsquo;s just&hellip;&rdquo; you looked at him intently as he seemed to be conflicted about all this. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never been with someone. Intimately. And I&rsquo;m this&rdquo; he looked down at his legs, &ldquo;and you&rsquo;re this beautiful girl with more experience than me; I- I don&rsquo;t know what to do when you&rsquo;re around me and surely I don&rsquo;t want to be a disappointment to you. I&rsquo;m so sorry&rdquo;</p><p>You took a moment to process things and then jumped to him. Hugging him tightly. </p><p>&ldquo;You could never be a disappointment to me Bran&rdquo; you said to him. Your lips almost touching, &ldquo;would you let me teach you?&rdquo; </p><p>His cheeks turned crimson and you tought he was the most beautiful boy ever. So handsome and innocent. And he was all yours just as you were his. </p><p>He nodded and you kissed him slowly. </p><p>You straddled him and he moaned at the feeling of your clothed parts touching. Taking his hands you placed them on your breasts and looked down at him, admiration and lust filled his gaze. </p><p>Leaning down, you kissed him slowly as you grinded on him, Bran groaning at the feeling. You bit his lips as your hands started to take of his clothes, leaving his chest exposed. </p><p>You left a trail of kisses all the way from his neck to his chest. Bran looking at you intently, his cheeks rosy and bitting his lower lip. He was something else.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make you feel so good.&rdquo;</p></p>",
