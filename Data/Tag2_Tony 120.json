They had been separated for\nso long before they got to be together openly and publicly. They had been\nreunited for the last 4 years. Their relationship plateaued about 6 months ago.\nSteve had started to distancing himself and spending more time in Tony\u2019s lab\nand Bucky grew closer to Nat. </p><p>\u201cBuck, I need to talk with you,\u201d Steve spoke softly. </p><p>Bucky swallowed hard and nodded. He followed Steve to the\ncouch in their living room and sat down sprawled out. \u201cWhat do you want to talk\nabout Stevie?\u201d</p><p>Steve sat down staring at Bucky, \u201cYou know I love you. I\nfeel like something is missing from our relationship. I am wanting us to have\nan open relationship.\u201d Steve ducked his head avoiding Bucky\u2019s eyes. </p><p>\u201cYou mean like we used to back in the 30\u2019s and 40\u2019s. When I\nused to bring girls home and then after you rescued me from Azzano you and\nPeggy,\u201d Bucky responded like it was normal to talk about. Steve nodded afraid Bucky\nwas going to get mad. \u201cPoor baby, I am not going to get mad sweetheart. I am\ngood with us being in an open relationship. We both get to be with each other\nand other people as well. Did you have anyone in mind is that why you are\nasking?\u201d</p><!-- more --><p>\u201cYeah Buck,\u201d Steve was blushing. \u201cI have someone in mind. I didn\u2019t\nrealize I wanted to be with them romantically or sexually until as of late.\nThey would be good with it. We used to kind of be together like how we were\nbefore I found you again. I miss him just like I missed you.\u201d </p><p>With Steve\u2019s rambling Bucky knew who he was talking about.\nHe grabbed Steve and pulled him into cuddle, \u201cIt\u2019s okay baby. I know you and\nTony had a thing before I came back. I should have realized that wasn\u2019t going\nto go away when I came back. I know you tried but you have some much love to\ngive Stevie. You want to be with me and Tony baby doll?\u201d</p><p>Steve nodded as Bucky kissed his head. \u201cI just want you to\nbe happy to Buck. I don\u2019t want you to see me with someone else and get jealous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaby, I have someone else too. You know me and Nat go way\nback. I don\u2019t think you know that before I was just the asset. I still was\nBucky. They didn\u2019t brainwash me a ton to where I didn\u2019t know who I was. I still\nhad some semblance of myself. The only thing was I didn\u2019t remember you at all.\nI was training the girls in the Red Room Academy. Nat was one of those girls.\nShe was 18 when we started to fall for each other,\u201d Bucky tucked his face into\nSteve\u2019s hair as he continued to tell the story. \u201cWe kept it a secret as long as\nwe could from Hydra. We both knew if they caught us, I would be sent to Siberia\nand completely wiped. We were careful for 2 years. Then We slipped up. They\ncaught us and shipped me off to Siberia where I was wiped to where I didn\u2019t remember\nanyone. Then they used me as a weapon. Kept me on ice until they needed me.\nThey would thaw me out and use me. They used me to train others like me. They\nused me to kill. I forgot all about you and Nat. That was until you saved me\nStevie.\u201d Bucky kissed his head and squeezed him tight. \u201cNat and I have been\ntalking about rekindling the relationship to see if it would be able to work. I\njust needed to make sure my baby doll was on board.\u201d</p><p>Steve snuggled into Bucky tighter, \u201cIf it makes you happy\nBuck. Then I am all for it. I think it would be good for you and Nat. You both\nhave some stories and history that no one can understand but you too. I Can\nhave my engineer and you can have your lethal assassin.\u201d Steve smirked as he\nturned his head to kiss Bucky. As soon as their lips met Bucky deepened the\nkiss. </p><p>Bucky whispered against Steve\u2019s soft pliable lips, \u201cYou know\nat some point we can probably have a foursome. It would be fun to see you fuck\nNat and me take Tony apart bit by bit. I sometimes fantasize about baby. You\nthink you little engineer would be down sometime? I know Nat would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am sure I can motivate Tony. I would be pretty hot to see\nyou take Tony apart and then put him back together. He needs maintenance to\nkeep him in check. It helps with his PTSD,\u201d Steve smirked against Bucky\u2019s\nmouth. Steve bit gently at Bucky\u2019s lower lip. \u201cWe need to let them know we can\nbe with them too. I was thinking of breaking the news to Tony by making in dinner\nand being a romantic I could have never been with Howard back then.\u201d</p><p>Bucky laughed, \u201cI forgot you and Howard were a thing there\nfor a while. Everyone though sweet Steve Rogers (Captain America) was a virgin.\nNo one knew how much of a slut you really were especially after the serum. You\ngained all that muscle and body. I wanted to jump you every chance I got. Didn\u2019t\nwe have a threesome with Peggy, you and me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah Buck, we did. Peggy was the Dom in that scene. She\ntreated her pets really well. Howard walked in on us and we dragged him into\nplaying. It turned into a foursome. I remember Howard bending you over the\nvanity in the room making you watch yourself as he fucked your ass hard and\ngood,\u201d Steve remembered quite fondly. </p><p>\u201cWe all really fondued huh,\u201d Bucky joked. Steve shook his\nhead. </p><p>\u201cAll 3 of you never let me live that down,\u201d Steve responded\nblushing. \u201cI may not have been a virgin but I was uncultured. I had never\ntraveled outside of Brooklyn before the war. My first time in Europe and I\nsaved your ass. We didn\u2019t have money so I had no idea that fondue was cheese,\nbread and fruit. I never had French food before.\u201d </p><p>Bucky wrapped around Steve more even though Steve was a\nlittle upset about the fondue joke again. They stayed like that for a while. </p><p>The next day Steve got some flowers and candy to woo Tony.\nSteve was nervous since he didn\u2019t know if Tony would be okay with sharing him. Tony\nand Pepper have been on the outs for the last few years. Tony works way too\nmuch. Steve grabs the roses he bought for Tony and headed down to Tony\u2019s lab. </p><p>\u201cHey capsicle,\u201d Tony cheerily says. </p><p>\u201cHey Tony. I have some things for you. I wanted to talk to\nyou,\u201d Steve shily mentions. </p><p>\u201cWhat do you want to talk about Steven,\u201d Tony looks at him\nquestioningly. </p><p>\u201cThese are for you,\u201d Steve hands over the flowers and chocolates\nhe had hand picked for Tony. </p><p>\u201cThank you Capsicle,\u201d Tony smiled. Tony smelled the roses\nand looked at the chocolates. \u201cYou know what chocolates I enjoy Steve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome precious,\u201d Steve let slip. </p><p>\u201cPrecious huh,\u201d Tony questioned. </p><p>Steve blushed from the roots of his hair to his toes, \u201cThat\nis what I wanted to talk with you about. Come sit down with me on the couch\nthat you have in here.\u201d Tony sat down with Steve on the couch. \u201cHow would you\nlike to go on a date Tony?\u201d</p><p>Tony looked at Steve confused, \u201cAre you and Buckaroo good?\u201d</p><p>Steve smiled and nodded, \u201cYeah Tony, Bucky and I are good. We\ndecided to open up our relationship and date others outside of me and Bucky.\nBucky is going to start dating Nat and I wanted to date you. I missed being with\nyou my precious boy.\u201d</p><p>Tony straddled Steve\u2019s lap on the couch, \u201cI missed you too Steve.\nI hate that we ended things because I couldn\u2019t be in the same room as Bucky and\nthat drove you and him closer together. If I hadn\u2019t hated him so much, we\nprobably would have still been together.\u201d Tony leaned in and nipped at Steve\u2019s jaw.\nSteve whimpered pushing his head to the side and allowing Tony access to his\nneck. Tony bit and sucked on Steve\u2019s neck leaving marks he knew that were going\nto fade by tomorrow. </p><p>\u201cFuck, I missed you Tony,\u201d Steve placed his hands-on Tony\u2019s\nass as he thrusted his hips up into Tony\u2019s.</p><p>Tony moaned into Steve\u2019s neck, \u201cFuck I missed you too Capsicle.\nYou feel so good.\u201d Tony ran his hands down Steve\u2019s chest and palmed him when he\ngot his crotch. Steve moaned catching Tony\u2019s lips into a heated kiss drinking\nhim in. \u00a0Tony pulled away panting. </p><p>\u201cYou feel so good in my arms and in my lap Tony,\u201d Steve\nreminded Tony. Tony keened and kept grinding down on Steve\u2019s hard cock through\ntheir jeans. \u201cYou are going to make me cum in my pants like a teenager baby.\u201d\nSteve grunted as he guided Tony\u2019s hips back and forth over his crotch. </p><p>Tony whimpered, \u201cYou won\u2019t be the only one coming in their\npants sweetheart.\u201d Tony speed up his tempo as he got closer to his orgasm.\nWithout warning Steve came hard and hot against his jeans Tony still grinding\ninto him. Tony felt the front of Steve\u2019s jeans dampen and the wet spot appear.\nTony bit his lip and gasped as he came in his pants. They were both coming down\nfrom there highs snuggled into the couch Tony had in his lab.</p><p>Steve broke the silence, \u201cBaby boy we need to clean up.\u201d\nTony nodded unsure if his choice would work right now. He grabbed Steve\u2019s hand\nand led them up to his suite to clean up. Once they had cleaned themselves and\nchanged. They both climbed into Tony\u2019s bed and fell asleep exhausted from their\norgasm and not having each other for over 4 years. </p><p>Meanwhile on the other side of the tower Bucky had caught up\nwith Nat while she was training. </p><p>\u201cHey Natalia,\u201d Bucky called out. </p><p>Nat rolled her eyes at him, \u201cHello James. Why have you come\nto disturb me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have not come to disturb you but to let you know that\nSteve agreed to the open relationship. We can rekindle that romance we had Nat.\nI missed the things we did together,\u201d Bucky stated plainly. </p><p>Nat quirked her brow, \u201cI do too. I hated when they sent you\nto Siberia. After that they used me for the worst jobs possible and then I left.\nI couldn\u2019t deal being without you James.\u201d Nat stepped closer to Bucky. \u201cDo you\nwant to help me train for a bit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would be fun we used to train together all the time I\nmiss that Natalia,\u201d Bucky responded. Nat smirked and pointed to the mats. </p><p>They squared each other up on the mats before Bucky made the\nfirst move. He lunged at her and grabbed her wrist. Nat got out of his grip quick\nand kicked him in the stomach. Bucky grabbed her leg and flung her to the\nground. He climbed over her pinning her to the mat. He held her arms above her\nhead and his legs pinned her legs down. </p><p>\u201cLooks like I won doll,\u201d Bucky gloated. </p><p>\u201cNot yet James,\u201d Nat leaned up and kissed him passionately. Bucky\nwas caught off guard and Nat rolled them over. Nat pinned his hands as she\nkissed down his neck. </p><p>Bucky groaned, \u201cI want to feel you Natalia. I missed how you\nfeel against me.\u201d Nat smiled and started to kiss down Bucky\u2019s body. Nat reached\nhis sweats and yanked them down. Bucky never wears underwear under his sweats\nso his cock bobbed against his stomach hard and leaking. Nat pulled off her\npants and sank down on Bucky\u2019s length. </p><p>\u201cJames, you feel so good,\u201d Nat mentioned as she bounced on\nhis hard cock. Bucky moaned as his hands moved to grip her hips tight guiding\nher on his length. Nat whimpered when he hit her spot inside that made her go\nweak in the knees. Nat continued to grind down in Bucky\u2019s cock. </p><p>\u201cFuck Nat, you feel so good around me. I am not going to\nlast much longer,\u201d Bucky managed to get out before he rolled Nat to fuck into\nher hard. \u201cI\u2019m going to cum Nat.\u201d</p><p>Nat moaned, \u201cIn me James.

I didn\u2019t\nrealize I wanted to be with them romantically or sexually until as of late.\nThey would be good with it. We used to kind of be together like how we were\nbefore I found you again. I miss him just like I missed you.\u201d </p><p>With Steve\u2019s rambling Bucky knew who he was talking about.\nHe grabbed Steve and pulled him into cuddle, \u201cIt\u2019s okay baby. I know you and\nTony had a thing before I came back. I should have realized that wasn\u2019t going\nto go away when I came back. I know you tried but you have some much love to\ngive Stevie. You want to be with me and Tony baby doll?\u201d</p><p>Steve nodded as Bucky kissed his head. \u201cI just want you to\nbe happy to Buck. I don\u2019t want you to see me with someone else and get jealous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaby, I have someone else too. You know me and Nat go way\nback. I don\u2019t think you know that before I was just the asset. I still was\nBucky. They didn\u2019t brainwash me a ton to where I didn\u2019t know who I was. I still\nhad some semblance of myself. The only thing was I didn\u2019t remember you at all.\nI was training the girls in the Red Room Academy. Nat was one of those girls.\nShe was 18 when we started to fall for each other,\u201d Bucky tucked his face into\nSteve\u2019s hair as he continued to tell the story. \u201cWe kept it a secret as long as\nwe could from Hydra. We both knew if they caught us, I would be sent to Siberia\nand completely wiped. We were careful for 2 years. Then We slipped up. They\ncaught us and shipped me off to Siberia where I was wiped to where I didn\u2019t remember\nanyone. Then they used me as a weapon. Kept me on ice until they needed me.\nThey would thaw me out and use me. They used me to train others like me. They\nused me to kill. I forgot all about you and Nat. That was until you saved me\nStevie.\u201d Bucky kissed his head and squeezed him tight. \u201cNat and I have been\ntalking about rekindling the relationship to see if it would be able to work. I\njust needed to make sure my baby doll was on board.\u201d</p><p>Steve snuggled into Bucky tighter, \u201cIf it makes you happy\nBuck. Then I am all for it. I think it would be good for you and Nat. You both\nhave some stories and history that no one can understand but you too. I Can\nhave my engineer and you can have your lethal assassin.\u201d Steve smirked as he\nturned his head to kiss Bucky. As soon as their lips met Bucky deepened the\nkiss. </p><p>Bucky whispered against Steve\u2019s soft pliable lips, \u201cYou know\nat some point we can probably have a foursome. It would be fun to see you fuck\nNat and me take Tony apart bit by bit. I sometimes fantasize about baby. You\nthink you little engineer would be down sometime? I know Nat would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am sure I can motivate Tony. I would be pretty hot to see\nyou take Tony apart and then put him back together. He needs maintenance to\nkeep him in check. It helps with his PTSD,\u201d Steve smirked against Bucky\u2019s\nmouth. Steve bit gently at Bucky\u2019s lower lip. \u201cWe need to let them know we can\nbe with them too. I was thinking of breaking the news to Tony by making in dinner\nand being a romantic I could have never been with Howard back then.\u201d</p><p>Bucky laughed, \u201cI forgot you and Howard were a thing there\nfor a while. Everyone though sweet Steve Rogers (Captain America) was a virgin.\nNo one knew how much of a slut you really were especially after the serum. You\ngained all that muscle and body. I wanted to jump you every chance I got. Didn\u2019t\nwe have a threesome with Peggy, you and me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah Buck, we did. Peggy was the Dom in that scene. She\ntreated her pets really well. Howard walked in on us and we dragged him into\nplaying. It turned into a foursome. I remember Howard bending you over the\nvanity in the room making you watch yourself as he fucked your ass hard and\ngood,\u201d Steve remembered quite fondly. </p><p>\u201cWe all really fondued huh,\u201d Bucky joked. Steve shook his\nhead. </p><p>\u201cAll 3 of you never let me live that down,\u201d Steve responded\nblushing. \u201cI may not have been a virgin but I was uncultured. I had never\ntraveled outside of Brooklyn before the war. My first time in Europe and I\nsaved your ass. We didn\u2019t have money so I had no idea that fondue was cheese,\nbread and fruit. I never had French food before.\u201d </p><p>Bucky wrapped around Steve more even though Steve was a\nlittle upset about the fondue joke again. They stayed like that for a while. </p><p>The next day Steve got some flowers and candy to woo Tony.\nSteve was nervous since he didn\u2019t know if Tony would be okay with sharing him. Tony\nand Pepper have been on the outs for the last few years. Tony works way too\nmuch. Steve grabs the roses he bought for Tony and headed down to Tony\u2019s lab. </p><p>\u201cHey capsicle,\u201d Tony cheerily says. </p><p>\u201cHey Tony. I have some things for you. I wanted to talk to\nyou,\u201d Steve shily mentions. </p><p>\u201cWhat do you want to talk about Steven,\u201d Tony looks at him\nquestioningly. </p><p>\u201cThese are for you,\u201d Steve hands over the flowers and chocolates\nhe had hand picked for Tony. </p><p>\u201cThank you Capsicle,\u201d Tony smiled. Tony smelled the roses\nand looked at the chocolates. \u201cYou know what chocolates I enjoy Steve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome precious,\u201d Steve let slip. </p><p>\u201cPrecious huh,\u201d Tony questioned. </p><p>Steve blushed from the roots of his hair to his toes, \u201cThat\nis what I wanted to talk with you about. Come sit down with me on the couch\nthat you have in here.\u201d Tony sat down with Steve on the couch. \u201cHow would you\nlike to go on a date Tony?\u201d</p><p>Tony looked at Steve confused, \u201cAre you and Buckaroo good?\u201d</p><p>Steve smiled and nodded, \u201cYeah Tony, Bucky and I are good. We\ndecided to open up our relationship and date others outside of me and Bucky.\nBucky is going to start dating Nat and I wanted to date you. I missed being with\nyou my precious boy.\u201d</p><p>Tony straddled Steve\u2019s lap on the couch, \u201cI missed you too Steve.\nI hate that we ended things because I couldn\u2019t be in the same room as Bucky and\nthat drove you and him closer together. If I hadn\u2019t hated him so much, we\nprobably would have still been together.\u201d Tony leaned in and nipped at Steve\u2019s jaw.\nSteve whimpered pushing his head to the side and allowing Tony access to his\nneck. Tony bit and sucked on Steve\u2019s neck leaving marks he knew that were going\nto fade by tomorrow. </p><p>\u201cFuck, I missed you Tony,\u201d Steve placed his hands-on Tony\u2019s\nass as he thrusted his hips up into Tony\u2019s.</p><p>Tony moaned into Steve\u2019s neck, \u201cFuck I missed you too Capsicle.\nYou feel so good.\u201d Tony ran his hands down Steve\u2019s chest and palmed him when he\ngot his crotch. Steve moaned catching Tony\u2019s lips into a heated kiss drinking\nhim in. \u00a0Tony pulled away panting. </p><p>\u201cYou feel so good in my arms and in my lap Tony,\u201d Steve\nreminded Tony. Tony keened and kept grinding down on Steve\u2019s hard cock through\ntheir jeans. \u201cYou are going to make me cum in my pants like a teenager baby.\u201d\nSteve grunted as he guided Tony\u2019s hips back and forth over his crotch. </p><p>Tony whimpered, \u201cYou won\u2019t be the only one coming in their\npants sweetheart.\u201d Tony speed up his tempo as he got closer to his orgasm.\nWithout warning Steve came hard and hot against his jeans Tony still grinding\ninto him. Tony felt the front of Steve\u2019s jeans dampen and the wet spot appear.\nTony bit his lip and gasped as he came in his pants. They were both coming down\nfrom there highs snuggled into the couch Tony had in his lab.</p><p>Steve broke the silence, \u201cBaby boy we need to clean up.\u201d\nTony nodded unsure if his choice would work right now. He grabbed Steve\u2019s hand\nand led them up to his suite to clean up. Once they had cleaned themselves and\nchanged. They both climbed into Tony\u2019s bed and fell asleep exhausted from their\norgasm and not having each other for over 4 years. </p><p>Meanwhile on the other side of the tower Bucky had caught up\nwith Nat while she was training. </p><p>\u201cHey Natalia,\u201d Bucky called out. </p><p>Nat rolled her eyes at him, \u201cHello James. Why have you come\nto disturb me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have not come to disturb you but to let you know that\nSteve agreed to the open relationship. We can rekindle that romance we had Nat.\nI missed the things we did together,\u201d Bucky stated plainly. </p><p>Nat quirked her brow, \u201cI do too. I hated when they sent you\nto Siberia. After that they used me for the worst jobs possible and then I left.\nI couldn\u2019t deal being without you James.\u201d Nat stepped closer to Bucky. \u201cDo you\nwant to help me train for a bit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would be fun we used to train together all the time I\nmiss that Natalia,\u201d Bucky responded. Nat smirked and pointed to the mats. </p><p>They squared each other up on the mats before Bucky made the\nfirst move. He lunged at her and grabbed her wrist. Nat got out of his grip quick\nand kicked him in the stomach. Bucky grabbed her leg and flung her to the\nground. He climbed over her pinning her to the mat. He held her arms above her\nhead and his legs pinned her legs down. </p><p>\u201cLooks like I won doll,\u201d Bucky gloated. </p><p>\u201cNot yet James,\u201d Nat leaned up and kissed him passionately. Bucky\nwas caught off guard and Nat rolled them over. Nat pinned his hands as she\nkissed down his neck. </p><p>Bucky groaned, \u201cI want to feel you Natalia. I missed how you\nfeel against me.\u201d Nat smiled and started to kiss down Bucky\u2019s body. Nat reached\nhis sweats and yanked them down. Bucky never wears underwear under his sweats\nso his cock bobbed against his stomach hard and leaking. Nat pulled off her\npants and sank down on Bucky\u2019s length. </p><p>\u201cJames, you feel so good,\u201d Nat mentioned as she bounced on\nhis hard cock. Bucky moaned as his hands moved to grip her hips tight guiding\nher on his length. Nat whimpered when he hit her spot inside that made her go\nweak in the knees. Nat continued to grind down in Bucky\u2019s cock. </p><p>\u201cFuck Nat, you feel so good around me. I am not going to\nlast much longer,\u201d Bucky managed to get out before he rolled Nat to fuck into\nher hard. \u201cI\u2019m going to cum Nat.\u201d</p><p>Nat moaned, \u201cIn me James. Do not pull out.\u201d Nat wrapped her\nlegs around Bucky\u2019s waist tight as he fucked her hard and rough. </p><p>\u201cAhhh, Natalia. Fuck,\u201d Bucky stammered out as he came hard\nand hot splashing your walls leaving them white. Nat\u2019s mouth opened in a silent\nscream as he spasmed around him prolonging his orgasm. When they both finished\nTony had walked in with Steve after their nap.</p><p>\u201cI guess that means we need to clean the gym,\u201d Tony laughed.\n</p><p>\u201cBuck, couldn\u2019t stop yourself from taking Nat in the gym,\u201d\nSteve said. </p><p>Lazily Bucky responded, \u201cIt was amazing and got hot and\nheavy fast.\u201d Nat just smiled. \u201cNatalia, we need to go clean up and rest doll.\u201d\nNat nodded closing her eyes. </p><p>As Bucky carried Nat out of the gym to his room Tony yelled,\n\u201cWe can all go out on a date together.\u201d</p><p>Steve and Bucky were happy that they decided to open up\ntheir relationship to allow others in that they cared about. </p><hr><p>If you enjoy what I am writing please share and leave comments</p><hr><p>Tags:\u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m3oVXVm_CJfrBWJsvf7wX4Q\">@buckmesideways22</a>\u200b\u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mqxDvzYHIURsqyeLxAxvjAA\">@oleanderbat</a>\u00a0,\u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m9v8ajhd6t5wfTs1f0PkvRw\">@buckyzgurl</a>\u00a0,\u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m5epc-hzKPMotrgHL5skymA\">@scarletsoldierrr</a>\u00a0,\u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m5NW0zL_2pD_-r52QHj8JSg\">@kombatfather1796</a></p>",

Nat was one of those girls.\nShe was 18 when we started to fall for each other,\u201d Bucky tucked his face into\nSteve\u2019s hair as he continued to tell the story. \u201cWe kept it a secret as long as\nwe could from Hydra. We both knew if they caught us, I would be sent to Siberia\nand completely wiped. We were careful for 2 years. Then We slipped up. They\ncaught us and shipped me off to Siberia where I was wiped to where I didn\u2019t remember\nanyone. Then they used me as a weapon. Kept me on ice until they needed me.\nThey would thaw me out and use me. They used me to train others like me. They\nused me to kill. I forgot all about you and Nat. That was until you saved me\nStevie.\u201d Bucky kissed his head and squeezed him tight. \u201cNat and I have been\ntalking about rekindling the relationship to see if it would be able to work. I\njust needed to make sure my baby doll was on board.\u201d</p><p>Steve snuggled into Bucky tighter, \u201cIf it makes you happy\nBuck. Then I am all for it. I think it would be good for you and Nat. You both\nhave some stories and history that no one can understand but you too. I Can\nhave my engineer and you can have your lethal assassin.\u201d Steve smirked as he\nturned his head to kiss Bucky. As soon as their lips met Bucky deepened the\nkiss. </p><p>Bucky whispered against Steve\u2019s soft pliable lips, \u201cYou know\nat some point we can probably have a foursome. It would be fun to see you fuck\nNat and me take Tony apart bit by bit. I sometimes fantasize about baby. You\nthink you little engineer would be down sometime? I know Nat would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am sure I can motivate Tony. I would be pretty hot to see\nyou take Tony apart and then put him back together. He needs maintenance to\nkeep him in check. It helps with his PTSD,\u201d Steve smirked against Bucky\u2019s\nmouth. Steve bit gently at Bucky\u2019s lower lip. \u201cWe need to let them know we can\nbe with them too. I was thinking of breaking the news to Tony by making in dinner\nand being a romantic I could have never been with Howard back then.\u201d</p><p>Bucky laughed, \u201cI forgot you and Howard were a thing there\nfor a while. Everyone though sweet Steve Rogers (Captain America) was a virgin.\nNo one knew how much of a slut you really were especially after the serum. You\ngained all that muscle and body. I wanted to jump you every chance I got. Didn\u2019t\nwe have a threesome with Peggy, you and me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah Buck, we did. Peggy was the Dom in that scene. She\ntreated her pets really well. Howard walked in on us and we dragged him into\nplaying. It turned into a foursome. I remember Howard bending you over the\nvanity in the room making you watch yourself as he fucked your ass hard and\ngood,\u201d Steve remembered quite fondly. </p><p>\u201cWe all really fondued huh,\u201d Bucky joked. Steve shook his\nhead. </p><p>\u201cAll 3 of you never let me live that down,\u201d Steve responded\nblushing. \u201cI may not have been a virgin but I was uncultured. I had never\ntraveled outside of Brooklyn before the war. My first time in Europe and I\nsaved your ass. We didn\u2019t have money so I had no idea that fondue was cheese,\nbread and fruit. I never had French food before.\u201d </p><p>Bucky wrapped around Steve more even though Steve was a\nlittle upset about the fondue joke again. They stayed like that for a while. </p><p>The next day Steve got some flowers and candy to woo Tony.\nSteve was nervous since he didn\u2019t know if Tony would be okay with sharing him. Tony\nand Pepper have been on the outs for the last few years. Tony works way too\nmuch. Steve grabs the roses he bought for Tony and headed down to Tony\u2019s lab. </p><p>\u201cHey capsicle,\u201d Tony cheerily says. </p><p>\u201cHey Tony. I have some things for you. I wanted to talk to\nyou,\u201d Steve shily mentions. </p><p>\u201cWhat do you want to talk about Steven,\u201d Tony looks at him\nquestioningly. </p><p>\u201cThese are for you,\u201d Steve hands over the flowers and chocolates\nhe had hand picked for Tony. </p><p>\u201cThank you Capsicle,\u201d Tony smiled. Tony smelled the roses\nand looked at the chocolates. \u201cYou know what chocolates I enjoy Steve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome precious,\u201d Steve let slip. </p><p>\u201cPrecious huh,\u201d Tony questioned. </p><p>Steve blushed from the roots of his hair to his toes, \u201cThat\nis what I wanted to talk with you about. Come sit down with me on the couch\nthat you have in here.\u201d Tony sat down with Steve on the couch. \u201cHow would you\nlike to go on a date Tony?\u201d</p><p>Tony looked at Steve confused, \u201cAre you and Buckaroo good?\u201d</p><p>Steve smiled and nodded, \u201cYeah Tony, Bucky and I are good. We\ndecided to open up our relationship and date others outside of me and Bucky.\nBucky is going to start dating Nat and I wanted to date you. I missed being with\nyou my precious boy.\u201d</p><p>Tony straddled Steve\u2019s lap on the couch, \u201cI missed you too Steve.\nI hate that we ended things because I couldn\u2019t be in the same room as Bucky and\nthat drove you and him closer together. If I hadn\u2019t hated him so much, we\nprobably would have still been together.\u201d Tony leaned in and nipped at Steve\u2019s jaw.\nSteve whimpered pushing his head to the side and allowing Tony access to his\nneck. Tony bit and sucked on Steve\u2019s neck leaving marks he knew that were going\nto fade by tomorrow. </p><p>\u201cFuck, I missed you Tony,\u201d Steve placed his hands-on Tony\u2019s\nass as he thrusted his hips up into Tony\u2019s.</p><p>Tony moaned into Steve\u2019s neck, \u201cFuck I missed you too Capsicle.\nYou feel so good.\u201d Tony ran his hands down Steve\u2019s chest and palmed him when he\ngot his crotch. Steve moaned catching Tony\u2019s lips into a heated kiss drinking\nhim in. \u00a0Tony pulled away panting. </p><p>\u201cYou feel so good in my arms and in my lap Tony,\u201d Steve\nreminded Tony. Tony keened and kept grinding down on Steve\u2019s hard cock through\ntheir jeans. \u201cYou are going to make me cum in my pants like a teenager baby.\u201d\nSteve grunted as he guided Tony\u2019s hips back and forth over his crotch. </p><p>Tony whimpered, \u201cYou won\u2019t be the only one coming in their\npants sweetheart.\u201d Tony speed up his tempo as he got closer to his orgasm.\nWithout warning Steve came hard and hot against his jeans Tony still grinding\ninto him. Tony felt the front of Steve\u2019s jeans dampen and the wet spot appear.\nTony bit his lip and gasped as he came in his pants. They were both coming down\nfrom there highs snuggled into the couch Tony had in his lab.</p><p>Steve broke the silence, \u201cBaby boy we need to clean up.\u201d\nTony nodded unsure if his choice would work right now. He grabbed Steve\u2019s hand\nand led them up to his suite to clean up. Once they had cleaned themselves and\nchanged. They both climbed into Tony\u2019s bed and fell asleep exhausted from their\norgasm and not having each other for over 4 years. </p><p>Meanwhile on the other side of the tower Bucky had caught up\nwith Nat while she was training. </p><p>\u201cHey Natalia,\u201d Bucky called out. </p><p>Nat rolled her eyes at him, \u201cHello James. Why have you come\nto disturb me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have not come to disturb you but to let you know that\nSteve agreed to the open relationship. We can rekindle that romance we had Nat.\nI missed the things we did together,\u201d Bucky stated plainly. </p><p>Nat quirked her brow, \u201cI do too. I hated when they sent you\nto Siberia. After that they used me for the worst jobs possible and then I left.\nI couldn\u2019t deal being without you James.\u201d Nat stepped closer to Bucky. \u201cDo you\nwant to help me train for a bit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would be fun we used to train together all the time I\nmiss that Natalia,\u201d Bucky responded. Nat smirked and pointed to the mats. </p><p>They squared each other up on the mats before Bucky made the\nfirst move. He lunged at her and grabbed her wrist. Nat got out of his grip quick\nand kicked him in the stomach. Bucky grabbed her leg and flung her to the\nground. He climbed over her pinning her to the mat. He held her arms above her\nhead and his legs pinned her legs down. </p><p>\u201cLooks like I won doll,\u201d Bucky gloated. </p><p>\u201cNot yet James,\u201d Nat leaned up and kissed him passionately. Bucky\nwas caught off guard and Nat rolled them over. Nat pinned his hands as she\nkissed down his neck. </p><p>Bucky groaned, \u201cI want to feel you Natalia. I missed how you\nfeel against me.\u201d Nat smiled and started to kiss down Bucky\u2019s body. Nat reached\nhis sweats and yanked them down. Bucky never wears underwear under his sweats\nso his cock bobbed against his stomach hard and leaking. Nat pulled off her\npants and sank down on Bucky\u2019s length. </p><p>\u201cJames, you feel so good,\u201d Nat mentioned as she bounced on\nhis hard cock. Bucky moaned as his hands moved to grip her hips tight guiding\nher on his length. Nat whimpered when he hit her spot inside that made her go\nweak in the knees. Nat continued to grind down in Bucky\u2019s cock. </p><p>\u201cFuck Nat, you feel so good around me. I am not going to\nlast much longer,\u201d Bucky managed to get out before he rolled Nat to fuck into\nher hard. \u201cI\u2019m going to cum Nat.\u201d</p><p>Nat moaned, \u201cIn me James. Do not pull out.\u201d Nat wrapped her\nlegs around Bucky\u2019s waist tight as he fucked her hard and rough. </p><p>\u201cAhhh, Natalia. Fuck,\u201d Bucky stammered out as he came hard\nand hot splashing your walls leaving them white. Nat\u2019s mouth opened in a silent\nscream as he spasmed around him prolonging his orgasm. When they both finished\nTony had walked in with Steve after their nap.</p><p>\u201cI guess that means we need to clean the gym,\u201d Tony laughed.\n</p><p>\u201cBuck, couldn\u2019t stop yourself from taking Nat in the gym,\u201d\nSteve said. </p><p>Lazily Bucky responded, \u201cIt was amazing and got hot and\nheavy fast.\u201d Nat just smiled. \u201cNatalia, we need to go clean up and rest doll.\u201d\nNat nodded closing her eyes. </p><p>As Bucky carried Nat out of the gym to his room Tony yelled,\n\u201cWe can all go out on a date together.\u201d</p><p>Steve and Bucky were happy that they decided to open up\ntheir relationship to allow others in that they cared about. </p><hr><p>If you enjoy what I am writing please share and leave comments</p><hr><p>Tags:\u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m3oVXVm_CJfrBWJsvf7wX4Q\">@buckmesideways22</a>\u200b\u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mqxDvzYHIURsqyeLxAxvjAA\">@oleanderbat</a>\u00a0,\u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m9v8ajhd6t5wfTs1f0PkvRw\">@buckyzgurl</a>\u00a0,\u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m5epc-hzKPMotrgHL5skymA\">@scarletsoldierrr</a>\u00a0,\u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m5NW0zL_2pD_-r52QHj8JSg\">@kombatfather1796</a></p>",

He followed Steve to the\ncouch in their living room and sat down sprawled out. &ldquo;What do you want to talk\nabout Stevie?&rdquo;</p><p>Steve sat down staring at Bucky, &ldquo;You know I love you. I\nfeel like something is missing from our relationship. I am wanting us to have\nan open relationship.&rdquo; Steve ducked his head avoiding Bucky&rsquo;s eyes. </p><p>&ldquo;You mean like we used to back in the 30&rsquo;s and 40&rsquo;s. When I\nused to bring girls home and then after you rescued me from Azzano you and\nPeggy,&rdquo; Bucky responded like it was normal to talk about. Steve nodded afraid Bucky\nwas going to get mad. &ldquo;Poor baby, I am not going to get mad sweetheart. I am\ngood with us being in an open relationship. We both get to be with each other\nand other people as well. Did you have anyone in mind is that why you are\nasking?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah Buck,&rdquo; Steve was blushing. &ldquo;I have someone in mind. I didn&rsquo;t\nrealize I wanted to be with them romantically or sexually until as of late.\nThey would be good with it. We used to kind of be together like how we were\nbefore I found you again.

He followed Steve to the\ncouch in their living room and sat down sprawled out. &ldquo;What do you want to talk\nabout Stevie?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Steve sat down staring at Bucky, &ldquo;You know I love you. I\nfeel like something is missing from our relationship. I am wanting us to have\nan open relationship.&rdquo; Steve ducked his head avoiding Bucky&rsquo;s eyes. </p>\n<p>&ldquo;You mean like we used to back in the 30&rsquo;s and 40&rsquo;s. When I\nused to bring girls home and then after you rescued me from Azzano you and\nPeggy,&rdquo; Bucky responded like it was normal to talk about. Steve nodded afraid Bucky\nwas going to get mad. &ldquo;Poor baby, I am not going to get mad sweetheart. I am\ngood with us being in an open relationship. We both get to be with each other\nand other people as well. Did you have anyone in mind is that why you are\nasking?&rdquo;</p>\n</p>",
