                "content": "<p>I know this doesnt matter to most people in the GOT fandom but I really fucking hate the way they undermined Jon and Arya&rsquo;s relationship. It&rsquo;s very depressing how they rarely mention each other, barely have any screentime together, how little impact they have in each others story when in canon they&rsquo;re supposed to be each others home and heart. It&rsquo;s the unconditional love these two have for one another that sheds light into the violent world the books have portrayed. Both of them are literally willing to kill and die for another if they have to,,,and all of THAT its reduced to complete indifference???? Doesnt any of that mean anything???Like all D&amp;D have done so far is remind the audience that their relationship is supposed to be special in interviews once or twice,,,and that&rsquo;s it. Literally.</p><p>Like I said, I know most people in the fandom dont seem to care about Jon and Arya&rsquo;s bond or Arya or even Jon to point this out but it&rsquo;s truly tragic how they swept this meaningful relationship under the rug.</p>",

They had no home. They were at the mercy of others who opened their home to them on the expectation that one day their family would rise to power again. </p><p>When we meet Dany at the beginning of the show, she and Viserys are in a desperate place. They have maybe run out of generosity and basically trade Dany to have some leverage for themselves to survive. Once Dany loses Drogo, she is again without a place in the world, unless she makes one for herself. Like Arya after Ned&rsquo;s death, she has to find something to hold onto. Some giant goal that she will pursue with blinders so that she can make it through the uncertainty and come out on top. </p><p>Both Dany and Arya are seeking power so that they may have a place in the world and protect themselves. There comes a place where both feel like they have no family left in the world to turn to. This is where their paths diverge, and create a foil. </p><p>Dany gets the power to kill handed to her by fate when she hatched the dragons. Arya also seeks out the power to kill, but she is an apprentice of death. Her journey involves learning rules of balance and rules of restraint in the House of Black and White.</p><p>Danny&rsquo;s tragic flaw is that she fails to comprehend that only death can pay for life, and vice versa. Or, that she is willing to agree to those terms. You can&rsquo;t have one without the other. It&rsquo;s the House of Black AND White. Arya does not receive the power to kill until she has learned to also temper her killer instincts. </p><p>There is a wonderful parallel in the last episode where both Dany and Arya have within their reach the dreams that they first committed themselves to and have been striving towards since the moment their lost their place in the world and needed something to hold onto. However, Arya has the perspective to walk away from her childhood goals, because she has had lessons in tempering her instincts and understands the rules of balance and the true costs of taking lives. </p><p>Dany&rsquo;s journey has not included an education in applying her killing power. Both Arya and Dany use death to deliver justice, so long as their paths run parallel, however there is more to death than justice. There are natural laws and consequences that govern the taking of a life, which have nothing to do with justice. Arya is willing to let go of her dream of assasinating Cersei, because Arya is not willing to pay the costs associated (I guess, giving her own life). Dany chooses differently.</p>",
