After I had finished, I grabbed\nmy backpack, and left. I had practiced driving to Midtown three times since I\nhad left the football field, but I still put it in my GPS just in case. There\nwas more traffic in the morning, which I had planned for. I arrived about two\nhours before school officially started, which was my plan. I enter the school\nbuilding at 6:15. I head for the front office and tell the lady I\u2019m a new\nstudent. In forty-five minutes, I\u2019m walking back out with a fresh, official\nschedule. I still have over an hour before school starts, so I ask for\ndirections to the training room. The lady tells me, and I thank her before\ntrudging my way towards the other end of the school. I find what I\u2019m looking\nfor, the name \u2018<i>Sydney Baker, AT\u2019</i>\nprinted on the door tells me I\u2019ve found the right place. I knock before placing\nmy hand on the door handle.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cCome in!\u201d\nI hear, and I push open the door to see the biggest training room I\u2019ve ever\nbeen in. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWoah.\u201d I\nsay, looking around. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A tall\nwoman approaches me, with a I-need-more-coffee face on. \u201cCan I help you?\u201d She\nasks, eyeing me. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHi yes,\nmy name is Raine, I just transferred in this morning and I-\u201c</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She turns,\npulling a paper packet off her desk. \u201cFill these out and have a doctor fill\nthem and sign off and then we can get you playing. What sports do you play?\u201d\nShe asks, sitting down at her desk and booting up her computer.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOh no,\nyou misunderstand. I\u2019m here to see if you need any football trainers,\u201d I\nshuffle around in my bag until I find the paper I\u2019m looking for, \u201cthis is a\nletter of recommendation from my former head trainer in Tennessee.\u201d She takes\nthe paper from me, reading silently. I look around as she reads, taking in all\ntheir equipment. It all looks state of the art, brand-new. I\u2019m focusing in on\ntheir ice machine when she clears her throat.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou come\nvery highly recommended.\u201d She states, looking over the letter once again. \u201cIf\nyou\u2019re as good as they say you are then you can come work for me. We don\u2019t get\na lot of kids who come to train so it\u2019d just be me and you.\u201d I nod, grinning.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThank you\nso much. I love training, it\u2019s my entire life to be honest.\u201d I say, shifting\nthe weight of my backpack. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThe only\nrequirements are that you have good grades, come to practice twice a week, and\nof course all games, here and away.\u201d I nod, expecting no less. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI\u2019ll be\nhere. Do you need me today?\u201d I ask, eager to get my hands on all the new\nequipment I\u2019m spying. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIf you\nwant. Practice starts as soon as the school day is over.\u201d I nod and shake her\nhand. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI\u2019ll be\nhere.\u201d I say, turning to leave.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I get to\nthe front entrance with ten minutes to spare. I see Ned and Peter standing with\na tall girl. Ned sees me first, waving. <a>\u201cHey!\u201d He yells,\ncausing Peter and the girl to turn and wave at me too. </a></p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHey!\u201d I say, jogging to close the\ndistance between all of us. \u201cSorry I\u2019m late. I had somethings to do before\nschool started.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s cool. MJ, this is Raine.\nRaine, MJ.\u201d Ned says, nodding towards the girl. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She sticks her hand out. \u201cSo, you\u2019re\nthe pretty truck girl these guys couldn\u2019t shut up about all weekend. Well they\nweren\u2019t wrong about you being pretty. I\u2019m MJ.\u201d I take her hand as the boys both\nprotest.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHey!\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWe did not talk about her all\nweekend!\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I laugh at them both while MJ\nsmiles. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOh yeah, you all didn\u2019t tell me\nabout her milk chocolate eyes, perfect teeth, and perfectly curly hair? Did I\ndream you all telling me that stuff? Because it all seems to be true.\u201d Her\neyebrows raise, and I laugh some more.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cMJ!\u201d Peter groans, and Ned\nnervously chuckles.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHey, I\u2019m more than okay to hear\nabout her over Liiiiiz, Parker.\u201d MJ teases. This time Ned laughs.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWait who\u2019s Liz?\u201d I ask, looking\nbetween them all.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cNo one!\u201d Peter quickly quips up,\nturning red. \u201cWill you please not say that so loud?\u201d He asks, looking over his\nshoulders.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cLiz,\u201d Peter makes shushing noise\ntowards MJ, but she continues, \u201cis the love of Peter\u2019s life. He\u2019s had a crush\non her since freshman year, but she\u2019s popular, a senior, and doesn\u2019t know that\nPeter even exists. So, him and Ned stalk her every chance they get.\u201d MJ dishes,\nmuch to Peter\u2019s horror.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOoo well then I feel special if I\nmade such an impression on you two if I trumped Liz.\u201d I say, grinning, Peter\nsmiles at me. MJ asks for my schedule and I hand it over to her, we all start\nwalking in what I guess is the direction of my class. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI have second period general\nphysics with you. These two both have advanced physics.\u201d She says jerking her\nfinger towards the boys who have fallen in step behind us. They\u2019re whispering\nto each other but nod when she mentions them. She stops walking, and we all\ncome to a grinding halt. \u201cThis is your class room Raine, Algebra II with\nLackluster. I\u2019ll pick you up after and take you to physics.\u201d I nod but the boys\nboth start to kick up a storm. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHey, I can come get her no\nproblem!\u201d Ned says, while Peter nods.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou two both have class on the\nother side of the school. And I have our next class with her, so it makes\nsense. You two can drool over her later.\u201d MJ replies, and the boys complain\nagain.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThanks guys, but I really don\u2019t\nneed y\u2019all to make an extra trip just for me. I\u2019ll be fine with MJ.\u201d They both\nlook disappointed but agree. We all say our goodbyes as the bell rings. I duck\ninto the class and quickly scan the room. There seems to be two seats left, one\nin the front where a bunch of the stoners seem to be, and one near the middle\nwhere a bunch of popular kids seem to be sitting. I take my chances on the\npopular kids, taking my seat.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0By the\ntime my last three classes roll around I\u2019m already tired. But as soon as I see\nPeter I perk back up. I see him waiting near the door for my last class,\npresumably to pick me up. But his eyes seemed trained on something out of my\nrange of vision. I walk towards him looking in the direction he is. I get\nnearer to him when I see a pretty girl around the corner. She is pulling books\nout of her locker the front of the locker has magnetic letters that spell \u2018Liz\u2019\nout on the front. And suddenly, what he\u2019s staring at makes sense. I sneak up by\nhim, whispering \u201cWhatcha looking at Peter?\u201d In his ear, scaring him. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOh! Huh?\nI wasn\u2019t staring at her-anything! I wasn\u2019t staring at anything!\u201d He says, all\njumpy. A soft smile plays on my lips. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cShe\nreally is pretty. Do you talk to her? Like have you tried?\u201d I ask, falling in\nstep with him. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOh no. I\nthink she likes Flash, they\u2019re together a lot.\u201d He says, shrugging. \u201cBesides MJ\nwas over playing it. I didn\u2019t have a huge crush on her.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cDid?\nThat\u2019s past tense Pete.\u201d He shrugs, his fingers looped through his backpack\nstraps. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cShe\u2019s\npretty, but you know as time goes on, I realize being pretty doesn\u2019t add up to\neverything. Personality is a lot of it. We\u2019re here.\u201d He says, opening the door\nfor me.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I nod,\nfollowing him to his seat. \u201cHere, the seat beside me is free. Ned was\noriginally in here, but he dropped it to take Comp Shop.\u201d Peter pats the seat\nnext to him. I put my backpack on the floor and take my seat. Soon the teacher\nenters, and my mouth hangs open. I was expecting and older lady, but the woman\nin front of me can\u2019t possibly be thirty yet, but she is strikingly beautiful. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cPeter how\ndo you not pay attention to <i>that</i>?\u201d I\nask, dumb founded. She flicks her blonde hair over her shoulder writing \u2018<i>Mesopotamia</i>\u2019 on the board. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The boy\nshrugs his shoulders. \u201cI guess she\u2019s not my type. Besides, every boy in here\ndegrades her and the <i>things</i> they say\nabout her, it\u2019s sick.\u201d I smile at him softly. Almost as if to make his point,\nshe drops her marker. She hasn\u2019t even bent over to pick it up and the boys in\nthe back whoop and holler at the prospect of her having to bend over. She casts\nan icy gaze on the boys with her blue green eyes, kicks the marker under her\ndesk and then pulls a new one out of her desk. I grin at her antics, knowing\nfull well that she\u2019s doing it on purpose. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The bell\nrings, and she begins to take attendance. She gets towards the bottom of her\nattendance sheet when she pauses. \u201cElizabeth Workapick?\u201d She calls out scanning\nthe room. The boys in the back all make a fuss over my name. Believe me I\u2019ve\nheard every play on the name Workapick. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I stand\nup, and one of the boys let out a whistle. Peter turns and glares at them. \u201cHey\nbaby, you come back here, sit with me and I\u2019ll let you work this pick.\u201d They\nall laugh as he motions to his groin. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Peter\nalmost comes out of his seat, fuming. I simply roll my eyes. \u201cSorry man, I\ndon\u2019t they\u2019ve invented enough equipment to find your,\u201d I motion to my groin,\n\u201ctry someone with microscopes for eyes.\u201d The guys friends lose it, yelling out\n\u201cOH BURN!\u201d \u201cMAN, SHE JUST FLAMED YOU!\u201d among other things. I look down at\nPeter, who is grinning ear to ear, mouth slightly agape. They guys in the back\nare still yelling when I turn my attention back to the teacher. \u201cI\u2019m Elizabeth\nWorkapick. But I go by middle name, Raine. I just moved hear from Tennessee.\u201d I\nsay, and she nods, trying not to smile at me. She marks me present, tells the\nboys to settle down and then begins teaching.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Soon\nenough I\u2019m sitting in my last class of the day, junior English. The rest of the\nclass is preparing their final drafts on \u2018<i>Of\nMice and Men\u2019</i>. I sit in the corner, watching Ned and Peter type their\nessays, as I\u2019ve been exempt since they\u2019re almost done. </p><p>The final bell rings, signaling the end of the day, and I\npick my backpack up, shouldering it. We meet up with MJ.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHey\nguys.\u201d She greets us. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHey MJ.\u201d\nI say, shuffling through my bag to put my schedule in there. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHey\nRaine, do you wanna come and play Mario Cart with us at my house? We usually\nstudy after words, if Pete doesn\u2019t ditch us.\u201d Ned asks, taking a drink from his\nwater bottle. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI wish I\ncould but one; I\u2019ve never played Mario Cart, and two; I have to go to football\npractice.\u201d I make a face, while everyone stares at me. They continue staring so\nI start to wipe my face. \u201cWhat? Do I have something on my face?\u201d I ask, looking\nat them. But now they\u2019re paying no attention to me, glancing at each other. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhat do\nyou mean you have football practice? Like you\u2019re going go watch football\npractice?\u201d MJ asks, cocking her head to the side.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cNo, I,\nI\u2019m like a football nurse. It\u2019s called football training. I go to practice and\ngames. I\u2019m medical team if they get hurt. And a water girl when they need it.\u201d\nI explain, but they still look confused. \u201cOkay, if you all want to see what I\ndo you\u2019re welcome to come watch practice or a game sometime. But I gotta go, I\ndon\u2019t wanna be late on my first day.\u201d I say, waving and walking off from them.\nAs I turn away from them, they are still standing there, looking dumbstruck. </p><p>\u00a0</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0An hour\nlater I have three crates made with ice and water, two full sized coolers with\nice and water, and one mini with just ice. I load all of that, and the training\nbag, AED, and helmet bag into the golf cart. I get the keys from Sydney, and\ndrive onto the field. I\u2019ve changed out of my school clothes and into some\nathletic shorts, and old shirt, a hat with my hair pulled into a ponytail, and\ntennis shoes. I pull onto the field and start unloading, starting with the big\ncoolers. I flex my muscles a bit as I unload them, setting the first one on the\ntable. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHere let\nme help you with that!\u201d I hear a male voice say from behind me. I turn to see a\nboy wearing the number 28 jogging towards me, his helmet in his hands. \u201cYou\nnew?\u201d He asks, and I nod as he unloads the second big cooler.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYeah I\ntransferred in this morning. I\u2019m a student athletic trainer.\u201d He nods, reaching\nfor the smaller cooler. I watch his bicep ripple, and before I can warn him\nit\u2019s not as heavy, he uses his full strength to lift it and socks himself in\nthe eye, cooler and all. The cooler crashes to the ground as he grabs his eye. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cSon of a\nbitch!\u201d He yells, clutching his left eye. Immediately I go to his side, putting\nmy one of my hands over his, the other on his back. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHey let\nme see. C\u2019mon quit hopping around like that and let me look.\u201d I say, he stops\nhopping around, but is still clutching his eye. His right pierces me.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cA warning\nwould\u2019ve been nice man.\u201d I chuckle, tapping his hands still covering his eye.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIf you\nhadn\u2019t been flexing and showing off you wouldn\u2019t have needed a warning. C\u2019mon.\u201d\nHe moves his hands, sitting his butt on the table so my 5\u20191 frame can get a\ngood look at his eye. It\u2019s red, swelling, and watering. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He smirks\nat me. \u201cSo, you noticed I was flexing? Did you like the view?\u201d He wiggles his\neyebrows at me, and I laugh again.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOh, you\nthink you\u2019re smooth. You probably orchestrated all of that so you could stare\ninto my eyes.\u201d I say, turning to pick the ice cooler back up. About half of its\nleft, the other half strewn across the turf and track. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou\u2019ve\ngot me figured out short stop. But I\u2019m not hearing a no about the view.\u201d I\nsmirk, trying not to smile. I grab a bag and toss some ice in before sucking\nthe air out. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHere, put\nthis on your eye. It\u2019s gonna to be black. You\u2019ve got one hell of an arm. Let me\nguess, quarter back?\u201d I guess, handing him the ice pack. He obediently places\nit on his left eye.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cMost\npeople call me Jacob Sanderson, but you\u2019re not wrong. I am in fact the\nfirst-string quarter back.\u201d I nod, picking the cooler up and setting it on the\ntable. The coaches whistle, and he attempts to wink at me although with his\nleft eye still closed all him manages is a very predominate blink in my\ndirection. \u201cDamn. Forget I did that, remember the awesome flexing muscles, okay\nshort stop? I\u2019ll be seeing ya.\u201d I laugh again, giving him a thumbs up as he\njogs away. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cRaine!\u201d I\nhear someone yell behind me, and see Peter, MJ, and Ned in the bleachers. I\nwave at them, looking to make sure no ones running on the track before I jog\nacross it and climb up to where they are. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHey guys,\nwhat\u2019s up?\u201d I ask, stealing a chip out of MJ\u2019s bag. I crunch on it happily. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWe\ndecided that you taking care of dumbass football players is more interesting\nthan Mario Cart.\u201d Ned announces, taking a bite out of his sandwich. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhat did\nSanderson want? He try to immediately get in your pants?\u201d MJ asks, shaking her\nhead. \u201cHe\u2019s so predictable. He sees pretty girl; he sleeps with pretty girl. Or\nat least attempts to.\u201d The way she says it, I wonder how many times she had to\nturn him down. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOh, they\naren\u2019t that bad. Not most of them. It\u2019s just when they see any pair of boobs\nwalking around, they have to flirt. It\u2019s like they can\u2019t help it. Doesn\u2019t\nmatter is she\u2019s ugly or not. There only half-hearted attempts anyways.\u201d I say,\nleaning on the railing. I hear another whistle blow, \u201cHey guys I gotta go, you\ndon\u2019t have to stay. It\u2019s mostly boring. Bye!\u201d I yell, then stop and turn\naround. \u201cOh, do you all want my number?\u201d Pete stops, Ned nods enthusiastically,\nand MJ hands me her phone. I put my number in and then descend the steps, going\nback to practice.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><b>Next\nPart: COMING SOON!</b></p>",

After I had finished, I grabbed\nmy backpack, and left. I had practiced driving to Midtown three times since I\nhad left the football field, but I still put it in my GPS just in case. There\nwas more traffic in the morning, which I had planned for. I arrived about two\nhours before school officially started, which was my plan. I enter the school\nbuilding at 6:15. I head for the front office and tell the lady I\u2019m a new\nstudent. In forty-five minutes, I\u2019m walking back out with a fresh, official\nschedule. I still have over an hour before school starts, so I ask for\ndirections to the training room. The lady tells me, and I thank her before\ntrudging my way towards the other end of the school. I find what I\u2019m looking\nfor, the name \u2018<i>Sydney Baker, AT\u2019</i>\nprinted on the door tells me I\u2019ve found the right place. I knock before placing\nmy hand on the door handle.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cCome in!\u201d\nI hear, and I push open the door to see the biggest training room I\u2019ve ever\nbeen in. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWoah.\u201d I\nsay, looking around. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A tall\nwoman approaches me, with a I-need-more-coffee face on. \u201cCan I help you?\u201d She\nasks, eyeing me. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHi yes,\nmy name is Raine, I just transferred in this morning and I-\u201c</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She turns,\npulling a paper packet off her desk. \u201cFill these out and have a doctor fill\nthem and sign off and then we can get you playing. What sports do you play?\u201d\nShe asks, sitting down at her desk and booting up her computer.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOh no,\nyou misunderstand. I\u2019m here to see if you need any football trainers,\u201d I\nshuffle around in my bag until I find the paper I\u2019m looking for, \u201cthis is a\nletter of recommendation from my former head trainer in Tennessee.\u201d She takes\nthe paper from me, reading silently. I look around as she reads, taking in all\ntheir equipment. It all looks state of the art, brand-new. I\u2019m focusing in on\ntheir ice machine when she clears her throat.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou come\nvery highly recommended.\u201d She states, looking over the letter once again. \u201cIf\nyou\u2019re as good as they say you are then you can come work for me. We don\u2019t get\na lot of kids who come to train so it\u2019d just be me and you.\u201d I nod, grinning.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThank you\nso much.

Well they\nweren\u2019t wrong about you being pretty. I\u2019m MJ.\u201d I take her hand as the boys both\nprotest.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHey!\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWe did not talk about her all\nweekend!\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I laugh at them both while MJ\nsmiles. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOh yeah, you all didn\u2019t tell me\nabout her milk chocolate eyes, perfect teeth, and perfectly curly hair? Did I\ndream you all telling me that stuff? Because it all seems to be true.\u201d Her\neyebrows raise, and I laugh some more.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cMJ!\u201d Peter groans, and Ned\nnervously chuckles.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHey, I\u2019m more than okay to hear\nabout her over Liiiiiz, Parker.\u201d MJ teases.

He\u2019s had a crush\non her since freshman year, but she\u2019s popular, a senior, and doesn\u2019t know that\nPeter even exists. So, him and Ned stalk her every chance they get.\u201d MJ dishes,\nmuch to Peter\u2019s horror.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOoo well then I feel special if I\nmade such an impression on you two if I trumped Liz.\u201d I say, grinning, Peter\nsmiles at me. MJ asks for my schedule and I hand it over to her, we all start\nwalking in what I guess is the direction of my class. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI have second period general\nphysics with you. These two both have advanced physics.\u201d She says jerking her\nfinger towards the boys who have fallen in step behind us. They\u2019re whispering\nto each other but nod when she mentions them. She stops walking, and we all\ncome to a grinding halt. \u201cThis is your class room Raine, Algebra II with\nLackluster. I\u2019ll pick you up after and take you to physics.\u201d I nod but the boys\nboth start to kick up a storm. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHey, I can come get her no\nproblem!\u201d Ned says, while Peter nods.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou two both have class on the\nother side of the school. And I have our next class with her, so it makes\nsense. You two can drool over her later.\u201d MJ replies, and the boys complain\nagain.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThanks guys, but I really don\u2019t\nneed y\u2019all to make an extra trip just for me. I\u2019ll be fine with MJ.\u201d They both\nlook disappointed but agree. We all say our goodbyes as the bell rings. I duck\ninto the class and quickly scan the room. There seems to be two seats left, one\nin the front where a bunch of the stoners seem to be, and one near the middle\nwhere a bunch of popular kids seem to be sitting. I take my chances on the\npopular kids, taking my seat.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0By the\ntime my last three classes roll around I\u2019m already tired. But as soon as I see\nPeter I perk back up. I see him waiting near the door for my last class,\npresumably to pick me up. But his eyes seemed trained on something out of my\nrange of vision. I walk towards him looking in the direction he is. I get\nnearer to him when I see a pretty girl around the corner. She is pulling books\nout of her locker the front of the locker has magnetic letters that spell \u2018Liz\u2019\nout on the front. And suddenly, what he\u2019s staring at makes sense. I sneak up by\nhim, whispering \u201cWhatcha looking at Peter?\u201d In his ear, scaring him. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOh! Huh?\nI wasn\u2019t staring at her-anything! I wasn\u2019t staring at anything!\u201d He says, all\njumpy. A soft smile plays on my lips. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cShe\nreally is pretty. Do you talk to her? Like have you tried?\u201d I ask, falling in\nstep with him. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOh no. I\nthink she likes Flash, they\u2019re together a lot.\u201d He says, shrugging. \u201cBesides MJ\nwas over playing it. I didn\u2019t have a huge crush on her.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cDid?\nThat\u2019s past tense Pete.\u201d He shrugs, his fingers looped through his backpack\nstraps. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cShe\u2019s\npretty, but you know as time goes on, I realize being pretty doesn\u2019t add up to\neverything. Personality is a lot of it. We\u2019re here.\u201d He says, opening the door\nfor me.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I nod,\nfollowing him to his seat. \u201cHere, the seat beside me is free. Ned was\noriginally in here, but he dropped it to take Comp Shop.\u201d Peter pats the seat\nnext to him. I put my backpack on the floor and take my seat. Soon the teacher\nenters, and my mouth hangs open. I was expecting and older lady, but the woman\nin front of me can\u2019t possibly be thirty yet, but she is strikingly beautiful. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cPeter how\ndo you not pay attention to <i>that</i>?\u201d I\nask, dumb founded. She flicks her blonde hair over her shoulder writing \u2018<i>Mesopotamia</i>\u2019 on the board. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The boy\nshrugs his shoulders. \u201cI guess she\u2019s not my type. Besides, every boy in here\ndegrades her and the <i>things</i> they say\nabout her, it\u2019s sick.\u201d I smile at him softly. Almost as if to make his point,\nshe drops her marker. She hasn\u2019t even bent over to pick it up and the boys in\nthe back whoop and holler at the prospect of her having to bend over. She casts\nan icy gaze on the boys with her blue green eyes, kicks the marker under her\ndesk and then pulls a new one out of her desk. I grin at her antics, knowing\nfull well that she\u2019s doing it on purpose. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The bell\nrings, and she begins to take attendance. She gets towards the bottom of her\nattendance sheet when she pauses. \u201cElizabeth Workapick?\u201d She calls out scanning\nthe room. The boys in the back all make a fuss over my name. Believe me I\u2019ve\nheard every play on the name Workapick. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I stand\nup, and one of the boys let out a whistle. Peter turns and glares at them. \u201cHey\nbaby, you come back here, sit with me and I\u2019ll let you work this pick.\u201d They\nall laugh as he motions to his groin. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Peter\nalmost comes out of his seat, fuming. I simply roll my eyes. \u201cSorry man, I\ndon\u2019t they\u2019ve invented enough equipment to find your,\u201d I motion to my groin,\n\u201ctry someone with microscopes for eyes.\u201d The guys friends lose it, yelling out\n\u201cOH BURN!\u201d \u201cMAN, SHE JUST FLAMED YOU!\u201d among other things. I look down at\nPeter, who is grinning ear to ear, mouth slightly agape. They guys in the back\nare still yelling when I turn my attention back to the teacher. \u201cI\u2019m Elizabeth\nWorkapick. But I go by middle name, Raine. I just moved hear from Tennessee.\u201d I\nsay, and she nods, trying not to smile at me. She marks me present, tells the\nboys to settle down and then begins teaching.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Soon\nenough I\u2019m sitting in my last class of the day, junior English. The rest of the\nclass is preparing their final drafts on \u2018<i>Of\nMice and Men\u2019</i>. I sit in the corner, watching Ned and Peter type their\nessays, as I\u2019ve been exempt since they\u2019re almost done. </p><p>The final bell rings, signaling the end of the day, and I\npick my backpack up, shouldering it. We meet up with MJ.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHey\nguys.\u201d She greets us. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHey MJ.\u201d\nI say, shuffling through my bag to put my schedule in there. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHey\nRaine, do you wanna come and play Mario Cart with us at my house? We usually\nstudy after words, if Pete doesn\u2019t ditch us.\u201d Ned asks, taking a drink from his\nwater bottle. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI wish I\ncould but one; I\u2019ve never played Mario Cart, and two; I have to go to football\npractice.\u201d I make a face, while everyone stares at me. They continue staring so\nI start to wipe my face. \u201cWhat? Do I have something on my face?\u201d I ask, looking\nat them. But now they\u2019re paying no attention to me, glancing at each other. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhat do\nyou mean you have football practice? Like you\u2019re going go watch football\npractice?\u201d MJ asks, cocking her head to the side.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cNo, I,\nI\u2019m like a football nurse. It\u2019s called football training. I go to practice and\ngames. I\u2019m medical team if they get hurt. And a water girl when they need it.\u201d\nI explain, but they still look confused. \u201cOkay, if you all want to see what I\ndo you\u2019re welcome to come watch practice or a game sometime. But I gotta go, I\ndon\u2019t wanna be late on my first day.\u201d I say, waving and walking off from them.\nAs I turn away from them, they are still standing there, looking dumbstruck. </p><p>\u00a0</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0An hour\nlater I have three crates made with ice and water, two full sized coolers with\nice and water, and one mini with just ice. I load all of that, and the training\nbag, AED, and helmet bag into the golf cart. I get the keys from Sydney, and\ndrive onto the field. I\u2019ve changed out of my school clothes and into some\nathletic shorts, and old shirt, a hat with my hair pulled into a ponytail, and\ntennis shoes. I pull onto the field and start unloading, starting with the big\ncoolers. I flex my muscles a bit as I unload them, setting the first one on the\ntable. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHere let\nme help you with that!\u201d I hear a male voice say from behind me. I turn to see a\nboy wearing the number 28 jogging towards me, his helmet in his hands. \u201cYou\nnew?\u201d He asks, and I nod as he unloads the second big cooler.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYeah I\ntransferred in this morning. I\u2019m a student athletic trainer.\u201d He nods, reaching\nfor the smaller cooler. I watch his bicep ripple, and before I can warn him\nit\u2019s not as heavy, he uses his full strength to lift it and socks himself in\nthe eye, cooler and all. The cooler crashes to the ground as he grabs his eye. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cSon of a\nbitch!\u201d He yells, clutching his left eye. Immediately I go to his side, putting\nmy one of my hands over his, the other on his back. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHey let\nme see. C\u2019mon quit hopping around like that and let me look.\u201d I say, he stops\nhopping around, but is still clutching his eye. His right pierces me.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cA warning\nwould\u2019ve been nice man.\u201d I chuckle, tapping his hands still covering his eye.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIf you\nhadn\u2019t been flexing and showing off you wouldn\u2019t have needed a warning. C\u2019mon.\u201d\nHe moves his hands, sitting his butt on the table so my 5\u20191 frame can get a\ngood look at his eye. It\u2019s red, swelling, and watering. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He smirks\nat me. \u201cSo, you noticed I was flexing? Did you like the view?\u201d He wiggles his\neyebrows at me, and I laugh again.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOh, you\nthink you\u2019re smooth. You probably orchestrated all of that so you could stare\ninto my eyes.\u201d I say, turning to pick the ice cooler back up. About half of its\nleft, the other half strewn across the turf and track. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou\u2019ve\ngot me figured out short stop. But I\u2019m not hearing a no about the view.\u201d I\nsmirk, trying not to smile. I grab a bag and toss some ice in before sucking\nthe air out. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHere, put\nthis on your eye. It\u2019s gonna to be black. You\u2019ve got one hell of an arm. Let me\nguess, quarter back?\u201d I guess, handing him the ice pack. He obediently places\nit on his left eye.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cMost\npeople call me Jacob Sanderson, but you\u2019re not wrong. I am in fact the\nfirst-string quarter back.\u201d I nod, picking the cooler up and setting it on the\ntable. The coaches whistle, and he attempts to wink at me although with his\nleft eye still closed all him manages is a very predominate blink in my\ndirection. \u201cDamn. Forget I did that, remember the awesome flexing muscles, okay\nshort stop? I\u2019ll be seeing ya.\u201d I laugh again, giving him a thumbs up as he\njogs away. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cRaine!\u201d I\nhear someone yell behind me, and see Peter, MJ, and Ned in the bleachers. I\nwave at them, looking to make sure no ones running on the track before I jog\nacross it and climb up to where they are. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHey guys,\nwhat\u2019s up?\u201d I ask, stealing a chip out of MJ\u2019s bag. I crunch on it happily. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWe\ndecided that you taking care of dumbass football players is more interesting\nthan Mario Cart.\u201d Ned announces, taking a bite out of his sandwich. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhat did\nSanderson want? He try to immediately get in your pants?\u201d MJ asks, shaking her\nhead. \u201cHe\u2019s so predictable. He sees pretty girl; he sleeps with pretty girl. Or\nat least attempts to.\u201d The way she says it, I wonder how many times she had to\nturn him down. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOh, they\naren\u2019t that bad. Not most of them. It\u2019s just when they see any pair of boobs\nwalking around, they have to flirt. It\u2019s like they can\u2019t help it. Doesn\u2019t\nmatter is she\u2019s ugly or not. There only half-hearted attempts anyways.\u201d I say,\nleaning on the railing. I hear another whistle blow, \u201cHey guys I gotta go, you\ndon\u2019t have to stay. It\u2019s mostly boring. Bye!\u201d I yell, then stop and turn\naround. \u201cOh, do you all want my number?\u201d Pete stops, Ned nods enthusiastically,\nand MJ hands me her phone. I put my number in and then descend the steps, going\nback to practice.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><b>Next\nPart: COMING SOON!</b></p>",

After I had finished, I grabbed\nmy backpack, and left. I had practiced driving to Midtown three times since I\nhad left the football field, but I still put it in my GPS just in case. There\nwas more traffic in the morning, which I had planned for. I arrived about two\nhours before school officially started, which was my plan. I enter the school\nbuilding at 6:15. I head for the front office and tell the lady I\u2019m a new\nstudent. In forty-five minutes, I\u2019m walking back out with a fresh, official\nschedule. I still have over an hour before school starts, so I ask for\ndirections to the training room. The lady tells me, and I thank her before\ntrudging my way towards the other end of the school. I find what I\u2019m looking\nfor, the name \u2018<i>Sydney Baker, AT\u2019</i>\nprinted on the door tells me I\u2019ve found the right place. I knock before placing\nmy hand on the door handle.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cCome in!\u201d\nI hear, and I push open the door to see the biggest training room I\u2019ve ever\nbeen in. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWoah.\u201d I\nsay, looking around. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A tall\nwoman approaches me, with a I-need-more-coffee face on. \u201cCan I help you?\u201d She\nasks, eyeing me. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHi yes,\nmy name is Raine, I just transferred in this morning and I-\u201c</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She turns,\npulling a paper packet off her desk. \u201cFill these out and have a doctor fill\nthem and sign off and then we can get you playing.

I\u2019m here to see if you need any football trainers,\u201d I\nshuffle around in my bag until I find the paper I\u2019m looking for, \u201cthis is a\nletter of recommendation from my former head trainer in Tennessee.\u201d She takes\nthe paper from me, reading silently. I look around as she reads, taking in all\ntheir equipment. It all looks state of the art, brand-new. I\u2019m focusing in on\ntheir ice machine when she clears her throat.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou come\nvery highly recommended.\u201d She states, looking over the letter once again. \u201cIf\nyou\u2019re as good as they say you are then you can come work for me. We don\u2019t get\na lot of kids who come to train so it\u2019d just be me and you.\u201d I nod, grinning.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThank you\nso much. I love training, it\u2019s my entire life to be honest.\u201d I say, shifting\nthe weight of my backpack. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThe only\nrequirements are that you have good grades, come to practice twice a week, and\nof course all games, here and away.\u201d I nod, expecting no less. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI\u2019ll be\nhere. Do you need me today?\u201d I ask, eager to get my hands on all the new\nequipment I\u2019m spying. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIf you\nwant. Practice starts as soon as the school day is over.\u201d I nod and shake her\nhand. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI\u2019ll be\nhere.\u201d I say, turning to leave.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I get to\nthe front entrance with ten minutes to spare. I see Ned and Peter standing with\na tall girl. Ned sees me first, waving. <a>\u201cHey!\u201d He yells,\ncausing Peter and the girl to turn and wave at me too. </a></p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHey!\u201d I say, jogging to close the\ndistance between all of us. \u201cSorry I\u2019m late. I had somethings to do before\nschool started.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s cool. MJ, this is Raine.\nRaine, MJ.\u201d Ned says, nodding towards the girl. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She sticks her hand out. \u201cSo, you\u2019re\nthe pretty truck girl these guys couldn\u2019t shut up about all weekend. Well they\nweren\u2019t wrong about you being pretty. I\u2019m MJ.\u201d I take her hand as the boys both\nprotest.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHey!\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWe did not talk about her all\nweekend!\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I laugh at them both while MJ\nsmiles. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOh yeah, you all didn\u2019t tell me\nabout her milk chocolate eyes, perfect teeth, and perfectly curly hair? Did I\ndream you all telling me that stuff? Because it all seems to be true.\u201d Her\neyebrows raise, and I laugh some more.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cMJ!\u201d Peter groans, and Ned\nnervously chuckles.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHey, I\u2019m more than okay to hear\nabout her over Liiiiiz, Parker.\u201d MJ teases. This time Ned laughs.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWait who\u2019s Liz?\u201d I ask, looking\nbetween them all.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cNo one!\u201d Peter quickly quips up,\nturning red. \u201cWill you please not say that so loud?\u201d He asks, looking over his\nshoulders.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cLiz,\u201d Peter makes shushing noise\ntowards MJ, but she continues, \u201cis the love of Peter\u2019s life. He\u2019s had a crush\non her since freshman year, but she\u2019s popular, a senior, and doesn\u2019t know that\nPeter even exists. So, him and Ned stalk her every chance they get.\u201d MJ dishes,\nmuch to Peter\u2019s horror.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOoo well then I feel special if I\nmade such an impression on you two if I trumped Liz.\u201d I say, grinning, Peter\nsmiles at me. MJ asks for my schedule and I hand it over to her, we all start\nwalking in what I guess is the direction of my class. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI have second period general\nphysics with you. These two both have advanced physics.\u201d She says jerking her\nfinger towards the boys who have fallen in step behind us. They\u2019re whispering\nto each other but nod when she mentions them. She stops walking, and we all\ncome to a grinding halt. \u201cThis is your class room Raine, Algebra II with\nLackluster. I\u2019ll pick you up after and take you to physics.\u201d I nod but the boys\nboth start to kick up a storm. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHey, I can come get her no\nproblem!\u201d Ned says, while Peter nods.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou two both have class on the\nother side of the school. And I have our next class with her, so it makes\nsense. You two can drool over her later.\u201d MJ replies, and the boys complain\nagain.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThanks guys, but I really don\u2019t\nneed y\u2019all to make an extra trip just for me. I\u2019ll be fine with MJ.\u201d They both\nlook disappointed but agree. We all say our goodbyes as the bell rings. I duck\ninto the class and quickly scan the room. There seems to be two seats left, one\nin the front where a bunch of the stoners seem to be, and one near the middle\nwhere a bunch of popular kids seem to be sitting. I take my chances on the\npopular kids, taking my seat.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0By the\ntime my last three classes roll around I\u2019m already tired. But as soon as I see\nPeter I perk back up. I see him waiting near the door for my last class,\npresumably to pick me up. But his eyes seemed trained on something out of my\nrange of vision. I walk towards him looking in the direction he is. I get\nnearer to him when I see a pretty girl around the corner. She is pulling books\nout of her locker the front of the locker has magnetic letters that spell \u2018Liz\u2019\nout on the front. And suddenly, what he\u2019s staring at makes sense. I sneak up by\nhim, whispering \u201cWhatcha looking at Peter?\u201d In his ear, scaring him. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOh! Huh?\nI wasn\u2019t staring at her-anything! I wasn\u2019t staring at anything!\u201d He says, all\njumpy. A soft smile plays on my lips. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cShe\nreally is pretty. Do you talk to her? Like have you tried?\u201d I ask, falling in\nstep with him. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOh no. I\nthink she likes Flash, they\u2019re together a lot.\u201d He says, shrugging. \u201cBesides MJ\nwas over playing it. I didn\u2019t have a huge crush on her.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cDid?\nThat\u2019s past tense Pete.\u201d He shrugs, his fingers looped through his backpack\nstraps. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cShe\u2019s\npretty, but you know as time goes on, I realize being pretty doesn\u2019t add up to\neverything. Personality is a lot of it. We\u2019re here.\u201d He says, opening the door\nfor me.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I nod,\nfollowing him to his seat. \u201cHere, the seat beside me is free. Ned was\noriginally in here, but he dropped it to take Comp Shop.\u201d Peter pats the seat\nnext to him. I put my backpack on the floor and take my seat. Soon the teacher\nenters, and my mouth hangs open. I was expecting and older lady, but the woman\nin front of me can\u2019t possibly be thirty yet, but she is strikingly beautiful. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cPeter how\ndo you not pay attention to <i>that</i>?\u201d I\nask, dumb founded. She flicks her blonde hair over her shoulder writing \u2018<i>Mesopotamia</i>\u2019 on the board. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The boy\nshrugs his shoulders. \u201cI guess she\u2019s not my type. Besides, every boy in here\ndegrades her and the <i>things</i> they say\nabout her, it\u2019s sick.\u201d I smile at him softly. Almost as if to make his point,\nshe drops her marker. She hasn\u2019t even bent over to pick it up and the boys in\nthe back whoop and holler at the prospect of her having to bend over. She casts\nan icy gaze on the boys with her blue green eyes, kicks the marker under her\ndesk and then pulls a new one out of her desk. I grin at her antics, knowing\nfull well that she\u2019s doing it on purpose. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The bell\nrings, and she begins to take attendance. She gets towards the bottom of her\nattendance sheet when she pauses. \u201cElizabeth Workapick?\u201d She calls out scanning\nthe room. The boys in the back all make a fuss over my name. Believe me I\u2019ve\nheard every play on the name Workapick. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I stand\nup, and one of the boys let out a whistle. Peter turns and glares at them. \u201cHey\nbaby, you come back here, sit with me and I\u2019ll let you work this pick.\u201d They\nall laugh as he motions to his groin. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Peter\nalmost comes out of his seat, fuming. I simply roll my eyes. \u201cSorry man, I\ndon\u2019t they\u2019ve invented enough equipment to find your,\u201d I motion to my groin,\n\u201ctry someone with microscopes for eyes.\u201d The guys friends lose it, yelling out\n\u201cOH BURN!\u201d \u201cMAN, SHE JUST FLAMED YOU!\u201d among other things. I look down at\nPeter, who is grinning ear to ear, mouth slightly agape. They guys in the back\nare still yelling when I turn my attention back to the teacher. \u201cI\u2019m Elizabeth\nWorkapick. But I go by middle name, Raine. I just moved hear from Tennessee.\u201d I\nsay, and she nods, trying not to smile at me. She marks me present, tells the\nboys to settle down and then begins teaching.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Soon\nenough I\u2019m sitting in my last class of the day, junior English. The rest of the\nclass is preparing their final drafts on \u2018<i>Of\nMice and Men\u2019</i>. I sit in the corner, watching Ned and Peter type their\nessays, as I\u2019ve been exempt since they\u2019re almost done. </p><p>The final bell rings, signaling the end of the day, and I\npick my backpack up, shouldering it. We meet up with MJ.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHey\nguys.\u201d She greets us. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHey MJ.\u201d\nI say, shuffling through my bag to put my schedule in there. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHey\nRaine, do you wanna come and play Mario Cart with us at my house? We usually\nstudy after words, if Pete doesn\u2019t ditch us.\u201d Ned asks, taking a drink from his\nwater bottle. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI wish I\ncould but one; I\u2019ve never played Mario Cart, and two; I have to go to football\npractice.\u201d I make a face, while everyone stares at me. They continue staring so\nI start to wipe my face. \u201cWhat? Do I have something on my face?\u201d I ask, looking\nat them. But now they\u2019re paying no attention to me, glancing at each other. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhat do\nyou mean you have football practice? Like you\u2019re going go watch football\npractice?\u201d MJ asks, cocking her head to the side.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cNo, I,\nI\u2019m like a football nurse. It\u2019s called football training. I go to practice and\ngames. I\u2019m medical team if they get hurt. And a water girl when they need it.\u201d\nI explain, but they still look confused. \u201cOkay, if you all want to see what I\ndo you\u2019re welcome to come watch practice or a game sometime. But I gotta go, I\ndon\u2019t wanna be late on my first day.\u201d I say, waving and walking off from them.\nAs I turn away from them, they are still standing there, looking dumbstruck. </p><p>\u00a0</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0An hour\nlater I have three crates made with ice and water, two full sized coolers with\nice and water, and one mini with just ice. I load all of that, and the training\nbag, AED, and helmet bag into the golf cart. I get the keys from Sydney, and\ndrive onto the field. I\u2019ve changed out of my school clothes and into some\nathletic shorts, and old shirt, a hat with my hair pulled into a ponytail, and\ntennis shoes. I pull onto the field and start unloading, starting with the big\ncoolers. I flex my muscles a bit as I unload them, setting the first one on the\ntable. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHere let\nme help you with that!\u201d I hear a male voice say from behind me. I turn to see a\nboy wearing the number 28 jogging towards me, his helmet in his hands. \u201cYou\nnew?\u201d He asks, and I nod as he unloads the second big cooler.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYeah I\ntransferred in this morning. I\u2019m a student athletic trainer.\u201d He nods, reaching\nfor the smaller cooler. I watch his bicep ripple, and before I can warn him\nit\u2019s not as heavy, he uses his full strength to lift it and socks himself in\nthe eye, cooler and all. The cooler crashes to the ground as he grabs his eye. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cSon of a\nbitch!\u201d He yells, clutching his left eye. Immediately I go to his side, putting\nmy one of my hands over his, the other on his back. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHey let\nme see. C\u2019mon quit hopping around like that and let me look.\u201d I say, he stops\nhopping around, but is still clutching his eye. His right pierces me.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cA warning\nwould\u2019ve been nice man.\u201d I chuckle, tapping his hands still covering his eye.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIf you\nhadn\u2019t been flexing and showing off you wouldn\u2019t have needed a warning. C\u2019mon.\u201d\nHe moves his hands, sitting his butt on the table so my 5\u20191 frame can get a\ngood look at his eye. It\u2019s red, swelling, and watering. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He smirks\nat me. \u201cSo, you noticed I was flexing? Did you like the view?\u201d He wiggles his\neyebrows at me, and I laugh again.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOh, you\nthink you\u2019re smooth. You probably orchestrated all of that so you could stare\ninto my eyes.\u201d I say, turning to pick the ice cooler back up. About half of its\nleft, the other half strewn across the turf and track. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou\u2019ve\ngot me figured out short stop. But I\u2019m not hearing a no about the view.\u201d I\nsmirk, trying not to smile. I grab a bag and toss some ice in before sucking\nthe air out. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHere, put\nthis on your eye. It\u2019s gonna to be black. You\u2019ve got one hell of an arm. Let me\nguess, quarter back?\u201d I guess, handing him the ice pack. He obediently places\nit on his left eye.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cMost\npeople call me Jacob Sanderson, but you\u2019re not wrong. I am in fact the\nfirst-string quarter back.\u201d I nod, picking the cooler up and setting it on the\ntable. The coaches whistle, and he attempts to wink at me although with his\nleft eye still closed all him manages is a very predominate blink in my\ndirection. \u201cDamn. Forget I did that, remember the awesome flexing muscles, okay\nshort stop? I\u2019ll be seeing ya.\u201d I laugh again, giving him a thumbs up as he\njogs away. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cRaine!\u201d I\nhear someone yell behind me, and see Peter, MJ, and Ned in the bleachers. I\nwave at them, looking to make sure no ones running on the track before I jog\nacross it and climb up to where they are. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHey guys,\nwhat\u2019s up?\u201d I ask, stealing a chip out of MJ\u2019s bag. I crunch on it happily. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWe\ndecided that you taking care of dumbass football players is more interesting\nthan Mario Cart.\u201d Ned announces, taking a bite out of his sandwich. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhat did\nSanderson want? He try to immediately get in your pants?\u201d MJ asks, shaking her\nhead. \u201cHe\u2019s so predictable. He sees pretty girl; he sleeps with pretty girl. Or\nat least attempts to.\u201d The way she says it, I wonder how many times she had to\nturn him down. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOh, they\naren\u2019t that bad. Not most of them. It\u2019s just when they see any pair of boobs\nwalking around, they have to flirt. It\u2019s like they can\u2019t help it. Doesn\u2019t\nmatter is she\u2019s ugly or not. There only half-hearted attempts anyways.\u201d I say,\nleaning on the railing. I hear another whistle blow, \u201cHey guys I gotta go, you\ndon\u2019t have to stay. It\u2019s mostly boring.

After I had finished, I grabbed\nmy backpack, and left. I had practiced driving to Midtown three times since I\nhad left the football field, but I still put it in my GPS just in case. There\nwas more traffic in the morning, which I had planned for. I arrived about two\nhours before school officially started, which was my plan. I enter the school\nbuilding at 6:15. I head for the front office and tell the lady I&rsquo;m a new\nstudent. In forty-five minutes, I&rsquo;m walking back out with a fresh, official\nschedule. I still have over an hour before school starts, so I ask for\ndirections to the training room. The lady tells me, and I thank her before\ntrudging my way towards the other end of the school. I find what I&rsquo;m looking\nfor, the name &lsquo;<i>Sydney Baker, AT&rsquo;</i>\nprinted on the door tells me I&rsquo;ve found the right place. I knock before placing\nmy hand on the door handle.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Come in!&rdquo;\nI hear, and I push open the door to see the biggest training room I&rsquo;ve ever\nbeen in. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Woah.&rdquo; I\nsay, looking around. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A tall\nwoman approaches me, with a I-need-more-coffee face on. &ldquo;Can I help you?&rdquo; She\nasks, eyeing me. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Hi yes,\nmy name is Raine, I just transferred in this morning and I-&ldquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She turns,\npulling a paper packet off her desk. &ldquo;Fill these out and have a doctor fill\nthem and sign off and then we can get you playing. What sports do you play?&rdquo;\nShe asks, sitting down at her desk and booting up her computer.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Oh no,\nyou misunderstand. I&rsquo;m here to see if you need any football trainers,&rdquo; I\nshuffle around in my bag until I find the paper I&rsquo;m looking for, &ldquo;this is a\nletter of recommendation from my former head trainer in Tennessee.&rdquo; She takes\nthe paper from me, reading silently. I look around as she reads, taking in all\ntheir equipment. It all looks state of the art, brand-new. I&rsquo;m focusing in on\ntheir ice machine when she clears her throat.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;You come\nvery highly recommended.&rdquo; She states, looking over the letter once again. &ldquo;If\nyou&rsquo;re as good as they say you are then you can come work for me. We don&rsquo;t get\na lot of kids who come to train so it&rsquo;d just be me and you.&rdquo; I nod, grinning.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Thank you\nso much. I love training, it&rsquo;s my entire life to be honest.&rdquo; I say, shifting\nthe weight of my backpack. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;The only\nrequirements are that you have good grades, come to practice twice a week, and\nof course all games, here and away.&rdquo; I nod, expecting no less. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be\nhere. Do you need me today?&rdquo; I ask, eager to get my hands on all the new\nequipment I&rsquo;m spying. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;If you\nwant. Practice starts as soon as the school day is over.&rdquo; I nod and shake her\nhand. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be\nhere.&rdquo; I say, turning to leave.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I get to\nthe front entrance with ten minutes to spare. I see Ned and Peter standing with\na tall girl. Ned sees me first, waving. <a>&ldquo;Hey!&rdquo; He yells,\ncausing Peter and the girl to turn and wave at me too. </a></p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Hey!&rdquo; I say, jogging to close the\ndistance between all of us. &ldquo;Sorry I&rsquo;m late. I had somethings to do before\nschool started.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s cool. MJ, this is Raine.\nRaine, MJ.&rdquo; Ned says, nodding towards the girl. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She sticks her hand out. &ldquo;So, you&rsquo;re\nthe pretty truck girl these guys couldn&rsquo;t shut up about all weekend. Well they\nweren&rsquo;t wrong about you being pretty. I&rsquo;m MJ.&rdquo; I take her hand as the boys both\nprotest.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Hey!&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;We did not talk about her all\nweekend!&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I laugh at them both while MJ\nsmiles. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Oh yeah, you all didn&rsquo;t tell me\nabout her milk chocolate eyes, perfect teeth, and perfectly curly hair? Did I\ndream you all telling me that stuff? Because it all seems to be true.&rdquo; Her\neyebrows raise, and I laugh some more.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;MJ!&rdquo; Peter groans, and Ned\nnervously chuckles.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Hey, I&rsquo;m more than okay to hear\nabout her over Liiiiiz, Parker.&rdquo; MJ teases. This time Ned laughs.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Wait who&rsquo;s Liz?&rdquo; I ask, looking\nbetween them all.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;No one!&rdquo; Peter quickly quips up,\nturning red. &ldquo;Will you please not say that so loud?&rdquo; He asks, looking over his\nshoulders.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Liz,&rdquo; Peter makes shushing noise\ntowards MJ, but she continues, &ldquo;is the love of Peter&rsquo;s life. He&rsquo;s had a crush\non her since freshman year, but she&rsquo;s popular, a senior, and doesn&rsquo;t know that\nPeter even exists. So, him and Ned stalk her every chance they get.&rdquo; MJ dishes,\nmuch to Peter&rsquo;s horror.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Ooo well then I feel special if I\nmade such an impression on you two if I trumped Liz.&rdquo; I say, grinning, Peter\nsmiles at me. MJ asks for my schedule and I hand it over to her, we all start\nwalking in what I guess is the direction of my class. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;I have second period general\nphysics with you. These two both have advanced physics.&rdquo; She says jerking her\nfinger towards the boys who have fallen in step behind us. They&rsquo;re whispering\nto each other but nod when she mentions them. She stops walking, and we all\ncome to a grinding halt. &ldquo;This is your class room Raine, Algebra II with\nLackluster. I&rsquo;ll pick you up after and take you to physics.&rdquo; I nod but the boys\nboth start to kick up a storm. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Hey, I can come get her no\nproblem!&rdquo; Ned says, while Peter nods.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;You two both have class on the\nother side of the school. And I have our next class with her, so it makes\nsense. You two can drool over her later.&rdquo; MJ replies, and the boys complain\nagain.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Thanks guys, but I really don&rsquo;t\nneed y&rsquo;all to make an extra trip just for me. I&rsquo;ll be fine with MJ.&rdquo; They both\nlook disappointed but agree. We all say our goodbyes as the bell rings. I duck\ninto the class and quickly scan the room. There seems to be two seats left, one\nin the front where a bunch of the stoners seem to be, and one near the middle\nwhere a bunch of popular kids seem to be sitting. I take my chances on the\npopular kids, taking my seat.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;By the\ntime my last three classes roll around I&rsquo;m already tired. But as soon as I see\nPeter I perk back up. I see him waiting near the door for my last class,\npresumably to pick me up. But his eyes seemed trained on something out of my\nrange of vision. I walk towards him looking in the direction he is. I get\nnearer to him when I see a pretty girl around the corner. She is pulling books\nout of her locker the front of the locker has magnetic letters that spell &lsquo;Liz&rsquo;\nout on the front. And suddenly, what he&rsquo;s staring at makes sense. I sneak up by\nhim, whispering &ldquo;Whatcha looking at Peter?&rdquo; In his ear, scaring him. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Oh! Huh?\nI wasn&rsquo;t staring at her-anything! I wasn&rsquo;t staring at anything!&rdquo; He says, all\njumpy. A soft smile plays on my lips. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;She\nreally is pretty. Do you talk to her? Like have you tried?&rdquo; I ask, falling in\nstep with him. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Oh no. I\nthink she likes Flash, they&rsquo;re together a lot.&rdquo; He says, shrugging. &ldquo;Besides MJ\nwas over playing it. I didn&rsquo;t have a huge crush on her.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Did?\nThat&rsquo;s past tense Pete.&rdquo; He shrugs, his fingers looped through his backpack\nstraps. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;She&rsquo;s\npretty, but you know as time goes on, I realize being pretty doesn&rsquo;t add up to\neverything. Personality is a lot of it. We&rsquo;re here.&rdquo; He says, opening the door\nfor me.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I nod,\nfollowing him to his seat. &ldquo;Here, the seat beside me is free. Ned was\noriginally in here, but he dropped it to take Comp Shop.&rdquo; Peter pats the seat\nnext to him. I put my backpack on the floor and take my seat. Soon the teacher\nenters, and my mouth hangs open. I was expecting and older lady, but the woman\nin front of me can&rsquo;t possibly be thirty yet, but she is strikingly beautiful. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Peter how\ndo you not pay attention to <i>that</i>?&rdquo; I\nask, dumb founded. She flicks her blonde hair over her shoulder writing &lsquo;<i>Mesopotamia</i>&rsquo; on the board. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The boy\nshrugs his shoulders. &ldquo;I guess she&rsquo;s not my type. Besides, every boy in here\ndegrades her and the <i>things</i> they say\nabout her, it&rsquo;s sick.&rdquo; I smile at him softly. Almost as if to make his point,\nshe drops her marker. She hasn&rsquo;t even bent over to pick it up and the boys in\nthe back whoop and holler at the prospect of her having to bend over. She casts\nan icy gaze on the boys with her blue green eyes, kicks the marker under her\ndesk and then pulls a new one out of her desk. I grin at her antics, knowing\nfull well that she&rsquo;s doing it on purpose. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The bell\nrings, and she begins to take attendance. She gets towards the bottom of her\nattendance sheet when she pauses. &ldquo;Elizabeth Workapick?&rdquo; She calls out scanning\nthe room. The boys in the back all make a fuss over my name. Believe me I&rsquo;ve\nheard every play on the name Workapick. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I stand\nup, and one of the boys let out a whistle. Peter turns and glares at them. &ldquo;Hey\nbaby, you come back here, sit with me and I&rsquo;ll let you work this pick.&rdquo; They\nall laugh as he motions to his groin. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Peter\nalmost comes out of his seat, fuming. I simply roll my eyes. &ldquo;Sorry man, I\ndon&rsquo;t they&rsquo;ve invented enough equipment to find your,&rdquo; I motion to my groin,\n&ldquo;try someone with microscopes for eyes.&rdquo; The guys friends lose it, yelling out\n&ldquo;OH BURN!&rdquo; &ldquo;MAN, SHE JUST FLAMED YOU!&rdquo; among other things. I look down at\nPeter, who is grinning ear to ear, mouth slightly agape. They guys in the back\nare still yelling when I turn my attention back to the teacher. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Elizabeth\nWorkapick. But I go by middle name, Raine. I just moved hear from Tennessee.&rdquo; I\nsay, and she nods, trying not to smile at me. She marks me present, tells the\nboys to settle down and then begins teaching.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Soon\nenough I&rsquo;m sitting in my last class of the day, junior English. The rest of the\nclass is preparing their final drafts on &lsquo;<i>Of\nMice and Men&rsquo;</i>. I sit in the corner, watching Ned and Peter type their\nessays, as I&rsquo;ve been exempt since they&rsquo;re almost done. </p><p>The final bell rings, signaling the end of the day, and I\npick my backpack up, shouldering it. We meet up with MJ.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Hey\nguys.&rdquo; She greets us. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Hey MJ.&rdquo;\nI say, shuffling through my bag to put my schedule in there. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Hey\nRaine, do you wanna come and play Mario Cart with us at my house? We usually\nstudy after words, if Pete doesn&rsquo;t ditch us.&rdquo; Ned asks, taking a drink from his\nwater bottle. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;I wish I\ncould but one; I&rsquo;ve never played Mario Cart, and two; I have to go to football\npractice.&rdquo; I make a face, while everyone stares at me. They continue staring so\nI start to wipe my face. &ldquo;What? Do I have something on my face?&rdquo; I ask, looking\nat them. But now they&rsquo;re paying no attention to me, glancing at each other. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;What do\nyou mean you have football practice? Like you&rsquo;re going go watch football\npractice?&rdquo; MJ asks, cocking her head to the side.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;No, I,\nI&rsquo;m like a football nurse. It&rsquo;s called football training. I go to practice and\ngames. I&rsquo;m medical team if they get hurt. And a water girl when they need it.&rdquo;\nI explain, but they still look confused. &ldquo;Okay, if you all want to see what I\ndo you&rsquo;re welcome to come watch practice or a game sometime. But I gotta go, I\ndon&rsquo;t wanna be late on my first day.&rdquo; I say, waving and walking off from them.\nAs I turn away from them, they are still standing there, looking dumbstruck. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;An hour\nlater I have three crates made with ice and water, two full sized coolers with\nice and water, and one mini with just ice. I load all of that, and the training\nbag, AED, and helmet bag into the golf cart. I get the keys from Sydney, and\ndrive onto the field. I&rsquo;ve changed out of my school clothes and into some\nathletic shorts, and old shirt, a hat with my hair pulled into a ponytail, and\ntennis shoes. I pull onto the field and start unloading, starting with the big\ncoolers. I flex my muscles a bit as I unload them, setting the first one on the\ntable. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Here let\nme help you with that!&rdquo; I hear a male voice say from behind me. I turn to see a\nboy wearing the number 28 jogging towards me, his helmet in his hands. &ldquo;You\nnew?&rdquo; He asks, and I nod as he unloads the second big cooler.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Yeah I\ntransferred in this morning. I&rsquo;m a student athletic trainer.&rdquo; He nods, reaching\nfor the smaller cooler. I watch his bicep ripple, and before I can warn him\nit&rsquo;s not as heavy, he uses his full strength to lift it and socks himself in\nthe eye, cooler and all. The cooler crashes to the ground as he grabs his eye. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Son of a\nbitch!&rdquo; He yells, clutching his left eye. Immediately I go to his side, putting\nmy one of my hands over his, the other on his back. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Hey let\nme see. C&rsquo;mon quit hopping around like that and let me look.&rdquo; I say, he stops\nhopping around, but is still clutching his eye. His right pierces me.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;A warning\nwould&rsquo;ve been nice man.&rdquo; I chuckle, tapping his hands still covering his eye.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;If you\nhadn&rsquo;t been flexing and showing off you wouldn&rsquo;t have needed a warning. C&rsquo;mon.&rdquo;\nHe moves his hands, sitting his butt on the table so my 5&rsquo;1 frame can get a\ngood look at his eye. It&rsquo;s red, swelling, and watering. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He smirks\nat me. &ldquo;So, you noticed I was flexing? Did you like the view?&rdquo; He wiggles his\neyebrows at me, and I laugh again.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Oh, you\nthink you&rsquo;re smooth. You probably orchestrated all of that so you could stare\ninto my eyes.&rdquo; I say, turning to pick the ice cooler back up. About half of its\nleft, the other half strewn across the turf and track. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve\ngot me figured out short stop. But I&rsquo;m not hearing a no about the view.&rdquo; I\nsmirk, trying not to smile. I grab a bag and toss some ice in before sucking\nthe air out. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Here, put\nthis on your eye. It&rsquo;s gonna to be black. You&rsquo;ve got one hell of an arm. Let me\nguess, quarter back?&rdquo; I guess, handing him the ice pack. He obediently places\nit on his left eye.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Most\npeople call me Jacob Sanderson, but you&rsquo;re not wrong. I am in fact the\nfirst-string quarter back.&rdquo; I nod, picking the cooler up and setting it on the\ntable. The coaches whistle, and he attempts to wink at me although with his\nleft eye still closed all him manages is a very predominate blink in my\ndirection. &ldquo;Damn. Forget I did that, remember the awesome flexing muscles, okay\nshort stop? I&rsquo;ll be seeing ya.&rdquo; I laugh again, giving him a thumbs up as he\njogs away. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Raine!&rdquo; I\nhear someone yell behind me, and see Peter, MJ, and Ned in the bleachers. I\nwave at them, looking to make sure no ones running on the track before I jog\nacross it and climb up to where they are. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Hey guys,\nwhat&rsquo;s up?&rdquo; I ask, stealing a chip out of MJ&rsquo;s bag. I crunch on it happily. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;We\ndecided that you taking care of dumbass football players is more interesting\nthan Mario Cart.&rdquo; Ned announces, taking a bite out of his sandwich. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;What did\nSanderson want? He try to immediately get in your pants?&rdquo; MJ asks, shaking her\nhead. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s so predictable. He sees pretty girl; he sleeps with pretty girl. Or\nat least attempts to.&rdquo; The way she says it, I wonder how many times she had to\nturn him down. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Oh, they\naren&rsquo;t that bad. Not most of them. It&rsquo;s just when they see any pair of boobs\nwalking around, they have to flirt. It&rsquo;s like they can&rsquo;t help it. Doesn&rsquo;t\nmatter is she&rsquo;s ugly or not. There only half-hearted attempts anyways.&rdquo; I say,\nleaning on the railing. I hear another whistle blow, &ldquo;Hey guys I gotta go, you\ndon&rsquo;t have to stay. It&rsquo;s mostly boring. Bye!&rdquo; I yell, then stop and turn\naround. &ldquo;Oh, do you all want my number?&rdquo; Pete stops, Ned nods enthusiastically,\nand MJ hands me her phone. I put my number in and then descend the steps, going\nback to practice.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>Next\nPart: COMING SOON!</b></p>",
