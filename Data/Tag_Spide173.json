Nan (a former Nanny who deals in conflict resolution for businesses) spends a grand majority of the novel towing the line of a toxic environment that breeds rampant bullying and victim blaming among young, rich and ignorant children of wealthy families, (because she wants money to fix up an old row house in a gentrified neighborhood), and it\u2019s only by sheer luck that the circumstances she does nothing to change end up rectifying themselves through the hubris of a character that is barely present in the narrative. It\u2019s such a train-wreck of a book, I couldn\u2019t put it down, honestly. I could understand her perspective in the original novel, but here, she\u2019s not remotely sympathetic (which wasn\u2019t the author\u2019s intent, clearly). It kinda makes me thankful the film for the first novel chose to end things with some kind of resolution (that was a direct result of the characters <i>changing</i> to some degree, lmao).</p><p><i>3.

On top of that, he surrounds Miguel with some fantastic supporting characters. Volume two is about twelve issues long (cut short by the <i>Secret Wars</i> event), but it\u2019s a solid read and a good time with some fantastic artwork by William Sliney.</p><p><i>4. Spider-Man 2099 (Volume 3)</i> \u2013 <b>Peter David</b>\u00a0- (2015-2017) \u2013 The third volume of Spider-Man 2099 picks up where Spider-Man 2099, or Secret Wars 2099 and Secret Wars in general, left off. Miguel is still trying to repair the past, but now he\u2019s dealing with the added stress of a romantic relationship with Tempest Monroe (no apparent relation to Storm) and his biological father (Tyler Stone) and the ever-changing world of 2099 actively trying to fuck things up for him. The series lasts up 25 or less issues and goes places I honestly wasn\u2019t anticipating or expecting. Silney and David are on their A-game here and the conclusion left me wanting more \u2013 in a good way.

That sleepy reminder eventually kicked in and I borrowed it during the summer. The best impression I could give you is that it a lot like <i>Coraline</i> in the sense that it\u2019s about a young girl who finds a hidden world inside an old house she and her family move into. What it lacks is the cautionary tale beyond your run of the mill child-experiences-hubris-then-fixes-mistake-caused-by-hubris. The combination of illustrations elevates the story that is fairly visual-reliant.

Nanny Returns </i>- <b>Emma McLaughlin and Nicola Kraus</b>\u00a0- (2009) \u2013 <i>Nanny Returns</i> is probably an interesting case of the author who assumes a character has learned something, but nothing about their experience throughout the narrative really reflects \u2013 or earns that. Nan (a former Nanny who deals in conflict resolution for businesses) spends a grand majority of the novel towing the line of a toxic environment that breeds rampant bullying and victim blaming among young, rich and ignorant children of wealthy families, (because she wants money to fix up an old row house in a gentrified neighborhood), and it\u2019s only by sheer luck that the circumstances she does nothing to change end up rectifying themselves through the hubris of a character that is barely present in the narrative. It\u2019s such a train-wreck of a book, I couldn\u2019t put it down, honestly. I could understand her perspective in the original novel, but here, she\u2019s not remotely sympathetic (which wasn\u2019t the author\u2019s intent, clearly). It kinda makes me thankful the film for the first novel chose to end things with some kind of resolution (that was a direct result of the characters <i>changing</i> to some degree, lmao).</p><p><i>3.

On top of that, he surrounds Miguel with some fantastic supporting characters. Volume two is about twelve issues long (cut short by the <i>Secret Wars</i> event), but it\u2019s a solid read and a good time with some fantastic artwork by William Sliney.</p><p><i>4. Spider-Man 2099 (Volume 3)</i> \u2013 <b>Peter David</b>\u00a0- (2015-2017) \u2013 The third volume of Spider-Man 2099 picks up where Spider-Man 2099, or Secret Wars 2099 and Secret Wars in general, left off. Miguel is still trying to repair the past, but now he\u2019s dealing with the added stress of a romantic relationship with Tempest Monroe (no apparent relation to Storm) and his biological father (Tyler Stone) and the ever-changing world of 2099 actively trying to fuck things up for him. The series lasts up 25 or less issues and goes places I honestly wasn\u2019t anticipating or expecting. Silney and David are on their A-game here and the conclusion left me wanting more \u2013 in a good way. It\u2019s a relatively solid end to a series I never really expected would see the light of day again.</p><p><i>5.

That sleepy reminder eventually kicked in and I borrowed it during the summer. The best impression I could give you is that it a lot like <i>Coraline</i> in the sense that it\u2019s about a young girl who finds a hidden world inside an old house she and her family move into. What it lacks is the cautionary tale beyond your run of the mill child-experiences-hubris-then-fixes-mistake-caused-by-hubris. The combination of illustrations elevates the story that is fairly visual-reliant. There are like six or seven books in the series, I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019ll read them, but the first book ends conclusively enough that don\u2019t really need to worry about what follows.</p><p><i>6.
