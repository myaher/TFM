Also I have a couple of requests in my ask box I HAVE NOT FORGOTTEN!! This just so happened to be requested first&hellip;. by&hellip;. a lot of people. So here it is&hellip;. As always please let me know if you have any requests!</p><p><b>Word Count</b>: 1724</p><p><b>Warnings</b>: Sadness</p><p><b>Summary</b>: You and Chris met at the caf\u00e9 after your breakup. A thousand things could happen, but getting dragged along isn\u2019t one of them.</p><p>&mdash;<br/></p><p>The next few moments had felt surreal. You hadn\u2019t needed to\nsay anything to your boss. They looked at you and shook their head, brilliant\nblues peaking out through otherwise inky hair, and it distracted you for a\nmoment.</p><p>Sky placed a hand on your shoulder and you looked into their\neyes, \u201cYou go do you, I\u2019ll cover your shift.\u201d</p><!-- more --><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d You asked nervously, thinking about all the\nshifts they had covered already. Thinking about the mountains of favors you\nalready owed Sky was more than enough to reach the peak of Everest, and it made\nyou a little anxious.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure. Go get things sorted.\u201d</p><p>Your lips twitched as you nodded, forcing yourself to stand\nyour ground for a moment to gather yourself. A well of emotions boiled at the\npit of your stomach, but you already felt so drained, and tired, and empty.</p><p>How could you survive what happened next?</p><p>Your phone buzzed, a shock of vibration against your palm. You\nlooked down at it and Sky\u2014with a knowing smile\u2014gestured to the door. \u201cGet out\nof here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll put my phone on loud in case you need me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t, just go.\u201d Sky crossed their arms in annoyance.</p><p>Not looking a gift horse in the mouth, you vacantly stumbled\nforward, your phone held tightly against your hand.</p><p>\u201cKeep looking like that and he\u2019ll think that we torture you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you though?\u201d The words felt dry on your tongue but it\nmade Sky chuckle.</p><p>It was the small steps.</p><p>Making your way through the halls felt more like a dream\nthan you\u2019d like to admit, you smiled and nodded when people said hello but it\nhadn\u2019t quite met your eyes. If everything didn\u2019t go perfectly\u2014if this meeting\nwasn\u2019t to get back together\u2014you knew that it was a <i>real </i>goodbye and you didn\u2019t\nknow if you could handle a second round of pain.</p><p>But you still made it out to his car, and opened the door. You\nstill got in and buckled up and tried to sink into the seat and become one with\nthe passenger side. If you could avoid looking at him, maybe you could pretend\nthat nothing had happened and that you hadn\u2019t been feeling well, and that was\nwhy Chris was coming to get you from work.</p><p>He seemed to be sitting on the same wave length, putting the\ncar in drive and headed down the five-minute stretch of road to the caf\u00e9.</p><p>When he parked, you could feel his eyes on you and you very\ncarefully pulled your eyes from the window to meet his gaze.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d you said with a severe lack of air in your lungs.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>You sat for a while, looking at him as your eyes began to\nsting and you felt the bubble in your throat that was quickly turning into a\nsob. It was hard to not force yourself out of the door and back to work, to\njust pretend this wasn\u2019t happening, but it was and now you were crying, and\neverything just hurt so bad even though there was nothing to show for it.</p><p>It was always a weird thing, watching breakups on TV or supporting\nyour friends in the midst of recovery. Seeing them break down or get quite and\njust get lost when they saw their respective ex-lovers on the street, or in a restaurant,\nor with someone else. Quietly, you had always wondered if they were being a tab\nbit over-dramatic, but now you knew what it felt like and you <i>never </i>wanted\nto feel that way again.</p><p>And getting back together gave him that power over you again,\njust getting into the car with him in the first place was an admission that you\nhad never really taken that power away.</p><p>You realized\u2014after a moment\u2014that he had nearly pulled you\ninto his lap but had refrained, probably wanting to establish boundaries before\nhe took it too far. In a way, you appreciated and respected the restraint, but\nat the same time you wanted him to just do it. To hell with being a gentleman\nright now.</p><p>Still, though, you felt his hand on your back. Smooth gentle\ncircles, slow and methodical until you calmed down.</p><p>You took a deep breath and felt your cheeks heat with embarrassment.\n\u201cSorry,\u201d you felt your voice crack under the strain.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t apologize.\u201d</p><p>It felt like the sentence wasn\u2019t over, but he left whatever\nelse had been on the tip of his tongue, fade away.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to be okay going inside?\u201d He asked.</p><p>You nodded. Not trusting your voice.</p><p>Getting out of the car was difficult, but you managed. Going\nto the caf\u00e9 you had been avoiding was even harder, but the bustle of conversation\nhid your tear stained cheeks and slumped posture. It let you drift into a\nfaceless mob as you bustled past a few tables to a booth in the back corner by\na fake flower tree.</p><p>It was quiet there and you had time to take a few deep\nbreaths and stare out the window.</p><p>\u201cSorry, they didn\u2019t have the breakfast sandwich you normally\nget so I got the turkey sausage one.\u201d He sat down across from you, placing a smoothie\nin front of you with a hopeful smile.</p><p>You looked at it and then at him and slowly drank some of\nit. Letting the silence between you be filled with the ambient noise.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, the turkey sandwich is good too.\u201d</p><p>He shifted and looked down at the coffee in front of him, \u201cDodger\nmisses you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI miss him too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI miss you.\u201d</p><p>You hadn\u2019t been thinking, and you didn\u2019t miss a beat. \u201cI miss\nyou too.\u201d</p><p>He sat there, tapping the sides of his coffee and you hoped\nthat he felt as awkward as you did. This was all a waiting game; a few moments\nwould pass and no one would say anything. You\u2019d drink your smoothie and he\nwould drink his coffee, and you\u2019d make eye contact and then look away.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d He said. \u201cI hate this, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. It\u2019s kind of weird.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, what do we do now?\u201d</p><p>You squeezed the smoothie cup a little for comfort, \u201cI don\u2019t\nreally know Chris. Can you trust me?\u201d</p><p>When your eyes met, you stomach twisted. His eyes were\nsearching yours and you hoped that he\u2019d find what he was looking for because\u2026\njust because you didn\u2019t know how to be you anymore.</p><p>It was funny that your identity almost seemed to teeter on\nthis very moment. Funny in a sad kind of way. This moment shouldn\u2019t be the end all\nand be all of your life, and deep down you knew it wasn\u2019t. But it <i>felt </i>like\nit and that was all that mattered. Right now, you had to know if he\u2019d ever\ntrust you again after everything. Letting you back into his life wasn\u2019t an easy\nthing to ask for, but you wanted to ask for it anyway.</p><p>You wanted to be selfish. You had to be selfish.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure yet.\u201d</p><p>The words stabbed you as the room went still. The world\nseemed to slow and your vision blurred. Somehow you managed to blink it away,\nto keep your composure and not cry\u2014despite your track record.</p><p>\u201cSo, what do we do now?\u201d You sounded more confident than you\nfelt.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. We talk, I guess. What else can we do?\u201d</p><p>You nodded and drank some more of your smoothie. It was\nalmost gone now. Your eyes met his for a moment, \u201cI don\u2019t want to get dragged\naround while you think about it. I know that\u2019s selfish, but I can\u2019t live in this\nlimbo forever. I,\u201d you took a deep breath, \u201cI mean it\u2019s kind of obvious that I\u2019m\nhaving a hard time, and now this and I just don\u2019t know if I can handle it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can set ground rules while we figure it out. I just need\nsome time to get to know you without the lies and without the pretenses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI,\u201d you wanted to say that you hadn\u2019t lied about anything\nelse, but you couldn\u2019t. Every time you withheld the truth or said you hadn\u2019t known\nsomething about him or hadn\u2019t allowed yourself to properly freak out over\nsomething you saw on TV, it was all lying, wasn\u2019t it? \u201cI understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can stay both stay single for a while until we get\nthings figured out. If something does come up, and we want to move on then\nwell.\u201d He paused.</p><p>\u201cThen we have to just say it. That way no one gets hurt more\nthan they need to.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, pulling out his phone, while one thousand\nthoughts danced around your head. Imagining Chris with anyone else was a\nnightmare that you hadn\u2019t thought of living through.

Go get things sorted.\u201d</p><p>Your lips twitched as you nodded, forcing yourself to stand\nyour ground for a moment to gather yourself. A well of emotions boiled at the\npit of your stomach, but you already felt so drained, and tired, and empty.</p><p>How could you survive what happened next?</p><p>Your phone buzzed, a shock of vibration against your palm. You\nlooked down at it and Sky\u2014with a knowing smile\u2014gestured to the door. \u201cGet out\nof here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll put my phone on loud in case you need me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t, just go.\u201d Sky crossed their arms in annoyance.</p><p>Not looking a gift horse in the mouth, you vacantly stumbled\nforward, your phone held tightly against your hand.</p><p>\u201cKeep looking like that and he\u2019ll think that we torture you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you though?\u201d The words felt dry on your tongue but it\nmade Sky chuckle.</p><p>It was the small steps.</p><p>Making your way through the halls felt more like a dream\nthan you\u2019d like to admit, you smiled and nodded when people said hello but it\nhadn\u2019t quite met your eyes. If everything didn\u2019t go perfectly\u2014if this meeting\nwasn\u2019t to get back together\u2014you knew that it was a <i>real </i>goodbye and you didn\u2019t\nknow if you could handle a second round of pain.</p><p>But you still made it out to his car, and opened the door. You\nstill got in and buckled up and tried to sink into the seat and become one with\nthe passenger side. If you could avoid looking at him, maybe you could pretend\nthat nothing had happened and that you hadn\u2019t been feeling well, and that was\nwhy Chris was coming to get you from work.</p><p>He seemed to be sitting on the same wave length, putting the\ncar in drive and headed down the five-minute stretch of road to the caf\u00e9.</p><p>When he parked, you could feel his eyes on you and you very\ncarefully pulled your eyes from the window to meet his gaze.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d you said with a severe lack of air in your lungs.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>You sat for a while, looking at him as your eyes began to\nsting and you felt the bubble in your throat that was quickly turning into a\nsob. It was hard to not force yourself out of the door and back to work, to\njust pretend this wasn\u2019t happening, but it was and now you were crying, and\neverything just hurt so bad even though there was nothing to show for it.</p><p>It was always a weird thing, watching breakups on TV or supporting\nyour friends in the midst of recovery. Seeing them break down or get quite and\njust get lost when they saw their respective ex-lovers on the street, or in a restaurant,\nor with someone else. Quietly, you had always wondered if they were being a tab\nbit over-dramatic, but now you knew what it felt like and you <i>never </i>wanted\nto feel that way again.</p><p>And getting back together gave him that power over you again,\njust getting into the car with him in the first place was an admission that you\nhad never really taken that power away.</p><p>You realized\u2014after a moment\u2014that he had nearly pulled you\ninto his lap but had refrained, probably wanting to establish boundaries before\nhe took it too far. In a way, you appreciated and respected the restraint, but\nat the same time you wanted him to just do it. To hell with being a gentleman\nright now.</p><p>Still, though, you felt his hand on your back. Smooth gentle\ncircles, slow and methodical until you calmed down.</p><p>You took a deep breath and felt your cheeks heat with embarrassment.\n\u201cSorry,\u201d you felt your voice crack under the strain.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t apologize.\u201d</p><p>It felt like the sentence wasn\u2019t over, but he left whatever\nelse had been on the tip of his tongue, fade away.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to be okay going inside?\u201d He asked.</p><p>You nodded. Not trusting your voice.</p><p>Getting out of the car was difficult, but you managed. Going\nto the caf\u00e9 you had been avoiding was even harder, but the bustle of conversation\nhid your tear stained cheeks and slumped posture. It let you drift into a\nfaceless mob as you bustled past a few tables to a booth in the back corner by\na fake flower tree.</p><p>It was quiet there and you had time to take a few deep\nbreaths and stare out the window.</p><p>\u201cSorry, they didn\u2019t have the breakfast sandwich you normally\nget so I got the turkey sausage one.\u201d He sat down across from you, placing a smoothie\nin front of you with a hopeful smile.</p><p>You looked at it and then at him and slowly drank some of\nit. Letting the silence between you be filled with the ambient noise.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, the turkey sandwich is good too.\u201d</p><p>He shifted and looked down at the coffee in front of him, \u201cDodger\nmisses you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI miss him too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI miss you.\u201d</p><p>You hadn\u2019t been thinking, and you didn\u2019t miss a beat. \u201cI miss\nyou too.\u201d</p><p>He sat there, tapping the sides of his coffee and you hoped\nthat he felt as awkward as you did. This was all a waiting game; a few moments\nwould pass and no one would say anything. You\u2019d drink your smoothie and he\nwould drink his coffee, and you\u2019d make eye contact and then look away.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d He said. \u201cI hate this, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. It\u2019s kind of weird.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, what do we do now?\u201d</p><p>You squeezed the smoothie cup a little for comfort, \u201cI don\u2019t\nreally know Chris. Can you trust me?\u201d</p><p>When your eyes met, you stomach twisted. His eyes were\nsearching yours and you hoped that he\u2019d find what he was looking for because\u2026\njust because you didn\u2019t know how to be you anymore.</p><p>It was funny that your identity almost seemed to teeter on\nthis very moment. Funny in a sad kind of way. This moment shouldn\u2019t be the end all\nand be all of your life, and deep down you knew it wasn\u2019t. But it <i>felt </i>like\nit and that was all that mattered. Right now, you had to know if he\u2019d ever\ntrust you again after everything. Letting you back into his life wasn\u2019t an easy\nthing to ask for, but you wanted to ask for it anyway.</p><p>You wanted to be selfish. You had to be selfish.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure yet.\u201d</p><p>The words stabbed you as the room went still. The world\nseemed to slow and your vision blurred. Somehow you managed to blink it away,\nto keep your composure and not cry\u2014despite your track record.</p><p>\u201cSo, what do we do now?\u201d You sounded more confident than you\nfelt.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. We talk, I guess. What else can we do?\u201d</p><p>You nodded and drank some more of your smoothie. It was\nalmost gone now. Your eyes met his for a moment, \u201cI don\u2019t want to get dragged\naround while you think about it. I know that\u2019s selfish, but I can\u2019t live in this\nlimbo forever. I,\u201d you took a deep breath, \u201cI mean it\u2019s kind of obvious that I\u2019m\nhaving a hard time, and now this and I just don\u2019t know if I can handle it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can set ground rules while we figure it out. I just need\nsome time to get to know you without the lies and without the pretenses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI,\u201d you wanted to say that you hadn\u2019t lied about anything\nelse, but you couldn\u2019t. Every time you withheld the truth or said you hadn\u2019t known\nsomething about him or hadn\u2019t allowed yourself to properly freak out over\nsomething you saw on TV, it was all lying, wasn\u2019t it? \u201cI understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can stay both stay single for a while until we get\nthings figured out. If something does come up, and we want to move on then\nwell.\u201d He paused.</p><p>\u201cThen we have to just say it. That way no one gets hurt more\nthan they need to.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, pulling out his phone, while one thousand\nthoughts danced around your head. Imagining Chris with anyone else was a\nnightmare that you hadn\u2019t thought of living through. You thought he was texting\nsomeone with how much he was fiddling with his phone, until your pocket started\nbuzzing.</p><p>You had no time to react, \u201cWHEN CAPTIAN AMERICA THROWS HIS\nMIGHT SHEILD!!!\u201d cut away any adult thoughts you may have had.</p><p>You fumbled and nearly fell out your chair in an effort to\nsilence the device that had betrayed your very existence. Roaring laughter spilt\nfrom Chris\u2019s lips as he leaned back, hand over his chest as he nearly sank into\na puddle on his seat. </p><p>You were a complete mess as you practically threw your head\nonto the table, trying to avoid dying from embarrassment as his laughter died\ndown.</p><p>You finally looked up, pouting as you began to recover from\nhis terrible sense of humor. \u201cThat\u2019s not funny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had to make sure you didn\u2019t change it.\u201d His eyes sparkled\nand you smiled.</p><p>Even with your cheek pressed against the cool metal table, in\nthe worst possible angle ever, he beamed at you.

Letting the silence between you be filled with the ambient noise.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, the turkey sandwich is good too.\u201d</p><p>He shifted and looked down at the coffee in front of him, \u201cDodger\nmisses you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI miss him too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI miss you.\u201d</p><p>You hadn\u2019t been thinking, and you didn\u2019t miss a beat. \u201cI miss\nyou too.\u201d</p><p>He sat there, tapping the sides of his coffee and you hoped\nthat he felt as awkward as you did. This was all a waiting game; a few moments\nwould pass and no one would say anything. You\u2019d drink your smoothie and he\nwould drink his coffee, and you\u2019d make eye contact and then look away.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d He said. \u201cI hate this, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. It\u2019s kind of weird.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, what do we do now?\u201d</p><p>You squeezed the smoothie cup a little for comfort, \u201cI don\u2019t\nreally know Chris. Can you trust me?\u201d</p><p>When your eyes met, you stomach twisted. His eyes were\nsearching yours and you hoped that he\u2019d find what he was looking for because\u2026\njust because you didn\u2019t know how to be you anymore.</p><p>It was funny that your identity almost seemed to teeter on\nthis very moment. Funny in a sad kind of way. This moment shouldn\u2019t be the end all\nand be all of your life, and deep down you knew it wasn\u2019t. But it <i>felt </i>like\nit and that was all that mattered. Right now, you had to know if he\u2019d ever\ntrust you again after everything. Letting you back into his life wasn\u2019t an easy\nthing to ask for, but you wanted to ask for it anyway.</p><p>You wanted to be selfish. You had to be selfish.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure yet.\u201d</p><p>The words stabbed you as the room went still. The world\nseemed to slow and your vision blurred. Somehow you managed to blink it away,\nto keep your composure and not cry\u2014despite your track record.</p><p>\u201cSo, what do we do now?\u201d You sounded more confident than you\nfelt.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. We talk, I guess. What else can we do?\u201d</p><p>You nodded and drank some more of your smoothie. It was\nalmost gone now. Your eyes met his for a moment, \u201cI don\u2019t want to get dragged\naround while you think about it. I know that\u2019s selfish, but I can\u2019t live in this\nlimbo forever. I,\u201d you took a deep breath, \u201cI mean it\u2019s kind of obvious that I\u2019m\nhaving a hard time, and now this and I just don\u2019t know if I can handle it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can set ground rules while we figure it out. I just need\nsome time to get to know you without the lies and without the pretenses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI,\u201d you wanted to say that you hadn\u2019t lied about anything\nelse, but you couldn\u2019t. Every time you withheld the truth or said you hadn\u2019t known\nsomething about him or hadn\u2019t allowed yourself to properly freak out over\nsomething you saw on TV, it was all lying, wasn\u2019t it? \u201cI understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can stay both stay single for a while until we get\nthings figured out. If something does come up, and we want to move on then\nwell.\u201d He paused.</p><p>\u201cThen we have to just say it. That way no one gets hurt more\nthan they need to.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, pulling out his phone, while one thousand\nthoughts danced around your head. Imagining Chris with anyone else was a\nnightmare that you hadn\u2019t thought of living through. You thought he was texting\nsomeone with how much he was fiddling with his phone, until your pocket started\nbuzzing.</p><p>You had no time to react, \u201cWHEN CAPTIAN AMERICA THROWS HIS\nMIGHT SHEILD!!!\u201d cut away any adult thoughts you may have had.</p><p>You fumbled and nearly fell out your chair in an effort to\nsilence the device that had betrayed your very existence. Roaring laughter spilt\nfrom Chris\u2019s lips as he leaned back, hand over his chest as he nearly sank into\na puddle on his seat. </p><p>You were a complete mess as you practically threw your head\nonto the table, trying to avoid dying from embarrassment as his laughter died\ndown.</p><p>You finally looked up, pouting as you began to recover from\nhis terrible sense of humor. \u201cThat\u2019s not funny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had to make sure you didn\u2019t change it.\u201d His eyes sparkled\nand you smiled.</p><p>Even with your cheek pressed against the cool metal table, in\nthe worst possible angle ever, he beamed at you. Leaning back against and taking\na deep drink of his coffee.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s work been?\u201d</p><p>You groaned, \u201cYou might want to order some tea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a Chris not a Tom, or did you forget?\u201d</p><p>You rolled your eyes, \u201cI meant for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d He still got up even though it was <i>complicated</i>,\nand you prepared to tell the complete truth. And if you were honest with\nyourself, you weren\u2019t as nervous as you thought you\u2019d be.</p><p>It was actually rather liberating.</p></p>",

As always please let me know if you have any requests!</p><p><b>Word Count</b>: 1724</p><p><b>Warnings</b>: Sadness</p><p><b>Summary</b>: You and Chris met at the caf&eacute; after your breakup. A thousand things could happen, but getting dragged along isn&rsquo;t one of them.</p><p>&mdash;<br /></p><p>The next few moments had felt surreal. You hadn&rsquo;t needed to\nsay anything to your boss. They looked at you and shook their head, brilliant\nblues peaking out through otherwise inky hair, and it distracted you for a\nmoment.</p><p>Sky placed a hand on your shoulder and you looked into their\neyes, &ldquo;You go do you, I&rsquo;ll cover your shift.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo; You asked nervously, thinking about all the\nshifts they had covered already. Thinking about the mountains of favors you\nalready owed Sky was more than enough to reach the peak of Everest, and it made\nyou a little anxious.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure. Go get things sorted.&rdquo;</p><p>Your lips twitched as you nodded, forcing yourself to stand\nyour ground for a moment to gather yourself. A well of emotions boiled at the\npit of your stomach, but you already felt so drained, and tired, and empty.</p><p>How could you survive what happened next?</p><p>Your phone buzzed, a shock of vibration against your palm. You\nlooked down at it and Sky&mdash;with a knowing smile&mdash;gestured to the door. &ldquo;Get out\nof here.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll put my phone on loud in case you need me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t, just go.&rdquo; Sky crossed their arms in annoyance.</p><p>Not looking a gift horse in the mouth, you vacantly stumbled\nforward, your phone held tightly against your hand.</p><p>&ldquo;Keep looking like that and he&rsquo;ll think that we torture you!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you though?&rdquo; The words felt dry on your tongue but it\nmade Sky chuckle.</p><p>It was the small steps.</p><p>Making your way through the halls felt more like a dream\nthan you&rsquo;d like to admit, you smiled and nodded when people said hello but it\nhadn&rsquo;t quite met your eyes. If everything didn&rsquo;t go perfectly&mdash;if this meeting\nwasn&rsquo;t to get back together&mdash;you knew that it was a <i>real </i>goodbye and you didn&rsquo;t\nknow if you could handle a second round of pain.</p><p>But you still made it out to his car, and opened the door. You\nstill got in and buckled up and tried to sink into the seat and become one with\nthe passenger side. If you could avoid looking at him, maybe you could pretend\nthat nothing had happened and that you hadn&rsquo;t been feeling well, and that was\nwhy Chris was coming to get you from work.</p><p>He seemed to be sitting on the same wave length, putting the\ncar in drive and headed down the five-minute stretch of road to the caf&eacute;.</p><p>When he parked, you could feel his eyes on you and you very\ncarefully pulled your eyes from the window to meet his gaze.</p><p>&ldquo;Hi,&rdquo; you said with a severe lack of air in your lungs.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey.&rdquo;</p><p>You sat for a while, looking at him as your eyes began to\nsting and you felt the bubble in your throat that was quickly turning into a\nsob. It was hard to not force yourself out of the door and back to work, to\njust pretend this wasn&rsquo;t happening, but it was and now you were crying, and\neverything just hurt so bad even though there was nothing to show for it.</p><p>It was always a weird thing, watching breakups on TV or supporting\nyour friends in the midst of recovery. Seeing them break down or get quite and\njust get lost when they saw their respective ex-lovers on the street, or in a restaurant,\nor with someone else. Quietly, you had always wondered if they were being a tab\nbit over-dramatic, but now you knew what it felt like and you <i>never </i>wanted\nto feel that way again.</p><p>And getting back together gave him that power over you again,\njust getting into the car with him in the first place was an admission that you\nhad never really taken that power away.</p><p>You realized&mdash;after a moment&mdash;that he had nearly pulled you\ninto his lap but had refrained, probably wanting to establish boundaries before\nhe took it too far. In a way, you appreciated and respected the restraint, but\nat the same time you wanted him to just do it. To hell with being a gentleman\nright now.</p><p>Still, though, you felt his hand on your back. Smooth gentle\ncircles, slow and methodical until you calmed down.</p><p>You took a deep breath and felt your cheeks heat with embarrassment.\n&ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; you felt your voice crack under the strain.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t apologize.&rdquo;</p><p>It felt like the sentence wasn&rsquo;t over, but he left whatever\nelse had been on the tip of his tongue, fade away.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you going to be okay going inside?&rdquo; He asked.</p><p>You nodded. Not trusting your voice.</p><p>Getting out of the car was difficult, but you managed. Going\nto the caf&eacute; you had been avoiding was even harder, but the bustle of conversation\nhid your tear stained cheeks and slumped posture. It let you drift into a\nfaceless mob as you bustled past a few tables to a booth in the back corner by\na fake flower tree.</p><p>It was quiet there and you had time to take a few deep\nbreaths and stare out the window.</p><p>&ldquo;Sorry, they didn&rsquo;t have the breakfast sandwich you normally\nget so I got the turkey sausage one.&rdquo; He sat down across from you, placing a smoothie\nin front of you with a hopeful smile.</p><p>You looked at it and then at him and slowly drank some of\nit.
