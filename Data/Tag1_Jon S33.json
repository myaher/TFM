All season, he's seen Dany make passive-aggressive comments about Sansa and he's tried not to react. But here, just Arya mentioning Sansa has him scared to death. This is the real Jon (when he is with Arya, Sansa and Sam.) Everything else is pretence, IMO. I feel Jon's feeble attempts to defend Dany to Tyrion later have more to do with his identity crisis (that weirdly hasn't been addressed directly).",
        "answer": "<blockquote><p><i>\u00a02/3 What gets Jon fired up? When Tyrion says Dany\u2019s nature is fire and blood. This upsets Jon NOT because he believes in Dany, but because he feels it\u2019s an attack on him. His defends her because if what Tyrion says is true, then what if he is the same. So he scrambles to make an excuse for her rage. Maybe he\u2019s recalling how he let his rage take over in the past, with Ramsay, LF. If he had a dragon, would he have done the same? Immediately, Tyrion asks if he\u2019d have done the same and Jon falters.\n\n<br/></i></p><p><i>\n\n3/3 The show seemed desperate to incorporate \u201clove is death of duty\u201d here, but it doesn\u2019t apply. Jon isn\u2019t in love with Dany. Tyrion talks realm, Jon\u2019s own life being in danger, none of which stir him to action. Tyrion then asks about Sansa, similar to Varys with Ned in S1 (\u201clove is death of duty\u201d doesn\u2019t apply here either), which gives Jon pause. He chooses Sansa over Dany. Sansa = familial/romantic love, not duty. Like Ned, this was about love (Sansa) vs honor (killing his kin and Queen).\n\n</i><br/></p></blockquote><hr><p>You\u2019ve hit the nail on the head, anon.</p><p>When I watched this episode, I was so disappointed that the leaks were true that I just watched on in exasperation and detachment. And even though I picked up on a few things (like the repeated mention of Sansa affecting Jon, and Jon\u2019s head shake at the claim he loves Dany), I still read the scene like most people did: Jon defended Dany which felt like a complete retcon from what happened in the previous episode and also felt very out of character for Jon.<br/></p><p>I was so sick of the show that I didn\u2019t really want to dig deeper, but yesterday\u00a0I rewatched a few scenes and you\u2019re right. <b>Jon\u2019s defending himself</b>.</p><p>But let\u2019s rewind. I\u2019d like to go through the scenes before we reach the makeshift cell scene, because those scenes\u00a0<i>should</i> inform how we read Jon\u2019s interactions with Tyrion and Dany later. <b>Jon keeps <i>showing</i> us that he doesn\u2019t agree with her actions</b>, after all.</p><p>(<i>Oh, and this will be long, but it has visual aids. Yay?</i>)</p><!-- more --><p><b>In 8.05 Jon sort of goes against order</b>. Granted, Dany never commanded him to keep fighting, but she keeps fighting and Grey Worm keeps fighting. If Jon really truly followed Dany, he would keep fighting too. But his morals stop him. He sheathes his sword and tries getting everyone out of the city.</p><p>Then 8.06 starts. We follow Tyrion (with Jon and Davos close behind) walking back into King\u2019s Landing on a street littered with corpses and ashes and crumbled buildings.<b> They stop at the charred remains of the mother and child Arya tried to help.</b> The little girl still holding her toy horse. Tyrion tells Jon he\u2019ll find him later to which Jon replies,\u00a0\u201c<b><i>It\u2019s not safe. Let me send some men with you.</i>\u201d</b></p><p>Why isn\u2019t it safe? We don\u2019t know whether Tyrion has told Jon about Jaime, but it\u2019s most likely common knowledge by now and Tyrion did include Davos in his betrayal. It was from Davos Tyrion asked the favor to help in smuggling Cersei and Jaime to Pentos. <b>We don\u2019t <i>need</i> to see Davos and Tyrion telling Jon. It\u2019s implied that he knows.</b>\u00a0And when Tyrion tells Jon,\u00a0\u201c<i>I\u2019m going alone</i>,\u201d and Jon follows him with his eyes as Tyrion leaves, the look on Jon\u2019s face also implies he knows that Tyrion will try to find out whether his family made it out. Jon\u2019s not afraid that a King\u2019s Landing survivor will attack Tyrion; <b>Jon is afraid of what Dany will do if she gets her hands on Tyrion</b>. <b>And</b> <b>Jon sending men with Tyrion to protect him is <i>also</i> defying Dany.</b></p><p>After this, Jon interrupts Grey Worm while the latter sentences prisoners of war to die in the name of his queen. Both Jon and Davos argue for the prisoners to remain alive; however, GW has different orders.</p><blockquote><p><b>GW</b>: \u201cI obey my queen\u2019s commands, not yours.\u201d<br/><b>Jon</b>: \u201cAnd what are the queen\u2019s commands?\u201d<br/><b>GW</b>: \u201cKill all who follow Cersei Lannister.\u201d</p></blockquote><figure data-orig-width=\"380\" data-orig-height=\"205\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/4c90111dea10106888bd1153b46b8c23/tumblr_inline_ps42x0F4Ng1upc2qw_1280.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"380\" data-orig-height=\"205\"/></figure><p><b>Jon physically stops Grey Worm from following these orders and\u00a0once more Jon defies Dany. </b>Everyone around them draws their weapons. Jon and Grey Worm enter a staring match, and it\u2019s Davos who brings Jon back by telling him they need to speak to the queen. And yet it still takes Jon a long moment to step back. He glances at the prisoners, deliberating, looks back at GW. He doesn\u2019t want to let GW kill them, but he also knows that if he and his men engage in a battle against the Unsullied, Jon puts even more people at risk. Especially his family, who\u2019ll suffer if Dany learns that Jon fought her men. So he makes his decision and walks away.</p><p>As he walks through the square, surrounded by Dothraki,<b> low and dark music drones ominously in the background. Jon looks hard</b>.

The tension in his mouth doesn\u2019t quite reach Jon Snow Growl status, but it\u2019s not far from it.<br/></p><p>I think <b>Jon knew that he was heading into a situation that would end with bloodshed in some way or another and he was preparing himself mentally</b>. Grey Worm has kept an eye on Jon\u2019s treasonous behavior. He\u00a0will report to his queen first chance he gets\u2013and Jon and Dany have a strained relationship as it is. But Jon can\u2019t run away either. If he does, Dany will fly after him or even attack his home and his family. All he can do is move forward and try working out a plan.</p><p>Dany holds her terrifying speech and we get a reaction shot of <b>Jon watching her with a dark look in his eyes</b>. It\u2019s in these moments\u2013when she can\u2019t see his face\u2013we\u2019re allowed to see Jon\u2019s true feelings. There\u2019s no love in his eyes. No heartbreak.

A long look. One that, perhaps, was supposed to make us worried she\u2019d have Jon escorted off to a cell too. But she only stares at him with contempt before leaving (which makes her quick change in mood later rather odd but, well, apparently EC disagrees). As she walks away, Jon does not follow the ~love of his life~ with his eyes. <b>Not until she and the Unsullied have safely passed him does he turn around and glare at her.</b></p><figure data-orig-width=\"380\" data-orig-height=\"215\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/49c3fdb801f2243d8cd5bc4555299c48/tumblr_inline_ps46gcgEjC1upc2qw_1280.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"380\" data-orig-height=\"215\"/></figure><p><b>He <i>loathes</i> her.</b> I think even looking at her leaves him with a bad taste in his mouth. There\u2019s nothing about his behavior that suggests to me that this is a guy who just realized the woman of his dreams was a monster. He knew. Perhaps not that she was quite <i>this</i> much of a monster. But he knew.</p><p>After Arya pops up out of nowhere, they have a conversation about Dany. Arya calls Dany Jon\u2019s queen (as she often does) and Jon replies with,\u00a0<b>\u201c<i>She\u2019s everyone\u2019s queen now</i>.\u201d</b> His voice is gravelly and the way he delivers it, it\u2019s clear he doesn\u2019t think that\u2019s a good thing. It\u2019s clear he and Arya stand on one side, and Dany on the other. He could just as well have said,\u00a0<b>\u201c<i>Welcome to hell</i>.\u201d </b>That\u2019s the kind of delivery he gives.</p><p>What follows next has annoyed me and others, because <b>Arya says two things to Jon that Tyrion repeats in the makeshift cell scene</b>. It annoyed me and others because why repeat it? <b>What\u2019s the point?</b></p><h2><b>Contrast</b>.</h2><p><b>Jon reacts one way to Arya and a <i>whole</i> different way to Tyrion.</b> It\u2019s not inconsistency but a chance for us to compare the real Jon (with Arya) and political!Jon/sacrifical!jon (with Tyrion). It\u2019s not well-written, to be clear, but I do believe this is why they did it. Their clumsy way of giving clues.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"380\" data-orig-height=\"169\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b398a93dd9fd94ee2d5dedbf09f1b83a/tumblr_inline_ps47b1sdQF1upc2qw_1280.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"380\" data-orig-height=\"169\"/></figure><p><b>When Arya points out Sansa won\u2019t ever bend to Dany, Jon doesn\u2019t protest.

He\u2019s tried avoiding confrontation with Dany because she\u2019s a dangerous woman to confront, but it\u2019s now become unavoidable. She mentioned Winterfell in her speech. She hates Sansa. She knows Sansa spread her secret. It\u2019s only a matter of time.</p><p>I\u2019m still not entirely sure what Jon\u2019s plan was here, but when he tells\u00a0Arya to wait for him outside the city gates, I think he was a man on a mission already. Perhaps he was considering killing Drogon (which would leave Dany just another regular foe. Her armies against his).

Not at all.</p><p>They keep <i>showing</i> us how Jon feels about her. <b>When Dany can\u2019t see him, Jon shows his true feelings.

When Tyrion says he betrayed his queen, Jon tells him he didn\u2019t because contrary to what the characters and the cast and the crew try telling us constantly, Jon isn\u2019t so far up Dany\u2019s ass that he can\u2019t tell right from wrong anymore. Tyrion released his brother.

There\u2019s even a hint of an incredulous amusement, as if <b>he thinks Tyrion is a god damn hypocrite and he can\u2019t believe the words coming out of the guy\u2019s mouth.</b></p><p>Jon seems to think,\u00a0<b>\u201c<i>If you knew all along what she is, then why the hell did you help her in invading Westeros? Why did you snitch on Varys when Varys was trying to </i>stop<i> her?</i>\u201d</b> And it\u2019s easy for Jon to judge. He got involved with Dany because death was coming and he believed he needed her dragons and her armies to stop it. He did what he had to to save everyone he loves and, you know, the world. And he\u2019s stayed by Dany\u2019s side because he needed to protect his family from her. What was Tyrion\u2019s excuse?<br/></p><p><b>Then comes the complete switch in Jon\u2019s attitude. </b>The switch that you, anon, brought up: Tyrion makes this about House words. He makes it about <i><b>blood</b></i>.</p><blockquote><p><i><b>T:\u00a0</b>\u201cOur queen\u2019s nature is fire and blood\u2013\u201d</i></p><p><i><b>J:\u00a0</b>\u201cYou think our house words are stamped on our bodies when we\u2019re born and that\u2019s who we are? Then I\u2019d be fire and blood too.\u201c</i></p></blockquote><h2><b><i>\u201cThen I\u2019d be fire and blood too.\u201d</i></b></h2><p>Finally, Jon\u2019s identity crisis is addressed: he\u2019s triggered by the suggestion that he and Dany could be the same.</p><p>Unfortunately, this is not just way too damn late. It\u2019s also badly written because it\u2019s so very contrived.</p><p><b>I think this scene mostly exists for two reasons:</b> they needed someone to explain to the audience why assassinating Dany was justified, to point out that this is her pattern, and make sure we all knew that she needed to be stopped. Which is hamfisted and insulting to the audience\u2019s intelligence. But they also wanted to <i>actually</i> insult their audience by pointing out that those of us who\u2019ve cheered Dany on were part of the problem. We\u2019ve accepted her horrible deeds without questioning. We\u2019ve cheered her on and she\u2019s grown stronger and stronger as an icon until she became the face of this show. They\u2019re basically slapping their audience in the face for drinking the koolaid they gave us.<br/></p><h2>But they\u2019re also asking a rather interesting question that, in better hands, could\u2019ve made this scene very compelling: if it were you, <b>if you were the one with almost unlimited power, would you be any better?</b></h2><p>If you could round up really bad criminals and burn them alive without repercussions, would you do it? Would you do it even if you weren\u2019t 100% sure everyone was guilty? If someone told you 9 out of 10 were guilty of human trafficking but that one was innocent and you couldn\u2019t know whom, would you still do it? Would you think that sacrificing one person to make the world a better place would be worth it?</p><p>Daenerys thinks so. She would sacrifice thousands. Possibly even millions. But would you? Would Jon? Another\u00a0Targaryen who has ridden dragons and who has an inner beast that appears every so often. When he killed Janos Slynt, when he beat Ramsay to a pulp, when he throttled Littlefinger.</p><p><b>Jon is a hot-headed guy and a killer and a Targaryen.</b> And now he\u2019s facing a very important question:\u00a0<b>If Dany is a monster because she\u2019s fire and blood, then what does that make Jon? </b>If Dany is her father, then what does that make Jon?</p><p>His biological father was hardly an admirable man. He abandoned his wife and children for a teenager to fulfill a prophecy, something Jon would never ever do. And yet he has spent the last few weeks lying to his family while banging a woman he doesn\u2019t love just to get her dragons. Something Ned Stark would\u00a0<i>never</i>\u00a0do, but perhaps Rhaegar would.</p><p>\n\nWhen Jon defends Dany by giving weak excuses, he\u2019s not actually defending Dany. He\u2019s doing his best not to examine or even acknowledge his identity crisis, because that would mean examining himself and the things he\u2019s done he\u2019s not proud of<b>. He\u2019d have to wonder: is this the Targaryen in me?</b></p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cI\u2019m tired of fighting.\nIt\u2019s all I\u2019ve done since I left home.\nI\u2019ve killed brothers of the Night\u2019s Watch.\nI\u2019ve killed wildlings.\nI\u2019ve killed men that I admire.\nI hanged a boy younger than Bran.\u201c</i></p></blockquote><p>And he\u2019s killed on the battlefield. He\u2019s most likely lost count of how many men he\u2019s killed by now. And he knows well how rage can take over, how blood lust can take over until you\u2019re completely lost. The way he just saw his men lose it when they started attacking anything that moved despite the bells sounding out surrender.</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201c<b>Aye, it\u2019s easy to judge when you\u2019re standing far from the battlefield.</b>\u201c<br/></i></p></blockquote><h2>Then Tyrion says something that catches Jon off guard completely. The thing Jon doesn\u2019t want to ask himself:\u00a0<b>\u201d<i>Would you have done it?</i>\u201d<br/></b></h2><p>Jon is taken aback at first. Then he claims he doesn\u2019t know, but I think he does know. Of course he wouldn\u2019t have burned down King\u2019s Landing. He doesn\u2019t trust Tyrion, though, and won\u2019t speak openly with him. But I think the biggest reason is Doylist: they wanted\u00a0Tyrion to spell out for the audience that, even when Dany punished bad men, she did it in horrible ways and that it all contributed to her getting a very skewed view of justice. It\u2019s weak writing, but they needed to make a point\u2013and they needed to show us the difference between Jon and Dany.</p><blockquote><p><i><b>Tyrion</b>: \u201cEverywhere she goes, evil men die and we cheer her for it.\nAnd she grows more powerful and more sure that she is good and right.\nShe believes her destiny is to build a better world for everyone.\nIf you believed that if you truly believed it, wouldn\u2019t you kill whoever stood between you and paradise?\u201c</i></p></blockquote><p>Here\u2019s the thing: Tyrion explains to us\u2013and to Jon\u2013that <b>Dany killed (without a trial) men who\u2019d done awful things (slavers). </b>He explains to us\u2013and to Jon\u2013that <b>Dany killed men <i>before</i> they did awful things (the khals). And isn\u2019t that exactly what Tyrion now wants Jon to do?\u00a0</b></p><h2><i><b>Isn\u2019t that what Jon has been wrestling with the whole episode so far? (And will keep wrestling with.)</b></i></h2><p>He needs to stop Dany. But he probably can\u2019t defeat her in a way that leads to a trial. He can\u2019t kill her in an honorable way or even have someone else do it with a hanging or a beheading. <b>He\u2019ll need to assassinate her. So, again, what does that make him? How is he better than she is?</b>\u00a0</p><h2>Yes, he\u2019d be doing it for the greater good, but isn\u2019t that what she believes she has done so far?</h2><p>So how does that make Jon better?</p><p>Perhaps Jon <i>was</i> determined to kill Dany earlier, but now, by trying to encourage Jon to do it, Tyrion actually gives Jon doubts. Which isn\u2019t that odd. Jon could\u2019ve let his rage carry him, but now Tyrion invites him to actually examine the action long before Jon can go through with it.\u00a0</p><p>But Tyrion\u2013who\u2019s in love with Dany\u2013doesn\u2019t understand why Jon hesitates. He thinks Jon is loyal and in love, but <b>when Tyrion says,\u00a0<i>\u201cI know you love her,\u201d </i>Jon looks annoyed. </b>Even angry. Provoked.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"353\" data-orig-height=\"236\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b2ca135d442bc0c8021caa9d1ececc57/tumblr_inline_ps4bzy7Eyp1upc2qw_1280.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"353\" data-orig-height=\"236\"/></figure><p>We\u2019ve seen this reaction of his before.

I bet a huge part of him wants to scream,\u00a0\u201c<i><b>I DON\u2019T!\u201d </b></i>But he can\u2019t. Because he doesn\u2019t trust Tyrion and he\u2019s been keeping this secret for so long that telling it now, in this situation and to this man, would be the dumbest thing he could do.</p><p>I really do think that Jon\u2019s biggest struggle here is that he doesn\u2019t want to assassinate an essentially defenseless woman (because without her dragon and her armies, she is). A woman he\u2019s related to, a woman who loves him, a woman he\u2019s been manipulating for a long while. <b>Dany is abusive toward him, but the world he lives in is completely unaware of that being a thing. In the world he lives in, killing a woman in cold blood is dishonorable and evil. It\u2019s against his moral code.</b></p><p>He\u2019s also pledged himself to her (duty) and now he\u2019s facing having to kill her to protect his family (love). Love is the death of duty, he says, because he and Tyrion are having somewhat different conversations since Jon doesn\u2019t tell Tyrion the truth. So Tyrion (and we) keep thinking Jon\u2019s romantic feelings for Dany is clashing with his sense telling him she needs to be stopped, when I think Jon\u2019s having a big ass identity crisis. Not just an identity crisis because of his Targaryen blood, but also about <b>who he\u2019ll be if he kills Dany the way he knows he must. Not on a battlefield but in a quiet, possibly even intimate moment. It\u2019s the only way he can get close enough.</b></p><p>Then Tyrion speaks a bit more plainly.</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cIt\u2019s a terrible thing I\u2019m asking.\nIt\u2019s also the right thing.\nDo you think I\u2019m the last man she\u2019ll execute? Who is more dangerous than the rightful heir to the Iron Throne?\u201c</i></p></blockquote><p><b>There\u2019s a huge shift in Jon\u2019s demeanor here.

But Jon\u00a0<i>has</i> to slip back into this role. This isn\u2019t whipped!Jon. This is <i>terrified</i> Jon.<b> Tyrion\u2019s\u00a0asking Jon to commit treason. A word that\u2019s kept popping up this season\u2013and Jon made it clear how much it frightened him as early as in 8.01.</b></p><p>Outside wait guards who (as they established in 8.05) speak the Common Tongue. They could be listening in on every word they say. And even if they don\u2019t overhear, what if Tyrion is playing the game? Jon doesn\u2019t trust him. Tyrion lured him into a trap. He ratted out his best friend. He put Sansa at risk. He stood by Dany\u2019s side as she invaded Westeros. What if he tells on Jon too? Just to save himself. I think Jon does like Tyrion but <i>trust</i>? No.</p><h2>If Dany in any way suspects that Jon isn\u2019t loyal to her, she\u2019ll jump aboard that dragon of hers and burn down Winterfell. Jon can\u2019t risk setting her off.</h2><p><b>Compare this to Jon\u2019s reaction when Arya said the same. It\u2019s not similar in the slightest</b>. With Arya, we saw the real Jon. Here, we don\u2019t. We see the Jon most of s8 has given us: Dany\u2019s obedient servant. The Jon who shuts Sansa up in a meeting because that\u2019s the only way he thinks he can be the shield between Dany and the people he loves.\u00a0</p><p>After this Jon tries leaving the room. This is getting too dangerous. But Tyrion doesn\u2019t understand Jon. Tyrion still thinks he needs to convince Jon that Dany is dangerous, so he pulls the family card.</p><blockquote><p><i><b>T: </b>\u201cAnd your sisters? Do you see them bending the knee?\u201d<br/><br/><b>J:</b> \u201cMy sisters will be loyal to the throne.\u201d</i></p><p><i><b>T:</b> \u201cWhy do you think Sansa told me the truth about you? Because she doesn\u2019t want Dany to be queen.\u201d</i></p><p><i><b>J: </b>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t get to choose.\u201d</i></p><p><i><b>T: </b>\u201cNo.\nBut you do.\u201d</i><br/></p></blockquote><p>\n\nAgain: compare this to Jon\u2019s behavior with Arya. He said nothing of the sort because he didn\u2019t have to protect Sansa with lies when talking to Arya. This is Jon terrified of saying the wrong thing. <b>This is \u201cI\u2019m loyal to my beloved Joffrey\u201d Jon</b>. And, yes, it\u2019s bad writing. It is. They\u2019re <i>straining</i> to keep up the ruse up until the last minute. They don\u2019t want us to think that Jon is walking into the throne room determined to kill Dany. Even though Jon looked ready to assassinate her or at least betray her in some way earlier in the episode\u2013or perhaps <i>because</i> he did\u2013they now need to make us doubt that he\u2019d ever go against her. And they needed to get in the line,\u00a0<i><b>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t get to choose,</b></i>\u201d so that Dany\u2019s line later,\u00a0<i><b>\u201cThey don\u2019t get to choose,\u201d</b></i> makes it clear why Jon finally takes the plunge.<br/></p><p><b>Sansa was always supposed to be the final trigger.</b> But instead of making that explicit throughout the season (most likely because then it wouldn\u2019t be as surprising), they did this.</p><p><b>When Jon stalks toward the throne room, I do think he\u2019s already more or less made up his mind.</b> He probably made it up earlier that day. But I also think he struggles with the decision because he thinks that, if he does it, he won\u2019t make it out alive. He\u2019ll never see his family again. He might even start a war between the Unsullied/Dothraki and the Northmen and KotV waiting outside the city gates. He knows it\u2019s a dishonorable act. <b>He knows Ned Stark would\u2019ve found another way.</b>\u00a0</p><p>Jon\u2019s behavior once in the throne room is almost like the different stages of grief: <i><b>denial, anger, bargaining, depression, acceptance.</b></i>\u00a0(And, again, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s because he loves her; it\u2019s because of what he has to do and what it makes him.) Previously, even though he\u2019s probably always known deep down that one day it would come to this, he\u2019s been in denial. <b>He\u2019s done his very best to take the easy way out, to not confront, to hope he can keep mollifying her, but now he walks in angry.</b></p><p>While she\u2019s gushing about the Iron Throne as if she didn\u2019t just slaughtered a few hundred thousand people or so,<b> Jon confronts her </b>for the first time since\u2026 7.04? Possibly 7.05 when he questioned her using Drogon on the battlefield. And<b> I don\u2019t think Jon would\u2019ve done that if he believed Dany would leave that room alive.</b> It\u2019s much too dangerous. He\u2019s avoided confronting her thus far for a reason.</p><p>And, remember, he <i>just</i> defended this act of hers to Tyrion. But now they\u2019re letting us see how Jon really feels.</p><blockquote><p><i><b>J:</b> \u201cI saw them executing Lannister prisoners in the street.\nThey said they were acting on your orders.\u201d</i></p><p><i><b>D: </b>\u201cIt was necessary.\u201d</i></p><p><i><b>J:</b> \u201cNecessary? Have you been down there? Have you seen? Children, little children, burned!\u201d</i></p><p><i><b>D: </b>\u201cI tried to make peace with Cersei.\nShe used their innocence as a weapon against me.\nShe thought it would cripple me.\u201d</i></p></blockquote><p>A terrifying thing to say. It <i>should\u2019ve</i> stayed Dany\u2019s hand. And Jon knows it\u2019s useless to argue, so he moves on and<b> it leads to bargaining.</b></p><blockquote><p><i><b>J:</b> \u201cAnd Tyrion?\u201d</i></p><p><i><b>D: </b>\u201cHe conspired behind my back with my enemies.\nHow have you treated people who\u2019ve done the same to you, even when it broke your heart?\u201d</i></p><p><i><b>J:</b> \u201cForgive him.\u201d</i></p><p><i><b>D:</b> \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</i></p><p><i><b>J:</b> \u201cYou can.\nYou can forgive all of them, make them see they made a mistake.\nMake them understand.\nPlease, Dany.\u201d</i><br/></p></blockquote><p>What I think Jon is pleading for here isn\u2019t that Dany forgives everyone. I think Jon\u2019s desperately pleading for her to give him a reason to not go through with what he came to the throne room to do. He doesn\u2019t want to kill her. He doesn\u2019t. And especially not this way. It\u2019s so easy for us to sit at home and judge and say <i>KILL HER KILL HER</i>. I sure as hell have said it. But would we be able to do it? In self-defense, maybe, but just walk up to her and stab her in the heart? I\u2019m not sure I could\u2019ve done it.<br/></p><p><b>Yes, Jon has killed people before but only men. Women he\u2019s <i>avoided</i> killing. </b>Even when he banished Melisandre, he said that if she were to return to the North, he\u2019d have her hanged as a murdered. <i>Have</i> her hanged = he wouldn\u2019t do it himself. He couldn\u2019t kill Ygritte. And this is complicated too. Dany is his blood. She is his family, in a way. And so the pleading goes on until we land here:</p><blockquote><p><i><b>D:</b> \u201cIt\u2019s not easy to see something that\u2019s never been before: a good world.\u201d</i></p><p><i><b>J: </b>\u201cHow do you know? How do you know it\u2019ll be good?\u201d</i></p><p><i><b>D:</b> \u201cBecause I know what is good.\nAnd so do you.\u201d</i></p><p><i><b>J:</b>\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d</i><br/></p></blockquote><p>\u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d he says because he\u2019s thinking of what he has to do. <b>He doesn\u2019t know whether killing Dany in cold blood, in this moment where she\u2019s happy and not putting anyone in immediate danger or hurting anyone, would be a good act.</b> It might be necessary. Tyrion certainly seems to think so. But, again, isn\u2019t that the excuse Dany uses? What would Ned Stark do? Would he find a better solution? A good solution. A fair and just (albeit riskier) solution. He would have, wouldn\u2019t he?</p><p>Jon\u2019s crying and lost. The depression stage. Where he should\u2019ve received comfort, but instead Dany as always tries manipulating him into agreeing with her. She\u2019s touching him\u2013a hand on his chest, a hand on his shoulder\u2013while he stands there passive. Struggling. Wrapping his head around what to do. On how to justify it to himself. <b>He needs a trigger.</b> And she gives him one \u2013 <i><b>\u201cThey don\u2019t get to choose.\u201d</b></i> \u2013 and you see the moment he realizes that he has to do it.\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"400\" data-orig-height=\"201\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e2ac16a3a2188125dfa94ff04dbcfae8/tumblr_inline_ps4n1pfh5X1upc2qw_1280.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"400\" data-orig-height=\"201\"/></figure><p>There is no reasoning with her. He can\u2019t control her with soft manipulation anymore. <b>Burning down King\u2019s Landing didn\u2019t horrify her; it encouraged her. </b>Every time she doles out her own brand of justice, it makes her more sure she\u2019s right and good. Just like Tyrion said.</p><p>I think Jon knows now\u2013that he <i><b>accepts</b></i> now\u2013what he has to do. He\u2019s not Ned Stark\u2019s son. He\u2019s not honorable. But he is the shield that guards the realms of men. And he is the man who\u2019d kill to protect his family.\u00a0</p><p>\n\nDrogon is close by. They had a staring match before Jon entered the throne room. Jon has ridden Rhaegal. He knows about the bond, how a dragon can follow its rider\u2019s unspoken commands. <b>The moment Dany suspects something\u2019s wrong, Drogon will act. She can\u2019t suspect anything\u2019s wrong.</b><br/></p><p>So Jon lets her move in close. He lets her take his hand and put it on her cheek. When she asks him to break the wheel with her\u2013basically a proposal\u2013he gives her the only words he can. Not a yes. <b>Not\u00a0\u201c<i>I love you</i>\u201d because he doesn\u2019t.

He stands completely still and lets it happen. And <b>right before her lips touch his, his hand moves for the dagger.</b></p><hr><p>I don\u2019t like these writing choices, to be clear. They\u2019re awful. It\u2019s obvious that D&amp;D wanted us to keep guessing up until Jon\u2019s hand moved to his dagger. I\u2019d read the leaks so I knew, but imagine if you hadn\u2019t.<b> I watched a reaction video the other day and people had a strong, negative reaction when they thought Jon said yes to Dany\u2019s proposal\u2013and then they <i>cheered</i> when he stabbed her.</b>\u00a0A room full of people who previously had cheered Dany on when she burned the Lannister army now cheered when Jon murdered her. This is what D&amp;D wanted and so Jon\u2019s characterization had to suffer. They decided to write a scene where he had to murder her while kissing her and <b><i>it\u2019s gross as hell.</i></b> But this was the best way they knew how to shock us.</p><h2>They also needed to show us that Jon is the opposite of Dany.\u00a0They\u2019ve been foils the whole series and with Tyrion\u2019s comments earlier and Jon\u2019s hesitation now, they\u2019re making it clear once and for all: Dany would\u2019ve done it. If she believed Jon was an evil man, she would\u2019ve murdered him without hesitation and without regret.\u00a0<b>She kills and kills and kills and never questions the decision</b>. It\u2019s righteous. It\u2019s just. <i>It\u2019s <b>necessary</b>.</i></h2><p><b>So Jon<i> has to </i>question it. </b>Jon\u2019s instinct has to be to find a way out of it. To find a more peaceful solution, like his real father Ned Stark would\u2019ve done. Because Jon isn\u2019t fire and blood. He\u2019s not Dany or Aerys.</p><p>And he has to be torn up about it too. He has to stare at her in shock, he has to cry, he has to ask Tyrion much later whether what they did was the right thing to do. He can\u2019t be like Littlefinger who happily flings Lysa out the Moon Door after telling her the truth about his feelings. Jon\u2019s our hero not a villain.</p><p>And yet Jon killed a woman. A\u00a0woman he was related to, who loved him, who wanted him by her side, who believed he loved her back when he only ever used her, who lost so much <i>because</i> he used her, who chose fear because he couldn\u2019t love her\u2026\u00a0\u00a0\n\n(No, I don\u2019t think either is Jon\u2019s fault, but I\u2019m not so sure he would agree with me.)\n\n</p><h2>So\u00a0by murdering her this way, not in the heat of battle, not to stop her from actively hurting someone, not even by executing her after a fair trial, but as a <i><b>precautionary measure</b></i>, what does that make him?</h2><h2><b>A hero or a monster?</b></h2><p>It\u2019s an excellent question. Something that warrants a lot of discussion about ethics and morals. Something that could\u2019ve made this episode very interesting had D&amp;D actually had the guts to explore it.<b> If they had let Jon speak openly with someone and confess that he didn\u2019t love Dany, open up about his feelings and thoughts, this could\u2019ve changed the whole season.</b></p><p>But <b>instead they chose the very bloody version of will they/won\u2019t they.</b> They wanted us to be unsure of whether Jon would give in to the love they\u2019ve tried to sell us (but Jon doesn\u2019t actually feel) and rule by her side, or whether he would go against his own moral code and murder a woman. And now that I\u2019ve seen the whole season, I can\u2019t help but think that\u2019s the main reason why Jnerys even existed in the first place. To make this murder into a really gross and horrible twist.</p><p>I know everyone and their gerbil tell us Jon loves Dany, that she\u2019s the love of his life, that they\u2019re star-crossed lovers and what have you. But I never saw him fall in love. I never saw him be happy with her (while I saw him being happy with everyone else). I only saw fear and annoyance and anger and obedience and playing a role. The cast telling me Jon loved her is not enough to change that. Tyrion thinking Jon loved Dany is not enough to change that.\n\nJon crying over her dead body is not enough to change that. Isolated, that scene could\u2019ve looked as if he loved her, but looking at this whole episode\u2026? Looking at all of s8 and s7? It just does not make sense to me.\u00a0</p><p>I don\u2019t know whether they filmed different versions of the assassination scene. I don\u2019t know whether they retconned it late in the process and asked for reshoots and did the best they could with the editing. I don\u2019t know whether they always wanted to keep it ambiguous. I don\u2019t even know whether they went for starcrossed lovers and just failed <i>epically</i>. All of them. Except Ramin Djawadi lmao. All I know is that<b> I never saw Jon loving Dany and so I can\u2019t believe it.</b></p><p>So this is my take. This is how I make sense of Jon\u2019s characterization, which seemingly only ever existed because of a twist. As infuriating as that is.</p><p>Thanks for the ask!</p>",

If Jon really truly followed Dany, he would keep fighting too. But his morals stop him. He sheathes his sword and tries getting everyone out of the city.</p><p>Then 8.06 starts. We follow Tyrion (with Jon and Davos close behind) walking back into King\u2019s Landing on a street littered with corpses and ashes and crumbled buildings.<b> They stop at the charred remains of the mother and child Arya tried to help.</b> The little girl still holding her toy horse. Tyrion tells Jon he\u2019ll find him later to which Jon replies,\u00a0\u201c<b><i>It\u2019s not safe. Let me send some men with you.</i>\u201d</b></p><p>Why isn\u2019t it safe? We don\u2019t know whether Tyrion has told Jon about Jaime, but it\u2019s most likely common knowledge by now and Tyrion did include Davos in his betrayal. It was from Davos Tyrion asked the favor to help in smuggling Cersei and Jaime to Pentos. <b>We don\u2019t <i>need</i> to see Davos and Tyrion telling Jon.

Jon\u2019s not afraid that a King\u2019s Landing survivor will attack Tyrion; <b>Jon is afraid of what Dany will do if she gets her hands on Tyrion</b>. <b>And</b> <b>Jon sending men with Tyrion to protect him is <i>also</i> defying Dany.</b></p><p>After this, Jon interrupts Grey Worm while the latter sentences prisoners of war to die in the name of his queen.

He glances at the prisoners, deliberating, looks back at GW. He doesn\u2019t want to let GW kill them, but he also knows that if he and his men engage in a battle against the Unsullied, Jon puts even more people at risk. Especially his family, who\u2019ll suffer if Dany learns that Jon fought her men. So he makes his decision and walks away.</p><p>As he walks through the square, surrounded by Dothraki,<b> low and dark music drones ominously in the background. Jon looks hard</b>.

There\u2019s even a hint of an incredulous amusement, as if <b>he thinks Tyrion is a god damn hypocrite and he can\u2019t believe the words coming out of the guy\u2019s mouth.</b></p><p>Jon seems to think,\u00a0<b>\u201c<i>If you knew all along what she is, then why the hell did you help her in invading Westeros? Why did you snitch on Varys when Varys was trying to </i>stop<i> her?</i>\u201d</b> And it\u2019s easy for Jon to judge. He got involved with Dany because death was coming and he believed he needed her dragons and her armies to stop it. He did what he had to to save everyone he loves and, you know, the world. And he\u2019s stayed by Dany\u2019s side because he needed to protect his family from her. What was Tyrion\u2019s excuse?<br></p><p><b>Then comes the complete switch in Jon\u2019s attitude. </b>The switch that you, anon, brought up: Tyrion makes this about House words. He makes it about <i><b>blood</b></i>.</p><blockquote><p><i><b>T:\u00a0</b>\u201cOur queen\u2019s nature is fire and blood\u2013\u201d</i></p><p><i><b>J:\u00a0</b>\u201cYou think our house words are stamped on our bodies when we\u2019re born and that\u2019s who we are? Then I\u2019d be fire and blood too.\u201c</i></p></blockquote><h2><b><i>\u201cThen I\u2019d be fire and blood too.\u201d</i></b></h2><p>Finally, Jon\u2019s identity crisis is addressed: he\u2019s triggered by the suggestion that he and Dany could be the same.</p><p>Unfortunately, this is not just way too damn late. It\u2019s also badly written because it\u2019s so very contrived.</p><p><b>I think this scene mostly exists for two reasons:</b> they needed someone to explain to the audience why assassinating Dany was justified, to point out that this is her pattern, and make sure we all knew that she needed to be stopped. Which is hamfisted and insulting to the audience\u2019s intelligence. But they also wanted to <i>actually</i> insult their audience by pointing out that those of us who\u2019ve cheered Dany on were part of the problem. We\u2019ve accepted her horrible deeds without questioning. We\u2019ve cheered her on and she\u2019s grown stronger and stronger as an icon until she became the face of this show. They\u2019re basically slapping their audience in the face for drinking the koolaid they gave us.<br></p><h2>But they\u2019re also asking a rather interesting question that, in better hands, could\u2019ve made this scene very compelling: if it were you, <b>if you were the one with almost unlimited power, would you be any better?</b></h2><p>If you could round up really bad criminals and burn them alive without repercussions, would you do it? Would you do it even if you weren\u2019t 100% sure everyone was guilty? If someone told you 9 out of 10 were guilty of human trafficking but that one was innocent and you couldn\u2019t know whom, would you still do it? Would you think that sacrificing one person to make the world a better place would be worth it?</p><p>Daenerys thinks so. She would sacrifice thousands. Possibly even millions. But would you? Would Jon? Another\u00a0Targaryen who has ridden dragons and who has an inner beast that appears every so often. When he killed Janos Slynt, when he beat Ramsay to a pulp, when he throttled Littlefinger.</p><p><b>Jon is a hot-headed guy and a killer and a Targaryen.</b> And now he\u2019s facing a very important question:\u00a0<b>If Dany is a monster because she\u2019s fire and blood, then what does that make Jon? </b>If Dany is her father, then what does that make Jon?</p><p>His biological father was hardly an admirable man. He abandoned his wife and children for a teenager to fulfill a prophecy, something Jon would never ever do. And yet he has spent the last few weeks lying to his family while banging a woman he doesn\u2019t love just to get her dragons. Something Ned Stark would\u00a0<i>never</i>\u00a0do, but perhaps Rhaegar would.</p><p>\n\nWhen Jon defends Dany by giving weak excuses, he\u2019s not actually defending Dany. He\u2019s doing his best not to examine or even acknowledge his identity crisis, because that would mean examining himself and the things he\u2019s done he\u2019s not proud of<b>. He\u2019d have to wonder: is this the Targaryen in me?</b></p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cI\u2019m tired of fighting.\nIt\u2019s all I\u2019ve done since I left home.\nI\u2019ve killed brothers of the Night\u2019s Watch.\nI\u2019ve killed wildlings.\nI\u2019ve killed men that I admire.\nI hanged a boy younger than Bran.\u201c</i></p></blockquote><p>And he\u2019s killed on the battlefield. He\u2019s most likely lost count of how many men he\u2019s killed by now. And he knows well how rage can take over, how blood lust can take over until you\u2019re completely lost. The way he just saw his men lose it when they started attacking anything that moved despite the bells sounding out surrender.</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201c<b>Aye, it\u2019s easy to judge when you\u2019re standing far from the battlefield.</b>\u201c<br></i></p></blockquote><h2>Then Tyrion says something that catches Jon off guard completely. The thing Jon doesn\u2019t want to ask himself:\u00a0<b>\u201d<i>Would you have done it?</i>\u201d<br></b></h2><p>Jon is taken aback at first. Then he claims he doesn\u2019t know, but I think he does know. Of course he wouldn\u2019t have burned down King\u2019s Landing. He doesn\u2019t trust Tyrion, though, and won\u2019t speak openly with him. But I think the biggest reason is Doylist: they wanted\u00a0Tyrion to spell out for the audience that, even when Dany punished bad men, she did it in horrible ways and that it all contributed to her getting a very skewed view of justice. It\u2019s weak writing, but they needed to make a point\u2013and they needed to show us the difference between Jon and Dany.</p><blockquote><p><i><b>Tyrion</b>: \u201cEverywhere she goes, evil men die and we cheer her for it.\nAnd she grows more powerful and more sure that she is good and right.\nShe believes her destiny is to build a better world for everyone.\nIf you believed that if you truly believed it, wouldn\u2019t you kill whoever stood between you and paradise?\u201c</i></p></blockquote><p>Here\u2019s the thing: Tyrion explains to us\u2013and to Jon\u2013that <b>Dany killed (without a trial) men who\u2019d done awful things (slavers). </b>He explains to us\u2013and to Jon\u2013that <b>Dany killed men <i>before</i> they did awful things (the khals). And isn\u2019t that exactly what Tyrion now wants Jon to do?\u00a0</b></p><h2><i><b>Isn\u2019t that what Jon has been wrestling with the whole episode so far? (And will keep wrestling with.)</b></i></h2><p>He needs to stop Dany. But he probably can\u2019t defeat her in a way that leads to a trial. He can\u2019t kill her in an honorable way or even have someone else do it with a hanging or a beheading. <b>He\u2019ll need to assassinate her. So, again, what does that make him? How is he better than she is?</b>\u00a0</p><h2>Yes, he\u2019d be doing it for the greater good, but isn\u2019t that what she believes she has done so far?</h2><p>So how does that make Jon better?</p><p>Perhaps Jon <i>was</i> determined to kill Dany earlier, but now, by trying to encourage Jon to do it, Tyrion actually gives Jon doubts. Which isn\u2019t that odd. Jon could\u2019ve let his rage carry him, but now Tyrion invites him to actually examine the action long before Jon can go through with it.\u00a0</p><p>But Tyrion\u2013who\u2019s in love with Dany\u2013doesn\u2019t understand why Jon hesitates. He thinks Jon is loyal and in love, but <b>when Tyrion says,\u00a0<i>\u201cI know you love her,\u201d </i>Jon looks annoyed. </b>Even angry. Provoked.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"353\" data-orig-height=\"236\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b2ca135d442bc0c8021caa9d1ececc57/tumblr_inline_ps4bzy7Eyp1upc2qw_1280.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"353\" data-orig-height=\"236\"></figure><p>We\u2019ve seen this reaction of his before. Many times.

I bet a huge part of him wants to scream,\u00a0\u201c<i><b>I DON\u2019T!\u201d </b></i>But he can\u2019t. Because he doesn\u2019t trust Tyrion and he\u2019s been keeping this secret for so long that telling it now, in this situation and to this man, would be the dumbest thing he could do.</p><p>I really do think that Jon\u2019s biggest struggle here is that he doesn\u2019t want to assassinate an essentially defenseless woman (because without her dragon and her armies, she is). A woman he\u2019s related to, a woman who loves him, a woman he\u2019s been manipulating for a long while. <b>Dany is abusive toward him, but the world he lives in is completely unaware of that being a thing. In the world he lives in, killing a woman in cold blood is dishonorable and evil. It\u2019s against his moral code.</b></p><p>He\u2019s also pledged himself to her (duty) and now he\u2019s facing having to kill her to protect his family (love). Love is the death of duty, he says, because he and Tyrion are having somewhat different conversations since Jon doesn\u2019t tell Tyrion the truth. So Tyrion (and we) keep thinking Jon\u2019s romantic feelings for Dany is clashing with his sense telling him she needs to be stopped, when I think Jon\u2019s having a big ass identity crisis. Not just an identity crisis because of his Targaryen blood, but also about <b>who he\u2019ll be if he kills Dany the way he knows he must. Not on a battlefield but in a quiet, possibly even intimate moment. It\u2019s the only way he can get close enough.</b></p><p>Then Tyrion speaks a bit more plainly.</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cIt\u2019s a terrible thing I\u2019m asking.\nIt\u2019s also the right thing.\nDo you think I\u2019m the last man she\u2019ll execute? Who is more dangerous than the rightful heir to the Iron Throne?\u201c</i></p></blockquote><p><b>There\u2019s a huge shift in Jon\u2019s demeanor here.

A word that\u2019s kept popping up this season\u2013and Jon made it clear how much it frightened him as early as in 8.01.</b></p><p>Outside wait guards who (as they established in 8.05) speak the Common Tongue. They could be listening in on every word they say. And even if they don\u2019t overhear, what if Tyrion is playing the game? Jon doesn\u2019t trust him. Tyrion lured him into a trap. He ratted out his best friend. He put Sansa at risk. He stood by Dany\u2019s side as she invaded Westeros. What if he tells on Jon too? Just to save himself. I think Jon does like Tyrion but <i>trust</i>? No.</p><h2>If Dany in any way suspects that Jon isn\u2019t loyal to her, she\u2019ll jump aboard that dragon of hers and burn down Winterfell. Jon can\u2019t risk setting her off.</h2><p><b>Compare this to Jon\u2019s reaction when Arya said the same. It\u2019s not similar in the slightest</b>. With Arya, we saw the real Jon. Here, we don\u2019t. We see the Jon most of s8 has given us: Dany\u2019s obedient servant. The Jon who shuts Sansa up in a meeting because that\u2019s the only way he thinks he can be the shield between Dany and the people he loves.\u00a0</p><p>After this Jon tries leaving the room. This is getting too dangerous. But Tyrion doesn\u2019t understand Jon. Tyrion still thinks he needs to convince Jon that Dany is dangerous, so he pulls the family card.</p><blockquote><p><i><b>T: </b>\u201cAnd your sisters? Do you see them bending the knee?\u201d<br><br><b>J:</b> \u201cMy sisters will be loyal to the throne.\u201d</i></p><p><i><b>T:</b> \u201cWhy do you think Sansa told me the truth about you? Because she doesn\u2019t want Dany to be queen.\u201d</i></p><p><i><b>J: </b>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t get to choose.\u201d</i></p><p><i><b>T: </b>\u201cNo.\nBut you do.\u201d</i><br></p></blockquote><p>\n\nAgain: compare this to Jon\u2019s behavior with Arya. He said nothing of the sort because he didn\u2019t have to protect Sansa with lies when talking to Arya. This is Jon terrified of saying the wrong thing. <b>This is \u201cI\u2019m loyal to my beloved Joffrey\u201d Jon</b>. And, yes, it\u2019s bad writing. It is. They\u2019re <i>straining</i> to keep up the ruse up until the last minute. They don\u2019t want us to think that Jon is walking into the throne room determined to kill Dany. Even though Jon looked ready to assassinate her or at least betray her in some way earlier in the episode\u2013or perhaps <i>because</i> he did\u2013they now need to make us doubt that he\u2019d ever go against her. And they needed to get in the line,\u00a0<i><b>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t get to choose,</b></i>\u201d so that Dany\u2019s line later,\u00a0<i><b>\u201cThey don\u2019t get to choose,\u201d</b></i> makes it clear why Jon finally takes the plunge.<br></p><p><b>Sansa was always supposed to be the final trigger.</b> But instead of making that explicit throughout the season (most likely because then it wouldn\u2019t be as surprising), they did this.</p><p><b>When Jon stalks toward the throne room, I do think he\u2019s already more or less made up his mind.</b> He probably made it up earlier that day. But I also think he struggles with the decision because he thinks that, if he does it, he won\u2019t make it out alive. He\u2019ll never see his family again. He might even start a war between the Unsullied/Dothraki and the Northmen and KotV waiting outside the city gates. He knows it\u2019s a dishonorable act. <b>He knows Ned Stark would\u2019ve found another way.</b>\u00a0</p><p>Jon\u2019s behavior once in the throne room is almost like the different stages of grief: <i><b>denial, anger, bargaining, depression, acceptance.</b></i>\u00a0(And, again, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s because he loves her; it\u2019s because of what he has to do and what it makes him.) Previously, even though he\u2019s probably always known deep down that one day it would come to this, he\u2019s been in denial. <b>He\u2019s done his very best to take the easy way out, to not confront, to hope he can keep mollifying her, but now he walks in angry.</b></p><p>While she\u2019s gushing about the Iron Throne as if she didn\u2019t just slaughtered a few hundred thousand people or so,<b> Jon confronts her </b>for the first time since\u2026 7.04? Possibly 7.05 when he questioned her using Drogon on the battlefield. And<b> I don\u2019t think Jon would\u2019ve done that if he believed Dany would leave that room alive.</b> It\u2019s much too dangerous. He\u2019s avoided confronting her thus far for a reason.</p><p>And, remember, he <i>just</i> defended this act of hers to Tyrion. But now they\u2019re letting us see how Jon really feels.</p><blockquote><p><i><b>J:</b> \u201cI saw them executing Lannister prisoners in the street.\nThey said they were acting on your orders.\u201d</i></p><p><i><b>D: </b>\u201cIt was necessary.\u201d</i></p><p><i><b>J:</b> \u201cNecessary? Have you been down there? Have you seen? Children, little children, burned!\u201d</i></p><p><i><b>D: </b>\u201cI tried to make peace with Cersei.\nShe used their innocence as a weapon against me.\nShe thought it would cripple me.\u201d</i></p></blockquote><p>A terrifying thing to say. It <i>should\u2019ve</i> stayed Dany\u2019s hand. And Jon knows it\u2019s useless to argue, so he moves on and<b> it leads to bargaining.</b></p><blockquote><p><i><b>J:</b> \u201cAnd Tyrion?\u201d</i></p><p><i><b>D: </b>\u201cHe conspired behind my back with my enemies.\nHow have you treated people who\u2019ve done the same to you, even when it broke your heart?\u201d</i></p><p><i><b>J:</b> \u201cForgive him.\u201d</i></p><p><i><b>D:</b> \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</i></p><p><i><b>J:</b> \u201cYou can.\nYou can forgive all of them, make them see they made a mistake.\nMake them understand.\nPlease, Dany.\u201d</i><br></p></blockquote><p>What I think Jon is pleading for here isn\u2019t that Dany forgives everyone. I think Jon\u2019s desperately pleading for her to give him a reason to not go through with what he came to the throne room to do. He doesn\u2019t want to kill her. He doesn\u2019t. And especially not this way. It\u2019s so easy for us to sit at home and judge and say <i>KILL HER KILL HER</i>. I sure as hell have said it. But would we be able to do it? In self-defense, maybe, but just walk up to her and stab her in the heart? I\u2019m not sure I could\u2019ve done it.<br></p><p><b>Yes, Jon has killed people before but only men. Women he\u2019s <i>avoided</i> killing. </b>Even when he banished Melisandre, he said that if she were to return to the North, he\u2019d have her hanged as a murdered. <i>Have</i> her hanged = he wouldn\u2019t do it himself. He couldn\u2019t kill Ygritte. And this is complicated too. Dany is his blood. She is his family, in a way. And so the pleading goes on until we land here:</p><blockquote><p><i><b>D:</b> \u201cIt\u2019s not easy to see something that\u2019s never been before: a good world.\u201d</i></p><p><i><b>J: </b>\u201cHow do you know? How do you know it\u2019ll be good?\u201d</i></p><p><i><b>D:</b> \u201cBecause I know what is good.\nAnd so do you.\u201d</i></p><p><i><b>J:</b>\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d</i><br></p></blockquote><p>\u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d he says because he\u2019s thinking of what he has to do. <b>He doesn\u2019t know whether killing Dany in cold blood, in this moment where she\u2019s happy and not putting anyone in immediate danger or hurting anyone, would be a good act.</b> It might be necessary. Tyrion certainly seems to think so. But, again, isn\u2019t that the excuse Dany uses? What would Ned Stark do? Would he find a better solution? A good solution. A fair and just (albeit riskier) solution. He would have, wouldn\u2019t he?</p><p>Jon\u2019s crying and lost. The depression stage. Where he should\u2019ve received comfort, but instead Dany as always tries manipulating him into agreeing with her. She\u2019s touching him\u2013a hand on his chest, a hand on his shoulder\u2013while he stands there passive. Struggling. Wrapping his head around what to do. On how to justify it to himself. <b>He needs a trigger.</b> And she gives him one \u2013 <i><b>\u201cThey don\u2019t get to choose.\u201d</b></i> \u2013 and you see the moment he realizes that he has to do it.\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"400\" data-orig-height=\"201\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e2ac16a3a2188125dfa94ff04dbcfae8/tumblr_inline_ps4n1pfh5X1upc2qw_1280.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"400\" data-orig-height=\"201\"></figure><p>There is no reasoning with her. He can\u2019t control her with soft manipulation anymore. <b>Burning down King\u2019s Landing didn\u2019t horrify her; it encouraged her. </b>Every time she doles out her own brand of justice, it makes her more sure she\u2019s right and good. Just like Tyrion said.</p><p>I think Jon knows now\u2013that he <i><b>accepts</b></i> now\u2013what he has to do. He\u2019s not Ned Stark\u2019s son. He\u2019s not honorable. But he is the shield that guards the realms of men. And he is the man who\u2019d kill to protect his family.\u00a0</p><p>\n\nDrogon is close by. They had a staring match before Jon entered the throne room. Jon has ridden Rhaegal. He knows about the bond, how a dragon can follow its rider\u2019s unspoken commands. <b>The moment Dany suspects something\u2019s wrong, Drogon will act. She can\u2019t suspect anything\u2019s wrong.</b><br></p><p>So Jon lets her move in close. He lets her take his hand and put it on her cheek. When she asks him to break the wheel with her\u2013basically a proposal\u2013he gives her the only words he can. Not a yes. <b>Not\u00a0\u201c<i>I love you</i>\u201d because he doesn\u2019t.

This is what D&amp;D wanted and so Jon\u2019s characterization had to suffer. They decided to write a scene where he had to murder her while kissing her and <b><i>it\u2019s gross as hell.</i></b> But this was the best way they knew how to shock us.</p><h2>They also needed to show us that Jon is the opposite of Dany.\u00a0They\u2019ve been foils the whole series and with Tyrion\u2019s comments earlier and Jon\u2019s hesitation now, they\u2019re making it clear once and for all: Dany would\u2019ve done it. If she believed Jon was an evil man, she would\u2019ve murdered him without hesitation and without regret.\u00a0<b>She kills and kills and kills and never questions the decision</b>. It\u2019s righteous. It\u2019s just. <i>It\u2019s <b>necessary</b>.</i></h2><p><b>So Jon<i> has to </i>question it. </b>Jon\u2019s instinct has to be to find a way out of it. To find a more peaceful solution, like his real father Ned Stark would\u2019ve done. Because Jon isn\u2019t fire and blood. He\u2019s not Dany or Aerys.</p><p>And he has to be torn up about it too. He has to stare at her in shock, he has to cry, he has to ask Tyrion much later whether what they did was the right thing to do. He can\u2019t be like Littlefinger who happily flings Lysa out the Moon Door after telling her the truth about his feelings. Jon\u2019s our hero not a villain.</p><p>And yet Jon killed a woman. A\u00a0woman he was related to, who loved him, who wanted him by her side, who believed he loved her back when he only ever used her, who lost so much <i>because</i> he used her, who chose fear because he couldn\u2019t love her\u2026\u00a0\u00a0\n\n(No, I don\u2019t think either is Jon\u2019s fault, but I\u2019m not so sure he would agree with me.)\n\n</p><h2>So\u00a0by murdering her this way, not in the heat of battle, not to stop her from actively hurting someone, not even by executing her after a fair trial, but as a <i><b>precautionary measure</b></i>, what does that make him?</h2><h2><b>A hero or a monster?</b></h2><p>It\u2019s an excellent question. Something that warrants a lot of discussion about ethics and morals. Something that could\u2019ve made this episode very interesting had D&amp;D actually had the guts to explore it.<b> If they had let Jon speak openly with someone and confess that he didn\u2019t love Dany, open up about his feelings and thoughts, this could\u2019ve changed the whole season.</b></p><p>But <b>instead they chose the very bloody version of will they/won\u2019t they.</b> They wanted us to be unsure of whether Jon would give in to the love they\u2019ve tried to sell us (but Jon doesn\u2019t actually feel) and rule by her side, or whether he would go against his own moral code and murder a woman. And now that I\u2019ve seen the whole season, I can\u2019t help but think that\u2019s the main reason why Jnerys even existed in the first place. To make this murder into a really gross and horrible twist.</p><p>I know everyone and their gerbil tell us Jon loves Dany, that she\u2019s the love of his life, that they\u2019re star-crossed lovers and what have you. But I never saw him fall in love. I never saw him be happy with her (while I saw him being happy with everyone else). I only saw fear and annoyance and anger and obedience and playing a role. The cast telling me Jon loved her is not enough to change that. Tyrion thinking Jon loved Dany is not enough to change that.\n\nJon crying over her dead body is not enough to change that. Isolated, that scene could\u2019ve looked as if he loved her, but looking at this whole episode\u2026? Looking at all of s8 and s7? It just does not make sense to me.\u00a0</p><p>I don\u2019t know whether they filmed different versions of the assassination scene. I don\u2019t know whether they retconned it late in the process and asked for reshoots and did the best they could with the editing. I don\u2019t know whether they always wanted to keep it ambiguous. I don\u2019t even know whether they went for starcrossed lovers and just failed <i>epically</i>. All of them. Except Ramin Djawadi lmao. All I know is that<b> I never saw Jon loving Dany and so I can\u2019t believe it.</b></p><p>So this is my take. This is how I make sense of Jon\u2019s characterization, which seemingly only ever existed because of a twist. As infuriating as that is.</p><p>Thanks for the ask!</p></p>",

Tyrion then asks about Sansa, similar to Varys with Ned in S1 (\u201clove is death of duty\u201d doesn\u2019t apply here either), which gives Jon pause. He chooses Sansa over Dany.

Like Ned, this was about love (Sansa) vs honor (killing his kin and Queen).\n\n</i><br></p></blockquote><hr><p>You\u2019ve hit the nail on the head, anon.</p><p>When I watched this episode, I was so disappointed that the leaks were true that I just watched on in exasperation and detachment. And even though I picked up on a few things (like the repeated mention of Sansa affecting Jon, and Jon\u2019s head shake at the claim he loves Dany), I still read the scene like most people did: Jon defended Dany which felt like a complete retcon from what happened in the previous episode and also felt very out of character for Jon.<br></p><p>I was so sick of the show that I didn\u2019t really want to dig deeper, but yesterday\u00a0I rewatched a few scenes and you\u2019re right. <b>Jon\u2019s defending himself</b>.</p><p>But let\u2019s rewind. I\u2019d like to go through the scenes before we reach the makeshift cell scene, because those scenes\u00a0<i>should</i> inform how we read Jon\u2019s interactions with Tyrion and Dany later. <b>Jon keeps <i>showing</i> us that he doesn\u2019t agree with her actions</b>, after all.</p><p>(<i>Oh, and this will be long, but it has visual aids. Yay?</i>)</p>[[MORE]]<p><b>In 8.05 Jon sort of goes against order</b>. Granted, Dany never commanded him to keep fighting, but she keeps fighting and Grey Worm keeps fighting. If Jon really truly followed Dany, he would keep fighting too. But his morals stop him. He sheathes his sword and tries getting everyone out of the city.</p><p>Then 8.06 starts. We follow Tyrion (with Jon and Davos close behind) walking back into King\u2019s Landing on a street littered with corpses and ashes and crumbled buildings.<b> They stop at the charred remains of the mother and child Arya tried to help.</b> The little girl still holding her toy horse. Tyrion tells Jon he\u2019ll find him later to which Jon replies,\u00a0\u201c<b><i>It\u2019s not safe. Let me send some men with you.</i>\u201d</b></p><p>Why isn\u2019t it safe? We don\u2019t know whether Tyrion has told Jon about Jaime, but it\u2019s most likely common knowledge by now and Tyrion did include Davos in his betrayal. It was from Davos Tyrion asked the favor to help in smuggling Cersei and Jaime to Pentos. <b>We don\u2019t <i>need</i> to see Davos and Tyrion telling Jon. It\u2019s implied that he knows.</b>\u00a0And when Tyrion tells Jon,\u00a0\u201c<i>I\u2019m going alone</i>,\u201d and Jon follows him with his eyes as Tyrion leaves, the look on Jon\u2019s face also implies he knows that Tyrion will try to find out whether his family made it out. Jon\u2019s not afraid that a King\u2019s Landing survivor will attack Tyrion; <b>Jon is afraid of what Dany will do if she gets her hands on Tyrion</b>. <b>And</b> <b>Jon sending men with Tyrion to protect him is <i>also</i> defying Dany.</b></p><p>After this, Jon interrupts Grey Worm while the latter sentences prisoners of war to die in the name of his queen. Both Jon and Davos argue for the prisoners to remain alive; however, GW has different orders.</p><blockquote><p><b>GW</b>: \u201cI obey my queen\u2019s commands, not yours.\u201d<br><b>Jon</b>: \u201cAnd what are the queen\u2019s commands?\u201d<br><b>GW</b>: \u201cKill all who follow Cersei Lannister.\u201d</p></blockquote><figure data-orig-width=\"380\" data-orig-height=\"205\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/4c90111dea10106888bd1153b46b8c23/tumblr_inline_ps42x0F4Ng1upc2qw_1280.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"380\" data-orig-height=\"205\"></figure><p><b>Jon physically stops Grey Worm from following these orders and\u00a0once more Jon defies Dany. </b>Everyone around them draws their weapons.

He glances at the prisoners, deliberating, looks back at GW. He doesn\u2019t want to let GW kill them, but he also knows that if he and his men engage in a battle against the Unsullied, Jon puts even more people at risk. Especially his family, who\u2019ll suffer if Dany learns that Jon fought her men. So he makes his decision and walks away.</p><p>As he walks through the square, surrounded by Dothraki,<b> low and dark music drones ominously in the background. Jon looks hard</b>.

He makes it about <i><b>blood</b></i>.</p><blockquote><p><i><b>T:\u00a0</b>\u201cOur queen\u2019s nature is fire and blood\u2013\u201d</i></p><p><i><b>J:\u00a0</b>\u201cYou think our house words are stamped on our bodies when we\u2019re born and that\u2019s who we are? Then I\u2019d be fire and blood too.\u201c</i></p></blockquote><h2><b><i>\u201cThen I\u2019d be fire and blood too.\u201d</i></b></h2><p>Finally, Jon\u2019s identity crisis is addressed: he\u2019s triggered by the suggestion that he and Dany could be the same.</p><p>Unfortunately, this is not just way too damn late. It\u2019s also badly written because it\u2019s so very contrived.</p><p><b>I think this scene mostly exists for two reasons:</b> they needed someone to explain to the audience why assassinating Dany was justified, to point out that this is her pattern, and make sure we all knew that she needed to be stopped. Which is hamfisted and insulting to the audience\u2019s intelligence. But they also wanted to <i>actually</i> insult their audience by pointing out that those of us who\u2019ve cheered Dany on were part of the problem. We\u2019ve accepted her horrible deeds without questioning. We\u2019ve cheered her on and she\u2019s grown stronger and stronger as an icon until she became the face of this show. They\u2019re basically slapping their audience in the face for drinking the koolaid they gave us.<br></p><h2>But they\u2019re also asking a rather interesting question that, in better hands, could\u2019ve made this scene very compelling: if it were you, <b>if you were the one with almost unlimited power, would you be any better?</b></h2><p>If you could round up really bad criminals and burn them alive without repercussions, would you do it? Would you do it even if you weren\u2019t 100% sure everyone was guilty? If someone told you 9 out of 10 were guilty of human trafficking but that one was innocent and you couldn\u2019t know whom, would you still do it? Would you think that sacrificing one person to make the world a better place would be worth it?</p><p>Daenerys thinks so. She would sacrifice thousands. Possibly even millions. But would you? Would Jon? Another\u00a0Targaryen who has ridden dragons and who has an inner beast that appears every so often. When he killed Janos Slynt, when he beat Ramsay to a pulp, when he throttled Littlefinger.</p><p><b>Jon is a hot-headed guy and a killer and a Targaryen.</b> And now he\u2019s facing a very important question:\u00a0<b>If Dany is a monster because she\u2019s fire and blood, then what does that make Jon? </b>If Dany is her father, then what does that make Jon?</p><p>His biological father was hardly an admirable man. He abandoned his wife and children for a teenager to fulfill a prophecy, something Jon would never ever do. And yet he has spent the last few weeks lying to his family while banging a woman he doesn\u2019t love just to get her dragons. Something Ned Stark would\u00a0<i>never</i>\u00a0do, but perhaps Rhaegar would.</p><p>\n\nWhen Jon defends Dany by giving weak excuses, he\u2019s not actually defending Dany. He\u2019s doing his best not to examine or even acknowledge his identity crisis, because that would mean examining himself and the things he\u2019s done he\u2019s not proud of<b>. He\u2019d have to wonder: is this the Targaryen in me?</b></p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cI\u2019m tired of fighting.\nIt\u2019s all I\u2019ve done since I left home.\nI\u2019ve killed brothers of the Night\u2019s Watch.\nI\u2019ve killed wildlings.\nI\u2019ve killed men that I admire.\nI hanged a boy younger than Bran.\u201c</i></p></blockquote><p>And he\u2019s killed on the battlefield. He\u2019s most likely lost count of how many men he\u2019s killed by now. And he knows well how rage can take over, how blood lust can take over until you\u2019re completely lost. The way he just saw his men lose it when they started attacking anything that moved despite the bells sounding out surrender.</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201c<b>Aye, it\u2019s easy to judge when you\u2019re standing far from the battlefield.</b>\u201c<br></i></p></blockquote><h2>Then Tyrion says something that catches Jon off guard completely. The thing Jon doesn\u2019t want to ask himself:\u00a0<b>\u201d<i>Would you have done it?</i>\u201d<br></b></h2><p>Jon is taken aback at first. Then he claims he doesn\u2019t know, but I think he does know. Of course he wouldn\u2019t have burned down King\u2019s Landing. He doesn\u2019t trust Tyrion, though, and won\u2019t speak openly with him. But I think the biggest reason is Doylist: they wanted\u00a0Tyrion to spell out for the audience that, even when Dany punished bad men, she did it in horrible ways and that it all contributed to her getting a very skewed view of justice. It\u2019s weak writing, but they needed to make a point\u2013and they needed to show us the difference between Jon and Dany.</p><blockquote><p><i><b>Tyrion</b>: \u201cEverywhere she goes, evil men die and we cheer her for it.\nAnd she grows more powerful and more sure that she is good and right.\nShe believes her destiny is to build a better world for everyone.\nIf you believed that if you truly believed it, wouldn\u2019t you kill whoever stood between you and paradise?\u201c</i></p></blockquote><p>Here\u2019s the thing: Tyrion explains to us\u2013and to Jon\u2013that <b>Dany killed (without a trial) men who\u2019d done awful things (slavers). </b>He explains to us\u2013and to Jon\u2013that <b>Dany killed men <i>before</i> they did awful things (the khals). And isn\u2019t that exactly what Tyrion now wants Jon to do?\u00a0</b></p><h2><i><b>Isn\u2019t that what Jon has been wrestling with the whole episode so far? (And will keep wrestling with.)</b></i></h2><p>He needs to stop Dany. But he probably can\u2019t defeat her in a way that leads to a trial. He can\u2019t kill her in an honorable way or even have someone else do it with a hanging or a beheading. <b>He\u2019ll need to assassinate her. So, again, what does that make him? How is he better than she is?</b>\u00a0</p><h2>Yes, he\u2019d be doing it for the greater good, but isn\u2019t that what she believes she has done so far?</h2><p>So how does that make Jon better?</p><p>Perhaps Jon <i>was</i> determined to kill Dany earlier, but now, by trying to encourage Jon to do it, Tyrion actually gives Jon doubts. Which isn\u2019t that odd. Jon could\u2019ve let his rage carry him, but now Tyrion invites him to actually examine the action long before Jon can go through with it.\u00a0</p><p>But Tyrion\u2013who\u2019s in love with Dany\u2013doesn\u2019t understand why Jon hesitates. He thinks Jon is loyal and in love, but <b>when Tyrion says,\u00a0<i>\u201cI know you love her,\u201d </i>Jon looks annoyed. </b>Even angry. Provoked.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"353\" data-orig-height=\"236\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b2ca135d442bc0c8021caa9d1ececc57/tumblr_inline_ps4bzy7Eyp1upc2qw_1280.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"353\" data-orig-height=\"236\"></figure><p>We\u2019ve seen this reaction of his before. Many times.

I bet a huge part of him wants to scream,\u00a0\u201c<i><b>I DON\u2019T!\u201d </b></i>But he can\u2019t. Because he doesn\u2019t trust Tyrion and he\u2019s been keeping this secret for so long that telling it now, in this situation and to this man, would be the dumbest thing he could do.</p><p>I really do think that Jon\u2019s biggest struggle here is that he doesn\u2019t want to assassinate an essentially defenseless woman (because without her dragon and her armies, she is). A woman he\u2019s related to, a woman who loves him, a woman he\u2019s been manipulating for a long while. <b>Dany is abusive toward him, but the world he lives in is completely unaware of that being a thing. In the world he lives in, killing a woman in cold blood is dishonorable and evil. It\u2019s against his moral code.</b></p><p>He\u2019s also pledged himself to her (duty) and now he\u2019s facing having to kill her to protect his family (love). Love is the death of duty, he says, because he and Tyrion are having somewhat different conversations since Jon doesn\u2019t tell Tyrion the truth. So Tyrion (and we) keep thinking Jon\u2019s romantic feelings for Dany is clashing with his sense telling him she needs to be stopped, when I think Jon\u2019s having a big ass identity crisis. Not just an identity crisis because of his Targaryen blood, but also about <b>who he\u2019ll be if he kills Dany the way he knows he must. Not on a battlefield but in a quiet, possibly even intimate moment. It\u2019s the only way he can get close enough.</b></p><p>Then Tyrion speaks a bit more plainly.</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cIt\u2019s a terrible thing I\u2019m asking.\nIt\u2019s also the right thing.\nDo you think I\u2019m the last man she\u2019ll execute? Who is more dangerous than the rightful heir to the Iron Throne?\u201c</i></p></blockquote><p><b>There\u2019s a huge shift in Jon\u2019s demeanor here.

But Jon\u00a0<i>has</i> to slip back into this role. This isn\u2019t whipped!Jon. This is <i>terrified</i> Jon.<b> Tyrion\u2019s\u00a0asking Jon to commit treason. A word that\u2019s kept popping up this season\u2013and Jon made it clear how much it frightened him as early as in 8.01.</b></p><p>Outside wait guards who (as they established in 8.05) speak the Common Tongue. They could be listening in on every word they say. And even if they don\u2019t overhear, what if Tyrion is playing the game? Jon doesn\u2019t trust him. Tyrion lured him into a trap. He ratted out his best friend. He put Sansa at risk. He stood by Dany\u2019s side as she invaded Westeros. What if he tells on Jon too? Just to save himself. I think Jon does like Tyrion but <i>trust</i>? No.</p><h2>If Dany in any way suspects that Jon isn\u2019t loyal to her, she\u2019ll jump aboard that dragon of hers and burn down Winterfell. Jon can\u2019t risk setting her off.</h2><p><b>Compare this to Jon\u2019s reaction when Arya said the same. It\u2019s not similar in the slightest</b>. With Arya, we saw the real Jon. Here, we don\u2019t. We see the Jon most of s8 has given us: Dany\u2019s obedient servant. The Jon who shuts Sansa up in a meeting because that\u2019s the only way he thinks he can be the shield between Dany and the people he loves.\u00a0</p><p>After this Jon tries leaving the room. This is getting too dangerous. But Tyrion doesn\u2019t understand Jon. Tyrion still thinks he needs to convince Jon that Dany is dangerous, so he pulls the family card.</p><blockquote><p><i><b>T: </b>\u201cAnd your sisters? Do you see them bending the knee?\u201d<br><br><b>J:</b> \u201cMy sisters will be loyal to the throne.\u201d</i></p><p><i><b>T:</b> \u201cWhy do you think Sansa told me the truth about you? Because she doesn\u2019t want Dany to be queen.\u201d</i></p><p><i><b>J: </b>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t get to choose.\u201d</i></p><p><i><b>T: </b>\u201cNo.\nBut you do.\u201d</i><br></p></blockquote><p>\n\nAgain: compare this to Jon\u2019s behavior with Arya. He said nothing of the sort because he didn\u2019t have to protect Sansa with lies when talking to Arya. This is Jon terrified of saying the wrong thing. <b>This is \u201cI\u2019m loyal to my beloved Joffrey\u201d Jon</b>. And, yes, it\u2019s bad writing. It is. They\u2019re <i>straining</i> to keep up the ruse up until the last minute. They don\u2019t want us to think that Jon is walking into the throne room determined to kill Dany. Even though Jon looked ready to assassinate her or at least betray her in some way earlier in the episode\u2013or perhaps <i>because</i> he did\u2013they now need to make us doubt that he\u2019d ever go against her. And they needed to get in the line,\u00a0<i><b>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t get to choose,</b></i>\u201d so that Dany\u2019s line later,\u00a0<i><b>\u201cThey don\u2019t get to choose,\u201d</b></i> makes it clear why Jon finally takes the plunge.<br></p><p><b>Sansa was always supposed to be the final trigger.</b> But instead of making that explicit throughout the season (most likely because then it wouldn\u2019t be as surprising), they did this.</p><p><b>When Jon stalks toward the throne room, I do think he\u2019s already more or less made up his mind.</b> He probably made it up earlier that day. But I also think he struggles with the decision because he thinks that, if he does it, he won\u2019t make it out alive. He\u2019ll never see his family again. He might even start a war between the Unsullied/Dothraki and the Northmen and KotV waiting outside the city gates. He knows it\u2019s a dishonorable act. <b>He knows Ned Stark would\u2019ve found another way.</b>\u00a0</p><p>Jon\u2019s behavior once in the throne room is almost like the different stages of grief: <i><b>denial, anger, bargaining, depression, acceptance.</b></i>\u00a0(And, again, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s because he loves her; it\u2019s because of what he has to do and what it makes him.) Previously, even though he\u2019s probably always known deep down that one day it would come to this, he\u2019s been in denial. <b>He\u2019s done his very best to take the easy way out, to not confront, to hope he can keep mollifying her, but now he walks in angry.</b></p><p>While she\u2019s gushing about the Iron Throne as if she didn\u2019t just slaughtered a few hundred thousand people or so,<b> Jon confronts her </b>for the first time since\u2026 7.04? Possibly 7.05 when he questioned her using Drogon on the battlefield. And<b> I don\u2019t think Jon would\u2019ve done that if he believed Dany would leave that room alive.</b> It\u2019s much too dangerous. He\u2019s avoided confronting her thus far for a reason.</p><p>And, remember, he <i>just</i> defended this act of hers to Tyrion. But now they\u2019re letting us see how Jon really feels.</p><blockquote><p><i><b>J:</b> \u201cI saw them executing Lannister prisoners in the street.\nThey said they were acting on your orders.\u201d</i></p><p><i><b>D: </b>\u201cIt was necessary.\u201d</i></p><p><i><b>J:</b> \u201cNecessary? Have you been down there? Have you seen? Children, little children, burned!\u201d</i></p><p><i><b>D: </b>\u201cI tried to make peace with Cersei.\nShe used their innocence as a weapon against me.\nShe thought it would cripple me.\u201d</i></p></blockquote><p>A terrifying thing to say. It <i>should\u2019ve</i> stayed Dany\u2019s hand. And Jon knows it\u2019s useless to argue, so he moves on and<b> it leads to bargaining.</b></p><blockquote><p><i><b>J:</b> \u201cAnd Tyrion?\u201d</i></p><p><i><b>D: </b>\u201cHe conspired behind my back with my enemies.\nHow have you treated people who\u2019ve done the same to you, even when it broke your heart?\u201d</i></p><p><i><b>J:</b> \u201cForgive him.\u201d</i></p><p><i><b>D:</b> \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</i></p><p><i><b>J:</b> \u201cYou can.\nYou can forgive all of them, make them see they made a mistake.\nMake them understand.\nPlease, Dany.\u201d</i><br></p></blockquote><p>What I think Jon is pleading for here isn\u2019t that Dany forgives everyone. I think Jon\u2019s desperately pleading for her to give him a reason to not go through with what he came to the throne room to do. He doesn\u2019t want to kill her. He doesn\u2019t. And especially not this way. It\u2019s so easy for us to sit at home and judge and say <i>KILL HER KILL HER</i>. I sure as hell have said it. But would we be able to do it? In self-defense, maybe, but just walk up to her and stab her in the heart? I\u2019m not sure I could\u2019ve done it.<br></p><p><b>Yes, Jon has killed people before but only men. Women he\u2019s <i>avoided</i> killing. </b>Even when he banished Melisandre, he said that if she were to return to the North, he\u2019d have her hanged as a murdered. <i>Have</i> her hanged = he wouldn\u2019t do it himself. He couldn\u2019t kill Ygritte. And this is complicated too. Dany is his blood. She is his family, in a way. And so the pleading goes on until we land here:</p><blockquote><p><i><b>D:</b> \u201cIt\u2019s not easy to see something that\u2019s never been before: a good world.\u201d</i></p><p><i><b>J: </b>\u201cHow do you know? How do you know it\u2019ll be good?\u201d</i></p><p><i><b>D:</b> \u201cBecause I know what is good.\nAnd so do you.\u201d</i></p><p><i><b>J:</b>\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d</i><br></p></blockquote><p>\u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d he says because he\u2019s thinking of what he has to do. <b>He doesn\u2019t know whether killing Dany in cold blood, in this moment where she\u2019s happy and not putting anyone in immediate danger or hurting anyone, would be a good act.</b> It might be necessary. Tyrion certainly seems to think so. But, again, isn\u2019t that the excuse Dany uses? What would Ned Stark do? Would he find a better solution? A good solution. A fair and just (albeit riskier) solution. He would have, wouldn\u2019t he?</p><p>Jon\u2019s crying and lost. The depression stage. Where he should\u2019ve received comfort, but instead Dany as always tries manipulating him into agreeing with her. She\u2019s touching him\u2013a hand on his chest, a hand on his shoulder\u2013while he stands there passive. Struggling. Wrapping his head around what to do. On how to justify it to himself. <b>He needs a trigger.</b> And she gives him one \u2013 <i><b>\u201cThey don\u2019t get to choose.\u201d</b></i> \u2013 and you see the moment he realizes that he has to do it.\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"400\" data-orig-height=\"201\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e2ac16a3a2188125dfa94ff04dbcfae8/tumblr_inline_ps4n1pfh5X1upc2qw_1280.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"400\" data-orig-height=\"201\"></figure><p>There is no reasoning with her. He can\u2019t control her with soft manipulation anymore. <b>Burning down King\u2019s Landing didn\u2019t horrify her; it encouraged her. </b>Every time she doles out her own brand of justice, it makes her more sure she\u2019s right and good. Just like Tyrion said.</p><p>I think Jon knows now\u2013that he <i><b>accepts</b></i> now\u2013what he has to do. He\u2019s not Ned Stark\u2019s son. He\u2019s not honorable. But he is the shield that guards the realms of men. And he is the man who\u2019d kill to protect his family.\u00a0</p><p>\n\nDrogon is close by. They had a staring match before Jon entered the throne room. Jon has ridden Rhaegal. He knows about the bond, how a dragon can follow its rider\u2019s unspoken commands. <b>The moment Dany suspects something\u2019s wrong, Drogon will act. She can\u2019t suspect anything\u2019s wrong.</b><br></p><p>So Jon lets her move in close. He lets her take his hand and put it on her cheek. When she asks him to break the wheel with her\u2013basically a proposal\u2013he gives her the only words he can. Not a yes. <b>Not\u00a0\u201c<i>I love you</i>\u201d because he doesn\u2019t.

They\u2019re awful. It\u2019s obvious that D&amp;D wanted us to keep guessing up until Jon\u2019s hand moved to his dagger. I\u2019d read the leaks so I knew, but imagine if you hadn\u2019t.<b> I watched a reaction video the other day and people had a strong, negative reaction when they thought Jon said yes to Dany\u2019s proposal\u2013and then they <i>cheered</i> when he stabbed her.</b>\u00a0A room full of people who previously had cheered Dany on when she burned the Lannister army now cheered when Jon murdered her. This is what D&amp;D wanted and so Jon\u2019s characterization had to suffer. They decided to write a scene where he had to murder her while kissing her and <b><i>it\u2019s gross as hell.</i></b> But this was the best way they knew how to shock us.</p><h2>They also needed to show us that Jon is the opposite of Dany.\u00a0They\u2019ve been foils the whole series and with Tyrion\u2019s comments earlier and Jon\u2019s hesitation now, they\u2019re making it clear once and for all: Dany would\u2019ve done it. If she believed Jon was an evil man, she would\u2019ve murdered him without hesitation and without regret.\u00a0<b>She kills and kills and kills and never questions the decision</b>. It\u2019s righteous. It\u2019s just. <i>It\u2019s <b>necessary</b>.</i></h2><p><b>So Jon<i> has to </i>question it. </b>Jon\u2019s instinct has to be to find a way out of it. To find a more peaceful solution, like his real father Ned Stark would\u2019ve done. Because Jon isn\u2019t fire and blood. He\u2019s not Dany or Aerys.</p><p>And he has to be torn up about it too. He has to stare at her in shock, he has to cry, he has to ask Tyrion much later whether what they did was the right thing to do. He can\u2019t be like Littlefinger who happily flings Lysa out the Moon Door after telling her the truth about his feelings. Jon\u2019s our hero not a villain.</p><p>And yet Jon killed a woman. A\u00a0woman he was related to, who loved him, who wanted him by her side, who believed he loved her back when he only ever used her, who lost so much <i>because</i> he used her, who chose fear because he couldn\u2019t love her\u2026\u00a0\u00a0\n\n(No, I don\u2019t think either is Jon\u2019s fault, but I\u2019m not so sure he would agree with me.)\n\n</p><h2>So\u00a0by murdering her this way, not in the heat of battle, not to stop her from actively hurting someone, not even by executing her after a fair trial, but as a <i><b>precautionary measure</b></i>, what does that make him?</h2><h2><b>A hero or a monster?</b></h2><p>It\u2019s an excellent question. Something that warrants a lot of discussion about ethics and morals. Something that could\u2019ve made this episode very interesting had D&amp;D actually had the guts to explore it.<b> If they had let Jon speak openly with someone and confess that he didn\u2019t love Dany, open up about his feelings and thoughts, this could\u2019ve changed the whole season.</b></p><p>But <b>instead they chose the very bloody version of will they/won\u2019t they.</b> They wanted us to be unsure of whether Jon would give in to the love they\u2019ve tried to sell us (but Jon doesn\u2019t actually feel) and rule by her side, or whether he would go against his own moral code and murder a woman. And now that I\u2019ve seen the whole season, I can\u2019t help but think that\u2019s the main reason why Jnerys even existed in the first place. To make this murder into a really gross and horrible twist.</p><p>I know everyone and their gerbil tell us Jon loves Dany, that she\u2019s the love of his life, that they\u2019re star-crossed lovers and what have you. But I never saw him fall in love. I never saw him be happy with her (while I saw him being happy with everyone else). I only saw fear and annoyance and anger and obedience and playing a role. The cast telling me Jon loved her is not enough to change that. Tyrion thinking Jon loved Dany is not enough to change that.\n\nJon crying over her dead body is not enough to change that. Isolated, that scene could\u2019ve looked as if he loved her, but looking at this whole episode\u2026? Looking at all of s8 and s7? It just does not make sense to me.\u00a0</p><p>I don\u2019t know whether they filmed different versions of the assassination scene. I don\u2019t know whether they retconned it late in the process and asked for reshoots and did the best they could with the editing. I don\u2019t know whether they always wanted to keep it ambiguous. I don\u2019t even know whether they went for starcrossed lovers and just failed <i>epically</i>. All of them. Except Ramin Djawadi lmao. All I know is that<b> I never saw Jon loving Dany and so I can\u2019t believe it.</b></p><p>So this is my take. This is how I make sense of Jon\u2019s characterization, which seemingly only ever existed because of a twist. As infuriating as that is.</p><p>Thanks for the ask!</p></p>",
                "content": "<p><blockquote><p><i>&nbsp;2/3 What gets Jon fired up? When Tyrion says Dany&rsquo;s nature is fire and blood. This upsets Jon NOT because he believes in Dany, but because he feels it&rsquo;s an attack on him. His defends her because if what Tyrion says is true, then what if he is the same. So he scrambles to make an excuse for her rage. Maybe he&rsquo;s recalling how he let his rage take over in the past, with Ramsay, LF. If he had a dragon, would he have done the same? Immediately, Tyrion asks if he&rsquo;d have done the same and Jon falters.\n\n<br /></i></p><p><i>\n\n3/3 The show seemed desperate to incorporate &ldquo;love is death of duty&rdquo; here, but it doesn&rsquo;t apply. Jon isn&rsquo;t in love with Dany. Tyrion talks realm, Jon&rsquo;s own life being in danger, none of which stir him to action. Tyrion then asks about Sansa, similar to Varys with Ned in S1 (&ldquo;love is death of duty&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t apply here either), which gives Jon pause. He chooses Sansa over Dany. Sansa = familial/romantic love, not duty. Like Ned, this was about love (Sansa) vs honor (killing his kin and Queen).\n\n</i><br /></p></blockquote><hr /><p>You&rsquo;ve hit the nail on the head, anon.</p><p>When I watched this episode, I was so disappointed that the leaks were true that I just watched on in exasperation and detachment. And even though I picked up on a few things (like the repeated mention of Sansa affecting Jon, and Jon&rsquo;s head shake at the claim he loves Dany), I still read the scene like most people did: Jon defended Dany which felt like a complete retcon from what happened in the previous episode and also felt very out of character for Jon.<br /></p><p>I was so sick of the show that I didn&rsquo;t really want to dig deeper, but yesterday&nbsp;I rewatched a few scenes and you&rsquo;re right. <b>Jon&rsquo;s defending himself</b>.</p><p>But let&rsquo;s rewind. I&rsquo;d like to go through the scenes before we reach the makeshift cell scene, because those scenes&nbsp;<i>should</i> inform how we read Jon&rsquo;s interactions with Tyrion and Dany later. <b>Jon keeps <i>showing</i> us that he doesn&rsquo;t agree with her actions</b>, after all.</p><p>(<i>Oh, and this will be long, but it has visual aids. Yay?</i>)</p><p><b>In 8.05 Jon sort of goes against order</b>. Granted, Dany never commanded him to keep fighting, but she keeps fighting and Grey Worm keeps fighting. If Jon really truly followed Dany, he would keep fighting too. But his morals stop him. He sheathes his sword and tries getting everyone out of the city.</p><p>Then 8.06 starts. We follow Tyrion (with Jon and Davos close behind) walking back into King&rsquo;s Landing on a street littered with corpses and ashes and crumbled buildings.<b> They stop at the charred remains of the mother and child Arya tried to help.</b> The little girl still holding her toy horse. Tyrion tells Jon he&rsquo;ll find him later to which Jon replies,&nbsp;&ldquo;<b><i>It&rsquo;s not safe. Let me send some men with you.</i>&rdquo;</b></p><p>Why isn&rsquo;t it safe? We don&rsquo;t know whether Tyrion has told Jon about Jaime, but it&rsquo;s most likely common knowledge by now and Tyrion did include Davos in his betrayal. It was from Davos Tyrion asked the favor to help in smuggling Cersei and Jaime to Pentos. <b>We don&rsquo;t <i>need</i> to see Davos and Tyrion telling Jon. It&rsquo;s implied that he knows.</b>&nbsp;And when Tyrion tells Jon,&nbsp;&ldquo;<i>I&rsquo;m going alone</i>,&rdquo; and Jon follows him with his eyes as Tyrion leaves, the look on Jon&rsquo;s face also implies he knows that Tyrion will try to find out whether his family made it out. Jon&rsquo;s not afraid that a King&rsquo;s Landing survivor will attack Tyrion; <b>Jon is afraid of what Dany will do if she gets her hands on Tyrion</b>. <b>And</b> <b>Jon sending men with Tyrion to protect him is <i>also</i> defying Dany.</b></p><p>After this, Jon interrupts Grey Worm while the latter sentences prisoners of war to die in the name of his queen. Both Jon and Davos argue for the prisoners to remain alive; however, GW has different orders.</p><blockquote><p><b>GW</b>: &ldquo;I obey my queen&rsquo;s commands, not yours.&rdquo;<br /><b>Jon</b>: &ldquo;And what are the queen&rsquo;s commands?&rdquo;<br /><b>GW</b>: &ldquo;Kill all who follow Cersei Lannister.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/4c90111dea10106888bd1153b46b8c23/tumblr_inline_ps42x0F4Ng1upc2qw_1280.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><p><b>Jon physically stops Grey Worm from following these orders and&nbsp;once more Jon defies Dany. </b>Everyone around them draws their weapons. Jon and Grey Worm enter a staring match, and it&rsquo;s Davos who brings Jon back by telling him they need to speak to the queen. And yet it still takes Jon a long moment to step back. He glances at the prisoners, deliberating, looks back at GW. He doesn&rsquo;t want to let GW kill them, but he also knows that if he and his men engage in a battle against the Unsullied, Jon puts even more people at risk. Especially his family, who&rsquo;ll suffer if Dany learns that Jon fought her men. So he makes his decision and walks away.</p><p>As he walks through the square, surrounded by Dothraki,<b> low and dark music drones ominously in the background. Jon looks hard</b>. He glares up at the stairs where the Targaryen banner is hung. Drogon and his rider fly above.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/ac68b196ea126db5b6224c434aa1f4a0/tumblr_inline_ps43g04UOx1upc2qw_1280.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>\n\n<b>Jon stares up at them with an expression that shows us his real feelings for Dany&ndash;and they sure as hell aren&rsquo;t warm</b>.

Grey Worm has kept an eye on Jon&rsquo;s treasonous behavior. He&nbsp;will report to his queen first chance he gets&ndash;and Jon and Dany have a strained relationship as it is. But Jon can&rsquo;t run away either. If he does, Dany will fly after him or even attack his home and his family. All he can do is move forward and try working out a plan.</p><p>Dany holds her terrifying speech and we get a reaction shot of <b>Jon watching her with a dark look in his eyes</b>. It&rsquo;s in these moments&ndash;when she can&rsquo;t see his face&ndash;we&rsquo;re allowed to see Jon&rsquo;s true feelings. There&rsquo;s no love in his eyes. No heartbreak. Not until she mentions Winterfell and we see Jon realizing what this means.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/95353705df7af6bbeeefece7b8378011/tumblr_inline_ps44o0g2Mh1upc2qw_1280.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>This is where Jon&rsquo;s emotions peek through.

A long look. One that, perhaps, was supposed to make us worried she&rsquo;d have Jon escorted off to a cell too. But she only stares at him with contempt before leaving (which makes her quick change in mood later rather odd but, well, apparently EC disagrees). As she walks away, Jon does not follow the ~love of his life~ with his eyes. <b>Not until she and the Unsullied have safely passed him does he turn around and glare at her.</b></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/49c3fdb801f2243d8cd5bc4555299c48/tumblr_inline_ps46gcgEjC1upc2qw_1280.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><p><b>He <i>loathes</i> her.</b> I think even looking at her leaves him with a bad taste in his mouth. There&rsquo;s nothing about his behavior that suggests to me that this is a guy who just realized the woman of his dreams was a monster. He knew. Perhaps not that she was quite <i>this</i> much of a monster. But he knew.</p><p>After Arya pops up out of nowhere, they have a conversation about Dany. Arya calls Dany Jon&rsquo;s queen (as she often does) and Jon replies with,&nbsp;<b>&ldquo;<i>She&rsquo;s everyone&rsquo;s queen now</i>.&rdquo;</b> His voice is gravelly and the way he delivers it, it&rsquo;s clear he doesn&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s a good thing. It&rsquo;s clear he and Arya stand on one side, and Dany on the other. He could just as well have said,&nbsp;<b>&ldquo;<i>Welcome to hell</i>.&rdquo; </b>That&rsquo;s the kind of delivery he gives.</p><p>What follows next has annoyed me and others, because <b>Arya says two things to Jon that Tyrion repeats in the makeshift cell scene</b>. It annoyed me and others because why repeat it? <b>What&rsquo;s the point?</b></p><h2><b>Contrast</b>.</h2><p><b>Jon reacts one way to Arya and a <i>whole</i> different way to Tyrion.</b> It&rsquo;s not inconsistency but a chance for us to compare the real Jon (with Arya) and political!Jon/sacrifical!jon (with Tyrion). It&rsquo;s not well-written, to be clear, but I do believe this is why they did it. Their clumsy way of giving clues.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b398a93dd9fd94ee2d5dedbf09f1b83a/tumblr_inline_ps47b1sdQF1upc2qw_1280.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><p><b>When Arya points out Sansa won&rsquo;t ever bend to Dany, Jon doesn&rsquo;t protest.

He&rsquo;s tried avoiding confrontation with Dany because she&rsquo;s a dangerous woman to confront, but it&rsquo;s now become unavoidable. She mentioned Winterfell in her speech. She hates Sansa. She knows Sansa spread her secret. It&rsquo;s only a matter of time.</p><p>I&rsquo;m still not entirely sure what Jon&rsquo;s plan was here, but when he tells&nbsp;Arya to wait for him outside the city gates, I think he was a man on a mission already. Perhaps he was considering killing Drogon (which would leave Dany just another regular foe. Her armies against his). Perhaps he would make things up as he went along.</p><p>Perhaps he even realizes that he needs to kill Dany. Perhaps he&rsquo;s prepared to do it.</p><p>But before he can leave, Arya stops him and points out another thing,&nbsp;<b>&ldquo;<i>Jon.\nShe knows who you are.\nWho you really are.\nYou&rsquo;ll always be a threat to her</i>.&ldquo;</b></p><p>Jon doesn&rsquo;t comment on this either. <b>He doesn&rsquo;t say it&rsquo;s Dany&rsquo;s right to kill him.

Not at all.</p><p>They keep <i>showing</i> us how Jon feels about her. <b>When Dany can&rsquo;t see him, Jon shows his true feelings. Anger, fear, contempt, disapproval. </b>They show us repeatedly in this episode that Jon would <i>never</i> defend Dany&rsquo;s actions. Which leads us to the scene where Jon defends Dany&rsquo;s actions. :)<br /></p><p>The Jon who walks into Tyrion&rsquo;s cell isn&rsquo;t in&nbsp;&ldquo;let&rsquo;s defend Dany!&rdquo; mode. When Tyrion says he betrayed his queen, Jon tells him he didn&rsquo;t because contrary to what the characters and the cast and the crew try telling us constantly, Jon isn&rsquo;t so far up Dany&rsquo;s ass that he can&rsquo;t tell right from wrong anymore. Tyrion released his brother. Jon would&rsquo;ve done the same.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;d do it again,&rdquo; Tyrion says, &ldquo;now that I&rsquo;ve seen what I&rsquo;ve seen.\nI chose my fate.\nThe people of King&rsquo;s Landing did not.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i><b>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t justify what happened,&rdquo; Jon says. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t try.&rdquo;</b></i><br /></p></blockquote><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/526bed70d9c2ab15b28ac3ec99e45f81/tumblr_inline_ps483b2egc1upc2qw_1280.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Looking at Jon&rsquo;s expression he&rsquo;s heartbroken over what happened in King&rsquo;s Landing. He&rsquo;s most likely still struggling to fully process it and also wondering how much of it is his fault.&nbsp;<i>&ldquo;Let it be fear</i>,&rdquo; she said because he couldn&rsquo;t love her and she sure as hell showed them fear. It&rsquo;s in no way Jon&rsquo;s fault, but what person wouldn&rsquo;t blame themselves on at least some level?</p><p><b>Then Tyrion points out the war is far from over:</b></p><blockquote><p><i><b>T:</b> &ldquo;She liberated the people of Slaver&rsquo;s Bay.\nShe liberated the people of King&rsquo;s Landing.\nAnd she&rsquo;ll go on liberating until the people of the world are free and she rules them all.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i><b>J: </b>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;ve been by her side, counseling her.\nUntil today.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i><b>T: </b>&Prime;Until today.&rdquo;</i><br /></p></blockquote><p><b>Jon doesn&rsquo;t hide is disapproval at Tyrion having been Dany&rsquo;s Hand.&nbsp;</b></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/653b1d9ca385cfbec828c24cd827b561/tumblr_inline_ps4aps5Nzb1upc2qw_1280.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Look at the guy. <b>Jon is <i>judging</i> Tyrion. </b>Please look at this gif and tell me that Jon&ndash;the <i>real</i> Jon (because this is the real Jon, for once)&ndash;would actually defend Dany. There&rsquo;s even a hint of an incredulous amusement, as if <b>he thinks Tyrion is a god damn hypocrite and he can&rsquo;t believe the words coming out of the guy&rsquo;s mouth.</b></p><p>Jon seems to think,&nbsp;<b>&ldquo;<i>If you knew all along what she is, then why the hell did you help her in invading Westeros? Why did you snitch on Varys when Varys was trying to </i>stop<i> her?</i>&rdquo;</b> And it&rsquo;s easy for Jon to judge. He got involved with Dany because death was coming and he believed he needed her dragons and her armies to stop it. He did what he had to to save everyone he loves and, you know, the world. And he&rsquo;s stayed by Dany&rsquo;s side because he needed to protect his family from her. What was Tyrion&rsquo;s excuse?<br /></p><p><b>Then comes the complete switch in Jon&rsquo;s attitude. </b>The switch that you, anon, brought up: Tyrion makes this about House words. He makes it about <i><b>blood</b></i>.</p><blockquote><p><i><b>T:&nbsp;</b>&ldquo;Our queen&rsquo;s nature is fire and blood&ndash;&rdquo;</i></p><p><i><b>J:&nbsp;</b>&ldquo;You think our house words are stamped on our bodies when we&rsquo;re born and that&rsquo;s who we are? Then I&rsquo;d be fire and blood too.&ldquo;</i></p></blockquote><h2><b><i>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;d be fire and blood too.&rdquo;</i></b></h2><p>Finally, Jon&rsquo;s identity crisis is addressed: he&rsquo;s triggered by the suggestion that he and Dany could be the same.</p><p>Unfortunately, this is not just way too damn late. It&rsquo;s also badly written because it&rsquo;s so very contrived.</p><p><b>I think this scene mostly exists for two reasons:</b> they needed someone to explain to the audience why assassinating Dany was justified, to point out that this is her pattern, and make sure we all knew that she needed to be stopped. Which is hamfisted and insulting to the audience&rsquo;s intelligence. But they also wanted to <i>actually</i> insult their audience by pointing out that those of us who&rsquo;ve cheered Dany on were part of the problem. We&rsquo;ve accepted her horrible deeds without questioning. We&rsquo;ve cheered her on and she&rsquo;s grown stronger and stronger as an icon until she became the face of this show. They&rsquo;re basically slapping their audience in the face for drinking the koolaid they gave us.<br /></p><h2>But they&rsquo;re also asking a rather interesting question that, in better hands, could&rsquo;ve made this scene very compelling: if it were you, <b>if you were the one with almost unlimited power, would you be any better?</b></h2><p>If you could round up really bad criminals and burn them alive without repercussions, would you do it? Would you do it even if you weren&rsquo;t 100% sure everyone was guilty? If someone told you 9 out of 10 were guilty of human trafficking but that one was innocent and you couldn&rsquo;t know whom, would you still do it? Would you think that sacrificing one person to make the world a better place would be worth it?</p><p>Daenerys thinks so. She would sacrifice thousands. Possibly even millions. But would you? Would Jon? Another&nbsp;Targaryen who has ridden dragons and who has an inner beast that appears every so often. When he killed Janos Slynt, when he beat Ramsay to a pulp, when he throttled Littlefinger.</p><p><b>Jon is a hot-headed guy and a killer and a Targaryen.</b> And now he&rsquo;s facing a very important question:&nbsp;<b>If Dany is a monster because she&rsquo;s fire and blood, then what does that make Jon? </b>If Dany is her father, then what does that make Jon?</p><p>His biological father was hardly an admirable man. He abandoned his wife and children for a teenager to fulfill a prophecy, something Jon would never ever do. And yet he has spent the last few weeks lying to his family while banging a woman he doesn&rsquo;t love just to get her dragons. Something Ned Stark would&nbsp;<i>never</i>&nbsp;do, but perhaps Rhaegar would.</p><p>\n\nWhen Jon defends Dany by giving weak excuses, he&rsquo;s not actually defending Dany. He&rsquo;s doing his best not to examine or even acknowledge his identity crisis, because that would mean examining himself and the things he&rsquo;s done he&rsquo;s not proud of<b>. He&rsquo;d have to wonder: is this the Targaryen in me?</b></p><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m tired of fighting.\nIt&rsquo;s all I&rsquo;ve done since I left home.\nI&rsquo;ve killed brothers of the Night&rsquo;s Watch.\nI&rsquo;ve killed wildlings.\nI&rsquo;ve killed men that I admire.\nI hanged a boy younger than Bran.&ldquo;</i></p></blockquote><p>And he&rsquo;s killed on the battlefield. He&rsquo;s most likely lost count of how many men he&rsquo;s killed by now. And he knows well how rage can take over, how blood lust can take over until you&rsquo;re completely lost. The way he just saw his men lose it when they started attacking anything that moved despite the bells sounding out surrender.</p><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;<b>Aye, it&rsquo;s easy to judge when you&rsquo;re standing far from the battlefield.</b>&ldquo;<br /></i></p></blockquote><h2>Then Tyrion says something that catches Jon off guard completely. The thing Jon doesn&rsquo;t want to ask himself:&nbsp;<b>&rdquo;<i>Would you have done it?</i>&rdquo;<br /></b></h2><p>Jon is taken aback at first. Then he claims he doesn&rsquo;t know, but I think he does know. Of course he wouldn&rsquo;t have burned down King&rsquo;s Landing. He doesn&rsquo;t trust Tyrion, though, and won&rsquo;t speak openly with him. But I think the biggest reason is Doylist: they wanted&nbsp;Tyrion to spell out for the audience that, even when Dany punished bad men, she did it in horrible ways and that it all contributed to her getting a very skewed view of justice. It&rsquo;s weak writing, but they needed to make a point&ndash;and they needed to show us the difference between Jon and Dany.</p><blockquote><p><i><b>Tyrion</b>: &ldquo;Everywhere she goes, evil men die and we cheer her for it.\nAnd she grows more powerful and more sure that she is good and right.\nShe believes her destiny is to build a better world for everyone.\nIf you believed that if you truly believed it, wouldn&rsquo;t you kill whoever stood between you and paradise?&ldquo;</i></p></blockquote><p>Here&rsquo;s the thing: Tyrion explains to us&ndash;and to Jon&ndash;that <b>Dany killed (without a trial) men who&rsquo;d done awful things (slavers). </b>He explains to us&ndash;and to Jon&ndash;that <b>Dany killed men <i>before</i> they did awful things (the khals). And isn&rsquo;t that exactly what Tyrion now wants Jon to do?&nbsp;</b></p><h2><i><b>Isn&rsquo;t that what Jon has been wrestling with the whole episode so far? (And will keep wrestling with.)</b></i></h2><p>He needs to stop Dany. But he probably can&rsquo;t defeat her in a way that leads to a trial. He can&rsquo;t kill her in an honorable way or even have someone else do it with a hanging or a beheading. <b>He&rsquo;ll need to assassinate her. So, again, what does that make him? How is he better than she is?</b>&nbsp;</p><h2>Yes, he&rsquo;d be doing it for the greater good, but isn&rsquo;t that what she believes she has done so far?</h2><p>So how does that make Jon better?</p><p>Perhaps Jon <i>was</i> determined to kill Dany earlier, but now, by trying to encourage Jon to do it, Tyrion actually gives Jon doubts. Which isn&rsquo;t that odd. Jon could&rsquo;ve let his rage carry him, but now Tyrion invites him to actually examine the action long before Jon can go through with it.&nbsp;</p><p>But Tyrion&ndash;who&rsquo;s in love with Dany&ndash;doesn&rsquo;t understand why Jon hesitates. He thinks Jon is loyal and in love, but <b>when Tyrion says,&nbsp;<i>&ldquo;I know you love her,&rdquo; </i>Jon looks annoyed. </b>Even angry. Provoked.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b2ca135d442bc0c8021caa9d1ececc57/tumblr_inline_ps4bzy7Eyp1upc2qw_1280.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>We&rsquo;ve seen this reaction of his before.

I bet a huge part of him wants to scream,&nbsp;&ldquo;<i><b>I DON&rsquo;T!&rdquo; </b></i>But he can&rsquo;t. Because he doesn&rsquo;t trust Tyrion and he&rsquo;s been keeping this secret for so long that telling it now, in this situation and to this man, would be the dumbest thing he could do.</p><p>I really do think that Jon&rsquo;s biggest struggle here is that he doesn&rsquo;t want to assassinate an essentially defenseless woman (because without her dragon and her armies, she is). A woman he&rsquo;s related to, a woman who loves him, a woman he&rsquo;s been manipulating for a long while. <b>Dany is abusive toward him, but the world he lives in is completely unaware of that being a thing. In the world he lives in, killing a woman in cold blood is dishonorable and evil. It&rsquo;s against his moral code.</b></p><p>He&rsquo;s also pledged himself to her (duty) and now he&rsquo;s facing having to kill her to protect his family (love). Love is the death of duty, he says, because he and Tyrion are having somewhat different conversations since Jon doesn&rsquo;t tell Tyrion the truth. So Tyrion (and we) keep thinking Jon&rsquo;s romantic feelings for Dany is clashing with his sense telling him she needs to be stopped, when I think Jon&rsquo;s having a big ass identity crisis. Not just an identity crisis because of his Targaryen blood, but also about <b>who he&rsquo;ll be if he kills Dany the way he knows he must. Not on a battlefield but in a quiet, possibly even intimate moment. It&rsquo;s the only way he can get close enough.</b></p><p>Then Tyrion speaks a bit more plainly.</p><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a terrible thing I&rsquo;m asking.\nIt&rsquo;s also the right thing.\nDo you think I&rsquo;m the last man she&rsquo;ll execute? Who is more dangerous than the rightful heir to the Iron Throne?&ldquo;</i></p></blockquote><p><b>There&rsquo;s a huge shift in Jon&rsquo;s demeanor here. You literally see him slipping back into&nbsp;&ldquo;Whatever my queen commands, I will obey&rdquo; mode.&nbsp;</b></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/5dc3d1d0ef17d1b29eed42c41dab7492/tumblr_inline_ps4l5guV3O1upc2qw_1280.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/5ee276f9b3fa7c424577594d95bdaed7/tumblr_inline_ps4l5gNkCW1upc2qw_1280.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/677a1def5f9f192d4e3874cf99a65cc4/tumblr_inline_ps4e5qrBdo1upc2qw_1280.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Even Tyrion&rsquo;s all, <i>dude wtf</i>? But Jon&nbsp;<i>has</i> to slip back into this role. This isn&rsquo;t whipped!Jon. This is <i>terrified</i> Jon.<b> Tyrion&rsquo;s&nbsp;asking Jon to commit treason. A word that&rsquo;s kept popping up this season&ndash;and Jon made it clear how much it frightened him as early as in 8.01.</b></p><p>Outside wait guards who (as they established in 8.05) speak the Common Tongue. They could be listening in on every word they say. And even if they don&rsquo;t overhear, what if Tyrion is playing the game? Jon doesn&rsquo;t trust him. Tyrion lured him into a trap. He ratted out his best friend. He put Sansa at risk. He stood by Dany&rsquo;s side as she invaded Westeros. What if he tells on Jon too? Just to save himself. I think Jon does like Tyrion but <i>trust</i>? No.</p><h2>If Dany in any way suspects that Jon isn&rsquo;t loyal to her, she&rsquo;ll jump aboard that dragon of hers and burn down Winterfell. Jon can&rsquo;t risk setting her off.</h2><p><b>Compare this to Jon&rsquo;s reaction when Arya said the same. It&rsquo;s not similar in the slightest</b>. With Arya, we saw the real Jon. Here, we don&rsquo;t. We see the Jon most of s8 has given us: Dany&rsquo;s obedient servant. The Jon who shuts Sansa up in a meeting because that&rsquo;s the only way he thinks he can be the shield between Dany and the people he loves.&nbsp;</p><p>After this Jon tries leaving the room. This is getting too dangerous. But Tyrion doesn&rsquo;t understand Jon. Tyrion still thinks he needs to convince Jon that Dany is dangerous, so he pulls the family card.</p><blockquote><p><i><b>T: </b>&ldquo;And your sisters? Do you see them bending the knee?&rdquo;<br /><br /><b>J:</b> &ldquo;My sisters will be loyal to the throne.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i><b>T:</b> &ldquo;Why do you think Sansa told me the truth about you? Because she doesn&rsquo;t want Dany to be queen.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i><b>J: </b>&ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t get to choose.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i><b>T: </b>&ldquo;No.\nBut you do.&rdquo;</i><br /></p></blockquote><p>\n\nAgain: compare this to Jon&rsquo;s behavior with Arya. He said nothing of the sort because he didn&rsquo;t have to protect Sansa with lies when talking to Arya. This is Jon terrified of saying the wrong thing. <b>This is &ldquo;I&rsquo;m loyal to my beloved Joffrey&rdquo; Jon</b>. And, yes, it&rsquo;s bad writing. It is. They&rsquo;re <i>straining</i> to keep up the ruse up until the last minute. They don&rsquo;t want us to think that Jon is walking into the throne room determined to kill Dany. Even though Jon looked ready to assassinate her or at least betray her in some way earlier in the episode&ndash;or perhaps <i>because</i> he did&ndash;they now need to make us doubt that he&rsquo;d ever go against her. And they needed to get in the line,&nbsp;<i><b>&ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t get to choose,</b></i>&rdquo; so that Dany&rsquo;s line later,&nbsp;<i><b>&ldquo;They don&rsquo;t get to choose,&rdquo;</b></i> makes it clear why Jon finally takes the plunge.<br /></p><p><b>Sansa was always supposed to be the final trigger.</b> But instead of making that explicit throughout the season (most likely because then it wouldn&rsquo;t be as surprising), they did this.</p><p><b>When Jon stalks toward the throne room, I do think he&rsquo;s already more or less made up his mind.</b> He probably made it up earlier that day. But I also think he struggles with the decision because he thinks that, if he does it, he won&rsquo;t make it out alive. He&rsquo;ll never see his family again. He might even start a war between the Unsullied/Dothraki and the Northmen and KotV waiting outside the city gates. He knows it&rsquo;s a dishonorable act. <b>He knows Ned Stark would&rsquo;ve found another way.</b>&nbsp;</p><p>Jon&rsquo;s behavior once in the throne room is almost like the different stages of grief: <i><b>denial, anger, bargaining, depression, acceptance.</b></i>&nbsp;(And, again, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s because he loves her; it&rsquo;s because of what he has to do and what it makes him.) Previously, even though he&rsquo;s probably always known deep down that one day it would come to this, he&rsquo;s been in denial. <b>He&rsquo;s done his very best to take the easy way out, to not confront, to hope he can keep mollifying her, but now he walks in angry.</b></p><p>While she&rsquo;s gushing about the Iron Throne as if she didn&rsquo;t just slaughtered a few hundred thousand people or so,<b> Jon confronts her </b>for the first time since&hellip; 7.04? Possibly 7.05 when he questioned her using Drogon on the battlefield. And<b> I don&rsquo;t think Jon would&rsquo;ve done that if he believed Dany would leave that room alive.</b> It&rsquo;s much too dangerous. He&rsquo;s avoided confronting her thus far for a reason.</p><p>And, remember, he <i>just</i> defended this act of hers to Tyrion. But now they&rsquo;re letting us see how Jon really feels.</p><blockquote><p><i><b>J:</b> &ldquo;I saw them executing Lannister prisoners in the street.\nThey said they were acting on your orders.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i><b>D: </b>&ldquo;It was necessary.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i><b>J:</b> &ldquo;Necessary? Have you been down there? Have you seen? Children, little children, burned!&rdquo;</i></p><p><i><b>D: </b>&ldquo;I tried to make peace with Cersei.\nShe used their innocence as a weapon against me.\nShe thought it would cripple me.&rdquo;</i></p></blockquote><p>A terrifying thing to say. It <i>should&rsquo;ve</i> stayed Dany&rsquo;s hand. And Jon knows it&rsquo;s useless to argue, so he moves on and<b> it leads to bargaining.</b></p><blockquote><p><i><b>J:</b> &ldquo;And Tyrion?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i><b>D: </b>&ldquo;He conspired behind my back with my enemies.\nHow have you treated people who&rsquo;ve done the same to you, even when it broke your heart?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i><b>J:</b> &ldquo;Forgive him.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i><b>D:</b> &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i><b>J:</b> &ldquo;You can.\nYou can forgive all of them, make them see they made a mistake.\nMake them understand.\nPlease, Dany.&rdquo;</i><br /></p></blockquote><p>What I think Jon is pleading for here isn&rsquo;t that Dany forgives everyone. I think Jon&rsquo;s desperately pleading for her to give him a reason to not go through with what he came to the throne room to do. He doesn&rsquo;t want to kill her. He doesn&rsquo;t. And especially not this way. It&rsquo;s so easy for us to sit at home and judge and say <i>KILL HER KILL HER</i>. I sure as hell have said it. But would we be able to do it? In self-defense, maybe, but just walk up to her and stab her in the heart? I&rsquo;m not sure I could&rsquo;ve done it.<br /></p><p><b>Yes, Jon has killed people before but only men. Women he&rsquo;s <i>avoided</i> killing. </b>Even when he banished Melisandre, he said that if she were to return to the North, he&rsquo;d have her hanged as a murdered. <i>Have</i> her hanged = he wouldn&rsquo;t do it himself. He couldn&rsquo;t kill Ygritte. And this is complicated too. Dany is his blood. She is his family, in a way. And so the pleading goes on until we land here:</p><blockquote><p><i><b>D:</b> &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not easy to see something that&rsquo;s never been before: a good world.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i><b>J: </b>&ldquo;How do you know? How do you know it&rsquo;ll be good?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i><b>D:</b> &ldquo;Because I know what is good.\nAnd so do you.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i><b>J:</b>&nbsp;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</i><br /></p></blockquote><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he says because he&rsquo;s thinking of what he has to do. <b>He doesn&rsquo;t know whether killing Dany in cold blood, in this moment where she&rsquo;s happy and not putting anyone in immediate danger or hurting anyone, would be a good act.</b> It might be necessary. Tyrion certainly seems to think so. But, again, isn&rsquo;t that the excuse Dany uses? What would Ned Stark do? Would he find a better solution? A good solution. A fair and just (albeit riskier) solution. He would have, wouldn&rsquo;t he?</p><p>Jon&rsquo;s crying and lost. The depression stage. Where he should&rsquo;ve received comfort, but instead Dany as always tries manipulating him into agreeing with her. She&rsquo;s touching him&ndash;a hand on his chest, a hand on his shoulder&ndash;while he stands there passive. Struggling. Wrapping his head around what to do. On how to justify it to himself. <b>He needs a trigger.</b> And she gives him one &ndash; <i><b>&ldquo;They don&rsquo;t get to choose.&rdquo;</b></i> &ndash; and you see the moment he realizes that he has to do it.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e2ac16a3a2188125dfa94ff04dbcfae8/tumblr_inline_ps4n1pfh5X1upc2qw_1280.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>There is no reasoning with her. He can&rsquo;t control her with soft manipulation anymore. <b>Burning down King&rsquo;s Landing didn&rsquo;t horrify her; it encouraged her. </b>Every time she doles out her own brand of justice, it makes her more sure she&rsquo;s right and good. Just like Tyrion said.</p><p>I think Jon knows now&ndash;that he <i><b>accepts</b></i> now&ndash;what he has to do. He&rsquo;s not Ned Stark&rsquo;s son. He&rsquo;s not honorable. But he is the shield that guards the realms of men. And he is the man who&rsquo;d kill to protect his family.&nbsp;</p><p>\n\nDrogon is close by. They had a staring match before Jon entered the throne room. Jon has ridden Rhaegal. He knows about the bond, how a dragon can follow its rider&rsquo;s unspoken commands. <b>The moment Dany suspects something&rsquo;s wrong, Drogon will act. She can&rsquo;t suspect anything&rsquo;s wrong.</b><br /></p><p>So Jon lets her move in close. He lets her take his hand and put it on her cheek. When she asks him to break the wheel with her&ndash;basically a proposal&ndash;he gives her the only words he can. Not a yes. <b>Not&nbsp;&ldquo;<i>I love you</i>&rdquo; because he doesn&rsquo;t. He can&rsquo;t tell her that; she&rsquo;d know he&rsquo;s lying and then the opportunity&rsquo;s gone</b>. She&rsquo;s not love. She&rsquo;s duty. He&rsquo;s pledged himself to her. So he says: &ldquo;<i>You are my queen. Now and always.</i>&rdquo; An answer that pleases her. An answer she takes as a yes.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/7fae966a104551ed3aa6d0a7c8da70ae/tumblr_inline_ps4nxvMUqo1upc2qw_1280.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>She moves in for the kiss. He stands completely still and lets it happen. And <b>right before her lips touch his, his hand moves for the dagger.</b></p><hr /><p>I don&rsquo;t like these writing choices, to be clear. They&rsquo;re awful. It&rsquo;s obvious that D&amp;D wanted us to keep guessing up until Jon&rsquo;s hand moved to his dagger. I&rsquo;d read the leaks so I knew, but imagine if you hadn&rsquo;t.<b> I watched a reaction video the other day and people had a strong, negative reaction when they thought Jon said yes to Dany&rsquo;s proposal&ndash;and then they <i>cheered</i> when he stabbed her.</b>&nbsp;A room full of people who previously had cheered Dany on when she burned the Lannister army now cheered when Jon murdered her. This is what D&amp;D wanted and so Jon&rsquo;s characterization had to suffer. They decided to write a scene where he had to murder her while kissing her and <b><i>it&rsquo;s gross as hell.</i></b> But this was the best way they knew how to shock us.</p><h2>They also needed to show us that Jon is the opposite of Dany.&nbsp;They&rsquo;ve been foils the whole series and with Tyrion&rsquo;s comments earlier and Jon&rsquo;s hesitation now, they&rsquo;re making it clear once and for all: Dany would&rsquo;ve done it. If she believed Jon was an evil man, she would&rsquo;ve murdered him without hesitation and without regret.&nbsp;<b>She kills and kills and kills and never questions the decision</b>. It&rsquo;s righteous. It&rsquo;s just. <i>It&rsquo;s <b>necessary</b>.</i></h2><p><b>So Jon<i> has to </i>question it. </b>Jon&rsquo;s instinct has to be to find a way out of it. To find a more peaceful solution, like his real father Ned Stark would&rsquo;ve done. Because Jon isn&rsquo;t fire and blood. He&rsquo;s not Dany or Aerys.</p><p>And he has to be torn up about it too. He has to stare at her in shock, he has to cry, he has to ask Tyrion much later whether what they did was the right thing to do. He can&rsquo;t be like Littlefinger who happily flings Lysa out the Moon Door after telling her the truth about his feelings. Jon&rsquo;s our hero not a villain.</p><p>And yet Jon killed a woman. A&nbsp;woman he was related to, who loved him, who wanted him by her side, who believed he loved her back when he only ever used her, who lost so much <i>because</i> he used her, who chose fear because he couldn&rsquo;t love her&hellip;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n(No, I don&rsquo;t think either is Jon&rsquo;s fault, but I&rsquo;m not so sure he would agree with me.)\n\n</p><h2>So&nbsp;by murdering her this way, not in the heat of battle, not to stop her from actively hurting someone, not even by executing her after a fair trial, but as a <i><b>precautionary measure</b></i>, what does that make him?</h2><h2><b>A hero or a monster?</b></h2><p>It&rsquo;s an excellent question. Something that warrants a lot of discussion about ethics and morals. Something that could&rsquo;ve made this episode very interesting had D&amp;D actually had the guts to explore it.<b> If they had let Jon speak openly with someone and confess that he didn&rsquo;t love Dany, open up about his feelings and thoughts, this could&rsquo;ve changed the whole season.</b></p><p>But <b>instead they chose the very bloody version of will they/won&rsquo;t they.</b> They wanted us to be unsure of whether Jon would give in to the love they&rsquo;ve tried to sell us (but Jon doesn&rsquo;t actually feel) and rule by her side, or whether he would go against his own moral code and murder a woman. And now that I&rsquo;ve seen the whole season, I can&rsquo;t help but think that&rsquo;s the main reason why Jnerys even existed in the first place. To make this murder into a really gross and horrible twist.</p><p>I know everyone and their gerbil tell us Jon loves Dany, that she&rsquo;s the love of his life, that they&rsquo;re star-crossed lovers and what have you. But I never saw him fall in love. I never saw him be happy with her (while I saw him being happy with everyone else). I only saw fear and annoyance and anger and obedience and playing a role. The cast telling me Jon loved her is not enough to change that. Tyrion thinking Jon loved Dany is not enough to change that.\n\nJon crying over her dead body is not enough to change that. Isolated, that scene could&rsquo;ve looked as if he loved her, but looking at this whole episode&hellip;? Looking at all of s8 and s7? It just does not make sense to me.&nbsp;</p><p>I don&rsquo;t know whether they filmed different versions of the assassination scene. I don&rsquo;t know whether they retconned it late in the process and asked for reshoots and did the best they could with the editing. I don&rsquo;t know whether they always wanted to keep it ambiguous. I don&rsquo;t even know whether they went for starcrossed lovers and just failed <i>epically</i>. All of them. Except Ramin Djawadi lmao. All I know is that<b> I never saw Jon loving Dany and so I can&rsquo;t believe it.</b></p><p>So this is my take. This is how I make sense of Jon&rsquo;s characterization, which seemingly only ever existed because of a twist. As infuriating as that is.</p><p>Thanks for the ask!</p></p>",
                "content_abstract": "<p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><i>&nbsp;2/3 What gets Jon fired up? When Tyrion says Dany&rsquo;s nature is fire and blood. This upsets Jon NOT because he believes in Dany, but because he feels it&rsquo;s an attack on him. His defends her because if what Tyrion says is true, then what if he is the same. So he scrambles to make an excuse for her rage. Maybe he&rsquo;s recalling how he let his rage take over in the past, with Ramsay, LF. If he had a dragon, would he have done the same? Immediately, Tyrion asks if he&rsquo;d have done the same and Jon falters.\n\n<br /></i></p>\n<p><i>\n\n3/3 The show seemed desperate to incorporate &ldquo;love is death of duty&rdquo; here, but it doesn&rsquo;t apply. Jon isn&rsquo;t in love with Dany. Tyrion talks realm, Jon&rsquo;s own life being in danger, none of which stir him to action. Tyrion then asks about Sansa, similar to Varys with Ned in S1 (&ldquo;love is death of duty&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t apply here either), which gives Jon pause. He chooses Sansa over Dany. Sansa = familial/romantic love, not duty. Like Ned, this was about love (Sansa) vs honor (killing his kin and Queen).\n\n</i><br /></p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr />\n<p>You&rsquo;ve hit the nail on the head, anon.</p>\n<p>When I watched this episode, I was so disappointed that the leaks were true that I just watched on in exasperation and detachment. And even though I picked up on a few things (like the repeated mention of Sansa affecting Jon, and Jon&rsquo;s head shake at the claim he loves Dany), I still read the scene like most people did: Jon defended Dany which felt like a complete retcon from what happened in the previous episode and also felt very out of character for Jon.<br /></p>\n<p>I was so sick of the show that I didn&rsquo;t really want to dig deeper, but yesterday&nbsp;I rewatched a few scenes and you&rsquo;re right. <b>Jon&rsquo;s defending himself</b>.</p>\n<p>But let&rsquo;s rewind. I&rsquo;d like to go through the scenes before we reach the makeshift cell scene, because those scenes&nbsp;<i>should</i> inform how we read Jon&rsquo;s interactions with Tyrion and Dany later. <b>Jon keeps <i>showing</i> us that he doesn&rsquo;t agree with her actions</b>, after all.</p>\n<p>(<i>Oh, and this will be long, but it has visual aids. Yay?</i>)</p>\n</p>",

Turned out it sent my brain into hyper drive and this was the outcome. I did not expect it to be this long. But I have never felt so proud than I have writing this. SO, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mwv_vSZxPQeTauv5UpSpz7w\">@witch-of-letters</a> , I am sorry for the wait and I hope you all enjoy.</b></p><p><b><i>Word Count- 19,891 words. Yes that is correct.</i></b></p><p><b><i>Warnings- death, angst, murder, spoilers (bit late now), fluff, and everything in between.</i></b></p><hr><p>\u201cI bet you can\u2019t shoot an arrow through the middle of the target.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bet I can.\u201d</p><p>Y/N Baratheon was not a girl to be challenged. Especially by Jon Snow. Her closest and dearest friend from the North. </p><p>Ever since her father, King Robert Baratheon, and Ned Stark had formed an allegiance, Y/N had travelled with her father to Winterfell every month. Being the only true born Baratheon of her siblings, Y/N and her father was very close. Whilst Robert and Eddard Stark discussed important royal matters, Y/N and Jon were often causing trouble. From antagonising each other to cause mayhem, or choosing to do so on their own terms, the two together were a handful. With Robb added to the duo, the chaos greatly increased. For the trio showed no mercy with their mischief.</p><p>Robb smirked at the younger duo. Leaning against the pillar, he watched on as Y/N furiously grabbed her bow and arrows. </p><p>\u201cIf you shoot the arrow through the target, you can have my portion of shank at dinner tonight.\u201d</p><p>Jon knew she would never back down the chance to have more food. Even though the Baratheon\u2019s was one of the strongest families in all the kingdoms, the House of Stark produced the most glorious food in the kingdoms. Food that tasted like it was made with love and from the heart. </p><p>Squinting at the young bastard, Y/N nodded. </p><p>\u201cDeal. And if I miss?\u201d</p><p>Jon looked at Robb, a smirk forming on both of their faces.</p><p>\u201cYou have to wear a dress at dinner tonight. And we mean, a dress preserved for weddings and balls; not any sort of old tat.\u201d</p><p>Y/N glared towards Robb as he spoke the conditions. Looking back at Jon, she waited to hear his opinion. </p><p>The young man winked at the young woman, shrugging his shoulders as though he did not know what Robb was going to say. He did. They had agreed on her punishment earlier that morning.</p><p>The young Baratheon loathed dresses. Refusing to wear them, unless for extravagant events; much to her mothers\u2019 chagrin. She preferred to wear breeches and a tunic instead. They were more form fitting than that of a man\u2019s; for her mother only appeased with the clothing if it could be altered to uphold some femininity. </p><p>The boys waited with baited breathes for her response.</p><p>\u201cDeal.\u201d</p><p>Cheers rang from the pair. Y/N shook Jon\u2019s hand. Watching as the young bastard walked towards Robb, and away from the direction of the target. And any areas around it. They were all still learning to shoot, so It was no surprise that an arrow wold stray every now and then.</p><p>Taking a deep breath in, Y/N closed her eyes, slowing her breathing down. Opening her eyes, she raised her bow and arrow. Pulling the string back with necessary force, her vision zeroed in on the target. Moving her aim so that the arrow should fly straight through the centre. Taking one last inhale, she begins to release the string of the bow when-</p><p>\u201cY/N!\u201d</p><p>The shout of her name caused Y/N to flinch, the arrow flying through the air. Embedding itself into the target. Just to the right of the bullseye. </p><p>Y/N groaned, throwing the bow to the floor, she swivelled to the direction of the shout. Looking towards the balcony, Y/N stared at her father. </p><p>\u201cFather look what you did. You just cost me an extra shank you knob.\u201d</p><p>Many would have been shocked to have heard how the princess spoke to the king, but it was normal. The two Baratheon\u2019s were not the conventional pair.</p><p>King Robert chuckled heartily. With Eddard at his side, who raised an eyebrow in his son\u2019s direction. The two boys bowering the heads, to hide their laughter.</p><p>\u201cAll of you get ready for the banquet tonight. Robb come with me and your father. We have matters to discuss.\u201d</p><p>The three friends looked at each other in confusion. Robb shrugged his shoulders as he walked in the direction of your father and his. </p><p>\u201cI wonder what they need him for.\u201d</p><p>Y/N walked towards Jon. The pair watching as Robb and their fathers head into the castle.</p><p>\u201cWell, you better start getting ready. Who knows how long it\u2019ll take to get into your dress.\u201d</p><p>Jon laughed as Y/N turned towards him, stepping so close that their breathes mingled. Leaning impossible closer to his face, Y/N glared into Jon\u2019s eyes. </p><p>\u201cI may have missed the bullseye, but if that was a real man, it would have gone straight through his heart.\u201d</p><p>At the end of her words, Y/N moved back from their proximity and walked in the direction of her chambers. Jon staring at how her hips swayed as she aggressively walked further away. </p><p>Flittering his gaze between his chest and the target, he realised she was right. Shaking his head, Jon began his trek towards his own chambers. The only thought flittering through his mind was how he was one day going to marry Y/N Baratheon; bastard or not. He was going to make it a reality.</p><!-- more --><p><br/></p><p>The banquet had begun 20 minutes before Y/N had arrived. Robb sitting next to his siblings and parents at the head of the hall. Even Theon was sat amongst the Starks. For once, Catelyn had allowed Jon to attend; to appease Y/N\u2019s begs of her friend being present. \u00a0Sitting away from all Baratheon\u2019s and Starks, Jon conversed with his uncle Benjen, speaking of matters that could affect his future greatly.</p><p>Jon had been awaiting Y/N\u2019s arrival. When she had walked through the door, he could not help but catch his breath. Neither could Robb, or any young man in close proximity. Whilst Jon could not tear his eyes away from Y/N, his uncle Benjen left Jon to ogle.</p><p>\u201cBloody hell. She should be bent over and ravished in that dress.\u201d</p><p>Robb elbowed Theon in his stomach. Causing the ward to lose his breath; coughing on the lack of it.</p><p>Y/N looked at the table at the head of the room. Seeing her plate next to her fathers and her mothers. Walking towards it, she reached where it laid. </p><p>At the sight of their daughter, her parents ceased their conversation. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re finally looking like a lady Y/N. What has caused this drastic change? Or should I ask whom?\u201d</p><p>Y/N rolled her eyes at her mother\u2019s words.</p><p>Going to grab her plate, she hiked up her skirt to climb up the platform to the table. </p><p>Piling more vegetables and mashed potatoes on her sparsely filled plate (most likely her mother\u2019s doing) she shoved her shank into her mouth, ripping off a large portion of the meat. With her plate in one hand, and her shank in the other, Y/N pointed at her father with the bone of meat. Amusement clear on his face. Whilst her mother and siblings held disgust. Laughter could be heard from the Stark children at her antics.</p><p>\u201cStupid bets with the stupid Stark boys. I would have had it if father had not called for me.\u201d</p><p>Robert bellowed with laughter at his daughter\u2019s frustration. </p><p>She turned to glare at him, however, she could not keep a smile from taking over.</p><p>\u201cBecause of that, I am going to sit with Jon. The poor bastard is probably bored out of his mind.\u201d</p><p>Cersei shook her head at her daughter\u2019s words.</p><p>\u201cYou will do no such thing.\u201d</p><p>Y/N bore her eyes into her mother\u2019s, taking another bite out of her shank.</p><p>Chewing the meat ever so slowly, she swallowed the chunk. Throwing the bone on her plate, she licked her fingers clean; angering her mother even more. </p><p>\u201cLet her mother, she\u2019s acting like a homeless harlot any way.\u201d</p><p>Whipping her head towards Joffrey, she took in his words. Looking her younger brother up and down with a glare that could kill, the young Lannister swallowed harshly.</p><p>Heading to walk past the Starks and down the steps of the platform, she kept her eyes on Joffrey, stopping to stand in front of the young Stark girls.</p><p>\u201cSansa cover your ears.\u201d</p><p>The girl did so.</p><p>Directing her words back to Joffrey, she smirked at her brother.</p><p>\u201cYou can call me a harlot. But at least I\u2019m not an incestuous little bitch.\u201d</p><p>Cersei\u2019s head whipped in her daughter\u2019s direction. Watching as she diverted her attention to the Starks.</p><p>Y/N smiled as Arya, Theon, and Robb chuckled at her words. Motioning for Sansa to uncover her ears, she knew the girl still heard. But she didn\u2019t care. </p><p>\u201cNow if you\u2019ll excuse me. I have fulfilled my duties and my part of the bet. So, I am going to sit with Jon and enjoy my meal.\u201d</p><p>As she continued her path across the platform, Y/N reached out her hand to quickly grab Theon\u2019s leftover shank.</p><p>The ward standing in his seat.</p><p>\u201cYou fucking bitch! I didn\u2019t finish that.\u201d</p><p>The girl trotted down the steps, walking through the array of people backwards. </p><p>Much like she had done to her father, Y/N used the shank to point at Theon.</p><p>\u201cNext time you talk about bending over a girl and ravishing her without consent, think about how you will go hungry for the rest of the night.\u201d</p><p>Turning to face Jon, she walked towards the man; who had witnessed and heard mostly everything. </p><p>Robb sitting next to Theon, laughed as the ward fell back into his seat in a sulk. </p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s right mate.\u201d</p><p>Theon scoffed.</p><p>\u201cAt least I won\u2019t be married to her and have her not love me back.\u201d</p><p>Robb stared at the Greyjoy.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean? She might learn to love me back.\u201d</p><p>Theon scoffed, continuing to eat the food left on his plate.</p><p>\u201cYou really think her, and Jon only see each other as friends. Why do you think her father and yours are marrying her to you? Jon\u2019s a bastard and not a Stark. If he were, they would be married by morning.\u201d</p><p>Robb shifted in his seat. He knew Y/N did not see him the same as he saw her. But for others to see the obvious tension between Jon and Y/N, and he hadn\u2019t, made it even more real for Robb. </p><p>Sitting back in his seat Robb looked forward.</p><p>\u201cRemember, you aren\u2019t a Stark either Greyjoy. So, stop pretending that you are.\u201d</p><p>Theon paused his eating at Robb\u2019s words. Rage bubbling deep inside as he began to drink his wine excessively. </p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-</p><p>Dropping her plate in front of Jon, Y/N raised her skirt to sit comfortably on the chair. Shovelling Theon\u2019s shank, unattractively, into her mouth. Using her sleeve as a makeshift napkin to wipe her face.</p><p>Jon could not help but watch in amusement. </p><p>Swallowing the food, Y/N looked into her friend\u2019s eyes. </p><p>\u201cHas Ned told you?\u201d</p><p>Taking a swig of his wine, he placed the cup down.</p><p>\u201cTold me what?\u201d</p><p>Wiping her mouth once more, Y/N reached over to grasp Jon\u2019s drink, gulping some down herself.</p><p>\u201cMy father and Ned have arranged for Robb and I to wed.\u201d</p><p>In disbelief, all Jon could do was stare at Y/N.</p><p>Putting his cup back on the table, Y/N leaned her head on her hand, watching herself play with her food.</p><p>\u201cThey haven\u2019t told me yet. Turns out Arya over heard them tell Robb. She came to me straight away. Telling me that Robb did not argue against it, the cunt.\u201d</p><p>Jon licked his lips. Running his hands over his face. Looking back at the young woman in front of him, Jon analysed her expression.</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re not happy with this?\u201d</p><p>Y/N rolled her eyes at his question. </p><p>Waving her hand in the air, she answered.</p><p>\u201cOf course, I am not happy Jon. Robb is like a brother to me. I don\u2019t view him in that way. And unlike some people in these kingdoms, I don\u2019t want to fuck my family. I want to marry whomever I choose.\u201d</p><p>Jon laughed at her words.</p><p>\u201cAnyway, what did Benjen want? You seemed to be having a pretty serious conversation.\u201d</p><p>It was Jon\u2019s turn to stare at his own plate.</p><p>\u201cHe came to inform me that he was travelling to join the Nightswatch. And I told him that I want to join too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>Jon raised his gaze to the girl, seeing her expression fall.</p><p>\u201cSo, Lord Stark, Sansa, and Arya will be travelling to Kingslanding back with your family. I will follow Benjen to the wall-\u201c</p><p>\u201cAnd I will be here, marrying Robb, and helping your mother tend to Bran, whilst Theon does God knows what.\u201d</p><p>All Jon did was nod his head. </p><p>\u201cWell we better make the most of today and tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Raising her shank, she laughed as Jon cheered it with his own. The pair continuing to laugh throughout the feast. </p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-As there last day together approached, Y/N and Jon never left each other\u2019s side. Causing more mischief than ever before. King Robert and Eddard chose not to interfere, knowing that it was going to be a while before they would see each other again. Robb had also left the pair alone, for Y/N would be his wife soon, and they would be together for a long time coming. </p><p>The day went too quickly for the pair, and as morning came, Y/N could not help but feel the tears gather in her eyes at the thought of being left by her father and Jon. </p><p>Watching as Arya and Sansa left with her family in tow. She stood next to the Stark sisters as the clambered onto their horses.</p><p>\u201cKeep Sansa safe Arya.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d The younger Stark replied.</p><p>\u201cAnd Sansa?\u201d</p><p>The older Stark looked towards Y/N.</p><p>The Baratheon smiled.</p><p>\u201cHelp yourself to all my dresses and fabric. I\u2019ve have never worn most of them.\u201d</p><p>Sansa smiled in appreciation.</p><p>Y/N\u2019s expression became more serious.</p><p>\u201cAnd please be careful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d</p><p>The pair went to begin their journey to Kingslanding. </p><p>Y/N turned to the guard next to her; already mounted on his steed.</p><p>\u201cPlease watch over them Sandor. You and I both know how evil of a cunt Joffrey is.\u201d</p><p>The Hound huffed at her words. Lifting the helmet, he placed it on his head.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do my best. Don\u2019t get yourself killed now little Doe.\u201d</p><p>Y/N laughed at his nickname for her, watching as her family and the Starks set of on their journey. </p><p>She had already said goodbye to her father in privacy. Not wanting to cry even more than she knew she would when she would have to say goodbye to Jon.</p><p>Once the carriage and horses were a mere speck in the horizon, she allowed herself to face Jon. Examining the exchange between him and Robb, she could feel her heart hurt at the sight. </p><p>Strolling towards them, Y/N witnessed as the Stark brother\u2019s let each other go. Quickly taking Robb\u2019s position as he left the pair to say their goodbye\u2019s.</p><p>Standing next to his steed, Jon watched as Y/N walked slowly towards him. Quickly gulping down the sobs in her throat, Y/N pulled Jon in too a tight embrace. Burying her head in the crook of his neck, the young pair stayed in that position for a long time, that \u2018just friends\u2019 would deem too long.</p><p>Jon was the first to pull away. Holding her face in his hands, Jon stroked her cheek with his thumb. Catching the tears that had escaped her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI promise that we will see each other soon. You can tell me all about the married life with my brother.\u201d</p><p>Y/N laughed. Clutching Jon\u2019s furs with her fists. She pulled him closer, their heads resting against the others. A solemn look falling on her face.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to marry Robb.\u201d</p><p>Jon let out a breath.</p><p>\u201cI know. I wish you wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>She replied.</p><p>\u201cSo, do I. I love him, but not in the way a man and wife love another.\u201d</p><p>Pulling her head back, Y/N\u2019s hand travelled to Jon\u2019s neck. Her surprisingly warm fingers sending tingles down the man\u2019s spine.</p><p>\u201cPromise we will see each other again.\u201d</p><p>Jon nodded his head. </p><p>\u201cI promise.\u201d</p><p>As he muttered his promise, Y/N leaned her face closer to his own. Placing her lips on his cheek, she slowly pulled them away. Detaching herself from the Stark bastard, Y/N sadly smiled at Jon.</p><p>\u201cYou better get going. By the time you get there, the snow would have melted.\u201d</p><p>Jon chuckled. Mounting his horse, he positioned himself comfortable on the saddle. </p><p>Benjen began to follow the Nightswatch as they started their journey out of the gates of Winterfell.</p><p>Y/N stepped back as Jon trotted his horse to catch up with his uncle. </p><p>\u201cJon!\u201d</p><p>Turning his head, he caught Y/N\u2019s gaze.</p><p>\u201cRemember. If you ever need to, aim to the right.\u201d</p><p>Jon felt a large smile take over his face.</p><p>\u201cStraight at the heart.\u201d</p><p>Y/N smiled in return.</p><p>\u201cStraight at the heart.\u201d</p><p>Much like her father leaving, Y/N stood in her place. Refusing to move until Jon was a speck in the distance.</p><p>As she stood, watching Jon leave, Robb slowly approached. Standing to the side of the Baratheon princess. </p><p>The pair stood in silence. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Robb looked towards his soon to be wife.</p><p>\u201cWhat for?\u201d</p><p>She let a few tears fall.</p><p>\u201cI love him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you too.\u201d</p><p>Robb turned his gaze back to the gates. The two watching as the guards shut them closed.</p><p>\u201cBut not in the same way.\u201d</p><p>Y/N shook her head.</p><p>Placing a hand on Robb\u2019s shoulder, their eyes connected.</p><p>\u201cNo. But I will be the best wife I can be.\u201d</p><p>Robb smiled at her words. He had no doubt she wouldn\u2019t.</p><p>Squeezing his shoulder, Y/N let her hand drop, walking away from Robb and away from the gates where she had said goodbye to her family and Jon. Walking into the castle that she now would call home. But nowhere would be home without her father. And nowhere would make her feel as happy as when she was with Jon.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-As the months passed, it became easier for Y/N to become more comfortable in her permanent residence at Winterfell. Coming to terms of her life with Robb. He was her friend, and he needed her help. Robb accepted the fact that she did not love him the same, but he knew she still cared for him deeply. And when word had come to Winterfell that King Robert Baratheon had sadly passed, Robb\u2019s shoulder was there for Y/N to cry on. Y/N had reciprocated the compassion when news of Ned\u2019s execution hit Winterfell. She hated Joffrey and her mother with a passion.</p><p>The young Baratheon was distraught. Being the closest to her father out of her siblings, she felt as though she had lost the only true family member she had. Heartbroken that she was not at his side when he sadly passed. Her tears of sorrow were soon replaced with tears of dread when she realised what would occur if anyone was to find out the true bloodline of her siblings. She had known for years of Cersei and Jaime\u2019s relationship. How nobody else had realised why she looked so contrasting to her siblings, Y/N prayed for the day that the truth would be revealed to never come.</p><p>However, it did, and as Joffrey sat on the Iron Throne, word had travelled around the kingdoms. Causing the War of the Five Kings to begin. With Joffrey, her uncle Stannis and Renly, Balon Greyjoy, and Robb, all fighting for the throne.</p><p>As the war surged forward, Y/N noticed that Robb\u2019s attention had been caught by one of the young healers; Talisa. Watching the pair converse, Y/N smiled to herself. She was happy that he had finally found true love. And at that moment of thought, Jon entered her mind. She wondered where he was now. If he ever thought of her on his travels. If he was safe, or even still alive. </p><p>On a seemingly quiet night, Catelyn approached Y/N in the drawing room. As she pulled the girl into her embrace, she informed her of the nuptials that would occur that evening.<br/>\u201cFor Robb and I?\u201d</p><p>Catelyn shook her head, a smile taking over her features.</p><p>\u201cNo. For Talisa and Robb.\u201d</p><p>Y/N let out the breath she held. Robb was her \u201cbrother\u201d, and he was finally going to get married. To someone who loved him back.</p><p>\u201cThank high heavens. No disrespect Catelyn. I love your son. But not in that way.\u201d</p><p>The Stark woman laughed at the Baratheon\u2019s exclamation; enveloping her in another hug.</p><p>\u201cI know you mean no harm in your words. It\u2019s not your fault that your heart belongs to Ned\u2019s bastard.\u201d</p><p>Y/N shook her head, pulling herself out of the woman\u2019s grasp.</p><p>\u201cGive the boy some slack Catelyn. He\u2019s out there defending the wall for us.\u201d</p><p>Catelyn dismissed the girl\u2019s words with a wave of her hand.</p><p>\u201cNow let\u2019s get you in something more suitable for a wedding. No more breeches for the rest of the day.\u201d</p><p>Y/N followed begrudgingly as Catelyn helped her get ready for Robb\u2019s wedding. </p><p>Walking across the field, Y/N sauntered into Robb\u2019s tent, watching as he finished getting ready.</p><p>\u201cWell somebody looks like a king.\u201d</p><p>Robb chuckled, turning to his friend. </p><p>\u201cAnd somebody looks like a princess.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI am one, you dickhead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t dress like one.\u201d</p><p>Y/N punched Robb\u2019s shoulder at his words.</p><p>Robb laughed.</p><p>\u201cCome one. Let\u2019s go get you married. This is going to be the best wedding in all the kingdoms.\u201d</p><p>For soon after the ceremony occurred, blood flooded the floors of the room. Waldor Frey\u2019s men killing everyone and anything. With Greywind at her side, and a bow in her hand, Y/N fought off many of the soldiers. Trying her best to protect Robb. </p><p>Out of nowhere, one of Frey\u2019s soldiers jumped from behind, swinging his dagger in Y/N\u2019s direction. Just as Y/N thought this would be her end, Greywind attacked the soldier\u2019s arm, causing the sword to slice Y/N\u2019s face; narrowly missing her eye. She was alive. She could deal with a cut face as long she was alive. Pulling her arrow back, she landed it perfectly into the heart of the solider; Greywind keeping him down with his grip on the man\u2019s arm.</p><p>\u201cY/N!\u201d</p><p>At the shout of her name, she turned to Robb. </p><p>\u201cGet out of here. Take Greywind with you.\u201d</p><p>Y/N shook her head.</p><p>\u201cI am not leaving you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you are. Go find Jon at the wall. I am not going to lose both Talisa and you. Mother and I will be okay. Go.\u201d</p><p>Y/N looked at Catelyn\u2019s direction.</p><p>\u201cGo.\u201d The women whispered.</p><p>AS Catelyn held the knife to the throat of Frey\u2019s wife, Y/N slipped out the room. Quickly mounting one of the horses, with Greywind at her side, and her bow on her back, she fled from the wedding and from Winterfell.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-She could feel in her bones the guilt of leaving Robb and his mother behind. Of not being able to help Talisa. Of not being able to do something more. The guilt and grief only grew more when on her way to the wall, as she stopped to eat in a small tavern, Y/N over-heard of the gruesome events that occurred after she left. Hearing men laugh as they spoke about how Waldor Frey\u2019s soldiers cut off Robb\u2019s head and paraded his body around. How Catelyn\u2019s throat was slit open. How Talisa was murdered, and so was her and Robb\u2019s unborn child.</p><p>She could not hear no more. Continuing to travel as she arrived closer and closer to the wall. Collecting weapons, furs, and food along her travels. Greywind never leaving her side. Y/N remembered the directions to the Nightswatch, having spoken to her father and Eddard about it in great deal; when she was younger. She was always fascinated by the stories of the wall, so it was no surprise that she would want to know more about the men who would be guarding it. </p><p>Y/N had been travelling for weeks when she finally arrived at the wall. Searching for a secluded space, she hopped off of her horse. Stroking the animal\u2019s mane, Y/N grabbed out the necessary food from her satchel. Feeding both the horse and Greywind before devouring an apple herself. She could not risk lighting a fire and cooking. It could draw unwanted attention. But what she didn\u2019t know was that she had already done so by being there. As she was finishing her apple, out of nowhere, Greywind began to snarl. Instantly dropping the core of her fruit, Y/N reached for her bow and arrows; standing in front of the horse with Geywind at her side. </p><p>Looking towards the area where Greywind gazed, she saw fur and lots of it, approaching where she stood at the wall. The figures moved closer and closer. Wildlings. Y/N had no time to run or hide. With the direwolf and horse by her side, she would not be able to escape quietly. Drawing her bow, Y/N made sure her weapons were secure on her body. She was not going to be killed by Wildlings. Not when she had survived this long.</p><p>As they approached, one by one, the Wildlings noticed the woman in front of them. She was dressed very similar to them. The only differences being that her furs were a mixture of red and black. Tormund stood near the front of the group with Ygritte by his side. So, it came as a very big surprise when they reached the wall to enter the watch, that a woman stood in front of it. With a bow in her hand and a huge fucking wolf snarling towards them. </p><p>Y/N pulled her bow to aim at the ginger Wildlings\u2019 chest.</p><p>\u201cTake another fucking step and I will shoot this arrow straight through your heart, Wildling.\u201d</p><p>Tormund let out a boisterous laugh at her words.</p><p>\u201cWill you kill me little fox? Will you kill us all? You don\u2019t know who you are messing with.\u201d</p><p>Without missing a beat, Y/N answered.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Tormund continued to laugh.</p><p>\u201cBut he will help me.\u201d</p><p>AT the sound of her words, Greywind began to growl louder, his body arching as he slowly strode closer to the Wildlings. </p><p>Tormund quickly became quiet. </p><p>\u201cNow if you don\u2019t let me go, I will paint this wall red with your blood and use your skulls as bowls to feed my direwolf. You hear?\u201d</p><p>Silence encompassed them. </p><p>\u201cI like her.\u201d</p><p>Y/N shifted her arrow to the ginger woman at her words.</p><p>Tormund\u2019s shocked expression moving to gaze at her as well. </p><p>Ygritte simply shrugged her shoulders. </p><p>\u201cShe has fire. You of all people should know how strong a person kissed by fire is.\u201d</p><p>The Wildling\u2019s murmured amongst each other, looking at Tormund to respond.</p><p>Tormund looked at Ygritte. The ginger girl giving a quick nod of her head. Their silent conversation coming to an agreement.</p><p>Turning back to the Baratheon, Tormund sheathed his dagger. Taking another step closer; to only take it back as the direwolf growled once more.</p><p>\u201cOkay little fox. We do no harm.\u201d</p><p>Y/N never let her eyes leave the group. Keeping herself on edge for any attack.</p><p>\u201cHere me out little fox.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo not call me fox. I am not a fox.\u201d</p><p>Tormund could see Ygritte smirk in the corner of his eye. Yes. She would fit right in. </p><p>\u201cIf you have no place to stay, come with us Wildlings. You will be safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need your help. I am safer alone.\u201d</p><p>Ygritte rolled her eyes at the girl\u2019s words. She felt that way once too.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t be safe when the Whites arrive.\u201d</p><p>Y/N shook her head. Not wanting to believe her words. She had heard stories, but it has been hundreds of years since White Walkers roamed around Westeroes. But her mind suddenly reeled back to all the warnings Eddard Stark had given before his death. Winter is Coming. That is what he meant.</p><p>Slowly lowering her bow, she kept the object in a type grip at her side. Clicking her tongue, she signalled for Greywind to heel at her feet. The direwolf still on high alert.</p><p>\u201cIf I was to come with you, you swear an oath to do me no harm.\u201d</p><p>Tormund laughed once more. As did many of the other Wildlings.</p><p>\u201cAn oath? Were Wildlings. You\u2019re lucky to even be offered shelter.\u201d</p><p>Y/N continued to stare at the man, her eyes flickering to Ygritte\u2019s, as the woman\u2019s expression remained serious.</p><p>\u201cWe swear.\u201d</p><p>At Ygritte\u2019s words, the Wildlings bellowed disagreements. </p><p>Y/N, taking Ygritte\u2019s word, began to lead her direwolf and horse towards the Wildlings. She trusted Ygritte. She even felt compelled to trust the big ginger one, but she still kept her eye out for any dirty bastard who would break their word.</p><p>\u201cFine. We will amuse this oath. But if you are to stay with us, you will live the Wildling way. They call me Tormund Giantsbane.\u201d</p><p>As they began to head towards the Wildling\u2019s keep, Y/N walked between Tormund and Ygritte. The rest of the Wildlings in front of them. Greywind stayed close behind Y/N for protection, as she led her horse by its reigns.</p><p>\u201cWhy Giantsbane?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI killed a giant when I was 10. Then I climbed right into bed with his wife. When she woke up, she suckled me at her teat for three months. Thought I was her baby. That\u2019s how I got so strong: giant\u2019s milk.\u201d</p><p>Y/N could not help but smile at the man\u2019s story. Confusing Tormund as many of whom he had told the story to would either look deathly afraid, repelled, or even turned on. Not amused like Y/N was.</p><p>\u201cNow what do they call you little fox.\u201d</p><p>Y/N thought whether or not to reveal her true identity. To be trusting or to be safe. She chose the latter.</p><p>\u201cThey call me Doe.\u201d</p><p>Tormund looked at the woman in confusion.</p><p>\u201cDoe? A deer?\u201d</p><p>Ygritte laughed at Tormund\u2019s expression.</p><p>\u201cA female deer.\u201d</p><p>Tormund glared at his Wildling friend.</p><p>\u201cI know what a doe is, you fucker.\u201d</p><p>Ygritte smirked.</p><p>\u201cIt sounded like you didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>As the two bickered back and forth, walking either side of the Baratheon, Y/N could not help but reminisce of the funny quarrels between her, Robb, and Jon. She missed them both dearly. Whilst she may never be able to reunite with Robb, she knew she was so close to seeing Jon. She could feel it.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-Turns out, Y/N\u2019s feelings were correct. For the bastard of Eddard Stark was a lot closer than she thought. She had been living with the Wildlings for nearly a year when Ygritte had travelled back from her duties at the wall. \u00a0But Ygritte wasn\u2019t alone. It seemed she had turned the tables on her capture; catching the crow herself. </p><p>As Ygritte travelled back to the Wildling den with the crow, Y/N and Tormund sat at the fire. The man watching as the woman hacked and carved the elks they and other Wildlings had caught earlier that day. She had come to take position of cook the minute she arrived. Being near the fire reminded her of life back home. She had also taken up cooking whilst living with Robb; wanting to become friendly with the servants and hand maidens that she thought would be with her for life. But how she was wrong. </p><p>During her months with the Wildlings, her skills in sword fighting had become a lot stronger. Adhering the techniques of the Wildlings, the Starks, and those her uncle Jaime had taught her, made Y/N\u2019s fighting style unique. Untouchable. Her skills with an arrow had no match to anyone else either. She was a strong warrior. One the Wildlings had come to admire.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve grown strong Little Doe. Nearly as strong as I.\u201d</p><p>Y/N smiled at Tormund\u2019s words. The man reminded her of her father. His contagious laugh and rosy cheeks were similar to that of the Baratheon king. Cutting the elk into pieces, Y/N placed them onto the fire. </p><p>\u201cAnd I did not need one drop of giant\u2019s milk.\u201d</p><p>Tormund bellowed with laughter at the girl\u2019s sarcasm. She was still a spitfire. That aspect had not changed.</p><p>Y/N had come to adapt to the Wildling lifestyle very quickly. Most of it not being that different to her adventures with Jon and Robb. Hunting, sparring, and amongst other training activities. She was more comfortable here than she had ever been under the gaze of her mother. No dresses in sight. Just thick furs and weapons. Jon would have fit right in, she thought. </p><p>Wiping her hands on her trousers, Y/N stood up, handing some already cooked food to Tormund. The man began to devour the food instantly. </p><p>\u201cI am going to give the rest of this food out to the ones who have yet to eat. So, don\u2019t think about eating my plate or else the last words out of your mouth would have been about how strong I am. Got it Tor?\u201d</p><p>The man held up a thumb, shoving the rest of his forkful into his mouth. He had learnt that the young woman did not kid when it meant food was involved.</p><p>Picking up the large box of prepared food, Y/N trudged out the camp and headed towards the groups of Wildlings she had left to feed. The women and children smiled at her arrival. The men nodding their heads in respect. She began to hand out the meals; blissfully unaware of Ygritte and many other Wildlings entering the camp with Jon Snow at their side. </p><p>\u201cHey Dongo?\u201d</p><p>The giant stopped hammering the pole at the sound of his name. He smiled once he saw it was Little Doe. Even the giants had come to care for the Baratheon. Everyone treated her as though she was a born and raised Wildling.</p><p>As Y/N\u2019s attention was aimed at feeding the giant, she failed to see the crow, behind the large beast, being ushered into the main tent. Grabbing a large slab of shank out of her box, she handed the meat to the giant. </p><p>\u201cIf you want anymore, Xera is also cooking in the tent over there. You\u2019ve worked really hard today.\u201d</p><p>The giant nodded in appreciation, watching as Y/N carried on weaving through the groups of Wildlings to feed the hungry.</p><p>\u201cI smell a crow.\u201d</p><p>Tormund had ceased eating once he felt the presence of a stranger in the tent. Ygritte stood to one side of Jon, as the Lord of Bones stood at the other. The man pulling of his mask as he spoke.</p><p>\u201cWe killed his friends. Thought you&rsquo;d want to question this one.\u201d</p><p>Tormund kept his back to the trio.</p><p>\u201cWhat do we want with a baby crow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis baby killed Qhorin Halfhand. He wants to be one of us.\u201d</p><p>At Ygritte\u2019s words, Tormund stood from his seat; staring at Jon.</p><p>\u201cThat half-handed cunt killed friends of mine. Friends twice your size.\u201d</p><p>Jon took deep breaths. Trying to not show his fear.</p><p>\u201cMy father told me big men fall just as quick as little ones if you put a sword through their hearts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlenty of little men tried to put their swords through my heart. And there&rsquo;s plenty of little skeletons buried in the woods. What&rsquo;s your name, boy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJon Snow.\u201d</p><p>Tormund\u2019s face changed to one of confusion. Having remembered a time when the Little Doe had mentioned a man named Jon. No last name. But it had been one of the few times she had talked so openly of her past. Of a boy she had grown besides, who had to leave to protect the place he lived.</p><p>Jon kneeled before Tormund, mistaking him for Mance Rayder, the King-beyond-the-Wall.</p><p>\u201cYour Grace.\u201d</p><p>The wildlings laughed, Tormund ignoring his thoughts.</p><p>\u201cYour Grace? Did you hear that? From now on, you&rsquo;d better kneel every time I fart.\u201d</p><p>With the Wildlings laughing, Mance Rayder appeared from the shadows, heading towards the crow.</p><p>\u201cStand, boy. We don&rsquo;t kneel for anyone beyond the Wall.\u201d</p><p>Jon raised to his feet, watching the man before him.</p><p>\u201cSo, you&rsquo;re Ned Stark&rsquo;s bastard. Thank you for the gift, Lord of Bones. You can leave us.\u201d</p><p>The lord of Bones left, Ygritte soon following in tow. As she exited the tent, Y/N approached the woman, food already in hand. </p><p>\u201cHere you go Ygritte. Just heard you had arrived back. With company as well. Who\u2019s the poor soul this time?\u201d</p><p>Ygritte smirked at the girl\u2019s words. Much like Tormund, the girl had spoken of a Jon. But had given no name. However, with the details she had told, Ygritte knew the man in the tent was the man Y/N had spoken about. Not wanting to give anything away, Ygritte took the food from the woman. </p><p>\u201cYou know, just some crow. We killed the rest. Thought this one could be useful, He\u2019s in there with Mance and Tormund. Head in if you like.\u201d</p><p>At the end of her words, Ygritte walked away, watching from her peripheral vision as Y/N began to walk into the tent.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;As she stood outside the tent, Y/N could hear Mance Rayder and Tormund tormenting the poor crow.</p><p>\u201cThe girl likes you. You like her back, Snow? That why you want to join us?\u201d</p><p>As she quietly stepped into the tent, Y/N body became rigid at the sight of dark black curls. It couldn\u2019t be.</p><p>\u201cDon&rsquo;t panic, boy. This isn&rsquo;t the damned Night&rsquo;s Watch where we make you swear off girls.\u201d</p><p>Tormund came to stand at the entrance, his face turning to see Y/N frozen in the doorway. Concern taking over his features.</p><p>\u201cThis chicken eater you thought was king is Tormund Giantsbane.\u201d</p><p>Jon refused to turn to look at the man; only until he saw Mance Rayder\u2019s expression change as well. </p><p>The leader of the Wildling\u2019s had also seen Y/N stand in the door. Both men worried at her reaction to the sight of the crow.</p><p>\u201cLittle Doe is there something wrong?\u201d</p><p>At the sound of the name, Jon\u2019s head whipped to the direction of the door. Only one person other than Sansa that he knew was called Little Doe.</p><p>For the first time in two years, Y/N and Jon was in each other\u2019s presence. Through loss, deceit, fear, they had gone through it all and were back together again. </p><p>\u201cY/N?\u201d</p><p>Tears sprung to her eyes at the sound of her name. She never thought she would the sound of her name so much. But she missed the man that spoke them more. </p><p>\u201cJon.\u201d</p><p>As she cried his name, the man strode towards the woman. Jon pulling her body flushed against his own. Clinging to each other with all their strength. Pulling the other tighter and tighter. Afraid to be ripped apart once more.</p><p>Pulling back just enough to look into his eyes, Y/N spoke to Jon for the first time in a long while.</p><p>\u201cI came to the wall after what had happened, and I stopped to rest. But then Tormund and the Wildlings came; warned me about the dangers beyond the wall. I\u2019ve been here since. I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t save Robb and Catelyn. I\u2019m so sorry Jon.\u201d</p><p>The girl cried. The sound broke the hearts of all three men. None of the Wildlings had ever seen or heard the woman cry. They weren\u2019t aware of the terrors she had fled when they had found her. </p><p>Jon wiped away the tears. His hand cupping Y/N\u2019s face, as the other continued to hold her waist; keeping her body close. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not your fault. You are a Baratheon, not a Lannister. You did not kill them.\u201d</p><p>The young woman hiccuped.</p><p>\u201cBut I didn\u2019t save them either. I should have tried harder.\u201d</p><p>Jon held her closer, trying to sooth the woman in his arms. </p><p>\u201cBaratheon?\u201d</p><p>Y/N ceased her sobbing at the sound of Tormund\u2019s voice. </p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d</p><p>Lifting her head from Jon\u2019s chest, she kept a firm grip of the man\u2019s furs, as she turned her head to where Tormund stood next to Mance Rayder. Tormund continuing to look confused, whilst Rayder\u2019s showed no expression. </p><p>Y/N sits down with the men and begins to explain to them her story. Of how she was meant to marry Robb Stark, the events of the Red Wedding, of all the hatred she held towards her mother and siblings. </p><p>\u201cI have felt more at home here and at Winterfell than I ever did in Kingslanding. The only reason I was still there was because I am the only pure born Baratheon and I was not going to leave my father. If you wish for me to leave, I will do so. But I never intended to harm you. In anyway, and I am sorry that I lied to you both, and the others.\u201d</p><p>Mance Rayder looked at Tormund, the man staring back. Their silent conversation being recognised by Jon as he came to sit next to Y/N. His body gravitating to sit as close as he possibly could. </p><p>The two men nodded towards the other. Looking back at the girl. </p><p>Mance Rayder spoke clearly to the woman.</p><p>\u201cYou have shown through your words and actions that you are no Lannister. That you are no coward. That you are a Wildling. Through and through. The only way you could be more Wildling is if Tormund had birthed you himself.\u201d</p><p>Y/N chuckled at his words.</p><p>\u201cThat is true.\u201d Tormund agreed.</p><p>\u201cYou are one of us. That will never change.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you Rayder.\u201d</p><p>The man smiled at the young woman. Taking that as his leave, he stood from his seat and walked towards the entrance. </p><p>\u201cSnow.\u201d</p><p>Jon looked at the man standing at the door.</p><p>\u201cWe shall discuss matters of you being here at a later time.\u201d</p><p>At the end of his words, Mance Rayder left the room, leaving the trio alone.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still our Little Doe. Still unstoppable with a bow and arrow and a fucking great cook.\u201d</p><p>Jon smiled at Tormund\u2019s words to Y/N. He was proud that she had been able to survive so long in the game that was being played. Away from most of the carnage, but still aware of the fight. That she had been able to gain respect from a group that many people in Westeros never dared to fight against.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Tormund. You are still my fire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye. You better tell that to your friend.\u201d</p><p>Tormund left the pair alone in the tent. His laughter becoming quieter and quieter the further he travelled away.</p><p>Turning to face Y/N, Jon threaded his fingers through her hair. Wanting to feel her presence as much as he could. Cupping his hands with her own, Y/N leant into his touch. Glad to feel the familiar touch of the man before her. </p><p>\u201cSo, tell me about the Watch? Have you finally made some friends, besides me and your family?\u201d</p><p>Jon chortled at her words. Y/N had always teased Jon about his lack of companions when they were growing up. As Robb and Theon grew older, they had many friends and even some women at their sides. Whereas it seemed Jon was content with only having her.</p><p>\u201cA young man called Samwell Tarly. He has become a great companion of mine. But all men of the Watch are brothers in arms. We have each other\u2019s backs.\u201d</p><p>A sullen look took over Y/N\u2019s features as she pulled her face away from Jon\u2019s caress. Worry instantly took over Jon at the sudden change in her demeanour.</p><p>\u201cAnd what would they make of you here with us Wildlings?\u201d</p><p>Jon huffed out a breath; unsure how to answer. </p><p>\u201cBut you are not a Wildling.\u201d</p><p>Y/N took great offense to her friend\u2019s statement.</p><p>\u201cYou heard Mance Rayder. I am a Wildling. Through and through. The only way I could be more Wildling is if Tormund had birthed me himself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cY/N, you are a Princess of House Baratheon and Lannister. You are meant to be in a castle, safe and away from all of this.\u201d</p><p>Y/N was hurt. Jon of all people should know how much she hated her life in Kingslanding.</p><p>\u201cYou know that I have never wished to be a princess. You know that one of the reasons I travelled with father to Winterfell so often was because the horrible torment I would have faced when he had gone.\u201d</p><p>Y/N rose to her feet, as her anger began to take over her emotions. Jon regretting his words as soon as he said them. Y/N\u2019s hands slammed on the table between them. </p><p>\u201cYou know that the place I felt safest was at Winterfell and that all went when Theon betrayed your brother. When your brother betrayed his vow. When my grandfather betrayed me. Sending men to kill us all. Your brother may have died. But I had to watch one of my best friends die at the hands of my uncle. I had to run as I knew that Cateyln, the only honest and caring woman in my life, be killed. Whilst you were in Castle Black. Having no idea of the atrocities I faced.\u201d</p><p>Y/N wiped her nose, as tears pricked her eyes once more. Looking away at the man in front of her. His saddened expression making her wish she wasn\u2019t so harsh. But she could not allow him to disrespect all she had been through.<br/>\u201cThese people took me in. They could have left me to die, whilst I searched for you, but they didn\u2019t. They helped me grow as a warrior. If Ygritte and Tormund did not take me in, I would most likely be on the other side of that wall, with eyes as blue as the summer sky, and skin as cold as the ice.\u201d</p><p>Jon flinched at her words, at the idea of her being part of the dead beyond the wall. Standing from his seat, Jon strode around the table, moving to stand in front of Y/N, forcing the woman to look at him.</p><p>\u201cI am sorry. They were your family as much as they were mine. I cannot imagine the feelings you have felt. But I am here now, and I am going to make sure that you are safe.\u201d</p><p>Looking into his eyes, Y/N searched to see any lies. She loved Jon. More than she cared to admit, but they were a part of a game much bigger than the both of them, and that meant having to question the actions of those they loved. </p><p>Stepping closer, toe to toe, Jon could feel Y/N\u2019s breath on his face. His eyes momentarily closing at the feeling. </p><p>\u201cWill I be safe in Castle Black? Among the Nightswatch? Because I don\u2019t think I will.</p><p>Y/N left the room, allowing her words to linger in Jon\u2019s heart. His chest feeling heavy at the thought of Y/N feeling unsafe with him. But he knew it wasn\u2019t his presence that made her feel unsafe, but that of the Nightswatch. For as far as they, and everyone else in Westeros knew, Princess Y/N Baratheon was dead. And she was. For this new woman, sitting next to Wun Wun in the open camp, was not the same Baratheon that Jon had left in Winterfell. But Jon\u2019s heart still thumped as hard.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-</p><p>A few days after Jon\u2019s arrival at the camp, Mance Rayder ordered for Tormund to escort a group of Wildlings to attack Castle Black from the rear. Instructing Tormund to have Jon accompany him.</p><p>Tormund and the Wildlings had prepared to leave camp, when out of nowhere, Y/N appeared at Tormund\u2019s side. Cloaked and ready for the journey ahead. </p><p>\u201cYou are not coming Little Doe.\u201d</p><p>Y/N stared straight ahead, ignoring Tormund\u2019s words. </p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s right Y/N.\u201d</p><p>Jon slightly flinched at the glare she through his way.</p><p>\u201cI am still pissed off at you Snow. So, don\u2019t tell me that I would be safe at Castle Black, then tell me I cannot come with you. Because you will be proving yourself to be a liar.\u201d</p><p>Turning her head back forward, Y/N began to march forward with the Wildlings. Jon was frozen in his place. Staring as the woman walked at the front of the group, unafraid of what was out there. Turning his head, Jon realised that Tormund had ceased moving, much like Y/N, glaring at the man in question. Jon gulped. </p><p>\u201cYou better start walking crow. You\u2019ve already pissed off one Wildling today. Don\u2019t make it another.\u201d</p><p>Jon instantly began to walk, he and Tormund quickly catching up the group; situating themselves at the front once more.</p><p>It did not take long for things to go South. With Ygritte and Jon\u2019s near-death experience climbing the wall, to Jon refusing to kill the innocent man, Y/N had to step in. She may have been angry with Jon. But she was not going to watch him be killed.</p><p>\u201cTormund! Stop! You are not going to kill him.\u201d</p><p>As Y/N runs to aid Jon, Ygritte grabs her arms from behind; restraining the young woman.</p><p>\u201cYgritte if you were my friend, you would let me go.\u201d</p><p>Ygritte held on to Y/N\u2019s arms tighter.</p><p>\u201cI am not going to let you go because you are my friend, and you will make the wrong decision.\u201d</p><p>Out of nowhere, Summer and Shaggydog arrive at Jon\u2019s side. Greywind had been kept absent from the expedition due to the treacherous climbing and walking. They could not carry supplies for twenty plus Wildlings and a direwolf.</p><p>As Jon was fighting successfully against the Wildlings, with the help of the direwolves, Y/N fought excessively hard to get out of Ygritte\u2019s grip. Successfully doing so and grabbing her bow and arrow as well. Holding the arrow in the direction of Tormund and Ygritte, Y/N stepped closer towards Jon.</p><p>\u201cYou are not going to kill him!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a traitor. Still loyal to the Nightswatch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s my family and so are you. I am not losing anymore family\u2026\u201d</p><p>As Y/N held back the Wildlings, with Summer at her side, Jon successfully killed Orrell. Suddenly, an eagle swooped down to attack the man, clawing him across the face. Y/N turned at the commotion, running towards Jon, she whistled, causing a horse to approach. Placing her bow onto her back she pulled out her sword, swinging it back and forth to keep away the eagle and any approaching Wildlings.</p><p>\u201cGet on the horse now!\u201d</p><p>Jon slowly climbs onto the horse. He holds out his hand for Y/N to take. Looking sadly at the man, she ignored his hand.</p><p>\u201cOne day Jon Snow, we will see each other again.\u201d</p><p>Clapping the horse on the back leg, Y/N urged the stead to gallop away from the Wildlings. Jon watching as she was quickly restrained once more by the people she had called family. She had put herself in danger to save him. Jon would never forgive himself.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p><p>Y/N\u2019s arms were bound tightly together. Gagged to stop her screams as Tormund ordered for Ygritte and other Wildlings to chase after Jon. \u00a0She fought and fought to free herself, but she could not fight no longer. Tormund carrying Y/N himself to their base to rest. Facing forward, he dared not to look down at the woman in his arms, hearing her soft broken cries caused his heart to replace the anger he felt at her actions to change to sadness at the sound of her tearful woes.</p><p><br/>Jon cleaned his facial wounds in a small pool. His horse grazing nearby. He heard the sound of a bow being drawn, turning to see Ygritte, an arrow notched and aimed at him. Anger surges through her at the betrayal of the man. His betrayal to the Wildlings. To Y/N. Her friends.</p><p>\u201cYgritte, you know I didn&rsquo;t have a choice. \u00a0She always knew what I was. What I am. I have to go home now. I know you won&rsquo;t hurt me. Y/N wouldn\u2019t want you to hurt me.\u201d</p><p>Ygritte\u2019s hold on the bow began to loosen.</p><p>\u201cYou know nothing, Jon Snow. You know nothing of what you and her family have put her through.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do know some things. I know I love her.\u201d</p><p>Ygritte grunted, drawing her bow harder in rage.</p><p>\u201cI have loved her since we were children. I loved her when her father told her she was meant to marry my brother. I loved her when I left for the Watch. And I love her now. Through all she has been through. I love who she was and who she has become.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why did you betray her. Why did you betray us?\u201d</p><p>Jon paused with his words. Staring deep into Ygritte\u2019s eyes, seeing the blinding rage that she held towards him.</p><p>\u201cI have to make things right. To make it better for her.\u201d</p><p>Ygritte fought back tears at the thought of Jon taking away her friend. But also, for the fact he was leaving her once more. \u00a0Jon turned around, unaware, as Ygritte loosened an arrow into his shoulder. Jon fell to the ground, grunting in pain. \u00a0Notching another arrow, Ygritte watched as Jon lurched up and grabbed onto his horse. She hesitated. Not wanting to hurt him more than she had. He was right. Y/N would not want her to do this. But she had to.</p><p>Jon mounted his steed as Ygritte shot an arrow into his leg; crying out as he spurred on his horse. With her anger rising once more, Ygritte shot her third and final arrow, lodging it into the crow\u2019s back. If he were a target, it would be right on the bullseye. Cursing as she let the man gallop away.</p><p>When Ygritte arrived back to camp, her quiver empty, but no Jon in sight, Y/N wasn\u2019t sure if she had successfully killed the man and left him to other creatures beyond the wall, or if she had let him go. </p><p>Y/N sat next to Tormund, arms still secured behind her back. Her face void of any emotion. Ygritte went to walk past the woman but halted as words left the princess\u2019 mouth.</p><p>\u201cDid you kill him? If you were my friend, you could at least tell me that.\u201d</p><p>Ygritte looked at her friend, bound and sat on the floor. Like a slave. Like a prisoner. Nothing like one of their own. She hated to see her like this. But they had to be careful.</p><p>\u201cI did what I had to do.\u201d</p><p>Ygritte walked away from the woman, ignoring as her hunched shoulders went slack. Y/N no longer had the will to fight. Jon had betrayed her, the Wildlings had betrayed her, and she had betrayed them as well.</p><p>Y/N was kept detained for the time that the Wildlings prepared to invade the Black. Even though she had fought against them, Tormund and the Wildlings still cared for her. Becoming increasingly worried as she refused to speak and eat. All day and all night, she sat shackled, watching them prepare with a blank stare. Tormund could not deal with it no more. </p><p>Moving to sit next to the distant woman, Tormund dropped to the ground with a loud thud. Bringing a canter to her lips, he forced her to swallow.</p><p>\u201cYou are not dying because of that traitor, Little Doe. I understand why you did what you did. We forgive you.\u201d</p><p>Y/N shook her head at his words.</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t. I protected him. I haven\u2019t seen him for years, but the moment he goes against him, I was by his side. I turned against you when I should have stopped him.\u201d</p><p>Tormund drank from the canter, staring into the distant hills. The air was cold, but not as harsh as it had been before.</p><p>\u201cBut we do forgive you. People do all kinds of things for love.\u201d</p><p>Y/N scoffed.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t love him. Not anymore.\u201d</p><p>Tormund couldn\u2019t help but smile at the woman\u2019s malice filled words.</p><p>\u201cYes, you do Little Doe. You love him, and he loves you. Through all the changes and things that have done you wrong, you love each other. Between you, there is fire, scorching hot fire. It cannot be put out. But it can be made stronger.\u201d</p><p>Y/N processed Tormund\u2019s words. </p><p>Tormund left the woman to think. She knew of the raids that had occurred in the towns. Having been kept behind and guarded by a group of Wildlings as they had occurred. She knew that the siege of Castle Black was to occur that night. She had to prove to her Wildling family that she could be trusted. That she has always been and will be a Wildling.</p><p>Rolling onto her back, Y/N pushed herself forward, flipping onto her feet. Bending her knees to get used to the feeling of standing once more, Y/N casually strolled through the Wildlings and towards Mance Rayder and Tormund and they spoke with numerous wildlings about the battle that was about to commence.</p><p>Slowing to stand beside Tormund, she listens to the conversation. Hearing the plan of action, Y/N nods her head.</p><p>\u201cOkay, if someone can untie me, I\u2019ll grab my weapons and get prepared.\u201d<br/>Tormund jumped at the new presence, unaware of the woman at his side.</p><p>\u201cYou are not coming.\u201d</p><p>Y/N turned her gaze to Mance, the man\u2019s steely eyes piercing her own.</p><p>Determined, Y/N easily pulled her hands free from her restraints. </p><p>Tormund looked between her hands and the girls face.</p><p>\u201cYou could have freed yourself? You could have escaped.\u201d</p><p>Y/N kept her gaze on Mance Rayder.</p><p>\u201cBut I didn\u2019t because I had to pay for what I did. I still do. Let me kill those bastards who changed the man I knew. The Jon I knew would never have lied of his word. He is probably dead now anyway. I will have to come to terms with that. So, Mance Rayder, please allow me to fight. To fight for the Wildlings.\u201d</p><p>Y/N knew he was alive. She knew Ygritte had not successfully killed him. The woman had overheard her words to Tormund. Her shots were calculated to hurt no kill. But Y/N had to, for once in her life, fight for family.</p><p>The man stayed quiet, the Wildlings around them waited for his reply, Ygritte, who was amongst the crowd, watched in anticipation. </p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Y/N\u2019s determined look fell.</p><p>\u201cYou will not fight for the Wildlings. You will fight with the Wildlings. With your family.\u201d</p><p>A cheer broke out amongst the camp. Y/N beamed with a smile. She was not going to disappoint them again. Not this time.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-</p><p>In Castle Black, Jon and his men prepared for the battle. Jon hoped that Y/N would not be there. That she would not fight. But he knew, that if the Wildlings had forgiven her, that he would see her right at Tormund\u2019s side. The battle could see the end of them both before they had even begun. <br/>A horn was blown. The crows stood their stance, ready to fight. But then another horn was blown, and Jon knew, that she was there, ready to fight as well. </p><p>Swords were swung, and arrows were flown. Blood from both sides was spilled and bodies of brave men and Wildling women fell. Jon was right, Y/N never left Tormund\u2019s side, hacking and slashing all Nightsmen that came in their way. Taking a hit here and there, she entered the castle with Tormund, infiltrating from the inside.</p><p>Jon had just killed Styr when Ygritte had caught his attention. Her bow and arrow aimed at the Northern man. She slowly began to lower her bow.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s inside with Tormund. Get to her.\u201d</p><p>Jon nodded, going to thank Ygritte, when he felt the arrow fly past. Watching as it embedded into Ygritte\u2019s chest. He ran to her, clutching her body as her breaths became shallow.</p><p>\u201cJon Snow. Look after her. You love her, and she loves you.\u201d</p><p>Jon clutched Ygritte. He had made a friend in the sarcastic Wildling and he knew Y/N loved the woman as a sister.</p><p>\u201cNo Ygritte, she needs us both. She needs you.\u201d</p><p>Ygritte struggled for one last breath.</p><p>\u201cYou know nothing Jon Snow. She needs you more.\u201d</p><p>As the words left Ygritte\u2019s lips, her body went limp in Jon\u2019s arms. The man watched as Olly continued to fight. The bow still in his hands. Jon quickly carried Ygritte\u2019s body to a safe space, covering her up. Taking a breath, he turned to the castle, heading in the direction he had briefly seen Tormund run.</p><p>Tormund and Y/N were back to back, fighting off the guards that crowded them. They had heard the cheers of the Nights watch. But they were not giving up. Y/ was not giving up. Tormund had two arrows embedded into his back, and Y/N\u2019s left arm had taken a deep cut from one of the swords. Another scar to add to the rest. It was two Wildlings against many more crows.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s over. Let it end.\u201d</p><p>The pair looked to see Jon, deflated and broken. </p><p>\u201cThis is how a man ends.\u201d</p><p>As Tormund raised his sword, clashing it with one of the men of the Watch, Y/N\u2019s eyes widened in shock as she saw Jon reach for the cross bow. Aiming for Tormund\u2019s leg, Jon released the arrow. The arrow hit where Jon aimed. However, it was not embedded in Tormund\u2019s leg, but in Y/N\u2019s left leg. </p><p>Jon looks on, masking in horror, walking to kick Tormund to the ground. </p><p>Y/N\u2019s own legs collapsed from underneath her. The pain and exhaustion taking over.</p><p>\u201cPut him in chains, we will question him later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou hurt her any fucking more than you have, I will slice your throat boy.\u201d</p><p>Two crows did as Jon instructed. Tormund screaming as they dragged him away.</p><p>Jon turned to leave.</p><p>\u201cWhat about the girl?\u201d</p><p>Y/N glared at Jon. Her breaths heavy and long.</p><p>He could not risk her any harm. If he gave her leverage, then they could both be harmed.</p><p>\u201cPatch her up and take her to the cells.\u201d</p><p>Before they could grab a hold of her, Y/N pulled the arrow from her leg, throwing the object to the ground </p><p>She stood, allowing the soldiers to pull her hands behind her back.</p><p>\u201cLock me away, but I a not having your filthy feathered hands touch me. I would rather bleed out. You\u2019ve changed Jon Snow. This game. This war. It changed all of us. Some for good and some for bad.\u201d</p><p>Jon gulped down the tears. Hurt from her words. </p><p>\u201cI SHOULD HAVE DIED WITH THEM. BUT HE SENT ME TO FIND YOU. TO BE SAFE. AND LOOK WHAT FINDING YOU DID TO ME!</p><p>Jon knew she referred to his brother and Catelyn. Even though she was being locked away, she still kept her identity a secret; knowing it would harm his position. He would have been killed for hurting her. Hurting the Baratheon princess. But she would have rather died a Wildling than lived longer as a noble.</p><p>The crows held her tighter, escorting her the same way that Tormund had been led.</p><p>Jon did not move until he could see her no more. Only then did he leave for his chambers. Preparing for the next step. Though she hated him, he was doing this all for her. He hoped that it would work.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-</p><p>Whilst laying in their cells, Tormund and Y/N had been made aware of Ygritte\u2019s death. Screams and cries were heard from Tormund for days on end; for his fallen family. When men walked past Y/N\u2019s cell, they heard silence. Only Tormund heard the quiet cries at night. His own tears erupting once more. Crying for Ygritte and for the pain they both felt. She apologised over and over, and Tormund reassured her over and over again. It was not her fault. </p><p>Jon was soon named the 998th Lord Commander. The wildlings below unaware of their leader\u2019s death and to position Jon was going to take of asking for their help. During their time\u2019s in the cells, Y/N had become dormant. Hardly eating, sleeping, talking, or doing anything at all. Detached from all that was surrounding her. </p><p>When Jon came to free Tormund and herself, to help travel and save the remaining Wildlings. Jon had unsuccessfully tried to speak to Y/N; the girl simply ignoring him as she had everyone else. They were all worried for her health. </p><p>\u201cShe is too ill to travel.\u201d</p><p>Tormund glanced at the woman in the cell, debating Jon\u2019s words.</p><p>\u201cIf she has to stay in this hell hole, at least get that large friend of yours to help her health.\u201d</p><p>Jon nodded his head. </p><p>Walking to Y/N\u2019s cell, Jon crouched at the gates. The woman stared blankly at the floor. She seemed lifeless, but the expanding of her chest proved otherwise.</p><p>\u201cI know I have changed. We both have. But I am doing this all for you. So, you can have the life you deserve. Away from all this shit that has happened. You cannot die. You did not die then, and you won\u2019t now. So, for once, you are staying here, and you are going to accept help. Samwell we come down to get you better and keep you company. I wish I could home you in proper chambers, but they would kill you if I did. We will be back soon.\u201d</p><p>Y/N slowly lifted her head as Jon spoke. Taking in his words. The two stared at each other in silence. Her eyes flickered to Tormund\u2019s figure.</p><p>\u201cKeep him safe Torm. Keep yourself safe too.\u201d</p><p>Tormund smiled, glad to hear his Little Doe speak again. He had missed her voice. </p><p>\u201cAye,I am a Giantsbane. We will be all right. Ain\u2019t that right boy?\u201d</p><p>Jon nodded, still holding his gaze on Y/N. Even as they left the dungeons, the man never wavered his look from her. He saw her lie on the floor as they left. Falling to sleep.</p><p>Jon informed Samwell of his commands, making sure that he kept it private between the two. He did not want anyone else to question why she was having assistance. Samwell took the orders with no hesitation or question. Instantly going into action, the minute that Jon and the other Wildlings left.</p><p>Everyday Sam would force Y/N to eat and drink. Checking her wounds, bringing her fresh furs and even cleaning her own. Doing all he could to make sure she became healthy again. For a while, it was only Sam talking to fill up the silence. He spoke of his life before the watch, to his opinions on pointless things, to information of the houses. Y/N hid her amusement when he recited the history of House Baratheon to the woman. Still unaware of who she was. To him, she was a Wildling with hardly a clue of the history of the houses. Of what had occurred within the kingdoms. Or so she thought. Samwell was a smart man. Smarter than he looked.</p><p>\u201cJon told me stories of when King Robert and Princess Y/N Baratheon would visit Winterfell. Of how close he was to the princess.\u201d</p><p>Y/N\u2019s ears perked up at Sam\u2019s words. Clearing her throat, she spoke to the young man for the first time.</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of stories?\u201d</p><p>To say Sam was shocked was an understatement. </p><p>\u201cWell, he spoke of how they met and all the trouble they caused with his brother, Robb. Of how devastated he was when he heard that King Robert and Eddard Stark had agreed for her to marry his brother. How it confirmed his reasoning of joining the watch.\u201d</p><p>Y/N pulled the thin blanket around her tighter. Her frame had become similar to how it was before, but she still did not fit her furs as she did before. </p><p>\u201cIf the betrothal had not been agreed then he would have stayed in Winterfell?\u201d</p><p>Sam nodded.</p><p>\u201cPrecisely.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThat bastard. He left because of Robb and I. He knew I never loved him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew it.\u201d</p><p>Y/N froze at Sam\u2019s explanation. All this time she had been able to hide who she was, and this oaf had reeled it out of her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the princess.\u201d</p><p>Y/N drank from the cup at her side. Placing it back down, she leaned her head on the concrete wall, turning to look at Sam, who sat on the other side of the bars. On a stool, holding his own drink.</p><p>\u201cWell, you going to kill me? Sell me for ransom and bribery?\u201d</p><p>Sam shook his head in a comical manner. The girl quirked an eyebrow. From the time he had spent tending to her, she had come to realise that Samwell\u2019s actions were pure. But she could not help but pull up her guard.</p><p>\u201cI wold never. I had my suspicions when Jon asked me to tend to you that you meant something to him. But it was not until you began to eat once more, and your face began to fill out, that I recognised your features. You look very different to your siblings yet so much like your mother and father. You have her beauty and his dark hair and eyes.\u201d</p><p>It had been a long time since Y/N had heard of her father or had been compared to him. She ignored the comments of her siblings and Cersei. But to hear that someone could recognise her as her father\u2019s child made her smile once more. <br/>\u201cJon asked me to look after you. And that I will. I will do anything to make Princess Y/N Baratheon better once more.\u201d</p><p>Sam\u2019s words brought tears to Y/N\u2019s eyes. Not of sadness or pain like she had cried for the times that have passed. But tears of gratitude. She felt for the first time, in a long time, happy to hear her name. To hear her father\u2019s house and her name together. Even through all she had fought, Y/N truly believed her father would have been proud.</p><p>By the time that Jon, Tormund and many of the Wildlings had returned, Y/N was better and nearly stronger than ever. Sam had successfully convinced to be placed on full time guard duty of the Wildling woman. Helping her repair and get better. Sam confided in Y/N of his desires to become a maester. The woman encouraged him to do so, reminding him to not forget about Gilly and the child he has come to love as his own.</p><p>Sam travelled to library, where Jon sat, waiting for the news of Y/N\u2019s condition.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s better. She eats well, sleeps well, talks quite a lot.\u201d</p><p>Jon let out a small chuckle. Remembering of all the times she talked his ears off growing up.</p><p>Sam relied all of her improvements. Before mentioning his desires to leave. To become a maester. Remembering both Gilly and Y/N\u2019s encouraging words.</p><p>Jon stared at Sam, saying nothing.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be more use to you as a Maester. More use to everyone now that Maester Aemon\u2019s gone. The Citadel has the world\u2019s greatest library. I\u2019ll learn about history, strategy, healing. And other things. Things that will help when they come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf Gilly stays here then she\u2019ll die. And the baby that she named after me will die. And I\u2019ll end up dying, too, trying to protect them. Which means that the last thing that I\u2019ll see in this world will be the look in her eyes when I fail them. (pause) I\u2019d rather see a thousand White Walkers than see that.\u201d</p><p>Jon inhaled and exhaled. Nodding somberly, allowing Sam to go.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>The men continued to discuss Sam\u2019s relationship with Gilly and what it would mean for him to become a maester.</p><p>They sit in silence for a moment.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll come back. You\u2019re not my only friend anymore. I have you and Princess Y/N to visit.\u201d</p><p>Jon\u2019s head whipped up at Sam\u2019s words. </p><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d</p><p>Sam smiled faintly. </p><p>\u201cAll the times you spoke of her, `and how you were so adamant of a particular Wildlings safety rang bells in my mind. Then when she was getting better, she looked more Baratheon every day. I asked, and she replied. Told me all that had happened since she was reported dead. Well, since your brother passed.\u201d</p><p>Jon looked towards the doors. Pondering on whether to leave to see her. He had been wanting to since he arrived. No doubt Tormund had already re-laid all that had happened, to her.</p><p>\u201cGo. She may act like she does not want to see you. But she does. She spoke the most when your name was brought up in conversation.\u201d</p><p>Jon stood from his seat, bringing his friend into a hug. </p><p>\u201cTo you return.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo my return.\u201d</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-<br/>Jon travelled to the cells where Y/N still stayed. Without an explanation, he unlocked the door. If the rest of the Wildlings were roaming around Castle Black, so should she. </p><p>Startled at the sudden noise, Y/N sat up from her position on the ground. Watching with baited breath as Jon yanked open the metal bars. Her time in the cells, and with Samwell, had left her hours to think long and hard about how she felt. How she felt about the game. How she felt about friends. How she felt about Jon. And how she felt about herself. She did not want to become a bitter woman. Y/N knew that Jon was doing what he thought was right. He always had. The man may have caused her pain and sorrow. But he was her best friend. He was her Jon.</p><p>Jon bent down to sit near Y/N, leaning his back against the wall, he left space between them. Trying to show that he did not want to over step any boundaries. </p><p>Without a word, Y/N scooted closer to Jon, so that their arms touched. Neither moved their gazes from the wall in front of them. Slowly, Y/N laid her head on his shoulder. </p><p>The pair sat there in silence for a long period of time. Basking in the shared company. It had been the first time in years that Jon and Y/N had been able to sit together, without talking about what had happened to them or what was going to happen next.</p><p>Ever so gently, Jon placed his right hand over Y/N\u2019s left. Interlocking their fingers, he stroked the back of the woman\u2019s hand. Basking in the small pieces of affection. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re back.\u201d</p><p>Jon smiled at her words. He was not sure if Sam\u2019s words were true. If she still cared for him.</p><p>\u201cSo am I. You can wonder freely around the castle now. You can share my chambers, if you would like. I know you don\u2019t feel relatively safe amongst the other men of the Watch.\u201d</p><p>Y/N pondered his invitation. Snuggling closer to Jon, she tightened her hold on his hand.</p><p>\u201cYeah. I would appreciate that a lot Jon. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would do anything to keep you safe.\u201d</p><p>Y/N tilted her head to stare into Jon\u2019s own eyes. Entranced by the other, their bodies moved closer together. Y/N laying practically on top of Jon.</p><p>\u201cAnd so, would I.\u201d</p><p>They stayed in the cells for the rest of the night. Enjoying the silence and each other\u2019s company. Cuddled in an embrace, Y/N and Jon fell asleep, wrapped around each other.</p><p>What they had been unaware of was little Olly slowly creeping down the cellar during their moment. Seeing his Lord Commander spread across the Wildling woman made the lads blood boil. He had lost his family, his village, his home, all to those foul monsters. And now the watch had lost their leader. A traitor. That is what Jon Snow was.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-And a traitor\u2019s death Jon was given. Sitting in his chambers, Y/N had left mere minutes earlier to speak to Tormund about increasing her training once more, now that she had been healed better. Jon\u2019s face was still flushed from the surprising kiss on the cheek from the woman. The unexpected affection causing the colour to travel across his face. </p><p>It soon disappeared when Olly quickly knocked on his chamber door, breathlessly explaining to Jon how Y/N had fallen down the steps when rushing to find Tormund. How she had heard a crack and could not move her right leg. Jon quickly left his chambers, following Olly who told him that Thorne was with the woman, who had refused any help unless Jon was there.</p><p>But what Jon had arrived to was not Y/N on the ground in pain with Thorne at her side. But Y/N held captive by Thorne; surrounded by members of the watch. The woman was gagged and shackled. The same she had been when the Wildlings lost the Battle of Castle Black.</p><p>Jon sees the woman crying. Turning to ask Thorne what the meaning of this all was, before Jon\u2019s words could leave his mouth, Thorne plunged a knife into his stomach. Y/N\u2019s screams ringing loud, even with the gag in her mouth. </p><p>With a hand on his stomach, Jon quickly manouvered to reach the woman. The loss of blood causing him to stumble. Just before he could reach her, Yarwyck, Marsh and two other black brothers proceed to stab Jon. Each dedicating their action \u2018For the Watch.\u2019 Jon dropped to his knees, swaying as he watched Y/n thrash against the men who held her captive. Her gag falling loose.</p><p>\u201cStop. Stop it now!\u201d</p><p>Thorne moved to stand behind Y/N, his dagger held tightly to her throat. When she gulped, she could feel the blade digging into her neck. </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t hurt her. She did nothing wrong.\u201d</p><p>Thorne sneered at Jon.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a Wildling. Everything she does is wrong.\u201d</p><p>Blood soaked Jon\u2019s armour. </p><p>\u201cShe is Princess Y/N Baratheon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am a Wildling. Born and bred.\u201d</p><p>Jon looked into Y/N\u2019s eyes. Tears falling from both his and her own.</p><p>If he was going to die, she was not going to let him save her. She was not going to allow the title she despised to kill the man she loved and save her life.</p><p>And as Olly laid down the final blow, stabbing Jon in the heart, the last thing he saw was was Thorne, a man he had come to respect and follow, slice the blade across Y/N\u2019s neck. </p><p>Their bodies falling to the ground simultaneously. Neither breathing. Neither alive. The blood poring out their bodies, and down the small dips in the snow, connecting the two puddles together. Even in death, Y/N and Jon were connected.</p><p>With a sign above Jon\u2019s head, labelling him a traitor, and a sign above Y/N\u2019s labelling her a savage. The men of the watch dismembered, leaving the bodies to be found in the morning.</p><p>And as the pair lay dead, Greywind and Ghost howled to the air, alerting Davos, Edd and his men about the bodies that laid in the snow. The group quickly bringing them into their quarters, with Greywind and Ghost protecting the door. </p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have the numbers.\u201d</p><p>Edd looked at Davos in contemplation.</p><p>\u201cWe have two direwolves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not enough. I didn\u2019t know Lord Commander Snow for long, but I have to believe he wouldn\u2019t have wanted his friends to die for nothing. Speaking for Princess Y/N Baratheon, those men have killed an heir to the throne. Our Lord Commander\u2019s partner. Our friend in arms. She will not die for nothing.&ldquo;</p><p>\u201cIf you were planning to see tomorrow, you picked the wrong room. We all die today. I say we do our best to take Thorne with us when we go.\u201d</p><p>Davos began to feel frustrated at Edd\u2019s words.</p><p>\u201cWe need to fight, but we don\u2019t need to die. Not if we have help.\u201d</p><p>The men in the room murmured amongst them.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s gonna help us?\u201d questioned one of the Nightswatch. </p><p>Davos looked across the faces in the room.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not the only ones who owe your lives to Jon Snow. Once they find out one of their own has been killed, they will come fighting and swinging. For Y/N may have been a princess, but she has a wilder family that lay closer to her heart.\u201d</p><p>Realisation swept over Edd. He turned to the Night\u2019s Watchman at his side.</p><p>\u201cBolt the door. Don\u2019t let anyone in. I\u2019ll be back as soon as I can.\u201d</p><p>Edd exited the room. The man swiftly and quietly left the room, heading down the halls and out the castle to the man who could help them. For now, they needed the help of the Wildlings.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-Ash. All she could see was ash covering the grounds of Kingslanding. Of her home. The sound of screams and burning fire growing louder by the second. As the screams become louder, her vision started to blur. With the Red Keep in the distance falling to the ground; fire encompassing the building. Just before the darkness took over, Y/N heard a single word, over the screams and the terrifying sound of burning. As clear as day, a single word; Dracarys.</p><p>Y/N gasped as her eye\u2019s shot open. Taking in the cold and chilly air around her, it quickly came to Y/N\u2019s attention how exposed she was. Feeling a nudging of her hand, Y/N turned her head to see Greywind at the side of the pillar in which she laid. A blanket held softly between his teeth. </p><p>Slowly sitting up, Y/N took the blanket from the direwolf, wrapping it around herself securely. Her body felt extremely cold; like a corpse. How could she be alive? Jon\u2019s men stabbed her. Looking down to her stomach, Y/N could see the angry red scars of where her stab wounds were. The last thing she remembered, before her dream, was Olly killing Jon. </p><p>Jon? Was he alive or dead? Y/N had no idea. As she began to panic, air leaving her lungs at a rapid pace, the door of the room creaked open. Twisting her head to look at the figure, she watched as Tormund stood in the doorway in shock. </p><p>\u201cTormund.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLittle Doe!\u201d</p><p>The man rushed into the room. Coming to help Y/N as she weakly stood from the pillar. Engulfing his arms around the small woman, she went to hug him back. Until she remembered her exposed state.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m kind of naked Tormund, so I cannot really reciprocate.\u201d</p><p>Tormund squeezed the Baratheon princess harder before letting go.</p><p>\u201cIt is only skin Little Doe. You are as naked as the day you were born. You should feel powerful.\u201d</p><p>The woman laughed.</p><p>\u201cI feel as though I was stabbed multiple times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because you were.\u201d</p><p>At the sound of the new voice, Y/N watched as Melisandre entered through the doors. The dark red head gracefully walked through the doors and travelled to stand next to Tormund. </p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s the witch that brought you and Jon back. I always say those kissed by fire had special powers.\u201d</p><p>Tormund laughed at his own words. </p><p>Y/N could not help the shock in her body. She had died and been brought back to life. But so, had Jon.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Jon? I want to see Jon.\u201d</p><p>Tormund ceased his laughter at Y/N\u2019s desperate pleas. </p><p>\u201cI will get him for you.\u201d</p><p>Tormund gave the woman another comforting hug. </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry Little Doe. He\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>Releasing Y/N, Tormund headed to the door. Leaving the two women in the room alone. </p><p>Y/N felt the red witches gaze on her body. Pulling the blanket tighter around her, she felt Greywind move closer; sensing his owner\u2019s discomfort.</p><p>\u201cYou hold great power.\u201d</p><p>Y/N looked towards the woman. Confusion written across her expression. </p><p>Melisandre stepped closer to the Baratheon.</p><p>\u201cPower so pure that mystic creatures will fall at your feet in awe. That even the darkest of heart will not be able to hurt.\u201d</p><p>The pair stared at each other in silence until the door opened once more. This time it was Jon who would walk through. </p><p>\u201cY/N.\u201d</p><p>Hearing her name from his mouth brought tears to her eyes. The images of seeing him stabbed by the men of the watch tumbled through her mind.</p><p>\u201cJon.\u201d</p><p>She sobbed as the man rushed through the doorway and encircled his arms around her body. </p><p>As Jon held Y/N, Melisandre exited the room. Her words hanging heavily in Y/N\u2019s soul. She could not think of them now. Because Jon was alive. They were both alive. </p><p>Y/N rose her arms, to encircle them around Jon, when she suddenly realised again, she was exposed. </p><p>\u201cJon, I would love to reciprocate this hug, but I am naked.\u201d</p><p>The man instantly let go. A blush covering his entire face and neck. He turned to see a set of clothes on the chair closest to the door. Quickly grabbing them, he handed them to the woman. Turning, once again, to face away as she began to dress.</p><p>Once she was fully dressed, Y/N walked towards the Stark bastard, wrapping her arms around his torso. Spinning in her hold, placed his arms onto her waist.</p><p>\u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d</p><p>The girl winced at his question.</p><p>\u201cSore. Tired. Probably the same as you. How long have you been alive again for?\u201d</p><p>Jon looked at the ceiling, thinking of all that had happened since he had awoken. </p><p>\u201cA while. We thought you weren\u2019t going to awaken. I\u2019ve dealt with Olly and the men who did this to us.\u201d</p><p>Y/N nodded her head, silently glad she was not present for the execution. </p><p>\u201cAnd I have handed over Castle Black to Edd.\u201d</p><p>Now that surprised her. </p><p>Looking up at the man, she could not formulate words. </p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause the Watch is not my home. We are going to take back Winterfell. Take back our home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou, I, and Sansa.\u201d</p><p>Y/N placed her arms on Jon\u2019s shoulders, staring her friend in the eyes. </p><p>\u201cSansa\u2019s here?\u201d</p><p>Jon grabbed onto Y/N\u2019s hand, guiding her through the halls ever so slowly. The woman still getting used to the feeling of being alive once more. Her headache slowly dissipating and her legs becoming sturdier. Turning around the corner, Jon opened a door to a dining hall. The room full of many unfamiliar faces eating, and a few familiar ones.</p><p>Jon lead Y/N to the table which seated Sansa, Tormund, Edd, Brienne, and Podrick. All of their heads turning to the commotion of the pair entering the room. Murmurs becoming louder as many men of the watch saw Y/N alive. Much like their Lord Commander, brought back from the dead for a reason.</p><p>Sansa stood from her seat at the site of the Baratheon princess. All of them being informed of what had happened to her and Jon. For the more days had passed, the more they thought she would not return.</p><p>Letting go of Jon\u2019s hand, Y/N embraced the young Stark woman; glad to see she had survived her tormented family.</p><p>\u201cI am sorry for what that cunt Joffrey did to your father; and to you.\u201d</p><p>Sansa grasped Y/N tighter.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I survived. And the moment was splendid. But I had to leave as quickly as I could. Joffrey has been the smallest of my troubles thus far.\u201d</p><p>Sansa pulled Y/N to sit down, with Jon moving to sit at her other side. </p><p>Y/N looked in front of her to the unfamiliar pair. However, one was more unfamiliar than the other.</p><p>\u201cPodrick Payne?\u201d</p><p>Startled, Podrick looked to the young woman. </p><p>\u201cYes, m\u2019lady?\u201d</p><p>Y/N let out a cheerful laugh.</p><p>\u201cMy god. You\u2019re alive. And you\u2019re no longer attached to my uncle\u2019s side. What happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was trailed for treason m\u2019lady. For Joffrey\u2019s murder. He did not do it. But he did not want me to be brought down with him, so he handed me to Brienne of Tarth.\u201d</p><p>Y/N looked to the woman at his side. Amazement beaming in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou were sworn to the kingsguard of my uncle Renly.\u201d</p><p>Brienne looked surprise at the amazement on the princess\u2019 face and at her knowledge.</p><p>\u201cThat is right m\u2019lady.\u201d</p><p>Y/N smirked at the woman.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need to be shocked. I made sure I knew everyone who was associated with my family. Even after I left Kingslanding and Winterfell. I still found my ways to know. The only reason I don\u2019t know now is because I died.\u201d</p><p>The table went awkwardly silent. </p><p>Y/N rolled her eyes.</p><p>\u201cLighten up. I am alive aren\u2019t I. You will need to tell me everything later. I need to know it all. I am just glad that everyone here is safe. I do hope Arya, Bran and Rickon have survived as well.\u201d</p><p>Sansa looked towards Jon.</p><p>\u201cThe Bolton\u2019s have Rickon.\u201d</p><p>Anger surged through Y/N\u2019s veins. It seemed that this war would never end. </p><p>\u201cWe will get him back, I promise. We will get back Winterfell, we will find Bran and Arya, and we will end this war.\u201d </p><p>Determination laced the Baratheon\u2019s tone. The group startled at the woman\u2019s words. But slowly, one by one, they raised their glasses, ready to fight for this battle.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-<br/>A battle is what they fought victoriously against Ramsay Bolton and his men. Y/N refused to stand a side; fighting on the battle field. With Podrick and Brienne having travelled to Riverrun at the command of Sansa, Y/N made sure to protect Sansa with all her might. Even escorting her to the dungeons as she unleashed the hounds onto Ramsay. Watching from the side as the man who had defiled her friend, die at the paws of his hounds. </p><p>Y/N watched on as Jon named Sansa the Lady of Winterfell. She watched on as Jon was claimed King of the North. But she refused to watch on as Jon prepared to leave for Dragonstone to meet the Khaleesi.</p><p>\u201cI am coming with you and that is final. My uncle is alive. He sent the letter. I want to see him, and I am not leaving you.\u201d</p><p>Jon raised his head to the sky, becoming quickly frustrated with the woman in front of him.</p><p>\u201cWhat happens if this goes south?\u201d</p><p>Y/N huffed at the man in front of her, crossing her arms.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re in the North, wherever we go will go South. Except for Castle Black, and we\u2019ve only just come back from there.\u201d</p><p>Jon was not in the mood for her smart mouth. </p><p>The pair continued to bicker, unaware of those that watched on.</p><p>\u201cThis sounds familiar.\u201d</p><p>Sansa giggled at Tormund\u2019s words, having heard a similar conversation occur multiple times between the pair.</p><p>\u201cThis was my life before we left. If they were not causing trouble for each other, they were causing trouble for everyone else. Usually with Robb beside them.\u201d</p><p>Tormund nodded his head. </p><p>\u201cAnd he still has not admitted his love for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Neither has she for him.\u201d</p><p>Sansa could not help but scoff at the duo\u2019s ideocracy.</p><p>\u201cJon I am not letting you leave again. We are both alive for a reason.\u201d</p><p>Jon grasped the woman\u2019s shoulder with his right hand. Bending his head slightly so that they were eye level.</p><p>\u201cAnd I want to keep you alive. That is why you are not coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWatch me.\u201d</p><p>Before she could even try to walk away, Y/N was yanked back by Jon. Being pulled flush against his chest as his lips slammed into her own.</p><p>Sansa and Tormund looked on in surprise.</p><p>\u201cWe spoke too soon.\u201d</p><p>Y/N moved her hands to tangle into Jon\u2019s hair. His own hand\u2019s gravitating towards her lower waist. The lips locked in a passionate embrace; exerting years of pent up emotion. Love, frustration, desire, sadness, and more rolled into this one action between the pair. Their lungs begging for air as they simultaneously broke the kiss. The space between their bodies not moving an inch. Both their chests heaved for breath. Y/N biting her swollen lip as Jon\u2019s lust filled gaze stared into her own.</p><p>\u201cThat was long overdue.\u201d</p><p>Jon chuckled at Y/N\u2019s words.</p><p>\u201cI would say so.\u201d</p><p>In her peripheral vision, Y/N could see Sansa smirking at the pair with Tormund at her side; a beaming smile on the man\u2019s face. </p><p>Shaking her head, with a smile permanently fixed, Y/N gazed at the man in front of her. </p><p>\u201cI am coming with you. A kiss like that gives me even more reasons to be at your side. Don\u2019t want you falling in love with this Dragon Queen, now do I?\u201d</p><p>Jon groaned, throwing his head back at the woman\u2019s words; continuing to over react as it caused the woman he loved to laugh.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>With her hands still in his hair, Y/N pulled his head back to her own. Their foreheads leaning on one another. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not getting rid of me again Jon Snow.\u201d</p><p>Jon smiled back at Y/N.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t intend to.\u201d</p><p>Y/N simply smiled back.</p><p>Hopping aboard the boat with Jon and Davos, the trio prepared to set sail to Dragonstone. To meet the Queen of Dragons and to take the next step in the Game of Thrones.\u00a0</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-<br/>The trio sailed for weeks before they arrived. Y/N and Jon having become like their younger selves once more. Causing mischief for one another and for Davos. The man could not believe his eyes; seeing the Baratheon princess and the Stark bastard act so care free. He let them be, for once they would arrive to Dragonstone, all carefree antics would be out the window once more. </p><p>Looking into the crystal blue waters, Y/N breathed in the crisp see air. Jon moving to stand behind her, his hands encircling her waist as he laid his chin on her shoulder. </p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve survived this far. Do you think we will make it home?\u201d</p><p>Y/N\u2019s words were serious and deeply questioning. She wasn\u2019t sure herself if they would make it home. If the Queen would comply with their plan.</p><p>Jon\u2019s hands squeezed Y/N tighter to his chest. Her own hands raising to place over his, stroking her thumb across the rough, calloused skin. Bending his head down, Jon placed a kiss on her neck. Keeping his head in the crook of her neck as he breathed deeply in and out. He had taken accustom to doing so when he wanted to be reminded that she was here. Truly here with him. For he had imagined her touch so many times, that it took more than her hold to bring to reality that she was her; at his side.</p><p>\u201cI will do anything I can for us to make it home. To make it back to Winterfell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhether its Winterfell, Castle Black, or even further North of this world, as long as you, Greywind and Tormund are by my side, I know I will be okay.\u201d</p><p>The pair stared out into the ocean; allowing the silence to encompass them. </p><p>A mere few days later, the trio arrived at Dragonstone. Docking the ship at the harbour, Jon and Davos walked down the ramp of the ship to meet their awaiting company. Y/N staying on the ships a few minutes longer; making sure that all was secure for the journey home. Stood at the end of the dock was not only Y/N\u2019s uncle Tyrion, but Missandei and Greyworm; ready to escort the guests to their queen.</p><p>\u201cThe bastard of Winterfell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe dwarf of Casterly Rock.\u201d</p><p>Tyrion and Jon both stared at each for a moment, quickly breaking into smiles. They stepped forward and shook hands.</p><p>\u201cI believe we last saw each other on top of the wall.\u201d</p><p>Jon chuckled, remembering the moment ever so clearly.</p><p>\u201cYou were pissing off the edge, if I remember right. You picked up some scars along the road.\u201d</p><p>Tyrion nodded his head in agreement.</p><p>\u201cIt&rsquo;s been a long road. But we&rsquo;re both still here.\u201d</p><p>Turning to address Davos, Tyrion introduced himself to the gentleman.</p><p>\u201cI&rsquo;m Tyrion Lannister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDavos Seaworth.\u201d</p><p>The pair shook hands in acknowledgement.</p><p>\u201cAh, the Onion Knight. We fought on opposite sides at the Battle of Blackwater Bay.\u201d</p><p>Davos chortled.</p><p>\u201cUnluckily for me.\u201d</p><p>Moving a step backwards, Tyrion introduced Missandei to the two guests. The woman bowing her head in respect to the two men.</p><p>\u201cWelcome to Dragonstone. Our queen knows this is a long journey. She appreciates the effort you have made on her behalf. If you wouldn&rsquo;t mind handing over your weapons.\u201d</p><p>Jon looked at Davos and his men.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not giving over my weapons. No fucking way. Not whilst we are on foreign land.\u201d</p><p>The men and woman all turned to the sound of the new voice.</p><p>Y/N walked her way down the plank and to her accompanying men. Head held high, she situated herself to the right of Jon. Making it clear she was not letting go of her bow and arrow, or her sword. Her hand holding it tightly as it laid sheathed at her side.</p><p>Tyrion did not recognise his niece as she travelled closer to group. The face only becoming familiar once she ceased her steps, standing alongside the bastard of Winterfell. The last he had seen of her was before she and her family departed for Winterfell. Her dark brown hair long and luxurious like her mothers. She had been draped in the colours of both House Lannister and Baratheon. Now, as she stood before him, her hair laid half up and half down; slightly shorter than it had been before. Her body draped under fur upon fur; mixtures of browns, greys, and tans. She stood taller, stronger, more prepared for danger. Nothing like the innocent Baratheon he had last seen. Her face scarred from not only the Red Wedding but from the dangers she had faced whilst playing the Game of Thrones.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re alive?\u201d</p><p>Y/N could not help but chuckle at her uncle\u2019s shock. She knew her family thought of her as dead. Her where about had not been recorded since the destruction of the Red Wedding. Not until now anyways.</p><p>\u201cAs are you uncle Tyrion. Seems we both took a hit to the face.\u201d</p><p>The man touched his scarred cheek, staring directly at the one that laid across the right side of Y/N\u2019s face. Slightly pink due to the rough wind and cold breeze.</p><p>\u201cWhilst you were scarred in battle, I was scarred in a massacre. At the order of my own grandfather.\u201d</p><p>Tyrion looked guiltily to the ground. Keeping his gaze fixed to the floor, he replied to his dearest niece.</p><p>\u201cI took care of him.\u201d</p><p>Y/N refused to drop her anger fuelled expression. She may have loved her uncle Tyrion, but to see a member of her family for the first time in so long, brought forward the repressed hatred she held towards her mother, grandfather, and other Lannister\u2019s involved.</p><p>\u201cI know. He deserved what he got. He should never have treated you the way that he did.\u201d</p><p>Tyrion raised his head in surprise. Staring at the woman before him.</p><p>\u201cHe should have never called the order of the Red Wedding.\u201d</p><p>As the group became silence over the woman\u2019s malice filled words, Jon placed his hand on top of her own. Squeezing it ever so slightly; motioning that he was there for her. She squeezed back.</p><p>Missandei stepped forward, standing slightly behind Tyrion. </p><p>\u201cThe Khaleesi wishes to speak to you all at once of your arrival. But first, your weapons please.\u201d</p><p>Y/N went to argue once more, only choosing not due to the look she gained from both Jon and her uncle. She felt like a teenager again. Huffing she pulled her bow and arrows from her back and unclipped her sword from her waist. Handing them over to the leader of the Unsullied.</p><p>\u201cYou better not damage them. Wildlings don\u2019t have luxuries, like a Queen, to buy new weapons when one is broken.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWildlings? I thought you were a princess?\u201d</p><p>Y/N smiled at Missandei\u2019s confusion.</p><p>\u201cI was a princess. Not anymore.\u201d</p><p>Missandei continued forward.</p><p>Davos, Y/N and Jon followed the woman on the path to where the Queen awaited. Tyrion and Greyworm trailing at the rear. </p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-Jon, Y/N and Davos approached the throne room as Dothraki guards opened the doors to allow them entrance. Coming to a halt, the group cannot help but stare at the sight of the Khaleesi, sitting highly on the intricate throne. </p><p>\u201cYou stand in the presence of Daenerys Stormborn of House Targaryen, rightful heir to the Iron Throne, rightful Queen of the Andals and the First Men, Protector of the Seven Kingdoms, the Mother of Dragons, the Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea, The Unburnt, The Breaker of Chains.\u201d</p><p>At Missandei\u2019s words, Jon turned and looked at Davos.</p><p>\u201cThis is Jon Snow. He&rsquo;s King in the North.\u201d</p><p>Tyrion could not help but smirk. Neither could his niece.</p><p>\u201cThank you for traveling so far, My Lords. I hope the seas weren&rsquo;t too rough. And who may this be accompanying you both? I was only made aware of the presence of male guests.\u201d</p><p>Y/N resisted rolling her eyes at the Targaryen woman.</p><p>Before Davos could introduce her, Tyrion cleared his throat.</p><p>\u201cThis is Princess Y/N of House Baratheon, my Queen. Oldest and only pure blood child of the former King Robert Baratheon of the Seven Kingdoms.\u201d</p><p>Y/N could not hold her tongue.</p><p>\u201cI was Princess of House Baratheon and Lannister, your Grace. But I am no longer.\u201d</p><p>Daenerys was not sure how she felt about the woman before her. Deemed a princess but refused the title.</p><p>\u201cWhy so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor the Houses in which my lineage belonged have hands soaked in blood. Mostly for the wrong reasons. I choose not to be associated with such terrors.\u201d</p><p>Daenerys took in the woman\u2019s words. </p><p>She continued to speak of the former support of House Stark to the Targaryen seat of the throne. Apologising for the actions of her father and more. Offering Jon Snow the position of Warden of the North if he swore to bend the knee.</p><p>Whilst the Khaleesi spoke to the trio, images flashed in Y/N\u2019s mind. Segments of the dreams she had whilst Melisandre resurrected her those few months ago. \u00a0The voice. The language. The destruction. It was her. The Khaleesi.</p><p>\u201cYou&rsquo;re right. You&rsquo;re not guilty of your father&rsquo;s crime. And I&rsquo;m not beholden to my ancestor&rsquo;s vows.\u201d</p><p>Jon began to discuss with Daenerys about the dangers of the White Walkers and the threat the Night King held. Seeking help from the woman and her armies. </p><p>\u201cDid you see three dragons flying overhead when you arrived?</p><p>The torches of fire flew above them. Like in her dream. As the memories of her dreams began to take control of her attention, Y/N\u2019s eyes misted over. It was as though a mystic force was forcing her to view these images of what may be the future. Throughout the sounds of fire and screams, Y/N heard the faint sound of a bird. Calling in the distance. The sounds of a crown.</p><p>\u201cThe Army of the Dead is real. The White Walkers are real. The Knight King is real. I&rsquo;ve seen them. If they get past the wall and we&rsquo;re squabbling amongst ourselves \u2013&rdquo;</p><p>He began to walk closer to the throne.</p><p>\u201cWe&rsquo;re finished.\u201d</p><p>Turning away from the Khaleesi, he faced the Baratheon woman. Concerning taking over as he saw only the white of her eyes. Her Y/E/C completely gone. </p><p>Daenerys paused. Sensing the shift in atmosphere from the Northern man.</p><p>\u201cI was born at Dragonstone. Not that I can remember it.\u201d</p><p>Standing from the throne, Daenerys began to walk towards Jon, unaware of the cause of his concern.</p><p>\u201cWe fled before Robert&rsquo;s assassins could find us. Robert was your father&rsquo;s best friend, no? I wonder if your father knew his best friend sent assassins to murder a baby girl in her crib. Not that it matters now of course. I spent my life in foreign lands. So many men have tried to kill me. I don&rsquo;t remember all of their names. I have been sold like a brood mare. I have been chained and betrayed, raped and defiled. Do you know what kept me standing through all those years in exile? Faith. Not in any gods. Not in myths and legends. In myself. In Daenerys Targaryen. The world hadn&rsquo;t seen a dragon in centuries until my children were born. The Dothraki hadn&rsquo;t crossed the sea. Any sea.\u201d</p><p>She ceased her steps as she neared the man in question. </p><p>\u201cThey did for me. I was born to rule the Seven Kingdoms. And I will.\u201d</p><p>Jon swivelled to face the woman. </p><p>Daenerys face fell as the colour drained from Jon\u2019s. Following his gaze as everyone moved to stare at frozen stance of Y/N. Her face contorted in fear and anguish.</p><p>Y/N lip began to quiver as the sound of screams and fire became too much to handle. When all of the sudden, her breaths stopped. Her lips quivered no more. While Y/N eyes were still misty, her gaze was now transfixed on the Khaleesi. Her eyebrows furrowed, and terror was still apparent across her features. </p><p>Jon moved to stand closer to the woman, worried that she could collapse at any moment. </p><p>\u201cY/N?\u201d</p><p>Her gaze did not waver. With her eyes on the Khaleesi, and the sound of screams and fire dissipating in her mind, Y/N uttered a warning. High Valyrian leaving her tongue as though it was her mother language. The words sending a shiver of fear down the Khaleesi\u2019s spine.</p><p>\u201cAsh kessa ropagon toliot se s\u012bkuda D\u0101r\u0233ti. \u00a0Syt lo se suvion won&rsquo;t oss\u0113nagon \u012blva, perzys kessa.\u201d<br/>(Ash will fall over the seven kingdoms. For if the ice won&rsquo;t kill us, fire will.)</p><p>Once the words left her mouth, Y/N breathed once more. The mist in her eyes slowly evaporated; coming back to her sense. </p><p>Shaking her head, Y/N looked around at the people in the room. Confused at why the Khaleesi and everyone else looked towards her in either worry or shock.</p><p>Locking her gaze on Jon, she grabbed his hand.</p><p>\u201cAre we done? Is it time to rest now because I have a large headache.\u201d</p><p>No one uttered any argument. Even the Khaleesi did not object, nodding to Tyrion as a sign that the conversations was over. For now.</p><p>\u201cMissandei, may you please show our guests to their chambers. We will continue talks on the matter shortly.\u201d</p><p>Tightening his hold on Y/N\u2019s hand, Jon could not tear his eyes away from his woman as they were escorted to their temporary chambers.</p><p>\u201cY/N?\u201d</p><p>Continuing to walk between Jon and Davos, Y/N turned her gaze to the Onion Knight.</p><p>\u201cYes, Davos?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you speak more than one language fluently?\u201d</p><p>Instantly the girl replied.</p><p>\u201cYes. I speak three.\u201d</p><p>The duo awaited her answer.</p><p>\u201cI speak our mother tongue, sarcasm, and Tormund.The man makes up his own words. You get used to them.\u201d</p><p>The two men looked towards one another. A silent conversation discussed between them. They would need to look into this matter further tomorrow. But as for then, they were all due a rest. For the weeks ahead in Dragonstone was to become some of the most active and challenging.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-During their stay in Dragonstone, Jon had convinced Daenerys to give her hand in support against the White Walkers. Gaining sufficient amounts of Dragon glass to help prepare the weaponry for the war. Since the meeting with Daenerys, Y/N\u2019s words were not discussed. However, the Dragon Queen kept a close eye on the Baratheon. Stunned at the woman\u2019s words and sudden eloquence of High Valyrian. For a woman who had denounced her title and lived amongst Wildlings, Daenerys could see she was powerful. And when Y/N interacted with the Queen\u2019s dragons for the first time, Daenerys could see how strong that power truly was.</p><p>Whilst Jon and Davos assisted with the mining of Dragon glass, Y/N had found much time on her hands. Becoming acquainted with her uncle once more, and even learning more about the ruling of the Khaleesi. She was clearly loved by many. Especially her dragons. </p><p>Y/N had not meant to wander as far as where the dragons were held. But she was bored. And with Jon out of the castle, there was not much she could do. Walking across the grounds she whistled to herself, shuffling her feet as she walked. All of a sudden, the harsh sounds of flapping wings could be heard. Y/N looked up to the sky, to see Drogon descend to the ground, Y/N quickly stepped back. Keeping a safe distance from the creature. He was the child of the Khaleesi, and Y/N felt that the Queen was still not particularly fond of her.</p><p>Once Drogon reached the ground, the dragon roared loudly into the sky. Y/N covered her ears at the screech; instantly beginning to panic. The Khaleesi probably was already on her way. Accusing her of harming her dragon. </p><p>\u201cNo. No. Please stop screeching. I am not going to hurt you. Look I am really small. I have no weapons. I\u2019ll even take off my furs if it makes you shut the fuck up.\u201d</p><p>In her panic ridden words, Y/N pulled of her cloak, and carefully placed it onto the ground. The dragon sensed the woman\u2019s panic; stopping his roars. Drogon\u2019s eyes pierced into Y/N. Watching her as she stood a mere few feet away from the creature; her arms held up in surrender.</p><p>Elsewhere in the castle, Jon had arrived at the throne room, discussing with Tyrion and Daenerys about the next step in the plan; capturing a white beyond the wall. The roar from Drogon had startled them all, causing the trio to rush to the location of the noise. Greywind, Missandei, and Davos all hot on their trails as they emerged from their own locations.</p><p>But when they arrived at the heart of the noise, no one could believe their eyes. For Y/N no longer stood far away from the dragon; fear and panic taking over her features. But she stood next to the dragon\u2019s enormous head, stroking the creature\u2019s snout in a soothing matter. Rhaegal and Viserion had arrived between the time it took for the group to arrive. Each at either side of Drogon. All staring at Y/N in the same content and soothed manner.</p><p>\u201cOne night, I hold on you<br/>Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, you<br/>Castamere, Castamere, Castamere, Castamere<br/>A coat of gold, a coat of red<br/>A lion still has claws<br/>And mine are long and sharp, my Lord<br/>As long and sharp as yours.\u201d</p><p>Daenerys slowly stepped forward. Y/N still blissfully unaware of the group.</p><p>\u201cWhat is she singing?\u201d</p><p>Tyrion came to stand by his Queen.</p><p>\u201cIt is the song of House Lannister, my Queen.\u201d</p><p>Y/N never let her eyes drift from the dragon\u2019s. Resting her own head on its snout as her hand travelled to stroke the dragon\u2019s neck. She felt a connection with the creature. </p><p>\u201cAnd so, I speak, and so I speak<br/>A girl of House of the Dear.<br/>And now I weep, and now I weep<br/>For the friends who are no longer here.\u201d</p><p>Tyrion exhaled a deep breath.</p><p>\u201cThat my Queen\u2026 is not part of the song of House Lannister or Baratheon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Everyone\u2019s gaze locked on Y/N. Surprised that she had finally acknowledged their presence.</p><p>\u201cIt is part of me.\u201d</p><p>Jon held his breath at her words. Watching in sorrow as a tear not only fell from Y/N\u2019s eyes, but the three dragons as well. </p><p>Daenerys raged within. She was powerful indeed. If she had been able to connect with her children, moving them to tears, Daenerys would have to do all she can to keep the woman on her side. For even though Y/N did not wish for the seven kingdoms, Daenerys knew that she could still grasp it from the Targaryen\u2019s hands.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-<br/>When the night drew in, Y/N and Jon travelled to their chambers. Aware that their days ahead would be filled with difficult decisions and extreme conditions. </p><p>Even though the pair had shared chambers throughout their travels, they still ceased to have consummated their relationship. Both feared what the physical action could change between them. They knew of their love for one another. They had died for each other and would do so again. And yet neither had uttered those words. But in a world, such as their own, change was inevitable. </p><p>Once the duo had entered their chamber, Y/N discarded of her furs once more, pulling of her boots and untucking her shirt. Jon could see that she was still emotional. It seemed her emotions from her moment with the dragons had not dissipated. </p><p>Jon would usually leave Y/N to unchanged for bed, changing in one of the large bathrooms down the hall. However, he could not seem to have it in him to leave her alone at this moment. </p><p>Y/N began to get more frustrate with herself as she tried and failed to unbuckle her sword. Jon watched as she quickly gave up the task, holding her head in her hands in frustration. She had not felt this overwhelmed since the moment Jon arrived in the Wildling\u2019s camp. Seeing her uncle again, the segments of dreams, her moment with the dragons, and the tension she felt from Daenerys, all became too much. Tears fell from her eyes and into her hands. </p><p>Jon\u2019s heart broke at the sight of Y/N crying. He had only seen her cry few times of the years they spent together. Most of which had been the last few years. He missed when times were easier, brighter, happier. When all he thought about was marrying her. He still thought about it. But this game had clouded his brain; stealing time that he could have had with her. He did not want any more time to be lost.</p><p>Walking across the room, Jon lowered to his knee in front of Y/N. Pulling her hands away from her face, Jon wiped away the tears that rolled down her cheeks. Slowly placing his lips onto her own, gently caressing his mouth across hers. He wanted her to know he was there. That he had always been there. Y/N reciprocated the gesture. Allowing her arms to travel to the man\u2019s hair, pulling his raven locks free from its confines. Enveloping her hands through the tresses. Jon could not help but moan at the feeling. Pulling back, he muttered the words that had always been there. But had never been said.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Y/N Baratheon. I loved you from the moment you arrived with your father for your annual visit when I was 12 years old. I loved you then and I love you now.\u201d</p><p>Jon waited for a reply. The room filled with silence. Y/N\u2019s hands still in his hair as she stared at the man in disbelief. Jon began to regret his decision when suddenly, Y/N began to giggle. The giggle soon turned into a boisterous laugh as a large smile overtook her face.</p><p>Jon looked on in hurt and confusion.</p><p>Seeing his confused state, Y/N pulled Jon\u2019s face down to her own, placing a chaste kiss onto his mouth. </p><p>\u201cI love you too, Jon Snow. There was a reason I did not want to marry Robb. I had another Stark in mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d</p><p>Y/N giggled, her right hand moving to hold Jon\u2019s neck. </p><p>\u201cNo, Sansa. Yes, you. It has always been you Jon.\u201d</p><p>To say he was elated would be an understatement. That moment, Jon knew however this game ended, if Y/N was by his side, he could withstand the most ruthless leaders and most horrendous torture, as long as she was alive.</p><p>With the confessions of their love, the moment elevated their relationship emotionally and physically. For that night Y/N and Jon became each other\u2019s half. Consummating their relationship\u2026 more than once. Deep down, they had always known that they held love for each other, but they both had to grow as people; as their own individuals. </p><p>The cherished moment seemed to have sparked a light in the pair. For after that night, they refused to leave each other\u2019s side. Words of love and encouragement shared in intimate moments. They still caused trouble for each other as much as they did when they were younger, but now all Y/N and Jon could feel was each other\u2019s love. And they would both do anything to keep the other safe.</p><p>The duo and Davos soon saw their group expand. Heading to Eastwatch-by-the-Sea to capture a White Walker, they had gathered Tormund, Jorah Mormont, Gendry, Sandor Clegane, Thoros, Beric Dondarrion, and a few others along the way. With the loss of Thoros, a few other men, as well as Viserion at the hand of the Night King. Jon and his group had travelled to Kings Landing, to ask for the assistance of Queen Cersei against the White Walkers. Y/N had refused to attend. Her mother and uncle Jaime still blissfully unaware of her livelihood. She could not face her mother, after everything she had done. Not yet.</p><p>Winterfell was their next adventure. Travelling by boat with the Khaleesi and her hands, Jon wrapped his arms around Y/N\u2019s waist. The same as he did all those months ago when they had voyaged to Dragonstone. She turned in his hold, running her hands over the man\u2019s shoulders. </p><p>\u201cAre you ready? Ready to be back in Winterfell. With your family. With me.\u201d she questioned her partner.</p><p>Jon looked down at the woman in his arms.</p><p>\u201cI have never been so ready for anything else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither have I.\u201d</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-Laying in the chambers that had once been his brothers, Jon turned to his side to see Y/N still fast asleep. Tired from the journey they had taken to Winterfell with the Khaleesi and her army. She had been feeling more tired in the past few weeks, blaming it on the numerous exertions beyond the wall, having to deal with Jon and Tormund every day, and her body still getting used to being alive once more.</p><p>Jon admired his beloved, wrapping his arm around the woman, pulling her to lay as near to him as possible. He watched as Greywind slowly move closer to the bed, placing his head on top of Y/N\u2019s stomach. Jon dismissed the action, not thinking anything of the creature\u2019s behaviour.</p><p>A smile overtook the man\u2019s face. Leaning down, he placed a chaste kiss on Y/N\u2019s forehead, smiling even wider when her own face broke out into a sleep filled smile. Still unconscious, Y/N reached out her hand in Jon\u2019s direction. Jon instantly tangling it with his own. Laying his head down to rest, Jon shut his eyes. They would both need sleep to prepare themselves for the inevitable war.</p><p>However, what both of the wild spirits failed to realise that they no longer had to keep each other safe, but also the life that was growing as they slept. Greywind nuzzled Y/N\u2019s stomach, hearing a small heart beat loud and clear.</p><p>For Jon may have thought to have been a bastard and Y/N a princess of House Baratheon and Lannister, but their child would be so much more. A child of the Houses Targaryen, Lannister, Baratheon, and Stark. A child of the Wildlings and rightful heir to the Iron Throne. A child of the North, South, East and West. A child that would create a new world. </p><p><br/></p><p><b>A/N- Woah, three weeks of non-stop writing as well as exams. My next piece is either going to be Podrick or Sandor Clegane.

Yes that is correct.</i></b></p>\n<p><b><i>Warnings- death, angst, murder, spoilers (bit late now), fluff, and everything in between.</i></b></p>\n<hr>\n<p>&ldquo;I bet you can&rsquo;t shoot an arrow through the middle of the target.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I bet I can.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Y/N Baratheon was not a girl to be challenged. Especially by Jon Snow. Her closest and dearest friend from the North. </p>\n<p>Ever since her father, King Robert Baratheon, and Ned Stark had formed an allegiance, Y/N had travelled with her father to Winterfell every month. Being the only true born Baratheon of her siblings, Y/N and her father was very close. Whilst Robert and Eddard Stark discussed important royal matters, Y/N and Jon were often causing trouble. From antagonising each other to cause mayhem, or choosing to do so on their own terms, the two together were a handful. With Robb added to the duo, the chaos greatly increased. For the trio showed no mercy with their mischief.</p>\n<p>Robb smirked at the younger duo. Leaning against the pillar, he watched on as Y/N furiously grabbed her bow and arrows. </p>\n<p>&ldquo;If you shoot the arrow through the target, you can have my portion of shank at dinner tonight.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Jon knew she would never back down the chance to have more food. Even though the Baratheon&rsquo;s was one of the strongest families in all the kingdoms, the House of Stark produced the most glorious food in the kingdoms. Food that tasted like it was made with love and from the heart. </p>\n<p>Squinting at the young bastard, Y/N nodded. </p>\n<p>&ldquo;Deal. And if I miss?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Jon looked at Robb, a smirk forming on both of their faces.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;You have to wear a dress at dinner tonight. And we mean, a dress preserved for weddings and balls; not any sort of old tat.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Y/N glared towards Robb as he spoke the conditions. Looking back at Jon, she waited to hear his opinion. </p>\n<p>The young man winked at the young woman, shrugging his shoulders as though he did not know what Robb was going to say. He did. They had agreed on her punishment earlier that morning.</p>\n<p>The young Baratheon loathed dresses. Refusing to wear them, unless for extravagant events; much to her mothers&rsquo; chagrin. She preferred to wear breeches and a tunic instead. They were more form fitting than that of a man&rsquo;s; for her mother only appeased with the clothing if it could be altered to uphold some femininity. </p>\n<p>The boys waited with baited breathes for her response.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Deal.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Cheers rang from the pair. Y/N shook Jon&rsquo;s hand. Watching as the young bastard walked towards Robb, and away from the direction of the target. And any areas around it. They were all still learning to shoot, so It was no surprise that an arrow wold stray every now and then.</p>\n<p>Taking a deep breath in, Y/N closed her eyes, slowing her breathing down. Opening her eyes, she raised her bow and arrow. Pulling the string back with necessary force, her vision zeroed in on the target. Moving her aim so that the arrow should fly straight through the centre. Taking one last inhale, she begins to release the string of the bow when-</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Y/N!&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The shout of her name caused Y/N to flinch, the arrow flying through the air. Embedding itself into the target. Just to the right of the bullseye. </p>\n<p>Y/N groaned, throwing the bow to the floor, she swivelled to the direction of the shout. Looking towards the balcony, Y/N stared at her father. </p>\n<p>&ldquo;Father look what you did. You just cost me an extra shank you knob.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Many would have been shocked to have heard how the princess spoke to the king, but it was normal. The two Baratheon&rsquo;s were not the conventional pair.</p>\n<p>King Robert chuckled heartily. With Eddard at his side, who raised an eyebrow in his son&rsquo;s direction. The two boys bowering the heads, to hide their laughter.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;All of you get ready for the banquet tonight. Robb come with me and your father. We have matters to discuss.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The three friends looked at each other in confusion. Robb shrugged his shoulders as he walked in the direction of your father and his. </p>\n<p>&ldquo;I wonder what they need him for.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Y/N walked towards Jon.

Turned out it sent my brain into hyper drive and this was the outcome. I did not expect it to be this long. But I have never felt so proud than I have writing this. SO, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mwv_vSZxPQeTauv5UpSpz7w\">@witch-of-letters</a> , I am sorry for the wait and I hope you all enjoy.</b></p><p><b><i>Word Count- 19,891 words. Yes that is correct.</i></b></p><p><b><i>Warnings- death, angst, murder, spoilers (bit late now), fluff, and everything in between.</i></b></p><hr><p>\u201cI bet you can\u2019t shoot an arrow through the middle of the target.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bet I can.\u201d</p><p>Y/N Baratheon was not a girl to be challenged. Especially by Jon Snow. Her closest and dearest friend from the North. </p><p>Ever since her father, King Robert Baratheon, and Ned Stark had formed an allegiance, Y/N had travelled with her father to Winterfell every month. Being the only true born Baratheon of her siblings, Y/N and her father was very close. Whilst Robert and Eddard Stark discussed important royal matters, Y/N and Jon were often causing trouble. From antagonising each other to cause mayhem, or choosing to do so on their own terms, the two together were a handful. With Robb added to the duo, the chaos greatly increased. For the trio showed no mercy with their mischief.</p><p>Robb smirked at the younger duo. Leaning against the pillar, he watched on as Y/N furiously grabbed her bow and arrows. </p><p>\u201cIf you shoot the arrow through the target, you can have my portion of shank at dinner tonight.\u201d</p><p>Jon knew she would never back down the chance to have more food. Even though the Baratheon\u2019s was one of the strongest families in all the kingdoms, the House of Stark produced the most glorious food in the kingdoms. Food that tasted like it was made with love and from the heart. </p><p>Squinting at the young bastard, Y/N nodded. </p><p>\u201cDeal. And if I miss?\u201d</p><p>Jon looked at Robb, a smirk forming on both of their faces.</p><p>\u201cYou have to wear a dress at dinner tonight. And we mean, a dress preserved for weddings and balls; not any sort of old tat.\u201d</p><p>Y/N glared towards Robb as he spoke the conditions. Looking back at Jon, she waited to hear his opinion. </p><p>The young man winked at the young woman, shrugging his shoulders as though he did not know what Robb was going to say. He did. They had agreed on her punishment earlier that morning.</p><p>The young Baratheon loathed dresses. Refusing to wear them, unless for extravagant events; much to her mothers\u2019 chagrin. She preferred to wear breeches and a tunic instead. They were more form fitting than that of a man\u2019s; for her mother only appeased with the clothing if it could be altered to uphold some femininity. </p><p>The boys waited with baited breathes for her response.</p><p>\u201cDeal.\u201d</p><p>Cheers rang from the pair. Y/N shook Jon\u2019s hand. Watching as the young bastard walked towards Robb, and away from the direction of the target. And any areas around it. They were all still learning to shoot, so It was no surprise that an arrow wold stray every now and then.</p><p>Taking a deep breath in, Y/N closed her eyes, slowing her breathing down. Opening her eyes, she raised her bow and arrow. Pulling the string back with necessary force, her vision zeroed in on the target. Moving her aim so that the arrow should fly straight through the centre. Taking one last inhale, she begins to release the string of the bow when-</p><p>\u201cY/N!\u201d</p><p>The shout of her name caused Y/N to flinch, the arrow flying through the air. Embedding itself into the target. Just to the right of the bullseye. </p><p>Y/N groaned, throwing the bow to the floor, she swivelled to the direction of the shout. Looking towards the balcony, Y/N stared at her father. </p><p>\u201cFather look what you did. You just cost me an extra shank you knob.\u201d</p><p>Many would have been shocked to have heard how the princess spoke to the king, but it was normal. The two Baratheon\u2019s were not the conventional pair.</p><p>King Robert chuckled heartily. With Eddard at his side, who raised an eyebrow in his son\u2019s direction. The two boys bowering the heads, to hide their laughter.</p><p>\u201cAll of you get ready for the banquet tonight. Robb come with me and your father. We have matters to discuss.\u201d</p><p>The three friends looked at each other in confusion. Robb shrugged his shoulders as he walked in the direction of your father and his. </p><p>\u201cI wonder what they need him for.\u201d</p><p>Y/N walked towards Jon. The pair watching as Robb and their fathers head into the castle.</p><p>\u201cWell, you better start getting ready. Who knows how long it\u2019ll take to get into your dress.\u201d</p><p>Jon laughed as Y/N turned towards him, stepping so close that their breathes mingled. Leaning impossible closer to his face, Y/N glared into Jon\u2019s eyes. </p><p>\u201cI may have missed the bullseye, but if that was a real man, it would have gone straight through his heart.\u201d</p><p>At the end of her words, Y/N moved back from their proximity and walked in the direction of her chambers. Jon staring at how her hips swayed as she aggressively walked further away. </p><p>Flittering his gaze between his chest and the target, he realised she was right. Shaking his head, Jon began his trek towards his own chambers. The only thought flittering through his mind was how he was one day going to marry Y/N Baratheon; bastard or not. He was going to make it a reality.</p>[[MORE]]<p><br></p><p>The banquet had begun 20 minutes before Y/N had arrived. Robb sitting next to his siblings and parents at the head of the hall. Even Theon was sat amongst the Starks. For once, Catelyn had allowed Jon to attend; to appease Y/N\u2019s begs of her friend being present. \u00a0Sitting away from all Baratheon\u2019s and Starks, Jon conversed with his uncle Benjen, speaking of matters that could affect his future greatly.</p><p>Jon had been awaiting Y/N\u2019s arrival. When she had walked through the door, he could not help but catch his breath. Neither could Robb, or any young man in close proximity. Whilst Jon could not tear his eyes away from Y/N, his uncle Benjen left Jon to ogle.</p><p>\u201cBloody hell. She should be bent over and ravished in that dress.\u201d</p><p>Robb elbowed Theon in his stomach. Causing the ward to lose his breath; coughing on the lack of it.</p><p>Y/N looked at the table at the head of the room. Seeing her plate next to her fathers and her mothers. Walking towards it, she reached where it laid. </p><p>At the sight of their daughter, her parents ceased their conversation. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re finally looking like a lady Y/N. What has caused this drastic change? Or should I ask whom?\u201d</p><p>Y/N rolled her eyes at her mother\u2019s words.</p><p>Going to grab her plate, she hiked up her skirt to climb up the platform to the table. </p><p>Piling more vegetables and mashed potatoes on her sparsely filled plate (most likely her mother\u2019s doing) she shoved her shank into her mouth, ripping off a large portion of the meat. With her plate in one hand, and her shank in the other, Y/N pointed at her father with the bone of meat. Amusement clear on his face. Whilst her mother and siblings held disgust. Laughter could be heard from the Stark children at her antics.</p><p>\u201cStupid bets with the stupid Stark boys. I would have had it if father had not called for me.\u201d</p><p>Robert bellowed with laughter at his daughter\u2019s frustration. </p><p>She turned to glare at him, however, she could not keep a smile from taking over.</p><p>\u201cBecause of that, I am going to sit with Jon. The poor bastard is probably bored out of his mind.\u201d</p><p>Cersei shook her head at her daughter\u2019s words.</p><p>\u201cYou will do no such thing.\u201d</p><p>Y/N bore her eyes into her mother\u2019s, taking another bite out of her shank.</p><p>Chewing the meat ever so slowly, she swallowed the chunk. Throwing the bone on her plate, she licked her fingers clean; angering her mother even more. </p><p>\u201cLet her mother, she\u2019s acting like a homeless harlot any way.\u201d</p><p>Whipping her head towards Joffrey, she took in his words. Looking her younger brother up and down with a glare that could kill, the young Lannister swallowed harshly.</p><p>Heading to walk past the Starks and down the steps of the platform, she kept her eyes on Joffrey, stopping to stand in front of the young Stark girls.</p><p>\u201cSansa cover your ears.\u201d</p><p>The girl did so.</p><p>Directing her words back to Joffrey, she smirked at her brother.</p><p>\u201cYou can call me a harlot. But at least I\u2019m not an incestuous little bitch.\u201d</p><p>Cersei\u2019s head whipped in her daughter\u2019s direction. Watching as she diverted her attention to the Starks.</p><p>Y/N smiled as Arya, Theon, and Robb chuckled at her words. Motioning for Sansa to uncover her ears, she knew the girl still heard. But she didn\u2019t care. </p><p>\u201cNow if you\u2019ll excuse me. I have fulfilled my duties and my part of the bet. So, I am going to sit with Jon and enjoy my meal.\u201d</p><p>As she continued her path across the platform, Y/N reached out her hand to quickly grab Theon\u2019s leftover shank.</p><p>The ward standing in his seat.</p><p>\u201cYou fucking bitch! I didn\u2019t finish that.\u201d</p><p>The girl trotted down the steps, walking through the array of people backwards. </p><p>Much like she had done to her father, Y/N used the shank to point at Theon.</p><p>\u201cNext time you talk about bending over a girl and ravishing her without consent, think about how you will go hungry for the rest of the night.\u201d</p><p>Turning to face Jon, she walked towards the man; who had witnessed and heard mostly everything. </p><p>Robb sitting next to Theon, laughed as the ward fell back into his seat in a sulk. </p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s right mate.\u201d</p><p>Theon scoffed.</p><p>\u201cAt least I won\u2019t be married to her and have her not love me back.\u201d</p><p>Robb stared at the Greyjoy.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean? She might learn to love me back.\u201d</p><p>Theon scoffed, continuing to eat the food left on his plate.</p><p>\u201cYou really think her, and Jon only see each other as friends. Why do you think her father and yours are marrying her to you? Jon\u2019s a bastard and not a Stark. If he were, they would be married by morning.\u201d</p><p>Robb shifted in his seat. He knew Y/N did not see him the same as he saw her. But for others to see the obvious tension between Jon and Y/N, and he hadn\u2019t, made it even more real for Robb. </p><p>Sitting back in his seat Robb looked forward.</p><p>\u201cRemember, you aren\u2019t a Stark either Greyjoy. So, stop pretending that you are.\u201d</p><p>Theon paused his eating at Robb\u2019s words. Rage bubbling deep inside as he began to drink his wine excessively. </p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-</p><p>Dropping her plate in front of Jon, Y/N raised her skirt to sit comfortably on the chair. Shovelling Theon\u2019s shank, unattractively, into her mouth. Using her sleeve as a makeshift napkin to wipe her face.</p><p>Jon could not help but watch in amusement. </p><p>Swallowing the food, Y/N looked into her friend\u2019s eyes. </p><p>\u201cHas Ned told you?\u201d</p><p>Taking a swig of his wine, he placed the cup down.</p><p>\u201cTold me what?\u201d</p><p>Wiping her mouth once more, Y/N reached over to grasp Jon\u2019s drink, gulping some down herself.</p><p>\u201cMy father and Ned have arranged for Robb and I to wed.\u201d</p><p>In disbelief, all Jon could do was stare at Y/N.</p><p>Putting his cup back on the table, Y/N leaned her head on her hand, watching herself play with her food.</p><p>\u201cThey haven\u2019t told me yet. Turns out Arya over heard them tell Robb. She came to me straight away. Telling me that Robb did not argue against it, the cunt.\u201d</p><p>Jon licked his lips. Running his hands over his face. Looking back at the young woman in front of him, Jon analysed her expression.</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re not happy with this?\u201d</p><p>Y/N rolled her eyes at his question. </p><p>Waving her hand in the air, she answered.</p><p>\u201cOf course, I am not happy Jon. Robb is like a brother to me. I don\u2019t view him in that way. And unlike some people in these kingdoms, I don\u2019t want to fuck my family. I want to marry whomever I choose.\u201d</p><p>Jon laughed at her words.</p><p>\u201cAnyway, what did Benjen want? You seemed to be having a pretty serious conversation.\u201d</p><p>It was Jon\u2019s turn to stare at his own plate.</p><p>\u201cHe came to inform me that he was travelling to join the Nightswatch. And I told him that I want to join too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>Jon raised his gaze to the girl, seeing her expression fall.</p><p>\u201cSo, Lord Stark, Sansa, and Arya will be travelling to Kingslanding back with your family. I will follow Benjen to the wall-\u201c</p><p>\u201cAnd I will be here, marrying Robb, and helping your mother tend to Bran, whilst Theon does God knows what.\u201d</p><p>All Jon did was nod his head. </p><p>\u201cWell we better make the most of today and tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Raising her shank, she laughed as Jon cheered it with his own. The pair continuing to laugh throughout the feast. </p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-As there last day together approached, Y/N and Jon never left each other\u2019s side. Causing more mischief than ever before. King Robert and Eddard chose not to interfere, knowing that it was going to be a while before they would see each other again. Robb had also left the pair alone, for Y/N would be his wife soon, and they would be together for a long time coming. </p><p>The day went too quickly for the pair, and as morning came, Y/N could not help but feel the tears gather in her eyes at the thought of being left by her father and Jon. </p><p>Watching as Arya and Sansa left with her family in tow. She stood next to the Stark sisters as the clambered onto their horses.</p><p>\u201cKeep Sansa safe Arya.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d The younger Stark replied.</p><p>\u201cAnd Sansa?\u201d</p><p>The older Stark looked towards Y/N.</p><p>The Baratheon smiled.</p><p>\u201cHelp yourself to all my dresses and fabric. I\u2019ve have never worn most of them.\u201d</p><p>Sansa smiled in appreciation.</p><p>Y/N\u2019s expression became more serious.</p><p>\u201cAnd please be careful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d</p><p>The pair went to begin their journey to Kingslanding. </p><p>Y/N turned to the guard next to her; already mounted on his steed.</p><p>\u201cPlease watch over them Sandor. You and I both know how evil of a cunt Joffrey is.\u201d</p><p>The Hound huffed at her words. Lifting the helmet, he placed it on his head.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do my best. Don\u2019t get yourself killed now little Doe.\u201d</p><p>Y/N laughed at his nickname for her, watching as her family and the Starks set of on their journey. </p><p>She had already said goodbye to her father in privacy. Not wanting to cry even more than she knew she would when she would have to say goodbye to Jon.</p><p>Once the carriage and horses were a mere speck in the horizon, she allowed herself to face Jon. Examining the exchange between him and Robb, she could feel her heart hurt at the sight. </p><p>Strolling towards them, Y/N witnessed as the Stark brother\u2019s let each other go. Quickly taking Robb\u2019s position as he left the pair to say their goodbye\u2019s.</p><p>Standing next to his steed, Jon watched as Y/N walked slowly towards him. Quickly gulping down the sobs in her throat, Y/N pulled Jon in too a tight embrace. Burying her head in the crook of his neck, the young pair stayed in that position for a long time, that \u2018just friends\u2019 would deem too long.</p><p>Jon was the first to pull away. Holding her face in his hands, Jon stroked her cheek with his thumb. Catching the tears that had escaped her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI promise that we will see each other soon. You can tell me all about the married life with my brother.\u201d</p><p>Y/N laughed. Clutching Jon\u2019s furs with her fists. She pulled him closer, their heads resting against the others. A solemn look falling on her face.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to marry Robb.\u201d</p><p>Jon let out a breath.</p><p>\u201cI know. I wish you wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>She replied.</p><p>\u201cSo, do I. I love him, but not in the way a man and wife love another.\u201d</p><p>Pulling her head back, Y/N\u2019s hand travelled to Jon\u2019s neck. Her surprisingly warm fingers sending tingles down the man\u2019s spine.</p><p>\u201cPromise we will see each other again.\u201d</p><p>Jon nodded his head. </p><p>\u201cI promise.\u201d</p><p>As he muttered his promise, Y/N leaned her face closer to his own. Placing her lips on his cheek, she slowly pulled them away. Detaching herself from the Stark bastard, Y/N sadly smiled at Jon.</p><p>\u201cYou better get going. By the time you get there, the snow would have melted.\u201d</p><p>Jon chuckled. Mounting his horse, he positioned himself comfortable on the saddle. </p><p>Benjen began to follow the Nightswatch as they started their journey out of the gates of Winterfell.</p><p>Y/N stepped back as Jon trotted his horse to catch up with his uncle. </p><p>\u201cJon!\u201d</p><p>Turning his head, he caught Y/N\u2019s gaze.</p><p>\u201cRemember. If you ever need to, aim to the right.\u201d</p><p>Jon felt a large smile take over his face.</p><p>\u201cStraight at the heart.\u201d</p><p>Y/N smiled in return.</p><p>\u201cStraight at the heart.\u201d</p><p>Much like her father leaving, Y/N stood in her place. Refusing to move until Jon was a speck in the distance.</p><p>As she stood, watching Jon leave, Robb slowly approached. Standing to the side of the Baratheon princess. </p><p>The pair stood in silence. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Robb looked towards his soon to be wife.</p><p>\u201cWhat for?\u201d</p><p>She let a few tears fall.</p><p>\u201cI love him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you too.\u201d</p><p>Robb turned his gaze back to the gates. The two watching as the guards shut them closed.</p><p>\u201cBut not in the same way.\u201d</p><p>Y/N shook her head.</p><p>Placing a hand on Robb\u2019s shoulder, their eyes connected.</p><p>\u201cNo. But I will be the best wife I can be.\u201d</p><p>Robb smiled at her words. He had no doubt she wouldn\u2019t.</p><p>Squeezing his shoulder, Y/N let her hand drop, walking away from Robb and away from the gates where she had said goodbye to her family and Jon. Walking into the castle that she now would call home. But nowhere would be home without her father. And nowhere would make her feel as happy as when she was with Jon.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-As the months passed, it became easier for Y/N to become more comfortable in her permanent residence at Winterfell. Coming to terms of her life with Robb. He was her friend, and he needed her help. Robb accepted the fact that she did not love him the same, but he knew she still cared for him deeply. And when word had come to Winterfell that King Robert Baratheon had sadly passed, Robb\u2019s shoulder was there for Y/N to cry on. Y/N had reciprocated the compassion when news of Ned\u2019s execution hit Winterfell. She hated Joffrey and her mother with a passion.</p><p>The young Baratheon was distraught. Being the closest to her father out of her siblings, she felt as though she had lost the only true family member she had. Heartbroken that she was not at his side when he sadly passed. Her tears of sorrow were soon replaced with tears of dread when she realised what would occur if anyone was to find out the true bloodline of her siblings. She had known for years of Cersei and Jaime\u2019s relationship. How nobody else had realised why she looked so contrasting to her siblings, Y/N prayed for the day that the truth would be revealed to never come.</p><p>However, it did, and as Joffrey sat on the Iron Throne, word had travelled around the kingdoms. Causing the War of the Five Kings to begin. With Joffrey, her uncle Stannis and Renly, Balon Greyjoy, and Robb, all fighting for the throne.</p><p>As the war surged forward, Y/N noticed that Robb\u2019s attention had been caught by one of the young healers; Talisa. Watching the pair converse, Y/N smiled to herself. She was happy that he had finally found true love. And at that moment of thought, Jon entered her mind. She wondered where he was now. If he ever thought of her on his travels. If he was safe, or even still alive. </p><p>On a seemingly quiet night, Catelyn approached Y/N in the drawing room. As she pulled the girl into her embrace, she informed her of the nuptials that would occur that evening.<br>\u201cFor Robb and I?\u201d</p><p>Catelyn shook her head, a smile taking over her features.</p><p>\u201cNo. For Talisa and Robb.\u201d</p><p>Y/N let out the breath she held. Robb was her \u201cbrother\u201d, and he was finally going to get married. To someone who loved him back.</p><p>\u201cThank high heavens. No disrespect Catelyn. I love your son. But not in that way.\u201d</p><p>The Stark woman laughed at the Baratheon\u2019s exclamation; enveloping her in another hug.</p><p>\u201cI know you mean no harm in your words. It\u2019s not your fault that your heart belongs to Ned\u2019s bastard.\u201d</p><p>Y/N shook her head, pulling herself out of the woman\u2019s grasp.</p><p>\u201cGive the boy some slack Catelyn. He\u2019s out there defending the wall for us.\u201d</p><p>Catelyn dismissed the girl\u2019s words with a wave of her hand.</p><p>\u201cNow let\u2019s get you in something more suitable for a wedding. No more breeches for the rest of the day.\u201d</p><p>Y/N followed begrudgingly as Catelyn helped her get ready for Robb\u2019s wedding. </p><p>Walking across the field, Y/N sauntered into Robb\u2019s tent, watching as he finished getting ready.</p><p>\u201cWell somebody looks like a king.\u201d</p><p>Robb chuckled, turning to his friend. </p><p>\u201cAnd somebody looks like a princess.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI am one, you dickhead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t dress like one.\u201d</p><p>Y/N punched Robb\u2019s shoulder at his words.</p><p>Robb laughed.</p><p>\u201cCome one. Let\u2019s go get you married. This is going to be the best wedding in all the kingdoms.\u201d</p><p>For soon after the ceremony occurred, blood flooded the floors of the room. Waldor Frey\u2019s men killing everyone and anything. With Greywind at her side, and a bow in her hand, Y/N fought off many of the soldiers. Trying her best to protect Robb. </p><p>Out of nowhere, one of Frey\u2019s soldiers jumped from behind, swinging his dagger in Y/N\u2019s direction. Just as Y/N thought this would be her end, Greywind attacked the soldier\u2019s arm, causing the sword to slice Y/N\u2019s face; narrowly missing her eye. She was alive. She could deal with a cut face as long she was alive. Pulling her arrow back, she landed it perfectly into the heart of the solider; Greywind keeping him down with his grip on the man\u2019s arm.</p><p>\u201cY/N!\u201d</p><p>At the shout of her name, she turned to Robb. </p><p>\u201cGet out of here. Take Greywind with you.\u201d</p><p>Y/N shook her head.</p><p>\u201cI am not leaving you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you are. Go find Jon at the wall. I am not going to lose both Talisa and you. Mother and I will be okay. Go.\u201d</p><p>Y/N looked at Catelyn\u2019s direction.</p><p>\u201cGo.\u201d The women whispered.</p><p>AS Catelyn held the knife to the throat of Frey\u2019s wife, Y/N slipped out the room. Quickly mounting one of the horses, with Greywind at her side, and her bow on her back, she fled from the wedding and from Winterfell.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-She could feel in her bones the guilt of leaving Robb and his mother behind. Of not being able to help Talisa. Of not being able to do something more. The guilt and grief only grew more when on her way to the wall, as she stopped to eat in a small tavern, Y/N over-heard of the gruesome events that occurred after she left. Hearing men laugh as they spoke about how Waldor Frey\u2019s soldiers cut off Robb\u2019s head and paraded his body around. How Catelyn\u2019s throat was slit open. How Talisa was murdered, and so was her and Robb\u2019s unborn child.</p><p>She could not hear no more. Continuing to travel as she arrived closer and closer to the wall. Collecting weapons, furs, and food along her travels. Greywind never leaving her side. Y/N remembered the directions to the Nightswatch, having spoken to her father and Eddard about it in great deal; when she was younger. She was always fascinated by the stories of the wall, so it was no surprise that she would want to know more about the men who would be guarding it. </p><p>Y/N had been travelling for weeks when she finally arrived at the wall. Searching for a secluded space, she hopped off of her horse. Stroking the animal\u2019s mane, Y/N grabbed out the necessary food from her satchel. Feeding both the horse and Greywind before devouring an apple herself. She could not risk lighting a fire and cooking. It could draw unwanted attention. But what she didn\u2019t know was that she had already done so by being there. As she was finishing her apple, out of nowhere, Greywind began to snarl. Instantly dropping the core of her fruit, Y/N reached for her bow and arrows; standing in front of the horse with Geywind at her side. </p><p>Looking towards the area where Greywind gazed, she saw fur and lots of it, approaching where she stood at the wall. The figures moved closer and closer. Wildlings. Y/N had no time to run or hide. With the direwolf and horse by her side, she would not be able to escape quietly. Drawing her bow, Y/N made sure her weapons were secure on her body. She was not going to be killed by Wildlings. Not when she had survived this long.</p><p>As they approached, one by one, the Wildlings noticed the woman in front of them. She was dressed very similar to them. The only differences being that her furs were a mixture of red and black. Tormund stood near the front of the group with Ygritte by his side. So, it came as a very big surprise when they reached the wall to enter the watch, that a woman stood in front of it. With a bow in her hand and a huge fucking wolf snarling towards them. </p><p>Y/N pulled her bow to aim at the ginger Wildlings\u2019 chest.</p><p>\u201cTake another fucking step and I will shoot this arrow straight through your heart, Wildling.\u201d</p><p>Tormund let out a boisterous laugh at her words.</p><p>\u201cWill you kill me little fox? Will you kill us all? You don\u2019t know who you are messing with.\u201d</p><p>Without missing a beat, Y/N answered.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Tormund continued to laugh.</p><p>\u201cBut he will help me.\u201d</p><p>AT the sound of her words, Greywind began to growl louder, his body arching as he slowly strode closer to the Wildlings. </p><p>Tormund quickly became quiet. </p><p>\u201cNow if you don\u2019t let me go, I will paint this wall red with your blood and use your skulls as bowls to feed my direwolf. You hear?\u201d</p><p>Silence encompassed them. </p><p>\u201cI like her.\u201d</p><p>Y/N shifted her arrow to the ginger woman at her words.</p><p>Tormund\u2019s shocked expression moving to gaze at her as well. </p><p>Ygritte simply shrugged her shoulders. </p><p>\u201cShe has fire. You of all people should know how strong a person kissed by fire is.\u201d</p><p>The Wildling\u2019s murmured amongst each other, looking at Tormund to respond.</p><p>Tormund looked at Ygritte. The ginger girl giving a quick nod of her head. Their silent conversation coming to an agreement.</p><p>Turning back to the Baratheon, Tormund sheathed his dagger. Taking another step closer; to only take it back as the direwolf growled once more.</p><p>\u201cOkay little fox. We do no harm.\u201d</p><p>Y/N never let her eyes leave the group. Keeping herself on edge for any attack.</p><p>\u201cHere me out little fox.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo not call me fox. I am not a fox.\u201d</p><p>Tormund could see Ygritte smirk in the corner of his eye. Yes. She would fit right in. </p><p>\u201cIf you have no place to stay, come with us Wildlings. You will be safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need your help. I am safer alone.\u201d</p><p>Ygritte rolled her eyes at the girl\u2019s words. She felt that way once too.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t be safe when the Whites arrive.\u201d</p><p>Y/N shook her head. Not wanting to believe her words. She had heard stories, but it has been hundreds of years since White Walkers roamed around Westeroes. But her mind suddenly reeled back to all the warnings Eddard Stark had given before his death. Winter is Coming. That is what he meant.</p><p>Slowly lowering her bow, she kept the object in a type grip at her side. Clicking her tongue, she signalled for Greywind to heel at her feet. The direwolf still on high alert.</p><p>\u201cIf I was to come with you, you swear an oath to do me no harm.\u201d</p><p>Tormund laughed once more. As did many of the other Wildlings.</p><p>\u201cAn oath? Were Wildlings. You\u2019re lucky to even be offered shelter.\u201d</p><p>Y/N continued to stare at the man, her eyes flickering to Ygritte\u2019s, as the woman\u2019s expression remained serious.</p><p>\u201cWe swear.\u201d</p><p>At Ygritte\u2019s words, the Wildlings bellowed disagreements. </p><p>Y/N, taking Ygritte\u2019s word, began to lead her direwolf and horse towards the Wildlings. She trusted Ygritte. She even felt compelled to trust the big ginger one, but she still kept her eye out for any dirty bastard who would break their word.</p><p>\u201cFine. We will amuse this oath. But if you are to stay with us, you will live the Wildling way. They call me Tormund Giantsbane.\u201d</p><p>As they began to head towards the Wildling\u2019s keep, Y/N walked between Tormund and Ygritte. The rest of the Wildlings in front of them. Greywind stayed close behind Y/N for protection, as she led her horse by its reigns.</p><p>\u201cWhy Giantsbane?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI killed a giant when I was 10. Then I climbed right into bed with his wife. When she woke up, she suckled me at her teat for three months. Thought I was her baby. That\u2019s how I got so strong: giant\u2019s milk.\u201d</p><p>Y/N could not help but smile at the man\u2019s story. Confusing Tormund as many of whom he had told the story to would either look deathly afraid, repelled, or even turned on. Not amused like Y/N was.</p><p>\u201cNow what do they call you little fox.\u201d</p><p>Y/N thought whether or not to reveal her true identity. To be trusting or to be safe. She chose the latter.</p><p>\u201cThey call me Doe.\u201d</p><p>Tormund looked at the woman in confusion.</p><p>\u201cDoe? A deer?\u201d</p><p>Ygritte laughed at Tormund\u2019s expression.</p><p>\u201cA female deer.\u201d</p><p>Tormund glared at his Wildling friend.</p><p>\u201cI know what a doe is, you fucker.\u201d</p><p>Ygritte smirked.</p><p>\u201cIt sounded like you didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>As the two bickered back and forth, walking either side of the Baratheon, Y/N could not help but reminisce of the funny quarrels between her, Robb, and Jon. She missed them both dearly. Whilst she may never be able to reunite with Robb, she knew she was so close to seeing Jon. She could feel it.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-Turns out, Y/N\u2019s feelings were correct. For the bastard of Eddard Stark was a lot closer than she thought. She had been living with the Wildlings for nearly a year when Ygritte had travelled back from her duties at the wall. \u00a0But Ygritte wasn\u2019t alone. It seemed she had turned the tables on her capture; catching the crow herself. </p><p>As Ygritte travelled back to the Wildling den with the crow, Y/N and Tormund sat at the fire. The man watching as the woman hacked and carved the elks they and other Wildlings had caught earlier that day. She had come to take position of cook the minute she arrived. Being near the fire reminded her of life back home. She had also taken up cooking whilst living with Robb; wanting to become friendly with the servants and hand maidens that she thought would be with her for life. But how she was wrong. </p><p>During her months with the Wildlings, her skills in sword fighting had become a lot stronger. Adhering the techniques of the Wildlings, the Starks, and those her uncle Jaime had taught her, made Y/N\u2019s fighting style unique. Untouchable. Her skills with an arrow had no match to anyone else either. She was a strong warrior. One the Wildlings had come to admire.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve grown strong Little Doe. Nearly as strong as I.\u201d</p><p>Y/N smiled at Tormund\u2019s words. The man reminded her of her father. His contagious laugh and rosy cheeks were similar to that of the Baratheon king. Cutting the elk into pieces, Y/N placed them onto the fire. </p><p>\u201cAnd I did not need one drop of giant\u2019s milk.\u201d</p><p>Tormund bellowed with laughter at the girl\u2019s sarcasm. She was still a spitfire. That aspect had not changed.</p><p>Y/N had come to adapt to the Wildling lifestyle very quickly. Most of it not being that different to her adventures with Jon and Robb. Hunting, sparring, and amongst other training activities. She was more comfortable here than she had ever been under the gaze of her mother. No dresses in sight. Just thick furs and weapons. Jon would have fit right in, she thought. </p><p>Wiping her hands on her trousers, Y/N stood up, handing some already cooked food to Tormund. The man began to devour the food instantly. </p><p>\u201cI am going to give the rest of this food out to the ones who have yet to eat. So, don\u2019t think about eating my plate or else the last words out of your mouth would have been about how strong I am. Got it Tor?\u201d</p><p>The man held up a thumb, shoving the rest of his forkful into his mouth. He had learnt that the young woman did not kid when it meant food was involved.</p><p>Picking up the large box of prepared food, Y/N trudged out the camp and headed towards the groups of Wildlings she had left to feed. The women and children smiled at her arrival. The men nodding their heads in respect. She began to hand out the meals; blissfully unaware of Ygritte and many other Wildlings entering the camp with Jon Snow at their side. </p><p>\u201cHey Dongo?\u201d</p><p>The giant stopped hammering the pole at the sound of his name. He smiled once he saw it was Little Doe. Even the giants had come to care for the Baratheon. Everyone treated her as though she was a born and raised Wildling.</p><p>As Y/N\u2019s attention was aimed at feeding the giant, she failed to see the crow, behind the large beast, being ushered into the main tent. Grabbing a large slab of shank out of her box, she handed the meat to the giant. </p><p>\u201cIf you want anymore, Xera is also cooking in the tent over there. You\u2019ve worked really hard today.\u201d</p><p>The giant nodded in appreciation, watching as Y/N carried on weaving through the groups of Wildlings to feed the hungry.</p><p>\u201cI smell a crow.\u201d</p><p>Tormund had ceased eating once he felt the presence of a stranger in the tent. Ygritte stood to one side of Jon, as the Lord of Bones stood at the other. The man pulling of his mask as he spoke.</p><p>\u201cWe killed his friends. Thought you\u2019d want to question this one.\u201d</p><p>Tormund kept his back to the trio.</p><p>\u201cWhat do we want with a baby crow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis baby killed Qhorin Halfhand. He wants to be one of us.\u201d</p><p>At Ygritte\u2019s words, Tormund stood from his seat; staring at Jon.</p><p>\u201cThat half-handed cunt killed friends of mine. Friends twice your size.\u201d</p><p>Jon took deep breaths. Trying to not show his fear.</p><p>\u201cMy father told me big men fall just as quick as little ones if you put a sword through their hearts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlenty of little men tried to put their swords through my heart. And there\u2019s plenty of little skeletons buried in the woods. What\u2019s your name, boy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJon Snow.\u201d</p><p>Tormund\u2019s face changed to one of confusion. Having remembered a time when the Little Doe had mentioned a man named Jon. No last name. But it had been one of the few times she had talked so openly of her past. Of a boy she had grown besides, who had to leave to protect the place he lived.</p><p>Jon kneeled before Tormund, mistaking him for Mance Rayder, the King-beyond-the-Wall.</p><p>\u201cYour Grace.\u201d</p><p>The wildlings laughed, Tormund ignoring his thoughts.</p><p>\u201cYour Grace? Did you hear that? From now on, you\u2019d better kneel every time I fart.\u201d</p><p>With the Wildlings laughing, Mance Rayder appeared from the shadows, heading towards the crow.</p><p>\u201cStand, boy. We don\u2019t kneel for anyone beyond the Wall.\u201d</p><p>Jon raised to his feet, watching the man before him.</p><p>\u201cSo, you\u2019re Ned Stark\u2019s bastard. Thank you for the gift, Lord of Bones. You can leave us.\u201d</p><p>The lord of Bones left, Ygritte soon following in tow. As she exited the tent, Y/N approached the woman, food already in hand. </p><p>\u201cHere you go Ygritte. Just heard you had arrived back. With company as well. Who\u2019s the poor soul this time?\u201d</p><p>Ygritte smirked at the girl\u2019s words. Much like Tormund, the girl had spoken of a Jon. But had given no name. However, with the details she had told, Ygritte knew the man in the tent was the man Y/N had spoken about. Not wanting to give anything away, Ygritte took the food from the woman. </p><p>\u201cYou know, just some crow. We killed the rest. Thought this one could be useful, He\u2019s in there with Mance and Tormund. Head in if you like.\u201d</p><p>At the end of her words, Ygritte walked away, watching from her peripheral vision as Y/N began to walk into the tent.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014As she stood outside the tent, Y/N could hear Mance Rayder and Tormund tormenting the poor crow.</p><p>\u201cThe girl likes you. You like her back, Snow? That why you want to join us?\u201d</p><p>As she quietly stepped into the tent, Y/N body became rigid at the sight of dark black curls. It couldn\u2019t be.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t panic, boy. This isn\u2019t the damned Night\u2019s Watch where we make you swear off girls.\u201d</p><p>Tormund came to stand at the entrance, his face turning to see Y/N frozen in the doorway. Concern taking over his features.</p><p>\u201cThis chicken eater you thought was king is Tormund Giantsbane.\u201d</p><p>Jon refused to turn to look at the man; only until he saw Mance Rayder\u2019s expression change as well. </p><p>The leader of the Wildling\u2019s had also seen Y/N stand in the door. Both men worried at her reaction to the sight of the crow.</p><p>\u201cLittle Doe is there something wrong?\u201d</p><p>At the sound of the name, Jon\u2019s head whipped to the direction of the door. Only one person other than Sansa that he knew was called Little Doe.</p><p>For the first time in two years, Y/N and Jon was in each other\u2019s presence. Through loss, deceit, fear, they had gone through it all and were back together again. </p><p>\u201cY/N?\u201d</p><p>Tears sprung to her eyes at the sound of her name. She never thought she would the sound of her name so much. But she missed the man that spoke them more. </p><p>\u201cJon.\u201d</p><p>As she cried his name, the man strode towards the woman. Jon pulling her body flushed against his own. Clinging to each other with all their strength. Pulling the other tighter and tighter. Afraid to be ripped apart once more.</p><p>Pulling back just enough to look into his eyes, Y/N spoke to Jon for the first time in a long while.</p><p>\u201cI came to the wall after what had happened, and I stopped to rest. But then Tormund and the Wildlings came; warned me about the dangers beyond the wall. I\u2019ve been here since. I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t save Robb and Catelyn. I\u2019m so sorry Jon.\u201d</p><p>The girl cried. The sound broke the hearts of all three men. None of the Wildlings had ever seen or heard the woman cry. They weren\u2019t aware of the terrors she had fled when they had found her. </p><p>Jon wiped away the tears. His hand cupping Y/N\u2019s face, as the other continued to hold her waist; keeping her body close. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not your fault. You are a Baratheon, not a Lannister. You did not kill them.\u201d</p><p>The young woman hiccuped.</p><p>\u201cBut I didn\u2019t save them either. I should have tried harder.\u201d</p><p>Jon held her closer, trying to sooth the woman in his arms. </p><p>\u201cBaratheon?\u201d</p><p>Y/N ceased her sobbing at the sound of Tormund\u2019s voice. </p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d</p><p>Lifting her head from Jon\u2019s chest, she kept a firm grip of the man\u2019s furs, as she turned her head to where Tormund stood next to Mance Rayder. Tormund continuing to look confused, whilst Rayder\u2019s showed no expression. </p><p>Y/N sits down with the men and begins to explain to them her story. Of how she was meant to marry Robb Stark, the events of the Red Wedding, of all the hatred she held towards her mother and siblings. </p><p>\u201cI have felt more at home here and at Winterfell than I ever did in Kingslanding. The only reason I was still there was because I am the only pure born Baratheon and I was not going to leave my father. If you wish for me to leave, I will do so. But I never intended to harm you. In anyway, and I am sorry that I lied to you both, and the others.\u201d</p><p>Mance Rayder looked at Tormund, the man staring back. Their silent conversation being recognised by Jon as he came to sit next to Y/N. His body gravitating to sit as close as he possibly could. </p><p>The two men nodded towards the other. Looking back at the girl. </p><p>Mance Rayder spoke clearly to the woman.</p><p>\u201cYou have shown through your words and actions that you are no Lannister. That you are no coward. That you are a Wildling. Through and through. The only way you could be more Wildling is if Tormund had birthed you himself.\u201d</p><p>Y/N chuckled at his words.</p><p>\u201cThat is true.\u201d Tormund agreed.</p><p>\u201cYou are one of us. That will never change.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you Rayder.\u201d</p><p>The man smiled at the young woman. Taking that as his leave, he stood from his seat and walked towards the entrance. </p><p>\u201cSnow.\u201d</p><p>Jon looked at the man standing at the door.</p><p>\u201cWe shall discuss matters of you being here at a later time.\u201d</p><p>At the end of his words, Mance Rayder left the room, leaving the trio alone.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still our Little Doe. Still unstoppable with a bow and arrow and a fucking great cook.\u201d</p><p>Jon smiled at Tormund\u2019s words to Y/N. He was proud that she had been able to survive so long in the game that was being played. Away from most of the carnage, but still aware of the fight. That she had been able to gain respect from a group that many people in Westeros never dared to fight against.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Tormund. You are still my fire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye. You better tell that to your friend.\u201d</p><p>Tormund left the pair alone in the tent. His laughter becoming quieter and quieter the further he travelled away.</p><p>Turning to face Y/N, Jon threaded his fingers through her hair. Wanting to feel her presence as much as he could. Cupping his hands with her own, Y/N leant into his touch. Glad to feel the familiar touch of the man before her. </p><p>\u201cSo, tell me about the Watch? Have you finally made some friends, besides me and your family?\u201d</p><p>Jon chortled at her words. Y/N had always teased Jon about his lack of companions when they were growing up. As Robb and Theon grew older, they had many friends and even some women at their sides. Whereas it seemed Jon was content with only having her.</p><p>\u201cA young man called Samwell Tarly. He has become a great companion of mine. But all men of the Watch are brothers in arms. We have each other\u2019s backs.\u201d</p><p>A sullen look took over Y/N\u2019s features as she pulled her face away from Jon\u2019s caress. Worry instantly took over Jon at the sudden change in her demeanour.</p><p>\u201cAnd what would they make of you here with us Wildlings?\u201d</p><p>Jon huffed out a breath; unsure how to answer. </p><p>\u201cBut you are not a Wildling.\u201d</p><p>Y/N took great offense to her friend\u2019s statement.</p><p>\u201cYou heard Mance Rayder. I am a Wildling. Through and through. The only way I could be more Wildling is if Tormund had birthed me himself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cY/N, you are a Princess of House Baratheon and Lannister. You are meant to be in a castle, safe and away from all of this.\u201d</p><p>Y/N was hurt. Jon of all people should know how much she hated her life in Kingslanding.</p><p>\u201cYou know that I have never wished to be a princess. You know that one of the reasons I travelled with father to Winterfell so often was because the horrible torment I would have faced when he had gone.\u201d</p><p>Y/N rose to her feet, as her anger began to take over her emotions. Jon regretting his words as soon as he said them. Y/N\u2019s hands slammed on the table between them. </p><p>\u201cYou know that the place I felt safest was at Winterfell and that all went when Theon betrayed your brother. When your brother betrayed his vow. When my grandfather betrayed me. Sending men to kill us all. Your brother may have died. But I had to watch one of my best friends die at the hands of my uncle. I had to run as I knew that Cateyln, the only honest and caring woman in my life, be killed. Whilst you were in Castle Black. Having no idea of the atrocities I faced.\u201d</p><p>Y/N wiped her nose, as tears pricked her eyes once more. Looking away at the man in front of her. His saddened expression making her wish she wasn\u2019t so harsh. But she could not allow him to disrespect all she had been through.<br>\u201cThese people took me in. They could have left me to die, whilst I searched for you, but they didn\u2019t. They helped me grow as a warrior. If Ygritte and Tormund did not take me in, I would most likely be on the other side of that wall, with eyes as blue as the summer sky, and skin as cold as the ice.\u201d</p><p>Jon flinched at her words, at the idea of her being part of the dead beyond the wall. Standing from his seat, Jon strode around the table, moving to stand in front of Y/N, forcing the woman to look at him.</p><p>\u201cI am sorry. They were your family as much as they were mine. I cannot imagine the feelings you have felt. But I am here now, and I am going to make sure that you are safe.\u201d</p><p>Looking into his eyes, Y/N searched to see any lies. She loved Jon. More than she cared to admit, but they were a part of a game much bigger than the both of them, and that meant having to question the actions of those they loved. </p><p>Stepping closer, toe to toe, Jon could feel Y/N\u2019s breath on his face. His eyes momentarily closing at the feeling. </p><p>\u201cWill I be safe in Castle Black? Among the Nightswatch? Because I don\u2019t think I will.</p><p>Y/N left the room, allowing her words to linger in Jon\u2019s heart. His chest feeling heavy at the thought of Y/N feeling unsafe with him. But he knew it wasn\u2019t his presence that made her feel unsafe, but that of the Nightswatch. For as far as they, and everyone else in Westeros knew, Princess Y/N Baratheon was dead. And she was. For this new woman, sitting next to Wun Wun in the open camp, was not the same Baratheon that Jon had left in Winterfell. But Jon\u2019s heart still thumped as hard.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-</p><p>A few days after Jon\u2019s arrival at the camp, Mance Rayder ordered for Tormund to escort a group of Wildlings to attack Castle Black from the rear. Instructing Tormund to have Jon accompany him.</p><p>Tormund and the Wildlings had prepared to leave camp, when out of nowhere, Y/N appeared at Tormund\u2019s side. Cloaked and ready for the journey ahead. </p><p>\u201cYou are not coming Little Doe.\u201d</p><p>Y/N stared straight ahead, ignoring Tormund\u2019s words. </p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s right Y/N.\u201d</p><p>Jon slightly flinched at the glare she through his way.</p><p>\u201cI am still pissed off at you Snow. So, don\u2019t tell me that I would be safe at Castle Black, then tell me I cannot come with you. Because you will be proving yourself to be a liar.\u201d</p><p>Turning her head back forward, Y/N began to march forward with the Wildlings. Jon was frozen in his place. Staring as the woman walked at the front of the group, unafraid of what was out there. Turning his head, Jon realised that Tormund had ceased moving, much like Y/N, glaring at the man in question. Jon gulped. </p><p>\u201cYou better start walking crow. You\u2019ve already pissed off one Wildling today. Don\u2019t make it another.\u201d</p><p>Jon instantly began to walk, he and Tormund quickly catching up the group; situating themselves at the front once more.</p><p>It did not take long for things to go South. With Ygritte and Jon\u2019s near-death experience climbing the wall, to Jon refusing to kill the innocent man, Y/N had to step in. She may have been angry with Jon. But she was not going to watch him be killed.</p><p>\u201cTormund! Stop! You are not going to kill him.\u201d</p><p>As Y/N runs to aid Jon, Ygritte grabs her arms from behind; restraining the young woman.</p><p>\u201cYgritte if you were my friend, you would let me go.\u201d</p><p>Ygritte held on to Y/N\u2019s arms tighter.</p><p>\u201cI am not going to let you go because you are my friend, and you will make the wrong decision.\u201d</p><p>Out of nowhere, Summer and Shaggydog arrive at Jon\u2019s side. Greywind had been kept absent from the expedition due to the treacherous climbing and walking. They could not carry supplies for twenty plus Wildlings and a direwolf.</p><p>As Jon was fighting successfully against the Wildlings, with the help of the direwolves, Y/N fought excessively hard to get out of Ygritte\u2019s grip. Successfully doing so and grabbing her bow and arrow as well. Holding the arrow in the direction of Tormund and Ygritte, Y/N stepped closer towards Jon.</p><p>\u201cYou are not going to kill him!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a traitor. Still loyal to the Nightswatch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s my family and so are you. I am not losing anymore family\u2026\u201d</p><p>As Y/N held back the Wildlings, with Summer at her side, Jon successfully killed Orrell. Suddenly, an eagle swooped down to attack the man, clawing him across the face. Y/N turned at the commotion, running towards Jon, she whistled, causing a horse to approach. Placing her bow onto her back she pulled out her sword, swinging it back and forth to keep away the eagle and any approaching Wildlings.</p><p>\u201cGet on the horse now!\u201d</p><p>Jon slowly climbs onto the horse. He holds out his hand for Y/N to take. Looking sadly at the man, she ignored his hand.</p><p>\u201cOne day Jon Snow, we will see each other again.\u201d</p><p>Clapping the horse on the back leg, Y/N urged the stead to gallop away from the Wildlings. Jon watching as she was quickly restrained once more by the people she had called family. She had put herself in danger to save him. Jon would never forgive himself.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>Y/N\u2019s arms were bound tightly together. Gagged to stop her screams as Tormund ordered for Ygritte and other Wildlings to chase after Jon. \u00a0She fought and fought to free herself, but she could not fight no longer. Tormund carrying Y/N himself to their base to rest. Facing forward, he dared not to look down at the woman in his arms, hearing her soft broken cries caused his heart to replace the anger he felt at her actions to change to sadness at the sound of her tearful woes.</p><p><br>Jon cleaned his facial wounds in a small pool. His horse grazing nearby. He heard the sound of a bow being drawn, turning to see Ygritte, an arrow notched and aimed at him. Anger surges through her at the betrayal of the man. His betrayal to the Wildlings. To Y/N. Her friends.</p><p>\u201cYgritte, you know I didn\u2019t have a choice. \u00a0She always knew what I was. What I am. I have to go home now. I know you won\u2019t hurt me. Y/N wouldn\u2019t want you to hurt me.\u201d</p><p>Ygritte\u2019s hold on the bow began to loosen.</p><p>\u201cYou know nothing, Jon Snow. You know nothing of what you and her family have put her through.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do know some things. I know I love her.\u201d</p><p>Ygritte grunted, drawing her bow harder in rage.</p><p>\u201cI have loved her since we were children. I loved her when her father told her she was meant to marry my brother. I loved her when I left for the Watch. And I love her now. Through all she has been through. I love who she was and who she has become.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why did you betray her. Why did you betray us?\u201d</p><p>Jon paused with his words. Staring deep into Ygritte\u2019s eyes, seeing the blinding rage that she held towards him.</p><p>\u201cI have to make things right. To make it better for her.\u201d</p><p>Ygritte fought back tears at the thought of Jon taking away her friend. But also, for the fact he was leaving her once more. \u00a0Jon turned around, unaware, as Ygritte loosened an arrow into his shoulder. Jon fell to the ground, grunting in pain. \u00a0Notching another arrow, Ygritte watched as Jon lurched up and grabbed onto his horse. She hesitated. Not wanting to hurt him more than she had. He was right. Y/N would not want her to do this. But she had to.</p><p>Jon mounted his steed as Ygritte shot an arrow into his leg; crying out as he spurred on his horse. With her anger rising once more, Ygritte shot her third and final arrow, lodging it into the crow\u2019s back. If he were a target, it would be right on the bullseye. Cursing as she let the man gallop away.</p><p>When Ygritte arrived back to camp, her quiver empty, but no Jon in sight, Y/N wasn\u2019t sure if she had successfully killed the man and left him to other creatures beyond the wall, or if she had let him go. </p><p>Y/N sat next to Tormund, arms still secured behind her back. Her face void of any emotion. Ygritte went to walk past the woman but halted as words left the princess\u2019 mouth.</p><p>\u201cDid you kill him? If you were my friend, you could at least tell me that.\u201d</p><p>Ygritte looked at her friend, bound and sat on the floor. Like a slave. Like a prisoner. Nothing like one of their own. She hated to see her like this. But they had to be careful.</p><p>\u201cI did what I had to do.\u201d</p><p>Ygritte walked away from the woman, ignoring as her hunched shoulders went slack. Y/N no longer had the will to fight. Jon had betrayed her, the Wildlings had betrayed her, and she had betrayed them as well.</p><p>Y/N was kept detained for the time that the Wildlings prepared to invade the Black. Even though she had fought against them, Tormund and the Wildlings still cared for her. Becoming increasingly worried as she refused to speak and eat. All day and all night, she sat shackled, watching them prepare with a blank stare. Tormund could not deal with it no more. </p><p>Moving to sit next to the distant woman, Tormund dropped to the ground with a loud thud. Bringing a canter to her lips, he forced her to swallow.</p><p>\u201cYou are not dying because of that traitor, Little Doe. I understand why you did what you did. We forgive you.\u201d</p><p>Y/N shook her head at his words.</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t. I protected him. I haven\u2019t seen him for years, but the moment he goes against him, I was by his side. I turned against you when I should have stopped him.\u201d</p><p>Tormund drank from the canter, staring into the distant hills. The air was cold, but not as harsh as it had been before.</p><p>\u201cBut we do forgive you. People do all kinds of things for love.\u201d</p><p>Y/N scoffed.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t love him. Not anymore.\u201d</p><p>Tormund couldn\u2019t help but smile at the woman\u2019s malice filled words.</p><p>\u201cYes, you do Little Doe. You love him, and he loves you. Through all the changes and things that have done you wrong, you love each other. Between you, there is fire, scorching hot fire. It cannot be put out. But it can be made stronger.\u201d</p><p>Y/N processed Tormund\u2019s words. </p><p>Tormund left the woman to think. She knew of the raids that had occurred in the towns. Having been kept behind and guarded by a group of Wildlings as they had occurred. She knew that the siege of Castle Black was to occur that night. She had to prove to her Wildling family that she could be trusted. That she has always been and will be a Wildling.</p><p>Rolling onto her back, Y/N pushed herself forward, flipping onto her feet. Bending her knees to get used to the feeling of standing once more, Y/N casually strolled through the Wildlings and towards Mance Rayder and Tormund and they spoke with numerous wildlings about the battle that was about to commence.</p><p>Slowing to stand beside Tormund, she listens to the conversation. Hearing the plan of action, Y/N nods her head.</p><p>\u201cOkay, if someone can untie me, I\u2019ll grab my weapons and get prepared.\u201d<br>Tormund jumped at the new presence, unaware of the woman at his side.</p><p>\u201cYou are not coming.\u201d</p><p>Y/N turned her gaze to Mance, the man\u2019s steely eyes piercing her own.</p><p>Determined, Y/N easily pulled her hands free from her restraints. </p><p>Tormund looked between her hands and the girls face.</p><p>\u201cYou could have freed yourself? You could have escaped.\u201d</p><p>Y/N kept her gaze on Mance Rayder.</p><p>\u201cBut I didn\u2019t because I had to pay for what I did. I still do. Let me kill those bastards who changed the man I knew. The Jon I knew would never have lied of his word. He is probably dead now anyway. I will have to come to terms with that. So, Mance Rayder, please allow me to fight. To fight for the Wildlings.\u201d</p><p>Y/N knew he was alive. She knew Ygritte had not successfully killed him. The woman had overheard her words to Tormund. Her shots were calculated to hurt no kill. But Y/N had to, for once in her life, fight for family.</p><p>The man stayed quiet, the Wildlings around them waited for his reply, Ygritte, who was amongst the crowd, watched in anticipation. </p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Y/N\u2019s determined look fell.</p><p>\u201cYou will not fight for the Wildlings. You will fight with the Wildlings. With your family.\u201d</p><p>A cheer broke out amongst the camp. Y/N beamed with a smile. She was not going to disappoint them again. Not this time.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-</p><p>In Castle Black, Jon and his men prepared for the battle. Jon hoped that Y/N would not be there. That she would not fight. But he knew, that if the Wildlings had forgiven her, that he would see her right at Tormund\u2019s side. The battle could see the end of them both before they had even begun. <br>A horn was blown. The crows stood their stance, ready to fight. But then another horn was blown, and Jon knew, that she was there, ready to fight as well. </p><p>Swords were swung, and arrows were flown. Blood from both sides was spilled and bodies of brave men and Wildling women fell. Jon was right, Y/N never left Tormund\u2019s side, hacking and slashing all Nightsmen that came in their way. Taking a hit here and there, she entered the castle with Tormund, infiltrating from the inside.</p><p>Jon had just killed Styr when Ygritte had caught his attention. Her bow and arrow aimed at the Northern man. She slowly began to lower her bow.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s inside with Tormund. Get to her.\u201d</p><p>Jon nodded, going to thank Ygritte, when he felt the arrow fly past. Watching as it embedded into Ygritte\u2019s chest. He ran to her, clutching her body as her breaths became shallow.</p><p>\u201cJon Snow. Look after her. You love her, and she loves you.\u201d</p><p>Jon clutched Ygritte. He had made a friend in the sarcastic Wildling and he knew Y/N loved the woman as a sister.</p><p>\u201cNo Ygritte, she needs us both. She needs you.\u201d</p><p>Ygritte struggled for one last breath.</p><p>\u201cYou know nothing Jon Snow. She needs you more.\u201d</p><p>As the words left Ygritte\u2019s lips, her body went limp in Jon\u2019s arms. The man watched as Olly continued to fight. The bow still in his hands. Jon quickly carried Ygritte\u2019s body to a safe space, covering her up. Taking a breath, he turned to the castle, heading in the direction he had briefly seen Tormund run.</p><p>Tormund and Y/N were back to back, fighting off the guards that crowded them. They had heard the cheers of the Nights watch. But they were not giving up. Y/ was not giving up. Tormund had two arrows embedded into his back, and Y/N\u2019s left arm had taken a deep cut from one of the swords. Another scar to add to the rest. It was two Wildlings against many more crows.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s over. Let it end.\u201d</p><p>The pair looked to see Jon, deflated and broken. </p><p>\u201cThis is how a man ends.\u201d</p><p>As Tormund raised his sword, clashing it with one of the men of the Watch, Y/N\u2019s eyes widened in shock as she saw Jon reach for the cross bow. Aiming for Tormund\u2019s leg, Jon released the arrow. The arrow hit where Jon aimed. However, it was not embedded in Tormund\u2019s leg, but in Y/N\u2019s left leg. </p><p>Jon looks on, masking in horror, walking to kick Tormund to the ground. </p><p>Y/N\u2019s own legs collapsed from underneath her. The pain and exhaustion taking over.</p><p>\u201cPut him in chains, we will question him later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou hurt her any fucking more than you have, I will slice your throat boy.\u201d</p><p>Two crows did as Jon instructed. Tormund screaming as they dragged him away.</p><p>Jon turned to leave.</p><p>\u201cWhat about the girl?\u201d</p><p>Y/N glared at Jon. Her breaths heavy and long.</p><p>He could not risk her any harm. If he gave her leverage, then they could both be harmed.</p><p>\u201cPatch her up and take her to the cells.\u201d</p><p>Before they could grab a hold of her, Y/N pulled the arrow from her leg, throwing the object to the ground </p><p>She stood, allowing the soldiers to pull her hands behind her back.</p><p>\u201cLock me away, but I a not having your filthy feathered hands touch me. I would rather bleed out. You\u2019ve changed Jon Snow. This game. This war. It changed all of us. Some for good and some for bad.\u201d</p><p>Jon gulped down the tears. Hurt from her words. </p><p>\u201cI SHOULD HAVE DIED WITH THEM. BUT HE SENT ME TO FIND YOU. TO BE SAFE. AND LOOK WHAT FINDING YOU DID TO ME!</p><p>Jon knew she referred to his brother and Catelyn. Even though she was being locked away, she still kept her identity a secret; knowing it would harm his position. He would have been killed for hurting her. Hurting the Baratheon princess. But she would have rather died a Wildling than lived longer as a noble.</p><p>The crows held her tighter, escorting her the same way that Tormund had been led.</p><p>Jon did not move until he could see her no more. Only then did he leave for his chambers. Preparing for the next step. Though she hated him, he was doing this all for her. He hoped that it would work.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-</p><p>Whilst laying in their cells, Tormund and Y/N had been made aware of Ygritte\u2019s death. Screams and cries were heard from Tormund for days on end; for his fallen family. When men walked past Y/N\u2019s cell, they heard silence. Only Tormund heard the quiet cries at night. His own tears erupting once more. Crying for Ygritte and for the pain they both felt. She apologised over and over, and Tormund reassured her over and over again. It was not her fault. </p><p>Jon was soon named the 998th Lord Commander. The wildlings below unaware of their leader\u2019s death and to position Jon was going to take of asking for their help. During their time\u2019s in the cells, Y/N had become dormant. Hardly eating, sleeping, talking, or doing anything at all. Detached from all that was surrounding her. </p><p>When Jon came to free Tormund and herself, to help travel and save the remaining Wildlings. Jon had unsuccessfully tried to speak to Y/N; the girl simply ignoring him as she had everyone else. They were all worried for her health. </p><p>\u201cShe is too ill to travel.\u201d</p><p>Tormund glanced at the woman in the cell, debating Jon\u2019s words.</p><p>\u201cIf she has to stay in this hell hole, at least get that large friend of yours to help her health.\u201d</p><p>Jon nodded his head. </p><p>Walking to Y/N\u2019s cell, Jon crouched at the gates. The woman stared blankly at the floor. She seemed lifeless, but the expanding of her chest proved otherwise.</p><p>\u201cI know I have changed. We both have. But I am doing this all for you. So, you can have the life you deserve. Away from all this shit that has happened. You cannot die. You did not die then, and you won\u2019t now. So, for once, you are staying here, and you are going to accept help. Samwell we come down to get you better and keep you company. I wish I could home you in proper chambers, but they would kill you if I did. We will be back soon.\u201d</p><p>Y/N slowly lifted her head as Jon spoke. Taking in his words. The two stared at each other in silence. Her eyes flickered to Tormund\u2019s figure.</p><p>\u201cKeep him safe Torm. Keep yourself safe too.\u201d</p><p>Tormund smiled, glad to hear his Little Doe speak again. He had missed her voice. </p><p>\u201cAye,I am a Giantsbane. We will be all right. Ain\u2019t that right boy?\u201d</p><p>Jon nodded, still holding his gaze on Y/N. Even as they left the dungeons, the man never wavered his look from her. He saw her lie on the floor as they left. Falling to sleep.</p><p>Jon informed Samwell of his commands, making sure that he kept it private between the two. He did not want anyone else to question why she was having assistance. Samwell took the orders with no hesitation or question. Instantly going into action, the minute that Jon and the other Wildlings left.</p><p>Everyday Sam would force Y/N to eat and drink. Checking her wounds, bringing her fresh furs and even cleaning her own. Doing all he could to make sure she became healthy again. For a while, it was only Sam talking to fill up the silence. He spoke of his life before the watch, to his opinions on pointless things, to information of the houses. Y/N hid her amusement when he recited the history of House Baratheon to the woman. Still unaware of who she was. To him, she was a Wildling with hardly a clue of the history of the houses. Of what had occurred within the kingdoms. Or so she thought. Samwell was a smart man. Smarter than he looked.</p><p>\u201cJon told me stories of when King Robert and Princess Y/N Baratheon would visit Winterfell. Of how close he was to the princess.\u201d</p><p>Y/N\u2019s ears perked up at Sam\u2019s words. Clearing her throat, she spoke to the young man for the first time.</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of stories?\u201d</p><p>To say Sam was shocked was an understatement. </p><p>\u201cWell, he spoke of how they met and all the trouble they caused with his brother, Robb. Of how devastated he was when he heard that King Robert and Eddard Stark had agreed for her to marry his brother. How it confirmed his reasoning of joining the watch.\u201d</p><p>Y/N pulled the thin blanket around her tighter. Her frame had become similar to how it was before, but she still did not fit her furs as she did before. </p><p>\u201cIf the betrothal had not been agreed then he would have stayed in Winterfell?\u201d</p><p>Sam nodded.</p><p>\u201cPrecisely.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThat bastard. He left because of Robb and I. He knew I never loved him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew it.\u201d</p><p>Y/N froze at Sam\u2019s explanation. All this time she had been able to hide who she was, and this oaf had reeled it out of her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the princess.\u201d</p><p>Y/N drank from the cup at her side. Placing it back down, she leaned her head on the concrete wall, turning to look at Sam, who sat on the other side of the bars. On a stool, holding his own drink.</p><p>\u201cWell, you going to kill me? Sell me for ransom and bribery?\u201d</p><p>Sam shook his head in a comical manner. The girl quirked an eyebrow. From the time he had spent tending to her, she had come to realise that Samwell\u2019s actions were pure. But she could not help but pull up her guard.</p><p>\u201cI wold never. I had my suspicions when Jon asked me to tend to you that you meant something to him. But it was not until you began to eat once more, and your face began to fill out, that I recognised your features. You look very different to your siblings yet so much like your mother and father. You have her beauty and his dark hair and eyes.\u201d</p><p>It had been a long time since Y/N had heard of her father or had been compared to him. She ignored the comments of her siblings and Cersei. But to hear that someone could recognise her as her father\u2019s child made her smile once more. <br>\u201cJon asked me to look after you. And that I will. I will do anything to make Princess Y/N Baratheon better once more.\u201d</p><p>Sam\u2019s words brought tears to Y/N\u2019s eyes. Not of sadness or pain like she had cried for the times that have passed. But tears of gratitude. She felt for the first time, in a long time, happy to hear her name. To hear her father\u2019s house and her name together. Even through all she had fought, Y/N truly believed her father would have been proud.</p><p>By the time that Jon, Tormund and many of the Wildlings had returned, Y/N was better and nearly stronger than ever. Sam had successfully convinced to be placed on full time guard duty of the Wildling woman. Helping her repair and get better. Sam confided in Y/N of his desires to become a maester. The woman encouraged him to do so, reminding him to not forget about Gilly and the child he has come to love as his own.</p><p>Sam travelled to library, where Jon sat, waiting for the news of Y/N\u2019s condition.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s better. She eats well, sleeps well, talks quite a lot.\u201d</p><p>Jon let out a small chuckle. Remembering of all the times she talked his ears off growing up.</p><p>Sam relied all of her improvements. Before mentioning his desires to leave. To become a maester. Remembering both Gilly and Y/N\u2019s encouraging words.</p><p>Jon stared at Sam, saying nothing.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be more use to you as a Maester. More use to everyone now that Maester Aemon\u2019s gone. The Citadel has the world\u2019s greatest library. I\u2019ll learn about history, strategy, healing. And other things. Things that will help when they come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf Gilly stays here then she\u2019ll die. And the baby that she named after me will die. And I\u2019ll end up dying, too, trying to protect them. Which means that the last thing that I\u2019ll see in this world will be the look in her eyes when I fail them. (pause) I\u2019d rather see a thousand White Walkers than see that.\u201d</p><p>Jon inhaled and exhaled. Nodding somberly, allowing Sam to go.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>The men continued to discuss Sam\u2019s relationship with Gilly and what it would mean for him to become a maester.</p><p>They sit in silence for a moment.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll come back. You\u2019re not my only friend anymore. I have you and Princess Y/N to visit.\u201d</p><p>Jon\u2019s head whipped up at Sam\u2019s words. </p><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d</p><p>Sam smiled faintly. </p><p>\u201cAll the times you spoke of her, `and how you were so adamant of a particular Wildlings safety rang bells in my mind. Then when she was getting better, she looked more Baratheon every day. I asked, and she replied. Told me all that had happened since she was reported dead. Well, since your brother passed.\u201d</p><p>Jon looked towards the doors. Pondering on whether to leave to see her. He had been wanting to since he arrived. No doubt Tormund had already re-laid all that had happened, to her.</p><p>\u201cGo. She may act like she does not want to see you. But she does. She spoke the most when your name was brought up in conversation.\u201d</p><p>Jon stood from his seat, bringing his friend into a hug. </p><p>\u201cTo you return.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo my return.\u201d</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-<br>Jon travelled to the cells where Y/N still stayed. Without an explanation, he unlocked the door. If the rest of the Wildlings were roaming around Castle Black, so should she. </p><p>Startled at the sudden noise, Y/N sat up from her position on the ground. Watching with baited breath as Jon yanked open the metal bars. Her time in the cells, and with Samwell, had left her hours to think long and hard about how she felt. How she felt about the game. How she felt about friends. How she felt about Jon. And how she felt about herself. She did not want to become a bitter woman. Y/N knew that Jon was doing what he thought was right. He always had. The man may have caused her pain and sorrow. But he was her best friend. He was her Jon.</p><p>Jon bent down to sit near Y/N, leaning his back against the wall, he left space between them. Trying to show that he did not want to over step any boundaries. </p><p>Without a word, Y/N scooted closer to Jon, so that their arms touched. Neither moved their gazes from the wall in front of them. Slowly, Y/N laid her head on his shoulder. </p><p>The pair sat there in silence for a long period of time. Basking in the shared company. It had been the first time in years that Jon and Y/N had been able to sit together, without talking about what had happened to them or what was going to happen next.</p><p>Ever so gently, Jon placed his right hand over Y/N\u2019s left. Interlocking their fingers, he stroked the back of the woman\u2019s hand. Basking in the small pieces of affection. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re back.\u201d</p><p>Jon smiled at her words. He was not sure if Sam\u2019s words were true. If she still cared for him.</p><p>\u201cSo am I. You can wonder freely around the castle now. You can share my chambers, if you would like. I know you don\u2019t feel relatively safe amongst the other men of the Watch.\u201d</p><p>Y/N pondered his invitation. Snuggling closer to Jon, she tightened her hold on his hand.</p><p>\u201cYeah. I would appreciate that a lot Jon. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would do anything to keep you safe.\u201d</p><p>Y/N tilted her head to stare into Jon\u2019s own eyes. Entranced by the other, their bodies moved closer together. Y/N laying practically on top of Jon.</p><p>\u201cAnd so, would I.\u201d</p><p>They stayed in the cells for the rest of the night. Enjoying the silence and each other\u2019s company. Cuddled in an embrace, Y/N and Jon fell asleep, wrapped around each other.</p><p>What they had been unaware of was little Olly slowly creeping down the cellar during their moment. Seeing his Lord Commander spread across the Wildling woman made the lads blood boil. He had lost his family, his village, his home, all to those foul monsters. And now the watch had lost their leader. A traitor. That is what Jon Snow was.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-And a traitor\u2019s death Jon was given. Sitting in his chambers, Y/N had left mere minutes earlier to speak to Tormund about increasing her training once more, now that she had been healed better. Jon\u2019s face was still flushed from the surprising kiss on the cheek from the woman. The unexpected affection causing the colour to travel across his face. </p><p>It soon disappeared when Olly quickly knocked on his chamber door, breathlessly explaining to Jon how Y/N had fallen down the steps when rushing to find Tormund. How she had heard a crack and could not move her right leg. Jon quickly left his chambers, following Olly who told him that Thorne was with the woman, who had refused any help unless Jon was there.</p><p>But what Jon had arrived to was not Y/N on the ground in pain with Thorne at her side. But Y/N held captive by Thorne; surrounded by members of the watch. The woman was gagged and shackled. The same she had been when the Wildlings lost the Battle of Castle Black.</p><p>Jon sees the woman crying. Turning to ask Thorne what the meaning of this all was, before Jon\u2019s words could leave his mouth, Thorne plunged a knife into his stomach. Y/N\u2019s screams ringing loud, even with the gag in her mouth. </p><p>With a hand on his stomach, Jon quickly manouvered to reach the woman. The loss of blood causing him to stumble. Just before he could reach her, Yarwyck, Marsh and two other black brothers proceed to stab Jon. Each dedicating their action \u2018For the Watch.\u2019 Jon dropped to his knees, swaying as he watched Y/n thrash against the men who held her captive. Her gag falling loose.</p><p>\u201cStop. Stop it now!\u201d</p><p>Thorne moved to stand behind Y/N, his dagger held tightly to her throat. When she gulped, she could feel the blade digging into her neck. </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t hurt her. She did nothing wrong.\u201d</p><p>Thorne sneered at Jon.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a Wildling. Everything she does is wrong.\u201d</p><p>Blood soaked Jon\u2019s armour. </p><p>\u201cShe is Princess Y/N Baratheon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am a Wildling. Born and bred.\u201d</p><p>Jon looked into Y/N\u2019s eyes. Tears falling from both his and her own.</p><p>If he was going to die, she was not going to let him save her. She was not going to allow the title she despised to kill the man she loved and save her life.</p><p>And as Olly laid down the final blow, stabbing Jon in the heart, the last thing he saw was was Thorne, a man he had come to respect and follow, slice the blade across Y/N\u2019s neck. </p><p>Their bodies falling to the ground simultaneously. Neither breathing. Neither alive. The blood poring out their bodies, and down the small dips in the snow, connecting the two puddles together. Even in death, Y/N and Jon were connected.</p><p>With a sign above Jon\u2019s head, labelling him a traitor, and a sign above Y/N\u2019s labelling her a savage. The men of the watch dismembered, leaving the bodies to be found in the morning.</p><p>And as the pair lay dead, Greywind and Ghost howled to the air, alerting Davos, Edd and his men about the bodies that laid in the snow. The group quickly bringing them into their quarters, with Greywind and Ghost protecting the door. </p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have the numbers.\u201d</p><p>Edd looked at Davos in contemplation.</p><p>\u201cWe have two direwolves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not enough. I didn\u2019t know Lord Commander Snow for long, but I have to believe he wouldn\u2019t have wanted his friends to die for nothing. Speaking for Princess Y/N Baratheon, those men have killed an heir to the throne. Our Lord Commander\u2019s partner. Our friend in arms. She will not die for nothing.\u201c</p><p>\u201cIf you were planning to see tomorrow, you picked the wrong room. We all die today. I say we do our best to take Thorne with us when we go.\u201d</p><p>Davos began to feel frustrated at Edd\u2019s words.</p><p>\u201cWe need to fight, but we don\u2019t need to die. Not if we have help.\u201d</p><p>The men in the room murmured amongst them.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s gonna help us?\u201d questioned one of the Nightswatch. </p><p>Davos looked across the faces in the room.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not the only ones who owe your lives to Jon Snow. Once they find out one of their own has been killed, they will come fighting and swinging. For Y/N may have been a princess, but she has a wilder family that lay closer to her heart.\u201d</p><p>Realisation swept over Edd. He turned to the Night\u2019s Watchman at his side.</p><p>\u201cBolt the door. Don\u2019t let anyone in. I\u2019ll be back as soon as I can.\u201d</p><p>Edd exited the room. The man swiftly and quietly left the room, heading down the halls and out the castle to the man who could help them. For now, they needed the help of the Wildlings.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-Ash. All she could see was ash covering the grounds of Kingslanding. Of her home. The sound of screams and burning fire growing louder by the second. As the screams become louder, her vision started to blur. With the Red Keep in the distance falling to the ground; fire encompassing the building. Just before the darkness took over, Y/N heard a single word, over the screams and the terrifying sound of burning. As clear as day, a single word; Dracarys.</p><p>Y/N gasped as her eye\u2019s shot open. Taking in the cold and chilly air around her, it quickly came to Y/N\u2019s attention how exposed she was. Feeling a nudging of her hand, Y/N turned her head to see Greywind at the side of the pillar in which she laid. A blanket held softly between his teeth. </p><p>Slowly sitting up, Y/N took the blanket from the direwolf, wrapping it around herself securely. Her body felt extremely cold; like a corpse. How could she be alive? Jon\u2019s men stabbed her. Looking down to her stomach, Y/N could see the angry red scars of where her stab wounds were. The last thing she remembered, before her dream, was Olly killing Jon. </p><p>Jon? Was he alive or dead? Y/N had no idea. As she began to panic, air leaving her lungs at a rapid pace, the door of the room creaked open. Twisting her head to look at the figure, she watched as Tormund stood in the doorway in shock. </p><p>\u201cTormund.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLittle Doe!\u201d</p><p>The man rushed into the room. Coming to help Y/N as she weakly stood from the pillar. Engulfing his arms around the small woman, she went to hug him back. Until she remembered her exposed state.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m kind of naked Tormund, so I cannot really reciprocate.\u201d</p><p>Tormund squeezed the Baratheon princess harder before letting go.</p><p>\u201cIt is only skin Little Doe. You are as naked as the day you were born. You should feel powerful.\u201d</p><p>The woman laughed.</p><p>\u201cI feel as though I was stabbed multiple times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because you were.\u201d</p><p>At the sound of the new voice, Y/N watched as Melisandre entered through the doors. The dark red head gracefully walked through the doors and travelled to stand next to Tormund. </p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s the witch that brought you and Jon back. I always say those kissed by fire had special powers.\u201d</p><p>Tormund laughed at his own words. </p><p>Y/N could not help the shock in her body. She had died and been brought back to life. But so, had Jon.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Jon? I want to see Jon.\u201d</p><p>Tormund ceased his laughter at Y/N\u2019s desperate pleas. </p><p>\u201cI will get him for you.\u201d</p><p>Tormund gave the woman another comforting hug. </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry Little Doe. He\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>Releasing Y/N, Tormund headed to the door. Leaving the two women in the room alone. </p><p>Y/N felt the red witches gaze on her body. Pulling the blanket tighter around her, she felt Greywind move closer; sensing his owner\u2019s discomfort.</p><p>\u201cYou hold great power.\u201d</p><p>Y/N looked towards the woman. Confusion written across her expression. </p><p>Melisandre stepped closer to the Baratheon.</p><p>\u201cPower so pure that mystic creatures will fall at your feet in awe. That even the darkest of heart will not be able to hurt.\u201d</p><p>The pair stared at each other in silence until the door opened once more. This time it was Jon who would walk through. </p><p>\u201cY/N.\u201d</p><p>Hearing her name from his mouth brought tears to her eyes. The images of seeing him stabbed by the men of the watch tumbled through her mind.</p><p>\u201cJon.\u201d</p><p>She sobbed as the man rushed through the doorway and encircled his arms around her body. </p><p>As Jon held Y/N, Melisandre exited the room. Her words hanging heavily in Y/N\u2019s soul. She could not think of them now. Because Jon was alive. They were both alive. </p><p>Y/N rose her arms, to encircle them around Jon, when she suddenly realised again, she was exposed. </p><p>\u201cJon, I would love to reciprocate this hug, but I am naked.\u201d</p><p>The man instantly let go. A blush covering his entire face and neck. He turned to see a set of clothes on the chair closest to the door. Quickly grabbing them, he handed them to the woman. Turning, once again, to face away as she began to dress.</p><p>Once she was fully dressed, Y/N walked towards the Stark bastard, wrapping her arms around his torso. Spinning in her hold, placed his arms onto her waist.</p><p>\u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d</p><p>The girl winced at his question.</p><p>\u201cSore. Tired. Probably the same as you. How long have you been alive again for?\u201d</p><p>Jon looked at the ceiling, thinking of all that had happened since he had awoken. </p><p>\u201cA while. We thought you weren\u2019t going to awaken. I\u2019ve dealt with Olly and the men who did this to us.\u201d</p><p>Y/N nodded her head, silently glad she was not present for the execution. </p><p>\u201cAnd I have handed over Castle Black to Edd.\u201d</p><p>Now that surprised her. </p><p>Looking up at the man, she could not formulate words. </p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause the Watch is not my home. We are going to take back Winterfell. Take back our home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou, I, and Sansa.\u201d</p><p>Y/N placed her arms on Jon\u2019s shoulders, staring her friend in the eyes. </p><p>\u201cSansa\u2019s here?\u201d</p><p>Jon grabbed onto Y/N\u2019s hand, guiding her through the halls ever so slowly. The woman still getting used to the feeling of being alive once more. Her headache slowly dissipating and her legs becoming sturdier. Turning around the corner, Jon opened a door to a dining hall. The room full of many unfamiliar faces eating, and a few familiar ones.</p><p>Jon lead Y/N to the table which seated Sansa, Tormund, Edd, Brienne, and Podrick. All of their heads turning to the commotion of the pair entering the room. Murmurs becoming louder as many men of the watch saw Y/N alive. Much like their Lord Commander, brought back from the dead for a reason.</p><p>Sansa stood from her seat at the site of the Baratheon princess. All of them being informed of what had happened to her and Jon. For the more days had passed, the more they thought she would not return.</p><p>Letting go of Jon\u2019s hand, Y/N embraced the young Stark woman; glad to see she had survived her tormented family.</p><p>\u201cI am sorry for what that cunt Joffrey did to your father; and to you.\u201d</p><p>Sansa grasped Y/N tighter.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I survived. And the moment was splendid. But I had to leave as quickly as I could. Joffrey has been the smallest of my troubles thus far.\u201d</p><p>Sansa pulled Y/N to sit down, with Jon moving to sit at her other side. </p><p>Y/N looked in front of her to the unfamiliar pair. However, one was more unfamiliar than the other.</p><p>\u201cPodrick Payne?\u201d</p><p>Startled, Podrick looked to the young woman. </p><p>\u201cYes, m\u2019lady?\u201d</p><p>Y/N let out a cheerful laugh.</p><p>\u201cMy god. You\u2019re alive. And you\u2019re no longer attached to my uncle\u2019s side. What happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was trailed for treason m\u2019lady. For Joffrey\u2019s murder. He did not do it. But he did not want me to be brought down with him, so he handed me to Brienne of Tarth.\u201d</p><p>Y/N looked to the woman at his side. Amazement beaming in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou were sworn to the kingsguard of my uncle Renly.\u201d</p><p>Brienne looked surprise at the amazement on the princess\u2019 face and at her knowledge.</p><p>\u201cThat is right m\u2019lady.\u201d</p><p>Y/N smirked at the woman.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need to be shocked. I made sure I knew everyone who was associated with my family. Even after I left Kingslanding and Winterfell. I still found my ways to know. The only reason I don\u2019t know now is because I died.\u201d</p><p>The table went awkwardly silent. </p><p>Y/N rolled her eyes.</p><p>\u201cLighten up. I am alive aren\u2019t I. You will need to tell me everything later. I need to know it all. I am just glad that everyone here is safe. I do hope Arya, Bran and Rickon have survived as well.\u201d</p><p>Sansa looked towards Jon.</p><p>\u201cThe Bolton\u2019s have Rickon.\u201d</p><p>Anger surged through Y/N\u2019s veins. It seemed that this war would never end. </p><p>\u201cWe will get him back, I promise. We will get back Winterfell, we will find Bran and Arya, and we will end this war.\u201d </p><p>Determination laced the Baratheon\u2019s tone. The group startled at the woman\u2019s words. But slowly, one by one, they raised their glasses, ready to fight for this battle.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-<br>A battle is what they fought victoriously against Ramsay Bolton and his men. Y/N refused to stand a side; fighting on the battle field. With Podrick and Brienne having travelled to Riverrun at the command of Sansa, Y/N made sure to protect Sansa with all her might. Even escorting her to the dungeons as she unleashed the hounds onto Ramsay. Watching from the side as the man who had defiled her friend, die at the paws of his hounds. </p><p>Y/N watched on as Jon named Sansa the Lady of Winterfell. She watched on as Jon was claimed King of the North. But she refused to watch on as Jon prepared to leave for Dragonstone to meet the Khaleesi.</p><p>\u201cI am coming with you and that is final. My uncle is alive. He sent the letter. I want to see him, and I am not leaving you.\u201d</p><p>Jon raised his head to the sky, becoming quickly frustrated with the woman in front of him.</p><p>\u201cWhat happens if this goes south?\u201d</p><p>Y/N huffed at the man in front of her, crossing her arms.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re in the North, wherever we go will go South. Except for Castle Black, and we\u2019ve only just come back from there.\u201d</p><p>Jon was not in the mood for her smart mouth. </p><p>The pair continued to bicker, unaware of those that watched on.</p><p>\u201cThis sounds familiar.\u201d</p><p>Sansa giggled at Tormund\u2019s words, having heard a similar conversation occur multiple times between the pair.</p><p>\u201cThis was my life before we left. If they were not causing trouble for each other, they were causing trouble for everyone else. Usually with Robb beside them.\u201d</p><p>Tormund nodded his head. </p><p>\u201cAnd he still has not admitted his love for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Neither has she for him.\u201d</p><p>Sansa could not help but scoff at the duo\u2019s ideocracy.</p><p>\u201cJon I am not letting you leave again. We are both alive for a reason.\u201d</p><p>Jon grasped the woman\u2019s shoulder with his right hand. Bending his head slightly so that they were eye level.</p><p>\u201cAnd I want to keep you alive. That is why you are not coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWatch me.\u201d</p><p>Before she could even try to walk away, Y/N was yanked back by Jon. Being pulled flush against his chest as his lips slammed into her own.</p><p>Sansa and Tormund looked on in surprise.</p><p>\u201cWe spoke too soon.\u201d</p><p>Y/N moved her hands to tangle into Jon\u2019s hair. His own hand\u2019s gravitating towards her lower waist. The lips locked in a passionate embrace; exerting years of pent up emotion. Love, frustration, desire, sadness, and more rolled into this one action between the pair. Their lungs begging for air as they simultaneously broke the kiss. The space between their bodies not moving an inch. Both their chests heaved for breath. Y/N biting her swollen lip as Jon\u2019s lust filled gaze stared into her own.</p><p>\u201cThat was long overdue.\u201d</p><p>Jon chuckled at Y/N\u2019s words.</p><p>\u201cI would say so.\u201d</p><p>In her peripheral vision, Y/N could see Sansa smirking at the pair with Tormund at her side; a beaming smile on the man\u2019s face. </p><p>Shaking her head, with a smile permanently fixed, Y/N gazed at the man in front of her. </p><p>\u201cI am coming with you. A kiss like that gives me even more reasons to be at your side. Don\u2019t want you falling in love with this Dragon Queen, now do I?\u201d</p><p>Jon groaned, throwing his head back at the woman\u2019s words; continuing to over react as it caused the woman he loved to laugh.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>With her hands still in his hair, Y/N pulled his head back to her own. Their foreheads leaning on one another. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not getting rid of me again Jon Snow.\u201d</p><p>Jon smiled back at Y/N.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t intend to.\u201d</p><p>Y/N simply smiled back.</p><p>Hopping aboard the boat with Jon and Davos, the trio prepared to set sail to Dragonstone. To meet the Queen of Dragons and to take the next step in the Game of Thrones.\u00a0</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-<br>The trio sailed for weeks before they arrived. Y/N and Jon having become like their younger selves once more. Causing mischief for one another and for Davos. The man could not believe his eyes; seeing the Baratheon princess and the Stark bastard act so care free. He let them be, for once they would arrive to Dragonstone, all carefree antics would be out the window once more. </p><p>Looking into the crystal blue waters, Y/N breathed in the crisp see air. Jon moving to stand behind her, his hands encircling her waist as he laid his chin on her shoulder. </p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve survived this far. Do you think we will make it home?\u201d</p><p>Y/N\u2019s words were serious and deeply questioning. She wasn\u2019t sure herself if they would make it home. If the Queen would comply with their plan.</p><p>Jon\u2019s hands squeezed Y/N tighter to his chest. Her own hands raising to place over his, stroking her thumb across the rough, calloused skin. Bending his head down, Jon placed a kiss on her neck. Keeping his head in the crook of her neck as he breathed deeply in and out. He had taken accustom to doing so when he wanted to be reminded that she was here. Truly here with him. For he had imagined her touch so many times, that it took more than her hold to bring to reality that she was her; at his side.</p><p>\u201cI will do anything I can for us to make it home. To make it back to Winterfell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhether its Winterfell, Castle Black, or even further North of this world, as long as you, Greywind and Tormund are by my side, I know I will be okay.\u201d</p><p>The pair stared out into the ocean; allowing the silence to encompass them. </p><p>A mere few days later, the trio arrived at Dragonstone. Docking the ship at the harbour, Jon and Davos walked down the ramp of the ship to meet their awaiting company. Y/N staying on the ships a few minutes longer; making sure that all was secure for the journey home. Stood at the end of the dock was not only Y/N\u2019s uncle Tyrion, but Missandei and Greyworm; ready to escort the guests to their queen.</p><p>\u201cThe bastard of Winterfell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe dwarf of Casterly Rock.\u201d</p><p>Tyrion and Jon both stared at each for a moment, quickly breaking into smiles. They stepped forward and shook hands.</p><p>\u201cI believe we last saw each other on top of the wall.\u201d</p><p>Jon chuckled, remembering the moment ever so clearly.</p><p>\u201cYou were pissing off the edge, if I remember right. You picked up some scars along the road.\u201d</p><p>Tyrion nodded his head in agreement.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a long road. But we\u2019re both still here.\u201d</p><p>Turning to address Davos, Tyrion introduced himself to the gentleman.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Tyrion Lannister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDavos Seaworth.\u201d</p><p>The pair shook hands in acknowledgement.</p><p>\u201cAh, the Onion Knight. We fought on opposite sides at the Battle of Blackwater Bay.\u201d</p><p>Davos chortled.</p><p>\u201cUnluckily for me.\u201d</p><p>Moving a step backwards, Tyrion introduced Missandei to the two guests. The woman bowing her head in respect to the two men.</p><p>\u201cWelcome to Dragonstone. Our queen knows this is a long journey. She appreciates the effort you have made on her behalf. If you wouldn\u2019t mind handing over your weapons.\u201d</p><p>Jon looked at Davos and his men.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not giving over my weapons. No fucking way. Not whilst we are on foreign land.\u201d</p><p>The men and woman all turned to the sound of the new voice.</p><p>Y/N walked her way down the plank and to her accompanying men. Head held high, she situated herself to the right of Jon. Making it clear she was not letting go of her bow and arrow, or her sword. Her hand holding it tightly as it laid sheathed at her side.</p><p>Tyrion did not recognise his niece as she travelled closer to group. The face only becoming familiar once she ceased her steps, standing alongside the bastard of Winterfell. The last he had seen of her was before she and her family departed for Winterfell. Her dark brown hair long and luxurious like her mothers. She had been draped in the colours of both House Lannister and Baratheon. Now, as she stood before him, her hair laid half up and half down; slightly shorter than it had been before. Her body draped under fur upon fur; mixtures of browns, greys, and tans. She stood taller, stronger, more prepared for danger. Nothing like the innocent Baratheon he had last seen. Her face scarred from not only the Red Wedding but from the dangers she had faced whilst playing the Game of Thrones.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re alive?\u201d</p><p>Y/N could not help but chuckle at her uncle\u2019s shock. She knew her family thought of her as dead. Her where about had not been recorded since the destruction of the Red Wedding. Not until now anyways.</p><p>\u201cAs are you uncle Tyrion. Seems we both took a hit to the face.\u201d</p><p>The man touched his scarred cheek, staring directly at the one that laid across the right side of Y/N\u2019s face. Slightly pink due to the rough wind and cold breeze.</p><p>\u201cWhilst you were scarred in battle, I was scarred in a massacre. At the order of my own grandfather.\u201d</p><p>Tyrion looked guiltily to the ground. Keeping his gaze fixed to the floor, he replied to his dearest niece.</p><p>\u201cI took care of him.\u201d</p><p>Y/N refused to drop her anger fuelled expression. She may have loved her uncle Tyrion, but to see a member of her family for the first time in so long, brought forward the repressed hatred she held towards her mother, grandfather, and other Lannister\u2019s involved.</p><p>\u201cI know. He deserved what he got. He should never have treated you the way that he did.\u201d</p><p>Tyrion raised his head in surprise. Staring at the woman before him.</p><p>\u201cHe should have never called the order of the Red Wedding.\u201d</p><p>As the group became silence over the woman\u2019s malice filled words, Jon placed his hand on top of her own. Squeezing it ever so slightly; motioning that he was there for her. She squeezed back.</p><p>Missandei stepped forward, standing slightly behind Tyrion. </p><p>\u201cThe Khaleesi wishes to speak to you all at once of your arrival. But first, your weapons please.\u201d</p><p>Y/N went to argue once more, only choosing not due to the look she gained from both Jon and her uncle. She felt like a teenager again. Huffing she pulled her bow and arrows from her back and unclipped her sword from her waist. Handing them over to the leader of the Unsullied.</p><p>\u201cYou better not damage them. Wildlings don\u2019t have luxuries, like a Queen, to buy new weapons when one is broken.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWildlings? I thought you were a princess?\u201d</p><p>Y/N smiled at Missandei\u2019s confusion.</p><p>\u201cI was a princess. Not anymore.\u201d</p><p>Missandei continued forward.</p><p>Davos, Y/N and Jon followed the woman on the path to where the Queen awaited. Tyrion and Greyworm trailing at the rear. </p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-Jon, Y/N and Davos approached the throne room as Dothraki guards opened the doors to allow them entrance. Coming to a halt, the group cannot help but stare at the sight of the Khaleesi, sitting highly on the intricate throne. </p><p>\u201cYou stand in the presence of Daenerys Stormborn of House Targaryen, rightful heir to the Iron Throne, rightful Queen of the Andals and the First Men, Protector of the Seven Kingdoms, the Mother of Dragons, the Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea, The Unburnt, The Breaker of Chains.\u201d</p><p>At Missandei\u2019s words, Jon turned and looked at Davos.</p><p>\u201cThis is Jon Snow. He\u2019s King in the North.\u201d</p><p>Tyrion could not help but smirk. Neither could his niece.</p><p>\u201cThank you for traveling so far, My Lords. I hope the seas weren\u2019t too rough. And who may this be accompanying you both? I was only made aware of the presence of male guests.\u201d</p><p>Y/N resisted rolling her eyes at the Targaryen woman.</p><p>Before Davos could introduce her, Tyrion cleared his throat.</p><p>\u201cThis is Princess Y/N of House Baratheon, my Queen. Oldest and only pure blood child of the former King Robert Baratheon of the Seven Kingdoms.\u201d</p><p>Y/N could not hold her tongue.</p><p>\u201cI was Princess of House Baratheon and Lannister, your Grace. But I am no longer.\u201d</p><p>Daenerys was not sure how she felt about the woman before her. Deemed a princess but refused the title.</p><p>\u201cWhy so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor the Houses in which my lineage belonged have hands soaked in blood. Mostly for the wrong reasons. I choose not to be associated with such terrors.\u201d</p><p>Daenerys took in the woman\u2019s words. </p><p>She continued to speak of the former support of House Stark to the Targaryen seat of the throne. Apologising for the actions of her father and more. Offering Jon Snow the position of Warden of the North if he swore to bend the knee.</p><p>Whilst the Khaleesi spoke to the trio, images flashed in Y/N\u2019s mind. Segments of the dreams she had whilst Melisandre resurrected her those few months ago. \u00a0The voice. The language. The destruction. It was her. The Khaleesi.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. You\u2019re not guilty of your father\u2019s crime. And I\u2019m not beholden to my ancestor\u2019s vows.\u201d</p><p>Jon began to discuss with Daenerys about the dangers of the White Walkers and the threat the Night King held. Seeking help from the woman and her armies. </p><p>\u201cDid you see three dragons flying overhead when you arrived?</p><p>The torches of fire flew above them. Like in her dream. As the memories of her dreams began to take control of her attention, Y/N\u2019s eyes misted over. It was as though a mystic force was forcing her to view these images of what may be the future. Throughout the sounds of fire and screams, Y/N heard the faint sound of a bird. Calling in the distance. The sounds of a crown.</p><p>\u201cThe Army of the Dead is real. The White Walkers are real. The Knight King is real. I\u2019ve seen them. If they get past the wall and we\u2019re squabbling amongst ourselves \u2013\u201d</p><p>He began to walk closer to the throne.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re finished.\u201d</p><p>Turning away from the Khaleesi, he faced the Baratheon woman. Concerning taking over as he saw only the white of her eyes. Her Y/E/C completely gone. </p><p>Daenerys paused. Sensing the shift in atmosphere from the Northern man.</p><p>\u201cI was born at Dragonstone. Not that I can remember it.\u201d</p><p>Standing from the throne, Daenerys began to walk towards Jon, unaware of the cause of his concern.</p><p>\u201cWe fled before Robert\u2019s assassins could find us. Robert was your father\u2019s best friend, no? I wonder if your father knew his best friend sent assassins to murder a baby girl in her crib. Not that it matters now of course. I spent my life in foreign lands. So many men have tried to kill me. I don\u2019t remember all of their names. I have been sold like a brood mare. I have been chained and betrayed, raped and defiled. Do you know what kept me standing through all those years in exile? Faith. Not in any gods. Not in myths and legends. In myself. In Daenerys Targaryen. The world hadn\u2019t seen a dragon in centuries until my children were born. The Dothraki hadn\u2019t crossed the sea. Any sea.\u201d</p><p>She ceased her steps as she neared the man in question. </p><p>\u201cThey did for me. I was born to rule the Seven Kingdoms. And I will.\u201d</p><p>Jon swivelled to face the woman. </p><p>Daenerys face fell as the colour drained from Jon\u2019s. Following his gaze as everyone moved to stare at frozen stance of Y/N. Her face contorted in fear and anguish.</p><p>Y/N lip began to quiver as the sound of screams and fire became too much to handle. When all of the sudden, her breaths stopped. Her lips quivered no more. While Y/N eyes were still misty, her gaze was now transfixed on the Khaleesi. Her eyebrows furrowed, and terror was still apparent across her features. </p><p>Jon moved to stand closer to the woman, worried that she could collapse at any moment. </p><p>\u201cY/N?\u201d</p><p>Her gaze did not waver. With her eyes on the Khaleesi, and the sound of screams and fire dissipating in her mind, Y/N uttered a warning. High Valyrian leaving her tongue as though it was her mother language. The words sending a shiver of fear down the Khaleesi\u2019s spine.</p><p>\u201cAsh kessa ropagon toliot se s\u012bkuda D\u0101r\u0233ti. \u00a0Syt lo se suvion won\u2019t oss\u0113nagon \u012blva, perzys kessa.\u201d<br>(Ash will fall over the seven kingdoms. For if the ice won\u2019t kill us, fire will.)</p><p>Once the words left her mouth, Y/N breathed once more. The mist in her eyes slowly evaporated; coming back to her sense. </p><p>Shaking her head, Y/N looked around at the people in the room. Confused at why the Khaleesi and everyone else looked towards her in either worry or shock.</p><p>Locking her gaze on Jon, she grabbed his hand.</p><p>\u201cAre we done? Is it time to rest now because I have a large headache.\u201d</p><p>No one uttered any argument. Even the Khaleesi did not object, nodding to Tyrion as a sign that the conversations was over. For now.</p><p>\u201cMissandei, may you please show our guests to their chambers. We will continue talks on the matter shortly.\u201d</p><p>Tightening his hold on Y/N\u2019s hand, Jon could not tear his eyes away from his woman as they were escorted to their temporary chambers.</p><p>\u201cY/N?\u201d</p><p>Continuing to walk between Jon and Davos, Y/N turned her gaze to the Onion Knight.</p><p>\u201cYes, Davos?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you speak more than one language fluently?\u201d</p><p>Instantly the girl replied.</p><p>\u201cYes. I speak three.\u201d</p><p>The duo awaited her answer.</p><p>\u201cI speak our mother tongue, sarcasm, and Tormund.The man makes up his own words. You get used to them.\u201d</p><p>The two men looked towards one another. A silent conversation discussed between them. They would need to look into this matter further tomorrow. But as for then, they were all due a rest. For the weeks ahead in Dragonstone was to become some of the most active and challenging.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-During their stay in Dragonstone, Jon had convinced Daenerys to give her hand in support against the White Walkers. Gaining sufficient amounts of Dragon glass to help prepare the weaponry for the war. Since the meeting with Daenerys, Y/N\u2019s words were not discussed. However, the Dragon Queen kept a close eye on the Baratheon. Stunned at the woman\u2019s words and sudden eloquence of High Valyrian. For a woman who had denounced her title and lived amongst Wildlings, Daenerys could see she was powerful. And when Y/N interacted with the Queen\u2019s dragons for the first time, Daenerys could see how strong that power truly was.</p><p>Whilst Jon and Davos assisted with the mining of Dragon glass, Y/N had found much time on her hands. Becoming acquainted with her uncle once more, and even learning more about the ruling of the Khaleesi. She was clearly loved by many. Especially her dragons. </p><p>Y/N had not meant to wander as far as where the dragons were held. But she was bored. And with Jon out of the castle, there was not much she could do. Walking across the grounds she whistled to herself, shuffling her feet as she walked. All of a sudden, the harsh sounds of flapping wings could be heard. Y/N looked up to the sky, to see Drogon descend to the ground, Y/N quickly stepped back. Keeping a safe distance from the creature. He was the child of the Khaleesi, and Y/N felt that the Queen was still not particularly fond of her.</p><p>Once Drogon reached the ground, the dragon roared loudly into the sky. Y/N covered her ears at the screech; instantly beginning to panic. The Khaleesi probably was already on her way. Accusing her of harming her dragon. </p><p>\u201cNo. No. Please stop screeching. I am not going to hurt you. Look I am really small. I have no weapons. I\u2019ll even take off my furs if it makes you shut the fuck up.\u201d</p><p>In her panic ridden words, Y/N pulled of her cloak, and carefully placed it onto the ground. The dragon sensed the woman\u2019s panic; stopping his roars. Drogon\u2019s eyes pierced into Y/N. Watching her as she stood a mere few feet away from the creature; her arms held up in surrender.</p><p>Elsewhere in the castle, Jon had arrived at the throne room, discussing with Tyrion and Daenerys about the next step in the plan; capturing a white beyond the wall. The roar from Drogon had startled them all, causing the trio to rush to the location of the noise. Greywind, Missandei, and Davos all hot on their trails as they emerged from their own locations.</p><p>But when they arrived at the heart of the noise, no one could believe their eyes. For Y/N no longer stood far away from the dragon; fear and panic taking over her features. But she stood next to the dragon\u2019s enormous head, stroking the creature\u2019s snout in a soothing matter. Rhaegal and Viserion had arrived between the time it took for the group to arrive. Each at either side of Drogon. All staring at Y/N in the same content and soothed manner.</p><p>\u201cOne night, I hold on you<br>Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, you<br>Castamere, Castamere, Castamere, Castamere<br>A coat of gold, a coat of red<br>A lion still has claws<br>And mine are long and sharp, my Lord<br>As long and sharp as yours.\u201d</p><p>Daenerys slowly stepped forward. Y/N still blissfully unaware of the group.</p><p>\u201cWhat is she singing?\u201d</p><p>Tyrion came to stand by his Queen.</p><p>\u201cIt is the song of House Lannister, my Queen.\u201d</p><p>Y/N never let her eyes drift from the dragon\u2019s. Resting her own head on its snout as her hand travelled to stroke the dragon\u2019s neck. She felt a connection with the creature. </p><p>\u201cAnd so, I speak, and so I speak<br>A girl of House of the Dear.<br>And now I weep, and now I weep<br>For the friends who are no longer here.\u201d</p><p>Tyrion exhaled a deep breath.</p><p>\u201cThat my Queen\u2026 is not part of the song of House Lannister or Baratheon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Everyone\u2019s gaze locked on Y/N. Surprised that she had finally acknowledged their presence.</p><p>\u201cIt is part of me.\u201d</p><p>Jon held his breath at her words. Watching in sorrow as a tear not only fell from Y/N\u2019s eyes, but the three dragons as well. </p><p>Daenerys raged within. She was powerful indeed. If she had been able to connect with her children, moving them to tears, Daenerys would have to do all she can to keep the woman on her side. For even though Y/N did not wish for the seven kingdoms, Daenerys knew that she could still grasp it from the Targaryen\u2019s hands.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-<br>When the night drew in, Y/N and Jon travelled to their chambers. Aware that their days ahead would be filled with difficult decisions and extreme conditions. </p><p>Even though the pair had shared chambers throughout their travels, they still ceased to have consummated their relationship. Both feared what the physical action could change between them. They knew of their love for one another. They had died for each other and would do so again. And yet neither had uttered those words. But in a world, such as their own, change was inevitable. </p><p>Once the duo had entered their chamber, Y/N discarded of her furs once more, pulling of her boots and untucking her shirt. Jon could see that she was still emotional. It seemed her emotions from her moment with the dragons had not dissipated. </p><p>Jon would usually leave Y/N to unchanged for bed, changing in one of the large bathrooms down the hall. However, he could not seem to have it in him to leave her alone at this moment. </p><p>Y/N began to get more frustrate with herself as she tried and failed to unbuckle her sword. Jon watched as she quickly gave up the task, holding her head in her hands in frustration. She had not felt this overwhelmed since the moment Jon arrived in the Wildling\u2019s camp. Seeing her uncle again, the segments of dreams, her moment with the dragons, and the tension she felt from Daenerys, all became too much. Tears fell from her eyes and into her hands. </p><p>Jon\u2019s heart broke at the sight of Y/N crying. He had only seen her cry few times of the years they spent together. Most of which had been the last few years. He missed when times were easier, brighter, happier. When all he thought about was marrying her. He still thought about it. But this game had clouded his brain; stealing time that he could have had with her. He did not want any more time to be lost.</p><p>Walking across the room, Jon lowered to his knee in front of Y/N. Pulling her hands away from her face, Jon wiped away the tears that rolled down her cheeks. Slowly placing his lips onto her own, gently caressing his mouth across hers. He wanted her to know he was there. That he had always been there. Y/N reciprocated the gesture. Allowing her arms to travel to the man\u2019s hair, pulling his raven locks free from its confines. Enveloping her hands through the tresses. Jon could not help but moan at the feeling. Pulling back, he muttered the words that had always been there. But had never been said.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Y/N Baratheon. I loved you from the moment you arrived with your father for your annual visit when I was 12 years old. I loved you then and I love you now.\u201d</p><p>Jon waited for a reply. The room filled with silence. Y/N\u2019s hands still in his hair as she stared at the man in disbelief. Jon began to regret his decision when suddenly, Y/N began to giggle. The giggle soon turned into a boisterous laugh as a large smile overtook her face.</p><p>Jon looked on in hurt and confusion.</p><p>Seeing his confused state, Y/N pulled Jon\u2019s face down to her own, placing a chaste kiss onto his mouth. </p><p>\u201cI love you too, Jon Snow. There was a reason I did not want to marry Robb. I had another Stark in mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d</p><p>Y/N giggled, her right hand moving to hold Jon\u2019s neck. </p><p>\u201cNo, Sansa. Yes, you. It has always been you Jon.\u201d</p><p>To say he was elated would be an understatement. That moment, Jon knew however this game ended, if Y/N was by his side, he could withstand the most ruthless leaders and most horrendous torture, as long as she was alive.</p><p>With the confessions of their love, the moment elevated their relationship emotionally and physically. For that night Y/N and Jon became each other\u2019s half. Consummating their relationship\u2026 more than once. Deep down, they had always known that they held love for each other, but they both had to grow as people; as their own individuals. </p><p>The cherished moment seemed to have sparked a light in the pair. For after that night, they refused to leave each other\u2019s side. Words of love and encouragement shared in intimate moments. They still caused trouble for each other as much as they did when they were younger, but now all Y/N and Jon could feel was each other\u2019s love. And they would both do anything to keep the other safe.</p><p>The duo and Davos soon saw their group expand. Heading to Eastwatch-by-the-Sea to capture a White Walker, they had gathered Tormund, Jorah Mormont, Gendry, Sandor Clegane, Thoros, Beric Dondarrion, and a few others along the way. With the loss of Thoros, a few other men, as well as Viserion at the hand of the Night King. Jon and his group had travelled to Kings Landing, to ask for the assistance of Queen Cersei against the White Walkers. Y/N had refused to attend. Her mother and uncle Jaime still blissfully unaware of her livelihood. She could not face her mother, after everything she had done. Not yet.</p><p>Winterfell was their next adventure. Travelling by boat with the Khaleesi and her hands, Jon wrapped his arms around Y/N\u2019s waist. The same as he did all those months ago when they had voyaged to Dragonstone. She turned in his hold, running her hands over the man\u2019s shoulders. </p><p>\u201cAre you ready? Ready to be back in Winterfell. With your family. With me.\u201d she questioned her partner.</p><p>Jon looked down at the woman in his arms.</p><p>\u201cI have never been so ready for anything else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither have I.\u201d</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-Laying in the chambers that had once been his brothers, Jon turned to his side to see Y/N still fast asleep. Tired from the journey they had taken to Winterfell with the Khaleesi and her army. She had been feeling more tired in the past few weeks, blaming it on the numerous exertions beyond the wall, having to deal with Jon and Tormund every day, and her body still getting used to being alive once more.</p><p>Jon admired his beloved, wrapping his arm around the woman, pulling her to lay as near to him as possible. He watched as Greywind slowly move closer to the bed, placing his head on top of Y/N\u2019s stomach. Jon dismissed the action, not thinking anything of the creature\u2019s behaviour.</p><p>A smile overtook the man\u2019s face. Leaning down, he placed a chaste kiss on Y/N\u2019s forehead, smiling even wider when her own face broke out into a sleep filled smile. Still unconscious, Y/N reached out her hand in Jon\u2019s direction. Jon instantly tangling it with his own. Laying his head down to rest, Jon shut his eyes. They would both need sleep to prepare themselves for the inevitable war.</p><p>However, what both of the wild spirits failed to realise that they no longer had to keep each other safe, but also the life that was growing as they slept. Greywind nuzzled Y/N\u2019s stomach, hearing a small heart beat loud and clear.</p><p>For Jon may have thought to have been a bastard and Y/N a princess of House Baratheon and Lannister, but their child would be so much more. A child of the Houses Targaryen, Lannister, Baratheon, and Stark. A child of the Wildlings and rightful heir to the Iron Throne. A child of the North, South, East and West. A child that would create a new world. </p><p><br></p><p><b>A/N- Woah, three weeks of non-stop writing as well as exams. My next piece is either going to be Podrick or Sandor Clegane.

Turned out it sent my brain into hyper drive and this was the outcome. I did not expect it to be this long. But I have never felt so proud than I have writing this. SO, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mwv_vSZxPQeTauv5UpSpz7w\">@witch-of-letters</a> , I am sorry for the wait and I hope you all enjoy.</b></p><p><b><i>Word Count- 19,891 words. Yes that is correct.</i></b></p><p><b><i>Warnings- death, angst, murder, spoilers (bit late now), fluff, and everything in between.</i></b></p><hr><p>\u201cI bet you can\u2019t shoot an arrow through the middle of the target.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bet I can.\u201d</p><p>Y/N Baratheon was not a girl to be challenged. Especially by Jon Snow. Her closest and dearest friend from the North. </p><p>Ever since her father, King Robert Baratheon, and Ned Stark had formed an allegiance, Y/N had travelled with her father to Winterfell every month. Being the only true born Baratheon of her siblings, Y/N and her father was very close. Whilst Robert and Eddard Stark discussed important royal matters, Y/N and Jon were often causing trouble. From antagonising each other to cause mayhem, or choosing to do so on their own terms, the two together were a handful. With Robb added to the duo, the chaos greatly increased. For the trio showed no mercy with their mischief.</p><p>Robb smirked at the younger duo. Leaning against the pillar, he watched on as Y/N furiously grabbed her bow and arrows. </p><p>\u201cIf you shoot the arrow through the target, you can have my portion of shank at dinner tonight.\u201d</p><p>Jon knew she would never back down the chance to have more food. Even though the Baratheon\u2019s was one of the strongest families in all the kingdoms, the House of Stark produced the most glorious food in the kingdoms. Food that tasted like it was made with love and from the heart. </p><p>Squinting at the young bastard, Y/N nodded. </p><p>\u201cDeal. And if I miss?\u201d</p><p>Jon looked at Robb, a smirk forming on both of their faces.</p><p>\u201cYou have to wear a dress at dinner tonight. And we mean, a dress preserved for weddings and balls; not any sort of old tat.\u201d</p><p>Y/N glared towards Robb as he spoke the conditions. Looking back at Jon, she waited to hear his opinion. </p><p>The young man winked at the young woman, shrugging his shoulders as though he did not know what Robb was going to say. He did. They had agreed on her punishment earlier that morning.</p><p>The young Baratheon loathed dresses. Refusing to wear them, unless for extravagant events; much to her mothers\u2019 chagrin. She preferred to wear breeches and a tunic instead. They were more form fitting than that of a man\u2019s; for her mother only appeased with the clothing if it could be altered to uphold some femininity. </p><p>The boys waited with baited breathes for her response.</p><p>\u201cDeal.\u201d</p><p>Cheers rang from the pair. Y/N shook Jon\u2019s hand. Watching as the young bastard walked towards Robb, and away from the direction of the target. And any areas around it. They were all still learning to shoot, so It was no surprise that an arrow wold stray every now and then.</p><p>Taking a deep breath in, Y/N closed her eyes, slowing her breathing down. Opening her eyes, she raised her bow and arrow. Pulling the string back with necessary force, her vision zeroed in on the target. Moving her aim so that the arrow should fly straight through the centre. Taking one last inhale, she begins to release the string of the bow when-</p><p>\u201cY/N!\u201d</p><p>The shout of her name caused Y/N to flinch, the arrow flying through the air. Embedding itself into the target. Just to the right of the bullseye. </p><p>Y/N groaned, throwing the bow to the floor, she swivelled to the direction of the shout. Looking towards the balcony, Y/N stared at her father. </p><p>\u201cFather look what you did. You just cost me an extra shank you knob.\u201d</p><p>Many would have been shocked to have heard how the princess spoke to the king, but it was normal. The two Baratheon\u2019s were not the conventional pair.</p><p>King Robert chuckled heartily. With Eddard at his side, who raised an eyebrow in his son\u2019s direction. The two boys bowering the heads, to hide their laughter.</p><p>\u201cAll of you get ready for the banquet tonight. Robb come with me and your father. We have matters to discuss.\u201d</p><p>The three friends looked at each other in confusion. Robb shrugged his shoulders as he walked in the direction of your father and his. </p><p>\u201cI wonder what they need him for.\u201d</p><p>Y/N walked towards Jon. The pair watching as Robb and their fathers head into the castle.</p><p>\u201cWell, you better start getting ready. Who knows how long it\u2019ll take to get into your dress.\u201d</p><p>Jon laughed as Y/N turned towards him, stepping so close that their breathes mingled. Leaning impossible closer to his face, Y/N glared into Jon\u2019s eyes. </p><p>\u201cI may have missed the bullseye, but if that was a real man, it would have gone straight through his heart.\u201d</p><p>At the end of her words, Y/N moved back from their proximity and walked in the direction of her chambers. Jon staring at how her hips swayed as she aggressively walked further away. </p><p>Flittering his gaze between his chest and the target, he realised she was right. Shaking his head, Jon began his trek towards his own chambers. The only thought flittering through his mind was how he was one day going to marry Y/N Baratheon; bastard or not. He was going to make it a reality.</p>[[MORE]]<p><br></p><p>The banquet had begun 20 minutes before Y/N had arrived. Robb sitting next to his siblings and parents at the head of the hall. Even Theon was sat amongst the Starks. For once, Catelyn had allowed Jon to attend; to appease Y/N\u2019s begs of her friend being present. \u00a0Sitting away from all Baratheon\u2019s and Starks, Jon conversed with his uncle Benjen, speaking of matters that could affect his future greatly.</p><p>Jon had been awaiting Y/N\u2019s arrival. When she had walked through the door, he could not help but catch his breath. Neither could Robb, or any young man in close proximity. Whilst Jon could not tear his eyes away from Y/N, his uncle Benjen left Jon to ogle.</p><p>\u201cBloody hell. She should be bent over and ravished in that dress.\u201d</p><p>Robb elbowed Theon in his stomach. Causing the ward to lose his breath; coughing on the lack of it.</p><p>Y/N looked at the table at the head of the room. Seeing her plate next to her fathers and her mothers. Walking towards it, she reached where it laid. </p><p>At the sight of their daughter, her parents ceased their conversation. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re finally looking like a lady Y/N. What has caused this drastic change? Or should I ask whom?\u201d</p><p>Y/N rolled her eyes at her mother\u2019s words.</p><p>Going to grab her plate, she hiked up her skirt to climb up the platform to the table. </p><p>Piling more vegetables and mashed potatoes on her sparsely filled plate (most likely her mother\u2019s doing) she shoved her shank into her mouth, ripping off a large portion of the meat. With her plate in one hand, and her shank in the other, Y/N pointed at her father with the bone of meat. Amusement clear on his face. Whilst her mother and siblings held disgust. Laughter could be heard from the Stark children at her antics.</p><p>\u201cStupid bets with the stupid Stark boys. I would have had it if father had not called for me.\u201d</p><p>Robert bellowed with laughter at his daughter\u2019s frustration. </p><p>She turned to glare at him, however, she could not keep a smile from taking over.</p><p>\u201cBecause of that, I am going to sit with Jon. The poor bastard is probably bored out of his mind.\u201d</p><p>Cersei shook her head at her daughter\u2019s words.</p><p>\u201cYou will do no such thing.\u201d</p><p>Y/N bore her eyes into her mother\u2019s, taking another bite out of her shank.</p><p>Chewing the meat ever so slowly, she swallowed the chunk. Throwing the bone on her plate, she licked her fingers clean; angering her mother even more. </p><p>\u201cLet her mother, she\u2019s acting like a homeless harlot any way.\u201d</p><p>Whipping her head towards Joffrey, she took in his words. Looking her younger brother up and down with a glare that could kill, the young Lannister swallowed harshly.</p><p>Heading to walk past the Starks and down the steps of the platform, she kept her eyes on Joffrey, stopping to stand in front of the young Stark girls.</p><p>\u201cSansa cover your ears.\u201d</p><p>The girl did so.</p><p>Directing her words back to Joffrey, she smirked at her brother.</p><p>\u201cYou can call me a harlot. But at least I\u2019m not an incestuous little bitch.\u201d</p><p>Cersei\u2019s head whipped in her daughter\u2019s direction. Watching as she diverted her attention to the Starks.</p><p>Y/N smiled as Arya, Theon, and Robb chuckled at her words. Motioning for Sansa to uncover her ears, she knew the girl still heard. But she didn\u2019t care. </p><p>\u201cNow if you\u2019ll excuse me. I have fulfilled my duties and my part of the bet. So, I am going to sit with Jon and enjoy my meal.\u201d</p><p>As she continued her path across the platform, Y/N reached out her hand to quickly grab Theon\u2019s leftover shank.</p><p>The ward standing in his seat.</p><p>\u201cYou fucking bitch! I didn\u2019t finish that.\u201d</p><p>The girl trotted down the steps, walking through the array of people backwards. </p><p>Much like she had done to her father, Y/N used the shank to point at Theon.</p><p>\u201cNext time you talk about bending over a girl and ravishing her without consent, think about how you will go hungry for the rest of the night.\u201d</p><p>Turning to face Jon, she walked towards the man; who had witnessed and heard mostly everything. </p><p>Robb sitting next to Theon, laughed as the ward fell back into his seat in a sulk. </p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s right mate.\u201d</p><p>Theon scoffed.</p><p>\u201cAt least I won\u2019t be married to her and have her not love me back.\u201d</p><p>Robb stared at the Greyjoy.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean? She might learn to love me back.\u201d</p><p>Theon scoffed, continuing to eat the food left on his plate.</p><p>\u201cYou really think her, and Jon only see each other as friends. Why do you think her father and yours are marrying her to you? Jon\u2019s a bastard and not a Stark. If he were, they would be married by morning.\u201d</p><p>Robb shifted in his seat. He knew Y/N did not see him the same as he saw her. But for others to see the obvious tension between Jon and Y/N, and he hadn\u2019t, made it even more real for Robb. </p><p>Sitting back in his seat Robb looked forward.</p><p>\u201cRemember, you aren\u2019t a Stark either Greyjoy. So, stop pretending that you are.\u201d</p><p>Theon paused his eating at Robb\u2019s words. Rage bubbling deep inside as he began to drink his wine excessively. </p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-</p><p>Dropping her plate in front of Jon, Y/N raised her skirt to sit comfortably on the chair. Shovelling Theon\u2019s shank, unattractively, into her mouth. Using her sleeve as a makeshift napkin to wipe her face.</p><p>Jon could not help but watch in amusement. </p><p>Swallowing the food, Y/N looked into her friend\u2019s eyes. </p><p>\u201cHas Ned told you?\u201d</p><p>Taking a swig of his wine, he placed the cup down.</p><p>\u201cTold me what?\u201d</p><p>Wiping her mouth once more, Y/N reached over to grasp Jon\u2019s drink, gulping some down herself.</p><p>\u201cMy father and Ned have arranged for Robb and I to wed.\u201d</p><p>In disbelief, all Jon could do was stare at Y/N.</p><p>Putting his cup back on the table, Y/N leaned her head on her hand, watching herself play with her food.</p><p>\u201cThey haven\u2019t told me yet. Turns out Arya over heard them tell Robb. She came to me straight away. Telling me that Robb did not argue against it, the cunt.\u201d</p><p>Jon licked his lips. Running his hands over his face. Looking back at the young woman in front of him, Jon analysed her expression.</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re not happy with this?\u201d</p><p>Y/N rolled her eyes at his question. </p><p>Waving her hand in the air, she answered.</p><p>\u201cOf course, I am not happy Jon. Robb is like a brother to me. I don\u2019t view him in that way. And unlike some people in these kingdoms, I don\u2019t want to fuck my family. I want to marry whomever I choose.\u201d</p><p>Jon laughed at her words.</p><p>\u201cAnyway, what did Benjen want? You seemed to be having a pretty serious conversation.\u201d</p><p>It was Jon\u2019s turn to stare at his own plate.</p><p>\u201cHe came to inform me that he was travelling to join the Nightswatch. And I told him that I want to join too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>Jon raised his gaze to the girl, seeing her expression fall.</p><p>\u201cSo, Lord Stark, Sansa, and Arya will be travelling to Kingslanding back with your family. I will follow Benjen to the wall-\u201c</p><p>\u201cAnd I will be here, marrying Robb, and helping your mother tend to Bran, whilst Theon does God knows what.\u201d</p><p>All Jon did was nod his head. </p><p>\u201cWell we better make the most of today and tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Raising her shank, she laughed as Jon cheered it with his own. The pair continuing to laugh throughout the feast. </p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-As there last day together approached, Y/N and Jon never left each other\u2019s side. Causing more mischief than ever before. King Robert and Eddard chose not to interfere, knowing that it was going to be a while before they would see each other again. Robb had also left the pair alone, for Y/N would be his wife soon, and they would be together for a long time coming. </p><p>The day went too quickly for the pair, and as morning came, Y/N could not help but feel the tears gather in her eyes at the thought of being left by her father and Jon. </p><p>Watching as Arya and Sansa left with her family in tow. She stood next to the Stark sisters as the clambered onto their horses.</p><p>\u201cKeep Sansa safe Arya.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d The younger Stark replied.</p><p>\u201cAnd Sansa?\u201d</p><p>The older Stark looked towards Y/N.</p><p>The Baratheon smiled.</p><p>\u201cHelp yourself to all my dresses and fabric. I\u2019ve have never worn most of them.\u201d</p><p>Sansa smiled in appreciation.</p><p>Y/N\u2019s expression became more serious.</p><p>\u201cAnd please be careful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d</p><p>The pair went to begin their journey to Kingslanding. </p><p>Y/N turned to the guard next to her; already mounted on his steed.</p><p>\u201cPlease watch over them Sandor. You and I both know how evil of a cunt Joffrey is.\u201d</p><p>The Hound huffed at her words. Lifting the helmet, he placed it on his head.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do my best. Don\u2019t get yourself killed now little Doe.\u201d</p><p>Y/N laughed at his nickname for her, watching as her family and the Starks set of on their journey. </p><p>She had already said goodbye to her father in privacy. Not wanting to cry even more than she knew she would when she would have to say goodbye to Jon.</p><p>Once the carriage and horses were a mere speck in the horizon, she allowed herself to face Jon. Examining the exchange between him and Robb, she could feel her heart hurt at the sight. </p><p>Strolling towards them, Y/N witnessed as the Stark brother\u2019s let each other go. Quickly taking Robb\u2019s position as he left the pair to say their goodbye\u2019s.</p><p>Standing next to his steed, Jon watched as Y/N walked slowly towards him. Quickly gulping down the sobs in her throat, Y/N pulled Jon in too a tight embrace. Burying her head in the crook of his neck, the young pair stayed in that position for a long time, that \u2018just friends\u2019 would deem too long.</p><p>Jon was the first to pull away. Holding her face in his hands, Jon stroked her cheek with his thumb. Catching the tears that had escaped her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI promise that we will see each other soon. You can tell me all about the married life with my brother.\u201d</p><p>Y/N laughed. Clutching Jon\u2019s furs with her fists. She pulled him closer, their heads resting against the others. A solemn look falling on her face.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to marry Robb.\u201d</p><p>Jon let out a breath.</p><p>\u201cI know. I wish you wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>She replied.</p><p>\u201cSo, do I. I love him, but not in the way a man and wife love another.\u201d</p><p>Pulling her head back, Y/N\u2019s hand travelled to Jon\u2019s neck. Her surprisingly warm fingers sending tingles down the man\u2019s spine.</p><p>\u201cPromise we will see each other again.\u201d</p><p>Jon nodded his head. </p><p>\u201cI promise.\u201d</p><p>As he muttered his promise, Y/N leaned her face closer to his own. Placing her lips on his cheek, she slowly pulled them away. Detaching herself from the Stark bastard, Y/N sadly smiled at Jon.</p><p>\u201cYou better get going. By the time you get there, the snow would have melted.\u201d</p><p>Jon chuckled. Mounting his horse, he positioned himself comfortable on the saddle. </p><p>Benjen began to follow the Nightswatch as they started their journey out of the gates of Winterfell.</p><p>Y/N stepped back as Jon trotted his horse to catch up with his uncle. </p><p>\u201cJon!\u201d</p><p>Turning his head, he caught Y/N\u2019s gaze.</p><p>\u201cRemember. If you ever need to, aim to the right.\u201d</p><p>Jon felt a large smile take over his face.</p><p>\u201cStraight at the heart.\u201d</p><p>Y/N smiled in return.</p><p>\u201cStraight at the heart.\u201d</p><p>Much like her father leaving, Y/N stood in her place. Refusing to move until Jon was a speck in the distance.</p><p>As she stood, watching Jon leave, Robb slowly approached. Standing to the side of the Baratheon princess. </p><p>The pair stood in silence. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Robb looked towards his soon to be wife.</p><p>\u201cWhat for?\u201d</p><p>She let a few tears fall.</p><p>\u201cI love him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you too.\u201d</p><p>Robb turned his gaze back to the gates. The two watching as the guards shut them closed.</p><p>\u201cBut not in the same way.\u201d</p><p>Y/N shook her head.</p><p>Placing a hand on Robb\u2019s shoulder, their eyes connected.</p><p>\u201cNo. But I will be the best wife I can be.\u201d</p><p>Robb smiled at her words. He had no doubt she wouldn\u2019t.</p><p>Squeezing his shoulder, Y/N let her hand drop, walking away from Robb and away from the gates where she had said goodbye to her family and Jon. Walking into the castle that she now would call home. But nowhere would be home without her father. And nowhere would make her feel as happy as when she was with Jon.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-As the months passed, it became easier for Y/N to become more comfortable in her permanent residence at Winterfell. Coming to terms of her life with Robb. He was her friend, and he needed her help. Robb accepted the fact that she did not love him the same, but he knew she still cared for him deeply. And when word had come to Winterfell that King Robert Baratheon had sadly passed, Robb\u2019s shoulder was there for Y/N to cry on. Y/N had reciprocated the compassion when news of Ned\u2019s execution hit Winterfell. She hated Joffrey and her mother with a passion.</p><p>The young Baratheon was distraught. Being the closest to her father out of her siblings, she felt as though she had lost the only true family member she had. Heartbroken that she was not at his side when he sadly passed. Her tears of sorrow were soon replaced with tears of dread when she realised what would occur if anyone was to find out the true bloodline of her siblings. She had known for years of Cersei and Jaime\u2019s relationship. How nobody else had realised why she looked so contrasting to her siblings, Y/N prayed for the day that the truth would be revealed to never come.</p><p>However, it did, and as Joffrey sat on the Iron Throne, word had travelled around the kingdoms. Causing the War of the Five Kings to begin. With Joffrey, her uncle Stannis and Renly, Balon Greyjoy, and Robb, all fighting for the throne.</p><p>As the war surged forward, Y/N noticed that Robb\u2019s attention had been caught by one of the young healers; Talisa. Watching the pair converse, Y/N smiled to herself. She was happy that he had finally found true love. And at that moment of thought, Jon entered her mind. She wondered where he was now. If he ever thought of her on his travels. If he was safe, or even still alive. </p><p>On a seemingly quiet night, Catelyn approached Y/N in the drawing room. As she pulled the girl into her embrace, she informed her of the nuptials that would occur that evening.<br>\u201cFor Robb and I?\u201d</p><p>Catelyn shook her head, a smile taking over her features.</p><p>\u201cNo. For Talisa and Robb.\u201d</p><p>Y/N let out the breath she held. Robb was her \u201cbrother\u201d, and he was finally going to get married. To someone who loved him back.</p><p>\u201cThank high heavens. No disrespect Catelyn. I love your son. But not in that way.\u201d</p><p>The Stark woman laughed at the Baratheon\u2019s exclamation; enveloping her in another hug.</p><p>\u201cI know you mean no harm in your words. It\u2019s not your fault that your heart belongs to Ned\u2019s bastard.\u201d</p><p>Y/N shook her head, pulling herself out of the woman\u2019s grasp.</p><p>\u201cGive the boy some slack Catelyn. He\u2019s out there defending the wall for us.\u201d</p><p>Catelyn dismissed the girl\u2019s words with a wave of her hand.</p><p>\u201cNow let\u2019s get you in something more suitable for a wedding. No more breeches for the rest of the day.\u201d</p><p>Y/N followed begrudgingly as Catelyn helped her get ready for Robb\u2019s wedding. </p><p>Walking across the field, Y/N sauntered into Robb\u2019s tent, watching as he finished getting ready.</p><p>\u201cWell somebody looks like a king.\u201d</p><p>Robb chuckled, turning to his friend. </p><p>\u201cAnd somebody looks like a princess.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI am one, you dickhead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t dress like one.\u201d</p><p>Y/N punched Robb\u2019s shoulder at his words.</p><p>Robb laughed.</p><p>\u201cCome one. Let\u2019s go get you married. This is going to be the best wedding in all the kingdoms.\u201d</p><p>For soon after the ceremony occurred, blood flooded the floors of the room. Waldor Frey\u2019s men killing everyone and anything. With Greywind at her side, and a bow in her hand, Y/N fought off many of the soldiers. Trying her best to protect Robb. </p><p>Out of nowhere, one of Frey\u2019s soldiers jumped from behind, swinging his dagger in Y/N\u2019s direction. Just as Y/N thought this would be her end, Greywind attacked the soldier\u2019s arm, causing the sword to slice Y/N\u2019s face; narrowly missing her eye. She was alive. She could deal with a cut face as long she was alive. Pulling her arrow back, she landed it perfectly into the heart of the solider; Greywind keeping him down with his grip on the man\u2019s arm.</p><p>\u201cY/N!\u201d</p><p>At the shout of her name, she turned to Robb. </p><p>\u201cGet out of here. Take Greywind with you.\u201d</p><p>Y/N shook her head.</p><p>\u201cI am not leaving you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you are. Go find Jon at the wall. I am not going to lose both Talisa and you. Mother and I will be okay. Go.\u201d</p><p>Y/N looked at Catelyn\u2019s direction.</p><p>\u201cGo.\u201d The women whispered.</p><p>AS Catelyn held the knife to the throat of Frey\u2019s wife, Y/N slipped out the room. Quickly mounting one of the horses, with Greywind at her side, and her bow on her back, she fled from the wedding and from Winterfell.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-She could feel in her bones the guilt of leaving Robb and his mother behind. Of not being able to help Talisa. Of not being able to do something more. The guilt and grief only grew more when on her way to the wall, as she stopped to eat in a small tavern, Y/N over-heard of the gruesome events that occurred after she left. Hearing men laugh as they spoke about how Waldor Frey\u2019s soldiers cut off Robb\u2019s head and paraded his body around. How Catelyn\u2019s throat was slit open. How Talisa was murdered, and so was her and Robb\u2019s unborn child.</p><p>She could not hear no more. Continuing to travel as she arrived closer and closer to the wall. Collecting weapons, furs, and food along her travels. Greywind never leaving her side. Y/N remembered the directions to the Nightswatch, having spoken to her father and Eddard about it in great deal; when she was younger. She was always fascinated by the stories of the wall, so it was no surprise that she would want to know more about the men who would be guarding it. </p><p>Y/N had been travelling for weeks when she finally arrived at the wall. Searching for a secluded space, she hopped off of her horse. Stroking the animal\u2019s mane, Y/N grabbed out the necessary food from her satchel. Feeding both the horse and Greywind before devouring an apple herself. She could not risk lighting a fire and cooking. It could draw unwanted attention. But what she didn\u2019t know was that she had already done so by being there. As she was finishing her apple, out of nowhere, Greywind began to snarl. Instantly dropping the core of her fruit, Y/N reached for her bow and arrows; standing in front of the horse with Geywind at her side. </p><p>Looking towards the area where Greywind gazed, she saw fur and lots of it, approaching where she stood at the wall. The figures moved closer and closer. Wildlings. Y/N had no time to run or hide. With the direwolf and horse by her side, she would not be able to escape quietly. Drawing her bow, Y/N made sure her weapons were secure on her body. She was not going to be killed by Wildlings. Not when she had survived this long.</p><p>As they approached, one by one, the Wildlings noticed the woman in front of them. She was dressed very similar to them. The only differences being that her furs were a mixture of red and black. Tormund stood near the front of the group with Ygritte by his side. So, it came as a very big surprise when they reached the wall to enter the watch, that a woman stood in front of it. With a bow in her hand and a huge fucking wolf snarling towards them. </p><p>Y/N pulled her bow to aim at the ginger Wildlings\u2019 chest.</p><p>\u201cTake another fucking step and I will shoot this arrow straight through your heart, Wildling.\u201d</p><p>Tormund let out a boisterous laugh at her words.</p><p>\u201cWill you kill me little fox? Will you kill us all? You don\u2019t know who you are messing with.\u201d</p><p>Without missing a beat, Y/N answered.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Tormund continued to laugh.</p><p>\u201cBut he will help me.\u201d</p><p>AT the sound of her words, Greywind began to growl louder, his body arching as he slowly strode closer to the Wildlings. </p><p>Tormund quickly became quiet. </p><p>\u201cNow if you don\u2019t let me go, I will paint this wall red with your blood and use your skulls as bowls to feed my direwolf. You hear?\u201d</p><p>Silence encompassed them. </p><p>\u201cI like her.\u201d</p><p>Y/N shifted her arrow to the ginger woman at her words.</p><p>Tormund\u2019s shocked expression moving to gaze at her as well. </p><p>Ygritte simply shrugged her shoulders. </p><p>\u201cShe has fire. You of all people should know how strong a person kissed by fire is.\u201d</p><p>The Wildling\u2019s murmured amongst each other, looking at Tormund to respond.</p><p>Tormund looked at Ygritte. The ginger girl giving a quick nod of her head. Their silent conversation coming to an agreement.</p><p>Turning back to the Baratheon, Tormund sheathed his dagger. Taking another step closer; to only take it back as the direwolf growled once more.</p><p>\u201cOkay little fox. We do no harm.\u201d</p><p>Y/N never let her eyes leave the group. Keeping herself on edge for any attack.</p><p>\u201cHere me out little fox.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo not call me fox. I am not a fox.\u201d</p><p>Tormund could see Ygritte smirk in the corner of his eye. Yes. She would fit right in. </p><p>\u201cIf you have no place to stay, come with us Wildlings. You will be safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need your help. I am safer alone.\u201d</p><p>Ygritte rolled her eyes at the girl\u2019s words. She felt that way once too.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t be safe when the Whites arrive.\u201d</p><p>Y/N shook her head. Not wanting to believe her words. She had heard stories, but it has been hundreds of years since White Walkers roamed around Westeroes. But her mind suddenly reeled back to all the warnings Eddard Stark had given before his death. Winter is Coming. That is what he meant.</p><p>Slowly lowering her bow, she kept the object in a type grip at her side. Clicking her tongue, she signalled for Greywind to heel at her feet. The direwolf still on high alert.</p><p>\u201cIf I was to come with you, you swear an oath to do me no harm.\u201d</p><p>Tormund laughed once more. As did many of the other Wildlings.</p><p>\u201cAn oath? Were Wildlings. You\u2019re lucky to even be offered shelter.\u201d</p><p>Y/N continued to stare at the man, her eyes flickering to Ygritte\u2019s, as the woman\u2019s expression remained serious.</p><p>\u201cWe swear.\u201d</p><p>At Ygritte\u2019s words, the Wildlings bellowed disagreements. </p><p>Y/N, taking Ygritte\u2019s word, began to lead her direwolf and horse towards the Wildlings. She trusted Ygritte. She even felt compelled to trust the big ginger one, but she still kept her eye out for any dirty bastard who would break their word.</p><p>\u201cFine. We will amuse this oath. But if you are to stay with us, you will live the Wildling way. They call me Tormund Giantsbane.\u201d</p><p>As they began to head towards the Wildling\u2019s keep, Y/N walked between Tormund and Ygritte. The rest of the Wildlings in front of them. Greywind stayed close behind Y/N for protection, as she led her horse by its reigns.</p><p>\u201cWhy Giantsbane?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI killed a giant when I was 10. Then I climbed right into bed with his wife. When she woke up, she suckled me at her teat for three months. Thought I was her baby. That\u2019s how I got so strong: giant\u2019s milk.\u201d</p><p>Y/N could not help but smile at the man\u2019s story. Confusing Tormund as many of whom he had told the story to would either look deathly afraid, repelled, or even turned on. Not amused like Y/N was.</p><p>\u201cNow what do they call you little fox.\u201d</p><p>Y/N thought whether or not to reveal her true identity. To be trusting or to be safe. She chose the latter.</p><p>\u201cThey call me Doe.\u201d</p><p>Tormund looked at the woman in confusion.</p><p>\u201cDoe? A deer?\u201d</p><p>Ygritte laughed at Tormund\u2019s expression.</p><p>\u201cA female deer.\u201d</p><p>Tormund glared at his Wildling friend.</p><p>\u201cI know what a doe is, you fucker.\u201d</p><p>Ygritte smirked.</p><p>\u201cIt sounded like you didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>As the two bickered back and forth, walking either side of the Baratheon, Y/N could not help but reminisce of the funny quarrels between her, Robb, and Jon. She missed them both dearly. Whilst she may never be able to reunite with Robb, she knew she was so close to seeing Jon. She could feel it.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-Turns out, Y/N\u2019s feelings were correct. For the bastard of Eddard Stark was a lot closer than she thought. She had been living with the Wildlings for nearly a year when Ygritte had travelled back from her duties at the wall. \u00a0But Ygritte wasn\u2019t alone. It seemed she had turned the tables on her capture; catching the crow herself. </p><p>As Ygritte travelled back to the Wildling den with the crow, Y/N and Tormund sat at the fire. The man watching as the woman hacked and carved the elks they and other Wildlings had caught earlier that day. She had come to take position of cook the minute she arrived. Being near the fire reminded her of life back home. She had also taken up cooking whilst living with Robb; wanting to become friendly with the servants and hand maidens that she thought would be with her for life. But how she was wrong. </p><p>During her months with the Wildlings, her skills in sword fighting had become a lot stronger. Adhering the techniques of the Wildlings, the Starks, and those her uncle Jaime had taught her, made Y/N\u2019s fighting style unique. Untouchable. Her skills with an arrow had no match to anyone else either. She was a strong warrior. One the Wildlings had come to admire.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve grown strong Little Doe. Nearly as strong as I.\u201d</p><p>Y/N smiled at Tormund\u2019s words. The man reminded her of her father. His contagious laugh and rosy cheeks were similar to that of the Baratheon king. Cutting the elk into pieces, Y/N placed them onto the fire. </p><p>\u201cAnd I did not need one drop of giant\u2019s milk.\u201d</p><p>Tormund bellowed with laughter at the girl\u2019s sarcasm. She was still a spitfire. That aspect had not changed.</p><p>Y/N had come to adapt to the Wildling lifestyle very quickly. Most of it not being that different to her adventures with Jon and Robb. Hunting, sparring, and amongst other training activities. She was more comfortable here than she had ever been under the gaze of her mother. No dresses in sight. Just thick furs and weapons. Jon would have fit right in, she thought. </p><p>Wiping her hands on her trousers, Y/N stood up, handing some already cooked food to Tormund. The man began to devour the food instantly. </p><p>\u201cI am going to give the rest of this food out to the ones who have yet to eat. So, don\u2019t think about eating my plate or else the last words out of your mouth would have been about how strong I am. Got it Tor?\u201d</p><p>The man held up a thumb, shoving the rest of his forkful into his mouth. He had learnt that the young woman did not kid when it meant food was involved.</p><p>Picking up the large box of prepared food, Y/N trudged out the camp and headed towards the groups of Wildlings she had left to feed. The women and children smiled at her arrival. The men nodding their heads in respect. She began to hand out the meals; blissfully unaware of Ygritte and many other Wildlings entering the camp with Jon Snow at their side. </p><p>\u201cHey Dongo?\u201d</p><p>The giant stopped hammering the pole at the sound of his name. He smiled once he saw it was Little Doe. Even the giants had come to care for the Baratheon. Everyone treated her as though she was a born and raised Wildling.</p><p>As Y/N\u2019s attention was aimed at feeding the giant, she failed to see the crow, behind the large beast, being ushered into the main tent. Grabbing a large slab of shank out of her box, she handed the meat to the giant. </p><p>\u201cIf you want anymore, Xera is also cooking in the tent over there. You\u2019ve worked really hard today.\u201d</p><p>The giant nodded in appreciation, watching as Y/N carried on weaving through the groups of Wildlings to feed the hungry.</p><p>\u201cI smell a crow.\u201d</p><p>Tormund had ceased eating once he felt the presence of a stranger in the tent. Ygritte stood to one side of Jon, as the Lord of Bones stood at the other. The man pulling of his mask as he spoke.</p><p>\u201cWe killed his friends. Thought you\u2019d want to question this one.\u201d</p><p>Tormund kept his back to the trio.</p><p>\u201cWhat do we want with a baby crow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis baby killed Qhorin Halfhand. He wants to be one of us.\u201d</p><p>At Ygritte\u2019s words, Tormund stood from his seat; staring at Jon.</p><p>\u201cThat half-handed cunt killed friends of mine. Friends twice your size.\u201d</p><p>Jon took deep breaths. Trying to not show his fear.</p><p>\u201cMy father told me big men fall just as quick as little ones if you put a sword through their hearts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlenty of little men tried to put their swords through my heart. And there\u2019s plenty of little skeletons buried in the woods. What\u2019s your name, boy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJon Snow.\u201d</p><p>Tormund\u2019s face changed to one of confusion. Having remembered a time when the Little Doe had mentioned a man named Jon. No last name. But it had been one of the few times she had talked so openly of her past. Of a boy she had grown besides, who had to leave to protect the place he lived.</p><p>Jon kneeled before Tormund, mistaking him for Mance Rayder, the King-beyond-the-Wall.</p><p>\u201cYour Grace.\u201d</p><p>The wildlings laughed, Tormund ignoring his thoughts.</p><p>\u201cYour Grace? Did you hear that? From now on, you\u2019d better kneel every time I fart.\u201d</p><p>With the Wildlings laughing, Mance Rayder appeared from the shadows, heading towards the crow.</p><p>\u201cStand, boy. We don\u2019t kneel for anyone beyond the Wall.\u201d</p><p>Jon raised to his feet, watching the man before him.</p><p>\u201cSo, you\u2019re Ned Stark\u2019s bastard. Thank you for the gift, Lord of Bones. You can leave us.\u201d</p><p>The lord of Bones left, Ygritte soon following in tow. As she exited the tent, Y/N approached the woman, food already in hand. </p><p>\u201cHere you go Ygritte. Just heard you had arrived back. With company as well. Who\u2019s the poor soul this time?\u201d</p><p>Ygritte smirked at the girl\u2019s words. Much like Tormund, the girl had spoken of a Jon. But had given no name. However, with the details she had told, Ygritte knew the man in the tent was the man Y/N had spoken about. Not wanting to give anything away, Ygritte took the food from the woman. </p><p>\u201cYou know, just some crow. We killed the rest. Thought this one could be useful, He\u2019s in there with Mance and Tormund. Head in if you like.\u201d</p><p>At the end of her words, Ygritte walked away, watching from her peripheral vision as Y/N began to walk into the tent.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014As she stood outside the tent, Y/N could hear Mance Rayder and Tormund tormenting the poor crow.</p><p>\u201cThe girl likes you. You like her back, Snow? That why you want to join us?\u201d</p><p>As she quietly stepped into the tent, Y/N body became rigid at the sight of dark black curls. It couldn\u2019t be.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t panic, boy. This isn\u2019t the damned Night\u2019s Watch where we make you swear off girls.\u201d</p><p>Tormund came to stand at the entrance, his face turning to see Y/N frozen in the doorway. Concern taking over his features.</p><p>\u201cThis chicken eater you thought was king is Tormund Giantsbane.\u201d</p><p>Jon refused to turn to look at the man; only until he saw Mance Rayder\u2019s expression change as well. </p><p>The leader of the Wildling\u2019s had also seen Y/N stand in the door. Both men worried at her reaction to the sight of the crow.</p><p>\u201cLittle Doe is there something wrong?\u201d</p><p>At the sound of the name, Jon\u2019s head whipped to the direction of the door. Only one person other than Sansa that he knew was called Little Doe.</p><p>For the first time in two years, Y/N and Jon was in each other\u2019s presence. Through loss, deceit, fear, they had gone through it all and were back together again. </p><p>\u201cY/N?\u201d</p><p>Tears sprung to her eyes at the sound of her name. She never thought she would the sound of her name so much. But she missed the man that spoke them more. </p><p>\u201cJon.\u201d</p><p>As she cried his name, the man strode towards the woman. Jon pulling her body flushed against his own. Clinging to each other with all their strength. Pulling the other tighter and tighter. Afraid to be ripped apart once more.</p><p>Pulling back just enough to look into his eyes, Y/N spoke to Jon for the first time in a long while.</p><p>\u201cI came to the wall after what had happened, and I stopped to rest. But then Tormund and the Wildlings came; warned me about the dangers beyond the wall. I\u2019ve been here since. I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t save Robb and Catelyn. I\u2019m so sorry Jon.\u201d</p><p>The girl cried. The sound broke the hearts of all three men. None of the Wildlings had ever seen or heard the woman cry. They weren\u2019t aware of the terrors she had fled when they had found her. </p><p>Jon wiped away the tears. His hand cupping Y/N\u2019s face, as the other continued to hold her waist; keeping her body close. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not your fault. You are a Baratheon, not a Lannister. You did not kill them.\u201d</p><p>The young woman hiccuped.</p><p>\u201cBut I didn\u2019t save them either. I should have tried harder.\u201d</p><p>Jon held her closer, trying to sooth the woman in his arms. </p><p>\u201cBaratheon?\u201d</p><p>Y/N ceased her sobbing at the sound of Tormund\u2019s voice. </p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d</p><p>Lifting her head from Jon\u2019s chest, she kept a firm grip of the man\u2019s furs, as she turned her head to where Tormund stood next to Mance Rayder. Tormund continuing to look confused, whilst Rayder\u2019s showed no expression. </p><p>Y/N sits down with the men and begins to explain to them her story. Of how she was meant to marry Robb Stark, the events of the Red Wedding, of all the hatred she held towards her mother and siblings. </p><p>\u201cI have felt more at home here and at Winterfell than I ever did in Kingslanding. The only reason I was still there was because I am the only pure born Baratheon and I was not going to leave my father. If you wish for me to leave, I will do so. But I never intended to harm you. In anyway, and I am sorry that I lied to you both, and the others.\u201d</p><p>Mance Rayder looked at Tormund, the man staring back. Their silent conversation being recognised by Jon as he came to sit next to Y/N. His body gravitating to sit as close as he possibly could. </p><p>The two men nodded towards the other. Looking back at the girl. </p><p>Mance Rayder spoke clearly to the woman.</p><p>\u201cYou have shown through your words and actions that you are no Lannister. That you are no coward. That you are a Wildling. Through and through. The only way you could be more Wildling is if Tormund had birthed you himself.\u201d</p><p>Y/N chuckled at his words.</p><p>\u201cThat is true.\u201d Tormund agreed.</p><p>\u201cYou are one of us. That will never change.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you Rayder.\u201d</p><p>The man smiled at the young woman. Taking that as his leave, he stood from his seat and walked towards the entrance. </p><p>\u201cSnow.\u201d</p><p>Jon looked at the man standing at the door.</p><p>\u201cWe shall discuss matters of you being here at a later time.\u201d</p><p>At the end of his words, Mance Rayder left the room, leaving the trio alone.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still our Little Doe. Still unstoppable with a bow and arrow and a fucking great cook.\u201d</p><p>Jon smiled at Tormund\u2019s words to Y/N. He was proud that she had been able to survive so long in the game that was being played. Away from most of the carnage, but still aware of the fight. That she had been able to gain respect from a group that many people in Westeros never dared to fight against.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Tormund. You are still my fire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye. You better tell that to your friend.\u201d</p><p>Tormund left the pair alone in the tent. His laughter becoming quieter and quieter the further he travelled away.</p><p>Turning to face Y/N, Jon threaded his fingers through her hair. Wanting to feel her presence as much as he could. Cupping his hands with her own, Y/N leant into his touch. Glad to feel the familiar touch of the man before her. </p><p>\u201cSo, tell me about the Watch? Have you finally made some friends, besides me and your family?\u201d</p><p>Jon chortled at her words. Y/N had always teased Jon about his lack of companions when they were growing up. As Robb and Theon grew older, they had many friends and even some women at their sides. Whereas it seemed Jon was content with only having her.</p><p>\u201cA young man called Samwell Tarly. He has become a great companion of mine. But all men of the Watch are brothers in arms. We have each other\u2019s backs.\u201d</p><p>A sullen look took over Y/N\u2019s features as she pulled her face away from Jon\u2019s caress. Worry instantly took over Jon at the sudden change in her demeanour.</p><p>\u201cAnd what would they make of you here with us Wildlings?\u201d</p><p>Jon huffed out a breath; unsure how to answer. </p><p>\u201cBut you are not a Wildling.\u201d</p><p>Y/N took great offense to her friend\u2019s statement.</p><p>\u201cYou heard Mance Rayder. I am a Wildling. Through and through. The only way I could be more Wildling is if Tormund had birthed me himself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cY/N, you are a Princess of House Baratheon and Lannister. You are meant to be in a castle, safe and away from all of this.\u201d</p><p>Y/N was hurt. Jon of all people should know how much she hated her life in Kingslanding.</p><p>\u201cYou know that I have never wished to be a princess. You know that one of the reasons I travelled with father to Winterfell so often was because the horrible torment I would have faced when he had gone.\u201d</p><p>Y/N rose to her feet, as her anger began to take over her emotions. Jon regretting his words as soon as he said them. Y/N\u2019s hands slammed on the table between them. </p><p>\u201cYou know that the place I felt safest was at Winterfell and that all went when Theon betrayed your brother. When your brother betrayed his vow. When my grandfather betrayed me. Sending men to kill us all. Your brother may have died. But I had to watch one of my best friends die at the hands of my uncle. I had to run as I knew that Cateyln, the only honest and caring woman in my life, be killed. Whilst you were in Castle Black. Having no idea of the atrocities I faced.\u201d</p><p>Y/N wiped her nose, as tears pricked her eyes once more. Looking away at the man in front of her. His saddened expression making her wish she wasn\u2019t so harsh. But she could not allow him to disrespect all she had been through.<br>\u201cThese people took me in. They could have left me to die, whilst I searched for you, but they didn\u2019t. They helped me grow as a warrior. If Ygritte and Tormund did not take me in, I would most likely be on the other side of that wall, with eyes as blue as the summer sky, and skin as cold as the ice.\u201d</p><p>Jon flinched at her words, at the idea of her being part of the dead beyond the wall. Standing from his seat, Jon strode around the table, moving to stand in front of Y/N, forcing the woman to look at him.</p><p>\u201cI am sorry. They were your family as much as they were mine. I cannot imagine the feelings you have felt. But I am here now, and I am going to make sure that you are safe.\u201d</p><p>Looking into his eyes, Y/N searched to see any lies. She loved Jon. More than she cared to admit, but they were a part of a game much bigger than the both of them, and that meant having to question the actions of those they loved. </p><p>Stepping closer, toe to toe, Jon could feel Y/N\u2019s breath on his face. His eyes momentarily closing at the feeling. </p><p>\u201cWill I be safe in Castle Black? Among the Nightswatch? Because I don\u2019t think I will.</p><p>Y/N left the room, allowing her words to linger in Jon\u2019s heart. His chest feeling heavy at the thought of Y/N feeling unsafe with him. But he knew it wasn\u2019t his presence that made her feel unsafe, but that of the Nightswatch. For as far as they, and everyone else in Westeros knew, Princess Y/N Baratheon was dead. And she was. For this new woman, sitting next to Wun Wun in the open camp, was not the same Baratheon that Jon had left in Winterfell. But Jon\u2019s heart still thumped as hard.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-</p><p>A few days after Jon\u2019s arrival at the camp, Mance Rayder ordered for Tormund to escort a group of Wildlings to attack Castle Black from the rear. Instructing Tormund to have Jon accompany him.</p><p>Tormund and the Wildlings had prepared to leave camp, when out of nowhere, Y/N appeared at Tormund\u2019s side. Cloaked and ready for the journey ahead. </p><p>\u201cYou are not coming Little Doe.\u201d</p><p>Y/N stared straight ahead, ignoring Tormund\u2019s words. </p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s right Y/N.\u201d</p><p>Jon slightly flinched at the glare she through his way.</p><p>\u201cI am still pissed off at you Snow. So, don\u2019t tell me that I would be safe at Castle Black, then tell me I cannot come with you. Because you will be proving yourself to be a liar.\u201d</p><p>Turning her head back forward, Y/N began to march forward with the Wildlings. Jon was frozen in his place. Staring as the woman walked at the front of the group, unafraid of what was out there. Turning his head, Jon realised that Tormund had ceased moving, much like Y/N, glaring at the man in question. Jon gulped. </p><p>\u201cYou better start walking crow. You\u2019ve already pissed off one Wildling today. Don\u2019t make it another.\u201d</p><p>Jon instantly began to walk, he and Tormund quickly catching up the group; situating themselves at the front once more.</p><p>It did not take long for things to go South. With Ygritte and Jon\u2019s near-death experience climbing the wall, to Jon refusing to kill the innocent man, Y/N had to step in. She may have been angry with Jon. But she was not going to watch him be killed.</p><p>\u201cTormund! Stop! You are not going to kill him.\u201d</p><p>As Y/N runs to aid Jon, Ygritte grabs her arms from behind; restraining the young woman.</p><p>\u201cYgritte if you were my friend, you would let me go.\u201d</p><p>Ygritte held on to Y/N\u2019s arms tighter.</p><p>\u201cI am not going to let you go because you are my friend, and you will make the wrong decision.\u201d</p><p>Out of nowhere, Summer and Shaggydog arrive at Jon\u2019s side. Greywind had been kept absent from the expedition due to the treacherous climbing and walking. They could not carry supplies for twenty plus Wildlings and a direwolf.</p><p>As Jon was fighting successfully against the Wildlings, with the help of the direwolves, Y/N fought excessively hard to get out of Ygritte\u2019s grip. Successfully doing so and grabbing her bow and arrow as well. Holding the arrow in the direction of Tormund and Ygritte, Y/N stepped closer towards Jon.</p><p>\u201cYou are not going to kill him!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a traitor. Still loyal to the Nightswatch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s my family and so are you. I am not losing anymore family\u2026\u201d</p><p>As Y/N held back the Wildlings, with Summer at her side, Jon successfully killed Orrell. Suddenly, an eagle swooped down to attack the man, clawing him across the face. Y/N turned at the commotion, running towards Jon, she whistled, causing a horse to approach. Placing her bow onto her back she pulled out her sword, swinging it back and forth to keep away the eagle and any approaching Wildlings.</p><p>\u201cGet on the horse now!\u201d</p><p>Jon slowly climbs onto the horse. He holds out his hand for Y/N to take. Looking sadly at the man, she ignored his hand.</p><p>\u201cOne day Jon Snow, we will see each other again.\u201d</p><p>Clapping the horse on the back leg, Y/N urged the stead to gallop away from the Wildlings. Jon watching as she was quickly restrained once more by the people she had called family. She had put herself in danger to save him. Jon would never forgive himself.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>Y/N\u2019s arms were bound tightly together. Gagged to stop her screams as Tormund ordered for Ygritte and other Wildlings to chase after Jon. \u00a0She fought and fought to free herself, but she could not fight no longer. Tormund carrying Y/N himself to their base to rest. Facing forward, he dared not to look down at the woman in his arms, hearing her soft broken cries caused his heart to replace the anger he felt at her actions to change to sadness at the sound of her tearful woes.</p><p><br>Jon cleaned his facial wounds in a small pool. His horse grazing nearby. He heard the sound of a bow being drawn, turning to see Ygritte, an arrow notched and aimed at him. Anger surges through her at the betrayal of the man. His betrayal to the Wildlings. To Y/N. Her friends.</p><p>\u201cYgritte, you know I didn\u2019t have a choice. \u00a0She always knew what I was. What I am. I have to go home now. I know you won\u2019t hurt me. Y/N wouldn\u2019t want you to hurt me.\u201d</p><p>Ygritte\u2019s hold on the bow began to loosen.</p><p>\u201cYou know nothing, Jon Snow. You know nothing of what you and her family have put her through.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do know some things. I know I love her.\u201d</p><p>Ygritte grunted, drawing her bow harder in rage.</p><p>\u201cI have loved her since we were children. I loved her when her father told her she was meant to marry my brother. I loved her when I left for the Watch. And I love her now. Through all she has been through. I love who she was and who she has become.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why did you betray her. Why did you betray us?\u201d</p><p>Jon paused with his words. Staring deep into Ygritte\u2019s eyes, seeing the blinding rage that she held towards him.</p><p>\u201cI have to make things right. To make it better for her.\u201d</p><p>Ygritte fought back tears at the thought of Jon taking away her friend. But also, for the fact he was leaving her once more. \u00a0Jon turned around, unaware, as Ygritte loosened an arrow into his shoulder. Jon fell to the ground, grunting in pain. \u00a0Notching another arrow, Ygritte watched as Jon lurched up and grabbed onto his horse. She hesitated. Not wanting to hurt him more than she had. He was right. Y/N would not want her to do this. But she had to.</p><p>Jon mounted his steed as Ygritte shot an arrow into his leg; crying out as he spurred on his horse. With her anger rising once more, Ygritte shot her third and final arrow, lodging it into the crow\u2019s back. If he were a target, it would be right on the bullseye. Cursing as she let the man gallop away.</p><p>When Ygritte arrived back to camp, her quiver empty, but no Jon in sight, Y/N wasn\u2019t sure if she had successfully killed the man and left him to other creatures beyond the wall, or if she had let him go. </p><p>Y/N sat next to Tormund, arms still secured behind her back. Her face void of any emotion. Ygritte went to walk past the woman but halted as words left the princess\u2019 mouth.</p><p>\u201cDid you kill him? If you were my friend, you could at least tell me that.\u201d</p><p>Ygritte looked at her friend, bound and sat on the floor. Like a slave. Like a prisoner. Nothing like one of their own. She hated to see her like this. But they had to be careful.</p><p>\u201cI did what I had to do.\u201d</p><p>Ygritte walked away from the woman, ignoring as her hunched shoulders went slack. Y/N no longer had the will to fight. Jon had betrayed her, the Wildlings had betrayed her, and she had betrayed them as well.</p><p>Y/N was kept detained for the time that the Wildlings prepared to invade the Black. Even though she had fought against them, Tormund and the Wildlings still cared for her. Becoming increasingly worried as she refused to speak and eat. All day and all night, she sat shackled, watching them prepare with a blank stare. Tormund could not deal with it no more. </p><p>Moving to sit next to the distant woman, Tormund dropped to the ground with a loud thud. Bringing a canter to her lips, he forced her to swallow.</p><p>\u201cYou are not dying because of that traitor, Little Doe. I understand why you did what you did. We forgive you.\u201d</p><p>Y/N shook her head at his words.</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t. I protected him. I haven\u2019t seen him for years, but the moment he goes against him, I was by his side. I turned against you when I should have stopped him.\u201d</p><p>Tormund drank from the canter, staring into the distant hills. The air was cold, but not as harsh as it had been before.</p><p>\u201cBut we do forgive you. People do all kinds of things for love.\u201d</p><p>Y/N scoffed.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t love him. Not anymore.\u201d</p><p>Tormund couldn\u2019t help but smile at the woman\u2019s malice filled words.</p><p>\u201cYes, you do Little Doe. You love him, and he loves you. Through all the changes and things that have done you wrong, you love each other. Between you, there is fire, scorching hot fire. It cannot be put out. But it can be made stronger.\u201d</p><p>Y/N processed Tormund\u2019s words. </p><p>Tormund left the woman to think. She knew of the raids that had occurred in the towns. Having been kept behind and guarded by a group of Wildlings as they had occurred. She knew that the siege of Castle Black was to occur that night. She had to prove to her Wildling family that she could be trusted. That she has always been and will be a Wildling.</p><p>Rolling onto her back, Y/N pushed herself forward, flipping onto her feet. Bending her knees to get used to the feeling of standing once more, Y/N casually strolled through the Wildlings and towards Mance Rayder and Tormund and they spoke with numerous wildlings about the battle that was about to commence.</p><p>Slowing to stand beside Tormund, she listens to the conversation. Hearing the plan of action, Y/N nods her head.</p><p>\u201cOkay, if someone can untie me, I\u2019ll grab my weapons and get prepared.\u201d<br>Tormund jumped at the new presence, unaware of the woman at his side.</p><p>\u201cYou are not coming.\u201d</p><p>Y/N turned her gaze to Mance, the man\u2019s steely eyes piercing her own.</p><p>Determined, Y/N easily pulled her hands free from her restraints. </p><p>Tormund looked between her hands and the girls face.</p><p>\u201cYou could have freed yourself? You could have escaped.\u201d</p><p>Y/N kept her gaze on Mance Rayder.</p><p>\u201cBut I didn\u2019t because I had to pay for what I did. I still do. Let me kill those bastards who changed the man I knew. The Jon I knew would never have lied of his word. He is probably dead now anyway. I will have to come to terms with that. So, Mance Rayder, please allow me to fight. To fight for the Wildlings.\u201d</p><p>Y/N knew he was alive. She knew Ygritte had not successfully killed him. The woman had overheard her words to Tormund. Her shots were calculated to hurt no kill. But Y/N had to, for once in her life, fight for family.</p><p>The man stayed quiet, the Wildlings around them waited for his reply, Ygritte, who was amongst the crowd, watched in anticipation. </p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Y/N\u2019s determined look fell.</p><p>\u201cYou will not fight for the Wildlings. You will fight with the Wildlings. With your family.\u201d</p><p>A cheer broke out amongst the camp. Y/N beamed with a smile. She was not going to disappoint them again. Not this time.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-</p><p>In Castle Black, Jon and his men prepared for the battle. Jon hoped that Y/N would not be there. That she would not fight. But he knew, that if the Wildlings had forgiven her, that he would see her right at Tormund\u2019s side. The battle could see the end of them both before they had even begun. <br>A horn was blown. The crows stood their stance, ready to fight. But then another horn was blown, and Jon knew, that she was there, ready to fight as well. </p><p>Swords were swung, and arrows were flown. Blood from both sides was spilled and bodies of brave men and Wildling women fell. Jon was right, Y/N never left Tormund\u2019s side, hacking and slashing all Nightsmen that came in their way. Taking a hit here and there, she entered the castle with Tormund, infiltrating from the inside.</p><p>Jon had just killed Styr when Ygritte had caught his attention. Her bow and arrow aimed at the Northern man. She slowly began to lower her bow.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s inside with Tormund. Get to her.\u201d</p><p>Jon nodded, going to thank Ygritte, when he felt the arrow fly past. Watching as it embedded into Ygritte\u2019s chest. He ran to her, clutching her body as her breaths became shallow.</p><p>\u201cJon Snow. Look after her. You love her, and she loves you.\u201d</p><p>Jon clutched Ygritte. He had made a friend in the sarcastic Wildling and he knew Y/N loved the woman as a sister.</p><p>\u201cNo Ygritte, she needs us both. She needs you.\u201d</p><p>Ygritte struggled for one last breath.</p><p>\u201cYou know nothing Jon Snow. She needs you more.\u201d</p><p>As the words left Ygritte\u2019s lips, her body went limp in Jon\u2019s arms. The man watched as Olly continued to fight. The bow still in his hands. Jon quickly carried Ygritte\u2019s body to a safe space, covering her up. Taking a breath, he turned to the castle, heading in the direction he had briefly seen Tormund run.</p><p>Tormund and Y/N were back to back, fighting off the guards that crowded them. They had heard the cheers of the Nights watch. But they were not giving up. Y/ was not giving up. Tormund had two arrows embedded into his back, and Y/N\u2019s left arm had taken a deep cut from one of the swords. Another scar to add to the rest. It was two Wildlings against many more crows.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s over. Let it end.\u201d</p><p>The pair looked to see Jon, deflated and broken. </p><p>\u201cThis is how a man ends.\u201d</p><p>As Tormund raised his sword, clashing it with one of the men of the Watch, Y/N\u2019s eyes widened in shock as she saw Jon reach for the cross bow. Aiming for Tormund\u2019s leg, Jon released the arrow. The arrow hit where Jon aimed. However, it was not embedded in Tormund\u2019s leg, but in Y/N\u2019s left leg. </p><p>Jon looks on, masking in horror, walking to kick Tormund to the ground. </p><p>Y/N\u2019s own legs collapsed from underneath her. The pain and exhaustion taking over.</p><p>\u201cPut him in chains, we will question him later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou hurt her any fucking more than you have, I will slice your throat boy.\u201d</p><p>Two crows did as Jon instructed. Tormund screaming as they dragged him away.</p><p>Jon turned to leave.</p><p>\u201cWhat about the girl?\u201d</p><p>Y/N glared at Jon. Her breaths heavy and long.</p><p>He could not risk her any harm. If he gave her leverage, then they could both be harmed.</p><p>\u201cPatch her up and take her to the cells.\u201d</p><p>Before they could grab a hold of her, Y/N pulled the arrow from her leg, throwing the object to the ground </p><p>She stood, allowing the soldiers to pull her hands behind her back.</p><p>\u201cLock me away, but I a not having your filthy feathered hands touch me. I would rather bleed out. You\u2019ve changed Jon Snow. This game. This war. It changed all of us. Some for good and some for bad.\u201d</p><p>Jon gulped down the tears. Hurt from her words. </p><p>\u201cI SHOULD HAVE DIED WITH THEM. BUT HE SENT ME TO FIND YOU. TO BE SAFE. AND LOOK WHAT FINDING YOU DID TO ME!</p><p>Jon knew she referred to his brother and Catelyn. Even though she was being locked away, she still kept her identity a secret; knowing it would harm his position. He would have been killed for hurting her. Hurting the Baratheon princess. But she would have rather died a Wildling than lived longer as a noble.</p><p>The crows held her tighter, escorting her the same way that Tormund had been led.</p><p>Jon did not move until he could see her no more. Only then did he leave for his chambers. Preparing for the next step. Though she hated him, he was doing this all for her. He hoped that it would work.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-</p><p>Whilst laying in their cells, Tormund and Y/N had been made aware of Ygritte\u2019s death. Screams and cries were heard from Tormund for days on end; for his fallen family. When men walked past Y/N\u2019s cell, they heard silence. Only Tormund heard the quiet cries at night. His own tears erupting once more. Crying for Ygritte and for the pain they both felt. She apologised over and over, and Tormund reassured her over and over again. It was not her fault. </p><p>Jon was soon named the 998th Lord Commander. The wildlings below unaware of their leader\u2019s death and to position Jon was going to take of asking for their help. During their time\u2019s in the cells, Y/N had become dormant. Hardly eating, sleeping, talking, or doing anything at all. Detached from all that was surrounding her. </p><p>When Jon came to free Tormund and herself, to help travel and save the remaining Wildlings. Jon had unsuccessfully tried to speak to Y/N; the girl simply ignoring him as she had everyone else. They were all worried for her health. </p><p>\u201cShe is too ill to travel.\u201d</p><p>Tormund glanced at the woman in the cell, debating Jon\u2019s words.</p><p>\u201cIf she has to stay in this hell hole, at least get that large friend of yours to help her health.\u201d</p><p>Jon nodded his head. </p><p>Walking to Y/N\u2019s cell, Jon crouched at the gates. The woman stared blankly at the floor. She seemed lifeless, but the expanding of her chest proved otherwise.</p><p>\u201cI know I have changed. We both have. But I am doing this all for you. So, you can have the life you deserve. Away from all this shit that has happened. You cannot die. You did not die then, and you won\u2019t now. So, for once, you are staying here, and you are going to accept help. Samwell we come down to get you better and keep you company. I wish I could home you in proper chambers, but they would kill you if I did. We will be back soon.\u201d</p><p>Y/N slowly lifted her head as Jon spoke. Taking in his words. The two stared at each other in silence. Her eyes flickered to Tormund\u2019s figure.</p><p>\u201cKeep him safe Torm. Keep yourself safe too.\u201d</p><p>Tormund smiled, glad to hear his Little Doe speak again. He had missed her voice. </p><p>\u201cAye,I am a Giantsbane. We will be all right. Ain\u2019t that right boy?\u201d</p><p>Jon nodded, still holding his gaze on Y/N. Even as they left the dungeons, the man never wavered his look from her. He saw her lie on the floor as they left. Falling to sleep.</p><p>Jon informed Samwell of his commands, making sure that he kept it private between the two. He did not want anyone else to question why she was having assistance. Samwell took the orders with no hesitation or question. Instantly going into action, the minute that Jon and the other Wildlings left.</p><p>Everyday Sam would force Y/N to eat and drink. Checking her wounds, bringing her fresh furs and even cleaning her own. Doing all he could to make sure she became healthy again. For a while, it was only Sam talking to fill up the silence. He spoke of his life before the watch, to his opinions on pointless things, to information of the houses. Y/N hid her amusement when he recited the history of House Baratheon to the woman. Still unaware of who she was. To him, she was a Wildling with hardly a clue of the history of the houses. Of what had occurred within the kingdoms. Or so she thought. Samwell was a smart man. Smarter than he looked.</p><p>\u201cJon told me stories of when King Robert and Princess Y/N Baratheon would visit Winterfell. Of how close he was to the princess.\u201d</p><p>Y/N\u2019s ears perked up at Sam\u2019s words. Clearing her throat, she spoke to the young man for the first time.</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of stories?\u201d</p><p>To say Sam was shocked was an understatement. </p><p>\u201cWell, he spoke of how they met and all the trouble they caused with his brother, Robb. Of how devastated he was when he heard that King Robert and Eddard Stark had agreed for her to marry his brother. How it confirmed his reasoning of joining the watch.\u201d</p><p>Y/N pulled the thin blanket around her tighter. Her frame had become similar to how it was before, but she still did not fit her furs as she did before. </p><p>\u201cIf the betrothal had not been agreed then he would have stayed in Winterfell?\u201d</p><p>Sam nodded.</p><p>\u201cPrecisely.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThat bastard. He left because of Robb and I. He knew I never loved him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew it.\u201d</p><p>Y/N froze at Sam\u2019s explanation. All this time she had been able to hide who she was, and this oaf had reeled it out of her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the princess.\u201d</p><p>Y/N drank from the cup at her side. Placing it back down, she leaned her head on the concrete wall, turning to look at Sam, who sat on the other side of the bars. On a stool, holding his own drink.</p><p>\u201cWell, you going to kill me? Sell me for ransom and bribery?\u201d</p><p>Sam shook his head in a comical manner. The girl quirked an eyebrow. From the time he had spent tending to her, she had come to realise that Samwell\u2019s actions were pure. But she could not help but pull up her guard.</p><p>\u201cI wold never. I had my suspicions when Jon asked me to tend to you that you meant something to him. But it was not until you began to eat once more, and your face began to fill out, that I recognised your features. You look very different to your siblings yet so much like your mother and father. You have her beauty and his dark hair and eyes.\u201d</p><p>It had been a long time since Y/N had heard of her father or had been compared to him. She ignored the comments of her siblings and Cersei. But to hear that someone could recognise her as her father\u2019s child made her smile once more. <br>\u201cJon asked me to look after you. And that I will. I will do anything to make Princess Y/N Baratheon better once more.\u201d</p><p>Sam\u2019s words brought tears to Y/N\u2019s eyes. Not of sadness or pain like she had cried for the times that have passed. But tears of gratitude. She felt for the first time, in a long time, happy to hear her name. To hear her father\u2019s house and her name together. Even through all she had fought, Y/N truly believed her father would have been proud.</p><p>By the time that Jon, Tormund and many of the Wildlings had returned, Y/N was better and nearly stronger than ever. Sam had successfully convinced to be placed on full time guard duty of the Wildling woman. Helping her repair and get better. Sam confided in Y/N of his desires to become a maester. The woman encouraged him to do so, reminding him to not forget about Gilly and the child he has come to love as his own.</p><p>Sam travelled to library, where Jon sat, waiting for the news of Y/N\u2019s condition.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s better. She eats well, sleeps well, talks quite a lot.\u201d</p><p>Jon let out a small chuckle. Remembering of all the times she talked his ears off growing up.</p><p>Sam relied all of her improvements. Before mentioning his desires to leave. To become a maester. Remembering both Gilly and Y/N\u2019s encouraging words.</p><p>Jon stared at Sam, saying nothing.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be more use to you as a Maester. More use to everyone now that Maester Aemon\u2019s gone. The Citadel has the world\u2019s greatest library. I\u2019ll learn about history, strategy, healing. And other things. Things that will help when they come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf Gilly stays here then she\u2019ll die. And the baby that she named after me will die. And I\u2019ll end up dying, too, trying to protect them. Which means that the last thing that I\u2019ll see in this world will be the look in her eyes when I fail them. (pause) I\u2019d rather see a thousand White Walkers than see that.\u201d</p><p>Jon inhaled and exhaled. Nodding somberly, allowing Sam to go.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>The men continued to discuss Sam\u2019s relationship with Gilly and what it would mean for him to become a maester.</p><p>They sit in silence for a moment.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll come back. You\u2019re not my only friend anymore. I have you and Princess Y/N to visit.\u201d</p><p>Jon\u2019s head whipped up at Sam\u2019s words. </p><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d</p><p>Sam smiled faintly. </p><p>\u201cAll the times you spoke of her, `and how you were so adamant of a particular Wildlings safety rang bells in my mind. Then when she was getting better, she looked more Baratheon every day. I asked, and she replied. Told me all that had happened since she was reported dead. Well, since your brother passed.\u201d</p><p>Jon looked towards the doors. Pondering on whether to leave to see her. He had been wanting to since he arrived. No doubt Tormund had already re-laid all that had happened, to her.</p><p>\u201cGo. She may act like she does not want to see you. But she does. She spoke the most when your name was brought up in conversation.\u201d</p><p>Jon stood from his seat, bringing his friend into a hug. </p><p>\u201cTo you return.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo my return.\u201d</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-<br>Jon travelled to the cells where Y/N still stayed. Without an explanation, he unlocked the door. If the rest of the Wildlings were roaming around Castle Black, so should she. </p><p>Startled at the sudden noise, Y/N sat up from her position on the ground. Watching with baited breath as Jon yanked open the metal bars. Her time in the cells, and with Samwell, had left her hours to think long and hard about how she felt. How she felt about the game. How she felt about friends. How she felt about Jon. And how she felt about herself. She did not want to become a bitter woman. Y/N knew that Jon was doing what he thought was right. He always had. The man may have caused her pain and sorrow. But he was her best friend. He was her Jon.</p><p>Jon bent down to sit near Y/N, leaning his back against the wall, he left space between them. Trying to show that he did not want to over step any boundaries. </p><p>Without a word, Y/N scooted closer to Jon, so that their arms touched. Neither moved their gazes from the wall in front of them. Slowly, Y/N laid her head on his shoulder. </p><p>The pair sat there in silence for a long period of time. Basking in the shared company. It had been the first time in years that Jon and Y/N had been able to sit together, without talking about what had happened to them or what was going to happen next.</p><p>Ever so gently, Jon placed his right hand over Y/N\u2019s left. Interlocking their fingers, he stroked the back of the woman\u2019s hand. Basking in the small pieces of affection. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re back.\u201d</p><p>Jon smiled at her words. He was not sure if Sam\u2019s words were true. If she still cared for him.</p><p>\u201cSo am I. You can wonder freely around the castle now. You can share my chambers, if you would like. I know you don\u2019t feel relatively safe amongst the other men of the Watch.\u201d</p><p>Y/N pondered his invitation. Snuggling closer to Jon, she tightened her hold on his hand.</p><p>\u201cYeah. I would appreciate that a lot Jon. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would do anything to keep you safe.\u201d</p><p>Y/N tilted her head to stare into Jon\u2019s own eyes. Entranced by the other, their bodies moved closer together. Y/N laying practically on top of Jon.</p><p>\u201cAnd so, would I.\u201d</p><p>They stayed in the cells for the rest of the night. Enjoying the silence and each other\u2019s company. Cuddled in an embrace, Y/N and Jon fell asleep, wrapped around each other.</p><p>What they had been unaware of was little Olly slowly creeping down the cellar during their moment. Seeing his Lord Commander spread across the Wildling woman made the lads blood boil. He had lost his family, his village, his home, all to those foul monsters. And now the watch had lost their leader. A traitor. That is what Jon Snow was.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-And a traitor\u2019s death Jon was given. Sitting in his chambers, Y/N had left mere minutes earlier to speak to Tormund about increasing her training once more, now that she had been healed better. Jon\u2019s face was still flushed from the surprising kiss on the cheek from the woman. The unexpected affection causing the colour to travel across his face. </p><p>It soon disappeared when Olly quickly knocked on his chamber door, breathlessly explaining to Jon how Y/N had fallen down the steps when rushing to find Tormund. How she had heard a crack and could not move her right leg. Jon quickly left his chambers, following Olly who told him that Thorne was with the woman, who had refused any help unless Jon was there.</p><p>But what Jon had arrived to was not Y/N on the ground in pain with Thorne at her side. But Y/N held captive by Thorne; surrounded by members of the watch. The woman was gagged and shackled. The same she had been when the Wildlings lost the Battle of Castle Black.</p><p>Jon sees the woman crying. Turning to ask Thorne what the meaning of this all was, before Jon\u2019s words could leave his mouth, Thorne plunged a knife into his stomach. Y/N\u2019s screams ringing loud, even with the gag in her mouth. </p><p>With a hand on his stomach, Jon quickly manouvered to reach the woman. The loss of blood causing him to stumble. Just before he could reach her, Yarwyck, Marsh and two other black brothers proceed to stab Jon. Each dedicating their action \u2018For the Watch.\u2019 Jon dropped to his knees, swaying as he watched Y/n thrash against the men who held her captive. Her gag falling loose.</p><p>\u201cStop. Stop it now!\u201d</p><p>Thorne moved to stand behind Y/N, his dagger held tightly to her throat. When she gulped, she could feel the blade digging into her neck. </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t hurt her. She did nothing wrong.\u201d</p><p>Thorne sneered at Jon.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a Wildling. Everything she does is wrong.\u201d</p><p>Blood soaked Jon\u2019s armour. </p><p>\u201cShe is Princess Y/N Baratheon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am a Wildling. Born and bred.\u201d</p><p>Jon looked into Y/N\u2019s eyes. Tears falling from both his and her own.</p><p>If he was going to die, she was not going to let him save her. She was not going to allow the title she despised to kill the man she loved and save her life.</p><p>And as Olly laid down the final blow, stabbing Jon in the heart, the last thing he saw was was Thorne, a man he had come to respect and follow, slice the blade across Y/N\u2019s neck. </p><p>Their bodies falling to the ground simultaneously. Neither breathing. Neither alive. The blood poring out their bodies, and down the small dips in the snow, connecting the two puddles together. Even in death, Y/N and Jon were connected.</p><p>With a sign above Jon\u2019s head, labelling him a traitor, and a sign above Y/N\u2019s labelling her a savage. The men of the watch dismembered, leaving the bodies to be found in the morning.</p><p>And as the pair lay dead, Greywind and Ghost howled to the air, alerting Davos, Edd and his men about the bodies that laid in the snow. The group quickly bringing them into their quarters, with Greywind and Ghost protecting the door. </p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have the numbers.\u201d</p><p>Edd looked at Davos in contemplation.</p><p>\u201cWe have two direwolves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not enough. I didn\u2019t know Lord Commander Snow for long, but I have to believe he wouldn\u2019t have wanted his friends to die for nothing. Speaking for Princess Y/N Baratheon, those men have killed an heir to the throne. Our Lord Commander\u2019s partner. Our friend in arms. She will not die for nothing.\u201c</p><p>\u201cIf you were planning to see tomorrow, you picked the wrong room. We all die today. I say we do our best to take Thorne with us when we go.\u201d</p><p>Davos began to feel frustrated at Edd\u2019s words.</p><p>\u201cWe need to fight, but we don\u2019t need to die. Not if we have help.\u201d</p><p>The men in the room murmured amongst them.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s gonna help us?\u201d questioned one of the Nightswatch. </p><p>Davos looked across the faces in the room.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not the only ones who owe your lives to Jon Snow. Once they find out one of their own has been killed, they will come fighting and swinging. For Y/N may have been a princess, but she has a wilder family that lay closer to her heart.\u201d</p><p>Realisation swept over Edd. He turned to the Night\u2019s Watchman at his side.</p><p>\u201cBolt the door. Don\u2019t let anyone in. I\u2019ll be back as soon as I can.\u201d</p><p>Edd exited the room. The man swiftly and quietly left the room, heading down the halls and out the castle to the man who could help them. For now, they needed the help of the Wildlings.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-Ash. All she could see was ash covering the grounds of Kingslanding. Of her home. The sound of screams and burning fire growing louder by the second. As the screams become louder, her vision started to blur. With the Red Keep in the distance falling to the ground; fire encompassing the building. Just before the darkness took over, Y/N heard a single word, over the screams and the terrifying sound of burning. As clear as day, a single word; Dracarys.</p><p>Y/N gasped as her eye\u2019s shot open. Taking in the cold and chilly air around her, it quickly came to Y/N\u2019s attention how exposed she was. Feeling a nudging of her hand, Y/N turned her head to see Greywind at the side of the pillar in which she laid. A blanket held softly between his teeth. </p><p>Slowly sitting up, Y/N took the blanket from the direwolf, wrapping it around herself securely. Her body felt extremely cold; like a corpse. How could she be alive? Jon\u2019s men stabbed her. Looking down to her stomach, Y/N could see the angry red scars of where her stab wounds were. The last thing she remembered, before her dream, was Olly killing Jon. </p><p>Jon? Was he alive or dead? Y/N had no idea. As she began to panic, air leaving her lungs at a rapid pace, the door of the room creaked open. Twisting her head to look at the figure, she watched as Tormund stood in the doorway in shock. </p><p>\u201cTormund.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLittle Doe!\u201d</p><p>The man rushed into the room. Coming to help Y/N as she weakly stood from the pillar. Engulfing his arms around the small woman, she went to hug him back. Until she remembered her exposed state.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m kind of naked Tormund, so I cannot really reciprocate.\u201d</p><p>Tormund squeezed the Baratheon princess harder before letting go.</p><p>\u201cIt is only skin Little Doe. You are as naked as the day you were born. You should feel powerful.\u201d</p><p>The woman laughed.</p><p>\u201cI feel as though I was stabbed multiple times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because you were.\u201d</p><p>At the sound of the new voice, Y/N watched as Melisandre entered through the doors. The dark red head gracefully walked through the doors and travelled to stand next to Tormund. </p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s the witch that brought you and Jon back. I always say those kissed by fire had special powers.\u201d</p><p>Tormund laughed at his own words. </p><p>Y/N could not help the shock in her body. She had died and been brought back to life. But so, had Jon.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Jon? I want to see Jon.\u201d</p><p>Tormund ceased his laughter at Y/N\u2019s desperate pleas. </p><p>\u201cI will get him for you.\u201d</p><p>Tormund gave the woman another comforting hug. </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry Little Doe. He\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>Releasing Y/N, Tormund headed to the door. Leaving the two women in the room alone. </p><p>Y/N felt the red witches gaze on her body. Pulling the blanket tighter around her, she felt Greywind move closer; sensing his owner\u2019s discomfort.</p><p>\u201cYou hold great power.\u201d</p><p>Y/N looked towards the woman. Confusion written across her expression. </p><p>Melisandre stepped closer to the Baratheon.</p><p>\u201cPower so pure that mystic creatures will fall at your feet in awe. That even the darkest of heart will not be able to hurt.\u201d</p><p>The pair stared at each other in silence until the door opened once more. This time it was Jon who would walk through. </p><p>\u201cY/N.\u201d</p><p>Hearing her name from his mouth brought tears to her eyes. The images of seeing him stabbed by the men of the watch tumbled through her mind.</p><p>\u201cJon.\u201d</p><p>She sobbed as the man rushed through the doorway and encircled his arms around her body. </p><p>As Jon held Y/N, Melisandre exited the room. Her words hanging heavily in Y/N\u2019s soul. She could not think of them now. Because Jon was alive. They were both alive. </p><p>Y/N rose her arms, to encircle them around Jon, when she suddenly realised again, she was exposed. </p><p>\u201cJon, I would love to reciprocate this hug, but I am naked.\u201d</p><p>The man instantly let go. A blush covering his entire face and neck. He turned to see a set of clothes on the chair closest to the door. Quickly grabbing them, he handed them to the woman. Turning, once again, to face away as she began to dress.</p><p>Once she was fully dressed, Y/N walked towards the Stark bastard, wrapping her arms around his torso. Spinning in her hold, placed his arms onto her waist.</p><p>\u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d</p><p>The girl winced at his question.</p><p>\u201cSore. Tired. Probably the same as you. How long have you been alive again for?\u201d</p><p>Jon looked at the ceiling, thinking of all that had happened since he had awoken. </p><p>\u201cA while. We thought you weren\u2019t going to awaken. I\u2019ve dealt with Olly and the men who did this to us.\u201d</p><p>Y/N nodded her head, silently glad she was not present for the execution. </p><p>\u201cAnd I have handed over Castle Black to Edd.\u201d</p><p>Now that surprised her. </p><p>Looking up at the man, she could not formulate words. </p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause the Watch is not my home. We are going to take back Winterfell. Take back our home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou, I, and Sansa.\u201d</p><p>Y/N placed her arms on Jon\u2019s shoulders, staring her friend in the eyes. </p><p>\u201cSansa\u2019s here?\u201d</p><p>Jon grabbed onto Y/N\u2019s hand, guiding her through the halls ever so slowly. The woman still getting used to the feeling of being alive once more. Her headache slowly dissipating and her legs becoming sturdier. Turning around the corner, Jon opened a door to a dining hall. The room full of many unfamiliar faces eating, and a few familiar ones.</p><p>Jon lead Y/N to the table which seated Sansa, Tormund, Edd, Brienne, and Podrick. All of their heads turning to the commotion of the pair entering the room. Murmurs becoming louder as many men of the watch saw Y/N alive. Much like their Lord Commander, brought back from the dead for a reason.</p><p>Sansa stood from her seat at the site of the Baratheon princess. All of them being informed of what had happened to her and Jon. For the more days had passed, the more they thought she would not return.</p><p>Letting go of Jon\u2019s hand, Y/N embraced the young Stark woman; glad to see she had survived her tormented family.</p><p>\u201cI am sorry for what that cunt Joffrey did to your father; and to you.\u201d</p><p>Sansa grasped Y/N tighter.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I survived. And the moment was splendid. But I had to leave as quickly as I could. Joffrey has been the smallest of my troubles thus far.\u201d</p><p>Sansa pulled Y/N to sit down, with Jon moving to sit at her other side. </p><p>Y/N looked in front of her to the unfamiliar pair. However, one was more unfamiliar than the other.</p><p>\u201cPodrick Payne?\u201d</p><p>Startled, Podrick looked to the young woman. </p><p>\u201cYes, m\u2019lady?\u201d</p><p>Y/N let out a cheerful laugh.</p><p>\u201cMy god. You\u2019re alive. And you\u2019re no longer attached to my uncle\u2019s side. What happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was trailed for treason m\u2019lady. For Joffrey\u2019s murder. He did not do it. But he did not want me to be brought down with him, so he handed me to Brienne of Tarth.\u201d</p><p>Y/N looked to the woman at his side. Amazement beaming in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou were sworn to the kingsguard of my uncle Renly.\u201d</p><p>Brienne looked surprise at the amazement on the princess\u2019 face and at her knowledge.</p><p>\u201cThat is right m\u2019lady.\u201d</p><p>Y/N smirked at the woman.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need to be shocked. I made sure I knew everyone who was associated with my family. Even after I left Kingslanding and Winterfell. I still found my ways to know. The only reason I don\u2019t know now is because I died.\u201d</p><p>The table went awkwardly silent. </p><p>Y/N rolled her eyes.</p><p>\u201cLighten up. I am alive aren\u2019t I. You will need to tell me everything later. I need to know it all. I am just glad that everyone here is safe. I do hope Arya, Bran and Rickon have survived as well.\u201d</p><p>Sansa looked towards Jon.</p><p>\u201cThe Bolton\u2019s have Rickon.\u201d</p><p>Anger surged through Y/N\u2019s veins. It seemed that this war would never end. </p><p>\u201cWe will get him back, I promise. We will get back Winterfell, we will find Bran and Arya, and we will end this war.\u201d </p><p>Determination laced the Baratheon\u2019s tone. The group startled at the woman\u2019s words. But slowly, one by one, they raised their glasses, ready to fight for this battle.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-<br>A battle is what they fought victoriously against Ramsay Bolton and his men. Y/N refused to stand a side; fighting on the battle field. With Podrick and Brienne having travelled to Riverrun at the command of Sansa, Y/N made sure to protect Sansa with all her might. Even escorting her to the dungeons as she unleashed the hounds onto Ramsay. Watching from the side as the man who had defiled her friend, die at the paws of his hounds. </p><p>Y/N watched on as Jon named Sansa the Lady of Winterfell. She watched on as Jon was claimed King of the North. But she refused to watch on as Jon prepared to leave for Dragonstone to meet the Khaleesi.</p><p>\u201cI am coming with you and that is final. My uncle is alive. He sent the letter. I want to see him, and I am not leaving you.\u201d</p><p>Jon raised his head to the sky, becoming quickly frustrated with the woman in front of him.</p><p>\u201cWhat happens if this goes south?\u201d</p><p>Y/N huffed at the man in front of her, crossing her arms.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re in the North, wherever we go will go South. Except for Castle Black, and we\u2019ve only just come back from there.\u201d</p><p>Jon was not in the mood for her smart mouth. </p><p>The pair continued to bicker, unaware of those that watched on.</p><p>\u201cThis sounds familiar.\u201d</p><p>Sansa giggled at Tormund\u2019s words, having heard a similar conversation occur multiple times between the pair.</p><p>\u201cThis was my life before we left. If they were not causing trouble for each other, they were causing trouble for everyone else. Usually with Robb beside them.\u201d</p><p>Tormund nodded his head. </p><p>\u201cAnd he still has not admitted his love for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Neither has she for him.\u201d</p><p>Sansa could not help but scoff at the duo\u2019s ideocracy.</p><p>\u201cJon I am not letting you leave again. We are both alive for a reason.\u201d</p><p>Jon grasped the woman\u2019s shoulder with his right hand. Bending his head slightly so that they were eye level.</p><p>\u201cAnd I want to keep you alive. That is why you are not coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWatch me.\u201d</p><p>Before she could even try to walk away, Y/N was yanked back by Jon. Being pulled flush against his chest as his lips slammed into her own.</p><p>Sansa and Tormund looked on in surprise.</p><p>\u201cWe spoke too soon.\u201d</p><p>Y/N moved her hands to tangle into Jon\u2019s hair. His own hand\u2019s gravitating towards her lower waist. The lips locked in a passionate embrace; exerting years of pent up emotion. Love, frustration, desire, sadness, and more rolled into this one action between the pair. Their lungs begging for air as they simultaneously broke the kiss. The space between their bodies not moving an inch. Both their chests heaved for breath. Y/N biting her swollen lip as Jon\u2019s lust filled gaze stared into her own.</p><p>\u201cThat was long overdue.\u201d</p><p>Jon chuckled at Y/N\u2019s words.</p><p>\u201cI would say so.\u201d</p><p>In her peripheral vision, Y/N could see Sansa smirking at the pair with Tormund at her side; a beaming smile on the man\u2019s face. </p><p>Shaking her head, with a smile permanently fixed, Y/N gazed at the man in front of her. </p><p>\u201cI am coming with you. A kiss like that gives me even more reasons to be at your side. Don\u2019t want you falling in love with this Dragon Queen, now do I?\u201d</p><p>Jon groaned, throwing his head back at the woman\u2019s words; continuing to over react as it caused the woman he loved to laugh.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>With her hands still in his hair, Y/N pulled his head back to her own. Their foreheads leaning on one another. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not getting rid of me again Jon Snow.\u201d</p><p>Jon smiled back at Y/N.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t intend to.\u201d</p><p>Y/N simply smiled back.</p><p>Hopping aboard the boat with Jon and Davos, the trio prepared to set sail to Dragonstone. To meet the Queen of Dragons and to take the next step in the Game of Thrones.\u00a0</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-<br>The trio sailed for weeks before they arrived. Y/N and Jon having become like their younger selves once more. Causing mischief for one another and for Davos. The man could not believe his eyes; seeing the Baratheon princess and the Stark bastard act so care free. He let them be, for once they would arrive to Dragonstone, all carefree antics would be out the window once more. </p><p>Looking into the crystal blue waters, Y/N breathed in the crisp see air. Jon moving to stand behind her, his hands encircling her waist as he laid his chin on her shoulder. </p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve survived this far. Do you think we will make it home?\u201d</p><p>Y/N\u2019s words were serious and deeply questioning. She wasn\u2019t sure herself if they would make it home. If the Queen would comply with their plan.</p><p>Jon\u2019s hands squeezed Y/N tighter to his chest. Her own hands raising to place over his, stroking her thumb across the rough, calloused skin. Bending his head down, Jon placed a kiss on her neck. Keeping his head in the crook of her neck as he breathed deeply in and out. He had taken accustom to doing so when he wanted to be reminded that she was here. Truly here with him. For he had imagined her touch so many times, that it took more than her hold to bring to reality that she was her; at his side.</p><p>\u201cI will do anything I can for us to make it home. To make it back to Winterfell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhether its Winterfell, Castle Black, or even further North of this world, as long as you, Greywind and Tormund are by my side, I know I will be okay.\u201d</p><p>The pair stared out into the ocean; allowing the silence to encompass them. </p><p>A mere few days later, the trio arrived at Dragonstone. Docking the ship at the harbour, Jon and Davos walked down the ramp of the ship to meet their awaiting company. Y/N staying on the ships a few minutes longer; making sure that all was secure for the journey home. Stood at the end of the dock was not only Y/N\u2019s uncle Tyrion, but Missandei and Greyworm; ready to escort the guests to their queen.</p><p>\u201cThe bastard of Winterfell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe dwarf of Casterly Rock.\u201d</p><p>Tyrion and Jon both stared at each for a moment, quickly breaking into smiles. They stepped forward and shook hands.</p><p>\u201cI believe we last saw each other on top of the wall.\u201d</p><p>Jon chuckled, remembering the moment ever so clearly.</p><p>\u201cYou were pissing off the edge, if I remember right. You picked up some scars along the road.\u201d</p><p>Tyrion nodded his head in agreement.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a long road. But we\u2019re both still here.\u201d</p><p>Turning to address Davos, Tyrion introduced himself to the gentleman.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Tyrion Lannister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDavos Seaworth.\u201d</p><p>The pair shook hands in acknowledgement.</p><p>\u201cAh, the Onion Knight. We fought on opposite sides at the Battle of Blackwater Bay.\u201d</p><p>Davos chortled.</p><p>\u201cUnluckily for me.\u201d</p><p>Moving a step backwards, Tyrion introduced Missandei to the two guests. The woman bowing her head in respect to the two men.</p><p>\u201cWelcome to Dragonstone. Our queen knows this is a long journey. She appreciates the effort you have made on her behalf. If you wouldn\u2019t mind handing over your weapons.\u201d</p><p>Jon looked at Davos and his men.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not giving over my weapons. No fucking way. Not whilst we are on foreign land.\u201d</p><p>The men and woman all turned to the sound of the new voice.</p><p>Y/N walked her way down the plank and to her accompanying men. Head held high, she situated herself to the right of Jon. Making it clear she was not letting go of her bow and arrow, or her sword. Her hand holding it tightly as it laid sheathed at her side.</p><p>Tyrion did not recognise his niece as she travelled closer to group. The face only becoming familiar once she ceased her steps, standing alongside the bastard of Winterfell. The last he had seen of her was before she and her family departed for Winterfell. Her dark brown hair long and luxurious like her mothers. She had been draped in the colours of both House Lannister and Baratheon. Now, as she stood before him, her hair laid half up and half down; slightly shorter than it had been before. Her body draped under fur upon fur; mixtures of browns, greys, and tans. She stood taller, stronger, more prepared for danger. Nothing like the innocent Baratheon he had last seen. Her face scarred from not only the Red Wedding but from the dangers she had faced whilst playing the Game of Thrones.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re alive?\u201d</p><p>Y/N could not help but chuckle at her uncle\u2019s shock. She knew her family thought of her as dead. Her where about had not been recorded since the destruction of the Red Wedding. Not until now anyways.</p><p>\u201cAs are you uncle Tyrion. Seems we both took a hit to the face.\u201d</p><p>The man touched his scarred cheek, staring directly at the one that laid across the right side of Y/N\u2019s face. Slightly pink due to the rough wind and cold breeze.</p><p>\u201cWhilst you were scarred in battle, I was scarred in a massacre. At the order of my own grandfather.\u201d</p><p>Tyrion looked guiltily to the ground. Keeping his gaze fixed to the floor, he replied to his dearest niece.</p><p>\u201cI took care of him.\u201d</p><p>Y/N refused to drop her anger fuelled expression. She may have loved her uncle Tyrion, but to see a member of her family for the first time in so long, brought forward the repressed hatred she held towards her mother, grandfather, and other Lannister\u2019s involved.</p><p>\u201cI know. He deserved what he got. He should never have treated you the way that he did.\u201d</p><p>Tyrion raised his head in surprise. Staring at the woman before him.</p><p>\u201cHe should have never called the order of the Red Wedding.\u201d</p><p>As the group became silence over the woman\u2019s malice filled words, Jon placed his hand on top of her own. Squeezing it ever so slightly; motioning that he was there for her. She squeezed back.</p><p>Missandei stepped forward, standing slightly behind Tyrion. </p><p>\u201cThe Khaleesi wishes to speak to you all at once of your arrival. But first, your weapons please.\u201d</p><p>Y/N went to argue once more, only choosing not due to the look she gained from both Jon and her uncle. She felt like a teenager again. Huffing she pulled her bow and arrows from her back and unclipped her sword from her waist. Handing them over to the leader of the Unsullied.</p><p>\u201cYou better not damage them. Wildlings don\u2019t have luxuries, like a Queen, to buy new weapons when one is broken.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWildlings? I thought you were a princess?\u201d</p><p>Y/N smiled at Missandei\u2019s confusion.</p><p>\u201cI was a princess. Not anymore.\u201d</p><p>Missandei continued forward.</p><p>Davos, Y/N and Jon followed the woman on the path to where the Queen awaited. Tyrion and Greyworm trailing at the rear. </p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-Jon, Y/N and Davos approached the throne room as Dothraki guards opened the doors to allow them entrance. Coming to a halt, the group cannot help but stare at the sight of the Khaleesi, sitting highly on the intricate throne. </p><p>\u201cYou stand in the presence of Daenerys Stormborn of House Targaryen, rightful heir to the Iron Throne, rightful Queen of the Andals and the First Men, Protector of the Seven Kingdoms, the Mother of Dragons, the Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea, The Unburnt, The Breaker of Chains.\u201d</p><p>At Missandei\u2019s words, Jon turned and looked at Davos.</p><p>\u201cThis is Jon Snow. He\u2019s King in the North.\u201d</p><p>Tyrion could not help but smirk. Neither could his niece.</p><p>\u201cThank you for traveling so far, My Lords. I hope the seas weren\u2019t too rough. And who may this be accompanying you both? I was only made aware of the presence of male guests.\u201d</p><p>Y/N resisted rolling her eyes at the Targaryen woman.</p><p>Before Davos could introduce her, Tyrion cleared his throat.</p><p>\u201cThis is Princess Y/N of House Baratheon, my Queen. Oldest and only pure blood child of the former King Robert Baratheon of the Seven Kingdoms.\u201d</p><p>Y/N could not hold her tongue.</p><p>\u201cI was Princess of House Baratheon and Lannister, your Grace. But I am no longer.\u201d</p><p>Daenerys was not sure how she felt about the woman before her. Deemed a princess but refused the title.</p><p>\u201cWhy so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor the Houses in which my lineage belonged have hands soaked in blood. Mostly for the wrong reasons. I choose not to be associated with such terrors.\u201d</p><p>Daenerys took in the woman\u2019s words. </p><p>She continued to speak of the former support of House Stark to the Targaryen seat of the throne. Apologising for the actions of her father and more. Offering Jon Snow the position of Warden of the North if he swore to bend the knee.</p><p>Whilst the Khaleesi spoke to the trio, images flashed in Y/N\u2019s mind. Segments of the dreams she had whilst Melisandre resurrected her those few months ago. \u00a0The voice. The language. The destruction. It was her. The Khaleesi.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. You\u2019re not guilty of your father\u2019s crime. And I\u2019m not beholden to my ancestor\u2019s vows.\u201d</p><p>Jon began to discuss with Daenerys about the dangers of the White Walkers and the threat the Night King held. Seeking help from the woman and her armies. </p><p>\u201cDid you see three dragons flying overhead when you arrived?</p><p>The torches of fire flew above them. Like in her dream. As the memories of her dreams began to take control of her attention, Y/N\u2019s eyes misted over. It was as though a mystic force was forcing her to view these images of what may be the future. Throughout the sounds of fire and screams, Y/N heard the faint sound of a bird. Calling in the distance. The sounds of a crown.</p><p>\u201cThe Army of the Dead is real. The White Walkers are real. The Knight King is real. I\u2019ve seen them. If they get past the wall and we\u2019re squabbling amongst ourselves \u2013\u201d</p><p>He began to walk closer to the throne.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re finished.\u201d</p><p>Turning away from the Khaleesi, he faced the Baratheon woman. Concerning taking over as he saw only the white of her eyes. Her Y/E/C completely gone. </p><p>Daenerys paused. Sensing the shift in atmosphere from the Northern man.</p><p>\u201cI was born at Dragonstone. Not that I can remember it.\u201d</p><p>Standing from the throne, Daenerys began to walk towards Jon, unaware of the cause of his concern.</p><p>\u201cWe fled before Robert\u2019s assassins could find us. Robert was your father\u2019s best friend, no? I wonder if your father knew his best friend sent assassins to murder a baby girl in her crib. Not that it matters now of course. I spent my life in foreign lands. So many men have tried to kill me. I don\u2019t remember all of their names. I have been sold like a brood mare. I have been chained and betrayed, raped and defiled. Do you know what kept me standing through all those years in exile? Faith. Not in any gods. Not in myths and legends. In myself. In Daenerys Targaryen. The world hadn\u2019t seen a dragon in centuries until my children were born. The Dothraki hadn\u2019t crossed the sea. Any sea.\u201d</p><p>She ceased her steps as she neared the man in question. </p><p>\u201cThey did for me. I was born to rule the Seven Kingdoms. And I will.\u201d</p><p>Jon swivelled to face the woman. </p><p>Daenerys face fell as the colour drained from Jon\u2019s. Following his gaze as everyone moved to stare at frozen stance of Y/N. Her face contorted in fear and anguish.</p><p>Y/N lip began to quiver as the sound of screams and fire became too much to handle. When all of the sudden, her breaths stopped. Her lips quivered no more. While Y/N eyes were still misty, her gaze was now transfixed on the Khaleesi. Her eyebrows furrowed, and terror was still apparent across her features. </p><p>Jon moved to stand closer to the woman, worried that she could collapse at any moment. </p><p>\u201cY/N?\u201d</p><p>Her gaze did not waver. With her eyes on the Khaleesi, and the sound of screams and fire dissipating in her mind, Y/N uttered a warning. High Valyrian leaving her tongue as though it was her mother language. The words sending a shiver of fear down the Khaleesi\u2019s spine.</p><p>\u201cAsh kessa ropagon toliot se s\u012bkuda D\u0101r\u0233ti. \u00a0Syt lo se suvion won\u2019t oss\u0113nagon \u012blva, perzys kessa.\u201d<br>(Ash will fall over the seven kingdoms. For if the ice won\u2019t kill us, fire will.)</p><p>Once the words left her mouth, Y/N breathed once more. The mist in her eyes slowly evaporated; coming back to her sense. </p><p>Shaking her head, Y/N looked around at the people in the room. Confused at why the Khaleesi and everyone else looked towards her in either worry or shock.</p><p>Locking her gaze on Jon, she grabbed his hand.</p><p>\u201cAre we done? Is it time to rest now because I have a large headache.\u201d</p><p>No one uttered any argument. Even the Khaleesi did not object, nodding to Tyrion as a sign that the conversations was over. For now.</p><p>\u201cMissandei, may you please show our guests to their chambers. We will continue talks on the matter shortly.\u201d</p><p>Tightening his hold on Y/N\u2019s hand, Jon could not tear his eyes away from his woman as they were escorted to their temporary chambers.</p><p>\u201cY/N?\u201d</p><p>Continuing to walk between Jon and Davos, Y/N turned her gaze to the Onion Knight.</p><p>\u201cYes, Davos?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you speak more than one language fluently?\u201d</p><p>Instantly the girl replied.</p><p>\u201cYes. I speak three.\u201d</p><p>The duo awaited her answer.</p><p>\u201cI speak our mother tongue, sarcasm, and Tormund.The man makes up his own words. You get used to them.\u201d</p><p>The two men looked towards one another. A silent conversation discussed between them. They would need to look into this matter further tomorrow. But as for then, they were all due a rest. For the weeks ahead in Dragonstone was to become some of the most active and challenging.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-During their stay in Dragonstone, Jon had convinced Daenerys to give her hand in support against the White Walkers. Gaining sufficient amounts of Dragon glass to help prepare the weaponry for the war. Since the meeting with Daenerys, Y/N\u2019s words were not discussed. However, the Dragon Queen kept a close eye on the Baratheon. Stunned at the woman\u2019s words and sudden eloquence of High Valyrian. For a woman who had denounced her title and lived amongst Wildlings, Daenerys could see she was powerful. And when Y/N interacted with the Queen\u2019s dragons for the first time, Daenerys could see how strong that power truly was.</p><p>Whilst Jon and Davos assisted with the mining of Dragon glass, Y/N had found much time on her hands. Becoming acquainted with her uncle once more, and even learning more about the ruling of the Khaleesi. She was clearly loved by many. Especially her dragons. </p><p>Y/N had not meant to wander as far as where the dragons were held. But she was bored. And with Jon out of the castle, there was not much she could do. Walking across the grounds she whistled to herself, shuffling her feet as she walked. All of a sudden, the harsh sounds of flapping wings could be heard. Y/N looked up to the sky, to see Drogon descend to the ground, Y/N quickly stepped back. Keeping a safe distance from the creature. He was the child of the Khaleesi, and Y/N felt that the Queen was still not particularly fond of her.</p><p>Once Drogon reached the ground, the dragon roared loudly into the sky. Y/N covered her ears at the screech; instantly beginning to panic. The Khaleesi probably was already on her way. Accusing her of harming her dragon. </p><p>\u201cNo. No. Please stop screeching. I am not going to hurt you. Look I am really small. I have no weapons. I\u2019ll even take off my furs if it makes you shut the fuck up.\u201d</p><p>In her panic ridden words, Y/N pulled of her cloak, and carefully placed it onto the ground. The dragon sensed the woman\u2019s panic; stopping his roars. Drogon\u2019s eyes pierced into Y/N. Watching her as she stood a mere few feet away from the creature; her arms held up in surrender.</p><p>Elsewhere in the castle, Jon had arrived at the throne room, discussing with Tyrion and Daenerys about the next step in the plan; capturing a white beyond the wall. The roar from Drogon had startled them all, causing the trio to rush to the location of the noise. Greywind, Missandei, and Davos all hot on their trails as they emerged from their own locations.</p><p>But when they arrived at the heart of the noise, no one could believe their eyes. For Y/N no longer stood far away from the dragon; fear and panic taking over her features. But she stood next to the dragon\u2019s enormous head, stroking the creature\u2019s snout in a soothing matter. Rhaegal and Viserion had arrived between the time it took for the group to arrive. Each at either side of Drogon. All staring at Y/N in the same content and soothed manner.</p><p>\u201cOne night, I hold on you<br>Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, you<br>Castamere, Castamere, Castamere, Castamere<br>A coat of gold, a coat of red<br>A lion still has claws<br>And mine are long and sharp, my Lord<br>As long and sharp as yours.\u201d</p><p>Daenerys slowly stepped forward. Y/N still blissfully unaware of the group.</p><p>\u201cWhat is she singing?\u201d</p><p>Tyrion came to stand by his Queen.</p><p>\u201cIt is the song of House Lannister, my Queen.\u201d</p><p>Y/N never let her eyes drift from the dragon\u2019s. Resting her own head on its snout as her hand travelled to stroke the dragon\u2019s neck. She felt a connection with the creature. </p><p>\u201cAnd so, I speak, and so I speak<br>A girl of House of the Dear.<br>And now I weep, and now I weep<br>For the friends who are no longer here.\u201d</p><p>Tyrion exhaled a deep breath.</p><p>\u201cThat my Queen\u2026 is not part of the song of House Lannister or Baratheon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Everyone\u2019s gaze locked on Y/N. Surprised that she had finally acknowledged their presence.</p><p>\u201cIt is part of me.\u201d</p><p>Jon held his breath at her words. Watching in sorrow as a tear not only fell from Y/N\u2019s eyes, but the three dragons as well. </p><p>Daenerys raged within. She was powerful indeed. If she had been able to connect with her children, moving them to tears, Daenerys would have to do all she can to keep the woman on her side. For even though Y/N did not wish for the seven kingdoms, Daenerys knew that she could still grasp it from the Targaryen\u2019s hands.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-<br>When the night drew in, Y/N and Jon travelled to their chambers. Aware that their days ahead would be filled with difficult decisions and extreme conditions. </p><p>Even though the pair had shared chambers throughout their travels, they still ceased to have consummated their relationship. Both feared what the physical action could change between them. They knew of their love for one another. They had died for each other and would do so again. And yet neither had uttered those words. But in a world, such as their own, change was inevitable. </p><p>Once the duo had entered their chamber, Y/N discarded of her furs once more, pulling of her boots and untucking her shirt. Jon could see that she was still emotional. It seemed her emotions from her moment with the dragons had not dissipated. </p><p>Jon would usually leave Y/N to unchanged for bed, changing in one of the large bathrooms down the hall. However, he could not seem to have it in him to leave her alone at this moment. </p><p>Y/N began to get more frustrate with herself as she tried and failed to unbuckle her sword. Jon watched as she quickly gave up the task, holding her head in her hands in frustration. She had not felt this overwhelmed since the moment Jon arrived in the Wildling\u2019s camp. Seeing her uncle again, the segments of dreams, her moment with the dragons, and the tension she felt from Daenerys, all became too much. Tears fell from her eyes and into her hands. </p><p>Jon\u2019s heart broke at the sight of Y/N crying. He had only seen her cry few times of the years they spent together. Most of which had been the last few years. He missed when times were easier, brighter, happier. When all he thought about was marrying her. He still thought about it. But this game had clouded his brain; stealing time that he could have had with her. He did not want any more time to be lost.</p><p>Walking across the room, Jon lowered to his knee in front of Y/N. Pulling her hands away from her face, Jon wiped away the tears that rolled down her cheeks. Slowly placing his lips onto her own, gently caressing his mouth across hers. He wanted her to know he was there. That he had always been there. Y/N reciprocated the gesture. Allowing her arms to travel to the man\u2019s hair, pulling his raven locks free from its confines. Enveloping her hands through the tresses. Jon could not help but moan at the feeling. Pulling back, he muttered the words that had always been there. But had never been said.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Y/N Baratheon. I loved you from the moment you arrived with your father for your annual visit when I was 12 years old. I loved you then and I love you now.\u201d</p><p>Jon waited for a reply. The room filled with silence. Y/N\u2019s hands still in his hair as she stared at the man in disbelief. Jon began to regret his decision when suddenly, Y/N began to giggle. The giggle soon turned into a boisterous laugh as a large smile overtook her face.</p><p>Jon looked on in hurt and confusion.</p><p>Seeing his confused state, Y/N pulled Jon\u2019s face down to her own, placing a chaste kiss onto his mouth. </p><p>\u201cI love you too, Jon Snow. There was a reason I did not want to marry Robb. I had another Stark in mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d</p><p>Y/N giggled, her right hand moving to hold Jon\u2019s neck. </p><p>\u201cNo, Sansa. Yes, you. It has always been you Jon.\u201d</p><p>To say he was elated would be an understatement. That moment, Jon knew however this game ended, if Y/N was by his side, he could withstand the most ruthless leaders and most horrendous torture, as long as she was alive.</p><p>With the confessions of their love, the moment elevated their relationship emotionally and physically. For that night Y/N and Jon became each other\u2019s half. Consummating their relationship\u2026 more than once. Deep down, they had always known that they held love for each other, but they both had to grow as people; as their own individuals. </p><p>The cherished moment seemed to have sparked a light in the pair. For after that night, they refused to leave each other\u2019s side. Words of love and encouragement shared in intimate moments. They still caused trouble for each other as much as they did when they were younger, but now all Y/N and Jon could feel was each other\u2019s love. And they would both do anything to keep the other safe.</p><p>The duo and Davos soon saw their group expand. Heading to Eastwatch-by-the-Sea to capture a White Walker, they had gathered Tormund, Jorah Mormont, Gendry, Sandor Clegane, Thoros, Beric Dondarrion, and a few others along the way. With the loss of Thoros, a few other men, as well as Viserion at the hand of the Night King. Jon and his group had travelled to Kings Landing, to ask for the assistance of Queen Cersei against the White Walkers. Y/N had refused to attend. Her mother and uncle Jaime still blissfully unaware of her livelihood. She could not face her mother, after everything she had done. Not yet.</p><p>Winterfell was their next adventure. Travelling by boat with the Khaleesi and her hands, Jon wrapped his arms around Y/N\u2019s waist. The same as he did all those months ago when they had voyaged to Dragonstone. She turned in his hold, running her hands over the man\u2019s shoulders. </p><p>\u201cAre you ready? Ready to be back in Winterfell. With your family. With me.\u201d she questioned her partner.</p><p>Jon looked down at the woman in his arms.</p><p>\u201cI have never been so ready for anything else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither have I.\u201d</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-Laying in the chambers that had once been his brothers, Jon turned to his side to see Y/N still fast asleep. Tired from the journey they had taken to Winterfell with the Khaleesi and her army. She had been feeling more tired in the past few weeks, blaming it on the numerous exertions beyond the wall, having to deal with Jon and Tormund every day, and her body still getting used to being alive once more.</p><p>Jon admired his beloved, wrapping his arm around the woman, pulling her to lay as near to him as possible. He watched as Greywind slowly move closer to the bed, placing his head on top of Y/N\u2019s stomach. Jon dismissed the action, not thinking anything of the creature\u2019s behaviour.</p><p>A smile overtook the man\u2019s face. Leaning down, he placed a chaste kiss on Y/N\u2019s forehead, smiling even wider when her own face broke out into a sleep filled smile. Still unconscious, Y/N reached out her hand in Jon\u2019s direction. Jon instantly tangling it with his own. Laying his head down to rest, Jon shut his eyes. They would both need sleep to prepare themselves for the inevitable war.</p><p>However, what both of the wild spirits failed to realise that they no longer had to keep each other safe, but also the life that was growing as they slept. Greywind nuzzled Y/N\u2019s stomach, hearing a small heart beat loud and clear.</p><p>For Jon may have thought to have been a bastard and Y/N a princess of House Baratheon and Lannister, but their child would be so much more. A child of the Houses Targaryen, Lannister, Baratheon, and Stark. A child of the Wildlings and rightful heir to the Iron Throne. A child of the North, South, East and West. A child that would create a new world. </p><p><br></p><p><b>A/N- Woah, three weeks of non-stop writing as well as exams. My next piece is either going to be Podrick or Sandor Clegane.

Yes that is correct.</i></b></p><p><b><i>Warnings- death, angst, murder, spoilers (bit late now), fluff, and everything in between.</i></b></p><hr /><p>&ldquo;I bet you can&rsquo;t shoot an arrow through the middle of the target.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I bet I can.&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N Baratheon was not a girl to be challenged. Especially by Jon Snow. Her closest and dearest friend from the North. </p><p>Ever since her father, King Robert Baratheon, and Ned Stark had formed an allegiance, Y/N had travelled with her father to Winterfell every month. Being the only true born Baratheon of her siblings, Y/N and her father was very close. Whilst Robert and Eddard Stark discussed important royal matters, Y/N and Jon were often causing trouble. From antagonising each other to cause mayhem, or choosing to do so on their own terms, the two together were a handful. With Robb added to the duo, the chaos greatly increased. For the trio showed no mercy with their mischief.</p><p>Robb smirked at the younger duo. Leaning against the pillar, he watched on as Y/N furiously grabbed her bow and arrows. </p><p>&ldquo;If you shoot the arrow through the target, you can have my portion of shank at dinner tonight.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon knew she would never back down the chance to have more food. Even though the Baratheon&rsquo;s was one of the strongest families in all the kingdoms, the House of Stark produced the most glorious food in the kingdoms. Food that tasted like it was made with love and from the heart. </p><p>Squinting at the young bastard, Y/N nodded. </p><p>&ldquo;Deal. And if I miss?&rdquo;</p><p>Jon looked at Robb, a smirk forming on both of their faces.</p><p>&ldquo;You have to wear a dress at dinner tonight. And we mean, a dress preserved for weddings and balls; not any sort of old tat.&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N glared towards Robb as he spoke the conditions. Looking back at Jon, she waited to hear his opinion. </p><p>The young man winked at the young woman, shrugging his shoulders as though he did not know what Robb was going to say. He did. They had agreed on her punishment earlier that morning.</p><p>The young Baratheon loathed dresses. Refusing to wear them, unless for extravagant events; much to her mothers&rsquo; chagrin. She preferred to wear breeches and a tunic instead. They were more form fitting than that of a man&rsquo;s; for her mother only appeased with the clothing if it could be altered to uphold some femininity. </p><p>The boys waited with baited breathes for her response.</p><p>&ldquo;Deal.&rdquo;</p><p>Cheers rang from the pair. Y/N shook Jon&rsquo;s hand. Watching as the young bastard walked towards Robb, and away from the direction of the target. And any areas around it. They were all still learning to shoot, so It was no surprise that an arrow wold stray every now and then.</p><p>Taking a deep breath in, Y/N closed her eyes, slowing her breathing down. Opening her eyes, she raised her bow and arrow. Pulling the string back with necessary force, her vision zeroed in on the target. Moving her aim so that the arrow should fly straight through the centre. Taking one last inhale, she begins to release the string of the bow when-</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N!&rdquo;</p><p>The shout of her name caused Y/N to flinch, the arrow flying through the air. Embedding itself into the target. Just to the right of the bullseye. </p><p>Y/N groaned, throwing the bow to the floor, she swivelled to the direction of the shout. Looking towards the balcony, Y/N stared at her father. </p><p>&ldquo;Father look what you did. You just cost me an extra shank you knob.&rdquo;</p><p>Many would have been shocked to have heard how the princess spoke to the king, but it was normal. The two Baratheon&rsquo;s were not the conventional pair.</p><p>King Robert chuckled heartily. With Eddard at his side, who raised an eyebrow in his son&rsquo;s direction. The two boys bowering the heads, to hide their laughter.</p><p>&ldquo;All of you get ready for the banquet tonight. Robb come with me and your father. We have matters to discuss.&rdquo;</p><p>The three friends looked at each other in confusion. Robb shrugged his shoulders as he walked in the direction of your father and his. </p><p>&ldquo;I wonder what they need him for.&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N walked towards Jon. The pair watching as Robb and their fathers head into the castle.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, you better start getting ready. Who knows how long it&rsquo;ll take to get into your dress.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon laughed as Y/N turned towards him, stepping so close that their breathes mingled. Leaning impossible closer to his face, Y/N glared into Jon&rsquo;s eyes. </p><p>&ldquo;I may have missed the bullseye, but if that was a real man, it would have gone straight through his heart.&rdquo;</p><p>At the end of her words, Y/N moved back from their proximity and walked in the direction of her chambers. Jon staring at how her hips swayed as she aggressively walked further away. </p><p>Flittering his gaze between his chest and the target, he realised she was right. Shaking his head, Jon began his trek towards his own chambers. The only thought flittering through his mind was how he was one day going to marry Y/N Baratheon; bastard or not. He was going to make it a reality.</p><p><br /></p><p>The banquet had begun 20 minutes before Y/N had arrived. Robb sitting next to his siblings and parents at the head of the hall. Even Theon was sat amongst the Starks. For once, Catelyn had allowed Jon to attend; to appease Y/N&rsquo;s begs of her friend being present. &nbsp;Sitting away from all Baratheon&rsquo;s and Starks, Jon conversed with his uncle Benjen, speaking of matters that could affect his future greatly.</p><p>Jon had been awaiting Y/N&rsquo;s arrival. When she had walked through the door, he could not help but catch his breath. Neither could Robb, or any young man in close proximity. Whilst Jon could not tear his eyes away from Y/N, his uncle Benjen left Jon to ogle.</p><p>&ldquo;Bloody hell. She should be bent over and ravished in that dress.&rdquo;</p><p>Robb elbowed Theon in his stomach. Causing the ward to lose his breath; coughing on the lack of it.</p><p>Y/N looked at the table at the head of the room. Seeing her plate next to her fathers and her mothers. Walking towards it, she reached where it laid. </p><p>At the sight of their daughter, her parents ceased their conversation. </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re finally looking like a lady Y/N. What has caused this drastic change? Or should I ask whom?&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N rolled her eyes at her mother&rsquo;s words.</p><p>Going to grab her plate, she hiked up her skirt to climb up the platform to the table. </p><p>Piling more vegetables and mashed potatoes on her sparsely filled plate (most likely her mother&rsquo;s doing) she shoved her shank into her mouth, ripping off a large portion of the meat. With her plate in one hand, and her shank in the other, Y/N pointed at her father with the bone of meat. Amusement clear on his face. Whilst her mother and siblings held disgust. Laughter could be heard from the Stark children at her antics.</p><p>&ldquo;Stupid bets with the stupid Stark boys. I would have had it if father had not called for me.&rdquo;</p><p>Robert bellowed with laughter at his daughter&rsquo;s frustration. </p><p>She turned to glare at him, however, she could not keep a smile from taking over.</p><p>&ldquo;Because of that, I am going to sit with Jon. The poor bastard is probably bored out of his mind.&rdquo;</p><p>Cersei shook her head at her daughter&rsquo;s words.</p><p>&ldquo;You will do no such thing.&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N bore her eyes into her mother&rsquo;s, taking another bite out of her shank.</p><p>Chewing the meat ever so slowly, she swallowed the chunk. Throwing the bone on her plate, she licked her fingers clean; angering her mother even more. </p><p>&ldquo;Let her mother, she&rsquo;s acting like a homeless harlot any way.&rdquo;</p><p>Whipping her head towards Joffrey, she took in his words. Looking her younger brother up and down with a glare that could kill, the young Lannister swallowed harshly.</p><p>Heading to walk past the Starks and down the steps of the platform, she kept her eyes on Joffrey, stopping to stand in front of the young Stark girls.</p><p>&ldquo;Sansa cover your ears.&rdquo;</p><p>The girl did so.</p><p>Directing her words back to Joffrey, she smirked at her brother.</p><p>&ldquo;You can call me a harlot. But at least I&rsquo;m not an incestuous little bitch.&rdquo;</p><p>Cersei&rsquo;s head whipped in her daughter&rsquo;s direction. Watching as she diverted her attention to the Starks.</p><p>Y/N smiled as Arya, Theon, and Robb chuckled at her words. Motioning for Sansa to uncover her ears, she knew the girl still heard. But she didn&rsquo;t care. </p><p>&ldquo;Now if you&rsquo;ll excuse me. I have fulfilled my duties and my part of the bet. So, I am going to sit with Jon and enjoy my meal.&rdquo;</p><p>As she continued her path across the platform, Y/N reached out her hand to quickly grab Theon&rsquo;s leftover shank.</p><p>The ward standing in his seat.</p><p>&ldquo;You fucking bitch! I didn&rsquo;t finish that.&rdquo;</p><p>The girl trotted down the steps, walking through the array of people backwards. </p><p>Much like she had done to her father, Y/N used the shank to point at Theon.</p><p>&ldquo;Next time you talk about bending over a girl and ravishing her without consent, think about how you will go hungry for the rest of the night.&rdquo;</p><p>Turning to face Jon, she walked towards the man; who had witnessed and heard mostly everything. </p><p>Robb sitting next to Theon, laughed as the ward fell back into his seat in a sulk. </p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s right mate.&rdquo;</p><p>Theon scoffed.</p><p>&ldquo;At least I won&rsquo;t be married to her and have her not love me back.&rdquo;</p><p>Robb stared at the Greyjoy.</p><p>&ldquo;What do you mean? She might learn to love me back.&rdquo;</p><p>Theon scoffed, continuing to eat the food left on his plate.</p><p>&ldquo;You really think her, and Jon only see each other as friends. Why do you think her father and yours are marrying her to you? Jon&rsquo;s a bastard and not a Stark. If he were, they would be married by morning.&rdquo;</p><p>Robb shifted in his seat. He knew Y/N did not see him the same as he saw her. But for others to see the obvious tension between Jon and Y/N, and he hadn&rsquo;t, made it even more real for Robb. </p><p>Sitting back in his seat Robb looked forward.</p><p>&ldquo;Remember, you aren&rsquo;t a Stark either Greyjoy. So, stop pretending that you are.&rdquo;</p><p>Theon paused his eating at Robb&rsquo;s words. Rage bubbling deep inside as he began to drink his wine excessively. </p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-</p><p>Dropping her plate in front of Jon, Y/N raised her skirt to sit comfortably on the chair. Shovelling Theon&rsquo;s shank, unattractively, into her mouth. Using her sleeve as a makeshift napkin to wipe her face.</p><p>Jon could not help but watch in amusement. </p><p>Swallowing the food, Y/N looked into her friend&rsquo;s eyes. </p><p>&ldquo;Has Ned told you?&rdquo;</p><p>Taking a swig of his wine, he placed the cup down.</p><p>&ldquo;Told me what?&rdquo;</p><p>Wiping her mouth once more, Y/N reached over to grasp Jon&rsquo;s drink, gulping some down herself.</p><p>&ldquo;My father and Ned have arranged for Robb and I to wed.&rdquo;</p><p>In disbelief, all Jon could do was stare at Y/N.</p><p>Putting his cup back on the table, Y/N leaned her head on her hand, watching herself play with her food.</p><p>&ldquo;They haven&rsquo;t told me yet. Turns out Arya over heard them tell Robb. She came to me straight away. Telling me that Robb did not argue against it, the cunt.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon licked his lips. Running his hands over his face. Looking back at the young woman in front of him, Jon analysed her expression.</p><p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;re not happy with this?&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N rolled her eyes at his question. </p><p>Waving her hand in the air, she answered.</p><p>&ldquo;Of course, I am not happy Jon. Robb is like a brother to me. I don&rsquo;t view him in that way. And unlike some people in these kingdoms, I don&rsquo;t want to fuck my family. I want to marry whomever I choose.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon laughed at her words.</p><p>&ldquo;Anyway, what did Benjen want? You seemed to be having a pretty serious conversation.&rdquo;</p><p>It was Jon&rsquo;s turn to stare at his own plate.</p><p>&ldquo;He came to inform me that he was travelling to join the Nightswatch. And I told him that I want to join too.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon raised his gaze to the girl, seeing her expression fall.</p><p>&ldquo;So, Lord Stark, Sansa, and Arya will be travelling to Kingslanding back with your family. I will follow Benjen to the wall-&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And I will be here, marrying Robb, and helping your mother tend to Bran, whilst Theon does God knows what.&rdquo;</p><p>All Jon did was nod his head. </p><p>&ldquo;Well we better make the most of today and tomorrow.&rdquo;</p><p>Raising her shank, she laughed as Jon cheered it with his own. The pair continuing to laugh throughout the feast. </p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-As there last day together approached, Y/N and Jon never left each other&rsquo;s side. Causing more mischief than ever before. King Robert and Eddard chose not to interfere, knowing that it was going to be a while before they would see each other again. Robb had also left the pair alone, for Y/N would be his wife soon, and they would be together for a long time coming. </p><p>The day went too quickly for the pair, and as morning came, Y/N could not help but feel the tears gather in her eyes at the thought of being left by her father and Jon. </p><p>Watching as Arya and Sansa left with her family in tow. She stood next to the Stark sisters as the clambered onto their horses.</p><p>&ldquo;Keep Sansa safe Arya.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I will.&rdquo; The younger Stark replied.</p><p>&ldquo;And Sansa?&rdquo;</p><p>The older Stark looked towards Y/N.</p><p>The Baratheon smiled.</p><p>&ldquo;Help yourself to all my dresses and fabric. I&rsquo;ve have never worn most of them.&rdquo;</p><p>Sansa smiled in appreciation.</p><p>Y/N&rsquo;s expression became more serious.</p><p>&ldquo;And please be careful.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I will.&rdquo;</p><p>The pair went to begin their journey to Kingslanding. </p><p>Y/N turned to the guard next to her; already mounted on his steed.</p><p>&ldquo;Please watch over them Sandor. You and I both know how evil of a cunt Joffrey is.&rdquo;</p><p>The Hound huffed at her words. Lifting the helmet, he placed it on his head.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do my best. Don&rsquo;t get yourself killed now little Doe.&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N laughed at his nickname for her, watching as her family and the Starks set of on their journey. </p><p>She had already said goodbye to her father in privacy. Not wanting to cry even more than she knew she would when she would have to say goodbye to Jon.</p><p>Once the carriage and horses were a mere speck in the horizon, she allowed herself to face Jon. Examining the exchange between him and Robb, she could feel her heart hurt at the sight. </p><p>Strolling towards them, Y/N witnessed as the Stark brother&rsquo;s let each other go. Quickly taking Robb&rsquo;s position as he left the pair to say their goodbye&rsquo;s.</p><p>Standing next to his steed, Jon watched as Y/N walked slowly towards him. Quickly gulping down the sobs in her throat, Y/N pulled Jon in too a tight embrace. Burying her head in the crook of his neck, the young pair stayed in that position for a long time, that &lsquo;just friends&rsquo; would deem too long.</p><p>Jon was the first to pull away. Holding her face in his hands, Jon stroked her cheek with his thumb. Catching the tears that had escaped her eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;I promise that we will see each other soon. You can tell me all about the married life with my brother.&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N laughed. Clutching Jon&rsquo;s furs with her fists. She pulled him closer, their heads resting against the others. A solemn look falling on her face.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to marry Robb.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon let out a breath.</p><p>&ldquo;I know. I wish you wasn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p><p>She replied.</p><p>&ldquo;So, do I. I love him, but not in the way a man and wife love another.&rdquo;</p><p>Pulling her head back, Y/N&rsquo;s hand travelled to Jon&rsquo;s neck. Her surprisingly warm fingers sending tingles down the man&rsquo;s spine.</p><p>&ldquo;Promise we will see each other again.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon nodded his head. </p><p>&ldquo;I promise.&rdquo;</p><p>As he muttered his promise, Y/N leaned her face closer to his own. Placing her lips on his cheek, she slowly pulled them away. Detaching herself from the Stark bastard, Y/N sadly smiled at Jon.</p><p>&ldquo;You better get going. By the time you get there, the snow would have melted.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon chuckled. Mounting his horse, he positioned himself comfortable on the saddle. </p><p>Benjen began to follow the Nightswatch as they started their journey out of the gates of Winterfell.</p><p>Y/N stepped back as Jon trotted his horse to catch up with his uncle. </p><p>&ldquo;Jon!&rdquo;</p><p>Turning his head, he caught Y/N&rsquo;s gaze.</p><p>&ldquo;Remember. If you ever need to, aim to the right.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon felt a large smile take over his face.</p><p>&ldquo;Straight at the heart.&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N smiled in return.</p><p>&ldquo;Straight at the heart.&rdquo;</p><p>Much like her father leaving, Y/N stood in her place. Refusing to move until Jon was a speck in the distance.</p><p>As she stood, watching Jon leave, Robb slowly approached. Standing to the side of the Baratheon princess. </p><p>The pair stood in silence. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;</p><p>Robb looked towards his soon to be wife.</p><p>&ldquo;What for?&rdquo;</p><p>She let a few tears fall.</p><p>&ldquo;I love him.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I love you too.&rdquo;</p><p>Robb turned his gaze back to the gates. The two watching as the guards shut them closed.</p><p>&ldquo;But not in the same way.&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N shook her head.</p><p>Placing a hand on Robb&rsquo;s shoulder, their eyes connected.</p><p>&ldquo;No. But I will be the best wife I can be.&rdquo;</p><p>Robb smiled at her words. He had no doubt she wouldn&rsquo;t.</p><p>Squeezing his shoulder, Y/N let her hand drop, walking away from Robb and away from the gates where she had said goodbye to her family and Jon. Walking into the castle that she now would call home. But nowhere would be home without her father. And nowhere would make her feel as happy as when she was with Jon.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-As the months passed, it became easier for Y/N to become more comfortable in her permanent residence at Winterfell. Coming to terms of her life with Robb. He was her friend, and he needed her help. Robb accepted the fact that she did not love him the same, but he knew she still cared for him deeply. And when word had come to Winterfell that King Robert Baratheon had sadly passed, Robb&rsquo;s shoulder was there for Y/N to cry on. Y/N had reciprocated the compassion when news of Ned&rsquo;s execution hit Winterfell. She hated Joffrey and her mother with a passion.</p><p>The young Baratheon was distraught. Being the closest to her father out of her siblings, she felt as though she had lost the only true family member she had. Heartbroken that she was not at his side when he sadly passed. Her tears of sorrow were soon replaced with tears of dread when she realised what would occur if anyone was to find out the true bloodline of her siblings. She had known for years of Cersei and Jaime&rsquo;s relationship. How nobody else had realised why she looked so contrasting to her siblings, Y/N prayed for the day that the truth would be revealed to never come.</p><p>However, it did, and as Joffrey sat on the Iron Throne, word had travelled around the kingdoms. Causing the War of the Five Kings to begin. With Joffrey, her uncle Stannis and Renly, Balon Greyjoy, and Robb, all fighting for the throne.</p><p>As the war surged forward, Y/N noticed that Robb&rsquo;s attention had been caught by one of the young healers; Talisa. Watching the pair converse, Y/N smiled to herself. She was happy that he had finally found true love. And at that moment of thought, Jon entered her mind. She wondered where he was now. If he ever thought of her on his travels. If he was safe, or even still alive. </p><p>On a seemingly quiet night, Catelyn approached Y/N in the drawing room. As she pulled the girl into her embrace, she informed her of the nuptials that would occur that evening.<br />&ldquo;For Robb and I?&rdquo;</p><p>Catelyn shook her head, a smile taking over her features.</p><p>&ldquo;No. For Talisa and Robb.&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N let out the breath she held. Robb was her &ldquo;brother&rdquo;, and he was finally going to get married. To someone who loved him back.</p><p>&ldquo;Thank high heavens. No disrespect Catelyn. I love your son. But not in that way.&rdquo;</p><p>The Stark woman laughed at the Baratheon&rsquo;s exclamation; enveloping her in another hug.</p><p>&ldquo;I know you mean no harm in your words. It&rsquo;s not your fault that your heart belongs to Ned&rsquo;s bastard.&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N shook her head, pulling herself out of the woman&rsquo;s grasp.</p><p>&ldquo;Give the boy some slack Catelyn. He&rsquo;s out there defending the wall for us.&rdquo;</p><p>Catelyn dismissed the girl&rsquo;s words with a wave of her hand.</p><p>&ldquo;Now let&rsquo;s get you in something more suitable for a wedding. No more breeches for the rest of the day.&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N followed begrudgingly as Catelyn helped her get ready for Robb&rsquo;s wedding. </p><p>Walking across the field, Y/N sauntered into Robb&rsquo;s tent, watching as he finished getting ready.</p><p>&ldquo;Well somebody looks like a king.&rdquo;</p><p>Robb chuckled, turning to his friend. </p><p>&ldquo;And somebody looks like a princess.&rdquo;</p><p>She rolled her eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;I am one, you dickhead.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t dress like one.&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N punched Robb&rsquo;s shoulder at his words.</p><p>Robb laughed.</p><p>&ldquo;Come one. Let&rsquo;s go get you married. This is going to be the best wedding in all the kingdoms.&rdquo;</p><p>For soon after the ceremony occurred, blood flooded the floors of the room. Waldor Frey&rsquo;s men killing everyone and anything. With Greywind at her side, and a bow in her hand, Y/N fought off many of the soldiers. Trying her best to protect Robb. </p><p>Out of nowhere, one of Frey&rsquo;s soldiers jumped from behind, swinging his dagger in Y/N&rsquo;s direction. Just as Y/N thought this would be her end, Greywind attacked the soldier&rsquo;s arm, causing the sword to slice Y/N&rsquo;s face; narrowly missing her eye. She was alive. She could deal with a cut face as long she was alive. Pulling her arrow back, she landed it perfectly into the heart of the solider; Greywind keeping him down with his grip on the man&rsquo;s arm.</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N!&rdquo;</p><p>At the shout of her name, she turned to Robb. </p><p>&ldquo;Get out of here. Take Greywind with you.&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N shook her head.</p><p>&ldquo;I am not leaving you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, you are. Go find Jon at the wall. I am not going to lose both Talisa and you. Mother and I will be okay. Go.&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N looked at Catelyn&rsquo;s direction.</p><p>&ldquo;Go.&rdquo; The women whispered.</p><p>AS Catelyn held the knife to the throat of Frey&rsquo;s wife, Y/N slipped out the room. Quickly mounting one of the horses, with Greywind at her side, and her bow on her back, she fled from the wedding and from Winterfell.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-She could feel in her bones the guilt of leaving Robb and his mother behind. Of not being able to help Talisa. Of not being able to do something more. The guilt and grief only grew more when on her way to the wall, as she stopped to eat in a small tavern, Y/N over-heard of the gruesome events that occurred after she left. Hearing men laugh as they spoke about how Waldor Frey&rsquo;s soldiers cut off Robb&rsquo;s head and paraded his body around. How Catelyn&rsquo;s throat was slit open. How Talisa was murdered, and so was her and Robb&rsquo;s unborn child.</p><p>She could not hear no more. Continuing to travel as she arrived closer and closer to the wall. Collecting weapons, furs, and food along her travels. Greywind never leaving her side. Y/N remembered the directions to the Nightswatch, having spoken to her father and Eddard about it in great deal; when she was younger. She was always fascinated by the stories of the wall, so it was no surprise that she would want to know more about the men who would be guarding it. </p><p>Y/N had been travelling for weeks when she finally arrived at the wall. Searching for a secluded space, she hopped off of her horse. Stroking the animal&rsquo;s mane, Y/N grabbed out the necessary food from her satchel. Feeding both the horse and Greywind before devouring an apple herself. She could not risk lighting a fire and cooking. It could draw unwanted attention. But what she didn&rsquo;t know was that she had already done so by being there. As she was finishing her apple, out of nowhere, Greywind began to snarl. Instantly dropping the core of her fruit, Y/N reached for her bow and arrows; standing in front of the horse with Geywind at her side. </p><p>Looking towards the area where Greywind gazed, she saw fur and lots of it, approaching where she stood at the wall. The figures moved closer and closer. Wildlings. Y/N had no time to run or hide. With the direwolf and horse by her side, she would not be able to escape quietly. Drawing her bow, Y/N made sure her weapons were secure on her body. She was not going to be killed by Wildlings. Not when she had survived this long.</p><p>As they approached, one by one, the Wildlings noticed the woman in front of them. She was dressed very similar to them. The only differences being that her furs were a mixture of red and black. Tormund stood near the front of the group with Ygritte by his side. So, it came as a very big surprise when they reached the wall to enter the watch, that a woman stood in front of it. With a bow in her hand and a huge fucking wolf snarling towards them. </p><p>Y/N pulled her bow to aim at the ginger Wildlings&rsquo; chest.</p><p>&ldquo;Take another fucking step and I will shoot this arrow straight through your heart, Wildling.&rdquo;</p><p>Tormund let out a boisterous laugh at her words.</p><p>&ldquo;Will you kill me little fox? Will you kill us all? You don&rsquo;t know who you are messing with.&rdquo;</p><p>Without missing a beat, Y/N answered.</p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p><p>Tormund continued to laugh.</p><p>&ldquo;But he will help me.&rdquo;</p><p>AT the sound of her words, Greywind began to growl louder, his body arching as he slowly strode closer to the Wildlings. </p><p>Tormund quickly became quiet. </p><p>&ldquo;Now if you don&rsquo;t let me go, I will paint this wall red with your blood and use your skulls as bowls to feed my direwolf. You hear?&rdquo;</p><p>Silence encompassed them. </p><p>&ldquo;I like her.&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N shifted her arrow to the ginger woman at her words.</p><p>Tormund&rsquo;s shocked expression moving to gaze at her as well. </p><p>Ygritte simply shrugged her shoulders. </p><p>&ldquo;She has fire. You of all people should know how strong a person kissed by fire is.&rdquo;</p><p>The Wildling&rsquo;s murmured amongst each other, looking at Tormund to respond.</p><p>Tormund looked at Ygritte. The ginger girl giving a quick nod of her head. Their silent conversation coming to an agreement.</p><p>Turning back to the Baratheon, Tormund sheathed his dagger. Taking another step closer; to only take it back as the direwolf growled once more.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay little fox. We do no harm.&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N never let her eyes leave the group. Keeping herself on edge for any attack.</p><p>&ldquo;Here me out little fox.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Do not call me fox. I am not a fox.&rdquo;</p><p>Tormund could see Ygritte smirk in the corner of his eye. Yes. She would fit right in. </p><p>&ldquo;If you have no place to stay, come with us Wildlings. You will be safe.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need your help. I am safer alone.&rdquo;</p><p>Ygritte rolled her eyes at the girl&rsquo;s words. She felt that way once too.</p><p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t be safe when the Whites arrive.&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N shook her head. Not wanting to believe her words. She had heard stories, but it has been hundreds of years since White Walkers roamed around Westeroes. But her mind suddenly reeled back to all the warnings Eddard Stark had given before his death. Winter is Coming. That is what he meant.</p><p>Slowly lowering her bow, she kept the object in a type grip at her side. Clicking her tongue, she signalled for Greywind to heel at her feet. The direwolf still on high alert.</p><p>&ldquo;If I was to come with you, you swear an oath to do me no harm.&rdquo;</p><p>Tormund laughed once more. As did many of the other Wildlings.</p><p>&ldquo;An oath? Were Wildlings. You&rsquo;re lucky to even be offered shelter.&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N continued to stare at the man, her eyes flickering to Ygritte&rsquo;s, as the woman&rsquo;s expression remained serious.</p><p>&ldquo;We swear.&rdquo;</p><p>At Ygritte&rsquo;s words, the Wildlings bellowed disagreements. </p><p>Y/N, taking Ygritte&rsquo;s word, began to lead her direwolf and horse towards the Wildlings. She trusted Ygritte. She even felt compelled to trust the big ginger one, but she still kept her eye out for any dirty bastard who would break their word.</p><p>&ldquo;Fine. We will amuse this oath. But if you are to stay with us, you will live the Wildling way. They call me Tormund Giantsbane.&rdquo;</p><p>As they began to head towards the Wildling&rsquo;s keep, Y/N walked between Tormund and Ygritte. The rest of the Wildlings in front of them. Greywind stayed close behind Y/N for protection, as she led her horse by its reigns.</p><p>&ldquo;Why Giantsbane?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I killed a giant when I was 10. Then I climbed right into bed with his wife. When she woke up, she suckled me at her teat for three months. Thought I was her baby. That&rsquo;s how I got so strong: giant&rsquo;s milk.&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N could not help but smile at the man&rsquo;s story. Confusing Tormund as many of whom he had told the story to would either look deathly afraid, repelled, or even turned on. Not amused like Y/N was.</p><p>&ldquo;Now what do they call you little fox.&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N thought whether or not to reveal her true identity. To be trusting or to be safe. She chose the latter.</p><p>&ldquo;They call me Doe.&rdquo;</p><p>Tormund looked at the woman in confusion.</p><p>&ldquo;Doe? A deer?&rdquo;</p><p>Ygritte laughed at Tormund&rsquo;s expression.</p><p>&ldquo;A female deer.&rdquo;</p><p>Tormund glared at his Wildling friend.</p><p>&ldquo;I know what a doe is, you fucker.&rdquo;</p><p>Ygritte smirked.</p><p>&ldquo;It sounded like you didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p><p>As the two bickered back and forth, walking either side of the Baratheon, Y/N could not help but reminisce of the funny quarrels between her, Robb, and Jon. She missed them both dearly. Whilst she may never be able to reunite with Robb, she knew she was so close to seeing Jon. She could feel it.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-Turns out, Y/N&rsquo;s feelings were correct. For the bastard of Eddard Stark was a lot closer than she thought. She had been living with the Wildlings for nearly a year when Ygritte had travelled back from her duties at the wall. &nbsp;But Ygritte wasn&rsquo;t alone. It seemed she had turned the tables on her capture; catching the crow herself. </p><p>As Ygritte travelled back to the Wildling den with the crow, Y/N and Tormund sat at the fire. The man watching as the woman hacked and carved the elks they and other Wildlings had caught earlier that day. She had come to take position of cook the minute she arrived. Being near the fire reminded her of life back home. She had also taken up cooking whilst living with Robb; wanting to become friendly with the servants and hand maidens that she thought would be with her for life. But how she was wrong. </p><p>During her months with the Wildlings, her skills in sword fighting had become a lot stronger. Adhering the techniques of the Wildlings, the Starks, and those her uncle Jaime had taught her, made Y/N&rsquo;s fighting style unique. Untouchable. Her skills with an arrow had no match to anyone else either. She was a strong warrior. One the Wildlings had come to admire.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve grown strong Little Doe. Nearly as strong as I.&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N smiled at Tormund&rsquo;s words. The man reminded her of her father. His contagious laugh and rosy cheeks were similar to that of the Baratheon king. Cutting the elk into pieces, Y/N placed them onto the fire. </p><p>&ldquo;And I did not need one drop of giant&rsquo;s milk.&rdquo;</p><p>Tormund bellowed with laughter at the girl&rsquo;s sarcasm. She was still a spitfire. That aspect had not changed.</p><p>Y/N had come to adapt to the Wildling lifestyle very quickly. Most of it not being that different to her adventures with Jon and Robb. Hunting, sparring, and amongst other training activities. She was more comfortable here than she had ever been under the gaze of her mother. No dresses in sight. Just thick furs and weapons. Jon would have fit right in, she thought. </p><p>Wiping her hands on her trousers, Y/N stood up, handing some already cooked food to Tormund. The man began to devour the food instantly. </p><p>&ldquo;I am going to give the rest of this food out to the ones who have yet to eat. So, don&rsquo;t think about eating my plate or else the last words out of your mouth would have been about how strong I am. Got it Tor?&rdquo;</p><p>The man held up a thumb, shoving the rest of his forkful into his mouth. He had learnt that the young woman did not kid when it meant food was involved.</p><p>Picking up the large box of prepared food, Y/N trudged out the camp and headed towards the groups of Wildlings she had left to feed. The women and children smiled at her arrival. The men nodding their heads in respect. She began to hand out the meals; blissfully unaware of Ygritte and many other Wildlings entering the camp with Jon Snow at their side. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey Dongo?&rdquo;</p><p>The giant stopped hammering the pole at the sound of his name. He smiled once he saw it was Little Doe. Even the giants had come to care for the Baratheon. Everyone treated her as though she was a born and raised Wildling.</p><p>As Y/N&rsquo;s attention was aimed at feeding the giant, she failed to see the crow, behind the large beast, being ushered into the main tent. Grabbing a large slab of shank out of her box, she handed the meat to the giant. </p><p>&ldquo;If you want anymore, Xera is also cooking in the tent over there. You&rsquo;ve worked really hard today.&rdquo;</p><p>The giant nodded in appreciation, watching as Y/N carried on weaving through the groups of Wildlings to feed the hungry.</p><p>&ldquo;I smell a crow.&rdquo;</p><p>Tormund had ceased eating once he felt the presence of a stranger in the tent. Ygritte stood to one side of Jon, as the Lord of Bones stood at the other. The man pulling of his mask as he spoke.</p><p>&ldquo;We killed his friends. Thought you&rsquo;d want to question this one.&rdquo;</p><p>Tormund kept his back to the trio.</p><p>&ldquo;What do we want with a baby crow?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;This baby killed Qhorin Halfhand. He wants to be one of us.&rdquo;</p><p>At Ygritte&rsquo;s words, Tormund stood from his seat; staring at Jon.</p><p>&ldquo;That half-handed cunt killed friends of mine. Friends twice your size.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon took deep breaths. Trying to not show his fear.</p><p>&ldquo;My father told me big men fall just as quick as little ones if you put a sword through their hearts.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Plenty of little men tried to put their swords through my heart. And there&rsquo;s plenty of little skeletons buried in the woods. What&rsquo;s your name, boy?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Jon Snow.&rdquo;</p><p>Tormund&rsquo;s face changed to one of confusion. Having remembered a time when the Little Doe had mentioned a man named Jon. No last name. But it had been one of the few times she had talked so openly of her past. Of a boy she had grown besides, who had to leave to protect the place he lived.</p><p>Jon kneeled before Tormund, mistaking him for Mance Rayder, the King-beyond-the-Wall.</p><p>&ldquo;Your Grace.&rdquo;</p><p>The wildlings laughed, Tormund ignoring his thoughts.</p><p>&ldquo;Your Grace? Did you hear that? From now on, you&rsquo;d better kneel every time I fart.&rdquo;</p><p>With the Wildlings laughing, Mance Rayder appeared from the shadows, heading towards the crow.</p><p>&ldquo;Stand, boy. We don&rsquo;t kneel for anyone beyond the Wall.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon raised to his feet, watching the man before him.</p><p>&ldquo;So, you&rsquo;re Ned Stark&rsquo;s bastard. Thank you for the gift, Lord of Bones. You can leave us.&rdquo;</p><p>The lord of Bones left, Ygritte soon following in tow. As she exited the tent, Y/N approached the woman, food already in hand. </p><p>&ldquo;Here you go Ygritte. Just heard you had arrived back. With company as well. Who&rsquo;s the poor soul this time?&rdquo;</p><p>Ygritte smirked at the girl&rsquo;s words. Much like Tormund, the girl had spoken of a Jon. But had given no name. However, with the details she had told, Ygritte knew the man in the tent was the man Y/N had spoken about. Not wanting to give anything away, Ygritte took the food from the woman. </p><p>&ldquo;You know, just some crow. We killed the rest. Thought this one could be useful, He&rsquo;s in there with Mance and Tormund. Head in if you like.&rdquo;</p><p>At the end of her words, Ygritte walked away, watching from her peripheral vision as Y/N began to walk into the tent.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;As she stood outside the tent, Y/N could hear Mance Rayder and Tormund tormenting the poor crow.</p><p>&ldquo;The girl likes you. You like her back, Snow? That why you want to join us?&rdquo;</p><p>As she quietly stepped into the tent, Y/N body became rigid at the sight of dark black curls. It couldn&rsquo;t be.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t panic, boy. This isn&rsquo;t the damned Night&rsquo;s Watch where we make you swear off girls.&rdquo;</p><p>Tormund came to stand at the entrance, his face turning to see Y/N frozen in the doorway. Concern taking over his features.</p><p>&ldquo;This chicken eater you thought was king is Tormund Giantsbane.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon refused to turn to look at the man; only until he saw Mance Rayder&rsquo;s expression change as well. </p><p>The leader of the Wildling&rsquo;s had also seen Y/N stand in the door. Both men worried at her reaction to the sight of the crow.</p><p>&ldquo;Little Doe is there something wrong?&rdquo;</p><p>At the sound of the name, Jon&rsquo;s head whipped to the direction of the door. Only one person other than Sansa that he knew was called Little Doe.</p><p>For the first time in two years, Y/N and Jon was in each other&rsquo;s presence. Through loss, deceit, fear, they had gone through it all and were back together again. </p><p>&ldquo;Y/N?&rdquo;</p><p>Tears sprung to her eyes at the sound of her name. She never thought she would the sound of her name so much. But she missed the man that spoke them more. </p><p>&ldquo;Jon.&rdquo;</p><p>As she cried his name, the man strode towards the woman. Jon pulling her body flushed against his own. Clinging to each other with all their strength. Pulling the other tighter and tighter. Afraid to be ripped apart once more.</p><p>Pulling back just enough to look into his eyes, Y/N spoke to Jon for the first time in a long while.</p><p>&ldquo;I came to the wall after what had happened, and I stopped to rest. But then Tormund and the Wildlings came; warned me about the dangers beyond the wall. I&rsquo;ve been here since. I&rsquo;m sorry I didn&rsquo;t save Robb and Catelyn. I&rsquo;m so sorry Jon.&rdquo;</p><p>The girl cried. The sound broke the hearts of all three men. None of the Wildlings had ever seen or heard the woman cry. They weren&rsquo;t aware of the terrors she had fled when they had found her. </p><p>Jon wiped away the tears. His hand cupping Y/N&rsquo;s face, as the other continued to hold her waist; keeping her body close. </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not your fault. You are a Baratheon, not a Lannister. You did not kill them.&rdquo;</p><p>The young woman hiccuped.</p><p>&ldquo;But I didn&rsquo;t save them either. I should have tried harder.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon held her closer, trying to sooth the woman in his arms. </p><p>&ldquo;Baratheon?&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N ceased her sobbing at the sound of Tormund&rsquo;s voice. </p><p>&ldquo;Shit.&rdquo;</p><p>Lifting her head from Jon&rsquo;s chest, she kept a firm grip of the man&rsquo;s furs, as she turned her head to where Tormund stood next to Mance Rayder. Tormund continuing to look confused, whilst Rayder&rsquo;s showed no expression. </p><p>Y/N sits down with the men and begins to explain to them her story. Of how she was meant to marry Robb Stark, the events of the Red Wedding, of all the hatred she held towards her mother and siblings. </p><p>&ldquo;I have felt more at home here and at Winterfell than I ever did in Kingslanding. The only reason I was still there was because I am the only pure born Baratheon and I was not going to leave my father. If you wish for me to leave, I will do so. But I never intended to harm you. In anyway, and I am sorry that I lied to you both, and the others.&rdquo;</p><p>Mance Rayder looked at Tormund, the man staring back. Their silent conversation being recognised by Jon as he came to sit next to Y/N. His body gravitating to sit as close as he possibly could. </p><p>The two men nodded towards the other. Looking back at the girl. </p><p>Mance Rayder spoke clearly to the woman.</p><p>&ldquo;You have shown through your words and actions that you are no Lannister. That you are no coward. That you are a Wildling. Through and through. The only way you could be more Wildling is if Tormund had birthed you himself.&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N chuckled at his words.</p><p>&ldquo;That is true.&rdquo; Tormund agreed.</p><p>&ldquo;You are one of us. That will never change.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you Rayder.&rdquo;</p><p>The man smiled at the young woman. Taking that as his leave, he stood from his seat and walked towards the entrance. </p><p>&ldquo;Snow.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon looked at the man standing at the door.</p><p>&ldquo;We shall discuss matters of you being here at a later time.&rdquo;</p><p>At the end of his words, Mance Rayder left the room, leaving the trio alone.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re still our Little Doe. Still unstoppable with a bow and arrow and a fucking great cook.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon smiled at Tormund&rsquo;s words to Y/N. He was proud that she had been able to survive so long in the game that was being played. Away from most of the carnage, but still aware of the fight. That she had been able to gain respect from a group that many people in Westeros never dared to fight against.</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you, Tormund. You are still my fire.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Aye. You better tell that to your friend.&rdquo;</p><p>Tormund left the pair alone in the tent. His laughter becoming quieter and quieter the further he travelled away.</p><p>Turning to face Y/N, Jon threaded his fingers through her hair. Wanting to feel her presence as much as he could. Cupping his hands with her own, Y/N leant into his touch. Glad to feel the familiar touch of the man before her. </p><p>&ldquo;So, tell me about the Watch? Have you finally made some friends, besides me and your family?&rdquo;</p><p>Jon chortled at her words. Y/N had always teased Jon about his lack of companions when they were growing up. As Robb and Theon grew older, they had many friends and even some women at their sides. Whereas it seemed Jon was content with only having her.</p><p>&ldquo;A young man called Samwell Tarly. He has become a great companion of mine. But all men of the Watch are brothers in arms. We have each other&rsquo;s backs.&rdquo;</p><p>A sullen look took over Y/N&rsquo;s features as she pulled her face away from Jon&rsquo;s caress. Worry instantly took over Jon at the sudden change in her demeanour.</p><p>&ldquo;And what would they make of you here with us Wildlings?&rdquo;</p><p>Jon huffed out a breath; unsure how to answer. </p><p>&ldquo;But you are not a Wildling.&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N took great offense to her friend&rsquo;s statement.</p><p>&ldquo;You heard Mance Rayder. I am a Wildling. Through and through. The only way I could be more Wildling is if Tormund had birthed me himself.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N, you are a Princess of House Baratheon and Lannister. You are meant to be in a castle, safe and away from all of this.&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N was hurt. Jon of all people should know how much she hated her life in Kingslanding.</p><p>&ldquo;You know that I have never wished to be a princess. You know that one of the reasons I travelled with father to Winterfell so often was because the horrible torment I would have faced when he had gone.&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N rose to her feet, as her anger began to take over her emotions. Jon regretting his words as soon as he said them. Y/N&rsquo;s hands slammed on the table between them. </p><p>&ldquo;You know that the place I felt safest was at Winterfell and that all went when Theon betrayed your brother. When your brother betrayed his vow. When my grandfather betrayed me. Sending men to kill us all. Your brother may have died. But I had to watch one of my best friends die at the hands of my uncle. I had to run as I knew that Cateyln, the only honest and caring woman in my life, be killed. Whilst you were in Castle Black. Having no idea of the atrocities I faced.&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N wiped her nose, as tears pricked her eyes once more. Looking away at the man in front of her. His saddened expression making her wish she wasn&rsquo;t so harsh. But she could not allow him to disrespect all she had been through.<br />&ldquo;These people took me in. They could have left me to die, whilst I searched for you, but they didn&rsquo;t. They helped me grow as a warrior. If Ygritte and Tormund did not take me in, I would most likely be on the other side of that wall, with eyes as blue as the summer sky, and skin as cold as the ice.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon flinched at her words, at the idea of her being part of the dead beyond the wall. Standing from his seat, Jon strode around the table, moving to stand in front of Y/N, forcing the woman to look at him.</p><p>&ldquo;I am sorry. They were your family as much as they were mine. I cannot imagine the feelings you have felt. But I am here now, and I am going to make sure that you are safe.&rdquo;</p><p>Looking into his eyes, Y/N searched to see any lies. She loved Jon. More than she cared to admit, but they were a part of a game much bigger than the both of them, and that meant having to question the actions of those they loved. </p><p>Stepping closer, toe to toe, Jon could feel Y/N&rsquo;s breath on his face. His eyes momentarily closing at the feeling. </p><p>&ldquo;Will I be safe in Castle Black? Among the Nightswatch? Because I don&rsquo;t think I will.</p><p>Y/N left the room, allowing her words to linger in Jon&rsquo;s heart. His chest feeling heavy at the thought of Y/N feeling unsafe with him. But he knew it wasn&rsquo;t his presence that made her feel unsafe, but that of the Nightswatch. For as far as they, and everyone else in Westeros knew, Princess Y/N Baratheon was dead. And she was. For this new woman, sitting next to Wun Wun in the open camp, was not the same Baratheon that Jon had left in Winterfell. But Jon&rsquo;s heart still thumped as hard.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-</p><p>A few days after Jon&rsquo;s arrival at the camp, Mance Rayder ordered for Tormund to escort a group of Wildlings to attack Castle Black from the rear. Instructing Tormund to have Jon accompany him.</p><p>Tormund and the Wildlings had prepared to leave camp, when out of nowhere, Y/N appeared at Tormund&rsquo;s side. Cloaked and ready for the journey ahead. </p><p>&ldquo;You are not coming Little Doe.&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N stared straight ahead, ignoring Tormund&rsquo;s words. </p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s right Y/N.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon slightly flinched at the glare she through his way.</p><p>&ldquo;I am still pissed off at you Snow. So, don&rsquo;t tell me that I would be safe at Castle Black, then tell me I cannot come with you. Because you will be proving yourself to be a liar.&rdquo;</p><p>Turning her head back forward, Y/N began to march forward with the Wildlings. Jon was frozen in his place. Staring as the woman walked at the front of the group, unafraid of what was out there. Turning his head, Jon realised that Tormund had ceased moving, much like Y/N, glaring at the man in question. Jon gulped. </p><p>&ldquo;You better start walking crow. You&rsquo;ve already pissed off one Wildling today. Don&rsquo;t make it another.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon instantly began to walk, he and Tormund quickly catching up the group; situating themselves at the front once more.</p><p>It did not take long for things to go South. With Ygritte and Jon&rsquo;s near-death experience climbing the wall, to Jon refusing to kill the innocent man, Y/N had to step in. She may have been angry with Jon. But she was not going to watch him be killed.</p><p>&ldquo;Tormund! Stop! You are not going to kill him.&rdquo;</p><p>As Y/N runs to aid Jon, Ygritte grabs her arms from behind; restraining the young woman.</p><p>&ldquo;Ygritte if you were my friend, you would let me go.&rdquo;</p><p>Ygritte held on to Y/N&rsquo;s arms tighter.</p><p>&ldquo;I am not going to let you go because you are my friend, and you will make the wrong decision.&rdquo;</p><p>Out of nowhere, Summer and Shaggydog arrive at Jon&rsquo;s side. Greywind had been kept absent from the expedition due to the treacherous climbing and walking. They could not carry supplies for twenty plus Wildlings and a direwolf.</p><p>As Jon was fighting successfully against the Wildlings, with the help of the direwolves, Y/N fought excessively hard to get out of Ygritte&rsquo;s grip. Successfully doing so and grabbing her bow and arrow as well. Holding the arrow in the direction of Tormund and Ygritte, Y/N stepped closer towards Jon.</p><p>&ldquo;You are not going to kill him!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a traitor. Still loyal to the Nightswatch.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s my family and so are you. I am not losing anymore family&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>As Y/N held back the Wildlings, with Summer at her side, Jon successfully killed Orrell. Suddenly, an eagle swooped down to attack the man, clawing him across the face. Y/N turned at the commotion, running towards Jon, she whistled, causing a horse to approach. Placing her bow onto her back she pulled out her sword, swinging it back and forth to keep away the eagle and any approaching Wildlings.</p><p>&ldquo;Get on the horse now!&rdquo;</p><p>Jon slowly climbs onto the horse. He holds out his hand for Y/N to take. Looking sadly at the man, she ignored his hand.</p><p>&ldquo;One day Jon Snow, we will see each other again.&rdquo;</p><p>Clapping the horse on the back leg, Y/N urged the stead to gallop away from the Wildlings. Jon watching as she was quickly restrained once more by the people she had called family. She had put herself in danger to save him. Jon would never forgive himself.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p><p>Y/N&rsquo;s arms were bound tightly together. Gagged to stop her screams as Tormund ordered for Ygritte and other Wildlings to chase after Jon. &nbsp;She fought and fought to free herself, but she could not fight no longer. Tormund carrying Y/N himself to their base to rest. Facing forward, he dared not to look down at the woman in his arms, hearing her soft broken cries caused his heart to replace the anger he felt at her actions to change to sadness at the sound of her tearful woes.</p><p><br />Jon cleaned his facial wounds in a small pool. His horse grazing nearby. He heard the sound of a bow being drawn, turning to see Ygritte, an arrow notched and aimed at him. Anger surges through her at the betrayal of the man. His betrayal to the Wildlings. To Y/N. Her friends.</p><p>&ldquo;Ygritte, you know I didn&rsquo;t have a choice. &nbsp;She always knew what I was. What I am. I have to go home now. I know you won&rsquo;t hurt me. Y/N wouldn&rsquo;t want you to hurt me.&rdquo;</p><p>Ygritte&rsquo;s hold on the bow began to loosen.</p><p>&ldquo;You know nothing, Jon Snow. You know nothing of what you and her family have put her through.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I do know some things. I know I love her.&rdquo;</p><p>Ygritte grunted, drawing her bow harder in rage.</p><p>&ldquo;I have loved her since we were children. I loved her when her father told her she was meant to marry my brother. I loved her when I left for the Watch. And I love her now. Through all she has been through. I love who she was and who she has become.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then why did you betray her. Why did you betray us?&rdquo;</p><p>Jon paused with his words. Staring deep into Ygritte&rsquo;s eyes, seeing the blinding rage that she held towards him.</p><p>&ldquo;I have to make things right. To make it better for her.&rdquo;</p><p>Ygritte fought back tears at the thought of Jon taking away her friend. But also, for the fact he was leaving her once more. &nbsp;Jon turned around, unaware, as Ygritte loosened an arrow into his shoulder. Jon fell to the ground, grunting in pain. &nbsp;Notching another arrow, Ygritte watched as Jon lurched up and grabbed onto his horse. She hesitated. Not wanting to hurt him more than she had. He was right. Y/N would not want her to do this. But she had to.</p><p>Jon mounted his steed as Ygritte shot an arrow into his leg; crying out as he spurred on his horse. With her anger rising once more, Ygritte shot her third and final arrow, lodging it into the crow&rsquo;s back. If he were a target, it would be right on the bullseye. Cursing as she let the man gallop away.</p><p>When Ygritte arrived back to camp, her quiver empty, but no Jon in sight, Y/N wasn&rsquo;t sure if she had successfully killed the man and left him to other creatures beyond the wall, or if she had let him go. </p><p>Y/N sat next to Tormund, arms still secured behind her back. Her face void of any emotion. Ygritte went to walk past the woman but halted as words left the princess&rsquo; mouth.</p><p>&ldquo;Did you kill him? If you were my friend, you could at least tell me that.&rdquo;</p><p>Ygritte looked at her friend, bound and sat on the floor. Like a slave. Like a prisoner. Nothing like one of their own. She hated to see her like this. But they had to be careful.</p><p>&ldquo;I did what I had to do.&rdquo;</p><p>Ygritte walked away from the woman, ignoring as her hunched shoulders went slack. Y/N no longer had the will to fight. Jon had betrayed her, the Wildlings had betrayed her, and she had betrayed them as well.</p><p>Y/N was kept detained for the time that the Wildlings prepared to invade the Black. Even though she had fought against them, Tormund and the Wildlings still cared for her. Becoming increasingly worried as she refused to speak and eat. All day and all night, she sat shackled, watching them prepare with a blank stare. Tormund could not deal with it no more. </p><p>Moving to sit next to the distant woman, Tormund dropped to the ground with a loud thud. Bringing a canter to her lips, he forced her to swallow.</p><p>&ldquo;You are not dying because of that traitor, Little Doe. I understand why you did what you did. We forgive you.&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N shook her head at his words.</p><p>&ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t. I protected him. I haven&rsquo;t seen him for years, but the moment he goes against him, I was by his side. I turned against you when I should have stopped him.&rdquo;</p><p>Tormund drank from the canter, staring into the distant hills. The air was cold, but not as harsh as it had been before.</p><p>&ldquo;But we do forgive you. People do all kinds of things for love.&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N scoffed.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t love him. Not anymore.&rdquo;</p><p>Tormund couldn&rsquo;t help but smile at the woman&rsquo;s malice filled words.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, you do Little Doe. You love him, and he loves you. Through all the changes and things that have done you wrong, you love each other. Between you, there is fire, scorching hot fire. It cannot be put out. But it can be made stronger.&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N processed Tormund&rsquo;s words. </p><p>Tormund left the woman to think. She knew of the raids that had occurred in the towns. Having been kept behind and guarded by a group of Wildlings as they had occurred. She knew that the siege of Castle Black was to occur that night. She had to prove to her Wildling family that she could be trusted. That she has always been and will be a Wildling.</p><p>Rolling onto her back, Y/N pushed herself forward, flipping onto her feet. Bending her knees to get used to the feeling of standing once more, Y/N casually strolled through the Wildlings and towards Mance Rayder and Tormund and they spoke with numerous wildlings about the battle that was about to commence.</p><p>Slowing to stand beside Tormund, she listens to the conversation. Hearing the plan of action, Y/N nods her head.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, if someone can untie me, I&rsquo;ll grab my weapons and get prepared.&rdquo;<br />Tormund jumped at the new presence, unaware of the woman at his side.</p><p>&ldquo;You are not coming.&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N turned her gaze to Mance, the man&rsquo;s steely eyes piercing her own.</p><p>Determined, Y/N easily pulled her hands free from her restraints. </p><p>Tormund looked between her hands and the girls face.</p><p>&ldquo;You could have freed yourself? You could have escaped.&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N kept her gaze on Mance Rayder.</p><p>&ldquo;But I didn&rsquo;t because I had to pay for what I did. I still do. Let me kill those bastards who changed the man I knew. The Jon I knew would never have lied of his word. He is probably dead now anyway. I will have to come to terms with that. So, Mance Rayder, please allow me to fight. To fight for the Wildlings.&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N knew he was alive. She knew Ygritte had not successfully killed him. The woman had overheard her words to Tormund. Her shots were calculated to hurt no kill. But Y/N had to, for once in her life, fight for family.</p><p>The man stayed quiet, the Wildlings around them waited for his reply, Ygritte, who was amongst the crowd, watched in anticipation. </p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N&rsquo;s determined look fell.</p><p>&ldquo;You will not fight for the Wildlings. You will fight with the Wildlings. With your family.&rdquo;</p><p>A cheer broke out amongst the camp. Y/N beamed with a smile. She was not going to disappoint them again. Not this time.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-</p><p>In Castle Black, Jon and his men prepared for the battle. Jon hoped that Y/N would not be there. That she would not fight. But he knew, that if the Wildlings had forgiven her, that he would see her right at Tormund&rsquo;s side. The battle could see the end of them both before they had even begun. <br />A horn was blown. The crows stood their stance, ready to fight. But then another horn was blown, and Jon knew, that she was there, ready to fight as well. </p><p>Swords were swung, and arrows were flown. Blood from both sides was spilled and bodies of brave men and Wildling women fell. Jon was right, Y/N never left Tormund&rsquo;s side, hacking and slashing all Nightsmen that came in their way. Taking a hit here and there, she entered the castle with Tormund, infiltrating from the inside.</p><p>Jon had just killed Styr when Ygritte had caught his attention. Her bow and arrow aimed at the Northern man. She slowly began to lower her bow.</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s inside with Tormund. Get to her.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon nodded, going to thank Ygritte, when he felt the arrow fly past. Watching as it embedded into Ygritte&rsquo;s chest. He ran to her, clutching her body as her breaths became shallow.</p><p>&ldquo;Jon Snow. Look after her. You love her, and she loves you.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon clutched Ygritte. He had made a friend in the sarcastic Wildling and he knew Y/N loved the woman as a sister.</p><p>&ldquo;No Ygritte, she needs us both. She needs you.&rdquo;</p><p>Ygritte struggled for one last breath.</p><p>&ldquo;You know nothing Jon Snow. She needs you more.&rdquo;</p><p>As the words left Ygritte&rsquo;s lips, her body went limp in Jon&rsquo;s arms. The man watched as Olly continued to fight. The bow still in his hands. Jon quickly carried Ygritte&rsquo;s body to a safe space, covering her up. Taking a breath, he turned to the castle, heading in the direction he had briefly seen Tormund run.</p><p>Tormund and Y/N were back to back, fighting off the guards that crowded them. They had heard the cheers of the Nights watch. But they were not giving up. Y/ was not giving up. Tormund had two arrows embedded into his back, and Y/N&rsquo;s left arm had taken a deep cut from one of the swords. Another scar to add to the rest. It was two Wildlings against many more crows.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s over. Let it end.&rdquo;</p><p>The pair looked to see Jon, deflated and broken. </p><p>&ldquo;This is how a man ends.&rdquo;</p><p>As Tormund raised his sword, clashing it with one of the men of the Watch, Y/N&rsquo;s eyes widened in shock as she saw Jon reach for the cross bow. Aiming for Tormund&rsquo;s leg, Jon released the arrow. The arrow hit where Jon aimed. However, it was not embedded in Tormund&rsquo;s leg, but in Y/N&rsquo;s left leg. </p><p>Jon looks on, masking in horror, walking to kick Tormund to the ground. </p><p>Y/N&rsquo;s own legs collapsed from underneath her. The pain and exhaustion taking over.</p><p>&ldquo;Put him in chains, we will question him later.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You hurt her any fucking more than you have, I will slice your throat boy.&rdquo;</p><p>Two crows did as Jon instructed. Tormund screaming as they dragged him away.</p><p>Jon turned to leave.</p><p>&ldquo;What about the girl?&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N glared at Jon. Her breaths heavy and long.</p><p>He could not risk her any harm. If he gave her leverage, then they could both be harmed.</p><p>&ldquo;Patch her up and take her to the cells.&rdquo;</p><p>Before they could grab a hold of her, Y/N pulled the arrow from her leg, throwing the object to the ground </p><p>She stood, allowing the soldiers to pull her hands behind her back.</p><p>&ldquo;Lock me away, but I a not having your filthy feathered hands touch me. I would rather bleed out. You&rsquo;ve changed Jon Snow. This game. This war. It changed all of us. Some for good and some for bad.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon gulped down the tears. Hurt from her words. </p><p>&ldquo;I SHOULD HAVE DIED WITH THEM. BUT HE SENT ME TO FIND YOU. TO BE SAFE. AND LOOK WHAT FINDING YOU DID TO ME!</p><p>Jon knew she referred to his brother and Catelyn. Even though she was being locked away, she still kept her identity a secret; knowing it would harm his position. He would have been killed for hurting her. Hurting the Baratheon princess. But she would have rather died a Wildling than lived longer as a noble.</p><p>The crows held her tighter, escorting her the same way that Tormund had been led.</p><p>Jon did not move until he could see her no more. Only then did he leave for his chambers. Preparing for the next step. Though she hated him, he was doing this all for her. He hoped that it would work.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-</p><p>Whilst laying in their cells, Tormund and Y/N had been made aware of Ygritte&rsquo;s death. Screams and cries were heard from Tormund for days on end; for his fallen family. When men walked past Y/N&rsquo;s cell, they heard silence. Only Tormund heard the quiet cries at night. His own tears erupting once more. Crying for Ygritte and for the pain they both felt. She apologised over and over, and Tormund reassured her over and over again. It was not her fault. </p><p>Jon was soon named the 998th Lord Commander. The wildlings below unaware of their leader&rsquo;s death and to position Jon was going to take of asking for their help. During their time&rsquo;s in the cells, Y/N had become dormant. Hardly eating, sleeping, talking, or doing anything at all. Detached from all that was surrounding her. </p><p>When Jon came to free Tormund and herself, to help travel and save the remaining Wildlings. Jon had unsuccessfully tried to speak to Y/N; the girl simply ignoring him as she had everyone else. They were all worried for her health. </p><p>&ldquo;She is too ill to travel.&rdquo;</p><p>Tormund glanced at the woman in the cell, debating Jon&rsquo;s words.</p><p>&ldquo;If she has to stay in this hell hole, at least get that large friend of yours to help her health.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon nodded his head. </p><p>Walking to Y/N&rsquo;s cell, Jon crouched at the gates. The woman stared blankly at the floor. She seemed lifeless, but the expanding of her chest proved otherwise.</p><p>&ldquo;I know I have changed. We both have. But I am doing this all for you. So, you can have the life you deserve. Away from all this shit that has happened. You cannot die. You did not die then, and you won&rsquo;t now. So, for once, you are staying here, and you are going to accept help. Samwell we come down to get you better and keep you company. I wish I could home you in proper chambers, but they would kill you if I did. We will be back soon.&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N slowly lifted her head as Jon spoke. Taking in his words. The two stared at each other in silence. Her eyes flickered to Tormund&rsquo;s figure.</p><p>&ldquo;Keep him safe Torm. Keep yourself safe too.&rdquo;</p><p>Tormund smiled, glad to hear his Little Doe speak again. He had missed her voice. </p><p>&ldquo;Aye,I am a Giantsbane. We will be all right. Ain&rsquo;t that right boy?&rdquo;</p><p>Jon nodded, still holding his gaze on Y/N. Even as they left the dungeons, the man never wavered his look from her. He saw her lie on the floor as they left. Falling to sleep.</p><p>Jon informed Samwell of his commands, making sure that he kept it private between the two. He did not want anyone else to question why she was having assistance. Samwell took the orders with no hesitation or question. Instantly going into action, the minute that Jon and the other Wildlings left.</p><p>Everyday Sam would force Y/N to eat and drink. Checking her wounds, bringing her fresh furs and even cleaning her own. Doing all he could to make sure she became healthy again. For a while, it was only Sam talking to fill up the silence. He spoke of his life before the watch, to his opinions on pointless things, to information of the houses. Y/N hid her amusement when he recited the history of House Baratheon to the woman. Still unaware of who she was. To him, she was a Wildling with hardly a clue of the history of the houses. Of what had occurred within the kingdoms. Or so she thought. Samwell was a smart man. Smarter than he looked.</p><p>&ldquo;Jon told me stories of when King Robert and Princess Y/N Baratheon would visit Winterfell. Of how close he was to the princess.&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N&rsquo;s ears perked up at Sam&rsquo;s words. Clearing her throat, she spoke to the young man for the first time.</p><p>&ldquo;What kind of stories?&rdquo;</p><p>To say Sam was shocked was an understatement. </p><p>&ldquo;Well, he spoke of how they met and all the trouble they caused with his brother, Robb. Of how devastated he was when he heard that King Robert and Eddard Stark had agreed for her to marry his brother. How it confirmed his reasoning of joining the watch.&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N pulled the thin blanket around her tighter. Her frame had become similar to how it was before, but she still did not fit her furs as she did before. </p><p>&ldquo;If the betrothal had not been agreed then he would have stayed in Winterfell?&rdquo;</p><p>Sam nodded.</p><p>&ldquo;Precisely.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;That bastard. He left because of Robb and I. He knew I never loved him.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I knew it.&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N froze at Sam&rsquo;s explanation. All this time she had been able to hide who she was, and this oaf had reeled it out of her.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the princess.&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N drank from the cup at her side. Placing it back down, she leaned her head on the concrete wall, turning to look at Sam, who sat on the other side of the bars. On a stool, holding his own drink.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, you going to kill me? Sell me for ransom and bribery?&rdquo;</p><p>Sam shook his head in a comical manner. The girl quirked an eyebrow. From the time he had spent tending to her, she had come to realise that Samwell&rsquo;s actions were pure. But she could not help but pull up her guard.</p><p>&ldquo;I wold never. I had my suspicions when Jon asked me to tend to you that you meant something to him. But it was not until you began to eat once more, and your face began to fill out, that I recognised your features. You look very different to your siblings yet so much like your mother and father. You have her beauty and his dark hair and eyes.&rdquo;</p><p>It had been a long time since Y/N had heard of her father or had been compared to him. She ignored the comments of her siblings and Cersei. But to hear that someone could recognise her as her father&rsquo;s child made her smile once more. <br />&ldquo;Jon asked me to look after you. And that I will. I will do anything to make Princess Y/N Baratheon better once more.&rdquo;</p><p>Sam&rsquo;s words brought tears to Y/N&rsquo;s eyes. Not of sadness or pain like she had cried for the times that have passed. But tears of gratitude. She felt for the first time, in a long time, happy to hear her name. To hear her father&rsquo;s house and her name together. Even through all she had fought, Y/N truly believed her father would have been proud.</p><p>By the time that Jon, Tormund and many of the Wildlings had returned, Y/N was better and nearly stronger than ever. Sam had successfully convinced to be placed on full time guard duty of the Wildling woman. Helping her repair and get better. Sam confided in Y/N of his desires to become a maester. The woman encouraged him to do so, reminding him to not forget about Gilly and the child he has come to love as his own.</p><p>Sam travelled to library, where Jon sat, waiting for the news of Y/N&rsquo;s condition.</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s better. She eats well, sleeps well, talks quite a lot.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon let out a small chuckle. Remembering of all the times she talked his ears off growing up.</p><p>Sam relied all of her improvements. Before mentioning his desires to leave. To become a maester. Remembering both Gilly and Y/N&rsquo;s encouraging words.</p><p>Jon stared at Sam, saying nothing.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be more use to you as a Maester. More use to everyone now that Maester Aemon&rsquo;s gone. The Citadel has the world&rsquo;s greatest library. I&rsquo;ll learn about history, strategy, healing. And other things. Things that will help when they come.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If Gilly stays here then she&rsquo;ll die. And the baby that she named after me will die. And I&rsquo;ll end up dying, too, trying to protect them. Which means that the last thing that I&rsquo;ll see in this world will be the look in her eyes when I fail them. (pause) I&rsquo;d rather see a thousand White Walkers than see that.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon inhaled and exhaled. Nodding somberly, allowing Sam to go.</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo;</p><p>The men continued to discuss Sam&rsquo;s relationship with Gilly and what it would mean for him to become a maester.</p><p>They sit in silence for a moment.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come back. You&rsquo;re not my only friend anymore. I have you and Princess Y/N to visit.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon&rsquo;s head whipped up at Sam&rsquo;s words. </p><p>&ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo;</p><p>Sam smiled faintly. </p><p>&ldquo;All the times you spoke of her, `and how you were so adamant of a particular Wildlings safety rang bells in my mind. Then when she was getting better, she looked more Baratheon every day. I asked, and she replied. Told me all that had happened since she was reported dead. Well, since your brother passed.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon looked towards the doors. Pondering on whether to leave to see her. He had been wanting to since he arrived. No doubt Tormund had already re-laid all that had happened, to her.</p><p>&ldquo;Go. She may act like she does not want to see you. But she does. She spoke the most when your name was brought up in conversation.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon stood from his seat, bringing his friend into a hug. </p><p>&ldquo;To you return.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;To my return.&rdquo;</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-<br />Jon travelled to the cells where Y/N still stayed. Without an explanation, he unlocked the door. If the rest of the Wildlings were roaming around Castle Black, so should she. </p><p>Startled at the sudden noise, Y/N sat up from her position on the ground. Watching with baited breath as Jon yanked open the metal bars. Her time in the cells, and with Samwell, had left her hours to think long and hard about how she felt. How she felt about the game. How she felt about friends. How she felt about Jon. And how she felt about herself. She did not want to become a bitter woman. Y/N knew that Jon was doing what he thought was right. He always had. The man may have caused her pain and sorrow. But he was her best friend. He was her Jon.</p><p>Jon bent down to sit near Y/N, leaning his back against the wall, he left space between them. Trying to show that he did not want to over step any boundaries. </p><p>Without a word, Y/N scooted closer to Jon, so that their arms touched. Neither moved their gazes from the wall in front of them. Slowly, Y/N laid her head on his shoulder. </p><p>The pair sat there in silence for a long period of time. Basking in the shared company. It had been the first time in years that Jon and Y/N had been able to sit together, without talking about what had happened to them or what was going to happen next.</p><p>Ever so gently, Jon placed his right hand over Y/N&rsquo;s left. Interlocking their fingers, he stroked the back of the woman&rsquo;s hand. Basking in the small pieces of affection. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;re back.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon smiled at her words. He was not sure if Sam&rsquo;s words were true. If she still cared for him.</p><p>&ldquo;So am I. You can wonder freely around the castle now. You can share my chambers, if you would like. I know you don&rsquo;t feel relatively safe amongst the other men of the Watch.&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N pondered his invitation. Snuggling closer to Jon, she tightened her hold on his hand.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah. I would appreciate that a lot Jon. Thank you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I would do anything to keep you safe.&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N tilted her head to stare into Jon&rsquo;s own eyes. Entranced by the other, their bodies moved closer together. Y/N laying practically on top of Jon.</p><p>&ldquo;And so, would I.&rdquo;</p><p>They stayed in the cells for the rest of the night. Enjoying the silence and each other&rsquo;s company. Cuddled in an embrace, Y/N and Jon fell asleep, wrapped around each other.</p><p>What they had been unaware of was little Olly slowly creeping down the cellar during their moment. Seeing his Lord Commander spread across the Wildling woman made the lads blood boil. He had lost his family, his village, his home, all to those foul monsters. And now the watch had lost their leader. A traitor. That is what Jon Snow was.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-And a traitor&rsquo;s death Jon was given. Sitting in his chambers, Y/N had left mere minutes earlier to speak to Tormund about increasing her training once more, now that she had been healed better. Jon&rsquo;s face was still flushed from the surprising kiss on the cheek from the woman. The unexpected affection causing the colour to travel across his face. </p><p>It soon disappeared when Olly quickly knocked on his chamber door, breathlessly explaining to Jon how Y/N had fallen down the steps when rushing to find Tormund. How she had heard a crack and could not move her right leg. Jon quickly left his chambers, following Olly who told him that Thorne was with the woman, who had refused any help unless Jon was there.</p><p>But what Jon had arrived to was not Y/N on the ground in pain with Thorne at her side. But Y/N held captive by Thorne; surrounded by members of the watch. The woman was gagged and shackled. The same she had been when the Wildlings lost the Battle of Castle Black.</p><p>Jon sees the woman crying. Turning to ask Thorne what the meaning of this all was, before Jon&rsquo;s words could leave his mouth, Thorne plunged a knife into his stomach. Y/N&rsquo;s screams ringing loud, even with the gag in her mouth. </p><p>With a hand on his stomach, Jon quickly manouvered to reach the woman. The loss of blood causing him to stumble. Just before he could reach her, Yarwyck, Marsh and two other black brothers proceed to stab Jon. Each dedicating their action &lsquo;For the Watch.&rsquo; Jon dropped to his knees, swaying as he watched Y/n thrash against the men who held her captive. Her gag falling loose.</p><p>&ldquo;Stop. Stop it now!&rdquo;</p><p>Thorne moved to stand behind Y/N, his dagger held tightly to her throat. When she gulped, she could feel the blade digging into her neck. </p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t hurt her. She did nothing wrong.&rdquo;</p><p>Thorne sneered at Jon.</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a Wildling. Everything she does is wrong.&rdquo;</p><p>Blood soaked Jon&rsquo;s armour. </p><p>&ldquo;She is Princess Y/N Baratheon.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I am a Wildling. Born and bred.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon looked into Y/N&rsquo;s eyes. Tears falling from both his and her own.</p><p>If he was going to die, she was not going to let him save her. She was not going to allow the title she despised to kill the man she loved and save her life.</p><p>And as Olly laid down the final blow, stabbing Jon in the heart, the last thing he saw was was Thorne, a man he had come to respect and follow, slice the blade across Y/N&rsquo;s neck. </p><p>Their bodies falling to the ground simultaneously. Neither breathing. Neither alive. The blood poring out their bodies, and down the small dips in the snow, connecting the two puddles together. Even in death, Y/N and Jon were connected.</p><p>With a sign above Jon&rsquo;s head, labelling him a traitor, and a sign above Y/N&rsquo;s labelling her a savage. The men of the watch dismembered, leaving the bodies to be found in the morning.</p><p>And as the pair lay dead, Greywind and Ghost howled to the air, alerting Davos, Edd and his men about the bodies that laid in the snow. The group quickly bringing them into their quarters, with Greywind and Ghost protecting the door. </p><p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have the numbers.&rdquo;</p><p>Edd looked at Davos in contemplation.</p><p>&ldquo;We have two direwolves.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not enough. I didn&rsquo;t know Lord Commander Snow for long, but I have to believe he wouldn&rsquo;t have wanted his friends to die for nothing. Speaking for Princess Y/N Baratheon, those men have killed an heir to the throne. Our Lord Commander&rsquo;s partner. Our friend in arms. She will not die for nothing.&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If you were planning to see tomorrow, you picked the wrong room. We all die today. I say we do our best to take Thorne with us when we go.&rdquo;</p><p>Davos began to feel frustrated at Edd&rsquo;s words.</p><p>&ldquo;We need to fight, but we don&rsquo;t need to die. Not if we have help.&rdquo;</p><p>The men in the room murmured amongst them.</p><p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s gonna help us?&rdquo; questioned one of the Nightswatch. </p><p>Davos looked across the faces in the room.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not the only ones who owe your lives to Jon Snow. Once they find out one of their own has been killed, they will come fighting and swinging. For Y/N may have been a princess, but she has a wilder family that lay closer to her heart.&rdquo;</p><p>Realisation swept over Edd. He turned to the Night&rsquo;s Watchman at his side.</p><p>&ldquo;Bolt the door. Don&rsquo;t let anyone in. I&rsquo;ll be back as soon as I can.&rdquo;</p><p>Edd exited the room. The man swiftly and quietly left the room, heading down the halls and out the castle to the man who could help them. For now, they needed the help of the Wildlings.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-Ash. All she could see was ash covering the grounds of Kingslanding. Of her home. The sound of screams and burning fire growing louder by the second. As the screams become louder, her vision started to blur. With the Red Keep in the distance falling to the ground; fire encompassing the building. Just before the darkness took over, Y/N heard a single word, over the screams and the terrifying sound of burning. As clear as day, a single word; Dracarys.</p><p>Y/N gasped as her eye&rsquo;s shot open. Taking in the cold and chilly air around her, it quickly came to Y/N&rsquo;s attention how exposed she was. Feeling a nudging of her hand, Y/N turned her head to see Greywind at the side of the pillar in which she laid. A blanket held softly between his teeth. </p><p>Slowly sitting up, Y/N took the blanket from the direwolf, wrapping it around herself securely. Her body felt extremely cold; like a corpse. How could she be alive? Jon&rsquo;s men stabbed her. Looking down to her stomach, Y/N could see the angry red scars of where her stab wounds were. The last thing she remembered, before her dream, was Olly killing Jon. </p><p>Jon? Was he alive or dead? Y/N had no idea. As she began to panic, air leaving her lungs at a rapid pace, the door of the room creaked open. Twisting her head to look at the figure, she watched as Tormund stood in the doorway in shock. </p><p>&ldquo;Tormund.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Little Doe!&rdquo;</p><p>The man rushed into the room. Coming to help Y/N as she weakly stood from the pillar. Engulfing his arms around the small woman, she went to hug him back. Until she remembered her exposed state.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m kind of naked Tormund, so I cannot really reciprocate.&rdquo;</p><p>Tormund squeezed the Baratheon princess harder before letting go.</p><p>&ldquo;It is only skin Little Doe. You are as naked as the day you were born. You should feel powerful.&rdquo;</p><p>The woman laughed.</p><p>&ldquo;I feel as though I was stabbed multiple times.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s because you were.&rdquo;</p><p>At the sound of the new voice, Y/N watched as Melisandre entered through the doors. The dark red head gracefully walked through the doors and travelled to stand next to Tormund. </p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s the witch that brought you and Jon back. I always say those kissed by fire had special powers.&rdquo;</p><p>Tormund laughed at his own words. </p><p>Y/N could not help the shock in her body. She had died and been brought back to life. But so, had Jon.</p><p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Jon? I want to see Jon.&rdquo;</p><p>Tormund ceased his laughter at Y/N&rsquo;s desperate pleas. </p><p>&ldquo;I will get him for you.&rdquo;</p><p>Tormund gave the woman another comforting hug. </p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry Little Doe. He&rsquo;s okay.&rdquo;</p><p>Releasing Y/N, Tormund headed to the door. Leaving the two women in the room alone. </p><p>Y/N felt the red witches gaze on her body. Pulling the blanket tighter around her, she felt Greywind move closer; sensing his owner&rsquo;s discomfort.</p><p>&ldquo;You hold great power.&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N looked towards the woman. Confusion written across her expression. </p><p>Melisandre stepped closer to the Baratheon.</p><p>&ldquo;Power so pure that mystic creatures will fall at your feet in awe. That even the darkest of heart will not be able to hurt.&rdquo;</p><p>The pair stared at each other in silence until the door opened once more. This time it was Jon who would walk through. </p><p>&ldquo;Y/N.&rdquo;</p><p>Hearing her name from his mouth brought tears to her eyes. The images of seeing him stabbed by the men of the watch tumbled through her mind.</p><p>&ldquo;Jon.&rdquo;</p><p>She sobbed as the man rushed through the doorway and encircled his arms around her body. </p><p>As Jon held Y/N, Melisandre exited the room. Her words hanging heavily in Y/N&rsquo;s soul. She could not think of them now. Because Jon was alive. They were both alive. </p><p>Y/N rose her arms, to encircle them around Jon, when she suddenly realised again, she was exposed. </p><p>&ldquo;Jon, I would love to reciprocate this hug, but I am naked.&rdquo;</p><p>The man instantly let go. A blush covering his entire face and neck. He turned to see a set of clothes on the chair closest to the door. Quickly grabbing them, he handed them to the woman. Turning, once again, to face away as she began to dress.</p><p>Once she was fully dressed, Y/N walked towards the Stark bastard, wrapping her arms around his torso. Spinning in her hold, placed his arms onto her waist.</p><p>&ldquo;How are you feeling?&rdquo;</p><p>The girl winced at his question.</p><p>&ldquo;Sore. Tired. Probably the same as you. How long have you been alive again for?&rdquo;</p><p>Jon looked at the ceiling, thinking of all that had happened since he had awoken. </p><p>&ldquo;A while. We thought you weren&rsquo;t going to awaken. I&rsquo;ve dealt with Olly and the men who did this to us.&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N nodded her head, silently glad she was not present for the execution. </p><p>&ldquo;And I have handed over Castle Black to Edd.&rdquo;</p><p>Now that surprised her. </p><p>Looking up at the man, she could not formulate words. </p><p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Because the Watch is not my home. We are going to take back Winterfell. Take back our home.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You, I, and Sansa.&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N placed her arms on Jon&rsquo;s shoulders, staring her friend in the eyes. </p><p>&ldquo;Sansa&rsquo;s here?&rdquo;</p><p>Jon grabbed onto Y/N&rsquo;s hand, guiding her through the halls ever so slowly. The woman still getting used to the feeling of being alive once more. Her headache slowly dissipating and her legs becoming sturdier. Turning around the corner, Jon opened a door to a dining hall. The room full of many unfamiliar faces eating, and a few familiar ones.</p><p>Jon lead Y/N to the table which seated Sansa, Tormund, Edd, Brienne, and Podrick. All of their heads turning to the commotion of the pair entering the room. Murmurs becoming louder as many men of the watch saw Y/N alive. Much like their Lord Commander, brought back from the dead for a reason.</p><p>Sansa stood from her seat at the site of the Baratheon princess. All of them being informed of what had happened to her and Jon. For the more days had passed, the more they thought she would not return.</p><p>Letting go of Jon&rsquo;s hand, Y/N embraced the young Stark woman; glad to see she had survived her tormented family.</p><p>&ldquo;I am sorry for what that cunt Joffrey did to your father; and to you.&rdquo;</p><p>Sansa grasped Y/N tighter.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay. I survived. And the moment was splendid. But I had to leave as quickly as I could. Joffrey has been the smallest of my troubles thus far.&rdquo;</p><p>Sansa pulled Y/N to sit down, with Jon moving to sit at her other side. </p><p>Y/N looked in front of her to the unfamiliar pair. However, one was more unfamiliar than the other.</p><p>&ldquo;Podrick Payne?&rdquo;</p><p>Startled, Podrick looked to the young woman. </p><p>&ldquo;Yes, m&rsquo;lady?&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N let out a cheerful laugh.</p><p>&ldquo;My god. You&rsquo;re alive. And you&rsquo;re no longer attached to my uncle&rsquo;s side. What happened?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He was trailed for treason m&rsquo;lady. For Joffrey&rsquo;s murder. He did not do it. But he did not want me to be brought down with him, so he handed me to Brienne of Tarth.&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N looked to the woman at his side. Amazement beaming in her eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;You were sworn to the kingsguard of my uncle Renly.&rdquo;</p><p>Brienne looked surprise at the amazement on the princess&rsquo; face and at her knowledge.</p><p>&ldquo;That is right m&rsquo;lady.&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N smirked at the woman.</p><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no need to be shocked. I made sure I knew everyone who was associated with my family. Even after I left Kingslanding and Winterfell. I still found my ways to know. The only reason I don&rsquo;t know now is because I died.&rdquo;</p><p>The table went awkwardly silent. </p><p>Y/N rolled her eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;Lighten up. I am alive aren&rsquo;t I. You will need to tell me everything later. I need to know it all. I am just glad that everyone here is safe. I do hope Arya, Bran and Rickon have survived as well.&rdquo;</p><p>Sansa looked towards Jon.</p><p>&ldquo;The Bolton&rsquo;s have Rickon.&rdquo;</p><p>Anger surged through Y/N&rsquo;s veins. It seemed that this war would never end. </p><p>&ldquo;We will get him back, I promise. We will get back Winterfell, we will find Bran and Arya, and we will end this war.&rdquo; </p><p>Determination laced the Baratheon&rsquo;s tone. The group startled at the woman&rsquo;s words. But slowly, one by one, they raised their glasses, ready to fight for this battle.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-<br />A battle is what they fought victoriously against Ramsay Bolton and his men. Y/N refused to stand a side; fighting on the battle field. With Podrick and Brienne having travelled to Riverrun at the command of Sansa, Y/N made sure to protect Sansa with all her might. Even escorting her to the dungeons as she unleashed the hounds onto Ramsay. Watching from the side as the man who had defiled her friend, die at the paws of his hounds. </p><p>Y/N watched on as Jon named Sansa the Lady of Winterfell. She watched on as Jon was claimed King of the North. But she refused to watch on as Jon prepared to leave for Dragonstone to meet the Khaleesi.</p><p>&ldquo;I am coming with you and that is final. My uncle is alive. He sent the letter. I want to see him, and I am not leaving you.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon raised his head to the sky, becoming quickly frustrated with the woman in front of him.</p><p>&ldquo;What happens if this goes south?&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N huffed at the man in front of her, crossing her arms.</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re in the North, wherever we go will go South. Except for Castle Black, and we&rsquo;ve only just come back from there.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon was not in the mood for her smart mouth. </p><p>The pair continued to bicker, unaware of those that watched on.</p><p>&ldquo;This sounds familiar.&rdquo;</p><p>Sansa giggled at Tormund&rsquo;s words, having heard a similar conversation occur multiple times between the pair.</p><p>&ldquo;This was my life before we left. If they were not causing trouble for each other, they were causing trouble for everyone else. Usually with Robb beside them.&rdquo;</p><p>Tormund nodded his head. </p><p>&ldquo;And he still has not admitted his love for her.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No. Neither has she for him.&rdquo;</p><p>Sansa could not help but scoff at the duo&rsquo;s ideocracy.</p><p>&ldquo;Jon I am not letting you leave again. We are both alive for a reason.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon grasped the woman&rsquo;s shoulder with his right hand. Bending his head slightly so that they were eye level.</p><p>&ldquo;And I want to keep you alive. That is why you are not coming.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Watch me.&rdquo;</p><p>Before she could even try to walk away, Y/N was yanked back by Jon. Being pulled flush against his chest as his lips slammed into her own.</p><p>Sansa and Tormund looked on in surprise.</p><p>&ldquo;We spoke too soon.&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N moved her hands to tangle into Jon&rsquo;s hair. His own hand&rsquo;s gravitating towards her lower waist. The lips locked in a passionate embrace; exerting years of pent up emotion. Love, frustration, desire, sadness, and more rolled into this one action between the pair. Their lungs begging for air as they simultaneously broke the kiss. The space between their bodies not moving an inch. Both their chests heaved for breath. Y/N biting her swollen lip as Jon&rsquo;s lust filled gaze stared into her own.</p><p>&ldquo;That was long overdue.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon chuckled at Y/N&rsquo;s words.</p><p>&ldquo;I would say so.&rdquo;</p><p>In her peripheral vision, Y/N could see Sansa smirking at the pair with Tormund at her side; a beaming smile on the man&rsquo;s face. </p><p>Shaking her head, with a smile permanently fixed, Y/N gazed at the man in front of her. </p><p>&ldquo;I am coming with you. A kiss like that gives me even more reasons to be at your side. Don&rsquo;t want you falling in love with this Dragon Queen, now do I?&rdquo;</p><p>Jon groaned, throwing his head back at the woman&rsquo;s words; continuing to over react as it caused the woman he loved to laugh.</p><p>&ldquo;Fine.&rdquo;</p><p>With her hands still in his hair, Y/N pulled his head back to her own. Their foreheads leaning on one another. </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not getting rid of me again Jon Snow.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon smiled back at Y/N.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t intend to.&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N simply smiled back.</p><p>Hopping aboard the boat with Jon and Davos, the trio prepared to set sail to Dragonstone. To meet the Queen of Dragons and to take the next step in the Game of Thrones.&nbsp;</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-<br />The trio sailed for weeks before they arrived. Y/N and Jon having become like their younger selves once more. Causing mischief for one another and for Davos. The man could not believe his eyes; seeing the Baratheon princess and the Stark bastard act so care free. He let them be, for once they would arrive to Dragonstone, all carefree antics would be out the window once more. </p><p>Looking into the crystal blue waters, Y/N breathed in the crisp see air. Jon moving to stand behind her, his hands encircling her waist as he laid his chin on her shoulder. </p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve survived this far. Do you think we will make it home?&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N&rsquo;s words were serious and deeply questioning. She wasn&rsquo;t sure herself if they would make it home. If the Queen would comply with their plan.</p><p>Jon&rsquo;s hands squeezed Y/N tighter to his chest. Her own hands raising to place over his, stroking her thumb across the rough, calloused skin. Bending his head down, Jon placed a kiss on her neck. Keeping his head in the crook of her neck as he breathed deeply in and out. He had taken accustom to doing so when he wanted to be reminded that she was here. Truly here with him. For he had imagined her touch so many times, that it took more than her hold to bring to reality that she was her; at his side.</p><p>&ldquo;I will do anything I can for us to make it home. To make it back to Winterfell.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Whether its Winterfell, Castle Black, or even further North of this world, as long as you, Greywind and Tormund are by my side, I know I will be okay.&rdquo;</p><p>The pair stared out into the ocean; allowing the silence to encompass them. </p><p>A mere few days later, the trio arrived at Dragonstone. Docking the ship at the harbour, Jon and Davos walked down the ramp of the ship to meet their awaiting company. Y/N staying on the ships a few minutes longer; making sure that all was secure for the journey home. Stood at the end of the dock was not only Y/N&rsquo;s uncle Tyrion, but Missandei and Greyworm; ready to escort the guests to their queen.</p><p>&ldquo;The bastard of Winterfell.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The dwarf of Casterly Rock.&rdquo;</p><p>Tyrion and Jon both stared at each for a moment, quickly breaking into smiles. They stepped forward and shook hands.</p><p>&ldquo;I believe we last saw each other on top of the wall.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon chuckled, remembering the moment ever so clearly.</p><p>&ldquo;You were pissing off the edge, if I remember right. You picked up some scars along the road.&rdquo;</p><p>Tyrion nodded his head in agreement.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been a long road. But we&rsquo;re both still here.&rdquo;</p><p>Turning to address Davos, Tyrion introduced himself to the gentleman.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Tyrion Lannister.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Davos Seaworth.&rdquo;</p><p>The pair shook hands in acknowledgement.</p><p>&ldquo;Ah, the Onion Knight. We fought on opposite sides at the Battle of Blackwater Bay.&rdquo;</p><p>Davos chortled.</p><p>&ldquo;Unluckily for me.&rdquo;</p><p>Moving a step backwards, Tyrion introduced Missandei to the two guests. The woman bowing her head in respect to the two men.</p><p>&ldquo;Welcome to Dragonstone. Our queen knows this is a long journey. She appreciates the effort you have made on her behalf. If you wouldn&rsquo;t mind handing over your weapons.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon looked at Davos and his men.</p><p>&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I am not giving over my weapons. No fucking way. Not whilst we are on foreign land.&rdquo;</p><p>The men and woman all turned to the sound of the new voice.</p><p>Y/N walked her way down the plank and to her accompanying men. Head held high, she situated herself to the right of Jon. Making it clear she was not letting go of her bow and arrow, or her sword. Her hand holding it tightly as it laid sheathed at her side.</p><p>Tyrion did not recognise his niece as she travelled closer to group. The face only becoming familiar once she ceased her steps, standing alongside the bastard of Winterfell. The last he had seen of her was before she and her family departed for Winterfell. Her dark brown hair long and luxurious like her mothers. She had been draped in the colours of both House Lannister and Baratheon. Now, as she stood before him, her hair laid half up and half down; slightly shorter than it had been before. Her body draped under fur upon fur; mixtures of browns, greys, and tans. She stood taller, stronger, more prepared for danger. Nothing like the innocent Baratheon he had last seen. Her face scarred from not only the Red Wedding but from the dangers she had faced whilst playing the Game of Thrones.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re alive?&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N could not help but chuckle at her uncle&rsquo;s shock. She knew her family thought of her as dead. Her where about had not been recorded since the destruction of the Red Wedding. Not until now anyways.</p><p>&ldquo;As are you uncle Tyrion. Seems we both took a hit to the face.&rdquo;</p><p>The man touched his scarred cheek, staring directly at the one that laid across the right side of Y/N&rsquo;s face. Slightly pink due to the rough wind and cold breeze.</p><p>&ldquo;Whilst you were scarred in battle, I was scarred in a massacre. At the order of my own grandfather.&rdquo;</p><p>Tyrion looked guiltily to the ground. Keeping his gaze fixed to the floor, he replied to his dearest niece.</p><p>&ldquo;I took care of him.&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N refused to drop her anger fuelled expression. She may have loved her uncle Tyrion, but to see a member of her family for the first time in so long, brought forward the repressed hatred she held towards her mother, grandfather, and other Lannister&rsquo;s involved.</p><p>&ldquo;I know. He deserved what he got. He should never have treated you the way that he did.&rdquo;</p><p>Tyrion raised his head in surprise. Staring at the woman before him.</p><p>&ldquo;He should have never called the order of the Red Wedding.&rdquo;</p><p>As the group became silence over the woman&rsquo;s malice filled words, Jon placed his hand on top of her own. Squeezing it ever so slightly; motioning that he was there for her. She squeezed back.</p><p>Missandei stepped forward, standing slightly behind Tyrion. </p><p>&ldquo;The Khaleesi wishes to speak to you all at once of your arrival. But first, your weapons please.&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N went to argue once more, only choosing not due to the look she gained from both Jon and her uncle. She felt like a teenager again. Huffing she pulled her bow and arrows from her back and unclipped her sword from her waist. Handing them over to the leader of the Unsullied.</p><p>&ldquo;You better not damage them. Wildlings don&rsquo;t have luxuries, like a Queen, to buy new weapons when one is broken.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Wildlings? I thought you were a princess?&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N smiled at Missandei&rsquo;s confusion.</p><p>&ldquo;I was a princess. Not anymore.&rdquo;</p><p>Missandei continued forward.</p><p>Davos, Y/N and Jon followed the woman on the path to where the Queen awaited. Tyrion and Greyworm trailing at the rear. </p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-Jon, Y/N and Davos approached the throne room as Dothraki guards opened the doors to allow them entrance. Coming to a halt, the group cannot help but stare at the sight of the Khaleesi, sitting highly on the intricate throne. </p><p>&ldquo;You stand in the presence of Daenerys Stormborn of House Targaryen, rightful heir to the Iron Throne, rightful Queen of the Andals and the First Men, Protector of the Seven Kingdoms, the Mother of Dragons, the Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea, The Unburnt, The Breaker of Chains.&rdquo;</p><p>At Missandei&rsquo;s words, Jon turned and looked at Davos.</p><p>&ldquo;This is Jon Snow. He&rsquo;s King in the North.&rdquo;</p><p>Tyrion could not help but smirk. Neither could his niece.</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you for traveling so far, My Lords. I hope the seas weren&rsquo;t too rough. And who may this be accompanying you both? I was only made aware of the presence of male guests.&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N resisted rolling her eyes at the Targaryen woman.</p><p>Before Davos could introduce her, Tyrion cleared his throat.</p><p>&ldquo;This is Princess Y/N of House Baratheon, my Queen. Oldest and only pure blood child of the former King Robert Baratheon of the Seven Kingdoms.&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N could not hold her tongue.</p><p>&ldquo;I was Princess of House Baratheon and Lannister, your Grace. But I am no longer.&rdquo;</p><p>Daenerys was not sure how she felt about the woman before her. Deemed a princess but refused the title.</p><p>&ldquo;Why so?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;For the Houses in which my lineage belonged have hands soaked in blood. Mostly for the wrong reasons. I choose not to be associated with such terrors.&rdquo;</p><p>Daenerys took in the woman&rsquo;s words. </p><p>She continued to speak of the former support of House Stark to the Targaryen seat of the throne. Apologising for the actions of her father and more. Offering Jon Snow the position of Warden of the North if he swore to bend the knee.</p><p>Whilst the Khaleesi spoke to the trio, images flashed in Y/N&rsquo;s mind. Segments of the dreams she had whilst Melisandre resurrected her those few months ago. &nbsp;The voice. The language. The destruction. It was her. The Khaleesi.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right. You&rsquo;re not guilty of your father&rsquo;s crime. And I&rsquo;m not beholden to my ancestor&rsquo;s vows.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon began to discuss with Daenerys about the dangers of the White Walkers and the threat the Night King held. Seeking help from the woman and her armies. </p><p>&ldquo;Did you see three dragons flying overhead when you arrived?</p><p>The torches of fire flew above them. Like in her dream. As the memories of her dreams began to take control of her attention, Y/N&rsquo;s eyes misted over. It was as though a mystic force was forcing her to view these images of what may be the future. Throughout the sounds of fire and screams, Y/N heard the faint sound of a bird. Calling in the distance. The sounds of a crown.</p><p>&ldquo;The Army of the Dead is real. The White Walkers are real. The Knight King is real. I&rsquo;ve seen them. If they get past the wall and we&rsquo;re squabbling amongst ourselves &ndash;&rdquo;</p><p>He began to walk closer to the throne.</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re finished.&rdquo;</p><p>Turning away from the Khaleesi, he faced the Baratheon woman. Concerning taking over as he saw only the white of her eyes. Her Y/E/C completely gone. </p><p>Daenerys paused. Sensing the shift in atmosphere from the Northern man.</p><p>&ldquo;I was born at Dragonstone. Not that I can remember it.&rdquo;</p><p>Standing from the throne, Daenerys began to walk towards Jon, unaware of the cause of his concern.</p><p>&ldquo;We fled before Robert&rsquo;s assassins could find us. Robert was your father&rsquo;s best friend, no? I wonder if your father knew his best friend sent assassins to murder a baby girl in her crib. Not that it matters now of course. I spent my life in foreign lands. So many men have tried to kill me. I don&rsquo;t remember all of their names. I have been sold like a brood mare. I have been chained and betrayed, raped and defiled. Do you know what kept me standing through all those years in exile? Faith. Not in any gods. Not in myths and legends. In myself. In Daenerys Targaryen. The world hadn&rsquo;t seen a dragon in centuries until my children were born. The Dothraki hadn&rsquo;t crossed the sea. Any sea.&rdquo;</p><p>She ceased her steps as she neared the man in question. </p><p>&ldquo;They did for me. I was born to rule the Seven Kingdoms. And I will.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon swivelled to face the woman. </p><p>Daenerys face fell as the colour drained from Jon&rsquo;s. Following his gaze as everyone moved to stare at frozen stance of Y/N. Her face contorted in fear and anguish.</p><p>Y/N lip began to quiver as the sound of screams and fire became too much to handle. When all of the sudden, her breaths stopped. Her lips quivered no more. While Y/N eyes were still misty, her gaze was now transfixed on the Khaleesi. Her eyebrows furrowed, and terror was still apparent across her features. </p><p>Jon moved to stand closer to the woman, worried that she could collapse at any moment. </p><p>&ldquo;Y/N?&rdquo;</p><p>Her gaze did not waver. With her eyes on the Khaleesi, and the sound of screams and fire dissipating in her mind, Y/N uttered a warning. High Valyrian leaving her tongue as though it was her mother language. The words sending a shiver of fear down the Khaleesi&rsquo;s spine.</p><p>&ldquo;Ash kessa ropagon toliot se s&#299;kuda D&#257;r&#563;ti. &nbsp;Syt lo se suvion won&rsquo;t oss&#275;nagon &#299;lva, perzys kessa.&rdquo;<br />(Ash will fall over the seven kingdoms. For if the ice won&rsquo;t kill us, fire will.)</p><p>Once the words left her mouth, Y/N breathed once more. The mist in her eyes slowly evaporated; coming back to her sense. </p><p>Shaking her head, Y/N looked around at the people in the room. Confused at why the Khaleesi and everyone else looked towards her in either worry or shock.</p><p>Locking her gaze on Jon, she grabbed his hand.</p><p>&ldquo;Are we done? Is it time to rest now because I have a large headache.&rdquo;</p><p>No one uttered any argument. Even the Khaleesi did not object, nodding to Tyrion as a sign that the conversations was over. For now.</p><p>&ldquo;Missandei, may you please show our guests to their chambers. We will continue talks on the matter shortly.&rdquo;</p><p>Tightening his hold on Y/N&rsquo;s hand, Jon could not tear his eyes away from his woman as they were escorted to their temporary chambers.</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N?&rdquo;</p><p>Continuing to walk between Jon and Davos, Y/N turned her gaze to the Onion Knight.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, Davos?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Do you speak more than one language fluently?&rdquo;</p><p>Instantly the girl replied.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes. I speak three.&rdquo;</p><p>The duo awaited her answer.</p><p>&ldquo;I speak our mother tongue, sarcasm, and Tormund.The man makes up his own words. You get used to them.&rdquo;</p><p>The two men looked towards one another. A silent conversation discussed between them. They would need to look into this matter further tomorrow. But as for then, they were all due a rest. For the weeks ahead in Dragonstone was to become some of the most active and challenging.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-During their stay in Dragonstone, Jon had convinced Daenerys to give her hand in support against the White Walkers. Gaining sufficient amounts of Dragon glass to help prepare the weaponry for the war. Since the meeting with Daenerys, Y/N&rsquo;s words were not discussed. However, the Dragon Queen kept a close eye on the Baratheon. Stunned at the woman&rsquo;s words and sudden eloquence of High Valyrian. For a woman who had denounced her title and lived amongst Wildlings, Daenerys could see she was powerful. And when Y/N interacted with the Queen&rsquo;s dragons for the first time, Daenerys could see how strong that power truly was.</p><p>Whilst Jon and Davos assisted with the mining of Dragon glass, Y/N had found much time on her hands. Becoming acquainted with her uncle once more, and even learning more about the ruling of the Khaleesi. She was clearly loved by many. Especially her dragons. </p><p>Y/N had not meant to wander as far as where the dragons were held. But she was bored. And with Jon out of the castle, there was not much she could do. Walking across the grounds she whistled to herself, shuffling her feet as she walked. All of a sudden, the harsh sounds of flapping wings could be heard. Y/N looked up to the sky, to see Drogon descend to the ground, Y/N quickly stepped back. Keeping a safe distance from the creature. He was the child of the Khaleesi, and Y/N felt that the Queen was still not particularly fond of her.</p><p>Once Drogon reached the ground, the dragon roared loudly into the sky. Y/N covered her ears at the screech; instantly beginning to panic. The Khaleesi probably was already on her way. Accusing her of harming her dragon. </p><p>&ldquo;No. No. Please stop screeching. I am not going to hurt you. Look I am really small. I have no weapons. I&rsquo;ll even take off my furs if it makes you shut the fuck up.&rdquo;</p><p>In her panic ridden words, Y/N pulled of her cloak, and carefully placed it onto the ground. The dragon sensed the woman&rsquo;s panic; stopping his roars. Drogon&rsquo;s eyes pierced into Y/N. Watching her as she stood a mere few feet away from the creature; her arms held up in surrender.</p><p>Elsewhere in the castle, Jon had arrived at the throne room, discussing with Tyrion and Daenerys about the next step in the plan; capturing a white beyond the wall. The roar from Drogon had startled them all, causing the trio to rush to the location of the noise. Greywind, Missandei, and Davos all hot on their trails as they emerged from their own locations.</p><p>But when they arrived at the heart of the noise, no one could believe their eyes. For Y/N no longer stood far away from the dragon; fear and panic taking over her features. But she stood next to the dragon&rsquo;s enormous head, stroking the creature&rsquo;s snout in a soothing matter. Rhaegal and Viserion had arrived between the time it took for the group to arrive. Each at either side of Drogon. All staring at Y/N in the same content and soothed manner.</p><p>&ldquo;One night, I hold on you<br />Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, you<br />Castamere, Castamere, Castamere, Castamere<br />A coat of gold, a coat of red<br />A lion still has claws<br />And mine are long and sharp, my Lord<br />As long and sharp as yours.&rdquo;</p><p>Daenerys slowly stepped forward. Y/N still blissfully unaware of the group.</p><p>&ldquo;What is she singing?&rdquo;</p><p>Tyrion came to stand by his Queen.</p><p>&ldquo;It is the song of House Lannister, my Queen.&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N never let her eyes drift from the dragon&rsquo;s. Resting her own head on its snout as her hand travelled to stroke the dragon&rsquo;s neck. She felt a connection with the creature. </p><p>&ldquo;And so, I speak, and so I speak<br />A girl of House of the Dear.<br />And now I weep, and now I weep<br />For the friends who are no longer here.&rdquo;</p><p>Tyrion exhaled a deep breath.</p><p>&ldquo;That my Queen&hellip; is not part of the song of House Lannister or Baratheon.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p><p>Everyone&rsquo;s gaze locked on Y/N. Surprised that she had finally acknowledged their presence.</p><p>&ldquo;It is part of me.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon held his breath at her words. Watching in sorrow as a tear not only fell from Y/N&rsquo;s eyes, but the three dragons as well. </p><p>Daenerys raged within. She was powerful indeed. If she had been able to connect with her children, moving them to tears, Daenerys would have to do all she can to keep the woman on her side. For even though Y/N did not wish for the seven kingdoms, Daenerys knew that she could still grasp it from the Targaryen&rsquo;s hands.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-<br />When the night drew in, Y/N and Jon travelled to their chambers. Aware that their days ahead would be filled with difficult decisions and extreme conditions. </p><p>Even though the pair had shared chambers throughout their travels, they still ceased to have consummated their relationship. Both feared what the physical action could change between them. They knew of their love for one another. They had died for each other and would do so again. And yet neither had uttered those words. But in a world, such as their own, change was inevitable. </p><p>Once the duo had entered their chamber, Y/N discarded of her furs once more, pulling of her boots and untucking her shirt. Jon could see that she was still emotional. It seemed her emotions from her moment with the dragons had not dissipated. </p><p>Jon would usually leave Y/N to unchanged for bed, changing in one of the large bathrooms down the hall. However, he could not seem to have it in him to leave her alone at this moment. </p><p>Y/N began to get more frustrate with herself as she tried and failed to unbuckle her sword. Jon watched as she quickly gave up the task, holding her head in her hands in frustration. She had not felt this overwhelmed since the moment Jon arrived in the Wildling&rsquo;s camp. Seeing her uncle again, the segments of dreams, her moment with the dragons, and the tension she felt from Daenerys, all became too much. Tears fell from her eyes and into her hands. </p><p>Jon&rsquo;s heart broke at the sight of Y/N crying. He had only seen her cry few times of the years they spent together. Most of which had been the last few years. He missed when times were easier, brighter, happier. When all he thought about was marrying her. He still thought about it. But this game had clouded his brain; stealing time that he could have had with her. He did not want any more time to be lost.</p><p>Walking across the room, Jon lowered to his knee in front of Y/N. Pulling her hands away from her face, Jon wiped away the tears that rolled down her cheeks. Slowly placing his lips onto her own, gently caressing his mouth across hers. He wanted her to know he was there. That he had always been there. Y/N reciprocated the gesture. Allowing her arms to travel to the man&rsquo;s hair, pulling his raven locks free from its confines. Enveloping her hands through the tresses. Jon could not help but moan at the feeling. Pulling back, he muttered the words that had always been there. But had never been said.</p><p>&ldquo;I love you, Y/N Baratheon. I loved you from the moment you arrived with your father for your annual visit when I was 12 years old. I loved you then and I love you now.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon waited for a reply. The room filled with silence. Y/N&rsquo;s hands still in his hair as she stared at the man in disbelief. Jon began to regret his decision when suddenly, Y/N began to giggle. The giggle soon turned into a boisterous laugh as a large smile overtook her face.</p><p>Jon looked on in hurt and confusion.</p><p>Seeing his confused state, Y/N pulled Jon&rsquo;s face down to her own, placing a chaste kiss onto his mouth. </p><p>&ldquo;I love you too, Jon Snow. There was a reason I did not want to marry Robb. I had another Stark in mind.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Me?&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N giggled, her right hand moving to hold Jon&rsquo;s neck. </p><p>&ldquo;No, Sansa. Yes, you. It has always been you Jon.&rdquo;</p><p>To say he was elated would be an understatement. That moment, Jon knew however this game ended, if Y/N was by his side, he could withstand the most ruthless leaders and most horrendous torture, as long as she was alive.</p><p>With the confessions of their love, the moment elevated their relationship emotionally and physically. For that night Y/N and Jon became each other&rsquo;s half. Consummating their relationship&hellip; more than once. Deep down, they had always known that they held love for each other, but they both had to grow as people; as their own individuals. </p><p>The cherished moment seemed to have sparked a light in the pair. For after that night, they refused to leave each other&rsquo;s side. Words of love and encouragement shared in intimate moments. They still caused trouble for each other as much as they did when they were younger, but now all Y/N and Jon could feel was each other&rsquo;s love. And they would both do anything to keep the other safe.</p><p>The duo and Davos soon saw their group expand. Heading to Eastwatch-by-the-Sea to capture a White Walker, they had gathered Tormund, Jorah Mormont, Gendry, Sandor Clegane, Thoros, Beric Dondarrion, and a few others along the way. With the loss of Thoros, a few other men, as well as Viserion at the hand of the Night King. Jon and his group had travelled to Kings Landing, to ask for the assistance of Queen Cersei against the White Walkers. Y/N had refused to attend. Her mother and uncle Jaime still blissfully unaware of her livelihood. She could not face her mother, after everything she had done. Not yet.</p><p>Winterfell was their next adventure. Travelling by boat with the Khaleesi and her hands, Jon wrapped his arms around Y/N&rsquo;s waist. The same as he did all those months ago when they had voyaged to Dragonstone. She turned in his hold, running her hands over the man&rsquo;s shoulders. </p><p>&ldquo;Are you ready? Ready to be back in Winterfell. With your family. With me.&rdquo; she questioned her partner.</p><p>Jon looked down at the woman in his arms.</p><p>&ldquo;I have never been so ready for anything else.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Neither have I.&rdquo;</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-Laying in the chambers that had once been his brothers, Jon turned to his side to see Y/N still fast asleep. Tired from the journey they had taken to Winterfell with the Khaleesi and her army. She had been feeling more tired in the past few weeks, blaming it on the numerous exertions beyond the wall, having to deal with Jon and Tormund every day, and her body still getting used to being alive once more.</p><p>Jon admired his beloved, wrapping his arm around the woman, pulling her to lay as near to him as possible. He watched as Greywind slowly move closer to the bed, placing his head on top of Y/N&rsquo;s stomach. Jon dismissed the action, not thinking anything of the creature&rsquo;s behaviour.</p><p>A smile overtook the man&rsquo;s face. Leaning down, he placed a chaste kiss on Y/N&rsquo;s forehead, smiling even wider when her own face broke out into a sleep filled smile. Still unconscious, Y/N reached out her hand in Jon&rsquo;s direction. Jon instantly tangling it with his own. Laying his head down to rest, Jon shut his eyes. They would both need sleep to prepare themselves for the inevitable war.</p><p>However, what both of the wild spirits failed to realise that they no longer had to keep each other safe, but also the life that was growing as they slept. Greywind nuzzled Y/N&rsquo;s stomach, hearing a small heart beat loud and clear.</p><p>For Jon may have thought to have been a bastard and Y/N a princess of House Baratheon and Lannister, but their child would be so much more. A child of the Houses Targaryen, Lannister, Baratheon, and Stark. A child of the Wildlings and rightful heir to the Iron Throne. A child of the North, South, East and West. A child that would create a new world. </p><p><br /></p><p><b>A/N- Woah, three weeks of non-stop writing as well as exams. My next piece is either going to be Podrick or Sandor Clegane.

SO, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mwv_vSZxPQeTauv5UpSpz7w\">@witch-of-letters</a> , I am sorry for the wait and I hope you all enjoy.</b></p>\n<p><b><i>Word Count- 19,891 words. Yes that is correct.</i></b></p>\n<p><b><i>Warnings- death, angst, murder, spoilers (bit late now), fluff, and everything in between.</i></b></p>\n<hr />\n<p>&ldquo;I bet you can&rsquo;t shoot an arrow through the middle of the target.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I bet I can.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Y/N Baratheon was not a girl to be challenged. Especially by Jon Snow. Her closest and dearest friend from the North. </p>\n<p>Ever since her father, King Robert Baratheon, and Ned Stark had formed an allegiance, Y/N had travelled with her father to Winterfell every month. Being the only true born Baratheon of her siblings, Y/N and her father was very close. Whilst Robert and Eddard Stark discussed important royal matters, Y/N and Jon were often causing trouble. From antagonising each other to cause mayhem, or choosing to do so on their own terms, the two together were a handful. With Robb added to the duo, the chaos greatly increased. For the trio showed no mercy with their mischief.</p>\n<p>Robb smirked at the younger duo. Leaning against the pillar, he watched on as Y/N furiously grabbed her bow and arrows. </p>\n<p>&ldquo;If you shoot the arrow through the target, you can have my portion of shank at dinner tonight.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Jon knew she would never back down the chance to have more food. Even though the Baratheon&rsquo;s was one of the strongest families in all the kingdoms, the House of Stark produced the most glorious food in the kingdoms. Food that tasted like it was made with love and from the heart. </p>\n<p>Squinting at the young bastard, Y/N nodded. </p>\n<p>&ldquo;Deal. And if I miss?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Jon looked at Robb, a smirk forming on both of their faces.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;You have to wear a dress at dinner tonight. And we mean, a dress preserved for weddings and balls; not any sort of old tat.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Y/N glared towards Robb as he spoke the conditions. Looking back at Jon, she waited to hear his opinion. </p>\n<p>The young man winked at the young woman, shrugging his shoulders as though he did not know what Robb was going to say. He did. They had agreed on her punishment earlier that morning.</p>\n<p>The young Baratheon loathed dresses. Refusing to wear them, unless for extravagant events; much to her mothers&rsquo; chagrin. She preferred to wear breeches and a tunic instead. They were more form fitting than that of a man&rsquo;s; for her mother only appeased with the clothing if it could be altered to uphold some femininity. </p>\n<p>The boys waited with baited breathes for her response.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Deal.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Cheers rang from the pair. Y/N shook Jon&rsquo;s hand. Watching as the young bastard walked towards Robb, and away from the direction of the target. And any areas around it. They were all still learning to shoot, so It was no surprise that an arrow wold stray every now and then.</p>\n<p>Taking a deep breath in, Y/N closed her eyes, slowing her breathing down. Opening her eyes, she raised her bow and arrow. Pulling the string back with necessary force, her vision zeroed in on the target. Moving her aim so that the arrow should fly straight through the centre. Taking one last inhale, she begins to release the string of the bow when-</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Y/N!&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The shout of her name caused Y/N to flinch, the arrow flying through the air. Embedding itself into the target. Just to the right of the bullseye. </p>\n<p>Y/N groaned, throwing the bow to the floor, she swivelled to the direction of the shout. Looking towards the balcony, Y/N stared at her father. </p>\n<p>&ldquo;Father look what you did. You just cost me an extra shank you knob.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Many would have been shocked to have heard how the princess spoke to the king, but it was normal. The two Baratheon&rsquo;s were not the conventional pair.</p>\n<p>King Robert chuckled heartily. With Eddard at his side, who raised an eyebrow in his son&rsquo;s direction. The two boys bowering the heads, to hide their laughter.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;All of you get ready for the banquet tonight. Robb come with me and your father. We have matters to discuss.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The three friends looked at each other in confusion. Robb shrugged his shoulders as he walked in the direction of your father and his. </p>\n<p>&ldquo;I wonder what they need him for.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Y/N walked towards Jon. The pair watching as Robb and their fathers head into the castle.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Well, you better start getting ready. Who knows how long it&rsquo;ll take to get into your dress.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Jon laughed as Y/N turned towards him, stepping so close that their breathes mingled. Leaning impossible closer to his face, Y/N glared into Jon&rsquo;s eyes. </p>\n<p>&ldquo;I may have missed the bullseye, but if that was a real man, it would have gone straight through his heart.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>At the end of her words, Y/N moved back from their proximity and walked in the direction of her chambers. Jon staring at how her hips swayed as she aggressively walked further away. </p>\n<p>Flittering his gaze between his chest and the target, he realised she was right. Shaking his head, Jon began his trek towards his own chambers. The only thought flittering through his mind was how he was one day going to marry Y/N Baratheon; bastard or not. He was going to make it a reality.</p>\n</p>",
