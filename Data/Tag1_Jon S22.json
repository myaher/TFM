            "description": "Hi there! My name is Ellie! Welcome to my tumblr! \u00a0Just thought I'd add a few things to know about me and my blog! If my url gives you any clues, at the heart of this tumblr, I'm a proud Harmony shipper through and through. And while I do still reblog HHR and Dan and Emma content (and I always will) you will find that the majority of my focus has shifted to Jonerys (Jon x Daenerys from Game of Thrones).\u00a0And while you might have to do a little deep blogging to find my reblogs on these, I also ship--both passionately and casually--Cesare x Lucrezia, Mulder x Scully, Lizzington for a while until tptb started to mess with it, Baker x Lawson (Bawson), all the Sense8 ships though Kalagang is my #1, Clint x Natasha (Clintasha), Jane x Thor (Fosterson), Darcy x Loki (Tasertricks), Darcy x Steve (Shieldshock), Kili x Tauriel (Kiliel), Superman x Wonder Woman (Superwonder), and more than I have space for or the memory to list. \nI do my best to tag every post so that if something is your notp, it's nsfw, or it's triggering, you can blacklist it. That said, if you follow me and there is something that you need tagged in order to make it a happy place for you to explore, come into my inbox and let me know :) You will also see a lot of politically charged reblogs in support of women, the queer/gender-queer and trans community, BLM, Muslims, POC, Jewish people, the mentally ill, and austistic people. I'm strongly pro choice, pro inter-sectional feminism, and refuse to call the angry cheeto currently living in the white house president. If anything like that offends you, this might not be the right blog for you.\nLast little few things to throw out there: I'm 35, I plan to adopt at least 4 cats (or more) at some point and be that cat lady everyone's always whispering about, and I tend to greet and converse with everyone I meet like an overeager puppy. \nWhew! Sorry for the long intro folks! Please enjoy your time here, and remember, you're always welcome to come in and say hi!",

Gods, she\nshould have kept him there in Winterfell, at a dungeon, and forced\nhim to stay as far as possible from his bratty self-entitled aunt,\nwhere she would be able to protect and shelter him.</p><p>\nArya\nhadn\u2019t sent her any news, but Sansa didn\u2019t expect anything from\nher. According to Bran, their sister was safe and alive, and the\nredhead knew her well enough to understand that she wouldn\u2019t be\nback before her mission was completed.</p><p>\nThe\nlady of Winterfell had started feeling better as time passed. The\nmaester had been monitoring her closely and she had lots of more\nenergy as time passed; by the time anything new arrived, Sansa was\nalready feeling fully recovered.</p><p>\nShe\nwas with Gilly that morning, walking and talking about her pregnancy.\nThe wildling girl had married Sam recently and the redhead couldn\u2019t\nhelp but think that her own pregnancy would be just as far as long as\nhers had it continued. Her stomach would be showing largely and she\u2019d\nbe so close to being a mother it hurt.</p><p>\u201cLady\nSansa,\u201d Brienne\u2019s voice called her. \u201cA letter.\u201d</p><!-- more --><p>\nHer\nwhole body went rigid for a moment.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll\ntalk to your later,\u201d she said to the Lady Tarly, quickly moving to\nmeet the woman Knight.</p><p>\u201cSeems\nurgent,\u201d Brienne explained. \u201cAll of the Lords left in here\nreceived the same one.\u201d</p><p>\nThat\nmade Sansa\u2019s heart race. Something bad had happened, she could feel\nin her very bones and blood. She almost tore the paper while trying\nto open, and although her suspicions were partially wrong, the\ncontent did nothing to calm her down.</p><p>\nIt\nwas about Jon. More specifically, about him not being a bastard, his\ntrue parents and how he was the legitimate heir of Rhaegar Targaryen\nto the Iron Throne. \n</p><p>\nBrienne\nwatched her silently, from how her face - even though still covered\nby a sharp veil of courtesy - showed a hint of worry to how her body\ntensed completely.</p><p>\n&ldquo;Please,\nsummon all of the important people we have left,&rdquo; she requested\nto the knight. &ldquo;Immediately.&rdquo;</p><p>\nNot\neven a full hour later, the great hall was a mess of shouting and\nangry men and women. The word \u2018Targaryen\u2019 was thrown around like\na curse, and Sansa was feeling like the floor had removed itself from\nher feet. It wasn\u2019t supposed to be like that, they weren\u2019t\nsupposed to learn this way. \n</p><p>\nShe\nexchanged a look with Bran. How was she supposed to calm everyone\ndown like that?</p><p>\n\u201cMy\nlords,\u201d the lady finally stood up, and the voices died slowly. \u201cMy\nlords, I believe the contents of that letter have already reached all\nof you here present.\u201d</p><p>\nThe\nroom filled up with sound again, but Sansa raised her hand before it\ncould get out of control. \n</p><p>\n\u201cI\nknow this is a shock,\u201d she continued. \u201cAll my life I heard that\nmy aunt Lyanna was a fierce woman, a she-wolf like none before.\u201d</p><p>\nShe\nchose her words wisely, using the same term people now described her\nand Arya: she-wolves. \n</p><p>\n\u201cShe\nwasn\u2019t kidnapped, but went on her own journey and gave birth to a\nson. Jon. She gave him her own life and made sure that he\u2019d be\nraised here in the North, because she knew who he would one day\nbecome.\u201d</p><p>\nShe\nhoped she was making sense; gods be good, this was too much. The only\npeople who knew about Jon\u2019s secret before were the Starks, Samwell\nTarly and his wife; Jon had told Arya before leaving for King\u2019s\nLanding and Samwell and Bran were the ones who had found out about\nthe secret. Now the whole North knew, and the rest of Westeros just\nas well; and if they all knew it, then the Targaryen queen also knew\nit, and Sansa was afraid of what she could do with the information in\nhands. \n</p><p>\n\u201cI\ntrust Jon Snow with my life,\u201d Sansa said in a strong voice. \u201cI\ndon\u2019t care about his name. He\u2019s the same man who was by my side\nwhen we retrieved the North from the Bolton and prepared ourselves\nfor Winter, the same man who united the people of the seven kingdoms\nand the wildlings and who would do anything in his reach to protect\nus from harm.\u201d</p><p>\n.\n. .</p><p>\nThat\nhad calmed the Lords for a time, but not for long. She had had to\npack and leave to King\u2019s Landing the very next day, representing\nboth the Starks and their families. Sansa had promised herself she\u2019d\nnever, ever step foot into that city again after the years of pain\nand torture, but the letter was from Jon, and she knew she had to go.\n\n</p><p>The\nplace was destroyed; it looked nothing like what had Sansa\nremembered. The stone streets that used to be filled with people\nlooked like a snow desert - but she knew they were covered in <i>ashes</i>\n-\nthe Great Sept of Baelor, where she had been forcefully married to\nTyrion Lannister years and years ago, didn\u2019t exist anymore and was\nreplaced by a hole in the ground of the hill. The people\u2026 They\nweren\u2019t a lot of people, and even less of them were out to watch\nthem arrive. \n</p><p>\nThings\nhad happened too fast after the letter about Jon\u2019s true identity;\nThe Dragon Queen had finally revealed her true face and burnt\nhundreds of thousands of innocent people with dragon fire, and\npilling from the Unsullied and Dothraki did the rest of the trick.\nShe had burnt Cersei\u2019s body to the bone even after finding her\nalready dead with Jaime by her side, her throat cut and his heart\nstabbed in what seemed to have been a suicide mission. \n</p><p>What\nhappened next left everyone more than shocked - even more so than\nwhat the Queen had done -, and her own Knight, Sir Jorah the Andal,\nhad ended her life with a sword to her chest. He\u2019d surrendered\nhimself to the leader of the Unsullied right after, not even afraid\nof collecting the results of his actions. He loved her, Sansa knew.\n<i>The\nthings we do for love.</i></p><p>\nShe\nwasn\u2019t a stranger to love sacrifices. \n</p><p>\nShe\nleft the wheelhouse with the coldest look on her face. It felt like a\ncold summer day in Winterfell in the capital, and it sounded just as\nsilent when she entered the dragon pit and sat down where a chair had\nbeen reserved for the Lady of Winterfell. Arya was right behind her,\nstanding beside Brienne as in a way of protecting her from whatever\ncould come from those people. The biggest houses were represented in\nthe middle of the pit, but there were hundreds of smaller lords\ntaking space in the bleachers. This reunion would decide who would\noccupy the seat Cersei\u2019s death left as Queen. \n</p><p>\nSansa,\nhowever, wasn\u2019t there for it. She had a mission, set upon her by\nherself and for her people. She\u2019d declare the North independent and\nleave those Southerners to their own politics. \n</p><p>\nJon\nsat down by her side, and the Grandmaester selected by the Citadel\nwas the one to explain to them what about to happen right before\ngiving them the opportunity to say anything that would be relevant at\nthat moment, and Sansa knew this was her one and only opportunity.</p><p>\nThe\nthree Starks exchanged looks and Sansa put herself on her feet. \n</p><p>\n\u201cMy\nlords,\u201d she looked around. \u201cThe times Westeros faces now are of\nchange. Our people have suffered and our lands have suffered since\nthe death of King Robert Baratheon.

Her stomach would be showing largely and she\u2019d\nbe so close to being a mother it hurt.</p><p>\u201cLady\nSansa,\u201d Brienne\u2019s voice called her. \u201cA letter.\u201d</p>[[MORE]]<p>\nHer\nwhole body went rigid for a moment.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll\ntalk to your later,\u201d she said to the Lady Tarly, quickly moving to\nmeet the woman Knight.</p><p>\u201cSeems\nurgent,\u201d Brienne explained. \u201cAll of the Lords left in here\nreceived the same one.\u201d</p><p>\nThat\nmade Sansa\u2019s heart race. Something bad had happened, she could feel\nin her very bones and blood. She almost tore the paper while trying\nto open, and although her suspicions were partially wrong, the\ncontent did nothing to calm her down.</p><p>\nIt\nwas about Jon. More specifically, about him not being a bastard, his\ntrue parents and how he was the legitimate heir of Rhaegar Targaryen\nto the Iron Throne. \n</p><p>\nBrienne\nwatched her silently, from how her face - even though still covered\nby a sharp veil of courtesy - showed a hint of worry to how her body\ntensed completely.</p><p>\n\u201cPlease,\nsummon all of the important people we have left,\u201d she requested\nto the knight. \u201cImmediately.\u201d</p><p>\nNot\neven a full hour later, the great hall was a mess of shouting and\nangry men and women. The word \u2018Targaryen\u2019 was thrown around like\na curse, and Sansa was feeling like the floor had removed itself from\nher feet. It wasn\u2019t supposed to be like that, they weren\u2019t\nsupposed to learn this way. \n</p><p>\nShe\nexchanged a look with Bran. How was she supposed to calm everyone\ndown like that?</p><p>\n\u201cMy\nlords,\u201d the lady finally stood up, and the voices died slowly. \u201cMy\nlords, I believe the contents of that letter have already reached all\nof you here present.\u201d</p><p>\nThe\nroom filled up with sound again, but Sansa raised her hand before it\ncould get out of control. \n</p><p>\n\u201cI\nknow this is a shock,\u201d she continued. \u201cAll my life I heard that\nmy aunt Lyanna was a fierce woman, a she-wolf like none before.\u201d</p><p>\nShe\nchose her words wisely, using the same term people now described her\nand Arya: she-wolves. \n</p><p>\n\u201cShe\nwasn\u2019t kidnapped, but went on her own journey and gave birth to a\nson. Jon. She gave him her own life and made sure that he\u2019d be\nraised here in the North, because she knew who he would one day\nbecome.\u201d</p><p>\nShe\nhoped she was making sense; gods be good, this was too much. The only\npeople who knew about Jon\u2019s secret before were the Starks, Samwell\nTarly and his wife; Jon had told Arya before leaving for King\u2019s\nLanding and Samwell and Bran were the ones who had found out about\nthe secret. Now the whole North knew, and the rest of Westeros just\nas well; and if they all knew it, then the Targaryen queen also knew\nit, and Sansa was afraid of what she could do with the information in\nhands. \n</p><p>\n\u201cI\ntrust Jon Snow with my life,\u201d Sansa said in a strong voice. \u201cI\ndon\u2019t care about his name. He\u2019s the same man who was by my side\nwhen we retrieved the North from the Bolton and prepared ourselves\nfor Winter, the same man who united the people of the seven kingdoms\nand the wildlings and who would do anything in his reach to protect\nus from harm.\u201d</p><p>\n.\n. .</p><p>\nThat\nhad calmed the Lords for a time, but not for long. She had had to\npack and leave to King\u2019s Landing the very next day, representing\nboth the Starks and their families. Sansa had promised herself she\u2019d\nnever, ever step foot into that city again after the years of pain\nand torture, but the letter was from Jon, and she knew she had to go.\n\n</p><p>The\nplace was destroyed; it looked nothing like what had Sansa\nremembered. The stone streets that used to be filled with people\nlooked like a snow desert - but she knew they were covered in <i>ashes</i>\n-\nthe Great Sept of Baelor, where she had been forcefully married to\nTyrion Lannister years and years ago, didn\u2019t exist anymore and was\nreplaced by a hole in the ground of the hill. The people\u2026 They\nweren\u2019t a lot of people, and even less of them were out to watch\nthem arrive. \n</p><p>\nThings\nhad happened too fast after the letter about Jon\u2019s true identity;\nThe Dragon Queen had finally revealed her true face and burnt\nhundreds of thousands of innocent people with dragon fire, and\npilling from the Unsullied and Dothraki did the rest of the trick.\nShe had burnt Cersei\u2019s body to the bone even after finding her\nalready dead with Jaime by her side, her throat cut and his heart\nstabbed in what seemed to have been a suicide mission. \n</p><p>What\nhappened next left everyone more than shocked - even more so than\nwhat the Queen had done -, and her own Knight, Sir Jorah the Andal,\nhad ended her life with a sword to her chest. He\u2019d surrendered\nhimself to the leader of the Unsullied right after, not even afraid\nof collecting the results of his actions. He loved her, Sansa knew.\n<i>The\nthings we do for love.</i></p><p>\nShe\nwasn\u2019t a stranger to love sacrifices. \n</p><p>\nShe\nleft the wheelhouse with the coldest look on her face. It felt like a\ncold summer day in Winterfell in the capital, and it sounded just as\nsilent when she entered the dragon pit and sat down where a chair had\nbeen reserved for the Lady of Winterfell. Arya was right behind her,\nstanding beside Brienne as in a way of protecting her from whatever\ncould come from those people. The biggest houses were represented in\nthe middle of the pit, but there were hundreds of smaller lords\ntaking space in the bleachers. This reunion would decide who would\noccupy the seat Cersei\u2019s death left as Queen. \n</p><p>\nSansa,\nhowever, wasn\u2019t there for it. She had a mission, set upon her by\nherself and for her people. She\u2019d declare the North independent and\nleave those Southerners to their own politics. \n</p><p>\nJon\nsat down by her side, and the Grandmaester selected by the Citadel\nwas the one to explain to them what about to happen right before\ngiving them the opportunity to say anything that would be relevant at\nthat moment, and Sansa knew this was her one and only opportunity.</p><p>\nThe\nthree Starks exchanged looks and Sansa put herself on her feet. \n</p><p>\n\u201cMy\nlords,\u201d she looked around. \u201cThe times Westeros faces now are of\nchange. Our people have suffered and our lands have suffered since\nthe death of King Robert Baratheon. Joffrey was a stupid and cruel\nKing, a child spoiled rotten, honestly,\u201d Sansa tried not to shudder\nwith the memories crossing her mind. \u201cTommen was used by his\ngrandfather, then his mother, then his wife, then the faith and died\nlike a no one.\u201d</p><p>\nSansa\nheard as the lords agreed along with her, and felt as her heart\nfilled up with more confidence. \n</p><p>\n\u201cCersei\ndidn\u2019t care about anyone other than herself and every single one of\nus suffered because of this,\u201d she continued. \u201cAnd Daenerys\u2026\nWell\u2026 I don\u2019t have to say anything about Daenerys, do I?\u201d</p><p>\nJon\nlowered his head, perhaps embarrassed, but she didn\u2019t give him more\nthan a few seconds of attention. \n</p><p>\n\u201cThe\nNorth was in ruins because of them, but we fought and we conquered\nsomething that we won\u2019t give away. We are an independent Kingdom\nnow. We are open to business and diplomacy like we always were, and\nyou can count on our help in the occasions you need.
