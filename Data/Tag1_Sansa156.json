Initially I loved d\u2019s \ud83d\udc69\ud83c\udffb\u200d\ud83e\uddb3character I didn\u2019t ship her with anyone really I didn\u2019t even mourn drogos death I was kinda relieved for her. I never thought I would ship her with Jon I never thought I would ship Sansa with Jon. I was just minding my own business watching a show that had awesome stories that were complex and that\u2019s it. AND THEN IT HAPPENED. Sansa \ud83d\udc69\ud83c\udffb\u200d\ud83e\uddb0went to castle \ud83c\udff0 black because Jon \ud83e\uddd4\ud83c\udffb was there  and then the epic hug \ud83d\ude12 ok that was a tear jerker I mean they never even shared a scene together but they are both coming out of traumatic experiences. I was so happy for them and it was a breath of fresh air and it was super emotional. Wow look at them they look so happy and comfortable wow \ud83d\ude2f the chemistry is thick  they are brother and sister right. Right!? \ud83e\uddd0\ud83d\ude0f ok we are entering some taboo territory here. But here\u2019s the kicker it never felt weird. I wanted them together now. I loved the angst I loved them going back and forth. I loved that they were getting a feel for one another and building that trust. It was beautiful to watch and then u have the parentage reveal and it\u2019s oh so sweet because these dorks don\u2019t see it coming but we do or at least some of us do. Some folks choose to look over all this and jump for D but there\u2019s a reason all of this happened before he met her. Every interaction we see with Jon and D is now compared to Jon and Sansa and it just can\u2019t come close. Even a bloody boat bang couldn\u2019t hurt my jonsa feelings because it felt empty it felt like sex \u201cblandcest\u201d to be exact. Credit to the jonsa that came up with that term because I absolutely love it. It describes boat bang accurately. For the record I started watching GOT after coming across sansan gifs here on tumblr and I expected to love Sansa but that first season I disliked her and loved D. So that\u2019s the story glory. Sansa Stark is the most under appreciated character on GOT and its baffling. She is the hero. She played a crucial part in bringing down ramsay and LF. I mean how could u just ignore that. Any who sucks to be all y\u2019all missing half the story here but it\u2019s ur loss. I was with D up until dragonstone. Something changed and then the tarlys happened and I just couldn\u2019t anymore and I couldn\u2019t want Jon to be with someone I couldn\u2019t root for. Yet I love my dragons \ud83d\udc09 \ud83d\udc09 \ud83d\udc09 I love their scenes. They truly do stir up awe and amazement. I know they are dangerous but I love them still. What rubs me the wrong way is you call them your children cause I feel like they are mine too but u are using them to gain a kingdom u feel entitled too. So u will put them in harms way to get what u want. I don\u2019t know this doesn\u2019t sit right with me. Every time she says they are her children I side eye that because you don\u2019t treat them like it and it sounds hypocritical. Actions speak louder than words and what I hear her say and what I see her do is two different things. This is my reasoning for not following her. My moral compass and heart just couldn\u2019t. So I didn\u2019t just dislike her because she was messing with my ship. She is a morally flawed character but a lot of folks are ride or die and that\u2019s ok. </p>",
