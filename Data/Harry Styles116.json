I\u2019m a little in shock at how much people loved <a href=\"http://waitingfortwilight.tumblr.com/post/182294868714/sit-down\">Sit Down</a>, and I know a few people asked for a part 2, SO I DID! I have to say a massive thank you to <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mEc9z2eqUqRfZQSKVCVt7fg\">@pendantstyles</a> for sharing my original post, Hannah is incredible and I love her \u2764\ufe0f please let me know if you like it!!!!!!!</i></b></p><p>~~~</p><p>You actually can\u2019t remember the last time you felt so\u2026 <i>floaty?</i> It\u2019s been just over a week since Harry apologised to you that Monday night in the kitchen after an argument over a bowl of soup, and he\u2019s acting weirder than ever now. You still weren\u2019t entirely yourself, and you hate to blame other people but you have to hold Harry partly responsible for your glumness.</p><p>Your relationship had gone from one extreme to the other; instead of being completely ignored and barely seeing him, he now absolutely would not leave you alone. He was working himself around you now, doing his best to be by your side at every opportunity.\u00a0</p><!-- more --><p>Sure, it was nice on days one and two, feeling like you finally had your fianc\u00e9 back after an impossible amount of time and actually starting to feel loved again. He\u2019s there in the morning when you get up, he takes you to work and making desperately sure to give you a kiss before you get out of his car. And then he\u2019s there when you finish to take you home again, always wearing a ridiculous smile that does make you laugh because he is just a bit ridiculous, isn\u2019t he?</p><p>For the first time in months Harry actually holds you as you sleep, his arms permanently wrapped around your middle the entire night. You\u2019re quite wriggly in bed, always have been and undoubtedly always will be, and he\u2019s even ignored that because he\u2019s absolutely damned if you\u2019re going anywhere.</p><p>You\u2019d actually been reminded of an advert you\u2019d seen on the telly recently; your mattress is getting old and your relationship is growing tired. You\u2019re separating emotionally and also physically which <i>must mean</i> it\u2019s time for a new mattress. You get your new mattress and miraculously your love for one another has re-blossomed. Except on this occasion you still have that same mattress and your fianc\u00e9 has actually just stopped being a twat. For now anyway.</p><p>The problem was you didn\u2019t want Harry to be at your side every single minute of every single day. You just wanted it to go back to normal, how it had been when you got engaged. You were both incapable of being subtle about your feelings for one another but at the same time what you were doing together felt natural. Now everything feels forced, and you feel - and you really, <i>really</i> hate to admit it - suffocated.</p><p>Harry\u2019s constant attention is pulling your mind from itself, it was like you were watching yourself from another person\u2019s eyes. Like you were in subspace without the sex part. Like you were having an out of body experience. You just still weren\u2019t you.</p><p>You had no idea of Harry\u2019s concerns for you. He\u2019d paid attention to everything you did. He noticed the moment you got home you crashed on the sofa rather than immediately making dinner. Noticed the bags under your eyes from your exhaustion, and noticed your resignation from <i>any</i> task your were encumbered with.</p><p>Of the eight nights he\u2019s been secretly observing you, four of those you\u2019ve had a drink before bed. Two of them had been on days when you didn\u2019t have to work the next day, and the other two you\u2019d come home in a foul mood after a shit day. You\u2019d made love each of those four nights, and you don\u2019t like to brag but\u2026 <i>damn.</i></p><p>Much to your confusion he\u2019d visited your mum\u2019s with you that week. You\u2019d always go on a Sunday evening because she always seems to have plans literally every other day of the week. Harry didn\u2019t usually come with you, but for reasons unbeknownst to you he did this week, and your mum was over the moon.</p><p><i>\u201cOh!\u201d</i> She\u2019d beamed between the both of you in absolute delight.<i> \u201cLet\u2019s open a bottle since Harry\u2019s finally decided to show his face again!\u201d </i>It hadn\u2019t been a dig at Harry, more a notion that he never accompanied you on your weekly visit and it was nice to see his face again.</p><p>You failed to notice the relief wash over Harry\u2019s face at your decline to her offer of a drink. Why would you think anything of it anyway? You\u2019re not one to indulge your mother\u2019s ignorance towards her very obvious problem.</p><p>Up to this point you hadn\u2019t actually had a drink for three or four days. You\u2019d adopted a migraine a few days back just after you\u2019d visited your mum and had really been feeling it ever since. It no doubt developed after you\u2019d neglected to wear your glasses for all of about ten minutes at work, and you were really being punished for your stupidity.</p><p>The throbbing behind your eyes had begun to cause temporary blind spots in your vision, and for the first time in a week you were grateful for Harry\u2019s ongoing chauffeur service.</p><p>As you stand waiting for him by the back door of your work where he usually collects you, you don\u2019t notice the fact that you\u2019re all but glaring at the floor, frowning and squinting your eyes to try and relieve the pain. It\u2019s too bright outside; you can barely handle keeping your eyes open even a fraction because the sun is far too <i>shiny</i> for your liking today.</p><p>Because you\u2019re too busy insulting the pavement underneath you just with your face, you fail to notice Harry pull up mere inches in front of you. The fact that you\u2019re spending too much time thinking about how much your head hurts is only making it hurt <i>more</i>, and now you\u2019re just feeling pitiful at yourself.</p><p>Harry calling your name pulls you from your bubble of grumpiness, and your head snaps up to see his car literally right there in front of you. You can\u2019t quite believe that you actually managed to miss the huge thing approach you, and you internally scold yourself for being so fucking dramatic.</p><p>You blink at him wide eyed a couple of times and scramble into the passenger seat blindly, the white spots in your vision seemingly merging into one so that you really can\u2019t see much at all.</p><p>Harry\u2019s watching you awkwardly blink ahead of you as you pull your seatbelt on, and at first he finds it slightly amusing. But when you don\u2019t say anything at all and fall sideways so that your head is resting on the window, and your hand covers your eyes to block any further light getting in, he\u2019s concerned again. \u201cYou alright, love?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh uh.\u201d You mumble with a very gentle shake of your head. You\u2019re scared that talking might aggravate the throbbing further.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d Harry\u2019s throat is thick and tight, and he\u2019s now put the car into neutral so that he can angle himself towards you properly. He can see you\u2019re not well just from the even darker circles under your eyes and the fact that you\u2019re much, much paler in complexion than usual.</p><p>You take a deep breath, the pain in your head spiking from his words even though they were softer than you think you\u2019ve ever heard him speak. \u201cHead hurts.\u201d You whisper, and it\u2019s almost a whimper because you feel your cries threatening in your chest and your tears burning your eyes.</p><p>You\u2019ve been with Harry long enough for him to know that your migraines are common, but he\u2019s never seen one as bad as this. \u201cOkay,\u201d he breathes slowly, his releasing breath a little shaky with his concern for you, \u201clet\u2019s get you home and to bed.\u201d He takes your hand in his and brings it to his lips. He holds it the entire way home, only releasing it to change gear or indicate.</p><p>Regardless of your feelings of suffocation, you can\u2019t deny that you\u2019re grateful that Harry is still here and with you. You can\u2019t imagine doing this with anyone else. As much as you\u2019ve argued you\u2019re glad that it\u2019s him you\u2019re arguing with. As much as you\u2019ve struggled you\u2019re glad that it\u2019s him you\u2019re struggling with. Relationships are not just a walk in the park.</p><p>Harry throws you cautious glances every so often, but you never see them because your eyes remain closed until he\u2019s pulled onto the driveway. He\u2019s careful with you, helping you out of the car slowly since your sight is still temporarily\u2026 well, blank. He opens the door for you, and all but carries you upstairs to bed as his hands are holding your waist to make sure you don\u2019t fall.</p><p>You strip out your work clothes slowly, still frowning mostly at the floor as you do so. You pull on a t-shirt that Harry had left draped over the back of the chair as he gets you a glass of water. You\u2019ve drank more than enough water today but you still feel dehydrated and had no trouble downing the entire pint in less than a minute.</p><p>\u201cGood girl.\u201d Harry mumbles his praise quietly, and places a soft kiss to your forehead before disappearing to replace it.</p><p>When he returns you\u2019re already settled under the covers but your arms are crossed over your eyes to avoid the light flooding the room. Harry makes it his next task to cover the windows to block out the harsh sunlight, not even leaving a lamp on just in case.</p><p>\u201cGo to sleep, angel.\u201d He whispers to you, his hand caressing your stomach under your t-shirt as he leans down to place an ever so gentle kiss to your lips. \u201cI\u2019ll just be downstairs if you need me, alright?\u201d</p><p>You frown at his words and at the fact that he\u2019s already making a move for the door. You don\u2019t want him to leave you. Not yet anyway. \u201cWait,\u201d you sit up and call after him, though the sound is quiet as a mouse, \u201ccan you just\u2026 can y\u2019just lie with me a minute?\u201d</p><p>Harry turns back to you with a small smile, but even through your partial vision you can see in his eyes that he\u2019s elated you\u2019ve asked him. \u201cCourse I can, love.\u201d He hums, and soon enough he\u2019s crawling into bed beside you, tucking you into his side and nuzzling his nose into your hair.</p><p>This is the closest you\u2019ve felt to him for the longest time, all the tension the two of you have had seems to disappear, because right in this moment all that matters is that he cares about you and you care about him.</p><p>You\u2019re not sure whether it\u2019s your migraine, Harry\u2019s intoxicating smell or your exhaustion, but it only takes a matter of minutes for sleep to consume you, and you\u2019re finally slipping into the far corners of your dreams.</p><p>\u00ac</p><p>It\u2019s dark when you wake again. You\u2019re not sure of the time, but Harry is still holding you except he\u2019s moved you to lie between his legs. The tv is on and at its lowest possible volume, and you can tell that Harry\u2019s adjusted the brightness on it because it\u2019s usually a lot brighter than that.</p><p>You shift your position ever so slightly, and you feel Harry\u2019s arms tighten around you. You focus on the tv to adjust your vision, sitting up slowly and rubbing your eyes. Your migraine appears to have settled, though maybe not entirely as you can still feel a gentle ache in your left temple. <i>At least you can fucking see now though, right?</i></p><p>\u201cFeeling better?\u201d Harry asks quietly, his hand moving up to the side of your face to stroke your cheek. He\u2019d told you once your cheeks were magnificent, you\u2019ve never quite understood it.</p><p>You turn your head towards him and give him a small nod with a gentle smile. You notice that he looks extra pretty today. His curls are extra curly, and the warm light of the tv is giving him a sort of strange red hew. Even now his green eyes are piercing, and you hate how much you fucking love them. How much you fucking love him. You\u2019ve told him before to stop being so pretty because it\u2019s not fair on everyone else. What does he do in those circumstances? <i>Laugh</i>. Narcissist.</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d your words catch in your throat from sleep, so you clear your voice before speaking again, \u201cmuch better.\u201d</p><p>Harry\u2019s lips pull at the corners, and his eyes wrinkle at the beginnings of a smile. Any bigger and his dimples would threaten, and you\u2019d burst into tears because they\u2019re just so stupidly pretty all on their own. He reaches to the bedside table to hand you the water he\u2019d left for you earlier, and once again its gone in no time at all. \u201cAre you hungry?\u201d</p><p>His question has you listening to your stomach. The honest answer was no; you weren\u2019t hungry. But you knew Harry too well by this point that it was a rhetorical question and he was actually asking you what you want to eat. You didn\u2019t know that either. \u201cUm, not right now but I probably will be in like an hour.\u201d</p><p>Your answer seems to pacify him, though you can already guess what his next words will be. \u201cHopefully by the time dinner\u2019s ready you\u2019ll be hungry then.\u201d He raises his brows at you suggestively, smile widening to finally set those fucking dimples you\u2019ve been desperate to avoid.</p><p>\u201cYeah maybe.\u201d Is all you can fathom, and you frown at him in bewilderment but you\u2019re basically smiling through it anyway.</p><p>You\u2019re not that couple who dance and sing in the kitchen any more. You\u2019re also not the couple who stare at each other longingly from across the room at public events. You\u2019re not the couple who force your love for other people to see to prove a point, and you\u2019re not the couple who have completely fallen out of love either.</p><p>No, you\u2019re the couple that even after a tough time with one another managed to pull through and come out at the end of it still in love.

He\u2019s there in the morning when you get up, he takes you to work and making desperately sure to give you a kiss before you get out of his car. And then he\u2019s there when you finish to take you home again, always wearing a ridiculous smile that does make you laugh because he is just a bit ridiculous, isn\u2019t he?</p><p>For the first time in months Harry actually holds you as you sleep, his arms permanently wrapped around your middle the entire night. You\u2019re quite wriggly in bed, always have been and undoubtedly always will be, and he\u2019s even ignored that because he\u2019s absolutely damned if you\u2019re going anywhere.</p><p>You\u2019d actually been reminded of an advert you\u2019d seen on the telly recently; your mattress is getting old and your relationship is growing tired. You\u2019re separating emotionally and also physically which <i>must mean</i> it\u2019s time for a new mattress. You get your new mattress and miraculously your love for one another has re-blossomed. Except on this occasion you still have that same mattress and your fianc\u00e9 has actually just stopped being a twat. For now anyway.</p><p>The problem was you didn\u2019t want Harry to be at your side every single minute of every single day. You just wanted it to go back to normal, how it had been when you got engaged. You were both incapable of being subtle about your feelings for one another but at the same time what you were doing together felt natural. Now everything feels forced, and you feel - and you really, <i>really</i> hate to admit it - suffocated.</p><p>Harry\u2019s constant attention is pulling your mind from itself, it was like you were watching yourself from another person\u2019s eyes. Like you were in subspace without the sex part. Like you were having an out of body experience. You just still weren\u2019t you.</p><p>You had no idea of Harry\u2019s concerns for you. He\u2019d paid attention to everything you did. He noticed the moment you got home you crashed on the sofa rather than immediately making dinner. Noticed the bags under your eyes from your exhaustion, and noticed your resignation from <i>any</i> task your were encumbered with.</p><p>Of the eight nights he\u2019s been secretly observing you, four of those you\u2019ve had a drink before bed. Two of them had been on days when you didn\u2019t have to work the next day, and the other two you\u2019d come home in a foul mood after a shit day. You\u2019d made love each of those four nights, and you don\u2019t like to brag but\u2026 <i>damn.</i></p><p>Much to your confusion he\u2019d visited your mum\u2019s with you that week. You\u2019d always go on a Sunday evening because she always seems to have plans literally every other day of the week. Harry didn\u2019t usually come with you, but for reasons unbeknownst to you he did this week, and your mum was over the moon.</p><p><i>\u201cOh!\u201d</i> She\u2019d beamed between the both of you in absolute delight.<i> \u201cLet\u2019s open a bottle since Harry\u2019s finally decided to show his face again!\u201d </i>It hadn\u2019t been a dig at Harry, more a notion that he never accompanied you on your weekly visit and it was nice to see his face again.</p><p>You failed to notice the relief wash over Harry\u2019s face at your decline to her offer of a drink. Why would you think anything of it anyway? You\u2019re not one to indulge your mother\u2019s ignorance towards her very obvious problem.</p><p>Up to this point you hadn\u2019t actually had a drink for three or four days. You\u2019d adopted a migraine a few days back just after you\u2019d visited your mum and had really been feeling it ever since. It no doubt developed after you\u2019d neglected to wear your glasses for all of about ten minutes at work, and you were really being punished for your stupidity.</p><p>The throbbing behind your eyes had begun to cause temporary blind spots in your vision, and for the first time in a week you were grateful for Harry\u2019s ongoing chauffeur service.</p><p>As you stand waiting for him by the back door of your work where he usually collects you, you don\u2019t notice the fact that you\u2019re all but glaring at the floor, frowning and squinting your eyes to try and relieve the pain. It\u2019s too bright outside; you can barely handle keeping your eyes open even a fraction because the sun is far too <i>shiny</i> for your liking today.</p><p>Because you\u2019re too busy insulting the pavement underneath you just with your face, you fail to notice Harry pull up mere inches in front of you. The fact that you\u2019re spending too much time thinking about how much your head hurts is only making it hurt <i>more</i>, and now you\u2019re just feeling pitiful at yourself.</p><p>Harry calling your name pulls you from your bubble of grumpiness, and your head snaps up to see his car literally right there in front of you. You can\u2019t quite believe that you actually managed to miss the huge thing approach you, and you internally scold yourself for being so fucking dramatic.</p><p>You blink at him wide eyed a couple of times and scramble into the passenger seat blindly, the white spots in your vision seemingly merging into one so that you really can\u2019t see much at all.</p><p>Harry\u2019s watching you awkwardly blink ahead of you as you pull your seatbelt on, and at first he finds it slightly amusing. But when you don\u2019t say anything at all and fall sideways so that your head is resting on the window, and your hand covers your eyes to block any further light getting in, he\u2019s concerned again. \u201cYou alright, love?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh uh.\u201d You mumble with a very gentle shake of your head. You\u2019re scared that talking might aggravate the throbbing further.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d Harry\u2019s throat is thick and tight, and he\u2019s now put the car into neutral so that he can angle himself towards you properly. He can see you\u2019re not well just from the even darker circles under your eyes and the fact that you\u2019re much, much paler in complexion than usual.</p><p>You take a deep breath, the pain in your head spiking from his words even though they were softer than you think you\u2019ve ever heard him speak. \u201cHead hurts.\u201d You whisper, and it\u2019s almost a whimper because you feel your cries threatening in your chest and your tears burning your eyes.</p><p>You\u2019ve been with Harry long enough for him to know that your migraines are common, but he\u2019s never seen one as bad as this. \u201cOkay,\u201d he breathes slowly, his releasing breath a little shaky with his concern for you, \u201clet\u2019s get you home and to bed.\u201d He takes your hand in his and brings it to his lips. He holds it the entire way home, only releasing it to change gear or indicate.</p><p>Regardless of your feelings of suffocation, you can\u2019t deny that you\u2019re grateful that Harry is still here and with you. You can\u2019t imagine doing this with anyone else. As much as you\u2019ve argued you\u2019re glad that it\u2019s him you\u2019re arguing with. As much as you\u2019ve struggled you\u2019re glad that it\u2019s him you\u2019re struggling with. Relationships are not just a walk in the park.</p><p>Harry throws you cautious glances every so often, but you never see them because your eyes remain closed until he\u2019s pulled onto the driveway. He\u2019s careful with you, helping you out of the car slowly since your sight is still temporarily\u2026 well, blank. He opens the door for you, and all but carries you upstairs to bed as his hands are holding your waist to make sure you don\u2019t fall.</p><p>You strip out your work clothes slowly, still frowning mostly at the floor as you do so. You pull on a t-shirt that Harry had left draped over the back of the chair as he gets you a glass of water. You\u2019ve drank more than enough water today but you still feel dehydrated and had no trouble downing the entire pint in less than a minute.</p><p>\u201cGood girl.\u201d Harry mumbles his praise quietly, and places a soft kiss to your forehead before disappearing to replace it.</p><p>When he returns you\u2019re already settled under the covers but your arms are crossed over your eyes to avoid the light flooding the room. Harry makes it his next task to cover the windows to block out the harsh sunlight, not even leaving a lamp on just in case.</p><p>\u201cGo to sleep, angel.\u201d He whispers to you, his hand caressing your stomach under your t-shirt as he leans down to place an ever so gentle kiss to your lips. \u201cI\u2019ll just be downstairs if you need me, alright?\u201d</p><p>You frown at his words and at the fact that he\u2019s already making a move for the door. You don\u2019t want him to leave you. Not yet anyway. \u201cWait,\u201d you sit up and call after him, though the sound is quiet as a mouse, \u201ccan you just\u2026 can y\u2019just lie with me a minute?\u201d</p><p>Harry turns back to you with a small smile, but even through your partial vision you can see in his eyes that he\u2019s elated you\u2019ve asked him. \u201cCourse I can, love.\u201d He hums, and soon enough he\u2019s crawling into bed beside you, tucking you into his side and nuzzling his nose into your hair.</p><p>This is the closest you\u2019ve felt to him for the longest time, all the tension the two of you have had seems to disappear, because right in this moment all that matters is that he cares about you and you care about him.</p><p>You\u2019re not sure whether it\u2019s your migraine, Harry\u2019s intoxicating smell or your exhaustion, but it only takes a matter of minutes for sleep to consume you, and you\u2019re finally slipping into the far corners of your dreams.</p><p>\u00ac</p><p>It\u2019s dark when you wake again. You\u2019re not sure of the time, but Harry is still holding you except he\u2019s moved you to lie between his legs. The tv is on and at its lowest possible volume, and you can tell that Harry\u2019s adjusted the brightness on it because it\u2019s usually a lot brighter than that.</p><p>You shift your position ever so slightly, and you feel Harry\u2019s arms tighten around you. You focus on the tv to adjust your vision, sitting up slowly and rubbing your eyes. Your migraine appears to have settled, though maybe not entirely as you can still feel a gentle ache in your left temple. <i>At least you can fucking see now though, right?</i></p><p>\u201cFeeling better?\u201d Harry asks quietly, his hand moving up to the side of your face to stroke your cheek. He\u2019d told you once your cheeks were magnificent, you\u2019ve never quite understood it.</p><p>You turn your head towards him and give him a small nod with a gentle smile. You notice that he looks extra pretty today. His curls are extra curly, and the warm light of the tv is giving him a sort of strange red hew. Even now his green eyes are piercing, and you hate how much you fucking love them. How much you fucking love him. You\u2019ve told him before to stop being so pretty because it\u2019s not fair on everyone else. What does he do in those circumstances? <i>Laugh</i>. Narcissist.</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d your words catch in your throat from sleep, so you clear your voice before speaking again, \u201cmuch better.\u201d</p><p>Harry\u2019s lips pull at the corners, and his eyes wrinkle at the beginnings of a smile. Any bigger and his dimples would threaten, and you\u2019d burst into tears because they\u2019re just so stupidly pretty all on their own. He reaches to the bedside table to hand you the water he\u2019d left for you earlier, and once again its gone in no time at all. \u201cAre you hungry?\u201d</p><p>His question has you listening to your stomach. The honest answer was no; you weren\u2019t hungry. But you knew Harry too well by this point that it was a rhetorical question and he was actually asking you what you want to eat. You didn\u2019t know that either. \u201cUm, not right now but I probably will be in like an hour.\u201d</p><p>Your answer seems to pacify him, though you can already guess what his next words will be. \u201cHopefully by the time dinner\u2019s ready you\u2019ll be hungry then.\u201d He raises his brows at you suggestively, smile widening to finally set those fucking dimples you\u2019ve been desperate to avoid.</p><p>\u201cYeah maybe.\u201d Is all you can fathom, and you frown at him in bewilderment but you\u2019re basically smiling through it anyway.</p><p>You\u2019re not that couple who dance and sing in the kitchen any more. You\u2019re also not the couple who stare at each other longingly from across the room at public events. You\u2019re not the couple who force your love for other people to see to prove a point, and you\u2019re not the couple who have completely fallen out of love either.</p><p>No, you\u2019re the couple that even after a tough time with one another managed to pull through and come out at the end of it still in love. Undeniably in love. You and Harry know that if you can survive a patch like you just have, you can probably survive the rest.</p><p>Relationships aren\u2019t a walk in the park. They take hard work, communication and effort. You and Harry might just feel like you\u2019ve finally found your balance to make yours work, and that\u2019s really all either of you can ask for.</p><p>~~~</p><p>Cheers! </p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"stylesinthewild:LOn-DkE_VAFK70lpIK4nFQ:Z-899i2bVcnmh\" data-orig-height=\"340\" data-orig-width=\"530\"><img alt=\"image\" src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/de541ed9b629905424ca63f7b6da2a79/tumblr_pehn6mQpVZ1v6scw1o1_540.gif\" data-orig-height=\"340\" data-orig-width=\"530\"></figure></p>",

The fact that you\u2019re spending too much time thinking about how much your head hurts is only making it hurt <i>more</i>, and now you\u2019re just feeling pitiful at yourself.</p><p>Harry calling your name pulls you from your bubble of grumpiness, and your head snaps up to see his car literally right there in front of you. You can\u2019t quite believe that you actually managed to miss the huge thing approach you, and you internally scold yourself for being so fucking dramatic.</p><p>You blink at him wide eyed a couple of times and scramble into the passenger seat blindly, the white spots in your vision seemingly merging into one so that you really can\u2019t see much at all.</p><p>Harry\u2019s watching you awkwardly blink ahead of you as you pull your seatbelt on, and at first he finds it slightly amusing. But when you don\u2019t say anything at all and fall sideways so that your head is resting on the window, and your hand covers your eyes to block any further light getting in, he\u2019s concerned again. \u201cYou alright, love?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh uh.\u201d You mumble with a very gentle shake of your head. You\u2019re scared that talking might aggravate the throbbing further.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d Harry\u2019s throat is thick and tight, and he\u2019s now put the car into neutral so that he can angle himself towards you properly. He can see you\u2019re not well just from the even darker circles under your eyes and the fact that you\u2019re much, much paler in complexion than usual.</p><p>You take a deep breath, the pain in your head spiking from his words even though they were softer than you think you\u2019ve ever heard him speak. \u201cHead hurts.\u201d You whisper, and it\u2019s almost a whimper because you feel your cries threatening in your chest and your tears burning your eyes.</p><p>You\u2019ve been with Harry long enough for him to know that your migraines are common, but he\u2019s never seen one as bad as this. \u201cOkay,\u201d he breathes slowly, his releasing breath a little shaky with his concern for you, \u201clet\u2019s get you home and to bed.\u201d He takes your hand in his and brings it to his lips. He holds it the entire way home, only releasing it to change gear or indicate.</p><p>Regardless of your feelings of suffocation, you can\u2019t deny that you\u2019re grateful that Harry is still here and with you. You can\u2019t imagine doing this with anyone else. As much as you\u2019ve argued you\u2019re glad that it\u2019s him you\u2019re arguing with. As much as you\u2019ve struggled you\u2019re glad that it\u2019s him you\u2019re struggling with. Relationships are not just a walk in the park.</p><p>Harry throws you cautious glances every so often, but you never see them because your eyes remain closed until he\u2019s pulled onto the driveway. He\u2019s careful with you, helping you out of the car slowly since your sight is still temporarily\u2026 well, blank. He opens the door for you, and all but carries you upstairs to bed as his hands are holding your waist to make sure you don\u2019t fall.</p><p>You strip out your work clothes slowly, still frowning mostly at the floor as you do so. You pull on a t-shirt that Harry had left draped over the back of the chair as he gets you a glass of water. You\u2019ve drank more than enough water today but you still feel dehydrated and had no trouble downing the entire pint in less than a minute.</p><p>\u201cGood girl.\u201d Harry mumbles his praise quietly, and places a soft kiss to your forehead before disappearing to replace it.</p><p>When he returns you\u2019re already settled under the covers but your arms are crossed over your eyes to avoid the light flooding the room. Harry makes it his next task to cover the windows to block out the harsh sunlight, not even leaving a lamp on just in case.</p><p>\u201cGo to sleep, angel.\u201d He whispers to you, his hand caressing your stomach under your t-shirt as he leans down to place an ever so gentle kiss to your lips. \u201cI\u2019ll just be downstairs if you need me, alright?\u201d</p><p>You frown at his words and at the fact that he\u2019s already making a move for the door. You don\u2019t want him to leave you. Not yet anyway. \u201cWait,\u201d you sit up and call after him, though the sound is quiet as a mouse, \u201ccan you just\u2026 can y\u2019just lie with me a minute?\u201d</p><p>Harry turns back to you with a small smile, but even through your partial vision you can see in his eyes that he\u2019s elated you\u2019ve asked him. \u201cCourse I can, love.\u201d He hums, and soon enough he\u2019s crawling into bed beside you, tucking you into his side and nuzzling his nose into your hair.</p><p>This is the closest you\u2019ve felt to him for the longest time, all the tension the two of you have had seems to disappear, because right in this moment all that matters is that he cares about you and you care about him.</p><p>You\u2019re not sure whether it\u2019s your migraine, Harry\u2019s intoxicating smell or your exhaustion, but it only takes a matter of minutes for sleep to consume you, and you\u2019re finally slipping into the far corners of your dreams.</p><p>\u00ac</p><p>It\u2019s dark when you wake again. You\u2019re not sure of the time, but Harry is still holding you except he\u2019s moved you to lie between his legs. The tv is on and at its lowest possible volume, and you can tell that Harry\u2019s adjusted the brightness on it because it\u2019s usually a lot brighter than that.</p><p>You shift your position ever so slightly, and you feel Harry\u2019s arms tighten around you. You focus on the tv to adjust your vision, sitting up slowly and rubbing your eyes. Your migraine appears to have settled, though maybe not entirely as you can still feel a gentle ache in your left temple. <i>At least you can fucking see now though, right?</i></p><p>\u201cFeeling better?\u201d Harry asks quietly, his hand moving up to the side of your face to stroke your cheek. He\u2019d told you once your cheeks were magnificent, you\u2019ve never quite understood it.</p><p>You turn your head towards him and give him a small nod with a gentle smile. You notice that he looks extra pretty today. His curls are extra curly, and the warm light of the tv is giving him a sort of strange red hew. Even now his green eyes are piercing, and you hate how much you fucking love them. How much you fucking love him. You\u2019ve told him before to stop being so pretty because it\u2019s not fair on everyone else. What does he do in those circumstances? <i>Laugh</i>. Narcissist.</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d your words catch in your throat from sleep, so you clear your voice before speaking again, \u201cmuch better.\u201d</p><p>Harry\u2019s lips pull at the corners, and his eyes wrinkle at the beginnings of a smile. Any bigger and his dimples would threaten, and you\u2019d burst into tears because they\u2019re just so stupidly pretty all on their own. He reaches to the bedside table to hand you the water he\u2019d left for you earlier, and once again its gone in no time at all. \u201cAre you hungry?\u201d</p><p>His question has you listening to your stomach. The honest answer was no; you weren\u2019t hungry. But you knew Harry too well by this point that it was a rhetorical question and he was actually asking you what you want to eat. You didn\u2019t know that either. \u201cUm, not right now but I probably will be in like an hour.\u201d</p><p>Your answer seems to pacify him, though you can already guess what his next words will be. \u201cHopefully by the time dinner\u2019s ready you\u2019ll be hungry then.\u201d He raises his brows at you suggestively, smile widening to finally set those fucking dimples you\u2019ve been desperate to avoid.</p><p>\u201cYeah maybe.\u201d Is all you can fathom, and you frown at him in bewilderment but you\u2019re basically smiling through it anyway.</p><p>You\u2019re not that couple who dance and sing in the kitchen any more. You\u2019re also not the couple who stare at each other longingly from across the room at public events. You\u2019re not the couple who force your love for other people to see to prove a point, and you\u2019re not the couple who have completely fallen out of love either.</p><p>No, you\u2019re the couple that even after a tough time with one another managed to pull through and come out at the end of it still in love. Undeniably in love. You and Harry know that if you can survive a patch like you just have, you can probably survive the rest.</p><p>Relationships aren\u2019t a walk in the park. They take hard work, communication and effort. You and Harry might just feel like you\u2019ve finally found your balance to make yours work, and that\u2019s really all either of you can ask for.</p><p>~~~</p><p>Cheers! </p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"stylesinthewild:LOn-DkE_VAFK70lpIK4nFQ:Z-899i2bVcnmh\" data-orig-height=\"340\" data-orig-width=\"530\"><img alt=\"image\" src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/de541ed9b629905424ca63f7b6da2a79/tumblr_pehn6mQpVZ1v6scw1o1_540.gif\" data-orig-height=\"340\" data-orig-width=\"530\"></figure></p>",

I&rsquo;m a little in shock at how much people loved <a href=\"http://waitingfortwilight.tumblr.com/post/182294868714/sit-down\">Sit Down</a>, and I know a few people asked for a part 2, SO I DID! I have to say a massive thank you to <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mEc9z2eqUqRfZQSKVCVt7fg\">@pendantstyles</a> for sharing my original post, Hannah is incredible and I love her &#10084;&#65039; please let me know if you like it!!!!!!!</i></b></p><p>~~~</p><p>You actually can&rsquo;t remember the last time you felt so&hellip; <i>floaty?</i> It&rsquo;s been just over a week since Harry apologised to you that Monday night in the kitchen after an argument over a bowl of soup, and he&rsquo;s acting weirder than ever now. You still weren&rsquo;t entirely yourself, and you hate to blame other people but you have to hold Harry partly responsible for your glumness.</p><p>Your relationship had gone from one extreme to the other; instead of being completely ignored and barely seeing him, he now absolutely would not leave you alone. He was working himself around you now, doing his best to be by your side at every opportunity.&nbsp;</p><p>Sure, it was nice on days one and two, feeling like you finally had your fianc&eacute; back after an impossible amount of time and actually starting to feel loved again. He&rsquo;s there in the morning when you get up, he takes you to work and making desperately sure to give you a kiss before you get out of his car. And then he&rsquo;s there when you finish to take you home again, always wearing a ridiculous smile that does make you laugh because he is just a bit ridiculous, isn&rsquo;t he?</p><p>For the first time in months Harry actually holds you as you sleep, his arms permanently wrapped around your middle the entire night. You&rsquo;re quite wriggly in bed, always have been and undoubtedly always will be, and he&rsquo;s even ignored that because he&rsquo;s absolutely damned if you&rsquo;re going anywhere.</p><p>You&rsquo;d actually been reminded of an advert you&rsquo;d seen on the telly recently; your mattress is getting old and your relationship is growing tired. You&rsquo;re separating emotionally and also physically which <i>must mean</i> it&rsquo;s time for a new mattress. You get your new mattress and miraculously your love for one another has re-blossomed. Except on this occasion you still have that same mattress and your fianc&eacute; has actually just stopped being a twat. For now anyway.</p><p>The problem was you didn&rsquo;t want Harry to be at your side every single minute of every single day. You just wanted it to go back to normal, how it had been when you got engaged. You were both incapable of being subtle about your feelings for one another but at the same time what you were doing together felt natural. Now everything feels forced, and you feel - and you really, <i>really</i> hate to admit it - suffocated.</p><p>Harry&rsquo;s constant attention is pulling your mind from itself, it was like you were watching yourself from another person&rsquo;s eyes. Like you were in subspace without the sex part. Like you were having an out of body experience. You just still weren&rsquo;t you.</p><p>You had no idea of Harry&rsquo;s concerns for you. He&rsquo;d paid attention to everything you did. He noticed the moment you got home you crashed on the sofa rather than immediately making dinner. Noticed the bags under your eyes from your exhaustion, and noticed your resignation from <i>any</i> task your were encumbered with.</p><p>Of the eight nights he&rsquo;s been secretly observing you, four of those you&rsquo;ve had a drink before bed. Two of them had been on days when you didn&rsquo;t have to work the next day, and the other two you&rsquo;d come home in a foul mood after a shit day. You&rsquo;d made love each of those four nights, and you don&rsquo;t like to brag but&hellip; <i>damn.</i></p><p>Much to your confusion he&rsquo;d visited your mum&rsquo;s with you that week. You&rsquo;d always go on a Sunday evening because she always seems to have plans literally every other day of the week. Harry didn&rsquo;t usually come with you, but for reasons unbeknownst to you he did this week, and your mum was over the moon.</p><p><i>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;</i> She&rsquo;d beamed between the both of you in absolute delight.<i> &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s open a bottle since Harry&rsquo;s finally decided to show his face again!&rdquo; </i>It hadn&rsquo;t been a dig at Harry, more a notion that he never accompanied you on your weekly visit and it was nice to see his face again.</p><p>You failed to notice the relief wash over Harry&rsquo;s face at your decline to her offer of a drink. Why would you think anything of it anyway? You&rsquo;re not one to indulge your mother&rsquo;s ignorance towards her very obvious problem.</p><p>Up to this point you hadn&rsquo;t actually had a drink for three or four days. You&rsquo;d adopted a migraine a few days back just after you&rsquo;d visited your mum and had really been feeling it ever since. It no doubt developed after you&rsquo;d neglected to wear your glasses for all of about ten minutes at work, and you were really being punished for your stupidity.</p><p>The throbbing behind your eyes had begun to cause temporary blind spots in your vision, and for the first time in a week you were grateful for Harry&rsquo;s ongoing chauffeur service.</p><p>As you stand waiting for him by the back door of your work where he usually collects you, you don&rsquo;t notice the fact that you&rsquo;re all but glaring at the floor, frowning and squinting your eyes to try and relieve the pain. It&rsquo;s too bright outside; you can barely handle keeping your eyes open even a fraction because the sun is far too <i>shiny</i> for your liking today.</p><p>Because you&rsquo;re too busy insulting the pavement underneath you just with your face, you fail to notice Harry pull up mere inches in front of you. The fact that you&rsquo;re spending too much time thinking about how much your head hurts is only making it hurt <i>more</i>, and now you&rsquo;re just feeling pitiful at yourself.</p><p>Harry calling your name pulls you from your bubble of grumpiness, and your head snaps up to see his car literally right there in front of you. You can&rsquo;t quite believe that you actually managed to miss the huge thing approach you, and you internally scold yourself for being so fucking dramatic.</p><p>You blink at him wide eyed a couple of times and scramble into the passenger seat blindly, the white spots in your vision seemingly merging into one so that you really can&rsquo;t see much at all.</p><p>Harry&rsquo;s watching you awkwardly blink ahead of you as you pull your seatbelt on, and at first he finds it slightly amusing. But when you don&rsquo;t say anything at all and fall sideways so that your head is resting on the window, and your hand covers your eyes to block any further light getting in, he&rsquo;s concerned again. &ldquo;You alright, love?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Uh uh.&rdquo; You mumble with a very gentle shake of your head.

        "body": "<p><b><i>A/N: tee hee did I just post two chapters in the span of 10 minutes?</i></b></p><p><br/></p><p>Vanilla is hands down Monica\u2019s favourite scent.</p><p>She smiles to herself as she spreads it along her skin, the\ntepid water gently pelting at her from the shower. It\u2019s so hot outside; she\nthought she\u2019d be a puddle if she reached home a minute later.</p><p>She feels much better than before when she\u2019s out of the\nshower, wrapped up in her bath robe and her left open. \u00a0Humming a song to herself, she changes into\nan old tee and a worn over pair of shorts, that had become softer with its\noveruse.</p><p>She looks at her phone, a hollow feeling occupying her\nstomach at the memory she recalls. The helpline she works at provided her with\na phone. A man, Mason Walters, had called from the hospital, <i>after </i>a suicide attempt - he\u2019d downed\nthe cleaning beach to almost half the can. He spewed curse after curse at\nMonica, and she took all of it.</p><p>She knew they were directed at his life, not at her. </p><p>Monica did what she could. \nShe talked about life. That life was about trying, not giving up; we are\nall born for a purpose, aren\u2019t we? Everybody has dark times. Some have it\nlonger and harder than others, but they all pass. It\u2019s in these times when our\nhard work, strength, and patience matter. </p><p>That is when people when know you a s a strong person, and\nwill respect you for that.</p><p>Mason hung up without saying anything. This is what scares\nMonica \u2013 she doesn\u2019t know if they\u2019re going to do it again. His name is put up\non her daily to \u2013 do board, in neon green paper. </p><p>She sighs as the events replay in her mind, lying down on\nher bed and switching the lights off and goes through her voicemails on her\npersonal phone. She\u2019s just about to lock her phone when a text from Harry\narrives.</p><p><i>Are you awake? I tried\ncalling you since the past hour and you\u2019re not answering the phone. \u2013H.</i></p><p>She face-palms herself, cursing at her forgetfulness. She\nrealized that her personal phone was on silent during work and she forgot to\nturn it off when she got home. There were six missed calls from him, which had\nMonica dialing his number quickly.</p><p>\u201cH-\u201c</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry I didn\u2019t answer your calls. I was, well, on my\nother phone. The one from the community. This guy, Mason, ended up drinking\nhalf a can of the cleaning bleach and called <i>after </i>he\u2019d been operated by the doctors,\u201d she said at once, pausing\nto take a breath. \u00a0\u201cDo you see how \u2013 \u201c</p><p>\u201cAre you even breathing? Calm down,\u201d Harry says, laughing.</p><p> Monica found herself\nsmiling too. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she sighs tiredly, closing her eyes and letting the\nexhaustion take over. \u201cHe was, just, really mad at life and he kind of took it\nall out on me, so\u2026 I am just peachy, I guess. Why did you want to call?\u201d</p><p>Harry gnawed on his bottom lip, forcing himself to speak,\n\u201cIt\u2019s \u2013 um \u2013 it\u2019s about\u2026 Avery.\u201d</p><p>There was a short pause on the other end. She took a steady\nbreath before replying. \u201cOkay. I\u2019m listening\u201d.</p><p>Those words were enough to calm him. <i>She\u2019s listening.</i>\u201dIt\u2019s her birthday, today,\u201d he says, his fingers\ntracing small circles on the couch\u2019s arm. </p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Monica flips onto her stomach. \u201cShe\u2019d be twenty five,\nright? \u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah\u2026\u201d he trails off, fingers jabbing a little harder on\nthe couch arm. \u201cI um \u2013 visited the cemetery, earlier.\u201d He sighs out. The very\nsubject of Avery weighs down upon his shoulders like a bag of bricks. He has\nnever been able to get over her. Even if he tried to, some memory of them would\ncome wafting into his brain and he\u2019ll pull himself back again. Sure, the wounds\non his heart burn less, but they don\u2019t hesitate to bleed afresh whenever those\nblue eyes appear in his dreams. </p><p>He is still functioning like a robot, having lost all will\nto do anything. He just wakes up every day to go work so that he can pay his\nbills.</p><p>\u201cDid\u2026 Avery, talk to you frequently?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cYeah, at least four times a week. We talked a lot. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe never mentioned that she was going to kill herself? Or\nwas, trying to?\u201d</p><p>Monica frowned, sitting up on the bed. \u201cNo, Harry. On the\ncontrary, I was pretty shocked when I came to know about the incident. It\u2019s\nastonishing how she did not let me get a hint of what she was feeling. I was\u2026\nstumped, when I heard.\u201d</p><p>Harry\u2019s brows furrow, reminiscing how broken she looked\nduring her last days. \u201cShe was pretty evasive during that time,\u201d his voice\nwavering a little.</p><p>\u201cHarry, you don\u2019t have to tell me right aw \u2013 \u201c</p><p>\u201cI caught her in the kitchen with a knife one day,\u201d he says\nin one breath. Monica\u2019s eyes widen in shock. \u201cI just came back home from work,\nonly to find her with that huge knife in her hand. She did not even look sad or\nscared. She looked focused; determined, even.\u201d Harry\u2019s voice becomes tight with\nemotion, him trying to gulp down the uneasy feeling spreading in his body at\nthe grim memory.</p><p><i>\u201cBabe?\u201d</i></p><p><i>The knife dropped from\nher hand, Avery jumped and yelping lightly in fright. She had her back towards\nhim, clutching her chest to calm down the sudden and sporadic heartbeat.</i></p><p><i>Harry was still taking\neverything in; he did not quite register the scene in front of him. This was\nnot something he wanted to come home to tonight.</i></p><p><i> On the way here, he thought it would be a good\nidea to order Chinese from the local restaurant for dinner and later they\u2019d\nshare a bath. He had been worrying constantly about her schizophrenia over the\npast few weeks. Also, his job was the cherry on top of the cake for him.</i></p><p><i>A nice, relaxing time\nwould be good for them, even if it lasts for a little bit.</i></p><p><i>So, surely, Harry was\npretty much bowled over at the sight in front of him. If he\u2019d arrived a minute\nlater, God knew what he\u2019d do and the thought was churning his stomach.</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\nhe says, his feet remain cemented on to the floor, not moving a single muscle\nsince he arrived at the doorway of his house. </i></p><p><i>He looks at her face,\nwhich showed an expression of disdain. She looked annoyed and angry, frustrated\neven. His gaze shifts to the shiny blade peeking from the side of the counter,\nlying on the floor.</i></p><p><i>\u201cOh my \u2013 ,\u201d Harry\nchokes on his words, everything clicking together in his brain. </i></p><p>\u201cShe even had the nerve to pick it up and try again,\u201d he\nsays. Her pained and desperate voice rings in Harry\u2019s ears, yelling at him to\nlet her kill herself and struggling to get out of his tight grip around her\nwith \u00a0him trying his best to retract the\nknife from her hand.<i> \u00a0</i></p><p>\u201cI just couldn\u2019t understand what was happening to her,\u201d he\nsays, his voice cracking between sobs. His face was red, a few tears trickling\ndown his face. \u201cWhat hurt her so bad that she even thought of killing herself?\nWasn\u2019t I enough? Weren\u2019t all her friends and family enough?\u201d He runs a hand\nthrough his face and hair, blowing out a gust of wind from his mouth, trying to\ncalm himself. He shuts his eyes tiredly as he says, \u201cWhy would anybody want to\ndo that to themselves?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, hey,\u201d Monica says. \u201cDon\u2019t blame yourself for what she\ndid. Nobody should be blamed.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOf course someone, or, <i>something,\n</i>is to blame!\u201d Harry exclaims in anger. \u201cDo you think a person will\nvoluntarily kill themselves? Was she in a <i>mood\n</i>that told her to kill herself?!\u201d Harry is panting by the end of the\nsentence, now sitting upright on the couch.</p><p>\u201cI did not mean to sound like that, Harry,\u201d Monica sighs.\nHarry has gone past whatever he\u2019s been restraining himself from.

It\u2019s in these times when our\nhard work, strength, and patience matter. </p><p>That is when people when know you a s a strong person, and\nwill respect you for that.</p><p>Mason hung up without saying anything. This is what scares\nMonica \u2013 she doesn\u2019t know if they\u2019re going to do it again. His name is put up\non her daily to \u2013 do board, in neon green paper. </p><p>She sighs as the events replay in her mind, lying down on\nher bed and switching the lights off and goes through her voicemails on her\npersonal phone. She\u2019s just about to lock her phone when a text from Harry\narrives.</p><p><i>Are you awake? I tried\ncalling you since the past hour and you\u2019re not answering the phone. \u2013H.</i></p><p>She face-palms herself, cursing at her forgetfulness. She\nrealized that her personal phone was on silent during work and she forgot to\nturn it off when she got home. There were six missed calls from him, which had\nMonica dialing his number quickly.</p><p>\u201cH-\u201c</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry I didn\u2019t answer your calls. I was, well, on my\nother phone. The one from the community. This guy, Mason, ended up drinking\nhalf a can of the cleaning bleach and called <i>after </i>he\u2019d been operated by the doctors,\u201d she said at once, pausing\nto take a breath. \u00a0\u201cDo you see how \u2013 \u201c</p><p>\u201cAre you even breathing?

Why did you want to call?\u201d</p><p>Harry gnawed on his bottom lip, forcing himself to speak,\n\u201cIt\u2019s \u2013 um \u2013 it\u2019s about\u2026 Avery.\u201d</p><p>There was a short pause on the other end. She took a steady\nbreath before replying. \u201cOkay.

The very\nsubject of Avery weighs down upon his shoulders like a bag of bricks. He has\nnever been able to get over her. Even if he tried to, some memory of them would\ncome wafting into his brain and he\u2019ll pull himself back again. Sure, the wounds\non his heart burn less, but they don\u2019t hesitate to bleed afresh whenever those\nblue eyes appear in his dreams. </p><p>He is still functioning like a robot, having lost all will\nto do anything. He just wakes up every day to go work so that he can pay his\nbills.</p><p>\u201cDid\u2026 Avery, talk to you frequently?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cYeah, at least four times a week. We talked a lot.

On the\ncontrary, I was pretty shocked when I came to know about the incident. It\u2019s\nastonishing how she did not let me get a hint of what she was feeling. I was\u2026\nstumped, when I heard.\u201d</p><p>Harry\u2019s brows furrow, reminiscing how broken she looked\nduring her last days. \u201cShe was pretty evasive during that time,\u201d his voice\nwavering a little.</p><p>\u201cHarry, you don\u2019t have to tell me right aw \u2013 \u201c</p><p>\u201cI caught her in the kitchen with a knife one day,\u201d he says\nin one breath. Monica\u2019s eyes widen in shock. \u201cI just came back home from work,\nonly to find her with that huge knife in her hand. She did not even look sad or\nscared. She looked focused; determined, even.\u201d Harry\u2019s voice becomes tight with\nemotion, him trying to gulp down the uneasy feeling spreading in his body at\nthe grim memory.</p><p><i>\u201cBabe?\u201d</i></p><p><i>The knife dropped from\nher hand, Avery jumped and yelping lightly in fright. She had her back towards\nhim, clutching her chest to calm down the sudden and sporadic heartbeat.</i></p><p><i>Harry was still taking\neverything in; he did not quite register the scene in front of him. This was\nnot something he wanted to come home to tonight.</i></p><p><i> On the way here, he thought it would be a good\nidea to order Chinese from the local restaurant for dinner and later they\u2019d\nshare a bath. He had been worrying constantly about her schizophrenia over the\npast few weeks. Also, his job was the cherry on top of the cake for him.</i></p><p><i>A nice, relaxing time\nwould be good for them, even if it lasts for a little bit.</i></p><p><i>So, surely, Harry was\npretty much bowled over at the sight in front of him. If he\u2019d arrived a minute\nlater, God knew what he\u2019d do and the thought was churning his stomach.</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\nhe says, his feet remain cemented on to the floor, not moving a single muscle\nsince he arrived at the doorway of his house. </i></p><p><i>He looks at her face,\nwhich showed an expression of disdain. She looked annoyed and angry, frustrated\neven. His gaze shifts to the shiny blade peeking from the side of the counter,\nlying on the floor.</i></p><p><i>\u201cOh my \u2013 ,\u201d Harry\nchokes on his words, everything clicking together in his brain. </i></p><p>\u201cShe even had the nerve to pick it up and try again,\u201d he\nsays. Her pained and desperate voice rings in Harry\u2019s ears, yelling at him to\nlet her kill herself and struggling to get out of his tight grip around her\nwith \u00a0him trying his best to retract the\nknife from her hand.<i> \u00a0</i></p><p>\u201cI just couldn\u2019t understand what was happening to her,\u201d he\nsays, his voice cracking between sobs. His face was red, a few tears trickling\ndown his face. \u201cWhat hurt her so bad that she even thought of killing herself?\nWasn\u2019t I enough? Weren\u2019t all her friends and family enough?\u201d He runs a hand\nthrough his face and hair, blowing out a gust of wind from his mouth, trying to\ncalm himself. He shuts his eyes tiredly as he says, \u201cWhy would anybody want to\ndo that to themselves?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, hey,\u201d Monica says. \u201cDon\u2019t blame yourself for what she\ndid. Nobody should be blamed.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOf course someone, or, <i>something,\n</i>is to blame!\u201d Harry exclaims in anger. \u201cDo you think a person will\nvoluntarily kill themselves? Was she in a <i>mood\n</i>that told her to kill herself?!\u201d Harry is panting by the end of the\nsentence, now sitting upright on the couch.</p><p>\u201cI did not mean to sound like that, Harry,\u201d Monica sighs.\nHarry has gone past whatever he\u2019s been restraining himself from.

Her pained and desperate voice rings in Harry\u2019s ears, yelling at him to\nlet her kill herself and struggling to get out of his tight grip around her\nwith \u00a0him trying his best to retract the\nknife from her hand.<i> \u00a0</i></p><p>\u201cI just couldn\u2019t understand what was happening to her,\u201d he\nsays, his voice cracking between sobs. His face was red, a few tears trickling\ndown his face. \u201cWhat hurt her so bad that she even thought of killing herself?\nWasn\u2019t I enough? Weren\u2019t all her friends and family enough?\u201d He runs a hand\nthrough his face and hair, blowing out a gust of wind from his mouth, trying to\ncalm himself. He shuts his eyes tiredly as he says, \u201cWhy would anybody want to\ndo that to themselves?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, hey,\u201d Monica says. \u201cDon\u2019t blame yourself for what she\ndid. Nobody should be blamed.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOf course someone, or, <i>something,\n</i>is to blame!\u201d Harry exclaims in anger. \u201cDo you think a person will\nvoluntarily kill themselves? Was she in a <i>mood\n</i>that told her to kill herself?!\u201d Harry is panting by the end of the\nsentence, now sitting upright on the couch.</p><p>\u201cI did not mean to sound like that, Harry,\u201d Monica sighs.\nHarry has gone past whatever he\u2019s been restraining himself from. He was at his\nbreaking point. Monica cannot imagine what it must have been like for him \u2013 to\nwatch the person you love slowly die from within and then entirely.</p><p>\u201cLook,\u201d Monica tries again when all she hears are harsh\nbreaths on the other end. \u201cThere must be something - if not someone - that must\nhave motivated her. Can you think of any bad incident that happened to her?\u201d</p><p>Harry has his head cradled in his palm, the other clutching\nhis phone. He shakes his head, \u201cNo, not that I can think of. We\u2019ve had our\nsilly tiffs, had bad days at work. That\u2019s it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Monica says, disappointed. \u201cWell\u2026 I\u2019m sorry, Harry.\u201d\nShe is genuinely sad for Harry. He is blaming himself for an incident that he\nis not responsible for. </p><p>When she doesn\u2019t hear him for the next minute or two, she\nspeaks up, \u201cHey, it\u2019s \u2013 um - almost two in the morning\u2026 and tomorrow\u2019s a\nSunday!\u201d she exclaims in realization. \u201cMaybe, we can\u2026 meet up?\u201d</p><p>Harry looks at the clock at her words, fingers wiping away\nthe traces of his tears. \u201cUh, okay. Park?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe park it is, at ten? \u201d Monica smiles. Her voice shifts\nonto a more serious tone, \u201cI know you\u2019re really shaken up now, Harry. Don\u2019t do\nanything stupid; Niall <i>will</i> report to\nme.\u201d </p><p>\u201cTen is fine.\u201d Harry says and hangs up.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t know what just happened to him. Revisiting all\nthose old memories had opened those wounds and dark chambers in his mind; her\nvoice, her eyes, her tears, everything appearing before his eyes and a blurred\nimage forms; messing with his lucidity.</p><p>And he hates the unbearable heartache that comes with it.</p><p>He looks at his phone and Monica\u2019s words ring in his head: <i>Don\u2019t do anything stupid. </i>They keep on\nblaring in his head, and his conscience fights to maintain its composure. A\nbottle of Jack Daniels awaits him on the counter, the amber colour luring him\nin.</p><p><i>Don\u2019t do anything\nstupid.</i></p><p>He shakes his head as if to dismiss the voice, and grabs the\nbottle swiftly. The burning in his throat as he chugs down the liquid tells him\nthat he is going to be okay, in a matter of time. </p><p>He\u2019d stumbled into her apartment \u2013 Amanda was her name, was\nit? \u2013 half an hour later. She said she had been waiting for him, and easily\nwelcomed him home, and into her body. He didn\u2019t care about anything at that\nmoment. He looked into her blue eyes and his throat choked up; he moved his\nhead to her shoulders as he guided his body in and out of her. It was fast,\nmessy, and empty.</p><p>When everything\u2019s over and April is fast asleep beside him,\nhe lays on her bed wide awake. The sickening feeling returns in his stomach as\nhe looks at her, and Monica\u2019s words ring again.</p><p><i>Don\u2019t do anything\nstupid.</i></p>",
                "content": "<p><b><i>A/N: tee hee did I just post two chapters in the span of 10 minutes?</i></b></p><p><br /></p><p>Vanilla is hands down Monica&rsquo;s favourite scent.</p><p>She smiles to herself as she spreads it along her skin, the\ntepid water gently pelting at her from the shower. It&rsquo;s so hot outside; she\nthought she&rsquo;d be a puddle if she reached home a minute later.</p><p>She feels much better than before when she&rsquo;s out of the\nshower, wrapped up in her bath robe and her left open. &nbsp;Humming a song to herself, she changes into\nan old tee and a worn over pair of shorts, that had become softer with its\noveruse.</p><p>She looks at her phone, a hollow feeling occupying her\nstomach at the memory she recalls. The helpline she works at provided her with\na phone. A man, Mason Walters, had called from the hospital, <i>after </i>a suicide attempt - he&rsquo;d downed\nthe cleaning beach to almost half the can. He spewed curse after curse at\nMonica, and she took all of it.</p><p>She knew they were directed at his life, not at her. </p><p>Monica did what she could. \nShe talked about life. That life was about trying, not giving up; we are\nall born for a purpose, aren&rsquo;t we? Everybody has dark times. Some have it\nlonger and harder than others, but they all pass. It&rsquo;s in these times when our\nhard work, strength, and patience matter. </p><p>That is when people when know you a s a strong person, and\nwill respect you for that.</p><p>Mason hung up without saying anything. This is what scares\nMonica &ndash; she doesn&rsquo;t know if they&rsquo;re going to do it again. His name is put up\non her daily to &ndash; do board, in neon green paper. </p><p>She sighs as the events replay in her mind, lying down on\nher bed and switching the lights off and goes through her voicemails on her\npersonal phone. She&rsquo;s just about to lock her phone when a text from Harry\narrives.</p><p><i>Are you awake? I tried\ncalling you since the past hour and you&rsquo;re not answering the phone. &ndash;H.</i></p><p>She face-palms herself, cursing at her forgetfulness. She\nrealized that her personal phone was on silent during work and she forgot to\nturn it off when she got home. There were six missed calls from him, which had\nMonica dialing his number quickly.</p><p>&ldquo;H-&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry I didn&rsquo;t answer your calls. I was, well, on my\nother phone. The one from the community. This guy, Mason, ended up drinking\nhalf a can of the cleaning bleach and called <i>after </i>he&rsquo;d been operated by the doctors,&rdquo; she said at once, pausing\nto take a breath. &nbsp;&ldquo;Do you see how &ndash; &ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Are you even breathing? Calm down,&rdquo; Harry says, laughing.</p><p> Monica found herself\nsmiling too. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; she sighs tiredly, closing her eyes and letting the\nexhaustion take over. &ldquo;He was, just, really mad at life and he kind of took it\nall out on me, so&hellip; I am just peachy, I guess. Why did you want to call?&rdquo;</p><p>Harry gnawed on his bottom lip, forcing himself to speak,\n&ldquo;It&rsquo;s &ndash; um &ndash; it&rsquo;s about&hellip; Avery.&rdquo;</p><p>There was a short pause on the other end. She took a steady\nbreath before replying. &ldquo;Okay. I&rsquo;m listening&rdquo;.</p><p>Those words were enough to calm him. <i>She&rsquo;s listening.</i>&rdquo;It&rsquo;s her birthday, today,&rdquo; he says, his fingers\ntracing small circles on the couch&rsquo;s arm. </p><p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; Monica flips onto her stomach. &ldquo;She&rsquo;d be twenty five,\nright? &rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah&hellip;&rdquo; he trails off, fingers jabbing a little harder on\nthe couch arm. &ldquo;I um &ndash; visited the cemetery, earlier.&rdquo; He sighs out. The very\nsubject of Avery weighs down upon his shoulders like a bag of bricks. He has\nnever been able to get over her. Even if he tried to, some memory of them would\ncome wafting into his brain and he&rsquo;ll pull himself back again. Sure, the wounds\non his heart burn less, but they don&rsquo;t hesitate to bleed afresh whenever those\nblue eyes appear in his dreams. </p><p>He is still functioning like a robot, having lost all will\nto do anything. He just wakes up every day to go work so that he can pay his\nbills.</p><p>&ldquo;Did&hellip; Avery, talk to you frequently?&rdquo; he asks.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, at least four times a week. We talked a lot. Why?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She never mentioned that she was going to kill herself? Or\nwas, trying to?&rdquo;</p><p>Monica frowned, sitting up on the bed. &ldquo;No, Harry. On the\ncontrary, I was pretty shocked when I came to know about the incident. It&rsquo;s\nastonishing how she did not let me get a hint of what she was feeling. I was&hellip;\nstumped, when I heard.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry&rsquo;s brows furrow, reminiscing how broken she looked\nduring her last days. &ldquo;She was pretty evasive during that time,&rdquo; his voice\nwavering a little.</p><p>&ldquo;Harry, you don&rsquo;t have to tell me right aw &ndash; &ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I caught her in the kitchen with a knife one day,&rdquo; he says\nin one breath. Monica&rsquo;s eyes widen in shock. &ldquo;I just came back home from work,\nonly to find her with that huge knife in her hand. She did not even look sad or\nscared. She looked focused; determined, even.&rdquo; Harry&rsquo;s voice becomes tight with\nemotion, him trying to gulp down the uneasy feeling spreading in his body at\nthe grim memory.</p><p><i>&ldquo;Babe?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>The knife dropped from\nher hand, Avery jumped and yelping lightly in fright. She had her back towards\nhim, clutching her chest to calm down the sudden and sporadic heartbeat.</i></p><p><i>Harry was still taking\neverything in; he did not quite register the scene in front of him. This was\nnot something he wanted to come home to tonight.</i></p><p><i> On the way here, he thought it would be a good\nidea to order Chinese from the local restaurant for dinner and later they&rsquo;d\nshare a bath.

(If anyone\u2019s reading, that is.)</i></b></p><p><b><i><br/></i></b></p><p>Tonight was one of the times Harry regretted having Niall as\nhis best friend.</p><p>Not literally, but his rave and wild parties just ticked\nHarry off. \u00a0He stayed away from all of\nthe commotion, in a secluded corner of the kitchen. </p><p>If Niall wasn\u2019t his best friend, he\u2019d been out of this party\nat lightning speed.</p><p>The lad is 24 now, and he still hosts parties like a\nteenager. There\u2019s mad howling everywhere, two huge crates of booze on his\nkitchen counter, music thundering throughout the whole house and Harry is\nwondering how his poor neighbors are putting up with this madness. </p><p>They\u2019re probably not going to talk to them anytime soon.</p><p>\u201cI thought you left or something. I came here an hour ago\nand couldn\u2019t find you anywhere.\u201d Harry can barely hear through the music, but\nhe can make out that that it was Monica who was talking to him.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t really like \u2013\u201che stopped short when he turned\naround, getting a full view of her. She was dressed in a white sweater that was\nsubtly accented with glitter and black pants, the tiniest bit of make \u2013 up on\nher face. \u00a0</p><p>She managed to look prettier than all the other women in his\nflat.</p><p>\u201cHarry? You there?\u201d she waved in front of his face, causing\nhim to blink rapidly. <i>Idiot, </i>he\nmentally scolded himself. She was filling a glass of water for herself and\noffered Harry some, which he gladly accepted.</p><p>\u201cYou were saying something,\u201d Monica said as she sipped from\nher glass.</p><p>\u201cI just don\u2019tlike parties, that\u2019s all\u201d He says, quickly\nchugging down the water and setting it down on the counter. People were irked\nby his dislike for parties because who doesn\u2019t like parties today? Like, booze\nand people to sleep with for free, and he doesn\u2019t want that?</p><p>\u201cOh, thank God, I was bloody suffocating in here. I absolutely\ndetest parties, these kinds.\u201d She pointed her finger towards the scene in front\nof them, swaying the glass in her clutch. \u201cI mean, I was thinking he\u2019d host a\nreally small party, I didn\u2019t even dress up properly,\u201d she laughs, looking down\nat her outfit.</p><p><i>\u201cHarry! Get off that\nbloody phone and look!\u201d Avery yells from the bedroom and threw the cushion\nclosest to her at him. </i></p><p><i>\u201cWhat?\u201d he exclaimed\nin annoyance, looking up at her. </i></p><p><i>He legit lost his\nbreath when he took in what he saw. She was wearing a soft pink dress, hugging\nher body throughout.</i></p><p><i>\u201cSo?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou look so ravishing\nthat I\u2019m thinking of skipping that dinner and taking you right here,\u201d he says,\nhis eyes not blinking for a split second. He can see the same color rising in\nher cheeks, as she looked down.</i></p><p><i>\u201cI\u2019m not overdressed,\nam I? Is it too tight? Too revealing? I just really want your family to like\nme.\u201d </i></p><p><i>\u201cYou\u2019d look perfect\neven in a trash bag, love.\u201d Harry chuckled, ending her rambling. He walked\ntowards her and grasped her shoulders firmly, with a gentle touch. \u201cYou look\nbeautiful, okay? And mum loves you anyways, so you don\u2019t have to worry about\nthat.\u201d He presses a kiss to her lips.</i></p><p>Harry frowned at her words. She wasn\u2019t dressed\ninappropriately. \u201cYou look just fine; half of the girls here have their chests\nspilling out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, not a fan of that either.\u201d She finishes her glass of\nwater and sets it beside her on the counter. \u201cI just don\u2019t \u2013 wow, you have\ntattoos?\u201d she immediately shifts closer to Harry, examining the anchor on the\nwrist. She\u2019d always seen him dressed with full sleeves up till now. He was wearing\none of his dress shirts with sleeves rolled up to his elbows. </p><p> \u201cCan I?\u201d she asks,\nlooking up at him shyly. He knows that she doesn\u2019t want to make it all awkward\nand go right in and touch the tattoos. \nHe nods and Monica\u2019s finger gently grips his wrist, before turning it\naround and noticing the other tattoos. </p><p>\u201cA naked mermaid, seriously?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged his shoulders nonchalantly. \u201cWhat, I got it\nbecause I liked it. Don\u2019t judge.\u201d Monica looks at him for two seconds before\nraising her hands in surrender, stepping away from him. </p><p>\u201cThat girl\u2019s been giving us quite the eye,\u201d Monica says,\nturning around quickly. Confused, Harry scans the crowd for the said girl, and\nhe finds her almost immediately; Emma. She\u2019s scowling at them as if they were\nthose nasty raccoons from his mum\u2019s backyard. </p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have come to this party, I feel so\nuncomfortable.\u201d Monica grimaces, looking back up at Harry. \u201cI\u2019ll just \u2026leave,\u201d\nshe says to herself, before walking past Harry. He sees her squeezing her way\nthrough the crowd to collect her coat. </p><p>He stands there, blinking at the now empty spot at the door.\nHe doesn\u2019t know which silly nerve in him and what stupid chakra \u2013 Niall forced\nhim to take yoga with him - in him compelled him to do so, because he quickly\nfinds himself getting his own coat from the rack and hurtling through the door.</p><p>The hallway is empty, as he expected. He gets in the lift,\ntapping his foot in anticipation. He figures she\u2019d be out of the complex by\nnow, making him groan. </p><p>Sprinting out of the lift, he is out of the building\u2019s door\nin a second. There are few people on the streets, a little chill that instantly\nmakes him thrust his hands in his coat pockets. He looks around, twice; but he\ndoesn\u2019t find who he was looking for. He was dejectedly making his way back\nupstairs when a sparkly sweater caught his sight quite a distance away. </p><p><i>She\u2019s dangerously\ntiny, </i>he thinks as he hurriedly makes his way over to her. She\u2019s walking at\na moderate pace, so it was easy to catch up with her.</p><p>\u201cMonica, wait \u2013 \u201c</p><p>\u201c<i>Oh, my!\u201d</i> she\nscreeches, ponytail whipping around as she turns around. She is visibly white\nand shook, and Harry curses himself for his timing. She takes a few seconds to\nrecompose herself, a hand on her chest to steady her rapid heartbeat.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean to scare you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou better be,\u201d she grumbles, looking up at him with\ndisdain. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did you leave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I didn\u2019t like it there. I\u2019ll apologize to Niall\ntomorrow, but I just couldn\u2019t bear the loud music and all that drunken mess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Harry says, his throat closing in again. He realizes\nthat this happens whenever Monica is around. \u201cDo you, um \u2013 there\u2019s a diner down\nthe street, not very far from here.\u201d Harry says the words so quickly he wonders\nif she\u2019d been able to make out anything.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not for some time at least,\u201d he sighs. \u201cLike you said,\nthe music and drunken shit doesn\u2019t fit me as well.\u201d He manages a nervous smile.</p><p>Monica\u2019s eyes widen, \u201cOh, okay. I guess I can use some food;\ndidn\u2019t have anything for three hours.\u201d</p><p>They quietly make their way to the diner. Harry feels this\nunusual wash of peace around him, enjoying the leisurely stroll amidst the few\npeople who were walking in the streets. He notices how short she really is,\nbarely reaching up to his shoulders. </p><p>Monica\u2019s insides are riveting with a sudden energy. </p><p>Her hands were sweating and her nerves were buzzing. Buzzing\nwith what, she didn\u2019t know. But it was the good kind of buzz. Harry led her to\none of the booths in the diner, the typical kind and soft retro music thrumming\naway. </p><p>\u201cIs it always this empty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Tuesday, so it\u2019s not as crowded as it is during the\nweekends. It\u2019s bloody impossible to breathe here at Sunday nights.\u201d Harry says,\nslipping into the seat across from her. </p><p>To others in the diner, it would seem as if they were a\ncouple who\u2019d come here to have a quiet time for themselves. She\u2019s not feeling\nanything for him \u2013 no, she\u2019s not. But Harry\u2019s actions are warming her insides\nbecause nobody really does nice things for her. She\u2019s had near utter shitty\nrelationships \u2013 the guy would only treat her to something if it was her\nbirthday or something</p><p>Harry, on the other hand, was just being nice.</p><p>\u201cDo you have anything in particular you want to order?\u201d</p><p> \u201cI\u2019ll take whatever\nyou\u2019re taking. You\u2019ve been here before, so I trust you with this,\u201d she smirks,\nleaning back on the plush back of her seat. Harry scans the menu for a while\nbefore ordering two chicken burgers with fries.</p><p>It\u2019s an easy silence between them. Normally, it would bug\nhim out if it was this quiet between him and someone else. But with Monica,\nit\u2019s easy. It feels good.</p><p>The two of them at a diner, retro music in the background,\nand a few cars in the background \u2013Harry\u2019s never felt this content in a long\ntime.</p><p>\u201cSo, how\u2019s work?\u201d Monica quips after a while.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, I guess. The same thing every day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? I thought a job at publishing was real good. All\nyou do is read and get paid for.\u201d</p><p>Her words elicit a small laugh from Harry. \u201cIt\u2019s not just\nthat. There\u2019s an entire bunch of people even behind a 100 page book. Editing is\nonly half of the work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least it\u2019s better than working in a record store.\u201d She\nsays, taking a bite of from her fry. \u201cAnd a suicide hotline, I guess.\u201d She adds\nquietly.</p><p>Harry disagreed. \u201cNo, you help save lives there,\u201d he says.\n\u201cYou have to give yourself some credit for that.\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head, smiling wanly at him. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy to\nlisten to people telling you that they want to die time and again.

People were irked\nby his dislike for parties because who doesn\u2019t like parties today? Like, booze\nand people to sleep with for free, and he doesn\u2019t want that?</p><p>\u201cOh, thank God, I was bloody suffocating in here. I absolutely\ndetest parties, these kinds.\u201d She pointed her finger towards the scene in front\nof them, swaying the glass in her clutch. \u201cI mean, I was thinking he\u2019d host a\nreally small party, I didn\u2019t even dress up properly,\u201d she laughs, looking down\nat her outfit.</p><p><i>\u201cHarry!

I just really want your family to like\nme.\u201d </i></p><p><i>\u201cYou\u2019d look perfect\neven in a trash bag, love.\u201d Harry chuckled, ending her rambling.

And mum loves you anyways, so you don\u2019t have to worry about\nthat.\u201d He presses a kiss to her lips.</i></p><p>Harry frowned at her words. She wasn\u2019t dressed\ninappropriately. \u201cYou look just fine; half of the girls here have their chests\nspilling out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, not a fan of that either.\u201d She finishes her glass of\nwater and sets it beside her on the counter. \u201cI just don\u2019t \u2013 wow, you have\ntattoos?\u201d she immediately shifts closer to Harry, examining the anchor on the\nwrist. She\u2019d always seen him dressed with full sleeves up till now. He was wearing\none of his dress shirts with sleeves rolled up to his elbows. </p><p> \u201cCan I?\u201d she asks,\nlooking up at him shyly. He knows that she doesn\u2019t want to make it all awkward\nand go right in and touch the tattoos. \nHe nods and Monica\u2019s finger gently grips his wrist, before turning it\naround and noticing the other tattoos. </p><p>\u201cA naked mermaid, seriously?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged his shoulders nonchalantly. \u201cWhat, I got it\nbecause I liked it. Don\u2019t judge.\u201d Monica looks at him for two seconds before\nraising her hands in surrender, stepping away from him. </p><p>\u201cThat girl\u2019s been giving us quite the eye,\u201d Monica says,\nturning around quickly. Confused, Harry scans the crowd for the said girl, and\nhe finds her almost immediately; Emma. She\u2019s scowling at them as if they were\nthose nasty raccoons from his mum\u2019s backyard. </p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have come to this party, I feel so\nuncomfortable.\u201d Monica grimaces, looking back up at Harry. \u201cI\u2019ll just \u2026leave,\u201d\nshe says to herself, before walking past Harry. He sees her squeezing her way\nthrough the crowd to collect her coat. </p><p>He stands there, blinking at the now empty spot at the door.\nHe doesn\u2019t know which silly nerve in him and what stupid chakra \u2013 Niall forced\nhim to take yoga with him - in him compelled him to do so, because he quickly\nfinds himself getting his own coat from the rack and hurtling through the door.</p><p>The hallway is empty, as he expected. He gets in the lift,\ntapping his foot in anticipation. He figures she\u2019d be out of the complex by\nnow, making him groan. </p><p>Sprinting out of the lift, he is out of the building\u2019s door\nin a second. There are few people on the streets, a little chill that instantly\nmakes him thrust his hands in his coat pockets. He looks around, twice; but he\ndoesn\u2019t find who he was looking for. He was dejectedly making his way back\nupstairs when a sparkly sweater caught his sight quite a distance away. </p><p><i>She\u2019s dangerously\ntiny, </i>he thinks as he hurriedly makes his way over to her. She\u2019s walking at\na moderate pace, so it was easy to catch up with her.</p><p>\u201cMonica, wait \u2013 \u201c</p><p>\u201c<i>Oh, my!\u201d</i> she\nscreeches, ponytail whipping around as she turns around. She is visibly white\nand shook, and Harry curses himself for his timing. She takes a few seconds to\nrecompose herself, a hand on her chest to steady her rapid heartbeat.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean to scare you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou better be,\u201d she grumbles, looking up at him with\ndisdain. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did you leave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I didn\u2019t like it there. I\u2019ll apologize to Niall\ntomorrow, but I just couldn\u2019t bear the loud music and all that drunken mess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Harry says, his throat closing in again. He realizes\nthat this happens whenever Monica is around. \u201cDo you, um \u2013 there\u2019s a diner down\nthe street, not very far from here.\u201d Harry says the words so quickly he wonders\nif she\u2019d been able to make out anything.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not for some time at least,\u201d he sighs. \u201cLike you said,\nthe music and drunken shit doesn\u2019t fit me as well.\u201d He manages a nervous smile.</p><p>Monica\u2019s eyes widen, \u201cOh, okay. I guess I can use some food;\ndidn\u2019t have anything for three hours.\u201d</p><p>They quietly make their way to the diner. Harry feels this\nunusual wash of peace around him, enjoying the leisurely stroll amidst the few\npeople who were walking in the streets. He notices how short she really is,\nbarely reaching up to his shoulders. </p><p>Monica\u2019s insides are riveting with a sudden energy. </p><p>Her hands were sweating and her nerves were buzzing. Buzzing\nwith what, she didn\u2019t know. But it was the good kind of buzz. Harry led her to\none of the booths in the diner, the typical kind and soft retro music thrumming\naway. </p><p>\u201cIs it always this empty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Tuesday, so it\u2019s not as crowded as it is during the\nweekends. It\u2019s bloody impossible to breathe here at Sunday nights.\u201d Harry says,\nslipping into the seat across from her. </p><p>To others in the diner, it would seem as if they were a\ncouple who\u2019d come here to have a quiet time for themselves. She\u2019s not feeling\nanything for him \u2013 no, she\u2019s not. But Harry\u2019s actions are warming her insides\nbecause nobody really does nice things for her. She\u2019s had near utter shitty\nrelationships \u2013 the guy would only treat her to something if it was her\nbirthday or something</p><p>Harry, on the other hand, was just being nice.</p><p>\u201cDo you have anything in particular you want to order?\u201d</p><p> \u201cI\u2019ll take whatever\nyou\u2019re taking. You\u2019ve been here before, so I trust you with this,\u201d she smirks,\nleaning back on the plush back of her seat. Harry scans the menu for a while\nbefore ordering two chicken burgers with fries.</p><p>It\u2019s an easy silence between them. Normally, it would bug\nhim out if it was this quiet between him and someone else. But with Monica,\nit\u2019s easy. It feels good.</p><p>The two of them at a diner, retro music in the background,\nand a few cars in the background \u2013Harry\u2019s never felt this content in a long\ntime.</p><p>\u201cSo, how\u2019s work?\u201d Monica quips after a while.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, I guess. The same thing every day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? I thought a job at publishing was real good. All\nyou do is read and get paid for.\u201d</p><p>Her words elicit a small laugh from Harry. \u201cIt\u2019s not just\nthat. There\u2019s an entire bunch of people even behind a 100 page book. Editing is\nonly half of the work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least it\u2019s better than working in a record store.\u201d She\nsays, taking a bite of from her fry. \u201cAnd a suicide hotline, I guess.\u201d She adds\nquietly.</p><p>Harry disagreed. \u201cNo, you help save lives there,\u201d he says.\n\u201cYou have to give yourself some credit for that.\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head, smiling wanly at him. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy to\nlisten to people telling you that they want to die time and again. They sound\nso broken and helpless on the phone, it\u2019s very hard to maintain composure and\nget them to stop thinking about death,\u201d she sighs. \u201cIt surprises me sometimes,\nyou know? The amount of sad people around the world is just\u2026\u201d</p><p>Harry knows. </p><p>He knows what it is like.</p><p>He knows what it is like to deal with a person like that. He\nknows how it pains when you see them hurting, when you see them so weak you\nbegin to think that they are actually dead, the frustration when they don\u2019t\nlisten to you and give in to their demons.</p><p>\u201cOverwhelming.\u201d Harry completes the sentence for her. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I said that,\u201d she shakes her head, waving her\nhand as if to dismiss the conversation.\u201dRuining the mood, and all.\u201d She laughs.\nHer eyes are alight with warmth in them and Harry catches himself staring at\nthem.

He realizes\nthat this happens whenever Monica is around. \u201cDo you, um \u2013 there\u2019s a diner down\nthe street, not very far from here.\u201d Harry says the words so quickly he wonders\nif she\u2019d been able to make out anything.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not for some time at least,\u201d he sighs. \u201cLike you said,\nthe music and drunken shit doesn\u2019t fit me as well.\u201d He manages a nervous smile.</p><p>Monica\u2019s eyes widen, \u201cOh, okay. I guess I can use some food;\ndidn\u2019t have anything for three hours.\u201d</p><p>They quietly make their way to the diner. Harry feels this\nunusual wash of peace around him, enjoying the leisurely stroll amidst the few\npeople who were walking in the streets. He notices how short she really is,\nbarely reaching up to his shoulders. </p><p>Monica\u2019s insides are riveting with a sudden energy. </p><p>Her hands were sweating and her nerves were buzzing. Buzzing\nwith what, she didn\u2019t know. But it was the good kind of buzz. Harry led her to\none of the booths in the diner, the typical kind and soft retro music thrumming\naway. </p><p>\u201cIs it always this empty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Tuesday, so it\u2019s not as crowded as it is during the\nweekends. It\u2019s bloody impossible to breathe here at Sunday nights.\u201d Harry says,\nslipping into the seat across from her. </p><p>To others in the diner, it would seem as if they were a\ncouple who\u2019d come here to have a quiet time for themselves. She\u2019s not feeling\nanything for him \u2013 no, she\u2019s not. But Harry\u2019s actions are warming her insides\nbecause nobody really does nice things for her. She\u2019s had near utter shitty\nrelationships \u2013 the guy would only treat her to something if it was her\nbirthday or something</p><p>Harry, on the other hand, was just being nice.</p><p>\u201cDo you have anything in particular you want to order?\u201d</p><p> \u201cI\u2019ll take whatever\nyou\u2019re taking. You\u2019ve been here before, so I trust you with this,\u201d she smirks,\nleaning back on the plush back of her seat. Harry scans the menu for a while\nbefore ordering two chicken burgers with fries.</p><p>It\u2019s an easy silence between them. Normally, it would bug\nhim out if it was this quiet between him and someone else. But with Monica,\nit\u2019s easy. It feels good.</p><p>The two of them at a diner, retro music in the background,\nand a few cars in the background \u2013Harry\u2019s never felt this content in a long\ntime.</p><p>\u201cSo, how\u2019s work?\u201d Monica quips after a while.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, I guess. The same thing every day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? I thought a job at publishing was real good. All\nyou do is read and get paid for.\u201d</p><p>Her words elicit a small laugh from Harry. \u201cIt\u2019s not just\nthat. There\u2019s an entire bunch of people even behind a 100 page book. Editing is\nonly half of the work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least it\u2019s better than working in a record store.\u201d She\nsays, taking a bite of from her fry. \u201cAnd a suicide hotline, I guess.\u201d She adds\nquietly.</p><p>Harry disagreed. \u201cNo, you help save lives there,\u201d he says.\n\u201cYou have to give yourself some credit for that.\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head, smiling wanly at him. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy to\nlisten to people telling you that they want to die time and again. They sound\nso broken and helpless on the phone, it\u2019s very hard to maintain composure and\nget them to stop thinking about death,\u201d she sighs. \u201cIt surprises me sometimes,\nyou know? The amount of sad people around the world is just\u2026\u201d</p><p>Harry knows. </p><p>He knows what it is like.</p><p>He knows what it is like to deal with a person like that. He\nknows how it pains when you see them hurting, when you see them so weak you\nbegin to think that they are actually dead, the frustration when they don\u2019t\nlisten to you and give in to their demons.</p><p>\u201cOverwhelming.\u201d Harry completes the sentence for her. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I said that,\u201d she shakes her head, waving her\nhand as if to dismiss the conversation.\u201dRuining the mood, and all.\u201d She laughs.\nHer eyes are alight with warmth in them and Harry catches himself staring at\nthem. A smile comes up on his face, a <i>little\n</i>overwhelmed by her beauty.</p><p> He knows she\u2019s\nsympathetic to the people who call. She listens to these people every single\nday and yet she\u2019s able to cheer up a person like him.</p><p>If anything, Harry accepts the fact that she\u2019s stronger than\nhim. </p><p>-</p>",
                "content": "<p><b><i>The link seems broken on my page?? I just realized I did not even upload the chap? Anyways, sorry to keep you waiting. (If anyone&rsquo;s reading, that is.)</i></b></p><p><b><i><br /></i></b></p><p>Tonight was one of the times Harry regretted having Niall as\nhis best friend.</p><p>Not literally, but his rave and wild parties just ticked\nHarry off. &nbsp;He stayed away from all of\nthe commotion, in a secluded corner of the kitchen. </p><p>If Niall wasn&rsquo;t his best friend, he&rsquo;d been out of this party\nat lightning speed.</p><p>The lad is 24 now, and he still hosts parties like a\nteenager. There&rsquo;s mad howling everywhere, two huge crates of booze on his\nkitchen counter, music thundering throughout the whole house and Harry is\nwondering how his poor neighbors are putting up with this madness. </p><p>They&rsquo;re probably not going to talk to them anytime soon.</p><p>&ldquo;I thought you left or something. I came here an hour ago\nand couldn&rsquo;t find you anywhere.&rdquo; Harry can barely hear through the music, but\nhe can make out that that it was Monica who was talking to him.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t really like &ndash;&ldquo;he stopped short when he turned\naround, getting a full view of her. She was dressed in a white sweater that was\nsubtly accented with glitter and black pants, the tiniest bit of make &ndash; up on\nher face. &nbsp;</p><p>She managed to look prettier than all the other women in his\nflat.</p><p>&ldquo;Harry? You there?&rdquo; she waved in front of his face, causing\nhim to blink rapidly. <i>Idiot, </i>he\nmentally scolded himself. She was filling a glass of water for herself and\noffered Harry some, which he gladly accepted.</p><p>&ldquo;You were saying something,&rdquo; Monica said as she sipped from\nher glass.</p><p>&ldquo;I just don&rsquo;tlike parties, that&rsquo;s all&rdquo; He says, quickly\nchugging down the water and setting it down on the counter. People were irked\nby his dislike for parties because who doesn&rsquo;t like parties today? Like, booze\nand people to sleep with for free, and he doesn&rsquo;t want that?</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, thank God, I was bloody suffocating in here. I absolutely\ndetest parties, these kinds.&rdquo; She pointed her finger towards the scene in front\nof them, swaying the glass in her clutch. &ldquo;I mean, I was thinking he&rsquo;d host a\nreally small party, I didn&rsquo;t even dress up properly,&rdquo; she laughs, looking down\nat her outfit.</p><p><i>&ldquo;Harry! Get off that\nbloody phone and look!&rdquo; Avery yells from the bedroom and threw the cushion\nclosest to her at him. </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; he exclaimed\nin annoyance, looking up at her. </i></p><p><i>He legit lost his\nbreath when he took in what he saw. She was wearing a soft pink dress, hugging\nher body throughout.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;So?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;You look so ravishing\nthat I&rsquo;m thinking of skipping that dinner and taking you right here,&rdquo; he says,\nhis eyes not blinking for a split second. He can see the same color rising in\nher cheeks, as she looked down.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not overdressed,\nam I? Is it too tight? Too revealing? I just really want your family to like\nme.&rdquo; </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d look perfect\neven in a trash bag, love.&rdquo; Harry chuckled, ending her rambling. He walked\ntowards her and grasped her shoulders firmly, with a gentle touch. &ldquo;You look\nbeautiful, okay? And mum loves you anyways, so you don&rsquo;t have to worry about\nthat.&rdquo; He presses a kiss to her lips.</i></p><p>Harry frowned at her words. She wasn&rsquo;t dressed\ninappropriately. &ldquo;You look just fine; half of the girls here have their chests\nspilling out.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, not a fan of that either.&rdquo; She finishes her glass of\nwater and sets it beside her on the counter. &ldquo;I just don&rsquo;t &ndash; wow, you have\ntattoos?&rdquo; she immediately shifts closer to Harry, examining the anchor on the\nwrist. She&rsquo;d always seen him dressed with full sleeves up till now. He was wearing\none of his dress shirts with sleeves rolled up to his elbows. </p><p> &ldquo;Can I?&rdquo; she asks,\nlooking up at him shyly. He knows that she doesn&rsquo;t want to make it all awkward\nand go right in and touch the tattoos. \nHe nods and Monica&rsquo;s finger gently grips his wrist, before turning it\naround and noticing the other tattoos. </p><p>&ldquo;A naked mermaid, seriously?&rdquo;</p><p>He shrugged his shoulders nonchalantly. &ldquo;What, I got it\nbecause I liked it. Don&rsquo;t judge.&rdquo; Monica looks at him for two seconds before\nraising her hands in surrender, stepping away from him. </p><p>&ldquo;That girl&rsquo;s been giving us quite the eye,&rdquo; Monica says,\nturning around quickly. Confused, Harry scans the crowd for the said girl, and\nhe finds her almost immediately; Emma. She&rsquo;s scowling at them as if they were\nthose nasty raccoons from his mum&rsquo;s backyard. </p><p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t have come to this party, I feel so\nuncomfortable.&rdquo; Monica grimaces, looking back up at Harry. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just &hellip;leave,&rdquo;\nshe says to herself, before walking past Harry. He sees her squeezing her way\nthrough the crowd to collect her coat. </p><p>He stands there, blinking at the now empty spot at the door.\nHe doesn&rsquo;t know which silly nerve in him and what stupid chakra &ndash; Niall forced\nhim to take yoga with him - in him compelled him to do so, because he quickly\nfinds himself getting his own coat from the rack and hurtling through the door.</p><p>The hallway is empty, as he expected. He gets in the lift,\ntapping his foot in anticipation. He figures she&rsquo;d be out of the complex by\nnow, making him groan. </p><p>Sprinting out of the lift, he is out of the building&rsquo;s door\nin a second. There are few people on the streets, a little chill that instantly\nmakes him thrust his hands in his coat pockets. He looks around, twice; but he\ndoesn&rsquo;t find who he was looking for. He was dejectedly making his way back\nupstairs when a sparkly sweater caught his sight quite a distance away. </p><p><i>She&rsquo;s dangerously\ntiny, </i>he thinks as he hurriedly makes his way over to her. She&rsquo;s walking at\na moderate pace, so it was easy to catch up with her.</p><p>&ldquo;Monica, wait &ndash; &ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Oh, my!&rdquo;</i> she\nscreeches, ponytail whipping around as she turns around. She is visibly white\nand shook, and Harry curses himself for his timing. She takes a few seconds to\nrecompose herself, a hand on her chest to steady her rapid heartbeat.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry. I didn&rsquo;t mean to scare you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You better be,&rdquo; she grumbles, looking up at him with\ndisdain. &ldquo;What are you doing here?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why did you leave?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Because I didn&rsquo;t like it there.

Harry was having the time of his life; Australia had been super fun and things between Lucy and him were just getting better. As Mitch had suggested, he had started asking more questions and getting to know things about her that not very many people knew. Things like her love for Wolfie, the dog her dad adopted for her when she started home-schooling; she considered him her best friend. He was actually named Wolfgang after none other than music prodigy, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, her favorite composer. That was another thing he had learned about her -and he himself was getting into- classical music. He also learned that she compiled playlists for people she knew, songs that reminded her of them for when she\u2019d miss them, he often wondered if she had one about him. These little things that he found so interesting and that made her unique in his eye were the ones swimming about in his everyday thoughts.</p><p>\tThey were on their way from Osaka to Chiba, it was a long drive and he was sitting in this little nook by a window on the bus, drawing. He was studying Lucy\u2019s face as she chatted and giggled with Clare, he smiled as he glanced down at his journal, squinting because he was trying to get the shape of her eyes just right. When he glanced up again she was looking at him, a smile on her face as she listened to what Clare was telling her about and he quickly glanced back down to his journal; he was listening to music, Mozart actually, and so he was just caught in a moment when his phone buzzed and he glanced down at it, unlocking it to see what she had said.</p><p>\tLucy:</p><p>\t\tStop staring at me, creep:)</p><p>\tHarry:</p><p>\t\tWho says I\u2019m even looking at you?</p><p>\tLucy: </p><p>\t\tYour eyes\u2026 and the direction they\u2019re looking\u2026?</p><p>\t\tI mean, I know I\u2019m cute, but geez no need to make it obvious</p><p>\tHarry chuckled as he read her response, face scrunching up all cute, that was her strategy, to look while she knew he wasn\u2019t. Lucy eagerly waited for his response.</p><p>\tHarry:\t</p><p>\t\tYeah, you are pretty cute:)</p><p>\tLucy:</p><p>\t\tI reckon you\u2019re pretty cute yourself. Anyway, I\u2019m being incredibly rude. Byeee!</p><p>\tHarry smiled down at his phone once more before getting back to his drawing. Some times glancing at her, not so obvious this time, but it seemed that she knew when he was about to look, because her eyes would flutter up and meet his every now and then, which made her blush more than him and he was the one who should be all blushy - being caught stealing glances and what not. Suddenly his moment was disturbed when Jeff sat down across from him. Harry quickly shut his journal and pushed his headphones to fall around his neck.</p><p>\t\u201cYou two are absolutely disgusting.\u201d He said through a smile and Harry chuckled.</p><p>\t\u201cThere\u2019s nothing going on.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cYet!\u201d Jeff cut in and Harry shook his head.</p><p>\t\u201cI think you should dedicate <i>Stockholm Syndrome </i>to her\u2026you always seem to be holed up in each other\u2019s rooms. Very appropriate song choice.\u201d He said and Harry giggled.</p><p>\t\u201cYou\u2019re dumb\u2026 please.\u201d He said and Jeff chuckled.</p><p>\t\u201cCan I let you in on a secret?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cShe likes you, her dad told me.\u201d Jeff said, grinning and Harry\u2019s eyes lit up, fighting hard not to glance at her. </p><p>\t\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cYeah, man. I swear! Maybe you should\u2026 make a move soon?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cMaybe\u2026 Oh, I was meaning to ask her, but it might be a sensitive topic. Where\u2019s her mum? She always talks about her dad.\u201d He said and Jeff nodded.</p><p>\t\u201cShe left them when Lucy was little. Ric doesn\u2019t talk about it much, but my mom told me that one day he got a call from the school telling him that no one came by to pick Lucy up. He was still in the UK at that point, so her aunt went to get her and she tried calling her mom but she didn\u2019t answer. When they got to their house all her things were gone and they just never heard from her again.\u201d He said quietly and Harry frowned, glancing at Lucy quickly.</p><p>\t\u201cOh wow\u2026 I can\u2019t even imagine how shitty that is.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cYeah, that\u2019s why she\u2019s so close to my mom. Her aunt, housekeeper, and my mom were pretty much the ones who helped raise her during those tough years. Her dad visited often, came back for every important thing, but when things started getting bad at her school he pulled her out and decided to move back.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cGod, it\u2019s always the best people that get fucked over.\u201d He mumbled and Jeff nodded.</p><p>\t\u201cYeah, but look at her now. It\u2019s as if nothing had ever happened.\u201d He said and Harry sighed. He glanced over to her when he saw her standing and he checked the time, it was 2 o\u2019clock; she was probably calling her dad. </p><p>\tLucy stepped into the back compartment of the bus and shut the door, dropping down onto the bed where her and Harry would lay and sighed as she dialed her dad. They talked for nearly twenty minutes without interruption, which did seem odd to her, even her dad pointed it out. They were saying their goodbyes when the door creaked open and Harry stepped in, a smile came over her face as she placed the phone down beside her and he let himself down, laying beside her.</p><p>\t\u201cMy dad was like \u201cwhere\u2019s Harry? I\u2019m so used to him interrupting?\u201d. He was very concerned.\u201d She said smiling and he smiled at her too.</p><p>\t\u201cLucy.\u201d He said and she rolled onto her side, facing him.</p><p>\t\u201cHmmm?\u201d She asked, letting her hand push back a few strands of hair that had fallen out of place.</p><p>\t\u201cI just need you to know how much you mean to me. Well, to all of us. You\u2019re one of the most talented and pretty persons I\u2019ve ever met and you\u2019re just a real gem. I\u2019m so glad you\u2019re here.\u201d He said and she smiled, a bit sadly though, her hand leaving his head and sliding under her head, giving her head some support.</p><p>\t\u201cJeff told you\u2026 about my mom?\u201d She whispered. \u201cYour whole mood changed\u2026 you guys were being very secretive, could feel you glancing towards me.\u201d She said knowingly.</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t mean to pry. I just wasn\u2019t sure how to bring it up to you.\u201d He said softly, his eyes pleading with hers for forgiveness.</p><p>\t\u201cIt\u2019s okay, m\u2019not upset. It was a long time ago; my dad and I talked about it and I get why she did it. She wasn\u2019t well\u2026 and she wasn\u2019t happy with us, so she decided to go.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d He said, his hand settled on her jaw, thumb caressing her cheek as she often did to him.</p><p>\t\u201cIt\u2019s fine, really. I forgave her a long time ago.\u201d She explained and he bit his lip. Who was this girl\u2026 she was everything he ever wanted. So pure and understanding, caring, loving\u2026. She was perfection incarnate.</p><p>\t\u201cThat\u2019s one of the things I love about you.\u201d He said and her eyes crinkled a bit when she smiled. \u201cYou\u2019re just so\u2026 I don\u2019t even know how to say it\u2026 you\u2019re just <i>you</i>. I love that.\u201d He said again, his eyes not daring to leave hers.</p><p>\t\u201cHey, new record!\u201d She said grinning and his brows furrowed in confusion.</p><p>\t\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019ve kept eye contact, this whole time.\u201d She said excitedly, her lovely smile making his heart race million miles a minute and he just surged forward and guided her face the rest of the way as he pressed his lips to hers.</p><p>\tHer eyes grew wide for a second, but soon fluttered shut at the feeling of his lips slotting against hers. The kiss made her heart burst with joy; her tummy was tingling as she attempted to pull him closer. They shuffled around until he was hovering over her, resting his weight on his forearms as he kissed on her with all the feeling he could muster up. Maybe he was reaching a bit, but it was worth the risk, he thought, as he let his tongue run against the top of her bottom lip. He smiled for a second as her arms wrapped around his neck, pulling him closer to her, it was an accident when his hips dragged against hers as he tried to decrease the distance between them, but the action made her mouth part in a little gasp and he took advantage, letting his tongue slip in and run over hers. This awakened something primal in her. Her hands ran down from around his neck and down his back, when they reached his lower back she pressed him down, causing more friction between them, Harry groaned into her mouth as he felt the bulge in his jeans growing against her. He kissed her feverishly, heart pounding in his chest because of the way her soft warm tongue felt against his. It took every ounce of self-control in him to pull back for just a second.</p><p>\t\u201cLucy, slow down.\u201d He panted and she seemed to realize what she had just done. Her eyes shot open and she bit her lip when she felt him pressed up against her thigh.</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Harry. I-if you want I can sort you out, s\u2019my fault.\u201d She said quickly and he shook his head.</p><p>\t\u201cNo, no, I\u2019ll be alright. Just figured I should stop you before you did something you weren\u2019t ready for or that you\u2019d regret later.\u201d He said pushing himself up to sit, ignoring the discomfort he felt because of the pulsating in his lower region as he helped her sit up as well.</p><p>\t\u201cThanks\u2026 again, sorry.\u201d She said, looking into his eyes and he just leaned forward, kissing her lips gently, just a quick, tiny one.</p><p>\t\u201cS\u2019alright. Quite like kissing you, love. Y\u2019taste so sweet.\u201d He said and her blood bubbled with a little bit of lust at his words. She wanted to lunge at him and also lick into his mouth and let him get away with whatever he wanted to. She would do just about anything for him. Her eyes fluttered shut at the mental images she was conjuring up.</p><p>\t\u201cPlease don\u2019t say that.\u201d She whined, her hands going to cover her face, she could feel her skin beginning to prick with the familiar tingles of arousal. Her lip was being gnawed on by her teeth, suppressing the feeling of lustful flames licking consistently at the deepest part of her core; a gentle and steady pulsing letting her know that she was turned on. She hadn\u2019t felt this type of thirst for anyone in a while.</p><p>\t\u201cM\u2019sorry.\u201d He said softly, trying to hold back a whine, because he felt it too. He knew she was fighting that animalistic need to just take whatever he was willing to give right then. His mouth actually watered as he watched her, squeezing her thighs together to relieve some of the pressure she felt. He was a grown ass man, he could control himself. His eyes clenched shut as he tried to think of the most innocent things. He wasn\u2019t going to do anything to Lucy on a fucking bus, she deserved more than that. The more he thought of it the more it helped calm him\u2026 how did he even consider that in the first place. When he peaked his eyes open she was just moving her hands away from her face, taking a deep breath and letting herself fall back onto the bed.</p><p>\t\u201cKissing you is dangerous.\u201d She said softly and he chuckled.</p><p>\t\u201cCould say the same about you.\u201d He mumbled and she shook her head in disbelief. </p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019m really sorry\u2026 I mean you know it\u2019s\u2026 been a while.\u201d She said and he nodded. She had her reasons and he respected that. \u201cJust got a bit carried away.\u201d She said, finally looking at him and he just smiled reassuringly at her.</p><p>\t\u201cS\u2019okay. We stopped in time, nothing happened. Just a pair of friends who kissed, thas\u2019all. Besides, m\u2019the one who started it. Maybe it was your fault though, you\u2019re pretty fucking tempting.\u201d He said and she chuckled.</p><p>\t\u201cLet\u2019s just drop it.\u201d She said, her eyes fluttering shut once more.</p><p>\t\u201cSorry.\u201d He said softly and she nodded. \u201cSo\u2026 what\u2019re you gonna do on your week off?\u201d He inquired, changing the subject.</p><p>\t\u201cAlready?\u201d She asked and he nodded. \u201cI hadn\u2019t even bought my ticket\u2026\u201d she mumbled. \u201cWell I suppose I\u2019ll be going home.\u201d She said quietly, \u201cI do miss my dad and Wolfie.\u201d She said of her dog and he smiled.</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019m sure they miss you like crazy, too.\u201d</p><p>-</p><p>-</p><p>-</p><p>\tThat night as she lay in her hotel bed with all the guilt and anxiety in her heart being pushed away, she got herself off. Moaning and whimpering about Harry and the things she thought about him doing to her. She was panting, suddenly feeling hot and barely alleviated from this feeling. It had even been a while since she got herself off\u2026 how would she ever even look in his eyes again after this? She had to take another shower because she was still feeling the warmth of lust tickling at her. She also managed to buy a flight, which was a great distraction, although it would be leaving half way through the show. </p><p>\tThe next morning she made sure to tell Jeff and her crew mates, who all assured her it would be fine. As they accustomed now, she saw Harry\u2019s outfit and assured him he\u2019d be amazing and had to go and pack shortly after. Right around the time the show was starting she was on her way to the airport, regretting that she didn\u2019t actually say goodbye. But she figured this distance would be good; the things she was feeling for Harry were driving her insane and she really could use a break from him.</p><p>\tWhen she landed in LAX she turned her airplane mode off and bit her lip as a text from Harry popped up on the screen and she opened it, waiting for them to allow them to disembark.</p><p>\tHarry:</p><p>\t\tYou left without saying goodbye?!?!</p><p>\t\tDespicable!</p><p>\t\tJust kidding. I hope you have a lovely time at home. Tell your dad hi for me and Wolfie, too. - H xx.</p><p>\tLucy locked her phone as she let out a sigh. She would text back, eventually\u2026 she had to think of something to say that wasn\u2019t just \u2018sorry\u2019. She snapped out of her thoughts when the person standing behind her tapped her to keep moving and with a quick muttered apology she hurried down the narrow aisle, off the plane, and into the cold airport. Naturally, her bags were some of the last to come out onto the claims carousel, so she took the time to order an Uber, and was hurrying off to the pick-up when the woman texted her that she had arrived. Then from there it was another half hour before she was being dropped off at home, the large wooden gate blocking the view of their home from the outside world and she called from the intercom.</p><p>\t\u201cYes?\u201d Her dad said and she smiled.</p><p>\t\u201cI have a delivery for Mr. Y/L/N! All the way from Japan!\u201d this is how he\u2019d announce his return home to her when she was a child.</p><p>\t\u201cSweetheart! What a surprise! Come on in!\u201d He cheered joyfully as a buzz sounded and the wood doors slowly parted. She was walking up the long drive way when her dad and Wolfie quickly came down. They were equally excited to see her.</p><p>-</p><p>-</p><p>-</p><p>\tHarry\u2019s flight was just landing in Heathrow, he checked his phone right away, he wasn\u2019t one to fret over that, but he just wanted to see if Lucy had texted him back, but she hadn\u2019t. Maybe he had done something? He worried his bottom lip between his teeth as he was let off the plane and until he got home, where his mum was waiting for him. They had a cup of tea and then she went out to breakfast with Gemma and he opted to stay in to sleep and lie around, turning on the telly to see if anything good was on. Suddenly his phone was ringing and Lucy\u2019s name was on the screen, he didn\u2019t even wait a second to pick up.</p><p>\t\u201c\u2018Lo?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cHi, sorry were you sleeping?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cNo, don\u2019t worry.\u201d He assured her.</p><p>\t\u201cSure? I asked Jeff and he told me your flight would get in in the around 8am, so I waited a bit in case you were sleeping.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cYeah, m\u2019sure. I got in like an hour ago. What are you doing up?\u201d He asked, \u201cS\u2019like past midnight for you.\u201d He said squinting at the clock on the wall.</p><p>\t\u201cI just got in bed. I forgot to text you back, got so carried away being back and everything- hold on.\u201d She said and he heard some shuffling and in a few moments she was back. \u201cSorry, Wolfie was scratching at the door, wanted to come snuggle.\u201d She whispered and he smiled.</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019d love to see him, send me a picture later, alright?\u201d He asked.</p><p>\t\u201cYeah, alright. How was the flight?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cGood, I slept most of the way through, so m\u2019not too tired, just a bit jet lagged.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cOh, I know\u2026 I\u2019m hungry for dinner and it\u2019s not even near breakfast time,\u201d she said and he chuckled. Should he say that he misses her? Because he does, a lot. \u201cI just wanted to call to say sorry for leaving abruptly, this was the only flight I could find that didn\u2019t have transfer or layover, so I took it.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cS\u2019alright. Was just a little shocked when I couldn\u2019t find you afterwards.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cBeing evasive is part of my mysteriousness as a woman, sorry.\u201d She said giggling and he followed suit, rolling his eyes a bit and turning to his side and frowning a bit when he recalled that she wasn\u2019t actually there. She wasn\u2019t even a little near; there was an entire ocean and a continent between them at the moment and he could feel it. \u201cYou know, earlier this evening as I was washing clothes I decided to listen to your last album as One Direction and I must say <i>Olivia </i>is one of the greatest pieces of music I\u2019ve heard in a long time. Everything about it screams light and joy and excitement! God, I listened to it about ten times\u2026 well done. The lyrics are beautiful, they gave me butterflies in my tummy picturing how happy you must\u2019ve been when you were inspired to write it and I just couldn\u2019t stop smiling after that.\u201d She confessed and he smiled.</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019d kill to see you smile right now.\u201d He said softly and she felt her heart flutter in her chest, his eyes grew wide at the realization of what he\u2019d actually just said and waited anxiously for a response.</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019ll make sure I\u2019m in the picture with Wolfie then.\u201d She said and he chuckled.</p><p>\t\u201cOkay, you already said it.\u201d </p><p>\t\u201cIt\u2019s gonna be a long week.\u201d She said quietly and he hummed, letting his eyes close for a moment.</p><p>\t\u201cYeah\u2026 but enjoy this time with your dad, yeah? He must be thrilled to have you home.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cHe is, he cried when he saw me. I cried a little too, I missed him a lot.\u201d She yawned and he frowned, she was tired, and as much as he wanted to keep talking to her, he should let her go.</p><p>\t\u201cHey, get some sleep fo\u2019 me, love. We\u2019ll see each other real soon alright?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cYeah.\u201d She said quietly.</p><p>\t\u201cAnd if you really, really miss me you can always call. But I\u2019d prefer you didn\u2019t.\u201d He said smiling.</p><p>\t\u201cWhy not?\u201d She frowned, scratching between Wolfie\u2019s ears when he laid his head on her tummy.</p><p>\t\u201cBecause if you don\u2019t it\u2019ll be even more exciting when we see each other again. Absence makes the heart grow fonder\u2026 or at least that\u2019s what they say.\u201d He said.</p><p>\t\u201cDon\u2019t see how I could be any more fond than I am now.\u201d She said softly before yawning once more and literally his heart skipped a beat at her sleepy confession. \u201cGood night, H.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cG\u2019night, Lucy.\u201d He smiled.</p><p>\t\u201cOh almost forgot!\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cMwah!\u201d She made a little kissy noise and he blushed, face beet red, \u201cShould last you the week.\u201d She giggled and before he could say anything the line went dead. He couldn\u2019t wait for the week to be over.</p><p>-</p><p>-</p><p>-</p><p>\tLucy woke up to Wolfie barking angrily out the window, she groaned as she turned over, burying her head in the pillow. She had only been home three days and already there was commotion.</p><p>\t\u201cWolfie, please\u2026 Shhhh!\u201d She shushed and the dog whined before jumping onto the bed. She could faintly hear shouting. She sat up, perking her ears up and eyes growing wide at the familiar voice growing closer and closer. She rushed out of bed and Wolfie shot after her like a bullet and she hurried out to the entrance, squinting and seeing none other than Ezra, storming up the drive way with her dad hot on his trail, demanding that he get off his property.</p><p>\t\u201cLucy!\u201d He said when he saw her, running up to where she was standing, her eyes welled up at the image of him. God, he was beautiful, but he had hurt her so much. Wolfie was barking and her dad was shouting at him to stay back, and Ezra was pleading with her, it was a fucking mess.</p><p>\t\u201cDon\u2019t you dare touch my daughter!\u201d Her dad shouted, standing between them, pushing him back as Ezra reached out to her.</p><p>\t\u201cDad, s\u2019alright. I think we need to have a talk.\u201d She said softly and he looked back at her with wild eyes. Wolfie took a sniff at him and calmed when he recognized the scent.</p><p>\t\u201cI told you!\u201d Ezra said, standing with more confidence.</p><p>\t\u201cCall for me if you need me, I\u2019ll be right inside.\u201d Her dad said before he called Wolfie back inside and she sat on the steps to that led to the porch, sighing and he followed suit.</p><p>\t\u201cHow\u2019d you get in?\u201d She asked.</p><p>\t\u201cSaid it was a package for you\u2026\u201d he said before chuckling and Lucy managed a giggle despite the ache in her chest. She was feeling it more now that Harry wasn\u2019t nearby and that the one who caused her all the pain was right beside her, she could feel the warmth of his skin radiating onto her bare arms.</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019ve told him he should get a camera\u2026 he\u2019s a gullible guy.\u201d She said and he chuckled. Her breath hitched in her throat when his hand landed on hers and squeezed over it.</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019m sorry for everything I said before. I love you.\u201d He said, searching in her eyes for a response, but she just pulled her hand away, it didn\u2019t feel like Harry\u2019s. \u201cI know I fucked up, but I need you. I really do love you and I\u2019ve been going insane without you.\u201d He said and she sighed.</p><p>\t\u201cWe don\u2019t work, Ezra. It may have been a while back, but the things you did\u2026 I can\u2019t trust you and you never did a good job of earning it back. Besides, I\u2019m so much busier now and have a million things to do when this tour ends, it\u2019s impossible.\u201d She said and he shook his head as she stood, ready to end the conversation, he did the same.</p><p>\t\u201cBabe, come on.\u201d He pleaded.</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019m not your babe or anything anymore. Thanks for coming and saying sorry, but I don\u2019t\u2026 love you anymore.\u201d She said softly and his eyes narrowed.</p><p>\t\u201cAre you with someone else?\u201d He bellowed.</p><p>\t\u201cNo! I\u2019m just over this!\u201d She signaled between them. \u201cI\u2019m not the fucking cheater here!\u201d She argued back, not afraid to stand up for herself anymore, she didn\u2019t need this. She didn\u2019t deserve <i>this</i>. </p><p>\t\u201cTell me you don\u2019t miss this.\u201d He said taking her hands, gripping them tight, she couldn\u2019t pull back. \u201cOr this\u2026\u201d he said wrapping his arms around her and pulling her in, pressing his lips to hers, she thrashed her head around, hating the feeling of his lips on hers, tears ran down her face as she tried to pull back because it wasn\u2019t Harry.</p><p>\t\u201cGet the fuck away from my daughter, you son of a bitch!\u201d Her dad burst through the door with a broom, he was caught off guard for a moment and she shoved him away, wiping her mouth on the back of her hand. </p><p>\t\u201cPlease, just go and don\u2019t contact me again. We\u2019re done, Ezra.\u201d She stated flatly and he shook his head before flipping them off.</p><p>\t\u201cGet him out!\u201d Her dad shouted to Wolfie and Wolfie chased him down the long drive way until he was out the gate. Lucy\u2019s dad jumped, startled as she burst into laughter through her tears, trying to catch her breath, wheezing and he started laughing, too.</p><p>\t\u201cWhat is it?\u201d He asked between fits and she shook her head, wiping a tear from her eye as she caught her breath.</p><p>\t\u201cYou came out with a freaking broom!\u201d She said hugging him tight as they laughed again.</p><p>\t\u201cI don\u2019t have a gun!\u201d He said laughing and she shook her head. \u201cGet inside, I was in the middle of making pancakes when this asshole showed up, probably all cold by now.\u201d He complained.</p><p>\tThat was the highlight of her week and it was killing her not to call Harry and tell him the story, but she was trying her best to wait. The week was almost over, and although she was sad to be leaving her dad again, she would be seeing Harry soon.</p><p>-</p><p>-</p><p>-</p><p>\tTo say that the rest of the week flew by was an understatement; Lucy was anxious to see Harry. As he had suggested, they didn\u2019t talk all week except for the picture she promised him of herself with Wolfie, her lovable doberman. Her flight would be landing earlier than the bands because as part of the roadie crew, she had to go and set up the arena. She had arrived two days before the show, they spent part of that afternoon and a large part of the next day setting up in the arena. Lucy spent the evening before the show in her hotel room reading. She knew they\u2019d be arriving tonight, she wasn\u2019t exactly sure at what time, but when it hit 9pm she got ready for bed and dimmed the lights, just a bit disappointed they hadn\u2019t arrived yet. She continued reading until the words started blurring together and the lines started shifting on the page and finally until she just couldn\u2019t keep her eyes open anymore.</p><p>\tLucy groaned at the familiar sound of her phone ringing, she reached for it on the night stand, answering quickly.</p><p>\t\u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019ve got a surprise for you.\u201d The familiar voice said and she shot up, her heart hammering in her chest at Harry\u2019s voice. </p><p>\t\u201cHarry?\u201d She asked into a yawn and he chuckled.</p><p>\t\u201cYeah, s\u2019me! Come to your door!\u201d He urged.</p><p>\t\u201cOkay, m\u2019coming!\u201d She chirped excitedly.</p><p>\tShe hurried to the bathroom and gargled some mouth wash as fast as she could, which woke her up enough and bolted for the door. When she turned it open and saw him standing there it felt like her heart was going to beat out of her chest as they beamed at each other. Her skin was buzzing, itching to touch his skin. He practically charged her, hugging around her waist and picking her up, stepping past the door and kicking it closed as his lips found hers easily, despite the dark. He was overwhelmed with joy and warmth at the feeling of her in his arms. Her lips were nice and soft for him, eagerly opening up as he dipped his tongue into her mouth and tasted her after what had seemed like ages. He groaned at the way she was sweet on his tongue and how her hands wove into the hair at the back of his head, carding through it gently. She pulled back to take a breath and pressed a quick kiss at the corner of his mouth, panting as she burrowed herself in his neck, loving his familiar scent.</p><p>\t\u201cI missed you so much.\u201d She mumbled into his throat, his heart pumping faster when she kissed him right under his jaw, just one little kiss, but it did things to him.</p><p>\t\u201cMe too, love. Now, let me show you your surprise.\u201d He said letting her down and she grinned up at him, taking his hand and pulling him to the bed, the dim lamp still giving the room a nice glow. She took a seat on the bed as he pulled his journal out from his bag before setting it down. He couldn\u2019t stop smiling and neither could she, she was buzzing with excitement.</p><p>\t\u201cWhat is it?\u201d She asked impatiently and he chuckled, opening the cover.</p><p>\t\u201cIn my hands, I have for you the original journal entry of the lyrics for <i>Olivia.</i>\u201d Her eyes grew wide as he pulled out a loose page from right inside the cover.</p><p>\t\u201cNo way.\u201d She asked in disbelief, mouth dropping open, eyes going wide.</p><p>\t\u201cYes way.\u201d He said smiling, relishing in her reaction, he wanted to kiss her all over again. \u201cI had to go through about six of my journals to find it.\u201d He said as he handed the page to her and she took it gently, her eyes going soft as she looked over his handwriting.\t</p><p>\t\u201cBut why? This is so special, Harry. You didn\u2019t have to.\u201d She nearly whispered, looking up into his eyes and he shrugged, a smile making its way onto his face.</p><p>\t\u201cBecause you loved the song and I knew that when I got to see you after the break I would be just as happy as I was when I wrote this song. Well actually, I think I\u2019m happier now that I\u2019m here with you.\u201d He said and her heart just about melted as she looked down at the page again. There were scribbles in the margins about instrumentation and little doodles of butterflies and flowers\u2026it was so perfectly <i>him.</i></p><p>\t\u201cThat\u2019s another thing I love about you\u2026 your art.\u201d She said glancing back up into his eyes, \u201cIt\u2019s probably my favorite thing about you.\u201d She confessed and he felt his heart racing as fast as the speed of light. He was melted butter with her words, he felt loved and important, and cherished. He held her face in his hands as he pressed his lips to hers once more. This time it wasn\u2019t as rushed, it was meaningful and emotional. \u201cWait, wait, wait, wait.\u201d She mumbled against his lips.</p><p>\t\u201cHmmm?\u201d He asked, pulling back.\t</p><p>\t\u201cNeed t\u2019put this somewhere safe!\u201d She said of the little page in her hands and he smiled. She hurried to her luggage and pulled out her lap top; he watched as she pulled it out of the case and set it on the bed, popping off the bottom cover and neatly laying the page there before settling the laptop back into the cover and then putting it away again. She walked back over to him and just hugged him to her, his head resting on her chest and she pulled back. \u201cThank you. S\u2019the best gift I\u2019ve ever received.\u201d She said and he smiled nuzzling back into her. \u201cAre you ready for bed?\u201d She asked and he shook his head. \u201cDo that, yeah? Then we can snuggle. I have thee funniest story to tell you\u2026 I almost called you over the break just to tell you.\u201d She said and he grinned.</p><p>\t\u201cCan\u2019t wait.\u201d</p>",

Harry was having the time of his life; Australia had been super fun and things between Lucy and him were just getting better. As Mitch had suggested, he had started asking more questions and getting to know things about her that not very many people knew. Things like her love for Wolfie, the dog her dad adopted for her when she started home-schooling; she considered him her best friend. He was actually named Wolfgang after none other than music prodigy, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, her favorite composer. That was another thing he had learned about her -and he himself was getting into- classical music. He also learned that she compiled playlists for people she knew, songs that reminded her of them for when she\u2019d miss them, he often wondered if she had one about him. These little things that he found so interesting and that made her unique in his eye were the ones swimming about in his everyday thoughts.</p><p>\tThey were on their way from Osaka to Chiba, it was a long drive and he was sitting in this little nook by a window on the bus, drawing. He was studying Lucy\u2019s face as she chatted and giggled with Clare, he smiled as he glanced down at his journal, squinting because he was trying to get the shape of her eyes just right. When he glanced up again she was looking at him, a smile on her face as she listened to what Clare was telling her about and he quickly glanced back down to his journal; he was listening to music, Mozart actually, and so he was just caught in a moment when his phone buzzed and he glanced down at it, unlocking it to see what she had said.</p><p>\tLucy:</p><p>\t\tStop staring at me, creep:)</p><p>\tHarry:</p><p>\t\tWho says I\u2019m even looking at you?</p><p>\tLucy: </p><p>\t\tYour eyes\u2026 and the direction they\u2019re looking\u2026?</p><p>\t\tI mean, I know I\u2019m cute, but geez no need to make it obvious</p><p>\tHarry chuckled as he read her response, face scrunching up all cute, that was her strategy, to look while she knew he wasn\u2019t. Lucy eagerly waited for his response.</p><p>\tHarry:\t</p><p>\t\tYeah, you are pretty cute:)</p><p>\tLucy:</p><p>\t\tI reckon you\u2019re pretty cute yourself. Anyway, I\u2019m being incredibly rude. Byeee!</p><p>\tHarry smiled down at his phone once more before getting back to his drawing. Some times glancing at her, not so obvious this time, but it seemed that she knew when he was about to look, because her eyes would flutter up and meet his every now and then, which made her blush more than him and he was the one who should be all blushy - being caught stealing glances and what not. Suddenly his moment was disturbed when Jeff sat down across from him. Harry quickly shut his journal and pushed his headphones to fall around his neck.</p><p>\t\u201cYou two are absolutely disgusting.\u201d He said through a smile and Harry chuckled.</p><p>\t\u201cThere\u2019s nothing going on.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cYet!\u201d Jeff cut in and Harry shook his head.</p><p>\t\u201cI think you should dedicate <i>Stockholm Syndrome </i>to her\u2026you always seem to be holed up in each other\u2019s rooms. Very appropriate song choice.\u201d He said and Harry giggled.</p><p>\t\u201cYou\u2019re dumb\u2026 please.\u201d He said and Jeff chuckled.</p><p>\t\u201cCan I let you in on a secret?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cShe likes you, her dad told me.\u201d Jeff said, grinning and Harry\u2019s eyes lit up, fighting hard not to glance at her. </p><p>\t\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cYeah, man. I swear! Maybe you should\u2026 make a move soon?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cMaybe\u2026 Oh, I was meaning to ask her, but it might be a sensitive topic. Where\u2019s her mum? She always talks about her dad.\u201d He said and Jeff nodded.</p><p>\t\u201cShe left them when Lucy was little. Ric doesn\u2019t talk about it much, but my mom told me that one day he got a call from the school telling him that no one came by to pick Lucy up. He was still in the UK at that point, so her aunt went to get her and she tried calling her mom but she didn\u2019t answer. When they got to their house all her things were gone and they just never heard from her again.\u201d He said quietly and Harry frowned, glancing at Lucy quickly.</p><p>\t\u201cOh wow\u2026 I can\u2019t even imagine how shitty that is.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cYeah, that\u2019s why she\u2019s so close to my mom. Her aunt, housekeeper, and my mom were pretty much the ones who helped raise her during those tough years. Her dad visited often, came back for every important thing, but when things started getting bad at her school he pulled her out and decided to move back.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cGod, it\u2019s always the best people that get fucked over.\u201d He mumbled and Jeff nodded.</p><p>\t\u201cYeah, but look at her now. It\u2019s as if nothing had ever happened.\u201d He said and Harry sighed. He glanced over to her when he saw her standing and he checked the time, it was 2 o\u2019clock; she was probably calling her dad. </p><p>\tLucy stepped into the back compartment of the bus and shut the door, dropping down onto the bed where her and Harry would lay and sighed as she dialed her dad. They talked for nearly twenty minutes without interruption, which did seem odd to her, even her dad pointed it out. They were saying their goodbyes when the door creaked open and Harry stepped in, a smile came over her face as she placed the phone down beside her and he let himself down, laying beside her.</p><p>\t\u201cMy dad was like \u201cwhere\u2019s Harry? I\u2019m so used to him interrupting?\u201d. He was very concerned.\u201d She said smiling and he smiled at her too.</p><p>\t\u201cLucy.\u201d He said and she rolled onto her side, facing him.</p><p>\t\u201cHmmm?\u201d She asked, letting her hand push back a few strands of hair that had fallen out of place.</p><p>\t\u201cI just need you to know how much you mean to me. Well, to all of us. You\u2019re one of the most talented and pretty persons I\u2019ve ever met and you\u2019re just a real gem. I\u2019m so glad you\u2019re here.\u201d He said and she smiled, a bit sadly though, her hand leaving his head and sliding under her head, giving her head some support.</p><p>\t\u201cJeff told you\u2026 about my mom?\u201d She whispered. \u201cYour whole mood changed\u2026 you guys were being very secretive, could feel you glancing towards me.\u201d She said knowingly.</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t mean to pry. I just wasn\u2019t sure how to bring it up to you.\u201d He said softly, his eyes pleading with hers for forgiveness.</p><p>\t\u201cIt\u2019s okay, m\u2019not upset. It was a long time ago; my dad and I talked about it and I get why she did it. She wasn\u2019t well\u2026 and she wasn\u2019t happy with us, so she decided to go.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d He said, his hand settled on her jaw, thumb caressing her cheek as she often did to him.</p><p>\t\u201cIt\u2019s fine, really. I forgave her a long time ago.\u201d She explained and he bit his lip. Who was this girl\u2026 she was everything he ever wanted. So pure and understanding, caring, loving\u2026. She was perfection incarnate.</p><p>\t\u201cThat\u2019s one of the things I love about you.\u201d He said and her eyes crinkled a bit when she smiled. \u201cYou\u2019re just so\u2026 I don\u2019t even know how to say it\u2026 you\u2019re just <i>you</i>. I love that.\u201d He said again, his eyes not daring to leave hers.</p><p>\t\u201cHey, new record!\u201d She said grinning and his brows furrowed in confusion.</p><p>\t\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019ve kept eye contact, this whole time.\u201d She said excitedly, her lovely smile making his heart race million miles a minute and he just surged forward and guided her face the rest of the way as he pressed his lips to hers.</p><p>\tHer eyes grew wide for a second, but soon fluttered shut at the feeling of his lips slotting against hers. The kiss made her heart burst with joy; her tummy was tingling as she attempted to pull him closer. They shuffled around until he was hovering over her, resting his weight on his forearms as he kissed on her with all the feeling he could muster up. Maybe he was reaching a bit, but it was worth the risk, he thought, as he let his tongue run against the top of her bottom lip. He smiled for a second as her arms wrapped around his neck, pulling him closer to her, it was an accident when his hips dragged against hers as he tried to decrease the distance between them, but the action made her mouth part in a little gasp and he took advantage, letting his tongue slip in and run over hers. This awakened something primal in her. Her hands ran down from around his neck and down his back, when they reached his lower back she pressed him down, causing more friction between them, Harry groaned into her mouth as he felt the bulge in his jeans growing against her. He kissed her feverishly, heart pounding in his chest because of the way her soft warm tongue felt against his. It took every ounce of self-control in him to pull back for just a second.</p><p>\t\u201cLucy, slow down.\u201d He panted and she seemed to realize what she had just done. Her eyes shot open and she bit her lip when she felt him pressed up against her thigh.</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Harry. I-if you want I can sort you out, s\u2019my fault.\u201d She said quickly and he shook his head.</p><p>\t\u201cNo, no, I\u2019ll be alright. Just figured I should stop you before you did something you weren\u2019t ready for or that you\u2019d regret later.\u201d He said pushing himself up to sit, ignoring the discomfort he felt because of the pulsating in his lower region as he helped her sit up as well.</p><p>\t\u201cThanks\u2026 again, sorry.\u201d She said, looking into his eyes and he just leaned forward, kissing her lips gently, just a quick, tiny one.</p><p>\t\u201cS\u2019alright. Quite like kissing you, love. Y\u2019taste so sweet.\u201d He said and her blood bubbled with a little bit of lust at his words. She wanted to lunge at him and also lick into his mouth and let him get away with whatever he wanted to. She would do just about anything for him. Her eyes fluttered shut at the mental images she was conjuring up.</p><p>\t\u201cPlease don\u2019t say that.\u201d She whined, her hands going to cover her face, she could feel her skin beginning to prick with the familiar tingles of arousal. Her lip was being gnawed on by her teeth, suppressing the feeling of lustful flames licking consistently at the deepest part of her core; a gentle and steady pulsing letting her know that she was turned on. She hadn\u2019t felt this type of thirst for anyone in a while.</p><p>\t\u201cM\u2019sorry.\u201d He said softly, trying to hold back a whine, because he felt it too. He knew she was fighting that animalistic need to just take whatever he was willing to give right then. His mouth actually watered as he watched her, squeezing her thighs together to relieve some of the pressure she felt. He was a grown ass man, he could control himself. His eyes clenched shut as he tried to think of the most innocent things. He wasn\u2019t going to do anything to Lucy on a fucking bus, she deserved more than that. The more he thought of it the more it helped calm him\u2026 how did he even consider that in the first place. When he peaked his eyes open she was just moving her hands away from her face, taking a deep breath and letting herself fall back onto the bed.</p><p>\t\u201cKissing you is dangerous.\u201d She said softly and he chuckled.</p><p>\t\u201cCould say the same about you.\u201d He mumbled and she shook her head in disbelief. </p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019m really sorry\u2026 I mean you know it\u2019s\u2026 been a while.\u201d She said and he nodded. She had her reasons and he respected that. \u201cJust got a bit carried away.\u201d She said, finally looking at him and he just smiled reassuringly at her.</p><p>\t\u201cS\u2019okay. We stopped in time, nothing happened. Just a pair of friends who kissed, thas\u2019all. Besides, m\u2019the one who started it. Maybe it was your fault though, you\u2019re pretty fucking tempting.\u201d He said and she chuckled.</p><p>\t\u201cLet\u2019s just drop it.\u201d She said, her eyes fluttering shut once more.</p><p>\t\u201cSorry.\u201d He said softly and she nodded. \u201cSo\u2026 what\u2019re you gonna do on your week off?\u201d He inquired, changing the subject.</p><p>\t\u201cAlready?\u201d She asked and he nodded. \u201cI hadn\u2019t even bought my ticket\u2026\u201d she mumbled. \u201cWell I suppose I\u2019ll be going home.\u201d She said quietly, \u201cI do miss my dad and Wolfie.\u201d She said of her dog and he smiled.</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019m sure they miss you like crazy, too.\u201d</p><p>-</p><p>-</p><p>-</p><p>\tThat night as she lay in her hotel bed with all the guilt and anxiety in her heart being pushed away, she got herself off. Moaning and whimpering about Harry and the things she thought about him doing to her. She was panting, suddenly feeling hot and barely alleviated from this feeling. It had even been a while since she got herself off\u2026 how would she ever even look in his eyes again after this? She had to take another shower because she was still feeling the warmth of lust tickling at her. She also managed to buy a flight, which was a great distraction, although it would be leaving half way through the show. </p><p>\tThe next morning she made sure to tell Jeff and her crew mates, who all assured her it would be fine. As they accustomed now, she saw Harry\u2019s outfit and assured him he\u2019d be amazing and had to go and pack shortly after. Right around the time the show was starting she was on her way to the airport, regretting that she didn\u2019t actually say goodbye. But she figured this distance would be good; the things she was feeling for Harry were driving her insane and she really could use a break from him.</p><p>\tWhen she landed in LAX she turned her airplane mode off and bit her lip as a text from Harry popped up on the screen and she opened it, waiting for them to allow them to disembark.</p><p>\tHarry:</p><p>\t\tYou left without saying goodbye?!?!</p><p>\t\tDespicable!</p><p>\t\tJust kidding. I hope you have a lovely time at home. Tell your dad hi for me and Wolfie, too. - H xx.</p><p>\tLucy locked her phone as she let out a sigh. She would text back, eventually\u2026 she had to think of something to say that wasn\u2019t just \u2018sorry\u2019. She snapped out of her thoughts when the person standing behind her tapped her to keep moving and with a quick muttered apology she hurried down the narrow aisle, off the plane, and into the cold airport. Naturally, her bags were some of the last to come out onto the claims carousel, so she took the time to order an Uber, and was hurrying off to the pick-up when the woman texted her that she had arrived. Then from there it was another half hour before she was being dropped off at home, the large wooden gate blocking the view of their home from the outside world and she called from the intercom.</p><p>\t\u201cYes?\u201d Her dad said and she smiled.</p><p>\t\u201cI have a delivery for Mr. Y/L/N! All the way from Japan!\u201d this is how he\u2019d announce his return home to her when she was a child.</p><p>\t\u201cSweetheart! What a surprise! Come on in!\u201d He cheered joyfully as a buzz sounded and the wood doors slowly parted. She was walking up the long drive way when her dad and Wolfie quickly came down. They were equally excited to see her.</p><p>-</p><p>-</p><p>-</p><p>\tHarry\u2019s flight was just landing in Heathrow, he checked his phone right away, he wasn\u2019t one to fret over that, but he just wanted to see if Lucy had texted him back, but she hadn\u2019t. Maybe he had done something? He worried his bottom lip between his teeth as he was let off the plane and until he got home, where his mum was waiting for him. They had a cup of tea and then she went out to breakfast with Gemma and he opted to stay in to sleep and lie around, turning on the telly to see if anything good was on. Suddenly his phone was ringing and Lucy\u2019s name was on the screen, he didn\u2019t even wait a second to pick up.</p><p>\t\u201c\u2018Lo?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cHi, sorry were you sleeping?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cNo, don\u2019t worry.\u201d He assured her.</p><p>\t\u201cSure? I asked Jeff and he told me your flight would get in in the around 8am, so I waited a bit in case you were sleeping.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cYeah, m\u2019sure. I got in like an hour ago. What are you doing up?\u201d He asked, \u201cS\u2019like past midnight for you.\u201d He said squinting at the clock on the wall.</p><p>\t\u201cI just got in bed. I forgot to text you back, got so carried away being back and everything- hold on.\u201d She said and he heard some shuffling and in a few moments she was back. \u201cSorry, Wolfie was scratching at the door, wanted to come snuggle.\u201d She whispered and he smiled.</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019d love to see him, send me a picture later, alright?\u201d He asked.</p><p>\t\u201cYeah, alright. How was the flight?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cGood, I slept most of the way through, so m\u2019not too tired, just a bit jet lagged.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cOh, I know\u2026 I\u2019m hungry for dinner and it\u2019s not even near breakfast time,\u201d she said and he chuckled. Should he say that he misses her? Because he does, a lot. \u201cI just wanted to call to say sorry for leaving abruptly, this was the only flight I could find that didn\u2019t have transfer or layover, so I took it.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cS\u2019alright. Was just a little shocked when I couldn\u2019t find you afterwards.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cBeing evasive is part of my mysteriousness as a woman, sorry.\u201d She said giggling and he followed suit, rolling his eyes a bit and turning to his side and frowning a bit when he recalled that she wasn\u2019t actually there. She wasn\u2019t even a little near; there was an entire ocean and a continent between them at the moment and he could feel it. \u201cYou know, earlier this evening as I was washing clothes I decided to listen to your last album as One Direction and I must say <i>Olivia </i>is one of the greatest pieces of music I\u2019ve heard in a long time. Everything about it screams light and joy and excitement! God, I listened to it about ten times\u2026 well done. The lyrics are beautiful, they gave me butterflies in my tummy picturing how happy you must\u2019ve been when you were inspired to write it and I just couldn\u2019t stop smiling after that.\u201d She confessed and he smiled.</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019d kill to see you smile right now.\u201d He said softly and she felt her heart flutter in her chest, his eyes grew wide at the realization of what he\u2019d actually just said and waited anxiously for a response.</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019ll make sure I\u2019m in the picture with Wolfie then.\u201d She said and he chuckled.</p><p>\t\u201cOkay, you already said it.\u201d </p><p>\t\u201cIt\u2019s gonna be a long week.\u201d She said quietly and he hummed, letting his eyes close for a moment.</p><p>\t\u201cYeah\u2026 but enjoy this time with your dad, yeah? He must be thrilled to have you home.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cHe is, he cried when he saw me. I cried a little too, I missed him a lot.\u201d She yawned and he frowned, she was tired, and as much as he wanted to keep talking to her, he should let her go.</p><p>\t\u201cHey, get some sleep fo\u2019 me, love. We\u2019ll see each other real soon alright?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cYeah.\u201d She said quietly.</p><p>\t\u201cAnd if you really, really miss me you can always call. But I\u2019d prefer you didn\u2019t.\u201d He said smiling.</p><p>\t\u201cWhy not?\u201d She frowned, scratching between Wolfie\u2019s ears when he laid his head on her tummy.</p><p>\t\u201cBecause if you don\u2019t it\u2019ll be even more exciting when we see each other again. Absence makes the heart grow fonder\u2026 or at least that\u2019s what they say.\u201d He said.</p><p>\t\u201cDon\u2019t see how I could be any more fond than I am now.\u201d She said softly before yawning once more and literally his heart skipped a beat at her sleepy confession. \u201cGood night, H.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cG\u2019night, Lucy.\u201d He smiled.</p><p>\t\u201cOh almost forgot!\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cMwah!\u201d She made a little kissy noise and he blushed, face beet red, \u201cShould last you the week.\u201d She giggled and before he could say anything the line went dead. He couldn\u2019t wait for the week to be over.</p><p>-</p><p>-</p><p>-</p><p>\tLucy woke up to Wolfie barking angrily out the window, she groaned as she turned over, burying her head in the pillow. She had only been home three days and already there was commotion.</p><p>\t\u201cWolfie, please\u2026 Shhhh!\u201d She shushed and the dog whined before jumping onto the bed. She could faintly hear shouting. She sat up, perking her ears up and eyes growing wide at the familiar voice growing closer and closer. She rushed out of bed and Wolfie shot after her like a bullet and she hurried out to the entrance, squinting and seeing none other than Ezra, storming up the drive way with her dad hot on his trail, demanding that he get off his property.</p><p>\t\u201cLucy!\u201d He said when he saw her, running up to where she was standing, her eyes welled up at the image of him. God, he was beautiful, but he had hurt her so much. Wolfie was barking and her dad was shouting at him to stay back, and Ezra was pleading with her, it was a fucking mess.</p><p>\t\u201cDon\u2019t you dare touch my daughter!\u201d Her dad shouted, standing between them, pushing him back as Ezra reached out to her.</p><p>\t\u201cDad, s\u2019alright. I think we need to have a talk.\u201d She said softly and he looked back at her with wild eyes. Wolfie took a sniff at him and calmed when he recognized the scent.</p><p>\t\u201cI told you!\u201d Ezra said, standing with more confidence.</p><p>\t\u201cCall for me if you need me, I\u2019ll be right inside.\u201d Her dad said before he called Wolfie back inside and she sat on the steps to that led to the porch, sighing and he followed suit.</p><p>\t\u201cHow\u2019d you get in?\u201d She asked.</p><p>\t\u201cSaid it was a package for you\u2026\u201d he said before chuckling and Lucy managed a giggle despite the ache in her chest. She was feeling it more now that Harry wasn\u2019t nearby and that the one who caused her all the pain was right beside her, she could feel the warmth of his skin radiating onto her bare arms.</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019ve told him he should get a camera\u2026 he\u2019s a gullible guy.\u201d She said and he chuckled. Her breath hitched in her throat when his hand landed on hers and squeezed over it.</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019m sorry for everything I said before. I love you.\u201d He said, searching in her eyes for a response, but she just pulled her hand away, it didn\u2019t feel like Harry\u2019s. \u201cI know I fucked up, but I need you. I really do love you and I\u2019ve been going insane without you.\u201d He said and she sighed.</p><p>\t\u201cWe don\u2019t work, Ezra. It may have been a while back, but the things you did\u2026 I can\u2019t trust you and you never did a good job of earning it back. Besides, I\u2019m so much busier now and have a million things to do when this tour ends, it\u2019s impossible.\u201d She said and he shook his head as she stood, ready to end the conversation, he did the same.</p><p>\t\u201cBabe, come on.\u201d He pleaded.</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019m not your babe or anything anymore. Thanks for coming and saying sorry, but I don\u2019t\u2026 love you anymore.\u201d She said softly and his eyes narrowed.</p><p>\t\u201cAre you with someone else?\u201d He bellowed.</p><p>\t\u201cNo! I\u2019m just over this!\u201d She signaled between them. \u201cI\u2019m not the fucking cheater here!\u201d She argued back, not afraid to stand up for herself anymore, she didn\u2019t need this. She didn\u2019t deserve <i>this</i>. </p><p>\t\u201cTell me you don\u2019t miss this.\u201d He said taking her hands, gripping them tight, she couldn\u2019t pull back. \u201cOr this\u2026\u201d he said wrapping his arms around her and pulling her in, pressing his lips to hers, she thrashed her head around, hating the feeling of his lips on hers, tears ran down her face as she tried to pull back because it wasn\u2019t Harry.</p><p>\t\u201cGet the fuck away from my daughter, you son of a bitch!\u201d Her dad burst through the door with a broom, he was caught off guard for a moment and she shoved him away, wiping her mouth on the back of her hand. </p><p>\t\u201cPlease, just go and don\u2019t contact me again. We\u2019re done, Ezra.\u201d She stated flatly and he shook his head before flipping them off.</p><p>\t\u201cGet him out!\u201d Her dad shouted to Wolfie and Wolfie chased him down the long drive way until he was out the gate. Lucy\u2019s dad jumped, startled as she burst into laughter through her tears, trying to catch her breath, wheezing and he started laughing, too.</p><p>\t\u201cWhat is it?\u201d He asked between fits and she shook her head, wiping a tear from her eye as she caught her breath.</p><p>\t\u201cYou came out with a freaking broom!\u201d She said hugging him tight as they laughed again.</p><p>\t\u201cI don\u2019t have a gun!\u201d He said laughing and she shook her head. \u201cGet inside, I was in the middle of making pancakes when this asshole showed up, probably all cold by now.\u201d He complained.</p><p>\tThat was the highlight of her week and it was killing her not to call Harry and tell him the story, but she was trying her best to wait. The week was almost over, and although she was sad to be leaving her dad again, she would be seeing Harry soon.</p><p>-</p><p>-</p><p>-</p><p>\tTo say that the rest of the week flew by was an understatement; Lucy was anxious to see Harry. As he had suggested, they didn\u2019t talk all week except for the picture she promised him of herself with Wolfie, her lovable doberman. Her flight would be landing earlier than the bands because as part of the roadie crew, she had to go and set up the arena. She had arrived two days before the show, they spent part of that afternoon and a large part of the next day setting up in the arena. Lucy spent the evening before the show in her hotel room reading. She knew they\u2019d be arriving tonight, she wasn\u2019t exactly sure at what time, but when it hit 9pm she got ready for bed and dimmed the lights, just a bit disappointed they hadn\u2019t arrived yet. She continued reading until the words started blurring together and the lines started shifting on the page and finally until she just couldn\u2019t keep her eyes open anymore.</p><p>\tLucy groaned at the familiar sound of her phone ringing, she reached for it on the night stand, answering quickly.</p><p>\t\u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019ve got a surprise for you.\u201d The familiar voice said and she shot up, her heart hammering in her chest at Harry\u2019s voice. </p><p>\t\u201cHarry?\u201d She asked into a yawn and he chuckled.</p><p>\t\u201cYeah, s\u2019me! Come to your door!\u201d He urged.</p><p>\t\u201cOkay, m\u2019coming!\u201d She chirped excitedly.</p><p>\tShe hurried to the bathroom and gargled some mouth wash as fast as she could, which woke her up enough and bolted for the door. When she turned it open and saw him standing there it felt like her heart was going to beat out of her chest as they beamed at each other. Her skin was buzzing, itching to touch his skin. He practically charged her, hugging around her waist and picking her up, stepping past the door and kicking it closed as his lips found hers easily, despite the dark. He was overwhelmed with joy and warmth at the feeling of her in his arms. Her lips were nice and soft for him, eagerly opening up as he dipped his tongue into her mouth and tasted her after what had seemed like ages. He groaned at the way she was sweet on his tongue and how her hands wove into the hair at the back of his head, carding through it gently. She pulled back to take a breath and pressed a quick kiss at the corner of his mouth, panting as she burrowed herself in his neck, loving his familiar scent.</p><p>\t\u201cI missed you so much.\u201d She mumbled into his throat, his heart pumping faster when she kissed him right under his jaw, just one little kiss, but it did things to him.</p><p>\t\u201cMe too, love. Now, let me show you your surprise.\u201d He said letting her down and she grinned up at him, taking his hand and pulling him to the bed, the dim lamp still giving the room a nice glow. She took a seat on the bed as he pulled his journal out from his bag before setting it down. He couldn\u2019t stop smiling and neither could she, she was buzzing with excitement.</p><p>\t\u201cWhat is it?\u201d She asked impatiently and he chuckled, opening the cover.</p><p>\t\u201cIn my hands, I have for you the original journal entry of the lyrics for <i>Olivia.</i>\u201d Her eyes grew wide as he pulled out a loose page from right inside the cover.</p><p>\t\u201cNo way.\u201d She asked in disbelief, mouth dropping open, eyes going wide.</p><p>\t\u201cYes way.\u201d He said smiling, relishing in her reaction, he wanted to kiss her all over again. \u201cI had to go through about six of my journals to find it.\u201d He said as he handed the page to her and she took it gently, her eyes going soft as she looked over his handwriting.\t</p><p>\t\u201cBut why? This is so special, Harry. You didn\u2019t have to.\u201d She nearly whispered, looking up into his eyes and he shrugged, a smile making its way onto his face.</p><p>\t\u201cBecause you loved the song and I knew that when I got to see you after the break I would be just as happy as I was when I wrote this song. Well actually, I think I\u2019m happier now that I\u2019m here with you.\u201d He said and her heart just about melted as she looked down at the page again. There were scribbles in the margins about instrumentation and little doodles of butterflies and flowers\u2026it was so perfectly <i>him.</i></p><p>\t\u201cThat\u2019s another thing I love about you\u2026 your art.\u201d She said glancing back up into his eyes, \u201cIt\u2019s probably my favorite thing about you.\u201d She confessed and he felt his heart racing as fast as the speed of light. He was melted butter with her words, he felt loved and important, and cherished. He held her face in his hands as he pressed his lips to hers once more. This time it wasn\u2019t as rushed, it was meaningful and emotional. \u201cWait, wait, wait, wait.\u201d She mumbled against his lips.</p><p>\t\u201cHmmm?\u201d He asked, pulling back.\t</p><p>\t\u201cNeed t\u2019put this somewhere safe!\u201d She said of the little page in her hands and he smiled. She hurried to her luggage and pulled out her lap top; he watched as she pulled it out of the case and set it on the bed, popping off the bottom cover and neatly laying the page there before settling the laptop back into the cover and then putting it away again. She walked back over to him and just hugged him to her, his head resting on her chest and she pulled back. \u201cThank you. S\u2019the best gift I\u2019ve ever received.\u201d She said and he smiled nuzzling back into her. \u201cAre you ready for bed?\u201d She asked and he shook his head. \u201cDo that, yeah? Then we can snuggle. I have thee funniest story to tell you\u2026 I almost called you over the break just to tell you.\u201d She said and he grinned.</p><p>\t\u201cCan\u2019t wait.\u201d</p></p>",

Harry was having the time of his life; Australia had been super fun and things between Lucy and him were just getting better. As Mitch had suggested, he had started asking more questions and getting to know things about her that not very many people knew. Things like her love for Wolfie, the dog her dad adopted for her when she started home-schooling; she considered him her best friend. He was actually named Wolfgang after none other than music prodigy, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, her favorite composer. That was another thing he had learned about her -and he himself was getting into- classical music. He also learned that she compiled playlists for people she knew, songs that reminded her of them for when she\u2019d miss them, he often wondered if she had one about him. These little things that he found so interesting and that made her unique in his eye were the ones swimming about in his everyday thoughts.</p><p>\tThey were on their way from Osaka to Chiba, it was a long drive and he was sitting in this little nook by a window on the bus, drawing. He was studying Lucy\u2019s face as she chatted and giggled with Clare, he smiled as he glanced down at his journal, squinting because he was trying to get the shape of her eyes just right. When he glanced up again she was looking at him, a smile on her face as she listened to what Clare was telling her about and he quickly glanced back down to his journal; he was listening to music, Mozart actually, and so he was just caught in a moment when his phone buzzed and he glanced down at it, unlocking it to see what she had said.</p><p>\tLucy:</p><p>\t\tStop staring at me, creep:)</p><p>\tHarry:</p><p>\t\tWho says I\u2019m even looking at you?</p><p>\tLucy: </p><p>\t\tYour eyes\u2026 and the direction they\u2019re looking\u2026?</p><p>\t\tI mean, I know I\u2019m cute, but geez no need to make it obvious</p><p>\tHarry chuckled as he read her response, face scrunching up all cute, that was her strategy, to look while she knew he wasn\u2019t. Lucy eagerly waited for his response.</p><p>\tHarry:\t</p><p>\t\tYeah, you are pretty cute:)</p><p>\tLucy:</p><p>\t\tI reckon you\u2019re pretty cute yourself. Anyway, I\u2019m being incredibly rude. Byeee!</p><p>\tHarry smiled down at his phone once more before getting back to his drawing. Some times glancing at her, not so obvious this time, but it seemed that she knew when he was about to look, because her eyes would flutter up and meet his every now and then, which made her blush more than him and he was the one who should be all blushy - being caught stealing glances and what not. Suddenly his moment was disturbed when Jeff sat down across from him. Harry quickly shut his journal and pushed his headphones to fall around his neck.</p><p>\t\u201cYou two are absolutely disgusting.\u201d He said through a smile and Harry chuckled.</p><p>\t\u201cThere\u2019s nothing going on.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cYet!\u201d Jeff cut in and Harry shook his head.</p><p>\t\u201cI think you should dedicate <i>Stockholm Syndrome </i>to her\u2026you always seem to be holed up in each other\u2019s rooms. Very appropriate song choice.\u201d He said and Harry giggled.</p><p>\t\u201cYou\u2019re dumb\u2026 please.\u201d He said and Jeff chuckled.</p><p>\t\u201cCan I let you in on a secret?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cShe likes you, her dad told me.\u201d Jeff said, grinning and Harry\u2019s eyes lit up, fighting hard not to glance at her. </p><p>\t\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cYeah, man. I swear! Maybe you should\u2026 make a move soon?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cMaybe\u2026 Oh, I was meaning to ask her, but it might be a sensitive topic. Where\u2019s her mum? She always talks about her dad.\u201d He said and Jeff nodded.</p><p>\t\u201cShe left them when Lucy was little. Ric doesn\u2019t talk about it much, but my mom told me that one day he got a call from the school telling him that no one came by to pick Lucy up. He was still in the UK at that point, so her aunt went to get her and she tried calling her mom but she didn\u2019t answer. When they got to their house all her things were gone and they just never heard from her again.\u201d He said quietly and Harry frowned, glancing at Lucy quickly.</p><p>\t\u201cOh wow\u2026 I can\u2019t even imagine how shitty that is.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cYeah, that\u2019s why she\u2019s so close to my mom. Her aunt, housekeeper, and my mom were pretty much the ones who helped raise her during those tough years. Her dad visited often, came back for every important thing, but when things started getting bad at her school he pulled her out and decided to move back.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cGod, it\u2019s always the best people that get fucked over.\u201d He mumbled and Jeff nodded.</p><p>\t\u201cYeah, but look at her now. It\u2019s as if nothing had ever happened.\u201d He said and Harry sighed. He glanced over to her when he saw her standing and he checked the time, it was 2 o\u2019clock; she was probably calling her dad. </p><p>\tLucy stepped into the back compartment of the bus and shut the door, dropping down onto the bed where her and Harry would lay and sighed as she dialed her dad. They talked for nearly twenty minutes without interruption, which did seem odd to her, even her dad pointed it out. They were saying their goodbyes when the door creaked open and Harry stepped in, a smile came over her face as she placed the phone down beside her and he let himself down, laying beside her.</p><p>\t\u201cMy dad was like \u201cwhere\u2019s Harry? I\u2019m so used to him interrupting?\u201d. He was very concerned.\u201d She said smiling and he smiled at her too.</p><p>\t\u201cLucy.\u201d He said and she rolled onto her side, facing him.</p><p>\t\u201cHmmm?\u201d She asked, letting her hand push back a few strands of hair that had fallen out of place.</p><p>\t\u201cI just need you to know how much you mean to me. Well, to all of us. You\u2019re one of the most talented and pretty persons I\u2019ve ever met and you\u2019re just a real gem. I\u2019m so glad you\u2019re here.\u201d He said and she smiled, a bit sadly though, her hand leaving his head and sliding under her head, giving her head some support.</p><p>\t\u201cJeff told you\u2026 about my mom?\u201d She whispered. \u201cYour whole mood changed\u2026 you guys were being very secretive, could feel you glancing towards me.\u201d She said knowingly.</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t mean to pry. I just wasn\u2019t sure how to bring it up to you.\u201d He said softly, his eyes pleading with hers for forgiveness.</p><p>\t\u201cIt\u2019s okay, m\u2019not upset. It was a long time ago; my dad and I talked about it and I get why she did it. She wasn\u2019t well\u2026 and she wasn\u2019t happy with us, so she decided to go.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d He said, his hand settled on her jaw, thumb caressing her cheek as she often did to him.</p><p>\t\u201cIt\u2019s fine, really. I forgave her a long time ago.\u201d She explained and he bit his lip. Who was this girl\u2026 she was everything he ever wanted. So pure and understanding, caring, loving\u2026. She was perfection incarnate.</p><p>\t\u201cThat\u2019s one of the things I love about you.\u201d He said and her eyes crinkled a bit when she smiled. \u201cYou\u2019re just so\u2026 I don\u2019t even know how to say it\u2026 you\u2019re just <i>you</i>. I love that.\u201d He said again, his eyes not daring to leave hers.</p><p>\t\u201cHey, new record!\u201d She said grinning and his brows furrowed in confusion.</p><p>\t\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019ve kept eye contact, this whole time.\u201d She said excitedly, her lovely smile making his heart race million miles a minute and he just surged forward and guided her face the rest of the way as he pressed his lips to hers.</p><p>\tHer eyes grew wide for a second, but soon fluttered shut at the feeling of his lips slotting against hers. The kiss made her heart burst with joy; her tummy was tingling as she attempted to pull him closer. They shuffled around until he was hovering over her, resting his weight on his forearms as he kissed on her with all the feeling he could muster up. Maybe he was reaching a bit, but it was worth the risk, he thought, as he let his tongue run against the top of her bottom lip. He smiled for a second as her arms wrapped around his neck, pulling him closer to her, it was an accident when his hips dragged against hers as he tried to decrease the distance between them, but the action made her mouth part in a little gasp and he took advantage, letting his tongue slip in and run over hers. This awakened something primal in her. Her hands ran down from around his neck and down his back, when they reached his lower back she pressed him down, causing more friction between them, Harry groaned into her mouth as he felt the bulge in his jeans growing against her. He kissed her feverishly, heart pounding in his chest because of the way her soft warm tongue felt against his. It took every ounce of self-control in him to pull back for just a second.</p><p>\t\u201cLucy, slow down.\u201d He panted and she seemed to realize what she had just done. Her eyes shot open and she bit her lip when she felt him pressed up against her thigh.</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Harry. I-if you want I can sort you out, s\u2019my fault.\u201d She said quickly and he shook his head.</p><p>\t\u201cNo, no, I\u2019ll be alright. Just figured I should stop you before you did something you weren\u2019t ready for or that you\u2019d regret later.\u201d He said pushing himself up to sit, ignoring the discomfort he felt because of the pulsating in his lower region as he helped her sit up as well.</p><p>\t\u201cThanks\u2026 again, sorry.\u201d She said, looking into his eyes and he just leaned forward, kissing her lips gently, just a quick, tiny one.</p><p>\t\u201cS\u2019alright. Quite like kissing you, love. Y\u2019taste so sweet.\u201d He said and her blood bubbled with a little bit of lust at his words. She wanted to lunge at him and also lick into his mouth and let him get away with whatever he wanted to. She would do just about anything for him. Her eyes fluttered shut at the mental images she was conjuring up.</p><p>\t\u201cPlease don\u2019t say that.\u201d She whined, her hands going to cover her face, she could feel her skin beginning to prick with the familiar tingles of arousal. Her lip was being gnawed on by her teeth, suppressing the feeling of lustful flames licking consistently at the deepest part of her core; a gentle and steady pulsing letting her know that she was turned on. She hadn\u2019t felt this type of thirst for anyone in a while.</p><p>\t\u201cM\u2019sorry.\u201d He said softly, trying to hold back a whine, because he felt it too. He knew she was fighting that animalistic need to just take whatever he was willing to give right then. His mouth actually watered as he watched her, squeezing her thighs together to relieve some of the pressure she felt. He was a grown ass man, he could control himself. His eyes clenched shut as he tried to think of the most innocent things. He wasn\u2019t going to do anything to Lucy on a fucking bus, she deserved more than that. The more he thought of it the more it helped calm him\u2026 how did he even consider that in the first place. When he peaked his eyes open she was just moving her hands away from her face, taking a deep breath and letting herself fall back onto the bed.</p><p>\t\u201cKissing you is dangerous.\u201d She said softly and he chuckled.</p><p>\t\u201cCould say the same about you.\u201d He mumbled and she shook her head in disbelief. </p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019m really sorry\u2026 I mean you know it\u2019s\u2026 been a while.\u201d She said and he nodded. She had her reasons and he respected that. \u201cJust got a bit carried away.\u201d She said, finally looking at him and he just smiled reassuringly at her.</p><p>\t\u201cS\u2019okay. We stopped in time, nothing happened. Just a pair of friends who kissed, thas\u2019all. Besides, m\u2019the one who started it. Maybe it was your fault though, you\u2019re pretty fucking tempting.\u201d He said and she chuckled.</p><p>\t\u201cLet\u2019s just drop it.\u201d She said, her eyes fluttering shut once more.</p><p>\t\u201cSorry.\u201d He said softly and she nodded. \u201cSo\u2026 what\u2019re you gonna do on your week off?\u201d He inquired, changing the subject.</p><p>\t\u201cAlready?\u201d She asked and he nodded. \u201cI hadn\u2019t even bought my ticket\u2026\u201d she mumbled. \u201cWell I suppose I\u2019ll be going home.\u201d She said quietly, \u201cI do miss my dad and Wolfie.\u201d She said of her dog and he smiled.</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019m sure they miss you like crazy, too.\u201d</p><p>-</p><p>-</p><p>-</p><p>\tThat night as she lay in her hotel bed with all the guilt and anxiety in her heart being pushed away, she got herself off. Moaning and whimpering about Harry and the things she thought about him doing to her. She was panting, suddenly feeling hot and barely alleviated from this feeling. It had even been a while since she got herself off\u2026 how would she ever even look in his eyes again after this? She had to take another shower because she was still feeling the warmth of lust tickling at her. She also managed to buy a flight, which was a great distraction, although it would be leaving half way through the show. </p><p>\tThe next morning she made sure to tell Jeff and her crew mates, who all assured her it would be fine. As they accustomed now, she saw Harry\u2019s outfit and assured him he\u2019d be amazing and had to go and pack shortly after. Right around the time the show was starting she was on her way to the airport, regretting that she didn\u2019t actually say goodbye. But she figured this distance would be good; the things she was feeling for Harry were driving her insane and she really could use a break from him.</p><p>\tWhen she landed in LAX she turned her airplane mode off and bit her lip as a text from Harry popped up on the screen and she opened it, waiting for them to allow them to disembark.</p><p>\tHarry:</p><p>\t\tYou left without saying goodbye?!?!</p><p>\t\tDespicable!</p><p>\t\tJust kidding. I hope you have a lovely time at home. Tell your dad hi for me and Wolfie, too. - H xx.</p><p>\tLucy locked her phone as she let out a sigh. She would text back, eventually\u2026 she had to think of something to say that wasn\u2019t just \u2018sorry\u2019. She snapped out of her thoughts when the person standing behind her tapped her to keep moving and with a quick muttered apology she hurried down the narrow aisle, off the plane, and into the cold airport. Naturally, her bags were some of the last to come out onto the claims carousel, so she took the time to order an Uber, and was hurrying off to the pick-up when the woman texted her that she had arrived. Then from there it was another half hour before she was being dropped off at home, the large wooden gate blocking the view of their home from the outside world and she called from the intercom.</p><p>\t\u201cYes?\u201d Her dad said and she smiled.</p><p>\t\u201cI have a delivery for Mr. Y/L/N! All the way from Japan!\u201d this is how he\u2019d announce his return home to her when she was a child.</p><p>\t\u201cSweetheart! What a surprise! Come on in!\u201d He cheered joyfully as a buzz sounded and the wood doors slowly parted. She was walking up the long drive way when her dad and Wolfie quickly came down. They were equally excited to see her.</p><p>-</p><p>-</p><p>-</p><p>\tHarry\u2019s flight was just landing in Heathrow, he checked his phone right away, he wasn\u2019t one to fret over that, but he just wanted to see if Lucy had texted him back, but she hadn\u2019t. Maybe he had done something? He worried his bottom lip between his teeth as he was let off the plane and until he got home, where his mum was waiting for him. They had a cup of tea and then she went out to breakfast with Gemma and he opted to stay in to sleep and lie around, turning on the telly to see if anything good was on. Suddenly his phone was ringing and Lucy\u2019s name was on the screen, he didn\u2019t even wait a second to pick up.</p><p>\t\u201c\u2018Lo?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cHi, sorry were you sleeping?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cNo, don\u2019t worry.\u201d He assured her.</p><p>\t\u201cSure? I asked Jeff and he told me your flight would get in in the around 8am, so I waited a bit in case you were sleeping.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cYeah, m\u2019sure. I got in like an hour ago. What are you doing up?\u201d He asked, \u201cS\u2019like past midnight for you.\u201d He said squinting at the clock on the wall.</p><p>\t\u201cI just got in bed. I forgot to text you back, got so carried away being back and everything- hold on.\u201d She said and he heard some shuffling and in a few moments she was back. \u201cSorry, Wolfie was scratching at the door, wanted to come snuggle.\u201d She whispered and he smiled.</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019d love to see him, send me a picture later, alright?\u201d He asked.</p><p>\t\u201cYeah, alright. How was the flight?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cGood, I slept most of the way through, so m\u2019not too tired, just a bit jet lagged.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cOh, I know\u2026 I\u2019m hungry for dinner and it\u2019s not even near breakfast time,\u201d she said and he chuckled. Should he say that he misses her? Because he does, a lot. \u201cI just wanted to call to say sorry for leaving abruptly, this was the only flight I could find that didn\u2019t have transfer or layover, so I took it.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cS\u2019alright. Was just a little shocked when I couldn\u2019t find you afterwards.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cBeing evasive is part of my mysteriousness as a woman, sorry.\u201d She said giggling and he followed suit, rolling his eyes a bit and turning to his side and frowning a bit when he recalled that she wasn\u2019t actually there. She wasn\u2019t even a little near; there was an entire ocean and a continent between them at the moment and he could feel it. \u201cYou know, earlier this evening as I was washing clothes I decided to listen to your last album as One Direction and I must say <i>Olivia </i>is one of the greatest pieces of music I\u2019ve heard in a long time. Everything about it screams light and joy and excitement! God, I listened to it about ten times\u2026 well done. The lyrics are beautiful, they gave me butterflies in my tummy picturing how happy you must\u2019ve been when you were inspired to write it and I just couldn\u2019t stop smiling after that.\u201d She confessed and he smiled.</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019d kill to see you smile right now.\u201d He said softly and she felt her heart flutter in her chest, his eyes grew wide at the realization of what he\u2019d actually just said and waited anxiously for a response.</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019ll make sure I\u2019m in the picture with Wolfie then.\u201d She said and he chuckled.</p><p>\t\u201cOkay, you already said it.\u201d </p><p>\t\u201cIt\u2019s gonna be a long week.\u201d She said quietly and he hummed, letting his eyes close for a moment.</p><p>\t\u201cYeah\u2026 but enjoy this time with your dad, yeah? He must be thrilled to have you home.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cHe is, he cried when he saw me. I cried a little too, I missed him a lot.\u201d She yawned and he frowned, she was tired, and as much as he wanted to keep talking to her, he should let her go.</p><p>\t\u201cHey, get some sleep fo\u2019 me, love. We\u2019ll see each other real soon alright?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cYeah.\u201d She said quietly.</p><p>\t\u201cAnd if you really, really miss me you can always call. But I\u2019d prefer you didn\u2019t.\u201d He said smiling.</p><p>\t\u201cWhy not?\u201d She frowned, scratching between Wolfie\u2019s ears when he laid his head on her tummy.</p><p>\t\u201cBecause if you don\u2019t it\u2019ll be even more exciting when we see each other again. Absence makes the heart grow fonder\u2026 or at least that\u2019s what they say.\u201d He said.</p><p>\t\u201cDon\u2019t see how I could be any more fond than I am now.\u201d She said softly before yawning once more and literally his heart skipped a beat at her sleepy confession. \u201cGood night, H.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cG\u2019night, Lucy.\u201d He smiled.</p><p>\t\u201cOh almost forgot!\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cMwah!\u201d She made a little kissy noise and he blushed, face beet red, \u201cShould last you the week.\u201d She giggled and before he could say anything the line went dead. He couldn\u2019t wait for the week to be over.</p><p>-</p><p>-</p><p>-</p><p>\tLucy woke up to Wolfie barking angrily out the window, she groaned as she turned over, burying her head in the pillow. She had only been home three days and already there was commotion.</p><p>\t\u201cWolfie, please\u2026 Shhhh!\u201d She shushed and the dog whined before jumping onto the bed. She could faintly hear shouting. She sat up, perking her ears up and eyes growing wide at the familiar voice growing closer and closer. She rushed out of bed and Wolfie shot after her like a bullet and she hurried out to the entrance, squinting and seeing none other than Ezra, storming up the drive way with her dad hot on his trail, demanding that he get off his property.</p><p>\t\u201cLucy!\u201d He said when he saw her, running up to where she was standing, her eyes welled up at the image of him. God, he was beautiful, but he had hurt her so much. Wolfie was barking and her dad was shouting at him to stay back, and Ezra was pleading with her, it was a fucking mess.</p><p>\t\u201cDon\u2019t you dare touch my daughter!\u201d Her dad shouted, standing between them, pushing him back as Ezra reached out to her.</p><p>\t\u201cDad, s\u2019alright. I think we need to have a talk.\u201d She said softly and he looked back at her with wild eyes. Wolfie took a sniff at him and calmed when he recognized the scent.</p><p>\t\u201cI told you!\u201d Ezra said, standing with more confidence.</p><p>\t\u201cCall for me if you need me, I\u2019ll be right inside.\u201d Her dad said before he called Wolfie back inside and she sat on the steps to that led to the porch, sighing and he followed suit.</p><p>\t\u201cHow\u2019d you get in?\u201d She asked.</p><p>\t\u201cSaid it was a package for you\u2026\u201d he said before chuckling and Lucy managed a giggle despite the ache in her chest. She was feeling it more now that Harry wasn\u2019t nearby and that the one who caused her all the pain was right beside her, she could feel the warmth of his skin radiating onto her bare arms.</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019ve told him he should get a camera\u2026 he\u2019s a gullible guy.\u201d She said and he chuckled. Her breath hitched in her throat when his hand landed on hers and squeezed over it.</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019m sorry for everything I said before. I love you.\u201d He said, searching in her eyes for a response, but she just pulled her hand away, it didn\u2019t feel like Harry\u2019s. \u201cI know I fucked up, but I need you. I really do love you and I\u2019ve been going insane without you.\u201d He said and she sighed.</p><p>\t\u201cWe don\u2019t work, Ezra. It may have been a while back, but the things you did\u2026 I can\u2019t trust you and you never did a good job of earning it back. Besides, I\u2019m so much busier now and have a million things to do when this tour ends, it\u2019s impossible.\u201d She said and he shook his head as she stood, ready to end the conversation, he did the same.</p><p>\t\u201cBabe, come on.\u201d He pleaded.</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019m not your babe or anything anymore. Thanks for coming and saying sorry, but I don\u2019t\u2026 love you anymore.\u201d She said softly and his eyes narrowed.</p><p>\t\u201cAre you with someone else?\u201d He bellowed.</p><p>\t\u201cNo! I\u2019m just over this!\u201d She signaled between them. \u201cI\u2019m not the fucking cheater here!\u201d She argued back, not afraid to stand up for herself anymore, she didn\u2019t need this. She didn\u2019t deserve <i>this</i>. </p><p>\t\u201cTell me you don\u2019t miss this.\u201d He said taking her hands, gripping them tight, she couldn\u2019t pull back. \u201cOr this\u2026\u201d he said wrapping his arms around her and pulling her in, pressing his lips to hers, she thrashed her head around, hating the feeling of his lips on hers, tears ran down her face as she tried to pull back because it wasn\u2019t Harry.</p><p>\t\u201cGet the fuck away from my daughter, you son of a bitch!\u201d Her dad burst through the door with a broom, he was caught off guard for a moment and she shoved him away, wiping her mouth on the back of her hand. </p><p>\t\u201cPlease, just go and don\u2019t contact me again. We\u2019re done, Ezra.\u201d She stated flatly and he shook his head before flipping them off.</p><p>\t\u201cGet him out!\u201d Her dad shouted to Wolfie and Wolfie chased him down the long drive way until he was out the gate. Lucy\u2019s dad jumped, startled as she burst into laughter through her tears, trying to catch her breath, wheezing and he started laughing, too.</p><p>\t\u201cWhat is it?\u201d He asked between fits and she shook her head, wiping a tear from her eye as she caught her breath.</p><p>\t\u201cYou came out with a freaking broom!\u201d She said hugging him tight as they laughed again.</p><p>\t\u201cI don\u2019t have a gun!\u201d He said laughing and she shook her head. \u201cGet inside, I was in the middle of making pancakes when this asshole showed up, probably all cold by now.\u201d He complained.</p><p>\tThat was the highlight of her week and it was killing her not to call Harry and tell him the story, but she was trying her best to wait. The week was almost over, and although she was sad to be leaving her dad again, she would be seeing Harry soon.</p><p>-</p><p>-</p><p>-</p><p>\tTo say that the rest of the week flew by was an understatement; Lucy was anxious to see Harry. As he had suggested, they didn\u2019t talk all week except for the picture she promised him of herself with Wolfie, her lovable doberman. Her flight would be landing earlier than the bands because as part of the roadie crew, she had to go and set up the arena. She had arrived two days before the show, they spent part of that afternoon and a large part of the next day setting up in the arena. Lucy spent the evening before the show in her hotel room reading. She knew they\u2019d be arriving tonight, she wasn\u2019t exactly sure at what time, but when it hit 9pm she got ready for bed and dimmed the lights, just a bit disappointed they hadn\u2019t arrived yet. She continued reading until the words started blurring together and the lines started shifting on the page and finally until she just couldn\u2019t keep her eyes open anymore.</p><p>\tLucy groaned at the familiar sound of her phone ringing, she reached for it on the night stand, answering quickly.</p><p>\t\u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019ve got a surprise for you.\u201d The familiar voice said and she shot up, her heart hammering in her chest at Harry\u2019s voice. </p><p>\t\u201cHarry?\u201d She asked into a yawn and he chuckled.</p><p>\t\u201cYeah, s\u2019me! Come to your door!\u201d He urged.</p><p>\t\u201cOkay, m\u2019coming!\u201d She chirped excitedly.</p><p>\tShe hurried to the bathroom and gargled some mouth wash as fast as she could, which woke her up enough and bolted for the door. When she turned it open and saw him standing there it felt like her heart was going to beat out of her chest as they beamed at each other. Her skin was buzzing, itching to touch his skin. He practically charged her, hugging around her waist and picking her up, stepping past the door and kicking it closed as his lips found hers easily, despite the dark. He was overwhelmed with joy and warmth at the feeling of her in his arms. Her lips were nice and soft for him, eagerly opening up as he dipped his tongue into her mouth and tasted her after what had seemed like ages. He groaned at the way she was sweet on his tongue and how her hands wove into the hair at the back of his head, carding through it gently. She pulled back to take a breath and pressed a quick kiss at the corner of his mouth, panting as she burrowed herself in his neck, loving his familiar scent.</p><p>\t\u201cI missed you so much.\u201d She mumbled into his throat, his heart pumping faster when she kissed him right under his jaw, just one little kiss, but it did things to him.</p><p>\t\u201cMe too, love. Now, let me show you your surprise.\u201d He said letting her down and she grinned up at him, taking his hand and pulling him to the bed, the dim lamp still giving the room a nice glow. She took a seat on the bed as he pulled his journal out from his bag before setting it down. He couldn\u2019t stop smiling and neither could she, she was buzzing with excitement.</p><p>\t\u201cWhat is it?\u201d She asked impatiently and he chuckled, opening the cover.</p><p>\t\u201cIn my hands, I have for you the original journal entry of the lyrics for <i>Olivia.</i>\u201d Her eyes grew wide as he pulled out a loose page from right inside the cover.</p><p>\t\u201cNo way.\u201d She asked in disbelief, mouth dropping open, eyes going wide.</p><p>\t\u201cYes way.\u201d He said smiling, relishing in her reaction, he wanted to kiss her all over again. \u201cI had to go through about six of my journals to find it.\u201d He said as he handed the page to her and she took it gently, her eyes going soft as she looked over his handwriting.\t</p><p>\t\u201cBut why? This is so special, Harry. You didn\u2019t have to.\u201d She nearly whispered, looking up into his eyes and he shrugged, a smile making its way onto his face.</p><p>\t\u201cBecause you loved the song and I knew that when I got to see you after the break I would be just as happy as I was when I wrote this song. Well actually, I think I\u2019m happier now that I\u2019m here with you.\u201d He said and her heart just about melted as she looked down at the page again. There were scribbles in the margins about instrumentation and little doodles of butterflies and flowers\u2026it was so perfectly <i>him.</i></p><p>\t\u201cThat\u2019s another thing I love about you\u2026 your art.\u201d She said glancing back up into his eyes, \u201cIt\u2019s probably my favorite thing about you.\u201d She confessed and he felt his heart racing as fast as the speed of light. He was melted butter with her words, he felt loved and important, and cherished. He held her face in his hands as he pressed his lips to hers once more. This time it wasn\u2019t as rushed, it was meaningful and emotional. \u201cWait, wait, wait, wait.\u201d She mumbled against his lips.</p><p>\t\u201cHmmm?\u201d He asked, pulling back.\t</p><p>\t\u201cNeed t\u2019put this somewhere safe!\u201d She said of the little page in her hands and he smiled. She hurried to her luggage and pulled out her lap top; he watched as she pulled it out of the case and set it on the bed, popping off the bottom cover and neatly laying the page there before settling the laptop back into the cover and then putting it away again. She walked back over to him and just hugged him to her, his head resting on her chest and she pulled back. \u201cThank you. S\u2019the best gift I\u2019ve ever received.\u201d She said and he smiled nuzzling back into her. \u201cAre you ready for bed?\u201d She asked and he shook his head. \u201cDo that, yeah? Then we can snuggle. I have thee funniest story to tell you\u2026 I almost called you over the break just to tell you.\u201d She said and he grinned.</p><p>\t\u201cCan\u2019t wait.\u201d</p></p>",

Harry was having the time of his life; Australia had been super fun and things between Lucy and him were just getting better. As Mitch had suggested, he had started asking more questions and getting to know things about her that not very many people knew. Things like her love for Wolfie, the dog her dad adopted for her when she started home-schooling; she considered him her best friend. He was actually named Wolfgang after none other than music prodigy, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, her favorite composer. That was another thing he had learned about her -and he himself was getting into- classical music. He also learned that she compiled playlists for people she knew, songs that reminded her of them for when she&rsquo;d miss them, he often wondered if she had one about him. These little things that he found so interesting and that made her unique in his eye were the ones swimming about in his everyday thoughts.</p><p>\tThey were on their way from Osaka to Chiba, it was a long drive and he was sitting in this little nook by a window on the bus, drawing. He was studying Lucy&rsquo;s face as she chatted and giggled with Clare, he smiled as he glanced down at his journal, squinting because he was trying to get the shape of her eyes just right. When he glanced up again she was looking at him, a smile on her face as she listened to what Clare was telling her about and he quickly glanced back down to his journal; he was listening to music, Mozart actually, and so he was just caught in a moment when his phone buzzed and he glanced down at it, unlocking it to see what she had said.</p><p>\tLucy:</p><p>\t\tStop staring at me, creep:)</p><p>\tHarry:</p><p>\t\tWho says I&rsquo;m even looking at you?</p><p>\tLucy: </p><p>\t\tYour eyes&hellip; and the direction they&rsquo;re looking&hellip;?</p><p>\t\tI mean, I know I&rsquo;m cute, but geez no need to make it obvious</p><p>\tHarry chuckled as he read her response, face scrunching up all cute, that was her strategy, to look while she knew he wasn&rsquo;t. Lucy eagerly waited for his response.</p><p>\tHarry:\t</p><p>\t\tYeah, you are pretty cute:)</p><p>\tLucy:</p><p>\t\tI reckon you&rsquo;re pretty cute yourself. Anyway, I&rsquo;m being incredibly rude. Byeee!</p><p>\tHarry smiled down at his phone once more before getting back to his drawing. Some times glancing at her, not so obvious this time, but it seemed that she knew when he was about to look, because her eyes would flutter up and meet his every now and then, which made her blush more than him and he was the one who should be all blushy - being caught stealing glances and what not. Suddenly his moment was disturbed when Jeff sat down across from him. Harry quickly shut his journal and pushed his headphones to fall around his neck.</p><p>\t&ldquo;You two are absolutely disgusting.&rdquo; He said through a smile and Harry chuckled.</p><p>\t&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing going on.&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Yet!&rdquo; Jeff cut in and Harry shook his head.</p><p>\t&ldquo;I think you should dedicate <i>Stockholm Syndrome </i>to her&hellip;you always seem to be holed up in each other&rsquo;s rooms. Very appropriate song choice.&rdquo; He said and Harry giggled.</p><p>\t&ldquo;You&rsquo;re dumb&hellip; please.&rdquo; He said and Jeff chuckled.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Can I let you in on a secret?&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;She likes you, her dad told me.&rdquo; Jeff said, grinning and Harry&rsquo;s eyes lit up, fighting hard not to glance at her. </p><p>\t&ldquo;Really?&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Yeah, man. I swear! Maybe you should&hellip; make a move soon?&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Maybe&hellip; Oh, I was meaning to ask her, but it might be a sensitive topic. Where&rsquo;s her mum? She always talks about her dad.&rdquo; He said and Jeff nodded.</p><p>\t&ldquo;She left them when Lucy was little. Ric doesn&rsquo;t talk about it much, but my mom told me that one day he got a call from the school telling him that no one came by to pick Lucy up. He was still in the UK at that point, so her aunt went to get her and she tried calling her mom but she didn&rsquo;t answer. When they got to their house all her things were gone and they just never heard from her again.&rdquo; He said quietly and Harry frowned, glancing at Lucy quickly.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Oh wow&hellip; I can&rsquo;t even imagine how shitty that is.&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Yeah, that&rsquo;s why she&rsquo;s so close to my mom. Her aunt, housekeeper, and my mom were pretty much the ones who helped raise her during those tough years. Her dad visited often, came back for every important thing, but when things started getting bad at her school he pulled her out and decided to move back.&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;God, it&rsquo;s always the best people that get fucked over.&rdquo; He mumbled and Jeff nodded.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Yeah, but look at her now. It&rsquo;s as if nothing had ever happened.&rdquo; He said and Harry sighed. He glanced over to her when he saw her standing and he checked the time, it was 2 o&rsquo;clock; she was probably calling her dad. </p><p>\tLucy stepped into the back compartment of the bus and shut the door, dropping down onto the bed where her and Harry would lay and sighed as she dialed her dad. They talked for nearly twenty minutes without interruption, which did seem odd to her, even her dad pointed it out. They were saying their goodbyes when the door creaked open and Harry stepped in, a smile came over her face as she placed the phone down beside her and he let himself down, laying beside her.</p><p>\t&ldquo;My dad was like &ldquo;where&rsquo;s Harry? I&rsquo;m so used to him interrupting?&rdquo;. He was very concerned.&rdquo; She said smiling and he smiled at her too.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Lucy.&rdquo; He said and she rolled onto her side, facing him.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Hmmm?&rdquo; She asked, letting her hand push back a few strands of hair that had fallen out of place.</p><p>\t&ldquo;I just need you to know how much you mean to me. Well, to all of us. You&rsquo;re one of the most talented and pretty persons I&rsquo;ve ever met and you&rsquo;re just a real gem. I&rsquo;m so glad you&rsquo;re here.&rdquo; He said and she smiled, a bit sadly though, her hand leaving his head and sliding under her head, giving her head some support.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Jeff told you&hellip; about my mom?&rdquo; She whispered. &ldquo;Your whole mood changed&hellip; you guys were being very secretive, could feel you glancing towards me.&rdquo; She said knowingly.</p><p>\t&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, I didn&rsquo;t mean to pry. I just wasn&rsquo;t sure how to bring it up to you.&rdquo; He said softly, his eyes pleading with hers for forgiveness.</p><p>\t&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay, m&rsquo;not upset. It was a long time ago; my dad and I talked about it and I get why she did it. She wasn&rsquo;t well&hellip; and she wasn&rsquo;t happy with us, so she decided to go.&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo; He said, his hand settled on her jaw, thumb caressing her cheek as she often did to him.</p><p>\t&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine, really. I forgave her a long time ago.&rdquo; She explained and he bit his lip. Who was this girl&hellip; she was everything he ever wanted. So pure and understanding, caring, loving&hellip;. She was perfection incarnate.</p><p>\t&ldquo;That&rsquo;s one of the things I love about you.&rdquo; He said and her eyes crinkled a bit when she smiled. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re just so&hellip; I don&rsquo;t even know how to say it&hellip; you&rsquo;re just <i>you</i>. I love that.&rdquo; He said again, his eyes not daring to leave hers.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Hey, new record!&rdquo; She said grinning and his brows furrowed in confusion.</p><p>\t&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve kept eye contact, this whole time.&rdquo; She said excitedly, her lovely smile making his heart race million miles a minute and he just surged forward and guided her face the rest of the way as he pressed his lips to hers.</p><p>\tHer eyes grew wide for a second, but soon fluttered shut at the feeling of his lips slotting against hers. The kiss made her heart burst with joy; her tummy was tingling as she attempted to pull him closer. They shuffled around until he was hovering over her, resting his weight on his forearms as he kissed on her with all the feeling he could muster up. Maybe he was reaching a bit, but it was worth the risk, he thought, as he let his tongue run against the top of her bottom lip. He smiled for a second as her arms wrapped around his neck, pulling him closer to her, it was an accident when his hips dragged against hers as he tried to decrease the distance between them, but the action made her mouth part in a little gasp and he took advantage, letting his tongue slip in and run over hers. This awakened something primal in her. Her hands ran down from around his neck and down his back, when they reached his lower back she pressed him down, causing more friction between them, Harry groaned into her mouth as he felt the bulge in his jeans growing against her. He kissed her feverishly, heart pounding in his chest because of the way her soft warm tongue felt against his. It took every ounce of self-control in him to pull back for just a second.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Lucy, slow down.&rdquo; He panted and she seemed to realize what she had just done. Her eyes shot open and she bit her lip when she felt him pressed up against her thigh.</p><p>\t&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Harry. I-if you want I can sort you out, s&rsquo;my fault.&rdquo; She said quickly and he shook his head.</p><p>\t&ldquo;No, no, I&rsquo;ll be alright. Just figured I should stop you before you did something you weren&rsquo;t ready for or that you&rsquo;d regret later.&rdquo; He said pushing himself up to sit, ignoring the discomfort he felt because of the pulsating in his lower region as he helped her sit up as well.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Thanks&hellip; again, sorry.&rdquo; She said, looking into his eyes and he just leaned forward, kissing her lips gently, just a quick, tiny one.</p><p>\t&ldquo;S&rsquo;alright. Quite like kissing you, love. Y&rsquo;taste so sweet.&rdquo; He said and her blood bubbled with a little bit of lust at his words. She wanted to lunge at him and also lick into his mouth and let him get away with whatever he wanted to. She would do just about anything for him. Her eyes fluttered shut at the mental images she was conjuring up.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t say that.&rdquo; She whined, her hands going to cover her face, she could feel her skin beginning to prick with the familiar tingles of arousal. Her lip was being gnawed on by her teeth, suppressing the feeling of lustful flames licking consistently at the deepest part of her core; a gentle and steady pulsing letting her know that she was turned on. She hadn&rsquo;t felt this type of thirst for anyone in a while.</p><p>\t&ldquo;M&rsquo;sorry.&rdquo; He said softly, trying to hold back a whine, because he felt it too. He knew she was fighting that animalistic need to just take whatever he was willing to give right then. His mouth actually watered as he watched her, squeezing her thighs together to relieve some of the pressure she felt. He was a grown ass man, he could control himself. His eyes clenched shut as he tried to think of the most innocent things. He wasn&rsquo;t going to do anything to Lucy on a fucking bus, she deserved more than that. The more he thought of it the more it helped calm him&hellip; how did he even consider that in the first place. When he peaked his eyes open she was just moving her hands away from her face, taking a deep breath and letting herself fall back onto the bed.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Kissing you is dangerous.&rdquo; She said softly and he chuckled.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Could say the same about you.&rdquo; He mumbled and she shook her head in disbelief. </p><p>\t&ldquo;I&rsquo;m really sorry&hellip; I mean you know it&rsquo;s&hellip; been a while.&rdquo; She said and he nodded. She had her reasons and he respected that. &ldquo;Just got a bit carried away.&rdquo; She said, finally looking at him and he just smiled reassuringly at her.</p><p>\t&ldquo;S&rsquo;okay. We stopped in time, nothing happened. Just a pair of friends who kissed, thas&rsquo;all. Besides, m&rsquo;the one who started it. Maybe it was your fault though, you&rsquo;re pretty fucking tempting.&rdquo; He said and she chuckled.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s just drop it.&rdquo; She said, her eyes fluttering shut once more.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Sorry.&rdquo; He said softly and she nodded. &ldquo;So&hellip; what&rsquo;re you gonna do on your week off?&rdquo; He inquired, changing the subject.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Already?&rdquo; She asked and he nodded. &ldquo;I hadn&rsquo;t even bought my ticket&hellip;&rdquo; she mumbled. &ldquo;Well I suppose I&rsquo;ll be going home.&rdquo; She said quietly, &ldquo;I do miss my dad and Wolfie.&rdquo; She said of her dog and he smiled.</p><p>\t&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure they miss you like crazy, too.&rdquo;</p><p>-</p><p>-</p><p>-</p><p>\tThat night as she lay in her hotel bed with all the guilt and anxiety in her heart being pushed away, she got herself off. Moaning and whimpering about Harry and the things she thought about him doing to her. She was panting, suddenly feeling hot and barely alleviated from this feeling. It had even been a while since she got herself off&hellip; how would she ever even look in his eyes again after this? She had to take another shower because she was still feeling the warmth of lust tickling at her. She also managed to buy a flight, which was a great distraction, although it would be leaving half way through the show. </p><p>\tThe next morning she made sure to tell Jeff and her crew mates, who all assured her it would be fine. As they accustomed now, she saw Harry&rsquo;s outfit and assured him he&rsquo;d be amazing and had to go and pack shortly after. Right around the time the show was starting she was on her way to the airport, regretting that she didn&rsquo;t actually say goodbye. But she figured this distance would be good; the things she was feeling for Harry were driving her insane and she really could use a break from him.</p><p>\tWhen she landed in LAX she turned her airplane mode off and bit her lip as a text from Harry popped up on the screen and she opened it, waiting for them to allow them to disembark.</p><p>\tHarry:</p><p>\t\tYou left without saying goodbye?!?!</p><p>\t\tDespicable!</p><p>\t\tJust kidding. I hope you have a lovely time at home. Tell your dad hi for me and Wolfie, too. - H xx.</p><p>\tLucy locked her phone as she let out a sigh. She would text back, eventually&hellip; she had to think of something to say that wasn&rsquo;t just &lsquo;sorry&rsquo;. She snapped out of her thoughts when the person standing behind her tapped her to keep moving and with a quick muttered apology she hurried down the narrow aisle, off the plane, and into the cold airport. Naturally, her bags were some of the last to come out onto the claims carousel, so she took the time to order an Uber, and was hurrying off to the pick-up when the woman texted her that she had arrived. Then from there it was another half hour before she was being dropped off at home, the large wooden gate blocking the view of their home from the outside world and she called from the intercom.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; Her dad said and she smiled.</p><p>\t&ldquo;I have a delivery for Mr. Y/L/N! All the way from Japan!&rdquo; this is how he&rsquo;d announce his return home to her when she was a child.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Sweetheart! What a surprise! Come on in!&rdquo; He cheered joyfully as a buzz sounded and the wood doors slowly parted. She was walking up the long drive way when her dad and Wolfie quickly came down. They were equally excited to see her.</p><p>-</p><p>-</p><p>-</p><p>\tHarry&rsquo;s flight was just landing in Heathrow, he checked his phone right away, he wasn&rsquo;t one to fret over that, but he just wanted to see if Lucy had texted him back, but she hadn&rsquo;t. Maybe he had done something? He worried his bottom lip between his teeth as he was let off the plane and until he got home, where his mum was waiting for him. They had a cup of tea and then she went out to breakfast with Gemma and he opted to stay in to sleep and lie around, turning on the telly to see if anything good was on. Suddenly his phone was ringing and Lucy&rsquo;s name was on the screen, he didn&rsquo;t even wait a second to pick up.</p><p>\t&ldquo;&lsquo;Lo?&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Hi, sorry were you sleeping?&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;No, don&rsquo;t worry.&rdquo; He assured her.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Sure? I asked Jeff and he told me your flight would get in in the around 8am, so I waited a bit in case you were sleeping.&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Yeah, m&rsquo;sure. I got in like an hour ago. What are you doing up?&rdquo; He asked, &ldquo;S&rsquo;like past midnight for you.&rdquo; He said squinting at the clock on the wall.</p><p>\t&ldquo;I just got in bed. I forgot to text you back, got so carried away being back and everything- hold on.&rdquo; She said and he heard some shuffling and in a few moments she was back. &ldquo;Sorry, Wolfie was scratching at the door, wanted to come snuggle.&rdquo; She whispered and he smiled.</p><p>\t&ldquo;I&rsquo;d love to see him, send me a picture later, alright?&rdquo; He asked.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Yeah, alright. How was the flight?&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Good, I slept most of the way through, so m&rsquo;not too tired, just a bit jet lagged.&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Oh, I know&hellip; I&rsquo;m hungry for dinner and it&rsquo;s not even near breakfast time,&rdquo; she said and he chuckled. Should he say that he misses her? Because he does, a lot. &ldquo;I just wanted to call to say sorry for leaving abruptly, this was the only flight I could find that didn&rsquo;t have transfer or layover, so I took it.&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;S&rsquo;alright. Was just a little shocked when I couldn&rsquo;t find you afterwards.&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Being evasive is part of my mysteriousness as a woman, sorry.&rdquo; She said giggling and he followed suit, rolling his eyes a bit and turning to his side and frowning a bit when he recalled that she wasn&rsquo;t actually there. She wasn&rsquo;t even a little near; there was an entire ocean and a continent between them at the moment and he could feel it. &ldquo;You know, earlier this evening as I was washing clothes I decided to listen to your last album as One Direction and I must say <i>Olivia </i>is one of the greatest pieces of music I&rsquo;ve heard in a long time. Everything about it screams light and joy and excitement! God, I listened to it about ten times&hellip; well done. The lyrics are beautiful, they gave me butterflies in my tummy picturing how happy you must&rsquo;ve been when you were inspired to write it and I just couldn&rsquo;t stop smiling after that.&rdquo; She confessed and he smiled.</p><p>\t&ldquo;I&rsquo;d kill to see you smile right now.&rdquo; He said softly and she felt her heart flutter in her chest, his eyes grew wide at the realization of what he&rsquo;d actually just said and waited anxiously for a response.</p><p>\t&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make sure I&rsquo;m in the picture with Wolfie then.&rdquo; She said and he chuckled.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Okay, you already said it.&rdquo; </p><p>\t&ldquo;It&rsquo;s gonna be a long week.&rdquo; She said quietly and he hummed, letting his eyes close for a moment.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Yeah&hellip; but enjoy this time with your dad, yeah? He must be thrilled to have you home.&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;He is, he cried when he saw me. I cried a little too, I missed him a lot.&rdquo; She yawned and he frowned, she was tired, and as much as he wanted to keep talking to her, he should let her go.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Hey, get some sleep fo&rsquo; me, love. We&rsquo;ll see each other real soon alright?&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo; She said quietly.</p><p>\t&ldquo;And if you really, really miss me you can always call. But I&rsquo;d prefer you didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo; He said smiling.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; She frowned, scratching between Wolfie&rsquo;s ears when he laid his head on her tummy.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Because if you don&rsquo;t it&rsquo;ll be even more exciting when we see each other again. Absence makes the heart grow fonder&hellip; or at least that&rsquo;s what they say.&rdquo; He said.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t see how I could be any more fond than I am now.&rdquo; She said softly before yawning once more and literally his heart skipped a beat at her sleepy confession. &ldquo;Good night, H.&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;G&rsquo;night, Lucy.&rdquo; He smiled.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Oh almost forgot!&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Mwah!&rdquo; She made a little kissy noise and he blushed, face beet red, &ldquo;Should last you the week.&rdquo; She giggled and before he could say anything the line went dead. He couldn&rsquo;t wait for the week to be over.</p><p>-</p><p>-</p><p>-</p><p>\tLucy woke up to Wolfie barking angrily out the window, she groaned as she turned over, burying her head in the pillow. She had only been home three days and already there was commotion.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Wolfie, please&hellip; Shhhh!&rdquo; She shushed and the dog whined before jumping onto the bed. She could faintly hear shouting. She sat up, perking her ears up and eyes growing wide at the familiar voice growing closer and closer. She rushed out of bed and Wolfie shot after her like a bullet and she hurried out to the entrance, squinting and seeing none other than Ezra, storming up the drive way with her dad hot on his trail, demanding that he get off his property.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Lucy!&rdquo; He said when he saw her, running up to where she was standing, her eyes welled up at the image of him. God, he was beautiful, but he had hurt her so much. Wolfie was barking and her dad was shouting at him to stay back, and Ezra was pleading with her, it was a fucking mess.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you dare touch my daughter!&rdquo; Her dad shouted, standing between them, pushing him back as Ezra reached out to her.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Dad, s&rsquo;alright. I think we need to have a talk.&rdquo; She said softly and he looked back at her with wild eyes. Wolfie took a sniff at him and calmed when he recognized the scent.</p><p>\t&ldquo;I told you!&rdquo; Ezra said, standing with more confidence.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Call for me if you need me, I&rsquo;ll be right inside.&rdquo; Her dad said before he called Wolfie back inside and she sat on the steps to that led to the porch, sighing and he followed suit.</p><p>\t&ldquo;How&rsquo;d you get in?&rdquo; She asked.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Said it was a package for you&hellip;&rdquo; he said before chuckling and Lucy managed a giggle despite the ache in her chest. She was feeling it more now that Harry wasn&rsquo;t nearby and that the one who caused her all the pain was right beside her, she could feel the warmth of his skin radiating onto her bare arms.</p><p>\t&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve told him he should get a camera&hellip; he&rsquo;s a gullible guy.&rdquo; She said and he chuckled. Her breath hitched in her throat when his hand landed on hers and squeezed over it.</p><p>\t&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry for everything I said before. I love you.&rdquo; He said, searching in her eyes for a response, but she just pulled her hand away, it didn&rsquo;t feel like Harry&rsquo;s. &ldquo;I know I fucked up, but I need you. I really do love you and I&rsquo;ve been going insane without you.&rdquo; He said and she sighed.</p><p>\t&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t work, Ezra. It may have been a while back, but the things you did&hellip; I can&rsquo;t trust you and you never did a good job of earning it back. Besides, I&rsquo;m so much busier now and have a million things to do when this tour ends, it&rsquo;s impossible.&rdquo; She said and he shook his head as she stood, ready to end the conversation, he did the same.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Babe, come on.&rdquo; He pleaded.</p><p>\t&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not your babe or anything anymore. Thanks for coming and saying sorry, but I don&rsquo;t&hellip; love you anymore.&rdquo; She said softly and his eyes narrowed.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Are you with someone else?&rdquo; He bellowed.</p><p>\t&ldquo;No! I&rsquo;m just over this!&rdquo; She signaled between them. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not the fucking cheater here!&rdquo; She argued back, not afraid to stand up for herself anymore, she didn&rsquo;t need this. She didn&rsquo;t deserve <i>this</i>. </p><p>\t&ldquo;Tell me you don&rsquo;t miss this.&rdquo; He said taking her hands, gripping them tight, she couldn&rsquo;t pull back. &ldquo;Or this&hellip;&rdquo; he said wrapping his arms around her and pulling her in, pressing his lips to hers, she thrashed her head around, hating the feeling of his lips on hers, tears ran down her face as she tried to pull back because it wasn&rsquo;t Harry.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Get the fuck away from my daughter, you son of a bitch!&rdquo; Her dad burst through the door with a broom, he was caught off guard for a moment and she shoved him away, wiping her mouth on the back of her hand. </p><p>\t&ldquo;Please, just go and don&rsquo;t contact me again. We&rsquo;re done, Ezra.&rdquo; She stated flatly and he shook his head before flipping them off.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Get him out!&rdquo; Her dad shouted to Wolfie and Wolfie chased him down the long drive way until he was out the gate. Lucy&rsquo;s dad jumped, startled as she burst into laughter through her tears, trying to catch her breath, wheezing and he started laughing, too.</p><p>\t&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; He asked between fits and she shook her head, wiping a tear from her eye as she caught her breath.</p><p>\t&ldquo;You came out with a freaking broom!&rdquo; She said hugging him tight as they laughed again.</p><p>\t&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have a gun!&rdquo; He said laughing and she shook her head. &ldquo;Get inside, I was in the middle of making pancakes when this asshole showed up, probably all cold by now.&rdquo; He complained.</p><p>\tThat was the highlight of her week and it was killing her not to call Harry and tell him the story, but she was trying her best to wait. The week was almost over, and although she was sad to be leaving her dad again, she would be seeing Harry soon.</p><p>-</p><p>-</p><p>-</p><p>\tTo say that the rest of the week flew by was an understatement; Lucy was anxious to see Harry. As he had suggested, they didn&rsquo;t talk all week except for the picture she promised him of herself with Wolfie, her lovable doberman. Her flight would be landing earlier than the bands because as part of the roadie crew, she had to go and set up the arena. She had arrived two days before the show, they spent part of that afternoon and a large part of the next day setting up in the arena. Lucy spent the evening before the show in her hotel room reading. She knew they&rsquo;d be arriving tonight, she wasn&rsquo;t exactly sure at what time, but when it hit 9pm she got ready for bed and dimmed the lights, just a bit disappointed they hadn&rsquo;t arrived yet. She continued reading until the words started blurring together and the lines started shifting on the page and finally until she just couldn&rsquo;t keep her eyes open anymore.</p><p>\tLucy groaned at the familiar sound of her phone ringing, she reached for it on the night stand, answering quickly.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Hello?&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a surprise for you.&rdquo; The familiar voice said and she shot up, her heart hammering in her chest at Harry&rsquo;s voice. </p><p>\t&ldquo;Harry?&rdquo; She asked into a yawn and he chuckled.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Yeah, s&rsquo;me! Come to your door!&rdquo; He urged.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Okay, m&rsquo;coming!&rdquo; She chirped excitedly.</p><p>\tShe hurried to the bathroom and gargled some mouth wash as fast as she could, which woke her up enough and bolted for the door. When she turned it open and saw him standing there it felt like her heart was going to beat out of her chest as they beamed at each other. Her skin was buzzing, itching to touch his skin. He practically charged her, hugging around her waist and picking her up, stepping past the door and kicking it closed as his lips found hers easily, despite the dark. He was overwhelmed with joy and warmth at the feeling of her in his arms. Her lips were nice and soft for him, eagerly opening up as he dipped his tongue into her mouth and tasted her after what had seemed like ages. He groaned at the way she was sweet on his tongue and how her hands wove into the hair at the back of his head, carding through it gently. She pulled back to take a breath and pressed a quick kiss at the corner of his mouth, panting as she burrowed herself in his neck, loving his familiar scent.</p><p>\t&ldquo;I missed you so much.&rdquo; She mumbled into his throat, his heart pumping faster when she kissed him right under his jaw, just one little kiss, but it did things to him.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Me too, love. Now, let me show you your surprise.&rdquo; He said letting her down and she grinned up at him, taking his hand and pulling him to the bed, the dim lamp still giving the room a nice glow. She took a seat on the bed as he pulled his journal out from his bag before setting it down. He couldn&rsquo;t stop smiling and neither could she, she was buzzing with excitement.</p><p>\t&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; She asked impatiently and he chuckled, opening the cover.</p><p>\t&ldquo;In my hands, I have for you the original journal entry of the lyrics for <i>Olivia.</i>&rdquo; Her eyes grew wide as he pulled out a loose page from right inside the cover.</p><p>\t&ldquo;No way.&rdquo; She asked in disbelief, mouth dropping open, eyes going wide.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Yes way.&rdquo; He said smiling, relishing in her reaction, he wanted to kiss her all over again. &ldquo;I had to go through about six of my journals to find it.&rdquo; He said as he handed the page to her and she took it gently, her eyes going soft as she looked over his handwriting.\t</p><p>\t&ldquo;But why? This is so special, Harry. You didn&rsquo;t have to.&rdquo; She nearly whispered, looking up into his eyes and he shrugged, a smile making its way onto his face.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Because you loved the song and I knew that when I got to see you after the break I would be just as happy as I was when I wrote this song. Well actually, I think I&rsquo;m happier now that I&rsquo;m here with you.&rdquo; He said and her heart just about melted as she looked down at the page again. There were scribbles in the margins about instrumentation and little doodles of butterflies and flowers&hellip;it was so perfectly <i>him.</i></p><p>\t&ldquo;That&rsquo;s another thing I love about you&hellip; your art.&rdquo; She said glancing back up into his eyes, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s probably my favorite thing about you.&rdquo; She confessed and he felt his heart racing as fast as the speed of light. He was melted butter with her words, he felt loved and important, and cherished. He held her face in his hands as he pressed his lips to hers once more. This time it wasn&rsquo;t as rushed, it was meaningful and emotional. &ldquo;Wait, wait, wait, wait.&rdquo; She mumbled against his lips.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Hmmm?&rdquo; He asked, pulling back.\t</p><p>\t&ldquo;Need t&rsquo;put this somewhere safe!&rdquo; She said of the little page in her hands and he smiled. She hurried to her luggage and pulled out her lap top; he watched as she pulled it out of the case and set it on the bed, popping off the bottom cover and neatly laying the page there before settling the laptop back into the cover and then putting it away again. She walked back over to him and just hugged him to her, his head resting on her chest and she pulled back. &ldquo;Thank you. S&rsquo;the best gift I&rsquo;ve ever received.&rdquo; She said and he smiled nuzzling back into her. &ldquo;Are you ready for bed?&rdquo; She asked and he shook his head. &ldquo;Do that, yeah? Then we can snuggle. I have thee funniest story to tell you&hellip; I almost called you over the break just to tell you.&rdquo; She said and he grinned.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t wait.&rdquo;</p></p>",
