His hands were buried deep in the pockets of his old\ncoat that could barely keep him warm. He had a scarf wrapped around his pale\nneck and a beanie covered most of his brown, soft curls. His nose was pink and\nrunny, sniffing every now and then, and he could see his breath. Peter hated\nthe cold- he felt like it was the perfect time to stay indoors and sleep\nforever like a little spider- not to go outside and suffer.</p><p>He finally stopped\nwhen he reached a small caf\u00e9 and his eyes lit up. He stepped inside eagerly,\nfeelings the tension leave his shoulders as the warmth embraced his body. He let out a\nsmall sigh and his lips curled into a shy smile as he looked around for something-\nor someone, until he finally fount it </p><p>At a small table, next\nto a floor to ceiling window, Peter spotted a man sipping his espresso calmly.\nThe boy didn\u2019t hesitate to rush over with a bright, wide smile. </p><p>\u201cTony!\u201d he chirped and\nthe man raised his glance from the small, white cup with steam floating out of\nit, greeting the boy with a smile. \u201cHey sweetheart, you finally got here\u201d He\nchuckled and stood up, stepping closer to the boy. He placed a soft kiss on his\nlips, making Peter blush and giggle which was- <i>the cutest fucking thing</i>. Tony\npulled away and unwrapped the scarf from the boy\u2019s neck, then pulled his beanie\noff and Peter shoved them in the pockets of his coat- which he then laid neatly\non the back of his chair. He was about to sit down, but before he could do so,\nTony pulled him against his chest and cupped his cheeks, the man\u2019s lips curling\ninto a smirk. He gently ran his thumb over Peter\u2019s bottom lip before grabbing\nhis chin</p><p>\u201cBaby your lips are so\ncold\u2026should I warm them up?\u201d He asked with a cocky grin and leaned in to kiss\nthem again, this time for a while longer. Peter was a flushed mess, asking\nhimself if this whole scenario was even real- </p><p>Tony pulled away when\nthe other wrapped his hands around his neck just so he could look at the boy\u2019s\nexpression. And it was so goddamn precious- Peter\u2019s parted lips were pink, very\nsoft (<i>Tony noted</i>), his cheeks were red and his eyes were widened and sparkling\nwith joy.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cLook, your face is all warm now\u201d He chuckled and kissed his forehead\nbefore pulling away to sit down, and the boy did the same, a bit embarrassed but\nvery happy and excited nonetheless. </p><p>\u201cYou know Tony, you\u2019re\nvery cheesy and romantic for a billionaire playboy\u201d \u2013 Peter teased </p><p>\u201cDo you want me to\nstop?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell no\u201d </p><p>And they laughed. They\nchatted, flirted, ordered a cappuccino and another espresso to enjoy while they\nwere spending some quality time together, held hands over the table, complemented each\nother like two lovesick dorks (because that\u2019s what they were) and this morning\ncouldn\u2019t have been better for either of them. </p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1024\" data-orig-width=\"1024\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/41d40e5cfdfbd1847501c89bba595073/tumblr_inline_pncivpr0qR1val9bc_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"1024\" data-orig-width=\"1024\"/></figure>",

An incredible mind had been inherited from your father, that he got from his father, and it seemed that with each new generation, you Starks only got smarter. It set an expectation for you the second you were born. </p><!-- more --><p>But right now that expectation was overwhelming. It felt out of reach. It felt impossible. From a really young age you knew your dad was a genius, and every so often someone would mention Howard- your grandfather, and how smart he was as well, and everyone made a comment on how they expected the same, if not more, from little you. You wanted to satisfy their expectations. You wanted to satisfy your father\u2019s expectations. You wanted to be a household name, you wanted to make your father proud. That had been your goal for so long, trying to hard- so hard that you got into this school, surrounded by other genius kids. </p><p>Recently you\u2019d been looking around. Looking at your peers. A big part of you expected you to be the best in each class, to be the ideal student with exceptional grades, better than your peers. But you were struggling. Sure, you weren\u2019t lagging behind, but you weren\u2019t ahead. In each class there was always at least a small handful of students that you felt you had to compete with to get a better grade with. When you got the same grade as them, even if it was the highest grade you could get, it didn\u2019t feel good enough. It didn\u2019t feel good enough for a Stark. </p><p>You didn\u2019t feel good enough. </p><p>These thoughts soon manifested into actions as you started to believe these words your mind had made. You thought \u2018what was the point?\u2019 and stopped competing. You didn\u2019t try as hard as you used to. The perfect grades slipped, and it got noticed.</p><p>On the weekend, Tony got a call from the school, saying they were worried about you, since your grades were slipping and you didn\u2019t seem as passionate as you used to be. Tony promised he\u2019d look into it, and he did so immediately. </p><p>You heard the gentle knock on your bedroom door, and your heart did pick up, but you were too tired to look up as the door opened. You were tired both physically and mentally, feeling drained with every day you had to spend in that school. You were trying to regain that energy, but it didn\u2019t seem to be coming back. \u201cY/N?\u201d Your father\u2019s voice called calmly. You turned over in your bed sheets, seeing your dad now coming over, sitting down on the edge of your bed. \u201cSit up for me, please.\u201d </p><p>You did as told silently. You had a good idea on what this was about already. School. Your grades. Were you getting kicked out of school? Were you in trouble? That ached your heart, and while you felt like you weren\u2019t smart enough, you sure as hell didn\u2019t want to let your dad down, and for him to be disappointed in you. \u201cAm I in trouble?\u201d You asked quietly. </p><p>\u201cWhy would you be in trouble?\u201d </p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m failing.\u201d You answered, willingly admitting your guilt and crime. Tony sighed, shuffling closer. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not failing, Y/N. You\u2019ve gone down a grade in some classes, but they\u2019re the second highest grades you can get- that\u2019s not failing.\u201d </p><p>\u201cBut\u2026 I\u2019m a Stark.\u201d You tried to explain. Tony looked at you, seeing the guilt, and seeing your face slowly showing some upset. \u201cI don\u2019t want to disappoint you or anything but it\u2019s so tiring and it\u2019s so difficult and sometimes it feels like it\u2019s all for nothing- and I\u2019m struggling to keep up with other kids in my class, and I don\u2019t feel special, and I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m doing you proud and-\u201d </p><p>\u201cHey, hey, hey!\u201d Tony interrupted, pulling you close to him in a hug. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, yeah? You\u2019re my daughter. You don\u2019t have to prove you\u2019re a Stark. You\u2019re born one. And what\u2019s that about being a disappointment? You could never disappoint me darling. Everyday you make me proud because you\u2019re doing so much better than me when I was your age. When I was your age, I was on purposely failing just to spite my dad. But you? Everyday you blow my mind. Don\u2019t worry about finding it difficult in school to get the perfect grades. School\u2019s meant to be difficult, and you\u2019re in the top classes, it\u2019s meant to be hard. If you find it hard but you\u2019re still pushing forward, then that means you\u2019re learning and becoming more amazing everyday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2026\u201d He heard your voice starting to shake, and he looked down at you as you looked up. \u201cIt\u2019s so tiring dad. I\u2019m just drained.\u201d You expressed. Tony smiled sadly. He thought for a second. </p><p>\u201cHey\u2026 you\u2019ve never had a day off school\u2026 I\u2019m sure they won\u2019t mind a week or two away. In that time we\u2019re gonna go out and do things that make you happy, and if you\u2019re feeling like this again, please tell me, and we\u2019ll figure out how to make you feel better, alright?\u201d Tony planned. A small smiled appeared from you, and you nodded. He kissed the top of your head. \u201cGood. Now come on, get dressed, our adventure starts today.\u201d </p><hr><p>Hope you like it!

It set an expectation for you the second you were born. </p>[[MORE]]<p>But right now that expectation was overwhelming. It felt out of reach. It felt impossible. From a really young age you knew your dad was a genius, and every so often someone would mention Howard- your grandfather, and how smart he was as well, and everyone made a comment on how they expected the same, if not more, from little you. You wanted to satisfy their expectations. You wanted to satisfy your father\u2019s expectations. You wanted to be a household name, you wanted to make your father proud. That had been your goal for so long, trying to hard- so hard that you got into this school, surrounded by other genius kids. </p><p>Recently you\u2019d been looking around. Looking at your peers. A big part of you expected you to be the best in each class, to be the ideal student with exceptional grades, better than your peers. But you were struggling. Sure, you weren\u2019t lagging behind, but you weren\u2019t ahead. In each class there was always at least a small handful of students that you felt you had to compete with to get a better grade with. When you got the same grade as them, even if it was the highest grade you could get, it didn\u2019t feel good enough. It didn\u2019t feel good enough for a Stark. </p><p>You didn\u2019t feel good enough. </p><p>These thoughts soon manifested into actions as you started to believe these words your mind had made. You thought \u2018what was the point?\u2019 and stopped competing. You didn\u2019t try as hard as you used to. The perfect grades slipped, and it got noticed.</p><p>On the weekend, Tony got a call from the school, saying they were worried about you, since your grades were slipping and you didn\u2019t seem as passionate as you used to be. Tony promised he\u2019d look into it, and he did so immediately. </p><p>You heard the gentle knock on your bedroom door, and your heart did pick up, but you were too tired to look up as the door opened. You were tired both physically and mentally, feeling drained with every day you had to spend in that school. You were trying to regain that energy, but it didn\u2019t seem to be coming back. \u201cY/N?\u201d Your father\u2019s voice called calmly. You turned over in your bed sheets, seeing your dad now coming over, sitting down on the edge of your bed. \u201cSit up for me, please.\u201d </p><p>You did as told silently. You had a good idea on what this was about already. School. Your grades. Were you getting kicked out of school? Were you in trouble? That ached your heart, and while you felt like you weren\u2019t smart enough, you sure as hell didn\u2019t want to let your dad down, and for him to be disappointed in you. \u201cAm I in trouble?\u201d You asked quietly. </p><p>\u201cWhy would you be in trouble?\u201d </p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m failing.\u201d You answered, willingly admitting your guilt and crime. Tony sighed, shuffling closer. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not failing, Y/N. You\u2019ve gone down a grade in some classes, but they\u2019re the second highest grades you can get- that\u2019s not failing.\u201d </p><p>\u201cBut\u2026 I\u2019m a Stark.\u201d You tried to explain. Tony looked at you, seeing the guilt, and seeing your face slowly showing some upset. \u201cI don\u2019t want to disappoint you or anything but it\u2019s so tiring and it\u2019s so difficult and sometimes it feels like it\u2019s all for nothing- and I\u2019m struggling to keep up with other kids in my class, and I don\u2019t feel special, and I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m doing you proud and-\u201d </p><p>\u201cHey, hey, hey!\u201d Tony interrupted, pulling you close to him in a hug. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, yeah? You\u2019re my daughter. You don\u2019t have to prove you\u2019re a Stark. You\u2019re born one. And what\u2019s that about being a disappointment? You could never disappoint me darling. Everyday you make me proud because you\u2019re doing so much better than me when I was your age. When I was your age, I was on purposely failing just to spite my dad. But you? Everyday you blow my mind. Don\u2019t worry about finding it difficult in school to get the perfect grades. School\u2019s meant to be difficult, and you\u2019re in the top classes, it\u2019s meant to be hard. If you find it hard but you\u2019re still pushing forward, then that means you\u2019re learning and becoming more amazing everyday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2026\u201d He heard your voice starting to shake, and he looked down at you as you looked up. \u201cIt\u2019s so tiring dad. I\u2019m just drained.\u201d You expressed. Tony smiled sadly. He thought for a second. </p><p>\u201cHey\u2026 you\u2019ve never had a day off school\u2026 I\u2019m sure they won\u2019t mind a week or two away. In that time we\u2019re gonna go out and do things that make you happy, and if you\u2019re feeling like this again, please tell me, and we\u2019ll figure out how to make you feel better, alright?\u201d Tony planned. A small smiled appeared from you, and you nodded. He kissed the top of your head. \u201cGood. Now come on, get dressed, our adventure starts today.\u201d </p><hr><p>Hope you like it!
