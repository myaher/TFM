Sansa is the Lady of Winterfell and knows the Northerners are looking at Jon like Torrhen Stark (the King Who Knelt) right now, and are withdrawing support. They think they\u2019re just going to get fucked over again like what happened with Robb. She\u2019s looking out for her family and her people. At the same time, Dany left her campaign to fight Cersei and take King\u2019s Landing, saved Jon and company\u2019s asses beyond the Wall (<i>before </i>he bent the knee, mind you), lost one of her children (Viserion) and has turned her sights to helping save the North. She\u2019s risking her life, her peoples\u2019 lives (Dothraki, Unsullied, Missandei, etc.) and her two remaining dragons\u2019 lives to help save the world.\u00a0</p><p>As D&amp;D confirmed in the Inside the Episode after the show, Daenerys is understandably upset and frustrated that she\u2019s being met with such opposition, but this isn\u2019t really anything new to her. She probably just expected the family of the man she loves to be a little more welcoming. She\u2019s used to having to be more aggressive in order to gain respect (which seems to be a common struggle among female rulers in a patriarchal society such as this). The Dothraki, for example, don\u2019t respect or follow someone because they love them or because they have a certain name - they follow someone based on strength. The Iron Born are similar. Dany isn\u2019t used to having to be soft with people in order to gain their respect. She tries this off the bat with Sansa and it backfires, so I think her default is to whip out that straight-backed, fire and blood mentality. Should she have executed the Tarlys? Probably Randyll, maybe not Dickon. But she can\u2019t do anything about that now. She fucked up. And as Jon pointed out, he has executed men for disobeying him for less, <i>and</i> he wasn\u2019t even a king. I personally am tired of all the men in this story being excused and held to a lesser standard for essentially doing the same kind of stuff.\u00a0</p><p>But basically that scene with Jon was trying to get him to understand that this isn\u2019t some game of\u00a0\u201cOh Sansa doesn\u2019t like anyone, lol\u201d because I think Jon can be a little daft sometimes. Dany is basically trying to get him to understand that if Sansa can\u2019t show her respect, especially in public, how does he expect any of those tough Northern lords to ever respect her? If they win this war with the NK and Dany puts herself and everyone else she loves at risk, should she just be okay with having saved a bunch of people who will turn their backs on her? She isn\u2019t a martyr and I think it\u2019s unreasonable to expect her to be. It\u2019s unreasonable to ask her to give everything to help these people and not have their respect or loyalty in return.\u00a0</p><p>Further, Daenerys clearly loves Jon, and he loves her. And in a recent interview Emilia talked about how Dany trusts Jon and listens to him and values his opinion. Why would she ever harm Sansa? Why would she ever harm a family member of the man she loves? It doesn\u2019t make sense to make her a villain now, especially considering how we are repeatedly told that the North needs Dany. Her destiny is to help save the world and that is what she\u2019s trying to do. I hope Dany and Sansa can at least meet somewhere in the middle, because I honestly think they\u2019re pretty similar and could actually learn a lot from each other.\u00a0</p><p>Besides, we already have enough traditional villains. The Night King, Cersei, Euron, etc. Those are the things we should be worrying about. We <i>should</i> be worried about the<b> real</b> Mad Queen who is seemingly just <i>delighted</i> that the NK and his army have taken down the Wall.
