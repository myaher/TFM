I never thought I&rsquo;d meet someone who would make my stomach turn to knots, and yet here he was, in the produce section fustrated with a screaming child who was probably no older than 2. </p><p>&ldquo;What! Tell me what you want!!&rdquo; He raised his voice as the child started kicking him. I walked up to them and put my hand on the cute strangers back.</p><p>&ldquo;Having trouble?&rdquo; I smiled at him softly and he sighed in response. &ldquo;I dont know what she wants she just keeps screaming&rdquo; i looked at the little girl who was still screaming. </p><p>&ldquo;How old is she? Is she teething?&rdquo; I questioned and the boy looked like he had an   epiphany. &ldquo;Oh my gosh! I love you! Youre brilliant!&rdquo; I laughed and rubbed the back of my neck as he rummaged through his bag and pulled out a teething ring handing it to the toddler. I glanced down at his hand and noticed he didnt have a ring, so he probably wasnt married.</p><p>&ldquo;Not used to your girlfriend leaving you with the baby?&rdquo; He looked at me confused and then his eyes went wide. &ldquo;Huh? Oh! No! Nonono! Im not- Shes not mine. Lydia is my cousin, Im babysitting while my aunt and uncle are out.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh I see an act of thoughtfulness&rdquo; I smiled at him, fully knowing I was bright red. He was really cute, apart of me wanted to ask for his number but I wasnt even sure he liked guys. </p><p>&ldquo;Oh Im TJ by the way, nice to meet you&rdquo; I put my hand out and smiled. He took my hand and shook it and I felt my heart jump &ldquo;Cyrus,  nice to meet you&rdquo; i pulled my hand away and started to look at the tomatoes at the same time as Cyrus. We reached for the same tomatoes and ended up holding hands again. I laughed softly. </p><p>&ldquo;So Cyrus, do you have a girlfriend? I find it hard to believe that you&rsquo;re single&rdquo; Cyrus turned red and laughed. &ldquo;Um no actually I&rsquo;m pretty single. Im not- uh Yeah Im not seeing anyone&rdquo; He became flustered and I felt bad for pushing. &ldquo;Oh yeah me neither, my parents keep trying to set me up with girls but&hellip;.&rdquo; I trailed off and continued to look at the tomatoes. &ldquo;But..? But what?&rdquo; He was a curious person, I chuckled. &ldquo;Well&hellip; Lets just say Ive never been that into girls&rdquo; He looked up at me wide eyed, &ldquo;Yeah me either&rdquo; I smiled, I guess he was into guys. We fell into silence and continued to gather our groceries </p><p>&ldquo;Um hey, Cyrus?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So I dont- I dont know if youd be interested.. and you- you don&rsquo;t have to bu-but maybe youd like want to meet up again this friday and get like coffee.. maybe dinner or something&rdquo; I was flustered and my face was bright red as I looked over at Cyrus waiting a response. </p><p>&ldquo;Are you asking me on a date?&rdquo; Cyrus replied flirtatiously with a smile on his face. </p><p>&ldquo;I uh- yeah..

I never thought I&rsquo;d meet someone who would make my stomach turn to knots, and yet here he was, in the produce section fustrated with a screaming child who was probably no older than 2. </p><p>&ldquo;What! Tell me what you want!!&rdquo; He raised his voice as the child started kicking him. I walked up to them and put my hand on the cute strangers back.</p><p>&ldquo;Having trouble?&rdquo; I smiled at him softly and he sighed in response. &ldquo;I dont know what she wants she just keeps screaming&rdquo; i looked at the little girl who was still screaming. </p><p>&ldquo;How old is she? Is she teething?&rdquo; I questioned and the boy looked like he had an   epiphany. &ldquo;Oh my gosh! I love you! Youre brilliant!&rdquo; I laughed and rubbed the back of my neck as he rummaged through his bag and pulled out a teething ring handing it to the toddler. I glanced down at his hand and noticed he didnt have a ring, so he probably wasnt married.</p><p>&ldquo;Not used to your girlfriend leaving you with the baby?&rdquo; He looked at me confused and then his eyes went wide. &ldquo;Huh? Oh! No! Nonono! Im not- Shes not mine. Lydia is my cousin, Im babysitting while my aunt and uncle are out.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh I see an act of thoughtfulness&rdquo; I smiled at him, fully knowing I was bright red. He was really cute, apart of me wanted to ask for his number but I wasnt even sure he liked guys. </p><p>&ldquo;Oh Im TJ by the way, nice to meet you&rdquo; I put my hand out and smiled. He took my hand and shook it and I felt my heart jump &ldquo;Cyrus,  nice to meet you&rdquo; i pulled my hand away and started to look at the tomatoes at the same time as Cyrus. We reached for the same tomatoes and ended up holding hands again. I laughed softly. </p><p>&ldquo;So Cyrus, do you have a girlfriend? I find it hard to believe that you&rsquo;re single&rdquo; Cyrus turned red and laughed. &ldquo;Um no actually I&rsquo;m pretty single. Im not- uh Yeah Im not seeing anyone&rdquo; He became flustered and I felt bad for pushing. &ldquo;Oh yeah me neither, my parents keep trying to set me up with girls but&hellip;.&rdquo; I trailed off and continued to look at the tomatoes. &ldquo;But..?

Have a nice day! \ud83d\udc9a</p><p>A bright warm sunlight settled over the park as Tj sat on a bench, waiting for Cyrus to show up. The swift summer breeze cut through Tj, making him shiver. Tj pulled the arms of his hoodie down, hiding the goosebumps he had. Tj wasn&rsquo;t even that cold, he was just nervous, or scared. He couldn&rsquo;t decide which one.</p><p>Cyrus walked through the park&rsquo;s entrance, well more like ran. Cyrus walked past the swings, breathing heavily. The swings were their place, they met there. So what if it was because Cyrus was singing his stupid swing song. It didn&rsquo;t matter, not to Cyrus or Tj. They really connected that time, but not as much as the second time. The second time was like a movie scene without the kiss. Cyrus wished he could go back to that moment and close the gap between him and Tj. I mean he could&rsquo;ve at least told Tj he was gay, but he wasn&rsquo;t ready. Maybe he would be soon, hopefully.</p><p>Cyrus stumbled to the bench where Tj sat. Tj grabbed Cyrus&rsquo;s shoulders before he could fall face first into the bench. Cyrus&rsquo;s breath hitched for a moment because of Tj&rsquo;s touch. Both of the boys faces had a pink tint to them. Cyrus repositioned himself and sat on the bench, Tj&rsquo;s arm was still around him.</p><p>&ldquo;Sorry I&rsquo;m late Tj! Buffy wanted me to help her pick out her outfit for the wedding and I couldn&rsquo;t say no!&rdquo; Cyrus spoke so fast that all Tj could focus on was his lips. If only Tj could kiss those lips right here, right now. Cyrus sat in silence waiting for Tj to respond.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re fine&hellip;&rdquo; Tj mumbled not taking his eyes off of Cyrus&rsquo;s totally kissable lips. He was right, it was fine, it gave Tj more time to figure out what he was going to say. What was Tj going to confess to Cyrus? This question pulled Tj out of his daze.</p><p>&ldquo;Cyrus I need to tell you something&hellip; important.&rdquo; Tj took his arm off of Cyrus&rsquo;s shoulder, Cyrus immediately missed it&rsquo;s warmth. Tj stared at his sneakers, trying to find the words to say.</p><p>&ldquo;What is it? Are you okay?&rdquo; Cyrus&rsquo;s heart dropped when he saw Tj speechless. Tj always had something to say, why not now? Cyrus wanted to pull Tj into the biggest bear hug, but he didn&rsquo;t. </p><p>&ldquo;I&hellip;I don&rsquo;t know how to say this.&rdquo; Tears started to form in Tj&rsquo;s big green eyes, but he blinked them away. Cyrus grabbed Tj&rsquo;s shaky hand, &ldquo;Tj&hellip; you can tell me anything.&rdquo;</p><p>Tj took a deep breath and tried to calm himself down. Cyrus squeezed his hand, causing Tj to look up at Cyrus&rsquo;s longing brown eyes. Tj got lost in them for a moment, until the tears came back and blurred his eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;Cyrus&hellip; I&rsquo;m gay.&rdquo; Tj&rsquo;s voice broke and a single tear streamed down his face and landed on Cyrus&rsquo;s hand. It was Cyrus&rsquo;s turn to cry. Cyrus rubbed his thumb along Tj&rsquo;s knuckles.</p><p>&ldquo;Me too.&rdquo; Cyrus chocked out, feeling a weight being lifted off his shoulders. Tj&rsquo;s gaze instantly landed on Cyrus&rsquo;s glossy eyes. A smile formed on each others faces. Tj quickly pulled Cyrus into a big hug. They held eachother as if a gust of wind would sweep the other away.</p><p>&ldquo;It is because of me?&rdquo; Tj whispered into Cyrus&rsquo;s ear. Cyrus instantly stiffened up, feeling his face get hot. </p><p>&ldquo;You really have to feed your ego right now?&rdquo; Cyrus chuckled rubbing Tj&rsquo;s back. Tj pulled away from the hug, overall regretting it because he was cold now.</p><p>&ldquo;Is that a yes?&rdquo; Tj questioned, hoping he didnt just make a fool of himself. Cyrus stared deeply into Tj&rsquo;s eyes. A small grin formed on his face as he intertwined his fingers with Tj&rsquo;s.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;</p>",

Have a nice day! \ud83d\udc9a</p><p>A bright warm sunlight settled over the park as Tj sat on a bench, waiting for Cyrus to show up. The swift summer breeze cut through Tj, making him shiver. Tj pulled the arms of his hoodie down, hiding the goosebumps he had. Tj wasn\u2019t even that cold, he was just nervous, or scared. He couldn\u2019t decide which one.</p><p>Cyrus walked through the park\u2019s entrance, well more like ran. Cyrus walked past the swings, breathing heavily. The swings were their place, they met there. So what if it was because Cyrus was singing his stupid swing song. It didn\u2019t matter, not to Cyrus or Tj. They really connected that time, but not as much as the second time. The second time was like a movie scene without the kiss. Cyrus wished he could go back to that moment and close the gap between him and Tj. I mean he could\u2019ve at least told Tj he was gay, but he wasn\u2019t ready. Maybe he would be soon, hopefully.</p><p>Cyrus stumbled to the bench where Tj sat. Tj grabbed Cyrus\u2019s shoulders before he could fall face first into the bench. Cyrus\u2019s breath hitched for a moment because of Tj\u2019s touch. Both of the boys faces had a pink tint to them. Cyrus repositioned himself and sat on the bench, Tj\u2019s arm was still around him.</p><p>\u201cSorry I\u2019m late Tj! Buffy wanted me to help her pick out her outfit for the wedding and I couldn\u2019t say no!\u201d Cyrus spoke so fast that all Tj could focus on was his lips. If only Tj could kiss those lips right here, right now. Cyrus sat in silence waiting for Tj to respond.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re fine\u2026\u201d Tj mumbled not taking his eyes off of Cyrus\u2019s totally kissable lips. He was right, it was fine, it gave Tj more time to figure out what he was going to say. What was Tj going to confess to Cyrus? This question pulled Tj out of his daze.</p><p>\u201cCyrus I need to tell you something\u2026 important.\u201d Tj took his arm off of Cyrus\u2019s shoulder, Cyrus immediately missed it\u2019s warmth. Tj stared at his sneakers, trying to find the words to say.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it? Are you okay?\u201d Cyrus\u2019s heart dropped when he saw Tj speechless. Tj always had something to say, why not now? Cyrus wanted to pull Tj into the biggest bear hug, but he didn\u2019t. </p><p>\u201cI\u2026I don\u2019t know how to say this.\u201d Tears started to form in Tj\u2019s big green eyes, but he blinked them away. Cyrus grabbed Tj\u2019s shaky hand, \u201cTj\u2026 you can tell me anything.\u201d</p><p>Tj took a deep breath and tried to calm himself down. Cyrus squeezed his hand, causing Tj to look up at Cyrus\u2019s longing brown eyes. Tj got lost in them for a moment, until the tears came back and blurred his eyes.</p><p>\u201cCyrus\u2026 I\u2019m gay.\u201d Tj\u2019s voice broke and a single tear streamed down his face and landed on Cyrus\u2019s hand. It was Cyrus\u2019s turn to cry. Cyrus rubbed his thumb along Tj\u2019s knuckles.</p><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d Cyrus chocked out, feeling a weight being lifted off his shoulders. Tj\u2019s gaze instantly landed on Cyrus\u2019s glossy eyes. A smile formed on each others faces. Tj quickly pulled Cyrus into a big hug. They held eachother as if a gust of wind would sweep the other away.</p><p>\u201cIt is because of me?\u201d Tj whispered into Cyrus\u2019s ear. Cyrus instantly stiffened up, feeling his face get hot. </p><p>\u201cYou really have to feed your ego right now?\u201d Cyrus chuckled rubbing Tj\u2019s back. Tj pulled away from the hug, overall regretting it because he was cold now.</p><p>\u201cIs that a yes?\u201d Tj questioned, hoping he didnt just make a fool of himself. Cyrus stared deeply into Tj\u2019s eyes. A small grin formed on his face as he intertwined his fingers with Tj\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d</p></p>",
