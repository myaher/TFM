She\u2019d never answered by the tree, and she still wasn\u2019t sure she knew how.</p><p>She stood up anyway, awkwardly picking up one of her extra blankets from where it had fallen in a heap in another corner, as they moved her bed.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d she said, walking over to him and draping it over him, \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t - you don\u2019t have to be cold.\u201d</p><p>He reached up, fast as anything, just like always, and grabbed her wrist, looking up intently into her eyes. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Something tugged, hard, at her heart, pulling at her chest, but this wasn\u2019t - there was something in his eyes, but whatever the pull was he wasn\u2019t doing it. It wasn\u2019t him. It was her.</p><p>He held on for a moment longer, a moment too long, and they both knew it, and she was glad, and she wasn\u2019t sure if he knew that part or not.</p><p>She pulled away, sighing. \u201cNo, just. Wait. Wait there.\u201d</p><p>Rolling up her bedroll and gathering up her blankets would have been awkward enough, just now, even without his eyes still on her, without the feeling of his gaze resting on her back, but she kept breathing and ignored it, and then everything was lumped up together in her arms and she walked back toward him.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d she said, \u201cScoot over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKiki-\u201d</p><p>\u201cScoot over.\u201d She wasn\u2019t used to giving orders, but for a moment she channeled Vex, and then felt weird about it. Vax scooted over, making room for her and then sitting up to help her arrange everything into a makeshift bed for the two of them.</p><p>He didn\u2019t quite meet her eyes as he laid back down, right at the edge of everything, and the tugging in her chest was back again, and she slid all the way up next to him, as close as she could get, sliding a hand across his side, under his arm.</p><p>He pulled her in, and she tucked her head under his chin, closing her eyes to breathe in the familiar scent of him. She wasn\u2019t used to being held, not really, not like this, and she knew Vax was still right up against the outer edge of the pile of blankets, and she tried to relax, but couldn\u2019t quite.</p><p>\u201cIs this alright?\u201d she whispered, softly.</p><p>Vax kissed the side of her head. \u201cThis is perfect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe should scoot over toward the middle, though,\u201d she said, \u201cSo you don\u2019t end up outside the blankets. Shouldn\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>Vax chuckled, a familiar warm sound accompanied by an unfamiliar new vibration as she felt it in his chest.</p><p>Scooting over was awkward, as neither of them quite moved far enough away from the other to make it efficient, and she caught his hair under her hand by accident once, just for a moment, and had to apologize, but before she tucked her head back into his chest, she caught a smile on his face, and that was - something.

It still woke her, louder in this position than she\u2019d ever heard it before, and she reached up a hand awkwardly to rest on the side of his face, casting lesser restoration into him.</p><p>His breathing quieted, still deep and slow and sleeping, but without the catch of the snore. His arms were heavy around her, sleep seemingly magnifying the weight, like it always did, but as she pushed backward to get a better look at his sleeping face, moving wasn\u2019t as hard as she\u2019d thought it might be.</p><p>He\u2019d said things she\u2019d never answered. He\u2019d done things she\u2019d never answered. He\u2019d asked a question tonight that she\u2019d only half-answered, at best, and he deserved better. He deserved better.
