painted with comical little skulls running over his scalp, as she guides a glass of water to his lips.</p><p>he passes out leaning against her, breathing following hers.</p><p>rhodey wakes him up the

strong arms beneath his knees and shoulders, and carries him to his room, it&rsquo;s the only time he thinks she might not be real. her hair is braided atop her head, tight and intricate and greying in some places.</p><p>she lets him cry into the dark fabric of her shirt and kisses the crown of his head like an apology.</p><p>he begs her to bring him his mother, like he had when he was still a child, tears in his eyes and voice desperate and broken.</p><p>he thinks she cries with him.</p><p>&mdash;</p><p>she shows up again hours after the bomb goes off, while they&rsquo;re still operating,

wakes up she&rsquo;s still there, eyes sad and tired, fingers in his hair.</p><p>she stays until he&rsquo;s nearly done with the arc reactor, a calming presence in the shadows. while yinsen&rsquo;s asleep he rests his head on her lap and sobs, asks why this is happening.</p><p>she doesn&rsquo;t answer. she never answers.</p><p>&mdash;</p><p>he&rsquo;s slumped against his desk, glass shards and blood in his hand alongside the original arc reactor, when she sweeps in with murder in her eyes. it&rsquo;s the only time he&rsquo;s ever seen her angry.</p><p>her hand, warm and dry, slips beneath his and helps him lift the glowing reactor, helps him slot it into the hole in his chest.</p><p>he gasps wetly, pain arcing through him, before he slumps back against the desk.</p><p>\u201cthank you,\u201d he whispers, watching her with tired eyes.</p><p>she smiles and nods and walks away.</p><p>&mdash;</p><p>when the lines reach his neck she comes back yet again, smelling like smoke and rain. he cries when he sees her, choking on his tears and the bitter taste of burning metal.</p><p>she hugs him, puts her chin atop his head, and speaks in a language he still can&rsquo;t understand. when she pulls away, her fingers, nails painted pure white, trace the pattern of black poison across his skin.</p><p>\u201ci\u2019m dying,\u201d he tells her, even and resigned, staring at the ceiling of his workshop.</p><p>he feels cold, the only points of warmth death\u2019s hands upon his neck. </p><p>\u201ci don&rsquo;t know what to do.\u201d</p><p>&mdash;</p><p>there&rsquo;s a bloom of fire, the explosion spreading across the vast expanse of space, engulfing the emptiness. she blinks at him from the void, takes his hand as he drifts.</p><p>fear cloys in his lungs, catching on what air he still has. she pushes him, smiling, back towards the portal. </p><p>then he&rsquo;s falling, faster and faster.</p><p>his eyes close and his heart stutters in his chest, just beneath the reactor.</p><p>&mdash;</p><p>she finds him in the bunker, just after rogers has left, and lays her hand just below where the shield had been driven into the armor. he can barely move, the suit too heavy without power, but he manages to shift the arm to lay across her foot, trying to blink away the tears in his eyes.</p><p>she speaks, and the sound is still twisted, unearthly, but he forgets to listen and can only see how her lips shape the words, \u2018i\u2019m sorry.\u2019</p><p>she disappears before he falls asleep, the cold settling deep in his bones.</p><p>&mdash;</p><p>when thanos disappears, he sees her out of the corner of his eye, skin glowing in the red light of titan. she looks the same as always, and he feels tears form in his eyes. </p><p>he can feel blood coming from the wound in his stomach, he knows why she&rsquo;s here. for once in his life he doesn&rsquo;t want to go. everything is too much for a moment, overwhelming, before he meets her eyes and shakes his head.</p><p>he seals the wound and stands up, peter\u2019s hands there to steady him.</p><p>she smiles, fond and bright, and something settles in his chest.</p><p>&mdash;</p><p><b>there&rsquo;s dust on his hands, stuck there by his blood.</b></p><p><b>he feels sick when he turns to her, tears tracking lines through the grime on his face.</b></p><p><b><i>\u201cplease,\u201d</i> he begs,
