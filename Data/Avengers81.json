I just searched for a Picture and a Gif of Bucky Barnes and ^^ are the ones I chose to use!!!!!!</b>)<br/></p><ul><li>The 2 of you met when he was the Winter Soldier and you were a HYDRA agent, and you were assigned to help him assassinate Nick Fury.</li><li>When the Washington D.C. Incident happened you knew that he had recognized Steve from his life before he was the Winter Soldier.</li><li>After the fall of HYDRA and SHIELD you went into hiding, not intending to run into the ex-Winter Soldier.</li></ul><p>You moved to Bucharest intending to live a whole new life. But then you\u2019re life changed forever when you spotted him across the farmer\u2019s market\u2026 You knew it was him\u2026 The long brown hair, muscular build, and the crystal blue eyes. As you were staring at him he looked up as if sensing that someone was watching him. When his eyes met yours, his eyes widened in surprise. You quickly turned away and continued shopping.<br/>As you continue shopping you know that he\u2019s following you. You stop at a fruit stand and look at the fruits in front of you. The woman at the stand speaks Romanian and you smile at her before responding. \u201cC\u00e2t de mult pentru mere?\u201d (<b>Yes. How much for the apples?</b>) \u201cDou\u0103.\u201d The woman responds. (<b>Two.</b>) You nod. \u201cBine, d\u0103-mi &hellip; opt.\u201d (<b>Alright, give me&hellip; eight.</b>) you say while getting out your wallet to purchase the apples. You give the woman the money and decide to head home. You look around for the soldier but don\u2019t see him anywhere.<br/>As you pass an alley near your apartment building a hand grabs your arm and pulls you into the alley. You try to scream but a gloved hand covers your mouth. \u201cDon\u2019t scream.\u201d a male voice says from behind you. You stiffen as you recognize the voice. \u201cI\u2019m not going to hurt you.\u201d the voice continues. You move your head against the gloved hand that\u2019s covering your mouth and he removes it. \u201cWhat the hell are you doing?\u201d you ask him. \u201cWhat do you mean \u2018What am I doing?\u2019 What are you doing? Are you following me?\u201d he asks you. \u201cNo! Why would I be following you?\u201d you ask. \u201cHYDRA.\u201d he simply answers. \u201cI haven\u2019t done anything to do with HYDRA since Washington D.C.\u201d you say as you get out of his grip. \u201cOh\u2026, sorry.\u201d he says softly. \u201cIt\u2019s alright.\u201d you say with a small smile. \u201cIt\u2019s always better to be safe than sorry.\u201d you continue which makes him nod in agreement.</p><ul><li>After that you and Bucky (As you learned from him as you got to know more about him) moved in together since both of you thought it would be safer if the authorities came for either of you there would be another person there to protect the other.</li><li>During the time the 2 of you had gotten to know each other the both of you started to develop feelings for one another.</li><li>Than the attack in Vienna happened\u2026 You knew it wasn\u2019t Bucky since he was in Bucharest with you, but you knew it was only a matter of time before someone found out where he was, and you swore on your life you would protect him no matter what.</li><li>At the UK Headquarters building (<b>I don\u2019t remember what the building was called since I haven\u2019t watched Civil War in forever&hellip;</b>) when Bucky went into Winter Soldier mode, you tried to make him snap out of it and for a moment you could\u2019ve sworn he almost broke out of it as you were fighting against him&hellip;</li><li>During the Civil War between the Avengers you stayed by Bucky\u2019s side and did your best to protect him. (<b>Especially from T\u2019Challa</b>)</li><li>After the whole ordeal with The Avengers and The Accords you went with Steve and Bucky to Wakanda since T\u2019Challa had offered to cure him.</li></ul><!-- more --><p>You stare at Bucky as he sits on the examination table. His metal arm gone as the result of the battle dealing with The Avengers and The Accords. Steve told you what had happened in Siberia and you can\u2019t help but feel bad for Tony Stark since he had just found out that both of his parents were murdered instead of being in a car crash like he had thought\u2026<br/>You feel eyes on you, which makes you look up at Bucky again to see him staring at you. You slowly walk up to him and smile softly at him as you take his hand in yours. \u201cAre you sure you want to do this?\u201d you ask softly. He nods. \u201cI can\u2019t trust my own mind (Y/N). All the stuff HYDRA put in me is still in there\u2026 It\u2019s for the best.\u201d he says softly as he gives your hand a squeeze. You smile softly at him before leaning forward and pressing a quick kiss on his cheek. You pull back to see him looking at you in shock and with bright red cheeks. You giggle slightly at his face before he grabs the back of your head bringing your face down to his, meeting your lips with his in a passionate kiss. You stand there in shock for a few seconds before your body relaxes and you kiss him back.<br/>He slowly pulls away a minute later so that you can catch your breath. He stares into your eyes and smiles softly before the doctors start examining him again.</p><ul><li>Then it came time for him to go under cyro.</li></ul><p>You restrained yourself from begging him to not do this but you knew it was for the best.<br/>You watched beside Steve as Bucky\u2019s eyes close and the glass is covered in a thin layer of ice, signaling that he was frozen. \u201cHe\u2019s going to be alright, (Y/N).\u201d Steve says making you turn to him. \u201cI know.\u201d you say with a small smile even though your heart is aching for him.</p><ul><li>You staying in Wakanda until Bucky wakes up.</li><li>You giving him a big ol\u2019 kiss when he wakes up from being in cyro.</li><li>You becoming best friends with Shuri since she lets you visit him when she\u2019s working with him.</li><li>You being relieved when he says that all of the things that HYDRA had put in his head is gone.</li><li>Him watching you sleep and thinking of how lucky he is to have you and you doing the same.</li><li>You comforting him whenever he has nightmares about when he was The Winter Soldier.</li></ul><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s alright Buck, they can&rsquo;t get to you here. Your safe now.&rdquo;</p><ul><li>Possessive Bucky.</li></ul><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re mine!&rdquo;</p><ul><li>Jealous Bucky.</li></ul><p>Whenever he sees another guy flirting with you, he tries to restrain himself from marching over to you and literally showing the guy that you belong to him, and him only. But he stays put since he knows that you can take care of yourself just fine. But as soon as he considers that the guy thinks he has his chances with you, he shows up next to you, placing his arm around your waist, kisses your cheek and says something like \u201cWho\u2019s this, doll?\u201d</p><ul><li>Both worshipping each other\u2019s bodies.</li></ul><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re so beautiful&hellip;&rdquo;</p><ul><li>Shirtless Bucky!!!! (<b>I couldn&rsquo;t find a good picture\ud83d\ude1f</b>)</li><li>Saying \u201cI love you\u2019s\u201d multiple times through the day</li><li>Always making the other smile</li><li>Rough sex.</li><li>Make up sex.</li><li>Gentle sex.</li><li>Taking pictures of him so you can look at them while he\u2019s away on a mission.</li><li>Him not wanting you to leave the bed in the morning.</li></ul><p>\u201cBut\u2026 doll.

You quickly turned away and continued shopping.<br>As you continue shopping you know that he\u2019s following you. You stop at a fruit stand and look at the fruits in front of you.

You giggle slightly at his face before he grabs the back of your head bringing your face down to his, meeting your lips with his in a passionate kiss. You stand there in shock for a few seconds before your body relaxes and you kiss him back.<br>He slowly pulls away a minute later so that you can catch your breath.

Incident happened you knew that he had recognized Steve from his life before he was the Winter Soldier.</li><li>After the fall of HYDRA and SHIELD you went into hiding, not intending to run into the ex-Winter Soldier.</li></ul><p>You moved to Bucharest intending to live a whole new life. But then you&rsquo;re life changed forever when you spotted him across the farmer&rsquo;s market&hellip; You knew it was him&hellip; The long brown hair, muscular build, and the crystal blue eyes. As you were staring at him he looked up as if sensing that someone was watching him. When his eyes met yours, his eyes widened in surprise. You quickly turned away and continued shopping.<br />As you continue shopping you know that he&rsquo;s following you. You stop at a fruit stand and look at the fruits in front of you. The woman at the stand speaks Romanian and you smile at her before responding. &ldquo;C&acirc;t de mult pentru mere?&rdquo; (<b>Yes. How much for the apples?</b>) &ldquo;Dou&#259;.&rdquo; The woman responds. (<b>Two.</b>) You nod. &ldquo;Bine, d&#259;-mi &hellip; opt.&rdquo; (<b>Alright, give me&hellip; eight.</b>) you say while getting out your wallet to purchase the apples. You give the woman the money and decide to head home. You look around for the soldier but don&rsquo;t see him anywhere.<br />As you pass an alley near your apartment building a hand grabs your arm and pulls you into the alley. You try to scream but a gloved hand covers your mouth. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t scream.&rdquo; a male voice says from behind you. You stiffen as you recognize the voice. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to hurt you.&rdquo; the voice continues. You move your head against the gloved hand that&rsquo;s covering your mouth and he removes it. &ldquo;What the hell are you doing?&rdquo; you ask him. &ldquo;What do you mean &lsquo;What am I doing?&rsquo; What are you doing? Are you following me?&rdquo; he asks you. &ldquo;No! Why would I be following you?&rdquo; you ask. &ldquo;HYDRA.&rdquo; he simply answers. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t done anything to do with HYDRA since Washington D.C.&rdquo; you say as you get out of his grip. &ldquo;Oh&hellip;, sorry.&rdquo; he says softly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s alright.&rdquo; you say with a small smile. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s always better to be safe than sorry.&rdquo; you continue which makes him nod in agreement.</p><ul><li>After that you and Bucky (As you learned from him as you got to know more about him) moved in together since both of you thought it would be safer if the authorities came for either of you there would be another person there to protect the other.</li><li>During the time the 2 of you had gotten to know each other the both of you started to develop feelings for one another.</li><li>Than the attack in Vienna happened&hellip; You knew it wasn&rsquo;t Bucky since he was in Bucharest with you, but you knew it was only a matter of time before someone found out where he was, and you swore on your life you would protect him no matter what.</li><li>At the UK Headquarters building (<b>I don&rsquo;t remember what the building was called since I haven&rsquo;t watched Civil War in forever&hellip;</b>) when Bucky went into Winter Soldier mode, you tried to make him snap out of it and for a moment you could&rsquo;ve sworn he almost broke out of it as you were fighting against him&hellip;</li><li>During the Civil War between the Avengers you stayed by Bucky&rsquo;s side and did your best to protect him. (<b>Especially from T&rsquo;Challa</b>)</li><li>After the whole ordeal with The Avengers and The Accords you went with Steve and Bucky to Wakanda since T&rsquo;Challa had offered to cure him.</li></ul><p>You stare at Bucky as he sits on the examination table. His metal arm gone as the result of the battle dealing with The Avengers and The Accords. Steve told you what had happened in Siberia and you can&rsquo;t help but feel bad for Tony Stark since he had just found out that both of his parents were murdered instead of being in a car crash like he had thought&hellip;<br />You feel eyes on you, which makes you look up at Bucky again to see him staring at you. You slowly walk up to him and smile softly at him as you take his hand in yours. &ldquo;Are you sure you want to do this?&rdquo; you ask softly. He nods. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t trust my own mind (Y/N). All the stuff HYDRA put in me is still in there&hellip; It&rsquo;s for the best.&rdquo; he says softly as he gives your hand a squeeze. You smile softly at him before leaning forward and pressing a quick kiss on his cheek. You pull back to see him looking at you in shock and with bright red cheeks. You giggle slightly at his face before he grabs the back of your head bringing your face down to his, meeting your lips with his in a passionate kiss. You stand there in shock for a few seconds before your body relaxes and you kiss him back.<br />He slowly pulls away a minute later so that you can catch your breath. He stares into your eyes and smiles softly before the doctors start examining him again.</p><ul><li>Then it came time for him to go under cyro.</li></ul><p>You restrained yourself from begging him to not do this but you knew it was for the best.<br />You watched beside Steve as Bucky&rsquo;s eyes close and the glass is covered in a thin layer of ice, signaling that he was frozen. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s going to be alright, (Y/N).&rdquo; Steve says making you turn to him. &ldquo;I know.&rdquo; you say with a small smile even though your heart is aching for him.</p><ul><li>You staying in Wakanda until Bucky wakes up.</li><li>You giving him a big ol&rsquo; kiss when he wakes up from being in cyro.</li><li>You becoming best friends with Shuri since she lets you visit him when she&rsquo;s working with him.</li><li>You being relieved when he says that all of the things that HYDRA had put in his head is gone.</li><li>Him watching you sleep and thinking of how lucky he is to have you and you doing the same.</li><li>You comforting him whenever he has nightmares about when he was The Winter Soldier.</li></ul><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s alright Buck, they can&rsquo;t get to you here.

But he stays put since he knows that you can take care of yourself just fine. But as soon as he considers that the guy thinks he has his chances with you, he shows up next to you, placing his arm around your waist, kisses your cheek and says something like &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s this, doll?&rdquo;</p><ul><li>Both worshipping each other&rsquo;s bodies.</li></ul><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re so beautiful&hellip;&rdquo;</p><ul><li>Shirtless Bucky!!!!

You smiled as you walked up to the door opening it to see Bucky who was holding a single rose in his hand. His jaw literally dropped to the floor at the sight of you in the dress. &ldquo;Close your mouth before you catch flies, Barnes.&rdquo; you say with a smirk. Your comment made him laugh, a blush appearing on his cheeks. Then was your turn to admire him. He really does clean up good.<br />He took you out dancing at an old club in Brooklyn, and the 2 of you danced the whole night away. You had never had so much fun in your life.</p></p>",

I just searched for a Picture and a Gif of Bucky Barnes and ^^ are the ones I chose to use!!!!!!</b>)<br /></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The 2 of you met when he was the Winter Soldier and you were a HYDRA agent, and you were assigned to help him assassinate Nick Fury.</li>\n<li>When the Washington D.C. Incident happened you knew that he had recognized Steve from his life before he was the Winter Soldier.</li>\n<li>After the fall of HYDRA and SHIELD you went into hiding, not intending to run into the ex-Winter Soldier.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You moved to Bucharest intending to live a whole new life. But then you&rsquo;re life changed forever when you spotted him across the farmer&rsquo;s market&hellip; You knew it was him&hellip; The long brown hair, muscular build, and the crystal blue eyes. As you were staring at him he looked up as if sensing that someone was watching him. When his eyes met yours, his eyes widened in surprise. You quickly turned away and continued shopping.<br />As you continue shopping you know that he&rsquo;s following you. You stop at a fruit stand and look at the fruits in front of you. The woman at the stand speaks Romanian and you smile at her before responding. &ldquo;C&acirc;t de mult pentru mere?&rdquo; (<b>Yes. How much for the apples?</b>) &ldquo;Dou&#259;.&rdquo; The woman responds. (<b>Two.</b>) You nod. &ldquo;Bine, d&#259;-mi &hellip; opt.&rdquo; (<b>Alright, give me&hellip; eight.</b>) you say while getting out your wallet to purchase the apples. You give the woman the money and decide to head home. You look around for the soldier but don&rsquo;t see him anywhere.<br />As you pass an alley near your apartment building a hand grabs your arm and pulls you into the alley. You try to scream but a gloved hand covers your mouth. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t scream.&rdquo; a male voice says from behind you. You stiffen as you recognize the voice. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to hurt you.&rdquo; the voice continues. You move your head against the gloved hand that&rsquo;s covering your mouth and he removes it. &ldquo;What the hell are you doing?&rdquo; you ask him. &ldquo;What do you mean &lsquo;What am I doing?&rsquo; What are you doing? Are you following me?&rdquo; he asks you. &ldquo;No! Why would I be following you?&rdquo; you ask. &ldquo;HYDRA.&rdquo; he simply answers. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t done anything to do with HYDRA since Washington D.C.&rdquo; you say as you get out of his grip. &ldquo;Oh&hellip;, sorry.&rdquo; he says softly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s alright.&rdquo; you say with a small smile. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s always better to be safe than sorry.&rdquo; you continue which makes him nod in agreement.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>After that you and Bucky (As you learned from him as you got to know more about him) moved in together since both of you thought it would be safer if the authorities came for either of you there would be another person there to protect the other.</li>\n<li>During the time the 2 of you had gotten to know each other the both of you started to develop feelings for one another.</li>\n<li>Than the attack in Vienna happened&hellip; You knew it wasn&rsquo;t Bucky since he was in Bucharest with you, but you knew it was only a matter of time before someone found out where he was, and you swore on your life you would protect him no matter what.</li>\n<li>At the UK Headquarters building (<b>I don&rsquo;t remember what the building was called since I haven&rsquo;t watched Civil War in forever&hellip;</b>) when Bucky went into Winter Soldier mode, you tried to make him snap out of it and for a moment you could&rsquo;ve sworn he almost broke out of it as you were fighting against him&hellip;</li>\n<li>During the Civil War between the Avengers you stayed by Bucky&rsquo;s side and did your best to protect him.
