When Too-Ticky tells Moomin to watch out for other lost souls, at first I thought it was going to be a touching but generalized message to the viewers to look for invisible children in their own life (very good) but THEN&ndash; after Moomin thinks for a sec he seems to realize something, and then as the music starts the camera pans over to where Snufkin is walking away.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1068\" data-orig-height=\"607\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/0aa5924ad9a0d551fbbbf12f66abc3be/tumblr_inline_pqctuo1x7l1rwq03c_1280.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1068\" data-orig-height=\"607\"/></figure><p>stuff like that in animation is rarely coincidence and usually super planned out, so it\u2019s not a far leap to think the song also relates to Moomin and Snufkin!!!</p><p>Before I get into lyrics I wanna point out a few things about Moomin. Bless that guy. So I\u2019m obviously not 100% on what Moominvalley canon is as far as how long he and Snufkin have known each other &amp; what adventures they\u2019ve already gone on before the first ep, but it\u2019s clear that they\u2019re already good enough friends that Moomin knows how to respect his space, even in Snufkin\u2019s mind/memory.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1089\" data-orig-height=\"701\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/04be21e241b4d6f96d67282e6daf31da/tumblr_inline_pqcx1imW6w1rwq03c_1280.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1089\" data-orig-height=\"701\"/></figure><p>And he is able to guide others in doing the same\u00a0(like when he stops Sniff from continuing to bug Snufkin after Snufkin has reached his limit)</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1083\" data-orig-height=\"609\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/6717398aa4d5e7a8ef972cb92ef96655/tumblr_inline_pqctr7MzSK1rwq03c_1280.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1083\" data-orig-height=\"609\"/></figure><p>I think this experience helped him tremendously when it came to Ninny! Out of everyone there (besides Moominmama, where he must have learned his patience from) he is able to intuit her needs the best of everyone and is most effective in making her feel welcome! (probably from having dealt with Snufkin so much, or maybe its just in his nature) It works well until he gets ahead of himself and starts talking over her/thinks he knows what she needs without listening to her. This fails, and he quickly realizes what he did wrong and makes amends and is the first to realize how important it is to LISTEN! and then he explains that to the others.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1033\" data-orig-height=\"599\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/13e95896db4df328496004219ca7e1c2/tumblr_inline_pqcu03ynDv1rwq03c_1280.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1033\" data-orig-height=\"599\"/></figure><p>Moomin\u2019s ability to understand and be friends with uhhhh basically everyone he meets is nothing to sneeze at AND is pretty unique to his character when you think about it. More than anyone else (excluding Moominmama cuz she\u2019s God Tier) he shows again and again &ndash;even when it may take some time&ndash; that he has the patience to get to know someone and find value in them, no matter how different they are from him or how annoying they are to other characters. We see this in Sniff, the ghost, the ancestor, Little My, Ninny, (a hint of it with the groke), Snorkmaiden, Moominpapa, Too-Ticky, etc. etc. (and way more in the books but I\u2019m just talking about Moominvalley for now) and of course our dear Nuuskamuikkunen.</p><p>Basically Moomin is really good at at least giving empathy a shot, something not every character can do (moominpappa, little my, and sniff can be kinda bad at it). That kind of caring can be life changing to someone who hasn\u2019t really had much understanding before!\u00a0</p><p>Which brings us back to Snufkin, who\u2019s privacy/introversion isn\u2019t often respected/understood.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1098\" data-orig-height=\"677\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e42c6bab86843e17a0d46e2e471c02eb/tumblr_inline_pqcuelJ6VE1rwq03c_1280.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1098\" data-orig-height=\"677\"/></figure><p>To the point where (even though he DOES like people!!!) he often gets overwhelmed and can\u2019t see any way out besides to just- leave. Like he left Moomin at the party, like he left moomin &amp; sniff at his own campfire with an abrupt\u00a0\u201csleep well\u201d, &amp; how he leaves every winter.\u00a0<br/></p><figure data-orig-width=\"1075\" data-orig-height=\"611\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d852b6c2190108893a2e2a714802ea8f/tumblr_inline_pqcuo5P1iA1rwq03c_1280.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1075\" data-orig-height=\"611\"/></figure><p>And why does Snufkin act like that? I really hope Moominvalley dives into it!! *rubs hands together* Besides it just being his Nature or whatever, in the books it says that he was found abandoned in a box (if memory serves) and basically grew up totally on his own as a wanderer and never had a home of his own and DEFINITELY never had anyone he could rely on besides himself. When you grow up that unstable, its no wonder you might want to take the stability into your own hands anyway you can. Why form strong attachments if they\u2019re not going to last, or if it means you have to give up an integral part of yourself/your freedom/the only thing you\u2019ve been able to control? This is just speculation though (I\u2019m still reading the books too and I\u2019m curious if the show will even address his past much at all!)</p><p>Anyway, considering how often he\u2019s misunderstood even in super friendly Moominvalley who knows what he experienced elsewhere. It\u2019s easier to retreat inward and fall back on to relying on yourself and no one else. The fact he views strong connections to people as something that can cage you/prevent you from being free, reveals a lot about the relationships/lack of relationships he\u2019s probably known.<br/><br/>however. we keep seeing hints that Snufkin isn\u2019t always.. totally okay with this. we see that sometimes Snufkin needs company too.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"597\" data-orig-height=\"637\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/1cdc4d300ccf635918fe326d6cacd32c/tumblr_inline_pqcv53F1db1rwq03c_1280.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"597\" data-orig-height=\"637\"/></figure><p>(It\u2019s also worth noting that when Snufkin realizes he feels lonely he assumes he must be sick or something because it feels so at odds with his identity. THE BABY DOESN\u2019T KNOW HOW TO DEAL.)<br/></p><p>He really has no idea how to grapple with the concept of Sometimes Needing People. He doesn\u2019t know how to admit it to himself let alone others. In general despite spouting a lot of generic wise hot-topic-like phrases of advice (hehe i love them), when it comes to explaining himself to others (ESPECIALLY MOOMIN) he has NO idea what to do. which is seen in him stuttering and being evasive and hurrying away whenever questioned LOL.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1056\" data-orig-height=\"699\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/a3d36f6592c0f7891ae35e4a3f59666d/tumblr_inline_pqcubuIfWX1rwq03c_1280.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1056\" data-orig-height=\"699\"/></figure><p>Even when he does think he understands himself and is happy with his own solitude, he gets kinda knocked down a peg with both Titi-uu and Little My/the woodies.

When Too-Ticky tells Moomin to watch out for other lost souls, at first I thought it was going to be a touching but generalized message to the viewers to look for invisible children in their own life (very good) but THEN\u2013 after Moomin thinks for a sec he seems to realize something, and then as the music starts the camera pans over to where Snufkin is walking away.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1068\" data-orig-height=\"607\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/0aa5924ad9a0d551fbbbf12f66abc3be/tumblr_inline_pqctuo1x7l1rwq03c_1280.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1068\" data-orig-height=\"607\"></figure><p>stuff like that in animation is rarely coincidence and usually super planned out, so it\u2019s not a far leap to think the song also relates to Moomin and Snufkin!!!</p><p>Before I get into lyrics I wanna point out a few things about Moomin. Bless that guy. So I\u2019m obviously not 100% on what Moominvalley canon is as far as how long he and Snufkin have known each other &amp; what adventures they\u2019ve already gone on before the first ep, but it\u2019s clear that they\u2019re already good enough friends that Moomin knows how to respect his space, even in Snufkin\u2019s mind/memory.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1089\" data-orig-height=\"701\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/04be21e241b4d6f96d67282e6daf31da/tumblr_inline_pqcx1imW6w1rwq03c_1280.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1089\" data-orig-height=\"701\"></figure><p>And he is able to guide others in doing the same\u00a0(like when he stops Sniff from continuing to bug Snufkin after Snufkin has reached his limit)</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1083\" data-orig-height=\"609\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/6717398aa4d5e7a8ef972cb92ef96655/tumblr_inline_pqctr7MzSK1rwq03c_1280.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1083\" data-orig-height=\"609\"></figure><p>I think this experience helped him tremendously when it came to Ninny! Out of everyone there (besides Moominmama, where he must have learned his patience from) he is able to intuit her needs the best of everyone and is most effective in making her feel welcome! (probably from having dealt with Snufkin so much, or maybe its just in his nature) It works well until he gets ahead of himself and starts talking over her/thinks he knows what she needs without listening to her. This fails, and he quickly realizes what he did wrong and makes amends and is the first to realize how important it is to LISTEN! and then he explains that to the others.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1033\" data-orig-height=\"599\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/13e95896db4df328496004219ca7e1c2/tumblr_inline_pqcu03ynDv1rwq03c_1280.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1033\" data-orig-height=\"599\"></figure><p>Moomin\u2019s ability to understand and be friends with uhhhh basically everyone he meets is nothing to sneeze at AND is pretty unique to his character when you think about it. More than anyone else (excluding Moominmama cuz she\u2019s God Tier) he shows again and again \u2013even when it may take some time\u2013 that he has the patience to get to know someone and find value in them, no matter how different they are from him or how annoying they are to other characters. We see this in Sniff, the ghost, the ancestor, Little My, Ninny, (a hint of it with the groke), Snorkmaiden, Moominpapa, Too-Ticky, etc. etc. (and way more in the books but I\u2019m just talking about Moominvalley for now) and of course our dear Nuuskamuikkunen.</p><p>Basically Moomin is really good at at least giving empathy a shot, something not every character can do (moominpappa, little my, and sniff can be kinda bad at it). That kind of caring can be life changing to someone who hasn\u2019t really had much understanding before!\u00a0</p><p>Which brings us back to Snufkin, who\u2019s privacy/introversion isn\u2019t often respected/understood.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1098\" data-orig-height=\"677\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e42c6bab86843e17a0d46e2e471c02eb/tumblr_inline_pqcuelJ6VE1rwq03c_1280.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1098\" data-orig-height=\"677\"></figure><p>To the point where (even though he DOES like people!!!) he often gets overwhelmed and can\u2019t see any way out besides to just- leave. Like he left Moomin at the party, like he left moomin &amp; sniff at his own campfire with an abrupt\u00a0\u201csleep well\u201d, &amp; how he leaves every winter.\u00a0<br></p><figure data-orig-width=\"1075\" data-orig-height=\"611\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d852b6c2190108893a2e2a714802ea8f/tumblr_inline_pqcuo5P1iA1rwq03c_1280.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1075\" data-orig-height=\"611\"></figure><p>And why does Snufkin act like that? I really hope Moominvalley dives into it!! *rubs hands together* Besides it just being his Nature or whatever, in the books it says that he was found abandoned in a box (if memory serves) and basically grew up totally on his own as a wanderer and never had a home of his own and DEFINITELY never had anyone he could rely on besides himself. When you grow up that unstable, its no wonder you might want to take the stability into your own hands anyway you can. Why form strong attachments if they\u2019re not going to last, or if it means you have to give up an integral part of yourself/your freedom/the only thing you\u2019ve been able to control? This is just speculation though (I\u2019m still reading the books too and I\u2019m curious if the show will even address his past much at all!)</p><p>Anyway, considering how often he\u2019s misunderstood even in super friendly Moominvalley who knows what he experienced elsewhere. It\u2019s easier to retreat inward and fall back on to relying on yourself and no one else. The fact he views strong connections to people as something that can cage you/prevent you from being free, reveals a lot about the relationships/lack of relationships he\u2019s probably known.<br><br>however. we keep seeing hints that Snufkin isn\u2019t always.. totally okay with this. we see that sometimes Snufkin needs company too.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"597\" data-orig-height=\"637\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/1cdc4d300ccf635918fe326d6cacd32c/tumblr_inline_pqcv53F1db1rwq03c_1280.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"597\" data-orig-height=\"637\"></figure><p>(It\u2019s also worth noting that when Snufkin realizes he feels lonely he assumes he must be sick or something because it feels so at odds with his identity. THE BABY DOESN\u2019T KNOW HOW TO DEAL.)<br></p><p>He really has no idea how to grapple with the concept of Sometimes Needing People. He doesn\u2019t know how to admit it to himself let alone others. In general despite spouting a lot of generic wise hot-topic-like phrases of advice (hehe i love them), when it comes to explaining himself to others (ESPECIALLY MOOMIN) he has NO idea what to do. which is seen in him stuttering and being evasive and hurrying away whenever questioned LOL.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1056\" data-orig-height=\"699\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/a3d36f6592c0f7891ae35e4a3f59666d/tumblr_inline_pqcubuIfWX1rwq03c_1280.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1056\" data-orig-height=\"699\"></figure><p>Even when he does think he understands himself and is happy with his own solitude, he gets kinda knocked down a peg with both Titi-uu and Little My/the woodies.

We see this in Sniff, the ghost, the ancestor, Little My, Ninny, (a hint of it with the groke), Snorkmaiden, Moominpapa, Too-Ticky, etc. etc. (and way more in the books but I\u2019m just talking about Moominvalley for now) and of course our dear Nuuskamuikkunen.</p><p>Basically Moomin is really good at at least giving empathy a shot, something not every character can do (moominpappa, little my, and sniff can be kinda bad at it).

Moom doesn&rsquo;t want to force him into a lifestyle or role that Snuf doesn&rsquo;t want to fulfill, he just wants to be with Snufkin in whatever way works, even if its unconventional.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/14eace39ea31f8d902b26a22c88ca540/tumblr_inline_pqcxniHNpH1rwq03c_1280.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>&ldquo;You said &ldquo;I will listen, tell me it all<br />You don&rsquo;t like the ending?<br /><b>Then we&rsquo;ll find one that&rsquo;s yours.</b>&rdquo;</p><p>To have someone who&rsquo;s willing to work with him like this, big or small&ndash; This is probably new to Snufkin!!! Or at least, maybe Moomin has always tried to put that out there, but it&rsquo;s taken a while for Snufkin to finally start to believe/understand/trust that? He used to think building a strong relationship would mean sacrificing a part of himself, but maybe learn to see that he wouldn&rsquo;t have to? He&rsquo;s growing! and its a good grow!</p><p>&ldquo;Something new, something strange<br />Ten feet taller, I had changed<br />I believe you, I&rsquo;m not wrong<br />Oh, it suits me to feel strong&ldquo;</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/3316321fec4baf6c8601b551fd4ebe61/tumblr_inline_pqcyfbVBl81rwq03c_1280.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>There&rsquo;s that little bit of euphoria where he realizes.. caring about someone deeply can be a really good and positive thing.</p><p>And finally&hellip; remember how all of Snufkin&rsquo;s life and identity revolves around wanting to be free? And how at first he thought being free meant to have no strong attachments? But maybe&hellip; just maybe&hellip; after working in loving tandem with Moomin&hellip;.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, how did you know?<br />That&rsquo;s all we need?<br />A promise of hope<br /><b>Is enough</b> to feel free.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>:&rsquo;) the end</p><p>the potential is all carefully set up and there, I&rsquo;m so excited to see what Moominvalley does with it! Especially since Moomin&rsquo;s storyline seems to be revolving around him becoming more independent and finding his own, while Snufkin&rsquo;s is about learning it&rsquo;s okay to need others. They meet in the middle.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/1824691606207364d2e096752ee87533/tumblr_inline_pqdk0qpJZd1rwq03c_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>But things are never quite that easy in Moominvalley, so who knows how lost we&rsquo;ll see snufkin before he gets&nbsp;&ldquo;found&rdquo;&hellip;? or vise versa.
