I tried to state my point. But go to the end and see what i mean overall.)</p><p>OK, so I hear that there people calling Ironstrange as a \u201chate\u201d ship. Now I see this as a very stupid way to call out a ship. I mean yes, there are people who dislike Steve because of what had happened to Tony. And believe me, I feel the same. I disliked how it seemed that Steve cared more about Bucky than the others, especially about Bucky killing Tony\u2019s parents. Even though, he considers Howard his friend, so wouldn\u2019t it be logical to tell your friend\u2019s son about his death. However, I do not \u201chate\u201d Steve in a way other fan would see, I just hate the way he handled the situation. But that doesn\u2019t mean I hate him as a whole, just how he handle his actions, and what could have been done to avoid the Civil war in the first place. I\u2019ll talk about that another time, back to the topic. </p><p>So, antis calling ironstrange a \u201chate\u201d ship. Ok, if you apply that logic about \u201cshippers hating on Steve\u201d, wouldn\u2019t the rest of the ships that include Tony being with someone else besides Steve, a \u201chate\u201d ship. Because, believe me, there are many more people who put the tag ,\u201dNot Steve friendly\u201d or \u201cNot Team Cap friendly\u201d on other ships, way before Ironstrange became popular. There were many who wrote Tchalla x Tony, iron boyfriends, Quill x Tony, Science boyfriends, Frostiron, and Pepperony fics that were \u201cNot Steve friendly\u201d because they were bitter on Steve\u2019s actions. Especially, the Winteriron ship who wanted both Bucky and Tony to heal together and put the tag \u201cNot Steve friendly\u201d due to bitterness of what had happened due to Civil war and before that. Some don\u2019t even put shipping into their \u201cNot Steve friendly\u201d Fics and they were just as bitter as the shippers were at that time, during Civil War. Also, there are others who do crossover ship, like Batman x Tony, who also wrote \u201cNot Steve friendly\u201d fics. </p><p>So, if you antis are calling Ironstrange a hate ship because of what happened with Steve, then you\u2019ll be calling out on all the ships that doesn\u2019t even ship ironstrange out because of had happened in civil war. Hey Antis, if that is what is going on then congratulations, you are an official Ship hater. Antis who are mad at shippers thinking at specific ship are made to hate on Steve, now hate Pepperony, Science boyfriends, Iron boyfriends, Winteriron, Frostiron, Thor x Tony, Tchalla x Tony, Quill x Tony, and many other pairings that have people being shipped with Tony.If you can hint at the level of bitter sarcasm at what I just called the antis, thank you for noticing. And to be honest, people shipping Tony with anyone else but Steve aren\u2019t the only one who dont appreciate Steve\u2019s actions towards Civil War. In fact some people who ship Steve with anyone thinks that due to Steve\u2019s actions of mainly focusing on Bucky and his past think that Steve is getting a little unhealthy on how he handles things, that\u2019s why some don\u2019t appreciate the ship Stucky. Anyways, now let\u2019s talk about the general ship that is being called a hate ship. </p><p>Seriously, I know that they didnt have that much interaction within Infinity war, but haven\u2019t you read the comics. They have interacted on many occasions during the comics, helping each other out. Where do you think they got the name, \u201cFacial hair bros\u201d or \u201cFacial hair husbands\u201d for some. They got those names in the comics based on their interactions. and they seem to work very well with each other, even though due to their personality it could irritate each other some times. So, what makes it a hate ship? Is it because that you think Steve should be paired with Tony? Due you hate Tony? Do you hate Stephen? Well, if we are basing this on the MCU verse Stony, after Civil War and before, the two seem to have some shifty unbalance with each other due to different perspectives of how things should go. Especially, since the Accords. For some who dislike to ship Tony with Steve or do not appear to like Steve any more, they see Steve as someone fighting for an alternative motive, not just fighting against Tony because of the Accords. It\u2019s what the government may to do to Bucky. His old friend who he sees as person from his past that he can still hold on to. Come on, Sharon literally told Steve what may happen to Bucky if he was caught by Tchalla and Tony, which he opposed. And some see that as very unhealthy behavior if they were to pair Tony with Steve because they\u2019d think Steve is only going to use him again. Even some shippers think that way of Stucky because they think that Steve is making Bucky\u2019s decisions, as stated on the previous paragraph. </p><p>Now yes, me talking and explaining everything about this ship hate has already made this rant a little bit confusing but, what I\u2019m basically saying is. Ironstramge is not a hate ship, you antis. It\u2019s a different ship, that these fans consider healthy due to similar personalities with the characters and similar past that helped redeem themselves from who they once were. And they think that if they were shipped together, it\u2019s compatible. There are people out there who dislike Steve due to Civil war, and they aren\u2019t just Ironstrange shippers. So don\u2019t start calling out on Ironstrange shipper, just because you think that they just want to release the anger that have on Steve. <b>Because, there are others out there who do ship ironstrange, Understand that the hate on Steve has to stop. They have post out there that have Stucky and Ironstrange together as a family helping raise Peter. Some post are out there having all four of them into an OT4. And others just want Steve to be a supportive to Ironstrange, whether or not Steve has Bucky.</b></p><p><b>Anyways, at the end of the day. Most people just want the hate on Steve, Tony, or Any characters and ships to end. No one wants to see wars and hate, we just came to this community to have fun and enjoy fan art, fan fiction, and other contributions to the fandom that we all enjoy. So stop the hate already! </b>Anyways, see ya for the next thing I may post.</p>",

Because, believe me, there are many more people who put the tag ,&rdquo;Not Steve friendly&rdquo; or &ldquo;Not Team Cap friendly&rdquo; on other ships, way before Ironstrange became popular. There were many who wrote Tchalla x Tony, iron boyfriends, Quill x Tony, Science boyfriends, Frostiron, and Pepperony fics that were &ldquo;Not Steve friendly&rdquo; because they were bitter on Steve&rsquo;s actions. Especially, the Winteriron ship who wanted both Bucky and Tony to heal together and put the tag &ldquo;Not Steve friendly&rdquo; due to bitterness of what had happened due to Civil war and before that. Some don&rsquo;t even put shipping into their &ldquo;Not Steve friendly&rdquo; Fics and they were just as bitter as the shippers were at that time, during Civil War. Also, there are others who do crossover ship, like Batman x Tony, who also wrote &ldquo;Not Steve friendly&rdquo; fics. </p><p>So, if you antis are calling Ironstrange a hate ship because of what happened with Steve, then you&rsquo;ll be calling out on all the ships that doesn&rsquo;t even ship ironstrange out because of had happened in civil war. Hey Antis, if that is what is going on then congratulations, you are an official Ship hater. Antis who are mad at shippers thinking at specific ship are made to hate on Steve, now hate Pepperony, Science boyfriends, Iron boyfriends, Winteriron, Frostiron, Thor x Tony, Tchalla x Tony, Quill x Tony, and many other pairings that have people being shipped with Tony.If you can hint at the level of bitter sarcasm at what I just called the antis, thank you for noticing. And to be honest, people shipping Tony with anyone else but Steve aren&rsquo;t the only one who dont appreciate Steve&rsquo;s actions towards Civil War. In fact some people who ship Steve with anyone thinks that due to Steve&rsquo;s actions of mainly focusing on Bucky and his past think that Steve is getting a little unhealthy on how he handles things, that&rsquo;s why some don&rsquo;t appreciate the ship Stucky. Anyways, now let&rsquo;s talk about the general ship that is being called a hate ship. </p><p>Seriously, I know that they didnt have that much interaction within Infinity war, but haven&rsquo;t you read the comics. They have interacted on many occasions during the comics, helping each other out. Where do you think they got the name, &ldquo;Facial hair bros&rdquo; or &ldquo;Facial hair husbands&rdquo; for some. They got those names in the comics based on their interactions. and they seem to work very well with each other, even though due to their personality it could irritate each other some times. So, what makes it a hate ship? Is it because that you think Steve should be paired with Tony? Due you hate Tony? Do you hate Stephen? Well, if we are basing this on the MCU verse Stony, after Civil War and before, the two seem to have some shifty unbalance with each other due to different perspectives of how things should go. Especially, since the Accords. For some who dislike to ship Tony with Steve or do not appear to like Steve any more, they see Steve as someone fighting for an alternative motive, not just fighting against Tony because of the Accords. It&rsquo;s what the government may to do to Bucky. His old friend who he sees as person from his past that he can still hold on to. Come on, Sharon literally told Steve what may happen to Bucky if he was caught by Tchalla and Tony, which he opposed. And some see that as very unhealthy behavior if they were to pair Tony with Steve because they&rsquo;d think Steve is only going to use him again. Even some shippers think that way of Stucky because they think that Steve is making Bucky&rsquo;s decisions, as stated on the previous paragraph. </p><p>Now yes, me talking and explaining everything about this ship hate has already made this rant a little bit confusing but, what I&rsquo;m basically saying is. Ironstramge is not a hate ship, you antis. It&rsquo;s a different ship, that these fans consider healthy due to similar personalities with the characters and similar past that helped redeem themselves from who they once were. And they think that if they were shipped together, it&rsquo;s compatible. There are people out there who dislike Steve due to Civil war, and they aren&rsquo;t just Ironstrange shippers. So don&rsquo;t start calling out on Ironstrange shipper, just because you think that they just want to release the anger that have on Steve. <b>Because, there are others out there who do ship ironstrange, Understand that the hate on Steve has to stop. They have post out there that have Stucky and Ironstrange together as a family helping raise Peter. Some post are out there having all four of them into an OT4. And others just want Steve to be a supportive to Ironstrange, whether or not Steve has Bucky.</b></p><p><b>Anyways, at the end of the day. Most people just want the hate on Steve, Tony, or Any characters and ships to end. No one wants to see wars and hate, we just came to this community to have fun and enjoy fan art, fan fiction, and other contributions to the fandom that we all enjoy. So stop the hate already! </b>Anyways, see ya for the next thing I may post.</p></p>",

It was like your second home. You felt you could be yourself and embrace the <i>true you</i> there. It all started when you were young.

No I\u2019m not jealous, I don\u2019t know where you got <b>that </b>idea. Look sweetheart, I\u2019ve never been jealous, you know who has? Rhodey, when I drank the last of the whiskey, he was jealous. I Tony Stark have never been jealous.\u201d</p><p>You bit your lip and nodded,\u00a0\u201cRight, you know thats what people say when they are jealous.\u201d</p><p>Tony heaved a big sigh and walked like a lost puppy to you. He wrapped his arms around your torso and gave you a kiss on your forehead.\u00a0\u201c&hellip;fine I may be a tiny bit jealous.\u201d</p><p>You smiled, feeling, unknown to you, happy that he felt that way.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI just don\u2019t want no one taking my baby away from me,\u201d Tony admitted.\u00a0</p><p>You hugged Tony back and kissed his lips lightly,\u00a0\u201cNo one would ever be able to do that. I love you too much, you are my one and only.\u201d You kiss him again but this time longer and more passionately.\u00a0</p><hr><p>The musical you were in was Hamilton. You grew in love with the cast and the music, literally everything. You were playing Eliza who was Alexander Hamilton\u2019s wife.\u00a0</p><p>Tony, who sang each and every song with you when you both were home, sang the songs whilst sitting in his seat watching you. You already sang\u00a0\u201cHelpless\u201d, and the kiss that Tony was so worried about was when Eliza and Alexander are at their wedding and they share a kiss.\u00a0</p><p>The kiss was to symbolize the love they have for each other.\u00a0</p><p>The wedding scene was about to start and you knew you had to make this kiss seem real.\u00a0</p><p>You went to the guy playing Hamilton and with your veil and bouquet of flowers with you, you slowly, lovingly, kissed the actor.\u00a0</p><p>You made sure the kiss was passionate but not too much. After the kiss happened everyone clapped at your performance. You looked all around at the audience until you spotted a familiar face. Tony\u2019s. But he didn\u2019t seem happy or glad. He was clapping but his face looked depressed. Worried, you knitted your eyebrows together. Was he really that hurt by the kiss?</p><hr><p>The musical was over and everyone loved it. They were amazed by all the actors, including your performance.\u00a0</p><p>You sprinted outside in search for Tony. Who was waiting patiently for you in the car.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSo babe,\u201d you said while getting in.\u00a0\u201cWhat\u2019d you think?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cOh yeah you did great,\u201d he gave you a thumbs up,\u00a0\u201cit was perfect.\u201d He turned away from you looking out the window.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cTony?\u201d You lightly touched his shoulder.

Tony its like your shutting me out, you\u2019re distant. Why? If its because that kiss I\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t think it would affect you that much. I promise I won\u2019t do any more of those.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIts not <b>just </b>about the kiss.\u201d<br/></p><p>You shook your head,\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m not following.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I saw you kissing that guy, and the wedding music, it was all, it seemed real. I felt, like maybe you wouldn\u2019t want that with me cause of who I am. I feel like I might not ever give that to you. I\u2019m that guy who fought all those scary aliens, that guy that gets panic attacks and nightmares because of that day. I\u2019m damaged y/n, and sometimes I think I might not be able to give you that amazing life. So to answer your question earlier, yes, I am madly jealous of that guy. That he got to kiss somebody so incredible, somebody that deserves everything.\u201d<br/></p><p>You knew Tony was overwhelmed and you would never wish that on him. You brought him into a hug, comforting him with your soothing voice.\u00a0\u201cBaby, I don\u2019t want anyone else. I don\u2019t care if you\u2019re damaged, I want to help you with that. I want to be the one to take care of you when you do have your panic attacks, your nightmares, those moments. I want to be with you through the good, bad, through everything. I love you Tony more than anything in the world,\u201d you lace your fingers with his and kiss his hands.\u00a0</p><p>Tony places his forehead against yours and kisses you passionately.\u00a0\u201cI love you so much baby.\u201d</p><p>You grin, and whisper in his ear,\u00a0\u201cso I was right, you were jealous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my god y/n!

No I\u2019m not jealous, I don\u2019t know where you got <b>that </b>idea. Look sweetheart, I\u2019ve never been jealous, you know who has? Rhodey, when I drank the last of the whiskey, he was jealous. I Tony Stark have never been jealous.\u201d</p><p>You bit your lip and nodded,\u00a0\u201cRight, you know thats what people say when they are jealous.\u201d</p><p>Tony heaved a big sigh and walked like a lost puppy to you. He wrapped his arms around your torso and gave you a kiss on your forehead.\u00a0\u201c\u2026fine I may be a tiny bit jealous.\u201d</p><p>You smiled, feeling, unknown to you, happy that he felt that way.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI just don\u2019t want no one taking my baby away from me,\u201d Tony admitted.\u00a0</p><p>You hugged Tony back and kissed his lips lightly,\u00a0\u201cNo one would ever be able to do that. I love you too much, you are my one and only.\u201d You kiss him again but this time longer and more passionately.\u00a0</p><hr><p>The musical you were in was Hamilton. You grew in love with the cast and the music, literally everything. You were playing Eliza who was Alexander Hamilton\u2019s wife.\u00a0</p><p>Tony, who sang each and every song with you when you both were home, sang the songs whilst sitting in his seat watching you. You already sang\u00a0\u201cHelpless\u201d, and the kiss that Tony was so worried about was when Eliza and Alexander are at their wedding and they share a kiss.\u00a0</p><p>The kiss was to symbolize the love they have for each other.\u00a0</p><p>The wedding scene was about to start and you knew you had to make this kiss seem real.\u00a0</p><p>You went to the guy playing Hamilton and with your veil and bouquet of flowers with you, you slowly, lovingly, kissed the actor.\u00a0</p><p>You made sure the kiss was passionate but not too much. After the kiss happened everyone clapped at your performance. You looked all around at the audience until you spotted a familiar face. Tony\u2019s. But he didn\u2019t seem happy or glad. He was clapping but his face looked depressed. Worried, you knitted your eyebrows together. Was he really that hurt by the kiss?</p><hr><p>The musical was over and everyone loved it. They were amazed by all the actors, including your performance.\u00a0</p><p>You sprinted outside in search for Tony. Who was waiting patiently for you in the car.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSo babe,\u201d you said while getting in.\u00a0\u201cWhat\u2019d you think?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cOh yeah you did great,\u201d he gave you a thumbs up,\u00a0\u201cit was perfect.\u201d He turned away from you looking out the window.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cTony?\u201d You lightly touched his shoulder.

Tony its like your shutting me out, you\u2019re distant. Why? If its because that kiss I\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t think it would affect you that much. I promise I won\u2019t do any more of those.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIts not <b>just </b>about the kiss.\u201d<br></p><p>You shook your head,\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m not following.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I saw you kissing that guy, and the wedding music, it was all, it seemed real. I felt, like maybe you wouldn\u2019t want that with me cause of who I am. I feel like I might not ever give that to you. I\u2019m that guy who fought all those scary aliens, that guy that gets panic attacks and nightmares because of that day. I\u2019m damaged y/n, and sometimes I think I might not be able to give you that amazing life. So to answer your question earlier, yes, I am madly jealous of that guy. That he got to kiss somebody so incredible, somebody that deserves everything.\u201d<br></p><p>You knew Tony was overwhelmed and you would never wish that on him. You brought him into a hug, comforting him with your soothing voice.\u00a0\u201cBaby, I don\u2019t want anyone else. I don\u2019t care if you\u2019re damaged, I want to help you with that.

Not because you didn\u2019t have the abilities to rise above everyone\nelse when it came to grades but because you wanted to hide just that. Being a\ngenius among kids is not the best thing to be after all. Whenever a teacher\nwould praise you in front of the class you just wanted to hide from all the\neyes that were on you, like you always did. You didn\u2019t want the attention of a\nbunch of mean and jealous children. You were almost glad once you finished\nschool and went to college.</p><p>But now that you had finished\nthat too, you needed work experience. And what place could possibly be better\nthan the lab of your father and a genius with anger managing issues? You had\nbeen struggling to adjust at first with all the new people and the big compound\nbut thankfully everyone was keen to help. You loved the team dearly, all of\nthem being a part of your life now, someone protecting you from the evil in the\nworld additionally to your father. </p><p>They were a protective shield\naround you and you missed them when they were gone. It didn\u2019t bother you that\nthey would go on missions and leave you alone. You could deal with that. You\nalways had dealt with spending little time with your father anyways (which\ndidn\u2019t keep you from loving each other), you didn\u2019t want them to come back so\nthat they could protect you. It was quite the opposite. You wanted them to\nreturn so that you could keep them safe and protected. They deserved more: more\nlove and happiness, more quiet nights and healing. You wanted to give that to\nthem, every time they would return from a mission, every time you expected them\nnot to return and were proven otherwise. </p><p>So now, there you were, in\nyour bed, desperately waiting for that moment of relief and happiness pushing\naway every ounce of exhaustion and anxiety that bundled up in you through these\npast two weeks. Just as Tony had always been concerned for your safety you were\njust as concerned for his. His missions made you sleep less and worse, they\nmade you linger around the compound not letting you rest. They made your palms\nsweaty and unsteady every time you thought about the times he would return\nbloodied and bruised, your walk a little slower and your mind a little faster.\nSometimes it would send horrible thoughts racing through you, anxiety rippling\nalong with them. They made you stay awake until 2 AM, waiting for Friday to\nannounce his arrival. You waited for that now. </p><p>And just as you reflected on\nthe past two week you had spent alone in the base trying to figure out a way to\nspend the remaining time until the team arrived when - just like it had been\nreading your mind - the AI finally spoke to you: \u201cThe team has just arrived.\nEveryone is back and seems to suffer only minor injuries.\u201d </p><p>The sheets were sent flying to\nthe floor, your feet knowing their way around the compound well enough to find\nthe hangar by themselves now. </p><hr><p>Everyone had been tired,\nincluding you, eager to go (back) to bed and relax after the past fourteen\ndays, be it because of injuries or exhaustion, everyone in the compound needed\nand deserved a good night\u2019s sleep and everyone was on their way to get some\nexcept for Natasha. </p><p>She was tired, sure;\nexhausted, of course \u2013 how could she not be, she just spent two weeks with Sam\nand Bucky \u2013 but she couldn\u2019t unwind. Unlike everyone else she didn\u2019t relax\nthroughout the flight back home, the tension that had made its way into her\nmuscles never leaving or easing off even the tiniest bit. She needed stress\nrelief and the first thing that came to mind when thinking about that was,\nwell, sex. Unfortunately, there wasn\u2019t really anyone around she could have sex\nwith right now and she certainly was not in the mood to go out and look for\nsomeone. </p><p>Her feet hurt and a small but\nevil slash on her calf was keeping her from going anywhere outside of the\ncompound anyway. She could ask Steve to spend some time with her, she always\nfound peace in his presence, but he had been tired out the most during the\nmission, he deserved some sleep. As did every other team member. So, there was\nonly you left, which didn\u2019t bother her at all. </p><p>The two of you had spent a\ngreat amount of time together, even before you moved into the compound. She was\none of Tony\u2019s best friends, after all. But ever since she had got to know you\nshe had tried to keep you as far away from the danger that came along with\nbeing an Avenger. You weren\u2019t one and you certainly were never going to be one,\nbut Natasha\u2019s enemies wouldn\u2019t give a damn about that.

Not because you didn\u2019t have the abilities to rise above everyone\nelse when it came to grades but because you wanted to hide just that. Being a\ngenius among kids is not the best thing to be after all. Whenever a teacher\nwould praise you in front of the class you just wanted to hide from all the\neyes that were on you, like you always did.

It was quite the opposite. You wanted them to\nreturn so that you could keep them safe and protected. They deserved more: more\nlove and happiness, more quiet nights and healing. You wanted to give that to\nthem, every time they would return from a mission, every time you expected them\nnot to return and were proven otherwise. </p><p>So now, there you were, in\nyour bed, desperately waiting for that moment of relief and happiness pushing\naway every ounce of exhaustion and anxiety that bundled up in you through these\npast two weeks. Just as Tony had always been concerned for your safety you were\njust as concerned for his. His missions made you sleep less and worse, they\nmade you linger around the compound not letting you rest.
