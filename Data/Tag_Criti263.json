He\u2019s secondly aware of his broken right arm which shoots a bolt of screaming heat up his wrist to his shoulder socket. For a dizzy moment there\u2019s nothing but the pain. Thirdly, he realizes he\u2019s lying in a thin layer of watery mud, silt sliding around his body about half a foot deep and soaking his clothes and hair. Water is misting cool against his face.</p><p>His vision clarifies slowly, the sound of rumbling somewhere in a muffled distance and overhead there is a thin strip of daylight nearly half a mile away, shining through the gap between the two dark walls of ocean water. Too dizzy to panic, Molly registers that he\u2019s been relocated somewhere far along the road of the Crushing Deep and he can\u2019t remember anything about how. Nothing but fangs and wind.</p><p>Molly groans and rolls over. Hissing and gritting his teeth against a myriad jolting of broken bone, abrasions and bruises. His arms are scraped, his clothes ripped, rather like he had to grapple with a cheese grater\u2026 or a dragon with thousands of sharp, armored scales that was trying to hold him in its claws. Molly\u2019s aching head suggests he fell hard enough to knock the details out of his brain, but at some point he was dropped here. </p><p>The question is for how long.</p><!-- more --><p>He paws at his hip. </p><p>The scimitars are there. He digs into the satchel belt Nott gave him, pulls a vial of healing potion and uncorks it with his teeth and downs it. Shudders as the heat slides across his broken and bleeding parts and knits them shut, mending calcium and marrow until his broken arm aches, but functions. He tosses the vial, tries to stand\u2026 falls back to his knees, shivering with adrenaline. His tail curls instinctively around his right thigh, a shudder sliding though him. He feverishly congratulates past Mollymauk on being paranoid enough to sleep in full gear while he surveys the dark, watery corridor around him. </p><p>He\u2019s alone. </p><p>He looks behind him \u2013 there in the far distance is the light of the shore, the size of postage stamp from afar. </p><p>He looks ahead of him \u2013 the walls of water close like an arch so no sun can penetrate from above, turning the rest of the road into a dark tunnel leading into a deep, freezing blackness. All around him, he can see shadows moving in the dark waters, like humongous fish in an aquarium\u2026 but looking nothing like any fish or beast Molly\u2019s ever seen. </p><p>\u201cOh bloody hell,\u201d Molly whispers.</p><p>He forces himself up. He can\u2019t stop shivering. He\u2019s shaking so hard his teeth are chattering, but he doesn\u2019t feel any cold, just the neutral warmth off Nott\u2019s enchanted earrings as he turns and trudges toward the shore. Every step is unsteady, shivery with adrenaline. He folds his arms around him to stop the shaking. It doesn\u2019t work. Through the raw, driving instinct to keep moving, he still has a moment of shining, hysterical clarity just long enough to think: <i>Being dead must have been less stressful than this.</i></p><p>Then Nott\u2019s voice comes bursting in his ear: \u201cMolly! Don\u2019t worry! We\u2019re coming for you! Are you okay?\u201d Then at much higher, louder volumes, \u201cYOU CAN REPLY TO THIS MESSAGE!\u201d</p><p>Molly shakes off his immediate heart-stopping terror at being yelled at via Sending. Then he hisses, \u201cI\u2019m in the Crushing Deep. I\u2019m not hurt but hurry the fuck up.\u201d He glances at the dark waters on either side of him. \u201cI don\u2019t know where that dragon went or why it dropped me.\u201d</p><p>Then, while he\u2019s counting his words to determine if he has enough to add more, a voice directly behind him says, \u201cI\u2019m right here.\u201d</p><p>Molly hasn\u2019t been in a fight for ten years technically. That doesn\u2019t stop him from spinning around and slamming his right-handed scimitar to the goddamn hilt in the speaker\u2019s gut. Blood bursts cold over his fist, dripping heavily from his knuckles, the blade humming with a terrible joy that Nott hadn\u2019t warned him about. It surges a brief warm glow through Molly\u2019s body, sliding like fingers through lines of muscle. But that warmth is nothing in the face of the cold, hollow dread.</p><p>Because the speaker still looks exactly like Yasha.</p><p>She tilts her head, glances at the blade in her stomach, then grins at Molly through bloody human teeth. </p><p>\u201cNot very smart are you? Jumping out of a dragon\u2019s claws mid-air.\u201d</p><p>Molly slams the second scimitar up in her ribcage and wrenches, gets a satisfying huff of pain from the shape-changer. </p><p>He hisses, \u201cStop wearing my friend\u2019s face!\u201d</p><p>The monster ignores Molly, ignores the blades in her belly, grabs Molly\u2019s jaw in two hands, and yanks him forward, slamming her mouth against his with such force his lip splits and blood floods him mouth as the thing with Yasha\u2019s face drags a ravenous tongue between his teeth. She kisses him vicious, catching his lip between her teeth. Molly immediately rips both blades out and carves her flanks open in gaping, bloody holes. She ignores that\u2026 but when he wrenches back, she lets him go staggering.</p><p>\u201cNone of fucking that!\u201d Molly spits blood, baring teeth. </p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t hesitate.\u201d Not-Yasha grins. \u201cI\u2019m surprised with you, dead thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not dead,\u201d Molly snaps, backing up, blades in a defensive cross. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a dead thing tethered here on thread spun by gods,\u201d says Not-Yasha. Her sides are knitting back together. \u201cThere\u2019s power in that. Power you can <i>eat</i>if you\u2019re hungry enough.\u201d She\u2019s walking toward him, forcing Molly to back away. \u201cI could eat you alive over and over. Until your gods give up on you and leave you a corpse at last.\u201d She smiles and blood floods black from her mouth. \u201cUnless they don\u2019t. We could consume you forever, Mollymauk. Imagine.\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cFuck off,\u201d</i>Molly says in Infernal to mask how gut-twisting <i>terrifying</i>that possibility is. \u201cMy friends are coming to kill you. I hear they\u2019re strong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re oh <i>so</i>fucking weak.\u201d Not-Yasha moves toward him again, slowly, unhurried. \u201cThey can\u2019t protect you. Obviously. What could I do to you before they get here? You\u2019re nothing except a thing that won\u2019t stay dead.\u201d Her hand comes up, spread toward him. \u201cBut before I take you to him\u2026 I need you to\u2013\u201c</p><p>Molly whips the scimitar across his body, blinding fast, then jumps back and to the left.</p><p>Monster-Yasha stares at the sudden bloody stump at the end of her wrist. \u201cHmm,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m going to take your guts out one at a time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho the fuck are you?\u201d Molly hisses. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cDid you really think your orc brat was the only one bound to the Great Serpent?\u201d She smiles and the smile becomes lipless, taut across the skull. \u201cYou should fall to your knees, dead thing. Your gods can\u2019t protect you here.\u201d</p><p>But before Molly can process the horrifying implications, there\u2019s a gun shot. The monster\u2019s head snaps back, a burst of red mist flowering from the skull and Not-Yasha staggers back a single step, her neck arched backward with the hit, but she does not fall. Molly jerks around just in time to see Nott, crouched in the road with a dimension door sliding shut behind her, as she lines up another shot and screams, \u201cSHEILD, MOLLY!\u201d</p><p>He activates the spell and drops to a ball with his hands over his ears. Nott fires again. She hits Not-Yasha as she starts to come back up (her body twitching horribly, splitting apart like rotten fruit peeling open\u2013) and the shot detonates. The blast is so powerful, it ignites the air and the entire road is fire and super-heated steam, the kinetic force sucked the barrier bowed around Molly\u2019s body. The air super-heats, so hot his bare skin blisters. </p><p>\u201cAGAIN! SHEILD AGAIN!\u201d</p><p>Molly brings up the other sword, activates the spell and the second wall comes up and for a split second through the smoke and steam, Molly sees something massive erupting upward in horrible jerking bursts of bone and flesh. Then she hits it with another explosive shot and this time the force is so powerful Molly is pinned flat in the mud, his shield like a bell jar on top of him, keeping out the fire. The spell sputters, flares, then dies\u2026 and the road is seemingly empty.</p><p>Molly levers himself up onto his hands and knees where he retches for a moment. His hands are sunk to the wrist in silt and fine sand, slithering sea-life writhing in the mud beneath his fingers but he\u2019s too busy hacking up a lung to notice or care. He shakes his hair out of his face, grabs for his scimitar \u2013</p><p>And that\u2019s when the ground beneath him shudders.</p><p>\u201cOh fuck,\u201d Molly manages before five massive claws burst from the sand and close over him in a gargantuan fist. Molly has just enough instinct to lunge for the largest visible gap between the thumb and forefinger before the dragon\u2019s claws snap shut around his lower body. Then he\u2019s being yanked upward with such velocity the world blurs. He sees things in wild snap shots, the water, his own forearm braced against mottle blue-white scales, the underbelly of a beast.</p><p>Pain flares through the bones in his legs and pelvis, shooting across every nerve, but he can\u2019t focus on that. Molly\u2019s moving so fucking fast he can\u2019t see, being jolted, vertigo yanking his stomach out through his throat as the ground rushes and swings wildly away. He feels the mithril chain shirt is digging through his ribs, but even so he finds enough air to scream as loud as he can:</p><p>\u201cNOTT! SHOOT IT! JUST SHOOT IT\u2014!\u201d</p><p>A bullet slams into the trunk of the dragon\u2019s arm somewhere at the elbow\u2026 then detonates. The bullet blows the entire center out of it. Then, blasted free of the main body and spraying burning cold blood, it begins to fall\u2026 with Molly still gripped in its dead hold. He tears loose, driving his boot back into the fist holding him until a giant claw comes loose, then he launches straight forward, ripping free and then he\u2019s falling free. The wind roars, tearing across his ears, the momentum ripping at his clothes and \u2013</p><p>\u201cMolly!\u201d</p><p>Yasha materializes in the air directly beneath him and he slams into her chest, solid as a wall and driving the air straight out of him, but her limbs close around and the field of her levitation seizes hold of him. Then they\u2019re rocketing backward together. Yasha wheels in reverse, downward, then spins around to right them before she comes to a messy, skidding landing in the briny mud. Their boots drag in the sludge, then they\u2019re still on the ground. </p><p>\u201cGood catch,\u201d Molly pants, untangling himself. </p><p>He looks up over his shoulder and there, wheeling in the air between the watery canyon walls, gleams the flying bulk of a massive blue-black sea dragon. Dark and serpentine, born on leathery wings and magic, its eyes gleam luminous yellow, slit up the center, and even now are fixed on Molly. The back-draft of its wings like hurricane winds, batter and tear at hair and clothes. Blood pours from the severed stump of its right arm.</p><p>He snaps his fingers and both of his lost scimitars reappear in their sheathes at his hip. As he pulls both free, he shouts over the wind, \u201cYou wanna kill that thing or what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop getting knocked around and I will,\u201d says Yasha. Her eyes flare suddenly bottle blue and burning. She flips her weapon into her hand, gripping it two handed before planting her feet and launching with such force the mud bursts away from the point of liftoff. Molly immediately races back toward Nott who is screaming something like \u201cGODS DAMMIT! WHY IS IT ALWAYS LIKE THIS?\u201d and reloading frantically. </p><p>Molly reaches her, flips his blades across the back of his neck, and drags \u2013 feels that familiar burn of metal splitting and separating skin. Radiant fire ignites along the edge, like his blood is ignition fluid and the whole blade immediately goes up in light. The rite latches onto his soul, part of his very life force living now in the swords and it\u2019s terrifying and comforting all at once. Then he\u2019s standing side-by-side with Nott the Brave and for the first time things feel familiar.</p><p>\u201cJust like old times,\u201d Molly shouts over the monstrous eldritch roaring. </p><p>\u201cTHIS IS NOTHING LIKE OLD TIMES,\u201d Nott screeches. </p><p>She fires again at the pinwheeling form of the dragon. It currently snapping its massive jaws, its enormous serpentine neck lashing back and forth at Yasha who, in the split second that it took her to move, rockets past and lumber-jack hacks her blade five feed deep into an armored shoulder. Molly feels the air shiver. There\u2019s a flash. Then a boom that shakes the sea as a massive bolt of lightning strikes the blade like a rod, conducting holy blue fire directly into bone. </p><p>The dragon <i>screams</i>. Writhes in agony, electricity crackling all across its form, then in a frenzy it grabs Yasha with its one good hand. Claws her from its shoulder. Then it throws her straight through the water wall with such force Yasha hits it like concrete, the surface bursting a geyser of impact, before she vanishes deep into the horizontal sea. </p><p>\u201cBitch!\u201d rumbles the dragon, spinning in the air to look down on the gunslinger and Mollymauk. </p><p>Even at nearly 100 feet away, Molly can see the vindictive gleam in its predator stare. Then the beast rears its head back, a sudden sluice of sea water spilling over from draconic jaws and Molly hears Nott whisper, \u201cOh fuck, oh fuck, oh fuck \u2013!\u201d</p><p>Molly, not thinking very clearly at his point, just snarls \u201c<i>FUCK YOU</i>!\u201d with all the Infernal hate he can gather and feels a blood vessel tear open along his neck. The dragon\u2019s yellow eyes immediately blacken and run with darkness just in time for Nott to yell, \u201cDRAGONS CAN\u2019T BE BLINDED, MOLLY!\u201d and the beast unleashes a blast of tidal waters from its throat. </p><p>Time freezes for a spilt of a split of a second. Molly thinks \u2013 <i>Shit, this is exactly like the last time I used a Blood Maledict.</i>\u2013 and then the water that most certainly was meant to hit them head on like a crushing geyser\u2026 misses by about ten feet and the water slams into the wall of magical ocean to their left, bursting and frothing up against the arcane barrier and flooding the ground behind them in a massive arc up the Demali road. The water is freezing cold as it rushes back downhill, soaking Molly up to his knees and nearly knocking Nott from her footing. </p><p>The dragon is shrieking and clawing at its face. It hits the earth behind them on all fours, roaring, \u201cWHERE ARE YOU?!\u201d It thrashes its head, spitting water and screaming, \u201cYOU MEWLING IMP! I\u2019LL KILL YOU! I\u2019ll KILL YOU!\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be damned,\u201d Nott hisses, then grabs Molly and starts hauling him fast back toward the shore. \u201cRun, run, run! If it gets close, it will definitely see us! You lucky fucking bastard I can\u2019t believe that worked!\u201d</p><p>And they sprint like hell away.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s is Caduceus!?\u201d Molly yells as they run. </p><p>\u201cThat godsdamned dragon attacked him while we were sleeping!\u201d Nott, Molly notices, sounds like she\u2019s in tears. \u201cWe had to stabilize him before coming after you. I don\u2019t know if he\u2019ll be able to help us!\u201d</p><p>Behind them they can hear the monster still roaring and cursing Molly in a slew of Draconic and Common. </p><p>Then there\u2019s a thunder clap. A flash of blue light ignites the air around them. Molly\u2019s pulse skips and he spins just in time to see Yasha erupting from the sea wall like dark screaming meteorite and slam into the dragon\u2019s ribs. She\u2019s yelling. Her voice echoes down the road, blood-chilling and psychotic, as she impacts and drives her sword over and over and over into the dragon\u2019s flank like an assassin with a dagger except it\u2019s a longsword composed of black metal and lightning. </p><p>Suddenly the phrase, \u2018<i>I\u2019ve killed dragons before\u2019</i>takes on more meaning as a singular solo action.</p><p>The dragon is screaming and rearing away from the hideous one-woman onslaught. Yasha gets in two more blows, goring a massive, gushing flap of muscle open under her blade before the great drake rears up, roaring, and bats Yasha off like a cat smacking a mouse. Yasha rockets to the ground, smashing into the it. Then, before she can move from the impact zone, the giant sea dragon darts forward\u2026. and snaps its jaws down on her. Mollymauk\u2019s world goes absolutely cold around him. The dragon rips its head back and forth like a Rottweiler with a hare, brutalizing and snarling, then it hurls Yasha\u2019s broken form to the side of the road where it hits in a crumpled twist of necrotic wings and shredded armor. </p><p>There she lies still. </p><p>Molly is screaming before the deed is even done. \u201c<i>YASHA</i>!\u201d </p><p>Nott grabs his wrist top stop him the second he tries to run back. </p><p>\u201cNo! Wait, Molly! WAIT! She\u2019s in a Battle Trance! She\u2019ll be fine! Just \u2013!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t bloody believe you!\u201d Molly cries. </p><p>Nott looks stricken for just a moment, then seems to accept that. She reloads. \u201cFine. Get behind me.\u201d She kneels down in the road beside him and lines up another shot. \u201cYasha will get up. I promise.\u201d</p><p>She fires twice and the both shots detonate across the dragon\u2019s armored chest, one tearing more deeply into the wounds already inflicted by Yasha, blowing a fresh geyser of blood from the beast. But Molly isn\u2019t looking at that. He\u2019s looking at his friend who lies dead in the road, torn and broken, her skeletal wings bent like crushed origami in the mud, her arms limp and twisted around her. Molly registers despair as a rising ache inside him \u2013 new and different from all the dread and terror leading up until now. </p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll be okay,\u201d Nott says again. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, Molly. The cavalry is coming. I know it!\u201d</p><p>Molly, confused, starts to say, \u201cWho\u2019s the caval\u2013?\u201d</p><p>And then Caduceus Clay materializes at Molly\u2019s side. </p><p>Molly jumps. The cleric glances at him. His eyes are entirely composed of soft green light, burning like twin stares trapped in his skull. There is plant-life growing rapidly across his armor, moss and lichen spreading and flowering, thin ferns unfurling from chinks in the plate armor and spiraling up into his pale pink mane. He stops for just a moment to touch Mollymauk\u2019s shoulder and Molly feels an infusion of warmth through him, a light sinking into his skin like sunshine into a flower. It inhabits him completely, like someone embracing every part of him at once and Molly can\u2019t catch his breath. </p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not alone out here,\u201d says Caduceus. \u00a0</p><p>Then he turns his attention to the dragon, points his staff directly at the ground\u2026 and the earth erupts. </p><p>A shunt of living wood the length and thickness of a ship\u2019s mast slams up through the massive ribcage, spearing and driving through with such force, the creature leaves the ground and is hung momentarily impaled by a rapidly growing cedar tree. It\u2019s branches and canopy expand with unnatural speed within the chest cavity of the creature, threatening to crack the bowed bone structures out like a fist opening inside a corn husk.</p><p>\u201cNO!\u201d The dragon is screaming, writhing, still alive somehow. Blood sprays from its mouth, from its perforated ribs but still it screams, \u201cNO NO NO!\u201d </p><p>It seizes hold of the great tree beneath it in one massive claw and with an unfathomable brute strength, it tears the entire trunk into two splintery pieces. Caduceus flinches, like he felt the blow and the dragon falls to earth on four gargantuan legs. Bleeding, still speared by the head of the tree, its branches lodged inside its chest cavity, bone gleams bare along its flanks. It\u2019s missing one arm, drooling blood and sea foam. Psychotic, pain-feverish eyes turn on the three of them in the road and its gaze seems to punch through Molly\u2019s soul. </p><p>\u201cThe Leviathan,\u201d it gargles, laughing, \u201cwill have you all.\u201d </p><p>Caduceus throws out his free hand, palm out, and pink light gathers in his fingers. He whispers something and the word pulses through the ground like a tremor and instantly thousands of vines spiral up from the mud, spraying sand, and lash themselves around the dragon\u2019s limbs. But the bulk of the beast is too enormous and it pulls free of them, begins to advance up the road toward them. </p><p>\u201cThe Sea will swallow you whole!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m out of artillery!\u201d Nott fires two shots directly into the dragon\u2019s armored head, briefly knocking its skull aside before it rears back, snarling. \u201cClay!? Any other word from Melora?!\u201d </p><p>\u201cI can do something,\u201d Molly whispers. \u201cI think\u2026 I think I can try something.\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo, Molly!\u201d Nott sounds terrified. \u201cIt\u2019s a fucking dragon! You won\u2019t get lucky again!\u201d</p><p>Caduceus surprised, stares at the tiefling besides him even as an ancient dragon thunders down on them. \u201cYou\u2019re much braver than I imagined you.\u201d His soft firbolg features kind of wrinkle. Even possessed by divine fire, it makes him strangely young as he murmurs, \u201cI\u2019m sorry for all of this.\u201d</p><p>The dragon is howling, \u201cUK\u2019OTOA WILL CONSUME THE WORLD!\u201d</p><p>And Molly grips the swords, feels them sing through his palms, and easy as muscle memory he leans his shoulder back into some previously untouchable membrane, suddenly tangible against his skin. He pushes through it, like you shoulder aside a veil, and side-steps through into another dimension. Time hits him like a heavy velvet curtain, smacking into and enveloping him\u2026 then it slides off like silk and he stands free and alone. The world around burns and blurs gray and white, the edges of everything fuzzy and static \u2013 Caduceus frozen in the attitude of looking down at him, Nott crouched there in the muddy road with her weapon. </p><p>Molly turns, arcane winds rushing silent around him.</p><p>He can see the dragon. Black in the strange hyper-contrast of the realm around him, moving in slow motion, one claw raised in mid-stride, the mud spraying up around its massive footfall as it begins to spring forward at the cleric and gun-slinger before it. The world is silent, utterly soundless around him. But there\u2019s a vibration in his skull and that vibration leave a hum inside him and the hum is telling him to move, move, move.</p><p>So he moves. </p><p>He darts down the road. The water on the road separates under his boots, sprays in real-time as he touches it, then slows as he passes from contact until a thirty-foot trail of frozen sole-shaped footprints are left in the slowed waters behind him. And Molly is sprinting. Lungs burning, fast as he can, the scimitars blazing white in his fists as he reaches the dragon, still hung over him and moving so slow it may as well be holding still and he knows by instinct he has just moments. Just seconds to do this thing.</p><p>He\u2019s directly next to the dragon\u2019s left foreleg, like a black tree trunk beside him and sure as he knows how, Mollymauk swings both scimitars one after another directly into the ankle and the blades cleave through like a butcher\u2019s knife through beef. Blood sprays, slows, hangs in the air and Molly spins and swings again just one more time and this time the blow slams clear through\u2026</p><p>\u2026 and the world snaps back into color and time. </p><p>The dragon\u2019s forearm cracks in half instantly as their full weight comes down on the limb and Molly dives right just in time to narrowly avoid being crushed. The dragon hits the ground skidding on its chest, both forelegs dismembered and dragging bloody beneath it. Molly hears shrieking. Thunderous roars as he stumbles up, running toward the water wall as the road behind him is suddenly full of thrashing, screaming dragon. Maimed and howling. Molly shoves himself back again the sea wall, the ocean soaking his shirt from behind. The magic slides up his back, shivering on skin, but all he sees is the dragon. </p><p>Its tail lashes wildly, slamming into the earth near him, whipping and slicing through the water over his head, soaking Molly where he huddles, heart hammering in his throat while the giant creature surges unstoppably through its death throes. Molly knows it\u2019s dying. He knows because he can see where the branches of the tree have rammed up through the dragon\u2019s back, fully penetrating the chest when the beast fell forward, driving the stake fatally deeper with its own momentum. </p><p>\u201cMolly!\u201d Nott is yelling from somewhere, but he can\u2019t see her. \u201cMolly where are you!?\u201d</p><p>He stays frozen, pressed against the water. Anticipating the random blow that will kill him, knock him again into that black void where no memory survives. Again the tail lashes near him and he cries out, closing his eyes. \u00a0</p><p>\u201c<i>Molly</i>?!\u201d</p><p>\u201cC\u2019mon,\u201d Molly whispers, to who he\u2019s not sure, \u201cC\u2019mon. Give me a bloody break.\u201d </p><p>He feels something slam into the ground nearby, the shards of rock spraying across his cheek. He hears the dragon choking, a horrible deafening sound like all the steam going out in a forge and the gargle of blood and sea water. He smells it. Smells the blood soaking his boots in the salt water. He\u2019s past the adrenaline smooth rush where the chemical makes him instinct and on to the part where it leaves him shaking. He stands there, back against the sea, swords burning in his hand, just waiting stock still and whispering\u2026 </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you fucking dare. Don\u2019t you bloody fucking\u2026\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s silence. Silence. </p><p>Molly opens his eyes.</p><p>The dragon is dead. It\u2019s laying there, still, a gleaming black and blue mountain of armor and bloody limbs. He can\u2019t see its head from where he\u2019s standing but the great dome of its flank is still \u2013 totally empty of breath. Molly stares. His heart hammers clean in his chest, keeps beating. And for a single, shining moment Molly\u2019s just standing there with radiant fire in his fists, and there is something so fucking familiar, so goddamn innate about this that he knows it down to his veins that this body has stood over monsters before. Down to the blood in his veins he <i>knows</i>this\u2026</p><p>\u2026 and then he feels the water displace at his back and before he can react, a soaking arm hooks around his waist and a hand cased in barnacles clamps over his windpipe&hellip; and Fjord says in his ear, \u201cDon\u2019t move.\u201d</p><p>And pulls Molly back through a portal in the water. \u00a0 </p><p><br/></p><hr><p><br/></p><p>\u201cCAN YOU NOT?!\u201d Molly is yelling before he\u2019s even through the portal. The dimensions tear around him, a warping of reality that blinds him instantly and for a moment Molly feels his brain lock, unable to comprehend the quantum ripping around him and with a sudden violent jolt through every cell in his body, it ends. He comes to a stumbling stop, staggering, boots hitting solid ground as he jerks free the warlock gripping him. He spins away, bringing the still blazing scimitars up between them. \u201cStop fucking dragging me around! All of you! Bloody back off for a breath!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMolly,\u201d Fjord starts to say, holding up two hands, palms spread toward him. \u201cMolly. Listen to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! What the fuck are you doing?!\u201d </p><p>Molly looks wildly around, finds himself standing in\u2026 some kind of limitless space, water up to the ankles of his boots. The liquid beneath him shimmers like an oil with dark shifting reflections, seething shapes mirrored in an iridescent infinity on all sides of him. A horizon-less dark extends forever in all directions and the only point of distance at all, is Fjord, standing in front of him. There is nothing but the watery dark, Molly, and Fjord who is begging him, softly:</p><p>\u201cPlease listen.\u201d </p><p>\u201cStay away from me. Why did you bring me here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI tried to warn you. Godsdammit, I tried. I have a minute here.\u201d</p><p>Molly backs away, swords still up. \u201cNo. No bloody way. You don\u2019t get to do this too. You don\u2019t get to sweep in at the last second like a fucking \u2013!\u201d Molly sputters, panic and rage stealing all coherence for an instant. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with you? What happened? What did you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI made it too powerful, Molly. It came through the dimensions and it was gonna consume my home. I had to do something. I said it could have me if it would just stop.\u201d Fjord laughs, but it\u2019s a ragged exhausted sound. \u201cHow long has it been since it took me? Do you know, Mollymauk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA\u2026 a few years I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d </p><p>\u201cThe others tried to rescue you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. Have you seen Jester?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Molly swallows. \u201cNo one has.\u201d</p><p>Fjord nods, his eyes drifting shut, like hearing it is a relief he\u2019d been waiting on. \u201cGood,\u201d he murmurs. \u201cGood, okay.\u201d He opens his eyes again, manages this lopsided kind of grin, almost rueful. \u201cIt\u2019s really good to see you, Molly. You know that? I just\u2026 I honestly can\u2019t believe you\u2019re really here.\u201d The smile vanishes. \u201cI can\u2019t fuckin\u2019 believe this is how we meet again.\u201d</p><p>Molly hedges a moment. \u201cWe\u2019re still friends, right, Fjord?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. For what it\u2019s worth.\u201d</p><p>Molly feels bile bite the back of his throat. \u201cHow long do you have?\u201d He\u2019s shivering. \u201cHow long before your patron comes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly for a minute more. Molly, I\u2019m sorry. You died \u2018cause y\u2019all trusted me to look out for you and I didn\u2019t. I tried to do better after that. Thought I did. Saved the world and all that but now\u2026\u201d</p><p>Molly lowers his voice. \u201cI\u2019m glad my death was a such a learning experience for all of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mean it that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFjord,\u201d Molly whispers, \u201cwhy did you bring me here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t bargain with him anymore. I don\u2019t have anything left to give,\u201d Fjord says. \u201cHe wants you.\u201d</p><p>Molly\u2019s guts clench like there\u2019s a fist in them. \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust don\u2019t\u2026 don\u2019t fight it, Molly.\u201d Fjord\u2019s eyes glow yellow. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>Molly backs away, a red ache opening through him and the ache is dread, so familiar to him now it feels like he\u2019s never been without it. \u201cFjord?\u201d He gets no response, raises his voice, desperation in his throat like an Infernal reverb. \u201cFjord! Don\u2019t\u2014!\u201d</p><p>Then thing that\u2019s living in Fjord <i>looks\u00a0</i>at him. </p><p>The gaze cuts through Mollymauk like a blow. It cleaves through his head like red iron through ice, tunneling a burning hole in his psyche and Molly screams because there is literally nothing else he can do. Every muscle in his body goes taut and he nearly bites his tongue in half as an immediate grand mal seizure tears through him, but he\u2019s horribly somehow still on his feet, standing there while his body goes into a series of agonizing convulsions. He drops his weapons and they extinguish. </p><p>There\u2019s nothing except the pain. The grind of his teeth, his every muscle cramping so tight it\u2019s like they\u2019 going to snap like violin wire across his skeleton. It <i>hurts</i>. His hands are locked at his sides, fingers curled into helpless claws as his spine bends backward, his eyes rolling in his skull until he can\u2019t see anything. He\u2019s just\u2026 stuck there. Somewhere between dying and not-dying and he can\u2019t even fall down. He can\u2019t scream or speak anymore. There\u2019s just dark and heat and the muffled sound of his voice trapped in his throat. </p><p>He barely feels it when Fjord\u2019s hand settles around his windpipe and at the back of his head. </p><p>\u201cGods I\u2019m sorry,\u201d Fjord says, his voice hollow with horror. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m so sorry. Don\u2019t come back, Molly. He\u2019ll keep doing this if you don\u2019t. Just go.\u201d</p><p><i>Fuck you</i>, Molly thinks. <i>Fuck you, I don\u2019t know how this works, gods dammit\u2013</i></p><p>Fjord snaps his neck. </p><p style=\"\"><br/></p><p><a href=\"http://punishandenslavesuckers.tumblr.com/post/179047961511/mollymauk-tealeaf-wakes-up-in-a-grave-by-the-road\" target=\"_blank\">go to part 7</a></p>",

He digs into the satchel belt Nott gave him, pulls a vial of healing potion and uncorks it with his teeth and downs it. Shudders as the heat slides across his broken and bleeding parts and knits them shut, mending calcium and marrow until his broken arm aches, but functions. He tosses the vial, tries to stand\u2026 falls back to his knees, shivering with adrenaline. His tail curls instinctively around his right thigh, a shudder sliding though him. He feverishly congratulates past Mollymauk on being paranoid enough to sleep in full gear while he surveys the dark, watery corridor around him. </p><p>He\u2019s alone. </p><p>He looks behind him \u2013 there in the far distance is the light of the shore, the size of postage stamp from afar. </p><p>He looks ahead of him \u2013 the walls of water close like an arch so no sun can penetrate from above, turning the rest of the road into a dark tunnel leading into a deep, freezing blackness. All around him, he can see shadows moving in the dark waters, like humongous fish in an aquarium\u2026 but looking nothing like any fish or beast Molly\u2019s ever seen. </p><p>\u201cOh bloody hell,\u201d Molly whispers.</p><p>He forces himself up. He can\u2019t stop shivering. He\u2019s shaking so hard his teeth are chattering, but he doesn\u2019t feel any cold, just the neutral warmth off Nott\u2019s enchanted earrings as he turns and trudges toward the shore. Every step is unsteady, shivery with adrenaline. He folds his arms around him to stop the shaking. It doesn\u2019t work. Through the raw, driving instinct to keep moving, he still has a moment of shining, hysterical clarity just long enough to think: <i>Being dead must have been less stressful than this.</i></p><p>Then Nott\u2019s voice comes bursting in his ear: \u201cMolly! Don\u2019t worry! We\u2019re coming for you! Are you okay?\u201d Then at much higher, louder volumes, \u201cYOU CAN REPLY TO THIS MESSAGE!\u201d</p><p>Molly shakes off his immediate heart-stopping terror at being yelled at via Sending. Then he hisses, \u201cI\u2019m in the Crushing Deep. I\u2019m not hurt but hurry the fuck up.\u201d He glances at the dark waters on either side of him. \u201cI don\u2019t know where that dragon went or why it dropped me.\u201d</p><p>Then, while he\u2019s counting his words to determine if he has enough to add more, a voice directly behind him says, \u201cI\u2019m right here.\u201d</p><p>Molly hasn\u2019t been in a fight for ten years technically. That doesn\u2019t stop him from spinning around and slamming his right-handed scimitar to the goddamn hilt in the speaker\u2019s gut. Blood bursts cold over his fist, dripping heavily from his knuckles, the blade humming with a terrible joy that Nott hadn\u2019t warned him about. It surges a brief warm glow through Molly\u2019s body, sliding like fingers through lines of muscle. But that warmth is nothing in the face of the cold, hollow dread.</p><p>Because the speaker still looks exactly like Yasha.</p><p>She tilts her head, glances at the blade in her stomach, then grins at Molly through bloody human teeth. </p><p>\u201cNot very smart are you? Jumping out of a dragon\u2019s claws mid-air.\u201d</p><p>Molly slams the second scimitar up in her ribcage and wrenches, gets a satisfying huff of pain from the shape-changer. </p><p>He hisses, \u201cStop wearing my friend\u2019s face!\u201d</p><p>The monster ignores Molly, ignores the blades in her belly, grabs Molly\u2019s jaw in two hands, and yanks him forward, slamming her mouth against his with such force his lip splits and blood floods him mouth as the thing with Yasha\u2019s face drags a ravenous tongue between his teeth. She kisses him vicious, catching his lip between her teeth. Molly immediately rips both blades out and carves her flanks open in gaping, bloody holes. She ignores that\u2026 but when he wrenches back, she lets him go staggering.</p><p>\u201cNone of fucking that!\u201d Molly spits blood, baring teeth. </p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t hesitate.\u201d Not-Yasha grins. \u201cI\u2019m surprised with you, dead thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not dead,\u201d Molly snaps, backing up, blades in a defensive cross. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a dead thing tethered here on thread spun by gods,\u201d says Not-Yasha. Her sides are knitting back together. \u201cThere\u2019s power in that. Power you can <i>eat</i>if you\u2019re hungry enough.\u201d She\u2019s walking toward him, forcing Molly to back away. \u201cI could eat you alive over and over. Until your gods give up on you and leave you a corpse at last.\u201d She smiles and blood floods black from her mouth. \u201cUnless they don\u2019t. We could consume you forever, Mollymauk. Imagine.\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cFuck off,\u201d</i>Molly says in Infernal to mask how gut-twisting <i>terrifying</i>that possibility is. \u201cMy friends are coming to kill you. I hear they\u2019re strong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re oh <i>so</i>fucking weak.\u201d Not-Yasha moves toward him again, slowly, unhurried. \u201cThey can\u2019t protect you. Obviously. What could I do to you before they get here? You\u2019re nothing except a thing that won\u2019t stay dead.\u201d Her hand comes up, spread toward him. \u201cBut before I take you to him\u2026 I need you to\u2013\u201c</p><p>Molly whips the scimitar across his body, blinding fast, then jumps back and to the left.</p><p>Monster-Yasha stares at the sudden bloody stump at the end of her wrist. \u201cHmm,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m going to take your guts out one at a time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho the fuck are you?\u201d Molly hisses. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cDid you really think your orc brat was the only one bound to the Great Serpent?\u201d She smiles and the smile becomes lipless, taut across the skull. \u201cYou should fall to your knees, dead thing. Your gods can\u2019t protect you here.\u201d</p><p>But before Molly can process the horrifying implications, there\u2019s a gun shot. The monster\u2019s head snaps back, a burst of red mist flowering from the skull and Not-Yasha staggers back a single step, her neck arched backward with the hit, but she does not fall. Molly jerks around just in time to see Nott, crouched in the road with a dimension door sliding shut behind her, as she lines up another shot and screams, \u201cSHEILD, MOLLY!\u201d</p><p>He activates the spell and drops to a ball with his hands over his ears. Nott fires again. She hits Not-Yasha as she starts to come back up (her body twitching horribly, splitting apart like rotten fruit peeling open\u2013) and the shot detonates. The blast is so powerful, it ignites the air and the entire road is fire and super-heated steam, the kinetic force sucked the barrier bowed around Molly\u2019s body. The air super-heats, so hot his bare skin blisters. </p><p>\u201cAGAIN! SHEILD AGAIN!\u201d</p><p>Molly brings up the other sword, activates the spell and the second wall comes up and for a split second through the smoke and steam, Molly sees something massive erupting upward in horrible jerking bursts of bone and flesh. Then she hits it with another explosive shot and this time the force is so powerful Molly is pinned flat in the mud, his shield like a bell jar on top of him, keeping out the fire. The spell sputters, flares, then dies\u2026 and the road is seemingly empty.</p><p>Molly levers himself up onto his hands and knees where he retches for a moment. His hands are sunk to the wrist in silt and fine sand, slithering sea-life writhing in the mud beneath his fingers but he\u2019s too busy hacking up a lung to notice or care. He shakes his hair out of his face, grabs for his scimitar \u2013</p><p>And that\u2019s when the ground beneath him shudders.</p><p>\u201cOh fuck,\u201d Molly manages before five massive claws burst from the sand and close over him in a gargantuan fist. Molly has just enough instinct to lunge for the largest visible gap between the thumb and forefinger before the dragon\u2019s claws snap shut around his lower body. Then he\u2019s being yanked upward with such velocity the world blurs. He sees things in wild snap shots, the water, his own forearm braced against mottle blue-white scales, the underbelly of a beast.</p><p>Pain flares through the bones in his legs and pelvis, shooting across every nerve, but he can\u2019t focus on that. Molly\u2019s moving so fucking fast he can\u2019t see, being jolted, vertigo yanking his stomach out through his throat as the ground rushes and swings wildly away. He feels the mithril chain shirt is digging through his ribs, but even so he finds enough air to scream as loud as he can:</p><p>\u201cNOTT! SHOOT IT! JUST SHOOT IT\u2014!\u201d</p><p>A bullet slams into the trunk of the dragon\u2019s arm somewhere at the elbow\u2026 then detonates. The bullet blows the entire center out of it. Then, blasted free of the main body and spraying burning cold blood, it begins to fall\u2026 with Molly still gripped in its dead hold. He tears loose, driving his boot back into the fist holding him until a giant claw comes loose, then he launches straight forward, ripping free and then he\u2019s falling free. The wind roars, tearing across his ears, the momentum ripping at his clothes and \u2013</p><p>\u201cMolly!\u201d</p><p>Yasha materializes in the air directly beneath him and he slams into her chest, solid as a wall and driving the air straight out of him, but her limbs close around and the field of her levitation seizes hold of him. Then they\u2019re rocketing backward together. Yasha wheels in reverse, downward, then spins around to right them before she comes to a messy, skidding landing in the briny mud. Their boots drag in the sludge, then they\u2019re still on the ground. </p><p>\u201cGood catch,\u201d Molly pants, untangling himself. </p><p>He looks up over his shoulder and there, wheeling in the air between the watery canyon walls, gleams the flying bulk of a massive blue-black sea dragon. Dark and serpentine, born on leathery wings and magic, its eyes gleam luminous yellow, slit up the center, and even now are fixed on Molly. The back-draft of its wings like hurricane winds, batter and tear at hair and clothes. Blood pours from the severed stump of its right arm.</p><p>He snaps his fingers and both of his lost scimitars reappear in their sheathes at his hip. As he pulls both free, he shouts over the wind, \u201cYou wanna kill that thing or what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop getting knocked around and I will,\u201d says Yasha. Her eyes flare suddenly bottle blue and burning. She flips her weapon into her hand, gripping it two handed before planting her feet and launching with such force the mud bursts away from the point of liftoff. Molly immediately races back toward Nott who is screaming something like \u201cGODS DAMMIT! WHY IS IT ALWAYS LIKE THIS?\u201d and reloading frantically. </p><p>Molly reaches her, flips his blades across the back of his neck, and drags \u2013 feels that familiar burn of metal splitting and separating skin. Radiant fire ignites along the edge, like his blood is ignition fluid and the whole blade immediately goes up in light. The rite latches onto his soul, part of his very life force living now in the swords and it\u2019s terrifying and comforting all at once. Then he\u2019s standing side-by-side with Nott the Brave and for the first time things feel familiar.</p><p>\u201cJust like old times,\u201d Molly shouts over the monstrous eldritch roaring. </p><p>\u201cTHIS IS NOTHING LIKE OLD TIMES,\u201d Nott screeches. </p><p>She fires again at the pinwheeling form of the dragon. It currently snapping its massive jaws, its enormous serpentine neck lashing back and forth at Yasha who, in the split second that it took her to move, rockets past and lumber-jack hacks her blade five feed deep into an armored shoulder. Molly feels the air shiver. There\u2019s a flash. Then a boom that shakes the sea as a massive bolt of lightning strikes the blade like a rod, conducting holy blue fire directly into bone. </p><p>The dragon <i>screams</i>. Writhes in agony, electricity crackling all across its form, then in a frenzy it grabs Yasha with its one good hand. Claws her from its shoulder. Then it throws her straight through the water wall with such force Yasha hits it like concrete, the surface bursting a geyser of impact, before she vanishes deep into the horizontal sea. </p><p>\u201cBitch!\u201d rumbles the dragon, spinning in the air to look down on the gunslinger and Mollymauk. </p><p>Even at nearly 100 feet away, Molly can see the vindictive gleam in its predator stare. Then the beast rears its head back, a sudden sluice of sea water spilling over from draconic jaws and Molly hears Nott whisper, \u201cOh fuck, oh fuck, oh fuck \u2013!\u201d</p><p>Molly, not thinking very clearly at his point, just snarls \u201c<i>FUCK YOU</i>!\u201d with all the Infernal hate he can gather and feels a blood vessel tear open along his neck. The dragon\u2019s yellow eyes immediately blacken and run with darkness just in time for Nott to yell, \u201cDRAGONS CAN\u2019T BE BLINDED, MOLLY!\u201d and the beast unleashes a blast of tidal waters from its throat. </p><p>Time freezes for a spilt of a split of a second. Molly thinks \u2013 <i>Shit, this is exactly like the last time I used a Blood Maledict.</i>\u2013 and then the water that most certainly was meant to hit them head on like a crushing geyser\u2026 misses by about ten feet and the water slams into the wall of magical ocean to their left, bursting and frothing up against the arcane barrier and flooding the ground behind them in a massive arc up the Demali road. The water is freezing cold as it rushes back downhill, soaking Molly up to his knees and nearly knocking Nott from her footing. </p><p>The dragon is shrieking and clawing at its face. It hits the earth behind them on all fours, roaring, \u201cWHERE ARE YOU?!\u201d It thrashes its head, spitting water and screaming, \u201cYOU MEWLING IMP! I\u2019LL KILL YOU! I\u2019ll KILL YOU!\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be damned,\u201d Nott hisses, then grabs Molly and starts hauling him fast back toward the shore. \u201cRun, run, run! If it gets close, it will definitely see us! You lucky fucking bastard I can\u2019t believe that worked!\u201d</p><p>And they sprint like hell away.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s is Caduceus!?\u201d Molly yells as they run. </p><p>\u201cThat godsdamned dragon attacked him while we were sleeping!\u201d Nott, Molly notices, sounds like she\u2019s in tears. \u201cWe had to stabilize him before coming after you. I don\u2019t know if he\u2019ll be able to help us!\u201d</p><p>Behind them they can hear the monster still roaring and cursing Molly in a slew of Draconic and Common. </p><p>Then there\u2019s a thunder clap. A flash of blue light ignites the air around them. Molly\u2019s pulse skips and he spins just in time to see Yasha erupting from the sea wall like dark screaming meteorite and slam into the dragon\u2019s ribs. She\u2019s yelling. Her voice echoes down the road, blood-chilling and psychotic, as she impacts and drives her sword over and over and over into the dragon\u2019s flank like an assassin with a dagger except it\u2019s a longsword composed of black metal and lightning. </p><p>Suddenly the phrase, \u2018<i>I\u2019ve killed dragons before\u2019</i>takes on more meaning as a singular solo action.</p><p>The dragon is screaming and rearing away from the hideous one-woman onslaught. Yasha gets in two more blows, goring a massive, gushing flap of muscle open under her blade before the great drake rears up, roaring, and bats Yasha off like a cat smacking a mouse. Yasha rockets to the ground, smashing into the it. Then, before she can move from the impact zone, the giant sea dragon darts forward\u2026. and snaps its jaws down on her. Mollymauk\u2019s world goes absolutely cold around him. The dragon rips its head back and forth like a Rottweiler with a hare, brutalizing and snarling, then it hurls Yasha\u2019s broken form to the side of the road where it hits in a crumpled twist of necrotic wings and shredded armor. </p><p>There she lies still. </p><p>Molly is screaming before the deed is even done. \u201c<i>YASHA</i>!\u201d </p><p>Nott grabs his wrist top stop him the second he tries to run back. </p><p>\u201cNo! Wait, Molly! WAIT! She\u2019s in a Battle Trance! She\u2019ll be fine! Just \u2013!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t bloody believe you!\u201d Molly cries. </p><p>Nott looks stricken for just a moment, then seems to accept that. She reloads. \u201cFine. Get behind me.\u201d She kneels down in the road beside him and lines up another shot. \u201cYasha will get up. I promise.\u201d</p><p>She fires twice and the both shots detonate across the dragon\u2019s armored chest, one tearing more deeply into the wounds already inflicted by Yasha, blowing a fresh geyser of blood from the beast. But Molly isn\u2019t looking at that. He\u2019s looking at his friend who lies dead in the road, torn and broken, her skeletal wings bent like crushed origami in the mud, her arms limp and twisted around her. Molly registers despair as a rising ache inside him \u2013 new and different from all the dread and terror leading up until now. </p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll be okay,\u201d Nott says again. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, Molly. The cavalry is coming. I know it!\u201d</p><p>Molly, confused, starts to say, \u201cWho\u2019s the caval\u2013?\u201d</p><p>And then Caduceus Clay materializes at Molly\u2019s side. </p><p>Molly jumps. The cleric glances at him. His eyes are entirely composed of soft green light, burning like twin stares trapped in his skull. There is plant-life growing rapidly across his armor, moss and lichen spreading and flowering, thin ferns unfurling from chinks in the plate armor and spiraling up into his pale pink mane. He stops for just a moment to touch Mollymauk\u2019s shoulder and Molly feels an infusion of warmth through him, a light sinking into his skin like sunshine into a flower. It inhabits him completely, like someone embracing every part of him at once and Molly can\u2019t catch his breath. </p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not alone out here,\u201d says Caduceus. \u00a0</p><p>Then he turns his attention to the dragon, points his staff directly at the ground\u2026 and the earth erupts. </p><p>A shunt of living wood the length and thickness of a ship\u2019s mast slams up through the massive ribcage, spearing and driving through with such force, the creature leaves the ground and is hung momentarily impaled by a rapidly growing cedar tree. It\u2019s branches and canopy expand with unnatural speed within the chest cavity of the creature, threatening to crack the bowed bone structures out like a fist opening inside a corn husk.</p><p>\u201cNO!\u201d The dragon is screaming, writhing, still alive somehow. Blood sprays from its mouth, from its perforated ribs but still it screams, \u201cNO NO NO!\u201d </p><p>It seizes hold of the great tree beneath it in one massive claw and with an unfathomable brute strength, it tears the entire trunk into two splintery pieces. Caduceus flinches, like he felt the blow and the dragon falls to earth on four gargantuan legs. Bleeding, still speared by the head of the tree, its branches lodged inside its chest cavity, bone gleams bare along its flanks. It\u2019s missing one arm, drooling blood and sea foam. Psychotic, pain-feverish eyes turn on the three of them in the road and its gaze seems to punch through Molly\u2019s soul. </p><p>\u201cThe Leviathan,\u201d it gargles, laughing, \u201cwill have you all.\u201d </p><p>Caduceus throws out his free hand, palm out, and pink light gathers in his fingers. He whispers something and the word pulses through the ground like a tremor and instantly thousands of vines spiral up from the mud, spraying sand, and lash themselves around the dragon\u2019s limbs. But the bulk of the beast is too enormous and it pulls free of them, begins to advance up the road toward them. </p><p>\u201cThe Sea will swallow you whole!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m out of artillery!\u201d Nott fires two shots directly into the dragon\u2019s armored head, briefly knocking its skull aside before it rears back, snarling. \u201cClay!? Any other word from Melora?!\u201d </p><p>\u201cI can do something,\u201d Molly whispers. \u201cI think\u2026 I think I can try something.\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo, Molly!\u201d Nott sounds terrified. \u201cIt\u2019s a fucking dragon! You won\u2019t get lucky again!\u201d</p><p>Caduceus surprised, stares at the tiefling besides him even as an ancient dragon thunders down on them. \u201cYou\u2019re much braver than I imagined you.\u201d His soft firbolg features kind of wrinkle. Even possessed by divine fire, it makes him strangely young as he murmurs, \u201cI\u2019m sorry for all of this.\u201d</p><p>The dragon is howling, \u201cUK\u2019OTOA WILL CONSUME THE WORLD!\u201d</p><p>And Molly grips the swords, feels them sing through his palms, and easy as muscle memory he leans his shoulder back into some previously untouchable membrane, suddenly tangible against his skin. He pushes through it, like you shoulder aside a veil, and side-steps through into another dimension. Time hits him like a heavy velvet curtain, smacking into and enveloping him\u2026 then it slides off like silk and he stands free and alone. The world around burns and blurs gray and white, the edges of everything fuzzy and static \u2013 Caduceus frozen in the attitude of looking down at him, Nott crouched there in the muddy road with her weapon. </p><p>Molly turns, arcane winds rushing silent around him.</p><p>He can see the dragon. Black in the strange hyper-contrast of the realm around him, moving in slow motion, one claw raised in mid-stride, the mud spraying up around its massive footfall as it begins to spring forward at the cleric and gun-slinger before it. The world is silent, utterly soundless around him. But there\u2019s a vibration in his skull and that vibration leave a hum inside him and the hum is telling him to move, move, move.</p><p>So he moves. </p><p>He darts down the road. The water on the road separates under his boots, sprays in real-time as he touches it, then slows as he passes from contact until a thirty-foot trail of frozen sole-shaped footprints are left in the slowed waters behind him. And Molly is sprinting. Lungs burning, fast as he can, the scimitars blazing white in his fists as he reaches the dragon, still hung over him and moving so slow it may as well be holding still and he knows by instinct he has just moments. Just seconds to do this thing.</p><p>He\u2019s directly next to the dragon\u2019s left foreleg, like a black tree trunk beside him and sure as he knows how, Mollymauk swings both scimitars one after another directly into the ankle and the blades cleave through like a butcher\u2019s knife through beef. Blood sprays, slows, hangs in the air and Molly spins and swings again just one more time and this time the blow slams clear through\u2026</p><p>\u2026 and the world snaps back into color and time. </p><p>The dragon\u2019s forearm cracks in half instantly as their full weight comes down on the limb and Molly dives right just in time to narrowly avoid being crushed. The dragon hits the ground skidding on its chest, both forelegs dismembered and dragging bloody beneath it. Molly hears shrieking. Thunderous roars as he stumbles up, running toward the water wall as the road behind him is suddenly full of thrashing, screaming dragon. Maimed and howling. Molly shoves himself back again the sea wall, the ocean soaking his shirt from behind. The magic slides up his back, shivering on skin, but all he sees is the dragon. </p><p>Its tail lashes wildly, slamming into the earth near him, whipping and slicing through the water over his head, soaking Molly where he huddles, heart hammering in his throat while the giant creature surges unstoppably through its death throes. Molly knows it\u2019s dying. He knows because he can see where the branches of the tree have rammed up through the dragon\u2019s back, fully penetrating the chest when the beast fell forward, driving the stake fatally deeper with its own momentum. </p><p>\u201cMolly!\u201d Nott is yelling from somewhere, but he can\u2019t see her. \u201cMolly where are you!?\u201d</p><p>He stays frozen, pressed against the water. Anticipating the random blow that will kill him, knock him again into that black void where no memory survives. Again the tail lashes near him and he cries out, closing his eyes. \u00a0</p><p>\u201c<i>Molly</i>?!\u201d</p><p>\u201cC\u2019mon,\u201d Molly whispers, to who he\u2019s not sure, \u201cC\u2019mon. Give me a bloody break.\u201d </p><p>He feels something slam into the ground nearby, the shards of rock spraying across his cheek. He hears the dragon choking, a horrible deafening sound like all the steam going out in a forge and the gargle of blood and sea water. He smells it. Smells the blood soaking his boots in the salt water. He\u2019s past the adrenaline smooth rush where the chemical makes him instinct and on to the part where it leaves him shaking. He stands there, back against the sea, swords burning in his hand, just waiting stock still and whispering\u2026 </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you fucking dare. Don\u2019t you bloody fucking\u2026\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s silence. Silence. </p><p>Molly opens his eyes.</p><p>The dragon is dead. It\u2019s laying there, still, a gleaming black and blue mountain of armor and bloody limbs. He can\u2019t see its head from where he\u2019s standing but the great dome of its flank is still \u2013 totally empty of breath. Molly stares. His heart hammers clean in his chest, keeps beating. And for a single, shining moment Molly\u2019s just standing there with radiant fire in his fists, and there is something so fucking familiar, so goddamn innate about this that he knows it down to his veins that this body has stood over monsters before. Down to the blood in his veins he <i>knows</i>this\u2026</p><p>\u2026 and then he feels the water displace at his back and before he can react, a soaking arm hooks around his waist and a hand cased in barnacles clamps over his windpipe\u2026 and Fjord says in his ear, \u201cDon\u2019t move.\u201d</p><p>And pulls Molly back through a portal in the water. \u00a0 </p><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p><p>\u201cCAN YOU NOT?!\u201d Molly is yelling before he\u2019s even through the portal. The dimensions tear around him, a warping of reality that blinds him instantly and for a moment Molly feels his brain lock, unable to comprehend the quantum ripping around him and with a sudden violent jolt through every cell in his body, it ends. He comes to a stumbling stop, staggering, boots hitting solid ground as he jerks free the warlock gripping him. He spins away, bringing the still blazing scimitars up between them. \u201cStop fucking dragging me around! All of you! Bloody back off for a breath!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMolly,\u201d Fjord starts to say, holding up two hands, palms spread toward him. \u201cMolly. Listen to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! What the fuck are you doing?!\u201d </p><p>Molly looks wildly around, finds himself standing in\u2026 some kind of limitless space, water up to the ankles of his boots. The liquid beneath him shimmers like an oil with dark shifting reflections, seething shapes mirrored in an iridescent infinity on all sides of him. A horizon-less dark extends forever in all directions and the only point of distance at all, is Fjord, standing in front of him. There is nothing but the watery dark, Molly, and Fjord who is begging him, softly:</p><p>\u201cPlease listen.\u201d </p><p>\u201cStay away from me. Why did you bring me here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI tried to warn you. Godsdammit, I tried. I have a minute here.\u201d</p><p>Molly backs away, swords still up. \u201cNo. No bloody way. You don\u2019t get to do this too. You don\u2019t get to sweep in at the last second like a fucking \u2013!\u201d Molly sputters, panic and rage stealing all coherence for an instant. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with you? What happened? What did you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI made it too powerful, Molly. It came through the dimensions and it was gonna consume my home. I had to do something. I said it could have me if it would just stop.\u201d Fjord laughs, but it\u2019s a ragged exhausted sound. \u201cHow long has it been since it took me? Do you know, Mollymauk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA\u2026 a few years I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d </p><p>\u201cThe others tried to rescue you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. Have you seen Jester?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Molly swallows. \u201cNo one has.\u201d</p><p>Fjord nods, his eyes drifting shut, like hearing it is a relief he\u2019d been waiting on. \u201cGood,\u201d he murmurs. \u201cGood, okay.\u201d He opens his eyes again, manages this lopsided kind of grin, almost rueful. \u201cIt\u2019s really good to see you, Molly. You know that? I just\u2026 I honestly can\u2019t believe you\u2019re really here.\u201d The smile vanishes. \u201cI can\u2019t fuckin\u2019 believe this is how we meet again.\u201d</p><p>Molly hedges a moment. \u201cWe\u2019re still friends, right, Fjord?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. For what it\u2019s worth.\u201d</p><p>Molly feels bile bite the back of his throat. \u201cHow long do you have?\u201d He\u2019s shivering. \u201cHow long before your patron comes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly for a minute more. Molly, I\u2019m sorry. You died \u2018cause y\u2019all trusted me to look out for you and I didn\u2019t. I tried to do better after that. Thought I did. Saved the world and all that but now\u2026\u201d</p><p>Molly lowers his voice. \u201cI\u2019m glad my death was a such a learning experience for all of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mean it that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFjord,\u201d Molly whispers, \u201cwhy did you bring me here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t bargain with him anymore. I don\u2019t have anything left to give,\u201d Fjord says. \u201cHe wants you.\u201d</p><p>Molly\u2019s guts clench like there\u2019s a fist in them. \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust don\u2019t\u2026 don\u2019t fight it, Molly.\u201d Fjord\u2019s eyes glow yellow. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>Molly backs away, a red ache opening through him and the ache is dread, so familiar to him now it feels like he\u2019s never been without it. \u201cFjord?\u201d He gets no response, raises his voice, desperation in his throat like an Infernal reverb. \u201cFjord! Don\u2019t\u2014!\u201d</p><p>Then thing that\u2019s living in Fjord <i>looks\u00a0</i>at him. </p><p>The gaze cuts through Mollymauk like a blow. It cleaves through his head like red iron through ice, tunneling a burning hole in his psyche and Molly screams because there is literally nothing else he can do. Every muscle in his body goes taut and he nearly bites his tongue in half as an immediate grand mal seizure tears through him, but he\u2019s horribly somehow still on his feet, standing there while his body goes into a series of agonizing convulsions. He drops his weapons and they extinguish. </p><p>There\u2019s nothing except the pain. The grind of his teeth, his every muscle cramping so tight it\u2019s like they\u2019 going to snap like violin wire across his skeleton. It <i>hurts</i>. His hands are locked at his sides, fingers curled into helpless claws as his spine bends backward, his eyes rolling in his skull until he can\u2019t see anything. He\u2019s just\u2026 stuck there. Somewhere between dying and not-dying and he can\u2019t even fall down. He can\u2019t scream or speak anymore. There\u2019s just dark and heat and the muffled sound of his voice trapped in his throat. </p><p>He barely feels it when Fjord\u2019s hand settles around his windpipe and at the back of his head. </p><p>\u201cGods I\u2019m sorry,\u201d Fjord says, his voice hollow with horror. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m so sorry. Don\u2019t come back, Molly. He\u2019ll keep doing this if you don\u2019t. Just go.\u201d</p><p><i>Fuck you</i>, Molly thinks. <i>Fuck you, I don\u2019t know how this works, gods dammit\u2013</i></p><p>Fjord snaps his neck. </p><p style=\"\"><br></p><p><a href=\"http://punishandenslavesuckers.tumblr.com/post/179047961511/mollymauk-tealeaf-wakes-up-in-a-grave-by-the-road\" target=\"_blank\">go to part 7</a></p></p>",

He\u2019s secondly aware of his broken right arm which shoots a bolt of screaming heat up his wrist to his shoulder socket. For a dizzy moment there\u2019s nothing but the pain. Thirdly, he realizes he\u2019s lying in a thin layer of watery mud, silt sliding around his body about half a foot deep and soaking his clothes and hair. Water is misting cool against his face.</p><p>His vision clarifies slowly, the sound of rumbling somewhere in a muffled distance and overhead there is a thin strip of daylight nearly half a mile away, shining through the gap between the two dark walls of ocean water. Too dizzy to panic, Molly registers that he\u2019s been relocated somewhere far along the road of the Crushing Deep and he can\u2019t remember anything about how. Nothing but fangs and wind.</p><p>Molly groans and rolls over. Hissing and gritting his teeth against a myriad jolting of broken bone, abrasions and bruises. His arms are scraped, his clothes ripped, rather like he had to grapple with a cheese grater\u2026 or a dragon with thousands of sharp, armored scales that was trying to hold him in its claws. Molly\u2019s aching head suggests he fell hard enough to knock the details out of his brain, but at some point he was dropped here. </p><p>The question is for how long.</p>[[MORE]]<p>He paws at his hip. </p><p>The scimitars are there. He digs into the satchel belt Nott gave him, pulls a vial of healing potion and uncorks it with his teeth and downs it. Shudders as the heat slides across his broken and bleeding parts and knits them shut, mending calcium and marrow until his broken arm aches, but functions. He tosses the vial, tries to stand\u2026 falls back to his knees, shivering with adrenaline. His tail curls instinctively around his right thigh, a shudder sliding though him. He feverishly congratulates past Mollymauk on being paranoid enough to sleep in full gear while he surveys the dark, watery corridor around him. </p><p>He\u2019s alone. </p><p>He looks behind him \u2013 there in the far distance is the light of the shore, the size of postage stamp from afar. </p><p>He looks ahead of him \u2013 the walls of water close like an arch so no sun can penetrate from above, turning the rest of the road into a dark tunnel leading into a deep, freezing blackness. All around him, he can see shadows moving in the dark waters, like humongous fish in an aquarium\u2026 but looking nothing like any fish or beast Molly\u2019s ever seen. </p><p>\u201cOh bloody hell,\u201d Molly whispers.</p><p>He forces himself up. He can\u2019t stop shivering. He\u2019s shaking so hard his teeth are chattering, but he doesn\u2019t feel any cold, just the neutral warmth off Nott\u2019s enchanted earrings as he turns and trudges toward the shore. Every step is unsteady, shivery with adrenaline. He folds his arms around him to stop the shaking. It doesn\u2019t work. Through the raw, driving instinct to keep moving, he still has a moment of shining, hysterical clarity just long enough to think: <i>Being dead must have been less stressful than this.</i></p><p>Then Nott\u2019s voice comes bursting in his ear: \u201cMolly! Don\u2019t worry! We\u2019re coming for you! Are you okay?\u201d Then at much higher, louder volumes, \u201cYOU CAN REPLY TO THIS MESSAGE!\u201d</p><p>Molly shakes off his immediate heart-stopping terror at being yelled at via Sending. Then he hisses, \u201cI\u2019m in the Crushing Deep. I\u2019m not hurt but hurry the fuck up.\u201d He glances at the dark waters on either side of him. \u201cI don\u2019t know where that dragon went or why it dropped me.\u201d</p><p>Then, while he\u2019s counting his words to determine if he has enough to add more, a voice directly behind him says, \u201cI\u2019m right here.\u201d</p><p>Molly hasn\u2019t been in a fight for ten years technically. That doesn\u2019t stop him from spinning around and slamming his right-handed scimitar to the goddamn hilt in the speaker\u2019s gut. Blood bursts cold over his fist, dripping heavily from his knuckles, the blade humming with a terrible joy that Nott hadn\u2019t warned him about. It surges a brief warm glow through Molly\u2019s body, sliding like fingers through lines of muscle. But that warmth is nothing in the face of the cold, hollow dread.</p><p>Because the speaker still looks exactly like Yasha.</p><p>She tilts her head, glances at the blade in her stomach, then grins at Molly through bloody human teeth. </p><p>\u201cNot very smart are you? Jumping out of a dragon\u2019s claws mid-air.\u201d</p><p>Molly slams the second scimitar up in her ribcage and wrenches, gets a satisfying huff of pain from the shape-changer. </p><p>He hisses, \u201cStop wearing my friend\u2019s face!\u201d</p><p>The monster ignores Molly, ignores the blades in her belly, grabs Molly\u2019s jaw in two hands, and yanks him forward, slamming her mouth against his with such force his lip splits and blood floods him mouth as the thing with Yasha\u2019s face drags a ravenous tongue between his teeth. She kisses him vicious, catching his lip between her teeth. Molly immediately rips both blades out and carves her flanks open in gaping, bloody holes. She ignores that\u2026 but when he wrenches back, she lets him go staggering.</p><p>\u201cNone of fucking that!\u201d Molly spits blood, baring teeth. </p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t hesitate.\u201d Not-Yasha grins. \u201cI\u2019m surprised with you, dead thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not dead,\u201d Molly snaps, backing up, blades in a defensive cross. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a dead thing tethered here on thread spun by gods,\u201d says Not-Yasha. Her sides are knitting back together. \u201cThere\u2019s power in that. Power you can <i>eat</i>if you\u2019re hungry enough.\u201d She\u2019s walking toward him, forcing Molly to back away. \u201cI could eat you alive over and over. Until your gods give up on you and leave you a corpse at last.\u201d She smiles and blood floods black from her mouth. \u201cUnless they don\u2019t. We could consume you forever, Mollymauk. Imagine.\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cFuck off,\u201d</i>Molly says in Infernal to mask how gut-twisting <i>terrifying</i>that possibility is. \u201cMy friends are coming to kill you. I hear they\u2019re strong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re oh <i>so</i>fucking weak.\u201d Not-Yasha moves toward him again, slowly, unhurried. \u201cThey can\u2019t protect you. Obviously. What could I do to you before they get here? You\u2019re nothing except a thing that won\u2019t stay dead.\u201d Her hand comes up, spread toward him. \u201cBut before I take you to him\u2026 I need you to\u2013\u201c</p><p>Molly whips the scimitar across his body, blinding fast, then jumps back and to the left.</p><p>Monster-Yasha stares at the sudden bloody stump at the end of her wrist. \u201cHmm,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m going to take your guts out one at a time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho the fuck are you?\u201d Molly hisses. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cDid you really think your orc brat was the only one bound to the Great Serpent?\u201d She smiles and the smile becomes lipless, taut across the skull. \u201cYou should fall to your knees, dead thing. Your gods can\u2019t protect you here.\u201d</p><p>But before Molly can process the horrifying implications, there\u2019s a gun shot. The monster\u2019s head snaps back, a burst of red mist flowering from the skull and Not-Yasha staggers back a single step, her neck arched backward with the hit, but she does not fall. Molly jerks around just in time to see Nott, crouched in the road with a dimension door sliding shut behind her, as she lines up another shot and screams, \u201cSHEILD, MOLLY!\u201d</p><p>He activates the spell and drops to a ball with his hands over his ears. Nott fires again. She hits Not-Yasha as she starts to come back up (her body twitching horribly, splitting apart like rotten fruit peeling open\u2013) and the shot detonates. The blast is so powerful, it ignites the air and the entire road is fire and super-heated steam, the kinetic force sucked the barrier bowed around Molly\u2019s body. The air super-heats, so hot his bare skin blisters. </p><p>\u201cAGAIN! SHEILD AGAIN!\u201d</p><p>Molly brings up the other sword, activates the spell and the second wall comes up and for a split second through the smoke and steam, Molly sees something massive erupting upward in horrible jerking bursts of bone and flesh. Then she hits it with another explosive shot and this time the force is so powerful Molly is pinned flat in the mud, his shield like a bell jar on top of him, keeping out the fire. The spell sputters, flares, then dies\u2026 and the road is seemingly empty.</p><p>Molly levers himself up onto his hands and knees where he retches for a moment. His hands are sunk to the wrist in silt and fine sand, slithering sea-life writhing in the mud beneath his fingers but he\u2019s too busy hacking up a lung to notice or care. He shakes his hair out of his face, grabs for his scimitar \u2013</p><p>And that\u2019s when the ground beneath him shudders.</p><p>\u201cOh fuck,\u201d Molly manages before five massive claws burst from the sand and close over him in a gargantuan fist. Molly has just enough instinct to lunge for the largest visible gap between the thumb and forefinger before the dragon\u2019s claws snap shut around his lower body. Then he\u2019s being yanked upward with such velocity the world blurs. He sees things in wild snap shots, the water, his own forearm braced against mottle blue-white scales, the underbelly of a beast.</p><p>Pain flares through the bones in his legs and pelvis, shooting across every nerve, but he can\u2019t focus on that. Molly\u2019s moving so fucking fast he can\u2019t see, being jolted, vertigo yanking his stomach out through his throat as the ground rushes and swings wildly away. He feels the mithril chain shirt is digging through his ribs, but even so he finds enough air to scream as loud as he can:</p><p>\u201cNOTT! SHOOT IT! JUST SHOOT IT\u2014!\u201d</p><p>A bullet slams into the trunk of the dragon\u2019s arm somewhere at the elbow\u2026 then detonates. The bullet blows the entire center out of it. Then, blasted free of the main body and spraying burning cold blood, it begins to fall\u2026 with Molly still gripped in its dead hold. He tears loose, driving his boot back into the fist holding him until a giant claw comes loose, then he launches straight forward, ripping free and then he\u2019s falling free. The wind roars, tearing across his ears, the momentum ripping at his clothes and \u2013</p><p>\u201cMolly!\u201d</p><p>Yasha materializes in the air directly beneath him and he slams into her chest, solid as a wall and driving the air straight out of him, but her limbs close around and the field of her levitation seizes hold of him. Then they\u2019re rocketing backward together. Yasha wheels in reverse, downward, then spins around to right them before she comes to a messy, skidding landing in the briny mud. Their boots drag in the sludge, then they\u2019re still on the ground. </p><p>\u201cGood catch,\u201d Molly pants, untangling himself. </p><p>He looks up over his shoulder and there, wheeling in the air between the watery canyon walls, gleams the flying bulk of a massive blue-black sea dragon. Dark and serpentine, born on leathery wings and magic, its eyes gleam luminous yellow, slit up the center, and even now are fixed on Molly. The back-draft of its wings like hurricane winds, batter and tear at hair and clothes. Blood pours from the severed stump of its right arm.</p><p>He snaps his fingers and both of his lost scimitars reappear in their sheathes at his hip. As he pulls both free, he shouts over the wind, \u201cYou wanna kill that thing or what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop getting knocked around and I will,\u201d says Yasha. Her eyes flare suddenly bottle blue and burning. She flips her weapon into her hand, gripping it two handed before planting her feet and launching with such force the mud bursts away from the point of liftoff. Molly immediately races back toward Nott who is screaming something like \u201cGODS DAMMIT! WHY IS IT ALWAYS LIKE THIS?\u201d and reloading frantically. </p><p>Molly reaches her, flips his blades across the back of his neck, and drags \u2013 feels that familiar burn of metal splitting and separating skin. Radiant fire ignites along the edge, like his blood is ignition fluid and the whole blade immediately goes up in light. The rite latches onto his soul, part of his very life force living now in the swords and it\u2019s terrifying and comforting all at once. Then he\u2019s standing side-by-side with Nott the Brave and for the first time things feel familiar.</p><p>\u201cJust like old times,\u201d Molly shouts over the monstrous eldritch roaring. </p><p>\u201cTHIS IS NOTHING LIKE OLD TIMES,\u201d Nott screeches. </p><p>She fires again at the pinwheeling form of the dragon. It currently snapping its massive jaws, its enormous serpentine neck lashing back and forth at Yasha who, in the split second that it took her to move, rockets past and lumber-jack hacks her blade five feed deep into an armored shoulder. Molly feels the air shiver. There\u2019s a flash. Then a boom that shakes the sea as a massive bolt of lightning strikes the blade like a rod, conducting holy blue fire directly into bone. </p><p>The dragon <i>screams</i>. Writhes in agony, electricity crackling all across its form, then in a frenzy it grabs Yasha with its one good hand. Claws her from its shoulder. Then it throws her straight through the water wall with such force Yasha hits it like concrete, the surface bursting a geyser of impact, before she vanishes deep into the horizontal sea. </p><p>\u201cBitch!\u201d rumbles the dragon, spinning in the air to look down on the gunslinger and Mollymauk. </p><p>Even at nearly 100 feet away, Molly can see the vindictive gleam in its predator stare. Then the beast rears its head back, a sudden sluice of sea water spilling over from draconic jaws and Molly hears Nott whisper, \u201cOh fuck, oh fuck, oh fuck \u2013!\u201d</p><p>Molly, not thinking very clearly at his point, just snarls \u201c<i>FUCK YOU</i>!\u201d with all the Infernal hate he can gather and feels a blood vessel tear open along his neck. The dragon\u2019s yellow eyes immediately blacken and run with darkness just in time for Nott to yell, \u201cDRAGONS CAN\u2019T BE BLINDED, MOLLY!\u201d and the beast unleashes a blast of tidal waters from its throat. </p><p>Time freezes for a spilt of a split of a second. Molly thinks \u2013 <i>Shit, this is exactly like the last time I used a Blood Maledict.</i>\u2013 and then the water that most certainly was meant to hit them head on like a crushing geyser\u2026 misses by about ten feet and the water slams into the wall of magical ocean to their left, bursting and frothing up against the arcane barrier and flooding the ground behind them in a massive arc up the Demali road. The water is freezing cold as it rushes back downhill, soaking Molly up to his knees and nearly knocking Nott from her footing. </p><p>The dragon is shrieking and clawing at its face. It hits the earth behind them on all fours, roaring, \u201cWHERE ARE YOU?!\u201d It thrashes its head, spitting water and screaming, \u201cYOU MEWLING IMP! I\u2019LL KILL YOU! I\u2019ll KILL YOU!\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be damned,\u201d Nott hisses, then grabs Molly and starts hauling him fast back toward the shore. \u201cRun, run, run! If it gets close, it will definitely see us! You lucky fucking bastard I can\u2019t believe that worked!\u201d</p><p>And they sprint like hell away.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s is Caduceus!?\u201d Molly yells as they run. </p><p>\u201cThat godsdamned dragon attacked him while we were sleeping!\u201d Nott, Molly notices, sounds like she\u2019s in tears. \u201cWe had to stabilize him before coming after you. I don\u2019t know if he\u2019ll be able to help us!\u201d</p><p>Behind them they can hear the monster still roaring and cursing Molly in a slew of Draconic and Common. </p><p>Then there\u2019s a thunder clap. A flash of blue light ignites the air around them. Molly\u2019s pulse skips and he spins just in time to see Yasha erupting from the sea wall like dark screaming meteorite and slam into the dragon\u2019s ribs. She\u2019s yelling. Her voice echoes down the road, blood-chilling and psychotic, as she impacts and drives her sword over and over and over into the dragon\u2019s flank like an assassin with a dagger except it\u2019s a longsword composed of black metal and lightning. </p><p>Suddenly the phrase, \u2018<i>I\u2019ve killed dragons before\u2019</i>takes on more meaning as a singular solo action.</p><p>The dragon is screaming and rearing away from the hideous one-woman onslaught. Yasha gets in two more blows, goring a massive, gushing flap of muscle open under her blade before the great drake rears up, roaring, and bats Yasha off like a cat smacking a mouse. Yasha rockets to the ground, smashing into the it. Then, before she can move from the impact zone, the giant sea dragon darts forward\u2026. and snaps its jaws down on her. Mollymauk\u2019s world goes absolutely cold around him. The dragon rips its head back and forth like a Rottweiler with a hare, brutalizing and snarling, then it hurls Yasha\u2019s broken form to the side of the road where it hits in a crumpled twist of necrotic wings and shredded armor. </p><p>There she lies still. </p><p>Molly is screaming before the deed is even done. \u201c<i>YASHA</i>!\u201d </p><p>Nott grabs his wrist top stop him the second he tries to run back. </p><p>\u201cNo! Wait, Molly! WAIT! She\u2019s in a Battle Trance! She\u2019ll be fine! Just \u2013!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t bloody believe you!\u201d Molly cries. </p><p>Nott looks stricken for just a moment, then seems to accept that. She reloads. \u201cFine. Get behind me.\u201d She kneels down in the road beside him and lines up another shot. \u201cYasha will get up. I promise.\u201d</p><p>She fires twice and the both shots detonate across the dragon\u2019s armored chest, one tearing more deeply into the wounds already inflicted by Yasha, blowing a fresh geyser of blood from the beast. But Molly isn\u2019t looking at that. He\u2019s looking at his friend who lies dead in the road, torn and broken, her skeletal wings bent like crushed origami in the mud, her arms limp and twisted around her. Molly registers despair as a rising ache inside him \u2013 new and different from all the dread and terror leading up until now. </p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll be okay,\u201d Nott says again. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, Molly. The cavalry is coming. I know it!\u201d</p><p>Molly, confused, starts to say, \u201cWho\u2019s the caval\u2013?\u201d</p><p>And then Caduceus Clay materializes at Molly\u2019s side. </p><p>Molly jumps. The cleric glances at him. His eyes are entirely composed of soft green light, burning like twin stares trapped in his skull. There is plant-life growing rapidly across his armor, moss and lichen spreading and flowering, thin ferns unfurling from chinks in the plate armor and spiraling up into his pale pink mane. He stops for just a moment to touch Mollymauk\u2019s shoulder and Molly feels an infusion of warmth through him, a light sinking into his skin like sunshine into a flower. It inhabits him completely, like someone embracing every part of him at once and Molly can\u2019t catch his breath. </p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not alone out here,\u201d says Caduceus. \u00a0</p><p>Then he turns his attention to the dragon, points his staff directly at the ground\u2026 and the earth erupts. </p><p>A shunt of living wood the length and thickness of a ship\u2019s mast slams up through the massive ribcage, spearing and driving through with such force, the creature leaves the ground and is hung momentarily impaled by a rapidly growing cedar tree. It\u2019s branches and canopy expand with unnatural speed within the chest cavity of the creature, threatening to crack the bowed bone structures out like a fist opening inside a corn husk.</p><p>\u201cNO!\u201d The dragon is screaming, writhing, still alive somehow. Blood sprays from its mouth, from its perforated ribs but still it screams, \u201cNO NO NO!\u201d </p><p>It seizes hold of the great tree beneath it in one massive claw and with an unfathomable brute strength, it tears the entire trunk into two splintery pieces. Caduceus flinches, like he felt the blow and the dragon falls to earth on four gargantuan legs. Bleeding, still speared by the head of the tree, its branches lodged inside its chest cavity, bone gleams bare along its flanks. It\u2019s missing one arm, drooling blood and sea foam. Psychotic, pain-feverish eyes turn on the three of them in the road and its gaze seems to punch through Molly\u2019s soul. </p><p>\u201cThe Leviathan,\u201d it gargles, laughing, \u201cwill have you all.\u201d </p><p>Caduceus throws out his free hand, palm out, and pink light gathers in his fingers. He whispers something and the word pulses through the ground like a tremor and instantly thousands of vines spiral up from the mud, spraying sand, and lash themselves around the dragon\u2019s limbs. But the bulk of the beast is too enormous and it pulls free of them, begins to advance up the road toward them. </p><p>\u201cThe Sea will swallow you whole!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m out of artillery!\u201d Nott fires two shots directly into the dragon\u2019s armored head, briefly knocking its skull aside before it rears back, snarling. \u201cClay!? Any other word from Melora?!\u201d </p><p>\u201cI can do something,\u201d Molly whispers. \u201cI think\u2026 I think I can try something.\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo, Molly!\u201d Nott sounds terrified. \u201cIt\u2019s a fucking dragon! You won\u2019t get lucky again!\u201d</p><p>Caduceus surprised, stares at the tiefling besides him even as an ancient dragon thunders down on them. \u201cYou\u2019re much braver than I imagined you.\u201d His soft firbolg features kind of wrinkle. Even possessed by divine fire, it makes him strangely young as he murmurs, \u201cI\u2019m sorry for all of this.\u201d</p><p>The dragon is howling, \u201cUK\u2019OTOA WILL CONSUME THE WORLD!\u201d</p><p>And Molly grips the swords, feels them sing through his palms, and easy as muscle memory he leans his shoulder back into some previously untouchable membrane, suddenly tangible against his skin. He pushes through it, like you shoulder aside a veil, and side-steps through into another dimension. Time hits him like a heavy velvet curtain, smacking into and enveloping him\u2026 then it slides off like silk and he stands free and alone. The world around burns and blurs gray and white, the edges of everything fuzzy and static \u2013 Caduceus frozen in the attitude of looking down at him, Nott crouched there in the muddy road with her weapon. </p><p>Molly turns, arcane winds rushing silent around him.</p><p>He can see the dragon. Black in the strange hyper-contrast of the realm around him, moving in slow motion, one claw raised in mid-stride, the mud spraying up around its massive footfall as it begins to spring forward at the cleric and gun-slinger before it. The world is silent, utterly soundless around him. But there\u2019s a vibration in his skull and that vibration leave a hum inside him and the hum is telling him to move, move, move.</p><p>So he moves. </p><p>He darts down the road. The water on the road separates under his boots, sprays in real-time as he touches it, then slows as he passes from contact until a thirty-foot trail of frozen sole-shaped footprints are left in the slowed waters behind him. And Molly is sprinting. Lungs burning, fast as he can, the scimitars blazing white in his fists as he reaches the dragon, still hung over him and moving so slow it may as well be holding still and he knows by instinct he has just moments. Just seconds to do this thing.</p><p>He\u2019s directly next to the dragon\u2019s left foreleg, like a black tree trunk beside him and sure as he knows how, Mollymauk swings both scimitars one after another directly into the ankle and the blades cleave through like a butcher\u2019s knife through beef. Blood sprays, slows, hangs in the air and Molly spins and swings again just one more time and this time the blow slams clear through\u2026</p><p>\u2026 and the world snaps back into color and time. </p><p>The dragon\u2019s forearm cracks in half instantly as their full weight comes down on the limb and Molly dives right just in time to narrowly avoid being crushed. The dragon hits the ground skidding on its chest, both forelegs dismembered and dragging bloody beneath it. Molly hears shrieking. Thunderous roars as he stumbles up, running toward the water wall as the road behind him is suddenly full of thrashing, screaming dragon. Maimed and howling. Molly shoves himself back again the sea wall, the ocean soaking his shirt from behind. The magic slides up his back, shivering on skin, but all he sees is the dragon. </p><p>Its tail lashes wildly, slamming into the earth near him, whipping and slicing through the water over his head, soaking Molly where he huddles, heart hammering in his throat while the giant creature surges unstoppably through its death throes. Molly knows it\u2019s dying. He knows because he can see where the branches of the tree have rammed up through the dragon\u2019s back, fully penetrating the chest when the beast fell forward, driving the stake fatally deeper with its own momentum. </p><p>\u201cMolly!\u201d Nott is yelling from somewhere, but he can\u2019t see her. \u201cMolly where are you!?\u201d</p><p>He stays frozen, pressed against the water. Anticipating the random blow that will kill him, knock him again into that black void where no memory survives. Again the tail lashes near him and he cries out, closing his eyes. \u00a0</p><p>\u201c<i>Molly</i>?!\u201d</p><p>\u201cC\u2019mon,\u201d Molly whispers, to who he\u2019s not sure, \u201cC\u2019mon. Give me a bloody break.\u201d </p><p>He feels something slam into the ground nearby, the shards of rock spraying across his cheek. He hears the dragon choking, a horrible deafening sound like all the steam going out in a forge and the gargle of blood and sea water. He smells it. Smells the blood soaking his boots in the salt water. He\u2019s past the adrenaline smooth rush where the chemical makes him instinct and on to the part where it leaves him shaking. He stands there, back against the sea, swords burning in his hand, just waiting stock still and whispering\u2026 </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you fucking dare. Don\u2019t you bloody fucking\u2026\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s silence. Silence. </p><p>Molly opens his eyes.</p><p>The dragon is dead. It\u2019s laying there, still, a gleaming black and blue mountain of armor and bloody limbs. He can\u2019t see its head from where he\u2019s standing but the great dome of its flank is still \u2013 totally empty of breath. Molly stares. His heart hammers clean in his chest, keeps beating. And for a single, shining moment Molly\u2019s just standing there with radiant fire in his fists, and there is something so fucking familiar, so goddamn innate about this that he knows it down to his veins that this body has stood over monsters before. Down to the blood in his veins he <i>knows</i>this\u2026</p><p>\u2026 and then he feels the water displace at his back and before he can react, a soaking arm hooks around his waist and a hand cased in barnacles clamps over his windpipe\u2026 and Fjord says in his ear, \u201cDon\u2019t move.\u201d</p><p>And pulls Molly back through a portal in the water. \u00a0 </p><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p><p>\u201cCAN YOU NOT?!\u201d Molly is yelling before he\u2019s even through the portal. The dimensions tear around him, a warping of reality that blinds him instantly and for a moment Molly feels his brain lock, unable to comprehend the quantum ripping around him and with a sudden violent jolt through every cell in his body, it ends. He comes to a stumbling stop, staggering, boots hitting solid ground as he jerks free the warlock gripping him. He spins away, bringing the still blazing scimitars up between them. \u201cStop fucking dragging me around! All of you! Bloody back off for a breath!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMolly,\u201d Fjord starts to say, holding up two hands, palms spread toward him. \u201cMolly. Listen to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! What the fuck are you doing?!\u201d </p><p>Molly looks wildly around, finds himself standing in\u2026 some kind of limitless space, water up to the ankles of his boots. The liquid beneath him shimmers like an oil with dark shifting reflections, seething shapes mirrored in an iridescent infinity on all sides of him. A horizon-less dark extends forever in all directions and the only point of distance at all, is Fjord, standing in front of him. There is nothing but the watery dark, Molly, and Fjord who is begging him, softly:</p><p>\u201cPlease listen.\u201d </p><p>\u201cStay away from me. Why did you bring me here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI tried to warn you. Godsdammit, I tried. I have a minute here.\u201d</p><p>Molly backs away, swords still up. \u201cNo. No bloody way. You don\u2019t get to do this too. You don\u2019t get to sweep in at the last second like a fucking \u2013!\u201d Molly sputters, panic and rage stealing all coherence for an instant. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with you? What happened? What did you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI made it too powerful, Molly. It came through the dimensions and it was gonna consume my home. I had to do something. I said it could have me if it would just stop.\u201d Fjord laughs, but it\u2019s a ragged exhausted sound. \u201cHow long has it been since it took me? Do you know, Mollymauk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA\u2026 a few years I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d </p><p>\u201cThe others tried to rescue you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. Have you seen Jester?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Molly swallows. \u201cNo one has.\u201d</p><p>Fjord nods, his eyes drifting shut, like hearing it is a relief he\u2019d been waiting on. \u201cGood,\u201d he murmurs. \u201cGood, okay.\u201d He opens his eyes again, manages this lopsided kind of grin, almost rueful. \u201cIt\u2019s really good to see you, Molly. You know that? I just\u2026 I honestly can\u2019t believe you\u2019re really here.\u201d The smile vanishes. \u201cI can\u2019t fuckin\u2019 believe this is how we meet again.\u201d</p><p>Molly hedges a moment. \u201cWe\u2019re still friends, right, Fjord?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. For what it\u2019s worth.\u201d</p><p>Molly feels bile bite the back of his throat. \u201cHow long do you have?\u201d He\u2019s shivering. \u201cHow long before your patron comes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly for a minute more. Molly, I\u2019m sorry. You died \u2018cause y\u2019all trusted me to look out for you and I didn\u2019t. I tried to do better after that. Thought I did. Saved the world and all that but now\u2026\u201d</p><p>Molly lowers his voice. \u201cI\u2019m glad my death was a such a learning experience for all of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mean it that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFjord,\u201d Molly whispers, \u201cwhy did you bring me here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t bargain with him anymore. I don\u2019t have anything left to give,\u201d Fjord says. \u201cHe wants you.\u201d</p><p>Molly\u2019s guts clench like there\u2019s a fist in them. \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust don\u2019t\u2026 don\u2019t fight it, Molly.\u201d Fjord\u2019s eyes glow yellow. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>Molly backs away, a red ache opening through him and the ache is dread, so familiar to him now it feels like he\u2019s never been without it. \u201cFjord?\u201d He gets no response, raises his voice, desperation in his throat like an Infernal reverb. \u201cFjord! Don\u2019t\u2014!\u201d</p><p>Then thing that\u2019s living in Fjord <i>looks\u00a0</i>at him. </p><p>The gaze cuts through Mollymauk like a blow. It cleaves through his head like red iron through ice, tunneling a burning hole in his psyche and Molly screams because there is literally nothing else he can do. Every muscle in his body goes taut and he nearly bites his tongue in half as an immediate grand mal seizure tears through him, but he\u2019s horribly somehow still on his feet, standing there while his body goes into a series of agonizing convulsions. He drops his weapons and they extinguish. </p><p>There\u2019s nothing except the pain. The grind of his teeth, his every muscle cramping so tight it\u2019s like they\u2019 going to snap like violin wire across his skeleton. It <i>hurts</i>. His hands are locked at his sides, fingers curled into helpless claws as his spine bends backward, his eyes rolling in his skull until he can\u2019t see anything. He\u2019s just\u2026 stuck there. Somewhere between dying and not-dying and he can\u2019t even fall down. He can\u2019t scream or speak anymore. There\u2019s just dark and heat and the muffled sound of his voice trapped in his throat. </p><p>He barely feels it when Fjord\u2019s hand settles around his windpipe and at the back of his head. </p><p>\u201cGods I\u2019m sorry,\u201d Fjord says, his voice hollow with horror. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m so sorry. Don\u2019t come back, Molly. He\u2019ll keep doing this if you don\u2019t. Just go.\u201d</p><p><i>Fuck you</i>, Molly thinks. <i>Fuck you, I don\u2019t know how this works, gods dammit\u2013</i></p><p>Fjord snaps his neck. </p><p style=\"\"><br></p><p><a href=\"http://punishandenslavesuckers.tumblr.com/post/179047961511/mollymauk-tealeaf-wakes-up-in-a-grave-by-the-road\" target=\"_blank\">go to part 7</a></p></p>",

He&rsquo;s secondly aware of his broken right arm which shoots a bolt of screaming heat up his wrist to his shoulder socket. For a dizzy moment there&rsquo;s nothing but the pain. Thirdly, he realizes he&rsquo;s lying in a thin layer of watery mud, silt sliding around his body about half a foot deep and soaking his clothes and hair. Water is misting cool against his face.</p><p>His vision clarifies slowly, the sound of rumbling somewhere in a muffled distance and overhead there is a thin strip of daylight nearly half a mile away, shining through the gap between the two dark walls of ocean water. Too dizzy to panic, Molly registers that he&rsquo;s been relocated somewhere far along the road of the Crushing Deep and he can&rsquo;t remember anything about how. Nothing but fangs and wind.</p><p>Molly groans and rolls over. Hissing and gritting his teeth against a myriad jolting of broken bone, abrasions and bruises. His arms are scraped, his clothes ripped, rather like he had to grapple with a cheese grater&hellip; or a dragon with thousands of sharp, armored scales that was trying to hold him in its claws. Molly&rsquo;s aching head suggests he fell hard enough to knock the details out of his brain, but at some point he was dropped here. </p><p>The question is for how long.</p><p>He paws at his hip. </p><p>The scimitars are there. He digs into the satchel belt Nott gave him, pulls a vial of healing potion and uncorks it with his teeth and downs it. Shudders as the heat slides across his broken and bleeding parts and knits them shut, mending calcium and marrow until his broken arm aches, but functions. He tosses the vial, tries to stand&hellip; falls back to his knees, shivering with adrenaline. His tail curls instinctively around his right thigh, a shudder sliding though him. He feverishly congratulates past Mollymauk on being paranoid enough to sleep in full gear while he surveys the dark, watery corridor around him. </p><p>He&rsquo;s alone. </p><p>He looks behind him &ndash; there in the far distance is the light of the shore, the size of postage stamp from afar. </p><p>He looks ahead of him &ndash; the walls of water close like an arch so no sun can penetrate from above, turning the rest of the road into a dark tunnel leading into a deep, freezing blackness. All around him, he can see shadows moving in the dark waters, like humongous fish in an aquarium&hellip; but looking nothing like any fish or beast Molly&rsquo;s ever seen. </p><p>&ldquo;Oh bloody hell,&rdquo; Molly whispers.</p><p>He forces himself up. He can&rsquo;t stop shivering. He&rsquo;s shaking so hard his teeth are chattering, but he doesn&rsquo;t feel any cold, just the neutral warmth off Nott&rsquo;s enchanted earrings as he turns and trudges toward the shore. Every step is unsteady, shivery with adrenaline. He folds his arms around him to stop the shaking. It doesn&rsquo;t work. Through the raw, driving instinct to keep moving, he still has a moment of shining, hysterical clarity just long enough to think: <i>Being dead must have been less stressful than this.</i></p><p>Then Nott&rsquo;s voice comes bursting in his ear: &ldquo;Molly! Don&rsquo;t worry! We&rsquo;re coming for you! Are you okay?&rdquo; Then at much higher, louder volumes, &ldquo;YOU CAN REPLY TO THIS MESSAGE!&rdquo;</p><p>Molly shakes off his immediate heart-stopping terror at being yelled at via Sending. Then he hisses, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m in the Crushing Deep. I&rsquo;m not hurt but hurry the fuck up.&rdquo; He glances at the dark waters on either side of him. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know where that dragon went or why it dropped me.&rdquo;</p><p>Then, while he&rsquo;s counting his words to determine if he has enough to add more, a voice directly behind him says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m right here.&rdquo;</p><p>Molly hasn&rsquo;t been in a fight for ten years technically. That doesn&rsquo;t stop him from spinning around and slamming his right-handed scimitar to the goddamn hilt in the speaker&rsquo;s gut. Blood bursts cold over his fist, dripping heavily from his knuckles, the blade humming with a terrible joy that Nott hadn&rsquo;t warned him about. It surges a brief warm glow through Molly&rsquo;s body, sliding like fingers through lines of muscle. But that warmth is nothing in the face of the cold, hollow dread.</p><p>Because the speaker still looks exactly like Yasha.</p><p>She tilts her head, glances at the blade in her stomach, then grins at Molly through bloody human teeth. </p><p>&ldquo;Not very smart are you? Jumping out of a dragon&rsquo;s claws mid-air.&rdquo;</p><p>Molly slams the second scimitar up in her ribcage and wrenches, gets a satisfying huff of pain from the shape-changer. </p><p>He hisses, &ldquo;Stop wearing my friend&rsquo;s face!&rdquo;</p><p>The monster ignores Molly, ignores the blades in her belly, grabs Molly&rsquo;s jaw in two hands, and yanks him forward, slamming her mouth against his with such force his lip splits and blood floods him mouth as the thing with Yasha&rsquo;s face drags a ravenous tongue between his teeth. She kisses him vicious, catching his lip between her teeth. Molly immediately rips both blades out and carves her flanks open in gaping, bloody holes. She ignores that&hellip; but when he wrenches back, she lets him go staggering.</p><p>&ldquo;None of fucking that!&rdquo; Molly spits blood, baring teeth. </p><p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t hesitate.&rdquo; Not-Yasha grins. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m surprised with you, dead thing.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not dead,&rdquo; Molly snaps, backing up, blades in a defensive cross. </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a dead thing tethered here on thread spun by gods,&rdquo; says Not-Yasha. Her sides are knitting back together. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s power in that. Power you can <i>eat</i>if you&rsquo;re hungry enough.&rdquo; She&rsquo;s walking toward him, forcing Molly to back away. &ldquo;I could eat you alive over and over. Until your gods give up on you and leave you a corpse at last.&rdquo; She smiles and blood floods black from her mouth. &ldquo;Unless they don&rsquo;t. We could consume you forever, Mollymauk. Imagine.&rdquo;</p><p><i>&ldquo;Fuck off,&rdquo;</i>Molly says in Infernal to mask how gut-twisting <i>terrifying</i>that possibility is. &ldquo;My friends are coming to kill you. I hear they&rsquo;re strong.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;re oh <i>so</i>fucking weak.&rdquo; Not-Yasha moves toward him again, slowly, unhurried. &ldquo;They can&rsquo;t protect you. Obviously. What could I do to you before they get here? You&rsquo;re nothing except a thing that won&rsquo;t stay dead.&rdquo; Her hand comes up, spread toward him. &ldquo;But before I take you to him&hellip; I need you to&ndash;&ldquo;</p><p>Molly whips the scimitar across his body, blinding fast, then jumps back and to the left.</p><p>Monster-Yasha stares at the sudden bloody stump at the end of her wrist. &ldquo;Hmm,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to take your guts out one at a time.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Who the fuck are you?&rdquo; Molly hisses. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Did you really think your orc brat was the only one bound to the Great Serpent?&rdquo; She smiles and the smile becomes lipless, taut across the skull. &ldquo;You should fall to your knees, dead thing. Your gods can&rsquo;t protect you here.&rdquo;</p><p>But before Molly can process the horrifying implications, there&rsquo;s a gun shot. The monster&rsquo;s head snaps back, a burst of red mist flowering from the skull and Not-Yasha staggers back a single step, her neck arched backward with the hit, but she does not fall. Molly jerks around just in time to see Nott, crouched in the road with a dimension door sliding shut behind her, as she lines up another shot and screams, &ldquo;SHEILD, MOLLY!&rdquo;</p><p>He activates the spell and drops to a ball with his hands over his ears. Nott fires again. She hits Not-Yasha as she starts to come back up (her body twitching horribly, splitting apart like rotten fruit peeling open&ndash;) and the shot detonates. The blast is so powerful, it ignites the air and the entire road is fire and super-heated steam, the kinetic force sucked the barrier bowed around Molly&rsquo;s body. The air super-heats, so hot his bare skin blisters. </p><p>&ldquo;AGAIN! SHEILD AGAIN!&rdquo;</p><p>Molly brings up the other sword, activates the spell and the second wall comes up and for a split second through the smoke and steam, Molly sees something massive erupting upward in horrible jerking bursts of bone and flesh. Then she hits it with another explosive shot and this time the force is so powerful Molly is pinned flat in the mud, his shield like a bell jar on top of him, keeping out the fire. The spell sputters, flares, then dies&hellip; and the road is seemingly empty.</p><p>Molly levers himself up onto his hands and knees where he retches for a moment. His hands are sunk to the wrist in silt and fine sand, slithering sea-life writhing in the mud beneath his fingers but he&rsquo;s too busy hacking up a lung to notice or care. He shakes his hair out of his face, grabs for his scimitar &ndash;</p><p>And that&rsquo;s when the ground beneath him shudders.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh fuck,&rdquo; Molly manages before five massive claws burst from the sand and close over him in a gargantuan fist. Molly has just enough instinct to lunge for the largest visible gap between the thumb and forefinger before the dragon&rsquo;s claws snap shut around his lower body. Then he&rsquo;s being yanked upward with such velocity the world blurs. He sees things in wild snap shots, the water, his own forearm braced against mottle blue-white scales, the underbelly of a beast.</p><p>Pain flares through the bones in his legs and pelvis, shooting across every nerve, but he can&rsquo;t focus on that. Molly&rsquo;s moving so fucking fast he can&rsquo;t see, being jolted, vertigo yanking his stomach out through his throat as the ground rushes and swings wildly away. He feels the mithril chain shirt is digging through his ribs, but even so he finds enough air to scream as loud as he can:</p><p>&ldquo;NOTT! SHOOT IT! JUST SHOOT IT&mdash;!&rdquo;</p><p>A bullet slams into the trunk of the dragon&rsquo;s arm somewhere at the elbow&hellip; then detonates. The bullet blows the entire center out of it. Then, blasted free of the main body and spraying burning cold blood, it begins to fall&hellip; with Molly still gripped in its dead hold. He tears loose, driving his boot back into the fist holding him until a giant claw comes loose, then he launches straight forward, ripping free and then he&rsquo;s falling free. The wind roars, tearing across his ears, the momentum ripping at his clothes and &ndash;</p><p>&ldquo;Molly!&rdquo;</p><p>Yasha materializes in the air directly beneath him and he slams into her chest, solid as a wall and driving the air straight out of him, but her limbs close around and the field of her levitation seizes hold of him. Then they&rsquo;re rocketing backward together. Yasha wheels in reverse, downward, then spins around to right them before she comes to a messy, skidding landing in the briny mud. Their boots drag in the sludge, then they&rsquo;re still on the ground. </p><p>&ldquo;Good catch,&rdquo; Molly pants, untangling himself. </p><p>He looks up over his shoulder and there, wheeling in the air between the watery canyon walls, gleams the flying bulk of a massive blue-black sea dragon. Dark and serpentine, born on leathery wings and magic, its eyes gleam luminous yellow, slit up the center, and even now are fixed on Molly. The back-draft of its wings like hurricane winds, batter and tear at hair and clothes. Blood pours from the severed stump of its right arm.</p><p>He snaps his fingers and both of his lost scimitars reappear in their sheathes at his hip. As he pulls both free, he shouts over the wind, &ldquo;You wanna kill that thing or what?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Stop getting knocked around and I will,&rdquo; says Yasha. Her eyes flare suddenly bottle blue and burning. She flips her weapon into her hand, gripping it two handed before planting her feet and launching with such force the mud bursts away from the point of liftoff. Molly immediately races back toward Nott who is screaming something like &ldquo;GODS DAMMIT! WHY IS IT ALWAYS LIKE THIS?&rdquo; and reloading frantically. </p><p>Molly reaches her, flips his blades across the back of his neck, and drags &ndash; feels that familiar burn of metal splitting and separating skin. Radiant fire ignites along the edge, like his blood is ignition fluid and the whole blade immediately goes up in light. The rite latches onto his soul, part of his very life force living now in the swords and it&rsquo;s terrifying and comforting all at once. Then he&rsquo;s standing side-by-side with Nott the Brave and for the first time things feel familiar.</p><p>&ldquo;Just like old times,&rdquo; Molly shouts over the monstrous eldritch roaring. </p><p>&ldquo;THIS IS NOTHING LIKE OLD TIMES,&rdquo; Nott screeches. </p><p>She fires again at the pinwheeling form of the dragon. It currently snapping its massive jaws, its enormous serpentine neck lashing back and forth at Yasha who, in the split second that it took her to move, rockets past and lumber-jack hacks her blade five feed deep into an armored shoulder. Molly feels the air shiver. There&rsquo;s a flash. Then a boom that shakes the sea as a massive bolt of lightning strikes the blade like a rod, conducting holy blue fire directly into bone. </p><p>The dragon <i>screams</i>. Writhes in agony, electricity crackling all across its form, then in a frenzy it grabs Yasha with its one good hand. Claws her from its shoulder. Then it throws her straight through the water wall with such force Yasha hits it like concrete, the surface bursting a geyser of impact, before she vanishes deep into the horizontal sea. </p><p>&ldquo;Bitch!&rdquo; rumbles the dragon, spinning in the air to look down on the gunslinger and Mollymauk. </p><p>Even at nearly 100 feet away, Molly can see the vindictive gleam in its predator stare. Then the beast rears its head back, a sudden sluice of sea water spilling over from draconic jaws and Molly hears Nott whisper, &ldquo;Oh fuck, oh fuck, oh fuck &ndash;!&rdquo;</p><p>Molly, not thinking very clearly at his point, just snarls &ldquo;<i>FUCK YOU</i>!&rdquo; with all the Infernal hate he can gather and feels a blood vessel tear open along his neck. The dragon&rsquo;s yellow eyes immediately blacken and run with darkness just in time for Nott to yell, &ldquo;DRAGONS CAN&rsquo;T BE BLINDED, MOLLY!&rdquo; and the beast unleashes a blast of tidal waters from its throat. </p><p>Time freezes for a spilt of a split of a second. Molly thinks &ndash; <i>Shit, this is exactly like the last time I used a Blood Maledict.</i>&ndash; and then the water that most certainly was meant to hit them head on like a crushing geyser&hellip; misses by about ten feet and the water slams into the wall of magical ocean to their left, bursting and frothing up against the arcane barrier and flooding the ground behind them in a massive arc up the Demali road. The water is freezing cold as it rushes back downhill, soaking Molly up to his knees and nearly knocking Nott from her footing. </p><p>The dragon is shrieking and clawing at its face. It hits the earth behind them on all fours, roaring, &ldquo;WHERE ARE YOU?!&rdquo; It thrashes its head, spitting water and screaming, &ldquo;YOU MEWLING IMP! I&rsquo;LL KILL YOU! I&rsquo;ll KILL YOU!&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be damned,&rdquo; Nott hisses, then grabs Molly and starts hauling him fast back toward the shore. &ldquo;Run, run, run! If it gets close, it will definitely see us! You lucky fucking bastard I can&rsquo;t believe that worked!&rdquo;</p><p>And they sprint like hell away.</p><p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s is Caduceus!?&rdquo; Molly yells as they run. </p><p>&ldquo;That godsdamned dragon attacked him while we were sleeping!&rdquo; Nott, Molly notices, sounds like she&rsquo;s in tears. &ldquo;We had to stabilize him before coming after you. I don&rsquo;t know if he&rsquo;ll be able to help us!&rdquo;</p><p>Behind them they can hear the monster still roaring and cursing Molly in a slew of Draconic and Common. </p><p>Then there&rsquo;s a thunder clap. A flash of blue light ignites the air around them. Molly&rsquo;s pulse skips and he spins just in time to see Yasha erupting from the sea wall like dark screaming meteorite and slam into the dragon&rsquo;s ribs. She&rsquo;s yelling. Her voice echoes down the road, blood-chilling and psychotic, as she impacts and drives her sword over and over and over into the dragon&rsquo;s flank like an assassin with a dagger except it&rsquo;s a longsword composed of black metal and lightning. </p><p>Suddenly the phrase, &lsquo;<i>I&rsquo;ve killed dragons before&rsquo;</i>takes on more meaning as a singular solo action.</p><p>The dragon is screaming and rearing away from the hideous one-woman onslaught. Yasha gets in two more blows, goring a massive, gushing flap of muscle open under her blade before the great drake rears up, roaring, and bats Yasha off like a cat smacking a mouse. Yasha rockets to the ground, smashing into the it. Then, before she can move from the impact zone, the giant sea dragon darts forward&hellip;. and snaps its jaws down on her. Mollymauk&rsquo;s world goes absolutely cold around him. The dragon rips its head back and forth like a Rottweiler with a hare, brutalizing and snarling, then it hurls Yasha&rsquo;s broken form to the side of the road where it hits in a crumpled twist of necrotic wings and shredded armor. </p><p>There she lies still. </p><p>Molly is screaming before the deed is even done. &ldquo;<i>YASHA</i>!&rdquo; </p><p>Nott grabs his wrist top stop him the second he tries to run back. </p><p>&ldquo;No! Wait, Molly! WAIT! She&rsquo;s in a Battle Trance! She&rsquo;ll be fine! Just &ndash;!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t bloody believe you!&rdquo; Molly cries. </p><p>Nott looks stricken for just a moment, then seems to accept that. She reloads. &ldquo;Fine. Get behind me.&rdquo; She kneels down in the road beside him and lines up another shot. &ldquo;Yasha will get up. I promise.&rdquo;</p><p>She fires twice and the both shots detonate across the dragon&rsquo;s armored chest, one tearing more deeply into the wounds already inflicted by Yasha, blowing a fresh geyser of blood from the beast. But Molly isn&rsquo;t looking at that. He&rsquo;s looking at his friend who lies dead in the road, torn and broken, her skeletal wings bent like crushed origami in the mud, her arms limp and twisted around her. Molly registers despair as a rising ache inside him &ndash; new and different from all the dread and terror leading up until now. </p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll be okay,&rdquo; Nott says again. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay, Molly. The cavalry is coming. I know it!&rdquo;</p><p>Molly, confused, starts to say, &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s the caval&ndash;?&rdquo;</p><p>And then Caduceus Clay materializes at Molly&rsquo;s side. </p><p>Molly jumps. The cleric glances at him. His eyes are entirely composed of soft green light, burning like twin stares trapped in his skull. There is plant-life growing rapidly across his armor, moss and lichen spreading and flowering, thin ferns unfurling from chinks in the plate armor and spiraling up into his pale pink mane. He stops for just a moment to touch Mollymauk&rsquo;s shoulder and Molly feels an infusion of warmth through him, a light sinking into his skin like sunshine into a flower. It inhabits him completely, like someone embracing every part of him at once and Molly can&rsquo;t catch his breath. </p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not alone out here,&rdquo; says Caduceus. &nbsp;</p><p>Then he turns his attention to the dragon, points his staff directly at the ground&hellip; and the earth erupts. </p><p>A shunt of living wood the length and thickness of a ship&rsquo;s mast slams up through the massive ribcage, spearing and driving through with such force, the creature leaves the ground and is hung momentarily impaled by a rapidly growing cedar tree. It&rsquo;s branches and canopy expand with unnatural speed within the chest cavity of the creature, threatening to crack the bowed bone structures out like a fist opening inside a corn husk.</p><p>&ldquo;NO!&rdquo; The dragon is screaming, writhing, still alive somehow. Blood sprays from its mouth, from its perforated ribs but still it screams, &ldquo;NO NO NO!&rdquo; </p><p>It seizes hold of the great tree beneath it in one massive claw and with an unfathomable brute strength, it tears the entire trunk into two splintery pieces. Caduceus flinches, like he felt the blow and the dragon falls to earth on four gargantuan legs. Bleeding, still speared by the head of the tree, its branches lodged inside its chest cavity, bone gleams bare along its flanks. It&rsquo;s missing one arm, drooling blood and sea foam. Psychotic, pain-feverish eyes turn on the three of them in the road and its gaze seems to punch through Molly&rsquo;s soul. </p><p>&ldquo;The Leviathan,&rdquo; it gargles, laughing, &ldquo;will have you all.&rdquo; </p><p>Caduceus throws out his free hand, palm out, and pink light gathers in his fingers. He whispers something and the word pulses through the ground like a tremor and instantly thousands of vines spiral up from the mud, spraying sand, and lash themselves around the dragon&rsquo;s limbs. But the bulk of the beast is too enormous and it pulls free of them, begins to advance up the road toward them. </p><p>&ldquo;The Sea will swallow you whole!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m out of artillery!&rdquo; Nott fires two shots directly into the dragon&rsquo;s armored head, briefly knocking its skull aside before it rears back, snarling. &ldquo;Clay!? Any other word from Melora?!&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I can do something,&rdquo; Molly whispers. &ldquo;I think&hellip; I think I can try something.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;No, Molly!&rdquo; Nott sounds terrified. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a fucking dragon! You won&rsquo;t get lucky again!&rdquo;</p><p>Caduceus surprised, stares at the tiefling besides him even as an ancient dragon thunders down on them. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re much braver than I imagined you.&rdquo; His soft firbolg features kind of wrinkle. Even possessed by divine fire, it makes him strangely young as he murmurs, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry for all of this.&rdquo;</p><p>The dragon is howling, &ldquo;UK&rsquo;OTOA WILL CONSUME THE WORLD!&rdquo;</p><p>And Molly grips the swords, feels them sing through his palms, and easy as muscle memory he leans his shoulder back into some previously untouchable membrane, suddenly tangible against his skin. He pushes through it, like you shoulder aside a veil, and side-steps through into another dimension. Time hits him like a heavy velvet curtain, smacking into and enveloping him&hellip; then it slides off like silk and he stands free and alone. The world around burns and blurs gray and white, the edges of everything fuzzy and static &ndash; Caduceus frozen in the attitude of looking down at him, Nott crouched there in the muddy road with her weapon. </p><p>Molly turns, arcane winds rushing silent around him.</p><p>He can see the dragon. Black in the strange hyper-contrast of the realm around him, moving in slow motion, one claw raised in mid-stride, the mud spraying up around its massive footfall as it begins to spring forward at the cleric and gun-slinger before it. The world is silent, utterly soundless around him. But there&rsquo;s a vibration in his skull and that vibration leave a hum inside him and the hum is telling him to move, move, move.</p><p>So he moves. </p><p>He darts down the road. The water on the road separates under his boots, sprays in real-time as he touches it, then slows as he passes from contact until a thirty-foot trail of frozen sole-shaped footprints are left in the slowed waters behind him. And Molly is sprinting. Lungs burning, fast as he can, the scimitars blazing white in his fists as he reaches the dragon, still hung over him and moving so slow it may as well be holding still and he knows by instinct he has just moments. Just seconds to do this thing.</p><p>He&rsquo;s directly next to the dragon&rsquo;s left foreleg, like a black tree trunk beside him and sure as he knows how, Mollymauk swings both scimitars one after another directly into the ankle and the blades cleave through like a butcher&rsquo;s knife through beef. Blood sprays, slows, hangs in the air and Molly spins and swings again just one more time and this time the blow slams clear through&hellip;</p><p>&hellip; and the world snaps back into color and time. </p><p>The dragon&rsquo;s forearm cracks in half instantly as their full weight comes down on the limb and Molly dives right just in time to narrowly avoid being crushed. The dragon hits the ground skidding on its chest, both forelegs dismembered and dragging bloody beneath it. Molly hears shrieking. Thunderous roars as he stumbles up, running toward the water wall as the road behind him is suddenly full of thrashing, screaming dragon. Maimed and howling. Molly shoves himself back again the sea wall, the ocean soaking his shirt from behind. The magic slides up his back, shivering on skin, but all he sees is the dragon. </p><p>Its tail lashes wildly, slamming into the earth near him, whipping and slicing through the water over his head, soaking Molly where he huddles, heart hammering in his throat while the giant creature surges unstoppably through its death throes. Molly knows it&rsquo;s dying. He knows because he can see where the branches of the tree have rammed up through the dragon&rsquo;s back, fully penetrating the chest when the beast fell forward, driving the stake fatally deeper with its own momentum. </p><p>&ldquo;Molly!&rdquo; Nott is yelling from somewhere, but he can&rsquo;t see her. &ldquo;Molly where are you!?&rdquo;</p><p>He stays frozen, pressed against the water. Anticipating the random blow that will kill him, knock him again into that black void where no memory survives. Again the tail lashes near him and he cries out, closing his eyes. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Molly</i>?!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;C&rsquo;mon,&rdquo; Molly whispers, to who he&rsquo;s not sure, &ldquo;C&rsquo;mon. Give me a bloody break.&rdquo; </p><p>He feels something slam into the ground nearby, the shards of rock spraying across his cheek. He hears the dragon choking, a horrible deafening sound like all the steam going out in a forge and the gargle of blood and sea water. He smells it. Smells the blood soaking his boots in the salt water. He&rsquo;s past the adrenaline smooth rush where the chemical makes him instinct and on to the part where it leaves him shaking. He stands there, back against the sea, swords burning in his hand, just waiting stock still and whispering&hellip; </p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you fucking dare. Don&rsquo;t you bloody fucking&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>There&rsquo;s silence. Silence. </p><p>Molly opens his eyes.</p><p>The dragon is dead. It&rsquo;s laying there, still, a gleaming black and blue mountain of armor and bloody limbs. He can&rsquo;t see its head from where he&rsquo;s standing but the great dome of its flank is still &ndash; totally empty of breath. Molly stares. His heart hammers clean in his chest, keeps beating. And for a single, shining moment Molly&rsquo;s just standing there with radiant fire in his fists, and there is something so fucking familiar, so goddamn innate about this that he knows it down to his veins that this body has stood over monsters before. Down to the blood in his veins he <i>knows</i>this&hellip;</p><p>&hellip; and then he feels the water displace at his back and before he can react, a soaking arm hooks around his waist and a hand cased in barnacles clamps over his windpipe&hellip; and Fjord says in his ear, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t move.&rdquo;</p><p>And pulls Molly back through a portal in the water. &nbsp; </p><p><br /></p><hr /><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;CAN YOU NOT?!&rdquo; Molly is yelling before he&rsquo;s even through the portal. The dimensions tear around him, a warping of reality that blinds him instantly and for a moment Molly feels his brain lock, unable to comprehend the quantum ripping around him and with a sudden violent jolt through every cell in his body, it ends. He comes to a stumbling stop, staggering, boots hitting solid ground as he jerks free the warlock gripping him. He spins away, bringing the still blazing scimitars up between them. &ldquo;Stop fucking dragging me around! All of you! Bloody back off for a breath!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Molly,&rdquo; Fjord starts to say, holding up two hands, palms spread toward him. &ldquo;Molly. Listen to me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No! What the fuck are you doing?!&rdquo; </p><p>Molly looks wildly around, finds himself standing in&hellip; some kind of limitless space, water up to the ankles of his boots. The liquid beneath him shimmers like an oil with dark shifting reflections, seething shapes mirrored in an iridescent infinity on all sides of him. A horizon-less dark extends forever in all directions and the only point of distance at all, is Fjord, standing in front of him. There is nothing but the watery dark, Molly, and Fjord who is begging him, softly:</p><p>&ldquo;Please listen.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Stay away from me. Why did you bring me here?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I tried to warn you. Godsdammit, I tried. I have a minute here.&rdquo;</p><p>Molly backs away, swords still up. &ldquo;No. No bloody way. You don&rsquo;t get to do this too. You don&rsquo;t get to sweep in at the last second like a fucking &ndash;!&rdquo; Molly sputters, panic and rage stealing all coherence for an instant. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with you? What happened? What did you do?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I made it too powerful, Molly. It came through the dimensions and it was gonna consume my home. I had to do something. I said it could have me if it would just stop.&rdquo; Fjord laughs, but it&rsquo;s a ragged exhausted sound. &ldquo;How long has it been since it took me? Do you know, Mollymauk?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A&hellip; a few years I think.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;The others tried to rescue you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know. Have you seen Jester?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; Molly swallows. &ldquo;No one has.&rdquo;</p><p>Fjord nods, his eyes drifting shut, like hearing it is a relief he&rsquo;d been waiting on. &ldquo;Good,&rdquo; he murmurs. &ldquo;Good, okay.&rdquo; He opens his eyes again, manages this lopsided kind of grin, almost rueful. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s really good to see you, Molly. You know that? I just&hellip; I honestly can&rsquo;t believe you&rsquo;re really here.&rdquo; The smile vanishes. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t fuckin&rsquo; believe this is how we meet again.&rdquo;</p><p>Molly hedges a moment. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re still friends, right, Fjord?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes. For what it&rsquo;s worth.&rdquo;</p><p>Molly feels bile bite the back of his throat. &ldquo;How long do you have?&rdquo; He&rsquo;s shivering. &ldquo;How long before your patron comes?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Only for a minute more. Molly, I&rsquo;m sorry. You died &lsquo;cause y&rsquo;all trusted me to look out for you and I didn&rsquo;t. I tried to do better after that. Thought I did. Saved the world and all that but now&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Molly lowers his voice. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad my death was a such a learning experience for all of you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean it that way.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Fjord,&rdquo; Molly whispers, &ldquo;why did you bring me here?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t bargain with him anymore. I don&rsquo;t have anything left to give,&rdquo; Fjord says. &ldquo;He wants you.&rdquo;</p><p>Molly&rsquo;s guts clench like there&rsquo;s a fist in them. &ldquo;What does that mean?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Just don&rsquo;t&hellip; don&rsquo;t fight it, Molly.&rdquo; Fjord&rsquo;s eyes glow yellow. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry.&rdquo;</p><p>Molly backs away, a red ache opening through him and the ache is dread, so familiar to him now it feels like he&rsquo;s never been without it. &ldquo;Fjord?&rdquo; He gets no response, raises his voice, desperation in his throat like an Infernal reverb. &ldquo;Fjord! Don&rsquo;t&mdash;!&rdquo;</p><p>Then thing that&rsquo;s living in Fjord <i>looks&nbsp;</i>at him. </p><p>The gaze cuts through Mollymauk like a blow. It cleaves through his head like red iron through ice, tunneling a burning hole in his psyche and Molly screams because there is literally nothing else he can do. Every muscle in his body goes taut and he nearly bites his tongue in half as an immediate grand mal seizure tears through him, but he&rsquo;s horribly somehow still on his feet, standing there while his body goes into a series of agonizing convulsions. He drops his weapons and they extinguish. </p><p>There&rsquo;s nothing except the pain. The grind of his teeth, his every muscle cramping so tight it&rsquo;s like they&rsquo; going to snap like violin wire across his skeleton. It <i>hurts</i>. His hands are locked at his sides, fingers curled into helpless claws as his spine bends backward, his eyes rolling in his skull until he can&rsquo;t see anything. He&rsquo;s just&hellip; stuck there. Somewhere between dying and not-dying and he can&rsquo;t even fall down. He can&rsquo;t scream or speak anymore. There&rsquo;s just dark and heat and the muffled sound of his voice trapped in his throat. </p><p>He barely feels it when Fjord&rsquo;s hand settles around his windpipe and at the back of his head. </p><p>&ldquo;Gods I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; Fjord says, his voice hollow with horror. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, I&rsquo;m so sorry. Don&rsquo;t come back, Molly. He&rsquo;ll keep doing this if you don&rsquo;t. Just go.&rdquo;</p><p><i>Fuck you</i>, Molly thinks. <i>Fuck you, I don&rsquo;t know how this works, gods dammit&ndash;</i></p><p>Fjord snaps his neck. </p><p><br /></p><p><a href=\"http://punishandenslavesuckers.tumblr.com/post/179047961511/mollymauk-tealeaf-wakes-up-in-a-grave-by-the-road\" target=\"_blank\">go to part 7</a></p></p>",

He&rsquo;s secondly aware of his broken right arm which shoots a bolt of screaming heat up his wrist to his shoulder socket. For a dizzy moment there&rsquo;s nothing but the pain. Thirdly, he realizes he&rsquo;s lying in a thin layer of watery mud, silt sliding around his body about half a foot deep and soaking his clothes and hair. Water is misting cool against his face.</p>\n<p>His vision clarifies slowly, the sound of rumbling somewhere in a muffled distance and overhead there is a thin strip of daylight nearly half a mile away, shining through the gap between the two dark walls of ocean water. Too dizzy to panic, Molly registers that he&rsquo;s been relocated somewhere far along the road of the Crushing Deep and he can&rsquo;t remember anything about how. Nothing but fangs and wind.</p>\n<p>Molly groans and rolls over. Hissing and gritting his teeth against a myriad jolting of broken bone, abrasions and bruises. His arms are scraped, his clothes ripped, rather like he had to grapple with a cheese grater&hellip; or a dragon with thousands of sharp, armored scales that was trying to hold him in its claws. Molly&rsquo;s aching head suggests he fell hard enough to knock the details out of his brain, but at some point he was dropped here. </p>\n<p>The question is for how long.</p>\n</p>",
