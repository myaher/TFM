        "body": "<p>Hi ya\u2019ll, I don\u2019t often make personal posts but my mother and I are struggling real hard. We can\u2019t afford any of her meds and she\u2019s getting real sick from it. Also as a side affect from that, I can\u2019t receive any mental health or physical health care either as all funds go directly to my mother (and I\u2019m glad it does, but we both need it). I need treatment for my IBS and spinal injury and money for transition. Here\u2019s what I wrote in the actual thing but if anybody could give anything it would be real appreciated. The link is below. (ps I\u2019m definitely gonna spam tags so sorry about that) (also ps please reblog if you\u2019re a larger blog it would really help). </p><p><i>Hello! I (Dante) am raising money to help my mother with the mountains of medications she should be having but can\u2019t due to lack of funds. She has a multitude of conditions, including but not limited to Crohn\u2019s disease, rheumatoid arthritis, PCOS, endometriosis, hypertension and ankylosing spondylitis. She has been suffering with these conditions for many years now and her health is rapidly declining. She cannot work because of these and I am trying to find work while also being disabled myself and going to university.</i></p><p><i>Due to the fact that at the current moment, we can\u2019t even afford fees for specialist appointments, I cannot estimate what all of the medications she needs would cost. Some popular drugs that can be used to treat Crohn\u2019s disease, rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis are Humira \u00a0and Remicade. They are both injections and are both $40 aud for JUST ONE SHOT. Even with the health care we have. Plus this will only help some of her conditions, not all of them. She needs them soon as I can tell that day by day she is getting a little bit worse.</i></p><p><i>This medication could give my mother the life she didn\u2019t have and could allow her to live it longer. To do the things that her illnesses have stopped her from doing. Any donations are welcome and are greatly appreciated. Even if it\u2019s only some, it\u2019ll help. Thank you for reading.</i></p><p><a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gofundme.com%2Fprolonging-a-life%26rcid%3Dr01-155170472038-8cfc018d8bb547ce%26pc%3Dot_co_campmgmt_w&amp;t=Zjk4OGE3ZTllYWU4NTc2MTYxMTVlMjk5MjBkNmUzNWM3NjJmMDUwMCw0ZjZlVmNWdw%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AWZJeR26bMOWC2BUZLIvYVA&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Feh-papi.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F183214222131%2Fplease-help-my-mother&amp;m=1\">https://www.gofundme.com/prolonging-a-life&amp;rcid=r01-155170472038-8cfc018d8bb547ce&amp;pc=ot_co_campmgmt_w</a></p>",
