Well, that and Guardians of the Galaxy 3. I will never forgive Taika Waititi for Ragnarok so if you liked that sorry excuse for a movie, I suggest you get off my blog. I\u2019m always angry About something and currently it\u2019s over the fact that Loki is getting his own show when there are so many other more interesting characters with untapped potential for expansion. </p>",

I don\u2019t care if you  were bitter about the fact that your show was canceled. The fact of the matter was that Peggy was treated a LOT better than most female characters in the MCU. Case in point, Jaime Alexander. She was unceremoniously written out of Thor: Ragnarok without so much as a name drop. She didn\u2019t get to appear in Infinity War or Endgame, and the only mention of her character since her appearance on AoS is her dusted status on the Mcu wiki. And yet she NEVER felt the need to badmouth Tessa Thompson/ Valkyrie for \u201cmaking a move on her man\u201d or \u201creplacing her\u201d. And unlike you, Jaime NEVER got her own show on Netflix, appeared in as many movies as you, or was made the founder of S.H.I.E.L.D.</p><p> So really, you have no excuse for refusing to condemn the fans who were harassing Emily in the name of \u201cPeggy\u2019s legacy\u201d and the comments you made that bolstered them into petitioning Emily\u2019s removal from the MCU played a role in sidelining an up-and-coming actress from what would otherwise have been her big break in the MCU, whether that was your intention or not. </p><p>In short, fuck you, Hayley Atwell. You\u2019re a shitty, excuse for a \u201cfeminist\u201d and I hope you aren\u2019t allowed anywhere near Falcon and the Winter Soldier. In fact I\u2019d be happy if you never appeared in the mcu after this at all. </p>",

I think who often people forgotten to consider that when they call a character or another OOC in the part of Endgame in 2023. </p><p>Bruce/Hulk: Bruce had a very hard life earlier and a very bad relationship with his other half aka Hulk, believing who he was a monster. During the five years gap he decided to work on reconcile himself with Hulk and become only one person instead of two sharing the same body.  In 2023 The new Hulk is a well know and beloved hero </p><p>Tony/Iron Man: in a very fitting way for his character the five years of the gap are most likely the best of his life. Tony is the Avenger who has lost less in the snap (because all his closest circle is still alive). He married Pepper, become father and lived happily away from the world. Only the reemergence of the guilt for Perer\u2019s death (who was well buried and forgotten in his happiness) convince him to help the others with the time heist (and without Morgan his sacrifice in his last moment would never happen). </p><p>Clint/Hawkeye: Clint is the one who lost everything: his beloved wife and their three children all disappeared before his eyes. Maybe if he had not lost all his family he would be able to stay sane, but losing them all was the opening of the hell for him so he decided to go to kill the people who do not deserved to live because they were criminal bosses (maybe hoping to die at some point during this self-assigned mission). Still when Natasha reach him, tell him who they have a chance to bring everyone back he is healed, focused, regret his action and become the most determined Avengers in their mission. He will likely never forgive himself for not being able to prevent Natasha\u2019s death but will be aleays grateful to her for everything (specially her sacrifice to allow him to return to his family).</p><p>Natasha: she lost most of the people she loved in the snap, plus Clint (her best friend and almost brother) to the darkness of his grief. She was grieving and destroyed and unable to move on from that loss and decided to dedicate her life to keep safe what remained of the world (and universe). She and Steve are clearly each other emotional support and she is truly worried for Clint. Natasha would do anything for returning the people lost in the snap and still felt guilty for her actions before joining the SHIELD. Plus losing Clint, Steve or any of her actual co-workers would be likely too much for her&hellip;</p><p>Steve: losing his world and friends once was hard, losing it twice was destructive. Again he lost practically all his inner circle (Bucky, Sam, Wanda, T\u2019Challa, Sharon to the snap plus Clint and Thor to their own darkness). Still he tried to go on, helping people but he was go ahead on autopilot. In this situation, with only Natasha to keep him grounded to this reality, the memory of his great lost love and of the first group of friend he lost started to re-emerge and the grief for their loss mixed with the grief for the more recent losses. At the moment of the time heist he is barely holding himself and Natasha\u2019s death is truly the last straw for him. He fought for saving his new world and stopping Thanos once-for-all but was really ready to die and too broken for living there after the battle.</p><p>Thor: he is the one who has lost the most in the latest years. In order: his mother, his relationship with Jane, his father, his friends, his father, many of his people to the hand of his sister, his world, then his adopted brother and his friend and mentor Heimdall plus half of the survivors of his people to the hand of Thanos. After all this he had the chance to kill Thanos, preventing the snap and failed. Around half of the remaining Asgardians again was killed by the snap, then they found Thanos, discovered he had destroyed the gem and this time Thor killed him, an useless kill who was the final straw for him. Thor felt to be a total failure and to be good only to bring doom to his people and his loved ones so he decide to isolate himself. He see beers, tv and videogames as the best way for use his time in New Asgard. Likely Korg and Miek are the only people he want around because they do not try to rescue him from his state unlike Valkyrie and the Avengers well they do not need to know what he is doing&hellip; Only after meeting his mother in Asgard and borrowing Mjolnir from there he returned himself but is still to broken (and maybe ashamed) for remaining with his people who in his mind deserve (and already have) a better leader than him in Valkyrie </p>",
