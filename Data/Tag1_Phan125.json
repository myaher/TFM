        "answer": "<p>I agree that people are much more hesitant to talk about Dan\u2019s family openly and fan over them the way they do Phil\u2019s family because Phil\u2019s family is more public and I think it\u2019s good that there is an attempt to respect Dan\u2019s family, who are younger and out there still living their lives with jobs and school and stuff, in that way. However, when people do talk about Dan\u2019s family, I have often seen them do it in a negative way and I do think that\u2019s worse in a lot of ways because then you don\u2019t have the opportunity for people to strike down the things they are saying in the way you would see if someone was saying negative things more publicly. I\u2019m hesitant to even go into some of the things I\u2019ve heard people say over the years because I don\u2019t want to contribute to putting that crap on the internet any more than it already is, but to just focus on Adrian, I think people are afraid of how to approach the topic of him with Dan, but I don\u2019t see the caution when it comes with how they talk about or interact with Adrian himself. I have seen many examples over the past couple of months where people would say negative things about Adrian, but then also express fear over themselves or anyone in the phandom talking about him out loud and it\u2019s not hard to gather that it\u2019s because they are afraid of Dan being upset with the phandom for treating his family poorly, not because they have respect for them. I personally think the problem is that because Dan\u2019s family has been more private, the phandom has made up roles for them using dramatic headcannon in this narrative that it collectively created and want Dan and Phil\u2019s lives to follow and therefore would rather them remain hidden and silent in order to avoid the cognitive dissonance caused by the reality of who they are and their relationships with Dan interfering with the fantasy. The more they do exist publicly and cause these issues, like Adrian is doing now, the less the phandom likes it and we are left with the underlying anger. That\u2019s my opinion. </p>",

However, when people do talk about Dan\u2019s family, I have often seen them do it in a negative way and I do think that\u2019s worse in a lot of ways because then you don\u2019t have the opportunity for people to strike down the things they are saying in the way you would see if someone was saying negative things more publicly. I\u2019m hesitant to even go into some of the things I\u2019ve heard people say over the years because I don\u2019t want to contribute to putting that crap on the internet any more than it already is, but to just focus on Adrian, I think people are afraid of how to approach the topic of him with Dan, but I don\u2019t see the caution when it comes with how they talk about or interact with Adrian himself. I have seen many examples over the past couple of months where people would say negative things about Adrian, but then also express fear over themselves or anyone in the phandom talking about him out loud and it\u2019s not hard to gather that it\u2019s because they are afraid of Dan being upset with the phandom for treating his family poorly, not because they have respect for them. I personally think the problem is that because Dan\u2019s family has been more private, the phandom has made up roles for them using dramatic headcannon in this narrative that it collectively created and want Dan and Phil\u2019s lives to follow and therefore would rather them remain hidden and silent in order to avoid the cognitive dissonance caused by the reality of who they are and their relationships with Dan interfering with the fantasy. The more they do exist publicly and cause these issues, like Adrian is doing now, the less the phandom likes it and we are left with the underlying anger. That\u2019s my opinion. </p>",
