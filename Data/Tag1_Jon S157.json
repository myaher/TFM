I hope you like them!!</p><p>Literally anything by <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mE7jDx97OHCEZIUGQNIq5_w\" target=\"_blank\">@muttpeeta</a>. Everyone reading this is rolling their eyes because they saw it coming since I am a weird Amy fangirl and she is my favorite Jonerys fic writer :\u2019) The first thing I ever read by her was <a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Farchiveofourown.org%2Fworks%2F12033762%2Fchapters%2F27242637&amp;t=MGU0OTRkZjI1NmMyYmQxYzg1OTg5MzVjMGQ4Y2M1MTRjMmExYjI4MCwzMTRkYTQ5ZDc1MGY3NmUyYWNhNjZhYjJiYTY5N2E2ZWM3MTlmODU2\" target=\"_blank\">The \u201cBittersweet Between My Teeth\u201d</a> so I\u2019m biased toward and it\u2019s one of my faves.

Premise is Dany growing up as a ward at Winterfell, betrothed to Robb, but falling in love with Jon instead. READ THE THING!

Once the parentage reveal happens, coupled with perhaps D*ny figuring out that Jon never loved her and was manipulating her as well as the antagonism of the North and the rest of Westeros against her claim, D*ny will see Jon as her ultimate enemy, by virtue of the fact that most of Westeros will band together behind him and not her. She called him her enemy in their first meeting and only changed her mind because of a faux-bent knee and <strike>coerced</strike> sex. I think she\u2019ll go back to that rather quickly.

It\u2019s going to need leadership and it\u2019s going to need it asap. I\u2019ve already detailed in my other post why Jon and Sansa are the natural choice, by virtue of all of the alliances they can make across the board as well as their involvement in the War for the Dawn. I agree with you and I think their allies will put pressure on them to assume the crown because Westeros will need to band together to get over this cataclysmic event and the two of them are the only leaders that most of the people of Westeros can agree to actually want ruling them.\u00a0</p><p class=\"npf_quote\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"quote\"}'>Someday your husband will sit there and you will sit by his side, and one day before too long you\u2019ll present your son to the court.

As far as we know Elia is still alive and imprisoned.  She has a tenuous allegiance with Dany but that's it. Dany has done nothing to come to her aid.

Sure Jon was born in Dorne but he\u2019s a Northerner. He has no allegiance to them.\n\n<br/></p></blockquote><p>Hey, nonnie.</p><p>I\u2019ve been thinking a lot about this. Yesterday, in the comments section of my D*ny/Cersei <a href=\"https://fortunatelylori.tumblr.com/post/182193534051/do-you-think-it-means-anything-that-the-tarlys\">comparison post\u00a0</a>, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m9retLEdxQobBr_YU7YB92A\">@blurredblue</a> mentioned that Cersei\u2019s real weakness at this time is that she has no allies left in Westeros. And that got me thinking \u2026 That\u2019s essentially D*ny\u2019s problem as well.\u00a0</p><p>They sort of canceled each other out in season 7 on that front when Cersei took all of D*ny\u2019s allies out of play, thus leaving her without legitimacy in terms of launching her campaign. D*ny returned the favor by burning the Tarlys alive, and leaving Cersei without her only true Westerosi ally.\u00a0</p><p>But the burning of the Tarlys was also D*ny shooting herself in the foot because, his crappy parental treatment of his eldest son aside, Randall Tarly was a well respected member of the Westerosi aristocracy with a great military record. Not only that but by burning them alive without a trial and the legitimacy of a crown, D*ny committed a war crime by the laws established in this universe. As we remember from Robb\u2019s campaign, it\u2019s actually not ok or acceptable to kill prisoners of war in Westeros.\u00a0</p><p>But D*ny\u2019s biggest mistake to date is not that. The more I think of it the more I realize that in terms of strategy and diplomacy, her biggest mistake was her treatment of Jon Snow, aka The King in the North. Obviously all of this is predicated on the existence of political Jon in one form or another, which by and large has become, in my mind, the key GOT theory on which the entire Game of Thrones now rests. So for the remainder of this post, we will assume that in fact Jon\u2019s actions in season 7 were politically motivated and that he is not a Northern Fool/cinnamon roll who fell in love with the Mother of Dragons and is ready to give up everything for her, like countless less important male character before him.\u00a0</p><p>The reason why I say that D*ny\u2019s biggest mistake was her treatment of Jon is because, right now, House Stark is THE HOUSE you need in order to control Westeros. Dragons will only get you so far. You need alliances in order to establish a peaceful and successful rule and while everyone is bleeding allies left and right, House Stark, through Jon and Sansa, is racking in the numbers. If she had not been so greedy, if she weren\u2019t hell bent on dominance and submission of anyone she encounters, D*ny would have had a fantastic opportunity to enter a mutually beneficial alliance with House Stark, one established on collaboration not coercion. By dismissing Jon, demoting him, proving herself a fickle ally who is more likely to burn you alive than treat with you, by not entertaining the very pertinent reasons why the North is seeking its independence, she blew her chance at that alliance.</p><!-- more --><p>Tyrion, by the way, must share a part in this debacle because he tricks Jon into coming to Dragonstone, is as adamant about Jon bending the knee as D*ny is, albeit in a more diplomatic way and he fails to do his proper research in advance. He thinks Jon is the gullible King in the North and the North is an ally worth having, particularly once their other allies are wiped out, but he doesn\u2019t seem to understand that whoever holds the allegiance of House Stark will in fact hold the geopolitical hegemony over Westeros.\u00a0</p><p>Let\u2019s break it down:\u00a0</p><p>We\u2019ll start with Jon, since he is the titular leader of House Stark, despite his status as a bastard. In season 7, Sansa mentions that the Northern Lords are loyal, by and large, to Jon. We see Lord Glover and Lord Royce of the Vale mention that perhaps they should have elected Sansa as their Queen but the rest of the lords do not join in this conversation. They are, for the moment, holding fast behind their decision to elect Jon as King. Of course, strife is coming because of Jon\u2019s decision to bend the knee but considering that Sansa will most likely support him in front of the Great Council, the Northern Lords will probably stick around. Also, Jon has the Wildlings undivided loyalty.\u00a0</p><p>People could be excused in ignoring the Wildlings since they\u2019re a small group and one that has been brought South of the Wall only recently but the fact of the matter is they\u2019re here now and they\u2019re staying put. On top of that, they were involved in both the demise of Ramsay Bolton and fought alongside the Starks and their allies and are now part of the core group that will save Westeros from the apocalypse. So, unlike the Dothraki who are complete strangers to Westeros, the Wildlings are actually natives of this continent and are intimately involved in the goings on of the realm.\u00a0</p><p>Then there\u2019s the matter of Gendry. This could amount to something or it might not so take that with a grain of salt. But all of the Baratheons are dead, except for this one bastard that rowed his way back to Flee Bottom and has now been introduced back into the plot, fast becoming best friends with Jon and poised to meet his sister, Arya, with whom he might fall in love and marry. That, in geopolitical terms, is the potential start of a lifelong alliance. The fact that the show pointed to the close relationship between Robert and Ned in Gendry and Jon\u2019s first meeting feels like this relationship is bound to pay off in other ways aside from Gendry\u2019s superhuman running abilities. If Jon is to become a political player, he would be well served to legalize his sister\u2019s future husband and install him as the new Lord of the Stormlands, using the good will and strategic acumen he has gained to support his perhaps disputed decision. Because he will need people he can trust in high positions of power and Gendry is just that.\u00a0</p><p>Then there\u2019s the matter of Samwell Tarly. This is another way in which the burning of the Tarlys will come back to bite D*ny in the ass. Because Samwell, the disinherited son of Randall Tarly, is now the only male representative of House Tarly. And with the demise of House Tyrell, the Reach is up for grabs. House Tarly is the only reasonable candidate for this position. Sam would chew off his own arm before supporting the woman that burned his father and brother alive and besides that he\u2019s had \u201cI love Jon Snow\u201d carved across his chest since he first set eyes on the bastard of Winterfell.\u00a0</p><p>So two men that are friends with Jon Snow could, potentially, give Jon access to the Stormlands and the Reach. That\u2019s a start. :))))</p><p>But that\u2019s just a small part of what Jon Snow brings to the table because his true value lies in his prowess in battle and he\u2019s about to prove his worth in the greatest war/wars this continent has seen in 8000 years. However you chose to look at it, Westeros is a medieval society that is going through a period where warrior kings are the norm and what people expect from their leader.\u00a0</p><p>We have moved away from this type of worldview but a successful medieval king is a military commander, who is always leading his army from the front lines: prowess in battle, courage in the face of hand to hand combat inspire a type of loyalty and devotion that is hard to discount. That\u2019s what Edward I did, that\u2019s what Edward IV, Henry V, Robert the Bruce and countless other successful warrior kings did.\u00a0</p><p>Jon Snow is going to be spearheading the fight against the White Walkers and by the end of it he will be the military commander that saved Westeros from the end of the world. He will become a legendary figure in his own time. Forget Aemon the Dragonkinght and Florian the Fool, King Jon will be the guy generations of kids for hundreds of years will pretend to be while playing at swords. He\u2019ll essentially be the King Arthur of this universe. And that type of clout and image is hard to come by. If he ends up riding a dragon and riding Westeros of the Dragon Queen and the Dothraki as well, people will be one step away from treating him like a God-like figure. That\u2019s if he\u2019s alive by the end of the story, which I think he very much will.\u00a0</p><p>Then there\u2019s Sansa \u2026 let\u2019s talk about Sansa, shall we?\u00a0</p><p>Since about season 2, Sansa\u2019s political importance has been highlighted by the plot over and over again. Yes, yes, she doesn\u2019t wield a sword and she doesn\u2019t have dragons but then again neither did Elizabeth of York or Eleanor of Aquitaine or any of the countless heiresses of the medieval world.\u00a0</p><p>Sansa has been called the Key to the North by Varys for a reason and there\u2019s a reason why Tywin Lannister, Olenna Tyrell and Roose Bolton wanted her as wife for their sons/grandson. To quote Tywin:\u00a0\u201cWhoever marries Sansa Stark, has control of the North.\u201d</p><p>But, since then, Sansa\u2019s importance has only grown. And she is now not only the key to the North, but the most eligible match in the whole of Westeros. Because who ever marries Sansa Stark, essentially gets the keys to the kingdom and geopolitical dominance over the continent.\u00a0</p><p>Let\u2019s start with the North. There are two important factors that make Sansa essential to the North. For one, she is the heir apparent to Winterfell and the Stark ancestral seat, since Bran has renounced his claim. But because D*ny is stupidly generous, she helped Sansa become even more influential by forcing Jon to bend the knee. Jon\u2019s credibility and standing has been jeopardized by this decision. Instead of keeping him as King in the North and marrying him pronto, D*ny gave the keys to the North to Sansa, who has been diligently working to keep the North fed, clothed and ready for the war and who will now have a position of leadership in front of the whole North. If Sansa chooses to support Jon, this can\u2019t be beneficial to D*ny because the goals of the North/Sansa and D*ny\u2019s are bound to collide. So Sansa and Jon\u2019s alliance will come in direct opposition to D*ny\u2019s quest for the throne, whether or not either Jon or Sansa plan on it.\u00a0</p><p>But Sansa\u2019s importance stretches beyond the North. The obvious one is, of course, the Vale. The Vale is a historical ally of House Stark and the North. Robyn Arryn is Sansa\u2019s cousin on their mother\u2019s side and Littlefinger was kind enough to really drive home just how important supporting his cousin was supposed to be for Robyn. He did it for his own motives of course but there\u2019s no reason why Sansa wouldn\u2019t and couldn\u2019t take advantage of that now that Littlefinger is dead. Also, keeping Robyn happy is stupidly easy. Just imagine Jon giving him a ride on dragon back around the Eeryie. The kid will be a fan for life. In addition, Lord Royce is probably writing Sansa sonnets as we speak so the military arm of the Vale is firmly on Sansa\u2019s side.\u00a0</p><p>Then there\u2019s the matter of the Riverlands. Now that the Freys have been decimated by Arya, House Tully is poised to take back control of the region and here is where Jaime really screwed Cersei over. Because House Tully is headed by Edmure, the guy Jaime terrorized and forced to betray his blood with threats of killing his son. House Tully isn\u2019t supporting the Lannisters anytime soon, Edmure probably feels like he needs to atone for betraying the Blackfish (you can see by the way Tobias Menzies plays him that he regrets what he does but feels he has no choice) and the best way for him to do that is by supporting his only other relatives, the Starks, namely Sansa, aka the girl Blackfish said was just like her mother.\u00a0</p><p>Then there\u2019s the Greyjoys and the Iron Islands \u2026 Cersei, I think, will hold Euron\u2019s allegiance but Theon Greyjoy is on a quest to rescue his sister and he\u2019ll end up on a collision course with Euron. I\u2019m pretty sure Euron is biting the dust. I\u2019m also fairly certain Yara won\u2019t survive. Now even if you pretend that Theon has no issue with the fact that D*ny does fuck all to help free Yara, aside from giving Theon a boat or two, who do you think Theon, as the only Greyjoy and leader of the Iron Islands, is going to support? D*enerys Targareyen, a virtual stranger he got into an alliance with out of necessity or the family that raised him and that he identifies with, and also feels he has let down in the past. Theon is House Stark, all the way. And if he manages to defeat Euron, he\u2019ll have access to the best navy in the whole of Westeros.\u00a0</p><p>\n\nThat leaves, as you well pointed out, Dorne \u2026 But honestly I\u2019m not sure Dorne is much of a prize for anyone at this time. Nor are Jon and Sansa obsessed with collecting kingdoms, the way Cersei and D*ny are so they\u2019d probably leave Dorne to its own devices unless the Dornish themselves seek an alliance with them. And they\u2019d probably be best served to stay away from Dorne for the time being because I doubt the kingdom is in a good place right now.\u00a0<br/></p><p>As for Ellaria Sand, honestly I don\u2019t want her to make a come back in season 8. Her arc was concluded. Yes, supposedly she\u2019s still alive but what does she really have to bring to the table at this point? Her only claim to Dorne was through her bastard daughters (so not a claim at all as bastards can\u2019t inherit in Dorne anymore than in any other place in Westeros), and the Sand Snakes are dead (I know 2 of them weren\u2019t her daughters but the rest are children and not part of the show). They really did a number on the Dornish plot and went crazy with the laws of succession but in realistic terms, what Ellaria and the Sand Snakes did was a coup d\u2019etat and a pretty stupid one at that. They essentially threw their own country into political chaos and the Dornish, if they\u2019re smart and their history shows they are, should drop Ellaria like a hot potato. There\u2019s plenty of old families in Dorne, just as proud of their heritage and blood as the rest of the great houses of Westeros, so the country at this time is most likely in the midst of a civil war for control. In the future, an alliance with them might prove fruitful because they\u2019ll most likely avoid the whole War for the Dawn and Dance of Dragons that will ravage the rest of Westeros. They\u2019ll probably be able to rebuild more quickly. But Jon and Sansa don\u2019t need Ellaria for that. They can enter an alliance with Dorne\u2019s new leaders based on economical and political interests. They can even seal the deal with a mutually advantageous marriage.\u00a0</p><p>So, that begs the question, if House Stark is essentially running the board as the most influential house in Westeros, if between Jon\u2019s military abilities and Sansa\u2019s diplomatic and political maneuvering, they are capable of not only rallying people to their cause but also unite the whole continent under them, why the hell would they choose to support either the woman whose family killed their father, brother and mother, caused one sister to go on the run and tortured the other or the woman who is going around burning people alive and wants to conquer a war ravaged land with a hoard of rapists and murderers?\u00a0</p><p>Wouldn\u2019t it make much more sense for them to seize power for themselves? And wouldn\u2019t it make much more sense for Jon and Sansa to join their strategic and political advantages in marriage? This is a Ferdinand of Castile and Isabella of Aragon waiting to happen.</p><p>\u00a0Jon actually has nothing to gain and everything to lose by marrying D*ny and the same goes for a potential alliance between Sansa and Tyrion Lannister. Tyrion holds absolutely no power in Westeros, he\u2019s a kinslayer and he brought a foreign queen, two dragons and two armies of foreigners to the shores of his country. D*ny is the daughter of the Mad King, a man so reviled people thought Robert Baratehon was good by comparison, and she\u2019s going around imparting the very popular policy of fire and blood with everyone she comes in contact with. Those kinds of things are not easily dismissed and do not go unnoticed.\u00a0</p><p>Of course neither Jon or Sansa are thinking in terms of geopolitical hegemony at this time nor are they interested in the Iron Throne but between Cersei and D*ny, they will push them to the point where they will have to take action and assert themselves as the new power in Westeros, if they are to survive and thrive. It\u2019s also very likely that their allies will push for them to become king and queen because they\u2019ll understand that Jon and Sansa are their best ticket to a peaceful and healthy future Westeros.\u00a0</p><p>Thanks for the ask!</p>",

That\u2019s a start. :))))</p><p>But that\u2019s just a small part of what Jon Snow brings to the table because his true value lies in his prowess in battle and he\u2019s about to prove his worth in the greatest war/wars this continent has seen in 8000 years. However you chose to look at it, Westeros is a medieval society that is going through a period where warrior kings are the norm and what people expect from their leader.\u00a0</p><p>We have moved away from this type of worldview but a successful medieval king is a military commander, who is always leading his army from the front lines: prowess in battle, courage in the face of hand to hand combat inspire a type of loyalty and devotion that is hard to discount. That\u2019s what Edward I did, that\u2019s what Edward IV, Henry V, Robert the Bruce and countless other successful warrior kings did.\u00a0</p><p>Jon Snow is going to be spearheading the fight against the White Walkers and by the end of it he will be the military commander that saved Westeros from the end of the world. He will become a legendary figure in his own time. Forget Aemon the Dragonkinght and Florian the Fool, King Jon will be the guy generations of kids for hundreds of years will pretend to be while playing at swords. He\u2019ll essentially be the King Arthur of this universe. And that type of clout and image is hard to come by. If he ends up riding a dragon and riding Westeros of the Dragon Queen and the Dothraki as well, people will be one step away from treating him like a God-like figure. That\u2019s if he\u2019s alive by the end of the story, which I think he very much will.\u00a0</p><p>Then there\u2019s Sansa \u2026 let\u2019s talk about Sansa, shall we?\u00a0</p><p>Since about season 2, Sansa\u2019s political importance has been highlighted by the plot over and over again. Yes, yes, she doesn\u2019t wield a sword and she doesn\u2019t have dragons but then again neither did Elizabeth of York or Eleanor of Aquitaine or any of the countless heiresses of the medieval world.\u00a0</p><p>Sansa has been called the Key to the North by Varys for a reason and there\u2019s a reason why Tywin Lannister, Olenna Tyrell and Roose Bolton wanted her as wife for their sons/grandson. To quote Tywin:\u00a0\u201cWhoever marries Sansa Stark, has control of the North.\u201d</p><p>But, since then, Sansa\u2019s importance has only grown. And she is now not only the key to the North, but the most eligible match in the whole of Westeros. Because who ever marries Sansa Stark, essentially gets the keys to the kingdom and geopolitical dominance over the continent.\u00a0</p><p>Let\u2019s start with the North. There are two important factors that make Sansa essential to the North. For one, she is the heir apparent to Winterfell and the Stark ancestral seat, since Bran has renounced his claim. But because D*ny is stupidly generous, she helped Sansa become even more influential by forcing Jon to bend the knee. Jon\u2019s credibility and standing has been jeopardized by this decision. Instead of keeping him as King in the North and marrying him pronto, D*ny gave the keys to the North to Sansa, who has been diligently working to keep the North fed, clothed and ready for the war and who will now have a position of leadership in front of the whole North. If Sansa chooses to support Jon, this can\u2019t be beneficial to D*ny because the goals of the North/Sansa and D*ny\u2019s are bound to collide. So Sansa and Jon\u2019s alliance will come in direct opposition to D*ny\u2019s quest for the throne, whether or not either Jon or Sansa plan on it.\u00a0</p><p>But Sansa\u2019s importance stretches beyond the North. The obvious one is, of course, the Vale. The Vale is a historical ally of House Stark and the North. Robyn Arryn is Sansa\u2019s cousin on their mother\u2019s side and Littlefinger was kind enough to really drive home just how important supporting his cousin was supposed to be for Robyn. He did it for his own motives of course but there\u2019s no reason why Sansa wouldn\u2019t and couldn\u2019t take advantage of that now that Littlefinger is dead. Also, keeping Robyn happy is stupidly easy. Just imagine Jon giving him a ride on dragon back around the Eeryie. The kid will be a fan for life. In addition, Lord Royce is probably writing Sansa sonnets as we speak so the military arm of the Vale is firmly on Sansa\u2019s side.\u00a0</p><p>Then there\u2019s the matter of the Riverlands. Now that the Freys have been decimated by Arya, House Tully is poised to take back control of the region and here is where Jaime really screwed Cersei over. Because House Tully is headed by Edmure, the guy Jaime terrorized and forced to betray his blood with threats of killing his son. House Tully isn\u2019t supporting the Lannisters anytime soon, Edmure probably feels like he needs to atone for betraying the Blackfish (you can see by the way Tobias Menzies plays him that he regrets what he does but feels he has no choice) and the best way for him to do that is by supporting his only other relatives, the Starks, namely Sansa, aka the girl Blackfish said was just like her mother.\u00a0</p><p>Then there\u2019s the Greyjoys and the Iron Islands \u2026 Cersei, I think, will hold Euron\u2019s allegiance but Theon Greyjoy is on a quest to rescue his sister and he\u2019ll end up on a collision course with Euron. I\u2019m pretty sure Euron is biting the dust. I\u2019m also fairly certain Yara won\u2019t survive. Now even if you pretend that Theon has no issue with the fact that D*ny does fuck all to help free Yara, aside from giving Theon a boat or two, who do you think Theon, as the only Greyjoy and leader of the Iron Islands, is going to support? D*enerys Targareyen, a virtual stranger he got into an alliance with out of necessity or the family that raised him and that he identifies with, and also feels he has let down in the past. Theon is House Stark, all the way. And if he manages to defeat Euron, he\u2019ll have access to the best navy in the whole of Westeros.\u00a0</p><p>\n\nThat leaves, as you well pointed out, Dorne \u2026 But honestly I\u2019m not sure Dorne is much of a prize for anyone at this time. Nor are Jon and Sansa obsessed with collecting kingdoms, the way Cersei and D*ny are so they\u2019d probably leave Dorne to its own devices unless the Dornish themselves seek an alliance with them. And they\u2019d probably be best served to stay away from Dorne for the time being because I doubt the kingdom is in a good place right now.\u00a0<br></p><p>As for Ellaria Sand, honestly I don\u2019t want her to make a come back in season 8. Her arc was concluded. Yes, supposedly she\u2019s still alive but what does she really have to bring to the table at this point? Her only claim to Dorne was through her bastard daughters (so not a claim at all as bastards can\u2019t inherit in Dorne anymore than in any other place in Westeros), and the Sand Snakes are dead (I know 2 of them weren\u2019t her daughters but the rest are children and not part of the show). They really did a number on the Dornish plot and went crazy with the laws of succession but in realistic terms, what Ellaria and the Sand Snakes did was a coup d\u2019etat and a pretty stupid one at that. They essentially threw their own country into political chaos and the Dornish, if they\u2019re smart and their history shows they are, should drop Ellaria like a hot potato. There\u2019s plenty of old families in Dorne, just as proud of their heritage and blood as the rest of the great houses of Westeros, so the country at this time is most likely in the midst of a civil war for control. In the future, an alliance with them might prove fruitful because they\u2019ll most likely avoid the whole War for the Dawn and Dance of Dragons that will ravage the rest of Westeros. They\u2019ll probably be able to rebuild more quickly. But Jon and Sansa don\u2019t need Ellaria for that. They can enter an alliance with Dorne\u2019s new leaders based on economical and political interests. They can even seal the deal with a mutually advantageous marriage.\u00a0</p><p>So, that begs the question, if House Stark is essentially running the board as the most influential house in Westeros, if between Jon\u2019s military abilities and Sansa\u2019s diplomatic and political maneuvering, they are capable of not only rallying people to their cause but also unite the whole continent under them, why the hell would they choose to support either the woman whose family killed their father, brother and mother, caused one sister to go on the run and tortured the other or the woman who is going around burning people alive and wants to conquer a war ravaged land with a hoard of rapists and murderers?\u00a0</p><p>Wouldn\u2019t it make much more sense for them to seize power for themselves? And wouldn\u2019t it make much more sense for Jon and Sansa to join their strategic and political advantages in marriage? This is a Ferdinand of Castile and Isabella of Aragon waiting to happen.</p><p>\u00a0Jon actually has nothing to gain and everything to lose by marrying D*ny and the same goes for a potential alliance between Sansa and Tyrion Lannister. Tyrion holds absolutely no power in Westeros, he\u2019s a kinslayer and he brought a foreign queen, two dragons and two armies of foreigners to the shores of his country. D*ny is the daughter of the Mad King, a man so reviled people thought Robert Baratehon was good by comparison, and she\u2019s going around imparting the very popular policy of fire and blood with everyone she comes in contact with. Those kinds of things are not easily dismissed and do not go unnoticed.\u00a0</p><p>Of course neither Jon or Sansa are thinking in terms of geopolitical hegemony at this time nor are they interested in the Iron Throne but between Cersei and D*ny, they will push them to the point where they will have to take action and assert themselves as the new power in Westeros, if they are to survive and thrive. It\u2019s also very likely that their allies will push for them to become king and queen because they\u2019ll understand that Jon and Sansa are their best ticket to a peaceful and healthy future Westeros.\u00a0</p><p>Thanks for the ask!</p></p>",

If Dorne is still in play then there should be a stronger basis to make it long lasting. Sure Jon was born in Dorne but he\u2019s a Northerner. He has no allegiance to them.\n\n<br></p></blockquote><p>Hey, nonnie.</p><p>I\u2019ve been thinking a lot about this. Yesterday, in the comments section of my D*ny/Cersei <a href=\"https://fortunatelylori.tumblr.com/post/182193534051/do-you-think-it-means-anything-that-the-tarlys\">comparison post\u00a0</a>, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m9retLEdxQobBr_YU7YB92A\">@blurredblue</a> mentioned that Cersei\u2019s real weakness at this time is that she has no allies left in Westeros. And that got me thinking \u2026 That\u2019s essentially D*ny\u2019s problem as well.\u00a0</p><p>They sort of canceled each other out in season 7 on that front when Cersei took all of D*ny\u2019s allies out of play, thus leaving her without legitimacy in terms of launching her campaign. D*ny returned the favor by burning the Tarlys alive, and leaving Cersei without her only true Westerosi ally.\u00a0</p><p>But the burning of the Tarlys was also D*ny shooting herself in the foot because, his crappy parental treatment of his eldest son aside, Randall Tarly was a well respected member of the Westerosi aristocracy with a great military record. Not only that but by burning them alive without a trial and the legitimacy of a crown, D*ny committed a war crime by the laws established in this universe. As we remember from Robb\u2019s campaign, it\u2019s actually not ok or acceptable to kill prisoners of war in Westeros.\u00a0</p><p>But D*ny\u2019s biggest mistake to date is not that. The more I think of it the more I realize that in terms of strategy and diplomacy, her biggest mistake was her treatment of Jon Snow, aka The King in the North. Obviously all of this is predicated on the existence of political Jon in one form or another, which by and large has become, in my mind, the key GOT theory on which the entire Game of Thrones now rests. So for the remainder of this post, we will assume that in fact Jon\u2019s actions in season 7 were politically motivated and that he is not a Northern Fool/cinnamon roll who fell in love with the Mother of Dragons and is ready to give up everything for her, like countless less important male character before him.\u00a0</p><p>The reason why I say that D*ny\u2019s biggest mistake was her treatment of Jon is because, right now, House Stark is THE HOUSE you need in order to control Westeros. Dragons will only get you so far. You need alliances in order to establish a peaceful and successful rule and while everyone is bleeding allies left and right, House Stark, through Jon and Sansa, is racking in the numbers. If she had not been so greedy, if she weren\u2019t hell bent on dominance and submission of anyone she encounters, D*ny would have had a fantastic opportunity to enter a mutually beneficial alliance with House Stark, one established on collaboration not coercion. By dismissing Jon, demoting him, proving herself a fickle ally who is more likely to burn you alive than treat with you, by not entertaining the very pertinent reasons why the North is seeking its independence, she blew her chance at that alliance.</p>[[MORE]]<p>Tyrion, by the way, must share a part in this debacle because he tricks Jon into coming to Dragonstone, is as adamant about Jon bending the knee as D*ny is, albeit in a more diplomatic way and he fails to do his proper research in advance. He thinks Jon is the gullible King in the North and the North is an ally worth having, particularly once their other allies are wiped out, but he doesn\u2019t seem to understand that whoever holds the allegiance of House Stark will in fact hold the geopolitical hegemony over Westeros.\u00a0</p><p>Let\u2019s break it down:\u00a0</p><p>We\u2019ll start with Jon, since he is the titular leader of House Stark, despite his status as a bastard. In season 7, Sansa mentions that the Northern Lords are loyal, by and large, to Jon. We see Lord Glover and Lord Royce of the Vale mention that perhaps they should have elected Sansa as their Queen but the rest of the lords do not join in this conversation. They are, for the moment, holding fast behind their decision to elect Jon as King. Of course, strife is coming because of Jon\u2019s decision to bend the knee but considering that Sansa will most likely support him in front of the Great Council, the Northern Lords will probably stick around. Also, Jon has the Wildlings undivided loyalty.\u00a0</p><p>People could be excused in ignoring the Wildlings since they\u2019re a small group and one that has been brought South of the Wall only recently but the fact of the matter is they\u2019re here now and they\u2019re staying put. On top of that, they were involved in both the demise of Ramsay Bolton and fought alongside the Starks and their allies and are now part of the core group that will save Westeros from the apocalypse. So, unlike the Dothraki who are complete strangers to Westeros, the Wildlings are actually natives of this continent and are intimately involved in the goings on of the realm.\u00a0</p><p>Then there\u2019s the matter of Gendry. This could amount to something or it might not so take that with a grain of salt. But all of the Baratheons are dead, except for this one bastard that rowed his way back to Flee Bottom and has now been introduced back into the plot, fast becoming best friends with Jon and poised to meet his sister, Arya, with whom he might fall in love and marry. That, in geopolitical terms, is the potential start of a lifelong alliance. The fact that the show pointed to the close relationship between Robert and Ned in Gendry and Jon\u2019s first meeting feels like this relationship is bound to pay off in other ways aside from Gendry\u2019s superhuman running abilities. If Jon is to become a political player, he would be well served to legalize his sister\u2019s future husband and install him as the new Lord of the Stormlands, using the good will and strategic acumen he has gained to support his perhaps disputed decision. Because he will need people he can trust in high positions of power and Gendry is just that.\u00a0</p><p>Then there\u2019s the matter of Samwell Tarly. This is another way in which the burning of the Tarlys will come back to bite D*ny in the ass. Because Samwell, the disinherited son of Randall Tarly, is now the only male representative of House Tarly. And with the demise of House Tyrell, the Reach is up for grabs. House Tarly is the only reasonable candidate for this position. Sam would chew off his own arm before supporting the woman that burned his father and brother alive and besides that he\u2019s had \u201cI love Jon Snow\u201d carved across his chest since he first set eyes on the bastard of Winterfell.\u00a0</p><p>So two men that are friends with Jon Snow could, potentially, give Jon access to the Stormlands and the Reach. That\u2019s a start. :))))</p><p>But that\u2019s just a small part of what Jon Snow brings to the table because his true value lies in his prowess in battle and he\u2019s about to prove his worth in the greatest war/wars this continent has seen in 8000 years. However you chose to look at it, Westeros is a medieval society that is going through a period where warrior kings are the norm and what people expect from their leader.\u00a0</p><p>We have moved away from this type of worldview but a successful medieval king is a military commander, who is always leading his army from the front lines: prowess in battle, courage in the face of hand to hand combat inspire a type of loyalty and devotion that is hard to discount. That\u2019s what Edward I did, that\u2019s what Edward IV, Henry V, Robert the Bruce and countless other successful warrior kings did.\u00a0</p><p>Jon Snow is going to be spearheading the fight against the White Walkers and by the end of it he will be the military commander that saved Westeros from the end of the world. He will become a legendary figure in his own time. Forget Aemon the Dragonkinght and Florian the Fool, King Jon will be the guy generations of kids for hundreds of years will pretend to be while playing at swords. He\u2019ll essentially be the King Arthur of this universe. And that type of clout and image is hard to come by. If he ends up riding a dragon and riding Westeros of the Dragon Queen and the Dothraki as well, people will be one step away from treating him like a God-like figure. That\u2019s if he\u2019s alive by the end of the story, which I think he very much will.\u00a0</p><p>Then there\u2019s Sansa \u2026 let\u2019s talk about Sansa, shall we?\u00a0</p><p>Since about season 2, Sansa\u2019s political importance has been highlighted by the plot over and over again.

They can even seal the deal with a mutually advantageous marriage.\u00a0</p><p>So, that begs the question, if House Stark is essentially running the board as the most influential house in Westeros, if between Jon\u2019s military abilities and Sansa\u2019s diplomatic and political maneuvering, they are capable of not only rallying people to their cause but also unite the whole continent under them, why the hell would they choose to support either the woman whose family killed their father, brother and mother, caused one sister to go on the run and tortured the other or the woman who is going around burning people alive and wants to conquer a war ravaged land with a hoard of rapists and murderers?\u00a0</p><p>Wouldn\u2019t it make much more sense for them to seize power for themselves? And wouldn\u2019t it make much more sense for Jon and Sansa to join their strategic and political advantages in marriage? This is a Ferdinand of Castile and Isabella of Aragon waiting to happen.</p><p>\u00a0Jon actually has nothing to gain and everything to lose by marrying D*ny and the same goes for a potential alliance between Sansa and Tyrion Lannister. Tyrion holds absolutely no power in Westeros, he\u2019s a kinslayer and he brought a foreign queen, two dragons and two armies of foreigners to the shores of his country. D*ny is the daughter of the Mad King, a man so reviled people thought Robert Baratehon was good by comparison, and she\u2019s going around imparting the very popular policy of fire and blood with everyone she comes in contact with. Those kinds of things are not easily dismissed and do not go unnoticed.\u00a0</p><p>Of course neither Jon or Sansa are thinking in terms of geopolitical hegemony at this time nor are they interested in the Iron Throne but between Cersei and D*ny, they will push them to the point where they will have to take action and assert themselves as the new power in Westeros, if they are to survive and thrive. It\u2019s also very likely that their allies will push for them to become king and queen because they\u2019ll understand that Jon and Sansa are their best ticket to a peaceful and healthy future Westeros.\u00a0</p><p>Thanks for the ask!</p></p>",

Yesterday, in the comments section of my D*ny/Cersei <a href=\"https://fortunatelylori.tumblr.com/post/182193534051/do-you-think-it-means-anything-that-the-tarlys\">comparison post&nbsp;</a>, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m9retLEdxQobBr_YU7YB92A\">@blurredblue</a> mentioned that Cersei&rsquo;s real weakness at this time is that she has no allies left in Westeros. And that got me thinking &hellip; That&rsquo;s essentially D*ny&rsquo;s problem as well.&nbsp;</p><p>They sort of canceled each other out in season 7 on that front when Cersei took all of D*ny&rsquo;s allies out of play, thus leaving her without legitimacy in terms of launching her campaign. D*ny returned the favor by burning the Tarlys alive, and leaving Cersei without her only true Westerosi ally.&nbsp;</p><p>But the burning of the Tarlys was also D*ny shooting herself in the foot because, his crappy parental treatment of his eldest son aside, Randall Tarly was a well respected member of the Westerosi aristocracy with a great military record. Not only that but by burning them alive without a trial and the legitimacy of a crown, D*ny committed a war crime by the laws established in this universe. As we remember from Robb&rsquo;s campaign, it&rsquo;s actually not ok or acceptable to kill prisoners of war in Westeros.&nbsp;</p><p>But D*ny&rsquo;s biggest mistake to date is not that. The more I think of it the more I realize that in terms of strategy and diplomacy, her biggest mistake was her treatment of Jon Snow, aka The King in the North. Obviously all of this is predicated on the existence of political Jon in one form or another, which by and large has become, in my mind, the key GOT theory on which the entire Game of Thrones now rests. So for the remainder of this post, we will assume that in fact Jon&rsquo;s actions in season 7 were politically motivated and that he is not a Northern Fool/cinnamon roll who fell in love with the Mother of Dragons and is ready to give up everything for her, like countless less important male character before him.&nbsp;</p><p>The reason why I say that D*ny&rsquo;s biggest mistake was her treatment of Jon is because, right now, House Stark is THE HOUSE you need in order to control Westeros. Dragons will only get you so far. You need alliances in order to establish a peaceful and successful rule and while everyone is bleeding allies left and right, House Stark, through Jon and Sansa, is racking in the numbers. If she had not been so greedy, if she weren&rsquo;t hell bent on dominance and submission of anyone she encounters, D*ny would have had a fantastic opportunity to enter a mutually beneficial alliance with House Stark, one established on collaboration not coercion. By dismissing Jon, demoting him, proving herself a fickle ally who is more likely to burn you alive than treat with you, by not entertaining the very pertinent reasons why the North is seeking its independence, she blew her chance at that alliance.</p><p>Tyrion, by the way, must share a part in this debacle because he tricks Jon into coming to Dragonstone, is as adamant about Jon bending the knee as D*ny is, albeit in a more diplomatic way and he fails to do his proper research in advance. He thinks Jon is the gullible King in the North and the North is an ally worth having, particularly once their other allies are wiped out, but he doesn&rsquo;t seem to understand that whoever holds the allegiance of House Stark will in fact hold the geopolitical hegemony over Westeros.&nbsp;</p><p>Let&rsquo;s break it down:&nbsp;</p><p>We&rsquo;ll start with Jon, since he is the titular leader of House Stark, despite his status as a bastard. In season 7, Sansa mentions that the Northern Lords are loyal, by and large, to Jon. We see Lord Glover and Lord Royce of the Vale mention that perhaps they should have elected Sansa as their Queen but the rest of the lords do not join in this conversation. They are, for the moment, holding fast behind their decision to elect Jon as King. Of course, strife is coming because of Jon&rsquo;s decision to bend the knee but considering that Sansa will most likely support him in front of the Great Council, the Northern Lords will probably stick around. Also, Jon has the Wildlings undivided loyalty.&nbsp;</p><p>People could be excused in ignoring the Wildlings since they&rsquo;re a small group and one that has been brought South of the Wall only recently but the fact of the matter is they&rsquo;re here now and they&rsquo;re staying put. On top of that, they were involved in both the demise of Ramsay Bolton and fought alongside the Starks and their allies and are now part of the core group that will save Westeros from the apocalypse. So, unlike the Dothraki who are complete strangers to Westeros, the Wildlings are actually natives of this continent and are intimately involved in the goings on of the realm.&nbsp;</p><p>Then there&rsquo;s the matter of Gendry. This could amount to something or it might not so take that with a grain of salt. But all of the Baratheons are dead, except for this one bastard that rowed his way back to Flee Bottom and has now been introduced back into the plot, fast becoming best friends with Jon and poised to meet his sister, Arya, with whom he might fall in love and marry. That, in geopolitical terms, is the potential start of a lifelong alliance. The fact that the show pointed to the close relationship between Robert and Ned in Gendry and Jon&rsquo;s first meeting feels like this relationship is bound to pay off in other ways aside from Gendry&rsquo;s superhuman running abilities. If Jon is to become a political player, he would be well served to legalize his sister&rsquo;s future husband and install him as the new Lord of the Stormlands, using the good will and strategic acumen he has gained to support his perhaps disputed decision. Because he will need people he can trust in high positions of power and Gendry is just that.&nbsp;</p><p>Then there&rsquo;s the matter of Samwell Tarly. This is another way in which the burning of the Tarlys will come back to bite D*ny in the ass. Because Samwell, the disinherited son of Randall Tarly, is now the only male representative of House Tarly. And with the demise of House Tyrell, the Reach is up for grabs. House Tarly is the only reasonable candidate for this position. Sam would chew off his own arm before supporting the woman that burned his father and brother alive and besides that he&rsquo;s had &ldquo;I love Jon Snow&rdquo; carved across his chest since he first set eyes on the bastard of Winterfell.&nbsp;</p><p>So two men that are friends with Jon Snow could, potentially, give Jon access to the Stormlands and the Reach. That&rsquo;s a start. :))))</p><p>But that&rsquo;s just a small part of what Jon Snow brings to the table because his true value lies in his prowess in battle and he&rsquo;s about to prove his worth in the greatest war/wars this continent has seen in 8000 years. However you chose to look at it, Westeros is a medieval society that is going through a period where warrior kings are the norm and what people expect from their leader.&nbsp;</p><p>We have moved away from this type of worldview but a successful medieval king is a military commander, who is always leading his army from the front lines: prowess in battle, courage in the face of hand to hand combat inspire a type of loyalty and devotion that is hard to discount. That&rsquo;s what Edward I did, that&rsquo;s what Edward IV, Henry V, Robert the Bruce and countless other successful warrior kings did.&nbsp;</p><p>Jon Snow is going to be spearheading the fight against the White Walkers and by the end of it he will be the military commander that saved Westeros from the end of the world. He will become a legendary figure in his own time. Forget Aemon the Dragonkinght and Florian the Fool, King Jon will be the guy generations of kids for hundreds of years will pretend to be while playing at swords. He&rsquo;ll essentially be the King Arthur of this universe. And that type of clout and image is hard to come by. If he ends up riding a dragon and riding Westeros of the Dragon Queen and the Dothraki as well, people will be one step away from treating him like a God-like figure. That&rsquo;s if he&rsquo;s alive by the end of the story, which I think he very much will.&nbsp;</p><p>Then there&rsquo;s Sansa &hellip; let&rsquo;s talk about Sansa, shall we?&nbsp;</p><p>Since about season 2, Sansa&rsquo;s political importance has been highlighted by the plot over and over again. Yes, yes, she doesn&rsquo;t wield a sword and she doesn&rsquo;t have dragons but then again neither did Elizabeth of York or Eleanor of Aquitaine or any of the countless heiresses of the medieval world.&nbsp;</p><p>Sansa has been called the Key to the North by Varys for a reason and there&rsquo;s a reason why Tywin Lannister, Olenna Tyrell and Roose Bolton wanted her as wife for their sons/grandson. To quote Tywin:&nbsp;&ldquo;Whoever marries Sansa Stark, has control of the North.&rdquo;</p><p>But, since then, Sansa&rsquo;s importance has only grown. And she is now not only the key to the North, but the most eligible match in the whole of Westeros. Because who ever marries Sansa Stark, essentially gets the keys to the kingdom and geopolitical dominance over the continent.&nbsp;</p><p>Let&rsquo;s start with the North. There are two important factors that make Sansa essential to the North. For one, she is the heir apparent to Winterfell and the Stark ancestral seat, since Bran has renounced his claim. But because D*ny is stupidly generous, she helped Sansa become even more influential by forcing Jon to bend the knee. Jon&rsquo;s credibility and standing has been jeopardized by this decision. Instead of keeping him as King in the North and marrying him pronto, D*ny gave the keys to the North to Sansa, who has been diligently working to keep the North fed, clothed and ready for the war and who will now have a position of leadership in front of the whole North. If Sansa chooses to support Jon, this can&rsquo;t be beneficial to D*ny because the goals of the North/Sansa and D*ny&rsquo;s are bound to collide. So Sansa and Jon&rsquo;s alliance will come in direct opposition to D*ny&rsquo;s quest for the throne, whether or not either Jon or Sansa plan on it.&nbsp;</p><p>But Sansa&rsquo;s importance stretches beyond the North. The obvious one is, of course, the Vale. The Vale is a historical ally of House Stark and the North. Robyn Arryn is Sansa&rsquo;s cousin on their mother&rsquo;s side and Littlefinger was kind enough to really drive home just how important supporting his cousin was supposed to be for Robyn. He did it for his own motives of course but there&rsquo;s no reason why Sansa wouldn&rsquo;t and couldn&rsquo;t take advantage of that now that Littlefinger is dead. Also, keeping Robyn happy is stupidly easy. Just imagine Jon giving him a ride on dragon back around the Eeryie. The kid will be a fan for life. In addition, Lord Royce is probably writing Sansa sonnets as we speak so the military arm of the Vale is firmly on Sansa&rsquo;s side.&nbsp;</p><p>Then there&rsquo;s the matter of the Riverlands. Now that the Freys have been decimated by Arya, House Tully is poised to take back control of the region and here is where Jaime really screwed Cersei over. Because House Tully is headed by Edmure, the guy Jaime terrorized and forced to betray his blood with threats of killing his son. House Tully isn&rsquo;t supporting the Lannisters anytime soon, Edmure probably feels like he needs to atone for betraying the Blackfish (you can see by the way Tobias Menzies plays him that he regrets what he does but feels he has no choice) and the best way for him to do that is by supporting his only other relatives, the Starks, namely Sansa, aka the girl Blackfish said was just like her mother.&nbsp;</p><p>Then there&rsquo;s the Greyjoys and the Iron Islands &hellip; Cersei, I think, will hold Euron&rsquo;s allegiance but Theon Greyjoy is on a quest to rescue his sister and he&rsquo;ll end up on a collision course with Euron. I&rsquo;m pretty sure Euron is biting the dust. I&rsquo;m also fairly certain Yara won&rsquo;t survive. Now even if you pretend that Theon has no issue with the fact that D*ny does fuck all to help free Yara, aside from giving Theon a boat or two, who do you think Theon, as the only Greyjoy and leader of the Iron Islands, is going to support? D*enerys Targareyen, a virtual stranger he got into an alliance with out of necessity or the family that raised him and that he identifies with, and also feels he has let down in the past. Theon is House Stark, all the way. And if he manages to defeat Euron, he&rsquo;ll have access to the best navy in the whole of Westeros.&nbsp;</p><p>\n\nThat leaves, as you well pointed out, Dorne &hellip; But honestly I&rsquo;m not sure Dorne is much of a prize for anyone at this time. Nor are Jon and Sansa obsessed with collecting kingdoms, the way Cersei and D*ny are so they&rsquo;d probably leave Dorne to its own devices unless the Dornish themselves seek an alliance with them. And they&rsquo;d probably be best served to stay away from Dorne for the time being because I doubt the kingdom is in a good place right now.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>As for Ellaria Sand, honestly I don&rsquo;t want her to make a come back in season 8. Her arc was concluded. Yes, supposedly she&rsquo;s still alive but what does she really have to bring to the table at this point? Her only claim to Dorne was through her bastard daughters (so not a claim at all as bastards can&rsquo;t inherit in Dorne anymore than in any other place in Westeros), and the Sand Snakes are dead (I know 2 of them weren&rsquo;t her daughters but the rest are children and not part of the show). They really did a number on the Dornish plot and went crazy with the laws of succession but in realistic terms, what Ellaria and the Sand Snakes did was a coup d&rsquo;etat and a pretty stupid one at that. They essentially threw their own country into political chaos and the Dornish, if they&rsquo;re smart and their history shows they are, should drop Ellaria like a hot potato. There&rsquo;s plenty of old families in Dorne, just as proud of their heritage and blood as the rest of the great houses of Westeros, so the country at this time is most likely in the midst of a civil war for control. In the future, an alliance with them might prove fruitful because they&rsquo;ll most likely avoid the whole War for the Dawn and Dance of Dragons that will ravage the rest of Westeros. They&rsquo;ll probably be able to rebuild more quickly. But Jon and Sansa don&rsquo;t need Ellaria for that. They can enter an alliance with Dorne&rsquo;s new leaders based on economical and political interests. They can even seal the deal with a mutually advantageous marriage.&nbsp;</p><p>So, that begs the question, if House Stark is essentially running the board as the most influential house in Westeros, if between Jon&rsquo;s military abilities and Sansa&rsquo;s diplomatic and political maneuvering, they are capable of not only rallying people to their cause but also unite the whole continent under them, why the hell would they choose to support either the woman whose family killed their father, brother and mother, caused one sister to go on the run and tortured the other or the woman who is going around burning people alive and wants to conquer a war ravaged land with a hoard of rapists and murderers?&nbsp;</p><p>Wouldn&rsquo;t it make much more sense for them to seize power for themselves? And wouldn&rsquo;t it make much more sense for Jon and Sansa to join their strategic and political advantages in marriage? This is a Ferdinand of Castile and Isabella of Aragon waiting to happen.</p><p>&nbsp;Jon actually has nothing to gain and everything to lose by marrying D*ny and the same goes for a potential alliance between Sansa and Tyrion Lannister. Tyrion holds absolutely no power in Westeros, he&rsquo;s a kinslayer and he brought a foreign queen, two dragons and two armies of foreigners to the shores of his country.

If they aren't gonna fall in love, why choose those two of all the Stark family to bring together?",

She doesn\u2019t wear grey, she comes the wrong way and she is not Jon\u2019s sister.</p><p>2) What the persons in the book think the prophecy is about, ususally is not what the prophecy is about. There is one identification that the person in the books does, there is one that is another solution that immediately comes to the reader\u2019s mind and one person who actually does fulfill the prophecy&hellip; Look at Cersei and the Valonqar. Cersei thinks it\u2019s Tyrion, the reader is reminded time and again that it might be Jaime (who is younger than Cersei), and then probably another younger sibling alltogether (maybe even the younger sibling of the Younger more beautiful queen, and that might be Bran or Arya). So, Jon thinks the prophecy is about Arya, but when Alys arrives, he thinks Mel was wrong, the reader thinks it is Jeyne Poole, the girl who was forced to marry Ramsay in the books, and the girl in grey actually is Sansa.</p><p>3) While Sansa took over Jeyne Poole\u2019s (aka fArya\u2019s) storyline D&amp;D have told the audience that they decided to swap Sansa for Jeyne to reduce the vast amount of characters and because \u201cSansa wouldn\u2019t stay much longer in the Vale anyway\u201d. Despite this very strong hint by D&amp;D, that Sansa actually will go North, Non Jonsas have somehow refused to take the hint and make up whole storylines of what will happen in the Vale, even predicting that Sansa won\u2019t go North anytime soon.

It will be different but not that different and Sansa coming North is such a huge development, that it makes only sense for the show to do this, if Sansa indeed will arrive at Castle Black in TWOW.</p><p>In addition I\u2019ll add 4), my own ideas why Sansa as the girl in grey makes perfect sense within the story, because Sansa has a key task in regard to Jon.</p><p>I do think that Sansa\u2019s magic is about singing, and that her ability of empathy and singing will be the crucial factor that brings Jon back to life (in a metaphorical way). In the show they made it obvious that Sansa inspires Jon to try again and fight. In the books I think either Jon won\u2019t be resurrected until Sansa arrives, or will be still in some state of aloofness and listlessness. She will probably sing \u201cFlorian and Jonquil\u201d to him - mirroring Luthien and Arwen from Tolkien at the same time - compare my metas on \u201cSingers singing songs\u201d and \u201cBeren and Luthien\u201d. So there is a Tolkien parallel which adds up to an already plausible scenario.</p><p>And Jon, confused and distraught after his resurrection, set on the task of rescuing his sister - which was the last thing he thought of - will meet Sansa as if she was someone new and unknown - a scenario that willl make him falling in love easily believable.</p><p>Thanks for the ask!</p>",
