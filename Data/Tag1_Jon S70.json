As a side note, I find it amusing that in this episode Sansa&rsquo;s influence became very apparent. When she was speaking at the Great Hall, Lord Umber addressed her first. Then later on Lord Yohn Royce was speaking with her when Tyrion interrupted. For me this confirms the trust she built with her bannerman, they respect her opinion and council. Not to shame Jon, he truly left the North in good hands, but he disregarded his responsibilities as King. Just to prove Sansa is the true Queen!!

The Dreadfort. Guess who owns it. That&rsquo;s right; horrible as her marriage to Ramsay was it was legitimate, and with the deaths of the rest of the Boltons that leaves the Dreadfort, and all it&rsquo;s surrounding lands, as Sansa&rsquo;s legal property.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"224\" data-orig-width=\"400\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"thedarthlola:k7dVYPReTAfdqmEwptlenA:ZjDbIy2KcJuo6\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/2bf35669cf83323b0aa44b75330b7a82/tumblr_oodzjzCw3B1qc568so1_400.gif\" data-orig-height=\"224\" data-orig-width=\"400\"/></figure><p>But what about the rest of Westeros? Well this is where the potential of Sansa&rsquo;s family ties come into play. </p><p>First there&rsquo;s the Eyrie, located in the Vale; the most strategically secure part of Westeros, courtesy of those fuck-off-massive mountains. Ruled over by little Robin Arryn. </p><p>And then there&rsquo;s Riverrun, capital of the Riverlands, home of the Lords Paramount of the Tridant, childhood home of Catelyn Stark, currently ruled by Edmure Tully, but really by the Lannisters.</p><p>On the surface, both these gentlemen cancel out Sansa&rsquo;s claim on each other&rsquo;s lands. Now that Littlefinger is dead, Edmure is is Robin&rsquo;s eldest relative, and should therefore be his guardian. Edmure has a son, and in the event of both their deaths, Robin is easily his heir.</p><p>So where does Sansa come in? Well first of all, due to a little political wrinkle, there&rsquo;s no way Edmure could possibly be Robin&rsquo;s guardian. As stated, Edmure is a puppet owned by the Lannisters, while the Eyrie is very firmly Team Stark. </p><p>Not only is Sansa his next eldest relative, she&rsquo;s also the only relative to have a personal relationship with both Robin and the Lords of the Vale, and as stated multiple times, they rode north, to help liberate Winterfell, for her. She&rsquo;s apparently happy for Robin to remain under Lord Royce&rsquo;s care, and presumably for Royce to be Lord Protector of the Vale. But check out how close she and Royce are now, they&rsquo;re tight.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"238\" data-orig-width=\"480\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"sanstarks:uQIlJ7XirjWAKdEZnWMmdg:ZQpy7f2OQIsKt\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/93a773c11ac91fe3dece9fa0909f933e/tumblr_otz3w76ce41w0y6kho1_500.gif\" data-orig-height=\"238\" data-orig-width=\"480\"/></figure><p>So what about Riverrun? Well the Riverlands are in a weird limbo currently. While the Lannisters had control of Edmure and the Tully lands, the Riverlands and the Trident were run by their allies the Freys. But now the Freys have all come over with an unfortunate case of dead, leaving the Lannister foothold in the Riverlands somewhere between weak and non-existent.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"364\" data-orig-width=\"648\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"house-stargaryen-got:0O6c4pL_jNs2TvJdXrp2Gg:ZpnSsc2b6w2D8\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/c0b6860bd4e76171eb65d6aed1e7d2f2/tumblr_pbev5dd2fW1wancwqo3_1280.gif\" data-orig-height=\"364\" data-orig-width=\"648\"/></figure><p>So where does that leave poor Edmure? He handed over Riverrun to the Lannisters, getting his uncle killed in the process, but there&rsquo;s certainly no love for them. It&rsquo;s likely he&rsquo;ll boot whatever presence the crown still has out of the Riverlands first chance he&rsquo;ll get. Whether he&rsquo;ll go full Team Stark is more debatable, I see him more as a go-away-and-stop-bothering-me type of ruler. However, the Riverlands are what separate the North from the rest of the country, so sooner or later he&rsquo;s going to have to pick a side and well, one side murdered his sister, nephew and held him and his son hostage for three years. </p><p>Not to put too fine a point on it, but I don&rsquo;t see much future for Edmure; if he chooses the Starks, Cersei will seek revenge. If he, for some reason, chooses the Lannisters, a combination of dragons, northerners and white walkers will go after him. So yeah, sorry Edmure and your unnamed, unseen son. You&rsquo;re dead. </p><p>So who is the heir to Riverrun after Edmure?

Ruled over by little Robin Arryn. </p><p>And then there\u2019s Riverrun, capital of the Riverlands, home of the Lords Paramount of the Tridant, childhood home of Catelyn Stark, currently ruled by Edmure Tully, but really by the Lannisters.</p><p>On the surface, both these gentlemen cancel out Sansa\u2019s claim on each other\u2019s lands. Now that Littlefinger is dead, Edmure is is Robin\u2019s eldest relative, and should therefore be his guardian. Edmure has a son, and in the event of both their deaths, Robin is easily his heir.</p><p>So where does Sansa come in? Well first of all, due to a little political wrinkle, there\u2019s no way Edmure could possibly be Robin\u2019s guardian. As stated, Edmure is a puppet owned by the Lannisters, while the Eyrie is very firmly Team Stark. </p><p>Not only is Sansa his next eldest relative, she\u2019s also the only relative to have a personal relationship with both Robin and the Lords of the Vale, and as stated multiple times, they rode north, to help liberate Winterfell, for her. She\u2019s apparently happy for Robin to remain under Lord Royce\u2019s care, and presumably for Royce to be Lord Protector of the Vale. But check out how close she and Royce are now, they\u2019re tight.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"238\" data-orig-width=\"480\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"sanstarks:uQIlJ7XirjWAKdEZnWMmdg:ZQpy7f2OQIsKt\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/93a773c11ac91fe3dece9fa0909f933e/tumblr_otz3w76ce41w0y6kho1_500.gif\" data-orig-height=\"238\" data-orig-width=\"480\"></figure><p>So what about Riverrun?

But now the Freys have all come over with an unfortunate case of dead, leaving the Lannister foothold in the Riverlands somewhere between weak and non-existent.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"364\" data-orig-width=\"648\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"house-stargaryen-got:0O6c4pL_jNs2TvJdXrp2Gg:ZpnSsc2b6w2D8\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/c0b6860bd4e76171eb65d6aed1e7d2f2/tumblr_pbev5dd2fW1wancwqo3_1280.gif\" data-orig-height=\"364\" data-orig-width=\"648\"></figure><p>So where does that leave poor Edmure? He handed over Riverrun to the Lannisters, getting his uncle killed in the process, but there\u2019s certainly no love for them. It\u2019s likely he\u2019ll boot whatever presence the crown still has out of the Riverlands first chance he\u2019ll get. Whether he\u2019ll go full Team Stark is more debatable, I see him more as a go-away-and-stop-bothering-me type of ruler. However, the Riverlands are what separate the North from the rest of the country, so sooner or later he\u2019s going to have to pick a side and well, one side murdered his sister, nephew and held him and his son hostage for three years. </p><p>Not to put too fine a point on it, but I don\u2019t see much future for Edmure; if he chooses the Starks, Cersei will seek revenge. If he, for some reason, chooses the Lannisters, a combination of dragons, northerners and white walkers will go after him. So yeah, sorry Edmure and your unnamed, unseen son.

                "content": "<p><h1>You know, I don&rsquo;t think enough attention is given to just how powerful Sansa is.</h1><p>So first things first, my girl is the Lady of Winterfell, the most powerful castle in the North. Further more, during Jon&rsquo;s admittedly short reign she was not only his regent but his heir, and the the rest of the Northern lords have made it abundantly clear that they prefer her to Jon. </p><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"0\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><p>Oh, and speaking of the North, guess which is the second most powerful castle there. The Dreadfort. Guess who owns it. That&rsquo;s right; horrible as her marriage to Ramsay was it was legitimate, and with the deaths of the rest of the Boltons that leaves the Dreadfort, and all it&rsquo;s surrounding lands, as Sansa&rsquo;s legal property.</p><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"1\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><p>But what about the rest of Westeros? Well this is where the potential of Sansa&rsquo;s family ties come into play. </p><p>First there&rsquo;s the Eyrie, located in the Vale; the most strategically secure part of Westeros, courtesy of those fuck-off-massive mountains. Ruled over by little Robin Arryn. </p><p>And then there&rsquo;s Riverrun, capital of the Riverlands, home of the Lords Paramount of the Tridant, childhood home of Catelyn Stark, currently ruled by Edmure Tully, but really by the Lannisters.</p><p>On the surface, both these gentlemen cancel out Sansa&rsquo;s claim on each other&rsquo;s lands. Now that Littlefinger is dead, Edmure is is Robin&rsquo;s eldest relative, and should therefore be his guardian. Edmure has a son, and in the event of both their deaths, Robin is easily his heir.</p><p>So where does Sansa come in? Well first of all, due to a little political wrinkle, there&rsquo;s no way Edmure could possibly be Robin&rsquo;s guardian. As stated, Edmure is a puppet owned by the Lannisters, while the Eyrie is very firmly Team Stark. </p><p>Not only is Sansa his next eldest relative, she&rsquo;s also the only relative to have a personal relationship with both Robin and the Lords of the Vale, and as stated multiple times, they rode north, to help liberate Winterfell, for her. She&rsquo;s apparently happy for Robin to remain under Lord Royce&rsquo;s care, and presumably for Royce to be Lord Protector of the Vale. But check out how close she and Royce are now, they&rsquo;re tight.</p><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"2\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><p>So what about Riverrun? Well the Riverlands are in a weird limbo currently. While the Lannisters had control of Edmure and the Tully lands, the Riverlands and the Trident were run by their allies the Freys. But now the Freys have all come over with an unfortunate case of dead, leaving the Lannister foothold in the Riverlands somewhere between weak and non-existent.</p><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"3\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><p>So where does that leave poor Edmure? He handed over Riverrun to the Lannisters, getting his uncle killed in the process, but there&rsquo;s certainly no love for them. It&rsquo;s likely he&rsquo;ll boot whatever presence the crown still has out of the Riverlands first chance he&rsquo;ll get. Whether he&rsquo;ll go full Team Stark is more debatable, I see him more as a go-away-and-stop-bothering-me type of ruler. However, the Riverlands are what separate the North from the rest of the country, so sooner or later he&rsquo;s going to have to pick a side and well, one side murdered his sister, nephew and held him and his son hostage for three years. </p><p>Not to put too fine a point on it, but I don&rsquo;t see much future for Edmure; if he chooses the Starks, Cersei will seek revenge. If he, for some reason, chooses the Lannisters, a combination of dragons, northerners and white walkers will go after him. So yeah, sorry Edmure and your unnamed, unseen son. You&rsquo;re dead. </p><p>So who is the heir to Riverrun after Edmure? You guessed it.</p><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"4\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><p>But Connie, I hear you cry, what about Bran? Yes for all Sansa&rsquo;s power, she&rsquo;s still cursed with that pesky vagina of hers. Surely Bran would be the heir to Riverrun and Guardian of the Vale?</p><p>Well no. Because Bran.</p><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"5\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><p>Then of there&rsquo;s Tarth, beautiful, strategically placed Tarth. Seriously, look it up- it&rsquo;s right next to the Stormlands just north of ship breaker bay. Ruled by Lord Selwyn Tarth who&rsquo;s only child Brienne happens to be the sworn sword of&hellip;</p><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"6\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><p>&hellip;this Bitch.</p><p>For those keeping score, that is about half a continent either ruled by or loyal to The Queen In The North. And I&rsquo;m not even touching on her ties to Casterly Rock and the Iron Islands.</p><p>And yes. I said Queen In The North. Because something else that no one ever actually touches on is her connection to Robb.</p><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"7\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><p>Remember Robb? Remember how he died?

        "question": "I don't really think all this hate on Jon makes sense. If he hadn't gone to Dany for help, then there would be no way that the north could have defended themselves against the zombies. I think Sansa is upset about the decision because she didn't have anything to do with it. Her protests stopped immediately after Jon said he was leaving her in charge, which is really all she wanted. She is mad that Dany is there because it threatens her power. She was ready to kill Arya, but Jon betrayed them?",
        "answer": "<p>First of all, I want to apologize for getting to this so late.  It showed up in my notifications the other day just before I went to sleep and o totally forgot about it when I went up to go to work that night.</p><p>With that out of the way, let&rsquo;s get into this&hellip;</p><p>I don&rsquo;t dislike Jon.  Not at all, but I also wouldn&rsquo;t go so far as to say i actively like him either.   I mean, sure, back when the show first started, i thought he was really pretty, which was reason enough.   Also the fact that he was a good, honorable man like his father (I don&rsquo;t care what his blood says, he&rsquo;s Eddard&rsquo;s son) was a mark in his favor.  But as this show has gone on, and as I&rsquo;ve grown up in the outside world, the less the whole &ldquo;being a good man&rdquo; became important.  </p><p>Being a good man, and being a good leader/ruler aren&rsquo;t not the same thing.   Jon is a great man, and even a great warrior, but when it comes to ruling, he kind of sucks.  Even when it comes to war, his entire area of expertise lies in the actual combat on the field.  He&rsquo;s not that great at strategic warfare and he relies too much on &ldquo;honorable combat&rdquo; to solve the problem.  An example of this is the Battle of Winterfell against the Bolton&rsquo;s forces.  I don&rsquo;t know if he actual expected Ramsay to decide the whole thing in single combat, but it&rsquo;s exactly that type of thinking, that expectation that other men should follow the same morals and principles he was raised with, that got his father and brother killed.</p><p>Not let&rsquo;s get to the crux of the matter, and don&rsquo;t think I didn&rsquo;t see you trying to disguise your distaste of Sansa behind your defense of Jon&hellip;</p><p>Sansa Stark.</p><p>I think the fact that so many people like to think that Sansa just wanted to be in control is a real disservice to the character and shows a real one-dimensional view of the show (ie. Sansa is a spoiled control-freak because to acknowledge her as a grown woman with realistic concerns  interferes with my dream of having Dany on the throne.)  I could point out how the true control freak here is Daenerys, which I guess I just did, but no one wants to listen to me.  Everything you just said to describe Sansa, being afraid of losing her power and wanting to be in control and killing those who oppose or threaten her, apply way more to Dany than they do to Sansa.  I don&rsquo;t know if it was Europe&rsquo;s hard-on for inherited mantles and crowns that has seeped down through the generations as &ldquo;the right way of doing it&rdquo;, but so many people just expect Sansa and the other Lords of the North to just roll over and show their bellies to Dany, as if the blood of their ancestors isn&rsquo;t in the very bedrock of the North.</p><p>But the fact of the matter is, the North, and particularly Sansa, don&rsquo;t owe Daenerys anything.  </p><p>They didn&rsquo;t ask for her army.  Jon didn&rsquo;t ask for her army.  He went to Dragonstone to collect the dragonglass to fight the Army of the Dead.  Dany actually agreed to help and pledged her army to defeat the Night King before Jon bent the knee.  He gave up the kingdom of his ancestors, the kingdom the other Northerners fought and died for, because he fell in love.

Sansa wasn&rsquo;t wrong when she asked about feeding Dany&rsquo;s army, because those are the real issues of war.  War isn&rsquo;t always epic battles and the feasts afterwards.   War is sieges and sacrifices and retreats when things are clearly not in your favor.  But everyone wants to paint Sansa as being irrational for voicing these rather pressing concerns while ignoring Dany&rsquo;s flippant attitude to the questions?</p><p>I mean, has Dany already forgotten what happened the last time she let her dragons eat &ldquo;whatever they want&rdquo;?  I&rsquo;m sure that&rsquo;s a perfect way to earn the North&rsquo;s trust, by letting her dragons and her Dothraki raid the countryside for food, because they didn&rsquo;t think to actually prepare for war in any capacity. </p><p>Everyone seems to forget that Sansa spent quite some time around some of the most ruthless and cunning people in Westeros.
