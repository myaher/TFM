Readmore provided because this got pretty dang long.</p><p>Let\u2019s start back in episode 31. Fjord\u2019s still recovering from being kidnapped and tortured by slavers; he\u2019s still dealing with losing Molly. During their time off, Fjord did not relax (\u201cThe previous events have rocked Fjord a little bit\u201d) and instead attempted to get his story out of the way without bothering the others. Did anyone ever talk to him about how he was gone for two weeks? As far as I can tell from the transcript, aside from Matt\u2019s comment that the others were \u201cgenerally worried\u201d that Fjord disappeared and a brief, skipped-over question from Caleb where he said \u201cYou were off on your own. Are you okay?\u201d left unanswered, they did not. One of the most painful moments for me, if it comes to that, is during a conversation where everyone\u2019s getting caught up on what they did during this time off, where Fjord asked everyone about their experiences and didn\u2019t speak at all about his own, he has this line [bolded part mine]:</p><blockquote><p>TRAVIS: Yeah. There\u2019s no telling that they\u2019re going to share any information with me, anyway. I\u2019m fucking absorbing things and shit just appears and I\u2019m getting stronger by the day and it has nothing to do with the things that I\u2019m learning. There\u2019s no books or knowledge, it\u2019s just happening. <b>What if they look at me like you guys look at me sometimes?</b> What if they don\u2019t let me go? Maybe that\u2019s not where I need to be.</p></blockquote><p>More on that - especially the bolded sentence - in a minute.</p><!-- more --><p>The other important thing about episode 31 was that Fjord was the one to go to Cree and talk to her about Molly, leading to the following conversation.</p><blockquote><p>MATT: I wasn\u2019t expecting to see him this last\ntime. I feel like whatever grace brought him back to us, maybe it was your carelessness that took\nhim from us again.</p><p>TRAVIS: Indeed, maybe it was. You have my\napologies and my condolences.</p><p>MATT: It is all right. I have started a new life\nhere, and it has been serving me well.</p><p>TRAVIS: I hate to leave you with such sour news,\nbut I must be going.</p><p>MATT: Such are these days. Thank you for your\ncandor. She turns around and walks away.</p><p>TRAVIS: Fuck. Then I\u2019ll head back to The Leaky\nTap.</p></blockquote><p>We already know that Fjord is someone who tends to\ntake on a lot of guilt, blame himself for things \u2013 Travis has said as much.\nFjord blames himself for Molly\u2019s death, and Cree outright blamed him, which I\u2019m\nsure didn\u2019t help. But this is just the setup. Just an example of Fjord, well,\nconforming to other people\u2019s opinions of him. This is a well-established fact\nabout his character. It\u2019s even symbolic, with his use of the Mask of Many\nFaces. Fjord can be who people want or expect him to be, shifting and changing to fit\ntheir expectations. Cree blamed him for Molly\u2019s death, and I think in that,\nFjord took on the persona of someone who was responsible for it.</p><p>Moving on to the current arc.</p><p>For a while now, Fjord has been pushed into this\nleadership position, into someone who makes decisions. He played a role for\nAvantika \u2013 the role of eager acolyte. He played a role for the Mighty Nein \u2013\nsomeone who was fine with all this, whose only goal was to get them through it,\nwho was fine with receiving the consequences of their entanglement with\nAvantika. This included sleeping with her twice \u2013 and the second time at least\nwith dubious consent (Beau outright said that he didn\u2019t really have a choice in\nthe matter). The overall tone of Fjord\u2019s actions in that section can be summed\nup with this exchange from episode 41:</p><blockquote><p>TRAVIS: Thank you and thank you for talking with\nme.</p><p>LIAM: I cough very hard into my hands and cast\nMessage to him and briefly, quietly say: I think that woman is going to try to kill you, I really\ndo.</p><p>TRAVIS: Yeah. Just so. I\u2019ll turn and walk off.</p></blockquote><p>In both sections here, I see a\u2026 resignation in\nFjord\u2019s attitude. An acceptance of <i>this\nis who he is now</i>. But even here, things aren\u2019t too bad. He sees himself as\na doomed man, but they make it out. Avantika is killed. All is well.</p><p>Except\u2026 it isn\u2019t.</p><p>In fact, Fjord\u2019s actions have taken a sharp turn\never since then \u2013 away from the kind, caring man we\u2019ve come to expect and into\nsomeone who seems to be making reckless decisions, hungers for power, doesn\u2019t care\nabout his friends\u2019 feelings.</p><p>And my argument is that this is happening because\nthey\u2019ve already decided that\u2019s how he is, now.</p><p><i>\u201cWhat if they look at me like you guys look at me sometimes?\u201d</i></p><p>When was the last time someone asked Fjord how he\nwas feeling? When was the last time someone had a conversation with him that wasn\u2019t\ncentered around Avantika or Uk\u2019otoa? When was the last time someone interacted\nwith him, one-on-one, without asking Fjord if he\u2019s power-hungry, asking him what\nhis goals are, wondering if he\u2019s going to release a monster bent on destroying\nthe world? A brief, one or two sentence conversation with Jester post-Darktow,\nmaybe, when she mentioned how he uses Vandren\u2019s voice (I would quote that but\nthe transcript hasn\u2019t been completed yet). Other than that, and the\nconversation with Caleb quoted above, no one\u2019s talked to Fjord in a long, long\ntime. And the last thing he said about how he was feeling \u2013 also from that\nconversation with Caleb?</p><p><i>\u201cBecause I\nfeel like I am swimming in the deep end and I don\u2019t quite know what I\u2019m doing.\u201d</i></p><p>Fjord finds it so easy to take on whatever persona\nhe needs to \u2013 whatever\u2019s expected of him. And his friends, consistently and constantly\nfor weeks now, have been on the lookout for him turning dark, or power-hungry,\nor cruel. Simultaneously, they\u2019ve expected leadership and initiative. They\u2019ve\nexpected him to be the one who knows what he\u2019s doing. Even Caleb \u2013 the only\nperson to really talk to him in so long \u2013 now expects Fjord to help him in the\nfuture, a pact sealed with blood and elemental magic. Everyone has come to\nexpect Fjord to take foolhardy risks, to be thinking about releasing Uk\u2019otoa,\nto be the Ship\u2019s Captain.</p><p>And, as we see, that\u2019s what Fjord\u2019s becoming.</p><p>He finds it so easy to take up a new character, a\nnew accent, a new face. For a long time, his friends expected him to be a kind\nand loving man, and he was. Now, don\u2019t get me wrong. I think that Fjord has a\ntrue nature of his own, and it is, at its core, <i>good</i>. \u00a0But for a character\nwho takes on so much of other people\u2019s expectations, weeks \u2013 months, even, now \u2013\nof taking on blame for things that are (for the most part) not his fault has\ngot to have an effect. This is why I say it\u2019s a self-fulfilling prophecy. Not\nthat Fjord\u2019s actively thinking \u201cwell, as long as they think this of me, I might\nas well act like they expect\u201d; I doubt it\u2019s conscious at all. With his friends\nwithdrawing from him, though, and them (and the fandom, by the way) acting as\nif he\u2019s <i>already</i> \u00a0given into his curiosity or his hunger for\npower or anything of that nature, he acts as he\u2019s expected to. Fjord likes\nfulfilling people\u2019s expectations, doesn\u2019t he?</p><p>No one really seems to trust him anymore. No one\nbothers to ask him how he feels \u2013 hasn\u2019t since he said he felt like he was swimming\nin the deep end, didn\u2019t know what he was doing. Since he responded to a\nsuggestion that he might be murdered with <i>just\nso</i>.</p><p>I don\u2019t know if this is an accurate read; I don\u2019t\nknow what\u2019s going to happen next.

Readmore provided because this got pretty dang long.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s start back in episode 31. Fjord&rsquo;s still recovering from being kidnapped and tortured by slavers; he&rsquo;s still dealing with losing Molly. During their time off, Fjord did not relax (&ldquo;The previous events have rocked Fjord a little bit&rdquo;) and instead attempted to get his story out of the way without bothering the others. Did anyone ever talk to him about how he was gone for two weeks? As far as I can tell from the transcript, aside from Matt&rsquo;s comment that the others were &ldquo;generally worried&rdquo; that Fjord disappeared and a brief, skipped-over question from Caleb where he said &ldquo;You were off on your own. Are you okay?&rdquo; left unanswered, they did not. One of the most painful moments for me, if it comes to that, is during a conversation where everyone&rsquo;s getting caught up on what they did during this time off, where Fjord asked everyone about their experiences and didn&rsquo;t speak at all about his own, he has this line [bolded part mine]:</p><blockquote><p>TRAVIS: Yeah. There&rsquo;s no telling that they&rsquo;re going to share any information with me, anyway. I&rsquo;m fucking absorbing things and shit just appears and I&rsquo;m getting stronger by the day and it has nothing to do with the things that I&rsquo;m learning. There&rsquo;s no books or knowledge, it&rsquo;s just happening. <b>What if they look at me like you guys look at me sometimes?</b> What if they don&rsquo;t let me go? Maybe that&rsquo;s not where I need to be.</p></blockquote><p>More on that - especially the bolded sentence - in a minute.</p><p>The other important thing about episode 31 was that Fjord was the one to go to Cree and talk to her about Molly, leading to the following conversation.</p><blockquote><p>MATT: I wasn&rsquo;t expecting to see him this last\ntime. I feel like whatever grace brought him back to us, maybe it was your carelessness that took\nhim from us again.</p><p>TRAVIS: Indeed, maybe it was. You have my\napologies and my condolences.</p><p>MATT: It is all right. I have started a new life\nhere, and it has been serving me well.</p><p>TRAVIS: I hate to leave you with such sour news,\nbut I must be going.</p><p>MATT: Such are these days. Thank you for your\ncandor. She turns around and walks away.</p><p>TRAVIS: Fuck. Then I&rsquo;ll head back to The Leaky\nTap.</p></blockquote><p>We already know that Fjord is someone who tends to\ntake on a lot of guilt, blame himself for things &ndash; Travis has said as much.\nFjord blames himself for Molly&rsquo;s death, and Cree outright blamed him, which I&rsquo;m\nsure didn&rsquo;t help. But this is just the setup. Just an example of Fjord, well,\nconforming to other people&rsquo;s opinions of him. This is a well-established fact\nabout his character. It&rsquo;s even symbolic, with his use of the Mask of Many\nFaces. Fjord can be who people want or expect him to be, shifting and changing to fit\ntheir expectations. Cree blamed him for Molly&rsquo;s death, and I think in that,\nFjord took on the persona of someone who was responsible for it.</p><p>Moving on to the current arc.</p><p>For a while now, Fjord has been pushed into this\nleadership position, into someone who makes decisions. He played a role for\nAvantika &ndash; the role of eager acolyte. He played a role for the Mighty Nein &ndash;\nsomeone who was fine with all this, whose only goal was to get them through it,\nwho was fine with receiving the consequences of their entanglement with\nAvantika. This included sleeping with her twice &ndash; and the second time at least\nwith dubious consent (Beau outright said that he didn&rsquo;t really have a choice in\nthe matter). The overall tone of Fjord&rsquo;s actions in that section can be summed\nup with this exchange from episode 41:</p><blockquote><p>TRAVIS: Thank you and thank you for talking with\nme.</p><p>LIAM: I cough very hard into my hands and cast\nMessage to him and briefly, quietly say: I think that woman is going to try to kill you, I really\ndo.</p><p>TRAVIS: Yeah. Just so. I&rsquo;ll turn and walk off.</p></blockquote><p>In both sections here, I see a&hellip; resignation in\nFjord&rsquo;s attitude. An acceptance of <i>this\nis who he is now</i>. But even here, things aren&rsquo;t too bad. He sees himself as\na doomed man, but they make it out. Avantika is killed. All is well.</p><p>Except&hellip; it isn&rsquo;t.</p><p>In fact, Fjord&rsquo;s actions have taken a sharp turn\never since then &ndash; away from the kind, caring man we&rsquo;ve come to expect and into\nsomeone who seems to be making reckless decisions, hungers for power, doesn&rsquo;t care\nabout his friends&rsquo; feelings.</p><p>And my argument is that this is happening because\nthey&rsquo;ve already decided that&rsquo;s how he is, now.</p><p><i>&ldquo;What if they look at me like you guys look at me sometimes?&rdquo;</i></p><p>When was the last time someone asked Fjord how he\nwas feeling? When was the last time someone had a conversation with him that wasn&rsquo;t\ncentered around Avantika or Uk&rsquo;otoa? When was the last time someone interacted\nwith him, one-on-one, without asking Fjord if he&rsquo;s power-hungry, asking him what\nhis goals are, wondering if he&rsquo;s going to release a monster bent on destroying\nthe world? A brief, one or two sentence conversation with Jester post-Darktow,\nmaybe, when she mentioned how he uses Vandren&rsquo;s voice (I would quote that but\nthe transcript hasn&rsquo;t been completed yet). Other than that, and the\nconversation with Caleb quoted above, no one&rsquo;s talked to Fjord in a long, long\ntime. And the last thing he said about how he was feeling &ndash; also from that\nconversation with Caleb?</p><p><i>&ldquo;Because I\nfeel like I am swimming in the deep end and I don&rsquo;t quite know what I&rsquo;m doing.&rdquo;</i></p><p>Fjord finds it so easy to take on whatever persona\nhe needs to &ndash; whatever&rsquo;s expected of him. And his friends, consistently and constantly\nfor weeks now, have been on the lookout for him turning dark, or power-hungry,\nor cruel. Simultaneously, they&rsquo;ve expected leadership and initiative. They&rsquo;ve\nexpected him to be the one who knows what he&rsquo;s doing. Even Caleb &ndash; the only\nperson to really talk to him in so long &ndash; now expects Fjord to help him in the\nfuture, a pact sealed with blood and elemental magic. Everyone has come to\nexpect Fjord to take foolhardy risks, to be thinking about releasing Uk&rsquo;otoa,\nto be the Ship&rsquo;s Captain.</p><p>And, as we see, that&rsquo;s what Fjord&rsquo;s becoming.</p><p>He finds it so easy to take up a new character, a\nnew accent, a new face. For a long time, his friends expected him to be a kind\nand loving man, and he was. Now, don&rsquo;t get me wrong. I think that Fjord has a\ntrue nature of his own, and it is, at its core, <i>good</i>. &nbsp;But for a character\nwho takes on so much of other people&rsquo;s expectations, weeks &ndash; months, even, now &ndash;\nof taking on blame for things that are (for the most part) not his fault has\ngot to have an effect. This is why I say it&rsquo;s a self-fulfilling prophecy. Not\nthat Fjord&rsquo;s actively thinking &ldquo;well, as long as they think this of me, I might\nas well act like they expect&rdquo;; I doubt it&rsquo;s conscious at all. With his friends\nwithdrawing from him, though, and them (and the fandom, by the way) acting as\nif he&rsquo;s <i>already</i> &nbsp;given into his curiosity or his hunger for\npower or anything of that nature, he acts as he&rsquo;s expected to. Fjord likes\nfulfilling people&rsquo;s expectations, doesn&rsquo;t he?</p><p>No one really seems to trust him anymore. No one\nbothers to ask him how he feels &ndash; hasn&rsquo;t since he said he felt like he was swimming\nin the deep end, didn&rsquo;t know what he was doing. Since he responded to a\nsuggestion that he might be murdered with <i>just\nso</i>.</p><p>I don&rsquo;t know if this is an accurate read; I don&rsquo;t\nknow what&rsquo;s going to happen next.
