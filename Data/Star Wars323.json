I\u2019ve been writing for Poe back to back so I\u2019ve hit a max with him! If you want something more message me!</b></i></p><p>You had never felt this way before. It was most likely due to the trauma you and the remaining Resistance had endured. You hadn\u2019t sleep in a while, along with the rest of the crew. The surviving pilots were just getting settled in the Millennium Falcon now, as Leia had passed out extra blankets that had been hidden somewhere. All the pilots except for your boyfriend, Poe Dameron. His multiple brushes with death only seemed to wake him up.</p><p>You glared over at him as he sunk deeper into his conversation with the Force using girl Rey. You bit the inside of your cheek and turned your head away with sparing another second. Never before had you been this jealous; but there you were, stewing in anger. Poe had hardly said four words to you since you had all escaped from The First Order\u2019s on Crait.</p><p>\u201cY/N, you need a blanket?\u201d You turned and looked up to find Finn, a blanket extended in his hand. </p><p>\u201cThanks, Finn,\u201d you said, quietly accepting the blanket. As you unfolded it, Finn sat down beside you. \u201cHow\u2019s Rose?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s stable, still not awake,\u201d Finn said sadly, looking over to the place where his friend was; her eyes still closed, her chest rising and falling steadily. </p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll wake up, Finn,\u201d you said, trying to comfort him as much as you could. </p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said, looking now towards Rey and Poe, \u201cit\u2019s good they\u2019re getting along. Have they been talking for very long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoe hasn\u2019t even looked over at me,\u201d you said, and Finn picked up on your anger, \u201cthey\u2019ve been taking since take off it seems.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s&hellip;good,\u201d Finn said, not knowing how to exactly handle your jealousy. \u201cRight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, it is,\u201d you said, \u201cbut it\u2019s like I\u2019m not even here.\u201d You watched as Rey laughed at something Poe said. BB8, who was resting at their feet, beeped loudly and shook his little head. Poe grinned at his droid, then at Rey as she recovered from his joke. While you watched them, Finn was looking at you, trying to figure out a way to help.</p><p>\u201cYou could go over there, I feel that Rey would really like you too.\u201d You glanced over at Finn when he spoke and you felt that little spark of angry sizzle out. It wasn\u2019t Rey you were angry at, you were jealous of her yes; but it was Poe you were angry with. </p><p>\u201cI need to cool off first, but I will soon,\u201d you said softly, \u201cthanks, Finn.\u201d You squeezed his shoulder and stood up to find a place where you could calm down before confronting Poe. </p><p>You found yourself wandering around the famous Millennium Falcon, wondering what stories were held in each wall panel and databases. There was so much history in this ship, and part of you wished you were on it under different circumstances. As you walked, you found a porthole that showed the stars in all their glory. The ship had exited hyperspeed, finally, and you felt a rush of relief overtake your body as you stared at the stars. You were all safe, for now.</p><p>\u201cThere you are, Finn said you wanted to talk to me at some point,\u201d you turned your head and saw Poe walking towards you. \u201cI\u2019ve missed you, Y/N.\u201d He reached out to wrap you in a hug, but you hardly moved to him. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t talked at all about what has happened. This was not a good day for us to disconnect and ignore each other.\u201d The words flowed out of your mouth before you could stop them. \u201cInstead of even asking if I\u2019m okay, you went to someone new and talked to her!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you jealous? I\u2019ve just met Rey, Y/N, can you blame me for wanting to learn about what\u2019s she\u2019s been through?! She literally lifted boulders for us!\u201d You clenched your jaw at his rising tone, trying to see his reasoning clearly; but you were so hurt. You missed him and he was right in front of you. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not even what\u2019s happening now, Poe! The Dreadnought?! You didn\u2019t listen to Leia, of all people. You\u2019re putting distance between those who want to help. What\u2019s going on in here?\u201d You reached up and gently rubbed through his dark curls. You met his dark brown eyes and saw that there was anguish in them, mixing with something that mirrored your own anger. </p><p>\u201cIf I knew, Y/N, I would tell you, but I don\u2019t!\u201d He moved his head away from your hand, \u201cbut maybe you should think about yourself. If you wanted to talk to me, you could\u2019ve come up to me! Do you know how strange it is to have your friend come up to you and tell you that your significant other is acting weird?!\u201d Poe took a breath, pinching the bridge of his nose, \u201cyou need to come talk to me about issues with us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d you whispered, not wanting to yell at him anymore, \u201cI will, next time. I\u2019m sorry, Poe.\u201d You felt tears in your eyes but pushed them down. Poe met your gaze and shook his head. He took a step towards you and pulled you to his chest. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said, pressing his lips to the crown of your head, \u201cI\u2019m sorry too. We need to work on this, the talking part. We lost that somewhere.\u201d You nodded against his chest and he stepped back to look into your eyes.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll find it again,\u201d you whispered, holding Poe\u2019s gaze, \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you more,\u201d Poe whispered, leaning down to press his lips to yours. His hands rested on your lower back, pulling your body closer to his. Your arms rested on his shoulders, wrapping around the back of his neck. At some point, the two of you broke apart before the kiss got any more heated. However, neither of you moved away.

I\u2019ve been writing for Poe back to back so I\u2019ve hit a max with him! If you want something more message me!</b></i></p><p>You had never felt this way before. It was most likely due to the trauma you and the remaining Resistance had endured. You hadn\u2019t sleep in a while, along with the rest of the crew. The surviving pilots were just getting settled in the Millennium Falcon now, as Leia had passed out extra blankets that had been hidden somewhere. All the pilots except for your boyfriend, Poe Dameron. His multiple brushes with death only seemed to wake him up.</p><p>You glared over at him as he sunk deeper into his conversation with the Force using girl Rey. You bit the inside of your cheek and turned your head away with sparing another second. Never before had you been this jealous; but there you were, stewing in anger. Poe had hardly said four words to you since you had all escaped from The First Order\u2019s on Crait.</p><p>\u201cY/N, you need a blanket?\u201d You turned and looked up to find Finn, a blanket extended in his hand. </p><p>\u201cThanks, Finn,\u201d you said, quietly accepting the blanket. As you unfolded it, Finn sat down beside you. \u201cHow\u2019s Rose?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s stable, still not awake,\u201d Finn said sadly, looking over to the place where his friend was; her eyes still closed, her chest rising and falling steadily. </p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll wake up, Finn,\u201d you said, trying to comfort him as much as you could. </p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said, looking now towards Rey and Poe, \u201cit\u2019s good they\u2019re getting along. Have they been talking for very long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoe hasn\u2019t even looked over at me,\u201d you said, and Finn picked up on your anger, \u201cthey\u2019ve been taking since take off it seems.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s\u2026good,\u201d Finn said, not knowing how to exactly handle your jealousy. \u201cRight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, it is,\u201d you said, \u201cbut it\u2019s like I\u2019m not even here.\u201d You watched as Rey laughed at something Poe said. BB8, who was resting at their feet, beeped loudly and shook his little head. Poe grinned at his droid, then at Rey as she recovered from his joke. While you watched them, Finn was looking at you, trying to figure out a way to help.</p><p>\u201cYou could go over there, I feel that Rey would really like you too.\u201d You glanced over at Finn when he spoke and you felt that little spark of angry sizzle out. It wasn\u2019t Rey you were angry at, you were jealous of her yes; but it was Poe you were angry with. </p><p>\u201cI need to cool off first, but I will soon,\u201d you said softly, \u201cthanks, Finn.\u201d You squeezed his shoulder and stood up to find a place where you could calm down before confronting Poe. </p><p>You found yourself wandering around the famous Millennium Falcon, wondering what stories were held in each wall panel and databases. There was so much history in this ship, and part of you wished you were on it under different circumstances. As you walked, you found a porthole that showed the stars in all their glory. The ship had exited hyperspeed, finally, and you felt a rush of relief overtake your body as you stared at the stars. You were all safe, for now.</p><p>\u201cThere you are, Finn said you wanted to talk to me at some point,\u201d you turned your head and saw Poe walking towards you. \u201cI\u2019ve missed you, Y/N.\u201d He reached out to wrap you in a hug, but you hardly moved to him. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t talked at all about what has happened. This was not a good day for us to disconnect and ignore each other.\u201d The words flowed out of your mouth before you could stop them. \u201cInstead of even asking if I\u2019m okay, you went to someone new and talked to her!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you jealous? I\u2019ve just met Rey, Y/N, can you blame me for wanting to learn about what\u2019s she\u2019s been through?! She literally lifted boulders for us!\u201d You clenched your jaw at his rising tone, trying to see his reasoning clearly; but you were so hurt. You missed him and he was right in front of you. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not even what\u2019s happening now, Poe! The Dreadnought?! You didn\u2019t listen to Leia, of all people. You\u2019re putting distance between those who want to help. What\u2019s going on in here?\u201d You reached up and gently rubbed through his dark curls. You met his dark brown eyes and saw that there was anguish in them, mixing with something that mirrored your own anger. </p><p>\u201cIf I knew, Y/N, I would tell you, but I don\u2019t!\u201d He moved his head away from your hand, \u201cbut maybe you should think about yourself. If you wanted to talk to me, you could\u2019ve come up to me! Do you know how strange it is to have your friend come up to you and tell you that your significant other is acting weird?!\u201d Poe took a breath, pinching the bridge of his nose, \u201cyou need to come talk to me about issues with us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d you whispered, not wanting to yell at him anymore, \u201cI will, next time. I\u2019m sorry, Poe.\u201d You felt tears in your eyes but pushed them down. Poe met your gaze and shook his head. He took a step towards you and pulled you to his chest. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said, pressing his lips to the crown of your head, \u201cI\u2019m sorry too. We need to work on this, the talking part. We lost that somewhere.\u201d You nodded against his chest and he stepped back to look into your eyes.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll find it again,\u201d you whispered, holding Poe\u2019s gaze, \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you more,\u201d Poe whispered, leaning down to press his lips to yours. His hands rested on your lower back, pulling your body closer to his. Your arms rested on his shoulders, wrapping around the back of his neck. At some point, the two of you broke apart before the kiss got any more heated. However, neither of you moved away. You stood in each other\u2019s arms, staring out the window and gazing at the stars. </p></p>",

Who knew Star Wars and Game of Thrones had so much in common?",

We all know the differences between the two, including the fact that was is geared toward young audiences and the other towards adult audiences. But they do share some important thematic elements, the most important of which is balance between opposing Forces or opposing Houses in GoT\u2019s case. What\u2019s more is that to achieve this balance a boy and a girl must come together in love. It\u2019s really beautiful. <br/></p><p>I also think that both stories have been clear about where they are headed and if you\u2019ve paid attention you\u2019ll be rewarded when having accurately deduce the outcome of these tails. They both play with fan expectation in that they are using the history of the series to confuse the outcome of the story. Some fans expect the story to head in certain direction because it has done that before, however, the story is telling you something else, even if you don\u2019t want to see it. You have to let go of what you expect should happen and see what\u2019s really happening. That can be hard. <br/></p><p>As for the fandoms, I have to be honest with you, Star Wars fandom is way more toxic that the Game of Thrones fandom. That probably has to do with the Star Wars fandom being larger and also older, in that Star Wars has been around for 40 years. It\u2019s hard to let go of how you see a character if you\u2019ve been a fan for that long. It\u2019s hard to accept change sometimes and that\u2019s true for everyone. <br/></p><p>TTFN<br/></p>",

Some fans expect the story to head in certain direction because it has done that before, however, the story is telling you something else, even if you don&rsquo;t want to see it. You have to let go of what you expect should happen and see what&rsquo;s really happening. That can be hard. <br /></p><p>As for the fandoms, I have to be honest with you, Star Wars fandom is way more toxic that the Game of Thrones fandom. That probably has to do with the Star Wars fandom being larger and also older, in that Star Wars has been around for 40 years. It&rsquo;s hard to let go of how you see a character if you&rsquo;ve been a fan for that long. It&rsquo;s hard to accept change sometimes and that&rsquo;s true for everyone. <br /></p><p>TTFN<br /></p>",

Truly, they brought out the worst\nin one another.</p><p>The stir they\u2019d caused in the upper levels left them\nreasonably free to seek passage to the wing they intended to break Kassandra\nout of; a few sharp bolts of lightning and a couple of slit throats quickly\nsilenced guards and prisoners alike who tried to make their way more difficult.\nThey felt invincible, and behaved as though they were.</p><!-- more --><p>When he finally saw her, Ulfran very nearly derailed their\nplans entirely. A snarl fixed upon his face and blue-tinged electricity\ncrackled once more at his fingertips; only to be cut short with a savage cry of\npain as Ahuska\u2019a\u2019s whip slashed against his hand. \u201cYou&mdash;!\u201d he seethed,\nrounding on her, only to be whipped again to the sound of an infuriating bark\nof laughter.</p><p>\u201cI saw that! Whatever business you have with her though,\ndoesn\u2019t matter now. You know why we need her.\u201d The Bothan sneered at the man,\nwho conceded her point but not without buffeting her back with the Force, just\nonce. Her expression snapped to a glower, as it always did when he used what\nwas, ultimately, a superior power against her, and she pushed past roughly to\nstare at the Chiss behind the containment field they now faced.</p><p>Kassandra stared up at the pair, not comprehending, a bubble\nof fear welling up in her chest.

He was a peculiarly eccentric\nBothan with a fondness for dark artifacts and an eagerness to ally with the\nSith Empire quite uncharacteristic of his species. That being so, it was an\neasy matter for Ulfran to find his way onto the Bothan\u2019s staff, and even easier\nto coax information from the him. Ulfran barely had to tickle his thoughts, so\nwilling was Hadrex to wax on Sith philosophy and include an actual, genuine\nSith in his plans.</p><p>As all self respecting Bothawui citizens did, Hadrex sought\npower. And the road to power he pursued was profoundly useful to Ulfran, as\nHadrex had a pact with the terribly wealthy and influential Ronan Ve\u2019lora after\nsaving his life in their youth. Ronan, claiming to be forever indebted to him,\npromised the hand of his first born in marriage to the Kor\u2019var line\u2026 but Ronan\nhad a single son, and Hadrex had only managed to sire sons himself. He was\ndesperate for a daughter. </p><p>It didn\u2019t take long for Ulfran to piece together the fact\nthat it wasn\u2019t just political power that Hadrex was vying for- he, too, was\nafter access to the Ve\u2019lora vaults. Possibly for the exact same artifact Ulfran\nwas. Suddenly his job was not just to secure the Shard; but to beat the\nunscrupulous, power-hungry Bothan to it.</p><p>Time was wearing on. If another year passed without a viable\nheir being produced, the Bothan Council would step in and nullify the pact, at\nno shame to the Ve\u2019loras, for the good of the family. Hadrex was running out of\ntime, and had begun seeking out less than legitimate ways to marry into the\nmore prestigious family. And Ulfran was helping him. Find a Bothan; somewhere,\nout in the galaxy. No records, no traceable lineage, preferably little to no\nattachments\u2026 falsify some DNA sampling, and present her as a long lost heir, a\nyouthful dalliance between Hadrex and household staff. The small burden of\nshame would be far outweighed by the benefit of taking on the Alora Clan name.</p><p>Ulfran, of course, saw this alliance as his way in to the\nfiercely protected Ve\u2019lora family vaults\u2026 until, he realised who the young\nBothan that Hadrex had discovered and set his sights on was.</p><p> For a man who\u2019d\nshrugged off so much throughout his life, who had faced torments and darkness\nwith his head held high, who\u2019d helped excuse all manner of deplorable things, oh,\nit had been a long time since he\u2019d felt such dread in the pit of his stomach.\nWhen he was shown the snippets of security footage sliced from a Mos Ila patrol\ndroid, when he saw the little blonde Bothan being shielded from blaster fire\nby\u2026 by <i>them</i>\u2026</p><figure data-orig-width=\"959\" data-orig-height=\"369\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/34b7cb92954deb0a2dcac30ddc8e3111/tumblr_inline_pbajgaLSd51r7lcd9_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"959\" data-orig-height=\"369\"/></figure><p>\u201cI beg you, my Lord,\u201d Ulfran tried to keep his voice level\nas he pleaded with Hadrex, wincing inwardly at having to refer to him as such. \u201cDon\u2019t\npursue this.

Still, if he performed the job neatly enough,\nperhaps he could still see this through. Find the girl, have her marry, get in\nthe good graces of the Ve\u2019lora family and access their collection\u2026 and be gone,\nbefore Lyrisal\u2019s damned crew inevitably discovered the truth and came\nsearching.

He was a peculiarly eccentric\nBothan with a fondness for dark artifacts and an eagerness to ally with the\nSith Empire quite uncharacteristic of his species. That being so, it was an\neasy matter for Ulfran to find his way onto the Bothan\u2019s staff, and even easier\nto coax information from the him. Ulfran barely had to tickle his thoughts, so\nwilling was Hadrex to wax on Sith philosophy and include an actual, genuine\nSith in his plans.</p><p>As all self respecting Bothawui citizens did, Hadrex sought\npower. And the road to power he pursued was profoundly useful to Ulfran, as\nHadrex had a pact with the terribly wealthy and influential Ronan Ve\u2019lora after\nsaving his life in their youth. Ronan, claiming to be forever indebted to him,\npromised the hand of his first born in marriage to the Kor\u2019var line\u2026 but Ronan\nhad a single son, and Hadrex had only managed to sire sons himself. He was\ndesperate for a daughter. </p><p>It didn\u2019t take long for Ulfran to piece together the fact\nthat it wasn\u2019t just political power that Hadrex was vying for- he, too, was\nafter access to the Ve\u2019lora vaults. Possibly for the exact same artifact Ulfran\nwas. Suddenly his job was not just to secure the Shard; but to beat the\nunscrupulous, power-hungry Bothan to it.</p><p>Time was wearing on. If another year passed without a viable\nheir being produced, the Bothan Council would step in and nullify the pact, at\nno shame to the Ve\u2019loras, for the good of the family. Hadrex was running out of\ntime, and had begun seeking out less than legitimate ways to marry into the\nmore prestigious family. And Ulfran was helping him. Find a Bothan; somewhere,\nout in the galaxy. No records, no traceable lineage, preferably little to no\nattachments\u2026 falsify some DNA sampling, and present her as a long lost heir, a\nyouthful dalliance between Hadrex and household staff. The small burden of\nshame would be far outweighed by the benefit of taking on the Alora Clan name.</p><p>Ulfran, of course, saw this alliance as his way in to the\nfiercely protected Ve\u2019lora family vaults\u2026 until, he realised who the young\nBothan that Hadrex had discovered and set his sights on was.</p><p> For a man who\u2019d\nshrugged off so much throughout his life, who had faced torments and darkness\nwith his head held high, who\u2019d helped excuse all manner of deplorable things, oh,\nit had been a long time since he\u2019d felt such dread in the pit of his stomach.\nWhen he was shown the snippets of security footage sliced from a Mos Ila patrol\ndroid, when he saw the little blonde Bothan being shielded from blaster fire\nby\u2026 by <i>them</i>\u2026</p><figure data-orig-width=\"959\" data-orig-height=\"369\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/34b7cb92954deb0a2dcac30ddc8e3111/tumblr_inline_pbajgaLSd51r7lcd9_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"959\" data-orig-height=\"369\"></figure><p>\u201cI beg you, my Lord,\u201d Ulfran tried to keep his voice level\nas he pleaded with Hadrex, wincing inwardly at having to refer to him as such. \u201cDon\u2019t\npursue this. This target will only bring trouble.\u201d</p><p>SMACK.</p><p>Hadrex\u2019s gloved hand backhanded Ulfran across the face, as\nhe responded with a snarl. \u201cNot if you do your job right, Sith. I don\u2019t pay you\nfor your <i>opinions</i>\u2026\u201d</p><p>Ulfran stepped slowly out of reach, and kept his flashing eyes\naverted. \u201cBut my counsel is not unfounded. I <i>know </i>who you\u2019re about to cross, and if she is anything like the\nrest of them\u2026 there\u2019s a reason we wanted minimal attachments\u2026\u201d he was cut short\nby another advance from the dark furred Bothan noble, the threat of another slap.</p><p>\u201cSo do not cross them! Make them believe there is no hope, I\nknow you are capable of that. I want this girl, and you will deliver her to me <i>posthaste</i>.\u201d</p><p>That wasn\u2019t the only time he\u2019d tried to persuade Hadrex to\nanother course of action, but the Lord would have none of it, having become\nutterly fixated on Ahuska. Still, if he performed the job neatly enough,\nperhaps he could still see this through. Find the girl, have her marry, get in\nthe good graces of the Ve\u2019lora family and access their collection\u2026 and be gone,\nbefore Lyrisal\u2019s damned crew inevitably discovered the truth and came\nsearching. Perhaps he could avoid their wrath.</p><p>But he did not perform his job neatly at all.</p><p>He vastly underestimated the strength of Crow\u2019s mind, when\nhe tracked the Bounty Hunter down and tried to pull enough information from his\nhead to pre-empt his and Ahuska\u2019s future movements. No subtle in-and-out from\nthe shadows; no, Crow had picked up on Ulfran\u2019s presence near immediately, and the\ntwo men had locked in physical battle. Ulfran had staggered away less two\nfingers and a thumb, half burned, his own memories a shambles, mixed with what\nthoughts he had managed to pluck from Crow\u2019s head\u2026 but most dangerous was the\nfact that he had entirely, completely made himself known.</p><p>Ulfran knew his time was limited.</p><p>He discovered, in Crow\u2019s stolen thoughts, Ahuska\u2019s desire to\nvisit Lothal. He took a gamble and beat them there, where he began to lay down\nhis plan. It wasn\u2019t enough to simply kidnap her; the Deserters would be on his\ntrail in a heartbeat. He had to fake her death, he had to make them truly\nbelieve she was gone\u2014and against all odds, he succeeded.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"795\" data-orig-height=\"231\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/c65b9d2e595edb44ee2e29abb6fb8815/tumblr_inline_pbajjgKEVw1r7lcd9_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"795\" data-orig-height=\"231\"></figure><p>Crow sat in the dew soaked grass, his back against one of\nthe sheer, towering rocks that jutted skyward from the ground. He toyed with\nhis blaster, passing it back and forth between his hands, as casual as someone\nmulling over what to have for dinner, but his gaze was locked out toward the\nhorizon. His flat, grey gaze. The hot spark of life that burned so brightly\nbehind his eyes had been extinguished.</p><p>Ahuska was gone.</p><p><i>\u2018I don\u2019t want to see\nDad like this again,\u2019 Nela keened. <br>\u2018I know.

He had broken Crow\u2019s spirit, and if not for his friends and his\ndaughter, if not for Nela insisting something was wrong, the bounty hunter may never have left\nthe plains of Lothal. He had assisted Hadrex in his lies and his forgery, he\nhad convinced poor young Kovar Ve\u2019lora that Ahuska would be a most exceptional\nwife. That he would be happy with her, and eventually, she with him. He had\nthreatened Ahuska into compliance, and though he\u2019d told himself repeatedly he\nwould never actually follow through, that he would never truly make her forget\nthe one she loved\u2026 he had it in him.

The small burden of\nshame would be far outweighed by the benefit of taking on the Alora Clan name.</p><p>Ulfran, of course, saw this alliance as his way in to the\nfiercely protected Ve&rsquo;lora family vaults&hellip; until, he realised who the young\nBothan that Hadrex had discovered and set his sights on was.</p><p> For a man who&rsquo;d\nshrugged off so much throughout his life, who had faced torments and darkness\nwith his head held high, who&rsquo;d helped excuse all manner of deplorable things, oh,\nit had been a long time since he&rsquo;d felt such dread in the pit of his stomach.\nWhen he was shown the snippets of security footage sliced from a Mos Ila patrol\ndroid, when he saw the little blonde Bothan being shielded from blaster fire\nby&hellip; by <i>them</i>&hellip;</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/34b7cb92954deb0a2dcac30ddc8e3111/tumblr_inline_pbajgaLSd51r7lcd9_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>&ldquo;I beg you, my Lord,&rdquo; Ulfran tried to keep his voice level\nas he pleaded with Hadrex, wincing inwardly at having to refer to him as such. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t\npursue this. This target will only bring trouble.&rdquo;</p><p>SMACK.</p><p>Hadrex&rsquo;s gloved hand backhanded Ulfran across the face, as\nhe responded with a snarl. &ldquo;Not if you do your job right, Sith. I don&rsquo;t pay you\nfor your <i>opinions</i>&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Ulfran stepped slowly out of reach, and kept his flashing eyes\naverted. &ldquo;But my counsel is not unfounded. I <i>know </i>who you&rsquo;re about to cross, and if she is anything like the\nrest of them&hellip; there&rsquo;s a reason we wanted minimal attachments&hellip;&rdquo; he was cut short\nby another advance from the dark furred Bothan noble, the threat of another slap.</p><p>&ldquo;So do not cross them! Make them believe there is no hope, I\nknow you are capable of that. I want this girl, and you will deliver her to me <i>posthaste</i>.&rdquo;</p><p>That wasn&rsquo;t the only time he&rsquo;d tried to persuade Hadrex to\nanother course of action, but the Lord would have none of it, having become\nutterly fixated on Ahuska. Still, if he performed the job neatly enough,\nperhaps he could still see this through. Find the girl, have her marry, get in\nthe good graces of the Ve&rsquo;lora family and access their collection&hellip; and be gone,\nbefore Lyrisal&rsquo;s damned crew inevitably discovered the truth and came\nsearching. Perhaps he could avoid their wrath.</p><p>But he did not perform his job neatly at all.</p><p>He vastly underestimated the strength of Crow&rsquo;s mind, when\nhe tracked the Bounty Hunter down and tried to pull enough information from his\nhead to pre-empt his and Ahuska&rsquo;s future movements. No subtle in-and-out from\nthe shadows; no, Crow had picked up on Ulfran&rsquo;s presence near immediately, and the\ntwo men had locked in physical battle. Ulfran had staggered away less two\nfingers and a thumb, half burned, his own memories a shambles, mixed with what\nthoughts he had managed to pluck from Crow&rsquo;s head&hellip; but most dangerous was the\nfact that he had entirely, completely made himself known.</p><p>Ulfran knew his time was limited.</p><p>He discovered, in Crow&rsquo;s stolen thoughts, Ahuska&rsquo;s desire to\nvisit Lothal. He took a gamble and beat them there, where he began to lay down\nhis plan. It wasn&rsquo;t enough to simply kidnap her; the Deserters would be on his\ntrail in a heartbeat. He had to fake her death, he had to make them truly\nbelieve she was gone&mdash;and against all odds, he succeeded.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/c65b9d2e595edb44ee2e29abb6fb8815/tumblr_inline_pbajjgKEVw1r7lcd9_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Crow sat in the dew soaked grass, his back against one of\nthe sheer, towering rocks that jutted skyward from the ground. He toyed with\nhis blaster, passing it back and forth between his hands, as casual as someone\nmulling over what to have for dinner, but his gaze was locked out toward the\nhorizon. His flat, grey gaze. The hot spark of life that burned so brightly\nbehind his eyes had been extinguished.</p><p>Ahuska was gone.</p><p><i>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t want to see\nDad like this again,&rsquo; Nela keened. <br />&lsquo;I know. I&rsquo;m sorry.&rsquo; And Ulfran meant it.</i></p><p>He had taken Ahuska, and she had resisted savagely every\nwaking minute. He had broken Crow&rsquo;s spirit, and if not for his friends and his\ndaughter, if not for Nela insisting something was wrong, the bounty hunter may never have left\nthe plains of Lothal. He had assisted Hadrex in his lies and his forgery, he\nhad convinced poor young Kovar Ve&rsquo;lora that Ahuska would be a most exceptional\nwife. That he would be happy with her, and eventually, she with him. He had\nthreatened Ahuska into compliance, and though he&rsquo;d told himself repeatedly he\nwould never actually follow through, that he would never truly make her forget\nthe one she loved&hellip; he had it in him. Ulfran forced himself to acknowledge just\nhow far he might have gone. Eyes locked so firmly on his job, on his end goal,\nthe people he harmed along the way had begun to matter less and less. He agonized\nover the terrible things he did to meet his ends, but did them anyway, so what\nwas the purpose of his self-torment? What good was his conscience, if he did <i>those things anyway</i>?</p><p><i>&lsquo;If you didn&rsquo;t feel\nthat way, you&rsquo;d be someone different. You&rsquo;d be the other one. It&rsquo;s okay. We\nfound you in time.&rsquo;</i></p><p><i>&mdash;-</i></p><p>Phewwww I&rsquo;m getting so close to the end now! It&rsquo;s weirdly challenging trying to summarise months and months of RP in a few paragraphs; I could carry on forever if I let myself!
