NYU. You had made it. </p><p>You were from London originally, but it was your dream to study in New York and you had finally worked your ass off and got a scholarship. You had no friends or family in New York, but you had a dorm on campus. </p><p>You started to unpack, putting up posters with Blu-Tac and putting books onto the shelf above your bed. You put your own bedding onto the bed, and put your laptop onto the desk along with all your folders. It was only when you turned around that you noticed the other half of the room.</p><p>You had signed up for a roommate, figuring it was an easy way to make a friend, and clearly she had already moved in. There was a Star Wars poster on the wall. Clothes were spread on the bed - sweaters and jeans. A backpack lay forgotten at the foot of the bed. The desk was covered in books and folders. You glanced at them. </p><p>Peter Parker, read the handwritten labels.</p><p>Was your new roommate a boy?</p><p>You called Alexandra, your best friend from London. </p><p>\u2018Y/N! How is it?\u2019</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s amazing. It\u2019s so pretty, and it\u2019s right next to Washington Square Park, and&hellip;\u2019 you gushed about the university. </p><p>\u2018Wow! So, you met any cute American boys yet?\u2019</p><p>You snorted. \u2018Alex, I\u2019ve literally just stepped foot into my dorm. I haven\u2019t even met my roommate yet!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Ooh, who\u2019s she?\u2019</p><p>\u2018He,\u2019 you said. \u2018His name\u2019s Peter. He\u2019s&hellip; Messy.\u2019 </p><p>Alex laughed. \u2018Of course miss clean freak gets stuck with a messy roommate. Also, a boy!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Calm down, Alex. He could be a terrible person for all I know, alright? I\u2019m gonna go explore, but I\u2019ll call you later.\u2019 </p><p>You ended the call. Just as you were about to leave the dorm room, the window opened. A boy jumped through, wearing a big old yellow coat and sweatpants. His shoes were bright red and blue, peeking out from under his coat. The boy froze.</p><p>\u2018Oh! Um, you must be Y/N. I\u2019m Peter,\u2019 said the boy. </p><p>You laughed nervously. \u2018So, um, what\u2019s with the outfit?\u2019 you asked. \u2018And the, uh, the window?\u2019</p><p>There was utter silence. Peter swallowed. </p><p>\u2018So\u2026\u2019 he rubbed the back of his neck awkwardly. \u2018You know Spider-Man?\u2019</p><!-- more --><p>You had been a super-fan of Spider-Man since he first appeared, but you weren\u2019t about to tell Peter about the hours spent nagging your parents to drop you off in Queens so you could stalk him. Spider-Man, that is, not Peter.</p><p>\u2018Yeah, I know him. What about him?\u2019 you tilted your head. Peter wouldn\u2019t meet your eyes.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m- uh, I mean- I\u2019m\u2026\u2019 he stopped and took a deep breath. \u2018I\u2019m part of a fanclub,\u2019 he blurted out. \u2018A Spider-Man fanclub. We meet in Washington Square Park once a week, and we\u2026 we cosplay and stuff.\u2019</p><p>Peter unzipped his coat to reveal a Spider-Man suit. Damn, the guy had muscles. You looked up to meet his eyes. </p><p>\u2018Why did you come in through the window?\u2019 you asked. </p><p>\u2018Authenticity,\u2019 he replied instantly. </p><p>\u2018Wow, you\u2019re a nerd,\u2019 you snorted. </p><p>\u2018And you didn\u2019t get that from the Star Wars poster?\u2019 Peter grinned. </p><p>\u2018Fair,\u2019 you smiled at him. \u2018I\u2019m going out, I\u2019ll see you later.\u2019</p><p>You paused at the door before winking and adding, \u2018Spider-Man.\u2019</p><p>Peter stood, frozen, staring at the door. He didn\u2019t think his roommate would arrive until later. And now he had lied to her. It would have been easier if he had just said he was Spider-Man. She probably wouldn\u2019t have believed him anyway. Still, the fanclub thing was a good cover. Right?</p><p>You arrived back late. Peter was sitting on his bed, watching something on his laptop. </p><p>\u2018What\u2019cha watching?\u2019 you asked. He jumped.</p><p>\u2018Oh, uh, just a movie.\u2019</p><p>\u2018What movie?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Alien,\u2019 he replied. \u2018It\u2019s- uh, I\u2019ve seen it a bunch of times but I love it.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ve never seen that,\u2019 you replied.</p><p>\u2018You haven\u2019t?\u2019 his eyes widened. \u2018Hey, uh, sit down!\u2019 </p><p>You sat next to him on the bed. He was blushing as he unpaused the movie.</p><p>You woke up. It was past midnight. You were in your own bed, still fully dressed. You put two and two together and realised that Peter must have moved you when you fell asleep. Peter was on his own bed, deep in concentration. He was scribbling in a notebook and stirring some kind of liquid. He poured the liquid into a tiny capsule and slid it into something on his wrist. He aimed at the ceiling. A long string of white fluid sprayed from his wrist and stuck to the ceiling, like\u2026 Like a spider\u2019s web. </p><p>You rolled over and went back to sleep.</p><p>You and Peter became friends quickly, even though he was always disappearing. He said it was for debate club, chess club and the Spider-Man fanclub. Once or twice you had asked to join the fanclub. He had blushed deeply and said that it was \u2018an all-male fanclub\u2019. You had rolled your eyes and given up. You watched a movie together almost every night. Sometimes Peter invited Ned, one of his friends from high school, over to your dorm. Peter had given no indication that he had a girlfriend. Or, for that matter, any friends other than Ned. All your friends were back in England, so you were grateful for Ned coming over. You and Ned hung out without Peter if Peter disappeared. </p><p>It was a Friday night. You had finished an essay for English lit, and you were hanging out, watching Roman Holiday with Ned. </p><p>\u2018You\u2019re single, right?\u2019 asked Ned suddenly. </p><p>\u2018You asking me out?\u2019 you joked. \u2018But yeah, I am.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Not asking you out,\u2019 Ned grinned with a laugh. \u2018Just wondering.\u2019</p><p>The days spun by, and soon it was half-term. You were staying in the dorm for the week, excited for a chance to actually hang out in New York without having to worry about work. You had a job in a caf\u00e9 and plans to explore the city. </p><p>You were finishing off your week\u2019s assignment, the only work you had due for after the half-term, when the window opened. This was a regular occurrence at this point - Peter used the window more than the door. His footsteps landed heavily on the floor.</p><p>\u2018Hey, Peter,\u2019 you greeted, not looking up. Peter said nothing. His breath was coming out in short gasps. You looked up.</p><p>Peter, still in his Spider-Man suit, was bleeding. His entire side had been slashed, and the blood was coming out in sheets. Your brain flooded with blind panic.</p><p>\u2018Fuck!\u2019 you yelled. \u2018Peter, what the hell?\u2019 </p><p>You grabbed your phone.</p><p>\u2018No,\u2019 slurred Peter. \u2018Don\u2019t call Ambl\u2026. ambu\u2026.ambulance, call May\u2026\u2019</p><p>You grabbed Peter\u2019s phone and pressed on his aunt\u2019s number, which was at the top of his emergency contacts. </p><p>\u2018May?\u2019 you snapped. \u2018Is this Peter\u2019s aunt? I\u2019m Y/N, Peter\u2019s roommate. He\u2019s been stabbed.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ll be right there,\u2019 May\u2019s voice was calm, even, and didn\u2019t sound even remotely shocked. \u2018Keep talking to him. Ask him what happened, his name, birthday, what he had for breakfast, anything. Keep him conscious. Apply pressure to the wound, try and slow the bleeding.\u2019</p><p>She hung up. </p><p>\u2018Peter, what happened?\u2019 you asked.</p><p>\u2018Car thief,\u2019 Peter\u2019s voice was soft and tired. \u2018Knife. I tried to web him, and he lashed out.\u2019</p><p>\u2018What?\u2019 you frowned. \u2018Peter, what happened to fanclub? Where were you? Why were you trying to\u2026 web him?\u2019</p><p>The pieces clicked together.</p><p>Peter coming in through the window, dressed as Spider-Man.</p><p>The all-male fanclub that you weren\u2019t allowed to join.</p><p>The time you had woken up and seen him experimenting with that white goop.</p><p>Peter was Spider-Man.</p><p>\u2018Oh, yeah,\u2019 Peter slurred. \u2018I forgot you didn\u2019t know\u2026 I\u2019m Spider- Spider-Man.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Okay, good to, good to know,\u2019 you stuttered. You asked him a few basic questions, and then there was a knock on the door.</p><p>Peter\u2019s Aunt May stood, armed with a first-aid kit and a steely expression. She strode over to Peter, lying on the floor.</p><p>\u2018Whassup, May?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Don\u2019t \u2018whassup\u2019 me, Peter,\u2019 May sighed. She grabbed some rubbing alcohol and bandages. \u2018If we can slow the bleeding, your body will take care of the rest.\u2019 </p><p>\u2018Y/N,\u2019 murmured Peter. </p><p>\u2018Yeah?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Sorry for wrecking your carpet,\u2019 he slurred. You realised he had bled all over your white rug.</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s alright, Peter,\u2019 you shook your head with a smile. </p><p>Time sped by. Now that you knew Peter\u2019s secret, the two of you had grown even closer. You watched countless movies, went shopping for dorm stuff, and helped each other study. </p><p>You had by now accepted the fact that you had a crush on him. </p><p>But you were fine. He didn\u2019t like you back - why would he? None of your other crushes ever had, so why would this one be any different? It was a crush, that\u2019s all. And crushes pass.</p><p>But this felt different. Whenever he wasn\u2019t around, you found yourself looking over to see his reaction to something you said, before realising he wasn&rsquo;t there. You remembered little details - the name of his childhood pet, his favourite movie, his dad\u2019s name. </p><p>It was your second semester of the year. You were sitting on your bed, typing an essay. You heard the window open. Peter\u2019s footsteps landed heavily on the ground.</p><p>\u2018Hey, Peter, how was patrol?\u2019 </p><p>\u2018It was - yeah,\u2019 Peter sighed. You heard him hiss as he took off his mask, and you looked up. </p><p>Peter\u2019s face was bleeding. </p><p>\u2018Shit, Peter, not again,\u2019 you got up and grabbed the first-aid kit. \u2018You\u2019ve gotta be more careful.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Can\u2019t help it,\u2019 he mumbled. \u2018They came from behind. Swiss army knife.\u2019</p><p>You took a deep breath, cleaning Peter\u2019s wound. \u2018Peter, it- it stresses me out, okay? When you leave, and I don\u2019t know when you\u2019ll be back, or if you\u2019ll be okay, or\u2026\u2019</p><p>\u2018Really?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yeah, Peter. I\u2019m worried about you.\u2019</p><p>Peter\u2019s expression stiffened. \u2018I can take care of myself, you know.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I know that, Peter, I just\u2026 I get scared.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Well, you don\u2019t need to get scared, alright? I\u2019m fine. I\u2019m an adult.\u2019</p><p>\u2018And yet I\u2019m the one that takes care of your wounds.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I never asked you to help.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Peter, you came home and fucking bled out on my floor, okay? You need my help.\u2019</p><p>\u2018No,\u2019 Peter stood up just as you placed a plaster on his cut. \u2018I don\u2019t need your help, Y/N. And I don\u2019t fucking want it, either.\u2019</p><p>You felt shaky. Like you were about to cry. \u2018Good luck cleaning your wounds when you\u2019re unconscious, Parker.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Like I said, I\u2019m an adult,\u2019 Peter was at the door now. \u2018I can take care of my own fucking wounds.\u2019</p><p>You felt a tear slip down your face. \u2018Peter, I -\u2019 your voice cracked. </p><p>Peter turned to face you, looking surprised.</p><p>\u2018What?\u2019 he asked.</p><p>\u2018You go out every night, okay? And I never know if you\u2019re gonna come back with a stab wound or a bullet wound. And I get so - so fucking scared every time you leave. And\u2026 I just- You know what the worst part is? Sometimes you\u2019re a fucking asshole, okay? But the worst part is\u2026 I just\u2026 I love you anyway.\u2019</p><p>Peter froze. You realised what you had just said. Peter\u2019s eyes lit up with\u2026 something? </p><p>\u2018I - I mean, as- as a friend,\u2019 you stuttered, laughing it off.</p><p>Peter\u2019s face fell slightly. \u2018I- I have to go.\u2019</p><p>Ten minutes later, your phone buzzed. </p><p><b>Ned: y/n what the hell did you do to peter</b></p><p><b>You: nothing what\u2019s wrong?</b></p><p><b>Ned: he\u2019s crying his eyes out</b></p><p><b>You: what? I\u2019m coming over</b></p><p><b>Ned: no dont he just asked me not to invite you over</b></p><p><b>You: has he said anything</b></p><p><b>Ned: he said you had said that you loved him as a friend</b></p><p><b>Ned: oh shit he just said not to tell you any of this</b></p><p><b>Ned: he just said he loves you</b></p><p><b>Ned: as more than a friend</b></p><p><b>You: what??? Holy shit</b></p><p><b>You: tell him i said i like him back</b></p><p><b>Ned: WHAT? YOU DO?</b></p><p><b>Ned: why\u2019d you say you only loved him as a friend</b></p><p><b>You: i didn\u2019t think he felt the same way</b></p><p><b>Ned: i\u2019m telling him to go back to the dorm room</b></p><p><b>Ned: he\u2019s on his way to the dorm now</b></p><p>You slumped on your bed, utterly confused. Peter was crying? Because of you? And he\u2026. Loved you? No. That - Ned had made a mistake.</p><p>There was a soft knock on the door. </p><p>\u2018Y/N?\u2019 asked Peter. \u2018Can I - come in?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Sure,\u2019 you replied. Peter walked in. \u2018Ned told me what you said,\u2019 you told him. Peter froze. His eyes were still blotchy. He swallowed.</p><p>\u2018Uh, what- what did I say?\u2019</p><p>\u2018That, you- that you, uh, that\u2026 That you loved me.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh,\u2019 Peter laughed bitterly, looking down. \u2018That.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Peter, it\u2019s-\u2019</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s nothing. You don\u2019t feel the same way. Can we still be friends?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Peter, I-\u2019</p><p>\u2018Y/N, it\u2019s fine. Can we drop it?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Peter, I do feel the same way.\u2019</p><p>Peter was in the middle of hanging his coat up on the door. The coat slipped from his fingers and landed on the floor.</p><p>\u2018You- what?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I didn\u2019t tell you because I didn\u2019t think you felt the same way. I said that I loved you, you looked surprised, so I lied and said it was just as a friend. Peter, I love you, alright? No matter how many times you get stabbed.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I love you too, Y/N.\u2019</p>",

NYU. You had made it. </p><p>You were from London originally, but it was your dream to study in New York and you had finally worked your ass off and got a scholarship. You had no friends or family in New York, but you had a dorm on campus. </p><p>You started to unpack, putting up posters with Blu-Tac and putting books onto the shelf above your bed. You put your own bedding onto the bed, and put your laptop onto the desk along with all your folders. It was only when you turned around that you noticed the other half of the room.</p><p>You had signed up for a roommate, figuring it was an easy way to make a friend, and clearly she had already moved in. There was a Star Wars poster on the wall. Clothes were spread on the bed - sweaters and jeans. A backpack lay forgotten at the foot of the bed. The desk was covered in books and folders. You glanced at them. </p><p>Peter Parker, read the handwritten labels.</p><p>Was your new roommate a boy?</p><p>You called Alexandra, your best friend from London. </p><p>\u2018Y/N! How is it?\u2019</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s amazing. It\u2019s so pretty, and it\u2019s right next to Washington Square Park, and\u2026\u2019 you gushed about the university. </p><p>\u2018Wow! So, you met any cute American boys yet?\u2019</p><p>You snorted. \u2018Alex, I\u2019ve literally just stepped foot into my dorm. I haven\u2019t even met my roommate yet!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Ooh, who\u2019s she?\u2019</p><p>\u2018He,\u2019 you said. \u2018His name\u2019s Peter. He\u2019s\u2026 Messy.\u2019 </p><p>Alex laughed. \u2018Of course miss clean freak gets stuck with a messy roommate. Also, a boy!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Calm down, Alex. He could be a terrible person for all I know, alright? I\u2019m gonna go explore, but I\u2019ll call you later.\u2019 </p><p>You ended the call. Just as you were about to leave the dorm room, the window opened. A boy jumped through, wearing a big old yellow coat and sweatpants. His shoes were bright red and blue, peeking out from under his coat. The boy froze.</p><p>\u2018Oh! Um, you must be Y/N. I\u2019m Peter,\u2019 said the boy. </p><p>You laughed nervously. \u2018So, um, what\u2019s with the outfit?\u2019 you asked. \u2018And the, uh, the window?\u2019</p><p>There was utter silence. Peter swallowed. </p><p>\u2018So\u2026\u2019 he rubbed the back of his neck awkwardly. \u2018You know Spider-Man?\u2019</p>[[MORE]]<p>You had been a super-fan of Spider-Man since he first appeared, but you weren\u2019t about to tell Peter about the hours spent nagging your parents to drop you off in Queens so you could stalk him. Spider-Man, that is, not Peter.</p><p>\u2018Yeah, I know him. What about him?\u2019 you tilted your head. Peter wouldn\u2019t meet your eyes.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m- uh, I mean- I\u2019m\u2026\u2019 he stopped and took a deep breath. \u2018I\u2019m part of a fanclub,\u2019 he blurted out. \u2018A Spider-Man fanclub. We meet in Washington Square Park once a week, and we\u2026 we cosplay and stuff.\u2019</p><p>Peter unzipped his coat to reveal a Spider-Man suit. Damn, the guy had muscles. You looked up to meet his eyes. </p><p>\u2018Why did you come in through the window?\u2019 you asked. </p><p>\u2018Authenticity,\u2019 he replied instantly. </p><p>\u2018Wow, you\u2019re a nerd,\u2019 you snorted. </p><p>\u2018And you didn\u2019t get that from the Star Wars poster?\u2019 Peter grinned. </p><p>\u2018Fair,\u2019 you smiled at him. \u2018I\u2019m going out, I\u2019ll see you later.\u2019</p><p>You paused at the door before winking and adding, \u2018Spider-Man.\u2019</p><p>Peter stood, frozen, staring at the door. He didn\u2019t think his roommate would arrive until later. And now he had lied to her. It would have been easier if he had just said he was Spider-Man. She probably wouldn\u2019t have believed him anyway. Still, the fanclub thing was a good cover. Right?</p><p>You arrived back late. Peter was sitting on his bed, watching something on his laptop. </p><p>\u2018What\u2019cha watching?\u2019 you asked. He jumped.</p><p>\u2018Oh, uh, just a movie.\u2019</p><p>\u2018What movie?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Alien,\u2019 he replied. \u2018It\u2019s- uh, I\u2019ve seen it a bunch of times but I love it.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ve never seen that,\u2019 you replied.</p><p>\u2018You haven\u2019t?\u2019 his eyes widened. \u2018Hey, uh, sit down!\u2019 </p><p>You sat next to him on the bed. He was blushing as he unpaused the movie.</p><p>You woke up. It was past midnight. You were in your own bed, still fully dressed. You put two and two together and realised that Peter must have moved you when you fell asleep. Peter was on his own bed, deep in concentration. He was scribbling in a notebook and stirring some kind of liquid. He poured the liquid into a tiny capsule and slid it into something on his wrist. He aimed at the ceiling. A long string of white fluid sprayed from his wrist and stuck to the ceiling, like\u2026 Like a spider\u2019s web. </p><p>You rolled over and went back to sleep.</p><p>You and Peter became friends quickly, even though he was always disappearing. He said it was for debate club, chess club and the Spider-Man fanclub. Once or twice you had asked to join the fanclub. He had blushed deeply and said that it was \u2018an all-male fanclub\u2019. You had rolled your eyes and given up. You watched a movie together almost every night. Sometimes Peter invited Ned, one of his friends from high school, over to your dorm. Peter had given no indication that he had a girlfriend. Or, for that matter, any friends other than Ned. All your friends were back in England, so you were grateful for Ned coming over. You and Ned hung out without Peter if Peter disappeared. </p><p>It was a Friday night. You had finished an essay for English lit, and you were hanging out, watching Roman Holiday with Ned. </p><p>\u2018You\u2019re single, right?\u2019 asked Ned suddenly. </p><p>\u2018You asking me out?\u2019 you joked. \u2018But yeah, I am.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Not asking you out,\u2019 Ned grinned with a laugh. \u2018Just wondering.\u2019</p><p>The days spun by, and soon it was half-term. You were staying in the dorm for the week, excited for a chance to actually hang out in New York without having to worry about work. You had a job in a caf\u00e9 and plans to explore the city. </p><p>You were finishing off your week\u2019s assignment, the only work you had due for after the half-term, when the window opened. This was a regular occurrence at this point - Peter used the window more than the door. His footsteps landed heavily on the floor.</p><p>\u2018Hey, Peter,\u2019 you greeted, not looking up. Peter said nothing. His breath was coming out in short gasps. You looked up.</p><p>Peter, still in his Spider-Man suit, was bleeding. His entire side had been slashed, and the blood was coming out in sheets. Your brain flooded with blind panic.</p><p>\u2018Fuck!\u2019 you yelled. \u2018Peter, what the hell?\u2019 </p><p>You grabbed your phone.</p><p>\u2018No,\u2019 slurred Peter. \u2018Don\u2019t call Ambl\u2026. ambu\u2026.ambulance, call May\u2026\u2019</p><p>You grabbed Peter\u2019s phone and pressed on his aunt\u2019s number, which was at the top of his emergency contacts. </p><p>\u2018May?\u2019 you snapped. \u2018Is this Peter\u2019s aunt? I\u2019m Y/N, Peter\u2019s roommate. He\u2019s been stabbed.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ll be right there,\u2019 May\u2019s voice was calm, even, and didn\u2019t sound even remotely shocked. \u2018Keep talking to him. Ask him what happened, his name, birthday, what he had for breakfast, anything. Keep him conscious. Apply pressure to the wound, try and slow the bleeding.\u2019</p><p>She hung up. </p><p>\u2018Peter, what happened?\u2019 you asked.</p><p>\u2018Car thief,\u2019 Peter\u2019s voice was soft and tired. \u2018Knife. I tried to web him, and he lashed out.\u2019</p><p>\u2018What?\u2019 you frowned. \u2018Peter, what happened to fanclub? Where were you? Why were you trying to\u2026 web him?\u2019</p><p>The pieces clicked together.</p><p>Peter coming in through the window, dressed as Spider-Man.</p><p>The all-male fanclub that you weren\u2019t allowed to join.</p><p>The time you had woken up and seen him experimenting with that white goop.</p><p>Peter was Spider-Man.</p><p>\u2018Oh, yeah,\u2019 Peter slurred. \u2018I forgot you didn\u2019t know\u2026 I\u2019m Spider- Spider-Man.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Okay, good to, good to know,\u2019 you stuttered. You asked him a few basic questions, and then there was a knock on the door.</p><p>Peter\u2019s Aunt May stood, armed with a first-aid kit and a steely expression. She strode over to Peter, lying on the floor.</p><p>\u2018Whassup, May?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Don\u2019t \u2018whassup\u2019 me, Peter,\u2019 May sighed. She grabbed some rubbing alcohol and bandages. \u2018If we can slow the bleeding, your body will take care of the rest.\u2019 </p><p>\u2018Y/N,\u2019 murmured Peter. </p><p>\u2018Yeah?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Sorry for wrecking your carpet,\u2019 he slurred. You realised he had bled all over your white rug.</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s alright, Peter,\u2019 you shook your head with a smile. </p><p>Time sped by. Now that you knew Peter\u2019s secret, the two of you had grown even closer. You watched countless movies, went shopping for dorm stuff, and helped each other study. </p><p>You had by now accepted the fact that you had a crush on him. </p><p>But you were fine. He didn\u2019t like you back - why would he? None of your other crushes ever had, so why would this one be any different? It was a crush, that\u2019s all. And crushes pass.</p><p>But this felt different. Whenever he wasn\u2019t around, you found yourself looking over to see his reaction to something you said, before realising he wasn\u2019t there. You remembered little details - the name of his childhood pet, his favourite movie, his dad\u2019s name. </p><p>It was your second semester of the year. You were sitting on your bed, typing an essay. You heard the window open. Peter\u2019s footsteps landed heavily on the ground.</p><p>\u2018Hey, Peter, how was patrol?\u2019 </p><p>\u2018It was - yeah,\u2019 Peter sighed. You heard him hiss as he took off his mask, and you looked up. </p><p>Peter\u2019s face was bleeding. </p><p>\u2018Shit, Peter, not again,\u2019 you got up and grabbed the first-aid kit. \u2018You\u2019ve gotta be more careful.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Can\u2019t help it,\u2019 he mumbled. \u2018They came from behind. Swiss army knife.\u2019</p><p>You took a deep breath, cleaning Peter\u2019s wound. \u2018Peter, it- it stresses me out, okay? When you leave, and I don\u2019t know when you\u2019ll be back, or if you\u2019ll be okay, or\u2026\u2019</p><p>\u2018Really?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yeah, Peter. I\u2019m worried about you.\u2019</p><p>Peter\u2019s expression stiffened. \u2018I can take care of myself, you know.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I know that, Peter, I just\u2026 I get scared.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Well, you don\u2019t need to get scared, alright? I\u2019m fine. I\u2019m an adult.\u2019</p><p>\u2018And yet I\u2019m the one that takes care of your wounds.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I never asked you to help.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Peter, you came home and fucking bled out on my floor, okay? You need my help.\u2019</p><p>\u2018No,\u2019 Peter stood up just as you placed a plaster on his cut. \u2018I don\u2019t need your help, Y/N. And I don\u2019t fucking want it, either.\u2019</p><p>You felt shaky. Like you were about to cry. \u2018Good luck cleaning your wounds when you\u2019re unconscious, Parker.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Like I said, I\u2019m an adult,\u2019 Peter was at the door now. \u2018I can take care of my own fucking wounds.\u2019</p><p>You felt a tear slip down your face. \u2018Peter, I -\u2019 your voice cracked. </p><p>Peter turned to face you, looking surprised.</p><p>\u2018What?\u2019 he asked.</p><p>\u2018You go out every night, okay? And I never know if you\u2019re gonna come back with a stab wound or a bullet wound. And I get so - so fucking scared every time you leave. And\u2026 I just- You know what the worst part is? Sometimes you\u2019re a fucking asshole, okay? But the worst part is\u2026 I just\u2026 I love you anyway.\u2019</p><p>Peter froze. You realised what you had just said. Peter\u2019s eyes lit up with\u2026 something? </p><p>\u2018I - I mean, as- as a friend,\u2019 you stuttered, laughing it off.</p><p>Peter\u2019s face fell slightly. \u2018I- I have to go.\u2019</p><p>Ten minutes later, your phone buzzed. </p><p><b>Ned: y/n what the hell did you do to peter</b></p><p><b>You: nothing what\u2019s wrong?</b></p><p><b>Ned: he\u2019s crying his eyes out</b></p><p><b>You: what? I\u2019m coming over</b></p><p><b>Ned: no dont he just asked me not to invite you over</b></p><p><b>You: has he said anything</b></p><p><b>Ned: he said you had said that you loved him as a friend</b></p><p><b>Ned: oh shit he just said not to tell you any of this</b></p><p><b>Ned: he just said he loves you</b></p><p><b>Ned: as more than a friend</b></p><p><b>You: what??? Holy shit</b></p><p><b>You: tell him i said i like him back</b></p><p><b>Ned: WHAT? YOU DO?</b></p><p><b>Ned: why\u2019d you say you only loved him as a friend</b></p><p><b>You: i didn\u2019t think he felt the same way</b></p><p><b>Ned: i\u2019m telling him to go back to the dorm room</b></p><p><b>Ned: he\u2019s on his way to the dorm now</b></p><p>You slumped on your bed, utterly confused. Peter was crying? Because of you? And he\u2026. Loved you? No. That - Ned had made a mistake.</p><p>There was a soft knock on the door. </p><p>\u2018Y/N?\u2019 asked Peter. \u2018Can I - come in?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Sure,\u2019 you replied. Peter walked in. \u2018Ned told me what you said,\u2019 you told him. Peter froze. His eyes were still blotchy. He swallowed.</p><p>\u2018Uh, what- what did I say?\u2019</p><p>\u2018That, you- that you, uh, that\u2026 That you loved me.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh,\u2019 Peter laughed bitterly, looking down. \u2018That.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Peter, it\u2019s-\u2019</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s nothing. You don\u2019t feel the same way. Can we still be friends?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Peter, I-\u2019</p><p>\u2018Y/N, it\u2019s fine. Can we drop it?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Peter, I do feel the same way.\u2019</p><p>Peter was in the middle of hanging his coat up on the door. The coat slipped from his fingers and landed on the floor.</p><p>\u2018You- what?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I didn\u2019t tell you because I didn\u2019t think you felt the same way. I said that I loved you, you looked surprised, so I lied and said it was just as a friend. Peter, I love you, alright? No matter how many times you get stabbed.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I love you too, Y/N.\u2019</p>",

Just as you were about to leave the dorm room, the window opened. A boy jumped through, wearing a big old yellow coat and sweatpants. His shoes were bright red and blue, peeking out from under his coat. The boy froze.</p><p>\u2018Oh! Um, you must be Y/N. I\u2019m Peter,\u2019 said the boy. </p><p>You laughed nervously. \u2018So, um, what\u2019s with the outfit?\u2019 you asked. \u2018And the, uh, the window?\u2019</p><p>There was utter silence. Peter swallowed. </p><p>\u2018So\u2026\u2019 he rubbed the back of his neck awkwardly. \u2018You know Spider-Man?\u2019</p>[[MORE]]<p>You had been a super-fan of Spider-Man since he first appeared, but you weren\u2019t about to tell Peter about the hours spent nagging your parents to drop you off in Queens so you could stalk him. Spider-Man, that is, not Peter.</p><p>\u2018Yeah, I know him. What about him?\u2019 you tilted your head. Peter wouldn\u2019t meet your eyes.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m- uh, I mean- I\u2019m\u2026\u2019 he stopped and took a deep breath. \u2018I\u2019m part of a fanclub,\u2019 he blurted out. \u2018A Spider-Man fanclub. We meet in Washington Square Park once a week, and we\u2026 we cosplay and stuff.\u2019</p><p>Peter unzipped his coat to reveal a Spider-Man suit. Damn, the guy had muscles. You looked up to meet his eyes. </p><p>\u2018Why did you come in through the window?\u2019 you asked. </p><p>\u2018Authenticity,\u2019 he replied instantly. </p><p>\u2018Wow, you\u2019re a nerd,\u2019 you snorted. </p><p>\u2018And you didn\u2019t get that from the Star Wars poster?\u2019 Peter grinned. </p><p>\u2018Fair,\u2019 you smiled at him. \u2018I\u2019m going out, I\u2019ll see you later.\u2019</p><p>You paused at the door before winking and adding, \u2018Spider-Man.\u2019</p><p>Peter stood, frozen, staring at the door. He didn\u2019t think his roommate would arrive until later. And now he had lied to her. It would have been easier if he had just said he was Spider-Man. She probably wouldn\u2019t have believed him anyway. Still, the fanclub thing was a good cover. Right?</p><p>You arrived back late. Peter was sitting on his bed, watching something on his laptop. </p><p>\u2018What\u2019cha watching?\u2019 you asked. He jumped.</p><p>\u2018Oh, uh, just a movie.\u2019</p><p>\u2018What movie?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Alien,\u2019 he replied. \u2018It\u2019s- uh, I\u2019ve seen it a bunch of times but I love it.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ve never seen that,\u2019 you replied.</p><p>\u2018You haven\u2019t?\u2019 his eyes widened. \u2018Hey, uh, sit down!\u2019 </p><p>You sat next to him on the bed. He was blushing as he unpaused the movie.</p><p>You woke up. It was past midnight. You were in your own bed, still fully dressed. You put two and two together and realised that Peter must have moved you when you fell asleep. Peter was on his own bed, deep in concentration. He was scribbling in a notebook and stirring some kind of liquid. He poured the liquid into a tiny capsule and slid it into something on his wrist. He aimed at the ceiling. A long string of white fluid sprayed from his wrist and stuck to the ceiling, like\u2026 Like a spider\u2019s web. </p><p>You rolled over and went back to sleep.</p><p>You and Peter became friends quickly, even though he was always disappearing. He said it was for debate club, chess club and the Spider-Man fanclub. Once or twice you had asked to join the fanclub. He had blushed deeply and said that it was \u2018an all-male fanclub\u2019. You had rolled your eyes and given up. You watched a movie together almost every night. Sometimes Peter invited Ned, one of his friends from high school, over to your dorm. Peter had given no indication that he had a girlfriend. Or, for that matter, any friends other than Ned. All your friends were back in England, so you were grateful for Ned coming over. You and Ned hung out without Peter if Peter disappeared. </p><p>It was a Friday night. You had finished an essay for English lit, and you were hanging out, watching Roman Holiday with Ned. </p><p>\u2018You\u2019re single, right?\u2019 asked Ned suddenly. </p><p>\u2018You asking me out?\u2019 you joked. \u2018But yeah, I am.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Not asking you out,\u2019 Ned grinned with a laugh. \u2018Just wondering.\u2019</p><p>The days spun by, and soon it was half-term. You were staying in the dorm for the week, excited for a chance to actually hang out in New York without having to worry about work. You had a job in a caf\u00e9 and plans to explore the city. </p><p>You were finishing off your week\u2019s assignment, the only work you had due for after the half-term, when the window opened. This was a regular occurrence at this point - Peter used the window more than the door. His footsteps landed heavily on the floor.</p><p>\u2018Hey, Peter,\u2019 you greeted, not looking up. Peter said nothing. His breath was coming out in short gasps. You looked up.</p><p>Peter, still in his Spider-Man suit, was bleeding. His entire side had been slashed, and the blood was coming out in sheets. Your brain flooded with blind panic.</p><p>\u2018Fuck!\u2019 you yelled. \u2018Peter, what the hell?\u2019 </p><p>You grabbed your phone.</p><p>\u2018No,\u2019 slurred Peter. \u2018Don\u2019t call Ambl\u2026. ambu\u2026.ambulance, call May\u2026\u2019</p><p>You grabbed Peter\u2019s phone and pressed on his aunt\u2019s number, which was at the top of his emergency contacts. </p><p>\u2018May?\u2019 you snapped. \u2018Is this Peter\u2019s aunt? I\u2019m Y/N, Peter\u2019s roommate. He\u2019s been stabbed.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ll be right there,\u2019 May\u2019s voice was calm, even, and didn\u2019t sound even remotely shocked. \u2018Keep talking to him. Ask him what happened, his name, birthday, what he had for breakfast, anything. Keep him conscious. Apply pressure to the wound, try and slow the bleeding.\u2019</p><p>She hung up. </p><p>\u2018Peter, what happened?\u2019 you asked.</p><p>\u2018Car thief,\u2019 Peter\u2019s voice was soft and tired. \u2018Knife. I tried to web him, and he lashed out.\u2019</p><p>\u2018What?\u2019 you frowned. \u2018Peter, what happened to fanclub? Where were you? Why were you trying to\u2026 web him?\u2019</p><p>The pieces clicked together.</p><p>Peter coming in through the window, dressed as Spider-Man.</p><p>The all-male fanclub that you weren\u2019t allowed to join.</p><p>The time you had woken up and seen him experimenting with that white goop.</p><p>Peter was Spider-Man.</p><p>\u2018Oh, yeah,\u2019 Peter slurred. \u2018I forgot you didn\u2019t know\u2026 I\u2019m Spider- Spider-Man.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Okay, good to, good to know,\u2019 you stuttered. You asked him a few basic questions, and then there was a knock on the door.</p><p>Peter\u2019s Aunt May stood, armed with a first-aid kit and a steely expression. She strode over to Peter, lying on the floor.</p><p>\u2018Whassup, May?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Don\u2019t \u2018whassup\u2019 me, Peter,\u2019 May sighed. She grabbed some rubbing alcohol and bandages. \u2018If we can slow the bleeding, your body will take care of the rest.\u2019 </p><p>\u2018Y/N,\u2019 murmured Peter. </p><p>\u2018Yeah?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Sorry for wrecking your carpet,\u2019 he slurred. You realised he had bled all over your white rug.</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s alright, Peter,\u2019 you shook your head with a smile. </p><p>Time sped by. Now that you knew Peter\u2019s secret, the two of you had grown even closer. You watched countless movies, went shopping for dorm stuff, and helped each other study. </p><p>You had by now accepted the fact that you had a crush on him. </p><p>But you were fine. He didn\u2019t like you back - why would he? None of your other crushes ever had, so why would this one be any different? It was a crush, that\u2019s all. And crushes pass.</p><p>But this felt different. Whenever he wasn\u2019t around, you found yourself looking over to see his reaction to something you said, before realising he wasn\u2019t there. You remembered little details - the name of his childhood pet, his favourite movie, his dad\u2019s name. </p><p>It was your second semester of the year. You were sitting on your bed, typing an essay. You heard the window open. Peter\u2019s footsteps landed heavily on the ground.</p><p>\u2018Hey, Peter, how was patrol?\u2019 </p><p>\u2018It was - yeah,\u2019 Peter sighed. You heard him hiss as he took off his mask, and you looked up. </p><p>Peter\u2019s face was bleeding. </p><p>\u2018Shit, Peter, not again,\u2019 you got up and grabbed the first-aid kit. \u2018You\u2019ve gotta be more careful.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Can\u2019t help it,\u2019 he mumbled. \u2018They came from behind. Swiss army knife.\u2019</p><p>You took a deep breath, cleaning Peter\u2019s wound. \u2018Peter, it- it stresses me out, okay? When you leave, and I don\u2019t know when you\u2019ll be back, or if you\u2019ll be okay, or\u2026\u2019</p><p>\u2018Really?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yeah, Peter. I\u2019m worried about you.\u2019</p><p>Peter\u2019s expression stiffened. \u2018I can take care of myself, you know.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I know that, Peter, I just\u2026 I get scared.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Well, you don\u2019t need to get scared, alright? I\u2019m fine. I\u2019m an adult.\u2019</p><p>\u2018And yet I\u2019m the one that takes care of your wounds.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I never asked you to help.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Peter, you came home and fucking bled out on my floor, okay? You need my help.\u2019</p><p>\u2018No,\u2019 Peter stood up just as you placed a plaster on his cut. \u2018I don\u2019t need your help, Y/N. And I don\u2019t fucking want it, either.\u2019</p><p>You felt shaky. Like you were about to cry. \u2018Good luck cleaning your wounds when you\u2019re unconscious, Parker.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Like I said, I\u2019m an adult,\u2019 Peter was at the door now. \u2018I can take care of my own fucking wounds.\u2019</p><p>You felt a tear slip down your face. \u2018Peter, I -\u2019 your voice cracked. </p><p>Peter turned to face you, looking surprised.</p><p>\u2018What?\u2019 he asked.</p><p>\u2018You go out every night, okay? And I never know if you\u2019re gonna come back with a stab wound or a bullet wound. And I get so - so fucking scared every time you leave. And\u2026 I just- You know what the worst part is? Sometimes you\u2019re a fucking asshole, okay? But the worst part is\u2026 I just\u2026 I love you anyway.\u2019</p><p>Peter froze. You realised what you had just said. Peter\u2019s eyes lit up with\u2026 something? </p><p>\u2018I - I mean, as- as a friend,\u2019 you stuttered, laughing it off.</p><p>Peter\u2019s face fell slightly. \u2018I- I have to go.\u2019</p><p>Ten minutes later, your phone buzzed. </p><p><b>Ned: y/n what the hell did you do to peter</b></p><p><b>You: nothing what\u2019s wrong?</b></p><p><b>Ned: he\u2019s crying his eyes out</b></p><p><b>You: what? I\u2019m coming over</b></p><p><b>Ned: no dont he just asked me not to invite you over</b></p><p><b>You: has he said anything</b></p><p><b>Ned: he said you had said that you loved him as a friend</b></p><p><b>Ned: oh shit he just said not to tell you any of this</b></p><p><b>Ned: he just said he loves you</b></p><p><b>Ned: as more than a friend</b></p><p><b>You: what??? Holy shit</b></p><p><b>You: tell him i said i like him back</b></p><p><b>Ned: WHAT? YOU DO?</b></p><p><b>Ned: why\u2019d you say you only loved him as a friend</b></p><p><b>You: i didn\u2019t think he felt the same way</b></p><p><b>Ned: i\u2019m telling him to go back to the dorm room</b></p><p><b>Ned: he\u2019s on his way to the dorm now</b></p><p>You slumped on your bed, utterly confused. Peter was crying? Because of you? And he\u2026. Loved you? No. That - Ned had made a mistake.</p><p>There was a soft knock on the door. </p><p>\u2018Y/N?\u2019 asked Peter. \u2018Can I - come in?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Sure,\u2019 you replied. Peter walked in. \u2018Ned told me what you said,\u2019 you told him. Peter froze. His eyes were still blotchy. He swallowed.</p><p>\u2018Uh, what- what did I say?\u2019</p><p>\u2018That, you- that you, uh, that\u2026 That you loved me.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh,\u2019 Peter laughed bitterly, looking down. \u2018That.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Peter, it\u2019s-\u2019</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s nothing. You don\u2019t feel the same way. Can we still be friends?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Peter, I-\u2019</p><p>\u2018Y/N, it\u2019s fine. Can we drop it?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Peter, I do feel the same way.\u2019</p><p>Peter was in the middle of hanging his coat up on the door. The coat slipped from his fingers and landed on the floor.</p><p>\u2018You- what?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I didn\u2019t tell you because I didn\u2019t think you felt the same way. I said that I loved you, you looked surprised, so I lied and said it was just as a friend. Peter, I love you, alright? No matter how many times you get stabbed.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I love you too, Y/N.\u2019</p>",

You had made it. </p><p>You were from London originally, but it was your dream to study in New York and you had finally worked your ass off and got a scholarship. You had no friends or family in New York, but you had a dorm on campus. </p><p>You started to unpack, putting up posters with Blu-Tac and putting books onto the shelf above your bed. You put your own bedding onto the bed, and put your laptop onto the desk along with all your folders. It was only when you turned around that you noticed the other half of the room.</p><p>You had signed up for a roommate, figuring it was an easy way to make a friend, and clearly she had already moved in. There was a Star Wars poster on the wall. Clothes were spread on the bed - sweaters and jeans. A backpack lay forgotten at the foot of the bed. The desk was covered in books and folders. You glanced at them. </p><p>Peter Parker, read the handwritten labels.</p><p>Was your new roommate a boy?</p><p>You called Alexandra, your best friend from London. </p><p>&lsquo;Y/N! How is it?&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s amazing. It&rsquo;s so pretty, and it&rsquo;s right next to Washington Square Park, and&hellip;&rsquo; you gushed about the university. </p><p>&lsquo;Wow! So, you met any cute American boys yet?&rsquo;</p><p>You snorted. &lsquo;Alex, I&rsquo;ve literally just stepped foot into my dorm. I haven&rsquo;t even met my roommate yet!&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;Ooh, who&rsquo;s she?&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;He,&rsquo; you said. &lsquo;His name&rsquo;s Peter. He&rsquo;s&hellip; Messy.&rsquo; </p><p>Alex laughed. &lsquo;Of course miss clean freak gets stuck with a messy roommate. Also, a boy!&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;Calm down, Alex. He could be a terrible person for all I know, alright? I&rsquo;m gonna go explore, but I&rsquo;ll call you later.&rsquo; </p><p>You ended the call. Just as you were about to leave the dorm room, the window opened. A boy jumped through, wearing a big old yellow coat and sweatpants. His shoes were bright red and blue, peeking out from under his coat. The boy froze.</p><p>&lsquo;Oh! Um, you must be Y/N. I&rsquo;m Peter,&rsquo; said the boy. </p><p>You laughed nervously. &lsquo;So, um, what&rsquo;s with the outfit?&rsquo; you asked. &lsquo;And the, uh, the window?&rsquo;</p><p>There was utter silence.

You heard him hiss as he took off his mask, and you looked up. </p><p>Peter&rsquo;s face was bleeding. </p><p>&lsquo;Shit, Peter, not again,&rsquo; you got up and grabbed the first-aid kit. &lsquo;You&rsquo;ve gotta be more careful.&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;Can&rsquo;t help it,&rsquo; he mumbled. &lsquo;They came from behind. Swiss army knife.&rsquo;</p><p>You took a deep breath, cleaning Peter&rsquo;s wound. &lsquo;Peter, it- it stresses me out, okay? When you leave, and I don&rsquo;t know when you&rsquo;ll be back, or if you&rsquo;ll be okay, or&hellip;&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;Really?&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;Yeah, Peter. I&rsquo;m worried about you.&rsquo;</p><p>Peter&rsquo;s expression stiffened. &lsquo;I can take care of myself, you know.&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;I know that, Peter, I just&hellip; I get scared.&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;Well, you don&rsquo;t need to get scared, alright? I&rsquo;m fine. I&rsquo;m an adult.&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;And yet I&rsquo;m the one that takes care of your wounds.&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;I never asked you to help.&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;Peter, you came home and fucking bled out on my floor, okay? You need my help.&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; Peter stood up just as you placed a plaster on his cut. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t need your help, Y/N. And I don&rsquo;t fucking want it, either.&rsquo;</p><p>You felt shaky. Like you were about to cry. &lsquo;Good luck cleaning your wounds when you&rsquo;re unconscious, Parker.&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;Like I said, I&rsquo;m an adult,&rsquo; Peter was at the door now. &lsquo;I can take care of my own fucking wounds.&rsquo;</p><p>You felt a tear slip down your face. &lsquo;Peter, I -&rsquo; your voice cracked. </p><p>Peter turned to face you, looking surprised.</p><p>&lsquo;What?&rsquo; he asked.</p><p>&lsquo;You go out every night, okay? And I never know if you&rsquo;re gonna come back with a stab wound or a bullet wound. And I get so - so fucking scared every time you leave. And&hellip; I just- You know what the worst part is? Sometimes you&rsquo;re a fucking asshole, okay? But the worst part is&hellip; I just&hellip; I love you anyway.&rsquo;</p><p>Peter froze. You realised what you had just said. Peter&rsquo;s eyes lit up with&hellip; something? </p><p>&lsquo;I - I mean, as- as a friend,&rsquo; you stuttered, laughing it off.</p><p>Peter&rsquo;s face fell slightly. &lsquo;I- I have to go.&rsquo;</p><p>Ten minutes later, your phone buzzed. </p><p><b>Ned: y/n what the hell did you do to peter</b></p><p><b>You: nothing what&rsquo;s wrong?</b></p><p><b>Ned: he&rsquo;s crying his eyes out</b></p><p><b>You: what? I&rsquo;m coming over</b></p><p><b>Ned: no dont he just asked me not to invite you over</b></p><p><b>You: has he said anything</b></p><p><b>Ned: he said you had said that you loved him as a friend</b></p><p><b>Ned: oh shit he just said not to tell you any of this</b></p><p><b>Ned: he just said he loves you</b></p><p><b>Ned: as more than a friend</b></p><p><b>You: what??? Holy shit</b></p><p><b>You: tell him i said i like him back</b></p><p><b>Ned: WHAT? YOU DO?</b></p><p><b>Ned: why&rsquo;d you say you only loved him as a friend</b></p><p><b>You: i didn&rsquo;t think he felt the same way</b></p><p><b>Ned: i&rsquo;m telling him to go back to the dorm room</b></p><p><b>Ned: he&rsquo;s on his way to the dorm now</b></p><p>You slumped on your bed, utterly confused. Peter was crying? Because of you? And he&hellip;. Loved you? No. That - Ned had made a mistake.</p><p>There was a soft knock on the door. </p><p>&lsquo;Y/N?&rsquo; asked Peter. &lsquo;Can I - come in?&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;Sure,&rsquo; you replied. Peter walked in. &lsquo;Ned told me what you said,&rsquo; you told him. Peter froze. His eyes were still blotchy. He swallowed.</p><p>&lsquo;Uh, what- what did I say?&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;That, you- that you, uh, that&hellip; That you loved me.&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;Oh,&rsquo; Peter laughed bitterly, looking down. &lsquo;That.&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;Peter, it&rsquo;s-&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s nothing. You don&rsquo;t feel the same way. Can we still be friends?&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;Peter, I-&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;Y/N, it&rsquo;s fine. Can we drop it?&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;Peter, I do feel the same way.&rsquo;</p><p>Peter was in the middle of hanging his coat up on the door. The coat slipped from his fingers and landed on the floor.</p><p>&lsquo;You- what?&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t tell you because I didn&rsquo;t think you felt the same way. I said that I loved you, you looked surprised, so I lied and said it was just as a friend. Peter, I love you, alright? No matter how many times you get stabbed.&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;I love you too, Y/N.&rsquo;</p>",

You had made it. </p>\n<p>You were from London originally, but it was your dream to study in New York and you had finally worked your ass off and got a scholarship. You had no friends or family in New York, but you had a dorm on campus. </p>\n<p>You started to unpack, putting up posters with Blu-Tac and putting books onto the shelf above your bed. You put your own bedding onto the bed, and put your laptop onto the desk along with all your folders. It was only when you turned around that you noticed the other half of the room.</p>\n<p>You had signed up for a roommate, figuring it was an easy way to make a friend, and clearly she had already moved in. There was a Star Wars poster on the wall. Clothes were spread on the bed - sweaters and jeans. A backpack lay forgotten at the foot of the bed. The desk was covered in books and folders. You glanced at them. </p>\n<p>Peter Parker, read the handwritten labels.</p>\n<p>Was your new roommate a boy?</p>\n<p>You called Alexandra, your best friend from London. </p>\n<p>&lsquo;Y/N! How is it?&rsquo;</p>\n<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s amazing. It&rsquo;s so pretty, and it&rsquo;s right next to Washington Square Park, and&hellip;&rsquo; you gushed about the university. </p>\n<p>&lsquo;Wow! So, you met any cute American boys yet?&rsquo;</p>\n<p>You snorted. &lsquo;Alex, I&rsquo;ve literally just stepped foot into my dorm. I haven&rsquo;t even met my roommate yet!&rsquo;</p>\n<p>&lsquo;Ooh, who&rsquo;s she?&rsquo;</p>\n<p>&lsquo;He,&rsquo; you said. &lsquo;His name&rsquo;s Peter. He&rsquo;s&hellip; Messy.&rsquo; </p>\n<p>Alex laughed. &lsquo;Of course miss clean freak gets stuck with a messy roommate. Also, a boy!&rsquo;</p>\n<p>&lsquo;Calm down, Alex. He could be a terrible person for all I know, alright? I&rsquo;m gonna go explore, but I&rsquo;ll call you later.&rsquo; </p>\n<p>You ended the call. Just as you were about to leave the dorm room, the window opened. A boy jumped through, wearing a big old yellow coat and sweatpants. His shoes were bright red and blue, peeking out from under his coat. The boy froze.</p>\n<p>&lsquo;Oh! Um, you must be Y/N. I&rsquo;m Peter,&rsquo; said the boy. </p>\n<p>You laughed nervously. &lsquo;So, um, what&rsquo;s with the outfit?&rsquo; you asked. &lsquo;And the, uh, the window?&rsquo;</p>\n<p>There was utter silence. Peter swallowed. </p>\n<p>&lsquo;So&hellip;&rsquo; he rubbed the back of his neck awkwardly. &lsquo;You know Spider-Man?&rsquo;</p>\n</p>",

I hopped out of the car and headed towards the entrance.</p><p>I made my way to the principal&rsquo;s office. Since I was joining in the middle of the year I was getting a tour. As I walked people watched me. Most whispered to their friends and many more pointed at me.

It made me happy knowing that I would never run out of books. I found the horror section and then looked for the S\u2019s when I found them I instantly grabbed every Stephen King book that I hadn&rsquo;t read I looked at my stack and decided to begin with \u201cDifferent Seasons\u201d a short story book.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I went to the library clerk who checked out my books then caring all of them with Different Seasons open on top I walked back to the cafeteria intending to sit in a corner reading the rest of lunch.

Since the accident I had been homeschooled. I was going to go to school at the beginning of the year but my panic attacks had gotten so bad that I was forced to stay home another two months. I was really excited. I took my own car which Tony had just given me it was an amazing red convertible; everyone\u2019s dream car. As I pulled up people stared, most of them knew who I was. I hopped out of the car and headed towards the entrance.</p><p>I made my way to the principal\u2019s office. Since I was joining in the middle of the year I was getting a tour. As I walked people watched me. Most whispered to their friends and many more pointed at me. My heart began to speed up and I had to force my head to look at the floor.</p><p>\u201cHi y/n, I\u2019m Mr. Morita.\u201d the principle said when I walked into the front office.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHi\u201d I said. </p><p>\u201cY/n, this is Clara she is going to show you around.\u201d he said. </p><p>\u201cHi y/n.\u201d said a pretty girl standing next to Mr. Morita.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cAll right let\u2019s start the tour.\u201d </p><p>Clara was really nice she helped me find my locker and showed me around then I headed to my first class. Throughout the day people came up to me and asked if I wanted to sit with them at lunch. Guys hit on me and girls were desperate to become my friend. I hated it. They only cared about who my uncle was not who I was.</p><p>At lunch I didn\u2019t know where to sit so I went to the library to check out some books. I walked in and looked and all the shelves. It made me happy knowing that I would never run out of books. I found the horror section and then looked for the S\u2019s when I found them I instantly grabbed every Stephen King book that I hadn\u2019t read I looked at my stack and decided to begin with \u201cDifferent Seasons\u201d a short story book.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I went to the library clerk who checked out my books then caring all of them with Different Seasons open on top I walked back to the cafeteria intending to sit in a corner reading the rest of lunch. I was too busy reading to notice anything around me as I turned a corner I ran straight into someone. We both hit the ground books scattered everywhere.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh sorry I wasn\u2019t paying attention.\u201d I stammered I said wiping my forehead to reveal a streak of blood \u201cShit.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The boy I had run into was kinda cute. He had curly brown hair and almond brown eyes. His jawline was sharp and precise. He looked up and seemed startled to see me. \u201cA-are you ok\u201d he managed to get out.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYeah I\u2019m fine thanks, the corner of one of the books just hit my head\u201d I replied \u201cyou really don\u2019t have to help I wasn\u2019t paying attention\u201d I said as the boy helped picked up my books.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIts no problem\u201d he said \u201cI\u2019m Peter by the way.\u201d he said looking up at me. His smile was contagious. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m y/n.\u201d I replied my lips breaking into a smile, \u201cSorry again Peter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d he said \u201cHope your head is ok.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, see you around.\u201d I said taking my books from him.</p><p>Peters P.O.V</p><p>I was heading to Mrs. Kyler\u2019s room when I ran straight into someone coming around the corner. Books scattered everywhere and I was knocked to the ground. So was the girl. She began apologizing as she did I began to pick up the books. I looked up at her and was startled to see y/n. She looked even more beautiful today then she did last night. her eyes were shining, her hair hanging effortlessly around her shoulders. I could tell she barely tried and still looked amazing. Then I saw the blood on her forehead. \u201cAre you ok?\u201d I asked as calmly as possible. </p><p>\u201cYeah I\u2019m fine thanks, the corner of one of the books just hit my head\u201d She said \u201cyou really don\u2019t have to help I wasn\u2019t paying attention\u201d She told me. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine\u201d I was trying to look down to keep from staring at her. \u201cI\u2019m Peter by the way.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m y/n.\u201d She replied her smile made me feel light headed, \u201cSorry again Peter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d I said \u201cHope your head is ok.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, see you around.\u201d She took her books from me. I watched walk away in amazement. I could feel my heart beating fast again.</p></p>",
