She hated crowds, she hated flying and\nshe hated goodbyes. \u00a0But here she was, in the middle of Sydney Airport,\nsaying goodbye to her family about to board the plane that was going to take\nher to her new life in London. Nervous was an understatement, not only was she\nabout to be sitting in a giant metal box that could fall out of the sky at any\ngiven moment for the next 28 hours, but when she landed she would be starting\nher whole life fresh and that was equally as terrifying. </p><p>Her Mother\u2019s warm\narms wrapped and her and tears formed in Poppy\u2019s eyes and as hard as she tried\nto choke them back, she knew they were going to fall. </p><p>\u201cCall me when you\nland, won\u2019t you Pop?\u201d her Mum said, tears filling her eyes too. </p><p>\u201cOf course Mum\u201d Poppy\nsmiled, \u201cYou know I will\u201d </p><p>They both let go of\nthe hug they were so tightly embraced in and Poppy moved on to say goodbye to\nher little sister, Addison</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t forget about\nme while you\u2019re over there\u201d Addie said, trying to play it off as a joke </p><p>\u201cI could never\u201d Poppy\nreplied mimicking her tone. \u201cTell Kai and Susie I said goodbye too, yeah?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah\u201d Addie nodded.\nKai was Poppy\u2019s older brother and Susie was his wife, they lived together in\nMelbourne and said their proper goodbyes to Poppy the last time she\u2019d been down\nto visit them. She knew she wouldn\u2019t miss them that much compared to the rest of\nher family that she was used to seeing everyday, but part of her heart would\nstill ache for them time to time, and it felt wrong saying goodbye to everyone\nelse without mentioning them. \u00a0</p><p>Poppy\u2019s dad wasn\u2019t\nthe best at goodbyes either, and by the time Poppy got round to him he was\nalready a mess. </p><p>\u201cJust don\u2019t do\nanything stupid while you\u2019re over there Pop, I won\u2019t be just around the corner\nto come and rescue you\u201d he said </p><p>\u201cWhen have you ever\nhad to do that here Dad?\u201d she giggled </p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a first for\neverything\u201d </p><p>Poppy rolled her eyes\nand hugged her dad one last time \u201cI\u2019ll see you at christmas Dad, Love you\u201d </p><p>\u201cI love you too Pop.\u201d\nAnd with that Poppy turned and walked through the departures gate. She was in a\ndaze as she passed through security because she couldn\u2019t quite believe that\nthis was really happening. A dream she\u2019d had since she was 15 was unfolding\nright in front of her eyes but there was a bittersweetness to it. Everything\nshe\u2019d ever dreamed of was at the other end of this plane journey, but she\u2019d\njust said goodbye to everything she\u2019d ever known and she knew she\u2019d miss home. </p><p>There was still an\nhour left before Poppy\u2019s plane was set to leave the runway so once she\u2019d found\nher gate and knew where she had to go, Poppy found the nearest coffee shop and\nordered herself a peppermint tea to try and calm her nerves. She wanted a\ncoffee, but after living off it for weeks during her final high school exams\nshe made a rule for herself that she was only allowed one cup a week, and she\nfigured that it was best reserved for after she lands. The hot tea washed over\nher tongue and she felt more relaxed almost instantly. She watched as the world\nwent by for the next hour, watching as people went off on their holidays or\nleft for their work trips, Poppy liked to give each person a story. The girl\nwith the red suitcase was going to New York, to start a job as a journalist at\nsome big magazine, Cosmo maybe. The man in the suit was flying to Hong Kong for\nbusiness but he would also get to his family while he\u2019s there. The group of\ngirls squealing next to her were off on their Gap Year Trip to europe, they\nmight even be on the same flight as her, although she hoped that they would be\nsitting far away from her. The family in the corner of the cafe were off on a\nquick trip to Bali because flights were cheap and they needed to get away from\nhumdrum of city life. </p><p>Poppy\u2019s thoughts were\ninterrupted by a voice over the intercom calling for her to board her flight.\nSo she picked up her duffle bag and her boarding pass and made her way to her\ngate. Tears filled her eyes as she walked and it took everything in her not to\nturn around and walk right back into her comfort zone, but she breathed deeply\nand handed her pass to the light attendant at who stood next to the tunnel that\nlead to the plane. </p><p>\u201cHave a nice flight\u201d\nshe said kindly and Poppy smiled at her.</p><p>***</p><p>March 3rd, 7am\nLondon, UK. </p><p>Poppy never realised\njust how far away from the rest of the world she had been until she landed at\nHeathrow Airport and everything crumbled in front of her as she read the email\nthat came through when she connected to the Starbucks Wifi as she waited for\nher much needed coffee. </p><p><i>\u201cDear Miss Thomas </i></p><p><i>Unfortunately, the\napartment that you have secured for rent will now be unavailable until 31/3/13\nas it is currently unfit to live in. The apartment will be fumigated and we\nwill keep you updated on when it is safe for you to move in. \u00a0We apologise\nfor any inconvenience that this will cause and wish you well with your travels.\nDon\u2019t hesitate to contact us with any enquiries you may have. </i></p><p><i>Iris Goodall,\nRelocations Manager.\u201d</i></p><p>Home was half a world\naway, and Poppy was out of her depths. She was 19, in a foreign country with no\nplace to go and all she wanted right now was a hug from her mum. In her haze of\nstress, she didn\u2019t notice what had been going on around her or that her name\nhad been called several times signalling that her coffee was ready. </p><p>\u201cAre you Poopy\u201d a\ntall brunette boy with a husky British accent asked, tearing her away from her\nweb search of cheap hotels in London </p><p>\u201cNo\u201d she said quietly\n\u201cbut I am Poppy\u201d </p><p>\u201cOne letter off,\nthat\u2019s not bad for a Starbucks this busy\u201dhe handed her the drink and smiled a\nlazy half smile that made her blush \u201cspeaking of busy, you mind if I sit here?\u201d\n</p><p>\u201cGo for it\u201d Poppy\nsaid, returning to her search. The boy didn\u2019t say much else for a while but\nPoppy couldn\u2019t help but recognise his face. She didn\u2019t know where from, but his\nwild curls and green eyes looked familiar, but how could they be? He was\nclearly British and if she\u2019d met him before she would have remembered. It\nwasn\u2019t until she read the name on his cup that it all clicked</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re that kid from\nthat band!\u201d She exclaimed louder than she intended causing a few people around\nthem to turn and stare. The boy waved them off nervously, thankful that they\nwere mostly middle aged men who wouldn\u2019t give two cents about the band he was\nin. </p><p>\u201cI am\u201d he said much\nquieter \u201cbut I prefer to go by Harry\u201d </p><p>\u201cOr Hairy\u201d Poppy said\npointing to his drink </p><p>\u201cHairy and Poopy, I\nlike it\u201d Harry smiled. \u201cSo what brings you to London?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m moving here for\nuniversity, I got a scholarship to come here all expenses paid but I\u2019ve got an\nemail to say that I\u2019ve got nowhere to live for three weeks\u201d </p><p>Harry crumpled his\neyebrows \u201cShouldn\u2019t they arrange something for you if things fell through?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Poppy\nsighed \u201cmaybe\u201d </p><p>\u201cCan I see the\nemail?\u201d He asked, looking towards her phone. She nodded and unlocked it and\nhanded it to him with the email already open. His brows crumpled again as he\nread it. </p><p>\u201cThey can\u2019t just let\nyou be homeless for three weeks,they should get you a hotel,I\u2019ll call them for\nyou if you like, get it all sorted?\u201d </p><p>Poppy was taken aback\nby his kindness, it wasn\u2019t something she expected from a random stranger let\nalone a stranger as famous as him. </p><p>\u201cNo no that\u2019s fine\u201d\nshe said \u201cI\u2019ll figure something out\u201d </p><p>\u201cPoopy, I don\u2019t know\nhow much you know about London in March, but the weather can be somewhat\nsporadic, you can\u2019t sleep on the streets\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to\nsleep on the streets Hairy, I\u2019ll get a hotel\u201d </p><p>He drew his lips into\na tight line and ran his fingers through his hair. </p><p>\u201cCome and stay with\nme\u201d he said almost out of nowhere </p><p>\u201cI just met you\u201d </p><p>\u201cAnd? I\u2019m barely home\nthe next few weeks anyway, you\u2019ll have the place to yourself for most of the\ntime\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could be a\nmurderer\u201d She said harshly </p><p>\u201cThat would be bad\nfor publicity\u201d he giggled \u201cHarry Styles lets homeless exchange student into his\nhome, is a much better headline\u201d </p><p>Poppy thought about\nfor a second, \u201cI can\u2019t just come and live with you Harry\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s only three\nweeks\u201d he sighed \u201cYou\u2019ll have your own bedroom, bathroom, living room, the only\ntime you\u2019ll have to see me is when you\u2019re hungry\u201d </p><p>\u201cI get hungry a lot\u201d\nPoppy said</p><p>\u201cMe too\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can eat together\nthen. Plus the way my schedule looks right now, I\u2019ll hardly be around\u201d </p><p>\u201cI still don\u2019t know\u201d </p><p>\u201cI promise everything\nwill be ok, but if don\u2019t want to stay with me at least let me find you a hotel\nto stay in\u201d </p><p>\u201cFine\u201d Poppy agreed\n\u201cI\u2019ll stay, but only for a few days while I sort this whole thing out\u201d </p><p>\u201cGreat!!\u201d Harry\nexclaimed \u201cLet\u2019s head off then, if we go now we\u2019ll hit traffic, but we should\navoid paparazzi looking for a scoop\u201d he said standing up and throwing his\nbackpack over his shoulder before picking up Poppy\u2019s suitcase</p><p>\u201cAhh\u201d she nodded\n\u201cthat\u2019s why you\u2019re here so early\u201d</p><p>Harry nodded \u201cthat\nand my flight got in early so I didn\u2019t have much choice in the matter\u201d </p><p>It took Poppy more\nthan a few days to sort everything out. Three weeks turned into four and before\nshe knew it she\u2019d been living with Harry for two months. Like he said, he\nwasn\u2019t home much, but she got the feeling that when he was, he enjoyed having\nher around. It didn\u2019t take long for the strangers in an airport coffee shop to\nbecome friends and it was a friendship that would last a lifetime. </p>",

She knew she wouldn\u2019t miss them that much compared to the rest of\nher family that she was used to seeing everyday, but part of her heart would\nstill ache for them time to time, and it felt wrong saying goodbye to everyone\nelse without mentioning them. \u00a0</p><p>Poppy\u2019s dad wasn\u2019t\nthe best at goodbyes either, and by the time Poppy got round to him he was\nalready a mess. </p><p>\u201cJust don\u2019t do\nanything stupid while you\u2019re over there Pop, I won\u2019t be just around the corner\nto come and rescue you\u201d he said </p><p>\u201cWhen have you ever\nhad to do that here Dad?\u201d she giggled </p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a first for\neverything\u201d </p><p>Poppy rolled her eyes\nand hugged her dad one last time \u201cI\u2019ll see you at christmas Dad, Love you\u201d </p><p>\u201cI love you too Pop.\u201d\nAnd with that Poppy turned and walked through the departures gate. She was in a\ndaze as she passed through security because she couldn\u2019t quite believe that\nthis was really happening. A dream she\u2019d had since she was 15 was unfolding\nright in front of her eyes but there was a bittersweetness to it. Everything\nshe\u2019d ever dreamed of was at the other end of this plane journey, but she\u2019d\njust said goodbye to everything she\u2019d ever known and she knew she\u2019d miss home. </p><p>There was still an\nhour left before Poppy\u2019s plane was set to leave the runway so once she\u2019d found\nher gate and knew where she had to go, Poppy found the nearest coffee shop and\nordered herself a peppermint tea to try and calm her nerves. She wanted a\ncoffee, but after living off it for weeks during her final high school exams\nshe made a rule for herself that she was only allowed one cup a week, and she\nfigured that it was best reserved for after she lands. The hot tea washed over\nher tongue and she felt more relaxed almost instantly. She watched as the world\nwent by for the next hour, watching as people went off on their holidays or\nleft for their work trips, Poppy liked to give each person a story. The girl\nwith the red suitcase was going to New York, to start a job as a journalist at\nsome big magazine, Cosmo maybe. The man in the suit was flying to Hong Kong for\nbusiness but he would also get to his family while he\u2019s there. The group of\ngirls squealing next to her were off on their Gap Year Trip to europe, they\nmight even be on the same flight as her, although she hoped that they would be\nsitting far away from her. The family in the corner of the cafe were off on a\nquick trip to Bali because flights were cheap and they needed to get away from\nhumdrum of city life. </p><p>Poppy\u2019s thoughts were\ninterrupted by a voice over the intercom calling for her to board her flight.\nSo she picked up her duffle bag and her boarding pass and made her way to her\ngate. Tears filled her eyes as she walked and it took everything in her not to\nturn around and walk right back into her comfort zone, but she breathed deeply\nand handed her pass to the light attendant at who stood next to the tunnel that\nlead to the plane. </p><p>\u201cHave a nice flight\u201d\nshe said kindly and Poppy smiled at her.</p><p>***</p><p>March 3rd, 7am\nLondon, UK. </p><p>Poppy never realised\njust how far away from the rest of the world she had been until she landed at\nHeathrow Airport and everything crumbled in front of her as she read the email\nthat came through when she connected to the Starbucks Wifi as she waited for\nher much needed coffee. </p><p><i>\u201cDear Miss Thomas </i></p><p><i>Unfortunately, the\napartment that you have secured for rent will now be unavailable until 31/3/13\nas it is currently unfit to live in.

She hated crowds, she hated flying and\nshe hated goodbyes. &nbsp;But here she was, in the middle of Sydney Airport,\nsaying goodbye to her family about to board the plane that was going to take\nher to her new life in London. Nervous was an understatement, not only was she\nabout to be sitting in a giant metal box that could fall out of the sky at any\ngiven moment for the next 28 hours, but when she landed she would be starting\nher whole life fresh and that was equally as terrifying. </p><p>Her Mother&rsquo;s warm\narms wrapped and her and tears formed in Poppy&rsquo;s eyes and as hard as she tried\nto choke them back, she knew they were going to fall. </p><p>&ldquo;Call me when you\nland, won&rsquo;t you Pop?&rdquo; her Mum said, tears filling her eyes too. </p><p>&ldquo;Of course Mum&rdquo; Poppy\nsmiled, &ldquo;You know I will&rdquo; </p><p>They both let go of\nthe hug they were so tightly embraced in and Poppy moved on to say goodbye to\nher little sister, Addison</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget about\nme while you&rsquo;re over there&rdquo; Addie said, trying to play it off as a joke </p><p>&ldquo;I could never&rdquo; Poppy\nreplied mimicking her tone. &ldquo;Tell Kai and Susie I said goodbye too, yeah?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah&rdquo; Addie nodded.\nKai was Poppy&rsquo;s older brother and Susie was his wife, they lived together in\nMelbourne and said their proper goodbyes to Poppy the last time she&rsquo;d been down\nto visit them. She knew she wouldn&rsquo;t miss them that much compared to the rest of\nher family that she was used to seeing everyday, but part of her heart would\nstill ache for them time to time, and it felt wrong saying goodbye to everyone\nelse without mentioning them. &nbsp;</p><p>Poppy&rsquo;s dad wasn&rsquo;t\nthe best at goodbyes either, and by the time Poppy got round to him he was\nalready a mess. </p><p>&ldquo;Just don&rsquo;t do\nanything stupid while you&rsquo;re over there Pop, I won&rsquo;t be just around the corner\nto come and rescue you&rdquo; he said </p><p>&ldquo;When have you ever\nhad to do that here Dad?&rdquo; she giggled </p><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a first for\neverything&rdquo; </p><p>Poppy rolled her eyes\nand hugged her dad one last time &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see you at christmas Dad, Love you&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I love you too Pop.&rdquo;\nAnd with that Poppy turned and walked through the departures gate. She was in a\ndaze as she passed through security because she couldn&rsquo;t quite believe that\nthis was really happening. A dream she&rsquo;d had since she was 15 was unfolding\nright in front of her eyes but there was a bittersweetness to it. Everything\nshe&rsquo;d ever dreamed of was at the other end of this plane journey, but she&rsquo;d\njust said goodbye to everything she&rsquo;d ever known and she knew she&rsquo;d miss home. </p><p>There was still an\nhour left before Poppy&rsquo;s plane was set to leave the runway so once she&rsquo;d found\nher gate and knew where she had to go, Poppy found the nearest coffee shop and\nordered herself a peppermint tea to try and calm her nerves. She wanted a\ncoffee, but after living off it for weeks during her final high school exams\nshe made a rule for herself that she was only allowed one cup a week, and she\nfigured that it was best reserved for after she lands. The hot tea washed over\nher tongue and she felt more relaxed almost instantly. She watched as the world\nwent by for the next hour, watching as people went off on their holidays or\nleft for their work trips, Poppy liked to give each person a story. The girl\nwith the red suitcase was going to New York, to start a job as a journalist at\nsome big magazine, Cosmo maybe. The man in the suit was flying to Hong Kong for\nbusiness but he would also get to his family while he&rsquo;s there. The group of\ngirls squealing next to her were off on their Gap Year Trip to europe, they\nmight even be on the same flight as her, although she hoped that they would be\nsitting far away from her. The family in the corner of the cafe were off on a\nquick trip to Bali because flights were cheap and they needed to get away from\nhumdrum of city life. </p><p>Poppy&rsquo;s thoughts were\ninterrupted by a voice over the intercom calling for her to board her flight.\nSo she picked up her duffle bag and her boarding pass and made her way to her\ngate. Tears filled her eyes as she walked and it took everything in her not to\nturn around and walk right back into her comfort zone, but she breathed deeply\nand handed her pass to the light attendant at who stood next to the tunnel that\nlead to the plane. </p><p>&ldquo;Have a nice flight&rdquo;\nshe said kindly and Poppy smiled at her.</p><p>***</p><p>March 3rd, 7am\nLondon, UK. </p><p>Poppy never realised\njust how far away from the rest of the world she had been until she landed at\nHeathrow Airport and everything crumbled in front of her as she read the email\nthat came through when she connected to the Starbucks Wifi as she waited for\nher much needed coffee. </p><p><i>&ldquo;Dear Miss Thomas </i></p><p><i>Unfortunately, the\napartment that you have secured for rent will now be unavailable until 31/3/13\nas it is currently unfit to live in. The apartment will be fumigated and we\nwill keep you updated on when it is safe for you to move in. &nbsp;We apologise\nfor any inconvenience that this will cause and wish you well with your travels.\nDon&rsquo;t hesitate to contact us with any enquiries you may have. </i></p><p><i>Iris Goodall,\nRelocations Manager.&rdquo;</i></p><p>Home was half a world\naway, and Poppy was out of her depths. She was 19, in a foreign country with no\nplace to go and all she wanted right now was a hug from her mum. In her haze of\nstress, she didn&rsquo;t notice what had been going on around her or that her name\nhad been called several times signalling that her coffee was ready. </p><p>&ldquo;Are you Poopy&rdquo; a\ntall brunette boy with a husky British accent asked, tearing her away from her\nweb search of cheap hotels in London </p><p>&ldquo;No&rdquo; she said quietly\n&ldquo;but I am Poppy&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;One letter off,\nthat&rsquo;s not bad for a Starbucks this busy&rdquo;he handed her the drink and smiled a\nlazy half smile that made her blush &ldquo;speaking of busy, you mind if I sit here?&rdquo;\n</p><p>&ldquo;Go for it&rdquo; Poppy\nsaid, returning to her search. The boy didn&rsquo;t say much else for a while but\nPoppy couldn&rsquo;t help but recognise his face. She didn&rsquo;t know where from, but his\nwild curls and green eyes looked familiar, but how could they be? He was\nclearly British and if she&rsquo;d met him before she would have remembered. It\nwasn&rsquo;t until she read the name on his cup that it all clicked</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re that kid from\nthat band!&rdquo; She exclaimed louder than she intended causing a few people around\nthem to turn and stare. The boy waved them off nervously, thankful that they\nwere mostly middle aged men who wouldn&rsquo;t give two cents about the band he was\nin. </p><p>&ldquo;I am&rdquo; he said much\nquieter &ldquo;but I prefer to go by Harry&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Or Hairy&rdquo; Poppy said\npointing to his drink </p><p>&ldquo;Hairy and Poopy, I\nlike it&rdquo; Harry smiled. &ldquo;So what brings you to London?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m moving here for\nuniversity, I got a scholarship to come here all expenses paid but I&rsquo;ve got an\nemail to say that I&rsquo;ve got nowhere to live for three weeks&rdquo; </p><p>Harry crumpled his\neyebrows &ldquo;Shouldn&rsquo;t they arrange something for you if things fell through?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Poppy\nsighed &ldquo;maybe&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Can I see the\nemail?&rdquo; He asked, looking towards her phone. She nodded and unlocked it and\nhanded it to him with the email already open. His brows crumpled again as he\nread it. </p><p>&ldquo;They can&rsquo;t just let\nyou be homeless for three weeks,they should get you a hotel,I&rsquo;ll call them for\nyou if you like, get it all sorted?&rdquo; </p><p>Poppy was taken aback\nby his kindness, it wasn&rsquo;t something she expected from a random stranger let\nalone a stranger as famous as him. </p><p>&ldquo;No no that&rsquo;s fine&rdquo;\nshe said &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll figure something out&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Poopy, I don&rsquo;t know\nhow much you know about London in March, but the weather can be somewhat\nsporadic, you can&rsquo;t sleep on the streets&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to\nsleep on the streets Hairy, I&rsquo;ll get a hotel&rdquo; </p><p>He drew his lips into\na tight line and ran his fingers through his hair. </p><p>&ldquo;Come and stay with\nme&rdquo; he said almost out of nowhere </p><p>&ldquo;I just met you&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;And?

Harry and Y/N had been dating for 2 months. Everyone knew Harry moved fast and nobody would even give it a second glance if he was one of those celebrities that got married after 6 months of dating. Y/N, on the other hand, was quite the opposite. She wasn\u2019t one to commit quickly. I mean it did take Harry almost 6 months to make her say yes to being exclusive with him. He can still remember every detail of the day she had finally gave in and said yes.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHarry? Why is it so damn dark in here?\u201d Y/n said tossing her keys down onto the fancy side table in the entrance of his house that she told him was too expensive but he, of course, insisted it went with his aesthetic. She walked in flipping on a bunch of lights and there he was sitting on the couch in a full suit with that annoyingly beautiful dimpled grin. 100 long stem roses set out in 10 different glass vases. \u201cHarrryyy what are you doing\u201d she looks at him fear setting in and honestly all she wanted to do was walk out that door. But she didn\u2019t because she locked eyes with him and she physically couldn\u2019t move. He looked so beautiful standing there in his Gucci suit that he took from a shoot when his manager wasn\u2019t looking even though he could\u2019ve just asked. His hair looks like he\u2019s ran his hands through it 100 times right before she got there because of his nerves. And of course his dimples. Those damn dimples. That\u2019s why she stood there in shock not being able to move. Not really thinking anything until Harry decided to open his mouth. \u201cY/N I know you hate this stuff. And I know you\u2019re terrified right now but I need you to listen. I\u2019ve been chasing you for 6 months. I\u2019ve spent every moment thinking of you. I mean you basically live here! Please please just say you\u2019ll be my girlfriend. You basically are already everyone thinks so ya know!\u201d She sat there thinking still not being able to speak the only thing that ran through her head was her first failed relationship and her parents\u2019 divorces and every failed relationship that she had ever seen. He just stood there giving her time. She watched his eyes try to read hers. She was shaking with fear but the only think that came out of her mouth was \u201calright fine I guess I\u2019ll be your girlfriend\u201d Harry sighed happily and ran to hug her since she still wouldn\u2019t move a bit. He was very thankful after like the 17th time he trapped her into saying yes.\u00a0</p><p>Today was different things had started normally. But boy did nobody expect the day to end the way it did. You see today was 8 months in Harry\u2019s head. 2 months technically from that day Y/N was trapped into saying yes. Looking back, she doesn\u2019t regret it at all and she was happy she took the leap but thinking long-term terrified her. A life with harry terrified her. A life without him terrified her even more. So here we are. Basically in the same place as 2 months ago but things were very different this time. Harry had finally gotten a weekend off and thought of the best idea. Y/N had just finished finals so anything right now sounded like a good idea. \u201cYou know this is the first weekend we have both had off together in a bit we should just say screw it and load up the rover and go to the beach for the weekend? He said watching her give him a tired smile and nod following him to his room which all of her stuff was basically in as well and packed for the beach. After loading up the rover and setting off to the beach it was all smiles. Harry loved nothing more than watching his girl sing along loudly to his music. She always got embarrassed when she caught him watching her because Y/N for sure thought she sounded like a 12-year-old YouTuber who would in a few years delete everything when realizing how bad they were. But Harry thought quite the opposite he always joked about you recording a song with him for his next album. By the time you got there, the sun was going to set but that didn\u2019t bother either of them. Harry parked the Rover at the beach and walked straight down to the water hand holding Y/N\u2019s. After finding a cozy spot Harry felt this would be the most perfect time to say it. You know. Those 3 words. He couldn\u2019t think of a more perfect time. Relaxing on the beach at sunset. It was picture perfect. \u201cY/n I love\u201d that\u2019s all he got out before Y/n\u2019s hand flew up to cover his mouth \u201cdon\u2019t you dare. Don\u2019t say it\u201d she held her hand there and he watched the color drain from her face and her hand shakes just the same it did that day 2 months ago but this time it was different. This time he knew it wouldn\u2019t work. \u201cWe have our whole lives to say that. We have all the time in the world to say it. I don\u2019t want to hurt you harry. Whatever you do don\u2019t say, Love.\u201d He nodded slowly and she moved her hand and he kissed her softly pulling her down to the sand watching the sunset. He may not be able to say it but he definitely felt it and he knew by how scared she was she felt it too.</p>",

He was very thankful after like the 17th time he trapped her into saying yes.\u00a0</p><p>Today was different things had started normally. But boy did nobody expect the day to end the way it did. You see today was 8 months in Harry\u2019s head. 2 months technically from that day Y/N was trapped into saying yes. Looking back, she doesn\u2019t regret it at all and she was happy she took the leap but thinking long-term terrified her. A life with harry terrified her. A life without him terrified her even more. So here we are. Basically in the same place as 2 months ago but things were very different this time. Harry had finally gotten a weekend off and thought of the best idea. Y/N had just finished finals so anything right now sounded like a good idea. \u201cYou know this is the first weekend we have both had off together in a bit we should just say screw it and load up the rover and go to the beach for the weekend? He said watching her give him a tired smile and nod following him to his room which all of her stuff was basically in as well and packed for the beach. After loading up the rover and setting off to the beach it was all smiles. Harry loved nothing more than watching his girl sing along loudly to his music. She always got embarrassed when she caught him watching her because Y/N for sure thought she sounded like a 12-year-old YouTuber who would in a few years delete everything when realizing how bad they were. But Harry thought quite the opposite he always joked about you recording a song with him for his next album. By the time you got there, the sun was going to set but that didn\u2019t bother either of them. Harry parked the Rover at the beach and walked straight down to the water hand holding Y/N\u2019s. After finding a cozy spot Harry felt this would be the most perfect time to say it. You know. Those 3 words. He couldn\u2019t think of a more perfect time. Relaxing on the beach at sunset. It was picture perfect. \u201cY/n I love\u201d that\u2019s all he got out before Y/n\u2019s hand flew up to cover his mouth \u201cdon\u2019t you dare. Don\u2019t say it\u201d she held her hand there and he watched the color drain from her face and her hand shakes just the same it did that day 2 months ago but this time it was different. This time he knew it wouldn\u2019t work. \u201cWe have our whole lives to say that. We have all the time in the world to say it. I don\u2019t want to hurt you harry. Whatever you do don\u2019t say, Love.\u201d He nodded slowly and she moved her hand and he kissed her softly pulling her down to the sand watching the sunset. He may not be able to say it but he definitely felt it and he knew by how scared she was she felt it too.</p></p>",
