You were the only member of the family he\ncould stand to be around, and every year when you went to Hogwarts, he always\npaid regular visits just to make sure you never got too lonely from being away\nfrom home, and it also meant you got to see him, as he wasn\u2019t particularly\nwelcome in the Black Household anymore. </p><!-- more --><p>You were several years his junior. You were nearly half his\nage by the time he attended Hogwarts, so it meant there was a year from him\ngraduating to you also starting your first year there. While you got sorted into\nSlytherin and shared similar thoughts with your parents, you still preferred\nyour brother\u2019s presence, and listened to what he had to say on the topic of\nblood purity, and let it slip that the whole thing was boring for you. It made\nSirius laugh a little. </p><p>You\u2019d gone back home just a week ago, since it was school\nbreak, and while Sirius missed your presence, he didn\u2019t complain. You were in\nyour last year in Hogwarts after 4 successful years, and you were nearing the\nend of your 5<sup>th</sup>. Sirius had discussed with you what you planned to\ndo with yourself after graduation, and while you said you\u2019d figure it out in\nyour first, second, third and fourth year\u2026 this year was different. You\u2019d\nactually hinted to liking to move in with him, and more than once. It didn\u2019t\nreally make sense to him- you tried so hard to make your parents proud, and he\nknew that the second you announced you were going to live with him that your\nparents would forbid it, or would disown you as well. It didn\u2019t make sense\nuntil a week into the holiday, when you showed up at his door. </p><p>He didn\u2019t say anything at first sight of you. The sight of\nyou shocked him. How did you get here? More importantly, why did you have a\nlarge suitcase under your arm, and why were you crying? The questions he\ndecided could wait, as he pulled you into his house, closing the door and\nushering you over to the nearest seat. \u201cI\u2019m sorry Sirius- you were the first\nperson I could think of to come to.\u201d You explained to him quickly. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s alright\u2026 what are you doing here? What happened?\u201d He\nasked. You covered your face, almost of embarrassment as another wave of tears\nhit you. It took a minute to get an actual response. </p><p>\u201cT-They kicked me out, Sirius!\u201d You sobbed. That caught\nSirius off guard, making him straighten his back. He knew that while his\ndisownment didn\u2019t matter much to him- he didn\u2019t want to be in that darn family\nin the first place- you had a good relationship with your parents, and he knew\nthat it must be breaking your heart.</p><p>\u201cWhatever for?\u201d He asked, bewildered on what could have\ncaused this. Had you let slip your sudden change in plan to move with him? No,\nit was so sudden, and it was clear you were almost ashamed to offer it as an\nidea to him, he doubted you\u2019d tell your mother.</p><p>\u201cT-They found out that I-I\u2026\u201d You struggled for words. He\nknew it wasn\u2019t about moving in with him at this point. You wouldn\u2019t struggle\nwith telling him something he already knew. You took a deep breath in, trying\nto calm yourself. \u201cI-I like a girl, Sirius. I like a girl in Hogwarts. A-At first\nI thought it was purely just because of how nice she was- being a Hufflepuff\nand all\u2026 but then I\u2026 got to know her and\u2026 I don\u2019t just like her as a friend\u2026\u201d\nYou struggled to explain to him. You could barely make eye contact, but when\nyou did, you saw a reassuring smile. A genuine smile. No judgement. </p><p>\u201cDoes my little sister have a crush?\u201d He asked. You laughed\na little at your flustered behaviour. \u201cTell me about her.\u201d He encouraged. You\ndid. You just sat there, telling him about this amazing girl in a yellow scarf,\nand some of the things that made you love her. She was nice to you even though\nyou weren\u2019t only a Slytherin, but also a member of the Black family. She\u2019s\nactually helped you sneak off to Sirius\u2019 house on several occasions by covering\nyou. Hell- she\u2019d spent an entire free day going all around Hogwarts with you\njust to help you find an earring you\u2019d lost the other day. \u201cShe found it and\nclaimed it was because she was a particularly good finder. I don\u2019t know why,\nbut it made me laugh when she said that. She laughed as well\u2026 she\u2019s amazing\nSirius.\u201d You rambled, all while Sirius just grinned. This was the happiest he\u2019d\nseen you\u2026 ever! Your tears had long stopped, though your eyes were still red.\nYou paused, and that\u2019s when you frowned. \u201cMother found out about my crush on a\nHufflepuff girl\u2026 We\u2019d had a picture took together, at a Quidditch match, and\nshe was kissing my cheek\u2026 and on the back, she\u2019d asked me to go to the Yule\nBall with her, and I\u2019d said yes\u2026\u201d You explained. \u201cMother saw it, and she yelled\nat me for it\u2026 I eventually had enough and told her that I did love her, and\nthat in the past I have had similar feelings for other girls and boys in the\npast, but nothing compared to her. She disowned me right then, telling me to\npack and get out of her house.\u201d You explained. </p><p>\u201cY/N\u2026 I\u2019m glad you came here. You listen to me, alright?\nDoes this girl make you happy?\u201d He asked. You nodded confidently. \u201cThen that\u2019s\nall that matters. You can stay here for as long as you damn want. You enjoy\nyour holiday, and when you get back to that school\u2026 you better properly ask her\nout, you hear me? And invite her over, I want to meet this wonderful girl. I\u2019ll\nhave to help you as well get your dress ready for the ball as well! We\u2019ll knock\ntheir socks off!\u201d Sirius teased you, getting up and pacing to look excited as\nyou became even more flustered, begging him to shut up. </p><hr><p>Hope you like it!

A-At first\nI thought it was purely just because of how nice she was- being a Hufflepuff\nand all\u2026 but then I\u2026 got to know her and\u2026 I don\u2019t just like her as a friend\u2026\u201d\nYou struggled to explain to him. You could barely make eye contact, but when\nyou did, you saw a reassuring smile. A genuine smile. No judgement. </p><p>\u201cDoes my little sister have a crush?\u201d He asked. You laughed\na little at your flustered behaviour. \u201cTell me about her.\u201d He encouraged. You\ndid. You just sat there, telling him about this amazing girl in a yellow scarf,\nand some of the things that made you love her. She was nice to you even though\nyou weren\u2019t only a Slytherin, but also a member of the Black family. She\u2019s\nactually helped you sneak off to Sirius\u2019 house on several occasions by covering\nyou. Hell- she\u2019d spent an entire free day going all around Hogwarts with you\njust to help you find an earring you\u2019d lost the other day. \u201cShe found it and\nclaimed it was because she was a particularly good finder. I don\u2019t know why,\nbut it made me laugh when she said that. She laughed as well\u2026 she\u2019s amazing\nSirius.\u201d You rambled, all while Sirius just grinned. This was the happiest he\u2019d\nseen you\u2026 ever! Your tears had long stopped, though your eyes were still red.\nYou paused, and that\u2019s when you frowned. \u201cMother found out about my crush on a\nHufflepuff girl\u2026 We\u2019d had a picture took together, at a Quidditch match, and\nshe was kissing my cheek\u2026 and on the back, she\u2019d asked me to go to the Yule\nBall with her, and I\u2019d said yes\u2026\u201d You explained. \u201cMother saw it, and she yelled\nat me for it\u2026 I eventually had enough and told her that I did love her, and\nthat in the past I have had similar feelings for other girls and boys in the\npast, but nothing compared to her. She disowned me right then, telling me to\npack and get out of her house.\u201d You explained. </p><p>\u201cY/N\u2026 I\u2019m glad you came here. You listen to me, alright?\nDoes this girl make you happy?\u201d He asked. You nodded confidently. \u201cThen that\u2019s\nall that matters. You can stay here for as long as you damn want. You enjoy\nyour holiday, and when you get back to that school\u2026 you better properly ask her\nout, you hear me? And invite her over, I want to meet this wonderful girl. I\u2019ll\nhave to help you as well get your dress ready for the ball as well! We\u2019ll knock\ntheir socks off!\u201d Sirius teased you, getting up and pacing to look excited as\nyou became even more flustered, begging him to shut up. </p><hr><p>Hope you like it!

Your tears had long stopped, though your eyes were still red.\nYou paused, and that&rsquo;s when you frowned. &ldquo;Mother found out about my crush on a\nHufflepuff girl&hellip; We&rsquo;d had a picture took together, at a Quidditch match, and\nshe was kissing my cheek&hellip; and on the back, she&rsquo;d asked me to go to the Yule\nBall with her, and I&rsquo;d said yes&hellip;&rdquo; You explained. &ldquo;Mother saw it, and she yelled\nat me for it&hellip; I eventually had enough and told her that I did love her, and\nthat in the past I have had similar feelings for other girls and boys in the\npast, but nothing compared to her. She disowned me right then, telling me to\npack and get out of her house.&rdquo; You explained. </p><p>&ldquo;Y/N&hellip; I&rsquo;m glad you came here. You listen to me, alright?\nDoes this girl make you happy?&rdquo; He asked. You nodded confidently. &ldquo;Then that&rsquo;s\nall that matters. You can stay here for as long as you damn want. You enjoy\nyour holiday, and when you get back to that school&hellip; you better properly ask her\nout, you hear me? And invite her over, I want to meet this wonderful girl. I&rsquo;ll\nhave to help you as well get your dress ready for the ball as well! We&rsquo;ll knock\ntheir socks off!&rdquo; Sirius teased you, getting up and pacing to look excited as\nyou became even more flustered, begging him to shut up. </p><hr /><p>Hope you like it!

Ron\u2019s hand caressed mine sweetly, trying to say something but then a really blond almost white-haired man appeared. Lucius Malfoy. Draco\u2019s dad, meaning he was then my ex father in law.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not really nice to enter without being invited in private properties\u201d the woman said then, she was obviously mocking us.</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry. It was YOUR MEN who took us here. You then might consider having them, not like we would have wanted to be here in the first place\u201d I spat at her, Lucius shook his head in disbelief.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t looking very well as he used to. He looked&hellip; poorer. Like, he had lost everything and as if somehow he couldn\u2019t manage to sleep well at night. I couldn\u2019t believe for the first time in years I was feeling sorry for that horrible man, who had put constantly up in trouble my friends and his son. </p><p>\u201cY/N, I would suggest you to shut up for once\u201d it\u2019s all that he said. Was he advising me? Or was he trying to mock me as well? The first year Draco and I started to have a thing, Lucius used to hate me but as the time flew by, he kind of started to be sweeter. I knew he had ended up liking me as his son\u2019s girlfriend, that was why I wasn\u2019t getting his message.</p><p>The woman looked at us. \u201cI honestly don\u2019t like you\u201d she said before started screaming and laughing loudly. I swear I had seen her somewhere, I just couldn\u2019t recall where. Her laughing became really strong to my ears, and it started to be hopelessly annoying. I looked up at Ron, we were both honestly scared. Knowingly that the Malfoy\u2019s were Death Eaters and this woman seemed as she was crazy&hellip;</p><p>She was crazy.</p><p>She had been in Azkaban, for sure.</p><p>She had to be Bellatrix Lestrange.</p><p>Something clicked inside me. I had then a reason to be scared. She had killed his own cousin, I was pretty much sure she\u2019d kill us without even blinking. Bellatrix was known as the most loyal server to Voldemort. </p><p>And I knew that somehow she knew what I was thinking and she took advantage of it. \u201cSo you know now who I am&hellip; Are you scared, princess?\u201d She came across the room to face me, and her wand caressed my cheekbone. She was being gentle, but I knew I had to be scared. I couldn\u2019t get my wand at that moment and Ron couldn\u2019t either. His hand left mine. \u201cSuch a shame Draco dated you&hellip; And that you\u2019re dating a Weasley now.\u201d</p><p>There were loads of things I would like to have said to her. But I tried to keep my mouth shut. It was very short after her last sentence where she spoke up what could have been the end of me. She looked at me, took a few steps aside, and waved her wand again in the air&hellip; this time saying \u2018<i>crucio\u2019</i>. </p><p>I kneeled down instantly, feeling the worst pain I could ever have felt. Not even recalling have felt something so painful when I fell down of my groom at a Quidditch game or even after having fallen down a mountain when climbing it. That was definitely something else. It felt like a million sharp knives pointing at me and slowly entering in my skin and my body.</p><p>I didn\u2019t even realize I was screaming my lungs out. The pain I was feeling was so intense, I tried to open my eyes to look for Ron and tried to say that I was fine, just for him to calm down at least but I couldn\u2019t. And I tried to think of Draco, I tried to think of our first kiss hidden in the Astronomy Tower back in Hogwarts, out first date that was a trip to \u00a0Hogsmade that ended up being a complete disaster but really funny, the first time he had told me his real feelings towards me, when he had asked me to be his girlfriend and the first time we made love. Even I tried to think of all those times we would sneak around and get into each other\u2019s common rooms or even dormitories . </p><p>The air was hot, and I felt like I was going to burst or even worse, that I\u2019d be burned as a witch. And I would have rather that she had just burned me alive instead of feeling that pain. I tried to open my eyes, to fight the curse. I couldn\u2019t. Inside of my head, back then, after all my feelings, all the pain and hurt I was being reminded of Neville\u2019s parents. If she kept doing that, I\u2019d end up as insane as them. What I was feeling was beyond any pain I could have ever felt, and somehow I found myself looking up and seeing Ron with tears in his eyes.</p><p>My throat was sore, probably from all the screaming I would have been on. And everything went black, and somehow the curse had stopped. Someone was running towards me, I tried to move but I couldn\u2019t. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, princess. Are you alright? I know you\u2019re not. Merlin, We only have two minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDraco?\u201d was all that I could say. \u201cI can\u2019t see a thing\u201d I mumbled.</p><p>\u201cI know, when the light comes out again, the time will be on as well. We need to make it out of here. Ron\u2019s waiting for us. Come on, princess, I know you can do this. You can move\u201d and hearing that he had cared even for saving Ron made my heart flutter in so many ways. I tried to move but it was really difficult, the struggle was being very visible. He came to me and he lift me up with his arms to make our way out but when we reached the door, the light came on again. </p><p>And I fell onto the ground after Draco. He was screaming, he had been hit with the Cruciatus Curse. And it wasn\u2019t going to happen right in front of my eyes, I would never watch him go as crazy as he was going. I tried not to cry, as I lift my wand and pointed at Bellatrix before cursing her \u201c<i>Imperio</i>\u201d. She instantly left Draco alone, he stopped screaming and somehow he could get up. I didn\u2019t even know where I had got my strength from, but I just did. I felt as if I had been born again. \u201cYou are going to let me leave with Ron\u201d I said harshly at her. \u201cAnd you\u2019ll leave us alone for a while, you will not order anyone to follow us\u201d I said, and as I was talking Lucius Malfoy had his wand pointing at me, he was about to cast a spell.</p><p>\u201cExpelliarmus! Don\u2019t you ever dare to touch her, dad\u201d and Lucius\u2019 wand flied to the other side of the big room. I hadn\u2019t even recognized that we were at the Malfoy\u2019s manor.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not leaving!\u201d that\u2019s all that Lucius said, he wasn\u2019t talking to me. He was talking to Draco, he looked at me then. </p><p>\u201cYes, I am.\u201d</p><p>I lowered my wand, and we left almost running, we had been now walking for while. We were fairly away from his manor. Ron had his hands tugged inside his pockets and he let one out to run it through his hair. \u201cI didn\u2019t know you\u2019d have the balls\u201d he admitted. Draco smiled at Ron\u2019s words. Could that possibly be happening? Well, it was.</p><p>\u201cYou need to rest, princess\u201d Draco said then. </p><p>Ron was walking ahead of us, Draco instead was beside me. Ron turned around to look at me, and I don\u2019t know what he thought in that exact moment but the words he said then made my heart flutter once more. \u201cLet\u2019s go to the Headquarters\u201d. Knowing how much he had hated Draco, or how much he still hated him, the fact that he was inviting him said a lot. He saw me smile, and added \u201cthat doesn\u2019t mean I trust you, but after you saved my life&hellip;\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe did\u201d Draco snapped at Ron. I giggled then because I knew him well enough to know that he didn\u2019t mean to be mean at that exact moment, he just didn\u2019t want to talk. </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say that, you wouldn\u2019t have been able to have left Ron behind even if you deeply have wanted to. And I\u2019d be dead if it wasn\u2019t for you\u201d he looked at me, he was puzzled.</p><p>\u201cMy dad wouldn\u2019t&hellip;\u201d but he knew deep inside that I was right, that his father would have killed me and I didn\u2019t want to push it because it wasn\u2019t his fault. </p><p>I changed the subject. \u201cAre you sure you want to be with us?\u201d</p><p>He just nodded.</p><p>\u201cYou have a lot of explaining to do, Malfoy\u201d Ron spoke up. </p><p>\u201cNot now, Ron\u201d I mumbled, \u201che\u2019s just been casted the cruciatus curse, let him rest.\u201d</p><p>Ron\u2019s face flinched. \u201cFor like what?! Five seconds?! You\u2019ve been casted that fucking shit half an hour, you could have died!\u201d he was angry, and I didn\u2019t blame him. If I had been the one to have had to watch Ron been cursed, I would have probably be as mad as him. And to be fairly honest, he was being very nice. I\u2019d have just burst into emotions. I knew he had felt useless, watching me there and being unable to do a thing.</p><p>\u201cI need to rest too&hellip;\u201d I smiled and walked up at him, I grabbed then his hand and he hugged me. We started walking with our hands intertwined. \u201cI\u2019m fine, we\u2019re fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was so scared\u201d he stated fixing his eyes on me, \u201cwhat made you keep control? It looked like sometimes you could somehow ease the pain.\u201d</p><p>I blushed. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>After a lot of walking, we arrived to the Headquarters. Draco was following behind. We went upstairs, and Ron left to his room and I showed Draco were he could sleep. I knew there was a lot to be said, but we all needed to sleep first.</p><p>Once he sat down onto the bed, I spoke up. \u201cYou\u2019ve been really quiet, are you okay? Do you need anything?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head so I nodded and made my way to the door, but before I could open it, Draco was already in front of me not letting me pass. \u201cCan you stay&hellip; with me?\u201d he asked it looking down at the floor. Somehow I managed to smile.</p><p>\u201cYes, sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course if Ron doesn\u2019t mind&hellip;\u201d</p><p>I giggled. \u201cWhy would he?\u201d</p><p>Draco frowned his eyebrows as I lied on the bed. \u201cAren\u2019t you two&hellip; together?\u201d I shook my head giggling again. He dropped the subject once he got the answer he wanted. \u201cWhat made you not lose it?\u201d</p><p>Of course he would have seen me blushing back when Ron had asked this and he had been curious. He lied down beside me, \u201cI don\u2019t know, I really was trying to think of you and everything we used to do when we were together\u201d he smiled even though he knew he shouldn\u2019t have. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot to be said, but it can wait until tomorrow. Just sleep\u201d I said to him, he was already closing his eyes, he just wrapped his arms around my body.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t leave\u201d was all that he said. \u201cDon\u2019t leave <i>me</i>.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t, I\u2019ll be here when you wake up. I promise.\u201d</p><p>He kissed my temple with his eyes closed, and I let myself be wrapped up in his arms. I loved that feeling. I knew there was a lot to be said, but I wanted to be between his arms once more for a little while.</p><p><b><a href=\"http://suburbiasqueen.tumblr.com/post/177533657216/pain-2-draco-malfoy\">Part 2</a></b></p>",

Draco\u2019s dad, meaning he was then my ex father in law.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not really nice to enter without being invited in private properties\u201d the woman said then, she was obviously mocking us.</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry. It was YOUR MEN who took us here. You then might consider having them, not like we would have wanted to be here in the first place\u201d I spat at her, Lucius shook his head in disbelief.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t looking very well as he used to. He looked\u2026 poorer. Like, he had lost everything and as if somehow he couldn\u2019t manage to sleep well at night. I couldn\u2019t believe for the first time in years I was feeling sorry for that horrible man, who had put constantly up in trouble my friends and his son. </p><p>\u201cY/N, I would suggest you to shut up for once\u201d it\u2019s all that he said. Was he advising me? Or was he trying to mock me as well? The first year Draco and I started to have a thing, Lucius used to hate me but as the time flew by, he kind of started to be sweeter. I knew he had ended up liking me as his son\u2019s girlfriend, that was why I wasn\u2019t getting his message.</p><p>The woman looked at us. \u201cI honestly don\u2019t like you\u201d she said before started screaming and laughing loudly. I swear I had seen her somewhere, I just couldn\u2019t recall where. Her laughing became really strong to my ears, and it started to be hopelessly annoying. I looked up at Ron, we were both honestly scared. Knowingly that the Malfoy\u2019s were Death Eaters and this woman seemed as she was crazy\u2026</p><p>She was crazy.</p><p>She had been in Azkaban, for sure.</p><p>She had to be Bellatrix Lestrange.</p><p>Something clicked inside me. I had then a reason to be scared. She had killed his own cousin, I was pretty much sure she\u2019d kill us without even blinking. Bellatrix was known as the most loyal server to Voldemort. </p><p>And I knew that somehow she knew what I was thinking and she took advantage of it. \u201cSo you know now who I am\u2026 Are you scared, princess?\u201d She came across the room to face me, and her wand caressed my cheekbone. She was being gentle, but I knew I had to be scared. I couldn\u2019t get my wand at that moment and Ron couldn\u2019t either. His hand left mine. \u201cSuch a shame Draco dated you\u2026 And that you\u2019re dating a Weasley now.\u201d</p><p>There were loads of things I would like to have said to her. But I tried to keep my mouth shut. It was very short after her last sentence where she spoke up what could have been the end of me. She looked at me, took a few steps aside, and waved her wand again in the air\u2026 this time saying \u2018<i>crucio\u2019</i>. </p><p>I kneeled down instantly, feeling the worst pain I could ever have felt. Not even recalling have felt something so painful when I fell down of my groom at a Quidditch game or even after having fallen down a mountain when climbing it. That was definitely something else. It felt like a million sharp knives pointing at me and slowly entering in my skin and my body.</p><p>I didn\u2019t even realize I was screaming my lungs out. The pain I was feeling was so intense, I tried to open my eyes to look for Ron and tried to say that I was fine, just for him to calm down at least but I couldn\u2019t. And I tried to think of Draco, I tried to think of our first kiss hidden in the Astronomy Tower back in Hogwarts, out first date that was a trip to \u00a0Hogsmade that ended up being a complete disaster but really funny, the first time he had told me his real feelings towards me, when he had asked me to be his girlfriend and the first time we made love. Even I tried to think of all those times we would sneak around and get into each other\u2019s common rooms or even dormitories . </p><p>The air was hot, and I felt like I was going to burst or even worse, that I\u2019d be burned as a witch. And I would have rather that she had just burned me alive instead of feeling that pain. I tried to open my eyes, to fight the curse. I couldn\u2019t. Inside of my head, back then, after all my feelings, all the pain and hurt I was being reminded of Neville\u2019s parents. If she kept doing that, I\u2019d end up as insane as them. What I was feeling was beyond any pain I could have ever felt, and somehow I found myself looking up and seeing Ron with tears in his eyes.</p><p>My throat was sore, probably from all the screaming I would have been on. And everything went black, and somehow the curse had stopped. Someone was running towards me, I tried to move but I couldn\u2019t. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, princess. Are you alright? I know you\u2019re not. Merlin, We only have two minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDraco?\u201d was all that I could say. \u201cI can\u2019t see a thing\u201d I mumbled.</p><p>\u201cI know, when the light comes out again, the time will be on as well. We need to make it out of here. Ron\u2019s waiting for us. Come on, princess, I know you can do this. You can move\u201d and hearing that he had cared even for saving Ron made my heart flutter in so many ways. I tried to move but it was really difficult, the struggle was being very visible. He came to me and he lift me up with his arms to make our way out but when we reached the door, the light came on again. </p><p>And I fell onto the ground after Draco. He was screaming, he had been hit with the Cruciatus Curse. And it wasn\u2019t going to happen right in front of my eyes, I would never watch him go as crazy as he was going. I tried not to cry, as I lift my wand and pointed at Bellatrix before cursing her \u201c<i>Imperio</i>\u201d. She instantly left Draco alone, he stopped screaming and somehow he could get up. I didn\u2019t even know where I had got my strength from, but I just did. I felt as if I had been born again. \u201cYou are going to let me leave with Ron\u201d I said harshly at her. \u201cAnd you\u2019ll leave us alone for a while, you will not order anyone to follow us\u201d I said, and as I was talking Lucius Malfoy had his wand pointing at me, he was about to cast a spell.</p><p>\u201cExpelliarmus! Don\u2019t you ever dare to touch her, dad\u201d and Lucius\u2019 wand flied to the other side of the big room. I hadn\u2019t even recognized that we were at the Malfoy\u2019s manor.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not leaving!\u201d that\u2019s all that Lucius said, he wasn\u2019t talking to me. He was talking to Draco, he looked at me then. </p><p>\u201cYes, I am.\u201d</p><p>I lowered my wand, and we left almost running, we had been now walking for while. We were fairly away from his manor. Ron had his hands tugged inside his pockets and he let one out to run it through his hair. \u201cI didn\u2019t know you\u2019d have the balls\u201d he admitted. Draco smiled at Ron\u2019s words. Could that possibly be happening? Well, it was.</p><p>\u201cYou need to rest, princess\u201d Draco said then. </p><p>Ron was walking ahead of us, Draco instead was beside me. Ron turned around to look at me, and I don\u2019t know what he thought in that exact moment but the words he said then made my heart flutter once more. \u201cLet\u2019s go to the Headquarters\u201d. Knowing how much he had hated Draco, or how much he still hated him, the fact that he was inviting him said a lot. He saw me smile, and added \u201cthat doesn\u2019t mean I trust you, but after you saved my life\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe did\u201d Draco snapped at Ron. I giggled then because I knew him well enough to know that he didn\u2019t mean to be mean at that exact moment, he just didn\u2019t want to talk. </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say that, you wouldn\u2019t have been able to have left Ron behind even if you deeply have wanted to. And I\u2019d be dead if it wasn\u2019t for you\u201d he looked at me, he was puzzled.</p><p>\u201cMy dad wouldn\u2019t\u2026\u201d but he knew deep inside that I was right, that his father would have killed me and I didn\u2019t want to push it because it wasn\u2019t his fault. </p><p>I changed the subject. \u201cAre you sure you want to be with us?\u201d</p><p>He just nodded.</p><p>\u201cYou have a lot of explaining to do, Malfoy\u201d Ron spoke up. </p><p>\u201cNot now, Ron\u201d I mumbled, \u201che\u2019s just been casted the cruciatus curse, let him rest.\u201d</p><p>Ron\u2019s face flinched. \u201cFor like what?! Five seconds?! You\u2019ve been casted that fucking shit half an hour, you could have died!\u201d he was angry, and I didn\u2019t blame him. If I had been the one to have had to watch Ron been cursed, I would have probably be as mad as him. And to be fairly honest, he was being very nice. I\u2019d have just burst into emotions. I knew he had felt useless, watching me there and being unable to do a thing.</p><p>\u201cI need to rest too\u2026\u201d I smiled and walked up at him, I grabbed then his hand and he hugged me. We started walking with our hands intertwined. \u201cI\u2019m fine, we\u2019re fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was so scared\u201d he stated fixing his eyes on me, \u201cwhat made you keep control? It looked like sometimes you could somehow ease the pain.\u201d</p><p>I blushed. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>After a lot of walking, we arrived to the Headquarters. Draco was following behind. We went upstairs, and Ron left to his room and I showed Draco were he could sleep. I knew there was a lot to be said, but we all needed to sleep first.</p><p>Once he sat down onto the bed, I spoke up. \u201cYou\u2019ve been really quiet, are you okay? Do you need anything?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head so I nodded and made my way to the door, but before I could open it, Draco was already in front of me not letting me pass. \u201cCan you stay\u2026 with me?\u201d he asked it looking down at the floor. Somehow I managed to smile.</p><p>\u201cYes, sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course if Ron doesn\u2019t mind\u2026\u201d</p><p>I giggled. \u201cWhy would he?\u201d</p><p>Draco frowned his eyebrows as I lied on the bed. \u201cAren\u2019t you two\u2026 together?\u201d I shook my head giggling again. He dropped the subject once he got the answer he wanted. \u201cWhat made you not lose it?\u201d</p><p>Of course he would have seen me blushing back when Ron had asked this and he had been curious. He lied down beside me, \u201cI don\u2019t know, I really was trying to think of you and everything we used to do when we were together\u201d he smiled even though he knew he shouldn\u2019t have. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot to be said, but it can wait until tomorrow. Just sleep\u201d I said to him, he was already closing his eyes, he just wrapped his arms around my body.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t leave\u201d was all that he said. \u201cDon\u2019t leave <i>me</i>.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t, I\u2019ll be here when you wake up. I promise.\u201d</p><p>He kissed my temple with his eyes closed, and I let myself be wrapped up in his arms. I loved that feeling. I knew there was a lot to be said, but I wanted to be between his arms once more for a little while.</p><p><b><a href=\"http://suburbiasqueen.tumblr.com/post/177533657216/pain-2-draco-malfoy\">Part 2</a></b></p></p>",

And I\u2019d be dead if it wasn\u2019t for you\u201d he looked at me, he was puzzled.</p><p>\u201cMy dad wouldn\u2019t\u2026\u201d but he knew deep inside that I was right, that his father would have killed me and I didn\u2019t want to push it because it wasn\u2019t his fault. </p><p>I changed the subject. \u201cAre you sure you want to be with us?\u201d</p><p>He just nodded.</p><p>\u201cYou have a lot of explaining to do, Malfoy\u201d Ron spoke up. </p><p>\u201cNot now, Ron\u201d I mumbled, \u201che\u2019s just been casted the cruciatus curse, let him rest.\u201d</p><p>Ron\u2019s face flinched. \u201cFor like what?! Five seconds?! You\u2019ve been casted that fucking shit half an hour, you could have died!\u201d he was angry, and I didn\u2019t blame him. If I had been the one to have had to watch Ron been cursed, I would have probably be as mad as him. And to be fairly honest, he was being very nice. I\u2019d have just burst into emotions. I knew he had felt useless, watching me there and being unable to do a thing.</p><p>\u201cI need to rest too\u2026\u201d I smiled and walked up at him, I grabbed then his hand and he hugged me. We started walking with our hands intertwined. \u201cI\u2019m fine, we\u2019re fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was so scared\u201d he stated fixing his eyes on me, \u201cwhat made you keep control? It looked like sometimes you could somehow ease the pain.\u201d</p><p>I blushed. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>After a lot of walking, we arrived to the Headquarters. Draco was following behind. We went upstairs, and Ron left to his room and I showed Draco were he could sleep. I knew there was a lot to be said, but we all needed to sleep first.</p><p>Once he sat down onto the bed, I spoke up. \u201cYou\u2019ve been really quiet, are you okay? Do you need anything?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head so I nodded and made my way to the door, but before I could open it, Draco was already in front of me not letting me pass. \u201cCan you stay\u2026 with me?\u201d he asked it looking down at the floor. Somehow I managed to smile.</p><p>\u201cYes, sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course if Ron doesn\u2019t mind\u2026\u201d</p><p>I giggled. \u201cWhy would he?\u201d</p><p>Draco frowned his eyebrows as I lied on the bed. \u201cAren\u2019t you two\u2026 together?\u201d I shook my head giggling again. He dropped the subject once he got the answer he wanted. \u201cWhat made you not lose it?\u201d</p><p>Of course he would have seen me blushing back when Ron had asked this and he had been curious. He lied down beside me, \u201cI don\u2019t know, I really was trying to think of you and everything we used to do when we were together\u201d he smiled even though he knew he shouldn\u2019t have. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot to be said, but it can wait until tomorrow. Just sleep\u201d I said to him, he was already closing his eyes, he just wrapped his arms around my body.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t leave\u201d was all that he said. \u201cDon\u2019t leave <i>me</i>.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t, I\u2019ll be here when you wake up. I promise.\u201d</p><p>He kissed my temple with his eyes closed, and I let myself be wrapped up in his arms. I loved that feeling. I knew there was a lot to be said, but I wanted to be between his arms once more for a little while.</p><p><b><a href=\"http://suburbiasqueen.tumblr.com/post/177533657216/pain-2-draco-malfoy\">Part 2</a></b></p></p>",

Ron&rsquo;s hand caressed mine sweetly, trying to say something but then a really blond almost white-haired man appeared. Lucius Malfoy. Draco&rsquo;s dad, meaning he was then my ex father in law.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not really nice to enter without being invited in private properties&rdquo; the woman said then, she was obviously mocking us.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m sorry. It was YOUR MEN who took us here. You then might consider having them, not like we would have wanted to be here in the first place&rdquo; I spat at her, Lucius shook his head in disbelief.</p><p>He wasn&rsquo;t looking very well as he used to. He looked&hellip; poorer. Like, he had lost everything and as if somehow he couldn&rsquo;t manage to sleep well at night. I couldn&rsquo;t believe for the first time in years I was feeling sorry for that horrible man, who had put constantly up in trouble my friends and his son. </p><p>&ldquo;Y/N, I would suggest you to shut up for once&rdquo; it&rsquo;s all that he said. Was he advising me? Or was he trying to mock me as well? The first year Draco and I started to have a thing, Lucius used to hate me but as the time flew by, he kind of started to be sweeter. I knew he had ended up liking me as his son&rsquo;s girlfriend, that was why I wasn&rsquo;t getting his message.</p><p>The woman looked at us. &ldquo;I honestly don&rsquo;t like you&rdquo; she said before started screaming and laughing loudly. I swear I had seen her somewhere, I just couldn&rsquo;t recall where. Her laughing became really strong to my ears, and it started to be hopelessly annoying. I looked up at Ron, we were both honestly scared. Knowingly that the Malfoy&rsquo;s were Death Eaters and this woman seemed as she was crazy&hellip;</p><p>She was crazy.</p><p>She had been in Azkaban, for sure.</p><p>She had to be Bellatrix Lestrange.</p><p>Something clicked inside me. I had then a reason to be scared. She had killed his own cousin, I was pretty much sure she&rsquo;d kill us without even blinking. Bellatrix was known as the most loyal server to Voldemort. </p><p>And I knew that somehow she knew what I was thinking and she took advantage of it. &ldquo;So you know now who I am&hellip; Are you scared, princess?&rdquo; She came across the room to face me, and her wand caressed my cheekbone. She was being gentle, but I knew I had to be scared. I couldn&rsquo;t get my wand at that moment and Ron couldn&rsquo;t either. His hand left mine. &ldquo;Such a shame Draco dated you&hellip; And that you&rsquo;re dating a Weasley now.&rdquo;</p><p>There were loads of things I would like to have said to her. But I tried to keep my mouth shut. It was very short after her last sentence where she spoke up what could have been the end of me. She looked at me, took a few steps aside, and waved her wand again in the air&hellip; this time saying &lsquo;<i>crucio&rsquo;</i>. </p><p>I kneeled down instantly, feeling the worst pain I could ever have felt. Not even recalling have felt something so painful when I fell down of my groom at a Quidditch game or even after having fallen down a mountain when climbing it. That was definitely something else. It felt like a million sharp knives pointing at me and slowly entering in my skin and my body.</p><p>I didn&rsquo;t even realize I was screaming my lungs out. The pain I was feeling was so intense, I tried to open my eyes to look for Ron and tried to say that I was fine, just for him to calm down at least but I couldn&rsquo;t. And I tried to think of Draco, I tried to think of our first kiss hidden in the Astronomy Tower back in Hogwarts, out first date that was a trip to &nbsp;Hogsmade that ended up being a complete disaster but really funny, the first time he had told me his real feelings towards me, when he had asked me to be his girlfriend and the first time we made love. Even I tried to think of all those times we would sneak around and get into each other&rsquo;s common rooms or even dormitories . </p><p>The air was hot, and I felt like I was going to burst or even worse, that I&rsquo;d be burned as a witch. And I would have rather that she had just burned me alive instead of feeling that pain. I tried to open my eyes, to fight the curse. I couldn&rsquo;t. Inside of my head, back then, after all my feelings, all the pain and hurt I was being reminded of Neville&rsquo;s parents. If she kept doing that, I&rsquo;d end up as insane as them. What I was feeling was beyond any pain I could have ever felt, and somehow I found myself looking up and seeing Ron with tears in his eyes.</p><p>My throat was sore, probably from all the screaming I would have been on. And everything went black, and somehow the curse had stopped. Someone was running towards me, I tried to move but I couldn&rsquo;t. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, princess. Are you alright? I know you&rsquo;re not. Merlin, We only have two minutes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Draco?&rdquo; was all that I could say. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see a thing&rdquo; I mumbled.</p><p>&ldquo;I know, when the light comes out again, the time will be on as well. We need to make it out of here. Ron&rsquo;s waiting for us. Come on, princess, I know you can do this. You can move&rdquo; and hearing that he had cared even for saving Ron made my heart flutter in so many ways. I tried to move but it was really difficult, the struggle was being very visible. He came to me and he lift me up with his arms to make our way out but when we reached the door, the light came on again. </p><p>And I fell onto the ground after Draco. He was screaming, he had been hit with the Cruciatus Curse. And it wasn&rsquo;t going to happen right in front of my eyes, I would never watch him go as crazy as he was going. I tried not to cry, as I lift my wand and pointed at Bellatrix before cursing her &ldquo;<i>Imperio</i>&rdquo;. She instantly left Draco alone, he stopped screaming and somehow he could get up. I didn&rsquo;t even know where I had got my strength from, but I just did. I felt as if I had been born again. &ldquo;You are going to let me leave with Ron&rdquo; I said harshly at her. &ldquo;And you&rsquo;ll leave us alone for a while, you will not order anyone to follow us&rdquo; I said, and as I was talking Lucius Malfoy had his wand pointing at me, he was about to cast a spell.</p><p>&ldquo;Expelliarmus! Don&rsquo;t you ever dare to touch her, dad&rdquo; and Lucius&rsquo; wand flied to the other side of the big room. I hadn&rsquo;t even recognized that we were at the Malfoy&rsquo;s manor.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not leaving!&rdquo; that&rsquo;s all that Lucius said, he wasn&rsquo;t talking to me. He was talking to Draco, he looked at me then. </p><p>&ldquo;Yes, I am.&rdquo;</p><p>I lowered my wand, and we left almost running, we had been now walking for while. We were fairly away from his manor. Ron had his hands tugged inside his pockets and he let one out to run it through his hair. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know you&rsquo;d have the balls&rdquo; he admitted. Draco smiled at Ron&rsquo;s words. Could that possibly be happening? Well, it was.</p><p>&ldquo;You need to rest, princess&rdquo; Draco said then. </p><p>Ron was walking ahead of us, Draco instead was beside me. Ron turned around to look at me, and I don&rsquo;t know what he thought in that exact moment but the words he said then made my heart flutter once more. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go to the Headquarters&rdquo;. Knowing how much he had hated Draco, or how much he still hated him, the fact that he was inviting him said a lot. He saw me smile, and added &ldquo;that doesn&rsquo;t mean I trust you, but after you saved my life&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She did&rdquo; Draco snapped at Ron. I giggled then because I knew him well enough to know that he didn&rsquo;t mean to be mean at that exact moment, he just didn&rsquo;t want to talk. </p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say that, you wouldn&rsquo;t have been able to have left Ron behind even if you deeply have wanted to. And I&rsquo;d be dead if it wasn&rsquo;t for you&rdquo; he looked at me, he was puzzled.</p><p>&ldquo;My dad wouldn&rsquo;t&hellip;&rdquo; but he knew deep inside that I was right, that his father would have killed me and I didn&rsquo;t want to push it because it wasn&rsquo;t his fault. </p><p>I changed the subject. &ldquo;Are you sure you want to be with us?&rdquo;</p><p>He just nodded.</p><p>&ldquo;You have a lot of explaining to do, Malfoy&rdquo; Ron spoke up. </p><p>&ldquo;Not now, Ron&rdquo; I mumbled, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s just been casted the cruciatus curse, let him rest.&rdquo;</p><p>Ron&rsquo;s face flinched. &ldquo;For like what?!
