I can't concentrate on reading textbooks or doing excercises because all the time I feel very very sleepy and even coffee/yerba mate/energy drinks didn't help me (i tried all of them during this week and I still felt sleepy all the time).

Recently my mother was diagnosed with diabetes and I had my own \u201cpre-diabetic\u201d scare. I was also diagnosed with PCOS and some mental illness. I\u2019ve been eating the recommended diabetic carb intake since 9/12/18. I have also been a vegetarian for seven years now and I\u2019m allergic to gluten. I have a long way to go and wanted to keep a blog of my journey! Even if I\u2019m the only one reading this I want to be able to look back on my progress. However, I hope you come along for the ride and get something out of this! :)</p>",

That\u2019s really the first and biggest step. The only other thing I would say is to listen to your body. Learn when it is actually hungry, learn when you are full. This was insanely hard for me. 22 years of making myself full until I was sick doesn\u2019t just go away. Counting calories left me starving all the time. Counting net carbs (total carbs - dietary fiber) is the only way I was able to actually notice what my body was trying to tell me all along. </p><p>Another thing I would say is don\u2019t go crazy. You\u2019re young. Have fun. Eat \u201cbad\u201d meals sometimes. Don\u2019t beat yourself up. Just try your hardest but don\u2019t forget to live. </p><p>Lastly, I just started with super easy exercise. Just walking 30 minutes a day got my body used to moving again. Doing small things and working my body up to fitness is one of the best decisions I made. Don\u2019t overdo it but try to do something 3-5 days a week. Try but don\u2019t hurt yourself. </p><p>Overall, take it slow. Love yourself every day and do what feels right. You can do this &lt;3</p>",

That\u2019s really the first and biggest step. The only other thing I would say is to listen to your body. Learn when it is actually hungry, learn when you are full. This was insanely hard for me. 22 years of making myself full until I was sick doesn\u2019t just go away. Counting calories left me starving all the time. Counting net carbs (total carbs - dietary fiber) is the only way I was able to actually notice what my body was trying to tell me all along. </p><p>Another thing I would say is don\u2019t go crazy. You\u2019re young. Have fun. Eat \u201cbad\u201d meals sometimes. Don\u2019t beat yourself up. Just try your hardest but don\u2019t forget to live. </p><p>Lastly, I just started with super easy exercise. Just walking 30 minutes a day got my body used to moving again. Doing small things and working my body up to fitness is one of the best decisions I made. Don\u2019t overdo it but try to do something 3-5 days a week. Try but don\u2019t hurt yourself. </p><p>Overall, take it slow. Love yourself every day and do what feels right. You can do this &lt;3</p>",

        "body": "<p>Fitness is important, whether your goal is to compete in a triathlon or to just shed a few pounds. Since a lot of people don&rsquo;t know where to start, we&rsquo;ve done the work for you and compiled a list of tips and tricks to get you on your way.<br/><br/>Are you strapped for time when it comes to working out? Make your workouts into two sessions. Do not increase the time you workout, but try to break it into a half. As an example, instead of jogging for an entire hour, jog for a half-hour in the early morning and then for another half-hour later on in the day. If you cringe at the thought of visiting the gym two times daily, do it only once and get your other exercise outdoors.<br/><br/>Simple push-ups can do wonders to tone your triceps. A great method to get your triceps toned up in a different way is to turn your hand in 45 degree angles, making sure your fingertips face each other. When you do pushups this way, you&rsquo;ll have the triceps targeted and strengthened more effectively.<br/><br/>Stay motivated about fitness by using a variety of fitness classes. By opting for different classes you may discover a class that you love. Try out yoga or dancing. You could also do a boxing or yoga class. The great thing about trying different classes is that you need not return to any you don&rsquo;t like, and you&rsquo;ll still be working out productively throughout the trial process.<br/><br/>The importance of a strong, solid core can not be overstated. Having a stable, strong core helps with balance and any other exercise you do. Sit-ups are one exercise that will help your core to become stronger. This will help you improve your ab muscles. Improve your core and you improve the rest of your body as well.<br/><br/>Before you begin a bench workout, you should check the padding thickness by firmly pressing your fingers down into the cushion. If the wood can be felt directly under the top pads, you should consider using another machine. A machine that does not have adequate padding can cause bruising during your workout.<br/><br/>When you are weight lifting, squeeze your buttocks each time you lift the weights up. This will help firm up your butt while helping your body to align itself better for a safer work out. This will also help to stabilize your spine as you lift the weights.<br/><br/>You can increase the rate your strength grows by doing your exercise routine in 10 percent less time. This routine will work your muscles harder and will increase your endurance. During your next strenuous workout, shave 3 minutes off of your 30 minute time allotment.<br/><br/>The benefits of fitness are not only physical. Doing regular exercise has been shown to improve mental health, as well. Working out releases endorphins creating a sense of euphoria. You will look better and feel better. This helps to build self-esteem and confidence. You can think of working out as a way to being happy.<br/><br/>By reading the tips in this article you will be more prepared to start achieving your fitness goals. If you stay motivated, you will succeed. You will be glad that you put in all the time and effort that you did as you age.</p><p><br/></p><p>For more information, visit us over at <a href=\"http://1800healthfitness.com\">1800healthfitness.com</a>.</p><p>Or check out our work over on our <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCto0J1alMASkwT8WAt2froA\">YouTube Channel</a><br/></p><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCto0J1alMASkwT8WAt2froA\">fitness videos</a></p>",
