Two people who aren\u2019t particularly close to anyone still alive, so they\u2019re not really fighting for their loved ones\u2019 futures. They also don\u2019t believe there\u2019s any kind of afterlife, so they\u2019re not looking to have their souls redeemed or get rewarded. Their actions are purely for the good of humanity. \u00a0 <br/></li><li>Theon, who didn\u2019t believe he could ever make amends for his mistakes and even told Sansa once that he didn\u2019t want to be forgiven, didn\u2019t come to Winterfell for redemption. He is not motivated by revenge either because the Night King hasn\u2019t done anything to him. He\u2019s there because he loves Sansa and Bran. Even though you can tell that every nerve in his body is screaming for him to bolt when the Walkers arrive and you can practically hear Ramsay whispering \u201cReeeek!\u201d in his ear, he stands his ground. Because Bran needs him and Theon is going to do anything to protect him.<br/></li><li>Edd, who once ran from the Walkers and left Sam behind, saves Sam\u2019s life this time. Now Gilly, who has suffered so much, still has her husband (shut up, they <i>are</i> married) and the father of her children. <br/></li><li>Lyanna Mormont, though but a child, is the leader of her people and she felt it was her duty to stand with them.</li><li>Jorah literally does not allow himself to fall while Dany is still in danger. He only succumbs to his wounds once he sees that the threat is eliminated. <br/></li><li>And of course, Arya. Arya, who didn\u2019t even really like Beric much, fights tooth and nail to save him and when she can\u2019t, tries to ease his passing the best she can. And then when Mel gives her a bit of hope, Arya runs to save her baby brother and the rest of humanity, making sure Beric\u2019s sacrifice won\u2019t be in vain.\u00a0 \u00a0 </li></ul><p>If I were some kind of deity, that kind of selflessness, love, and loyalty would be the reason to decide that the human race <b>is</b> worth saving.</p><p>Sandor had a really hard time during the battle and struggled with PTSD and felt worthless. Even though he managed to keep fighting for Arya\u2019s sake and helped save her, I think he was very disappointed that he didn\u2019t do more or have some grand epiphany that explained why he survived for so long. <br/></p><figure data-orig-width=\"1366\" data-orig-height=\"768\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/3f249fb29d57b9566cc23083f80def82/tumblr_inline_prplntjjXn1r1tsct_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1366\" data-orig-height=\"768\"/></figure><p>He looks more broken than relieved when he realizes that it\u2019s over. At the victory party, he\u2019s still clearly depressed. He pushes Gendry and Tormund away. He snaps at the girl trying to proposition him. And he drinks. A lot.</p><p>Like Theon, there\u2019s a lot that keeps Sandor up at night. He is haunted by the things he\u2019s done and by the horrible things he has seen and experienced and so has never let himself get really close to anyone. The way he is and the life he\u2019s led are easily the result of growing up around someone like the Mountain. Violence and fear. His innocence shattered as a small child when his own brother shoved him face first into a fireplace and their father did nothing to stop Gregor, before or after. <br/></p><p>There\u2019s a lot of self loathing and guilt and regrets:<br/></p><figure data-orig-width=\"1366\" data-orig-height=\"768\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b301cd3e162b538bcd93b14ddd8745cf/tumblr_inline_prk259QCSt1r1tsct_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1366\" data-orig-height=\"768\"/></figure><figure data-orig-width=\"1366\" data-orig-height=\"768\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/dfadf017a330959700e492409a2bbe04/tumblr_inline_prpi49lvTu1r1tsct_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1366\" data-orig-height=\"768\"/></figure><figure data-orig-width=\"1366\" data-orig-height=\"768\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/6ceed6d43c0b75b5c33323ce80efde98/tumblr_inline_prpi4z62Di1r1tsct_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1366\" data-orig-height=\"768\"/></figure><figure data-orig-width=\"1366\" data-orig-height=\"768\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/3413b4d1654ebbdc478114171dff21bb/tumblr_inline_prpi5xqov41r1tsct_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1366\" data-orig-height=\"768\"/></figure><p>He\u2019s talking to Beric but there\u2019s definitely some projection up there.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1366\" data-orig-height=\"768\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/50e68b8e3452881cdedae1f66419335c/tumblr_inline_prphyiBEER1r1tsct_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1366\" data-orig-height=\"768\"/></figure><figure data-orig-width=\"1366\" data-orig-height=\"768\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/897fce722180c92a61c4cfbfea5de59c/tumblr_inline_prphzlJ6vv1r1tsct_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1366\" data-orig-height=\"768\"/></figure><p>From across the room, Sansa sees that Sandor is suffering and she reaches out to him. As they start catching up, Sandor has a lot of mixed emotions. He\u2019s proud of her and impressed but he\u2019s also devastated for her, too. If anyone understands the loss of innocence through cruelty, it\u2019s him. <br/></p><figure data-orig-width=\"1366\" data-orig-height=\"768\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/513181aae505d4a2f0f16ed53b6f5849/tumblr_inline_prpni9vwPx1r1tsct_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1366\" data-orig-height=\"768\"/></figure><p>In his way, he tells her that he wishes he could have spared her from it and that he really wanted to do so. Even though he often derided and pitied her childish innocence, it was also something that he cherished and envied. \u00a0 <br/></p><figure data-orig-width=\"1366\" data-orig-height=\"768\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b7ffc56dc7add1d2009f83c21612f245/tumblr_inline_prpodtWja51r1tsct_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1366\" data-orig-height=\"768\"/></figure><p>I know a lot of people criticized Sansa\u2019s line about how she\u2019d have stayed a little bird all of her life without Ramsay and Littlefinger and believe me, I understand and it\u2019s certainly possible that the writers are just insensitive jackasses. But within the context, I think it does make sense. When you don\u2019t have a real concept of mental health, never mind psychology or therapy, I imagine that rationalizing trauma would be a coping method.\u00a0 <br/></p><p>And unfortunately, this is also all Sansa has ever seen: you stay naive and sheltered or you randomly get shoved out of the nest and the only thing you can do is pray that you\u2019ll fly. <br/></p><p>However, we shouldn\u2019t forget that Sansa was not once a little bird solely because she was sweet and innocent. She was also very, very much in a cage:<br/></p><figure data-orig-width=\"1366\" data-orig-height=\"768\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/1db9233732bc8c08f432c42dfe99e325/tumblr_inline_prk10btOXG1r1tsct_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1366\" data-orig-height=\"768\"/></figure><p>Being able to use the connections she got from Littlefinger and Ramsay (the Vale, being close enough to reach Jon), she got to take back Winterfell and have a real home again. Then she got to make sure that those two got what they deserved. <br/></p><p>Sandor spent most of his life building a wall around himself but Sansa found a way to make herself free. She may have a better poker face and she may be more cautious, but she\u2019s still the same kind and caring person she&rsquo;s always been. She saw Sandor was hurting and tried to comfort him and didn\u2019t let him scare her off. She even puts her hand on his and I think that might even be the first time we\u2019ve seen anyone touch him out of affection. <br/></p><figure data-orig-width=\"1366\" data-orig-height=\"768\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/7e1d960387b079a2ffba683520a50989/tumblr_inline_prpp2eqAjm1r1tsct_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1366\" data-orig-height=\"768\"/></figure><p>When she leaves, he seems to be doing a lot of thinking and looks a lot less miserable. <br/></p><p>The next we see him, he\u2019s on his way to King\u2019s Landing and is joined by Arya. They seem to wordlessly agree that Sandor will hold off the Mountain while Arya kills Cersei. Neither expect to survive but it will end the war and it will save lives so they\u2019re willing to make the trade. <br/></p><figure data-orig-width=\"1366\" data-orig-height=\"768\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/f3a2578dbb5bc5105115685708d3ea84/tumblr_inline_prpqk9PE6P1r1tsct_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1366\" data-orig-height=\"768\"/></figure><p>However, before they can reach Cersei and Gregor, it rapidly becomes apparent that it\u2019s too late and that virtually everyone in King\u2019s Landing is doomed. <br/></p><p>Sandor points this out to Arya. But her chances of leaving safely probably don\u2019t look all that good to her anyway and she\u2019s <i>so </i>close to the last person alive she hates most. The person who is, in a lot of ways, the catalyst for all of her suffering. It\u2019s natural that she\u2019d want to take Cersei down with her. <br/></p><p>It has some interesting parallels to her reunion with Melisandre. Beric, Sandor, and Mel were all once on her list but she forgave them and phased them out. Sandor and Beric ended up saving her life. But I think it\u2019s likely she put Melisandre back on her list when she found out what happened to Gendry. She looked pretty pissed:<br/></p><figure data-orig-width=\"1366\" data-orig-height=\"768\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e4bac0b90090068cebbbf824cc574121/tumblr_inline_prpiyuUoCV1r1tsct_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1366\" data-orig-height=\"768\"/></figure><p>Even though it looks like she\u2019s only a few moments from death, I could see her thinking \u201cAt least I can avenge Gendry before I die.\u201d But Melisandre tells her she might be able to<i> end</i> this and it\u2019s not even a question. Arya leaves her to focus on saving the people she\u2019s cares about.<br/><br/>But it\u2019s different in King\u2019s Landing. She\u2019s not home. None of her family is nearby except for Jon and he\u2019s probably okay. Her friends and family aren\u2019t <i>counting</i> on her, at least not in the same way. <br/></p><p>Cersei is going to die, it\u2019s just a question of how. So Arya has to decide what really matters: Revenge or Justice? If Arya has to be the one to kill Cersei, then it\u2019s just about revenge. If it\u2019s just about stopping someone cruel in power, then Arya can go.</p><p>Now Sandor\u2019s speech about how he\u2019s only wanted revenge feels a little clunky (I personally believe that bit is pulled from Lady Stoneheart) but I think it\u2019s easy enough to see it as Sandor not knowing how to explain all his feelings of guilt and purposelessness and loneliness that stem from Gregor to Arya, even if he had enough time.<br/></p><p>It\u2019s certainly clear from the way he gently cradles Arya\u2019s head like a parent does for a baby, that revenge is not all he cared about. I also think he\u2019s kind of mimicking how Sansa took his hand to comfort him and add sincerity, hoping to do the same for Arya. <br/></p><figure data-orig-width=\"1366\" data-orig-height=\"768\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/8a8d62e309c9a0e11be61c704af23fc7/tumblr_inline_prpquh61sf1r1tsct_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1366\" data-orig-height=\"768\"/></figure><p>Arya decides that revenge isn\u2019t worth dying for and she\u2019d rather have the chance to live. And considering how Cersei faced death with such a raw and pitiable fear and bone deep anguish, I think it\u2019s more than fair to say that killing her wouldn\u2019t have brought Arya any satisfaction anyway. Arya calls to him by name for the first time and she thanks him. <br/></p><p>What I liked best about this scene though is how the Hound, on Cersei\u2019s and Joffrey\u2019s orders, brought the first bit of darkness to Arya\u2019s world by killing Mycah. But with this scene, Sandor gives Arya a bit of light that (hopefully) will never go out. Kinda like giving back the last piece of Arya Stark that started splintering once she left Winterfell. <br/></p><p>So why does Sandor still go after his brother?</p><p>Because he\u2019s had a very difficult and sad life and he\u2019s done a lot of things he wishes he could take back. And then on top of all of that, despite all odds, he manages to be brought back from the brink of death. <b>And it must be for a reason, right? What makes him better than Mycah or Ned or the farmer and his daughter?<br/></b></p><p> Now maybe it was some kind of divine intervention that gave him the idea, but I think it\u2019s more likely Sandor just straight up decides that his purpose was to free the world once and for all from the Mountain. Unlike Cersei, who is a small and fragile mortal, the Mountain definitely is not. How many (more) soldiers would have to die trying to get to him before the dragon could? <i>If</i> it even could.\u00a0 <br/></p><p>I saw a lot of people decrying the eye squish as pure gore or shock value but not at all! It was a call back to the Mountain\u2019s fight with Oberyn. <b>Oberyn, who could have killed the Mountain years ago if he hadn\u2019t wanted revenge more than he wanted to stop the Mountain from brutalizing, torturing, or killing anyone else ever again</b>. <br/></p><p>But stopping him <b>is </b>what Sandor wanted most, so much that he could even overcome his worst fears. Sandor had a lifetime of the Mountain maiming and murdering countless people: Ripping dozens of daughters, mothers, fathers, sisters, sons, and brothers from their families; widowing who knows how many husbands and wives; and no one had been able to properly do anything about it for years and years. It\u2019s why he stepped between the Mountain and Loras all those years ago. Only this time, Sandor has the strength and ability to stop him for good.<br/></p><p>That\u2019s why he succeeds where Oberyn failed.</p><p>Near the beginning, it seemed like the Hound was introduced as a method of instigating Innocence Lost. But throughout the series, we see him become a champion for the innocent, such as Sansa and Arya and even Loras. In the end, Sandor takes out one of the most vicious and murderous characters (which is saying something) who is practically synonymous with the loss of innocence through brutality.</p><p>Yeah, he did it for himself but he also did it for his sister and father and their missing servants, for Elia and her babies, the prisoners at Harrenhal, and so many others. He did it for everyone who could have come in contact with Gregor in the future. The knowledge that the Mountain would never harm anyone again is probably what gave Sandor real peace.<br/></p><p>He just saw it as a bonus that Gregor got what he deserved and that Sandor&ndash;<i>not the Hound-</i>- got to give it to him.<br/></p>",

Two people who aren\u2019t particularly close to anyone still alive, so they\u2019re not really fighting for their loved ones\u2019 futures. They also don\u2019t believe there\u2019s any kind of afterlife, so they\u2019re not looking to have their souls redeemed or get rewarded. Their actions are purely for the good of humanity. \u00a0 <br></li><li>Theon, who didn\u2019t believe he could ever make amends for his mistakes and even told Sansa once that he didn\u2019t want to be forgiven, didn\u2019t come to Winterfell for redemption. He is not motivated by revenge either because the Night King hasn\u2019t done anything to him. He\u2019s there because he loves Sansa and Bran. Even though you can tell that every nerve in his body is screaming for him to bolt when the Walkers arrive and you can practically hear Ramsay whispering \u201cReeeek!\u201d in his ear, he stands his ground. Because Bran needs him and Theon is going to do anything to protect him.<br></li><li>Edd, who once ran from the Walkers and left Sam behind, saves Sam\u2019s life this time. Now Gilly, who has suffered so much, still has her husband (shut up, they <i>are</i> married) and the father of her children. <br></li><li>Lyanna Mormont, though but a child, is the leader of her people and she felt it was her duty to stand with them.</li><li>Jorah literally does not allow himself to fall while Dany is still in danger. He only succumbs to his wounds once he sees that the threat is eliminated. <br></li><li>And of course, Arya. Arya, who didn\u2019t even really like Beric much, fights tooth and nail to save him and when she can\u2019t, tries to ease his passing the best she can. And then when Mel gives her a bit of hope, Arya runs to save her baby brother and the rest of humanity, making sure Beric\u2019s sacrifice won\u2019t be in vain.\u00a0 \u00a0 </li></ul><p>If I were some kind of deity, that kind of selflessness, love, and loyalty would be the reason to decide that the human race <b>is</b> worth saving.</p><p>Sandor had a really hard time during the battle and struggled with PTSD and felt worthless. Even though he managed to keep fighting for Arya\u2019s sake and helped save her, I think he was very disappointed that he didn\u2019t do more or have some grand epiphany that explained why he survived for so long. <br></p><figure data-orig-width=\"1366\" data-orig-height=\"768\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/3f249fb29d57b9566cc23083f80def82/tumblr_inline_prplntjjXn1r1tsct_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1366\" data-orig-height=\"768\"></figure><p>He looks more broken than relieved when he realizes that it\u2019s over. At the victory party, he\u2019s still clearly depressed. He pushes Gendry and Tormund away. He snaps at the girl trying to proposition him. And he drinks. A lot.</p><p>Like Theon, there\u2019s a lot that keeps Sandor up at night. He is haunted by the things he\u2019s done and by the horrible things he has seen and experienced and so has never let himself get really close to anyone. The way he is and the life he\u2019s led are easily the result of growing up around someone like the Mountain. Violence and fear. His innocence shattered as a small child when his own brother shoved him face first into a fireplace and their father did nothing to stop Gregor, before or after. <br></p><p>There\u2019s a lot of self loathing and guilt and regrets:<br></p><figure data-orig-width=\"1366\" data-orig-height=\"768\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b301cd3e162b538bcd93b14ddd8745cf/tumblr_inline_prk259QCSt1r1tsct_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1366\" data-orig-height=\"768\"></figure><figure data-orig-width=\"1366\" data-orig-height=\"768\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/dfadf017a330959700e492409a2bbe04/tumblr_inline_prpi49lvTu1r1tsct_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1366\" data-orig-height=\"768\"></figure><figure data-orig-width=\"1366\" data-orig-height=\"768\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/6ceed6d43c0b75b5c33323ce80efde98/tumblr_inline_prpi4z62Di1r1tsct_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1366\" data-orig-height=\"768\"></figure><figure data-orig-width=\"1366\" data-orig-height=\"768\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/3413b4d1654ebbdc478114171dff21bb/tumblr_inline_prpi5xqov41r1tsct_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1366\" data-orig-height=\"768\"></figure><p>He\u2019s talking to Beric but there\u2019s definitely some projection up there.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1366\" data-orig-height=\"768\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/50e68b8e3452881cdedae1f66419335c/tumblr_inline_prphyiBEER1r1tsct_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1366\" data-orig-height=\"768\"></figure><figure data-orig-width=\"1366\" data-orig-height=\"768\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/897fce722180c92a61c4cfbfea5de59c/tumblr_inline_prphzlJ6vv1r1tsct_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1366\" data-orig-height=\"768\"></figure><p>From across the room, Sansa sees that Sandor is suffering and she reaches out to him. As they start catching up, Sandor has a lot of mixed emotions. He\u2019s proud of her and impressed but he\u2019s also devastated for her, too. If anyone understands the loss of innocence through cruelty, it\u2019s him. <br></p><figure data-orig-width=\"1366\" data-orig-height=\"768\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/513181aae505d4a2f0f16ed53b6f5849/tumblr_inline_prpni9vwPx1r1tsct_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1366\" data-orig-height=\"768\"></figure><p>In his way, he tells her that he wishes he could have spared her from it and that he really wanted to do so. Even though he often derided and pitied her childish innocence, it was also something that he cherished and envied. \u00a0 <br></p><figure data-orig-width=\"1366\" data-orig-height=\"768\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b7ffc56dc7add1d2009f83c21612f245/tumblr_inline_prpodtWja51r1tsct_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1366\" data-orig-height=\"768\"></figure><p>I know a lot of people criticized Sansa\u2019s line about how she\u2019d have stayed a little bird all of her life without Ramsay and Littlefinger and believe me, I understand and it\u2019s certainly possible that the writers are just insensitive jackasses. But within the context, I think it does make sense. When you don\u2019t have a real concept of mental health, never mind psychology or therapy, I imagine that rationalizing trauma would be a coping method.\u00a0 <br></p><p>And unfortunately, this is also all Sansa has ever seen: you stay naive and sheltered or you randomly get shoved out of the nest and the only thing you can do is pray that you\u2019ll fly. <br></p><p>However, we shouldn\u2019t forget that Sansa was not once a little bird solely because she was sweet and innocent. She was also very, very much in a cage:<br></p><figure data-orig-width=\"1366\" data-orig-height=\"768\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/1db9233732bc8c08f432c42dfe99e325/tumblr_inline_prk10btOXG1r1tsct_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1366\" data-orig-height=\"768\"></figure><p>Being able to use the connections she got from Littlefinger and Ramsay (the Vale, being close enough to reach Jon), she got to take back Winterfell and have a real home again. Then she got to make sure that those two got what they deserved. <br></p><p>Sandor spent most of his life building a wall around himself but Sansa found a way to make herself free. She may have a better poker face and she may be more cautious, but she\u2019s still the same kind and caring person she\u2019s always been. She saw Sandor was hurting and tried to comfort him and didn\u2019t let him scare her off. She even puts her hand on his and I think that might even be the first time we\u2019ve seen anyone touch him out of affection. <br></p><figure data-orig-width=\"1366\" data-orig-height=\"768\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/7e1d960387b079a2ffba683520a50989/tumblr_inline_prpp2eqAjm1r1tsct_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1366\" data-orig-height=\"768\"></figure><p>When she leaves, he seems to be doing a lot of thinking and looks a lot less miserable. <br></p><p>The next we see him, he\u2019s on his way to King\u2019s Landing and is joined by Arya. They seem to wordlessly agree that Sandor will hold off the Mountain while Arya kills Cersei. Neither expect to survive but it will end the war and it will save lives so they\u2019re willing to make the trade. <br></p><figure data-orig-width=\"1366\" data-orig-height=\"768\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/f3a2578dbb5bc5105115685708d3ea84/tumblr_inline_prpqk9PE6P1r1tsct_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1366\" data-orig-height=\"768\"></figure><p>However, before they can reach Cersei and Gregor, it rapidly becomes apparent that it\u2019s too late and that virtually everyone in King\u2019s Landing is doomed. <br></p><p>Sandor points this out to Arya. But her chances of leaving safely probably don\u2019t look all that good to her anyway and she\u2019s <i>so </i>close to the last person alive she hates most. The person who is, in a lot of ways, the catalyst for all of her suffering. It\u2019s natural that she\u2019d want to take Cersei down with her. <br></p><p>It has some interesting parallels to her reunion with Melisandre. Beric, Sandor, and Mel were all once on her list but she forgave them and phased them out. Sandor and Beric ended up saving her life. But I think it\u2019s likely she put Melisandre back on her list when she found out what happened to Gendry. She looked pretty pissed:<br></p><figure data-orig-width=\"1366\" data-orig-height=\"768\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e4bac0b90090068cebbbf824cc574121/tumblr_inline_prpiyuUoCV1r1tsct_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1366\" data-orig-height=\"768\"></figure><p>Even though it looks like she\u2019s only a few moments from death, I could see her thinking \u201cAt least I can avenge Gendry before I die.\u201d But Melisandre tells her she might be able to<i> end</i> this and it\u2019s not even a question. Arya leaves her to focus on saving the people she\u2019s cares about.<br><br>But it\u2019s different in King\u2019s Landing. She\u2019s not home. None of her family is nearby except for Jon and he\u2019s probably okay. Her friends and family aren\u2019t <i>counting</i> on her, at least not in the same way. <br></p><p>Cersei is going to die, it\u2019s just a question of how. So Arya has to decide what really matters: Revenge or Justice? If Arya has to be the one to kill Cersei, then it\u2019s just about revenge. If it\u2019s just about stopping someone cruel in power, then Arya can go.</p><p>Now Sandor\u2019s speech about how he\u2019s only wanted revenge feels a little clunky (I personally believe that bit is pulled from Lady Stoneheart) but I think it\u2019s easy enough to see it as Sandor not knowing how to explain all his feelings of guilt and purposelessness and loneliness that stem from Gregor to Arya, even if he had enough time.<br></p><p>It\u2019s certainly clear from the way he gently cradles Arya\u2019s head like a parent does for a baby, that revenge is not all he cared about. I also think he\u2019s kind of mimicking how Sansa took his hand to comfort him and add sincerity, hoping to do the same for Arya. <br></p><figure data-orig-width=\"1366\" data-orig-height=\"768\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/8a8d62e309c9a0e11be61c704af23fc7/tumblr_inline_prpquh61sf1r1tsct_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1366\" data-orig-height=\"768\"></figure><p>Arya decides that revenge isn\u2019t worth dying for and she\u2019d rather have the chance to live. And considering how Cersei faced death with such a raw and pitiable fear and bone deep anguish, I think it\u2019s more than fair to say that killing her wouldn\u2019t have brought Arya any satisfaction anyway. Arya calls to him by name for the first time and she thanks him. <br></p><p>What I liked best about this scene though is how the Hound, on Cersei\u2019s and Joffrey\u2019s orders, brought the first bit of darkness to Arya\u2019s world by killing Mycah. But with this scene, Sandor gives Arya a bit of light that (hopefully) will never go out. Kinda like giving back the last piece of Arya Stark that started splintering once she left Winterfell. <br></p><p>So why does Sandor still go after his brother?</p><p>Because he\u2019s had a very difficult and sad life and he\u2019s done a lot of things he wishes he could take back. And then on top of all of that, despite all odds, he manages to be brought back from the brink of death. <b>And it must be for a reason, right? What makes him better than Mycah or Ned or the farmer and his daughter?<br></b></p><p> Now maybe it was some kind of divine intervention that gave him the idea, but I think it\u2019s more likely Sandor just straight up decides that his purpose was to free the world once and for all from the Mountain. Unlike Cersei, who is a small and fragile mortal, the Mountain definitely is not. How many (more) soldiers would have to die trying to get to him before the dragon could? <i>If</i> it even could.\u00a0 <br></p><p>I saw a lot of people decrying the eye squish as pure gore or shock value but not at all! It was a call back to the Mountain\u2019s fight with Oberyn. <b>Oberyn, who could have killed the Mountain years ago if he hadn\u2019t wanted revenge more than he wanted to stop the Mountain from brutalizing, torturing, or killing anyone else ever again</b>. <br></p><p>But stopping him <b>is </b>what Sandor wanted most, so much that he could even overcome his worst fears. Sandor had a lifetime of the Mountain maiming and murdering countless people: Ripping dozens of daughters, mothers, fathers, sisters, sons, and brothers from their families; widowing who knows how many husbands and wives; and no one had been able to properly do anything about it for years and years. It\u2019s why he stepped between the Mountain and Loras all those years ago. Only this time, Sandor has the strength and ability to stop him for good.<br></p><p>That\u2019s why he succeeds where Oberyn failed.</p><p>Near the beginning, it seemed like the Hound was introduced as a method of instigating Innocence Lost. But throughout the series, we see him become a champion for the innocent, such as Sansa and Arya and even Loras. In the end, Sandor takes out one of the most vicious and murderous characters (which is saying something) who is practically synonymous with the loss of innocence through brutality.</p><p>Yeah, he did it for himself but he also did it for his sister and father and their missing servants, for Elia and her babies, the prisoners at Harrenhal, and so many others. He did it for everyone who could have come in contact with Gregor in the future. The knowledge that the Mountain would never harm anyone again is probably what gave Sandor real peace.<br></p><p>He just saw it as a bonus that Gregor got what he deserved and that Sandor\u2013<i>not the Hound-</i>- got to give it to him.<br></p>",

They also don\u2019t believe there\u2019s any kind of afterlife, so they\u2019re not looking to have their souls redeemed or get rewarded. Their actions are purely for the good of humanity. \u00a0 <br></li><li>Theon, who didn\u2019t believe he could ever make amends for his mistakes and even told Sansa once that he didn\u2019t want to be forgiven, didn\u2019t come to Winterfell for redemption. He is not motivated by revenge either because the Night King hasn\u2019t done anything to him. He\u2019s there because he loves Sansa and Bran. Even though you can tell that every nerve in his body is screaming for him to bolt when the Walkers arrive and you can practically hear Ramsay whispering \u201cReeeek!\u201d in his ear, he stands his ground. Because Bran needs him and Theon is going to do anything to protect him.<br></li><li>Edd, who once ran from the Walkers and left Sam behind, saves Sam\u2019s life this time. Now Gilly, who has suffered so much, still has her husband (shut up, they <i>are</i> married) and the father of her children. <br></li><li>Lyanna Mormont, though but a child, is the leader of her people and she felt it was her duty to stand with them.</li><li>Jorah literally does not allow himself to fall while Dany is still in danger. He only succumbs to his wounds once he sees that the threat is eliminated. <br></li><li>And of course, Arya. Arya, who didn\u2019t even really like Beric much, fights tooth and nail to save him and when she can\u2019t, tries to ease his passing the best she can. And then when Mel gives her a bit of hope, Arya runs to save her baby brother and the rest of humanity, making sure Beric\u2019s sacrifice won\u2019t be in vain.\u00a0 \u00a0 </li></ul><p>If I were some kind of deity, that kind of selflessness, love, and loyalty would be the reason to decide that the human race <b>is</b> worth saving.</p><p>Sandor had a really hard time during the battle and struggled with PTSD and felt worthless.

She may have a better poker face and she may be more cautious, but she\u2019s still the same kind and caring person she\u2019s always been. She saw Sandor was hurting and tried to comfort him and didn\u2019t let him scare her off. She even puts her hand on his and I think that might even be the first time we\u2019ve seen anyone touch him out of affection. <br></p><figure data-orig-width=\"1366\" data-orig-height=\"768\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/7e1d960387b079a2ffba683520a50989/tumblr_inline_prpp2eqAjm1r1tsct_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1366\" data-orig-height=\"768\"></figure><p>When she leaves, he seems to be doing a lot of thinking and looks a lot less miserable. <br></p><p>The next we see him, he\u2019s on his way to King\u2019s Landing and is joined by Arya. They seem to wordlessly agree that Sandor will hold off the Mountain while Arya kills Cersei. Neither expect to survive but it will end the war and it will save lives so they\u2019re willing to make the trade. <br></p><figure data-orig-width=\"1366\" data-orig-height=\"768\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/f3a2578dbb5bc5105115685708d3ea84/tumblr_inline_prpqk9PE6P1r1tsct_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1366\" data-orig-height=\"768\"></figure><p>However, before they can reach Cersei and Gregor, it rapidly becomes apparent that it\u2019s too late and that virtually everyone in King\u2019s Landing is doomed. <br></p><p>Sandor points this out to Arya. But her chances of leaving safely probably don\u2019t look all that good to her anyway and she\u2019s <i>so </i>close to the last person alive she hates most. The person who is, in a lot of ways, the catalyst for all of her suffering. It\u2019s natural that she\u2019d want to take Cersei down with her. <br></p><p>It has some interesting parallels to her reunion with Melisandre. Beric, Sandor, and Mel were all once on her list but she forgave them and phased them out. Sandor and Beric ended up saving her life. But I think it\u2019s likely she put Melisandre back on her list when she found out what happened to Gendry. She looked pretty pissed:<br></p><figure data-orig-width=\"1366\" data-orig-height=\"768\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e4bac0b90090068cebbbf824cc574121/tumblr_inline_prpiyuUoCV1r1tsct_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1366\" data-orig-height=\"768\"></figure><p>Even though it looks like she\u2019s only a few moments from death, I could see her thinking \u201cAt least I can avenge Gendry before I die.\u201d But Melisandre tells her she might be able to<i> end</i> this and it\u2019s not even a question. Arya leaves her to focus on saving the people she\u2019s cares about.<br><br>But it\u2019s different in King\u2019s Landing. She\u2019s not home. None of her family is nearby except for Jon and he\u2019s probably okay. Her friends and family aren\u2019t <i>counting</i> on her, at least not in the same way. <br></p><p>Cersei is going to die, it\u2019s just a question of how. So Arya has to decide what really matters: Revenge or Justice? If Arya has to be the one to kill Cersei, then it\u2019s just about revenge. If it\u2019s just about stopping someone cruel in power, then Arya can go.</p><p>Now Sandor\u2019s speech about how he\u2019s only wanted revenge feels a little clunky (I personally believe that bit is pulled from Lady Stoneheart) but I think it\u2019s easy enough to see it as Sandor not knowing how to explain all his feelings of guilt and purposelessness and loneliness that stem from Gregor to Arya, even if he had enough time.<br></p><p>It\u2019s certainly clear from the way he gently cradles Arya\u2019s head like a parent does for a baby, that revenge is not all he cared about. I also think he\u2019s kind of mimicking how Sansa took his hand to comfort him and add sincerity, hoping to do the same for Arya. <br></p><figure data-orig-width=\"1366\" data-orig-height=\"768\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/8a8d62e309c9a0e11be61c704af23fc7/tumblr_inline_prpquh61sf1r1tsct_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1366\" data-orig-height=\"768\"></figure><p>Arya decides that revenge isn\u2019t worth dying for and she\u2019d rather have the chance to live. And considering how Cersei faced death with such a raw and pitiable fear and bone deep anguish, I think it\u2019s more than fair to say that killing her wouldn\u2019t have brought Arya any satisfaction anyway. Arya calls to him by name for the first time and she thanks him. <br></p><p>What I liked best about this scene though is how the Hound, on Cersei\u2019s and Joffrey\u2019s orders, brought the first bit of darkness to Arya\u2019s world by killing Mycah. But with this scene, Sandor gives Arya a bit of light that (hopefully) will never go out. Kinda like giving back the last piece of Arya Stark that started splintering once she left Winterfell. <br></p><p>So why does Sandor still go after his brother?</p><p>Because he\u2019s had a very difficult and sad life and he\u2019s done a lot of things he wishes he could take back. And then on top of all of that, despite all odds, he manages to be brought back from the brink of death. <b>And it must be for a reason, right? What makes him better than Mycah or Ned or the farmer and his daughter?<br></b></p><p> Now maybe it was some kind of divine intervention that gave him the idea, but I think it\u2019s more likely Sandor just straight up decides that his purpose was to free the world once and for all from the Mountain. Unlike Cersei, who is a small and fragile mortal, the Mountain definitely is not. How many (more) soldiers would have to die trying to get to him before the dragon could? <i>If</i> it even could.\u00a0 <br></p><p>I saw a lot of people decrying the eye squish as pure gore or shock value but not at all! It was a call back to the Mountain\u2019s fight with Oberyn. <b>Oberyn, who could have killed the Mountain years ago if he hadn\u2019t wanted revenge more than he wanted to stop the Mountain from brutalizing, torturing, or killing anyone else ever again</b>. <br></p><p>But stopping him <b>is </b>what Sandor wanted most, so much that he could even overcome his worst fears. Sandor had a lifetime of the Mountain maiming and murdering countless people: Ripping dozens of daughters, mothers, fathers, sisters, sons, and brothers from their families; widowing who knows how many husbands and wives; and no one had been able to properly do anything about it for years and years. It\u2019s why he stepped between the Mountain and Loras all those years ago. Only this time, Sandor has the strength and ability to stop him for good.<br></p><p>That\u2019s why he succeeds where Oberyn failed.</p><p>Near the beginning, it seemed like the Hound was introduced as a method of instigating Innocence Lost. But throughout the series, we see him become a champion for the innocent, such as Sansa and Arya and even Loras. In the end, Sandor takes out one of the most vicious and murderous characters (which is saying something) who is practically synonymous with the loss of innocence through brutality.</p><p>Yeah, he did it for himself but he also did it for his sister and father and their missing servants, for Elia and her babies, the prisoners at Harrenhal, and so many others. He did it for everyone who could have come in contact with Gregor in the future. The knowledge that the Mountain would never harm anyone again is probably what gave Sandor real peace.<br></p><p>He just saw it as a bonus that Gregor got what he deserved and that Sandor\u2013<i>not the Hound-</i>- got to give it to him.<br></p>",

Then she got to make sure that those two got what they deserved. <br /></p><p>Sandor spent most of his life building a wall around himself but Sansa found a way to make herself free. She may have a better poker face and she may be more cautious, but she&rsquo;s still the same kind and caring person she&rsquo;s always been. She saw Sandor was hurting and tried to comfort him and didn&rsquo;t let him scare her off. She even puts her hand on his and I think that might even be the first time we&rsquo;ve seen anyone touch him out of affection. <br /></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/7e1d960387b079a2ffba683520a50989/tumblr_inline_prpp2eqAjm1r1tsct_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>When she leaves, he seems to be doing a lot of thinking and looks a lot less miserable. <br /></p><p>The next we see him, he&rsquo;s on his way to King&rsquo;s Landing and is joined by Arya. They seem to wordlessly agree that Sandor will hold off the Mountain while Arya kills Cersei. Neither expect to survive but it will end the war and it will save lives so they&rsquo;re willing to make the trade. <br /></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/f3a2578dbb5bc5105115685708d3ea84/tumblr_inline_prpqk9PE6P1r1tsct_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>However, before they can reach Cersei and Gregor, it rapidly becomes apparent that it&rsquo;s too late and that virtually everyone in King&rsquo;s Landing is doomed. <br /></p><p>Sandor points this out to Arya. But her chances of leaving safely probably don&rsquo;t look all that good to her anyway and she&rsquo;s <i>so </i>close to the last person alive she hates most. The person who is, in a lot of ways, the catalyst for all of her suffering. It&rsquo;s natural that she&rsquo;d want to take Cersei down with her. <br /></p><p>It has some interesting parallels to her reunion with Melisandre. Beric, Sandor, and Mel were all once on her list but she forgave them and phased them out. Sandor and Beric ended up saving her life. But I think it&rsquo;s likely she put Melisandre back on her list when she found out what happened to Gendry. She looked pretty pissed:<br /></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e4bac0b90090068cebbbf824cc574121/tumblr_inline_prpiyuUoCV1r1tsct_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Even though it looks like she&rsquo;s only a few moments from death, I could see her thinking &ldquo;At least I can avenge Gendry before I die.&rdquo; But Melisandre tells her she might be able to<i> end</i> this and it&rsquo;s not even a question. Arya leaves her to focus on saving the people she&rsquo;s cares about.<br /><br />But it&rsquo;s different in King&rsquo;s Landing. She&rsquo;s not home. None of her family is nearby except for Jon and he&rsquo;s probably okay. Her friends and family aren&rsquo;t <i>counting</i> on her, at least not in the same way. <br /></p><p>Cersei is going to die, it&rsquo;s just a question of how. So Arya has to decide what really matters: Revenge or Justice? If Arya has to be the one to kill Cersei, then it&rsquo;s just about revenge. If it&rsquo;s just about stopping someone cruel in power, then Arya can go.</p><p>Now Sandor&rsquo;s speech about how he&rsquo;s only wanted revenge feels a little clunky (I personally believe that bit is pulled from Lady Stoneheart) but I think it&rsquo;s easy enough to see it as Sandor not knowing how to explain all his feelings of guilt and purposelessness and loneliness that stem from Gregor to Arya, even if he had enough time.<br /></p><p>It&rsquo;s certainly clear from the way he gently cradles Arya&rsquo;s head like a parent does for a baby, that revenge is not all he cared about. I also think he&rsquo;s kind of mimicking how Sansa took his hand to comfort him and add sincerity, hoping to do the same for Arya. <br /></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/8a8d62e309c9a0e11be61c704af23fc7/tumblr_inline_prpquh61sf1r1tsct_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Arya decides that revenge isn&rsquo;t worth dying for and she&rsquo;d rather have the chance to live. And considering how Cersei faced death with such a raw and pitiable fear and bone deep anguish, I think it&rsquo;s more than fair to say that killing her wouldn&rsquo;t have brought Arya any satisfaction anyway. Arya calls to him by name for the first time and she thanks him. <br /></p><p>What I liked best about this scene though is how the Hound, on Cersei&rsquo;s and Joffrey&rsquo;s orders, brought the first bit of darkness to Arya&rsquo;s world by killing Mycah. But with this scene, Sandor gives Arya a bit of light that (hopefully) will never go out. Kinda like giving back the last piece of Arya Stark that started splintering once she left Winterfell. <br /></p><p>So why does Sandor still go after his brother?</p><p>Because he&rsquo;s had a very difficult and sad life and he&rsquo;s done a lot of things he wishes he could take back. And then on top of all of that, despite all odds, he manages to be brought back from the brink of death. <b>And it must be for a reason, right? What makes him better than Mycah or Ned or the farmer and his daughter?<br /></b></p><p> Now maybe it was some kind of divine intervention that gave him the idea, but I think it&rsquo;s more likely Sandor just straight up decides that his purpose was to free the world once and for all from the Mountain. Unlike Cersei, who is a small and fragile mortal, the Mountain definitely is not. How many (more) soldiers would have to die trying to get to him before the dragon could? <i>If</i> it even could.&nbsp; <br /></p><p>I saw a lot of people decrying the eye squish as pure gore or shock value but not at all! It was a call back to the Mountain&rsquo;s fight with Oberyn. <b>Oberyn, who could have killed the Mountain years ago if he hadn&rsquo;t wanted revenge more than he wanted to stop the Mountain from brutalizing, torturing, or killing anyone else ever again</b>. <br /></p><p>But stopping him <b>is </b>what Sandor wanted most, so much that he could even overcome his worst fears. Sandor had a lifetime of the Mountain maiming and murdering countless people: Ripping dozens of daughters, mothers, fathers, sisters, sons, and brothers from their families; widowing who knows how many husbands and wives; and no one had been able to properly do anything about it for years and years. It&rsquo;s why he stepped between the Mountain and Loras all those years ago. Only this time, Sandor has the strength and ability to stop him for good.<br /></p><p>That&rsquo;s why he succeeds where Oberyn failed.</p><p>Near the beginning, it seemed like the Hound was introduced as a method of instigating Innocence Lost. But throughout the series, we see him become a champion for the innocent, such as Sansa and Arya and even Loras. In the end, Sandor takes out one of the most vicious and murderous characters (which is saying something) who is practically synonymous with the loss of innocence through brutality.</p><p>Yeah, he did it for himself but he also did it for his sister and father and their missing servants, for Elia and her babies, the prisoners at Harrenhal, and so many others. He did it for everyone who could have come in contact with Gregor in the future. The knowledge that the Mountain would never harm anyone again is probably what gave Sandor real peace.<br /></p><p>He just saw it as a bonus that Gregor got what he deserved and that Sandor&ndash;<i>not the Hound-</i>- got to give it to him.<br /></p>",
