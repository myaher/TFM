The obvious bits, like any moment where Bernard Cribbins is on screen, have been rightfully discussed, but what stood out to me about this episode most of all was Elisabeth Sladen. It feels odd to say it, but she\u2019s a much, much better actress than I ever realised - \u00a0not that I ever thought she wasn\u2019t, or anything, but it really struck me that every emotional beat of the Dalek invasion works because of her. It\u2019s her fear of the Daleks, at Davros, and for Luke, that makes it work \u2013 it\u2019s genuinely the most impactful performance of the episode.</p><p>It\u2019s quite the episode, <i>The Stolen Earth</i>. Quite the episode.</p><p>These days those action figures are all neatly displayed on my shelves \u2013 lovingly displayed, in fact. (I\u2019d have to concede they\u2019re actually maybe not that neat, and they pick up dust like mad.) I feel like maybe I should try and construct some metaphor out of that, that the things you love as a child start to hold a different place in your life as you grow up or whatever, but nah, that\u2019s nonsense. Or it\u2019s nonsense here, anyway.</p><p>I just wanted to tell you about them.

There\u2019s a lot of great moments. The obvious bits, like any moment where Bernard Cribbins is on screen, have been rightfully discussed, but what stood out to me about this episode most of all was Elisabeth Sladen. It feels odd to say it, but she\u2019s a much, much better actress than I ever realised - \u00a0not that I ever thought she wasn\u2019t, or anything, but it really struck me that every emotional beat of the Dalek invasion works because of her. It\u2019s her fear of the Daleks, at Davros, and for Luke, that makes it work \u2013 it\u2019s genuinely the most impactful performance of the episode.</p><p>It\u2019s quite the episode, <i>The Stolen Earth</i>. Quite the episode.</p><p>These days those action figures are all neatly displayed on my shelves \u2013 lovingly displayed, in fact. (I\u2019d have to concede they\u2019re actually maybe not that neat, and they pick up dust like mad.) I feel like maybe I should try and construct some metaphor out of that, that the things you love as a child start to hold a different place in your life as you grow up or whatever, but nah, that\u2019s nonsense. Or it\u2019s nonsense here, anyway.</p><p>I just wanted to tell you about them. I really love those things.</p><p><b>10/10</b></p><p><b>Related:</b></p><p><i><a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.alexmoreland.co.uk%2Ftagged%2Ften-years-of-the-tenth-doctor&amp;amp;t=ZjQ4ZDIwOWY0YTQzYzhlZjgwODI5MWZhOTBlZjU4MDFlMWUyMGI4NCxWc3FyVkpIOQ%3D%3D&amp;amp;b=t%3ACBHf4qP7pcJpuZ0gcApvEg&amp;amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fthoughts-from-alex.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F173779378280%2Ften-years-of-the-tenth-doctor-the-doctors&amp;amp;m=1\" target=\"_blank\">Ten Years of the Tenth Doctor Reviews</a></i></p><p><a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FAlexMorelandWriter&amp;amp;t=YmM4ZWQ2YjU0ZGIwNDY3YzY3OTFmMjNiMDczYjM3MTI4NWQzYWU3MyxPaUpwTlhPNA%3D%3D&amp;amp;b=t%3ACBHf4qP7pcJpuZ0gcApvEg&amp;amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fthoughts-from-alex.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F174001727200%2Ften-years-of-the-tenth-doctor-the-unicorn-and-the\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a> | <a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.alexmoreland.co.uk%2Fpost%2F172874046695%2Ften-years-of-the-tenth-doctor-the-fires-of&amp;amp;t=YzhhYTczOTEwMDAyNzVkOWIyM2QxOGRhYWUyNWZiOWE3ODhlNTg2ZCxWc3FyVkpIOQ%3D%3D&amp;amp;b=t%3ACBHf4qP7pcJpuZ0gcApvEg&amp;amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fthoughts-from-alex.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F173779378280%2Ften-years-of-the-tenth-doctor-the-doctors&amp;amp;m=1\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a> | <a href=\"https://twitter.com/morelandwriter\" target=\"_blank\">Blog Index</a> | <a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.alexmoreland.co.uk%2FIndex%2FDoctorWho&amp;amp;t=NzZmMzQ4MTgwZjI1N2Q1MWU0YTE1MjgyMzQ4ZjZmZWIxOTFiYTc4YixWc3FyVkpIOQ%3D%3D&amp;amp;b=t%3ACBHf4qP7pcJpuZ0gcApvEg&amp;amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fthoughts-from-alex.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F173779378280%2Ften-years-of-the-tenth-doctor-the-doctors&amp;amp;m=1\" target=\"_blank\">Doctor Who Index</a></p></p>",
