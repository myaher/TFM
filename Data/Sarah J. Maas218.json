Armen </p><p>Now there is two possibilities (if the stories are connected) I think that Armen is possibly Monan or Monan and Dorians daughter. Now for the first possiblity I believe this is true because she says that she is impossibly old. She also wasn\u2019t always fae. She had to change herself to escape the prison. She also explains to the inner circle that \u201cArmen\u201d wasn\u2019t always her name. </p><p>For the second possiblity I believe her to be the daughter if these two because Monan is most definitely not Fae she is a witch/valg. Also Armen has black hair unlike a witch who has white hair. But Dorian has black hair. Armen always was different. Now, I understand that when Armen had to change in the prison that her hair could have change to be better suit her new body. But when she was unmade in ACOWAR that she came out like a Phoenix. Is what I pictured. That doesn\u2019t really sound like a witch ability. But that is something Raw magic could do which is what Dorian had. Was Monan possibly pregnant when she was taken into the new world? </p><p>4. Valg </p><p>All of us know that the witches are half valg. Or connected to them. So when Aelin (or whoever closes the gate on the valg and gods) well it bring all the witches as well and that\u2019s how Armen/Monan/ maybe daughter ended up in a new world? Or did Aelin ask her to go and make sure the perfect court was made? Or is the Throne of Glass world destroyed by Aelin and she created Prythian? And Armen stayed alive to make the perfect court? Also what makes me to believe all the possibilities is that in ACOFAS Mor saw (more like felt) a darkness. And she described it as something evil and something powerful like a Valg prince. Now Sara J Maas could have added this little bit to miss lead us into believing it is the Bryaxis. When was possibly the Valg resurfacing. </p><h2>What do you guys think?  Let me know if you also have any theories or why u disagree with mine. But either way, we will get our answers When KOA comes out!! </h2>",
