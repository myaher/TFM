It was a large, crowded corridor much bigger than the others, of course, so all the students had enough space to handle the lockers. \u201cIt\u2019s like <i>the</i> corridor. Everyone gathers he\u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait a minute, I was the one leading the tour here!\u201d pouted Ned crossing his arms. You could do nothing but chuckle at his complaint.</p><p>\u201cBut Principal Morita asked me!\u201d he replied, crossing his arms as well. He seemed a little bit more confident now that he was with Ned, but still he was nervous to somehow make the fool of himself in front of you.</p><p>\u201cFine\u2026\u201d Ned gave in \u201cProceed\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you. Well, you prob\u2013\u201d Peter suddenly interrupted himself. He tilted his head and fixed his eyes on the center of your clavicle \u201cWait, d-do you like Harry Potter? I mean, your necklace\u2026\u201d</p><p><i>How observant!</i></p><p>You were indeed wearing a Harry Potter necklace that day.

Peter smiled too, shyly, his cheeks turning ruby red.</p><p>You smiled widely. This had definitely been a very good welcome. You never imagine you could be so fortunate to meet people as crazy as you, especially on your first day.

The three of you.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your first class, (Y/N)?\u201d asked Ned. He was such an awesome person. He was really funny and outgoing and made everything enjoyable with his occurrences and his cheerfulness.  You felt so fortunate to have met him. To have met both of them.</p><p> And you really liked how Peter was. I mean, you\u2019d just met him, but he\u2019d already won a place in your heart. He was very kind and funny and interesting and sweet. And for some reason, you found him extremely adorable.</p><p><i>(Y/N), please tell me you\u2019re not developing a crush on him. Don\u2019t. </i></p><p>Also, he was\u2026 Cute.</p><p><i>No! Stop. You just met him.

And honestly, it&rsquo;s not that good, haha. Don&rsquo;t hate me, please. It&rsquo;s late and I&rsquo;m in a transition period in my life so the idea came and I tried to write it down. <i><b>Still, I hope you enjoy it! &#128156;&#128156;&#128156;</b></i></p><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"0\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><p><i>Imagine being new at school and Principal Morita asking Peter to show you school.</i></p><p>~~~</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, so you must be our new student!&rdquo; Principal Morita exclaimed cheerfully. You&rsquo;d met him before when you and your parents went to ask for information about the school. Of course, he didn&rsquo;t seem to remember very well that you were there that day  &ldquo;Well, here&rsquo;s your schedule&hellip; But still you might need a tour around school&hellip;&rdquo; he thought about that matter for a few seconds, looking at the students passing, before his eyes reflected he&rsquo;d found a solution &ldquo;Parker!&rdquo; he called. Two boys that were just passing by stopped at the man&rsquo;s mention; one of them walked towards you two, his eyes widened in surprise and reflecting a bit of worry. One of his brown curls fell softly on his forehead, giving him an adorable look.</p><p>&ldquo;I want you to meet your new classmate, (Y/N) (Y/L)&rdquo; said Principal Morita motioning at you with his left hand. You gave the Parker boy a kind smile that tried to tell him he had nothing to worry about. Your message must have been caught by some of his neurons, because his expression relaxed slightly and he returned you the gesture &ldquo;And I wanted to ask you to be her&hellip; \"Tour guide&rdquo; around school\"</p><p>&ldquo;Oh&rdquo; so he didn&rsquo;t have to worry (at least not about getting expelled or something like that) indeed &ldquo;Y-yeah, sure&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Perfect!&rdquo; Morita turned to look at you &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be in good hands.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;T-thank you&rdquo; you responded, but by then the Principal had already left to his office, to do his job and mind his own business. You couldn&rsquo;t blame him: He was such a busy man; running a school is not an easy task.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, uh, welcome to Midtown, (Y/N)&rdquo; said the boy. You could notice he was still a bit nervous, but it was nothing compared to how nervous you were: Being new at school is tough. However, Principal Morita had improved the experience by providing you with a &ldquo;guide&rdquo; &ldquo;I-I&rsquo;m Peter, by the way&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, well, it&rsquo;s very nice to meet you, Peter&rdquo; you replied, your fingers fiddling with the hem of your sleeve. You had to admit that you weren&rsquo;t the best at making friends and the last thing you wanted was to do something stupid and screw everything up in front of Peter.</p><p>Peter walked to the other side of the hallway, were the boy who was accompanying him was standing; he&rsquo;d been waiting for him all along.</p><p> &ldquo;And this is Ned-&rdquo; started Peter.</p><p>&ldquo;-Leeds&rdquo; Ned interrupted, grinning.</p><p>&ldquo;Y-yeah. He&rsquo;s my best friend.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And his guy on the chair&hellip;&rdquo; murmured Ned. You cocked an eyebrow not knowing what he meant, yet amused by his comment.</p><p>&ldquo;Shush!&rdquo; Peter murmured back apprehensively &ldquo;Erm&hellip; T-this is (Y/N) (Y/L) and I-I&hellip; Principal Morita asked me to show her school&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Cool!&rdquo; exclaimed Ned joyfully &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s begin our tour, then. So the Principal&rsquo;s office is here, but of course you know that already&hellip;&rdquo; Ned kept talking while leading your way along the corridor, then your turned to the left and got to another corridor.
