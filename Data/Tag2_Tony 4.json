His problems start when he makes an impulse decision to jump over to 1946 and Peggy decides to go back home with him. It only gets more complicated from there when Howard tags along with them to 2023.</p><h2><b>Chapter One</b></h2><p>He wasn&rsquo;t sure what he&rsquo;d expected or if he&rsquo;d expected anything at all really. He hadn&rsquo;t had time to think about it as he&rsquo;d stared down his own living nightmare that threatened everyone and everything that he loved. A cheap trick and a cheesy one liner\u2026 funny thing, it really did sum him up in the end.</p><p>As the world faded away, Pepper&rsquo;s forced smile the last thing Tony saw, something else he couldn&rsquo;t quite make out started to take its place. Apparently this is what death was. Good to know. Maybe he&rsquo;d see Nat. Get a chance to tell her they won and that the others were safe. Or maybe he&rsquo;d see his parents. There was a lot he&rsquo;d like to say to his father, and none of it what he would have said just a few years before. He loved him. He knew he&rsquo;d done his best. It had been cathartic a few years ago to say those words in a simulation, but after meeting him in the past he thought he believed it now. He wanted to believe it now. Maybe his father would actually be proud of what his son had become.</p><p>The face that greeted him wasn&rsquo;t his fathers. It wasn&rsquo;t his mother or Natasha&rsquo;s. That quiet, knowing smile reached his eyes in a way Tony had never seen in life, and he felt himself echo it just a little. &ldquo;Yinsen.&rdquo;</p><p>The older man nodded over to a table with a backgammon board laid out, two barrels like the ones they had sat on in the cave so many years before set up for them. Tony wasn&rsquo;t sure if it had been there a moment before but, to be fair, he wasn&rsquo;t even really sure where he was.</p><p>&ldquo;A middle ground of a sort,&rdquo; Yinsen answered the unspoken question and took a seat.</p><p>Tony followed, sitting opposite of him and watching him carefully. &ldquo;Like Purgatory?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not quite.&rdquo;</p><p>Well that wasn&rsquo;t helpful. He let his gaze sweep the space as Yinsen set the board. As far as he could see they were the only ones there.</p><p>&ldquo;Stark.&rdquo;</p><p>He turned back, startled by the tone that sounded like he had called his name a couple times before he had actually heard it, and saw the set of offered dice in Yinsen&rsquo;s outstretched hand. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t get it.&rdquo;</p><p>The older man lifted a single brow in an amused expression. &ldquo;I seem to remember you having a good grasp on the rules of the game.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I mean why I&rsquo;m here.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;To play. And to talk. I have missed out talks, Stark.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony swallowed hard, finally taking the dice and rolling. 6-3. Not bad. &ldquo;Me too,&rdquo; he confessed softly as Yinsen picked them up. &ldquo;A lot&rsquo;s happened.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know.&rdquo; He rolled, landing only one point lower. &ldquo;Tell me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Tell you what?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Everything. We have time.&rdquo;</p><!-- more --><p>Tony pushed a long breath out through his nose and reached for the pieces for his move. As they played, he spoke. He told Yinsen about getting home, about how he&rsquo;d found out that his mentor was the one that had been selling his weapons under the table and how it had been the attack on Gulmira that had pushed him to creating the Iron Man suit. He told him about Pepper and Rhodey and Happy, the Avengers, and about Harley and Peter. About Morgan. His breath caught at his daughter&rsquo;s name and his jaw clenched, trying to keep some semblance of composure. He hadn&rsquo;t had a chance to say goodbye to her. Not really. He&rsquo;d left a video in case the worst happened, but it wasn&rsquo;t the same. He&rsquo;d never see her again. Never be able to hold her and tease her. He wouldn&rsquo;t get to watch her grow up or go to school. He wouldn&rsquo;t get to watch he change the world like he knew she would.</p><p>&ldquo;So,&rdquo; Yinsen murmured, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re a man that found everything.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony cleared his throat, struggling to find his voice. &ldquo;Guess I did.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then what are you doing here?&rdquo;</p><p>Tony looked up from where he was clutching the dice. &ldquo;Because I did whatever it took to save them,&rdquo; he answered.</p><p>&ldquo;And you died a hero.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I died to save them.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve come a long way, Stark. You certainly didn&rsquo;t waste your life.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You gave me a second chance. I took it.&rdquo; He tosses the dice down.</p><p>&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s it?&rdquo;</p><p>Tony looked up at him as the dice settled out in the board, not bothering to look down. &ldquo;What'dya mean?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I seem to remember a stubborn streak in you. One that wouldn&rsquo;t give up so easily.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not really my call anymore, is it?&rdquo;</p><p>Dark eyes flickered down to the board. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p><p>Tony followed his gaze down to the dice to see the winning roll. His lips quirked up, but the snarky comment died on them at the kind smile Yinsen wore. The younger man blinked hard in question, but as he opened his eyes he found himself in a completely different setting.</p><p>He was flat on his back and staring at a ceiling directly above him. The lights were too bright, the sound of the machinery deafening, and he couldn&rsquo;t breathe. He tried to reach up to his throat, but found his right arm unresponsive and his left tethered to\u2026. something. He wasn&rsquo;t sure what yet. Every last thought was consumed with the understanding that he was <i>choking</i> and he needed to make it stop.</p><p>Another alarm sounded as Tony tugged harder against whatever was tying him down, fingers finding something long and smooth inserted into his mouth and supposedly running down his throat. Getting it out was the next goal.</p><p>He could hear shouting in the distance and his name broke through the gaze of it. <i>Mr Stark</i> was followed by <i>Tony</i>. That voice. That voice he knew.</p><p>Pepper didn&rsquo;t seem to care what the people around her were telling her to do. She pushed past a man in a white coat and Tony felt her hand catch his as she came into his line of vision. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay. Tony, babe, it&rsquo;s okay. Just breathe.&rdquo;</p><p>He couldn&rsquo;t. That was the problem. There was something\u2026. he tried to reach for his throat again, but she wouldn&rsquo;t let go. Instead she pulled his hand up, pressing a kiss to his fingers. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a breathing tube, Tony. You&rsquo;re okay. It&rsquo;s there to help.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ma'am, we need to-&rdquo;</p><p>She shot the owner of the voice a glare that silenced him instantly, her expression softening as it turned back to him. &ldquo;Hey. Look at me.&rdquo; He did, feeling some of the panic subside. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re in the hospital. We made it. You&rsquo;re okay. You&rsquo;re going to be okay.&rdquo;</p><p>Tears stood in her eyes, but her smile wasn&rsquo;t forced. It was relieved, and slowly the pieces started to fit into place. He was alive. If Yinsen had been there or not, he couldn&rsquo;t be sure, but somehow he had managed to hang on until they had gotten him help. He tried to whisper her name, but only managed to choke against the tube again and she squeezed his hand. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be right here when you wake up,&rdquo; she promised and moved so that he could see a doctor pushing medication into the IV. It didn&rsquo;t take long until he felt himself slipping back under.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 ____________</p><p>They hadn&rsquo;t been able to tell her when or even if he would wake up. Pepper had ushered Peter out of the room for a much needed cup of coffee ten minutes before, knowing that if she didn&rsquo;t make the kid stretch his legs he would sit there all evening with her. It had become their ritual over the last two weeks: he would get off of school and immediately hop the train from Queens to Manhattan. A few days she was pretty sure he showed up before the school day should have ended, but she couldn&rsquo;t bring herself to chastise him over it. Peter would sit with Tony while Pepper would take Morgan for dinner and connect with Happy or Rhodey so that one of them could take her for a bit so that she could return to the hospital room. It wasn&rsquo;t like she was going to go home and sleep in her own bed anyway. That&rsquo;s when Peter was expected to head home, but he rarely did. There had been several nights that he&rsquo;d fallen asleep in the chair and wouldn&rsquo;t budge. Pepper tried to get him moving when she could bring herself to do it, but she understood. She didn&rsquo;t want to leave him either.</p><p>And the one time she had he had woken up in a panic, fighting the tube down his throat and nearly hurting himself. Pepper shook her head as she stepped out into the hall where she&rsquo;d left the kid. Leave it to Tony to wake up with a bang.</p><p>Steve Rogers stood with him, but Peter&rsquo;s attention tore over to her instantly and he stood. &ldquo;Is he okay? Is he-?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s alright,&rdquo; she assured him quickly, offering Steve a quick nod to greet him. &ldquo;The doctors needed to sedate him to get the tube out and check on him. They said he&rsquo;ll be in and out, but we should be able to see him as soon as they&rsquo;re done.&rdquo;</p><p>She could see the relief flood through him in the way the tension left his shoulders and they sagged, the weight of the last couple weeks leaving the teenager looking as tired as Pepper felt. &ldquo;Good. That&rsquo;s good, right? So he&rsquo;s out of the woods? Dr Palmer said him waking up would be a good sign, right? So he&rsquo;ll be okay?&rdquo;</p><p>Even exhausted, his energy was overwhelming. &ldquo;Yes, she seemed to think so. Steve, how are things going on your end?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I think we&rsquo;ve got everything in place,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;Bruce is running some last minute tests on it this evening. Or was. He&rsquo;s on his way over now.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not thinking of going himself, is he?&rdquo; Pepper asked. She knew he felt responsible for returning the stones, but between his own injuries and the fact that he&rsquo;d been instrumental in saving Tony&rsquo;s life with his research into gamma radiation, she didn&rsquo;t want to think about the possibility of losing him in this. Ten seconds on their end, from what she understood, but what if something went wrong? They needed him. Tony needed him. He was awake, but that was really only the start on the road to recovery.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, no. He&rsquo;s staying here. I&rsquo;m taking them. First thing in the morning if everything stays on course. That&rsquo;s why I wanted to\u2026&rdquo; Blue eyes darted past her and she couldn&rsquo;t help but think of the strained relationship that he had had with her husband the last handful of years. They&rsquo;d put it behind them to finish this, but she could see why he might question what that meant now that it was over. No one held a grudge quite like Tony Stark, but no one forgave like him either.</p><p>Pepper reached out, her light touch pulling him around. &ldquo;If you have a little bit, I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;d love to see you.&rdquo;</p><p>He flashed her a hesitant smile. &ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo;</p><p>Several of the medical staff filed out of the room and a doctor stopped. &ldquo;Ms Stark? He&rsquo;s coming back around if you wanted to-&rdquo;</p><p>Peter was nearly a blur as he bounded towards the door, slamming to a stop before he crossed the threshold. &ldquo;I, uh\u2026.. you should probably see him first,&rdquo; he said awkwardly.</p><p>&ldquo;How about together?&rdquo; she offered and his face lit up.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wait out here until you&rsquo;ve had some time with him,&rdquo; Steve offered and Pepper managed a grateful smile as they ducked in.</p><p>The doctor followed her as Peter moved towards his mentor with as much restraint as he seemed able to cobble together. Pepper watched Tony&rsquo;s lips twitch up on the left side, the burns on the right side of his face making it difficult for him to smile fully. The doctor at her side spoke quietly, explains that Dr Palmer would want to do a more thorough examination as soon as she was in, but his vitals looked as good as could be expected. As they had anticipated, he had very little movement in his right arm and the burns that stretched down his right side would hinder mobility. Physical therapy would be required to get any sort of movement back and they had already sent Dr Banner the newest set of information so that he could adjust his own treatments that he&rsquo;d prescribed that had kept Tony alive.</p><p>Pepper half listened, but found her attention tapering off to the excited teenager that was telling Tony some story with a full range of motions, hands flying and he was bouncing just a little. He didn&rsquo;t stop until Tony reached his left hand up, clumsily reaching for him. The dam seemed to break as the teen took it and tears started to spill over. &ldquo;I was so scared, Mr Stark.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ms Stark?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; Pepper answered automatically.</p><p>&ldquo;Is there anything else?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, thank you. For everything.&rdquo; She waited until he was gone and steeled herself. Tony already had one blubbering person leaned over him. She&rsquo;d be damned if she made it two.</p><p>Poise carefully back in place she crossed the room and found a set of dark eyes on her. &ldquo;Hey, Pep,&rdquo; he greeted hoarsely and her poise shattered cracked instantly. Peter had the good sense to move out of her way as she circled around and took his outreached hand. &ldquo;Those tears aren&rsquo;t for me, are they?&rdquo;</p><p>The laugh escaped and she leaned down, pressing a kiss to the side of his mouth. &ldquo;I thought we&rsquo;d lost you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Too much to come home to,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;You okay?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Morgan?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s with Happy. They&rsquo;re on their way.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony gave the smallest of nods. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t wait to see her.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;ll be plenty of time.&rdquo; She glanced back at the door. &ldquo;Steve&rsquo;s here.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Cap?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Huh.&rdquo; The sound was quiet and he seemed to be settling back into the pillows a little deeper.</p><p>Pepper&rsquo;s phone buzzed, signaling Happy&rsquo;s arrival. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to go get Morgan. You want me to send him in?&rdquo;</p><p>Tony gave the barest of mods and she caught Peter by the jacket sleeve. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you come help me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What? You don&rsquo;t need me to-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Give them a moment,&rdquo; she pressed and Peter seemed to clue in and nodded, following her out of the room.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0____________<br/></p><p>Steve lingered at the door, blue gaze fixed on what looked like a sleeping man inside. Not for the first time he was struck at how many similarities there were between Tony and his father, even now that Tony was a good twenty-five years older than Howard had been when Steve had first met him. Stubborn, brilliant, and oftentimes reckless, it was hard not to care about the man, even when he drove him up the wall.</p><p>A pair of brown eyes very similar to Howard&rsquo;s cracked open and Tony offered a small wave. &ldquo;Cap.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hey,&rdquo; the older man greeted as he crossed the space. &ldquo;How&rsquo;re you feeling?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;d say I&rsquo;ve been worse, but I outdid myself this time.&rdquo; The rough chuckle ended with a cough and a wince. &ldquo;Rumour is that I&rsquo;ll live.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You better. Not sure the world could survive without you.&rdquo;</p><p>That earned him an amused snort. &ldquo;Better stop playing hero, huh?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I said that a long time ago,&rdquo; Steve countered, not sure if Tony was being serious or not.</p><p>&ldquo;And I never got an apology for it.&rdquo;</p><p>There it was. The blond shook his head, chuckling. &ldquo;Seriously, Tony. I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;re okay.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks. You too.&rdquo; He cleared his throat. &ldquo;Kid said you&rsquo;re taking the stones in the morning?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah. That&rsquo;s the plan.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Good. No reason to screw with time any more than we have. Maybe that&rsquo;ll help set it straight.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We hope so.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve probably messed with time enough,&rdquo; Tony said softly, but his gaze flickered up, catching Steve&rsquo;s. &ldquo;No regrets though. I think we did good, all things considered.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We did. Listen, Tony -&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Daddy</i>!&rdquo;</p><p>The squeal from the door drew both men&rsquo;s attention and Morgan Stark bounded into the room, her mother right behind her. &ldquo;Remember what I said. Gentle.&rdquo;</p><p>The little girl slowed down by the bed, but didn&rsquo;t stop. She was just careful as she climbed up. &ldquo;I knew you&rsquo;d wake up,&rdquo; she told him and Tony&rsquo;s smile was soft.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah? You tell them all that?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;C'mere,&rdquo; he prompted and she instantly snuggled down against him, burrowed into his uninjured shoulder and holding on tight. Tony looked back up to Steve. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see you when you get back, yeah? Try not to get lost. We need you.&rdquo;</p><p>The words hit hard, the meaning even harder. The forgiveness was stretching on past necessity. Tony was choosing it, not just resigning to it. Steve offered him a smile. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be back before you know it,&rdquo; he promised and turned to leave his friend with his family gathering around him. He would be okay. He might never be made physically whole again, but he&rsquo;d be okay. After being willing to fall on the grenade for them, he deserved that much at the very least. Now it was Steve&rsquo;s job to make sure that others didn&rsquo;t suffer because of what they had had to do.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0____________<br/></p><p>TBC</p><p><b>Notes</b>: I have been trying to tell this plot bunny no for too long and it just wouldn&rsquo;t listen, so here we go.</p><p><b>Next time</b>: Steve&rsquo;s trip does not go as planned for anyone involved.</p>",

His problems start when he makes an impulse decision to jump over to 1946 and Peggy decides to go back home with him. It only gets more complicated from there when Howard tags along with them to 2023.</p><h2><b>Chapter One</b></h2><p>He wasn\u2019t sure what he\u2019d expected or if he\u2019d expected anything at all really. He hadn\u2019t had time to think about it as he\u2019d stared down his own living nightmare that threatened everyone and everything that he loved. A cheap trick and a cheesy one liner\u2026 funny thing, it really did sum him up in the end.</p><p>As the world faded away, Pepper\u2019s forced smile the last thing Tony saw, something else he couldn\u2019t quite make out started to take its place. Apparently this is what death was. Good to know. Maybe he\u2019d see Nat. Get a chance to tell her they won and that the others were safe. Or maybe he\u2019d see his parents. There was a lot he\u2019d like to say to his father, and none of it what he would have said just a few years before. He loved him. He knew he\u2019d done his best. It had been cathartic a few years ago to say those words in a simulation, but after meeting him in the past he thought he believed it now. He wanted to believe it now. Maybe his father would actually be proud of what his son had become.</p><p>The face that greeted him wasn\u2019t his fathers. It wasn\u2019t his mother or Natasha\u2019s. That quiet, knowing smile reached his eyes in a way Tony had never seen in life, and he felt himself echo it just a little. \u201cYinsen.\u201d</p><p>The older man nodded over to a table with a backgammon board laid out, two barrels like the ones they had sat on in the cave so many years before set up for them. Tony wasn\u2019t sure if it had been there a moment before but, to be fair, he wasn\u2019t even really sure where he was.</p><p>\u201cA middle ground of a sort,\u201d Yinsen answered the unspoken question and took a seat.</p><p>Tony followed, sitting opposite of him and watching him carefully. \u201cLike Purgatory?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot quite.\u201d</p><p>Well that wasn\u2019t helpful. He let his gaze sweep the space as Yinsen set the board. As far as he could see they were the only ones there.</p><p>\u201cStark.\u201d</p><p>He turned back, startled by the tone that sounded like he had called his name a couple times before he had actually heard it, and saw the set of offered dice in Yinsen\u2019s outstretched hand. \u201cI don\u2019t get it.\u201d</p><p>The older man lifted a single brow in an amused expression. \u201cI seem to remember you having a good grasp on the rules of the game.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean why I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo play. And to talk. I have missed out talks, Stark.\u201d</p><p>Tony swallowed hard, finally taking the dice and rolling. 6-3. Not bad. \u201cMe too,\u201d he confessed softly as Yinsen picked them up. \u201cA lot\u2019s happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d He rolled, landing only one point lower. \u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell you what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything. We have time.\u201d</p>[[MORE]]<p>Tony pushed a long breath out through his nose and reached for the pieces for his move. As they played, he spoke. He told Yinsen about getting home, about how he\u2019d found out that his mentor was the one that had been selling his weapons under the table and how it had been the attack on Gulmira that had pushed him to creating the Iron Man suit. He told him about Pepper and Rhodey and Happy, the Avengers, and about Harley and Peter. About Morgan. His breath caught at his daughter\u2019s name and his jaw clenched, trying to keep some semblance of composure. He hadn\u2019t had a chance to say goodbye to her. Not really. He\u2019d left a video in case the worst happened, but it wasn\u2019t the same. He\u2019d never see her again. Never be able to hold her and tease her. He wouldn\u2019t get to watch her grow up or go to school. He wouldn\u2019t get to watch he change the world like he knew she would.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Yinsen murmured, \u201cyou\u2019re a man that found everything.\u201d</p><p>Tony cleared his throat, struggling to find his voice. \u201cGuess I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>Tony looked up from where he was clutching the dice. \u201cBecause I did whatever it took to save them,\u201d he answered.</p><p>\u201cAnd you died a hero.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI died to save them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve come a long way, Stark. You certainly didn\u2019t waste your life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou gave me a second chance. I took it.\u201d He tosses the dice down.</p><p>\u201cSo that\u2019s it?\u201d</p><p>Tony looked up at him as the dice settled out in the board, not bothering to look down. \u201cWhat'dya mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI seem to remember a stubborn streak in you. One that wouldn\u2019t give up so easily.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really my call anymore, is it?\u201d</p><p>Dark eyes flickered down to the board. \u201cIsn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Tony followed his gaze down to the dice to see the winning roll. His lips quirked up, but the snarky comment died on them at the kind smile Yinsen wore. The younger man blinked hard in question, but as he opened his eyes he found himself in a completely different setting.</p><p>He was flat on his back and staring at a ceiling directly above him. The lights were too bright, the sound of the machinery deafening, and he couldn\u2019t breathe. He tried to reach up to his throat, but found his right arm unresponsive and his left tethered to\u2026. something. He wasn\u2019t sure what yet. Every last thought was consumed with the understanding that he was <i>choking</i> and he needed to make it stop.</p><p>Another alarm sounded as Tony tugged harder against whatever was tying him down, fingers finding something long and smooth inserted into his mouth and supposedly running down his throat. Getting it out was the next goal.</p><p>He could hear shouting in the distance and his name broke through the gaze of it. <i>Mr Stark</i> was followed by <i>Tony</i>. That voice. That voice he knew.</p><p>Pepper didn\u2019t seem to care what the people around her were telling her to do. She pushed past a man in a white coat and Tony felt her hand catch his as she came into his line of vision. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. Tony, babe, it\u2019s okay. Just breathe.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t. That was the problem. There was something\u2026. he tried to reach for his throat again, but she wouldn\u2019t let go. Instead she pulled his hand up, pressing a kiss to his fingers. \u201cIt\u2019s a breathing tube, Tony. You\u2019re okay. It\u2019s there to help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMa'am, we need to-\u201d</p><p>She shot the owner of the voice a glare that silenced him instantly, her expression softening as it turned back to him. \u201cHey. Look at me.\u201d He did, feeling some of the panic subside. \u201cYou\u2019re in the hospital. We made it. You\u2019re okay. You\u2019re going to be okay.\u201d</p><p>Tears stood in her eyes, but her smile wasn\u2019t forced. It was relieved, and slowly the pieces started to fit into place. He was alive. If Yinsen had been there or not, he couldn\u2019t be sure, but somehow he had managed to hang on until they had gotten him help. He tried to whisper her name, but only managed to choke against the tube again and she squeezed his hand. \u201cI\u2019ll be right here when you wake up,\u201d she promised and moved so that he could see a doctor pushing medication into the IV. It didn\u2019t take long until he felt himself slipping back under.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 ____________</p><p>They hadn\u2019t been able to tell her when or even if he would wake up. Pepper had ushered Peter out of the room for a much needed cup of coffee ten minutes before, knowing that if she didn\u2019t make the kid stretch his legs he would sit there all evening with her. It had become their ritual over the last two weeks: he would get off of school and immediately hop the train from Queens to Manhattan. A few days she was pretty sure he showed up before the school day should have ended, but she couldn\u2019t bring herself to chastise him over it. Peter would sit with Tony while Pepper would take Morgan for dinner and connect with Happy or Rhodey so that one of them could take her for a bit so that she could return to the hospital room. It wasn\u2019t like she was going to go home and sleep in her own bed anyway. That\u2019s when Peter was expected to head home, but he rarely did. There had been several nights that he\u2019d fallen asleep in the chair and wouldn\u2019t budge. Pepper tried to get him moving when she could bring herself to do it, but she understood. She didn\u2019t want to leave him either.</p><p>And the one time she had he had woken up in a panic, fighting the tube down his throat and nearly hurting himself. Pepper shook her head as she stepped out into the hall where she\u2019d left the kid. Leave it to Tony to wake up with a bang.</p><p>Steve Rogers stood with him, but Peter\u2019s attention tore over to her instantly and he stood. \u201cIs he okay? Is he-?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s alright,\u201d she assured him quickly, offering Steve a quick nod to greet him. \u201cThe doctors needed to sedate him to get the tube out and check on him. They said he\u2019ll be in and out, but we should be able to see him as soon as they\u2019re done.\u201d</p><p>She could see the relief flood through him in the way the tension left his shoulders and they sagged, the weight of the last couple weeks leaving the teenager looking as tired as Pepper felt. \u201cGood. That\u2019s good, right? So he\u2019s out of the woods? Dr Palmer said him waking up would be a good sign, right? So he\u2019ll be okay?\u201d</p><p>Even exhausted, his energy was overwhelming. \u201cYes, she seemed to think so. Steve, how are things going on your end?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think we\u2019ve got everything in place,\u201d he answered. \u201cBruce is running some last minute tests on it this evening. Or was. He\u2019s on his way over now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not thinking of going himself, is he?\u201d Pepper asked. She knew he felt responsible for returning the stones, but between his own injuries and the fact that he\u2019d been instrumental in saving Tony\u2019s life with his research into gamma radiation, she didn\u2019t want to think about the possibility of losing him in this. Ten seconds on their end, from what she understood, but what if something went wrong? They needed him. Tony needed him. He was awake, but that was really only the start on the road to recovery.</p><p>\u201cOh, no. He\u2019s staying here. I\u2019m taking them. First thing in the morning if everything stays on course. That\u2019s why I wanted to\u2026\u201d Blue eyes darted past her and she couldn\u2019t help but think of the strained relationship that he had had with her husband the last handful of years. They\u2019d put it behind them to finish this, but she could see why he might question what that meant now that it was over. No one held a grudge quite like Tony Stark, but no one forgave like him either.</p><p>Pepper reached out, her light touch pulling him around. \u201cIf you have a little bit, I\u2019m sure he\u2019d love to see you.\u201d</p><p>He flashed her a hesitant smile. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Several of the medical staff filed out of the room and a doctor stopped. \u201cMs Stark? He\u2019s coming back around if you wanted to-\u201d</p><p>Peter was nearly a blur as he bounded towards the door, slamming to a stop before he crossed the threshold. \u201cI, uh\u2026.. you should probably see him first,\u201d he said awkwardly.</p><p>\u201cHow about together?\u201d she offered and his face lit up.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll wait out here until you\u2019ve had some time with him,\u201d Steve offered and Pepper managed a grateful smile as they ducked in.</p><p>The doctor followed her as Peter moved towards his mentor with as much restraint as he seemed able to cobble together. Pepper watched Tony\u2019s lips twitch up on the left side, the burns on the right side of his face making it difficult for him to smile fully. The doctor at her side spoke quietly, explains that Dr Palmer would want to do a more thorough examination as soon as she was in, but his vitals looked as good as could be expected. As they had anticipated, he had very little movement in his right arm and the burns that stretched down his right side would hinder mobility. Physical therapy would be required to get any sort of movement back and they had already sent Dr Banner the newest set of information so that he could adjust his own treatments that he\u2019d prescribed that had kept Tony alive.</p><p>Pepper half listened, but found her attention tapering off to the excited teenager that was telling Tony some story with a full range of motions, hands flying and he was bouncing just a little. He didn\u2019t stop until Tony reached his left hand up, clumsily reaching for him. The dam seemed to break as the teen took it and tears started to spill over. \u201cI was so scared, Mr Stark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMs Stark?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d Pepper answered automatically.</p><p>\u201cIs there anything else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you. For everything.\u201d She waited until he was gone and steeled herself. Tony already had one blubbering person leaned over him. She\u2019d be damned if she made it two.</p><p>Poise carefully back in place she crossed the room and found a set of dark eyes on her. \u201cHey, Pep,\u201d he greeted hoarsely and her poise shattered cracked instantly. Peter had the good sense to move out of her way as she circled around and took his outreached hand. \u201cThose tears aren\u2019t for me, are they?\u201d</p><p>The laugh escaped and she leaned down, pressing a kiss to the side of his mouth. \u201cI thought we\u2019d lost you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo much to come home to,\u201d he answered. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMorgan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s with Happy. They\u2019re on their way.\u201d</p><p>Tony gave the smallest of nods. \u201cCan\u2019t wait to see her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019ll be plenty of time.\u201d She glanced back at the door. \u201cSteve\u2019s here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCap?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh.\u201d The sound was quiet and he seemed to be settling back into the pillows a little deeper.</p><p>Pepper\u2019s phone buzzed, signaling Happy\u2019s arrival. \u201cI\u2019m going to go get Morgan. You want me to send him in?\u201d</p><p>Tony gave the barest of mods and she caught Peter by the jacket sleeve. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you come help me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? You don\u2019t need me to-\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive them a moment,\u201d she pressed and Peter seemed to clue in and nodded, following her out of the room.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0____________<br></p><p>Steve lingered at the door, blue gaze fixed on what looked like a sleeping man inside. Not for the first time he was struck at how many similarities there were between Tony and his father, even now that Tony was a good twenty-five years older than Howard had been when Steve had first met him. Stubborn, brilliant, and oftentimes reckless, it was hard not to care about the man, even when he drove him up the wall.</p><p>A pair of brown eyes very similar to Howard\u2019s cracked open and Tony offered a small wave. \u201cCap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d the older man greeted as he crossed the space. \u201cHow\u2019re you feeling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019d say I\u2019ve been worse, but I outdid myself this time.\u201d The rough chuckle ended with a cough and a wince. \u201cRumour is that I\u2019ll live.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou better. Not sure the world could survive without you.\u201d</p><p>That earned him an amused snort. \u201cBetter stop playing hero, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said that a long time ago,\u201d Steve countered, not sure if Tony was being serious or not.</p><p>\u201cAnd I never got an apology for it.\u201d</p><p>There it was. The blond shook his head, chuckling. \u201cSeriously, Tony. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. You too.\u201d He cleared his throat. \u201cKid said you\u2019re taking the stones in the morning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. That\u2019s the plan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. No reason to screw with time any more than we have. Maybe that\u2019ll help set it straight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe hope so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve probably messed with time enough,\u201d Tony said softly, but his gaze flickered up, catching Steve\u2019s. \u201cNo regrets though. I think we did good, all things considered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe did. Listen, Tony -\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Daddy</i>!\u201d</p><p>The squeal from the door drew both men\u2019s attention and Morgan Stark bounded into the room, her mother right behind her. \u201cRemember what I said. Gentle.\u201d</p><p>The little girl slowed down by the bed, but didn\u2019t stop. She was just careful as she climbed up. \u201cI knew you\u2019d wake up,\u201d she told him and Tony\u2019s smile was soft.</p><p>\u201cYeah? You tell them all that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cC'mere,\u201d he prompted and she instantly snuggled down against him, burrowed into his uninjured shoulder and holding on tight. Tony looked back up to Steve. \u201cI\u2019ll see you when you get back, yeah? Try not to get lost. We need you.\u201d</p><p>The words hit hard, the meaning even harder. The forgiveness was stretching on past necessity. Tony was choosing it, not just resigning to it. Steve offered him a smile. \u201cI\u2019ll be back before you know it,\u201d he promised and turned to leave his friend with his family gathering around him. He would be okay. He might never be made physically whole again, but he\u2019d be okay. After being willing to fall on the grenade for them, he deserved that much at the very least. Now it was Steve\u2019s job to make sure that others didn\u2019t suffer because of what they had had to do.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0____________<br></p><p>TBC</p><p><b>Notes</b>: I have been trying to tell this plot bunny no for too long and it just wouldn\u2019t listen, so here we go.</p><p><b>Next time</b>: Steve\u2019s trip does not go as planned for anyone involved.</p>",

His problems start when he makes an impulse decision to jump over to 1946 and Peggy decides to go back home with him. It only gets more complicated from there when Howard tags along with them to 2023.</p><h2><b>Chapter One</b></h2><p>He wasn\u2019t sure what he\u2019d expected or if he\u2019d expected anything at all really. He hadn\u2019t had time to think about it as he\u2019d stared down his own living nightmare that threatened everyone and everything that he loved. A cheap trick and a cheesy one liner\u2026 funny thing, it really did sum him up in the end.</p><p>As the world faded away, Pepper\u2019s forced smile the last thing Tony saw, something else he couldn\u2019t quite make out started to take its place. Apparently this is what death was. Good to know. Maybe he\u2019d see Nat. Get a chance to tell her they won and that the others were safe. Or maybe he\u2019d see his parents. There was a lot he\u2019d like to say to his father, and none of it what he would have said just a few years before. He loved him. He knew he\u2019d done his best. It had been cathartic a few years ago to say those words in a simulation, but after meeting him in the past he thought he believed it now. He wanted to believe it now. Maybe his father would actually be proud of what his son had become.</p><p>The face that greeted him wasn\u2019t his fathers. It wasn\u2019t his mother or Natasha\u2019s. That quiet, knowing smile reached his eyes in a way Tony had never seen in life, and he felt himself echo it just a little. \u201cYinsen.\u201d</p><p>The older man nodded over to a table with a backgammon board laid out, two barrels like the ones they had sat on in the cave so many years before set up for them. Tony wasn\u2019t sure if it had been there a moment before but, to be fair, he wasn\u2019t even really sure where he was.</p><p>\u201cA middle ground of a sort,\u201d Yinsen answered the unspoken question and took a seat.</p><p>Tony followed, sitting opposite of him and watching him carefully. \u201cLike Purgatory?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot quite.\u201d</p><p>Well that wasn\u2019t helpful. He let his gaze sweep the space as Yinsen set the board. As far as he could see they were the only ones there.</p><p>\u201cStark.\u201d</p><p>He turned back, startled by the tone that sounded like he had called his name a couple times before he had actually heard it, and saw the set of offered dice in Yinsen\u2019s outstretched hand. \u201cI don\u2019t get it.\u201d</p><p>The older man lifted a single brow in an amused expression. \u201cI seem to remember you having a good grasp on the rules of the game.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean why I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo play. And to talk. I have missed out talks, Stark.\u201d</p><p>Tony swallowed hard, finally taking the dice and rolling. 6-3. Not bad. \u201cMe too,\u201d he confessed softly as Yinsen picked them up. \u201cA lot\u2019s happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d He rolled, landing only one point lower. \u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell you what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything. We have time.\u201d</p>[[MORE]]<p>Tony pushed a long breath out through his nose and reached for the pieces for his move. As they played, he spoke. He told Yinsen about getting home, about how he\u2019d found out that his mentor was the one that had been selling his weapons under the table and how it had been the attack on Gulmira that had pushed him to creating the Iron Man suit. He told him about Pepper and Rhodey and Happy, the Avengers, and about Harley and Peter. About Morgan. His breath caught at his daughter\u2019s name and his jaw clenched, trying to keep some semblance of composure. He hadn\u2019t had a chance to say goodbye to her. Not really. He\u2019d left a video in case the worst happened, but it wasn\u2019t the same. He\u2019d never see her again. Never be able to hold her and tease her. He wouldn\u2019t get to watch her grow up or go to school. He wouldn\u2019t get to watch he change the world like he knew she would.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Yinsen murmured, \u201cyou\u2019re a man that found everything.\u201d</p><p>Tony cleared his throat, struggling to find his voice. \u201cGuess I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>Tony looked up from where he was clutching the dice. \u201cBecause I did whatever it took to save them,\u201d he answered.</p><p>\u201cAnd you died a hero.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI died to save them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve come a long way, Stark. You certainly didn\u2019t waste your life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou gave me a second chance. I took it.\u201d He tosses the dice down.</p><p>\u201cSo that\u2019s it?\u201d</p><p>Tony looked up at him as the dice settled out in the board, not bothering to look down. \u201cWhat'dya mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI seem to remember a stubborn streak in you. One that wouldn\u2019t give up so easily.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really my call anymore, is it?\u201d</p><p>Dark eyes flickered down to the board. \u201cIsn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Tony followed his gaze down to the dice to see the winning roll. His lips quirked up, but the snarky comment died on them at the kind smile Yinsen wore. The younger man blinked hard in question, but as he opened his eyes he found himself in a completely different setting.</p><p>He was flat on his back and staring at a ceiling directly above him. The lights were too bright, the sound of the machinery deafening, and he couldn\u2019t breathe. He tried to reach up to his throat, but found his right arm unresponsive and his left tethered to\u2026. something. He wasn\u2019t sure what yet. Every last thought was consumed with the understanding that he was <i>choking</i> and he needed to make it stop.</p><p>Another alarm sounded as Tony tugged harder against whatever was tying him down, fingers finding something long and smooth inserted into his mouth and supposedly running down his throat. Getting it out was the next goal.</p><p>He could hear shouting in the distance and his name broke through the gaze of it. <i>Mr Stark</i> was followed by <i>Tony</i>. That voice. That voice he knew.</p><p>Pepper didn\u2019t seem to care what the people around her were telling her to do. She pushed past a man in a white coat and Tony felt her hand catch his as she came into his line of vision. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. Tony, babe, it\u2019s okay. Just breathe.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t. That was the problem. There was something\u2026. he tried to reach for his throat again, but she wouldn\u2019t let go. Instead she pulled his hand up, pressing a kiss to his fingers. \u201cIt\u2019s a breathing tube, Tony. You\u2019re okay. It\u2019s there to help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMa'am, we need to-\u201d</p><p>She shot the owner of the voice a glare that silenced him instantly, her expression softening as it turned back to him. \u201cHey. Look at me.\u201d He did, feeling some of the panic subside. \u201cYou\u2019re in the hospital. We made it. You\u2019re okay. You\u2019re going to be okay.\u201d</p><p>Tears stood in her eyes, but her smile wasn\u2019t forced. It was relieved, and slowly the pieces started to fit into place. He was alive. If Yinsen had been there or not, he couldn\u2019t be sure, but somehow he had managed to hang on until they had gotten him help. He tried to whisper her name, but only managed to choke against the tube again and she squeezed his hand. \u201cI\u2019ll be right here when you wake up,\u201d she promised and moved so that he could see a doctor pushing medication into the IV. It didn\u2019t take long until he felt himself slipping back under.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 ____________</p><p>They hadn\u2019t been able to tell her when or even if he would wake up. Pepper had ushered Peter out of the room for a much needed cup of coffee ten minutes before, knowing that if she didn\u2019t make the kid stretch his legs he would sit there all evening with her. It had become their ritual over the last two weeks: he would get off of school and immediately hop the train from Queens to Manhattan. A few days she was pretty sure he showed up before the school day should have ended, but she couldn\u2019t bring herself to chastise him over it. Peter would sit with Tony while Pepper would take Morgan for dinner and connect with Happy or Rhodey so that one of them could take her for a bit so that she could return to the hospital room. It wasn\u2019t like she was going to go home and sleep in her own bed anyway. That\u2019s when Peter was expected to head home, but he rarely did. There had been several nights that he\u2019d fallen asleep in the chair and wouldn\u2019t budge. Pepper tried to get him moving when she could bring herself to do it, but she understood. She didn\u2019t want to leave him either.</p><p>And the one time she had he had woken up in a panic, fighting the tube down his throat and nearly hurting himself. Pepper shook her head as she stepped out into the hall where she\u2019d left the kid. Leave it to Tony to wake up with a bang.</p><p>Steve Rogers stood with him, but Peter\u2019s attention tore over to her instantly and he stood. \u201cIs he okay? Is he-?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s alright,\u201d she assured him quickly, offering Steve a quick nod to greet him. \u201cThe doctors needed to sedate him to get the tube out and check on him. They said he\u2019ll be in and out, but we should be able to see him as soon as they\u2019re done.\u201d</p><p>She could see the relief flood through him in the way the tension left his shoulders and they sagged, the weight of the last couple weeks leaving the teenager looking as tired as Pepper felt. \u201cGood. That\u2019s good, right? So he\u2019s out of the woods? Dr Palmer said him waking up would be a good sign, right? So he\u2019ll be okay?\u201d</p><p>Even exhausted, his energy was overwhelming. \u201cYes, she seemed to think so. Steve, how are things going on your end?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think we\u2019ve got everything in place,\u201d he answered. \u201cBruce is running some last minute tests on it this evening. Or was. He\u2019s on his way over now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not thinking of going himself, is he?\u201d Pepper asked. She knew he felt responsible for returning the stones, but between his own injuries and the fact that he\u2019d been instrumental in saving Tony\u2019s life with his research into gamma radiation, she didn\u2019t want to think about the possibility of losing him in this. Ten seconds on their end, from what she understood, but what if something went wrong? They needed him. Tony needed him. He was awake, but that was really only the start on the road to recovery.</p><p>\u201cOh, no. He\u2019s staying here. I\u2019m taking them. First thing in the morning if everything stays on course. That\u2019s why I wanted to\u2026\u201d Blue eyes darted past her and she couldn\u2019t help but think of the strained relationship that he had had with her husband the last handful of years. They\u2019d put it behind them to finish this, but she could see why he might question what that meant now that it was over. No one held a grudge quite like Tony Stark, but no one forgave like him either.</p><p>Pepper reached out, her light touch pulling him around. \u201cIf you have a little bit, I\u2019m sure he\u2019d love to see you.\u201d</p><p>He flashed her a hesitant smile. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Several of the medical staff filed out of the room and a doctor stopped. \u201cMs Stark? He\u2019s coming back around if you wanted to-\u201d</p><p>Peter was nearly a blur as he bounded towards the door, slamming to a stop before he crossed the threshold. \u201cI, uh\u2026.. you should probably see him first,\u201d he said awkwardly.</p><p>\u201cHow about together?\u201d she offered and his face lit up.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll wait out here until you\u2019ve had some time with him,\u201d Steve offered and Pepper managed a grateful smile as they ducked in.</p><p>The doctor followed her as Peter moved towards his mentor with as much restraint as he seemed able to cobble together. Pepper watched Tony\u2019s lips twitch up on the left side, the burns on the right side of his face making it difficult for him to smile fully. The doctor at her side spoke quietly, explains that Dr Palmer would want to do a more thorough examination as soon as she was in, but his vitals looked as good as could be expected. As they had anticipated, he had very little movement in his right arm and the burns that stretched down his right side would hinder mobility. Physical therapy would be required to get any sort of movement back and they had already sent Dr Banner the newest set of information so that he could adjust his own treatments that he\u2019d prescribed that had kept Tony alive.</p><p>Pepper half listened, but found her attention tapering off to the excited teenager that was telling Tony some story with a full range of motions, hands flying and he was bouncing just a little. He didn\u2019t stop until Tony reached his left hand up, clumsily reaching for him. The dam seemed to break as the teen took it and tears started to spill over. \u201cI was so scared, Mr Stark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMs Stark?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d Pepper answered automatically.</p><p>\u201cIs there anything else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you. For everything.\u201d She waited until he was gone and steeled herself. Tony already had one blubbering person leaned over him. She\u2019d be damned if she made it two.</p><p>Poise carefully back in place she crossed the room and found a set of dark eyes on her. \u201cHey, Pep,\u201d he greeted hoarsely and her poise shattered cracked instantly. Peter had the good sense to move out of her way as she circled around and took his outreached hand. \u201cThose tears aren\u2019t for me, are they?\u201d</p><p>The laugh escaped and she leaned down, pressing a kiss to the side of his mouth. \u201cI thought we\u2019d lost you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo much to come home to,\u201d he answered. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMorgan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s with Happy. They\u2019re on their way.\u201d</p><p>Tony gave the smallest of nods. \u201cCan\u2019t wait to see her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019ll be plenty of time.\u201d She glanced back at the door. \u201cSteve\u2019s here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCap?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh.\u201d The sound was quiet and he seemed to be settling back into the pillows a little deeper.</p><p>Pepper\u2019s phone buzzed, signaling Happy\u2019s arrival. \u201cI\u2019m going to go get Morgan. You want me to send him in?\u201d</p><p>Tony gave the barest of mods and she caught Peter by the jacket sleeve. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you come help me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? You don\u2019t need me to-\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive them a moment,\u201d she pressed and Peter seemed to clue in and nodded, following her out of the room.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0____________<br></p><p>Steve lingered at the door, blue gaze fixed on what looked like a sleeping man inside. Not for the first time he was struck at how many similarities there were between Tony and his father, even now that Tony was a good twenty-five years older than Howard had been when Steve had first met him. Stubborn, brilliant, and oftentimes reckless, it was hard not to care about the man, even when he drove him up the wall.</p><p>A pair of brown eyes very similar to Howard\u2019s cracked open and Tony offered a small wave. \u201cCap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d the older man greeted as he crossed the space. \u201cHow\u2019re you feeling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019d say I\u2019ve been worse, but I outdid myself this time.\u201d The rough chuckle ended with a cough and a wince. \u201cRumour is that I\u2019ll live.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou better. Not sure the world could survive without you.\u201d</p><p>That earned him an amused snort. \u201cBetter stop playing hero, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said that a long time ago,\u201d Steve countered, not sure if Tony was being serious or not.</p><p>\u201cAnd I never got an apology for it.\u201d</p><p>There it was. The blond shook his head, chuckling. \u201cSeriously, Tony. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. You too.\u201d He cleared his throat. \u201cKid said you\u2019re taking the stones in the morning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. That\u2019s the plan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. No reason to screw with time any more than we have. Maybe that\u2019ll help set it straight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe hope so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve probably messed with time enough,\u201d Tony said softly, but his gaze flickered up, catching Steve\u2019s. \u201cNo regrets though. I think we did good, all things considered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe did. Listen, Tony -\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Daddy</i>!\u201d</p><p>The squeal from the door drew both men\u2019s attention and Morgan Stark bounded into the room, her mother right behind her. \u201cRemember what I said. Gentle.\u201d</p><p>The little girl slowed down by the bed, but didn\u2019t stop. She was just careful as she climbed up. \u201cI knew you\u2019d wake up,\u201d she told him and Tony\u2019s smile was soft.</p><p>\u201cYeah? You tell them all that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cC'mere,\u201d he prompted and she instantly snuggled down against him, burrowed into his uninjured shoulder and holding on tight. Tony looked back up to Steve. \u201cI\u2019ll see you when you get back, yeah? Try not to get lost. We need you.\u201d</p><p>The words hit hard, the meaning even harder. The forgiveness was stretching on past necessity. Tony was choosing it, not just resigning to it. Steve offered him a smile. \u201cI\u2019ll be back before you know it,\u201d he promised and turned to leave his friend with his family gathering around him. He would be okay. He might never be made physically whole again, but he\u2019d be okay. After being willing to fall on the grenade for them, he deserved that much at the very least. Now it was Steve\u2019s job to make sure that others didn\u2019t suffer because of what they had had to do.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0____________<br></p><p>TBC</p><p><b>Notes</b>: I have been trying to tell this plot bunny no for too long and it just wouldn\u2019t listen, so here we go.</p><p><b>Next time</b>: Steve\u2019s trip does not go as planned for anyone involved.</p>",

His breath caught at his daughter&rsquo;s name and his jaw clenched, trying to keep some semblance of composure. He hadn&rsquo;t had a chance to say goodbye to her. Not really. He&rsquo;d left a video in case the worst happened, but it wasn&rsquo;t the same. He&rsquo;d never see her again. Never be able to hold her and tease her.

I took it.&rdquo; He tosses the dice down.</p><p>&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s it?&rdquo;</p><p>Tony looked up at him as the dice settled out in the board, not bothering to look down. &ldquo;What'dya mean?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I seem to remember a stubborn streak in you. One that wouldn&rsquo;t give up so easily.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not really my call anymore, is it?&rdquo;</p><p>Dark eyes flickered down to the board. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p><p>Tony followed his gaze down to the dice to see the winning roll. His lips quirked up, but the snarky comment died on them at the kind smile Yinsen wore. The younger man blinked hard in question, but as he opened his eyes he found himself in a completely different setting.</p><p>He was flat on his back and staring at a ceiling directly above him. The lights were too bright, the sound of the machinery deafening, and he couldn&rsquo;t breathe. He tried to reach up to his throat, but found his right arm unresponsive and his left tethered to&hellip;. something. He wasn&rsquo;t sure what yet. Every last thought was consumed with the understanding that he was <i>choking</i> and he needed to make it stop.</p><p>Another alarm sounded as Tony tugged harder against whatever was tying him down, fingers finding something long and smooth inserted into his mouth and supposedly running down his throat. Getting it out was the next goal.</p><p>He could hear shouting in the distance and his name broke through the gaze of it. <i>Mr Stark</i> was followed by <i>Tony</i>. That voice. That voice he knew.</p><p>Pepper didn&rsquo;t seem to care what the people around her were telling her to do. She pushed past a man in a white coat and Tony felt her hand catch his as she came into his line of vision. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay. Tony, babe, it&rsquo;s okay. Just breathe.&rdquo;</p><p>He couldn&rsquo;t. That was the problem. There was something&hellip;. he tried to reach for his throat again, but she wouldn&rsquo;t let go. Instead she pulled his hand up, pressing a kiss to his fingers. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a breathing tube, Tony. You&rsquo;re okay. It&rsquo;s there to help.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ma'am, we need to-&rdquo;</p><p>She shot the owner of the voice a glare that silenced him instantly, her expression softening as it turned back to him. &ldquo;Hey. Look at me.&rdquo; He did, feeling some of the panic subside. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re in the hospital. We made it. You&rsquo;re okay. You&rsquo;re going to be okay.&rdquo;</p><p>Tears stood in her eyes, but her smile wasn&rsquo;t forced. It was relieved, and slowly the pieces started to fit into place. He was alive. If Yinsen had been there or not, he couldn&rsquo;t be sure, but somehow he had managed to hang on until they had gotten him help. He tried to whisper her name, but only managed to choke against the tube again and she squeezed his hand. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be right here when you wake up,&rdquo; she promised and moved so that he could see a doctor pushing medication into the IV. It didn&rsquo;t take long until he felt himself slipping back under.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ____________</p><p>They hadn&rsquo;t been able to tell her when or even if he would wake up. Pepper had ushered Peter out of the room for a much needed cup of coffee ten minutes before, knowing that if she didn&rsquo;t make the kid stretch his legs he would sit there all evening with her. It had become their ritual over the last two weeks: he would get off of school and immediately hop the train from Queens to Manhattan. A few days she was pretty sure he showed up before the school day should have ended, but she couldn&rsquo;t bring herself to chastise him over it. Peter would sit with Tony while Pepper would take Morgan for dinner and connect with Happy or Rhodey so that one of them could take her for a bit so that she could return to the hospital room. It wasn&rsquo;t like she was going to go home and sleep in her own bed anyway. That&rsquo;s when Peter was expected to head home, but he rarely did. There had been several nights that he&rsquo;d fallen asleep in the chair and wouldn&rsquo;t budge. Pepper tried to get him moving when she could bring herself to do it, but she understood. She didn&rsquo;t want to leave him either.</p><p>And the one time she had he had woken up in a panic, fighting the tube down his throat and nearly hurting himself. Pepper shook her head as she stepped out into the hall where she&rsquo;d left the kid. Leave it to Tony to wake up with a bang.</p><p>Steve Rogers stood with him, but Peter&rsquo;s attention tore over to her instantly and he stood. &ldquo;Is he okay? Is he-?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s alright,&rdquo; she assured him quickly, offering Steve a quick nod to greet him. &ldquo;The doctors needed to sedate him to get the tube out and check on him. They said he&rsquo;ll be in and out, but we should be able to see him as soon as they&rsquo;re done.&rdquo;</p><p>She could see the relief flood through him in the way the tension left his shoulders and they sagged, the weight of the last couple weeks leaving the teenager looking as tired as Pepper felt. &ldquo;Good. That&rsquo;s good, right? So he&rsquo;s out of the woods? Dr Palmer said him waking up would be a good sign, right? So he&rsquo;ll be okay?&rdquo;</p><p>Even exhausted, his energy was overwhelming. &ldquo;Yes, she seemed to think so. Steve, how are things going on your end?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I think we&rsquo;ve got everything in place,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;Bruce is running some last minute tests on it this evening. Or was. He&rsquo;s on his way over now.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not thinking of going himself, is he?&rdquo; Pepper asked. She knew he felt responsible for returning the stones, but between his own injuries and the fact that he&rsquo;d been instrumental in saving Tony&rsquo;s life with his research into gamma radiation, she didn&rsquo;t want to think about the possibility of losing him in this. Ten seconds on their end, from what she understood, but what if something went wrong? They needed him. Tony needed him. He was awake, but that was really only the start on the road to recovery.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, no. He&rsquo;s staying here. I&rsquo;m taking them. First thing in the morning if everything stays on course. That&rsquo;s why I wanted to&hellip;&rdquo; Blue eyes darted past her and she couldn&rsquo;t help but think of the strained relationship that he had had with her husband the last handful of years. They&rsquo;d put it behind them to finish this, but she could see why he might question what that meant now that it was over. No one held a grudge quite like Tony Stark, but no one forgave like him either.</p><p>Pepper reached out, her light touch pulling him around. &ldquo;If you have a little bit, I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;d love to see you.&rdquo;</p><p>He flashed her a hesitant smile. &ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo;</p><p>Several of the medical staff filed out of the room and a doctor stopped. &ldquo;Ms Stark? He&rsquo;s coming back around if you wanted to-&rdquo;</p><p>Peter was nearly a blur as he bounded towards the door, slamming to a stop before he crossed the threshold. &ldquo;I, uh&hellip;.. you should probably see him first,&rdquo; he said awkwardly.</p><p>&ldquo;How about together?&rdquo; she offered and his face lit up.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wait out here until you&rsquo;ve had some time with him,&rdquo; Steve offered and Pepper managed a grateful smile as they ducked in.</p><p>The doctor followed her as Peter moved towards his mentor with as much restraint as he seemed able to cobble together. Pepper watched Tony&rsquo;s lips twitch up on the left side, the burns on the right side of his face making it difficult for him to smile fully. The doctor at her side spoke quietly, explains that Dr Palmer would want to do a more thorough examination as soon as she was in, but his vitals looked as good as could be expected. As they had anticipated, he had very little movement in his right arm and the burns that stretched down his right side would hinder mobility. Physical therapy would be required to get any sort of movement back and they had already sent Dr Banner the newest set of information so that he could adjust his own treatments that he&rsquo;d prescribed that had kept Tony alive.</p><p>Pepper half listened, but found her attention tapering off to the excited teenager that was telling Tony some story with a full range of motions, hands flying and he was bouncing just a little. He didn&rsquo;t stop until Tony reached his left hand up, clumsily reaching for him. The dam seemed to break as the teen took it and tears started to spill over. &ldquo;I was so scared, Mr Stark.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ms Stark?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; Pepper answered automatically.</p><p>&ldquo;Is there anything else?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, thank you. For everything.&rdquo; She waited until he was gone and steeled herself. Tony already had one blubbering person leaned over him. She&rsquo;d be damned if she made it two.</p><p>Poise carefully back in place she crossed the room and found a set of dark eyes on her. &ldquo;Hey, Pep,&rdquo; he greeted hoarsely and her poise shattered cracked instantly. Peter had the good sense to move out of her way as she circled around and took his outreached hand. &ldquo;Those tears aren&rsquo;t for me, are they?&rdquo;</p><p>The laugh escaped and she leaned down, pressing a kiss to the side of his mouth. &ldquo;I thought we&rsquo;d lost you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Too much to come home to,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;You okay?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Morgan?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s with Happy. They&rsquo;re on their way.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony gave the smallest of nods. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t wait to see her.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;ll be plenty of time.&rdquo; She glanced back at the door. &ldquo;Steve&rsquo;s here.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Cap?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Huh.&rdquo; The sound was quiet and he seemed to be settling back into the pillows a little deeper.</p><p>Pepper&rsquo;s phone buzzed, signaling Happy&rsquo;s arrival. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to go get Morgan. You want me to send him in?&rdquo;</p><p>Tony gave the barest of mods and she caught Peter by the jacket sleeve. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you come help me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What? You don&rsquo;t need me to-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Give them a moment,&rdquo; she pressed and Peter seemed to clue in and nodded, following her out of the room.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;____________<br /></p><p>Steve lingered at the door, blue gaze fixed on what looked like a sleeping man inside. Not for the first time he was struck at how many similarities there were between Tony and his father, even now that Tony was a good twenty-five years older than Howard had been when Steve had first met him. Stubborn, brilliant, and oftentimes reckless, it was hard not to care about the man, even when he drove him up the wall.</p><p>A pair of brown eyes very similar to Howard&rsquo;s cracked open and Tony offered a small wave. &ldquo;Cap.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hey,&rdquo; the older man greeted as he crossed the space. &ldquo;How&rsquo;re you feeling?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;d say I&rsquo;ve been worse, but I outdid myself this time.&rdquo; The rough chuckle ended with a cough and a wince. &ldquo;Rumour is that I&rsquo;ll live.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You better. Not sure the world could survive without you.&rdquo;</p><p>That earned him an amused snort. &ldquo;Better stop playing hero, huh?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I said that a long time ago,&rdquo; Steve countered, not sure if Tony was being serious or not.</p><p>&ldquo;And I never got an apology for it.&rdquo;</p><p>There it was. The blond shook his head, chuckling. &ldquo;Seriously, Tony. I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;re okay.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks. You too.&rdquo; He cleared his throat. &ldquo;Kid said you&rsquo;re taking the stones in the morning?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah. That&rsquo;s the plan.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Good. No reason to screw with time any more than we have. Maybe that&rsquo;ll help set it straight.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We hope so.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve probably messed with time enough,&rdquo; Tony said softly, but his gaze flickered up, catching Steve&rsquo;s. &ldquo;No regrets though. I think we did good, all things considered.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We did. Listen, Tony -&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Daddy</i>!&rdquo;</p><p>The squeal from the door drew both men&rsquo;s attention and Morgan Stark bounded into the room, her mother right behind her. &ldquo;Remember what I said. Gentle.&rdquo;</p><p>The little girl slowed down by the bed, but didn&rsquo;t stop. She was just careful as she climbed up. &ldquo;I knew you&rsquo;d wake up,&rdquo; she told him and Tony&rsquo;s smile was soft.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah? You tell them all that?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;C'mere,&rdquo; he prompted and she instantly snuggled down against him, burrowed into his uninjured shoulder and holding on tight. Tony looked back up to Steve. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see you when you get back, yeah? Try not to get lost. We need you.&rdquo;</p><p>The words hit hard, the meaning even harder. The forgiveness was stretching on past necessity. Tony was choosing it, not just resigning to it. Steve offered him a smile. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be back before you know it,&rdquo; he promised and turned to leave his friend with his family gathering around him. He would be okay. He might never be made physically whole again, but he&rsquo;d be okay. After being willing to fall on the grenade for them, he deserved that much at the very least. Now it was Steve&rsquo;s job to make sure that others didn&rsquo;t suffer because of what they had had to do.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;____________<br /></p><p>TBC</p><p><b>Notes</b>: I have been trying to tell this plot bunny no for too long and it just wouldn&rsquo;t listen, so here we go.</p><p><b>Next time</b>: Steve&rsquo;s trip does not go as planned for anyone involved.</p>",

His problems start when he makes an impulse decision to jump over to 1946 and Peggy decides to go back home with him. It only gets more complicated from there when Howard tags along with them to 2023.</p>\n<h2><b>Chapter One</b></h2>\n<p>He wasn&rsquo;t sure what he&rsquo;d expected or if he&rsquo;d expected anything at all really. He hadn&rsquo;t had time to think about it as he&rsquo;d stared down his own living nightmare that threatened everyone and everything that he loved. A cheap trick and a cheesy one liner&hellip; funny thing, it really did sum him up in the end.</p>\n<p>As the world faded away, Pepper&rsquo;s forced smile the last thing Tony saw, something else he couldn&rsquo;t quite make out started to take its place. Apparently this is what death was. Good to know. Maybe he&rsquo;d see Nat. Get a chance to tell her they won and that the others were safe. Or maybe he&rsquo;d see his parents. There was a lot he&rsquo;d like to say to his father, and none of it what he would have said just a few years before. He loved him. He knew he&rsquo;d done his best. It had been cathartic a few years ago to say those words in a simulation, but after meeting him in the past he thought he believed it now. He wanted to believe it now. Maybe his father would actually be proud of what his son had become.</p>\n<p>The face that greeted him wasn&rsquo;t his fathers. It wasn&rsquo;t his mother or Natasha&rsquo;s. That quiet, knowing smile reached his eyes in a way Tony had never seen in life, and he felt himself echo it just a little. &ldquo;Yinsen.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The older man nodded over to a table with a backgammon board laid out, two barrels like the ones they had sat on in the cave so many years before set up for them. Tony wasn&rsquo;t sure if it had been there a moment before but, to be fair, he wasn&rsquo;t even really sure where he was.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;A middle ground of a sort,&rdquo; Yinsen answered the unspoken question and took a seat.</p>\n<p>Tony followed, sitting opposite of him and watching him carefully. &ldquo;Like Purgatory?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Not quite.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Well that wasn&rsquo;t helpful. He let his gaze sweep the space as Yinsen set the board. As far as he could see they were the only ones there.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Stark.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>He turned back, startled by the tone that sounded like he had called his name a couple times before he had actually heard it, and saw the set of offered dice in Yinsen&rsquo;s outstretched hand. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t get it.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The older man lifted a single brow in an amused expression. &ldquo;I seem to remember you having a good grasp on the rules of the game.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I mean why I&rsquo;m here.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;To play. And to talk. I have missed out talks, Stark.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Tony swallowed hard, finally taking the dice and rolling. 6-3. Not bad. &ldquo;Me too,&rdquo; he confessed softly as Yinsen picked them up. &ldquo;A lot&rsquo;s happened.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I know.&rdquo; He rolled, landing only one point lower. &ldquo;Tell me.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Tell you what?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Everything. We have time.&rdquo;</p>\n</p>",

Delivered by the master of snark and quippy nicknames himself.</p><p>&ldquo;And lately,\nit&rsquo;s been Wanda and Strange, all the time. They can barely stand each other&rsquo;s\npresence,&rdquo; his mentor grumbled. &ldquo;How are they going to ever learn to\ncooperate, when every meeting ends up in a screaming match or worse, I don&rsquo;t\nknow. Someone has to make this kindergarten work and it&rsquo;s not going to be <i>me</i>.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then\nwho?&rdquo; Peter asked, fuzzily bemused. &ldquo;I mean&hellip; someone has to, right?\nThey can&rsquo;t go on&hellip; like this? And I mean, why does doctor Stephen argue with\nher?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Because he\ndoes not, quote, proscribe to the belief that there is anything of value to be\ngained by listening to an amateur trying to school him in his job, end\nquote.&rdquo;</p><p>He frowned.</p><p>&ldquo;And that\nmeans?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That our\nSorcerer Supreme is not going to listen to some small-town witch with delusions\nof grandeur - again, a quote - and that our local occult practitioner is not\ngoing to talk to the stuck-up stick-in-the-mud again, because why bother.\nAnother quote. Then she started muttering in Russian and that always makes me\nuneasy.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter smothered a\nsmile.</p><p>&ldquo;And what did\nshe want to teach him about?&rdquo;</p><p>Mr Stark looked up\nfrom over his Stark Pad and just rolled his eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;Magic. I\nmean, I&rsquo;m not even trying to get into details. She <i>is</i> powered by the Mind Stone and he uses Time Stone, so I thought\nthey would be at least more or less in the same book, if the same page is not\non the table, but it seems their, well, brands of magic are utterly\nincompatible and each approaches the ideas of power manipulation from a\ncompletely different angle. Whatever. Not going to meddle with them.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Which of them\nis subtle and which would be prone to anger&hellip;?&rdquo; Peter managed a weak\njoke, getting a small laugh out of Mr Stark.</p><p>Everything, in\ngeneral, had been weak in the weeks he had spent in Shuri&rsquo;s &ldquo;hospital\nwing&rdquo;. First, waking up to total darkness, hearing the nearly damning\ndiagnosis of large-scale nerve damage, about the spinal injury, about the optic\nnerve&hellip; and then slow, slow recuperation&hellip; Until the moment like this very\none, like now, when, if he didn&rsquo;t know better, if he didn&rsquo;t know what will come\nlater, he could have said he was, actually, quite fine. Acceptably well.</p><p>But he wasn&rsquo;t. Not\nat all.</p><p>It wasn&rsquo;t helping\nthat his surroundings and the obvious amount of money going into the machinery\ndedicated to his wellbeing were, to say it delicately, daunting. For a kid like\nhim, a scholarship student in an acceptably reasonable high school, a\u2014 well,\nnot-really-a-superhero (unlike other superheroes, he didn&rsquo;t have a seemingly\nunlimited budget, just a really, really kind benefactor looking after him),\nwell, for such a kid, being housed in a foreign embassy was by itself something\nquite out of the everyday. To add to it the array of monitors, support and all\nthese weird little instruments that both Shuri and doctor Stephen had used, and\nthe procedures he was undergoing&hellip;</p><p>He didn&rsquo;t want to\nimagine the bill for this all.</p><p>It made him <i>antsy</i> and left him with a strong\nyearning for at least a modicum of normality. A public hospital would be a good\nstart. Maybe.</p><p>He knew quite well\nthat there were people out there looking for him and that it wasn&rsquo;t <i>safe</i> in a normal hospital \u2014 and that was\nnot only <i>not safe</i> for him, but for\ndoctor Stephen, for Mr Stark and for Shuri. Well, and it would have been hard\nto be in any normal hospital and receive this kind of treatment, starting from\nShuri&rsquo;s neural repair lasers, to doctor Stephen&rsquo;s magical healing, to the\nsupercharged IV that delivered a triple normal dose of sugars and microelements\nhis body needed.</p><p>And it would have\nbeen very much unsafe for Mr Stark to visit him, judging from the kinds of news\nFriday had been reading to him.</p><p>He looked longingly\nat the Stark Pad his mentor was holding, but then his eyes dropped to his own,\nstill heavily wrapped hands and he sighed, easing down on the pillows.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, Peter&hellip;\nyou OK? This last site, it doesn&rsquo;t hurt anymore, right?&rdquo;</p><p>He shrugged\nnon-committally. </p><p>&ldquo;Not\nreally,&rdquo; he mumbled a small lie. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just, I don&rsquo;t have a lot to\ndo. And it&rsquo;s hard to do the research with Friday when I can&rsquo;t see, you know,\nthe schematics. And anyway I didn&rsquo;t want to disturb you, and it usually\ninvolves a lot of talking and Fri repeating big pieces to me, because I don&rsquo;t\nreally work all that well without any visual help\u2014&rdquo;</p><p>A mumbled &lsquo;shit&rsquo;\nfrom his side and a flurry of motion surprised him.</p><p>And so did the\ndouble-sized Stark Pad dropped into his lap.</p><p>&ldquo;New model,\nnot yet on the market,&rdquo; Mr Stark explained hastily. &ldquo;I was supposed\nto give it to you, but what with the arguments and living space arrangements\nand with Stephen clashing with Wanda and then with Shuri, I kind of forgot I\nhad it&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>They both grimaced.</p><p>Doctor Stephen had\nindeed argued with Shuri about the speed at which Peter&rsquo;s treatments were applied.\nHe was very much for slowing down and making the changes more gradually, while\nShuri was pressing for as many grafts, nerve growths and whatever-elses as was\nphysically possible.</p><p>Sometimes Peter\nsided with her, as he wanted this whole thing to be Just Simply Done. It was\nemotionally exhausting to stay in bed, away from home and May and his friends.\nHe wanted to be out, to be doing things. To see with his own eyes that they\nwere all, in fact, alive and well - which he couldn&rsquo;t do right now, because,\nwell, security.</p><p>On the other hand,\ndoctor Stephen&rsquo;s arguments for taking it slow had some merit. His approach\nmeant less pain at the same time, fewer places on Peter&rsquo;s body that needed dressings,\nless stress on his body.</p><p>And, he shamefully\nhad to admit, it meant more time spent with Mr Stark, who seemed to be there\nafter each subsequent treatment, only occasionally replaced by his wife.</p><p>When he thought of\nthis, it was strange, that weird combined guardianship. Between doctor Stephen\nand the adults who felt responsible for his wellbeing, he found himself\u2014 taken\ncare of to the degree he hadn&rsquo;t experienced even when Uncle Ben was still\nalive. It felt, well, luxurious.</p><p>May came by in the\nmornings, before her afternoon shifts, and sat with him, talking quietly about\nthings that were happening in the neighbourhood and in the city, very carefully\nomitting any kind of sensational news that might &ldquo;disturb&rdquo; him. </p><p>Mr Stark visited,\non average, two out of every three days \u2014 calling every time he had to be\nsomewhere else \u2014 and gave him a background of a variety of the Avengers&rsquo;\nactivities \u2014 a complete and quite extensive lowdown on everything that was\nhappening both in the Tower and at the Compound. The missions. The training.\nThe arguments, the gossip and the practical jokes. It made Peter feel at the\nsame time included - by Mr Stark, who obviously shared all this in the spirit\nof 'you should know what these dumbasses are doing&rsquo; - and isolated, being\nunable to join said dumbasses any time soon.</p><p>Mrs Stark \u2014 who\noccasionally reminded him to call her 'Pepper&rsquo; (he was still resisting) \u2014\ntalked to him about books. Of all things, Pepper Potts-Stark turned out to be a\ncloseted fan of the good, old, traditional hard fantasy of all kinds, from\nTolkien up. She was the one who added her collection of audiobooks to Friday&rsquo;s\n&ldquo;family&rdquo; library section, allowing Peter to listen to both the\nclassics and the new things, written in the time Between.</p><p>And now, oh, now he\nwould have access to <i>everything</i>. He\nwouldn&rsquo;t need Friday to repeat things to him over and over - he would see them\nand <i>remember</i> properly. That would be\nglorious&hellip;!</p><p>He moved to adjust\nthe angle of the screen, but the pad started slipping and his bandaged hands\nwere quite useless in keeping it where it was supposed to be. He tried not to\ndraw any more attention to it, but apparently had made some kind of noise of\ndistress, as immediately his back was being supported and brought up to a\ncomfortable angle, the pad was secured in his lap with the help of a small\nlunch tray and there was an additional pillow supporting his head.</p><p>Mr Stark patted his\nshoulder as he finished by pulling the cover higher up and tucking it around\nPeter&rsquo;s torso. Seriously. It had the potential to become very, very annoying&hellip;\nBut&hellip; Was it so bad that he wanted more of this? Wished for someone to take\ncare of him like that? Like May used to do when he was a little kid and got\nsick every fall \u2014 sitting with him, reading to him, holding him when his\ntemperature went high and stayed there. He didn&rsquo;t want to be <i>sick</i> as such, but somehow being taken\ncare of held an enormous appeal in his eyes.</p><p>But it wasn&rsquo;t\nsomething he could admit, was it?</p><p>Nope. Not to his\nmentor, not to his aunt and not to the CEO of the company that was apparently\ncounting him as one of their employees.</p><p>And most definitely\nnot to a wizard.</p><p>Because. Let&rsquo;s be\nserious.</p><p>Nope.</p><p>&ldquo;Friday, turn\nthe pad on,&rdquo; Mr Stark said softly. &ldquo;And tie the access to Peter&rsquo;s\nvoice pattern.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, boss.\nDone,&rdquo; the AI answered - probably in both links they were wearing,\n&ldquo;Peter, do you want to set up some basic commands that you could use as\nlong as your hands are wrapped?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hm&hellip; A nod\nto scroll down, up for up and clicking links on voice command?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;There is also\na bit of interface that interprets eye movements. You can set it up so that you\nonly have to look at the needed link and blink,&rdquo; his mentor suggested.\n&ldquo;This system is being prepared for various kinds of&hellip; communication\nproblems. For you and some percentage of people, it&rsquo;s just a case of temporary\ndiscomfort, but there is a huge group of accident victims and folks after\nserious illnesses who need this kind of interface on daily basis, probably for\nthe rest of their lives.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh,\nright,&rdquo; Peter grimaced.</p><p>Oh, right, indeed.</p><p>He wasn&rsquo;t going to\ngo into any details though. He wasn&rsquo;t going to suddenly share with his mentor\nall these nights when he woke up from dreams of being completely immobilised,\nweeks when, upon awakening, he checked his arms and legs - shaky, but there,\nuncertain, but still feeling - and touched each finger in an attempt at\ncontrolling the way his brain was screaming to him that he had lost them, <i>lost them</i>, lost the feeling, lost, lost,\nlost&hellip;</p><p>&ldquo;Pete? Pete,\nkid, where did you go?&rdquo;</p><p>He shook himself\noff and tried to smile at Mr Stark, but it must have come across more as\n'sickly&rsquo; than as 'reassuring&rsquo; because he found himself under the close scrutiny\nof his mentor.</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong,\nkiddo?&rdquo;</p><p>Peter took a shuddering\nbreath and relaxed into the pillows slightly.</p><p>&ldquo;Just, bad\ndreams. I remembered something.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Mhm. You know\nyou can tell me if this becomes too much, right? I can tell both Stephen and\nShuri to back off and give you longer breaks between treatments, so you can\nrelax and&hellip; you know. Convince your body you can be off your guard more often\nthan not.&rdquo;</p><p>Oh, yeah. That.</p><p>Embarrassing.</p><p>Because\nMr Stark had been correct.</p><p>Precisely\nright on the bloody dot.</p><p>He\nhad guessed - intuited, deduced - that Peter had been sustaining his most\nwatchful and stressed mode of operation every second since he awoke from his\ncoma. Sheer stress and uncertainty of the situation had not allowed the\nspidey-senses to calm down, even in his sleep. Every stimulus made them go into\noverdrive, his ears catching even the drip of the leaky faucet in the bathroom\na floor above the hospital enclosure. Not to mention the general activity of\nway too many people in a limited space. Rationally, he knew that there were\nmuch fewer people in the Embassy than in his building in Queens, but his\nfeelings had been veritably screaming, warning him of continued danger, danger\nfrom everywhere around him&hellip;!</p><p>Every\ntime one of his sensors calmed down, another picked up the baton - smell of\nhospital disinfectant attacked him when everything quieted at nighttime, then,\nonce the air exchange system kicked in and removed the chemical odour, his\nbrain served him with an attack of restless legs, which was rather annoying,\nconsidering he could barely <i>move</i>\nthese legs.</p><p>But\nthe worst part? He hadn&rsquo;t known what was wrong. Why everyone seemed to stink or\nshout or pinch him. Why every breeze from the window made him shiver down to\nhis bones. Why even the little hairs on his hands <i>hurt</i> every time they raised.</p><p>Only\nwhen Mr Stark called and plainly asked him about the chances of him running\nhimself ragged by sustaining the fighting mode for so long, he started noticing\nthings. Things that should not have happened, had he &ldquo;powered down&rdquo;\nthe spider. At least, thankfully, he hadn&rsquo;t started to stick to anything - but\non the other hand, this would have been a plain hint at what was going on with\nhim&hellip;!</p><p>But,\nwhen he tried to let go and relax, he found out he couldn&rsquo;t.</p><p>And\nthen Mr Stark came and talked him down.</p><p>That\nhad been humiliating.</p><p>Like\na toddler who screams his throat raw because he doesn&rsquo;t want to go to daycare,\nPeter had to be calmed down, from - what he saw now - a shivering, permanently\nalert wreck, into something resembling normal state.</p><p>Normal\nstate included seeing in normal light without feeling as if someone was\nstabbing his brain with knitting needles. As doctor Stephen explained it, the\nenhanced state was inducing additional activity on the side of his rod cells,\nand since his change, the density of said rods on his retina was apparently\nseven times the standard human norm. This made for very good night vision and\npotentially killing headaches if he didn&rsquo;t learn to cover his eyes in time. Or\nto power the whole thing down.</p><p>Mr\nStark had held him, breathed with him, talked him through several attempts at\ngetting himself under control and in general <i>been there</i>, with him, for long hours, until that primitive,\nprotective part of Peter&rsquo;s brain caught on to the fact that he was actually <i>safe</i>, dammit, and laid off flooding his\nsystem with adrenaline. It was such a relief when it stopped that it was nearly\npainful in itself. </p><p>And\nthen, the next day, he was given was the best gift anyone had ever gotten him.\nHe could have hugged Mr Stark - if not for the fact that he was stuck in bed\nwith an IV in each arm and the man was helping him to put on the glasses\ncorrectly. And they were a blessing. A simple application of his own solution\nfor filtering the light, copied from his suit, combined with the shielding\nprovided by Captain Danvers and what seemed to be a durable polymer of latest\ngeneration gave him a perfectly working pair of shades - with side blocks and\nadjustable strap, much more comfortable than the headband and much more useful.</p><p>And\nnow he had a pad - a <i>Stark Pad!</i> - and\nhis half-dim room and his mentor by his side and a project to work on.</p><p>&ldquo;Friday,\ncan you please bring up the file on photovoltaics?&rdquo; he asked quietly.\n&ldquo;And attach all the notes I added, even the ones made when I was kind of\nsleepy.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s\ncoming up, Peter. The notes are attached at the chronological points and by\nkeywords.&rdquo;</p><p>He\nlooked up at Mr Stark, who was watching him with a small frown.</p><p>&ldquo;Um.\nI had Friday read my notes back to me and she recorded all the remarks I made\non rereading. It&rsquo;s mostly small edits, but sometimes I had a new idea sparking\nkind of during the re-read&hellip;&rdquo; he trailed off, watching his mentor&rsquo;s\ncrestfallen face. &ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s\njust that&hellip;&rdquo; the man sighed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Peter. I should have\nthought about the pad earlier. But it&rsquo;s just been&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Too\nmany things at once, I know. I usually forgot about this too, since I&rsquo;ve gotten\nso used to this way of working when I was still, you know. And anyway, with my\nhands being still out of commission, I&rsquo;ll have to dictate any corrections I have.\nIt will be faster than the on-screen keyboard and blinking. This will be OK for\ncoding.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You\nare planning to code by\u2026 blinking?&rdquo;</p><p>Peter\ntried to call a semi-optimistic smile to his lips.</p><p>&ldquo;It\u2019s still better than NOT coding at all.\nAt least now I will have a written language reference to check against. Python\nis interesting and I have to catch up with five years of the language\ndevelopment, so\u2026&rdquo;</p><p>Mr\nStark was looking at him with something&hellip; something. Biting his lip.</p><p>&ldquo;OK.\nTell me about these photovoltaics.&rdquo;</p><p>There\nwas a bit of a wobble in that voice.</p><p>&ldquo;Well,\nsince doctor Stephen told me about the number of rods on my retina, I started\nthinking, what about using this for solar power&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Mr\nStark&rsquo;s pad had gone dark as he leaned in closer to have a look.</p><p>&ldquo;Go\non, kiddo. Tell me how you&rsquo;d do this.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So I was thinking\nabout this cell structure&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p><i>Tagging based on the interest in previous chapters, so if you don\u2019t want to be included, just let me know :)</i></p><p><i>(if someone wants to be included, I\u2019ll be more than happy to add them!)</i></p><p><i><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJomgQAmy08JhLoKD0xotvQ\" target=\"_blank\">@juni-berries</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJUF9-OuH82Ubc6_Jnje_BA\" target=\"_blank\">@bad-poetry-rants-and-fandoms</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mlNFARFgjS__4PgiS6zAhcw\" target=\"_blank\">@hpswl-cumbercookie</a> \u200b <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mUO_V5vLoYStzfXuSRokSnQ\" target=\"_blank\">@jessieblackwood</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mlGVOqcG1Vcf_e5W6drM7Cg\" target=\"_blank\">@aratinga4</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mZLl5TNp7GEIUBkV9jlI2Bg\" target=\"_blank\">@tmnt-leneah</a></i></p>",

And I mean, why does doctor Stephen argue with\nher?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he\ndoes not, quote, proscribe to the belief that there is anything of value to be\ngained by listening to an amateur trying to school him in his job, end\nquote.\u201d</p><p>He frowned.</p><p>\u201cAnd that\nmeans?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat our\nSorcerer Supreme is not going to listen to some small-town witch with delusions\nof grandeur - again, a quote - and that our local occult practitioner is not\ngoing to talk to the stuck-up stick-in-the-mud again, because why bother.\nAnother quote. Then she started muttering in Russian and that always makes me\nuneasy.\u201d</p><p>Peter smothered a\nsmile.</p><p>\u201cAnd what did\nshe want to teach him about?\u201d</p><p>Mr Stark looked up\nfrom over his Stark Pad and just rolled his eyes.</p><p>\u201cMagic. I\nmean, I\u2019m not even trying to get into details. She <i>is</i> powered by the Mind Stone and he uses Time Stone, so I thought\nthey would be at least more or less in the same book, if the same page is not\non the table, but it seems their, well, brands of magic are utterly\nincompatible and each approaches the ideas of power manipulation from a\ncompletely different angle. Whatever. Not going to meddle with them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich of them\nis subtle and which would be prone to anger\u2026?\u201d Peter managed a weak\njoke, getting a small laugh out of Mr Stark.</p><p>Everything, in\ngeneral, had been weak in the weeks he had spent in Shuri\u2019s \u201chospital\nwing\u201d. First, waking up to total darkness, hearing the nearly damning\ndiagnosis of large-scale nerve damage, about the spinal injury, about the optic\nnerve\u2026 and then slow, slow recuperation\u2026 Until the moment like this very\none, like now, when, if he didn\u2019t know better, if he didn\u2019t know what will come\nlater, he could have said he was, actually, quite fine. Acceptably well.</p><p>But he wasn\u2019t. Not\nat all.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t helping\nthat his surroundings and the obvious amount of money going into the machinery\ndedicated to his wellbeing were, to say it delicately, daunting. For a kid like\nhim, a scholarship student in an acceptably reasonable high school, a\u2014 well,\nnot-really-a-superhero (unlike other superheroes, he didn\u2019t have a seemingly\nunlimited budget, just a really, really kind benefactor looking after him),\nwell, for such a kid, being housed in a foreign embassy was by itself something\nquite out of the everyday. To add to it the array of monitors, support and all\nthese weird little instruments that both Shuri and doctor Stephen had used, and\nthe procedures he was undergoing\u2026</p><p>He didn\u2019t want to\nimagine the bill for this all.</p><p>It made him <i>antsy</i> and left him with a strong\nyearning for at least a modicum of normality. A public hospital would be a good\nstart. Maybe.</p><p>He knew quite well\nthat there were people out there looking for him and that it wasn\u2019t <i>safe</i> in a normal hospital \u2014 and that was\nnot only <i>not safe</i> for him, but for\ndoctor Stephen, for Mr Stark and for Shuri. Well, and it would have been hard\nto be in any normal hospital and receive this kind of treatment, starting from\nShuri\u2019s neural repair lasers, to doctor Stephen\u2019s magical healing, to the\nsupercharged IV that delivered a triple normal dose of sugars and microelements\nhis body needed.</p><p>And it would have\nbeen very much unsafe for Mr Stark to visit him, judging from the kinds of news\nFriday had been reading to him.</p><p>He looked longingly\nat the Stark Pad his mentor was holding, but then his eyes dropped to his own,\nstill heavily wrapped hands and he sighed, easing down on the pillows.</p><p>\u201cHey, Peter\u2026\nyou OK? This last site, it doesn\u2019t hurt anymore, right?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged\nnon-committally. </p><p>\u201cNot\nreally,\u201d he mumbled a small lie. \u201cIt\u2019s just, I don\u2019t have a lot to\ndo. And it\u2019s hard to do the research with Friday when I can\u2019t see, you know,\nthe schematics. And anyway I didn\u2019t want to disturb you, and it usually\ninvolves a lot of talking and Fri repeating big pieces to me, because I don\u2019t\nreally work all that well without any visual help\u2014\u201d</p><p>A mumbled \u2018shit\u2019\nfrom his side and a flurry of motion surprised him.</p><p>And so did the\ndouble-sized Stark Pad dropped into his lap.</p><p>\u201cNew model,\nnot yet on the market,\u201d Mr Stark explained hastily. \u201cI was supposed\nto give it to you, but what with the arguments and living space arrangements\nand with Stephen clashing with Wanda and then with Shuri, I kind of forgot I\nhad it\u2026\u201d</p><p>They both grimaced.</p><p>Doctor Stephen had\nindeed argued with Shuri about the speed at which Peter\u2019s treatments were applied.\nHe was very much for slowing down and making the changes more gradually, while\nShuri was pressing for as many grafts, nerve growths and whatever-elses as was\nphysically possible.</p><p>Sometimes Peter\nsided with her, as he wanted this whole thing to be Just Simply Done. It was\nemotionally exhausting to stay in bed, away from home and May and his friends.\nHe wanted to be out, to be doing things. To see with his own eyes that they\nwere all, in fact, alive and well - which he couldn\u2019t do right now, because,\nwell, security.</p><p>On the other hand,\ndoctor Stephen\u2019s arguments for taking it slow had some merit. His approach\nmeant less pain at the same time, fewer places on Peter\u2019s body that needed dressings,\nless stress on his body.</p><p>And, he shamefully\nhad to admit, it meant more time spent with Mr Stark, who seemed to be there\nafter each subsequent treatment, only occasionally replaced by his wife.</p><p>When he thought of\nthis, it was strange, that weird combined guardianship. Between doctor Stephen\nand the adults who felt responsible for his wellbeing, he found himself\u2014 taken\ncare of to the degree he hadn\u2019t experienced even when Uncle Ben was still\nalive. It felt, well, luxurious.</p><p>May came by in the\nmornings, before her afternoon shifts, and sat with him, talking quietly about\nthings that were happening in the neighbourhood and in the city, very carefully\nomitting any kind of sensational news that might \u201cdisturb\u201d him. </p><p>Mr Stark visited,\non average, two out of every three days \u2014 calling every time he had to be\nsomewhere else \u2014 and gave him a background of a variety of the Avengers\u2019\nactivities \u2014 a complete and quite extensive lowdown on everything that was\nhappening both in the Tower and at the Compound. The missions. The training.\nThe arguments, the gossip and the practical jokes. It made Peter feel at the\nsame time included - by Mr Stark, who obviously shared all this in the spirit\nof 'you should know what these dumbasses are doing\u2019 - and isolated, being\nunable to join said dumbasses any time soon.</p><p>Mrs Stark \u2014 who\noccasionally reminded him to call her 'Pepper\u2019 (he was still resisting) \u2014\ntalked to him about books. Of all things, Pepper Potts-Stark turned out to be a\ncloseted fan of the good, old, traditional hard fantasy of all kinds, from\nTolkien up. She was the one who added her collection of audiobooks to Friday\u2019s\n\u201cfamily\u201d library section, allowing Peter to listen to both the\nclassics and the new things, written in the time Between.</p><p>And now, oh, now he\nwould have access to <i>everything</i>. He\nwouldn\u2019t need Friday to repeat things to him over and over - he would see them\nand <i>remember</i> properly. That would be\nglorious\u2026!</p><p>He moved to adjust\nthe angle of the screen, but the pad started slipping and his bandaged hands\nwere quite useless in keeping it where it was supposed to be. He tried not to\ndraw any more attention to it, but apparently had made some kind of noise of\ndistress, as immediately his back was being supported and brought up to a\ncomfortable angle, the pad was secured in his lap with the help of a small\nlunch tray and there was an additional pillow supporting his head.</p><p>Mr Stark patted his\nshoulder as he finished by pulling the cover higher up and tucking it around\nPeter\u2019s torso. Seriously. It had the potential to become very, very annoying\u2026\nBut\u2026 Was it so bad that he wanted more of this? Wished for someone to take\ncare of him like that? Like May used to do when he was a little kid and got\nsick every fall \u2014 sitting with him, reading to him, holding him when his\ntemperature went high and stayed there. He didn\u2019t want to be <i>sick</i> as such, but somehow being taken\ncare of held an enormous appeal in his eyes.</p><p>But it wasn\u2019t\nsomething he could admit, was it?</p><p>Nope. Not to his\nmentor, not to his aunt and not to the CEO of the company that was apparently\ncounting him as one of their employees.</p><p>And most definitely\nnot to a wizard.</p><p>Because. Let\u2019s be\nserious.</p><p>Nope.</p><p>\u201cFriday, turn\nthe pad on,\u201d Mr Stark said softly. \u201cAnd tie the access to Peter\u2019s\nvoice pattern.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, boss.\nDone,\u201d the AI answered - probably in both links they were wearing,\n\u201cPeter, do you want to set up some basic commands that you could use as\nlong as your hands are wrapped?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHm\u2026 A nod\nto scroll down, up for up and clicking links on voice command?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is also\na bit of interface that interprets eye movements. You can set it up so that you\nonly have to look at the needed link and blink,\u201d his mentor suggested.\n\u201cThis system is being prepared for various kinds of\u2026 communication\nproblems. For you and some percentage of people, it\u2019s just a case of temporary\ndiscomfort, but there is a huge group of accident victims and folks after\nserious illnesses who need this kind of interface on daily basis, probably for\nthe rest of their lives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\nright,\u201d Peter grimaced.</p><p>Oh, right, indeed.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t going to\ngo into any details though. He wasn\u2019t going to suddenly share with his mentor\nall these nights when he woke up from dreams of being completely immobilised,\nweeks when, upon awakening, he checked his arms and legs - shaky, but there,\nuncertain, but still feeling - and touched each finger in an attempt at\ncontrolling the way his brain was screaming to him that he had lost them, <i>lost them</i>, lost the feeling, lost, lost,\nlost\u2026</p><p>\u201cPete? Pete,\nkid, where did you go?\u201d</p><p>He shook himself\noff and tried to smile at Mr Stark, but it must have come across more as\n'sickly\u2019 than as 'reassuring\u2019 because he found himself under the close scrutiny\nof his mentor.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong,\nkiddo?\u201d</p><p>Peter took a shuddering\nbreath and relaxed into the pillows slightly.</p><p>\u201cJust, bad\ndreams. I remembered something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMhm. You know\nyou can tell me if this becomes too much, right? I can tell both Stephen and\nShuri to back off and give you longer breaks between treatments, so you can\nrelax and\u2026 you know. Convince your body you can be off your guard more often\nthan not.\u201d</p><p>Oh, yeah. That.</p><p>Embarrassing.</p><p>Because\nMr Stark had been correct.</p><p>Precisely\nright on the bloody dot.</p><p>He\nhad guessed - intuited, deduced - that Peter had been sustaining his most\nwatchful and stressed mode of operation every second since he awoke from his\ncoma. Sheer stress and uncertainty of the situation had not allowed the\nspidey-senses to calm down, even in his sleep. Every stimulus made them go into\noverdrive, his ears catching even the drip of the leaky faucet in the bathroom\na floor above the hospital enclosure. Not to mention the general activity of\nway too many people in a limited space. Rationally, he knew that there were\nmuch fewer people in the Embassy than in his building in Queens, but his\nfeelings had been veritably screaming, warning him of continued danger, danger\nfrom everywhere around him\u2026!</p><p>Every\ntime one of his sensors calmed down, another picked up the baton - smell of\nhospital disinfectant attacked him when everything quieted at nighttime, then,\nonce the air exchange system kicked in and removed the chemical odour, his\nbrain served him with an attack of restless legs, which was rather annoying,\nconsidering he could barely <i>move</i>\nthese legs.</p><p>But\nthe worst part? He hadn\u2019t known what was wrong. Why everyone seemed to stink or\nshout or pinch him. Why every breeze from the window made him shiver down to\nhis bones. Why even the little hairs on his hands <i>hurt</i> every time they raised.</p><p>Only\nwhen Mr Stark called and plainly asked him about the chances of him running\nhimself ragged by sustaining the fighting mode for so long, he started noticing\nthings. Things that should not have happened, had he \u201cpowered down\u201d\nthe spider. At least, thankfully, he hadn\u2019t started to stick to anything - but\non the other hand, this would have been a plain hint at what was going on with\nhim\u2026!</p><p>But,\nwhen he tried to let go and relax, he found out he couldn\u2019t.</p><p>And\nthen Mr Stark came and talked him down.</p><p>That\nhad been humiliating.</p><p>Like\na toddler who screams his throat raw because he doesn\u2019t want to go to daycare,\nPeter had to be calmed down, from - what he saw now - a shivering, permanently\nalert wreck, into something resembling normal state.</p><p>Normal\nstate included seeing in normal light without feeling as if someone was\nstabbing his brain with knitting needles. As doctor Stephen explained it, the\nenhanced state was inducing additional activity on the side of his rod cells,\nand since his change, the density of said rods on his retina was apparently\nseven times the standard human norm. This made for very good night vision and\npotentially killing headaches if he didn\u2019t learn to cover his eyes in time. Or\nto power the whole thing down.</p><p>Mr\nStark had held him, breathed with him, talked him through several attempts at\ngetting himself under control and in general <i>been there</i>, with him, for long hours, until that primitive,\nprotective part of Peter\u2019s brain caught on to the fact that he was actually <i>safe</i>, dammit, and laid off flooding his\nsystem with adrenaline. It was such a relief when it stopped that it was nearly\npainful in itself. </p><p>And\nthen, the next day, he was given was the best gift anyone had ever gotten him.\nHe could have hugged Mr Stark - if not for the fact that he was stuck in bed\nwith an IV in each arm and the man was helping him to put on the glasses\ncorrectly. And they were a blessing. A simple application of his own solution\nfor filtering the light, copied from his suit, combined with the shielding\nprovided by Captain Danvers and what seemed to be a durable polymer of latest\ngeneration gave him a perfectly working pair of shades - with side blocks and\nadjustable strap, much more comfortable than the headband and much more useful.</p><p>And\nnow he had a pad - a <i>Stark Pad!</i> - and\nhis half-dim room and his mentor by his side and a project to work on.</p><p>\u201cFriday,\ncan you please bring up the file on photovoltaics?\u201d he asked quietly.\n\u201cAnd attach all the notes I added, even the ones made when I was kind of\nsleepy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s\ncoming up, Peter. The notes are attached at the chronological points and by\nkeywords.\u201d</p><p>He\nlooked up at Mr Stark, who was watching him with a small frown.</p><p>\u201cUm.\nI had Friday read my notes back to me and she recorded all the remarks I made\non rereading. It\u2019s mostly small edits, but sometimes I had a new idea sparking\nkind of during the re-read\u2026\u201d he trailed off, watching his mentor\u2019s\ncrestfallen face. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s\njust that\u2026\u201d the man sighed. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Peter. I should have\nthought about the pad earlier. But it\u2019s just been\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo\nmany things at once, I know. I usually forgot about this too, since I\u2019ve gotten\nso used to this way of working when I was still, you know. And anyway, with my\nhands being still out of commission, I\u2019ll have to dictate any corrections I have.\nIt will be faster than the on-screen keyboard and blinking. This will be OK for\ncoding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\nare planning to code by\u2026 blinking?\u201d</p><p>Peter\ntried to call a semi-optimistic smile to his lips.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s still better than NOT coding at all.\nAt least now I will have a written language reference to check against. Python\nis interesting and I have to catch up with five years of the language\ndevelopment, so\u2026\u201d</p><p>Mr\nStark was looking at him with something\u2026 something. Biting his lip.</p><p>\u201cOK.\nTell me about these photovoltaics.\u201d</p><p>There\nwas a bit of a wobble in that voice.</p><p>\u201cWell,\nsince doctor Stephen told me about the number of rods on my retina, I started\nthinking, what about using this for solar power\u2026\u201d</p><p>Mr\nStark\u2019s pad had gone dark as he leaned in closer to have a look.</p><p>\u201cGo\non, kiddo. Tell me how you\u2019d do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I was thinking\nabout this cell structure\u2026\u201d</p><p><i>Tagging based on the interest in previous chapters, so if you don\u2019t want to be included, just let me know :)</i></p><p><i>(if someone wants to be included, I\u2019ll be more than happy to add them!)</i></p><p><i><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJomgQAmy08JhLoKD0xotvQ\" target=\"_blank\">@juni-berries</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJUF9-OuH82Ubc6_Jnje_BA\" target=\"_blank\">@bad-poetry-rants-and-fandoms</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mlNFARFgjS__4PgiS6zAhcw\" target=\"_blank\">@hpswl-cumbercookie</a> \u200b <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mUO_V5vLoYStzfXuSRokSnQ\" target=\"_blank\">@jessieblackwood</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mlGVOqcG1Vcf_e5W6drM7Cg\" target=\"_blank\">@aratinga4</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mZLl5TNp7GEIUBkV9jlI2Bg\" target=\"_blank\">@tmnt-leneah</a></i></p>",

Unless he allowed himself to remember the\nmore idiotic things he did in the recent weeks, of course.</p>[[MORE]]<p>As most of the visits went, they were waiting for\nanother round of meds to arrive and Peter was exercising his fingers \u2014 bending them one\nby one, straightening again, making a fist \u2014 while Mr Stark kept a running\ncommentary about current events. Not from around the world, however, these\nPeter got from Friday \u2014 this, what Mr Stark was telling him right now, trying\nto distract him from the unpleasantness of yet another skin graft, was pure\nAvengers gossip.

First, waking up to total darkness, hearing the nearly damning\ndiagnosis of large-scale nerve damage, about the spinal injury, about the optic\nnerve\u2026 and then slow, slow recuperation\u2026 Until the moment like this very\none, like now, when, if he didn\u2019t know better, if he didn\u2019t know what will come\nlater, he could have said he was, actually, quite fine.

It was\nemotionally exhausting to stay in bed, away from home and May and his friends.\nHe wanted to be out, to be doing things.

Between doctor Stephen\nand the adults who felt responsible for his wellbeing, he found himself\u2014 taken\ncare of to the degree he hadn\u2019t experienced even when Uncle Ben was still\nalive. It felt, well, luxurious.</p><p>May came by in the\nmornings, before her afternoon shifts, and sat with him, talking quietly about\nthings that were happening in the neighbourhood and in the city, very carefully\nomitting any kind of sensational news that might \u201cdisturb\u201d him. </p><p>Mr Stark visited,\non average, two out of every three days \u2014 calling every time he had to be\nsomewhere else \u2014 and gave him a background of a variety of the Avengers\u2019\nactivities \u2014 a complete and quite extensive lowdown on everything that was\nhappening both in the Tower and at the Compound. The missions. The training.\nThe arguments, the gossip and the practical jokes. It made Peter feel at the\nsame time included - by Mr Stark, who obviously shared all this in the spirit\nof 'you should know what these dumbasses are doing\u2019 - and isolated, being\nunable to join said dumbasses any time soon.</p><p>Mrs Stark \u2014 who\noccasionally reminded him to call her 'Pepper\u2019 (he was still resisting) \u2014\ntalked to him about books. Of all things, Pepper Potts-Stark turned out to be a\ncloseted fan of the good, old, traditional hard fantasy of all kinds, from\nTolkien up. She was the one who added her collection of audiobooks to Friday\u2019s\n\u201cfamily\u201d library section, allowing Peter to listen to both the\nclassics and the new things, written in the time Between.</p><p>And now, oh, now he\nwould have access to <i>everything</i>. He\nwouldn\u2019t need Friday to repeat things to him over and over - he would see them\nand <i>remember</i> properly. That would be\nglorious\u2026!</p><p>He moved to adjust\nthe angle of the screen, but the pad started slipping and his bandaged hands\nwere quite useless in keeping it where it was supposed to be. He tried not to\ndraw any more attention to it, but apparently had made some kind of noise of\ndistress, as immediately his back was being supported and brought up to a\ncomfortable angle, the pad was secured in his lap with the help of a small\nlunch tray and there was an additional pillow supporting his head.</p><p>Mr Stark patted his\nshoulder as he finished by pulling the cover higher up and tucking it around\nPeter\u2019s torso. Seriously. It had the potential to become very, very annoying\u2026\nBut\u2026 Was it so bad that he wanted more of this? Wished for someone to take\ncare of him like that? Like May used to do when he was a little kid and got\nsick every fall \u2014 sitting with him, reading to him, holding him when his\ntemperature went high and stayed there. He didn\u2019t want to be <i>sick</i> as such, but somehow being taken\ncare of held an enormous appeal in his eyes.</p><p>But it wasn\u2019t\nsomething he could admit, was it?</p><p>Nope. Not to his\nmentor, not to his aunt and not to the CEO of the company that was apparently\ncounting him as one of their employees.</p><p>And most definitely\nnot to a wizard.</p><p>Because. Let\u2019s be\nserious.</p><p>Nope.</p><p>\u201cFriday, turn\nthe pad on,\u201d Mr Stark said softly. \u201cAnd tie the access to Peter\u2019s\nvoice pattern.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, boss.\nDone,\u201d the AI answered - probably in both links they were wearing,\n\u201cPeter, do you want to set up some basic commands that you could use as\nlong as your hands are wrapped?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHm\u2026 A nod\nto scroll down, up for up and clicking links on voice command?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is also\na bit of interface that interprets eye movements. You can set it up so that you\nonly have to look at the needed link and blink,\u201d his mentor suggested.\n\u201cThis system is being prepared for various kinds of\u2026 communication\nproblems. For you and some percentage of people, it\u2019s just a case of temporary\ndiscomfort, but there is a huge group of accident victims and folks after\nserious illnesses who need this kind of interface on daily basis, probably for\nthe rest of their lives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\nright,\u201d Peter grimaced.</p><p>Oh, right, indeed.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t going to\ngo into any details though. He wasn\u2019t going to suddenly share with his mentor\nall these nights when he woke up from dreams of being completely immobilised,\nweeks when, upon awakening, he checked his arms and legs - shaky, but there,\nuncertain, but still feeling - and touched each finger in an attempt at\ncontrolling the way his brain was screaming to him that he had lost them, <i>lost them</i>, lost the feeling, lost, lost,\nlost\u2026</p><p>\u201cPete? Pete,\nkid, where did you go?\u201d</p><p>He shook himself\noff and tried to smile at Mr Stark, but it must have come across more as\n'sickly\u2019 than as 'reassuring\u2019 because he found himself under the close scrutiny\nof his mentor.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong,\nkiddo?\u201d</p><p>Peter took a shuddering\nbreath and relaxed into the pillows slightly.</p><p>\u201cJust, bad\ndreams. I remembered something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMhm. You know\nyou can tell me if this becomes too much, right? I can tell both Stephen and\nShuri to back off and give you longer breaks between treatments, so you can\nrelax and\u2026 you know. Convince your body you can be off your guard more often\nthan not.\u201d</p><p>Oh, yeah. That.</p><p>Embarrassing.</p><p>Because\nMr Stark had been correct.</p><p>Precisely\nright on the bloody dot.</p><p>He\nhad guessed - intuited, deduced - that Peter had been sustaining his most\nwatchful and stressed mode of operation every second since he awoke from his\ncoma. Sheer stress and uncertainty of the situation had not allowed the\nspidey-senses to calm down, even in his sleep. Every stimulus made them go into\noverdrive, his ears catching even the drip of the leaky faucet in the bathroom\na floor above the hospital enclosure. Not to mention the general activity of\nway too many people in a limited space. Rationally, he knew that there were\nmuch fewer people in the Embassy than in his building in Queens, but his\nfeelings had been veritably screaming, warning him of continued danger, danger\nfrom everywhere around him\u2026!</p><p>Every\ntime one of his sensors calmed down, another picked up the baton - smell of\nhospital disinfectant attacked him when everything quieted at nighttime, then,\nonce the air exchange system kicked in and removed the chemical odour, his\nbrain served him with an attack of restless legs, which was rather annoying,\nconsidering he could barely <i>move</i>\nthese legs.</p><p>But\nthe worst part? He hadn\u2019t known what was wrong. Why everyone seemed to stink or\nshout or pinch him. Why every breeze from the window made him shiver down to\nhis bones. Why even the little hairs on his hands <i>hurt</i> every time they raised.</p><p>Only\nwhen Mr Stark called and plainly asked him about the chances of him running\nhimself ragged by sustaining the fighting mode for so long, he started noticing\nthings. Things that should not have happened, had he \u201cpowered down\u201d\nthe spider. At least, thankfully, he hadn\u2019t started to stick to anything - but\non the other hand, this would have been a plain hint at what was going on with\nhim\u2026!</p><p>But,\nwhen he tried to let go and relax, he found out he couldn\u2019t.</p><p>And\nthen Mr Stark came and talked him down.</p><p>That\nhad been humiliating.</p><p>Like\na toddler who screams his throat raw because he doesn\u2019t want to go to daycare,\nPeter had to be calmed down, from - what he saw now - a shivering, permanently\nalert wreck, into something resembling normal state.</p><p>Normal\nstate included seeing in normal light without feeling as if someone was\nstabbing his brain with knitting needles. As doctor Stephen explained it, the\nenhanced state was inducing additional activity on the side of his rod cells,\nand since his change, the density of said rods on his retina was apparently\nseven times the standard human norm. This made for very good night vision and\npotentially killing headaches if he didn\u2019t learn to cover his eyes in time. Or\nto power the whole thing down.</p><p>Mr\nStark had held him, breathed with him, talked him through several attempts at\ngetting himself under control and in general <i>been there</i>, with him, for long hours, until that primitive,\nprotective part of Peter\u2019s brain caught on to the fact that he was actually <i>safe</i>, dammit, and laid off flooding his\nsystem with adrenaline. It was such a relief when it stopped that it was nearly\npainful in itself. </p><p>And\nthen, the next day, he was given was the best gift anyone had ever gotten him.\nHe could have hugged Mr Stark - if not for the fact that he was stuck in bed\nwith an IV in each arm and the man was helping him to put on the glasses\ncorrectly. And they were a blessing. A simple application of his own solution\nfor filtering the light, copied from his suit, combined with the shielding\nprovided by Captain Danvers and what seemed to be a durable polymer of latest\ngeneration gave him a perfectly working pair of shades - with side blocks and\nadjustable strap, much more comfortable than the headband and much more useful.</p><p>And\nnow he had a pad - a <i>Stark Pad!</i> - and\nhis half-dim room and his mentor by his side and a project to work on.</p><p>\u201cFriday,\ncan you please bring up the file on photovoltaics?\u201d he asked quietly.\n\u201cAnd attach all the notes I added, even the ones made when I was kind of\nsleepy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s\ncoming up, Peter. The notes are attached at the chronological points and by\nkeywords.\u201d</p><p>He\nlooked up at Mr Stark, who was watching him with a small frown.</p><p>\u201cUm.\nI had Friday read my notes back to me and she recorded all the remarks I made\non rereading. It\u2019s mostly small edits, but sometimes I had a new idea sparking\nkind of during the re-read\u2026\u201d he trailed off, watching his mentor\u2019s\ncrestfallen face. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s\njust that\u2026\u201d the man sighed. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Peter. I should have\nthought about the pad earlier. But it\u2019s just been\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo\nmany things at once, I know. I usually forgot about this too, since I\u2019ve gotten\nso used to this way of working when I was still, you know. And anyway, with my\nhands being still out of commission, I\u2019ll have to dictate any corrections I have.\nIt will be faster than the on-screen keyboard and blinking. This will be OK for\ncoding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\nare planning to code by\u2026 blinking?\u201d</p><p>Peter\ntried to call a semi-optimistic smile to his lips.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s still better than NOT coding at all.\nAt least now I will have a written language reference to check against. Python\nis interesting and I have to catch up with five years of the language\ndevelopment, so\u2026\u201d</p><p>Mr\nStark was looking at him with something\u2026 something. Biting his lip.</p><p>\u201cOK.\nTell me about these photovoltaics.\u201d</p><p>There\nwas a bit of a wobble in that voice.</p><p>\u201cWell,\nsince doctor Stephen told me about the number of rods on my retina, I started\nthinking, what about using this for solar power\u2026\u201d</p><p>Mr\nStark\u2019s pad had gone dark as he leaned in closer to have a look.</p><p>\u201cGo\non, kiddo. Tell me how you\u2019d do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I was thinking\nabout this cell structure\u2026\u201d</p><p><i>Tagging based on the interest in previous chapters, so if you don\u2019t want to be included, just let me know :)</i></p><p><i>(if someone wants to be included, I\u2019ll be more than happy to add them!)</i></p><p><i><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJomgQAmy08JhLoKD0xotvQ\" target=\"_blank\">@juni-berries</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJUF9-OuH82Ubc6_Jnje_BA\" target=\"_blank\">@bad-poetry-rants-and-fandoms</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mlNFARFgjS__4PgiS6zAhcw\" target=\"_blank\">@hpswl-cumbercookie</a> \u200b <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mUO_V5vLoYStzfXuSRokSnQ\" target=\"_blank\">@jessieblackwood</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mlGVOqcG1Vcf_e5W6drM7Cg\" target=\"_blank\">@aratinga4</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mZLl5TNp7GEIUBkV9jlI2Bg\" target=\"_blank\">@tmnt-leneah</a></i></p>",

Not from around the world, however, these\nPeter got from Friday &mdash; this, what Mr Stark was telling him right now, trying\nto distract him from the unpleasantness of yet another skin graft, was pure\nAvengers gossip.

They can barely stand each other&rsquo;s\npresence,&rdquo; his mentor grumbled. &ldquo;How are they going to ever learn to\ncooperate, when every meeting ends up in a screaming match or worse, I don&rsquo;t\nknow.

It made Peter feel at the\nsame time included - by Mr Stark, who obviously shared all this in the spirit\nof 'you should know what these dumbasses are doing&rsquo; - and isolated, being\nunable to join said dumbasses any time soon.</p><p>Mrs Stark &mdash; who\noccasionally reminded him to call her 'Pepper&rsquo; (he was still resisting) &mdash;\ntalked to him about books. Of all things, Pepper Potts-Stark turned out to be a\ncloseted fan of the good, old, traditional hard fantasy of all kinds, from\nTolkien up. She was the one who added her collection of audiobooks to Friday&rsquo;s\n&ldquo;family&rdquo; library section, allowing Peter to listen to both the\nclassics and the new things, written in the time Between.</p><p>And now, oh, now he\nwould have access to <i>everything</i>. He\nwouldn&rsquo;t need Friday to repeat things to him over and over - he would see them\nand <i>remember</i> properly. That would be\nglorious&hellip;!</p><p>He moved to adjust\nthe angle of the screen, but the pad started slipping and his bandaged hands\nwere quite useless in keeping it where it was supposed to be. He tried not to\ndraw any more attention to it, but apparently had made some kind of noise of\ndistress, as immediately his back was being supported and brought up to a\ncomfortable angle, the pad was secured in his lap with the help of a small\nlunch tray and there was an additional pillow supporting his head.</p><p>Mr Stark patted his\nshoulder as he finished by pulling the cover higher up and tucking it around\nPeter&rsquo;s torso. Seriously. It had the potential to become very, very annoying&hellip;\nBut&hellip; Was it so bad that he wanted more of this? Wished for someone to take\ncare of him like that? Like May used to do when he was a little kid and got\nsick every fall &mdash; sitting with him, reading to him, holding him when his\ntemperature went high and stayed there. He didn&rsquo;t want to be <i>sick</i> as such, but somehow being taken\ncare of held an enormous appeal in his eyes.</p><p>But it wasn&rsquo;t\nsomething he could admit, was it?</p><p>Nope. Not to his\nmentor, not to his aunt and not to the CEO of the company that was apparently\ncounting him as one of their employees.</p><p>And most definitely\nnot to a wizard.</p><p>Because. Let&rsquo;s be\nserious.</p><p>Nope.</p><p>&ldquo;Friday, turn\nthe pad on,&rdquo; Mr Stark said softly. &ldquo;And tie the access to Peter&rsquo;s\nvoice pattern.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, boss.\nDone,&rdquo; the AI answered - probably in both links they were wearing,\n&ldquo;Peter, do you want to set up some basic commands that you could use as\nlong as your hands are wrapped?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hm&hellip; A nod\nto scroll down, up for up and clicking links on voice command?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;There is also\na bit of interface that interprets eye movements. You can set it up so that you\nonly have to look at the needed link and blink,&rdquo; his mentor suggested.\n&ldquo;This system is being prepared for various kinds of&hellip; communication\nproblems. For you and some percentage of people, it&rsquo;s just a case of temporary\ndiscomfort, but there is a huge group of accident victims and folks after\nserious illnesses who need this kind of interface on daily basis, probably for\nthe rest of their lives.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh,\nright,&rdquo; Peter grimaced.</p><p>Oh, right, indeed.</p><p>He wasn&rsquo;t going to\ngo into any details though. He wasn&rsquo;t going to suddenly share with his mentor\nall these nights when he woke up from dreams of being completely immobilised,\nweeks when, upon awakening, he checked his arms and legs - shaky, but there,\nuncertain, but still feeling - and touched each finger in an attempt at\ncontrolling the way his brain was screaming to him that he had lost them, <i>lost them</i>, lost the feeling, lost, lost,\nlost&hellip;</p><p>&ldquo;Pete? Pete,\nkid, where did you go?&rdquo;</p><p>He shook himself\noff and tried to smile at Mr Stark, but it must have come across more as\n'sickly&rsquo; than as 'reassuring&rsquo; because he found himself under the close scrutiny\nof his mentor.</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong,\nkiddo?&rdquo;</p><p>Peter took a shuddering\nbreath and relaxed into the pillows slightly.</p><p>&ldquo;Just, bad\ndreams. I remembered something.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Mhm. You know\nyou can tell me if this becomes too much, right? I can tell both Stephen and\nShuri to back off and give you longer breaks between treatments, so you can\nrelax and&hellip; you know. Convince your body you can be off your guard more often\nthan not.&rdquo;</p><p>Oh, yeah. That.</p><p>Embarrassing.</p><p>Because\nMr Stark had been correct.</p><p>Precisely\nright on the bloody dot.</p><p>He\nhad guessed - intuited, deduced - that Peter had been sustaining his most\nwatchful and stressed mode of operation every second since he awoke from his\ncoma. Sheer stress and uncertainty of the situation had not allowed the\nspidey-senses to calm down, even in his sleep. Every stimulus made them go into\noverdrive, his ears catching even the drip of the leaky faucet in the bathroom\na floor above the hospital enclosure. Not to mention the general activity of\nway too many people in a limited space. Rationally, he knew that there were\nmuch fewer people in the Embassy than in his building in Queens, but his\nfeelings had been veritably screaming, warning him of continued danger, danger\nfrom everywhere around him&hellip;!</p><p>Every\ntime one of his sensors calmed down, another picked up the baton - smell of\nhospital disinfectant attacked him when everything quieted at nighttime, then,\nonce the air exchange system kicked in and removed the chemical odour, his\nbrain served him with an attack of restless legs, which was rather annoying,\nconsidering he could barely <i>move</i>\nthese legs.</p><p>But\nthe worst part? He hadn&rsquo;t known what was wrong. Why everyone seemed to stink or\nshout or pinch him. Why every breeze from the window made him shiver down to\nhis bones. Why even the little hairs on his hands <i>hurt</i> every time they raised.</p><p>Only\nwhen Mr Stark called and plainly asked him about the chances of him running\nhimself ragged by sustaining the fighting mode for so long, he started noticing\nthings. Things that should not have happened, had he &ldquo;powered down&rdquo;\nthe spider. At least, thankfully, he hadn&rsquo;t started to stick to anything - but\non the other hand, this would have been a plain hint at what was going on with\nhim&hellip;!</p><p>But,\nwhen he tried to let go and relax, he found out he couldn&rsquo;t.</p><p>And\nthen Mr Stark came and talked him down.</p><p>That\nhad been humiliating.</p><p>Like\na toddler who screams his throat raw because he doesn&rsquo;t want to go to daycare,\nPeter had to be calmed down, from - what he saw now - a shivering, permanently\nalert wreck, into something resembling normal state.</p><p>Normal\nstate included seeing in normal light without feeling as if someone was\nstabbing his brain with knitting needles. As doctor Stephen explained it, the\nenhanced state was inducing additional activity on the side of his rod cells,\nand since his change, the density of said rods on his retina was apparently\nseven times the standard human norm. This made for very good night vision and\npotentially killing headaches if he didn&rsquo;t learn to cover his eyes in time. Or\nto power the whole thing down.</p><p>Mr\nStark had held him, breathed with him, talked him through several attempts at\ngetting himself under control and in general <i>been there</i>, with him, for long hours, until that primitive,\nprotective part of Peter&rsquo;s brain caught on to the fact that he was actually <i>safe</i>, dammit, and laid off flooding his\nsystem with adrenaline. It was such a relief when it stopped that it was nearly\npainful in itself. </p><p>And\nthen, the next day, he was given was the best gift anyone had ever gotten him.\nHe could have hugged Mr Stark - if not for the fact that he was stuck in bed\nwith an IV in each arm and the man was helping him to put on the glasses\ncorrectly. And they were a blessing. A simple application of his own solution\nfor filtering the light, copied from his suit, combined with the shielding\nprovided by Captain Danvers and what seemed to be a durable polymer of latest\ngeneration gave him a perfectly working pair of shades - with side blocks and\nadjustable strap, much more comfortable than the headband and much more useful.</p><p>And\nnow he had a pad - a <i>Stark Pad!</i> - and\nhis half-dim room and his mentor by his side and a project to work on.</p><p>&ldquo;Friday,\ncan you please bring up the file on photovoltaics?&rdquo; he asked quietly.\n&ldquo;And attach all the notes I added, even the ones made when I was kind of\nsleepy.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s\ncoming up, Peter. The notes are attached at the chronological points and by\nkeywords.&rdquo;</p><p>He\nlooked up at Mr Stark, who was watching him with a small frown.</p><p>&ldquo;Um.\nI had Friday read my notes back to me and she recorded all the remarks I made\non rereading. It&rsquo;s mostly small edits, but sometimes I had a new idea sparking\nkind of during the re-read&hellip;&rdquo; he trailed off, watching his mentor&rsquo;s\ncrestfallen face. &ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s\njust that&hellip;&rdquo; the man sighed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Peter. I should have\nthought about the pad earlier. But it&rsquo;s just been&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Too\nmany things at once, I know. I usually forgot about this too, since I&rsquo;ve gotten\nso used to this way of working when I was still, you know. And anyway, with my\nhands being still out of commission, I&rsquo;ll have to dictate any corrections I have.\nIt will be faster than the on-screen keyboard and blinking. This will be OK for\ncoding.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You\nare planning to code by&hellip; blinking?&rdquo;</p><p>Peter\ntried to call a semi-optimistic smile to his lips.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s still better than NOT coding at all.\nAt least now I will have a written language reference to check against. Python\nis interesting and I have to catch up with five years of the language\ndevelopment, so&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Mr\nStark was looking at him with something&hellip; something. Biting his lip.</p><p>&ldquo;OK.\nTell me about these photovoltaics.&rdquo;</p><p>There\nwas a bit of a wobble in that voice.</p><p>&ldquo;Well,\nsince doctor Stephen told me about the number of rods on my retina, I started\nthinking, what about using this for solar power&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Mr\nStark&rsquo;s pad had gone dark as he leaned in closer to have a look.</p><p>&ldquo;Go\non, kiddo. Tell me how you&rsquo;d do this.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So I was thinking\nabout this cell structure&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p><i>Tagging based on the interest in previous chapters, so if you don&rsquo;t want to be included, just let me know :)</i></p><p><i>(if someone wants to be included, I&rsquo;ll be more than happy to add them!)</i></p><p><i><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJomgQAmy08JhLoKD0xotvQ\" target=\"_blank\">@juni-berries</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJUF9-OuH82Ubc6_Jnje_BA\" target=\"_blank\">@bad-poetry-rants-and-fandoms</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mlNFARFgjS__4PgiS6zAhcw\" target=\"_blank\">@hpswl-cumbercookie</a> &#8203; <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mUO_V5vLoYStzfXuSRokSnQ\" target=\"_blank\">@jessieblackwood</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mlGVOqcG1Vcf_e5W6drM7Cg\" target=\"_blank\">@aratinga4</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mZLl5TNp7GEIUBkV9jlI2Bg\" target=\"_blank\">@tmnt-leneah</a></i></p>",
