        "body": "<p><b></b>I know I took a hilariously long time to update, but I did it! Here\u2019s chapter 5! Only two more to go until I\u2019m done!</p><!-- more --><p><b></b></p><p>Meera was properly winded by the time she turned down the long dirt path that led to the humble farmhouse. As she drew closer, the sight of the candle light flickering warmly in the windows nearly made her eyes tear up with longing, or perhaps that was just the wind.\u00a0</p><p>Summer had stayed back looming among the trees. Meera could feel his yellow eyes still pointed at the back of her head. There wasn\u2019t a single weirwood in sight, yet Meera prayed to the Old Gods all the same as she waited on the doorstep. If she couldn\u2019t find a way to get Bran moving again, they\u2019d all be truly fucked.<br/></p><p>As it turned out, the farm owner was in fact a woman. Meera hardly needed to explain her situation, she\u2019d said a thing or two about being robbed on the road from the New Gift before the woman, Gillian, invited her inside.\u00a0</p><p>Gillian remarked that she and her children were headed to Winterfell in two days as well, and wasn\u2019t it lucky that Meera had found them when she did? Meera nodded and smiled and agreed to watch the children while Gillian brought her horses back up the road to fetch Meera\u2019s \u201chusband\u201d and \u201cfather\u201d. </p><p>That was several hours ago. With the sun long down, almost everyone else had gone upstairs to bed, leaving Bran and Meera alone by the kitchen hearth. They\u2019d had a bit of soup with carrots and beets for supper, perhaps the first truly hot meal they\u2019d had since Castle Black. It had made Meera both drowsy and giddy, and she could tell Bran felt the same way. </p><p>On the kitchen table, there was a small bowl of apple vinegar, a brush, and a pair of sewing scissors, which Meera was using to clean and cut Bran\u2019s overgrown hair. After every couple of passes through Bran\u2019s hair, the brush would be so full of dirt and grime that Meera found it quite unbelievable. </p><p>\t\u201cDon\u2019t cut it too short,\u201d Bran said, \u201cI like my hair.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cI like your hair too,\u201d Meera mused, snipping and brushing away, \u201cBut I must be able to see your eyes.\u201d After a final run-through with the brush, the warm brown of Bran\u2019s hair was finally visible, rich and glossy in the firelight. Bran reached up and hummed as he ran his fingers through it. </p><p>\u201cYour turn now,\u201d he offered.</p><p>Meera settled cross legged on the rug just before the fire. She shrugged off her heavy furs, undid her belts, took off her boots, until she sat at Bran\u2019s feet in nothing but her thin woolen tunic, her tangled curls reaching all the way down to her round tummy.\u00a0</p><p>They didn\u2019t speak much. Bran\u2019s careful fingers worked the worst of the tangles out of her hair; the brush and scissors took care of the rest. Meera sighed softly, resting her head against Bran\u2019s knee. He swept her hair upward from the nape of her neck, and leaned over to press a lingering kiss behind her ear. Before he could pull away though, Meera\u2019s hand stopped him.</p><p>\t\u201cRight now?\u201d Bran asked, \u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cGet down here Brandon, you started it.\u201d</p><p>Bran protested vaguely, even as he slid down to the floor to be next to her. His lips met hers, warm and soft and safe. \u201cWe\u2019re in someone\u2019s kitchen,\u201d he whispered. Another kiss. \u201cYou\u2019re very perceptive,\u201d she replied. Bran tucked his head under her jaw to bite at Meera\u2019s neck, earning a shiver and a fettered gasp. He laughed into her skin.</p><p>\t\u201cAre we doing it now?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\t\u201cWouldn\u2019t be too scandalous if we did,\u201d Bran said, \u201cWe\u2019ve been saying we\u2019re married so often, I half believe it myself.\u201d </p><p>\tMeera smiled softly. Their front as a married couple was something she reflected on every now and then. They certainly behaved like they were married, and had no trouble at all getting others to believe to too, but what would really happen when Meera gave birth, still unwed? Bran said time and again that she could have the baby at Winterfell, but what would that mean for their future?\u00a0</p><p>Was she to be Bran\u2019s kept mistress? Meera wasn\u2019t comfortable with that idea; she felt like she had always been much more than that- a protector, a sister-in-arms, a friend, and a lover. Would the nobles of the north understand that if she married Bran? Meera wasn\u2019t stupid. She knew Bran could do much better for himself as the heir to Winterfell. </p><p>\t\u201cYou\u2019re thinking about something,\u201d Bran said.</p><p>\t\u201cYes,\u201d she replied.</p><p>\t\u201cTell me?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cBran,\u201d she met his eyes, \u201cWhat happens to me and the baby if we don\u2019t get married?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cI won\u2019t send you away, I would never-\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cI know you wouldn\u2019t,\u201d she said, taking his hand in hers, \u201cBut what am I to do at Winterfell? Who would I be to you? Would our baby\u2019s name be Stark or Snow?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cYou know I\u2019d marry you in an instant,\u201d Bran said softly, stroking her cheek, \u201cI\u2019ve known since I was young that who I married was never going to be up to me. I guess it seemed like too much to hope for.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cI understand.\u201d Meera herself had her own budding marriage prospects back at Greywater- but then Jojen had left home, and she had been chasing after him ever since. </p><p>\t\u201cWe could marry and no one could stop us,\u201d Bran went on, \u201cNo one could order me not to, not when Winterfell is mine.\u201d He got a faraway look in his eyes, the one that told Meera he was thinking of the things he saw through the trees. \u201cBut Robb married who he wanted\u2026 and we know where he is now.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cIt wasn\u2019t his fault,\u201d Meera whispered, \u201cHe was only trying to make reparations and pay his respects when they murdered him.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cIt<i> was</i> his fault,\u201d Bran whispered, \u201cThey were so stupid, Robb should\u2019ve just married Roselyn. He never should have loved Jeyne. How could they be so stupid?\u201d</p><p>He shook quietly with breath and tears, and pressed the hand not holding Meera\u2019s to his mouth. Meera felt herself beginning to cry. She held Bran as her own tears ran along her nose. </p><p>\t\u201cOh Gods,\u201d Bran sobbed, \u201cI can\u2019t bear to think about it, so I don\u2019t, but then I just feel so <i>empty</i>.\u201d It was too easy to forget the horrors that Bran had seen- that he never asked to see, and could never forget.

Only two more to go until I\u2019m done!</p>[[MORE]]<p><b></b></p><p>Meera was properly winded by the time she turned down the long dirt path that led to the humble farmhouse. As she drew closer, the sight of the candle light flickering warmly in the windows nearly made her eyes tear up with longing, or perhaps that was just the wind.\u00a0</p><p>Summer had stayed back looming among the trees. Meera could feel his yellow eyes still pointed at the back of her head. There wasn\u2019t a single weirwood in sight, yet Meera prayed to the Old Gods all the same as she waited on the doorstep. If she couldn\u2019t find a way to get Bran moving again, they\u2019d all be truly fucked.<br></p><p>As it turned out, the farm owner was in fact a woman. Meera hardly needed to explain her situation, she\u2019d said a thing or two about being robbed on the road from the New Gift before the woman, Gillian, invited her inside.\u00a0</p><p>Gillian remarked that she and her children were headed to Winterfell in two days as well, and wasn\u2019t it lucky that Meera had found them when she did? Meera nodded and smiled and agreed to watch the children while Gillian brought her horses back up the road to fetch Meera\u2019s \u201chusband\u201d and \u201cfather\u201d. </p><p>That was several hours ago. With the sun long down, almost everyone else had gone upstairs to bed, leaving Bran and Meera alone by the kitchen hearth. They\u2019d had a bit of soup with carrots and beets for supper, perhaps the first truly hot meal they\u2019d had since Castle Black. It had made Meera both drowsy and giddy, and she could tell Bran felt the same way. </p><p>On the kitchen table, there was a small bowl of apple vinegar, a brush, and a pair of sewing scissors, which Meera was using to clean and cut Bran\u2019s overgrown hair. After every couple of passes through Bran\u2019s hair, the brush would be so full of dirt and grime that Meera found it quite unbelievable. </p><p>\t\u201cDon\u2019t cut it too short,\u201d Bran said, \u201cI like my hair.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cI like your hair too,\u201d Meera mused, snipping and brushing away, \u201cBut I must be able to see your eyes.\u201d After a final run-through with the brush, the warm brown of Bran\u2019s hair was finally visible, rich and glossy in the firelight. Bran reached up and hummed as he ran his fingers through it. </p><p>\u201cYour turn now,\u201d he offered.</p><p>Meera settled cross legged on the rug just before the fire. She shrugged off her heavy furs, undid her belts, took off her boots, until she sat at Bran\u2019s feet in nothing but her thin woolen tunic, her tangled curls reaching all the way down to her round tummy.\u00a0</p><p>They didn\u2019t speak much. Bran\u2019s careful fingers worked the worst of the tangles out of her hair; the brush and scissors took care of the rest. Meera sighed softly, resting her head against Bran\u2019s knee. He swept her hair upward from the nape of her neck, and leaned over to press a lingering kiss behind her ear. Before he could pull away though, Meera\u2019s hand stopped him.</p><p>\t\u201cRight now?\u201d Bran asked, \u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cGet down here Brandon, you started it.\u201d</p><p>Bran protested vaguely, even as he slid down to the floor to be next to her. His lips met hers, warm and soft and safe. \u201cWe\u2019re in someone\u2019s kitchen,\u201d he whispered. Another kiss. \u201cYou\u2019re very perceptive,\u201d she replied. Bran tucked his head under her jaw to bite at Meera\u2019s neck, earning a shiver and a fettered gasp. He laughed into her skin.</p><p>\t\u201cAre we doing it now?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\t\u201cWouldn\u2019t be too scandalous if we did,\u201d Bran said, \u201cWe\u2019ve been saying we\u2019re married so often, I half believe it myself.\u201d </p><p>\tMeera smiled softly. Their front as a married couple was something she reflected on every now and then. They certainly behaved like they were married, and had no trouble at all getting others to believe to too, but what would really happen when Meera gave birth, still unwed? Bran said time and again that she could have the baby at Winterfell, but what would that mean for their future?\u00a0</p><p>Was she to be Bran\u2019s kept mistress? Meera wasn\u2019t comfortable with that idea; she felt like she had always been much more than that- a protector, a sister-in-arms, a friend, and a lover. Would the nobles of the north understand that if she married Bran? Meera wasn\u2019t stupid. She knew Bran could do much better for himself as the heir to Winterfell. </p><p>\t\u201cYou\u2019re thinking about something,\u201d Bran said.</p><p>\t\u201cYes,\u201d she replied.</p><p>\t\u201cTell me?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cBran,\u201d she met his eyes, \u201cWhat happens to me and the baby if we don\u2019t get married?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cI won\u2019t send you away, I would never-\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cI know you wouldn\u2019t,\u201d she said, taking his hand in hers, \u201cBut what am I to do at Winterfell? Who would I be to you? Would our baby\u2019s name be Stark or Snow?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cYou know I\u2019d marry you in an instant,\u201d Bran said softly, stroking her cheek, \u201cI\u2019ve known since I was young that who I married was never going to be up to me. I guess it seemed like too much to hope for.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cI understand.\u201d Meera herself had her own budding marriage prospects back at Greywater- but then Jojen had left home, and she had been chasing after him ever since. </p><p>\t\u201cWe could marry and no one could stop us,\u201d Bran went on, \u201cNo one could order me not to, not when Winterfell is mine.\u201d He got a faraway look in his eyes, the one that told Meera he was thinking of the things he saw through the trees. \u201cBut Robb married who he wanted\u2026 and we know where he is now.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cIt wasn\u2019t his fault,\u201d Meera whispered, \u201cHe was only trying to make reparations and pay his respects when they murdered him.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cIt<i> was</i> his fault,\u201d Bran whispered, \u201cThey were so stupid, Robb should\u2019ve just married Roselyn. He never should have loved Jeyne. How could they be so stupid?\u201d</p><p>He shook quietly with breath and tears, and pressed the hand not holding Meera\u2019s to his mouth. Meera felt herself beginning to cry. She held Bran as her own tears ran along her nose. </p><p>\t\u201cOh Gods,\u201d Bran sobbed, \u201cI can\u2019t bear to think about it, so I don\u2019t, but then I just feel so <i>empty</i>.\u201d It was too easy to forget the horrors that Bran had seen- that he never asked to see, and could never forget. It reminded Meera of Jojen. </p><p>Bran cried into her shoulder. \u201cHow could they do that to him? How could they?\u201d They held each other until the fire burned low. <i>I don\u2019t want anyone to hurt you</i>, Bran said to her, over and over again, <i>I couldn\u2019t bear it.</i></p><p>~*~*~*~*~*~</p><p>The milky winter sun was in Meera\u2019s eyes from the moment she opened them.

After every couple of passes through Bran&rsquo;s hair, the brush would be so full of dirt and grime that Meera found it quite unbelievable. </p><p>\t&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t cut it too short,&rdquo; Bran said, &ldquo;I like my hair.&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;I like your hair too,&rdquo; Meera mused, snipping and brushing away, &ldquo;But I must be able to see your eyes.&rdquo; After a final run-through with the brush, the warm brown of Bran&rsquo;s hair was finally visible, rich and glossy in the firelight. Bran reached up and hummed as he ran his fingers through it. </p><p>&ldquo;Your turn now,&rdquo; he offered.</p><p>Meera settled cross legged on the rug just before the fire. She shrugged off her heavy furs, undid her belts, took off her boots, until she sat at Bran&rsquo;s feet in nothing but her thin woolen tunic, her tangled curls reaching all the way down to her round tummy.&nbsp;</p><p>They didn&rsquo;t speak much. Bran&rsquo;s careful fingers worked the worst of the tangles out of her hair; the brush and scissors took care of the rest. Meera sighed softly, resting her head against Bran&rsquo;s knee. He swept her hair upward from the nape of her neck, and leaned over to press a lingering kiss behind her ear. Before he could pull away though, Meera&rsquo;s hand stopped him.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Right now?&rdquo; Bran asked, &ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Get down here Brandon, you started it.&rdquo;</p><p>Bran protested vaguely, even as he slid down to the floor to be next to her. His lips met hers, warm and soft and safe. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re in someone&rsquo;s kitchen,&rdquo; he whispered. Another kiss. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re very perceptive,&rdquo; she replied. Bran tucked his head under her jaw to bite at Meera&rsquo;s neck, earning a shiver and a fettered gasp. He laughed into her skin.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Are we doing it now?&rdquo; she asked.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t be too scandalous if we did,&rdquo; Bran said, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been saying we&rsquo;re married so often, I half believe it myself.&rdquo; </p><p>\tMeera smiled softly. Their front as a married couple was something she reflected on every now and then. They certainly behaved like they were married, and had no trouble at all getting others to believe to too, but what would really happen when Meera gave birth, still unwed? Bran said time and again that she could have the baby at Winterfell, but what would that mean for their future?&nbsp;</p><p>Was she to be Bran&rsquo;s kept mistress? Meera wasn&rsquo;t comfortable with that idea; she felt like she had always been much more than that- a protector, a sister-in-arms, a friend, and a lover. Would the nobles of the north understand that if she married Bran? Meera wasn&rsquo;t stupid. She knew Bran could do much better for himself as the heir to Winterfell. </p><p>\t&ldquo;You&rsquo;re thinking about something,&rdquo; Bran said.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she replied.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Tell me?&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Bran,&rdquo; she met his eyes, &ldquo;What happens to me and the baby if we don&rsquo;t get married?&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t send you away, I would never-&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;I know you wouldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she said, taking his hand in hers, &ldquo;But what am I to do at Winterfell? Who would I be to you? Would our baby&rsquo;s name be Stark or Snow?&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;You know I&rsquo;d marry you in an instant,&rdquo; Bran said softly, stroking her cheek, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve known since I was young that who I married was never going to be up to me. I guess it seemed like too much to hope for.&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;I understand.&rdquo; Meera herself had her own budding marriage prospects back at Greywater- but then Jojen had left home, and she had been chasing after him ever since. </p><p>\t&ldquo;We could marry and no one could stop us,&rdquo; Bran went on, &ldquo;No one could order me not to, not when Winterfell is mine.&rdquo; He got a faraway look in his eyes, the one that told Meera he was thinking of the things he saw through the trees. &ldquo;But Robb married who he wanted&hellip; and we know where he is now.&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t his fault,&rdquo; Meera whispered, &ldquo;He was only trying to make reparations and pay his respects when they murdered him.&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;It<i> was</i> his fault,&rdquo; Bran whispered, &ldquo;They were so stupid, Robb should&rsquo;ve just married Roselyn. He never should have loved Jeyne. How could they be so stupid?&rdquo;</p><p>He shook quietly with breath and tears, and pressed the hand not holding Meera&rsquo;s to his mouth. Meera felt herself beginning to cry. She held Bran as her own tears ran along her nose. </p><p>\t&ldquo;Oh Gods,&rdquo; Bran sobbed, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t bear to think about it, so I don&rsquo;t, but then I just feel so <i>empty</i>.&rdquo; It was too easy to forget the horrors that Bran had seen- that he never asked to see, and could never forget. It reminded Meera of Jojen. </p><p>Bran cried into her shoulder. &ldquo;How could they do that to him? How could they?&rdquo; They held each other until the fire burned low. <i>I don&rsquo;t want anyone to hurt you</i>, Bran said to her, over and over again, <i>I couldn&rsquo;t bear it.</i></p><p>~*~*~*~*~*~</p><p>The milky winter sun was in Meera&rsquo;s eyes from the moment she opened them. Light washed over the wooden floor, illuminating the smoking remains of the night&rsquo;s fire, and a still-snoring Bran. It was the first time in a long time that they&rsquo;d spent the night within four walls, and the color had already returned to Bran&rsquo;s lips and cheeks. Meera hoped he was dreaming of something pleasant. Just then, the baby squirmed, and she felt an urgent squeeze between her legs.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Ugh,&rdquo; she groaned, pushing herself to her feet. She quickly pulled on her furs and belts, intending to find a bush outside, or perhaps a grove of trees. Suddenly, there was an animalistic yelp from beyond the window. Meera froze. Then came a series of short howls, and the sound of something- or someone, falling and scratching in the dirt. Meera grabbed her spear and hurried out the door.</p><p>The commotion was coming from the vegetable patch behind the kitchen window. Summer was jumping and prancing uncharacteristically around a young man who lay belly up in the dirt, yelping with frustration.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Summer!&rdquo; Meera called, &ldquo;To me!&rdquo; The direwolf paused to look at her with what could&rsquo;ve been amusement, then bowed his head and made his way to Meera&rsquo;s side. The young man sprang to his feet with a curse. Something orange and carrot-like dropped out of his pocket.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; Meera demanded. She felt confident with a spear in her hand, and a direwolf at her side. The young man pulled his hat back over his dark hair. Something about his large, grey eyes haunted Meera with familiarity, something she couldn&rsquo;t quite put her finger on. </p><p>\t&ldquo;No one,&rdquo; the man answered, in a woman&rsquo;s voice.</p>",

I won\u2019t specify so your creativity can flow!</b><br/></p><p><b>Warning: Angst, Season 8 prediction, so not a spoiler!<br/></b></p><p><b>Enjoy!</b></p><p>~~~~~~~~~</p><p>Winterfell looked tragically abandoned from the outside. Much more haunting than you remembered. You were just a girl when you left, but back then it was bustling with life, and there were so many smiles on everyone\u2019s faces, but mostly from the Stark family.</p><p>You were a lord\u2019s daughter, long since passed, but during the time he was alive, you and your family went to visit Winterfell. While your father spoke with Ned Stark, you took your time to play with the children your age. Arya, Bran, and Rickon would run around and play games with you, much to your mother\u2019s distaste. She would much rather have you taking an embroidery class with Ned Stark\u2019s eldest daughter, Sansa. But you figured if Arya can play with the boys, why can\u2019t you? Your family stayed in Winterfell for about a month, and this was during the time King Robert brought his family to pay his respects to House Arryn. However, your family left before the House Baratheon did.</p><p>But that was a long time ago. Since then, your entire House had been destroyed&hellip; everyone but you. You had managed to escape your family\u2019s home when Joffrey\u2019s men attacked. The young and cruel king had wanted you dead after you laughed at him for crying when Arya\u2019s direwolf, Nymeria, had bitten him. The little cunt always remembered anyone who has dared doubted him in the past. But back then, since you were a noble girl, he couldn\u2019t send the Hound on you, so when he was crowned king, he didn\u2019t waste any time when he sent a small army of ruthless men to your doors.</p><p>Your mother died protecting the secret passage she made you escape through. It led into the sewers and you escaped by following that to the nearest river. From there, trudging in filth and dirt and water, you and your torn dress traveled to the closest homestead, which just so happened to be the house of Clan Frey.</p><p>Walder Frey was cruel to you and made you a slave of his house. His sons and grandsons did awful things to you, but his daughters and granddaughters always protected you enough so that the men would never so much as kill you. You would stay under the Frey\u2019s\u00a0\u201cprotection\u201d until Robb Stark would one day arrive with an allegiance\u00a0proposal. Recognizing you, Robb sent you to Catelyn Stark, who immediately cleaned and fed you. Through her kindness, she had two of Robb\u2019s men accompany you to the Vale, where Catelyn promised you that her sister would look out for you.</p><p>For a few more years, you stayed in House Arryn\u2019s protection. After Lysa was killed, Petyr Baelish took control of the Vale and sent Sansa away, your only friend when she had arrived there. Eventually, Littlefinger would have you leave as well, but he sent you far away to the city of Volantis. A young woman now, you were at high risk of being sold as a slave, so you cut your hair and wore baggier clothes to appear as a boy. While in Volantis, only one person appeared to recognize you, and that person was Varys, the Mad King\u2019s spider. You heard stories about his schemes and the whispers he always told any ruler he worked for, so you had recognized him, too. Knowing of your family\u2019s fate, Varys offered to have you travel with him to Meereen, where he suspected Tyrion Lannister was already there with Queen Daenerys of House Targaryen. Your past childhood sprung to life at the promise of dragons, so you agreed to go with him.</p><p>Since then, it has been quite an adventure. Daenerys kept you close and treated you like a little sister. You traveled with her, Tyrion, and the rest of her court to Dragonstone, where eventually you would reunite with Jon Snow. While he and Ser Davos were there, he received word from Sansa that both Arya and Bran were alive and in Winterfell with her, and immediately you felt ten times lighter. You begged the queen to go with Jon Snow if he were to travel back home, but Daenerys was very protective of you now, and she refused you. Eventually, everyone would sail to the White Harbor and ride onto Winterfell, and as you stood just outside its gates, you felt heartbroken to see it in near ruin.</p><p>Walking inside, Jon and Daenerys strode over to Sansa, who was already waiting for them. As all of Daenerys\u2019 armies were inside the gates, they all dispersed to find bedding. But Sansa directed you and Jon to the courtroom, where her other siblings were waiting.</p><p>Arya leaped into Jon\u2019s arms first before moving onto you. She was much different than you remembered her, but definitely much better looking like a soldier than a lady. When she cleared the way towards the fireplace, you and Jon locked your sites on Bran.</p><p>His hair was much shorter now and he had grown into a strong looking teenager, despite the fact that he was in a wheelchair. His eyes were distant, as he had yet looked away from the fire to meet your eyes. The air around him felt different, and it was almost hard to breathe when you sat across from him.</p><p>\u201cBran?\u201d You called out softly.<br/></p><p>Jon stood by your side, gazing down at his brother with concern until the younger Stark boy finally looked up at the pair of you, a small smile that didn\u2019t exactly reach his eyes appeared on his lips.</p><p>\u201cHello, Y/n. Hello, Jon. Welcome back.\u201d<br/></p><p>The reunion was cut short since apparently, Bran and Samwell Tarly had something urgent to tell Jon. For hours, the three men were locked away in the room while you stood outside. Eventually, Jon and Sam left, the latter looking worried as Jon was pale as a ghost. Once they cleared the room, you snuck back inside because you really wanted to talk to Bran.</p><p>\u201cI saw you at the Twins,\u201d he started with, not even looking up from the fire yet again when you entered the room.<br/></p><p>\u201cYou saw me?\u201d You gasped, sitting across from him again,\u00a0\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you approach me? What in the Seven Hells were you doing there?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t there.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cBut, you just said-!\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cI am the Three-Eyed-Raven now.\u201d<br/></p><p>You paused, looking at him strangely like he had just grown a third, direwolf head,\u00a0\u201cThe Three-Eyed what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRaven. I can see anything past or present, but not future.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cLike a warg?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cExactly like a warg.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cProve it,\u201d you challenged, feeling a small, smug smirk on your face.<br/></p><p>Bran didn\u2019t even hesitate, as he looked you in the eye with a faraway look,\u00a0\u201cYou were raped by one of Walder Frey\u2019s men. You were eleven at the time it happened, and he would have killed you after you started to bleed, but his sisters came in and stopped him.\u201d</p><p>Your skin became completely pale as Bran told the story, your smile had fallen as he continued,\u00a0\u201cYou were sick in bed for the following two weeks. And the only thing that kept you calm was the thought of being back at Winterfell, going back to the way things were.\u201d</p><p>You felt sick, but you addressed Bran\u2019s story with a confirmed nod,\u00a0\u201cI still wish that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt can\u2019t happen.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d You frowned, clearly not liking this new side of Bran. You remembered him to be a free spirit and always able to make you laugh. He was adventurous and cunning for a boy, but now a young man, Bran didn\u2019t appear to be any of that.<br/></p><p>\u201cBecause I am no longer Bran Stark. I am&ndash;\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cYou already told me you are the Three-Eyed-Bloody-Raven,\u201d you snapped,\u00a0\u201cBut I didn\u2019t come all this way just for you to tell me \u2018no\u2019 and crush all of my hopes and dreams. You\u2019re my friend, Bran. You have always been my friend.\u201d<br/></p><p>When he didn\u2019t say anything, just staring at you with that blank expression, you felt like an icicle was piercing your heart,\u00a0\u201cOr do you think I\u2019m wrong on that, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have always been such a beautiful girl, Y/n, even when we were children, you were much prettier than my sisters. When I had asked my mother about your beauty, she laughed and said that maybe the gods had made you by hand.\u201d<br/></p><p>You couldn\u2019t help but blush at what you assumed was a compliment, all the while Bran carried on,\u00a0\u201cOnce I learned how to see, it was around the same time Joffrey killed your family. When I couldn\u2019t see what had become of you, I assumed you were dead. Ever since then, I tried not to think about you. I learned not to feel anything, even when I tried to see how you were doing, where you were in the world, and what you were doing. In time&hellip; I learned to stop caring.\u201d</p><p>You felt it was hard to swallow as your throat started to swell up,\u00a0\u201cAbout me?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cAbout everything. Like I said, I\u2019m not Bran anymore.\u201d<br/></p><p>As you tried to read his expression, you realized he was right. He didn\u2019t even bat an eyelash at you. He didn\u2019t even care that this answer was clearly affecting you. If he cared, even for a moment, that you were starting to cry, he didn\u2019t show it.</p><p>You got up to leave the room, your hand opening the door as a thought occurred to you, and you turned back to the Three-Eyed-Raven,\u00a0\u201cIf Bran were here, would he have wanted to see me?\u201d</p><p>What used to be Bran looked up at you, and without skipping a beat, he answered,\u00a0\u201cYes. More than anything, he would have wanted to be with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if I wanted to also be with Bran, would he come back?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cNo&hellip; Bran is dead.\u201d<br/></p><p>And you left the room after that, knowing he spoke the truth. But he did give you a little bit of a comforting clarity. If Bran were here, he would have loved you. And you were just going to have to hang onto that.\u00a0</p><p>~~~~~~~~~</p><p><b>Wow! Sorry for the very long post, but hurray my first Game of Thrones imagine! I hoped you liked it! Sorry that it was a sad ending. My fingers wouldn\u2019t stop typing and I got carried away, but it\u2019s Game of Thrones. Happy ending doesn\u2019t exactly, you know, happen. But all the same, I hope you enjoyed it.

Hello, Jon. Welcome back.\u201d<br></p><p>The reunion was cut short since apparently, Bran and Samwell Tarly had something urgent to tell Jon. For hours, the three men were locked away in the room while you stood outside. Eventually, Jon and Sam left, the latter looking worried as Jon was pale as a ghost.

I can see anything past or present, but not future.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cLike a warg?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cExactly like a warg.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cProve it,\u201d you challenged, feeling a small, smug smirk on your face.<br></p><p>Bran didn\u2019t even hesitate, as he looked you in the eye with a faraway look,\u00a0\u201cYou were raped by one of Walder Frey\u2019s men. You were eleven at the time it happened, and he would have killed you after you started to bleed, but his sisters came in and stopped him.\u201d</p><p>Your skin became completely pale as Bran told the story, your smile had fallen as he continued,\u00a0\u201cYou were sick in bed for the following two weeks. And the only thing that kept you calm was the thought of being back at Winterfell, going back to the way things were.\u201d</p><p>You felt sick, but you addressed Bran\u2019s story with a confirmed nod,\u00a0\u201cI still wish that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt can\u2019t happen.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d You frowned, clearly not liking this new side of Bran.

He was adventurous and cunning for a boy, but now a young man, Bran didn\u2019t appear to be any of that.<br></p><p>\u201cBecause I am no longer Bran Stark.

When I had asked my mother about your beauty, she laughed and said that maybe the gods had made you by hand.\u201d<br></p><p>You couldn\u2019t help but blush at what you assumed was a compliment, all the while Bran carried on,\u00a0\u201cOnce I learned how to see, it was around the same time Joffrey killed your family. When I couldn\u2019t see what had become of you, I assumed you were dead. Ever since then, I tried not to think about you. I learned not to feel anything, even when I tried to see how you were doing, where you were in the world, and what you were doing. In time\u2026 I learned to stop caring.\u201d</p><p>You felt it was hard to swallow as your throat started to swell up,\u00a0\u201cAbout me?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cAbout everything.

He didn\u2019t even care that this answer was clearly affecting you. If he cared, even for a moment, that you were starting to cry, he didn\u2019t show it.</p><p>You got up to leave the room, your hand opening the door as a thought occurred to you, and you turned back to the Three-Eyed-Raven,\u00a0\u201cIf Bran were here, would he have wanted to see me?\u201d</p><p>What used to be Bran looked up at you, and without skipping a beat, he answered,\u00a0\u201cYes. More than anything, he would have wanted to be with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if I wanted to also be with Bran, would he come back?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cNo\u2026 Bran is dead.\u201d<br></p><p>And you left the room after that, knowing he spoke the truth.

How about a Bran Stark x Fem!reader or Jojen Reed x Reader ( not picky whichever you feel more inspired with) if you won\u2019t mind angst that ends in fluff! I won\u2019t specify so your creativity can flow!</b><br></p><p><b>Warning: Angst, Season 8 prediction, so not a spoiler!<br></b></p><p><b>Enjoy!</b></p><p>~~~~~~~~~</p><p>Winterfell looked tragically abandoned from the outside. Much more haunting than you remembered. You were just a girl when you left, but back then it was bustling with life, and there were so many smiles on everyone\u2019s faces, but mostly from the Stark family.</p><p>You were a lord\u2019s daughter, long since passed, but during the time he was alive, you and your family went to visit Winterfell. While your father spoke with Ned Stark, you took your time to play with the children your age. Arya, Bran, and Rickon would run around and play games with you, much to your mother\u2019s distaste. She would much rather have you taking an embroidery class with Ned Stark\u2019s eldest daughter, Sansa. But you figured if Arya can play with the boys, why can\u2019t you? Your family stayed in Winterfell for about a month, and this was during the time King Robert brought his family to pay his respects to House Arryn. However, your family left before the House Baratheon did.</p><p>But that was a long time ago. Since then, your entire House had been destroyed\u2026 everyone but you. You had managed to escape your family\u2019s home when Joffrey\u2019s men attacked. The young and cruel king had wanted you dead after you laughed at him for crying when Arya\u2019s direwolf, Nymeria, had bitten him. The little cunt always remembered anyone who has dared doubted him in the past. But back then, since you were a noble girl, he couldn\u2019t send the Hound on you, so when he was crowned king, he didn\u2019t waste any time when he sent a small army of ruthless men to your doors.</p><p>Your mother died protecting the secret passage she made you escape through. It led into the sewers and you escaped by following that to the nearest river. From there, trudging in filth and dirt and water, you and your torn dress traveled to the closest homestead, which just so happened to be the house of Clan Frey.</p><p>Walder Frey was cruel to you and made you a slave of his house. His sons and grandsons did awful things to you, but his daughters and granddaughters always protected you enough so that the men would never so much as kill you. You would stay under the Frey\u2019s\u00a0\u201cprotection\u201d until Robb Stark would one day arrive with an allegiance\u00a0proposal. Recognizing you, Robb sent you to Catelyn Stark, who immediately cleaned and fed you. Through her kindness, she had two of Robb\u2019s men accompany you to the Vale, where Catelyn promised you that her sister would look out for you.</p><p>For a few more years, you stayed in House Arryn\u2019s protection. After Lysa was killed, Petyr Baelish took control of the Vale and sent Sansa away, your only friend when she had arrived there. Eventually, Littlefinger would have you leave as well, but he sent you far away to the city of Volantis. A young woman now, you were at high risk of being sold as a slave, so you cut your hair and wore baggier clothes to appear as a boy. While in Volantis, only one person appeared to recognize you, and that person was Varys, the Mad King\u2019s spider. You heard stories about his schemes and the whispers he always told any ruler he worked for, so you had recognized him, too. Knowing of your family\u2019s fate, Varys offered to have you travel with him to Meereen, where he suspected Tyrion Lannister was already there with Queen Daenerys of House Targaryen. Your past childhood sprung to life at the promise of dragons, so you agreed to go with him.</p><p>Since then, it has been quite an adventure. Daenerys kept you close and treated you like a little sister. You traveled with her, Tyrion, and the rest of her court to Dragonstone, where eventually you would reunite with Jon Snow. While he and Ser Davos were there, he received word from Sansa that both Arya and Bran were alive and in Winterfell with her, and immediately you felt ten times lighter. You begged the queen to go with Jon Snow if he were to travel back home, but Daenerys was very protective of you now, and she refused you. Eventually, everyone would sail to the White Harbor and ride onto Winterfell, and as you stood just outside its gates, you felt heartbroken to see it in near ruin.</p><p>Walking inside, Jon and Daenerys strode over to Sansa, who was already waiting for them. As all of Daenerys\u2019 armies were inside the gates, they all dispersed to find bedding. But Sansa directed you and Jon to the courtroom, where her other siblings were waiting.</p><p>Arya leaped into Jon\u2019s arms first before moving onto you. She was much different than you remembered her, but definitely much better looking like a soldier than a lady. When she cleared the way towards the fireplace, you and Jon locked your sites on Bran.</p><p>His hair was much shorter now and he had grown into a strong looking teenager, despite the fact that he was in a wheelchair. His eyes were distant, as he had yet looked away from the fire to meet your eyes. The air around him felt different, and it was almost hard to breathe when you sat across from him.</p><p>\u201cBran?\u201d You called out softly.<br></p><p>Jon stood by your side, gazing down at his brother with concern until the younger Stark boy finally looked up at the pair of you, a small smile that didn\u2019t exactly reach his eyes appeared on his lips.</p><p>\u201cHello, Y/n.

What in the Seven Hells were you doing there?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t there.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;But, you just said-!&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I am the Three-Eyed-Raven now.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>You paused, looking at him strangely like he had just grown a third, direwolf head,&nbsp;&ldquo;The Three-Eyed what?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Raven. I can see anything past or present, but not future.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Like a warg?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Exactly like a warg.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Prove it,&rdquo; you challenged, feeling a small, smug smirk on your face.<br /></p><p>Bran didn&rsquo;t even hesitate, as he looked you in the eye with a faraway look,&nbsp;&ldquo;You were raped by one of Walder Frey&rsquo;s men. You were eleven at the time it happened, and he would have killed you after you started to bleed, but his sisters came in and stopped him.&rdquo;</p><p>Your skin became completely pale as Bran told the story, your smile had fallen as he continued,&nbsp;&ldquo;You were sick in bed for the following two weeks. And the only thing that kept you calm was the thought of being back at Winterfell, going back to the way things were.&rdquo;</p><p>You felt sick, but you addressed Bran&rsquo;s story with a confirmed nod,&nbsp;&ldquo;I still wish that.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t happen.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; You frowned, clearly not liking this new side of Bran. You remembered him to be a free spirit and always able to make you laugh. He was adventurous and cunning for a boy, but now a young man, Bran didn&rsquo;t appear to be any of that.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Because I am no longer Bran Stark. I am&ndash;&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You already told me you are the Three-Eyed-Bloody-Raven,&rdquo; you snapped,&nbsp;&ldquo;But I didn&rsquo;t come all this way just for you to tell me &lsquo;no&rsquo; and crush all of my hopes and dreams. You&rsquo;re my friend, Bran. You have always been my friend.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>When he didn&rsquo;t say anything, just staring at you with that blank expression, you felt like an icicle was piercing your heart,&nbsp;&ldquo;Or do you think I&rsquo;m wrong on that, too?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You have always been such a beautiful girl, Y/n, even when we were children, you were much prettier than my sisters. When I had asked my mother about your beauty, she laughed and said that maybe the gods had made you by hand.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>You couldn&rsquo;t help but blush at what you assumed was a compliment, all the while Bran carried on,&nbsp;&ldquo;Once I learned how to see, it was around the same time Joffrey killed your family. When I couldn&rsquo;t see what had become of you, I assumed you were dead. Ever since then, I tried not to think about you. I learned not to feel anything, even when I tried to see how you were doing, where you were in the world, and what you were doing. In time&hellip; I learned to stop caring.&rdquo;</p><p>You felt it was hard to swallow as your throat started to swell up,&nbsp;&ldquo;About me?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;About everything. Like I said, I&rsquo;m not Bran anymore.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>As you tried to read his expression, you realized he was right. He didn&rsquo;t even bat an eyelash at you. He didn&rsquo;t even care that this answer was clearly affecting you. If he cared, even for a moment, that you were starting to cry, he didn&rsquo;t show it.</p><p>You got up to leave the room, your hand opening the door as a thought occurred to you, and you turned back to the Three-Eyed-Raven,&nbsp;&ldquo;If Bran were here, would he have wanted to see me?&rdquo;</p><p>What used to be Bran looked up at you, and without skipping a beat, he answered,&nbsp;&ldquo;Yes. More than anything, he would have wanted to be with you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And if I wanted to also be with Bran, would he come back?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;No&hellip; Bran is dead.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>And you left the room after that, knowing he spoke the truth. But he did give you a little bit of a comforting clarity. If Bran were here, he would have loved you. And you were just going to have to hang onto that.&nbsp;</p><p>~~~~~~~~~</p><p><b>Wow! Sorry for the very long post, but hurray my first Game of Thrones imagine! I hoped you liked it! Sorry that it was a sad ending. My fingers wouldn&rsquo;t stop typing and I got carried away, but it&rsquo;s Game of Thrones. Happy ending doesn&rsquo;t exactly, you know, happen. But all the same, I hope you enjoyed it. Don&rsquo;t be afraid to leave a request!</b></p>",

        "question": "Am I the only one that doubts that Joffrey was behind the assassination attempt on Bran?  I don't deny that Joffrey was a sadistic, murderous little shit when he was alive, but the details of the attempt, the aftermath of the attempt and the motivation for it, don't seem to fit with Joffrey's snobbish, saddistic or boastful personality.  Joffrey saying words to the effect that he is familiar with Valyrian steel does not necessarily tie him to the dagger used in the assassination attempt.",
        "answer": "<p>I have no doubt that you\u2019re not the only one who doesn\u2019t think Joffrey was responsible for the assassination attempt on Bran.</p><p>That said, I find the explanation that Joffrey did it plausible.</p><blockquote><p>He ought to have seen it long ago.

Although to be honest, even that isn\u2019t much of an excuse because Blood Raven seemed perfectly normal to me, albeit creepy. He didn\u2019t seem emotionally disconnected so I don\u2019t know why this choice was made in regards to Bran\u2019s character. Maybe it will pay off in some unforeseen way. One can only hope.\u00a0</p><p>On the whole, I\u2019d say they\u2019ve been pretty inconsistent with Bran\u2019s character and I don\u2019t think they have a great handle on his story. We know he will play a huge role in the War for the Dawn but people are scratching their heads at what that could be, aside from him being the Google of Winterfell. Part of it is that they probably want to save the endgame with WW as a huge twist but part, I suspect, is that they\u2019re not all that interested in Bran.\u00a0</p><p>If you look at Bran\u2019s story line, once he leaves Winterfell and particularly after the NW incident at Craster\u2019s keep, his arc is meandering and confusing, his character is stagnant and he\u2019s used as a exposition device for other stories (namely Jon\u2019s parentage reveal). Bran\u2019s story line in the books is steeped in symbolism, philosophical questions and being played out as a horror story (the Jojen paste being a prime example - one the show chose to eliminate). It doesn\u2019t mesh well with the Ds love for bombast and huge spectacle.\u00a0</p><p>Now, as to the reason behind Bran\u2019s interaction with Sansa \u2026 I think Bran took Sansa\u2019s amused comment as her not believing him and requiring further proof, hence him triggering her PTSD. It was meant to show not only Sansa that he was who he said he was but also show the audience his callousness in talking about that particular experience. It also added to the isolation Sansa felt through out season 7 and that was meant to increase the odds of her siding with LF in the audience\u2019s eyes. On a larger scale, it\u2019s sort of a strange thing but Sansa, the person who pushed for the reunion of her family the most, ends up being alienated from both Arya and Bran. Her only wholly positive relationship keeps being her relationship with Jon, which if Jonsa were to happen, would only increase the deep connection they have.\u00a0</p><p>Thanks for the ask!</p>",

We know he will play a huge role in the War for the Dawn but people are scratching their heads at what that could be, aside from him being the Google of Winterfell.

Bran\u2019s story line in the books is steeped in symbolism, philosophical questions and being played out as a horror story (the Jojen paste being a prime example - one the show chose to eliminate).

It was meant to show not only Sansa that he was who he said he was but also show the audience his callousness in talking about that particular experience. It also added to the isolation Sansa felt through out season 7 and that was meant to increase the odds of her siding with LF in the audience\u2019s eyes. On a larger scale, it\u2019s sort of a strange thing but Sansa, the person who pushed for the reunion of her family the most, ends up being alienated from both Arya and Bran. Her only wholly positive relationship keeps being her relationship with Jon, which if Jonsa were to happen, would only increase the deep connection they have.\u00a0</p><p>Thanks for the ask!</p>",
