Jungkook doesn\u2019t even know who V is but one thing for sure: he wants him dead. But little does he know what he\u2018s gotten himself into&hellip;</i></p><h2>Chapter Eight</h2><p>The wine tasted sweet on Jimin\u2018s lips as he downed his third glass that evening. He closed his eyes and smiled at the peaceful silence surrounding him. Yoongi had always been a quiet company, he listens and observes and is not someone to share a lot about himself. Jimin had immediately felt comfortable around him from the moment they started hanging out. </p><p>They ate the takeaway Yoongi had bought, in his small living room and were now quietly sitting across from each other drinking one glass after another. </p><p>\u201eYou look good when you smile.\u201c Yoongi suddenly broke the silence. Jimin opened his eyes to find the elder staring right at him. \u201eI should smile more often then.\u201c Jimin sighed and looked away before Yoongi could stare directly into his soul and read his mind. Jimin couldn\u2018t really remember the last time he was genuinely happy without any worries or doubts. \u201eThere\u2018s always a reason to smile&hellip;\u201c Jimin wanted to argue but the moment he looked at Yoongi, he knew he was right. He had his eyes closed and was humming an unfamiliar melody to himself with a wineglass in his right hand. </p><p>The small voice inside of Jimin was telling him to stop. He should stop staring at him like that, he should stop drinking, he should stop smiling like an idiot and most definitely he should stop doing what he was about to do. But the voice faded into nothing with another sip of the red liquid and Jimin leaned over the small dining table to put his lips on Yoongi\u2018s. </p><p>Suddenly everything went super fast. The humming stopped, the wineglass shattered next to them, Yoongi opened his eyes widely to stare at Jimin who was too shocked to even breathe. \u201eWhy did you kiss me?\u201c Jimin was brought back to reality by Yoongi\u2018s calm but angry voice. There was something in his eyes that terrified Jimin to the core. \u201eI- I&hellip; I\u2018m sorry!\u201c He moved away from Yoongi and looked around the living room frantically as if he could find the answer written somewhere on the walls. \u201eI think it\u2018s better if you leave\u201c, he said with a stern voice which made Jimin shiver from his head to his feet. He nodded weakly and ran out of the house as fast as he could leaving Yoongi behind without another word. </p><p>Jungkook had it all planned. He was sitting at his desk in his office with documents scattered all over it, trying to gather information for his <i>client</i> about, well, himself. After all, he had to pretend to be an actual investigator and if he didn\u2018t deliver something to V he would get suspicious rather quickly. Judging from his first meeting with him he knew V wasn\u2018t one to joke around but Jungkook didn\u2018t think of giving him any important information about himself. That\u2018s why he spent the evening at his office trying to find something he could deliver. </p><p>He messaged V to let him know that he was ready to meet up. The reply came an hour later telling him to meet him at the bar outside of town. Jungkook was about to leave his house when he saw Hoseok sleeping tightly in one of the guest rooms. He had allowed him to stay with him for a while until he had found a new place. But the story about how exactly he ended up here still remained a mystery to everyone but Jungkook respected that completely. </p><p>Half an hour later he was surrounded by loud music and people in a bar trying to locate V. After what felt like an eternity he found him sitting in the VIP corner with some guys. Jungkook recognized one of them as his bodyguard from last time. V\u2018s eyes were scanning the room with a stern expression on his face. Suddenly his eyes fell on Jungkook and had him rooted on his spot. There was a tingling feeling all over Jungkook\u2018s body but he didn\u2018t break eye contact even once. Jungkook\u2018s eyes traced down the young man, his dark brown hair styled perfectly to a mullet, his big brown eyes fixed on Jungkook and his lips pressed to a thin line. A short nod addressed Jungkook to come closer so he crossed the room and made his way up to the VIP lounge. Standing tall in front of V he could feel the power he held but didn\u2018t feel threatened at all. \u201eI have something for you\u201c, Jungkook shouted to be heard over the music. V raised his eyebrows and looked at his bodyguard. \u201eSehun, I think I can handle this on my own.\u201c He stood up and told Jungkook to follow him ignoring the protest of his bodyguard. </p><p>He led them to a separate room with only a table and some chairs. V sat across Jungkook folding his hands and looking expectantly at Jungkook. \u201eLet\u2018s see what you got here&hellip;\u201c </p><p>Jungkook sighed leaning forward to look directly into V\u2018s dark eyes. \u201eI couldn\u2018t find out that much but did you ever wonder about how exactly Jungkook landed on the streets?\u201c</p><p>Even though Jungkook didn\u2018t like the idea of sharing his story with a stranger and especially not with him he decided that it was the only safe thing to tell without having to fear any consequences. \u201eI guess I\u2018ll find out soon.\u201c V\u2018s deep voice interrupted his thoughts and he nodded. </p><p>Jungkook inhaled deeply still ringing with himself if he should just quit but with a feeling of uncertainty he began talking. \u201eSo&hellip;\u201c</p><p><b>Flashback</b></p><p><i>It was dark and dusty under his bed and Jungkook was hoping it would swallow him completely so he wouldn\u2018t have to be there anymore. He could still hear the loud noises downstairs even though he had both of his hands pressed against his ears. He knew he should be used to it by now but the panic he felt only got worse as time passed. The worst thing was they had completely forgotten about their 15-year-old son. The didn\u2019t notice how bad his grades were getting, how he started hanging out with some shady people he met on the street the other day and they didn\u2019t notice how late he\u2019d been coming home late. There was only one explanation: they didn\u2018t care, at all. </i></p><p><i>Suddenly the noises stopped and the whole house got eerily quiet. Jungkook removed his hands to listen if his parents were still there. He slowly crawled out from under his bed and moved towards the staircase. Still no sound. Just when he was about to enter the kitchen he heard his mom\u2019s annoyed voice. </i></p><p><i>\u201eWhere is that failure of a son we have?\u201c Then he could hear his dad answer in an equally pissed tone. \u201eIf I\u2018d known he\u2018d turn out to be this much of a headache I wouldn\u2018t have agreed to adopt him in the first place.\u201c Jungkook stopped dead in his tracks eyes wide open waiting for them to say something else. Anything to let him know that they were joking and that they still loved him as their son. But they only started to argue about whose fault it was to have adopted him. Jungkook couldn\u2018t hear them anymore. He slowly backed away almost tripping over his own feet his mind still spinning around the words he had just heard. </i></p><p>\u201eThey are not my parents. They don\u2019t want me.\u201c <i>He kept repeating the words over and over again. Jungkook ran upstairs threw everything he needed into a sports bag and grabbed his piggy bank with the money he had saved for years. He didn\u2018t know where exactly he would go but he knew he had to disappear for good. He looked around his room one last time trying to fight back the tears. Quietly he made his way downstairs walking past the kitchen to the front door, his parents still too busy screaming at each other to notice anything. He closed the door behind him and ran away into the night&hellip;</i></p><p>Once he finished explaining the story in a few sentences he waited for a reaction from V. But he was still sitting there with his hands folded in his lap and the same cold expression he always had. Jungkook wondered if there was anything that could make V let his guard down even for a split second. \u201eGood job, Kook. But how did you get this information? I\u2018ve been trying for so long to find something useful.\u201c Jungkook leaned back with a smug expression on his face. \u201eThat\u2018s professional secrecy. Sorry, but I can\u2018t tell you that.\u201c  V smiled lightly at Jungkook who almost choked at the sight. It was the first time V showed he had emotions too like every other human being. \u201eI\u2018d like to keep you around, you could be of great use for my team.\u201c</p><h2><a href=\"https://bts-fantasy.tumblr.com/post/182980071733/danger-taekook-au-this-town-is-not-big-enough-for\">MASTERLIST</a></h2>",

Jungkook doesn\u2019t even know who V is but one thing for sure: he wants him dead. But little does he know what he\u2018s gotten himself into\u2026</i></p><h2>Chapter Eight</h2><p>The wine tasted sweet on Jimin\u2018s lips as he downed his third glass that evening. He closed his eyes and smiled at the peaceful silence surrounding him. Yoongi had always been a quiet company, he listens and observes and is not someone to share a lot about himself. Jimin had immediately felt comfortable around him from the moment they started hanging out. </p><p>They ate the takeaway Yoongi had bought, in his small living room and were now quietly sitting across from each other drinking one glass after another. </p><p>\u201eYou look good when you smile.\u201c Yoongi suddenly broke the silence. Jimin opened his eyes to find the elder staring right at him. \u201eI should smile more often then.\u201c Jimin sighed and looked away before Yoongi could stare directly into his soul and read his mind. Jimin couldn\u2018t really remember the last time he was genuinely happy without any worries or doubts. \u201eThere\u2018s always a reason to smile\u2026\u201c Jimin wanted to argue but the moment he looked at Yoongi, he knew he was right. He had his eyes closed and was humming an unfamiliar melody to himself with a wineglass in his right hand. </p><p>The small voice inside of Jimin was telling him to stop. He should stop staring at him like that, he should stop drinking, he should stop smiling like an idiot and most definitely he should stop doing what he was about to do. But the voice faded into nothing with another sip of the red liquid and Jimin leaned over the small dining table to put his lips on Yoongi\u2018s. </p><p>Suddenly everything went super fast. The humming stopped, the wineglass shattered next to them, Yoongi opened his eyes widely to stare at Jimin who was too shocked to even breathe. \u201eWhy did you kiss me?\u201c Jimin was brought back to reality by Yoongi\u2018s calm but angry voice. There was something in his eyes that terrified Jimin to the core. \u201eI- I\u2026 I\u2018m sorry!\u201c He moved away from Yoongi and looked around the living room frantically as if he could find the answer written somewhere on the walls. \u201eI think it\u2018s better if you leave\u201c, he said with a stern voice which made Jimin shiver from his head to his feet. He nodded weakly and ran out of the house as fast as he could leaving Yoongi behind without another word. </p><p>Jungkook had it all planned. He was sitting at his desk in his office with documents scattered all over it, trying to gather information for his <i>client</i> about, well, himself. After all, he had to pretend to be an actual investigator and if he didn\u2018t deliver something to V he would get suspicious rather quickly. Judging from his first meeting with him he knew V wasn\u2018t one to joke around but Jungkook didn\u2018t think of giving him any important information about himself. That\u2018s why he spent the evening at his office trying to find something he could deliver. </p><p>He messaged V to let him know that he was ready to meet up. The reply came an hour later telling him to meet him at the bar outside of town. Jungkook was about to leave his house when he saw Hoseok sleeping tightly in one of the guest rooms. He had allowed him to stay with him for a while until he had found a new place. But the story about how exactly he ended up here still remained a mystery to everyone but Jungkook respected that completely. </p><p>Half an hour later he was surrounded by loud music and people in a bar trying to locate V. After what felt like an eternity he found him sitting in the VIP corner with some guys. Jungkook recognized one of them as his bodyguard from last time. V\u2018s eyes were scanning the room with a stern expression on his face. Suddenly his eyes fell on Jungkook and had him rooted on his spot. There was a tingling feeling all over Jungkook\u2018s body but he didn\u2018t break eye contact even once. Jungkook\u2018s eyes traced down the young man, his dark brown hair styled perfectly to a mullet, his big brown eyes fixed on Jungkook and his lips pressed to a thin line. A short nod addressed Jungkook to come closer so he crossed the room and made his way up to the VIP lounge. Standing tall in front of V he could feel the power he held but didn\u2018t feel threatened at all. \u201eI have something for you\u201c, Jungkook shouted to be heard over the music. V raised his eyebrows and looked at his bodyguard. \u201eSehun, I think I can handle this on my own.\u201c He stood up and told Jungkook to follow him ignoring the protest of his bodyguard. </p><p>He led them to a separate room with only a table and some chairs. V sat across Jungkook folding his hands and looking expectantly at Jungkook. \u201eLet\u2018s see what you got here\u2026\u201c </p><p>Jungkook sighed leaning forward to look directly into V\u2018s dark eyes. \u201eI couldn\u2018t find out that much but did you ever wonder about how exactly Jungkook landed on the streets?\u201c</p><p>Even though Jungkook didn\u2018t like the idea of sharing his story with a stranger and especially not with him he decided that it was the only safe thing to tell without having to fear any consequences. \u201eI guess I\u2018ll find out soon.\u201c V\u2018s deep voice interrupted his thoughts and he nodded. </p><p>Jungkook inhaled deeply still ringing with himself if he should just quit but with a feeling of uncertainty he began talking. \u201eSo\u2026\u201c</p><p><b>Flashback</b></p><p><i>It was dark and dusty under his bed and Jungkook was hoping it would swallow him completely so he wouldn\u2018t have to be there anymore. He could still hear the loud noises downstairs even though he had both of his hands pressed against his ears. He knew he should be used to it by now but the panic he felt only got worse as time passed. The worst thing was they had completely forgotten about their 15-year-old son. The didn\u2019t notice how bad his grades were getting, how he started hanging out with some shady people he met on the street the other day and they didn\u2019t notice how late he\u2019d been coming home late. There was only one explanation: they didn\u2018t care, at all. </i></p><p><i>Suddenly the noises stopped and the whole house got eerily quiet. Jungkook removed his hands to listen if his parents were still there. He slowly crawled out from under his bed and moved towards the staircase. Still no sound. Just when he was about to enter the kitchen he heard his mom\u2019s annoyed voice. </i></p><p><i>\u201eWhere is that failure of a son we have?\u201c Then he could hear his dad answer in an equally pissed tone. \u201eIf I\u2018d known he\u2018d turn out to be this much of a headache I wouldn\u2018t have agreed to adopt him in the first place.\u201c Jungkook stopped dead in his tracks eyes wide open waiting for them to say something else. Anything to let him know that they were joking and that they still loved him as their son. But they only started to argue about whose fault it was to have adopted him. Jungkook couldn\u2018t hear them anymore. He slowly backed away almost tripping over his own feet his mind still spinning around the words he had just heard. </i></p><p>\u201eThey are not my parents. They don\u2019t want me.\u201c <i>He kept repeating the words over and over again. Jungkook ran upstairs threw everything he needed into a sports bag and grabbed his piggy bank with the money he had saved for years. He didn\u2018t know where exactly he would go but he knew he had to disappear for good. He looked around his room one last time trying to fight back the tears. Quietly he made his way downstairs walking past the kitchen to the front door, his parents still too busy screaming at each other to notice anything. He closed the door behind him and ran away into the night\u2026</i></p><p>Once he finished explaining the story in a few sentences he waited for a reaction from V. But he was still sitting there with his hands folded in his lap and the same cold expression he always had. Jungkook wondered if there was anything that could make V let his guard down even for a split second. \u201eGood job, Kook. But how did you get this information? I\u2018ve been trying for so long to find something useful.\u201c Jungkook leaned back with a smug expression on his face. \u201eThat\u2018s professional secrecy. Sorry, but I can\u2018t tell you that.\u201c  V smiled lightly at Jungkook who almost choked at the sight. It was the first time V showed he had emotions too like every other human being. \u201eI\u2018d like to keep you around, you could be of great use for my team.\u201c</p><h2><a href=\"https://bts-fantasy.tumblr.com/post/182980071733/danger-taekook-au-this-town-is-not-big-enough-for\">MASTERLIST</a></h2></p>",
