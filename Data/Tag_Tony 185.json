More than any of the other Avengers, you had been taking laps for exercise while the others preferred the gym for their workouts. You did not mind, and even though Tony had paid only heaven knows how much for the renovation that had been taken place for a few weeks now, he did not seem to mind neither. Really, he was just happy you were enjoying what you had been needing for so long.</p><!-- more --><p>You had mentioned more than once how difficult it was to exercise and uphold the unique skill set you had obtained through your former position in the Frogman Corps back, as an immense part of the training you had undergone while serving your country dealt with water. Now, with being an Avenger, jumping into the ocean to do breath stabilization training exercises was no longer an option. Tony seemed more than keen to provide you with this one thing, as you did not take up much space prior to this.</p><p>Truth be told, you were not the most valuable asset to the team. You could not fly, neither could you crawl on buildings nor swing from skyscraper to another. Neither were you the only team member who had undergone standard military training, however, when it came to eliminating the threat before it could cause damage, you were the pearl on the team. No one liked a blow in the back when fighting off bad guys, so that\u2019s when they appreciated you lying on a rooftop or a creek, taking them down from your hiding one after one, completely unnoticed.</p><p>You had gotten impeccable aim from your father who had brought you along on his hunting trips when you were the innocent age of 8 and decided to join the military and over the course of 13 years, you became the best sniper in the Royal Army. Along with friends meant to last a lifetime, you received\u00a0several medals over time and were soon decorated in ribbon and medallions. The threat, of course, grew aware of the upper hand with such a good shot, and the first bounty on your head surfaced only four years into your service at an amount of 70K.</p><p>Enemies were then aware of your name and knew it to be feared, for providing excellent service for your country you were protected as any other military personnel, and the only chances that were taken on claiming that bounty were the failed attempts of dying men. For many years you watched more and more excellent marksmen and sharpshooters conduct superior work, and the prize on your head went up to roughly 900K dollars. That was when you decided it was time to move on and after a series of tough nine months, you were in the special force of the\u00a0Frogman Corps.</p><p>And <i>that</i>\u00a0was how you found your way into a portion of recommendation letters from the executive committee; with high acclaim scripted by one and only Thaddeus Ross. Even though the Avengers officially had no say in the matter of who to recruit for the team, all papers went by the office in the New Avengers Facility and James Rhodes seemed much delighted you had a future with the Avengers.\u00a0</p><p>As the aftermath of a couple of meetings, scheduled appointments to show off your techniques \u2013 really just for the fun of it for Tony \u2013 you found yourself with an offer impossible to decline.</p><p>You operated with the Avengers and fought to take down H.A.M.M.E.R. The temporary alignment was not meant to stand longer than needed, but Tony Stark was utterly impressed with your contribution and wanted you to join forces after your stunning performance. Things had been running quietly, heading on missions rarely as the accords estranged the name of the Avengers. Tony had warned you he was not the one pulling the strings and the team merely got deployed when most necessary, so other than the infrequent battles thriving on absolute chaos, the Avengers facility was composed.</p><p>Even though the standard military training you had undergone gave you a significant advantage when fighting bad guys, your skills became most useful when it came to <g class=\"gr_ gr_146 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Grammar only-ins doubleReplace replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"146\" data-gr-id=\"146\">knowledge</g> of marine machinery and pretty much all missions carried out underwater. On the contrary to what one might think, now the team had you, it was hard for them to apprehend how the had carried on for this long without you.<br/></p><p>Although you had been with the Avengers for almost a year, Tony was afraid you were not feeling home yet, as when not on assigned missions kicking ass from underwater, your only role was cooking up a delicious meal every now and then.</p><p>When Tony set foot in the sturdy, huge room he was instantly calmed by tranquil waves in the water and quiet sounds of occasional, low splashes. Taking notice of your wavy figure in the water, he smiled to himself and walked around the pool to meet you at the end.<br/></p><p>You resurfaced and sucked in a deep, long breath, relishing the air filling your lungs. When opening your eyes, you blinked the water from the lashes and smiled delighted up at Tony, and rested your arms on the brim.</p><p>&ldquo;Glad to see you&rsquo;re enjoying the pool,\u201d he said, voice resounding as it bounced off the walls.\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re hiding an awful lot down here.\u201d</p><p>&quot;Just exercising.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That and developing gills,\u201d\u00a0he quipped and crouched down in front of you.</p><p>\u201cWell, it <i>is</i> a very nice pool. Almost too much space for just me,\u201d you appreciated and back a tad away from the brim to get a better look at him.<br/></p><p>He shrugged and clicked his tongue as you watched his reflecting eyes.\u00a0\u201cIt was just a minor instalment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m very thankful,\u201d you grinned at his humble statement and shook your head.\u00a0\u201cWhy don\u2019t you join me?\u201d</p><p>He pulled a face.\u00a0\u201cMe? No.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Why not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI&hellip;\u00a0am not dressed for it?\u201d he spoke as if he had come up with a valid excuse. You figured from the way his words came uncertain, he was convincing himself more than you.<br/></p><p>\u201cDressed?\u201d you chuckled and splashed some water around, as you kept yourself up with your arms.\u00a0\u201cNo need for that. You got out of your way to install a damn pool, at least try it out,\u201d you pleaded and tilted your head, the playing smirk still curling your lip to a point it made Tony hard. Good thing he was crouching, so the bulge was not as visible.</p><p>He was already convinced, but the look on your face was something he did not want to see fade.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ll look away.\u201d</p><p>Tony laughed aloud. <i>As if there was any need for that</i>.

It was no lie, Tony was not the tallest of tall and if you were not wrong, he did not appreciate always having to look up to other people. However, in your opinion he seemed just the perfect size, knowing if you were gonna make your move on him at some point, he was not the kind you would have to stand on toes to reach. You were perfectly fine with that. \u201cYou\u2019re just not very big.

Though his respect was something most people were offered out of simple politeness, it took some to gain his trust.

More than any of the other Avengers, you had been taking laps for exercise while the others preferred the gym for their workouts. You did not mind, and even though Tony had paid only heaven knows how much for the renovation that had been taken place for a few weeks now, he did not seem to mind neither. Really, he was just happy you were enjoying what you had been needing for so long.</p><p>You had mentioned more than once how difficult it was to exercise and uphold the unique skill set you had obtained through your former position in the Frogman Corps back, as an immense part of the training you had undergone while serving your country dealt with water. Now, with being an Avenger, jumping into the ocean to do breath stabilization training exercises was no longer an option. Tony seemed more than keen to provide you with this one thing, as you did not take up much space prior to this.</p><p>Truth be told, you were not the most valuable asset to the team. You could not fly, neither could you crawl on buildings nor swing from skyscraper to another. Neither were you the only team member who had undergone standard military training, however, when it came to eliminating the threat before it could cause damage, you were the pearl on the team. No one liked a blow in the back when fighting off bad guys, so that&rsquo;s when they appreciated you lying on a rooftop or a creek, taking them down from your hiding one after one, completely unnoticed.</p><p>You had gotten impeccable aim from your father who had brought you along on his hunting trips when you were the innocent age of 8 and decided to join the military and over the course of 13 years, you became the best sniper in the Royal Army. Along with friends meant to last a lifetime, you received&nbsp;several medals over time and were soon decorated in ribbon and medallions. The threat, of course, grew aware of the upper hand with such a good shot, and the first bounty on your head surfaced only four years into your service at an amount of 70K.</p><p>Enemies were then aware of your name and knew it to be feared, for providing excellent service for your country you were protected as any other military personnel, and the only chances that were taken on claiming that bounty were the failed attempts of dying men. For many years you watched more and more excellent marksmen and sharpshooters conduct superior work, and the prize on your head went up to roughly 900K dollars. That was when you decided it was time to move on and after a series of tough nine months, you were in the special force of the&nbsp;Frogman Corps.</p><p>And <i>that</i>&nbsp;was how you found your way into a portion of recommendation letters from the executive committee; with high acclaim scripted by one and only Thaddeus Ross. Even though the Avengers officially had no say in the matter of who to recruit for the team, all papers went by the office in the New Avengers Facility and James Rhodes seemed much delighted you had a future with the Avengers.&nbsp;</p><p>As the aftermath of a couple of meetings, scheduled appointments to show off your techniques &ndash; really just for the fun of it for Tony &ndash; you found yourself with an offer impossible to decline.</p><p>You operated with the Avengers and fought to take down H.A.M.M.E.R. The temporary alignment was not meant to stand longer than needed, but Tony Stark was utterly impressed with your contribution and wanted you to join forces after your stunning performance. Things had been running quietly, heading on missions rarely as the accords estranged the name of the Avengers. Tony had warned you he was not the one pulling the strings and the team merely got deployed when most necessary, so other than the infrequent battles thriving on absolute chaos, the Avengers facility was composed.</p><p>Even though the standard military training you had undergone gave you a significant advantage when fighting bad guys, your skills became most useful when it came to knowledge of marine machinery and pretty much all missions carried out underwater. On the contrary to what one might think, now the team had you, it was hard for them to apprehend how the had carried on for this long without you.<br /></p><p>Although you had been with the Avengers for almost a year, Tony was afraid you were not feeling home yet, as when not on assigned missions kicking ass from underwater, your only role was cooking up a delicious meal every now and then.</p><p>When Tony set foot in the sturdy, huge room he was instantly calmed by tranquil waves in the water and quiet sounds of occasional, low splashes. Taking notice of your wavy figure in the water, he smiled to himself and walked around the pool to meet you at the end.<br /></p><p>You resurfaced and sucked in a deep, long breath, relishing the air filling your lungs. When opening your eyes, you blinked the water from the lashes and smiled delighted up at Tony, and rested your arms on the brim.</p><p>&ldquo;Glad to see you&rsquo;re enjoying the pool,&rdquo; he said, voice resounding as it bounced off the walls.&nbsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;re hiding an awful lot down here.&rdquo;</p><p>\"Just exercising.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That and developing gills,&rdquo;&nbsp;he quipped and crouched down in front of you.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, it <i>is</i> a very nice pool. Almost too much space for just me,&rdquo; you appreciated and back a tad away from the brim to get a better look at him.<br /></p><p>He shrugged and clicked his tongue as you watched his reflecting eyes.&nbsp;&ldquo;It was just a minor instalment.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m very thankful,&rdquo; you grinned at his humble statement and shook your head.&nbsp;&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you join me?&rdquo;</p><p>He pulled a face.&nbsp;&ldquo;Me? No.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What? Why not?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&hellip;&nbsp;am not dressed for it?&rdquo; he spoke as if he had come up with a valid excuse. You figured from the way his words came uncertain, he was convincing himself more than you.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Dressed?&rdquo; you chuckled and splashed some water around, as you kept yourself up with your arms.&nbsp;&ldquo;No need for that. You got out of your way to install a damn pool, at least try it out,&rdquo; you pleaded and tilted your head, the playing smirk still curling your lip to a point it made Tony hard. Good thing he was crouching, so the bulge was not as visible.</p><p>He was already convinced, but the look on your face was something he did not want to see fade.&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll look away.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony laughed aloud. <i>As if there was any need for that</i>. When he stood up with his eyes still fixated, you grinned and swam further back, turning when you saw his hands got for the neck of his shirt.</p><p>It was not long until you heard a light splash and you turned back around, circling him with no worry.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t&ndash;don&rsquo;t do that, I&rsquo;m getting nauseous.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Shut up,&rdquo; you chuckled and got a tad closer.&nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nice, don&rsquo;t you think?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m really not much of a swimmer, but yeah. Sure. Can you touch the bottom?&rdquo; asked Tony, not sure if it was too deep.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo; He made an&nbsp;&ldquo;oh&rdquo; sound and you grinned at him, swimming closer.

It\u2019s pointless to indulge\nin such thoughts \u2013 she won\u2019t be moving from where she is now any time\nsoon. \u00a0Because where she is now is the\nonly place wide enough in this cramped little pod where she could sit down with\nTony cradled securely in her armored embrace, and she is not about to allow\nherself to be parted from him. Not after everything. Not anymore.</p><p>She had retracted the armor the moment they settled down, gently\ntightening her hold on Tony when his unconscious form slipped further into her\nembrace once the additional bulk of the armor was gone. \u00a0She needed to touch him, to feel him solid and\nalive against her skin. \u00a0But he feels so\ncold, so cold. \u00a0</p><p>She hoists him up higher in her lap, trying to be as gentle\nas she possibly can, terrified that she would hurt him, would break him\nsomehow. \u00a0Because he looks so fragile, so\nthin \u2013 ethereal almost, like he could disappear at any moment, could crumble to\nstardust in her arms. \u00a0</p><p>The thought makes her shiver, and she cocoons her body\naround him as if to shield him from the universe itself, to give him as much of\nher warmth as she can, ignoring the way her back twinges in protest. \u00a0</p><p>He still feels cold.</p><!-- more --><p><i>&ndash;\u201c\u2026lucky.\u201d&ndash;</i></p><p>She thought they were too late. \u00a0When they stepped inside that spaceship \u2013\nthat cold, airless tomb, a black void of death amidst the apathetic, starry beauty\nof the cosmos, she thought they were too late.</p><p>And then she saw him \u2013 ghostly pale and lifeless, slumped\nragdoll-like against a blue-skinned one-eyed woman, and she became convinced\nthat they were.</p><p>But then the woman moved, sensing their approach, shifted as\nthough to protect him, and a new rush of hope made Pepper\u2019s knees go weak.</p><p>\u201cHis oxygen is almost out,\u201d the woman rasped, when Pepper\ndropped down beside him, retracting her gauntlets and helmet despite the urgent\nflash of warning on the HUD. \u00a0</p><p>She could handle a few moments without oxygen. \u00a0She wanted to see with her own eyes the\nfeeble rise and fall of his chest. \u00a0She wanted\nto touch his face. \u00a0 She wanted\u2026 she\nneeded\u2026 she\u2026</p><p>\u201cYou need to hurry.\u201d</p><p><i>Yes, that.</i></p><p><i>\u00a0</i></p><p>Gingerly she slipped her arms under Tony, pulling him in,\npulling him up with her. \u00a0Moved to rush\nback toward the pod.</p><p>\u201cMy team?\u201d Rocket\u2019s sudden, desperation tinged growl stopped\nher in her tracks.</p><p><i>Oh no\u2026</i></p><p><i>\u00a0</i></p><p>She watched the woman stumble weakly to her feet, one hand\nbraced on the bulkhead. \u00a0Watched her shake\nher head with an expression of muted regret. \n\u201cDust,\u201d she said, her voice as hollow as the look in her eye. \u00a0Then her expression twisted, morphing into\nsomething uglier, something deadly. \u00a0\u201cExcept\nGamora. \u00a0He killed Gamora.\u201d</p><p>The raccoon stiffened, eyes wide, mouth opening and closing\nin quick, convulsive bursts. And then sound burst through \u2013 an awful keening\nnoise that echoed through the empty bowels of the ship like a death knell,\nmaking the darkness slither in closer, its icy breath seeming to filter past\nthe suit\u2019s defenses, making her shiver.</p><p>\u201cRocket,\u201d she begged, forcing herself not to flinch away\nfrom him as he turned his grief-blackened eyes toward her, his little body\ntrembling with the force of emotions that she understood all too well. \u00a0\u201cPlease, we gotta go.
