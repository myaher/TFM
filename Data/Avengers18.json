That family it&rsquo;s not a weakness it&rsquo;s a safe place. </p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"chat\"}'><b>Natasha:</b> she taught me to shape myself to be what I need to be for myself, to be the best for myself, because at the end of the day I am the only one I can trust and only I have my own back all the time. She taught me what sacrifice means. I have to be strong for myself and for how much be indipendent and strong is a value, have soft spots and have fear it&rsquo;s part of the process.

He taught me that we can be so fucked up, to feel like everything we do it&rsquo;s wrong and not because we&rsquo;re making a mistake but because think we are broken, demaged or cursed, or to think that everyone will be just fine without us around, that we are only a waste of time, and STILL wake up every sigle day and fight our demons, and punch them so hard in the face, kick their asses so bad that they&rsquo;ll think twice before came back to bother us again. He taught me how to be true to my emotions, to not fake it, not make it worse, to speak my mind and my heart. That be good at something, to enjoy or be passionate about something it&rsquo;s just the best feeling in life. If life gives you pain and lemons, make a fricking flying robot made of lemons and go kick the world in the butt.</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"chat\"}'><b>Thor:</b> Thor taught me to be kind and compassionate, that everyone have a story to tell and a war that they&rsquo;re fighting, so be sure to be kind. He taught me that love it&rsquo;s something bigger than the galaxies, even if sometimes it&rsquo;s hard to understand or painful, even if sometimes we fell for the wrong person or for the idea of have them by our side, just for not be alone. But he taught me the difference between be alone and feel lonely. To love someone unconditionally, in the bad and good times, and that the love and the affection between siblings even if can be harsh or distant it&rsquo;s still hide in the deep and it only need a little bit more of time to grow up.</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"chat\"}'><b>Steve:</b> Steve taught me to be loyal, to be honest and to stand still in frame, to plant my feet on the ground like a tree and stand up for what it&rsquo;s right, to protect and defend what it&rsquo;s important to me and to have no afraid to get hurt, because sometimes we just refuse to do something only for the fear to get hurt or to mess up everything, the blood or the mess can be wiped away. We can start again, life don&rsquo;t start and finish with us, life goes on and on and death takes and takes without asking you the permission, so we have to be sharp and do what we need and want to do, whatever it takes.</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"chat\"}'><b>Bruce:</b> Bruce taught me that be shy or insicure it&rsquo;s not a weakness, sometimes it&rsquo;s just a shield, an invisible protective shield, and to be patient, to value my feelings and not rush into situations or relationships only because they makes me feel good, to have doubts, to over-think if need, to take my time to value every possibilities, the pro and cons, to take my time and find my own rhythm, because be alert it&rsquo;s so underrated. He taught me that people cares so much about how you look, how you act, your attitude and how you speak your mind, and that we just have to live your life like if only the things that make you feel good are the only things that really matters. </p>",

                "content": "<p><h1>things the avengers taught me:</h1><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf=\"{&quot;subtype&quot;:&quot;chat&quot;}\"><b>Clint:</b> Clint taught me to be true to myself, to not change to please the others, people can love you or not, they can think you are making the worst mistakes of your life, but you have to stay true to yourself and stand for what you think it&rsquo;s worth and right and if need fight the world. That family it&rsquo;s not a weakness it&rsquo;s a safe place. </p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf=\"{&quot;subtype&quot;:&quot;chat&quot;}\"><b>Natasha:</b> she taught me to shape myself to be what I need to be for myself, to be the best for myself, because at the end of the day I am the only one I can trust and only I have my own back all the time. She taught me what sacrifice means. I have to be strong for myself and for how much be indipendent and strong is a value, have soft spots and have fear it&rsquo;s part of the process. She taught me to have faith and that family it&rsquo;s not DNA.</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf=\"{&quot;subtype&quot;:&quot;chat&quot;}\"><b>Tony:</b> &ldquo;The only way in it&rsquo;s through&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t really know why, but every time I read this quote I think about Tony and about how much he had to go through. He taught me that we can be so fucked up, to feel like everything we do it&rsquo;s wrong and not because we&rsquo;re making a mistake but because think we are broken, demaged or cursed, or to think that everyone will be just fine without us around, that we are only a waste of time, and STILL wake up every sigle day and fight our demons, and punch them so hard in the face, kick their asses so bad that they&rsquo;ll think twice before came back to bother us again. He taught me how to be true to my emotions, to not fake it, not make it worse, to speak my mind and my heart. That be good at something, to enjoy or be passionate about something it&rsquo;s just the best feeling in life. If life gives you pain and lemons, make a fricking flying robot made of lemons and go kick the world in the butt.</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf=\"{&quot;subtype&quot;:&quot;chat&quot;}\"><b>Thor:</b> Thor taught me to be kind and compassionate, that everyone have a story to tell and a war that they&rsquo;re fighting, so be sure to be kind. He taught me that love it&rsquo;s something bigger than the galaxies, even if sometimes it&rsquo;s hard to understand or painful, even if sometimes we fell for the wrong person or for the idea of have them by our side, just for not be alone. But he taught me the difference between be alone and feel lonely.
