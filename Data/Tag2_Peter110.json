I don&rsquo;t know. find that yourself after reading. Love you all! Request are open :)</i></p><p>From the orange-tinged sky, Tony pushed that square piece of metal towards Thanos, crushing him under it and making tornados of dust. However, the villain&rsquo;s last words stole your breath while the serum in your veins froze inside you remembering the explosion you caused in that facility, burying everyone on the way: how you killed those people&hellip; And suddenly, while Quill ambushed Thanos like Drax and the others, the memory of that night fell on you like a spell, freezing you there, not able to move even when they worked together to stop Thanos with Stranger&rsquo;s spell, Drax&rsquo;s muscles, Mantis powers, Peter&rsquo;s web or Tony&rsquo;s strength. \u00a0</p><p>\u201c(y/n) don\u2019t listen to him, Darling.\u201d Tony said with a soft voice, despite his jaw clenched by the force he used trying to take the gauntlet from Thanos. &ldquo;What happened that night was not your fault, they forced you to do it. They hurt you, they pushed you to do what you did.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What I did&hellip;&rdquo; You whispered, looking up from the floor and towards him, showing the tears you couldn\u2019t hide.</p><p>Tony shook his head, in an attempt to make you see that it wasn\u2019t your fault.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Darlin\u2019, I need your help.\u201d</p><p>However, it was Quill who was able to free himself from the paralysis that caused him to hear that Gamora had died. Thanos&rsquo;s sadness in his semi-unconscious state unleashed the anger inside Quill, since he considered him false, selfish, and a real murderer, so he hit him with his gun, again and again, screaming with frustration the pain in his soul for the loss of his beloved, ruining the plan when they almost had the battle won. When Thanos awoke from the spell, his powers that were superior were defeating each of the superheroes, pushing them away with a punch or fainting them with the power of the gauntlet. To all but you, as if he had an interest in you and in what you did.</p><p>&ldquo;I know your story, dear. The pain and death you caused and your desire to remedy what you did. Why do you fight against me if you can let me do this without causing any pain? &quot;A few steps from you, he looked directly into your eyes, with some peace under the cold of the battle. &quot;You can cause a catastrophe on earth. I can see the power within you, I can see the fear in your eyes. Join me, my dear, let me do my job&hellip; I promise that your mother could have a godly death.&rdquo;</p><p>You gave a strong inhalation when you heard about your mom, but even on that planet, the air wasn&rsquo;t enough to fill the void in your lungs.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey! Leave her alone, asshole!&rdquo;</p><p>Tony flew over him, hitting hard the arm that Thanos extended in your direction. But the villain was stronger than everyone and the battle between them was short-lived when he pushed Tony with a strong blow. While the avenger fell to the ground, Thanos used the power of the gauntlet to move a moon that floated in the sky, shedding meteorites of rock that he launched with an arrow speed towards the planet.</p><p>Tony, behind his Iron Man mask, and you, held the other&rsquo;s gaze for a few seconds before he flew over the moon to stop it, trusting that you would use that great power within you, to help him save the others.</p><p><b><i>\u2014\u2014\u201cAvengers: Far from home.\u201d\u2014\u2014</i></b>  </p><p>Protected by a big force field that shone under a white light, the world shook under that great explosion and turned everything into view in a thick sandstorm. With one knee bent against the ground to stabilize yourself, the mist had vanished just like the shield as you stood up, turning around when you felt a hand on your shoulder. Half of Peter&rsquo;s body fell on you, kneeling on the ground next to you, without his mask to breathe better. The only one awake among the bodies of Quill, Mantis, Drax and Nebula, to whom Thanos had fainted with the power of the gauntlet.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re okay&hellip; Yeah, you&rsquo;re okay.&rdquo; He breathed raggedly, smiling barely, as he looked up to see you better while you stared at him. It wasn&rsquo;t a question, but a confirmation. In that moment of complete astonishment on your part, Peter ignored Tony&rsquo;s words and raised a trembling hand to rest it on your cheek, gently. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re good a person, okay? Don&rsquo;t forget it.&rdquo;</p><p>You held your breath, avoiding making any movement, because maybe in that way, your body would miss the contact with another person and how dangerous it could be. But you, in that moment, tried to quiet the voice in your head that said how dangerous you were, just to keep him close to you.</p><p>If Peter was about to make another move or not, an explosion far away from you distracted you both, but as you tried to get up, Peter couldn&rsquo;t, keeping you on the ground.</p><p>&ldquo;Tony needs help&hellip;&rdquo; You said, part of you distrusting if you could help him. &ldquo;Stay here, Peter. You will be fine.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;ll go too.&rdquo; He tried to get up, still with his hands on your arms, but it was as if the force of a magnet pushed him back to the ground with a pain inside his body.</p><p>It was then that reality hit you, and you shook your head, because you refused to believe it.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s me. I&rsquo;m doing this to you.&rdquo;</p><p>You gently pushed his arms away from you to get up and stop hurting him, because that&rsquo;s what you were doing; It was you who was taking away his strength. Peter looked disoriented as he stood up as well, looking at you, not understanding how you could do that.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to be bad, Peter, but I&rsquo;m not good either.&rdquo;</p><p>The sadness in your voice hit Peter&rsquo;s heart, because he could see through you, because he thought you were good, but it was your fear that didn&rsquo;t let you see your true self, your past had covered your eyes, like if your mind were another person inside you, convincing you with a lie.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go, please&hellip;&rdquo; Peter tried to take a step towards you, forcing you to give one back. &ldquo;Stop running away, (y/n). Let me prove you&rsquo;re good.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&hellip;&rdquo; Peter denied, but there was no absolute fear on his face. On the contrary, his eyes seemed to shine with the hope of finding a solution. &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter if you keep pushing me away for fear of hurting me, I will stay with you until we find a solution. I promise.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter came up to you, while the bravery in his eyes caused something in you to break down. The infinite desire to be who you used to be made your soul go through that wall that you created around you to protect others, because only then you would protect yourself from causing another pain, but it but collapsed to your feet when his hands held your face, fighting at first against the pain that your body began to exhale as a defense mechanism. But as you tried to use your hands to push him away from you, they clung to his arms the moment he pressed his lips against yours.</p><p>Despite the fear that brought tears to your closed eyes, you stayed there, waiting. Inside, you fought against that painful power that ran through your body, against the sound of your heart that hit your ears, against the serum and the bad memories, against the pain that you caused to Peter until there was no pain anymore.</p><p><b><i>\u2014\u2014\u201cAvengers: Far from home.\u201d\u2014\u2014</i></b>  </p><p>You and Peter reached the battlefield just as Tony lay on his knees on the ground after being stabbed by Thanos, while he felt the power of the gem when it landed in its place in the gauntlet.</p><p>&ldquo;There you are, my child&hellip;&rdquo; Thanos said, drawing your attention from Tony. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want to go without listen to an answer from you. You have too much power to leave you here with them, so I will give you two options: come with me and I will forgive your friends, or stay here to kill them yourself. Don&rsquo;t force me to force you. I came from far away for you.&rdquo;</p><p>You took a deep breath, but you realized that part of him also feared what you were capable of doing. Not even you knew how much power was inside you, but maybe, there was so much power to destroy an entire planet or him.</p><p>&ldquo;You already have what you needed, now go.&rdquo;</p><p>Thanos denied, but with a quick movement of his hand, he pulled the collar from your neck towards his hand. That gift that was taken from you was like the gravity that kept you close to sanity, and he knew it.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you remember that night?&rdquo; Thanos looked at the quartz crystal necklace before looking at you. &ldquo;The fair, the boy who gave it to you, the way you were kidnapped by your own uncle that same night and how you woke up in that facility when you were not supposed to see it. The first man who tried to stop you, you stopped his electric gun with one hand. Your uncle tried to shoot you, right? But he failed and you threw him into the air, he tried to shoot you again, but it hit another person&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Your body shuddered as if you had heard the sound of the bullet there in TITAN, and then the grunt of pain and the sound of a body falling to the ground.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t listen to him, (y/n)&hellip;&rdquo; Tony tried to stand up, holding the place where Thanos had stabbed him with his own weapon. &ldquo;Honey, look at me. It wasn&rsquo;t your fault that Ethan died. It was your uncle who shot him, not you.&rdquo;</p><p>Your hands began to tremble uncontrollably, but your dilated gaze didn&rsquo;t let you see past Thanos.</p><p>&ldquo;But it was because he followed me&hellip;&rdquo; Finally, and as if the pain came out of your body with that action, you cried for him, one tear after another. &ldquo;He fell, but smiled at me through the pain before dying. And my own uncle laughed, and told me I was a waste of his time, and I&hellip; that power came from me and I couldn&rsquo;t control it anymore. I destroyed the whole place and turned it into rubble.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Do you think you could do it again?&rdquo; Thanos smiled while he created another portal to leave the planet. &ldquo;What will happen when I tell you that Stark&rsquo;s company owned that facility that held you captive every night? Do it, honey, kill them all.&rdquo;</p><p>The last thing you saw before Thanos used the gauntlet to throw a haze of power that made you fall to the ground in pain, was the most perverse smile on his face while Quill suddenly appeared, launching missiles before Thanos disappeared. </p><p>\u201c(y/n)!\u201d </p><p>Peter ran to you as you rolled over your body to lean on your legs, but that power that was like an injection of pain made you raise your hand to make him fall to the ground. The fever inside you was high in the sudden madness, your cloudy eyes let you see blurry figures as you tried to stand up, with trembling legs and a pain that hammered your head.</p><p>&ldquo;Honey, listen to me&hellip;&rdquo; Tony, who had healed his wound with the help of his suit, approached you without doing it too close. &ldquo;You are strong, control the thoughts in your head, don&rsquo;t let the power consume you.&rdquo;</p><p>Was it true what Thanos said? Tony knew what they were doing to you? You took a step back, and another, watching your trembling hands and the white glow that formed around them, the same that began to form around your entire body. You clenched your jaw tightly in an attempt to control the pain and the strength that struggled to get out of you, but that power felt like the size of the world, so heavy and impossible to control.</p><p>\u201c(y/n)\u201d</p><p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; You raised a hand to Tony to stop him, but as a reflex of protection, Tony raised his hand as well, activating the weapon in his palm that he deactivated immediately.</p><p>He looked at you with surprise after his action. Was it true what Thanos said? Could you kill them all if you couldn&rsquo;t stop yourself? When the ground began to tremble under your feet and the stones began to rise, the power within you became a fire of white color, burning without hurting you. You knew you had to let it out, release it against yourself before you turned the others into ashes.</p><p>The ground trembled under the power of an earthquake.</p><p>And you looked up at him like a goodbye.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry&hellip;&rdquo; you said, watching Peter before you tried to create a force field that contained the power you were about to release.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>With you standing there, big flares of white fire spread throughout the space of the shield, so bright that it blinded everyone around, forcing them to protect themselves with their arms. It was almost a beautiful feeling when you were finally unable to feel something, physically or emotionally. For a moment, there was nothing, no pain, no fear. But when you felt again you were able to open your eyes that seemed to have become accustomed to the fire, all the power within you was abruptly extinguished.</p><p>You, who were not alone there, were protected under an even greater power.</p><p>Under the astonished glances of all who had managed to get there, including yours, Peter slightly moved the arms that he pressed against your body, and slightly afraid, he opened his eyes until his gaze fell on you.</p><p>&ldquo;How did you&hellip;?&rdquo; You both said at the same time, he trying to ask how you didn&rsquo;t hurt him, while you tried to find out how he did it without you hurting him.</p><p>Peter smiled, the tiredness in his eyes was evident, as it was the relief and happiness, but even then, he tightened his arms around you again.</p><p>&ldquo;I told you I wouldn&rsquo;t leave you alone.&rdquo;</p><p>The air wasn&rsquo;t enough to breathe, but you did it because he was still alive.</p><p>&ldquo;Something is happening.&rdquo; You heard Mantis say, what forced you two to separate.</p><p>And suddenly, she became dust under Quill&rsquo;s arm and the wind took her away. Tony, who was close to you two, looked around, panting in surprise as Drax turned to dust as well.</p><p>&ldquo;Steady, Quill&hellip;&rdquo; Tony said, trying to calm him down when he saw the fear in his eyes before disappearing.</p><p>&ldquo;Tony&hellip;&rdquo; Strange called his name, forcing him to return in fear. &ldquo;There was no other way.&rdquo;</p><p>And like the others, the sorcerer turned to dust.</p><p>&ldquo;Mr. Stark? I don&rsquo;t feel so good&hellip;&rdquo; Peter called, placing a hand over yours. Tony and you turned at the same time, watching the same terrifying scene. Peter couldn&rsquo;t stand on his feet, and suddenly, his gaze was lost on a part of the ground. He tried to look at both of you, desperately searching for help that neither of them could give him. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s happening.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony walked towards him, catching him the moment Peter fell on him.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wanna go. I don&rsquo;t wanna go, please. Please, I don&rsquo;t wanna go.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony laid him down on the floor, right under your eyes, whereas unlike the others, his body began to slowly turn to dust.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry&hellip;&rdquo; He said, looking at Tony and finally at you before leaving too.</p><p>Tony tried to hold him, but his hand sank into the dust that had once been Peter&rsquo;s body. And he left you two there, in the silent and with a blank mind as Tony sat on the rock and you knelt in front of him with your eyes on the wind while small pieces of dust still swayed in the breeze. </p><p>Your hand covered his and he took it, squeezing it with both.</p><p><i>THE END.</i></p><p><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mP3-CUYquRNuOpzTrUahJPg\">@aspiring-fangirls-world</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mvSO31rK29CWGKpXCangciw\">@caswinchester2000</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mUfy2UaWOdd0bVmmgp3hdXw\">@spider-slutt</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mLYmsUES3HXHb7hp193PoiQ\">@itsanonymouschick</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m-8zHaRIRwPPTpSJkVrz6nA\">@multifandomthemusical</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mG1ML7rjrp3XZSey7FTU-Og\">@fiftyshadesofriri</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mOPL6rNx63Ks_87bWHlgSUw\">@sparklesspidey</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mBWKqX0a6Xkb1gctJJJDd1g\">@-thatgirloverthere-</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m8pJY21jdD4AF8fPm3zM4rw\">@mrscutiefandobhaz</a> </p>",

I don\u2019t feel so good\u2026\u201d Peter called, placing a hand over yours. Tony and you turned at the same time, watching the same terrifying scene. Peter couldn\u2019t stand on his feet, and suddenly, his gaze was lost on a part of the ground. He tried to look at both of you, desperately searching for help that neither of them could give him. \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening.\u201d</p><p>Tony walked towards him, catching him the moment Peter fell on him.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t wanna go. I don\u2019t wanna go, please. Please, I don\u2019t wanna go.\u201d</p><p>Tony laid him down on the floor, right under your eyes, whereas unlike the others, his body began to slowly turn to dust.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2026\u201d He said, looking at Tony and finally at you before leaving too.</p><p>Tony tried to hold him, but his hand sank into the dust that had once been Peter\u2019s body. And he left you two there, in the silent and with a blank mind as Tony sat on the rock and you knelt in front of him with your eyes on the wind while small pieces of dust still swayed in the breeze. </p><p>Your hand covered his and he took it, squeezing it with both.</p><p><i>THE END.</i></p><p><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mP3-CUYquRNuOpzTrUahJPg\">@aspiring-fangirls-world</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mvSO31rK29CWGKpXCangciw\">@caswinchester2000</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mUfy2UaWOdd0bVmmgp3hdXw\">@spider-slutt</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mLYmsUES3HXHb7hp193PoiQ\">@itsanonymouschick</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m-8zHaRIRwPPTpSJkVrz6nA\">@multifandomthemusical</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mG1ML7rjrp3XZSey7FTU-Og\">@fiftyshadesofriri</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mOPL6rNx63Ks_87bWHlgSUw\">@sparklesspidey</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mBWKqX0a6Xkb1gctJJJDd1g\">@-thatgirloverthere-</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m8pJY21jdD4AF8fPm3zM4rw\">@mrscutiefandobhaz</a> </p></p>",

I don\u2019t know. find that yourself after reading. Love you all! Request are open :)</i></p><p>From the orange-tinged sky, Tony pushed that square piece of metal towards Thanos, crushing him under it and making tornados of dust. However, the villain\u2019s last words stole your breath while the serum in your veins froze inside you remembering the explosion you caused in that facility, burying everyone on the way: how you killed those people\u2026 And suddenly, while Quill ambushed Thanos like Drax and the others, the memory of that night fell on you like a spell, freezing you there, not able to move even when they worked together to stop Thanos with Stranger\u2019s spell, Drax\u2019s muscles, Mantis powers, Peter\u2019s web or Tony\u2019s strength. \u00a0</p><p>\u201c(y/n) don\u2019t listen to him, Darling.\u201d Tony said with a soft voice, despite his jaw clenched by the force he used trying to take the gauntlet from Thanos. \u201cWhat happened that night was not your fault, they forced you to do it. They hurt you, they pushed you to do what you did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat I did\u2026\u201d You whispered, looking up from the floor and towards him, showing the tears you couldn\u2019t hide.</p><p>Tony shook his head, in an attempt to make you see that it wasn\u2019t your fault.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Darlin\u2019, I need your help.\u201d</p><p>However, it was Quill who was able to free himself from the paralysis that caused him to hear that Gamora had died. Thanos\u2019s sadness in his semi-unconscious state unleashed the anger inside Quill, since he considered him false, selfish, and a real murderer, so he hit him with his gun, again and again, screaming with frustration the pain in his soul for the loss of his beloved, ruining the plan when they almost had the battle won. When Thanos awoke from the spell, his powers that were superior were defeating each of the superheroes, pushing them away with a punch or fainting them with the power of the gauntlet. To all but you, as if he had an interest in you and in what you did.</p><p>\u201cI know your story, dear. The pain and death you caused and your desire to remedy what you did. Why do you fight against me if you can let me do this without causing any pain? \"A few steps from you, he looked directly into your eyes, with some peace under the cold of the battle. \"You can cause a catastrophe on earth. I can see the power within you, I can see the fear in your eyes. Join me, my dear, let me do my job\u2026 I promise that your mother could have a godly death.\u201d</p><p>You gave a strong inhalation when you heard about your mom, but even on that planet, the air wasn\u2019t enough to fill the void in your lungs.</p><p>\u201cHey! Leave her alone, asshole!\u201d</p><p>Tony flew over him, hitting hard the arm that Thanos extended in your direction. But the villain was stronger than everyone and the battle between them was short-lived when he pushed Tony with a strong blow. While the avenger fell to the ground, Thanos used the power of the gauntlet to move a moon that floated in the sky, shedding meteorites of rock that he launched with an arrow speed towards the planet.</p><p>Tony, behind his Iron Man mask, and you, held the other\u2019s gaze for a few seconds before he flew over the moon to stop it, trusting that you would use that great power within you, to help him save the others.</p><p><b><i>\u2014\u2014\u201cAvengers: Far from home.\u201d\u2014\u2014</i></b>  </p><p>Protected by a big force field that shone under a white light, the world shook under that great explosion and turned everything into view in a thick sandstorm. With one knee bent against the ground to stabilize yourself, the mist had vanished just like the shield as you stood up, turning around when you felt a hand on your shoulder. Half of Peter\u2019s body fell on you, kneeling on the ground next to you, without his mask to breathe better. The only one awake among the bodies of Quill, Mantis, Drax and Nebula, to whom Thanos had fainted with the power of the gauntlet.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re okay\u2026 Yeah, you\u2019re okay.\u201d He breathed raggedly, smiling barely, as he looked up to see you better while you stared at him. It wasn\u2019t a question, but a confirmation. In that moment of complete astonishment on your part, Peter ignored Tony\u2019s words and raised a trembling hand to rest it on your cheek, gently. \u201cYou\u2019re good a person, okay? Don\u2019t forget it.\u201d</p><p>You held your breath, avoiding making any movement, because maybe in that way, your body would miss the contact with another person and how dangerous it could be. But you, in that moment, tried to quiet the voice in your head that said how dangerous you were, just to keep him close to you.</p><p>If Peter was about to make another move or not, an explosion far away from you distracted you both, but as you tried to get up, Peter couldn\u2019t, keeping you on the ground.</p><p>\u201cTony needs help\u2026\u201d You said, part of you distrusting if you could help him. \u201cStay here, Peter. You will be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019ll go too.\u201d He tried to get up, still with his hands on your arms, but it was as if the force of a magnet pushed him back to the ground with a pain inside his body.</p><p>It was then that reality hit you, and you shook your head, because you refused to believe it.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s me. I\u2019m doing this to you.\u201d</p><p>You gently pushed his arms away from you to get up and stop hurting him, because that\u2019s what you were doing; It was you who was taking away his strength. Peter looked disoriented as he stood up as well, looking at you, not understanding how you could do that.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to be bad, Peter, but I\u2019m not good either.\u201d</p><p>The sadness in your voice hit Peter\u2019s heart, because he could see through you, because he thought you were good, but it was your fear that didn\u2019t let you see your true self, your past had covered your eyes, like if your mind were another person inside you, convincing you with a lie.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go, please\u2026\u201d Peter tried to take a step towards you, forcing you to give one back. \u201cStop running away, (y/n). Let me prove you\u2019re good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026\u201d Peter denied, but there was no absolute fear on his face. On the contrary, his eyes seemed to shine with the hope of finding a solution. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if you keep pushing me away for fear of hurting me, I will stay with you until we find a solution. I promise.\u201d</p><p>Peter came up to you, while the bravery in his eyes caused something in you to break down. The infinite desire to be who you used to be made your soul go through that wall that you created around you to protect others, because only then you would protect yourself from causing another pain, but it but collapsed to your feet when his hands held your face, fighting at first against the pain that your body began to exhale as a defense mechanism. But as you tried to use your hands to push him away from you, they clung to his arms the moment he pressed his lips against yours.</p><p>Despite the fear that brought tears to your closed eyes, you stayed there, waiting. Inside, you fought against that painful power that ran through your body, against the sound of your heart that hit your ears, against the serum and the bad memories, against the pain that you caused to Peter until there was no pain anymore.</p><p><b><i>\u2014\u2014\u201cAvengers: Far from home.\u201d\u2014\u2014</i></b>  </p><p>You and Peter reached the battlefield just as Tony lay on his knees on the ground after being stabbed by Thanos, while he felt the power of the gem when it landed in its place in the gauntlet.</p><p>\u201cThere you are, my child\u2026\u201d Thanos said, drawing your attention from Tony. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to go without listen to an answer from you. You have too much power to leave you here with them, so I will give you two options: come with me and I will forgive your friends, or stay here to kill them yourself.

Tony, who was close to you two, looked around, panting in surprise as Drax turned to dust as well.</p><p>\u201cSteady, Quill\u2026\u201d Tony said, trying to calm him down when he saw the fear in his eyes before disappearing.</p><p>\u201cTony\u2026\u201d Strange called his name, forcing him to return in fear. \u201cThere was no other way.\u201d</p><p>And like the others, the sorcerer turned to dust.</p><p>\u201cMr. Stark? I don\u2019t feel so good\u2026\u201d Peter called, placing a hand over yours. Tony and you turned at the same time, watching the same terrifying scene. Peter couldn\u2019t stand on his feet, and suddenly, his gaze was lost on a part of the ground. He tried to look at both of you, desperately searching for help that neither of them could give him. \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening.\u201d</p><p>Tony walked towards him, catching him the moment Peter fell on him.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t wanna go. I don\u2019t wanna go, please. Please, I don\u2019t wanna go.\u201d</p><p>Tony laid him down on the floor, right under your eyes, whereas unlike the others, his body began to slowly turn to dust.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2026\u201d He said, looking at Tony and finally at you before leaving too.</p><p>Tony tried to hold him, but his hand sank into the dust that had once been Peter\u2019s body. And he left you two there, in the silent and with a blank mind as Tony sat on the rock and you knelt in front of him with your eyes on the wind while small pieces of dust still swayed in the breeze. </p><p>Your hand covered his and he took it, squeezing it with both.</p><p><i>THE END.</i></p><p><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mP3-CUYquRNuOpzTrUahJPg\">@aspiring-fangirls-world</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mvSO31rK29CWGKpXCangciw\">@caswinchester2000</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mUfy2UaWOdd0bVmmgp3hdXw\">@spider-slutt</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mLYmsUES3HXHb7hp193PoiQ\">@itsanonymouschick</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m-8zHaRIRwPPTpSJkVrz6nA\">@multifandomthemusical</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mG1ML7rjrp3XZSey7FTU-Og\">@fiftyshadesofriri</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mOPL6rNx63Ks_87bWHlgSUw\">@sparklesspidey</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mBWKqX0a6Xkb1gctJJJDd1g\">@-thatgirloverthere-</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m8pJY21jdD4AF8fPm3zM4rw\">@mrscutiefandobhaz</a> </p></p>",
                "content": "<p><h1>&ldquo;Avengers: Far from home.&rdquo; Chapter 4 - The end.</h1><p><i>Soooo&hellip; this is the final chapter (I suppose) Because after this ending I&rsquo;m not sure if I could write more. Everyone has seen the movie so I hope you don&rsquo;t hate me for what you are about to read. I&rsquo;m not the best writer but I hope you like it, or something like that. I don&rsquo;t know. find that yourself after reading. Love you all! Request are open :)</i></p><p>From the orange-tinged sky, Tony pushed that square piece of metal towards Thanos, crushing him under it and making tornados of dust. However, the villain&rsquo;s last words stole your breath while the serum in your veins froze inside you remembering the explosion you caused in that facility, burying everyone on the way: how you killed those people&hellip; And suddenly, while Quill ambushed Thanos like Drax and the others, the memory of that night fell on you like a spell, freezing you there, not able to move even when they worked together to stop Thanos with Stranger&rsquo;s spell, Drax&rsquo;s muscles, Mantis powers, Peter&rsquo;s web or Tony&rsquo;s strength. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;(y/n) don&rsquo;t listen to him, Darling.&rdquo; Tony said with a soft voice, despite his jaw clenched by the force he used trying to take the gauntlet from Thanos. &ldquo;What happened that night was not your fault, they forced you to do it. They hurt you, they pushed you to do what you did.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What I did&hellip;&rdquo; You whispered, looking up from the floor and towards him, showing the tears you couldn&rsquo;t hide.</p><p>Tony shook his head, in an attempt to make you see that it wasn&rsquo;t your fault.</p><p>&ldquo;Come on, Darlin&rsquo;, I need your help.&rdquo;</p><p>However, it was Quill who was able to free himself from the paralysis that caused him to hear that Gamora had died. Thanos&rsquo;s sadness in his semi-unconscious state unleashed the anger inside Quill, since he considered him false, selfish, and a real murderer, so he hit him with his gun, again and again, screaming with frustration the pain in his soul for the loss of his beloved, ruining the plan when they almost had the battle won. When Thanos awoke from the spell, his powers that were superior were defeating each of the superheroes, pushing them away with a punch or fainting them with the power of the gauntlet. To all but you, as if he had an interest in you and in what you did.</p><p>&ldquo;I know your story, dear. The pain and death you caused and your desire to remedy what you did. Why do you fight against me if you can let me do this without causing any pain? \"A few steps from you, he looked directly into your eyes, with some peace under the cold of the battle. \"You can cause a catastrophe on earth. I can see the power within you, I can see the fear in your eyes. Join me, my dear, let me do my job&hellip; I promise that your mother could have a godly death.&rdquo;</p><p>You gave a strong inhalation when you heard about your mom, but even on that planet, the air wasn&rsquo;t enough to fill the void in your lungs.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey! Leave her alone, asshole!&rdquo;</p><p>Tony flew over him, hitting hard the arm that Thanos extended in your direction. But the villain was stronger than everyone and the battle between them was short-lived when he pushed Tony with a strong blow. While the avenger fell to the ground, Thanos used the power of the gauntlet to move a moon that floated in the sky, shedding meteorites of rock that he launched with an arrow speed towards the planet.</p><p>Tony, behind his Iron Man mask, and you, held the other&rsquo;s gaze for a few seconds before he flew over the moon to stop it, trusting that you would use that great power within you, to help him save the others.</p><p><b><i>&mdash;&mdash;&ldquo;Avengers: Far from home.&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</i></b>  </p><p>Protected by a big force field that shone under a white light, the world shook under that great explosion and turned everything into view in a thick sandstorm. With one knee bent against the ground to stabilize yourself, the mist had vanished just like the shield as you stood up, turning around when you felt a hand on your shoulder. Half of Peter&rsquo;s body fell on you, kneeling on the ground next to you, without his mask to breathe better. The only one awake among the bodies of Quill, Mantis, Drax and Nebula, to whom Thanos had fainted with the power of the gauntlet.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re okay&hellip; Yeah, you&rsquo;re okay.&rdquo; He breathed raggedly, smiling barely, as he looked up to see you better while you stared at him. It wasn&rsquo;t a question, but a confirmation. In that moment of complete astonishment on your part, Peter ignored Tony&rsquo;s words and raised a trembling hand to rest it on your cheek, gently. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re good a person, okay? Don&rsquo;t forget it.&rdquo;</p><p>You held your breath, avoiding making any movement, because maybe in that way, your body would miss the contact with another person and how dangerous it could be. But you, in that moment, tried to quiet the voice in your head that said how dangerous you were, just to keep him close to you.</p><p>If Peter was about to make another move or not, an explosion far away from you distracted you both, but as you tried to get up, Peter couldn&rsquo;t, keeping you on the ground.</p><p>&ldquo;Tony needs help&hellip;&rdquo; You said, part of you distrusting if you could help him. &ldquo;Stay here, Peter. You will be fine.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;ll go too.&rdquo; He tried to get up, still with his hands on your arms, but it was as if the force of a magnet pushed him back to the ground with a pain inside his body.</p><p>It was then that reality hit you, and you shook your head, because you refused to believe it.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s me. I&rsquo;m doing this to you.&rdquo;</p><p>You gently pushed his arms away from you to get up and stop hurting him, because that&rsquo;s what you were doing; It was you who was taking away his strength. Peter looked disoriented as he stood up as well, looking at you, not understanding how you could do that.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to be bad, Peter, but I&rsquo;m not good either.&rdquo;</p><p>The sadness in your voice hit Peter&rsquo;s heart, because he could see through you, because he thought you were good, but it was your fear that didn&rsquo;t let you see your true self, your past had covered your eyes, like if your mind were another person inside you, convincing you with a lie.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go, please&hellip;&rdquo; Peter tried to take a step towards you, forcing you to give one back. &ldquo;Stop running away, (y/n). Let me prove you&rsquo;re good.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&hellip;&rdquo; Peter denied, but there was no absolute fear on his face. On the contrary, his eyes seemed to shine with the hope of finding a solution. &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter if you keep pushing me away for fear of hurting me, I will stay with you until we find a solution. I promise.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter came up to you, while the bravery in his eyes caused something in you to break down. The infinite desire to be who you used to be made your soul go through that wall that you created around you to protect others, because only then you would protect yourself from causing another pain, but it but collapsed to your feet when his hands held your face, fighting at first against the pain that your body began to exhale as a defense mechanism. But as you tried to use your hands to push him away from you, they clung to his arms the moment he pressed his lips against yours.</p><p>Despite the fear that brought tears to your closed eyes, you stayed there, waiting. Inside, you fought against that painful power that ran through your body, against the sound of your heart that hit your ears, against the serum and the bad memories, against the pain that you caused to Peter until there was no pain anymore.</p><p><b><i>&mdash;&mdash;&ldquo;Avengers: Far from home.&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</i></b>  </p><p>You and Peter reached the battlefield just as Tony lay on his knees on the ground after being stabbed by Thanos, while he felt the power of the gem when it landed in its place in the gauntlet.</p><p>&ldquo;There you are, my child&hellip;&rdquo; Thanos said, drawing your attention from Tony. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want to go without listen to an answer from you. You have too much power to leave you here with them, so I will give you two options: come with me and I will forgive your friends, or stay here to kill them yourself. Don&rsquo;t force me to force you. I came from far away for you.&rdquo;</p><p>You took a deep breath, but you realized that part of him also feared what you were capable of doing. Not even you knew how much power was inside you, but maybe, there was so much power to destroy an entire planet or him.</p><p>&ldquo;You already have what you needed, now go.&rdquo;</p><p>Thanos denied, but with a quick movement of his hand, he pulled the collar from your neck towards his hand. That gift that was taken from you was like the gravity that kept you close to sanity, and he knew it.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you remember that night?&rdquo; Thanos looked at the quartz crystal necklace before looking at you. &ldquo;The fair, the boy who gave it to you, the way you were kidnapped by your own uncle that same night and how you woke up in that facility when you were not supposed to see it. The first man who tried to stop you, you stopped his electric gun with one hand. Your uncle tried to shoot you, right? But he failed and you threw him into the air, he tried to shoot you again, but it hit another person&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Your body shuddered as if you had heard the sound of the bullet there in TITAN, and then the grunt of pain and the sound of a body falling to the ground.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t listen to him, (y/n)&hellip;&rdquo; Tony tried to stand up, holding the place where Thanos had stabbed him with his own weapon. &ldquo;Honey, look at me. It wasn&rsquo;t your fault that Ethan died. It was your uncle who shot him, not you.&rdquo;</p><p>Your hands began to tremble uncontrollably, but your dilated gaze didn&rsquo;t let you see past Thanos.</p><p>&ldquo;But it was because he followed me&hellip;&rdquo; Finally, and as if the pain came out of your body with that action, you cried for him, one tear after another. &ldquo;He fell, but smiled at me through the pain before dying. And my own uncle laughed, and told me I was a waste of his time, and I&hellip; that power came from me and I couldn&rsquo;t control it anymore. I destroyed the whole place and turned it into rubble.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Do you think you could do it again?&rdquo; Thanos smiled while he created another portal to leave the planet. &ldquo;What will happen when I tell you that Stark&rsquo;s company owned that facility that held you captive every night? Do it, honey, kill them all.&rdquo;</p><p>The last thing you saw before Thanos used the gauntlet to throw a haze of power that made you fall to the ground in pain, was the most perverse smile on his face while Quill suddenly appeared, launching missiles before Thanos disappeared. </p><p>&ldquo;(y/n)!&rdquo; </p><p>Peter ran to you as you rolled over your body to lean on your legs, but that power that was like an injection of pain made you raise your hand to make him fall to the ground. The fever inside you was high in the sudden madness, your cloudy eyes let you see blurry figures as you tried to stand up, with trembling legs and a pain that hammered your head.</p><p>&ldquo;Honey, listen to me&hellip;&rdquo; Tony, who had healed his wound with the help of his suit, approached you without doing it too close. &ldquo;You are strong, control the thoughts in your head, don&rsquo;t let the power consume you.&rdquo;</p><p>Was it true what Thanos said? Tony knew what they were doing to you? You took a step back, and another, watching your trembling hands and the white glow that formed around them, the same that began to form around your entire body. You clenched your jaw tightly in an attempt to control the pain and the strength that struggled to get out of you, but that power felt like the size of the world, so heavy and impossible to control.</p><p>&ldquo;(y/n)&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; You raised a hand to Tony to stop him, but as a reflex of protection, Tony raised his hand as well, activating the weapon in his palm that he deactivated immediately.</p><p>He looked at you with surprise after his action. Was it true what Thanos said? Could you kill them all if you couldn&rsquo;t stop yourself? When the ground began to tremble under your feet and the stones began to rise, the power within you became a fire of white color, burning without hurting you. You knew you had to let it out, release it against yourself before you turned the others into ashes.</p><p>The ground trembled under the power of an earthquake.</p><p>And you looked up at him like a goodbye.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry&hellip;&rdquo; you said, watching Peter before you tried to create a force field that contained the power you were about to release.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>With you standing there, big flares of white fire spread throughout the space of the shield, so bright that it blinded everyone around, forcing them to protect themselves with their arms. It was almost a beautiful feeling when you were finally unable to feel something, physically or emotionally. For a moment, there was nothing, no pain, no fear.

In fact, not only was this not his room, he knows this room even though he hasn\u2019t stepped foot in it for years now.</p><p>Of course, of all the windows I could open by mistake, the one that I had to choose belongs to someone that actually knows me! </p><p>Sitting at the desk across the room was his neighbor. Not just a neighbor, but Emmeline, the daughter of May\u2019s coworker. And not just Emmeline, the daughter of May\u2019s coworker, but, Emmy, someone he used to play with when he was younger and still sees around regularly. My freaking luck! \u00a0</p><p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t have my glasses on, but I\u2019m pretty sure you\u2019re wearing a red-and-blue unitard&hellip;\u201d She was looking at him through squinted, and slightly unfocused eyes, while reaching around for something under her desk. Peter could see that her face was marked with indentations from the spirals of her notebook in front of her. Okay, she seems pretty out of it, maybe I can just hop ba\u2014 </p><p>Peter startled at the sight in front of him, because Emmy was now holding the handle of an instrument case and positioned ready to swing at him. \u201cSo either you\u2019re Spider-Man, and you\u2019re going to tell me why the hell you\u2019re in my room,\u201d she started, as she was approaching him with a glare \u201cor you\u2019re a creep and I\u2019m going to throw this, \u00a0and you, out the window and cal\u2014\u201c \u00a0</p><p>He caught her arm mid-swing, and would have been looking at her with wide-eyes if he didn\u2019t have the mask on. How can she even reach this far over the bed? She\u2019s barely over five feet tall! Despite happening to have superpowers, even Peter didn\u2019t feel like falling from a building at 2 in the morning. Karen was saying something to him, but he wasn\u2019t processing it. All he could hear was the blood rushing through his body, his heart pumping faster and faster. \u00a0</p><p><b>Peter you don\u2019t </b>\u2014\u201cI\u2019m Spider-Man!\u201d He squeaked out. <b>\u2014have the voice modifier on </b>. </p><p>Shit! Why why why why?! This is not happening. </p><p>Emmy was squinting at him even harder now. She moved to kneel on the bed completely and grabbed his jaw, using her hand that was still holding her instrument, with a force that probably would have had anyone else falling into the room.</p><p>\u201cThat voice. You sound really familiar\u2026\u201d Emmy shoved her face closer to him, looking at him so intently that he wouldn\u2019t be surprised if she could will his mask away with her stare. He\u2019d forgotten over time how scary she could be. \u00a0<b> I\u2019ll go ahead and switch the modifier on for you, it doesn\u2019t look like you\u2019re getting out of this easily.</b></p><p>\u201cOh really?\u201d Peter said, relaxing slightly as he heard his now modified voice come out. \u201cProbably just a coincidence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d Emmy was still looking at him like she was looking through him, but she dropped her hand off his face and shifted backwards. \u201cWhatever, I guess. You still haven\u2019t explained why you\u2019re here in my room though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou see\u2014 well, I was\u2026 I was\u2026 investigating!! I\u2019m looking for\u2026 something. Yes, I\u2019m just looking for something and um. Well, it\u2019s a classified\u2026 operation?\u201d Emmy did not look impressed at all. \u201cAnd I just, I got your room\u2014 I ended up in your room on accident! Did you know they don\u2019t put numbers on the outside of apartment buildings?\u201d Great going Peter, if your voice didn\u2019t give you away, then your rambling freaking did!!!! </p><p>Emmy didn\u2019t respond. She was just staring at him again, the squinted glare making its way back onto her face.</p><p>God, this isn\u2019t going to get any better. I just need to get out of here. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for waking you up and scaring you, I\u2019ll get out of your hair now and find, uhh, the thing I\u2019m supposed to investigate!\u201d</p><p>Peter gave her a small wave and quickly made his way out of the room. He decided against going straight to his room after looking back mid-swing and seeing Emmy peeking out her window. He ended up going around the neighborhood for another half-hour before making it back to his building (this time, making sure he was entering the right room first).</p><hr><p>After taking a quick shower, he threw himself face-first onto his bed to recharge for a bit before tackling his homework. Feeling his phone vibrate somewhere on his bed, he reached around lazily, trying to find the phone without opening his eyes or moving more than his arm. It\u2019s probably just Ned talking about whatever show he\u2019s bingeing on Netflix anyway. </p><p>Finally finding his phone, he rolled onto his back and pulled it up to his face, blearily looking at the preview of the message on his lock screen, before dropping it immediately onto his face. I\u2019m just really tired. I\u2019m sure that\u2019s not what I saw. </p><p>Peter sat up and rubbed at his eyes before picking his phone back up and opening the full message before really looking at it.</p><p>\u201cFuck. My. Life.\u201d<br/></p><hr><p><b>Emmy Cruz (2:54AM): </b>Good night Peter!

The quiet in the city wasn&rsquo;t equating to any calm in his life though. School was ramping up, May was getting more paranoid (and stricter), and it was becoming more difficult to maintain all the relationships in his life. On top of that, he&rsquo;d had the great idea that he should do some actual work at his &ldquo;Stark Internship.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>It wasn&rsquo;t going to bring him down, because even if life was trying its best to hand his ass to him, he was still putting up a pretty damn good fight. His situation at the moment, however, was that of a teenage boy running off of four hours of sleep, a full day at school, an evening at his internship, and four hours of patrolling.</p>\n<p>Thus, the current exhaustion. And the relief that swept through his body when he realized he&rsquo;d actually managed to get himself to his apartment without passing out mid-swing.</p>\n</p>",

Oh, I didn&rsquo;t mean that!&rdquo; He exclaimed as we were climbing the stairs to reach the chemistry class, grabbing our books from our lockers midway.</p><p>&ldquo;I thought you were <i>flirting</i> with me when you said that 'chemistry&rsquo; thing!&rdquo; I confessed laughing.</p><p>&ldquo;No no, I didn&rsquo;t&hellip; I can&rsquo;t flirt&hellip; I mean I can&hellip; but, I didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo; He spoke up, trying not to embarrass himself, making me laugh even more.</p><p>&ldquo;Of course, I know now!&rdquo; I said, taking a deep breath to make myself stop laughing as we entered the chemistry lab.</p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know you were so <i>interesting</i> and <i>funny</i>! &rdquo; Peter suddenly said to me in the middle of the chemistry class.</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Seriously</i>, are you now really flirting with me?&rdquo; I tried to mess with him a little, just for fun. </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an honest opinion, Y/n!&rdquo; He said, concentrating on the teacher&rsquo;s lecture again and so did I.</p><p>Finally, it was lunch period. I am so happy, that I don&rsquo;t have to sit with Liz and her group of teenage grandmoms again!</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad to know that you love Star Wars,&rdquo; he said as we were munching our food. His best friend Ned was out of town, to meet some relatives for a week, so Peter &amp; I were sitting together all day. </p><p>&ldquo;Of course I love it, I watched the Solo Star Wars movie just yesterday!!!&rdquo;</p><p>I said, <i>fangirling</i>.</p><p>&ldquo;I have a bunch of Lego Star Wars sets at home, maybe we could play with them after school?&rdquo; He said. I&rsquo;m really happy he isn&rsquo;t stuttering and getting nervous with me. </p><p>&ldquo;I never actually got an invitation from a guy to visit his place,&rdquo; I said, feeling a little shy.</p><p>&ldquo;And I haven&rsquo;t ever invited a girl to my place&rdquo;, he said in a soft tone, making me look from my food up to him.</p><p><i>As I looked at him our eyes met,</i></p><p><i>for like two seconds and then he instantly looked down.</i></p><p>&ldquo;So,&hellip; you are coming?&rdquo; He said looking down, smiling.</p><p>&ldquo;Only if you tell me your address&rdquo;, I replied, making him look at me chuckling.</p><p>&ldquo;Give me your phone number, I&rsquo;ll send it to you.&rdquo; And so I handed him my phone.</p><p><b>Ding, Ding, Ding</b>.</p><p>And there is the lunch bell.</p><p>We continued travelling from one class to another as periods went by and after what felt like a decade, the final bell rang and&hellip; I was happy to go home?! No&hellip; not my home, but Peter&rsquo;s home!</p><p>I rushed to my hellish home, washed the dishes, cleaned the house, ate lunch sitting with my cruel fosters and then my phone went off&hellip;</p><p>&mdash;</p><p><b>[ A message from an unknown number.
