From a cluttered office on Madison Avenue in Midtown Manhattan in the 1960s, he helped dream up a lineup of pulp-fiction heroes that has come to define much of popular culture in the early 21st century.</p><p>Mr. Lee was a central player in the creation of those characters and more, all properties of <a href=\"http://marvel.com/\" title=\"Website\">Marvel Comics</a>. Indeed, he was for many the embodiment of Marvel, if not comic books in general, overseeing the company\u2019s emergence as an international media behemoth. A writer, editor, publisher, Hollywood executive and tireless promoter (of Marvel and of himself), he played a critical role in what comics fans call the medium\u2019s silver age.</p><p>Many believe that Marvel, under his leadership and infused with his colorful voice, crystallized that era, one of exploding sales, increasingly complex characters and stories, and growing cultural legitimacy for the medium. (Marvel\u2019s chief competitor at the time, National Periodical Publications, now known as DC \u2014 the home of Superman and Batman, among countless other characters \u2014 augured this period but did not define it, with its 1956 update of its superhero the Flash.)</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"716\" data-orig-width=\"1271\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b06e5c1653f10b95de66eb7f2df8c26f/tumblr_inline_pi3tj49kgJ1ra1kx0_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"716\" data-orig-width=\"1271\"/></figure><p>Under Mr. Lee, Marvel transformed the comic book world by imbuing its characters with the self-doubts and neuroses of average people, as well an awareness of trends and social causes and, often, a sense of humor.</p><p>In humanizing his heroes, giving them character flaws and insecurities that belied their supernatural strengths, Mr. Lee tried \u201cto make them real flesh-and-blood characters with personality,\u201d he told The Washington Post in 1992.</p><p>\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what any story should have, but comics didn\u2019t have until that point,\u201d he said. \u201cThey were all cardboard figures.\u201d\n\n<br/></p><p>\n\nEnergetic, gregarious, optimistic and alternately grandiose and self-effacing, Mr. Lee was an effective salesman, employing a Barnumesque syntax in print (\u201cFace front, true believer!\u201d \u201cMake mine Marvel!\u201d) to market Marvel\u2019s products to a rabid following.\n\n<br/></p><p>He charmed readers with jokey, conspiratorial comments and asterisked asides in narrative panels, often referring them to previous issues. In 2003 he told The Los Angeles Times, \u201cI wanted the reader to feel we were all friends, that we were sharing some private fun that the outside world wasn\u2019t aware of.\u201d</p><p>Though Mr. Lee was often criticized for his role in denying rights and royalties to his artistic collaborators , his involvement in the conception of many of Marvel\u2019s best-known characters is indisputable.</p><h2>Reading Shakespeare at 10</h2><p>He was born Stanley Martin Lieber on Dec. 28, 1922, in Manhattan, the older of two sons born to Jack Lieber, an occasionally employed dress cutter, and Celia (Solomon) Lieber, both immigrants from Romania. The family moved to the Bronx.</p><p>Stanley began reading Shakespeare at 10 while also devouring pulp magazines, the novels of Arthur Conan Doyle, Edgar Rice Burroughs and Mark Twain, and the swashbuckler movies of Errol Flynn.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"661\" data-orig-width=\"634\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d0fb9368e9f4ad70df7ba8988014f427/tumblr_inline_pi3tm4d8P41ra1kx0_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"661\" data-orig-width=\"634\"/></figure><p>He graduated at 17 from DeWitt Clinton High School in the Bronx and aspired to be a writer of serious literature. He was set on the path to becoming a different kind of writer when, after a few false starts at other jobs, he was hired at Timely Publications, a company owned by <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1992/06/11/obituaries/martin-goodman-84-began-marvel-comics.html?module=inline\" title=\"Times obituary\">Martin Goodman</a>, a relative who had made his name in pulp magazines and was entering the comics field.</p><p>Mr. Lee was initially paid $8 a week as an office gofer. Eventually he was writing and editing stories, many in the superhero genre.</p><p>At Timely he worked with the artist <a href=\"http://kirbymuseum.org/\" title=\"Mr. Kirby's museum\">Jack Kirby</a> (1917-94), who, with a writing partner, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/16/books/joe-simon-a-creator-of-captain-america-is-dead-at-98.html?module=inline\" title=\"Mr. Simon's obituary\">Joe Simon</a>, had created the hit character Captain America, and who would eventually play a vital role in Mr. Lee\u2019s career. When Mr. Simon and Mr. Kirby, Timely\u2019s hottest stars, were lured away by a rival company, Mr. Lee was appointed chief editor.</p><p>As a writer, Mr. Lee could be startlingly prolific. \u201cAlmost everything I\u2019ve ever written I could finish at one sitting,\u201d he once said. \u201cI\u2019m a fast writer. Maybe not the best, but the fastest.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Lee used several pseudonyms to give the impression that Marvel had a large stable of writers; the name that stuck was simply his first name split in two. (In the 1970s, he legally changed Lieber to Lee.)</p><p>During World War II, Mr. Lee wrote training manuals stateside in the Army Signal Corps while moonlighting as a comics writer. In 1947, he married Joan Boocock, a former model who had moved to New York from her native England.</p><p>His daughter Joan Celia Lee, who is known as J. C., was born in 1950; another daughter, Jan, died three days after birth in 1953. Mr. Lee\u2019s wife died in 2017.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1364\" data-orig-width=\"2048\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/56bbdccf38cfc7f3fd886c7f7ee344b4/tumblr_inline_pi3t99hb0h1ra1kx0_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"1364\" data-orig-width=\"2048\"/></figure><p><b>\n\nMr. Lee at his office in Manhattan in 1980.

Sauro/The New York Times\n\n</b><br/></p><p>A lawyer for Ms. Lee, Kirk Schenck, confirmed Mr. Lee\u2019s death, at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles.</p><p>In addition to his daughter, he is survived by Ms. Lee and his younger brother, Larry Lieber, who drew the \u201cAmazing Spider-Man\u201d syndicated newspaper strip for years.</p><p>In the mid-1940s, the peak of the golden age of comic books, sales boomed. But later, as plots and characters turned increasingly lurid (especially at EC, a Marvel competitor that published titles like Tales From the Crypt and The Vault of Horror), many adults clamored for censorship. In 1954, a Senate subcommittee led by the Tennessee Democrat Estes Kefauver held hearings investigating allegations that comics promoted immorality and juvenile delinquency.</p><p>Feeding the senator\u2019s crusade was the psychiatrist <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1981/12/01/obituaries/fredric-wertham-86-dies-foe-of-violent-tv-and-comics.html?module=inline\" title=\"Times obituary\">Fredric Wertham</a>\u2019s 1954 anti-comics jeremiad, \u201cSeduction of the Innocent.\u201d Among other claims, the book contended that DC\u2019s \u201cBatman stories\u201d \u2014 featuring the team of Batman and Robin \u2014 were \u201cpsychologically homosexual.\u201d</p><p>Opting to police itself rather than accept legislation, the comics industry established the Comics Code Authority to ensure wholesome content. Graphic gore and moral ambiguity were out, but so largely were wit, literary influences and attention to social issues. Innocuous cookie-cutter exercises in genre were in.</p><p>Many found the sanitized comics boring, and \u2014 with the new medium of television providing competition \u2014 readership, which at one point had reached 600 million sales annually, declined by almost three-quarters within a few years.</p><p>With the dimming of superhero comics\u2019 golden age, Mr. Lee grew tired of grinding out generic humor, romance, western and monster stories for what had by then become Atlas Comics. Reaching a career impasse in his 30s, he was encouraged by his wife to write the comics he wanted to, not merely what was considered marketable. And Mr. Goodman, his boss, spurred by the popularity of a rebooted Flash (and later Green Lantern) at DC, wanted him to revisit superheroes.</p><p>Mr. Lee took Mr. Goodman up on his suggestion, but he carried its implications much further.</p><h2>Enter the Fantastic Four</h2><p>In 1961, Mr. Lee and Mr. Kirby \u2014 whom he had brought back years before to the company, now known as Marvel \u2014 produced the first issue of The Fantastic Four, about a superpowered team with humanizing dimensions: nonsecret identities, internal squabbles and, in the orange-rock-skinned Thing, self-torment. It was a hit.</p><p>Other Marvel titles \u2014 like the Lee-Kirby creation The Incredible Hulk, a modern Jekyll-and-Hyde story about a decent man transformed by radiation into a monster \u2014 offered a similar template. The quintessential Lee hero, introduced in 1962 and created with the artist Steve Ditko (1927-2018), was Spider-Man.</p><p>A timid high school intellectual who gained his powers when bitten by a radioactive spider, Spider-Man was prone to soul-searching, leavened with wisecracks \u2014 a key to the character\u2019s lasting popularity across multiple entertainment platforms, including movies and a Broadway musical.</p><p>In 1961, Mr. Lee and Mr. Kirby \u2014 whom he had brought back years before to the company, now known as Marvel \u2014 produced the first issue of The Fantastic Four, about a superpowered team with humanizing dimensions: nonsecret identities, internal squabbles and, in the orange-rock-skinned Thing, self-torment.

The quintessential Lee hero, introduced in 1962 and created with the artist Steve Ditko (1927-2018), was Spider-Man.</p><p>A timid high school intellectual who gained his powers when bitten by a radioactive spider, Spider-Man was prone to soul-searching, leavened with wisecracks \u2014 a key to the character\u2019s lasting popularity across multiple entertainment platforms, including movies and a Broadway musical.</p><p>Mr. Lee\u2019s dialogue encompassed Catskills shtick, like Spider-Man\u2019s patter in battle; Elizabethan idioms, like Thor\u2019s; and working-class Lower East Side swagger, like the Thing\u2019s. It could also include dime-store poetry, as in this eco-oratory about humans, uttered by the Silver Surfer, a space alien:</p><p>\u201cAnd yet \u2014 in their uncontrollable insanity \u2014 in their unforgivable blindness \u2014 they seek to destroy this shining jewel \u2014 this softly spinning gem \u2014 this tiny blessed sphere \u2014 which men call Earth!\u201d</p><p>Mr. Lee practiced what he called the Marvel method: Instead of handing artists scripts to illustrate, he summarized stories and let the artists draw them and fill in plot details as they chose. He then added sound effects and dialogue. Sometimes he would discover on penciled pages that new characters had been added to the narrative. Such surprises (like the Silver Surfer, a Kirby creation and a Lee favorite) would lead to questions of character ownership.</p><p>Mr. Lee was often faulted for not adequately acknowledging the contributions of his illustrators, especially Mr. Kirby. Spider-Man became Marvel\u2019s best-known property, but Mr. Ditko, its co-creator, quit Marvel in bitterness in 1966. Mr. Kirby, who visually designed countless characters, left in 1969. Though he reunited with Mr. Lee for a Silver Surfer graphic novel in 1978, their heyday had ended.</p><p>Many comic fans believe that Mr. Kirby was wrongly deprived of royalties and original artwork in his lifetime, and for years the Kirby estate sought to acquire rights to characters that Mr. Kirby and Mr. Lee had created together. Mr. Kirby\u2019s heirs were long rebuffed in court on the grounds that he had done \u201cwork for hire\u201d \u2014 in other words, that he had essentially sold his art without expecting royalties.</p><p>In September 2014, Marvel and the Kirby estate reached a settlement. Mr. Lee and Mr. Kirby now both receive credit on numerous screen productions based on their work.</p><h2>Turning to Live Action</h2><p>Mr. Lee moved to Los Angeles in 1980 to develop Marvel properties, but most of his attempts at live-action television and movies were disappointing. (The series \u201cThe Incredible Hulk,\u201d seen on CBS from 1978 to 1982, was an exception.)</p><p>Avi Arad, an executive at Toy Biz, a company in which Marvel had bought a controlling interest, began to revive the company\u2019s Hollywood fortunes, particularly with an animated \u201cX-Men\u201d series on Fox, which ran from 1992 to 1997. (Its success helped pave the way for the live-action big-screen \u201cX-Men\u201d franchise, which has flourished since its first installment, in 2000.)</p><p>In the late 1990s, Mr. Lee was named chairman emeritus at Marvel and began to explore outside projects. While his personal appearances (including charging fans $120 for an autograph) were one source of income, later attempts to create wholly owned superhero properties foundered. Stan Lee Media, a digital content start-up, crashed in 2000 and landed his business partner, Peter F. Paul, in prison for securities fraud. (Mr. Lee was never charged.)</p><p>In 2001, Mr. Lee started POW! Entertainment (the initials stand for \u201cpurveyors of wonder\u201d), but he received almost no income from Marvel movies and TV series until he won a court fight with Marvel Enterprises in 2005, leading to an undisclosed settlement costing Marvel $10 million. In 2009, the Walt Disney Company, which had agreed to pay $4 billion to acquire Marvel, announced that it had paid $2.5 million to increase its stake in POW!</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1365\" data-orig-width=\"2048\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/c7c1119bbbda90e427dd385379464e84/tumblr_inline_pi3tckW0lV1ra1kx0_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"1365\" data-orig-width=\"2048\"/></figure><p><b>\n\nChadwick Boseman, left, as T\u2019Challa/Black Panther and Michael B.

In 2018, Mr. Lee was embroiled in disputes with POW!, and The Daily Beast and The Hollywood Reporter ran accounts of fierce infighting among Mr. Lee\u2019s daughter, household staff and business advisers. The Hollywood Reporter claimed \u201celder abuse.\u201d</p><p>In February 2018, Mr. Lee signed a notarized document declaring that three men \u2014 a lawyer, a caretaker of Mr. Lee\u2019s and a dealer in memorabilia \u2014 had \u201cinsinuated themselves into relationships with J. C. for an ulterior motive and purpose,\u201d to \u201cgain control over my assets, property and money.\u201d He later withdrew his claim, but longtime aides of his \u2014 an assistant, an accountant and a housekeeper \u2014 were either dismissed or greatly limited in their contact with him.</p><p>In a profile in The New York Times in April, a cheerful Mr. Lee said, \u201cI\u2019m the luckiest guy in the world,\u201d adding that \u201cmy daughter has been a great help to me\u201d and that \u201clife is pretty good\u201d \u2014 although he admitted in that same interview, \u201cI\u2019ve been very careless with money.\u201d</p><p>Marvel movies, however, have proved a cash cow for major studios, if not so much for Mr. Lee. With the blockbuster \u201cSpider-Man\u201d in 2002, Marvel superhero films hit their stride. Such movies (including franchises starring Iron Man, Thor and the superhero team the Avengers, to name but three) together had grossed more than $24 billion worldwide as of April.</p><p>\u201cBlack Panther,\u201d the first Marvel movie directed by an African-American (Ryan Coogler) and starring an almost all-black cast, took in about $201.8 million domestically when it opened over the four-day Presidents\u2019 Day weekend this year, the fifth-biggest opening of all time.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"366\" data-orig-width=\"650\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/dc2df611a7493cc1a6b07fa8957c544b/tumblr_inline_pi3tuoZYXV1ra1kx0_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"366\" data-orig-width=\"650\"/></figure><p><b>\n\nJoan Lee, wife of Marvel Comics legend Stan Lee, dies at age 93\n\n</b><br/></p><p>Many other film properties are in development, in addition to sequels in established franchises. Characters Mr. Lee had a hand in creating now enjoy a degree of cultural penetration they have never had before.</p><p>Mr. Lee wrote a slim memoir, \u201cExcelsior! The Amazing Life of Stan Lee,\u201d with George Mair, published in 2002. His 2015 book, \u201cAmazing Fantastic Incredible: A Marvelous Memoir\u201d (written with Peter David and illustrated in comic-book form by Colleen Doran), pays abundant credit to the artists many fans believed he had shortchanged years before.</p><p>Mr. Lee continued writing to the end. His first novel, \u201cA Trick of Light,\u201d written with Kat Rosenfield, is scheduled to be published by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt next year.</p><p>Recent Marvel films and TV shows have also often credited Mr. Lee\u2019s former collaborators; Mr. Lee himself has almost always received an executive producer credit. His <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aXfFjvUgzM\" title=\"A compilation of Stan Lee's movie and TV cameos.\">cameo appearances</a> in them became something of a tradition. (Even \u201cTeen Titans Go! to the Movies,\u201d an animated feature in 2018 about a DC superteam, had more than one Lee cameo.) TV shows bearing his name or presence have included the reality series \u201cStan Lee\u2019s Superhumans\u201d and the competition show \u201cWho Wants to Be a Superhero?\u201d</p><p>Mr. Lee\u2019s unwavering energy suggested that he possessed superpowers himself. (In his 90s he had a Twitter account, @TheRealStanlee.) And the National Endowment for the Arts acknowledged as much when it awarded him a National Medal of Arts in 2008. But he was frustrated, like all humans, by mortality.</p><p>\u201cI want to do more movies, I want to do more television, more DVDs, more multi-sodes, I want to do more lecturing, I want to do more of everything I\u2019m doing,\u201d he said in \u201c<a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1091863/\" title=\"About the documentary\">With Great Power \u2026: The Stan Lee Story</a>,\u201d a 2010 television documentary. \u201cThe only problem is time.

He was set on the path to becoming a different kind of writer when, after a few false starts at other jobs, he was hired at Timely Publications, a company owned by <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1992/06/11/obituaries/martin-goodman-84-began-marvel-comics.html?module=inline\" title=\"Times obituary\">Martin Goodman</a>, a relative who had made his name in pulp magazines and was entering the comics field.</p><p>Mr. Lee was initially paid $8 a week as an office gofer.

Maybe not the best, but the fastest.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Lee used several pseudonyms to give the impression that Marvel had a large stable of writers; the name that stuck was simply his first name split in two. (In the 1970s, he legally changed Lieber to Lee.)</p><p>During World War II, Mr. Lee wrote training manuals stateside in the Army Signal Corps while moonlighting as a comics writer. In 1947, he married Joan Boocock, a former model who had moved to New York from her native England.</p><p>His daughter Joan Celia Lee, who is known as J. C., was born in 1950; another daughter, Jan, died three days after birth in 1953.

But later, as plots and characters turned increasingly lurid (especially at EC, a Marvel competitor that published titles like Tales From the Crypt and The Vault of Horror), many adults clamored for censorship. In 1954, a Senate subcommittee led by the Tennessee Democrat Estes Kefauver held hearings investigating allegations that comics promoted immorality and juvenile delinquency.</p><p>Feeding the senator\u2019s crusade was the psychiatrist <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1981/12/01/obituaries/fredric-wertham-86-dies-foe-of-violent-tv-and-comics.html?module=inline\" title=\"Times obituary\">Fredric Wertham</a>\u2019s 1954 anti-comics jeremiad, \u201cSeduction of the Innocent.\u201d Among other claims, the book contended that DC\u2019s \u201cBatman stories\u201d \u2014 featuring the team of Batman and Robin \u2014 were \u201cpsychologically homosexual.\u201d</p><p>Opting to police itself rather than accept legislation, the comics industry established the Comics Code Authority to ensure wholesome content. Graphic gore and moral ambiguity were out, but so largely were wit, literary influences and attention to social issues. Innocuous cookie-cutter exercises in genre were in.</p><p>Many found the sanitized comics boring, and \u2014 with the new medium of television providing competition \u2014 readership, which at one point had reached 600 million sales annually, declined by almost three-quarters within a few years.</p><p>With the dimming of superhero comics\u2019 golden age, Mr. Lee grew tired of grinding out generic humor, romance, western and monster stories for what had by then become Atlas Comics. Reaching a career impasse in his 30s, he was encouraged by his wife to write the comics he wanted to, not merely what was considered marketable. And Mr. Goodman, his boss, spurred by the popularity of a rebooted Flash (and later Green Lantern) at DC, wanted him to revisit superheroes.</p><p>Mr. Lee took Mr. Goodman up on his suggestion, but he carried its implications much further.</p><h2>Enter the Fantastic Four</h2><p>In 1961, Mr. Lee and Mr. Kirby \u2014 whom he had brought back years before to the company, now known as Marvel \u2014 produced the first issue of The Fantastic Four, about a superpowered team with humanizing dimensions: nonsecret identities, internal squabbles and, in the orange-rock-skinned Thing, self-torment.

It could also include dime-store poetry, as in this eco-oratory about humans, uttered by the Silver Surfer, a space alien:</p><p>\u201cAnd yet \u2014 in their uncontrollable insanity \u2014 in their unforgivable blindness \u2014 they seek to destroy this shining jewel \u2014 this softly spinning gem \u2014 this tiny blessed sphere \u2014 which men call Earth!\u201d</p><p>Mr. Lee practiced what he called the Marvel method: Instead of handing artists scripts to illustrate, he summarized stories and let the artists draw them and fill in plot details as they chose. He then added sound effects and dialogue. Sometimes he would discover on penciled pages that new characters had been added to the narrative. Such surprises (like the Silver Surfer, a Kirby creation and a Lee favorite) would lead to questions of character ownership.</p><p>Mr. Lee was often faulted for not adequately acknowledging the contributions of his illustrators, especially Mr. Kirby. Spider-Man became Marvel\u2019s best-known property, but Mr. Ditko, its co-creator, quit Marvel in bitterness in 1966. Mr. Kirby, who visually designed countless characters, left in 1969. Though he reunited with Mr. Lee for a Silver Surfer graphic novel in 1978, their heyday had ended.</p><p>Many comic fans believe that Mr. Kirby was wrongly deprived of royalties and original artwork in his lifetime, and for years the Kirby estate sought to acquire rights to characters that Mr. Kirby and Mr. Lee had created together. Mr. Kirby\u2019s heirs were long rebuffed in court on the grounds that he had done \u201cwork for hire\u201d \u2014 in other words, that he had essentially sold his art without expecting royalties.</p><p>In September 2014, Marvel and the Kirby estate reached a settlement. Mr. Lee and Mr. Kirby now both receive credit on numerous screen productions based on their work.</p><h2>Turning to Live Action</h2><p>Mr. Lee moved to Los Angeles in 1980 to develop Marvel properties, but most of his attempts at live-action television and movies were disappointing. (The series \u201cThe Incredible Hulk,\u201d seen on CBS from 1978 to 1982, was an exception.)</p><p>Avi Arad, an executive at Toy Biz, a company in which Marvel had bought a controlling interest, began to revive the company\u2019s Hollywood fortunes, particularly with an animated \u201cX-Men\u201d series on Fox, which ran from 1992 to 1997. (Its success helped pave the way for the live-action big-screen \u201cX-Men\u201d franchise, which has flourished since its first installment, in 2000.)</p><p>In the late 1990s, Mr. Lee was named chairman emeritus at Marvel and began to explore outside projects. While his personal appearances (including charging fans $120 for an autograph) were one source of income, later attempts to create wholly owned superhero properties foundered. Stan Lee Media, a digital content start-up, crashed in 2000 and landed his business partner, Peter F. Paul, in prison for securities fraud. (Mr. Lee was never charged.)</p><p>In 2001, Mr. Lee started POW! Entertainment (the initials stand for \u201cpurveyors of wonder\u201d), but he received almost no income from Marvel movies and TV series until he won a court fight with Marvel Enterprises in 2005, leading to an undisclosed settlement costing Marvel $10 million. In 2009, the Walt Disney Company, which had agreed to pay $4 billion to acquire Marvel, announced that it had paid $2.5 million to increase its stake in POW!</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1365\" data-orig-width=\"2048\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/c7c1119bbbda90e427dd385379464e84/tumblr_inline_pi3tckW0lV1ra1kx0_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"1365\" data-orig-width=\"2048\"></figure><p><b>\n\nChadwick Boseman, left, as T\u2019Challa/Black Panther and Michael B.

In 2018, Mr. Lee was embroiled in disputes with POW!, and The Daily Beast and The Hollywood Reporter ran accounts of fierce infighting among Mr. Lee\u2019s daughter, household staff and business advisers. The Hollywood Reporter claimed \u201celder abuse.\u201d</p><p>In February 2018, Mr. Lee signed a notarized document declaring that three men \u2014 a lawyer, a caretaker of Mr. Lee\u2019s and a dealer in memorabilia \u2014 had \u201cinsinuated themselves into relationships with J. C. for an ulterior motive and purpose,\u201d to \u201cgain control over my assets, property and money.\u201d He later withdrew his claim, but longtime aides of his \u2014 an assistant, an accountant and a housekeeper \u2014 were either dismissed or greatly limited in their contact with him.</p><p>In a profile in The New York Times in April, a cheerful Mr. Lee said, \u201cI\u2019m the luckiest guy in the world,\u201d adding that \u201cmy daughter has been a great help to me\u201d and that \u201clife is pretty good\u201d \u2014 although he admitted in that same interview, \u201cI\u2019ve been very careless with money.\u201d</p><p>Marvel movies, however, have proved a cash cow for major studios, if not so much for Mr. Lee. With the blockbuster \u201cSpider-Man\u201d in 2002, Marvel superhero films hit their stride. Such movies (including franchises starring Iron Man, Thor and the superhero team the Avengers, to name but three) together had grossed more than $24 billion worldwide as of April.</p><p>\u201cBlack Panther,\u201d the first Marvel movie directed by an African-American (Ryan Coogler) and starring an almost all-black cast, took in about $201.8 million domestically when it opened over the four-day Presidents\u2019 Day weekend this year, the fifth-biggest opening of all time.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"366\" data-orig-width=\"650\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/dc2df611a7493cc1a6b07fa8957c544b/tumblr_inline_pi3tuoZYXV1ra1kx0_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"366\" data-orig-width=\"650\"></figure><p><b>\n\nJoan Lee, wife of Marvel Comics legend Stan Lee, dies at age 93\n\n</b><br></p><p>Many other film properties are in development, in addition to sequels in established franchises. Characters Mr. Lee had a hand in creating now enjoy a degree of cultural penetration they have never had before.</p><p>Mr. Lee wrote a slim memoir, \u201cExcelsior! The Amazing Life of Stan Lee,\u201d with George Mair, published in 2002. His 2015 book, \u201cAmazing Fantastic Incredible: A Marvelous Memoir\u201d (written with Peter David and illustrated in comic-book form by Colleen Doran), pays abundant credit to the artists many fans believed he had shortchanged years before.</p><p>Mr. Lee continued writing to the end. His first novel, \u201cA Trick of Light,\u201d written with Kat Rosenfield, is scheduled to be published by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt next year.</p><p>Recent Marvel films and TV shows have also often credited Mr. Lee\u2019s former collaborators; Mr. Lee himself has almost always received an executive producer credit. His <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aXfFjvUgzM\" title=\"A compilation of Stan Lee's movie and TV cameos.\">cameo appearances</a> in them became something of a tradition. (Even \u201cTeen Titans Go! to the Movies,\u201d an animated feature in 2018 about a DC superteam, had more than one Lee cameo.) TV shows bearing his name or presence have included the reality series \u201cStan Lee\u2019s Superhumans\u201d and the competition show \u201cWho Wants to Be a Superhero?\u201d</p><p>Mr. Lee\u2019s unwavering energy suggested that he possessed superpowers himself. (In his 90s he had a Twitter account, @TheRealStanlee.) And the National Endowment for the Arts acknowledged as much when it awarded him a National Medal of Arts in 2008. But he was frustrated, like all humans, by mortality.</p><p>\u201cI want to do more movies, I want to do more television, more DVDs, more multi-sodes, I want to do more lecturing, I want to do more of everything I\u2019m doing,\u201d he said in \u201c<a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1091863/\" title=\"About the documentary\">With Great Power \u2026: The Stan Lee Story</a>,\u201d a 2010 television documentary. \u201cThe only problem is time.

It could also include dime-store poetry, as in this eco-oratory about humans, uttered by the Silver Surfer, a space alien:</p><p>\u201cAnd yet \u2014 in their uncontrollable insanity \u2014 in their unforgivable blindness \u2014 they seek to destroy this shining jewel \u2014 this softly spinning gem \u2014 this tiny blessed sphere \u2014 which men call Earth!\u201d</p><p>Mr. Lee practiced what he called the Marvel method: Instead of handing artists scripts to illustrate, he summarized stories and let the artists draw them and fill in plot details as they chose. He then added sound effects and dialogue. Sometimes he would discover on penciled pages that new characters had been added to the narrative. Such surprises (like the Silver Surfer, a Kirby creation and a Lee favorite) would lead to questions of character ownership.</p><p>Mr. Lee was often faulted for not adequately acknowledging the contributions of his illustrators, especially Mr. Kirby. Spider-Man became Marvel\u2019s best-known property, but Mr. Ditko, its co-creator, quit Marvel in bitterness in 1966. Mr. Kirby, who visually designed countless characters, left in 1969. Though he reunited with Mr. Lee for a Silver Surfer graphic novel in 1978, their heyday had ended.</p><p>Many comic fans believe that Mr. Kirby was wrongly deprived of royalties and original artwork in his lifetime, and for years the Kirby estate sought to acquire rights to characters that Mr. Kirby and Mr. Lee had created together. Mr. Kirby\u2019s heirs were long rebuffed in court on the grounds that he had done \u201cwork for hire\u201d \u2014 in other words, that he had essentially sold his art without expecting royalties.</p><p>In September 2014, Marvel and the Kirby estate reached a settlement. Mr. Lee and Mr. Kirby now both receive credit on numerous screen productions based on their work.</p><h2>Turning to Live Action</h2><p>Mr. Lee moved to Los Angeles in 1980 to develop Marvel properties, but most of his attempts at live-action television and movies were disappointing. (The series \u201cThe Incredible Hulk,\u201d seen on CBS from 1978 to 1982, was an exception.)</p><p>Avi Arad, an executive at Toy Biz, a company in which Marvel had bought a controlling interest, began to revive the company\u2019s Hollywood fortunes, particularly with an animated \u201cX-Men\u201d series on Fox, which ran from 1992 to 1997. (Its success helped pave the way for the live-action big-screen \u201cX-Men\u201d franchise, which has flourished since its first installment, in 2000.)</p><p>In the late 1990s, Mr. Lee was named chairman emeritus at Marvel and began to explore outside projects. While his personal appearances (including charging fans $120 for an autograph) were one source of income, later attempts to create wholly owned superhero properties foundered. Stan Lee Media, a digital content start-up, crashed in 2000 and landed his business partner, Peter F. Paul, in prison for securities fraud. (Mr. Lee was never charged.)</p><p>In 2001, Mr. Lee started POW! Entertainment (the initials stand for \u201cpurveyors of wonder\u201d), but he received almost no income from Marvel movies and TV series until he won a court fight with Marvel Enterprises in 2005, leading to an undisclosed settlement costing Marvel $10 million. In 2009, the Walt Disney Company, which had agreed to pay $4 billion to acquire Marvel, announced that it had paid $2.5 million to increase its stake in POW!</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1365\" data-orig-width=\"2048\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/c7c1119bbbda90e427dd385379464e84/tumblr_inline_pi3tckW0lV1ra1kx0_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"1365\" data-orig-width=\"2048\"></figure><p><b>\n\nChadwick Boseman, left, as T\u2019Challa/Black Panther and Michael B.

In 2018, Mr. Lee was embroiled in disputes with POW!, and The Daily Beast and The Hollywood Reporter ran accounts of fierce infighting among Mr. Lee\u2019s daughter, household staff and business advisers. The Hollywood Reporter claimed \u201celder abuse.\u201d</p><p>In February 2018, Mr. Lee signed a notarized document declaring that three men \u2014 a lawyer, a caretaker of Mr. Lee\u2019s and a dealer in memorabilia \u2014 had \u201cinsinuated themselves into relationships with J. C. for an ulterior motive and purpose,\u201d to \u201cgain control over my assets, property and money.\u201d He later withdrew his claim, but longtime aides of his \u2014 an assistant, an accountant and a housekeeper \u2014 were either dismissed or greatly limited in their contact with him.</p><p>In a profile in The New York Times in April, a cheerful Mr. Lee said, \u201cI\u2019m the luckiest guy in the world,\u201d adding that \u201cmy daughter has been a great help to me\u201d and that \u201clife is pretty good\u201d \u2014 although he admitted in that same interview, \u201cI\u2019ve been very careless with money.\u201d</p><p>Marvel movies, however, have proved a cash cow for major studios, if not so much for Mr. Lee. With the blockbuster \u201cSpider-Man\u201d in 2002, Marvel superhero films hit their stride. Such movies (including franchises starring Iron Man, Thor and the superhero team the Avengers, to name but three) together had grossed more than $24 billion worldwide as of April.</p><p>\u201cBlack Panther,\u201d the first Marvel movie directed by an African-American (Ryan Coogler) and starring an almost all-black cast, took in about $201.8 million domestically when it opened over the four-day Presidents\u2019 Day weekend this year, the fifth-biggest opening of all time.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"366\" data-orig-width=\"650\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/dc2df611a7493cc1a6b07fa8957c544b/tumblr_inline_pi3tuoZYXV1ra1kx0_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"366\" data-orig-width=\"650\"></figure><p><b>\n\nJoan Lee, wife of Marvel Comics legend Stan Lee, dies at age 93\n\n</b><br></p><p>Many other film properties are in development, in addition to sequels in established franchises.

The Amazing Life of Stan Lee,\u201d with George Mair, published in 2002. His 2015 book, \u201cAmazing Fantastic Incredible: A Marvelous Memoir\u201d (written with Peter David and illustrated in comic-book form by Colleen Doran), pays abundant credit to the artists many fans believed he had shortchanged years before.</p><p>Mr. Lee continued writing to the end. His first novel, \u201cA Trick of Light,\u201d written with Kat Rosenfield, is scheduled to be published by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt next year.</p><p>Recent Marvel films and TV shows have also often credited Mr. Lee\u2019s former collaborators; Mr. Lee himself has almost always received an executive producer credit. His <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aXfFjvUgzM\" title=\"A compilation of Stan Lee's movie and TV cameos.\">cameo appearances</a> in them became something of a tradition. (Even \u201cTeen Titans Go! to the Movies,\u201d an animated feature in 2018 about a DC superteam, had more than one Lee cameo.) TV shows bearing his name or presence have included the reality series \u201cStan Lee\u2019s Superhumans\u201d and the competition show \u201cWho Wants to Be a Superhero?\u201d</p><p>Mr. Lee\u2019s unwavering energy suggested that he possessed superpowers himself. (In his 90s he had a Twitter account, @TheRealStanlee.) And the National Endowment for the Arts acknowledged as much when it awarded him a National Medal of Arts in 2008. But he was frustrated, like all humans, by mortality.</p><p>\u201cI want to do more movies, I want to do more television, more DVDs, more multi-sodes, I want to do more lecturing, I want to do more of everything I\u2019m doing,\u201d he said in \u201c<a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1091863/\" title=\"About the documentary\">With Great Power \u2026: The Stan Lee Story</a>,\u201d a 2010 television documentary. \u201cThe only problem is time.

And Mr. Goodman, his boss, spurred by the popularity of a rebooted Flash (and later Green Lantern) at DC, wanted him to revisit superheroes.</p><p>Mr. Lee took Mr. Goodman up on his suggestion, but he carried its implications much further.</p><h2>Enter the Fantastic Four</h2><p>In 1961, Mr. Lee and Mr. Kirby &mdash; whom he had brought back years before to the company, now known as Marvel &mdash; produced the first issue of The Fantastic Four, about a superpowered team with humanizing dimensions: nonsecret identities, internal squabbles and, in the orange-rock-skinned Thing, self-torment.

The quintessential Lee hero, introduced in 1962 and created with the artist Steve Ditko (1927-2018), was Spider-Man.</p><p>A timid high school intellectual who gained his powers when bitten by a radioactive spider, Spider-Man was prone to soul-searching, leavened with wisecracks &mdash; a key to the character&rsquo;s lasting popularity across multiple entertainment platforms, including movies and a Broadway musical.</p><p>Mr. Lee&rsquo;s dialogue encompassed Catskills shtick, like Spider-Man&rsquo;s patter in battle; Elizabethan idioms, like Thor&rsquo;s; and working-class Lower East Side swagger, like the Thing&rsquo;s. It could also include dime-store poetry, as in this eco-oratory about humans, uttered by the Silver Surfer, a space alien:</p><p>&ldquo;And yet &mdash; in their uncontrollable insanity &mdash; in their unforgivable blindness &mdash; they seek to destroy this shining jewel &mdash; this softly spinning gem &mdash; this tiny blessed sphere &mdash; which men call Earth!&rdquo;</p><p>Mr. Lee practiced what he called the Marvel method: Instead of handing artists scripts to illustrate, he summarized stories and let the artists draw them and fill in plot details as they chose. He then added sound effects and dialogue. Sometimes he would discover on penciled pages that new characters had been added to the narrative. Such surprises (like the Silver Surfer, a Kirby creation and a Lee favorite) would lead to questions of character ownership.</p><p>Mr. Lee was often faulted for not adequately acknowledging the contributions of his illustrators, especially Mr. Kirby. Spider-Man became Marvel&rsquo;s best-known property, but Mr. Ditko, its co-creator, quit Marvel in bitterness in 1966. Mr. Kirby, who visually designed countless characters, left in 1969. Though he reunited with Mr. Lee for a Silver Surfer graphic novel in 1978, their heyday had ended.</p><p>Many comic fans believe that Mr. Kirby was wrongly deprived of royalties and original artwork in his lifetime, and for years the Kirby estate sought to acquire rights to characters that Mr. Kirby and Mr. Lee had created together. Mr. Kirby&rsquo;s heirs were long rebuffed in court on the grounds that he had done &ldquo;work for hire&rdquo; &mdash; in other words, that he had essentially sold his art without expecting royalties.</p><p>In September 2014, Marvel and the Kirby estate reached a settlement. Mr. Lee and Mr. Kirby now both receive credit on numerous screen productions based on their work.</p><h2>Turning to Live Action</h2><p>Mr. Lee moved to Los Angeles in 1980 to develop Marvel properties, but most of his attempts at live-action television and movies were disappointing. (The series &ldquo;The Incredible Hulk,&rdquo; seen on CBS from 1978 to 1982, was an exception.)</p><p>Avi Arad, an executive at Toy Biz, a company in which Marvel had bought a controlling interest, began to revive the company&rsquo;s Hollywood fortunes, particularly with an animated &ldquo;X-Men&rdquo; series on Fox, which ran from 1992 to 1997. (Its success helped pave the way for the live-action big-screen &ldquo;X-Men&rdquo; franchise, which has flourished since its first installment, in 2000.)</p><p>In the late 1990s, Mr. Lee was named chairman emeritus at Marvel and began to explore outside projects. While his personal appearances (including charging fans $120 for an autograph) were one source of income, later attempts to create wholly owned superhero properties foundered. Stan Lee Media, a digital content start-up, crashed in 2000 and landed his business partner, Peter F. Paul, in prison for securities fraud. (Mr. Lee was never charged.)</p><p>In 2001, Mr. Lee started POW! Entertainment (the initials stand for &ldquo;purveyors of wonder&rdquo;), but he received almost no income from Marvel movies and TV series until he won a court fight with Marvel Enterprises in 2005, leading to an undisclosed settlement costing Marvel $10 million. In 2009, the Walt Disney Company, which had agreed to pay $4 billion to acquire Marvel, announced that it had paid $2.5 million to increase its stake in POW!</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/c7c1119bbbda90e427dd385379464e84/tumblr_inline_pi3tckW0lV1ra1kx0_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p><b>\n\nChadwick Boseman, left, as T&rsquo;Challa/Black Panther and Michael B.

In 2018, Mr. Lee was embroiled in disputes with POW!, and The Daily Beast and The Hollywood Reporter ran accounts of fierce infighting among Mr. Lee&rsquo;s daughter, household staff and business advisers. The Hollywood Reporter claimed &ldquo;elder abuse.&rdquo;</p><p>In February 2018, Mr. Lee signed a notarized document declaring that three men &mdash; a lawyer, a caretaker of Mr. Lee&rsquo;s and a dealer in memorabilia &mdash; had &ldquo;insinuated themselves into relationships with J. C. for an ulterior motive and purpose,&rdquo; to &ldquo;gain control over my assets, property and money.&rdquo; He later withdrew his claim, but longtime aides of his &mdash; an assistant, an accountant and a housekeeper &mdash; were either dismissed or greatly limited in their contact with him.</p><p>In a profile in The New York Times in April, a cheerful Mr. Lee said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m the luckiest guy in the world,&rdquo; adding that &ldquo;my daughter has been a great help to me&rdquo; and that &ldquo;life is pretty good&rdquo; &mdash; although he admitted in that same interview, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been very careless with money.&rdquo;</p><p>Marvel movies, however, have proved a cash cow for major studios, if not so much for Mr. Lee. With the blockbuster &ldquo;Spider-Man&rdquo; in 2002, Marvel superhero films hit their stride. Such movies (including franchises starring Iron Man, Thor and the superhero team the Avengers, to name but three) together had grossed more than $24 billion worldwide as of April.</p><p>&ldquo;Black Panther,&rdquo; the first Marvel movie directed by an African-American (Ryan Coogler) and starring an almost all-black cast, took in about $201.8 million domestically when it opened over the four-day Presidents&rsquo; Day weekend this year, the fifth-biggest opening of all time.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/dc2df611a7493cc1a6b07fa8957c544b/tumblr_inline_pi3tuoZYXV1ra1kx0_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p><b>\n\nJoan Lee, wife of Marvel Comics legend Stan Lee, dies at age 93\n\n</b><br /></p><p>Many other film properties are in development, in addition to sequels in established franchises. Characters Mr. Lee had a hand in creating now enjoy a degree of cultural penetration they have never had before.</p><p>Mr. Lee wrote a slim memoir, &ldquo;Excelsior! The Amazing Life of Stan Lee,&rdquo; with George Mair, published in 2002. His 2015 book, &ldquo;Amazing Fantastic Incredible: A Marvelous Memoir&rdquo; (written with Peter David and illustrated in comic-book form by Colleen Doran), pays abundant credit to the artists many fans believed he had shortchanged years before.</p><p>Mr. Lee continued writing to the end. His first novel, &ldquo;A Trick of Light,&rdquo; written with Kat Rosenfield, is scheduled to be published by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt next year.</p><p>Recent Marvel films and TV shows have also often credited Mr. Lee&rsquo;s former collaborators; Mr. Lee himself has almost always received an executive producer credit. His <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aXfFjvUgzM\" title=\"A compilation of Stan Lee's movie and TV cameos.\">cameo appearances</a> in them became something of a tradition. (Even &ldquo;Teen Titans Go! to the Movies,&rdquo; an animated feature in 2018 about a DC superteam, had more than one Lee cameo.) TV shows bearing his name or presence have included the reality series &ldquo;Stan Lee&rsquo;s Superhumans&rdquo; and the competition show &ldquo;Who Wants to Be a Superhero?&rdquo;</p><p>Mr. Lee&rsquo;s unwavering energy suggested that he possessed superpowers himself. (In his 90s he had a Twitter account, @TheRealStanlee.) And the National Endowment for the Arts acknowledged as much when it awarded him a National Medal of Arts in 2008. But he was frustrated, like all humans, by mortality.</p><p>&ldquo;I want to do more movies, I want to do more television, more DVDs, more multi-sodes, I want to do more lecturing, I want to do more of everything I&rsquo;m doing,&rdquo; he said in &ldquo;<a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1091863/\" title=\"About the documentary\">With Great Power &hellip;: The Stan Lee Story</a>,&rdquo; a 2010 television documentary. &ldquo;The only problem is time. I just wish there were more time.&rdquo;</p>",
