When something is good, is the best, and when something bad happens, a tragedy. </p><p>She has to admit she is feeling a little bit like that, lately. She blames her out-of-control hormones due to pregnancy. </p><p>A growing noise on the street distracts her from her thinking. Andi told her that Cyrus is coming too, so when she hears the roar of a motorcycle in her driveway she steps to the window to see if it&rsquo;s him. </p><p>Cyrus steps off the motorcycle, holding to TJ and legs a little shaky, and Bex can&rsquo;t help a chuckle when Cyrus removes the helmet and his hair is a complete mess. TJ thinks the same, apparently, because even if Bex can barely see his face under his helmet, he ruffles Cyrus hair even more, eyes crinkling. </p><p>TJ, that&rsquo;s another thing. From mortal enemy, to Cyrus&rsquo; boyfriend. Bex shakes her head, remembering Buffy complaining about the basketball team captain. And then Cyrus, not even a year later, practically waxing poetic about him. </p><p>Bex can see Cyrus&rsquo; smile from there, talking excitedly to TJ, who is still on the motorcycle. It doesn&rsquo;t look like TJ is coming in   &ndash;Cyrus is going to tell her why and how when he comes in, for sure&ndash;, but it&rsquo;s a shame, because she actually likes the kid. He makes Cyrus happy.</p><p>She is lost in thought when she realizes that TJ is taking off his helmet and bringing Cyrus close to him. And, oh, they are kissing. Bex chuckles. Ah, to be young and in love.</p><p>She looks away when she realizes they are not going to stop kissing anytime soon. She should have realized sooner, of course they are not. They are sixteen and in love.</p><p>And they shouldn&rsquo;t stop kissing, because that&rsquo;s what they are supposed to do. Break curfew because they are so engrossed talking that they don&rsquo;t realize how late it is, be late to everything because they can&rsquo;t stop kissing while saying goodbye, arrive with ruffled hair and a swelled heart after spending time with each other. </p><p>She busies herself on the kitchen, waiting for the doorbell to ring. A few minutes later, she opens the door to a grinning, hair-ruffled Cyrus that greets her enthusiastically.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, what&rsquo;s up, Cyrus?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not much, I was with TJ&rdquo; he says, his grin growing impossibly wider &ldquo;But he has to go to work now&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a shame&rdquo; Bex says, stepping aside to let him in. Her ever growing belly making it a little difficult. &ldquo;The girls are in Andi&rsquo;s room, come on, I&rsquo;m going to ask them if they want something to eat&rdquo;</p><p>On Andi&rsquo;s room, Buffy is laying on the bed and Andi is on her desk making what seems to be a bracelet, talking over the music. They both look up and greet Cyrus with matching grins.</p><p>Bex sees them start talking excitedly &ndash;she doesn&rsquo;t even know what they are talking about. A show? A singer? God, she is getting old&ndash;.</p><p>She stays there, leaning on the doorframe.
