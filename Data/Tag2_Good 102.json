Alone, he was in his element. He was cool, he was suave, he was always on top of everything. With Aziraphale, he was thrown off guard every other minute, he was tumbling through the strange feeling of perhaps, just maybe, not being the smartest person in the room, nor the most loved.

He loved humanity, loved the world, but always Aziraphale had brought it to light, in evenings spent in London bars getting drunk with Shakespeare, days in medieval Constantinople eating fruit on plush divans, sunrises in Ur where Aziraphale pointed out the shape of the ziggurats, said he&rsquo;d been very proud of those, and Crowley remembered the commendation for future archeological bafflement he&rsquo;d gotten. He would die for his angel, and now, he thought, he was living for his angel. </p><p>Always it had been this way, and always it would remain this way, and now the thought struck Crowley that, this way that he&rsquo;d loved Aziraphale, had always been returned to him. That the warmth of Aziraphale&rsquo;s smiles and the gentleness of his touch and the lilt of his laugh had led him along the same path at whose end, at the edge of the yellow wood of loving and living and knowing, Crowley now found himself. And Crowley allowed himself to sink into the comfortable warmth of the angel beneath him, and pressed a kiss into his curls, and was content to find that the kiss was returned into the crook of his neck as he saw the water shimmer beyond them, the last light of the sun disappearing to let the stars take its place, and the breeze being ever so slightly too cool for anyone not wrapped in the arms of another</p>",
