Even when fighting sleep, the boy still looked like an angel. </p><p>\u201cTruthfully? No. There has to be life beyond earth.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYes, but what kind of life?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Dinosaur people, maybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d </p><p>\u201cCyrus?\u201d </p><p>TJ glanced over again, and saw the steady rise and fall of Cyrus\u2019s chest. He had fallen asleep. Of course.</p><p>TJ rolled over and tried to keep his mind occupied. Things had gone well. Very well, even. He had never felt closer to Cyrus. Everything they did felt so natural, like a worn in basketball shoe. Maybe that wasn\u2019t the best metaphor, TJ conceded, but still. </p><p>Yet, there was no way Cyrus would choose TJ over him. He felt a pang in his heart as he thought of the two on a date, holding hands, being together. TJ squeezed his eyes shut and tried to drown out truth. No matter what he did, he could never be good enough for Cyrus Goodman. </p><p>.~.</p><p>TJ woke up the next morning feeling more relaxed than he thought he would after a restless night of sleep. He yawned, and stretched out his arms. </p><p>It took him a moment, but TJ realized that something was&hellip;different. And that something was&hellip;a still sleeping Cyrus curled up against his side. Their sleeping bags were touching, and Cyrus\u2019s head was close to his side. </p><p>Slowly, TJ laid back down, and stared at Cyrus\u2019s face. If he moved a few inches closer, he could press his lips to the other boy\u2019s forehead. TJ felt lightheaded. The more he looked at Cyrus, the more he noticed about him. Little details he had somehow missed before. The curve of his mouth, the slope of his nose, the shape of his ears. Every part of him was endearing, and it made it even harder for him to stop liking the boy. </p><p>Before he could think about his actions, TJ  moved his head forward and gently pressed his lips to Cyrus\u2019s forehead. He pulled away, scanning the other boy\u2019s face for a reaction. But there was none.</p><p>Until Cyrus shifted, and TJ rolled his sleeping bag across the floor and against the couch. </p><p>He squeezed his eyes shut as he heard the other boy stir. TJ tried to calm his breathing. Technically he hadn\u2019t done anything wrong. Friends could kiss their friends on the forehead, right? At least, that\u2019s what he\u2019d tell Cyrus if confronted. </p><p>TJ nearly jumped out of his skin at a light tap on his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cTJ? You awake?\u201d </p><p>TJ rolled over and faked a yawn.</p><p>\u201cI am now,\u201d he fake pouted. </p><p>Cyrus\u2019s face dropped. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry! I didn\u2019t mean to wake you.\u201d </p><p>\u201cHey, you\u2019re good.\u201d </p><p>TJ could feel Cyrus\u2019s eyes on him, so he pretended to examine the living room. </p><p>\u201cWe could make some chocolate chip pancakes for breakfast, if you want.\u201d</p><p>This seemed to perk Cyrus up.</p><p>\u201cYes please!\u201d </p><p>They made their way to the kitchen, their footsteps soft and calculated. TJ\u2019s moms usually slept in late, and he didn\u2019t want to wake them. </p><p>TJ pulled out a bowl and a box of pancake mix, then turned to Cyrus, who was still lingering in the door way.</p><p>\u201cYou ok?\u201d He asked, wondering if he had done something wrong. </p><p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s just- I\u2019ve never been a very good cook,\u201d Cyrus admitted, staring at the floor.</p><p>A flood of affection for him washed over TJ, and he came over and grabbed Cyrus by the hand.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll walk you through it.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus looked up at him, and TJ\u2019s breath caught in his throat. His eyes were so big and brown, a person could drown in them.</p><p>TJ cleared his throat.</p><p>\u201cEr, first we measure the amount of mix we need.\u201d </p><p>\u201cA lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still not stuffed after last night?\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhat can I say, a Cyrus marches on his stomach.\u201d</p><p>TJ snorted. </p><p>\u201cAlso, can we have chocolate chips in these pancakes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid I not make that clear that we would?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus\u2019s face split into a grin, and TJ felt as gooey as the pancake better they were mixing. </p><p>.~.</p><p>Cyrus hadn\u2019t been lying; when it came to cooking, he had a burnt thumb. The first several pancakes came out seriously deformed. Thanks to TJ, the next batch was more edible. And at the end, the kitchen looked like a warzone. </p><p>\u201cHere, let me try,\u201d Cyrus said. </p><p>He proceeded to throw chocolate chips at TJ\u2019s mouth with varying levels of success. TJ almost choked from laughing (and from chocolate chips). They were having so much fun that they had lost track of time.</p><p>\u201cCyrus? Your mom called, she says you have your doctor\u2019s appointment soon,\u201d Kit said as she padded into the kitchen. </p><p>TJ scrupulously avoided his mother\u2019s gaze as she examined the disheveled state of the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cI forgot about that.\u201d </p><p>TJ saw Cyrus deflate, and in truth he felt something similar happen inside. They had been having so much fun that TJ had forgotten that Jonah existed at all.</p><p>\u201cYou should get going. We\u2019ll hang out later,\u201d TJ said.</p><p>\u201cBut what about the kitchen? I can\u2019t leave without helping you clean up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine, don\u2019t worry about it. You go. I can clean it up.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus hesitated, then nodded. He exited the kitchen, and TJ watched him go.</p><p>He turned with a sigh and glared at Kit. </p><p>\u201cGo on, let me have it. I know you just cleaned the kitchen yesterday and now it\u2019s a mess. I\u2019m-\u201c</p><p>\u201cHow long have you liked Cyrus?\u201d </p><p>TJ blinked.</p><p>\u201cHow long have I-? What are you talking about?\u201d He blustered.</p><p>\u201cYou think I can\u2019t tell when my son has a crush? You put up a good front, TJ, but you can\u2019t fool me.\u201d</p><p>TJ felt himself slump. Kit placed a hand on his shoulders. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s ok, TJ. Having feelings is a part of growing up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but I never expected to like another guy like this.\u201d</p><p>Kit laughed.</p><p>\u201cI was the same when I was your age. I was so convinced that some Prince Charming was going to waltz in and change my life. And then I met Sherry and she certainly changed my life, though not in the way I planned.\u201d </p><p>Kit moved towards the door, then turned to look back at TJ. </p><p>\u201cIf you like this boy that much, you should tell him. Life is too short to live with regrets.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI- thanks, mom.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAnytime. Oh, and TJ?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t clean up this kitchen today, you\u2019re grounded.\u201d</p>",

Even when fighting sleep, the boy still looked like an angel. </p><p>\u201cTruthfully? No. There has to be life beyond earth.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYes, but what kind of life?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Dinosaur people, maybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d </p><p>\u201cCyrus?\u201d </p><p>TJ glanced over again, and saw the steady rise and fall of Cyrus\u2019s chest. He had fallen asleep. Of course.</p><p>TJ rolled over and tried to keep his mind occupied. Things had gone well. Very well, even. He had never felt closer to Cyrus. Everything they did felt so natural, like a worn in basketball shoe. Maybe that wasn\u2019t the best metaphor, TJ conceded, but still. </p><p>Yet, there was no way Cyrus would choose TJ over him. He felt a pang in his heart as he thought of the two on a date, holding hands, being together. TJ squeezed his eyes shut and tried to drown out truth. No matter what he did, he could never be good enough for Cyrus Goodman. </p><p>.~.</p><p>TJ woke up the next morning feeling more relaxed than he thought he would after a restless night of sleep. He yawned, and stretched out his arms. </p><p>It took him a moment, but TJ realized that something was\u2026different. And that something was\u2026a still sleeping Cyrus curled up against his side. Their sleeping bags were touching, and Cyrus\u2019s head was close to his side. </p><p>Slowly, TJ laid back down, and stared at Cyrus\u2019s face. If he moved a few inches closer, he could press his lips to the other boy\u2019s forehead. TJ felt lightheaded. The more he looked at Cyrus, the more he noticed about him. Little details he had somehow missed before. The curve of his mouth, the slope of his nose, the shape of his ears. Every part of him was endearing, and it made it even harder for him to stop liking the boy. </p><p>Before he could think about his actions, TJ  moved his head forward and gently pressed his lips to Cyrus\u2019s forehead. He pulled away, scanning the other boy\u2019s face for a reaction. But there was none.</p><p>Until Cyrus shifted, and TJ rolled his sleeping bag across the floor and against the couch. </p><p>He squeezed his eyes shut as he heard the other boy stir. TJ tried to calm his breathing. Technically he hadn\u2019t done anything wrong. Friends could kiss their friends on the forehead, right? At least, that\u2019s what he\u2019d tell Cyrus if confronted. </p><p>TJ nearly jumped out of his skin at a light tap on his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cTJ? You awake?\u201d </p><p>TJ rolled over and faked a yawn.</p><p>\u201cI am now,\u201d he fake pouted. </p><p>Cyrus\u2019s face dropped. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry! I didn\u2019t mean to wake you.\u201d </p><p>\u201cHey, you\u2019re good.\u201d </p><p>TJ could feel Cyrus\u2019s eyes on him, so he pretended to examine the living room. </p><p>\u201cWe could make some chocolate chip pancakes for breakfast, if you want.\u201d</p><p>This seemed to perk Cyrus up.</p><p>\u201cYes please!\u201d </p><p>They made their way to the kitchen, their footsteps soft and calculated. TJ\u2019s moms usually slept in late, and he didn\u2019t want to wake them. </p><p>TJ pulled out a bowl and a box of pancake mix, then turned to Cyrus, who was still lingering in the door way.</p><p>\u201cYou ok?\u201d He asked, wondering if he had done something wrong. </p><p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s just- I\u2019ve never been a very good cook,\u201d Cyrus admitted, staring at the floor.</p><p>A flood of affection for him washed over TJ, and he came over and grabbed Cyrus by the hand.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll walk you through it.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus looked up at him, and TJ\u2019s breath caught in his throat.
