She had counted the time when that moment will happen, she had counted the years, months, weeks and even seconds. She had counted it all because she&rsquo;s been waiting for so long. But the time was always passing too slowly. She dreamed about it every night, writing a different story in her little mind just before she fell asleep. She daydreamed about meeting him or her every free time she got, dreaming about what those special first words might be. People laughed at her naivety and childish thoughts, but she had never given in, Y/N had never stopped believing. Even when that time had come, and the moment was almost over.</p><p>That day, that one specific morning, Y/N remembered giving her mother a kiss, pressing it gently on her freckled cheek, inhaling the sweet strawberries scent shampoo her mother had used the night before. She remembered pulling away, whispering a soft \u2018I love you\u2019 and giving her the tenderest smile for one more time. </p><p>She felt it. </p><p>That day, Y/N remembered tightly hugging her dad and sincerely laughing with him at the silly anecdote which was written in the newspaper that he was holding in his hands in that specific morning. She remembered exchanging those silent \u2018I love you\u2019s\u2019 and that lonely silver droplet rolling down her puffy red cheek as she finally turned away. </p><p>She knew it. </p><p>That day, Y/N remembered ruffling her little brother\u2019s hair and that playful glare he gave her afterward. She remembered letting out a soft gasp and a muffled giggle as he gently poked her belly in return, and that puzzled look on his face when he caught a short glimpse of her glassy eyes as she eventually made her way out of the house.</p><p>It broke her.</p><p>That day, Y/N remembered the silent sobs escaping her pink lips as she gently shut the door behind her, knowing she would never open it ever again. And oh, oh how much on that specific day she remembered hiding that broken heart as she silently said goodbye. </p><p>For her clock was already ticking. </p><p>They say in your time of dying you see your whole life flashing before your eyes. It wasn\u2019t very true to Y/N, but she did see something. The moments were blurry and it flashed as fast as lighting, giving just a split second to observe. But it was enough; it was enough for her to hold on just for one more minute. </p><p>That specific day, she remembered falling as the sharp pain pierced her skin. That day was the day she fell, but she fell with her head held high because she knew he was there to catch her. She remembered that unbearable pain shooting through her veins but having the strength to smile as she heard those special words that were only meant for her, the words that she so much dreamed of. She recollected feeling full.</p><p>\u201cMiss! Miss, you have to hold on! The help is on its way.\u201d The voice was soothing, even when it was filled with panic and worry. Y/N found it calming, just like her mother\u2019s voice which always managed to calm her down with a quieting lullaby when she couldn\u2019t sleep or the monsters from her nightmares were still haunting her. She felt safe as his tender arms gently cradling her head in his lap. \u201cMiss, please, open your eyes.\u201d</p><p>She did as she was told, her eyes fluttering open. For the first time in her life, her eyes finally were locked with her soulmate\u2019s big but narrowed white ones? She frowned slightly, her mouth shaping into a small \u2018o\u2019 form as she realized he was just wearing a mask, yet Y/N\u2019s eyes crinkled a little at the corners. She still thought he was beautiful, even when he was hiding his face. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re&hellip; y-you\u2019re him.\u201d Her voice came out faint and hoarse, but it wasn\u2019t it that made his heart beat faster, it wasn\u2019t it that made his blood run cold. No, it was her very first words said to him and those small black letters on her skin as she weakly showed him her wrist. It was that small round clock showing numbers that were darting so fast before his eyes. </p><p>He knew what it meant; they both it. And as much as he didn\u2019t want to believe it he knew there was nothing much left because the clock has never been broken and when that time comes, when the time runs out \u2013 it always stops at zero; No matter what.</p><p>\u201cCan I&hellip;\u201d Y/N grimaced in pain, her bottom lip trembling as she tried to reach his face with her fingers. \u201cMay I&hellip;\u201d But she couldn\u2019t finish her sentence; she didn\u2019t need to, because he understood her, he understood what she wanted.</p><p>\u201cYes, yes. Of course,\u201d He rapidly nodded his head and pulled off his mask, carelessly throwing it onto the ground. </p><p>The male underneath the mask was handsome. He had short brown hair which now was a little bit messy from the blowing wind. Yet it looked so soft that the lying girl just wanted to run her fingers through it. His eyes were a chocolate brown colour, holding so many emotions behind it. And his lips, oh his lips&hellip; it was thin and pink, looking so kissable. His skin was smooth as she gently ran her long fingers across his skin, her nails softly and shyly just for a moment grazing his lips. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cYour&hellip; your eyes are s-shinning.\u201d Y/N choked on her own blood as more tears threatened to stream down her cheeks. </p><p>\u201cGod,\u201d he sniffed, trying to blink away his tears. \u201cThis&hellip; this w-was not suppose to-to happen-\u201c his chocolate brown eyes darted from her eyes to the wound on her abdomen, where his palm was pressed, trying to lessen the bleeding. \u201cI\u2013I&rsquo;m so s-sorry. God this is all my f-fault&hellip;\u201d He sobbed, hugging her more tightly as he continued to apologize. </p><p>\u201cHey, h-hey,\u201d Y/N tried to get his attention and when she finally did, the dying girl smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. It\u2019s okay. It\u2019s perfect.\u201d She whimpered as tears rolled down her cheeks. \u201cT-there was nothing you could do&hellip;\u201d Her voice was barely above a whisper. \u201cThere is no escape from fate.\u201d </p><p>Soft cries could be heard as she tried so hard to breathe in, to hold on just for a few more seconds. \u201cI don\u2019t even know your name.\u201d \u00a0</p><p>\u201cY/N,\u201d She smiled through her tears and weakly placed her hand on his, her thumb gently caressing his skin. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not fair&hellip;\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s perfect.\u201d He clenched his jaw as her voice cracked. \u201cI\u2019m in the arms of my one and only; that\u2019s all that matters. I\u2019ve found what I\u2019ve been searching for all my life. I found you.\u201d \u00a0 \u00a0 </p><p>That day, in that specific moment, she remembered dying in her soulmate\u2019s arms as they both gazed at each other, as the clock stopped at zero, as she took her last breath, that single tear was rolling down her cheek because it was okay. It was perfect. It was enough. </p>",

She had counted the time when that moment will happen, she had counted the years, months, weeks and even seconds. She had counted it all because she\u2019s been waiting for so long. But the time was always passing too slowly. She dreamed about it every night, writing a different story in her little mind just before she fell asleep. She daydreamed about meeting him or her every free time she got, dreaming about what those special first words might be. People laughed at her naivety and childish thoughts, but she had never given in, Y/N had never stopped believing. Even when that time had come, and the moment was almost over.</p><p>That day, that one specific morning, Y/N remembered giving her mother a kiss, pressing it gently on her freckled cheek, inhaling the sweet strawberries scent shampoo her mother had used the night before. She remembered pulling away, whispering a soft \u2018I love you\u2019 and giving her the tenderest smile for one more time. </p><p>She felt it. </p><p>That day, Y/N remembered tightly hugging her dad and sincerely laughing with him at the silly anecdote which was written in the newspaper that he was holding in his hands in that specific morning.

She remembered letting out a soft gasp and a muffled giggle as he gently poked her belly in return, and that puzzled look on his face when he caught a short glimpse of her glassy eyes as she eventually made her way out of the house.</p><p>It broke her.</p><p>That day, Y/N remembered the silent sobs escaping her pink lips as she gently shut the door behind her, knowing she would never open it ever again. And oh, oh how much on that specific day she remembered hiding that broken heart as she silently said goodbye. </p><p>For her clock was already ticking. </p><p>They say in your time of dying you see your whole life flashing before your eyes. It wasn\u2019t very true to Y/N, but she did see something. The moments were blurry and it flashed as fast as lighting, giving just a split second to observe. But it was enough; it was enough for her to hold on just for one more minute. </p><p>That specific day, she remembered falling as the sharp pain pierced her skin. That day was the day she fell, but she fell with her head held high because she knew he was there to catch her. She remembered that unbearable pain shooting through her veins but having the strength to smile as she heard those special words that were only meant for her, the words that she so much dreamed of. She recollected feeling full.</p><p>\u201cMiss! Miss, you have to hold on! The help is on its way.\u201d The voice was soothing, even when it was filled with panic and worry. Y/N found it calming, just like her mother\u2019s voice which always managed to calm her down with a quieting lullaby when she couldn\u2019t sleep or the monsters from her nightmares were still haunting her. She felt safe as his tender arms gently cradling her head in his lap. \u201cMiss, please, open your eyes.\u201d</p><p>She did as she was told, her eyes fluttering open. For the first time in her life, her eyes finally were locked with her soulmate\u2019s big but narrowed white ones? She frowned slightly, her mouth shaping into a small \u2018o\u2019 form as she realized he was just wearing a mask, yet Y/N\u2019s eyes crinkled a little at the corners. She still thought he was beautiful, even when he was hiding his face. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re\u2026 y-you\u2019re him.\u201d Her voice came out faint and hoarse, but it wasn\u2019t it that made his heart beat faster, it wasn\u2019t it that made his blood run cold. No, it was her very first words said to him and those small black letters on her skin as she weakly showed him her wrist. It was that small round clock showing numbers that were darting so fast before his eyes. </p><p>He knew what it meant; they both it. And as much as he didn\u2019t want to believe it he knew there was nothing much left because the clock has never been broken and when that time comes, when the time runs out \u2013 it always stops at zero; No matter what.</p><p>\u201cCan I\u2026\u201d Y/N grimaced in pain, her bottom lip trembling as she tried to reach his face with her fingers. \u201cMay I\u2026\u201d But she couldn\u2019t finish her sentence; she didn\u2019t need to, because he understood her, he understood what she wanted.</p><p>\u201cYes, yes.

        "body": "<p>(Y/N) was on her way home from helping her mother-in-law out at this gathering she was hosting a gold club for the Hollands Trust charity. It was a casual event for woman which (Y/N) was excited to attend, but was also speaking at. Tom caught a glimpse of her beautiful blue dress this morning, which reached down just below her knees. He couldn\u2019t stop thinking about how great his wife looked all day</p><p><b>7: 00 PM</b></p><p>When she entered the flat things were too quiet.</p><p>\u201cHoney, I\u2019m home!\u201d She called out, but there was no answer. (Y/N) placed her coat on the rack and then took of her shoes. The woman walked straight to the bedroom where she heard muffled talking.</p><p>When she opened the door, her mouth dropped and she couldn\u2019t believe her eyes.</p><p><b>15 Minutes Earlier</b></p><p><b><i>Toms POV</i></b></p><p>Tom was cooking dinner for (Y/N) since she knew his wife was spending time with his mother which made him happy.</p><p>He was making lasagna with some garlic bread along with some red wine for the both of them. Tom knew she was going to be home in a bit so he was in the finishing stages of the dinner when all of a sudden, the doorbell rang.</p><p>He wiped his hands on a cloth before setting everything down. The man ran over to the door and once he opened it, his eyes went wide.</p><p>\u201cHello Tom.\u201d It was none other than Pamela.</p><p>Pam, the woman staying over at their flat because she was a close friend of (Y/N)\u2019s mother and growing up she would always be around. She was super sweet and loved (Y/N) as her own daughter, but Pam was also very attractive. Blonde hair and a slim body which could pull off practically any look. She was also smart and funny. Pam basically had it all, but always dressed to impress.</p><p>(Y/N) knew that all the boys had a crush on Pam, even Dom. But thought that she would never do anything to jeopardize any relationship.</p><p>\u201cUm, hi Pam. (Y/N) should be home any minute so come in and have a seat.\u201d Tom invited the woman who was half his age inside.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Pam said as she entered the flat. Tom shut the door behind her leaving it unlocked for his wife.</p><p>\u201cAre you making something? It smells delicious.\u201d Pamela said as she took off her coat.</p><p>\u201cOh yeah, I am going to surprise (Y/N) with a special dinner I made for the two of us. By the way, can you watch the stove? I\u2019m just going to go get something from the bedroom.\u201d Tom asked and Pam nodded with a smile.</p><p>Tom smiled in return and then ran to the bedroom to get changed for (Y/N). He wanted to look good and make it romantic for his wife. The guy couldn\u2019t be more excited to see her reaction.</p><p>He took off his shirt and laid out a white dress shirt across the bed and smiled as he imagined how his wife would react.</p><p>All of a sudden, the door opened and Pam walked in. Tom got very startled and freaked out grabbing a towel and wrapping it around himself.</p><p>\u201cOh, Tom, sorry. I was just coming into say that the lasagna was ready and hot.\u201d She said and Tom stood there nervously.</p><p>\u201cOkay, thanks. Um, I\u2019ll be out in a few seconds.\u201d He said slightly embarrassed.\u00a0</p><p>Pam bit her lip and stepped into the room shutting the door behind her with her foot. She slowly walked towards Tom seductively. The guy didn\u2019t know what to do, he was panicking inside.

Tom is innocent and I admit that. I am so sorry, (Y/N). I don&rsquo;t know what came over me.&rdquo; Pam said as she approached them.</p><p>Tom was relieved, but also heartbroken at the sight of his wife.</p><p>&ldquo;I promise, that&rsquo;s all true.&rdquo; Tom said and (Y/N) shook her head.</p><p>&ldquo;If I wasn&rsquo;t here, what would&rsquo;ve happened?&rdquo; She asked clenching her teeth together as a few tears ran down her face.</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Pam asked taking a few steps towards them.</p><p>(Y/N) looked at her with the angriest expression like she was about to attack and then she looked back at Tom and the expression wiped off her face into sadness.</p><p>&ldquo;What would&rsquo;ve happened if I wasn&rsquo;t here, Tom?&rdquo; She asked and wasn&rsquo;t playing any games.</p><p>&ldquo;Nothing, love. I would never ever cheat on you.&rdquo; Tom said and (Y/N) wasn&rsquo;t having it.</p><p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo; (Y/N)&rsquo;s tears had stopped at this point and she just looked frustrated and angry.</p><p>&ldquo;Tom is a good guy (Y/N), he really loves you and would never do anything to hurt you. That I know for a fact. You can hate me all you want, I understand that. But Tom, he&rsquo;d never hurt you.&rdquo; Pamela said and then tears started to form in Tom&rsquo;s eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;(Y/N) you are my everything, I would never ever hurt you by cheating. I will never be that type of guy because I love and respect you, so much. Please, you have to believe me.&rdquo; He took his hand in hers and it was like he was begging for his life. Tom couldn&rsquo;t stand the idea of him ever loosing (Y/N).</p><p>She was his entire world, the person who kept him grounded and inspired him to never give up on the important things in life. The individual who was his other half, his equal. He couldn&rsquo;t stand the thought of letting go of her.</p><p>&ldquo;I love you Mrs. Holland, forever.&rdquo; Tom said and kissed the tip of her hand where her wedding ring is located.</p><p>&ldquo;I love you too, Mr. Holland.&rdquo; She said and wrapped her arms around his neck.</p><p>&ldquo;I promise I would never cheat, nothing happened here tonight and nothing was going to happen.&rdquo; Tom whispered in her ear and then kissed her cheek. She cried into his shoulder and looked up at Pam standing behind him.</p><p>&ldquo;Get out!&rdquo; (Y/N) said and then Pam ran for the door and (Y/N) followed behind her.</p><p>&ldquo;If you ever make a move on my husband or any other guy I know who&rsquo;s in a relationship, you&rsquo;ll be dealing with me and trust me, you don&rsquo;t want that!&rdquo; (Y/N) said and then slammed the door on her face locking it afterwards.</p><p>&ldquo;That was so hot,&rdquo; Tom said and then she smiled and kissed him.</p><p>&ldquo;Now, I have a surprise for you my love.&rdquo; He said and walked her over to the table where he seated her.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re in for a romantic evening, Mrs. Holland.&rdquo; He said and then his wife smiled. &nbsp;</p>",
