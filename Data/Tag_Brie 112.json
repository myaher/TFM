Walking out of that afterwards was just so inspiring. I felt like a boss ass bitch. Like I can do anything and fuck anyone who says I can&rsquo;t. I think Wonder Woman was very well known for being a woman empowering and inspiring movie, and I have to say I enjoyed that movie. But the thing about Captain Marvel is that she wasn&rsquo;t just some goddess sculpted from clay. Literally. She was human. She experienced being told that things aren&rsquo;t girl things to do and she experienced being pushed to the side because she was a girl. That&rsquo;s something that I think every girl experienced at least once, but it was ignored and everyone just said it was a part of growing up. Idk why that affected me so much but it really did. It shines a spotlight on things that people haven&rsquo;t really thought about. Another thing I LOVE LOVE LOVE is that there&rsquo;s no romatic interest. No distractions. Just  her trying to do the right thing and save the fucking universe. Yeah, you go girl. And also, Carol Danvers was literally just fantastic. Seriously. I mean her foot is gonna go so far up that ugly eggplant&rsquo;s giant purple ass. So yeah. I wrote this completely on a whim but I just wanted to share some thoughts \ud83d\ude02</p>",

        "body": "<p>So I just went to see Marvel\u2019s Captain Marvel and I have some opinions. Repeat, these are opinions. You are free to disagree with me if you so desire. I respect your decision, and I simply wish to tell you that this is not an objective dissection of this film. But before I do, I will be warning you (obviously) Spoilers Ahead. I will be putting this under the cut.</p><p>Other thing I\u2019m warning of this (I cannot believe I\u2019m doing this). I know this film has been having some controversy. And frankly I don\u2019t give a shit. As someone has actually, y\u2019know, watched the movie, I can say nothing about the controversy seems to have any effect on this film, nor should it. I\u2019m saying my piece as a film goer.</p><p>So one last time spoilers ahead. You have been warned.</p><!-- more --><p>So before I talk about the film proper. I would like to give my general opinions the comic Captain Marvel Carol Danvers. I love her. I love Carol Danvers as character, she, in my opinion, is Marvel\u2019s Wonder Woman. Her no nonsense attitude, but compassionate heart, would make for a great character in a solo film. As well as add some much needed diversity in terms personality in Marvel\u2019s cast (Trust me, I was relieved by Black Panther actually not making jokes and being primarily serious).<br/></p><p>I should also say, I love Marvel Cosmic. Seriously, Marvel\u2019s cosmic stuff is so creative and you better believe I\u2019m all for seeing them finally come to the big screen. To see the Kree and Skrull finally fight on the big screen, hell yeah. I was expecting the adaptation to have changes because getting the concept of the Cotati and the Celestials. But as long as its done well, it can work.</p><p>And boy oh boy, this movie was kinda underwhelming. Yeah, its not even like backlash hype, but this movie was kinda boring. It says something when during the first third of the film I checked my phone\u2019s time. Yeah&hellip; Not a great sign. I do wanna say this though, the film does pick up after the first act. Like really it improves as it goes on, but boy is it bit of a hump.</p><p>Again, I wanna make this clear. This movie is fine. I recall people walking out of the theater saying I liked it. And as this is a marvel movie, it is better than other genuinely bad movies. But unfortunately as it isn\u2019t strong one way or the other, its not in the best area. I didn\u2019t mind that I saw it. For something to do for 2 hours it was nice. It got a few good laughs out of me. But boy this was&hellip; Kinda textbook Marvel film.</p><p>Okay, people have a tendency to say Marvel\u2019s too formulaic or its too childish at times. And this movie fixes that. Oh not by twisting those formulas on its head like Black Panther. No it does the formula and removes most of charm. Yeah, this movie is Marvel films distilled. Everything in this film, you have seen done somewhere else, and done better.</p><p>Okay maybe I should get into the story. The story is again fine. It almost feels like a syfy channel original at times. And maybe that comes from the fact this movie had 5 writers and 2 directors. Cause boy this film is all over the place.</p><p>At first it seems like its all Kree vs Skrull, but its never really elaborated on why. There is no bitter history or reason other than they are skrull. Which is weird cause this film is exposition heavy. There\u2019s one moment that sticks out and that was Monica telling Carol about her dad and her having a bad relationship. Now granted we saw a glimpse of this during one of many flashing sequences, but its never truly let sink. Its just the bare minimum. And Carol\u2019s relationship with her dad and how he treated her is a big part of who she is.<br/></p><p>But back to the juggling plots, when Carol lands on earth it seems like they wanna go the Thor 1 route while also there being a secret invasion. Which could work. Y\u2019know, start of with the war, then Carol is trying to stop the invading Skrull who are planning on using the earth. But then it becomes a McGuffin run. Where the skrull apparently only want this lightspeed engine, and Carol must stop them cause&hellip; Skrull.</p><p>But then it turns out the Skrull are actually the victims this whole time and we need to get them off here before the Kree kill them. And I\u2019m sure your asking, \u201cwhat is even the point of this already?\u201d</p><p>And that\u2019s just the thing. This film is trying to be clever, but simultaneously, its really behind the times. Its almost fitting this is in the 90s as this feels like a 90s family movie. Its just so bland. Like got this ship dog fight in a canyon, its got the friend who lets the heroes go when they are suspects, and its got the whole, I was originally from here by looking at a photograph. By trying to be many things, it end up being nothing. Its just kinda okay. Not a bad movie, but when you\u2019re in phase 3, this is shockingly more.</p><p>If this was like phase 1, maybe. But if you are expecting a Wonder Woman style film, this one is blown out of the water by WW. And I\u2019m a guy who\u2019s Marvel leaning when it comes to comics. But no Marvel, banking on this, its outdated.</p><p>In terms of characters, lets talk about Carol herself and her performance. Brie Larson is not a bad actress, but boy&hellip; The problem with her in this film is that Carol isn\u2019t consistent in characterization. There are times in this film where I\u2019m like, \u201cAmazing, you got Carol.\u201d Then there are times where she acts like a generic marvel protag. And then there are time \u201cyou really wanna go with that take?\u201d <br/></p><p>A wise word I heard was that how you know someone is the right fit for a marvel hero is you can see no one else playing that role. You can\u2019t see Nick Fury not being played by Samuel L Jackson, you can\u2019t see Iron Man not being played by Robert Downey Jr. etc. And unfortunately, I can see Carol being played by someone else. And it didn\u2019t help that person was in this film. <br/></p><p>Lashana Lynch\n\nacted her ass off in this film and was a better Carol Danvers than Carol Danvers. She played Maria \n Rambeau\n\n(Though really she\u2019s playing Monica Rambeau in spirit, but given the time period, Monica is actually a little girl, but Maria acts exactly how you\u2019d expect Monica to act from the comics and wibbily wobbly timey wimey) who is acting circles around Larson. She\u2019s allowed to be very human while express a full range of emotions. While Carol is just kinda bland. (Also doesn\u2019t help Monica was actually captain marvel before carol while she was still Miss Marvel) So if that\u2019s one thing this movie got me eager for, it\u2019s Monica Rambeau in the MCU.<br/></p><p>Sam Jackson does a great job and is basically the linchpin of comedy in this movie. Yeah this movie\u2019s humor is kinda non existent for a while. Again, it gets better as the film goes, but its again a slog. That said, Jackson handles the roles like a champ and is doing his best.</p><p>Talos was actually doing pretty good as a villain. He\u2019s not Loki or Vulture, but he\u2019s closer to Darren Cross from Ant Man. Having fun, while trying to be menacing. But he\u2019s not a villain. Literally, the twist in this movie is the Kree were bad this whole time. Even though the point of the kree-skrull conflict is that both sides are wrong, nope. Skrull are the victims and they\u2019re refugees. Christ, this movie basically told me, \u201cYeah, you\u2019re never getting super skrull or a good secret invasion.\u201d Christ.</p><p>All in all he turns in my favrite performance, but his Jason Statham impression is kinda distracting. I really think he could\u2019ve been a good adversary in a better script.</p><p>No are real villain is Yon and he is basically \nKaecilius\n\nfrom Doctor Strange. He\u2019s Carol\u2019s handler, he does that whole, playful banter while fighting thing. Then he disappears from film. Then it turns out that he\u2019s the one who shot down Carol and that he\u2019s the real villain. And he is not interesting.</p><p>Kinda comes with the fact that you literally didn\u2019t make this twist until the end of the second act. So we have no strong impression of him as a character. Hell there is also his squad who fights Carol and its basically like watching the Black Order fight but blue. Its boring.</p><p>Oh there is the supreme intelligence. And that\u2019s done so weird too. It projects itself int whatever form the person holds dearest (For Carol its Mar-Vell) and that seems like a great thing. Using the skin of a loved one, but in reality being nothing than cold unfeeling pragmatism. But then they start acting really gitty and emotional when they go into carol\u2019s head again. This should be horrifying. This is just Jeff Goldbloom as the Grand Master lite.</p><p>Ronan also shows up in this movie. And he\u2019s not the main villain! You have this chance to make Ronan (one of the most universally thought poor villain) and make him better. It would make a larger tapestry in films as we know what he\u2019s like in guardians, but I would\u2019ve like to see him before this. Show the seeds of just someone overtly self righteous that would bloom into zealous. I feel like this film could be much better with replacing Yon with Ronan.</p><p>But nope, in this film he\u2019s just some asshole who is on screen for like 5 minutes. Oh but he\u2019s got this group called the accusors that bomb out Skrull. Which also leads to this plot hole, why did Carol think that the Skrull caused ruins on the planet she visited? We saw her squad arrive while Ronan was bombing!</p><p>Then we have Mar-vell. Mar-vell is a woman this time and I was fine with that. She\u2019s a good actress, if not enough time with her. Also the cause of Carol\u2019s powers is the tesseract. Sure. Makes more sense.</p><p>I\u2019ve been sounding lime a dick for a while, so I\u2019ll quickly list off the good stuff in this film. I like the color pallet. I actually think Carol dressing in the grundge outfit is cool. I love goose. I think Talos and his family\u2019s scenes are adorable. And I think the scene where Carol stands back up is empowering, but god I wish it was in a better film.<br/></p><p>All in all, this film is fine. But its so on the bland side. And that leaves me in a wierd place. I want this film to do well, mainly cause I know how board executives work. \u201cOh a female superhero movie wasn\u2019t profitable? Guess no more female superhero films.\u201d And that\u2019s not the case. We saw with Wonder Woman that you can do a female super hero movie, just get good writing and good directing. I want more females in Marvel movies. I want a damn Black Widow movie for christ sake!</p><p>But at the same time, I kinda want Marvel to take the L on this one. I want them to see that doing the bare minimum isn\u2019t going to fly in the this oversatured market. Marvel was the best and only game in town for 10 years. But now. DC has clawed its way up, Wonder Woman was good, Aquaman was good, Shazam looks good, etc. And they all seem to want to try something new while being good. Marvel, you need to step it up. Because you\u2019ll soon not be top dog anymore.</p><p>I feel like this film would\u2019ve benefited from a director like \nTaika Waititi. Someone who knows how to take the fantastical of Marvel cosmic and\u00a0 make it come to life. I also think it needs one writer. You though Justice League was bad as it feels like it was done by two different films directed by two different people, well this feel the same.</p><p>Is it bad. No. Its basically ghostbuster 2016. Its not bad, its not good. Not seeing seeing this film doesn\u2019t make you a misogynist, seeing this this film does make you an asshole who is betraying the comics. Am I going to think less of you if you like this, god no! Am I saying its drek? No I still enjoyed the 2 hours I used up to watch this movie. So ball\u2019s your court folks.<br/></p>",

I\u2019m saying my piece as a film goer.</p><p>So one last time spoilers ahead. You have been warned.</p>[[MORE]]<p>So before I talk about the film proper. I would like to give my general opinions the comic Captain Marvel Carol Danvers. I love her. I love Carol Danvers as character, she, in my opinion, is Marvel\u2019s Wonder Woman. Her no nonsense attitude, but compassionate heart, would make for a great character in a solo film. As well as add some much needed diversity in terms personality in Marvel\u2019s cast (Trust me, I was relieved by Black Panther actually not making jokes and being primarily serious).<br></p><p>I should also say, I love Marvel Cosmic. Seriously, Marvel\u2019s cosmic stuff is so creative and you better believe I\u2019m all for seeing them finally come to the big screen. To see the Kree and Skrull finally fight on the big screen, hell yeah. I was expecting the adaptation to have changes because getting the concept of the Cotati and the Celestials. But as long as its done well, it can work.</p><p>And boy oh boy, this movie was kinda underwhelming. Yeah, its not even like backlash hype, but this movie was kinda boring. It says something when during the first third of the film I checked my phone\u2019s time. Yeah\u2026 Not a great sign. I do wanna say this though, the film does pick up after the first act. Like really it improves as it goes on, but boy is it bit of a hump.</p><p>Again, I wanna make this clear. This movie is fine. I recall people walking out of the theater saying I liked it. And as this is a marvel movie, it is better than other genuinely bad movies. But unfortunately as it isn\u2019t strong one way or the other, its not in the best area. I didn\u2019t mind that I saw it. For something to do for 2 hours it was nice. It got a few good laughs out of me. But boy this was\u2026 Kinda textbook Marvel film.</p><p>Okay, people have a tendency to say Marvel\u2019s too formulaic or its too childish at times. And this movie fixes that. Oh not by twisting those formulas on its head like Black Panther. No it does the formula and removes most of charm. Yeah, this movie is Marvel films distilled. Everything in this film, you have seen done somewhere else, and done better.</p><p>Okay maybe I should get into the story. The story is again fine. It almost feels like a syfy channel original at times. And maybe that comes from the fact this movie had 5 writers and 2 directors. Cause boy this film is all over the place.</p><p>At first it seems like its all Kree vs Skrull, but its never really elaborated on why. There is no bitter history or reason other than they are skrull. Which is weird cause this film is exposition heavy. There\u2019s one moment that sticks out and that was Monica telling Carol about her dad and her having a bad relationship. Now granted we saw a glimpse of this during one of many flashing sequences, but its never truly let sink. Its just the bare minimum. And Carol\u2019s relationship with her dad and how he treated her is a big part of who she is.<br></p><p>But back to the juggling plots, when Carol lands on earth it seems like they wanna go the Thor 1 route while also there being a secret invasion.

It almost feels like a syfy channel original at times. And maybe that comes from the fact this movie had 5 writers and 2 directors. Cause boy this film is all over the place.</p><p>At first it seems like its all Kree vs Skrull, but its never really elaborated on why. There is no bitter history or reason other than they are skrull. Which is weird cause this film is exposition heavy. There\u2019s one moment that sticks out and that was Monica telling Carol about her dad and her having a bad relationship. Now granted we saw a glimpse of this during one of many flashing sequences, but its never truly let sink. Its just the bare minimum. And Carol\u2019s relationship with her dad and how he treated her is a big part of who she is.<br></p><p>But back to the juggling plots, when Carol lands on earth it seems like they wanna go the Thor 1 route while also there being a secret invasion. Which could work. Y\u2019know, start of with the war, then Carol is trying to stop the invading Skrull who are planning on using the earth. But then it becomes a McGuffin run. Where the skrull apparently only want this lightspeed engine, and Carol must stop them cause\u2026 Skrull.</p><p>But then it turns out the Skrull are actually the victims this whole time and we need to get them off here before the Kree kill them. And I\u2019m sure your asking, \u201cwhat is even the point of this already?\u201d</p><p>And that\u2019s just the thing. This film is trying to be clever, but simultaneously, its really behind the times. Its almost fitting this is in the 90s as this feels like a 90s family movie. Its just so bland. Like got this ship dog fight in a canyon, its got the friend who lets the heroes go when they are suspects, and its got the whole, I was originally from here by looking at a photograph. By trying to be many things, it end up being nothing. Its just kinda okay. Not a bad movie, but when you\u2019re in phase 3, this is shockingly more.</p><p>If this was like phase 1, maybe. But if you are expecting a Wonder Woman style film, this one is blown out of the water by WW. And I\u2019m a guy who\u2019s Marvel leaning when it comes to comics. But no Marvel, banking on this, its outdated.</p><p>In terms of characters, lets talk about Carol herself and her performance. Brie Larson is not a bad actress, but boy\u2026 The problem with her in this film is that Carol isn\u2019t consistent in characterization. There are times in this film where I\u2019m like, \u201cAmazing, you got Carol.\u201d Then there are times where she acts like a generic marvel protag. And then there are time \u201cyou really wanna go with that take?\u201d <br></p><p>A wise word I heard was that how you know someone is the right fit for a marvel hero is you can see no one else playing that role. You can\u2019t see Nick Fury not being played by Samuel L Jackson, you can\u2019t see Iron Man not being played by Robert Downey Jr. etc. And unfortunately, I can see Carol being played by someone else. And it didn\u2019t help that person was in this film. <br></p><p>Lashana Lynch\n\nacted her ass off in this film and was a better Carol Danvers than Carol Danvers. She played Maria \n Rambeau\n\n(Though really she\u2019s playing Monica Rambeau in spirit, but given the time period, Monica is actually a little girl, but Maria acts exactly how you\u2019d expect Monica to act from the comics and wibbily wobbly timey wimey) who is acting circles around Larson. She\u2019s allowed to be very human while express a full range of emotions. While Carol is just kinda bland. (Also doesn\u2019t help Monica was actually captain marvel before carol while she was still Miss Marvel) So if that\u2019s one thing this movie got me eager for, it\u2019s Monica Rambeau in the MCU.<br></p><p>Sam Jackson does a great job and is basically the linchpin of comedy in this movie. Yeah this movie\u2019s humor is kinda non existent for a while. Again, it gets better as the film goes, but its again a slog. That said, Jackson handles the roles like a champ and is doing his best.</p><p>Talos was actually doing pretty good as a villain. He\u2019s not Loki or Vulture, but he\u2019s closer to Darren Cross from Ant Man. Having fun, while trying to be menacing. But he\u2019s not a villain. Literally, the twist in this movie is the Kree were bad this whole time. Even though the point of the kree-skrull conflict is that both sides are wrong, nope. Skrull are the victims and they\u2019re refugees. Christ, this movie basically told me, \u201cYeah, you\u2019re never getting super skrull or a good secret invasion.\u201d Christ.</p><p>All in all he turns in my favrite performance, but his Jason Statham impression is kinda distracting. I really think he could\u2019ve been a good adversary in a better script.</p><p>No are real villain is Yon and he is basically \nKaecilius\n\nfrom Doctor Strange. He\u2019s Carol\u2019s handler, he does that whole, playful banter while fighting thing. Then he disappears from film. Then it turns out that he\u2019s the one who shot down Carol and that he\u2019s the real villain. And he is not interesting.</p><p>Kinda comes with the fact that you literally didn\u2019t make this twist until the end of the second act. So we have no strong impression of him as a character. Hell there is also his squad who fights Carol and its basically like watching the Black Order fight but blue. Its boring.</p><p>Oh there is the supreme intelligence. And that\u2019s done so weird too. It projects itself int whatever form the person holds dearest (For Carol its Mar-Vell) and that seems like a great thing. Using the skin of a loved one, but in reality being nothing than cold unfeeling pragmatism. But then they start acting really gitty and emotional when they go into carol\u2019s head again. This should be horrifying. This is just Jeff Goldbloom as the Grand Master lite.</p><p>Ronan also shows up in this movie. And he\u2019s not the main villain! You have this chance to make Ronan (one of the most universally thought poor villain) and make him better. It would make a larger tapestry in films as we know what he\u2019s like in guardians, but I would\u2019ve like to see him before this. Show the seeds of just someone overtly self righteous that would bloom into zealous. I feel like this film could be much better with replacing Yon with Ronan.</p><p>But nope, in this film he\u2019s just some asshole who is on screen for like 5 minutes. Oh but he\u2019s got this group called the accusors that bomb out Skrull. Which also leads to this plot hole, why did Carol think that the Skrull caused ruins on the planet she visited? We saw her squad arrive while Ronan was bombing!</p><p>Then we have Mar-vell. Mar-vell is a woman this time and I was fine with that. She\u2019s a good actress, if not enough time with her. Also the cause of Carol\u2019s powers is the tesseract. Sure. Makes more sense.</p><p>I\u2019ve been sounding lime a dick for a while, so I\u2019ll quickly list off the good stuff in this film. I like the color pallet. I actually think Carol dressing in the grundge outfit is cool. I love goose. I think Talos and his family\u2019s scenes are adorable. And I think the scene where Carol stands back up is empowering, but god I wish it was in a better film.<br></p><p>All in all, this film is fine. But its so on the bland side. And that leaves me in a wierd place. I want this film to do well, mainly cause I know how board executives work. \u201cOh a female superhero movie wasn\u2019t profitable? Guess no more female superhero films.\u201d And that\u2019s not the case. We saw with Wonder Woman that you can do a female super hero movie, just get good writing and good directing. I want more females in Marvel movies. I want a damn Black Widow movie for christ sake!</p><p>But at the same time, I kinda want Marvel to take the L on this one. I want them to see that doing the bare minimum isn\u2019t going to fly in the this oversatured market. Marvel was the best and only game in town for 10 years. But now. DC has clawed its way up, Wonder Woman was good, Aquaman was good, Shazam looks good, etc. And they all seem to want to try something new while being good. Marvel, you need to step it up. Because you\u2019ll soon not be top dog anymore.</p><p>I feel like this film would\u2019ve benefited from a director like \nTaika Waititi. Someone who knows how to take the fantastical of Marvel cosmic and\u00a0 make it come to life. I also think it needs one writer. You though Justice League was bad as it feels like it was done by two different films directed by two different people, well this feel the same.</p><p>Is it bad. No. Its basically ghostbuster 2016. Its not bad, its not good. Not seeing seeing this film doesn\u2019t make you a misogynist, seeing this this film does make you an asshole who is betraying the comics. Am I going to think less of you if you like this, god no! Am I saying its drek? No I still enjoyed the 2 hours I used up to watch this movie. So ball\u2019s your court folks.<br></p>",
                "content": "<p>So I just went to see Marvel&rsquo;s Captain Marvel and I have some opinions. Repeat, these are opinions. You are free to disagree with me if you so desire. I respect your decision, and I simply wish to tell you that this is not an objective dissection of this film. But before I do, I will be warning you (obviously) Spoilers Ahead. I will be putting this under the cut.</p><p>Other thing I&rsquo;m warning of this (I cannot believe I&rsquo;m doing this). I know this film has been having some controversy. And frankly I don&rsquo;t give a shit. As someone has actually, y&rsquo;know, watched the movie, I can say nothing about the controversy seems to have any effect on this film, nor should it. I&rsquo;m saying my piece as a film goer.</p><p>So one last time spoilers ahead. You have been warned.</p><p>So before I talk about the film proper. I would like to give my general opinions the comic Captain Marvel Carol Danvers. I love her. I love Carol Danvers as character, she, in my opinion, is Marvel&rsquo;s Wonder Woman. Her no nonsense attitude, but compassionate heart, would make for a great character in a solo film. As well as add some much needed diversity in terms personality in Marvel&rsquo;s cast (Trust me, I was relieved by Black Panther actually not making jokes and being primarily serious).<br /></p><p>I should also say, I love Marvel Cosmic. Seriously, Marvel&rsquo;s cosmic stuff is so creative and you better believe I&rsquo;m all for seeing them finally come to the big screen. To see the Kree and Skrull finally fight on the big screen, hell yeah. I was expecting the adaptation to have changes because getting the concept of the Cotati and the Celestials. But as long as its done well, it can work.</p><p>And boy oh boy, this movie was kinda underwhelming. Yeah, its not even like backlash hype, but this movie was kinda boring. It says something when during the first third of the film I checked my phone&rsquo;s time. Yeah&hellip; Not a great sign. I do wanna say this though, the film does pick up after the first act. Like really it improves as it goes on, but boy is it bit of a hump.</p><p>Again, I wanna make this clear. This movie is fine. I recall people walking out of the theater saying I liked it. And as this is a marvel movie, it is better than other genuinely bad movies. But unfortunately as it isn&rsquo;t strong one way or the other, its not in the best area. I didn&rsquo;t mind that I saw it. For something to do for 2 hours it was nice. It got a few good laughs out of me. But boy this was&hellip; Kinda textbook Marvel film.</p><p>Okay, people have a tendency to say Marvel&rsquo;s too formulaic or its too childish at times. And this movie fixes that. Oh not by twisting those formulas on its head like Black Panther. No it does the formula and removes most of charm. Yeah, this movie is Marvel films distilled. Everything in this film, you have seen done somewhere else, and done better.</p><p>Okay maybe I should get into the story. The story is again fine.
