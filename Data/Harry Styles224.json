The\nroom was decorated with elegant jewelleries and ornaments. People were dancing\nand drinking with their friends and their partners. But, Y/N stood there alone,\nwith her own glass of Champaign, wearing an expensive short dress of her own;\nilluminated under the chandelier above her. Her gaze was fixed at a particular\nman standing at the far corner of the room talking to few of his friends.</p><p>Y/N didn\u2019t know how long she was standing there, looking at him. However,\nthe time she spotted him - she wasn\u2019t tipsy and her elbows and shoulder didn\u2019t\nhurt for leaning on the bar counter for so long.</p><p>Harry, he was so gorgeous. His forest green eyes, his sizzled cheek bones,\nhis defined jaw, his fluffy hair - he was just so gorgeous.</p><p>Suddenly, he looked on his left and his eyes fell on her. That was the third\ntime that night she was caught staring. But, that didn\u2019t make her get used to\nhis soft yet stern; light yet steely gaze, nor did it make her look away from\nhim. Y/N waved with confidence, a smile fixed on her face but her knees- they\nwere going weak and her heart- it was beating thousand miles a minute.</p><p>Harry waved back just like he did last two times before going back to his\nconversation. Even from this far Y/N could tell he was confused and even from\nthis far she sensed the little excitement and happiness, he exerted after that.</p><p>\u201cYou like him.\u201d</p><p>A sudden voice snapped Y/N out of her thoughts. Y/N looked on her side. It\nwas Mia, her best friend and her colleague. However, she wasn\u2019t looking at her,\nshe was looking at the man Y/N was looking at</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Y/N asked trying to act confused.</p><p>\u201cHarry, you\u2019ve been looking at him non-stop from the past hour,\u201d\nshe said as she turned around leaning her front on the bar counter, Y/N\nfollowed suit.</p><p><i>You should take it as a compliment </i></p><p><i>That I got drunk and made fun of the way you talk</i></p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like him! I just think he talks in a funny way,\u201d Y/N\nreplied as she put a hand on her upper abdomen and moved her other hand in the\nair in attempt of copying him.</p><p>\u201cWhatever you say, but remember he\u2019s older than you, a lot older than\nyou\u201d Mia said in a sing song voice before walking away to her boyfriend\nwho was waving at her.</p><p>\u201cI talk like that?\u201d A very familiar yet foreign voice spoke from\nbehind, startling Y/N.</p><p>\u201cOh, jeez, you scared me,\u201d Y/N said putting a hand on her chest\nbut looking away from him, nonetheless. Seeing him from far made her heart beat\nlike it\u2019s in a marathon and having him just few inches away from her, she felt\nher heart was going to beat out of her chest as her palms got sweaty, her mind\nfuzzy while she felt her face heat up.</p><p><i>You\u2019re so gorgeous I can\u2019t say anything to your face </i></p><p><i>\u2018Cause look at your face</i></p><p>\u201cI talk like that?\u201d Harry said again before ordering a drink for\nhimself.</p><p>\u201cUm, yeah uh - a little,\u201d Y/N stuttered looking at Harry for a\nbrief second and looked down again. \u201cBut, I didn\u2019t mean it that way, I was\njust I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p><i>You should think about the consequence </i></p><p><i>Of your magnetic field being a little too strong</i></p><p>Y/N looked up again. He was looking at her with an amused look on his face\nas his eyes sparkled under the dim light. Y/N, however she just wanted to run\naway from him and get into the safety of her house or the bathroom of the house\nshe was in currently, but she couldn\u2019t. She felt like he was pulling her like a\nmagnet and staying even two inches away from him was hard for her.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry people tell me that all the time,\u201d Harry hadn\u2019t torn\nhis gaze away from her at all. And Y/N could tell he was enjoying seeing Y/N\ngetting all worked up under his gaze.</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t change it though,\u201d Y/N looked away taking a sip\nfrom her wine. \u201cI think it\u2019s adorable.\u201d</p><p>Her head snapped at Harry\u2019s direction. Her eyes went wide as she clasped her\nhand on her mouth realizing what she just said making Harry chuckle out loud.\n\u201cOh God, I didn\u2019t mean it like that. I shouldn\u2019t have said that.\u201d</p><p><i>He was her senior - by age, by career -was she fucking stupid!</i></p><p>\u201cThen what you meant?\u201d Harry laughed.</p><p><i>Forest Green eyes looking in mine </i></p><p><i>I feel like I might sink and drown and die</i></p><p>\u201cUh, I, um-\u201d Harry raised his eyebrows at Y/N making her quickly\nlook away again. Y/N could never maintain an eye contact with him more than two\nminutes; looking at his green orbs just made her feel she would sink, drown and\neventually die in them.</p><p><i>And you should think about the consequence </i></p><p><i>Of you touching my hand in a darkened room</i></p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Y/N quickly replied as she played with the glass\nin her hand filled with Champaign. Harry hummed next to her. Before they could\nsay anything else and before Y/N could get any more nervous the lights went out\nas the countdown started for the new year.</p><p>\u201c10.\u201d</p><p>\u201c9.\u201d</p><p>\u201c8.\u201d</p><p>\u201c7.\u201d</p><p>\u201c6.\u201d</p><p>\u201c5.\u201d</p><p>Electricity ran through Y/N\u2019s vein as she felt a hand brush hers ever so\nlightly.</p><p>\u201c4.\u201d</p><p>Y/N looked down, even in the dark Y/N could make out Harry\u2019s tattooed hand\nand his ringed fingers.</p><p>\u201c3.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019m sorry,\u201d Harry said his voice was almost like a whisper against\nthe loud counting.</p><p>\u201c2.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d Y/N replied looking up. Harry, he was almost towering\nover her. It was dark, no doubt but even in it Y/N could make the outlines of\nhis face and Y/N could see the light glinting almost like a star in his eyes.</p><p>\u201c1.\u201d</p><p>Y/N didn\u2019t know what happened -maybe it was the Champaign in her system- but\nit felt as if her hand made its way up to Harry\u2019s cheek on it\u2019s own and pressed\nitself lightly against him. Y/N was about to kiss him but the lights came back\non as she returned to her senses and hurriedly took her hand away from him.</p><p>\u201cHappy New Year!\u201d Everyone yelled.</p><p>\u201cHappy New Year,\u201d Harry whispered to Y/N as a smirk played on his\nlips.</p><p>Y/N didn\u2019t reply she was just so embarrassed, she couldn\u2019t even look at him even\nfor a brief second. Harry however hadn\u2019t tore his gaze from her. Even when he\nwas greeting people for new year just like Y/N was, he had his gaze fixed on\nher, making Y/N even more nervous.</p><p>For the next ten minutes it was nothing but loud chattering as they could\nsee the fireworks from the huge window that covered one entire wall of the\nroom.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ll head home,\u201d Y/N didn\u2019t want to talk to Harry at all\n-she was too embarrassed for that- but she was about to leave and leaving\nwithout a good bye when he was standing next to her just seemed rude.</p><p>\u201cWhy? Party just started,\u201d Harry replied.</p><p>Y/N didn\u2019t know why she wanted to leave, or maybe she did. Y/N just wanted\nget away from him and just tell herself how stupid she acted while eating ice\ncream and re-watching some show on Netflix.</p><p>He was older, why he\u2019d want to be with a teenager, such as herself. Why\nwould Y/N even think of making a move when it was clearly not possible for\nthem.</p><p>Y/ N just wanted to go home.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not feeling like partying right now.\u201d</p><p>Harry chuckled. \u201cI\u2019ll drop you off then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need,\u201d Y/N quickly said shaking her head. She wanted\nto get away from him, she obviously didn\u2019t want be alone with him in a car for\nalmost an hour. But there was a part of her which was excited and which just\nwanted to be alone with him and spend time with him.</p><p>\u201cOh, c'mon, You had too many drinks, you don\u2019t want to spend the first\nday of new year in jail, now do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, you had drinks yourself,\u201d Y/N tried to reason.</p><p>\u201cOne glass can drive,\u201d stated as he tugged on Y/N\u2019s arm to so\nshe\u2019d move.</p><p>\u201cBu-\u201d Y/N tried to protest but Harry cut her.</p><p>\u201cNo buts,\u201d Harry said pulling her.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d Y/N said giving in. It was probably that part of her which\njust wanted to be with him, that made her give in so easily.</p><p>*</p><p>The whole car ride was light hearted. Harry made small talks - asking her\nabout her family, congratulating her on her new film, cracking a joke every now\nand then as different songs played softly from the radio.</p><p>Y/N felt comfortable. Even though she had butterflies in her stomach and her\nheart was still racing, she wasn\u2019t nervous anymore. Y/N almost felt she knew\nhim her whole life, even though she knew it was their first time having a\ndecent conversation. But, Harry, he made her feel home, somehow.</p><p><i>Guess I\u2019ll just stumble on home to my cats </i></p><p><i>Alone, unless you wanna come along</i></p><p>\u201cGonna sleep now?\u201d Harry asked as he parked his car in Y/N\u2019s front\nlawn.</p><p>\u201cUm no, probably gonna cuddle my cats and watch TV,\u201d Y/N paused\nbefore she said timidly. \u201cUnless you wanna come along.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Harry\u2019s face broke into a huge grin. It was as if he was\nalmost waiting for Y/N to say those words.</p><p>Harry turned off his car\u2019s ignition before Y/N guided him to her house. The\nrest of the night they watched &lsquo;Legally Blonde\u2019 while snuggling each other with\nfive of Y/N\u2019s cats and eventually falling asleep on each other by morning.</p><p><i>That night was the night when Y/N found her love.</i></p>",

That was the third\ntime that night she was caught staring. But, that didn\u2019t make her get used to\nhis soft yet stern; light yet steely gaze, nor did it make her look away from\nhim. Y/N waved with confidence, a smile fixed on her face but her knees- they\nwere going weak and her heart- it was beating thousand miles a minute.</p><p>Harry waved back just like he did last two times before going back to his\nconversation. Even from this far Y/N could tell he was confused and even from\nthis far she sensed the little excitement and happiness, he exerted after that.</p><p>\u201cYou like him.\u201d</p><p>A sudden voice snapped Y/N out of her thoughts. Y/N looked on her side. It\nwas Mia, her best friend and her colleague. However, she wasn\u2019t looking at her,\nshe was looking at the man Y/N was looking at</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Y/N asked trying to act confused.</p><p>\u201cHarry, you\u2019ve been looking at him non-stop from the past hour,\u201d\nshe said as she turned around leaning her front on the bar counter, Y/N\nfollowed suit.</p><p><i>You should take it as a compliment </i></p><p><i>That I got drunk and made fun of the way you talk</i></p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like him! I just think he talks in a funny way,\u201d Y/N\nreplied as she put a hand on her upper abdomen and moved her other hand in the\nair in attempt of copying him.</p><p>\u201cWhatever you say, but remember he\u2019s older than you, a lot older than\nyou\u201d Mia said in a sing song voice before walking away to her boyfriend\nwho was waving at her.</p><p>\u201cI talk like that?\u201d A very familiar yet foreign voice spoke from\nbehind, startling Y/N.</p><p>\u201cOh, jeez, you scared me,\u201d Y/N said putting a hand on her chest\nbut looking away from him, nonetheless. Seeing him from far made her heart beat\nlike it\u2019s in a marathon and having him just few inches away from her, she felt\nher heart was going to beat out of her chest as her palms got sweaty, her mind\nfuzzy while she felt her face heat up.</p><p><i>You\u2019re so gorgeous I can\u2019t say anything to your face </i></p><p><i>\u2018Cause look at your face</i></p><p>\u201cI talk like that?\u201d Harry said again before ordering a drink for\nhimself.</p><p>\u201cUm, yeah uh - a little,\u201d Y/N stuttered looking at Harry for a\nbrief second and looked down again. \u201cBut, I didn\u2019t mean it that way, I was\njust I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p><i>You should think about the consequence </i></p><p><i>Of your magnetic field being a little too strong</i></p><p>Y/N looked up again. He was looking at her with an amused look on his face\nas his eyes sparkled under the dim light. Y/N, however she just wanted to run\naway from him and get into the safety of her house or the bathroom of the house\nshe was in currently, but she couldn\u2019t. She felt like he was pulling her like a\nmagnet and staying even two inches away from him was hard for her.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry people tell me that all the time,\u201d Harry hadn\u2019t torn\nhis gaze away from her at all. And Y/N could tell he was enjoying seeing Y/N\ngetting all worked up under his gaze.</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t change it though,\u201d Y/N looked away taking a sip\nfrom her wine. \u201cI think it\u2019s adorable.\u201d</p><p>Her head snapped at Harry\u2019s direction. Her eyes went wide as she clasped her\nhand on her mouth realizing what she just said making Harry chuckle out loud.\n\u201cOh God, I didn\u2019t mean it like that. I shouldn\u2019t have said that.\u201d</p><p><i>He was her senior - by age, by career -was she fucking stupid!</i></p><p>\u201cThen what you meant?\u201d Harry laughed.</p><p><i>Forest Green eyes looking in mine </i></p><p><i>I feel like I might sink and drown and die</i></p><p>\u201cUh, I, um-\u201d Harry raised his eyebrows at Y/N making her quickly\nlook away again. Y/N could never maintain an eye contact with him more than two\nminutes; looking at his green orbs just made her feel she would sink, drown and\neventually die in them.</p><p><i>And you should think about the consequence </i></p><p><i>Of you touching my hand in a darkened room</i></p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Y/N quickly replied as she played with the glass\nin her hand filled with Champaign. Harry hummed next to her. Before they could\nsay anything else and before Y/N could get any more nervous the lights went out\nas the countdown started for the new year.</p><p>\u201c10.\u201d</p><p>\u201c9.\u201d</p><p>\u201c8.\u201d</p><p>\u201c7.\u201d</p><p>\u201c6.\u201d</p><p>\u201c5.\u201d</p><p>Electricity ran through Y/N\u2019s vein as she felt a hand brush hers ever so\nlightly.</p><p>\u201c4.\u201d</p><p>Y/N looked down, even in the dark Y/N could make out Harry\u2019s tattooed hand\nand his ringed fingers.</p><p>\u201c3.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019m sorry,\u201d Harry said his voice was almost like a whisper against\nthe loud counting.</p><p>\u201c2.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d Y/N replied looking up. Harry, he was almost towering\nover her. It was dark, no doubt but even in it Y/N could make the outlines of\nhis face and Y/N could see the light glinting almost like a star in his eyes.</p><p>\u201c1.\u201d</p><p>Y/N didn\u2019t know what happened -maybe it was the Champaign in her system- but\nit felt as if her hand made its way up to Harry\u2019s cheek on it\u2019s own and pressed\nitself lightly against him. Y/N was about to kiss him but the lights came back\non as she returned to her senses and hurriedly took her hand away from him.</p><p>\u201cHappy New Year!\u201d Everyone yelled.</p><p>\u201cHappy New Year,\u201d Harry whispered to Y/N as a smirk played on his\nlips.</p><p>Y/N didn\u2019t reply she was just so embarrassed, she couldn\u2019t even look at him even\nfor a brief second. Harry however hadn\u2019t tore his gaze from her. Even when he\nwas greeting people for new year just like Y/N was, he had his gaze fixed on\nher, making Y/N even more nervous.</p><p>For the next ten minutes it was nothing but loud chattering as they could\nsee the fireworks from the huge window that covered one entire wall of the\nroom.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ll head home,\u201d Y/N didn\u2019t want to talk to Harry at all\n-she was too embarrassed for that- but she was about to leave and leaving\nwithout a good bye when he was standing next to her just seemed rude.</p><p>\u201cWhy? Party just started,\u201d Harry replied.</p><p>Y/N didn\u2019t know why she wanted to leave, or maybe she did. Y/N just wanted\nget away from him and just tell herself how stupid she acted while eating ice\ncream and re-watching some show on Netflix.</p><p>He was older, why he\u2019d want to be with a teenager, such as herself. Why\nwould Y/N even think of making a move when it was clearly not possible for\nthem.</p><p>Y/ N just wanted to go home.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not feeling like partying right now.\u201d</p><p>Harry chuckled. \u201cI\u2019ll drop you off then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need,\u201d Y/N quickly said shaking her head. She wanted\nto get away from him, she obviously didn\u2019t want be alone with him in a car for\nalmost an hour. But there was a part of her which was excited and which just\nwanted to be alone with him and spend time with him.</p><p>\u201cOh, c'mon, You had too many drinks, you don\u2019t want to spend the first\nday of new year in jail, now do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, you had drinks yourself,\u201d Y/N tried to reason.</p><p>\u201cOne glass can drive,\u201d stated as he tugged on Y/N\u2019s arm to so\nshe\u2019d move.</p><p>\u201cBu-\u201d Y/N tried to protest but Harry cut her.</p><p>\u201cNo buts,\u201d Harry said pulling her.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d Y/N said giving in. It was probably that part of her which\njust wanted to be with him, that made her give in so easily.</p><p>*</p><p>The whole car ride was light hearted. Harry made small talks - asking her\nabout her family, congratulating her on her new film, cracking a joke every now\nand then as different songs played softly from the radio.</p><p>Y/N felt comfortable. Even though she had butterflies in her stomach and her\nheart was still racing, she wasn\u2019t nervous anymore. Y/N almost felt she knew\nhim her whole life, even though she knew it was their first time having a\ndecent conversation. But, Harry, he made her feel home, somehow.</p><p><i>Guess I\u2019ll just stumble on home to my cats </i></p><p><i>Alone, unless you wanna come along</i></p><p>\u201cGonna sleep now?\u201d Harry asked as he parked his car in Y/N\u2019s front\nlawn.</p><p>\u201cUm no, probably gonna cuddle my cats and watch TV,\u201d Y/N paused\nbefore she said timidly. \u201cUnless you wanna come along.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Harry\u2019s face broke into a huge grin. It was as if he was\nalmost waiting for Y/N to say those words.</p><p>Harry turned off his car\u2019s ignition before Y/N guided him to her house. The\nrest of the night they watched \u2018Legally Blonde\u2019 while snuggling each other with\nfive of Y/N\u2019s cats and eventually falling asleep on each other by morning.</p><p><i>That night was the night when Y/N found her love.</i></p>",

The\nroom was decorated with elegant jewelleries and ornaments. People were dancing\nand drinking with their friends and their partners.

                "content": "<p><i>-the one inspired from Gorgeous</i></p><p><a href=\"https://itslikeipayforit.tumblr.com/post/171056296870/master-list\"><b>Master List</b></a></p><p><b>Before You Read: Y/N is famous herself, huge age difference (I didn&rsquo;t\nmention their age so you can pretend Y/N&rsquo;s age whatever but she&rsquo;s legal), I\nchanged the lyric from Ocean blue eyes to forest green eye - just so it makes\nsense!</b></p><p><b><i>A/N: I have so many request rn but I decided to write something that\npopped in my mind few days ago. But, I promise I&rsquo;ll get back to each and\neveryone who sent in requests and promise I&rsquo;m not ignoring you guys! Plus as it\nis inspired by Taylor Swifts&rsquo;s Gorgeous, I&rsquo;d recommend you to listen to it\nwhile reading it.</i></b></p><p>The air was filled with the smell of campaign and expensive fragrance. The\nroom was decorated with elegant jewelleries and ornaments. People were dancing\nand drinking with their friends and their partners. But, Y/N stood there alone,\nwith her own glass of Champaign, wearing an expensive short dress of her own;\nilluminated under the chandelier above her. Her gaze was fixed at a particular\nman standing at the far corner of the room talking to few of his friends.</p><p>Y/N didn&rsquo;t know how long she was standing there, looking at him. However,\nthe time she spotted him - she wasn&rsquo;t tipsy and her elbows and shoulder didn&rsquo;t\nhurt for leaning on the bar counter for so long.</p><p>Harry, he was so gorgeous. His forest green eyes, his sizzled cheek bones,\nhis defined jaw, his fluffy hair - he was just so gorgeous.</p><p>Suddenly, he looked on his left and his eyes fell on her. That was the third\ntime that night she was caught staring. But, that didn&rsquo;t make her get used to\nhis soft yet stern; light yet steely gaze, nor did it make her look away from\nhim. Y/N waved with confidence, a smile fixed on her face but her knees- they\nwere going weak and her heart- it was beating thousand miles a minute.</p><p>Harry waved back just like he did last two times before going back to his\nconversation. Even from this far Y/N could tell he was confused and even from\nthis far she sensed the little excitement and happiness, he exerted after that.</p><p>&ldquo;You like him.&rdquo;</p><p>A sudden voice snapped Y/N out of her thoughts. Y/N looked on her side. It\nwas Mia, her best friend and her colleague. However, she wasn&rsquo;t looking at her,\nshe was looking at the man Y/N was looking at</p><p>&ldquo;Huh?&rdquo; Y/N asked trying to act confused.</p><p>&ldquo;Harry, you&rsquo;ve been looking at him non-stop from the past hour,&rdquo;\nshe said as she turned around leaning her front on the bar counter, Y/N\nfollowed suit.</p><p><i>You should take it as a compliment </i></p><p><i>That I got drunk and made fun of the way you talk</i></p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like him! I just think he talks in a funny way,&rdquo; Y/N\nreplied as she put a hand on her upper abdomen and moved her other hand in the\nair in attempt of copying him.</p><p>&ldquo;Whatever you say, but remember he&rsquo;s older than you, a lot older than\nyou&rdquo; Mia said in a sing song voice before walking away to her boyfriend\nwho was waving at her.</p><p>&ldquo;I talk like that?&rdquo; A very familiar yet foreign voice spoke from\nbehind, startling Y/N.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, jeez, you scared me,&rdquo; Y/N said putting a hand on her chest\nbut looking away from him, nonetheless. Seeing him from far made her heart beat\nlike it&rsquo;s in a marathon and having him just few inches away from her, she felt\nher heart was going to beat out of her chest as her palms got sweaty, her mind\nfuzzy while she felt her face heat up.</p><p><i>You&rsquo;re so gorgeous I can&rsquo;t say anything to your face </i></p><p><i>&lsquo;Cause look at your face</i></p><p>&ldquo;I talk like that?&rdquo; Harry said again before ordering a drink for\nhimself.</p><p>&ldquo;Um, yeah uh - a little,&rdquo; Y/N stuttered looking at Harry for a\nbrief second and looked down again. &ldquo;But, I didn&rsquo;t mean it that way, I was\njust I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p><p><i>You should think about the consequence </i></p><p><i>Of your magnetic field being a little too strong</i></p><p>Y/N looked up again. He was looking at her with an amused look on his face\nas his eyes sparkled under the dim light. Y/N, however she just wanted to run\naway from him and get into the safety of her house or the bathroom of the house\nshe was in currently, but she couldn&rsquo;t. She felt like he was pulling her like a\nmagnet and staying even two inches away from him was hard for her.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry people tell me that all the time,&rdquo; Harry hadn&rsquo;t torn\nhis gaze away from her at all. And Y/N could tell he was enjoying seeing Y/N\ngetting all worked up under his gaze.</p><p>&ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t change it though,&rdquo; Y/N looked away taking a sip\nfrom her wine. &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s adorable.&rdquo;</p><p>Her head snapped at Harry&rsquo;s direction. Her eyes went wide as she clasped her\nhand on her mouth realizing what she just said making Harry chuckle out loud.\n&ldquo;Oh God, I didn&rsquo;t mean it like that. I shouldn&rsquo;t have said that.&rdquo;</p><p><i>He was her senior - by age, by career -was she fucking stupid!</i></p><p>&ldquo;Then what you meant?&rdquo; Harry laughed.</p><p><i>Forest Green eyes looking in mine </i></p><p><i>I feel like I might sink and drown and die</i></p><p>&ldquo;Uh, I, um-&rdquo; Harry raised his eyebrows at Y/N making her quickly\nlook away again. Y/N could never maintain an eye contact with him more than two\nminutes; looking at his green orbs just made her feel she would sink, drown and\neventually die in them.</p><p><i>And you should think about the consequence </i></p><p><i>Of you touching my hand in a darkened room</i></p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Y/N quickly replied as she played with the glass\nin her hand filled with Champaign. Harry hummed next to her. Before they could\nsay anything else and before Y/N could get any more nervous the lights went out\nas the countdown started for the new year.</p><p>&ldquo;10.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;9.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;8.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;7.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;6.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;5.&rdquo;</p><p>Electricity ran through Y/N&rsquo;s vein as she felt a hand brush hers ever so\nlightly.</p><p>&ldquo;4.&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N looked down, even in the dark Y/N could make out Harry&rsquo;s tattooed hand\nand his ringed fingers.</p><p>&ldquo;3.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; Harry said his voice was almost like a whisper against\nthe loud counting.</p><p>&ldquo;2.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine,&rdquo; Y/N replied looking up. Harry, he was almost towering\nover her. It was dark, no doubt but even in it Y/N could make the outlines of\nhis face and Y/N could see the light glinting almost like a star in his eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;1.&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N didn&rsquo;t know what happened -maybe it was the Champaign in her system- but\nit felt as if her hand made its way up to Harry&rsquo;s cheek on it&rsquo;s own and pressed\nitself lightly against him. Y/N was about to kiss him but the lights came back\non as she returned to her senses and hurriedly took her hand away from him.</p><p>&ldquo;Happy New Year!&rdquo; Everyone yelled.</p><p>&ldquo;Happy New Year,&rdquo; Harry whispered to Y/N as a smirk played on his\nlips.</p><p>Y/N didn&rsquo;t reply she was just so embarrassed, she couldn&rsquo;t even look at him even\nfor a brief second. Harry however hadn&rsquo;t tore his gaze from her. Even when he\nwas greeting people for new year just like Y/N was, he had his gaze fixed on\nher, making Y/N even more nervous.</p><p>For the next ten minutes it was nothing but loud chattering as they could\nsee the fireworks from the huge window that covered one entire wall of the\nroom.</p><p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll head home,&rdquo; Y/N didn&rsquo;t want to talk to Harry at all\n-she was too embarrassed for that- but she was about to leave and leaving\nwithout a good bye when he was standing next to her just seemed rude.</p><p>&ldquo;Why? Party just started,&rdquo; Harry replied.</p><p>Y/N didn&rsquo;t know why she wanted to leave, or maybe she did. Y/N just wanted\nget away from him and just tell herself how stupid she acted while eating ice\ncream and re-watching some show on Netflix.</p><p>He was older, why he&rsquo;d want to be with a teenager, such as herself. Why\nwould Y/N even think of making a move when it was clearly not possible for\nthem.</p><p>Y/ N just wanted to go home.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not feeling like partying right now.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry chuckled. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll drop you off then.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no need,&rdquo; Y/N quickly said shaking her head. She wanted\nto get away from him, she obviously didn&rsquo;t want be alone with him in a car for\nalmost an hour. But there was a part of her which was excited and which just\nwanted to be alone with him and spend time with him.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, c'mon, You had too many drinks, you don&rsquo;t want to spend the first\nday of new year in jail, now do you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Uh, you had drinks yourself,&rdquo; Y/N tried to reason.</p><p>&ldquo;One glass can drive,&rdquo; stated as he tugged on Y/N&rsquo;s arm to so\nshe&rsquo;d move.</p><p>&ldquo;Bu-&rdquo; Y/N tried to protest but Harry cut her.</p><p>&ldquo;No buts,&rdquo; Harry said pulling her.</p><p>&ldquo;Fine,&rdquo; Y/N said giving in. It was probably that part of her which\njust wanted to be with him, that made her give in so easily.</p><p>*</p><p>The whole car ride was light hearted. Harry made small talks - asking her\nabout her family, congratulating her on her new film, cracking a joke every now\nand then as different songs played softly from the radio.</p><p>Y/N felt comfortable. Even though she had butterflies in her stomach and her\nheart was still racing, she wasn&rsquo;t nervous anymore. Y/N almost felt she knew\nhim her whole life, even though she knew it was their first time having a\ndecent conversation. But, Harry, he made her feel home, somehow.</p><p><i>Guess I&rsquo;ll just stumble on home to my cats </i></p><p><i>Alone, unless you wanna come along</i></p><p>&ldquo;Gonna sleep now?&rdquo; Harry asked as he parked his car in Y/N&rsquo;s front\nlawn.</p><p>&ldquo;Um no, probably gonna cuddle my cats and watch TV,&rdquo; Y/N paused\nbefore she said timidly. &ldquo;Unless you wanna come along.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; Harry&rsquo;s face broke into a huge grin. It was as if he was\nalmost waiting for Y/N to say those words.</p><p>Harry turned off his car&rsquo;s ignition before Y/N guided him to her house. The\nrest of the night they watched &lsquo;Legally Blonde&rsquo; while snuggling each other with\nfive of Y/N&rsquo;s cats and eventually falling asleep on each other by morning.</p><p><i>That night was the night when Y/N found her love.</i></p>",
