The only thing redeeming him here is that he is OK with her having other friends.</p><p>Exandria-specifically, aren\u2019t the gods supposed to have been sealed away behind the Divine Gate so that they cannot interfere directly with the Prime Material? You know, like Vox Machina spent a good chunk of their last story arc making sure would happen to Vecna?</p><p>I don\u2019t doubt that the Traveler is a god. His worship is banned as we saw when items pertaining to him were mixed up in that cache of banned holy symbols the Mighty Nein found in the Merrow cave. I just doubt that the entity that\u2019s been speaking to Jester is that god.</p><p>And now he mentioned sending her to a whole group of his cultists.
