The Triwizard Tournament was occurring this year, which explained the foreign students and the upset feeling in his gut.</p><p>The brunette looked at the table because he didn\u2019t want to deal with this currently. He had researched the tournament when informed it would be occurring this year, and found it stupid and dangerous. Who the hell put kids into a tournament that could potentially kill them?</p><!-- more --><p>\u201cDrop the gloomy expression, Lupin, there are charming girls around,\u201d Sirius whispered as he nudged at him to make the brunette look up at him with an annoyed expression.</p><p>\u201cOf course all you\u2019re thinking about are the girls surrounding us,\u201d he said before he put his attention back to the wooden table. His fingers traced over the patterns in the wood before he looked at the headmaster.</p><p>\u201cOur sisters from Beauxbatons Academy and brothers from Drumstrang Institute have joined us this year to experience the Tri Wizard Tournament, but you must be 15 years old to enter. This tournament is not for the faint of heart and the eternal glory will be worth everything you\u2019ve ever dreamed of,\u201d Dumbledore explained before he showed the students the Goblet of Fire.</p><p>\u201cWe should all enter,\u201d James said and Remus looked over at the boy across the table from him to see the black haired boy with an excited expression. Remus responded with an annoyed look at his friends and a sigh.</p><p>\u201cI most definitely will not and neither should any of you. It\u2019s dangerous and we could die,\u201d Remus said and Sirius rolled his eyes at the brunette, which almost made Remus strangle him.</p><p>\u201cCome on, so many people will be entering and we\u2019ll most definitely not be chosen. It\u2019ll make Lily think I\u2019m brave. Or maybe one of those hot French girls,\u201d James said with a wink and Remus shook his head and then looked back to Dumbledore to ignore the conversation. He was tired of hearing his friends constantly talk about the girls surrounding them at all times.</p><p>The brunette didn\u2019t care if the chances were slim, because he wouldn\u2019t be taking any. At 15 years old, he didn\u2019t think he was ready to compete to the death (sure, it wasn\u2019t to the death, but it would be his luck to die). He chuckled to himself, because for a suicidal kid; he was picky on how he wanted to die.</p><p>Once again, Sirius nudged at Remus and the brunette blinked his eyes and looked at the other. He had zoned out, something he did a lot of now.</p><p>\u201cPeter had decided to not do it, but James and I are going to. We\u2019re thinking of waiting until it\u2019s the most crowded to do it or maybe just do it on Saturday,\u201d Sirius said and Remus rolled his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad Peter listens to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re welcome to join us by either just coming and watching or putting your name in,\u201d Sirius said and Remus sighed before nodding to joining. He wouldn\u2019t be joining the competition, but just joining them as an audience member to watch them put their names into the goblet. Maybe he could talk sense into them before they decided to do so.</p><p>\u201cI really hope neither of you get chosen,\u201d Remus said and Sirius chuckled before the two noticed food had filled the table. Talk of the tournament had ended the moment the four started to eat, and Remus was grateful because of it.</p><hr><p>\u201cListen, do you know how many Hogwarts\u2019 students are going to enter this thing? A shit ton, so you need to realize how we\u2019ll most likely not be chosen,\u201d James explained once again to Remus as the four boys sat in the dormitory.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not based off chances though, it\u2019s based off who it thinks is worthy and how far a person is will to go to win. What if it thinks you\u2019re worthy? What if it thinks you actually want to be chosen?\u201d Remus asked and James groaned at the questions.</p><p>\u201cDo you really think a magical goblet will think Sirius and I are worthy enough? No offense, Sirius,\u201d James said and the other black hair boy rolled his eyes at the comment. He wasn\u2019t hurt by it, but it was annoying to be spoken about as if he wasn\u2019t there.</p><p>\u201cSay it picks one of us for some reason, what\u2019s the harm in competing? There\u2019s been one death in the entire span of it, so it seems pretty safe,\u201d Sirius said and Remus gritted his teeth at the statement. Of course Sirius would try to justify it.</p><p>\u201cJust because someone survived from jumping off a bridge doesn\u2019t mean you should do it,\u201d Remus said and Sirius looked at him confused.</p><p>\u201cSomeone jumped off a bridge?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow are you so fucking stupid sometimes?\u201d Remus asked as he pinched the bridge of his nose and then gestured with his hands as he spoke. \u201cIt\u2019s a figure of speech, do you know what that is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I do, but I thought a task had been to jump off a bridge once,\u201d Sirius said and Remus shut his eyes and took another deep breath in.</p><p>\u201cI was trying to say that just because people have survived in the past doesn\u2019t mean that everyone always will. The tasks are fucking dangerous. Do you not remember Dumbledore saying that this isn\u2019t for the faint of heart?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think either of us will be chosen and there\u2019s no harm in entering. If you could get Lily to come, then maybe she\u2019ll think I\u2019m super cool and date me,\u201d James said and Remus shook his head.</p><p>\u201cNot rewarding this stupid idea,\u201d the brunette said and then Peter spoke up.</p><p>\u201cHow are you guys certain it won\u2019t pick you?\u201d Peter asked and Remus pointed at the other in agreement, the smug look on his face pissed Sirius off slightly.</p><p>\u201cIt most likely doesn\u2019t pick the youngest contestants, because obviously we\u2019re not the best just yet. Also neither of us want to really be in the competition, just have the attention that comes with entering,\u201d James said as if it was clear as day.</p><p>\u201cBut what if it does pick you, James? What if Lily just thinks you\u2019re stupid for entering and getting chosen?\u201d Peter asked and the black haired boy rubbed his eyes before looking at him.</p><p>\u201cIf I\u2019m a champion, then maybe some cute French girl and I can be a thing,\u201d James said and Remus laughed at that. It wasn\u2019t that he doubted his friend being capable of doing it, but it was the fact his friend wouldn\u2019t let go of Lily Evans no matter what happened.</p><p>\u201cAll of this is still a bad idea according to me. I\u2019m just worried you guys will actually get chosen, and I don\u2019t want anything bad happening to you,\u201d Remus said and Peter nodded in agreement.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Moony. I promise neither of us will be chosen. Let\u2019s just go to sleep now, okay?\u201d Sirius asked because he was tired of the arguing. It hurt his head and made him upset and uncertain on whether or not he should do it.</p><p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d Remus huffed as he got up to go to bathroom to brush his teeth. James stared at the door and then looked over at Sirius.</p><p>\u201cWhy is he acting like this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe because he\u2019s worried about you two,\u201d Peter suggested and the glare from James made the mousy boy stop talking.</p><p>\u201cCan we just stop talking about it now? Obviously it\u2019s going to be half the group against the other half in this situation,\u201d Sirius said and James sighed. It was obvious he wanted all of them to enter, but there was no amount of convincing that would make Remus or Peter join in on their plan.</p><p>When Remus returned to the room, he looked over at Sirius with a look the long haired boy couldn\u2019t read. The brunette got in bed, pulled the curtains to cover him completely, which wasn\u2019t out of the ordinary, but he never said goodnight to any of them.</p><p>Remus was upset and Sirius knew it was mainly with him for agreeing to James\u2019s plan. The problem was that even if Sirius didn\u2019t want to enter his name, he couldn\u2019t back out. He didn\u2019t want James to feel alone or see him as scared, but he didn\u2019t want to say that aloud; especially to Remus.</p><hr><p>\u201cAre you sure about this?\u201d Remus asked and Sirius chuckled at the brunette. Of course he\u2019d ask the question as they were walking to the Great Hall in order to enter.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re sure, just stop asking that,\u201d James responded and Remus sighed as the three continued to walk.</p><p>Sirius wasn\u2019t sure if he wanted to do this, but he didn\u2019t want James to do it alone. The thought of entering wasn\u2019t terrifying, but the thought of becoming a champion sure was. He shook his head and tried to get to get the thoughts Remus had put in there out.</p><p>\u201cI really don\u2019t think this is a good idea,\u201d Remus stated once they entered the room and Sirius laughed at that. He wanted to agree with the brunette, but he knew he couldn\u2019t and wouldn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cYou never think I have good ideas,\u201d James responded as he walked up to the cup and Remus watched as he put his name in.</p><p>\u201cWell, quite frankly, you never do have any good ideas. Typically they\u2019re not great, but this one is actually fairly bad,\u201d the brunette boy told his black haired friend only to get a snort in return. \u201cSirius, it\u2019s not too late to not do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHonestly, it kind of is and maybe this will help me get laid,\u201d Sirius said before throwing his name in the fire and multiple of the foreign girls were watching him from afar. He knew they hadn\u2019t heard what he had said because their expression didn\u2019t hold a disgusted look.</p><p>Remus had clenched fists by his side and growled slightly at the boy. The way he acted made Sirius and James take a step back from the temperamental boy.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re telling me that you\u2019ll risk your life to get fucking laid? Your logic of how too many people entering and it won\u2019t pick you shows how big of dumbasses you two are!\u201d Remus yelled and Sirius tried to contain a cool demeanor instead of a frightened one.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you need to get laid, Remy,\u201d he said and Remus shoved at the taller boy for using the nickname he hated. Sirius didn\u2019t know why he had used the name, especially in a time like this, but he was shoved because of it.</p><p>James quickly stepped in between the two to try to prevent a fight from breaking out. He knew Sirius wouldn\u2019t fight back when the other was like this, but James decided to take precautions.</p><p>\u201cHey, Remus, let\u2019s calm down,\u201d James said as he slowly edged his way up to the brunette. Remus may have been two inches shorter, but in this moment it seemed like he towered over James.</p><p>He shoved James away from him, into the floor, and strutted out of the Great Hall, anger seethed from him and everyone could tell. Sirius quickly helped up the other black haired boy and sighed in the direction of where Remus had left.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s near full moon,\u201d Sirius defended and James scoffed at the comment, but Sirius knew the other knew the reason was a valid one. Remus couldn\u2019t help how his moods and anger fluctuated, but Sirius knew this wasn\u2019t actually just a result from the brunette being a werewolf.</p><p>\u201cDo you think he\u2019s actually mad at us? Like to the point where he may not talk to us,\u201d James asked and Sirius didn\u2019t know the answer and didn\u2019t want to think about that. He didn\u2019t want to think about Remus shutting them out like he had done second year after he confessed he was a werewolf.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s hope not, because we\u2019re screwed without his brain. Sure, it was uncalled for, but we typically don\u2019t have great ideas,\u201d Sirius admitted and James nodded in agreement.</p><p>The two walked out of the Great Hall and saw Peter fidgeting as he walked towards them. He appeared to be fidgeting more than normal, which worried Sirius slightly.</p><p>\u201cHey, Peter, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d James asked and the nervous boy let out a deep breath.</p><p>\u201cRemus told me to tell you two that he won\u2019t be talking to either of you for a couple days or until he cools off. He also said don\u2019t talk to him or he\u2019ll hex you,\u201d Peter said slightly rushed and the two black haired boys stared at him in disbelief.</p><p>\u201cJust because we put our names in the goblet?\u201d Sirius asked and Peter shook his head. Of course there would be more so Remus could feel justified in his actions.</p><p>\u201cHe thinks you two don\u2019t care about him or his opinion,\u201d Peter said and James scoffed at the statement only to realize the brunette was being honest.</p><p>\u201cAre you bloody kidding me? We do one thing and he acts like a child!\u201d James yelled and Sirius just remained quiet. Usually he\u2019d be the one yelling, but he understood why Remus felt that way. The werewolf boy had asked them to not do it repeatedly, but they ignored him and kept telling him how it would be okay.</p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t listen to him about something that could put us in harm\u2019s way, which scares him,\u201d Sirius said and James stopped yelling once the other spoke. \u201cHe\u2019s scared we\u2019ll be picked and then die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe chances of that are slim though, doesn\u2019t he realize that? I thought this out, but he doesn\u2019t care about that,\u201d James complained and Sirius sighed in response. He was upset along with James, but he also had listened to everything Remus had said.</p><p>Neither of them spoke to the brunette boy. James didn\u2019t speak to him because he was angry at him as well, but Sirius didn\u2019t speak to him because he wasn\u2019t in the mood to get hexed.</p><hr><p>At first, Sirius and James didn\u2019t think Remus would actually shut them out, but when he didn\u2019t come to support them during their Qudditch practices, sat away from them at meals, and ignored the assigned seating so he wasn\u2019t near them; the duo started to worry.</p><p>They had known he was upset, but didn\u2019t realize it was this to extent. Nearly a week had gone by when Sirius decided he\u2019d just talk to the brunette. It didn\u2019t matter to him if he got hexed as long as he got to speak to his best friend.</p><p>\u201cRemus, we need to talk,\u201d Sirius said as he sat across the table from the other in the common room. The scarred boy looked up from his homework and rolled his eyes.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said before he looked back down at his homework and ignored the black haired boy seated across from him.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you so pissed? We put our names in there, so what? It never meant we don\u2019t care about you or anything you say,\u201d Sirius said and Remus looked up at him his an annoyed expression. The black haired boy worried it would turn into an aggressive one soon, but he tried to remain calm.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I don\u2019t want my friends to die, my fucking bad,\u201d Remus snapped before he slammed his book shut and looked at the other with an enraged look. \u201cYou get pissed at me constantly because I do something you don\u2019t like, but the moment I get pissed; I\u2019m being unreasonable!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMate, it\u2019s just that we never fucking acted or said we didn\u2019t care about you. We invited you to come with us and you did. We invited you to join us in putting your name in and you didn\u2019t. We didn\u2019t pressure you into anything, but we wanted to do it,\u201d Sirius said and he tried to remain calm for his own sake. If he blew up, then Remus would blow up ten times worse.</p><p>Remus looked at him with an expressionless face and it terrified the other boy, but Sirius didn\u2019t let his fear show. The scarred face brunette sighed and licked his lips as he thought, something he did quite regularly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just scared,\u201d Remus whispered and Sirius nodded, because he was slightly scared too. He couldn\u2019t admit it aloud, but maybe in this moment the other would understand how scared he was too.</p><p>\u201cI promise it\u2019s going to be okay, neither James nor I are going to be picked. Just have some faith,\u201d Sirius said and the other gave him a soft smile, one that wasn\u2019t noticeable unless you knew him.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019m sorry for being a prick,\u201d Remus muttered and Sirius smiled at him before he got up and threw an arm around the other.</p><p>\u201cGood, now let\u2019s go tell James the good news.\u201d</p><hr><p>\u201cSee that girl over there?\u201d Sirius asked and Remus looked up from his book to see one of the French girls staring at him only to look away quickly.</p><p>\u201cYeah, what about her?\u201d Remus asked unamused and Sirius gave him an annoyed look.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s been checking you out all this time, but all you ever do is check out books,\u201d Sirius said and James laughed at the joke his friend had made.</p><p>It was only the three boys since Peter was in detention for cheating on a test. McGonagall was being rough this year and the other boy had been stupid to think he could\u2019ve gotten away with it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather learn about the world than learn about some girl I\u2019ll never see again after this year,\u201d the brunette said before he turned his attention back down to his book.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s called a one night stand, Moony,\u201d James said and Remus looked over at him, through Sirius.</p><p>\u201cI taught you what that word was, along with the majority of your vocabulary, so shut the hell up,\u201d he snapped and over the last couple weeks the brunette had only grown grumpier and more aggressive. No one knew why because he was still fairly closed off from his friends since the last fight had happened.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s staring again,\u201d Sirius commented, not paying attention to his friends squabbling. The other two were always bickering, so Sirius never paid attention to it unless there was actual yelling involved.</p><p>The girl caught the stare of Sirius and he could tell she felt embarrassed by being caught, but still turned her attention back over to the brunette next to him. Although Sirius wasn\u2019t listening, he could tell the brunette was still arguing with James and it gave him time to observe the other.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t that Sirius thought Remus was unattractive by any means, but it was weird for foreign girls to find the scarred face attractive when a lot of people at Hogwarts didn\u2019t. Maybe the scars made him attractive? Or maybe the freckles that were located upon his cheeks and nose were what drew others in?</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you looking at?\u201d Remus asked with a hit of the black haired boy\u2019s shoulder and Sirius blinked his eyes a couple time before he shrugged. Had he really been staring at Remus so intensely he got lost in his own thoughts?</p><p>\u201cI was just thinking, guess I looked over at you at the wrong time,\u201d Sirius lied because he wasn\u2019t going to admit how he had been analyzing the freckles scattered across the other\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cWhatever, just don\u2019t do it again? It was weird,\u201d Remus said before he opened his book and started to read once more. Sirius looked over to see James no longer next to him but across the room next to Lily Evans.</p><p>James had a way of looking at Lily, almost as if he wanted to know every detail about her appearance. Sirius watched as the smile on James face diminished when he was most likely rejected once more and then the smile reappeared when he probably said how he\u2019d never give up.</p><p>\u201cDo you think he\u2019s serious when he says he\u2019ll never give up?\u201d Remus asked and Sirius snorted.</p><p>\u201cObviously I\u2019m Sirius, he\u2019s James. To think you call us your best friend,\u201d Sirius joked for a second and then noticed the annoyed expression of Remus\u2019s face. \u201cI think he\u2019s never going to give up, because it\u2019s a promise when he says it.\u201d</p><p>Remus fell silent once more and Sirius watched James walk over to the two. He had a smile on his face, something he told Sirius was how he\u2019d never cry or frown in public after being rejected. He didn\u2019t want to seem weak for his feelings and Sirius understood that, but he wondered if it was because they both came from pureblood houses.</p><p>\u201cWe should get going, see if Pete is done with detention yet,\u201d James said and the other two followed his lead, only to end up in an empty boys\u2019 bathroom. \u201cWhy doesn\u2019t she want me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMate, I think it\u2019s more of a she doesn\u2019t want anyone kind of thing,\u201d Remus said, trying to provide comfort while Sirius slung an arm around his best friend\u2019s shoulders.</p><p>\u201cJamie, she\u2019ll realize soon enough, just give her time. You\u2019re a catch,\u201d Sirius said before messing up his already messy hair to get a huff out of the other.</p><p>\u201cHow many times do I have to tell you to not call me Jamie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you\u2019re being girly, sometimes we have to.\u201d</p><hr><p>Weeks had passed and it was finally the night of announcement of the champions. All day Remus had been worried about who would be the champions, but Sirius continued to tell him it would be okay. James repeated his theory of how they wouldn\u2019t be chosen, but his words still didn\u2019t soothe the worried brunette.</p><p>Peter kept trying to back Sirius and James up, but he was shut down with the bitterness known as Remus Lupin. It was obvious that until the champions were announced, he wouldn\u2019t be calm or collected about it.</p><p>The brunette fidgeted at the Gryffindor table; his legs bounced up and down and his hands strummed along the table. His fingers made an annoying drumming sound and Sirius placed his hand over the other to stop the noise. The touch made the other jump and Sirius chuckled at Remus\u2019s nerves.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be okay, calm down. There\u2019s no way neither James nor I will be picked, remember that? We\u2019ve been over this repeatedly, remember?\u201d Sirius asked and Remus nodded. It didn\u2019t matter if he remembered or how many times they went over it, he was still scared.</p><p>\u201cI\u2013I know, but I have the right to be scared, okay? I have the right to worry my friends would be chosen and fucking die?\u201d Remus whispered over at him, worried others would hear them fight.</p><p>\u201cAlright, students, today we will find out our champions per school. Don\u2019t forget how big of an honor this and I hope you can support and congratulate them,\u201d Dumbledore began and the two boys fell silent in order to listen to what the man had to say.</p><p>Remus grabbed Sirius\u2019s hand under the table. His grip was tight and Sirius could feel all the fear in the other due to the racing heartbeat he felt. He wondered if maybe it was his own from being worried that he may be chosen, but he continued to remember the words James said about his reasoning of not being chosen.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll begin with Beauxbatons Academy,\u201d Dumbledore announced and a slip of paper came out and landed in the man\u2019s hand. He took a moment to read it before he looked back out at the students. \u201cLucinda Beaumont.\u201d</p><p>The girls from the academy started to clap, as well as the boys, for the brunette girl who stood up. Remus watched her walk down the aisles and saw the smile carved on her face. She was serious about this and Remus felt like if his friends weren\u2019t, then they shouldn\u2019t have entered, because this was for those who knew what they wanted. He looked over at Sirius and a shaky breath left his lips because what if Sirius was committed to this?</p><p>\u201cFrom Drumstrang Institute, we have Charles Elliot,\u201d Dumbledore announced and Remus had missed the name coming out from the Goblet due to his thoughts. He clutched Sirius\u2019s hand tighter since Hogwarts would be next.</p><p>\u201cFinally, Hogwarts,\u201d Dumbledore said and the paper exploded from the Goblet, something he hadn\u2019t done the last two times. Remus wasn\u2019t breathing and Lily tried to get him to breathe in the silence of Dumbledore reading the name. \u201cSirius Black.\u201d</p><p>Remus blinked and Sirius looked like he was in shock, because this hadn\u2019t been the plan. No one had thought he\u2019d actually be selected and Remus\u2019s hand went limp, no longer gripping to the other.</p><p>Sirius slowly stood up and people were clapping and cheering for him except Peter, Remus, James, and Lily. Those four looked like they were in shock and before Sirius started walking to the front, Remus stood up and ran out of the Great Hall. He had paled and Sirius turned to look at him before he went to the front. If he could, then he would\u2019ve ran after his friend; he just couldn\u2019t in that moment.</p><p>He entered a room where the other two champions stood and they looked older than him. He was scared and his mouth was so dry that he couldn\u2019t speak. They smiled at him so wide and he wanted to turn around and act like he wasn\u2019t himself.</p><p>Charles walked up to him, a blonde boy with shoulder length hair, and patted him on the back. His smile was the biggest and Sirius\u2019s expression remained one of shock. \u201cNice to meet you, I\u2019m Charles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSirius, I\u2019m Sirius,\u201d the black haired boy said and Lucinda giggled.</p><p>\u201cYeah we\u2019re serious about this too,\u201d she said and her accent was so thick it was hard to even understand her.</p><p>\u201cNo, my name is Sirius Black,\u201d the fifth year said and Lucinda looked embarrassed, her cheeks bright red.</p><p>All talking ceased once Dumbledore entered with the other headmasters from the other schools. He gave Sirius a sad look, because he knew the boy hadn\u2019t expected to actually be chosen. The look made Sirius start to think about why he actually joined, why he hadn\u2019t backed out at the warning of Remus.</p><p>Originally he believed it was because he didn\u2019t want James to be alone or think of him as a coward, but he knew James would never think of him that way. It didn\u2019t matter whether or not James was alone because it wasn\u2019t in seriousness for the other. Part of Sirius had always clung to the words of eternal glory when Dumbledore said it and now here, he realized his true intentions.</p><p>He had wanted to show his family how he wasn\u2019t a disappointment. He may have hated them, but he didn\u2019t want to them to hate him. Sirius had always wanted love from his family and maybe the eternal glory would show them how he wasn\u2019t a disappointment. Maybe the eternal glory would make them love him.</p><p>Dumbledore spoke about how the first task would be in a month. They were allowed to leave and the Hogwarts headmaster approached Sirius, placed a hand on his shoulder to make sure he didn\u2019t walk away.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay to be scared, but just know everything will be okay. Hogwarts will stand behind you and I believe you will do great,\u201d Dumbledore said and Sirius knew the man didn\u2019t think he\u2019d win. Sirius wasn\u2019t sure if he really wanted to win, but he wanted the love his family would maybe give him if he won.</p><p>\u201cThank you, sir. I\u2019m going to get going now,\u201d Sirius said and the other nodded as the black haired boy walked down the corridors of the castle. He was worried about Remus, it had been the only thing on his mind once he left the other champions.</p><p>He didn\u2019t know where the other boy went and it was worrisome because he knew it would take a negative effect on him. As he walked down the corridors, people congratulated him and he was just nodded. Sirius didn\u2019t want to speak, because he didn\u2019t know what he would say.</p><p>Once he entered the Gryffindor Common Room, James and Peter sat there along with a lot of other students, but Remus was nowhere to be found. Sirius walked up to his friends as he ignored the cheers surrounding him, but they sighed and shook their heads.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not talking to anyone and no one knows where he is,\u201d James said and Peter looked at Sirius with a sad expression. The new champion whammed his fists into the table and growled since he didn\u2019t want Remus to shut them out.</p><p>\u201cWhy is he like this? I know he\u2019s scared, but hell I am too. Why is he punishing all of us for something we didn\u2019t expect to happen,\u201d Sirius snapped and a hand landed on his shoulder and he turned to see it belonged to Lily Evans.</p><p>\u201cYou know he\u2019s mad because he feels like he didn\u2019t try hard enough to prevent it. He\u2019s punishing himself,\u201d Lily said in a soft voice and James stood up and looked at her with angry eyes.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t put words in Remus\u2019s mouth and don\u2019t butt into things that don\u2019t concern you,\u201d James snapped and she flinched at his tone. For once, James didn\u2019t care it was Lily Evans speaking because it dealt with his best friends.</p><p>\u201cI was just trying to help, who ran after him when he ran out of the Great Hall? I did and he talked to me about things, so don\u2019t go snapping at me, Potter,\u201d she snapped back and got in his face from her aggression.</p><p>\u201cShut up both of you, the important part is to find Remus and make sure he\u2019s alright,\u201d Sirius said and James looked away from Lily to see how freaked out his best friend actually was. It was nearing full moon and Sirius was worried that Remus would hurt himself or not come back and end up roaming the castle as a wolf in the next couple days.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s okay, he just needs to be alone,\u201d Lily said and Sirius turned to look at her. There wasn\u2019t a word for his expression because he wasn\u2019t sure what he felt then.</p><p>\u201cI know you mean well, but he\u2019s our friend. I would\u2019ve ran after him if I could\u2019ve, but I was kind of in a bind. I just want to talk to him,\u201d Sirius pleaded and his unreadable expression melted into one of desperation.</p><p>Lily looked at him for a minute, almost to see if he was being genuine, and then shook her head. It was obvious he cared, but her expression made the boy wonder if he didn\u2019t care enough.</p><p>\u201cHe just needs some time alone, he told me he\u2019d go to class and meals. He actually promised me he would do so. Just give him time. You\u2019ve done it before and you can do it again,\u201d Lily said before she walked up the stairs to her dormitory. Sirius just watched her leave and he turned back to the table Peter was still seated at.</p><p>\u201cHe came around last time, he\u2019ll surely come around again,\u201d Peter tried to lighten the mood, but Sirius just shrugged and shook his head.</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t be so easy because he figured out that I actually wanted to be champion. He knew he almost had me back out, but part of me wished to do this,\u201d Sirius said and James looked at him shocked but didn\u2019t say anything.</p><p>\u201cWhy would you want to be in it?\u201d Peter asked and gave him a shrug, because he didn\u2019t want to talk about it then. He really didn\u2019t want to talk about it at all because he had been happier when he hadn\u2019t known himself.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just going to go to the dorm,\u201d Sirius said as he took a couple steps away from the two boys and was suddenly bombarded with attention of those around him.</p><p>\u201cSirius, it\u2019s so amazing how you became a champion!\u201d Emily, a sixth year, exclaimed as she threw an arm around his shoulders. He didn\u2019t move to wrap his arm around her and it caused her to huff. \u201cCome on, you\u2019re a man now, at least act the part.\u201d</p><p>When she pulled his hand up to the small of her back, he jumped away from her. It had nothing to do with the blonde girl, he knew she would make it that way, but it had to do with he couldn\u2019t handle anything right now. Remus had shut down when he needed him most and he really didn\u2019t want to deal with some sixth year girl trying to get with him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I\u2019m just tired and still in shock from everything that just happened. I\u2019ll be different in the morning,\u201d he said and she rolled her eyes before she walked away over to a group of girls in the corner of the room.</p><p>He felt weird rejecting someone due to his current state, because usually he didn\u2019t care how he felt. It was just how he felt so tired and dragged down from everything that had happened to the point where he wondered if he should just go to sleep for the night.</p><p>He walked up the staircase to the dormitories and ignored all those who kept trying to talk to him even with his gloomy demeanor. Sirius knew he\u2019d be different in the morning because the shock would fade and he\u2019d feel invincible.</p><p>It was just now, as he sat alone in the dorm, he wondered why he had even done this to begin with. James reasoning really was stupid if you thought about it, but he used it as an excuse to cover the real reason he entered. It was just he hadn\u2019t realized he had a real reason, but Remus had realized before the other did. Maybe he\u2019d blame his parents for the reason he entered and it would\u2019ve been easy if Remus hadn\u2019t of entered the room.</p><p>\u201cRemus, are you okay?\u201d Sirius asked and Remus stared at him in silence before he turned around and went to leave. He stood at the door a second and let out a shaky breath.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re greedy for attention, you know that right?\u201d Remus asked before he left without hearing Sirius\u2019s answer. It wasn\u2019t like the other boy had an answer, because he didn\u2019t know he was greedy.</p><p>His entire life Sirius had spent trying to earn his family\u2019s attention in a positive light, but he had never considered it greedy. He thought that wanting love wasn\u2019t greedy, but something every human just desired. Sirius continued to stare at the door, because maybe Remus would come back and Sirius could ask if maybe the other wanted love too. He wondered if his friend would do anything to get the love he had always wanted from his own parents.</p><p>When James and Peter entered the room, Sirius stood in the middle of it as he stared at the door. His thoughts are overtaken him and he wasn\u2019t sure if he could even move until James touched his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cDid Remus come in here?\u201d James asked and the other nodded. \u201cWhat did he say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe called me greedy for attention,\u201d he said before he went and sat down in his bed and sighed. \u201cIs he right? Was it greedy for attention to enter the tournament?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never thought you\u2019d make it in, so it\u2019s not greedy,\u201d James tried to soothe him and Sirius looked over at him before he laughed slightly.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to make it in. I wanted to have a reason show my parents I can do something they can be proud of. I thought he\u2019d understand that,\u201d Sirius said before he placed his face in his hands. He didn\u2019t want to cry and he\u2019d try his hardest not to.</p><p>\u201cThis is why families suck,\u201d Peter said and James turned to glare at the boy.</p><p>\u201cShut up, Pete.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d</p>",

He had researched the tournament when informed it would be occurring this year, and found it stupid and dangerous. Who the hell put kids into a tournament that could potentially kill them?</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cDrop the gloomy expression, Lupin, there are charming girls around,\u201d Sirius whispered as he nudged at him to make the brunette look up at him with an annoyed expression.</p><p>\u201cOf course all you\u2019re thinking about are the girls surrounding us,\u201d he said before he put his attention back to the wooden table. His fingers traced over the patterns in the wood before he looked at the headmaster.</p><p>\u201cOur sisters from Beauxbatons Academy and brothers from Drumstrang Institute have joined us this year to experience the Tri Wizard Tournament, but you must be 15 years old to enter. This tournament is not for the faint of heart and the eternal glory will be worth everything you\u2019ve ever dreamed of,\u201d Dumbledore explained before he showed the students the Goblet of Fire.</p><p>\u201cWe should all enter,\u201d James said and Remus looked over at the boy across the table from him to see the black haired boy with an excited expression. Remus responded with an annoyed look at his friends and a sigh.</p><p>\u201cI most definitely will not and neither should any of you. It\u2019s dangerous and we could die,\u201d Remus said and Sirius rolled his eyes at the brunette, which almost made Remus strangle him.</p><p>\u201cCome on, so many people will be entering and we\u2019ll most definitely not be chosen. It\u2019ll make Lily think I\u2019m brave. Or maybe one of those hot French girls,\u201d James said with a wink and Remus shook his head and then looked back to Dumbledore to ignore the conversation. He was tired of hearing his friends constantly talk about the girls surrounding them at all times.</p><p>The brunette didn\u2019t care if the chances were slim, because he wouldn\u2019t be taking any. At 15 years old, he didn\u2019t think he was ready to compete to the death (sure, it wasn\u2019t to the death, but it would be his luck to die). He chuckled to himself, because for a suicidal kid; he was picky on how he wanted to die.</p><p>Once again, Sirius nudged at Remus and the brunette blinked his eyes and looked at the other. He had zoned out, something he did a lot of now.</p><p>\u201cPeter had decided to not do it, but James and I are going to. We\u2019re thinking of waiting until it\u2019s the most crowded to do it or maybe just do it on Saturday,\u201d Sirius said and Remus rolled his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad Peter listens to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re welcome to join us by either just coming and watching or putting your name in,\u201d Sirius said and Remus sighed before nodding to joining. He wouldn\u2019t be joining the competition, but just joining them as an audience member to watch them put their names into the goblet. Maybe he could talk sense into them before they decided to do so.</p><p>\u201cI really hope neither of you get chosen,\u201d Remus said and Sirius chuckled before the two noticed food had filled the table. Talk of the tournament had ended the moment the four started to eat, and Remus was grateful because of it.</p><hr><p>\u201cListen, do you know how many Hogwarts\u2019 students are going to enter this thing? A shit ton, so you need to realize how we\u2019ll most likely not be chosen,\u201d James explained once again to Remus as the four boys sat in the dormitory.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not based off chances though, it\u2019s based off who it thinks is worthy and how far a person is will to go to win. What if it thinks you\u2019re worthy? What if it thinks you actually want to be chosen?\u201d Remus asked and James groaned at the questions.</p><p>\u201cDo you really think a magical goblet will think Sirius and I are worthy enough? No offense, Sirius,\u201d James said and the other black hair boy rolled his eyes at the comment. He wasn\u2019t hurt by it, but it was annoying to be spoken about as if he wasn\u2019t there.</p><p>\u201cSay it picks one of us for some reason, what\u2019s the harm in competing? There\u2019s been one death in the entire span of it, so it seems pretty safe,\u201d Sirius said and Remus gritted his teeth at the statement. Of course Sirius would try to justify it.</p><p>\u201cJust because someone survived from jumping off a bridge doesn\u2019t mean you should do it,\u201d Remus said and Sirius looked at him confused.</p><p>\u201cSomeone jumped off a bridge?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow are you so fucking stupid sometimes?\u201d Remus asked as he pinched the bridge of his nose and then gestured with his hands as he spoke. \u201cIt\u2019s a figure of speech, do you know what that is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I do, but I thought a task had been to jump off a bridge once,\u201d Sirius said and Remus shut his eyes and took another deep breath in.</p><p>\u201cI was trying to say that just because people have survived in the past doesn\u2019t mean that everyone always will. The tasks are fucking dangerous. Do you not remember Dumbledore saying that this isn\u2019t for the faint of heart?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think either of us will be chosen and there\u2019s no harm in entering. If you could get Lily to come, then maybe she\u2019ll think I\u2019m super cool and date me,\u201d James said and Remus shook his head.</p><p>\u201cNot rewarding this stupid idea,\u201d the brunette said and then Peter spoke up.</p><p>\u201cHow are you guys certain it won\u2019t pick you?\u201d Peter asked and Remus pointed at the other in agreement, the smug look on his face pissed Sirius off slightly.</p><p>\u201cIt most likely doesn\u2019t pick the youngest contestants, because obviously we\u2019re not the best just yet. Also neither of us want to really be in the competition, just have the attention that comes with entering,\u201d James said as if it was clear as day.</p><p>\u201cBut what if it does pick you, James? What if Lily just thinks you\u2019re stupid for entering and getting chosen?\u201d Peter asked and the black haired boy rubbed his eyes before looking at him.</p><p>\u201cIf I\u2019m a champion, then maybe some cute French girl and I can be a thing,\u201d James said and Remus laughed at that. It wasn\u2019t that he doubted his friend being capable of doing it, but it was the fact his friend wouldn\u2019t let go of Lily Evans no matter what happened.</p><p>\u201cAll of this is still a bad idea according to me. I\u2019m just worried you guys will actually get chosen, and I don\u2019t want anything bad happening to you,\u201d Remus said and Peter nodded in agreement.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Moony. I promise neither of us will be chosen. Let\u2019s just go to sleep now, okay?\u201d Sirius asked because he was tired of the arguing. It hurt his head and made him upset and uncertain on whether or not he should do it.</p><p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d Remus huffed as he got up to go to bathroom to brush his teeth. James stared at the door and then looked over at Sirius.</p><p>\u201cWhy is he acting like this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe because he\u2019s worried about you two,\u201d Peter suggested and the glare from James made the mousy boy stop talking.</p><p>\u201cCan we just stop talking about it now? Obviously it\u2019s going to be half the group against the other half in this situation,\u201d Sirius said and James sighed. It was obvious he wanted all of them to enter, but there was no amount of convincing that would make Remus or Peter join in on their plan.</p><p>When Remus returned to the room, he looked over at Sirius with a look the long haired boy couldn\u2019t read. The brunette got in bed, pulled the curtains to cover him completely, which wasn\u2019t out of the ordinary, but he never said goodnight to any of them.</p><p>Remus was upset and Sirius knew it was mainly with him for agreeing to James\u2019s plan. The problem was that even if Sirius didn\u2019t want to enter his name, he couldn\u2019t back out. He didn\u2019t want James to feel alone or see him as scared, but he didn\u2019t want to say that aloud; especially to Remus.</p><hr><p>\u201cAre you sure about this?\u201d Remus asked and Sirius chuckled at the brunette. Of course he\u2019d ask the question as they were walking to the Great Hall in order to enter.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re sure, just stop asking that,\u201d James responded and Remus sighed as the three continued to walk.</p><p>Sirius wasn\u2019t sure if he wanted to do this, but he didn\u2019t want James to do it alone. The thought of entering wasn\u2019t terrifying, but the thought of becoming a champion sure was. He shook his head and tried to get to get the thoughts Remus had put in there out.</p><p>\u201cI really don\u2019t think this is a good idea,\u201d Remus stated once they entered the room and Sirius laughed at that. He wanted to agree with the brunette, but he knew he couldn\u2019t and wouldn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cYou never think I have good ideas,\u201d James responded as he walked up to the cup and Remus watched as he put his name in.</p><p>\u201cWell, quite frankly, you never do have any good ideas. Typically they\u2019re not great, but this one is actually fairly bad,\u201d the brunette boy told his black haired friend only to get a snort in return. \u201cSirius, it\u2019s not too late to not do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHonestly, it kind of is and maybe this will help me get laid,\u201d Sirius said before throwing his name in the fire and multiple of the foreign girls were watching him from afar. He knew they hadn\u2019t heard what he had said because their expression didn\u2019t hold a disgusted look.</p><p>Remus had clenched fists by his side and growled slightly at the boy. The way he acted made Sirius and James take a step back from the temperamental boy.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re telling me that you\u2019ll risk your life to get fucking laid? Your logic of how too many people entering and it won\u2019t pick you shows how big of dumbasses you two are!\u201d Remus yelled and Sirius tried to contain a cool demeanor instead of a frightened one.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you need to get laid, Remy,\u201d he said and Remus shoved at the taller boy for using the nickname he hated. Sirius didn\u2019t know why he had used the name, especially in a time like this, but he was shoved because of it.</p><p>James quickly stepped in between the two to try to prevent a fight from breaking out. He knew Sirius wouldn\u2019t fight back when the other was like this, but James decided to take precautions.</p><p>\u201cHey, Remus, let\u2019s calm down,\u201d James said as he slowly edged his way up to the brunette. Remus may have been two inches shorter, but in this moment it seemed like he towered over James.</p><p>He shoved James away from him, into the floor, and strutted out of the Great Hall, anger seethed from him and everyone could tell. Sirius quickly helped up the other black haired boy and sighed in the direction of where Remus had left.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s near full moon,\u201d Sirius defended and James scoffed at the comment, but Sirius knew the other knew the reason was a valid one. Remus couldn\u2019t help how his moods and anger fluctuated, but Sirius knew this wasn\u2019t actually just a result from the brunette being a werewolf.</p><p>\u201cDo you think he\u2019s actually mad at us? Like to the point where he may not talk to us,\u201d James asked and Sirius didn\u2019t know the answer and didn\u2019t want to think about that. He didn\u2019t want to think about Remus shutting them out like he had done second year after he confessed he was a werewolf.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s hope not, because we\u2019re screwed without his brain. Sure, it was uncalled for, but we typically don\u2019t have great ideas,\u201d Sirius admitted and James nodded in agreement.</p><p>The two walked out of the Great Hall and saw Peter fidgeting as he walked towards them. He appeared to be fidgeting more than normal, which worried Sirius slightly.</p><p>\u201cHey, Peter, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d James asked and the nervous boy let out a deep breath.</p><p>\u201cRemus told me to tell you two that he won\u2019t be talking to either of you for a couple days or until he cools off. He also said don\u2019t talk to him or he\u2019ll hex you,\u201d Peter said slightly rushed and the two black haired boys stared at him in disbelief.</p><p>\u201cJust because we put our names in the goblet?\u201d Sirius asked and Peter shook his head. Of course there would be more so Remus could feel justified in his actions.</p><p>\u201cHe thinks you two don\u2019t care about him or his opinion,\u201d Peter said and James scoffed at the statement only to realize the brunette was being honest.</p><p>\u201cAre you bloody kidding me? We do one thing and he acts like a child!\u201d James yelled and Sirius just remained quiet. Usually he\u2019d be the one yelling, but he understood why Remus felt that way. The werewolf boy had asked them to not do it repeatedly, but they ignored him and kept telling him how it would be okay.</p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t listen to him about something that could put us in harm\u2019s way, which scares him,\u201d Sirius said and James stopped yelling once the other spoke. \u201cHe\u2019s scared we\u2019ll be picked and then die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe chances of that are slim though, doesn\u2019t he realize that? I thought this out, but he doesn\u2019t care about that,\u201d James complained and Sirius sighed in response. He was upset along with James, but he also had listened to everything Remus had said.</p><p>Neither of them spoke to the brunette boy. James didn\u2019t speak to him because he was angry at him as well, but Sirius didn\u2019t speak to him because he wasn\u2019t in the mood to get hexed.</p><hr><p>At first, Sirius and James didn\u2019t think Remus would actually shut them out, but when he didn\u2019t come to support them during their Qudditch practices, sat away from them at meals, and ignored the assigned seating so he wasn\u2019t near them; the duo started to worry.</p><p>They had known he was upset, but didn\u2019t realize it was this to extent. Nearly a week had gone by when Sirius decided he\u2019d just talk to the brunette. It didn\u2019t matter to him if he got hexed as long as he got to speak to his best friend.</p><p>\u201cRemus, we need to talk,\u201d Sirius said as he sat across the table from the other in the common room. The scarred boy looked up from his homework and rolled his eyes.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said before he looked back down at his homework and ignored the black haired boy seated across from him.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you so pissed? We put our names in there, so what? It never meant we don\u2019t care about you or anything you say,\u201d Sirius said and Remus looked up at him his an annoyed expression. The black haired boy worried it would turn into an aggressive one soon, but he tried to remain calm.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I don\u2019t want my friends to die, my fucking bad,\u201d Remus snapped before he slammed his book shut and looked at the other with an enraged look. \u201cYou get pissed at me constantly because I do something you don\u2019t like, but the moment I get pissed; I\u2019m being unreasonable!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMate, it\u2019s just that we never fucking acted or said we didn\u2019t care about you. We invited you to come with us and you did. We invited you to join us in putting your name in and you didn\u2019t. We didn\u2019t pressure you into anything, but we wanted to do it,\u201d Sirius said and he tried to remain calm for his own sake. If he blew up, then Remus would blow up ten times worse.</p><p>Remus looked at him with an expressionless face and it terrified the other boy, but Sirius didn\u2019t let his fear show. The scarred face brunette sighed and licked his lips as he thought, something he did quite regularly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just scared,\u201d Remus whispered and Sirius nodded, because he was slightly scared too. He couldn\u2019t admit it aloud, but maybe in this moment the other would understand how scared he was too.</p><p>\u201cI promise it\u2019s going to be okay, neither James nor I are going to be picked. Just have some faith,\u201d Sirius said and the other gave him a soft smile, one that wasn\u2019t noticeable unless you knew him.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019m sorry for being a prick,\u201d Remus muttered and Sirius smiled at him before he got up and threw an arm around the other.</p><p>\u201cGood, now let\u2019s go tell James the good news.\u201d</p><hr><p>\u201cSee that girl over there?\u201d Sirius asked and Remus looked up from his book to see one of the French girls staring at him only to look away quickly.</p><p>\u201cYeah, what about her?\u201d Remus asked unamused and Sirius gave him an annoyed look.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s been checking you out all this time, but all you ever do is check out books,\u201d Sirius said and James laughed at the joke his friend had made.</p><p>It was only the three boys since Peter was in detention for cheating on a test. McGonagall was being rough this year and the other boy had been stupid to think he could\u2019ve gotten away with it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather learn about the world than learn about some girl I\u2019ll never see again after this year,\u201d the brunette said before he turned his attention back down to his book.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s called a one night stand, Moony,\u201d James said and Remus looked over at him, through Sirius.</p><p>\u201cI taught you what that word was, along with the majority of your vocabulary, so shut the hell up,\u201d he snapped and over the last couple weeks the brunette had only grown grumpier and more aggressive. No one knew why because he was still fairly closed off from his friends since the last fight had happened.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s staring again,\u201d Sirius commented, not paying attention to his friends squabbling. The other two were always bickering, so Sirius never paid attention to it unless there was actual yelling involved.</p><p>The girl caught the stare of Sirius and he could tell she felt embarrassed by being caught, but still turned her attention back over to the brunette next to him. Although Sirius wasn\u2019t listening, he could tell the brunette was still arguing with James and it gave him time to observe the other.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t that Sirius thought Remus was unattractive by any means, but it was weird for foreign girls to find the scarred face attractive when a lot of people at Hogwarts didn\u2019t. Maybe the scars made him attractive? Or maybe the freckles that were located upon his cheeks and nose were what drew others in?</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you looking at?\u201d Remus asked with a hit of the black haired boy\u2019s shoulder and Sirius blinked his eyes a couple time before he shrugged. Had he really been staring at Remus so intensely he got lost in his own thoughts?</p><p>\u201cI was just thinking, guess I looked over at you at the wrong time,\u201d Sirius lied because he wasn\u2019t going to admit how he had been analyzing the freckles scattered across the other\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cWhatever, just don\u2019t do it again? It was weird,\u201d Remus said before he opened his book and started to read once more. Sirius looked over to see James no longer next to him but across the room next to Lily Evans.</p><p>James had a way of looking at Lily, almost as if he wanted to know every detail about her appearance. Sirius watched as the smile on James face diminished when he was most likely rejected once more and then the smile reappeared when he probably said how he\u2019d never give up.</p><p>\u201cDo you think he\u2019s serious when he says he\u2019ll never give up?\u201d Remus asked and Sirius snorted.</p><p>\u201cObviously I\u2019m Sirius, he\u2019s James. To think you call us your best friend,\u201d Sirius joked for a second and then noticed the annoyed expression of Remus\u2019s face. \u201cI think he\u2019s never going to give up, because it\u2019s a promise when he says it.\u201d</p><p>Remus fell silent once more and Sirius watched James walk over to the two. He had a smile on his face, something he told Sirius was how he\u2019d never cry or frown in public after being rejected. He didn\u2019t want to seem weak for his feelings and Sirius understood that, but he wondered if it was because they both came from pureblood houses.</p><p>\u201cWe should get going, see if Pete is done with detention yet,\u201d James said and the other two followed his lead, only to end up in an empty boys\u2019 bathroom. \u201cWhy doesn\u2019t she want me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMate, I think it\u2019s more of a she doesn\u2019t want anyone kind of thing,\u201d Remus said, trying to provide comfort while Sirius slung an arm around his best friend\u2019s shoulders.</p><p>\u201cJamie, she\u2019ll realize soon enough, just give her time. You\u2019re a catch,\u201d Sirius said before messing up his already messy hair to get a huff out of the other.</p><p>\u201cHow many times do I have to tell you to not call me Jamie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you\u2019re being girly, sometimes we have to.\u201d</p><hr><p>Weeks had passed and it was finally the night of announcement of the champions. All day Remus had been worried about who would be the champions, but Sirius continued to tell him it would be okay. James repeated his theory of how they wouldn\u2019t be chosen, but his words still didn\u2019t soothe the worried brunette.</p><p>Peter kept trying to back Sirius and James up, but he was shut down with the bitterness known as Remus Lupin. It was obvious that until the champions were announced, he wouldn\u2019t be calm or collected about it.</p><p>The brunette fidgeted at the Gryffindor table; his legs bounced up and down and his hands strummed along the table. His fingers made an annoying drumming sound and Sirius placed his hand over the other to stop the noise. The touch made the other jump and Sirius chuckled at Remus\u2019s nerves.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be okay, calm down. There\u2019s no way neither James nor I will be picked, remember that? We\u2019ve been over this repeatedly, remember?\u201d Sirius asked and Remus nodded. It didn\u2019t matter if he remembered or how many times they went over it, he was still scared.</p><p>\u201cI\u2013I know, but I have the right to be scared, okay? I have the right to worry my friends would be chosen and fucking die?\u201d Remus whispered over at him, worried others would hear them fight.</p><p>\u201cAlright, students, today we will find out our champions per school. Don\u2019t forget how big of an honor this and I hope you can support and congratulate them,\u201d Dumbledore began and the two boys fell silent in order to listen to what the man had to say.</p><p>Remus grabbed Sirius\u2019s hand under the table. His grip was tight and Sirius could feel all the fear in the other due to the racing heartbeat he felt. He wondered if maybe it was his own from being worried that he may be chosen, but he continued to remember the words James said about his reasoning of not being chosen.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll begin with Beauxbatons Academy,\u201d Dumbledore announced and a slip of paper came out and landed in the man\u2019s hand. He took a moment to read it before he looked back out at the students. \u201cLucinda Beaumont.\u201d</p><p>The girls from the academy started to clap, as well as the boys, for the brunette girl who stood up. Remus watched her walk down the aisles and saw the smile carved on her face. She was serious about this and Remus felt like if his friends weren\u2019t, then they shouldn\u2019t have entered, because this was for those who knew what they wanted. He looked over at Sirius and a shaky breath left his lips because what if Sirius was committed to this?</p><p>\u201cFrom Drumstrang Institute, we have Charles Elliot,\u201d Dumbledore announced and Remus had missed the name coming out from the Goblet due to his thoughts. He clutched Sirius\u2019s hand tighter since Hogwarts would be next.</p><p>\u201cFinally, Hogwarts,\u201d Dumbledore said and the paper exploded from the Goblet, something he hadn\u2019t done the last two times. Remus wasn\u2019t breathing and Lily tried to get him to breathe in the silence of Dumbledore reading the name. \u201cSirius Black.\u201d</p><p>Remus blinked and Sirius looked like he was in shock, because this hadn\u2019t been the plan. No one had thought he\u2019d actually be selected and Remus\u2019s hand went limp, no longer gripping to the other.</p><p>Sirius slowly stood up and people were clapping and cheering for him except Peter, Remus, James, and Lily. Those four looked like they were in shock and before Sirius started walking to the front, Remus stood up and ran out of the Great Hall. He had paled and Sirius turned to look at him before he went to the front. If he could, then he would\u2019ve ran after his friend; he just couldn\u2019t in that moment.</p><p>He entered a room where the other two champions stood and they looked older than him. He was scared and his mouth was so dry that he couldn\u2019t speak. They smiled at him so wide and he wanted to turn around and act like he wasn\u2019t himself.</p><p>Charles walked up to him, a blonde boy with shoulder length hair, and patted him on the back. His smile was the biggest and Sirius\u2019s expression remained one of shock. \u201cNice to meet you, I\u2019m Charles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSirius, I\u2019m Sirius,\u201d the black haired boy said and Lucinda giggled.</p><p>\u201cYeah we\u2019re serious about this too,\u201d she said and her accent was so thick it was hard to even understand her.</p><p>\u201cNo, my name is Sirius Black,\u201d the fifth year said and Lucinda looked embarrassed, her cheeks bright red.</p><p>All talking ceased once Dumbledore entered with the other headmasters from the other schools. He gave Sirius a sad look, because he knew the boy hadn\u2019t expected to actually be chosen. The look made Sirius start to think about why he actually joined, why he hadn\u2019t backed out at the warning of Remus.</p><p>Originally he believed it was because he didn\u2019t want James to be alone or think of him as a coward, but he knew James would never think of him that way. It didn\u2019t matter whether or not James was alone because it wasn\u2019t in seriousness for the other. Part of Sirius had always clung to the words of eternal glory when Dumbledore said it and now here, he realized his true intentions.</p><p>He had wanted to show his family how he wasn\u2019t a disappointment. He may have hated them, but he didn\u2019t want to them to hate him. Sirius had always wanted love from his family and maybe the eternal glory would show them how he wasn\u2019t a disappointment. Maybe the eternal glory would make them love him.</p><p>Dumbledore spoke about how the first task would be in a month. They were allowed to leave and the Hogwarts headmaster approached Sirius, placed a hand on his shoulder to make sure he didn\u2019t walk away.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay to be scared, but just know everything will be okay. Hogwarts will stand behind you and I believe you will do great,\u201d Dumbledore said and Sirius knew the man didn\u2019t think he\u2019d win. Sirius wasn\u2019t sure if he really wanted to win, but he wanted the love his family would maybe give him if he won.</p><p>\u201cThank you, sir. I\u2019m going to get going now,\u201d Sirius said and the other nodded as the black haired boy walked down the corridors of the castle. He was worried about Remus, it had been the only thing on his mind once he left the other champions.</p><p>He didn\u2019t know where the other boy went and it was worrisome because he knew it would take a negative effect on him. As he walked down the corridors, people congratulated him and he was just nodded. Sirius didn\u2019t want to speak, because he didn\u2019t know what he would say.</p><p>Once he entered the Gryffindor Common Room, James and Peter sat there along with a lot of other students, but Remus was nowhere to be found. Sirius walked up to his friends as he ignored the cheers surrounding him, but they sighed and shook their heads.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not talking to anyone and no one knows where he is,\u201d James said and Peter looked at Sirius with a sad expression. The new champion whammed his fists into the table and growled since he didn\u2019t want Remus to shut them out.</p><p>\u201cWhy is he like this? I know he\u2019s scared, but hell I am too. Why is he punishing all of us for something we didn\u2019t expect to happen,\u201d Sirius snapped and a hand landed on his shoulder and he turned to see it belonged to Lily Evans.</p><p>\u201cYou know he\u2019s mad because he feels like he didn\u2019t try hard enough to prevent it. He\u2019s punishing himself,\u201d Lily said in a soft voice and James stood up and looked at her with angry eyes.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t put words in Remus\u2019s mouth and don\u2019t butt into things that don\u2019t concern you,\u201d James snapped and she flinched at his tone. For once, James didn\u2019t care it was Lily Evans speaking because it dealt with his best friends.</p><p>\u201cI was just trying to help, who ran after him when he ran out of the Great Hall? I did and he talked to me about things, so don\u2019t go snapping at me, Potter,\u201d she snapped back and got in his face from her aggression.</p><p>\u201cShut up both of you, the important part is to find Remus and make sure he\u2019s alright,\u201d Sirius said and James looked away from Lily to see how freaked out his best friend actually was. It was nearing full moon and Sirius was worried that Remus would hurt himself or not come back and end up roaming the castle as a wolf in the next couple days.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s okay, he just needs to be alone,\u201d Lily said and Sirius turned to look at her. There wasn\u2019t a word for his expression because he wasn\u2019t sure what he felt then.</p><p>\u201cI know you mean well, but he\u2019s our friend. I would\u2019ve ran after him if I could\u2019ve, but I was kind of in a bind. I just want to talk to him,\u201d Sirius pleaded and his unreadable expression melted into one of desperation.</p><p>Lily looked at him for a minute, almost to see if he was being genuine, and then shook her head. It was obvious he cared, but her expression made the boy wonder if he didn\u2019t care enough.</p><p>\u201cHe just needs some time alone, he told me he\u2019d go to class and meals. He actually promised me he would do so. Just give him time. You\u2019ve done it before and you can do it again,\u201d Lily said before she walked up the stairs to her dormitory. Sirius just watched her leave and he turned back to the table Peter was still seated at.</p><p>\u201cHe came around last time, he\u2019ll surely come around again,\u201d Peter tried to lighten the mood, but Sirius just shrugged and shook his head.</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t be so easy because he figured out that I actually wanted to be champion. He knew he almost had me back out, but part of me wished to do this,\u201d Sirius said and James looked at him shocked but didn\u2019t say anything.</p><p>\u201cWhy would you want to be in it?\u201d Peter asked and gave him a shrug, because he didn\u2019t want to talk about it then. He really didn\u2019t want to talk about it at all because he had been happier when he hadn\u2019t known himself.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just going to go to the dorm,\u201d Sirius said as he took a couple steps away from the two boys and was suddenly bombarded with attention of those around him.</p><p>\u201cSirius, it\u2019s so amazing how you became a champion!\u201d Emily, a sixth year, exclaimed as she threw an arm around his shoulders. He didn\u2019t move to wrap his arm around her and it caused her to huff. \u201cCome on, you\u2019re a man now, at least act the part.\u201d</p><p>When she pulled his hand up to the small of her back, he jumped away from her. It had nothing to do with the blonde girl, he knew she would make it that way, but it had to do with he couldn\u2019t handle anything right now. Remus had shut down when he needed him most and he really didn\u2019t want to deal with some sixth year girl trying to get with him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I\u2019m just tired and still in shock from everything that just happened. I\u2019ll be different in the morning,\u201d he said and she rolled her eyes before she walked away over to a group of girls in the corner of the room.</p><p>He felt weird rejecting someone due to his current state, because usually he didn\u2019t care how he felt. It was just how he felt so tired and dragged down from everything that had happened to the point where he wondered if he should just go to sleep for the night.</p><p>He walked up the staircase to the dormitories and ignored all those who kept trying to talk to him even with his gloomy demeanor. Sirius knew he\u2019d be different in the morning because the shock would fade and he\u2019d feel invincible.</p><p>It was just now, as he sat alone in the dorm, he wondered why he had even done this to begin with. James reasoning really was stupid if you thought about it, but he used it as an excuse to cover the real reason he entered. It was just he hadn\u2019t realized he had a real reason, but Remus had realized before the other did. Maybe he\u2019d blame his parents for the reason he entered and it would\u2019ve been easy if Remus hadn\u2019t of entered the room.</p><p>\u201cRemus, are you okay?\u201d Sirius asked and Remus stared at him in silence before he turned around and went to leave. He stood at the door a second and let out a shaky breath.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re greedy for attention, you know that right?\u201d Remus asked before he left without hearing Sirius\u2019s answer. It wasn\u2019t like the other boy had an answer, because he didn\u2019t know he was greedy.</p><p>His entire life Sirius had spent trying to earn his family\u2019s attention in a positive light, but he had never considered it greedy. He thought that wanting love wasn\u2019t greedy, but something every human just desired. Sirius continued to stare at the door, because maybe Remus would come back and Sirius could ask if maybe the other wanted love too. He wondered if his friend would do anything to get the love he had always wanted from his own parents.</p><p>When James and Peter entered the room, Sirius stood in the middle of it as he stared at the door. His thoughts are overtaken him and he wasn\u2019t sure if he could even move until James touched his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cDid Remus come in here?\u201d James asked and the other nodded. \u201cWhat did he say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe called me greedy for attention,\u201d he said before he went and sat down in his bed and sighed. \u201cIs he right? Was it greedy for attention to enter the tournament?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never thought you\u2019d make it in, so it\u2019s not greedy,\u201d James tried to soothe him and Sirius looked over at him before he laughed slightly.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to make it in. I wanted to have a reason show my parents I can do something they can be proud of. I thought he\u2019d understand that,\u201d Sirius said before he placed his face in his hands. He didn\u2019t want to cry and he\u2019d try his hardest not to.</p><p>\u201cThis is why families suck,\u201d Peter said and James turned to glare at the boy.</p><p>\u201cShut up, Pete.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d</p>",

The Triwizard Tournament was occurring this year, which explained the foreign students and the upset feeling in his gut.</p><p>The brunette looked at the table because he didn\u2019t want to deal with this currently. He had researched the tournament when informed it would be occurring this year, and found it stupid and dangerous. Who the hell put kids into a tournament that could potentially kill them?</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cDrop the gloomy expression, Lupin, there are charming girls around,\u201d Sirius whispered as he nudged at him to make the brunette look up at him with an annoyed expression.</p><p>\u201cOf course all you\u2019re thinking about are the girls surrounding us,\u201d he said before he put his attention back to the wooden table. His fingers traced over the patterns in the wood before he looked at the headmaster.</p><p>\u201cOur sisters from Beauxbatons Academy and brothers from Drumstrang Institute have joined us this year to experience the Tri Wizard Tournament, but you must be 15 years old to enter. This tournament is not for the faint of heart and the eternal glory will be worth everything you\u2019ve ever dreamed of,\u201d Dumbledore explained before he showed the students the Goblet of Fire.</p><p>\u201cWe should all enter,\u201d James said and Remus looked over at the boy across the table from him to see the black haired boy with an excited expression. Remus responded with an annoyed look at his friends and a sigh.</p><p>\u201cI most definitely will not and neither should any of you. It\u2019s dangerous and we could die,\u201d Remus said and Sirius rolled his eyes at the brunette, which almost made Remus strangle him.</p><p>\u201cCome on, so many people will be entering and we\u2019ll most definitely not be chosen. It\u2019ll make Lily think I\u2019m brave. Or maybe one of those hot French girls,\u201d James said with a wink and Remus shook his head and then looked back to Dumbledore to ignore the conversation. He was tired of hearing his friends constantly talk about the girls surrounding them at all times.</p><p>The brunette didn\u2019t care if the chances were slim, because he wouldn\u2019t be taking any. At 15 years old, he didn\u2019t think he was ready to compete to the death (sure, it wasn\u2019t to the death, but it would be his luck to die). He chuckled to himself, because for a suicidal kid; he was picky on how he wanted to die.</p><p>Once again, Sirius nudged at Remus and the brunette blinked his eyes and looked at the other. He had zoned out, something he did a lot of now.</p><p>\u201cPeter had decided to not do it, but James and I are going to. We\u2019re thinking of waiting until it\u2019s the most crowded to do it or maybe just do it on Saturday,\u201d Sirius said and Remus rolled his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad Peter listens to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re welcome to join us by either just coming and watching or putting your name in,\u201d Sirius said and Remus sighed before nodding to joining. He wouldn\u2019t be joining the competition, but just joining them as an audience member to watch them put their names into the goblet. Maybe he could talk sense into them before they decided to do so.</p><p>\u201cI really hope neither of you get chosen,\u201d Remus said and Sirius chuckled before the two noticed food had filled the table. Talk of the tournament had ended the moment the four started to eat, and Remus was grateful because of it.</p><hr><p>\u201cListen, do you know how many Hogwarts\u2019 students are going to enter this thing? A shit ton, so you need to realize how we\u2019ll most likely not be chosen,\u201d James explained once again to Remus as the four boys sat in the dormitory.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not based off chances though, it\u2019s based off who it thinks is worthy and how far a person is will to go to win. What if it thinks you\u2019re worthy? What if it thinks you actually want to be chosen?\u201d Remus asked and James groaned at the questions.</p><p>\u201cDo you really think a magical goblet will think Sirius and I are worthy enough? No offense, Sirius,\u201d James said and the other black hair boy rolled his eyes at the comment. He wasn\u2019t hurt by it, but it was annoying to be spoken about as if he wasn\u2019t there.</p><p>\u201cSay it picks one of us for some reason, what\u2019s the harm in competing? There\u2019s been one death in the entire span of it, so it seems pretty safe,\u201d Sirius said and Remus gritted his teeth at the statement. Of course Sirius would try to justify it.</p><p>\u201cJust because someone survived from jumping off a bridge doesn\u2019t mean you should do it,\u201d Remus said and Sirius looked at him confused.</p><p>\u201cSomeone jumped off a bridge?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow are you so fucking stupid sometimes?\u201d Remus asked as he pinched the bridge of his nose and then gestured with his hands as he spoke. \u201cIt\u2019s a figure of speech, do you know what that is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I do, but I thought a task had been to jump off a bridge once,\u201d Sirius said and Remus shut his eyes and took another deep breath in.</p><p>\u201cI was trying to say that just because people have survived in the past doesn\u2019t mean that everyone always will. The tasks are fucking dangerous. Do you not remember Dumbledore saying that this isn\u2019t for the faint of heart?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think either of us will be chosen and there\u2019s no harm in entering. If you could get Lily to come, then maybe she\u2019ll think I\u2019m super cool and date me,\u201d James said and Remus shook his head.</p><p>\u201cNot rewarding this stupid idea,\u201d the brunette said and then Peter spoke up.</p><p>\u201cHow are you guys certain it won\u2019t pick you?\u201d Peter asked and Remus pointed at the other in agreement, the smug look on his face pissed Sirius off slightly.</p><p>\u201cIt most likely doesn\u2019t pick the youngest contestants, because obviously we\u2019re not the best just yet. Also neither of us want to really be in the competition, just have the attention that comes with entering,\u201d James said as if it was clear as day.</p><p>\u201cBut what if it does pick you, James? What if Lily just thinks you\u2019re stupid for entering and getting chosen?\u201d Peter asked and the black haired boy rubbed his eyes before looking at him.</p><p>\u201cIf I\u2019m a champion, then maybe some cute French girl and I can be a thing,\u201d James said and Remus laughed at that. It wasn\u2019t that he doubted his friend being capable of doing it, but it was the fact his friend wouldn\u2019t let go of Lily Evans no matter what happened.</p><p>\u201cAll of this is still a bad idea according to me. I\u2019m just worried you guys will actually get chosen, and I don\u2019t want anything bad happening to you,\u201d Remus said and Peter nodded in agreement.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Moony. I promise neither of us will be chosen. Let\u2019s just go to sleep now, okay?\u201d Sirius asked because he was tired of the arguing. It hurt his head and made him upset and uncertain on whether or not he should do it.</p><p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d Remus huffed as he got up to go to bathroom to brush his teeth. James stared at the door and then looked over at Sirius.</p><p>\u201cWhy is he acting like this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe because he\u2019s worried about you two,\u201d Peter suggested and the glare from James made the mousy boy stop talking.</p><p>\u201cCan we just stop talking about it now? Obviously it\u2019s going to be half the group against the other half in this situation,\u201d Sirius said and James sighed. It was obvious he wanted all of them to enter, but there was no amount of convincing that would make Remus or Peter join in on their plan.</p><p>When Remus returned to the room, he looked over at Sirius with a look the long haired boy couldn\u2019t read. The brunette got in bed, pulled the curtains to cover him completely, which wasn\u2019t out of the ordinary, but he never said goodnight to any of them.</p><p>Remus was upset and Sirius knew it was mainly with him for agreeing to James\u2019s plan. The problem was that even if Sirius didn\u2019t want to enter his name, he couldn\u2019t back out. He didn\u2019t want James to feel alone or see him as scared, but he didn\u2019t want to say that aloud; especially to Remus.</p><hr><p>\u201cAre you sure about this?\u201d Remus asked and Sirius chuckled at the brunette. Of course he\u2019d ask the question as they were walking to the Great Hall in order to enter.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re sure, just stop asking that,\u201d James responded and Remus sighed as the three continued to walk.</p><p>Sirius wasn\u2019t sure if he wanted to do this, but he didn\u2019t want James to do it alone. The thought of entering wasn\u2019t terrifying, but the thought of becoming a champion sure was. He shook his head and tried to get to get the thoughts Remus had put in there out.</p><p>\u201cI really don\u2019t think this is a good idea,\u201d Remus stated once they entered the room and Sirius laughed at that. He wanted to agree with the brunette, but he knew he couldn\u2019t and wouldn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cYou never think I have good ideas,\u201d James responded as he walked up to the cup and Remus watched as he put his name in.</p><p>\u201cWell, quite frankly, you never do have any good ideas. Typically they\u2019re not great, but this one is actually fairly bad,\u201d the brunette boy told his black haired friend only to get a snort in return. \u201cSirius, it\u2019s not too late to not do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHonestly, it kind of is and maybe this will help me get laid,\u201d Sirius said before throwing his name in the fire and multiple of the foreign girls were watching him from afar. He knew they hadn\u2019t heard what he had said because their expression didn\u2019t hold a disgusted look.</p><p>Remus had clenched fists by his side and growled slightly at the boy. The way he acted made Sirius and James take a step back from the temperamental boy.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re telling me that you\u2019ll risk your life to get fucking laid? Your logic of how too many people entering and it won\u2019t pick you shows how big of dumbasses you two are!\u201d Remus yelled and Sirius tried to contain a cool demeanor instead of a frightened one.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you need to get laid, Remy,\u201d he said and Remus shoved at the taller boy for using the nickname he hated. Sirius didn\u2019t know why he had used the name, especially in a time like this, but he was shoved because of it.</p><p>James quickly stepped in between the two to try to prevent a fight from breaking out. He knew Sirius wouldn\u2019t fight back when the other was like this, but James decided to take precautions.</p><p>\u201cHey, Remus, let\u2019s calm down,\u201d James said as he slowly edged his way up to the brunette. Remus may have been two inches shorter, but in this moment it seemed like he towered over James.</p><p>He shoved James away from him, into the floor, and strutted out of the Great Hall, anger seethed from him and everyone could tell. Sirius quickly helped up the other black haired boy and sighed in the direction of where Remus had left.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s near full moon,\u201d Sirius defended and James scoffed at the comment, but Sirius knew the other knew the reason was a valid one. Remus couldn\u2019t help how his moods and anger fluctuated, but Sirius knew this wasn\u2019t actually just a result from the brunette being a werewolf.</p><p>\u201cDo you think he\u2019s actually mad at us? Like to the point where he may not talk to us,\u201d James asked and Sirius didn\u2019t know the answer and didn\u2019t want to think about that. He didn\u2019t want to think about Remus shutting them out like he had done second year after he confessed he was a werewolf.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s hope not, because we\u2019re screwed without his brain. Sure, it was uncalled for, but we typically don\u2019t have great ideas,\u201d Sirius admitted and James nodded in agreement.</p><p>The two walked out of the Great Hall and saw Peter fidgeting as he walked towards them. He appeared to be fidgeting more than normal, which worried Sirius slightly.</p><p>\u201cHey, Peter, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d James asked and the nervous boy let out a deep breath.</p><p>\u201cRemus told me to tell you two that he won\u2019t be talking to either of you for a couple days or until he cools off. He also said don\u2019t talk to him or he\u2019ll hex you,\u201d Peter said slightly rushed and the two black haired boys stared at him in disbelief.</p><p>\u201cJust because we put our names in the goblet?\u201d Sirius asked and Peter shook his head. Of course there would be more so Remus could feel justified in his actions.</p><p>\u201cHe thinks you two don\u2019t care about him or his opinion,\u201d Peter said and James scoffed at the statement only to realize the brunette was being honest.</p><p>\u201cAre you bloody kidding me? We do one thing and he acts like a child!\u201d James yelled and Sirius just remained quiet. Usually he\u2019d be the one yelling, but he understood why Remus felt that way. The werewolf boy had asked them to not do it repeatedly, but they ignored him and kept telling him how it would be okay.</p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t listen to him about something that could put us in harm\u2019s way, which scares him,\u201d Sirius said and James stopped yelling once the other spoke. \u201cHe\u2019s scared we\u2019ll be picked and then die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe chances of that are slim though, doesn\u2019t he realize that? I thought this out, but he doesn\u2019t care about that,\u201d James complained and Sirius sighed in response. He was upset along with James, but he also had listened to everything Remus had said.</p><p>Neither of them spoke to the brunette boy. James didn\u2019t speak to him because he was angry at him as well, but Sirius didn\u2019t speak to him because he wasn\u2019t in the mood to get hexed.</p><hr><p>At first, Sirius and James didn\u2019t think Remus would actually shut them out, but when he didn\u2019t come to support them during their Qudditch practices, sat away from them at meals, and ignored the assigned seating so he wasn\u2019t near them; the duo started to worry.</p><p>They had known he was upset, but didn\u2019t realize it was this to extent. Nearly a week had gone by when Sirius decided he\u2019d just talk to the brunette. It didn\u2019t matter to him if he got hexed as long as he got to speak to his best friend.</p><p>\u201cRemus, we need to talk,\u201d Sirius said as he sat across the table from the other in the common room. The scarred boy looked up from his homework and rolled his eyes.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said before he looked back down at his homework and ignored the black haired boy seated across from him.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you so pissed? We put our names in there, so what? It never meant we don\u2019t care about you or anything you say,\u201d Sirius said and Remus looked up at him his an annoyed expression. The black haired boy worried it would turn into an aggressive one soon, but he tried to remain calm.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I don\u2019t want my friends to die, my fucking bad,\u201d Remus snapped before he slammed his book shut and looked at the other with an enraged look. \u201cYou get pissed at me constantly because I do something you don\u2019t like, but the moment I get pissed; I\u2019m being unreasonable!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMate, it\u2019s just that we never fucking acted or said we didn\u2019t care about you. We invited you to come with us and you did. We invited you to join us in putting your name in and you didn\u2019t. We didn\u2019t pressure you into anything, but we wanted to do it,\u201d Sirius said and he tried to remain calm for his own sake. If he blew up, then Remus would blow up ten times worse.</p><p>Remus looked at him with an expressionless face and it terrified the other boy, but Sirius didn\u2019t let his fear show. The scarred face brunette sighed and licked his lips as he thought, something he did quite regularly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just scared,\u201d Remus whispered and Sirius nodded, because he was slightly scared too. He couldn\u2019t admit it aloud, but maybe in this moment the other would understand how scared he was too.</p><p>\u201cI promise it\u2019s going to be okay, neither James nor I are going to be picked. Just have some faith,\u201d Sirius said and the other gave him a soft smile, one that wasn\u2019t noticeable unless you knew him.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019m sorry for being a prick,\u201d Remus muttered and Sirius smiled at him before he got up and threw an arm around the other.</p><p>\u201cGood, now let\u2019s go tell James the good news.\u201d</p><hr><p>\u201cSee that girl over there?\u201d Sirius asked and Remus looked up from his book to see one of the French girls staring at him only to look away quickly.</p><p>\u201cYeah, what about her?\u201d Remus asked unamused and Sirius gave him an annoyed look.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s been checking you out all this time, but all you ever do is check out books,\u201d Sirius said and James laughed at the joke his friend had made.</p><p>It was only the three boys since Peter was in detention for cheating on a test. McGonagall was being rough this year and the other boy had been stupid to think he could\u2019ve gotten away with it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather learn about the world than learn about some girl I\u2019ll never see again after this year,\u201d the brunette said before he turned his attention back down to his book.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s called a one night stand, Moony,\u201d James said and Remus looked over at him, through Sirius.</p><p>\u201cI taught you what that word was, along with the majority of your vocabulary, so shut the hell up,\u201d he snapped and over the last couple weeks the brunette had only grown grumpier and more aggressive. No one knew why because he was still fairly closed off from his friends since the last fight had happened.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s staring again,\u201d Sirius commented, not paying attention to his friends squabbling. The other two were always bickering, so Sirius never paid attention to it unless there was actual yelling involved.</p><p>The girl caught the stare of Sirius and he could tell she felt embarrassed by being caught, but still turned her attention back over to the brunette next to him. Although Sirius wasn\u2019t listening, he could tell the brunette was still arguing with James and it gave him time to observe the other.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t that Sirius thought Remus was unattractive by any means, but it was weird for foreign girls to find the scarred face attractive when a lot of people at Hogwarts didn\u2019t. Maybe the scars made him attractive? Or maybe the freckles that were located upon his cheeks and nose were what drew others in?</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you looking at?\u201d Remus asked with a hit of the black haired boy\u2019s shoulder and Sirius blinked his eyes a couple time before he shrugged. Had he really been staring at Remus so intensely he got lost in his own thoughts?</p><p>\u201cI was just thinking, guess I looked over at you at the wrong time,\u201d Sirius lied because he wasn\u2019t going to admit how he had been analyzing the freckles scattered across the other\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cWhatever, just don\u2019t do it again? It was weird,\u201d Remus said before he opened his book and started to read once more. Sirius looked over to see James no longer next to him but across the room next to Lily Evans.</p><p>James had a way of looking at Lily, almost as if he wanted to know every detail about her appearance. Sirius watched as the smile on James face diminished when he was most likely rejected once more and then the smile reappeared when he probably said how he\u2019d never give up.</p><p>\u201cDo you think he\u2019s serious when he says he\u2019ll never give up?\u201d Remus asked and Sirius snorted.</p><p>\u201cObviously I\u2019m Sirius, he\u2019s James. To think you call us your best friend,\u201d Sirius joked for a second and then noticed the annoyed expression of Remus\u2019s face. \u201cI think he\u2019s never going to give up, because it\u2019s a promise when he says it.\u201d</p><p>Remus fell silent once more and Sirius watched James walk over to the two. He had a smile on his face, something he told Sirius was how he\u2019d never cry or frown in public after being rejected. He didn\u2019t want to seem weak for his feelings and Sirius understood that, but he wondered if it was because they both came from pureblood houses.</p><p>\u201cWe should get going, see if Pete is done with detention yet,\u201d James said and the other two followed his lead, only to end up in an empty boys\u2019 bathroom. \u201cWhy doesn\u2019t she want me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMate, I think it\u2019s more of a she doesn\u2019t want anyone kind of thing,\u201d Remus said, trying to provide comfort while Sirius slung an arm around his best friend\u2019s shoulders.</p><p>\u201cJamie, she\u2019ll realize soon enough, just give her time. You\u2019re a catch,\u201d Sirius said before messing up his already messy hair to get a huff out of the other.</p><p>\u201cHow many times do I have to tell you to not call me Jamie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you\u2019re being girly, sometimes we have to.\u201d</p><hr><p>Weeks had passed and it was finally the night of announcement of the champions. All day Remus had been worried about who would be the champions, but Sirius continued to tell him it would be okay. James repeated his theory of how they wouldn\u2019t be chosen, but his words still didn\u2019t soothe the worried brunette.</p><p>Peter kept trying to back Sirius and James up, but he was shut down with the bitterness known as Remus Lupin. It was obvious that until the champions were announced, he wouldn\u2019t be calm or collected about it.</p><p>The brunette fidgeted at the Gryffindor table; his legs bounced up and down and his hands strummed along the table. His fingers made an annoying drumming sound and Sirius placed his hand over the other to stop the noise. The touch made the other jump and Sirius chuckled at Remus\u2019s nerves.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be okay, calm down. There\u2019s no way neither James nor I will be picked, remember that? We\u2019ve been over this repeatedly, remember?\u201d Sirius asked and Remus nodded. It didn\u2019t matter if he remembered or how many times they went over it, he was still scared.</p><p>\u201cI\u2013I know, but I have the right to be scared, okay? I have the right to worry my friends would be chosen and fucking die?\u201d Remus whispered over at him, worried others would hear them fight.</p><p>\u201cAlright, students, today we will find out our champions per school. Don\u2019t forget how big of an honor this and I hope you can support and congratulate them,\u201d Dumbledore began and the two boys fell silent in order to listen to what the man had to say.</p><p>Remus grabbed Sirius\u2019s hand under the table. His grip was tight and Sirius could feel all the fear in the other due to the racing heartbeat he felt. He wondered if maybe it was his own from being worried that he may be chosen, but he continued to remember the words James said about his reasoning of not being chosen.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll begin with Beauxbatons Academy,\u201d Dumbledore announced and a slip of paper came out and landed in the man\u2019s hand. He took a moment to read it before he looked back out at the students. \u201cLucinda Beaumont.\u201d</p><p>The girls from the academy started to clap, as well as the boys, for the brunette girl who stood up. Remus watched her walk down the aisles and saw the smile carved on her face. She was serious about this and Remus felt like if his friends weren\u2019t, then they shouldn\u2019t have entered, because this was for those who knew what they wanted. He looked over at Sirius and a shaky breath left his lips because what if Sirius was committed to this?</p><p>\u201cFrom Drumstrang Institute, we have Charles Elliot,\u201d Dumbledore announced and Remus had missed the name coming out from the Goblet due to his thoughts. He clutched Sirius\u2019s hand tighter since Hogwarts would be next.</p><p>\u201cFinally, Hogwarts,\u201d Dumbledore said and the paper exploded from the Goblet, something he hadn\u2019t done the last two times. Remus wasn\u2019t breathing and Lily tried to get him to breathe in the silence of Dumbledore reading the name. \u201cSirius Black.\u201d</p><p>Remus blinked and Sirius looked like he was in shock, because this hadn\u2019t been the plan. No one had thought he\u2019d actually be selected and Remus\u2019s hand went limp, no longer gripping to the other.</p><p>Sirius slowly stood up and people were clapping and cheering for him except Peter, Remus, James, and Lily. Those four looked like they were in shock and before Sirius started walking to the front, Remus stood up and ran out of the Great Hall. He had paled and Sirius turned to look at him before he went to the front. If he could, then he would\u2019ve ran after his friend; he just couldn\u2019t in that moment.</p><p>He entered a room where the other two champions stood and they looked older than him. He was scared and his mouth was so dry that he couldn\u2019t speak. They smiled at him so wide and he wanted to turn around and act like he wasn\u2019t himself.</p><p>Charles walked up to him, a blonde boy with shoulder length hair, and patted him on the back. His smile was the biggest and Sirius\u2019s expression remained one of shock. \u201cNice to meet you, I\u2019m Charles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSirius, I\u2019m Sirius,\u201d the black haired boy said and Lucinda giggled.</p><p>\u201cYeah we\u2019re serious about this too,\u201d she said and her accent was so thick it was hard to even understand her.</p><p>\u201cNo, my name is Sirius Black,\u201d the fifth year said and Lucinda looked embarrassed, her cheeks bright red.</p><p>All talking ceased once Dumbledore entered with the other headmasters from the other schools. He gave Sirius a sad look, because he knew the boy hadn\u2019t expected to actually be chosen. The look made Sirius start to think about why he actually joined, why he hadn\u2019t backed out at the warning of Remus.</p><p>Originally he believed it was because he didn\u2019t want James to be alone or think of him as a coward, but he knew James would never think of him that way. It didn\u2019t matter whether or not James was alone because it wasn\u2019t in seriousness for the other. Part of Sirius had always clung to the words of eternal glory when Dumbledore said it and now here, he realized his true intentions.</p><p>He had wanted to show his family how he wasn\u2019t a disappointment. He may have hated them, but he didn\u2019t want to them to hate him. Sirius had always wanted love from his family and maybe the eternal glory would show them how he wasn\u2019t a disappointment. Maybe the eternal glory would make them love him.</p><p>Dumbledore spoke about how the first task would be in a month. They were allowed to leave and the Hogwarts headmaster approached Sirius, placed a hand on his shoulder to make sure he didn\u2019t walk away.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay to be scared, but just know everything will be okay. Hogwarts will stand behind you and I believe you will do great,\u201d Dumbledore said and Sirius knew the man didn\u2019t think he\u2019d win. Sirius wasn\u2019t sure if he really wanted to win, but he wanted the love his family would maybe give him if he won.</p><p>\u201cThank you, sir. I\u2019m going to get going now,\u201d Sirius said and the other nodded as the black haired boy walked down the corridors of the castle. He was worried about Remus, it had been the only thing on his mind once he left the other champions.</p><p>He didn\u2019t know where the other boy went and it was worrisome because he knew it would take a negative effect on him. As he walked down the corridors, people congratulated him and he was just nodded. Sirius didn\u2019t want to speak, because he didn\u2019t know what he would say.</p><p>Once he entered the Gryffindor Common Room, James and Peter sat there along with a lot of other students, but Remus was nowhere to be found. Sirius walked up to his friends as he ignored the cheers surrounding him, but they sighed and shook their heads.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not talking to anyone and no one knows where he is,\u201d James said and Peter looked at Sirius with a sad expression. The new champion whammed his fists into the table and growled since he didn\u2019t want Remus to shut them out.</p><p>\u201cWhy is he like this? I know he\u2019s scared, but hell I am too. Why is he punishing all of us for something we didn\u2019t expect to happen,\u201d Sirius snapped and a hand landed on his shoulder and he turned to see it belonged to Lily Evans.</p><p>\u201cYou know he\u2019s mad because he feels like he didn\u2019t try hard enough to prevent it. He\u2019s punishing himself,\u201d Lily said in a soft voice and James stood up and looked at her with angry eyes.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t put words in Remus\u2019s mouth and don\u2019t butt into things that don\u2019t concern you,\u201d James snapped and she flinched at his tone. For once, James didn\u2019t care it was Lily Evans speaking because it dealt with his best friends.</p><p>\u201cI was just trying to help, who ran after him when he ran out of the Great Hall? I did and he talked to me about things, so don\u2019t go snapping at me, Potter,\u201d she snapped back and got in his face from her aggression.</p><p>\u201cShut up both of you, the important part is to find Remus and make sure he\u2019s alright,\u201d Sirius said and James looked away from Lily to see how freaked out his best friend actually was. It was nearing full moon and Sirius was worried that Remus would hurt himself or not come back and end up roaming the castle as a wolf in the next couple days.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s okay, he just needs to be alone,\u201d Lily said and Sirius turned to look at her. There wasn\u2019t a word for his expression because he wasn\u2019t sure what he felt then.</p><p>\u201cI know you mean well, but he\u2019s our friend. I would\u2019ve ran after him if I could\u2019ve, but I was kind of in a bind. I just want to talk to him,\u201d Sirius pleaded and his unreadable expression melted into one of desperation.</p><p>Lily looked at him for a minute, almost to see if he was being genuine, and then shook her head. It was obvious he cared, but her expression made the boy wonder if he didn\u2019t care enough.</p><p>\u201cHe just needs some time alone, he told me he\u2019d go to class and meals. He actually promised me he would do so. Just give him time. You\u2019ve done it before and you can do it again,\u201d Lily said before she walked up the stairs to her dormitory. Sirius just watched her leave and he turned back to the table Peter was still seated at.</p><p>\u201cHe came around last time, he\u2019ll surely come around again,\u201d Peter tried to lighten the mood, but Sirius just shrugged and shook his head.</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t be so easy because he figured out that I actually wanted to be champion. He knew he almost had me back out, but part of me wished to do this,\u201d Sirius said and James looked at him shocked but didn\u2019t say anything.</p><p>\u201cWhy would you want to be in it?\u201d Peter asked and gave him a shrug, because he didn\u2019t want to talk about it then. He really didn\u2019t want to talk about it at all because he had been happier when he hadn\u2019t known himself.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just going to go to the dorm,\u201d Sirius said as he took a couple steps away from the two boys and was suddenly bombarded with attention of those around him.</p><p>\u201cSirius, it\u2019s so amazing how you became a champion!\u201d Emily, a sixth year, exclaimed as she threw an arm around his shoulders. He didn\u2019t move to wrap his arm around her and it caused her to huff. \u201cCome on, you\u2019re a man now, at least act the part.\u201d</p><p>When she pulled his hand up to the small of her back, he jumped away from her. It had nothing to do with the blonde girl, he knew she would make it that way, but it had to do with he couldn\u2019t handle anything right now. Remus had shut down when he needed him most and he really didn\u2019t want to deal with some sixth year girl trying to get with him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I\u2019m just tired and still in shock from everything that just happened. I\u2019ll be different in the morning,\u201d he said and she rolled her eyes before she walked away over to a group of girls in the corner of the room.</p><p>He felt weird rejecting someone due to his current state, because usually he didn\u2019t care how he felt. It was just how he felt so tired and dragged down from everything that had happened to the point where he wondered if he should just go to sleep for the night.</p><p>He walked up the staircase to the dormitories and ignored all those who kept trying to talk to him even with his gloomy demeanor. Sirius knew he\u2019d be different in the morning because the shock would fade and he\u2019d feel invincible.</p><p>It was just now, as he sat alone in the dorm, he wondered why he had even done this to begin with. James reasoning really was stupid if you thought about it, but he used it as an excuse to cover the real reason he entered. It was just he hadn\u2019t realized he had a real reason, but Remus had realized before the other did. Maybe he\u2019d blame his parents for the reason he entered and it would\u2019ve been easy if Remus hadn\u2019t of entered the room.</p><p>\u201cRemus, are you okay?\u201d Sirius asked and Remus stared at him in silence before he turned around and went to leave. He stood at the door a second and let out a shaky breath.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re greedy for attention, you know that right?\u201d Remus asked before he left without hearing Sirius\u2019s answer. It wasn\u2019t like the other boy had an answer, because he didn\u2019t know he was greedy.</p><p>His entire life Sirius had spent trying to earn his family\u2019s attention in a positive light, but he had never considered it greedy. He thought that wanting love wasn\u2019t greedy, but something every human just desired. Sirius continued to stare at the door, because maybe Remus would come back and Sirius could ask if maybe the other wanted love too. He wondered if his friend would do anything to get the love he had always wanted from his own parents.</p><p>When James and Peter entered the room, Sirius stood in the middle of it as he stared at the door. His thoughts are overtaken him and he wasn\u2019t sure if he could even move until James touched his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cDid Remus come in here?\u201d James asked and the other nodded. \u201cWhat did he say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe called me greedy for attention,\u201d he said before he went and sat down in his bed and sighed. \u201cIs he right? Was it greedy for attention to enter the tournament?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never thought you\u2019d make it in, so it\u2019s not greedy,\u201d James tried to soothe him and Sirius looked over at him before he laughed slightly.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to make it in. I wanted to have a reason show my parents I can do something they can be proud of. I thought he\u2019d understand that,\u201d Sirius said before he placed his face in his hands. He didn\u2019t want to cry and he\u2019d try his hardest not to.</p><p>\u201cThis is why families suck,\u201d Peter said and James turned to glare at the boy.</p><p>\u201cShut up, Pete.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d</p>",

The Triwizard Tournament was occurring this year, which explained the foreign students and the upset feeling in his gut.</p><p>The brunette looked at the table because he didn&rsquo;t want to deal with this currently. He had researched the tournament when informed it would be occurring this year, and found it stupid and dangerous. Who the hell put kids into a tournament that could potentially kill them?</p><p>&ldquo;Drop the gloomy expression, Lupin, there are charming girls around,&rdquo; Sirius whispered as he nudged at him to make the brunette look up at him with an annoyed expression.</p><p>&ldquo;Of course all you&rsquo;re thinking about are the girls surrounding us,&rdquo; he said before he put his attention back to the wooden table. His fingers traced over the patterns in the wood before he looked at the headmaster.</p><p>&ldquo;Our sisters from Beauxbatons Academy and brothers from Drumstrang Institute have joined us this year to experience the Tri Wizard Tournament, but you must be 15 years old to enter. This tournament is not for the faint of heart and the eternal glory will be worth everything you&rsquo;ve ever dreamed of,&rdquo; Dumbledore explained before he showed the students the Goblet of Fire.</p><p>&ldquo;We should all enter,&rdquo; James said and Remus looked over at the boy across the table from him to see the black haired boy with an excited expression. Remus responded with an annoyed look at his friends and a sigh.</p><p>&ldquo;I most definitely will not and neither should any of you. It&rsquo;s dangerous and we could die,&rdquo; Remus said and Sirius rolled his eyes at the brunette, which almost made Remus strangle him.</p><p>&ldquo;Come on, so many people will be entering and we&rsquo;ll most definitely not be chosen. It&rsquo;ll make Lily think I&rsquo;m brave. Or maybe one of those hot French girls,&rdquo; James said with a wink and Remus shook his head and then looked back to Dumbledore to ignore the conversation. He was tired of hearing his friends constantly talk about the girls surrounding them at all times.</p><p>The brunette didn&rsquo;t care if the chances were slim, because he wouldn&rsquo;t be taking any. At 15 years old, he didn&rsquo;t think he was ready to compete to the death (sure, it wasn&rsquo;t to the death, but it would be his luck to die). He chuckled to himself, because for a suicidal kid; he was picky on how he wanted to die.</p><p>Once again, Sirius nudged at Remus and the brunette blinked his eyes and looked at the other. He had zoned out, something he did a lot of now.</p><p>&ldquo;Peter had decided to not do it, but James and I are going to. We&rsquo;re thinking of waiting until it&rsquo;s the most crowded to do it or maybe just do it on Saturday,&rdquo; Sirius said and Remus rolled his eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad Peter listens to me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;re welcome to join us by either just coming and watching or putting your name in,&rdquo; Sirius said and Remus sighed before nodding to joining. He wouldn&rsquo;t be joining the competition, but just joining them as an audience member to watch them put their names into the goblet. Maybe he could talk sense into them before they decided to do so.</p><p>&ldquo;I really hope neither of you get chosen,&rdquo; Remus said and Sirius chuckled before the two noticed food had filled the table. Talk of the tournament had ended the moment the four started to eat, and Remus was grateful because of it.</p><hr /><p>&ldquo;Listen, do you know how many Hogwarts&rsquo; students are going to enter this thing? A shit ton, so you need to realize how we&rsquo;ll most likely not be chosen,&rdquo; James explained once again to Remus as the four boys sat in the dormitory.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not based off chances though, it&rsquo;s based off who it thinks is worthy and how far a person is will to go to win. What if it thinks you&rsquo;re worthy? What if it thinks you actually want to be chosen?&rdquo; Remus asked and James groaned at the questions.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you really think a magical goblet will think Sirius and I are worthy enough? No offense, Sirius,&rdquo; James said and the other black hair boy rolled his eyes at the comment. He wasn&rsquo;t hurt by it, but it was annoying to be spoken about as if he wasn&rsquo;t there.</p><p>&ldquo;Say it picks one of us for some reason, what&rsquo;s the harm in competing? There&rsquo;s been one death in the entire span of it, so it seems pretty safe,&rdquo; Sirius said and Remus gritted his teeth at the statement. Of course Sirius would try to justify it.</p><p>&ldquo;Just because someone survived from jumping off a bridge doesn&rsquo;t mean you should do it,&rdquo; Remus said and Sirius looked at him confused.</p><p>&ldquo;Someone jumped off a bridge?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How are you so fucking stupid sometimes?&rdquo; Remus asked as he pinched the bridge of his nose and then gestured with his hands as he spoke. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a figure of speech, do you know what that is?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, I do, but I thought a task had been to jump off a bridge once,&rdquo; Sirius said and Remus shut his eyes and took another deep breath in.</p><p>&ldquo;I was trying to say that just because people have survived in the past doesn&rsquo;t mean that everyone always will. The tasks are fucking dangerous. Do you not remember Dumbledore saying that this isn&rsquo;t for the faint of heart?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think either of us will be chosen and there&rsquo;s no harm in entering. If you could get Lily to come, then maybe she&rsquo;ll think I&rsquo;m super cool and date me,&rdquo; James said and Remus shook his head.</p><p>&ldquo;Not rewarding this stupid idea,&rdquo; the brunette said and then Peter spoke up.</p><p>&ldquo;How are you guys certain it won&rsquo;t pick you?&rdquo; Peter asked and Remus pointed at the other in agreement, the smug look on his face pissed Sirius off slightly.</p><p>&ldquo;It most likely doesn&rsquo;t pick the youngest contestants, because obviously we&rsquo;re not the best just yet. Also neither of us want to really be in the competition, just have the attention that comes with entering,&rdquo; James said as if it was clear as day.</p><p>&ldquo;But what if it does pick you, James? What if Lily just thinks you&rsquo;re stupid for entering and getting chosen?&rdquo; Peter asked and the black haired boy rubbed his eyes before looking at him.</p><p>&ldquo;If I&rsquo;m a champion, then maybe some cute French girl and I can be a thing,&rdquo; James said and Remus laughed at that. It wasn&rsquo;t that he doubted his friend being capable of doing it, but it was the fact his friend wouldn&rsquo;t let go of Lily Evans no matter what happened.</p><p>&ldquo;All of this is still a bad idea according to me. I&rsquo;m just worried you guys will actually get chosen, and I don&rsquo;t want anything bad happening to you,&rdquo; Remus said and Peter nodded in agreement.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, Moony. I promise neither of us will be chosen. Let&rsquo;s just go to sleep now, okay?&rdquo; Sirius asked because he was tired of the arguing. It hurt his head and made him upset and uncertain on whether or not he should do it.</p><p>&ldquo;Whatever,&rdquo; Remus huffed as he got up to go to bathroom to brush his teeth. James stared at the door and then looked over at Sirius.</p><p>&ldquo;Why is he acting like this?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Maybe because he&rsquo;s worried about you two,&rdquo; Peter suggested and the glare from James made the mousy boy stop talking.</p><p>&ldquo;Can we just stop talking about it now? Obviously it&rsquo;s going to be half the group against the other half in this situation,&rdquo; Sirius said and James sighed. It was obvious he wanted all of them to enter, but there was no amount of convincing that would make Remus or Peter join in on their plan.</p><p>When Remus returned to the room, he looked over at Sirius with a look the long haired boy couldn&rsquo;t read. The brunette got in bed, pulled the curtains to cover him completely, which wasn&rsquo;t out of the ordinary, but he never said goodnight to any of them.</p><p>Remus was upset and Sirius knew it was mainly with him for agreeing to James&rsquo;s plan. The problem was that even if Sirius didn&rsquo;t want to enter his name, he couldn&rsquo;t back out. He didn&rsquo;t want James to feel alone or see him as scared, but he didn&rsquo;t want to say that aloud; especially to Remus.</p><hr /><p>&ldquo;Are you sure about this?&rdquo; Remus asked and Sirius chuckled at the brunette. Of course he&rsquo;d ask the question as they were walking to the Great Hall in order to enter.</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re sure, just stop asking that,&rdquo; James responded and Remus sighed as the three continued to walk.</p><p>Sirius wasn&rsquo;t sure if he wanted to do this, but he didn&rsquo;t want James to do it alone. The thought of entering wasn&rsquo;t terrifying, but the thought of becoming a champion sure was. He shook his head and tried to get to get the thoughts Remus had put in there out.</p><p>&ldquo;I really don&rsquo;t think this is a good idea,&rdquo; Remus stated once they entered the room and Sirius laughed at that. He wanted to agree with the brunette, but he knew he couldn&rsquo;t and wouldn&rsquo;t.</p><p>&ldquo;You never think I have good ideas,&rdquo; James responded as he walked up to the cup and Remus watched as he put his name in.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, quite frankly, you never do have any good ideas. Typically they&rsquo;re not great, but this one is actually fairly bad,&rdquo; the brunette boy told his black haired friend only to get a snort in return. &ldquo;Sirius, it&rsquo;s not too late to not do this.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Honestly, it kind of is and maybe this will help me get laid,&rdquo; Sirius said before throwing his name in the fire and multiple of the foreign girls were watching him from afar. He knew they hadn&rsquo;t heard what he had said because their expression didn&rsquo;t hold a disgusted look.</p><p>Remus had clenched fists by his side and growled slightly at the boy. The way he acted made Sirius and James take a step back from the temperamental boy.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re telling me that you&rsquo;ll risk your life to get fucking laid? Your logic of how too many people entering and it won&rsquo;t pick you shows how big of dumbasses you two are!&rdquo; Remus yelled and Sirius tried to contain a cool demeanor instead of a frightened one.</p><p>&ldquo;Maybe you need to get laid, Remy,&rdquo; he said and Remus shoved at the taller boy for using the nickname he hated. Sirius didn&rsquo;t know why he had used the name, especially in a time like this, but he was shoved because of it.</p><p>James quickly stepped in between the two to try to prevent a fight from breaking out. He knew Sirius wouldn&rsquo;t fight back when the other was like this, but James decided to take precautions.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, Remus, let&rsquo;s calm down,&rdquo; James said as he slowly edged his way up to the brunette. Remus may have been two inches shorter, but in this moment it seemed like he towered over James.</p><p>He shoved James away from him, into the floor, and strutted out of the Great Hall, anger seethed from him and everyone could tell. Sirius quickly helped up the other black haired boy and sighed in the direction of where Remus had left.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s near full moon,&rdquo; Sirius defended and James scoffed at the comment, but Sirius knew the other knew the reason was a valid one. Remus couldn&rsquo;t help how his moods and anger fluctuated, but Sirius knew this wasn&rsquo;t actually just a result from the brunette being a werewolf.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you think he&rsquo;s actually mad at us? Like to the point where he may not talk to us,&rdquo; James asked and Sirius didn&rsquo;t know the answer and didn&rsquo;t want to think about that. He didn&rsquo;t want to think about Remus shutting them out like he had done second year after he confessed he was a werewolf.</p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s hope not, because we&rsquo;re screwed without his brain. Sure, it was uncalled for, but we typically don&rsquo;t have great ideas,&rdquo; Sirius admitted and James nodded in agreement.</p><p>The two walked out of the Great Hall and saw Peter fidgeting as he walked towards them. He appeared to be fidgeting more than normal, which worried Sirius slightly.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, Peter, what&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; James asked and the nervous boy let out a deep breath.</p><p>&ldquo;Remus told me to tell you two that he won&rsquo;t be talking to either of you for a couple days or until he cools off. He also said don&rsquo;t talk to him or he&rsquo;ll hex you,&rdquo; Peter said slightly rushed and the two black haired boys stared at him in disbelief.</p><p>&ldquo;Just because we put our names in the goblet?&rdquo; Sirius asked and Peter shook his head. Of course there would be more so Remus could feel justified in his actions.</p><p>&ldquo;He thinks you two don&rsquo;t care about him or his opinion,&rdquo; Peter said and James scoffed at the statement only to realize the brunette was being honest.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you bloody kidding me? We do one thing and he acts like a child!&rdquo; James yelled and Sirius just remained quiet. Usually he&rsquo;d be the one yelling, but he understood why Remus felt that way. The werewolf boy had asked them to not do it repeatedly, but they ignored him and kept telling him how it would be okay.</p><p>&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t listen to him about something that could put us in harm&rsquo;s way, which scares him,&rdquo; Sirius said and James stopped yelling once the other spoke. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s scared we&rsquo;ll be picked and then die.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The chances of that are slim though, doesn&rsquo;t he realize that? I thought this out, but he doesn&rsquo;t care about that,&rdquo; James complained and Sirius sighed in response. He was upset along with James, but he also had listened to everything Remus had said.</p><p>Neither of them spoke to the brunette boy. James didn&rsquo;t speak to him because he was angry at him as well, but Sirius didn&rsquo;t speak to him because he wasn&rsquo;t in the mood to get hexed.</p><hr /><p>At first, Sirius and James didn&rsquo;t think Remus would actually shut them out, but when he didn&rsquo;t come to support them during their Qudditch practices, sat away from them at meals, and ignored the assigned seating so he wasn&rsquo;t near them; the duo started to worry.</p><p>They had known he was upset, but didn&rsquo;t realize it was this to extent. Nearly a week had gone by when Sirius decided he&rsquo;d just talk to the brunette. It didn&rsquo;t matter to him if he got hexed as long as he got to speak to his best friend.</p><p>&ldquo;Remus, we need to talk,&rdquo; Sirius said as he sat across the table from the other in the common room. The scarred boy looked up from his homework and rolled his eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said before he looked back down at his homework and ignored the black haired boy seated across from him.</p><p>&ldquo;Why are you so pissed? We put our names in there, so what? It never meant we don&rsquo;t care about you or anything you say,&rdquo; Sirius said and Remus looked up at him his an annoyed expression. The black haired boy worried it would turn into an aggressive one soon, but he tried to remain calm.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry I don&rsquo;t want my friends to die, my fucking bad,&rdquo; Remus snapped before he slammed his book shut and looked at the other with an enraged look. &ldquo;You get pissed at me constantly because I do something you don&rsquo;t like, but the moment I get pissed; I&rsquo;m being unreasonable!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Mate, it&rsquo;s just that we never fucking acted or said we didn&rsquo;t care about you. We invited you to come with us and you did. We invited you to join us in putting your name in and you didn&rsquo;t. We didn&rsquo;t pressure you into anything, but we wanted to do it,&rdquo; Sirius said and he tried to remain calm for his own sake. If he blew up, then Remus would blow up ten times worse.</p><p>Remus looked at him with an expressionless face and it terrified the other boy, but Sirius didn&rsquo;t let his fear show. The scarred face brunette sighed and licked his lips as he thought, something he did quite regularly.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just scared,&rdquo; Remus whispered and Sirius nodded, because he was slightly scared too. He couldn&rsquo;t admit it aloud, but maybe in this moment the other would understand how scared he was too.</p><p>&ldquo;I promise it&rsquo;s going to be okay, neither James nor I are going to be picked. Just have some faith,&rdquo; Sirius said and the other gave him a soft smile, one that wasn&rsquo;t noticeable unless you knew him.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, I&rsquo;m sorry for being a prick,&rdquo; Remus muttered and Sirius smiled at him before he got up and threw an arm around the other.</p><p>&ldquo;Good, now let&rsquo;s go tell James the good news.&rdquo;</p><hr /><p>&ldquo;See that girl over there?&rdquo; Sirius asked and Remus looked up from his book to see one of the French girls staring at him only to look away quickly.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, what about her?&rdquo; Remus asked unamused and Sirius gave him an annoyed look.</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s been checking you out all this time, but all you ever do is check out books,&rdquo; Sirius said and James laughed at the joke his friend had made.</p><p>It was only the three boys since Peter was in detention for cheating on a test. McGonagall was being rough this year and the other boy had been stupid to think he could&rsquo;ve gotten away with it.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather learn about the world than learn about some girl I&rsquo;ll never see again after this year,&rdquo; the brunette said before he turned his attention back down to his book.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s called a one night stand, Moony,&rdquo; James said and Remus looked over at him, through Sirius.</p><p>&ldquo;I taught you what that word was, along with the majority of your vocabulary, so shut the hell up,&rdquo; he snapped and over the last couple weeks the brunette had only grown grumpier and more aggressive. No one knew why because he was still fairly closed off from his friends since the last fight had happened.</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s staring again,&rdquo; Sirius commented, not paying attention to his friends squabbling. The other two were always bickering, so Sirius never paid attention to it unless there was actual yelling involved.</p><p>The girl caught the stare of Sirius and he could tell she felt embarrassed by being caught, but still turned her attention back over to the brunette next to him. Although Sirius wasn&rsquo;t listening, he could tell the brunette was still arguing with James and it gave him time to observe the other.</p><p>It wasn&rsquo;t that Sirius thought Remus was unattractive by any means, but it was weird for foreign girls to find the scarred face attractive when a lot of people at Hogwarts didn&rsquo;t. Maybe the scars made him attractive? Or maybe the freckles that were located upon his cheeks and nose were what drew others in?</p><p>&ldquo;What the hell are you looking at?&rdquo; Remus asked with a hit of the black haired boy&rsquo;s shoulder and Sirius blinked his eyes a couple time before he shrugged. Had he really been staring at Remus so intensely he got lost in his own thoughts?</p><p>&ldquo;I was just thinking, guess I looked over at you at the wrong time,&rdquo; Sirius lied because he wasn&rsquo;t going to admit how he had been analyzing the freckles scattered across the other&rsquo;s face.</p><p>&ldquo;Whatever, just don&rsquo;t do it again? It was weird,&rdquo; Remus said before he opened his book and started to read once more. Sirius looked over to see James no longer next to him but across the room next to Lily Evans.</p><p>James had a way of looking at Lily, almost as if he wanted to know every detail about her appearance. Sirius watched as the smile on James face diminished when he was most likely rejected once more and then the smile reappeared when he probably said how he&rsquo;d never give up.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you think he&rsquo;s serious when he says he&rsquo;ll never give up?&rdquo; Remus asked and Sirius snorted.</p><p>&ldquo;Obviously I&rsquo;m Sirius, he&rsquo;s James. To think you call us your best friend,&rdquo; Sirius joked for a second and then noticed the annoyed expression of Remus&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;I think he&rsquo;s never going to give up, because it&rsquo;s a promise when he says it.&rdquo;</p><p>Remus fell silent once more and Sirius watched James walk over to the two. He had a smile on his face, something he told Sirius was how he&rsquo;d never cry or frown in public after being rejected. He didn&rsquo;t want to seem weak for his feelings and Sirius understood that, but he wondered if it was because they both came from pureblood houses.</p><p>&ldquo;We should get going, see if Pete is done with detention yet,&rdquo; James said and the other two followed his lead, only to end up in an empty boys&rsquo; bathroom. &ldquo;Why doesn&rsquo;t she want me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Mate, I think it&rsquo;s more of a she doesn&rsquo;t want anyone kind of thing,&rdquo; Remus said, trying to provide comfort while Sirius slung an arm around his best friend&rsquo;s shoulders.</p><p>&ldquo;Jamie, she&rsquo;ll realize soon enough, just give her time. You&rsquo;re a catch,&rdquo; Sirius said before messing up his already messy hair to get a huff out of the other.</p><p>&ldquo;How many times do I have to tell you to not call me Jamie?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;When you&rsquo;re being girly, sometimes we have to.&rdquo;</p><hr /><p>Weeks had passed and it was finally the night of announcement of the champions. All day Remus had been worried about who would be the champions, but Sirius continued to tell him it would be okay. James repeated his theory of how they wouldn&rsquo;t be chosen, but his words still didn&rsquo;t soothe the worried brunette.</p><p>Peter kept trying to back Sirius and James up, but he was shut down with the bitterness known as Remus Lupin. It was obvious that until the champions were announced, he wouldn&rsquo;t be calm or collected about it.</p><p>The brunette fidgeted at the Gryffindor table; his legs bounced up and down and his hands strummed along the table. His fingers made an annoying drumming sound and Sirius placed his hand over the other to stop the noise. The touch made the other jump and Sirius chuckled at Remus&rsquo;s nerves.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to be okay, calm down. There&rsquo;s no way neither James nor I will be picked, remember that? We&rsquo;ve been over this repeatedly, remember?&rdquo; Sirius asked and Remus nodded. It didn&rsquo;t matter if he remembered or how many times they went over it, he was still scared.</p><p>&ldquo;I&ndash;I know, but I have the right to be scared, okay? I have the right to worry my friends would be chosen and fucking die?&rdquo; Remus whispered over at him, worried others would hear them fight.</p><p>&ldquo;Alright, students, today we will find out our champions per school. Don&rsquo;t forget how big of an honor this and I hope you can support and congratulate them,&rdquo; Dumbledore began and the two boys fell silent in order to listen to what the man had to say.</p><p>Remus grabbed Sirius&rsquo;s hand under the table. His grip was tight and Sirius could feel all the fear in the other due to the racing heartbeat he felt. He wondered if maybe it was his own from being worried that he may be chosen, but he continued to remember the words James said about his reasoning of not being chosen.</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll begin with Beauxbatons Academy,&rdquo; Dumbledore announced and a slip of paper came out and landed in the man&rsquo;s hand. He took a moment to read it before he looked back out at the students. &ldquo;Lucinda Beaumont.&rdquo;</p><p>The girls from the academy started to clap, as well as the boys, for the brunette girl who stood up. Remus watched her walk down the aisles and saw the smile carved on her face. She was serious about this and Remus felt like if his friends weren&rsquo;t, then they shouldn&rsquo;t have entered, because this was for those who knew what they wanted. He looked over at Sirius and a shaky breath left his lips because what if Sirius was committed to this?</p><p>&ldquo;From Drumstrang Institute, we have Charles Elliot,&rdquo; Dumbledore announced and Remus had missed the name coming out from the Goblet due to his thoughts. He clutched Sirius&rsquo;s hand tighter since Hogwarts would be next.</p><p>&ldquo;Finally, Hogwarts,&rdquo; Dumbledore said and the paper exploded from the Goblet, something he hadn&rsquo;t done the last two times. Remus wasn&rsquo;t breathing and Lily tried to get him to breathe in the silence of Dumbledore reading the name. &ldquo;Sirius Black.&rdquo;</p><p>Remus blinked and Sirius looked like he was in shock, because this hadn&rsquo;t been the plan. No one had thought he&rsquo;d actually be selected and Remus&rsquo;s hand went limp, no longer gripping to the other.</p><p>Sirius slowly stood up and people were clapping and cheering for him except Peter, Remus, James, and Lily. Those four looked like they were in shock and before Sirius started walking to the front, Remus stood up and ran out of the Great Hall. He had paled and Sirius turned to look at him before he went to the front. If he could, then he would&rsquo;ve ran after his friend; he just couldn&rsquo;t in that moment.</p><p>He entered a room where the other two champions stood and they looked older than him. He was scared and his mouth was so dry that he couldn&rsquo;t speak. They smiled at him so wide and he wanted to turn around and act like he wasn&rsquo;t himself.</p><p>Charles walked up to him, a blonde boy with shoulder length hair, and patted him on the back. His smile was the biggest and Sirius&rsquo;s expression remained one of shock. &ldquo;Nice to meet you, I&rsquo;m Charles.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sirius, I&rsquo;m Sirius,&rdquo; the black haired boy said and Lucinda giggled.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah we&rsquo;re serious about this too,&rdquo; she said and her accent was so thick it was hard to even understand her.</p><p>&ldquo;No, my name is Sirius Black,&rdquo; the fifth year said and Lucinda looked embarrassed, her cheeks bright red.</p><p>All talking ceased once Dumbledore entered with the other headmasters from the other schools. He gave Sirius a sad look, because he knew the boy hadn&rsquo;t expected to actually be chosen. The look made Sirius start to think about why he actually joined, why he hadn&rsquo;t backed out at the warning of Remus.</p><p>Originally he believed it was because he didn&rsquo;t want James to be alone or think of him as a coward, but he knew James would never think of him that way. It didn&rsquo;t matter whether or not James was alone because it wasn&rsquo;t in seriousness for the other. Part of Sirius had always clung to the words of eternal glory when Dumbledore said it and now here, he realized his true intentions.</p><p>He had wanted to show his family how he wasn&rsquo;t a disappointment. He may have hated them, but he didn&rsquo;t want to them to hate him. Sirius had always wanted love from his family and maybe the eternal glory would show them how he wasn&rsquo;t a disappointment. Maybe the eternal glory would make them love him.</p><p>Dumbledore spoke about how the first task would be in a month. They were allowed to leave and the Hogwarts headmaster approached Sirius, placed a hand on his shoulder to make sure he didn&rsquo;t walk away.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay to be scared, but just know everything will be okay. Hogwarts will stand behind you and I believe you will do great,&rdquo; Dumbledore said and Sirius knew the man didn&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;d win. Sirius wasn&rsquo;t sure if he really wanted to win, but he wanted the love his family would maybe give him if he won.</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you, sir. I&rsquo;m going to get going now,&rdquo; Sirius said and the other nodded as the black haired boy walked down the corridors of the castle. He was worried about Remus, it had been the only thing on his mind once he left the other champions.</p><p>He didn&rsquo;t know where the other boy went and it was worrisome because he knew it would take a negative effect on him. As he walked down the corridors, people congratulated him and he was just nodded. Sirius didn&rsquo;t want to speak, because he didn&rsquo;t know what he would say.</p><p>Once he entered the Gryffindor Common Room, James and Peter sat there along with a lot of other students, but Remus was nowhere to be found. Sirius walked up to his friends as he ignored the cheers surrounding him, but they sighed and shook their heads.</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not talking to anyone and no one knows where he is,&rdquo; James said and Peter looked at Sirius with a sad expression. The new champion whammed his fists into the table and growled since he didn&rsquo;t want Remus to shut them out.</p><p>&ldquo;Why is he like this? I know he&rsquo;s scared, but hell I am too. Why is he punishing all of us for something we didn&rsquo;t expect to happen,&rdquo; Sirius snapped and a hand landed on his shoulder and he turned to see it belonged to Lily Evans.</p><p>&ldquo;You know he&rsquo;s mad because he feels like he didn&rsquo;t try hard enough to prevent it. He&rsquo;s punishing himself,&rdquo; Lily said in a soft voice and James stood up and looked at her with angry eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t put words in Remus&rsquo;s mouth and don&rsquo;t butt into things that don&rsquo;t concern you,&rdquo; James snapped and she flinched at his tone. For once, James didn&rsquo;t care it was Lily Evans speaking because it dealt with his best friends.</p><p>&ldquo;I was just trying to help, who ran after him when he ran out of the Great Hall? I did and he talked to me about things, so don&rsquo;t go snapping at me, Potter,&rdquo; she snapped back and got in his face from her aggression.</p><p>&ldquo;Shut up both of you, the important part is to find Remus and make sure he&rsquo;s alright,&rdquo; Sirius said and James looked away from Lily to see how freaked out his best friend actually was. It was nearing full moon and Sirius was worried that Remus would hurt himself or not come back and end up roaming the castle as a wolf in the next couple days.</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s okay, he just needs to be alone,&rdquo; Lily said and Sirius turned to look at her. There wasn&rsquo;t a word for his expression because he wasn&rsquo;t sure what he felt then.</p><p>&ldquo;I know you mean well, but he&rsquo;s our friend. I would&rsquo;ve ran after him if I could&rsquo;ve, but I was kind of in a bind. I just want to talk to him,&rdquo; Sirius pleaded and his unreadable expression melted into one of desperation.</p><p>Lily looked at him for a minute, almost to see if he was being genuine, and then shook her head. It was obvious he cared, but her expression made the boy wonder if he didn&rsquo;t care enough.</p><p>&ldquo;He just needs some time alone, he told me he&rsquo;d go to class and meals. He actually promised me he would do so. Just give him time. You&rsquo;ve done it before and you can do it again,&rdquo; Lily said before she walked up the stairs to her dormitory. Sirius just watched her leave and he turned back to the table Peter was still seated at.</p><p>&ldquo;He came around last time, he&rsquo;ll surely come around again,&rdquo; Peter tried to lighten the mood, but Sirius just shrugged and shook his head.</p><p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t be so easy because he figured out that I actually wanted to be champion. He knew he almost had me back out, but part of me wished to do this,&rdquo; Sirius said and James looked at him shocked but didn&rsquo;t say anything.</p><p>&ldquo;Why would you want to be in it?&rdquo; Peter asked and gave him a shrug, because he didn&rsquo;t want to talk about it then. He really didn&rsquo;t want to talk about it at all because he had been happier when he hadn&rsquo;t known himself.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just going to go to the dorm,&rdquo; Sirius said as he took a couple steps away from the two boys and was suddenly bombarded with attention of those around him.</p><p>&ldquo;Sirius, it&rsquo;s so amazing how you became a champion!&rdquo; Emily, a sixth year, exclaimed as she threw an arm around his shoulders. He didn&rsquo;t move to wrap his arm around her and it caused her to huff. &ldquo;Come on, you&rsquo;re a man now, at least act the part.&rdquo;</p><p>When she pulled his hand up to the small of her back, he jumped away from her. It had nothing to do with the blonde girl, he knew she would make it that way, but it had to do with he couldn&rsquo;t handle anything right now. Remus had shut down when he needed him most and he really didn&rsquo;t want to deal with some sixth year girl trying to get with him.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, but I&rsquo;m just tired and still in shock from everything that just happened. I&rsquo;ll be different in the morning,&rdquo; he said and she rolled her eyes before she walked away over to a group of girls in the corner of the room.</p><p>He felt weird rejecting someone due to his current state, because usually he didn&rsquo;t care how he felt. It was just how he felt so tired and dragged down from everything that had happened to the point where he wondered if he should just go to sleep for the night.</p><p>He walked up the staircase to the dormitories and ignored all those who kept trying to talk to him even with his gloomy demeanor. Sirius knew he&rsquo;d be different in the morning because the shock would fade and he&rsquo;d feel invincible.</p><p>It was just now, as he sat alone in the dorm, he wondered why he had even done this to begin with. James reasoning really was stupid if you thought about it, but he used it as an excuse to cover the real reason he entered. It was just he hadn&rsquo;t realized he had a real reason, but Remus had realized before the other did. Maybe he&rsquo;d blame his parents for the reason he entered and it would&rsquo;ve been easy if Remus hadn&rsquo;t of entered the room.</p><p>&ldquo;Remus, are you okay?&rdquo; Sirius asked and Remus stared at him in silence before he turned around and went to leave. He stood at the door a second and let out a shaky breath.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re greedy for attention, you know that right?&rdquo; Remus asked before he left without hearing Sirius&rsquo;s answer. It wasn&rsquo;t like the other boy had an answer, because he didn&rsquo;t know he was greedy.</p><p>His entire life Sirius had spent trying to earn his family&rsquo;s attention in a positive light, but he had never considered it greedy. He thought that wanting love wasn&rsquo;t greedy, but something every human just desired. Sirius continued to stare at the door, because maybe Remus would come back and Sirius could ask if maybe the other wanted love too. He wondered if his friend would do anything to get the love he had always wanted from his own parents.</p><p>When James and Peter entered the room, Sirius stood in the middle of it as he stared at the door. His thoughts are overtaken him and he wasn&rsquo;t sure if he could even move until James touched his shoulder.</p><p>&ldquo;Did Remus come in here?&rdquo; James asked and the other nodded. &ldquo;What did he say?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He called me greedy for attention,&rdquo; he said before he went and sat down in his bed and sighed. &ldquo;Is he right? Was it greedy for attention to enter the tournament?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You never thought you&rsquo;d make it in, so it&rsquo;s not greedy,&rdquo; James tried to soothe him and Sirius looked over at him before he laughed slightly.</p><p>&ldquo;I wanted to make it in. I wanted to have a reason show my parents I can do something they can be proud of. I thought he&rsquo;d understand that,&rdquo; Sirius said before he placed his face in his hands.

James convinces Sirius into entering the tournament with the reasoning of they&rsquo;ll never be picked and maybe girls will find them heroic. Remus tells them how the idea is terrible, but his words are deemed useless once the two enter the tournament.Everything crashes down around Sirius when he&rsquo;s chosen as Hogwarts&rsquo; champion, especially when Remus shuts him out due to anger. Now Sirius has to fight to get his friend back while he also fights to stay alive in the tournament he never expected to be chosen in.</i><br /><b>Pairings:</b><i> Sirius Black/Remus Lupin &amp; James Potter/Lily Evans</i><br /><i><b>Warnings:</b>&nbsp;Swearing and violence<br /></i><i><b>Word Count:</b> 6063 words<br /></i><i><b>Notes: </b>This fic will end up being around 30k words, hope you enjoy :)<br /></i><i><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/17064083/chapters/40124303\"><b>Read on Ao3</b></a></i></p>\n<hr />\n<p>&ldquo;Welcome to Hogwarts,&rdquo; Dumbledore said as Remus looked around the room at the students from other schools.

The only curse breaker he knew of was Bill Weasley, who was in Egypt. Remus knew he could just apparate but he didn&rsquo;t know where Bill was specifically, so couldn&rsquo;t even send him an owl. Bill would be back in a few weeks, so Remus could talk to him then.</p><p>It wasn&rsquo;t like Remus could go to anyone he didn&rsquo;t know closely about his problem. What with the Potter family and those around them, including himself and Sirius, being celebrities. The scandal mongers, like that damn Skeeter woman, would have a field day with their issue. No. Remus couldn&rsquo;t do that to him or Sirius.</p><p>A tap on his shoulder snapped Remus out of his thoughts. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey,&rdquo; Tonks greeted him, sitting down next to him.</p><p>&ldquo;Tonks. Hello,&rdquo; Remus replied.</p><p>&ldquo;How are you-&rdquo; Tonks looked around. She checked no one was around before continuing &ldquo;- holding up? You doing okay?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, I&rsquo;ll be alright,&rdquo; Remus reassured her.</p><p>&ldquo;I saw the case files. It wouldn&rsquo;t take a genius to figure it out. He hasn&rsquo;t&hellip; hurt you, has he?&rdquo; Tonks enquired.</p><p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; Remus said quickly.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh Merlin, you had your&hellip; change last week too! How was that?&rdquo; Tonks asked.</p><p>&ldquo;I was on my own,&rdquo; Remus admitted, looking down as he spoke.</p><p>Tonks&rsquo; hair flickered a red before returning to its usual purple. &ldquo;You what?!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Noise level Tonks!&rdquo; Remus reminded her, glancing around.</p><p>&ldquo;Right, sorry, but really?! You were on your own?!&rdquo; Tonks'eyes were wide with horror. They went wider when Remus nodded. &ldquo;Oh Remus&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not his fault,&rdquo; Remus said quickly.</p><p>&ldquo;I know, but why couldn&rsquo;t he fight it?! Sirius is so strong-&rdquo; Tonks began.</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s trying. He makes me things, when I&rsquo;m not home. It always comes with a mess though.&rdquo; Remus felt the need to defend Sirius.</p><p>Tonks nodded, and glanced at her watch. &ldquo;I have to go. Be safe, Remus.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I will. Give Teddy my love,&rdquo; Remus replied.</p><p>They hugged goodbye and Tonks dashed away.</p><p>When Remus got home, there was tea on the table.</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you. I love you!&rdquo; He called out. That was all he could do, remind Sirius, who he knew would be in agony over his treatment of Remus, that he loved him and that he wouldn&rsquo;t ever blame him.</p><p>&ldquo;Shut up!&rdquo; Sirius yelled. That was another common occurrence, that the curse would make Sirius say awful things.</p><p>A week passed with Sirius becoming more aggressive by the day. He would yell, hit the wall, slam the door. At night, he would push Remus away, and Remus would often end up on the edge of the bed with no blanket.</p><p>&ldquo;I forgive you. I love you. I miss you,&rdquo; became the words that Remus would utter, over and over again.</p><p>Until mid way through the week, just over a week after Remus knew of the curse. </p><p>Remus guessed that Sirius had had a long day, making him too tired to fight the curse.</p><p>Sirius stormed through the door, slamming it on his way through.</p><p>&ldquo;Sirius?&rdquo; Remus called out.</p><p>Sirius stormed into the room.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m tired, make me something to eat, you lump!&rdquo; Sirius demanded. This was another new thing, that Sirius would order Remus about.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m hungry too. How does an early dinner sound?&rdquo; Remus replied. He would often be civil, just to pretend everything was alright.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care! Make me something to eat!&rdquo; Sirius yelled, slamming his hand down on the table next to Remus.</p><p>Remus went into the kitchen.</p><p>He reflected on the past week. A week where their house radiated hatred and loneliness. Two weeks without loving touches and Sirius&rsquo;s gentle kisses. Two weeks without jokes or laughing at some silly thing. </p><p>Remus didn&rsquo;t even realise he was crying until he heard Sirius storm in.</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s taking so long?&rdquo; Sirius demanded.</p><p>Remus looked up, but only just.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t just stand there sniveling! I asked you to do something!&rdquo; Sirius yelled. At this, Remus&rsquo;s lips twitched up a bit, recalling what they would call Severus in their youth.</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s so funny?&rdquo; Sirius demanded.</p><p>&ldquo;Just memories, my love, just memories,&rdquo; Remus replied.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show you memories!&rdquo; Sirius picked up a plate and stormed over.</p><p>Remus put his hands over his head, waiting for the impact.</p><p>&ldquo;NO!&rdquo; Sirius shouted suddenly. &ldquo;NO I WON&rsquo;T LET YOU HURT HIM!&rdquo; Sirius put the plate down and stumbled to the other side of the kitchen, hands over his face, his back to Remus.</p><p>&ldquo;Sirius?&rdquo; Remus said gently.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry Moony, I&rsquo;m so so sorry!&rdquo; Sirius sobbed.</p><p>&ldquo;Padfoot, my love, my stars, you know I don&rsquo;t blame you,&rdquo; Remus told him gently. Remus moved to get closer, to comfort his boyfriend.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Sirius said quickly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to hurt you. Please don&rsquo;t come closer. If you come closer it makes it harder to fight it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ok. I won&rsquo;t come closer,&rdquo; Remus assured him. </p><p>&ldquo;You should leave, Moony. Get away from here, get away from me,&rdquo; Sirius insisted.</p><p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t leave you Sirius,&rdquo; Remus said firmly.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not like I want this Remus! Merlin, I just want to hold you. I swear, when this is broken, I&rsquo;m going to make it up to you. We can take the week, at least, off of work the both of us, and just hold each other. I&rsquo;ll wait on you, hand and foot. I&rsquo;ll make it right, you&rsquo;ll see,&rdquo; Sirius rambled, his body heaving where he stood.</p><p>&ldquo;I know. You don&rsquo;t have to wait on me, but the holding each other sounds great,&rdquo; Remus replied, a smile in his voice.</p><p>&ldquo;I love you, Remus Lupin,&rdquo; Sirius said hoarsely, the effort now taking a toll on his voice.</p><p>&ldquo;I love you too, so much, Sirius Black,&rdquo; Remus reassured him gently.</p><p>&ldquo;Sorry for all the mess, with the food and the tea,&rdquo; Sirius apologised.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine. I appreciate it. Thank you for making it.&rdquo; Remus watched Sirius&rsquo;s breath become more laboured.</p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t fight it much longer,&rdquo; Sirius admitted.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s alright,&rdquo; Remus assured him.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo; There was a plea in Sirius&rsquo;s voice, one Remus recognised as Sirius&rsquo;s fear of hurting someone he loved.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s alright.&rdquo; Before Sirius could register what was happening, Remus moved quickly towards him, and pulled Sirius into his arms. He felt Sirius&rsquo;s arms around him for a second, before he was shoved away, into the cupboard, and all went black.</p><p>When Remus awoke, he was curled up in their bed, with a healing potion and chocolate next to him.</p><p>When Remus walked out into their lounge, he saw Sirius watching some muggle tv show.</p><p>&ldquo;I love you. I forgive you,&rdquo; Remus declared.</p><p>In his mind, Sirius Black sobbed.</p><p><span style=\"color: #444444\"><b>P3</b></span>:</p><p data-npf='{\"type\":\"link\",\"url\":\"https://ivyace.tumblr.com/post/181457455637/a-cursed-love-p2\",\"display_url\":\"https://ivyace.tumblr.com/post/181457455637/a-cursed-love-p2\",\"title\":\"A cursed love (P3)\",\"description\":\"This chapter will be a little different than the others.

Make me something to eat!\u201d Sirius yelled, slamming his hand down on the table next to Remus.</p><p>Remus went into the kitchen.</p><p>He reflected on the past week. A week where their house radiated hatred and loneliness. Two weeks without loving touches and Sirius\u2019s gentle kisses. Two weeks without jokes or laughing at some silly thing. </p><p>Remus didn\u2019t even realise he was crying until he heard Sirius storm in.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s taking so long?\u201d Sirius demanded.</p><p>Remus looked up, but only just.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t just stand there sniveling! I asked you to do something!\u201d Sirius yelled. At this, Remus\u2019s lips twitched up a bit, recalling what they would call Severus in their youth.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d Sirius demanded.</p><p>\u201cJust memories, my love, just memories,\u201d Remus replied.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll show you memories!\u201d Sirius picked up a plate and stormed over.</p><p>Remus put his hands over his head, waiting for the impact.</p><p>\u201cNO!\u201d Sirius shouted suddenly. \u201cNO I WON\u2019T LET YOU HURT HIM!\u201d Sirius put the plate down and stumbled to the other side of the kitchen, hands over his face, his back to Remus.</p><p>\u201cSirius?\u201d Remus said gently.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry Moony, I\u2019m so so sorry!\u201d Sirius sobbed.</p><p>\u201cPadfoot, my love, my stars, you know I don\u2019t blame you,\u201d Remus told him gently. Remus moved to get closer, to comfort his boyfriend.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d Sirius said quickly. \u201cI don\u2019t want to hurt you. Please don\u2019t come closer. If you come closer it makes it harder to fight it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOk. I won\u2019t come closer,\u201d Remus assured him. </p><p>\u201cYou should leave, Moony. Get away from here, get away from me,\u201d Sirius insisted.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t leave you Sirius,\u201d Remus said firmly.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like I want this Remus! Merlin, I just want to hold you. I swear, when this is broken, I\u2019m going to make it up to you. We can take the week, at least, off of work the both of us, and just hold each other. I\u2019ll wait on you, hand and foot. I\u2019ll make it right, you\u2019ll see,\u201d Sirius rambled, his body heaving where he stood.</p><p>\u201cI know. You don\u2019t have to wait on me, but the holding each other sounds great,\u201d Remus replied, a smile in his voice.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Remus Lupin,\u201d Sirius said hoarsely, the effort now taking a toll on his voice.</p><p>\u201cI love you too, so much, Sirius Black,\u201d Remus reassured him gently.</p><p>\u201cSorry for all the mess, with the food and the tea,\u201d Sirius apologised.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. I appreciate it. Thank you for making it.\u201d Remus watched Sirius\u2019s breath become more laboured.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t fight it much longer,\u201d Sirius admitted.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s alright,\u201d Remus assured him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d There was a plea in Sirius\u2019s voice, one Remus recognised as Sirius\u2019s fear of hurting someone he loved.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s alright.\u201d Before Sirius could register what was happening, Remus moved quickly towards him, and pulled Sirius into his arms. He felt Sirius\u2019s arms around him for a second, before he was shoved away, into the cupboard, and all went black.</p><p>When Remus awoke, he was curled up in their bed, with a healing potion and chocolate next to him.</p><p>When Remus walked out into their lounge, he saw Sirius watching some muggle tv show.</p><p>\u201cI love you.
