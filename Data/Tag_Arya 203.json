I figured 7 would be the most mentioned number in the book since there is literally a religion with gods called \u201cthe Seven\u201d but 7 only comes up 727 times while 3 comes up 1514 times in all the books\u2026</p>",
                "content": "<p>I was doing research for a meta and realized it comes up an oddly numerous (haha get it?) amount of times while she is Braavos.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;<i>His father was shouting orders. Sailors scrambled up and down the <b>three</b> <b>tall masts</b> and moved along the rigging, reefing the heavy purple sails. Below, oarsmen heaved and strained over two great banks of oars. The decks tilted, creaking, as the galleas Titan&rsquo;s Daughter heeled to starboard and began to come about.</i>&rdquo; - Arya I, AFfC<br /></p><p>&ldquo;<i>Maester Luwin had taught them about Braavos, but Arya had forgotten much of what he&rsquo;d said. It was a flat city, she could see that even from afar, not like King&rsquo;s Landing on its <b>three high hills</b>. The only hills here were the ones that men had raised of brick and granite, bronze and marble. Something else was missing as well, though it took her a few moments to realize what it was</i>.&rdquo; - Arya I, AFfC<br /></p><p>&ldquo;<i>She saw huge flat-bottomed barges too, heaped high with crates and barrels and pushed along by twenty polemen to a side, and fancy floating houses with lanterns of colored glass, velvet drapes, and brazen figureheads. Off in the far distance, looming above canals and houses both, was a massive grey stone roadway of some kind, supported by <b>three tiers of mighty arches</b> marching away south into the haze</i>.&rdquo; - Arya I, AFfC<br /></p><p>&ldquo;<i>I know,&ldquo; said Arya. Jaqen H'ghar had granted <b>three</b> <b>of her prayers</b> once. All I had to do was whisper &hellip;</i>&rdquo; - Arya II, AFfC<br /></p><p>&ldquo;<i>He never told her his name. Neither did the waif, the little girl with the big eyes and hollow face who reminded her of another little girl, named Weasel. Like Arya, the waif lived below the temple, along with <b>three</b> <b>acolytes</b>, two serving men, and a cook called Umma. Umma liked to talk as she worked, but Arya could not understand a word she said</i>.&rdquo; - Arya II, AFfC<br /></p><p>&ldquo;<i>The stern face never smiled; his eyes were pale, his lips full and dark. The handsome man had a beard of a different color every time she saw him, and a different nose, but he was never less than comely. <b>Those three came most often, but there were others: the squinter, the lordling, the starved man</b>. One time the fat fellow and the squinter came together. Umma sent Arya to pour for them. \"When you are not pouring, you must stand as still as if you had been carved of stone,&rdquo; the kindly man told her. &ldquo;Can you do that?</i>&rdquo; - Arya II, AFfC<br /></p><p>&ldquo;<i>By the time the <b>three</b> <b>of them</b> climbed down the ladder from the room beneath the eaves, Brusco and his sons were out in the boat on the little canal behind the house. Brusco barked at the girls to hurry, as he did every morning</i>.&rdquo; <br />- Cat of the Canals, AFfC<br /></p><p>&ldquo;<i>After that, she had nothing to do but sit and yawn for a long while as Brusco and his sons pushed them through the predawn gloom, wending down a confusion of small canals. The day looked to be a rare one, crisp and clear and bright. <b>Braavos only had three kinds of weather</b>; fog was bad, rain was worse, and freezing rain was worst.</i>&rdquo; - Cat of the Canals, AFfC<br /></p><p>&ldquo;<i>Learn <b>three</b> <b>new things</b> before you come back to us,&ldquo; the kindly man had commanded Cat, when he sent her forth into the city. She always did. Sometimes it was no more than <b>three</b> new words of the Braavosi tongue. Sometimes she brought back sailor&rsquo;s tales, of strange and wondrous happenings from the wide wet world beyond the isles of Braavos, wars and rains of toads and dragons hatching. Sometimes she learned <b>three</b> new japes or <b>three</b> new riddles, or tricks of this trade or the other. And every so often, she would learn some secret.</i>&rdquo; - Cat of the Canals, AFfC<br /></p><p>&ldquo;<i>All men must serve.&rdquo; And so she did, <b>three</b> <b>days of every thirty</b>. When the moon was black she was no one, a servant of the Many-Faced God in a robe of black and white. She walked beside the kindly man through the fragrant darkness, carrying her iron lantern</i>.&rdquo; - Cat of Canals, AFfC<br /></p><p>Guys&hellip;this goes on for a while. I dont have the patience to do all of them, I&rsquo;m not going to lie. It comes up again and again and again. Three three three. And i went back to look, it&rsquo;s not just in Braavos. 147 times there are three somethings in Arya&rsquo;s chapters. Dany mentions it 188 and Tyrion mentions it 183 and Jon mentions it 177 , so i thought it might be a Key Five thing&hellip;but it doesnt seem like it since Bran only mentions it 84 times and i checked Sansa for fun and she mentions it 82 times.&nbsp;</p><p>So hey, George, what up with you and the number 3? I figured 7 would be the most mentioned number in the book since there is literally a religion with gods called &ldquo;the Seven&rdquo; but 7 only comes up 727 times while 3 comes up 1514 times in all the books&hellip;</p>",

On top of that she has other skills than fighting (something only like kinda okay at if she has the element of surprise). She&rsquo;s skilled at:</p><p>Math:<br />&ldquo;<i>Ashore. Arya bit her lip. She had crossed the narrow sea to get here, but if the captain had asked she would have told him she wanted to stay aboard the Titan&rsquo;s Daughter. Salty was too small to man an oar, she knew that now, but she could learn to splice ropes and reef the sails and steer a course across the great salt seas. Denyo had taken her up to the crow&rsquo;s nest once, and she hadn&rsquo;t been afraid at all, though the deck had seemed a tiny thing below her.<b> I can do sums</b> too, and keep a cabin neat.</i>&rdquo;- Arya I, AFfC</p><p>Riding (and math again):<br />&ldquo;<i>Arya took after their lord father. Her hair was a lusterless brown, and her face was long and solemn. Jeyne used to call her Arya Horseface, and neigh whenever she came near. <b>It hurt that the one thing Arya could do better than her sister was ride a horse. Well, that and manage a household</b>. Sansa had never had much of a head for figures. If she did marry Prince Joff, Arya hoped for his sake that he had a good steward.</i>&rdquo; - Arya I, AGoT</p><p>Language:<br />\n\n&ldquo;<b>Supper was for language lessons</b>. The blind girl<b> understood Braavosi and could speak it passably</b>, she had even lost most of her barbaric accent, but the kindly man was not content. He was insisting that she<b> improve her High Valyrian </b>and l<b>earn the tongues of Lys and Pentos</b> too.&rdquo; - The Blind Girl, ADwD<br /></p><p>Cooking (not super important, but its true):<br />&ldquo;<i>She got along well enough with the cook. <b>Umma would slap a knife into her hand and point at an onion, and Arya would chop it</b>.<b> Umma would shove her toward a mound of dough, and Arya would knead it until the cook said stop (stop was the first Braavosi word she learned)</b>.<b> Umma would hand her a fish, and Arya would bone it and fillet it and roll it in the nuts the cook was crushing</b>. The brackish waters that surrounded Braavos teemed with fish and shellfish of every sort, the kindly man explained.</i>&rdquo; - Arya II, AFfC<br /></p><p>Being observant/low-key espionage:<br />\n\n&ldquo;<i><b>Learn three new things before you come back to us</b>,&rdquo; the kindly man had commanded Cat, when he sent her forth into the city. She always did. Sometimes it was no more than three new words of the Braavosi tongue. Sometimes she brought back sailor&rsquo;s tales, of strange and wondrous happenings from the wide wet world beyond the isles of Braavos, wars and rains of toads and dragons hatching. Sometimes she learned three new japes or three new riddles, or tricks of this trade or the other. <b>And every so often, she would learn some secret</b></i>.&rdquo; - Cat of the Canals, AFfC&nbsp;</p><p>I think that being Queensguard is a lazy easy end for Arya. Basically just throw away all she has learned except for fighting and the being observant thing and call it a day. When looking at her end-game i like to look back to the beginning:</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Arya cocked her head to one side. <b>&ldquo;Can I be a king&rsquo;s councillor and build castles and become the High</b> <b>Septon</b></i>?&rdquo; - Eddard V, AGoT<br /></p>",
