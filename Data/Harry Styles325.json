Packing had never been her strong point. It\u2019s one of the\nmain reasons she\u2019d avoided travel for so long. The furthest she\u2019d ever\ntraveled was Brighton and she\u2019d never been on a plane. She didn\u2019t know what\nshe needed to take with her to go on tour with one of the world\u2019s biggest pop\nstars. Would she need fancy outfits? Lounge wear? Casual outfits? She had no\nidea what she would be spending most of her time doing, or if she would be able\nto do laundry. One of everything is what she decided to go with, something for\nevery occasion and enough underwear for the whole trip so that if she wasn\u2019t\nable to do laundry, she wouldn\u2019t have to run out to the store for clean pants.\nShe sighed deeply worried that she wouldn\u2019t have what she needed but started\npacking it all into her bag anyway.</p><p>Half an hour later\nher suitcase was so full it wouldn\u2019t close and she slumped down onto her couch and\nregretted leaving the packing so late. Her flight left tomorrow morning at 7am\nand she hadn\u2019t even thought about packing her toiletries yet. </p><p>This is usually the\npoint where she would have given in and called Ronnie for help but things had\nbeen weird since Anna agreed to going away with Harry. They\u2019d barely spoken,\naside from the occasional text that let them know the other was still alive,\nthey didn\u2019t hang out, they didn\u2019t keep each other updated on their lives, Anna\ndidn\u2019t know where she stood with him now and that hurt. This had never happened\nbefore, the longest they\u2019d gone without speaking was probably 4 days a few\nyears ago when Ronnie went on holidays and had no phone service. As hard as she\ntried not to let it get to her, he didn\u2019t really know how to exist without him\nin her life, but she knew exactly what his problem was and that was what was\nbothering her the most. </p><p>*** </p><p>The alarm sounded in\nAnna\u2019s ear at 3:12am exactly and in that moment, she couldn\u2019t think of one\nlogical reason to get out of bed. What was the point in getting a first class\nflight if she still had to be awake at this ungodly hour? Of course she was\ngrateful that Harry had bought her ticket and arranged everything and she\nwanted to kick herself for being so bratty but it was early and she couldn\u2019t\nhelp it. She rolled over and switched off the blaring alarm which continued to\nring in her ears as she took her covers off and adjusted to the morning air.</p><p>Much to her surprise,\nshe had managed to get most of her packing done last night, all she had to do\nnow was get dressed, schedule her blog post, pack her laptop , clean her teeth,\npack her toothbrush, braid her hair and be out the door by 3:40. She checked\nher phone again. 3:20. She better get a move on.</p><p><b><i>Anna\u2019s 2018 Travel playlist</i></b></p><p><i>Last week I booked a spur of the moment trip to the US and I leave\nMonday so I thought I\u2019d share with you all the playlist I\u2019ll be listening to on\nthe plane. It\u2019s a trip I\u2019ve always dreamed about doing but between uni and\nother commitments I never had the time or the money, but now that I\u2019m done with\nuni and I\u2019ve had a few months to get this professional blogging thing on the\ngo, I thought I might as well and what could be more fun than taking you all\nalong with me? I\u2019ve never done this whole travel blogging thing before so don\u2019t\nexpect daily posts especially while I\u2019m dealing with jetlag.

It was all straight forward and she was thankful for that. </p><p>\u201cMiss Elliot\u201d One of\nthe flight attendants approched her as everyone was getting ready to get off\nthe plane </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s me\u201d Anna\nreplied shyly. </p><p>\u201cMr Styles has\narranged to meet you on the runway to avoid a commotion, so when you get off\nthe plane head straight for the security car, all of your luggage has already\nbeen taken there\u201d </p><p>Anna nodded and\nthanked her while she continued to pack her things away. She guessed that this\nwas part of the reason she had landed in New York first, so that she didn\u2019t\nhave to go through all the hassle of customs when she could be spending time\nwith Harry. She fixed her hair and makeup quickly and waited for the flight\nattendants to start ushering people off the plane. </p><p>The hot air washed\nover her as she stepped outside onto the tarmac, she knew it was going to be\nhot, but this is not what she had expected, the air was dry and the heat hit\nher like a wave. There was a black range rover sitting on the edge of the\ntarmac almost right next to the door that would lead the rest of the passengers\ninto the airport. As she made her way over to it it seemed obvious to her that\nHarry was waiting in there but she wondered if any of the other passengers\nguessed that someone as famous as him was sitting there or if it looked\ncompletely normal to them. </p><p>Anna reached the car\nand wrapped her fingers around the handle to the back door, taking a deep\nbreath as pulled it open. </p><p>\u201cAnna!\u201d Harry\nexclaimed, taking her hand and helping her into the car and kissing it as she\nsat down \u201cLong time no see.\u201d His smile was wide and Anna couldn\u2019t help but\nblush. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s only been two\nweeks\u201d she giggled </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a long time\u201d\nHe nodded his head sarcastically. </p><p>\u201cI guess it is\u201d she\nleant up and kissed his cheek </p><p>\u201cHow was the flight?\u201d\nhe asked moving slightly so that Anna could do her seatbelt up </p><p>\u201cI need a shower and\nsome moisturizer\u201d She laughed. </p><p>The car began to pull\naway from the tarmac </p><p>\u201cI figured you would.\nWe\u2019re going straight back to the hotel and we can go exploring later\u201d </p><p>\u201cThank you\u201d </p><p>\u201cI uh\u201d Harry shifted\nin his seat feeling a little nervous \u201cI got you your own room, I wanted you to\nbe comfortable, but you\u2019re more than welcome to stay with me\u201d </p><p>Anna was secretly\npleased about this. She liked Harry a lot more than she cared to admit, but\nthey\u2019d been on two dates and if they were going to be living in each other&rsquo;s\npockets for the next few months, she was glad she would have her own space when\nshe needed it. </p><p>\u201cThanks\u201d she nodded\n\u201cI\u2019ll visit a lot\u201d</p><p>He smiled and\ninterlocked his fingers with hers \u201cI\u2019d like that\u201d </p><p>When they arrived at\nthe hotel, Harry took Anna\u2019s bags from the back of the car and showed her to\nher room, which was right next door to his. It was bigger than she expected,\nwith it a separate living room and bedroom as well as a small kitchen area, </p><p>\u201cWow\u201d she sighed as\nshe looked around \u201cIt\u2019s big\u201d</p><p>Harry giggled and\nAnna glared at him before smile spread across her face \u201cGet your mind out of\nthe gutter\u201d </p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t help it love\u201d\nhe smirked, flashing his dimples. </p><p>She took her hands\nand placed them on his chest pushing him backwards towards the door \u201cI need to\nshower, \u00a0I\u2019ll see you later\u201d </p><p>\u201cDo I get a kiss\nfirst?\u201d </p><p>Anna stood staring at\nhim for a moment considering his request and then she stood on her toes and\npecked his lips gently. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll kiss you\nproperly once I\u2019ve cleaned my teeth\u201d </p><p>\u201cI appreciate that\u201d\nhe laughed and gentley pecked her forehead before he turned and walked out of\nthe room. </p><p>*** </p><p>Harry was getting\nready to go onstage for his first show of the American Tour and while Anna had\nbeen spending time with him backstage it was time for her to let him get ready.\n</p><p>\u201cYou can stay\u201d he\nsaid holding onto her hand as she tried to leave his dressing room. </p><p>\u201cYou have a show to\nput on\u201d she giggled and kissed his forehead \u201cI\u2019ll still be here when it\u2019s over\u201d\n</p><p>\u201cGood\u201d he smiled and\nlet go of her hand \u201cstay up the front please\u201d </p><p>\u201cOf course\u201d she said\nas she turned to walk away.</p><p>The hallways of the\nvenue were chaotic. There were crew members everywhere, shouting commands to\nmake sure that everything was ready to go. Anna weaved her way through them,\nbeing careful not to disturb them as she made her way to the back exit of the\nvenue. Herself and Harry were doing their best to keep things quiet so that his\nfans didn\u2019t find out before they were ready for them to know. Anna had a ticket\nto get into the venue the same way the fans did, she didn&rsquo;t have a treat people\nwith kindness sticker like Harry\u2019s other guests, but the whole crew and the\nvenue security knew who she was. She blended into the crowd as she walked past\nthe merch stand and into the front entrance where she walked quickly to the\ndoor on her ticket and into the arena. She couldn\u2019t get close to the front, the\nfans had lined the barrier and beyond, all excited for Harry to come on stage,\nso she remained at the back of the pit making sure she didn\u2019t disturb anyone,\nand hoped that he\u2019d be able to see her anyway. The pre-show playlist was\nechoing through the room and Anna watched as everyone around her sang along to\nOlivia by One Direction. </p><p>\u201cAnna?\u201d she felt a\nhand on her shoulder and turned around to see a dark haired woman in her late\nforties standing behind her. </p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d she smiled,\nwondering why she had been recognised all the way in Dallas Texas, she was sure\nher \u00a0blog didn\u2019t reach that far, although this woman\u2019s accent didn\u2019t sound\nAmerican. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Anne\u201d she held\nher hand out to shake Anna\u2019s \u201cHarry\u2019s Mum\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Anna said\nshaking her head and feeling a little stupid she knew that Anne was here but\nshe didn\u2019t know that Anne knew that she was here \u00a0\u201cHi, sorry, I didn\u2019t\nexpect to meet you tonight\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo sorry love it\u2019s\nmy fault, I shouldn\u2019t have snuck up behind you like that, I just had to meet\nthe girl my son hasn\u2019t shut up about for the last few months\u201d </p><p>Anna blushed \u201cHe\u2019s a\ngood guy, very gentlemanly, you did a wonderful job raising him\u201d </p><p>\u201cHe made it easy\u201d she\nsmiled \u201cSo I hear you write a blog, what do you write about\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever comes to\nmind, I post daily so sometimes I struggle to think of things, but that\u2019s part\nof the fun\u201d Anna admitted, curious about what Harry had said to her. </p><p>\u201cAnd you met him in\nLondon? At his show?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah\u201d Anna nodded\n\u201cMy friend, Ronnie, works for the O2 so he took me along and had me \u2018help\u2019\u201d she\nsaid using air quotes \u201cwith photography\u201d </p><p>Anne smiled \u201cWhat are\nfriends for?\u201d </p><p>Anna\u2019s heart sank a\nlittle, thinking about how much she missed Ronnie. \u201cYou must be incredibly\nproud\u201d Anna gestured around the room at the crowd that was now filling the\narena getting more and more excited with the end of each song on the playlist. </p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a mother&rsquo;s\ndream\u201d Anne nodded. </p><p>They stood together\nfor a while, getting to know each other, and Anna appreciated the effort Anne\nwas making to make her feel welcome, but it dawned on her that most of Harry\u2019s\nfans would recognise Anne and would be curious as to why she was talking to\nAnna and a handful of them would remember that she was at the London show, and\nthey might put two and two together. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry Anne,\u201d she\nsaid sympathetically \u201cHarry and I don\u2019t really know what this whole thing is\nyet, and we don\u2019t want people getting wind of it, if they see me with you they\nmight work it out\u201d </p><p>Anne nodded \u201cI\nunderstand love, we\u2019ll catch up backstage.\u201d </p><p>The show was about to\nstart, Harry would be standing on the stage by now, waiting for the screens to\nrise and Anna could feel his nerves for him, but she could also feel a pounding\nache in her head and she wished that she hadn\u2019t left her bag backstage. She\nrubbed her temples and tried to shake it off but the loud opening of Only Angel\nonly made it worse. She looked up at the stage and the lights made her eyes\nblur and she knew that she was getting a migraine. It had been years since she\u2019d\nhad one, she would have been about 18 the last time and she hoped to god this\none wouldn&rsquo;t be as bad. </p><p>Harry could see Anna\nfrom where he was standing on stage, and although there was hundreds of people\naround her, he thought she looked at little pale. He was midway through\nStockholm Syndrome but he had to make sure she was ok. </p><p>\u201cStop stop stop\u201d he\ncalled to the band and the music ceased. He pulled the mic off it\u2019s stand and\nwalked closer to where Anna was standing. </p><p>\u201cAre you ok up the\nback there?\u201d </p><p>The crowd around her\nscreamed which only made her headache worse. She knew he was talking about her,\nbut she thought for the sake of keeping it quiet, she tried to play dumb. </p><p>He caught on and\nfollowed in her footsteps \u201cYou, with the blonde hair and the lovely white\nblouse, are you alright, you look a bit ill\u201d </p><p>People turned around\nand pointed to her and she gave in. \u201cI\u2019m Ok\u201d she called holding her thumbs up\nin case he couldn\u2019t hear her</p><p>\u201cYou good? Need\nanything? Water maybe?\u201d </p><p>She nodded and\nwatched as Harry signalled a security guard that was standing near her and\nthrew one of his water bottles to him. </p><p>\u201cCould you give that\nto her please?\u201d </p><p>The water made its\nway to her and knowing who she was, the security guard stayed by her, making\nsure she was ok. </p><p>Anna stuck it out for\na few more songs, but by the time Harry was making his way to the b-stage she\ncouldn\u2019t wait any longer. She told the guard she had to go backstage and she\nrushed out of the room while Harry couldn\u2019t see. She didn\u2019t know how to get to\nHarry\u2019s dressing room from inside the venue, so the guard went with her and at\nthis point she didn\u2019t care if people started to work something out, she was\nsure they would be paying more attention to Harry anyway and she needed to take\nsome ibuprofen. </p><p>When she got to the\ndressing room she found her purse, pulled out her painkillers, and turned the\nlights out wishing her head would stop pounding.</p><p>She must have fallen\nasleep because the next thing she knew, she \u00a0woke up to Harry sitting next\nto her on the couch with his hand resting gently on her back. </p><p>\u201cAnna\u201d he whispered\nas her eyes blinked open \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d </p><p>She blinked a few\ntimes, adjusting to being awake again \u201cI got a migraine.\u201d </p><p>Her voice was soft\nand barely audible but Harry nodded and began rubbing circles around her back\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t look good out there, is there anything I can do?\u201d </p><p>\u201cCuddle me\u201d she\nwhispered.</p><hr><p>Big shout out to <a>@lovesmelikebrandnewstarlight</a>\u200b for talking through things with me and helping with the editing.

It was all straight forward and she was thankful for that. </p><p>\u201cMiss Elliot\u201d One of\nthe flight attendants approched her as everyone was getting ready to get off\nthe plane </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s me\u201d Anna\nreplied shyly. </p><p>\u201cMr Styles has\narranged to meet you on the runway to avoid a commotion, so when you get off\nthe plane head straight for the security car, all of your luggage has already\nbeen taken there\u201d </p><p>Anna nodded and\nthanked her while she continued to pack her things away. She guessed that this\nwas part of the reason she had landed in New York first, so that she didn\u2019t\nhave to go through all the hassle of customs when she could be spending time\nwith Harry. She fixed her hair and makeup quickly and waited for the flight\nattendants to start ushering people off the plane. </p><p>The hot air washed\nover her as she stepped outside onto the tarmac, she knew it was going to be\nhot, but this is not what she had expected, the air was dry and the heat hit\nher like a wave. There was a black range rover sitting on the edge of the\ntarmac almost right next to the door that would lead the rest of the passengers\ninto the airport. As she made her way over to it it seemed obvious to her that\nHarry was waiting in there but she wondered if any of the other passengers\nguessed that someone as famous as him was sitting there or if it looked\ncompletely normal to them. </p><p>Anna reached the car\nand wrapped her fingers around the handle to the back door, taking a deep\nbreath as pulled it open. </p><p>\u201cAnna!\u201d Harry\nexclaimed, taking her hand and helping her into the car and kissing it as she\nsat down \u201cLong time no see.\u201d His smile was wide and Anna couldn\u2019t help but\nblush. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s only been two\nweeks\u201d she giggled </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a long time\u201d\nHe nodded his head sarcastically. </p><p>\u201cI guess it is\u201d she\nleant up and kissed his cheek </p><p>\u201cHow was the flight?\u201d\nhe asked moving slightly so that Anna could do her seatbelt up </p><p>\u201cI need a shower and\nsome moisturizer\u201d She laughed. </p><p>The car began to pull\naway from the tarmac </p><p>\u201cI figured you would.\nWe\u2019re going straight back to the hotel and we can go exploring later\u201d </p><p>\u201cThank you\u201d </p><p>\u201cI uh\u201d Harry shifted\nin his seat feeling a little nervous \u201cI got you your own room, I wanted you to\nbe comfortable, but you\u2019re more than welcome to stay with me\u201d </p><p>Anna was secretly\npleased about this. She liked Harry a lot more than she cared to admit, but\nthey\u2019d been on two dates and if they were going to be living in each other\u2019s\npockets for the next few months, she was glad she would have her own space when\nshe needed it. </p><p>\u201cThanks\u201d she nodded\n\u201cI\u2019ll visit a lot\u201d</p><p>He smiled and\ninterlocked his fingers with hers \u201cI\u2019d like that\u201d </p><p>When they arrived at\nthe hotel, Harry took Anna\u2019s bags from the back of the car and showed her to\nher room, which was right next door to his. It was bigger than she expected,\nwith it a separate living room and bedroom as well as a small kitchen area, </p><p>\u201cWow\u201d she sighed as\nshe looked around \u201cIt\u2019s big\u201d</p><p>Harry giggled and\nAnna glared at him before smile spread across her face \u201cGet your mind out of\nthe gutter\u201d </p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t help it love\u201d\nhe smirked, flashing his dimples. </p><p>She took her hands\nand placed them on his chest pushing him backwards towards the door \u201cI need to\nshower, \u00a0I\u2019ll see you later\u201d </p><p>\u201cDo I get a kiss\nfirst?\u201d </p><p>Anna stood staring at\nhim for a moment considering his request and then she stood on her toes and\npecked his lips gently. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll kiss you\nproperly once I\u2019ve cleaned my teeth\u201d </p><p>\u201cI appreciate that\u201d\nhe laughed and gentley pecked her forehead before he turned and walked out of\nthe room. </p><p>*** </p><p>Harry was getting\nready to go onstage for his first show of the American Tour and while Anna had\nbeen spending time with him backstage it was time for her to let him get ready.\n</p><p>\u201cYou can stay\u201d he\nsaid holding onto her hand as she tried to leave his dressing room. </p><p>\u201cYou have a show to\nput on\u201d she giggled and kissed his forehead \u201cI\u2019ll still be here when it\u2019s over\u201d\n</p><p>\u201cGood\u201d he smiled and\nlet go of her hand \u201cstay up the front please\u201d </p><p>\u201cOf course\u201d she said\nas she turned to walk away.</p><p>The hallways of the\nvenue were chaotic. There were crew members everywhere, shouting commands to\nmake sure that everything was ready to go. Anna weaved her way through them,\nbeing careful not to disturb them as she made her way to the back exit of the\nvenue. Herself and Harry were doing their best to keep things quiet so that his\nfans didn\u2019t find out before they were ready for them to know. Anna had a ticket\nto get into the venue the same way the fans did, she didn\u2019t have a treat people\nwith kindness sticker like Harry\u2019s other guests, but the whole crew and the\nvenue security knew who she was. She blended into the crowd as she walked past\nthe merch stand and into the front entrance where she walked quickly to the\ndoor on her ticket and into the arena. She couldn\u2019t get close to the front, the\nfans had lined the barrier and beyond, all excited for Harry to come on stage,\nso she remained at the back of the pit making sure she didn\u2019t disturb anyone,\nand hoped that he\u2019d be able to see her anyway. The pre-show playlist was\nechoing through the room and Anna watched as everyone around her sang along to\nOlivia by One Direction. </p><p>\u201cAnna?\u201d she felt a\nhand on her shoulder and turned around to see a dark haired woman in her late\nforties standing behind her. </p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d she smiled,\nwondering why she had been recognised all the way in Dallas Texas, she was sure\nher \u00a0blog didn\u2019t reach that far, although this woman\u2019s accent didn\u2019t sound\nAmerican. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Anne\u201d she held\nher hand out to shake Anna\u2019s \u201cHarry\u2019s Mum\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Anna said\nshaking her head and feeling a little stupid she knew that Anne was here but\nshe didn\u2019t know that Anne knew that she was here \u00a0\u201cHi, sorry, I didn\u2019t\nexpect to meet you tonight\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo sorry love it\u2019s\nmy fault, I shouldn\u2019t have snuck up behind you like that, I just had to meet\nthe girl my son hasn\u2019t shut up about for the last few months\u201d </p><p>Anna blushed \u201cHe\u2019s a\ngood guy, very gentlemanly, you did a wonderful job raising him\u201d </p><p>\u201cHe made it easy\u201d she\nsmiled \u201cSo I hear you write a blog, what do you write about\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever comes to\nmind, I post daily so sometimes I struggle to think of things, but that\u2019s part\nof the fun\u201d Anna admitted, curious about what Harry had said to her. </p><p>\u201cAnd you met him in\nLondon? At his show?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah\u201d Anna nodded\n\u201cMy friend, Ronnie, works for the O2 so he took me along and had me \u2018help\u2019\u201d she\nsaid using air quotes \u201cwith photography\u201d </p><p>Anne smiled \u201cWhat are\nfriends for?\u201d </p><p>Anna\u2019s heart sank a\nlittle, thinking about how much she missed Ronnie. \u201cYou must be incredibly\nproud\u201d Anna gestured around the room at the crowd that was now filling the\narena getting more and more excited with the end of each song on the playlist. </p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a mother\u2019s\ndream\u201d Anne nodded. </p><p>They stood together\nfor a while, getting to know each other, and Anna appreciated the effort Anne\nwas making to make her feel welcome, but it dawned on her that most of Harry\u2019s\nfans would recognise Anne and would be curious as to why she was talking to\nAnna and a handful of them would remember that she was at the London show, and\nthey might put two and two together. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry Anne,\u201d she\nsaid sympathetically \u201cHarry and I don\u2019t really know what this whole thing is\nyet, and we don\u2019t want people getting wind of it, if they see me with you they\nmight work it out\u201d </p><p>Anne nodded \u201cI\nunderstand love, we\u2019ll catch up backstage.\u201d </p><p>The show was about to\nstart, Harry would be standing on the stage by now, waiting for the screens to\nrise and Anna could feel his nerves for him, but she could also feel a pounding\nache in her head and she wished that she hadn\u2019t left her bag backstage. She\nrubbed her temples and tried to shake it off but the loud opening of Only Angel\nonly made it worse. She looked up at the stage and the lights made her eyes\nblur and she knew that she was getting a migraine. It had been years since she\u2019d\nhad one, she would have been about 18 the last time and she hoped to god this\none wouldn\u2019t be as bad. </p><p>Harry could see Anna\nfrom where he was standing on stage, and although there was hundreds of people\naround her, he thought she looked at little pale. He was midway through\nStockholm Syndrome but he had to make sure she was ok. </p><p>\u201cStop stop stop\u201d he\ncalled to the band and the music ceased. He pulled the mic off it\u2019s stand and\nwalked closer to where Anna was standing. </p><p>\u201cAre you ok up the\nback there?\u201d </p><p>The crowd around her\nscreamed which only made her headache worse. She knew he was talking about her,\nbut she thought for the sake of keeping it quiet, she tried to play dumb. </p><p>He caught on and\nfollowed in her footsteps \u201cYou, with the blonde hair and the lovely white\nblouse, are you alright, you look a bit ill\u201d </p><p>People turned around\nand pointed to her and she gave in. \u201cI\u2019m Ok\u201d she called holding her thumbs up\nin case he couldn\u2019t hear her</p><p>\u201cYou good? Need\nanything? Water maybe?\u201d </p><p>She nodded and\nwatched as Harry signalled a security guard that was standing near her and\nthrew one of his water bottles to him. </p><p>\u201cCould you give that\nto her please?\u201d </p><p>The water made its\nway to her and knowing who she was, the security guard stayed by her, making\nsure she was ok. </p><p>Anna stuck it out for\na few more songs, but by the time Harry was making his way to the b-stage she\ncouldn\u2019t wait any longer. She told the guard she had to go backstage and she\nrushed out of the room while Harry couldn\u2019t see. She didn\u2019t know how to get to\nHarry\u2019s dressing room from inside the venue, so the guard went with her and at\nthis point she didn\u2019t care if people started to work something out, she was\nsure they would be paying more attention to Harry anyway and she needed to take\nsome ibuprofen. </p><p>When she got to the\ndressing room she found her purse, pulled out her painkillers, and turned the\nlights out wishing her head would stop pounding.</p><p>She must have fallen\nasleep because the next thing she knew, she \u00a0woke up to Harry sitting next\nto her on the couch with his hand resting gently on her back. </p><p>\u201cAnna\u201d he whispered\nas her eyes blinked open \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d </p><p>She blinked a few\ntimes, adjusting to being awake again \u201cI got a migraine.\u201d </p><p>Her voice was soft\nand barely audible but Harry nodded and began rubbing circles around her back\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t look good out there, is there anything I can do?\u201d </p><p>\u201cCuddle me\u201d she\nwhispered.</p><hr><p>Big shout out to <a>@lovesmelikebrandnewstarlight</a>\u200b for talking through things with me and helping with the editing. She\u2019s an angel. AND she made Anna\u2019s playlist on spotify so if you want to check it out you can find it <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/user/hannahwildflower/playlist/5Dve8rl0uHa9Wk9BeLXOou?si=BI-2JuDNQEK20I8527_CvA\">here</a>\u00a0</p><p><a href=\"http://all-the-love-harold.tumblr.com/ask\">Let me know what you thought of this chapter or what you think might happen next. </a>I\u2019m also going to write some blurbs and concepts about this series so if you have requests send them through\u00a0</p><p>Thank you so much for reading, it means the world to me xxxx\u00a0</p></p>",

Packing had never been her strong point. It\u2019s one of the\nmain reasons she\u2019d avoided travel for so long. The furthest she\u2019d ever\ntraveled was Brighton and she\u2019d never been on a plane. She didn\u2019t know what\nshe needed to take with her to go on tour with one of the world\u2019s biggest pop\nstars. Would she need fancy outfits? Lounge wear? Casual outfits? She had no\nidea what she would be spending most of her time doing, or if she would be able\nto do laundry. One of everything is what she decided to go with, something for\nevery occasion and enough underwear for the whole trip so that if she wasn\u2019t\nable to do laundry, she wouldn\u2019t have to run out to the store for clean pants.\nShe sighed deeply worried that she wouldn\u2019t have what she needed but started\npacking it all into her bag anyway.</p><p>Half an hour later\nher suitcase was so full it wouldn\u2019t close and she slumped down onto her couch and\nregretted leaving the packing so late. Her flight left tomorrow morning at 7am\nand she hadn\u2019t even thought about packing her toiletries yet. </p><p>This is usually the\npoint where she would have given in and called Ronnie for help but things had\nbeen weird since Anna agreed to going away with Harry. They\u2019d barely spoken,\naside from the occasional text that let them know the other was still alive,\nthey didn\u2019t hang out, they didn\u2019t keep each other updated on their lives, Anna\ndidn\u2019t know where she stood with him now and that hurt. This had never happened\nbefore, the longest they\u2019d gone without speaking was probably 4 days a few\nyears ago when Ronnie went on holidays and had no phone service. As hard as she\ntried not to let it get to her, he didn\u2019t really know how to exist without him\nin her life, but she knew exactly what his problem was and that was what was\nbothering her the most. </p><p>*** </p><p>The alarm sounded in\nAnna\u2019s ear at 3:12am exactly and in that moment, she couldn\u2019t think of one\nlogical reason to get out of bed. What was the point in getting a first class\nflight if she still had to be awake at this ungodly hour? Of course she was\ngrateful that Harry had bought her ticket and arranged everything and she\nwanted to kick herself for being so bratty but it was early and she couldn\u2019t\nhelp it. She rolled over and switched off the blaring alarm which continued to\nring in her ears as she took her covers off and adjusted to the morning air.</p><p>Much to her surprise,\nshe had managed to get most of her packing done last night, all she had to do\nnow was get dressed, schedule her blog post, pack her laptop , clean her teeth,\npack her toothbrush, braid her hair and be out the door by 3:40. She checked\nher phone again. 3:20. She better get a move on.</p><p><b><i>Anna\u2019s 2018 Travel playlist</i></b></p><p><i>Last week I booked a spur of the moment trip to the US and I leave\nMonday so I thought I\u2019d share with you all the playlist I\u2019ll be listening to on\nthe plane. It\u2019s a trip I\u2019ve always dreamed about doing but between uni and\nother commitments I never had the time or the money, but now that I\u2019m done with\nuni and I\u2019ve had a few months to get this professional blogging thing on the\ngo, I thought I might as well and what could be more fun than taking you all\nalong with me? I\u2019ve never done this whole travel blogging thing before so don\u2019t\nexpect daily posts especially while I\u2019m dealing with jetlag.

It was all straight forward and she was thankful for that. </p><p>\u201cMiss Elliot\u201d One of\nthe flight attendants approched her as everyone was getting ready to get off\nthe plane </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s me\u201d Anna\nreplied shyly. </p><p>\u201cMr Styles has\narranged to meet you on the runway to avoid a commotion, so when you get off\nthe plane head straight for the security car, all of your luggage has already\nbeen taken there\u201d </p><p>Anna nodded and\nthanked her while she continued to pack her things away. She guessed that this\nwas part of the reason she had landed in New York first, so that she didn\u2019t\nhave to go through all the hassle of customs when she could be spending time\nwith Harry. She fixed her hair and makeup quickly and waited for the flight\nattendants to start ushering people off the plane. </p><p>The hot air washed\nover her as she stepped outside onto the tarmac, she knew it was going to be\nhot, but this is not what she had expected, the air was dry and the heat hit\nher like a wave. There was a black range rover sitting on the edge of the\ntarmac almost right next to the door that would lead the rest of the passengers\ninto the airport.

There were crew members everywhere, shouting commands to\nmake sure that everything was ready to go. Anna weaved her way through them,\nbeing careful not to disturb them as she made her way to the back exit of the\nvenue. Herself and Harry were doing their best to keep things quiet so that his\nfans didn\u2019t find out before they were ready for them to know. Anna had a ticket\nto get into the venue the same way the fans did, she didn\u2019t have a treat people\nwith kindness sticker like Harry\u2019s other guests, but the whole crew and the\nvenue security knew who she was. She blended into the crowd as she walked past\nthe merch stand and into the front entrance where she walked quickly to the\ndoor on her ticket and into the arena. She couldn\u2019t get close to the front, the\nfans had lined the barrier and beyond, all excited for Harry to come on stage,\nso she remained at the back of the pit making sure she didn\u2019t disturb anyone,\nand hoped that he\u2019d be able to see her anyway. The pre-show playlist was\nechoing through the room and Anna watched as everyone around her sang along to\nOlivia by One Direction. </p><p>\u201cAnna?\u201d she felt a\nhand on her shoulder and turned around to see a dark haired woman in her late\nforties standing behind her. </p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d she smiled,\nwondering why she had been recognised all the way in Dallas Texas, she was sure\nher \u00a0blog didn\u2019t reach that far, although this woman\u2019s accent didn\u2019t sound\nAmerican. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Anne\u201d she held\nher hand out to shake Anna\u2019s \u201cHarry\u2019s Mum\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Anna said\nshaking her head and feeling a little stupid she knew that Anne was here but\nshe didn\u2019t know that Anne knew that she was here \u00a0\u201cHi, sorry, I didn\u2019t\nexpect to meet you tonight\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo sorry love it\u2019s\nmy fault, I shouldn\u2019t have snuck up behind you like that, I just had to meet\nthe girl my son hasn\u2019t shut up about for the last few months\u201d </p><p>Anna blushed \u201cHe\u2019s a\ngood guy, very gentlemanly, you did a wonderful job raising him\u201d </p><p>\u201cHe made it easy\u201d she\nsmiled \u201cSo I hear you write a blog, what do you write about\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever comes to\nmind, I post daily so sometimes I struggle to think of things, but that\u2019s part\nof the fun\u201d Anna admitted, curious about what Harry had said to her. </p><p>\u201cAnd you met him in\nLondon? At his show?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah\u201d Anna nodded\n\u201cMy friend, Ronnie, works for the O2 so he took me along and had me \u2018help\u2019\u201d she\nsaid using air quotes \u201cwith photography\u201d </p><p>Anne smiled \u201cWhat are\nfriends for?\u201d </p><p>Anna\u2019s heart sank a\nlittle, thinking about how much she missed Ronnie. \u201cYou must be incredibly\nproud\u201d Anna gestured around the room at the crowd that was now filling the\narena getting more and more excited with the end of each song on the playlist. </p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a mother\u2019s\ndream\u201d Anne nodded. </p><p>They stood together\nfor a while, getting to know each other, and Anna appreciated the effort Anne\nwas making to make her feel welcome, but it dawned on her that most of Harry\u2019s\nfans would recognise Anne and would be curious as to why she was talking to\nAnna and a handful of them would remember that she was at the London show, and\nthey might put two and two together. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry Anne,\u201d she\nsaid sympathetically \u201cHarry and I don\u2019t really know what this whole thing is\nyet, and we don\u2019t want people getting wind of it, if they see me with you they\nmight work it out\u201d </p><p>Anne nodded \u201cI\nunderstand love, we\u2019ll catch up backstage.\u201d </p><p>The show was about to\nstart, Harry would be standing on the stage by now, waiting for the screens to\nrise and Anna could feel his nerves for him, but she could also feel a pounding\nache in her head and she wished that she hadn\u2019t left her bag backstage. She\nrubbed her temples and tried to shake it off but the loud opening of Only Angel\nonly made it worse. She looked up at the stage and the lights made her eyes\nblur and she knew that she was getting a migraine. It had been years since she\u2019d\nhad one, she would have been about 18 the last time and she hoped to god this\none wouldn\u2019t be as bad. </p><p>Harry could see Anna\nfrom where he was standing on stage, and although there was hundreds of people\naround her, he thought she looked at little pale. He was midway through\nStockholm Syndrome but he had to make sure she was ok. </p><p>\u201cStop stop stop\u201d he\ncalled to the band and the music ceased. He pulled the mic off it\u2019s stand and\nwalked closer to where Anna was standing. </p><p>\u201cAre you ok up the\nback there?\u201d </p><p>The crowd around her\nscreamed which only made her headache worse. She knew he was talking about her,\nbut she thought for the sake of keeping it quiet, she tried to play dumb. </p><p>He caught on and\nfollowed in her footsteps \u201cYou, with the blonde hair and the lovely white\nblouse, are you alright, you look a bit ill\u201d </p><p>People turned around\nand pointed to her and she gave in. \u201cI\u2019m Ok\u201d she called holding her thumbs up\nin case he couldn\u2019t hear her</p><p>\u201cYou good? Need\nanything? Water maybe?\u201d </p><p>She nodded and\nwatched as Harry signalled a security guard that was standing near her and\nthrew one of his water bottles to him. </p><p>\u201cCould you give that\nto her please?\u201d </p><p>The water made its\nway to her and knowing who she was, the security guard stayed by her, making\nsure she was ok. </p><p>Anna stuck it out for\na few more songs, but by the time Harry was making his way to the b-stage she\ncouldn\u2019t wait any longer. She told the guard she had to go backstage and she\nrushed out of the room while Harry couldn\u2019t see. She didn\u2019t know how to get to\nHarry\u2019s dressing room from inside the venue, so the guard went with her and at\nthis point she didn\u2019t care if people started to work something out, she was\nsure they would be paying more attention to Harry anyway and she needed to take\nsome ibuprofen. </p><p>When she got to the\ndressing room she found her purse, pulled out her painkillers, and turned the\nlights out wishing her head would stop pounding.</p><p>She must have fallen\nasleep because the next thing she knew, she \u00a0woke up to Harry sitting next\nto her on the couch with his hand resting gently on her back. </p><p>\u201cAnna\u201d he whispered\nas her eyes blinked open \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d </p><p>She blinked a few\ntimes, adjusting to being awake again \u201cI got a migraine.\u201d </p><p>Her voice was soft\nand barely audible but Harry nodded and began rubbing circles around her back\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t look good out there, is there anything I can do?\u201d </p><p>\u201cCuddle me\u201d she\nwhispered.</p><hr><p>Big shout out to <a>@lovesmelikebrandnewstarlight</a>\u200b for talking through things with me and helping with the editing.

Packing had never been her strong point. It&rsquo;s one of the\nmain reasons she&rsquo;d avoided travel for so long. The furthest she&rsquo;d ever\ntraveled was Brighton and she&rsquo;d never been on a plane. She didn&rsquo;t know what\nshe needed to take with her to go on tour with one of the world&rsquo;s biggest pop\nstars. Would she need fancy outfits? Lounge wear? Casual outfits? She had no\nidea what she would be spending most of her time doing, or if she would be able\nto do laundry. One of everything is what she decided to go with, something for\nevery occasion and enough underwear for the whole trip so that if she wasn&rsquo;t\nable to do laundry, she wouldn&rsquo;t have to run out to the store for clean pants.\nShe sighed deeply worried that she wouldn&rsquo;t have what she needed but started\npacking it all into her bag anyway.</p><p>Half an hour later\nher suitcase was so full it wouldn&rsquo;t close and she slumped down onto her couch and\nregretted leaving the packing so late. Her flight left tomorrow morning at 7am\nand she hadn&rsquo;t even thought about packing her toiletries yet. </p><p>This is usually the\npoint where she would have given in and called Ronnie for help but things had\nbeen weird since Anna agreed to going away with Harry. They&rsquo;d barely spoken,\naside from the occasional text that let them know the other was still alive,\nthey didn&rsquo;t hang out, they didn&rsquo;t keep each other updated on their lives, Anna\ndidn&rsquo;t know where she stood with him now and that hurt. This had never happened\nbefore, the longest they&rsquo;d gone without speaking was probably 4 days a few\nyears ago when Ronnie went on holidays and had no phone service. As hard as she\ntried not to let it get to her, he didn&rsquo;t really know how to exist without him\nin her life, but she knew exactly what his problem was and that was what was\nbothering her the most. </p><p>*** </p><p>The alarm sounded in\nAnna&rsquo;s ear at 3:12am exactly and in that moment, she couldn&rsquo;t think of one\nlogical reason to get out of bed. What was the point in getting a first class\nflight if she still had to be awake at this ungodly hour? Of course she was\ngrateful that Harry had bought her ticket and arranged everything and she\nwanted to kick herself for being so bratty but it was early and she couldn&rsquo;t\nhelp it. She rolled over and switched off the blaring alarm which continued to\nring in her ears as she took her covers off and adjusted to the morning air.</p><p>Much to her surprise,\nshe had managed to get most of her packing done last night, all she had to do\nnow was get dressed, schedule her blog post, pack her laptop , clean her teeth,\npack her toothbrush, braid her hair and be out the door by 3:40. She checked\nher phone again. 3:20. She better get a move on.</p><p><b><i>Anna&rsquo;s 2018 Travel playlist</i></b></p><p><i>Last week I booked a spur of the moment trip to the US and I leave\nMonday so I thought I&rsquo;d share with you all the playlist I&rsquo;ll be listening to on\nthe plane. It&rsquo;s a trip I&rsquo;ve always dreamed about doing but between uni and\nother commitments I never had the time or the money, but now that I&rsquo;m done with\nuni and I&rsquo;ve had a few months to get this professional blogging thing on the\ngo, I thought I might as well and what could be more fun than taking you all\nalong with me? I&rsquo;ve never done this whole travel blogging thing before so don&rsquo;t\nexpect daily posts especially while I&rsquo;m dealing with jetlag. I&rsquo;m away for about\n6 weeks at this stage, but who knows, it could be longer!</i></p><p><i>Here are the tunes I&rsquo;ll be blasting while I&rsquo;m away, I&rsquo;ve made a Spotify\nplaylist for those of you that have it, check out the link at the end of this\npost.</i></p><ol><li><i>Give yourself a try - The 1975 </i></li>\n <li><i>Strawberries and cigarettes - Troye Sivan </i></li>\n <li><i>Sink In - Amy Shark </i></li>\n <li><i>Sign of the Times - Harry Styles </i></li>\n <li><i>Writer In the Dark - Lorde </i></li>\n <li><i>Rainbow - Kacey Musgraves </i></li>\n <li><i>Magnolia - Gang of Youths</i></li>\n <li><i>1950 - King Princess </i></li>\n <li><i>Sweet Creature - Harry Styles </i></li>\n <li><i>Hearts Don&rsquo;t Break Around Here - Ed Sheeran </i></li>\n <li><i> little\n &nbsp; &nbsp; light - lewis watson </i></li>\n <li><i>Kiwi - Harry Styles </i></li>\n <li><i> Still\n &nbsp; &nbsp; the One - Shania Twain (Don&rsquo;t judge, you know you love it as much as I do)\n &nbsp; &nbsp; </i></li>\n <li><i>Olivia - One Direction </i></li>\n <li><i>Hey Jude - The Beatles </i></li>\n <li><i>Yellow - Coldplay </i></li>\n <li><i>Only Angel - Harry Styles </i></li>\n <li><i>The Chain - Fleetwood Mac </i></li>\n <li><i>Starman - David Bowie </i></li>\n <li><i>Woman - Harry Styles</i></li>\n</ol><p>**** </p><p>&ldquo;Please remember to\nset your clocks to 12:33 pm local time&rdquo; the pilot said his voice echoing\nthrough the cabin as the plane touched down on the runway at Dallas airport.\n&nbsp;The flight hadn&rsquo;t been as bad as Anna thought it would have been, and\nmaybe that was because she was in first class and she got to sleep for most of\nit, or maybe it was because it was an early flight and the airport wasn&rsquo;t that\nbusy and she didn&rsquo;t have to stress about the crowds and finding the right\nplaces on time. It was all straight forward and she was thankful for that. </p><p>&ldquo;Miss Elliot&rdquo; One of\nthe flight attendants approched her as everyone was getting ready to get off\nthe plane </p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s me&rdquo; Anna\nreplied shyly. </p><p>&ldquo;Mr Styles has\narranged to meet you on the runway to avoid a commotion, so when you get off\nthe plane head straight for the security car, all of your luggage has already\nbeen taken there&rdquo; </p><p>Anna nodded and\nthanked her while she continued to pack her things away. She guessed that this\nwas part of the reason she had landed in New York first, so that she didn&rsquo;t\nhave to go through all the hassle of customs when she could be spending time\nwith Harry. She fixed her hair and makeup quickly and waited for the flight\nattendants to start ushering people off the plane. </p><p>The hot air washed\nover her as she stepped outside onto the tarmac, she knew it was going to be\nhot, but this is not what she had expected, the air was dry and the heat hit\nher like a wave. There was a black range rover sitting on the edge of the\ntarmac almost right next to the door that would lead the rest of the passengers\ninto the airport. As she made her way over to it it seemed obvious to her that\nHarry was waiting in there but she wondered if any of the other passengers\nguessed that someone as famous as him was sitting there or if it looked\ncompletely normal to them. </p><p>Anna reached the car\nand wrapped her fingers around the handle to the back door, taking a deep\nbreath as pulled it open. </p><p>&ldquo;Anna!&rdquo; Harry\nexclaimed, taking her hand and helping her into the car and kissing it as she\nsat down &ldquo;Long time no see.&rdquo; His smile was wide and Anna couldn&rsquo;t help but\nblush. </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only been two\nweeks&rdquo; she giggled </p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a long time&rdquo;\nHe nodded his head sarcastically. </p><p>&ldquo;I guess it is&rdquo; she\nleant up and kissed his cheek </p><p>&ldquo;How was the flight?&rdquo;\nhe asked moving slightly so that Anna could do her seatbelt up </p><p>&ldquo;I need a shower and\nsome moisturizer&rdquo; She laughed. </p><p>The car began to pull\naway from the tarmac </p><p>&ldquo;I figured you would.\nWe&rsquo;re going straight back to the hotel and we can go exploring later&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Thank you&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I uh&rdquo; Harry shifted\nin his seat feeling a little nervous &ldquo;I got you your own room, I wanted you to\nbe comfortable, but you&rsquo;re more than welcome to stay with me&rdquo; </p><p>Anna was secretly\npleased about this.

It had been years since she&rsquo;d\nhad one, she would have been about 18 the last time and she hoped to god this\none wouldn&rsquo;t be as bad. </p><p>Harry could see Anna\nfrom where he was standing on stage, and although there was hundreds of people\naround her, he thought she looked at little pale. He was midway through\nStockholm Syndrome but he had to make sure she was ok. </p><p>&ldquo;Stop stop stop&rdquo; he\ncalled to the band and the music ceased. He pulled the mic off it&rsquo;s stand and\nwalked closer to where Anna was standing. </p><p>&ldquo;Are you ok up the\nback there?&rdquo; </p><p>The crowd around her\nscreamed which only made her headache worse. She knew he was talking about her,\nbut she thought for the sake of keeping it quiet, she tried to play dumb. </p><p>He caught on and\nfollowed in her footsteps &ldquo;You, with the blonde hair and the lovely white\nblouse, are you alright, you look a bit ill&rdquo; </p><p>People turned around\nand pointed to her and she gave in. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Ok&rdquo; she called holding her thumbs up\nin case he couldn&rsquo;t hear her</p><p>&ldquo;You good? Need\nanything? Water maybe?&rdquo; </p><p>She nodded and\nwatched as Harry signalled a security guard that was standing near her and\nthrew one of his water bottles to him. </p><p>&ldquo;Could you give that\nto her please?&rdquo; </p><p>The water made its\nway to her and knowing who she was, the security guard stayed by her, making\nsure she was ok. </p><p>Anna stuck it out for\na few more songs, but by the time Harry was making his way to the b-stage she\ncouldn&rsquo;t wait any longer. She told the guard she had to go backstage and she\nrushed out of the room while Harry couldn&rsquo;t see. She didn&rsquo;t know how to get to\nHarry&rsquo;s dressing room from inside the venue, so the guard went with her and at\nthis point she didn&rsquo;t care if people started to work something out, she was\nsure they would be paying more attention to Harry anyway and she needed to take\nsome ibuprofen. </p><p>When she got to the\ndressing room she found her purse, pulled out her painkillers, and turned the\nlights out wishing her head would stop pounding.</p><p>She must have fallen\nasleep because the next thing she knew, she &nbsp;woke up to Harry sitting next\nto her on the couch with his hand resting gently on her back. </p><p>&ldquo;Anna&rdquo; he whispered\nas her eyes blinked open &ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo; </p><p>She blinked a few\ntimes, adjusting to being awake again &ldquo;I got a migraine.&rdquo; </p><p>Her voice was soft\nand barely audible but Harry nodded and began rubbing circles around her back\n&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t look good out there, is there anything I can do?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Cuddle me&rdquo; she\nwhispered.</p><hr /><p>Big shout out to <a>@lovesmelikebrandnewstarlight</a>&#8203; for talking through things with me and helping with the editing.

Packing had never been her strong point. It&rsquo;s one of the\nmain reasons she&rsquo;d avoided travel for so long. The furthest she&rsquo;d ever\ntraveled was Brighton and she&rsquo;d never been on a plane. She didn&rsquo;t know what\nshe needed to take with her to go on tour with one of the world&rsquo;s biggest pop\nstars. Would she need fancy outfits? Lounge wear? Casual outfits? She had no\nidea what she would be spending most of her time doing, or if she would be able\nto do laundry. One of everything is what she decided to go with, something for\nevery occasion and enough underwear for the whole trip so that if she wasn&rsquo;t\nable to do laundry, she wouldn&rsquo;t have to run out to the store for clean pants.\nShe sighed deeply worried that she wouldn&rsquo;t have what she needed but started\npacking it all into her bag anyway.</p>\n<p>Half an hour later\nher suitcase was so full it wouldn&rsquo;t close and she slumped down onto her couch and\nregretted leaving the packing so late. Her flight left tomorrow morning at 7am\nand she hadn&rsquo;t even thought about packing her toiletries yet. </p>\n<p>This is usually the\npoint where she would have given in and called Ronnie for help but things had\nbeen weird since Anna agreed to going away with Harry. They&rsquo;d barely spoken,\naside from the occasional text that let them know the other was still alive,\nthey didn&rsquo;t hang out, they didn&rsquo;t keep each other updated on their lives, Anna\ndidn&rsquo;t know where she stood with him now and that hurt. This had never happened\nbefore, the longest they&rsquo;d gone without speaking was probably 4 days a few\nyears ago when Ronnie went on holidays and had no phone service. As hard as she\ntried not to let it get to her, he didn&rsquo;t really know how to exist without him\nin her life, but she knew exactly what his problem was and that was what was\nbothering her the most. </p>\n<p>*** </p>\n<p>The alarm sounded in\nAnna&rsquo;s ear at 3:12am exactly and in that moment, she couldn&rsquo;t think of one\nlogical reason to get out of bed. What was the point in getting a first class\nflight if she still had to be awake at this ungodly hour? Of course she was\ngrateful that Harry had bought her ticket and arranged everything and she\nwanted to kick herself for being so bratty but it was early and she couldn&rsquo;t\nhelp it. She rolled over and switched off the blaring alarm which continued to\nring in her ears as she took her covers off and adjusted to the morning air.</p>\n<p>Much to her surprise,\nshe had managed to get most of her packing done last night, all she had to do\nnow was get dressed, schedule her blog post, pack her laptop , clean her teeth,\npack her toothbrush, braid her hair and be out the door by 3:40. She checked\nher phone again. 3:20. She better get a move on.</p>\n<p><b><i>Anna&rsquo;s 2018 Travel playlist</i></b></p>\n<p><i>Last week I booked a spur of the moment trip to the US and I leave\nMonday so I thought I&rsquo;d share with you all the playlist I&rsquo;ll be listening to on\nthe plane.

I accept submitted posts and will post anything that is not derogatory or rude. Please keep it civil, we are here to talk not belittle each other. Attackers will be blocked.NEW: I will now be cutting off or removing submissions that are just repeating discussions that have already taken place. Please read back if you have a question, chances are it's been answered. As an added note, we are aware that not all Harries are angry people but we sometimes generalize due to character limits, apologies in advance but we know there are many lovely, kind, friendly Harries out there and we don't mean to offend you. <!-- Start of StatCounter Code for Tumblr -->\n \n \n \n<!-- End of StatCounter Code for Tumblr -->",
