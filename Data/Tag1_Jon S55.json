Presumed dead, it comes as a shock to the Khaleesi, when her lover appears in Winterfell.</b></p><p><b><i>Word Count- 3252 words</i></b></p><p><b><i>Warning- Blood, presumed death, kissing, angst, fluff, and all that jazz.</i></b></p><hr><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to go with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. But I am choosing to do this. For you my Queen.\u201d</p><p>Daenerys rolls her eyes at Y/N\u2019s reply. A small smile gracing her face. \u00a0The pair watched as Jon and his men prepared the boats, ready to go beyond the wall.</p><p>Turning towards her Khaleesi, Y/N gently grabbed her face. Feeling the worry roll off of her in waves, Y/N leaned in to kiss Daenerys. Her lips moved across her lovers, as Daenerys\u2019 arms encircled the woman\u2019s waist. Pulling her as close as possible.</p><p>\u201cAre they always like this?\u201d</p><p>Jorah laughed at Jon\u2019s comment. </p><p>Walking to stand next to the young man, he clapped a hand on his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cThat woman has travelled farther and wider for Daenerys than even I have. Than anyone has. They always get a little more affectionate before she goes to fight.\u201d</p><p>Jon nodded his head in acknowledgement.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve come to guess it\u2019s some form of good luck or stay safe.\u201d</p><p>Pulling her lips away from her Khaleesi, Y/N smiled.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine. I always come back don\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>Daenerys didn\u2019t laugh.</p><p>She squeezed her lover\u2019s waist.</p><p>\u201cThe stakes are higher this time Y/N. The people need you to come back. I need you to come back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I will come back.\u201d</p><p>Taking a glance at the boats, Y/N could see that they were almost ready to board. Giving her Queen one last smile, she released her grip around her waist. Heading towards Jon and his men. Y/N threw her bag into the boat, sitting across from Jon and next to Gendry. \u00a0She watched Daenerys as the boat was pushed into the water. Their gaze never breaking until she and the men were a speck in the sea. </p><!-- more --><p>They rowed and rowed and rowed. </p><p>Y/N watched as the man steered the oars across the water.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re quite good at this, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Y/N stated towards the Baratheon bastard next to her.</p><p>Gendry laughed.</p><p>\u201cMore than you know.\u201d</p><p>Y/N kept mostly to herself. These men all knew each other. She was an outsider to them. She may be with the Khaleesi, but right now she only had Jorah, surrounded by boats overflowing with testosterone.</p><p>\u201cHow long have you been with the Mother of Dragons?\u201d</p><p>Raising her head at the voice, she looked at the man next to Jon Snow. \u00a0His hair and beard unruly, but they were as bright as the fire spit from the Khaleesi\u2019s dragons. </p><p>\u201cWe met when she gained control of the Dothraki after Khal Drogo\u2019s departure. I was made her maid in waiting.\u201d</p><p>The man smirked.</p><p>\u201cAh. So, you were fucking her whilst she was with the Dothraki king?\u201d</p><p>Leaning forward in her seat, Y/N\u2019s eyes pierced into Tormund\u2019s. Like daggers made of dragon glass.</p><p>His smirk fell.</p><p>\u201cUnlike you, horny cunt, I have control. I would never have disrespected the Khal in any way. Not that it is any of you fucker\u2019s business. But we were not together, until long after the death of Khal Drogo.\u201d</p><p>Leaning back, placing her hands on her knees, Y/N licked her lips. </p><p>\u201cI have worked my way from maid in waiting, to warrior, to commander-in-chief. I command all armies under the reign of the Khaleesi. I command the Dothraki, the Unsullied, the Iron Islands, The Westerlands, The Vale, and so much more. And if I wanted to, I could have command of you. You\u2019ve pledged support to the Khaleesi and you are a part of the army of the North. I could order you to jump overboard right now. And you would have to.\u201d</p><p>Gendry began to laugh at the woman\u2019s words, and at the fear across Tormund\u2019s face. </p><p>He continued to row.</p><p> Jon could not help but smile also.</p><p>A smirk once again settled on her face.</p><p>\u201cBut I won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Gendry ceased his laughter, disappointed taking over his features. </p><p>Y/N looked to Jon, smiling at the man\u2019s reaction. </p><p>With silence falling upon the four once more they continued their journey.</p><p>They spent hours rowing. Days even before they got to their desired location. \u00a0Once they had arrived the group had accumulated more men. Beric Dondarrion, The Hound, and other members of the Brotherhood. All ready to face the whites.</p><p>The group walked for miles. </p><p>\u201cWe need to rest. Stop for a short while.\u201d</p><p>Y/N rolled her eyes at Jon\u2019s words.</p><p>\u201cWere beyond the wall. If we rest, we die.\u201d</p><p>Jon grew agitated.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Of hyperthermia. We are stopping. That\u2019s final.\u201d</p><p>Of course, Y/N\u2019s prediction was right. As once the group ceased moving, the whites emerged. </p><p>They had rowed. They had walked. And now they had run.</p><p>Narrowly escaping, Jon had ordered Gendry to run back to the Eastwatch. They needed Daenerys to know what they found. To know they were in danger.</p><p>They had successfully killed and caught one white. But now they were surrounded; swarmed by hundreds. With the breaking of the ice the only thing separating few whites from themselves.</p><p>Standing between Jon and Clegane, Y/N watched as a single white walked towards them, dragging his sword along the ice.</p><p>\u201cPick up your fucking sword, you cunt.\u201d She shouted.</p><p>The men all turned to her, bewilderment across all their features.</p><p>She looked back in confusion.</p><p>\u201cWhat? The sound goes right through me.\u201d</p><p>As more whites began to approach, the men and woman took their stance; ready to fight.</p><p>As quick as lightning, the whites began to attack. Swinging her sword, she sliced through as many as she could. Trying to not get over powered. Throwing punches, kicks, and anything she could to kill as many as possible. But they were overpowered. For every member of their group, there was hundreds of whites. And not all of them had the Lord of Light lighting their swords on fire. They were greatly outnumbered.</p><p>Pushing her sword through the chest of a white, Y/N turned to the sound of Tormund screaming. Racing towards him as he was being buried by the undead creatures, much like Jorah, Y/N pulled her dagger out of its sheath. Stabbing those closest to Tormund with one hand, whilst using her sword to skewer many more surrounding them. Her actions gave enough time for Tormund to gain his footing. The pair standing back to back, decapitating those that came their way.</p><p>There was still too many. </p><p>Tormund could see that Jon and the others had climbed onto the raised rock in the middle of the frozen lake. </p><p>Turning around, he grabbed Y/N\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cCome on Commando, the Dragon Queen will kill me if you die by my side.\u201d</p><p>Running with Tormund, Y/N continued to swing her sword.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Commander not commando, you fire child!\u201d</p><p>Tormund\u2019s boisterous laugh rips through the cold air.</p><p>\u201cI know!\u201d</p><p>The successfully arrived at the rock. </p><p>Standing next to Jon, they could all see that there was no chance of them winning.</p><p>Not until the piercing screech of a dragon was heard.</p><p>Out of nowhere, Viserion, Drogon and Rhaegal appeared through the sky. Daenerys instructing her dragons to burn the whites. Trying her hardest to save Jon, his men, and her love. The men watched in astonishment as fire flooded the ground below them. Y/N smiled at the Khaleesi\u2019s abrupt appearance. She was always there when needed. </p><p>Landing one of Drogon near the group, Daenerys watched as Y/N helped the men climb on to Rhaegal. Viserion flying high in the sky, flames still pouring out the dragon\u2019s mouth; drowning the whites. As Jon was about to climb onto Rhaegal, a white appears out of nowhere. Before it can reach the King of the North, Y/N raises her sword to block the attack. Pushing the white back as much as she could. \u00a0Until her vision catches that of the Night King. </p><p>Staring straight into her soul, she watches as the frozen man walks through the fire. He walked through the fire. He walked through the fire. He walked thr-</p><p>\u201cDany go now! GO NOW!\u201d</p><p>Daenerys turned at the sound of her love\u2019s panicked voice. Aiming her own gaze at where she was looking.</p><p>As Y/N continued to push whites back, Jon ran to help. Slaying those that she could not see. </p><p>Before Daenery\u2019s could act on the woman\u2019s words, fear struck her heart, as she watched the Night King pierce his spear through Viserion. The dragon\u2019s body hurtling towards the frozen water. Blood falling through the sky like torrential rain. </p><p>Y/N\u2019s body froze at the sight.</p><p>\u201cGo.\u201d She whispered.</p><p>Her voice grew louder.</p><p>\u201cGO! GO! GO!\u201d</p><p>Jon repeated the woman\u2019s words. The pair turned to run towards the Khaleesi and her dragon. </p><p>Just before either could reach the group, a pair of whites appeared out of nowhere, hurtling into Jon. The force of their bodies causing the ice beneath them to break. </p><p>Y/N could do nothing as the ice below her began to crack, as so did the majority of which surrounded her. With the force of the stampeding whites hurtling her way, the ice below her feet split. With her last few moments above the water, Y/N caught the Khaleesi\u2019s gaze.<br/>\u201cS\u014dvegon!\u201d <br/>(\u201cFly!\u201d) </p><p>She screamed. </p><p>As she fell into the freeing depth below, Drogon and Rhaegel lifted towards the sky and away from the Frozen lake. Heading back to the Eastwatch.</p><p>Daenerys\u2019 stared down at the broken ice. Her body just as frozen. Shock coursing through her system in waves. Her heart and mind wept, but her body did not.</p><p>Under the ice, Y/N tried to calm herself. She could already feel her lungs start to lose air. Her body drifting lower and lower into the water. She watched as Jon swam back to the surface, pulling his body back through the hole in the ice. Her own body refused to co-operate. Exhaustion and hypothermia already taking over. She had accepted her fate. For her death would be honourable. Dying to protect her Khaleesi. Her Mother of Dragons. Her Daenerys.</p><p>As her body sank lower and lower, she closed her eyes, succumbing to the darkness. </p><p>Her whole body ached. Her head pounded as though rocks had been smashed onto her skull. </p><p>Wait. </p><p>She had a headache. Y/N was alive.</p><p>Opening her eyes slowly, she blinked to clear her vision. Carefully scouring the room in which she laid, it felt familiar. <br/>Y/N quickly turned her head to the sound of a door opening and closing. Watching as a young man entered the room. He was dressed in northern clothing. A dark black cape, with light brown trimming sat across his shoulders. His matte black hair laying softly on his head.</p><p>Y/N had not realised she was lying in a bed until his arrival. Pushing herself to sit upwards, the man\u2019s head rose at the unexpected noise. It seemed he had not realised she was awake.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry m\u2019lady. I did not know you had awoken.\u201d</p><p>She stared at the man. Her mind filled with questions.</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d </p><p>The young man shuffled towards her, a tray of food and a glass of ale in his hands. He placed them onto the bed, taking a step away, he folded his hands in front of his body.</p><p>\u201cMy name is Podrick, m\u2019lady.\u201d</p><p>For some reason, her body told her to trust this man. </p><p>\u201cPull up a chair Podrick because I have a lot of questions and, you are going to answer them. No scoot on over here. Do you want some ale, not a big fan, to be completely honest with you?\u201d</p><p>Podrick chuckled at the woman\u2019s brash behaviour. Grabbing the empty chair, near the window adjacent to the bed, Podrick sat near the woman. As Y/N scoffed down the bread before her, she took a sip of the ale, passing the cup to Podrick to drink straight after.</p><p>Wiping the food from her mouth, Y/N wasn\u2019t caring to be lady like. She was starving. </p><p>The pair sat in silence as Y/N ate the rest of the food. Drinking the last of the ale offered back by Podrick.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Pod.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome m\u2019lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall me Y/N. I\u2019m no rich woman.\u201d</p><p>She smiled at the squire.</p><p>Pulling the blanket closer to her, she sat up straighter, ready to ask the questions she needed answering.</p><p>\u201cHow did I end up here?\u201d</p><p>Podrick licked his lips as he fiddled with his hands. </p><p>\u201cWere not certain. Lady Sansa was called to the ground a few days ago. The guards had found your body at the gates, unconscious but breathing. Lady Sansa rushed you into the chambers where you were kept warm and on rest.\u201d</p><p>She nodded her head. </p><p>\u201cThe last thing I remember was falling into the ice, and then the face of a man. As blue as the cold, but he sounded like a Northener. I can\u2019t remember anything after that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you fall in the ice m\u2019lady? I mean Y/N?\u201d</p><p>Y/N looked towards Podrick. Her face turning sour.</p><p>\u201cI was battling the Night King and his whites.\u201d</p><p>Shock took over Podrick\u2019s features.</p><p>\u201cWith Jon Snow and his men?\u201d</p><p>The woman slowly nodded her head. </p><p>\u201cHe fell through the ice as well. I would be surprised if he is still alive. I am surprised I am.\u201d She laughed.</p><p>Her laughter grew quieter as Podrick\u2019s head began to shake. The look on his face turned her stomach queasy.</p><p>\u201cJon Snow is alive.\u201d</p><p>Confusion fell over Y/N.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know that?\u201d</p><p>Podrick gulped, fiddling with his hands once more, he answered Y/N\u2019s question.</p><p>\u201cHe arrived earlier today with the Mother of Dragon\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>Y/N stared at Podrick as the words left his mouth. </p><p>Daenerys was here. She was in the castle. </p><p>Shuffling the cover\u2019s off of her legs, Y/N sprung from the bed. Happy to see that she was in some form of clothing that covered her. She would question who dressed her later. But now she needed to get to her Khaleesi.</p><p>Seeing the woman\u2019s frustration, Podrick pointed towards the table.</p><p>He turned around to give her privacy, keeping his eyes closed as she changed.</p><p>\u201cLady Sansa and Lady Arya left you some items on the table. You seemed similar in stature to Lady Arya. There should be some clothes, a cloak, and a sword. Lady Arya said you looked like a fighter.\u201d</p><p>As Podrick was speaking, Y/N quickly got dressed, impressed at how the garments fit her perfectly.</p><p>At the sound of her sword being sheathed, Podrick turned around. Stunned at the sight before him. She looked ethereal. She looked powerful.</p><p>Y/N tied her hair in an intricate braid. Putting her hands to her sides, she looked at the squire.</p><p>\u201cLady Arya was right. I am a fighter.\u201d</p><p>Podrick and Y/N smiled at the woman\u2019s words.</p><p>\u201cNow Pod, can you show me where the Khaleesi will be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, Y/N.\u201d</p><p>He escorted her towards the door, closing it behind them.</p><p>The pair twist and turned down the corridors until they approach a large, heavy-set steel door. </p><p>Muffled voices could be heard as they approached.</p><p>\u201cThe Khaleesi is very important to you?\u201d asked Podrick.</p><p>\u201cYes, and I would hope I am important to her as well.\u201d</p><p>They stopped at the doors. The voices on the other side had become increasingly louder. She could hear loud chattering and disgruntled voices.</p><p>\u201cWhy is that?\u201d Podrick questioned.</p><p>Y/N smiled, gesturing him to open the doors.</p><p>As the doors creaked open she spoke.</p><p>\u201cWell, I am her wife.\u201d</p><p>Ignoring the shocked appearance of Podrick she strolled into the hall, Podrick not far behind her.</p><p>The noise was still very loud. So loud they had not even heard the doors open and close.</p><p>She could hear the voice of a women/</p><p>\u201cWhat do dragons eat anyway?\u201d</p><p>Another replied.</p><p>\u201cWhatever they want.\u201d</p><p>Ah. There was her Daenerys.</p><p>Rolling her eyes, she tried to push through the crowds of lords; to no avail. </p><p>She looked at Podrick. Pulling out her sword, she laid the tip on the ground.</p><p>\u201cFollow me and cover your ears, Pod. This sound will go right through you.\u201d</p><p>He did as she instructed. </p><p>Y/N began to scrape the sword across the stone floor. </p><p>The arguing of the Lords ceased, only to be replaced by their groans of pain. For all covered their ears at the piercing noise, moving out of the way of its direction. Y/N\u2019s path was now clear as she walked through the group of men, her sword still trailing behind her. The lords stepping out of the way, watching as she walked into the centre of the room; with Podrick close on her tale. Once she had arrived to the centre, she pulled her sword in front of her; ceasing the noise. </p><p>Silence embedded the room. Jon and the Khaleesi could not believe their eyes.</p><p>Y/N pointed at Jon. A smirk on her face.</p><p>\u201cTold you the sound goes right through you.\u201d</p><p>All eyes fell to the Khaleesi at the sound of her standing from her chair; the item toppling to the floor.</p><p>The pair stared at one another.</p><p>Daenerys slowly walked around the table, standing a few feet away from Y/N.</p><p>\u201cHow did you survive? Jon said he saw you drown?\u201d</p><p>Y/N laughed at the Khaleesi\u2019s words.</p><p>\u201cI did. But some blue Northern bloke saved me.\u201d</p><p>Jon knew she spoke of his uncle Benjen. For he had saved Jon as well.<br/>Y/N turned her gaze and body to Sansa. Kneeling down quickly, she arose soon after.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Lady Sansa for providing me warmth, shelter, food, and clothes. For not turning me away in my hour of need.\u201d</p><p>Whilst Sansa held a grudge against Daenerys, she could not help a small smile appear at Y/N\u2019s gratitude. </p><p>Daenerys watched the exchange. </p><p>Quickly looking towards Podrick, with the man still standing close behind her, she smiled.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Pod. You have been amazing help. I have made a friend for life in you.\u201d</p><p>Podrick could not help but blush at her words. Moving towards the side, Podrick smiled back at the woman.</p><p>Finally turning back towards her queen, Y/N stepped forwards. </p><p>A serious expression took over Y/N\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cI am sorry to have worried you. I should not have left Dragonstone. I should have stayed with you.\u201d</p><p>Daenerys shook her head, stepping closer as well.</p><p>\u201cNo. You fulfilled your role as Commander of the Targaryen armies. And you fulfilled your promise of coming back to me.\u201d</p><p>Y/N smiled.</p><p>\u201cI always come back, don\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>Daenerys rolled her eyes.</p><p>\u201cOh hush.\u201d</p><p>Daenerys slammed her lips onto Y/N\u2019s. Their last kiss being all those months ago, when she had sailed to fight the whites. Now she was back, in Daenerys\u2019 arms, read to fight them once more. </p><p>The pair broke apart at the sound of the hollers of the lords. </p><p>Stepping away from the Khaleesi, Y/N turned towards the room, unsheathing her sword as a warning. Her glare piercing through many of them men. The room quietened once more. Turning back to her queen, she put away her sword.</p><p>The Stark siblings could not help but smile at the woman\u2019s actions. Whilst Arya and Sansa held resentment towards the Queen, they could not help but admire the ferociousness of her partner. Jon was happy to see the woman alive. For he knew she would be an important asset towards the oncoming battle.</p><p>Winking at the Khaleesi, Y/N bowed towards Jon and Sansa, moving to stand by Podrick. He elbowed her side, making the woman laugh.</p><p>Daenerys smiled at the interaction. Moving back towards her seat, she sat down. <br/>The Khaleesi addressed the room.</p><p>\u201cTime to prepare for war.\u201d<br/></p><p><b>A/N- I hope you enjoyed it <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/macQgH5Em2WOamh_jQLHgnQ\">@path-of-fire</a> If anyone has anymore requests feel free to send.\u00a0</b></p>",

Giving her Queen one last smile, she released her grip around her waist. Heading towards Jon and his men. Y/N threw her bag into the boat, sitting across from Jon and next to Gendry. \u00a0She watched Daenerys as the boat was pushed into the water. Their gaze never breaking until she and the men were a speck in the sea. </p>[[MORE]]<p>They rowed and rowed and rowed. </p><p>Y/N watched as the man steered the oars across the water.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re quite good at this, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Y/N stated towards the Baratheon bastard next to her.</p><p>Gendry laughed.</p><p>\u201cMore than you know.\u201d</p><p>Y/N kept mostly to herself. These men all knew each other. She was an outsider to them. She may be with the Khaleesi, but right now she only had Jorah, surrounded by boats overflowing with testosterone.</p><p>\u201cHow long have you been with the Mother of Dragons?\u201d</p><p>Raising her head at the voice, she looked at the man next to Jon Snow. \u00a0His hair and beard unruly, but they were as bright as the fire spit from the Khaleesi\u2019s dragons. </p><p>\u201cWe met when she gained control of the Dothraki after Khal Drogo\u2019s departure. I was made her maid in waiting.\u201d</p><p>The man smirked.</p><p>\u201cAh. So, you were fucking her whilst she was with the Dothraki king?\u201d</p><p>Leaning forward in her seat, Y/N\u2019s eyes pierced into Tormund\u2019s. Like daggers made of dragon glass.</p><p>His smirk fell.</p><p>\u201cUnlike you, horny cunt, I have control. I would never have disrespected the Khal in any way. Not that it is any of you fucker\u2019s business. But we were not together, until long after the death of Khal Drogo.\u201d</p><p>Leaning back, placing her hands on her knees, Y/N licked her lips. </p><p>\u201cI have worked my way from maid in waiting, to warrior, to commander-in-chief. I command all armies under the reign of the Khaleesi. I command the Dothraki, the Unsullied, the Iron Islands, The Westerlands, The Vale, and so much more. And if I wanted to, I could have command of you. You\u2019ve pledged support to the Khaleesi and you are a part of the army of the North. I could order you to jump overboard right now. And you would have to.\u201d</p><p>Gendry began to laugh at the woman\u2019s words, and at the fear across Tormund\u2019s face. </p><p>He continued to row.</p><p> Jon could not help but smile also.</p><p>A smirk once again settled on her face.</p><p>\u201cBut I won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Gendry ceased his laughter, disappointed taking over his features. </p><p>Y/N looked to Jon, smiling at the man\u2019s reaction. </p><p>With silence falling upon the four once more they continued their journey.</p><p>They spent hours rowing. Days even before they got to their desired location. \u00a0Once they had arrived the group had accumulated more men. Beric Dondarrion, The Hound, and other members of the Brotherhood. All ready to face the whites.</p><p>The group walked for miles. </p><p>\u201cWe need to rest. Stop for a short while.\u201d</p><p>Y/N rolled her eyes at Jon\u2019s words.</p><p>\u201cWere beyond the wall. If we rest, we die.\u201d</p><p>Jon grew agitated.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Of hyperthermia. We are stopping. That\u2019s final.\u201d</p><p>Of course, Y/N\u2019s prediction was right. As once the group ceased moving, the whites emerged. </p><p>They had rowed. They had walked. And now they had run.</p><p>Narrowly escaping, Jon had ordered Gendry to run back to the Eastwatch. They needed Daenerys to know what they found. To know they were in danger.</p><p>They had successfully killed and caught one white. But now they were surrounded; swarmed by hundreds. With the breaking of the ice the only thing separating few whites from themselves.</p><p>Standing between Jon and Clegane, Y/N watched as a single white walked towards them, dragging his sword along the ice.</p><p>\u201cPick up your fucking sword, you cunt.\u201d She shouted.</p><p>The men all turned to her, bewilderment across all their features.</p><p>She looked back in confusion.</p><p>\u201cWhat? The sound goes right through me.\u201d</p><p>As more whites began to approach, the men and woman took their stance; ready to fight.</p><p>As quick as lightning, the whites began to attack. Swinging her sword, she sliced through as many as she could. Trying to not get over powered. Throwing punches, kicks, and anything she could to kill as many as possible. But they were overpowered. For every member of their group, there was hundreds of whites. And not all of them had the Lord of Light lighting their swords on fire. They were greatly outnumbered.</p><p>Pushing her sword through the chest of a white, Y/N turned to the sound of Tormund screaming. Racing towards him as he was being buried by the undead creatures, much like Jorah, Y/N pulled her dagger out of its sheath. Stabbing those closest to Tormund with one hand, whilst using her sword to skewer many more surrounding them. Her actions gave enough time for Tormund to gain his footing. The pair standing back to back, decapitating those that came their way.</p><p>There was still too many. </p><p>Tormund could see that Jon and the others had climbed onto the raised rock in the middle of the frozen lake. </p><p>Turning around, he grabbed Y/N\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cCome on Commando, the Dragon Queen will kill me if you die by my side.\u201d</p><p>Running with Tormund, Y/N continued to swing her sword.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Commander not commando, you fire child!\u201d</p><p>Tormund\u2019s boisterous laugh rips through the cold air.</p><p>\u201cI know!\u201d</p><p>The successfully arrived at the rock. </p><p>Standing next to Jon, they could all see that there was no chance of them winning.</p><p>Not until the piercing screech of a dragon was heard.</p><p>Out of nowhere, Viserion, Drogon and Rhaegal appeared through the sky. Daenerys instructing her dragons to burn the whites. Trying her hardest to save Jon, his men, and her love. The men watched in astonishment as fire flooded the ground below them. Y/N smiled at the Khaleesi\u2019s abrupt appearance. She was always there when needed. </p><p>Landing one of Drogon near the group, Daenerys watched as Y/N helped the men climb on to Rhaegal. Viserion flying high in the sky, flames still pouring out the dragon\u2019s mouth; drowning the whites. As Jon was about to climb onto Rhaegal, a white appears out of nowhere. Before it can reach the King of the North, Y/N raises her sword to block the attack. Pushing the white back as much as she could. \u00a0Until her vision catches that of the Night King. </p><p>Staring straight into her soul, she watches as the frozen man walks through the fire. He walked through the fire. He walked through the fire. He walked thr-</p><p>\u201cDany go now! GO NOW!\u201d</p><p>Daenerys turned at the sound of her love\u2019s panicked voice. Aiming her own gaze at where she was looking.</p><p>As Y/N continued to push whites back, Jon ran to help. Slaying those that she could not see. </p><p>Before Daenery\u2019s could act on the woman\u2019s words, fear struck her heart, as she watched the Night King pierce his spear through Viserion. The dragon\u2019s body hurtling towards the frozen water. Blood falling through the sky like torrential rain. </p><p>Y/N\u2019s body froze at the sight.</p><p>\u201cGo.\u201d She whispered.</p><p>Her voice grew louder.</p><p>\u201cGO! GO! GO!\u201d</p><p>Jon repeated the woman\u2019s words. The pair turned to run towards the Khaleesi and her dragon. </p><p>Just before either could reach the group, a pair of whites appeared out of nowhere, hurtling into Jon. The force of their bodies causing the ice beneath them to break. </p><p>Y/N could do nothing as the ice below her began to crack, as so did the majority of which surrounded her. With the force of the stampeding whites hurtling her way, the ice below her feet split. With her last few moments above the water, Y/N caught the Khaleesi\u2019s gaze.<br>\u201cS\u014dvegon!\u201d <br>(\u201cFly!\u201d) </p><p>She screamed. </p><p>As she fell into the freeing depth below, Drogon and Rhaegel lifted towards the sky and away from the Frozen lake. Heading back to the Eastwatch.</p><p>Daenerys\u2019 stared down at the broken ice. Her body just as frozen. Shock coursing through her system in waves. Her heart and mind wept, but her body did not.</p><p>Under the ice, Y/N tried to calm herself. She could already feel her lungs start to lose air. Her body drifting lower and lower into the water. She watched as Jon swam back to the surface, pulling his body back through the hole in the ice. Her own body refused to co-operate. Exhaustion and hypothermia already taking over. She had accepted her fate. For her death would be honourable. Dying to protect her Khaleesi. Her Mother of Dragons. Her Daenerys.</p><p>As her body sank lower and lower, she closed her eyes, succumbing to the darkness. </p><p>Her whole body ached. Her head pounded as though rocks had been smashed onto her skull. </p><p>Wait. </p><p>She had a headache. Y/N was alive.</p><p>Opening her eyes slowly, she blinked to clear her vision. Carefully scouring the room in which she laid, it felt familiar. <br>Y/N quickly turned her head to the sound of a door opening and closing. Watching as a young man entered the room. He was dressed in northern clothing. A dark black cape, with light brown trimming sat across his shoulders. His matte black hair laying softly on his head.</p><p>Y/N had not realised she was lying in a bed until his arrival. Pushing herself to sit upwards, the man\u2019s head rose at the unexpected noise. It seemed he had not realised she was awake.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry m\u2019lady. I did not know you had awoken.\u201d</p><p>She stared at the man. Her mind filled with questions.</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d </p><p>The young man shuffled towards her, a tray of food and a glass of ale in his hands. He placed them onto the bed, taking a step away, he folded his hands in front of his body.</p><p>\u201cMy name is Podrick, m\u2019lady.\u201d</p><p>For some reason, her body told her to trust this man. </p><p>\u201cPull up a chair Podrick because I have a lot of questions and, you are going to answer them. No scoot on over here. Do you want some ale, not a big fan, to be completely honest with you?\u201d</p><p>Podrick chuckled at the woman\u2019s brash behaviour. Grabbing the empty chair, near the window adjacent to the bed, Podrick sat near the woman. As Y/N scoffed down the bread before her, she took a sip of the ale, passing the cup to Podrick to drink straight after.</p><p>Wiping the food from her mouth, Y/N wasn\u2019t caring to be lady like. She was starving. </p><p>The pair sat in silence as Y/N ate the rest of the food. Drinking the last of the ale offered back by Podrick.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Pod.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome m\u2019lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall me Y/N. I\u2019m no rich woman.\u201d</p><p>She smiled at the squire.</p><p>Pulling the blanket closer to her, she sat up straighter, ready to ask the questions she needed answering.</p><p>\u201cHow did I end up here?\u201d</p><p>Podrick licked his lips as he fiddled with his hands. </p><p>\u201cWere not certain. Lady Sansa was called to the ground a few days ago. The guards had found your body at the gates, unconscious but breathing. Lady Sansa rushed you into the chambers where you were kept warm and on rest.\u201d</p><p>She nodded her head. </p><p>\u201cThe last thing I remember was falling into the ice, and then the face of a man. As blue as the cold, but he sounded like a Northener. I can\u2019t remember anything after that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you fall in the ice m\u2019lady? I mean Y/N?\u201d</p><p>Y/N looked towards Podrick. Her face turning sour.</p><p>\u201cI was battling the Night King and his whites.\u201d</p><p>Shock took over Podrick\u2019s features.</p><p>\u201cWith Jon Snow and his men?\u201d</p><p>The woman slowly nodded her head. </p><p>\u201cHe fell through the ice as well. I would be surprised if he is still alive. I am surprised I am.\u201d She laughed.</p><p>Her laughter grew quieter as Podrick\u2019s head began to shake. The look on his face turned her stomach queasy.</p><p>\u201cJon Snow is alive.\u201d</p><p>Confusion fell over Y/N.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know that?\u201d</p><p>Podrick gulped, fiddling with his hands once more, he answered Y/N\u2019s question.</p><p>\u201cHe arrived earlier today with the Mother of Dragon\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>Y/N stared at Podrick as the words left his mouth. </p><p>Daenerys was here. She was in the castle. </p><p>Shuffling the cover\u2019s off of her legs, Y/N sprung from the bed. Happy to see that she was in some form of clothing that covered her. She would question who dressed her later. But now she needed to get to her Khaleesi.</p><p>Seeing the woman\u2019s frustration, Podrick pointed towards the table.</p><p>He turned around to give her privacy, keeping his eyes closed as she changed.</p><p>\u201cLady Sansa and Lady Arya left you some items on the table. You seemed similar in stature to Lady Arya. There should be some clothes, a cloak, and a sword. Lady Arya said you looked like a fighter.\u201d</p><p>As Podrick was speaking, Y/N quickly got dressed, impressed at how the garments fit her perfectly.</p><p>At the sound of her sword being sheathed, Podrick turned around. Stunned at the sight before him. She looked ethereal. She looked powerful.</p><p>Y/N tied her hair in an intricate braid. Putting her hands to her sides, she looked at the squire.</p><p>\u201cLady Arya was right. I am a fighter.\u201d</p><p>Podrick and Y/N smiled at the woman\u2019s words.</p><p>\u201cNow Pod, can you show me where the Khaleesi will be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, Y/N.\u201d</p><p>He escorted her towards the door, closing it behind them.</p><p>The pair twist and turned down the corridors until they approach a large, heavy-set steel door. </p><p>Muffled voices could be heard as they approached.</p><p>\u201cThe Khaleesi is very important to you?\u201d asked Podrick.</p><p>\u201cYes, and I would hope I am important to her as well.\u201d</p><p>They stopped at the doors. The voices on the other side had become increasingly louder. She could hear loud chattering and disgruntled voices.</p><p>\u201cWhy is that?\u201d Podrick questioned.</p><p>Y/N smiled, gesturing him to open the doors.</p><p>As the doors creaked open she spoke.</p><p>\u201cWell, I am her wife.\u201d</p><p>Ignoring the shocked appearance of Podrick she strolled into the hall, Podrick not far behind her.</p><p>The noise was still very loud. So loud they had not even heard the doors open and close.</p><p>She could hear the voice of a women/</p><p>\u201cWhat do dragons eat anyway?\u201d</p><p>Another replied.</p><p>\u201cWhatever they want.\u201d</p><p>Ah. There was her Daenerys.</p><p>Rolling her eyes, she tried to push through the crowds of lords; to no avail. </p><p>She looked at Podrick. Pulling out her sword, she laid the tip on the ground.</p><p>\u201cFollow me and cover your ears, Pod. This sound will go right through you.\u201d</p><p>He did as she instructed. </p><p>Y/N began to scrape the sword across the stone floor. </p><p>The arguing of the Lords ceased, only to be replaced by their groans of pain. For all covered their ears at the piercing noise, moving out of the way of its direction. Y/N\u2019s path was now clear as she walked through the group of men, her sword still trailing behind her. The lords stepping out of the way, watching as she walked into the centre of the room; with Podrick close on her tale. Once she had arrived to the centre, she pulled her sword in front of her; ceasing the noise. </p><p>Silence embedded the room. Jon and the Khaleesi could not believe their eyes.</p><p>Y/N pointed at Jon. A smirk on her face.</p><p>\u201cTold you the sound goes right through you.\u201d</p><p>All eyes fell to the Khaleesi at the sound of her standing from her chair; the item toppling to the floor.</p><p>The pair stared at one another.</p><p>Daenerys slowly walked around the table, standing a few feet away from Y/N.</p><p>\u201cHow did you survive? Jon said he saw you drown?\u201d</p><p>Y/N laughed at the Khaleesi\u2019s words.</p><p>\u201cI did. But some blue Northern bloke saved me.\u201d</p><p>Jon knew she spoke of his uncle Benjen. For he had saved Jon as well.<br>Y/N turned her gaze and body to Sansa. Kneeling down quickly, she arose soon after.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Lady Sansa for providing me warmth, shelter, food, and clothes. For not turning me away in my hour of need.\u201d</p><p>Whilst Sansa held a grudge against Daenerys, she could not help a small smile appear at Y/N\u2019s gratitude. </p><p>Daenerys watched the exchange. </p><p>Quickly looking towards Podrick, with the man still standing close behind her, she smiled.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Pod. You have been amazing help. I have made a friend for life in you.\u201d</p><p>Podrick could not help but blush at her words. Moving towards the side, Podrick smiled back at the woman.</p><p>Finally turning back towards her queen, Y/N stepped forwards. </p><p>A serious expression took over Y/N\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cI am sorry to have worried you. I should not have left Dragonstone. I should have stayed with you.\u201d</p><p>Daenerys shook her head, stepping closer as well.</p><p>\u201cNo. You fulfilled your role as Commander of the Targaryen armies. And you fulfilled your promise of coming back to me.\u201d</p><p>Y/N smiled.</p><p>\u201cI always come back, don\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>Daenerys rolled her eyes.</p><p>\u201cOh hush.\u201d</p><p>Daenerys slammed her lips onto Y/N\u2019s. Their last kiss being all those months ago, when she had sailed to fight the whites. Now she was back, in Daenerys\u2019 arms, read to fight them once more. </p><p>The pair broke apart at the sound of the hollers of the lords. </p><p>Stepping away from the Khaleesi, Y/N turned towards the room, unsheathing her sword as a warning. Her glare piercing through many of them men. The room quietened once more. Turning back to her queen, she put away her sword.</p><p>The Stark siblings could not help but smile at the woman\u2019s actions. Whilst Arya and Sansa held resentment towards the Queen, they could not help but admire the ferociousness of her partner. Jon was happy to see the woman alive. For he knew she would be an important asset towards the oncoming battle.</p><p>Winking at the Khaleesi, Y/N bowed towards Jon and Sansa, moving to stand by Podrick. He elbowed her side, making the woman laugh.</p><p>Daenerys smiled at the interaction. Moving back towards her seat, she sat down. <br>The Khaleesi addressed the room.</p><p>\u201cTime to prepare for war.\u201d<br></p><p><b>A/N- I hope you enjoyed it <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/macQgH5Em2WOamh_jQLHgnQ\">@path-of-fire</a> If anyone has anymore requests feel free to send.\u00a0</b></p></p>",

But I am choosing to do this. For you my Queen.\u201d</p><p>Daenerys rolls her eyes at Y/N\u2019s reply. A small smile gracing her face. \u00a0The pair watched as Jon and his men prepared the boats, ready to go beyond the wall.</p><p>Turning towards her Khaleesi, Y/N gently grabbed her face. Feeling the worry roll off of her in waves, Y/N leaned in to kiss Daenerys. Her lips moved across her lovers, as Daenerys\u2019 arms encircled the woman\u2019s waist. Pulling her as close as possible.</p><p>\u201cAre they always like this?\u201d</p><p>Jorah laughed at Jon\u2019s comment. </p><p>Walking to stand next to the young man, he clapped a hand on his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cThat woman has travelled farther and wider for Daenerys than even I have. Than anyone has. They always get a little more affectionate before she goes to fight.\u201d</p><p>Jon nodded his head in acknowledgement.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve come to guess it\u2019s some form of good luck or stay safe.\u201d</p><p>Pulling her lips away from her Khaleesi, Y/N smiled.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine. I always come back don\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>Daenerys didn\u2019t laugh.</p><p>She squeezed her lover\u2019s waist.</p><p>\u201cThe stakes are higher this time Y/N. The people need you to come back. I need you to come back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I will come back.\u201d</p><p>Taking a glance at the boats, Y/N could see that they were almost ready to board. Giving her Queen one last smile, she released her grip around her waist. Heading towards Jon and his men. Y/N threw her bag into the boat, sitting across from Jon and next to Gendry. \u00a0She watched Daenerys as the boat was pushed into the water. Their gaze never breaking until she and the men were a speck in the sea. </p>[[MORE]]<p>They rowed and rowed and rowed. </p><p>Y/N watched as the man steered the oars across the water.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re quite good at this, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Y/N stated towards the Baratheon bastard next to her.</p><p>Gendry laughed.</p><p>\u201cMore than you know.\u201d</p><p>Y/N kept mostly to herself. These men all knew each other. She was an outsider to them. She may be with the Khaleesi, but right now she only had Jorah, surrounded by boats overflowing with testosterone.</p><p>\u201cHow long have you been with the Mother of Dragons?\u201d</p><p>Raising her head at the voice, she looked at the man next to Jon Snow. \u00a0His hair and beard unruly, but they were as bright as the fire spit from the Khaleesi\u2019s dragons. </p><p>\u201cWe met when she gained control of the Dothraki after Khal Drogo\u2019s departure. I was made her maid in waiting.\u201d</p><p>The man smirked.</p><p>\u201cAh. So, you were fucking her whilst she was with the Dothraki king?\u201d</p><p>Leaning forward in her seat, Y/N\u2019s eyes pierced into Tormund\u2019s. Like daggers made of dragon glass.</p><p>His smirk fell.</p><p>\u201cUnlike you, horny cunt, I have control. I would never have disrespected the Khal in any way. Not that it is any of you fucker\u2019s business. But we were not together, until long after the death of Khal Drogo.\u201d</p><p>Leaning back, placing her hands on her knees, Y/N licked her lips. </p><p>\u201cI have worked my way from maid in waiting, to warrior, to commander-in-chief. I command all armies under the reign of the Khaleesi. I command the Dothraki, the Unsullied, the Iron Islands, The Westerlands, The Vale, and so much more. And if I wanted to, I could have command of you. You\u2019ve pledged support to the Khaleesi and you are a part of the army of the North. I could order you to jump overboard right now. And you would have to.\u201d</p><p>Gendry began to laugh at the woman\u2019s words, and at the fear across Tormund\u2019s face. </p><p>He continued to row.</p><p> Jon could not help but smile also.</p><p>A smirk once again settled on her face.</p><p>\u201cBut I won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Gendry ceased his laughter, disappointed taking over his features. </p><p>Y/N looked to Jon, smiling at the man\u2019s reaction. </p><p>With silence falling upon the four once more they continued their journey.</p><p>They spent hours rowing. Days even before they got to their desired location. \u00a0Once they had arrived the group had accumulated more men. Beric Dondarrion, The Hound, and other members of the Brotherhood. All ready to face the whites.</p><p>The group walked for miles. </p><p>\u201cWe need to rest. Stop for a short while.\u201d</p><p>Y/N rolled her eyes at Jon\u2019s words.</p><p>\u201cWere beyond the wall. If we rest, we die.\u201d</p><p>Jon grew agitated.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Of hyperthermia. We are stopping. That\u2019s final.\u201d</p><p>Of course, Y/N\u2019s prediction was right. As once the group ceased moving, the whites emerged. </p><p>They had rowed. They had walked. And now they had run.</p><p>Narrowly escaping, Jon had ordered Gendry to run back to the Eastwatch. They needed Daenerys to know what they found. To know they were in danger.</p><p>They had successfully killed and caught one white. But now they were surrounded; swarmed by hundreds. With the breaking of the ice the only thing separating few whites from themselves.</p><p>Standing between Jon and Clegane, Y/N watched as a single white walked towards them, dragging his sword along the ice.</p><p>\u201cPick up your fucking sword, you cunt.\u201d She shouted.</p><p>The men all turned to her, bewilderment across all their features.</p><p>She looked back in confusion.</p><p>\u201cWhat? The sound goes right through me.\u201d</p><p>As more whites began to approach, the men and woman took their stance; ready to fight.</p><p>As quick as lightning, the whites began to attack. Swinging her sword, she sliced through as many as she could. Trying to not get over powered. Throwing punches, kicks, and anything she could to kill as many as possible. But they were overpowered. For every member of their group, there was hundreds of whites. And not all of them had the Lord of Light lighting their swords on fire. They were greatly outnumbered.</p><p>Pushing her sword through the chest of a white, Y/N turned to the sound of Tormund screaming. Racing towards him as he was being buried by the undead creatures, much like Jorah, Y/N pulled her dagger out of its sheath. Stabbing those closest to Tormund with one hand, whilst using her sword to skewer many more surrounding them. Her actions gave enough time for Tormund to gain his footing. The pair standing back to back, decapitating those that came their way.</p><p>There was still too many. </p><p>Tormund could see that Jon and the others had climbed onto the raised rock in the middle of the frozen lake. </p><p>Turning around, he grabbed Y/N\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cCome on Commando, the Dragon Queen will kill me if you die by my side.\u201d</p><p>Running with Tormund, Y/N continued to swing her sword.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Commander not commando, you fire child!\u201d</p><p>Tormund\u2019s boisterous laugh rips through the cold air.</p><p>\u201cI know!\u201d</p><p>The successfully arrived at the rock. </p><p>Standing next to Jon, they could all see that there was no chance of them winning.</p><p>Not until the piercing screech of a dragon was heard.</p><p>Out of nowhere, Viserion, Drogon and Rhaegal appeared through the sky. Daenerys instructing her dragons to burn the whites. Trying her hardest to save Jon, his men, and her love. The men watched in astonishment as fire flooded the ground below them. Y/N smiled at the Khaleesi\u2019s abrupt appearance. She was always there when needed. </p><p>Landing one of Drogon near the group, Daenerys watched as Y/N helped the men climb on to Rhaegal. Viserion flying high in the sky, flames still pouring out the dragon\u2019s mouth; drowning the whites. As Jon was about to climb onto Rhaegal, a white appears out of nowhere. Before it can reach the King of the North, Y/N raises her sword to block the attack. Pushing the white back as much as she could. \u00a0Until her vision catches that of the Night King. </p><p>Staring straight into her soul, she watches as the frozen man walks through the fire. He walked through the fire. He walked through the fire. He walked thr-</p><p>\u201cDany go now! GO NOW!\u201d</p><p>Daenerys turned at the sound of her love\u2019s panicked voice. Aiming her own gaze at where she was looking.</p><p>As Y/N continued to push whites back, Jon ran to help. Slaying those that she could not see. </p><p>Before Daenery\u2019s could act on the woman\u2019s words, fear struck her heart, as she watched the Night King pierce his spear through Viserion. The dragon\u2019s body hurtling towards the frozen water. Blood falling through the sky like torrential rain. </p><p>Y/N\u2019s body froze at the sight.</p><p>\u201cGo.\u201d She whispered.</p><p>Her voice grew louder.</p><p>\u201cGO! GO! GO!\u201d</p><p>Jon repeated the woman\u2019s words. The pair turned to run towards the Khaleesi and her dragon. </p><p>Just before either could reach the group, a pair of whites appeared out of nowhere, hurtling into Jon. The force of their bodies causing the ice beneath them to break. </p><p>Y/N could do nothing as the ice below her began to crack, as so did the majority of which surrounded her. With the force of the stampeding whites hurtling her way, the ice below her feet split. With her last few moments above the water, Y/N caught the Khaleesi\u2019s gaze.<br>\u201cS\u014dvegon!\u201d <br>(\u201cFly!\u201d) </p><p>She screamed. </p><p>As she fell into the freeing depth below, Drogon and Rhaegel lifted towards the sky and away from the Frozen lake. Heading back to the Eastwatch.</p><p>Daenerys\u2019 stared down at the broken ice. Her body just as frozen. Shock coursing through her system in waves. Her heart and mind wept, but her body did not.</p><p>Under the ice, Y/N tried to calm herself. She could already feel her lungs start to lose air. Her body drifting lower and lower into the water. She watched as Jon swam back to the surface, pulling his body back through the hole in the ice. Her own body refused to co-operate. Exhaustion and hypothermia already taking over. She had accepted her fate. For her death would be honourable. Dying to protect her Khaleesi. Her Mother of Dragons. Her Daenerys.</p><p>As her body sank lower and lower, she closed her eyes, succumbing to the darkness. </p><p>Her whole body ached. Her head pounded as though rocks had been smashed onto her skull. </p><p>Wait. </p><p>She had a headache. Y/N was alive.</p><p>Opening her eyes slowly, she blinked to clear her vision. Carefully scouring the room in which she laid, it felt familiar. <br>Y/N quickly turned her head to the sound of a door opening and closing. Watching as a young man entered the room. He was dressed in northern clothing. A dark black cape, with light brown trimming sat across his shoulders. His matte black hair laying softly on his head.</p><p>Y/N had not realised she was lying in a bed until his arrival. Pushing herself to sit upwards, the man\u2019s head rose at the unexpected noise. It seemed he had not realised she was awake.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry m\u2019lady. I did not know you had awoken.\u201d</p><p>She stared at the man. Her mind filled with questions.</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d </p><p>The young man shuffled towards her, a tray of food and a glass of ale in his hands. He placed them onto the bed, taking a step away, he folded his hands in front of his body.</p><p>\u201cMy name is Podrick, m\u2019lady.\u201d</p><p>For some reason, her body told her to trust this man. </p><p>\u201cPull up a chair Podrick because I have a lot of questions and, you are going to answer them. No scoot on over here. Do you want some ale, not a big fan, to be completely honest with you?\u201d</p><p>Podrick chuckled at the woman\u2019s brash behaviour. Grabbing the empty chair, near the window adjacent to the bed, Podrick sat near the woman. As Y/N scoffed down the bread before her, she took a sip of the ale, passing the cup to Podrick to drink straight after.</p><p>Wiping the food from her mouth, Y/N wasn\u2019t caring to be lady like. She was starving. </p><p>The pair sat in silence as Y/N ate the rest of the food. Drinking the last of the ale offered back by Podrick.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Pod.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome m\u2019lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall me Y/N. I\u2019m no rich woman.\u201d</p><p>She smiled at the squire.</p><p>Pulling the blanket closer to her, she sat up straighter, ready to ask the questions she needed answering.</p><p>\u201cHow did I end up here?\u201d</p><p>Podrick licked his lips as he fiddled with his hands. </p><p>\u201cWere not certain. Lady Sansa was called to the ground a few days ago. The guards had found your body at the gates, unconscious but breathing. Lady Sansa rushed you into the chambers where you were kept warm and on rest.\u201d</p><p>She nodded her head. </p><p>\u201cThe last thing I remember was falling into the ice, and then the face of a man. As blue as the cold, but he sounded like a Northener. I can\u2019t remember anything after that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you fall in the ice m\u2019lady? I mean Y/N?\u201d</p><p>Y/N looked towards Podrick. Her face turning sour.</p><p>\u201cI was battling the Night King and his whites.\u201d</p><p>Shock took over Podrick\u2019s features.</p><p>\u201cWith Jon Snow and his men?\u201d</p><p>The woman slowly nodded her head. </p><p>\u201cHe fell through the ice as well. I would be surprised if he is still alive. I am surprised I am.\u201d She laughed.</p><p>Her laughter grew quieter as Podrick\u2019s head began to shake. The look on his face turned her stomach queasy.</p><p>\u201cJon Snow is alive.\u201d</p><p>Confusion fell over Y/N.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know that?\u201d</p><p>Podrick gulped, fiddling with his hands once more, he answered Y/N\u2019s question.</p><p>\u201cHe arrived earlier today with the Mother of Dragon\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>Y/N stared at Podrick as the words left his mouth. </p><p>Daenerys was here. She was in the castle. </p><p>Shuffling the cover\u2019s off of her legs, Y/N sprung from the bed. Happy to see that she was in some form of clothing that covered her. She would question who dressed her later. But now she needed to get to her Khaleesi.</p><p>Seeing the woman\u2019s frustration, Podrick pointed towards the table.</p><p>He turned around to give her privacy, keeping his eyes closed as she changed.</p><p>\u201cLady Sansa and Lady Arya left you some items on the table. You seemed similar in stature to Lady Arya. There should be some clothes, a cloak, and a sword. Lady Arya said you looked like a fighter.\u201d</p><p>As Podrick was speaking, Y/N quickly got dressed, impressed at how the garments fit her perfectly.</p><p>At the sound of her sword being sheathed, Podrick turned around. Stunned at the sight before him. She looked ethereal. She looked powerful.</p><p>Y/N tied her hair in an intricate braid. Putting her hands to her sides, she looked at the squire.</p><p>\u201cLady Arya was right. I am a fighter.\u201d</p><p>Podrick and Y/N smiled at the woman\u2019s words.</p><p>\u201cNow Pod, can you show me where the Khaleesi will be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, Y/N.\u201d</p><p>He escorted her towards the door, closing it behind them.</p><p>The pair twist and turned down the corridors until they approach a large, heavy-set steel door. </p><p>Muffled voices could be heard as they approached.</p><p>\u201cThe Khaleesi is very important to you?\u201d asked Podrick.</p><p>\u201cYes, and I would hope I am important to her as well.\u201d</p><p>They stopped at the doors. The voices on the other side had become increasingly louder. She could hear loud chattering and disgruntled voices.</p><p>\u201cWhy is that?\u201d Podrick questioned.</p><p>Y/N smiled, gesturing him to open the doors.</p><p>As the doors creaked open she spoke.</p><p>\u201cWell, I am her wife.\u201d</p><p>Ignoring the shocked appearance of Podrick she strolled into the hall, Podrick not far behind her.</p><p>The noise was still very loud. So loud they had not even heard the doors open and close.</p><p>She could hear the voice of a women/</p><p>\u201cWhat do dragons eat anyway?\u201d</p><p>Another replied.</p><p>\u201cWhatever they want.\u201d</p><p>Ah. There was her Daenerys.</p><p>Rolling her eyes, she tried to push through the crowds of lords; to no avail. </p><p>She looked at Podrick. Pulling out her sword, she laid the tip on the ground.</p><p>\u201cFollow me and cover your ears, Pod. This sound will go right through you.\u201d</p><p>He did as she instructed. </p><p>Y/N began to scrape the sword across the stone floor. </p><p>The arguing of the Lords ceased, only to be replaced by their groans of pain. For all covered their ears at the piercing noise, moving out of the way of its direction. Y/N\u2019s path was now clear as she walked through the group of men, her sword still trailing behind her. The lords stepping out of the way, watching as she walked into the centre of the room; with Podrick close on her tale. Once she had arrived to the centre, she pulled her sword in front of her; ceasing the noise. </p><p>Silence embedded the room. Jon and the Khaleesi could not believe their eyes.</p><p>Y/N pointed at Jon. A smirk on her face.</p><p>\u201cTold you the sound goes right through you.\u201d</p><p>All eyes fell to the Khaleesi at the sound of her standing from her chair; the item toppling to the floor.</p><p>The pair stared at one another.</p><p>Daenerys slowly walked around the table, standing a few feet away from Y/N.</p><p>\u201cHow did you survive? Jon said he saw you drown?\u201d</p><p>Y/N laughed at the Khaleesi\u2019s words.</p><p>\u201cI did. But some blue Northern bloke saved me.\u201d</p><p>Jon knew she spoke of his uncle Benjen. For he had saved Jon as well.<br>Y/N turned her gaze and body to Sansa. Kneeling down quickly, she arose soon after.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Lady Sansa for providing me warmth, shelter, food, and clothes. For not turning me away in my hour of need.\u201d</p><p>Whilst Sansa held a grudge against Daenerys, she could not help a small smile appear at Y/N\u2019s gratitude. </p><p>Daenerys watched the exchange. </p><p>Quickly looking towards Podrick, with the man still standing close behind her, she smiled.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Pod. You have been amazing help. I have made a friend for life in you.\u201d</p><p>Podrick could not help but blush at her words. Moving towards the side, Podrick smiled back at the woman.</p><p>Finally turning back towards her queen, Y/N stepped forwards. </p><p>A serious expression took over Y/N\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cI am sorry to have worried you. I should not have left Dragonstone. I should have stayed with you.\u201d</p><p>Daenerys shook her head, stepping closer as well.</p><p>\u201cNo. You fulfilled your role as Commander of the Targaryen armies. And you fulfilled your promise of coming back to me.\u201d</p><p>Y/N smiled.</p><p>\u201cI always come back, don\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>Daenerys rolled her eyes.</p><p>\u201cOh hush.\u201d</p><p>Daenerys slammed her lips onto Y/N\u2019s. Their last kiss being all those months ago, when she had sailed to fight the whites. Now she was back, in Daenerys\u2019 arms, read to fight them once more. </p><p>The pair broke apart at the sound of the hollers of the lords. </p><p>Stepping away from the Khaleesi, Y/N turned towards the room, unsheathing her sword as a warning. Her glare piercing through many of them men. The room quietened once more. Turning back to her queen, she put away her sword.</p><p>The Stark siblings could not help but smile at the woman\u2019s actions. Whilst Arya and Sansa held resentment towards the Queen, they could not help but admire the ferociousness of her partner. Jon was happy to see the woman alive. For he knew she would be an important asset towards the oncoming battle.</p><p>Winking at the Khaleesi, Y/N bowed towards Jon and Sansa, moving to stand by Podrick. He elbowed her side, making the woman laugh.</p><p>Daenerys smiled at the interaction. Moving back towards her seat, she sat down. <br>The Khaleesi addressed the room.</p><p>\u201cTime to prepare for war.\u201d<br></p><p><b>A/N- I hope you enjoyed it <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/macQgH5Em2WOamh_jQLHgnQ\">@path-of-fire</a> If anyone has anymore requests feel free to send.\u00a0</b></p></p>",

Their gaze never breaking until she and the men were a speck in the sea. </p><p>They rowed and rowed and rowed. </p><p>Y/N watched as the man steered the oars across the water.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re quite good at this, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; Y/N stated towards the Baratheon bastard next to her.</p><p>Gendry laughed.</p><p>&ldquo;More than you know.&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N kept mostly to herself. These men all knew each other. She was an outsider to them. She may be with the Khaleesi, but right now she only had Jorah, surrounded by boats overflowing with testosterone.</p><p>&ldquo;How long have you been with the Mother of Dragons?&rdquo;</p><p>Raising her head at the voice, she looked at the man next to Jon Snow. &nbsp;His hair and beard unruly, but they were as bright as the fire spit from the Khaleesi&rsquo;s dragons. </p><p>&ldquo;We met when she gained control of the Dothraki after Khal Drogo&rsquo;s departure. I was made her maid in waiting.&rdquo;</p><p>The man smirked.</p><p>&ldquo;Ah. So, you were fucking her whilst she was with the Dothraki king?&rdquo;</p><p>Leaning forward in her seat, Y/N&rsquo;s eyes pierced into Tormund&rsquo;s. Like daggers made of dragon glass.</p><p>His smirk fell.</p><p>&ldquo;Unlike you, horny cunt, I have control. I would never have disrespected the Khal in any way. Not that it is any of you fucker&rsquo;s business. But we were not together, until long after the death of Khal Drogo.&rdquo;</p><p>Leaning back, placing her hands on her knees, Y/N licked her lips. </p><p>&ldquo;I have worked my way from maid in waiting, to warrior, to commander-in-chief. I command all armies under the reign of the Khaleesi. I command the Dothraki, the Unsullied, the Iron Islands, The Westerlands, The Vale, and so much more. And if I wanted to, I could have command of you. You&rsquo;ve pledged support to the Khaleesi and you are a part of the army of the North. I could order you to jump overboard right now. And you would have to.&rdquo;</p><p>Gendry began to laugh at the woman&rsquo;s words, and at the fear across Tormund&rsquo;s face. </p><p>He continued to row.</p><p> Jon could not help but smile also.</p><p>A smirk once again settled on her face.</p><p>&ldquo;But I won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p><p>Gendry ceased his laughter, disappointed taking over his features. </p><p>Y/N looked to Jon, smiling at the man&rsquo;s reaction. </p><p>With silence falling upon the four once more they continued their journey.</p><p>They spent hours rowing. Days even before they got to their desired location. &nbsp;Once they had arrived the group had accumulated more men. Beric Dondarrion, The Hound, and other members of the Brotherhood. All ready to face the whites.</p><p>The group walked for miles. </p><p>&ldquo;We need to rest. Stop for a short while.&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N rolled her eyes at Jon&rsquo;s words.</p><p>&ldquo;Were beyond the wall. If we rest, we die.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon grew agitated.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah. Of hyperthermia. We are stopping. That&rsquo;s final.&rdquo;</p><p>Of course, Y/N&rsquo;s prediction was right. As once the group ceased moving, the whites emerged. </p><p>They had rowed. They had walked. And now they had run.</p><p>Narrowly escaping, Jon had ordered Gendry to run back to the Eastwatch. They needed Daenerys to know what they found. To know they were in danger.</p><p>They had successfully killed and caught one white. But now they were surrounded; swarmed by hundreds. With the breaking of the ice the only thing separating few whites from themselves.</p><p>Standing between Jon and Clegane, Y/N watched as a single white walked towards them, dragging his sword along the ice.</p><p>&ldquo;Pick up your fucking sword, you cunt.&rdquo; She shouted.</p><p>The men all turned to her, bewilderment across all their features.</p><p>She looked back in confusion.</p><p>&ldquo;What? The sound goes right through me.&rdquo;</p><p>As more whites began to approach, the men and woman took their stance; ready to fight.</p><p>As quick as lightning, the whites began to attack. Swinging her sword, she sliced through as many as she could. Trying to not get over powered. Throwing punches, kicks, and anything she could to kill as many as possible. But they were overpowered. For every member of their group, there was hundreds of whites. And not all of them had the Lord of Light lighting their swords on fire. They were greatly outnumbered.</p><p>Pushing her sword through the chest of a white, Y/N turned to the sound of Tormund screaming. Racing towards him as he was being buried by the undead creatures, much like Jorah, Y/N pulled her dagger out of its sheath. Stabbing those closest to Tormund with one hand, whilst using her sword to skewer many more surrounding them. Her actions gave enough time for Tormund to gain his footing. The pair standing back to back, decapitating those that came their way.</p><p>There was still too many. </p><p>Tormund could see that Jon and the others had climbed onto the raised rock in the middle of the frozen lake. </p><p>Turning around, he grabbed Y/N&rsquo;s hand.</p><p>&ldquo;Come on Commando, the Dragon Queen will kill me if you die by my side.&rdquo;</p><p>Running with Tormund, Y/N continued to swing her sword.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Commander not commando, you fire child!&rdquo;</p><p>Tormund&rsquo;s boisterous laugh rips through the cold air.</p><p>&ldquo;I know!&rdquo;</p><p>The successfully arrived at the rock. </p><p>Standing next to Jon, they could all see that there was no chance of them winning.</p><p>Not until the piercing screech of a dragon was heard.</p><p>Out of nowhere, Viserion, Drogon and Rhaegal appeared through the sky. Daenerys instructing her dragons to burn the whites. Trying her hardest to save Jon, his men, and her love. The men watched in astonishment as fire flooded the ground below them. Y/N smiled at the Khaleesi&rsquo;s abrupt appearance. She was always there when needed. </p><p>Landing one of Drogon near the group, Daenerys watched as Y/N helped the men climb on to Rhaegal. Viserion flying high in the sky, flames still pouring out the dragon&rsquo;s mouth; drowning the whites. As Jon was about to climb onto Rhaegal, a white appears out of nowhere. Before it can reach the King of the North, Y/N raises her sword to block the attack. Pushing the white back as much as she could. &nbsp;Until her vision catches that of the Night King. </p><p>Staring straight into her soul, she watches as the frozen man walks through the fire. He walked through the fire. He walked through the fire. He walked thr-</p><p>&ldquo;Dany go now! GO NOW!&rdquo;</p><p>Daenerys turned at the sound of her love&rsquo;s panicked voice. Aiming her own gaze at where she was looking.</p><p>As Y/N continued to push whites back, Jon ran to help. Slaying those that she could not see. </p><p>Before Daenery&rsquo;s could act on the woman&rsquo;s words, fear struck her heart, as she watched the Night King pierce his spear through Viserion. The dragon&rsquo;s body hurtling towards the frozen water. Blood falling through the sky like torrential rain. </p><p>Y/N&rsquo;s body froze at the sight.</p><p>&ldquo;Go.&rdquo; She whispered.</p><p>Her voice grew louder.</p><p>&ldquo;GO! GO! GO!&rdquo;</p><p>Jon repeated the woman&rsquo;s words. The pair turned to run towards the Khaleesi and her dragon. </p><p>Just before either could reach the group, a pair of whites appeared out of nowhere, hurtling into Jon. The force of their bodies causing the ice beneath them to break. </p><p>Y/N could do nothing as the ice below her began to crack, as so did the majority of which surrounded her. With the force of the stampeding whites hurtling her way, the ice below her feet split. With her last few moments above the water, Y/N caught the Khaleesi&rsquo;s gaze.<br />&ldquo;S&#333;vegon!&rdquo; <br />(&ldquo;Fly!&rdquo;) </p><p>She screamed. </p><p>As she fell into the freeing depth below, Drogon and Rhaegel lifted towards the sky and away from the Frozen lake. Heading back to the Eastwatch.</p><p>Daenerys&rsquo; stared down at the broken ice. Her body just as frozen. Shock coursing through her system in waves. Her heart and mind wept, but her body did not.</p><p>Under the ice, Y/N tried to calm herself. She could already feel her lungs start to lose air. Her body drifting lower and lower into the water. She watched as Jon swam back to the surface, pulling his body back through the hole in the ice. Her own body refused to co-operate. Exhaustion and hypothermia already taking over. She had accepted her fate. For her death would be honourable. Dying to protect her Khaleesi. Her Mother of Dragons. Her Daenerys.</p><p>As her body sank lower and lower, she closed her eyes, succumbing to the darkness. </p><p>Her whole body ached. Her head pounded as though rocks had been smashed onto her skull. </p><p>Wait. </p><p>She had a headache. Y/N was alive.</p><p>Opening her eyes slowly, she blinked to clear her vision. Carefully scouring the room in which she laid, it felt familiar. <br />Y/N quickly turned her head to the sound of a door opening and closing. Watching as a young man entered the room. He was dressed in northern clothing. A dark black cape, with light brown trimming sat across his shoulders. His matte black hair laying softly on his head.</p><p>Y/N had not realised she was lying in a bed until his arrival. Pushing herself to sit upwards, the man&rsquo;s head rose at the unexpected noise. It seemed he had not realised she was awake.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry m&rsquo;lady. I did not know you had awoken.&rdquo;</p><p>She stared at the man. Her mind filled with questions.</p><p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; </p><p>The young man shuffled towards her, a tray of food and a glass of ale in his hands. He placed them onto the bed, taking a step away, he folded his hands in front of his body.</p><p>&ldquo;My name is Podrick, m&rsquo;lady.&rdquo;</p><p>For some reason, her body told her to trust this man. </p><p>&ldquo;Pull up a chair Podrick because I have a lot of questions and, you are going to answer them. No scoot on over here. Do you want some ale, not a big fan, to be completely honest with you?&rdquo;</p><p>Podrick chuckled at the woman&rsquo;s brash behaviour. Grabbing the empty chair, near the window adjacent to the bed, Podrick sat near the woman. As Y/N scoffed down the bread before her, she took a sip of the ale, passing the cup to Podrick to drink straight after.</p><p>Wiping the food from her mouth, Y/N wasn&rsquo;t caring to be lady like. She was starving. </p><p>The pair sat in silence as Y/N ate the rest of the food. Drinking the last of the ale offered back by Podrick.</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you, Pod.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re welcome m&rsquo;lady.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Call me Y/N. I&rsquo;m no rich woman.&rdquo;</p><p>She smiled at the squire.</p><p>Pulling the blanket closer to her, she sat up straighter, ready to ask the questions she needed answering.</p><p>&ldquo;How did I end up here?&rdquo;</p><p>Podrick licked his lips as he fiddled with his hands. </p><p>&ldquo;Were not certain. Lady Sansa was called to the ground a few days ago. The guards had found your body at the gates, unconscious but breathing. Lady Sansa rushed you into the chambers where you were kept warm and on rest.&rdquo;</p><p>She nodded her head. </p><p>&ldquo;The last thing I remember was falling into the ice, and then the face of a man. As blue as the cold, but he sounded like a Northener. I can&rsquo;t remember anything after that.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How did you fall in the ice m&rsquo;lady? I mean Y/N?&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N looked towards Podrick. Her face turning sour.</p><p>&ldquo;I was battling the Night King and his whites.&rdquo;</p><p>Shock took over Podrick&rsquo;s features.</p><p>&ldquo;With Jon Snow and his men?&rdquo;</p><p>The woman slowly nodded her head. </p><p>&ldquo;He fell through the ice as well. I would be surprised if he is still alive. I am surprised I am.&rdquo; She laughed.</p><p>Her laughter grew quieter as Podrick&rsquo;s head began to shake. The look on his face turned her stomach queasy.</p><p>&ldquo;Jon Snow is alive.&rdquo;</p><p>Confusion fell over Y/N.</p><p>&ldquo;How do you know that?&rdquo;</p><p>Podrick gulped, fiddling with his hands once more, he answered Y/N&rsquo;s question.</p><p>&ldquo;He arrived earlier today with the Mother of Dragon&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N stared at Podrick as the words left his mouth. </p><p>Daenerys was here. She was in the castle. </p><p>Shuffling the cover&rsquo;s off of her legs, Y/N sprung from the bed. Happy to see that she was in some form of clothing that covered her. She would question who dressed her later. But now she needed to get to her Khaleesi.</p><p>Seeing the woman&rsquo;s frustration, Podrick pointed towards the table.</p><p>He turned around to give her privacy, keeping his eyes closed as she changed.</p><p>&ldquo;Lady Sansa and Lady Arya left you some items on the table. You seemed similar in stature to Lady Arya. There should be some clothes, a cloak, and a sword. Lady Arya said you looked like a fighter.&rdquo;</p><p>As Podrick was speaking, Y/N quickly got dressed, impressed at how the garments fit her perfectly.</p><p>At the sound of her sword being sheathed, Podrick turned around. Stunned at the sight before him. She looked ethereal. She looked powerful.</p><p>Y/N tied her hair in an intricate braid. Putting her hands to her sides, she looked at the squire.</p><p>&ldquo;Lady Arya was right. I am a fighter.&rdquo;</p><p>Podrick and Y/N smiled at the woman&rsquo;s words.</p><p>&ldquo;Now Pod, can you show me where the Khaleesi will be?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Of course, Y/N.&rdquo;</p><p>He escorted her towards the door, closing it behind them.</p><p>The pair twist and turned down the corridors until they approach a large, heavy-set steel door. </p><p>Muffled voices could be heard as they approached.</p><p>&ldquo;The Khaleesi is very important to you?&rdquo; asked Podrick.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, and I would hope I am important to her as well.&rdquo;</p><p>They stopped at the doors. The voices on the other side had become increasingly louder. She could hear loud chattering and disgruntled voices.</p><p>&ldquo;Why is that?&rdquo; Podrick questioned.</p><p>Y/N smiled, gesturing him to open the doors.</p><p>As the doors creaked open she spoke.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I am her wife.&rdquo;</p><p>Ignoring the shocked appearance of Podrick she strolled into the hall, Podrick not far behind her.</p><p>The noise was still very loud. So loud they had not even heard the doors open and close.</p><p>She could hear the voice of a women/</p><p>&ldquo;What do dragons eat anyway?&rdquo;</p><p>Another replied.</p><p>&ldquo;Whatever they want.&rdquo;</p><p>Ah. There was her Daenerys.</p><p>Rolling her eyes, she tried to push through the crowds of lords; to no avail. </p><p>She looked at Podrick. Pulling out her sword, she laid the tip on the ground.</p><p>&ldquo;Follow me and cover your ears, Pod. This sound will go right through you.&rdquo;</p><p>He did as she instructed. </p><p>Y/N began to scrape the sword across the stone floor. </p><p>The arguing of the Lords ceased, only to be replaced by their groans of pain. For all covered their ears at the piercing noise, moving out of the way of its direction. Y/N&rsquo;s path was now clear as she walked through the group of men, her sword still trailing behind her. The lords stepping out of the way, watching as she walked into the centre of the room; with Podrick close on her tale. Once she had arrived to the centre, she pulled her sword in front of her; ceasing the noise. </p><p>Silence embedded the room. Jon and the Khaleesi could not believe their eyes.</p><p>Y/N pointed at Jon. A smirk on her face.</p><p>&ldquo;Told you the sound goes right through you.&rdquo;</p><p>All eyes fell to the Khaleesi at the sound of her standing from her chair; the item toppling to the floor.</p><p>The pair stared at one another.</p><p>Daenerys slowly walked around the table, standing a few feet away from Y/N.</p><p>&ldquo;How did you survive? Jon said he saw you drown?&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N laughed at the Khaleesi&rsquo;s words.</p><p>&ldquo;I did. But some blue Northern bloke saved me.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon knew she spoke of his uncle Benjen. For he had saved Jon as well.<br />Y/N turned her gaze and body to Sansa. Kneeling down quickly, she arose soon after.</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you, Lady Sansa for providing me warmth, shelter, food, and clothes. For not turning me away in my hour of need.&rdquo;</p><p>Whilst Sansa held a grudge against Daenerys, she could not help a small smile appear at Y/N&rsquo;s gratitude. </p><p>Daenerys watched the exchange. </p><p>Quickly looking towards Podrick, with the man still standing close behind her, she smiled.</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you, Pod. You have been amazing help. I have made a friend for life in you.&rdquo;</p><p>Podrick could not help but blush at her words. Moving towards the side, Podrick smiled back at the woman.</p><p>Finally turning back towards her queen, Y/N stepped forwards. </p><p>A serious expression took over Y/N&rsquo;s face.</p><p>&ldquo;I am sorry to have worried you. I should not have left Dragonstone. I should have stayed with you.&rdquo;</p><p>Daenerys shook her head, stepping closer as well.</p><p>&ldquo;No. You fulfilled your role as Commander of the Targaryen armies. And you fulfilled your promise of coming back to me.&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N smiled.</p><p>&ldquo;I always come back, don&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;</p><p>Daenerys rolled her eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh hush.&rdquo;</p><p>Daenerys slammed her lips onto Y/N&rsquo;s. Their last kiss being all those months ago, when she had sailed to fight the whites. Now she was back, in Daenerys&rsquo; arms, read to fight them once more. </p><p>The pair broke apart at the sound of the hollers of the lords. </p><p>Stepping away from the Khaleesi, Y/N turned towards the room, unsheathing her sword as a warning. Her glare piercing through many of them men. The room quietened once more. Turning back to her queen, she put away her sword.</p><p>The Stark siblings could not help but smile at the woman&rsquo;s actions. Whilst Arya and Sansa held resentment towards the Queen, they could not help but admire the ferociousness of her partner. Jon was happy to see the woman alive. For he knew she would be an important asset towards the oncoming battle.</p><p>Winking at the Khaleesi, Y/N bowed towards Jon and Sansa, moving to stand by Podrick. He elbowed her side, making the woman laugh.</p><p>Daenerys smiled at the interaction. Moving back towards her seat, she sat down. <br />The Khaleesi addressed the room.</p><p>&ldquo;Time to prepare for war.&rdquo;<br /></p><p><b>A/N- I hope you enjoyed it <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/macQgH5Em2WOamh_jQLHgnQ\">@path-of-fire</a> If anyone has anymore requests feel free to send.&nbsp;</b></p></p>",

A small smile gracing her face. &nbsp;The pair watched as Jon and his men prepared the boats, ready to go beyond the wall.</p>\n<p>Turning towards her Khaleesi, Y/N gently grabbed her face. Feeling the worry roll off of her in waves, Y/N leaned in to kiss Daenerys. Her lips moved across her lovers, as Daenerys&rsquo; arms encircled the woman&rsquo;s waist. Pulling her as close as possible.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Are they always like this?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Jorah laughed at Jon&rsquo;s comment. </p>\n<p>Walking to stand next to the young man, he clapped a hand on his shoulder.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;That woman has travelled farther and wider for Daenerys than even I have. Than anyone has.

Given that Euron Greyjoy, Daenerys Stormborn, and the Night King all sport this, it is safe to say that Team Storm are the main villains.\u00a0</b></p><p>The Crypts of Winterfell teaser provided us the real heroes of this season and they are these three:</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1280\" data-orig-height=\"720\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/07926b5ff6c01658f7d7bfd572266c01/tumblr_inline_pqsx3214DH1s6u549_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1280\" data-orig-height=\"720\"/></figure><p><b>Jon Snow, Sansa Stark, and Arya Stark, poised to face the threats of Ice and Fire with their best weapons, and are the real heroes of Season 8 and the story at large.</b></p><p>Longclaw for Jon, Sansa has her wits and charm, intelligence, and realpolitik, I mean I could go on but you get the point. Last but not the least, Arya Stark, newly minted Night King Slayer, with her Valyrian steel dagger, with which she killed the NK and Needle.</p><p>Thanks to Arya being the NK Slayer, this picture makes a whole lot of sense now and I believe we will have Jon and Sansa take down the other two villains in the story. 3 villains vs 3 heroes.</p><h2><b>Daenerys Stormborn:</b></h2><p>The show actually teased that Jon and Sansa will stand against Daenerys Stormborn back in Season 6.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1k0YsrTBEYM\">S06E09 Battle of the Bastards Inside the Episode</a> commentary by David Benioff, where he says:</p><blockquote><p><b><i>\u201cIf you are one of the Lords of Westeros or one of her potential opponents in the wars to come, and you get word of what happened here in Meereen, you have to be pretty nervous because this is an unprecedented threat. </i></b>You\u2019ve got a woman who has somehow formed an alliance where she\u2019s got a Dothraki horde, a legion of Unsullied, she\u2019s got the mercenary army of the Second Sons, and she\u2019s got three dragons, who are now pretty close to full-grown. <b><i>So if she can make it all the way across the Narrow Sea and get to Westeros, who\u2019s gonna stand in her way?\u201d</i></b><br/></p></blockquote><p>over shots of Daenerys about to destroy Meereen and burning people, is immediately followed by this shot of Sansa and Jon, from the tent scene, prior to Battle of Bastards, where they discuss how to defeat Ramsay (another villain).</p><figure data-orig-width=\"480\" data-orig-height=\"270\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d44fa6e6189ef3fd3e4e7dad9d93ea48/tumblr_inline_pqzq29bcTp1s6u549_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"480\" data-orig-height=\"270\"/></figure><p>Sneaky.</p><p>In Season 8 so far, we have seen Sansa go toe-to-toe with Daenerys, either by making her displeasure known in feeding the\u00a0\u201cgreatest army the world has ever seen\u201d with the limited food and resources that Sansa has managed to gather for the North, or derisively asking\u00a0\u201cwhat do dragons eat anyway\u201d or outright defying Daenerys in Jamie\u2019s trial. I do not see this abating in the upcoming episodes. Sansa knows that the Dragon Queen is a threat to her home, her family, and the entire North and she will be using her smarts and political prowess to outplay Daenerys.</p><p>Jon, on the other hand, will be the one to go fight Daenerys in a Dance of the Dragons 2.0. Whether Jon kills Daenerys remains to be seen. The show has buried enough clues to allude to this happening. I have written about it <a href=\"https://mebongster87.tumblr.com/post/181110488463/a-trail-of-trailers-dd-have-been-hinting-at-dark\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://mebongster87.tumblr.com/post/181149084973/house-stark-video-breakdown-s8-predictions?is_related_post=1\">here</a>\u00a0and I think there is a strong possibility that Jon kills Daenerys, irrespective of your beliefs in those alleged leaks.\u00a0</p><p>In fact, these lines from ADWD, Jon XII, may have foreshadowed this:</p><blockquote><p>Burning shafts hissed upward, trailing tongues of fire. Scarecrow brothers tumbled down, black cloaks ablaze.\u00a0</p><p>&ldquo;Snow,&rdquo; an eagle cried, as foemen scuttled up the ice like spiders.\u00a0</p><p><b>Jon was armored in black ice, but his blade burned red in his fist</b>. As the dead men reached the top of the Wall he sent them down to die again. <b>He slew</b> a greybeard and a beardless boy, a giant, a gaunt man with filed teeth, <b>a girl with thick red hair. Too late he recognized Ygritte. She was gone as quick as she&rsquo;d appeared.\u00a0</b>The world dissolved into a red mist. Jon stabbed and slashed and cut. He hacked down Donal Noye and gutted Deaf Dick Follard. Qhorin Halfhand stumbled to his knees, trying in vain to staunch the flow of blood from his neck. <b>&ldquo;I am the Lord of Winterfell,&rdquo; Jon screamed. It was Robb before him now, his hair wet with melting snow. Longclaw took his head off. </b>Then a gnarled hand seized Jon roughly by the shoulder. He whirled \u2026\u2026 and woke with a raven pecking at his chest.\u00a0<br/></p></blockquote><p>Here we have <b>Jon armored in black ice,</b> which is very reminiscent of Daenerys\u2019 dream from ASOS, Daenerys III:</p><blockquote><p>That night she dreamt that she was Rhaegar, riding to the Trident. But she was mounted on a dragon, not a horse. <b>When she saw the Usurper&rsquo;s rebel host across the river they were armored all in ice, but she bathed them in dragonfire and they melted away like dew and turned the Trident into a torrent. </b>Some small part of her knew that she was dreaming, but another part exulted. This is how it was meant to be. The other was a nightmare, and I have only now awakened.<br/></p></blockquote><p><b>Jon kills Ygritte, a love interest, and Robb, his kin/cousin within the same dream. Daenerys is both a love interest and his kin/aunt.\u00a0</b></p><p>Jon has also been referred to as the\u00a0<b>\u201cshifting shadow\u201d </b>from Daenerys\u2019s chapters&hellip;ASOS, Daenerys II.</p><blockquote><p>\u201cSometimes she would close her eyes and dream of him, but it was never Jorah Mormont she dreamed of; her lover was always younger and more comely, though his face remained a <b>shifting</b> <b>shadow</b>.\u201c<br/></p></blockquote><p>Melisandre in her visions sees Jon as a shifting shadow as well:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cThe flames crackled softly, and in their crackling she heard the whispered name <b>Jon Snow.</b> His long face floated before her, limned in tongues of red and orange, appearing and disappearing again, a <b>shadow</b> half-seen behind a fluttering curtain. Now he was a man, now a wolf, now a man again.\u201d<br/></p><p>-ADWD, Melisandre I.</p></blockquote><p>What\u2019s interesting is that the show actually uses a\u00a0\u201cshadow\u201d to allude to Jon.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"320\" data-orig-height=\"180\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/22a25d47cd399401dc0f052acc9c9985/tumblr_inline_pqzsjomV4D1s6u549_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"320\" data-orig-height=\"180\"/></figure><p>Notice the focus on the <b>shadow of Jon</b>, right before he goes to behead Janos Slynt, someone who betrayed Ned Stark and was an enemy to House Stark. And dare I say, this reminds me of the shadow of Jamie from Bran\u2019s visions right before he shoves the sword in the back of the Mad King Aerys.\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1185\" data-orig-height=\"730\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/09a69efd430b1174aa4f1c827bac54ee/tumblr_inline_pqzszkVQws1s6u549_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1185\" data-orig-height=\"730\"/></figure><p>Since Jon and Jamie are foils, Jon could end the story as a kinslayer and Queenslayer, just as Jamie started the story as the Kingslayer. We shall see whether it does come to pass or not. Additionally, Jon has refused to kill a woman twice before (Ygritte and Melisandre), maybe he ends up having to kill a woman this third time. Notably, Ygritte was a love interest, Melisandre tried seducing Jon, and now he is in a relationship with Daenerys.\u00a0 \u00a0</p><h2><b>Euron Greyjoy:</b></h2><p>I would\u2019ve loved for Theon to be the one to take down Euron but since he is dead, someone else will have to step up to bring this guy down.</p><p>Could Jon be the one? Or Arya?Or Yara?</p><p><b>Since both Euron and Daenerys have been associated with\u00a0\u201cStorm\u201d, here are some clues that I found that I thought were interesting.</b></p><p><b>This next part is just wild speculation on my part.\u00a0</b></p><p>Euron is introduced to us in <b>S06E02 Home<i>,</i></b> where he kills his brother and King Balon Greyjoy and these are some of the things he says&hellip;</p><figure data-orig-width=\"480\" data-orig-height=\"270\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/0dac789867bdb6177fe613c4a7bf8e46/tumblr_inline_pqsxtygHPW1s6u549_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"480\" data-orig-height=\"270\"/></figure><figure data-orig-width=\"480\" data-orig-height=\"270\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d954bb0c84537e5e0d845f3ceb96c489/tumblr_inline_pqsxygmFFj1s6u549_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"480\" data-orig-height=\"270\"/></figure><p>And this is what Jon says before he gets crowned KITN in <b>S06E10 The Winds of Winter.</b>..</p><figure data-orig-width=\"480\" data-orig-height=\"270\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/81607a6b679b460b6f78693cd37e65e3/tumblr_inline_pqsy4xGhEG1s6u549_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"480\" data-orig-height=\"270\"/></figure><p>Littlefinger needles him in the crypts before Jon leaves for Dragonstone in <b>S07E02 Stormborn </b>and says this&hellip;</p><figure data-orig-width=\"480\" data-orig-height=\"270\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/94043bbc3a0012f33aebcebe24236221/tumblr_inline_pqsy97dmGV1s6u549_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"480\" data-orig-height=\"270\"/></figure><p>While Daenerys Stormborn has been associated with storms, Euron has been called the Storm and in this same episode called <b>Stormborn</b>, we see both Daenerys and Euron but not the Night King.

To which Euron talks about sailing his fleet elsewhere??To Dragonstone maybe??? I believe the show is cluing us to the fact that Euron could possibly switch camps. I mean he is wild, unpredictable and who knows what his next move is??\u00a0However, he wants to marry the most beautiful woman in the world and just wants to side with the winning team.</p><p>In the promo for Episode 4, we see Euron going down on his knees and looks like he is proposing Cersei. If Cersei rejects his proposal, maybe he will switch sides over to Daenerys, whom he thinks has a better chance of winning and is the most beautiful woman in the world.</p><p>However, in the subtext, do we really think Daenerys\u2019s side is the winning side????</p><p>If she is the main antagonist, then she has to lose, right? So what could this mean&hellip;.that Euron switches Cersei\u2019s camp and goes over to Daenerys\u2019s camp thinking he is picking the winning side, only to end up on the losing side, when Daenerys finally loses.\u00a0</p><p>Euron is a wild card and hopefully, next episode provides some solid clues regarding what\u2019s going to happen.</p><p>There is also this scene from <b>S07E05 Eastwatch</b>, where the maesters of the Citadel are discussing Bran\u2019s letter about the AOTD and one of the maesters mockingly says&hellip;<b>\u201dDon\u2019t forget the prophet Lodos, who said that the drowned god will rise up and destroy Aegon the Conqueror\u201d</b></p><figure data-orig-width=\"480\" data-orig-height=\"270\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/52dc00c925e04f414c3efc0d5d1ec941/tumblr_inline_pqsyusGYXU1s6u549_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"480\" data-orig-height=\"270\"/></figure><p><b>Prophecy twist is when Aegon the Protector aka Jon Snow who has risen from the dead, destroys the Drowned God aka Euron Greyjoy.</b></p><p><b>Or the Drowned God aka Euron Greyjoy allies himself with Aegon the Conqueror come again aka Daenerys Stormborn to attempt to destroy KL???? </b>It remains to be seen.</p><p>Why will Jon need to kill Euron???

And <a href=\"https://mebongster87.tumblr.com/post/182385181443/friendly-reminder-that-jon-snow-said-this-in\">Jon</a> has already said (to LF)\u00a0<b>\u201cTouch my sister and I\u2019ll kill you myself\u201d.</b> That Chekhov\u2019s gun is still waiting to go off.</p><p>I can\u2019t help but think that the scene in the godswood in S08E01 Winterfell, in front of the heart tree, when Arya and Jon reunite and they talk about Sansa and Jon says that\u00a0<b>\u201cI am her family too\u201d</b>, Arya says\u00a0<b>\u201cdon\u2019t forget that\u201d </b>is foreshadowing for Jon to remember his first vow after he was brought back from the death that he made to Sansa&hellip;<b>\u201dI won\u2019t ever let him touch you again, I will protect you, I promise\u201d</b>. Jon\u2019s vow to protect Sansa will come into play in a moment when Sansa\u2019s safety and her life is compromised. If Euron/GC come for her, then Jon\u2019s vows to protect Sansa are applicable here as well.\u00a0</p><p>This Jon/Arya scene then transitions to a shot of KL, where we think Sansa will get kidnapped to, and then we have shots of Cersei and Qyburn, the Golden Company with Euron and, finally we have scenes where a \u201csister\u201d is held captive by Euron. And who comes to rescue his \u201csister\u201d Yara?? Theon, who is a foil to Jon&hellip;I think these are interesting scene transitions. Again, since it\u2019s rescuing one\u2019s sister, it could be that Arya is the one who comes to rescue Sansa, together with Jon, and ends up being the one to kill Euron.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"2100\" data-orig-height=\"1500\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/69bb86eacda091217f0a065efed11050/tumblr_inline_pqt0yrLbrA1s6u549_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"2100\" data-orig-height=\"1500\"/></figure><p>Having said all of that, I am really not sure. Mainly because I don\u2019t think the show will let Jon kill both Euron and Daenerys. That\u2019s a bit much for one guy, even if it\u2019s Jon. And this is primarily where I think Arya may play a part and be the one to kill Euron. If Jon kills Daenerys, then Arya will kill Euron, again the objective remains the same, protect Sansa. That shot from the crypts teaser where Sansa is flanked by Arya one on side and Jon on the other side, with their weapons drawn in a protective stance, makes me think that both Jon and Arya will have to protect and save Sansa at some point.<br/></p><p>Or the show could give this kill to Yara, Jamie, or even Brienne, who knows. Like I said, this part is pure speculation on my part so I could be totally wrong.</p><h2><b>And finally Cersei Lannister:</b></h2><p>I am counting on the show giving us a Sansa vs Cersei showdown, I feel like those two characters need to meet to complete the YMBQ story arc.\u00a0<br/></p><p>If the kidnapping plot does not happen, Sansa could come to KL to parlay with Cersei to strike up an alliance to take down Daenerys and defend the 7Ks.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"737\" data-orig-height=\"485\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/779220dda5cd57b9a794a0dbac22f1c3/tumblr_inline_pqzw2zFzsV1s6u549_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"737\" data-orig-height=\"485\"/></figure><figure data-orig-width=\"480\" data-orig-height=\"480\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/3f7481a892d2b5fb00876123549cf1de/tumblr_inline_pqzw4gdjvl1s6u549_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"480\" data-orig-height=\"480\"/></figure><p>These character posters have the same energy about them.

The Golden Company will fight on behalf of Cersei and Sansa against Daenerys\u2019s (and maybe Euron\u2019s) armies.</p><p>In terms of Cersei\u2019s demise, I am not putting too much stock on the Valonqar prophecy being actually true. Yes, Cersei has to die eventually, but D&amp;D are Lena fanboys and I don\u2019t think they will give her a gruesome on-camera death. In fact, I think Cersei will commit suicide or maybe poisoned.</p><p>When cornered, Cersei has either always managed to pull out an ace in the hole and outwit all her opponents in one fell-swoop like she did with House Tyrell in S06E10 when she blew up the sept\u00a0</p><p>OR\u00a0</p><p>she turns suicidal and threatens to do something rash.</p><p>Case in point:</p><p>1.

When Tywin was forcing her to marry Loras, she threatened to\u00a0\u201cburn our House to the ground\u201d.</p><p>The only thing Cersei loves is her children, Jamie, and her throne. The fact that she is drinking wine again means that she probably is no longer pregnant. Jamie, if he ends up with Brienne, is gone from her. Her throne is under attack from Daenerys\u2019s forces. All of these may just force her to do:</p><figure data-orig-width=\"480\" data-orig-height=\"270\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/f26b4043e09d1c5e3b1dec13601a7faf/tumblr_inline_pqzwvxuQgC1s6u549_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"480\" data-orig-height=\"270\"/></figure><p>Foreshadowing from S03E10 Mhysa, where she is talking to Tyrion to give Sansa a child so that she may have some happiness.</p><p>She does not have any more children left, so she may just throw herself from the highest window in the red keep.</p><p>Joffrey and Myrcella were poisoned, Tommen committed suicide by throwing himself from his window.

            "comment": "<p>Back when the character posters for Season 8 was released, a few folks in the JonSa fandom speculated about how Daenerys, Euron Greyjoy, and the Night King, were shown to be seated on the Iron Throne with the <a href=\"https://mebongster87.tumblr.com/post/183296685263/the-kubrick-stare\">Stanley Kubrick glare.</a>\u00a0Here are the pictures of what I am talking about.\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1478\" data-orig-height=\"737\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/68628e09cc61a4a77520d2f4c05648f0/tumblr_inline_pqswskVQMp1s6u549_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1478\" data-orig-height=\"737\"></figure><p><b>Kubrick stare is a typical characterising feature of villainy.

Last but not the least, Arya Stark, newly minted Night King Slayer, with her Valyrian steel dagger, with which she killed the NK and Needle.</p><p>Thanks to Arya being the NK Slayer, this picture makes a whole lot of sense now and I believe we will have Jon and Sansa take down the other two villains in the story. 3 villains vs 3 heroes.</p><h2><b>Daenerys Stormborn:</b></h2><p>The show actually teased that Jon and Sansa will stand against Daenerys Stormborn back in Season 6.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1k0YsrTBEYM\">S06E09 Battle of the Bastards Inside the Episode</a> commentary by David Benioff, where he says:</p><blockquote><p><b><i>\u201cIf you are one of the Lords of Westeros or one of her potential opponents in the wars to come, and you get word of what happened here in Meereen, you have to be pretty nervous because this is an unprecedented threat. </i></b>You\u2019ve got a woman who has somehow formed an alliance where she\u2019s got a Dothraki horde, a legion of Unsullied, she\u2019s got the mercenary army of the Second Sons, and she\u2019s got three dragons, who are now pretty close to full-grown. <b><i>So if she can make it all the way across the Narrow Sea and get to Westeros, who\u2019s gonna stand in her way?\u201d</i></b><br></p></blockquote><p>over shots of Daenerys about to destroy Meereen and burning people, is immediately followed by this shot of Sansa and Jon, from the tent scene, prior to Battle of Bastards, where they discuss how to defeat Ramsay (another villain).</p><figure data-orig-width=\"480\" data-orig-height=\"270\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d44fa6e6189ef3fd3e4e7dad9d93ea48/tumblr_inline_pqzq29bcTp1s6u549_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"480\" data-orig-height=\"270\"></figure><p>Sneaky.</p><p>In Season 8 so far, we have seen Sansa go toe-to-toe with Daenerys, either by making her displeasure known in feeding the\u00a0\u201cgreatest army the world has ever seen\u201d with the limited food and resources that Sansa has managed to gather for the North, or derisively asking\u00a0\u201cwhat do dragons eat anyway\u201d or outright defying Daenerys in Jamie\u2019s trial. I do not see this abating in the upcoming episodes. Sansa knows that the Dragon Queen is a threat to her home, her family, and the entire North and she will be using her smarts and political prowess to outplay Daenerys.</p><p>Jon, on the other hand, will be the one to go fight Daenerys in a Dance of the Dragons 2.0. Whether Jon kills Daenerys remains to be seen. The show has buried enough clues to allude to this happening. I have written about it <a href=\"https://mebongster87.tumblr.com/post/181110488463/a-trail-of-trailers-dd-have-been-hinting-at-dark\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://mebongster87.tumblr.com/post/181149084973/house-stark-video-breakdown-s8-predictions?is_related_post=1\">here</a>\u00a0and I think there is a strong possibility that Jon kills Daenerys, irrespective of your beliefs in those alleged leaks.\u00a0</p><p>In fact, these lines from ADWD, Jon XII, may have foreshadowed this:</p><blockquote><p>Burning shafts hissed upward, trailing tongues of fire. Scarecrow brothers tumbled down, black cloaks ablaze.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSnow,\u201d an eagle cried, as foemen scuttled up the ice like spiders.\u00a0</p><p><b>Jon was armored in black ice, but his blade burned red in his fist</b>. As the dead men reached the top of the Wall he sent them down to die again. <b>He slew</b> a greybeard and a beardless boy, a giant, a gaunt man with filed teeth, <b>a girl with thick red hair. Too late he recognized Ygritte. She was gone as quick as she\u2019d appeared.\u00a0</b>The world dissolved into a red mist. Jon stabbed and slashed and cut. He hacked down Donal Noye and gutted Deaf Dick Follard. Qhorin Halfhand stumbled to his knees, trying in vain to staunch the flow of blood from his neck. <b>\u201cI am the Lord of Winterfell,\u201d Jon screamed. It was Robb before him now, his hair wet with melting snow. Longclaw took his head off. </b>Then a gnarled hand seized Jon roughly by the shoulder. He whirled \u2026\u2026 and woke with a raven pecking at his chest.\u00a0<br></p></blockquote><p>Here we have <b>Jon armored in black ice,</b> which is very reminiscent of Daenerys\u2019 dream from ASOS, Daenerys III:</p><blockquote><p>That night she dreamt that she was Rhaegar, riding to the Trident. But she was mounted on a dragon, not a horse. <b>When she saw the Usurper\u2019s rebel host across the river they were armored all in ice, but she bathed them in dragonfire and they melted away like dew and turned the Trident into a torrent. </b>Some small part of her knew that she was dreaming, but another part exulted. This is how it was meant to be. The other was a nightmare, and I have only now awakened.<br></p></blockquote><p><b>Jon kills Ygritte, a love interest, and Robb, his kin/cousin within the same dream. Daenerys is both a love interest and his kin/aunt.\u00a0</b></p><p>Jon has also been referred to as the\u00a0<b>\u201cshifting shadow\u201d </b>from Daenerys\u2019s chapters\u2026ASOS, Daenerys II.</p><blockquote><p>\u201cSometimes she would close her eyes and dream of him, but it was never Jorah Mormont she dreamed of; her lover was always younger and more comely, though his face remained a <b>shifting</b> <b>shadow</b>.\u201c<br></p></blockquote><p>Melisandre in her visions sees Jon as a shifting shadow as well:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cThe flames crackled softly, and in their crackling she heard the whispered name <b>Jon Snow.</b> His long face floated before her, limned in tongues of red and orange, appearing and disappearing again, a <b>shadow</b> half-seen behind a fluttering curtain. Now he was a man, now a wolf, now a man again.\u201d<br></p><p>-ADWD, Melisandre I.</p></blockquote><p>What\u2019s interesting is that the show actually uses a\u00a0\u201cshadow\u201d to allude to Jon.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"320\" data-orig-height=\"180\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/22a25d47cd399401dc0f052acc9c9985/tumblr_inline_pqzsjomV4D1s6u549_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"320\" data-orig-height=\"180\"></figure><p>Notice the focus on the <b>shadow of Jon</b>, right before he goes to behead Janos Slynt, someone who betrayed Ned Stark and was an enemy to House Stark.

We shall see whether it does come to pass or not. Additionally, Jon has refused to kill a woman twice before (Ygritte and Melisandre), maybe he ends up having to kill a woman this third time. Notably, Ygritte was a love interest, Melisandre tried seducing Jon, and now he is in a relationship with Daenerys.\u00a0 \u00a0</p><h2><b>Euron Greyjoy:</b></h2><p>I would\u2019ve loved for Theon to be the one to take down Euron but since he is dead, someone else will have to step up to bring this guy down.</p><p>Could Jon be the one?

I mean he is wild, unpredictable and who knows what his next move is??\u00a0However, he wants to marry the most beautiful woman in the world and just wants to side with the winning team.</p><p>In the promo for Episode 4, we see Euron going down on his knees and looks like he is proposing Cersei. If Cersei rejects his proposal, maybe he will switch sides over to Daenerys, whom he thinks has a better chance of winning and is the most beautiful woman in the world.</p><p>However, in the subtext, do we really think Daenerys\u2019s side is the winning side????</p><p>If she is the main antagonist, then she has to lose, right?

Like I said, this part is pure speculation on my part so I could be totally wrong.</p><h2><b>And finally Cersei Lannister:</b></h2><p>I am counting on the show giving us a Sansa vs Cersei showdown, I feel like those two characters need to meet to complete the YMBQ story arc.\u00a0<br></p><p>If the kidnapping plot does not happen, Sansa could come to KL to parlay with Cersei to strike up an alliance to take down Daenerys and defend the 7Ks.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"737\" data-orig-height=\"485\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/779220dda5cd57b9a794a0dbac22f1c3/tumblr_inline_pqzw2zFzsV1s6u549_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"737\" data-orig-height=\"485\"></figure><figure data-orig-width=\"480\" data-orig-height=\"480\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/3f7481a892d2b5fb00876123549cf1de/tumblr_inline_pqzw4gdjvl1s6u549_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"480\" data-orig-height=\"480\"></figure><p>These character posters have the same energy about them.

The Golden Company will fight on behalf of Cersei and Sansa against Daenerys\u2019s (and maybe Euron\u2019s) armies.</p><p>In terms of Cersei\u2019s demise, I am not putting too much stock on the Valonqar prophecy being actually true. Yes, Cersei has to die eventually, but D&amp;D are Lena fanboys and I don\u2019t think they will give her a gruesome on-camera death. In fact, I think Cersei will commit suicide or maybe poisoned.</p><p>When cornered, Cersei has either always managed to pull out an ace in the hole and outwit all her opponents in one fell-swoop like she did with House Tyrell in S06E10 when she blew up the sept\u00a0</p><p>OR\u00a0</p><p>she turns suicidal and threatens to do something rash.</p><p>Case in point:</p><p>1.

The fact that she is drinking wine again means that she probably is no longer pregnant. Jamie, if he ends up with Brienne, is gone from her. Her throne is under attack from Daenerys\u2019s forces.

Last but not the least, Arya Stark, newly minted Night King Slayer, with her Valyrian steel dagger, with which she killed the NK and Needle.</p><p>Thanks to Arya being the NK Slayer, this picture makes a whole lot of sense now and I believe we will have Jon and Sansa take down the other two villains in the story. 3 villains vs 3 heroes.</p><h2><b>Daenerys Stormborn:</b></h2><p>The show actually teased that Jon and Sansa will stand against Daenerys Stormborn back in Season 6.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1k0YsrTBEYM\">S06E09 Battle of the Bastards Inside the Episode</a> commentary by David Benioff, where he says:</p><blockquote><p><b><i>\u201cIf you are one of the Lords of Westeros or one of her potential opponents in the wars to come, and you get word of what happened here in Meereen, you have to be pretty nervous because this is an unprecedented threat. </i></b>You\u2019ve got a woman who has somehow formed an alliance where she\u2019s got a Dothraki horde, a legion of Unsullied, she\u2019s got the mercenary army of the Second Sons, and she\u2019s got three dragons, who are now pretty close to full-grown. <b><i>So if she can make it all the way across the Narrow Sea and get to Westeros, who\u2019s gonna stand in her way?\u201d</i></b><br></p></blockquote><p>over shots of Daenerys about to destroy Meereen and burning people, is immediately followed by this shot of Sansa and Jon, from the tent scene, prior to Battle of Bastards, where they discuss how to defeat Ramsay (another villain).</p><figure data-orig-width=\"480\" data-orig-height=\"270\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d44fa6e6189ef3fd3e4e7dad9d93ea48/tumblr_inline_pqzq29bcTp1s6u549_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"480\" data-orig-height=\"270\"></figure><p>Sneaky.</p><p>In Season 8 so far, we have seen Sansa go toe-to-toe with Daenerys, either by making her displeasure known in feeding the\u00a0\u201cgreatest army the world has ever seen\u201d with the limited food and resources that Sansa has managed to gather for the North, or derisively asking\u00a0\u201cwhat do dragons eat anyway\u201d or outright defying Daenerys in Jamie\u2019s trial. I do not see this abating in the upcoming episodes. Sansa knows that the Dragon Queen is a threat to her home, her family, and the entire North and she will be using her smarts and political prowess to outplay Daenerys.</p><p>Jon, on the other hand, will be the one to go fight Daenerys in a Dance of the Dragons 2.0. Whether Jon kills Daenerys remains to be seen. The show has buried enough clues to allude to this happening. I have written about it <a href=\"https://mebongster87.tumblr.com/post/181110488463/a-trail-of-trailers-dd-have-been-hinting-at-dark\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://mebongster87.tumblr.com/post/181149084973/house-stark-video-breakdown-s8-predictions?is_related_post=1\">here</a>\u00a0and I think there is a strong possibility that Jon kills Daenerys, irrespective of your beliefs in those alleged leaks.\u00a0</p><p>In fact, these lines from ADWD, Jon XII, may have foreshadowed this:</p><blockquote><p>Burning shafts hissed upward, trailing tongues of fire. Scarecrow brothers tumbled down, black cloaks ablaze.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSnow,\u201d an eagle cried, as foemen scuttled up the ice like spiders.\u00a0</p><p><b>Jon was armored in black ice, but his blade burned red in his fist</b>. As the dead men reached the top of the Wall he sent them down to die again. <b>He slew</b> a greybeard and a beardless boy, a giant, a gaunt man with filed teeth, <b>a girl with thick red hair. Too late he recognized Ygritte. She was gone as quick as she\u2019d appeared.\u00a0</b>The world dissolved into a red mist. Jon stabbed and slashed and cut. He hacked down Donal Noye and gutted Deaf Dick Follard. Qhorin Halfhand stumbled to his knees, trying in vain to staunch the flow of blood from his neck. <b>\u201cI am the Lord of Winterfell,\u201d Jon screamed. It was Robb before him now, his hair wet with melting snow. Longclaw took his head off. </b>Then a gnarled hand seized Jon roughly by the shoulder. He whirled \u2026\u2026 and woke with a raven pecking at his chest.\u00a0<br></p></blockquote><p>Here we have <b>Jon armored in black ice,</b> which is very reminiscent of Daenerys\u2019 dream from ASOS, Daenerys III:</p><blockquote><p>That night she dreamt that she was Rhaegar, riding to the Trident. But she was mounted on a dragon, not a horse. <b>When she saw the Usurper\u2019s rebel host across the river they were armored all in ice, but she bathed them in dragonfire and they melted away like dew and turned the Trident into a torrent. </b>Some small part of her knew that she was dreaming, but another part exulted. This is how it was meant to be. The other was a nightmare, and I have only now awakened.<br></p></blockquote><p><b>Jon kills Ygritte, a love interest, and Robb, his kin/cousin within the same dream. Daenerys is both a love interest and his kin/aunt.\u00a0</b></p><p>Jon has also been referred to as the\u00a0<b>\u201cshifting shadow\u201d </b>from Daenerys\u2019s chapters\u2026ASOS, Daenerys II.</p><blockquote><p>\u201cSometimes she would close her eyes and dream of him, but it was never Jorah Mormont she dreamed of; her lover was always younger and more comely, though his face remained a <b>shifting</b> <b>shadow</b>.\u201c<br></p></blockquote><p>Melisandre in her visions sees Jon as a shifting shadow as well:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cThe flames crackled softly, and in their crackling she heard the whispered name <b>Jon Snow.</b> His long face floated before her, limned in tongues of red and orange, appearing and disappearing again, a <b>shadow</b> half-seen behind a fluttering curtain. Now he was a man, now a wolf, now a man again.\u201d<br></p><p>-ADWD, Melisandre I.</p></blockquote><p>What\u2019s interesting is that the show actually uses a\u00a0\u201cshadow\u201d to allude to Jon.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"320\" data-orig-height=\"180\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/22a25d47cd399401dc0f052acc9c9985/tumblr_inline_pqzsjomV4D1s6u549_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"320\" data-orig-height=\"180\"></figure><p>Notice the focus on the <b>shadow of Jon</b>, right before he goes to behead Janos Slynt, someone who betrayed Ned Stark and was an enemy to House Stark.

We shall see whether it does come to pass or not. Additionally, Jon has refused to kill a woman twice before (Ygritte and Melisandre), maybe he ends up having to kill a woman this third time. Notably, Ygritte was a love interest, Melisandre tried seducing Jon, and now he is in a relationship with Daenerys.\u00a0 \u00a0</p><h2><b>Euron Greyjoy:</b></h2><p>I would\u2019ve loved for Theon to be the one to take down Euron but since he is dead, someone else will have to step up to bring this guy down.</p><p>Could Jon be the one?

To which Euron talks about sailing his fleet elsewhere??To Dragonstone maybe??? I believe the show is cluing us to the fact that Euron could possibly switch camps. I mean he is wild, unpredictable and who knows what his next move is??\u00a0However, he wants to marry the most beautiful woman in the world and just wants to side with the winning team.</p><p>In the promo for Episode 4, we see Euron going down on his knees and looks like he is proposing Cersei. If Cersei rejects his proposal, maybe he will switch sides over to Daenerys, whom he thinks has a better chance of winning and is the most beautiful woman in the world.</p><p>However, in the subtext, do we really think Daenerys\u2019s side is the winning side????</p><p>If she is the main antagonist, then she has to lose, right? So what could this mean\u2026.that Euron switches Cersei\u2019s camp and goes over to Daenerys\u2019s camp thinking he is picking the winning side, only to end up on the losing side, when Daenerys finally loses.\u00a0</p><p>Euron is a wild card and hopefully, next episode provides some solid clues regarding what\u2019s going to happen.</p><p>There is also this scene from <b>S07E05 Eastwatch</b>, where the maesters of the Citadel are discussing Bran\u2019s letter about the AOTD and one of the maesters mockingly says\u2026<b>\u201dDon\u2019t forget the prophet Lodos, who said that the drowned god will rise up and destroy Aegon the Conqueror\u201d</b></p><figure data-orig-width=\"480\" data-orig-height=\"270\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/52dc00c925e04f414c3efc0d5d1ec941/tumblr_inline_pqsyusGYXU1s6u549_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"480\" data-orig-height=\"270\"></figure><p><b>Prophecy twist is when Aegon the Protector aka Jon Snow who has risen from the dead, destroys the Drowned God aka Euron Greyjoy.</b></p><p><b>Or the Drowned God aka Euron Greyjoy allies himself with Aegon the Conqueror come again aka Daenerys Stormborn to attempt to destroy KL???? </b>It remains to be seen.</p><p>Why will Jon need to kill Euron??? Maybe just maybe Euron will be involved in kidnapping Sansa to KL. And <a href=\"https://mebongster87.tumblr.com/post/182385181443/friendly-reminder-that-jon-snow-said-this-in\">Jon</a> has already said (to LF)\u00a0<b>\u201cTouch my sister and I\u2019ll kill you myself\u201d.</b> That Chekhov\u2019s gun is still waiting to go off.</p><p>I can\u2019t help but think that the scene in the godswood in S08E01 Winterfell, in front of the heart tree, when Arya and Jon reunite and they talk about Sansa and Jon says that\u00a0<b>\u201cI am her family too\u201d</b>, Arya says\u00a0<b>\u201cdon\u2019t forget that\u201d </b>is foreshadowing for Jon to remember his first vow after he was brought back from the death that he made to Sansa\u2026<b>\u201dI won\u2019t ever let him touch you again, I will protect you, I promise\u201d</b>. Jon\u2019s vow to protect Sansa will come into play in a moment when Sansa\u2019s safety and her life is compromised. If Euron/GC come for her, then Jon\u2019s vows to protect Sansa are applicable here as well.\u00a0</p><p>This Jon/Arya scene then transitions to a shot of KL, where we think Sansa will get kidnapped to, and then we have shots of Cersei and Qyburn, the Golden Company with Euron and, finally we have scenes where a \u201csister\u201d is held captive by Euron. And who comes to rescue his \u201csister\u201d Yara?? Theon, who is a foil to Jon\u2026I think these are interesting scene transitions. Again, since it\u2019s rescuing one\u2019s sister, it could be that Arya is the one who comes to rescue Sansa, together with Jon, and ends up being the one to kill Euron.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"2100\" data-orig-height=\"1500\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/69bb86eacda091217f0a065efed11050/tumblr_inline_pqt0yrLbrA1s6u549_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"2100\" data-orig-height=\"1500\"></figure><p>Having said all of that, I am really not sure. Mainly because I don\u2019t think the show will let Jon kill both Euron and Daenerys. That\u2019s a bit much for one guy, even if it\u2019s Jon.

                "content": "<p>Back when the character posters for Season 8 was released, a few folks in the JonSa fandom speculated about how Daenerys, Euron Greyjoy, and the Night King, were shown to be seated on the Iron Throne with the <a href=\"https://mebongster87.tumblr.com/post/183296685263/the-kubrick-stare\">Stanley Kubrick glare.</a>&nbsp;Here are the pictures of what I am talking about.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/68628e09cc61a4a77520d2f4c05648f0/tumblr_inline_pqswskVQMp1s6u549_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p><b>Kubrick stare is a typical characterising feature of villainy.

Last but not the least, Arya Stark, newly minted Night King Slayer, with her Valyrian steel dagger, with which she killed the NK and Needle.</p><p>Thanks to Arya being the NK Slayer, this picture makes a whole lot of sense now and I believe we will have Jon and Sansa take down the other two villains in the story. 3 villains vs 3 heroes.</p><h2><b>Daenerys Stormborn:</b></h2><p>The show actually teased that Jon and Sansa will stand against Daenerys Stormborn back in Season 6.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1k0YsrTBEYM\">S06E09 Battle of the Bastards Inside the Episode</a> commentary by David Benioff, where he says:</p><blockquote><p><b><i>&ldquo;If you are one of the Lords of Westeros or one of her potential opponents in the wars to come, and you get word of what happened here in Meereen, you have to be pretty nervous because this is an unprecedented threat. </i></b>You&rsquo;ve got a woman who has somehow formed an alliance where she&rsquo;s got a Dothraki horde, a legion of Unsullied, she&rsquo;s got the mercenary army of the Second Sons, and she&rsquo;s got three dragons, who are now pretty close to full-grown. <b><i>So if she can make it all the way across the Narrow Sea and get to Westeros, who&rsquo;s gonna stand in her way?&rdquo;</i></b><br /></p></blockquote><p>over shots of Daenerys about to destroy Meereen and burning people, is immediately followed by this shot of Sansa and Jon, from the tent scene, prior to Battle of Bastards, where they discuss how to defeat Ramsay (another villain).</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d44fa6e6189ef3fd3e4e7dad9d93ea48/tumblr_inline_pqzq29bcTp1s6u549_540.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Sneaky.</p><p>In Season 8 so far, we have seen Sansa go toe-to-toe with Daenerys, either by making her displeasure known in feeding the&nbsp;&ldquo;greatest army the world has ever seen&rdquo; with the limited food and resources that Sansa has managed to gather for the North, or derisively asking&nbsp;&ldquo;what do dragons eat anyway&rdquo; or outright defying Daenerys in Jamie&rsquo;s trial. I do not see this abating in the upcoming episodes. Sansa knows that the Dragon Queen is a threat to her home, her family, and the entire North and she will be using her smarts and political prowess to outplay Daenerys.</p><p>Jon, on the other hand, will be the one to go fight Daenerys in a Dance of the Dragons 2.0. Whether Jon kills Daenerys remains to be seen. The show has buried enough clues to allude to this happening. I have written about it <a href=\"https://mebongster87.tumblr.com/post/181110488463/a-trail-of-trailers-dd-have-been-hinting-at-dark\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://mebongster87.tumblr.com/post/181149084973/house-stark-video-breakdown-s8-predictions?is_related_post=1\">here</a>&nbsp;and I think there is a strong possibility that Jon kills Daenerys, irrespective of your beliefs in those alleged leaks.&nbsp;</p><p>In fact, these lines from ADWD, Jon XII, may have foreshadowed this:</p><blockquote><p>Burning shafts hissed upward, trailing tongues of fire. Scarecrow brothers tumbled down, black cloaks ablaze.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Snow,&rdquo; an eagle cried, as foemen scuttled up the ice like spiders.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Jon was armored in black ice, but his blade burned red in his fist</b>. As the dead men reached the top of the Wall he sent them down to die again. <b>He slew</b> a greybeard and a beardless boy, a giant, a gaunt man with filed teeth, <b>a girl with thick red hair. Too late he recognized Ygritte. She was gone as quick as she&rsquo;d appeared.&nbsp;</b>The world dissolved into a red mist. Jon stabbed and slashed and cut. He hacked down Donal Noye and gutted Deaf Dick Follard. Qhorin Halfhand stumbled to his knees, trying in vain to staunch the flow of blood from his neck. <b>&ldquo;I am the Lord of Winterfell,&rdquo; Jon screamed. It was Robb before him now, his hair wet with melting snow. Longclaw took his head off. </b>Then a gnarled hand seized Jon roughly by the shoulder. He whirled &hellip;&hellip; and woke with a raven pecking at his chest.&nbsp;<br /></p></blockquote><p>Here we have <b>Jon armored in black ice,</b> which is very reminiscent of Daenerys&rsquo; dream from ASOS, Daenerys III:</p><blockquote><p>That night she dreamt that she was Rhaegar, riding to the Trident. But she was mounted on a dragon, not a horse. <b>When she saw the Usurper&rsquo;s rebel host across the river they were armored all in ice, but she bathed them in dragonfire and they melted away like dew and turned the Trident into a torrent. </b>Some small part of her knew that she was dreaming, but another part exulted. This is how it was meant to be. The other was a nightmare, and I have only now awakened.<br /></p></blockquote><p><b>Jon kills Ygritte, a love interest, and Robb, his kin/cousin within the same dream. Daenerys is both a love interest and his kin/aunt.&nbsp;</b></p><p>Jon has also been referred to as the&nbsp;<b>&ldquo;shifting shadow&rdquo; </b>from Daenerys&rsquo;s chapters&hellip;ASOS, Daenerys II.</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Sometimes she would close her eyes and dream of him, but it was never Jorah Mormont she dreamed of; her lover was always younger and more comely, though his face remained a <b>shifting</b> <b>shadow</b>.&ldquo;<br /></p></blockquote><p>Melisandre in her visions sees Jon as a shifting shadow as well:</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;The flames crackled softly, and in their crackling she heard the whispered name <b>Jon Snow.</b> His long face floated before her, limned in tongues of red and orange, appearing and disappearing again, a <b>shadow</b> half-seen behind a fluttering curtain. Now he was a man, now a wolf, now a man again.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>-ADWD, Melisandre I.</p></blockquote><p>What&rsquo;s interesting is that the show actually uses a&nbsp;&ldquo;shadow&rdquo; to allude to Jon.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/22a25d47cd399401dc0f052acc9c9985/tumblr_inline_pqzsjomV4D1s6u549_540.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Notice the focus on the <b>shadow of Jon</b>, right before he goes to behead Janos Slynt, someone who betrayed Ned Stark and was an enemy to House Stark. And dare I say, this reminds me of the shadow of Jamie from Bran&rsquo;s visions right before he shoves the sword in the back of the Mad King Aerys.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/09a69efd430b1174aa4f1c827bac54ee/tumblr_inline_pqzszkVQws1s6u549_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Since Jon and Jamie are foils, Jon could end the story as a kinslayer and Queenslayer, just as Jamie started the story as the Kingslayer. We shall see whether it does come to pass or not. Additionally, Jon has refused to kill a woman twice before (Ygritte and Melisandre), maybe he ends up having to kill a woman this third time. Notably, Ygritte was a love interest, Melisandre tried seducing Jon, and now he is in a relationship with Daenerys.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><h2><b>Euron Greyjoy:</b></h2><p>I would&rsquo;ve loved for Theon to be the one to take down Euron but since he is dead, someone else will have to step up to bring this guy down.</p><p>Could Jon be the one? Or Arya?Or Yara?</p><p><b>Since both Euron and Daenerys have been associated with&nbsp;&ldquo;Storm&rdquo;, here are some clues that I found that I thought were interesting.</b></p><p><b>This next part is just wild speculation on my part.&nbsp;</b></p><p>Euron is introduced to us in <b>S06E02 Home<i>,</i></b> where he kills his brother and King Balon Greyjoy and these are some of the things he says&hellip;</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/0dac789867bdb6177fe613c4a7bf8e46/tumblr_inline_pqsxtygHPW1s6u549_540.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d954bb0c84537e5e0d845f3ceb96c489/tumblr_inline_pqsxygmFFj1s6u549_540.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>And this is what Jon says before he gets crowned KITN in <b>S06E10 The Winds of Winter.</b>..</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/81607a6b679b460b6f78693cd37e65e3/tumblr_inline_pqsy4xGhEG1s6u549_540.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Littlefinger needles him in the crypts before Jon leaves for Dragonstone in <b>S07E02 Stormborn </b>and says this&hellip;</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/94043bbc3a0012f33aebcebe24236221/tumblr_inline_pqsy97dmGV1s6u549_540.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>While Daenerys Stormborn has been associated with storms, Euron has been called the Storm and in this same episode called <b>Stormborn</b>, we see both Daenerys and Euron but not the Night King.

To which Euron talks about sailing his fleet elsewhere??To Dragonstone maybe??? I believe the show is cluing us to the fact that Euron could possibly switch camps. I mean he is wild, unpredictable and who knows what his next move is??&nbsp;However, he wants to marry the most beautiful woman in the world and just wants to side with the winning team.</p><p>In the promo for Episode 4, we see Euron going down on his knees and looks like he is proposing Cersei. If Cersei rejects his proposal, maybe he will switch sides over to Daenerys, whom he thinks has a better chance of winning and is the most beautiful woman in the world.</p><p>However, in the subtext, do we really think Daenerys&rsquo;s side is the winning side????</p><p>If she is the main antagonist, then she has to lose, right? So what could this mean&hellip;.that Euron switches Cersei&rsquo;s camp and goes over to Daenerys&rsquo;s camp thinking he is picking the winning side, only to end up on the losing side, when Daenerys finally loses.&nbsp;</p><p>Euron is a wild card and hopefully, next episode provides some solid clues regarding what&rsquo;s going to happen.</p><p>There is also this scene from <b>S07E05 Eastwatch</b>, where the maesters of the Citadel are discussing Bran&rsquo;s letter about the AOTD and one of the maesters mockingly says&hellip;<b>&rdquo;Don&rsquo;t forget the prophet Lodos, who said that the drowned god will rise up and destroy Aegon the Conqueror&rdquo;</b></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/52dc00c925e04f414c3efc0d5d1ec941/tumblr_inline_pqsyusGYXU1s6u549_540.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><p><b>Prophecy twist is when Aegon the Protector aka Jon Snow who has risen from the dead, destroys the Drowned God aka Euron Greyjoy.</b></p><p><b>Or the Drowned God aka Euron Greyjoy allies himself with Aegon the Conqueror come again aka Daenerys Stormborn to attempt to destroy KL???? </b>It remains to be seen.</p><p>Why will Jon need to kill Euron??? Maybe just maybe Euron will be involved in kidnapping Sansa to KL. And <a href=\"https://mebongster87.tumblr.com/post/182385181443/friendly-reminder-that-jon-snow-said-this-in\">Jon</a> has already said (to LF)&nbsp;<b>&ldquo;Touch my sister and I&rsquo;ll kill you myself&rdquo;.</b> That Chekhov&rsquo;s gun is still waiting to go off.</p><p>I can&rsquo;t help but think that the scene in the godswood in S08E01 Winterfell, in front of the heart tree, when Arya and Jon reunite and they talk about Sansa and Jon says that&nbsp;<b>&ldquo;I am her family too&rdquo;</b>, Arya says&nbsp;<b>&ldquo;don&rsquo;t forget that&rdquo; </b>is foreshadowing for Jon to remember his first vow after he was brought back from the death that he made to Sansa&hellip;<b>&rdquo;I won&rsquo;t ever let him touch you again, I will protect you, I promise&rdquo;</b>. Jon&rsquo;s vow to protect Sansa will come into play in a moment when Sansa&rsquo;s safety and her life is compromised. If Euron/GC come for her, then Jon&rsquo;s vows to protect Sansa are applicable here as well.&nbsp;</p><p>This Jon/Arya scene then transitions to a shot of KL, where we think Sansa will get kidnapped to, and then we have shots of Cersei and Qyburn, the Golden Company with Euron and, finally we have scenes where a &ldquo;sister&rdquo; is held captive by Euron. And who comes to rescue his &ldquo;sister&rdquo; Yara?? Theon, who is a foil to Jon&hellip;I think these are interesting scene transitions. Again, since it&rsquo;s rescuing one&rsquo;s sister, it could be that Arya is the one who comes to rescue Sansa, together with Jon, and ends up being the one to kill Euron.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/69bb86eacda091217f0a065efed11050/tumblr_inline_pqt0yrLbrA1s6u549_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Having said all of that, I am really not sure.

Yes, he was married, yes, he wanted sansa, we know that by his POVs.</li></ul><p>Shae gets jealous and tells Varys: &laquo;She is younger and she is beautiful&raquo;</p><ul><li>Lysa Arryn got the same line.</li></ul><p>&laquo;You want h e r!&raquo; + &laquo;What he did with your young, perfect body?!&raquo;</p><ul><li>Myranda got the same line.</li></ul><p>&laquo;Do you think she is pretty?&raquo;</p><p>Unwillingly, Sansa repeats itself all over and over again. Becomes an obstacle for other women&rsquo;s claims and wishes.</p><p>What she can take away from Cersei now? Sansa already took a lot: the way of thinking, her manners matches Cersei&rsquo;s ones, she&rsquo;s as sharp and witty as the queen is. But more than that: Sansa became much better in everything Cersei never have.</p><p>People are dying for Sansa by their devotion and love nor by the orders. Sansa takes care of her people and her kingdom. Even Jaime is one of the saviours of hers. For Cersei there&rsquo;s remained only to see what the little dove has become.</p><p>And to point this for jonsa-meta:</p><p>&laquo;You imagined he&rsquo;ll be with you forever, is that it?
