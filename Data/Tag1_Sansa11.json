She has bled for the North, she risked her life to get it back, she has been fearlessly defending it from an crazed invader with nukes, and she was ready to lay down her life for it\u2019s people.",

And how do you think the northern lords will trear her considered the fact she is married to a lannister? Will they support her or treat her coldly and call her lady lannister like stannis?.",

I don\u2019t think Sansa was \u201cdisinherited\u201d, I think Jon Snow was named as Robb\u2019s heir. Meaning she\u2019s still in line, she just now falls below Jon. And if she is disinherited, it would be made clear she was disinherited as Sansa Lannister; and if the show made anything clear, it\u2019s that Sansa and Tyrion\u2019s marriage will be dissolved, one way or another.<br/>Jon being placed above her as a bastard is not going to bother Sansa. She may be bothered that Robb gave Winterfell to someone else, but honestly, I don\u2019t think Sansa losing her claim would bother her; she hates having it, because it gives people leverage to use and abuse her.

One thing to make clear is that everyone in the story has prejudices, and even Jon himself is prejudiced against lowborns (hence him dreaming of his mother as highborn). The heroes of our story are learning to outgrow their preconceived notions though, and while Sansa doesn\u2019t have a modern view on class, she\u2019s not hung up on things like bastardy by TWOW. She thinks in AFFC that it would be so sweet to see him again:</p><blockquote><p>I am a bastard too now, just like him</p></blockquote><p>When she thinks of Harry\u2019s bastard daughter, she clarifies what offends her about that by telling him that his second child has a different mother than his first; Harry tries to talk of his children as if he\u2019s a good or noble man for having a daughter, but Sansa sees it as signs of his arrogance and general asshole-ry.<br/>And when Sansa is embarrassed by Harry in the yard, it isn\u2019t because she views being a bastard as a bad thing; it\u2019s because Harry uses it as an insult. If, in front of your peers, someone called you ugly \u2013 even if you weren\u2019t or didn\u2019t think being ugly was a bad thing \u2013 it would still embarrass you because whoever said it means it to be embarrassing. Harry is trying to say that Sansa is beneath him, that she doesn\u2019t deserve to show him anywhere because she\u2019s unimportant. Of course she reacts poorly to that, and has a gut reaction to knock him down a peg too since she has the knowledge that using his logic, she shouldn\u2019t be associating with him. It\u2019s one thing to be insulted in a way that\u2019s true, but quite another to have to hold your tongue while knowing your insulter is wrong. But when she responds to him, Sansa asserts her bastard status:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cAnd now if you will excuse me, Littlefinger\u2019s bastard must find her lord father and let him know that you have come, so we can begin the tourney on the morrow.\u201d</p></blockquote><p>And no, the Northern Lords absolutely won\u2019t have prejudice against her for being forcibly married to a Lannister. Stannis is called out for being the only to actually call her a Lannister, where everyone else knows she\u2019s a Stark. And the Northern Lords don\u2019t like Stannis at all, but they agree to march with him to save Ned Stark\u2019s daughter. Keep in mind, they think that Arya Stark has been married to Ramsay Bolton. But they don\u2019t care; it\u2019s obvious she would have been forced into the marriage, and they want to go save her. They won\u2019t treat Sansa any different. <br/></p>",

I don\u2019t think Sansa was \u201cdisinherited\u201d, I think Jon Snow was named as Robb\u2019s heir. Meaning she\u2019s still in line, she just now falls below Jon. And if she is disinherited, it would be made clear she was disinherited as Sansa Lannister; and if the show made anything clear, it\u2019s that Sansa and Tyrion\u2019s marriage will be dissolved, one way or another.<br>Jon being placed above her as a bastard is not going to bother Sansa. She may be bothered that Robb gave Winterfell to someone else, but honestly, I don\u2019t think Sansa losing her claim would bother her; she hates having it, because it gives people leverage to use and abuse her. As long as Sansa can be home in the North and/or Winterfell, she\u2019ll be happy.</p><p>Let me elaborate on why I don\u2019t think Jon being a bastard would bother her. One thing to make clear is that everyone in the story has prejudices, and even Jon himself is prejudiced against lowborns (hence him dreaming of his mother as highborn). The heroes of our story are learning to outgrow their preconceived notions though, and while Sansa doesn\u2019t have a modern view on class, she\u2019s not hung up on things like bastardy by TWOW. She thinks in AFFC that it would be so sweet to see him again:</p><blockquote><p>I am a bastard too now, just like him</p></blockquote><p>When she thinks of Harry\u2019s bastard daughter, she clarifies what offends her about that by telling him that his second child has a different mother than his first; Harry tries to talk of his children as if he\u2019s a good or noble man for having a daughter, but Sansa sees it as signs of his arrogance and general asshole-ry.<br>And when Sansa is embarrassed by Harry in the yard, it isn\u2019t because she views being a bastard as a bad thing; it\u2019s because Harry uses it as an insult. If, in front of your peers, someone called you ugly \u2013 even if you weren\u2019t or didn\u2019t think being ugly was a bad thing \u2013 it would still embarrass you because whoever said it means it to be embarrassing. Harry is trying to say that Sansa is beneath him, that she doesn\u2019t deserve to show him anywhere because she\u2019s unimportant. Of course she reacts poorly to that, and has a gut reaction to knock him down a peg too since she has the knowledge that using his logic, she shouldn\u2019t be associating with him. It\u2019s one thing to be insulted in a way that\u2019s true, but quite another to have to hold your tongue while knowing your insulter is wrong. But when she responds to him, Sansa asserts her bastard status:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cAnd now if you will excuse me, Littlefinger\u2019s bastard must find her lord father and let him know that you have come, so we can begin the tourney on the morrow.\u201d</p></blockquote><p>And no, the Northern Lords absolutely won\u2019t have prejudice against her for being forcibly married to a Lannister. Stannis is called out for being the only to actually call her a Lannister, where everyone else knows she\u2019s a Stark. And the Northern Lords don\u2019t like Stannis at all, but they agree to march with him to save Ned Stark\u2019s daughter. Keep in mind, they think that Arya Stark has been married to Ramsay Bolton. But they don\u2019t care; it\u2019s obvious she would have been forced into the marriage, and they want to go save her. They won\u2019t treat Sansa any different. <br></p></p>",
                "content": "<p><blockquote><p><i>The think that maybe believe she could have a problem with jon being the heir now is that in winds she still see to have a prejudice against bastard even when she is pretending to be one.
