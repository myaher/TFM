Lily manages to hit him in the stomach before he throws her to the ground. Your body screams at you to help her but you can&rsquo;t do that, she tries to get up but he hits her again, you knew Andrew, he&rsquo;s a decent guy, he is kind to you and doesn&rsquo;t treat you like you were fresh meat. After a few blows Lily falls unconscious and Andrew walks away, everyone smiles at his victory but he doesn&rsquo;t. <br/>&ldquo;where do you think you are going? you are not finished&rdquo; Captain Hanks says. <br/>&ldquo;she&rsquo;s unconscious&rdquo; Andrew says confused.<br/>&ldquo;This doesn&rsquo;t end until I say it, she may be faking it, a couple of broken ribs would confirm it&rdquo; he says almost smiling. <br/>Andrew approaches an unconscious Lily when you stand in front of her.<br/>&ldquo;the rules are to fight until one is unconscious&rdquo; you say. <br/>&ldquo;i make the rules Y/L/N, move away or you will be the one who receives the punishment&rdquo; He threatens you.<br/>&ldquo;the punishment for what?&rdquo; you yell this time &ldquo;When Robert lost you didn&rsquo;t had any problems, do you have a problem with women captain?&rdquo; <br/>&ldquo;Everybody out&rdquo; he says without looking away from you &ldquo;take her to her room&rdquo; he says pointing to lily. Andrew grabs Lily, you were sure he would take care of her. When everyone was gone, Hanks approaches you &ldquo;this is not a place for women, you are only burdens for us&rdquo; <br/>&ldquo;I have to remind you that I got the flag when none of your men got it? I capture the nonhuman, I have overcome all your damn tests&rdquo; You say tired of how she treats you. He grabs your arm hurting you, when you push him to let you go, you see something that surprises you, a tattoo, but not any tatoo&hellip;.the symbol of hydra, when he realizes that you have seen it he smiles at you, a smile that doesn&rsquo;t reach his eyes, and then he hits you in the head, leaving you unconscious.</p><p><br/></p><p>when you recover consciousness you are in a punishment cell, you had read about them.
