Canon? Never heard of that, not important, fics are here to fix it&hellip; It&rsquo;s kinda <b>angsty</b> but also <b>fluffy</b> at the end. This is my first fanfic so please let me know what you think if you read it c:</i></p><p>When Arya first set foot on Westerosi soil after a long time, it felt different. She expected to feel at home. </p><p><i>Stupid girl.</i> She thought, <i>You&rsquo;re still a long way from home. </i> The image of Winterfell appeared in her mind. The snow, the castle, the godswood and the weirwood tree. Gods know how it all looks like now. When thinking about the place that was once her home, Arya felt strange. It didn&rsquo;t quite feel like home anymore. Too much time spent so far from it and so many important memories that she made, none of them were connected to Winterfell. </p><p>She felt a stinging feeling in her heart. Betrayal? Heartbreak? Probably both. When she sailed to Braavos to find the man she trusted the most, all she got in return was pain and scars. Oh, so many scars. How could Jaqen H'ghar do this to her? All this time, she thought he&hellip; no, of course he didn&rsquo;t. </p><p><i>You&rsquo;re a fool for even thinking it.</i> She scolded herself in her mind and felt her heart sink a little again. She must move on. Jaqen H'ghar is dead, he said it himself. With this thought, the memory of him drinking poison, and then his dead body on the floor of the Hall of Faces played on repeat in her head. Arya couldn&rsquo;t help it, her eyes started watering. At the point when her eyes were covered in a layer of salty tears and her vision blurred by them, she looked down and closed her eyes. The tears dropped on the green Westerosi grass. </p><p>She didn&rsquo;t even know how she got this far. Lost in her thoughts, she walked inlands, the port barely visible from behind a small hill she passed. The sun already started to set, coming closer to the horizon and painting the sky a peachy hue. She shook her head to clear her thoughts and walked towards a town she saw in the distance. She had enough silver to get herself a room for the night at an inn. </p><p>_______________________</p><p>After a bit of bargaining, the innkeeper growled and gave her a key to one of the small rooms in the attic. </p><p>It wasn&rsquo;t much, but the bed was softer and larger compared to what she slept on in Braavos. It even had fox fur covers. She closed the door behind her and sat on the edge of the bed, looking out of the small window, watching the sky change colours as the sun went down. Suddenly she had a strange feeling in her gut. She grabbed Needle and quickly stood up and turned around to see a familiar figure towering over the bedframe. Of course she couldn&rsquo;t hear him coming, he was quiet as always with that half smirk on his face that never goes away.</p><p>&ldquo;A girl looks sad.&rdquo; Jaqen smiled gently at her. He was no longer wearing the cloak like in the House of Black and White. He was dressed in dark armour, with a longsword resting by his side. It was nowhere as noble as the Lannister armour he wore in Harrenhal. It was more like what her brother Jon wore, when she last saw him. </p><p>&ldquo;Did you come to kill me?&rdquo; Arya hissed at him. She tried not to show any emotions.</p><p>&ldquo;A man would never do such a thing. However I&rsquo;ve heard the faceless men weren&rsquo;t so gentle with a lovely girl.&rdquo; He spoke so calmly, his eyes looked like they were smiling. Arya even saw relief and sadness in them, she didn&rsquo;t know what to think about it.</p><p>&ldquo;It was you! You beat me, blinded me, did your stupid suicide trick to make me think you&rsquo;re dead. I&rsquo;m not falling for any of your tricks anymore!&rdquo; She gradually raised her voice and failed to keep a stone cold face. She caught herself pointing Needle at Jaqen&rsquo;s chest as she looked up into his eyes.</p><p>Jaqen couldn&rsquo;t bear when to see her like this. A lovely girl, who trusted him, and he wasn&rsquo;t there when she needed him the most. It broke his heart to see her all broken, thinking he&rsquo;s betrayed her. There was a connection between them, a strong bond. Even when she was pointing a sword at him, knowing full well she&rsquo;s capable of impaling his heart at this very moment, he still hoped there&rsquo;s some of it left. </p><p>&ldquo;Arya.&rdquo; He looked her in the eyes.

His lovely girl, she despised him. And that was breaking his heart. </p><p>&ldquo;A man must ask for forgiveness. He failed a girl. Now she&rsquo;s grown stronger, she can take care of herself. Please, forgive a man and he&rsquo;ll be on his way. A girl will never have to look at a man again, I promise.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A girl forgives.&rdquo; Arya said quietly. She didn&rsquo;t blindly trust him like before. Her trust in him was broken, but that was the trust in another man wearing his face. This man standing in front of her was her Jaqen, she knew that. How could she be so stupid to trust those faceless men. Of course she felt like something was off back then, especially with &ldquo;Jaqen&rdquo;. But she just accepted the thought that he didn&rsquo;t care about her. She couldn&rsquo;t be more wrong. </p><p>Jaqen nodded. &ldquo;Very well.&rdquo; He leaned closer to her, so close she could smell his scent of ginger and cloves.

She expected to feel at home. </p><p><i>Stupid girl.</i> She thought, <i>You\u2019re still a long way from home. </i> The image of Winterfell appeared in her mind. The snow, the castle, the godswood and the weirwood tree. Gods know how it all looks like now. When thinking about the place that was once her home, Arya felt strange. It didn\u2019t quite feel like home anymore. Too much time spent so far from it and so many important memories that she made, none of them were connected to Winterfell. </p><p>She felt a stinging feeling in her heart. Betrayal? Heartbreak? Probably both. When she sailed to Braavos to find the man she trusted the most, all she got in return was pain and scars. Oh, so many scars. How could Jaqen H'ghar do this to her? All this time, she thought he\u2026 no, of course he didn\u2019t. </p><p><i>You\u2019re a fool for even thinking it.</i> She scolded herself in her mind and felt her heart sink a little again. She must move on. Jaqen H'ghar is dead, he said it himself. With this thought, the memory of him drinking poison, and then his dead body on the floor of the Hall of Faces played on repeat in her head. Arya couldn\u2019t help it, her eyes started watering. At the point when her eyes were covered in a layer of salty tears and her vision blurred by them, she looked down and closed her eyes. The tears dropped on the green Westerosi grass. </p><p>She didn\u2019t even know how she got this far. Lost in her thoughts, she walked inlands, the port barely visible from behind a small hill she passed. The sun already started to set, coming closer to the horizon and painting the sky a peachy hue. She shook her head to clear her thoughts and walked towards a town she saw in the distance. She had enough silver to get herself a room for the night at an inn. </p><p>_______________________</p><p>After a bit of bargaining, the innkeeper growled and gave her a key to one of the small rooms in the attic. </p><p>It wasn\u2019t much, but the bed was softer and larger compared to what she slept on in Braavos. It even had fox fur covers. She closed the door behind her and sat on the edge of the bed, looking out of the small window, watching the sky change colours as the sun went down.

Of course she couldn\u2019t hear him coming, he was quiet as always with that half smirk on his face that never goes away.</p><p>\u201cA girl looks sad.\u201d Jaqen smiled gently at her.

But she just accepted the thought that he didn\u2019t care about her. She couldn\u2019t be more wrong. </p><p>Jaqen nodded. \u201cVery well.\u201d He leaned closer to her, so close she could smell his scent of ginger and cloves.

As he took a step out of the room into the hallway, he felt a hand grabbing his arm and pulling it back.</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t go Jaqen.\u201d Arya made him turn around and looked at him like she did when they left Harrenhal. </p><p>Jaqen didn\u2019t need any more convincing. He stepped back into the room and closed the door. There was no point resisting it now, he wrapped his arms around her and held her tightly. Arya did the same and pressed her whole body against him. Jaqen wanted to say something when she pushed away, but didn\u2019t get the chance. She stood up on her tiptoes and pressed her lips against his. He put his arms around her waist and pulled her closer. </p><p>\u201cA girl should sleep.\u201d Jaqen smirked as he looked down at Arya\u2019s smiling face.</p><p>\u201cWill you stay with me?\u201d </p><p>\u201cA man will do whatever a lovely girl wishes.\u201d He laid down on the bed. \u201cCome here.

                "content": "<p><h1>Arya Stark x Jaqen H'ghar One Shot</h1><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"0\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"1\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><p><b>Summary:</b> <i>When Arya leaves Braavos to go home, she meets an old friend who isn&rsquo;t who she thought he was. </i></p><p><b>Notes:</b> <i>This is kind of an AU I guess? Canon? Never heard of that, not important, fics are here to fix it&hellip; It&rsquo;s kinda <b>angsty</b> but also <b>fluffy</b> at the end. This is my first fanfic so please let me know what you think if you read it c:</i></p><p>When Arya first set foot on Westerosi soil after a long time, it felt different. She expected to feel at home. </p><p><i>Stupid girl.</i> She thought, <i>You&rsquo;re still a long way from home. </i> The image of Winterfell appeared in her mind. The snow, the castle, the godswood and the weirwood tree. Gods know how it all looks like now. When thinking about the place that was once her home, Arya felt strange. It didn&rsquo;t quite feel like home anymore. Too much time spent so far from it and so many important memories that she made, none of them were connected to Winterfell. </p><p>She felt a stinging feeling in her heart. Betrayal? Heartbreak? Probably both. When she sailed to Braavos to find the man she trusted the most, all she got in return was pain and scars. Oh, so many scars. How could Jaqen H'ghar do this to her? All this time, she thought he&hellip; no, of course he didn&rsquo;t. </p><p><i>You&rsquo;re a fool for even thinking it.</i> She scolded herself in her mind and felt her heart sink a little again. She must move on. Jaqen H'ghar is dead, he said it himself. With this thought, the memory of him drinking poison, and then his dead body on the floor of the Hall of Faces played on repeat in her head. Arya couldn&rsquo;t help it, her eyes started watering. At the point when her eyes were covered in a layer of salty tears and her vision blurred by them, she looked down and closed her eyes. The tears dropped on the green Westerosi grass. </p><p>She didn&rsquo;t even know how she got this far. Lost in her thoughts, she walked inlands, the port barely visible from behind a small hill she passed. The sun already started to set, coming closer to the horizon and painting the sky a peachy hue. She shook her head to clear her thoughts and walked towards a town she saw in the distance. She had enough silver to get herself a room for the night at an inn. </p><p>_______________________</p><p>After a bit of bargaining, the innkeeper growled and gave her a key to one of the small rooms in the attic. </p><p>It wasn&rsquo;t much, but the bed was softer and larger compared to what she slept on in Braavos. It even had fox fur covers. She closed the door behind her and sat on the edge of the bed, looking out of the small window, watching the sky change colours as the sun went down. Suddenly she had a strange feeling in her gut. She grabbed Needle and quickly stood up and turned around to see a familiar figure towering over the bedframe. Of course she couldn&rsquo;t hear him coming, he was quiet as always with that half smirk on his face that never goes away.</p><p>&ldquo;A girl looks sad.&rdquo; Jaqen smiled gently at her. He was no longer wearing the cloak like in the House of Black and White. He was dressed in dark armour, with a longsword resting by his side. It was nowhere as noble as the Lannister armour he wore in Harrenhal. It was more like what her brother Jon wore, when she last saw him. </p><p>&ldquo;Did you come to kill me?&rdquo; Arya hissed at him. She tried not to show any emotions.</p><p>&ldquo;A man would never do such a thing. However I&rsquo;ve heard the faceless men weren&rsquo;t so gentle with a lovely girl.&rdquo; He spoke so calmly, his eyes looked like they were smiling. Arya even saw relief and sadness in them, she didn&rsquo;t know what to think about it.</p><p>&ldquo;It was you! You beat me, blinded me, did your stupid suicide trick to make me think you&rsquo;re dead. I&rsquo;m not falling for any of your tricks anymore!&rdquo; She gradually raised her voice and failed to keep a stone cold face. She caught herself pointing Needle at Jaqen&rsquo;s chest as she looked up into his eyes.</p><p>Jaqen couldn&rsquo;t bear when to see her like this. A lovely girl, who trusted him, and he wasn&rsquo;t there when she needed him the most. It broke his heart to see her all broken, thinking he&rsquo;s betrayed her. There was a connection between them, a strong bond. Even when she was pointing a sword at him, knowing full well she&rsquo;s capable of impaling his heart at this very moment, he still hoped there&rsquo;s some of it left. </p><p>&ldquo;Arya.&rdquo; He looked her in the eyes. It was a gift to him that she&rsquo;s still alive and he could see her eyes quickly travelling to look at his hands, then lips, he even caught her stealing a glimpse at the silver streak in his hair.</p><p>&ldquo;A man only came to Braavos when a girl was already gone. This face can be worn by others. And you gave them the name on a plate.&rdquo; He stood there still, like a statue.</p><p>Arya didn&rsquo;t say a word.</p><p>&ldquo;You told them you were looking for Jaqen H'ghar. Of course they knew how to make a girl trust them.&rdquo; He gave out a small sigh and looked down. </p><p>&ldquo;A man is sorry. He should never have left a girl. Will a lovely girl forgive a man?&rdquo; He looked her in the eyes again.</p><p><i>Lovely girl.</i> Those words echoed through Arya&rsquo;s head like beautiful music. Her heart beat two times faster, she never realized how much she needs to hear those words. Until now. She craved them.</p><p>&ldquo;Lovely girl, please.&rdquo; Jaqen said, as if he was reading her mind, &ldquo;A girl may have owed a debt to the Red God. It has been paid. But a man also owes a girl. For saving his life.&rdquo; </p><p>As she looked into his eyes, she slowly lowered Needle. She saw nothing but coldness in the eyes of the man she believed to be Jaqen in Braavos. These eyes were different. The way he looked at her, soft, warm, like he&rsquo;s trying to envelop her with protective beams of light. She dropped Needle on the floor and let in a deep breath.</p><p>Jaqen smiled and took a step towards her. Ever since they parted there wasn&rsquo;t a day he didn&rsquo;t think about her. Where is Arya Stark now? Is she okay? <i>When will we meet again?</i> He wanted to wrap his arms around her small body, kiss her on her chestnut hair and never let go. Even though he wasn&rsquo;t the one who beat and hurt her, the guilt was still unbearable. What does she see, what does she think and feel when she looks at his face now? His lovely girl, she despised him. And that was breaking his heart. </p><p>&ldquo;A man must ask for forgiveness. He failed a girl. Now she&rsquo;s grown stronger, she can take care of herself. Please, forgive a man and he&rsquo;ll be on his way. A girl will never have to look at a man again, I promise.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A girl forgives.&rdquo; Arya said quietly. She didn&rsquo;t blindly trust him like before. Her trust in him was broken, but that was the trust in another man wearing his face. This man standing in front of her was her Jaqen, she knew that. How could she be so stupid to trust those faceless men. Of course she felt like something was off back then, especially with &ldquo;Jaqen&rdquo;. But she just accepted the thought that he didn&rsquo;t care about her. She couldn&rsquo;t be more wrong. </p><p>Jaqen nodded. &ldquo;Very well.&rdquo; He leaned closer to her, so close she could smell his scent of ginger and cloves. He stared deeply into her eyes and got lost in them for a moment. Just one more second and he would&hellip;</p><p>&ldquo;A man should say goodbye now.&rdquo; He abruptly looked away and straightened his posture again. </p><p>Arya let out a soft gasp and desperately looked at him with her big eyes.</p><p>Jaqen turned around and opened the door, ready to leave. </p><p>&ldquo;Take care, lovely girl.&rdquo; He smiled to hide the pain.

            "description": "Hi there! My name is Ellie! Welcome to my tumblr! \u00a0Just thought I'd add a few things to know about me and my blog! If my url gives you any clues, at the heart of this tumblr, I'm a proud Harmony shipper through and through. And while I do still reblog HHR and Dan and Emma content (and I always will) you will find that the majority of my focus has shifted to Jonerys (Jon x Daenerys from Game of Thrones).\u00a0And while you might have to do a little deep blogging to find my reblogs on these, I also ship--both passionately and casually--Cesare x Lucrezia, Mulder x Scully, Lizzington for a while until tptb started to mess with it, Baker x Lawson (Bawson), all the Sense8 ships though Kalagang is my #1, Clint x Natasha (Clintasha), Jane x Thor (Fosterson), Darcy x Loki (Tasertricks), Darcy x Steve (Shieldshock), Kili x Tauriel (Kiliel), Superman x Wonder Woman (Superwonder), and more than I have space for or the memory to list. \nI do my best to tag every post so that if something is your notp, it's nsfw, or it's triggering, you can blacklist it. That said, if you follow me and there is something that you need tagged in order to make it a happy place for you to explore, come into my inbox and let me know :) You will also see a lot of politically charged reblogs in support of women, the queer/gender-queer and trans community, BLM, Muslims, POC, Jewish people, the mentally ill, and austistic people. I'm strongly pro choice, pro inter-sectional feminism, and refuse to call the angry cheeto currently living in the white house president. If anything like that offends you, this might not be the right blog for you.\nLast little few things to throw out there: I'm 35, I plan to adopt at least 4 cats (or more) at some point and be that cat lady everyone's always whispering about, and I tend to greet and converse with everyone I meet like an overeager puppy. \nWhew! Sorry for the long intro folks! Please enjoy your time here, and remember, you're always welcome to come in and say hi!",

Finally, he looked up and noticed his friend\u2019s unreadable expression.\u00a0\u201cDon\u2019t tell me you haven\u2019t noticed? The dude is addicted to his phone!\u201d<br/></p><!-- more --><p>\u201cGendry?\u201d questioned Arya. Gendry wasn\u2019t addicted to his phone. Arya spent months \u00a0trying to convince him to trade in his Nokia for a smartphone, and even then it was only after his new job required him to. She spent three hours last week teaching him how to download Snapchat before the guy completely gave up and nearly destroyed it.\u00a0<br/></p><p>Hot Pie laughed.\u00a0\u201cArry, you seriously haven\u2019t noticed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know he\u2019s texting a girl though?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cHe always gets smiley and shit, plus yesterday I asked him about it and his face got sooo red!\u201d Hot Pie went back to shuffle through a few discs.\u00a0\u201cDo you think she could set me up with one of her friends when he finally introduces us?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cIntroduces who?\u201d Gendry walked into his and Hot Pie\u2019s shared apartment with an extra-large pizza in his arms.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYour girlf-\u201d Arya kicked Hot Pie with the side of her foot to shut him up. She didn\u2019t know why she did it, but part of her really didn\u2019t want to know about Gendry\u2019s new fling.\u00a0<br/></p><p>It\u00a0wasn&rsquo;t shocking- she had always known Gendry was attractive. He had no game whatsoever, but his awkward charm only seemed to make girls flaunt to him more, not that he ever really noticed. The past few bar trips the three friends made, Gendry was especially oblivious to a lot of very pretty girl\u2019s more blatant attempts at flirting - one girl even going as far as to throwing her drink on his shirt for ignoring her. Luckily, Arya\u2019s apartment was close by and he always had a stash of extra clothes there just in case.\u00a0</p><p>Gendry having what could be a more serious relationship in the works would explain his behavior, and admitting that made Arya feel very hollow.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSo what are we watching?\u201d Changing the topic, Arya plopped herself onto the couch and motioned for Gendry to give her a slice of pizza.\u00a0</p><p>***</p><p>The next few days, Arya tried to catalog when Gendry was on his phone, which wasn\u2019t very often. Once, when he left to go to the bathroom during one of their Sunday coffee trips , she stole her friend\u2019s phone. She picked it up, but when she had gotten to the lockscreen, she had hesitated - it wouldn\u2019t be hard to guess the password (\u201dBULL\u201d), but she still her brain stopped her from opening the phone.\u00a0</p><p>If she opened it, she would be invading Gendry\u2019s privacy. Which should have bothered her more, but honestly she was never one for\u00a0\u201crespecting boundaries\u201d when it came to Gendry, nor was he one to ever be bothered by her nosey-personality. No, what stopped her was the same thing that stopped her the few days before when she kicked Hot Pie.\u00a0If she opened it, and it were true, what then?\u00a0</p><p>She must have waited to long because before Arya realized it, Gendry was back \u00a0from the bathroom.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing with my phone?\u201d he asked her defensively, but still made no motion to take it from her.\u00a0<br/></p><p>Snapping herself back to reality, Arya quickly recovered.\u00a0\u201cWhy do you have the most generic fucking background?\u201d Which was true- it seemed phone-addict Gendry had never figured out how to change the background.</p><p>His blush only proved her suspicions.\u00a0\u201cW-well, I, uh..Shutup!\u201d</p><p>She only laughed and pulled him into the booth next to her- ignoring the lack of space between them. Opening the camera, she held the phone up to get both of them in the shot.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d he asked her.<br/></p><p>\u201cChaning your background, shh.\u201d She stuck her tongue out and held up an easy peace sign. \u00a0Looking at the phone screen, Gendry only laughed at his friend and pulled her closer, his arm wrapping around her shoulders.\u00a0</p><p>After she showed him how to open his setting and change his background, his arm still loosely laying across her shoulder, Gendry took the phone and tossed it onto his bag that was still lounging in the booth across the table.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNow that that\u2019s done, no more phone,\u201d said Gendry as he looked down at his friend.\u00a0\u201cYou were telling me about fencing practice?\u201d<br/></p><p>She smiled as she began retelling the story of how she played Joffery out flat in their practice, enjoying the moment and pushing the idea of girlfriends and texts far from her mind.</p><p>***</p><p>Arya wanted her sister to feel good, but Arya did not understand why they were torturing her to do it.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cArya, sit up nicely,\u201d scolded her mother as Arya slouched in the fancily uncomfortable chairs the up-scale dress shoppe had to offer. In celebration of Sansa\u2019s graduation from Law school, Cat Stark offered to buy both her daughters new dresses to wear at the dinner party they were to have after the ceremony. At first it was sweet, but it had been three hours and Arya was ready to go.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cHow about this one?\u201d asked Sansa as she came out in a light pink dress that fell just past her knees. She looked beautiful in it. Just like the other fifteen dresses the girl had tried on.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cOh Sans!\u201d their mother cooed again.\u00a0<br/></p><p>Arya watched as the two gossiped and obsessed over the dress, scrolling through her Instagram as she did. She snorted at a post that had scrolled through - someone Indian advertisement for Google - and sent it to Gendry. He responded with a\u00a0\u201chahaha\u201d, which made Arya roll her eyes at how mentally old her friend was sometimes. The she started wondering what he texted his girlfriend - Died he respond the same or did they have long deep conversations?\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWho are you texting?\u201d Her mother asked her as Sansa went back to change into the next dress.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cGendry,\u201d Arya answered. Her mother made a face, hinting at something. Arya rolled her eyes.\u00a0\u201cMom, we\u2019re just friends!\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cI know, I know,\u201d Cat calmed her daughter, obviously not believing her.\u00a0\u201cHey, why don\u2019t you invite him to Sansa\u2019s graduation dinner?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cArya, he\u2019s more than just <i>your</i>\u00a0friend. Everyone adores him, and he should know that he is welcome to come!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he comes, though, tell him to leave his phone at home!\u201d yelled Sansa from behind the curtain separating her from the dressing room lobby.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Arya felt a similar sinking feeling in her chest.<br/></p><p>\u201cHim, Jon, and I went out the other night and he spent the whole time glued to his phone!\u201d Sansa laughed as she came out in a navy blue dress that fit her figure very nicely.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cWell the was rude of him,\u201d Mrs. Stark spoke up.<br/></p><p>\u201cOh no, Mother, it was actually very sweet,\u201d Sansa gushed.\u00a0\u201cHe would be in the middle of a sentence and would just stop to giggle at his phone!\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cGendry doesn\u2019t giggle,\u201d said Arya.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cWell the closest thing to what Gendry giggling would be,\u201d countered Sansa.\u00a0\u201cWho is he texting?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cHow should I know?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cI mean you are only his best friend.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cWell I guess we\u2019re not as close as you thought then.\u201d Arya grumbled.<br/></p><p>Sansa and her mother exchanged looks before turning back to the annoyed Arya.</p><p>\u201cNonetheless, Rickon misses the boy dearly,\u201d said Mrs. Stark.\u00a0\u201cPlease ask him to come.\u201d<br/></p><p>***</p><p>After Sansa finally agreed on a dress that\u00a0\u201cFelt like her\u201d- whatever that meant - the three went to lunch at a pub nearby. Arya had been practically shaking with excitement at the idea that she would have a burger and fries in hand within the hour. Despite the fact Arya was twenty-two, Mrs Stark sent Arya to wash her hands before they ate.</p><p>\u201cWhat, why doesn\u2019t Sansa have to?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cBecause Sansa didn\u2019t play with the stray cat outside,\u201d her mother responded, unresolving.\u00a0\u201cGo wash your hands.\u201d<br/></p><p>Grumbling the entire way, Arya made her way to the bathroom. To get there, she had to pass the bar-area of the pub where a large party of people were congregated. Recognizing the grubby and darkened hands, as well as the uniform Stag logo across their mustard-colored shirts, Arya realized that they were all construction workers for Gendry\u2019s father\u2019s company. Which meant&hellip;</p><p>Eyeing the crowd, her eyes settled on him. Gendry had insisted his father let him work amongst the blue-colored gentlemen and ladies he had admired for so long before he inherited the entire business. And there he was, nestled around the large burly men and women, all laughing after a long-morning of hard work. His hair was damp from sweat, and he was drinking a beer he had probably been nursing longer than any of his coworkers.\u00a0</p><p>In the briefest of moments, one that only someone truly staring at him as Arya was would notice, Gendry subtly reached into his back pocket and pulled out his phone. His eyebrows knitted together as he sent it onto the table and continued listening to his friends, but with significantly less attention than he had before.\u00a0</p><p>Arya then pulled her phone and sent a quick text - a picture of the cat she had been playing with earlier.\u00a0</p><p>Instantly, Gendry\u2019s phone screen light up and the man raced to grab it. Arya watched as her friend\u2019s face softened and he chuckled to himself. He began to type a bit of text, and then Arya saw the\u00a0\u201ccute\u201d of his response pop-up on her phone.\u00a0</p><p>The bearded ginger man next to Gendry looked at his phone and began poking his side with his elbow. A group of workers around them joined in at the chirping - saying things like\u00a0\u201cWho\u2019s the lucky sucker, Gen?\u201d\u00a0\u201cHey Bossman, who\u2019s got you smiling like that?\u201d\u00a0\u201cLook at Cupid!\u201d</p><p>Gendry eventually had to leave the crowd hassling him, but had been smiling as he did so. Arya followed him to the hallway leading to the bathroom, his eyes glued to his phone the entire time.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cGendry,\u201d Area said to her friend\u2019s back.<br/></p><p>Jumping, Gendry turned around.\u00a0\u201cJesus, Arry,\u201d he grabbed at his chest.\u00a0\u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho are you texting?\u201d Arya wasted no time in asking, her entire self being coasting on adrenaline at this point.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cWha- no one!\u201d Gendry\u2019s breathing and deep-set blush gave him away, so Arya pushed farther.<br/></p><p>\u201cHot Pie and Sansa have both told me that the past few weeks you\u2019ve been addicted to your phone,\u201d Arya explained.\u00a0\u201cThey think you have some secret girlfriend.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cGirlfriend?\u201d Gendry, if possible, became even more red.<br/></p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t believe them at first, but you certainly very attached to your phone right now.\u201d Arya stepped closer and took said phone out of Gendry\u2019s limp hand. She looked at the picture the two had taken weeks ago. Studying it now, it was very apparent how comfortable Gendry looked- more comfortable than he did with any of the other girls he had talked to at the bar, and more like how he looked when he had received her texted earlier.\u00a0\u201cIs it me?\u201d<br/></p><p>Gendry stayed silent, eyes glued to the phone screen Arya had been studying.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cBecause I like you.\u201d She said it casually, but her heart was racing faster than it ever had before.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cYou what?\u201d Gendry looked dup to meet her eyes.<br/></p><p>She only quirked her eyebrow as he studied her face. His eyes followed the movement, slowly circling her features until they landed on her lips.</p><p>\u201cArya-\u201d he had said, breathlessly.\u00a0</p><p>The word was all the encouragement Arya needed. The love drenched in every syllable of her name was too much for her to handle. She surged up meet his mouth with hers and kissed him deeply. His hands cradled her back, immediately responding to her.\u00a0</p><p>The broke off as quickly as they had begun, both very aware that they were still in a very public area.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cMy mother wants you to come to Sansa\u2019s graduation dinner,\u201d she told him in between breaths.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cDo <i>you</i>\u00a0want me to come?\u201d He asked sincerely, but part of him already knowing the answer.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs your friend or&hellip;\u201d His eyes looked hopefully as he asked it. Arya laughed at herself for ever thinking there was ever anyone else. This was Gendry, the boy that would listen to her rants for days on end, who would do anything for her. What other girl could compete?<br/><br/>\u201cBoyfriend.\u201d She said, trying and failing to hold back a smile.\u00a0<br/></p>",

His eyebrows knitted together as he sent it onto the table and continued listening to his friends, but with significantly less attention than he had before.\u00a0</p><p>Arya then pulled her phone and sent a quick text - a picture of the cat she had been playing with earlier.\u00a0</p><p>Instantly, Gendry\u2019s phone screen light up and the man raced to grab it.

Finally, he looked up and noticed his friend\u2019s unreadable expression.\u00a0\u201cDon\u2019t tell me you haven\u2019t noticed? The dude is addicted to his phone!\u201d<br></p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cGendry?\u201d questioned Arya. Gendry wasn\u2019t addicted to his phone. Arya spent months \u00a0trying to convince him to trade in his Nokia for a smartphone, and even then it was only after his new job required him to. She spent three hours last week teaching him how to download Snapchat before the guy completely gave up and nearly destroyed it.\u00a0<br></p><p>Hot Pie laughed.\u00a0\u201cArry, you seriously haven\u2019t noticed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know he\u2019s texting a girl though?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cHe always gets smiley and shit, plus yesterday I asked him about it and his face got sooo red!\u201d Hot Pie went back to shuffle through a few discs.\u00a0\u201cDo you think she could set me up with one of her friends when he finally introduces us?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cIntroduces who?\u201d Gendry walked into his and Hot Pie\u2019s shared apartment with an extra-large pizza in his arms.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYour girlf-\u201d Arya kicked Hot Pie with the side of her foot to shut him up. She didn\u2019t know why she did it, but part of her really didn\u2019t want to know about Gendry\u2019s new fling.\u00a0<br></p><p>It\u00a0wasn\u2019t shocking- she had always known Gendry was attractive. He had no game whatsoever, but his awkward charm only seemed to make girls flaunt to him more, not that he ever really noticed. The past few bar trips the three friends made, Gendry was especially oblivious to a lot of very pretty girl\u2019s more blatant attempts at flirting - one girl even going as far as to throwing her drink on his shirt for ignoring her. Luckily, Arya\u2019s apartment was close by and he always had a stash of extra clothes there just in case.\u00a0</p><p>Gendry having what could be a more serious relationship in the works would explain his behavior, and admitting that made Arya feel very hollow.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSo what are we watching?\u201d Changing the topic, Arya plopped herself onto the couch and motioned for Gendry to give her a slice of pizza.\u00a0</p><p>***</p><p>The next few days, Arya tried to catalog when Gendry was on his phone, which wasn\u2019t very often. Once, when he left to go to the bathroom during one of their Sunday coffee trips , she stole her friend\u2019s phone. She picked it up, but when she had gotten to the lockscreen, she had hesitated - it wouldn\u2019t be hard to guess the password (\u201dBULL\u201d), but she still her brain stopped her from opening the phone.\u00a0</p><p>If she opened it, she would be invading Gendry\u2019s privacy. Which should have bothered her more, but honestly she was never one for\u00a0\u201crespecting boundaries\u201d when it came to Gendry, nor was he one to ever be bothered by her nosey-personality. No, what stopped her was the same thing that stopped her the few days before when she kicked Hot Pie.\u00a0If she opened it, and it were true, what then?\u00a0</p><p>She must have waited to long because before Arya realized it, Gendry was back \u00a0from the bathroom.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing with my phone?\u201d he asked her defensively, but still made no motion to take it from her.\u00a0<br></p><p>Snapping herself back to reality, Arya quickly recovered.\u00a0\u201cWhy do you have the most generic fucking background?\u201d Which was true- it seemed phone-addict Gendry had never figured out how to change the background.</p><p>His blush only proved her suspicions.\u00a0\u201cW-well, I, uh..Shutup!\u201d</p><p>She only laughed and pulled him into the booth next to her- ignoring the lack of space between them. Opening the camera, she held the phone up to get both of them in the shot.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d he asked her.<br></p><p>\u201cChaning your background, shh.\u201d She stuck her tongue out and held up an easy peace sign. \u00a0Looking at the phone screen, Gendry only laughed at his friend and pulled her closer, his arm wrapping around her shoulders.\u00a0</p><p>After she showed him how to open his setting and change his background, his arm still loosely laying across her shoulder, Gendry took the phone and tossed it onto his bag that was still lounging in the booth across the table.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNow that that\u2019s done, no more phone,\u201d said Gendry as he looked down at his friend.\u00a0\u201cYou were telling me about fencing practice?\u201d<br></p><p>She smiled as she began retelling the story of how she played Joffery out flat in their practice, enjoying the moment and pushing the idea of girlfriends and texts far from her mind.</p><p>***</p><p>Arya wanted her sister to feel good, but Arya did not understand why they were torturing her to do it.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cArya, sit up nicely,\u201d scolded her mother as Arya slouched in the fancily uncomfortable chairs the up-scale dress shoppe had to offer. In celebration of Sansa\u2019s graduation from Law school, Cat Stark offered to buy both her daughters new dresses to wear at the dinner party they were to have after the ceremony. At first it was sweet, but it had been three hours and Arya was ready to go.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cHow about this one?\u201d asked Sansa as she came out in a light pink dress that fell just past her knees. She looked beautiful in it. Just like the other fifteen dresses the girl had tried on.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cOh Sans!\u201d their mother cooed again.\u00a0<br></p><p>Arya watched as the two gossiped and obsessed over the dress, scrolling through her Instagram as she did. She snorted at a post that had scrolled through - someone Indian advertisement for Google - and sent it to Gendry. He responded with a\u00a0\u201chahaha\u201d, which made Arya roll her eyes at how mentally old her friend was sometimes. The she started wondering what he texted his girlfriend - Died he respond the same or did they have long deep conversations?\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWho are you texting?\u201d Her mother asked her as Sansa went back to change into the next dress.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cGendry,\u201d Arya answered. Her mother made a face, hinting at something. Arya rolled her eyes.\u00a0\u201cMom, we\u2019re just friends!\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI know, I know,\u201d Cat calmed her daughter, obviously not believing her.\u00a0\u201cHey, why don\u2019t you invite him to Sansa\u2019s graduation dinner?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cArya, he\u2019s more than just <i>your</i>\u00a0friend. Everyone adores him, and he should know that he is welcome to come!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he comes, though, tell him to leave his phone at home!\u201d yelled Sansa from behind the curtain separating her from the dressing room lobby.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Arya felt a similar sinking feeling in her chest.<br></p><p>\u201cHim, Jon, and I went out the other night and he spent the whole time glued to his phone!\u201d Sansa laughed as she came out in a navy blue dress that fit her figure very nicely.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWell the was rude of him,\u201d Mrs. Stark spoke up.<br></p><p>\u201cOh no, Mother, it was actually very sweet,\u201d Sansa gushed.\u00a0\u201cHe would be in the middle of a sentence and would just stop to giggle at his phone!\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cGendry doesn\u2019t giggle,\u201d said Arya.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWell the closest thing to what Gendry giggling would be,\u201d countered Sansa.\u00a0\u201cWho is he texting?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cHow should I know?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI mean you are only his best friend.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWell I guess we\u2019re not as close as you thought then.\u201d Arya grumbled.<br></p><p>Sansa and her mother exchanged looks before turning back to the annoyed Arya.</p><p>\u201cNonetheless, Rickon misses the boy dearly,\u201d said Mrs. Stark.\u00a0\u201cPlease ask him to come.\u201d<br></p><p>***</p><p>After Sansa finally agreed on a dress that\u00a0\u201cFelt like her\u201d- whatever that meant - the three went to lunch at a pub nearby. Arya had been practically shaking with excitement at the idea that she would have a burger and fries in hand within the hour. Despite the fact Arya was twenty-two, Mrs Stark sent Arya to wash her hands before they ate.</p><p>\u201cWhat, why doesn\u2019t Sansa have to?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cBecause Sansa didn\u2019t play with the stray cat outside,\u201d her mother responded, unresolving.\u00a0\u201cGo wash your hands.\u201d<br></p><p>Grumbling the entire way, Arya made her way to the bathroom. To get there, she had to pass the bar-area of the pub where a large party of people were congregated. Recognizing the grubby and darkened hands, as well as the uniform Stag logo across their mustard-colored shirts, Arya realized that they were all construction workers for Gendry\u2019s father\u2019s company. Which meant\u2026</p><p>Eyeing the crowd, her eyes settled on him. Gendry had insisted his father let him work amongst the blue-colored gentlemen and ladies he had admired for so long before he inherited the entire business. And there he was, nestled around the large burly men and women, all laughing after a long-morning of hard work. His hair was damp from sweat, and he was drinking a beer he had probably been nursing longer than any of his coworkers.\u00a0</p><p>In the briefest of moments, one that only someone truly staring at him as Arya was would notice, Gendry subtly reached into his back pocket and pulled out his phone. His eyebrows knitted together as he sent it onto the table and continued listening to his friends, but with significantly less attention than he had before.\u00a0</p><p>Arya then pulled her phone and sent a quick text - a picture of the cat she had been playing with earlier.\u00a0</p><p>Instantly, Gendry\u2019s phone screen light up and the man raced to grab it.

A group of workers around them joined in at the chirping - saying things like\u00a0\u201cWho\u2019s the lucky sucker, Gen?\u201d\u00a0\u201cHey Bossman, who\u2019s got you smiling like that?\u201d\u00a0\u201cLook at Cupid!\u201d</p><p>Gendry eventually had to leave the crowd hassling him, but had been smiling as he did so. Arya followed him to the hallway leading to the bathroom, his eyes glued to his phone the entire time.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cGendry,\u201d Area said to her friend\u2019s back.<br></p><p>Jumping, Gendry turned around.\u00a0\u201cJesus, Arry,\u201d he grabbed at his chest.\u00a0\u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho are you texting?\u201d Arya wasted no time in asking, her entire self being coasting on adrenaline at this point.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWha- no one!\u201d Gendry\u2019s breathing and deep-set blush gave him away, so Arya pushed farther.<br></p><p>\u201cHot Pie and Sansa have both told me that the past few weeks you\u2019ve been addicted to your phone,\u201d Arya explained.\u00a0\u201cThey think you have some secret girlfriend.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cGirlfriend?\u201d Gendry, if possible, became even more red.<br></p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t believe them at first, but you certainly very attached to your phone right now.\u201d Arya stepped closer and took said phone out of Gendry\u2019s limp hand.

Opening the camera, she held the phone up to get both of them in the shot.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo; he asked her.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Chaning your background, shh.&rdquo; She stuck her tongue out and held up an easy peace sign. &nbsp;Looking at the phone screen, Gendry only laughed at his friend and pulled her closer, his arm wrapping around her shoulders.&nbsp;</p><p>After she showed him how to open his setting and change his background, his arm still loosely laying across her shoulder, Gendry took the phone and tossed it onto his bag that was still lounging in the booth across the table.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Now that that&rsquo;s done, no more phone,&rdquo; said Gendry as he looked down at his friend.&nbsp;&ldquo;You were telling me about fencing practice?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>She smiled as she began retelling the story of how she played Joffery out flat in their practice, enjoying the moment and pushing the idea of girlfriends and texts far from her mind.</p><p>***</p><p>Arya wanted her sister to feel good, but Arya did not understand why they were torturing her to do it.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Arya, sit up nicely,&rdquo; scolded her mother as Arya slouched in the fancily uncomfortable chairs the up-scale dress shoppe had to offer. In celebration of Sansa&rsquo;s graduation from Law school, Cat Stark offered to buy both her daughters new dresses to wear at the dinner party they were to have after the ceremony. At first it was sweet, but it had been three hours and Arya was ready to go.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;How about this one?&rdquo; asked Sansa as she came out in a light pink dress that fell just past her knees. She looked beautiful in it. Just like the other fifteen dresses the girl had tried on.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Oh Sans!&rdquo; their mother cooed again.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Arya watched as the two gossiped and obsessed over the dress, scrolling through her Instagram as she did. She snorted at a post that had scrolled through - someone Indian advertisement for Google - and sent it to Gendry. He responded with a&nbsp;&ldquo;hahaha&rdquo;, which made Arya roll her eyes at how mentally old her friend was sometimes. The she started wondering what he texted his girlfriend - Died he respond the same or did they have long deep conversations?&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Who are you texting?&rdquo; Her mother asked her as Sansa went back to change into the next dress.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Gendry,&rdquo; Arya answered. Her mother made a face, hinting at something. Arya rolled her eyes.&nbsp;&ldquo;Mom, we&rsquo;re just friends!&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I know, I know,&rdquo; Cat calmed her daughter, obviously not believing her.&nbsp;&ldquo;Hey, why don&rsquo;t you invite him to Sansa&rsquo;s graduation dinner?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Arya, he&rsquo;s more than just <i>your</i>&nbsp;friend. Everyone adores him, and he should know that he is welcome to come!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If he comes, though, tell him to leave his phone at home!&rdquo; yelled Sansa from behind the curtain separating her from the dressing room lobby.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;What are you talking about?&rdquo; Arya felt a similar sinking feeling in her chest.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Him, Jon, and I went out the other night and he spent the whole time glued to his phone!&rdquo; Sansa laughed as she came out in a navy blue dress that fit her figure very nicely.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Well the was rude of him,&rdquo; Mrs. Stark spoke up.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Oh no, Mother, it was actually very sweet,&rdquo; Sansa gushed.&nbsp;&ldquo;He would be in the middle of a sentence and would just stop to giggle at his phone!&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Gendry doesn&rsquo;t giggle,&rdquo; said Arya.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Well the closest thing to what Gendry giggling would be,&rdquo; countered Sansa.&nbsp;&ldquo;Who is he texting?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;How should I know?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I mean you are only his best friend.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Well I guess we&rsquo;re not as close as you thought then.&rdquo; Arya grumbled.<br /></p><p>Sansa and her mother exchanged looks before turning back to the annoyed Arya.</p><p>&ldquo;Nonetheless, Rickon misses the boy dearly,&rdquo; said Mrs. Stark.&nbsp;&ldquo;Please ask him to come.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>***</p><p>After Sansa finally agreed on a dress that&nbsp;&ldquo;Felt like her&rdquo;- whatever that meant - the three went to lunch at a pub nearby. Arya had been practically shaking with excitement at the idea that she would have a burger and fries in hand within the hour. Despite the fact Arya was twenty-two, Mrs Stark sent Arya to wash her hands before they ate.</p><p>&ldquo;What, why doesn&rsquo;t Sansa have to?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Because Sansa didn&rsquo;t play with the stray cat outside,&rdquo; her mother responded, unresolving.&nbsp;&ldquo;Go wash your hands.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Grumbling the entire way, Arya made her way to the bathroom. To get there, she had to pass the bar-area of the pub where a large party of people were congregated. Recognizing the grubby and darkened hands, as well as the uniform Stag logo across their mustard-colored shirts, Arya realized that they were all construction workers for Gendry&rsquo;s father&rsquo;s company. Which meant&hellip;</p><p>Eyeing the crowd, her eyes settled on him. Gendry had insisted his father let him work amongst the blue-colored gentlemen and ladies he had admired for so long before he inherited the entire business. And there he was, nestled around the large burly men and women, all laughing after a long-morning of hard work. His hair was damp from sweat, and he was drinking a beer he had probably been nursing longer than any of his coworkers.&nbsp;</p><p>In the briefest of moments, one that only someone truly staring at him as Arya was would notice, Gendry subtly reached into his back pocket and pulled out his phone. His eyebrows knitted together as he sent it onto the table and continued listening to his friends, but with significantly less attention than he had before.&nbsp;</p><p>Arya then pulled her phone and sent a quick text - a picture of the cat she had been playing with earlier.&nbsp;</p><p>Instantly, Gendry&rsquo;s phone screen light up and the man raced to grab it. Arya watched as her friend&rsquo;s face softened and he chuckled to himself. He began to type a bit of text, and then Arya saw the&nbsp;&ldquo;cute&rdquo; of his response pop-up on her phone.&nbsp;</p><p>The bearded ginger man next to Gendry looked at his phone and began poking his side with his elbow. A group of workers around them joined in at the chirping - saying things like&nbsp;&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s the lucky sucker, Gen?&rdquo;&nbsp;&ldquo;Hey Bossman, who&rsquo;s got you smiling like that?&rdquo;&nbsp;&ldquo;Look at Cupid!&rdquo;</p><p>Gendry eventually had to leave the crowd hassling him, but had been smiling as he did so. Arya followed him to the hallway leading to the bathroom, his eyes glued to his phone the entire time.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Gendry,&rdquo; Area said to her friend&rsquo;s back.<br /></p><p>Jumping, Gendry turned around.&nbsp;&ldquo;Jesus, Arry,&rdquo; he grabbed at his chest.&nbsp;&ldquo;What the fuck?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Who are you texting?&rdquo; Arya wasted no time in asking, her entire self being coasting on adrenaline at this point.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Wha- no one!&rdquo; Gendry&rsquo;s breathing and deep-set blush gave him away, so Arya pushed farther.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Hot Pie and Sansa have both told me that the past few weeks you&rsquo;ve been addicted to your phone,&rdquo; Arya explained.&nbsp;&ldquo;They think you have some secret girlfriend.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Girlfriend?&rdquo; Gendry, if possible, became even more red.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t believe them at first, but you certainly very attached to your phone right now.&rdquo; Arya stepped closer and took said phone out of Gendry&rsquo;s limp hand. She looked at the picture the two had taken weeks ago. Studying it now, it was very apparent how comfortable Gendry looked- more comfortable than he did with any of the other girls he had talked to at the bar, and more like how he looked when he had received her texted earlier.&nbsp;&ldquo;Is it me?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Gendry stayed silent, eyes glued to the phone screen Arya had been studying.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Because I like you.&rdquo; She said it casually, but her heart was racing faster than it ever had before.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You what?&rdquo; Gendry looked dup to meet her eyes.<br /></p><p>She only quirked her eyebrow as he studied her face. His eyes followed the movement, slowly circling her features until they landed on her lips.</p><p>&ldquo;Arya-&rdquo; he had said, breathlessly.&nbsp;</p><p>The word was all the encouragement Arya needed. The love drenched in every syllable of her name was too much for her to handle. She surged up meet his mouth with hers and kissed him deeply. His hands cradled her back, immediately responding to her.&nbsp;</p><p>The broke off as quickly as they had begun, both very aware that they were still in a very public area.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;My mother wants you to come to Sansa&rsquo;s graduation dinner,&rdquo; she told him in between breaths.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Do <i>you</i>&nbsp;want me to come?&rdquo; He asked sincerely, but part of him already knowing the answer.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;As your friend or&hellip;&rdquo; His eyes looked hopefully as he asked it. Arya laughed at herself for ever thinking there was ever anyone else. This was Gendry, the boy that would listen to her rants for days on end, who would do anything for her. What other girl could compete?<br /><br />&ldquo;Boyfriend.&rdquo; She said, trying and failing to hold back a smile.&nbsp;<br /></p></p>",

        "body": "<p>She was angry. One of the many things she was feeling at the moment such as pain, fear, sadness, defeat but angry was at the top of her list. She was angry at him. Yes it was completely irrational but she was angry at him. Angry she couldn&rsquo;t find him. Angry that he is possibly dead. Angry that he couldn&rsquo;t stay safe and not get injured , dead or turned into the undead. She had gotten to the boats in the retreat from Winterfell as she, sansa, jon and bran watched their home burn to the ground taking all the wights with it. The battle had been lost with huge casualties and now they were retreating to Dragonstone.</p><p>Once they disembarked from the ships healing stations were set up for the injured and the castle was where everyone went to mourn those lost and to try to regroup even though at the moment they seemed impossible. Arya noted that Jamie, tyrion, brienne, and davos survived but theon, jorah, greyworm and podrick had perished. So many deaths and now they were left with the remains of the lannister army and the unsullied and dothraki. Small numbers. They had lost the battle or in no small words they got their asses kicked. But still Arya was angry because of one person she couldn&rsquo;t find and now assumed he was dead. Bastard you fucking bastard Gendry why couldn&rsquo;t you stay alive! With tears in her eyes she slowly moved up toward the castle to claim a room and mourn the loss of those who died especially mourn the loss of the man she loved.</p><p>As she was walking she noticed the hound, of course that fucker would survive the battle, the hound were survive but Gendry didnt. This pissed off Arya more as she walked past him trying not to glare at him as she did. As she passed him the hound he called out to her. \u201cAh if its not the little assassin girl. I knew you would survive the battle you are too annoying to die. Just like the bloody blacksmith.\u201d Arya turned sharply to him as soon as he mentioned blacksmith and there was only one blacksmith he would be talking about, Gendry. \u201cIf you are looking for the annoying bastard he isn&rsquo;t down here. He went up to the castle courtyard to help set up a new forge. He spent the whole ride here being a pain in my ass and the moment he got off the damn ship he started asking about you. Apparently he didnt seem to care about his injuries. He only wanted to know if you were alive.\u201d As he turned toward Arya he noticed he was talking to no one as she had already taken off to find gendry. The hound shook his head as he figured out why whenever she showed up at the forge at winterfell that work there came to a skidding halt.</p><p>Gendry had limped his way up to the castle courtyard with several other men and located a decent area to rebuild a forge but at the current moment building a new forge was the last thing on their minds. Gendry had disembarked the ship with the hound who he thinks was ready to cleave him in half with the axe he made him but he was done with the hound being an ass to him and being snarky back to him was the only thing he had going for him. Since he was sure if he tried to hit him with his hammer his hammer would break. So snarky and being a pain in his ass was his fall back. As soon as he got off the ship he asked about the starks and the dragon lady to see who survived the fight. He ran into jon snow, sansa and dany as he made his way up to the castle but Arya wasn&rsquo;t with him and no one seemed to know the answer to his question when he asked about arya. There was no way in hell he was going to ask lady sansa or jon snow about arya since that would lead to questions and he would rather get stabbed by a wight again thank you very much. So Gendry limped his way up to the courtyard praying he would see arya on his way there. He had found a spot in the courtyard near a crumbling wall that had some grain sacks and he threw a blanket down and collapsed as his injuries and fatigue of battle finally hit him.</p><p>Arya got to the courtyard as fast as her legs could carry her and injured the pain racing through her leg injury and how her head wound was making her feel dizzy and nauseous but she didnt care he was up here somewhere and she was determined to find him. He was alive and that was all that matter to her at the moment. As she entered the castle courtyard jon and sansa both got to her. \u201cArya you need to rest! You look like you are about to collapse. Healer! I need a healer over here now.\u201d Sansa ordered as she gripped Arya\u2019s arm and jon ducked down to pick her up and carry her to a cot nearby. \u201cI\u2019m fine put me down! I need to find him. I know he is up here some where please put me down and let me find him!\u201d Arya half begged half pleaded as jon lowered her to a cot and a healer came in to attend to her injuries. \u201cWho are you looking for Arya? Find him? whose him?\u201d Sansa questioned as Arya tried to stand while brushing off the hands of the healer. \u201cGendry. I\u2019m looking for Gendry the hound told me he was up here. Sansa please let me find him.\u201d Sansa and jon were shook. Gendry was the blacksmith and jon knew Gendry was Robert Baratheons bastard son. What did this man mean to Arya? or should he be asking why did he mean so much to Arya that she had to find him? Jon didn\u2019t want to think to much on it and pressed Arya back down to the cot. \u201cArya if he is up here I will find him. You stay here with the healers and Sansa I will go find the blacksm&hellip;.. Gendry I will locate him and bring him too you.\u201d Jon stood as he glanced at Sansa indicating to her to keep Arya here as he turned and started to search the courtyard for one man amongst a few hundred.</p><p>Jon moved swiftly as he looked around the courtyard checking on the injured as he passed and ordering healers to those who needed help urgently. He passed by jamie and brienne and nodded to them as they tended to their injuries while the devastating battle took its toll on them. Jon rounded a corner as he looked at more injured and recognized a few men that worked at the forge at winterfell and silently prayed Gendry was amongst them. He wasn\u2019t with them and for a brief moment he feared the hound had lied to Arya about Gendry surviving the fight and if the hound did mistakenly give Arya false hope the hound was about to meet he pointy end of his sword. As he was making that promise he came across a small alcove near the other forge workers and to his utter relief he saw Gendry on sacks of grain passed out and still bleeding from wounds. \u201cI need healers here now! This man needs aid now! You give me a hand we need to get this man over to the healers immediately.\u201d Jon ordered a soldier near him to help carry Gendry to the healers and Arya.</p><p>Sansa heard Jon yell for healers and spun around to see Jon and another man carrying who she assumed was Gendry toward the healers station. She felt Arya move and attempt to get up to try to get to Gendry. \u201cGendry! Please wake up please be ok. Don\u2019t die on me. I just got you back I don\u2019t want to lose you again.\u201d Sansa heard arya saying to him as he was placed on a cot next to her as healers raced to him to look at his wounds that looked terrible. Arya gripped his hand bending her head to his and whispered things to him that Sansa and jon could not hear. Jon and Sansa observed the healers taking care of both of them and Arya refused to let go of Gendry\u2019s hand and didn\u2019t care she was in the way she wasn\u2019t going to leave his side. To Jon\u2019s amazement he noticed Gendry open his eyes as he locked eyes with Arya and Jon heard one word that was barely a whisper but was accompanied by a smile from the blacksmith \u201cArya.\u201d Arya smiled with tears running down her face as she placed a kiss on his forehead as his grip on her hand tightened.</p><p>Hours later as everyone was sleeping or had fallen unconscious due to pain, exhaustion, fatigue and adrenaline wearing off Jon snow wondered the court yard and paused at the healers station where Arya and Gendry were located and he was amazed at what he saw. Arya\u2019s cot was empty as she at some point had crawled onto the one Gendry was on and was curled up next to him or well Gendry was curled around her. Arya\u2019s back was pressed into the chest of Gendry and Gendry\u2019s arms were wrapped around her crushing her to his chest. His one arm was dropped across her waist and the other was wrapped around her shoulders and his face was tucked into the back of her head as her hair half covered his face. Arya\u2019s one hand was gripping his arm wrapped around her waist and her other hand was intertwined with his around her shoulders. Jon could not see their legs underneath the blanket covering them. Arya looked at peace as she slept in the arms of Robert Baratheons bastard son and to Jon\u2019s knowledge he believed that Gendry was the last remaining Baratheon in the seven kingdoms. That was something a lot of people would take interest in. But to Arya he was something else he was important to her and that far more important to Jon because if people found out who Gendry really was his life was in far more danger then he could imagine. Here he was protected from that at the moment and he was needed in the fight against the night king. He was a fighter and he was a blacksmith who could help make weapons to destroy the white walkers. But first they needed to regroup from the battle. High above him the dragons perched on the walls overlooking the castle and its battle wary inhabitants.</p>",

Arya noted that Jamie, tyrion, brienne, and davos survived but theon, jorah, greyworm and podrick had perished. So many deaths and now they were left with the remains of the lannister army and the unsullied and dothraki. Small numbers. They had lost the battle or in no small words they got their asses kicked. But still Arya was angry because of one person she couldn\u2019t find and now assumed he was dead. Bastard you fucking bastard Gendry why couldn\u2019t you stay alive! With tears in her eyes she slowly moved up toward the castle to claim a room and mourn the loss of those who died especially mourn the loss of the man she loved.</p><p>As she was walking she noticed the hound, of course that fucker would survive the battle, the hound were survive but Gendry didnt. This pissed off Arya more as she walked past him trying not to glare at him as she did. As she passed him the hound he called out to her. \u201cAh if its not the little assassin girl. I knew you would survive the battle you are too annoying to die. Just like the bloody blacksmith.\u201d Arya turned sharply to him as soon as he mentioned blacksmith and there was only one blacksmith he would be talking about, Gendry. \u201cIf you are looking for the annoying bastard he isn\u2019t down here. He went up to the castle courtyard to help set up a new forge. He spent the whole ride here being a pain in my ass and the moment he got off the damn ship he started asking about you. Apparently he didnt seem to care about his injuries. He only wanted to know if you were alive.\u201d As he turned toward Arya he noticed he was talking to no one as she had already taken off to find gendry. The hound shook his head as he figured out why whenever she showed up at the forge at winterfell that work there came to a skidding halt.</p><p>Gendry had limped his way up to the castle courtyard with several other men and located a decent area to rebuild a forge but at the current moment building a new forge was the last thing on their minds. Gendry had disembarked the ship with the hound who he thinks was ready to cleave him in half with the axe he made him but he was done with the hound being an ass to him and being snarky back to him was the only thing he had going for him. Since he was sure if he tried to hit him with his hammer his hammer would break. So snarky and being a pain in his ass was his fall back. As soon as he got off the ship he asked about the starks and the dragon lady to see who survived the fight. He ran into jon snow, sansa and dany as he made his way up to the castle but Arya wasn\u2019t with him and no one seemed to know the answer to his question when he asked about arya. There was no way in hell he was going to ask lady sansa or jon snow about arya since that would lead to questions and he would rather get stabbed by a wight again thank you very much. So Gendry limped his way up to the courtyard praying he would see arya on his way there. He had found a spot in the courtyard near a crumbling wall that had some grain sacks and he threw a blanket down and collapsed as his injuries and fatigue of battle finally hit him.</p><p>Arya got to the courtyard as fast as her legs could carry her and injured the pain racing through her leg injury and how her head wound was making her feel dizzy and nauseous but she didnt care he was up here somewhere and she was determined to find him. He was alive and that was all that matter to her at the moment. As she entered the castle courtyard jon and sansa both got to her. \u201cArya you need to rest! You look like you are about to collapse. Healer! I need a healer over here now.\u201d Sansa ordered as she gripped Arya\u2019s arm and jon ducked down to pick her up and carry her to a cot nearby. \u201cI\u2019m fine put me down! I need to find him. I know he is up here some where please put me down and let me find him!\u201d Arya half begged half pleaded as jon lowered her to a cot and a healer came in to attend to her injuries. \u201cWho are you looking for Arya? Find him? whose him?\u201d Sansa questioned as Arya tried to stand while brushing off the hands of the healer. \u201cGendry. I\u2019m looking for Gendry the hound told me he was up here. Sansa please let me find him.\u201d Sansa and jon were shook. Gendry was the blacksmith and jon knew Gendry was Robert Baratheons bastard son. What did this man mean to Arya? or should he be asking why did he mean so much to Arya that she had to find him? Jon didn\u2019t want to think to much on it and pressed Arya back down to the cot. \u201cArya if he is up here I will find him. You stay here with the healers and Sansa I will go find the blacksm\u2026.. Gendry I will locate him and bring him too you.\u201d Jon stood as he glanced at Sansa indicating to her to keep Arya here as he turned and started to search the courtyard for one man amongst a few hundred.</p><p>Jon moved swiftly as he looked around the courtyard checking on the injured as he passed and ordering healers to those who needed help urgently. He passed by jamie and brienne and nodded to them as they tended to their injuries while the devastating battle took its toll on them. Jon rounded a corner as he looked at more injured and recognized a few men that worked at the forge at winterfell and silently prayed Gendry was amongst them. He wasn\u2019t with them and for a brief moment he feared the hound had lied to Arya about Gendry surviving the fight and if the hound did mistakenly give Arya false hope the hound was about to meet he pointy end of his sword. As he was making that promise he came across a small alcove near the other forge workers and to his utter relief he saw Gendry on sacks of grain passed out and still bleeding from wounds. \u201cI need healers here now! This man needs aid now! You give me a hand we need to get this man over to the healers immediately.\u201d Jon ordered a soldier near him to help carry Gendry to the healers and Arya.</p><p>Sansa heard Jon yell for healers and spun around to see Jon and another man carrying who she assumed was Gendry toward the healers station. She felt Arya move and attempt to get up to try to get to Gendry. \u201cGendry! Please wake up please be ok. Don\u2019t die on me. I just got you back I don\u2019t want to lose you again.\u201d Sansa heard arya saying to him as he was placed on a cot next to her as healers raced to him to look at his wounds that looked terrible. Arya gripped his hand bending her head to his and whispered things to him that Sansa and jon could not hear. Jon and Sansa observed the healers taking care of both of them and Arya refused to let go of Gendry\u2019s hand and didn\u2019t care she was in the way she wasn\u2019t going to leave his side. To Jon\u2019s amazement he noticed Gendry open his eyes as he locked eyes with Arya and Jon heard one word that was barely a whisper but was accompanied by a smile from the blacksmith \u201cArya.\u201d Arya smiled with tears running down her face as she placed a kiss on his forehead as his grip on her hand tightened.</p><p>Hours later as everyone was sleeping or had fallen unconscious due to pain, exhaustion, fatigue and adrenaline wearing off Jon snow wondered the court yard and paused at the healers station where Arya and Gendry were located and he was amazed at what he saw. Arya\u2019s cot was empty as she at some point had crawled onto the one Gendry was on and was curled up next to him or well Gendry was curled around her. Arya\u2019s back was pressed into the chest of Gendry and Gendry\u2019s arms were wrapped around her crushing her to his chest. His one arm was dropped across her waist and the other was wrapped around her shoulders and his face was tucked into the back of her head as her hair half covered his face. Arya\u2019s one hand was gripping his arm wrapped around her waist and her other hand was intertwined with his around her shoulders. Jon could not see their legs underneath the blanket covering them. Arya looked at peace as she slept in the arms of Robert Baratheons bastard son and to Jon\u2019s knowledge he believed that Gendry was the last remaining Baratheon in the seven kingdoms. That was something a lot of people would take interest in. But to Arya he was something else he was important to her and that far more important to Jon because if people found out who Gendry really was his life was in far more danger then he could imagine. Here he was protected from that at the moment and he was needed in the fight against the night king. He was a fighter and he was a blacksmith who could help make weapons to destroy the white walkers. But first they needed to regroup from the battle. High above him the dragons perched on the walls overlooking the castle and its battle wary inhabitants.</p>",
                "content": "<p>She was angry. One of the many things she was feeling at the moment such as pain, fear, sadness, defeat but angry was at the top of her list. She was angry at him.
