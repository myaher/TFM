        "body": "<p><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/15241917/chapters/35352096\">Read on ao3</a></p><p>Arya ran up the steps to one of the of the small common homes along the keep&rsquo;s wall. She could hear Clary&rsquo;s friend Simon inside practicing as she banged on the solid wooden door. He stopped abruptly, and scuffling followed before the door flew open.</p><p>Nymeria all but leaped on the musician, causing him to scramble back. &ldquo;Nym, heel.&rdquo; her wolf pup pulled back to sit and she watched Simon tried to retain his dignity as he straightened himself.</p><p>He took her in, brown eyes widening, and bowed immediately in respect. &ldquo;Lady Arya. I&hellip; Why&hellip; Forgive me, m'lady, but what are you doing here? And why alone? Where&rsquo;s Clary?&rdquo;</p><p>Arya felt her rigid posture fall a little, and Nymeria reacted, baring fangs, startling the boy. So he didn&rsquo;t know where Clary had gone either. She pulled her shoulders back again, lifting her chin, a calming hand in her wolf&rsquo;s coat. Simon might be Clary&rsquo;s best friend, but she didn&rsquo;t know him and wasn&rsquo;t about to let him see she was panicking. &ldquo;I actually came to ask you about the night of the feast. You and Clary were dining with Jon, correct?&rdquo;</p><p>He nodded, eyeing Nym fearfully. &ldquo;Yeah, but she kept staring at this empty table, as if she was watching someone or waiting for someone. It was weird. Even for Clary. Jon was being his usually brooding self and she just excused herself, marched up to Lord Bane, interrupting one of his stories, and he led her upstairs to the library. It was all so strange.&rdquo;</p><p>The wolf in Arya bristled at his failure to protect their mutual friend. &ldquo;And you didn&rsquo;t think it strange enough to follow? To investigate?&rdquo;</p><p>Simon at least had the decency to blush. He ran his hand through his messy dark hair. &ldquo;To be honest, m'lady, at first, I thought it was because your brother was being rather rude, if you&rsquo;ll excuse me saying. Once she&rsquo;d left in such a odd way, I had already been called upon to play by the king.&rdquo;</p><p>She let her guard down a bit, causing even Nymeria to sit back and calm. She did recall that bit of the evening. The king had been quite insistent that his new minstrel demonstrate his skills for them all. Simon couldn&rsquo;t have followed Clary if he&rsquo;d wanted to. &ldquo;Very well. One last thing, you said she seemed like she was waiting for someone. Did she mention running into anyone from the king&rsquo;s party? Even in passing?&rdquo;</p><!-- more --><p>The musician shook his head. &ldquo;Not to me, m'lady. But I haven&rsquo;t seen her since they all arrived that night and the feast.&rdquo; Arya watched as the realization and panic filled his eyes. &ldquo;Wait, no one&rsquo;s seen her, have they? Otherwise you would have just asked Luke and known where she was.&rdquo; He paused, &ldquo;M'lady.&rdquo;</p><p>Arya raised a brow at him and his failure at his courtesies. Sansa would have been appalled. &ldquo;All anyone seems to know is she&rsquo;s on some kind of errand with Lord Bane and some of the king&rsquo;s party may or may not have gone with them.&rdquo;</p><p>He disappeared into his small quarters, quickly reappearing with his cloak and hunting horn. He knelt awkwardly, clearly not used to interacting with the nobles. Arya felt she might be able to like him after all. &ldquo;Lady Arya, please let me accompany you to find Clarissa Rivers. I&rsquo;m not a fighter or a tracker, but I know her better than anyone.&rdquo;</p><p>She rolled her eyes. &ldquo;Oh get up. You look ridiculous.&rdquo; Even Nymeria was cocking her head at Simon kneeling awkwardly in his doorway to the scrawny lady. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re helping, we&rsquo;re meeting Jon in the library to see if there&rsquo;s anything there.&rdquo;</p><p>The two she-wolves turned to head back to the keep while the musician nearly tripped on his own cloak in a scramble to get to his feet and follow.</p><hr><p>Daenerys braced herself for the cold as she got out of the steaming water. Aline never shirked away from making it as hot as she liked. The shadowhunter was there, in her black leathers, weapons on display, holding out the fine gown that Dany was to wear for her wedding.</p><p>&ldquo;You are certain you want to do this? We can help you if you don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p><p>Dany stared up into the dark eyes of her guard and new friend. She gingerly lifted the dress. &ldquo;Whatever is meant for me, it is in finding a home. I&rsquo;m not going to find it here. I&rsquo;ve been told my whole life that home is in Westeros, a place I haven&rsquo;t been since I was born and whisked away. You asked me what I want, and I told you the truth. I want to go home. I want to find where it is. I want to find a place that is home.&rdquo;</p><p>Aline nodded and began helping her into the pale dress, clasping the cuffs onto her upper arms. &ldquo;I will be beside you until you find your Idris, princess.&rdquo;</p><p>Daenerys smirked at her. &ldquo;After today, it won&rsquo;t be princess. It will be khaleesi.&rdquo;</p><p>The shadowhunter breathed out a laugh as she worked through her hair, pulling back bits into small braids. &ldquo;Of course, khaleesi.&rdquo;</p><p>Her hair done, dress donned, Dany turned to the mirror. Her brother would say &lsquo;it would have to do,&rsquo; but she knew the dress was finer than any she&rsquo;d ever worn, and her hair looked lovely. &ldquo;You know, nephilim, I do believe a bit of your boldness is having an effect on me.&rdquo; Aline only glanced at her, brow raised. &ldquo;So, in return for this bride gift you have given me, I will give you this advice. Your traditional gear will not be so out of place among the Dothraki. Just lose the sleeves. All they wear is leather. Yours is just black and smoothed out.&rdquo;</p><p>Aline smiled and nodded as they both turned to the group of footfalls they heard approaching. The sun would rise soon and the ceremony would begin. <i>I am the blood of the dragon. A dragon is not afraid.</i></p><p>The door opened and Illyrio and her brother, followed by a group of attendants and sycophants awaited her debut. She allowed the pale gown to trail behind her, the ribbons of material attached to the cuffs on her arms, giving her the feeling of almost having wings.<i> I am the blood of the dragon. A dragon is not afraid.</i></p><p>She was escorted outside the city where the entire khalasar had gathered. Illyrio leaned over to her in the carriage. &ldquo;He has forty thousand riders, nearly ten thousand of which are screamers.&rdquo;</p><p>Viserys grinned viciously. &ldquo;Can you imagine what I could do to the usurper&rsquo;s forces with ten thousand Dothraki screamers?&rdquo;</p><p>Daenerys saw the cruelty in his eyes. &ldquo;Win back our home, and the hearts of our people, of course.&rdquo; She stated it as innocently and stupidly as she could, despite seeing the rage and madness in him that everyone accused their father of. <i>I am the blood of the dragon. A dragon is not afraid.</i></p><p>She was led to a high seat next to the Khal, with the sun rising behind her, the bay behind her, and an entire khalasar spread out before her, dotting the hills nearly as far as she could see. Her brother moved to sit next to her, but was guided to a dais just below her, next to Illyrio and a Westerosi knight. Aline had taken her advice, she was in a leather vest, with leather trousers, and her weapons belt hanging for all to see. Her marks were on full display, up her arms and neck, even on her chest. A few Dothraki glanced at her curiously, but several said khaleesi, and the subject must have been dropped.</p><p>Her new husband clapped his hands and everything was put into motion at once. There was chaotic music, women dancing, food being brought before them - very little of which Dany found herself able to eat. The wedding itself was a blur of women dancing, men mounting them, fighting over them to the death, and mounting new ones.</p><p>It was all far more gruesome than she had been prepared for. She&rsquo;d been told there should be at least three deaths. She didn&rsquo;t expect full disembowelments right in front of her. Her plan had been to try and make conversation with her new husband, based on what she&rsquo;d been studying in all of Illyrio&rsquo;s books. But she found herself struck dumb by the violence the morning brought.</p><p>Noon brought the gifts. Drogo&rsquo;s bloodriders gifted her with the traditional weapons and she spoke the traditional refusals, giving them, instead, to her husband. The strange Westerosi knight swore his fealty to her brother and to her, and offered her a collection of books, as he had learned of her love to read and study. She thanked him and accepted his oath. Even found it in herself to accept the three girls her brother presented as a gift.<i> I am the blood of the dragon. A dragon is not afraid. </i></p><p>Illyrio, as grandiose as ever, brought forth three large chests, one filled with silks and fabrics, one with books she hadn&rsquo;t seen in his library, and the last with three large stones. She stepped forward, drawn to them. He smiled knowingly at her. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re dragons&rsquo; eggs, princess, turned to stone through the years.&rdquo;</p><p>Dany lifted one, gentle with it as if it were a babe, surprised at how warm it was. She eyed the warlock. &ldquo;You could count those years, too, couldn&rsquo;t you, old man?&rdquo; He sputtered some kind of reply but she was entirely focused on the black scaled stone in her hands, laced with red veins. She ran her hand over the other two, one cream and gold, the other green and bronze, soaking in their warmth as she replaced the third.</p><p>Her eyes met the wide ones of Illyrio who looked as though he&rsquo;d been caught in some great scheme. She smiled. &ldquo;I thank you for your remarkable gifts. And I hope you will stay in contact through my attendant, Aline, while I travel to Vaes Dothrak.&rdquo; He bowed and retreated to his seat next to her brother.</p><p>The Khal did not speak to her as he stood, gesturing for her gift from him to be brought forward. A beautiful filly, with an ice-white mane and pale grey hair that appeared almost silver, trotted up to the dais. She was the most beautiful horse Daenerys had ever laid eyes on. Drogo lifted her onto the bare back, clearly expecting her to prove she could ride. Her eyes flicked to Aline and the shadowhunter tapped her inner thighs with the dagger she had in her hands, looking like she&rsquo;d been in some kind of brief skirmish with one of the bloodriders to her side. Dany understood though. She squeezed with her thighs and the silver moved forward. It was exhilarating. Rushing out into the khalasar to whoops and hollers, she allowed the filly to break into a full gallop, feeling like she could be flying, feeling free.<i> I am the blood of the dragon. I can thrive here among these people. </i></p><p>She guided her silver back up to the wedding party, leaping over the great fire to settle before the khal. Her thrill must have shown in her face. He smiled at her.</p><p>She blushed. &ldquo;Yeri zhorre azho anna jin chaf.&rdquo; He smiled again, perhaps at her use of his native tongue, or at her compliment, either way, she was far less nervous about what was to happen now that the sun was setting and his own mount was being brought.</p><p>Dany searched for Aline to give her some reassurance, since this would be one place her guardian could not follow, but the shadowhunter was nowhere to be seen. All the better, she would not be worrying about Dany and her wedding night.</p><p>Drogo set off at a fast pace and Dany and her silver were actually pleased to follow.<i> I am the blood of the dragon and I am not afraid.</i></p><hr><p>&ldquo;How many bloody places can there be for a dwarf to hide in a keep?&rdquo; Jon swore he&rsquo;d searched every crevice of Winterfell. Lord Tyrion Lannister was no where to be found. In fact, none of the Lannisters were around. The king had taken much of the guards and other men out for a hunt in the wolfswood, but Jaime Lannister had declined. It was all the serving girls were talking about - mooning over his golden head and whether or not they might run into him at some point.</p><p>Finally, he made his way down to the kitchens, ready to ask one of Arya&rsquo;s friends - a boy who worked with the baker, when he saw the dwarf sitting at a small table in the corner meant for staff, happily drinking as all the serving staff ignored him nervously.</p><p>He caught sight of Jon and waved him over to the small table, obviously drunk. &ldquo;Ah! Jon, come join me! Did you know, your father does not let a single whore into this entire keep? None! In all of Winterfell! I&rsquo;d have to go to one of the towns outside the keep to find a girl.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon blanched at the subject. &ldquo;How terrible it must be for you, my lord. Now if you wouldn&rsquo;t mind. I&rsquo;d like to ask you about the three you saw my friend Clary leave with the other night.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, you mean the lovely red head. A little young for my liking, but she&rsquo;s certainly beautiful.&rdquo; Tyrion hiccuped. &ldquo;The <i>other </i>one, though. Dark hair, dark eyes, all those tattoos, dressed like she was ready for battle. Now she was a sight.&rdquo;</p><p>That sounded like the kind of woman Jon would remember, drunk or not. &ldquo;But not too young for you, huh?&rdquo; He tried to make his tone sound teasing, not prying.</p><p>&ldquo;Certainly still young, but a woman for certain. I might have even been so bold to talk to her if her brother hadn&rsquo;t been there, watching Lord Bane like he was ready to murder. Or that golden boy. That one looked like he and Jaime could be long lost brothers.&rdquo; Tyrion spit the last bit out with venom.</p><p>Jon had their descriptions. But not why no one else saw them. &ldquo;Tyrion, why did no one else see them?&rdquo;</p><p>Lannister just shrugged, slurring his words. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way things have always been. I can see things I&rsquo;m not supposed to. Ever since I was a child. Everyone just said I was playing pretend, then I learned to just not say anything at all. Except that woman. She rode in the carriage with Myrcella. So she&rsquo;s not always invisible to everyone. I don&rsquo;t know. Lightwood, I think was the name. Yeah. That&rsquo;s the name Cercei kept spitting over and over. Something about 'how dare Lady Maryse presume to use her influence in such a way&rsquo; or some other self-righteous tantrum.&rdquo;</p><p>He was starting to piece things together. Slowly, maybe. Some of Old Nan&rsquo;s stories talked about warriors of the old gods who marked themselves to gain power of the gods, who were more than human, but the First Men were gifted by the Children of the Forest with the ability to see them. It was called the Sight. Maybe some legends were true.</p><p>&ldquo;So these Lightwoods, can be visible when they want to, you have the Sight - so you can see them either way, and they used their influence to join your group north, to speak to Lord Bane, somehow Clary is involved, and now they&rsquo;ve all disappeared.&rdquo; Jon pressed his palms to his forehead. Deduction was not his area of expertise.</p><p>Tyrion suddenly spoke clearly. &ldquo;See I&rsquo;d gotten that far on my own, thank you. In fact, I&rsquo;d realized Clary had nothing to do with the Lightwood siblings until they got here, purely based on her father&rsquo;s reaction to the name. But he certainly knows something about the family. His eyes glowed green at the mere mention of it.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon&rsquo;s head shot up. &ldquo;What? I didn&rsquo;t see that!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I have the Sight, you don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well it hardly matters right now, anyway. We can&rsquo;t ask Luke anything while he&rsquo;s out hunting with Lord Stark and the king.&rdquo; Jon rested his head back on his palms, elbows propped on the table.</p><p>Tyrion took another long drink of his wine, setting the empty cup down loudly. &ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t matter. They weren&rsquo;t here for your pretty little redhead. They were here for Bane. What&rsquo;s so special about your failed maester-turned-apothecary? Other than he weaves better tales than even I do, of course.&rdquo;</p><p>Lord Bane was eccentric, for sure, but Jon had never noticed anything out of the ordinary for someone who experimented in science and medicine. &ldquo;Nothing that I can tell. He&rsquo;s been here as long as any of us can remember, is extravagant in his tastes, and expensive in his practice.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How long has he been here?&rdquo; Tyrion frowned.</p><p>&ldquo;Since Robert&rsquo;s Rebellion, I think. He moved north about the same time Clary&rsquo;s family did.&rdquo;</p><p>Tyrion shook his head. &ldquo;That man doesn&rsquo;t look old enough to have been around since Robert&rsquo;s Rebellion.&rdquo;</p><p>Now that he mentioned it, Bane did appear young, perhaps only one-and-twenty. &ldquo;Maybe it&rsquo;s some of the medicines and potions he&rsquo;s using?&rdquo;</p><p>Lannister stood, his legs appearing stiff as Jon watched him wince. &ldquo;I suppose the only way to know is to check his library and see what sort of strange things he keeps there.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon ran a hand through his hair. &ldquo;How convenient, I&rsquo;m meeting Arya there to search shortly.&rdquo;</p><p>The dwarf of Lannister grinned up at him. &ldquo;Good. Bring your wolf.&rdquo;</p><hr><p>Helen was pacing. The Volantis Institute, with its solid walls and few windows, was ill-suited to her fae nature. Quaithe watched as the girl took out her agitation on the path she was wearing into the floor. They could leave anytime they wanted, of course, and the Shadowhunters knew it, but they needed answers, and Jia seemed to know where the new dragon was.</p><p>&ldquo;We could always occupy ourselves. Cause a little havoc, get their attention?&rdquo; Quaithe&rsquo;s smooth voice halted Helen&rsquo;s trek around the room for the thousandth time.</p><p>She grinned a true fae grin. &ldquo;What did you have in mind?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh nothing too devastating, just some simple training like we used to when you were younger. I&rsquo;ll attack with my destructive magic, you negate it with your natural magic. Should be fun, considering how much you&rsquo;ve grown in your skills.&rdquo; Quaithe tilted her head, lacquered veil shifting with her, revealing only her bright silver eyes.</p><p>Helen plucked one of the flowers from her hair, allowing it to grow and weave its way around her arm, twisting into a bracer. Quaithe stood, shifting the table and chairs out of their way with a wave of her hand. She flicked her hand toward the fae girl, black flames surrounding her, low and smoldering.</p><p>A cool breeze blew in, like fresh snow, and the flames exploded into the air bringing a bright snowfall with them.</p><p>&ldquo;Now you&rsquo;re just showing off. It would have taken half the energy to created rain, even less a rain of blossoms or something similar. Or even better - you could have just drown it in ash.&rdquo;</p><p>The blonde stared up into her snowfall, flakes dotting her hair. &ldquo;But I thought we were having fun? Snow is more fun. Rain would ruin my hair.&rdquo;</p><p>Greens and blues flickered through the black of her hair as she shook her head at the girl. &ldquo;You will learn the value of conserving your energy, child. Even mine, with pure blood of Old Valyria, is not limitless.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Fine. A new game then. Who can outmatch the other using the least energy. &rdquo; Mischief flickered in Helen&rsquo;s blue-green eyes. The same eyes that the Blackthorn man wore with such sorrow.</p><p>The Valyrian removed her mask, allowing it to evaporate in silver wisps. &ldquo;Very well. But I have dealt with your kinds&rsquo; games before. Do not think you can best me with simple fairy tricks, girl.&rdquo;</p><p>Helen smiled sweetly. &ldquo;I would never dream of such a thing, Mistress Quaithe.&rdquo; The flowering vine wrapped around her wrist loosened, dropping two metal objects to the floor. The girl bent gracefully to grab them, the larger in her left and the smaller in her right.</p><p>Quaithe cursed in Valyrian. Helen was holding a stele and a seraph blade, smirking at her master&rsquo;s obvious surprise.</p><p>&ldquo;Stealing should have been made off limits.&rdquo;</p><p>The doors opened, admitting Jia and Andrew, who paused to take in the scene. Jia stared at the weapons Helen was holding. &ldquo;I must say, I agree. The Clave does frown upon stealing, although it is nice to see another Blackthorn wielding a blade.&rdquo;</p><p>Andrew just looked concerned. &ldquo;Is everything alright here?&rdquo;</p><p>Quiathe turned her back to Helen, facing the two shadowhunters. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re just training. Something to pass the time.&rdquo; She heard the girl move before their eyes even caught the movement. She flicked her wrist and a barrier prevented Helen from passing to complete her attack. Quaithe turned to poke at the barrier right above where Helen was glaring, trapped on the other side of the room. &ldquo;I told you, minimal energy. You tried to lure me into hand-to-hand combat with weapons that you know can injure me. So I used your angel blood against you. I can walk through this barrier, but nothing angelic can pass.&rdquo;</p><p>Jia stepped up to the barrier, curious. &ldquo;Strange. It takes warlocks immense preparation and energy to conjure this kind of ward.&rdquo;</p><p>Andrew put his hand on the barrier, as solid for him as it was for his daughter. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s because blood magic isn&rsquo;t natural for warlocks. Their magic is demonic in nature. Lady Quaithe is draconian. Her magic is of nature - fire and blood. That&rsquo;s where the saying comes from, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p><p>She lowered her hand and the barrier evaporated into flakes of silver, drifting to the floor like Helen&rsquo;s snowfall had before. &ldquo;You are mostly correct. It runs deeper than that, but that&rsquo;s an easy way to understand it.&rdquo;</p><p>Jia turned to face the rest of the room. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the Targaryen girl. A warlock contacted me about her and begged me to give her protection. I couldn&rsquo;t take it to the Clave because I had no way to say what she was, but it was clear she wasn&rsquo;t mundane - immune to heat, had the Sight, never been sick. She has no warlock mark, no magic that we can see, and she&rsquo;s in the care of her mad brother who wants to trade her for an army. I did what I could - I sent a shadowhunter to be her guard. But she&rsquo;s not what you are.&rdquo;</p><p>Quaithe shook her head. &ldquo;None of the Targaryens ever were. Some of my kind were born as dragons, some as I am, some with the ability to shift between. But our blood runs in that girl&rsquo;s veins, the blood of dragons. A single shadowhunter can only protect her so long as no one knows what she is.&rdquo;</p><p>Blackthorn paled. &ldquo;What would happen if someone knew what she was and sought to use her blood for some kind of magic?&rdquo;</p><p>Silver eyes flashed. She knew what he was asking. &ldquo;With the right dragon&rsquo;s blood and the right spell, someone could become as powerful as I am, infused with the magic of blood and fire, able to bring about the next Doom. If Valentine had successfully gotten to Rhaegar he would have brought about the end of all of us with non-angelic blood.&rdquo;</p><p>She could feel Helen&rsquo;s anger radiating, forcing her to motion. &ldquo;You and your Clave only ever cared about containing your Uprising. You did nothing to stop the genocide he committed against the last of their line. An entire race - decimated! The dragons - gone! What would we do if Rhaegar really was the last? Allow that magic to slip away from the world? Do you have any idea what is-&rdquo;</p><p>Quaithe shushed her. The Clave didn&rsquo;t need to know what the flames saw. They weren&rsquo;t ready. &ldquo;You said she had a shadowhunter with her. I assume that means you&rsquo;re receiving fire messages.&rdquo;</p><p>Jia nodded, pulling the folded, singed paper from a pocket in her leathers. Quaithe ran her hand along the edge, gathering the burned remains on her fingers. The ash whispered of grass and wind and open air. Some deep, primal part of her ached to fly.</p><p>Jia shuffled her feet, almost nervously. &ldquo;The shadowhunter with the princess is my daughter, Aline. She will not trust you and will view you as a threat, even if you take her,&rdquo; she nodded toward Helen, &ldquo;with you. Tell her to ask you the question, to which you will answer 'Only a pen.&rsquo; It&rsquo;s a bit of a joke. But she will know I sent you.&rdquo;</p><p>Quaithe nodded as she made her way up the steps, still rubbing the ash between her fingers, her mind picturing the exact place she was about to portal to. She could hear Helen saying an awkward farewell to her father, promising to visit the Institute in Dorne soon, and that she would send a fire message as soon as she was able.</p><p>As soon as the fae girl was by her side, the Valyrian blew the ash into the air, letting it shimmer as she moved her hands around it until the heat in the air was so intense, the air itself seemed to solidify into black glass, streaked with green and purple veins.</p><p>Helen holstered her stolen seraph blade and drew a few runes before tucking the stele away too. It wouldn&rsquo;t do to greet a suspicious shadowhunter and not look like a fellow nephilim. They walked through together, hearing the shattering of the thin glass behind them as they did.</p><p>The sun was high on the plains of the Great Grass Sea, and the cacophony of a khalasar was enough to drive anyone with mundane senses mad, much less Quaithe&rsquo;s Valyrian senses. Instinctively, her mask was back over her face, her hair and eyes glamoured, using much of her ability to maintain and suppress her magic.</p><p>Helen glanced around them, taking in the revelries they&rsquo;d stepped out into. &ldquo;It would appear you&rsquo;ve portaled us straight into a Dothraki wedding, Mistress.&rdquo; Their entrance appeared to have gone unnoticed, as they were behind what seemed to be an outcropping of rock, hidden from the high dais, where it would appear the newly married couple sat.</p><p>Quaithe took one look at the girl, silver hair flowing and violet eyes hiding a strength no one around seemed to see, and her own blood seemed to boil. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s her. I can sense her fire from here.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s great. How about we deal with this first, not that I&rsquo;m complaining or anything.&rdquo;</p><p>She turned to see Helen with a glowing seraph blade at her throat, a young shadowhunter who could only be Aline, immobilizing her.</p><p>The Valyrian removed her glamour and veil, almost in exasperation. &ldquo;Ask your question, Penhallow.&rdquo;</p><p>Aline stiffened, the blade twitching at Helen&rsquo;s throat. &ldquo;What will always defeat the blade?&rdquo;</p><p>Quaithe laughed. Jia was right, it was a bit of a joke. She flicked an unglamoured, taloned hand toward the two nephilim, taking Helen&rsquo;s stele from where it was tucked into her loose robes. She held up the adamas item so Aline could see it clearly. &ldquo;Only a pen.&rdquo;</p><hr><p>Clary was beyond a loss for what was happening in front of her. The gigantic man who had claimed to be a wolf, or skinchanger, or whatever, was staring down at Lord Bane, almost with hesitation. Magnus held out his hand and the big wildling grasped his forearm, widening his stance as if prepared for pain. </p><p>She watched the man she only knew as a librarian and minor healer wave his hands, creating an aura of power around the two of them. Her attention was torn from the scene when Isabelle hissed in pain, grabbing at her own forearm. A knowing look passed between the two Lightwood boys and Alec went to Izzy immediately, speaking too quiet for Clary to hear. </p><p>Jace stepped near to her, pulling that pen-brand thing out again and waving it loosely in his hands. &ldquo;Bane activated our own memory runes so that we&rsquo;ll be able to see what he sees. I can give you the rune if you want, but I don&rsquo;t plan on marking you any more than you&rsquo;re prepared to handle. Earlier, I really just didn&rsquo;t plan to let you freeze.&rdquo; He shrugged and gave her a cocky smile, but it came off a bit more like a grimace. </p><p>She lifted her sleeve to reveal the heat rune, determination in the way she shoved her wrist at him. &ldquo;I told you, if it affects the safety of the family I serve, I have a right to know.&rdquo;</p><p>He seemed to evaluate her for a moment, looking her over with his mismatched eyes that somehow only made him more attractive. Or would, if he ever stopped acting so bloody arrogant. He took another step closer to her, holding her forearm firmly as if he expected her to jerk away. &ldquo;This is going to hurt, but we don&rsquo;t want to give away what the warlock is doing, so don&rsquo;t cry out.&rdquo;</p><p>Clary shot him an annoyed glare. She watched after direwolves, reigned in wild ladies, and trained for an unknown battle in secret with her mother. She wasn&rsquo;t some soft girl who fainted at the sight of blood. &ldquo;Get on with it or we might miss something important.&rdquo;</p><p>His golden hair reflected the fire in the tent as he shook his head, chuckling. &ldquo;Alec and Izzy have that covered,&rdquo; he gestured over his shoulder where the two had taken a seat, appearing to watch the process intently. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re just joining the party a bit late. Okay, brace yourself.&rdquo;</p><p>She stared past him at Magnus and the big man - Tormund. This whole thing was something that she&rsquo;d just accidentally wandered into and now part of it was searing into her skin, marking her as its own. Looks like you&rsquo;re one of us, Isabelle had said. Jace was right, this hurt worse than the other one. She focused on the memory of running into the group on the stairway, Nymeria nearly bowling Jace over, and the dumbfounded look on his face when he realized she could see him. She could see this world, could take the marks of these Shadowhunters, and maybe even share in the memories of this warlock and skinchanger. Just yesterday her biggest secret had been that she was as good a swordsman as Jon. </p><p>&ldquo;Done.&rdquo;</p><p>She glanced down at her arm, at the strange shape of the rune that could be an letter of some kind, but maybe a design of some kind? She wasn&rsquo;t sure, but she could feel the power it brought, feel the draw of the warlock&rsquo;s power. Somehow, she new what Magnus&rsquo; magic felt like. &ldquo;That wasn&rsquo;t nearly as bad as you made it seem.&rdquo;</p><p>He held out an arm, leading her to sit next to his siblings. &ldquo;Yes, well, you appear to be much tougher than the average mundane.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I thought I&rsquo;d made that rather clear. The strength of your skepticism is the true surprise here, Jace Wayland.&rdquo; Clary sat gracefully, as she&rsquo;d learned in the lessons with Arya and the Septa, not allowing him a chance to respond. </p><p>He huffed in annoyance as he sat next to her, leaning across her to touch the metal pen to the rune he&rsquo;d just marked, causing it to glow with a golden light and her mind to rush with images that were flooding from Magnus&rsquo; mind as it was linked to the skinchanger&rsquo;s. </p><p><i>A whole group of wildlings are huddled in this space, nuzzling close together, not lighting a fire, not wanting to draw attention to their family. No, family is the wrong word - Pack. They are pack. Some are in their mundane form, some are wolf, some are in-between with claws and fur on their face, eyes glowing when they open them. Their scent is all over this hut. It is time to go before something tracks them. He tells them to move. No one is happy, least of all his girls. They liked having a place to just spend with the pack. They liked to be able to stay wolf. Out in the woods, it&rsquo;s not safe. He keeps his pack as mundanes. </i></p><p><i>There&rsquo;s a village, but no smoke, no smell of mundanes, no sound of heartbeats. Just a sense of death. The girls don&rsquo;t like it, they want to go around, or double back and go back to the hut. But he wants to find safety, find some kind of alliance - another pack, another clan - anything, to keep the pack safe and together. He should have listened to the girls. They always did have better sense than him. They whimpered as they followed into the village. Everything was wrong. There were bodies but none of the wolves could smell blood. It all just smelled of ice and cold. It didn&rsquo;t smell like death, just felt like it. His pack spread out, searching for answers, for survivors. A bite could save an injured ally, it was their way. No survivors, just the bodies, strewn in a spiral. To wolves, the spiral means revenge. Gods only know what it means to these ice demons. </i></p><p><i>As we were divided, they stood, not a sound. Not even he, as the alpha, could hear their movements. But he could hear the screams of his pack - of his girls - as they were torn apart. He found them with throats ripped out, arms and legs torn off, and was attacked by the blue-eyed dead. His change to a great red wolf was seamless and he tossed them about like rag dolls. Until their master arrived - some great creature made of nothing but ice and bone. It screeched and he turned and saw his girls get up, still bloody and torn, eyes glowing blue instead of green, and move to attack him - their father and alpha. </i></p><p><i>He roared in rage, but it was to deaf ears. They weren&rsquo;t his wolves anymore. The grief and pain, the agony of the loss and trauma kept him a wolf. He stalked the woods, turning a new pack, more vicious and ready to fight than the other. Until he saw the full army of the dead. He and his new pack were far north, in the everwinter, piled in a safe cave, when it all passed by underneath them. Thousands of the creatures, all ranging in size - some beyond recognition of what they once were, others in various states of decay. All led by those ice demons who spoke only in screeches. North wasn&rsquo;t safe. He had to get his pack south, away from these things, as far south as they could get. He wouldn&rsquo;t lose anymore wolves to these bastards.</i></p><p><i>He wouldn&rsquo;t be caught in a war where his daughters were mindless pawns in the hands of demons. It was time to find a way out.</i></p>",

Once she\u2019d left in such a odd way, I had already been called upon to play by the king.\u201d</p><p>She let her guard down a bit, causing even Nymeria to sit back and calm. She did recall that bit of the evening. The king had been quite insistent that his new minstrel demonstrate his skills for them all. Simon couldn\u2019t have followed Clary if he\u2019d wanted to. \u201cVery well. One last thing, you said she seemed like she was waiting for someone. Did she mention running into anyone from the king\u2019s party? Even in passing?\u201d</p>[[MORE]]<p>The musician shook his head. \u201cNot to me, m'lady. But I haven\u2019t seen her since they all arrived that night and the feast.\u201d Arya watched as the realization and panic filled his eyes. \u201cWait, no one\u2019s seen her, have they? Otherwise you would have just asked Luke and known where she was.\u201d He paused, \u201cM'lady.\u201d</p><p>Arya raised a brow at him and his failure at his courtesies. Sansa would have been appalled. \u201cAll anyone seems to know is she\u2019s on some kind of errand with Lord Bane and some of the king\u2019s party may or may not have gone with them.\u201d</p><p>He disappeared into his small quarters, quickly reappearing with his cloak and hunting horn. He knelt awkwardly, clearly not used to interacting with the nobles. Arya felt she might be able to like him after all. \u201cLady Arya, please let me accompany you to find Clarissa Rivers. I\u2019m not a fighter or a tracker, but I know her better than anyone.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes. \u201cOh get up. You look ridiculous.\u201d Even Nymeria was cocking her head at Simon kneeling awkwardly in his doorway to the scrawny lady. \u201cIf you\u2019re helping, we\u2019re meeting Jon in the library to see if there\u2019s anything there.\u201d</p><p>The two she-wolves turned to head back to the keep while the musician nearly tripped on his own cloak in a scramble to get to his feet and follow.</p><hr><p>Daenerys braced herself for the cold as she got out of the steaming water. Aline never shirked away from making it as hot as she liked. The shadowhunter was there, in her black leathers, weapons on display, holding out the fine gown that Dany was to wear for her wedding.</p><p>\u201cYou are certain you want to do this? We can help you if you don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Dany stared up into the dark eyes of her guard and new friend. She gingerly lifted the dress. \u201cWhatever is meant for me, it is in finding a home. I\u2019m not going to find it here. I\u2019ve been told my whole life that home is in Westeros, a place I haven\u2019t been since I was born and whisked away. You asked me what I want, and I told you the truth. I want to go home. I want to find where it is. I want to find a place that is home.\u201d</p><p>Aline nodded and began helping her into the pale dress, clasping the cuffs onto her upper arms. \u201cI will be beside you until you find your Idris, princess.\u201d</p><p>Daenerys smirked at her. \u201cAfter today, it won\u2019t be princess. It will be khaleesi.\u201d</p><p>The shadowhunter breathed out a laugh as she worked through her hair, pulling back bits into small braids. \u201cOf course, khaleesi.\u201d</p><p>Her hair done, dress donned, Dany turned to the mirror. Her brother would say \u2018it would have to do,\u2019 but she knew the dress was finer than any she\u2019d ever worn, and her hair looked lovely. \u201cYou know, nephilim, I do believe a bit of your boldness is having an effect on me.\u201d Aline only glanced at her, brow raised. \u201cSo, in return for this bride gift you have given me, I will give you this advice. Your traditional gear will not be so out of place among the Dothraki. Just lose the sleeves. All they wear is leather. Yours is just black and smoothed out.\u201d</p><p>Aline smiled and nodded as they both turned to the group of footfalls they heard approaching. The sun would rise soon and the ceremony would begin. <i>I am the blood of the dragon. A dragon is not afraid.</i></p><p>The door opened and Illyrio and her brother, followed by a group of attendants and sycophants awaited her debut. She allowed the pale gown to trail behind her, the ribbons of material attached to the cuffs on her arms, giving her the feeling of almost having wings.<i> I am the blood of the dragon. A dragon is not afraid.</i></p><p>She was escorted outside the city where the entire khalasar had gathered. Illyrio leaned over to her in the carriage. \u201cHe has forty thousand riders, nearly ten thousand of which are screamers.\u201d</p><p>Viserys grinned viciously. \u201cCan you imagine what I could do to the usurper\u2019s forces with ten thousand Dothraki screamers?\u201d</p><p>Daenerys saw the cruelty in his eyes. \u201cWin back our home, and the hearts of our people, of course.\u201d She stated it as innocently and stupidly as she could, despite seeing the rage and madness in him that everyone accused their father of. <i>I am the blood of the dragon. A dragon is not afraid.</i></p><p>She was led to a high seat next to the Khal, with the sun rising behind her, the bay behind her, and an entire khalasar spread out before her, dotting the hills nearly as far as she could see. Her brother moved to sit next to her, but was guided to a dais just below her, next to Illyrio and a Westerosi knight. Aline had taken her advice, she was in a leather vest, with leather trousers, and her weapons belt hanging for all to see. Her marks were on full display, up her arms and neck, even on her chest. A few Dothraki glanced at her curiously, but several said khaleesi, and the subject must have been dropped.</p><p>Her new husband clapped his hands and everything was put into motion at once. There was chaotic music, women dancing, food being brought before them - very little of which Dany found herself able to eat. The wedding itself was a blur of women dancing, men mounting them, fighting over them to the death, and mounting new ones.</p><p>It was all far more gruesome than she had been prepared for. She\u2019d been told there should be at least three deaths. She didn\u2019t expect full disembowelments right in front of her. Her plan had been to try and make conversation with her new husband, based on what she\u2019d been studying in all of Illyrio\u2019s books. But she found herself struck dumb by the violence the morning brought.</p><p>Noon brought the gifts. Drogo\u2019s bloodriders gifted her with the traditional weapons and she spoke the traditional refusals, giving them, instead, to her husband. The strange Westerosi knight swore his fealty to her brother and to her, and offered her a collection of books, as he had learned of her love to read and study. She thanked him and accepted his oath. Even found it in herself to accept the three girls her brother presented as a gift.<i> I am the blood of the dragon. A dragon is not afraid. </i></p><p>Illyrio, as grandiose as ever, brought forth three large chests, one filled with silks and fabrics, one with books she hadn\u2019t seen in his library, and the last with three large stones. She stepped forward, drawn to them. He smiled knowingly at her. \u201cThey\u2019re dragons\u2019 eggs, princess, turned to stone through the years.\u201d</p><p>Dany lifted one, gentle with it as if it were a babe, surprised at how warm it was. She eyed the warlock. \u201cYou could count those years, too, couldn\u2019t you, old man?\u201d He sputtered some kind of reply but she was entirely focused on the black scaled stone in her hands, laced with red veins. She ran her hand over the other two, one cream and gold, the other green and bronze, soaking in their warmth as she replaced the third.</p><p>Her eyes met the wide ones of Illyrio who looked as though he\u2019d been caught in some great scheme. She smiled. \u201cI thank you for your remarkable gifts. And I hope you will stay in contact through my attendant, Aline, while I travel to Vaes Dothrak.\u201d He bowed and retreated to his seat next to her brother.</p><p>The Khal did not speak to her as he stood, gesturing for her gift from him to be brought forward. A beautiful filly, with an ice-white mane and pale grey hair that appeared almost silver, trotted up to the dais. She was the most beautiful horse Daenerys had ever laid eyes on. Drogo lifted her onto the bare back, clearly expecting her to prove she could ride. Her eyes flicked to Aline and the shadowhunter tapped her inner thighs with the dagger she had in her hands, looking like she\u2019d been in some kind of brief skirmish with one of the bloodriders to her side. Dany understood though. She squeezed with her thighs and the silver moved forward. It was exhilarating. Rushing out into the khalasar to whoops and hollers, she allowed the filly to break into a full gallop, feeling like she could be flying, feeling free.<i> I am the blood of the dragon. I can thrive here among these people. </i></p><p>She guided her silver back up to the wedding party, leaping over the great fire to settle before the khal. Her thrill must have shown in her face. He smiled at her.</p><p>She blushed. \u201cYeri zhorre azho anna jin chaf.\u201d He smiled again, perhaps at her use of his native tongue, or at her compliment, either way, she was far less nervous about what was to happen now that the sun was setting and his own mount was being brought.</p><p>Dany searched for Aline to give her some reassurance, since this would be one place her guardian could not follow, but the shadowhunter was nowhere to be seen. All the better, she would not be worrying about Dany and her wedding night.</p><p>Drogo set off at a fast pace and Dany and her silver were actually pleased to follow.<i> I am the blood of the dragon and I am not afraid.</i></p><hr><p>\u201cHow many bloody places can there be for a dwarf to hide in a keep?\u201d Jon swore he\u2019d searched every crevice of Winterfell. Lord Tyrion Lannister was no where to be found. In fact, none of the Lannisters were around. The king had taken much of the guards and other men out for a hunt in the wolfswood, but Jaime Lannister had declined. It was all the serving girls were talking about - mooning over his golden head and whether or not they might run into him at some point.</p><p>Finally, he made his way down to the kitchens, ready to ask one of Arya\u2019s friends - a boy who worked with the baker, when he saw the dwarf sitting at a small table in the corner meant for staff, happily drinking as all the serving staff ignored him nervously.</p><p>He caught sight of Jon and waved him over to the small table, obviously drunk. \u201cAh! Jon, come join me! Did you know, your father does not let a single whore into this entire keep? None! In all of Winterfell! I\u2019d have to go to one of the towns outside the keep to find a girl.\u201d</p><p>Jon blanched at the subject. \u201cHow terrible it must be for you, my lord. Now if you wouldn\u2019t mind. I\u2019d like to ask you about the three you saw my friend Clary leave with the other night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you mean the lovely red head. A little young for my liking, but she\u2019s certainly beautiful.\u201d Tyrion hiccuped. \u201cThe <i>other </i>one, though. Dark hair, dark eyes, all those tattoos, dressed like she was ready for battle. Now she was a sight.\u201d</p><p>That sounded like the kind of woman Jon would remember, drunk or not. \u201cBut not too young for you, huh?\u201d He tried to make his tone sound teasing, not prying.</p><p>\u201cCertainly still young, but a woman for certain. I might have even been so bold to talk to her if her brother hadn\u2019t been there, watching Lord Bane like he was ready to murder. Or that golden boy. That one looked like he and Jaime could be long lost brothers.\u201d Tyrion spit the last bit out with venom.</p><p>Jon had their descriptions. But not why no one else saw them. \u201cTyrion, why did no one else see them?\u201d</p><p>Lannister just shrugged, slurring his words. \u201cThat\u2019s the way things have always been. I can see things I\u2019m not supposed to. Ever since I was a child. Everyone just said I was playing pretend, then I learned to just not say anything at all. Except that woman. She rode in the carriage with Myrcella. So she\u2019s not always invisible to everyone. I don\u2019t know. Lightwood, I think was the name. Yeah. That\u2019s the name Cercei kept spitting over and over. Something about 'how dare Lady Maryse presume to use her influence in such a way\u2019 or some other self-righteous tantrum.\u201d</p><p>He was starting to piece things together. Slowly, maybe. Some of Old Nan\u2019s stories talked about warriors of the old gods who marked themselves to gain power of the gods, who were more than human, but the First Men were gifted by the Children of the Forest with the ability to see them. It was called the Sight. Maybe some legends were true.</p><p>\u201cSo these Lightwoods, can be visible when they want to, you have the Sight - so you can see them either way, and they used their influence to join your group north, to speak to Lord Bane, somehow Clary is involved, and now they\u2019ve all disappeared.\u201d Jon pressed his palms to his forehead. Deduction was not his area of expertise.</p><p>Tyrion suddenly spoke clearly. \u201cSee I\u2019d gotten that far on my own, thank you. In fact, I\u2019d realized Clary had nothing to do with the Lightwood siblings until they got here, purely based on her father\u2019s reaction to the name. But he certainly knows something about the family. His eyes glowed green at the mere mention of it.\u201d</p><p>Jon\u2019s head shot up. \u201cWhat? I didn\u2019t see that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have the Sight, you don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell it hardly matters right now, anyway. We can\u2019t ask Luke anything while he\u2019s out hunting with Lord Stark and the king.\u201d Jon rested his head back on his palms, elbows propped on the table.</p><p>Tyrion took another long drink of his wine, setting the empty cup down loudly. \u201cDoesn\u2019t matter. They weren\u2019t here for your pretty little redhead. They were here for Bane. What\u2019s so special about your failed maester-turned-apothecary? Other than he weaves better tales than even I do, of course.\u201d</p><p>Lord Bane was eccentric, for sure, but Jon had never noticed anything out of the ordinary for someone who experimented in science and medicine. \u201cNothing that I can tell. He\u2019s been here as long as any of us can remember, is extravagant in his tastes, and expensive in his practice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long has he been here?\u201d Tyrion frowned.</p><p>\u201cSince Robert\u2019s Rebellion, I think. He moved north about the same time Clary\u2019s family did.\u201d</p><p>Tyrion shook his head. \u201cThat man doesn\u2019t look old enough to have been around since Robert\u2019s Rebellion.\u201d</p><p>Now that he mentioned it, Bane did appear young, perhaps only one-and-twenty. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s some of the medicines and potions he\u2019s using?\u201d</p><p>Lannister stood, his legs appearing stiff as Jon watched him wince. \u201cI suppose the only way to know is to check his library and see what sort of strange things he keeps there.\u201d</p><p>Jon ran a hand through his hair. \u201cHow convenient, I\u2019m meeting Arya there to search shortly.\u201d</p><p>The dwarf of Lannister grinned up at him. \u201cGood. Bring your wolf.\u201d</p><hr><p>Helen was pacing. The Volantis Institute, with its solid walls and few windows, was ill-suited to her fae nature. Quaithe watched as the girl took out her agitation on the path she was wearing into the floor. They could leave anytime they wanted, of course, and the Shadowhunters knew it, but they needed answers, and Jia seemed to know where the new dragon was.</p><p>\u201cWe could always occupy ourselves. Cause a little havoc, get their attention?\u201d Quaithe\u2019s smooth voice halted Helen\u2019s trek around the room for the thousandth time.</p><p>She grinned a true fae grin. \u201cWhat did you have in mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh nothing too devastating, just some simple training like we used to when you were younger. I\u2019ll attack with my destructive magic, you negate it with your natural magic. Should be fun, considering how much you\u2019ve grown in your skills.\u201d Quaithe tilted her head, lacquered veil shifting with her, revealing only her bright silver eyes.</p><p>Helen plucked one of the flowers from her hair, allowing it to grow and weave its way around her arm, twisting into a bracer. Quaithe stood, shifting the table and chairs out of their way with a wave of her hand. She flicked her hand toward the fae girl, black flames surrounding her, low and smoldering.</p><p>A cool breeze blew in, like fresh snow, and the flames exploded into the air bringing a bright snowfall with them.</p><p>\u201cNow you\u2019re just showing off. It would have taken half the energy to created rain, even less a rain of blossoms or something similar. Or even better - you could have just drown it in ash.\u201d</p><p>The blonde stared up into her snowfall, flakes dotting her hair. \u201cBut I thought we were having fun? Snow is more fun. Rain would ruin my hair.\u201d</p><p>Greens and blues flickered through the black of her hair as she shook her head at the girl. \u201cYou will learn the value of conserving your energy, child. Even mine, with pure blood of Old Valyria, is not limitless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. A new game then. Who can outmatch the other using the least energy. \u201d Mischief flickered in Helen\u2019s blue-green eyes. The same eyes that the Blackthorn man wore with such sorrow.</p><p>The Valyrian removed her mask, allowing it to evaporate in silver wisps. \u201cVery well. But I have dealt with your kinds\u2019 games before. Do not think you can best me with simple fairy tricks, girl.\u201d</p><p>Helen smiled sweetly. \u201cI would never dream of such a thing, Mistress Quaithe.\u201d The flowering vine wrapped around her wrist loosened, dropping two metal objects to the floor. The girl bent gracefully to grab them, the larger in her left and the smaller in her right.</p><p>Quaithe cursed in Valyrian. Helen was holding a stele and a seraph blade, smirking at her master\u2019s obvious surprise.</p><p>\u201cStealing should have been made off limits.\u201d</p><p>The doors opened, admitting Jia and Andrew, who paused to take in the scene. Jia stared at the weapons Helen was holding. \u201cI must say, I agree. The Clave does frown upon stealing, although it is nice to see another Blackthorn wielding a blade.\u201d</p><p>Andrew just looked concerned. \u201cIs everything alright here?\u201d</p><p>Quiathe turned her back to Helen, facing the two shadowhunters. \u201cWe\u2019re just training. Something to pass the time.\u201d She heard the girl move before their eyes even caught the movement. She flicked her wrist and a barrier prevented Helen from passing to complete her attack. Quaithe turned to poke at the barrier right above where Helen was glaring, trapped on the other side of the room. \u201cI told you, minimal energy. You tried to lure me into hand-to-hand combat with weapons that you know can injure me. So I used your angel blood against you. I can walk through this barrier, but nothing angelic can pass.\u201d</p><p>Jia stepped up to the barrier, curious. \u201cStrange. It takes warlocks immense preparation and energy to conjure this kind of ward.\u201d</p><p>Andrew put his hand on the barrier, as solid for him as it was for his daughter. \u201cThat\u2019s because blood magic isn\u2019t natural for warlocks. Their magic is demonic in nature. Lady Quaithe is draconian. Her magic is of nature - fire and blood. That\u2019s where the saying comes from, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>She lowered her hand and the barrier evaporated into flakes of silver, drifting to the floor like Helen\u2019s snowfall had before. \u201cYou are mostly correct. It runs deeper than that, but that\u2019s an easy way to understand it.\u201d</p><p>Jia turned to face the rest of the room. \u201cIt\u2019s the Targaryen girl. A warlock contacted me about her and begged me to give her protection. I couldn\u2019t take it to the Clave because I had no way to say what she was, but it was clear she wasn\u2019t mundane - immune to heat, had the Sight, never been sick. She has no warlock mark, no magic that we can see, and she\u2019s in the care of her mad brother who wants to trade her for an army. I did what I could - I sent a shadowhunter to be her guard. But she\u2019s not what you are.\u201d</p><p>Quaithe shook her head. \u201cNone of the Targaryens ever were. Some of my kind were born as dragons, some as I am, some with the ability to shift between. But our blood runs in that girl\u2019s veins, the blood of dragons. A single shadowhunter can only protect her so long as no one knows what she is.\u201d</p><p>Blackthorn paled. \u201cWhat would happen if someone knew what she was and sought to use her blood for some kind of magic?\u201d</p><p>Silver eyes flashed. She knew what he was asking. \u201cWith the right dragon\u2019s blood and the right spell, someone could become as powerful as I am, infused with the magic of blood and fire, able to bring about the next Doom. If Valentine had successfully gotten to Rhaegar he would have brought about the end of all of us with non-angelic blood.\u201d</p><p>She could feel Helen\u2019s anger radiating, forcing her to motion. \u201cYou and your Clave only ever cared about containing your Uprising. You did nothing to stop the genocide he committed against the last of their line. An entire race - decimated! The dragons - gone! What would we do if Rhaegar really was the last? Allow that magic to slip away from the world? Do you have any idea what is-\u201d</p><p>Quaithe shushed her. The Clave didn\u2019t need to know what the flames saw. They weren\u2019t ready. \u201cYou said she had a shadowhunter with her. I assume that means you\u2019re receiving fire messages.\u201d</p><p>Jia nodded, pulling the folded, singed paper from a pocket in her leathers. Quaithe ran her hand along the edge, gathering the burned remains on her fingers. The ash whispered of grass and wind and open air. Some deep, primal part of her ached to fly.</p><p>Jia shuffled her feet, almost nervously. \u201cThe shadowhunter with the princess is my daughter, Aline. She will not trust you and will view you as a threat, even if you take her,\u201d she nodded toward Helen, \u201cwith you. Tell her to ask you the question, to which you will answer 'Only a pen.\u2019 It\u2019s a bit of a joke. But she will know I sent you.\u201d</p><p>Quaithe nodded as she made her way up the steps, still rubbing the ash between her fingers, her mind picturing the exact place she was about to portal to. She could hear Helen saying an awkward farewell to her father, promising to visit the Institute in Dorne soon, and that she would send a fire message as soon as she was able.</p><p>As soon as the fae girl was by her side, the Valyrian blew the ash into the air, letting it shimmer as she moved her hands around it until the heat in the air was so intense, the air itself seemed to solidify into black glass, streaked with green and purple veins.</p><p>Helen holstered her stolen seraph blade and drew a few runes before tucking the stele away too. It wouldn\u2019t do to greet a suspicious shadowhunter and not look like a fellow nephilim. They walked through together, hearing the shattering of the thin glass behind them as they did.</p><p>The sun was high on the plains of the Great Grass Sea, and the cacophony of a khalasar was enough to drive anyone with mundane senses mad, much less Quaithe\u2019s Valyrian senses. Instinctively, her mask was back over her face, her hair and eyes glamoured, using much of her ability to maintain and suppress her magic.</p><p>Helen glanced around them, taking in the revelries they\u2019d stepped out into. \u201cIt would appear you\u2019ve portaled us straight into a Dothraki wedding, Mistress.\u201d Their entrance appeared to have gone unnoticed, as they were behind what seemed to be an outcropping of rock, hidden from the high dais, where it would appear the newly married couple sat.</p><p>Quaithe took one look at the girl, silver hair flowing and violet eyes hiding a strength no one around seemed to see, and her own blood seemed to boil. \u201cThat\u2019s her. I can sense her fire from here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great. How about we deal with this first, not that I\u2019m complaining or anything.\u201d</p><p>She turned to see Helen with a glowing seraph blade at her throat, a young shadowhunter who could only be Aline, immobilizing her.</p><p>The Valyrian removed her glamour and veil, almost in exasperation. \u201cAsk your question, Penhallow.\u201d</p><p>Aline stiffened, the blade twitching at Helen\u2019s throat. \u201cWhat will always defeat the blade?\u201d</p><p>Quaithe laughed. Jia was right, it was a bit of a joke. She flicked an unglamoured, taloned hand toward the two nephilim, taking Helen\u2019s stele from where it was tucked into her loose robes. She held up the adamas item so Aline could see it clearly. \u201cOnly a pen.\u201d</p><hr><p>Clary was beyond a loss for what was happening in front of her. The gigantic man who had claimed to be a wolf, or skinchanger, or whatever, was staring down at Lord Bane, almost with hesitation. Magnus held out his hand and the big wildling grasped his forearm, widening his stance as if prepared for pain. </p><p>She watched the man she only knew as a librarian and minor healer wave his hands, creating an aura of power around the two of them. Her attention was torn from the scene when Isabelle hissed in pain, grabbing at her own forearm. A knowing look passed between the two Lightwood boys and Alec went to Izzy immediately, speaking too quiet for Clary to hear. </p><p>Jace stepped near to her, pulling that pen-brand thing out again and waving it loosely in his hands. \u201cBane activated our own memory runes so that we\u2019ll be able to see what he sees. I can give you the rune if you want, but I don\u2019t plan on marking you any more than you\u2019re prepared to handle. Earlier, I really just didn\u2019t plan to let you freeze.\u201d He shrugged and gave her a cocky smile, but it came off a bit more like a grimace. </p><p>She lifted her sleeve to reveal the heat rune, determination in the way she shoved her wrist at him. \u201cI told you, if it affects the safety of the family I serve, I have a right to know.\u201d</p><p>He seemed to evaluate her for a moment, looking her over with his mismatched eyes that somehow only made him more attractive. Or would, if he ever stopped acting so bloody arrogant. He took another step closer to her, holding her forearm firmly as if he expected her to jerk away. \u201cThis is going to hurt, but we don\u2019t want to give away what the warlock is doing, so don\u2019t cry out.\u201d</p><p>Clary shot him an annoyed glare. She watched after direwolves, reigned in wild ladies, and trained for an unknown battle in secret with her mother. She wasn\u2019t some soft girl who fainted at the sight of blood. \u201cGet on with it or we might miss something important.\u201d</p><p>His golden hair reflected the fire in the tent as he shook his head, chuckling. \u201cAlec and Izzy have that covered,\u201d he gestured over his shoulder where the two had taken a seat, appearing to watch the process intently. \u201cWe\u2019re just joining the party a bit late. Okay, brace yourself.\u201d</p><p>She stared past him at Magnus and the big man - Tormund. This whole thing was something that she\u2019d just accidentally wandered into and now part of it was searing into her skin, marking her as its own. Looks like you\u2019re one of us, Isabelle had said. Jace was right, this hurt worse than the other one. She focused on the memory of running into the group on the stairway, Nymeria nearly bowling Jace over, and the dumbfounded look on his face when he realized she could see him. She could see this world, could take the marks of these Shadowhunters, and maybe even share in the memories of this warlock and skinchanger. Just yesterday her biggest secret had been that she was as good a swordsman as Jon. </p><p>\u201cDone.\u201d</p><p>She glanced down at her arm, at the strange shape of the rune that could be an letter of some kind, but maybe a design of some kind? She wasn\u2019t sure, but she could feel the power it brought, feel the draw of the warlock\u2019s power. Somehow, she new what Magnus\u2019 magic felt like. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t nearly as bad as you made it seem.\u201d</p><p>He held out an arm, leading her to sit next to his siblings. \u201cYes, well, you appear to be much tougher than the average mundane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought I\u2019d made that rather clear. The strength of your skepticism is the true surprise here, Jace Wayland.\u201d Clary sat gracefully, as she\u2019d learned in the lessons with Arya and the Septa, not allowing him a chance to respond. </p><p>He huffed in annoyance as he sat next to her, leaning across her to touch the metal pen to the rune he\u2019d just marked, causing it to glow with a golden light and her mind to rush with images that were flooding from Magnus\u2019 mind as it was linked to the skinchanger\u2019s. </p><p><i>A whole group of wildlings are huddled in this space, nuzzling close together, not lighting a fire, not wanting to draw attention to their family. No, family is the wrong word - Pack. They are pack. Some are in their mundane form, some are wolf, some are in-between with claws and fur on their face, eyes glowing when they open them. Their scent is all over this hut. It is time to go before something tracks them. He tells them to move. No one is happy, least of all his girls. They liked having a place to just spend with the pack. They liked to be able to stay wolf. Out in the woods, it\u2019s not safe. He keeps his pack as mundanes. </i></p><p><i>There\u2019s a village, but no smoke, no smell of mundanes, no sound of heartbeats. Just a sense of death. The girls don\u2019t like it, they want to go around, or double back and go back to the hut. But he wants to find safety, find some kind of alliance - another pack, another clan - anything, to keep the pack safe and together. He should have listened to the girls. They always did have better sense than him. They whimpered as they followed into the village. Everything was wrong. There were bodies but none of the wolves could smell blood. It all just smelled of ice and cold. It didn\u2019t smell like death, just felt like it. His pack spread out, searching for answers, for survivors. A bite could save an injured ally, it was their way. No survivors, just the bodies, strewn in a spiral. To wolves, the spiral means revenge. Gods only know what it means to these ice demons. </i></p><p><i>As we were divided, they stood, not a sound. Not even he, as the alpha, could hear their movements. But he could hear the screams of his pack - of his girls - as they were torn apart. He found them with throats ripped out, arms and legs torn off, and was attacked by the blue-eyed dead. His change to a great red wolf was seamless and he tossed them about like rag dolls. Until their master arrived - some great creature made of nothing but ice and bone. It screeched and he turned and saw his girls get up, still bloody and torn, eyes glowing blue instead of green, and move to attack him - their father and alpha. </i></p><p><i>He roared in rage, but it was to deaf ears. They weren\u2019t his wolves anymore. The grief and pain, the agony of the loss and trauma kept him a wolf. He stalked the woods, turning a new pack, more vicious and ready to fight than the other. Until he saw the full army of the dead. He and his new pack were far north, in the everwinter, piled in a safe cave, when it all passed by underneath them. Thousands of the creatures, all ranging in size - some beyond recognition of what they once were, others in various states of decay. All led by those ice demons who spoke only in screeches. North wasn\u2019t safe. He had to get his pack south, away from these things, as far south as they could get. He wouldn\u2019t lose anymore wolves to these bastards.</i></p><p><i>He wouldn\u2019t be caught in a war where his daughters were mindless pawns in the hands of demons. It was time to find a way out.</i></p>",

She could hear Clary\u2019s friend Simon inside practicing as she banged on the solid wooden door. He stopped abruptly, and scuffling followed before the door flew open.</p><p>Nymeria all but leaped on the musician, causing him to scramble back. \u201cNym, heel.\u201d her wolf pup pulled back to sit and she watched Simon tried to retain his dignity as he straightened himself.</p><p>He took her in, brown eyes widening, and bowed immediately in respect. \u201cLady Arya. I\u2026 Why\u2026 Forgive me, m'lady, but what are you doing here? And why alone? Where\u2019s Clary?\u201d</p><p>Arya felt her rigid posture fall a little, and Nymeria reacted, baring fangs, startling the boy. So he didn\u2019t know where Clary had gone either. She pulled her shoulders back again, lifting her chin, a calming hand in her wolf\u2019s coat. Simon might be Clary\u2019s best friend, but she didn\u2019t know him and wasn\u2019t about to let him see she was panicking. \u201cI actually came to ask you about the night of the feast. You and Clary were dining with Jon, correct?\u201d</p><p>He nodded, eyeing Nym fearfully. \u201cYeah, but she kept staring at this empty table, as if she was watching someone or waiting for someone. It was weird. Even for Clary. Jon was being his usually brooding self and she just excused herself, marched up to Lord Bane, interrupting one of his stories, and he led her upstairs to the library. It was all so strange.\u201d</p><p>The wolf in Arya bristled at his failure to protect their mutual friend. \u201cAnd you didn\u2019t think it strange enough to follow? To investigate?\u201d</p><p>Simon at least had the decency to blush. He ran his hand through his messy dark hair. \u201cTo be honest, m'lady, at first, I thought it was because your brother was being rather rude, if you\u2019ll excuse me saying. Once she\u2019d left in such a odd way, I had already been called upon to play by the king.\u201d</p><p>She let her guard down a bit, causing even Nymeria to sit back and calm. She did recall that bit of the evening. The king had been quite insistent that his new minstrel demonstrate his skills for them all. Simon couldn\u2019t have followed Clary if he\u2019d wanted to. \u201cVery well. One last thing, you said she seemed like she was waiting for someone. Did she mention running into anyone from the king\u2019s party? Even in passing?\u201d</p>[[MORE]]<p>The musician shook his head. \u201cNot to me, m'lady. But I haven\u2019t seen her since they all arrived that night and the feast.\u201d Arya watched as the realization and panic filled his eyes. \u201cWait, no one\u2019s seen her, have they? Otherwise you would have just asked Luke and known where she was.\u201d He paused, \u201cM'lady.\u201d</p><p>Arya raised a brow at him and his failure at his courtesies. Sansa would have been appalled. \u201cAll anyone seems to know is she\u2019s on some kind of errand with Lord Bane and some of the king\u2019s party may or may not have gone with them.\u201d</p><p>He disappeared into his small quarters, quickly reappearing with his cloak and hunting horn. He knelt awkwardly, clearly not used to interacting with the nobles. Arya felt she might be able to like him after all. \u201cLady Arya, please let me accompany you to find Clarissa Rivers. I\u2019m not a fighter or a tracker, but I know her better than anyone.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes. \u201cOh get up. You look ridiculous.\u201d Even Nymeria was cocking her head at Simon kneeling awkwardly in his doorway to the scrawny lady. \u201cIf you\u2019re helping, we\u2019re meeting Jon in the library to see if there\u2019s anything there.\u201d</p><p>The two she-wolves turned to head back to the keep while the musician nearly tripped on his own cloak in a scramble to get to his feet and follow.</p><hr><p>Daenerys braced herself for the cold as she got out of the steaming water. Aline never shirked away from making it as hot as she liked. The shadowhunter was there, in her black leathers, weapons on display, holding out the fine gown that Dany was to wear for her wedding.</p><p>\u201cYou are certain you want to do this? We can help you if you don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Dany stared up into the dark eyes of her guard and new friend. She gingerly lifted the dress. \u201cWhatever is meant for me, it is in finding a home. I\u2019m not going to find it here. I\u2019ve been told my whole life that home is in Westeros, a place I haven\u2019t been since I was born and whisked away. You asked me what I want, and I told you the truth. I want to go home. I want to find where it is. I want to find a place that is home.\u201d</p><p>Aline nodded and began helping her into the pale dress, clasping the cuffs onto her upper arms. \u201cI will be beside you until you find your Idris, princess.\u201d</p><p>Daenerys smirked at her. \u201cAfter today, it won\u2019t be princess. It will be khaleesi.\u201d</p><p>The shadowhunter breathed out a laugh as she worked through her hair, pulling back bits into small braids. \u201cOf course, khaleesi.\u201d</p><p>Her hair done, dress donned, Dany turned to the mirror. Her brother would say \u2018it would have to do,\u2019 but she knew the dress was finer than any she\u2019d ever worn, and her hair looked lovely. \u201cYou know, nephilim, I do believe a bit of your boldness is having an effect on me.\u201d Aline only glanced at her, brow raised. \u201cSo, in return for this bride gift you have given me, I will give you this advice. Your traditional gear will not be so out of place among the Dothraki. Just lose the sleeves. All they wear is leather. Yours is just black and smoothed out.\u201d</p><p>Aline smiled and nodded as they both turned to the group of footfalls they heard approaching. The sun would rise soon and the ceremony would begin. <i>I am the blood of the dragon. A dragon is not afraid.</i></p><p>The door opened and Illyrio and her brother, followed by a group of attendants and sycophants awaited her debut. She allowed the pale gown to trail behind her, the ribbons of material attached to the cuffs on her arms, giving her the feeling of almost having wings.<i> I am the blood of the dragon. A dragon is not afraid.</i></p><p>She was escorted outside the city where the entire khalasar had gathered. Illyrio leaned over to her in the carriage. \u201cHe has forty thousand riders, nearly ten thousand of which are screamers.\u201d</p><p>Viserys grinned viciously. \u201cCan you imagine what I could do to the usurper\u2019s forces with ten thousand Dothraki screamers?\u201d</p><p>Daenerys saw the cruelty in his eyes. \u201cWin back our home, and the hearts of our people, of course.\u201d She stated it as innocently and stupidly as she could, despite seeing the rage and madness in him that everyone accused their father of. <i>I am the blood of the dragon. A dragon is not afraid.</i></p><p>She was led to a high seat next to the Khal, with the sun rising behind her, the bay behind her, and an entire khalasar spread out before her, dotting the hills nearly as far as she could see. Her brother moved to sit next to her, but was guided to a dais just below her, next to Illyrio and a Westerosi knight. Aline had taken her advice, she was in a leather vest, with leather trousers, and her weapons belt hanging for all to see. Her marks were on full display, up her arms and neck, even on her chest. A few Dothraki glanced at her curiously, but several said khaleesi, and the subject must have been dropped.</p><p>Her new husband clapped his hands and everything was put into motion at once. There was chaotic music, women dancing, food being brought before them - very little of which Dany found herself able to eat. The wedding itself was a blur of women dancing, men mounting them, fighting over them to the death, and mounting new ones.</p><p>It was all far more gruesome than she had been prepared for. She\u2019d been told there should be at least three deaths. She didn\u2019t expect full disembowelments right in front of her. Her plan had been to try and make conversation with her new husband, based on what she\u2019d been studying in all of Illyrio\u2019s books. But she found herself struck dumb by the violence the morning brought.</p><p>Noon brought the gifts. Drogo\u2019s bloodriders gifted her with the traditional weapons and she spoke the traditional refusals, giving them, instead, to her husband. The strange Westerosi knight swore his fealty to her brother and to her, and offered her a collection of books, as he had learned of her love to read and study. She thanked him and accepted his oath. Even found it in herself to accept the three girls her brother presented as a gift.<i> I am the blood of the dragon. A dragon is not afraid. </i></p><p>Illyrio, as grandiose as ever, brought forth three large chests, one filled with silks and fabrics, one with books she hadn\u2019t seen in his library, and the last with three large stones. She stepped forward, drawn to them. He smiled knowingly at her. \u201cThey\u2019re dragons\u2019 eggs, princess, turned to stone through the years.\u201d</p><p>Dany lifted one, gentle with it as if it were a babe, surprised at how warm it was. She eyed the warlock. \u201cYou could count those years, too, couldn\u2019t you, old man?\u201d He sputtered some kind of reply but she was entirely focused on the black scaled stone in her hands, laced with red veins. She ran her hand over the other two, one cream and gold, the other green and bronze, soaking in their warmth as she replaced the third.</p><p>Her eyes met the wide ones of Illyrio who looked as though he\u2019d been caught in some great scheme. She smiled. \u201cI thank you for your remarkable gifts. And I hope you will stay in contact through my attendant, Aline, while I travel to Vaes Dothrak.\u201d He bowed and retreated to his seat next to her brother.</p><p>The Khal did not speak to her as he stood, gesturing for her gift from him to be brought forward. A beautiful filly, with an ice-white mane and pale grey hair that appeared almost silver, trotted up to the dais. She was the most beautiful horse Daenerys had ever laid eyes on. Drogo lifted her onto the bare back, clearly expecting her to prove she could ride. Her eyes flicked to Aline and the shadowhunter tapped her inner thighs with the dagger she had in her hands, looking like she\u2019d been in some kind of brief skirmish with one of the bloodriders to her side. Dany understood though. She squeezed with her thighs and the silver moved forward. It was exhilarating. Rushing out into the khalasar to whoops and hollers, she allowed the filly to break into a full gallop, feeling like she could be flying, feeling free.<i> I am the blood of the dragon. I can thrive here among these people. </i></p><p>She guided her silver back up to the wedding party, leaping over the great fire to settle before the khal. Her thrill must have shown in her face. He smiled at her.</p><p>She blushed. \u201cYeri zhorre azho anna jin chaf.\u201d He smiled again, perhaps at her use of his native tongue, or at her compliment, either way, she was far less nervous about what was to happen now that the sun was setting and his own mount was being brought.</p><p>Dany searched for Aline to give her some reassurance, since this would be one place her guardian could not follow, but the shadowhunter was nowhere to be seen. All the better, she would not be worrying about Dany and her wedding night.</p><p>Drogo set off at a fast pace and Dany and her silver were actually pleased to follow.<i> I am the blood of the dragon and I am not afraid.</i></p><hr><p>\u201cHow many bloody places can there be for a dwarf to hide in a keep?\u201d Jon swore he\u2019d searched every crevice of Winterfell. Lord Tyrion Lannister was no where to be found. In fact, none of the Lannisters were around. The king had taken much of the guards and other men out for a hunt in the wolfswood, but Jaime Lannister had declined. It was all the serving girls were talking about - mooning over his golden head and whether or not they might run into him at some point.</p><p>Finally, he made his way down to the kitchens, ready to ask one of Arya\u2019s friends - a boy who worked with the baker, when he saw the dwarf sitting at a small table in the corner meant for staff, happily drinking as all the serving staff ignored him nervously.</p><p>He caught sight of Jon and waved him over to the small table, obviously drunk. \u201cAh! Jon, come join me! Did you know, your father does not let a single whore into this entire keep? None! In all of Winterfell! I\u2019d have to go to one of the towns outside the keep to find a girl.\u201d</p><p>Jon blanched at the subject. \u201cHow terrible it must be for you, my lord. Now if you wouldn\u2019t mind. I\u2019d like to ask you about the three you saw my friend Clary leave with the other night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you mean the lovely red head. A little young for my liking, but she\u2019s certainly beautiful.\u201d Tyrion hiccuped. \u201cThe <i>other </i>one, though. Dark hair, dark eyes, all those tattoos, dressed like she was ready for battle. Now she was a sight.\u201d</p><p>That sounded like the kind of woman Jon would remember, drunk or not. \u201cBut not too young for you, huh?\u201d He tried to make his tone sound teasing, not prying.</p><p>\u201cCertainly still young, but a woman for certain. I might have even been so bold to talk to her if her brother hadn\u2019t been there, watching Lord Bane like he was ready to murder. Or that golden boy. That one looked like he and Jaime could be long lost brothers.\u201d Tyrion spit the last bit out with venom.</p><p>Jon had their descriptions. But not why no one else saw them. \u201cTyrion, why did no one else see them?\u201d</p><p>Lannister just shrugged, slurring his words. \u201cThat\u2019s the way things have always been. I can see things I\u2019m not supposed to. Ever since I was a child. Everyone just said I was playing pretend, then I learned to just not say anything at all. Except that woman. She rode in the carriage with Myrcella. So she\u2019s not always invisible to everyone. I don\u2019t know. Lightwood, I think was the name. Yeah. That\u2019s the name Cercei kept spitting over and over. Something about 'how dare Lady Maryse presume to use her influence in such a way\u2019 or some other self-righteous tantrum.\u201d</p><p>He was starting to piece things together. Slowly, maybe. Some of Old Nan\u2019s stories talked about warriors of the old gods who marked themselves to gain power of the gods, who were more than human, but the First Men were gifted by the Children of the Forest with the ability to see them. It was called the Sight. Maybe some legends were true.</p><p>\u201cSo these Lightwoods, can be visible when they want to, you have the Sight - so you can see them either way, and they used their influence to join your group north, to speak to Lord Bane, somehow Clary is involved, and now they\u2019ve all disappeared.\u201d Jon pressed his palms to his forehead. Deduction was not his area of expertise.</p><p>Tyrion suddenly spoke clearly. \u201cSee I\u2019d gotten that far on my own, thank you. In fact, I\u2019d realized Clary had nothing to do with the Lightwood siblings until they got here, purely based on her father\u2019s reaction to the name. But he certainly knows something about the family. His eyes glowed green at the mere mention of it.\u201d</p><p>Jon\u2019s head shot up. \u201cWhat? I didn\u2019t see that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have the Sight, you don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell it hardly matters right now, anyway. We can\u2019t ask Luke anything while he\u2019s out hunting with Lord Stark and the king.\u201d Jon rested his head back on his palms, elbows propped on the table.</p><p>Tyrion took another long drink of his wine, setting the empty cup down loudly. \u201cDoesn\u2019t matter. They weren\u2019t here for your pretty little redhead. They were here for Bane. What\u2019s so special about your failed maester-turned-apothecary? Other than he weaves better tales than even I do, of course.\u201d</p><p>Lord Bane was eccentric, for sure, but Jon had never noticed anything out of the ordinary for someone who experimented in science and medicine. \u201cNothing that I can tell. He\u2019s been here as long as any of us can remember, is extravagant in his tastes, and expensive in his practice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long has he been here?\u201d Tyrion frowned.</p><p>\u201cSince Robert\u2019s Rebellion, I think. He moved north about the same time Clary\u2019s family did.\u201d</p><p>Tyrion shook his head. \u201cThat man doesn\u2019t look old enough to have been around since Robert\u2019s Rebellion.\u201d</p><p>Now that he mentioned it, Bane did appear young, perhaps only one-and-twenty. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s some of the medicines and potions he\u2019s using?\u201d</p><p>Lannister stood, his legs appearing stiff as Jon watched him wince. \u201cI suppose the only way to know is to check his library and see what sort of strange things he keeps there.\u201d</p><p>Jon ran a hand through his hair. \u201cHow convenient, I\u2019m meeting Arya there to search shortly.\u201d</p><p>The dwarf of Lannister grinned up at him. \u201cGood. Bring your wolf.\u201d</p><hr><p>Helen was pacing. The Volantis Institute, with its solid walls and few windows, was ill-suited to her fae nature. Quaithe watched as the girl took out her agitation on the path she was wearing into the floor. They could leave anytime they wanted, of course, and the Shadowhunters knew it, but they needed answers, and Jia seemed to know where the new dragon was.</p><p>\u201cWe could always occupy ourselves. Cause a little havoc, get their attention?\u201d Quaithe\u2019s smooth voice halted Helen\u2019s trek around the room for the thousandth time.</p><p>She grinned a true fae grin. \u201cWhat did you have in mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh nothing too devastating, just some simple training like we used to when you were younger. I\u2019ll attack with my destructive magic, you negate it with your natural magic. Should be fun, considering how much you\u2019ve grown in your skills.\u201d Quaithe tilted her head, lacquered veil shifting with her, revealing only her bright silver eyes.</p><p>Helen plucked one of the flowers from her hair, allowing it to grow and weave its way around her arm, twisting into a bracer. Quaithe stood, shifting the table and chairs out of their way with a wave of her hand. She flicked her hand toward the fae girl, black flames surrounding her, low and smoldering.</p><p>A cool breeze blew in, like fresh snow, and the flames exploded into the air bringing a bright snowfall with them.</p><p>\u201cNow you\u2019re just showing off. It would have taken half the energy to created rain, even less a rain of blossoms or something similar. Or even better - you could have just drown it in ash.\u201d</p><p>The blonde stared up into her snowfall, flakes dotting her hair. \u201cBut I thought we were having fun? Snow is more fun. Rain would ruin my hair.\u201d</p><p>Greens and blues flickered through the black of her hair as she shook her head at the girl. \u201cYou will learn the value of conserving your energy, child. Even mine, with pure blood of Old Valyria, is not limitless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. A new game then. Who can outmatch the other using the least energy. \u201d Mischief flickered in Helen\u2019s blue-green eyes. The same eyes that the Blackthorn man wore with such sorrow.</p><p>The Valyrian removed her mask, allowing it to evaporate in silver wisps. \u201cVery well. But I have dealt with your kinds\u2019 games before. Do not think you can best me with simple fairy tricks, girl.\u201d</p><p>Helen smiled sweetly. \u201cI would never dream of such a thing, Mistress Quaithe.\u201d The flowering vine wrapped around her wrist loosened, dropping two metal objects to the floor. The girl bent gracefully to grab them, the larger in her left and the smaller in her right.</p><p>Quaithe cursed in Valyrian. Helen was holding a stele and a seraph blade, smirking at her master\u2019s obvious surprise.</p><p>\u201cStealing should have been made off limits.\u201d</p><p>The doors opened, admitting Jia and Andrew, who paused to take in the scene. Jia stared at the weapons Helen was holding. \u201cI must say, I agree. The Clave does frown upon stealing, although it is nice to see another Blackthorn wielding a blade.\u201d</p><p>Andrew just looked concerned. \u201cIs everything alright here?\u201d</p><p>Quiathe turned her back to Helen, facing the two shadowhunters. \u201cWe\u2019re just training. Something to pass the time.\u201d She heard the girl move before their eyes even caught the movement. She flicked her wrist and a barrier prevented Helen from passing to complete her attack. Quaithe turned to poke at the barrier right above where Helen was glaring, trapped on the other side of the room. \u201cI told you, minimal energy. You tried to lure me into hand-to-hand combat with weapons that you know can injure me. So I used your angel blood against you. I can walk through this barrier, but nothing angelic can pass.\u201d</p><p>Jia stepped up to the barrier, curious. \u201cStrange. It takes warlocks immense preparation and energy to conjure this kind of ward.\u201d</p><p>Andrew put his hand on the barrier, as solid for him as it was for his daughter. \u201cThat\u2019s because blood magic isn\u2019t natural for warlocks. Their magic is demonic in nature. Lady Quaithe is draconian. Her magic is of nature - fire and blood. That\u2019s where the saying comes from, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>She lowered her hand and the barrier evaporated into flakes of silver, drifting to the floor like Helen\u2019s snowfall had before. \u201cYou are mostly correct. It runs deeper than that, but that\u2019s an easy way to understand it.\u201d</p><p>Jia turned to face the rest of the room. \u201cIt\u2019s the Targaryen girl. A warlock contacted me about her and begged me to give her protection. I couldn\u2019t take it to the Clave because I had no way to say what she was, but it was clear she wasn\u2019t mundane - immune to heat, had the Sight, never been sick. She has no warlock mark, no magic that we can see, and she\u2019s in the care of her mad brother who wants to trade her for an army. I did what I could - I sent a shadowhunter to be her guard. But she\u2019s not what you are.\u201d</p><p>Quaithe shook her head. \u201cNone of the Targaryens ever were. Some of my kind were born as dragons, some as I am, some with the ability to shift between. But our blood runs in that girl\u2019s veins, the blood of dragons. A single shadowhunter can only protect her so long as no one knows what she is.\u201d</p><p>Blackthorn paled. \u201cWhat would happen if someone knew what she was and sought to use her blood for some kind of magic?\u201d</p><p>Silver eyes flashed. She knew what he was asking. \u201cWith the right dragon\u2019s blood and the right spell, someone could become as powerful as I am, infused with the magic of blood and fire, able to bring about the next Doom. If Valentine had successfully gotten to Rhaegar he would have brought about the end of all of us with non-angelic blood.\u201d</p><p>She could feel Helen\u2019s anger radiating, forcing her to motion. \u201cYou and your Clave only ever cared about containing your Uprising. You did nothing to stop the genocide he committed against the last of their line. An entire race - decimated! The dragons - gone! What would we do if Rhaegar really was the last? Allow that magic to slip away from the world? Do you have any idea what is-\u201d</p><p>Quaithe shushed her. The Clave didn\u2019t need to know what the flames saw. They weren\u2019t ready. \u201cYou said she had a shadowhunter with her. I assume that means you\u2019re receiving fire messages.\u201d</p><p>Jia nodded, pulling the folded, singed paper from a pocket in her leathers. Quaithe ran her hand along the edge, gathering the burned remains on her fingers. The ash whispered of grass and wind and open air. Some deep, primal part of her ached to fly.</p><p>Jia shuffled her feet, almost nervously. \u201cThe shadowhunter with the princess is my daughter, Aline. She will not trust you and will view you as a threat, even if you take her,\u201d she nodded toward Helen, \u201cwith you. Tell her to ask you the question, to which you will answer 'Only a pen.\u2019 It\u2019s a bit of a joke. But she will know I sent you.\u201d</p><p>Quaithe nodded as she made her way up the steps, still rubbing the ash between her fingers, her mind picturing the exact place she was about to portal to. She could hear Helen saying an awkward farewell to her father, promising to visit the Institute in Dorne soon, and that she would send a fire message as soon as she was able.</p><p>As soon as the fae girl was by her side, the Valyrian blew the ash into the air, letting it shimmer as she moved her hands around it until the heat in the air was so intense, the air itself seemed to solidify into black glass, streaked with green and purple veins.</p><p>Helen holstered her stolen seraph blade and drew a few runes before tucking the stele away too. It wouldn\u2019t do to greet a suspicious shadowhunter and not look like a fellow nephilim. They walked through together, hearing the shattering of the thin glass behind them as they did.</p><p>The sun was high on the plains of the Great Grass Sea, and the cacophony of a khalasar was enough to drive anyone with mundane senses mad, much less Quaithe\u2019s Valyrian senses. Instinctively, her mask was back over her face, her hair and eyes glamoured, using much of her ability to maintain and suppress her magic.</p><p>Helen glanced around them, taking in the revelries they\u2019d stepped out into. \u201cIt would appear you\u2019ve portaled us straight into a Dothraki wedding, Mistress.\u201d Their entrance appeared to have gone unnoticed, as they were behind what seemed to be an outcropping of rock, hidden from the high dais, where it would appear the newly married couple sat.</p><p>Quaithe took one look at the girl, silver hair flowing and violet eyes hiding a strength no one around seemed to see, and her own blood seemed to boil. \u201cThat\u2019s her. I can sense her fire from here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great. How about we deal with this first, not that I\u2019m complaining or anything.\u201d</p><p>She turned to see Helen with a glowing seraph blade at her throat, a young shadowhunter who could only be Aline, immobilizing her.</p><p>The Valyrian removed her glamour and veil, almost in exasperation. \u201cAsk your question, Penhallow.\u201d</p><p>Aline stiffened, the blade twitching at Helen\u2019s throat. \u201cWhat will always defeat the blade?\u201d</p><p>Quaithe laughed. Jia was right, it was a bit of a joke. She flicked an unglamoured, taloned hand toward the two nephilim, taking Helen\u2019s stele from where it was tucked into her loose robes. She held up the adamas item so Aline could see it clearly. \u201cOnly a pen.\u201d</p><hr><p>Clary was beyond a loss for what was happening in front of her. The gigantic man who had claimed to be a wolf, or skinchanger, or whatever, was staring down at Lord Bane, almost with hesitation. Magnus held out his hand and the big wildling grasped his forearm, widening his stance as if prepared for pain. </p><p>She watched the man she only knew as a librarian and minor healer wave his hands, creating an aura of power around the two of them. Her attention was torn from the scene when Isabelle hissed in pain, grabbing at her own forearm. A knowing look passed between the two Lightwood boys and Alec went to Izzy immediately, speaking too quiet for Clary to hear. </p><p>Jace stepped near to her, pulling that pen-brand thing out again and waving it loosely in his hands. \u201cBane activated our own memory runes so that we\u2019ll be able to see what he sees. I can give you the rune if you want, but I don\u2019t plan on marking you any more than you\u2019re prepared to handle. Earlier, I really just didn\u2019t plan to let you freeze.\u201d He shrugged and gave her a cocky smile, but it came off a bit more like a grimace. </p><p>She lifted her sleeve to reveal the heat rune, determination in the way she shoved her wrist at him. \u201cI told you, if it affects the safety of the family I serve, I have a right to know.\u201d</p><p>He seemed to evaluate her for a moment, looking her over with his mismatched eyes that somehow only made him more attractive. Or would, if he ever stopped acting so bloody arrogant. He took another step closer to her, holding her forearm firmly as if he expected her to jerk away. \u201cThis is going to hurt, but we don\u2019t want to give away what the warlock is doing, so don\u2019t cry out.\u201d</p><p>Clary shot him an annoyed glare. She watched after direwolves, reigned in wild ladies, and trained for an unknown battle in secret with her mother. She wasn\u2019t some soft girl who fainted at the sight of blood. \u201cGet on with it or we might miss something important.\u201d</p><p>His golden hair reflected the fire in the tent as he shook his head, chuckling. \u201cAlec and Izzy have that covered,\u201d he gestured over his shoulder where the two had taken a seat, appearing to watch the process intently. \u201cWe\u2019re just joining the party a bit late. Okay, brace yourself.\u201d</p><p>She stared past him at Magnus and the big man - Tormund. This whole thing was something that she\u2019d just accidentally wandered into and now part of it was searing into her skin, marking her as its own. Looks like you\u2019re one of us, Isabelle had said. Jace was right, this hurt worse than the other one. She focused on the memory of running into the group on the stairway, Nymeria nearly bowling Jace over, and the dumbfounded look on his face when he realized she could see him. She could see this world, could take the marks of these Shadowhunters, and maybe even share in the memories of this warlock and skinchanger. Just yesterday her biggest secret had been that she was as good a swordsman as Jon. </p><p>\u201cDone.\u201d</p><p>She glanced down at her arm, at the strange shape of the rune that could be an letter of some kind, but maybe a design of some kind? She wasn\u2019t sure, but she could feel the power it brought, feel the draw of the warlock\u2019s power. Somehow, she new what Magnus\u2019 magic felt like. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t nearly as bad as you made it seem.\u201d</p><p>He held out an arm, leading her to sit next to his siblings. \u201cYes, well, you appear to be much tougher than the average mundane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought I\u2019d made that rather clear. The strength of your skepticism is the true surprise here, Jace Wayland.\u201d Clary sat gracefully, as she\u2019d learned in the lessons with Arya and the Septa, not allowing him a chance to respond. </p><p>He huffed in annoyance as he sat next to her, leaning across her to touch the metal pen to the rune he\u2019d just marked, causing it to glow with a golden light and her mind to rush with images that were flooding from Magnus\u2019 mind as it was linked to the skinchanger\u2019s. </p><p><i>A whole group of wildlings are huddled in this space, nuzzling close together, not lighting a fire, not wanting to draw attention to their family. No, family is the wrong word - Pack. They are pack. Some are in their mundane form, some are wolf, some are in-between with claws and fur on their face, eyes glowing when they open them. Their scent is all over this hut. It is time to go before something tracks them. He tells them to move. No one is happy, least of all his girls. They liked having a place to just spend with the pack. They liked to be able to stay wolf. Out in the woods, it\u2019s not safe. He keeps his pack as mundanes. </i></p><p><i>There\u2019s a village, but no smoke, no smell of mundanes, no sound of heartbeats. Just a sense of death. The girls don\u2019t like it, they want to go around, or double back and go back to the hut. But he wants to find safety, find some kind of alliance - another pack, another clan - anything, to keep the pack safe and together. He should have listened to the girls. They always did have better sense than him. They whimpered as they followed into the village. Everything was wrong. There were bodies but none of the wolves could smell blood. It all just smelled of ice and cold. It didn\u2019t smell like death, just felt like it. His pack spread out, searching for answers, for survivors. A bite could save an injured ally, it was their way. No survivors, just the bodies, strewn in a spiral. To wolves, the spiral means revenge. Gods only know what it means to these ice demons. </i></p><p><i>As we were divided, they stood, not a sound. Not even he, as the alpha, could hear their movements. But he could hear the screams of his pack - of his girls - as they were torn apart. He found them with throats ripped out, arms and legs torn off, and was attacked by the blue-eyed dead. His change to a great red wolf was seamless and he tossed them about like rag dolls. Until their master arrived - some great creature made of nothing but ice and bone. It screeched and he turned and saw his girls get up, still bloody and torn, eyes glowing blue instead of green, and move to attack him - their father and alpha. </i></p><p><i>He roared in rage, but it was to deaf ears. They weren\u2019t his wolves anymore. The grief and pain, the agony of the loss and trauma kept him a wolf. He stalked the woods, turning a new pack, more vicious and ready to fight than the other. Until he saw the full army of the dead. He and his new pack were far north, in the everwinter, piled in a safe cave, when it all passed by underneath them. Thousands of the creatures, all ranging in size - some beyond recognition of what they once were, others in various states of decay. All led by those ice demons who spoke only in screeches. North wasn\u2019t safe. He had to get his pack south, away from these things, as far south as they could get. He wouldn\u2019t lose anymore wolves to these bastards.</i></p><p><i>He wouldn\u2019t be caught in a war where his daughters were mindless pawns in the hands of demons. It was time to find a way out.</i></p>",
                "content": "<p><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/15241917/chapters/35352096\">Read on ao3</a></p><p>Arya ran up the steps to one of the of the small common homes along the keep&rsquo;s wall. She could hear Clary&rsquo;s friend Simon inside practicing as she banged on the solid wooden door. He stopped abruptly, and scuffling followed before the door flew open.</p><p>Nymeria all but leaped on the musician, causing him to scramble back. &ldquo;Nym, heel.&rdquo; her wolf pup pulled back to sit and she watched Simon tried to retain his dignity as he straightened himself.</p><p>He took her in, brown eyes widening, and bowed immediately in respect. &ldquo;Lady Arya. I&hellip; Why&hellip; Forgive me, m'lady, but what are you doing here? And why alone? Where&rsquo;s Clary?&rdquo;</p><p>Arya felt her rigid posture fall a little, and Nymeria reacted, baring fangs, startling the boy. So he didn&rsquo;t know where Clary had gone either. She pulled her shoulders back again, lifting her chin, a calming hand in her wolf&rsquo;s coat. Simon might be Clary&rsquo;s best friend, but she didn&rsquo;t know him and wasn&rsquo;t about to let him see she was panicking. &ldquo;I actually came to ask you about the night of the feast. You and Clary were dining with Jon, correct?&rdquo;</p><p>He nodded, eyeing Nym fearfully. &ldquo;Yeah, but she kept staring at this empty table, as if she was watching someone or waiting for someone. It was weird. Even for Clary. Jon was being his usually brooding self and she just excused herself, marched up to Lord Bane, interrupting one of his stories, and he led her upstairs to the library. It was all so strange.&rdquo;</p><p>The wolf in Arya bristled at his failure to protect their mutual friend. &ldquo;And you didn&rsquo;t think it strange enough to follow? To investigate?&rdquo;</p><p>Simon at least had the decency to blush. He ran his hand through his messy dark hair. &ldquo;To be honest, m'lady, at first, I thought it was because your brother was being rather rude, if you&rsquo;ll excuse me saying. Once she&rsquo;d left in such a odd way, I had already been called upon to play by the king.&rdquo;</p><p>She let her guard down a bit, causing even Nymeria to sit back and calm. She did recall that bit of the evening. The king had been quite insistent that his new minstrel demonstrate his skills for them all. Simon couldn&rsquo;t have followed Clary if he&rsquo;d wanted to. &ldquo;Very well. One last thing, you said she seemed like she was waiting for someone. Did she mention running into anyone from the king&rsquo;s party? Even in passing?&rdquo;</p><p>The musician shook his head. &ldquo;Not to me, m'lady. But I haven&rsquo;t seen her since they all arrived that night and the feast.&rdquo; Arya watched as the realization and panic filled his eyes. &ldquo;Wait, no one&rsquo;s seen her, have they? Otherwise you would have just asked Luke and known where she was.&rdquo; He paused, &ldquo;M'lady.&rdquo;</p><p>Arya raised a brow at him and his failure at his courtesies. Sansa would have been appalled. &ldquo;All anyone seems to know is she&rsquo;s on some kind of errand with Lord Bane and some of the king&rsquo;s party may or may not have gone with them.&rdquo;</p><p>He disappeared into his small quarters, quickly reappearing with his cloak and hunting horn. He knelt awkwardly, clearly not used to interacting with the nobles. Arya felt she might be able to like him after all. &ldquo;Lady Arya, please let me accompany you to find Clarissa Rivers. I&rsquo;m not a fighter or a tracker, but I know her better than anyone.&rdquo;</p><p>She rolled her eyes. &ldquo;Oh get up. You look ridiculous.&rdquo; Even Nymeria was cocking her head at Simon kneeling awkwardly in his doorway to the scrawny lady. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re helping, we&rsquo;re meeting Jon in the library to see if there&rsquo;s anything there.&rdquo;</p><p>The two she-wolves turned to head back to the keep while the musician nearly tripped on his own cloak in a scramble to get to his feet and follow.</p><hr /><p>Daenerys braced herself for the cold as she got out of the steaming water. Aline never shirked away from making it as hot as she liked. The shadowhunter was there, in her black leathers, weapons on display, holding out the fine gown that Dany was to wear for her wedding.</p><p>&ldquo;You are certain you want to do this? We can help you if you don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p><p>Dany stared up into the dark eyes of her guard and new friend. She gingerly lifted the dress. &ldquo;Whatever is meant for me, it is in finding a home. I&rsquo;m not going to find it here. I&rsquo;ve been told my whole life that home is in Westeros, a place I haven&rsquo;t been since I was born and whisked away. You asked me what I want, and I told you the truth. I want to go home. I want to find where it is. I want to find a place that is home.&rdquo;</p><p>Aline nodded and began helping her into the pale dress, clasping the cuffs onto her upper arms. &ldquo;I will be beside you until you find your Idris, princess.&rdquo;</p><p>Daenerys smirked at her. &ldquo;After today, it won&rsquo;t be princess. It will be khaleesi.&rdquo;</p><p>The shadowhunter breathed out a laugh as she worked through her hair, pulling back bits into small braids. &ldquo;Of course, khaleesi.&rdquo;</p><p>Her hair done, dress donned, Dany turned to the mirror. Her brother would say &lsquo;it would have to do,&rsquo; but she knew the dress was finer than any she&rsquo;d ever worn, and her hair looked lovely. &ldquo;You know, nephilim, I do believe a bit of your boldness is having an effect on me.&rdquo; Aline only glanced at her, brow raised. &ldquo;So, in return for this bride gift you have given me, I will give you this advice. Your traditional gear will not be so out of place among the Dothraki. Just lose the sleeves. All they wear is leather. Yours is just black and smoothed out.&rdquo;</p><p>Aline smiled and nodded as they both turned to the group of footfalls they heard approaching. The sun would rise soon and the ceremony would begin. <i>I am the blood of the dragon. A dragon is not afraid.</i></p><p>The door opened and Illyrio and her brother, followed by a group of attendants and sycophants awaited her debut. She allowed the pale gown to trail behind her, the ribbons of material attached to the cuffs on her arms, giving her the feeling of almost having wings.<i> I am the blood of the dragon. A dragon is not afraid.</i></p><p>She was escorted outside the city where the entire khalasar had gathered. Illyrio leaned over to her in the carriage. &ldquo;He has forty thousand riders, nearly ten thousand of which are screamers.&rdquo;</p><p>Viserys grinned viciously. &ldquo;Can you imagine what I could do to the usurper&rsquo;s forces with ten thousand Dothraki screamers?&rdquo;</p><p>Daenerys saw the cruelty in his eyes. &ldquo;Win back our home, and the hearts of our people, of course.&rdquo; She stated it as innocently and stupidly as she could, despite seeing the rage and madness in him that everyone accused their father of. <i>I am the blood of the dragon. A dragon is not afraid.</i></p><p>She was led to a high seat next to the Khal, with the sun rising behind her, the bay behind her, and an entire khalasar spread out before her, dotting the hills nearly as far as she could see. Her brother moved to sit next to her, but was guided to a dais just below her, next to Illyrio and a Westerosi knight. Aline had taken her advice, she was in a leather vest, with leather trousers, and her weapons belt hanging for all to see. Her marks were on full display, up her arms and neck, even on her chest. A few Dothraki glanced at her curiously, but several said khaleesi, and the subject must have been dropped.</p><p>Her new husband clapped his hands and everything was put into motion at once. There was chaotic music, women dancing, food being brought before them - very little of which Dany found herself able to eat. The wedding itself was a blur of women dancing, men mounting them, fighting over them to the death, and mounting new ones.</p><p>It was all far more gruesome than she had been prepared for. She&rsquo;d been told there should be at least three deaths. She didn&rsquo;t expect full disembowelments right in front of her. Her plan had been to try and make conversation with her new husband, based on what she&rsquo;d been studying in all of Illyrio&rsquo;s books. But she found herself struck dumb by the violence the morning brought.</p><p>Noon brought the gifts. Drogo&rsquo;s bloodriders gifted her with the traditional weapons and she spoke the traditional refusals, giving them, instead, to her husband. The strange Westerosi knight swore his fealty to her brother and to her, and offered her a collection of books, as he had learned of her love to read and study. She thanked him and accepted his oath. Even found it in herself to accept the three girls her brother presented as a gift.<i> I am the blood of the dragon. A dragon is not afraid. </i></p><p>Illyrio, as grandiose as ever, brought forth three large chests, one filled with silks and fabrics, one with books she hadn&rsquo;t seen in his library, and the last with three large stones. She stepped forward, drawn to them. He smiled knowingly at her. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re dragons&rsquo; eggs, princess, turned to stone through the years.&rdquo;</p><p>Dany lifted one, gentle with it as if it were a babe, surprised at how warm it was. She eyed the warlock. &ldquo;You could count those years, too, couldn&rsquo;t you, old man?&rdquo; He sputtered some kind of reply but she was entirely focused on the black scaled stone in her hands, laced with red veins. She ran her hand over the other two, one cream and gold, the other green and bronze, soaking in their warmth as she replaced the third.</p><p>Her eyes met the wide ones of Illyrio who looked as though he&rsquo;d been caught in some great scheme. She smiled. &ldquo;I thank you for your remarkable gifts. And I hope you will stay in contact through my attendant, Aline, while I travel to Vaes Dothrak.&rdquo; He bowed and retreated to his seat next to her brother.</p><p>The Khal did not speak to her as he stood, gesturing for her gift from him to be brought forward. A beautiful filly, with an ice-white mane and pale grey hair that appeared almost silver, trotted up to the dais. She was the most beautiful horse Daenerys had ever laid eyes on. Drogo lifted her onto the bare back, clearly expecting her to prove she could ride. Her eyes flicked to Aline and the shadowhunter tapped her inner thighs with the dagger she had in her hands, looking like she&rsquo;d been in some kind of brief skirmish with one of the bloodriders to her side. Dany understood though. She squeezed with her thighs and the silver moved forward. It was exhilarating. Rushing out into the khalasar to whoops and hollers, she allowed the filly to break into a full gallop, feeling like she could be flying, feeling free.<i> I am the blood of the dragon. I can thrive here among these people. </i></p><p>She guided her silver back up to the wedding party, leaping over the great fire to settle before the khal. Her thrill must have shown in her face. He smiled at her.</p><p>She blushed. &ldquo;Yeri zhorre azho anna jin chaf.&rdquo; He smiled again, perhaps at her use of his native tongue, or at her compliment, either way, she was far less nervous about what was to happen now that the sun was setting and his own mount was being brought.</p><p>Dany searched for Aline to give her some reassurance, since this would be one place her guardian could not follow, but the shadowhunter was nowhere to be seen. All the better, she would not be worrying about Dany and her wedding night.</p><p>Drogo set off at a fast pace and Dany and her silver were actually pleased to follow.<i> I am the blood of the dragon and I am not afraid.</i></p><hr /><p>&ldquo;How many bloody places can there be for a dwarf to hide in a keep?&rdquo; Jon swore he&rsquo;d searched every crevice of Winterfell. Lord Tyrion Lannister was no where to be found. In fact, none of the Lannisters were around. The king had taken much of the guards and other men out for a hunt in the wolfswood, but Jaime Lannister had declined. It was all the serving girls were talking about - mooning over his golden head and whether or not they might run into him at some point.</p><p>Finally, he made his way down to the kitchens, ready to ask one of Arya&rsquo;s friends - a boy who worked with the baker, when he saw the dwarf sitting at a small table in the corner meant for staff, happily drinking as all the serving staff ignored him nervously.</p><p>He caught sight of Jon and waved him over to the small table, obviously drunk. &ldquo;Ah! Jon, come join me! Did you know, your father does not let a single whore into this entire keep? None! In all of Winterfell! I&rsquo;d have to go to one of the towns outside the keep to find a girl.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon blanched at the subject. &ldquo;How terrible it must be for you, my lord. Now if you wouldn&rsquo;t mind. I&rsquo;d like to ask you about the three you saw my friend Clary leave with the other night.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, you mean the lovely red head. A little young for my liking, but she&rsquo;s certainly beautiful.&rdquo; Tyrion hiccuped. &ldquo;The <i>other </i>one, though. Dark hair, dark eyes, all those tattoos, dressed like she was ready for battle. Now she was a sight.&rdquo;</p><p>That sounded like the kind of woman Jon would remember, drunk or not. &ldquo;But not too young for you, huh?&rdquo; He tried to make his tone sound teasing, not prying.</p><p>&ldquo;Certainly still young, but a woman for certain. I might have even been so bold to talk to her if her brother hadn&rsquo;t been there, watching Lord Bane like he was ready to murder. Or that golden boy. That one looked like he and Jaime could be long lost brothers.&rdquo; Tyrion spit the last bit out with venom.</p><p>Jon had their descriptions. But not why no one else saw them. &ldquo;Tyrion, why did no one else see them?&rdquo;</p><p>Lannister just shrugged, slurring his words. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way things have always been. I can see things I&rsquo;m not supposed to. Ever since I was a child. Everyone just said I was playing pretend, then I learned to just not say anything at all. Except that woman. She rode in the carriage with Myrcella. So she&rsquo;s not always invisible to everyone. I don&rsquo;t know. Lightwood, I think was the name. Yeah. That&rsquo;s the name Cercei kept spitting over and over. Something about 'how dare Lady Maryse presume to use her influence in such a way&rsquo; or some other self-righteous tantrum.&rdquo;</p><p>He was starting to piece things together. Slowly, maybe. Some of Old Nan&rsquo;s stories talked about warriors of the old gods who marked themselves to gain power of the gods, who were more than human, but the First Men were gifted by the Children of the Forest with the ability to see them. It was called the Sight. Maybe some legends were true.</p><p>&ldquo;So these Lightwoods, can be visible when they want to, you have the Sight - so you can see them either way, and they used their influence to join your group north, to speak to Lord Bane, somehow Clary is involved, and now they&rsquo;ve all disappeared.&rdquo; Jon pressed his palms to his forehead. Deduction was not his area of expertise.</p><p>Tyrion suddenly spoke clearly. &ldquo;See I&rsquo;d gotten that far on my own, thank you. In fact, I&rsquo;d realized Clary had nothing to do with the Lightwood siblings until they got here, purely based on her father&rsquo;s reaction to the name. But he certainly knows something about the family. His eyes glowed green at the mere mention of it.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon&rsquo;s head shot up. &ldquo;What? I didn&rsquo;t see that!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I have the Sight, you don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well it hardly matters right now, anyway. We can&rsquo;t ask Luke anything while he&rsquo;s out hunting with Lord Stark and the king.&rdquo; Jon rested his head back on his palms, elbows propped on the table.</p><p>Tyrion took another long drink of his wine, setting the empty cup down loudly. &ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t matter. They weren&rsquo;t here for your pretty little redhead. They were here for Bane. What&rsquo;s so special about your failed maester-turned-apothecary? Other than he weaves better tales than even I do, of course.&rdquo;</p><p>Lord Bane was eccentric, for sure, but Jon had never noticed anything out of the ordinary for someone who experimented in science and medicine. &ldquo;Nothing that I can tell. He&rsquo;s been here as long as any of us can remember, is extravagant in his tastes, and expensive in his practice.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How long has he been here?&rdquo; Tyrion frowned.</p><p>&ldquo;Since Robert&rsquo;s Rebellion, I think. He moved north about the same time Clary&rsquo;s family did.&rdquo;</p><p>Tyrion shook his head. &ldquo;That man doesn&rsquo;t look old enough to have been around since Robert&rsquo;s Rebellion.&rdquo;</p><p>Now that he mentioned it, Bane did appear young, perhaps only one-and-twenty. &ldquo;Maybe it&rsquo;s some of the medicines and potions he&rsquo;s using?&rdquo;</p><p>Lannister stood, his legs appearing stiff as Jon watched him wince. &ldquo;I suppose the only way to know is to check his library and see what sort of strange things he keeps there.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon ran a hand through his hair. &ldquo;How convenient, I&rsquo;m meeting Arya there to search shortly.&rdquo;</p><p>The dwarf of Lannister grinned up at him. &ldquo;Good. Bring your wolf.&rdquo;</p><hr /><p>Helen was pacing. The Volantis Institute, with its solid walls and few windows, was ill-suited to her fae nature. Quaithe watched as the girl took out her agitation on the path she was wearing into the floor. They could leave anytime they wanted, of course, and the Shadowhunters knew it, but they needed answers, and Jia seemed to know where the new dragon was.</p><p>&ldquo;We could always occupy ourselves. Cause a little havoc, get their attention?&rdquo; Quaithe&rsquo;s smooth voice halted Helen&rsquo;s trek around the room for the thousandth time.</p><p>She grinned a true fae grin. &ldquo;What did you have in mind?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh nothing too devastating, just some simple training like we used to when you were younger. I&rsquo;ll attack with my destructive magic, you negate it with your natural magic. Should be fun, considering how much you&rsquo;ve grown in your skills.&rdquo; Quaithe tilted her head, lacquered veil shifting with her, revealing only her bright silver eyes.</p><p>Helen plucked one of the flowers from her hair, allowing it to grow and weave its way around her arm, twisting into a bracer. Quaithe stood, shifting the table and chairs out of their way with a wave of her hand. She flicked her hand toward the fae girl, black flames surrounding her, low and smoldering.</p><p>A cool breeze blew in, like fresh snow, and the flames exploded into the air bringing a bright snowfall with them.</p><p>&ldquo;Now you&rsquo;re just showing off. It would have taken half the energy to created rain, even less a rain of blossoms or something similar. Or even better - you could have just drown it in ash.&rdquo;</p><p>The blonde stared up into her snowfall, flakes dotting her hair. &ldquo;But I thought we were having fun? Snow is more fun. Rain would ruin my hair.&rdquo;</p><p>Greens and blues flickered through the black of her hair as she shook her head at the girl. &ldquo;You will learn the value of conserving your energy, child. Even mine, with pure blood of Old Valyria, is not limitless.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Fine. A new game then. Who can outmatch the other using the least energy. &rdquo; Mischief flickered in Helen&rsquo;s blue-green eyes. The same eyes that the Blackthorn man wore with such sorrow.</p><p>The Valyrian removed her mask, allowing it to evaporate in silver wisps. &ldquo;Very well. But I have dealt with your kinds&rsquo; games before. Do not think you can best me with simple fairy tricks, girl.&rdquo;</p><p>Helen smiled sweetly. &ldquo;I would never dream of such a thing, Mistress Quaithe.&rdquo; The flowering vine wrapped around her wrist loosened, dropping two metal objects to the floor. The girl bent gracefully to grab them, the larger in her left and the smaller in her right.</p><p>Quaithe cursed in Valyrian. Helen was holding a stele and a seraph blade, smirking at her master&rsquo;s obvious surprise.</p><p>&ldquo;Stealing should have been made off limits.&rdquo;</p><p>The doors opened, admitting Jia and Andrew, who paused to take in the scene. Jia stared at the weapons Helen was holding. &ldquo;I must say, I agree. The Clave does frown upon stealing, although it is nice to see another Blackthorn wielding a blade.&rdquo;</p><p>Andrew just looked concerned. &ldquo;Is everything alright here?&rdquo;</p><p>Quiathe turned her back to Helen, facing the two shadowhunters. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re just training. Something to pass the time.&rdquo; She heard the girl move before their eyes even caught the movement. She flicked her wrist and a barrier prevented Helen from passing to complete her attack. Quaithe turned to poke at the barrier right above where Helen was glaring, trapped on the other side of the room. &ldquo;I told you, minimal energy. You tried to lure me into hand-to-hand combat with weapons that you know can injure me. So I used your angel blood against you. I can walk through this barrier, but nothing angelic can pass.&rdquo;</p><p>Jia stepped up to the barrier, curious. &ldquo;Strange. It takes warlocks immense preparation and energy to conjure this kind of ward.&rdquo;</p><p>Andrew put his hand on the barrier, as solid for him as it was for his daughter. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s because blood magic isn&rsquo;t natural for warlocks. Their magic is demonic in nature. Lady Quaithe is draconian. Her magic is of nature - fire and blood. That&rsquo;s where the saying comes from, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p><p>She lowered her hand and the barrier evaporated into flakes of silver, drifting to the floor like Helen&rsquo;s snowfall had before. &ldquo;You are mostly correct. It runs deeper than that, but that&rsquo;s an easy way to understand it.&rdquo;</p><p>Jia turned to face the rest of the room. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the Targaryen girl. A warlock contacted me about her and begged me to give her protection. I couldn&rsquo;t take it to the Clave because I had no way to say what she was, but it was clear she wasn&rsquo;t mundane - immune to heat, had the Sight, never been sick. She has no warlock mark, no magic that we can see, and she&rsquo;s in the care of her mad brother who wants to trade her for an army. I did what I could - I sent a shadowhunter to be her guard. But she&rsquo;s not what you are.&rdquo;</p><p>Quaithe shook her head. &ldquo;None of the Targaryens ever were. Some of my kind were born as dragons, some as I am, some with the ability to shift between. But our blood runs in that girl&rsquo;s veins, the blood of dragons. A single shadowhunter can only protect her so long as no one knows what she is.&rdquo;</p><p>Blackthorn paled. &ldquo;What would happen if someone knew what she was and sought to use her blood for some kind of magic?&rdquo;</p><p>Silver eyes flashed. She knew what he was asking. &ldquo;With the right dragon&rsquo;s blood and the right spell, someone could become as powerful as I am, infused with the magic of blood and fire, able to bring about the next Doom. If Valentine had successfully gotten to Rhaegar he would have brought about the end of all of us with non-angelic blood.&rdquo;</p><p>She could feel Helen&rsquo;s anger radiating, forcing her to motion. &ldquo;You and your Clave only ever cared about containing your Uprising. You did nothing to stop the genocide he committed against the last of their line. An entire race - decimated! The dragons - gone! What would we do if Rhaegar really was the last? Allow that magic to slip away from the world? Do you have any idea what is-&rdquo;</p><p>Quaithe shushed her. The Clave didn&rsquo;t need to know what the flames saw. They weren&rsquo;t ready. &ldquo;You said she had a shadowhunter with her. I assume that means you&rsquo;re receiving fire messages.&rdquo;</p><p>Jia nodded, pulling the folded, singed paper from a pocket in her leathers. Quaithe ran her hand along the edge, gathering the burned remains on her fingers. The ash whispered of grass and wind and open air. Some deep, primal part of her ached to fly.</p><p>Jia shuffled her feet, almost nervously. &ldquo;The shadowhunter with the princess is my daughter, Aline. She will not trust you and will view you as a threat, even if you take her,&rdquo; she nodded toward Helen, &ldquo;with you. Tell her to ask you the question, to which you will answer 'Only a pen.&rsquo; It&rsquo;s a bit of a joke. But she will know I sent you.&rdquo;</p><p>Quaithe nodded as she made her way up the steps, still rubbing the ash between her fingers, her mind picturing the exact place she was about to portal to. She could hear Helen saying an awkward farewell to her father, promising to visit the Institute in Dorne soon, and that she would send a fire message as soon as she was able.</p><p>As soon as the fae girl was by her side, the Valyrian blew the ash into the air, letting it shimmer as she moved her hands around it until the heat in the air was so intense, the air itself seemed to solidify into black glass, streaked with green and purple veins.</p><p>Helen holstered her stolen seraph blade and drew a few runes before tucking the stele away too. It wouldn&rsquo;t do to greet a suspicious shadowhunter and not look like a fellow nephilim. They walked through together, hearing the shattering of the thin glass behind them as they did.</p><p>The sun was high on the plains of the Great Grass Sea, and the cacophony of a khalasar was enough to drive anyone with mundane senses mad, much less Quaithe&rsquo;s Valyrian senses. Instinctively, her mask was back over her face, her hair and eyes glamoured, using much of her ability to maintain and suppress her magic.</p><p>Helen glanced around them, taking in the revelries they&rsquo;d stepped out into. &ldquo;It would appear you&rsquo;ve portaled us straight into a Dothraki wedding, Mistress.&rdquo; Their entrance appeared to have gone unnoticed, as they were behind what seemed to be an outcropping of rock, hidden from the high dais, where it would appear the newly married couple sat.</p><p>Quaithe took one look at the girl, silver hair flowing and violet eyes hiding a strength no one around seemed to see, and her own blood seemed to boil. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s her. I can sense her fire from here.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s great. How about we deal with this first, not that I&rsquo;m complaining or anything.&rdquo;</p><p>She turned to see Helen with a glowing seraph blade at her throat, a young shadowhunter who could only be Aline, immobilizing her.</p><p>The Valyrian removed her glamour and veil, almost in exasperation. &ldquo;Ask your question, Penhallow.&rdquo;</p><p>Aline stiffened, the blade twitching at Helen&rsquo;s throat. &ldquo;What will always defeat the blade?&rdquo;</p><p>Quaithe laughed. Jia was right, it was a bit of a joke. She flicked an unglamoured, taloned hand toward the two nephilim, taking Helen&rsquo;s stele from where it was tucked into her loose robes. She held up the adamas item so Aline could see it clearly. &ldquo;Only a pen.&rdquo;</p><hr /><p>Clary was beyond a loss for what was happening in front of her. The gigantic man who had claimed to be a wolf, or skinchanger, or whatever, was staring down at Lord Bane, almost with hesitation. Magnus held out his hand and the big wildling grasped his forearm, widening his stance as if prepared for pain. </p><p>She watched the man she only knew as a librarian and minor healer wave his hands, creating an aura of power around the two of them. Her attention was torn from the scene when Isabelle hissed in pain, grabbing at her own forearm. A knowing look passed between the two Lightwood boys and Alec went to Izzy immediately, speaking too quiet for Clary to hear. </p><p>Jace stepped near to her, pulling that pen-brand thing out again and waving it loosely in his hands. &ldquo;Bane activated our own memory runes so that we&rsquo;ll be able to see what he sees. I can give you the rune if you want, but I don&rsquo;t plan on marking you any more than you&rsquo;re prepared to handle. Earlier, I really just didn&rsquo;t plan to let you freeze.&rdquo; He shrugged and gave her a cocky smile, but it came off a bit more like a grimace. </p><p>She lifted her sleeve to reveal the heat rune, determination in the way she shoved her wrist at him. &ldquo;I told you, if it affects the safety of the family I serve, I have a right to know.&rdquo;</p><p>He seemed to evaluate her for a moment, looking her over with his mismatched eyes that somehow only made him more attractive. Or would, if he ever stopped acting so bloody arrogant. He took another step closer to her, holding her forearm firmly as if he expected her to jerk away. &ldquo;This is going to hurt, but we don&rsquo;t want to give away what the warlock is doing, so don&rsquo;t cry out.&rdquo;</p><p>Clary shot him an annoyed glare. She watched after direwolves, reigned in wild ladies, and trained for an unknown battle in secret with her mother. She wasn&rsquo;t some soft girl who fainted at the sight of blood. &ldquo;Get on with it or we might miss something important.&rdquo;</p><p>His golden hair reflected the fire in the tent as he shook his head, chuckling. &ldquo;Alec and Izzy have that covered,&rdquo; he gestured over his shoulder where the two had taken a seat, appearing to watch the process intently. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re just joining the party a bit late. Okay, brace yourself.&rdquo;</p><p>She stared past him at Magnus and the big man - Tormund. This whole thing was something that she&rsquo;d just accidentally wandered into and now part of it was searing into her skin, marking her as its own. Looks like you&rsquo;re one of us, Isabelle had said. Jace was right, this hurt worse than the other one. She focused on the memory of running into the group on the stairway, Nymeria nearly bowling Jace over, and the dumbfounded look on his face when he realized she could see him. She could see this world, could take the marks of these Shadowhunters, and maybe even share in the memories of this warlock and skinchanger. Just yesterday her biggest secret had been that she was as good a swordsman as Jon. </p><p>&ldquo;Done.&rdquo;</p><p>She glanced down at her arm, at the strange shape of the rune that could be an letter of some kind, but maybe a design of some kind? She wasn&rsquo;t sure, but she could feel the power it brought, feel the draw of the warlock&rsquo;s power. Somehow, she new what Magnus&rsquo; magic felt like. &ldquo;That wasn&rsquo;t nearly as bad as you made it seem.&rdquo;</p><p>He held out an arm, leading her to sit next to his siblings. &ldquo;Yes, well, you appear to be much tougher than the average mundane.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I thought I&rsquo;d made that rather clear. The strength of your skepticism is the true surprise here, Jace Wayland.&rdquo; Clary sat gracefully, as she&rsquo;d learned in the lessons with Arya and the Septa, not allowing him a chance to respond. </p><p>He huffed in annoyance as he sat next to her, leaning across her to touch the metal pen to the rune he&rsquo;d just marked, causing it to glow with a golden light and her mind to rush with images that were flooding from Magnus&rsquo; mind as it was linked to the skinchanger&rsquo;s. </p><p><i>A whole group of wildlings are huddled in this space, nuzzling close together, not lighting a fire, not wanting to draw attention to their family. No, family is the wrong word - Pack. They are pack. Some are in their mundane form, some are wolf, some are in-between with claws and fur on their face, eyes glowing when they open them. Their scent is all over this hut. It is time to go before something tracks them. He tells them to move. No one is happy, least of all his girls. They liked having a place to just spend with the pack. They liked to be able to stay wolf. Out in the woods, it&rsquo;s not safe. He keeps his pack as mundanes. </i></p><p><i>There&rsquo;s a village, but no smoke, no smell of mundanes, no sound of heartbeats. Just a sense of death. The girls don&rsquo;t like it, they want to go around, or double back and go back to the hut. But he wants to find safety, find some kind of alliance - another pack, another clan - anything, to keep the pack safe and together. He should have listened to the girls. They always did have better sense than him. They whimpered as they followed into the village. Everything was wrong. There were bodies but none of the wolves could smell blood. It all just smelled of ice and cold. It didn&rsquo;t smell like death, just felt like it. His pack spread out, searching for answers, for survivors. A bite could save an injured ally, it was their way. No survivors, just the bodies, strewn in a spiral. To wolves, the spiral means revenge. Gods only know what it means to these ice demons. </i></p><p><i>As we were divided, they stood, not a sound. Not even he, as the alpha, could hear their movements. But he could hear the screams of his pack - of his girls - as they were torn apart. He found them with throats ripped out, arms and legs torn off, and was attacked by the blue-eyed dead. His change to a great red wolf was seamless and he tossed them about like rag dolls. Until their master arrived - some great creature made of nothing but ice and bone. It screeched and he turned and saw his girls get up, still bloody and torn, eyes glowing blue instead of green, and move to attack him - their father and alpha. </i></p><p><i>He roared in rage, but it was to deaf ears. They weren&rsquo;t his wolves anymore. The grief and pain, the agony of the loss and trauma kept him a wolf. He stalked the woods, turning a new pack, more vicious and ready to fight than the other. Until he saw the full army of the dead. He and his new pack were far north, in the everwinter, piled in a safe cave, when it all passed by underneath them. Thousands of the creatures, all ranging in size - some beyond recognition of what they once were, others in various states of decay. All led by those ice demons who spoke only in screeches. North wasn&rsquo;t safe. He had to get his pack south, away from these things, as far south as they could get. He wouldn&rsquo;t lose anymore wolves to these bastards.</i></p><p><i>He wouldn&rsquo;t be caught in a war where his daughters were mindless pawns in the hands of demons. It was time to find a way out.</i></p>",
                "content_abstract": "<p>\n<p><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/15241917/chapters/35352096\">Read on ao3</a></p>\n<p>Arya ran up the steps to one of the of the small common homes along the keep&rsquo;s wall. She could hear Clary&rsquo;s friend Simon inside practicing as she banged on the solid wooden door. He stopped abruptly, and scuffling followed before the door flew open.</p>\n<p>Nymeria all but leaped on the musician, causing him to scramble back. &ldquo;Nym, heel.&rdquo; her wolf pup pulled back to sit and she watched Simon tried to retain his dignity as he straightened himself.</p>\n<p>He took her in, brown eyes widening, and bowed immediately in respect. &ldquo;Lady Arya. I&hellip; Why&hellip; Forgive me, m'lady, but what are you doing here? And why alone? Where&rsquo;s Clary?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Arya felt her rigid posture fall a little, and Nymeria reacted, baring fangs, startling the boy. So he didn&rsquo;t know where Clary had gone either. She pulled her shoulders back again, lifting her chin, a calming hand in her wolf&rsquo;s coat. Simon might be Clary&rsquo;s best friend, but she didn&rsquo;t know him and wasn&rsquo;t about to let him see she was panicking. &ldquo;I actually came to ask you about the night of the feast. You and Clary were dining with Jon, correct?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>He nodded, eyeing Nym fearfully. &ldquo;Yeah, but she kept staring at this empty table, as if she was watching someone or waiting for someone. It was weird. Even for Clary. Jon was being his usually brooding self and she just excused herself, marched up to Lord Bane, interrupting one of his stories, and he led her upstairs to the library. It was all so strange.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The wolf in Arya bristled at his failure to protect their mutual friend. &ldquo;And you didn&rsquo;t think it strange enough to follow? To investigate?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Simon at least had the decency to blush. He ran his hand through his messy dark hair. &ldquo;To be honest, m'lady, at first, I thought it was because your brother was being rather rude, if you&rsquo;ll excuse me saying. Once she&rsquo;d left in such a odd way, I had already been called upon to play by the king.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>She let her guard down a bit, causing even Nymeria to sit back and calm. She did recall that bit of the evening. The king had been quite insistent that his new minstrel demonstrate his skills for them all. Simon couldn&rsquo;t have followed Clary if he&rsquo;d wanted to. &ldquo;Very well. One last thing, you said she seemed like she was waiting for someone. Did she mention running into anyone from the king&rsquo;s party? Even in passing?&rdquo;</p>\n</p>",
