Here It is I&rsquo;ve been holding it forever!</p><p><i><b>&ldquo;The wind was blowing wet and heavy as they crossed the valley of the\u00a0Milkwater and rode singlefile through the river camp. Ghost kept close to Jon,\u00a0but the scent of him went before them like a herald, and soon there were wildling\u00a0dogs all around them, growling and barking. Lenyl screamed at them to be quiet,\u00a0but they paid him no heed. \u201cThey don\u2019t much care for that beast o\u2019 yours,\u201d\u00a0Longspear Ryk said to Jon. </b></i><i><b>\u201cThey\u2019re dogs and he\u2019s a wolf,\u201d said Jon. \u201cThey know he\u2019s not their kind.&rdquo;</b></i>\u00a0<i><span class=\"npf_color_chandler\">*No more than I am yours.*&ldquo;</span></i></p><p>In the books Ghost was with Jon when he was wildling&rsquo;s hostage as opposed to how in the show they made ghost wander off before Jon came across ygritte. Ghost is the reason Jon could kill Halfhand when he bites his calf but in the show Jon kills him on his own, in a single combat without any help also Jon uses Ghost to keep Ygritte away from him at night &amp; ghost even helps him because that&rsquo;s what Jon wants, just like ghost protects Sam &amp; cares for him because Jon cares for him &amp; because\u00a0that&rsquo;s what Jon wants. Ghost is Jon&rsquo;s extension of his\u00a0personality just like Drogon is to\u00a0Daenerys. Because the entire time that Jon was beyond the wall with him While he was a hostage ghost was an extension of his inner monologue. Outwardly Jon was playing\u00a0a turn cloak for the Wildlings but only ghost truly knew he never gave up on being a man of the Nights Watch.</p><p><b><i>&rdquo;*There were cookfires all along the river, amongst wayns and carts and sleds.\u00a0Many of the wildlings had thrown up tents, of hide and skin and felted wool.\u00a0Others sheltered behind rocks in crude lean-tos, or slept beneath their wagons.\u00a0At one fire Jon saw a man hardening the points of long wooden spears and\u00a0tossing them in a pile. Elsewhere two bearded youths in boiled leather were\u00a0sparring with staffs, leaping at each other over the flames, grunting each time\u00a0one landed a blow. A dozen women sat nearby in a circle, fletching arrows.</i></b>\u00a0<i><span class=\"npf_color_chandler\">Arrows for my brothers, Jon thought. Arrows for my father\u2019s folk, for the\u00a0people of Winterfell and Deepwood Motte and the Last Hearth. Arrows for the\u00a0north.*&ldquo;</span></i></p><p>This is where his undying fidelity for North comes to play he doesn&rsquo;t respect ryk, rattleshirt, weeper or ygritte! He doesn&rsquo;t yet know what it&rsquo;s like to be a ruler, a leader, he surely has those traits in him but still at heart being as young as he was (in the books) he\u00a0is a follower, of his old gods, his father&rsquo;s words &amp; his home of Winterfell along with his newest allegiance to Night&rsquo;s Watch. Ygritte wanted to change Jon&rsquo;s loyalty, she wanted him to help them raid &amp; ravage the lands of his father &amp; his fore-fathers but jon is way too loyal to his kind for that to happen just like arya is fiercely loyal to the north. Jon&rsquo;s &amp; ygritte&rsquo;s goals never matched, ever! But Jon still fell for ygritte nonetheless he kept his undying loyalty to the north but still fell for a Person who reminded him of arya. And in jonerys&rsquo;s case by the end of S07 Jon &amp; dany&rsquo;s goals matched. No matter how much people deny it by saying dany is still more focused on the conquest; night king killed her child she will destroy anyone who does that &amp; Jon feels guilty that\u00a0she lost her dragon because of him, that her house sigil is now incomplete because of him, there is guilt in her too for not trusting him. She wanted to help Jon in saving the north which is &amp; always has been\u00a0his goal. And to say dany&rsquo;s stubborn nature, rashness,\u00a0bravery &amp; her inclination to not only understand him but also to fly to a frozen, strange corner of the world to\u00a0help him on his word reminds him of arya would be an understatement!</p><p><i><span class=\"npf_color_chandler\">&rdquo;*But not all he saw was warlike.</span></i><i><b> He saw women\u00a0dancing as well, and heard a\u00a0baby crying, and a little boy ran in front of his garron, all bundled up in fur\u00a0and\u00a0breathless\u00a0from\u00a0play.\u00a0Sheep\u00a0and\u00a0goats\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0wandered freely, while oxen plodded\u00a0along the riverbank in search of grass. The smell of roast mutton drifted from\u00a0one cookflre, and at another he saw a boar turning on a wooden spit.. *&ldquo;</b></i></p><p>Jon idolized\u00a0King Daeron I Targaryen, the Young Dragon. He was a Bastard who was hungry for glory the likes of which he knew he won&rsquo;t find anywhere in the 7K but at the wall. So he joined the ancient order only to learn of it&rsquo;s receding ranks once honorable men of nights watch now reduced to reavers, rapers, cut-throats, thieves. Nobody as\u00a0honorable as his uncle or LCMormont. But he made his peace with the situation &amp; the First chance he got to get out there &amp; earn some valor &amp; make a name for himself like Qhorin Halfhand, that which he was so hungry for he took the chance! Which lead to series of events that spiralled out of his control he ended up falling for someone which he never intended &amp; he learned that\u00a0the price for glory is quite high! At this time he was a young boy who thought glory was easy that&rsquo;s why he looks at all the battlements &amp; instantly villainizes the wildlings. Only to realize with ygritte&rsquo;s death that there was no glory in killing the Wildlings so he tried to save them hoping to see the glory in that. Maybe there was glory in it being the first LC in the known history of the watch to have done so but the watch itself didn&rsquo;t think so &amp; ended up taking his life. The path to glory didn&rsquo;t turn out to be as promising as he thought in fact it was full of compromising crossroads. His loyalty to North never died but something else awoke him; the openess to considering all human life equal &amp; the fact that battle has two sides of compromising crossroads. He wasn&rsquo;t ready for Battle of the Bastards until he saw Rickon die up until then it looked like he was just going where his new life was taking him, he doesn&rsquo;t like fighting unnecessary battles unless it&rsquo;s against the dead &amp; for the living. He&rsquo;s a better leader for all that &amp; as a LC who wasn&rsquo;t afraid to do what nobody has done by saving &amp; taking Wildling&rsquo;s help against the dead &amp; he wasn&rsquo;t faking it! Even though Wildlings have been the enemy of the North when time came they helped save his life\u00a0against the watch itself; similarly he wasn&rsquo;t afraid of taking the Dragon Queen&rsquo;s help against the dead fully aware of the era-defining conflict between Starks &amp; Targaryens &amp; still being truthful in all his actions when time came the Dragon Queen came to his help &amp; saved his life too.\u00a0</p><p><i><b>&rdquo;*Can a bird hate? Jon had slain the wildling Orell, but some part of the man\u00a0remained within the eagle. The golden eyes looked out on him with cold\u00a0malevolence. \u201cI\u2019ll come,\u201d he said. The blood kept running down into his right\u00a0eye, and his cheek was a blaze of pain. When he touched it his black gloves\u00a0came away stained with red. \u201cLet me catch my garron.\u201d It was not the horse he\u00a0wanted so much as Ghost, but the direwolf was nowhere to be seen. He could be\u00a0leagues away by now, ripping out the throat of some elk. Perhaps that was just as\u00a0well.*&ldquo;</b></i></p><p>In the books Jon is a warg or atleast has shown warg-like traits, by far dreaming Ghost&rsquo;s vision &amp; inhabiting his mind initially\u00a0he wasn&rsquo;t sure what this exactly means. When orell&rsquo;s eagle attacked him he wasn&rsquo;t brutally harmed but still he wanted ghost close to him\u00a0similarly when he dies he called for Ghost. That was his last words\u00a0&quot;Ghost.. &quot;\u00a0</p><p>I believe everyone is aware of this very popular theory that before dying Jon warged into ghost. Like orell left a little bit of himself in his eagle, his most immediate emotion that he felt before dying that is hate &amp; revenge just like Jon who must&rsquo;ve felt the same before dying &amp; his calling was more of a defensive move since all his other defences were failing, ghost was what he needed at the very end. His\u00a0&rdquo;<i>Ghost</i>..&ldquo;\u00a0was just like daenerys's\u00a0&rdquo;<i>dracarys</i>&ldquo;.</p><p>Daenerys &amp; Jon&rsquo;s journey in\u00a0taming their magical beasts &amp; properly using them as the magical mythology of the WOIAF tells of\u00a0a magical beast like a\u00a0Dragon or direwolf were\u00a0used back in the time when both of them weren&rsquo;t unheard of, all Kings of Winter had a Direwolf &amp; some even rode into battle on the back of their direwolves &amp; most of the Starks of the Past were wargs , that&rsquo;s how they tamed such vicious beasts like direwolves. Once warged into a Direwolf that creates a life-long bond between the beast &amp; the warg.\u00a0Similarly all the Valyrians had dragons &amp; they rode into battle on the back of their dragons, Daenys the dreamer was a dragon dreamer who foresaw the doom of valyria making dragon dreams a recurring aspect in the blood of Old Valyria as daenerys had\u00a0dragon dreams too. Also dragons natural lifespan goes past the rider but the bond only breaks when the rider dies before that just like the wolves this bond is unbreakable too. So basically the show gave us a good view into the journey of dany taming her dragons &amp; becoming a dragon rider just like in\u00a0the books but with\u00a0Jon on the other hand unfortunately the t.v. show cut major arcs of his story related to Ghost.</p><p>Apart from being Jon Snow&rsquo;s Loyal Albino-red eyed pal ghost is very interesting in the books..</p><ul><li>Firstly when the Starks discover their direwolves all 5 of them belonging to the true born stark kids are huddled together but ghost was seperate from the group. His appearance is also very different to other direwolves with white fur &amp; red eyes. There is another theory that says Bloodraven often\u00a0warged into Ghost. That many'\u00a0a-times he used Ghost to get to Jon. For example when ghost brought jafar flowers hand warning the watch &amp; specifically Jon about the threat of the dead, then leading him to Jeor Mormont&rsquo;s chambers before the Wight attack, in the books Ghost leads Jon to cach\u00e8 of dragonglass hid by\u00a0the fist of the first men along with the Horn also when Jon tries to leave the Watch in the middle of the night it&rsquo;s ghost who gives away his position by moles town, he stops Jon from leaving the watch. Not that ghost was never himself or always warged by bloodraven or something but yeah a lot of times he was.</li><li>Apart from ghost there was another, jeor mormont&rsquo;s crow who is also believed to have been warged by bloodraven.</li></ul><p>Before bran falls off the tower he used to climb there to feed corn to the crows &amp; after his fall during his coma in his dreams bloodraven asks him\u00a0&rdquo;&hellip; say got any corn?&ldquo;\u00a0So bloodraven was basically keeping an eye on bran through one of the crows.. When jon talks about Bran&rsquo;s health with LCMormont his crow screams\u00a0<i>&quot;Corn! Corn! Corn!&quot;\u00a0</i>&amp; when jeor mormont informs Jon that bran is awake the crow screams\u00a0<i>&quot;Live! Live!&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;He rose &amp; dressed in darkness as mormont&rsquo;s raven muttered across the room. &quot;Corn&rdquo;, the bird said &amp;, &ldquo;King&rdquo;, &amp;, &ldquo;Snow, Jon Snow, Jon Snow.&rdquo; That was queer. The bird never said his full name before, as best Jon could recall&quot;\u00a0</i></p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<b> -Jon\u00a0AGOT</b></p><p><i>&ldquo;Do you think your Uncle Benjen was the only ranger we&rsquo;ve lost this past year?&rdquo; &ldquo;Ben Jen&rdquo;, the raven squawked, bobbing its head, bits of egg dribbling from its beak. &ldquo;Ben Jen.

While this was one of the many reasons why it was harder for dany to tame them but that isn&rsquo;t it. Daenerys locked them away for the sake of the safety of people of mereen like her ancestors who made the Dragon Pit to lock away their dragons. Being treated as a mere pet doesn&rsquo;t do well with dragons instead of being captured drogon escapes while Rhaegal &amp; Viserion are imprisoned. When daenerys tries to be a Queen unlike the Targaryen Queen that she should be &amp; sort of resists her Valyrian nature the dragons grow apart from her. For a long time Daenerys tried to be a different sort of queen for mereen so drogon knew he wouldn&rsquo;t survive the captivity like the dragons before him &amp; he escaped. But the bond never died as long as the blood of Old Valyria flows within dany she will always have a bond with the dragons. Drogon doesn&rsquo;t let her touch him until he returned to Daznak&rsquo;s fighting pits &amp; in a way\u00a0reminds her what she is &amp; she rides him for the first time.</li><li>Beyond the books what also happened is drogon gave her a taste of who she really is,\u00a0a Dragon in her own right! After which she burns\u00a0all the khals &amp; was reborn in the fires again which gained her drogon&rsquo;s allegiance.</li></ul><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1068\" data-orig-width=\"600\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/1897bb2ae03040b2d73deeaae0b3ff42/tumblr_pgsuo8syP31rc37p9_540.gif\" data-orig-height=\"1068\" data-orig-width=\"600\"/></figure><ul><li>I suppose there were elements of Jon&rsquo;s Targaryen heritage coming to play when drogon accepts his touch in S07. But it&rsquo;s not drogon who burns quentyn it&rsquo;s Rhaegal because quentyn tried to tame him without any blood of Old Valyria. Jon\u00a0embracing his Targaryen heritage will be complete when he becomes a dragon rider himself. But before that not only does drogon accept Jon but also recognizes something in Jon, drogon already has a rider so it was just a moment of recognition. Tyrion has also touched both Rhaegal &amp; Viserion but they didn&rsquo;t recognize anything in him except the fact that he isn&rsquo;t a foe &amp; they didn&rsquo;t harm him. Apart from recognizing blood in Jon; drogon is now not only a full grown embodiment of\u00a0Targaryen sigil but also an extension of daenerys&rsquo;s personality. That&rsquo;s why he is roaring while\u00a0dany is roaring her bloodriders speech. They have truly become bound to one another! Quaithe&rsquo;s words of remembering that she is blood of dragon is complete now because she has truly become a dragon, she&rsquo;s owning it!</li></ul><h2><b>Continued</b></h2>",

Here It is I\u2019ve been holding it forever!</p><p><i><b>\u201cThe wind was blowing wet and heavy as they crossed the valley of the\u00a0Milkwater and rode singlefile through the river camp. Ghost kept close to Jon,\u00a0but the scent of him went before them like a herald, and soon there were wildling\u00a0dogs all around them, growling and barking. Lenyl screamed at them to be quiet,\u00a0but they paid him no heed. \u201cThey don\u2019t much care for that beast o\u2019 yours,\u201d\u00a0Longspear Ryk said to Jon. </b></i><i><b>\u201cThey\u2019re dogs and he\u2019s a wolf,\u201d said Jon. \u201cThey know he\u2019s not their kind.\u201d</b></i>\u00a0<i><span class=\"npf_color_chandler\">*No more than I am yours.*\u201c</span></i></p><p>In the books Ghost was with Jon when he was wildling\u2019s hostage as opposed to how in the show they made ghost wander off before Jon came across ygritte. Ghost is the reason Jon could kill Halfhand when he bites his calf but in the show Jon kills him on his own, in a single combat without any help also Jon uses Ghost to keep Ygritte away from him at night &amp; ghost even helps him because that\u2019s what Jon wants, just like ghost protects Sam &amp; cares for him because Jon cares for him &amp; because\u00a0that\u2019s what Jon wants. Ghost is Jon\u2019s extension of his\u00a0personality just like Drogon is to\u00a0Daenerys. Because the entire time that Jon was beyond the wall with him While he was a hostage ghost was an extension of his inner monologue. Outwardly Jon was playing\u00a0a turn cloak for the Wildlings but only ghost truly knew he never gave up on being a man of the Nights Watch.</p><p><b><i>\u201d*There were cookfires all along the river, amongst wayns and carts and sleds.\u00a0Many of the wildlings had thrown up tents, of hide and skin and felted wool.\u00a0Others sheltered behind rocks in crude lean-tos, or slept beneath their wagons.\u00a0At one fire Jon saw a man hardening the points of long wooden spears and\u00a0tossing them in a pile. Elsewhere two bearded youths in boiled leather were\u00a0sparring with staffs, leaping at each other over the flames, grunting each time\u00a0one landed a blow. A dozen women sat nearby in a circle, fletching arrows.</i></b>\u00a0<i><span class=\"npf_color_chandler\">Arrows for my brothers, Jon thought. Arrows for my father\u2019s folk, for the\u00a0people of Winterfell and Deepwood Motte and the Last Hearth. Arrows for the\u00a0north.*\u201c</span></i></p><p>This is where his undying fidelity for North comes to play he doesn\u2019t respect ryk, rattleshirt, weeper or ygritte! He doesn\u2019t yet know what it\u2019s like to be a ruler, a leader, he surely has those traits in him but still at heart being as young as he was (in the books) he\u00a0is a follower, of his old gods, his father\u2019s words &amp; his home of Winterfell along with his newest allegiance to Night\u2019s Watch. Ygritte wanted to change Jon\u2019s loyalty, she wanted him to help them raid &amp; ravage the lands of his father &amp; his fore-fathers but jon is way too loyal to his kind for that to happen just like arya is fiercely loyal to the north. Jon\u2019s &amp; ygritte\u2019s goals never matched, ever! But Jon still fell for ygritte nonetheless he kept his undying loyalty to the north but still fell for a Person who reminded him of arya. And in jonerys\u2019s case by the end of S07 Jon &amp; dany\u2019s goals matched. No matter how much people deny it by saying dany is still more focused on the conquest; night king killed her child she will destroy anyone who does that &amp; Jon feels guilty that\u00a0she lost her dragon because of him, that her house sigil is now incomplete because of him, there is guilt in her too for not trusting him. She wanted to help Jon in saving the north which is &amp; always has been\u00a0his goal. And to say dany\u2019s stubborn nature, rashness,\u00a0bravery &amp; her inclination to not only understand him but also to fly to a frozen, strange corner of the world to\u00a0help him on his word reminds him of arya would be an understatement!</p><p><i><span class=\"npf_color_chandler\">\u201d*But not all he saw was warlike.</span></i><i><b> He saw women\u00a0dancing as well, and heard a\u00a0baby crying, and a little boy ran in front of his garron, all bundled up in fur\u00a0and\u00a0breathless\u00a0from\u00a0play.\u00a0Sheep\u00a0and\u00a0goats\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0wandered freely, while oxen plodded\u00a0along the riverbank in search of grass. The smell of roast mutton drifted from\u00a0one cookflre, and at another he saw a boar turning on a wooden spit.. *\u201c</b></i></p><p>Jon idolized\u00a0King Daeron I Targaryen, the Young Dragon. He was a Bastard who was hungry for glory the likes of which he knew he won\u2019t find anywhere in the 7K but at the wall. So he joined the ancient order only to learn of it\u2019s receding ranks once honorable men of nights watch now reduced to reavers, rapers, cut-throats, thieves. Nobody as\u00a0honorable as his uncle or LCMormont. But he made his peace with the situation &amp; the First chance he got to get out there &amp; earn some valor &amp; make a name for himself like Qhorin Halfhand, that which he was so hungry for he took the chance! Which lead to series of events that spiralled out of his control he ended up falling for someone which he never intended &amp; he learned that\u00a0the price for glory is quite high! At this time he was a young boy who thought glory was easy that\u2019s why he looks at all the battlements &amp; instantly villainizes the wildlings. Only to realize with ygritte\u2019s death that there was no glory in killing the Wildlings so he tried to save them hoping to see the glory in that. Maybe there was glory in it being the first LC in the known history of the watch to have done so but the watch itself didn\u2019t think so &amp; ended up taking his life. The path to glory didn\u2019t turn out to be as promising as he thought in fact it was full of compromising crossroads. His loyalty to North never died but something else awoke him; the openess to considering all human life equal &amp; the fact that battle has two sides of compromising crossroads. He wasn\u2019t ready for Battle of the Bastards until he saw Rickon die up until then it looked like he was just going where his new life was taking him, he doesn\u2019t like fighting unnecessary battles unless it\u2019s against the dead &amp; for the living. He\u2019s a better leader for all that &amp; as a LC who wasn\u2019t afraid to do what nobody has done by saving &amp; taking Wildling\u2019s help against the dead &amp; he wasn\u2019t faking it! Even though Wildlings have been the enemy of the North when time came they helped save his life\u00a0against the watch itself; similarly he wasn\u2019t afraid of taking the Dragon Queen\u2019s help against the dead fully aware of the era-defining conflict between Starks &amp; Targaryens &amp; still being truthful in all his actions when time came the Dragon Queen came to his help &amp; saved his life too.\u00a0</p><p><i><b>\u201d*Can a bird hate? Jon had slain the wildling Orell, but some part of the man\u00a0remained within the eagle. The golden eyes looked out on him with cold\u00a0malevolence. \u201cI\u2019ll come,\u201d he said. The blood kept running down into his right\u00a0eye, and his cheek was a blaze of pain. When he touched it his black gloves\u00a0came away stained with red. \u201cLet me catch my garron.\u201d It was not the horse he\u00a0wanted so much as Ghost, but the direwolf was nowhere to be seen. He could be\u00a0leagues away by now, ripping out the throat of some elk. Perhaps that was just as\u00a0well.*\u201c</b></i></p><p>In the books Jon is a warg or atleast has shown warg-like traits, by far dreaming Ghost\u2019s vision &amp; inhabiting his mind initially\u00a0he wasn\u2019t sure what this exactly means. When orell\u2019s eagle attacked him he wasn\u2019t brutally harmed but still he wanted ghost close to him\u00a0similarly when he dies he called for Ghost. That was his last words\u00a0\"Ghost.. \"\u00a0</p><p>I believe everyone is aware of this very popular theory that before dying Jon warged into ghost. Like orell left a little bit of himself in his eagle, his most immediate emotion that he felt before dying that is hate &amp; revenge just like Jon who must\u2019ve felt the same before dying &amp; his calling was more of a defensive move since all his other defences were failing, ghost was what he needed at the very end. His\u00a0\u201d<i>Ghost</i>..\u201c\u00a0was just like daenerys's\u00a0\u201d<i>dracarys</i>\u201c.</p><p>Daenerys &amp; Jon\u2019s journey in\u00a0taming their magical beasts &amp; properly using them as the magical mythology of the WOIAF tells of\u00a0a magical beast like a\u00a0Dragon or direwolf were\u00a0used back in the time when both of them weren\u2019t unheard of, all Kings of Winter had a Direwolf &amp; some even rode into battle on the back of their direwolves &amp; most of the Starks of the Past were wargs , that\u2019s how they tamed such vicious beasts like direwolves. Once warged into a Direwolf that creates a life-long bond between the beast &amp; the warg.\u00a0Similarly all the Valyrians had dragons &amp; they rode into battle on the back of their dragons, Daenys the dreamer was a dragon dreamer who foresaw the doom of valyria making dragon dreams a recurring aspect in the blood of Old Valyria as daenerys had\u00a0dragon dreams too. Also dragons natural lifespan goes past the rider but the bond only breaks when the rider dies before that just like the wolves this bond is unbreakable too. So basically the show gave us a good view into the journey of dany taming her dragons &amp; becoming a dragon rider just like in\u00a0the books but with\u00a0Jon on the other hand unfortunately the t.v. show cut major arcs of his story related to Ghost.</p><p>Apart from being Jon Snow\u2019s Loyal Albino-red eyed pal ghost is very interesting in the books..</p><ul><li>Firstly when the Starks discover their direwolves all 5 of them belonging to the true born stark kids are huddled together but ghost was seperate from the group. His appearance is also very different to other direwolves with white fur &amp; red eyes. There is another theory that says Bloodraven often\u00a0warged into Ghost. That many'\u00a0a-times he used Ghost to get to Jon. For example when ghost brought jafar flowers hand warning the watch &amp; specifically Jon about the threat of the dead, then leading him to Jeor Mormont\u2019s chambers before the Wight attack, in the books Ghost leads Jon to cach\u00e8 of dragonglass hid by\u00a0the fist of the first men along with the Horn also when Jon tries to leave the Watch in the middle of the night it\u2019s ghost who gives away his position by moles town, he stops Jon from leaving the watch. Not that ghost was never himself or always warged by bloodraven or something but yeah a lot of times he was.</li><li>Apart from ghost there was another, jeor mormont\u2019s crow who is also believed to have been warged by bloodraven.</li></ul><p>Before bran falls off the tower he used to climb there to feed corn to the crows &amp; after his fall during his coma in his dreams bloodraven asks him\u00a0\u201d\u2026 say got any corn?\u201c\u00a0So bloodraven was basically keeping an eye on bran through one of the crows.. When jon talks about Bran\u2019s health with LCMormont his crow screams\u00a0<i>\"Corn! Corn! Corn!\"\u00a0</i>&amp; when jeor mormont informs Jon that bran is awake the crow screams\u00a0<i>\"Live! Live!\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cHe rose &amp; dressed in darkness as mormont\u2019s raven muttered across the room. \"Corn\u201d, the bird said &amp;, \u201cKing\u201d, &amp;, \u201cSnow, Jon Snow, Jon Snow.\u201d That was queer.

In many ways dany trained them like she would\u2019ve trained her son.\u00a0</li></ul><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"230\" data-orig-width=\"500\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/a629abc195b2d02963431f39f22465b6/tumblr_pgsuomeQmJ1rc37p9_540.gif\" data-orig-height=\"230\" data-orig-width=\"500\"></figure><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"650\" data-orig-width=\"500\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/c5bca763c97b40df55afaf4e4de74b75/tumblr_pgsuolIyV41rc37p9_540.gif\" data-orig-height=\"650\" data-orig-width=\"500\"></figure><ul><li>Whenever daenerys acts like a Valyrian or behaves like a true Targaryen &amp; let\u2019s the Fire &amp; Blood in her out by commanding her dragons to do what they do best.

While this was one of the many reasons why it was harder for dany to tame them but that isn\u2019t it. Daenerys locked them away for the sake of the safety of people of mereen like her ancestors who made the Dragon Pit to lock away their dragons. Being treated as a mere pet doesn\u2019t do well with dragons instead of being captured drogon escapes while Rhaegal &amp; Viserion are imprisoned. When daenerys tries to be a Queen unlike the Targaryen Queen that she should be &amp; sort of resists her Valyrian nature the dragons grow apart from her. For a long time Daenerys tried to be a different sort of queen for mereen so drogon knew he wouldn\u2019t survive the captivity like the dragons before him &amp; he escaped. But the bond never died as long as the blood of Old Valyria flows within dany she will always have a bond with the dragons. Drogon doesn\u2019t let her touch him until he returned to Daznak\u2019s fighting pits &amp; in a way\u00a0reminds her what she is &amp; she rides him for the first time.</li><li>Beyond the books what also happened is drogon gave her a taste of who she really is,\u00a0a Dragon in her own right! After which she burns\u00a0all the khals &amp; was reborn in the fires again which gained her drogon\u2019s allegiance.</li></ul><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1068\" data-orig-width=\"600\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/1897bb2ae03040b2d73deeaae0b3ff42/tumblr_pgsuo8syP31rc37p9_540.gif\" data-orig-height=\"1068\" data-orig-width=\"600\"></figure><ul><li>I suppose there were elements of Jon\u2019s Targaryen heritage coming to play when drogon accepts his touch in S07. But it\u2019s not drogon who burns quentyn it\u2019s Rhaegal because quentyn tried to tame him without any blood of Old Valyria. Jon\u00a0embracing his Targaryen heritage will be complete when he becomes a dragon rider himself. But before that not only does drogon accept Jon but also recognizes something in Jon, drogon already has a rider so it was just a moment of recognition. Tyrion has also touched both Rhaegal &amp; Viserion but they didn\u2019t recognize anything in him except the fact that he isn\u2019t a foe &amp; they didn\u2019t harm him. Apart from recognizing blood in Jon; drogon is now not only a full grown embodiment of\u00a0Targaryen sigil but also an extension of daenerys\u2019s personality. That\u2019s why he is roaring while\u00a0dany is roaring her bloodriders speech. They have truly become bound to one another! Quaithe\u2019s words of remembering that she is blood of dragon is complete now because she has truly become a dragon, she\u2019s owning it!</li></ul><h2><b>Continued</b></h2></p>",

Here It is I\u2019ve been holding it forever!</p><p><i><b>\u201cThe wind was blowing wet and heavy as they crossed the valley of the\u00a0Milkwater and rode singlefile through the river camp. Ghost kept close to Jon,\u00a0but the scent of him went before them like a herald, and soon there were wildling\u00a0dogs all around them, growling and barking. Lenyl screamed at them to be quiet,\u00a0but they paid him no heed. \u201cThey don\u2019t much care for that beast o\u2019 yours,\u201d\u00a0Longspear Ryk said to Jon. </b></i><i><b>\u201cThey\u2019re dogs and he\u2019s a wolf,\u201d said Jon. \u201cThey know he\u2019s not their kind.\u201d</b></i>\u00a0<i><span class=\"npf_color_chandler\">*No more than I am yours.*\u201c</span></i></p><p>In the books Ghost was with Jon when he was wildling\u2019s hostage as opposed to how in the show they made ghost wander off before Jon came across ygritte. Ghost is the reason Jon could kill Halfhand when he bites his calf but in the show Jon kills him on his own, in a single combat without any help also Jon uses Ghost to keep Ygritte away from him at night &amp; ghost even helps him because that\u2019s what Jon wants, just like ghost protects Sam &amp; cares for him because Jon cares for him &amp; because\u00a0that\u2019s what Jon wants. Ghost is Jon\u2019s extension of his\u00a0personality just like Drogon is to\u00a0Daenerys. Because the entire time that Jon was beyond the wall with him While he was a hostage ghost was an extension of his inner monologue. Outwardly Jon was playing\u00a0a turn cloak for the Wildlings but only ghost truly knew he never gave up on being a man of the Nights Watch.</p><p><b><i>\u201d*There were cookfires all along the river, amongst wayns and carts and sleds.\u00a0Many of the wildlings had thrown up tents, of hide and skin and felted wool.\u00a0Others sheltered behind rocks in crude lean-tos, or slept beneath their wagons.\u00a0At one fire Jon saw a man hardening the points of long wooden spears and\u00a0tossing them in a pile. Elsewhere two bearded youths in boiled leather were\u00a0sparring with staffs, leaping at each other over the flames, grunting each time\u00a0one landed a blow. A dozen women sat nearby in a circle, fletching arrows.</i></b>\u00a0<i><span class=\"npf_color_chandler\">Arrows for my brothers, Jon thought. Arrows for my father\u2019s folk, for the\u00a0people of Winterfell and Deepwood Motte and the Last Hearth. Arrows for the\u00a0north.*\u201c</span></i></p><p>This is where his undying fidelity for North comes to play he doesn\u2019t respect ryk, rattleshirt, weeper or ygritte! He doesn\u2019t yet know what it\u2019s like to be a ruler, a leader, he surely has those traits in him but still at heart being as young as he was (in the books) he\u00a0is a follower, of his old gods, his father\u2019s words &amp; his home of Winterfell along with his newest allegiance to Night\u2019s Watch. Ygritte wanted to change Jon\u2019s loyalty, she wanted him to help them raid &amp; ravage the lands of his father &amp; his fore-fathers but jon is way too loyal to his kind for that to happen just like arya is fiercely loyal to the north. Jon\u2019s &amp; ygritte\u2019s goals never matched, ever! But Jon still fell for ygritte nonetheless he kept his undying loyalty to the north but still fell for a Person who reminded him of arya. And in jonerys\u2019s case by the end of S07 Jon &amp; dany\u2019s goals matched. No matter how much people deny it by saying dany is still more focused on the conquest; night king killed her child she will destroy anyone who does that &amp; Jon feels guilty that\u00a0she lost her dragon because of him, that her house sigil is now incomplete because of him, there is guilt in her too for not trusting him. She wanted to help Jon in saving the north which is &amp; always has been\u00a0his goal. And to say dany\u2019s stubborn nature, rashness,\u00a0bravery &amp; her inclination to not only understand him but also to fly to a frozen, strange corner of the world to\u00a0help him on his word reminds him of arya would be an understatement!</p><p><i><span class=\"npf_color_chandler\">\u201d*But not all he saw was warlike.</span></i><i><b> He saw women\u00a0dancing as well, and heard a\u00a0baby crying, and a little boy ran in front of his garron, all bundled up in fur\u00a0and\u00a0breathless\u00a0from\u00a0play.\u00a0Sheep\u00a0and\u00a0goats\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0wandered freely, while oxen plodded\u00a0along the riverbank in search of grass. The smell of roast mutton drifted from\u00a0one cookflre, and at another he saw a boar turning on a wooden spit.. *\u201c</b></i></p><p>Jon idolized\u00a0King Daeron I Targaryen, the Young Dragon. He was a Bastard who was hungry for glory the likes of which he knew he won\u2019t find anywhere in the 7K but at the wall. So he joined the ancient order only to learn of it\u2019s receding ranks once honorable men of nights watch now reduced to reavers, rapers, cut-throats, thieves. Nobody as\u00a0honorable as his uncle or LCMormont. But he made his peace with the situation &amp; the First chance he got to get out there &amp; earn some valor &amp; make a name for himself like Qhorin Halfhand, that which he was so hungry for he took the chance! Which lead to series of events that spiralled out of his control he ended up falling for someone which he never intended &amp; he learned that\u00a0the price for glory is quite high! At this time he was a young boy who thought glory was easy that\u2019s why he looks at all the battlements &amp; instantly villainizes the wildlings. Only to realize with ygritte\u2019s death that there was no glory in killing the Wildlings so he tried to save them hoping to see the glory in that. Maybe there was glory in it being the first LC in the known history of the watch to have done so but the watch itself didn\u2019t think so &amp; ended up taking his life. The path to glory didn\u2019t turn out to be as promising as he thought in fact it was full of compromising crossroads. His loyalty to North never died but something else awoke him; the openess to considering all human life equal &amp; the fact that battle has two sides of compromising crossroads. He wasn\u2019t ready for Battle of the Bastards until he saw Rickon die up until then it looked like he was just going where his new life was taking him, he doesn\u2019t like fighting unnecessary battles unless it\u2019s against the dead &amp; for the living. He\u2019s a better leader for all that &amp; as a LC who wasn\u2019t afraid to do what nobody has done by saving &amp; taking Wildling\u2019s help against the dead &amp; he wasn\u2019t faking it! Even though Wildlings have been the enemy of the North when time came they helped save his life\u00a0against the watch itself; similarly he wasn\u2019t afraid of taking the Dragon Queen\u2019s help against the dead fully aware of the era-defining conflict between Starks &amp; Targaryens &amp; still being truthful in all his actions when time came the Dragon Queen came to his help &amp; saved his life too.\u00a0</p><p><i><b>\u201d*Can a bird hate? Jon had slain the wildling Orell, but some part of the man\u00a0remained within the eagle. The golden eyes looked out on him with cold\u00a0malevolence. \u201cI\u2019ll come,\u201d he said. The blood kept running down into his right\u00a0eye, and his cheek was a blaze of pain. When he touched it his black gloves\u00a0came away stained with red. \u201cLet me catch my garron.\u201d It was not the horse he\u00a0wanted so much as Ghost, but the direwolf was nowhere to be seen. He could be\u00a0leagues away by now, ripping out the throat of some elk. Perhaps that was just as\u00a0well.*\u201c</b></i></p><p>In the books Jon is a warg or atleast has shown warg-like traits, by far dreaming Ghost\u2019s vision &amp; inhabiting his mind initially\u00a0he wasn\u2019t sure what this exactly means. When orell\u2019s eagle attacked him he wasn\u2019t brutally harmed but still he wanted ghost close to him\u00a0similarly when he dies he called for Ghost. That was his last words\u00a0\"Ghost.. \"\u00a0</p><p>I believe everyone is aware of this very popular theory that before dying Jon warged into ghost. Like orell left a little bit of himself in his eagle, his most immediate emotion that he felt before dying that is hate &amp; revenge just like Jon who must\u2019ve felt the same before dying &amp; his calling was more of a defensive move since all his other defences were failing, ghost was what he needed at the very end. His\u00a0\u201d<i>Ghost</i>..\u201c\u00a0was just like daenerys's\u00a0\u201d<i>dracarys</i>\u201c.</p><p>Daenerys &amp; Jon\u2019s journey in\u00a0taming their magical beasts &amp; properly using them as the magical mythology of the WOIAF tells of\u00a0a magical beast like a\u00a0Dragon or direwolf were\u00a0used back in the time when both of them weren\u2019t unheard of, all Kings of Winter had a Direwolf &amp; some even rode into battle on the back of their direwolves &amp; most of the Starks of the Past were wargs , that\u2019s how they tamed such vicious beasts like direwolves. Once warged into a Direwolf that creates a life-long bond between the beast &amp; the warg.\u00a0Similarly all the Valyrians had dragons &amp; they rode into battle on the back of their dragons, Daenys the dreamer was a dragon dreamer who foresaw the doom of valyria making dragon dreams a recurring aspect in the blood of Old Valyria as daenerys had\u00a0dragon dreams too. Also dragons natural lifespan goes past the rider but the bond only breaks when the rider dies before that just like the wolves this bond is unbreakable too. So basically the show gave us a good view into the journey of dany taming her dragons &amp; becoming a dragon rider just like in\u00a0the books but with\u00a0Jon on the other hand unfortunately the t.v. show cut major arcs of his story related to Ghost.</p><p>Apart from being Jon Snow\u2019s Loyal Albino-red eyed pal ghost is very interesting in the books..</p><ul><li>Firstly when the Starks discover their direwolves all 5 of them belonging to the true born stark kids are huddled together but ghost was seperate from the group. His appearance is also very different to other direwolves with white fur &amp; red eyes. There is another theory that says Bloodraven often\u00a0warged into Ghost. That many'\u00a0a-times he used Ghost to get to Jon. For example when ghost brought jafar flowers hand warning the watch &amp; specifically Jon about the threat of the dead, then leading him to Jeor Mormont\u2019s chambers before the Wight attack, in the books Ghost leads Jon to cach\u00e8 of dragonglass hid by\u00a0the fist of the first men along with the Horn also when Jon tries to leave the Watch in the middle of the night it\u2019s ghost who gives away his position by moles town, he stops Jon from leaving the watch. Not that ghost was never himself or always warged by bloodraven or something but yeah a lot of times he was.</li><li>Apart from ghost there was another, jeor mormont\u2019s crow who is also believed to have been warged by bloodraven.</li></ul><p>Before bran falls off the tower he used to climb there to feed corn to the crows &amp; after his fall during his coma in his dreams bloodraven asks him\u00a0\u201d\u2026 say got any corn?\u201c\u00a0So bloodraven was basically keeping an eye on bran through one of the crows.. When jon talks about Bran\u2019s health with LCMormont his crow screams\u00a0<i>\"Corn! Corn! Corn!\"\u00a0</i>&amp; when jeor mormont informs Jon that bran is awake the crow screams\u00a0<i>\"Live! Live!\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cHe rose &amp; dressed in darkness as mormont\u2019s raven muttered across the room. \"Corn\u201d, the bird said &amp;, \u201cKing\u201d, &amp;, \u201cSnow, Jon Snow, Jon Snow.\u201d That was queer.

While this was one of the many reasons why it was harder for dany to tame them but that isn\u2019t it. Daenerys locked them away for the sake of the safety of people of mereen like her ancestors who made the Dragon Pit to lock away their dragons. Being treated as a mere pet doesn\u2019t do well with dragons instead of being captured drogon escapes while Rhaegal &amp; Viserion are imprisoned. When daenerys tries to be a Queen unlike the Targaryen Queen that she should be &amp; sort of resists her Valyrian nature the dragons grow apart from her. For a long time Daenerys tried to be a different sort of queen for mereen so drogon knew he wouldn\u2019t survive the captivity like the dragons before him &amp; he escaped. But the bond never died as long as the blood of Old Valyria flows within dany she will always have a bond with the dragons. Drogon doesn\u2019t let her touch him until he returned to Daznak\u2019s fighting pits &amp; in a way\u00a0reminds her what she is &amp; she rides him for the first time.</li><li>Beyond the books what also happened is drogon gave her a taste of who she really is,\u00a0a Dragon in her own right! After which she burns\u00a0all the khals &amp; was reborn in the fires again which gained her drogon\u2019s allegiance.</li></ul><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1068\" data-orig-width=\"600\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/1897bb2ae03040b2d73deeaae0b3ff42/tumblr_pgsuo8syP31rc37p9_540.gif\" data-orig-height=\"1068\" data-orig-width=\"600\"></figure><ul><li>I suppose there were elements of Jon\u2019s Targaryen heritage coming to play when drogon accepts his touch in S07. But it\u2019s not drogon who burns quentyn it\u2019s Rhaegal because quentyn tried to tame him without any blood of Old Valyria. Jon\u00a0embracing his Targaryen heritage will be complete when he becomes a dragon rider himself. But before that not only does drogon accept Jon but also recognizes something in Jon, drogon already has a rider so it was just a moment of recognition. Tyrion has also touched both Rhaegal &amp; Viserion but they didn\u2019t recognize anything in him except the fact that he isn\u2019t a foe &amp; they didn\u2019t harm him. Apart from recognizing blood in Jon; drogon is now not only a full grown embodiment of\u00a0Targaryen sigil but also an extension of daenerys\u2019s personality. That\u2019s why he is roaring while\u00a0dany is roaring her bloodriders speech. They have truly become bound to one another! Quaithe\u2019s words of remembering that she is blood of dragon is complete now because she has truly become a dragon, she\u2019s owning it!</li></ul><h2><b>Continued</b></h2></p>",

Here It is I&rsquo;ve been holding it forever!</p><p><i><b>&ldquo;The wind was blowing wet and heavy as they crossed the valley of the&nbsp;Milkwater and rode singlefile through the river camp. Ghost kept close to Jon,&nbsp;but the scent of him went before them like a herald, and soon there were wildling&nbsp;dogs all around them, growling and barking. Lenyl screamed at them to be quiet,&nbsp;but they paid him no heed. &ldquo;They don&rsquo;t much care for that beast o&rsquo; yours,&rdquo;&nbsp;Longspear Ryk said to Jon. </b></i><i><b>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re dogs and he&rsquo;s a wolf,&rdquo; said Jon. &ldquo;They know he&rsquo;s not their kind.&rdquo;</b></i>&nbsp;<i><span class=\"npf_color_chandler\">*No more than I am yours.*&ldquo;</span></i></p><p>In the books Ghost was with Jon when he was wildling&rsquo;s hostage as opposed to how in the show they made ghost wander off before Jon came across ygritte. Ghost is the reason Jon could kill Halfhand when he bites his calf but in the show Jon kills him on his own, in a single combat without any help also Jon uses Ghost to keep Ygritte away from him at night &amp; ghost even helps him because that&rsquo;s what Jon wants, just like ghost protects Sam &amp; cares for him because Jon cares for him &amp; because&nbsp;that&rsquo;s what Jon wants. Ghost is Jon&rsquo;s extension of his&nbsp;personality just like Drogon is to&nbsp;Daenerys. Because the entire time that Jon was beyond the wall with him While he was a hostage ghost was an extension of his inner monologue. Outwardly Jon was playing&nbsp;a turn cloak for the Wildlings but only ghost truly knew he never gave up on being a man of the Nights Watch.</p><p><b><i>&rdquo;*There were cookfires all along the river, amongst wayns and carts and sleds.&nbsp;Many of the wildlings had thrown up tents, of hide and skin and felted wool.&nbsp;Others sheltered behind rocks in crude lean-tos, or slept beneath their wagons.&nbsp;At one fire Jon saw a man hardening the points of long wooden spears and&nbsp;tossing them in a pile. Elsewhere two bearded youths in boiled leather were&nbsp;sparring with staffs, leaping at each other over the flames, grunting each time&nbsp;one landed a blow. A dozen women sat nearby in a circle, fletching arrows.</i></b>&nbsp;<i><span class=\"npf_color_chandler\">Arrows for my brothers, Jon thought. Arrows for my father&rsquo;s folk, for the&nbsp;people of Winterfell and Deepwood Motte and the Last Hearth. Arrows for the&nbsp;north.*&ldquo;</span></i></p><p>This is where his undying fidelity for North comes to play he doesn&rsquo;t respect ryk, rattleshirt, weeper or ygritte! He doesn&rsquo;t yet know what it&rsquo;s like to be a ruler, a leader, he surely has those traits in him but still at heart being as young as he was (in the books) he&nbsp;is a follower, of his old gods, his father&rsquo;s words &amp; his home of Winterfell along with his newest allegiance to Night&rsquo;s Watch. Ygritte wanted to change Jon&rsquo;s loyalty, she wanted him to help them raid &amp; ravage the lands of his father &amp; his fore-fathers but jon is way too loyal to his kind for that to happen just like arya is fiercely loyal to the north. Jon&rsquo;s &amp; ygritte&rsquo;s goals never matched, ever! But Jon still fell for ygritte nonetheless he kept his undying loyalty to the north but still fell for a Person who reminded him of arya. And in jonerys&rsquo;s case by the end of S07 Jon &amp; dany&rsquo;s goals matched. No matter how much people deny it by saying dany is still more focused on the conquest; night king killed her child she will destroy anyone who does that &amp; Jon feels guilty that&nbsp;she lost her dragon because of him, that her house sigil is now incomplete because of him, there is guilt in her too for not trusting him. She wanted to help Jon in saving the north which is &amp; always has been&nbsp;his goal. And to say dany&rsquo;s stubborn nature, rashness,&nbsp;bravery &amp; her inclination to not only understand him but also to fly to a frozen, strange corner of the world to&nbsp;help him on his word reminds him of arya would be an understatement!</p><p><i><span class=\"npf_color_chandler\">&rdquo;*But not all he saw was warlike.</span></i><i><b> He saw women&nbsp;dancing as well, and heard a&nbsp;baby crying, and a little boy ran in front of his garron, all bundled up in fur&nbsp;and&nbsp;breathless&nbsp;from&nbsp;play.&nbsp;Sheep&nbsp;and&nbsp;goats&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wandered freely, while oxen plodded&nbsp;along the riverbank in search of grass. The smell of roast mutton drifted from&nbsp;one cookflre, and at another he saw a boar turning on a wooden spit.. *&ldquo;</b></i></p><p>Jon idolized&nbsp;King Daeron I Targaryen, the Young Dragon. He was a Bastard who was hungry for glory the likes of which he knew he won&rsquo;t find anywhere in the 7K but at the wall. So he joined the ancient order only to learn of it&rsquo;s receding ranks once honorable men of nights watch now reduced to reavers, rapers, cut-throats, thieves. Nobody as&nbsp;honorable as his uncle or LCMormont. But he made his peace with the situation &amp; the First chance he got to get out there &amp; earn some valor &amp; make a name for himself like Qhorin Halfhand, that which he was so hungry for he took the chance! Which lead to series of events that spiralled out of his control he ended up falling for someone which he never intended &amp; he learned that&nbsp;the price for glory is quite high! At this time he was a young boy who thought glory was easy that&rsquo;s why he looks at all the battlements &amp; instantly villainizes the wildlings. Only to realize with ygritte&rsquo;s death that there was no glory in killing the Wildlings so he tried to save them hoping to see the glory in that. Maybe there was glory in it being the first LC in the known history of the watch to have done so but the watch itself didn&rsquo;t think so &amp; ended up taking his life. The path to glory didn&rsquo;t turn out to be as promising as he thought in fact it was full of compromising crossroads. His loyalty to North never died but something else awoke him; the openess to considering all human life equal &amp; the fact that battle has two sides of compromising crossroads. He wasn&rsquo;t ready for Battle of the Bastards until he saw Rickon die up until then it looked like he was just going where his new life was taking him, he doesn&rsquo;t like fighting unnecessary battles unless it&rsquo;s against the dead &amp; for the living. He&rsquo;s a better leader for all that &amp; as a LC who wasn&rsquo;t afraid to do what nobody has done by saving &amp; taking Wildling&rsquo;s help against the dead &amp; he wasn&rsquo;t faking it! Even though Wildlings have been the enemy of the North when time came they helped save his life&nbsp;against the watch itself; similarly he wasn&rsquo;t afraid of taking the Dragon Queen&rsquo;s help against the dead fully aware of the era-defining conflict between Starks &amp; Targaryens &amp; still being truthful in all his actions when time came the Dragon Queen came to his help &amp; saved his life too.&nbsp;</p><p><i><b>&rdquo;*Can a bird hate? Jon had slain the wildling Orell, but some part of the man&nbsp;remained within the eagle. The golden eyes looked out on him with cold&nbsp;malevolence. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come,&rdquo; he said. The blood kept running down into his right&nbsp;eye, and his cheek was a blaze of pain. When he touched it his black gloves&nbsp;came away stained with red. &ldquo;Let me catch my garron.&rdquo; It was not the horse he&nbsp;wanted so much as Ghost, but the direwolf was nowhere to be seen. He could be&nbsp;leagues away by now, ripping out the throat of some elk. Perhaps that was just as&nbsp;well.*&ldquo;</b></i></p><p>In the books Jon is a warg or atleast has shown warg-like traits, by far dreaming Ghost&rsquo;s vision &amp; inhabiting his mind initially&nbsp;he wasn&rsquo;t sure what this exactly means. When orell&rsquo;s eagle attacked him he wasn&rsquo;t brutally harmed but still he wanted ghost close to him&nbsp;similarly when he dies he called for Ghost. That was his last words&nbsp;\"Ghost.. \"&nbsp;</p><p>I believe everyone is aware of this very popular theory that before dying Jon warged into ghost. Like orell left a little bit of himself in his eagle, his most immediate emotion that he felt before dying that is hate &amp; revenge just like Jon who must&rsquo;ve felt the same before dying &amp; his calling was more of a defensive move since all his other defences were failing, ghost was what he needed at the very end. His&nbsp;&rdquo;<i>Ghost</i>..&ldquo;&nbsp;was just like daenerys's&nbsp;&rdquo;<i>dracarys</i>&ldquo;.</p><p>Daenerys &amp; Jon&rsquo;s journey in&nbsp;taming their magical beasts &amp; properly using them as the magical mythology of the WOIAF tells of&nbsp;a magical beast like a&nbsp;Dragon or direwolf were&nbsp;used back in the time when both of them weren&rsquo;t unheard of, all Kings of Winter had a Direwolf &amp; some even rode into battle on the back of their direwolves &amp; most of the Starks of the Past were wargs , that&rsquo;s how they tamed such vicious beasts like direwolves. Once warged into a Direwolf that creates a life-long bond between the beast &amp; the warg.&nbsp;Similarly all the Valyrians had dragons &amp; they rode into battle on the back of their dragons, Daenys the dreamer was a dragon dreamer who foresaw the doom of valyria making dragon dreams a recurring aspect in the blood of Old Valyria as daenerys had&nbsp;dragon dreams too. Also dragons natural lifespan goes past the rider but the bond only breaks when the rider dies before that just like the wolves this bond is unbreakable too. So basically the show gave us a good view into the journey of dany taming her dragons &amp; becoming a dragon rider just like in&nbsp;the books but with&nbsp;Jon on the other hand unfortunately the t.v. show cut major arcs of his story related to Ghost.</p><p>Apart from being Jon Snow&rsquo;s Loyal Albino-red eyed pal ghost is very interesting in the books..</p><ul><li>Firstly when the Starks discover their direwolves all 5 of them belonging to the true born stark kids are huddled together but ghost was seperate from the group. His appearance is also very different to other direwolves with white fur &amp; red eyes. There is another theory that says Bloodraven often&nbsp;warged into Ghost. That many'&nbsp;a-times he used Ghost to get to Jon. For example when ghost brought jafar flowers hand warning the watch &amp; specifically Jon about the threat of the dead, then leading him to Jeor Mormont&rsquo;s chambers before the Wight attack, in the books Ghost leads Jon to cach&egrave; of dragonglass hid by&nbsp;the fist of the first men along with the Horn also when Jon tries to leave the Watch in the middle of the night it&rsquo;s ghost who gives away his position by moles town, he stops Jon from leaving the watch. Not that ghost was never himself or always warged by bloodraven or something but yeah a lot of times he was.</li><li>Apart from ghost there was another, jeor mormont&rsquo;s crow who is also believed to have been warged by bloodraven.</li></ul><p>Before bran falls off the tower he used to climb there to feed corn to the crows &amp; after his fall during his coma in his dreams bloodraven asks him&nbsp;&rdquo;&hellip; say got any corn?&ldquo;&nbsp;So bloodraven was basically keeping an eye on bran through one of the crows.. When jon talks about Bran&rsquo;s health with LCMormont his crow screams&nbsp;<i>\"Corn! Corn! Corn!\"&nbsp;</i>&amp; when jeor mormont informs Jon that bran is awake the crow screams&nbsp;<i>\"Live! Live!&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;He rose &amp; dressed in darkness as mormont&rsquo;s raven muttered across the room. \"Corn&rdquo;, the bird said &amp;, &ldquo;King&rdquo;, &amp;, &ldquo;Snow, Jon Snow, Jon Snow.&rdquo; That was queer. The bird never said his full name before, as best Jon could recall\"&nbsp;</i></p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b> -Jon&nbsp;AGOT</b></p><p><i>&ldquo;Do you think your Uncle Benjen was the only ranger we&rsquo;ve lost this past year?&rdquo; &ldquo;Ben Jen&rdquo;, the raven squawked, bobbing its head, bits of egg dribbling from its beak. &ldquo;Ben Jen.

In many ways dany trained them like she would&rsquo;ve trained her son.&nbsp;</li></ul><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/a629abc195b2d02963431f39f22465b6/tumblr_pgsuomeQmJ1rc37p9_540.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/c5bca763c97b40df55afaf4e4de74b75/tumblr_pgsuolIyV41rc37p9_540.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><ul><li>Whenever daenerys acts like a Valyrian or behaves like a true Targaryen &amp; let&rsquo;s the Fire &amp; Blood in her out by commanding her dragons to do what they do best. Whenever daenerys let&rsquo;s the dragons behave like themselves they grow closer to her. Their bond shows best at such a time.</li></ul><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/30fc919e3affe27c2b1cb1b27f437525/tumblr_pgsuooovVI1rc37p9_540.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><ul><li>Again when daenerys acts like a Valyrian during the sacking of Astaphor &amp; truly allows the greatest weapons of war in the world her Dragons to do what they do best she brings them closer to herself.</li></ul><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/5e7d477197923e5fddf03f3309e751af/tumblr_pgsuoh8z6u1rc37p9_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/af8eb75c977e0542b2f09dee120fc672/tumblr_pgsuokSjrL1rc37p9_540.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/83bee9ef86978dbb7ff4aa7a1059675e/tumblr_pgsuo1YZpz1rc37p9_540.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><ul><li>And then as the dragons grew in age &amp; in size their viciousness grew as well &amp; they became harder to be tamed. While this was one of the many reasons why it was harder for dany to tame them but that isn&rsquo;t it. Daenerys locked them away for the sake of the safety of people of mereen like her ancestors who made the Dragon Pit to lock away their dragons. Being treated as a mere pet doesn&rsquo;t do well with dragons instead of being captured drogon escapes while Rhaegal &amp; Viserion are imprisoned. When daenerys tries to be a Queen unlike the Targaryen Queen that she should be &amp; sort of resists her Valyrian nature the dragons grow apart from her. For a long time Daenerys tried to be a different sort of queen for mereen so drogon knew he wouldn&rsquo;t survive the captivity like the dragons before him &amp; he escaped. But the bond never died as long as the blood of Old Valyria flows within dany she will always have a bond with the dragons. Drogon doesn&rsquo;t let her touch him until he returned to Daznak&rsquo;s fighting pits &amp; in a way&nbsp;reminds her what she is &amp; she rides him for the first time.</li><li>Beyond the books what also happened is drogon gave her a taste of who she really is,&nbsp;a Dragon in her own right! After which she burns&nbsp;all the khals &amp; was reborn in the fires again which gained her drogon&rsquo;s allegiance.</li></ul><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/1897bb2ae03040b2d73deeaae0b3ff42/tumblr_pgsuo8syP31rc37p9_540.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><ul><li>I suppose there were elements of Jon&rsquo;s Targaryen heritage coming to play when drogon accepts his touch in S07. But it&rsquo;s not drogon who burns quentyn it&rsquo;s Rhaegal because quentyn tried to tame him without any blood of Old Valyria. Jon&nbsp;embracing his Targaryen heritage will be complete when he becomes a dragon rider himself. But before that not only does drogon accept Jon but also recognizes something in Jon, drogon already has a rider so it was just a moment of recognition. Tyrion has also touched both Rhaegal &amp; Viserion but they didn&rsquo;t recognize anything in him except the fact that he isn&rsquo;t a foe &amp; they didn&rsquo;t harm him. Apart from recognizing blood in Jon; drogon is now not only a full grown embodiment of&nbsp;Targaryen sigil but also an extension of daenerys&rsquo;s personality. That&rsquo;s why he is roaring while&nbsp;dany is roaring her bloodriders speech. They have truly become bound to one another! Quaithe&rsquo;s words of remembering that she is blood of dragon is complete now because she has truly become a dragon, she&rsquo;s owning it!</li></ul><h2><b>Continued</b></h2></p>",

        "question": "Hi!! I was wondering what do you think is Jon's plan for after the Great War? Is he going to accept Daenerys as his queen or does he have a plan to get rid of her?? It seems to me that if Jon doesn't have a plan for after the war regarding D then it doesn't matter if he meant it when he bent the knee to her, if he has no way out, he still will have no choice but to submit to her, esp because she'll have dragons & her army in the heart the north, so she can retaliate brutally to any betrayal",
        "answer": "<p>Hey! <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mZscJpN6V7Ag-T9-SMVVDsA\">@atimeforjonsa</a> Thanks for the ask! That\u2019s a great question. I don\u2019t think Jon has a plan for Daenerys because I don\u2019t think he expects to survive the Great War. My personal perspective of political Jon is that he didn\u2019t have this thorough, thought out, strategic plan but he basically made \u201cstrategic impulsive choices\u201d along the way as he found himself continuously backed into a corner. Mind you, I don\u2019t think he wanted to make any of these choices but his main goal was to get Daenerys and her dragons North so that his people and his family had some semblance of a chance to survive! </p><p>Jon has always had that sacrificial lamb thing going for him. He views himself as \u201cthe protector of men and defender of the realm.\u201d I 100% believe that part of the reason Jon made some of the choices he did in season 7 was because he truly doesn\u2019t believe he will survive the war. His main focus has always been to defend the realm and specifically to defend his people against the White Walkers. Beyond that I don\u2019t think Jon has given anything else, including Daenerys much thought. He was able to accomplish what he set out to do which was to get Daenerys North and I think that\u2019s all he cares about at the moment instead of the political consequences.</p><p>Hopefully I was able to answer your question! \ud83d\ude0a</p>",
