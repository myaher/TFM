From the moment you woke up today\nit`s been nothing but bad luck, clumsiness and people being annoyed. First your\nfavorite mug broke when you managed to throw it from the counter. Then you\nstepped into a puddle on your way to work in the pouring rain after forgetting\nyour umbrella at home. And instead of just walking into the caf\u00e9 you work at\nlike a normal person your hand slipped the doorknob and you walked, face first,\ninto the door. Of course, everyone saw, and you scurried quickly into the\nbackroom to change into your uniform. But that`s not the end of your misfortune\nthat day. Your day continued with finishing false orders, much to the annoyance\nof your customers. </p><p>Which brings you to this point of the day. You and your\nmanagers standing over a puddle of freshly made coffee and broken mugs on the\nfloor. Why are they on the floor? Because, surprise, you dropped them. </p><p><i>\u201cI`m really sorry,\u201d</i> you apologized, <i>\u201cI don`t know what`s\nwrong with me today.\u201d </i></p><p>You heard your manager sigh, her hands on her hips and shaking\nher head in disbelief. <i>\u201cSome days are like that, but maybe you should take off\nthe rest of the day and get a grip on yourself. Take a long weekend and come\nback on Monday as your, well working and not clumsy, self.\u201d </i>You looked at her\nabout to protest because you wanted to do good and work hard, but she cut you\noff. <i>\u201cYou know, before you break any more of our dishes.\u201d </i></p><p>At this you only nodded your head. She was right, maybe you\nneeded to accept this day as a disaster and do as much damage prevention as you\ncould. You changed back into your own clothes and said your goodbyes to your\nco-workers and manager before leaving through the backdoor. Once outside you\nleaned your back against the door, a heavy sigh leaving your mouth. <i>\u201cWell\nthat`s just great now isn\u2019t it.\u201d</i> You said out loud to yourself. You had just\nstarted to relax a little when you heard the sound of something metallic\nhitting the concrete ground. Standing up straight your head whipped to the\ndirection the sound had come from. </p><p>You lived in a big city and from what you heard through the\nnews small streets, like the one you are standing on right now, are the perfect\nplaces for robberies. Or maybe even worse, murder. Your eyes flew around the\nstreet frantically and you saw\u2026 Nothing. Nothing but a few trashcans and\ncardboard boxes in which the caf\u00e9 got their paper cups. You shook your head,\nmentally snorting at your dramatization of the situation. Then suddenly you\nheard more sounds. This time it was rustling. </p><p>Someone, or something, was definitely in this street with\nyou and you weren`t going to wait around for it to jump out and possibly\nmurdering you. As you turn around and start walking down the other direction of\nthe sound you heard something that could be mistaken for low meowing. You\nstopped in your tracks as it could be heard again, and this time you were sure\nthat it was meowing you heard. The sight that met you when you turned around\nbroke your heart.</p><p>There on the ground a good 15 meters from you was a small\nblack cat. It`s fur was dirty, a few spots looked to be glued together from\nsome sort of translucent liquid and it was littered in small scars. One of the\nscars caught your eye especially as it was much larger than the others. On one\nof its front paws is a big scar which looks like it`s still bleeding. Dirt of\nsome sort has already started to accumulate in it and you were sure that if it\ngoes untreated it would get infected. It must have been hurt recently and your\nmind raced with questions of what kind of human being would just leave a little\ncat like that alone on the street, not to mention one that is in such bad\nhealth conditions. </p><p>Slowly you make your way over to the little cat, being\ncareful not to scare it. When you`re a few meters from it, it looks at you\nsuspiciously, slightly hissing as you set down your bag and look for some kind\nof paper or fresh cloth to stop the bleeding. While you`re busy going through the\ncontents of your bag, the cat slowly approaches it. When you look back up you\nsee how it`s sniffing out the straps of your bag. It looks like it`s searching\nfor something and you can only guess that it`s food, as the cat looks severely malnutritioned.\n</p><p>You try to stretch out your hand slowly to pet the cat, but\nit quickly hisses and tries to run away. However, with the injury on it`s paw\nit doesn`t get far before stopping, giving out a painful cry which breaks your\nheart a second time. \u201cShh, shh, it`s okey. I`m not going to hurt you.\u201d You try\ntalking to it, hoping it can sense your sincerity. It looks at you quickly\nbefore laying down into the shape of a fluffy ball. You try again coming\ncloser, this time even more careful than before, trying hard not to make any\nsudden movement or loud sound.</p><p>And this time, as you reach your hand out, it doesn`t run\naway. It`s probably very tired and too hurt to try anything anymore. Your hand\ngently pets it`s fur in a try to show your good intentions. Being closer now\nyou can see that it`s not wearing a collar. <i>\u201cYou don`t have a home?\u201d</i> Your rhetorical\nquestion serving more as a realization for you. Your eyes lower and focus back\non the wound on it`s paw that was now slightly tucked under and protected by\nthe other.<i> \u201cWill you let me look at that?\u201d</i> You were met with the cat\u2019s bright\nblue eyes as it lifts it`s head, curiously following your hands while you reach\nfor the small cloth you had found in your bag earlier. </p><p>By now you are extremely careful, afraid to make the cat\nscared and hurt itself even more. Surprisingly when you grab it`s paw and tie\nthe cloth around it, the cat did not do anything to protest. In fact, the only\nthing that makes it obvious that it doesn`t trust you 100% is the hawk like\nlook following your every move and small, almost inaudible, hisses. \u201c<i>There.\u201d</i>\nYou say when you finish your little first aid act. <i>\u201cThis will protect your paw\nfor a little while.\u201d </i></p><p>Now for the hard part. You`ve already decided that you\ncouldn`t leave the cat outside here alone, left to it`s own devices. But you\ncouldn`t just force it to come with you either. In the end, it might end up\ndestroying your apartment if it doesn`t want to be there. Despite those fears\nyou decided that, even if it may cause some damage, as hurt as it is right now\nthere is no way it`s going to survive long in this city. So with as much\nconfidence as you could muster up you quickly scoped up the cat into your arms,\ntrying to hold it in a way to not drop it, however also not to crush it`s paw. And\nas you expected it started squirming, causing you to almost drop it.<i> \u201cNo, no,\nplease, I`m just trying to help you. You can`t just stay on the street when you`re\nhurt.\u201d</i> you try to reason with it, even though it can`t understand you. It seemed\nto work the other times and luckily it did so this time too. The cat calmed\ndown and you were able to get your bag and make your way back to your apartment.</p><p>On your way home you remembered how it doesn`t have a collar. Does that mean it`s nameless? How sad not to have a name, you thought.\u00a0<i>\u201cWe will have to figure out a name for you, hm?\u201d</i> You said looking down at it. It`s eyes boring into your own. It was undeniably cute and suddenly it was like someone put a light bulb over your head.</p><p><i>\u201cLet`s call you Suga.\u201d\u00a0</i><br/></p><p><i><b>To be continued&hellip;</b></i></p>",

From the moment you woke up today\nit`s been nothing but bad luck, clumsiness and people being annoyed. First your\nfavorite mug broke when you managed to throw it from the counter. Then you\nstepped into a puddle on your way to work in the pouring rain after forgetting\nyour umbrella at home. And instead of just walking into the caf\u00e9 you work at\nlike a normal person your hand slipped the doorknob and you walked, face first,\ninto the door. Of course, everyone saw, and you scurried quickly into the\nbackroom to change into your uniform. But that`s not the end of your misfortune\nthat day. Your day continued with finishing false orders, much to the annoyance\nof your customers. </p><p>Which brings you to this point of the day. You and your\nmanagers standing over a puddle of freshly made coffee and broken mugs on the\nfloor. Why are they on the floor? Because, surprise, you dropped them. </p><p><i>\u201cI`m really sorry,\u201d</i> you apologized, <i>\u201cI don`t know what`s\nwrong with me today.\u201d </i></p><p>You heard your manager sigh, her hands on her hips and shaking\nher head in disbelief. <i>\u201cSome days are like that, but maybe you should take off\nthe rest of the day and get a grip on yourself. Take a long weekend and come\nback on Monday as your, well working and not clumsy, self.\u201d </i>You looked at her\nabout to protest because you wanted to do good and work hard, but she cut you\noff. <i>\u201cYou know, before you break any more of our dishes.\u201d </i></p><p>At this you only nodded your head. She was right, maybe you\nneeded to accept this day as a disaster and do as much damage prevention as you\ncould. You changed back into your own clothes and said your goodbyes to your\nco-workers and manager before leaving through the backdoor. Once outside you\nleaned your back against the door, a heavy sigh leaving your mouth. <i>\u201cWell\nthat`s just great now isn\u2019t it.\u201d</i> You said out loud to yourself. You had just\nstarted to relax a little when you heard the sound of something metallic\nhitting the concrete ground. Standing up straight your head whipped to the\ndirection the sound had come from. </p><p>You lived in a big city and from what you heard through the\nnews small streets, like the one you are standing on right now, are the perfect\nplaces for robberies. Or maybe even worse, murder. Your eyes flew around the\nstreet frantically and you saw\u2026 Nothing. Nothing but a few trashcans and\ncardboard boxes in which the caf\u00e9 got their paper cups. You shook your head,\nmentally snorting at your dramatization of the situation. Then suddenly you\nheard more sounds. This time it was rustling. </p><p>Someone, or something, was definitely in this street with\nyou and you weren`t going to wait around for it to jump out and possibly\nmurdering you. As you turn around and start walking down the other direction of\nthe sound you heard something that could be mistaken for low meowing. You\nstopped in your tracks as it could be heard again, and this time you were sure\nthat it was meowing you heard. The sight that met you when you turned around\nbroke your heart.</p><p>There on the ground a good 15 meters from you was a small\nblack cat. It`s fur was dirty, a few spots looked to be glued together from\nsome sort of translucent liquid and it was littered in small scars. One of the\nscars caught your eye especially as it was much larger than the others. On one\nof its front paws is a big scar which looks like it`s still bleeding. Dirt of\nsome sort has already started to accumulate in it and you were sure that if it\ngoes untreated it would get infected. It must have been hurt recently and your\nmind raced with questions of what kind of human being would just leave a little\ncat like that alone on the street, not to mention one that is in such bad\nhealth conditions. </p><p>Slowly you make your way over to the little cat, being\ncareful not to scare it. When you`re a few meters from it, it looks at you\nsuspiciously, slightly hissing as you set down your bag and look for some kind\nof paper or fresh cloth to stop the bleeding. While you`re busy going through the\ncontents of your bag, the cat slowly approaches it. When you look back up you\nsee how it`s sniffing out the straps of your bag. It looks like it`s searching\nfor something and you can only guess that it`s food, as the cat looks severely malnutritioned.\n</p><p>You try to stretch out your hand slowly to pet the cat, but\nit quickly hisses and tries to run away. However, with the injury on it`s paw\nit doesn`t get far before stopping, giving out a painful cry which breaks your\nheart a second time. \u201cShh, shh, it`s okey. I`m not going to hurt you.\u201d You try\ntalking to it, hoping it can sense your sincerity. It looks at you quickly\nbefore laying down into the shape of a fluffy ball. You try again coming\ncloser, this time even more careful than before, trying hard not to make any\nsudden movement or loud sound.</p><p>And this time, as you reach your hand out, it doesn`t run\naway. It`s probably very tired and too hurt to try anything anymore. Your hand\ngently pets it`s fur in a try to show your good intentions. Being closer now\nyou can see that it`s not wearing a collar. <i>\u201cYou don`t have a home?\u201d</i> Your rhetorical\nquestion serving more as a realization for you. Your eyes lower and focus back\non the wound on it`s paw that was now slightly tucked under and protected by\nthe other.<i> \u201cWill you let me look at that?\u201d</i> You were met with the cat\u2019s bright\nblue eyes as it lifts it`s head, curiously following your hands while you reach\nfor the small cloth you had found in your bag earlier. </p><p>By now you are extremely careful, afraid to make the cat\nscared and hurt itself even more. Surprisingly when you grab it`s paw and tie\nthe cloth around it, the cat did not do anything to protest. In fact, the only\nthing that makes it obvious that it doesn`t trust you 100% is the hawk like\nlook following your every move and small, almost inaudible, hisses. \u201c<i>There.\u201d</i>\nYou say when you finish your little first aid act. <i>\u201cThis will protect your paw\nfor a little while.\u201d </i></p><p>Now for the hard part. You`ve already decided that you\ncouldn`t leave the cat outside here alone, left to it`s own devices. But you\ncouldn`t just force it to come with you either. In the end, it might end up\ndestroying your apartment if it doesn`t want to be there. Despite those fears\nyou decided that, even if it may cause some damage, as hurt as it is right now\nthere is no way it`s going to survive long in this city. So with as much\nconfidence as you could muster up you quickly scoped up the cat into your arms,\ntrying to hold it in a way to not drop it, however also not to crush it`s paw. And\nas you expected it started squirming, causing you to almost drop it.<i> \u201cNo, no,\nplease, I`m just trying to help you. You can`t just stay on the street when you`re\nhurt.\u201d</i> you try to reason with it, even though it can`t understand you. It seemed\nto work the other times and luckily it did so this time too. The cat calmed\ndown and you were able to get your bag and make your way back to your apartment.</p><p>On your way home you remembered how it doesn`t have a collar. Does that mean it`s nameless? How sad not to have a name, you thought.\u00a0<i>\u201cWe will have to figure out a name for you, hm?\u201d</i> You said looking down at it. It`s eyes boring into your own. It was undeniably cute and suddenly it was like someone put a light bulb over your head.</p><p><i>\u201cLet`s call you Suga.\u201d\u00a0</i><br></p><p><i><b>To be continued\u2026</b></i></p>",

One last package to deliver and then you were free to go home but it wasn\u2019t your plan to find Jungkook, your childhood friend, at the place of the delivery.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"285\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/06394560690fa01b2647177838082570/tumblr_inline_pnp8wk5G3I1tjtdks_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"285\"/></figure><p>The world you are about to imagine yourself in is different. Different and selfish.</p><p>Eternal smiles by the morning while the fear fades through the night. All of that because of these <i>Daleus. </i>They say how dreadful and parlous they are without evidencing a single suspicious case in the last 10 years.</p><p>Of course we take advantage of the poor creatures and blame them with our crimes.</p><!-- more --><p>As much guilt I feel, I still try not to get out at night, wear revealing clothes or stay in a relationship to long. They warn us about how similar they are to us and how bad they can be<i>. Bullshit.</i></p><p><i>\u201cThey say. They say so much and do so less. Don\u2019t you think Y/N?\u201d</i></p><p>You didn\u2019t fell asleep due to the loud exhauster right at the level of your eyes, but there you were, with a big spoon while the water started to boil.</p><p><i>\u201cY/N, look at the mess you are making</i>\u201d you felt a little push to your right by your mom what almost made you collapsed from fag.</p><p>You and your mom were waiting for your uncles and his creepy son. You saw them once in a year but they moved really close to us so my mom had the brilliant idea to invite them to dinner in my first official day of summer holidays.</p><p><i>\u201cSorry what were you saying?\u201d </i>you sat in one of the kitchen chairs while looking to your mom.</p><p><i>\u201cThey are talking about Daleus on the news.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Possible attack by Daleus down the 47 Avenue. Please be aware of the danger of these creatures and stay indoors if possible.</i></p><p>47 wasn\u2019t that far from your house but you didn\u2019t intend to leave do warmness of your house. Not today Daleus.</p><p><i>\u201cI hope your dad and your sister are alright.\u201d </i>You felt the fear in your moms voice. That fear everyone felt while laying in their bed ready for a good night of sleep.</p><p>Your mom was never afraid of them, she\u2019s just scared of the world. You were too. You were so scared you fear your life. <i>Bullshit again.</i></p><p>They wish you were. You were a little <i>\u201cI don\u2019t give a fuck about you\u201d </i>persona so none of that was a bother. You just didn\u2019t give a fuck at all.</p><p><i>\u201cThey\u2019ll be fine. I promise\u201d</i> you got closer and placed a hand over her shoulder.</p><p>You couldn\u2019t promise a thing but still you did because you hated that tone of her.</p><p><i>\u201cThey are here!\u201d </i>my mom felt relieved when her eyes met that dark blue car parking in front of our eyes. <i>\u201cGo see if the table is set correctly.\u201d</i></p><p>It looked like it. The napkins were folded, the plates were clean, the candles were burning and the glasses were polished. Everything looked so bright and happy.</p><p>Your family was the absolute opposite.</p><p>It was almost like hell inside there. Your parents weren\u2019t the same neither their relationship, your sister was far from you and the only relaxing moments you had in that house were replaced by stupid fights from your parents or the loud music from your neighbor.</p><p>Still you gather yourself up, applied a quick layer of lipstick, passed your fingers through your hair in attempt to make it more presentable and smiled at yourself.</p><p><i>It will be just a couple of hours and you will be sleeping in your bed.</i> You promised to yourself. Again you couldn\u2019t promise a thing but still you did.</p><p>\u201cY/N, come here\u201d your mom shouted from the front door.</p><p>You checked yourself one last time and walked to them.</p><p>You were wearing a big and comfy grey sweat which hides your hands due to the long sleeves, a light blue jean and a pair of white high <i>converse</i>.</p><p>You hugged your uncles and introduced yourself to the son. You remember him from 3 years ago, but his name?</p><p>Your mom knew you weren\u2019t the best to remember phone numbers, birthday dates or the simplest home work so she remembered you each one of them to you (while trying to) showing you a picture of the latest dinners.</p><p>It sounds like a cereal, you knew that for sure.</p><p>Jankook? Jeonkook? Jinkook? No, fuck. It\u2019s different.</p><p>Ah.</p><p><i>Jungkook.</i></p><p>You got it Y/N.</p><p><i>\u201cYes?\u201d</i></p><p>Well, you are now fucked. Why would you say it that out loud?</p><p>Jungkook was distracted by my mom\u2019s conversation when the sound of your voice topped every single one voice in the hallway. He faced you after a couple of seconds.</p><p><i>\u201cI-I-I missed you.\u201d </i>What? What did you say?</p><p>You knew you fucked up when your own sister looks at you with that \u201cwhat the fuck\u201d face.</p><p><i>\u201cI literally pulled your hair last time I was here.\u201d</i></p><p>You remember your mom\u2019s words. He did pull your hair last time. You now remember that you hate him.</p><p><i>\u201cOh yeah, THAT. I already forgotten about it.\u201d</i> Your face burned in shame while your sister did nothing but laugh at your face.</p><p>You didn\u2019t miss Jungkook at all, but you did remember the afternoons you spend arguing about how your dog is better than his, (what still remains true).</p><p>Jungkook was different, we painted his hair black and got his ears pierced, but even 3 years after, he stayed that beautiful and almost shy persona.</p><p>\u201cShall we eat? I don\u2019t want you all eating cold lasagna.\u201d Everyone nod, passing by you at last Jungkook, stopping right in front of you.</p><p>\u201cSince when do you even like me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the thing. I don\u2019t. But I can\u2019t just say I hate you in front of your parents so \u201cI missed you\u201d has the best thing I could find.\u201d</p><p>Everyone could agree that you were a great liar.</p><p>He let out a small \u201cok\u201d and stepped into the kitchen.</p><p>You never felt so proud of yourself. Getting out of embarrassing situations was not your forte but that was amazing.</p><p>But look at you now. Life is different with Jungkook now. You actually like him. Just a bit.</p><p>~</p><p>It was your free day. You got up around 12 pm and you were feeling amazing.</p><p><b><i>12 messages unread from Jungkook.</i></b></p><p><i>cute asshole: Y/N, good morninggggggg</i></p><p><i>cute asshole: lets do something today</i></p><p><i>cute asshole: i cant stay a lot of time but still</i></p><p><i>cute asshole: i can take you to that restaurant down town</i></p><p><i>cute asshole: the one Lee already took you</i></p><p><i>cute asshole: lets eat there</i></p><p><i>cute asshole: i want to spend more time with you</i></p><p><i>cute asshole: lets eat ok?</i></p><p><i>cute asshole: im already hungry</i></p><p><i>cute asshole: be ready at 1 pm</i></p><p><i>cute asshole: im finally seeing that ugly face of yours</i></p><p><i>cute asshole:y/n? please tell me you are already getting ready please</i></p><p><i>Fuck.</i></p><p>You jumped out from bed and looked in the mirror. You took a shower, while singing to every <i>Ariana Grande</i> song you could remember and losing track of time.</p><p><i>cute asshole: i really hope you are ready</i></p><p><i>You were in love with Jungkook</i>. That was for sure. You knew it since the day you woke up by his side in some random house that turned out to be his. \u00a0</p><p>You got so but so drunk that night at Lee\u2019s house that you still can\u2019t remember what happened.</p><p><b><i>2 month ago</i></b></p><p>- Good morning pretty.</p><p>You respond with a small and deep good morning while turning to the other side of the bed. You opened your eyes and there he has. With his little and puffy eyes, and red lips looking straight to you, searching for some warning symptoms you could send.</p><p>You really thought you were dreaming. Nothing of that felt real, maybe the alcohol has still in your veins, and so you decided to sleep more. Giving up on that dream of waking up next to Jungkook.</p><p>\u201cNo more sleeping today pretty. It\u2019s already 3. I already sent your mom a text.\u201d</p><p><i>Yup. Like this is even real.</i></p><p>\u201cYou think I\u2019m kidding, y/n? Don\u2019t make me throw you out from the window.\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cDo it.\u201d</i></p><p>Loose hands were around your waist while you question yourself about being 3 am or 3 pm, and then you felt that cold breeze in your body. You opened your eyes and you were literally out of the window only secure by one of Jungkook\u2019s arms.</p><p>\u201c<i>Jungkook, Jungkook, fuck, Jungkook</i>, I\u2019m afraid of heights.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh fuck.\u201d</p><p>In one push he pulled you to his embrace falling slowly on the ground, listening to your deep breaths. You rested your head on his chest, trembling from fear while he grabs your hands to keep contact. You were full of fear and Jungkook full of worry.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, okay? I\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, don\u2019t, yeah, don\u2019t worry, no problem.\u201d your voice sounded like a whisper.</p><p>You calmed down and Jungkook stayed with you the rest of day even though you insisted that it was fine and you could finally go home.

They warn us about how similar they are to us and how bad they can be<i>. Bullshit.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;They say. They say so much and do so less. Don&rsquo;t you think Y/N?&rdquo;</i></p><p>You didn&rsquo;t fell asleep due to the loud exhauster right at the level of your eyes, but there you were, with a big spoon while the water started to boil.</p><p><i>&ldquo;Y/N, look at the mess you are making</i>&rdquo; you felt a little push to your right by your mom what almost made you collapsed from fag.</p><p>You and your mom were waiting for your uncles and his creepy son. You saw them once in a year but they moved really close to us so my mom had the brilliant idea to invite them to dinner in my first official day of summer holidays.</p><p><i>&ldquo;Sorry what were you saying?&rdquo; </i>you sat in one of the kitchen chairs while looking to your mom.</p><p><i>&ldquo;They are talking about Daleus on the news.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Possible attack by Daleus down the 47 Avenue. Please be aware of the danger of these creatures and stay indoors if possible.</i></p><p>47 wasn&rsquo;t that far from your house but you didn&rsquo;t intend to leave do warmness of your house. Not today Daleus.</p><p><i>&ldquo;I hope your dad and your sister are alright.&rdquo; </i>You felt the fear in your moms voice. That fear everyone felt while laying in their bed ready for a good night of sleep.</p><p>Your mom was never afraid of them, she&rsquo;s just scared of the world. You were too. You were so scared you fear your life. <i>Bullshit again.</i></p><p>They wish you were. You were a little <i>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t give a fuck about you&rdquo; </i>persona so none of that was a bother. You just didn&rsquo;t give a fuck at all.</p><p><i>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll be fine. I promise&rdquo;</i> you got closer and placed a hand over her shoulder.</p><p>You couldn&rsquo;t promise a thing but still you did because you hated that tone of her.</p><p><i>&ldquo;They are here!&rdquo; </i>my mom felt relieved when her eyes met that dark blue car parking in front of our eyes. <i>&ldquo;Go see if the table is set correctly.&rdquo;</i></p><p>It looked like it. The napkins were folded, the plates were clean, the candles were burning and the glasses were polished. Everything looked so bright and happy.</p><p>Your family was the absolute opposite.</p><p>It was almost like hell inside there. Your parents weren&rsquo;t the same neither their relationship, your sister was far from you and the only relaxing moments you had in that house were replaced by stupid fights from your parents or the loud music from your neighbor.</p><p>Still you gather yourself up, applied a quick layer of lipstick, passed your fingers through your hair in attempt to make it more presentable and smiled at yourself.</p><p><i>It will be just a couple of hours and you will be sleeping in your bed.</i> You promised to yourself. Again you couldn&rsquo;t promise a thing but still you did.</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N, come here&rdquo; your mom shouted from the front door.</p><p>You checked yourself one last time and walked to them.</p><p>You were wearing a big and comfy grey sweat which hides your hands due to the long sleeves, a light blue jean and a pair of white high <i>converse</i>.</p><p>You hugged your uncles and introduced yourself to the son. You remember him from 3 years ago, but his name?</p><p>Your mom knew you weren&rsquo;t the best to remember phone numbers, birthday dates or the simplest home work so she remembered you each one of them to you (while trying to) showing you a picture of the latest dinners.</p><p>It sounds like a cereal, you knew that for sure.</p><p>Jankook? Jeonkook? Jinkook? No, fuck. It&rsquo;s different.</p><p>Ah.</p><p><i>Jungkook.</i></p><p>You got it Y/N.</p><p><i>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</i></p><p>Well, you are now fucked. Why would you say it that out loud?</p><p>Jungkook was distracted by my mom&rsquo;s conversation when the sound of your voice topped every single one voice in the hallway. He faced you after a couple of seconds.</p><p><i>&ldquo;I-I-I missed you.&rdquo; </i>What? What did you say?</p><p>You knew you fucked up when your own sister looks at you with that &ldquo;what the fuck&rdquo; face.</p><p><i>&ldquo;I literally pulled your hair last time I was here.&rdquo;</i></p><p>You remember your mom&rsquo;s words. He did pull your hair last time. You now remember that you hate him.</p><p><i>&ldquo;Oh yeah, THAT. I already forgotten about it.&rdquo;</i> Your face burned in shame while your sister did nothing but laugh at your face.</p><p>You didn&rsquo;t miss Jungkook at all, but you did remember the afternoons you spend arguing about how your dog is better than his, (what still remains true).</p><p>Jungkook was different, we painted his hair black and got his ears pierced, but even 3 years after, he stayed that beautiful and almost shy persona.</p><p>&ldquo;Shall we eat? I don&rsquo;t want you all eating cold lasagna.&rdquo; Everyone nod, passing by you at last Jungkook, stopping right in front of you.</p><p>&ldquo;Since when do you even like me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the thing. I don&rsquo;t. But I can&rsquo;t just say I hate you in front of your parents so &ldquo;I missed you&rdquo; has the best thing I could find.&rdquo;</p><p>Everyone could agree that you were a great liar.</p><p>He let out a small &ldquo;ok&rdquo; and stepped into the kitchen.</p><p>You never felt so proud of yourself. Getting out of embarrassing situations was not your forte but that was amazing.</p><p>But look at you now. Life is different with Jungkook now. You actually like him. Just a bit.</p><p>~</p><p>It was your free day. You got up around 12 pm and you were feeling amazing.</p><p><b><i>12 messages unread from Jungkook.</i></b></p><p><i>cute asshole: Y/N, good morninggggggg</i></p><p><i>cute asshole: lets do something today</i></p><p><i>cute asshole: i cant stay a lot of time but still</i></p><p><i>cute asshole: i can take you to that restaurant down town</i></p><p><i>cute asshole: the one Lee already took you</i></p><p><i>cute asshole: lets eat there</i></p><p><i>cute asshole: i want to spend more time with you</i></p><p><i>cute asshole: lets eat ok?</i></p><p><i>cute asshole: im already hungry</i></p><p><i>cute asshole: be ready at 1 pm</i></p><p><i>cute asshole: im finally seeing that ugly face of yours</i></p><p><i>cute asshole:y/n? please tell me you are already getting ready please</i></p><p><i>Fuck.</i></p><p>You jumped out from bed and looked in the mirror. You took a shower, while singing to every <i>Ariana Grande</i> song you could remember and losing track of time.</p><p><i>cute asshole: i really hope you are ready</i></p><p><i>You were in love with Jungkook</i>. That was for sure. You knew it since the day you woke up by his side in some random house that turned out to be his. &nbsp;</p><p>You got so but so drunk that night at Lee&rsquo;s house that you still can&rsquo;t remember what happened.</p><p><b><i>2 month ago</i></b></p><p>- Good morning pretty.</p><p>You respond with a small and deep good morning while turning to the other side of the bed. You opened your eyes and there he has. With his little and puffy eyes, and red lips looking straight to you, searching for some warning symptoms you could send.</p><p>You really thought you were dreaming. Nothing of that felt real, maybe the alcohol has still in your veins, and so you decided to sleep more. Giving up on that dream of waking up next to Jungkook.</p><p>&ldquo;No more sleeping today pretty. It&rsquo;s already 3. I already sent your mom a text.&rdquo;</p><p><i>Yup. Like this is even real.</i></p><p>&ldquo;You think I&rsquo;m kidding, y/n? Don&rsquo;t make me throw you out from the window.&rdquo;</p><p><i>&ldquo;Do it.&rdquo;</i></p><p>Loose hands were around your waist while you question yourself about being 3 am or 3 pm, and then you felt that cold breeze in your body. You opened your eyes and you were literally out of the window only secure by one of Jungkook&rsquo;s arms.</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Jungkook, Jungkook, fuck, Jungkook</i>, I&rsquo;m afraid of heights.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh fuck.&rdquo;</p><p>In one push he pulled you to his embrace falling slowly on the ground, listening to your deep breaths. You rested your head on his chest, trembling from fear while he grabs your hands to keep contact. You were full of fear and Jungkook full of worry.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, okay? I&rsquo;m sorry, I didn&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, don&rsquo;t, yeah, don&rsquo;t worry, no problem.&rdquo; your voice sounded like a whisper.</p><p>You calmed down and Jungkook stayed with you the rest of day even though you insisted that it was fine and you could finally go home. The same guy who destroyed your favorite toy when you were 5, holds you now in your deepest fears.</p><p><i>Life is fucking ironic.</i></p><p><i>Part 3</i></p></p>",

Taking a deep breath in, you followed as well. When you walked in you could see all of the guys glaring at your boyfriend with distaste, tension strong in the air. Yet, as soon as you came into their line of sight, the glares softened, smiles gracing their faces, the air feeling light and happy once again. You nervously smiled back as you stood in between Yuna and Hyuk. Your boyfriend took your hand and the boys all lowly growled and glared at your joined hands. For some strange reason you didn\u2019t want to make them angry. You could pass it off as not wanting to offend them, but you knew you were just insecure of what they thought. So, not wanting to anger them any further, you tried to pull your hand out of Hyuk\u2019s grasp. Though this proved to be difficult as he just kept tightening his grip.</p><p>You cleared your throat, trying to lighten the mood, \u201cHi.\u201d The sound of your voice seemed to calm the stiff hybrids. </p><p>The golden retriever, who you remember him introducing himself as \u2018Hobi\u2019 stepped forward. \u201cHello!\u201d he said brightly, his tail wagging back and forth in excitement. It was cute how excited he got when meeting new people and you couldn\u2019t help but to giggle. His ears twitched and his eyes lit up when he heard it.</p><p>\n\n\u201cHello, thank you for coming back here,\u201d Namjoon said as he held his hand out to you. Shaking his hand, you smiled politely. As you let go of his hand, his smile somewhat left his face but he was quick to make it return before you could notice.\u00a0</p><!-- more --><p><b></b></p><p>Jin grabbed your hand and kissed the back of it, \u201cHello again beautiful.\u201d You could feel your cheeks burning as your eyes widened. Hearing Hyuk scoff, you were reminded of his presence and coughed awkwardly. Feeling his hold on your hand tighten, you glanced at him and saw him glaring with a frown on his face. Feelings of guilt slowly built up inside of you. Here you were allowing some guy to flirt with you in front of your boyfriend.</p><p>Namjoon cleared his throat, gesturing to the two couches in the corner of the room, \u201cWhy don\u2019t we sit?\u201d</p><p>The three of you followed behind them. You let go of your boyfriend\u2019s hand and sat down in the middle. Hyuk was about to sit by you, but Jimin beat him to it with Taehyung sitting on your other side. You looked apologetically to Hyuk as he huffed and sat on the other couch. Hoseok sat in front of you, leaning back on your legs. Jin sat on the other side of Taehyung with Jungkook choosing to sit by Jimin. The two remaining boys, Yoongi and Namjoon, sat on the floor either side of Hoseok. You knew without even looking that Hyuk was glaring at them all.</p><p>\u201cWould you like me to sit by you baby?\u201d you asked him as you went to get up. Having all of them sitting so close to you was becoming a little too overwhelming. Before you could fully stand, Jimin wrapped his tail around your waist and Taehyung put his arm around your shoulders\u00a0while the rest of the boys growled.</p><p>Hyuk raised an eyebrow, \u201cActually yeah, I would like it if my <i>girlfriend </i>would come sit by me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAunt Y/n? Where can I sit?\u201d Yuna quietly ask you before a fight could break out. You were grateful she said something because you knew how bad Hyuk\u2019s anger could get and you also knew hybrids had intense instincts.</p><p>Before you could answer her, Jimin held his arms out to her, \u201cYou can sit on my lap cutie!\u201d You heart skipped a beat as you saw him pull her onto his lap. He looked so adorable interacting with her. Yuna smiled big as she looked at him with admiration. He was her favorite after all.</p><p>\u201cCan I pet your ears?\u201d Yuna\u2019s question brought you out of your thoughts.</p><p>Your eyes widened, \u201cYuna! You can\u2019t just ask that!\u201d You turned to Jimin as you apologized, \u201cI\u2019m so sorry Jimin-ssi.\u201d He just smiled at you and allowed Yuna to pet his ears. You smiled as he started purring, the sound relaxing you further.</p><p>Everyone broke off into their separate conversations. Jimin and Jungkook were talking to Yuna, while Namjoon and Hoseok were quietly whispering to each other, glancing at Hyuk every once in a while, and Yoongi was just sitting there silently. As you were talking to Jin and Taehyung, you could feel someone\u2019s eyes on you. Thinking it was Hyuk, you looked at him only to find out he was on his phone. Tilting your head to the side, you looked around the room to see who it was. Your breath hitched as soon as you made eye contact with Yoongi. His gaze held so much pain and regret that you had to avert your eyes. He let out a whimper and the noise caused everyone to look at the two of you.</p><p>\u201cJagi..\u201d Yoongi\u2019s voice was quiet and he timidly put his hand on your knee. He let out another whimper when you flinched away from him. When tears gathered in his eyes, Hoseok put his arm around him.</p><p>Hyuk cleared his throat and crossed his arms, \u201cI\u2019d like if you wouldn\u2019t call her Jagi. Only I can do that. Besides, she\u2019s <i>afraid</i> of you. Don\u2019t you remember?\u201d A smirk was present on his face as he looked Yoongi in the eyes. You couldn\u2019t believe what you were hearing. You knew Yoongi felt bad about what had happened and it angered you that Hyuk was being so inconsiderate. \n\n</p><p><b></b></p><p>You expected Yoongi to retaliate and start a fight, but were shocked to see him only tense up before leaving the room quickly, his tail wrapped around his waist and his ears down. It was strange to see him looking so vulnerable. Yuna had told you how he acts like he doesn\u2019t care, but you could also remember him saying how much of a softie he was. You were brought out of your thoughts when Hoseok follow him, sending a heated glare in your boyfriend\u2019s direction. For some strange reason, you felt your chest hurt when they left. Rubbing your chest lightly, you looked back to the rest of the group. The BTS members that remained looked at you knowingly. You were about to ask if Yoongi would be okay, but Hyuk spoke up.</p><p>\u201cIs he always such a baby?\u201d he snorted and smugly looked at the guys. They all growled at him, their tails swaying in anger, their eyes staring daggers at him.</p><p>Surprisingly it was Jungkook who spoke up, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you shut the fuck up?</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you make me <i>bunny</i>,\u201d Hyuk spat out at Jungkook and sniggered when all he did was take a deep breath and turn around. He chuckled at Jungkook\u2019s back, \u201cThat\u2019s what I thought. Poor little shy bunny can\u2019t do shi-\u201d He was cut off by Jungkook\u2019s fist hitting his jaw. You gasped and covered your mouth as Jungkook fell on top of him, continuing to land punches on his face. Yuna started yelling and crying as the boys grabbed a hold of him and hauled him off of your boyfriend.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d you asked as you ran over and helped him up off the floor. Yuna followed behind you and grabbed your hand tightly. Just then, Yoongi and Hoseok walked through the door into the room. The frigid atmosphere made them stop in their tracks and become on guard. Their sharp eyes quickly looked around the room to see what happened.</p><p>Hoseok was the one to break the stressful silence, \u201cUh what happened here?\u201d No one uttered a single word, making you bit your lip anxiously. God, you didn\u2019t know what you would do if they all started fighting again. You especially didn\u2019t know how to feel now that Yoongi was back. On one hand you were excited he came back, but on the other hand you were slightly afraid. Yet somewhere deep down inside of you, you knew he would never intentionally hurt you.</p><p>Hyuk wiped his lip, looking up at Jungkook straight in the eyes, \u201cYou\u2019re lucky you\u2019re in some famous band or else you\u2019d be <i>dead</i>.\u201d Your eyes became wide as you stared at him in disbelief. Was he stupid? Why was he threatening a famous person? A <i>hybrid </i>at that!</p><p>\n\n\u201cY/n, why don\u2019t you take Yuna and go buy some merch? It\u2019s on us,\u201d Namjoon said as he waved over a security guard proceeding to tell him something all the while keeping his eyes locked on Hyuk. Said security guard nodded and led both you and Yuna out of the room. As soon as the door shut behind you, you could hear someone inside start yelling, other voices joining in. You could feel yourself start to panic, not wanting anyone to get hurt anymore.\n\n</p><p>Looking away from the door, you tightened your grip on Yuna\u2019s hand and followed the guard down a hallway. Once you guys got to the little store they had, you looked down at your niece, \u201cOkay Yuna, choose what you like and I\u2019ll get it for you sweetie.\u201d Yuna gasped and looked at you with shining eyes, excited to be able to get BTS merch. Like she always told you, you could never have too much.\n\n</p><p>\u201cMa\u2019am, Mr. Kim said he would pay for it. So you don\u2019t have to worry about money,\u201d the security guard said as he held up a shiny, silver card. From what he had said you could tell it was Namjoon\u2019s credit card. </p><p>You put your hands out in front of you, stuttering slightly with eyes opened wide in disbelief, \u201cOh! No thank you! I can pay for myself. He doesn\u2019t have to worry about paying for me haha..\u201d You trailed off as he tried to hand the credit card to you. Key word being tried as you quickly moved away from him. Walking over to where Yuna was looking at some t-shirts, you heard the man clear his throat. Pretending to not have heard him you stood next to your niece, \u201cSo Yuna Tuna, what have you thought of getting?\u201d </p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s so much I wanna get, but I don\u2019t want to waste your money and Appa only gave me \u20a950,000,\u201d Yuna pouted as she put the shirt back. In her arms she already held two shirts and a poster. You were about to reply, telling her she could get whatever and <i>you\u2019d </i>pay for it, but it seems like the security guard, who was starting to get on your nerves by the way, beat you to it. </p><p>He picked the t-shirt Yuna had previously put down back up and handed it to her, \u201cYou can get this Ms. Yuna. Rm-ssi said he\u2019d buy it for you.\u201d </p><p>Okay, now he was <i>really </i>getting on your nerves. You scoffed, rolling your eyes at the man. Why didn\u2019t he get the hint you could pay for it? Actually, why did Namjoon think you couldn\u2019t pay for it? Did he pity you?</p><p>Yuna gasped and grabbed the piece of clothing from his hands, smiling up at him and then at you. Seeing her so excited made you soften your tight stance. You could always pay Namjoon back. Granted it might take you a while, especially after seeing how much Yuna was getting. So far, she had six shirts, two different tote bags, a headband, and another one of their CD&rsquo;s.</p><p>&ldquo;Yuna, don&rsquo;t get too much okay? It&rsquo;s not nice to spend all of someone&rsquo;s money,&rdquo; you said as you followed behind her.</p><p>She looked back at you as she put everything on the counter to be checked out, &ldquo;But Namjoon said I could get anything.&rdquo; A pout was present on her face as the cashier rang up her merchandise.</p><p>&ldquo;I know he did sweetie, but it&rsquo;s still not polite to spend people&rsquo;s money. It&rsquo;s always a good thing to be independent and not rely on someone,&rdquo; you voiced as pulled your wallet out. Just because Namjoon said they would pay for it didn&rsquo;t mean you weren&rsquo;t going to try and pay for it yourself. You were a strong and independent woman after all.</p><p>As you and the little girl had a stare off, the cashier had finished ringing the items up and cleared their throat, &ldquo;That&rsquo;ll be \u20a9170,000 please.&rdquo; The security guard handed the lady the credit card before you could whip yours out.</p><p>Huffing, you crossed your arms, slightly pouting, not knowing the rest of the boys were standing behind you. Someone coughed, making you turn around in shock. As you turned around, you swore you heard one of the boys mumble out the word &lsquo;cute&rsquo;. You waved awkwardly, completely embarrassed they had seen your small act.</p><p>&ldquo;Namjoon-sii! Thank you for letting me get all of this merch!&rdquo; Yuna bowed and looked up at him in admiration. You could tell just by looking at her interact with them how much she admired them and the thought made your heart swell. She was too cute for her own good.</p><p>While Yuna was talking to the boys, showing them what she got in the process, you walked over to stand next to your angry boyfriend. You leaned over and whispered in his ear, &ldquo;Hey baby, how are you doing?&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n&ldquo;How am I doing? Really? Are you really asking me that right now?&rdquo; he scoffed, shaking his head and shifting away from you. He didn\u2019t understand how you could be so idiotic at times. Like right now, how you were just letting them talk about your relationship with him and not even say anything was making his temper rise to dangerous levels.\u00a0</p><p>Leaning away from him, you tried to hide the hurt shown on your face, &ldquo;I just wanted to make sure you were okay&hellip;\u201d </p><p>\u201cThis is why she shouldn\u2019t be dating you. You treat her like shit,\u201d Jungkook\u2019s broke into the conversation. Jimin brought Yuna over to look at some of the posters and you silently thanked him. You really didn\u2019t want her to hear them fight. <i>Again</i>. </p><p>Hyuk looked the bunny hybrid in the eyes, \u201cOh you really don\u2019t know when to shut your mouth bunny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you not to fucking call me that,\u201d Jungkook spat at Hyuk, the rest of the boys, excluding Yoongi, tried to calm him down. Yoongi was just staring at you intensely. </p><p>\u201cHyuk, you need to calm down,\u201d your voice was soft, trying to calm the agitated man. </p><p>He ripped his arm out of your grasp and shifted his glare to you, \u201cDo you not hear what they are saying right now Y/n? Are you really that fucking dumb?\u201d When all you could do was stare at him, he grew unnerved and raised his hand. You flinched, expecting to feel the sting, but was met with growling instead. There, stood in front of you, with Hyuk\u2019s wrist in his own hand, was Yoongi. Your heart skipped a beat. Yoongi. <i>He </i>stopped Hyuk from hitting you. </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you <i>dare </i>lay a hand on her or I\u2019ll fucking break both of your hands,\u201d Yoongi\u2019s words were low, a threatening growl in the back of his throat. Your boyfriend went to raise his other hand, but was stopped by Hoseok grabbing it. </p><p>You walked around both Yoongi and Hoseok, voice quiet and a slight tremble to it, \u201cI think it\u2019d be best if we left. Thank you for allowing us backstage to hang out and thank you for buying Yuna things. I greatly appreciate it.\u201d Finishing your words, you bowed low and called Yuna over. </p><p>\u201cWait, Y/n, can we at least get your phone number? We want to hang out some more&hellip;\u201d Jimin trailed off as he saw the look Hyuk was giving him. Saying yes meant you would disappoint your boyfriend&hellip;but saying no meant you\u2019d be hurting <i>seven </i>people. And you know what they say, majority always wins.</p><p>Glancing between both boys, you made up your mind, \u201cOf course you can Jimin-ssi.\u201d Hyuk\u2019s head snapped towards you, but you ignored it. It wasn\u2019t technically your fault. He was the one who got in a fight with them. Not you.\u00a0Plus, you felt this certain pull making you want to get to know them even more. \n\n</p><p>Grabbing Jimin\u2019s phone, you typed in your number then handed it back to him. A few seconds later and your phone buzzed in your back pocket. You thought better and decided to take a look at it when Hyuk was asleep. Bidding them goodbye, you left behind Hyuk with Yuna\u2019s hand in your own. She happily skipped next to you, her purchases in her unoccupied hand.</p><p>&ndash;0&ndash;0&ndash;0&ndash;0&ndash;</p><p>The ride back to your apartment was silent and tense. You had tried to make conversation with Hyuk, but he just tightened his grip on the wheel, knuckles turning white. Taking the hint, you stayed silent and looked out the window. Your phone kept buzzing, so you pulled it out to see several messages from new numbers.</p><p><b>+820245674823: Hey Y/n-ah! It\u2019s Jimin! ^^</b></p><p><b>+820257609483: This is Hobi! </b></p><p><b>+820284763947: Hello, Y/n, it\u2019s Namjoon (:</b></p><p><b>+820248576930: Jungkookie is here!</b></p><p><b>+820274539274: Hello worldwide beautiful (;</b></p><p><b>+820247593294: Y/n!!! It\u2019s Tae ((::</b></p><p><b>+820284639292: Yoongi&hellip;</b></p><p><b></b></p><p>You smiled and saved their numbers in your contacts, frowning when you saw Yoongi\u2019s message. You could sense he still felt guilty towards what had happened and it made you sad. Opening a new chat, you typed out a message just to Yoongi.</p><p><b>You: Hey Yoongi-ssi, I wanted to tell you that what happened today isn\u2019t a big deal. I forgive you and hope we can be friends in the future! ^.^</b></p><p>Remembering you left the others on read, you quickly answered them.</p><p><b>You: Hey guys! It\u2019s Y/n ;;</b></p><p><b>Jiminie: Y/n!</b></p><p><b>Namjoonie: (:</b></p><p><b>Kookie: Do you play any games?</b></p><p><b>Hobi Hobi~: Hi cutie! </b></p><p><b>TaeTae: If you do let\u2019s get together and play!!</b></p><p>Hearing Hyuk scoff, you quickly answered Taehyung and Jungkook. Afterwards you silenced your phone and put it away. As soon as you got home, you picked up a sleeping Yuna and brought her into your guest room. You placed her on the bed, tucking her in, and giving her a light kiss to the forehead. Back in the living room you saw Hyuk sitting there on the couch. </p><p>When he saw you come in, he stood up and crossed his arms, \u201cSo. Let\u2019s have a talk, <i>shall we</i>?\u201d You gulped and slowly sat down, him joining you although a distance was between you. </p><p>\n\n\u201cWhat do you want to talk about?\u201d you quietly spoke, afraid talking too loud would anger him even more and wake Yuna up. As much as you didn\u2019t want to talk about today, you knew you had to. Especially if you didn\u2019t want Hyuk to break up with you. You had spent so much time with him and you did truly love him.</p><p>He scoffed and gave you a burning gaze, \u201cOh I don\u2019t know maybe about how you stayed silent when they were shit talking our relationship?\u201d When you didn\u2019t say anything, he continued, \u201cOr do you wanna talk about how you apparently almost <i>kissed </i>one of them? Hmm?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to. We were just staring at each other and next thing I knew we were both leaning in&hellip;\u201d trailing off towards the end, you gazed at the coffee table suddenly imagining what it would have felt like to actually feel Jimin\u2019s lips on your own&hellip; </p><p>\u201cDamn it Y/n! Stop daydreaming about them!\u201d Hyuk\u2019s loud voice made you jump, not even realizing you had stopped listening to him. </p><p>You looked down at your clasped hands, \u201cI don\u2019t get why you\u2019re so mad..\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre-Are you fucking serious? Tell me you\u2019re joking,\u201d he was getting louder and louder the more the conversation dragged on. You could tell he was fuming and you really did want to calm him down, but sometimes you just didn\u2019t know what to say. And right now was one of them as all you could get out was a small \u2018uhh..\u2019</p><p>He stood up abruptly and started pacing, \u201cI swear to God you\u2019re so fucking dumb sometimes! They were blatantly telling us we don\u2019t belong together! And all you did was stand there and act like they weren\u2019t being complete assholes!\u201d He was almost yelling at this point. It was when you were once again not paying him any attention that he finally did yell, \u201cAgain! You\u2019re not listening to me again!\u201d </p><p>\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry&hellip;\u201d you said it so quietly he almost didn\u2019t hear you. You hated when anyone so much as raised their voice at you, so hearing him yell at you made you extra quiet and cautious.\u00a0</p><p>\n\nHe slammed his hand down on your coffee table, causing you to jump. Tears started welling up in your eyes as you thought back to when he was going to hit you. Was he going to try again? And if he did what were you going to do? No one was here to stop him. Sure, he had yelled at you and verbally abused you when he was really fired up, but never has he tried to physically hurt you. Maybe it was best if you never talked to the members of BTS if it meant he wouldn\u2019t hit you\u2026\u00a0</p><p>\n\n\u201cHyuk,\u201d your voice rang louder and steadier than you anticipated, but it had gained his attention. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for everything that happened tonight. I promise I won\u2019t talk to them at all,\u201d you continued as you pulled your phone out of your back pocket. You blamed it on the guilt you were feeling, but you knew you were in fact just scared of what he could possibly do. Pulling up the groupchat, you typed out two simple sentences.\u00a0</p><p><b>Y/n: I\u2019m sorry, but I think it\u2019d be best if we forgot we ever met. Please, never contact me again. </b></p><p>Hyuk sighed as he sat down beside you, \u201cThank you. That\u2019s all I wanted baby. You\u2019re doing the right thing. Now, let\u2019s go to bed. Okay?\u201d He kissed your head and walked off to your bedroom, with you trailing slowly behind. If you were doing the right thing, why did your heart hurt so much?</p><p>Tag List:</p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m0xlEzF31DDa0fN64pj-LVg\">@child-ofthe-moon-and-leaves</a>, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJR34GwkPsmybwJPP-Ism7Q\">@chari-a</a>, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mDgROAbdWbF3odtSgGHHCHQ\">@cjisluckycharm</a>, @huhuehuey, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_IswLp8Nh3qYkfo9uxTXAQ\">@childfmoonn</a>, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mUvVK503Q85wBLDiS5znVUA\">@goldenkookss</a>, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mdEEBFBbu511fEDrNizCDpg\">@jiminsreina</a>, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mbZHGrbNd9LTamoCuFZ-nKw\">@i-am-canada-13</a>, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mXnuEdcyIaJOfNgvehhtA6A\">@eilowyneleyne</a>, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m7GMHwUBJTFTZtEI2sFahMA\">@2seokkyo</a>, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mnslOkmdy8fKmKEy_LjCo3A\">@lokathefemale</a>, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mRSgvA0581tpJLmYOUADxFw\">@raja-in-demigodishness</a>, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mZAEPzW57lykuMCPo8xD9ZQ\">@shelley-hennig14</a>, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJ1hCquuvFJSe2y2-KnDmxw\">@theshiningmoonsblog</a>, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfUOiXgX0RSFW_H7x9sYuPg\">@agoddesswithablade</a>, @the-argus-eyed, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mWr0d1J_Mzp14lWm-D7Gbqg\">@btsstan4life</a>, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mukQIa7QxtycVpKzMNjEMcA\">@jinniepeachxo</a>, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJYgzQf3SnKiGvarX8TAKZA\">@purpleheartsfortae</a>, @nari2220, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m-BlHCnpyZ3oVsNcwIcr1WA\">@k00kjals</a>, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mmUecdCXhJQ1A2GqmJ_65Vw\">@yasbts705</a>, @moxxie84, @breadcaaat, @kpopgirlbtssvt, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mmv-vuGCF6ZXLm0iGu0deMQ\">@kamibyul</a></p>",

Taking a deep breath in, you followed as well. When you walked in you could see all of the guys glaring at your boyfriend with distaste, tension strong in the air. Yet, as soon as you came into their line of sight, the glares softened, smiles gracing their faces, the air feeling light and happy once again.

Though this proved to be difficult as he just kept tightening his grip.</p><p>You cleared your throat, trying to lighten the mood, \u201cHi.\u201d The sound of your voice seemed to calm the stiff hybrids. </p><p>The golden retriever, who you remember him introducing himself as \u2018Hobi\u2019 stepped forward. \u201cHello!\u201d he said brightly, his tail wagging back and forth in excitement. It was cute how excited he got when meeting new people and you couldn\u2019t help but to giggle. His ears twitched and his eyes lit up when he heard it.</p><p>\n\n\u201cHello, thank you for coming back here,\u201d Namjoon said as he held his hand out to you. Shaking his hand, you smiled politely. As you let go of his hand, his smile somewhat left his face but he was quick to make it return before you could notice.\u00a0</p>[[MORE]]<p><b></b></p><p>Jin grabbed your hand and kissed the back of it, \u201cHello again beautiful.\u201d You could feel your cheeks burning as your eyes widened. Hearing Hyuk scoff, you were reminded of his presence and coughed awkwardly. Feeling his hold on your hand tighten, you glanced at him and saw him glaring with a frown on his face. Feelings of guilt slowly built up inside of you. Here you were allowing some guy to flirt with you in front of your boyfriend.</p><p>Namjoon cleared his throat, gesturing to the two couches in the corner of the room, \u201cWhy don\u2019t we sit?\u201d</p><p>The three of you followed behind them. You let go of your boyfriend\u2019s hand and sat down in the middle. Hyuk was about to sit by you, but Jimin beat him to it with Taehyung sitting on your other side. You looked apologetically to Hyuk as he huffed and sat on the other couch. Hoseok sat in front of you, leaning back on your legs. Jin sat on the other side of Taehyung with Jungkook choosing to sit by Jimin. The two remaining boys, Yoongi and Namjoon, sat on the floor either side of Hoseok. You knew without even looking that Hyuk was glaring at them all.</p><p>\u201cWould you like me to sit by you baby?\u201d you asked him as you went to get up. Having all of them sitting so close to you was becoming a little too overwhelming. Before you could fully stand, Jimin wrapped his tail around your waist and Taehyung put his arm around your shoulders\u00a0while the rest of the boys growled.</p><p>Hyuk raised an eyebrow, \u201cActually yeah, I would like it if my <i>girlfriend </i>would come sit by me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAunt Y/n? Where can I sit?\u201d Yuna quietly ask you before a fight could break out. You were grateful she said something because you knew how bad Hyuk\u2019s anger could get and you also knew hybrids had intense instincts.</p><p>Before you could answer her, Jimin held his arms out to her, \u201cYou can sit on my lap cutie!\u201d You heart skipped a beat as you saw him pull her onto his lap. He looked so adorable interacting with her. Yuna smiled big as she looked at him with admiration. He was her favorite after all.</p><p>\u201cCan I pet your ears?\u201d Yuna\u2019s question brought you out of your thoughts.</p><p>Your eyes widened, \u201cYuna! You can\u2019t just ask that!\u201d You turned to Jimin as you apologized, \u201cI\u2019m so sorry Jimin-ssi.\u201d He just smiled at you and allowed Yuna to pet his ears. You smiled as he started purring, the sound relaxing you further.</p><p>Everyone broke off into their separate conversations. Jimin and Jungkook were talking to Yuna, while Namjoon and Hoseok were quietly whispering to each other, glancing at Hyuk every once in a while, and Yoongi was just sitting there silently. As you were talking to Jin and Taehyung, you could feel someone\u2019s eyes on you. Thinking it was Hyuk, you looked at him only to find out he was on his phone. Tilting your head to the side, you looked around the room to see who it was. Your breath hitched as soon as you made eye contact with Yoongi. His gaze held so much pain and regret that you had to avert your eyes. He let out a whimper and the noise caused everyone to look at the two of you.</p><p>\u201cJagi..\u201d Yoongi\u2019s voice was quiet and he timidly put his hand on your knee. He let out another whimper when you flinched away from him. When tears gathered in his eyes, Hoseok put his arm around him.</p><p>Hyuk cleared his throat and crossed his arms, \u201cI\u2019d like if you wouldn\u2019t call her Jagi. Only I can do that. Besides, she\u2019s <i>afraid</i> of you. Don\u2019t you remember?\u201d A smirk was present on his face as he looked Yoongi in the eyes. You couldn\u2019t believe what you were hearing. You knew Yoongi felt bad about what had happened and it angered you that Hyuk was being so inconsiderate. \n\n</p><p><b></b></p><p>You expected Yoongi to retaliate and start a fight, but were shocked to see him only tense up before leaving the room quickly, his tail wrapped around his waist and his ears down. It was strange to see him looking so vulnerable. Yuna had told you how he acts like he doesn\u2019t care, but you could also remember him saying how much of a softie he was. You were brought out of your thoughts when Hoseok follow him, sending a heated glare in your boyfriend\u2019s direction. For some strange reason, you felt your chest hurt when they left. Rubbing your chest lightly, you looked back to the rest of the group. The BTS members that remained looked at you knowingly. You were about to ask if Yoongi would be okay, but Hyuk spoke up.</p><p>\u201cIs he always such a baby?\u201d he snorted and smugly looked at the guys. They all growled at him, their tails swaying in anger, their eyes staring daggers at him.</p><p>Surprisingly it was Jungkook who spoke up, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you shut the fuck up?</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you make me <i>bunny</i>,\u201d Hyuk spat out at Jungkook and sniggered when all he did was take a deep breath and turn around. He chuckled at Jungkook\u2019s back, \u201cThat\u2019s what I thought. Poor little shy bunny can\u2019t do shi-\u201d He was cut off by Jungkook\u2019s fist hitting his jaw. You gasped and covered your mouth as Jungkook fell on top of him, continuing to land punches on his face. Yuna started yelling and crying as the boys grabbed a hold of him and hauled him off of your boyfriend.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d you asked as you ran over and helped him up off the floor. Yuna followed behind you and grabbed your hand tightly. Just then, Yoongi and Hoseok walked through the door into the room. The frigid atmosphere made them stop in their tracks and become on guard. Their sharp eyes quickly looked around the room to see what happened.</p><p>Hoseok was the one to break the stressful silence, \u201cUh what happened here?\u201d No one uttered a single word, making you bit your lip anxiously. God, you didn\u2019t know what you would do if they all started fighting again. You especially didn\u2019t know how to feel now that Yoongi was back. On one hand you were excited he came back, but on the other hand you were slightly afraid. Yet somewhere deep down inside of you, you knew he would never intentionally hurt you.</p><p>Hyuk wiped his lip, looking up at Jungkook straight in the eyes, \u201cYou\u2019re lucky you\u2019re in some famous band or else you\u2019d be <i>dead</i>.\u201d Your eyes became wide as you stared at him in disbelief. Was he stupid? Why was he threatening a famous person? A <i>hybrid </i>at that!</p><p>\n\n\u201cY/n, why don\u2019t you take Yuna and go buy some merch? It\u2019s on us,\u201d Namjoon said as he waved over a security guard proceeding to tell him something all the while keeping his eyes locked on Hyuk. Said security guard nodded and led both you and Yuna out of the room. As soon as the door shut behind you, you could hear someone inside start yelling, other voices joining in. You could feel yourself start to panic, not wanting anyone to get hurt anymore.\n\n</p><p>Looking away from the door, you tightened your grip on Yuna\u2019s hand and followed the guard down a hallway. Once you guys got to the little store they had, you looked down at your niece, \u201cOkay Yuna, choose what you like and I\u2019ll get it for you sweetie.\u201d Yuna gasped and looked at you with shining eyes, excited to be able to get BTS merch. Like she always told you, you could never have too much.\n\n</p><p>\u201cMa\u2019am, Mr. Kim said he would pay for it. So you don\u2019t have to worry about money,\u201d the security guard said as he held up a shiny, silver card. From what he had said you could tell it was Namjoon\u2019s credit card. </p><p>You put your hands out in front of you, stuttering slightly with eyes opened wide in disbelief, \u201cOh! No thank you! I can pay for myself. He doesn\u2019t have to worry about paying for me haha..\u201d You trailed off as he tried to hand the credit card to you. Key word being tried as you quickly moved away from him. Walking over to where Yuna was looking at some t-shirts, you heard the man clear his throat. Pretending to not have heard him you stood next to your niece, \u201cSo Yuna Tuna, what have you thought of getting?\u201d </p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s so much I wanna get, but I don\u2019t want to waste your money and Appa only gave me \u20a950,000,\u201d Yuna pouted as she put the shirt back. In her arms she already held two shirts and a poster. You were about to reply, telling her she could get whatever and <i>you\u2019d </i>pay for it, but it seems like the security guard, who was starting to get on your nerves by the way, beat you to it. </p><p>He picked the t-shirt Yuna had previously put down back up and handed it to her, \u201cYou can get this Ms. Yuna. Rm-ssi said he\u2019d buy it for you.\u201d </p><p>Okay, now he was <i>really </i>getting on your nerves. You scoffed, rolling your eyes at the man. Why didn\u2019t he get the hint you could pay for it? Actually, why did Namjoon think you couldn\u2019t pay for it? Did he pity you?</p><p>Yuna gasped and grabbed the piece of clothing from his hands, smiling up at him and then at you. Seeing her so excited made you soften your tight stance. You could always pay Namjoon back. Granted it might take you a while, especially after seeing how much Yuna was getting. So far, she had six shirts, two different tote bags, a headband, and another one of their CD\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cYuna, don\u2019t get too much okay? It\u2019s not nice to spend all of someone\u2019s money,\u201d you said as you followed behind her.</p><p>She looked back at you as she put everything on the counter to be checked out, \u201cBut Namjoon said I could get anything.\u201d A pout was present on her face as the cashier rang up her merchandise.</p><p>\u201cI know he did sweetie, but it\u2019s still not polite to spend people\u2019s money. It\u2019s always a good thing to be independent and not rely on someone,\u201d you voiced as pulled your wallet out. Just because Namjoon said they would pay for it didn\u2019t mean you weren\u2019t going to try and pay for it yourself. You were a strong and independent woman after all.</p><p>As you and the little girl had a stare off, the cashier had finished ringing the items up and cleared their throat, \u201cThat\u2019ll be \u20a9170,000 please.\u201d The security guard handed the lady the credit card before you could whip yours out.</p><p>Huffing, you crossed your arms, slightly pouting, not knowing the rest of the boys were standing behind you. Someone coughed, making you turn around in shock. As you turned around, you swore you heard one of the boys mumble out the word \u2018cute\u2019. You waved awkwardly, completely embarrassed they had seen your small act.</p><p>\u201cNamjoon-sii! Thank you for letting me get all of this merch!\u201d Yuna bowed and looked up at him in admiration. You could tell just by looking at her interact with them how much she admired them and the thought made your heart swell. She was too cute for her own good.</p><p>While Yuna was talking to the boys, showing them what she got in the process, you walked over to stand next to your angry boyfriend. You leaned over and whispered in his ear, \u201cHey baby, how are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\n\n\u201cHow am I doing? Really? Are you really asking me that right now?\u201d he scoffed, shaking his head and shifting away from you. He didn\u2019t understand how you could be so idiotic at times. Like right now, how you were just letting them talk about your relationship with him and not even say anything was making his temper rise to dangerous levels.\u00a0</p><p>Leaning away from him, you tried to hide the hurt shown on your face, \u201cI just wanted to make sure you were okay\u2026\u201d </p><p>\u201cThis is why she shouldn\u2019t be dating you. You treat her like shit,\u201d Jungkook\u2019s broke into the conversation. Jimin brought Yuna over to look at some of the posters and you silently thanked him. You really didn\u2019t want her to hear them fight. <i>Again</i>. </p><p>Hyuk looked the bunny hybrid in the eyes, \u201cOh you really don\u2019t know when to shut your mouth bunny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you not to fucking call me that,\u201d Jungkook spat at Hyuk, the rest of the boys, excluding Yoongi, tried to calm him down. Yoongi was just staring at you intensely. </p><p>\u201cHyuk, you need to calm down,\u201d your voice was soft, trying to calm the agitated man. </p><p>He ripped his arm out of your grasp and shifted his glare to you, \u201cDo you not hear what they are saying right now Y/n? Are you really that fucking dumb?\u201d When all you could do was stare at him, he grew unnerved and raised his hand. You flinched, expecting to feel the sting, but was met with growling instead. There, stood in front of you, with Hyuk\u2019s wrist in his own hand, was Yoongi. Your heart skipped a beat. Yoongi. <i>He </i>stopped Hyuk from hitting you. </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you <i>dare </i>lay a hand on her or I\u2019ll fucking break both of your hands,\u201d Yoongi\u2019s words were low, a threatening growl in the back of his throat. Your boyfriend went to raise his other hand, but was stopped by Hoseok grabbing it. </p><p>You walked around both Yoongi and Hoseok, voice quiet and a slight tremble to it, \u201cI think it\u2019d be best if we left. Thank you for allowing us backstage to hang out and thank you for buying Yuna things. I greatly appreciate it.\u201d Finishing your words, you bowed low and called Yuna over. </p><p>\u201cWait, Y/n, can we at least get your phone number? We want to hang out some more\u2026\u201d Jimin trailed off as he saw the look Hyuk was giving him. Saying yes meant you would disappoint your boyfriend\u2026but saying no meant you\u2019d be hurting <i>seven </i>people. And you know what they say, majority always wins.</p><p>Glancing between both boys, you made up your mind, \u201cOf course you can Jimin-ssi.\u201d Hyuk\u2019s head snapped towards you, but you ignored it. It wasn\u2019t technically your fault. He was the one who got in a fight with them. Not you.\u00a0Plus, you felt this certain pull making you want to get to know them even more. \n\n</p><p>Grabbing Jimin\u2019s phone, you typed in your number then handed it back to him. A few seconds later and your phone buzzed in your back pocket. You thought better and decided to take a look at it when Hyuk was asleep. Bidding them goodbye, you left behind Hyuk with Yuna\u2019s hand in your own. She happily skipped next to you, her purchases in her unoccupied hand.</p><p>\u20130\u20130\u20130\u20130\u2013</p><p>The ride back to your apartment was silent and tense. You had tried to make conversation with Hyuk, but he just tightened his grip on the wheel, knuckles turning white. Taking the hint, you stayed silent and looked out the window. Your phone kept buzzing, so you pulled it out to see several messages from new numbers.</p><p><b>+820245674823: Hey Y/n-ah! It\u2019s Jimin! ^^</b></p><p><b>+820257609483: This is Hobi! </b></p><p><b>+820284763947: Hello, Y/n, it\u2019s Namjoon (:</b></p><p><b>+820248576930: Jungkookie is here!</b></p><p><b>+820274539274: Hello worldwide beautiful (;</b></p><p><b>+820247593294: Y/n!!! It\u2019s Tae ((::</b></p><p><b>+820284639292: Yoongi\u2026</b></p><p><b></b></p><p>You smiled and saved their numbers in your contacts, frowning when you saw Yoongi\u2019s message. You could sense he still felt guilty towards what had happened and it made you sad. Opening a new chat, you typed out a message just to Yoongi.</p><p><b>You: Hey Yoongi-ssi, I wanted to tell you that what happened today isn\u2019t a big deal. I forgive you and hope we can be friends in the future! ^.^</b></p><p>Remembering you left the others on read, you quickly answered them.</p><p><b>You: Hey guys! It\u2019s Y/n ;;</b></p><p><b>Jiminie: Y/n!</b></p><p><b>Namjoonie: (:</b></p><p><b>Kookie: Do you play any games?</b></p><p><b>Hobi Hobi~: Hi cutie! </b></p><p><b>TaeTae: If you do let\u2019s get together and play!!</b></p><p>Hearing Hyuk scoff, you quickly answered Taehyung and Jungkook. Afterwards you silenced your phone and put it away. As soon as you got home, you picked up a sleeping Yuna and brought her into your guest room. You placed her on the bed, tucking her in, and giving her a light kiss to the forehead. Back in the living room you saw Hyuk sitting there on the couch. </p><p>When he saw you come in, he stood up and crossed his arms, \u201cSo. Let\u2019s have a talk, <i>shall we</i>?\u201d You gulped and slowly sat down, him joining you although a distance was between you. </p><p>\n\n\u201cWhat do you want to talk about?\u201d you quietly spoke, afraid talking too loud would anger him even more and wake Yuna up. As much as you didn\u2019t want to talk about today, you knew you had to. Especially if you didn\u2019t want Hyuk to break up with you. You had spent so much time with him and you did truly love him.</p><p>He scoffed and gave you a burning gaze, \u201cOh I don\u2019t know maybe about how you stayed silent when they were shit talking our relationship?\u201d When you didn\u2019t say anything, he continued, \u201cOr do you wanna talk about how you apparently almost <i>kissed </i>one of them? Hmm?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to. We were just staring at each other and next thing I knew we were both leaning in\u2026\u201d trailing off towards the end, you gazed at the coffee table suddenly imagining what it would have felt like to actually feel Jimin\u2019s lips on your own\u2026 </p><p>\u201cDamn it Y/n! Stop daydreaming about them!\u201d Hyuk\u2019s loud voice made you jump, not even realizing you had stopped listening to him. </p><p>You looked down at your clasped hands, \u201cI don\u2019t get why you\u2019re so mad..\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre-Are you fucking serious? Tell me you\u2019re joking,\u201d he was getting louder and louder the more the conversation dragged on. You could tell he was fuming and you really did want to calm him down, but sometimes you just didn\u2019t know what to say. And right now was one of them as all you could get out was a small \u2018uhh..\u2019</p><p>He stood up abruptly and started pacing, \u201cI swear to God you\u2019re so fucking dumb sometimes! They were blatantly telling us we don\u2019t belong together! And all you did was stand there and act like they weren\u2019t being complete assholes!\u201d He was almost yelling at this point. It was when you were once again not paying him any attention that he finally did yell, \u201cAgain! You\u2019re not listening to me again!\u201d </p><p>\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2026\u201d you said it so quietly he almost didn\u2019t hear you. You hated when anyone so much as raised their voice at you, so hearing him yell at you made you extra quiet and cautious.\u00a0</p><p>\n\nHe slammed his hand down on your coffee table, causing you to jump. Tears started welling up in your eyes as you thought back to when he was going to hit you. Was he going to try again? And if he did what were you going to do? No one was here to stop him. Sure, he had yelled at you and verbally abused you when he was really fired up, but never has he tried to physically hurt you. Maybe it was best if you never talked to the members of BTS if it meant he wouldn\u2019t hit you\u2026\u00a0</p><p>\n\n\u201cHyuk,\u201d your voice rang louder and steadier than you anticipated, but it had gained his attention. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for everything that happened tonight. I promise I won\u2019t talk to them at all,\u201d you continued as you pulled your phone out of your back pocket. You blamed it on the guilt you were feeling, but you knew you were in fact just scared of what he could possibly do. Pulling up the groupchat, you typed out two simple sentences.\u00a0</p><p><b>Y/n: I\u2019m sorry, but I think it\u2019d be best if we forgot we ever met. Please, never contact me again. </b></p><p>Hyuk sighed as he sat down beside you, \u201cThank you. That\u2019s all I wanted baby. You\u2019re doing the right thing. Now, let\u2019s go to bed. Okay?\u201d He kissed your head and walked off to your bedroom, with you trailing slowly behind. If you were doing the right thing, why did your heart hurt so much?</p><p>Tag List:</p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m0xlEzF31DDa0fN64pj-LVg\">@child-ofthe-moon-and-leaves</a>, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJR34GwkPsmybwJPP-Ism7Q\">@chari-a</a>, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mDgROAbdWbF3odtSgGHHCHQ\">@cjisluckycharm</a>, @huhuehuey, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_IswLp8Nh3qYkfo9uxTXAQ\">@childfmoonn</a>, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mUvVK503Q85wBLDiS5znVUA\">@goldenkookss</a>, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mdEEBFBbu511fEDrNizCDpg\">@jiminsreina</a>, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mbZHGrbNd9LTamoCuFZ-nKw\">@i-am-canada-13</a>, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mXnuEdcyIaJOfNgvehhtA6A\">@eilowyneleyne</a>, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m7GMHwUBJTFTZtEI2sFahMA\">@2seokkyo</a>, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mnslOkmdy8fKmKEy_LjCo3A\">@lokathefemale</a>, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mRSgvA0581tpJLmYOUADxFw\">@raja-in-demigodishness</a>, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mZAEPzW57lykuMCPo8xD9ZQ\">@shelley-hennig14</a>, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJ1hCquuvFJSe2y2-KnDmxw\">@theshiningmoonsblog</a>, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfUOiXgX0RSFW_H7x9sYuPg\">@agoddesswithablade</a>, @the-argus-eyed, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mWr0d1J_Mzp14lWm-D7Gbqg\">@btsstan4life</a>, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mukQIa7QxtycVpKzMNjEMcA\">@jinniepeachxo</a>, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJYgzQf3SnKiGvarX8TAKZA\">@purpleheartsfortae</a>, @nari2220, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m-BlHCnpyZ3oVsNcwIcr1WA\">@k00kjals</a>, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mmUecdCXhJQ1A2GqmJ_65Vw\">@yasbts705</a>, @moxxie84, @breadcaaat, @kpopgirlbtssvt, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mmv-vuGCF6ZXLm0iGu0deMQ\">@kamibyul</a></p></p>",

Taking a deep breath in, you followed as well. When you walked in you could see all of the guys glaring at your boyfriend with distaste, tension strong in the air. Yet, as soon as you came into their line of sight, the glares softened, smiles gracing their faces, the air feeling light and happy once again. You nervously smiled back as you stood in between Yuna and Hyuk. Your boyfriend took your hand and the boys all lowly growled and glared at your joined hands. For some strange reason you didn\u2019t want to make them angry. You could pass it off as not wanting to offend them, but you knew you were just insecure of what they thought. So, not wanting to anger them any further, you tried to pull your hand out of Hyuk\u2019s grasp. Though this proved to be difficult as he just kept tightening his grip.</p><p>You cleared your throat, trying to lighten the mood, \u201cHi.\u201d The sound of your voice seemed to calm the stiff hybrids. </p><p>The golden retriever, who you remember him introducing himself as \u2018Hobi\u2019 stepped forward. \u201cHello!\u201d he said brightly, his tail wagging back and forth in excitement. It was cute how excited he got when meeting new people and you couldn\u2019t help but to giggle. His ears twitched and his eyes lit up when he heard it.</p><p>\n\n\u201cHello, thank you for coming back here,\u201d Namjoon said as he held his hand out to you. Shaking his hand, you smiled politely. As you let go of his hand, his smile somewhat left his face but he was quick to make it return before you could notice.\u00a0</p>[[MORE]]<p><b></b></p><p>Jin grabbed your hand and kissed the back of it, \u201cHello again beautiful.\u201d You could feel your cheeks burning as your eyes widened. Hearing Hyuk scoff, you were reminded of his presence and coughed awkwardly. Feeling his hold on your hand tighten, you glanced at him and saw him glaring with a frown on his face. Feelings of guilt slowly built up inside of you. Here you were allowing some guy to flirt with you in front of your boyfriend.</p><p>Namjoon cleared his throat, gesturing to the two couches in the corner of the room, \u201cWhy don\u2019t we sit?\u201d</p><p>The three of you followed behind them. You let go of your boyfriend\u2019s hand and sat down in the middle. Hyuk was about to sit by you, but Jimin beat him to it with Taehyung sitting on your other side. You looked apologetically to Hyuk as he huffed and sat on the other couch. Hoseok sat in front of you, leaning back on your legs. Jin sat on the other side of Taehyung with Jungkook choosing to sit by Jimin. The two remaining boys, Yoongi and Namjoon, sat on the floor either side of Hoseok. You knew without even looking that Hyuk was glaring at them all.</p><p>\u201cWould you like me to sit by you baby?\u201d you asked him as you went to get up. Having all of them sitting so close to you was becoming a little too overwhelming. Before you could fully stand, Jimin wrapped his tail around your waist and Taehyung put his arm around your shoulders\u00a0while the rest of the boys growled.</p><p>Hyuk raised an eyebrow, \u201cActually yeah, I would like it if my <i>girlfriend </i>would come sit by me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAunt Y/n? Where can I sit?\u201d Yuna quietly ask you before a fight could break out. You were grateful she said something because you knew how bad Hyuk\u2019s anger could get and you also knew hybrids had intense instincts.</p><p>Before you could answer her, Jimin held his arms out to her, \u201cYou can sit on my lap cutie!\u201d You heart skipped a beat as you saw him pull her onto his lap. He looked so adorable interacting with her. Yuna smiled big as she looked at him with admiration. He was her favorite after all.</p><p>\u201cCan I pet your ears?\u201d Yuna\u2019s question brought you out of your thoughts.</p><p>Your eyes widened, \u201cYuna! You can\u2019t just ask that!\u201d You turned to Jimin as you apologized, \u201cI\u2019m so sorry Jimin-ssi.\u201d He just smiled at you and allowed Yuna to pet his ears. You smiled as he started purring, the sound relaxing you further.</p><p>Everyone broke off into their separate conversations. Jimin and Jungkook were talking to Yuna, while Namjoon and Hoseok were quietly whispering to each other, glancing at Hyuk every once in a while, and Yoongi was just sitting there silently. As you were talking to Jin and Taehyung, you could feel someone\u2019s eyes on you. Thinking it was Hyuk, you looked at him only to find out he was on his phone. Tilting your head to the side, you looked around the room to see who it was. Your breath hitched as soon as you made eye contact with Yoongi. His gaze held so much pain and regret that you had to avert your eyes. He let out a whimper and the noise caused everyone to look at the two of you.</p><p>\u201cJagi..\u201d Yoongi\u2019s voice was quiet and he timidly put his hand on your knee. He let out another whimper when you flinched away from him. When tears gathered in his eyes, Hoseok put his arm around him.</p><p>Hyuk cleared his throat and crossed his arms, \u201cI\u2019d like if you wouldn\u2019t call her Jagi. Only I can do that. Besides, she\u2019s <i>afraid</i> of you. Don\u2019t you remember?\u201d A smirk was present on his face as he looked Yoongi in the eyes. You couldn\u2019t believe what you were hearing. You knew Yoongi felt bad about what had happened and it angered you that Hyuk was being so inconsiderate. \n\n</p><p><b></b></p><p>You expected Yoongi to retaliate and start a fight, but were shocked to see him only tense up before leaving the room quickly, his tail wrapped around his waist and his ears down. It was strange to see him looking so vulnerable. Yuna had told you how he acts like he doesn\u2019t care, but you could also remember him saying how much of a softie he was. You were brought out of your thoughts when Hoseok follow him, sending a heated glare in your boyfriend\u2019s direction. For some strange reason, you felt your chest hurt when they left. Rubbing your chest lightly, you looked back to the rest of the group. The BTS members that remained looked at you knowingly. You were about to ask if Yoongi would be okay, but Hyuk spoke up.</p><p>\u201cIs he always such a baby?\u201d he snorted and smugly looked at the guys. They all growled at him, their tails swaying in anger, their eyes staring daggers at him.</p><p>Surprisingly it was Jungkook who spoke up, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you shut the fuck up?</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you make me <i>bunny</i>,\u201d Hyuk spat out at Jungkook and sniggered when all he did was take a deep breath and turn around. He chuckled at Jungkook\u2019s back, \u201cThat\u2019s what I thought. Poor little shy bunny can\u2019t do shi-\u201d He was cut off by Jungkook\u2019s fist hitting his jaw. You gasped and covered your mouth as Jungkook fell on top of him, continuing to land punches on his face. Yuna started yelling and crying as the boys grabbed a hold of him and hauled him off of your boyfriend.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d you asked as you ran over and helped him up off the floor. Yuna followed behind you and grabbed your hand tightly. Just then, Yoongi and Hoseok walked through the door into the room. The frigid atmosphere made them stop in their tracks and become on guard. Their sharp eyes quickly looked around the room to see what happened.</p><p>Hoseok was the one to break the stressful silence, \u201cUh what happened here?\u201d No one uttered a single word, making you bit your lip anxiously. God, you didn\u2019t know what you would do if they all started fighting again. You especially didn\u2019t know how to feel now that Yoongi was back. On one hand you were excited he came back, but on the other hand you were slightly afraid. Yet somewhere deep down inside of you, you knew he would never intentionally hurt you.</p><p>Hyuk wiped his lip, looking up at Jungkook straight in the eyes, \u201cYou\u2019re lucky you\u2019re in some famous band or else you\u2019d be <i>dead</i>.\u201d Your eyes became wide as you stared at him in disbelief. Was he stupid? Why was he threatening a famous person? A <i>hybrid </i>at that!</p><p>\n\n\u201cY/n, why don\u2019t you take Yuna and go buy some merch? It\u2019s on us,\u201d Namjoon said as he waved over a security guard proceeding to tell him something all the while keeping his eyes locked on Hyuk. Said security guard nodded and led both you and Yuna out of the room. As soon as the door shut behind you, you could hear someone inside start yelling, other voices joining in. You could feel yourself start to panic, not wanting anyone to get hurt anymore.\n\n</p><p>Looking away from the door, you tightened your grip on Yuna\u2019s hand and followed the guard down a hallway. Once you guys got to the little store they had, you looked down at your niece, \u201cOkay Yuna, choose what you like and I\u2019ll get it for you sweetie.\u201d Yuna gasped and looked at you with shining eyes, excited to be able to get BTS merch. Like she always told you, you could never have too much.\n\n</p><p>\u201cMa\u2019am, Mr. Kim said he would pay for it. So you don\u2019t have to worry about money,\u201d the security guard said as he held up a shiny, silver card. From what he had said you could tell it was Namjoon\u2019s credit card. </p><p>You put your hands out in front of you, stuttering slightly with eyes opened wide in disbelief, \u201cOh! No thank you! I can pay for myself. He doesn\u2019t have to worry about paying for me haha..\u201d You trailed off as he tried to hand the credit card to you. Key word being tried as you quickly moved away from him. Walking over to where Yuna was looking at some t-shirts, you heard the man clear his throat. Pretending to not have heard him you stood next to your niece, \u201cSo Yuna Tuna, what have you thought of getting?\u201d </p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s so much I wanna get, but I don\u2019t want to waste your money and Appa only gave me \u20a950,000,\u201d Yuna pouted as she put the shirt back. In her arms she already held two shirts and a poster. You were about to reply, telling her she could get whatever and <i>you\u2019d </i>pay for it, but it seems like the security guard, who was starting to get on your nerves by the way, beat you to it. </p><p>He picked the t-shirt Yuna had previously put down back up and handed it to her, \u201cYou can get this Ms. Yuna. Rm-ssi said he\u2019d buy it for you.\u201d </p><p>Okay, now he was <i>really </i>getting on your nerves. You scoffed, rolling your eyes at the man. Why didn\u2019t he get the hint you could pay for it? Actually, why did Namjoon think you couldn\u2019t pay for it? Did he pity you?</p><p>Yuna gasped and grabbed the piece of clothing from his hands, smiling up at him and then at you. Seeing her so excited made you soften your tight stance. You could always pay Namjoon back. Granted it might take you a while, especially after seeing how much Yuna was getting. So far, she had six shirts, two different tote bags, a headband, and another one of their CD\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cYuna, don\u2019t get too much okay? It\u2019s not nice to spend all of someone\u2019s money,\u201d you said as you followed behind her.</p><p>She looked back at you as she put everything on the counter to be checked out, \u201cBut Namjoon said I could get anything.\u201d A pout was present on her face as the cashier rang up her merchandise.</p><p>\u201cI know he did sweetie, but it\u2019s still not polite to spend people\u2019s money. It\u2019s always a good thing to be independent and not rely on someone,\u201d you voiced as pulled your wallet out. Just because Namjoon said they would pay for it didn\u2019t mean you weren\u2019t going to try and pay for it yourself. You were a strong and independent woman after all.</p><p>As you and the little girl had a stare off, the cashier had finished ringing the items up and cleared their throat, \u201cThat\u2019ll be \u20a9170,000 please.\u201d The security guard handed the lady the credit card before you could whip yours out.</p><p>Huffing, you crossed your arms, slightly pouting, not knowing the rest of the boys were standing behind you. Someone coughed, making you turn around in shock. As you turned around, you swore you heard one of the boys mumble out the word \u2018cute\u2019. You waved awkwardly, completely embarrassed they had seen your small act.</p><p>\u201cNamjoon-sii! Thank you for letting me get all of this merch!\u201d Yuna bowed and looked up at him in admiration. You could tell just by looking at her interact with them how much she admired them and the thought made your heart swell. She was too cute for her own good.</p><p>While Yuna was talking to the boys, showing them what she got in the process, you walked over to stand next to your angry boyfriend. You leaned over and whispered in his ear, \u201cHey baby, how are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\n\n\u201cHow am I doing? Really? Are you really asking me that right now?\u201d he scoffed, shaking his head and shifting away from you. He didn\u2019t understand how you could be so idiotic at times. Like right now, how you were just letting them talk about your relationship with him and not even say anything was making his temper rise to dangerous levels.\u00a0</p><p>Leaning away from him, you tried to hide the hurt shown on your face, \u201cI just wanted to make sure you were okay\u2026\u201d </p><p>\u201cThis is why she shouldn\u2019t be dating you. You treat her like shit,\u201d Jungkook\u2019s broke into the conversation. Jimin brought Yuna over to look at some of the posters and you silently thanked him. You really didn\u2019t want her to hear them fight. <i>Again</i>. </p><p>Hyuk looked the bunny hybrid in the eyes, \u201cOh you really don\u2019t know when to shut your mouth bunny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you not to fucking call me that,\u201d Jungkook spat at Hyuk, the rest of the boys, excluding Yoongi, tried to calm him down. Yoongi was just staring at you intensely. </p><p>\u201cHyuk, you need to calm down,\u201d your voice was soft, trying to calm the agitated man. </p><p>He ripped his arm out of your grasp and shifted his glare to you, \u201cDo you not hear what they are saying right now Y/n? Are you really that fucking dumb?\u201d When all you could do was stare at him, he grew unnerved and raised his hand. You flinched, expecting to feel the sting, but was met with growling instead. There, stood in front of you, with Hyuk\u2019s wrist in his own hand, was Yoongi. Your heart skipped a beat. Yoongi. <i>He </i>stopped Hyuk from hitting you. </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you <i>dare </i>lay a hand on her or I\u2019ll fucking break both of your hands,\u201d Yoongi\u2019s words were low, a threatening growl in the back of his throat. Your boyfriend went to raise his other hand, but was stopped by Hoseok grabbing it. </p><p>You walked around both Yoongi and Hoseok, voice quiet and a slight tremble to it, \u201cI think it\u2019d be best if we left. Thank you for allowing us backstage to hang out and thank you for buying Yuna things. I greatly appreciate it.\u201d Finishing your words, you bowed low and called Yuna over. </p><p>\u201cWait, Y/n, can we at least get your phone number? We want to hang out some more\u2026\u201d Jimin trailed off as he saw the look Hyuk was giving him. Saying yes meant you would disappoint your boyfriend\u2026but saying no meant you\u2019d be hurting <i>seven </i>people. And you know what they say, majority always wins.</p><p>Glancing between both boys, you made up your mind, \u201cOf course you can Jimin-ssi.\u201d Hyuk\u2019s head snapped towards you, but you ignored it. It wasn\u2019t technically your fault. He was the one who got in a fight with them. Not you.\u00a0Plus, you felt this certain pull making you want to get to know them even more. \n\n</p><p>Grabbing Jimin\u2019s phone, you typed in your number then handed it back to him. A few seconds later and your phone buzzed in your back pocket. You thought better and decided to take a look at it when Hyuk was asleep. Bidding them goodbye, you left behind Hyuk with Yuna\u2019s hand in your own. She happily skipped next to you, her purchases in her unoccupied hand.</p><p>\u20130\u20130\u20130\u20130\u2013</p><p>The ride back to your apartment was silent and tense. You had tried to make conversation with Hyuk, but he just tightened his grip on the wheel, knuckles turning white. Taking the hint, you stayed silent and looked out the window. Your phone kept buzzing, so you pulled it out to see several messages from new numbers.</p><p><b>+820245674823: Hey Y/n-ah! It\u2019s Jimin! ^^</b></p><p><b>+820257609483: This is Hobi! </b></p><p><b>+820284763947: Hello, Y/n, it\u2019s Namjoon (:</b></p><p><b>+820248576930: Jungkookie is here!</b></p><p><b>+820274539274: Hello worldwide beautiful (;</b></p><p><b>+820247593294: Y/n!!! It\u2019s Tae ((::</b></p><p><b>+820284639292: Yoongi\u2026</b></p><p><b></b></p><p>You smiled and saved their numbers in your contacts, frowning when you saw Yoongi\u2019s message. You could sense he still felt guilty towards what had happened and it made you sad. Opening a new chat, you typed out a message just to Yoongi.</p><p><b>You: Hey Yoongi-ssi, I wanted to tell you that what happened today isn\u2019t a big deal. I forgive you and hope we can be friends in the future! ^.^</b></p><p>Remembering you left the others on read, you quickly answered them.</p><p><b>You: Hey guys! It\u2019s Y/n ;;</b></p><p><b>Jiminie: Y/n!</b></p><p><b>Namjoonie: (:</b></p><p><b>Kookie: Do you play any games?</b></p><p><b>Hobi Hobi~: Hi cutie! </b></p><p><b>TaeTae: If you do let\u2019s get together and play!!</b></p><p>Hearing Hyuk scoff, you quickly answered Taehyung and Jungkook. Afterwards you silenced your phone and put it away. As soon as you got home, you picked up a sleeping Yuna and brought her into your guest room. You placed her on the bed, tucking her in, and giving her a light kiss to the forehead. Back in the living room you saw Hyuk sitting there on the couch. </p><p>When he saw you come in, he stood up and crossed his arms, \u201cSo. Let\u2019s have a talk, <i>shall we</i>?\u201d You gulped and slowly sat down, him joining you although a distance was between you. </p><p>\n\n\u201cWhat do you want to talk about?\u201d you quietly spoke, afraid talking too loud would anger him even more and wake Yuna up. As much as you didn\u2019t want to talk about today, you knew you had to. Especially if you didn\u2019t want Hyuk to break up with you. You had spent so much time with him and you did truly love him.</p><p>He scoffed and gave you a burning gaze, \u201cOh I don\u2019t know maybe about how you stayed silent when they were shit talking our relationship?\u201d When you didn\u2019t say anything, he continued, \u201cOr do you wanna talk about how you apparently almost <i>kissed </i>one of them? Hmm?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to. We were just staring at each other and next thing I knew we were both leaning in\u2026\u201d trailing off towards the end, you gazed at the coffee table suddenly imagining what it would have felt like to actually feel Jimin\u2019s lips on your own\u2026 </p><p>\u201cDamn it Y/n! Stop daydreaming about them!\u201d Hyuk\u2019s loud voice made you jump, not even realizing you had stopped listening to him. </p><p>You looked down at your clasped hands, \u201cI don\u2019t get why you\u2019re so mad..\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre-Are you fucking serious? Tell me you\u2019re joking,\u201d he was getting louder and louder the more the conversation dragged on. You could tell he was fuming and you really did want to calm him down, but sometimes you just didn\u2019t know what to say. And right now was one of them as all you could get out was a small \u2018uhh..\u2019</p><p>He stood up abruptly and started pacing, \u201cI swear to God you\u2019re so fucking dumb sometimes! They were blatantly telling us we don\u2019t belong together! And all you did was stand there and act like they weren\u2019t being complete assholes!\u201d He was almost yelling at this point. It was when you were once again not paying him any attention that he finally did yell, \u201cAgain! You\u2019re not listening to me again!\u201d </p><p>\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2026\u201d you said it so quietly he almost didn\u2019t hear you. You hated when anyone so much as raised their voice at you, so hearing him yell at you made you extra quiet and cautious.\u00a0</p><p>\n\nHe slammed his hand down on your coffee table, causing you to jump. Tears started welling up in your eyes as you thought back to when he was going to hit you. Was he going to try again? And if he did what were you going to do? No one was here to stop him. Sure, he had yelled at you and verbally abused you when he was really fired up, but never has he tried to physically hurt you. Maybe it was best if you never talked to the members of BTS if it meant he wouldn\u2019t hit you\u2026\u00a0</p><p>\n\n\u201cHyuk,\u201d your voice rang louder and steadier than you anticipated, but it had gained his attention. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for everything that happened tonight. I promise I won\u2019t talk to them at all,\u201d you continued as you pulled your phone out of your back pocket. You blamed it on the guilt you were feeling, but you knew you were in fact just scared of what he could possibly do. Pulling up the groupchat, you typed out two simple sentences.\u00a0</p><p><b>Y/n: I\u2019m sorry, but I think it\u2019d be best if we forgot we ever met. Please, never contact me again. </b></p><p>Hyuk sighed as he sat down beside you, \u201cThank you. That\u2019s all I wanted baby. You\u2019re doing the right thing. Now, let\u2019s go to bed. Okay?\u201d He kissed your head and walked off to your bedroom, with you trailing slowly behind. If you were doing the right thing, why did your heart hurt so much?</p><p>Tag List:</p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m0xlEzF31DDa0fN64pj-LVg\">@child-ofthe-moon-and-leaves</a>, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJR34GwkPsmybwJPP-Ism7Q\">@chari-a</a>, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mDgROAbdWbF3odtSgGHHCHQ\">@cjisluckycharm</a>, @huhuehuey, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_IswLp8Nh3qYkfo9uxTXAQ\">@childfmoonn</a>, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mUvVK503Q85wBLDiS5znVUA\">@goldenkookss</a>, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mdEEBFBbu511fEDrNizCDpg\">@jiminsreina</a>, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mbZHGrbNd9LTamoCuFZ-nKw\">@i-am-canada-13</a>, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mXnuEdcyIaJOfNgvehhtA6A\">@eilowyneleyne</a>, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m7GMHwUBJTFTZtEI2sFahMA\">@2seokkyo</a>, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mnslOkmdy8fKmKEy_LjCo3A\">@lokathefemale</a>, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mRSgvA0581tpJLmYOUADxFw\">@raja-in-demigodishness</a>, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mZAEPzW57lykuMCPo8xD9ZQ\">@shelley-hennig14</a>, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJ1hCquuvFJSe2y2-KnDmxw\">@theshiningmoonsblog</a>, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfUOiXgX0RSFW_H7x9sYuPg\">@agoddesswithablade</a>, @the-argus-eyed, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mWr0d1J_Mzp14lWm-D7Gbqg\">@btsstan4life</a>, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mukQIa7QxtycVpKzMNjEMcA\">@jinniepeachxo</a>, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJYgzQf3SnKiGvarX8TAKZA\">@purpleheartsfortae</a>, @nari2220, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m-BlHCnpyZ3oVsNcwIcr1WA\">@k00kjals</a>, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mmUecdCXhJQ1A2GqmJ_65Vw\">@yasbts705</a>, @moxxie84, @breadcaaat, @kpopgirlbtssvt, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mmv-vuGCF6ZXLm0iGu0deMQ\">@kamibyul</a></p></p>",

Taking a deep breath in, you followed as well. When you walked in you could see all of the guys glaring at your boyfriend with distaste, tension strong in the air. Yet, as soon as you came into their line of sight, the glares softened, smiles gracing their faces, the air feeling light and happy once again. You nervously smiled back as you stood in between Yuna and Hyuk. Your boyfriend took your hand and the boys all lowly growled and glared at your joined hands. For some strange reason you didn&rsquo;t want to make them angry. You could pass it off as not wanting to offend them, but you knew you were just insecure of what they thought. So, not wanting to anger them any further, you tried to pull your hand out of Hyuk&rsquo;s grasp. Though this proved to be difficult as he just kept tightening his grip.</p><p>You cleared your throat, trying to lighten the mood, &ldquo;Hi.&rdquo; The sound of your voice seemed to calm the stiff hybrids. </p><p>The golden retriever, who you remember him introducing himself as &lsquo;Hobi&rsquo; stepped forward. &ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; he said brightly, his tail wagging back and forth in excitement. It was cute how excited he got when meeting new people and you couldn&rsquo;t help but to giggle. His ears twitched and his eyes lit up when he heard it.</p><p>\n\n&ldquo;Hello, thank you for coming back here,&rdquo; Namjoon said as he held his hand out to you. Shaking his hand, you smiled politely. As you let go of his hand, his smile somewhat left his face but he was quick to make it return before you could notice.&nbsp;</p><p><b></b></p><p>Jin grabbed your hand and kissed the back of it, &ldquo;Hello again beautiful.&rdquo; You could feel your cheeks burning as your eyes widened. Hearing Hyuk scoff, you were reminded of his presence and coughed awkwardly. Feeling his hold on your hand tighten, you glanced at him and saw him glaring with a frown on his face. Feelings of guilt slowly built up inside of you. Here you were allowing some guy to flirt with you in front of your boyfriend.</p><p>Namjoon cleared his throat, gesturing to the two couches in the corner of the room, &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t we sit?&rdquo;</p><p>The three of you followed behind them. You let go of your boyfriend&rsquo;s hand and sat down in the middle. Hyuk was about to sit by you, but Jimin beat him to it with Taehyung sitting on your other side. You looked apologetically to Hyuk as he huffed and sat on the other couch. Hoseok sat in front of you, leaning back on your legs. Jin sat on the other side of Taehyung with Jungkook choosing to sit by Jimin. The two remaining boys, Yoongi and Namjoon, sat on the floor either side of Hoseok. You knew without even looking that Hyuk was glaring at them all.</p><p>&ldquo;Would you like me to sit by you baby?&rdquo; you asked him as you went to get up. Having all of them sitting so close to you was becoming a little too overwhelming. Before you could fully stand, Jimin wrapped his tail around your waist and Taehyung put his arm around your shoulders&nbsp;while the rest of the boys growled.</p><p>Hyuk raised an eyebrow, &ldquo;Actually yeah, I would like it if my <i>girlfriend </i>would come sit by me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Aunt Y/n? Where can I sit?&rdquo; Yuna quietly ask you before a fight could break out. You were grateful she said something because you knew how bad Hyuk&rsquo;s anger could get and you also knew hybrids had intense instincts.</p><p>Before you could answer her, Jimin held his arms out to her, &ldquo;You can sit on my lap cutie!&rdquo; You heart skipped a beat as you saw him pull her onto his lap. He looked so adorable interacting with her. Yuna smiled big as she looked at him with admiration. He was her favorite after all.</p><p>&ldquo;Can I pet your ears?&rdquo; Yuna&rsquo;s question brought you out of your thoughts.</p><p>Your eyes widened, &ldquo;Yuna! You can&rsquo;t just ask that!&rdquo; You turned to Jimin as you apologized, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry Jimin-ssi.&rdquo; He just smiled at you and allowed Yuna to pet his ears. You smiled as he started purring, the sound relaxing you further.</p><p>Everyone broke off into their separate conversations. Jimin and Jungkook were talking to Yuna, while Namjoon and Hoseok were quietly whispering to each other, glancing at Hyuk every once in a while, and Yoongi was just sitting there silently. As you were talking to Jin and Taehyung, you could feel someone&rsquo;s eyes on you. Thinking it was Hyuk, you looked at him only to find out he was on his phone. Tilting your head to the side, you looked around the room to see who it was. Your breath hitched as soon as you made eye contact with Yoongi. His gaze held so much pain and regret that you had to avert your eyes. He let out a whimper and the noise caused everyone to look at the two of you.</p><p>&ldquo;Jagi..&rdquo; Yoongi&rsquo;s voice was quiet and he timidly put his hand on your knee. He let out another whimper when you flinched away from him. When tears gathered in his eyes, Hoseok put his arm around him.</p><p>Hyuk cleared his throat and crossed his arms, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like if you wouldn&rsquo;t call her Jagi. Only I can do that. Besides, she&rsquo;s <i>afraid</i> of you. Don&rsquo;t you remember?&rdquo; A smirk was present on his face as he looked Yoongi in the eyes. You couldn&rsquo;t believe what you were hearing. You knew Yoongi felt bad about what had happened and it angered you that Hyuk was being so inconsiderate. \n\n</p><p><b></b></p><p>You expected Yoongi to retaliate and start a fight, but were shocked to see him only tense up before leaving the room quickly, his tail wrapped around his waist and his ears down. It was strange to see him looking so vulnerable. Yuna had told you how he acts like he doesn&rsquo;t care, but you could also remember him saying how much of a softie he was. You were brought out of your thoughts when Hoseok follow him, sending a heated glare in your boyfriend&rsquo;s direction. For some strange reason, you felt your chest hurt when they left. Rubbing your chest lightly, you looked back to the rest of the group. The BTS members that remained looked at you knowingly. You were about to ask if Yoongi would be okay, but Hyuk spoke up.</p><p>&ldquo;Is he always such a baby?&rdquo; he snorted and smugly looked at the guys. They all growled at him, their tails swaying in anger, their eyes staring daggers at him.</p><p>Surprisingly it was Jungkook who spoke up, &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you shut the fuck up?</p><p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you make me <i>bunny</i>,&rdquo; Hyuk spat out at Jungkook and sniggered when all he did was take a deep breath and turn around. He chuckled at Jungkook&rsquo;s back, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I thought. Poor little shy bunny can&rsquo;t do shi-&rdquo; He was cut off by Jungkook&rsquo;s fist hitting his jaw. You gasped and covered your mouth as Jungkook fell on top of him, continuing to land punches on his face. Yuna started yelling and crying as the boys grabbed a hold of him and hauled him off of your boyfriend.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you okay?&rdquo; you asked as you ran over and helped him up off the floor. Yuna followed behind you and grabbed your hand tightly. Just then, Yoongi and Hoseok walked through the door into the room. The frigid atmosphere made them stop in their tracks and become on guard. Their sharp eyes quickly looked around the room to see what happened.</p><p>Hoseok was the one to break the stressful silence, &ldquo;Uh what happened here?&rdquo; No one uttered a single word, making you bit your lip anxiously. God, you didn&rsquo;t know what you would do if they all started fighting again. You especially didn&rsquo;t know how to feel now that Yoongi was back. On one hand you were excited he came back, but on the other hand you were slightly afraid. Yet somewhere deep down inside of you, you knew he would never intentionally hurt you.</p><p>Hyuk wiped his lip, looking up at Jungkook straight in the eyes, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re lucky you&rsquo;re in some famous band or else you&rsquo;d be <i>dead</i>.&rdquo; Your eyes became wide as you stared at him in disbelief. Was he stupid? Why was he threatening a famous person? A <i>hybrid </i>at that!</p><p>\n\n&ldquo;Y/n, why don&rsquo;t you take Yuna and go buy some merch? It&rsquo;s on us,&rdquo; Namjoon said as he waved over a security guard proceeding to tell him something all the while keeping his eyes locked on Hyuk. Said security guard nodded and led both you and Yuna out of the room. As soon as the door shut behind you, you could hear someone inside start yelling, other voices joining in. You could feel yourself start to panic, not wanting anyone to get hurt anymore.\n\n</p><p>Looking away from the door, you tightened your grip on Yuna&rsquo;s hand and followed the guard down a hallway. Once you guys got to the little store they had, you looked down at your niece, &ldquo;Okay Yuna, choose what you like and I&rsquo;ll get it for you sweetie.&rdquo; Yuna gasped and looked at you with shining eyes, excited to be able to get BTS merch. Like she always told you, you could never have too much.\n\n</p><p>&ldquo;Ma&rsquo;am, Mr. Kim said he would pay for it. So you don&rsquo;t have to worry about money,&rdquo; the security guard said as he held up a shiny, silver card. From what he had said you could tell it was Namjoon&rsquo;s credit card. </p><p>You put your hands out in front of you, stuttering slightly with eyes opened wide in disbelief, &ldquo;Oh! No thank you! I can pay for myself. He doesn&rsquo;t have to worry about paying for me haha..&rdquo; You trailed off as he tried to hand the credit card to you. Key word being tried as you quickly moved away from him. Walking over to where Yuna was looking at some t-shirts, you heard the man clear his throat. Pretending to not have heard him you stood next to your niece, &ldquo;So Yuna Tuna, what have you thought of getting?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s so much I wanna get, but I don&rsquo;t want to waste your money and Appa only gave me &#8361;50,000,&rdquo; Yuna pouted as she put the shirt back. In her arms she already held two shirts and a poster. You were about to reply, telling her she could get whatever and <i>you&rsquo;d </i>pay for it, but it seems like the security guard, who was starting to get on your nerves by the way, beat you to it. </p><p>He picked the t-shirt Yuna had previously put down back up and handed it to her, &ldquo;You can get this Ms. Yuna. Rm-ssi said he&rsquo;d buy it for you.&rdquo; </p><p>Okay, now he was <i>really </i>getting on your nerves. You scoffed, rolling your eyes at the man. Why didn&rsquo;t he get the hint you could pay for it? Actually, why did Namjoon think you couldn&rsquo;t pay for it? Did he pity you?</p><p>Yuna gasped and grabbed the piece of clothing from his hands, smiling up at him and then at you. Seeing her so excited made you soften your tight stance. You could always pay Namjoon back. Granted it might take you a while, especially after seeing how much Yuna was getting. So far, she had six shirts, two different tote bags, a headband, and another one of their CD&rsquo;s.</p><p>&ldquo;Yuna, don&rsquo;t get too much okay? It&rsquo;s not nice to spend all of someone&rsquo;s money,&rdquo; you said as you followed behind her.</p><p>She looked back at you as she put everything on the counter to be checked out, &ldquo;But Namjoon said I could get anything.&rdquo; A pout was present on her face as the cashier rang up her merchandise.</p><p>&ldquo;I know he did sweetie, but it&rsquo;s still not polite to spend people&rsquo;s money. It&rsquo;s always a good thing to be independent and not rely on someone,&rdquo; you voiced as pulled your wallet out. Just because Namjoon said they would pay for it didn&rsquo;t mean you weren&rsquo;t going to try and pay for it yourself. You were a strong and independent woman after all.</p><p>As you and the little girl had a stare off, the cashier had finished ringing the items up and cleared their throat, &ldquo;That&rsquo;ll be &#8361;170,000 please.&rdquo; The security guard handed the lady the credit card before you could whip yours out.</p><p>Huffing, you crossed your arms, slightly pouting, not knowing the rest of the boys were standing behind you. Someone coughed, making you turn around in shock. As you turned around, you swore you heard one of the boys mumble out the word &lsquo;cute&rsquo;. You waved awkwardly, completely embarrassed they had seen your small act.</p><p>&ldquo;Namjoon-sii! Thank you for letting me get all of this merch!&rdquo; Yuna bowed and looked up at him in admiration. You could tell just by looking at her interact with them how much she admired them and the thought made your heart swell. She was too cute for her own good.</p><p>While Yuna was talking to the boys, showing them what she got in the process, you walked over to stand next to your angry boyfriend. You leaned over and whispered in his ear, &ldquo;Hey baby, how are you doing?&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n&ldquo;How am I doing? Really? Are you really asking me that right now?&rdquo; he scoffed, shaking his head and shifting away from you. He didn&rsquo;t understand how you could be so idiotic at times. Like right now, how you were just letting them talk about your relationship with him and not even say anything was making his temper rise to dangerous levels.&nbsp;</p><p>Leaning away from him, you tried to hide the hurt shown on your face, &ldquo;I just wanted to make sure you were okay&hellip;&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;This is why she shouldn&rsquo;t be dating you. You treat her like shit,&rdquo; Jungkook&rsquo;s broke into the conversation. Jimin brought Yuna over to look at some of the posters and you silently thanked him. You really didn&rsquo;t want her to hear them fight. <i>Again</i>. </p><p>Hyuk looked the bunny hybrid in the eyes, &ldquo;Oh you really don&rsquo;t know when to shut your mouth bunny.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I told you not to fucking call me that,&rdquo; Jungkook spat at Hyuk, the rest of the boys, excluding Yoongi, tried to calm him down. Yoongi was just staring at you intensely. </p><p>&ldquo;Hyuk, you need to calm down,&rdquo; your voice was soft, trying to calm the agitated man. </p><p>He ripped his arm out of your grasp and shifted his glare to you, &ldquo;Do you not hear what they are saying right now Y/n? Are you really that fucking dumb?&rdquo; When all you could do was stare at him, he grew unnerved and raised his hand. You flinched, expecting to feel the sting, but was met with growling instead. There, stood in front of you, with Hyuk&rsquo;s wrist in his own hand, was Yoongi. Your heart skipped a beat. Yoongi. <i>He </i>stopped Hyuk from hitting you. </p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you <i>dare </i>lay a hand on her or I&rsquo;ll fucking break both of your hands,&rdquo; Yoongi&rsquo;s words were low, a threatening growl in the back of his throat. Your boyfriend went to raise his other hand, but was stopped by Hoseok grabbing it. </p><p>You walked around both Yoongi and Hoseok, voice quiet and a slight tremble to it, &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;d be best if we left. Thank you for allowing us backstage to hang out and thank you for buying Yuna things. I greatly appreciate it.&rdquo; Finishing your words, you bowed low and called Yuna over. </p><p>&ldquo;Wait, Y/n, can we at least get your phone number? We want to hang out some more&hellip;&rdquo; Jimin trailed off as he saw the look Hyuk was giving him. Saying yes meant you would disappoint your boyfriend&hellip;but saying no meant you&rsquo;d be hurting <i>seven </i>people. And you know what they say, majority always wins.</p><p>Glancing between both boys, you made up your mind, &ldquo;Of course you can Jimin-ssi.&rdquo; Hyuk&rsquo;s head snapped towards you, but you ignored it. It wasn&rsquo;t technically your fault. He was the one who got in a fight with them. Not you.&nbsp;Plus, you felt this certain pull making you want to get to know them even more. \n\n</p><p>Grabbing Jimin&rsquo;s phone, you typed in your number then handed it back to him. A few seconds later and your phone buzzed in your back pocket. You thought better and decided to take a look at it when Hyuk was asleep. Bidding them goodbye, you left behind Hyuk with Yuna&rsquo;s hand in your own. She happily skipped next to you, her purchases in her unoccupied hand.</p><p>&ndash;0&ndash;0&ndash;0&ndash;0&ndash;</p><p>The ride back to your apartment was silent and tense. You had tried to make conversation with Hyuk, but he just tightened his grip on the wheel, knuckles turning white. Taking the hint, you stayed silent and looked out the window. Your phone kept buzzing, so you pulled it out to see several messages from new numbers.</p><p><b>+820245674823: Hey Y/n-ah! It&rsquo;s Jimin! ^^</b></p><p><b>+820257609483: This is Hobi! </b></p><p><b>+820284763947: Hello, Y/n, it&rsquo;s Namjoon (:</b></p><p><b>+820248576930: Jungkookie is here!</b></p><p><b>+820274539274: Hello worldwide beautiful (;</b></p><p><b>+820247593294: Y/n!!! It&rsquo;s Tae ((::</b></p><p><b>+820284639292: Yoongi&hellip;</b></p><p><b></b></p><p>You smiled and saved their numbers in your contacts, frowning when you saw Yoongi&rsquo;s message. You could sense he still felt guilty towards what had happened and it made you sad. Opening a new chat, you typed out a message just to Yoongi.</p><p><b>You: Hey Yoongi-ssi, I wanted to tell you that what happened today isn&rsquo;t a big deal. I forgive you and hope we can be friends in the future! ^.^</b></p><p>Remembering you left the others on read, you quickly answered them.</p><p><b>You: Hey guys! It&rsquo;s Y/n ;;</b></p><p><b>Jiminie: Y/n!</b></p><p><b>Namjoonie: (:</b></p><p><b>Kookie: Do you play any games?</b></p><p><b>Hobi Hobi~: Hi cutie! </b></p><p><b>TaeTae: If you do let&rsquo;s get together and play!!</b></p><p>Hearing Hyuk scoff, you quickly answered Taehyung and Jungkook. Afterwards you silenced your phone and put it away. As soon as you got home, you picked up a sleeping Yuna and brought her into your guest room. You placed her on the bed, tucking her in, and giving her a light kiss to the forehead. Back in the living room you saw Hyuk sitting there on the couch. </p><p>When he saw you come in, he stood up and crossed his arms, &ldquo;So. Let&rsquo;s have a talk, <i>shall we</i>?&rdquo; You gulped and slowly sat down, him joining you although a distance was between you. </p><p>\n\n&ldquo;What do you want to talk about?&rdquo; you quietly spoke, afraid talking too loud would anger him even more and wake Yuna up. As much as you didn&rsquo;t want to talk about today, you knew you had to. Especially if you didn&rsquo;t want Hyuk to break up with you. You had spent so much time with him and you did truly love him.</p><p>He scoffed and gave you a burning gaze, &ldquo;Oh I don&rsquo;t know maybe about how you stayed silent when they were shit talking our relationship?&rdquo; When you didn&rsquo;t say anything, he continued, &ldquo;Or do you wanna talk about how you apparently almost <i>kissed </i>one of them? Hmm?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to. We were just staring at each other and next thing I knew we were both leaning in&hellip;&rdquo; trailing off towards the end, you gazed at the coffee table suddenly imagining what it would have felt like to actually feel Jimin&rsquo;s lips on your own&hellip; </p><p>&ldquo;Damn it Y/n! Stop daydreaming about them!&rdquo; Hyuk&rsquo;s loud voice made you jump, not even realizing you had stopped listening to him. </p><p>You looked down at your clasped hands, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t get why you&rsquo;re so mad..&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Are-Are you fucking serious? Tell me you&rsquo;re joking,&rdquo; he was getting louder and louder the more the conversation dragged on. You could tell he was fuming and you really did want to calm him down, but sometimes you just didn&rsquo;t know what to say. And right now was one of them as all you could get out was a small &lsquo;uhh..&rsquo;</p><p>He stood up abruptly and started pacing, &ldquo;I swear to God you&rsquo;re so fucking dumb sometimes! They were blatantly telling us we don&rsquo;t belong together! And all you did was stand there and act like they weren&rsquo;t being complete assholes!&rdquo; He was almost yelling at this point. It was when you were once again not paying him any attention that he finally did yell, &ldquo;Again! You&rsquo;re not listening to me again!&rdquo; </p><p>\n\n&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry&hellip;&rdquo; you said it so quietly he almost didn&rsquo;t hear you. You hated when anyone so much as raised their voice at you, so hearing him yell at you made you extra quiet and cautious.&nbsp;</p><p>\n\nHe slammed his hand down on your coffee table, causing you to jump. Tears started welling up in your eyes as you thought back to when he was going to hit you. Was he going to try again? And if he did what were you going to do? No one was here to stop him. Sure, he had yelled at you and verbally abused you when he was really fired up, but never has he tried to physically hurt you. Maybe it was best if you never talked to the members of BTS if it meant he wouldn&rsquo;t hit you&hellip;&nbsp;</p><p>\n\n&ldquo;Hyuk,&rdquo; your voice rang louder and steadier than you anticipated, but it had gained his attention. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry for everything that happened tonight. I promise I won&rsquo;t talk to them at all,&rdquo; you continued as you pulled your phone out of your back pocket. You blamed it on the guilt you were feeling, but you knew you were in fact just scared of what he could possibly do. Pulling up the groupchat, you typed out two simple sentences.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Y/n: I&rsquo;m sorry, but I think it&rsquo;d be best if we forgot we ever met. Please, never contact me again. </b></p><p>Hyuk sighed as he sat down beside you, &ldquo;Thank you. That&rsquo;s all I wanted baby. You&rsquo;re doing the right thing. Now, let&rsquo;s go to bed. Okay?&rdquo; He kissed your head and walked off to your bedroom, with you trailing slowly behind. If you were doing the right thing, why did your heart hurt so much?</p><p>Tag List:</p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m0xlEzF31DDa0fN64pj-LVg\">@child-ofthe-moon-and-leaves</a>, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJR34GwkPsmybwJPP-Ism7Q\">@chari-a</a>, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mDgROAbdWbF3odtSgGHHCHQ\">@cjisluckycharm</a>, @huhuehuey, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_IswLp8Nh3qYkfo9uxTXAQ\">@childfmoonn</a>, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mUvVK503Q85wBLDiS5znVUA\">@goldenkookss</a>, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mdEEBFBbu511fEDrNizCDpg\">@jiminsreina</a>, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mbZHGrbNd9LTamoCuFZ-nKw\">@i-am-canada-13</a>, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mXnuEdcyIaJOfNgvehhtA6A\">@eilowyneleyne</a>, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m7GMHwUBJTFTZtEI2sFahMA\">@2seokkyo</a>, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mnslOkmdy8fKmKEy_LjCo3A\">@lokathefemale</a>, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mRSgvA0581tpJLmYOUADxFw\">@raja-in-demigodishness</a>, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mZAEPzW57lykuMCPo8xD9ZQ\">@shelley-hennig14</a>, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJ1hCquuvFJSe2y2-KnDmxw\">@theshiningmoonsblog</a>, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfUOiXgX0RSFW_H7x9sYuPg\">@agoddesswithablade</a>, @the-argus-eyed, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mWr0d1J_Mzp14lWm-D7Gbqg\">@btsstan4life</a>, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mukQIa7QxtycVpKzMNjEMcA\">@jinniepeachxo</a>, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJYgzQf3SnKiGvarX8TAKZA\">@purpleheartsfortae</a>, @nari2220, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m-BlHCnpyZ3oVsNcwIcr1WA\">@k00kjals</a>, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mmUecdCXhJQ1A2GqmJ_65Vw\">@yasbts705</a>, @moxxie84, @breadcaaat, @kpopgirlbtssvt, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mmv-vuGCF6ZXLm0iGu0deMQ\">@kamibyul</a></p></p>",

Taking a deep breath in, you followed as well. When you walked in you could see all of the guys glaring at your boyfriend with distaste, tension strong in the air. Yet, as soon as you came into their line of sight, the glares softened, smiles gracing their faces, the air feeling light and happy once again. You nervously smiled back as you stood in between Yuna and Hyuk. Your boyfriend took your hand and the boys all lowly growled and glared at your joined hands. For some strange reason you didn&rsquo;t want to make them angry. You could pass it off as not wanting to offend them, but you knew you were just insecure of what they thought. So, not wanting to anger them any further, you tried to pull your hand out of Hyuk&rsquo;s grasp. Though this proved to be difficult as he just kept tightening his grip.</p>\n<p>You cleared your throat, trying to lighten the mood, &ldquo;Hi.&rdquo; The sound of your voice seemed to calm the stiff hybrids. </p>\n<p>The golden retriever, who you remember him introducing himself as &lsquo;Hobi&rsquo; stepped forward. &ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; he said brightly, his tail wagging back and forth in excitement. It was cute how excited he got when meeting new people and you couldn&rsquo;t help but to giggle. His ears twitched and his eyes lit up when he heard it.</p>\n<p>\n\n&ldquo;Hello, thank you for coming back here,&rdquo; Namjoon said as he held his hand out to you. Shaking his hand, you smiled politely. As you let go of his hand, his smile somewhat left his face but he was quick to make it return before you could notice.&nbsp;</p>\n</p>",
