The first three episodes all set Tyrion up as having\u00a0\u201cdivided loyalties\u201d as Sansa said, between his family and between his queen (Daenerys). His faith and his desire to be accepted by his family is tragic. Even after he killed his father, Cersei\u2019s tried to kill him, tried to kill Shae, always hated and feared him, after his father hurt him through his first wife even if the show cut Tysha and I\u2019m still mad about it&ndash;he still tries to plead with Cersei. Like, we all know Cersei won\u2019t listen to reason. But he tries because he desperately wants his family to accept him. He wants to forgive himself like Jaime struggles to do, for killing their father in Tyrion\u2019s case, for killing Shae. As abusive as Tywin was, killing him and Shae devastated Tyrion.\u00a0</p><p>Also, Peter Dinklage made some curious (but not definitive) comments about falling in love with Dany, and the season 6 and 7 scripts appear to confirm that Tyrion is in love with Daenerys (<a href=\"https://www.radiotimes.com/news/tv/2019-03-20/game-of-thrones-season-8-tyrion-loves-daenerys-jon-snow/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/game-thrones-script-tyrion-daenerys-love/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>).

I think, like Jaime, he will try to save what he loves&ndash;his family (Cersei and Jaime, if he sees Jaime\u2019s come back) and Daenerys. And because of that it\u2019s likely to be a tragedy. Because sometimes you do have to choose. It might also echo Ned\u2019s tragic way of trying to show mercy on Cersei only to have that backfire and wind up executed again (I\u2019m guessing Tyrion\u2019s execution would mimic Ned\u2019s).\u00a0</p><p>Again, <i>if</i>.

Filmmaking 101.</p><p>I think she&rsquo;s going to prove everyone wrong once the battle starts because there will be a lot of questioning and tension in Dragonstone at the beginning. She will take out Euron and the scorpions, well as many as she can and then open fire on the KL gates.</p><p>There will be a battle and it might seem like things are stacked against them, and then Golden Company turns their cloaks and starts fighting for Daenerys</p><p>I think Cersei is the one that will start behaving recklessly after the bells start to toll, perhaps using the people in the Keep as a shield against Daenerys and threatening lives, perhaps even killing people</p><p>I think Tyrion will try to save his sister and his brother&rsquo;s child, but he will pay the ultimate price for it&hellip; his conscience, because he&rsquo;ll have to keep Dany&rsquo;s armies back</p><p>I think Jaime is going to prove essential in taking out Cersei in the end</p><p>I think Arya will mercy-kill the Hound after he&rsquo;s done with the Mountain</p><p>\n\nI think they will set off a bunch of bombs in the Red Keep and many people will lose their lives cause they can&rsquo;t get out</p><p>\n\nI think both Targaryens will abdicate after the horrifying scenes in Kingslanding, cause their home is not the IT, it&rsquo;s their family (each other)<br /></p><p>\n\nI think Daenerys is pregnant<br /></p><p>Narratively, this is what SHOULD happen.</p>",
