She took a gasping breath, trying to sit up. She was on a helicopter. </p><p>&ldquo;Stay still.&rdquo; Sam murmured from somewhere outside of her line of vision. She twisted her head around to see him sitting in a chair, his arms strapped down and his wrists cuffed together. She spotted Scott Lang, Wanda, and Clint sitting next to him, restrained in similar ways. </p><p>Jet opened her mouth to say something but Sam shook his head. </p><p>&ldquo;Shhh.&rdquo; Sam whispered. Jet nodded and she drifted back to sleep. </p><p>When she woke back up,  someone was carrying her. She tried to move, but her body screamed in pain. She opened her eyes and saw it was an armed guard carrying her. Sam walked in front of her, lead by another guard. </p><p>&ldquo;Sir, she&rsquo;s awake.&rdquo; The guard carrying her said as they entered a white room. Her friends were led to separate cells and the doors were locked. </p><p>&ldquo;Get her restrained.&rdquo; Sergeant Ross ordered. Two other guards walked forward and grabbed hold of Jet&rsquo;s arms as the other carrying her set her down. With no intent of being gentle, the guards held her still as her wrists were cuffed together and her ankles were chained. </p><p>A black strap was wrapped around her shoulders and tightened around her wings. She let out a cry as she felt her bones crack under the restraint. Another strap went around her waist and tightened around the bottom part of her wings. </p><p>&ldquo;Let her go! You&rsquo;re hurting her!&rdquo; Sam shouted from his cell, banging a fist against the glass. </p><p>&ldquo;Take her to the lab.&rdquo; Ross instructed. Jet was dragged from the cell block as she struggled against her restraints. </p><p>&ldquo;Let me go!&rdquo; She screamed. She locked eyes with Sam just before the doors closed. </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be okay, Jet!&rdquo; He called after her. But both of them highly doubted that. </p><p>***</p><p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Jet?&rdquo; Tony asked, his eyes wandering\u00a0 around the cell block. There was one empty cell next to Clint and Wanda.

A guard had a tight hold on Jet&rsquo;s arm, pulling her into the room. She was still bruised and bloodied from the battle even though that was over a week ago. Her wrists were cuffed and a long chain connected them to her ankles, which were also cuffed. Her wings were forcibly folded tightly against her back and held down with two thick black straps. </p><p>The guard forced her down into the chair across from Tony.

This isn&rsquo;t what I had in mind.&rdquo; Tony explained. Jet scoffed and sat back, but winced as her wings made contact with the back of the chair. </p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help you if you don&rsquo;t tell me what they did.&rdquo; Tony added quieter. He could see the exhaustion in Jet&rsquo;s eyes, as if she hadn&rsquo;t slept since she got here. And she was thinner, not by much, since she was already a rail, but Tony could tell. </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s more like what they haven&rsquo;t done.&rdquo; Jet said. Tony nodded for her to continue. Jet sighed. </p><p>&ldquo;My wings are broken. And they won&rsquo;t allow me to stretch them out. Any longer with them held down by these straps and they&rsquo;ll heal wrong.

His fists were clenched and his face held a permanent glare. The second his doors opened, he swore he would kill every last person who hurt the winged girl. Jet sighed. </p><p>&ldquo;Nothing this time.&rdquo; She whispered back. &ldquo;Tony wanted to see me.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Stark&rsquo;s here?&rdquo; Sam spat. He was the reason Jet was even in this mess. Jet merely nodded. </p><p>&ldquo;What did he want?&rdquo; Clint asked, leaning against the glass. Jet shrugged slightly, not wanting the camera&rsquo;s to hear what Tony was actually doing. Clint didn\u2019t press for information, pushing himself off the glass and sitting down on his bed. Sam remained standing, pacing back and forth.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d Wanda asked. Jet looked over to the other girl\u2019s cell block. She looked tired and her hair hung limp against her shoulders. Like Jet, Wanda remained bound. The others were free to roam around their cells, while Wanda was restricted in a straight jacket. Jet would\u2019ve worn a straight jacket too, only it didn\u2019t fit over her wings.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay.\u201d Jet responded. Wanda sent her a pointed look.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re not.\u201d She said. Jet didn\u2019t say anything, pulling herself up onto her bed and laying down on her side.

Jet told me as much.\u201d Ross held his hands up in surrender.</p><p>\u201cAlright, alright. We may have done a few blood tests, but that\u2019t all!\u201d He said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m willing to strike a deal with you, Ross. So that Jet can go free, and you won\u2019t have to worry about her acting out again.\u201d Tony said, sitting down.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019d you have in mind?\u201d</p><p>***</p><p>Jet woke up with a start as her cell door was being unlocked. Sitting up, she cowered in the corner of her bed, hoping that maybe this once, they weren\u2019t going to hurt her. The door swung open and Tony stood there.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cCome on, kid.

This isn\u2019t what I had in mind.\u201d Tony explained. Jet scoffed and sat back, but winced as her wings made contact with the back of the chair. </p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t help you if you don\u2019t tell me what they did.\u201d Tony added quieter. He could see the exhaustion in Jet\u2019s eyes, as if she hadn\u2019t slept since she got here. And she was thinner, not by much, since she was already a rail, but Tony could tell. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s more like what they haven\u2019t done.\u201d Jet said. Tony nodded for her to continue. Jet sighed. </p><p>\u201cMy wings are broken. And they won\u2019t allow me to stretch them out. Any longer with them held down by these straps and they\u2019ll heal wrong. Then I\u2019ll be in pain for the rest of my life. And I\u2019m covered in injuries that they refuse to look at.\u201d </p><p>Tony sat forward, knowing there was something more. </p><p>\u201cBut they <i>have </i>done<i> </i>something<i>. </i>Haven\u2019t they?\u201d He pressed. Jet squirmed under his stare and nodded slightly. </p><p>\u201cThey do\u2026experiments\u2026 try to test my limits. Since I\u2019m a scientific breakthrough and all.\u201d </p><p>\u201cSteve sent me a message. To make sure you\u2019re safe. And I intend to do that.\u201d</p><p>***</p><p>Jet was escorted back to her cell block, where she was unceremoniously pushed to the ground and the door was locked before she could even sit up. </p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019d they do this time?\u201d Sam asked from his cell. His fists were clenched and his face held a permanent glare. The second his doors opened, he swore he would kill every last person who hurt the winged girl. Jet sighed. </p><p>\u201cNothing this time.\u201d She whispered back. \u201cTony wanted to see me.\u201d </p><p>\u201cStark\u2019s here?\u201d Sam spat. He was the reason Jet was even in this mess. Jet merely nodded. </p><p>\u201cWhat did he want?\u201d Clint asked, leaning against the glass. Jet shrugged slightly, not wanting the camera\u2019s to hear what Tony was actually doing. Clint didn\u2019t press for information, pushing himself off the glass and sitting down on his bed. Sam remained standing, pacing back and forth.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d Wanda asked. Jet looked over to the other girl\u2019s cell block. She looked tired and her hair hung limp against her shoulders. Like Jet, Wanda remained bound. The others were free to roam around their cells, while Wanda was restricted in a straight jacket. Jet would\u2019ve worn a straight jacket too, only it didn\u2019t fit over her wings.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay.\u201d Jet responded. Wanda sent her a pointed look.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re not.\u201d She said. Jet didn\u2019t say anything, pulling herself up onto her bed and laying down on her side. She drifted into an uneasy sleep, her body screaming in pain.\u00a0</p><p>***</p><p>Tony tapped his fingers against the metal table impatiently waiting for Secretary Ross. The gray haired man walked in and Tony stood up.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI want you to release Jet.\u201d He demanded.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a criminal. Along with everyone else here.\u201d Ross answered, shutting the door.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a child!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t change anything.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThat still doesn\u2019t constitute experimentation.\u201d Tony said through clenched teeth.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t done any-\u201d Tony slammed his fist against the table.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t lie to me! Jet told me as much.\u201d Ross held his hands up in surrender.</p><p>\u201cAlright, alright. We may have done a few blood tests, but that\u2019t all!\u201d He said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m willing to strike a deal with you, Ross. So that Jet can go free, and you won\u2019t have to worry about her acting out again.\u201d Tony said, sitting down.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019d you have in mind?\u201d</p><p>***</p><p>Jet woke up with a start as her cell door was being unlocked. Sitting up, she cowered in the corner of her bed, hoping that maybe this once, they weren\u2019t going to hurt her. The door swung open and Tony stood there.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cCome on, kid. You\u2019re getting out of here.\u201d\u00a0</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"chat\"}'><b>Tag list:</b></p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"chat\"}'><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mzkHVHez-Jq1sgJR7P5LbJQ\">@ginger-elf-queen</a> </p>",

She took a gasping breath, trying to sit up. She was on a helicopter. </p><p>&ldquo;Stay still.&rdquo; Sam murmured from somewhere outside of her line of vision. She twisted her head around to see him sitting in a chair, his arms strapped down and his wrists cuffed together. She spotted Scott Lang, Wanda, and Clint sitting next to him, restrained in similar ways. </p><p>Jet opened her mouth to say something but Sam shook his head. </p><p>&ldquo;Shhh.&rdquo; Sam whispered. Jet nodded and she drifted back to sleep. </p><p>When she woke back up,  someone was carrying her. She tried to move, but her body screamed in pain. She opened her eyes and saw it was an armed guard carrying her. Sam walked in front of her, lead by another guard. </p><p>&ldquo;Sir, she&rsquo;s awake.&rdquo; The guard carrying her said as they entered a white room. Her friends were led to separate cells and the doors were locked. </p><p>&ldquo;Get her restrained.&rdquo; Sergeant Ross ordered. Two other guards walked forward and grabbed hold of Jet&rsquo;s arms as the other carrying her set her down. With no intent of being gentle, the guards held her still as her wrists were cuffed together and her ankles were chained. </p><p>A black strap was wrapped around her shoulders and tightened around her wings. She let out a cry as she felt her bones crack under the restraint. Another strap went around her waist and tightened around the bottom part of her wings. </p><p>&ldquo;Let her go! You&rsquo;re hurting her!&rdquo; Sam shouted from his cell, banging a fist against the glass. </p><p>&ldquo;Take her to the lab.&rdquo; Ross instructed. Jet was dragged from the cell block as she struggled against her restraints. </p><p>&ldquo;Let me go!&rdquo; She screamed. She locked eyes with Sam just before the doors closed. </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be okay, Jet!&rdquo; He called after her. But both of them highly doubted that. </p><p>***</p><p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Jet?&rdquo; Tony asked, his eyes wandering&nbsp; around the cell block. There was one empty cell next to Clint and Wanda. Tony turned back to Sam, whose held tilted to the side, his arms crossed.</p><p>&ldquo;Where do you think?&rdquo; Sam snapped. &ldquo;Do you really think that they&rsquo;d leave a scientific marvel like her alone?&rdquo; Tony&rsquo;s face paled. </p><p>&ldquo;I told them not to touch her.&rdquo; He said, feeling like he was trying to reassure himself more than Sam. </p><p>&ldquo;And yet where were you when we were all forced to watch them tie her wings down and drag her to the lab, listening to her screaming the whole way.&rdquo; Tony didn&rsquo;t speak so Sam continued, &ldquo;we told her she would be fine. That even though we were caught, you wouldn&rsquo;t let a 15 year old girl get locked up. But I guess we misjudged you.&rdquo;</p><p>***</p><p>Tony sat alone in a dimly lit room, his arms crossed as he anxiously tapped his foot. The door opened and he looked up. A guard had a tight hold on Jet&rsquo;s arm, pulling her into the room. She was still bruised and bloodied from the battle even though that was over a week ago. Her wrists were cuffed and a long chain connected them to her ankles, which were also cuffed. Her wings were forcibly folded tightly against her back and held down with two thick black straps. </p><p>The guard forced her down into the chair across from Tony. Without a nod to Tony, the guard left, closing the door behind him. Tony sighed and locked eyes with Jet. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey kid.&rdquo; He whispered. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey.&rdquo; She answered, breaking their eye contact and looking down. </p><p>&ldquo;What did they do to you?&rdquo; He asked. Jet, without moving her head, looked over to the camera in the upper corner of the room. Tony smirked. </p><p>&ldquo;I hacked the system. Muted the audio and looped the footage.&rdquo; Jet looked up at him. </p><p>&ldquo;Then they&rsquo;ll come back in here.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Bolted the door. Now tell me, what have they done?&rdquo; Tony pressed. </p><p>&ldquo;Why would you care?&rdquo; Jet spat, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re the one who got me locked up in the first place.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I told them to keep you safe.
