It must have been the milk she&rsquo;d drunk earlier that morning, or maybe the microwaved dinner from last night. But it didn&rsquo;t matter now, the important thing was that her famous boss, whom she&rsquo;d never actually met before, was waiting in the recording studio, while she was throwing up in this bathroom stall.</i></p><p><i>With her head spinning in circle, however, Y/N could still make out a knock on the door.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Hey, ya alright?&rdquo;<br /></i></p><p><i>She should&rsquo;ve recognized that British voice because she&rsquo;d spent the entire night before watching his interviews on Youtube to get to know him better. Nonetheless, in a situation like this her memory was helpless.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine&hellip;Thanks.&rdquo; Y/N groaned as she flushed the toilet before rising up from the floor, feeling a bit better but still quite unsure.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Sir, I don&rsquo;t think you should be in the ladies&rsquo; room,&rdquo; she told the man on the other side of the door.</i></p><p><i>And to her surprise, he replied with a laugh.&nbsp;</i><i>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m in the men&rsquo;s room.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Y/N&rsquo;s bloodshot eyes grew wide the moment she heard those words. She pulled the door open in an instant, then almost fell backward when she found Harry Styles standing right in front of her. Harry</i><i>&nbsp;gave the girl a friendly smile, yet when he opened his mouth to speak, she immediately turned away and got back down on her knees to empty her stomach in the toilet bowl.</i></p><p><i>In the haze, Y/N could feel Harry kneeling down by her side, gently holding her hair back so it wouldn&rsquo;t get in the way.

Looking around, you note that you&rsquo;re laying on the leather backseat of a random car in what appears to be a McDonald&rsquo;s drive-thru. The sun shining brightly outside is a good indicator that you&rsquo;ve been passed out for quite sometime, and that leads you to finally move your gaze to the person who has caused this entire predicament. </p><p>In the driver&rsquo;s seat of the car Harry mindlessly taps his fingers against the steering wheel, and loudly sings along to the lyrics of &lsquo;Mr. Brightside&rsquo; as the chorus starts. He&rsquo;s in his own little world as he moves forward in the line, awaiting his turn to pay for his order and drive off; and unsurprisingly he hasn't\u00a0noticed that you&rsquo;ve awoken.</p><p>You crack your stiff neck, as you slowly sit up and try your best not to start yelling at him. Your eyes remain locked on your curly haired best friend as he belts out the words of the song without flaw, and you pounce; wrapping your arm around his neck, and pulling him aggressively back against the carseat. &ldquo;You ASSHOLE!&rdquo; You growl, and glare into the rearview mirror so your eyes can lock with his. &ldquo;As if you snapped my neck on me <i>again. </i>That&rsquo;s low, even for you Harry.&rdquo; He struggles against you, but you just continue choking him with ease.\u00a0</p><p>You begin thinking you&rsquo;ve gotten the upper hand against him, but are greatly mistaken as he reaches back to grab ahold of you, and flips you over into the passenger seat; causing your butt to miss it completely as you fall down between the dash and car seat, onto the floor. </p><!-- more --><p>&ldquo;Are you <i>insane</i>?&rdquo; He hisses. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s people watching, Y/N. Calm the hell down.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ask if I give a shit,&rdquo; you seethe, as you struggle to get yourself unstuck from the awkward position you&rsquo;re in. &ldquo;As soon as I get out of this&hellip; you&rsquo;re- you&rsquo;re-.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m what?&rdquo; He asks with a chuckle, enjoying watching you struggle. He leaves you be as he pulls up to the window, and the poor cashier looks completely taken aback by the scene in front of her. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s having a bit of a rough go,&rdquo; he tells the girl casually as you finally pull yourself onto the seat in an upright position. She just nods awkwardly and hands him the food, clearly not wanting to deal with any of this. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey,&rdquo; you say to the girl, and lean over across Harry to get a better look at her. &ldquo;Call the cops, this man is kidnapping me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Have a good day!&rdquo; Harry yells cheerily to cut you off, before rolling up the tinted window, and ripping out of the parking lot. You glare at him, as you let out numerous groans and huffs, all while trying to get comfy in the seat&hellip; only severely disappointed with the fact he has the child lock on, and you can&rsquo;t escape. &ldquo;Are you done?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; you state, and turn the volume of the stereo right down; trying to contain your annoyance with every little thing at the moment. </p><p>&ldquo;What- this is one of your favourite songs,&rdquo; he replies disbelieving as he turns the stereo back up. </p><p>&ldquo;Do I look like I&rsquo;m in the mood for The Killers right now?&rdquo; You snap, and he just laughs. &ldquo;Now where the hell are we?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ok first off,&rdquo; he starts and raises an eyebrow at you. &ldquo;M'sorry for snapping your neck, but we wouldn&rsquo;t even be out of New York if I didn&rsquo;t. Second, we&rsquo;re almost in Toronto.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Toronto</i>?&rdquo; You gasp, and glance out the window at the Canadian scenery. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been asleep for that long?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah I was just thinking that actually,&rdquo; he states. &ldquo;Y'know, before you <i>attacked</i> me. But eight hours is a long time, is everything alright with you? You should\u2019ve healed faster than that.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t had much blood other than what you gave me last night,&rdquo; you tell him and crack your neck again. </p><p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; he nods in understanding. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get you some as soon as we stop.&rdquo; You nod in agreement, and slowly move your gaze back out the window; letting the worry some thoughts slowly creep into your mind.</p><p>\u201cHarry?\u201d You ask quietly, knowing he\u2019ll be able to hear you. Without looking at him, you take a nervous breath; feeling his gaze burn into you as he waits for you to continue. \u201cWhat if he finds us?\u201d</p><p>He\u00a0doesn\u2019t respond right away, but rather reaches across to gently grab ahold of your hand. His gesture catches you off guard, but you can\u2019t help the small smile the forms on your lips as he rubs his thumb over your knuckles.\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he tells you honestly.\u00a0\u201cBut I know we\u2019ll be ok in the end, regardless of what happens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what makes you so sure?\u201d You ask curiously.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m pretty positive he\u2019s not wanting to just have a nice chat with us after what happened two-hundred years ago, you know?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cWell I can agree with that statement based on when I had that run-in with him, as well as the goons he sent after us,\u201d he replies, and you bite down on your bottom lip.\u00a0\u201cBut we\u2019ve also made it through the last two centuries together. Despite all the odds, we\u2019re still here&hellip; Somehow.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d you agree with a small laugh.\u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s when we became best friends.\u00a0Who knew we\u2019d still be stuck with each other after all this time though? I mean, even as humans; no one wanted us to be together. Hell, everyone and their dog seemingly tried to keep us apart, but damn we were stubborn.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cWe really were,\u201d he chuckles, and nods his head.\u00a0\u201cStill don&rsquo;t know what caused you to make a move on me in the first place. I mean, yes we were close but&hellip;\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d You ask incredulously, and smack his arm.\u00a0\u201cIf\u00a0I&rsquo;m not mistaken, you were the one who would send me suggestive glances first, and weren&rsquo;t <i>you</i> the one to pull <i>me</i>\u00a0into the shadows as I was going up the estate\u2019s staircase to bed; before pushing me up against the wall and kissing me.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cOk you got me there,\u201d he says with an eye-roll, a smirk stretching across his mouth.\u00a0\u201cNot my fault though, you just showed up out of the blue. I remember I had worked for that dick for almost a year before you arrived that chilly February day, m\u2019birthday actually. The sight of you climbing out of that horse carriage with your hair all done up, and wearing that ridiculous Victorian dress. I&rsquo;ll never forget it.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cI <i>hated</i> those dresses,\u201d you state dramatically.\u00a0\u201cI remember my father telling me how dressed up I needed to be to meet Nathan, seeing as he was prospected to be my suitor. And even on my first day there I could tell how awful of a person he was, just with the way he treated the people working for or even just around him. How he acted so rude and abusive towards you, and the other\u2019s&hellip; It was disgusting.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cWhich is why it was such a breathe of fresh air when you arrived,\u201d he continues.\u00a0\u201cAll of us adored you, Y/N. Even though we were the\u00a0\u2018help,\u2019 in the in the months you stayed there, you treated us like human beings rather than objects just there for your disposal like Nathan did. Didn&rsquo;t take me long to fall in love with you, despite the others warning me of what would happen if Nathan ever found out. Still can\u2019t believe you even gave me a chance.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cYou underestimate yourself,\u201d you tell him, and look back out the window to see the Toronto skyline appearing in the distance.\u00a0\u201cI could never fall for someone so heartless and cruel like Nathan. You made me feel&hellip; wired, and full of excitement. Like I could finally live a bit of my life the way I wanted too, rather than how my father had planned out for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why it didn&rsquo;t take much convincing for you to sneak around with me, isn&rsquo;t it?\u201d He asks, and you nod your head.</p><p>\u201cYep,\u201d you confirm with a laugh.\u00a0\u201cAlthough it took you long enough to make the first move&hellip; But, I can only imagine where we\u2019d be if we didn&rsquo;t do any of that though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon&rsquo;t do that,\u201d he says firmly, and squeezes your hand so you\u2019ll look at him.\u00a0\u201cWe loved each other, Y/N. Although they didn\u2019t necessarily agree with what we were doing; everyone called us soulmates, and it\u2019s not on us that what happened, happened. It\u2019s on Nathan. He couldn\u2019t stand the thought of me having something he wanted so badly, and it was disgusting how he treated you like a trophy. My heart broke each time I saw the two of you together, and I wanted nothing more than to just walk up and pull you away from him; but I couldn\u2019t. I knew what would happen if I did, and knew that just wasn&rsquo;t an option&hellip; And then he found out about us anyways.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cYeah&hellip;\u201d You trail off, and look down.\u00a0\u201cWe really did love each other, didn&rsquo;t we? And then Nathan basically locked me in my room after finding out. Moved the wedding up to Halloween, and then that wonderful night came along. Now look at us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a couple of <i>wandering souls</i>,\u201d\u00a0he states with a smirk, knowing he\u2019d get a reaction out of you with that being what he called the two of you as humans.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cWith no where to go,\u201d you finish the statement, and roll your eyes at his cheesiness.\u00a0\u201cNow can we please stop talking about the past, it\u2019s bumming me out.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cThe past is catching up with us, Y/N,\u201d he tells you with a sigh.\u00a0\u201cThere\u2019s not much we can do to avoid it.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cWe can try,\u201d you whisper, and go back to silently looking out the window for the remainder of the ride into Toronto.\u00a0<br/></p><p>A couple of hours go by, and the two of you are now settled into a hotel room right downtown. You haven\u2019t said much else about the whole Nathan topic, but naturally that has to change.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI think we should come up with some sort of plan,\u201d Harry speaks up from the chair in the corner of the room, as you emerge from the washroom in a towel after showering. He looks you up and down, and you smirk cockily; thinking about what happened between the two of you last night.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat for?\u201d You ask cluelessly in attempt to get a rise out of him.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cY/N, Nathan could be right behind us for all we know,\u201d he snaps.<br/></p><p>\u201cI know, Harry,\u201d you yell right back.\u00a0\u201cBut it\u2019s also doubtful, Nathan wouldn\u2019t make himself known unless he needed too. Which I think is why he didn\u2019t show up last night, he wasn&rsquo;t nearby.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cOr I just got us out of there before he could show up,\u201d your best friend murmurs to himself, causing you to groan.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d you snark, and move to the bag of clothes Harry stuffed full for you upon rushing out of your apartment.\u00a0\u201cWe should go grab a couple of drinks, have some fun, y\u2019know? It\u2019d beat staying around here stressing out all night.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>A cool breeze whips around, and you don\u2019t even have to turn around to know that Harry is now behind you.\u00a0\u201cWe could have some fun here,\u201d he suggests, and leans down to brush his lips against your neck; placing his hands on your hips.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to the blood we talked about getting upon arriving here?\u201d You ask smugly, and turn around to face him; allowing him to gently push you up against the wall.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWe could still get it,\u201d he replies, and speeds the two of you over to the bed so your back is on the mattress, as he hovers over you.\u00a0\u201cIn a little bit though.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cToo bad I\u2019m <i>starving</i>,\u201d you tease as he begins placing love bites all along your collarbone once again.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cMe too,\u201d he states, before moving his mouth to meet yours.\u00a0\u201cBut not just for blood.\u201d<br/></p><p>You kiss him back, but use your vampire abilities to quickly flip the two of you so you\u2019re above him; letting the towel fall slightly so it\u2019s the only thing separating your two\u2019s bodies pressed together.\u00a0\u201cDon\u2019t you get sick of this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSick of what?\u201d He asks, and runs his fingers along your exposed skin; tracing your curves as he goes.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cUs,\u201d you tell him, and feel as if a weight has been lifted off your chest in doing so.\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019ve been doing this off and on for so long, and get nowhere with it. Yet, we always come back for more.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cCould never get sick of yeh, petal,\u201d he explains, and your non-beating heart swells. You lean down to catch his lips with yours, and smile against them.\u00a0\u201cAlways am craving you.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cAnd to think I thought you only wanted me at first just in spite of Nathan,\u201d you continue, but have to stop as your cell phone dings from the bedside table. Your gaze snaps to it, but Harry places his fingers under your chin so your eyes meet his again.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cIgnore it,\u201d he suggests, and you consider doing so; but decide against it as the phone dings again.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cNo, I think it\u2019s Jake,\u201d you tell him, and roll out of his hold to go over and answer the phone; wrapping the towel back around you as you do so.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cJake?\u201d He asks accusingly.\u00a0\u201cWho the hell is <i>Jake</i>?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cA friend\u00a0I&rsquo;ve made over the years,\u201d you explain, and unlock your phone to see that it is indeed Jake texting you.\u00a0\u201cAn ex, actually. We still keep in contact, he\u2019s living here currently.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cAnd he\u2019s a vampire?\u201d Harry continues to grill, visibly getting grumpier.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cYes he\u2019s a vampire,\u201d you confirm, and take in your best friends body language.\u00a0\u201cWait. Are you jealous?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cHa,\u201d he says sarcastically.\u00a0\u201cI am not jealous, Y/N. Just don\u2019t necessarily like the idea of meeting up with this guy.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cAlso know as, being jealous,\u201d you correct teasingly.\u00a0\u201cAwwww is Harry mad that he\u2019s not getting my full attention? Wow, I am living for this.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t get jealous over someone who\u2019s just good for a couple of fucks every once in a while,\u201d he mumbles, and catches you completely off guard.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d You ask disbelieving, feeling as if someone has just reached into your chest and crushed your heart; the tears quickly filling your eyes as you choke back a sob.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cWait no, Y/N, I didn&rsquo;t mean it like that,\u201d he starts, and stands up from the bed to step towards you.\u00a0\u201cYou are so much more than th-.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cGet out,\u201d you yell as the tears start streaming down your face.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cY/N listen,\u201d he tries to reason.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cGET OUT, HARRY!\u201d You yell, and grab ahold of the small lamp that resides on the table; yanking the cable out of the wall before chucking it across the room, and watching it shatter into the wall after it soars past the curly haired boy.\u00a0\u201cJust&hellip; leave. I-I have nothing else to say to you.\u201d<br/></p><p>He looks from the mess on the floor to you, with absolute regret written across his face. You can basically sense the internal conflict he\u2019s having, and think he\u2019s going to come towards you; but he starts nodding his head in understanding instead.\u00a0\u201cIf that\u2019s what you want,\u201d he starts, and looks at you pleadingly; as if begging you to stop him from leaving.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cGo,\u201d you tell him firmly, and he lets out a shaky breath.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cOk,\u201d he replies, and moves towards the door. He opens it and goes to step out, but pauses.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cLeave Harry!\u201d You yell once again, desperately, and this time he let\u2019s the door close behind him without another word; leaving you to breakdown all on your own.\u00a0<br/></p><p>Another hour passes, and you\u2019re still distraught. Harry has been the one constant thing in your life for so long, and to hear something like that from the person you will always love; is soul crushing.\u00a0</p><p>You considered making a quick trip out of the hotel so you could feed before coming back, and sulking the night away alone; but Jake convinced you otherwise. Which now leads you to heading down to the hotel lobby, to meet up with your friend.\u00a0</p><p>The elevator door dings open, as you smooth out your flowy top and tight jeans, to be met with the ginning face of one of your favourite vampires.\u00a0\u201cY/N!\u201d He greets enthusiastically, and opens his arms up.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cJake!\u201d You squeal, and rush towards him; engulfing him into a tight hug.\u00a0\u201cHow are you?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good,\u201d he laughs, and gives you a squeeze before moving away slightly.\u00a0\u201cNow how about we go get you those drinks now, yeah?\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d you groan, and motion for him to lead the way out of the hotel.\u00a0<br/></p><p>The two of you make way down the streets of The Six, catching up, and just genuinely enjoying each other\u2019s company; which is really nice.\u00a0\u201cI also have a girlfriend now,\u201d Jake begins to conclude his story.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d You ask excitedly as you both turn down an alleyway, to what you assume is a shortcut to where you\u2019re are headed.\u00a0\u201cAwe, that\u2019s awesome Jake.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cYeah, she\u2019s amazing,\u201d he tells you with a small grin.\u00a0\u201cWhat about you? How\u2019s er-Harry? Is that his name?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cUhm, it\u2019s complicated,\u201d you start to explain, and continue walking forward; not noticing he\u2019s stopped. You take in your surroundings, noting how this alley get\u2019s sketchier the further you walk down it; suddenly getting a really bad vibe about it all.\u00a0\u201cHey Jake, are you sure this is the right way?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s not,\u201d a deep voice speaks up from behind you, and causes your heart to plummet into your stomach. You whip around, and sure enough the man himself stands there surrounded by goons; Jake standing uneasily in the midst of them.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cNathan,\u201d you whisper as you take in his familiar messy blonde hair, and try to stay calm despite the panic you feel building within you.\u00a0\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cI think you know what I want, Y/N, don&rsquo;t play dumb,\u201d he replies, and steps forward; causing you to step back and bump into one of his men that now completely have you surrounded.\u00a0\u201cI want you and Harry to suffer, obviously. But you\u2019re all on your own, hmm. Trouble in paradise, darling?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cNo need to drag Harry into this when\u00a0I&rsquo;m the one you have a grudge against,\u201d you spit through gritted teeth; glancing at all the other vampires that circle around you.\u00a0\u201cStill unable to fight your own battles, I see.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cMmm they\u2019re just here to help make sure everything goes as planned,\u201d he states, and narrows his gaze at you.\u00a0\u201cAlso you\u2019re wrong there love, Harry took something that belonged to me&hellip; and for that he needs to pay.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cGood luck with that,\u201d you state before whipping around and kneeing the closest vampire to you in the groin. He hunches over in pain, as you move to kick the next one in attempt to escape.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cGrab her!\u201d Nathan seethes, and you start going at it. You grab the small wooden switchblade you stored in your boot just in case, and start swinging; getting a few good jabs at some of the vampires that try to grab onto you. Just as you\u2019re about to snap the neck on one of them, two wrap their arms around you and pull you towards the ground onto your knees; prying the switchblade from your grasp, and holding it against your throat.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cGet off of me,\u201d you yell, and struggle against their hold; but it\u2019s no use. Nathan chuckles maliciously as he steps towards you, and you feel absolutely defenceless.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve waited a long time for this,\u201d he smirks as he saunters over, sticking out his hand to be given a large wooden stake from one of the goons.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWoah, wait,\u201d Jake starts yelling, as other vampires move to hold him back.\u00a0\u201cYou said if I brought her to you, you wouldn&rsquo;t hurt her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI lied,\u201d Nathan shrugs, and moves back to face you. You let out a nervous breath before replacing it with the last ounce of courage you have, and leaning back slightly before spitting in his face.\u00a0\u201cYou <i>bitch</i>!\u201d He raises his hand, and it soon makes harsh contact with your cheek. You gasp at the impact, but try not to let it faze you as you look back to him, and see him staring up at something. You try to look up as well but your head is aggressively forced back down to face the ground. Nathan starts chuckling again, and looks down at you as he licks his lips.\u00a0\u201cThis\u2019ll be fun.\u201d<br/></p><p>With one final stride, and no warning; he stabs the stake swiftly into your gut, angling it up towards your heart. You gasp at the impact, and yell out at the pain as the piece of wood moves closer to your heart; only one move from killing you completely. Your gaze moves to Nathan once again, as he just stares down at you. You can feel your skin physically hardening, and greying; preparing for death&hellip; but it doesn&rsquo;t happen. Instead, Nathan removes the stake and quickly places his hands on either side of your head to twist it until there\u2019s another revolting crack; and everything goes black, yet again.\u00a0</p><p>&hellip; Little did you know that no more than a block or so away a brooding curly haired vampire sat on the edge of a roof; swaying his feet back and forth as he watched the people down below.\u00a0</p><p>Harry felt horrible for what he said to you back at the hotel, and was desperately trying to figure out how to make it up to you. He\u2019s known since the day he met you that you\u2019re the one he\u2019s supposed to end up with, but this time around his jealousy got the better of him when there was a mention of an ex-boyfriend of yours.\u00a0</p><p>Just as he was standing up to head back the hotel in hopes you\u2019d let him back in, his enhanced hearing picked up on a familiar voice in panic, and he froze.\u00a0\u201cGet off of me,\u201d it echoed in his ears, and he instantly started bolting in the direction the noise came from.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cY/N!\u201d He yelled, but knew you\u2019d more than likely not hear him. He finally reached the roof of the building he thought the noise came from, and glanced down into the alleyway that separated this building, and the one beside it.\u00a0<br/></p><p>The first thing he witnessed was you being forced onto your knee\u2019s, as Nathan smacked his hand across your cheek while being surrounded by at least twenty other vampires; and that made his blood boil. He was about to intervene but froze in his tracks as Nathan glanced upwards, and locked eye contact with him. A sickening grin spread across his mouth as he started chuckling, and looked back down to you.\u00a0</p><p>Harry was about to hop down from the roof right then and there, but was stopped by a force yanking him backwards. He was quick getting to his feet just as the vampire opposite to him started charging towards him with a stake. Smoothly, he avoided the attack and was able to get ahold of the woman&rsquo;s neck; twisting it until she fell limp to the ground.\u00a0</p><p>In an instant, Harry was back at the edge of the roof just in time to see your grey lifeless body fall to the ground at Nathan\u2019s feet. An involuntary sob left his mouth at the sight, and caused the man who he thought just murdered the love of his life to look up at him with a taunting grin.\u00a0\u201cSorry for your loss, Styles,\u201d the murderer stated smugly before disappearing with your body, and the other vampires; all in the blink of an eye.\u00a0</p><p>taglist: <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfM-yUqulVOUviAjks88vew\">@alwaysjacked-up</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mhf8dINbmrPLdvlPy50LZjA\">@isitjamiemoriarty</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/md7v_RujD3qQwyWIeP1i63g\">@hrrysgirl</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJ9-xceeLtvXr003j4t6JCA\">@theasstour</a> GUY\u2019S I FINALLY WROTE PART 2 WOW</p>",

Calm the hell down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsk if I give a shit,\u201d you seethe, as you struggle to get yourself unstuck from the awkward position you\u2019re in. \u201cAs soon as I get out of this\u2026 you\u2019re- you\u2019re-.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m what?\u201d He asks with a chuckle, enjoying watching you struggle. He leaves you be as he pulls up to the window, and the poor cashier looks completely taken aback by the scene in front of her. \u201cShe\u2019s having a bit of a rough go,\u201d he tells the girl casually as you finally pull yourself onto the seat in an upright position. She just nods awkwardly and hands him the food, clearly not wanting to deal with any of this. </p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d you say to the girl, and lean over across Harry to get a better look at her. \u201cCall the cops, this man is kidnapping me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave a good day!\u201d Harry yells cheerily to cut you off, before rolling up the tinted window, and ripping out of the parking lot. You glare at him, as you let out numerous groans and huffs, all while trying to get comfy in the seat\u2026 only severely disappointed with the fact he has the child lock on, and you can\u2019t escape. \u201cAre you done?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d you state, and turn the volume of the stereo right down; trying to contain your annoyance with every little thing at the moment. </p><p>\u201cWhat- this is one of your favourite songs,\u201d he replies disbelieving as he turns the stereo back up. </p><p>\u201cDo I look like I\u2019m in the mood for The Killers right now?\u201d You snap, and he just laughs. \u201cNow where the hell are we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOk first off,\u201d he starts and raises an eyebrow at you. \u201cM'sorry for snapping your neck, but we wouldn\u2019t even be out of New York if I didn\u2019t. Second, we\u2019re almost in Toronto.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Toronto</i>?\u201d You gasp, and glance out the window at the Canadian scenery. \u201cI\u2019ve been asleep for that long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah I was just thinking that actually,\u201d he states. \u201cY'know, before you <i>attacked</i> me. But eight hours is a long time, is everything alright with you? You should\u2019ve healed faster than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t had much blood other than what you gave me last night,\u201d you tell him and crack your neck again. </p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d he nods in understanding. \u201cWe\u2019ll get you some as soon as we stop.\u201d You nod in agreement, and slowly move your gaze back out the window; letting the worry some thoughts slowly creep into your mind.</p><p>\u201cHarry?\u201d You ask quietly, knowing he\u2019ll be able to hear you. Without looking at him, you take a nervous breath; feeling his gaze burn into you as he waits for you to continue. \u201cWhat if he finds us?\u201d</p><p>He\u00a0doesn\u2019t respond right away, but rather reaches across to gently grab ahold of your hand. His gesture catches you off guard, but you can\u2019t help the small smile the forms on your lips as he rubs his thumb over your knuckles.\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he tells you honestly.\u00a0\u201cBut I know we\u2019ll be ok in the end, regardless of what happens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what makes you so sure?\u201d You ask curiously.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m pretty positive he\u2019s not wanting to just have a nice chat with us after what happened two-hundred years ago, you know?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWell I can agree with that statement based on when I had that run-in with him, as well as the goons he sent after us,\u201d he replies, and you bite down on your bottom lip.\u00a0\u201cBut we\u2019ve also made it through the last two centuries together. Despite all the odds, we\u2019re still here\u2026 Somehow.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d you agree with a small laugh.\u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s when we became best friends.\u00a0Who knew we\u2019d still be stuck with each other after all this time though? I mean, even as humans; no one wanted us to be together. Hell, everyone and their dog seemingly tried to keep us apart, but damn we were stubborn.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWe really were,\u201d he chuckles, and nods his head.\u00a0\u201cStill don\u2019t know what caused you to make a move on me in the first place. I mean, yes we were close but\u2026\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d You ask incredulously, and smack his arm.\u00a0\u201cIf\u00a0I\u2019m not mistaken, you were the one who would send me suggestive glances first, and weren\u2019t <i>you</i> the one to pull <i>me</i>\u00a0into the shadows as I was going up the estate\u2019s staircase to bed; before pushing me up against the wall and kissing me.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cOk you got me there,\u201d he says with an eye-roll, a smirk stretching across his mouth.\u00a0\u201cNot my fault though, you just showed up out of the blue. I remember I had worked for that dick for almost a year before you arrived that chilly February day, m\u2019birthday actually. The sight of you climbing out of that horse carriage with your hair all done up, and wearing that ridiculous Victorian dress. I\u2019ll never forget it.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI <i>hated</i> those dresses,\u201d you state dramatically.\u00a0\u201cI remember my father telling me how dressed up I needed to be to meet Nathan, seeing as he was prospected to be my suitor. And even on my first day there I could tell how awful of a person he was, just with the way he treated the people working for or even just around him. How he acted so rude and abusive towards you, and the other\u2019s\u2026 It was disgusting.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWhich is why it was such a breathe of fresh air when you arrived,\u201d he continues.\u00a0\u201cAll of us adored you, Y/N. Even though we were the\u00a0\u2018help,\u2019 in the in the months you stayed there, you treated us like human beings rather than objects just there for your disposal like Nathan did. Didn\u2019t take me long to fall in love with you, despite the others warning me of what would happen if Nathan ever found out. Still can\u2019t believe you even gave me a chance.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYou underestimate yourself,\u201d you tell him, and look back out the window to see the Toronto skyline appearing in the distance.\u00a0\u201cI could never fall for someone so heartless and cruel like Nathan. You made me feel\u2026 wired, and full of excitement. Like I could finally live a bit of my life the way I wanted too, rather than how my father had planned out for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why it didn\u2019t take much convincing for you to sneak around with me, isn\u2019t it?\u201d He asks, and you nod your head.</p><p>\u201cYep,\u201d you confirm with a laugh.\u00a0\u201cAlthough it took you long enough to make the first move\u2026 But, I can only imagine where we\u2019d be if we didn\u2019t do any of that though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do that,\u201d he says firmly, and squeezes your hand so you\u2019ll look at him.\u00a0\u201cWe loved each other, Y/N. Although they didn\u2019t necessarily agree with what we were doing; everyone called us soulmates, and it\u2019s not on us that what happened, happened. It\u2019s on Nathan. He couldn\u2019t stand the thought of me having something he wanted so badly, and it was disgusting how he treated you like a trophy. My heart broke each time I saw the two of you together, and I wanted nothing more than to just walk up and pull you away from him; but I couldn\u2019t. I knew what would happen if I did, and knew that just wasn\u2019t an option\u2026 And then he found out about us anyways.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYeah\u2026\u201d You trail off, and look down.\u00a0\u201cWe really did love each other, didn\u2019t we? And then Nathan basically locked me in my room after finding out. Moved the wedding up to Halloween, and then that wonderful night came along. Now look at us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a couple of <i>wandering souls</i>,\u201d\u00a0he states with a smirk, knowing he\u2019d get a reaction out of you with that being what he called the two of you as humans.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWith no where to go,\u201d you finish the statement, and roll your eyes at his cheesiness.\u00a0\u201cNow can we please stop talking about the past, it\u2019s bumming me out.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cThe past is catching up with us, Y/N,\u201d he tells you with a sigh.\u00a0\u201cThere\u2019s not much we can do to avoid it.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWe can try,\u201d you whisper, and go back to silently looking out the window for the remainder of the ride into Toronto.\u00a0<br></p><p>A couple of hours go by, and the two of you are now settled into a hotel room right downtown. You haven\u2019t said much else about the whole Nathan topic, but naturally that has to change.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI think we should come up with some sort of plan,\u201d Harry speaks up from the chair in the corner of the room, as you emerge from the washroom in a towel after showering. He looks you up and down, and you smirk cockily; thinking about what happened between the two of you last night.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat for?\u201d You ask cluelessly in attempt to get a rise out of him.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cY/N, Nathan could be right behind us for all we know,\u201d he snaps.<br></p><p>\u201cI know, Harry,\u201d you yell right back.\u00a0\u201cBut it\u2019s also doubtful, Nathan wouldn\u2019t make himself known unless he needed too. Which I think is why he didn\u2019t show up last night, he wasn\u2019t nearby.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cOr I just got us out of there before he could show up,\u201d your best friend murmurs to himself, causing you to groan.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d you snark, and move to the bag of clothes Harry stuffed full for you upon rushing out of your apartment.\u00a0\u201cWe should go grab a couple of drinks, have some fun, y\u2019know? It\u2019d beat staying around here stressing out all night.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>A cool breeze whips around, and you don\u2019t even have to turn around to know that Harry is now behind you.\u00a0\u201cWe could have some fun here,\u201d he suggests, and leans down to brush his lips against your neck; placing his hands on your hips.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to the blood we talked about getting upon arriving here?\u201d You ask smugly, and turn around to face him; allowing him to gently push you up against the wall.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWe could still get it,\u201d he replies, and speeds the two of you over to the bed so your back is on the mattress, as he hovers over you.\u00a0\u201cIn a little bit though.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cToo bad I\u2019m <i>starving</i>,\u201d you tease as he begins placing love bites all along your collarbone once again.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cMe too,\u201d he states, before moving his mouth to meet yours.\u00a0\u201cBut not just for blood.\u201d<br></p><p>You kiss him back, but use your vampire abilities to quickly flip the two of you so you\u2019re above him; letting the towel fall slightly so it\u2019s the only thing separating your two\u2019s bodies pressed together.\u00a0\u201cDon\u2019t you get sick of this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSick of what?\u201d He asks, and runs his fingers along your exposed skin; tracing your curves as he goes.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cUs,\u201d you tell him, and feel as if a weight has been lifted off your chest in doing so.\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019ve been doing this off and on for so long, and get nowhere with it. Yet, we always come back for more.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cCould never get sick of yeh, petal,\u201d he explains, and your non-beating heart swells. You lean down to catch his lips with yours, and smile against them.\u00a0\u201cAlways am craving you.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cAnd to think I thought you only wanted me at first just in spite of Nathan,\u201d you continue, but have to stop as your cell phone dings from the bedside table. Your gaze snaps to it, but Harry places his fingers under your chin so your eyes meet his again.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cIgnore it,\u201d he suggests, and you consider doing so; but decide against it as the phone dings again.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cNo, I think it\u2019s Jake,\u201d you tell him, and roll out of his hold to go over and answer the phone; wrapping the towel back around you as you do so.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cJake?\u201d He asks accusingly.\u00a0\u201cWho the hell is <i>Jake</i>?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cA friend\u00a0I\u2019ve made over the years,\u201d you explain, and unlock your phone to see that it is indeed Jake texting you.\u00a0\u201cAn ex, actually. We still keep in contact, he\u2019s living here currently.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cAnd he\u2019s a vampire?\u201d Harry continues to grill, visibly getting grumpier.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYes he\u2019s a vampire,\u201d you confirm, and take in your best friends body language.\u00a0\u201cWait. Are you jealous?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cHa,\u201d he says sarcastically.\u00a0\u201cI am not jealous, Y/N. Just don\u2019t necessarily like the idea of meeting up with this guy.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cAlso know as, being jealous,\u201d you correct teasingly.\u00a0\u201cAwwww is Harry mad that he\u2019s not getting my full attention? Wow, I am living for this.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t get jealous over someone who\u2019s just good for a couple of fucks every once in a while,\u201d he mumbles, and catches you completely off guard.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d You ask disbelieving, feeling as if someone has just reached into your chest and crushed your heart; the tears quickly filling your eyes as you choke back a sob.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWait no, Y/N, I didn\u2019t mean it like that,\u201d he starts, and stands up from the bed to step towards you.\u00a0\u201cYou are so much more than th-.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cGet out,\u201d you yell as the tears start streaming down your face.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cY/N listen,\u201d he tries to reason.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cGET OUT, HARRY!\u201d You yell, and grab ahold of the small lamp that resides on the table; yanking the cable out of the wall before chucking it across the room, and watching it shatter into the wall after it soars past the curly haired boy.\u00a0\u201cJust\u2026 leave. I-I have nothing else to say to you.\u201d<br></p><p>He looks from the mess on the floor to you, with absolute regret written across his face. You can basically sense the internal conflict he\u2019s having, and think he\u2019s going to come towards you; but he starts nodding his head in understanding instead.\u00a0\u201cIf that\u2019s what you want,\u201d he starts, and looks at you pleadingly; as if begging you to stop him from leaving.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cGo,\u201d you tell him firmly, and he lets out a shaky breath.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cOk,\u201d he replies, and moves towards the door. He opens it and goes to step out, but pauses.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cLeave Harry!\u201d You yell once again, desperately, and this time he let\u2019s the door close behind him without another word; leaving you to breakdown all on your own.\u00a0<br></p><p>Another hour passes, and you\u2019re still distraught. Harry has been the one constant thing in your life for so long, and to hear something like that from the person you will always love; is soul crushing.\u00a0</p><p>You considered making a quick trip out of the hotel so you could feed before coming back, and sulking the night away alone; but Jake convinced you otherwise. Which now leads you to heading down to the hotel lobby, to meet up with your friend.\u00a0</p><p>The elevator door dings open, as you smooth out your flowy top and tight jeans, to be met with the ginning face of one of your favourite vampires.\u00a0\u201cY/N!\u201d He greets enthusiastically, and opens his arms up.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cJake!\u201d You squeal, and rush towards him; engulfing him into a tight hug.\u00a0\u201cHow are you?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good,\u201d he laughs, and gives you a squeeze before moving away slightly.\u00a0\u201cNow how about we go get you those drinks now, yeah?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d you groan, and motion for him to lead the way out of the hotel.\u00a0<br></p><p>The two of you make way down the streets of The Six, catching up, and just genuinely enjoying each other\u2019s company; which is really nice.\u00a0\u201cI also have a girlfriend now,\u201d Jake begins to conclude his story.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d You ask excitedly as you both turn down an alleyway, to what you assume is a shortcut to where you\u2019re are headed.\u00a0\u201cAwe, that\u2019s awesome Jake.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYeah, she\u2019s amazing,\u201d he tells you with a small grin.\u00a0\u201cWhat about you? How\u2019s er-Harry? Is that his name?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cUhm, it\u2019s complicated,\u201d you start to explain, and continue walking forward; not noticing he\u2019s stopped. You take in your surroundings, noting how this alley get\u2019s sketchier the further you walk down it; suddenly getting a really bad vibe about it all.\u00a0\u201cHey Jake, are you sure this is the right way?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s not,\u201d a deep voice speaks up from behind you, and causes your heart to plummet into your stomach. You whip around, and sure enough the man himself stands there surrounded by goons; Jake standing uneasily in the midst of them.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cNathan,\u201d you whisper as you take in his familiar messy blonde hair, and try to stay calm despite the panic you feel building within you.\u00a0\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI think you know what I want, Y/N, don\u2019t play dumb,\u201d he replies, and steps forward; causing you to step back and bump into one of his men that now completely have you surrounded.\u00a0\u201cI want you and Harry to suffer, obviously. But you\u2019re all on your own, hmm. Trouble in paradise, darling?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cNo need to drag Harry into this when\u00a0I\u2019m the one you have a grudge against,\u201d you spit through gritted teeth; glancing at all the other vampires that circle around you.\u00a0\u201cStill unable to fight your own battles, I see.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cMmm they\u2019re just here to help make sure everything goes as planned,\u201d he states, and narrows his gaze at you.\u00a0\u201cAlso you\u2019re wrong there love, Harry took something that belonged to me\u2026 and for that he needs to pay.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cGood luck with that,\u201d you state before whipping around and kneeing the closest vampire to you in the groin. He hunches over in pain, as you move to kick the next one in attempt to escape.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cGrab her!\u201d Nathan seethes, and you start going at it. You grab the small wooden switchblade you stored in your boot just in case, and start swinging; getting a few good jabs at some of the vampires that try to grab onto you. Just as you\u2019re about to snap the neck on one of them, two wrap their arms around you and pull you towards the ground onto your knees; prying the switchblade from your grasp, and holding it against your throat.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cGet off of me,\u201d you yell, and struggle against their hold; but it\u2019s no use. Nathan chuckles maliciously as he steps towards you, and you feel absolutely defenceless.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve waited a long time for this,\u201d he smirks as he saunters over, sticking out his hand to be given a large wooden stake from one of the goons.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWoah, wait,\u201d Jake starts yelling, as other vampires move to hold him back.\u00a0\u201cYou said if I brought her to you, you wouldn\u2019t hurt her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI lied,\u201d Nathan shrugs, and moves back to face you. You let out a nervous breath before replacing it with the last ounce of courage you have, and leaning back slightly before spitting in his face.\u00a0\u201cYou <i>bitch</i>!\u201d He raises his hand, and it soon makes harsh contact with your cheek. You gasp at the impact, but try not to let it faze you as you look back to him, and see him staring up at something. You try to look up as well but your head is aggressively forced back down to face the ground. Nathan starts chuckling again, and looks down at you as he licks his lips.\u00a0\u201cThis\u2019ll be fun.\u201d<br></p><p>With one final stride, and no warning; he stabs the stake swiftly into your gut, angling it up towards your heart. You gasp at the impact, and yell out at the pain as the piece of wood moves closer to your heart; only one move from killing you completely. Your gaze moves to Nathan once again, as he just stares down at you. You can feel your skin physically hardening, and greying; preparing for death\u2026 but it doesn\u2019t happen. Instead, Nathan removes the stake and quickly places his hands on either side of your head to twist it until there\u2019s another revolting crack; and everything goes black, yet again.\u00a0</p><p>\u2026 Little did you know that no more than a block or so away a brooding curly haired vampire sat on the edge of a roof; swaying his feet back and forth as he watched the people down below.\u00a0</p><p>Harry felt horrible for what he said to you back at the hotel, and was desperately trying to figure out how to make it up to you. He\u2019s known since the day he met you that you\u2019re the one he\u2019s supposed to end up with, but this time around his jealousy got the better of him when there was a mention of an ex-boyfriend of yours.\u00a0</p><p>Just as he was standing up to head back the hotel in hopes you\u2019d let him back in, his enhanced hearing picked up on a familiar voice in panic, and he froze.\u00a0\u201cGet off of me,\u201d it echoed in his ears, and he instantly started bolting in the direction the noise came from.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cY/N!\u201d He yelled, but knew you\u2019d more than likely not hear him. He finally reached the roof of the building he thought the noise came from, and glanced down into the alleyway that separated this building, and the one beside it.\u00a0<br></p><p>The first thing he witnessed was you being forced onto your knee\u2019s, as Nathan smacked his hand across your cheek while being surrounded by at least twenty other vampires; and that made his blood boil. He was about to intervene but froze in his tracks as Nathan glanced upwards, and locked eye contact with him. A sickening grin spread across his mouth as he started chuckling, and looked back down to you.\u00a0</p><p>Harry was about to hop down from the roof right then and there, but was stopped by a force yanking him backwards. He was quick getting to his feet just as the vampire opposite to him started charging towards him with a stake. Smoothly, he avoided the attack and was able to get ahold of the woman\u2019s neck; twisting it until she fell limp to the ground.\u00a0</p><p>In an instant, Harry was back at the edge of the roof just in time to see your grey lifeless body fall to the ground at Nathan\u2019s feet. An involuntary sob left his mouth at the sight, and caused the man who he thought just murdered the love of his life to look up at him with a taunting grin.\u00a0\u201cSorry for your loss, Styles,\u201d the murderer stated smugly before disappearing with your body, and the other vampires; all in the blink of an eye.\u00a0</p><p>taglist: <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfM-yUqulVOUviAjks88vew\">@alwaysjacked-up</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mhf8dINbmrPLdvlPy50LZjA\">@isitjamiemoriarty</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/md7v_RujD3qQwyWIeP1i63g\">@hrrysgirl</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJ9-xceeLtvXr003j4t6JCA\">@theasstour</a> GUY\u2019S I FINALLY WROTE PART 2 WOW</p></p>",

Looking around, you note that you\u2019re laying on the leather backseat of a random car in what appears to be a McDonald\u2019s drive-thru. The sun shining brightly outside is a good indicator that you\u2019ve been passed out for quite sometime, and that leads you to finally move your gaze to the person who has caused this entire predicament. </p><p>In the driver\u2019s seat of the car Harry mindlessly taps his fingers against the steering wheel, and loudly sings along to the lyrics of \u2018Mr. Brightside\u2019 as the chorus starts. He\u2019s in his own little world as he moves forward in the line, awaiting his turn to pay for his order and drive off; and unsurprisingly he hasn't\u00a0noticed that you\u2019ve awoken.</p><p>You crack your stiff neck, as you slowly sit up and try your best not to start yelling at him. Your eyes remain locked on your curly haired best friend as he belts out the words of the song without flaw, and you pounce; wrapping your arm around his neck, and pulling him aggressively back against the carseat. \u201cYou ASSHOLE!\u201d You growl, and glare into the rearview mirror so your eyes can lock with his. \u201cAs if you snapped my neck on me <i>again. </i>That\u2019s low, even for you Harry.\u201d He struggles against you, but you just continue choking him with ease.\u00a0</p><p>You begin thinking you\u2019ve gotten the upper hand against him, but are greatly mistaken as he reaches back to grab ahold of you, and flips you over into the passenger seat; causing your butt to miss it completely as you fall down between the dash and car seat, onto the floor. </p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cAre you <i>insane</i>?\u201d He hisses. \u201cThere\u2019s people watching, Y/N. Calm the hell down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsk if I give a shit,\u201d you seethe, as you struggle to get yourself unstuck from the awkward position you\u2019re in. \u201cAs soon as I get out of this\u2026 you\u2019re- you\u2019re-.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m what?\u201d He asks with a chuckle, enjoying watching you struggle. He leaves you be as he pulls up to the window, and the poor cashier looks completely taken aback by the scene in front of her. \u201cShe\u2019s having a bit of a rough go,\u201d he tells the girl casually as you finally pull yourself onto the seat in an upright position. She just nods awkwardly and hands him the food, clearly not wanting to deal with any of this. </p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d you say to the girl, and lean over across Harry to get a better look at her. \u201cCall the cops, this man is kidnapping me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave a good day!\u201d Harry yells cheerily to cut you off, before rolling up the tinted window, and ripping out of the parking lot. You glare at him, as you let out numerous groans and huffs, all while trying to get comfy in the seat\u2026 only severely disappointed with the fact he has the child lock on, and you can\u2019t escape. \u201cAre you done?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d you state, and turn the volume of the stereo right down; trying to contain your annoyance with every little thing at the moment. </p><p>\u201cWhat- this is one of your favourite songs,\u201d he replies disbelieving as he turns the stereo back up. </p><p>\u201cDo I look like I\u2019m in the mood for The Killers right now?\u201d You snap, and he just laughs. \u201cNow where the hell are we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOk first off,\u201d he starts and raises an eyebrow at you. \u201cM'sorry for snapping your neck, but we wouldn\u2019t even be out of New York if I didn\u2019t. Second, we\u2019re almost in Toronto.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Toronto</i>?\u201d You gasp, and glance out the window at the Canadian scenery. \u201cI\u2019ve been asleep for that long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah I was just thinking that actually,\u201d he states. \u201cY'know, before you <i>attacked</i> me. But eight hours is a long time, is everything alright with you? You should\u2019ve healed faster than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t had much blood other than what you gave me last night,\u201d you tell him and crack your neck again. </p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d he nods in understanding. \u201cWe\u2019ll get you some as soon as we stop.\u201d You nod in agreement, and slowly move your gaze back out the window; letting the worry some thoughts slowly creep into your mind.</p><p>\u201cHarry?\u201d You ask quietly, knowing he\u2019ll be able to hear you. Without looking at him, you take a nervous breath; feeling his gaze burn into you as he waits for you to continue. \u201cWhat if he finds us?\u201d</p><p>He\u00a0doesn\u2019t respond right away, but rather reaches across to gently grab ahold of your hand. His gesture catches you off guard, but you can\u2019t help the small smile the forms on your lips as he rubs his thumb over your knuckles.\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he tells you honestly.\u00a0\u201cBut I know we\u2019ll be ok in the end, regardless of what happens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what makes you so sure?\u201d You ask curiously.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m pretty positive he\u2019s not wanting to just have a nice chat with us after what happened two-hundred years ago, you know?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWell I can agree with that statement based on when I had that run-in with him, as well as the goons he sent after us,\u201d he replies, and you bite down on your bottom lip.\u00a0\u201cBut we\u2019ve also made it through the last two centuries together. Despite all the odds, we\u2019re still here\u2026 Somehow.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d you agree with a small laugh.\u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s when we became best friends.\u00a0Who knew we\u2019d still be stuck with each other after all this time though? I mean, even as humans; no one wanted us to be together. Hell, everyone and their dog seemingly tried to keep us apart, but damn we were stubborn.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWe really were,\u201d he chuckles, and nods his head.\u00a0\u201cStill don\u2019t know what caused you to make a move on me in the first place. I mean, yes we were close but\u2026\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d You ask incredulously, and smack his arm.\u00a0\u201cIf\u00a0I\u2019m not mistaken, you were the one who would send me suggestive glances first, and weren\u2019t <i>you</i> the one to pull <i>me</i>\u00a0into the shadows as I was going up the estate\u2019s staircase to bed; before pushing me up against the wall and kissing me.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cOk you got me there,\u201d he says with an eye-roll, a smirk stretching across his mouth.\u00a0\u201cNot my fault though, you just showed up out of the blue. I remember I had worked for that dick for almost a year before you arrived that chilly February day, m\u2019birthday actually. The sight of you climbing out of that horse carriage with your hair all done up, and wearing that ridiculous Victorian dress. I\u2019ll never forget it.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI <i>hated</i> those dresses,\u201d you state dramatically.\u00a0\u201cI remember my father telling me how dressed up I needed to be to meet Nathan, seeing as he was prospected to be my suitor. And even on my first day there I could tell how awful of a person he was, just with the way he treated the people working for or even just around him. How he acted so rude and abusive towards you, and the other\u2019s\u2026 It was disgusting.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWhich is why it was such a breathe of fresh air when you arrived,\u201d he continues.\u00a0\u201cAll of us adored you, Y/N. Even though we were the\u00a0\u2018help,\u2019 in the in the months you stayed there, you treated us like human beings rather than objects just there for your disposal like Nathan did. Didn\u2019t take me long to fall in love with you, despite the others warning me of what would happen if Nathan ever found out. Still can\u2019t believe you even gave me a chance.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYou underestimate yourself,\u201d you tell him, and look back out the window to see the Toronto skyline appearing in the distance.\u00a0\u201cI could never fall for someone so heartless and cruel like Nathan. You made me feel\u2026 wired, and full of excitement. Like I could finally live a bit of my life the way I wanted too, rather than how my father had planned out for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why it didn\u2019t take much convincing for you to sneak around with me, isn\u2019t it?\u201d He asks, and you nod your head.</p><p>\u201cYep,\u201d you confirm with a laugh.\u00a0\u201cAlthough it took you long enough to make the first move\u2026 But, I can only imagine where we\u2019d be if we didn\u2019t do any of that though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do that,\u201d he says firmly, and squeezes your hand so you\u2019ll look at him.\u00a0\u201cWe loved each other, Y/N. Although they didn\u2019t necessarily agree with what we were doing; everyone called us soulmates, and it\u2019s not on us that what happened, happened. It\u2019s on Nathan. He couldn\u2019t stand the thought of me having something he wanted so badly, and it was disgusting how he treated you like a trophy. My heart broke each time I saw the two of you together, and I wanted nothing more than to just walk up and pull you away from him; but I couldn\u2019t. I knew what would happen if I did, and knew that just wasn\u2019t an option\u2026 And then he found out about us anyways.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYeah\u2026\u201d You trail off, and look down.\u00a0\u201cWe really did love each other, didn\u2019t we? And then Nathan basically locked me in my room after finding out. Moved the wedding up to Halloween, and then that wonderful night came along. Now look at us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a couple of <i>wandering souls</i>,\u201d\u00a0he states with a smirk, knowing he\u2019d get a reaction out of you with that being what he called the two of you as humans.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWith no where to go,\u201d you finish the statement, and roll your eyes at his cheesiness.\u00a0\u201cNow can we please stop talking about the past, it\u2019s bumming me out.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cThe past is catching up with us, Y/N,\u201d he tells you with a sigh.\u00a0\u201cThere\u2019s not much we can do to avoid it.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWe can try,\u201d you whisper, and go back to silently looking out the window for the remainder of the ride into Toronto.\u00a0<br></p><p>A couple of hours go by, and the two of you are now settled into a hotel room right downtown. You haven\u2019t said much else about the whole Nathan topic, but naturally that has to change.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI think we should come up with some sort of plan,\u201d Harry speaks up from the chair in the corner of the room, as you emerge from the washroom in a towel after showering. He looks you up and down, and you smirk cockily; thinking about what happened between the two of you last night.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat for?\u201d You ask cluelessly in attempt to get a rise out of him.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cY/N, Nathan could be right behind us for all we know,\u201d he snaps.<br></p><p>\u201cI know, Harry,\u201d you yell right back.\u00a0\u201cBut it\u2019s also doubtful, Nathan wouldn\u2019t make himself known unless he needed too. Which I think is why he didn\u2019t show up last night, he wasn\u2019t nearby.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cOr I just got us out of there before he could show up,\u201d your best friend murmurs to himself, causing you to groan.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d you snark, and move to the bag of clothes Harry stuffed full for you upon rushing out of your apartment.\u00a0\u201cWe should go grab a couple of drinks, have some fun, y\u2019know? It\u2019d beat staying around here stressing out all night.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>A cool breeze whips around, and you don\u2019t even have to turn around to know that Harry is now behind you.\u00a0\u201cWe could have some fun here,\u201d he suggests, and leans down to brush his lips against your neck; placing his hands on your hips.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to the blood we talked about getting upon arriving here?\u201d You ask smugly, and turn around to face him; allowing him to gently push you up against the wall.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWe could still get it,\u201d he replies, and speeds the two of you over to the bed so your back is on the mattress, as he hovers over you.\u00a0\u201cIn a little bit though.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cToo bad I\u2019m <i>starving</i>,\u201d you tease as he begins placing love bites all along your collarbone once again.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cMe too,\u201d he states, before moving his mouth to meet yours.\u00a0\u201cBut not just for blood.\u201d<br></p><p>You kiss him back, but use your vampire abilities to quickly flip the two of you so you\u2019re above him; letting the towel fall slightly so it\u2019s the only thing separating your two\u2019s bodies pressed together.\u00a0\u201cDon\u2019t you get sick of this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSick of what?\u201d He asks, and runs his fingers along your exposed skin; tracing your curves as he goes.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cUs,\u201d you tell him, and feel as if a weight has been lifted off your chest in doing so.\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019ve been doing this off and on for so long, and get nowhere with it. Yet, we always come back for more.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cCould never get sick of yeh, petal,\u201d he explains, and your non-beating heart swells. You lean down to catch his lips with yours, and smile against them.\u00a0\u201cAlways am craving you.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cAnd to think I thought you only wanted me at first just in spite of Nathan,\u201d you continue, but have to stop as your cell phone dings from the bedside table. Your gaze snaps to it, but Harry places his fingers under your chin so your eyes meet his again.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cIgnore it,\u201d he suggests, and you consider doing so; but decide against it as the phone dings again.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cNo, I think it\u2019s Jake,\u201d you tell him, and roll out of his hold to go over and answer the phone; wrapping the towel back around you as you do so.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cJake?\u201d He asks accusingly.\u00a0\u201cWho the hell is <i>Jake</i>?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cA friend\u00a0I\u2019ve made over the years,\u201d you explain, and unlock your phone to see that it is indeed Jake texting you.\u00a0\u201cAn ex, actually. We still keep in contact, he\u2019s living here currently.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cAnd he\u2019s a vampire?\u201d Harry continues to grill, visibly getting grumpier.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYes he\u2019s a vampire,\u201d you confirm, and take in your best friends body language.\u00a0\u201cWait. Are you jealous?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cHa,\u201d he says sarcastically.\u00a0\u201cI am not jealous, Y/N. Just don\u2019t necessarily like the idea of meeting up with this guy.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cAlso know as, being jealous,\u201d you correct teasingly.\u00a0\u201cAwwww is Harry mad that he\u2019s not getting my full attention? Wow, I am living for this.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t get jealous over someone who\u2019s just good for a couple of fucks every once in a while,\u201d he mumbles, and catches you completely off guard.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d You ask disbelieving, feeling as if someone has just reached into your chest and crushed your heart; the tears quickly filling your eyes as you choke back a sob.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWait no, Y/N, I didn\u2019t mean it like that,\u201d he starts, and stands up from the bed to step towards you.\u00a0\u201cYou are so much more than th-.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cGet out,\u201d you yell as the tears start streaming down your face.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cY/N listen,\u201d he tries to reason.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cGET OUT, HARRY!\u201d You yell, and grab ahold of the small lamp that resides on the table; yanking the cable out of the wall before chucking it across the room, and watching it shatter into the wall after it soars past the curly haired boy.\u00a0\u201cJust\u2026 leave. I-I have nothing else to say to you.\u201d<br></p><p>He looks from the mess on the floor to you, with absolute regret written across his face. You can basically sense the internal conflict he\u2019s having, and think he\u2019s going to come towards you; but he starts nodding his head in understanding instead.\u00a0\u201cIf that\u2019s what you want,\u201d he starts, and looks at you pleadingly; as if begging you to stop him from leaving.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cGo,\u201d you tell him firmly, and he lets out a shaky breath.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cOk,\u201d he replies, and moves towards the door. He opens it and goes to step out, but pauses.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cLeave Harry!\u201d You yell once again, desperately, and this time he let\u2019s the door close behind him without another word; leaving you to breakdown all on your own.\u00a0<br></p><p>Another hour passes, and you\u2019re still distraught. Harry has been the one constant thing in your life for so long, and to hear something like that from the person you will always love; is soul crushing.\u00a0</p><p>You considered making a quick trip out of the hotel so you could feed before coming back, and sulking the night away alone; but Jake convinced you otherwise. Which now leads you to heading down to the hotel lobby, to meet up with your friend.\u00a0</p><p>The elevator door dings open, as you smooth out your flowy top and tight jeans, to be met with the ginning face of one of your favourite vampires.\u00a0\u201cY/N!\u201d He greets enthusiastically, and opens his arms up.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cJake!\u201d You squeal, and rush towards him; engulfing him into a tight hug.\u00a0\u201cHow are you?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good,\u201d he laughs, and gives you a squeeze before moving away slightly.\u00a0\u201cNow how about we go get you those drinks now, yeah?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d you groan, and motion for him to lead the way out of the hotel.\u00a0<br></p><p>The two of you make way down the streets of The Six, catching up, and just genuinely enjoying each other\u2019s company; which is really nice.\u00a0\u201cI also have a girlfriend now,\u201d Jake begins to conclude his story.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d You ask excitedly as you both turn down an alleyway, to what you assume is a shortcut to where you\u2019re are headed.\u00a0\u201cAwe, that\u2019s awesome Jake.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYeah, she\u2019s amazing,\u201d he tells you with a small grin.\u00a0\u201cWhat about you? How\u2019s er-Harry? Is that his name?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cUhm, it\u2019s complicated,\u201d you start to explain, and continue walking forward; not noticing he\u2019s stopped. You take in your surroundings, noting how this alley get\u2019s sketchier the further you walk down it; suddenly getting a really bad vibe about it all.\u00a0\u201cHey Jake, are you sure this is the right way?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s not,\u201d a deep voice speaks up from behind you, and causes your heart to plummet into your stomach. You whip around, and sure enough the man himself stands there surrounded by goons; Jake standing uneasily in the midst of them.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cNathan,\u201d you whisper as you take in his familiar messy blonde hair, and try to stay calm despite the panic you feel building within you.\u00a0\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI think you know what I want, Y/N, don\u2019t play dumb,\u201d he replies, and steps forward; causing you to step back and bump into one of his men that now completely have you surrounded.\u00a0\u201cI want you and Harry to suffer, obviously. But you\u2019re all on your own, hmm. Trouble in paradise, darling?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cNo need to drag Harry into this when\u00a0I\u2019m the one you have a grudge against,\u201d you spit through gritted teeth; glancing at all the other vampires that circle around you.\u00a0\u201cStill unable to fight your own battles, I see.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cMmm they\u2019re just here to help make sure everything goes as planned,\u201d he states, and narrows his gaze at you.\u00a0\u201cAlso you\u2019re wrong there love, Harry took something that belonged to me\u2026 and for that he needs to pay.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cGood luck with that,\u201d you state before whipping around and kneeing the closest vampire to you in the groin. He hunches over in pain, as you move to kick the next one in attempt to escape.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cGrab her!\u201d Nathan seethes, and you start going at it. You grab the small wooden switchblade you stored in your boot just in case, and start swinging; getting a few good jabs at some of the vampires that try to grab onto you. Just as you\u2019re about to snap the neck on one of them, two wrap their arms around you and pull you towards the ground onto your knees; prying the switchblade from your grasp, and holding it against your throat.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cGet off of me,\u201d you yell, and struggle against their hold; but it\u2019s no use. Nathan chuckles maliciously as he steps towards you, and you feel absolutely defenceless.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve waited a long time for this,\u201d he smirks as he saunters over, sticking out his hand to be given a large wooden stake from one of the goons.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWoah, wait,\u201d Jake starts yelling, as other vampires move to hold him back.\u00a0\u201cYou said if I brought her to you, you wouldn\u2019t hurt her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI lied,\u201d Nathan shrugs, and moves back to face you. You let out a nervous breath before replacing it with the last ounce of courage you have, and leaning back slightly before spitting in his face.\u00a0\u201cYou <i>bitch</i>!\u201d He raises his hand, and it soon makes harsh contact with your cheek. You gasp at the impact, but try not to let it faze you as you look back to him, and see him staring up at something. You try to look up as well but your head is aggressively forced back down to face the ground. Nathan starts chuckling again, and looks down at you as he licks his lips.\u00a0\u201cThis\u2019ll be fun.\u201d<br></p><p>With one final stride, and no warning; he stabs the stake swiftly into your gut, angling it up towards your heart. You gasp at the impact, and yell out at the pain as the piece of wood moves closer to your heart; only one move from killing you completely. Your gaze moves to Nathan once again, as he just stares down at you. You can feel your skin physically hardening, and greying; preparing for death\u2026 but it doesn\u2019t happen. Instead, Nathan removes the stake and quickly places his hands on either side of your head to twist it until there\u2019s another revolting crack; and everything goes black, yet again.\u00a0</p><p>\u2026 Little did you know that no more than a block or so away a brooding curly haired vampire sat on the edge of a roof; swaying his feet back and forth as he watched the people down below.\u00a0</p><p>Harry felt horrible for what he said to you back at the hotel, and was desperately trying to figure out how to make it up to you. He\u2019s known since the day he met you that you\u2019re the one he\u2019s supposed to end up with, but this time around his jealousy got the better of him when there was a mention of an ex-boyfriend of yours.\u00a0</p><p>Just as he was standing up to head back the hotel in hopes you\u2019d let him back in, his enhanced hearing picked up on a familiar voice in panic, and he froze.\u00a0\u201cGet off of me,\u201d it echoed in his ears, and he instantly started bolting in the direction the noise came from.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cY/N!\u201d He yelled, but knew you\u2019d more than likely not hear him. He finally reached the roof of the building he thought the noise came from, and glanced down into the alleyway that separated this building, and the one beside it.\u00a0<br></p><p>The first thing he witnessed was you being forced onto your knee\u2019s, as Nathan smacked his hand across your cheek while being surrounded by at least twenty other vampires; and that made his blood boil. He was about to intervene but froze in his tracks as Nathan glanced upwards, and locked eye contact with him. A sickening grin spread across his mouth as he started chuckling, and looked back down to you.\u00a0</p><p>Harry was about to hop down from the roof right then and there, but was stopped by a force yanking him backwards. He was quick getting to his feet just as the vampire opposite to him started charging towards him with a stake. Smoothly, he avoided the attack and was able to get ahold of the woman\u2019s neck; twisting it until she fell limp to the ground.\u00a0</p><p>In an instant, Harry was back at the edge of the roof just in time to see your grey lifeless body fall to the ground at Nathan\u2019s feet. An involuntary sob left his mouth at the sight, and caused the man who he thought just murdered the love of his life to look up at him with a taunting grin.\u00a0\u201cSorry for your loss, Styles,\u201d the murderer stated smugly before disappearing with your body, and the other vampires; all in the blink of an eye.\u00a0</p><p>taglist: <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfM-yUqulVOUviAjks88vew\">@alwaysjacked-up</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mhf8dINbmrPLdvlPy50LZjA\">@isitjamiemoriarty</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/md7v_RujD3qQwyWIeP1i63g\">@hrrysgirl</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJ9-xceeLtvXr003j4t6JCA\">@theasstour</a> GUY\u2019S I FINALLY WROTE PART 2 WOW</p></p>",
                "content": "<p><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"0\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><p><b>A/N:&nbsp;</b><a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3729721/\">Dylan O&rsquo;Brien</a> is Jake&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>Your eyes flutter open as the familiar sound of Brandon Flowers&rsquo; voice fills your ears, and you are more than a little pissed off; but also confused. Looking around, you note that you&rsquo;re laying on the leather backseat of a random car in what appears to be a McDonald&rsquo;s drive-thru. The sun shining brightly outside is a good indicator that you&rsquo;ve been passed out for quite sometime, and that leads you to finally move your gaze to the person who has caused this entire predicament. </p><p>In the driver&rsquo;s seat of the car Harry mindlessly taps his fingers against the steering wheel, and loudly sings along to the lyrics of &lsquo;Mr. Brightside&rsquo; as the chorus starts. He&rsquo;s in his own little world as he moves forward in the line, awaiting his turn to pay for his order and drive off; and unsurprisingly he hasn't&nbsp;noticed that you&rsquo;ve awoken.</p><p>You crack your stiff neck, as you slowly sit up and try your best not to start yelling at him. Your eyes remain locked on your curly haired best friend as he belts out the words of the song without flaw, and you pounce; wrapping your arm around his neck, and pulling him aggressively back against the carseat. &ldquo;You ASSHOLE!&rdquo; You growl, and glare into the rearview mirror so your eyes can lock with his. &ldquo;As if you snapped my neck on me <i>again. </i>That&rsquo;s low, even for you Harry.&rdquo; He struggles against you, but you just continue choking him with ease.&nbsp;</p><p>You begin thinking you&rsquo;ve gotten the upper hand against him, but are greatly mistaken as he reaches back to grab ahold of you, and flips you over into the passenger seat; causing your butt to miss it completely as you fall down between the dash and car seat, onto the floor. </p><p>&ldquo;Are you <i>insane</i>?&rdquo; He hisses. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s people watching, Y/N. Calm the hell down.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ask if I give a shit,&rdquo; you seethe, as you struggle to get yourself unstuck from the awkward position you&rsquo;re in. &ldquo;As soon as I get out of this&hellip; you&rsquo;re- you&rsquo;re-.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m what?&rdquo; He asks with a chuckle, enjoying watching you struggle. He leaves you be as he pulls up to the window, and the poor cashier looks completely taken aback by the scene in front of her. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s having a bit of a rough go,&rdquo; he tells the girl casually as you finally pull yourself onto the seat in an upright position. She just nods awkwardly and hands him the food, clearly not wanting to deal with any of this. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey,&rdquo; you say to the girl, and lean over across Harry to get a better look at her. &ldquo;Call the cops, this man is kidnapping me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Have a good day!&rdquo; Harry yells cheerily to cut you off, before rolling up the tinted window, and ripping out of the parking lot. You glare at him, as you let out numerous groans and huffs, all while trying to get comfy in the seat&hellip; only severely disappointed with the fact he has the child lock on, and you can&rsquo;t escape. &ldquo;Are you done?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; you state, and turn the volume of the stereo right down; trying to contain your annoyance with every little thing at the moment. </p><p>&ldquo;What- this is one of your favourite songs,&rdquo; he replies disbelieving as he turns the stereo back up. </p><p>&ldquo;Do I look like I&rsquo;m in the mood for The Killers right now?&rdquo; You snap, and he just laughs. &ldquo;Now where the hell are we?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ok first off,&rdquo; he starts and raises an eyebrow at you. &ldquo;M'sorry for snapping your neck, but we wouldn&rsquo;t even be out of New York if I didn&rsquo;t. Second, we&rsquo;re almost in Toronto.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Toronto</i>?&rdquo; You gasp, and glance out the window at the Canadian scenery. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been asleep for that long?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah I was just thinking that actually,&rdquo; he states. &ldquo;Y'know, before you <i>attacked</i> me. But eight hours is a long time, is everything alright with you? You should&rsquo;ve healed faster than that.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t had much blood other than what you gave me last night,&rdquo; you tell him and crack your neck again. </p><p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; he nods in understanding. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get you some as soon as we stop.&rdquo; You nod in agreement, and slowly move your gaze back out the window; letting the worry some thoughts slowly creep into your mind.</p><p>&ldquo;Harry?&rdquo; You ask quietly, knowing he&rsquo;ll be able to hear you. Without looking at him, you take a nervous breath; feeling his gaze burn into you as he waits for you to continue. &ldquo;What if he finds us?&rdquo;</p><p>He&nbsp;doesn&rsquo;t respond right away, but rather reaches across to gently grab ahold of your hand. His gesture catches you off guard, but you can&rsquo;t help the small smile the forms on your lips as he rubs his thumb over your knuckles.&nbsp;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he tells you honestly.&nbsp;&ldquo;But I know we&rsquo;ll be ok in the end, regardless of what happens.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And what makes you so sure?&rdquo; You ask curiously.&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m pretty positive he&rsquo;s not wanting to just have a nice chat with us after what happened two-hundred years ago, you know?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Well I can agree with that statement based on when I had that run-in with him, as well as the goons he sent after us,&rdquo; he replies, and you bite down on your bottom lip.&nbsp;&ldquo;But we&rsquo;ve also made it through the last two centuries together. Despite all the odds, we&rsquo;re still here&hellip; Somehow.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; you agree with a small laugh.&nbsp;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s when we became best friends.&nbsp;Who knew we&rsquo;d still be stuck with each other after all this time though? I mean, even as humans; no one wanted us to be together. Hell, everyone and their dog seemingly tried to keep us apart, but damn we were stubborn.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;We really were,&rdquo; he chuckles, and nods his head.&nbsp;&ldquo;Still don&rsquo;t know what caused you to make a move on me in the first place. I mean, yes we were close but&hellip;&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Me?&rdquo; You ask incredulously, and smack his arm.&nbsp;&ldquo;If&nbsp;I&rsquo;m not mistaken, you were the one who would send me suggestive glances first, and weren&rsquo;t <i>you</i> the one to pull <i>me</i>&nbsp;into the shadows as I was going up the estate&rsquo;s staircase to bed; before pushing me up against the wall and kissing me.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Ok you got me there,&rdquo; he says with an eye-roll, a smirk stretching across his mouth.&nbsp;&ldquo;Not my fault though, you just showed up out of the blue. I remember I had worked for that dick for almost a year before you arrived that chilly February day, m&rsquo;birthday actually. The sight of you climbing out of that horse carriage with your hair all done up, and wearing that ridiculous Victorian dress. I&rsquo;ll never forget it.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I <i>hated</i> those dresses,&rdquo; you state dramatically.&nbsp;&ldquo;I remember my father telling me how dressed up I needed to be to meet Nathan, seeing as he was prospected to be my suitor. And even on my first day there I could tell how awful of a person he was, just with the way he treated the people working for or even just around him. How he acted so rude and abusive towards you, and the other&rsquo;s&hellip; It was disgusting.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Which is why it was such a breathe of fresh air when you arrived,&rdquo; he continues.&nbsp;&ldquo;All of us adored you, Y/N. Even though we were the&nbsp;&lsquo;help,&rsquo; in the in the months you stayed there, you treated us like human beings rather than objects just there for your disposal like Nathan did. Didn&rsquo;t take me long to fall in love with you, despite the others warning me of what would happen if Nathan ever found out. Still can&rsquo;t believe you even gave me a chance.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You underestimate yourself,&rdquo; you tell him, and look back out the window to see the Toronto skyline appearing in the distance.&nbsp;&ldquo;I could never fall for someone so heartless and cruel like Nathan. You made me feel&hellip; wired, and full of excitement. Like I could finally live a bit of my life the way I wanted too, rather than how my father had planned out for me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why it didn&rsquo;t take much convincing for you to sneak around with me, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; He asks, and you nod your head.</p><p>&ldquo;Yep,&rdquo; you confirm with a laugh.&nbsp;&ldquo;Although it took you long enough to make the first move&hellip; But, I can only imagine where we&rsquo;d be if we didn&rsquo;t do any of that though.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do that,&rdquo; he says firmly, and squeezes your hand so you&rsquo;ll look at him.&nbsp;&ldquo;We loved each other, Y/N. Although they didn&rsquo;t necessarily agree with what we were doing; everyone called us soulmates, and it&rsquo;s not on us that what happened, happened. It&rsquo;s on Nathan. He couldn&rsquo;t stand the thought of me having something he wanted so badly, and it was disgusting how he treated you like a trophy. My heart broke each time I saw the two of you together, and I wanted nothing more than to just walk up and pull you away from him; but I couldn&rsquo;t. I knew what would happen if I did, and knew that just wasn&rsquo;t an option&hellip; And then he found out about us anyways.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Yeah&hellip;&rdquo; You trail off, and look down.&nbsp;&ldquo;We really did love each other, didn&rsquo;t we? And then Nathan basically locked me in my room after finding out. Moved the wedding up to Halloween, and then that wonderful night came along. Now look at us.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Just a couple of <i>wandering souls</i>,&rdquo;&nbsp;he states with a smirk, knowing he&rsquo;d get a reaction out of you with that being what he called the two of you as humans.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;With no where to go,&rdquo; you finish the statement, and roll your eyes at his cheesiness.&nbsp;&ldquo;Now can we please stop talking about the past, it&rsquo;s bumming me out.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;The past is catching up with us, Y/N,&rdquo; he tells you with a sigh.&nbsp;&ldquo;There&rsquo;s not much we can do to avoid it.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;We can try,&rdquo; you whisper, and go back to silently looking out the window for the remainder of the ride into Toronto.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>A couple of hours go by, and the two of you are now settled into a hotel room right downtown. You haven&rsquo;t said much else about the whole Nathan topic, but naturally that has to change.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I think we should come up with some sort of plan,&rdquo; Harry speaks up from the chair in the corner of the room, as you emerge from the washroom in a towel after showering. He looks you up and down, and you smirk cockily; thinking about what happened between the two of you last night.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;What for?&rdquo; You ask cluelessly in attempt to get a rise out of him.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Y/N, Nathan could be right behind us for all we know,&rdquo; he snaps.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I know, Harry,&rdquo; you yell right back.&nbsp;&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s also doubtful, Nathan wouldn&rsquo;t make himself known unless he needed too. Which I think is why he didn&rsquo;t show up last night, he wasn&rsquo;t nearby.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Or I just got us out of there before he could show up,&rdquo; your best friend murmurs to himself, causing you to groan.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Whatever,&rdquo; you snark, and move to the bag of clothes Harry stuffed full for you upon rushing out of your apartment.&nbsp;&ldquo;We should go grab a couple of drinks, have some fun, y&rsquo;know? It&rsquo;d beat staying around here stressing out all night.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>A cool breeze whips around, and you don&rsquo;t even have to turn around to know that Harry is now behind you.&nbsp;&ldquo;We could have some fun here,&rdquo; he suggests, and leans down to brush his lips against your neck; placing his hands on your hips.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;What happened to the blood we talked about getting upon arriving here?&rdquo; You ask smugly, and turn around to face him; allowing him to gently push you up against the wall.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;We could still get it,&rdquo; he replies, and speeds the two of you over to the bed so your back is on the mattress, as he hovers over you.&nbsp;&ldquo;In a little bit though.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Too bad I&rsquo;m <i>starving</i>,&rdquo; you tease as he begins placing love bites all along your collarbone once again.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Me too,&rdquo; he states, before moving his mouth to meet yours.&nbsp;&ldquo;But not just for blood.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>You kiss him back, but use your vampire abilities to quickly flip the two of you so you&rsquo;re above him; letting the towel fall slightly so it&rsquo;s the only thing separating your two&rsquo;s bodies pressed together.&nbsp;&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you get sick of this?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sick of what?&rdquo; He asks, and runs his fingers along your exposed skin; tracing your curves as he goes.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Us,&rdquo; you tell him, and feel as if a weight has been lifted off your chest in doing so.&nbsp;&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been doing this off and on for so long, and get nowhere with it. Yet, we always come back for more.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Could never get sick of yeh, petal,&rdquo; he explains, and your non-beating heart swells. You lean down to catch his lips with yours, and smile against them.&nbsp;&ldquo;Always am craving you.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;And to think I thought you only wanted me at first just in spite of Nathan,&rdquo; you continue, but have to stop as your cell phone dings from the bedside table. Your gaze snaps to it, but Harry places his fingers under your chin so your eyes meet his again.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Ignore it,&rdquo; he suggests, and you consider doing so; but decide against it as the phone dings again.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;No, I think it&rsquo;s Jake,&rdquo; you tell him, and roll out of his hold to go over and answer the phone; wrapping the towel back around you as you do so.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Jake?&rdquo; He asks accusingly.&nbsp;&ldquo;Who the hell is <i>Jake</i>?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;A friend&nbsp;I&rsquo;ve made over the years,&rdquo; you explain, and unlock your phone to see that it is indeed Jake texting you.&nbsp;&ldquo;An ex, actually. We still keep in contact, he&rsquo;s living here currently.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;And he&rsquo;s a vampire?&rdquo; Harry continues to grill, visibly getting grumpier.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Yes he&rsquo;s a vampire,&rdquo; you confirm, and take in your best friends body language.&nbsp;&ldquo;Wait. Are you jealous?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Ha,&rdquo; he says sarcastically.&nbsp;&ldquo;I am not jealous, Y/N. Just don&rsquo;t necessarily like the idea of meeting up with this guy.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Also know as, being jealous,&rdquo; you correct teasingly.&nbsp;&ldquo;Awwww is Harry mad that he&rsquo;s not getting my full attention? Wow, I am living for this.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t get jealous over someone who&rsquo;s just good for a couple of fucks every once in a while,&rdquo; he mumbles, and catches you completely off guard.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Pardon?&rdquo; You ask disbelieving, feeling as if someone has just reached into your chest and crushed your heart; the tears quickly filling your eyes as you choke back a sob.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Wait no, Y/N, I didn&rsquo;t mean it like that,&rdquo; he starts, and stands up from the bed to step towards you.&nbsp;&ldquo;You are so much more than th-.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Get out,&rdquo; you yell as the tears start streaming down your face.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Y/N listen,&rdquo; he tries to reason.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;GET OUT, HARRY!&rdquo; You yell, and grab ahold of the small lamp that resides on the table; yanking the cable out of the wall before chucking it across the room, and watching it shatter into the wall after it soars past the curly haired boy.&nbsp;&ldquo;Just&hellip; leave. I-I have nothing else to say to you.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>He looks from the mess on the floor to you, with absolute regret written across his face. You can basically sense the internal conflict he&rsquo;s having, and think he&rsquo;s going to come towards you; but he starts nodding his head in understanding instead.&nbsp;&ldquo;If that&rsquo;s what you want,&rdquo; he starts, and looks at you pleadingly; as if begging you to stop him from leaving.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Go,&rdquo; you tell him firmly, and he lets out a shaky breath.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Ok,&rdquo; he replies, and moves towards the door. He opens it and goes to step out, but pauses.&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Leave Harry!&rdquo; You yell once again, desperately, and this time he let&rsquo;s the door close behind him without another word; leaving you to breakdown all on your own.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Another hour passes, and you&rsquo;re still distraught. Harry has been the one constant thing in your life for so long, and to hear something like that from the person you will always love; is soul crushing.&nbsp;</p><p>You considered making a quick trip out of the hotel so you could feed before coming back, and sulking the night away alone; but Jake convinced you otherwise. Which now leads you to heading down to the hotel lobby, to meet up with your friend.&nbsp;</p><p>The elevator door dings open, as you smooth out your flowy top and tight jeans, to be met with the ginning face of one of your favourite vampires.&nbsp;&ldquo;Y/N!&rdquo; He greets enthusiastically, and opens his arms up.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Jake!&rdquo; You squeal, and rush towards him; engulfing him into a tight hug.&nbsp;&ldquo;How are you?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m good,&rdquo; he laughs, and gives you a squeeze before moving away slightly.&nbsp;&ldquo;Now how about we go get you those drinks now, yeah?&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Please,&rdquo; you groan, and motion for him to lead the way out of the hotel.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>The two of you make way down the streets of The Six, catching up, and just genuinely enjoying each other&rsquo;s company; which is really nice.&nbsp;&ldquo;I also have a girlfriend now,&rdquo; Jake begins to conclude his story.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo; You ask excitedly as you both turn down an alleyway, to what you assume is a shortcut to where you&rsquo;re are headed.&nbsp;&ldquo;Awe, that&rsquo;s awesome Jake.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, she&rsquo;s amazing,&rdquo; he tells you with a small grin.&nbsp;&ldquo;What about you? How&rsquo;s er-Harry? Is that his name?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Uhm, it&rsquo;s complicated,&rdquo; you start to explain, and continue walking forward; not noticing he&rsquo;s stopped. You take in your surroundings, noting how this alley get&rsquo;s sketchier the further you walk down it; suddenly getting a really bad vibe about it all.&nbsp;&ldquo;Hey Jake, are you sure this is the right way?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s not,&rdquo; a deep voice speaks up from behind you, and causes your heart to plummet into your stomach. You whip around, and sure enough the man himself stands there surrounded by goons; Jake standing uneasily in the midst of them.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Nathan,&rdquo; you whisper as you take in his familiar messy blonde hair, and try to stay calm despite the panic you feel building within you.&nbsp;&ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I think you know what I want, Y/N, don&rsquo;t play dumb,&rdquo; he replies, and steps forward; causing you to step back and bump into one of his men that now completely have you surrounded.&nbsp;&ldquo;I want you and Harry to suffer, obviously. But you&rsquo;re all on your own, hmm. Trouble in paradise, darling?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;No need to drag Harry into this when&nbsp;I&rsquo;m the one you have a grudge against,&rdquo; you spit through gritted teeth; glancing at all the other vampires that circle around you.&nbsp;&ldquo;Still unable to fight your own battles, I see.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Mmm they&rsquo;re just here to help make sure everything goes as planned,&rdquo; he states, and narrows his gaze at you.&nbsp;&ldquo;Also you&rsquo;re wrong there love, Harry took something that belonged to me&hellip; and for that he needs to pay.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Good luck with that,&rdquo; you state before whipping around and kneeing the closest vampire to you in the groin. He hunches over in pain, as you move to kick the next one in attempt to escape.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Grab her!&rdquo; Nathan seethes, and you start going at it. You grab the small wooden switchblade you stored in your boot just in case, and start swinging; getting a few good jabs at some of the vampires that try to grab onto you. Just as you&rsquo;re about to snap the neck on one of them, two wrap their arms around you and pull you towards the ground onto your knees; prying the switchblade from your grasp, and holding it against your throat.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Get off of me,&rdquo; you yell, and struggle against their hold; but it&rsquo;s no use. Nathan chuckles maliciously as he steps towards you, and you feel absolutely defenceless.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve waited a long time for this,&rdquo; he smirks as he saunters over, sticking out his hand to be given a large wooden stake from one of the goons.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Woah, wait,&rdquo; Jake starts yelling, as other vampires move to hold him back.&nbsp;&ldquo;You said if I brought her to you, you wouldn&rsquo;t hurt her.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I lied,&rdquo; Nathan shrugs, and moves back to face you. You let out a nervous breath before replacing it with the last ounce of courage you have, and leaning back slightly before spitting in his face.&nbsp;&ldquo;You <i>bitch</i>!&rdquo; He raises his hand, and it soon makes harsh contact with your cheek. You gasp at the impact, but try not to let it faze you as you look back to him, and see him staring up at something. You try to look up as well but your head is aggressively forced back down to face the ground. Nathan starts chuckling again, and looks down at you as he licks his lips.&nbsp;&ldquo;This&rsquo;ll be fun.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>With one final stride, and no warning; he stabs the stake swiftly into your gut, angling it up towards your heart. You gasp at the impact, and yell out at the pain as the piece of wood moves closer to your heart; only one move from killing you completely. Your gaze moves to Nathan once again, as he just stares down at you. You can feel your skin physically hardening, and greying; preparing for death&hellip; but it doesn&rsquo;t happen. Instead, Nathan removes the stake and quickly places his hands on either side of your head to twist it until there&rsquo;s another revolting crack; and everything goes black, yet again.&nbsp;</p><p>&hellip; Little did you know that no more than a block or so away a brooding curly haired vampire sat on the edge of a roof; swaying his feet back and forth as he watched the people down below.&nbsp;</p><p>Harry felt horrible for what he said to you back at the hotel, and was desperately trying to figure out how to make it up to you. He&rsquo;s known since the day he met you that you&rsquo;re the one he&rsquo;s supposed to end up with, but this time around his jealousy got the better of him when there was a mention of an ex-boyfriend of yours.&nbsp;</p><p>Just as he was standing up to head back the hotel in hopes you&rsquo;d let him back in, his enhanced hearing picked up on a familiar voice in panic, and he froze.&nbsp;&ldquo;Get off of me,&rdquo; it echoed in his ears, and he instantly started bolting in the direction the noise came from.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N!&rdquo; He yelled, but knew you&rsquo;d more than likely not hear him. He finally reached the roof of the building he thought the noise came from, and glanced down into the alleyway that separated this building, and the one beside it.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>The first thing he witnessed was you being forced onto your knee&rsquo;s, as Nathan smacked his hand across your cheek while being surrounded by at least twenty other vampires; and that made his blood boil. He was about to intervene but froze in his tracks as Nathan glanced upwards, and locked eye contact with him. A sickening grin spread across his mouth as he started chuckling, and looked back down to you.&nbsp;</p><p>Harry was about to hop down from the roof right then and there, but was stopped by a force yanking him backwards. He was quick getting to his feet just as the vampire opposite to him started charging towards him with a stake. Smoothly, he avoided the attack and was able to get ahold of the woman&rsquo;s neck; twisting it until she fell limp to the ground.&nbsp;</p><p>In an instant, Harry was back at the edge of the roof just in time to see your grey lifeless body fall to the ground at Nathan&rsquo;s feet. An involuntary sob left his mouth at the sight, and caused the man who he thought just murdered the love of his life to look up at him with a taunting grin.&nbsp;&ldquo;Sorry for your loss, Styles,&rdquo; the murderer stated smugly before disappearing with your body, and the other vampires; all in the blink of an eye.&nbsp;</p><p>taglist: <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfM-yUqulVOUviAjks88vew\">@alwaysjacked-up</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mhf8dINbmrPLdvlPy50LZjA\">@isitjamiemoriarty</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/md7v_RujD3qQwyWIeP1i63g\">@hrrysgirl</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJ9-xceeLtvXr003j4t6JCA\">@theasstour</a> GUY&rsquo;S I FINALLY WROTE PART 2 WOW</p></p>",

Looking around, you note that you&rsquo;re laying on the leather backseat of a random car in what appears to be a McDonald&rsquo;s drive-thru. The sun shining brightly outside is a good indicator that you&rsquo;ve been passed out for quite sometime, and that leads you to finally move your gaze to the person who has caused this entire predicament. </p>\n<p>In the driver&rsquo;s seat of the car Harry mindlessly taps his fingers against the steering wheel, and loudly sings along to the lyrics of &lsquo;Mr. Brightside&rsquo; as the chorus starts. He&rsquo;s in his own little world as he moves forward in the line, awaiting his turn to pay for his order and drive off; and unsurprisingly he hasn't&nbsp;noticed that you&rsquo;ve awoken.</p>\n<p>You crack your stiff neck, as you slowly sit up and try your best not to start yelling at him. Your eyes remain locked on your curly haired best friend as he belts out the words of the song without flaw, and you pounce; wrapping your arm around his neck, and pulling him aggressively back against the carseat. &ldquo;You ASSHOLE!&rdquo; You growl, and glare into the rearview mirror so your eyes can lock with his. &ldquo;As if you snapped my neck on me <i>again. </i>That&rsquo;s low, even for you Harry.&rdquo; He struggles against you, but you just continue choking him with ease.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You begin thinking you&rsquo;ve gotten the upper hand against him, but are greatly mistaken as he reaches back to grab ahold of you, and flips you over into the passenger seat; causing your butt to miss it completely as you fall down between the dash and car seat, onto the floor. </p>\n</p>",

He\u2019d arrived onto the bus after having stayed a while to meet some fans after the show, taking a little longer than usual.

It reminded him of his starting days with the boys and it was a sort of nostalgia he wasn\u2019t ready to let go of just yet.</p><p>\u201cI can see that, love,\u201d he chuckled as he looked at the various pictures. They were all of you two, some seemingly romantic and others obviously taken in drunken states with your heads being laughed off. They were all the good times you\u2019d managed to document while you were on tour with him. </p><p>\u201cWell, you know I\u2019m going back home because the semester is starting,\u201d You began.</p><p>\u201cWhich you know you don\u2019t have to do if you don\u2019t want to. I can provide for both of us,\u201d Harry interjected. He was sad to spend any time apart from you and he was more than willing to provide for you if you decided to stay. In fact, he was more than ready to provide for you for the rest of your life, but he knew better than to think you\u2019d take the offer.</p><p>\u201cHarry, we\u2019ve talked about this. I\u2019m trying to get a degree! I want to be something in life!\u201d you laughed at his small pout, \u201cWe can\u2019t all be famous singers, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but you can be a famous singer\u2019s wife,\u201d Harry replied with a sly smile. Your attention snapped towards him, your eyes wide.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t joke like that, Styles,\u201d you warned. He chuckled at your response before pulling you to your feet and into his arms. His hand reached up to caress your cheek as his tone lowered.</p><p>\u201cM\u2019not joking. You know I want to marry you,\u201d he said softly. His thumbs grazed the skin of your cheeks delicately as if scared that he\u2019d somehow harm you. </p><p>\u201cYou want to marry me now just so I won\u2019t go away,\u201d you accused, a teasing smile on your face as his fingers trailed down to your jawline. He grinned devilishly as his eyes sparkled at your accusation. </p><p>\u201cAbsolutely right, doll,\u201d he placed a kiss on your lips that made you swoon, only to be held upright by his arms. \u201cI\u2019d do anything to keep you here with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTour is almost over,\u201d You pointed out, \u201cI won\u2019t be missing much. Then you can stay with me for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn your dorm?\u201d he asked with a mischievous smile, \u201ccan\u2019t say your roommate would be fond of the noise. Y\u2019know how rowdy we can get when I haven\u2019t seen you.\u201d</p><p>You blushed furiously at his insinuation and attempted to hide your face, only to have your hands pried away from your eyes. </p><p>\u201cShy, love? Don\u2019t like when I talk about us that way?\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that,\u201d you quickly denied. \u201cI just hadn\u2019t quite thought of that situation just yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2018M surprised you haven\u2019t, but thankfully I have. Came up with a solution, actually.\u201d You raised an eyebrow, begging him to go on. \u201cI\u2019ve bought a house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, for you and f\u2019me,\u201d he replied with a bright smile. \u201cIt\u2019s not much, if I\u2019m being honest. Quite a humble home, but it\u2019s warm and comforting and right by your school. We can be at peace there.\u201d</p><p>Harry wrapped his arms around your waist and pulled you in, the scent of sweat and cologne dripping off of him as he placed small kisses along your neck.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s that sound, doll?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely lovely.\u201d</p>",
