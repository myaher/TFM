She\u2019s made the same mistake in the second chorus so many times, now she tenses up at the first notes. Unlike Roderick, Elife knows how to calm her; they take deep breaths and tell jokes, then Alison gives it another try.</p><p>\u201cOh my god, Ali, you did it!\u201d</p><p>They hug, and Alison sags in relief against her friend.</p><p>\u201cDrinks are on me tonight,\u201d Elife says</p><p>\u201cThanks, but I don\u2019t think I can go out tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me get this straight: you\u2019re refusing to go out on a Friday night even if I offered to pay for your drinks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got choir practice early tomorrow morning, and for once I\u2019m not working the late shift.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly, you\u2019re not working. C\u2019mon, you haven\u2019t gone out in a month. It\u2019s my birthday. You\u2019re no fun anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know but I should practice some more and I want to get a good night sleep. Mr. Peterson stares daggers at me every time I so much as yawn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAli, this is insane. He is insane. Everyone says so.\u201d</p><!-- more --><p>Roderick may be an extremely demanding conductor, but under his tutelage she\u2019s improving by leaps and bonds.</p><p>Since beginning the choir last month, Alison has worked harder than she ever has in her whole life, or so it seems. They practice five days a week for three hours, and he expects them to exercise outside too. He gives assignments and songs to memorize by the next day, some of them in bloody latin. She and her colleagues now refer to the choir practices as drills.</p><p>When she isn\u2019t practicing with the choir or Elife, she studies partitions to improve her sight-reading abilities, listens to choral music, and completes Buzzfeed quizzes on \u201cWhich classical composer are you?\u201d. Music sheets hang all around the flat, on the fridge, beside the bathroom mirror, inside cupboards. Even at work, she quizzes herself on the music playing in the pub, does breathing exercises behind the bar and hides lyrics in her waitress pad. At night, she dreams of choral hymns and Roderick.</p><p>In short, she\u2019s obsessed. But it feels amazing to be so driven. She fears that one moment of relaxation will take her right back to her old habits.</p><p>So, just in case hard work isn\u2019t enough, she has taken to arriving earlier for choir practices. She goes to the coffee shop in front of the theatre where Roderick goes too. She\u2019ll have a tea\u2014 the pumpkin spice stuff is out now\u2014 and pores over her music sheets so he\u2019ll notice her studiousness. If she\u2019s lucky, they\u2019ll arrive at the counter at the same time and exchange a few words. In those moments, he\u2019s not quite in his conductor role yet, he indulges in small talk and his smile comes quicker. She learns he swims every morning from the red-rimmed eyes and messy hair.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t catch a cold,\u201d he says, eyeing her bare legs when it\u2019s nearly October.</p><p>The next day she\u2019s in tights, black ones with a golden shimmer.</p><p>\u201cBetter?\u201d she asks, raising a leg with pointed toes.</p><p>\u201cOf course you would wear ones with glitter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd of course you would be wearing another polo neck.\u201d</p><p>He huffs, but she doesn\u2019t miss the little twitch at the corners of his mouth.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s classic.\u201d</p><p>The tactics she uses aren\u2019t unlike the ones she used in school to become the teacher\u2019s pet: offer to make copies, stay after class to rearrange the room, and so on.</p><p>If her strategy works, it doesn\u2019t show during rehearsals.</p><p>All her life, people have been lenient with her: her teachers, her parents, her bosses, her husband. She could get away with a lot of things thanks to her good looks and sweet disposition. But Roderick is having none of that. Either she excels or she\u2019s expelled. And she wants to excel.</p><p>It\u2019s obvious that he has a lot of experience with building a choir from the ground up. Although he\u2019s impatient (\u201dTen year-olds mastered this quicker than you did.\u201d), his confidence in his methods inspires them.</p><p>On top of group exercises, he also teaches them one-on-one. They use the theatre basement as a practice space. On each side there are smaller, soundproof rooms designed for personal training. Alison both fears and enjoys these individual sessions. The low ceiling accentuates Roderick\u2019s height and his face shows no sign of humour. His critical ears dissect every sound that comes out of her mouth. Nothing escapes his sharp gaze. She feels so exposed, yet relishes his undivided attention. But in the end, even if he\u2019s impossible to please, it\u2019s the precision of his feedback that kicks her performance up a notch every week.</p><p>Despite these improvements and always putting her right front and centre, he still gives most of the solos to Clarissa, sometimes to other girls, never to her. The way he glances at her sometimes while Clarissa sings, makes her wonder if he does it on purpose, to spur her on. When frustration gets the better of her, she holds the note longer with unnecessary vibrato a la Christina Aguilera to outdo the others. Even if he gives her the stink eye&ndash; and so does the rest of the choir&ndash; it momentarily alleviates her irritation.</p><p>By October, Roderick has ejected one man from the group for coming to a practice hungover. Tension runs high. Everyone is a rival. Alison is wary of anyone who\u2019s being nice. She\u2019s not as suspicious of the men, as they\u2019re not her direct competition. Marcus, in particular, she gets along well.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re jealous of Clarissa,\u201d he remarks one day.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not fair,\u201d she replies like a petulant child. \u201cI think a choir should be an equal opportunities type of thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure that\u2019s what it\u2019s about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat else could it be?\u201d</p><p>Marcus hums \u201cHot for teacher\u201d. Heat rises to Alison\u2019s cheeks, but she scoffs at the idea. That\u2019s crazy. She admires him, but that\u2019s a totally different thing. He\u2019s not unattractive, but he\u2019s not her type. And she\u2019s certainly not his, he\u2019s made that abundantly clear. Besides, he\u2019s a jerk, pitting them against each other that way to make them work harder for his own glory. It\u2019s working, but the choristers\u2019 morale is at its lowest.</p><p>All this time spent on the choir, and the one-hour commute to the theatre, means less time with her friends and less shifts at the pub and therefore less money. Javier, at the Blue Bear, accommodates her, but he has a business to run. No matter how much he likes Alison, he has to give her shifts away to other waitresses.</p><p>By mid-October, Alison has dark circles under her eyes no makeup can cover. She often falls asleep on the bus and regularly fights with Elife over trivial things. The shorter hours of sunlight and gloomy weather isn\u2019t helping. She misses being alone on stage, the crowd\u2019s energy, their gazes on her, their applause, it filled a need that the choir doesn\u2019t. But Roderick announced they would give a concert at the beginning of December, which promises to finally give her the best of both world. That is, if he tolerates her presence in the choir that long.</p><p>Roderick fires another chorister, and she\u2019s convinced she\u2019s next. At night, thoughts of quitting keep her awake. But if she quits, she\u2019ll be back at square one, back to no musical career to speak of, having wasted two months of the last year she has to make it big. Of course, it\u2019s a bit silly to think her career opportunities will be over after 25, some people get a start much later in life. But she can\u2019t let herself think about that. If there\u2019s on thing she\u2019s learned from working with Roderick it\u2019s that she can\u2019t be indulgent with herself. If she gives herself an inch, she will take a mile.</p><p>If only she could get some sign that joining the choir was the right decision.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s mail for you,\u201d Elife says.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you making that face?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s from a solicitor.\u201d</p><p>Alison has to read the letter three times to make sense of all the legal terms. But after three times, the amount remains the same: 7000\u00a3.</p><p>Elife reads over her shoulder. \u201cJohn? Isn\u2019t that your ex-husband? He\u2019s suing you for \u2018emotional distress\u2019. What the bloody hell?\u201d</p><p>A sudden coldness hits Alison\u2019s core. She stumbles to the living room and drops down on the couch.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have that kind of money\u2026 I\u2019ll have to quit the choir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? No. You\u2019re not paying him. You left three years ago and suddenly he\u2019s distressed? I bet he just wants to see you again, get your attention.\u201d</p><p>Alison hugs her knees.</p><p>The truth is she did treat John badly. She pretended to be in love with him to have a place to stay after she was kicked out of her flat. She wasn\u2019t supposed to be married to him for two years, but he adored her, and she couldn\u2019t resist that. He gave her a job and a house, and she was the star of the karaoke. Then she cheated with the first man who said he was in show business and left John without a word of explanation.</p><p>\u201cHow old were you when you met him?\u201d Elife asks.</p><p>\u201c19.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow old was he?\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2026 40. I always preferred older men.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe should have known better.\u201d</p><p>Alison doesn\u2019t argue. She avoids thinking about her relationship with John as it always prompts waves of guilt. But maybe he isn\u2019t so innocent in all of this.</p><p>There\u2019s a contact number at the bottom of the letter, she will call the solicitor this week as well as an old friend in Canterbury to figure out what prompted this accusation from John.</p><p>She feels like she has an iceberg inside her stomach, heavy and cold. She can imagine no positive outcome to this situation. She should quit the choir to work more hours. Anyway, Roderick has given no signs that he really wants her there. What\u2019s the point if it won\u2019t lead to career opportunities?</p><p>But the thing is, despite the fatigue and strained atmosphere, she loves the choir. When they sing together, all their voices blend in such a beautiful harmony, she forgets the rivalry and her need for attention, time slows and a feeling of being in sync with the world washes over her. Always, she walks out smiling and looking forward to the next rehearsal.</p><p>\u266a</p><p>As co-owner of the Lux Aeterna theatre, Roderick has his own office on the second floor of the building. He\u2019s designed it himself: a warm shade of white on the walls and a simple glass desk. Minimalism helps him focus. He appreciates the music more when his other senses are not solicited. For much the same reason, he wears similar outfits everyday, he doesn\u2019t care to waste mental energy on such trivial decisions as clothing.</p><p>From his window overlooking the intersection, he spots Alison crossing the road to the coffeehouse. Now there\u2019s someone who is not a minimalist by any stretch of the imagination. She always has some colourful accessories on from dangling earrings to shimmering tights or, today, a scarf with a large floral print. She very much solicits his other senses. She\u2019s like a peacock, whereas he\u2019s more like the female of that species, and, well, he should stop thinking about her in aviary metaphors. </p><p>He\u2019s slipping on his coat to go out for coffee too when he stops himself. Already twice this week he met her there. What if someone saw them? He can\u2019t afford wagging tongues who would accuse him of partiality.</p><p>Alison has been on his list of \u201cspare choristers\u201d since the beginning. He chose her for her looks, but when competition comes, a great rack won\u2019t compensate for a poor voice. He hadn\u2019t count on her exceeding his expectations. She\u2019s improved steadily through the weeks and showed a dedication to their work (if not to the choir itself as demonstrated by her attempts at standing out from the group). She deserves to sing solo parts, but he can\u2019t risk antagonizing Clarissa. </p><p>Choirs across Britain seek Clarissa as a member, and Roderick won her by cashing in a favour. Five years ago, she suffered from an Adderall addiction caused by the high amount of pressure put on students of the Music Academy. A breakdown during exams jeopardized her acceptance in the Master\u2019s program, but Roderick convinced the deanship to give her a chance. She owes him, but for how long? He needs her to win the national competition and restore his reputation.</p><p>Glancing at his watch, he reconsiders his decision to forgo coffee and Alison, but Vera decides for him. The theatre manager comes into his office, wearing that leather jacket she keeps for important meetings. </p><p>\u201cHow did it go?\u201d Roderick asks.</p><p>\u201cThey are interested in investing in the choir. But before committing they asked to watch today\u2019s session.\u201d</p><p>Roderick rubs the back of his neck. A year ago, his name as choir director would have been enough for their patronage, now they need extra reassurance.</p><p>\u201cWhat do I tell them?\u201d Vera asks.</p><p>\u201cOf course they can. Make them feel as welcome as possible. By the way, how are the ticket sales for the December concert?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re selling.\u201d</p><p>He invites her to elaborate with a hand movement.</p><p>\u201cNot as fast as we\u2019d hoped, but\u2026 steadily. Maybe it\u2019s because of that letter to the editor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat letter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the last issue of The Gramophone. It\u2019s nothing, forget it,\u201d Vera says, but Roderick is already at his computer, doing research. \u201cWe need more staff for the bar and the ticket booth. I\u2019ll email you the ad I wrote.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmhmm,\u201d he says without taking his eyes off the screen. </p><p>The letter in question calls for stricter rules in music competitions \u201cto avoid such debacles as last year\u2019s \u2018A Song for Christmas\u2019,\u201d it says. Although his name isn\u2019t mentioned as such, it\u2019s clearly about him and his \u201cshameful behaviour\u201d. </p><p>Roderick removes his glasses and rubs a hand down his face. Today\u2019s choir practice has better be perfect.</p><p>In the mirror behind his office door, he smooths his hair and arranges the collar of his sweater, he likes it snug around his neck.</p><p>\u201cInhale success\u2026 Exhale doubt.\u201d</p><p>In the lobby of the theatre, Alison is already fulfilling her duty without being aware of it: she\u2019s chatting with the potential investors. Hands in the back pockets of her tight jeans, she\u2019s pitching her voice higher than natural in a way that makes her sound younger. By all accounts, she\u2019s flirting, but her laughter sounds strained to him.</p><p>\u201cHey, Mr Peterson.\u201d She waves at him. \u201cI didn\u2019t see you for coffee as usual today.\u201d</p><p>He frowns at her choice of words. Other choristers in the lobby glance between them. He crosses his hands behind his back.</p><p>\u201cI would hardly call a handful of coincidences \u2018usual\u2019, miss Crosby.\u201d</p><p>She flinches at his cold tone, and a hint of guilt surprises him. </p><p>\u201cRight, of course not,\u201d she says. \u201cI just meant that it happens sometimes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOff you go, we\u2019re about to start.\u201d</p><p>With his pupils, Roderick runs through the familiar warm-ups. He can\u2019t see the two investors, they\u2019re somewhere on a dark balcony, yet he feels their gazes like burning coals on the back of his skull.</p><p>He rubs his moist palms on his trousers before picking up his baton and tapping it lightly against the lectern. They begin with Mendelssohn\u2019s \u201cMagnificat\u201d in which Clarissa sings a solo. She\u2019s the perfect chorister, disciplined and consistent. He focuses on her and makes a point not to look at Alison. But he hears her, always a little louder than the others, and out of the corner of his eye, he catches her stepping out.</p><p><i>Not now</i>.</p><p>He can tell by the annotations his students quickly strike or scribble on their partitions that his directions are inconsistent.</p><p>Marcus\u2019s voice squeaks. Abel rocks on his feet. Janet is off by half an octave. Every mistake rings in his ears like nails on a blackboard. They\u2019ve practiced this piece before, multiple times, why are they failing him now?</p><p>His jaw clenches. His neck strains. He jerks the baton without finesse.</p><p>The song ends, and he takes a measured breath. The choristers are silent, aware something is going on.</p><p>\u201cDo you seek to humiliate me?\u201d he shouts.</p><p>A collective gasp echoes in the empty theatre.</p><p>\u201cFrom the top. Do better.\u201d</p><p>The second time isn\u2019t as bad, but control slips out of his grasp like the baton from his clammy hand.</p><p>\u201cClarissa, wasn\u2019t that a little high for you?\u201d Alison says at the end.</p><p>\u201cMiss Crosby,\u201d he snaps. \u201cBackstage. Now!\u201d</p><p>They stride off the stage, out of earshot, into the dressing-room.</p><p>She hangs her head sheepishly, but he doesn\u2019t miss the smile she fights to suppress.</p><p>\u201cAre you enjoying acting like a brat? I\u2019ve taught children who were more mature than you. Why are you doing this to me? Today of all days. Do you wish to sabotage my work? You are not worthy of my choir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen fire me and get it over with, you\u2019ve been wanting to do so since day one. You obviously don\u2019t care about me&ndash;\u201d He holds up a closed fist, the signal he uses to end a song. \u201cDid you just conduct me to shut up?\u201d</p><p>Hands on hips, she steps up to him. He looks down her nose at her.</p><p>\u201cThe more you try to make it all about you, the less it will be,\u201d he threatens.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not trying to do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you are! There is no \u2018I\u2019 in choir, miss Crosby.\u201d </p><p>She has just enough survival instincts to hold back a laughter. He deflates slightly.</p><p>\u201cChoral, I meant, no \u2018I\u2019 in choral. My point is there is no room for your ego in this ensemble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Mr Peterson.\u201d She wrings her hands and sniffs. \u201cI\u2019ve received some bad news yesterday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t use that voice with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m upset, is all. I feel like\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not your psychoanalyst.\u201d</p><p>She groans and paces the floor. \u201cI don\u2019t understand what you want from me. Why did you choose me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re sexy.\u201d His tone is nothing but snide. \u201cI think I can use you to sway the male judges. You were certainly willing enough to wield your sexuality over me.\u201d</p><p>Her jaw drops, and she shakes her head. \u201cYou\u2019re just like the others,\u201d she murmurs.</p><p>He backpedals, \u201cAnd for your voice, of course. And stage presence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re using me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs you are using me,\u201d he counters.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did you want to join my choir?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRoderick, c\u2019mon. Because I like it.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhen we met, you said you were a singer. Are you using the choir to advance your own career?\u201d</p><p>She avoids his gaze and bites the inside of her cheeks. She huffs a breath and jabs a finger on his chest.</p><p>\u201cYou know what? You\u2019re one to talk.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhat is that supposed to mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean that you\u2019re the one making this choir all about you. <i>Your </i>success, not ours. It\u2019s all about <i>your </i>ego.\u201d This time when she pokes him, he grabs her hand.</p><p>\u201cI am the conductor, the most important person here. And they understand this.\u201d He points towards the stage.</p><p>\u201cYeah, your minions.\u201d Alison scoffs in his face.</p><p>\u201cYou must respect my authority.\u201d</p><p>Their noses are inches apart now. Alison\u2019s cheeks burn, she breathes shallowly.</p><p>\u201cWhat is this, bloody South Korea?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019ll find you meant North Korea.\u201d</p><p>She jerks her arm out of his grasp. \u201cWhatever, mate.\u201d </p><p>\u201cMate?\u201d</p><p>She sits on the corner of a table, her back hunched. She stares at her hands with vacant eyes. </p><p>He removes his glasses and pinches the bridge of his nose. After a moment of hesitation, he sits down next to her. He should go back to the auditorium, and go on with the rehearsal, but he stays backstage, with Alison. </p><p>\u201cWhat did you mean \u2018today of all days\u2019? When we came in, you said that.\u201d Her voice is faint, she\u2019s still not looking at him.</p><p>\u201cThere were potential investors watching us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInvestors?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was hoping to get a sponsorship deal for the choir. I know the rehearsals are time-consuming and you all have other monetary obligations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow, I really fucked up.\u201d She laughs bitterly. </p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat why you were so stressed out?\u201d</p><p>Had it been so obvious? </p><p>She searches his face, and he fights the urge to put his glasses back on.</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t mind me asking, what is the bad news you received?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cEm, well, ironically enough it\u2019s about money\u2014 don\u2019t correct me if that\u2019s not what irony is.\u201d Roderick closes his mouth. \u201cSomeone is suing me for a lot of money. I work at a pub, so I\u2019m not exactly rich and the choir is really cutting into my working hours. I don\u2019t want to quit, I love it, but I don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsk Vera, my associate, we\u2019re looking for extra staff here at the theatre.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you think that would help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe, if I could work right after or before rehearsals, then I wouldn\u2019t lose all that time on the bus,\u201d she muses out loud. She rubs her thumb in her palm, then looks up at him. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I said you don\u2019t care about us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cApology accepted. And, well, I\u2019m sorry I called you a brat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am, though.\u201d</p><p>They chuckle, and suddenly Alison\u2019s arms are around him. He freezes. He\u2019s not the kind of person people usually want to hug. A slow smile spreads over his lips, and he pats her back.</p><hr><p><a href=\"http://lostinfic.tumblr.com/post/181783142399/dissonance-and-harmony-5\">Part 5</a></p>",

Mr. Peterson stares daggers at me every time I so much as yawn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAli, this is insane. He is insane. Everyone says so.\u201d</p>[[MORE]]<p>Roderick may be an extremely demanding conductor, but under his tutelage she\u2019s improving by leaps and bonds.</p><p>Since beginning the choir last month, Alison has worked harder than she ever has in her whole life, or so it seems. They practice five days a week for three hours, and he expects them to exercise outside too. He gives assignments and songs to memorize by the next day, some of them in bloody latin. She and her colleagues now refer to the choir practices as drills.</p><p>When she isn\u2019t practicing with the choir or Elife, she studies partitions to improve her sight-reading abilities, listens to choral music, and completes Buzzfeed quizzes on \u201cWhich classical composer are you?\u201d. Music sheets hang all around the flat, on the fridge, beside the bathroom mirror, inside cupboards. Even at work, she quizzes herself on the music playing in the pub, does breathing exercises behind the bar and hides lyrics in her waitress pad. At night, she dreams of choral hymns and Roderick.</p><p>In short, she\u2019s obsessed. But it feels amazing to be so driven. She fears that one moment of relaxation will take her right back to her old habits.</p><p>So, just in case hard work isn\u2019t enough, she has taken to arriving earlier for choir practices. She goes to the coffee shop in front of the theatre where Roderick goes too. She\u2019ll have a tea\u2014 the pumpkin spice stuff is out now\u2014 and pores over her music sheets so he\u2019ll notice her studiousness. If she\u2019s lucky, they\u2019ll arrive at the counter at the same time and exchange a few words. In those moments, he\u2019s not quite in his conductor role yet, he indulges in small talk and his smile comes quicker. She learns he swims every morning from the red-rimmed eyes and messy hair.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t catch a cold,\u201d he says, eyeing her bare legs when it\u2019s nearly October.</p><p>The next day she\u2019s in tights, black ones with a golden shimmer.</p><p>\u201cBetter?\u201d she asks, raising a leg with pointed toes.</p><p>\u201cOf course you would wear ones with glitter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd of course you would be wearing another polo neck.\u201d</p><p>He huffs, but she doesn\u2019t miss the little twitch at the corners of his mouth.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s classic.\u201d</p><p>The tactics she uses aren\u2019t unlike the ones she used in school to become the teacher\u2019s pet: offer to make copies, stay after class to rearrange the room, and so on.</p><p>If her strategy works, it doesn\u2019t show during rehearsals.</p><p>All her life, people have been lenient with her: her teachers, her parents, her bosses, her husband. She could get away with a lot of things thanks to her good looks and sweet disposition. But Roderick is having none of that. Either she excels or she\u2019s expelled. And she wants to excel.</p><p>It\u2019s obvious that he has a lot of experience with building a choir from the ground up. Although he\u2019s impatient (\u201dTen year-olds mastered this quicker than you did.\u201d), his confidence in his methods inspires them.</p><p>On top of group exercises, he also teaches them one-on-one. They use the theatre basement as a practice space. On each side there are smaller, soundproof rooms designed for personal training. Alison both fears and enjoys these individual sessions. The low ceiling accentuates Roderick\u2019s height and his face shows no sign of humour. His critical ears dissect every sound that comes out of her mouth. Nothing escapes his sharp gaze. She feels so exposed, yet relishes his undivided attention. But in the end, even if he\u2019s impossible to please, it\u2019s the precision of his feedback that kicks her performance up a notch every week.</p><p>Despite these improvements and always putting her right front and centre, he still gives most of the solos to Clarissa, sometimes to other girls, never to her. The way he glances at her sometimes while Clarissa sings, makes her wonder if he does it on purpose, to spur her on. When frustration gets the better of her, she holds the note longer with unnecessary vibrato a la Christina Aguilera to outdo the others. Even if he gives her the stink eye\u2013 and so does the rest of the choir\u2013 it momentarily alleviates her irritation.</p><p>By October, Roderick has ejected one man from the group for coming to a practice hungover. Tension runs high. Everyone is a rival. Alison is wary of anyone who\u2019s being nice. She\u2019s not as suspicious of the men, as they\u2019re not her direct competition. Marcus, in particular, she gets along well.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re jealous of Clarissa,\u201d he remarks one day.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not fair,\u201d she replies like a petulant child. \u201cI think a choir should be an equal opportunities type of thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure that\u2019s what it\u2019s about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat else could it be?\u201d</p><p>Marcus hums \u201cHot for teacher\u201d. Heat rises to Alison\u2019s cheeks, but she scoffs at the idea. That\u2019s crazy. She admires him, but that\u2019s a totally different thing. He\u2019s not unattractive, but he\u2019s not her type. And she\u2019s certainly not his, he\u2019s made that abundantly clear. Besides, he\u2019s a jerk, pitting them against each other that way to make them work harder for his own glory. It\u2019s working, but the choristers\u2019 morale is at its lowest.</p><p>All this time spent on the choir, and the one-hour commute to the theatre, means less time with her friends and less shifts at the pub and therefore less money. Javier, at the Blue Bear, accommodates her, but he has a business to run. No matter how much he likes Alison, he has to give her shifts away to other waitresses.</p><p>By mid-October, Alison has dark circles under her eyes no makeup can cover. She often falls asleep on the bus and regularly fights with Elife over trivial things. The shorter hours of sunlight and gloomy weather isn\u2019t helping. She misses being alone on stage, the crowd\u2019s energy, their gazes on her, their applause, it filled a need that the choir doesn\u2019t. But Roderick announced they would give a concert at the beginning of December, which promises to finally give her the best of both world. That is, if he tolerates her presence in the choir that long.</p><p>Roderick fires another chorister, and she\u2019s convinced she\u2019s next. At night, thoughts of quitting keep her awake. But if she quits, she\u2019ll be back at square one, back to no musical career to speak of, having wasted two months of the last year she has to make it big. Of course, it\u2019s a bit silly to think her career opportunities will be over after 25, some people get a start much later in life. But she can\u2019t let herself think about that. If there\u2019s on thing she\u2019s learned from working with Roderick it\u2019s that she can\u2019t be indulgent with herself. If she gives herself an inch, she will take a mile.</p><p>If only she could get some sign that joining the choir was the right decision.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s mail for you,\u201d Elife says.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you making that face?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s from a solicitor.\u201d</p><p>Alison has to read the letter three times to make sense of all the legal terms. But after three times, the amount remains the same: 7000\u00a3.</p><p>Elife reads over her shoulder. \u201cJohn? Isn\u2019t that your ex-husband? He\u2019s suing you for \u2018emotional distress\u2019. What the bloody hell?\u201d</p><p>A sudden coldness hits Alison\u2019s core. She stumbles to the living room and drops down on the couch.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have that kind of money\u2026 I\u2019ll have to quit the choir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? No. You\u2019re not paying him. You left three years ago and suddenly he\u2019s distressed? I bet he just wants to see you again, get your attention.\u201d</p><p>Alison hugs her knees.</p><p>The truth is she did treat John badly. She pretended to be in love with him to have a place to stay after she was kicked out of her flat. She wasn\u2019t supposed to be married to him for two years, but he adored her, and she couldn\u2019t resist that. He gave her a job and a house, and she was the star of the karaoke. Then she cheated with the first man who said he was in show business and left John without a word of explanation.</p><p>\u201cHow old were you when you met him?\u201d Elife asks.</p><p>\u201c19.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow old was he?\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2026 40. I always preferred older men.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe should have known better.\u201d</p><p>Alison doesn\u2019t argue. She avoids thinking about her relationship with John as it always prompts waves of guilt. But maybe he isn\u2019t so innocent in all of this.</p><p>There\u2019s a contact number at the bottom of the letter, she will call the solicitor this week as well as an old friend in Canterbury to figure out what prompted this accusation from John.</p><p>She feels like she has an iceberg inside her stomach, heavy and cold. She can imagine no positive outcome to this situation. She should quit the choir to work more hours. Anyway, Roderick has given no signs that he really wants her there. What\u2019s the point if it won\u2019t lead to career opportunities?</p><p>But the thing is, despite the fatigue and strained atmosphere, she loves the choir. When they sing together, all their voices blend in such a beautiful harmony, she forgets the rivalry and her need for attention, time slows and a feeling of being in sync with the world washes over her. Always, she walks out smiling and looking forward to the next rehearsal.</p><p>\u266a</p><p>As co-owner of the Lux Aeterna theatre, Roderick has his own office on the second floor of the building. He\u2019s designed it himself: a warm shade of white on the walls and a simple glass desk. Minimalism helps him focus. He appreciates the music more when his other senses are not solicited. For much the same reason, he wears similar outfits everyday, he doesn\u2019t care to waste mental energy on such trivial decisions as clothing.</p><p>From his window overlooking the intersection, he spots Alison crossing the road to the coffeehouse. Now there\u2019s someone who is not a minimalist by any stretch of the imagination. She always has some colourful accessories on from dangling earrings to shimmering tights or, today, a scarf with a large floral print. She very much solicits his other senses. She\u2019s like a peacock, whereas he\u2019s more like the female of that species, and, well, he should stop thinking about her in aviary metaphors. </p><p>He\u2019s slipping on his coat to go out for coffee too when he stops himself. Already twice this week he met her there. What if someone saw them? He can\u2019t afford wagging tongues who would accuse him of partiality.</p><p>Alison has been on his list of \u201cspare choristers\u201d since the beginning. He chose her for her looks, but when competition comes, a great rack won\u2019t compensate for a poor voice. He hadn\u2019t count on her exceeding his expectations. She\u2019s improved steadily through the weeks and showed a dedication to their work (if not to the choir itself as demonstrated by her attempts at standing out from the group). She deserves to sing solo parts, but he can\u2019t risk antagonizing Clarissa. </p><p>Choirs across Britain seek Clarissa as a member, and Roderick won her by cashing in a favour. Five years ago, she suffered from an Adderall addiction caused by the high amount of pressure put on students of the Music Academy. A breakdown during exams jeopardized her acceptance in the Master\u2019s program, but Roderick convinced the deanship to give her a chance. She owes him, but for how long? He needs her to win the national competition and restore his reputation.</p><p>Glancing at his watch, he reconsiders his decision to forgo coffee and Alison, but Vera decides for him. The theatre manager comes into his office, wearing that leather jacket she keeps for important meetings. </p><p>\u201cHow did it go?\u201d Roderick asks.</p><p>\u201cThey are interested in investing in the choir. But before committing they asked to watch today\u2019s session.\u201d</p><p>Roderick rubs the back of his neck. A year ago, his name as choir director would have been enough for their patronage, now they need extra reassurance.</p><p>\u201cWhat do I tell them?\u201d Vera asks.</p><p>\u201cOf course they can. Make them feel as welcome as possible. By the way, how are the ticket sales for the December concert?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re selling.\u201d</p><p>He invites her to elaborate with a hand movement.</p><p>\u201cNot as fast as we\u2019d hoped, but\u2026 steadily. Maybe it\u2019s because of that letter to the editor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat letter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the last issue of The Gramophone. It\u2019s nothing, forget it,\u201d Vera says, but Roderick is already at his computer, doing research. \u201cWe need more staff for the bar and the ticket booth. I\u2019ll email you the ad I wrote.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmhmm,\u201d he says without taking his eyes off the screen. </p><p>The letter in question calls for stricter rules in music competitions \u201cto avoid such debacles as last year\u2019s \u2018A Song for Christmas\u2019,\u201d it says. Although his name isn\u2019t mentioned as such, it\u2019s clearly about him and his \u201cshameful behaviour\u201d. </p><p>Roderick removes his glasses and rubs a hand down his face. Today\u2019s choir practice has better be perfect.</p><p>In the mirror behind his office door, he smooths his hair and arranges the collar of his sweater, he likes it snug around his neck.</p><p>\u201cInhale success\u2026 Exhale doubt.\u201d</p><p>In the lobby of the theatre, Alison is already fulfilling her duty without being aware of it: she\u2019s chatting with the potential investors. Hands in the back pockets of her tight jeans, she\u2019s pitching her voice higher than natural in a way that makes her sound younger. By all accounts, she\u2019s flirting, but her laughter sounds strained to him.</p><p>\u201cHey, Mr Peterson.\u201d She waves at him. \u201cI didn\u2019t see you for coffee as usual today.\u201d</p><p>He frowns at her choice of words. Other choristers in the lobby glance between them. He crosses his hands behind his back.</p><p>\u201cI would hardly call a handful of coincidences \u2018usual\u2019, miss Crosby.\u201d</p><p>She flinches at his cold tone, and a hint of guilt surprises him. </p><p>\u201cRight, of course not,\u201d she says. \u201cI just meant that it happens sometimes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOff you go, we\u2019re about to start.\u201d</p><p>With his pupils, Roderick runs through the familiar warm-ups. He can\u2019t see the two investors, they\u2019re somewhere on a dark balcony, yet he feels their gazes like burning coals on the back of his skull.</p><p>He rubs his moist palms on his trousers before picking up his baton and tapping it lightly against the lectern. They begin with Mendelssohn\u2019s \u201cMagnificat\u201d in which Clarissa sings a solo. She\u2019s the perfect chorister, disciplined and consistent. He focuses on her and makes a point not to look at Alison. But he hears her, always a little louder than the others, and out of the corner of his eye, he catches her stepping out.</p><p><i>Not now</i>.</p><p>He can tell by the annotations his students quickly strike or scribble on their partitions that his directions are inconsistent.</p><p>Marcus\u2019s voice squeaks. Abel rocks on his feet. Janet is off by half an octave. Every mistake rings in his ears like nails on a blackboard. They\u2019ve practiced this piece before, multiple times, why are they failing him now?</p><p>His jaw clenches. His neck strains. He jerks the baton without finesse.</p><p>The song ends, and he takes a measured breath. The choristers are silent, aware something is going on.</p><p>\u201cDo you seek to humiliate me?\u201d he shouts.</p><p>A collective gasp echoes in the empty theatre.</p><p>\u201cFrom the top. Do better.\u201d</p><p>The second time isn\u2019t as bad, but control slips out of his grasp like the baton from his clammy hand.</p><p>\u201cClarissa, wasn\u2019t that a little high for you?\u201d Alison says at the end.</p><p>\u201cMiss Crosby,\u201d he snaps. \u201cBackstage. Now!\u201d</p><p>They stride off the stage, out of earshot, into the dressing-room.</p><p>She hangs her head sheepishly, but he doesn\u2019t miss the smile she fights to suppress.</p><p>\u201cAre you enjoying acting like a brat? I\u2019ve taught children who were more mature than you. Why are you doing this to me? Today of all days. Do you wish to sabotage my work? You are not worthy of my choir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen fire me and get it over with, you\u2019ve been wanting to do so since day one. You obviously don\u2019t care about me\u2013\u201d He holds up a closed fist, the signal he uses to end a song. \u201cDid you just conduct me to shut up?\u201d</p><p>Hands on hips, she steps up to him. He looks down her nose at her.</p><p>\u201cThe more you try to make it all about you, the less it will be,\u201d he threatens.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not trying to do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you are! There is no \u2018I\u2019 in choir, miss Crosby.\u201d </p><p>She has just enough survival instincts to hold back a laughter. He deflates slightly.</p><p>\u201cChoral, I meant, no \u2018I\u2019 in choral. My point is there is no room for your ego in this ensemble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Mr Peterson.\u201d She wrings her hands and sniffs. \u201cI\u2019ve received some bad news yesterday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t use that voice with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m upset, is all. I feel like\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not your psychoanalyst.\u201d</p><p>She groans and paces the floor. \u201cI don\u2019t understand what you want from me. Why did you choose me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re sexy.\u201d His tone is nothing but snide. \u201cI think I can use you to sway the male judges. You were certainly willing enough to wield your sexuality over me.\u201d</p><p>Her jaw drops, and she shakes her head. \u201cYou\u2019re just like the others,\u201d she murmurs.</p><p>He backpedals, \u201cAnd for your voice, of course. And stage presence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re using me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs you are using me,\u201d he counters.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did you want to join my choir?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRoderick, c\u2019mon. Because I like it.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhen we met, you said you were a singer. Are you using the choir to advance your own career?\u201d</p><p>She avoids his gaze and bites the inside of her cheeks. She huffs a breath and jabs a finger on his chest.</p><p>\u201cYou know what? You\u2019re one to talk.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhat is that supposed to mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean that you\u2019re the one making this choir all about you. <i>Your </i>success, not ours. It\u2019s all about <i>your </i>ego.\u201d This time when she pokes him, he grabs her hand.</p><p>\u201cI am the conductor, the most important person here. And they understand this.\u201d He points towards the stage.</p><p>\u201cYeah, your minions.\u201d Alison scoffs in his face.</p><p>\u201cYou must respect my authority.\u201d</p><p>Their noses are inches apart now. Alison\u2019s cheeks burn, she breathes shallowly.</p><p>\u201cWhat is this, bloody South Korea?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019ll find you meant North Korea.\u201d</p><p>She jerks her arm out of his grasp. \u201cWhatever, mate.\u201d </p><p>\u201cMate?\u201d</p><p>She sits on the corner of a table, her back hunched. She stares at her hands with vacant eyes. </p><p>He removes his glasses and pinches the bridge of his nose. After a moment of hesitation, he sits down next to her. He should go back to the auditorium, and go on with the rehearsal, but he stays backstage, with Alison. </p><p>\u201cWhat did you mean \u2018today of all days\u2019? When we came in, you said that.\u201d Her voice is faint, she\u2019s still not looking at him.</p><p>\u201cThere were potential investors watching us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInvestors?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was hoping to get a sponsorship deal for the choir. I know the rehearsals are time-consuming and you all have other monetary obligations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow, I really fucked up.\u201d She laughs bitterly. </p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat why you were so stressed out?\u201d</p><p>Had it been so obvious? </p><p>She searches his face, and he fights the urge to put his glasses back on.</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t mind me asking, what is the bad news you received?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cEm, well, ironically enough it\u2019s about money\u2014 don\u2019t correct me if that\u2019s not what irony is.\u201d Roderick closes his mouth. \u201cSomeone is suing me for a lot of money. I work at a pub, so I\u2019m not exactly rich and the choir is really cutting into my working hours. I don\u2019t want to quit, I love it, but I don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsk Vera, my associate, we\u2019re looking for extra staff here at the theatre.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you think that would help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe, if I could work right after or before rehearsals, then I wouldn\u2019t lose all that time on the bus,\u201d she muses out loud. She rubs her thumb in her palm, then looks up at him. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I said you don\u2019t care about us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cApology accepted. And, well, I\u2019m sorry I called you a brat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am, though.\u201d</p><p>They chuckle, and suddenly Alison\u2019s arms are around him. He freezes. He\u2019s not the kind of person people usually want to hug. A slow smile spreads over his lips, and he pats her back.</p><hr><p><a href=\"http://lostinfic.tumblr.com/post/181783142399/dissonance-and-harmony-5\">Part 5</a></p></p>",

She\u2019s made the same mistake in the second chorus so many times, now she tenses up at the first notes. Unlike Roderick, Elife knows how to calm her; they take deep breaths and tell jokes, then Alison gives it another try.</p><p>\u201cOh my god, Ali, you did it!\u201d</p><p>They hug, and Alison sags in relief against her friend.</p><p>\u201cDrinks are on me tonight,\u201d Elife says</p><p>\u201cThanks, but I don\u2019t think I can go out tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me get this straight: you\u2019re refusing to go out on a Friday night even if I offered to pay for your drinks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got choir practice early tomorrow morning, and for once I\u2019m not working the late shift.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly, you\u2019re not working. C\u2019mon, you haven\u2019t gone out in a month. It\u2019s my birthday. You\u2019re no fun anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know but I should practice some more and I want to get a good night sleep. Mr. Peterson stares daggers at me every time I so much as yawn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAli, this is insane. He is insane. Everyone says so.\u201d</p>[[MORE]]<p>Roderick may be an extremely demanding conductor, but under his tutelage she\u2019s improving by leaps and bonds.</p><p>Since beginning the choir last month, Alison has worked harder than she ever has in her whole life, or so it seems. They practice five days a week for three hours, and he expects them to exercise outside too. He gives assignments and songs to memorize by the next day, some of them in bloody latin. She and her colleagues now refer to the choir practices as drills.</p><p>When she isn\u2019t practicing with the choir or Elife, she studies partitions to improve her sight-reading abilities, listens to choral music, and completes Buzzfeed quizzes on \u201cWhich classical composer are you?\u201d. Music sheets hang all around the flat, on the fridge, beside the bathroom mirror, inside cupboards. Even at work, she quizzes herself on the music playing in the pub, does breathing exercises behind the bar and hides lyrics in her waitress pad. At night, she dreams of choral hymns and Roderick.</p><p>In short, she\u2019s obsessed. But it feels amazing to be so driven. She fears that one moment of relaxation will take her right back to her old habits.</p><p>So, just in case hard work isn\u2019t enough, she has taken to arriving earlier for choir practices. She goes to the coffee shop in front of the theatre where Roderick goes too. She\u2019ll have a tea\u2014 the pumpkin spice stuff is out now\u2014 and pores over her music sheets so he\u2019ll notice her studiousness. If she\u2019s lucky, they\u2019ll arrive at the counter at the same time and exchange a few words. In those moments, he\u2019s not quite in his conductor role yet, he indulges in small talk and his smile comes quicker. She learns he swims every morning from the red-rimmed eyes and messy hair.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t catch a cold,\u201d he says, eyeing her bare legs when it\u2019s nearly October.</p><p>The next day she\u2019s in tights, black ones with a golden shimmer.</p><p>\u201cBetter?\u201d she asks, raising a leg with pointed toes.</p><p>\u201cOf course you would wear ones with glitter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd of course you would be wearing another polo neck.\u201d</p><p>He huffs, but she doesn\u2019t miss the little twitch at the corners of his mouth.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s classic.\u201d</p><p>The tactics she uses aren\u2019t unlike the ones she used in school to become the teacher\u2019s pet: offer to make copies, stay after class to rearrange the room, and so on.</p><p>If her strategy works, it doesn\u2019t show during rehearsals.</p><p>All her life, people have been lenient with her: her teachers, her parents, her bosses, her husband. She could get away with a lot of things thanks to her good looks and sweet disposition. But Roderick is having none of that. Either she excels or she\u2019s expelled. And she wants to excel.</p><p>It\u2019s obvious that he has a lot of experience with building a choir from the ground up. Although he\u2019s impatient (\u201dTen year-olds mastered this quicker than you did.\u201d), his confidence in his methods inspires them.</p><p>On top of group exercises, he also teaches them one-on-one. They use the theatre basement as a practice space. On each side there are smaller, soundproof rooms designed for personal training. Alison both fears and enjoys these individual sessions. The low ceiling accentuates Roderick\u2019s height and his face shows no sign of humour. His critical ears dissect every sound that comes out of her mouth. Nothing escapes his sharp gaze. She feels so exposed, yet relishes his undivided attention. But in the end, even if he\u2019s impossible to please, it\u2019s the precision of his feedback that kicks her performance up a notch every week.</p><p>Despite these improvements and always putting her right front and centre, he still gives most of the solos to Clarissa, sometimes to other girls, never to her. The way he glances at her sometimes while Clarissa sings, makes her wonder if he does it on purpose, to spur her on. When frustration gets the better of her, she holds the note longer with unnecessary vibrato a la Christina Aguilera to outdo the others. Even if he gives her the stink eye\u2013 and so does the rest of the choir\u2013 it momentarily alleviates her irritation.</p><p>By October, Roderick has ejected one man from the group for coming to a practice hungover. Tension runs high. Everyone is a rival. Alison is wary of anyone who\u2019s being nice. She\u2019s not as suspicious of the men, as they\u2019re not her direct competition. Marcus, in particular, she gets along well.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re jealous of Clarissa,\u201d he remarks one day.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not fair,\u201d she replies like a petulant child. \u201cI think a choir should be an equal opportunities type of thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure that\u2019s what it\u2019s about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat else could it be?\u201d</p><p>Marcus hums \u201cHot for teacher\u201d. Heat rises to Alison\u2019s cheeks, but she scoffs at the idea. That\u2019s crazy. She admires him, but that\u2019s a totally different thing. He\u2019s not unattractive, but he\u2019s not her type. And she\u2019s certainly not his, he\u2019s made that abundantly clear. Besides, he\u2019s a jerk, pitting them against each other that way to make them work harder for his own glory. It\u2019s working, but the choristers\u2019 morale is at its lowest.</p><p>All this time spent on the choir, and the one-hour commute to the theatre, means less time with her friends and less shifts at the pub and therefore less money. Javier, at the Blue Bear, accommodates her, but he has a business to run. No matter how much he likes Alison, he has to give her shifts away to other waitresses.</p><p>By mid-October, Alison has dark circles under her eyes no makeup can cover. She often falls asleep on the bus and regularly fights with Elife over trivial things. The shorter hours of sunlight and gloomy weather isn\u2019t helping. She misses being alone on stage, the crowd\u2019s energy, their gazes on her, their applause, it filled a need that the choir doesn\u2019t. But Roderick announced they would give a concert at the beginning of December, which promises to finally give her the best of both world. That is, if he tolerates her presence in the choir that long.</p><p>Roderick fires another chorister, and she\u2019s convinced she\u2019s next. At night, thoughts of quitting keep her awake. But if she quits, she\u2019ll be back at square one, back to no musical career to speak of, having wasted two months of the last year she has to make it big. Of course, it\u2019s a bit silly to think her career opportunities will be over after 25, some people get a start much later in life. But she can\u2019t let herself think about that. If there\u2019s on thing she\u2019s learned from working with Roderick it\u2019s that she can\u2019t be indulgent with herself. If she gives herself an inch, she will take a mile.</p><p>If only she could get some sign that joining the choir was the right decision.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s mail for you,\u201d Elife says.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you making that face?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s from a solicitor.\u201d</p><p>Alison has to read the letter three times to make sense of all the legal terms. But after three times, the amount remains the same: 7000\u00a3.</p><p>Elife reads over her shoulder. \u201cJohn? Isn\u2019t that your ex-husband? He\u2019s suing you for \u2018emotional distress\u2019. What the bloody hell?\u201d</p><p>A sudden coldness hits Alison\u2019s core. She stumbles to the living room and drops down on the couch.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have that kind of money\u2026 I\u2019ll have to quit the choir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? No. You\u2019re not paying him. You left three years ago and suddenly he\u2019s distressed? I bet he just wants to see you again, get your attention.\u201d</p><p>Alison hugs her knees.</p><p>The truth is she did treat John badly. She pretended to be in love with him to have a place to stay after she was kicked out of her flat. She wasn\u2019t supposed to be married to him for two years, but he adored her, and she couldn\u2019t resist that. He gave her a job and a house, and she was the star of the karaoke. Then she cheated with the first man who said he was in show business and left John without a word of explanation.</p><p>\u201cHow old were you when you met him?\u201d Elife asks.</p><p>\u201c19.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow old was he?\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2026 40. I always preferred older men.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe should have known better.\u201d</p><p>Alison doesn\u2019t argue. She avoids thinking about her relationship with John as it always prompts waves of guilt. But maybe he isn\u2019t so innocent in all of this.</p><p>There\u2019s a contact number at the bottom of the letter, she will call the solicitor this week as well as an old friend in Canterbury to figure out what prompted this accusation from John.</p><p>She feels like she has an iceberg inside her stomach, heavy and cold. She can imagine no positive outcome to this situation. She should quit the choir to work more hours. Anyway, Roderick has given no signs that he really wants her there. What\u2019s the point if it won\u2019t lead to career opportunities?</p><p>But the thing is, despite the fatigue and strained atmosphere, she loves the choir. When they sing together, all their voices blend in such a beautiful harmony, she forgets the rivalry and her need for attention, time slows and a feeling of being in sync with the world washes over her. Always, she walks out smiling and looking forward to the next rehearsal.</p><p>\u266a</p><p>As co-owner of the Lux Aeterna theatre, Roderick has his own office on the second floor of the building. He\u2019s designed it himself: a warm shade of white on the walls and a simple glass desk. Minimalism helps him focus. He appreciates the music more when his other senses are not solicited. For much the same reason, he wears similar outfits everyday, he doesn\u2019t care to waste mental energy on such trivial decisions as clothing.</p><p>From his window overlooking the intersection, he spots Alison crossing the road to the coffeehouse. Now there\u2019s someone who is not a minimalist by any stretch of the imagination. She always has some colourful accessories on from dangling earrings to shimmering tights or, today, a scarf with a large floral print. She very much solicits his other senses. She\u2019s like a peacock, whereas he\u2019s more like the female of that species, and, well, he should stop thinking about her in aviary metaphors. </p><p>He\u2019s slipping on his coat to go out for coffee too when he stops himself. Already twice this week he met her there. What if someone saw them? He can\u2019t afford wagging tongues who would accuse him of partiality.</p><p>Alison has been on his list of \u201cspare choristers\u201d since the beginning. He chose her for her looks, but when competition comes, a great rack won\u2019t compensate for a poor voice. He hadn\u2019t count on her exceeding his expectations. She\u2019s improved steadily through the weeks and showed a dedication to their work (if not to the choir itself as demonstrated by her attempts at standing out from the group). She deserves to sing solo parts, but he can\u2019t risk antagonizing Clarissa. </p><p>Choirs across Britain seek Clarissa as a member, and Roderick won her by cashing in a favour. Five years ago, she suffered from an Adderall addiction caused by the high amount of pressure put on students of the Music Academy. A breakdown during exams jeopardized her acceptance in the Master\u2019s program, but Roderick convinced the deanship to give her a chance. She owes him, but for how long? He needs her to win the national competition and restore his reputation.</p><p>Glancing at his watch, he reconsiders his decision to forgo coffee and Alison, but Vera decides for him. The theatre manager comes into his office, wearing that leather jacket she keeps for important meetings. </p><p>\u201cHow did it go?\u201d Roderick asks.</p><p>\u201cThey are interested in investing in the choir. But before committing they asked to watch today\u2019s session.\u201d</p><p>Roderick rubs the back of his neck. A year ago, his name as choir director would have been enough for their patronage, now they need extra reassurance.</p><p>\u201cWhat do I tell them?\u201d Vera asks.</p><p>\u201cOf course they can. Make them feel as welcome as possible. By the way, how are the ticket sales for the December concert?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re selling.\u201d</p><p>He invites her to elaborate with a hand movement.</p><p>\u201cNot as fast as we\u2019d hoped, but\u2026 steadily. Maybe it\u2019s because of that letter to the editor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat letter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the last issue of The Gramophone. It\u2019s nothing, forget it,\u201d Vera says, but Roderick is already at his computer, doing research. \u201cWe need more staff for the bar and the ticket booth. I\u2019ll email you the ad I wrote.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmhmm,\u201d he says without taking his eyes off the screen. </p><p>The letter in question calls for stricter rules in music competitions \u201cto avoid such debacles as last year\u2019s \u2018A Song for Christmas\u2019,\u201d it says. Although his name isn\u2019t mentioned as such, it\u2019s clearly about him and his \u201cshameful behaviour\u201d. </p><p>Roderick removes his glasses and rubs a hand down his face. Today\u2019s choir practice has better be perfect.</p><p>In the mirror behind his office door, he smooths his hair and arranges the collar of his sweater, he likes it snug around his neck.</p><p>\u201cInhale success\u2026 Exhale doubt.\u201d</p><p>In the lobby of the theatre, Alison is already fulfilling her duty without being aware of it: she\u2019s chatting with the potential investors. Hands in the back pockets of her tight jeans, she\u2019s pitching her voice higher than natural in a way that makes her sound younger. By all accounts, she\u2019s flirting, but her laughter sounds strained to him.</p><p>\u201cHey, Mr Peterson.\u201d She waves at him. \u201cI didn\u2019t see you for coffee as usual today.\u201d</p><p>He frowns at her choice of words. Other choristers in the lobby glance between them. He crosses his hands behind his back.</p><p>\u201cI would hardly call a handful of coincidences \u2018usual\u2019, miss Crosby.\u201d</p><p>She flinches at his cold tone, and a hint of guilt surprises him. </p><p>\u201cRight, of course not,\u201d she says. \u201cI just meant that it happens sometimes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOff you go, we\u2019re about to start.\u201d</p><p>With his pupils, Roderick runs through the familiar warm-ups. He can\u2019t see the two investors, they\u2019re somewhere on a dark balcony, yet he feels their gazes like burning coals on the back of his skull.</p><p>He rubs his moist palms on his trousers before picking up his baton and tapping it lightly against the lectern. They begin with Mendelssohn\u2019s \u201cMagnificat\u201d in which Clarissa sings a solo. She\u2019s the perfect chorister, disciplined and consistent. He focuses on her and makes a point not to look at Alison. But he hears her, always a little louder than the others, and out of the corner of his eye, he catches her stepping out.</p><p><i>Not now</i>.</p><p>He can tell by the annotations his students quickly strike or scribble on their partitions that his directions are inconsistent.</p><p>Marcus\u2019s voice squeaks. Abel rocks on his feet. Janet is off by half an octave. Every mistake rings in his ears like nails on a blackboard. They\u2019ve practiced this piece before, multiple times, why are they failing him now?</p><p>His jaw clenches. His neck strains. He jerks the baton without finesse.</p><p>The song ends, and he takes a measured breath. The choristers are silent, aware something is going on.</p><p>\u201cDo you seek to humiliate me?\u201d he shouts.</p><p>A collective gasp echoes in the empty theatre.</p><p>\u201cFrom the top. Do better.\u201d</p><p>The second time isn\u2019t as bad, but control slips out of his grasp like the baton from his clammy hand.</p><p>\u201cClarissa, wasn\u2019t that a little high for you?\u201d Alison says at the end.</p><p>\u201cMiss Crosby,\u201d he snaps. \u201cBackstage. Now!\u201d</p><p>They stride off the stage, out of earshot, into the dressing-room.</p><p>She hangs her head sheepishly, but he doesn\u2019t miss the smile she fights to suppress.</p><p>\u201cAre you enjoying acting like a brat? I\u2019ve taught children who were more mature than you. Why are you doing this to me? Today of all days. Do you wish to sabotage my work? You are not worthy of my choir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen fire me and get it over with, you\u2019ve been wanting to do so since day one. You obviously don\u2019t care about me\u2013\u201d He holds up a closed fist, the signal he uses to end a song. \u201cDid you just conduct me to shut up?\u201d</p><p>Hands on hips, she steps up to him. He looks down her nose at her.</p><p>\u201cThe more you try to make it all about you, the less it will be,\u201d he threatens.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not trying to do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you are! There is no \u2018I\u2019 in choir, miss Crosby.\u201d </p><p>She has just enough survival instincts to hold back a laughter. He deflates slightly.</p><p>\u201cChoral, I meant, no \u2018I\u2019 in choral. My point is there is no room for your ego in this ensemble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Mr Peterson.\u201d She wrings her hands and sniffs. \u201cI\u2019ve received some bad news yesterday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t use that voice with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m upset, is all. I feel like\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not your psychoanalyst.\u201d</p><p>She groans and paces the floor. \u201cI don\u2019t understand what you want from me. Why did you choose me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re sexy.\u201d His tone is nothing but snide. \u201cI think I can use you to sway the male judges. You were certainly willing enough to wield your sexuality over me.\u201d</p><p>Her jaw drops, and she shakes her head. \u201cYou\u2019re just like the others,\u201d she murmurs.</p><p>He backpedals, \u201cAnd for your voice, of course. And stage presence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re using me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs you are using me,\u201d he counters.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did you want to join my choir?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRoderick, c\u2019mon. Because I like it.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhen we met, you said you were a singer. Are you using the choir to advance your own career?\u201d</p><p>She avoids his gaze and bites the inside of her cheeks. She huffs a breath and jabs a finger on his chest.</p><p>\u201cYou know what? You\u2019re one to talk.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhat is that supposed to mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean that you\u2019re the one making this choir all about you. <i>Your </i>success, not ours. It\u2019s all about <i>your </i>ego.\u201d This time when she pokes him, he grabs her hand.</p><p>\u201cI am the conductor, the most important person here. And they understand this.\u201d He points towards the stage.</p><p>\u201cYeah, your minions.\u201d Alison scoffs in his face.</p><p>\u201cYou must respect my authority.\u201d</p><p>Their noses are inches apart now. Alison\u2019s cheeks burn, she breathes shallowly.</p><p>\u201cWhat is this, bloody South Korea?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019ll find you meant North Korea.\u201d</p><p>She jerks her arm out of his grasp. \u201cWhatever, mate.\u201d </p><p>\u201cMate?\u201d</p><p>She sits on the corner of a table, her back hunched. She stares at her hands with vacant eyes. </p><p>He removes his glasses and pinches the bridge of his nose. After a moment of hesitation, he sits down next to her. He should go back to the auditorium, and go on with the rehearsal, but he stays backstage, with Alison. </p><p>\u201cWhat did you mean \u2018today of all days\u2019? When we came in, you said that.\u201d Her voice is faint, she\u2019s still not looking at him.</p><p>\u201cThere were potential investors watching us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInvestors?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was hoping to get a sponsorship deal for the choir. I know the rehearsals are time-consuming and you all have other monetary obligations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow, I really fucked up.\u201d She laughs bitterly. </p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat why you were so stressed out?\u201d</p><p>Had it been so obvious? </p><p>She searches his face, and he fights the urge to put his glasses back on.</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t mind me asking, what is the bad news you received?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cEm, well, ironically enough it\u2019s about money\u2014 don\u2019t correct me if that\u2019s not what irony is.\u201d Roderick closes his mouth. \u201cSomeone is suing me for a lot of money. I work at a pub, so I\u2019m not exactly rich and the choir is really cutting into my working hours. I don\u2019t want to quit, I love it, but I don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsk Vera, my associate, we\u2019re looking for extra staff here at the theatre.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you think that would help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe, if I could work right after or before rehearsals, then I wouldn\u2019t lose all that time on the bus,\u201d she muses out loud. She rubs her thumb in her palm, then looks up at him. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I said you don\u2019t care about us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cApology accepted. And, well, I\u2019m sorry I called you a brat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am, though.\u201d</p><p>They chuckle, and suddenly Alison\u2019s arms are around him. He freezes. He\u2019s not the kind of person people usually want to hug. A slow smile spreads over his lips, and he pats her back.</p><hr><p><a href=\"http://lostinfic.tumblr.com/post/181783142399/dissonance-and-harmony-5\">Part 5</a></p></p>",

She&rsquo;s made the same mistake in the second chorus so many times, now she tenses up at the first notes. Unlike Roderick, Elife knows how to calm her; they take deep breaths and tell jokes, then Alison gives it another try.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh my god, Ali, you did it!&rdquo;</p><p>They hug, and Alison sags in relief against her friend.</p><p>&ldquo;Drinks are on me tonight,&rdquo; Elife says</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks, but I don&rsquo;t think I can go out tonight.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Let me get this straight: you&rsquo;re refusing to go out on a Friday night even if I offered to pay for your drinks?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got choir practice early tomorrow morning, and for once I&rsquo;m not working the late shift.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Exactly, you&rsquo;re not working. C&rsquo;mon, you haven&rsquo;t gone out in a month. It&rsquo;s my birthday. You&rsquo;re no fun anymore.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know but I should practice some more and I want to get a good night sleep. Mr. Peterson stares daggers at me every time I so much as yawn.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ali, this is insane. He is insane. Everyone says so.&rdquo;</p><p>Roderick may be an extremely demanding conductor, but under his tutelage she&rsquo;s improving by leaps and bonds.</p><p>Since beginning the choir last month, Alison has worked harder than she ever has in her whole life, or so it seems. They practice five days a week for three hours, and he expects them to exercise outside too. He gives assignments and songs to memorize by the next day, some of them in bloody latin. She and her colleagues now refer to the choir practices as drills.</p><p>When she isn&rsquo;t practicing with the choir or Elife, she studies partitions to improve her sight-reading abilities, listens to choral music, and completes Buzzfeed quizzes on &ldquo;Which classical composer are you?&rdquo;. Music sheets hang all around the flat, on the fridge, beside the bathroom mirror, inside cupboards. Even at work, she quizzes herself on the music playing in the pub, does breathing exercises behind the bar and hides lyrics in her waitress pad. At night, she dreams of choral hymns and Roderick.</p><p>In short, she&rsquo;s obsessed. But it feels amazing to be so driven. She fears that one moment of relaxation will take her right back to her old habits.</p><p>So, just in case hard work isn&rsquo;t enough, she has taken to arriving earlier for choir practices. She goes to the coffee shop in front of the theatre where Roderick goes too. She&rsquo;ll have a tea&mdash; the pumpkin spice stuff is out now&mdash; and pores over her music sheets so he&rsquo;ll notice her studiousness. If she&rsquo;s lucky, they&rsquo;ll arrive at the counter at the same time and exchange a few words. In those moments, he&rsquo;s not quite in his conductor role yet, he indulges in small talk and his smile comes quicker. She learns he swims every morning from the red-rimmed eyes and messy hair.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t catch a cold,&rdquo; he says, eyeing her bare legs when it&rsquo;s nearly October.</p><p>The next day she&rsquo;s in tights, black ones with a golden shimmer.</p><p>&ldquo;Better?&rdquo; she asks, raising a leg with pointed toes.</p><p>&ldquo;Of course you would wear ones with glitter.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And of course you would be wearing another polo neck.&rdquo;</p><p>He huffs, but she doesn&rsquo;t miss the little twitch at the corners of his mouth.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s classic.&rdquo;</p><p>The tactics she uses aren&rsquo;t unlike the ones she used in school to become the teacher&rsquo;s pet: offer to make copies, stay after class to rearrange the room, and so on.</p><p>If her strategy works, it doesn&rsquo;t show during rehearsals.</p><p>All her life, people have been lenient with her: her teachers, her parents, her bosses, her husband. She could get away with a lot of things thanks to her good looks and sweet disposition. But Roderick is having none of that. Either she excels or she&rsquo;s expelled. And she wants to excel.</p><p>It&rsquo;s obvious that he has a lot of experience with building a choir from the ground up. Although he&rsquo;s impatient (&rdquo;Ten year-olds mastered this quicker than you did.&rdquo;), his confidence in his methods inspires them.</p><p>On top of group exercises, he also teaches them one-on-one. They use the theatre basement as a practice space. On each side there are smaller, soundproof rooms designed for personal training. Alison both fears and enjoys these individual sessions. The low ceiling accentuates Roderick&rsquo;s height and his face shows no sign of humour. His critical ears dissect every sound that comes out of her mouth. Nothing escapes his sharp gaze. She feels so exposed, yet relishes his undivided attention. But in the end, even if he&rsquo;s impossible to please, it&rsquo;s the precision of his feedback that kicks her performance up a notch every week.</p><p>Despite these improvements and always putting her right front and centre, he still gives most of the solos to Clarissa, sometimes to other girls, never to her. The way he glances at her sometimes while Clarissa sings, makes her wonder if he does it on purpose, to spur her on. When frustration gets the better of her, she holds the note longer with unnecessary vibrato a la Christina Aguilera to outdo the others. Even if he gives her the stink eye&ndash; and so does the rest of the choir&ndash; it momentarily alleviates her irritation.</p><p>By October, Roderick has ejected one man from the group for coming to a practice hungover. Tension runs high. Everyone is a rival. Alison is wary of anyone who&rsquo;s being nice. She&rsquo;s not as suspicious of the men, as they&rsquo;re not her direct competition. Marcus, in particular, she gets along well.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re jealous of Clarissa,&rdquo; he remarks one day.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not fair,&rdquo; she replies like a petulant child. &ldquo;I think a choir should be an equal opportunities type of thing.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You sure that&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s about?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What else could it be?&rdquo;</p><p>Marcus hums &ldquo;Hot for teacher&rdquo;. Heat rises to Alison&rsquo;s cheeks, but she scoffs at the idea. That&rsquo;s crazy. She admires him, but that&rsquo;s a totally different thing. He&rsquo;s not unattractive, but he&rsquo;s not her type. And she&rsquo;s certainly not his, he&rsquo;s made that abundantly clear. Besides, he&rsquo;s a jerk, pitting them against each other that way to make them work harder for his own glory. It&rsquo;s working, but the choristers&rsquo; morale is at its lowest.</p><p>All this time spent on the choir, and the one-hour commute to the theatre, means less time with her friends and less shifts at the pub and therefore less money. Javier, at the Blue Bear, accommodates her, but he has a business to run. No matter how much he likes Alison, he has to give her shifts away to other waitresses.</p><p>By mid-October, Alison has dark circles under her eyes no makeup can cover. She often falls asleep on the bus and regularly fights with Elife over trivial things. The shorter hours of sunlight and gloomy weather isn&rsquo;t helping. She misses being alone on stage, the crowd&rsquo;s energy, their gazes on her, their applause, it filled a need that the choir doesn&rsquo;t. But Roderick announced they would give a concert at the beginning of December, which promises to finally give her the best of both world. That is, if he tolerates her presence in the choir that long.</p><p>Roderick fires another chorister, and she&rsquo;s convinced she&rsquo;s next. At night, thoughts of quitting keep her awake. But if she quits, she&rsquo;ll be back at square one, back to no musical career to speak of, having wasted two months of the last year she has to make it big. Of course, it&rsquo;s a bit silly to think her career opportunities will be over after 25, some people get a start much later in life. But she can&rsquo;t let herself think about that. If there&rsquo;s on thing she&rsquo;s learned from working with Roderick it&rsquo;s that she can&rsquo;t be indulgent with herself. If she gives herself an inch, she will take a mile.</p><p>If only she could get some sign that joining the choir was the right decision.</p><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s mail for you,&rdquo; Elife says.</p><p>&ldquo;Why are you making that face?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s from a solicitor.&rdquo;</p><p>Alison has to read the letter three times to make sense of all the legal terms. But after three times, the amount remains the same: 7000&pound;.</p><p>Elife reads over her shoulder. &ldquo;John? Isn&rsquo;t that your ex-husband? He&rsquo;s suing you for &lsquo;emotional distress&rsquo;. What the bloody hell?&rdquo;</p><p>A sudden coldness hits Alison&rsquo;s core. She stumbles to the living room and drops down on the couch.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have that kind of money&hellip; I&rsquo;ll have to quit the choir.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What? No. You&rsquo;re not paying him. You left three years ago and suddenly he&rsquo;s distressed? I bet he just wants to see you again, get your attention.&rdquo;</p><p>Alison hugs her knees.</p><p>The truth is she did treat John badly. She pretended to be in love with him to have a place to stay after she was kicked out of her flat. She wasn&rsquo;t supposed to be married to him for two years, but he adored her, and she couldn&rsquo;t resist that. He gave her a job and a house, and she was the star of the karaoke. Then she cheated with the first man who said he was in show business and left John without a word of explanation.</p><p>&ldquo;How old were you when you met him?&rdquo; Elife asks.</p><p>&ldquo;19.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How old was he?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;&hellip; 40. I always preferred older men.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He should have known better.&rdquo;</p><p>Alison doesn&rsquo;t argue. She avoids thinking about her relationship with John as it always prompts waves of guilt. But maybe he isn&rsquo;t so innocent in all of this.</p><p>There&rsquo;s a contact number at the bottom of the letter, she will call the solicitor this week as well as an old friend in Canterbury to figure out what prompted this accusation from John.</p><p>She feels like she has an iceberg inside her stomach, heavy and cold. She can imagine no positive outcome to this situation. She should quit the choir to work more hours. Anyway, Roderick has given no signs that he really wants her there. What&rsquo;s the point if it won&rsquo;t lead to career opportunities?</p><p>But the thing is, despite the fatigue and strained atmosphere, she loves the choir. When they sing together, all their voices blend in such a beautiful harmony, she forgets the rivalry and her need for attention, time slows and a feeling of being in sync with the world washes over her. Always, she walks out smiling and looking forward to the next rehearsal.</p><p>&#9834;</p><p>As co-owner of the Lux Aeterna theatre, Roderick has his own office on the second floor of the building. He&rsquo;s designed it himself: a warm shade of white on the walls and a simple glass desk. Minimalism helps him focus. He appreciates the music more when his other senses are not solicited. For much the same reason, he wears similar outfits everyday, he doesn&rsquo;t care to waste mental energy on such trivial decisions as clothing.</p><p>From his window overlooking the intersection, he spots Alison crossing the road to the coffeehouse. Now there&rsquo;s someone who is not a minimalist by any stretch of the imagination. She always has some colourful accessories on from dangling earrings to shimmering tights or, today, a scarf with a large floral print. She very much solicits his other senses. She&rsquo;s like a peacock, whereas he&rsquo;s more like the female of that species, and, well, he should stop thinking about her in aviary metaphors. </p><p>He&rsquo;s slipping on his coat to go out for coffee too when he stops himself. Already twice this week he met her there. What if someone saw them? He can&rsquo;t afford wagging tongues who would accuse him of partiality.</p><p>Alison has been on his list of &ldquo;spare choristers&rdquo; since the beginning. He chose her for her looks, but when competition comes, a great rack won&rsquo;t compensate for a poor voice. He hadn&rsquo;t count on her exceeding his expectations. She&rsquo;s improved steadily through the weeks and showed a dedication to their work (if not to the choir itself as demonstrated by her attempts at standing out from the group). She deserves to sing solo parts, but he can&rsquo;t risk antagonizing Clarissa. </p><p>Choirs across Britain seek Clarissa as a member, and Roderick won her by cashing in a favour. Five years ago, she suffered from an Adderall addiction caused by the high amount of pressure put on students of the Music Academy. A breakdown during exams jeopardized her acceptance in the Master&rsquo;s program, but Roderick convinced the deanship to give her a chance. She owes him, but for how long? He needs her to win the national competition and restore his reputation.</p><p>Glancing at his watch, he reconsiders his decision to forgo coffee and Alison, but Vera decides for him. The theatre manager comes into his office, wearing that leather jacket she keeps for important meetings. </p><p>&ldquo;How did it go?&rdquo; Roderick asks.</p><p>&ldquo;They are interested in investing in the choir. But before committing they asked to watch today&rsquo;s session.&rdquo;</p><p>Roderick rubs the back of his neck. A year ago, his name as choir director would have been enough for their patronage, now they need extra reassurance.</p><p>&ldquo;What do I tell them?&rdquo; Vera asks.</p><p>&ldquo;Of course they can. Make them feel as welcome as possible. By the way, how are the ticket sales for the December concert?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re selling.&rdquo;</p><p>He invites her to elaborate with a hand movement.</p><p>&ldquo;Not as fast as we&rsquo;d hoped, but&hellip; steadily. Maybe it&rsquo;s because of that letter to the editor.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What letter?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;In the last issue of The Gramophone. It&rsquo;s nothing, forget it,&rdquo; Vera says, but Roderick is already at his computer, doing research. &ldquo;We need more staff for the bar and the ticket booth. I&rsquo;ll email you the ad I wrote.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Mmhmm,&rdquo; he says without taking his eyes off the screen. </p><p>The letter in question calls for stricter rules in music competitions &ldquo;to avoid such debacles as last year&rsquo;s &lsquo;A Song for Christmas&rsquo;,&rdquo; it says. Although his name isn&rsquo;t mentioned as such, it&rsquo;s clearly about him and his &ldquo;shameful behaviour&rdquo;. </p><p>Roderick removes his glasses and rubs a hand down his face. Today&rsquo;s choir practice has better be perfect.</p><p>In the mirror behind his office door, he smooths his hair and arranges the collar of his sweater, he likes it snug around his neck.</p><p>&ldquo;Inhale success&hellip; Exhale doubt.&rdquo;</p><p>In the lobby of the theatre, Alison is already fulfilling her duty without being aware of it: she&rsquo;s chatting with the potential investors. Hands in the back pockets of her tight jeans, she&rsquo;s pitching her voice higher than natural in a way that makes her sound younger. By all accounts, she&rsquo;s flirting, but her laughter sounds strained to him.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, Mr Peterson.&rdquo; She waves at him. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t see you for coffee as usual today.&rdquo;</p><p>He frowns at her choice of words. Other choristers in the lobby glance between them. He crosses his hands behind his back.</p><p>&ldquo;I would hardly call a handful of coincidences &lsquo;usual&rsquo;, miss Crosby.&rdquo;</p><p>She flinches at his cold tone, and a hint of guilt surprises him. </p><p>&ldquo;Right, of course not,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;I just meant that it happens sometimes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Off you go, we&rsquo;re about to start.&rdquo;</p><p>With his pupils, Roderick runs through the familiar warm-ups. He can&rsquo;t see the two investors, they&rsquo;re somewhere on a dark balcony, yet he feels their gazes like burning coals on the back of his skull.</p><p>He rubs his moist palms on his trousers before picking up his baton and tapping it lightly against the lectern. They begin with Mendelssohn&rsquo;s &ldquo;Magnificat&rdquo; in which Clarissa sings a solo. She&rsquo;s the perfect chorister, disciplined and consistent. He focuses on her and makes a point not to look at Alison. But he hears her, always a little louder than the others, and out of the corner of his eye, he catches her stepping out.</p><p><i>Not now</i>.</p><p>He can tell by the annotations his students quickly strike or scribble on their partitions that his directions are inconsistent.</p><p>Marcus&rsquo;s voice squeaks. Abel rocks on his feet. Janet is off by half an octave. Every mistake rings in his ears like nails on a blackboard. They&rsquo;ve practiced this piece before, multiple times, why are they failing him now?</p><p>His jaw clenches. His neck strains. He jerks the baton without finesse.</p><p>The song ends, and he takes a measured breath. The choristers are silent, aware something is going on.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you seek to humiliate me?&rdquo; he shouts.</p><p>A collective gasp echoes in the empty theatre.</p><p>&ldquo;From the top. Do better.&rdquo;</p><p>The second time isn&rsquo;t as bad, but control slips out of his grasp like the baton from his clammy hand.</p><p>&ldquo;Clarissa, wasn&rsquo;t that a little high for you?&rdquo; Alison says at the end.</p><p>&ldquo;Miss Crosby,&rdquo; he snaps. &ldquo;Backstage. Now!&rdquo;</p><p>They stride off the stage, out of earshot, into the dressing-room.</p><p>She hangs her head sheepishly, but he doesn&rsquo;t miss the smile she fights to suppress.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you enjoying acting like a brat? I&rsquo;ve taught children who were more mature than you. Why are you doing this to me? Today of all days. Do you wish to sabotage my work? You are not worthy of my choir.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then fire me and get it over with, you&rsquo;ve been wanting to do so since day one. You obviously don&rsquo;t care about me&ndash;&rdquo; He holds up a closed fist, the signal he uses to end a song. &ldquo;Did you just conduct me to shut up?&rdquo;</p><p>Hands on hips, she steps up to him. He looks down her nose at her.</p><p>&ldquo;The more you try to make it all about you, the less it will be,&rdquo; he threatens.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not trying to do that.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, you are! There is no &lsquo;I&rsquo; in choir, miss Crosby.&rdquo; </p><p>She has just enough survival instincts to hold back a laughter. He deflates slightly.</p><p>&ldquo;Choral, I meant, no &lsquo;I&rsquo; in choral. My point is there is no room for your ego in this ensemble.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Mr Peterson.&rdquo; She wrings her hands and sniffs. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve received some bad news yesterday.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t use that voice with me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m upset, is all. I feel like&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not your psychoanalyst.&rdquo;</p><p>She groans and paces the floor. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand what you want from me. Why did you choose me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Because you&rsquo;re sexy.&rdquo; His tone is nothing but snide. &ldquo;I think I can use you to sway the male judges. You were certainly willing enough to wield your sexuality over me.&rdquo;</p><p>Her jaw drops, and she shakes her head. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re just like the others,&rdquo; she murmurs.</p><p>He backpedals, &ldquo;And for your voice, of course. And stage presence.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re using me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;As you are using me,&rdquo; he counters.</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why did you want to join my choir?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Roderick, c&rsquo;mon. Because I like it.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;When we met, you said you were a singer. Are you using the choir to advance your own career?&rdquo;</p><p>She avoids his gaze and bites the inside of her cheeks. She huffs a breath and jabs a finger on his chest.</p><p>&ldquo;You know what? You&rsquo;re one to talk.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;What is that supposed to mean?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I mean that you&rsquo;re the one making this choir all about you. <i>Your </i>success, not ours. It&rsquo;s all about <i>your </i>ego.&rdquo; This time when she pokes him, he grabs her hand.</p><p>&ldquo;I am the conductor, the most important person here. And they understand this.&rdquo; He points towards the stage.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, your minions.&rdquo; Alison scoffs in his face.</p><p>&ldquo;You must respect my authority.&rdquo;</p><p>Their noses are inches apart now. Alison&rsquo;s cheeks burn, she breathes shallowly.</p><p>&ldquo;What is this, bloody South Korea?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I think you&rsquo;ll find you meant North Korea.&rdquo;</p><p>She jerks her arm out of his grasp. &ldquo;Whatever, mate.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Mate?&rdquo;</p><p>She sits on the corner of a table, her back hunched. She stares at her hands with vacant eyes. </p><p>He removes his glasses and pinches the bridge of his nose. After a moment of hesitation, he sits down next to her. He should go back to the auditorium, and go on with the rehearsal, but he stays backstage, with Alison. </p><p>&ldquo;What did you mean &lsquo;today of all days&rsquo;? When we came in, you said that.&rdquo; Her voice is faint, she&rsquo;s still not looking at him.</p><p>&ldquo;There were potential investors watching us.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Investors?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I was hoping to get a sponsorship deal for the choir. I know the rehearsals are time-consuming and you all have other monetary obligations.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Wow, I really fucked up.&rdquo; She laughs bitterly. </p><p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That why you were so stressed out?&rdquo;</p><p>Had it been so obvious? </p><p>She searches his face, and he fights the urge to put his glasses back on.</p><p>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t mind me asking, what is the bad news you received?&rdquo; he asks.</p><p>&ldquo;Em, well, ironically enough it&rsquo;s about money&mdash; don&rsquo;t correct me if that&rsquo;s not what irony is.&rdquo; Roderick closes his mouth. &ldquo;Someone is suing me for a lot of money. I work at a pub, so I&rsquo;m not exactly rich and the choir is really cutting into my working hours. I don&rsquo;t want to quit, I love it, but I don&rsquo;t know what to do.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ask Vera, my associate, we&rsquo;re looking for extra staff here at the theatre.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If you think that would help.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Maybe, if I could work right after or before rehearsals, then I wouldn&rsquo;t lose all that time on the bus,&rdquo; she muses out loud. She rubs her thumb in her palm, then looks up at him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry I said you don&rsquo;t care about us.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Apology accepted. And, well, I&rsquo;m sorry I called you a brat.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I am, though.&rdquo;</p><p>They chuckle, and suddenly Alison&rsquo;s arms are around him. He freezes. He&rsquo;s not the kind of person people usually want to hug. A slow smile spreads over his lips, and he pats her back.</p><hr /><p><a href=\"http://lostinfic.tumblr.com/post/181783142399/dissonance-and-harmony-5\">Part 5</a></p></p>",
