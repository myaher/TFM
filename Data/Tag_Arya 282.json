People clapped for their prince, sure that he would win, Gendry wasn&rsquo;t as sure, that arrow on the second ring could be his undoing.</p><p>It was. Arya took her time with the bow, but each arrow it dead center, spitting the previous arrows in a half with the second and third turn.</p><p>&ldquo;My prince,&rdquo; she said with the bow, lifting her now muddy dress like she had been thought.</p><p>&ldquo;My lady, you&rsquo;re a worthy adversary.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You too, my Prince.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The crown, please?&rdquo; she asked and he put it on her hands once again.</p><p>&ldquo;It still counts as winning the bet, correct?&rdquo; he whispered and she shrugged her shoulders with a smile, before adding to the public, &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the crown. Who will recieve this honor?&rdquo;his <br /></p><p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I name the most beautiful lady in this tourney, Queen of Love and Beauty,&rdquo; she said walking to where Gendry had walked to previously. &ldquo;Mother, if you would accept the honor?&rdquo; Arya asked.</p><p>Catelyn, who had been exasperated by her daughter&rsquo;s behavior, couldn&rsquo;t help but smile at her daughter&rsquo;s gesture; Ned helped her stand and walk her down the stalls.</p><p>&ldquo;Can I?&rdquo; her father asked when they reached Arya and she couldn&rsquo;t reach her mother&rsquo;s head, Ned took the crown of flowers, that brought him memories he didn&rsquo;t want to remember, and placed them on his wife&rsquo;s head as his daughter announced.</p><p>&ldquo;I crown Lady Catelyn Stark Queen of Love and Beauty for all to see.&rdquo; Claps were heard through the tourney, none louder than Sansa&rsquo;s, that was able to forgive her sister&rsquo;s careless and immature actions for the honor she gave their mother.</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you, sweetling,&rdquo; Catelyn thanked Arya as she came to take her seat once again, squeezing her fingers. &ldquo;But you shouldn&rsquo;t question the prince.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Gendry doesn&rsquo;t mind and you deserve the crown more than I.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t. You&rsquo;re more beautiful than I could ever be,&rdquo; Catelyn said with a smile and kiss on Arya&rsquo;s forehead, &ldquo;both my daughters are,&rdquo; she added, squeezing Sansa&rsquo;s hand as well. And Arya smiled at her mother&rsquo;s words, not convinced that she was more beautiful than her mother, no one was, but believing that maybe she could be beautiful too, she could accept it as long as she could fight as well.<br /></p>",

Arya maintains that her bad behavior was an excuse, nothing more, pointing out that the only septa they\u2019ve ever managed to keep is a spy for the Faith. Opinions are torn on who\u2019s actually right.</p><p>This Arya grew up knowing that a war was on its way, a war that wouldn\u2019t care about sex or age or station. She also grew up near several female warriors: the free folk spearwives who sometimes come to the castle, her mother\u2019s Mormont ladies-in-waiting, assorted crannogwomen, singers of the song of earth, the visiting women of the hill tribes, and her own ghostly kin. Like her brothers Robb and Bran, Arya can see the ghosts of Winterfell, and the Stark women of old told her to tell her parents that they\u2019d train her in swordsmanship if she didn\u2019t get a living tutor.</p><p>Ned and Cat very wisely chose to get her living tutors: the wood dancers of the singers of the song of earth. They knew from an early age that Arya would grow up small and slim and strong, so they reasoned that the singers\u2019 fighting style would suit her more than, say, Mormont ax-fighting.</p><p>They were absolutely right. Arya took to the wood dancers\u2019 knives, spears, and arrows like a fish to water&ndash;but she wanted to learn the sword as well, so Ned sent to Braavos for a water dancer, correctly believing that the Braavosi style would suit her. Syrio Forel is a bit eccentric, but he gets along well with his pupil and has even been known to teach others (mostly singers and crannogfolk) his techniques. Arya has managed to create a blended style all her own, and she is very, very good at it.</p><p>This Arya gets along much better with Sansa and Catelyn. She doesn\u2019t feel any need to live up to her sister\u2019s accomplishments in the ladylike arts, and her mother doesn\u2019t try to force her into it. The lack of a consistent, non-spy septa helps with this, too. Additionally, Arya has ways of bonding with her female relatives that didn\u2019t exist in canon. She helps Sansa with her research by talking with the ghosts of Winterfell, whom Sansa can\u2019t see. (This has made Arya very fluent in the Old Tongue, and Syrio\u2019s taught her quite a bit of Braavosi.) She\u2019s also fascinated with her mother\u2019s spy network and is learning quite a bit about espionage at her mother\u2019s knee. She even gets lessons from Bloodraven sometimes. It would surprise absolutely no one if Arya were to succeed Cat as Winterfell\u2019s unofficial Mistress of Whispers.</p><p>Jon Snow is still her favorite sibling and best friend, though. She taught him the harp, he wrote her a song. He helped teach her swordplay&ndash;namely how to fight against traditionally trained Westerosi&ndash;and she promised that next time she finds a magic sword, she\u2019ll give it to him. (Considering that she\u2019s already found one magic sword in the godswood pool, this is more likely than you\u2019d think.) Since Stark children are told about Jon\u2019s heritage at age twelve, she doesn\u2019t know yet that he\u2019s technically her cousin&ndash;or at least she\u2019s not supposed to. She actually figured it out a couple years ago but decided that Jon will tell her when he\u2019s ready, and it\u2019s not like this makes him any less her brother.</p><p>(That being said, it\u2019s a very good thing so few people can see ghosts. If they could, they\u2019d probably pay attention when Rhaegar Targaryen comes to visit&hellip; and they might notice that he and Jon Snow have the same laugh.)</p><p>Arya is a skilled warg, able to slip into both her direwolf Nymeria and one of the castle cats. She\u2019s also displayed an affinity for the singers\u2019 brand of illusion magic, though due to her young age and the lack of dragons and the magic they bring into the world she hasn\u2019t been trained much in this. After hearing Syrio\u2019s tales of the Faceless Men, she tried to get her parents to bring one to the Academy, but they put their foot down.\u00a0</p><p>(On a completely unrelated note, Syrio Forel may or may not have sent off a letter to an old friend of his who may or may not be on the way to Winterfell.)</p><p>When winter comes, Arya probably won\u2019t be on the front lines of battle. Her style of fighting isn\u2019t particularly suited for that. But she <i>will</i> be somewhere in the fray, fighting to keep her pack safe.</p>",

Arya maintains that her bad behavior was an excuse, nothing more, pointing out that the only septa they\u2019ve ever managed to keep is a spy for the Faith. Opinions are torn on who\u2019s actually right.</p><p>This Arya grew up knowing that a war was on its way, a war that wouldn\u2019t care about sex or age or station. She also grew up near several female warriors: the free folk spearwives who sometimes come to the castle, her mother\u2019s Mormont ladies-in-waiting, assorted crannogwomen, singers of the song of earth, the visiting women of the hill tribes, and her own ghostly kin. Like her brothers Robb and Bran, Arya can see the ghosts of Winterfell, and the Stark women of old told her to tell her parents that they\u2019d train her in swordsmanship if she didn\u2019t get a living tutor.</p><p>Ned and Cat very wisely chose to get her living tutors: the wood dancers of the singers of the song of earth. They knew from an early age that Arya would grow up small and slim and strong, so they reasoned that the singers\u2019 fighting style would suit her more than, say, Mormont ax-fighting.</p><p>They were absolutely right. Arya took to the wood dancers\u2019 knives, spears, and arrows like a fish to water\u2013but she wanted to learn the sword as well, so Ned sent to Braavos for a water dancer, correctly believing that the Braavosi style would suit her. Syrio Forel is a bit eccentric, but he gets along well with his pupil and has even been known to teach others (mostly singers and crannogfolk) his techniques. Arya has managed to create a blended style all her own, and she is very, very good at it.</p><p>This Arya gets along much better with Sansa and Catelyn. She doesn\u2019t feel any need to live up to her sister\u2019s accomplishments in the ladylike arts, and her mother doesn\u2019t try to force her into it. The lack of a consistent, non-spy septa helps with this, too. Additionally, Arya has ways of bonding with her female relatives that didn\u2019t exist in canon. She helps Sansa with her research by talking with the ghosts of Winterfell, whom Sansa can\u2019t see. (This has made Arya very fluent in the Old Tongue, and Syrio\u2019s taught her quite a bit of Braavosi.) She\u2019s also fascinated with her mother\u2019s spy network and is learning quite a bit about espionage at her mother\u2019s knee. She even gets lessons from Bloodraven sometimes. It would surprise absolutely no one if Arya were to succeed Cat as Winterfell\u2019s unofficial Mistress of Whispers.</p><p>Jon Snow is still her favorite sibling and best friend, though. She taught him the harp, he wrote her a song. He helped teach her swordplay\u2013namely how to fight against traditionally trained Westerosi\u2013and she promised that next time she finds a magic sword, she\u2019ll give it to him. (Considering that she\u2019s already found one magic sword in the godswood pool, this is more likely than you\u2019d think.) Since Stark children are told about Jon\u2019s heritage at age twelve, she doesn\u2019t know yet that he\u2019s technically her cousin\u2013or at least she\u2019s not supposed to. She actually figured it out a couple years ago but decided that Jon will tell her when he\u2019s ready, and it\u2019s not like this makes him any less her brother.</p><p>(That being said, it\u2019s a very good thing so few people can see ghosts. If they could, they\u2019d probably pay attention when Rhaegar Targaryen comes to visit\u2026 and they might notice that he and Jon Snow have the same laugh.)</p><p>Arya is a skilled warg, able to slip into both her direwolf Nymeria and one of the castle cats. She\u2019s also displayed an affinity for the singers\u2019 brand of illusion magic, though due to her young age and the lack of dragons and the magic they bring into the world she hasn\u2019t been trained much in this. After hearing Syrio\u2019s tales of the Faceless Men, she tried to get her parents to bring one to the Academy, but they put their foot down.\u00a0</p><p>(On a completely unrelated note, Syrio Forel may or may not have sent off a letter to an old friend of his who may or may not be on the way to Winterfell.)</p><p>When winter comes, Arya probably won\u2019t be on the front lines of battle.

        "body": "<p>You know how some people have been saying that Sansa is not a Stark and most definitely not true to her father\u2019s teachings, because she was the one to sentence Littlefinger to death, yet she did not\u00a0\u201cswing the sword\u201d.</p><p>It\u2019s been bugging me since\u00a0 f o r e v e r.</p><p><b>a.</b> The whole point of this scene was to show how Littlefinger did not succeed in breaking the pack apart. What we see is Sansa serving as the judge, Arya as the executioner, and Bran providing all the\u00a0\u201cevidence\u201d. <b>The lone wolf dies, the pack survives.</b> It\u2019s not just Sansa who makes it happen, it\u2019s all three of them. I mean Sansa is obviously the leader, serving both as the Lady of Winterfell and the de facto acting Queen in the North (in Jon\u2019s absence), but we aren\u2019t witnessing her personal vendetta but rather a presentation of an extended list of Littlefinger\u2019s crimes against the Starks, the North and the Vale.</p><p><b>b.</b> I think we are relying too much on the exact wording of the sentence:\u00a0<i>\u201cThe man who passes the sentence should swing the sword\u201d</i> and ignoring the rest of Ned\u2019s lesson. It is mentioned both in Jon\u2019s and Arya\u2019s POVs in\u00a0<i>\u201cThe Clash of Kings\u201d</i>:</p><p><br/></p><blockquote><p><i>\n\nBut she didn\u2019t think she should trust Jaqen. I should kill them myself. Whenever her father had condemned a man to death, he did the deed himself with Ice, his greatsword. <b>\u201cIf you would take a man\u2019s life, you owe it to him to look him in the face and hear his last words,\u201d</b> she\u2019d heard him tell Robb and Jon once.</i><br/></p><p>Arya VII,\u00a0<i>\u201cThe Clash of Kings\u201d</i></p></blockquote><p><br/></p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cMy father never used a headsman. <b>He said he owed it to men he killed to look into their eyes and hear their last words.</b>\u201d</i></p><p>Jon VII,\u00a0<i>\u201cThe Clash of Kings\u201d</i></p></blockquote><p><br/></p><p>Isn\u2019t that what Sansa did?
