Part two.</h1><p><a href=\"http://harrys-kiwi.tumblr.com/post/181655700110/this-isnt-a-dream\" target=\"_blank\">\u00a0<i>Part 1</i></a></p><p>\u201cMr. Styles, I\u2019m going to need you to explain to Dr. Worthington what you just told me.\u201d</p><p>Harry\u2019s hands hadn\u2019t stopped shaking from the moment he broke down the bathroom door to discover his girlfriend lying on the floor in a small puddle of blood with a large cut on her arm. A million thoughts raced through his mind, and he still hadn\u2019t been able to make sense of what happened.</p><p>\u201cShe went to the bathroom. I heard glass breaking and I thought I heard her scream so I went to check on her. She wouldn\u2019t open the door so I broke it down and that\u2019s where I found her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was unconscious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, Mr. Styles, do you have reason to believe that this wound was self-inflicted?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Harry scowled. Why would she do something like that? Harry wrote it off completely. He didn\u2019t understand: everything had been so good, why would this happen? Was it an accident? Why wouldn\u2019t (Y/N) let him into the bathroom?</p><p>He watched as Dr. Worthington took down a few notes on his pad and then looked up at Harry again.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to wait till Ms. (Y/L/N) wakes up so she can explain the situation. We might have to consider getting into touch with the Psychiatric ward.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d Harry scoffed. <i>Psychiatric ward? </i>Over what he was sure was just an accident? And yet, Harry couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that maybe she had done this to herself after all. He couldn\u2019t piece the picture together, though. (Y/N) didn\u2019t have a past with self-harm or mental illness. Nothing serious had happened in the past months. Hell, last night Harry held her as they binged \u201cYou\u201d and came up with theories about Joe together. It wouldn\u2019t make any sense.</p><p>Every hour that passed with (Y/N) still unconscious, Harry grew more and more antsy. He had too much time to think and he didn\u2019t like it. What if he had overlooked something? Maybe she wasn\u2019t as happy as he thought she was. He was resting his head in his hands and his elbows on his knees - which were currently shaking with nerves. But they stilled when he saw (Y/N)\u2019s hand begin to move.</p><p>(Y/N) could feel herself regain consciousness, and grew more and more confident that she had done it; she had successfully restored herself to her normal life again. So it was a very realistic dream, alright. She had learned her lesson: no more attempts at self-hypnosis for lucid dreaming. She noticed how heavy her arm felt, and she flinched at the bright light that met her eyes as she opened them. She sudden movement caused a shooting pain up her arm, and she cried out. She took a look at her surroundings, and felt tears well up in her eyes upon noticing that she was once again in unfamiliar surroundings. </p><p>\u201c(Y/N)! Baby, you\u2019re awake, thank god,\u201d Harry reached to pull his girlfriend close to him, desperate to make sure she was okay. He needed to hear her say that it was an accident, that it was all fine, and that she wanted him to take her home now. Instead, she pushed him away as she tried to contain her sobs. </p><p>\u201cWhy are you pushing me away, love?\u201d Harry whispered, feeling tears well up in his eyes also, overwhelmed by the events of the day, and now this?</p><p>\u201cWhy do you keep calling me that?\u201d (Y/N) cried out, hiding her face in her hands as she sobbed. It hadn\u2019t worked. She was still here. She felt her heart ache in her chest - what was happening?</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Harry pleaded with her.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know me! This is so weird, don\u2019t you see how weird this is?\u201d She sputtered, as she felt her chest getting heavy again. Her breathing was irregular and Harry grew evermore worried for her. He got up to call the doctor, trying to ignore what she had just told him. He wanted to cry out to her, to have her explain what she meant but he didn\u2019t want to upset her even more. </p><p>Dr. Worthington rushed into the room, two nurses hot on his trail. \u201cMs. (Y/L/N), everything is going to be okay. You\u2019re in a safe place, everything is fine now.\u201d</p><p>She could only imagine what she looked like right now. She tried to calm herself down, realizing that she wasn\u2019t helping her credibility. She knew that no one would believe her story, that she just woke up in a different life, but she felt that freaking out like this would only confirm the doctors\u2019 thinking that she was insane. When her breathing had evened out, she spared a glance at Harry. He was standing at the side of the hospital room, eyes bloodshot and a lone tear at the bottom of his chin. </p><p>\u201cMs. (Y/L/N), do you remember what happened? Do you think you can tell us how you got here?\u201d</p><p>Of course (Y/N) remembered. But how does she even begin explaining? <i>Oh yeah Doctor, I woke up in a random house that ended up being Harry Styles\u2019 and I stabbed myself so I could wake myself up cause the only logical explanation was that it was a dream. </i>As if anyone would buy that. She tried to think of ways to phrase her story so that it would make sense.</p><p><i>Should I just lie? Tell them that it was an accident, that everything\u2019s okay and then go home with Harry and try to figure this out? What good will it bring me to tell them the truth, they won\u2019t believe me anyway. I\u2019ll drive myself insane.</i></p><p>\u201cI cut myself on some glass, sir. I didn\u2019t think it was that bad. I heard the door knock but I was too dizzy to get up and open it. As I was getting up to try and do so, I must have fainted.\u201d (Y/N) opted for a half-truth. </p><p>Dr. Worthington took down some things on his clipboard once again. Then he looked up at (Y/N) and smiled, thanked her for her cooperation, and told her she would be just fine. He gave Harry the okay to take her home, gave some instructions for caring for the wound, gave them an appointment to get the stitches removed, and sent them on their way. After (Y/N) had gotten dressed and made her way outside the room, Dr. Worthington handed her a Psychologist\u2019s contact card, nodded, and left. She tucked it into her bag and made her way to where Harry was waiting. </p><p>They walked side by side in silence. What were they supposed to say to each other? Maybe freaking out at him like that wasn\u2019t the right thing to do, but she was in a hell of a position right now. They got into the car, and Harry took a deep breath before grabbing the steering wheel and clenching his jaw. </p><p>\u201c(Y/N). I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair that this is how you treat me after scaring me like this.\u201d He noticed himself getting choked up so he stopped talking, looking down instead.</p><p>(Y/N) took his hands into hers, and she felt a wave of calmness wash over her for the first time since she woke up that morning. She stroked his hands with her thumbs, noticing how soft they were. <i>This isn\u2019t his fault. It isn\u2019t easy on him either, poor thing.</i></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Harry. I\u2019ll try to explain when we get home.\u201d She reached one hand up to his face, wiping away a tear and then cupping his cheek, stroking it with her thumb. Harry lifted the hand that was clasped in hers, gave it a soft kiss, and then started the car to get the two of them home.</p><p>A/N: Thank you guys so much for your positive feedback and support for this story! Seeing your positive reactions to this story, which I am so passionate about, is amazing. Love you all, and as always, let me know if you would like a continuation.</p>",

Instead, she pushed him away as she tried to contain her sobs. </p><p>\u201cWhy are you pushing me away, love?\u201d Harry whispered, feeling tears well up in his eyes also, overwhelmed by the events of the day, and now this?</p><p>\u201cWhy do you keep calling me that?\u201d (Y/N) cried out, hiding her face in her hands as she sobbed. It hadn\u2019t worked. She was still here. She felt her heart ache in her chest - what was happening?</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Harry pleaded with her.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know me! This is so weird, don\u2019t you see how weird this is?\u201d She sputtered, as she felt her chest getting heavy again. Her breathing was irregular and Harry grew evermore worried for her. He got up to call the doctor, trying to ignore what she had just told him. He wanted to cry out to her, to have her explain what she meant but he didn\u2019t want to upset her even more. </p><p>Dr. Worthington rushed into the room, two nurses hot on his trail. \u201cMs. (Y/L/N), everything is going to be okay. You\u2019re in a safe place, everything is fine now.\u201d</p><p>She could only imagine what she looked like right now. She tried to calm herself down, realizing that she wasn\u2019t helping her credibility. She knew that no one would believe her story, that she just woke up in a different life, but she felt that freaking out like this would only confirm the doctors\u2019 thinking that she was insane. When her breathing had evened out, she spared a glance at Harry. He was standing at the side of the hospital room, eyes bloodshot and a lone tear at the bottom of his chin. </p><p>\u201cMs. (Y/L/N), do you remember what happened? Do you think you can tell us how you got here?\u201d</p><p>Of course (Y/N) remembered. But how does she even begin explaining? <i>Oh yeah Doctor, I woke up in a random house that ended up being Harry Styles\u2019 and I stabbed myself so I could wake myself up cause the only logical explanation was that it was a dream. </i>As if anyone would buy that. She tried to think of ways to phrase her story so that it would make sense.</p><p><i>Should I just lie? Tell them that it was an accident, that everything\u2019s okay and then go home with Harry and try to figure this out? What good will it bring me to tell them the truth, they won\u2019t believe me anyway. I\u2019ll drive myself insane.</i></p><p>\u201cI cut myself on some glass, sir. I didn\u2019t think it was that bad. I heard the door knock but I was too dizzy to get up and open it. As I was getting up to try and do so, I must have fainted.\u201d (Y/N) opted for a half-truth. </p><p>Dr. Worthington took down some things on his clipboard once again. Then he looked up at (Y/N) and smiled, thanked her for her cooperation, and told her she would be just fine. He gave Harry the okay to take her home, gave some instructions for caring for the wound, gave them an appointment to get the stitches removed, and sent them on their way. After (Y/N) had gotten dressed and made her way outside the room, Dr. Worthington handed her a Psychologist\u2019s contact card, nodded, and left. She tucked it into her bag and made her way to where Harry was waiting. </p><p>They walked side by side in silence. What were they supposed to say to each other? Maybe freaking out at him like that wasn\u2019t the right thing to do, but she was in a hell of a position right now. They got into the car, and Harry took a deep breath before grabbing the steering wheel and clenching his jaw. </p><p>\u201c(Y/N). I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair that this is how you treat me after scaring me like this.\u201d He noticed himself getting choked up so he stopped talking, looking down instead.</p><p>(Y/N) took his hands into hers, and she felt a wave of calmness wash over her for the first time since she woke up that morning. She stroked his hands with her thumbs, noticing how soft they were. <i>This isn\u2019t his fault. It isn\u2019t easy on him either, poor thing.</i></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Harry. I\u2019ll try to explain when we get home.\u201d She reached one hand up to his face, wiping away a tear and then cupping his cheek, stroking it with her thumb. Harry lifted the hand that was clasped in hers, gave it a soft kiss, and then started the car to get the two of them home.</p><p>A/N: Thank you guys so much for your positive feedback and support for this story!

Part two.</h1><p><a href=\"http://harrys-kiwi.tumblr.com/post/181655700110/this-isnt-a-dream\" target=\"_blank\">&nbsp;<i>Part 1</i></a></p><p>&ldquo;Mr. Styles, I&rsquo;m going to need you to explain to Dr. Worthington what you just told me.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry&rsquo;s hands hadn&rsquo;t stopped shaking from the moment he broke down the bathroom door to discover his girlfriend lying on the floor in a small puddle of blood with a large cut on her arm. A million thoughts raced through his mind, and he still hadn&rsquo;t been able to make sense of what happened.</p><p>&ldquo;She went to the bathroom. I heard glass breaking and I thought I heard her scream so I went to check on her. She wouldn&rsquo;t open the door so I broke it down and that&rsquo;s where I found her.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She was unconscious?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Now, Mr. Styles, do you have reason to believe that this wound was self-inflicted?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; Harry scowled. Why would she do something like that? Harry wrote it off completely. He didn&rsquo;t understand: everything had been so good, why would this happen? Was it an accident? Why wouldn&rsquo;t (Y/N) let him into the bathroom?</p><p>He watched as Dr. Worthington took down a few notes on his pad and then looked up at Harry again.</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to wait till Ms. (Y/L/N) wakes up so she can explain the situation. We might have to consider getting into touch with the Psychiatric ward.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Excuse me?&rdquo; Harry scoffed. <i>Psychiatric ward? </i>Over what he was sure was just an accident? And yet, Harry couldn&rsquo;t shake the feeling that maybe she had done this to herself after all. He couldn&rsquo;t piece the picture together, though. (Y/N) didn&rsquo;t have a past with self-harm or mental illness. Nothing serious had happened in the past months. Hell, last night Harry held her as they binged &ldquo;You&rdquo; and came up with theories about Joe together. It wouldn&rsquo;t make any sense.</p><p>Every hour that passed with (Y/N) still unconscious, Harry grew more and more antsy. He had too much time to think and he didn&rsquo;t like it. What if he had overlooked something? Maybe she wasn&rsquo;t as happy as he thought she was. He was resting his head in his hands and his elbows on his knees - which were currently shaking with nerves. But they stilled when he saw (Y/N)&rsquo;s hand begin to move.</p><p>(Y/N) could feel herself regain consciousness, and grew more and more confident that she had done it; she had successfully restored herself to her normal life again. So it was a very realistic dream, alright. She had learned her lesson: no more attempts at self-hypnosis for lucid dreaming. She noticed how heavy her arm felt, and she flinched at the bright light that met her eyes as she opened them. She sudden movement caused a shooting pain up her arm, and she cried out. She took a look at her surroundings, and felt tears well up in her eyes upon noticing that she was once again in unfamiliar surroundings. </p><p>&ldquo;(Y/N)! Baby, you&rsquo;re awake, thank god,&rdquo; Harry reached to pull his girlfriend close to him, desperate to make sure she was okay. He needed to hear her say that it was an accident, that it was all fine, and that she wanted him to take her home now. Instead, she pushed him away as she tried to contain her sobs. </p><p>&ldquo;Why are you pushing me away, love?&rdquo; Harry whispered, feeling tears well up in his eyes also, overwhelmed by the events of the day, and now this?</p><p>&ldquo;Why do you keep calling me that?&rdquo; (Y/N) cried out, hiding her face in her hands as she sobbed.

Too quiet. It felt normal, but it shouldn\u2019t have been. Things were off with Harry, but both of you tried to stay calm and had no fights even when you wanted to question him about something or when he found out about the project with Harry Lambert, but not from you. On the 17th you travelled back to the USA, to Boston. On the plane you were sitting next to Harry for ten minutes, but when you didn\u2019t start a conversation he excused himself and left. He didn\u2019t say where but you guessed he went back to the band or Kacey. You talked with Jeff all the way to Boston. </p><p>It felt like it was just a habit being next to him. When you went trough paparazzi on the airport you didn\u2019t feel the thrill when he got \u00a0hold on your hand in front of everyone, because he didn\u2019t, not this time. You traveled by the same car to the hotel where you occupied your separate rooms. You sat on your bed, thinking. A few hours passed and you were into a book when someone knocked. You stood up to open the door. You were a bit surprised when you opened. </p><p>\u201cHey\u201d Harry said.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d you stepped back and let him in. </p><p>\u201cI missed you\u201d he said as he wrapped his arms around you from behind. </p><p>\u201cI missed you too.

You didn\u2019t tell about your project with Harry either.\u201d you both sat down on the bed. </p><p>\u201cI know, I\u2019m sorry. And I let you do whatever you want. You tell me when it\u2019s time\u201d you smiled, he smiled back. </p><p>\u201cThanks\u201d </p><p>\u201cWanna \u00a0watch something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u201d he said and you gave him a questioning look. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to do anything. Can we just be here and not do anything?\u201d he asked. </p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d He stayed late and eventually you watched a movie, but he was back in his room for the evening. You called Lottie after he left. </p><p>\u201cOkay, do you need me to come to kick his arse? You know that it\u2019s me who is allowed to do that officially.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know\u201d you chuckled. \u201cThanks, but we need to solve it ourselves. But please let\u2019s talk about something else. How\u2019s the baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s as big as a strawberry now and has little arms and legs. I\u2019ve gained a few pounds so I needed some stretchy pants. I saw that some veins are more visible and asked my doctor about it, but she said it\u2019s because they\u2019re carrying the extra blood for the baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all so interesting. I love how you changed. You watch yourself a lot more now.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI do.

And Harry\u2019s outfit was hot. You all gathered for photos and then the concert started. Harry was funny and even let two girls on stage to dance with him. It was a big party. As the concert finished you helped him in his dressing room, and left together. </p><p>Next day he was a little flustered. When you arrived to New York and checked in the hotel, he went to your room.
