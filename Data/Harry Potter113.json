Moving over to the empty couch you sat and allowed yourself to sink into it\u2019s comfort after a long day of classes, with O.W.L\u2019s coming up fast you felt as if you barely had time to breathe with all the homework the professors were cramming down your throats, not to mention you felt like Lily, your best friend, was going to make you study to death.</p><p>\u201cHey (L/N)\u201d A familiar voice called out to you.</p><p><b>You looked me in the eye and I wanted to erase myself (erase myself)</b></p><p>Glancing over your (e/c) eyes were met with stormy gray ones, the eyes that belonged to the famous Sirius Black, fellow fifth year and flirt extraordinaire, you\u2019d be lying if you said you didn\u2019t find him attractive. However, except for when Lily was around, you rarely spoke to the marauders so this situation caused you to internally panic and wish you had just went up to your dorm.</p><p>\u201cYes Sirius?\u201d You asked politely trying to keep your nerves from showing through.</p><p>A playful smirk danced across his lips which enhanced his handsome features, you felt as if your heart was beating faster from it alone.</p><p>\u201cStrawberries or blueberries?\u201d he asked.<br/></p><p>You blinked in confusion as your eyebrows knitted together to physically illustrate your emotion\u00a0\u201cExcuse me?\u201d.</p><p>He chuckled\u00a0\u201cWhich do you prefer?\u201d.</p><p>\u201cOh uhm..\u201d you paused as you chewed your bottom lip in thought\u00a0\u201cI guess i\u2019d have to say strawberries.\u201d.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a romantic than huh?\u201d James asked looking over to you.<br/></p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see how that makes me a romantic Potter.\u201d you snorted.<br/></p><p>\u201cOuch, why does Padfoot get the first name treatment and not me?\u201d he pouted<br/></p><p><b>I didn\u2019t wanna fall, but then I stepped right in</b></p><p>\u201cI like him better.\u201d you joked laughing a bit as you got to your feet.<br/></p><p>Unknowing to you, when you said that Sirius had felt his heart skip a beat.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m heading up to my dorm, try not to stay up too late boys.\u201d you waves a hand as you moved towards the stairs to the girls dormitory.<br/></p><p>\u201cYes Mother.\u201d James called after you.<br/></p><p>You listened as the other three boys laughed before shaking your head and heading up, they were immature sure, but they were entertaining.</p><p>Stepping into your dorm you noticed Lily absorbed in her studies per usual, quills and parchment scattered around her as she was pouring over her transfiguration textbook.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t bother trying to talk to her.\u201d One of your other friends, Marlene said from her four poster\u00a0\u201cShe hasn\u2019t moved since you guys got back from the library.\u201d.<br/></p><p>Sighing you snatched the book from the red heads hands before holding it out of reach when she tried to grab it\u00a0\u201cLils\u2019 you need to rest, your brain is going to be mush if you don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Lily pouted as she held out her hand to you\u00a0\u201cGive it back, I just have one more chapter left to go over.\u201d.</p><p>\u201cA chapter that will turn into the rest of the text book?\u201d you asked as you crossed you arms.<br/></p><p>Groaning in defeat your best friend gathered her things before putting them away\u00a0\u201cFine, only because I know you\u2019re right.\u201d.</p><p>\u201cWhen am I not?\u201d you grinned finally handing the book back.<br/></p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t push it.\u201d Lily laughed.<br/></p><p><b>I looked down at the ground and I felt it right within</b></p><p>\u201cWhere have you been anyway?\u201d Alice, another friend of yours asked sleepily.<br/></p><p>\u201cThe couch looked comfy.\u201d you shrugged as you sat down on your own bed glancing down at your shoes.</p><p>\u201cDid something happen?\u201d Lily asked looking to you.<br/></p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d you glanced up once more not realizing the blush that had spread on your cheeks.<br/></p><p>The three girls ooh\u2019d at you and you suddenly felt the burning heat in your face\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDetails.\u201d Marlene demanded as the three girls moved closer to you.<br/></p><p>\u201cN-Nothing happened! I just talked with the boys.\u201d you shrugged looking away.<br/></p><p>Lily smirked\u00a0\u201cSirius talked to you huh?.</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d you mumbled as you undid your tie\u00a0\u201cIt wasn\u2019t like we had this momentous conversation, he just asked my opinion on fruit.\u201d.<br/></p><p>They all looked just as confused as you had been a few minutes ago</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s-\u201d Alice began<br/></p><p>\u201cWeird.\u201d Marlene finished<br/></p><p>\u201cI know, and when I said strawberries James accused me of being a romantic.\u201d you sighed running a hand through your (H/L and H/C) hair.<br/></p><p>\u201cThey must be planning something.\u201d Lily sighed\u00a0\u201cProbably a prank.\u201d.<br/></p><p>\u201cOoh fun.\u201d you spoke sarcastically.<br/></p><p>\u201cWhy would they prank (Y/N) though?\u201d Marlene asked\u00a0\u201cThey all seem fond of her, especially Sirius.\u201d.<br/></p><p><b>It was too late for me (too late for her)</b></p><p>After changing the subject and bit more banter the others and yourself got ready for bed, however as you laid in your four poster staring at the ceiling your mind was filled with Sirius, your stomach was filled with butterflies and your body almost ached or his touch and warmth despite having never felt it before in the five years of knowing him.</p><p>\u2018Stop it\u2019 you thought to yourself\u00a0\u2018Sirius has a reputation, I shouldn\u2019t get my hopes up.\u2019.</p><p>With one last soft sigh you drifted off to sleep</p><p><b>You took a step forward and tilted your head, with a curious glance you stared and I felt like dead</b></p><p>Walking down the stairs to the common room you noticed that Sirius was standing at the bottom of them talking to another fifth year girl, you hated yourself for the jealousy that washed over you, it wasn\u2019t as if Sirius was even remotely close to being yours, but to see him talking to another girl stung, nonetheless you continued your way down.</p><p>As you approached the bottom you noticed Sirius\u2019s attention turn to you as he tilted his head with a look of curiosity in his gray eyes as he moved towards you closing the distance\u00a0</p><p><b>Oh my god I think i\u2019m dying</b></p><p>He gave you a small smile that nearly made you melt\u00a0\u00a0<b>\u201cHey.\u201d.</b></p><p><b>\u201cHello.\u201d </b>you replied as you two met on the bottom stair<br/></p><p><b><strike>\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?

Had Sirius Black just asked you on a date? No, no he had to mean it as friend surely.</p><p>\u201cAre James and the others coming too?\u201d you asked adjusting your bag.</p><p>\u201cNo, just us, a date would be awkward with them along for the ride.\u201d he smirked<br/></p><p><b>I just stared and you grinned and looked right back, it felt like just one big whirlwind.</b></p><p>\u201cA-Alright than.\u201d you managed still completely caught off guard.<br/></p><p>He took your hand and placed a kiss on it\u2019s back\u00a0\u201cSee you in potions (L/N).\u201d and he was gone.</p><p>You continued to stand there in shock until Lily shook you and brought you back to earth</p><p><b>One big emotional whirlwind.</b></p><p>\u201cAre you alright (Y/N)?\u201d Lily asked as you looked to her\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ve been trying to get your attention for like five minutes now.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cI..\u201d you finally spoke\u00a0\u201cI have a date with Sirius this weekend?\u201d you said still unsure whether if this was real or not<br/></p><p>\u201cWait what?!\u201d Marlene said a she joined the two of you.<br/></p><p>\u201c(Y/N) has a date with Black.\u201d Lily smirked looking to your friend.<br/></p><p>Marlene wiggled her eyebrows as she walked past the two of you humming about how you and Sirius were sitting in a tree soon to be k-i-s-s-i-n-g</p><p>\u201cMarlene!\u201d You whined chasing after her as a laughing Lily followed you guys to the great hall for breakfast.<br/></p><p><b>Over the next few days we got to talking, with every single word I started falling</b></p><p>You sat in the common room laughing quietly to yourself from behind your book as you listened to James try to persuade Lily into a date for the third time that day</p><p>\u201cNot in this lifetime Potter.\u201d Lily said as she turned a page in her own book.<br/></p><p>\u201cThen in the next perhaps.\u201d James seemed to purr<br/></p><p>You snorted as you brought your book closer to yourself to avoid Lily\u2019s glare</p><p>\u201cSince when do you purr Prongs?\u201d Sirius asked from beside his best friend.<br/></p><p>\u201cHard not to when talking to someone as purr-fect as Evans.\u201d James winked and the sound of Lily\u2019s gag made you lose it as you completely buried your face in you book<br/></p><p>\u201cSomeone is giggly today.\u201d Sirius smiled removing the book from your face.<br/></p><p>You were still laughing as you smiled up at me\u00a0\u201cHard not to laugh when Potter\u2019s pick up lines keep getting worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a bad as Peter\u2019s jokes.\u201d Remus said as he walked through the portrait hole with Peter himself in tow.<br/></p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d Peter huffed which earned a laugh from the five of you\u00a0<br/></p><p>Sirius took the empty seat on the couch beside you and leaned closer\u00a0\u201cNot a fan of pick up lines?\u201d he whispered.</p><p>Fighting back a blush you glanced to him\u00a0\u201cDepends who is saying them.\u201d</p><p>His usual smirk seemed to ooze cockiness\u00a0\u201cAnd if they were from me?\u201d</p><p><b>Farther, farther, and farther for you</b></p><p>\u201cThen I might just like them.\u201d you admitted\u00a0<br/></p><p>He gently tucked your (H/C) locks behind your ear\u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s good to hear.\u201d</p><p>A clearing of the throat snapped both of your attentions back to James\u00a0\u201cNo flirting while i\u2019m trying to woo my future wife Padfoot.\u201d.</p><p>Lily rolled her eyes and grabbed your arm\u00a0\u201cCome on (Y/N) we\u2019ll just study in the dorm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh uhm, alright.\u201d you glanced to Sirius feeling a bit sad before grabbing your book and following her\u00a0\u201cSee you later guys.\u201d.<br/></p><p>\u201cNot if we see you first.\u201d Peter called to you and his three friends groaned.<br/></p><p><b>You were so witty, and so charming, you swept me of my feet</b></p><p>However Sirius did up seeing you first, he had snuck down to the kitchen for a midnight snack to see you had done the same, your back to him as you talked to one of the house elves.</p><p>Smirking he quietly moved behind you and pulled you into a backwards hug\u00a0\u201cBoo!\u201d.</p><p>You nearly jumped out of your skin as you spun around quickly to see who had scared you\u00a0\u201cSirius!\u201d you whisper yelled.</p><p>He chuckled\u00a0\u201cSurprised to see me?\u201d.</p><p>You nodded\u00a0\u201cI shouldn\u2019t be though, even the house elves thought it was you sneaking in when I first arrived.\u201d.</p><p>He chuckled as he still held onto you close to him \u201cyeah I suppose I have a reputation.\u201d.</p><p>Reputation, the word that hung in your head every time you longed to get closer to Sirius, the word that kept you from admitting just how you felt about the messy haired Gryfindor who was currently holding you in his arms.</p><p>You gently pushed away from him and walked over to a counter hoisting yourself to sit on it\u00a0\u201cGetting a snack?\u201d.</p><p>He nodded as he grabbed a pumpkin pastie and leaned against the counter beside you\u00a0\u201cAre we still on for Hogsmeade tomorrow?\u201d he asked after swallowing the bite he had taken.</p><p>Nodding you sipped your tea\u00a0\u201cDid you think i\u2019d chicken out?\u201d you joked.</p><p>Sirius chuckled\u00a0\u201cTo be honest I was surprised you agreed, seeing as we rarely talked before, though to be honest i\u2019ve always been curious about you.\u201d his smirked turned into a small smile as he looked to you.</p><p>You blushed softly\u00a0\u201cSirius Black interested in little old me?\u201d you laughed a bit\u00a0\u201cWhy is that?.</p><p>\u201cWell.\u201d he moved so he was in front of you, putting his arms on either side of you as he trapped you in your spot\u00a0\u201cI remember in first year you got lost, but you were too stubborn to ask for directions so, you pressed on and ended up walking into potions with five minutes to spare.\u201d<br/></p><p>Your whole face turned red\u00a0\u201cGee what other embarrassing thing do you remember?\u201d you snarked glancing to the side.</p><p>He chuckled\u00a0\u201cIn third year on our first hogsmeade trip I remember Remus was low on funds so you paid for the rest of his honeydukes for him.\u201d.</p><p>\u201cWell that\u2019s-\u201d he held up a finger stopping you.<br/></p><p>\u201cFourth year you stood up for a first year who was being bullied despite the fact that I can tell you hate confrontation.\u201d he continued.<br/></p><p>\u201cWhat are you getting at?\u201d You finally asked.<br/></p><p>\u201c(L/N) you are the most amazing girl i\u2019ve ever met let alone get the honor of being friends with, You\u2019re stubborn sure, but you\u2019re also determined, caring, sweet, compassionate&hellip;You\u2019re amazing (F/N) and I love you.\u201d he admitted glancing away slightly, a light blush on his cheeks.<br/></p><p>You were shocked into silence once again thanks to Sirius, you opened your mouth to speak, but no words came out so you closed it whilst feeling your face heat up so hot you thought it was gonna melt off.</p><p><b>You made me laugh, you made me blush, no one could compete (no one could compete)</b></p><p>\u201cI-I love you too Sirius.\u201d you finally managed after about a minute.<br/></p><p>He looked back to you as a wide smile spread across his face\u00a0\u201cReally?\u201d.</p><p>You couldn\u2019t help the laugh that escaped his lips, if you didn\u2019t know any better you would think he was wagging the tail he didn\u2019t have\u00a0\u201cOf course, I have no reason to lie.\u201d.</p><p>Pulling you into a tight hug Sirius pressed a kiss to forehead\u00a0\u201cYou have no idea how long i\u2019ve waited to hear you say that?\u201d he mumbled into your hair.</p><p>\u201cHow long?\u201d you asked as your head rested on his chest, the beating of his heart soothing you.<br/></p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been in love with you since that day you walked into potions late during first year and asked Slughorn why on earth Hogwarts had a dungeon.\u201d he snorted at the memory.<br/></p><p><b>It seemed to good to be true (It seemed to good to be true.)</b></p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d you asked surprised<br/></p><p>He nodded\u00a0\u201cWhat about you? How long have you been in love with me? Since puberty?\u201d.</p><p><b>I wanted to be with you (only with you)</b></p><p>You shook your head\u00a0\u201cSecond year actually, we were in transfiguration and another Gryffindor was having trouble and while McGonagall wasn\u2019t watching you helped them out.\u201d you smiled at the cute memory.</p><p>He blushed softly\u00a0\u201cDidn\u2019t think anyone had seen that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll find i\u2019m very observant.\u201d you giggled and heard the clock chime\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s getting late, we should both get to bed.\u201d</p><p>He pouted\u00a0\u201cI wanna be with you though.\u201d</p><p>Your heart skipped a beat as you gave him a small smile\u00a0\u201cWell if we go to sleep, the sooner tomorrow comes for our date right?\u201d.</p><p>\u201cFair point love.\u201d he sighed as he hung his head in defeat\u00a0\u201cMay I walk you back to your dorm than?\u201d.</p><p>You nodded and got to your feet as he stepped back\u00a0\u201cI\u2019d like that.\u201d.</p><p><b>\u00a0We clicked like legos, or the clacking of tap shoes</b></p><p>The following morning Sirius was yet again waiting for you at the bottom of the stairs, a smile on his face as you finally appeared</p><p><b>\u201cHey.\u201d </b>he said taking one of you hands in his<br/></p><p><b>\u201cHello, how was your day?\u201d</b> you asked glancing to your joined hands.<br/></p><p><b>\u201cBetter now.\u201d</b> he replied still smiling as he kissed you hand.<br/></p><p><b>What a clich\u00e9, but to be honest it made my day.</b></p><p>The two of you walks around hogsmeade taking in the scene whilst stopping in at places like Honeydukes to get treats and The three broomsticks for a hot butterbeer to warm up from the cold.</p><p>\u201cWarm enough love?\u201d Sirius asked as he noticed you pulling your coat closer to yourself.<br/></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m alright.\u201d you replied as you sipped your butterbeer\u00a0\u201cI forgot how cold it is here in the winter is all.\u201d.<br/></p><p>Chuckling he wrapped an arm around you as he pulled you closer\u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s what winter does.\u201d he said pressing a kiss to your temple.</p><p>\u201cOh shush, it\u2019s not my fault I get cold easily.\u201d you huffed.<br/></p><p>\u201cThan it\u2019s a good thing you have a boyfriend whose a walking heater.\u201d<br/></p><p>Boyfriend, the word echoed in your head causing your heart to beat faster. Sirius Black was your boyfriend now.</p><p><b>I didn\u2019t wanna fall, but then I stepped right in. I looked up at your face and those eyes they drew me in</b></p><p>You had almost forgotten how beautiful Sirius\u2019s eyes were as you looked up at him, his face so close to yours that you could feel his hot breath on your neck. He leaned in closer, his nose now brushing yours and making it hard for you to breathe normally</p><p>\u201cSiri-\u201d you began, but were cut off my his lips softly crashing into your in a shy yet passionate kiss<br/></p><p><b>It was too late for me</b></p><p>When he pulled away he rested his forehead on yours, his gray eyes never leaving your (E/C) ones \u201cFirst kiss?\u201d he asked.</p><p>You nodded as your fingers absentmindedly brushed over your lips\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m glad it was with you though.\u201d.</p><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d he smirked and leaned in kissing you again though this time with a slight bit more force and greed attached, though you were more than happy to oblige to any type of kisses from him.<br/></p><p>He was your first love and it seemed you were his</p><p><b>That\u2019s what we were, a simple clich\u00e9, it wasn\u2019t made to work, but I wouldn\u2019t have it any other way (any other way).</b></p><p>Time passed and it became well known that you were Sirius\u2019s and that he was yours, though that didn\u2019t seem to stop girls from trying to steal him from you, not that you could blame them really, he was Sirius Black after all, but as Sirius told them countless times, he was yours and only yours no matter what happened in the end</p><p>Sixth year was finally here and you sat in your compartment quietly reading, Lily had left to find the restroom which left you waiting for the others and as per usual the marauders all arrived together, Sirius making a b line for you before pulling you into a tight hug and pressing kissed all over your face causing you to giggle</p><p>\u201cI missed you so much.\u201d he said sitting down with you in his lap.<br/></p><p>\u201cI missed you too Siri.\u2019 you smiled kissing his cheek<br/></p><p>Lily walked in to see this and gave a awe while James and the other look repulsed</p><p><b>You were so witty, and so charming, you swept me of my feet.

ride.\u201d he smirked<br></p><p><b>I just stared and you grinned and looked right back, it felt like just one big whirlwind.</b></p><p>\u201cA-Alright than.\u201d you managed still completely caught off guard.<br></p><p>He took your hand and placed a kiss on it\u2019s back\u00a0\u201cSee you in potions (L/N).\u201d and he was gone.</p><p>You continued to stand there in shock until Lily shook you and brought you back to earth</p><p><b>One big emotional whirlwind.</b></p><p>\u201cAre you alright (Y/N)?\u201d Lily asked as you looked to her\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ve been trying to get your attention for like five minutes now.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI..\u201d you finally spoke\u00a0\u201cI have a date with Sirius this weekend?\u201d you said still unsure whether if this was real or not<br></p><p>\u201cWait what?!\u201d Marlene said a she joined the two of you.<br></p><p>\u201c(Y/N) has a date with Black.\u201d Lily smirked looking to your friend.<br></p><p>Marlene wiggled her eyebrows as she walked past the two of you humming about how you and Sirius were sitting in a tree soon to be k-i-s-s-i-n-g</p><p>\u201cMarlene!\u201d You whined chasing after her as a laughing Lily followed you guys to the great hall for breakfast.<br></p><p><b>Over the next few days we got to talking, with every single word I started falling</b></p><p>You sat in the common room laughing quietly to yourself from behind your book as you listened to James try to persuade Lily into a date for the third time that day</p><p>\u201cNot in this lifetime Potter.\u201d Lily said as she turned a page in her own book.<br></p><p>\u201cThen in the next perhaps.\u201d James seemed to purr<br></p><p>You snorted as you brought your book closer to yourself to avoid Lily\u2019s glare</p><p>\u201cSince when do you purr Prongs?\u201d Sirius asked from beside his best friend.<br></p><p>\u201cHard not to when talking to someone as purr-fect as Evans.\u201d James winked and the sound of Lily\u2019s gag made you lose it as you completely buried your face in you book<br></p><p>\u201cSomeone is giggly today.\u201d Sirius smiled removing the book from your face.<br></p><p>You were still laughing as you smiled up at me\u00a0\u201cHard not to laugh when Potter\u2019s pick up lines keep getting worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a bad as Peter\u2019s jokes.\u201d Remus said as he walked through the portrait hole with Peter himself in tow.<br></p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d Peter huffed which earned a laugh from the five of you\u00a0<br></p><p>Sirius took the empty seat on the couch beside you and leaned closer\u00a0\u201cNot a fan of pick up lines?\u201d he whispered.</p><p>Fighting back a blush you glanced to him\u00a0\u201cDepends who is saying them.\u201d</p><p>His usual smirk seemed to ooze cockiness\u00a0\u201cAnd if they were from me?\u201d</p><p><b>Farther, farther, and farther for you</b></p><p>\u201cThen I might just like them.\u201d you admitted\u00a0<br></p><p>He gently tucked your (H/C) locks behind your ear\u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s good to hear.\u201d</p><p>A clearing of the throat snapped both of your attentions back to James\u00a0\u201cNo flirting while i\u2019m trying to woo my future wife Padfoot.\u201d.</p><p>Lily rolled her eyes and grabbed your arm\u00a0\u201cCome on (Y/N) we\u2019ll just study in the dorm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh uhm, alright.\u201d you glanced to Sirius feeling a bit sad before grabbing your book and following her\u00a0\u201cSee you later guys.\u201d.<br></p><p>\u201cNot if we see you first.\u201d Peter called to you and his three friends groaned.<br></p><p><b>You were so witty, and so charming, you swept me of my feet</b></p><p>However Sirius did up seeing you first, he had snuck down to the kitchen for a midnight snack to see you had done the same, your back to him as you talked to one of the house elves.</p><p>Smirking he quietly moved behind you and pulled you into a backwards hug\u00a0\u201cBoo!\u201d.</p><p>You nearly jumped out of your skin as you spun around quickly to see who had scared you\u00a0\u201cSirius!\u201d you whisper yelled.</p><p>He chuckled\u00a0\u201cSurprised to see me?\u201d.</p><p>You nodded\u00a0\u201cI shouldn\u2019t be though, even the house elves thought it was you sneaking in when I first arrived.\u201d.</p><p>He chuckled as he still held onto you close to him \u201cyeah I suppose I have a reputation.\u201d.</p><p>Reputation, the word that hung in your head every time you longed to get closer to Sirius, the word that kept you from admitting just how you felt about the messy haired Gryfindor who was currently holding you in his arms.</p><p>You gently pushed away from him and walked over to a counter hoisting yourself to sit on it\u00a0\u201cGetting a snack?\u201d.</p><p>He nodded as he grabbed a pumpkin pastie and leaned against the counter beside you\u00a0\u201cAre we still on for Hogsmeade tomorrow?\u201d he asked after swallowing the bite he had taken.</p><p>Nodding you sipped your tea\u00a0\u201cDid you think i\u2019d chicken out?\u201d you joked.</p><p>Sirius chuckled\u00a0\u201cTo be honest I was surprised you agreed, seeing as we rarely talked before, though to be honest i\u2019ve always been curious about you.\u201d his smirked turned into a small smile as he looked to you.</p><p>You blushed softly\u00a0\u201cSirius Black interested in little old me?\u201d you laughed a bit\u00a0\u201cWhy is that?.</p><p>\u201cWell.\u201d he moved so he was in front of you, putting his arms on either side of you as he trapped you in your spot\u00a0\u201cI remember in first year you got lost, but you were too stubborn to ask for directions so, you pressed on and ended up walking into potions with five minutes to spare.\u201d<br></p><p>Your whole face turned red\u00a0\u201cGee what other embarrassing thing do you remember?\u201d you snarked glancing to the side.</p><p>He chuckled\u00a0\u201cIn third year on our first hogsmeade trip I remember Remus was low on funds so you paid for the rest of his honeydukes for him.\u201d.</p><p>\u201cWell that\u2019s-\u201d he held up a finger stopping you.<br></p><p>\u201cFourth year you stood up for a first year who was being bullied despite the fact that I can tell you hate confrontation.\u201d he continued.<br></p><p>\u201cWhat are you getting at?\u201d You finally asked.<br></p><p>\u201c(L/N) you are the most amazing girl i\u2019ve ever met let alone get the honor of being friends with, You\u2019re stubborn sure, but you\u2019re also determined, caring, sweet, compassionate\u2026You\u2019re amazing (F/N) and I love you.\u201d he admitted glancing away slightly, a light blush on his cheeks.<br></p><p>You were shocked into silence once again thanks to Sirius, you opened your mouth to speak, but no words came out so you closed it whilst feeling your face heat up so hot you thought it was gonna melt off.</p><p><b>You made me laugh, you made me blush, no one could compete (no one could compete)</b></p><p>\u201cI-I love you too Sirius.\u201d you finally managed after about a minute.<br></p><p>He looked back to you as a wide smile spread across his face\u00a0\u201cReally?\u201d.</p><p>You couldn\u2019t help the laugh that escaped his lips, if you didn\u2019t know any better you would think he was wagging the tail he didn\u2019t have\u00a0\u201cOf course, I have no reason to lie.\u201d.</p><p>Pulling you into a tight hug Sirius pressed a kiss to forehead\u00a0\u201cYou have no idea how long i\u2019ve waited to hear you say that?\u201d he mumbled into your hair.</p><p>\u201cHow long?\u201d you asked as your head rested on his chest, the beating of his heart soothing you.<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been in love with you since that day you walked into potions late during first year and asked Slughorn why on earth Hogwarts had a dungeon.\u201d he snorted at the memory.<br></p><p><b>It seemed to good to be true (It seemed to good to be true.)</b></p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d you asked surprised<br></p><p>He nodded\u00a0\u201cWhat about you? How long have you been in love with me? Since puberty?\u201d.</p><p><b>I wanted to be with you (only with you)</b></p><p>You shook your head\u00a0\u201cSecond year actually, we were in transfiguration and another Gryffindor was having trouble and while McGonagall wasn\u2019t watching you helped them out.\u201d you smiled at the cute memory.</p><p>He blushed softly\u00a0\u201cDidn\u2019t think anyone had seen that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll find i\u2019m very observant.\u201d you giggled and heard the clock chime\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s getting late, we should both get to bed.\u201d</p><p>He pouted\u00a0\u201cI wanna be with you though.\u201d</p><p>Your heart skipped a beat as you gave him a small smile\u00a0\u201cWell if we go to sleep, the sooner tomorrow comes for our date right?\u201d.</p><p>\u201cFair point love.\u201d he sighed as he hung his head in defeat\u00a0\u201cMay I walk you back to your dorm than?\u201d.</p><p>You nodded and got to your feet as he stepped back\u00a0\u201cI\u2019d like that.\u201d.</p><p><b>\u00a0We clicked like legos, or the clacking of tap shoes</b></p><p>The following morning Sirius was yet again waiting for you at the bottom of the stairs, a smile on his face as you finally appeared</p><p><b>\u201cHey.\u201d </b>he said taking one of you hands in his<br></p><p><b>\u201cHello, how was your day?\u201d</b> you asked glancing to your joined hands.<br></p><p><b>\u201cBetter now.\u201d</b> he replied still smiling as he kissed you hand.<br></p><p><b>What a clich\u00e9, but to be honest it made my day.</b></p><p>The two of you walks around hogsmeade taking in the scene whilst stopping in at places like Honeydukes to get treats and The three broomsticks for a hot butterbeer to warm up from the cold.</p><p>\u201cWarm enough love?\u201d Sirius asked as he noticed you pulling your coat closer to yourself.<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m alright.\u201d you replied as you sipped your butterbeer\u00a0\u201cI forgot how cold it is here in the winter is all.\u201d.<br></p><p>Chuckling he wrapped an arm around you as he pulled you closer\u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s what winter does.\u201d he said pressing a kiss to your temple.</p><p>\u201cOh shush, it\u2019s not my fault I get cold easily.\u201d you huffed.<br></p><p>\u201cThan it\u2019s a good thing you have a boyfriend whose a walking heater.\u201d<br></p><p>Boyfriend, the word echoed in your head causing your heart to beat faster. Sirius Black was your boyfriend now.</p><p><b>I didn\u2019t wanna fall, but then I stepped right in. I looked up at your face and those eyes they drew me in</b></p><p>You had almost forgotten how beautiful Sirius\u2019s eyes were as you looked up at him, his face so close to yours that you could feel his hot breath on your neck. He leaned in closer, his nose now brushing yours and making it hard for you to breathe normally</p><p>\u201cSiri-\u201d you began, but were cut off my his lips softly crashing into your in a shy yet passionate kiss<br></p><p><b>It was too late for me</b></p><p>When he pulled away he rested his forehead on yours, his gray eyes never leaving your (E/C) ones \u201cFirst kiss?\u201d he asked.</p><p>You nodded as your fingers absentmindedly brushed over your lips\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m glad it was with you though.\u201d.</p><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d he smirked and leaned in kissing you again though this time with a slight bit more force and greed attached, though you were more than happy to oblige to any type of kisses from him.<br></p><p>He was your first love and it seemed you were his</p><p><b>That\u2019s what we were, a simple clich\u00e9, it wasn\u2019t made to work, but I wouldn\u2019t have it any other way (any other way).</b></p><p>Time passed and it became well known that you were Sirius\u2019s and that he was yours, though that didn\u2019t seem to stop girls from trying to steal him from you, not that you could blame them really, he was Sirius Black after all, but as Sirius told them countless times, he was yours and only yours no matter what happened in the end</p><p>Sixth year was finally here and you sat in your compartment quietly reading, Lily had left to find the restroom which left you waiting for the others and as per usual the marauders all arrived together, Sirius making a b line for you before pulling you into a tight hug and pressing kissed all over your face causing you to giggle</p><p>\u201cI missed you so much.\u201d he said sitting down with you in his lap.<br></p><p>\u201cI missed you too Siri.\u2019 you smiled kissing his cheek<br></p><p>Lily walked in to see this and gave a awe while James and the other look repulsed</p><p><b>You were so witty, and so charming, you swept me of my feet. You made me laugh, you made me blush, no one could compete (no one could compete)</b></p><p>\u201cOh hush Prongs.\u201d Sirius joked pulling you closer so Lily had room to sit\u00a0\u201cYou too Moony and Wormtail, i\u2019m in love.\u201d.</p><p>\u201cOi i\u2019m in love with Evans too, but you don\u2019t see my kissing all over her face.\u201d Potter pouted<br></p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because if you tried i\u2019d turn you into a toad.\u201d Lily stated with no hesitation.<br></p><p>\u201cAs long as princess Evans kisses me and turns me back that\u2019s just fine.\u201d he winked and everyone else in the compartment groaned in protest.<br></p><p><b>It seemed too good to be true (it seemed too good to be true), I wanted to be with you (only with you).</b></p><p>Time passed on through the school year and you and Sirius were still acting as if he had just confessed yesterday, two touch starved teens always acting as if it had been forever since you had seen the other during breaks despite having classes together and the same common room, nonetheless the two of you were happy/</p><p><b>We clicked like legos, or the clacking of tap shoes</b></p><p>Waking up one morning, your body was tangled with Sirius\u2019s as you caught him watching you\u00a0</p><p><b>\u201cHey.\u201d</b> he said as played with a lock of you hair.<br></p><p><b>\u201cHello.\u201d</b> you smiled moving up to kiss him softly which he gladly returned.<br></p><p>You thought about the dream you had, you were marrying Sirius, a question bubbled up inside of you\u00a0\u201cCan I ask you a question?\u201d.</p><p>\u201cOf course love.\u201d he said, a hand rubbing circles on your lower back.<br></p><p>\u201cI had a dream that we were getting married and while I love that idea, <b>I gotta know do you feel this way</b> too?\u201d you asked<br></p><p>He smiled as he placed a kiss on your forehead\u00a0\u201cY<b>eah, I do, but I was scared of what you might say</b> if I brought it up.\u201d he admitted.</p><p>\u201cI would have said that let\u2019s do it, after graduation let\u2019s get married.\u201d you replied and watched as his smile grew wider before he kissed you deeply.<br></p><p><b>And that\u2019s all we were, a silly\n\nclich\u00e9\n\n</b></p><p>As you stood at the alter saying your I do\u2019s Sirius mouth\u00a0\u201c<b>I still think you\u2019re cute, but maybe it\u2019s better this way</b> as right now you look beautiful.\u201d.</p><p>And before you could reply the priest had announced that Sirius could now kiss his bride and his lips were on yours as soon as the words had been spoken.</p><p>\u201cI love you (Y/N).\u201d Sirius whispered as he pulled away<br></p><p>\u201cI love you too Sirius.\u201d you whispered back<br></p><p><b>That\u2019s okay, we\u2019re just a little clich\u00e9, a little clich\u00e9, but that\u2019s okay!</b></p>",

followed you guys to the great hall for breakfast.<br></p><p><b>Over the next few days we got to talking, with every single word I started falling</b></p><p>You sat in the common room laughing quietly to yourself from behind your book as you listened to James try to persuade Lily into a date for the third time that day</p><p>\u201cNot in this lifetime Potter.\u201d Lily said as she turned a page in her own book.<br></p><p>\u201cThen in the next perhaps.\u201d James seemed to purr<br></p><p>You snorted as you brought your book closer to yourself to avoid Lily\u2019s glare</p><p>\u201cSince when

hole with Peter himself in tow.<br></p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d Peter huffed which earned a laugh from the five of you\u00a0<br></p><p>Sirius took the empty seat on the couch beside you and leaned closer\u00a0\u201cNot a fan of pick up lines?\u201d he whispered.</p><p>Fighting back a blush you glanced to him\u00a0\u201cDepends who is saying them.\u201d</p><p>His usual smirk seemed to ooze cockiness\u00a0\u201cAnd if they were from me?\u201d</p><p><b>Farther, farther, and farther for you</b></p><p>\u201cThen I might just like them.\u201d you admitted\u00a0<br></p><p>He gently tucked your (H/C) locks behind your ear\u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s good to hear.\u201d</p><p>A clearing of the throat snapped both of your attentions back to James\u00a0\u201cNo flirting while i\u2019m trying to

Sirius feeling a bit sad before grabbing your book and following her\u00a0\u201cSee you later guys.\u201d.<br></p><p>\u201cNot if we see you first.\u201d Peter called to you and his three friends groaned.<br></p><p><b>You were so witty, and so charming, you swept me of my feet</b></p><p>However Sirius did up seeing you first, he had snuck down to the kitchen for a midnight snack to see you had done the same, your back to him as you talked to one of the house elves.</p><p>Smirking he quietly moved behind you and pulled you into a backwards hug\u00a0\u201cBoo!\u201d.</p><p>You nearly jumped out of your skin as you spun around quickly to see who had scared you\u00a0\u201cSirius!\u201d you whisper yelled.</p><p>He chuckled\u00a0\u201cSurprised to see me?\u201d.</p><p>You nodded\u00a0\u201cI shouldn\u2019t be though, even the house elves thought it was you sneaking in when I first arrived.\u201d.</p><p>He chuckled as he still held onto you close to him \u201cyeah I suppose I have a reputation.\u201d.</p><p>Reputation, the word that hung in your head every time you longed to get closer to Sirius, the word that kept you from admitting just how you felt about the messy haired Gryfindor who was currently holding you in his arms.</p><p>You gently pushed away from him and walked over to a counter hoisting yourself to sit on it\u00a0\u201cGetting a snack?\u201d.</p><p>He nodded as he grabbed a pumpkin pastie and leaned against the counter beside you\u00a0\u201cAre we still on for Hogsmeade tomorrow?\u201d he asked after swallowing the bite he had taken.</p><p>Nodding you sipped your tea\u00a0\u201cDid you think i\u2019d chicken out?\u201d you joked.</p><p>Sirius chuckled\u00a0\u201cTo be honest I was surprised you agreed, seeing as we rarely talked before, though to be honest i\u2019ve always been curious about you.\u201d his smirked turned into a small smile as he looked to you.</p><p>You blushed softly\u00a0\u201cSirius Black interested in little old me?\u201d you laughed a bit\u00a0\u201cWhy is that?.</p><p>\u201cWell.\u201d he moved so he was in front of you, putting his arms on either side of you as he trapped you in your spot\u00a0\u201cI remember in first year you got lost, but you were too stubborn to ask for directions so, you pressed on and ended up walking into potions with five minutes to spare.\u201d<br></p><p>Your whole face turned red\u00a0\u201cGee what other embarrassing thing do you remember?\u201d you snarked glancing to the side.</p><p>He chuckled\u00a0\u201cIn third year on our first hogsmeade trip I remember Remus was low on funds so you paid for the rest of his honeydukes for him.\u201d.</p><p>\u201cWell that\u2019s-\u201d he held up a finger stopping you.<br></p><p>\u201cFourth year you stood up for a first year who was being bullied despite the fact that I can tell you hate confrontation.\u201d he continued.<br></p><p>\u201cWhat are you getting at?\u201d You finally asked.<br></p><p>\u201c(L/N) you are the most amazing girl i\u2019ve ever met let alone get the honor of being friends with, You\u2019re stubborn sure, but you\u2019re also determined, caring, sweet, compassionate\u2026You\u2019re amazing (F/N) and I love you.\u201d he admitted glancing away slightly, a light blush on his cheeks.<br></p><p>You were shocked into silence once again thanks to Sirius, you opened your mouth to speak, but no words came out so you closed it whilst feeling your face heat up so hot you thought it was gonna melt off.</p><p><b>You made me laugh, you made me blush, no one could compete (no one could compete)</b></p><p>\u201cI-I love you too Sirius.\u201d you finally managed after about a minute.<br></p><p>He looked back to you as a wide smile spread across his face\u00a0\u201cReally?\u201d.</p><p>You couldn\u2019t help the laugh that escaped his lips, if you didn\u2019t know any better you would think he was wagging the tail he didn\u2019t have\u00a0\u201cOf course, I have no reason to lie.\u201d.</p><p>Pulling you into a tight hug Sirius pressed a kiss to forehead\u00a0\u201cYou have no idea how long i\u2019ve waited to hear you say that?\u201d he mumbled into your hair.</p><p>\u201cHow long?\u201d you asked as your head rested on his chest, the beating of his heart soothing you.<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been in love with you since that day you walked into potions late during first year and asked Slughorn why on earth Hogwarts had a dungeon.\u201d he snorted at the memory.<br></p><p><b>It seemed to good to be true (It seemed to good to be true.)</b></p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d you asked surprised<br></p><p>He nodded\u00a0\u201cWhat about you? How long have you been in love with me? Since puberty?\u201d.</p><p><b>I wanted to be with you (only with you)</b></p><p>You shook your head\u00a0\u201cSecond year actually, we were in transfiguration and another Gryffindor was having trouble and while McGonagall wasn\u2019t watching you helped them out.\u201d you smiled at the cute memory.</p><p>He blushed softly\u00a0\u201cDidn\u2019t think anyone had seen that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll find i\u2019m very observant.\u201d you giggled and heard the clock chime\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s getting late, we should both get to bed.\u201d</p><p>He pouted\u00a0\u201cI wanna be with you though.\u201d</p><p>Your heart skipped a beat as you gave him a small smile\u00a0\u201cWell if we go to sleep, the sooner tomorrow comes for our date right?\u201d.</p><p>\u201cFair point love.\u201d he sighed as he hung his head in defeat\u00a0\u201cMay I walk you back to your dorm than?\u201d.</p><p>You nodded and got to your feet as he stepped back\u00a0\u201cI\u2019d like that.\u201d.</p><p><b>\u00a0We clicked like legos, or the clacking of tap shoes</b></p><p>The following morning Sirius was yet again waiting for you at the bottom of the stairs, a smile on his face as you finally appeared</p><p><b>\u201cHey.\u201d </b>he said taking one of you hands in his<br></p><p><b>\u201cHello, how was your day?\u201d</b> you asked glancing to your joined hands.<br></p><p><b>\u201cBetter now.\u201d</b> he replied still smiling as he kissed you hand.<br></p><p><b>What a clich\u00e9, but to be honest it made my day.</b></p><p>The two of you walks around hogsmeade taking in the scene whilst stopping in at places like Honeydukes to get treats and The three broomsticks for a hot butterbeer to warm up from the cold.</p><p>\u201cWarm enough love?\u201d Sirius asked as he noticed you pulling your coat closer to yourself.<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m alright.\u201d you replied as you sipped your butterbeer\u00a0\u201cI forgot how cold it is here in the winter is all.\u201d.<br></p><p>Chuckling he wrapped an arm around you as he pulled you closer\u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s what winter does.\u201d he said pressing a kiss to your temple.</p><p>\u201cOh shush, it\u2019s not my fault I get cold easily.\u201d you huffed.<br></p><p>\u201cThan it\u2019s a good thing you have a boyfriend whose a walking heater.\u201d<br></p><p>Boyfriend, the word echoed in your head causing your heart to beat faster. Sirius Black was your boyfriend now.</p><p><b>I didn\u2019t wanna fall, but then I stepped right in. I looked up at your face and those eyes they drew me in</b></p><p>You had almost forgotten how beautiful Sirius\u2019s eyes were as you looked up at him, his face so close to yours that you could feel his hot breath on your neck. He leaned in closer, his nose now brushing yours and making it hard for you to breathe normally</p><p>\u201cSiri-\u201d you began, but were cut off my his lips softly crashing into your in a shy yet passionate kiss<br></p><p><b>It was too late for me</b></p><p>When he pulled away he rested his forehead on yours, his gray eyes never leaving your (E/C) ones \u201cFirst kiss?\u201d he asked.</p><p>You nodded as your fingers absentmindedly brushed over your lips\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m glad it was with you though.\u201d.</p><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d he smirked and leaned in kissing you again though this time with a slight bit more force and greed attached, though you were more than happy to oblige to any type of kisses from him.<br></p><p>He was your first love and it seemed you were his</p><p><b>That\u2019s what we were, a simple clich\u00e9, it wasn\u2019t made to work, but I wouldn\u2019t have it any other way (any other way).</b></p><p>Time passed and it became well known that you were Sirius\u2019s and that he was yours, though that didn\u2019t seem to stop girls from trying to steal him from you, not that you could blame them really, he was Sirius Black after all, but as Sirius told them countless times, he was yours and only yours no matter what happened in the end</p><p>Sixth year was finally here and you sat in your compartment quietly reading, Lily had left to find the restroom which left you waiting for the others and as per usual the marauders all arrived together, Sirius making a b line for you before pulling you into a tight hug and pressing kissed all over your face causing you to giggle</p><p>\u201cI missed you so much.\u201d he said sitting down with you in his lap.<br></p><p>\u201cI missed you too Siri.\u2019 you smiled kissing his cheek<br></p><p>Lily walked in to see this and gave a awe while James and the other look repulsed</p><p><b>You were so witty, and so charming, you swept me of my feet.

Moving over to the empty couch you sat and allowed yourself to sink into it&rsquo;s comfort after a long day of classes, with O.W.L&rsquo;s coming up fast you felt as if you barely had time to breathe with all the homework the professors were cramming down your throats, not to mention you felt like Lily, your best friend, was going to make you study to death.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey (L/N)&rdquo; A familiar voice called out to you.</p><p><b>You looked me in the eye and I wanted to erase myself (erase myself)</b></p><p>Glancing over your (e/c) eyes were met with stormy gray ones, the eyes that belonged to the famous Sirius Black, fellow fifth year and flirt extraordinaire, you&rsquo;d be lying if you said you didn&rsquo;t find him attractive. However, except for when Lily was around, you rarely spoke to the marauders so this situation caused you to internally panic and wish you had just went up to your dorm.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes Sirius?&rdquo; You asked politely trying to keep your nerves from showing through.</p><p>A playful smirk danced across his lips which enhanced his handsome features, you felt as if your heart was beating faster from it alone.</p><p>&ldquo;Strawberries or blueberries?&rdquo; he asked.<br /></p><p>You blinked in confusion as your eyebrows knitted together to physically illustrate your emotion&nbsp;&ldquo;Excuse me?&rdquo;.</p><p>He chuckled&nbsp;&ldquo;Which do you prefer?&rdquo;.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh uhm..&rdquo; you paused as you chewed your bottom lip in thought&nbsp;&ldquo;I guess i&rsquo;d have to say strawberries.&rdquo;.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a romantic than huh?&rdquo; James asked looking over to you.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how that makes me a romantic Potter.&rdquo; you snorted.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Ouch, why does Padfoot get the first name treatment and not me?&rdquo; he pouted<br /></p><p><b>I didn&rsquo;t wanna fall, but then I stepped right in</b></p><p>&ldquo;I like him better.&rdquo; you joked laughing a bit as you got to your feet.<br /></p><p>Unknowing to you, when you said that Sirius had felt his heart skip a beat.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m heading up to my dorm, try not to stay up too late boys.&rdquo; you waves a hand as you moved towards the stairs to the girls dormitory.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Yes Mother.&rdquo; James called after you.<br /></p><p>You listened as the other three boys laughed before shaking your head and heading up, they were immature sure, but they were entertaining.</p><p>Stepping into your dorm you noticed Lily absorbed in her studies per usual, quills and parchment scattered around her as she was pouring over her transfiguration textbook.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t bother trying to talk to her.&rdquo; One of your other friends, Marlene said from her four poster&nbsp;&ldquo;She hasn&rsquo;t moved since you guys got back from the library.&rdquo;.<br /></p><p>Sighing you snatched the book from the red heads hands before holding it out of reach when she tried to grab it&nbsp;&ldquo;Lils&rsquo; you need to rest, your brain is going to be mush if you don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p><p>Lily pouted as she held out her hand to you&nbsp;&ldquo;Give it back, I just have one more chapter left to go over.&rdquo;.</p><p>&ldquo;A chapter that will turn into the rest of the text book?&rdquo; you asked as you crossed you arms.<br /></p><p>Groaning in defeat your best friend gathered her things before putting them away&nbsp;&ldquo;Fine, only because I know you&rsquo;re right.&rdquo;.</p><p>&ldquo;When am I not?&rdquo; you grinned finally handing the book back.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t push it.&rdquo; Lily laughed.<br /></p><p><b>I looked down at the ground and I felt it right within</b></p><p>&ldquo;Where have you been anyway?&rdquo; Alice, another friend of yours asked sleepily.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;The couch looked comfy.&rdquo; you shrugged as you sat down on your own bed glancing down at your shoes.</p><p>&ldquo;Did something happen?&rdquo; Lily asked looking to you.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Huh?&rdquo; you glanced up once more not realizing the blush that had spread on your cheeks.<br /></p><p>The three girls ooh&rsquo;d at you and you suddenly felt the burning heat in your face&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Details.&rdquo; Marlene demanded as the three girls moved closer to you.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;N-Nothing happened!

Had Sirius Black just asked you on a date? No, no he had to mean it as friend surely.</p><p>&ldquo;Are James and the others coming too?&rdquo; you asked adjusting your bag.</p><p>&ldquo;No, just us, a date would be awkward with them along for the ride.&rdquo; he smirked<br /></p><p><b>I just stared and you grinned and looked right back, it felt like just one big whirlwind.</b></p><p>&ldquo;A-Alright than.&rdquo; you managed still completely caught off guard.<br /></p><p>He took your hand and placed a kiss on it&rsquo;s back&nbsp;&ldquo;See you in potions (L/N).&rdquo; and he was gone.</p><p>You continued to stand there in shock until Lily shook you and brought you back to earth</p><p><b>One big emotional whirlwind.</b></p><p>&ldquo;Are you alright (Y/N)?&rdquo; Lily asked as you looked to her&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been trying to get your attention for like five minutes now.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I..&rdquo; you finally spoke&nbsp;&ldquo;I have a date with Sirius this weekend?&rdquo; you said still unsure whether if this was real or not<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Wait what?!&rdquo; Marlene said a she joined the two of you.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;(Y/N) has a date with Black.&rdquo; Lily smirked looking to your friend.<br /></p><p>Marlene wiggled her eyebrows as she walked past the two of you humming about how you and Sirius were sitting in a tree soon to be k-i-s-s-i-n-g</p><p>&ldquo;Marlene!&rdquo; You whined chasing after her as a laughing Lily followed you guys to the great hall for breakfast.<br /></p><p><b>Over the next few days we got to talking, with every single word I started falling</b></p><p>You sat in the common room laughing quietly to yourself from behind your book as you listened to James try to persuade Lily into a date for the third time that day</p><p>&ldquo;Not in this lifetime Potter.&rdquo; Lily said as she turned a page in her own book.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Then in the next perhaps.&rdquo; James seemed to purr<br /></p><p>You snorted as you brought your book closer to yourself to avoid Lily&rsquo;s glare</p><p>&ldquo;Since when do you purr Prongs?&rdquo; Sirius asked from beside his best friend.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Hard not to when talking to someone as purr-fect as Evans.&rdquo; James winked and the sound of Lily&rsquo;s gag made you lose it as you completely buried your face in you book<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Someone is giggly today.&rdquo; Sirius smiled removing the book from your face.<br /></p><p>You were still laughing as you smiled up at me&nbsp;&ldquo;Hard not to laugh when Potter&rsquo;s pick up lines keep getting worse.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not a bad as Peter&rsquo;s jokes.&rdquo; Remus said as he walked through the portrait hole with Peter himself in tow.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Hey!&rdquo; Peter huffed which earned a laugh from the five of you&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Sirius took the empty seat on the couch beside you and leaned closer&nbsp;&ldquo;Not a fan of pick up lines?&rdquo; he whispered.</p><p>Fighting back a blush you glanced to him&nbsp;&ldquo;Depends who is saying them.&rdquo;</p><p>His usual smirk seemed to ooze cockiness&nbsp;&ldquo;And if they were from me?&rdquo;</p><p><b>Farther, farther, and farther for you</b></p><p>&ldquo;Then I might just like them.&rdquo; you admitted&nbsp;<br /></p><p>He gently tucked your (H/C) locks behind your ear&nbsp;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good to hear.&rdquo;</p><p>A clearing of the throat snapped both of your attentions back to James&nbsp;&ldquo;No flirting while i&rsquo;m trying to woo my future wife Padfoot.&rdquo;.</p><p>Lily rolled her eyes and grabbed your arm&nbsp;&ldquo;Come on (Y/N) we&rsquo;ll just study in the dorm.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh uhm, alright.&rdquo; you glanced to Sirius feeling a bit sad before grabbing your book and following her&nbsp;&ldquo;See you later guys.&rdquo;.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Not if we see you first.&rdquo; Peter called to you and his three friends groaned.<br /></p><p><b>You were so witty, and so charming, you swept me of my feet</b></p><p>However Sirius did up seeing you first, he had snuck down to the kitchen for a midnight snack to see you had done the same, your back to him as you talked to one of the house elves.</p><p>Smirking he quietly moved behind you and pulled you into a backwards hug&nbsp;&ldquo;Boo!&rdquo;.</p><p>You nearly jumped out of your skin as you spun around quickly to see who had scared you&nbsp;&ldquo;Sirius!&rdquo; you whisper yelled.</p><p>He chuckled&nbsp;&ldquo;Surprised to see me?&rdquo;.</p><p>You nodded&nbsp;&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t be though, even the house elves thought it was you sneaking in when I first arrived.&rdquo;.</p><p>He chuckled as he still held onto you close to him &ldquo;yeah I suppose I have a reputation.&rdquo;.</p><p>Reputation, the word that hung in your head every time you longed to get closer to Sirius, the word that kept you from admitting just how you felt about the messy haired Gryfindor who was currently holding you in his arms.</p><p>You gently pushed away from him and walked over to a counter hoisting yourself to sit on it&nbsp;&ldquo;Getting a snack?&rdquo;.</p><p>He nodded as he grabbed a pumpkin pastie and leaned against the counter beside you&nbsp;&ldquo;Are we still on for Hogsmeade tomorrow?&rdquo; he asked after swallowing the bite he had taken.</p><p>Nodding you sipped your tea&nbsp;&ldquo;Did you think i&rsquo;d chicken out?&rdquo; you joked.</p><p>Sirius chuckled&nbsp;&ldquo;To be honest I was surprised you agreed, seeing as we rarely talked before, though to be honest i&rsquo;ve always been curious about you.&rdquo; his smirked turned into a small smile as he looked to you.</p><p>You blushed softly&nbsp;&ldquo;Sirius Black interested in little old me?&rdquo; you laughed a bit&nbsp;&ldquo;Why is that?.</p><p>&ldquo;Well.&rdquo; he moved so he was in front of you, putting his arms on either side of you as he trapped you in your spot&nbsp;&ldquo;I remember in first year you got lost, but you were too stubborn to ask for directions so, you pressed on and ended up walking into potions with five minutes to spare.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Your whole face turned red&nbsp;&ldquo;Gee what other embarrassing thing do you remember?&rdquo; you snarked glancing to the side.</p><p>He chuckled&nbsp;&ldquo;In third year on our first hogsmeade trip I remember Remus was low on funds so you paid for the rest of his honeydukes for him.&rdquo;.</p><p>&ldquo;Well that&rsquo;s-&rdquo; he held up a finger stopping you.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Fourth year you stood up for a first year who was being bullied despite the fact that I can tell you hate confrontation.&rdquo; he continued.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;What are you getting at?&rdquo; You finally asked.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;(L/N) you are the most amazing girl i&rsquo;ve ever met let alone get the honor of being friends with, You&rsquo;re stubborn sure, but you&rsquo;re also determined, caring, sweet, compassionate&hellip;You&rsquo;re amazing (F/N) and I love you.&rdquo; he admitted glancing away slightly, a light blush on his cheeks.<br /></p><p>You were shocked into silence once again thanks to Sirius, you opened your mouth to speak, but no words came out so you closed it whilst feeling your face heat up so hot you thought it was gonna melt off.</p><p><b>You made me laugh, you made me blush, no one could compete (no one could compete)</b></p><p>&ldquo;I-I love you too Sirius.&rdquo; you finally managed after about a minute.<br /></p><p>He looked back to you as a wide smile spread across his face&nbsp;&ldquo;Really?&rdquo;.</p><p>You couldn&rsquo;t help the laugh that escaped his lips, if you didn&rsquo;t know any better you would think he was wagging the tail he didn&rsquo;t have&nbsp;&ldquo;Of course, I have no reason to lie.&rdquo;.</p><p>Pulling you into a tight hug Sirius pressed a kiss to forehead&nbsp;&ldquo;You have no idea how long i&rsquo;ve waited to hear you say that?&rdquo; he mumbled into your hair.</p><p>&ldquo;How long?&rdquo; you asked as your head rested on his chest, the beating of his heart soothing you.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been in love with you since that day you walked into potions late during first year and asked Slughorn why on earth Hogwarts had a dungeon.&rdquo; he snorted at the memory.<br /></p><p><b>It seemed to good to be true (It seemed to good to be true.)</b></p><p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo; you asked surprised<br /></p><p>He nodded&nbsp;&ldquo;What about you? How long have you been in love with me? Since puberty?&rdquo;.</p><p><b>I wanted to be with you (only with you)</b></p><p>You shook your head&nbsp;&ldquo;Second year actually, we were in transfiguration and another Gryffindor was having trouble and while McGonagall wasn&rsquo;t watching you helped them out.&rdquo; you smiled at the cute memory.</p><p>He blushed softly&nbsp;&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t think anyone had seen that.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find i&rsquo;m very observant.&rdquo; you giggled and heard the clock chime&nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s getting late, we should both get to bed.&rdquo;</p><p>He pouted&nbsp;&ldquo;I wanna be with you though.&rdquo;</p><p>Your heart skipped a beat as you gave him a small smile&nbsp;&ldquo;Well if we go to sleep, the sooner tomorrow comes for our date right?&rdquo;.</p><p>&ldquo;Fair point love.&rdquo; he sighed as he hung his head in defeat&nbsp;&ldquo;May I walk you back to your dorm than?&rdquo;.</p><p>You nodded and got to your feet as he stepped back&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like that.&rdquo;.</p><p><b>&nbsp;We clicked like legos, or the clacking of tap shoes</b></p><p>The following morning Sirius was yet again waiting for you at the bottom of the stairs, a smile on his face as you finally appeared</p><p><b>&ldquo;Hey.&rdquo; </b>he said taking one of you hands in his<br /></p><p><b>&ldquo;Hello, how was your day?&rdquo;</b> you asked glancing to your joined hands.<br /></p><p><b>&ldquo;Better now.&rdquo;</b> he replied still smiling as he kissed you hand.<br /></p><p><b>What a clich&eacute;, but to be honest it made my day.</b></p><p>The two of you walks around hogsmeade taking in the scene whilst stopping in at places like Honeydukes to get treats and The three broomsticks for a hot butterbeer to warm up from the cold.</p><p>&ldquo;Warm enough love?&rdquo; Sirius asked as he noticed you pulling your coat closer to yourself.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m alright.&rdquo; you replied as you sipped your butterbeer&nbsp;&ldquo;I forgot how cold it is here in the winter is all.&rdquo;.<br /></p><p>Chuckling he wrapped an arm around you as he pulled you closer&nbsp;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what winter does.&rdquo; he said pressing a kiss to your temple.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh shush, it&rsquo;s not my fault I get cold easily.&rdquo; you huffed.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Than it&rsquo;s a good thing you have a boyfriend whose a walking heater.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Boyfriend, the word echoed in your head causing your heart to beat faster. Sirius Black was your boyfriend now.</p><p><b>I didn&rsquo;t wanna fall, but then I stepped right in. I looked up at your face and those eyes they drew me in</b></p><p>You had almost forgotten how beautiful Sirius&rsquo;s eyes were as you looked up at him, his face so close to yours that you could feel his hot breath on your neck. He leaned in closer, his nose now brushing yours and making it hard for you to breathe normally</p><p>&ldquo;Siri-&rdquo; you began, but were cut off my his lips softly crashing into your in a shy yet passionate kiss<br /></p><p><b>It was too late for me</b></p><p>When he pulled away he rested his forehead on yours, his gray eyes never leaving your (E/C) ones &ldquo;First kiss?&rdquo; he asked.</p><p>You nodded as your fingers absentmindedly brushed over your lips&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad it was with you though.&rdquo;.</p><p>&ldquo;Me too.&rdquo; he smirked and leaned in kissing you again though this time with a slight bit more force and greed attached, though you were more than happy to oblige to any type of kisses from him.<br /></p><p>He was your first love and it seemed you were his</p><p><b>That&rsquo;s what we were, a simple clich&eacute;, it wasn&rsquo;t made to work, but I wouldn&rsquo;t have it any other way (any other way).</b></p><p>Time passed and it became well known that you were Sirius&rsquo;s and that he was yours, though that didn&rsquo;t seem to stop girls from trying to steal him from you, not that you could blame them really, he was Sirius Black after all, but as Sirius told them countless times, he was yours and only yours no matter what happened in the end</p><p>Sixth year was finally here and you sat in your compartment quietly reading, Lily had left to find the restroom which left you waiting for the others and as per usual the marauders all arrived together, Sirius making a b line for you before pulling you into a tight hug and pressing kissed all over your face causing you to giggle</p><p>&ldquo;I missed you so much.&rdquo; he said sitting down with you in his lap.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I missed you too Siri.&rsquo; you smiled kissing his cheek<br /></p><p>Lily walked in to see this and gave a awe while James and the other look repulsed</p><p><b>You were so witty, and so charming, you swept me of my feet.
