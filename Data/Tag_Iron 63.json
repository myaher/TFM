        "body": "<p>\n\n<b><i>Warning: this story is based heavily around suicide, including suicidal thoughts and attempts. Please be careful!! &lt;3</i></b>\n\n<br/></p><hr><p>Peter made his way through the school day like a ghost, the morning\u2019s conversation playing in his mind on repeat.</p><p><i>If you died, you know I would follow</i>.</p><p>The comment sat heavy in Peter\u2019s mind like a rock, weighing him down, affecting every aspect of that day.</p><!-- more --><p>When he was called on to answer a question in class, got it wrong, and starting mentally torturing himself, he froze and thought, <i>Don\u2019t do this to Mr. Stark</i>.</p><p>When an event that triggered his anxiety caused him to dig his fingers into his palms, he imagined the same crescents mirrored on Tony\u2019s scarred hands, and he stopped himself pretty fast.</p><p>When the self-deprecating thoughts invaded his head every half hour like clockwork, when they got too loud and the thought to take action unsurprisingly brought every other thought to a halt, Peter had to stop himself and <i>breathe </i>until he regained at least partial sanity. Because whatever method he debated using - jumping off a bridge, drowning himself in a river - he imagined the same thing happening to Mr. Stark, to his <i>dad</i>, and that thought in itself brought bouts of panic.</p><p>He understood what Mr. Stark was trying to say. If Peter put himself in harm\u2019s way, Tony wouldn\u2019t follow long after. If it was supposed to bring Peter comfort, or a sense of support, or what, he didn\u2019t know - because all he felt when he thought of Mr. Stark\u2019s body lying mangled on a block of pavement, or being pulled, bruised and blue, from a river, all Peter felt was intense <i>guilt</i>.</p><p>Maybe Tony thought that would make Peter stop, rethink his choices, realize he had people in his corner - but instead, it just made Peter want to end it all even <i>more</i>. If he was letting down Tony so much, why should he still burden him? But that just caused the guilt to grow even <i>stronger</i>, and by the time the final dismissal bell rang, Peter was in a vicious cycle of guilt and pain.</p><p>For a minute, he was excited to sprint out the doors and into Tony\u2019s waiting car, to rid himself of the dark thoughts crowding his own mind, but today he had to stop himself, realizing Tony was the <i>cause </i>of this.</p><p>Peter momentarily debated telling Tony a surprise Decathlon meeting had been called and he had to stay late - or maybe he could say he was doing homework in the library.</p><p>His heart sank to his shoes when he realized he was a <i>terrible </i>liar and Tony would easily see through him.</p><p>He stopped at his locker and tried to take as long as possible to pack his bag, debating whether or not to take home his math textbook even though he had finished all his work during the day, just for an excuse to retire to his room; though, he guessed Tony would just follow him.</p><p>Sighing, he slammed his locker shut and slouched his way out the door, immediately finding the white Audi in the parking lot. (It wasn\u2019t hard - by the time Peter left the school, most of the other cars had already pulled away.) He plastered on a smile as he pulled open the back door and climbed in, hoping to avoid an awkward conversation by getting into the passenger seat. The judgemental look Tony shot him told him that was the wrong choice.</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019d you get in the back?\u201d</p><p>Peter stared back, trying to look innocent.</p><p>\u201cThe door was closer than walking all the way around.\u201d</p><p>Tony looked unconvinced. \u201cKid, I showered this morning. I don\u2019t smell.\u201d</p><p>Peter chuckled as if he was making a harmless joke and looked out the window, praying Tony would just drop it and drive away. He should\u2019ve known he was too stubborn.</p><p>\u201cGet in the front, Pete.\u201d</p><p>Peter was surprised at how much his heartbeat increased as he reshouldered his backpack, got out of the car, climbed into the passenger seat, and buckled up his seatbelt, all the while refusing to look at Tony - meaning he didn\u2019t see the man take off his sunglasses in order to look at Peter without anything between them.</p><p>After a minute of silence and Peter looking dutifully out the window, Tony finally sighed, turned the key in the ignition, and began the fifteen-minute drive back to the tower.</p><p>\u201cHow was school today?\u201d he asked nonchalantly as he turned out of the parking lot. Peter continued to stare out the window at his classmates in passing cars.</p><p><i>I bet none of them are depressed.</i></p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>Tony had to keep his head from whipping around to stare at the kid. <i>Was that a one-word answer? </i>Suddenly, Tony realized he had been getting a lot of one-word answers from Peter lately. He just wasn\u2019t the talkative kid he used to be. Again, Tony wondered how he could\u2019ve been so ignorant not to notice the signs, the calls for help.</p><p>\u201cDo anything different today? Learn anything cool?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really.\u201d</p><p>Another look at the kid showed him practically pressed against the door, his face fully turned towards the window, his head back against the seat as if he was too tired to hold it up, and it was just too heavy - which, Tony realized with a start, was probably <i>exactly </i>how it felt.</p><p>Tony sighed at the lack of a response. \u201cListen, kid, we have fifteen minutes in this car together, so why don\u2019t you just tell me what\u2019s up and we can avoid making this more awkward than it has to be?\u201d</p><p>Peter shut his eyes momentarily, wincing against the harshness in his voice, but turned his head from the window to meet Tony\u2019s expectant gaze, albeit hesitantly.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know what I have to say won\u2019t make it more awkward?\u201d</p><p>Tony turned his attention back to the windshield, trying not to let it show how much that comment bothered him.</p><p>\u201cTry me.\u201d</p><p>Peter sighed in frustration.</p><p>\u201cI already know the worst of it, kid,\u201d Tony continued at the noise, hoping, praying, that the statement was true - that there were no other horrors Peter had been hiding, shouldering on his own. \u201cYou might as well just let the rest out.\u201d</p><p>Peter knew Tony was right. He knew what he had been keeping inside wasn\u2019t necessarily <i>worse </i>- but he also knew it wasn\u2019t quite <i>better</i>, either. Nevertheless, Tony was waiting on an answer, so an answer, Peter would give.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like that you\u2019re managing me so closely,\u201d he whispered, scared to speak any louder, but Tony cleared his throat.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t hear you, bud, you\u2019re gonna half to speak up-\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>I don\u2019t like that you\u2019re managing me so closely</i>,\u201d he repeated louder, just a notch below shouting, causing Tony\u2019s eyebrows to raise significantly as his hands clenched tighter around the wheel.</p><p>Peter wanted to feel embarrassed at his sudden outburst. Any other day, he would\u2019ve been. But it felt <i>so good </i>to get this tightness out of his chest, to dislodge the heavy stone that had been weighing him down since - well, he couldn\u2019t even remember when.</p><p>All that he <i>did </i>know was that it felt <i>so good </i>to yell.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t let me leave your sight last night. You asked F.R.I.D.A.Y. to <i>lock the windows </i>when I went to the bathroom! I know my way to the living room, Tony!\u201d</p><p>Tony\u2019s eyebrow was cocked, his mouth set in a firm line.</p><p>Peter was crossing the line. He <i>knew </i>he was. He knew he sounded nothing like himself, and he knew how disrespectful he was being. He was <i>definitely </i>going to pay for it later.</p><p>Right now, though, he was <i>finally </i>getting it off his chest. He was <i>finally </i>telling someone. Even if that someone would probably get his own two cents in once Peter was done, he was finally <i>talking</i>.</p><p>And it felt <i>good</i>.</p><p>\u201cYou wanted to keep me in my room this morning, and you hid the knives from me! <i>Gosh</i>, Tony, I\u2019m not a child!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was trying to keep you <i>safe</i>.\u201d</p><p>Tony\u2019s voice was surprisingly calm, but Peter had heard it used at enough press events to know what it meant. What it came off as was \u2018I\u2019m going to cooly answer your rude question.\u2019 What it <i>meant </i>was \u2018Keep talking and soon you won\u2019t be able to.\u2019</p><p>But Peter wasn\u2019t done yet.</p><p>\u201cI told you what I was feeling.\u201d His voice was quieter now, though not controlled - more, <i>yelling is exhausting but I\u2019m still pissed</i>. \u201cI was <i>honest </i>with you. I was honest for the first time in three years in hopes that you would help me, and maybe be more compassionate, but instead you\u2019re treating me like - like a prisoner! And you - you realize that all this guilt-tripping stuff, it\u2019s just making it worse, right? It just makes me want to die <i>more </i>but I can\u2019t and I get that\u2019s what you were trying to do but now I\u2019m <i>miserable</i> and <i>gosh</i>, I just want to throw myself off a bridge right now-\u201d</p><p>Peter cut himself off at the sudden honesty.</p><p>He had never - he had never said that <i>out loud</i> before, and saying it out loud made it real-</p><p>but it didn\u2019t make it less true.</p><p>Suddenly, Tony was pulling off the road into a gas station parking lot. He parked the car before turning completely in his chair to look at Peter, who stared back, self-conscious.</p><p>\u201cThree years?\u201d he repeated quietly, hurt clear in his eyes so intense Peter couldn\u2019t keep eye contact. Instead, he looked down to where his hands were fiddling in his lap and nodded solemnly.</p><p>\u201cSince I was thirteen,\u201d he mumbled. \u201cSeventh grade.\u201d</p><p>Before he knew it, Tony was unbuckling his seatbelt and leaning forwards across the center console to pull Peter into a tight hug. Peter tensed at the sudden contact after being so- so <i>disrespectful</i>, but tentatively leaned into it, before thinking, <i>Screw it</i>, and wrapping his arms just as tight around his dad.</p><p>He knew the feeling of the console jutting into Tony\u2019s stomach couldn\u2019t have felt comfortable, but he guessed the feeling of his kid in his arms more than made up for it.</p><p>Suddenly, Peter realized he was <i>crying</i>, the feeling of being held so tightly, surrounded by so much <i>love </i>after feeling undeserving, unlovable, causing all his walls to crumble. Tony\u2019s hand found its way into Peter\u2019s curls, and though he did it often Peter knew he would <i>never </i>get tired of it, melting into the touch.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Tony mumbled, kissing his kid\u2019s head before resting his chin atop it. \u201cI was scared. Peter, I was <i>so </i>scared. I didn\u2019t know what to do. I didn\u2019t want to lose you.\u201d</p><p>Peter was going to respond with <i>I\u2019m not going anywhere</i>, but realized they had already distinguished that as a lie. He stayed quiet instead, breathing in the faint scent of motor oil and pine-scented car freshener. The smells of safety; the smells of <i>home</i>.</p><p>After a moment of comfortable silence, Peter stuttered out a quick, \u201cDid you put your tracker in my watch?\u201d</p><p>Tony stilled. \u201cHow\u2019d you know?\u201d</p><p>Peter laughed lightly as he detangled himself from Tony\u2019s grasp. \u201cIt was heavier than usual.\u201d</p><p>Tony sighed, feigning frustration. \u201cOf course you would notice.\u201d</p><p>The silence returned, but this time it wasn\u2019t so comfortable. The jokes were over - both could tell - and now it was time for the more\u2026 <i>serious </i>side of things.</p><p>\u201cJust, don\u2019t treat me like a prisoner,\u201d Peter said seriously. \u201cI just need - gosh, I feel like a child asking for this - I just need support sometimes, and someone to talk to, <i>without </i>judgement, when it gets hard.\u201d</p><p>Tony nodded eagerly. \u201cKid, you <i>always </i>had that. I thought you knew that.\u201d</p><p>Peter shrugged, cheeks faintly flushed, avoiding eye contact.</p><p>\u201cIt - it was just hard to remember sometimes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, kid,\u201d Tony spoke softly, taking Peter\u2019s hand in his own and rubbing a gentle finger over his knuckles. \u201cI\u2019m always there for you. Don\u2019t you ever forget it.\u201d</p><p>Peter shot him a grateful smile, and waited for Tony to say what was clearly on his mind.</p><p>The older man cleared his throat, his eyes seeming to darken.</p><p>\u201cPeter, have you ever given a thought to\u2026 therapy?\u201d</p><p>Peter tensed at the word.</p><p>Truth was, he <i>had </i>thought about it. He knew this whole <i>depression </i>thing was taking over his life, ruining everything - affecting every decision, his very <i>future</i>.</p><p>Some days, he thought seeing a therapist wasn\u2019t the worst idea. Maybe they <i>could </i>help. Maybe he could start <i>living </i>again.</p><p>Others, it seemed like the Worst Possible Thing. He was too far past saving. Nothing could be done. Plus, seeing a therapist was <i>so </i>expensive - what if Tony finally realized Peter wasn\u2019t worth it? And also, if that wasn\u2019t enough, who knew if he\u2019d even be able to <i>speak </i>to a therapist?</p><p><i>What\u2019s bothering you?</i></p><p><i>I\u2019m depressed, but not depressed-depressed, because sometimes I\u2019m really sad and other times I\u2019m not, and I have no reason to be so I guess it\u2019s not really true. And also, I\u2019m Spiderman, which I\u2019m not supposed to tell you, and I see civilians die, like, once a week, maybe? Also, my Uncle Ben died in front of my eyes when I was younger, my parents even before that, but I got used to it and I was fine until my Aunt died too. I was trapped under a building, my crush\u2019s dad tried to kill me, and also I\u2019m shoved against lockers every day by bullies because I\u2019m only a high school freshman. What\u2019s up with you?</i></p><p>Yeah, that would go over well.</p><p>\u201cAny thoughts?\u201d</p><p><i>Oh</i>, Peter realized with a start. Tony was still waiting on an answer.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, Mr. Stark,\u201d he said quietly, embarrassed. \u201cI mean, other people have it worse than me, right? Why would someone waste their time talking to me, a sort-of-sad-but-maybe-it\u2019s-just-teen-angst kid, when they could be helping someone who <i>really </i>needs it?\u201d</p><p>Tony shot him a look that Peter recognized as something close to pity, but not quite.</p><p>\u201cPeter, you have <i>got </i>to give yourself credit sometimes. You almost-\u201d He had to stop himself. Breathe. Compose. Try again. \u201cYou almost <i>killed </i>yourself, Peter. You deserve to get help. And even if you didn\u2019t, even if things had never gotten that extreme - damn it, Peter, you <i>deserve </i>to feel better. You don\u2019t deserve to feel anything less than perfect!\u201d</p><p>The tone of his voice didn\u2019t match the passionate fire of his words. It was sad, upset, ready to be overcome with tears at any given moment.</p><p>\u201cPlease, Peter, let me help you.\u201d</p><p>Peter let out a dejected sigh.</p><p>\u201cFor the record, I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll help.\u201d</p><p>Tony didn\u2019t say anything.</p><p>\u201cAnd I really don\u2019t deserve it.\u201d</p><p>He looked like he wanted to interrupt, but was biting his tongue.</p><p>\u201cAnd it\u2019s really expensive-\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about the money!\u201d he finally blurted, and Peter chuckled inwardly. Of course that was the one trigger, the one thing Tony spoke out on, that he made sure wasn\u2019t an issue - the one thing he had easy control over.</p><p>With one final, heavy sigh, Peter closed his eyes, sure he was going to regret what he said.</p><p>\u201cFine. I\u2019ll go to therapy.\u201d</p><p>His sinking heart was immediately lifted when he heard the - the <i>giggle </i>from\u2026 <i>Tony Stark</i>?</p><p>\u201cDid you just-\u201d he let his eyes flutter open for emphasis- \u201c<i>giggle</i>?\u201d</p><p>Tony clamped a hand over his widely-grinning mouth.</p><p>\u201cDid I just win an argument against the most stubborn kid in the world?\u201d</p><p>Peter rolled his eyes. <i>Gosh</i>, his dad was a dork. He was going to be stuck with him forever, wasn\u2019t he?</p><p>Peter opened his arms once more, and the two collapsed into a hug of comfort, and protection - of safety, and love.</p><p>Of family.</p><p>\u29df<b> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</b><i>One week later \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</i>\u29df</p><p>As the car pulled up outside of the modest-looking two storey, Peter wanted nothing more than to sink down into his seat and never resurface.</p><p>The first day of therapy.</p><p>He\u2019d be lying if he said a small, miniscule part of him wasn\u2019t excited. It was a chance to heal himself, restore him to what he used to be.</p><p>But a (much) larger part of himself was <i>terrified</i>.</p><p>What if the therapist knocked down a wall Peter forgot he had up? Brought forward some terrible memories that just made this whole <i>life </i>thing worse?</p><p>Peter had finally gotten semi-control over himself - what if all his progress was ruined for Tony\u2019s want for Peter\u2019s recovery to be professional?</p><p>\u201cI mean, what qualifies someone as a professional, anyways?\u201d Peter continued the argument aloud as Tony started exiting the car. Peter stayed put. \u201cShouldn\u2019t <i>I </i>be trusted to heal <i>myself</i>? I mean, I know me best. She doesn\u2019t know anything about me.\u201d Tony had prepped Peter on the way over. His therapist was someone Tony had found after hours of thorough Google searches - someone named Adrienne.</p><p>Tony just rolled his eyes and said a quick, \u201cCome on, Spiderbaby. Get out of the car,\u201d before slamming the door and crossing his arms and tapping his foot, acting impatient. (Peter knew Tony really had all the time in the world for him.)</p><p>Peter sighed, getting out of the car and closing the door behind him.</p><p>\u201cI mean, really,\u201d he tried one final attempt (though he knew it was futile) to derail Tony as he locked the door behind him and they began to ascend the few steps leading up to the house. \u201cI should be trusted to know myself!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe quiet and go talk about your feelings, and if I don\u2019t see any tears by the time I pick you up,\u201d Tony \u2018threatened\u2019 with gritted teeth, ringing the doorbell. He slung an arm around Peter\u2019s shoulders and shook him lightly, giving him a comforting smile before the door opened.</p><p>\u29df</p><p>Peter exited the house an hour later, looking surprisingly\u2026 unaffected. Tony was waiting for him in the car, typing away on his Starkpad, but he looked up at the first sign of movement, quickly exiting the car and skipping steps to reach where Peter was just stepping over the threshold, pulling the door shut behind him.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d it go, bud?\u201d he asked lightly, ruffling the kid\u2019s hair. Peter gently pushed his hand away, but Tony knew it was only because they were in public. He <i>loved </i>when Tony played with his hair.</p><p>\u201cActually\u2026 <i>okay</i>.\u201d Peter looked confused at the lack of horrible, life-changing events, and Tony finally allowed himself to smirk, knowing the kid couldn\u2019t see him.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t told a <i>complete </i>lie; he <i>had </i>spent hours searching online for the perfect therapist, but not for Peter, for <i>himself</i>, and not over the past week, either. Really, he had been going to Adrienne biweekly since New York (though Peter being younger would be going weekly). And she had been a <i>huge </i>help.</p><p>Tony wasn\u2019t really hiding it, per se; he just didn\u2019t feel like anyone needed to know. Maybe he\u2019d tell Peter later, but for now, he wanted Peter to think Tony was someone stable for him to lean on. (He didn\u2019t realize the thought of someone Peter trusted going through the same thing as him would help him come to terms with it - or maybe Tony did. Maybe Tony was scared to be open about his weaknesses, but really, who was to tell?)</p><p>\u201cWhat did you guys talk about? If you don\u2019t mind me asking,\u201d Tony asked as they reached the car, pulling the door open for Peter to climb in, before jogging to the other side to get in himself.</p><p>\u201cShe just asked me about what I liked to do and stuff. We talked about Brooklyn Nine-Nine for a solid 20 minutes. Turns out she likes the show, too.\u201d</p><p>Tony bit back his smile. During <i>his </i>first session, they had talked about cars. Adrienne had known a surprising amount - her niece was a mechanic, too, and taught her enough to keep up with everything Tony was talking about, which was no easy feat. That was when Tony knew she was perfect for him - and would be for Peter, too.</p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t do any actual <i>talking </i>stuff,\u201d Peter muttered, almost to himself, and Tony knew he was trying to figure out why. Was it a scheme, or was she actually just the fraud he had suspected?</p><p>The next week\u2019s session seemed to answer his question.</p><p>Tony immediately knew this night would be different from last week\u2019s when Peter slouched out of the house, eyes trained on the floor, feet dragging on the pavement. Tony was ready for him as soon as he came out.</p><p>\u201cA bit harder today?\u201d he asked quietly when they were safely inside the car, driving home. Peter nodded, but didn\u2019t say anything more. Tony let the answer they were both expecting hang in the air for a moment before voicing it.</p><p>\u201cWant to talk about it?\u201d</p><p>Peter shook his head, which Tony was expecting. Instead, he wrapped the kid in his fluffiest blanket as soon as the pair got home, and they fell asleep on the couch watching Brooklyn Nine-Nine reruns. They didn\u2019t talk about the sessions, or what Peter was thinking, and Tony didn\u2019t question it.</p><p>He knew Peter would come to him if there was something he wanted to say.</p><p>There was no telling what each session would bring. Some were better than others.</p><p>Some days, Peter came bounding down the stone steps, the living embodiment of sunshine.</p><p>Others, he barely had the strength to stagger down the stairs without collapsing. Tony would be there for him the entire way, supporting him without a question, knowing two bowls of ice cream and unlimited blankets were awaiting them at home.</p><p>Days, in general, were unpredictable. Tony could usually tell from the get-go what kind of day Peter was going to have. He was either smiling, or could barely get out of bed.</p><p>On the good days, Tony smiled back. Made him pancakes, ruffled his hair, did anything in his power to keep it that way.</p><p>On the bad days, Peter would barely have the strength to get out of bed - but Tony would never leave his side then, either. He would say encouraging words, help guide him out the door. Send him encouraging messages throughout the school day for the kid to read during lunch, or between periods. (Peter would be lying if he said they didn\u2019t help, even just a tad.)</p><p>But there were other days where Tony just couldn\u2019t tell.</p><p>Peter woke up wearing a smile that Tony saw straight through, feeling, for whatever reason, that he needed to mask what he was feeling. Tony would encourage him to open up, even offer to sign him out of school for the day if he was being relentless. Tony didn\u2019t want that wall coming down mid-school day and having Peter upset surrounded by his peers. He knew how difficult a bunch of pubescent kids could be.</p><p>Other days, Peter woke up one way and came home from school the other. It was always a pleasant surprise when he came home smiling after seeming so miserable just that morning; but at other times, if something had happened at school to tarnish Peter\u2019s positive morning attitude, Tony just held him close and promised him it would be okay.</p><p>It took a while for that promise to actually come to life.</p><p>Peter expected to feel better within the first few weeks of therapy. When he didn\u2019t, the month. Then, the season. And, upsettingly, he didn\u2019t even feel one hundred percent back by the end of the year.</p><p>But he <i>did </i>feel better.</p><p>The thoughts in Peter\u2019s mind weren\u2019t as dark as they once had been. He didn\u2019t associate a bridge with jumping, a body of water with drowning. An incorrect answer in school didn\u2019t start a whirlwind of negative thoughts.</p><p>Of course, there were still bad days where Peter woke up in the morning and just\u2026 didn\u2019t feel like moving. And it sucked. He knew that no matter what happened, no matter what Tony tried to do to help him (and he tried a lot), the day was just a waste.</p><p>But he went to bed, and woke up the next morning with a fresh new attitude, and hoped that this day would be better than the last.</p><p>Peter wasn\u2019t feeling perfect, but he was feeling better.</p><p>And maybe that was enough.</p>",

Because whatever method he debated using - jumping off a bridge, drowning himself in a river - he imagined the same thing happening to Mr. Stark, to his <i>dad</i>, and that thought in itself brought bouts of panic.</p><p>He understood what Mr. Stark was trying to say. If Peter put himself in harm\u2019s way, Tony wouldn\u2019t follow long after. If it was supposed to bring Peter comfort, or a sense of support, or what, he didn\u2019t know - because all he felt when he thought of Mr. Stark\u2019s body lying mangled on a block of pavement, or being pulled, bruised and blue, from a river, all Peter felt was intense <i>guilt</i>.</p><p>Maybe Tony thought that would make Peter stop, rethink his choices, realize he had people in his corner - but instead, it just made Peter want to end it all even <i>more</i>. If he was letting down Tony so much, why should he still burden him? But that just caused the guilt to grow even <i>stronger</i>, and by the time the final dismissal bell rang, Peter was in a vicious cycle of guilt and pain.</p><p>For a minute, he was excited to sprint out the doors and into Tony\u2019s waiting car, to rid himself of the dark thoughts crowding his own mind, but today he had to stop himself, realizing Tony was the <i>cause </i>of this.</p><p>Peter momentarily debated telling Tony a surprise Decathlon meeting had been called and he had to stay late - or maybe he could say he was doing homework in the library.</p><p>His heart sank to his shoes when he realized he was a <i>terrible </i>liar and Tony would easily see through him.</p><p>He stopped at his locker and tried to take as long as possible to pack his bag, debating whether or not to take home his math textbook even though he had finished all his work during the day, just for an excuse to retire to his room; though, he guessed Tony would just follow him.</p><p>Sighing, he slammed his locker shut and slouched his way out the door, immediately finding the white Audi in the parking lot. (It wasn\u2019t hard - by the time Peter left the school, most of the other cars had already pulled away.) He plastered on a smile as he pulled open the back door and climbed in, hoping to avoid an awkward conversation by getting into the passenger seat. The judgemental look Tony shot him told him that was the wrong choice.</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019d you get in the back?\u201d</p><p>Peter stared back, trying to look innocent.</p><p>\u201cThe door was closer than walking all the way around.\u201d</p><p>Tony looked unconvinced. \u201cKid, I showered this morning. I don\u2019t smell.\u201d</p><p>Peter chuckled as if he was making a harmless joke and looked out the window, praying Tony would just drop it and drive away. He should\u2019ve known he was too stubborn.</p><p>\u201cGet in the front, Pete.\u201d</p><p>Peter was surprised at how much his heartbeat increased as he reshouldered his backpack, got out of the car, climbed into the passenger seat, and buckled up his seatbelt, all the while refusing to look at Tony - meaning he didn\u2019t see the man take off his sunglasses in order to look at Peter without anything between them.</p><p>After a minute of silence and Peter looking dutifully out the window, Tony finally sighed, turned the key in the ignition, and began the fifteen-minute drive back to the tower.</p><p>\u201cHow was school today?\u201d he asked nonchalantly as he turned out of the parking lot. Peter continued to stare out the window at his classmates in passing cars.</p><p><i>I bet none of them are depressed.</i></p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>Tony had to keep his head from whipping around to stare at the kid. <i>Was that a one-word answer? </i>Suddenly, Tony realized he had been getting a lot of one-word answers from Peter lately. He just wasn\u2019t the talkative kid he used to be. Again, Tony wondered how he could\u2019ve been so ignorant not to notice the signs, the calls for help.</p><p>\u201cDo anything different today? Learn anything cool?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really.\u201d</p><p>Another look at the kid showed him practically pressed against the door, his face fully turned towards the window, his head back against the seat as if he was too tired to hold it up, and it was just too heavy - which, Tony realized with a start, was probably <i>exactly </i>how it felt.</p><p>Tony sighed at the lack of a response. \u201cListen, kid, we have fifteen minutes in this car together, so why don\u2019t you just tell me what\u2019s up and we can avoid making this more awkward than it has to be?\u201d</p><p>Peter shut his eyes momentarily, wincing against the harshness in his voice, but turned his head from the window to meet Tony\u2019s expectant gaze, albeit hesitantly.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know what I have to say won\u2019t make it more awkward?\u201d</p><p>Tony turned his attention back to the windshield, trying not to let it show how much that comment bothered him.</p><p>\u201cTry me.\u201d</p><p>Peter sighed in frustration.</p><p>\u201cI already know the worst of it, kid,\u201d Tony continued at the noise, hoping, praying, that the statement was true - that there were no other horrors Peter had been hiding, shouldering on his own. \u201cYou might as well just let the rest out.\u201d</p><p>Peter knew Tony was right. He knew what he had been keeping inside wasn\u2019t necessarily <i>worse </i>- but he also knew it wasn\u2019t quite <i>better</i>, either. Nevertheless, Tony was waiting on an answer, so an answer, Peter would give.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like that you\u2019re managing me so closely,\u201d he whispered, scared to speak any louder, but Tony cleared his throat.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t hear you, bud, you\u2019re gonna half to speak up-\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>I don\u2019t like that you\u2019re managing me so closely</i>,\u201d he repeated louder, just a notch below shouting, causing Tony\u2019s eyebrows to raise significantly as his hands clenched tighter around the wheel.</p><p>Peter wanted to feel embarrassed at his sudden outburst. Any other day, he would\u2019ve been. But it felt <i>so good </i>to get this tightness out of his chest, to dislodge the heavy stone that had been weighing him down since - well, he couldn\u2019t even remember when.</p><p>All that he <i>did </i>know was that it felt <i>so good </i>to yell.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t let me leave your sight last night. You asked F.R.I.D.A.Y. to <i>lock the windows </i>when I went to the bathroom! I know my way to the living room, Tony!\u201d</p><p>Tony\u2019s eyebrow was cocked, his mouth set in a firm line.</p><p>Peter was crossing the line. He <i>knew </i>he was. He knew he sounded nothing like himself, and he knew how disrespectful he was being. He was <i>definitely </i>going to pay for it later.</p><p>Right now, though, he was <i>finally </i>getting it off his chest. He was <i>finally </i>telling someone. Even if that someone would probably get his own two cents in once Peter was done, he was finally <i>talking</i>.</p><p>And it felt <i>good</i>.</p><p>\u201cYou wanted to keep me in my room this morning, and you hid the knives from me! <i>Gosh</i>, Tony, I\u2019m not a child!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was trying to keep you <i>safe</i>.\u201d</p><p>Tony\u2019s voice was surprisingly calm, but Peter had heard it used at enough press events to know what it meant. What it came off as was \u2018I\u2019m going to cooly answer your rude question.\u2019 What it <i>meant </i>was \u2018Keep talking and soon you won\u2019t be able to.\u2019</p><p>But Peter wasn\u2019t done yet.</p><p>\u201cI told you what I was feeling.\u201d His voice was quieter now, though not controlled - more, <i>yelling is exhausting but I\u2019m still pissed</i>. \u201cI was <i>honest </i>with you. I was honest for the first time in three years in hopes that you would help me, and maybe be more compassionate, but instead you\u2019re treating me like - like a prisoner! And you - you realize that all this guilt-tripping stuff, it\u2019s just making it worse, right? It just makes me want to die <i>more </i>but I can\u2019t and I get that\u2019s what you were trying to do but now I\u2019m <i>miserable</i> and <i>gosh</i>, I just want to throw myself off a bridge right now-\u201d</p><p>Peter cut himself off at the sudden honesty.</p><p>He had never - he had never said that <i>out loud</i> before, and saying it out loud made it real-</p><p>but it didn\u2019t make it less true.</p><p>Suddenly, Tony was pulling off the road into a gas station parking lot. He parked the car before turning completely in his chair to look at Peter, who stared back, self-conscious.</p><p>\u201cThree years?\u201d he repeated quietly, hurt clear in his eyes so intense Peter couldn\u2019t keep eye contact. Instead, he looked down to where his hands were fiddling in his lap and nodded solemnly.</p><p>\u201cSince I was thirteen,\u201d he mumbled. \u201cSeventh grade.\u201d</p><p>Before he knew it, Tony was unbuckling his seatbelt and leaning forwards across the center console to pull Peter into a tight hug. Peter tensed at the sudden contact after being so- so <i>disrespectful</i>, but tentatively leaned into it, before thinking, <i>Screw it</i>, and wrapping his arms just as tight around his dad.</p><p>He knew the feeling of the console jutting into Tony\u2019s stomach couldn\u2019t have felt comfortable, but he guessed the feeling of his kid in his arms more than made up for it.</p><p>Suddenly, Peter realized he was <i>crying</i>, the feeling of being held so tightly, surrounded by so much <i>love </i>after feeling undeserving, unlovable, causing all his walls to crumble. Tony\u2019s hand found its way into Peter\u2019s curls, and though he did it often Peter knew he would <i>never </i>get tired of it, melting into the touch.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Tony mumbled, kissing his kid\u2019s head before resting his chin atop it. \u201cI was scared. Peter, I was <i>so </i>scared. I didn\u2019t know what to do. I didn\u2019t want to lose you.\u201d</p><p>Peter was going to respond with <i>I\u2019m not going anywhere</i>, but realized they had already distinguished that as a lie. He stayed quiet instead, breathing in the faint scent of motor oil and pine-scented car freshener. The smells of safety; the smells of <i>home</i>.</p><p>After a moment of comfortable silence, Peter stuttered out a quick, \u201cDid you put your tracker in my watch?\u201d</p><p>Tony stilled. \u201cHow\u2019d you know?\u201d</p><p>Peter laughed lightly as he detangled himself from Tony\u2019s grasp. \u201cIt was heavier than usual.\u201d</p><p>Tony sighed, feigning frustration. \u201cOf course you would notice.\u201d</p><p>The silence returned, but this time it wasn\u2019t so comfortable. The jokes were over - both could tell - and now it was time for the more\u2026 <i>serious </i>side of things.</p><p>\u201cJust, don\u2019t treat me like a prisoner,\u201d Peter said seriously. \u201cI just need - gosh, I feel like a child asking for this - I just need support sometimes, and someone to talk to, <i>without </i>judgement, when it gets hard.\u201d</p><p>Tony nodded eagerly. \u201cKid, you <i>always </i>had that. I thought you knew that.\u201d</p><p>Peter shrugged, cheeks faintly flushed, avoiding eye contact.</p><p>\u201cIt - it was just hard to remember sometimes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, kid,\u201d Tony spoke softly, taking Peter\u2019s hand in his own and rubbing a gentle finger over his knuckles. \u201cI\u2019m always there for you. Don\u2019t you ever forget it.\u201d</p><p>Peter shot him a grateful smile, and waited for Tony to say what was clearly on his mind.</p><p>The older man cleared his throat, his eyes seeming to darken.</p><p>\u201cPeter, have you ever given a thought to\u2026 therapy?\u201d</p><p>Peter tensed at the word.</p><p>Truth was, he <i>had </i>thought about it. He knew this whole <i>depression </i>thing was taking over his life, ruining everything - affecting every decision, his very <i>future</i>.</p><p>Some days, he thought seeing a therapist wasn\u2019t the worst idea. Maybe they <i>could </i>help. Maybe he could start <i>living </i>again.</p><p>Others, it seemed like the Worst Possible Thing. He was too far past saving. Nothing could be done. Plus, seeing a therapist was <i>so </i>expensive - what if Tony finally realized Peter wasn\u2019t worth it? And also, if that wasn\u2019t enough, who knew if he\u2019d even be able to <i>speak </i>to a therapist?</p><p><i>What\u2019s bothering you?</i></p><p><i>I\u2019m depressed, but not depressed-depressed, because sometimes I\u2019m really sad and other times I\u2019m not, and I have no reason to be so I guess it\u2019s not really true. And also, I\u2019m Spiderman, which I\u2019m not supposed to tell you, and I see civilians die, like, once a week, maybe? Also, my Uncle Ben died in front of my eyes when I was younger, my parents even before that, but I got used to it and I was fine until my Aunt died too. I was trapped under a building, my crush\u2019s dad tried to kill me, and also I\u2019m shoved against lockers every day by bullies because I\u2019m only a high school freshman. What\u2019s up with you?</i></p><p>Yeah, that would go over well.</p><p>\u201cAny thoughts?\u201d</p><p><i>Oh</i>, Peter realized with a start. Tony was still waiting on an answer.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, Mr. Stark,\u201d he said quietly, embarrassed. \u201cI mean, other people have it worse than me, right? Why would someone waste their time talking to me, a sort-of-sad-but-maybe-it\u2019s-just-teen-angst kid, when they could be helping someone who <i>really </i>needs it?\u201d</p><p>Tony shot him a look that Peter recognized as something close to pity, but not quite.</p><p>\u201cPeter, you have <i>got </i>to give yourself credit sometimes. You almost-\u201d He had to stop himself. Breathe. Compose. Try again. \u201cYou almost <i>killed </i>yourself, Peter. You deserve to get help. And even if you didn\u2019t, even if things had never gotten that extreme - damn it, Peter, you <i>deserve </i>to feel better. You don\u2019t deserve to feel anything less than perfect!\u201d</p><p>The tone of his voice didn\u2019t match the passionate fire of his words. It was sad, upset, ready to be overcome with tears at any given moment.</p><p>\u201cPlease, Peter, let me help you.\u201d</p><p>Peter let out a dejected sigh.</p><p>\u201cFor the record, I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll help.\u201d</p><p>Tony didn\u2019t say anything.</p><p>\u201cAnd I really don\u2019t deserve it.\u201d</p><p>He looked like he wanted to interrupt, but was biting his tongue.</p><p>\u201cAnd it\u2019s really expensive-\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about the money!\u201d he finally blurted, and Peter chuckled inwardly. Of course that was the one trigger, the one thing Tony spoke out on, that he made sure wasn\u2019t an issue - the one thing he had easy control over.</p><p>With one final, heavy sigh, Peter closed his eyes, sure he was going to regret what he said.</p><p>\u201cFine. I\u2019ll go to therapy.\u201d</p><p>His sinking heart was immediately lifted when he heard the - the <i>giggle </i>from\u2026 <i>Tony Stark</i>?</p><p>\u201cDid you just-\u201d he let his eyes flutter open for emphasis- \u201c<i>giggle</i>?\u201d</p><p>Tony clamped a hand over his widely-grinning mouth.</p><p>\u201cDid I just win an argument against the most stubborn kid in the world?\u201d</p><p>Peter rolled his eyes. <i>Gosh</i>, his dad was a dork. He was going to be stuck with him forever, wasn\u2019t he?</p><p>Peter opened his arms once more, and the two collapsed into a hug of comfort, and protection - of safety, and love.</p><p>Of family.</p><p>\u29df<b> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</b><i>One week later \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</i>\u29df</p><p>As the car pulled up outside of the modest-looking two storey, Peter wanted nothing more than to sink down into his seat and never resurface.</p><p>The first day of therapy.</p><p>He\u2019d be lying if he said a small, miniscule part of him wasn\u2019t excited. It was a chance to heal himself, restore him to what he used to be.</p><p>But a (much) larger part of himself was <i>terrified</i>.</p><p>What if the therapist knocked down a wall Peter forgot he had up? Brought forward some terrible memories that just made this whole <i>life </i>thing worse?</p><p>Peter had finally gotten semi-control over himself - what if all his progress was ruined for Tony\u2019s want for Peter\u2019s recovery to be professional?</p><p>\u201cI mean, what qualifies someone as a professional, anyways?\u201d Peter continued the argument aloud as Tony started exiting the car. Peter stayed put. \u201cShouldn\u2019t <i>I </i>be trusted to heal <i>myself</i>? I mean, I know me best. She doesn\u2019t know anything about me.\u201d Tony had prepped Peter on the way over. His therapist was someone Tony had found after hours of thorough Google searches - someone named Adrienne.</p><p>Tony just rolled his eyes and said a quick, \u201cCome on, Spiderbaby. Get out of the car,\u201d before slamming the door and crossing his arms and tapping his foot, acting impatient. (Peter knew Tony really had all the time in the world for him.)</p><p>Peter sighed, getting out of the car and closing the door behind him.</p><p>\u201cI mean, really,\u201d he tried one final attempt (though he knew it was futile) to derail Tony as he locked the door behind him and they began to ascend the few steps leading up to the house. \u201cI should be trusted to know myself!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe quiet and go talk about your feelings, and if I don\u2019t see any tears by the time I pick you up,\u201d Tony \u2018threatened\u2019 with gritted teeth, ringing the doorbell. He slung an arm around Peter\u2019s shoulders and shook him lightly, giving him a comforting smile before the door opened.</p><p>\u29df</p><p>Peter exited the house an hour later, looking surprisingly\u2026 unaffected. Tony was waiting for him in the car, typing away on his Starkpad, but he looked up at the first sign of movement, quickly exiting the car and skipping steps to reach where Peter was just stepping over the threshold, pulling the door shut behind him.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d it go, bud?\u201d he asked lightly, ruffling the kid\u2019s hair. Peter gently pushed his hand away, but Tony knew it was only because they were in public. He <i>loved </i>when Tony played with his hair.</p><p>\u201cActually\u2026 <i>okay</i>.\u201d Peter looked confused at the lack of horrible, life-changing events, and Tony finally allowed himself to smirk, knowing the kid couldn\u2019t see him.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t told a <i>complete </i>lie; he <i>had </i>spent hours searching online for the perfect therapist, but not for Peter, for <i>himself</i>, and not over the past week, either. Really, he had been going to Adrienne biweekly since New York (though Peter being younger would be going weekly). And she had been a <i>huge </i>help.</p><p>Tony wasn\u2019t really hiding it, per se; he just didn\u2019t feel like anyone needed to know. Maybe he\u2019d tell Peter later, but for now, he wanted Peter to think Tony was someone stable for him to lean on. (He didn\u2019t realize the thought of someone Peter trusted going through the same thing as him would help him come to terms with it - or maybe Tony did. Maybe Tony was scared to be open about his weaknesses, but really, who was to tell?)</p><p>\u201cWhat did you guys talk about? If you don\u2019t mind me asking,\u201d Tony asked as they reached the car, pulling the door open for Peter to climb in, before jogging to the other side to get in himself.</p><p>\u201cShe just asked me about what I liked to do and stuff. We talked about Brooklyn Nine-Nine for a solid 20 minutes. Turns out she likes the show, too.\u201d</p><p>Tony bit back his smile. During <i>his </i>first session, they had talked about cars. Adrienne had known a surprising amount - her niece was a mechanic, too, and taught her enough to keep up with everything Tony was talking about, which was no easy feat. That was when Tony knew she was perfect for him - and would be for Peter, too.</p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t do any actual <i>talking </i>stuff,\u201d Peter muttered, almost to himself, and Tony knew he was trying to figure out why. Was it a scheme, or was she actually just the fraud he had suspected?</p><p>The next week\u2019s session seemed to answer his question.</p><p>Tony immediately knew this night would be different from last week\u2019s when Peter slouched out of the house, eyes trained on the floor, feet dragging on the pavement. Tony was ready for him as soon as he came out.</p><p>\u201cA bit harder today?\u201d he asked quietly when they were safely inside the car, driving home. Peter nodded, but didn\u2019t say anything more. Tony let the answer they were both expecting hang in the air for a moment before voicing it.</p><p>\u201cWant to talk about it?\u201d</p><p>Peter shook his head, which Tony was expecting. Instead, he wrapped the kid in his fluffiest blanket as soon as the pair got home, and they fell asleep on the couch watching Brooklyn Nine-Nine reruns. They didn\u2019t talk about the sessions, or what Peter was thinking, and Tony didn\u2019t question it.</p><p>He knew Peter would come to him if there was something he wanted to say.</p><p>There was no telling what each session would bring. Some were better than others.</p><p>Some days, Peter came bounding down the stone steps, the living embodiment of sunshine.</p><p>Others, he barely had the strength to stagger down the stairs without collapsing. Tony would be there for him the entire way, supporting him without a question, knowing two bowls of ice cream and unlimited blankets were awaiting them at home.</p><p>Days, in general, were unpredictable. Tony could usually tell from the get-go what kind of day Peter was going to have. He was either smiling, or could barely get out of bed.</p><p>On the good days, Tony smiled back. Made him pancakes, ruffled his hair, did anything in his power to keep it that way.</p><p>On the bad days, Peter would barely have the strength to get out of bed - but Tony would never leave his side then, either. He would say encouraging words, help guide him out the door. Send him encouraging messages throughout the school day for the kid to read during lunch, or between periods. (Peter would be lying if he said they didn\u2019t help, even just a tad.)</p><p>But there were other days where Tony just couldn\u2019t tell.</p><p>Peter woke up wearing a smile that Tony saw straight through, feeling, for whatever reason, that he needed to mask what he was feeling. Tony would encourage him to open up, even offer to sign him out of school for the day if he was being relentless. Tony didn\u2019t want that wall coming down mid-school day and having Peter upset surrounded by his peers. He knew how difficult a bunch of pubescent kids could be.</p><p>Other days, Peter woke up one way and came home from school the other. It was always a pleasant surprise when he came home smiling after seeming so miserable just that morning; but at other times, if something had happened at school to tarnish Peter\u2019s positive morning attitude, Tony just held him close and promised him it would be okay.</p><p>It took a while for that promise to actually come to life.</p><p>Peter expected to feel better within the first few weeks of therapy. When he didn\u2019t, the month. Then, the season. And, upsettingly, he didn\u2019t even feel one hundred percent back by the end of the year.</p><p>But he <i>did </i>feel better.</p><p>The thoughts in Peter\u2019s mind weren\u2019t as dark as they once had been. He didn\u2019t associate a bridge with jumping, a body of water with drowning. An incorrect answer in school didn\u2019t start a whirlwind of negative thoughts.</p><p>Of course, there were still bad days where Peter woke up in the morning and just\u2026 didn\u2019t feel like moving. And it sucked. He knew that no matter what happened, no matter what Tony tried to do to help him (and he tried a lot), the day was just a waste.</p><p>But he went to bed, and woke up the next morning with a fresh new attitude, and hoped that this day would be better than the last.</p><p>Peter wasn\u2019t feeling perfect, but he was feeling better.</p><p>And maybe that was enough.</p>",

Please be careful!! &lt;3</i></b>\n\n<br></p><hr><p>Peter made his way through the school day like a ghost, the morning\u2019s conversation playing in his mind on repeat.</p><p><i>If you died, you know I would follow</i>.</p><p>The comment sat heavy in Peter\u2019s mind like a rock, weighing him down, affecting every aspect of that day.</p>[[MORE]]<p>When he was called on to answer a question in class, got it wrong, and starting mentally torturing himself, he froze and thought, <i>Don\u2019t do this to Mr. Stark</i>.</p><p>When an event that triggered his anxiety caused him to dig his fingers into his palms, he imagined the same crescents mirrored on Tony\u2019s scarred hands, and he stopped himself pretty fast.</p><p>When the self-deprecating thoughts invaded his head every half hour like clockwork, when they got too loud and the thought to take action unsurprisingly brought every other thought to a halt, Peter had to stop himself and <i>breathe </i>until he regained at least partial sanity. Because whatever method he debated using - jumping off a bridge, drowning himself in a river - he imagined the same thing happening to Mr. Stark, to his <i>dad</i>, and that thought in itself brought bouts of panic.</p><p>He understood what Mr. Stark was trying to say. If Peter put himself in harm\u2019s way, Tony wouldn\u2019t follow long after. If it was supposed to bring Peter comfort, or a sense of support, or what, he didn\u2019t know - because all he felt when he thought of Mr. Stark\u2019s body lying mangled on a block of pavement, or being pulled, bruised and blue, from a river, all Peter felt was intense <i>guilt</i>.</p><p>Maybe Tony thought that would make Peter stop, rethink his choices, realize he had people in his corner - but instead, it just made Peter want to end it all even <i>more</i>. If he was letting down Tony so much, why should he still burden him? But that just caused the guilt to grow even <i>stronger</i>, and by the time the final dismissal bell rang, Peter was in a vicious cycle of guilt and pain.</p><p>For a minute, he was excited to sprint out the doors and into Tony\u2019s waiting car, to rid himself of the dark thoughts crowding his own mind, but today he had to stop himself, realizing Tony was the <i>cause </i>of this.</p><p>Peter momentarily debated telling Tony a surprise Decathlon meeting had been called and he had to stay late - or maybe he could say he was doing homework in the library.</p><p>His heart sank to his shoes when he realized he was a <i>terrible </i>liar and Tony would easily see through him.</p><p>He stopped at his locker and tried to take as long as possible to pack his bag, debating whether or not to take home his math textbook even though he had finished all his work during the day, just for an excuse to retire to his room; though, he guessed Tony would just follow him.</p><p>Sighing, he slammed his locker shut and slouched his way out the door, immediately finding the white Audi in the parking lot. (It wasn\u2019t hard - by the time Peter left the school, most of the other cars had already pulled away.) He plastered on a smile as he pulled open the back door and climbed in, hoping to avoid an awkward conversation by getting into the passenger seat. The judgemental look Tony shot him told him that was the wrong choice.</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019d you get in the back?\u201d</p><p>Peter stared back, trying to look innocent.</p><p>\u201cThe door was closer than walking all the way around.\u201d</p><p>Tony looked unconvinced. \u201cKid, I showered this morning. I don\u2019t smell.\u201d</p><p>Peter chuckled as if he was making a harmless joke and looked out the window, praying Tony would just drop it and drive away. He should\u2019ve known he was too stubborn.</p><p>\u201cGet in the front, Pete.\u201d</p><p>Peter was surprised at how much his heartbeat increased as he reshouldered his backpack, got out of the car, climbed into the passenger seat, and buckled up his seatbelt, all the while refusing to look at Tony - meaning he didn\u2019t see the man take off his sunglasses in order to look at Peter without anything between them.</p><p>After a minute of silence and Peter looking dutifully out the window, Tony finally sighed, turned the key in the ignition, and began the fifteen-minute drive back to the tower.</p><p>\u201cHow was school today?\u201d he asked nonchalantly as he turned out of the parking lot. Peter continued to stare out the window at his classmates in passing cars.</p><p><i>I bet none of them are depressed.</i></p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>Tony had to keep his head from whipping around to stare at the kid. <i>Was that a one-word answer? </i>Suddenly, Tony realized he had been getting a lot of one-word answers from Peter lately. He just wasn\u2019t the talkative kid he used to be. Again, Tony wondered how he could\u2019ve been so ignorant not to notice the signs, the calls for help.</p><p>\u201cDo anything different today? Learn anything cool?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really.\u201d</p><p>Another look at the kid showed him practically pressed against the door, his face fully turned towards the window, his head back against the seat as if he was too tired to hold it up, and it was just too heavy - which, Tony realized with a start, was probably <i>exactly </i>how it felt.</p><p>Tony sighed at the lack of a response. \u201cListen, kid, we have fifteen minutes in this car together, so why don\u2019t you just tell me what\u2019s up and we can avoid making this more awkward than it has to be?\u201d</p><p>Peter shut his eyes momentarily, wincing against the harshness in his voice, but turned his head from the window to meet Tony\u2019s expectant gaze, albeit hesitantly.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know what I have to say won\u2019t make it more awkward?\u201d</p><p>Tony turned his attention back to the windshield, trying not to let it show how much that comment bothered him.</p><p>\u201cTry me.\u201d</p><p>Peter sighed in frustration.</p><p>\u201cI already know the worst of it, kid,\u201d Tony continued at the noise, hoping, praying, that the statement was true - that there were no other horrors Peter had been hiding, shouldering on his own. \u201cYou might as well just let the rest out.\u201d</p><p>Peter knew Tony was right. He knew what he had been keeping inside wasn\u2019t necessarily <i>worse </i>- but he also knew it wasn\u2019t quite <i>better</i>, either. Nevertheless, Tony was waiting on an answer, so an answer, Peter would give.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like that you\u2019re managing me so closely,\u201d he whispered, scared to speak any louder, but Tony cleared his throat.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t hear you, bud, you\u2019re gonna half to speak up-\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>I don\u2019t like that you\u2019re managing me so closely</i>,\u201d he repeated louder, just a notch below shouting, causing Tony\u2019s eyebrows to raise significantly as his hands clenched tighter around the wheel.</p><p>Peter wanted to feel embarrassed at his sudden outburst. Any other day, he would\u2019ve been. But it felt <i>so good </i>to get this tightness out of his chest, to dislodge the heavy stone that had been weighing him down since - well, he couldn\u2019t even remember when.</p><p>All that he <i>did </i>know was that it felt <i>so good </i>to yell.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t let me leave your sight last night. You asked F.R.I.D.A.Y. to <i>lock the windows </i>when I went to the bathroom! I know my way to the living room, Tony!\u201d</p><p>Tony\u2019s eyebrow was cocked, his mouth set in a firm line.</p><p>Peter was crossing the line. He <i>knew </i>he was. He knew he sounded nothing like himself, and he knew how disrespectful he was being. He was <i>definitely </i>going to pay for it later.</p><p>Right now, though, he was <i>finally </i>getting it off his chest. He was <i>finally </i>telling someone. Even if that someone would probably get his own two cents in once Peter was done, he was finally <i>talking</i>.</p><p>And it felt <i>good</i>.</p><p>\u201cYou wanted to keep me in my room this morning, and you hid the knives from me! <i>Gosh</i>, Tony, I\u2019m not a child!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was trying to keep you <i>safe</i>.\u201d</p><p>Tony\u2019s voice was surprisingly calm, but Peter had heard it used at enough press events to know what it meant. What it came off as was \u2018I\u2019m going to cooly answer your rude question.\u2019 What it <i>meant </i>was \u2018Keep talking and soon you won\u2019t be able to.\u2019</p><p>But Peter wasn\u2019t done yet.</p><p>\u201cI told you what I was feeling.\u201d His voice was quieter now, though not controlled - more, <i>yelling is exhausting but I\u2019m still pissed</i>. \u201cI was <i>honest </i>with you. I was honest for the first time in three years in hopes that you would help me, and maybe be more compassionate, but instead you\u2019re treating me like - like a prisoner! And you - you realize that all this guilt-tripping stuff, it\u2019s just making it worse, right? It just makes me want to die <i>more </i>but I can\u2019t and I get that\u2019s what you were trying to do but now I\u2019m <i>miserable</i> and <i>gosh</i>, I just want to throw myself off a bridge right now-\u201d</p><p>Peter cut himself off at the sudden honesty.</p><p>He had never - he had never said that <i>out loud</i> before, and saying it out loud made it real-</p><p>but it didn\u2019t make it less true.</p><p>Suddenly, Tony was pulling off the road into a gas station parking lot. He parked the car before turning completely in his chair to look at Peter, who stared back, self-conscious.</p><p>\u201cThree years?\u201d he repeated quietly, hurt clear in his eyes so intense Peter couldn\u2019t keep eye contact. Instead, he looked down to where his hands were fiddling in his lap and nodded solemnly.</p><p>\u201cSince I was thirteen,\u201d he mumbled. \u201cSeventh grade.\u201d</p><p>Before he knew it, Tony was unbuckling his seatbelt and leaning forwards across the center console to pull Peter into a tight hug. Peter tensed at the sudden contact after being so- so <i>disrespectful</i>, but tentatively leaned into it, before thinking, <i>Screw it</i>, and wrapping his arms just as tight around his dad.</p><p>He knew the feeling of the console jutting into Tony\u2019s stomach couldn\u2019t have felt comfortable, but he guessed the feeling of his kid in his arms more than made up for it.</p><p>Suddenly, Peter realized he was <i>crying</i>, the feeling of being held so tightly, surrounded by so much <i>love </i>after feeling undeserving, unlovable, causing all his walls to crumble. Tony\u2019s hand found its way into Peter\u2019s curls, and though he did it often Peter knew he would <i>never </i>get tired of it, melting into the touch.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Tony mumbled, kissing his kid\u2019s head before resting his chin atop it. \u201cI was scared. Peter, I was <i>so </i>scared. I didn\u2019t know what to do. I didn\u2019t want to lose you.\u201d</p><p>Peter was going to respond with <i>I\u2019m not going anywhere</i>, but realized they had already distinguished that as a lie. He stayed quiet instead, breathing in the faint scent of motor oil and pine-scented car freshener. The smells of safety; the smells of <i>home</i>.</p><p>After a moment of comfortable silence, Peter stuttered out a quick, \u201cDid you put your tracker in my watch?\u201d</p><p>Tony stilled. \u201cHow\u2019d you know?\u201d</p><p>Peter laughed lightly as he detangled himself from Tony\u2019s grasp. \u201cIt was heavier than usual.\u201d</p><p>Tony sighed, feigning frustration. \u201cOf course you would notice.\u201d</p><p>The silence returned, but this time it wasn\u2019t so comfortable. The jokes were over - both could tell - and now it was time for the more\u2026 <i>serious </i>side of things.</p><p>\u201cJust, don\u2019t treat me like a prisoner,\u201d Peter said seriously. \u201cI just need - gosh, I feel like a child asking for this - I just need support sometimes, and someone to talk to, <i>without </i>judgement, when it gets hard.\u201d</p><p>Tony nodded eagerly. \u201cKid, you <i>always </i>had that. I thought you knew that.\u201d</p><p>Peter shrugged, cheeks faintly flushed, avoiding eye contact.</p><p>\u201cIt - it was just hard to remember sometimes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, kid,\u201d Tony spoke softly, taking Peter\u2019s hand in his own and rubbing a gentle finger over his knuckles. \u201cI\u2019m always there for you. Don\u2019t you ever forget it.\u201d</p><p>Peter shot him a grateful smile, and waited for Tony to say what was clearly on his mind.</p><p>The older man cleared his throat, his eyes seeming to darken.</p><p>\u201cPeter, have you ever given a thought to\u2026 therapy?\u201d</p><p>Peter tensed at the word.</p><p>Truth was, he <i>had </i>thought about it. He knew this whole <i>depression </i>thing was taking over his life, ruining everything - affecting every decision, his very <i>future</i>.</p><p>Some days, he thought seeing a therapist wasn\u2019t the worst idea. Maybe they <i>could </i>help. Maybe he could start <i>living </i>again.</p><p>Others, it seemed like the Worst Possible Thing. He was too far past saving. Nothing could be done. Plus, seeing a therapist was <i>so </i>expensive - what if Tony finally realized Peter wasn\u2019t worth it? And also, if that wasn\u2019t enough, who knew if he\u2019d even be able to <i>speak </i>to a therapist?</p><p><i>What\u2019s bothering you?</i></p><p><i>I\u2019m depressed, but not depressed-depressed, because sometimes I\u2019m really sad and other times I\u2019m not, and I have no reason to be so I guess it\u2019s not really true. And also, I\u2019m Spiderman, which I\u2019m not supposed to tell you, and I see civilians die, like, once a week, maybe? Also, my Uncle Ben died in front of my eyes when I was younger, my parents even before that, but I got used to it and I was fine until my Aunt died too. I was trapped under a building, my crush\u2019s dad tried to kill me, and also I\u2019m shoved against lockers every day by bullies because I\u2019m only a high school freshman. What\u2019s up with you?</i></p><p>Yeah, that would go over well.</p><p>\u201cAny thoughts?\u201d</p><p><i>Oh</i>, Peter realized with a start. Tony was still waiting on an answer.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, Mr. Stark,\u201d he said quietly, embarrassed. \u201cI mean, other people have it worse than me, right? Why would someone waste their time talking to me, a sort-of-sad-but-maybe-it\u2019s-just-teen-angst kid, when they could be helping someone who <i>really </i>needs it?\u201d</p><p>Tony shot him a look that Peter recognized as something close to pity, but not quite.</p><p>\u201cPeter, you have <i>got </i>to give yourself credit sometimes. You almost-\u201d He had to stop himself. Breathe. Compose. Try again. \u201cYou almost <i>killed </i>yourself, Peter. You deserve to get help. And even if you didn\u2019t, even if things had never gotten that extreme - damn it, Peter, you <i>deserve </i>to feel better. You don\u2019t deserve to feel anything less than perfect!\u201d</p><p>The tone of his voice didn\u2019t match the passionate fire of his words. It was sad, upset, ready to be overcome with tears at any given moment.</p><p>\u201cPlease, Peter, let me help you.\u201d</p><p>Peter let out a dejected sigh.</p><p>\u201cFor the record, I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll help.\u201d</p><p>Tony didn\u2019t say anything.</p><p>\u201cAnd I really don\u2019t deserve it.\u201d</p><p>He looked like he wanted to interrupt, but was biting his tongue.</p><p>\u201cAnd it\u2019s really expensive-\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about the money!\u201d he finally blurted, and Peter chuckled inwardly. Of course that was the one trigger, the one thing Tony spoke out on, that he made sure wasn\u2019t an issue - the one thing he had easy control over.</p><p>With one final, heavy sigh, Peter closed his eyes, sure he was going to regret what he said.</p><p>\u201cFine. I\u2019ll go to therapy.\u201d</p><p>His sinking heart was immediately lifted when he heard the - the <i>giggle </i>from\u2026 <i>Tony Stark</i>?</p><p>\u201cDid you just-\u201d he let his eyes flutter open for emphasis- \u201c<i>giggle</i>?\u201d</p><p>Tony clamped a hand over his widely-grinning mouth.</p><p>\u201cDid I just win an argument against the most stubborn kid in the world?\u201d</p><p>Peter rolled his eyes. <i>Gosh</i>, his dad was a dork. He was going to be stuck with him forever, wasn\u2019t he?</p><p>Peter opened his arms once more, and the two collapsed into a hug of comfort, and protection - of safety, and love.</p><p>Of family.</p><p>\u29df<b> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</b><i>One week later \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</i>\u29df</p><p>As the car pulled up outside of the modest-looking two storey, Peter wanted nothing more than to sink down into his seat and never resurface.</p><p>The first day of therapy.</p><p>He\u2019d be lying if he said a small, miniscule part of him wasn\u2019t excited. It was a chance to heal himself, restore him to what he used to be.</p><p>But a (much) larger part of himself was <i>terrified</i>.</p><p>What if the therapist knocked down a wall Peter forgot he had up? Brought forward some terrible memories that just made this whole <i>life </i>thing worse?</p><p>Peter had finally gotten semi-control over himself - what if all his progress was ruined for Tony\u2019s want for Peter\u2019s recovery to be professional?</p><p>\u201cI mean, what qualifies someone as a professional, anyways?\u201d Peter continued the argument aloud as Tony started exiting the car. Peter stayed put. \u201cShouldn\u2019t <i>I </i>be trusted to heal <i>myself</i>? I mean, I know me best. She doesn\u2019t know anything about me.\u201d Tony had prepped Peter on the way over. His therapist was someone Tony had found after hours of thorough Google searches - someone named Adrienne.</p><p>Tony just rolled his eyes and said a quick, \u201cCome on, Spiderbaby. Get out of the car,\u201d before slamming the door and crossing his arms and tapping his foot, acting impatient. (Peter knew Tony really had all the time in the world for him.)</p><p>Peter sighed, getting out of the car and closing the door behind him.</p><p>\u201cI mean, really,\u201d he tried one final attempt (though he knew it was futile) to derail Tony as he locked the door behind him and they began to ascend the few steps leading up to the house. \u201cI should be trusted to know myself!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe quiet and go talk about your feelings, and if I don\u2019t see any tears by the time I pick you up,\u201d Tony \u2018threatened\u2019 with gritted teeth, ringing the doorbell. He slung an arm around Peter\u2019s shoulders and shook him lightly, giving him a comforting smile before the door opened.</p><p>\u29df</p><p>Peter exited the house an hour later, looking surprisingly\u2026 unaffected. Tony was waiting for him in the car, typing away on his Starkpad, but he looked up at the first sign of movement, quickly exiting the car and skipping steps to reach where Peter was just stepping over the threshold, pulling the door shut behind him.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d it go, bud?\u201d he asked lightly, ruffling the kid\u2019s hair. Peter gently pushed his hand away, but Tony knew it was only because they were in public. He <i>loved </i>when Tony played with his hair.</p><p>\u201cActually\u2026 <i>okay</i>.\u201d Peter looked confused at the lack of horrible, life-changing events, and Tony finally allowed himself to smirk, knowing the kid couldn\u2019t see him.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t told a <i>complete </i>lie; he <i>had </i>spent hours searching online for the perfect therapist, but not for Peter, for <i>himself</i>, and not over the past week, either. Really, he had been going to Adrienne biweekly since New York (though Peter being younger would be going weekly). And she had been a <i>huge </i>help.</p><p>Tony wasn\u2019t really hiding it, per se; he just didn\u2019t feel like anyone needed to know. Maybe he\u2019d tell Peter later, but for now, he wanted Peter to think Tony was someone stable for him to lean on. (He didn\u2019t realize the thought of someone Peter trusted going through the same thing as him would help him come to terms with it - or maybe Tony did. Maybe Tony was scared to be open about his weaknesses, but really, who was to tell?)</p><p>\u201cWhat did you guys talk about? If you don\u2019t mind me asking,\u201d Tony asked as they reached the car, pulling the door open for Peter to climb in, before jogging to the other side to get in himself.</p><p>\u201cShe just asked me about what I liked to do and stuff. We talked about Brooklyn Nine-Nine for a solid 20 minutes. Turns out she likes the show, too.\u201d</p><p>Tony bit back his smile. During <i>his </i>first session, they had talked about cars. Adrienne had known a surprising amount - her niece was a mechanic, too, and taught her enough to keep up with everything Tony was talking about, which was no easy feat. That was when Tony knew she was perfect for him - and would be for Peter, too.</p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t do any actual <i>talking </i>stuff,\u201d Peter muttered, almost to himself, and Tony knew he was trying to figure out why. Was it a scheme, or was she actually just the fraud he had suspected?</p><p>The next week\u2019s session seemed to answer his question.</p><p>Tony immediately knew this night would be different from last week\u2019s when Peter slouched out of the house, eyes trained on the floor, feet dragging on the pavement. Tony was ready for him as soon as he came out.</p><p>\u201cA bit harder today?\u201d he asked quietly when they were safely inside the car, driving home. Peter nodded, but didn\u2019t say anything more. Tony let the answer they were both expecting hang in the air for a moment before voicing it.</p><p>\u201cWant to talk about it?\u201d</p><p>Peter shook his head, which Tony was expecting. Instead, he wrapped the kid in his fluffiest blanket as soon as the pair got home, and they fell asleep on the couch watching Brooklyn Nine-Nine reruns. They didn\u2019t talk about the sessions, or what Peter was thinking, and Tony didn\u2019t question it.</p><p>He knew Peter would come to him if there was something he wanted to say.</p><p>There was no telling what each session would bring. Some were better than others.</p><p>Some days, Peter came bounding down the stone steps, the living embodiment of sunshine.</p><p>Others, he barely had the strength to stagger down the stairs without collapsing. Tony would be there for him the entire way, supporting him without a question, knowing two bowls of ice cream and unlimited blankets were awaiting them at home.</p><p>Days, in general, were unpredictable. Tony could usually tell from the get-go what kind of day Peter was going to have. He was either smiling, or could barely get out of bed.</p><p>On the good days, Tony smiled back. Made him pancakes, ruffled his hair, did anything in his power to keep it that way.</p><p>On the bad days, Peter would barely have the strength to get out of bed - but Tony would never leave his side then, either. He would say encouraging words, help guide him out the door. Send him encouraging messages throughout the school day for the kid to read during lunch, or between periods. (Peter would be lying if he said they didn\u2019t help, even just a tad.)</p><p>But there were other days where Tony just couldn\u2019t tell.</p><p>Peter woke up wearing a smile that Tony saw straight through, feeling, for whatever reason, that he needed to mask what he was feeling. Tony would encourage him to open up, even offer to sign him out of school for the day if he was being relentless. Tony didn\u2019t want that wall coming down mid-school day and having Peter upset surrounded by his peers. He knew how difficult a bunch of pubescent kids could be.</p><p>Other days, Peter woke up one way and came home from school the other. It was always a pleasant surprise when he came home smiling after seeming so miserable just that morning; but at other times, if something had happened at school to tarnish Peter\u2019s positive morning attitude, Tony just held him close and promised him it would be okay.</p><p>It took a while for that promise to actually come to life.</p><p>Peter expected to feel better within the first few weeks of therapy. When he didn\u2019t, the month. Then, the season. And, upsettingly, he didn\u2019t even feel one hundred percent back by the end of the year.</p><p>But he <i>did </i>feel better.</p><p>The thoughts in Peter\u2019s mind weren\u2019t as dark as they once had been. He didn\u2019t associate a bridge with jumping, a body of water with drowning. An incorrect answer in school didn\u2019t start a whirlwind of negative thoughts.</p><p>Of course, there were still bad days where Peter woke up in the morning and just\u2026 didn\u2019t feel like moving. And it sucked. He knew that no matter what happened, no matter what Tony tried to do to help him (and he tried a lot), the day was just a waste.</p><p>But he went to bed, and woke up the next morning with a fresh new attitude, and hoped that this day would be better than the last.</p><p>Peter wasn\u2019t feeling perfect, but he was feeling better.</p><p>And maybe that was enough.</p>",
                "content": "<p>\n\n<b><i>Warning: this story is based heavily around suicide, including suicidal thoughts and attempts. Please be careful!! &lt;3</i></b>\n\n<br /></p><hr /><p>Peter made his way through the school day like a ghost, the morning&rsquo;s conversation playing in his mind on repeat.</p><p><i>If you died, you know I would follow</i>.</p><p>The comment sat heavy in Peter&rsquo;s mind like a rock, weighing him down, affecting every aspect of that day.</p><p>When he was called on to answer a question in class, got it wrong, and starting mentally torturing himself, he froze and thought, <i>Don&rsquo;t do this to Mr. Stark</i>.</p><p>When an event that triggered his anxiety caused him to dig his fingers into his palms, he imagined the same crescents mirrored on Tony&rsquo;s scarred hands, and he stopped himself pretty fast.</p><p>When the self-deprecating thoughts invaded his head every half hour like clockwork, when they got too loud and the thought to take action unsurprisingly brought every other thought to a halt, Peter had to stop himself and <i>breathe </i>until he regained at least partial sanity. Because whatever method he debated using - jumping off a bridge, drowning himself in a river - he imagined the same thing happening to Mr. Stark, to his <i>dad</i>, and that thought in itself brought bouts of panic.</p><p>He understood what Mr. Stark was trying to say. If Peter put himself in harm&rsquo;s way, Tony wouldn&rsquo;t follow long after. If it was supposed to bring Peter comfort, or a sense of support, or what, he didn&rsquo;t know - because all he felt when he thought of Mr. Stark&rsquo;s body lying mangled on a block of pavement, or being pulled, bruised and blue, from a river, all Peter felt was intense <i>guilt</i>.</p><p>Maybe Tony thought that would make Peter stop, rethink his choices, realize he had people in his corner - but instead, it just made Peter want to end it all even <i>more</i>. If he was letting down Tony so much, why should he still burden him? But that just caused the guilt to grow even <i>stronger</i>, and by the time the final dismissal bell rang, Peter was in a vicious cycle of guilt and pain.</p><p>For a minute, he was excited to sprint out the doors and into Tony&rsquo;s waiting car, to rid himself of the dark thoughts crowding his own mind, but today he had to stop himself, realizing Tony was the <i>cause </i>of this.</p><p>Peter momentarily debated telling Tony a surprise Decathlon meeting had been called and he had to stay late - or maybe he could say he was doing homework in the library.</p><p>His heart sank to his shoes when he realized he was a <i>terrible </i>liar and Tony would easily see through him.</p><p>He stopped at his locker and tried to take as long as possible to pack his bag, debating whether or not to take home his math textbook even though he had finished all his work during the day, just for an excuse to retire to his room; though, he guessed Tony would just follow him.</p><p>Sighing, he slammed his locker shut and slouched his way out the door, immediately finding the white Audi in the parking lot. (It wasn&rsquo;t hard - by the time Peter left the school, most of the other cars had already pulled away.) He plastered on a smile as he pulled open the back door and climbed in, hoping to avoid an awkward conversation by getting into the passenger seat. The judgemental look Tony shot him told him that was the wrong choice.</p><p>&ldquo;Why&rsquo;d you get in the back?&rdquo;</p><p>Peter stared back, trying to look innocent.</p><p>&ldquo;The door was closer than walking all the way around.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony looked unconvinced. &ldquo;Kid, I showered this morning. I don&rsquo;t smell.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter chuckled as if he was making a harmless joke and looked out the window, praying Tony would just drop it and drive away. He should&rsquo;ve known he was too stubborn.</p><p>&ldquo;Get in the front, Pete.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter was surprised at how much his heartbeat increased as he reshouldered his backpack, got out of the car, climbed into the passenger seat, and buckled up his seatbelt, all the while refusing to look at Tony - meaning he didn&rsquo;t see the man take off his sunglasses in order to look at Peter without anything between them.</p><p>After a minute of silence and Peter looking dutifully out the window, Tony finally sighed, turned the key in the ignition, and began the fifteen-minute drive back to the tower.</p><p>&ldquo;How was school today?&rdquo; he asked nonchalantly as he turned out of the parking lot. Peter continued to stare out the window at his classmates in passing cars.</p><p><i>I bet none of them are depressed.</i></p><p>&ldquo;Fine.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony had to keep his head from whipping around to stare at the kid. <i>Was that a one-word answer? </i>Suddenly, Tony realized he had been getting a lot of one-word answers from Peter lately. He just wasn&rsquo;t the talkative kid he used to be. Again, Tony wondered how he could&rsquo;ve been so ignorant not to notice the signs, the calls for help.</p><p>&ldquo;Do anything different today? Learn anything cool?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not really.&rdquo;</p><p>Another look at the kid showed him practically pressed against the door, his face fully turned towards the window, his head back against the seat as if he was too tired to hold it up, and it was just too heavy - which, Tony realized with a start, was probably <i>exactly </i>how it felt.</p><p>Tony sighed at the lack of a response. &ldquo;Listen, kid, we have fifteen minutes in this car together, so why don&rsquo;t you just tell me what&rsquo;s up and we can avoid making this more awkward than it has to be?&rdquo;</p><p>Peter shut his eyes momentarily, wincing against the harshness in his voice, but turned his head from the window to meet Tony&rsquo;s expectant gaze, albeit hesitantly.</p><p>&ldquo;How do you know what I have to say won&rsquo;t make it more awkward?&rdquo;</p><p>Tony turned his attention back to the windshield, trying not to let it show how much that comment bothered him.</p><p>&ldquo;Try me.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter sighed in frustration.</p><p>&ldquo;I already know the worst of it, kid,&rdquo; Tony continued at the noise, hoping, praying, that the statement was true - that there were no other horrors Peter had been hiding, shouldering on his own. &ldquo;You might as well just let the rest out.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter knew Tony was right. He knew what he had been keeping inside wasn&rsquo;t necessarily <i>worse </i>- but he also knew it wasn&rsquo;t quite <i>better</i>, either. Nevertheless, Tony was waiting on an answer, so an answer, Peter would give.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like that you&rsquo;re managing me so closely,&rdquo; he whispered, scared to speak any louder, but Tony cleared his throat.</p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t hear you, bud, you&rsquo;re gonna half to speak up-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;<i>I don&rsquo;t like that you&rsquo;re managing me so closely</i>,&rdquo; he repeated louder, just a notch below shouting, causing Tony&rsquo;s eyebrows to raise significantly as his hands clenched tighter around the wheel.</p><p>Peter wanted to feel embarrassed at his sudden outburst. Any other day, he would&rsquo;ve been. But it felt <i>so good </i>to get this tightness out of his chest, to dislodge the heavy stone that had been weighing him down since - well, he couldn&rsquo;t even remember when.</p><p>All that he <i>did </i>know was that it felt <i>so good </i>to yell.</p><p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t let me leave your sight last night. You asked F.R.I.D.A.Y. to <i>lock the windows </i>when I went to the bathroom! I know my way to the living room, Tony!&rdquo;</p><p>Tony&rsquo;s eyebrow was cocked, his mouth set in a firm line.</p><p>Peter was crossing the line. He <i>knew </i>he was. He knew he sounded nothing like himself, and he knew how disrespectful he was being. He was <i>definitely </i>going to pay for it later.</p><p>Right now, though, he was <i>finally </i>getting it off his chest. He was <i>finally </i>telling someone. Even if that someone would probably get his own two cents in once Peter was done, he was finally <i>talking</i>.</p><p>And it felt <i>good</i>.</p><p>&ldquo;You wanted to keep me in my room this morning, and you hid the knives from me! <i>Gosh</i>, Tony, I&rsquo;m not a child!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I was trying to keep you <i>safe</i>.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony&rsquo;s voice was surprisingly calm, but Peter had heard it used at enough press events to know what it meant. What it came off as was &lsquo;I&rsquo;m going to cooly answer your rude question.&rsquo; What it <i>meant </i>was &lsquo;Keep talking and soon you won&rsquo;t be able to.&rsquo;</p><p>But Peter wasn&rsquo;t done yet.</p><p>&ldquo;I told you what I was feeling.&rdquo; His voice was quieter now, though not controlled - more, <i>yelling is exhausting but I&rsquo;m still pissed</i>. &ldquo;I was <i>honest </i>with you. I was honest for the first time in three years in hopes that you would help me, and maybe be more compassionate, but instead you&rsquo;re treating me like - like a prisoner! And you - you realize that all this guilt-tripping stuff, it&rsquo;s just making it worse, right? It just makes me want to die <i>more </i>but I can&rsquo;t and I get that&rsquo;s what you were trying to do but now I&rsquo;m <i>miserable</i> and <i>gosh</i>, I just want to throw myself off a bridge right now-&rdquo;</p><p>Peter cut himself off at the sudden honesty.</p><p>He had never - he had never said that <i>out loud</i> before, and saying it out loud made it real-</p><p>but it didn&rsquo;t make it less true.</p><p>Suddenly, Tony was pulling off the road into a gas station parking lot. He parked the car before turning completely in his chair to look at Peter, who stared back, self-conscious.</p><p>&ldquo;Three years?&rdquo; he repeated quietly, hurt clear in his eyes so intense Peter couldn&rsquo;t keep eye contact. Instead, he looked down to where his hands were fiddling in his lap and nodded solemnly.</p><p>&ldquo;Since I was thirteen,&rdquo; he mumbled. &ldquo;Seventh grade.&rdquo;</p><p>Before he knew it, Tony was unbuckling his seatbelt and leaning forwards across the center console to pull Peter into a tight hug. Peter tensed at the sudden contact after being so- so <i>disrespectful</i>, but tentatively leaned into it, before thinking, <i>Screw it</i>, and wrapping his arms just as tight around his dad.</p><p>He knew the feeling of the console jutting into Tony&rsquo;s stomach couldn&rsquo;t have felt comfortable, but he guessed the feeling of his kid in his arms more than made up for it.</p><p>Suddenly, Peter realized he was <i>crying</i>, the feeling of being held so tightly, surrounded by so much <i>love </i>after feeling undeserving, unlovable, causing all his walls to crumble. Tony&rsquo;s hand found its way into Peter&rsquo;s curls, and though he did it often Peter knew he would <i>never </i>get tired of it, melting into the touch.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; Tony mumbled, kissing his kid&rsquo;s head before resting his chin atop it. &ldquo;I was scared. Peter, I was <i>so </i>scared. I didn&rsquo;t know what to do. I didn&rsquo;t want to lose you.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter was going to respond with <i>I&rsquo;m not going anywhere</i>, but realized they had already distinguished that as a lie. He stayed quiet instead, breathing in the faint scent of motor oil and pine-scented car freshener. The smells of safety; the smells of <i>home</i>.</p><p>After a moment of comfortable silence, Peter stuttered out a quick, &ldquo;Did you put your tracker in my watch?&rdquo;</p><p>Tony stilled. &ldquo;How&rsquo;d you know?&rdquo;</p><p>Peter laughed lightly as he detangled himself from Tony&rsquo;s grasp. &ldquo;It was heavier than usual.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony sighed, feigning frustration. &ldquo;Of course you would notice.&rdquo;</p><p>The silence returned, but this time it wasn&rsquo;t so comfortable. The jokes were over - both could tell - and now it was time for the more&hellip; <i>serious </i>side of things.</p><p>&ldquo;Just, don&rsquo;t treat me like a prisoner,&rdquo; Peter said seriously. &ldquo;I just need - gosh, I feel like a child asking for this - I just need support sometimes, and someone to talk to, <i>without </i>judgement, when it gets hard.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony nodded eagerly. &ldquo;Kid, you <i>always </i>had that. I thought you knew that.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter shrugged, cheeks faintly flushed, avoiding eye contact.</p><p>&ldquo;It - it was just hard to remember sometimes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Of course, kid,&rdquo; Tony spoke softly, taking Peter&rsquo;s hand in his own and rubbing a gentle finger over his knuckles. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m always there for you. Don&rsquo;t you ever forget it.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter shot him a grateful smile, and waited for Tony to say what was clearly on his mind.</p><p>The older man cleared his throat, his eyes seeming to darken.</p><p>&ldquo;Peter, have you ever given a thought to&hellip; therapy?&rdquo;</p><p>Peter tensed at the word.</p><p>Truth was, he <i>had </i>thought about it. He knew this whole <i>depression </i>thing was taking over his life, ruining everything - affecting every decision, his very <i>future</i>.</p><p>Some days, he thought seeing a therapist wasn&rsquo;t the worst idea. Maybe they <i>could </i>help. Maybe he could start <i>living </i>again.</p><p>Others, it seemed like the Worst Possible Thing. He was too far past saving. Nothing could be done. Plus, seeing a therapist was <i>so </i>expensive - what if Tony finally realized Peter wasn&rsquo;t worth it? And also, if that wasn&rsquo;t enough, who knew if he&rsquo;d even be able to <i>speak </i>to a therapist?</p><p><i>What&rsquo;s bothering you?</i></p><p><i>I&rsquo;m depressed, but not depressed-depressed, because sometimes I&rsquo;m really sad and other times I&rsquo;m not, and I have no reason to be so I guess it&rsquo;s not really true. And also, I&rsquo;m Spiderman, which I&rsquo;m not supposed to tell you, and I see civilians die, like, once a week, maybe? Also, my Uncle Ben died in front of my eyes when I was younger, my parents even before that, but I got used to it and I was fine until my Aunt died too. I was trapped under a building, my crush&rsquo;s dad tried to kill me, and also I&rsquo;m shoved against lockers every day by bullies because I&rsquo;m only a high school freshman. What&rsquo;s up with you?</i></p><p>Yeah, that would go over well.</p><p>&ldquo;Any thoughts?&rdquo;</p><p><i>Oh</i>, Peter realized with a start. Tony was still waiting on an answer.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, Mr. Stark,&rdquo; he said quietly, embarrassed. &ldquo;I mean, other people have it worse than me, right? Why would someone waste their time talking to me, a sort-of-sad-but-maybe-it&rsquo;s-just-teen-angst kid, when they could be helping someone who <i>really </i>needs it?&rdquo;</p><p>Tony shot him a look that Peter recognized as something close to pity, but not quite.</p><p>&ldquo;Peter, you have <i>got </i>to give yourself credit sometimes. You almost-&rdquo; He had to stop himself. Breathe. Compose. Try again. &ldquo;You almost <i>killed </i>yourself, Peter. You deserve to get help. And even if you didn&rsquo;t, even if things had never gotten that extreme - damn it, Peter, you <i>deserve </i>to feel better. You don&rsquo;t deserve to feel anything less than perfect!&rdquo;</p><p>The tone of his voice didn&rsquo;t match the passionate fire of his words. It was sad, upset, ready to be overcome with tears at any given moment.</p><p>&ldquo;Please, Peter, let me help you.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter let out a dejected sigh.</p><p>&ldquo;For the record, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;ll help.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony didn&rsquo;t say anything.</p><p>&ldquo;And I really don&rsquo;t deserve it.&rdquo;</p><p>He looked like he wanted to interrupt, but was biting his tongue.</p><p>&ldquo;And it&rsquo;s really expensive-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about the money!&rdquo; he finally blurted, and Peter chuckled inwardly. Of course that was the one trigger, the one thing Tony spoke out on, that he made sure wasn&rsquo;t an issue - the one thing he had easy control over.</p><p>With one final, heavy sigh, Peter closed his eyes, sure he was going to regret what he said.</p><p>&ldquo;Fine. I&rsquo;ll go to therapy.&rdquo;</p><p>His sinking heart was immediately lifted when he heard the - the <i>giggle </i>from&hellip; <i>Tony Stark</i>?</p><p>&ldquo;Did you just-&rdquo; he let his eyes flutter open for emphasis- &ldquo;<i>giggle</i>?&rdquo;</p><p>Tony clamped a hand over his widely-grinning mouth.</p><p>&ldquo;Did I just win an argument against the most stubborn kid in the world?&rdquo;</p><p>Peter rolled his eyes. <i>Gosh</i>, his dad was a dork. He was going to be stuck with him forever, wasn&rsquo;t he?</p><p>Peter opened his arms once more, and the two collapsed into a hug of comfort, and protection - of safety, and love.</p><p>Of family.</p><p>&#10719;<b> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b><i>One week later &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>&#10719;</p><p>As the car pulled up outside of the modest-looking two storey, Peter wanted nothing more than to sink down into his seat and never resurface.</p><p>The first day of therapy.</p><p>He&rsquo;d be lying if he said a small, miniscule part of him wasn&rsquo;t excited. It was a chance to heal himself, restore him to what he used to be.</p><p>But a (much) larger part of himself was <i>terrified</i>.</p><p>What if the therapist knocked down a wall Peter forgot he had up? Brought forward some terrible memories that just made this whole <i>life </i>thing worse?</p><p>Peter had finally gotten semi-control over himself - what if all his progress was ruined for Tony&rsquo;s want for Peter&rsquo;s recovery to be professional?</p><p>&ldquo;I mean, what qualifies someone as a professional, anyways?&rdquo; Peter continued the argument aloud as Tony started exiting the car. Peter stayed put. &ldquo;Shouldn&rsquo;t <i>I </i>be trusted to heal <i>myself</i>? I mean, I know me best. She doesn&rsquo;t know anything about me.&rdquo; Tony had prepped Peter on the way over. His therapist was someone Tony had found after hours of thorough Google searches - someone named Adrienne.</p><p>Tony just rolled his eyes and said a quick, &ldquo;Come on, Spiderbaby. Get out of the car,&rdquo; before slamming the door and crossing his arms and tapping his foot, acting impatient. (Peter knew Tony really had all the time in the world for him.)</p><p>Peter sighed, getting out of the car and closing the door behind him.</p><p>&ldquo;I mean, really,&rdquo; he tried one final attempt (though he knew it was futile) to derail Tony as he locked the door behind him and they began to ascend the few steps leading up to the house. &ldquo;I should be trusted to know myself!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Be quiet and go talk about your feelings, and if I don&rsquo;t see any tears by the time I pick you up,&rdquo; Tony &lsquo;threatened&rsquo; with gritted teeth, ringing the doorbell. He slung an arm around Peter&rsquo;s shoulders and shook him lightly, giving him a comforting smile before the door opened.</p><p>&#10719;</p><p>Peter exited the house an hour later, looking surprisingly&hellip; unaffected. Tony was waiting for him in the car, typing away on his Starkpad, but he looked up at the first sign of movement, quickly exiting the car and skipping steps to reach where Peter was just stepping over the threshold, pulling the door shut behind him.</p><p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;d it go, bud?&rdquo; he asked lightly, ruffling the kid&rsquo;s hair. Peter gently pushed his hand away, but Tony knew it was only because they were in public. He <i>loved </i>when Tony played with his hair.</p><p>&ldquo;Actually&hellip; <i>okay</i>.&rdquo; Peter looked confused at the lack of horrible, life-changing events, and Tony finally allowed himself to smirk, knowing the kid couldn&rsquo;t see him.</p><p>He hadn&rsquo;t told a <i>complete </i>lie; he <i>had </i>spent hours searching online for the perfect therapist, but not for Peter, for <i>himself</i>, and not over the past week, either. Really, he had been going to Adrienne biweekly since New York (though Peter being younger would be going weekly). And she had been a <i>huge </i>help.</p><p>Tony wasn&rsquo;t really hiding it, per se; he just didn&rsquo;t feel like anyone needed to know. Maybe he&rsquo;d tell Peter later, but for now, he wanted Peter to think Tony was someone stable for him to lean on. (He didn&rsquo;t realize the thought of someone Peter trusted going through the same thing as him would help him come to terms with it - or maybe Tony did. Maybe Tony was scared to be open about his weaknesses, but really, who was to tell?)</p><p>&ldquo;What did you guys talk about? If you don&rsquo;t mind me asking,&rdquo; Tony asked as they reached the car, pulling the door open for Peter to climb in, before jogging to the other side to get in himself.</p><p>&ldquo;She just asked me about what I liked to do and stuff. We talked about Brooklyn Nine-Nine for a solid 20 minutes. Turns out she likes the show, too.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony bit back his smile. During <i>his </i>first session, they had talked about cars. Adrienne had known a surprising amount - her niece was a mechanic, too, and taught her enough to keep up with everything Tony was talking about, which was no easy feat. That was when Tony knew she was perfect for him - and would be for Peter, too.</p><p>&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t do any actual <i>talking </i>stuff,&rdquo; Peter muttered, almost to himself, and Tony knew he was trying to figure out why. Was it a scheme, or was she actually just the fraud he had suspected?</p><p>The next week&rsquo;s session seemed to answer his question.</p><p>Tony immediately knew this night would be different from last week&rsquo;s when Peter slouched out of the house, eyes trained on the floor, feet dragging on the pavement. Tony was ready for him as soon as he came out.</p><p>&ldquo;A bit harder today?&rdquo; he asked quietly when they were safely inside the car, driving home. Peter nodded, but didn&rsquo;t say anything more. Tony let the answer they were both expecting hang in the air for a moment before voicing it.</p><p>&ldquo;Want to talk about it?&rdquo;</p><p>Peter shook his head, which Tony was expecting. Instead, he wrapped the kid in his fluffiest blanket as soon as the pair got home, and they fell asleep on the couch watching Brooklyn Nine-Nine reruns. They didn&rsquo;t talk about the sessions, or what Peter was thinking, and Tony didn&rsquo;t question it.</p><p>He knew Peter would come to him if there was something he wanted to say.</p><p>There was no telling what each session would bring. Some were better than others.</p><p>Some days, Peter came bounding down the stone steps, the living embodiment of sunshine.</p><p>Others, he barely had the strength to stagger down the stairs without collapsing. Tony would be there for him the entire way, supporting him without a question, knowing two bowls of ice cream and unlimited blankets were awaiting them at home.</p><p>Days, in general, were unpredictable. Tony could usually tell from the get-go what kind of day Peter was going to have. He was either smiling, or could barely get out of bed.</p><p>On the good days, Tony smiled back. Made him pancakes, ruffled his hair, did anything in his power to keep it that way.</p><p>On the bad days, Peter would barely have the strength to get out of bed - but Tony would never leave his side then, either. He would say encouraging words, help guide him out the door. Send him encouraging messages throughout the school day for the kid to read during lunch, or between periods. (Peter would be lying if he said they didn&rsquo;t help, even just a tad.)</p><p>But there were other days where Tony just couldn&rsquo;t tell.</p><p>Peter woke up wearing a smile that Tony saw straight through, feeling, for whatever reason, that he needed to mask what he was feeling. Tony would encourage him to open up, even offer to sign him out of school for the day if he was being relentless. Tony didn&rsquo;t want that wall coming down mid-school day and having Peter upset surrounded by his peers. He knew how difficult a bunch of pubescent kids could be.</p><p>Other days, Peter woke up one way and came home from school the other. It was always a pleasant surprise when he came home smiling after seeming so miserable just that morning; but at other times, if something had happened at school to tarnish Peter&rsquo;s positive morning attitude, Tony just held him close and promised him it would be okay.</p><p>It took a while for that promise to actually come to life.</p><p>Peter expected to feel better within the first few weeks of therapy. When he didn&rsquo;t, the month. Then, the season. And, upsettingly, he didn&rsquo;t even feel one hundred percent back by the end of the year.</p><p>But he <i>did </i>feel better.</p><p>The thoughts in Peter&rsquo;s mind weren&rsquo;t as dark as they once had been. He didn&rsquo;t associate a bridge with jumping, a body of water with drowning. An incorrect answer in school didn&rsquo;t start a whirlwind of negative thoughts.</p><p>Of course, there were still bad days where Peter woke up in the morning and just&hellip; didn&rsquo;t feel like moving. And it sucked. He knew that no matter what happened, no matter what Tony tried to do to help him (and he tried a lot), the day was just a waste.</p><p>But he went to bed, and woke up the next morning with a fresh new attitude, and hoped that this day would be better than the last.</p><p>Peter wasn&rsquo;t feeling perfect, but he was feeling better.</p><p>And maybe that was enough.</p>",

        "body": "<p><b><i>Warning: this story is based heavily around suicide, including suicidal thoughts and attempts. Please be careful!! &lt;3</i></b></p><hr><p>The walk back to the tower went even slower than the walk to the park. Tony had his arm slung lazily over Peter\u2019s shoulders as the two slowly admired the buildings around them - <i>the city of New York </i>- but Peter couldn\u2019t say he didn\u2019t notice Tony\u2019s arm tighten around him whenever the pair crossed the street, or got too near a body of water.</p><p>As if Tony thought he would jump in front of a car or into the lake at a moment\u2019s notice.</p><p>Peter <i>had </i>been feeling relaxed as soon as he got his thoughts off his chest, but the way Tony was acting now just made him tense once again. There was a kind of fear and protectiveness radiating off Tony, and Peter sighed internally when he realized this feeling wasn\u2019t going to go away any time soon.</p><!-- more --><p>As Tony\u2019s fingers clenched tighter around Peter\u2019s shoulders as they stood waiting at a crosswalk, Peter wondered if he made a mistake telling Tony. He\u2019d been doing well thus far - he\u2019d been <i>surviving </i>- he could\u2019ve continued on like that. Maybe healed <i>himself</i>. Tony would have never had to know.</p><p>Know about the <i>war </i>raging in his head.</p><p>The thoughts that never gave him a break.</p><p>Suddenly, the dark cloud returned to swallow Peter, bringing forward thoughts, <i>feelings</i>, that Peter had grown used to over the last few months - but that didn\u2019t make them any less scary.</p><p>Peter was suddenly glad Tony was holding on to him so tightly. The <i>jump-in-front-of-a-car</i> idea didn\u2019t seem so bad anymore.</p><p>They reached the compound in silence, Peter now <i>convinced </i>that telling Tony was the wrong choice. He didn\u2019t need to burden Tony with this - he was <i>fine</i>. He could deal with it. He <i>had </i>been dealing with it.</p><p>What a burden he was.</p><p>Tony pulled open the door to the tower and let Peter walk in first, who kept his head down and avoided eye contact as he crossed the threshold and immediately started to walk upstairs to his bedroom. Shut the door behind him, blast music through his headphones, and pretend that <i>nightmare </i>had never occured.</p><p>Such a horrible, horrible decision.</p><p>Why on <i>earth</i> had he decided to tell Tony?</p><p>He was positive he would never look at Peter the same way again.</p><p>\u201cPeter?\u201d Tony\u2019s voice stopped Peter on the second step and he turned back around warily. Tony nodded his head to the kitchen. \u201cCome sit with me for a second.\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s heart dropped to his shoes as Tony let the way to the kitchen table. They were going to <i>talk</i>.</p><p>What questions was Tony going to ask? More importantly, how should Peter answer so Tony knew he wasn\u2019t lying, but also dulled down enough to prevent him being thrown into a mental asylum?</p><p>The two took a seat across each other at the round table, Peter sitting rigidly with his hands in his lap, looking everywhere in the room but at the man who was staring intently at him. Peter refused to look him in the eye. He didn\u2019t know what he would see if he looked - disappointment, disgust, anger - but he knew it wouldn\u2019t be good.</p><p>\u201cPeter.\u201d Peter hummed in recognition, eyes settling on the table somewhere between them. \u201cLook at me, please.\u201d</p><p>Peter groaned inwardly as he slowly brought his eyes up to meet Tony\u2019s.</p><p>The older man was leaning forward, his arms folded lightly on the table in front of him, eyes squinting like Peter was just another piece of machinery to figure out, the lack of <i>emotion</i> shocking Peter, whose own eyes were being heated with unshed tears.</p><p><i>Why </i>did he tell Tony? There was a reason he hadn\u2019t told anyone before. There was a <i>reason </i>he kept this to himself. He didn\u2019t want to deal with <i>this</i>. The conversations, the tears, the questions of <i>why </i>and <i>how long</i>.</p><p>So he was confused when Tony didn\u2019t do any of the following, instead opting for:</p><p>\u201cYou want to play Monopoly?\u201d</p><p>Apparently the surprise was evident on Peter\u2019s face, because Tony just raised an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cIs that a \u2018no\u2019? I have other board games.\u201d</p><p>Peter took a minute to gather his thoughts.</p><p>Where was the heart-to-heart conversation? Why wasn\u2019t Tony addressing the situation?</p><p>Nevertheless, Peter nodded quickly and cleared his throat.</p><p>\u201cUm, no. No, Monopoly\u2019s great.\u201d</p><p>Five minutes later, after the game was set up on the table, the money being divided evenly and houses organized in colour-coordinated piles. For some reason Tony insisted on the two of them travelling to the other room to get the game <i>together </i>even though he <i>knew </i>Peter knows where it was, but Peter tried to shrug off the feeling as they started to play the game.</p><p>About half way through Peter pushed back the chair and started to get up from the table when Tony stopped him suddenly.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019re you going, squirt?\u201d</p><p>Peter cocked his head at the nickname.</p><p>\u201cSquirt? You haven\u2019t called me that since I was ten.\u201d</p><p>Tony, who would\u2019ve <i>loved </i>to make fun of Peter about \u2018how cute he looked\u2019 at a time like this, looked strangely serious, waiting for an answer.</p><p>\u201cJust to the bathroom,\u201d Peter answered slowly. <i>Why was he being so serious?</i></p><p>Tony nodded with a faint smile and Peter rose from the table and began walking down the hall when he heard Tony say something from behind him. He turned suddenly.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Tony shook his head innocently.</p><p>\u201cNothin.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Suddenly, F.R.I.D.A.Y.\u2019s voice echoed through the room.</p><p>\u201c<i>All windows are locked</i>.\u201d</p><p>Peter squinted his eyes at Tony, who looked like someone had just found out his secret.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you just do?\u201d Peter asked, but Tony just smiled sweetly. Peter saw right through it.</p><p>\u201cNothing, bud, now <i>go</i>.\u201d Then, sounding forced, \u201cIf you come back fast enough, I\u2019ll <i>maybe </i>not steal your money.\u201d</p><p>Peter wanted to smile at the joke, but it sounded like Tony didn\u2019t really mean it. Like he was forcing himself to make conversation light. He just shrugged and turned back around, entering the bathroom, and locking the door behind him.</p><p>When Peter reentered the kitchen, something was\u2026 different. He couldn\u2019t place it.</p><p>His money was still in place, he noticed when he sat down, and Tony was still sitting at the table, drumming his fingers absentmindedly against the pair of die, so Peter just decided to shrug it off and continue the game.</p><p>\u201cYour move,\u201d Tony said when Peter settled, tossing the die over the board. Peter tried to ignore the unsettled feeling in his stomach as he finished the game.</p><p>\u29df</p><p>Tony won the game by a longshot. He tried to dull down the business man in him for Peter\u2019s sake, but he couldn\u2019t help it, analyzing every decision before he made it. Peter didn\u2019t seem bothered though, laughing every time Tony took a wad of paper money from him.</p><p>Though, something was <i>off </i>about how serious Tony was. He wasn\u2019t laughing whenever the die fell off the table as a result of Peter not being able to control his strength, or when Peter made a <i>terribly </i>awful move and almost went bankrupt. He looked like he barely even cared about the game, his eyes on Peter practically the whole time.</p><p>Finally, after they had the board and all corresponding pieces packed up, Peter starting heading back towards the stairs. He didn\u2019t feel as upset anymore, but he <i>did </i>have a biology test coming up to study for.</p><p>But again, Tony called him back.</p><p>\u201cWhat, bored of me already?\u201d</p><p>Peter turned back around to where Tony had just stood from the table and was looking at him with a look he couldn\u2019t quite identify. Was it fear, or concern? He was trying to mask it with humour, but Peter had been living with him for enough time to see straight through it.</p><p>Though, Peter couldn\u2019t <i>quite </i>identify what was underneath, so he couldn\u2019t call Tony out on it <i>just </i>yet.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you have in mind?\u201d</p><p>Tony hesitated for a moment, and Peter realized he didn\u2019t know himself. For some reason, he just wanted to keep Peter with him. Normally, that would be fine by Peter, but after the conversation they just had, Peter knew Tony meant something behind it.</p><p>He just couldn\u2019t figure out what.</p><p>\u201cWhat about a movie?\u201d Tony suggested suddenly, pointing to the flat screen t.v. through the wide, open-concept doorway.</p><p>\u201cMr. Stark, it\u2019s three o\u2019clock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrooklyn Nine-Nine marathon, then? You like that show, right?\u201d</p><p>Peter stared at him for a moment more before caving in and shrugging.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I guess.\u201d</p><p>Tony\u2019s face broke out in a tight-lipped but not reserved smile as he walked around the table, laid an arm across Peter\u2019s shoulders, and led him into the living room and onto a couch, the arm not moving as he reached over to grab the remote from the nearby coffee table and handing it to Peter.</p><p>The unsettled feeling sinking deeper into Peter\u2019s bones, he flipped through the dozens of extra options on Tony\u2019s large t.v. before settling on the one that played the desired show, and sat back as the characters started talking about Dianne Wiest.</p><p>\u29df</p><p>Two hours and six episodes later, Peter was getting antsy. Tony hadn\u2019t moved his arm from Peter\u2019s shoulders for the last 120 minutes, and he kept looking at Peter as if worried he would disappear from right under Tony\u2019s nose.</p><p>As soon as their sixth episode came to a close, Peter started to adjust himself on the couch. He sensed an argument begin to rise from Tony, so he spoke first.</p><p>\u201cI have a biology test to study for,\u201d he tried to explain, but Tony laid a hand on his arm (albeit a gentle one), holding him back.</p><p>\u201cI can help you study,\u201d he offered, but Peter just shook his head and shrugged it off. Honestly, it was getting kind of creepy how Tony wouldn\u2019t let Peter go. It was as if he was worried about what would happen if Peter left his eyesight.</p><p>And Peter finally thought he knew why.</p><p>\u201cIs there a villain after you or something?\u201d Peter asked suddenly turning so he was facing Tony. The man\u2019s face fell into one of confusion and slight disbelief, and he looked taken aback by the statement. He shook his head quickly.</p><p>\u201cNo, why? Are you worried about something?\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s eyes squinted accusingly.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t let me out of your sight, like something\u2019s lurking around the corner, and you\u2019re scared it\u2019ll get me if you let me go.\u201d</p><p>Tony\u2019s expression fell into one of relief and he sat back on the couch.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing like that, Pete,\u201d he said, his voice more relaxed and light - though there was still an undertone Peter couldn\u2019t quite identify.</p><p>\u201cThen why won\u2019t you let me go anywhere unless you\u2019re with me?\u201d Peter was being relentless. Tony had never struck him as a \u201chelicopter parent\u201d. Sure, he liked to keep a close eye on Peter,but that was just being a concerned parent. <i>This </i>was something different.</p><p>\u201cI just want to spend time with you, Petey,\u201d he chuckled, reaching a hand out to ruffle his curls, and Peter found himself leaning into the touch. \u201cI feel like I haven\u2019t spent time with you in awhile.\u201d</p><p>Peter nodded suddenly. Yeah, that made sense.</p><p>\u201cBut don\u2019t you have important <i>Stark Industries </i>stuff to do?\u201d He said the company name like it was something large and intimidating to be feared, and Tony laughed at the sentiment behind it.</p><p>\u201cIt can wait for a night. I\u2019m spending time with my kid. Everything else can wait.\u201d</p><p>For the first time that day, it didn\u2019t feel like Tony was hiding anything when he spoke to Peter. That line sounded genuinely, one hundred percent honest, and Peter finally felt himself thaw at the words. He smiled, finally allowing it to comfortably reach his eyes, and he collapsed back on the couch, leaning into Tony\u2019s side.</p><p>Tony pressed \u201cPlay\u201d on the remote, allowing the next episode to play, which Peter was too focused on to see the way Tony closed his eyes in relief, before looking down at his kid, sadness haunting his features.</p><p>\u29df</p><p>This was the longest t.v. marathon the two had ever had, finally ending somewhere around nine. Tony had gotten up from the couch half way through to make the pair a fruit and vegetable platter, and Peter was too engrossed in the show to notice that the man\u2019s worried eyes never left him once.</p><p>Finally, the credits for their last episode played, and Tony finally reached over and shut off the t.v. Peter sat up groggily and ran a tired hand over his eyes, checking the time on his phone and almost jumping in surprise.</p><p>\u201cThat was <i>six hours</i>?\u201d he exclaimed, and Tony chuckled at his response.</p><p>\u201cTime flies when you\u2019re spending time with the awesomest person in the world.\u201d</p><p>Peter frowned disapprovingly. \u201cMr. Stark, that\u2019s not a real word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is if I say it is. I\u2019m also the smartiest.\u201d</p><p>The improper grammar seemed to grate against Peter\u2019s ears.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re doing that on purpose!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre too!\u201d</p><p>Tony wanted to continue \u201carguing\u201d with his kid, but instead he found his face splitting into a smile he just couldn\u2019t contain. Within seconds the two were collapsed against each other, laughing in such a way they were crying and gasping for breath.</p><p>Peter had no idea why that was so funny. It was just a childish reaction. Maybe it was because they were watching t.v. for six hours straight - they had become untethered from reality.</p><p>Finally, the laughter finally subsided, and Peter found himself curled up against Tony\u2019s side, the older man running his fingers through his curls absentmindedly, when Peter finally yawned.</p><p>\u201cTired?\u201d</p><p>Peter nodded into Tony\u2019s hand, and Tony smiled at the feeling of his kid against his chest, living. <i>Breathing</i>.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you head off to bed, then?\u201d he spoke softly, glad the kid was finally tired. It meant he could sleep, and nothing could hurt him when he was asleep.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t hurt <i>himself </i>when he was asleep.</p><p>Peter groggily stood from the couch, letting out a breath at the action of untangling himself from the position he had been sitting in for so long. He waved loosely in Tony\u2019s general direction, hearing a laugh from the man that made him smile before climbing up the stairs.</p><p>He thought he heard a few words being spoken from behind him when he was halfway up the stairs, but they were too quiet to be directed at him, so he ignored them, instead choosing to stumble into his room and collapse on his bed.</p><p>He was out like a light.</p><p>\u29df</p><p>Peter woke earlier than normal the next morning. A look at his clock said it was six-thirty, making his eyebrows raise in surprise.</p><p><i>That\u2019s what going to bed early will get you</i>, he thought to himself as he sat up and yawned, stretching his arms over his head. He wasn\u2019t even tired.</p><p><i>Over nine hours of sleep</i>, he thought approvingly. <i>I haven\u2019t slept that well since</i>-</p><p>Peter froze suddenly, legs dangling off his bed. Since before he had been thrown into this hole of darkness and despair and bad thoughts.</p><p><i>Nope</i>, he thought suddenly, pushing himself up to stand. <i>Not doing that today. I feel good. I\u2019m not going to start thinking about that</i>.</p><p>He got dressed, throwing on a simple pair of jeans and the first sweatshirt he found as well as the watch Tony had bought him on his twelfth birthday (was it heavier than usual?), before heading to his door - but stopping short.</p><p>It was closed.</p><p>It was <i>never </i>closed.</p><p>Peter didn\u2019t like when his door was closed. He found it suffocating. Even though his room in the tower was quite large, the door made it feel abnormally small, closing him in, burying him in darkness.</p><p>He reached for the doorknob to pull it open, but F.R.I.D.A.Y.\u2019s voice almost made him jump out of his skin.</p><p>\u201c<i>Mr. Stark wouldn\u2019t like you to leave your room until seven a.m.</i>\u201d</p><p>Peter froze.</p><p><i>What?</i></p><p>He had a curfew. No Spiderman-ing past ten. There was never a set time for him to <i>sleep in </i>in the morning.</p><p>\u201cWhen did he say this?\u201d he called out quietly to the empty room. (He had grown used to speaking comfortably to the open air since moving in.)</p><p>\u201c<i>Last night.</i>\u201d</p><p>Oh. <i>That\u2019s </i>what he had been saying to himself.</p><p>\u201c<i>Mr. Stark has asked me to alert him if you left your room beforehand</i>.\u201d</p><p>A look at Peter\u2019s alarm clock told him it was six forty-five. He sighed as he moved to sit on his bed. He could wait until seven. He didn\u2019t want to alarm Tony.</p><p>\u201cDo you know why, Fri?\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>I\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t, Peter.</i>\u201d</p><p>Peter squinted his eyes as he sat staring at the wall. Why did Tony care what he did in the morning?</p><p>\u201cIs Mr. Stark awake yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Not yet, Peter.</i>\u201d</p><p>Peter thought for a moment.</p><p>\u201cDo you have to tell Mr. Stark?\u201d</p><p>F.R.I.D.A.Y. was quiet for a minute.</p><p>\u201c<i>Why do you want to leave your room?</i>\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just want to get ready for school. Eat breakfast, and stuff. Y\u2019know?\u201d What else would he be doing? What was Tony <i>afraid </i>of?</p><p>F.R.I.D.A.Y. hesitated again, before, \u201c<i>Okay Peter, you may go. I won\u2019t alert Mr. Stark.</i>\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Fri,\u201d Peter responded, opening his door and heading down the stairs, his mind racing.</p><p>Why didn\u2019t Mr. Stark want him leaving his room?</p><p>He shook off the weird feeling that seemed to follow him (he found himself doing that a lot lately) as he headed into the kitchen. Peter grabbed the loaf of bread from the fridge, took out four slices, and placed them in the toaster oven. He might as well make Mr. Stark breakfast, too, since he was up so early, even if he <i>was </i>being an annoying helicopter parent.</p><p>Peter grabbed two plates and set them down on the table while waiting for the toast to, well, <i>toast</i>, before taking the butter from the fridge and setting it down beside the plates. Then, he moved to the drawer beside the stove to get a knife.</p><p>Because that\u2019s where the knives <i>used </i>to be.</p><p>But they weren\u2019t there now.</p><p>Peter stared in confusion at the empty drawer. Had they gotten robbed by a knife-collector?</p><p>He checked the other drawers where the other utensils were kept. Forks were still there; spoons, too.</p><p>But not knives.</p><p>\u201cF.R.I.D.A.Y.?\u201d Peter called out for the second time that morning.</p><p>\u201c<i>Yes, Peter?</i>\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are the knives?\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>In a box above the fridge</i>.\u201d</p><p>Peter froze suddenly. <i>In a box above the fridge? </i>What the heck?</p><p>He stood up on his tiptoes to peek on top of the fridge. Sure enough, there was a wicker basket there Peter was <i>positive </i>hadn\u2019t existed before. He sighed to himself as he pushed himself up onto the countertop to be able to reach the box on top. He was almost there when he heard an exclamation from behind him.</p><p>\u201cPeter, what the fuck? Get down from there!\u201d</p><p>Peter almost toppled but caught himself at the last second, stabilizing himself against the top of the fridge before looking sharply down at Tony.</p><p>\u201cWhy are the knives up here?\u201d</p><p>Tony\u2019s face flushed bright red. Peter continued to reach for the box and Tony\u2019s eyes widened as if that was the Worst Possible Thing that he could\u2019ve done.</p><p>\u201c<i>Don\u2019t touch them.</i>\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s hand froze inches from the nearest handle, the pure <i>fear </i>in Tony\u2019s voice striking him off guard. He looked down at Tony, shocked, to see him with an arm reached out to Peter, eyes pleading.</p><p>\u201cJust - come down from there, <i>please</i>.\u201d</p><p>Peter quickly climbed down from the countertop. He wasn\u2019t sure <i>what </i>was bothering Tony, but it was seriously affecting him, and Peter knew better than to challenge Tony when he had that look in his eyes - when the cool, suave billionaire was <i>pleading</i>.</p><p>He jumped down from the counter, holding his hands up, palms out, when he finally touched ground.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said quietly. He wasn\u2019t sure what had upset Tony, but the man was looking so serious, Peter unquestionably wanted to put an immediate end to\u2026 <i>whatever </i>it was.</p><p>Tony leaned against the counter, looking exhausted, watching Peter warily. Finally, he spoke.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing up so early?\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s eyes suddenly grew hard at the reminder of his early interaction with F.R.I.D.A.Y.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you want to keep me in my room?\u201d</p><p>Tony brought a hand to the bridge of his nose as he sighed deeply, closing his eyes.</p><p>\u201cShe wasn\u2019t supposed to let you out,\u201d he muttered, almost to himself - but Peter heard it clearly.</p><p>\u201c<i>Why?</i>\u201d he challenged, his voice hard. \u201cWhy are you monitoring me so closely?\u201d He crossed his arms over his chest, suddenly feeling\u2026 <i>angry</i>. Very angry at how <i>controlling </i>Tony was being. Peter was <i>fifteen</i>. He knew he wasn\u2019t an adult yet. He understood he still had a long way to go, still needed to be monitored. But he <i>should </i>be allowed to go to another room unsupervised. Go to the bathroom without needing the windows to be locked beforehand. (What <i>was </i>that, anyway?) He should be trusted to wake up as early as he wanted, and <i>use knives</i>. He wasn\u2019t an adult yet, sure, but he wasn\u2019t a <i>child</i>.</p><p>Tony looked exhausted. Peter wanted to feel bad for him, wanted to feel worried, but Tony had been treating him like he was a <i>toddler</i>. Until he heard the truth, he wasn\u2019t letting up.</p><p>Tony took a while to speak, finally raising his head to look Peter in his eyes - and Peter wanted to take a step back at the raw emotion he saw there, at the red-rimmed, hopeless, tear-ridden eyes, but he stood strong.</p><p>He was getting an explanation.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m worried about you,\u201d he muttered, and Peter\u2019s eyes softened, his arms falling loosely to his side. His heart seemed to cave in on itself with every word his dad spoke. \u201cYou scared me, kiddo.\u201d He tilted his head, and Peter\u2019s heart skipped a beat when he realized Tony Stark was\u2026 <i>crying</i>?</p><p>And <i>he </i>was the cause of it.</p><p><i>Why </i>did Peter tell Tony?</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to lose you.\u201d Tony whispered that last line, and that was when Peter\u2019s heart finally shattered. He stumbled forwards to wrap his arms around his dad, though the arrangement they had was more so Tony hugging Peter.</p><p>He clutched an arm tightly around his kid\u2019s back, a hand threading through his curls, as Peter buried his face in his dad\u2019s chest. He listened to the sound of his heart beating faster than it should\u2019ve been as they held each other tightly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201d</p><p>Tony just tightened his hold.</p><p>\u201cYou almost did,\u201d Tony muttered, rubbing circles onto Peter\u2019s back, and Peter tensed at the reminder.</p><p>He <i>hated </i>that he was hurting his dad like this. How could he explain that he didn\u2019t feel like he had a choice? That it felt as though everything was crashing down on him, crushing him from the inside? That everything was going wrong and it felt like nothing would ever go right again?</p><p>That if he lived another minute he felt like he would fade to nothing&hellip;</p><p>and no one would care?</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019d you want to keep me in my room?\u201d Peter mumbled into Tony\u2019s chest, eyes partially closed, feeling safe and comforted in his dad\u2019s arms. Tony took a while to respond.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know if you would try to\u2026.\u201d Tony sighed deeply before finding the word. \u201c<i>Leave</i>.\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s breath hitched in his throat. Why Tony didn\u2019t want to let him out of his sight. Why he was hesitant to leave him alone. He wasn\u2019t scared of what others would do to Peter\u2026</p><p>he was scared of what Peter would do to <i>himself</i>.</p><p>Peter found himself too shocked - too ashamed, too <i>upset</i>, to respond, so Tony continued.</p><p>\u201cYou mean so much to me, Peter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop.\u201d Peter couldn\u2019t stand to hear this speech. This guilt-inducing, tear-jerking speech.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t stand to lose you.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Stop</i>.\u201d Why wasn\u2019t Tony <i>listening</i>? Didn\u2019t he know guilt would only make it worse?</p><p>\u201cIf you died-\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Tony</i>,\u201d the strangled sob wracked its way through Peter\u2019s throat before he even registered the word, <i>begging </i>him to stop, but the man continued as if Peter hadn\u2019t even spoken.</p><p>\u201c<i>If you died</i>,\u201d he repeated louder as if to drown Peter out, \u201cyou know I would follow.\u201d</p>",

He\u2019d been doing well thus far - he\u2019d been <i>surviving </i>- he could\u2019ve continued on like that. Maybe healed <i>himself</i>. Tony would have never had to know.</p><p>Know about the <i>war </i>raging in his head.</p><p>The thoughts that never gave him a break.</p><p>Suddenly, the dark cloud returned to swallow Peter, bringing forward thoughts, <i>feelings</i>, that Peter had grown used to over the last few months - but that didn\u2019t make them any less scary.</p><p>Peter was suddenly glad Tony was holding on to him so tightly. The <i>jump-in-front-of-a-car</i> idea didn\u2019t seem so bad anymore.</p><p>They reached the compound in silence, Peter now <i>convinced </i>that telling Tony was the wrong choice. He didn\u2019t need to burden Tony with this - he was <i>fine</i>. He could deal with it. He <i>had </i>been dealing with it.</p><p>What a burden he was.</p><p>Tony pulled open the door to the tower and let Peter walk in first, who kept his head down and avoided eye contact as he crossed the threshold and immediately started to walk upstairs to his bedroom. Shut the door behind him, blast music through his headphones, and pretend that <i>nightmare </i>had never occured.</p><p>Such a horrible, horrible decision.</p><p>Why on <i>earth</i> had he decided to tell Tony?</p><p>He was positive he would never look at Peter the same way again.</p><p>\u201cPeter?\u201d Tony\u2019s voice stopped Peter on the second step and he turned back around warily. Tony nodded his head to the kitchen. \u201cCome sit with me for a second.\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s heart dropped to his shoes as Tony let the way to the kitchen table. They were going to <i>talk</i>.</p><p>What questions was Tony going to ask? More importantly, how should Peter answer so Tony knew he wasn\u2019t lying, but also dulled down enough to prevent him being thrown into a mental asylum?</p><p>The two took a seat across each other at the round table, Peter sitting rigidly with his hands in his lap, looking everywhere in the room but at the man who was staring intently at him. Peter refused to look him in the eye. He didn\u2019t know what he would see if he looked - disappointment, disgust, anger - but he knew it wouldn\u2019t be good.</p><p>\u201cPeter.\u201d Peter hummed in recognition, eyes settling on the table somewhere between them. \u201cLook at me, please.\u201d</p><p>Peter groaned inwardly as he slowly brought his eyes up to meet Tony\u2019s.</p><p>The older man was leaning forward, his arms folded lightly on the table in front of him, eyes squinting like Peter was just another piece of machinery to figure out, the lack of <i>emotion</i> shocking Peter, whose own eyes were being heated with unshed tears.</p><p><i>Why </i>did he tell Tony? There was a reason he hadn\u2019t told anyone before. There was a <i>reason </i>he kept this to himself. He didn\u2019t want to deal with <i>this</i>. The conversations, the tears, the questions of <i>why </i>and <i>how long</i>.</p><p>So he was confused when Tony didn\u2019t do any of the following, instead opting for:</p><p>\u201cYou want to play Monopoly?\u201d</p><p>Apparently the surprise was evident on Peter\u2019s face, because Tony just raised an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cIs that a \u2018no\u2019? I have other board games.\u201d</p><p>Peter took a minute to gather his thoughts.</p><p>Where was the heart-to-heart conversation? Why wasn\u2019t Tony addressing the situation?</p><p>Nevertheless, Peter nodded quickly and cleared his throat.</p><p>\u201cUm, no. No, Monopoly\u2019s great.\u201d</p><p>Five minutes later, after the game was set up on the table, the money being divided evenly and houses organized in colour-coordinated piles. For some reason Tony insisted on the two of them travelling to the other room to get the game <i>together </i>even though he <i>knew </i>Peter knows where it was, but Peter tried to shrug off the feeling as they started to play the game.</p><p>About half way through Peter pushed back the chair and started to get up from the table when Tony stopped him suddenly.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019re you going, squirt?\u201d</p><p>Peter cocked his head at the nickname.</p><p>\u201cSquirt? You haven\u2019t called me that since I was ten.\u201d</p><p>Tony, who would\u2019ve <i>loved </i>to make fun of Peter about \u2018how cute he looked\u2019 at a time like this, looked strangely serious, waiting for an answer.</p><p>\u201cJust to the bathroom,\u201d Peter answered slowly. <i>Why was he being so serious?</i></p><p>Tony nodded with a faint smile and Peter rose from the table and began walking down the hall when he heard Tony say something from behind him. He turned suddenly.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Tony shook his head innocently.</p><p>\u201cNothin.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Suddenly, F.R.I.D.A.Y.\u2019s voice echoed through the room.</p><p>\u201c<i>All windows are locked</i>.\u201d</p><p>Peter squinted his eyes at Tony, who looked like someone had just found out his secret.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you just do?\u201d Peter asked, but Tony just smiled sweetly. Peter saw right through it.</p><p>\u201cNothing, bud, now <i>go</i>.\u201d Then, sounding forced, \u201cIf you come back fast enough, I\u2019ll <i>maybe </i>not steal your money.\u201d</p><p>Peter wanted to smile at the joke, but it sounded like Tony didn\u2019t really mean it. Like he was forcing himself to make conversation light. He just shrugged and turned back around, entering the bathroom, and locking the door behind him.</p><p>When Peter reentered the kitchen, something was\u2026 different. He couldn\u2019t place it.</p><p>His money was still in place, he noticed when he sat down, and Tony was still sitting at the table, drumming his fingers absentmindedly against the pair of die, so Peter just decided to shrug it off and continue the game.</p><p>\u201cYour move,\u201d Tony said when Peter settled, tossing the die over the board. Peter tried to ignore the unsettled feeling in his stomach as he finished the game.</p><p>\u29df</p><p>Tony won the game by a longshot. He tried to dull down the business man in him for Peter\u2019s sake, but he couldn\u2019t help it, analyzing every decision before he made it. Peter didn\u2019t seem bothered though, laughing every time Tony took a wad of paper money from him.</p><p>Though, something was <i>off </i>about how serious Tony was. He wasn\u2019t laughing whenever the die fell off the table as a result of Peter not being able to control his strength, or when Peter made a <i>terribly </i>awful move and almost went bankrupt. He looked like he barely even cared about the game, his eyes on Peter practically the whole time.</p><p>Finally, after they had the board and all corresponding pieces packed up, Peter starting heading back towards the stairs. He didn\u2019t feel as upset anymore, but he <i>did </i>have a biology test coming up to study for.</p><p>But again, Tony called him back.</p><p>\u201cWhat, bored of me already?\u201d</p><p>Peter turned back around to where Tony had just stood from the table and was looking at him with a look he couldn\u2019t quite identify. Was it fear, or concern? He was trying to mask it with humour, but Peter had been living with him for enough time to see straight through it.</p><p>Though, Peter couldn\u2019t <i>quite </i>identify what was underneath, so he couldn\u2019t call Tony out on it <i>just </i>yet.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you have in mind?\u201d</p><p>Tony hesitated for a moment, and Peter realized he didn\u2019t know himself. For some reason, he just wanted to keep Peter with him. Normally, that would be fine by Peter, but after the conversation they just had, Peter knew Tony meant something behind it.</p><p>He just couldn\u2019t figure out what.</p><p>\u201cWhat about a movie?\u201d Tony suggested suddenly, pointing to the flat screen t.v. through the wide, open-concept doorway.</p><p>\u201cMr. Stark, it\u2019s three o\u2019clock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrooklyn Nine-Nine marathon, then? You like that show, right?\u201d</p><p>Peter stared at him for a moment more before caving in and shrugging.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I guess.\u201d</p><p>Tony\u2019s face broke out in a tight-lipped but not reserved smile as he walked around the table, laid an arm across Peter\u2019s shoulders, and led him into the living room and onto a couch, the arm not moving as he reached over to grab the remote from the nearby coffee table and handing it to Peter.</p><p>The unsettled feeling sinking deeper into Peter\u2019s bones, he flipped through the dozens of extra options on Tony\u2019s large t.v. before settling on the one that played the desired show, and sat back as the characters started talking about Dianne Wiest.</p><p>\u29df</p><p>Two hours and six episodes later, Peter was getting antsy. Tony hadn\u2019t moved his arm from Peter\u2019s shoulders for the last 120 minutes, and he kept looking at Peter as if worried he would disappear from right under Tony\u2019s nose.</p><p>As soon as their sixth episode came to a close, Peter started to adjust himself on the couch. He sensed an argument begin to rise from Tony, so he spoke first.</p><p>\u201cI have a biology test to study for,\u201d he tried to explain, but Tony laid a hand on his arm (albeit a gentle one), holding him back.</p><p>\u201cI can help you study,\u201d he offered, but Peter just shook his head and shrugged it off. Honestly, it was getting kind of creepy how Tony wouldn\u2019t let Peter go. It was as if he was worried about what would happen if Peter left his eyesight.</p><p>And Peter finally thought he knew why.</p><p>\u201cIs there a villain after you or something?\u201d Peter asked suddenly turning so he was facing Tony. The man\u2019s face fell into one of confusion and slight disbelief, and he looked taken aback by the statement. He shook his head quickly.</p><p>\u201cNo, why? Are you worried about something?\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s eyes squinted accusingly.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t let me out of your sight, like something\u2019s lurking around the corner, and you\u2019re scared it\u2019ll get me if you let me go.\u201d</p><p>Tony\u2019s expression fell into one of relief and he sat back on the couch.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing like that, Pete,\u201d he said, his voice more relaxed and light - though there was still an undertone Peter couldn\u2019t quite identify.</p><p>\u201cThen why won\u2019t you let me go anywhere unless you\u2019re with me?\u201d Peter was being relentless. Tony had never struck him as a \u201chelicopter parent\u201d. Sure, he liked to keep a close eye on Peter,but that was just being a concerned parent. <i>This </i>was something different.</p><p>\u201cI just want to spend time with you, Petey,\u201d he chuckled, reaching a hand out to ruffle his curls, and Peter found himself leaning into the touch. \u201cI feel like I haven\u2019t spent time with you in awhile.\u201d</p><p>Peter nodded suddenly. Yeah, that made sense.</p><p>\u201cBut don\u2019t you have important <i>Stark Industries </i>stuff to do?\u201d He said the company name like it was something large and intimidating to be feared, and Tony laughed at the sentiment behind it.</p><p>\u201cIt can wait for a night. I\u2019m spending time with my kid. Everything else can wait.\u201d</p><p>For the first time that day, it didn\u2019t feel like Tony was hiding anything when he spoke to Peter. That line sounded genuinely, one hundred percent honest, and Peter finally felt himself thaw at the words. He smiled, finally allowing it to comfortably reach his eyes, and he collapsed back on the couch, leaning into Tony\u2019s side.</p><p>Tony pressed \u201cPlay\u201d on the remote, allowing the next episode to play, which Peter was too focused on to see the way Tony closed his eyes in relief, before looking down at his kid, sadness haunting his features.</p><p>\u29df</p><p>This was the longest t.v. marathon the two had ever had, finally ending somewhere around nine. Tony had gotten up from the couch half way through to make the pair a fruit and vegetable platter, and Peter was too engrossed in the show to notice that the man\u2019s worried eyes never left him once.</p><p>Finally, the credits for their last episode played, and Tony finally reached over and shut off the t.v. Peter sat up groggily and ran a tired hand over his eyes, checking the time on his phone and almost jumping in surprise.</p><p>\u201cThat was <i>six hours</i>?\u201d he exclaimed, and Tony chuckled at his response.</p><p>\u201cTime flies when you\u2019re spending time with the awesomest person in the world.\u201d</p><p>Peter frowned disapprovingly. \u201cMr. Stark, that\u2019s not a real word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is if I say it is. I\u2019m also the smartiest.\u201d</p><p>The improper grammar seemed to grate against Peter\u2019s ears.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re doing that on purpose!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre too!\u201d</p><p>Tony wanted to continue \u201carguing\u201d with his kid, but instead he found his face splitting into a smile he just couldn\u2019t contain. Within seconds the two were collapsed against each other, laughing in such a way they were crying and gasping for breath.</p><p>Peter had no idea why that was so funny. It was just a childish reaction. Maybe it was because they were watching t.v. for six hours straight - they had become untethered from reality.</p><p>Finally, the laughter finally subsided, and Peter found himself curled up against Tony\u2019s side, the older man running his fingers through his curls absentmindedly, when Peter finally yawned.</p><p>\u201cTired?\u201d</p><p>Peter nodded into Tony\u2019s hand, and Tony smiled at the feeling of his kid against his chest, living. <i>Breathing</i>.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you head off to bed, then?\u201d he spoke softly, glad the kid was finally tired. It meant he could sleep, and nothing could hurt him when he was asleep.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t hurt <i>himself </i>when he was asleep.</p><p>Peter groggily stood from the couch, letting out a breath at the action of untangling himself from the position he had been sitting in for so long. He waved loosely in Tony\u2019s general direction, hearing a laugh from the man that made him smile before climbing up the stairs.</p><p>He thought he heard a few words being spoken from behind him when he was halfway up the stairs, but they were too quiet to be directed at him, so he ignored them, instead choosing to stumble into his room and collapse on his bed.</p><p>He was out like a light.</p><p>\u29df</p><p>Peter woke earlier than normal the next morning. A look at his clock said it was six-thirty, making his eyebrows raise in surprise.</p><p><i>That\u2019s what going to bed early will get you</i>, he thought to himself as he sat up and yawned, stretching his arms over his head. He wasn\u2019t even tired.</p><p><i>Over nine hours of sleep</i>, he thought approvingly. <i>I haven\u2019t slept that well since</i>-</p><p>Peter froze suddenly, legs dangling off his bed. Since before he had been thrown into this hole of darkness and despair and bad thoughts.</p><p><i>Nope</i>, he thought suddenly, pushing himself up to stand. <i>Not doing that today. I feel good. I\u2019m not going to start thinking about that</i>.</p><p>He got dressed, throwing on a simple pair of jeans and the first sweatshirt he found as well as the watch Tony had bought him on his twelfth birthday (was it heavier than usual?), before heading to his door - but stopping short.</p><p>It was closed.</p><p>It was <i>never </i>closed.</p><p>Peter didn\u2019t like when his door was closed. He found it suffocating. Even though his room in the tower was quite large, the door made it feel abnormally small, closing him in, burying him in darkness.</p><p>He reached for the doorknob to pull it open, but F.R.I.D.A.Y.\u2019s voice almost made him jump out of his skin.</p><p>\u201c<i>Mr. Stark wouldn\u2019t like you to leave your room until seven a.m.</i>\u201d</p><p>Peter froze.</p><p><i>What?</i></p><p>He had a curfew. No Spiderman-ing past ten. There was never a set time for him to <i>sleep in </i>in the morning.</p><p>\u201cWhen did he say this?\u201d he called out quietly to the empty room. (He had grown used to speaking comfortably to the open air since moving in.)</p><p>\u201c<i>Last night.</i>\u201d</p><p>Oh. <i>That\u2019s </i>what he had been saying to himself.</p><p>\u201c<i>Mr. Stark has asked me to alert him if you left your room beforehand</i>.\u201d</p><p>A look at Peter\u2019s alarm clock told him it was six forty-five. He sighed as he moved to sit on his bed. He could wait until seven. He didn\u2019t want to alarm Tony.</p><p>\u201cDo you know why, Fri?\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>I\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t, Peter.</i>\u201d</p><p>Peter squinted his eyes as he sat staring at the wall. Why did Tony care what he did in the morning?</p><p>\u201cIs Mr. Stark awake yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Not yet, Peter.</i>\u201d</p><p>Peter thought for a moment.</p><p>\u201cDo you have to tell Mr. Stark?\u201d</p><p>F.R.I.D.A.Y. was quiet for a minute.</p><p>\u201c<i>Why do you want to leave your room?</i>\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just want to get ready for school. Eat breakfast, and stuff. Y\u2019know?\u201d What else would he be doing? What was Tony <i>afraid </i>of?</p><p>F.R.I.D.A.Y. hesitated again, before, \u201c<i>Okay Peter, you may go. I won\u2019t alert Mr. Stark.</i>\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Fri,\u201d Peter responded, opening his door and heading down the stairs, his mind racing.</p><p>Why didn\u2019t Mr. Stark want him leaving his room?</p><p>He shook off the weird feeling that seemed to follow him (he found himself doing that a lot lately) as he headed into the kitchen. Peter grabbed the loaf of bread from the fridge, took out four slices, and placed them in the toaster oven. He might as well make Mr. Stark breakfast, too, since he was up so early, even if he <i>was </i>being an annoying helicopter parent.</p><p>Peter grabbed two plates and set them down on the table while waiting for the toast to, well, <i>toast</i>, before taking the butter from the fridge and setting it down beside the plates. Then, he moved to the drawer beside the stove to get a knife.</p><p>Because that\u2019s where the knives <i>used </i>to be.</p><p>But they weren\u2019t there now.</p><p>Peter stared in confusion at the empty drawer. Had they gotten robbed by a knife-collector?</p><p>He checked the other drawers where the other utensils were kept. Forks were still there; spoons, too.</p><p>But not knives.</p><p>\u201cF.R.I.D.A.Y.?\u201d Peter called out for the second time that morning.</p><p>\u201c<i>Yes, Peter?</i>\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are the knives?\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>In a box above the fridge</i>.\u201d</p><p>Peter froze suddenly. <i>In a box above the fridge? </i>What the heck?</p><p>He stood up on his tiptoes to peek on top of the fridge. Sure enough, there was a wicker basket there Peter was <i>positive </i>hadn\u2019t existed before. He sighed to himself as he pushed himself up onto the countertop to be able to reach the box on top. He was almost there when he heard an exclamation from behind him.</p><p>\u201cPeter, what the fuck? Get down from there!\u201d</p><p>Peter almost toppled but caught himself at the last second, stabilizing himself against the top of the fridge before looking sharply down at Tony.</p><p>\u201cWhy are the knives up here?\u201d</p><p>Tony\u2019s face flushed bright red. Peter continued to reach for the box and Tony\u2019s eyes widened as if that was the Worst Possible Thing that he could\u2019ve done.</p><p>\u201c<i>Don\u2019t touch them.</i>\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s hand froze inches from the nearest handle, the pure <i>fear </i>in Tony\u2019s voice striking him off guard. He looked down at Tony, shocked, to see him with an arm reached out to Peter, eyes pleading.</p><p>\u201cJust - come down from there, <i>please</i>.\u201d</p><p>Peter quickly climbed down from the countertop. He wasn\u2019t sure <i>what </i>was bothering Tony, but it was seriously affecting him, and Peter knew better than to challenge Tony when he had that look in his eyes - when the cool, suave billionaire was <i>pleading</i>.</p><p>He jumped down from the counter, holding his hands up, palms out, when he finally touched ground.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said quietly. He wasn\u2019t sure what had upset Tony, but the man was looking so serious, Peter unquestionably wanted to put an immediate end to\u2026 <i>whatever </i>it was.</p><p>Tony leaned against the counter, looking exhausted, watching Peter warily. Finally, he spoke.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing up so early?\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s eyes suddenly grew hard at the reminder of his early interaction with F.R.I.D.A.Y.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you want to keep me in my room?\u201d</p><p>Tony brought a hand to the bridge of his nose as he sighed deeply, closing his eyes.</p><p>\u201cShe wasn\u2019t supposed to let you out,\u201d he muttered, almost to himself - but Peter heard it clearly.</p><p>\u201c<i>Why?</i>\u201d he challenged, his voice hard. \u201cWhy are you monitoring me so closely?\u201d He crossed his arms over his chest, suddenly feeling\u2026 <i>angry</i>. Very angry at how <i>controlling </i>Tony was being. Peter was <i>fifteen</i>. He knew he wasn\u2019t an adult yet. He understood he still had a long way to go, still needed to be monitored. But he <i>should </i>be allowed to go to another room unsupervised. Go to the bathroom without needing the windows to be locked beforehand. (What <i>was </i>that, anyway?) He should be trusted to wake up as early as he wanted, and <i>use knives</i>. He wasn\u2019t an adult yet, sure, but he wasn\u2019t a <i>child</i>.</p><p>Tony looked exhausted. Peter wanted to feel bad for him, wanted to feel worried, but Tony had been treating him like he was a <i>toddler</i>. Until he heard the truth, he wasn\u2019t letting up.</p><p>Tony took a while to speak, finally raising his head to look Peter in his eyes - and Peter wanted to take a step back at the raw emotion he saw there, at the red-rimmed, hopeless, tear-ridden eyes, but he stood strong.</p><p>He was getting an explanation.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m worried about you,\u201d he muttered, and Peter\u2019s eyes softened, his arms falling loosely to his side. His heart seemed to cave in on itself with every word his dad spoke. \u201cYou scared me, kiddo.\u201d He tilted his head, and Peter\u2019s heart skipped a beat when he realized Tony Stark was\u2026 <i>crying</i>?</p><p>And <i>he </i>was the cause of it.</p><p><i>Why </i>did Peter tell Tony?</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to lose you.\u201d Tony whispered that last line, and that was when Peter\u2019s heart finally shattered. He stumbled forwards to wrap his arms around his dad, though the arrangement they had was more so Tony hugging Peter.</p><p>He clutched an arm tightly around his kid\u2019s back, a hand threading through his curls, as Peter buried his face in his dad\u2019s chest. He listened to the sound of his heart beating faster than it should\u2019ve been as they held each other tightly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201d</p><p>Tony just tightened his hold.</p><p>\u201cYou almost did,\u201d Tony muttered, rubbing circles onto Peter\u2019s back, and Peter tensed at the reminder.</p><p>He <i>hated </i>that he was hurting his dad like this. How could he explain that he didn\u2019t feel like he had a choice? That it felt as though everything was crashing down on him, crushing him from the inside? That everything was going wrong and it felt like nothing would ever go right again?</p><p>That if he lived another minute he felt like he would fade to nothing\u2026</p><p>and no one would care?</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019d you want to keep me in my room?\u201d Peter mumbled into Tony\u2019s chest, eyes partially closed, feeling safe and comforted in his dad\u2019s arms. Tony took a while to respond.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know if you would try to\u2026.\u201d Tony sighed deeply before finding the word. \u201c<i>Leave</i>.\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s breath hitched in his throat. Why Tony didn\u2019t want to let him out of his sight. Why he was hesitant to leave him alone. He wasn\u2019t scared of what others would do to Peter\u2026</p><p>he was scared of what Peter would do to <i>himself</i>.</p><p>Peter found himself too shocked - too ashamed, too <i>upset</i>, to respond, so Tony continued.</p><p>\u201cYou mean so much to me, Peter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop.\u201d Peter couldn\u2019t stand to hear this speech. This guilt-inducing, tear-jerking speech.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t stand to lose you.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Stop</i>.\u201d Why wasn\u2019t Tony <i>listening</i>? Didn\u2019t he know guilt would only make it worse?</p><p>\u201cIf you died-\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Tony</i>,\u201d the strangled sob wracked its way through Peter\u2019s throat before he even registered the word, <i>begging </i>him to stop, but the man continued as if Peter hadn\u2019t even spoken.</p><p>\u201c<i>If you died</i>,\u201d he repeated louder as if to drown Peter out, \u201cyou know I would follow.\u201d</p>",

Please be careful!! &lt;3</i></b></p><hr><p>The walk back to the tower went even slower than the walk to the park. Tony had his arm slung lazily over Peter\u2019s shoulders as the two slowly admired the buildings around them - <i>the city of New York </i>- but Peter couldn\u2019t say he didn\u2019t notice Tony\u2019s arm tighten around him whenever the pair crossed the street, or got too near a body of water.</p><p>As if Tony thought he would jump in front of a car or into the lake at a moment\u2019s notice.</p><p>Peter <i>had </i>been feeling relaxed as soon as he got his thoughts off his chest, but the way Tony was acting now just made him tense once again. There was a kind of fear and protectiveness radiating off Tony, and Peter sighed internally when he realized this feeling wasn\u2019t going to go away any time soon.</p>[[MORE]]<p>As Tony\u2019s fingers clenched tighter around Peter\u2019s shoulders as they stood waiting at a crosswalk, Peter wondered if he made a mistake telling Tony. He\u2019d been doing well thus far - he\u2019d been <i>surviving </i>- he could\u2019ve continued on like that. Maybe healed <i>himself</i>. Tony would have never had to know.</p><p>Know about the <i>war </i>raging in his head.</p><p>The thoughts that never gave him a break.</p><p>Suddenly, the dark cloud returned to swallow Peter, bringing forward thoughts, <i>feelings</i>, that Peter had grown used to over the last few months - but that didn\u2019t make them any less scary.</p><p>Peter was suddenly glad Tony was holding on to him so tightly. The <i>jump-in-front-of-a-car</i> idea didn\u2019t seem so bad anymore.</p><p>They reached the compound in silence, Peter now <i>convinced </i>that telling Tony was the wrong choice. He didn\u2019t need to burden Tony with this - he was <i>fine</i>. He could deal with it. He <i>had </i>been dealing with it.</p><p>What a burden he was.</p><p>Tony pulled open the door to the tower and let Peter walk in first, who kept his head down and avoided eye contact as he crossed the threshold and immediately started to walk upstairs to his bedroom. Shut the door behind him, blast music through his headphones, and pretend that <i>nightmare </i>had never occured.</p><p>Such a horrible, horrible decision.</p><p>Why on <i>earth</i> had he decided to tell Tony?</p><p>He was positive he would never look at Peter the same way again.</p><p>\u201cPeter?\u201d Tony\u2019s voice stopped Peter on the second step and he turned back around warily. Tony nodded his head to the kitchen. \u201cCome sit with me for a second.\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s heart dropped to his shoes as Tony let the way to the kitchen table. They were going to <i>talk</i>.</p><p>What questions was Tony going to ask? More importantly, how should Peter answer so Tony knew he wasn\u2019t lying, but also dulled down enough to prevent him being thrown into a mental asylum?</p><p>The two took a seat across each other at the round table, Peter sitting rigidly with his hands in his lap, looking everywhere in the room but at the man who was staring intently at him. Peter refused to look him in the eye. He didn\u2019t know what he would see if he looked - disappointment, disgust, anger - but he knew it wouldn\u2019t be good.</p><p>\u201cPeter.\u201d Peter hummed in recognition, eyes settling on the table somewhere between them. \u201cLook at me, please.\u201d</p><p>Peter groaned inwardly as he slowly brought his eyes up to meet Tony\u2019s.</p><p>The older man was leaning forward, his arms folded lightly on the table in front of him, eyes squinting like Peter was just another piece of machinery to figure out, the lack of <i>emotion</i> shocking Peter, whose own eyes were being heated with unshed tears.</p><p><i>Why </i>did he tell Tony? There was a reason he hadn\u2019t told anyone before. There was a <i>reason </i>he kept this to himself. He didn\u2019t want to deal with <i>this</i>. The conversations, the tears, the questions of <i>why </i>and <i>how long</i>.</p><p>So he was confused when Tony didn\u2019t do any of the following, instead opting for:</p><p>\u201cYou want to play Monopoly?\u201d</p><p>Apparently the surprise was evident on Peter\u2019s face, because Tony just raised an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cIs that a \u2018no\u2019? I have other board games.\u201d</p><p>Peter took a minute to gather his thoughts.</p><p>Where was the heart-to-heart conversation? Why wasn\u2019t Tony addressing the situation?</p><p>Nevertheless, Peter nodded quickly and cleared his throat.</p><p>\u201cUm, no. No, Monopoly\u2019s great.\u201d</p><p>Five minutes later, after the game was set up on the table, the money being divided evenly and houses organized in colour-coordinated piles. For some reason Tony insisted on the two of them travelling to the other room to get the game <i>together </i>even though he <i>knew </i>Peter knows where it was, but Peter tried to shrug off the feeling as they started to play the game.</p><p>About half way through Peter pushed back the chair and started to get up from the table when Tony stopped him suddenly.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019re you going, squirt?\u201d</p><p>Peter cocked his head at the nickname.</p><p>\u201cSquirt? You haven\u2019t called me that since I was ten.\u201d</p><p>Tony, who would\u2019ve <i>loved </i>to make fun of Peter about \u2018how cute he looked\u2019 at a time like this, looked strangely serious, waiting for an answer.</p><p>\u201cJust to the bathroom,\u201d Peter answered slowly. <i>Why was he being so serious?</i></p><p>Tony nodded with a faint smile and Peter rose from the table and began walking down the hall when he heard Tony say something from behind him. He turned suddenly.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Tony shook his head innocently.</p><p>\u201cNothin.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Suddenly, F.R.I.D.A.Y.\u2019s voice echoed through the room.</p><p>\u201c<i>All windows are locked</i>.\u201d</p><p>Peter squinted his eyes at Tony, who looked like someone had just found out his secret.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you just do?\u201d Peter asked, but Tony just smiled sweetly. Peter saw right through it.</p><p>\u201cNothing, bud, now <i>go</i>.\u201d Then, sounding forced, \u201cIf you come back fast enough, I\u2019ll <i>maybe </i>not steal your money.\u201d</p><p>Peter wanted to smile at the joke, but it sounded like Tony didn\u2019t really mean it. Like he was forcing himself to make conversation light. He just shrugged and turned back around, entering the bathroom, and locking the door behind him.</p><p>When Peter reentered the kitchen, something was\u2026 different. He couldn\u2019t place it.</p><p>His money was still in place, he noticed when he sat down, and Tony was still sitting at the table, drumming his fingers absentmindedly against the pair of die, so Peter just decided to shrug it off and continue the game.</p><p>\u201cYour move,\u201d Tony said when Peter settled, tossing the die over the board. Peter tried to ignore the unsettled feeling in his stomach as he finished the game.</p><p>\u29df</p><p>Tony won the game by a longshot. He tried to dull down the business man in him for Peter\u2019s sake, but he couldn\u2019t help it, analyzing every decision before he made it. Peter didn\u2019t seem bothered though, laughing every time Tony took a wad of paper money from him.</p><p>Though, something was <i>off </i>about how serious Tony was. He wasn\u2019t laughing whenever the die fell off the table as a result of Peter not being able to control his strength, or when Peter made a <i>terribly </i>awful move and almost went bankrupt. He looked like he barely even cared about the game, his eyes on Peter practically the whole time.</p><p>Finally, after they had the board and all corresponding pieces packed up, Peter starting heading back towards the stairs. He didn\u2019t feel as upset anymore, but he <i>did </i>have a biology test coming up to study for.</p><p>But again, Tony called him back.</p><p>\u201cWhat, bored of me already?\u201d</p><p>Peter turned back around to where Tony had just stood from the table and was looking at him with a look he couldn\u2019t quite identify. Was it fear, or concern? He was trying to mask it with humour, but Peter had been living with him for enough time to see straight through it.</p><p>Though, Peter couldn\u2019t <i>quite </i>identify what was underneath, so he couldn\u2019t call Tony out on it <i>just </i>yet.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you have in mind?\u201d</p><p>Tony hesitated for a moment, and Peter realized he didn\u2019t know himself. For some reason, he just wanted to keep Peter with him. Normally, that would be fine by Peter, but after the conversation they just had, Peter knew Tony meant something behind it.</p><p>He just couldn\u2019t figure out what.</p><p>\u201cWhat about a movie?\u201d Tony suggested suddenly, pointing to the flat screen t.v. through the wide, open-concept doorway.</p><p>\u201cMr. Stark, it\u2019s three o\u2019clock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrooklyn Nine-Nine marathon, then? You like that show, right?\u201d</p><p>Peter stared at him for a moment more before caving in and shrugging.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I guess.\u201d</p><p>Tony\u2019s face broke out in a tight-lipped but not reserved smile as he walked around the table, laid an arm across Peter\u2019s shoulders, and led him into the living room and onto a couch, the arm not moving as he reached over to grab the remote from the nearby coffee table and handing it to Peter.</p><p>The unsettled feeling sinking deeper into Peter\u2019s bones, he flipped through the dozens of extra options on Tony\u2019s large t.v. before settling on the one that played the desired show, and sat back as the characters started talking about Dianne Wiest.</p><p>\u29df</p><p>Two hours and six episodes later, Peter was getting antsy. Tony hadn\u2019t moved his arm from Peter\u2019s shoulders for the last 120 minutes, and he kept looking at Peter as if worried he would disappear from right under Tony\u2019s nose.</p><p>As soon as their sixth episode came to a close, Peter started to adjust himself on the couch. He sensed an argument begin to rise from Tony, so he spoke first.</p><p>\u201cI have a biology test to study for,\u201d he tried to explain, but Tony laid a hand on his arm (albeit a gentle one), holding him back.</p><p>\u201cI can help you study,\u201d he offered, but Peter just shook his head and shrugged it off. Honestly, it was getting kind of creepy how Tony wouldn\u2019t let Peter go. It was as if he was worried about what would happen if Peter left his eyesight.</p><p>And Peter finally thought he knew why.</p><p>\u201cIs there a villain after you or something?\u201d Peter asked suddenly turning so he was facing Tony. The man\u2019s face fell into one of confusion and slight disbelief, and he looked taken aback by the statement. He shook his head quickly.</p><p>\u201cNo, why? Are you worried about something?\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s eyes squinted accusingly.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t let me out of your sight, like something\u2019s lurking around the corner, and you\u2019re scared it\u2019ll get me if you let me go.\u201d</p><p>Tony\u2019s expression fell into one of relief and he sat back on the couch.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing like that, Pete,\u201d he said, his voice more relaxed and light - though there was still an undertone Peter couldn\u2019t quite identify.</p><p>\u201cThen why won\u2019t you let me go anywhere unless you\u2019re with me?\u201d Peter was being relentless. Tony had never struck him as a \u201chelicopter parent\u201d. Sure, he liked to keep a close eye on Peter,but that was just being a concerned parent. <i>This </i>was something different.</p><p>\u201cI just want to spend time with you, Petey,\u201d he chuckled, reaching a hand out to ruffle his curls, and Peter found himself leaning into the touch. \u201cI feel like I haven\u2019t spent time with you in awhile.\u201d</p><p>Peter nodded suddenly. Yeah, that made sense.</p><p>\u201cBut don\u2019t you have important <i>Stark Industries </i>stuff to do?\u201d He said the company name like it was something large and intimidating to be feared, and Tony laughed at the sentiment behind it.</p><p>\u201cIt can wait for a night. I\u2019m spending time with my kid. Everything else can wait.\u201d</p><p>For the first time that day, it didn\u2019t feel like Tony was hiding anything when he spoke to Peter. That line sounded genuinely, one hundred percent honest, and Peter finally felt himself thaw at the words. He smiled, finally allowing it to comfortably reach his eyes, and he collapsed back on the couch, leaning into Tony\u2019s side.</p><p>Tony pressed \u201cPlay\u201d on the remote, allowing the next episode to play, which Peter was too focused on to see the way Tony closed his eyes in relief, before looking down at his kid, sadness haunting his features.</p><p>\u29df</p><p>This was the longest t.v. marathon the two had ever had, finally ending somewhere around nine. Tony had gotten up from the couch half way through to make the pair a fruit and vegetable platter, and Peter was too engrossed in the show to notice that the man\u2019s worried eyes never left him once.</p><p>Finally, the credits for their last episode played, and Tony finally reached over and shut off the t.v. Peter sat up groggily and ran a tired hand over his eyes, checking the time on his phone and almost jumping in surprise.</p><p>\u201cThat was <i>six hours</i>?\u201d he exclaimed, and Tony chuckled at his response.</p><p>\u201cTime flies when you\u2019re spending time with the awesomest person in the world.\u201d</p><p>Peter frowned disapprovingly. \u201cMr. Stark, that\u2019s not a real word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is if I say it is. I\u2019m also the smartiest.\u201d</p><p>The improper grammar seemed to grate against Peter\u2019s ears.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re doing that on purpose!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre too!\u201d</p><p>Tony wanted to continue \u201carguing\u201d with his kid, but instead he found his face splitting into a smile he just couldn\u2019t contain. Within seconds the two were collapsed against each other, laughing in such a way they were crying and gasping for breath.</p><p>Peter had no idea why that was so funny. It was just a childish reaction. Maybe it was because they were watching t.v. for six hours straight - they had become untethered from reality.</p><p>Finally, the laughter finally subsided, and Peter found himself curled up against Tony\u2019s side, the older man running his fingers through his curls absentmindedly, when Peter finally yawned.</p><p>\u201cTired?\u201d</p><p>Peter nodded into Tony\u2019s hand, and Tony smiled at the feeling of his kid against his chest, living. <i>Breathing</i>.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you head off to bed, then?\u201d he spoke softly, glad the kid was finally tired. It meant he could sleep, and nothing could hurt him when he was asleep.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t hurt <i>himself </i>when he was asleep.</p><p>Peter groggily stood from the couch, letting out a breath at the action of untangling himself from the position he had been sitting in for so long. He waved loosely in Tony\u2019s general direction, hearing a laugh from the man that made him smile before climbing up the stairs.</p><p>He thought he heard a few words being spoken from behind him when he was halfway up the stairs, but they were too quiet to be directed at him, so he ignored them, instead choosing to stumble into his room and collapse on his bed.</p><p>He was out like a light.</p><p>\u29df</p><p>Peter woke earlier than normal the next morning. A look at his clock said it was six-thirty, making his eyebrows raise in surprise.</p><p><i>That\u2019s what going to bed early will get you</i>, he thought to himself as he sat up and yawned, stretching his arms over his head. He wasn\u2019t even tired.</p><p><i>Over nine hours of sleep</i>, he thought approvingly. <i>I haven\u2019t slept that well since</i>-</p><p>Peter froze suddenly, legs dangling off his bed. Since before he had been thrown into this hole of darkness and despair and bad thoughts.</p><p><i>Nope</i>, he thought suddenly, pushing himself up to stand. <i>Not doing that today. I feel good. I\u2019m not going to start thinking about that</i>.</p><p>He got dressed, throwing on a simple pair of jeans and the first sweatshirt he found as well as the watch Tony had bought him on his twelfth birthday (was it heavier than usual?), before heading to his door - but stopping short.</p><p>It was closed.</p><p>It was <i>never </i>closed.</p><p>Peter didn\u2019t like when his door was closed. He found it suffocating. Even though his room in the tower was quite large, the door made it feel abnormally small, closing him in, burying him in darkness.</p><p>He reached for the doorknob to pull it open, but F.R.I.D.A.Y.\u2019s voice almost made him jump out of his skin.</p><p>\u201c<i>Mr. Stark wouldn\u2019t like you to leave your room until seven a.m.</i>\u201d</p><p>Peter froze.</p><p><i>What?</i></p><p>He had a curfew. No Spiderman-ing past ten. There was never a set time for him to <i>sleep in </i>in the morning.</p><p>\u201cWhen did he say this?\u201d he called out quietly to the empty room. (He had grown used to speaking comfortably to the open air since moving in.)</p><p>\u201c<i>Last night.</i>\u201d</p><p>Oh. <i>That\u2019s </i>what he had been saying to himself.</p><p>\u201c<i>Mr. Stark has asked me to alert him if you left your room beforehand</i>.\u201d</p><p>A look at Peter\u2019s alarm clock told him it was six forty-five. He sighed as he moved to sit on his bed. He could wait until seven. He didn\u2019t want to alarm Tony.</p><p>\u201cDo you know why, Fri?\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>I\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t, Peter.</i>\u201d</p><p>Peter squinted his eyes as he sat staring at the wall. Why did Tony care what he did in the morning?</p><p>\u201cIs Mr. Stark awake yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Not yet, Peter.</i>\u201d</p><p>Peter thought for a moment.</p><p>\u201cDo you have to tell Mr. Stark?\u201d</p><p>F.R.I.D.A.Y. was quiet for a minute.</p><p>\u201c<i>Why do you want to leave your room?</i>\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just want to get ready for school. Eat breakfast, and stuff. Y\u2019know?\u201d What else would he be doing? What was Tony <i>afraid </i>of?</p><p>F.R.I.D.A.Y. hesitated again, before, \u201c<i>Okay Peter, you may go. I won\u2019t alert Mr. Stark.</i>\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Fri,\u201d Peter responded, opening his door and heading down the stairs, his mind racing.</p><p>Why didn\u2019t Mr. Stark want him leaving his room?</p><p>He shook off the weird feeling that seemed to follow him (he found himself doing that a lot lately) as he headed into the kitchen. Peter grabbed the loaf of bread from the fridge, took out four slices, and placed them in the toaster oven. He might as well make Mr. Stark breakfast, too, since he was up so early, even if he <i>was </i>being an annoying helicopter parent.</p><p>Peter grabbed two plates and set them down on the table while waiting for the toast to, well, <i>toast</i>, before taking the butter from the fridge and setting it down beside the plates. Then, he moved to the drawer beside the stove to get a knife.</p><p>Because that\u2019s where the knives <i>used </i>to be.</p><p>But they weren\u2019t there now.</p><p>Peter stared in confusion at the empty drawer. Had they gotten robbed by a knife-collector?</p><p>He checked the other drawers where the other utensils were kept. Forks were still there; spoons, too.</p><p>But not knives.</p><p>\u201cF.R.I.D.A.Y.?\u201d Peter called out for the second time that morning.</p><p>\u201c<i>Yes, Peter?</i>\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are the knives?\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>In a box above the fridge</i>.\u201d</p><p>Peter froze suddenly. <i>In a box above the fridge? </i>What the heck?</p><p>He stood up on his tiptoes to peek on top of the fridge. Sure enough, there was a wicker basket there Peter was <i>positive </i>hadn\u2019t existed before. He sighed to himself as he pushed himself up onto the countertop to be able to reach the box on top. He was almost there when he heard an exclamation from behind him.</p><p>\u201cPeter, what the fuck? Get down from there!\u201d</p><p>Peter almost toppled but caught himself at the last second, stabilizing himself against the top of the fridge before looking sharply down at Tony.</p><p>\u201cWhy are the knives up here?\u201d</p><p>Tony\u2019s face flushed bright red. Peter continued to reach for the box and Tony\u2019s eyes widened as if that was the Worst Possible Thing that he could\u2019ve done.</p><p>\u201c<i>Don\u2019t touch them.</i>\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s hand froze inches from the nearest handle, the pure <i>fear </i>in Tony\u2019s voice striking him off guard. He looked down at Tony, shocked, to see him with an arm reached out to Peter, eyes pleading.</p><p>\u201cJust - come down from there, <i>please</i>.\u201d</p><p>Peter quickly climbed down from the countertop. He wasn\u2019t sure <i>what </i>was bothering Tony, but it was seriously affecting him, and Peter knew better than to challenge Tony when he had that look in his eyes - when the cool, suave billionaire was <i>pleading</i>.</p><p>He jumped down from the counter, holding his hands up, palms out, when he finally touched ground.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said quietly. He wasn\u2019t sure what had upset Tony, but the man was looking so serious, Peter unquestionably wanted to put an immediate end to\u2026 <i>whatever </i>it was.</p><p>Tony leaned against the counter, looking exhausted, watching Peter warily. Finally, he spoke.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing up so early?\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s eyes suddenly grew hard at the reminder of his early interaction with F.R.I.D.A.Y.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you want to keep me in my room?\u201d</p><p>Tony brought a hand to the bridge of his nose as he sighed deeply, closing his eyes.</p><p>\u201cShe wasn\u2019t supposed to let you out,\u201d he muttered, almost to himself - but Peter heard it clearly.</p><p>\u201c<i>Why?</i>\u201d he challenged, his voice hard. \u201cWhy are you monitoring me so closely?\u201d He crossed his arms over his chest, suddenly feeling\u2026 <i>angry</i>. Very angry at how <i>controlling </i>Tony was being. Peter was <i>fifteen</i>. He knew he wasn\u2019t an adult yet. He understood he still had a long way to go, still needed to be monitored. But he <i>should </i>be allowed to go to another room unsupervised. Go to the bathroom without needing the windows to be locked beforehand. (What <i>was </i>that, anyway?) He should be trusted to wake up as early as he wanted, and <i>use knives</i>. He wasn\u2019t an adult yet, sure, but he wasn\u2019t a <i>child</i>.</p><p>Tony looked exhausted. Peter wanted to feel bad for him, wanted to feel worried, but Tony had been treating him like he was a <i>toddler</i>. Until he heard the truth, he wasn\u2019t letting up.</p><p>Tony took a while to speak, finally raising his head to look Peter in his eyes - and Peter wanted to take a step back at the raw emotion he saw there, at the red-rimmed, hopeless, tear-ridden eyes, but he stood strong.</p><p>He was getting an explanation.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m worried about you,\u201d he muttered, and Peter\u2019s eyes softened, his arms falling loosely to his side. His heart seemed to cave in on itself with every word his dad spoke. \u201cYou scared me, kiddo.\u201d He tilted his head, and Peter\u2019s heart skipped a beat when he realized Tony Stark was\u2026 <i>crying</i>?</p><p>And <i>he </i>was the cause of it.</p><p><i>Why </i>did Peter tell Tony?</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to lose you.\u201d Tony whispered that last line, and that was when Peter\u2019s heart finally shattered. He stumbled forwards to wrap his arms around his dad, though the arrangement they had was more so Tony hugging Peter.</p><p>He clutched an arm tightly around his kid\u2019s back, a hand threading through his curls, as Peter buried his face in his dad\u2019s chest. He listened to the sound of his heart beating faster than it should\u2019ve been as they held each other tightly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201d</p><p>Tony just tightened his hold.</p><p>\u201cYou almost did,\u201d Tony muttered, rubbing circles onto Peter\u2019s back, and Peter tensed at the reminder.</p><p>He <i>hated </i>that he was hurting his dad like this. How could he explain that he didn\u2019t feel like he had a choice? That it felt as though everything was crashing down on him, crushing him from the inside? That everything was going wrong and it felt like nothing would ever go right again?</p><p>That if he lived another minute he felt like he would fade to nothing\u2026</p><p>and no one would care?</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019d you want to keep me in my room?\u201d Peter mumbled into Tony\u2019s chest, eyes partially closed, feeling safe and comforted in his dad\u2019s arms. Tony took a while to respond.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know if you would try to\u2026.\u201d Tony sighed deeply before finding the word. \u201c<i>Leave</i>.\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s breath hitched in his throat. Why Tony didn\u2019t want to let him out of his sight. Why he was hesitant to leave him alone. He wasn\u2019t scared of what others would do to Peter\u2026</p><p>he was scared of what Peter would do to <i>himself</i>.</p><p>Peter found himself too shocked - too ashamed, too <i>upset</i>, to respond, so Tony continued.</p><p>\u201cYou mean so much to me, Peter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop.\u201d Peter couldn\u2019t stand to hear this speech. This guilt-inducing, tear-jerking speech.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t stand to lose you.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Stop</i>.\u201d Why wasn\u2019t Tony <i>listening</i>? Didn\u2019t he know guilt would only make it worse?</p><p>\u201cIf you died-\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Tony</i>,\u201d the strangled sob wracked its way through Peter\u2019s throat before he even registered the word, <i>begging </i>him to stop, but the man continued as if Peter hadn\u2019t even spoken.</p><p>\u201c<i>If you died</i>,\u201d he repeated louder as if to drown Peter out, \u201cyou know I would follow.\u201d</p>",

Please be careful!! &lt;3</i></b></p><hr /><p>The walk back to the tower went even slower than the walk to the park. Tony had his arm slung lazily over Peter&rsquo;s shoulders as the two slowly admired the buildings around them - <i>the city of New York </i>- but Peter couldn&rsquo;t say he didn&rsquo;t notice Tony&rsquo;s arm tighten around him whenever the pair crossed the street, or got too near a body of water.</p><p>As if Tony thought he would jump in front of a car or into the lake at a moment&rsquo;s notice.</p><p>Peter <i>had </i>been feeling relaxed as soon as he got his thoughts off his chest, but the way Tony was acting now just made him tense once again. There was a kind of fear and protectiveness radiating off Tony, and Peter sighed internally when he realized this feeling wasn&rsquo;t going to go away any time soon.</p><p>As Tony&rsquo;s fingers clenched tighter around Peter&rsquo;s shoulders as they stood waiting at a crosswalk, Peter wondered if he made a mistake telling Tony. He&rsquo;d been doing well thus far - he&rsquo;d been <i>surviving </i>- he could&rsquo;ve continued on like that. Maybe healed <i>himself</i>. Tony would have never had to know.</p><p>Know about the <i>war </i>raging in his head.</p><p>The thoughts that never gave him a break.</p><p>Suddenly, the dark cloud returned to swallow Peter, bringing forward thoughts, <i>feelings</i>, that Peter had grown used to over the last few months - but that didn&rsquo;t make them any less scary.</p><p>Peter was suddenly glad Tony was holding on to him so tightly. The <i>jump-in-front-of-a-car</i> idea didn&rsquo;t seem so bad anymore.</p><p>They reached the compound in silence, Peter now <i>convinced </i>that telling Tony was the wrong choice. He didn&rsquo;t need to burden Tony with this - he was <i>fine</i>. He could deal with it. He <i>had </i>been dealing with it.</p><p>What a burden he was.</p><p>Tony pulled open the door to the tower and let Peter walk in first, who kept his head down and avoided eye contact as he crossed the threshold and immediately started to walk upstairs to his bedroom. Shut the door behind him, blast music through his headphones, and pretend that <i>nightmare </i>had never occured.</p><p>Such a horrible, horrible decision.</p><p>Why on <i>earth</i> had he decided to tell Tony?</p><p>He was positive he would never look at Peter the same way again.</p><p>&ldquo;Peter?&rdquo; Tony&rsquo;s voice stopped Peter on the second step and he turned back around warily. Tony nodded his head to the kitchen. &ldquo;Come sit with me for a second.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter&rsquo;s heart dropped to his shoes as Tony let the way to the kitchen table. They were going to <i>talk</i>.</p><p>What questions was Tony going to ask? More importantly, how should Peter answer so Tony knew he wasn&rsquo;t lying, but also dulled down enough to prevent him being thrown into a mental asylum?</p><p>The two took a seat across each other at the round table, Peter sitting rigidly with his hands in his lap, looking everywhere in the room but at the man who was staring intently at him. Peter refused to look him in the eye. He didn&rsquo;t know what he would see if he looked - disappointment, disgust, anger - but he knew it wouldn&rsquo;t be good.</p><p>&ldquo;Peter.&rdquo; Peter hummed in recognition, eyes settling on the table somewhere between them. &ldquo;Look at me, please.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter groaned inwardly as he slowly brought his eyes up to meet Tony&rsquo;s.</p><p>The older man was leaning forward, his arms folded lightly on the table in front of him, eyes squinting like Peter was just another piece of machinery to figure out, the lack of <i>emotion</i> shocking Peter, whose own eyes were being heated with unshed tears.</p><p><i>Why </i>did he tell Tony? There was a reason he hadn&rsquo;t told anyone before. There was a <i>reason </i>he kept this to himself. He didn&rsquo;t want to deal with <i>this</i>. The conversations, the tears, the questions of <i>why </i>and <i>how long</i>.</p><p>So he was confused when Tony didn&rsquo;t do any of the following, instead opting for:</p><p>&ldquo;You want to play Monopoly?&rdquo;</p><p>Apparently the surprise was evident on Peter&rsquo;s face, because Tony just raised an eyebrow.</p><p>&ldquo;Is that a &lsquo;no&rsquo;? I have other board games.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter took a minute to gather his thoughts.</p><p>Where was the heart-to-heart conversation? Why wasn&rsquo;t Tony addressing the situation?</p><p>Nevertheless, Peter nodded quickly and cleared his throat.</p><p>&ldquo;Um, no. No, Monopoly&rsquo;s great.&rdquo;</p><p>Five minutes later, after the game was set up on the table, the money being divided evenly and houses organized in colour-coordinated piles. For some reason Tony insisted on the two of them travelling to the other room to get the game <i>together </i>even though he <i>knew </i>Peter knows where it was, but Peter tried to shrug off the feeling as they started to play the game.</p><p>About half way through Peter pushed back the chair and started to get up from the table when Tony stopped him suddenly.</p><p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;re you going, squirt?&rdquo;</p><p>Peter cocked his head at the nickname.</p><p>&ldquo;Squirt? You haven&rsquo;t called me that since I was ten.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony, who would&rsquo;ve <i>loved </i>to make fun of Peter about &lsquo;how cute he looked&rsquo; at a time like this, looked strangely serious, waiting for an answer.</p><p>&ldquo;Just to the bathroom,&rdquo; Peter answered slowly. <i>Why was he being so serious?</i></p><p>Tony nodded with a faint smile and Peter rose from the table and began walking down the hall when he heard Tony say something from behind him. He turned suddenly.</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p><p>Tony shook his head innocently.</p><p>&ldquo;Nothin.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>Suddenly, F.R.I.D.A.Y.&rsquo;s voice echoed through the room.</p><p>&ldquo;<i>All windows are locked</i>.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter squinted his eyes at Tony, who looked like someone had just found out his secret.</p><p>&ldquo;What did you just do?&rdquo; Peter asked, but Tony just smiled sweetly. Peter saw right through it.</p><p>&ldquo;Nothing, bud, now <i>go</i>.&rdquo; Then, sounding forced, &ldquo;If you come back fast enough, I&rsquo;ll <i>maybe </i>not steal your money.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter wanted to smile at the joke, but it sounded like Tony didn&rsquo;t really mean it. Like he was forcing himself to make conversation light. He just shrugged and turned back around, entering the bathroom, and locking the door behind him.</p><p>When Peter reentered the kitchen, something was&hellip; different. He couldn&rsquo;t place it.</p><p>His money was still in place, he noticed when he sat down, and Tony was still sitting at the table, drumming his fingers absentmindedly against the pair of die, so Peter just decided to shrug it off and continue the game.</p><p>&ldquo;Your move,&rdquo; Tony said when Peter settled, tossing the die over the board. Peter tried to ignore the unsettled feeling in his stomach as he finished the game.</p><p>&#10719;</p><p>Tony won the game by a longshot. He tried to dull down the business man in him for Peter&rsquo;s sake, but he couldn&rsquo;t help it, analyzing every decision before he made it. Peter didn&rsquo;t seem bothered though, laughing every time Tony took a wad of paper money from him.</p><p>Though, something was <i>off </i>about how serious Tony was. He wasn&rsquo;t laughing whenever the die fell off the table as a result of Peter not being able to control his strength, or when Peter made a <i>terribly </i>awful move and almost went bankrupt. He looked like he barely even cared about the game, his eyes on Peter practically the whole time.</p><p>Finally, after they had the board and all corresponding pieces packed up, Peter starting heading back towards the stairs. He didn&rsquo;t feel as upset anymore, but he <i>did </i>have a biology test coming up to study for.</p><p>But again, Tony called him back.</p><p>&ldquo;What, bored of me already?&rdquo;</p><p>Peter turned back around to where Tony had just stood from the table and was looking at him with a look he couldn&rsquo;t quite identify. Was it fear, or concern? He was trying to mask it with humour, but Peter had been living with him for enough time to see straight through it.</p><p>Though, Peter couldn&rsquo;t <i>quite </i>identify what was underneath, so he couldn&rsquo;t call Tony out on it <i>just </i>yet.</p><p>&ldquo;What did you have in mind?&rdquo;</p><p>Tony hesitated for a moment, and Peter realized he didn&rsquo;t know himself. For some reason, he just wanted to keep Peter with him. Normally, that would be fine by Peter, but after the conversation they just had, Peter knew Tony meant something behind it.</p><p>He just couldn&rsquo;t figure out what.</p><p>&ldquo;What about a movie?&rdquo; Tony suggested suddenly, pointing to the flat screen t.v. through the wide, open-concept doorway.</p><p>&ldquo;Mr. Stark, it&rsquo;s three o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Brooklyn Nine-Nine marathon, then? You like that show, right?&rdquo;</p><p>Peter stared at him for a moment more before caving in and shrugging.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, I guess.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony&rsquo;s face broke out in a tight-lipped but not reserved smile as he walked around the table, laid an arm across Peter&rsquo;s shoulders, and led him into the living room and onto a couch, the arm not moving as he reached over to grab the remote from the nearby coffee table and handing it to Peter.</p><p>The unsettled feeling sinking deeper into Peter&rsquo;s bones, he flipped through the dozens of extra options on Tony&rsquo;s large t.v. before settling on the one that played the desired show, and sat back as the characters started talking about Dianne Wiest.</p><p>&#10719;</p><p>Two hours and six episodes later, Peter was getting antsy. Tony hadn&rsquo;t moved his arm from Peter&rsquo;s shoulders for the last 120 minutes, and he kept looking at Peter as if worried he would disappear from right under Tony&rsquo;s nose.</p><p>As soon as their sixth episode came to a close, Peter started to adjust himself on the couch. He sensed an argument begin to rise from Tony, so he spoke first.</p><p>&ldquo;I have a biology test to study for,&rdquo; he tried to explain, but Tony laid a hand on his arm (albeit a gentle one), holding him back.</p><p>&ldquo;I can help you study,&rdquo; he offered, but Peter just shook his head and shrugged it off. Honestly, it was getting kind of creepy how Tony wouldn&rsquo;t let Peter go. It was as if he was worried about what would happen if Peter left his eyesight.</p><p>And Peter finally thought he knew why.</p><p>&ldquo;Is there a villain after you or something?&rdquo; Peter asked suddenly turning so he was facing Tony. The man&rsquo;s face fell into one of confusion and slight disbelief, and he looked taken aback by the statement. He shook his head quickly.</p><p>&ldquo;No, why? Are you worried about something?&rdquo;</p><p>Peter&rsquo;s eyes squinted accusingly.</p><p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t let me out of your sight, like something&rsquo;s lurking around the corner, and you&rsquo;re scared it&rsquo;ll get me if you let me go.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony&rsquo;s expression fell into one of relief and he sat back on the couch.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing like that, Pete,&rdquo; he said, his voice more relaxed and light - though there was still an undertone Peter couldn&rsquo;t quite identify.</p><p>&ldquo;Then why won&rsquo;t you let me go anywhere unless you&rsquo;re with me?&rdquo; Peter was being relentless. Tony had never struck him as a &ldquo;helicopter parent&rdquo;. Sure, he liked to keep a close eye on Peter,but that was just being a concerned parent. <i>This </i>was something different.</p><p>&ldquo;I just want to spend time with you, Petey,&rdquo; he chuckled, reaching a hand out to ruffle his curls, and Peter found himself leaning into the touch. &ldquo;I feel like I haven&rsquo;t spent time with you in awhile.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter nodded suddenly. Yeah, that made sense.</p><p>&ldquo;But don&rsquo;t you have important <i>Stark Industries </i>stuff to do?&rdquo; He said the company name like it was something large and intimidating to be feared, and Tony laughed at the sentiment behind it.</p><p>&ldquo;It can wait for a night. I&rsquo;m spending time with my kid. Everything else can wait.&rdquo;</p><p>For the first time that day, it didn&rsquo;t feel like Tony was hiding anything when he spoke to Peter. That line sounded genuinely, one hundred percent honest, and Peter finally felt himself thaw at the words. He smiled, finally allowing it to comfortably reach his eyes, and he collapsed back on the couch, leaning into Tony&rsquo;s side.</p><p>Tony pressed &ldquo;Play&rdquo; on the remote, allowing the next episode to play, which Peter was too focused on to see the way Tony closed his eyes in relief, before looking down at his kid, sadness haunting his features.</p><p>&#10719;</p><p>This was the longest t.v. marathon the two had ever had, finally ending somewhere around nine. Tony had gotten up from the couch half way through to make the pair a fruit and vegetable platter, and Peter was too engrossed in the show to notice that the man&rsquo;s worried eyes never left him once.</p><p>Finally, the credits for their last episode played, and Tony finally reached over and shut off the t.v. Peter sat up groggily and ran a tired hand over his eyes, checking the time on his phone and almost jumping in surprise.</p><p>&ldquo;That was <i>six hours</i>?&rdquo; he exclaimed, and Tony chuckled at his response.</p><p>&ldquo;Time flies when you&rsquo;re spending time with the awesomest person in the world.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter frowned disapprovingly. &ldquo;Mr. Stark, that&rsquo;s not a real word.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It is if I say it is. I&rsquo;m also the smartiest.&rdquo;</p><p>The improper grammar seemed to grate against Peter&rsquo;s ears.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re doing that on purpose!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Am not.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Are too!&rdquo;</p><p>Tony wanted to continue &ldquo;arguing&rdquo; with his kid, but instead he found his face splitting into a smile he just couldn&rsquo;t contain. Within seconds the two were collapsed against each other, laughing in such a way they were crying and gasping for breath.</p><p>Peter had no idea why that was so funny. It was just a childish reaction. Maybe it was because they were watching t.v. for six hours straight - they had become untethered from reality.</p><p>Finally, the laughter finally subsided, and Peter found himself curled up against Tony&rsquo;s side, the older man running his fingers through his curls absentmindedly, when Peter finally yawned.</p><p>&ldquo;Tired?&rdquo;</p><p>Peter nodded into Tony&rsquo;s hand, and Tony smiled at the feeling of his kid against his chest, living. <i>Breathing</i>.</p><p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you head off to bed, then?&rdquo; he spoke softly, glad the kid was finally tired. It meant he could sleep, and nothing could hurt him when he was asleep.</p><p>He couldn&rsquo;t hurt <i>himself </i>when he was asleep.</p><p>Peter groggily stood from the couch, letting out a breath at the action of untangling himself from the position he had been sitting in for so long. He waved loosely in Tony&rsquo;s general direction, hearing a laugh from the man that made him smile before climbing up the stairs.</p><p>He thought he heard a few words being spoken from behind him when he was halfway up the stairs, but they were too quiet to be directed at him, so he ignored them, instead choosing to stumble into his room and collapse on his bed.</p><p>He was out like a light.</p><p>&#10719;</p><p>Peter woke earlier than normal the next morning. A look at his clock said it was six-thirty, making his eyebrows raise in surprise.</p><p><i>That&rsquo;s what going to bed early will get you</i>, he thought to himself as he sat up and yawned, stretching his arms over his head. He wasn&rsquo;t even tired.</p><p><i>Over nine hours of sleep</i>, he thought approvingly. <i>I haven&rsquo;t slept that well since</i>-</p><p>Peter froze suddenly, legs dangling off his bed. Since before he had been thrown into this hole of darkness and despair and bad thoughts.</p><p><i>Nope</i>, he thought suddenly, pushing himself up to stand. <i>Not doing that today. I feel good. I&rsquo;m not going to start thinking about that</i>.</p><p>He got dressed, throwing on a simple pair of jeans and the first sweatshirt he found as well as the watch Tony had bought him on his twelfth birthday (was it heavier than usual?), before heading to his door - but stopping short.</p><p>It was closed.</p><p>It was <i>never </i>closed.</p><p>Peter didn&rsquo;t like when his door was closed. He found it suffocating. Even though his room in the tower was quite large, the door made it feel abnormally small, closing him in, burying him in darkness.</p><p>He reached for the doorknob to pull it open, but F.R.I.D.A.Y.&rsquo;s voice almost made him jump out of his skin.</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Mr. Stark wouldn&rsquo;t like you to leave your room until seven a.m.</i>&rdquo;</p><p>Peter froze.</p><p><i>What?</i></p><p>He had a curfew. No Spiderman-ing past ten. There was never a set time for him to <i>sleep in </i>in the morning.</p><p>&ldquo;When did he say this?&rdquo; he called out quietly to the empty room. (He had grown used to speaking comfortably to the open air since moving in.)</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Last night.</i>&rdquo;</p><p>Oh. <i>That&rsquo;s </i>what he had been saying to himself.</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Mr. Stark has asked me to alert him if you left your room beforehand</i>.&rdquo;</p><p>A look at Peter&rsquo;s alarm clock told him it was six forty-five. He sighed as he moved to sit on his bed. He could wait until seven. He didn&rsquo;t want to alarm Tony.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you know why, Fri?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;<i>I&rsquo;m afraid I don&rsquo;t, Peter.</i>&rdquo;</p><p>Peter squinted his eyes as he sat staring at the wall. Why did Tony care what he did in the morning?</p><p>&ldquo;Is Mr. Stark awake yet?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Not yet, Peter.</i>&rdquo;</p><p>Peter thought for a moment.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you have to tell Mr. Stark?&rdquo;</p><p>F.R.I.D.A.Y. was quiet for a minute.</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Why do you want to leave your room?</i>&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I just want to get ready for school. Eat breakfast, and stuff. Y&rsquo;know?&rdquo; What else would he be doing? What was Tony <i>afraid </i>of?</p><p>F.R.I.D.A.Y. hesitated again, before, &ldquo;<i>Okay Peter, you may go. I won&rsquo;t alert Mr. Stark.</i>&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks, Fri,&rdquo; Peter responded, opening his door and heading down the stairs, his mind racing.</p><p>Why didn&rsquo;t Mr. Stark want him leaving his room?</p><p>He shook off the weird feeling that seemed to follow him (he found himself doing that a lot lately) as he headed into the kitchen. Peter grabbed the loaf of bread from the fridge, took out four slices, and placed them in the toaster oven. He might as well make Mr. Stark breakfast, too, since he was up so early, even if he <i>was </i>being an annoying helicopter parent.</p><p>Peter grabbed two plates and set them down on the table while waiting for the toast to, well, <i>toast</i>, before taking the butter from the fridge and setting it down beside the plates. Then, he moved to the drawer beside the stove to get a knife.</p><p>Because that&rsquo;s where the knives <i>used </i>to be.</p><p>But they weren&rsquo;t there now.</p><p>Peter stared in confusion at the empty drawer. Had they gotten robbed by a knife-collector?</p><p>He checked the other drawers where the other utensils were kept. Forks were still there; spoons, too.</p><p>But not knives.</p><p>&ldquo;F.R.I.D.A.Y.?&rdquo; Peter called out for the second time that morning.</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Yes, Peter?</i>&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Where are the knives?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;<i>In a box above the fridge</i>.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter froze suddenly. <i>In a box above the fridge? </i>What the heck?</p><p>He stood up on his tiptoes to peek on top of the fridge. Sure enough, there was a wicker basket there Peter was <i>positive </i>hadn&rsquo;t existed before. He sighed to himself as he pushed himself up onto the countertop to be able to reach the box on top. He was almost there when he heard an exclamation from behind him.</p><p>&ldquo;Peter, what the fuck? Get down from there!&rdquo;</p><p>Peter almost toppled but caught himself at the last second, stabilizing himself against the top of the fridge before looking sharply down at Tony.</p><p>&ldquo;Why are the knives up here?&rdquo;</p><p>Tony&rsquo;s face flushed bright red. Peter continued to reach for the box and Tony&rsquo;s eyes widened as if that was the Worst Possible Thing that he could&rsquo;ve done.</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Don&rsquo;t touch them.</i>&rdquo;</p><p>Peter&rsquo;s hand froze inches from the nearest handle, the pure <i>fear </i>in Tony&rsquo;s voice striking him off guard. He looked down at Tony, shocked, to see him with an arm reached out to Peter, eyes pleading.</p><p>&ldquo;Just - come down from there, <i>please</i>.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter quickly climbed down from the countertop. He wasn&rsquo;t sure <i>what </i>was bothering Tony, but it was seriously affecting him, and Peter knew better than to challenge Tony when he had that look in his eyes - when the cool, suave billionaire was <i>pleading</i>.</p><p>He jumped down from the counter, holding his hands up, palms out, when he finally touched ground.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; he said quietly. He wasn&rsquo;t sure what had upset Tony, but the man was looking so serious, Peter unquestionably wanted to put an immediate end to&hellip; <i>whatever </i>it was.</p><p>Tony leaned against the counter, looking exhausted, watching Peter warily. Finally, he spoke.</p><p>&ldquo;What are you doing up so early?&rdquo;</p><p>Peter&rsquo;s eyes suddenly grew hard at the reminder of his early interaction with F.R.I.D.A.Y.</p><p>&ldquo;Why did you want to keep me in my room?&rdquo;</p><p>Tony brought a hand to the bridge of his nose as he sighed deeply, closing his eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;She wasn&rsquo;t supposed to let you out,&rdquo; he muttered, almost to himself - but Peter heard it clearly.</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Why?</i>&rdquo; he challenged, his voice hard. &ldquo;Why are you monitoring me so closely?&rdquo; He crossed his arms over his chest, suddenly feeling&hellip; <i>angry</i>. Very angry at how <i>controlling </i>Tony was being. Peter was <i>fifteen</i>. He knew he wasn&rsquo;t an adult yet. He understood he still had a long way to go, still needed to be monitored. But he <i>should </i>be allowed to go to another room unsupervised. Go to the bathroom without needing the windows to be locked beforehand. (What <i>was </i>that, anyway?) He should be trusted to wake up as early as he wanted, and <i>use knives</i>. He wasn&rsquo;t an adult yet, sure, but he wasn&rsquo;t a <i>child</i>.</p><p>Tony looked exhausted. Peter wanted to feel bad for him, wanted to feel worried, but Tony had been treating him like he was a <i>toddler</i>. Until he heard the truth, he wasn&rsquo;t letting up.</p><p>Tony took a while to speak, finally raising his head to look Peter in his eyes - and Peter wanted to take a step back at the raw emotion he saw there, at the red-rimmed, hopeless, tear-ridden eyes, but he stood strong.</p><p>He was getting an explanation.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m worried about you,&rdquo; he muttered, and Peter&rsquo;s eyes softened, his arms falling loosely to his side. His heart seemed to cave in on itself with every word his dad spoke. &ldquo;You scared me, kiddo.&rdquo; He tilted his head, and Peter&rsquo;s heart skipped a beat when he realized Tony Stark was&hellip; <i>crying</i>?</p><p>And <i>he </i>was the cause of it.</p><p><i>Why </i>did Peter tell Tony?</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to lose you.&rdquo; Tony whispered that last line, and that was when Peter&rsquo;s heart finally shattered. He stumbled forwards to wrap his arms around his dad, though the arrangement they had was more so Tony hugging Peter.</p><p>He clutched an arm tightly around his kid&rsquo;s back, a hand threading through his curls, as Peter buried his face in his dad&rsquo;s chest. He listened to the sound of his heart beating faster than it should&rsquo;ve been as they held each other tightly.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going anywhere.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony just tightened his hold.</p><p>&ldquo;You almost did,&rdquo; Tony muttered, rubbing circles onto Peter&rsquo;s back, and Peter tensed at the reminder.</p><p>He <i>hated </i>that he was hurting his dad like this. How could he explain that he didn&rsquo;t feel like he had a choice? That it felt as though everything was crashing down on him, crushing him from the inside? That everything was going wrong and it felt like nothing would ever go right again?</p><p>That if he lived another minute he felt like he would fade to nothing&hellip;</p><p>and no one would care?</p><p>&ldquo;Why&rsquo;d you want to keep me in my room?&rdquo; Peter mumbled into Tony&rsquo;s chest, eyes partially closed, feeling safe and comforted in his dad&rsquo;s arms. Tony took a while to respond.</p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know if you would try to&hellip;.&rdquo; Tony sighed deeply before finding the word. &ldquo;<i>Leave</i>.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter&rsquo;s breath hitched in his throat.

        "body": "<p><b><i>Warning: this story is based heavily around suicide, including suicidal thoughts and attempts. Please be careful!! &lt;3</i></b></p><hr><p>Tony noticed Peter\u2019s eyes trained on the ground the entire way to the park - even as they passed all the buildings he used to love, all the people he used to smile at, the dogs he loved to meet, and, Tony noticed with a pang in his chest, the pretzel stand just outside the entrance Peter used to love to visit.</p><p>He watched as Peter trudged past it without a second glance, barely looking up as he took his first step into the park.</p><p>\u201cHey, Pete,\u201d Tony called, Peter looking up in vague confusion and surprise. Tony couldn\u2019t help but notice he looked\u2026 <i>lost</i>. Not mentally, but literally. Like he had forgotten how he had gotten there.</p><p>\u201cPretzel?\u201d</p><p>Tony gestured his hand to the stand behind him, hoping to see some recognition in the kid\u2019s face.</p><p>He was sincerely disappointed.</p><!-- more --><p>Peter looked up at the pretzel stand after quickly scanning his surroundings.</p><p><i>How had he gotten to the park?</i></p><p>He was walking, and then\u2026</p><p>How long ago did he leave the tower?</p><p>Wait, today was <i>Wednesday</i>! Why wasn\u2019t Peter at school?</p><p>Gosh, Tony would be <i>so mad </i>Peter was skipping.</p><p>Why was Peter skipping?</p><p>Wait, Tony had asked him a question.</p><p>Wait, Tony was <i>right in front </i>of him.</p><p><i>Oh</i>.</p><p>Central Park.</p><p>Peter\u2019s breakdown.</p><p>The memories came rushing back, causing Peter\u2019s vision to spin momentarily as a minor headache pierced his skull.</p><p>Okay, Tony\u2019s question. Something about a\u2026</p><p><i>pretzel?</i></p><p>Hundreds of memories bubbled to the surface of Peter\u2019s mind when he noticed <i>Pablo\u2019s Pretzel Stand </i>printed on the small shack Tony was gesturing to, the yellow and blue sign seeming to call to him and beckon him closer. Peter\u2019s grade eight graduation, when he won his first Decathlon - so many happy memories were associated with this one place.</p><p>Which is why Peter expected to feel some kind of connection to it. A smile would come across his face before he could stop it and he would bound over, begging Tony to buy him a huge, salty pretzel as his heart filled with joy and happiness.</p><p>But it never came.</p><p>Peter <i>wanted</i> to feel happy.</p><p>He <i>wanted </i>to feel a sense of <i>connection </i>to this place.</p><p>He should be feeling <i>something</i>, right? I mean, this one pretzel stand held so many memories for him; it would be ludicrous for him to feel an empty, gaping hole in the middle of his chest, the once bright letters seeming dull, as he wondered how he felt such a lack of emotion in something that used to bring so much joy could be possible.</p><p>But that was exactly what he was feeling.</p><p>And it terrified him.</p><p>Peter forced a smile to cross his features, cringing at how difficult it seemed to be to force one to the surface.</p><p>\u201cNo thank you, Mr. Stark.\u201d</p><p>Peter noticed the look of disappointment that crossed Tony\u2019s face, but rather decided to ignore it. He knew Tony hated him. He knew he was disappointed. Peter understood that it was a burden, that Tony having to give up his entire day just to spend time with one insignificant child was a terrible waste of time. He wasn\u2019t going to waste Tony\u2019s money, too. Not on something as stupid and childish as a pretzel.</p><p>\u201cWell, come on.\u201d Tony clasped a hand on Peter\u2019s shoulder and Peter almost toppled under the sudden weight. He had been feeling weak lately, but he had never noticed how weak he had actually <i>become</i>. \u201cYou wanted to see the park?\u201d</p><p>Peter looked up at him with a faltering smile and eyes that seemed to scream <i>help me</i>, before nodding weakly and taking his first step into the park.</p><p>Immediately after entering the shadows of the trees, Peter felt his whole demeanor lift.</p><p>The sounds of the city seemed to quiet as soon as Peter took that first step under the canopy of the trees, all that was left to be heard being the faint rustling of leaves and birds happily tweeting somewhere deeper within the park.</p><p>Peter found himself getting lost as the cool fall breeze caressed his face, the sunlight filtering through the thick canopies of trees blinding him with every second step. He felt Tony\u2019s presence beside him and he knew a conversation was coming, but for the moment he just tried to enjoy it - him and his mentor, him and his <i>dad</i>, enjoying the beautiful scene before them that was <i>nature</i>.</p><p>Peter always loved being out in nature. The fact that so much could grow - tree roots burrowing deep into the ground, flowers peeking through rocks in the earth, just reminded Peter that if nature could fight to live on, maybe he could, too.</p><p>Though, his plan wasn\u2019t going so well. Peter had hoped the walk through nature would remind him that he was strong, that he <i>could </i>do this, but all it seemed to be reminding him was that nature could succeed. <i>Nature </i>was strong enough to live on.</p><p>But Peter couldn\u2019t.</p><p>Peter paled in comparison.</p><p>Suddenly, the nature that had seemed so inspiring just a minute ago was taunting him now, just proving that Peter was weak. That Peter couldn\u2019t be strong, that he would never <i>amount </i>to anything. </p><p>If he even stayed alive that long to put in the work to.</p><p>Tony watched Peter\u2019s face change from calm, to anxious, to <i>distress </i>as his shoes lightly slapped on the path. He desperately wanted to reach out and start the conversation, but he had tried that. It hadn\u2019t worked.</p><p>Maybe he would try letting his kid come to <i>him</i>. After all, he knew how open Peter was about his feelings (or, used to be). He hoped Peter would come to him on his own time. And if he didn\u2019t, well, Tony would have no choice but to use his own methods, because he couldn\u2019t let Peter walk around with those <i>horrors </i>in his head any longer.</p><p>Just the thought of it made Tony want to cry. His kid had done that. His kid had thought he had no other choice but to <i>die</i>. And that was a fucking terrifying thought.</p><p>Tony would give Peter the day. This one day to let the kid talk to him. He wouldn\u2019t let Peter out of his sight, and by the end of it, if Peter still didn\u2019t want to communicate on his own terms, Tony would talk to him on his. Either way, Tony was ending this <i>today</i>.</p><p>They walked through the park quietly, Peter\u2019s eyes turning this way and that, and Tony tried to ignore how sad and <i>lost </i>they looked whenever they looked in Tony\u2019s direction. Tony, in turn, had his eyes trained solely on the kid. He had walked through the park before. He knew what it looked like. But even if he hadn\u2019t, if this had been his first time seeing it, Tony knew he would still only have eyes for the kid. Peter was the only thing that mattered.</p><p>Tony was glad it was a Wednesday, where kids were at school and adults at work. The two got to walk through the park mainly undisturbed, and Tony was eternally grateful, because he wasn\u2019t sure how the kid would fare with people everywhere. He knew that as much as Peter liked spending time with Tony and having that personal connection, strangers were a large cause of anxiety, and Tony wanted him as calm as possible.</p><p><i>Maybe I\u2019ll make my own Central Park</i>, Tony found himself thinking. <i>I\u2019ve got the money. I\u2019ll call is Central Parker</i>. Tony laughed at his own joke and immediately turned to repeat it out loud for Peter, but stopped when he almost ran into the kid.</p><p>Peter had stopped walking and was staring down at something in the pavement, bent down as he held out a hesitant hand. Tony slowly joined him on the ground, close enough to provide support, but not enough to be suffocating.</p><p>Peter\u2019s hand was held just inches away from a light lavender flower, a generic-looking one that every child drew in their pictures. <i>Cosmos</i>, Tony remembered from when his mother had taken him to this very same park when he was young, walking around with the wide-eyed boy, pointing out every unique piece of nature they came across.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a cosmos flower,\u201d he murmured quietly, his mother saying the exact same words to him forty years ago. It was amazing how clearly he could remember the words, the voice. They put a smile on his face as he continued with the speech. \u201cMeans beautiful and orderly in Greek.\u201d He paused a moment to let Peter reach out and gently caress the soft petals like Tony himself had done as a small child.</p><p>\u201cBut typically, it means \u2018love flower\u2019.\u201d</p><p>Slowly, Peter withdrew his hand from the petals, but continued to rest back on his heels and just stare at it, growing alone, isolated, but strongly amongst the gravel of the path. The park was quiet around them, seeming to hold its breath as it looked down upon the two, crouched around the flower. There was no one else in sight, but even if there was, Tony wouldn\u2019t have cared.</p><p>He didn\u2019t think about how it would look to see the great Tony Stark and a young boy kneeling in the middle of Central Park around a single flower. All that mattered to him was remembering the speech his mother had told him so many years ago, and finishing it for his own son.</p><p>Slowly, Tony reached out and gingerly twisted the stem of the flower until it pulled free from its roots. \u201c\u2018<i>Used to illustrate one\u2019s deepest feelings of love</i>,\u2019\u201d he repeated from the Google search he had done not too long ago.</p><p>That conversation with his mother had never left his mind, but during these last few years with Peter it had seemed to grow more and more important, and he had done some more research on those flowers, wondering if they had really represented everything Maria Stark had once told him.</p><p>They had. And so much more.</p><p>Tony slowly reached forwards to loop the stem into Peter\u2019s curls, knowing he wouldn\u2019t be opposed to the open display of affection.</p><p>So he was surprised when Peter jolted away, tears forming in his eyes.</p><p>Tony let the flower fall to the ground, forgotten, as he gently leaned forward to rest his hands on the kid\u2019s shoulders, eyes wide and eyebrows furrowing in confusion.</p><p>\u201cPete?\u201d he spoke softly as the kid looked up at him, looking\u2026 <i>hurt</i>?</p><p>\u201cYou killed it,\u201d he whispered, looking betrayed, and Tony looked back at him, horrified. <i>What had he killed? </i>Oh gosh, what had he <i>killed</i>?</p><p>\u201cThe flower,\u201d Peter continued quietly, and Tony\u2019s heart sunk in his chest. \u201cYou just\u2026 killed it.\u201d</p><p>Tony looked down at where it had been discarded on the floor. Peter was caring about\u2026 a <i>flower</i>? He knew Peter was sensitive. He didn\u2019t know the <i>flower </i>would upset him.</p><p>Until suddenly, it clicked into place.</p><p>Why Peter stopped to look at the flower in the first place.</p><p>\u201cPeter, what did you see in that flower?\u201d He let his hands fall into his lap as he let the kid collect himself, first looking down painfully at the flower, then up at Tony.</p><p>\u201cIt was strong,\u201d he whispered, almost to himself. Tony had to strain to hear him, his eyes softening at the raw <i>emotion </i>in Peter\u2019s voice.</p><p>\u201cIt was alone,\u201d he continued, looking back to where the flower lay, and suddenly the colours looked a lot less vibrant. \u201cBut it was <i>growing</i>. And it was <i>surviving</i>, and you - you-\u201d</p><p>A feeling of <i>betrayal </i>came over Peter. As soon as he saw that flower, he recognized <i>himself</i>. Alone, abandoned, in the middle of the path. The colours weren\u2019t exceptionally bright, but the flower was still shining, still <i>growing</i>, despite the dry terrain around it.</p><p>And Mr. Stark had came along, despite all the flower\u2019s efforts to fight and grow and <i>live</i>, he had just pulled it out of the ground. Let it <i>wilt </i>and <i>die</i>.</p><p>Suddenly, Peter\u2019s thinking did a complete 180\u00b0 turn.</p><p>Peter was crying.</p><p>Over a stinking <i>flower</i>.</p><p>What the heck was <i>wrong </i>with him?</p><p>Oh, geez, he had just accused Tony of killing - of killing a damn <i>flower</i>.</p><p><i>What the heck?</i></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Peter sighed, looking down, dejected, ashamed, as suddenly he wasn\u2019t feeling sad, he was just feeling\u2026 what was it, frustrated? With <i>himself</i>?</p><p>Why were feelings so<i> confusing</i>?</p><p>Geez, if Tony didn\u2019t hate him before, he <i>definitely </i>did now.</p><p>\u201cKid.\u201d Tony\u2019s voice pierced his thoughts, but Peter refused to look up. He just accused Tony of being a <i>murderer</i>. He was sure his face was flushed bright red.</p><p>Was it too late to run away?</p><p>Peter buried his face in his hands and pressed down, <i>hard</i>, wanting to just squish himself out of existence.</p><p>But that didn\u2019t work.</p><p>He ran his hands up into his hair, threaded them through, and <i>pulled</i>.</p><p>Stupid, stupid, <i>stupid</i>-</p><p>\u201cPeter, <i>geez</i>, kid-\u201d</p><p>Tony\u2019s hands wrapped around Peter\u2019s wrists and tried to pull them out, but Peter was holding fast. He didn\u2019t deserve Tony\u2019s sympathy, he didn\u2019t deserve <i>Tony</i>-</p><p>\u201cJust let me die.\u201d</p><p>Tony\u2019s hands froze, and Peter realized he had said that <i>out loud</i>.</p><p>Crap.</p><p>That wasn\u2019t a joke to be made in a situation like this, that wasn\u2019t appropriate-</p><p>But now Peter just wanted to die <i>more</i>.</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>Wait, since when did Peter <i>swear</i>?</p><p>\u201cOh, kid,\u201d Tony sighed, and Peter let his hands fall from his hair, too exhausted to keep pulling. He didn\u2019t even know <i>why </i>he was tired, but suddenly he was falling forwards, sobbing into Tony\u2019s arms - and Tony let him.</p><p>He caught the kid and held him to his chest, rested his chin over Peter\u2019s head, and let one hand thread through his curls while the other ran circles on his back.</p><p>He felt Peter\u2019s body shake with the weight of his sobs, Tony\u2019s shirt being soaked with tears, and his heart panged with sadness. He didn\u2019t know having a kid could hurt <i>this much</i>.</p><p>As he held his kid, sobbing, Tony knew this wasn\u2019t his fault. Not all of it, at least. He knew depression didn\u2019t pick its victims. It struck whoever was nearby, not caring who they were, what they had done.</p><p>If depression cared, if it was <i>fair</i>, Peter would be flying high as a kite right now while Tony, ever deserving, would be lying in a ditch.</p><p>But depression <i>didn\u2019t</i> care, and Peter, the kid, the <i>person</i>, who deserved this least in the world, was being forced to carry a burden he should\u2019ve never had to.</p><p>And Tony felt like this, like having to <i>cradle </i>his sobbing kid in his arms, was a hundred times worse than anything depression could throw at him directly.</p><p>Gently, Tony supported Peter\u2019s weight and guided him up to sit on a nearby park bench, sneaking the flower into his back pocket on the way. He set Peter on the bench beside him and let the kid lean into his shoulders, the sobs subsiding slightly, the occasional sniffle being the only sound between the two.</p><p>Tony\u2019s heart ached for the kid, and he wished he could take his pain away. Peter didn\u2019t deserve <i>any </i>of this, not one bit, and when he finally heard the sniffles subside to a few soft gasps, he decided now was the time to show the kid how much he cared.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened, Petey?\u201d he murmured, rubbing a comforting hand along Peter\u2019s arm, letting the kid lean into his side and rest his head against Tony\u2019s shoulder. Peter just turned his head and buried it into Tony\u2019s neck, and Tony\u2019s heart <i>melted </i>at the touch. He hated to put Peter through this, to force him to face his inner demons, but the sun always came after the storm. So he just needed to push through.</p><p>\u201cI know it sucks, Pete, I know,\u201d he muttered into his kid\u2019s matted curls, and Peter let out a shuddering breath. \u201cI just want to help you. Please, let me help you.\u201d</p><p>Peter burrowed his head deeper into Tony\u2019s shoulder, hoping Tony would shield him (from what, neither one knew), and Tony let him. He would protect his kid from anything, <i>everything</i>, he could. But it pained him to know, that this problem was one Tony couldn\u2019t protect him from.</p><p>But he would try.</p><p>Tony waited quietly, knowing Peter was just gathering the courage to speak. His hand found its way into Peter\u2019s curls, knowing how much Peter loved the touch, and he smiled when Peter let out a contented sigh.</p><p>At least he could do that much for his kid.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know where to start,\u201d he whispered, tears returning to his eyes - and that was the truth. Peter had no idea what he was thinking, what he was <i>feeling </i>- how was he supposed to express it to someone else? How was he supposed to tell someone who he looked up to greatly? His idol? His <i>dad</i>? How would Tony look at him when he finished?</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay, kid.\u201d Tony moved his fingers so he was massaging Peter\u2019s scalp, and he loved the way he leaned into Tony\u2019s touch. \u201cJust tell me whatever\u2019s on your mind right now. I promise you I won\u2019t think any less of you. I love you, kid, okay? No matter what.\u201d</p><p>Peter nodded slowly and took a deep breath. Whatever was on his mind.</p><p>But <i>what </i>was on his mind?</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he whispered, the entirety of his weight on Tony now, too exhausted to hold himself up. \u201cI don\u2019t know, I - I can\u2019t think, and I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m feeling, and I-\u201d</p><p>He collapsed into tears, but they were more quiet now, Peter being too mentally exhausted to make a noise.</p><p>\u201cPeter,\u201d Tony found himself whispering once again. \u201cBreathe, bimbo mio, breathe.\u201d</p><p>Tony rarely used that word. It was one his mother had used on him multiple times, <i>my child</i>, but he had never felt like the time had been right to use it on Peter - until now. Clearly, Peter had recognized the affection behind the words and took another shuddering breath.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m feeling,\u201d he tried again, squeezing his eyes shut, trying to focus - to gather his thoughts.</p><p>He hated that he couldn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cSometimes I get these thoughts, but I - I can\u2019t control them. Like, the flower?\u201d He took a breath. \u201cI don\u2019t know what came over me, I just - it reminded me of, of <i>me</i>, and then you pulled it out of the ground, and it wasn\u2019t your <i>fault </i>but I still got mad when I had no reason to be and I accused you of being a <i>murderer</i> and that was so <i>mean </i>and, please don\u2019t hate me, I\u2019m sorry - Mr. Stark, I am <i>so sorry</i>-\u201d</p><p>Peter was crying now, gasping for air, shuddering through his tears. He found himself subconsciously curling in closer to Tony, trying to find protection, comfort, in the man\u2019s arms.</p><p>Tony was telling him something, something about him being okay, him being <i>brave</i>, but Peter really didn\u2019t feel brave, not in the slightest. <i>I\u2019m weak</i>, he wanted to argue back, but he had no strength. His limbs felt like they were strapped to weights, useless at his sides. There was a cloud of darkness around his mind, squeezing, suffocating, and he just wanted it to be over, he just wanted it all to <i>end</i>-</p><p>And this was exactly what he found himself telling Tony.</p><p>\u201cLife is hard,\u201d he gasped out, cutting Tony off. Tony closed his mouth immediately, just content that his kid was actually talking again.</p><p>\u201cWell, I mean, it\u2019s not - it\u2019s not <i>hard</i>,\u201d he tried to explain, but he couldn\u2019t. He <i>couldn\u2019t</i>. And he hated it.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not hard, especially not for me, I have it pretty good. I mean, I have powers, I\u2019m <i>Spiderman</i>, and it\u2019s awesome, and I have you, Mr. Stark, and Ned, and MJ, but I don\u2019t know why it\u2019s so hard, and I know I seem so ungrateful, but I\u2019m not, I am so, <i>so </i>grateful for everything and all of you but my mind just <i>won\u2019t let me be</i>-\u201d</p><p>He took a minute to breathe, his eyes still squeezed shut tight, feeling Mr. Stark\u2019s shoulders rise and fall gently beneath him, letting the motion sooth him.</p><p>\u201cI want to be happy,\u201d he murmured, slower now - more in control. \u201cI want to be, and I really <i>should </i>be, but I\u2019m just <i>not</i>. I mean, some days I am. And some days I\u2019m really happy, but others I don\u2019t even want to get out of bed, and there\u2019s no reason for it, and sometimes we\u2019re working in the lab and I\u2019ll be fine but suddenly I\u2019ll drop a screw or something and I\u2019ll just fall apart, and I don\u2019t know what it is, Mr. Stark, but I promise you I\u2019m trying to be better, and I <i>will </i>be better, I swear, and I\u2019m sorry for all this, and I\u2019m sorry you have to <i>deal </i>with this, but it\u2019s not my choice I swear and I\u2019m trying to be good and I promise you I can be good-\u201d</p><p>Tony was taken aback by how much Peter was talking. Tears began to form in his eyes. He had guessed it was bad, for Peter to want to take such\u2026 <i>drastic </i>measures, but he had never known, had never even fathomed how <i>hard </i>it had actually been. All those times Peter had used the excuse of just being tired, when he would wake up late and slide his feet on the tile while walking, too tired to pick them up-</p><p>How many calls for help had Tony missed?</p><p>Scratch that statement from earlier. Tony was <i>definitely </i>to blame for Peter\u2019s state.</p><p>Peter lay curled into Tony\u2019s side. The cool air no longer provided refreshing comfort to him - it now just made him feel exposed, and Tony was now the only barrier between Peter and the dangers out there. So he held him close, tears streaming down his face, Peter\u2019s mind seeming to quiet.</p><p>Though, he found the quiet mind was worse than the loud one.</p><p>At least the loud mind was distracting. There was always something to think about, to try to process.</p><p>The quiet mind was\u2026 <i>quiet</i>. There was nothing to process. There was nothing to prevent the horrid thoughts that were constantly trying to fight their way in.</p><p>Like right now.</p><p>He might as well tell Tony, right? All or nothing. Tony probably hated him by now, anyways. There would be no (extra) harm in telling him more. And he wanted, <i>needed</i>, to get it off his chest, anyways.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s especially bad now,\u201d he spoke stronger, like it was a fact. \u201cI don\u2019t even know why, but sometimes my mind is quiet and other times it\u2019s loud, and right now it\u2019s quiet, so it\u2019s just me versus my thoughts, and my thoughts are winning.\u201d</p><p>Tony tensed beside his kid. Peter sounded\u2026 dull. Empty. Void of emotion. And when he was crying just a minute ago\u2026 what did that <i>mean</i>?</p><p>\u201cWhat are your thoughts saying?\u201d Tony asked, though he wasn\u2019t sure he wanted to know the answer.</p><p>Peter was terrified to tell him.</p><p>He had been keeping these thoughts a secret for so long, hiding the horrors of his mind, and he wondered if he would even be able to speak them out loud.</p><p>\u201cYou are so strong, bimbo mio.\u201d There was that word again.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re saying\u2026.\u201d Peter squeezed his eyes tighter. Last chance to act like he\u2019s fine. <i>My thoughts aren\u2019t saying anything at the moment! False alarm, all\u2019s good!</i></p><p>But this was Tony. Tony would see right through him.</p><p>And he <i>does </i>want to tell someone. More than anything, he <i>desperately </i>wants to tell someone, to actually cry out for help.</p><p>And who better than Mr. Stark?</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re telling me to-\u201d A shuddering breath. \u201cThey\u2019re telling me to leave the park, and to go on - onto the road, and, um, l-lie down-\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeter.\u201d Tony\u2019s voice was strong, demanding, and Peter flinched as Tony\u2019s arm tightened over his shoulder.</p><p>He turned his head to look back at Tony, and the fierceness he saw in the man\u2019s eyes made him want to shrink back in fear. He had seen this look before, directed at villains or at the press when they got too personal, but Peter never expected it would be directed at <i>him</i>.</p><p>\u201cYou <i>never </i>say anything like that <i>again</i>.\u201d Peter was quick to nod, the arm around his shoulders feeling more restricting than comforting now.</p><p>He had expected Tony to be disgusted with him. To leave him, because he wasn\u2019t willing to put in the work to help him heal. No one was.</p><p>He had never expected <i>anger</i>.</p><p>Anger directed at <i>him</i>.</p><p>Suddenly, Tony\u2019s eyes softened, and he pulled lightly on Peter\u2019s shoulders, letting the kid fall into his side. Peter did reluctantly, only because he knew how upset Tony was with him, and he didn\u2019t want want to risk making it any worse.</p><p>\u201cPeter.\u201d The boy was taken aback at the sudden softness in his voice. It sounded like Tony was\u2026 <i>crying</i>? \u201cYou promise me-\u201d A pause. A loud swallow. \u201cYou <i>promise </i>me that you will never, <i>ever</i> listen to that voice, okay?\u201d</p><p>Slowly, in a state of sluggish movement, Peter nodded his head, but Tony\u2019s grip just tightened.</p><p>\u201c<i>Promise </i>me.\u201d</p><p>Peter had never heard such passion in the man\u2019s voice, but he knew why Tony was asking for this specifically.</p><p>Peter never went back on his promises.</p><p>And Tony knew.</p><p>Tentatively, not knowing if a time would come when he would go back on that promise, Peter spoke up.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I promise.\u201d</p><p>Tony\u2019s arm went slack and he sighed deeply, Peter not being able to decide between relaxing in the grasp of his mentor, or tensing in memory of the fire he had heard in Tony\u2019s voice.</p><p>He decided on relaxing, knowing (hoping) that Tony only wanted to protect him, and now that Tony knew, now that he <i>understood</i>, he would be more gentle, more considerate.</p><p>Peter was wrong.</p>",

Something about a\u2026</p><p><i>pretzel?</i></p><p>Hundreds of memories bubbled to the surface of Peter\u2019s mind when he noticed <i>Pablo\u2019s Pretzel Stand </i>printed on the small shack Tony was gesturing to, the yellow and blue sign seeming to call to him and beckon him closer. Peter\u2019s grade eight graduation, when he won his first Decathlon - so many happy memories were associated with this one place.</p><p>Which is why Peter expected to feel some kind of connection to it. A smile would come across his face before he could stop it and he would bound over, begging Tony to buy him a huge, salty pretzel as his heart filled with joy and happiness.</p><p>But it never came.</p><p>Peter <i>wanted</i> to feel happy.</p><p>He <i>wanted </i>to feel a sense of <i>connection </i>to this place.</p><p>He should be feeling <i>something</i>, right? I mean, this one pretzel stand held so many memories for him; it would be ludicrous for him to feel an empty, gaping hole in the middle of his chest, the once bright letters seeming dull, as he wondered how he felt such a lack of emotion in something that used to bring so much joy could be possible.</p><p>But that was exactly what he was feeling.</p><p>And it terrified him.</p><p>Peter forced a smile to cross his features, cringing at how difficult it seemed to be to force one to the surface.</p><p>\u201cNo thank you, Mr. Stark.\u201d</p><p>Peter noticed the look of disappointment that crossed Tony\u2019s face, but rather decided to ignore it. He knew Tony hated him. He knew he was disappointed. Peter understood that it was a burden, that Tony having to give up his entire day just to spend time with one insignificant child was a terrible waste of time. He wasn\u2019t going to waste Tony\u2019s money, too. Not on something as stupid and childish as a pretzel.</p><p>\u201cWell, come on.\u201d Tony clasped a hand on Peter\u2019s shoulder and Peter almost toppled under the sudden weight. He had been feeling weak lately, but he had never noticed how weak he had actually <i>become</i>. \u201cYou wanted to see the park?\u201d</p><p>Peter looked up at him with a faltering smile and eyes that seemed to scream <i>help me</i>, before nodding weakly and taking his first step into the park.</p><p>Immediately after entering the shadows of the trees, Peter felt his whole demeanor lift.</p><p>The sounds of the city seemed to quiet as soon as Peter took that first step under the canopy of the trees, all that was left to be heard being the faint rustling of leaves and birds happily tweeting somewhere deeper within the park.</p><p>Peter found himself getting lost as the cool fall breeze caressed his face, the sunlight filtering through the thick canopies of trees blinding him with every second step. He felt Tony\u2019s presence beside him and he knew a conversation was coming, but for the moment he just tried to enjoy it - him and his mentor, him and his <i>dad</i>, enjoying the beautiful scene before them that was <i>nature</i>.</p><p>Peter always loved being out in nature. The fact that so much could grow - tree roots burrowing deep into the ground, flowers peeking through rocks in the earth, just reminded Peter that if nature could fight to live on, maybe he could, too.</p><p>Though, his plan wasn\u2019t going so well. Peter had hoped the walk through nature would remind him that he was strong, that he <i>could </i>do this, but all it seemed to be reminding him was that nature could succeed. <i>Nature </i>was strong enough to live on.</p><p>But Peter couldn\u2019t.</p><p>Peter paled in comparison.</p><p>Suddenly, the nature that had seemed so inspiring just a minute ago was taunting him now, just proving that Peter was weak. That Peter couldn\u2019t be strong, that he would never <i>amount </i>to anything. </p><p>If he even stayed alive that long to put in the work to.</p><p>Tony watched Peter\u2019s face change from calm, to anxious, to <i>distress </i>as his shoes lightly slapped on the path. He desperately wanted to reach out and start the conversation, but he had tried that. It hadn\u2019t worked.</p><p>Maybe he would try letting his kid come to <i>him</i>. After all, he knew how open Peter was about his feelings (or, used to be). He hoped Peter would come to him on his own time. And if he didn\u2019t, well, Tony would have no choice but to use his own methods, because he couldn\u2019t let Peter walk around with those <i>horrors </i>in his head any longer.</p><p>Just the thought of it made Tony want to cry. His kid had done that. His kid had thought he had no other choice but to <i>die</i>. And that was a fucking terrifying thought.</p><p>Tony would give Peter the day. This one day to let the kid talk to him. He wouldn\u2019t let Peter out of his sight, and by the end of it, if Peter still didn\u2019t want to communicate on his own terms, Tony would talk to him on his. Either way, Tony was ending this <i>today</i>.</p><p>They walked through the park quietly, Peter\u2019s eyes turning this way and that, and Tony tried to ignore how sad and <i>lost </i>they looked whenever they looked in Tony\u2019s direction. Tony, in turn, had his eyes trained solely on the kid. He had walked through the park before. He knew what it looked like. But even if he hadn\u2019t, if this had been his first time seeing it, Tony knew he would still only have eyes for the kid. Peter was the only thing that mattered.</p><p>Tony was glad it was a Wednesday, where kids were at school and adults at work. The two got to walk through the park mainly undisturbed, and Tony was eternally grateful, because he wasn\u2019t sure how the kid would fare with people everywhere. He knew that as much as Peter liked spending time with Tony and having that personal connection, strangers were a large cause of anxiety, and Tony wanted him as calm as possible.</p><p><i>Maybe I\u2019ll make my own Central Park</i>, Tony found himself thinking. <i>I\u2019ve got the money. I\u2019ll call is Central Parker</i>. Tony laughed at his own joke and immediately turned to repeat it out loud for Peter, but stopped when he almost ran into the kid.</p><p>Peter had stopped walking and was staring down at something in the pavement, bent down as he held out a hesitant hand. Tony slowly joined him on the ground, close enough to provide support, but not enough to be suffocating.</p><p>Peter\u2019s hand was held just inches away from a light lavender flower, a generic-looking one that every child drew in their pictures. <i>Cosmos</i>, Tony remembered from when his mother had taken him to this very same park when he was young, walking around with the wide-eyed boy, pointing out every unique piece of nature they came across.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a cosmos flower,\u201d he murmured quietly, his mother saying the exact same words to him forty years ago. It was amazing how clearly he could remember the words, the voice. They put a smile on his face as he continued with the speech. \u201cMeans beautiful and orderly in Greek.\u201d He paused a moment to let Peter reach out and gently caress the soft petals like Tony himself had done as a small child.</p><p>\u201cBut typically, it means \u2018love flower\u2019.\u201d</p><p>Slowly, Peter withdrew his hand from the petals, but continued to rest back on his heels and just stare at it, growing alone, isolated, but strongly amongst the gravel of the path. The park was quiet around them, seeming to hold its breath as it looked down upon the two, crouched around the flower. There was no one else in sight, but even if there was, Tony wouldn\u2019t have cared.</p><p>He didn\u2019t think about how it would look to see the great Tony Stark and a young boy kneeling in the middle of Central Park around a single flower. All that mattered to him was remembering the speech his mother had told him so many years ago, and finishing it for his own son.</p><p>Slowly, Tony reached out and gingerly twisted the stem of the flower until it pulled free from its roots. \u201c\u2018<i>Used to illustrate one\u2019s deepest feelings of love</i>,\u2019\u201d he repeated from the Google search he had done not too long ago.</p><p>That conversation with his mother had never left his mind, but during these last few years with Peter it had seemed to grow more and more important, and he had done some more research on those flowers, wondering if they had really represented everything Maria Stark had once told him.</p><p>They had. And so much more.</p><p>Tony slowly reached forwards to loop the stem into Peter\u2019s curls, knowing he wouldn\u2019t be opposed to the open display of affection.</p><p>So he was surprised when Peter jolted away, tears forming in his eyes.</p><p>Tony let the flower fall to the ground, forgotten, as he gently leaned forward to rest his hands on the kid\u2019s shoulders, eyes wide and eyebrows furrowing in confusion.</p><p>\u201cPete?\u201d he spoke softly as the kid looked up at him, looking\u2026 <i>hurt</i>?</p><p>\u201cYou killed it,\u201d he whispered, looking betrayed, and Tony looked back at him, horrified. <i>What had he killed? </i>Oh gosh, what had he <i>killed</i>?</p><p>\u201cThe flower,\u201d Peter continued quietly, and Tony\u2019s heart sunk in his chest. \u201cYou just\u2026 killed it.\u201d</p><p>Tony looked down at where it had been discarded on the floor. Peter was caring about\u2026 a <i>flower</i>? He knew Peter was sensitive. He didn\u2019t know the <i>flower </i>would upset him.</p><p>Until suddenly, it clicked into place.</p><p>Why Peter stopped to look at the flower in the first place.</p><p>\u201cPeter, what did you see in that flower?\u201d He let his hands fall into his lap as he let the kid collect himself, first looking down painfully at the flower, then up at Tony.</p><p>\u201cIt was strong,\u201d he whispered, almost to himself. Tony had to strain to hear him, his eyes softening at the raw <i>emotion </i>in Peter\u2019s voice.</p><p>\u201cIt was alone,\u201d he continued, looking back to where the flower lay, and suddenly the colours looked a lot less vibrant. \u201cBut it was <i>growing</i>. And it was <i>surviving</i>, and you - you-\u201d</p><p>A feeling of <i>betrayal </i>came over Peter. As soon as he saw that flower, he recognized <i>himself</i>. Alone, abandoned, in the middle of the path. The colours weren\u2019t exceptionally bright, but the flower was still shining, still <i>growing</i>, despite the dry terrain around it.</p><p>And Mr. Stark had came along, despite all the flower\u2019s efforts to fight and grow and <i>live</i>, he had just pulled it out of the ground. Let it <i>wilt </i>and <i>die</i>.</p><p>Suddenly, Peter\u2019s thinking did a complete 180\u00b0 turn.</p><p>Peter was crying.</p><p>Over a stinking <i>flower</i>.</p><p>What the heck was <i>wrong </i>with him?</p><p>Oh, geez, he had just accused Tony of killing - of killing a damn <i>flower</i>.</p><p><i>What the heck?</i></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Peter sighed, looking down, dejected, ashamed, as suddenly he wasn\u2019t feeling sad, he was just feeling\u2026 what was it, frustrated? With <i>himself</i>?</p><p>Why were feelings so<i> confusing</i>?</p><p>Geez, if Tony didn\u2019t hate him before, he <i>definitely </i>did now.</p><p>\u201cKid.\u201d Tony\u2019s voice pierced his thoughts, but Peter refused to look up. He just accused Tony of being a <i>murderer</i>. He was sure his face was flushed bright red.</p><p>Was it too late to run away?</p><p>Peter buried his face in his hands and pressed down, <i>hard</i>, wanting to just squish himself out of existence.</p><p>But that didn\u2019t work.</p><p>He ran his hands up into his hair, threaded them through, and <i>pulled</i>.</p><p>Stupid, stupid, <i>stupid</i>-</p><p>\u201cPeter, <i>geez</i>, kid-\u201d</p><p>Tony\u2019s hands wrapped around Peter\u2019s wrists and tried to pull them out, but Peter was holding fast. He didn\u2019t deserve Tony\u2019s sympathy, he didn\u2019t deserve <i>Tony</i>-</p><p>\u201cJust let me die.\u201d</p><p>Tony\u2019s hands froze, and Peter realized he had said that <i>out loud</i>.</p><p>Crap.</p><p>That wasn\u2019t a joke to be made in a situation like this, that wasn\u2019t appropriate-</p><p>But now Peter just wanted to die <i>more</i>.</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>Wait, since when did Peter <i>swear</i>?</p><p>\u201cOh, kid,\u201d Tony sighed, and Peter let his hands fall from his hair, too exhausted to keep pulling. He didn\u2019t even know <i>why </i>he was tired, but suddenly he was falling forwards, sobbing into Tony\u2019s arms - and Tony let him.</p><p>He caught the kid and held him to his chest, rested his chin over Peter\u2019s head, and let one hand thread through his curls while the other ran circles on his back.</p><p>He felt Peter\u2019s body shake with the weight of his sobs, Tony\u2019s shirt being soaked with tears, and his heart panged with sadness. He didn\u2019t know having a kid could hurt <i>this much</i>.</p><p>As he held his kid, sobbing, Tony knew this wasn\u2019t his fault. Not all of it, at least. He knew depression didn\u2019t pick its victims. It struck whoever was nearby, not caring who they were, what they had done.</p><p>If depression cared, if it was <i>fair</i>, Peter would be flying high as a kite right now while Tony, ever deserving, would be lying in a ditch.</p><p>But depression <i>didn\u2019t</i> care, and Peter, the kid, the <i>person</i>, who deserved this least in the world, was being forced to carry a burden he should\u2019ve never had to.</p><p>And Tony felt like this, like having to <i>cradle </i>his sobbing kid in his arms, was a hundred times worse than anything depression could throw at him directly.</p><p>Gently, Tony supported Peter\u2019s weight and guided him up to sit on a nearby park bench, sneaking the flower into his back pocket on the way. He set Peter on the bench beside him and let the kid lean into his shoulders, the sobs subsiding slightly, the occasional sniffle being the only sound between the two.</p><p>Tony\u2019s heart ached for the kid, and he wished he could take his pain away. Peter didn\u2019t deserve <i>any </i>of this, not one bit, and when he finally heard the sniffles subside to a few soft gasps, he decided now was the time to show the kid how much he cared.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened, Petey?\u201d he murmured, rubbing a comforting hand along Peter\u2019s arm, letting the kid lean into his side and rest his head against Tony\u2019s shoulder. Peter just turned his head and buried it into Tony\u2019s neck, and Tony\u2019s heart <i>melted </i>at the touch. He hated to put Peter through this, to force him to face his inner demons, but the sun always came after the storm. So he just needed to push through.</p><p>\u201cI know it sucks, Pete, I know,\u201d he muttered into his kid\u2019s matted curls, and Peter let out a shuddering breath. \u201cI just want to help you. Please, let me help you.\u201d</p><p>Peter burrowed his head deeper into Tony\u2019s shoulder, hoping Tony would shield him (from what, neither one knew), and Tony let him. He would protect his kid from anything, <i>everything</i>, he could. But it pained him to know, that this problem was one Tony couldn\u2019t protect him from.</p><p>But he would try.</p><p>Tony waited quietly, knowing Peter was just gathering the courage to speak. His hand found its way into Peter\u2019s curls, knowing how much Peter loved the touch, and he smiled when Peter let out a contented sigh.</p><p>At least he could do that much for his kid.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know where to start,\u201d he whispered, tears returning to his eyes - and that was the truth. Peter had no idea what he was thinking, what he was <i>feeling </i>- how was he supposed to express it to someone else? How was he supposed to tell someone who he looked up to greatly? His idol? His <i>dad</i>? How would Tony look at him when he finished?</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay, kid.\u201d Tony moved his fingers so he was massaging Peter\u2019s scalp, and he loved the way he leaned into Tony\u2019s touch. \u201cJust tell me whatever\u2019s on your mind right now. I promise you I won\u2019t think any less of you. I love you, kid, okay? No matter what.\u201d</p><p>Peter nodded slowly and took a deep breath. Whatever was on his mind.</p><p>But <i>what </i>was on his mind?</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he whispered, the entirety of his weight on Tony now, too exhausted to hold himself up. \u201cI don\u2019t know, I - I can\u2019t think, and I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m feeling, and I-\u201d</p><p>He collapsed into tears, but they were more quiet now, Peter being too mentally exhausted to make a noise.</p><p>\u201cPeter,\u201d Tony found himself whispering once again. \u201cBreathe, bimbo mio, breathe.\u201d</p><p>Tony rarely used that word. It was one his mother had used on him multiple times, <i>my child</i>, but he had never felt like the time had been right to use it on Peter - until now. Clearly, Peter had recognized the affection behind the words and took another shuddering breath.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m feeling,\u201d he tried again, squeezing his eyes shut, trying to focus - to gather his thoughts.</p><p>He hated that he couldn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cSometimes I get these thoughts, but I - I can\u2019t control them. Like, the flower?\u201d He took a breath. \u201cI don\u2019t know what came over me, I just - it reminded me of, of <i>me</i>, and then you pulled it out of the ground, and it wasn\u2019t your <i>fault </i>but I still got mad when I had no reason to be and I accused you of being a <i>murderer</i> and that was so <i>mean </i>and, please don\u2019t hate me, I\u2019m sorry - Mr. Stark, I am <i>so sorry</i>-\u201d</p><p>Peter was crying now, gasping for air, shuddering through his tears. He found himself subconsciously curling in closer to Tony, trying to find protection, comfort, in the man\u2019s arms.</p><p>Tony was telling him something, something about him being okay, him being <i>brave</i>, but Peter really didn\u2019t feel brave, not in the slightest. <i>I\u2019m weak</i>, he wanted to argue back, but he had no strength. His limbs felt like they were strapped to weights, useless at his sides. There was a cloud of darkness around his mind, squeezing, suffocating, and he just wanted it to be over, he just wanted it all to <i>end</i>-</p><p>And this was exactly what he found himself telling Tony.</p><p>\u201cLife is hard,\u201d he gasped out, cutting Tony off. Tony closed his mouth immediately, just content that his kid was actually talking again.</p><p>\u201cWell, I mean, it\u2019s not - it\u2019s not <i>hard</i>,\u201d he tried to explain, but he couldn\u2019t. He <i>couldn\u2019t</i>. And he hated it.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not hard, especially not for me, I have it pretty good. I mean, I have powers, I\u2019m <i>Spiderman</i>, and it\u2019s awesome, and I have you, Mr. Stark, and Ned, and MJ, but I don\u2019t know why it\u2019s so hard, and I know I seem so ungrateful, but I\u2019m not, I am so, <i>so </i>grateful for everything and all of you but my mind just <i>won\u2019t let me be</i>-\u201d</p><p>He took a minute to breathe, his eyes still squeezed shut tight, feeling Mr. Stark\u2019s shoulders rise and fall gently beneath him, letting the motion sooth him.</p><p>\u201cI want to be happy,\u201d he murmured, slower now - more in control. \u201cI want to be, and I really <i>should </i>be, but I\u2019m just <i>not</i>. I mean, some days I am. And some days I\u2019m really happy, but others I don\u2019t even want to get out of bed, and there\u2019s no reason for it, and sometimes we\u2019re working in the lab and I\u2019ll be fine but suddenly I\u2019ll drop a screw or something and I\u2019ll just fall apart, and I don\u2019t know what it is, Mr. Stark, but I promise you I\u2019m trying to be better, and I <i>will </i>be better, I swear, and I\u2019m sorry for all this, and I\u2019m sorry you have to <i>deal </i>with this, but it\u2019s not my choice I swear and I\u2019m trying to be good and I promise you I can be good-\u201d</p><p>Tony was taken aback by how much Peter was talking. Tears began to form in his eyes. He had guessed it was bad, for Peter to want to take such\u2026 <i>drastic </i>measures, but he had never known, had never even fathomed how <i>hard </i>it had actually been. All those times Peter had used the excuse of just being tired, when he would wake up late and slide his feet on the tile while walking, too tired to pick them up-</p><p>How many calls for help had Tony missed?</p><p>Scratch that statement from earlier. Tony was <i>definitely </i>to blame for Peter\u2019s state.</p><p>Peter lay curled into Tony\u2019s side. The cool air no longer provided refreshing comfort to him - it now just made him feel exposed, and Tony was now the only barrier between Peter and the dangers out there. So he held him close, tears streaming down his face, Peter\u2019s mind seeming to quiet.</p><p>Though, he found the quiet mind was worse than the loud one.</p><p>At least the loud mind was distracting. There was always something to think about, to try to process.</p><p>The quiet mind was\u2026 <i>quiet</i>. There was nothing to process. There was nothing to prevent the horrid thoughts that were constantly trying to fight their way in.</p><p>Like right now.</p><p>He might as well tell Tony, right? All or nothing. Tony probably hated him by now, anyways. There would be no (extra) harm in telling him more. And he wanted, <i>needed</i>, to get it off his chest, anyways.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s especially bad now,\u201d he spoke stronger, like it was a fact. \u201cI don\u2019t even know why, but sometimes my mind is quiet and other times it\u2019s loud, and right now it\u2019s quiet, so it\u2019s just me versus my thoughts, and my thoughts are winning.\u201d</p><p>Tony tensed beside his kid. Peter sounded\u2026 dull. Empty. Void of emotion. And when he was crying just a minute ago\u2026 what did that <i>mean</i>?</p><p>\u201cWhat are your thoughts saying?\u201d Tony asked, though he wasn\u2019t sure he wanted to know the answer.</p><p>Peter was terrified to tell him.</p><p>He had been keeping these thoughts a secret for so long, hiding the horrors of his mind, and he wondered if he would even be able to speak them out loud.</p><p>\u201cYou are so strong, bimbo mio.\u201d There was that word again.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re saying\u2026.\u201d Peter squeezed his eyes tighter. Last chance to act like he\u2019s fine. <i>My thoughts aren\u2019t saying anything at the moment! False alarm, all\u2019s good!</i></p><p>But this was Tony. Tony would see right through him.</p><p>And he <i>does </i>want to tell someone. More than anything, he <i>desperately </i>wants to tell someone, to actually cry out for help.</p><p>And who better than Mr. Stark?</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re telling me to-\u201d A shuddering breath. \u201cThey\u2019re telling me to leave the park, and to go on - onto the road, and, um, l-lie down-\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeter.\u201d Tony\u2019s voice was strong, demanding, and Peter flinched as Tony\u2019s arm tightened over his shoulder.</p><p>He turned his head to look back at Tony, and the fierceness he saw in the man\u2019s eyes made him want to shrink back in fear. He had seen this look before, directed at villains or at the press when they got too personal, but Peter never expected it would be directed at <i>him</i>.</p><p>\u201cYou <i>never </i>say anything like that <i>again</i>.\u201d Peter was quick to nod, the arm around his shoulders feeling more restricting than comforting now.</p><p>He had expected Tony to be disgusted with him. To leave him, because he wasn\u2019t willing to put in the work to help him heal. No one was.</p><p>He had never expected <i>anger</i>.</p><p>Anger directed at <i>him</i>.</p><p>Suddenly, Tony\u2019s eyes softened, and he pulled lightly on Peter\u2019s shoulders, letting the kid fall into his side. Peter did reluctantly, only because he knew how upset Tony was with him, and he didn\u2019t want want to risk making it any worse.</p><p>\u201cPeter.\u201d The boy was taken aback at the sudden softness in his voice. It sounded like Tony was\u2026 <i>crying</i>? \u201cYou promise me-\u201d A pause. A loud swallow. \u201cYou <i>promise </i>me that you will never, <i>ever</i> listen to that voice, okay?\u201d</p><p>Slowly, in a state of sluggish movement, Peter nodded his head, but Tony\u2019s grip just tightened.</p><p>\u201c<i>Promise </i>me.\u201d</p><p>Peter had never heard such passion in the man\u2019s voice, but he knew why Tony was asking for this specifically.</p><p>Peter never went back on his promises.</p><p>And Tony knew.</p><p>Tentatively, not knowing if a time would come when he would go back on that promise, Peter spoke up.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I promise.\u201d</p><p>Tony\u2019s arm went slack and he sighed deeply, Peter not being able to decide between relaxing in the grasp of his mentor, or tensing in memory of the fire he had heard in Tony\u2019s voice.</p><p>He decided on relaxing, knowing (hoping) that Tony only wanted to protect him, and now that Tony knew, now that he <i>understood</i>, he would be more gentle, more considerate.</p><p>Peter was wrong.</p>",

Please be careful!! &lt;3</i></b></p><hr><p>Tony noticed Peter\u2019s eyes trained on the ground the entire way to the park - even as they passed all the buildings he used to love, all the people he used to smile at, the dogs he loved to meet, and, Tony noticed with a pang in his chest, the pretzel stand just outside the entrance Peter used to love to visit.</p><p>He watched as Peter trudged past it without a second glance, barely looking up as he took his first step into the park.</p><p>\u201cHey, Pete,\u201d Tony called, Peter looking up in vague confusion and surprise. Tony couldn\u2019t help but notice he looked\u2026 <i>lost</i>. Not mentally, but literally. Like he had forgotten how he had gotten there.</p><p>\u201cPretzel?\u201d</p><p>Tony gestured his hand to the stand behind him, hoping to see some recognition in the kid\u2019s face.</p><p>He was sincerely disappointed.</p>[[MORE]]<p>Peter looked up at the pretzel stand after quickly scanning his surroundings.</p><p><i>How had he gotten to the park?</i></p><p>He was walking, and then\u2026</p><p>How long ago did he leave the tower?</p><p>Wait, today was <i>Wednesday</i>! Why wasn\u2019t Peter at school?</p><p>Gosh, Tony would be <i>so mad </i>Peter was skipping.</p><p>Why was Peter skipping?</p><p>Wait, Tony had asked him a question.</p><p>Wait, Tony was <i>right in front </i>of him.</p><p><i>Oh</i>.</p><p>Central Park.</p><p>Peter\u2019s breakdown.</p><p>The memories came rushing back, causing Peter\u2019s vision to spin momentarily as a minor headache pierced his skull.</p><p>Okay, Tony\u2019s question. Something about a\u2026</p><p><i>pretzel?</i></p><p>Hundreds of memories bubbled to the surface of Peter\u2019s mind when he noticed <i>Pablo\u2019s Pretzel Stand </i>printed on the small shack Tony was gesturing to, the yellow and blue sign seeming to call to him and beckon him closer. Peter\u2019s grade eight graduation, when he won his first Decathlon - so many happy memories were associated with this one place.</p><p>Which is why Peter expected to feel some kind of connection to it. A smile would come across his face before he could stop it and he would bound over, begging Tony to buy him a huge, salty pretzel as his heart filled with joy and happiness.</p><p>But it never came.</p><p>Peter <i>wanted</i> to feel happy.</p><p>He <i>wanted </i>to feel a sense of <i>connection </i>to this place.</p><p>He should be feeling <i>something</i>, right? I mean, this one pretzel stand held so many memories for him; it would be ludicrous for him to feel an empty, gaping hole in the middle of his chest, the once bright letters seeming dull, as he wondered how he felt such a lack of emotion in something that used to bring so much joy could be possible.</p><p>But that was exactly what he was feeling.</p><p>And it terrified him.</p><p>Peter forced a smile to cross his features, cringing at how difficult it seemed to be to force one to the surface.</p><p>\u201cNo thank you, Mr. Stark.\u201d</p><p>Peter noticed the look of disappointment that crossed Tony\u2019s face, but rather decided to ignore it. He knew Tony hated him. He knew he was disappointed. Peter understood that it was a burden, that Tony having to give up his entire day just to spend time with one insignificant child was a terrible waste of time. He wasn\u2019t going to waste Tony\u2019s money, too. Not on something as stupid and childish as a pretzel.</p><p>\u201cWell, come on.\u201d Tony clasped a hand on Peter\u2019s shoulder and Peter almost toppled under the sudden weight. He had been feeling weak lately, but he had never noticed how weak he had actually <i>become</i>. \u201cYou wanted to see the park?\u201d</p><p>Peter looked up at him with a faltering smile and eyes that seemed to scream <i>help me</i>, before nodding weakly and taking his first step into the park.</p><p>Immediately after entering the shadows of the trees, Peter felt his whole demeanor lift.</p><p>The sounds of the city seemed to quiet as soon as Peter took that first step under the canopy of the trees, all that was left to be heard being the faint rustling of leaves and birds happily tweeting somewhere deeper within the park.</p><p>Peter found himself getting lost as the cool fall breeze caressed his face, the sunlight filtering through the thick canopies of trees blinding him with every second step. He felt Tony\u2019s presence beside him and he knew a conversation was coming, but for the moment he just tried to enjoy it - him and his mentor, him and his <i>dad</i>, enjoying the beautiful scene before them that was <i>nature</i>.</p><p>Peter always loved being out in nature. The fact that so much could grow - tree roots burrowing deep into the ground, flowers peeking through rocks in the earth, just reminded Peter that if nature could fight to live on, maybe he could, too.</p><p>Though, his plan wasn\u2019t going so well. Peter had hoped the walk through nature would remind him that he was strong, that he <i>could </i>do this, but all it seemed to be reminding him was that nature could succeed. <i>Nature </i>was strong enough to live on.</p><p>But Peter couldn\u2019t.</p><p>Peter paled in comparison.</p><p>Suddenly, the nature that had seemed so inspiring just a minute ago was taunting him now, just proving that Peter was weak. That Peter couldn\u2019t be strong, that he would never <i>amount </i>to anything. </p><p>If he even stayed alive that long to put in the work to.</p><p>Tony watched Peter\u2019s face change from calm, to anxious, to <i>distress </i>as his shoes lightly slapped on the path. He desperately wanted to reach out and start the conversation, but he had tried that. It hadn\u2019t worked.</p><p>Maybe he would try letting his kid come to <i>him</i>. After all, he knew how open Peter was about his feelings (or, used to be). He hoped Peter would come to him on his own time. And if he didn\u2019t, well, Tony would have no choice but to use his own methods, because he couldn\u2019t let Peter walk around with those <i>horrors </i>in his head any longer.</p><p>Just the thought of it made Tony want to cry. His kid had done that. His kid had thought he had no other choice but to <i>die</i>. And that was a fucking terrifying thought.</p><p>Tony would give Peter the day. This one day to let the kid talk to him. He wouldn\u2019t let Peter out of his sight, and by the end of it, if Peter still didn\u2019t want to communicate on his own terms, Tony would talk to him on his. Either way, Tony was ending this <i>today</i>.</p><p>They walked through the park quietly, Peter\u2019s eyes turning this way and that, and Tony tried to ignore how sad and <i>lost </i>they looked whenever they looked in Tony\u2019s direction. Tony, in turn, had his eyes trained solely on the kid. He had walked through the park before. He knew what it looked like. But even if he hadn\u2019t, if this had been his first time seeing it, Tony knew he would still only have eyes for the kid. Peter was the only thing that mattered.</p><p>Tony was glad it was a Wednesday, where kids were at school and adults at work. The two got to walk through the park mainly undisturbed, and Tony was eternally grateful, because he wasn\u2019t sure how the kid would fare with people everywhere. He knew that as much as Peter liked spending time with Tony and having that personal connection, strangers were a large cause of anxiety, and Tony wanted him as calm as possible.</p><p><i>Maybe I\u2019ll make my own Central Park</i>, Tony found himself thinking. <i>I\u2019ve got the money. I\u2019ll call is Central Parker</i>. Tony laughed at his own joke and immediately turned to repeat it out loud for Peter, but stopped when he almost ran into the kid.</p><p>Peter had stopped walking and was staring down at something in the pavement, bent down as he held out a hesitant hand. Tony slowly joined him on the ground, close enough to provide support, but not enough to be suffocating.</p><p>Peter\u2019s hand was held just inches away from a light lavender flower, a generic-looking one that every child drew in their pictures. <i>Cosmos</i>, Tony remembered from when his mother had taken him to this very same park when he was young, walking around with the wide-eyed boy, pointing out every unique piece of nature they came across.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a cosmos flower,\u201d he murmured quietly, his mother saying the exact same words to him forty years ago. It was amazing how clearly he could remember the words, the voice. They put a smile on his face as he continued with the speech. \u201cMeans beautiful and orderly in Greek.\u201d He paused a moment to let Peter reach out and gently caress the soft petals like Tony himself had done as a small child.</p><p>\u201cBut typically, it means \u2018love flower\u2019.\u201d</p><p>Slowly, Peter withdrew his hand from the petals, but continued to rest back on his heels and just stare at it, growing alone, isolated, but strongly amongst the gravel of the path. The park was quiet around them, seeming to hold its breath as it looked down upon the two, crouched around the flower. There was no one else in sight, but even if there was, Tony wouldn\u2019t have cared.</p><p>He didn\u2019t think about how it would look to see the great Tony Stark and a young boy kneeling in the middle of Central Park around a single flower. All that mattered to him was remembering the speech his mother had told him so many years ago, and finishing it for his own son.</p><p>Slowly, Tony reached out and gingerly twisted the stem of the flower until it pulled free from its roots. \u201c\u2018<i>Used to illustrate one\u2019s deepest feelings of love</i>,\u2019\u201d he repeated from the Google search he had done not too long ago.</p><p>That conversation with his mother had never left his mind, but during these last few years with Peter it had seemed to grow more and more important, and he had done some more research on those flowers, wondering if they had really represented everything Maria Stark had once told him.</p><p>They had. And so much more.</p><p>Tony slowly reached forwards to loop the stem into Peter\u2019s curls, knowing he wouldn\u2019t be opposed to the open display of affection.</p><p>So he was surprised when Peter jolted away, tears forming in his eyes.</p><p>Tony let the flower fall to the ground, forgotten, as he gently leaned forward to rest his hands on the kid\u2019s shoulders, eyes wide and eyebrows furrowing in confusion.</p><p>\u201cPete?\u201d he spoke softly as the kid looked up at him, looking\u2026 <i>hurt</i>?</p><p>\u201cYou killed it,\u201d he whispered, looking betrayed, and Tony looked back at him, horrified. <i>What had he killed? </i>Oh gosh, what had he <i>killed</i>?</p><p>\u201cThe flower,\u201d Peter continued quietly, and Tony\u2019s heart sunk in his chest. \u201cYou just\u2026 killed it.\u201d</p><p>Tony looked down at where it had been discarded on the floor. Peter was caring about\u2026 a <i>flower</i>? He knew Peter was sensitive. He didn\u2019t know the <i>flower </i>would upset him.</p><p>Until suddenly, it clicked into place.</p><p>Why Peter stopped to look at the flower in the first place.</p><p>\u201cPeter, what did you see in that flower?\u201d He let his hands fall into his lap as he let the kid collect himself, first looking down painfully at the flower, then up at Tony.</p><p>\u201cIt was strong,\u201d he whispered, almost to himself. Tony had to strain to hear him, his eyes softening at the raw <i>emotion </i>in Peter\u2019s voice.</p><p>\u201cIt was alone,\u201d he continued, looking back to where the flower lay, and suddenly the colours looked a lot less vibrant. \u201cBut it was <i>growing</i>. And it was <i>surviving</i>, and you - you-\u201d</p><p>A feeling of <i>betrayal </i>came over Peter. As soon as he saw that flower, he recognized <i>himself</i>. Alone, abandoned, in the middle of the path. The colours weren\u2019t exceptionally bright, but the flower was still shining, still <i>growing</i>, despite the dry terrain around it.</p><p>And Mr. Stark had came along, despite all the flower\u2019s efforts to fight and grow and <i>live</i>, he had just pulled it out of the ground. Let it <i>wilt </i>and <i>die</i>.</p><p>Suddenly, Peter\u2019s thinking did a complete 180\u00b0 turn.</p><p>Peter was crying.</p><p>Over a stinking <i>flower</i>.</p><p>What the heck was <i>wrong </i>with him?</p><p>Oh, geez, he had just accused Tony of killing - of killing a damn <i>flower</i>.</p><p><i>What the heck?</i></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Peter sighed, looking down, dejected, ashamed, as suddenly he wasn\u2019t feeling sad, he was just feeling\u2026 what was it, frustrated? With <i>himself</i>?</p><p>Why were feelings so<i> confusing</i>?</p><p>Geez, if Tony didn\u2019t hate him before, he <i>definitely </i>did now.</p><p>\u201cKid.\u201d Tony\u2019s voice pierced his thoughts, but Peter refused to look up. He just accused Tony of being a <i>murderer</i>. He was sure his face was flushed bright red.</p><p>Was it too late to run away?</p><p>Peter buried his face in his hands and pressed down, <i>hard</i>, wanting to just squish himself out of existence.</p><p>But that didn\u2019t work.</p><p>He ran his hands up into his hair, threaded them through, and <i>pulled</i>.</p><p>Stupid, stupid, <i>stupid</i>-</p><p>\u201cPeter, <i>geez</i>, kid-\u201d</p><p>Tony\u2019s hands wrapped around Peter\u2019s wrists and tried to pull them out, but Peter was holding fast. He didn\u2019t deserve Tony\u2019s sympathy, he didn\u2019t deserve <i>Tony</i>-</p><p>\u201cJust let me die.\u201d</p><p>Tony\u2019s hands froze, and Peter realized he had said that <i>out loud</i>.</p><p>Crap.</p><p>That wasn\u2019t a joke to be made in a situation like this, that wasn\u2019t appropriate-</p><p>But now Peter just wanted to die <i>more</i>.</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>Wait, since when did Peter <i>swear</i>?</p><p>\u201cOh, kid,\u201d Tony sighed, and Peter let his hands fall from his hair, too exhausted to keep pulling. He didn\u2019t even know <i>why </i>he was tired, but suddenly he was falling forwards, sobbing into Tony\u2019s arms - and Tony let him.</p><p>He caught the kid and held him to his chest, rested his chin over Peter\u2019s head, and let one hand thread through his curls while the other ran circles on his back.</p><p>He felt Peter\u2019s body shake with the weight of his sobs, Tony\u2019s shirt being soaked with tears, and his heart panged with sadness. He didn\u2019t know having a kid could hurt <i>this much</i>.</p><p>As he held his kid, sobbing, Tony knew this wasn\u2019t his fault. Not all of it, at least. He knew depression didn\u2019t pick its victims. It struck whoever was nearby, not caring who they were, what they had done.</p><p>If depression cared, if it was <i>fair</i>, Peter would be flying high as a kite right now while Tony, ever deserving, would be lying in a ditch.</p><p>But depression <i>didn\u2019t</i> care, and Peter, the kid, the <i>person</i>, who deserved this least in the world, was being forced to carry a burden he should\u2019ve never had to.</p><p>And Tony felt like this, like having to <i>cradle </i>his sobbing kid in his arms, was a hundred times worse than anything depression could throw at him directly.</p><p>Gently, Tony supported Peter\u2019s weight and guided him up to sit on a nearby park bench, sneaking the flower into his back pocket on the way. He set Peter on the bench beside him and let the kid lean into his shoulders, the sobs subsiding slightly, the occasional sniffle being the only sound between the two.</p><p>Tony\u2019s heart ached for the kid, and he wished he could take his pain away. Peter didn\u2019t deserve <i>any </i>of this, not one bit, and when he finally heard the sniffles subside to a few soft gasps, he decided now was the time to show the kid how much he cared.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened, Petey?\u201d he murmured, rubbing a comforting hand along Peter\u2019s arm, letting the kid lean into his side and rest his head against Tony\u2019s shoulder. Peter just turned his head and buried it into Tony\u2019s neck, and Tony\u2019s heart <i>melted </i>at the touch. He hated to put Peter through this, to force him to face his inner demons, but the sun always came after the storm. So he just needed to push through.</p><p>\u201cI know it sucks, Pete, I know,\u201d he muttered into his kid\u2019s matted curls, and Peter let out a shuddering breath. \u201cI just want to help you. Please, let me help you.\u201d</p><p>Peter burrowed his head deeper into Tony\u2019s shoulder, hoping Tony would shield him (from what, neither one knew), and Tony let him. He would protect his kid from anything, <i>everything</i>, he could. But it pained him to know, that this problem was one Tony couldn\u2019t protect him from.</p><p>But he would try.</p><p>Tony waited quietly, knowing Peter was just gathering the courage to speak. His hand found its way into Peter\u2019s curls, knowing how much Peter loved the touch, and he smiled when Peter let out a contented sigh.</p><p>At least he could do that much for his kid.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know where to start,\u201d he whispered, tears returning to his eyes - and that was the truth. Peter had no idea what he was thinking, what he was <i>feeling </i>- how was he supposed to express it to someone else? How was he supposed to tell someone who he looked up to greatly? His idol? His <i>dad</i>? How would Tony look at him when he finished?</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay, kid.\u201d Tony moved his fingers so he was massaging Peter\u2019s scalp, and he loved the way he leaned into Tony\u2019s touch. \u201cJust tell me whatever\u2019s on your mind right now. I promise you I won\u2019t think any less of you. I love you, kid, okay? No matter what.\u201d</p><p>Peter nodded slowly and took a deep breath. Whatever was on his mind.</p><p>But <i>what </i>was on his mind?</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he whispered, the entirety of his weight on Tony now, too exhausted to hold himself up. \u201cI don\u2019t know, I - I can\u2019t think, and I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m feeling, and I-\u201d</p><p>He collapsed into tears, but they were more quiet now, Peter being too mentally exhausted to make a noise.</p><p>\u201cPeter,\u201d Tony found himself whispering once again. \u201cBreathe, bimbo mio, breathe.\u201d</p><p>Tony rarely used that word. It was one his mother had used on him multiple times, <i>my child</i>, but he had never felt like the time had been right to use it on Peter - until now. Clearly, Peter had recognized the affection behind the words and took another shuddering breath.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m feeling,\u201d he tried again, squeezing his eyes shut, trying to focus - to gather his thoughts.</p><p>He hated that he couldn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cSometimes I get these thoughts, but I - I can\u2019t control them. Like, the flower?\u201d He took a breath. \u201cI don\u2019t know what came over me, I just - it reminded me of, of <i>me</i>, and then you pulled it out of the ground, and it wasn\u2019t your <i>fault </i>but I still got mad when I had no reason to be and I accused you of being a <i>murderer</i> and that was so <i>mean </i>and, please don\u2019t hate me, I\u2019m sorry - Mr. Stark, I am <i>so sorry</i>-\u201d</p><p>Peter was crying now, gasping for air, shuddering through his tears. He found himself subconsciously curling in closer to Tony, trying to find protection, comfort, in the man\u2019s arms.</p><p>Tony was telling him something, something about him being okay, him being <i>brave</i>, but Peter really didn\u2019t feel brave, not in the slightest. <i>I\u2019m weak</i>, he wanted to argue back, but he had no strength. His limbs felt like they were strapped to weights, useless at his sides. There was a cloud of darkness around his mind, squeezing, suffocating, and he just wanted it to be over, he just wanted it all to <i>end</i>-</p><p>And this was exactly what he found himself telling Tony.</p><p>\u201cLife is hard,\u201d he gasped out, cutting Tony off. Tony closed his mouth immediately, just content that his kid was actually talking again.</p><p>\u201cWell, I mean, it\u2019s not - it\u2019s not <i>hard</i>,\u201d he tried to explain, but he couldn\u2019t. He <i>couldn\u2019t</i>. And he hated it.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not hard, especially not for me, I have it pretty good. I mean, I have powers, I\u2019m <i>Spiderman</i>, and it\u2019s awesome, and I have you, Mr. Stark, and Ned, and MJ, but I don\u2019t know why it\u2019s so hard, and I know I seem so ungrateful, but I\u2019m not, I am so, <i>so </i>grateful for everything and all of you but my mind just <i>won\u2019t let me be</i>-\u201d</p><p>He took a minute to breathe, his eyes still squeezed shut tight, feeling Mr. Stark\u2019s shoulders rise and fall gently beneath him, letting the motion sooth him.</p><p>\u201cI want to be happy,\u201d he murmured, slower now - more in control. \u201cI want to be, and I really <i>should </i>be, but I\u2019m just <i>not</i>. I mean, some days I am. And some days I\u2019m really happy, but others I don\u2019t even want to get out of bed, and there\u2019s no reason for it, and sometimes we\u2019re working in the lab and I\u2019ll be fine but suddenly I\u2019ll drop a screw or something and I\u2019ll just fall apart, and I don\u2019t know what it is, Mr. Stark, but I promise you I\u2019m trying to be better, and I <i>will </i>be better, I swear, and I\u2019m sorry for all this, and I\u2019m sorry you have to <i>deal </i>with this, but it\u2019s not my choice I swear and I\u2019m trying to be good and I promise you I can be good-\u201d</p><p>Tony was taken aback by how much Peter was talking. Tears began to form in his eyes. He had guessed it was bad, for Peter to want to take such\u2026 <i>drastic </i>measures, but he had never known, had never even fathomed how <i>hard </i>it had actually been. All those times Peter had used the excuse of just being tired, when he would wake up late and slide his feet on the tile while walking, too tired to pick them up-</p><p>How many calls for help had Tony missed?</p><p>Scratch that statement from earlier. Tony was <i>definitely </i>to blame for Peter\u2019s state.</p><p>Peter lay curled into Tony\u2019s side. The cool air no longer provided refreshing comfort to him - it now just made him feel exposed, and Tony was now the only barrier between Peter and the dangers out there. So he held him close, tears streaming down his face, Peter\u2019s mind seeming to quiet.</p><p>Though, he found the quiet mind was worse than the loud one.</p><p>At least the loud mind was distracting. There was always something to think about, to try to process.</p><p>The quiet mind was\u2026 <i>quiet</i>. There was nothing to process. There was nothing to prevent the horrid thoughts that were constantly trying to fight their way in.</p><p>Like right now.</p><p>He might as well tell Tony, right? All or nothing. Tony probably hated him by now, anyways. There would be no (extra) harm in telling him more. And he wanted, <i>needed</i>, to get it off his chest, anyways.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s especially bad now,\u201d he spoke stronger, like it was a fact. \u201cI don\u2019t even know why, but sometimes my mind is quiet and other times it\u2019s loud, and right now it\u2019s quiet, so it\u2019s just me versus my thoughts, and my thoughts are winning.\u201d</p><p>Tony tensed beside his kid. Peter sounded\u2026 dull. Empty. Void of emotion. And when he was crying just a minute ago\u2026 what did that <i>mean</i>?</p><p>\u201cWhat are your thoughts saying?\u201d Tony asked, though he wasn\u2019t sure he wanted to know the answer.</p><p>Peter was terrified to tell him.</p><p>He had been keeping these thoughts a secret for so long, hiding the horrors of his mind, and he wondered if he would even be able to speak them out loud.</p><p>\u201cYou are so strong, bimbo mio.\u201d There was that word again.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re saying\u2026.\u201d Peter squeezed his eyes tighter. Last chance to act like he\u2019s fine. <i>My thoughts aren\u2019t saying anything at the moment! False alarm, all\u2019s good!</i></p><p>But this was Tony. Tony would see right through him.</p><p>And he <i>does </i>want to tell someone. More than anything, he <i>desperately </i>wants to tell someone, to actually cry out for help.</p><p>And who better than Mr. Stark?</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re telling me to-\u201d A shuddering breath. \u201cThey\u2019re telling me to leave the park, and to go on - onto the road, and, um, l-lie down-\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeter.\u201d Tony\u2019s voice was strong, demanding, and Peter flinched as Tony\u2019s arm tightened over his shoulder.</p><p>He turned his head to look back at Tony, and the fierceness he saw in the man\u2019s eyes made him want to shrink back in fear. He had seen this look before, directed at villains or at the press when they got too personal, but Peter never expected it would be directed at <i>him</i>.</p><p>\u201cYou <i>never </i>say anything like that <i>again</i>.\u201d Peter was quick to nod, the arm around his shoulders feeling more restricting than comforting now.</p><p>He had expected Tony to be disgusted with him. To leave him, because he wasn\u2019t willing to put in the work to help him heal. No one was.</p><p>He had never expected <i>anger</i>.</p><p>Anger directed at <i>him</i>.</p><p>Suddenly, Tony\u2019s eyes softened, and he pulled lightly on Peter\u2019s shoulders, letting the kid fall into his side. Peter did reluctantly, only because he knew how upset Tony was with him, and he didn\u2019t want want to risk making it any worse.</p><p>\u201cPeter.\u201d The boy was taken aback at the sudden softness in his voice. It sounded like Tony was\u2026 <i>crying</i>? \u201cYou promise me-\u201d A pause. A loud swallow. \u201cYou <i>promise </i>me that you will never, <i>ever</i> listen to that voice, okay?\u201d</p><p>Slowly, in a state of sluggish movement, Peter nodded his head, but Tony\u2019s grip just tightened.</p><p>\u201c<i>Promise </i>me.\u201d</p><p>Peter had never heard such passion in the man\u2019s voice, but he knew why Tony was asking for this specifically.</p><p>Peter never went back on his promises.</p><p>And Tony knew.</p><p>Tentatively, not knowing if a time would come when he would go back on that promise, Peter spoke up.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I promise.\u201d</p><p>Tony\u2019s arm went slack and he sighed deeply, Peter not being able to decide between relaxing in the grasp of his mentor, or tensing in memory of the fire he had heard in Tony\u2019s voice.</p><p>He decided on relaxing, knowing (hoping) that Tony only wanted to protect him, and now that Tony knew, now that he <i>understood</i>, he would be more gentle, more considerate.</p><p>Peter was wrong.</p>",
                "content": "<p><b><i>Warning: this story is based heavily around suicide, including suicidal thoughts and attempts. Please be careful!! &lt;3</i></b></p><hr /><p>Tony noticed Peter&rsquo;s eyes trained on the ground the entire way to the park - even as they passed all the buildings he used to love, all the people he used to smile at, the dogs he loved to meet, and, Tony noticed with a pang in his chest, the pretzel stand just outside the entrance Peter used to love to visit.</p><p>He watched as Peter trudged past it without a second glance, barely looking up as he took his first step into the park.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, Pete,&rdquo; Tony called, Peter looking up in vague confusion and surprise. Tony couldn&rsquo;t help but notice he looked&hellip; <i>lost</i>. Not mentally, but literally. Like he had forgotten how he had gotten there.</p><p>&ldquo;Pretzel?&rdquo;</p><p>Tony gestured his hand to the stand behind him, hoping to see some recognition in the kid&rsquo;s face.</p><p>He was sincerely disappointed.</p><p>Peter looked up at the pretzel stand after quickly scanning his surroundings.</p><p><i>How had he gotten to the park?</i></p><p>He was walking, and then&hellip;</p><p>How long ago did he leave the tower?</p><p>Wait, today was <i>Wednesday</i>! Why wasn&rsquo;t Peter at school?</p><p>Gosh, Tony would be <i>so mad </i>Peter was skipping.</p><p>Why was Peter skipping?</p><p>Wait, Tony had asked him a question.</p><p>Wait, Tony was <i>right in front </i>of him.</p><p><i>Oh</i>.</p><p>Central Park.</p><p>Peter&rsquo;s breakdown.</p><p>The memories came rushing back, causing Peter&rsquo;s vision to spin momentarily as a minor headache pierced his skull.</p><p>Okay, Tony&rsquo;s question. Something about a&hellip;</p><p><i>pretzel?</i></p><p>Hundreds of memories bubbled to the surface of Peter&rsquo;s mind when he noticed <i>Pablo&rsquo;s Pretzel Stand </i>printed on the small shack Tony was gesturing to, the yellow and blue sign seeming to call to him and beckon him closer. Peter&rsquo;s grade eight graduation, when he won his first Decathlon - so many happy memories were associated with this one place.</p><p>Which is why Peter expected to feel some kind of connection to it. A smile would come across his face before he could stop it and he would bound over, begging Tony to buy him a huge, salty pretzel as his heart filled with joy and happiness.</p><p>But it never came.</p><p>Peter <i>wanted</i> to feel happy.</p><p>He <i>wanted </i>to feel a sense of <i>connection </i>to this place.</p><p>He should be feeling <i>something</i>, right? I mean, this one pretzel stand held so many memories for him; it would be ludicrous for him to feel an empty, gaping hole in the middle of his chest, the once bright letters seeming dull, as he wondered how he felt such a lack of emotion in something that used to bring so much joy could be possible.</p><p>But that was exactly what he was feeling.</p><p>And it terrified him.</p><p>Peter forced a smile to cross his features, cringing at how difficult it seemed to be to force one to the surface.</p><p>&ldquo;No thank you, Mr. Stark.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter noticed the look of disappointment that crossed Tony&rsquo;s face, but rather decided to ignore it. He knew Tony hated him. He knew he was disappointed. Peter understood that it was a burden, that Tony having to give up his entire day just to spend time with one insignificant child was a terrible waste of time. He wasn&rsquo;t going to waste Tony&rsquo;s money, too. Not on something as stupid and childish as a pretzel.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, come on.&rdquo; Tony clasped a hand on Peter&rsquo;s shoulder and Peter almost toppled under the sudden weight. He had been feeling weak lately, but he had never noticed how weak he had actually <i>become</i>. &ldquo;You wanted to see the park?&rdquo;</p><p>Peter looked up at him with a faltering smile and eyes that seemed to scream <i>help me</i>, before nodding weakly and taking his first step into the park.</p><p>Immediately after entering the shadows of the trees, Peter felt his whole demeanor lift.</p><p>The sounds of the city seemed to quiet as soon as Peter took that first step under the canopy of the trees, all that was left to be heard being the faint rustling of leaves and birds happily tweeting somewhere deeper within the park.</p><p>Peter found himself getting lost as the cool fall breeze caressed his face, the sunlight filtering through the thick canopies of trees blinding him with every second step. He felt Tony&rsquo;s presence beside him and he knew a conversation was coming, but for the moment he just tried to enjoy it - him and his mentor, him and his <i>dad</i>, enjoying the beautiful scene before them that was <i>nature</i>.</p><p>Peter always loved being out in nature. The fact that so much could grow - tree roots burrowing deep into the ground, flowers peeking through rocks in the earth, just reminded Peter that if nature could fight to live on, maybe he could, too.</p><p>Though, his plan wasn&rsquo;t going so well. Peter had hoped the walk through nature would remind him that he was strong, that he <i>could </i>do this, but all it seemed to be reminding him was that nature could succeed. <i>Nature </i>was strong enough to live on.</p><p>But Peter couldn&rsquo;t.</p><p>Peter paled in comparison.</p><p>Suddenly, the nature that had seemed so inspiring just a minute ago was taunting him now, just proving that Peter was weak. That Peter couldn&rsquo;t be strong, that he would never <i>amount </i>to anything. </p><p>If he even stayed alive that long to put in the work to.</p><p>Tony watched Peter&rsquo;s face change from calm, to anxious, to <i>distress </i>as his shoes lightly slapped on the path. He desperately wanted to reach out and start the conversation, but he had tried that. It hadn&rsquo;t worked.</p><p>Maybe he would try letting his kid come to <i>him</i>. After all, he knew how open Peter was about his feelings (or, used to be). He hoped Peter would come to him on his own time. And if he didn&rsquo;t, well, Tony would have no choice but to use his own methods, because he couldn&rsquo;t let Peter walk around with those <i>horrors </i>in his head any longer.</p><p>Just the thought of it made Tony want to cry. His kid had done that. His kid had thought he had no other choice but to <i>die</i>. And that was a fucking terrifying thought.</p><p>Tony would give Peter the day. This one day to let the kid talk to him. He wouldn&rsquo;t let Peter out of his sight, and by the end of it, if Peter still didn&rsquo;t want to communicate on his own terms, Tony would talk to him on his. Either way, Tony was ending this <i>today</i>.</p><p>They walked through the park quietly, Peter&rsquo;s eyes turning this way and that, and Tony tried to ignore how sad and <i>lost </i>they looked whenever they looked in Tony&rsquo;s direction. Tony, in turn, had his eyes trained solely on the kid. He had walked through the park before. He knew what it looked like. But even if he hadn&rsquo;t, if this had been his first time seeing it, Tony knew he would still only have eyes for the kid. Peter was the only thing that mattered.</p><p>Tony was glad it was a Wednesday, where kids were at school and adults at work. The two got to walk through the park mainly undisturbed, and Tony was eternally grateful, because he wasn&rsquo;t sure how the kid would fare with people everywhere. He knew that as much as Peter liked spending time with Tony and having that personal connection, strangers were a large cause of anxiety, and Tony wanted him as calm as possible.</p><p><i>Maybe I&rsquo;ll make my own Central Park</i>, Tony found himself thinking. <i>I&rsquo;ve got the money. I&rsquo;ll call is Central Parker</i>. Tony laughed at his own joke and immediately turned to repeat it out loud for Peter, but stopped when he almost ran into the kid.</p><p>Peter had stopped walking and was staring down at something in the pavement, bent down as he held out a hesitant hand. Tony slowly joined him on the ground, close enough to provide support, but not enough to be suffocating.</p><p>Peter&rsquo;s hand was held just inches away from a light lavender flower, a generic-looking one that every child drew in their pictures. <i>Cosmos</i>, Tony remembered from when his mother had taken him to this very same park when he was young, walking around with the wide-eyed boy, pointing out every unique piece of nature they came across.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a cosmos flower,&rdquo; he murmured quietly, his mother saying the exact same words to him forty years ago. It was amazing how clearly he could remember the words, the voice. They put a smile on his face as he continued with the speech. &ldquo;Means beautiful and orderly in Greek.&rdquo; He paused a moment to let Peter reach out and gently caress the soft petals like Tony himself had done as a small child.</p><p>&ldquo;But typically, it means &lsquo;love flower&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p><p>Slowly, Peter withdrew his hand from the petals, but continued to rest back on his heels and just stare at it, growing alone, isolated, but strongly amongst the gravel of the path. The park was quiet around them, seeming to hold its breath as it looked down upon the two, crouched around the flower. There was no one else in sight, but even if there was, Tony wouldn&rsquo;t have cared.</p><p>He didn&rsquo;t think about how it would look to see the great Tony Stark and a young boy kneeling in the middle of Central Park around a single flower. All that mattered to him was remembering the speech his mother had told him so many years ago, and finishing it for his own son.</p><p>Slowly, Tony reached out and gingerly twisted the stem of the flower until it pulled free from its roots. &ldquo;&lsquo;<i>Used to illustrate one&rsquo;s deepest feelings of love</i>,&rsquo;&rdquo; he repeated from the Google search he had done not too long ago.</p><p>That conversation with his mother had never left his mind, but during these last few years with Peter it had seemed to grow more and more important, and he had done some more research on those flowers, wondering if they had really represented everything Maria Stark had once told him.</p><p>They had. And so much more.</p><p>Tony slowly reached forwards to loop the stem into Peter&rsquo;s curls, knowing he wouldn&rsquo;t be opposed to the open display of affection.</p><p>So he was surprised when Peter jolted away, tears forming in his eyes.</p><p>Tony let the flower fall to the ground, forgotten, as he gently leaned forward to rest his hands on the kid&rsquo;s shoulders, eyes wide and eyebrows furrowing in confusion.</p><p>&ldquo;Pete?&rdquo; he spoke softly as the kid looked up at him, looking&hellip; <i>hurt</i>?</p><p>&ldquo;You killed it,&rdquo; he whispered, looking betrayed, and Tony looked back at him, horrified. <i>What had he killed? </i>Oh gosh, what had he <i>killed</i>?</p><p>&ldquo;The flower,&rdquo; Peter continued quietly, and Tony&rsquo;s heart sunk in his chest. &ldquo;You just&hellip; killed it.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony looked down at where it had been discarded on the floor. Peter was caring about&hellip; a <i>flower</i>? He knew Peter was sensitive. He didn&rsquo;t know the <i>flower </i>would upset him.</p><p>Until suddenly, it clicked into place.</p><p>Why Peter stopped to look at the flower in the first place.</p><p>&ldquo;Peter, what did you see in that flower?&rdquo; He let his hands fall into his lap as he let the kid collect himself, first looking down painfully at the flower, then up at Tony.</p><p>&ldquo;It was strong,&rdquo; he whispered, almost to himself. Tony had to strain to hear him, his eyes softening at the raw <i>emotion </i>in Peter&rsquo;s voice.</p><p>&ldquo;It was alone,&rdquo; he continued, looking back to where the flower lay, and suddenly the colours looked a lot less vibrant. &ldquo;But it was <i>growing</i>. And it was <i>surviving</i>, and you - you-&rdquo;</p><p>A feeling of <i>betrayal </i>came over Peter. As soon as he saw that flower, he recognized <i>himself</i>. Alone, abandoned, in the middle of the path. The colours weren&rsquo;t exceptionally bright, but the flower was still shining, still <i>growing</i>, despite the dry terrain around it.</p><p>And Mr. Stark had came along, despite all the flower&rsquo;s efforts to fight and grow and <i>live</i>, he had just pulled it out of the ground. Let it <i>wilt </i>and <i>die</i>.</p><p>Suddenly, Peter&rsquo;s thinking did a complete 180&deg; turn.</p><p>Peter was crying.</p><p>Over a stinking <i>flower</i>.</p><p>What the heck was <i>wrong </i>with him?</p><p>Oh, geez, he had just accused Tony of killing - of killing a damn <i>flower</i>.</p><p><i>What the heck?</i></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; Peter sighed, looking down, dejected, ashamed, as suddenly he wasn&rsquo;t feeling sad, he was just feeling&hellip; what was it, frustrated? With <i>himself</i>?</p><p>Why were feelings so<i> confusing</i>?</p><p>Geez, if Tony didn&rsquo;t hate him before, he <i>definitely </i>did now.</p><p>&ldquo;Kid.&rdquo; Tony&rsquo;s voice pierced his thoughts, but Peter refused to look up. He just accused Tony of being a <i>murderer</i>. He was sure his face was flushed bright red.</p><p>Was it too late to run away?</p><p>Peter buried his face in his hands and pressed down, <i>hard</i>, wanting to just squish himself out of existence.</p><p>But that didn&rsquo;t work.</p><p>He ran his hands up into his hair, threaded them through, and <i>pulled</i>.</p><p>Stupid, stupid, <i>stupid</i>-</p><p>&ldquo;Peter, <i>geez</i>, kid-&rdquo;</p><p>Tony&rsquo;s hands wrapped around Peter&rsquo;s wrists and tried to pull them out, but Peter was holding fast. He didn&rsquo;t deserve Tony&rsquo;s sympathy, he didn&rsquo;t deserve <i>Tony</i>-</p><p>&ldquo;Just let me die.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony&rsquo;s hands froze, and Peter realized he had said that <i>out loud</i>.</p><p>Crap.</p><p>That wasn&rsquo;t a joke to be made in a situation like this, that wasn&rsquo;t appropriate-</p><p>But now Peter just wanted to die <i>more</i>.</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>Wait, since when did Peter <i>swear</i>?</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, kid,&rdquo; Tony sighed, and Peter let his hands fall from his hair, too exhausted to keep pulling. He didn&rsquo;t even know <i>why </i>he was tired, but suddenly he was falling forwards, sobbing into Tony&rsquo;s arms - and Tony let him.</p><p>He caught the kid and held him to his chest, rested his chin over Peter&rsquo;s head, and let one hand thread through his curls while the other ran circles on his back.</p><p>He felt Peter&rsquo;s body shake with the weight of his sobs, Tony&rsquo;s shirt being soaked with tears, and his heart panged with sadness. He didn&rsquo;t know having a kid could hurt <i>this much</i>.</p><p>As he held his kid, sobbing, Tony knew this wasn&rsquo;t his fault. Not all of it, at least. He knew depression didn&rsquo;t pick its victims. It struck whoever was nearby, not caring who they were, what they had done.</p><p>If depression cared, if it was <i>fair</i>, Peter would be flying high as a kite right now while Tony, ever deserving, would be lying in a ditch.</p><p>But depression <i>didn&rsquo;t</i> care, and Peter, the kid, the <i>person</i>, who deserved this least in the world, was being forced to carry a burden he should&rsquo;ve never had to.</p><p>And Tony felt like this, like having to <i>cradle </i>his sobbing kid in his arms, was a hundred times worse than anything depression could throw at him directly.</p><p>Gently, Tony supported Peter&rsquo;s weight and guided him up to sit on a nearby park bench, sneaking the flower into his back pocket on the way. He set Peter on the bench beside him and let the kid lean into his shoulders, the sobs subsiding slightly, the occasional sniffle being the only sound between the two.</p><p>Tony&rsquo;s heart ached for the kid, and he wished he could take his pain away. Peter didn&rsquo;t deserve <i>any </i>of this, not one bit, and when he finally heard the sniffles subside to a few soft gasps, he decided now was the time to show the kid how much he cared.</p><p>&ldquo;What happened, Petey?&rdquo; he murmured, rubbing a comforting hand along Peter&rsquo;s arm, letting the kid lean into his side and rest his head against Tony&rsquo;s shoulder. Peter just turned his head and buried it into Tony&rsquo;s neck, and Tony&rsquo;s heart <i>melted </i>at the touch. He hated to put Peter through this, to force him to face his inner demons, but the sun always came after the storm. So he just needed to push through.</p><p>&ldquo;I know it sucks, Pete, I know,&rdquo; he muttered into his kid&rsquo;s matted curls, and Peter let out a shuddering breath. &ldquo;I just want to help you. Please, let me help you.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter burrowed his head deeper into Tony&rsquo;s shoulder, hoping Tony would shield him (from what, neither one knew), and Tony let him. He would protect his kid from anything, <i>everything</i>, he could. But it pained him to know, that this problem was one Tony couldn&rsquo;t protect him from.</p><p>But he would try.</p><p>Tony waited quietly, knowing Peter was just gathering the courage to speak. His hand found its way into Peter&rsquo;s curls, knowing how much Peter loved the touch, and he smiled when Peter let out a contented sigh.</p><p>At least he could do that much for his kid.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know where to start,&rdquo; he whispered, tears returning to his eyes - and that was the truth. Peter had no idea what he was thinking, what he was <i>feeling </i>- how was he supposed to express it to someone else? How was he supposed to tell someone who he looked up to greatly? His idol? His <i>dad</i>? How would Tony look at him when he finished?</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s okay, kid.&rdquo; Tony moved his fingers so he was massaging Peter&rsquo;s scalp, and he loved the way he leaned into Tony&rsquo;s touch. &ldquo;Just tell me whatever&rsquo;s on your mind right now. I promise you I won&rsquo;t think any less of you. I love you, kid, okay? No matter what.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter nodded slowly and took a deep breath. Whatever was on his mind.</p><p>But <i>what </i>was on his mind?</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he whispered, the entirety of his weight on Tony now, too exhausted to hold himself up. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, I - I can&rsquo;t think, and I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;m feeling, and I-&rdquo;</p><p>He collapsed into tears, but they were more quiet now, Peter being too mentally exhausted to make a noise.</p><p>&ldquo;Peter,&rdquo; Tony found himself whispering once again. &ldquo;Breathe, bimbo mio, breathe.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony rarely used that word. It was one his mother had used on him multiple times, <i>my child</i>, but he had never felt like the time had been right to use it on Peter - until now. Clearly, Peter had recognized the affection behind the words and took another shuddering breath.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;m feeling,&rdquo; he tried again, squeezing his eyes shut, trying to focus - to gather his thoughts.</p><p>He hated that he couldn&rsquo;t.</p><p>&ldquo;Sometimes I get these thoughts, but I - I can&rsquo;t control them. Like, the flower?&rdquo; He took a breath. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what came over me, I just - it reminded me of, of <i>me</i>, and then you pulled it out of the ground, and it wasn&rsquo;t your <i>fault </i>but I still got mad when I had no reason to be and I accused you of being a <i>murderer</i> and that was so <i>mean </i>and, please don&rsquo;t hate me, I&rsquo;m sorry - Mr. Stark, I am <i>so sorry</i>-&rdquo;</p><p>Peter was crying now, gasping for air, shuddering through his tears. He found himself subconsciously curling in closer to Tony, trying to find protection, comfort, in the man&rsquo;s arms.</p><p>Tony was telling him something, something about him being okay, him being <i>brave</i>, but Peter really didn&rsquo;t feel brave, not in the slightest. <i>I&rsquo;m weak</i>, he wanted to argue back, but he had no strength. His limbs felt like they were strapped to weights, useless at his sides. There was a cloud of darkness around his mind, squeezing, suffocating, and he just wanted it to be over, he just wanted it all to <i>end</i>-</p><p>And this was exactly what he found himself telling Tony.</p><p>&ldquo;Life is hard,&rdquo; he gasped out, cutting Tony off. Tony closed his mouth immediately, just content that his kid was actually talking again.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I mean, it&rsquo;s not - it&rsquo;s not <i>hard</i>,&rdquo; he tried to explain, but he couldn&rsquo;t. He <i>couldn&rsquo;t</i>. And he hated it.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not hard, especially not for me, I have it pretty good. I mean, I have powers, I&rsquo;m <i>Spiderman</i>, and it&rsquo;s awesome, and I have you, Mr. Stark, and Ned, and MJ, but I don&rsquo;t know why it&rsquo;s so hard, and I know I seem so ungrateful, but I&rsquo;m not, I am so, <i>so </i>grateful for everything and all of you but my mind just <i>won&rsquo;t let me be</i>-&rdquo;</p><p>He took a minute to breathe, his eyes still squeezed shut tight, feeling Mr. Stark&rsquo;s shoulders rise and fall gently beneath him, letting the motion sooth him.</p><p>&ldquo;I want to be happy,&rdquo; he murmured, slower now - more in control. &ldquo;I want to be, and I really <i>should </i>be, but I&rsquo;m just <i>not</i>. I mean, some days I am. And some days I&rsquo;m really happy, but others I don&rsquo;t even want to get out of bed, and there&rsquo;s no reason for it, and sometimes we&rsquo;re working in the lab and I&rsquo;ll be fine but suddenly I&rsquo;ll drop a screw or something and I&rsquo;ll just fall apart, and I don&rsquo;t know what it is, Mr. Stark, but I promise you I&rsquo;m trying to be better, and I <i>will </i>be better, I swear, and I&rsquo;m sorry for all this, and I&rsquo;m sorry you have to <i>deal </i>with this, but it&rsquo;s not my choice I swear and I&rsquo;m trying to be good and I promise you I can be good-&rdquo;</p><p>Tony was taken aback by how much Peter was talking. Tears began to form in his eyes. He had guessed it was bad, for Peter to want to take such&hellip; <i>drastic </i>measures, but he had never known, had never even fathomed how <i>hard </i>it had actually been. All those times Peter had used the excuse of just being tired, when he would wake up late and slide his feet on the tile while walking, too tired to pick them up-</p><p>How many calls for help had Tony missed?</p><p>Scratch that statement from earlier. Tony was <i>definitely </i>to blame for Peter&rsquo;s state.</p><p>Peter lay curled into Tony&rsquo;s side. The cool air no longer provided refreshing comfort to him - it now just made him feel exposed, and Tony was now the only barrier between Peter and the dangers out there. So he held him close, tears streaming down his face, Peter&rsquo;s mind seeming to quiet.</p><p>Though, he found the quiet mind was worse than the loud one.</p><p>At least the loud mind was distracting. There was always something to think about, to try to process.</p><p>The quiet mind was&hellip; <i>quiet</i>. There was nothing to process. There was nothing to prevent the horrid thoughts that were constantly trying to fight their way in.</p><p>Like right now.</p><p>He might as well tell Tony, right? All or nothing. Tony probably hated him by now, anyways. There would be no (extra) harm in telling him more. And he wanted, <i>needed</i>, to get it off his chest, anyways.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s especially bad now,&rdquo; he spoke stronger, like it was a fact. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t even know why, but sometimes my mind is quiet and other times it&rsquo;s loud, and right now it&rsquo;s quiet, so it&rsquo;s just me versus my thoughts, and my thoughts are winning.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony tensed beside his kid. Peter sounded&hellip; dull. Empty. Void of emotion. And when he was crying just a minute ago&hellip; what did that <i>mean</i>?</p><p>&ldquo;What are your thoughts saying?&rdquo; Tony asked, though he wasn&rsquo;t sure he wanted to know the answer.</p><p>Peter was terrified to tell him.</p><p>He had been keeping these thoughts a secret for so long, hiding the horrors of his mind, and he wondered if he would even be able to speak them out loud.</p><p>&ldquo;You are so strong, bimbo mio.&rdquo; There was that word again.</p><p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re saying&hellip;.&rdquo; Peter squeezed his eyes tighter. Last chance to act like he&rsquo;s fine. <i>My thoughts aren&rsquo;t saying anything at the moment! False alarm, all&rsquo;s good!</i></p><p>But this was Tony. Tony would see right through him.</p><p>And he <i>does </i>want to tell someone. More than anything, he <i>desperately </i>wants to tell someone, to actually cry out for help.</p><p>And who better than Mr. Stark?</p><p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re telling me to-&rdquo; A shuddering breath. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re telling me to leave the park, and to go on - onto the road, and, um, l-lie down-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Peter.&rdquo; Tony&rsquo;s voice was strong, demanding, and Peter flinched as Tony&rsquo;s arm tightened over his shoulder.</p><p>He turned his head to look back at Tony, and the fierceness he saw in the man&rsquo;s eyes made him want to shrink back in fear. He had seen this look before, directed at villains or at the press when they got too personal, but Peter never expected it would be directed at <i>him</i>.</p><p>&ldquo;You <i>never </i>say anything like that <i>again</i>.&rdquo; Peter was quick to nod, the arm around his shoulders feeling more restricting than comforting now.</p><p>He had expected Tony to be disgusted with him. To leave him, because he wasn&rsquo;t willing to put in the work to help him heal. No one was.</p><p>He had never expected <i>anger</i>.</p><p>Anger directed at <i>him</i>.</p><p>Suddenly, Tony&rsquo;s eyes softened, and he pulled lightly on Peter&rsquo;s shoulders, letting the kid fall into his side. Peter did reluctantly, only because he knew how upset Tony was with him, and he didn&rsquo;t want want to risk making it any worse.</p><p>&ldquo;Peter.&rdquo; The boy was taken aback at the sudden softness in his voice. It sounded like Tony was&hellip; <i>crying</i>? &ldquo;You promise me-&rdquo; A pause. A loud swallow. &ldquo;You <i>promise </i>me that you will never, <i>ever</i> listen to that voice, okay?&rdquo;</p><p>Slowly, in a state of sluggish movement, Peter nodded his head, but Tony&rsquo;s grip just tightened.</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Promise </i>me.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter had never heard such passion in the man&rsquo;s voice, but he knew why Tony was asking for this specifically.</p><p>Peter never went back on his promises.</p><p>And Tony knew.</p><p>Tentatively, not knowing if a time would come when he would go back on that promise, Peter spoke up.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, I promise.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony&rsquo;s arm went slack and he sighed deeply, Peter not being able to decide between relaxing in the grasp of his mentor, or tensing in memory of the fire he had heard in Tony&rsquo;s voice.</p><p>He decided on relaxing, knowing (hoping) that Tony only wanted to protect him, and now that Tony knew, now that he <i>understood</i>, he would be more gentle, more considerate.</p><p>Peter was wrong.</p>",

Please be careful!! &lt;3</i></b></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Tony noticed Peter&rsquo;s eyes trained on the ground the entire way to the park - even as they passed all the buildings he used to love, all the people he used to smile at, the dogs he loved to meet, and, Tony noticed with a pang in his chest, the pretzel stand just outside the entrance Peter used to love to visit.</p>\n<p>He watched as Peter trudged past it without a second glance, barely looking up as he took his first step into the park.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Hey, Pete,&rdquo; Tony called, Peter looking up in vague confusion and surprise.
