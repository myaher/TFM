(inspired by <a href=\"https://theobligatedklutz.tumblr.com/post/183642133426/cyrus-sits-down-one-day-to-write-down-all-the\">this post)</a></p><p><b>ship: </b>tyrus</p><p><b>word count:</b> 9235 (she\u2019s a hefty one)</p><p><b>notes:</b> happy late birthday amanda! <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mqsacC6O0CwDxqCVXhKqKMg\">@swingsetboys</a> i hope you like this!<b><br/><br/></b><i>1. I\u2019m annoying</i></p><p>That one was a given, Cyrus thought. He always asked one too many questions, laughed a little too loud, and complained a little too often for people\u2019s likings. It only made sense that this was probably one of the main reasons that TJ probably hates him.</p><p>Hate. He doesn\u2019t like that word; it\u2019s so strong, it has so much power. Yet, it almost seems to fit the mood. After all, the costume was TJ\u2019s idea, not his. TJ was the one who looked so excited to do the costume based on an inside joke. And yet, TJ was the one who bailed on it. TJ was the one who did a costume with a girl he, supposedly, barely even knew.</p><p>He sighed, putting down his pen and leaning back in his chair. Maybe this didn&rsquo;t just start right around costume day. Maybe it went further back, but how far back? A week? A month? Cyrus shook his head, breathing out forcefully. Might as well start from the very beginning, he thought to himself.</p><!-- more --><p>The whole thing started with that damn muffin. The muffin, he pointedly thought, that he couldn\u2019t get for himself because he was too much of a coward to cut in line and get it for himself.</p><p><i>2. I\u2019m weak</i></p><p><i>3. I\u2019m helpless</i><br/><br/><i>Just like Jonah said</i>, he thought, but left that unwritten. He already knew that; he didn\u2019t want it written down.<br/><br/>That day with the stupid muffin seemed almost like a far away dream to him. He was almost certain that TJ&hellip;smiled at him? It was kind of fuzzy; if you\u2019d asked him a week ago, he\u2019d be able to tell you how many steps TJ took towards him before saying \u2018he\u2019s with me\u2019. But now, he doubted that the whole exchange even happened. All he remembered was that he looked at TJ like this monster, like someone who could and would crush him underneath his sneaker. But&hellip;he didn\u2019t. He was surprisingly friendly.<br/></p><p><i>4. I jump to conclusions</i></p><p><i>5. I get scared too easily</i></p><p><i>6. I\u2019m a bad judge of character</i></p><p>For days after that, Cyrus had found himself lingering over their interaction, if you could even call it that. He\u2019d absentmindedly draw a muffin on his biology notes. At lunch, he\u2019d stare at his mashed potatoes so long that Buffy had to physically prod him to make him eat. And when his parents drove him home from school, the car ride was remarkably quiet.</p><p>He really thought that that would have been the first and last time that him and TJ interacted. He was <i>fairly </i>certain that was the taller boy\u2019s name; Buffy had mentioned her disgust for him several times before. But their conversation had only just begun.</p><p>A little while later, Cyrus had found himself drenched in sweat from head to toe because oh his goodness, he couldn\u2019t stop himself from getting tongue-tied in front of the camera. And it certainly didn\u2019t help that he was with his, now-ex, crush. That only made him want to do well <i>more</i>, which of course led to a disastrous outcome. He\u2019d ended up running towards the swings to try and calm down. He\u2019d even sung that stupid song he made up in elementary school.</p><p>And then, seemingly out of nowhere, TJ popped behind him, with a compliment for his song. And Cyrus&hellip;well, Cyrus just looked scared. He probably looked like a deer in the headlights from TJ\u2019s perspective. And then of course, TJ had made some joke about what he sang on the slide. Probably in a pitiful attempt to make conversation</p><p><i>7. I\u2019m pitiful</i></p><p>Somehow he\u2019d managed to convince TJ to sit and swing with him. <i>With him</i>. It felt almost natural, them sitting together on the swings. Well, not together per se, but they were on the same swing set. Separately.</p><p><i>\u2018You don\u2019t know me. I got stuff.\u2019</i></p><p>He\u2019d never forgotten those words, because in that moment, he felt almost comfortable around TJ. Like he just wanted to spill everything and get everything off his chest.</p><p><i>8. I get too comfortable with people I barely know</i></p><p>They\u2019d barely even talked that day. All that Cyrus had learned was that, apparently, TJ had things that he needed to feel better about, which to Cyrus, sounded absolutely absurd. He was the captain of the basketball team, people were borderline terrified of him, and let\u2019s be honest, he wasn\u2019t ugly. Far from it, actually, save for the insane amount of hair gel he used to wear.</p><p>And when he gave him an underdog, he barely remembered feeling so light and so effortless all at once. It felt like he was on top of the world, and that nothing could touch him. And the smile on TJ\u2019s face when he was squealing like mad&hellip;it was nice to see. Even then, Cyrus could tell he didn\u2019t smile like that, or maybe even at all, much.</p><p><i>9. I\u2019m scared of stupid things</i></p><p>And then Buffy had shown up and TJ instantly put up his walls again and wanted to hurry off. And for some weird reason, Cyrus didn\u2019t want him to leave. He wanted his new&hellip;friend? (if he could call him that) to make sure that he knew that Buffy was cool, and understanding when she wanted to be.</p><p><i>10. I want things that I can\u2019t have</i></p><p><i>\u2018Thanks for reminding me about swinging. That helped.\u2019</i></p><p>For once that day, he felt useful, like he\u2019d been successful in making someone just a little bit happier. He\u2019d gone home that day feeling pretty good about himself. Even his parents seemed to notice his good mood, but when they asked him about it, he just shrugged it off, saying that he\u2019d found a few dollars on his way in to school. He was fairly certain they didn\u2019t believe him, but they didn\u2019t pry anymore, simply letting them eat his dinner in peace.</p><p><i>11. I get happy at dumb things</i></p><p>A few days after their encounter at the swings, TJ somehow managed to find Cyrus again in the hallway. He looked oddly stressed, and he didn\u2019t have the same easygoing \u2018shrug it off\u2019 demeanor that he\u2019d sported just a few days ago. He looked like he wanted to say something, Cyrus could tell by the way he\u2019d carried himself. He hadn\u2019t forgotten their conversation from that day.</p><p><i>\u201cSomething on your mind?\u201d Cyrus had asked, rocking back on his heels.</i></p><p><i>TJ had just shrugged, tugging on his hoodie straps. \u201cJust&hellip;stuff,\u201d he\u2019d said lamely, but Cyrus could see behind his indifferent demeanor.</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to tell me now, or ever,\u201d Cyrus had assured him, and was ready to walk off when TJ started pulling something out of his back pocket.</i></p><p><i>\u201cHere,\u201d he mumbled, handing Cyrus his phone, \u201cput your number in and I\u2019ll&hellip;tell you about it sometime, I guess,\u201d</i></p><p><i>Cyrus had nearly dropped the boy\u2019s phone from pure shock. TJ was asking for his number? Well, no. More like TJ didn\u2019t want to talk right now and instead wanted a second method of communication.</i></p><p><i>\u201cO-Okay,\u201d Cyrus had stammered out, putting his phone number in, all the while thinking about what he would write for his contact name. He wanted to make it something a little creative, but not something so stupid that it was embarrassing.</i></p><p><i>\u2018Cyrus (Underdog)\u2019 he typed out, before handing it back to TJ. He had glanced down at his phone, and Cyrus had sworn he saw the ghost of a smile.</i></p><p><i>\u201cCool, I\u2019ll text you,\u201d he\u2019d said, before running up to catch up with his basketball friends.</i></p><p><i>He\u2019d waited all weekend for TJ to text him, but he never had. He\u2019d even sent him a text himself.</i></p><p><i>[Cyrus: hey it\u2019s cyrus! but you probably know that, anyways i\u2019m here to listen if you ever want to talk :)]</i></p><p><i>He regretted it the moment he\u2019d sent it.</i></p><p><i>12. I\u2019m a dork</i></p><p><i>13. I\u2019m clingy</i></p><p>When it had come time to invite people to his bar mitzvah, the last invitation was almost shaking in his hand. Why he was so nervous to hand it to TJ was beyond him, but looking back, a crush was definitely forming. Hindsight truly was a savior. He really, <i>really </i>wanted TJ to come, so much that he probably sounded desperate when he asked.</p><p><i>14. I\u2019m desperate</i></p><p><i>15. I\u2019m a geek</i></p><p>Luckily for him, TJ had accepted; heck, he\u2019d even smiled at him. And then, he launched into a conversation about Buffy. Something about needing her to do something for him. And there it was, he thought, the reason that TJ had even talked to him at all. He need a favor. What? A date? Her number? TJ had ended up being pretty vague about the whole ordeal.</p><p><i>\u201cJust use her two favorite words,\u201d Cyrus had said confidently.</i></p><p><i>\u201cI\u2019m sorry?\u201d</i></p><p><i>He\u2019d paled, eyes bugging out of his head. \u201cNo, she hates those words,\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cThen what?\u201d</i></p><p><i>Cyrus had hesitated. On the one hand, he did want to keep talking to TJ. On the other hand, he didn\u2019t want to say something he shouldn\u2019t. But one look up to him, seeing him almost smiling, he nodding up the sidewalk.</i></p><p><i>\u201cCome with me. You might not like saying this, but Buffy will love hearing it.\u201d The two of them had walked out towards the bus stop at the front of the school. After checking to see if the coast was clear, no Buffy in sight, Cyrus had stepped in front of TJ.</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d he\u2019d said.</i></p><p><i>TJ furrowed his brows in confusion. \u201cAbout what?\u201d</i></p><p><i>Cyrus shook his head. \u201cNo, those are her favorite words. \u2018You\u2019re right\u2019. I don\u2019t know what it is about them, but she just&hellip;seems to cave at whatever when you say them. It\u2019s how I got her to sell me Tokyo,\u201d</i></p><p><i>TJ looked at him, even more confused than before, but there was an air of fondness in his gaze.</i></p><p><i>Cyrus waved him off. \u201cMonopoly. Long story.\u201d</i></p><p><i>TJ nodded curtly, upon hearing the bus beep. \u201cMaybe you could tell me sometime,\u201d he offered, shaking his phone, \u201cyou can use emojis and everything,\u201d he\u2019d joked, before waving and heading onto the bus.</i></p><p><i>Cyrus couldn\u2019t wipe that stupid smile off of his face no matter how hard he tried.</i></p><p><i>Sure enough, when he got home that night, he sent TJ a long text explaining how he just needed Tokyo to complete his collection, but Buffy wouldn\u2019t sell it to him. He didn\u2019t really remember what had happened, other than the fact that he\u2019d said \u2018you\u2019re right\u2019 so many times it started to sound like a foreign language.</i></p><p><i>And this time, TJ did send him a text back</i></p><p><i>[TJ \ud83c\udfc0: lol that\u2019s funny. i\u2019ll remember that. thanks for today]</i></p><p>Cyrus almost smiled as he added new things to the list. Memories of his bar mitzvah were fond, and he wishes times could be as simple as they were back then. He hadn\u2019t seen TJ that much, save for the time that he couldn\u2019t open a damn bottle.</p><p><i>\u201cHey, Underdog!\u201d TJ had said above the music, approaching him.</i></p><p><i>Cyrus had just groaned in response, his shoulders slumping, He set the bottle back down on the table and swiped at his hairline. \u201cHey, TJ,\u201d</i></p><p><i>TJ had looked between Cyrus and the bottle. \u201cNeed some help?\u201d</i></p><p><i>Cyrus shook his head. \u201cNo, I\u2019m supposed to do this myself, you know. Be a man and all that jazz,\u201d he chuckles, cringing inwardly.</i></p><p><i>16. I\u2019m cringy</i></p><p><i>17. I have no physical strength</i></p><p><i>TJ nodded, putting his hands in his pocket, before he\u2019d stepped forward and grabbed the bottle. Cyrus had started to panic a little, but TJ assured him things would be fine. He\u2019d started to open the bottle, just a little, and then had quickly handed it over to Cyrus to finish it off.</i></p><p><i>\u201cAll yours, dude,\u201d he whispered, discreetly shuffling back towards the dance floor. Cyrus had stood stunned for a few moments, before he came to his senses and opened the bottle the rest of the way. It made a satisfying \u2018pop!\u2019 and the foam spilled over the neck. All of his family and friends were clapping, and if he squinted, he could see TJ, clapping his hands and smiling.</i></p><p>Things seemed near perfect that day. He hadn\u2019t seen TJ for the rest of the party, but he assumed that he was enjoying himself. At the end of the day, when he was all dressed up in his dino pajamas, he heard his phone ding.</p><p><i>[TJ \ud83c\udfc0: hey that fortune teller at your party, is she for real?]</i></p><p><i>He had swore he was having some weird form of deja vu; what he said sounded just like what Buffy had said back at the party.</i></p><p><i>[Cyrus: no, she\u2019s fake, she just likes to pretend she can see the future. why?]</i></p><p><i>[TJ \ud83c\udfc0: oh, she just said some pretty freaky stuff, like she was for real]</i></p><p><i>[Cyrus: rest assured, she cannot see the future]</i></p><p><i>[TJ \ud83c\udfc0: thank god]</i></p><p><i>[Cyrus: i, however, can. and i see you and me tomorrow at the spoon for taters]</i></p><p><i>[TJ \ud83c\udfc0: can you now? i\u2019d love to but i have practice, sorry, maybe another time]</i></p><p><i>[Cyrus: yeah totally!!]</i></p><p><i>Cyrus had really hoped those exclamation points could mask his disappointment.</i></p><p><i>18. I get disappointed easily</i></p><p><i>19. I\u2019m a burden</i></p><p>Had he already written that? He didn\u2019t know, and he frankly didn\u2019t care. If he wrote it twice, maybe it was really true.</p><p>After his bar mitzvah, things seemed to be pretty at bay. Buffy was playing well on the basketball team. Life with Andi seemed less dramatic than usual, and everyone seemed to be getting alone pretty well. That was, until he went to one of the basketball games and found TJ glaring at the court, not dressed in his uniform. He\u2019d went over to check on him, but TJ had just brushed him off.</p><p><i>20. I\u2019m a bother</i></p><p><i>21. I\u2019m nosy</i></p><p><i>\u201cEating your feelings? I do that,\u201d he\u2019d tried to lighten the mood with a joke, but TJ\u2019s face was a palette of annoyed and frustrated. The two of them had sat down at the table in the room adjacent to the court.</i></p><p><i>\u201cThink they\u2019ll win without me?\u201d TJ had asked, his mind seeming to be anywhere else but in this conversation. It was weird not seeing him on the court, Cyrus agreed.</i></p><p><i>\u201cI don\u2019t even know who they\u2019re playing,\u201d he\u2019d admitted with a shrug.</i></p><p><i>\u201cThe Raptors,\u201d TJ had sighed, \u201cI should be in that game.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you?\u201d Cyrus had asked. Way to be direct, kid.</i></p><p><i>TJ grumbled. \u201c\u2018Cause&hellip;I\u2019m failing math. They won\u2019t let me play basketball because I can\u2019t do some stupid equations. How are those things even related?\u201d</i></p><p><i>Cyrus had started putting pieces together, but he didn\u2019t want to pry. He didn\u2019t want to ruin the delicate friendship between him and TJ. \u201cMaybe you should get a different tutor,\u201d he\u2019d suggested.</i></p><p><i>TJ had just brushed him off. \u201cWhat I need is a different&hellip;brain.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Cyrus had frowned, his brows knitting into confusion. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with yours?\u201d</i></p><p><i>For the first time that day, TJ looked almost hesitant. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t work. There\u2019s a malfunction.\u201d</i></p><p><i>That was one way to put it, Cyrus had thought.</i></p><p><i>\u201cI might have this&hellip;math dyslexia,\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cDyscalculia,\u201d Cyrus had said, not missing a beat.</i></p><p><i>\u201cBuffy\u2019s the one who figured it out. She\u2019s been bugging me to talk to Coleman. Constantly on my back about it,\u201d TJ had sounded exasperated.</i></p><p><i>\u201cIt\u2019s pretty common. Not worth replacing your brain over,\u201d Cyrus had assured him, the beginnings of a smile starting to form.</i></p><p><i>TJ rolled his eyes. \u201cDude, it\u2019s a-\u201d he was cut off by a few people entering the room, and he clammed up immediately, waiting for them to leave. When he was certain they were out of earshot, he\u2019d continued.</i></p><p><i>\u201c&hellip;learning disability. I don\u2019t wanna go around announcing that,\u201d</i></p><p><i>Cyrus had felt awful; TJ didn\u2019t deserve to feel like this. \u201cDude, that\u2019s an overused buzzword. There is nothing wrong with you.\u201d</i></p><p><i>TJ seemed to almost stop frowning at that. Cyrus couldn\u2019t back it up with evidence, he had just said it.</i></p><p><i>\u201cAnd, your teacher can\u2019t fail you for having it.\u201d Of course he couldn\u2019t. He just regurgitated facts.</i></p><p><i>22. I\u2019m not helpful</i></p><p><i>\u201cColeman can\u2019t fail me,\u201d TJ had repeated, the words tasting almost strange in his mouth.</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou could be playing basketball. Right now.\u201d</i></p><p><i>TJ had groaned, leaning back in his chair. \u201cAnd Buffy\u2019s been right all along,\u201d he\u2019d mumbled, almost chuckling to himself, \u201cAt least this time I\u2019ll mean it when I tell her she\u2019s right. That really is her favorite thing to hear.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Cyrus had cringed internally. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have told you about that. She\u2019d kill me if she ever found out.\u201d</i></p><p><i>TJ had scoffed at that, shaking his head. \u201cAh, don\u2019t worry. She won\u2019t find out,\u201d he had paused for a moment, \u201cand she may have been right, but you\u2019re the one who really helped me.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Cyrus hadn\u2019t known what to say at that. He felt oddly proud of himself, and seeing TJ smile a little just made the whole moment better.</i></p><p><i>\u201cCheese puff?\u201d TJ had offered.</i></p><p><i>Cyrus shrugged. \u201cSure.\u201d</i></p><p>That day had been a good one, Cyrus had concluded. TJ had found him helpful, which almost made him want to erase the previous thing he\u2019d written. But, he figured, he\u2019d end up rewriting it anyways later, so why change it now.</p><p>Besides, what had happened later with Buffy only made him wince. How could he have been so careless as to tell TJ his best friend\u2019s weakness?</p><p><i>23. I\u2019m a bad friend</i></p><p><i>24. I\u2019m not trustworthy</i></p><p><i>25. I\u2019m a backstabber</i></p><p><i>26. I can\u2019t keep a secret</i></p><p><i>27. I\u2019m a liar</i></p><p><i>\u2018He wants to be friends with me. Who knows why?\u2019</i></p><p>He still thought about that sometimes. Why <i>did </i>TJ want to be friends with him? Not for his terrible humor, or for his nerdy jokes, that was for sure. TJ did seem to take pity on him after Buffy left.</p><p><i>\u201cCyrus, hey!\u201d TJ had called out, jogging up to Cyrus\u2019 locker, only to find him staring into the void. \u00a0He had waved his hand in front of his face. \u201cEarth to Cyrus?\u201d</i></p><p><i>Cyrus had flinched, nearly hitting his head on his own locker. \u201cHuh? Oh, hey TJ.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cSomething on your mind?\u201d</i></p><p><i>Pity. Pity was all that his mind could chant at him, but somehow, he still ended up talking. \u201cI miss Buffy,\u201d he muttered, closing his eyes. It was only his first day back at school, and he was already miserable.</i></p><p><i>TJ had slung his arm across his shoulder, tugging him down the hallway towards the cafeteria. \u201cI know you do. But hey, she\u2019s just a call or a text away right?\u201d</i></p><p><i>Cyrus just shrugged, keeping his gaze down. \u201cI guess so,\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cDo you wanna sit with me and my friends at lunch?\u201d TJ had offered.</i></p><p><i>Cyrus shook his head. \u201cNo, I\u2019m okay. Thank you though, really. I\u2019ll see you around.\u201d</i></p><p><i>28. I push people away when they just want to help</i></p><p>Cyrus seemed to be pretty good at pushing people away. No matter how much he\u2019d isolated himself from people, especially when Buffy was away, they still managed to make an effort to sneak back into his life. Well, less <i>people </i>and more <i>TJ</i>. He\u2019d even apologized to a piece of metal in order to sit down with him and Andi. And then of course, in typical Cyrus fashion, he just let his emotions flow and texted him his list of things he couldn\u2019t do.</p><p><i>29. I\u2019m pathetic</i></p><p>He\u2019d even taken time out of his day to, first of all, drag him out of the drama between Andi and Jonah, and second of all, to teach him how to do a somersault. He didn\u2019t forget how his heart fluttered after they chest bumped. It felt like it did around Jonah&hellip;well, <i>used </i>to feel around Jonah.</p><p>Even when Buffy had said that his disappeared, he had lied slightly. At this point, he didn\u2019t want to admit that his crush didn\u2019t \u201cdisappear\u201d, but it&hellip;moved, almost. It was like all his feelings transferred to TJ; the sweaty palms, the fluttering heart, and the indescribable desire to spend more time around him, preferably alone. Time spent alone with TJ was some of the best time of his life.</p><p><i>\u201cOkay, so go over this one more time?\u201d TJ had sighed, swirling his straw in his milkshake.</i></p><p><i>\u201cSo,\u201d Cyrus started, clearing his throat, \u201cI\u2019ll find a way to get Buffy to the basketball courts, and then you show up, I\u2019ll disappear, then you two can talk for a little, I\u2019ll come back and then you guys will play some one on one,\u201d</i></p><p><i>TJ had chuckled, leaning back in the booth. \u201cWow, you\u2019ve really thought about this, huh?\u201d</i></p><p><i>Cyrus was probably blushing now, and he tried to hide it by shrugging and sipping his milkshake. \u201cJust a little bit,\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cWell, it\u2019s a pretty good idea. You\u2019re full of them.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Cyrus was now for sure blushing. \u201cEh, I try.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou succeed.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Why did he have to say these things? It only made Cyrus more and more and more flustered.</i></p><p>That day was one of his fondest memories with TJ. It was also probably when he realized how intense his crush really was. And when the day came for the basketball game, it was a little shaky, but it had worked out. Heck, TJ had even performed an apology rap for Buffy.</p><p><i>\u2018I\u2019m so confused.\u2019</i></p><p>So was Cyrus that day. He didn\u2019t know why TJ had even agreed to go through all this effort just to apologize for Buffy. Maybe it\u2019d be nice to befriend someone he liked, Cyrus thought. After all, that\u2019s how it went for him and Jonah, but at least that crush was in the past.</p><p><i>30. I\u2019m stupid</i></p><p>After Buffy had decided to start her basketball team, she had enlisted in Cyrus, and Andi a little, to help put up posters. Andi made them, Cyrus had to hang them. TJ had even offered to help him do that.</p><p><i>\u201cNeed some help down there?\u201d TJ\u2019s voice had floated down the hallway, a stupid grin on his face.</i></p><p><i>Cyrus had jumped one last time to try and pin the poster up, but to no avail. \u201cIs it that obvious?\u201d</i></p><p><i>TJ had chuckled at that, plucking the poster from his hands. \u201cHuh. \u2018Girls Basketball Tryouts This Week\u2019. You trying out for the team, Underdog?\u201d</i></p><p><i>Cyrus huffed at that, crossing his arms. \u201cNo. I\u2019m just on poster-hanging duty. Which I seem to be failing at.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cHere, I\u2019ll help you,\u201d he\u2019d offered, handing the poster back to Cyrus.</i></p><p><i>Cyrus scowled, looking between the poster and TJ. \u201cI told you that I couldn\u2019t reach the-hey!\u201d</i></p><p><i>And before Cyrus knew it his feet weren\u2019t on the ground anymore. TJ had a firm grip on him, and Cyrus was just squirming.</i></p><p><i>\u201cI could do it for you but, teach a man to fish?\u201d he had repeated his mantra from when they first met each other.</i></p><p><i>\u201cTJ, put me down!\u201d Cyrus giggled, his legs kicking in the air.</i></p><p><i>TJ eventually gave in, putting him down, smiling widely. \u201cFine, fine, I\u2019ll help put them up. The normal way.\u201d</i></p><p>It had taken them way longer than expected to put up the posters, probably because they were just a chaotic duo, but Cyrus wouldn\u2019t have had it any other way. It was way more fun than expected, even if it took a long time.</p><p><i>31. I waste people\u2019s time</i></p><p>TJ was always one to push him out of his comfort zone, literally and figuratively. The day they went dirt biking was probably the epitome of that fact. The day was supposed to be a great one, seeing as he finally was getting around to meeting TJ\u2019s friends. But things turned sour once Reed had shown him the gun. And when he confronted TJ about it, he barely said anything. Worse, he didn\u2019t leave either. He was so concerned with his safety, as well as TJ\u2019s, but still managed to walk off without him.</p><p><i>32. I\u2019m careless</i></p><p>And then <i>worse</i>, he thought, was when he went to talk to Metcalf and the police about the gun. He felt so panicked the whole day after that encounter that he couldn\u2019t even eat lunch. And considering he wasn\u2019t allowed to talk to TJ all day, thanks to his friends, it felt worse. Don\u2019t get him wrong, he appreciated what Buffy and Andi did for him, but he really wanted to clear things up with TJ. When they talked it out on the swings, he had no idea why he said the things he did.</p><p><i>\u201cYou can be a little annoying, you know that?\u201d TJ had said, taking a step towards him.</i></p><p><i>33. I\u2019m annoying</i></p><p><i>\u201cWell, you can be oblivious,\u201d Cyrus had countered weakly. He didn\u2019t even know where the word oblivious came from. Oblivious to what? To the fact that sitting there with Reed was putting him in obvious danger? Or to the fact that Cyrus had an undeniable crush on him?</i></p><p><i>\u201cWell you can be very judgy,\u201d TJ had remarked, taking another step forward.</i></p><p><i>34. I\u2019m judgy</i></p><p><i>\u201cWell you can be intimidating,\u201d Cyrus had replied, and was surprised his voice wasn\u2019t wobbling.</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou know what else you are?\u201d</i></p><p><i>That sounded like a threat. TJ could fill it in with any word in the world. Nosy. Irritating. Not my friend. He had told himself to keep his composure.</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhat?\u201d How he had managed to say that without his voice breaking was beyond him.</i></p><p><i>\u201cThe only person I can talk to like this,\u201d he had said softer. Cyrus thought he was going to faint; he said what? He couldn\u2019t help but smile at that.</i></p><p>That day seemed like light years away now, so far that it was nothing but a mere memory. He almost wishes he was back on the swingset with TJ, just swinging mindlessly. Or maybe he wants to go back to playing ping-pong with him and Jonah after they\u2019d resolved their issues. It had been a bit of a stressful day for the most part, but seeing Jonah and TJ make up made it all worth it. Although, when they were talking about \u2018stuff\u2019 they had to do with, Cyrus had chickened out and said something about flamingos. He barely remembered, but he knew it was a lie. They\u2019d played a few more round until Jonah decided to head over to the Red Rooster with Andi, leaving him and TJ.</p><p><i>\u201cSo, flamingos, huh?\u201d TJ had chuckled, picking up the ping-pong balls that remained on the floor.</i></p><p><i>Cyrus had just shrugged, trying to ignore the fact that his heart was hammering in his chest: a clear sign that he was lying. Couple that with feeling like he couldn\u2019t swallow, and you had a recipe for disaster.</i></p><p><i>\u201cYup,\u201d he squeaked, putting the paddles on top of each other, \u201creal and plastic,\u201d</i></p><p><i>TJ had just hummed in response, leaning against the table. \u201cSo when we went to the zoo that time and you were spitting out facts about why flamingos are pink, while you pointed at them&hellip;your fear just happened to disappear then?\u201d</i></p><p><i>Cyrus gulped, trailing his finger around the rim of the paddles. \u201cThat&hellip;that\u2019s the day it started?\u201d he\u2019s said, but it sounded like a question.</i></p><p><i>TJ\u2019s expression had softened, and he\u2019d come up to Cyrus, putting his hand on his shoulder. \u201cStuff?\u201d</i></p><p><i>Cyrus nodded weakly in response. \u201cYeah, stuff,\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cSwings?\u201d TJ had offered.</i></p><p><i>Cyrus shook his head, nodding over to the stairs. \u201cStairs,\u201d he\u2019d mumbled, going and taking a seat on the second to the last stair. TJ had sat down beside him, and he didn\u2019t push him to talk. He knew Cyrus would talk when he was good and ready.</i></p><p><i>\u201cLook,\u201d he started, \u201cthis&hellip;this is something that I think about a lot, you know? It\u2019s not&hellip;something I\u2019m ashamed of, I just don\u2019t tell people that I don\u2019t trust,\u201d he admitted.</i></p><p><i>\u201cUnless you killed someone I swear I\u2019ll keep whatever you tell me a secret,\u201d TJ had promised, crossing his heart, \u201cand even then, I\u2019d help you hide the body.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Cyrus breathed out a laugh at that. \u201cNo, it\u2019s not that it\u2019s&hellip;I don\u2019t like girls,\u201d he said lamely, waving his hands in the air a little, \u201cI mean, I-I like guys. Like, in a romantic way,\u201d</i></p><p><i>TJ had remained quiet for a moment, waiting to see if Cyrus had anything else to say, but when he didn\u2019t he just nudged him lightly. \u201cI\u2019m glad you told me. It was brave,\u201d he paused, looking up to face him, \u201cyou\u2019re brave, Cyrus. Braver than you give yourself credit for,\u201d</i></p><p><i>Cyrus had smiled softly, breathing out and feeling like the oxygen was actually getting to his lungs. \u201cSo&hellip;we\u2019re still cool? You and me?\u201d</i></p><p><i>TJ had scoffed, nudging him once more. \u201cOf course we are! It\u2019ll take a lot more than this for things to be not cool between us.\u201d</i></p><p>He kept thinking about that day; what if it wasn\u2019t the best time to come out to TJ? What if he actually did think it was weird and was just trying to keep the situation as light as possible? All these what ifs, Cyrus concluded, could be boiled down.</p><p><i>35. I\u2019m gay</i></p><p>He sighed, staring at that statement for a while. It was true, but the idea that TJ could hate him for something he couldn\u2019t control&hellip;it hurt a lot. Almost too much, but he had to write down <i>every </i>possibility, <i>every </i>possible thing.</p><p><i>36. I\u2019m weird</i></p><p>That one was a little more general, he supposed. Weird could cover a lot of things, not just being who he was, but all his nerdy hyperfixations, the way he acted around people, and his choice to never really go out with friends to parties. Too many reasons to list, so it was all boiled down to one word.</p><p>One word. That seemed to be all TJ could say after his dance recital that one weekend.</p><p><i>He\u2019d finished the routine and was in the locker room wrapping up and putting his things into his duffel bag when they door swung open. TJ was walking his way, a hand behind his back.</i></p><p><i>\u201cWow,\u201d he\u2019d said, a gentle smile on his face.</i></p><p><i>Cyrus waited for him to say more, even along the lines of how ridiculous he\u2019d looked on stage, flopping around like boiled pasta, but he didn\u2019t say anything else.</i></p><p><i>\u201cWow? That\u2019s it?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cWow, wow,\u201d he repeated, pulling out a small dandelion from behind his back and handing it to Cyrus with a sheepish smile on his face, \u201c&hellip;wow,\u201d</i></p><p><i>Cyrus had accepted the flower graciously, and TJ had said something about catching up with his sister before he left for practice.</i></p><p><i>37. I\u2019m a bad dancer</i></p><p>TJ somehow knew that dandelions were Cyrus\u2019 favorite, probably from the numerous times he\u2019d said that. He always knew just what to bring to every event, even to his Bubbe Rose\u2019 shiva. How did he know to bring challah bread?</p><p><i>\u201cHey, Cyrus,\u201d TJ had caught him alone, after the others had left and his family was cleaning dishes up and packing away food.</i></p><p><i>\u201cTJ, hi,\u201d he\u2019d returned with a small smile, stacking one plate on top of another, \u201cyou know we\u2019re wrapping up and all, you can go home,\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI know,\u201d he\u2019d said, putting his hands in his pockets, \u201cI just wanted to say that&hellip;I\u2019m sorry for your loss. I know that she was really important to you, and I don\u2019t know how much it\u2019s going to mean coming from me, but&hellip;she cares about you a lot. We all do,\u201d he\u2019d gestured vaguely to the people around the room.</i></p><p><i>Cyrus had felt like crying right then and there, but he didn\u2019t, somehow. He just smiled wider than before. \u201cThat does mean a lot, thank you, really. I know she does, I just&hellip;I miss her a lot already,\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI know, and&hellip;if you ever want to talk about anything, tell me stories about her, or you just want me to distract you from this with a basketball story, I\u2019m there.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cThank you, TJ. That means a lot.\u201d</i></p><p>How had things managed to go from almost perfect, to the disastrous state that they were in now? He wanted to say that he didn\u2019t understand, but he did. He knew that it had to do with himself, because that always seemed to be the problem. <i>He </i>always seemed to be the problem. The things he wrote just started to spill out of him.</p><p><i>38. I\u2019m not worthy</i></p><p><i>39. I\u2019m always the problem</i></p><p><i>40. I\u2019m there when I\u2019m not wanted</i></p><p><i>41. I\u2019m a second-best person</i></p><p><i>42. I\u2019m not attractive</i></p><p><i>43. I isolate myself from people</i></p><p><i>44. I\u2019m a disaster</i></p><p><i>45. I\u2019m annoying</i></p><p>He stopped writing for a second; the last words he\u2019d written looked familiar. He scanned over the list and found that he\u2019d written \u2018I\u2019m annoying\u2019 three times. Sighing, he set the pen down and closed his eyes. Annoying. He\u2019d written it so many times, that was probably the main reason, he deducted. With a shaky hand, he folded up the paper and shoved it into a backpack pocket of his. He didn\u2019t feel particularly upset, he just felt numb, and a little tired. He managed to trudge down the stairs, where his mom was sitting and cutting up some vegetables for tonight\u2019s dinner.</p><p>\u201cCyrus, sweetie, how are you feeling?\u201d she asked sweetly, wiping her hands on the towel.</p><p>He just shrugged, unable to maintain eye contact for longer than a second. \u201cNot&hellip;great. Is it okay if I stay home from school tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>She softened at that, coming over to him and giving his shoulder a light squeeze. \u201cI know you\u2019re upset, but avoiding-\u201d</p><p>\u201c-just one day, please mom. I swear I\u2019ll go back the day after. I promise. I just need tomorrow,\u201d he pleaded, looking up at her, eyes filled with a layer of unshed tears.</p><p>She looked over his facial features for a few seconds before her shoulders relaxed, and she nodded weakly. \u201cOkay, you have tomorrow, okay? Do whatever you need to do and if you want to be alone, that\u2019s fine. If you need someone to talk to-\u201d</p><p>\u201c-I can call another therapist,\u201d Cyrus half-joked, offering a tiny smile, \u201cthanks, mom. I\u2019ll be in my room for a little while. Think I\u2019ll just take a nap.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, watching him worriedly as he walked up the stairs and quietly shut the door to his room with a gentle click. He collapsed onto his bed, and he lied there forever until he felt like he couldn\u2019t breathe through his nose. When did he start crying? Cyrus didn\u2019t even know the answer to that simple question, and he was too weary to think about it. He pulled the covers over his head, closed his eyes, and waited for all the thoughts swirling around his head to settle down, before he finally fell asleep.</p><hr><p>The next time Cyrus woke up, it was pretty dark outside, and he squinted at his alarm clock. It was close to eleven thirty, and he just sighed, grabbing his phone off of his stand and opened it to check through his notifications.. A few texts from Andi and Buffy in their group chat, one from Amber about dance, and none from TJ.</p><p><b>[buffy: hey cy are you okay?]</b></p><p><b>[andi: yeah, we\u2019re worried. but we\u2019ll talk to you tomorrow]</b></p><p><b>[cyrus: i\u2019m not going tomorrow, i don\u2019t feel well]</b></p><p><b>[andi: are you okay? do you need soup or something?]</b></p><p><b>[buffy: yeah do you need us to come over?]</b></p><p><b>[cyrus: no that\u2019s fine, it\u2019s not that bad, but i did manage to convince my mom to let me stay home]</b></p><p><b>[buffy: the talented actor mr cyrus goodman]</b></p><p><b>[cyrus: i\u2019m not lying, it\u2019s the truth, it\u2019s just not the worst pain i could be in]</b></p><p><b>[andi: well if you need anything, just text us]</b></p><p><b>[cyrus: i will, i love you guys]</b></p><p><b>[buffy: we love you too!]</b></p><p><b>[andi: &lt;3]</b></p><p>Cyrus felt drained just from that short conversation, and he put his phone aside, staring up at the ceiling. It irked him that TJ hadn\u2019t sent him a text, especially after what had happened. If he wanted to apologize, which maybe he didn\u2019t, a text would have been a start, because on Costume Day, there was nothing more than a few \u2018I\u2019m sorrys\u2019 and \u2018I should have called\u2019. It wasn\u2019t enough, not in the slightest, but as the days went on, desperation started to seep in, and Cyrus tried to convince himself that it was enough of an apology for him to just forget all of this happened. But no matter how many times he said that to himself in the mirror, he never could actually, genuinely believe himself. After a little more thinking about the matter, he pulled the covers back over his head, and fell asleep again.</p><hr><p>\u201cC\u2019mon, c\u2019mon,\u201d TJ muttered under his breath, scanning through the hallway to try and find a certain brown-eyed boy walking through the hallways. But the more time that passed, the more his hope drained, and he retreated to his locker. Thankfully, he saw Buffy and Andi walking together, and nearly pushed people over to talk to them.</p><p>\u201cHave you guys seen Cyrus today?\u201d He asked, nearly out of breath, and looking mildly disheveled.</p><p>The two girls exchanged looks, not really wanting to talk to TJ at the moment, but they just gave him cold gazes. \u201cHe\u2019s sick,\u201d Buffy said simply.</p><p>\u201cWait, what? It\u2019s, like, basically summer,\u201d TJ sputtered, rubbing the back of his neck.</p><p>Andi shrugged. \u201cAll I know is that he said he felt too tired and too weak to come to school today. Should be back tomorrow,\u201d she said curtly, pivoting on her foot and heading to her next class, Buffy following close behind.</p><p>TJ just stood in the middle of the hallway, dumbfounded. Cyrus wasn\u2019t in school today, and he couldn\u2019t help but feel like it was his fault. Tired and weak, they\u2019d said. That didn\u2019t sound like a typical cold, and he tried not to jump to the worst possible conclusion, but his mind didn\u2019t allow him to do that. Cyrus was home because he wanted to avoid him. He couldn\u2019t come to school because of TJ.</p><hr><p>The whole day, TJ had been distracted. He couldn\u2019t shake this vague nausea, because it was his fault. It was always his fault, it seemed. Everything was. He couldn\u2019t concentrate in school, he missed almost all of his shots in basketball practice, and he didn\u2019t get any of his homework done. All he did was stare at the words on the page and let them turn to mush as he shut the book angrily, rubbing his eyes harshly. He turned off the lamp and just scrolled through his phone. He wanted to send Cyrus a text, but he was too afraid. Too much of a coward. He\u2019d typed out so many messages in his notes, but never sent any of them.</p><p>Overwhelmed by emotions, he shut his phone off and tried to sleep. It was a fitful attempt to sleep, and he was tossing and turning all night long, it felt like. He was sure that he had fallen asleep at some point, because after what felt like a longer blink, his alarm went off, and he just knocked it over to the ground with a groan.</p><hr><p>Cyrus wished that he felt better after a day of just sleeping and watching YouTube videos, but he didn\u2019t. He still felt just as drained and upset, if not moreso. When his mom served him breakfast, he told her that he wasn\u2019t hungry, but that he was alright.</p><p>Having not done his homework due yesterday, he just circled random answers on the worksheets, and shoved papers into his backpack with a weak sense of urgency. He didn\u2019t know how he was going to make it through the day without Andi and Buffy asking him a ton of questions. Don\u2019t get him wrong, he loved them to death, but today was a day where he really couldn\u2019t deal with talking to people, even them.</p><p>\u201cHave a good day at school, Cyrus,\u201d his mom called after him as he opened the door.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll try,\u201d he mumbled, heading on his way. Sometimes TJ would wait for him in the morning, running from his hand and then the two of them would make their way to school, nearly hand in hand. The space around him felt almost too big as he walked, and he felt so small.</p><hr><p>The bell was too loud, there were too many students, and Cyrus felt like a stranger in the school, only having been gone for a day, though. He almost forgot his locker combination, because his brain only wanted to focus on how weak his knees felt.</p><p>\u201cCyrus!\u201d</p><p>All his thoughts came to a screeching halt at that sound. He knew damn well who it was, but all his brain seemed to chant was \u2018danger, danger, pain, pain, pain, sadness\u2019. He didn\u2019t turn around, he didn\u2019t even zip up his bag all the way, he just ran, who knows to what class. If his gym teacher could see him now, he would be beyond proud. Fortunately for him, he was running in the right direction, and ended up in his math class, nearly out of breath. He picked a seat near the back and tried to make sure that his teacher wouldn\u2019t call on him. Unzipping his bag, he pulled out his notebook from his big pocket, and then a pencil from his small one.</p><p><i>Huh</i>, he thought, zipping up the smaller pocket, <i>it was kind of open</i>. He tried not to linger on that for too long, as his teacher was about to start another lesson.</p><hr><p>TJ could only watch him run off as he stood there. He felt his heart sinking deeper and deeper into his stomach, and was about to turn and walk off a small piece of paper fluttered near the corner of the pod of lockers. Moving with utmost casualty, he walked over and picked it up before walking to his next class. While TJ usually loved history, the piece of paper burning in his pocket demanded attention. He took his usual seat near the back of the classroom, and as his teacher started talking about the Civil War, he quietly pulled out the paper and smoothed it out under his desk.</p><p>He was a little confused at first; it was a list of insults someone had written about themselves. A quick glance over revealed that they had written \u2018I\u2019m annoying\u2019 three times before they stopped. He squinted at the writing, and more he looked at it, the more worried he got. It looked an awful lot like Cyrus\u2019 handwriting. His y\u2019s were always curled at the bottom just so, his a\u2019s were never fully closed, and the way he drew his 2\u2019s were just like the ones on the page.</p><p>TJ felt his whole chest seize up. If Cyrus really did write this, which was becoming a much more real possibility with each passing moment, he couldn\u2019t help but feel like this was his fault. Did he really make Cyrus feel like this? Like he was basically worth nothing? Putting aside his worries, he ignored whatever his history teacher was saying, and pulled out another sheet of paper, keeping Cyrus\u2019 in his lap for reference. At least it looked like he was taking notes, since his teacher seemed to pay him no mind. And when the bell rang, he shoved both pieces of paper into his pocket and bolted out the door, looking for a certain boy.</p><hr><p>Last period didn\u2019t end fast enough, so when the bell finally did ring, Cyrus was the most excited that he\u2019d been all day. He still had homework he needed to catch up on, along with today\u2019s work, but all he wanted to do when he got home was to sleep more. He was almost out the door and ready to walk home, when he felt an urgent tapping on his shoulder. Turning around, he drew in a sharp breath. TJ.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d TJ mumbled, tapping his fingers nervously against his jeans.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want, TJ?\u201d Cyrus said. And it didn\u2019t come out mean, or cruel, or cold. It was just tired, like he was on his way to something.</p><p>\u201cThis is only going to take a few minutes, please,\u201d he practically begged, the urgency in his tone only growing. Being too tired to resist, Cyrus just shrugged, and TJ, wasting no more time, grabbed his wrist and dragged him towards an empty classroom, shutting the door behind him.</p><p>\u201cHurry up, I have things to do,\u201d Cyrus mumbled, taking a seat on the top of a desk.</p><p>TJ nodded, and shakily pulled out a piece of paper from his pocket. He felt like he was going to be sick, but he quickly handed it to Cyrus. When the other boy saw the paper, he immediately folded it back up, holding it close to his chest.</p><p>\u201cWh-where did you <i>find </i>this?\u201d Cyrus squeaked, his voice on the edge of cracking.</p><p>\u201cIt was on the floor by some of the lockers,\u201d he said softly, taking one of the chairs from under a desk and sitting in it, \u201cwhen?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus glanced up from his hands. \u201cWhen what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen did you write it?\u201d</p><p>He toyed with the idea of lying to him. How would he know? But after a few moments of thought, he felt like there was nothing left to lose.</p><p>\u201cThe other day,\u201d he admitted softly.</p><p>\u201cDo you <i>actually </i>believe all the things you wrote? Cyrus, those are all lies,\u201d TJ said firmly, scooting a little bit closer.</p><p>Cyrus shook his head, willing himself not to start crying, not here, and certainly not now. \u201cOf course they\u2019re true,\u201d he grumbled, \u201cwhy would you hate me if they\u2019re not?\u201d</p><p>TJ froze; if the rest of Cyrus\u2019 words were a slap to the face, this was a stab right through his heart. He literally could not speak for several moments after he\u2019d said that.</p><p>\u201cI&hellip;you&hellip;you think I <i>hate </i>you?\u201d He finally managed to say, his tongue feeling oddly dry.</p><p>Cyrus just shrugged again. \u201cI mean, you bailed that day,\u201d he said under his breath, kicking his legs underneath the desk.</p><p>TJ swore that if he wasn\u2019t sitting down he would have fainted. \u201cI&hellip;I mean, I\u2019m really sorry for doing that, it was a crap move on my part, and there\u2019s a sort of reason why I did but&hellip;I could never hate you, Cyrus, never.\u201d</p><p>When Cyrus didn\u2019t say anything, TJ pulled out the other piece of paper from his pocket, smoothing it out in front of him. \u201cI swear this won\u2019t take long, I\u2019m just asking you to hear me out,\u201d he looked up at Cyrus, who just motioned for him to hurry up.</p><p>TJ cleared his throat, tightly holding the piece of paper in his hand. \u201cYou\u2019re not annoying, not at all,\u201d he started, which barely garnered Cyrus\u2019 attention.</p><p>\u201cYou are strong,\u201d he continued.</p><p>\u201cWhat the heck is going on?\u201d</p><p>TJ put a hand up. \u201cJust listen. You\u2019re not helpless, if anything you\u2019re an independent person. You don\u2019t jump to conclusions too fast, if anything, you\u2019re good at reading people from a first glance,\u201d</p><p>Cyrus just furrowed his brows, listening to TJ talk. He glanced down at his list in his own hand, and it took him a few moments to realize that TJ was trying to counteract all the things that he\u2019d written on his own list.</p><p>\u201cBut I do get scared too easily,\u201d Cyrus mumbled, tracing his writing on the paper.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not a reason for anyone to hate you, Cyrus,\u201d TJ assured him, \u201cand&hellip;you\u2019re not a bad judge of character, you\u2019re actually pretty good at it. Great, even.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPitiful,\u201d Cyrus countered, crossing his arms in defense.</p><p>\u201cLies,\u201d TJ cut him off before he could say more, \u201cyou\u2019re not pitiful. And getting too comfortable with people you barely know? More like you can make friends really easily.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but,\u201d Cyrus squints down at his own list, \u201cI\u2019m scared of stupid things.\u201d</p><p>TJ shook his head. \u201cNo, you\u2019re rational. You have rational fears,\u201d he says, looking at the next thing, \u201cand \u2018wanting things that you can\u2019t have\u2019? You have goals and dreams that you want to achieve. I have <i>no </i>idea how you thought that anyone could hate you because of that. Getting happy at dumb things? Seeing you smile is one of the best part of my days, and I don\u2019t even care what you smile about. It really doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><p>If Cyrus didn\u2019t know any better, he would have thought that he and TJ were back into their normal routine. He just looked at his list, and mumbled \u201cdork.\u201d</p><p>TJ\u2019s face grew harder by the moment, and he gripped the side of the chair with his free hand to try and keep his emotions at bay. \u201cYou are <i>not </i>a dork, Cyrus. And, for that matter, you\u2019re not clingy, you\u2019re not desperate, or a geek, or cringy. Not in the slightest.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus sighed. \u201cLook TJ, I appreciate what you\u2019re trying to do here, but you don\u2019t need to pity me like this.\u201d</p><p>His eyes widened, and for a second, nothing came out of his mouth except for a squeak. \u201cYou think this is pity? This isn\u2019t pity, I\u2019m just telling you the truth about yourself, because your mind seems to only think you\u2019re the worst. Which you\u2019re not, you\u2019re my favorite person.\u201d</p><p>TJ took a deep breath before continuing. \u201cPhysical strength? What\u2019s that got to do with someone hating you? You don\u2019t get disappointed easily, I know that for a fact, and,\u201d he pauses, hesitantly reaching up and placing a hand on Cyrus\u2019 shoulder, \u201cyou are <i>not </i>a burden. Please don\u2019t say that about yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut,\u201d he pauses, looking down at his paper, \u201cI am a bother, and nosy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not, not at all. And also, you are <i>extremely </i>helpful, Cyrus. You haven\u2019t helped just me, but so many people. You\u2019re a great friend, and all this nonsense of not being trustworthy or anything like that? It\u2019s a complete lie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven if I do try to help people, when they try and help me, I push them away,\u201d Cyrus said, glancing at TJ\u2019s hand, which was still on his shoulder. He didn\u2019t do anything to push him off, because honestly, the contact felt nice after a period of the cold shoulder.</p><p>\u201cAnd people should hate you for that? It\u2019s a coping mechanism, you should know that better than anyone,\u201d TJ informed him, \u201cand you are one of the smartest people I know, Cyrus. You\u2019re not stupid, or pathetic, where did you even get that idea?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I <i>do </i>waste people\u2019s time,\u201d he countered weakly, looking down at his lap.</p><p>TJ was so upset that Cyrus actually believed the things that he\u2019d written about him, that it just made him want to crumple right then and there. \u201cYou don\u2019t. You care so much about people, and you are always there when they need it. And you have annoying on here again, but that\u2019s not true.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus glances up at him when he says that. \u201cBut you said that I was.\u201d</p><p>TJ raised his brows. \u201cI\u2019d never say that. When did I say that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat day at the swings, after the whole Reed thing. You said that I was annoying. And judgy for that matter,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>TJ sighed, bowing his head. \u201cIt&hellip;look, I\u2019m sorry for saying that, but in the heat of the moment, I was upset because&hellip;I thought I was going to lose you. And I couldn\u2019t bear that.\u201d</p><p>The two of them were quiet for a little while, the only sound being the ticking clock up on the wall. Finally, TJ looked at the next things on the list, and felt like he was going to cry.</p><p>\u201cCyrus, look at me,\u201d he said firmly, meeting the other boy\u2019s gaze, \u201cI will never, and have never, hated you because of who you are. You being gay is just part of who you are, and is not a reason for me, or anyone else for that matter, to hate you,\u201d he pauses for a moment, \u201cespecially me. It\u2019d be pretty hypocritical.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus almost smiles at that. Almost. He instead just seems to relax, a breath passing through his lips. \u201cI\u2019m still weird though.\u201d</p><p>TJ just shrugged. \u201cWeird is good though. Why would anyone want to be normal?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus gave a weak smile at that, feeling a little lighter with each of TJ\u2019s words. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t change the fact that I\u2019m a bad dancer.\u201d</p><p>TJ crossed his arms. \u201cI\u2019ve seen you in the studio, Cyrus. You\u2019re not a bad dancer. You\u2019re always smiling, and you get this little smirk on your face when you\u2019re concentrating really hard. It\u2019s cute.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus ducked his head at that, and tried to tell his mind that he was still supposed to be mad at TJ, not fall for all his compliments. Before he could even say anything else, TJ beat him to it.</p><p>\u201cYou are worthy of everything, okay? You deserve the world. If anyone\u2019s a problem, it\u2019s me, not you. And you are certainly not a second best person. You\u2019re my first choice, always have been. The fact that you isolate people is, again, a coping mechanism for when you\u2019re upset. You\u2019re not a disaster, and never have been. And I hope this time you believe me when I say you\u2019re not annoying.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus nodded weakly; it felt really nice to hear someone tell him that he was their first choice. It was like he was wanted.</p><p>\u201cAnd&hellip;don\u2019t say you\u2019re not attractive. You\u2019re&hellip;\u201d he hesitates a little, barely able to look him in the eye, \u201cyou\u2019re beautiful, Cy, okay? All of you. Your smile, your laugh, your personality especially.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus opened his mouth to say something, but again, TJ beat him to it.</p><p>\u201cKira was going to out me if I didn\u2019t do the costume with her. I\u2019m sorry that I bailed and I\u2019m sorry that I didn\u2019t let you know, I was just so scared that she was going to tell people and I didn\u2019t-\u201d</p><p>\u201c-TJ, slow down,\u201d Cyrus cut him off, reaching out for his hand and giving it a soft squeeze, \u201cI forgive you, okay? And&hellip;thank you for this. I feel a lot better now. And for the record,\u201d he laughs a little, \u201cI think you\u2019re pretty handsome yourself.\u201d</p><p>Now it was TJ\u2019s turn to try and hide his blush. He looked down at their hands, and couldn\u2019t help but smile. \u201cThanks,\u201d he mumbled bashfully, \u201cI try.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus smiled, hopping off of his desk and standing. \u201cI\u2019ve missed talking to you. What do you say we go get some ice cream and catch up?\u201d</p><p>TJ stood up with him. \u201cI\u2019d love that.\u201d</p><p>And after two rounds of ice cream and way more laughing and talking, they fell back into their normal rhythm, with a little more hand holding and hugging. But after today, their relationship was all the more stronger. When he went home that day, Cyrus through his list in the garbage, and pinned up TJ\u2019s list to the board in his room. Even when he was having a bad day, he could always look at that list and smile.</p>",

Might as well start from the very beginning, he thought to himself.</p>[[MORE]]<p>The whole thing started with that damn muffin. The muffin, he pointedly thought, that he couldn\u2019t get for himself because he was too much of a coward to cut in line and get it for himself.</p><p><i>2. I\u2019m weak</i></p><p><i>3. I\u2019m helpless</i><br><br><i>Just like Jonah said</i>, he thought, but left that unwritten. He already knew that; he didn\u2019t want it written down.<br><br>That day with the stupid muffin seemed almost like a far away dream to him. He was almost certain that TJ\u2026smiled at him? It was kind of fuzzy; if you\u2019d asked him a week ago, he\u2019d be able to tell you how many steps TJ took towards him before saying \u2018he\u2019s with me\u2019. But now, he doubted that the whole exchange even happened. All he remembered was that he looked at TJ like this monster, like someone who could and would crush him underneath his sneaker. But\u2026he didn\u2019t. He was surprisingly friendly.<br></p><p><i>4. I jump to conclusions</i></p><p><i>5. I get scared too easily</i></p><p><i>6. I\u2019m a bad judge of character</i></p><p>For days after that, Cyrus had found himself lingering over their interaction, if you could even call it that. He\u2019d absentmindedly draw a muffin on his biology notes. At lunch, he\u2019d stare at his mashed potatoes so long that Buffy had to physically prod him to make him eat. And when his parents drove him home from school, the car ride was remarkably quiet.</p><p>He really thought that that would have been the first and last time that him and TJ interacted. He was <i>fairly </i>certain that was the taller boy\u2019s name; Buffy had mentioned her disgust for him several times before. But their conversation had only just begun.</p><p>A little while later, Cyrus had found himself drenched in sweat from head to toe because oh his goodness, he couldn\u2019t stop himself from getting tongue-tied in front of the camera. And it certainly didn\u2019t help that he was with his, now-ex, crush. That only made him want to do well <i>more</i>, which of course led to a disastrous outcome. He\u2019d ended up running towards the swings to try and calm down. He\u2019d even sung that stupid song he made up in elementary school.</p><p>And then, seemingly out of nowhere, TJ popped behind him, with a compliment for his song. And Cyrus\u2026well, Cyrus just looked scared. He probably looked like a deer in the headlights from TJ\u2019s perspective. And then of course, TJ had made some joke about what he sang on the slide. Probably in a pitiful attempt to make conversation</p><p><i>7. I\u2019m pitiful</i></p><p>Somehow he\u2019d managed to convince TJ to sit and swing with him. <i>With him</i>. It felt almost natural, them sitting together on the swings. Well, not together per se, but they were on the same swing set. Separately.</p><p><i>\u2018You don\u2019t know me. I got stuff.\u2019</i></p><p>He\u2019d never forgotten those words, because in that moment, he felt almost comfortable around TJ. Like he just wanted to spill everything and get everything off his chest.</p><p><i>8. I get too comfortable with people I barely know</i></p><p>They\u2019d barely even talked that day. All that Cyrus had learned was that, apparently, TJ had things that he needed to feel better about, which to Cyrus, sounded absolutely absurd. He was the captain of the basketball team, people were borderline terrified of him, and let\u2019s be honest, he wasn\u2019t ugly. Far from it, actually, save for the insane amount of hair gel he used to wear.</p><p>And when he gave him an underdog, he barely remembered feeling so light and so effortless all at once. It felt like he was on top of the world, and that nothing could touch him. And the smile on TJ\u2019s face when he was squealing like mad\u2026it was nice to see. Even then, Cyrus could tell he didn\u2019t smile like that, or maybe even at all, much.</p><p><i>9. I\u2019m scared of stupid things</i></p><p>And then Buffy had shown up and TJ instantly put up his walls again and wanted to hurry off. And for some weird reason, Cyrus didn\u2019t want him to leave. He wanted his new\u2026friend? (if he could call him that) to make sure that he knew that Buffy was cool, and understanding when she wanted to be.</p><p><i>10. I want things that I can\u2019t have</i></p><p><i>\u2018Thanks for reminding me about swinging. That helped.\u2019</i></p><p>For once that day, he felt useful, like he\u2019d been successful in making someone just a little bit happier. He\u2019d gone home that day feeling pretty good about himself. Even his parents seemed to notice his good mood, but when they asked him about it, he just shrugged it off, saying that he\u2019d found a few dollars on his way in to school. He was fairly certain they didn\u2019t believe him, but they didn\u2019t pry anymore, simply letting them eat his dinner in peace.</p><p><i>11. I get happy at dumb things</i></p><p>A few days after their encounter at the swings, TJ somehow managed to find Cyrus again in the hallway. He looked oddly stressed, and he didn\u2019t have the same easygoing \u2018shrug it off\u2019 demeanor that he\u2019d sported just a few days ago. He looked like he wanted to say something, Cyrus could tell by the way he\u2019d carried himself. He hadn\u2019t forgotten their conversation from that day.</p><p><i>\u201cSomething on your mind?\u201d Cyrus had asked, rocking back on his heels.</i></p><p><i>TJ had just shrugged, tugging on his hoodie straps. \u201cJust\u2026stuff,\u201d he\u2019d said lamely, but Cyrus could see behind his indifferent demeanor.</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to tell me now, or ever,\u201d Cyrus had assured him, and was ready to walk off when TJ started pulling something out of his back pocket.</i></p><p><i>\u201cHere,\u201d he mumbled, handing Cyrus his phone, \u201cput your number in and I\u2019ll\u2026tell you about it sometime, I guess,\u201d</i></p><p><i>Cyrus had nearly dropped the boy\u2019s phone from pure shock. TJ was asking for his number? Well, no. More like TJ didn\u2019t want to talk right now and instead wanted a second method of communication.</i></p><p><i>\u201cO-Okay,\u201d Cyrus had stammered out, putting his phone number in, all the while thinking about what he would write for his contact name. He wanted to make it something a little creative, but not something so stupid that it was embarrassing.</i></p><p><i>\u2018Cyrus (Underdog)\u2019 he typed out, before handing it back to TJ. He had glanced down at his phone, and Cyrus had sworn he saw the ghost of a smile.</i></p><p><i>\u201cCool, I\u2019ll text you,\u201d he\u2019d said, before running up to catch up with his basketball friends.</i></p><p><i>He\u2019d waited all weekend for TJ to text him, but he never had. He\u2019d even sent him a text himself.</i></p><p><i>[Cyrus: hey it\u2019s cyrus! but you probably know that, anyways i\u2019m here to listen if you ever want to talk :)]</i></p><p><i>He regretted it the moment he\u2019d sent it.</i></p><p><i>12. I\u2019m a dork</i></p><p><i>13. I\u2019m clingy</i></p><p>When it had come time to invite people to his bar mitzvah, the last invitation was almost shaking in his hand. Why he was so nervous to hand it to TJ was beyond him, but looking back, a crush was definitely forming. Hindsight truly was a savior. He really, <i>really </i>wanted TJ to come, so much that he probably sounded desperate when he asked.</p><p><i>14. I\u2019m desperate</i></p><p><i>15. I\u2019m a geek</i></p><p>Luckily for him, TJ had accepted; heck, he\u2019d even smiled at him. And then, he launched into a conversation about Buffy. Something about needing her to do something for him. And there it was, he thought, the reason that TJ had even talked to him at all. He need a favor. What? A date? Her number? TJ had ended up being pretty vague about the whole ordeal.</p><p><i>\u201cJust use her two favorite words,\u201d Cyrus had said confidently.</i></p><p><i>\u201cI\u2019m sorry?\u201d</i></p><p><i>He\u2019d paled, eyes bugging out of his head. \u201cNo, she hates those words,\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cThen what?\u201d</i></p><p><i>Cyrus had hesitated. On the one hand, he did want to keep talking to TJ. On the other hand, he didn\u2019t want to say something he shouldn\u2019t. But one look up to him, seeing him almost smiling, he nodding up the sidewalk.</i></p><p><i>\u201cCome with me. You might not like saying this, but Buffy will love hearing it.\u201d The two of them had walked out towards the bus stop at the front of the school. After checking to see if the coast was clear, no Buffy in sight, Cyrus had stepped in front of TJ.</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d he\u2019d said.</i></p><p><i>TJ furrowed his brows in confusion. \u201cAbout what?\u201d</i></p><p><i>Cyrus shook his head. \u201cNo, those are her favorite words. \u2018You\u2019re right\u2019. I don\u2019t know what it is about them, but she just\u2026seems to cave at whatever when you say them. It\u2019s how I got her to sell me Tokyo,\u201d</i></p><p><i>TJ looked at him, even more confused than before, but there was an air of fondness in his gaze.</i></p><p><i>Cyrus waved him off. \u201cMonopoly. Long story.\u201d</i></p><p><i>TJ nodded curtly, upon hearing the bus beep. \u201cMaybe you could tell me sometime,\u201d he offered, shaking his phone, \u201cyou can use emojis and everything,\u201d he\u2019d joked, before waving and heading onto the bus.</i></p><p><i>Cyrus couldn\u2019t wipe that stupid smile off of his face no matter how hard he tried.</i></p><p><i>Sure enough, when he got home that night, he sent TJ a long text explaining how he just needed Tokyo to complete his collection, but Buffy wouldn\u2019t sell it to him. He didn\u2019t really remember what had happened, other than the fact that he\u2019d said \u2018you\u2019re right\u2019 so many times it started to sound like a foreign language.</i></p><p><i>And this time, TJ did send him a text back</i></p><p><i>[TJ \ud83c\udfc0: lol that\u2019s funny. i\u2019ll remember that. thanks for today]</i></p><p>Cyrus almost smiled as he added new things to the list. Memories of his bar mitzvah were fond, and he wishes times could be as simple as they were back then. He hadn\u2019t seen TJ that much, save for the time that he couldn\u2019t open a damn bottle.</p><p><i>\u201cHey, Underdog!\u201d TJ had said above the music, approaching him.</i></p><p><i>Cyrus had just groaned in response, his shoulders slumping, He set the bottle back down on the table and swiped at his hairline. \u201cHey, TJ,\u201d</i></p><p><i>TJ had looked between Cyrus and the bottle. \u201cNeed some help?\u201d</i></p><p><i>Cyrus shook his head. \u201cNo, I\u2019m supposed to do this myself, you know. Be a man and all that jazz,\u201d he chuckles, cringing inwardly.</i></p><p><i>16. I\u2019m cringy</i></p><p><i>17. I have no physical strength</i></p><p><i>TJ nodded, putting his hands in his pocket, before he\u2019d stepped forward and grabbed the bottle. Cyrus had started to panic a little, but TJ assured him things would be fine. He\u2019d started to open the bottle, just a little, and then had quickly handed it over to Cyrus to finish it off.</i></p><p><i>\u201cAll yours, dude,\u201d he whispered, discreetly shuffling back towards the dance floor. Cyrus had stood stunned for a few moments, before he came to his senses and opened the bottle the rest of the way. It made a satisfying \u2018pop!\u2019 and the foam spilled over the neck. All of his family and friends were clapping, and if he squinted, he could see TJ, clapping his hands and smiling.</i></p><p>Things seemed near perfect that day. He hadn\u2019t seen TJ for the rest of the party, but he assumed that he was enjoying himself. At the end of the day, when he was all dressed up in his dino pajamas, he heard his phone ding.</p><p><i>[TJ \ud83c\udfc0: hey that fortune teller at your party, is she for real?]</i></p><p><i>He had swore he was having some weird form of deja vu; what he said sounded just like what Buffy had said back at the party.</i></p><p><i>[Cyrus: no, she\u2019s fake, she just likes to pretend she can see the future. why?]</i></p><p><i>[TJ \ud83c\udfc0: oh, she just said some pretty freaky stuff, like she was for real]</i></p><p><i>[Cyrus: rest assured, she cannot see the future]</i></p><p><i>[TJ \ud83c\udfc0: thank god]</i></p><p><i>[Cyrus: i, however, can. and i see you and me tomorrow at the spoon for taters]</i></p><p><i>[TJ \ud83c\udfc0: can you now? i\u2019d love to but i have practice, sorry, maybe another time]</i></p><p><i>[Cyrus: yeah totally!!]</i></p><p><i>Cyrus had really hoped those exclamation points could mask his disappointment.</i></p><p><i>18. I get disappointed easily</i></p><p><i>19. I\u2019m a burden</i></p><p>Had he already written that? He didn\u2019t know, and he frankly didn\u2019t care. If he wrote it twice, maybe it was really true.</p><p>After his bar mitzvah, things seemed to be pretty at bay. Buffy was playing well on the basketball team. Life with Andi seemed less dramatic than usual, and everyone seemed to be getting alone pretty well. That was, until he went to one of the basketball games and found TJ glaring at the court, not dressed in his uniform. He\u2019d went over to check on him, but TJ had just brushed him off.</p><p><i>20. I\u2019m a bother</i></p><p><i>21. I\u2019m nosy</i></p><p><i>\u201cEating your feelings? I do that,\u201d he\u2019d tried to lighten the mood with a joke, but TJ\u2019s face was a palette of annoyed and frustrated. The two of them had sat down at the table in the room adjacent to the court.</i></p><p><i>\u201cThink they\u2019ll win without me?\u201d TJ had asked, his mind seeming to be anywhere else but in this conversation. It was weird not seeing him on the court, Cyrus agreed.</i></p><p><i>\u201cI don\u2019t even know who they\u2019re playing,\u201d he\u2019d admitted with a shrug.</i></p><p><i>\u201cThe Raptors,\u201d TJ had sighed, \u201cI should be in that game.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you?\u201d Cyrus had asked. Way to be direct, kid.</i></p><p><i>TJ grumbled. \u201c\u2018Cause\u2026I\u2019m failing math. They won\u2019t let me play basketball because I can\u2019t do some stupid equations. How are those things even related?\u201d</i></p><p><i>Cyrus had started putting pieces together, but he didn\u2019t want to pry. He didn\u2019t want to ruin the delicate friendship between him and TJ. \u201cMaybe you should get a different tutor,\u201d he\u2019d suggested.</i></p><p><i>TJ had just brushed him off. \u201cWhat I need is a different\u2026brain.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Cyrus had frowned, his brows knitting into confusion. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with yours?\u201d</i></p><p><i>For the first time that day, TJ looked almost hesitant. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t work. There\u2019s a malfunction.\u201d</i></p><p><i>That was one way to put it, Cyrus had thought.</i></p><p><i>\u201cI might have this\u2026math dyslexia,\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cDyscalculia,\u201d Cyrus had said, not missing a beat.</i></p><p><i>\u201cBuffy\u2019s the one who figured it out. She\u2019s been bugging me to talk to Coleman. Constantly on my back about it,\u201d TJ had sounded exasperated.</i></p><p><i>\u201cIt\u2019s pretty common. Not worth replacing your brain over,\u201d Cyrus had assured him, the beginnings of a smile starting to form.</i></p><p><i>TJ rolled his eyes. \u201cDude, it\u2019s a-\u201d he was cut off by a few people entering the room, and he clammed up immediately, waiting for them to leave. When he was certain they were out of earshot, he\u2019d continued.</i></p><p><i>\u201c\u2026learning disability. I don\u2019t wanna go around announcing that,\u201d</i></p><p><i>Cyrus had felt awful; TJ didn\u2019t deserve to feel like this. \u201cDude, that\u2019s an overused buzzword. There is nothing wrong with you.\u201d</i></p><p><i>TJ seemed to almost stop frowning at that. Cyrus couldn\u2019t back it up with evidence, he had just said it.</i></p><p><i>\u201cAnd, your teacher can\u2019t fail you for having it.\u201d Of course he couldn\u2019t. He just regurgitated facts.</i></p><p><i>22. I\u2019m not helpful</i></p><p><i>\u201cColeman can\u2019t fail me,\u201d TJ had repeated, the words tasting almost strange in his mouth.</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou could be playing basketball. Right now.\u201d</i></p><p><i>TJ had groaned, leaning back in his chair. \u201cAnd Buffy\u2019s been right all along,\u201d he\u2019d mumbled, almost chuckling to himself, \u201cAt least this time I\u2019ll mean it when I tell her she\u2019s right. That really is her favorite thing to hear.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Cyrus had cringed internally. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have told you about that. She\u2019d kill me if she ever found out.\u201d</i></p><p><i>TJ had scoffed at that, shaking his head. \u201cAh, don\u2019t worry. She won\u2019t find out,\u201d he had paused for a moment, \u201cand she may have been right, but you\u2019re the one who really helped me.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Cyrus hadn\u2019t known what to say at that. He felt oddly proud of himself, and seeing TJ smile a little just made the whole moment better.</i></p><p><i>\u201cCheese puff?\u201d TJ had offered.</i></p><p><i>Cyrus shrugged. \u201cSure.\u201d</i></p><p>That day had been a good one, Cyrus had concluded. TJ had found him helpful, which almost made him want to erase the previous thing he\u2019d written. But, he figured, he\u2019d end up rewriting it anyways later, so why change it now.</p><p>Besides, what had happened later with Buffy only made him wince. How could he have been so careless as to tell TJ his best friend\u2019s weakness?</p><p><i>23. I\u2019m a bad friend</i></p><p><i>24. I\u2019m not trustworthy</i></p><p><i>25. I\u2019m a backstabber</i></p><p><i>26. I can\u2019t keep a secret</i></p><p><i>27. I\u2019m a liar</i></p><p><i>\u2018He wants to be friends with me. Who knows why?\u2019</i></p><p>He still thought about that sometimes. Why <i>did </i>TJ want to be friends with him? Not for his terrible humor, or for his nerdy jokes, that was for sure. TJ did seem to take pity on him after Buffy left.</p><p><i>\u201cCyrus, hey!\u201d TJ had called out, jogging up to Cyrus\u2019 locker, only to find him staring into the void. \u00a0He had waved his hand in front of his face. \u201cEarth to Cyrus?\u201d</i></p><p><i>Cyrus had flinched, nearly hitting his head on his own locker. \u201cHuh? Oh, hey TJ.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cSomething on your mind?\u201d</i></p><p><i>Pity. Pity was all that his mind could chant at him, but somehow, he still ended up talking. \u201cI miss Buffy,\u201d he muttered, closing his eyes. It was only his first day back at school, and he was already miserable.</i></p><p><i>TJ had slung his arm across his shoulder, tugging him down the hallway towards the cafeteria. \u201cI know you do. But hey, she\u2019s just a call or a text away right?\u201d</i></p><p><i>Cyrus just shrugged, keeping his gaze down. \u201cI guess so,\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cDo you wanna sit with me and my friends at lunch?\u201d TJ had offered.</i></p><p><i>Cyrus shook his head. \u201cNo, I\u2019m okay. Thank you though, really. I\u2019ll see you around.\u201d</i></p><p><i>28. I push people away when they just want to help</i></p><p>Cyrus seemed to be pretty good at pushing people away. No matter how much he\u2019d isolated himself from people, especially when Buffy was away, they still managed to make an effort to sneak back into his life. Well, less <i>people </i>and more <i>TJ</i>. He\u2019d even apologized to a piece of metal in order to sit down with him and Andi. And then of course, in typical Cyrus fashion, he just let his emotions flow and texted him his list of things he couldn\u2019t do.</p><p><i>29. I\u2019m pathetic</i></p><p>He\u2019d even taken time out of his day to, first of all, drag him out of the drama between Andi and Jonah, and second of all, to teach him how to do a somersault. He didn\u2019t forget how his heart fluttered after they chest bumped. It felt like it did around Jonah\u2026well, <i>used </i>to feel around Jonah.</p><p>Even when Buffy had said that his disappeared, he had lied slightly. At this point, he didn\u2019t want to admit that his crush didn\u2019t \u201cdisappear\u201d, but it\u2026moved, almost. It was like all his feelings transferred to TJ; the sweaty palms, the fluttering heart, and the indescribable desire to spend more time around him, preferably alone. Time spent alone with TJ was some of the best time of his life.</p><p><i>\u201cOkay, so go over this one more time?\u201d TJ had sighed, swirling his straw in his milkshake.</i></p><p><i>\u201cSo,\u201d Cyrus started, clearing his throat, \u201cI\u2019ll find a way to get Buffy to the basketball courts, and then you show up, I\u2019ll disappear, then you two can talk for a little, I\u2019ll come back and then you guys will play some one on one,\u201d</i></p><p><i>TJ had chuckled, leaning back in the booth. \u201cWow, you\u2019ve really thought about this, huh?\u201d</i></p><p><i>Cyrus was probably blushing now, and he tried to hide it by shrugging and sipping his milkshake. \u201cJust a little bit,\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cWell, it\u2019s a pretty good idea. You\u2019re full of them.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Cyrus was now for sure blushing. \u201cEh, I try.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou succeed.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Why did he have to say these things? It only made Cyrus more and more and more flustered.</i></p><p>That day was one of his fondest memories with TJ. It was also probably when he realized how intense his crush really was. And when the day came for the basketball game, it was a little shaky, but it had worked out. Heck, TJ had even performed an apology rap for Buffy.</p><p><i>\u2018I\u2019m so confused.\u2019</i></p><p>So was Cyrus that day. He didn\u2019t know why TJ had even agreed to go through all this effort just to apologize for Buffy. Maybe it\u2019d be nice to befriend someone he liked, Cyrus thought. After all, that\u2019s how it went for him and Jonah, but at least that crush was in the past.</p><p><i>30. I\u2019m stupid</i></p><p>After Buffy had decided to start her basketball team, she had enlisted in Cyrus, and Andi a little, to help put up posters. Andi made them, Cyrus had to hang them. TJ had even offered to help him do that.</p><p><i>\u201cNeed some help down there?\u201d TJ\u2019s voice had floated down the hallway, a stupid grin on his face.</i></p><p><i>Cyrus had jumped one last time to try and pin the poster up, but to no avail. \u201cIs it that obvious?\u201d</i></p><p><i>TJ had chuckled at that, plucking the poster from his hands. \u201cHuh. \u2018Girls Basketball Tryouts This Week\u2019. You trying out for the team, Underdog?\u201d</i></p><p><i>Cyrus huffed at that, crossing his arms. \u201cNo. I\u2019m just on poster-hanging duty. Which I seem to be failing at.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cHere, I\u2019ll help you,\u201d he\u2019d offered, handing the poster back to Cyrus.</i></p><p><i>Cyrus scowled, looking between the poster and TJ. \u201cI told you that I couldn\u2019t reach the-hey!\u201d</i></p><p><i>And before Cyrus knew it his feet weren\u2019t on the ground anymore. TJ had a firm grip on him, and Cyrus was just squirming.</i></p><p><i>\u201cI could do it for you but, teach a man to fish?\u201d he had repeated his mantra from when they first met each other.</i></p><p><i>\u201cTJ, put me down!\u201d Cyrus giggled, his legs kicking in the air.</i></p><p><i>TJ eventually gave in, putting him down, smiling widely. \u201cFine, fine, I\u2019ll help put them up. The normal way.\u201d</i></p><p>It had taken them way longer than expected to put up the posters, probably because they were just a chaotic duo, but Cyrus wouldn\u2019t have had it any other way. It was way more fun than expected, even if it took a long time.</p><p><i>31. I waste people\u2019s time</i></p><p>TJ was always one to push him out of his comfort zone, literally and figuratively. The day they went dirt biking was probably the epitome of that fact. The day was supposed to be a great one, seeing as he finally was getting around to meeting TJ\u2019s friends. But things turned sour once Reed had shown him the gun. And when he confronted TJ about it, he barely said anything. Worse, he didn\u2019t leave either. He was so concerned with his safety, as well as TJ\u2019s, but still managed to walk off without him.</p><p><i>32. I\u2019m careless</i></p><p>And then <i>worse</i>, he thought, was when he went to talk to Metcalf and the police about the gun. He felt so panicked the whole day after that encounter that he couldn\u2019t even eat lunch. And considering he wasn\u2019t allowed to talk to TJ all day, thanks to his friends, it felt worse. Don\u2019t get him wrong, he appreciated what Buffy and Andi did for him, but he really wanted to clear things up with TJ. When they talked it out on the swings, he had no idea why he said the things he did.</p><p><i>\u201cYou can be a little annoying, you know that?\u201d TJ had said, taking a step towards him.</i></p><p><i>33. I\u2019m annoying</i></p><p><i>\u201cWell, you can be oblivious,\u201d Cyrus had countered weakly. He didn\u2019t even know where the word oblivious came from. Oblivious to what? To the fact that sitting there with Reed was putting him in obvious danger? Or to the fact that Cyrus had an undeniable crush on him?</i></p><p><i>\u201cWell you can be very judgy,\u201d TJ had remarked, taking another step forward.</i></p><p><i>34. I\u2019m judgy</i></p><p><i>\u201cWell you can be intimidating,\u201d Cyrus had replied, and was surprised his voice wasn\u2019t wobbling.</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou know what else you are?\u201d</i></p><p><i>That sounded like a threat. TJ could fill it in with any word in the world. Nosy. Irritating. Not my friend. He had told himself to keep his composure.</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhat?\u201d How he had managed to say that without his voice breaking was beyond him.</i></p><p><i>\u201cThe only person I can talk to like this,\u201d he had said softer. Cyrus thought he was going to faint; he said what? He couldn\u2019t help but smile at that.</i></p><p>That day seemed like light years away now, so far that it was nothing but a mere memory. He almost wishes he was back on the swingset with TJ, just swinging mindlessly. Or maybe he wants to go back to playing ping-pong with him and Jonah after they\u2019d resolved their issues. It had been a bit of a stressful day for the most part, but seeing Jonah and TJ make up made it all worth it. Although, when they were talking about \u2018stuff\u2019 they had to do with, Cyrus had chickened out and said something about flamingos. He barely remembered, but he knew it was a lie. They\u2019d played a few more round until Jonah decided to head over to the Red Rooster with Andi, leaving him and TJ.</p><p><i>\u201cSo, flamingos, huh?\u201d TJ had chuckled, picking up the ping-pong balls that remained on the floor.</i></p><p><i>Cyrus had just shrugged, trying to ignore the fact that his heart was hammering in his chest: a clear sign that he was lying. Couple that with feeling like he couldn\u2019t swallow, and you had a recipe for disaster.</i></p><p><i>\u201cYup,\u201d he squeaked, putting the paddles on top of each other, \u201creal and plastic,\u201d</i></p><p><i>TJ had just hummed in response, leaning against the table. \u201cSo when we went to the zoo that time and you were spitting out facts about why flamingos are pink, while you pointed at them\u2026your fear just happened to disappear then?\u201d</i></p><p><i>Cyrus gulped, trailing his finger around the rim of the paddles. \u201cThat\u2026that\u2019s the day it started?\u201d he\u2019s said, but it sounded like a question.</i></p><p><i>TJ\u2019s expression had softened, and he\u2019d come up to Cyrus, putting his hand on his shoulder. \u201cStuff?\u201d</i></p><p><i>Cyrus nodded weakly in response. \u201cYeah, stuff,\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cSwings?\u201d TJ had offered.</i></p><p><i>Cyrus shook his head, nodding over to the stairs. \u201cStairs,\u201d he\u2019d mumbled, going and taking a seat on the second to the last stair. TJ had sat down beside him, and he didn\u2019t push him to talk. He knew Cyrus would talk when he was good and ready.</i></p><p><i>\u201cLook,\u201d he started, \u201cthis\u2026this is something that I think about a lot, you know? It\u2019s not\u2026something I\u2019m ashamed of, I just don\u2019t tell people that I don\u2019t trust,\u201d he admitted.</i></p><p><i>\u201cUnless you killed someone I swear I\u2019ll keep whatever you tell me a secret,\u201d TJ had promised, crossing his heart, \u201cand even then, I\u2019d help you hide the body.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Cyrus breathed out a laugh at that. \u201cNo, it\u2019s not that it\u2019s\u2026I don\u2019t like girls,\u201d he said lamely, waving his hands in the air a little, \u201cI mean, I-I like guys. Like, in a romantic way,\u201d</i></p><p><i>TJ had remained quiet for a moment, waiting to see if Cyrus had anything else to say, but when he didn\u2019t he just nudged him lightly. \u201cI\u2019m glad you told me. It was brave,\u201d he paused, looking up to face him, \u201cyou\u2019re brave, Cyrus. Braver than you give yourself credit for,\u201d</i></p><p><i>Cyrus had smiled softly, breathing out and feeling like the oxygen was actually getting to his lungs. \u201cSo\u2026we\u2019re still cool? You and me?\u201d</i></p><p><i>TJ had scoffed, nudging him once more. \u201cOf course we are! It\u2019ll take a lot more than this for things to be not cool between us.\u201d</i></p><p>He kept thinking about that day; what if it wasn\u2019t the best time to come out to TJ? What if he actually did think it was weird and was just trying to keep the situation as light as possible? All these what ifs, Cyrus concluded, could be boiled down.</p><p><i>35. I\u2019m gay</i></p><p>He sighed, staring at that statement for a while. It was true, but the idea that TJ could hate him for something he couldn\u2019t control\u2026it hurt a lot. Almost too much, but he had to write down <i>every </i>possibility, <i>every </i>possible thing.</p><p><i>36. I\u2019m weird</i></p><p>That one was a little more general, he supposed. Weird could cover a lot of things, not just being who he was, but all his nerdy hyperfixations, the way he acted around people, and his choice to never really go out with friends to parties. Too many reasons to list, so it was all boiled down to one word.</p><p>One word. That seemed to be all TJ could say after his dance recital that one weekend.</p><p><i>He\u2019d finished the routine and was in the locker room wrapping up and putting his things into his duffel bag when they door swung open. TJ was walking his way, a hand behind his back.</i></p><p><i>\u201cWow,\u201d he\u2019d said, a gentle smile on his face.</i></p><p><i>Cyrus waited for him to say more, even along the lines of how ridiculous he\u2019d looked on stage, flopping around like boiled pasta, but he didn\u2019t say anything else.</i></p><p><i>\u201cWow? That\u2019s it?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cWow, wow,\u201d he repeated, pulling out a small dandelion from behind his back and handing it to Cyrus with a sheepish smile on his face, \u201c\u2026wow,\u201d</i></p><p><i>Cyrus had accepted the flower graciously, and TJ had said something about catching up with his sister before he left for practice.</i></p><p><i>37. I\u2019m a bad dancer</i></p><p>TJ somehow knew that dandelions were Cyrus\u2019 favorite, probably from the numerous times he\u2019d said that. He always knew just what to bring to every event, even to his Bubbe Rose\u2019 shiva. How did he know to bring challah bread?</p><p><i>\u201cHey, Cyrus,\u201d TJ had caught him alone, after the others had left and his family was cleaning dishes up and packing away food.</i></p><p><i>\u201cTJ, hi,\u201d he\u2019d returned with a small smile, stacking one plate on top of another, \u201cyou know we\u2019re wrapping up and all, you can go home,\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI know,\u201d he\u2019d said, putting his hands in his pockets, \u201cI just wanted to say that\u2026I\u2019m sorry for your loss. I know that she was really important to you, and I don\u2019t know how much it\u2019s going to mean coming from me, but\u2026she cares about you a lot. We all do,\u201d he\u2019d gestured vaguely to the people around the room.</i></p><p><i>Cyrus had felt like crying right then and there, but he didn\u2019t, somehow. He just smiled wider than before. \u201cThat does mean a lot, thank you, really. I know she does, I just\u2026I miss her a lot already,\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI know, and\u2026if you ever want to talk about anything, tell me stories about her, or you just want me to distract you from this with a basketball story, I\u2019m there.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cThank you, TJ. That means a lot.\u201d</i></p><p>How had things managed to go from almost perfect, to the disastrous state that they were in now? He wanted to say that he didn\u2019t understand, but he did. He knew that it had to do with himself, because that always seemed to be the problem. <i>He </i>always seemed to be the problem. The things he wrote just started to spill out of him.</p><p><i>38. I\u2019m not worthy</i></p><p><i>39. I\u2019m always the problem</i></p><p><i>40. I\u2019m there when I\u2019m not wanted</i></p><p><i>41. I\u2019m a second-best person</i></p><p><i>42. I\u2019m not attractive</i></p><p><i>43. I isolate myself from people</i></p><p><i>44. I\u2019m a disaster</i></p><p><i>45. I\u2019m annoying</i></p><p>He stopped writing for a second; the last words he\u2019d written looked familiar. He scanned over the list and found that he\u2019d written \u2018I\u2019m annoying\u2019 three times. Sighing, he set the pen down and closed his eyes. Annoying. He\u2019d written it so many times, that was probably the main reason, he deducted. With a shaky hand, he folded up the paper and shoved it into a backpack pocket of his. He didn\u2019t feel particularly upset, he just felt numb, and a little tired. He managed to trudge down the stairs, where his mom was sitting and cutting up some vegetables for tonight\u2019s dinner.</p><p>\u201cCyrus, sweetie, how are you feeling?\u201d she asked sweetly, wiping her hands on the towel.</p><p>He just shrugged, unable to maintain eye contact for longer than a second. \u201cNot\u2026great. Is it okay if I stay home from school tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>She softened at that, coming over to him and giving his shoulder a light squeeze. \u201cI know you\u2019re upset, but avoiding-\u201d</p><p>\u201c-just one day, please mom. I swear I\u2019ll go back the day after. I promise. I just need tomorrow,\u201d he pleaded, looking up at her, eyes filled with a layer of unshed tears.</p><p>She looked over his facial features for a few seconds before her shoulders relaxed, and she nodded weakly. \u201cOkay, you have tomorrow, okay? Do whatever you need to do and if you want to be alone, that\u2019s fine. If you need someone to talk to-\u201d</p><p>\u201c-I can call another therapist,\u201d Cyrus half-joked, offering a tiny smile, \u201cthanks, mom. I\u2019ll be in my room for a little while. Think I\u2019ll just take a nap.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, watching him worriedly as he walked up the stairs and quietly shut the door to his room with a gentle click. He collapsed onto his bed, and he lied there forever until he felt like he couldn\u2019t breathe through his nose. When did he start crying? Cyrus didn\u2019t even know the answer to that simple question, and he was too weary to think about it. He pulled the covers over his head, closed his eyes, and waited for all the thoughts swirling around his head to settle down, before he finally fell asleep.</p><hr><p>The next time Cyrus woke up, it was pretty dark outside, and he squinted at his alarm clock. It was close to eleven thirty, and he just sighed, grabbing his phone off of his stand and opened it to check through his notifications.. A few texts from Andi and Buffy in their group chat, one from Amber about dance, and none from TJ.</p><p><b>[buffy: hey cy are you okay?]</b></p><p><b>[andi: yeah, we\u2019re worried. but we\u2019ll talk to you tomorrow]</b></p><p><b>[cyrus: i\u2019m not going tomorrow, i don\u2019t feel well]</b></p><p><b>[andi: are you okay? do you need soup or something?]</b></p><p><b>[buffy: yeah do you need us to come over?]</b></p><p><b>[cyrus: no that\u2019s fine, it\u2019s not that bad, but i did manage to convince my mom to let me stay home]</b></p><p><b>[buffy: the talented actor mr cyrus goodman]</b></p><p><b>[cyrus: i\u2019m not lying, it\u2019s the truth, it\u2019s just not the worst pain i could be in]</b></p><p><b>[andi: well if you need anything, just text us]</b></p><p><b>[cyrus: i will, i love you guys]</b></p><p><b>[buffy: we love you too!]</b></p><p><b>[andi: &lt;3]</b></p><p>Cyrus felt drained just from that short conversation, and he put his phone aside, staring up at the ceiling. It irked him that TJ hadn\u2019t sent him a text, especially after what had happened. If he wanted to apologize, which maybe he didn\u2019t, a text would have been a start, because on Costume Day, there was nothing more than a few \u2018I\u2019m sorrys\u2019 and \u2018I should have called\u2019. It wasn\u2019t enough, not in the slightest, but as the days went on, desperation started to seep in, and Cyrus tried to convince himself that it was enough of an apology for him to just forget all of this happened. But no matter how many times he said that to himself in the mirror, he never could actually, genuinely believe himself. After a little more thinking about the matter, he pulled the covers back over his head, and fell asleep again.</p><hr><p>\u201cC\u2019mon, c\u2019mon,\u201d TJ muttered under his breath, scanning through the hallway to try and find a certain brown-eyed boy walking through the hallways. But the more time that passed, the more his hope drained, and he retreated to his locker. Thankfully, he saw Buffy and Andi walking together, and nearly pushed people over to talk to them.</p><p>\u201cHave you guys seen Cyrus today?\u201d He asked, nearly out of breath, and looking mildly disheveled.</p><p>The two girls exchanged looks, not really wanting to talk to TJ at the moment, but they just gave him cold gazes. \u201cHe\u2019s sick,\u201d Buffy said simply.</p><p>\u201cWait, what? It\u2019s, like, basically summer,\u201d TJ sputtered, rubbing the back of his neck.</p><p>Andi shrugged. \u201cAll I know is that he said he felt too tired and too weak to come to school today. Should be back tomorrow,\u201d she said curtly, pivoting on her foot and heading to her next class, Buffy following close behind.</p><p>TJ just stood in the middle of the hallway, dumbfounded. Cyrus wasn\u2019t in school today, and he couldn\u2019t help but feel like it was his fault. Tired and weak, they\u2019d said. That didn\u2019t sound like a typical cold, and he tried not to jump to the worst possible conclusion, but his mind didn\u2019t allow him to do that. Cyrus was home because he wanted to avoid him. He couldn\u2019t come to school because of TJ.</p><hr><p>The whole day, TJ had been distracted. He couldn\u2019t shake this vague nausea, because it was his fault. It was always his fault, it seemed. Everything was. He couldn\u2019t concentrate in school, he missed almost all of his shots in basketball practice, and he didn\u2019t get any of his homework done. All he did was stare at the words on the page and let them turn to mush as he shut the book angrily, rubbing his eyes harshly. He turned off the lamp and just scrolled through his phone. He wanted to send Cyrus a text, but he was too afraid. Too much of a coward. He\u2019d typed out so many messages in his notes, but never sent any of them.</p><p>Overwhelmed by emotions, he shut his phone off and tried to sleep. It was a fitful attempt to sleep, and he was tossing and turning all night long, it felt like. He was sure that he had fallen asleep at some point, because after what felt like a longer blink, his alarm went off, and he just knocked it over to the ground with a groan.</p><hr><p>Cyrus wished that he felt better after a day of just sleeping and watching YouTube videos, but he didn\u2019t. He still felt just as drained and upset, if not moreso. When his mom served him breakfast, he told her that he wasn\u2019t hungry, but that he was alright.</p><p>Having not done his homework due yesterday, he just circled random answers on the worksheets, and shoved papers into his backpack with a weak sense of urgency. He didn\u2019t know how he was going to make it through the day without Andi and Buffy asking him a ton of questions. Don\u2019t get him wrong, he loved them to death, but today was a day where he really couldn\u2019t deal with talking to people, even them.</p><p>\u201cHave a good day at school, Cyrus,\u201d his mom called after him as he opened the door.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll try,\u201d he mumbled, heading on his way. Sometimes TJ would wait for him in the morning, running from his hand and then the two of them would make their way to school, nearly hand in hand. The space around him felt almost too big as he walked, and he felt so small.</p><hr><p>The bell was too loud, there were too many students, and Cyrus felt like a stranger in the school, only having been gone for a day, though. He almost forgot his locker combination, because his brain only wanted to focus on how weak his knees felt.</p><p>\u201cCyrus!\u201d</p><p>All his thoughts came to a screeching halt at that sound. He knew damn well who it was, but all his brain seemed to chant was \u2018danger, danger, pain, pain, pain, sadness\u2019. He didn\u2019t turn around, he didn\u2019t even zip up his bag all the way, he just ran, who knows to what class. If his gym teacher could see him now, he would be beyond proud. Fortunately for him, he was running in the right direction, and ended up in his math class, nearly out of breath. He picked a seat near the back and tried to make sure that his teacher wouldn\u2019t call on him. Unzipping his bag, he pulled out his notebook from his big pocket, and then a pencil from his small one.</p><p><i>Huh</i>, he thought, zipping up the smaller pocket, <i>it was kind of open</i>. He tried not to linger on that for too long, as his teacher was about to start another lesson.</p><hr><p>TJ could only watch him run off as he stood there. He felt his heart sinking deeper and deeper into his stomach, and was about to turn and walk off a small piece of paper fluttered near the corner of the pod of lockers. Moving with utmost casualty, he walked over and picked it up before walking to his next class. While TJ usually loved history, the piece of paper burning in his pocket demanded attention. He took his usual seat near the back of the classroom, and as his teacher started talking about the Civil War, he quietly pulled out the paper and smoothed it out under his desk.</p><p>He was a little confused at first; it was a list of insults someone had written about themselves. A quick glance over revealed that they had written \u2018I\u2019m annoying\u2019 three times before they stopped. He squinted at the writing, and more he looked at it, the more worried he got. It looked an awful lot like Cyrus\u2019 handwriting. His y\u2019s were always curled at the bottom just so, his a\u2019s were never fully closed, and the way he drew his 2\u2019s were just like the ones on the page.</p><p>TJ felt his whole chest seize up. If Cyrus really did write this, which was becoming a much more real possibility with each passing moment, he couldn\u2019t help but feel like this was his fault. Did he really make Cyrus feel like this? Like he was basically worth nothing? Putting aside his worries, he ignored whatever his history teacher was saying, and pulled out another sheet of paper, keeping Cyrus\u2019 in his lap for reference. At least it looked like he was taking notes, since his teacher seemed to pay him no mind. And when the bell rang, he shoved both pieces of paper into his pocket and bolted out the door, looking for a certain boy.</p><hr><p>Last period didn\u2019t end fast enough, so when the bell finally did ring, Cyrus was the most excited that he\u2019d been all day. He still had homework he needed to catch up on, along with today\u2019s work, but all he wanted to do when he got home was to sleep more. He was almost out the door and ready to walk home, when he felt an urgent tapping on his shoulder. Turning around, he drew in a sharp breath. TJ.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d TJ mumbled, tapping his fingers nervously against his jeans.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want, TJ?\u201d Cyrus said. And it didn\u2019t come out mean, or cruel, or cold. It was just tired, like he was on his way to something.</p><p>\u201cThis is only going to take a few minutes, please,\u201d he practically begged, the urgency in his tone only growing. Being too tired to resist, Cyrus just shrugged, and TJ, wasting no more time, grabbed his wrist and dragged him towards an empty classroom, shutting the door behind him.</p><p>\u201cHurry up, I have things to do,\u201d Cyrus mumbled, taking a seat on the top of a desk.</p><p>TJ nodded, and shakily pulled out a piece of paper from his pocket. He felt like he was going to be sick, but he quickly handed it to Cyrus. When the other boy saw the paper, he immediately folded it back up, holding it close to his chest.</p><p>\u201cWh-where did you <i>find </i>this?\u201d Cyrus squeaked, his voice on the edge of cracking.</p><p>\u201cIt was on the floor by some of the lockers,\u201d he said softly, taking one of the chairs from under a desk and sitting in it, \u201cwhen?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus glanced up from his hands. \u201cWhen what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen did you write it?\u201d</p><p>He toyed with the idea of lying to him. How would he know? But after a few moments of thought, he felt like there was nothing left to lose.</p><p>\u201cThe other day,\u201d he admitted softly.</p><p>\u201cDo you <i>actually </i>believe all the things you wrote? Cyrus, those are all lies,\u201d TJ said firmly, scooting a little bit closer.</p><p>Cyrus shook his head, willing himself not to start crying, not here, and certainly not now. \u201cOf course they\u2019re true,\u201d he grumbled, \u201cwhy would you hate me if they\u2019re not?\u201d</p><p>TJ froze; if the rest of Cyrus\u2019 words were a slap to the face, this was a stab right through his heart. He literally could not speak for several moments after he\u2019d said that.</p><p>\u201cI\u2026you\u2026you think I <i>hate </i>you?\u201d He finally managed to say, his tongue feeling oddly dry.</p><p>Cyrus just shrugged again. \u201cI mean, you bailed that day,\u201d he said under his breath, kicking his legs underneath the desk.</p><p>TJ swore that if he wasn\u2019t sitting down he would have fainted. \u201cI\u2026I mean, I\u2019m really sorry for doing that, it was a crap move on my part, and there\u2019s a sort of reason why I did but\u2026I could never hate you, Cyrus, never.\u201d</p><p>When Cyrus didn\u2019t say anything, TJ pulled out the other piece of paper from his pocket, smoothing it out in front of him. \u201cI swear this won\u2019t take long, I\u2019m just asking you to hear me out,\u201d he looked up at Cyrus, who just motioned for him to hurry up.</p><p>TJ cleared his throat, tightly holding the piece of paper in his hand. \u201cYou\u2019re not annoying, not at all,\u201d he started, which barely garnered Cyrus\u2019 attention.</p><p>\u201cYou are strong,\u201d he continued.</p><p>\u201cWhat the heck is going on?\u201d</p><p>TJ put a hand up. \u201cJust listen. You\u2019re not helpless, if anything you\u2019re an independent person. You don\u2019t jump to conclusions too fast, if anything, you\u2019re good at reading people from a first glance,\u201d</p><p>Cyrus just furrowed his brows, listening to TJ talk. He glanced down at his list in his own hand, and it took him a few moments to realize that TJ was trying to counteract all the things that he\u2019d written on his own list.</p><p>\u201cBut I do get scared too easily,\u201d Cyrus mumbled, tracing his writing on the paper.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not a reason for anyone to hate you, Cyrus,\u201d TJ assured him, \u201cand\u2026you\u2019re not a bad judge of character, you\u2019re actually pretty good at it. Great, even.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPitiful,\u201d Cyrus countered, crossing his arms in defense.</p><p>\u201cLies,\u201d TJ cut him off before he could say more, \u201cyou\u2019re not pitiful. And getting too comfortable with people you barely know? More like you can make friends really easily.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but,\u201d Cyrus squints down at his own list, \u201cI\u2019m scared of stupid things.\u201d</p><p>TJ shook his head. \u201cNo, you\u2019re rational. You have rational fears,\u201d he says, looking at the next thing, \u201cand \u2018wanting things that you can\u2019t have\u2019? You have goals and dreams that you want to achieve. I have <i>no </i>idea how you thought that anyone could hate you because of that. Getting happy at dumb things? Seeing you smile is one of the best part of my days, and I don\u2019t even care what you smile about. It really doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><p>If Cyrus didn\u2019t know any better, he would have thought that he and TJ were back into their normal routine. He just looked at his list, and mumbled \u201cdork.\u201d</p><p>TJ\u2019s face grew harder by the moment, and he gripped the side of the chair with his free hand to try and keep his emotions at bay. \u201cYou are <i>not </i>a dork, Cyrus. And, for that matter, you\u2019re not clingy, you\u2019re not desperate, or a geek, or cringy. Not in the slightest.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus sighed. \u201cLook TJ, I appreciate what you\u2019re trying to do here, but you don\u2019t need to pity me like this.\u201d</p><p>His eyes widened, and for a second, nothing came out of his mouth except for a squeak. \u201cYou think this is pity? This isn\u2019t pity, I\u2019m just telling you the truth about yourself, because your mind seems to only think you\u2019re the worst. Which you\u2019re not, you\u2019re my favorite person.\u201d</p><p>TJ took a deep breath before continuing. \u201cPhysical strength? What\u2019s that got to do with someone hating you? You don\u2019t get disappointed easily, I know that for a fact, and,\u201d he pauses, hesitantly reaching up and placing a hand on Cyrus\u2019 shoulder, \u201cyou are <i>not </i>a burden. Please don\u2019t say that about yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut,\u201d he pauses, looking down at his paper, \u201cI am a bother, and nosy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not, not at all. And also, you are <i>extremely </i>helpful, Cyrus. You haven\u2019t helped just me, but so many people. You\u2019re a great friend, and all this nonsense of not being trustworthy or anything like that? It\u2019s a complete lie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven if I do try to help people, when they try and help me, I push them away,\u201d Cyrus said, glancing at TJ\u2019s hand, which was still on his shoulder. He didn\u2019t do anything to push him off, because honestly, the contact felt nice after a period of the cold shoulder.</p><p>\u201cAnd people should hate you for that? It\u2019s a coping mechanism, you should know that better than anyone,\u201d TJ informed him, \u201cand you are one of the smartest people I know, Cyrus. You\u2019re not stupid, or pathetic, where did you even get that idea?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I <i>do </i>waste people\u2019s time,\u201d he countered weakly, looking down at his lap.</p><p>TJ was so upset that Cyrus actually believed the things that he\u2019d written about him, that it just made him want to crumple right then and there. \u201cYou don\u2019t. You care so much about people, and you are always there when they need it. And you have annoying on here again, but that\u2019s not true.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus glances up at him when he says that. \u201cBut you said that I was.\u201d</p><p>TJ raised his brows. \u201cI\u2019d never say that. When did I say that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat day at the swings, after the whole Reed thing. You said that I was annoying. And judgy for that matter,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>TJ sighed, bowing his head. \u201cIt\u2026look, I\u2019m sorry for saying that, but in the heat of the moment, I was upset because\u2026I thought I was going to lose you. And I couldn\u2019t bear that.\u201d</p><p>The two of them were quiet for a little while, the only sound being the ticking clock up on the wall. Finally, TJ looked at the next things on the list, and felt like he was going to cry.</p><p>\u201cCyrus, look at me,\u201d he said firmly, meeting the other boy\u2019s gaze, \u201cI will never, and have never, hated you because of who you are. You being gay is just part of who you are, and is not a reason for me, or anyone else for that matter, to hate you,\u201d he pauses for a moment, \u201cespecially me. It\u2019d be pretty hypocritical.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus almost smiles at that. Almost. He instead just seems to relax, a breath passing through his lips. \u201cI\u2019m still weird though.\u201d</p><p>TJ just shrugged. \u201cWeird is good though. Why would anyone want to be normal?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus gave a weak smile at that, feeling a little lighter with each of TJ\u2019s words. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t change the fact that I\u2019m a bad dancer.\u201d</p><p>TJ crossed his arms. \u201cI\u2019ve seen you in the studio, Cyrus. You\u2019re not a bad dancer. You\u2019re always smiling, and you get this little smirk on your face when you\u2019re concentrating really hard. It\u2019s cute.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus ducked his head at that, and tried to tell his mind that he was still supposed to be mad at TJ, not fall for all his compliments. Before he could even say anything else, TJ beat him to it.</p><p>\u201cYou are worthy of everything, okay? You deserve the world. If anyone\u2019s a problem, it\u2019s me, not you. And you are certainly not a second best person. You\u2019re my first choice, always have been. The fact that you isolate people is, again, a coping mechanism for when you\u2019re upset. You\u2019re not a disaster, and never have been. And I hope this time you believe me when I say you\u2019re not annoying.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus nodded weakly; it felt really nice to hear someone tell him that he was their first choice. It was like he was wanted.</p><p>\u201cAnd\u2026don\u2019t say you\u2019re not attractive. You\u2019re\u2026\u201d he hesitates a little, barely able to look him in the eye, \u201cyou\u2019re beautiful, Cy, okay? All of you. Your smile, your laugh, your personality especially.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus opened his mouth to say something, but again, TJ beat him to it.</p><p>\u201cKira was going to out me if I didn\u2019t do the costume with her. I\u2019m sorry that I bailed and I\u2019m sorry that I didn\u2019t let you know, I was just so scared that she was going to tell people and I didn\u2019t-\u201d</p><p>\u201c-TJ, slow down,\u201d Cyrus cut him off, reaching out for his hand and giving it a soft squeeze, \u201cI forgive you, okay? And\u2026thank you for this. I feel a lot better now. And for the record,\u201d he laughs a little, \u201cI think you\u2019re pretty handsome yourself.\u201d</p><p>Now it was TJ\u2019s turn to try and hide his blush. He looked down at their hands, and couldn\u2019t help but smile. \u201cThanks,\u201d he mumbled bashfully, \u201cI try.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus smiled, hopping off of his desk and standing. \u201cI\u2019ve missed talking to you. What do you say we go get some ice cream and catch up?\u201d</p><p>TJ stood up with him. \u201cI\u2019d love that.\u201d</p><p>And after two rounds of ice cream and way more laughing and talking, they fell back into their normal rhythm, with a little more hand holding and hugging. But after today, their relationship was all the more stronger. When he went home that day, Cyrus through his list in the garbage, and pinned up TJ\u2019s list to the board in his room. Even when he was having a bad day, he could always look at that list and smile.</p>",

(inspired by <a href=\"https://theobligatedklutz.tumblr.com/post/183642133426/cyrus-sits-down-one-day-to-write-down-all-the\">this post)</a></p><p><b>ship: </b>tyrus</p><p><b>word count:</b> 9235 (she\u2019s a hefty one)</p><p><b>notes:</b> happy late birthday amanda! <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mqsacC6O0CwDxqCVXhKqKMg\">@swingsetboys</a> i hope you like this!<b><br><br></b><i>1. I\u2019m annoying</i></p><p>That one was a given, Cyrus thought. He always asked one too many questions, laughed a little too loud, and complained a little too often for people\u2019s likings. It only made sense that this was probably one of the main reasons that TJ probably hates him.</p><p>Hate. He doesn\u2019t like that word; it\u2019s so strong, it has so much power. Yet, it almost seems to fit the mood. After all, the costume was TJ\u2019s idea, not his. TJ was the one who looked so excited to do the costume based on an inside joke. And yet, TJ was the one who bailed on it. TJ was the one who did a costume with a girl he, supposedly, barely even knew.</p><p>He sighed, putting down his pen and leaning back in his chair. Maybe this didn\u2019t just start right around costume day. Maybe it went further back, but how far back? A week? A month? Cyrus shook his head, breathing out forcefully. Might as well start from the very beginning, he thought to himself.</p>[[MORE]]<p>The whole thing started with that damn muffin. The muffin, he pointedly thought, that he couldn\u2019t get for himself because he was too much of a coward to cut in line and get it for himself.</p><p><i>2. I\u2019m weak</i></p><p><i>3. I\u2019m helpless</i><br><br><i>Just like Jonah said</i>, he thought, but left that unwritten. He already knew that; he didn\u2019t want it written down.<br><br>That day with the stupid muffin seemed almost like a far away dream to him. He was almost certain that TJ\u2026smiled at him? It was kind of fuzzy; if you\u2019d asked him a week ago, he\u2019d be able to tell you how many steps TJ took towards him before saying \u2018he\u2019s with me\u2019. But now, he doubted that the whole exchange even happened. All he remembered was that he looked at TJ like this monster, like someone who could and would crush him underneath his sneaker. But\u2026he didn\u2019t. He was surprisingly friendly.<br></p><p><i>4. I jump to conclusions</i></p><p><i>5. I get scared too easily</i></p><p><i>6. I\u2019m a bad judge of character</i></p><p>For days after that, Cyrus had found himself lingering over their interaction, if you could even call it that. He\u2019d absentmindedly draw a muffin on his biology notes. At lunch, he\u2019d stare at his mashed potatoes so long that Buffy had to physically prod him to make him eat. And when his parents drove him home from school, the car ride was remarkably quiet.</p><p>He really thought that that would have been the first and last time that him and TJ interacted. He was <i>fairly </i>certain that was the taller boy\u2019s name; Buffy had mentioned her disgust for him several times before. But their conversation had only just begun.</p><p>A little while later, Cyrus had found himself drenched in sweat from head to toe because oh his goodness, he couldn\u2019t stop himself from getting tongue-tied in front of the camera. And it certainly didn\u2019t help that he was with his, now-ex, crush. That only made him want to do well <i>more</i>, which of course led to a disastrous outcome. He\u2019d ended up running towards the swings to try and calm down. He\u2019d even sung that stupid song he made up in elementary school.</p><p>And then, seemingly out of nowhere, TJ popped behind him, with a compliment for his song. And Cyrus\u2026well, Cyrus just looked scared. He probably looked like a deer in the headlights from TJ\u2019s perspective. And then of course, TJ had made some joke about what he sang on the slide. Probably in a pitiful attempt to make conversation</p><p><i>7. I\u2019m pitiful</i></p><p>Somehow he\u2019d managed to convince TJ to sit and swing with him. <i>With him</i>. It felt almost natural, them sitting together on the swings. Well, not together per se, but they were on the same swing set. Separately.</p><p><i>\u2018You don\u2019t know me. I got stuff.\u2019</i></p><p>He\u2019d never forgotten those words, because in that moment, he felt almost comfortable around TJ. Like he just wanted to spill everything and get everything off his chest.</p><p><i>8. I get too comfortable with people I barely know</i></p><p>They\u2019d barely even talked that day. All that Cyrus had learned was that, apparently, TJ had things that he needed to feel better about, which to Cyrus, sounded absolutely absurd. He was the captain of the basketball team, people were borderline terrified of him, and let\u2019s be honest, he wasn\u2019t ugly. Far from it, actually, save for the insane amount of hair gel he used to wear.</p><p>And when he gave him an underdog, he barely remembered feeling so light and so effortless all at once. It felt like he was on top of the world, and that nothing could touch him. And the smile on TJ\u2019s face when he was squealing like mad\u2026it was nice to see. Even then, Cyrus could tell he didn\u2019t smile like that, or maybe even at all, much.</p><p><i>9. I\u2019m scared of stupid things</i></p><p>And then Buffy had shown up and TJ instantly put up his walls again and wanted to hurry off. And for some weird reason, Cyrus didn\u2019t want him to leave. He wanted his new\u2026friend? (if he could call him that) to make sure that he knew that Buffy was cool, and understanding when she wanted to be.</p><p><i>10. I want things that I can\u2019t have</i></p><p><i>\u2018Thanks for reminding me about swinging. That helped.\u2019</i></p><p>For once that day, he felt useful, like he\u2019d been successful in making someone just a little bit happier. He\u2019d gone home that day feeling pretty good about himself. Even his parents seemed to notice his good mood, but when they asked him about it, he just shrugged it off, saying that he\u2019d found a few dollars on his way in to school. He was fairly certain they didn\u2019t believe him, but they didn\u2019t pry anymore, simply letting them eat his dinner in peace.</p><p><i>11. I get happy at dumb things</i></p><p>A few days after their encounter at the swings, TJ somehow managed to find Cyrus again in the hallway. He looked oddly stressed, and he didn\u2019t have the same easygoing \u2018shrug it off\u2019 demeanor that he\u2019d sported just a few days ago. He looked like he wanted to say something, Cyrus could tell by the way he\u2019d carried himself. He hadn\u2019t forgotten their conversation from that day.</p><p><i>\u201cSomething on your mind?\u201d Cyrus had asked, rocking back on his heels.</i></p><p><i>TJ had just shrugged, tugging on his hoodie straps. \u201cJust\u2026stuff,\u201d he\u2019d said lamely, but Cyrus could see behind his indifferent demeanor.</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to tell me now, or ever,\u201d Cyrus had assured him, and was ready to walk off when TJ started pulling something out of his back pocket.</i></p><p><i>\u201cHere,\u201d he mumbled, handing Cyrus his phone, \u201cput your number in and I\u2019ll\u2026tell you about it sometime, I guess,\u201d</i></p><p><i>Cyrus had nearly dropped the boy\u2019s phone from pure shock. TJ was asking for his number? Well, no. More like TJ didn\u2019t want to talk right now and instead wanted a second method of communication.</i></p><p><i>\u201cO-Okay,\u201d Cyrus had stammered out, putting his phone number in, all the while thinking about what he would write for his contact name. He wanted to make it something a little creative, but not something so stupid that it was embarrassing.</i></p><p><i>\u2018Cyrus (Underdog)\u2019 he typed out, before handing it back to TJ. He had glanced down at his phone, and Cyrus had sworn he saw the ghost of a smile.</i></p><p><i>\u201cCool, I\u2019ll text you,\u201d he\u2019d said, before running up to catch up with his basketball friends.</i></p><p><i>He\u2019d waited all weekend for TJ to text him, but he never had. He\u2019d even sent him a text himself.</i></p><p><i>[Cyrus: hey it\u2019s cyrus! but you probably know that, anyways i\u2019m here to listen if you ever want to talk :)]</i></p><p><i>He regretted it the moment he\u2019d sent it.</i></p><p><i>12. I\u2019m a dork</i></p><p><i>13. I\u2019m clingy</i></p><p>When it had come time to invite people to his bar mitzvah, the last invitation was almost shaking in his hand. Why he was so nervous to hand it to TJ was beyond him, but looking back, a crush was definitely forming. Hindsight truly was a savior. He really, <i>really </i>wanted TJ to come, so much that he probably sounded desperate when he asked.</p><p><i>14. I\u2019m desperate</i></p><p><i>15. I\u2019m a geek</i></p><p>Luckily for him, TJ had accepted; heck, he\u2019d even smiled at him. And then, he launched into a conversation about Buffy. Something about needing her to do something for him. And there it was, he thought, the reason that TJ had even talked to him at all. He need a favor. What? A date? Her number? TJ had ended up being pretty vague about the whole ordeal.</p><p><i>\u201cJust use her two favorite words,\u201d Cyrus had said confidently.</i></p><p><i>\u201cI\u2019m sorry?\u201d</i></p><p><i>He\u2019d paled, eyes bugging out of his head. \u201cNo, she hates those words,\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cThen what?\u201d</i></p><p><i>Cyrus had hesitated. On the one hand, he did want to keep talking to TJ. On the other hand, he didn\u2019t want to say something he shouldn\u2019t. But one look up to him, seeing him almost smiling, he nodding up the sidewalk.</i></p><p><i>\u201cCome with me. You might not like saying this, but Buffy will love hearing it.\u201d The two of them had walked out towards the bus stop at the front of the school. After checking to see if the coast was clear, no Buffy in sight, Cyrus had stepped in front of TJ.</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d he\u2019d said.</i></p><p><i>TJ furrowed his brows in confusion. \u201cAbout what?\u201d</i></p><p><i>Cyrus shook his head. \u201cNo, those are her favorite words. \u2018You\u2019re right\u2019. I don\u2019t know what it is about them, but she just\u2026seems to cave at whatever when you say them. It\u2019s how I got her to sell me Tokyo,\u201d</i></p><p><i>TJ looked at him, even more confused than before, but there was an air of fondness in his gaze.</i></p><p><i>Cyrus waved him off. \u201cMonopoly. Long story.\u201d</i></p><p><i>TJ nodded curtly, upon hearing the bus beep. \u201cMaybe you could tell me sometime,\u201d he offered, shaking his phone, \u201cyou can use emojis and everything,\u201d he\u2019d joked, before waving and heading onto the bus.</i></p><p><i>Cyrus couldn\u2019t wipe that stupid smile off of his face no matter how hard he tried.</i></p><p><i>Sure enough, when he got home that night, he sent TJ a long text explaining how he just needed Tokyo to complete his collection, but Buffy wouldn\u2019t sell it to him. He didn\u2019t really remember what had happened, other than the fact that he\u2019d said \u2018you\u2019re right\u2019 so many times it started to sound like a foreign language.</i></p><p><i>And this time, TJ did send him a text back</i></p><p><i>[TJ \ud83c\udfc0: lol that\u2019s funny. i\u2019ll remember that. thanks for today]</i></p><p>Cyrus almost smiled as he added new things to the list. Memories of his bar mitzvah were fond, and he wishes times could be as simple as they were back then. He hadn\u2019t seen TJ that much, save for the time that he couldn\u2019t open a damn bottle.</p><p><i>\u201cHey, Underdog!\u201d TJ had said above the music, approaching him.</i></p><p><i>Cyrus had just groaned in response, his shoulders slumping, He set the bottle back down on the table and swiped at his hairline. \u201cHey, TJ,\u201d</i></p><p><i>TJ had looked between Cyrus and the bottle. \u201cNeed some help?\u201d</i></p><p><i>Cyrus shook his head. \u201cNo, I\u2019m supposed to do this myself, you know. Be a man and all that jazz,\u201d he chuckles, cringing inwardly.</i></p><p><i>16. I\u2019m cringy</i></p><p><i>17. I have no physical strength</i></p><p><i>TJ nodded, putting his hands in his pocket, before he\u2019d stepped forward and grabbed the bottle. Cyrus had started to panic a little, but TJ assured him things would be fine. He\u2019d started to open the bottle, just a little, and then had quickly handed it over to Cyrus to finish it off.</i></p><p><i>\u201cAll yours, dude,\u201d he whispered, discreetly shuffling back towards the dance floor. Cyrus had stood stunned for a few moments, before he came to his senses and opened the bottle the rest of the way. It made a satisfying \u2018pop!\u2019 and the foam spilled over the neck. All of his family and friends were clapping, and if he squinted, he could see TJ, clapping his hands and smiling.</i></p><p>Things seemed near perfect that day. He hadn\u2019t seen TJ for the rest of the party, but he assumed that he was enjoying himself. At the end of the day, when he was all dressed up in his dino pajamas, he heard his phone ding.</p><p><i>[TJ \ud83c\udfc0: hey that fortune teller at your party, is she for real?]</i></p><p><i>He had swore he was having some weird form of deja vu; what he said sounded just like what Buffy had said back at the party.</i></p><p><i>[Cyrus: no, she\u2019s fake, she just likes to pretend she can see the future. why?]</i></p><p><i>[TJ \ud83c\udfc0: oh, she just said some pretty freaky stuff, like she was for real]</i></p><p><i>[Cyrus: rest assured, she cannot see the future]</i></p><p><i>[TJ \ud83c\udfc0: thank god]</i></p><p><i>[Cyrus: i, however, can. and i see you and me tomorrow at the spoon for taters]</i></p><p><i>[TJ \ud83c\udfc0: can you now? i\u2019d love to but i have practice, sorry, maybe another time]</i></p><p><i>[Cyrus: yeah totally!!]</i></p><p><i>Cyrus had really hoped those exclamation points could mask his disappointment.</i></p><p><i>18. I get disappointed easily</i></p><p><i>19. I\u2019m a burden</i></p><p>Had he already written that? He didn\u2019t know, and he frankly didn\u2019t care. If he wrote it twice, maybe it was really true.</p><p>After his bar mitzvah, things seemed to be pretty at bay. Buffy was playing well on the basketball team. Life with Andi seemed less dramatic than usual, and everyone seemed to be getting alone pretty well. That was, until he went to one of the basketball games and found TJ glaring at the court, not dressed in his uniform. He\u2019d went over to check on him, but TJ had just brushed him off.</p><p><i>20. I\u2019m a bother</i></p><p><i>21. I\u2019m nosy</i></p><p><i>\u201cEating your feelings? I do that,\u201d he\u2019d tried to lighten the mood with a joke, but TJ\u2019s face was a palette of annoyed and frustrated. The two of them had sat down at the table in the room adjacent to the court.</i></p><p><i>\u201cThink they\u2019ll win without me?\u201d TJ had asked, his mind seeming to be anywhere else but in this conversation. It was weird not seeing him on the court, Cyrus agreed.</i></p><p><i>\u201cI don\u2019t even know who they\u2019re playing,\u201d he\u2019d admitted with a shrug.</i></p><p><i>\u201cThe Raptors,\u201d TJ had sighed, \u201cI should be in that game.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you?\u201d Cyrus had asked. Way to be direct, kid.</i></p><p><i>TJ grumbled. \u201c\u2018Cause\u2026I\u2019m failing math. They won\u2019t let me play basketball because I can\u2019t do some stupid equations. How are those things even related?\u201d</i></p><p><i>Cyrus had started putting pieces together, but he didn\u2019t want to pry. He didn\u2019t want to ruin the delicate friendship between him and TJ. \u201cMaybe you should get a different tutor,\u201d he\u2019d suggested.</i></p><p><i>TJ had just brushed him off. \u201cWhat I need is a different\u2026brain.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Cyrus had frowned, his brows knitting into confusion. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with yours?\u201d</i></p><p><i>For the first time that day, TJ looked almost hesitant. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t work. There\u2019s a malfunction.\u201d</i></p><p><i>That was one way to put it, Cyrus had thought.</i></p><p><i>\u201cI might have this\u2026math dyslexia,\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cDyscalculia,\u201d Cyrus had said, not missing a beat.</i></p><p><i>\u201cBuffy\u2019s the one who figured it out. She\u2019s been bugging me to talk to Coleman. Constantly on my back about it,\u201d TJ had sounded exasperated.</i></p><p><i>\u201cIt\u2019s pretty common. Not worth replacing your brain over,\u201d Cyrus had assured him, the beginnings of a smile starting to form.</i></p><p><i>TJ rolled his eyes. \u201cDude, it\u2019s a-\u201d he was cut off by a few people entering the room, and he clammed up immediately, waiting for them to leave. When he was certain they were out of earshot, he\u2019d continued.</i></p><p><i>\u201c\u2026learning disability. I don\u2019t wanna go around announcing that,\u201d</i></p><p><i>Cyrus had felt awful; TJ didn\u2019t deserve to feel like this. \u201cDude, that\u2019s an overused buzzword. There is nothing wrong with you.\u201d</i></p><p><i>TJ seemed to almost stop frowning at that. Cyrus couldn\u2019t back it up with evidence, he had just said it.</i></p><p><i>\u201cAnd, your teacher can\u2019t fail you for having it.\u201d Of course he couldn\u2019t. He just regurgitated facts.</i></p><p><i>22. I\u2019m not helpful</i></p><p><i>\u201cColeman can\u2019t fail me,\u201d TJ had repeated, the words tasting almost strange in his mouth.</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou could be playing basketball. Right now.\u201d</i></p><p><i>TJ had groaned, leaning back in his chair. \u201cAnd Buffy\u2019s been right all along,\u201d he\u2019d mumbled, almost chuckling to himself, \u201cAt least this time I\u2019ll mean it when I tell her she\u2019s right. That really is her favorite thing to hear.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Cyrus had cringed internally. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have told you about that. She\u2019d kill me if she ever found out.\u201d</i></p><p><i>TJ had scoffed at that, shaking his head. \u201cAh, don\u2019t worry. She won\u2019t find out,\u201d he had paused for a moment, \u201cand she may have been right, but you\u2019re the one who really helped me.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Cyrus hadn\u2019t known what to say at that. He felt oddly proud of himself, and seeing TJ smile a little just made the whole moment better.</i></p><p><i>\u201cCheese puff?\u201d TJ had offered.</i></p><p><i>Cyrus shrugged. \u201cSure.\u201d</i></p><p>That day had been a good one, Cyrus had concluded. TJ had found him helpful, which almost made him want to erase the previous thing he\u2019d written. But, he figured, he\u2019d end up rewriting it anyways later, so why change it now.</p><p>Besides, what had happened later with Buffy only made him wince. How could he have been so careless as to tell TJ his best friend\u2019s weakness?</p><p><i>23. I\u2019m a bad friend</i></p><p><i>24. I\u2019m not trustworthy</i></p><p><i>25. I\u2019m a backstabber</i></p><p><i>26. I can\u2019t keep a secret</i></p><p><i>27. I\u2019m a liar</i></p><p><i>\u2018He wants to be friends with me. Who knows why?\u2019</i></p><p>He still thought about that sometimes. Why <i>did </i>TJ want to be friends with him? Not for his terrible humor, or for his nerdy jokes, that was for sure. TJ did seem to take pity on him after Buffy left.</p><p><i>\u201cCyrus, hey!\u201d TJ had called out, jogging up to Cyrus\u2019 locker, only to find him staring into the void. \u00a0He had waved his hand in front of his face. \u201cEarth to Cyrus?\u201d</i></p><p><i>Cyrus had flinched, nearly hitting his head on his own locker. \u201cHuh? Oh, hey TJ.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cSomething on your mind?\u201d</i></p><p><i>Pity. Pity was all that his mind could chant at him, but somehow, he still ended up talking. \u201cI miss Buffy,\u201d he muttered, closing his eyes. It was only his first day back at school, and he was already miserable.</i></p><p><i>TJ had slung his arm across his shoulder, tugging him down the hallway towards the cafeteria. \u201cI know you do. But hey, she\u2019s just a call or a text away right?\u201d</i></p><p><i>Cyrus just shrugged, keeping his gaze down. \u201cI guess so,\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cDo you wanna sit with me and my friends at lunch?\u201d TJ had offered.</i></p><p><i>Cyrus shook his head. \u201cNo, I\u2019m okay. Thank you though, really. I\u2019ll see you around.\u201d</i></p><p><i>28. I push people away when they just want to help</i></p><p>Cyrus seemed to be pretty good at pushing people away. No matter how much he\u2019d isolated himself from people, especially when Buffy was away, they still managed to make an effort to sneak back into his life. Well, less <i>people </i>and more <i>TJ</i>. He\u2019d even apologized to a piece of metal in order to sit down with him and Andi. And then of course, in typical Cyrus fashion, he just let his emotions flow and texted him his list of things he couldn\u2019t do.</p><p><i>29. I\u2019m pathetic</i></p><p>He\u2019d even taken time out of his day to, first of all, drag him out of the drama between Andi and Jonah, and second of all, to teach him how to do a somersault. He didn\u2019t forget how his heart fluttered after they chest bumped. It felt like it did around Jonah\u2026well, <i>used </i>to feel around Jonah.</p><p>Even when Buffy had said that his disappeared, he had lied slightly. At this point, he didn\u2019t want to admit that his crush didn\u2019t \u201cdisappear\u201d, but it\u2026moved, almost. It was like all his feelings transferred to TJ; the sweaty palms, the fluttering heart, and the indescribable desire to spend more time around him, preferably alone. Time spent alone with TJ was some of the best time of his life.</p><p><i>\u201cOkay, so go over this one more time?\u201d TJ had sighed, swirling his straw in his milkshake.</i></p><p><i>\u201cSo,\u201d Cyrus started, clearing his throat, \u201cI\u2019ll find a way to get Buffy to the basketball courts, and then you show up, I\u2019ll disappear, then you two can talk for a little, I\u2019ll come back and then you guys will play some one on one,\u201d</i></p><p><i>TJ had chuckled, leaning back in the booth. \u201cWow, you\u2019ve really thought about this, huh?\u201d</i></p><p><i>Cyrus was probably blushing now, and he tried to hide it by shrugging and sipping his milkshake. \u201cJust a little bit,\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cWell, it\u2019s a pretty good idea. You\u2019re full of them.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Cyrus was now for sure blushing. \u201cEh, I try.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou succeed.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Why did he have to say these things? It only made Cyrus more and more and more flustered.</i></p><p>That day was one of his fondest memories with TJ. It was also probably when he realized how intense his crush really was. And when the day came for the basketball game, it was a little shaky, but it had worked out. Heck, TJ had even performed an apology rap for Buffy.</p><p><i>\u2018I\u2019m so confused.\u2019</i></p><p>So was Cyrus that day. He didn\u2019t know why TJ had even agreed to go through all this effort just to apologize for Buffy. Maybe it\u2019d be nice to befriend someone he liked, Cyrus thought. After all, that\u2019s how it went for him and Jonah, but at least that crush was in the past.</p><p><i>30. I\u2019m stupid</i></p><p>After Buffy had decided to start her basketball team, she had enlisted in Cyrus, and Andi a little, to help put up posters. Andi made them, Cyrus had to hang them. TJ had even offered to help him do that.</p><p><i>\u201cNeed some help down there?\u201d TJ\u2019s voice had floated down the hallway, a stupid grin on his face.</i></p><p><i>Cyrus had jumped one last time to try and pin the poster up, but to no avail. \u201cIs it that obvious?\u201d</i></p><p><i>TJ had chuckled at that, plucking the poster from his hands. \u201cHuh. \u2018Girls Basketball Tryouts This Week\u2019. You trying out for the team, Underdog?\u201d</i></p><p><i>Cyrus huffed at that, crossing his arms. \u201cNo. I\u2019m just on poster-hanging duty. Which I seem to be failing at.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cHere, I\u2019ll help you,\u201d he\u2019d offered, handing the poster back to Cyrus.</i></p><p><i>Cyrus scowled, looking between the poster and TJ. \u201cI told you that I couldn\u2019t reach the-hey!\u201d</i></p><p><i>And before Cyrus knew it his feet weren\u2019t on the ground anymore. TJ had a firm grip on him, and Cyrus was just squirming.</i></p><p><i>\u201cI could do it for you but, teach a man to fish?\u201d he had repeated his mantra from when they first met each other.</i></p><p><i>\u201cTJ, put me down!\u201d Cyrus giggled, his legs kicking in the air.</i></p><p><i>TJ eventually gave in, putting him down, smiling widely. \u201cFine, fine, I\u2019ll help put them up. The normal way.\u201d</i></p><p>It had taken them way longer than expected to put up the posters, probably because they were just a chaotic duo, but Cyrus wouldn\u2019t have had it any other way. It was way more fun than expected, even if it took a long time.</p><p><i>31. I waste people\u2019s time</i></p><p>TJ was always one to push him out of his comfort zone, literally and figuratively. The day they went dirt biking was probably the epitome of that fact. The day was supposed to be a great one, seeing as he finally was getting around to meeting TJ\u2019s friends. But things turned sour once Reed had shown him the gun. And when he confronted TJ about it, he barely said anything. Worse, he didn\u2019t leave either. He was so concerned with his safety, as well as TJ\u2019s, but still managed to walk off without him.</p><p><i>32. I\u2019m careless</i></p><p>And then <i>worse</i>, he thought, was when he went to talk to Metcalf and the police about the gun. He felt so panicked the whole day after that encounter that he couldn\u2019t even eat lunch. And considering he wasn\u2019t allowed to talk to TJ all day, thanks to his friends, it felt worse. Don\u2019t get him wrong, he appreciated what Buffy and Andi did for him, but he really wanted to clear things up with TJ. When they talked it out on the swings, he had no idea why he said the things he did.</p><p><i>\u201cYou can be a little annoying, you know that?\u201d TJ had said, taking a step towards him.</i></p><p><i>33. I\u2019m annoying</i></p><p><i>\u201cWell, you can be oblivious,\u201d Cyrus had countered weakly. He didn\u2019t even know where the word oblivious came from. Oblivious to what? To the fact that sitting there with Reed was putting him in obvious danger? Or to the fact that Cyrus had an undeniable crush on him?</i></p><p><i>\u201cWell you can be very judgy,\u201d TJ had remarked, taking another step forward.</i></p><p><i>34. I\u2019m judgy</i></p><p><i>\u201cWell you can be intimidating,\u201d Cyrus had replied, and was surprised his voice wasn\u2019t wobbling.</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou know what else you are?\u201d</i></p><p><i>That sounded like a threat. TJ could fill it in with any word in the world. Nosy. Irritating. Not my friend. He had told himself to keep his composure.</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhat?\u201d How he had managed to say that without his voice breaking was beyond him.</i></p><p><i>\u201cThe only person I can talk to like this,\u201d he had said softer. Cyrus thought he was going to faint; he said what? He couldn\u2019t help but smile at that.</i></p><p>That day seemed like light years away now, so far that it was nothing but a mere memory. He almost wishes he was back on the swingset with TJ, just swinging mindlessly. Or maybe he wants to go back to playing ping-pong with him and Jonah after they\u2019d resolved their issues. It had been a bit of a stressful day for the most part, but seeing Jonah and TJ make up made it all worth it. Although, when they were talking about \u2018stuff\u2019 they had to do with, Cyrus had chickened out and said something about flamingos. He barely remembered, but he knew it was a lie. They\u2019d played a few more round until Jonah decided to head over to the Red Rooster with Andi, leaving him and TJ.</p><p><i>\u201cSo, flamingos, huh?\u201d TJ had chuckled, picking up the ping-pong balls that remained on the floor.</i></p><p><i>Cyrus had just shrugged, trying to ignore the fact that his heart was hammering in his chest: a clear sign that he was lying. Couple that with feeling like he couldn\u2019t swallow, and you had a recipe for disaster.</i></p><p><i>\u201cYup,\u201d he squeaked, putting the paddles on top of each other, \u201creal and plastic,\u201d</i></p><p><i>TJ had just hummed in response, leaning against the table. \u201cSo when we went to the zoo that time and you were spitting out facts about why flamingos are pink, while you pointed at them\u2026your fear just happened to disappear then?\u201d</i></p><p><i>Cyrus gulped, trailing his finger around the rim of the paddles. \u201cThat\u2026that\u2019s the day it started?\u201d he\u2019s said, but it sounded like a question.</i></p><p><i>TJ\u2019s expression had softened, and he\u2019d come up to Cyrus, putting his hand on his shoulder. \u201cStuff?\u201d</i></p><p><i>Cyrus nodded weakly in response. \u201cYeah, stuff,\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cSwings?\u201d TJ had offered.</i></p><p><i>Cyrus shook his head, nodding over to the stairs. \u201cStairs,\u201d he\u2019d mumbled, going and taking a seat on the second to the last stair. TJ had sat down beside him, and he didn\u2019t push him to talk. He knew Cyrus would talk when he was good and ready.</i></p><p><i>\u201cLook,\u201d he started, \u201cthis\u2026this is something that I think about a lot, you know? It\u2019s not\u2026something I\u2019m ashamed of, I just don\u2019t tell people that I don\u2019t trust,\u201d he admitted.</i></p><p><i>\u201cUnless you killed someone I swear I\u2019ll keep whatever you tell me a secret,\u201d TJ had promised, crossing his heart, \u201cand even then, I\u2019d help you hide the body.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Cyrus breathed out a laugh at that. \u201cNo, it\u2019s not that it\u2019s\u2026I don\u2019t like girls,\u201d he said lamely, waving his hands in the air a little, \u201cI mean, I-I like guys. Like, in a romantic way,\u201d</i></p><p><i>TJ had remained quiet for a moment, waiting to see if Cyrus had anything else to say, but when he didn\u2019t he just nudged him lightly. \u201cI\u2019m glad you told me. It was brave,\u201d he paused, looking up to face him, \u201cyou\u2019re brave, Cyrus. Braver than you give yourself credit for,\u201d</i></p><p><i>Cyrus had smiled softly, breathing out and feeling like the oxygen was actually getting to his lungs. \u201cSo\u2026we\u2019re still cool? You and me?\u201d</i></p><p><i>TJ had scoffed, nudging him once more. \u201cOf course we are! It\u2019ll take a lot more than this for things to be not cool between us.\u201d</i></p><p>He kept thinking about that day; what if it wasn\u2019t the best time to come out to TJ? What if he actually did think it was weird and was just trying to keep the situation as light as possible? All these what ifs, Cyrus concluded, could be boiled down.</p><p><i>35. I\u2019m gay</i></p><p>He sighed, staring at that statement for a while. It was true, but the idea that TJ could hate him for something he couldn\u2019t control\u2026it hurt a lot. Almost too much, but he had to write down <i>every </i>possibility, <i>every </i>possible thing.</p><p><i>36. I\u2019m weird</i></p><p>That one was a little more general, he supposed. Weird could cover a lot of things, not just being who he was, but all his nerdy hyperfixations, the way he acted around people, and his choice to never really go out with friends to parties. Too many reasons to list, so it was all boiled down to one word.</p><p>One word. That seemed to be all TJ could say after his dance recital that one weekend.</p><p><i>He\u2019d finished the routine and was in the locker room wrapping up and putting his things into his duffel bag when they door swung open. TJ was walking his way, a hand behind his back.</i></p><p><i>\u201cWow,\u201d he\u2019d said, a gentle smile on his face.</i></p><p><i>Cyrus waited for him to say more, even along the lines of how ridiculous he\u2019d looked on stage, flopping around like boiled pasta, but he didn\u2019t say anything else.</i></p><p><i>\u201cWow? That\u2019s it?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cWow, wow,\u201d he repeated, pulling out a small dandelion from behind his back and handing it to Cyrus with a sheepish smile on his face, \u201c\u2026wow,\u201d</i></p><p><i>Cyrus had accepted the flower graciously, and TJ had said something about catching up with his sister before he left for practice.</i></p><p><i>37. I\u2019m a bad dancer</i></p><p>TJ somehow knew that dandelions were Cyrus\u2019 favorite, probably from the numerous times he\u2019d said that. He always knew just what to bring to every event, even to his Bubbe Rose\u2019 shiva. How did he know to bring challah bread?</p><p><i>\u201cHey, Cyrus,\u201d TJ had caught him alone, after the others had left and his family was cleaning dishes up and packing away food.</i></p><p><i>\u201cTJ, hi,\u201d he\u2019d returned with a small smile, stacking one plate on top of another, \u201cyou know we\u2019re wrapping up and all, you can go home,\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI know,\u201d he\u2019d said, putting his hands in his pockets, \u201cI just wanted to say that\u2026I\u2019m sorry for your loss. I know that she was really important to you, and I don\u2019t know how much it\u2019s going to mean coming from me, but\u2026she cares about you a lot. We all do,\u201d he\u2019d gestured vaguely to the people around the room.</i></p><p><i>Cyrus had felt like crying right then and there, but he didn\u2019t, somehow. He just smiled wider than before. \u201cThat does mean a lot, thank you, really. I know she does, I just\u2026I miss her a lot already,\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI know, and\u2026if you ever want to talk about anything, tell me stories about her, or you just want me to distract you from this with a basketball story, I\u2019m there.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cThank you, TJ. That means a lot.\u201d</i></p><p>How had things managed to go from almost perfect, to the disastrous state that they were in now? He wanted to say that he didn\u2019t understand, but he did. He knew that it had to do with himself, because that always seemed to be the problem. <i>He </i>always seemed to be the problem. The things he wrote just started to spill out of him.</p><p><i>38. I\u2019m not worthy</i></p><p><i>39. I\u2019m always the problem</i></p><p><i>40. I\u2019m there when I\u2019m not wanted</i></p><p><i>41. I\u2019m a second-best person</i></p><p><i>42. I\u2019m not attractive</i></p><p><i>43. I isolate myself from people</i></p><p><i>44. I\u2019m a disaster</i></p><p><i>45. I\u2019m annoying</i></p><p>He stopped writing for a second; the last words he\u2019d written looked familiar. He scanned over the list and found that he\u2019d written \u2018I\u2019m annoying\u2019 three times. Sighing, he set the pen down and closed his eyes. Annoying. He\u2019d written it so many times, that was probably the main reason, he deducted. With a shaky hand, he folded up the paper and shoved it into a backpack pocket of his. He didn\u2019t feel particularly upset, he just felt numb, and a little tired. He managed to trudge down the stairs, where his mom was sitting and cutting up some vegetables for tonight\u2019s dinner.</p><p>\u201cCyrus, sweetie, how are you feeling?\u201d she asked sweetly, wiping her hands on the towel.</p><p>He just shrugged, unable to maintain eye contact for longer than a second. \u201cNot\u2026great. Is it okay if I stay home from school tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>She softened at that, coming over to him and giving his shoulder a light squeeze. \u201cI know you\u2019re upset, but avoiding-\u201d</p><p>\u201c-just one day, please mom. I swear I\u2019ll go back the day after. I promise. I just need tomorrow,\u201d he pleaded, looking up at her, eyes filled with a layer of unshed tears.</p><p>She looked over his facial features for a few seconds before her shoulders relaxed, and she nodded weakly. \u201cOkay, you have tomorrow, okay? Do whatever you need to do and if you want to be alone, that\u2019s fine. If you need someone to talk to-\u201d</p><p>\u201c-I can call another therapist,\u201d Cyrus half-joked, offering a tiny smile, \u201cthanks, mom. I\u2019ll be in my room for a little while. Think I\u2019ll just take a nap.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, watching him worriedly as he walked up the stairs and quietly shut the door to his room with a gentle click. He collapsed onto his bed, and he lied there forever until he felt like he couldn\u2019t breathe through his nose. When did he start crying? Cyrus didn\u2019t even know the answer to that simple question, and he was too weary to think about it. He pulled the covers over his head, closed his eyes, and waited for all the thoughts swirling around his head to settle down, before he finally fell asleep.</p><hr><p>The next time Cyrus woke up, it was pretty dark outside, and he squinted at his alarm clock. It was close to eleven thirty, and he just sighed, grabbing his phone off of his stand and opened it to check through his notifications.. A few texts from Andi and Buffy in their group chat, one from Amber about dance, and none from TJ.</p><p><b>[buffy: hey cy are you okay?]</b></p><p><b>[andi: yeah, we\u2019re worried. but we\u2019ll talk to you tomorrow]</b></p><p><b>[cyrus: i\u2019m not going tomorrow, i don\u2019t feel well]</b></p><p><b>[andi: are you okay? do you need soup or something?]</b></p><p><b>[buffy: yeah do you need us to come over?]</b></p><p><b>[cyrus: no that\u2019s fine, it\u2019s not that bad, but i did manage to convince my mom to let me stay home]</b></p><p><b>[buffy: the talented actor mr cyrus goodman]</b></p><p><b>[cyrus: i\u2019m not lying, it\u2019s the truth, it\u2019s just not the worst pain i could be in]</b></p><p><b>[andi: well if you need anything, just text us]</b></p><p><b>[cyrus: i will, i love you guys]</b></p><p><b>[buffy: we love you too!]</b></p><p><b>[andi: &lt;3]</b></p><p>Cyrus felt drained just from that short conversation, and he put his phone aside, staring up at the ceiling. It irked him that TJ hadn\u2019t sent him a text, especially after what had happened. If he wanted to apologize, which maybe he didn\u2019t, a text would have been a start, because on Costume Day, there was nothing more than a few \u2018I\u2019m sorrys\u2019 and \u2018I should have called\u2019. It wasn\u2019t enough, not in the slightest, but as the days went on, desperation started to seep in, and Cyrus tried to convince himself that it was enough of an apology for him to just forget all of this happened. But no matter how many times he said that to himself in the mirror, he never could actually, genuinely believe himself. After a little more thinking about the matter, he pulled the covers back over his head, and fell asleep again.</p><hr><p>\u201cC\u2019mon, c\u2019mon,\u201d TJ muttered under his breath, scanning through the hallway to try and find a certain brown-eyed boy walking through the hallways. But the more time that passed, the more his hope drained, and he retreated to his locker. Thankfully, he saw Buffy and Andi walking together, and nearly pushed people over to talk to them.</p><p>\u201cHave you guys seen Cyrus today?\u201d He asked, nearly out of breath, and looking mildly disheveled.</p><p>The two girls exchanged looks, not really wanting to talk to TJ at the moment, but they just gave him cold gazes. \u201cHe\u2019s sick,\u201d Buffy said simply.</p><p>\u201cWait, what? It\u2019s, like, basically summer,\u201d TJ sputtered, rubbing the back of his neck.</p><p>Andi shrugged. \u201cAll I know is that he said he felt too tired and too weak to come to school today. Should be back tomorrow,\u201d she said curtly, pivoting on her foot and heading to her next class, Buffy following close behind.</p><p>TJ just stood in the middle of the hallway, dumbfounded. Cyrus wasn\u2019t in school today, and he couldn\u2019t help but feel like it was his fault. Tired and weak, they\u2019d said. That didn\u2019t sound like a typical cold, and he tried not to jump to the worst possible conclusion, but his mind didn\u2019t allow him to do that. Cyrus was home because he wanted to avoid him. He couldn\u2019t come to school because of TJ.</p><hr><p>The whole day, TJ had been distracted. He couldn\u2019t shake this vague nausea, because it was his fault. It was always his fault, it seemed. Everything was. He couldn\u2019t concentrate in school, he missed almost all of his shots in basketball practice, and he didn\u2019t get any of his homework done. All he did was stare at the words on the page and let them turn to mush as he shut the book angrily, rubbing his eyes harshly. He turned off the lamp and just scrolled through his phone. He wanted to send Cyrus a text, but he was too afraid. Too much of a coward. He\u2019d typed out so many messages in his notes, but never sent any of them.</p><p>Overwhelmed by emotions, he shut his phone off and tried to sleep. It was a fitful attempt to sleep, and he was tossing and turning all night long, it felt like. He was sure that he had fallen asleep at some point, because after what felt like a longer blink, his alarm went off, and he just knocked it over to the ground with a groan.</p><hr><p>Cyrus wished that he felt better after a day of just sleeping and watching YouTube videos, but he didn\u2019t. He still felt just as drained and upset, if not moreso. When his mom served him breakfast, he told her that he wasn\u2019t hungry, but that he was alright.</p><p>Having not done his homework due yesterday, he just circled random answers on the worksheets, and shoved papers into his backpack with a weak sense of urgency. He didn\u2019t know how he was going to make it through the day without Andi and Buffy asking him a ton of questions. Don\u2019t get him wrong, he loved them to death, but today was a day where he really couldn\u2019t deal with talking to people, even them.</p><p>\u201cHave a good day at school, Cyrus,\u201d his mom called after him as he opened the door.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll try,\u201d he mumbled, heading on his way. Sometimes TJ would wait for him in the morning, running from his hand and then the two of them would make their way to school, nearly hand in hand. The space around him felt almost too big as he walked, and he felt so small.</p><hr><p>The bell was too loud, there were too many students, and Cyrus felt like a stranger in the school, only having been gone for a day, though. He almost forgot his locker combination, because his brain only wanted to focus on how weak his knees felt.</p><p>\u201cCyrus!\u201d</p><p>All his thoughts came to a screeching halt at that sound. He knew damn well who it was, but all his brain seemed to chant was \u2018danger, danger, pain, pain, pain, sadness\u2019. He didn\u2019t turn around, he didn\u2019t even zip up his bag all the way, he just ran, who knows to what class. If his gym teacher could see him now, he would be beyond proud. Fortunately for him, he was running in the right direction, and ended up in his math class, nearly out of breath. He picked a seat near the back and tried to make sure that his teacher wouldn\u2019t call on him. Unzipping his bag, he pulled out his notebook from his big pocket, and then a pencil from his small one.</p><p><i>Huh</i>, he thought, zipping up the smaller pocket, <i>it was kind of open</i>. He tried not to linger on that for too long, as his teacher was about to start another lesson.</p><hr><p>TJ could only watch him run off as he stood there. He felt his heart sinking deeper and deeper into his stomach, and was about to turn and walk off a small piece of paper fluttered near the corner of the pod of lockers. Moving with utmost casualty, he walked over and picked it up before walking to his next class. While TJ usually loved history, the piece of paper burning in his pocket demanded attention. He took his usual seat near the back of the classroom, and as his teacher started talking about the Civil War, he quietly pulled out the paper and smoothed it out under his desk.</p><p>He was a little confused at first; it was a list of insults someone had written about themselves. A quick glance over revealed that they had written \u2018I\u2019m annoying\u2019 three times before they stopped. He squinted at the writing, and more he looked at it, the more worried he got. It looked an awful lot like Cyrus\u2019 handwriting. His y\u2019s were always curled at the bottom just so, his a\u2019s were never fully closed, and the way he drew his 2\u2019s were just like the ones on the page.</p><p>TJ felt his whole chest seize up. If Cyrus really did write this, which was becoming a much more real possibility with each passing moment, he couldn\u2019t help but feel like this was his fault. Did he really make Cyrus feel like this? Like he was basically worth nothing? Putting aside his worries, he ignored whatever his history teacher was saying, and pulled out another sheet of paper, keeping Cyrus\u2019 in his lap for reference. At least it looked like he was taking notes, since his teacher seemed to pay him no mind. And when the bell rang, he shoved both pieces of paper into his pocket and bolted out the door, looking for a certain boy.</p><hr><p>Last period didn\u2019t end fast enough, so when the bell finally did ring, Cyrus was the most excited that he\u2019d been all day. He still had homework he needed to catch up on, along with today\u2019s work, but all he wanted to do when he got home was to sleep more. He was almost out the door and ready to walk home, when he felt an urgent tapping on his shoulder. Turning around, he drew in a sharp breath. TJ.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d TJ mumbled, tapping his fingers nervously against his jeans.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want, TJ?\u201d Cyrus said. And it didn\u2019t come out mean, or cruel, or cold. It was just tired, like he was on his way to something.</p><p>\u201cThis is only going to take a few minutes, please,\u201d he practically begged, the urgency in his tone only growing. Being too tired to resist, Cyrus just shrugged, and TJ, wasting no more time, grabbed his wrist and dragged him towards an empty classroom, shutting the door behind him.</p><p>\u201cHurry up, I have things to do,\u201d Cyrus mumbled, taking a seat on the top of a desk.</p><p>TJ nodded, and shakily pulled out a piece of paper from his pocket. He felt like he was going to be sick, but he quickly handed it to Cyrus. When the other boy saw the paper, he immediately folded it back up, holding it close to his chest.</p><p>\u201cWh-where did you <i>find </i>this?\u201d Cyrus squeaked, his voice on the edge of cracking.</p><p>\u201cIt was on the floor by some of the lockers,\u201d he said softly, taking one of the chairs from under a desk and sitting in it, \u201cwhen?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus glanced up from his hands. \u201cWhen what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen did you write it?\u201d</p><p>He toyed with the idea of lying to him. How would he know? But after a few moments of thought, he felt like there was nothing left to lose.</p><p>\u201cThe other day,\u201d he admitted softly.</p><p>\u201cDo you <i>actually </i>believe all the things you wrote? Cyrus, those are all lies,\u201d TJ said firmly, scooting a little bit closer.</p><p>Cyrus shook his head, willing himself not to start crying, not here, and certainly not now. \u201cOf course they\u2019re true,\u201d he grumbled, \u201cwhy would you hate me if they\u2019re not?\u201d</p><p>TJ froze; if the rest of Cyrus\u2019 words were a slap to the face, this was a stab right through his heart. He literally could not speak for several moments after he\u2019d said that.</p><p>\u201cI\u2026you\u2026you think I <i>hate </i>you?\u201d He finally managed to say, his tongue feeling oddly dry.</p><p>Cyrus just shrugged again. \u201cI mean, you bailed that day,\u201d he said under his breath, kicking his legs underneath the desk.</p><p>TJ swore that if he wasn\u2019t sitting down he would have fainted. \u201cI\u2026I mean, I\u2019m really sorry for doing that, it was a crap move on my part, and there\u2019s a sort of reason why I did but\u2026I could never hate you, Cyrus, never.\u201d</p><p>When Cyrus didn\u2019t say anything, TJ pulled out the other piece of paper from his pocket, smoothing it out in front of him. \u201cI swear this won\u2019t take long, I\u2019m just asking you to hear me out,\u201d he looked up at Cyrus, who just motioned for him to hurry up.</p><p>TJ cleared his throat, tightly holding the piece of paper in his hand. \u201cYou\u2019re not annoying, not at all,\u201d he started, which barely garnered Cyrus\u2019 attention.</p><p>\u201cYou are strong,\u201d he continued.</p><p>\u201cWhat the heck is going on?\u201d</p><p>TJ put a hand up. \u201cJust listen. You\u2019re not helpless, if anything you\u2019re an independent person. You don\u2019t jump to conclusions too fast, if anything, you\u2019re good at reading people from a first glance,\u201d</p><p>Cyrus just furrowed his brows, listening to TJ talk. He glanced down at his list in his own hand, and it took him a few moments to realize that TJ was trying to counteract all the things that he\u2019d written on his own list.</p><p>\u201cBut I do get scared too easily,\u201d Cyrus mumbled, tracing his writing on the paper.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not a reason for anyone to hate you, Cyrus,\u201d TJ assured him, \u201cand\u2026you\u2019re not a bad judge of character, you\u2019re actually pretty good at it. Great, even.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPitiful,\u201d Cyrus countered, crossing his arms in defense.</p><p>\u201cLies,\u201d TJ cut him off before he could say more, \u201cyou\u2019re not pitiful. And getting too comfortable with people you barely know? More like you can make friends really easily.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but,\u201d Cyrus squints down at his own list, \u201cI\u2019m scared of stupid things.\u201d</p><p>TJ shook his head. \u201cNo, you\u2019re rational. You have rational fears,\u201d he says, looking at the next thing, \u201cand \u2018wanting things that you can\u2019t have\u2019? You have goals and dreams that you want to achieve. I have <i>no </i>idea how you thought that anyone could hate you because of that. Getting happy at dumb things? Seeing you smile is one of the best part of my days, and I don\u2019t even care what you smile about. It really doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><p>If Cyrus didn\u2019t know any better, he would have thought that he and TJ were back into their normal routine. He just looked at his list, and mumbled \u201cdork.\u201d</p><p>TJ\u2019s face grew harder by the moment, and he gripped the side of the chair with his free hand to try and keep his emotions at bay. \u201cYou are <i>not </i>a dork, Cyrus. And, for that matter, you\u2019re not clingy, you\u2019re not desperate, or a geek, or cringy. Not in the slightest.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus sighed. \u201cLook TJ, I appreciate what you\u2019re trying to do here, but you don\u2019t need to pity me like this.\u201d</p><p>His eyes widened, and for a second, nothing came out of his mouth except for a squeak. \u201cYou think this is pity? This isn\u2019t pity, I\u2019m just telling you the truth about yourself, because your mind seems to only think you\u2019re the worst. Which you\u2019re not, you\u2019re my favorite person.\u201d</p><p>TJ took a deep breath before continuing. \u201cPhysical strength? What\u2019s that got to do with someone hating you? You don\u2019t get disappointed easily, I know that for a fact, and,\u201d he pauses, hesitantly reaching up and placing a hand on Cyrus\u2019 shoulder, \u201cyou are <i>not </i>a burden. Please don\u2019t say that about yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut,\u201d he pauses, looking down at his paper, \u201cI am a bother, and nosy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not, not at all. And also, you are <i>extremely </i>helpful, Cyrus. You haven\u2019t helped just me, but so many people. You\u2019re a great friend, and all this nonsense of not being trustworthy or anything like that? It\u2019s a complete lie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven if I do try to help people, when they try and help me, I push them away,\u201d Cyrus said, glancing at TJ\u2019s hand, which was still on his shoulder. He didn\u2019t do anything to push him off, because honestly, the contact felt nice after a period of the cold shoulder.</p><p>\u201cAnd people should hate you for that? It\u2019s a coping mechanism, you should know that better than anyone,\u201d TJ informed him, \u201cand you are one of the smartest people I know, Cyrus. You\u2019re not stupid, or pathetic, where did you even get that idea?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I <i>do </i>waste people\u2019s time,\u201d he countered weakly, looking down at his lap.</p><p>TJ was so upset that Cyrus actually believed the things that he\u2019d written about him, that it just made him want to crumple right then and there. \u201cYou don\u2019t. You care so much about people, and you are always there when they need it. And you have annoying on here again, but that\u2019s not true.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus glances up at him when he says that. \u201cBut you said that I was.\u201d</p><p>TJ raised his brows. \u201cI\u2019d never say that. When did I say that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat day at the swings, after the whole Reed thing. You said that I was annoying. And judgy for that matter,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>TJ sighed, bowing his head. \u201cIt\u2026look, I\u2019m sorry for saying that, but in the heat of the moment, I was upset because\u2026I thought I was going to lose you. And I couldn\u2019t bear that.\u201d</p><p>The two of them were quiet for a little while, the only sound being the ticking clock up on the wall. Finally, TJ looked at the next things on the list, and felt like he was going to cry.</p><p>\u201cCyrus, look at me,\u201d he said firmly, meeting the other boy\u2019s gaze, \u201cI will never, and have never, hated you because of who you are. You being gay is just part of who you are, and is not a reason for me, or anyone else for that matter, to hate you,\u201d he pauses for a moment, \u201cespecially me. It\u2019d be pretty hypocritical.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus almost smiles at that. Almost. He instead just seems to relax, a breath passing through his lips. \u201cI\u2019m still weird though.\u201d</p><p>TJ just shrugged. \u201cWeird is good though. Why would anyone want to be normal?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus gave a weak smile at that, feeling a little lighter with each of TJ\u2019s words. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t change the fact that I\u2019m a bad dancer.\u201d</p><p>TJ crossed his arms. \u201cI\u2019ve seen you in the studio, Cyrus. You\u2019re not a bad dancer. You\u2019re always smiling, and you get this little smirk on your face when you\u2019re concentrating really hard. It\u2019s cute.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus ducked his head at that, and tried to tell his mind that he was still supposed to be mad at TJ, not fall for all his compliments. Before he could even say anything else, TJ beat him to it.</p><p>\u201cYou are worthy of everything, okay? You deserve the world. If anyone\u2019s a problem, it\u2019s me, not you. And you are certainly not a second best person. You\u2019re my first choice, always have been. The fact that you isolate people is, again, a coping mechanism for when you\u2019re upset. You\u2019re not a disaster, and never have been. And I hope this time you believe me when I say you\u2019re not annoying.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus nodded weakly; it felt really nice to hear someone tell him that he was their first choice. It was like he was wanted.</p><p>\u201cAnd\u2026don\u2019t say you\u2019re not attractive. You\u2019re\u2026\u201d he hesitates a little, barely able to look him in the eye, \u201cyou\u2019re beautiful, Cy, okay? All of you. Your smile, your laugh, your personality especially.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus opened his mouth to say something, but again, TJ beat him to it.</p><p>\u201cKira was going to out me if I didn\u2019t do the costume with her. I\u2019m sorry that I bailed and I\u2019m sorry that I didn\u2019t let you know, I was just so scared that she was going to tell people and I didn\u2019t-\u201d</p><p>\u201c-TJ, slow down,\u201d Cyrus cut him off, reaching out for his hand and giving it a soft squeeze, \u201cI forgive you, okay? And\u2026thank you for this. I feel a lot better now. And for the record,\u201d he laughs a little, \u201cI think you\u2019re pretty handsome yourself.\u201d</p><p>Now it was TJ\u2019s turn to try and hide his blush. He looked down at their hands, and couldn\u2019t help but smile. \u201cThanks,\u201d he mumbled bashfully, \u201cI try.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus smiled, hopping off of his desk and standing. \u201cI\u2019ve missed talking to you. What do you say we go get some ice cream and catch up?\u201d</p><p>TJ stood up with him. \u201cI\u2019d love that.\u201d</p><p>And after two rounds of ice cream and way more laughing and talking, they fell back into their normal rhythm, with a little more hand holding and hugging. But after today, their relationship was all the more stronger. When he went home that day, Cyrus through his list in the garbage, and pinned up TJ\u2019s list to the board in his room. Even when he was having a bad day, he could always look at that list and smile.</p>",

I&rsquo;m annoying</i></p><p>That one was a given, Cyrus thought. He always asked one too many questions, laughed a little too loud, and complained a little too often for people&rsquo;s likings. It only made sense that this was probably one of the main reasons that TJ probably hates him.</p><p>Hate. He doesn&rsquo;t like that word; it&rsquo;s so strong, it has so much power. Yet, it almost seems to fit the mood. After all, the costume was TJ&rsquo;s idea, not his. TJ was the one who looked so excited to do the costume based on an inside joke. And yet, TJ was the one who bailed on it. TJ was the one who did a costume with a girl he, supposedly, barely even knew.</p><p>He sighed, putting down his pen and leaning back in his chair. Maybe this didn&rsquo;t just start right around costume day. Maybe it went further back, but how far back? A week? A month? Cyrus shook his head, breathing out forcefully. Might as well start from the very beginning, he thought to himself.</p><p>The whole thing started with that damn muffin. The muffin, he pointedly thought, that he couldn&rsquo;t get for himself because he was too much of a coward to cut in line and get it for himself.</p><p><i>2. I&rsquo;m weak</i></p><p><i>3. I&rsquo;m helpless</i><br /><br /><i>Just like Jonah said</i>, he thought, but left that unwritten. He already knew that; he didn&rsquo;t want it written down.<br /><br />That day with the stupid muffin seemed almost like a far away dream to him. He was almost certain that TJ&hellip;smiled at him? It was kind of fuzzy; if you&rsquo;d asked him a week ago, he&rsquo;d be able to tell you how many steps TJ took towards him before saying &lsquo;he&rsquo;s with me&rsquo;. But now, he doubted that the whole exchange even happened. All he remembered was that he looked at TJ like this monster, like someone who could and would crush him underneath his sneaker. But&hellip;he didn&rsquo;t. He was surprisingly friendly.<br /></p><p><i>4. I jump to conclusions</i></p><p><i>5. I get scared too easily</i></p><p><i>6. I&rsquo;m a bad judge of character</i></p><p>For days after that, Cyrus had found himself lingering over their interaction, if you could even call it that. He&rsquo;d absentmindedly draw a muffin on his biology notes. At lunch, he&rsquo;d stare at his mashed potatoes so long that Buffy had to physically prod him to make him eat. And when his parents drove him home from school, the car ride was remarkably quiet.</p><p>He really thought that that would have been the first and last time that him and TJ interacted. He was <i>fairly </i>certain that was the taller boy&rsquo;s name; Buffy had mentioned her disgust for him several times before. But their conversation had only just begun.</p><p>A little while later, Cyrus had found himself drenched in sweat from head to toe because oh his goodness, he couldn&rsquo;t stop himself from getting tongue-tied in front of the camera. And it certainly didn&rsquo;t help that he was with his, now-ex, crush. That only made him want to do well <i>more</i>, which of course led to a disastrous outcome. He&rsquo;d ended up running towards the swings to try and calm down. He&rsquo;d even sung that stupid song he made up in elementary school.</p><p>And then, seemingly out of nowhere, TJ popped behind him, with a compliment for his song. And Cyrus&hellip;well, Cyrus just looked scared. He probably looked like a deer in the headlights from TJ&rsquo;s perspective. And then of course, TJ had made some joke about what he sang on the slide. Probably in a pitiful attempt to make conversation</p><p><i>7. I&rsquo;m pitiful</i></p><p>Somehow he&rsquo;d managed to convince TJ to sit and swing with him. <i>With him</i>. It felt almost natural, them sitting together on the swings. Well, not together per se, but they were on the same swing set. Separately.</p><p><i>&lsquo;You don&rsquo;t know me. I got stuff.&rsquo;</i></p><p>He&rsquo;d never forgotten those words, because in that moment, he felt almost comfortable around TJ. Like he just wanted to spill everything and get everything off his chest.</p><p><i>8. I get too comfortable with people I barely know</i></p><p>They&rsquo;d barely even talked that day. All that Cyrus had learned was that, apparently, TJ had things that he needed to feel better about, which to Cyrus, sounded absolutely absurd. He was the captain of the basketball team, people were borderline terrified of him, and let&rsquo;s be honest, he wasn&rsquo;t ugly. Far from it, actually, save for the insane amount of hair gel he used to wear.</p><p>And when he gave him an underdog, he barely remembered feeling so light and so effortless all at once. It felt like he was on top of the world, and that nothing could touch him. And the smile on TJ&rsquo;s face when he was squealing like mad&hellip;it was nice to see. Even then, Cyrus could tell he didn&rsquo;t smile like that, or maybe even at all, much.</p><p><i>9. I&rsquo;m scared of stupid things</i></p><p>And then Buffy had shown up and TJ instantly put up his walls again and wanted to hurry off. And for some weird reason, Cyrus didn&rsquo;t want him to leave. He wanted his new&hellip;friend? (if he could call him that) to make sure that he knew that Buffy was cool, and understanding when she wanted to be.</p><p><i>10. I want things that I can&rsquo;t have</i></p><p><i>&lsquo;Thanks for reminding me about swinging. That helped.&rsquo;</i></p><p>For once that day, he felt useful, like he&rsquo;d been successful in making someone just a little bit happier. He&rsquo;d gone home that day feeling pretty good about himself. Even his parents seemed to notice his good mood, but when they asked him about it, he just shrugged it off, saying that he&rsquo;d found a few dollars on his way in to school. He was fairly certain they didn&rsquo;t believe him, but they didn&rsquo;t pry anymore, simply letting them eat his dinner in peace.</p><p><i>11. I get happy at dumb things</i></p><p>A few days after their encounter at the swings, TJ somehow managed to find Cyrus again in the hallway. He looked oddly stressed, and he didn&rsquo;t have the same easygoing &lsquo;shrug it off&rsquo; demeanor that he&rsquo;d sported just a few days ago. He looked like he wanted to say something, Cyrus could tell by the way he&rsquo;d carried himself. He hadn&rsquo;t forgotten their conversation from that day.</p><p><i>&ldquo;Something on your mind?&rdquo; Cyrus had asked, rocking back on his heels.</i></p><p><i>TJ had just shrugged, tugging on his hoodie straps. &ldquo;Just&hellip;stuff,&rdquo; he&rsquo;d said lamely, but Cyrus could see behind his indifferent demeanor.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to tell me now, or ever,&rdquo; Cyrus had assured him, and was ready to walk off when TJ started pulling something out of his back pocket.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; he mumbled, handing Cyrus his phone, &ldquo;put your number in and I&rsquo;ll&hellip;tell you about it sometime, I guess,&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Cyrus had nearly dropped the boy&rsquo;s phone from pure shock. TJ was asking for his number? Well, no. More like TJ didn&rsquo;t want to talk right now and instead wanted a second method of communication.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;O-Okay,&rdquo; Cyrus had stammered out, putting his phone number in, all the while thinking about what he would write for his contact name. He wanted to make it something a little creative, but not something so stupid that it was embarrassing.</i></p><p><i>&lsquo;Cyrus (Underdog)&rsquo; he typed out, before handing it back to TJ. He had glanced down at his phone, and Cyrus had sworn he saw the ghost of a smile.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Cool, I&rsquo;ll text you,&rdquo; he&rsquo;d said, before running up to catch up with his basketball friends.</i></p><p><i>He&rsquo;d waited all weekend for TJ to text him, but he never had. He&rsquo;d even sent him a text himself.</i></p><p><i>[Cyrus: hey it&rsquo;s cyrus! but you probably know that, anyways i&rsquo;m here to listen if you ever want to talk :)]</i></p><p><i>He regretted it the moment he&rsquo;d sent it.</i></p><p><i>12. I&rsquo;m a dork</i></p><p><i>13. I&rsquo;m clingy</i></p><p>When it had come time to invite people to his bar mitzvah, the last invitation was almost shaking in his hand. Why he was so nervous to hand it to TJ was beyond him, but looking back, a crush was definitely forming. Hindsight truly was a savior. He really, <i>really </i>wanted TJ to come, so much that he probably sounded desperate when he asked.</p><p><i>14. I&rsquo;m desperate</i></p><p><i>15. I&rsquo;m a geek</i></p><p>Luckily for him, TJ had accepted; heck, he&rsquo;d even smiled at him. And then, he launched into a conversation about Buffy. Something about needing her to do something for him. And there it was, he thought, the reason that TJ had even talked to him at all. He need a favor. What? A date? Her number? TJ had ended up being pretty vague about the whole ordeal.</p><p><i>&ldquo;Just use her two favorite words,&rdquo; Cyrus had said confidently.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>He&rsquo;d paled, eyes bugging out of his head. &ldquo;No, she hates those words,&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Then what?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Cyrus had hesitated. On the one hand, he did want to keep talking to TJ. On the other hand, he didn&rsquo;t want to say something he shouldn&rsquo;t. But one look up to him, seeing him almost smiling, he nodding up the sidewalk.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Come with me. You might not like saying this, but Buffy will love hearing it.&rdquo; The two of them had walked out towards the bus stop at the front of the school. After checking to see if the coast was clear, no Buffy in sight, Cyrus had stepped in front of TJ.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; he&rsquo;d said.</i></p><p><i>TJ furrowed his brows in confusion. &ldquo;About what?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Cyrus shook his head. &ldquo;No, those are her favorite words. &lsquo;You&rsquo;re right&rsquo;. I don&rsquo;t know what it is about them, but she just&hellip;seems to cave at whatever when you say them. It&rsquo;s how I got her to sell me Tokyo,&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>TJ looked at him, even more confused than before, but there was an air of fondness in his gaze.</i></p><p><i>Cyrus waved him off. &ldquo;Monopoly. Long story.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>TJ nodded curtly, upon hearing the bus beep. &ldquo;Maybe you could tell me sometime,&rdquo; he offered, shaking his phone, &ldquo;you can use emojis and everything,&rdquo; he&rsquo;d joked, before waving and heading onto the bus.</i></p><p><i>Cyrus couldn&rsquo;t wipe that stupid smile off of his face no matter how hard he tried.</i></p><p><i>Sure enough, when he got home that night, he sent TJ a long text explaining how he just needed Tokyo to complete his collection, but Buffy wouldn&rsquo;t sell it to him. He didn&rsquo;t really remember what had happened, other than the fact that he&rsquo;d said &lsquo;you&rsquo;re right&rsquo; so many times it started to sound like a foreign language.</i></p><p><i>And this time, TJ did send him a text back</i></p><p><i>[TJ &#127936;: lol that&rsquo;s funny. i&rsquo;ll remember that. thanks for today]</i></p><p>Cyrus almost smiled as he added new things to the list. Memories of his bar mitzvah were fond, and he wishes times could be as simple as they were back then. He hadn&rsquo;t seen TJ that much, save for the time that he couldn&rsquo;t open a damn bottle.</p><p><i>&ldquo;Hey, Underdog!&rdquo; TJ had said above the music, approaching him.</i></p><p><i>Cyrus had just groaned in response, his shoulders slumping, He set the bottle back down on the table and swiped at his hairline. &ldquo;Hey, TJ,&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>TJ had looked between Cyrus and the bottle. &ldquo;Need some help?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Cyrus shook his head. &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m supposed to do this myself, you know. Be a man and all that jazz,&rdquo; he chuckles, cringing inwardly.</i></p><p><i>16. I&rsquo;m cringy</i></p><p><i>17. I have no physical strength</i></p><p><i>TJ nodded, putting his hands in his pocket, before he&rsquo;d stepped forward and grabbed the bottle. Cyrus had started to panic a little, but TJ assured him things would be fine. He&rsquo;d started to open the bottle, just a little, and then had quickly handed it over to Cyrus to finish it off.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;All yours, dude,&rdquo; he whispered, discreetly shuffling back towards the dance floor. Cyrus had stood stunned for a few moments, before he came to his senses and opened the bottle the rest of the way. It made a satisfying &lsquo;pop!&rsquo; and the foam spilled over the neck. All of his family and friends were clapping, and if he squinted, he could see TJ, clapping his hands and smiling.</i></p><p>Things seemed near perfect that day. He hadn&rsquo;t seen TJ for the rest of the party, but he assumed that he was enjoying himself. At the end of the day, when he was all dressed up in his dino pajamas, he heard his phone ding.</p><p><i>[TJ &#127936;: hey that fortune teller at your party, is she for real?]</i></p><p><i>He had swore he was having some weird form of deja vu; what he said sounded just like what Buffy had said back at the party.</i></p><p><i>[Cyrus: no, she&rsquo;s fake, she just likes to pretend she can see the future. why?]</i></p><p><i>[TJ &#127936;: oh, she just said some pretty freaky stuff, like she was for real]</i></p><p><i>[Cyrus: rest assured, she cannot see the future]</i></p><p><i>[TJ &#127936;: thank god]</i></p><p><i>[Cyrus: i, however, can. and i see you and me tomorrow at the spoon for taters]</i></p><p><i>[TJ &#127936;: can you now? i&rsquo;d love to but i have practice, sorry, maybe another time]</i></p><p><i>[Cyrus: yeah totally!!]</i></p><p><i>Cyrus had really hoped those exclamation points could mask his disappointment.</i></p><p><i>18. I get disappointed easily</i></p><p><i>19. I&rsquo;m a burden</i></p><p>Had he already written that? He didn&rsquo;t know, and he frankly didn&rsquo;t care. If he wrote it twice, maybe it was really true.</p><p>After his bar mitzvah, things seemed to be pretty at bay. Buffy was playing well on the basketball team. Life with Andi seemed less dramatic than usual, and everyone seemed to be getting alone pretty well. That was, until he went to one of the basketball games and found TJ glaring at the court, not dressed in his uniform. He&rsquo;d went over to check on him, but TJ had just brushed him off.</p><p><i>20. I&rsquo;m a bother</i></p><p><i>21. I&rsquo;m nosy</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Eating your feelings? I do that,&rdquo; he&rsquo;d tried to lighten the mood with a joke, but TJ&rsquo;s face was a palette of annoyed and frustrated. The two of them had sat down at the table in the room adjacent to the court.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Think they&rsquo;ll win without me?&rdquo; TJ had asked, his mind seeming to be anywhere else but in this conversation. It was weird not seeing him on the court, Cyrus agreed.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t even know who they&rsquo;re playing,&rdquo; he&rsquo;d admitted with a shrug.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;The Raptors,&rdquo; TJ had sighed, &ldquo;I should be in that game.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Why aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; Cyrus had asked. Way to be direct, kid.</i></p><p><i>TJ grumbled. &ldquo;&lsquo;Cause&hellip;I&rsquo;m failing math. They won&rsquo;t let me play basketball because I can&rsquo;t do some stupid equations. How are those things even related?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Cyrus had started putting pieces together, but he didn&rsquo;t want to pry. He didn&rsquo;t want to ruin the delicate friendship between him and TJ. &ldquo;Maybe you should get a different tutor,&rdquo; he&rsquo;d suggested.</i></p><p><i>TJ had just brushed him off. &ldquo;What I need is a different&hellip;brain.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Cyrus had frowned, his brows knitting into confusion. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong with yours?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>For the first time that day, TJ looked almost hesitant. &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t work. There&rsquo;s a malfunction.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>That was one way to put it, Cyrus had thought.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I might have this&hellip;math dyslexia,&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Dyscalculia,&rdquo; Cyrus had said, not missing a beat.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Buffy&rsquo;s the one who figured it out. She&rsquo;s been bugging me to talk to Coleman. Constantly on my back about it,&rdquo; TJ had sounded exasperated.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s pretty common. Not worth replacing your brain over,&rdquo; Cyrus had assured him, the beginnings of a smile starting to form.</i></p><p><i>TJ rolled his eyes. &ldquo;Dude, it&rsquo;s a-&rdquo; he was cut off by a few people entering the room, and he clammed up immediately, waiting for them to leave. When he was certain they were out of earshot, he&rsquo;d continued.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;&hellip;learning disability. I don&rsquo;t wanna go around announcing that,&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Cyrus had felt awful; TJ didn&rsquo;t deserve to feel like this. &ldquo;Dude, that&rsquo;s an overused buzzword. There is nothing wrong with you.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>TJ seemed to almost stop frowning at that. Cyrus couldn&rsquo;t back it up with evidence, he had just said it.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;And, your teacher can&rsquo;t fail you for having it.&rdquo; Of course he couldn&rsquo;t. He just regurgitated facts.</i></p><p><i>22. I&rsquo;m not helpful</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Coleman can&rsquo;t fail me,&rdquo; TJ had repeated, the words tasting almost strange in his mouth.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;You could be playing basketball. Right now.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>TJ had groaned, leaning back in his chair. &ldquo;And Buffy&rsquo;s been right all along,&rdquo; he&rsquo;d mumbled, almost chuckling to himself, &ldquo;At least this time I&rsquo;ll mean it when I tell her she&rsquo;s right. That really is her favorite thing to hear.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Cyrus had cringed internally. &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t have told you about that. She&rsquo;d kill me if she ever found out.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>TJ had scoffed at that, shaking his head. &ldquo;Ah, don&rsquo;t worry. She won&rsquo;t find out,&rdquo; he had paused for a moment, &ldquo;and she may have been right, but you&rsquo;re the one who really helped me.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Cyrus hadn&rsquo;t known what to say at that. He felt oddly proud of himself, and seeing TJ smile a little just made the whole moment better.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Cheese puff?&rdquo; TJ had offered.</i></p><p><i>Cyrus shrugged. &ldquo;Sure.&rdquo;</i></p><p>That day had been a good one, Cyrus had concluded. TJ had found him helpful, which almost made him want to erase the previous thing he&rsquo;d written. But, he figured, he&rsquo;d end up rewriting it anyways later, so why change it now.</p><p>Besides, what had happened later with Buffy only made him wince. How could he have been so careless as to tell TJ his best friend&rsquo;s weakness?</p><p><i>23. I&rsquo;m a bad friend</i></p><p><i>24. I&rsquo;m not trustworthy</i></p><p><i>25. I&rsquo;m a backstabber</i></p><p><i>26. I can&rsquo;t keep a secret</i></p><p><i>27. I&rsquo;m a liar</i></p><p><i>&lsquo;He wants to be friends with me. Who knows why?&rsquo;</i></p><p>He still thought about that sometimes. Why <i>did </i>TJ want to be friends with him? Not for his terrible humor, or for his nerdy jokes, that was for sure. TJ did seem to take pity on him after Buffy left.</p><p><i>&ldquo;Cyrus, hey!&rdquo; TJ had called out, jogging up to Cyrus&rsquo; locker, only to find him staring into the void. &nbsp;He had waved his hand in front of his face. &ldquo;Earth to Cyrus?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Cyrus had flinched, nearly hitting his head on his own locker. &ldquo;Huh? Oh, hey TJ.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Something on your mind?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Pity. Pity was all that his mind could chant at him, but somehow, he still ended up talking. &ldquo;I miss Buffy,&rdquo; he muttered, closing his eyes. It was only his first day back at school, and he was already miserable.</i></p><p><i>TJ had slung his arm across his shoulder, tugging him down the hallway towards the cafeteria. &ldquo;I know you do. But hey, she&rsquo;s just a call or a text away right?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Cyrus just shrugged, keeping his gaze down. &ldquo;I guess so,&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Do you wanna sit with me and my friends at lunch?&rdquo; TJ had offered.</i></p><p><i>Cyrus shook his head. &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m okay. Thank you though, really. I&rsquo;ll see you around.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>28. I push people away when they just want to help</i></p><p>Cyrus seemed to be pretty good at pushing people away. No matter how much he&rsquo;d isolated himself from people, especially when Buffy was away, they still managed to make an effort to sneak back into his life. Well, less <i>people </i>and more <i>TJ</i>. He&rsquo;d even apologized to a piece of metal in order to sit down with him and Andi. And then of course, in typical Cyrus fashion, he just let his emotions flow and texted him his list of things he couldn&rsquo;t do.</p><p><i>29. I&rsquo;m pathetic</i></p><p>He&rsquo;d even taken time out of his day to, first of all, drag him out of the drama between Andi and Jonah, and second of all, to teach him how to do a somersault. He didn&rsquo;t forget how his heart fluttered after they chest bumped. It felt like it did around Jonah&hellip;well, <i>used </i>to feel around Jonah.</p><p>Even when Buffy had said that his disappeared, he had lied slightly. At this point, he didn&rsquo;t want to admit that his crush didn&rsquo;t &ldquo;disappear&rdquo;, but it&hellip;moved, almost. It was like all his feelings transferred to TJ; the sweaty palms, the fluttering heart, and the indescribable desire to spend more time around him, preferably alone. Time spent alone with TJ was some of the best time of his life.</p><p><i>&ldquo;Okay, so go over this one more time?&rdquo; TJ had sighed, swirling his straw in his milkshake.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;So,&rdquo; Cyrus started, clearing his throat, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll find a way to get Buffy to the basketball courts, and then you show up, I&rsquo;ll disappear, then you two can talk for a little, I&rsquo;ll come back and then you guys will play some one on one,&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>TJ had chuckled, leaning back in the booth. &ldquo;Wow, you&rsquo;ve really thought about this, huh?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Cyrus was probably blushing now, and he tried to hide it by shrugging and sipping his milkshake. &ldquo;Just a little bit,&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s a pretty good idea. You&rsquo;re full of them.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Cyrus was now for sure blushing. &ldquo;Eh, I try.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;You succeed.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Why did he have to say these things? It only made Cyrus more and more and more flustered.</i></p><p>That day was one of his fondest memories with TJ. It was also probably when he realized how intense his crush really was. And when the day came for the basketball game, it was a little shaky, but it had worked out. Heck, TJ had even performed an apology rap for Buffy.</p><p><i>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m so confused.&rsquo;</i></p><p>So was Cyrus that day. He didn&rsquo;t know why TJ had even agreed to go through all this effort just to apologize for Buffy. Maybe it&rsquo;d be nice to befriend someone he liked, Cyrus thought. After all, that&rsquo;s how it went for him and Jonah, but at least that crush was in the past.</p><p><i>30. I&rsquo;m stupid</i></p><p>After Buffy had decided to start her basketball team, she had enlisted in Cyrus, and Andi a little, to help put up posters. Andi made them, Cyrus had to hang them. TJ had even offered to help him do that.</p><p><i>&ldquo;Need some help down there?&rdquo; TJ&rsquo;s voice had floated down the hallway, a stupid grin on his face.</i></p><p><i>Cyrus had jumped one last time to try and pin the poster up, but to no avail. &ldquo;Is it that obvious?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>TJ had chuckled at that, plucking the poster from his hands. &ldquo;Huh. &lsquo;Girls Basketball Tryouts This Week&rsquo;. You trying out for the team, Underdog?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Cyrus huffed at that, crossing his arms. &ldquo;No. I&rsquo;m just on poster-hanging duty. Which I seem to be failing at.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Here, I&rsquo;ll help you,&rdquo; he&rsquo;d offered, handing the poster back to Cyrus.</i></p><p><i>Cyrus scowled, looking between the poster and TJ. &ldquo;I told you that I couldn&rsquo;t reach the-hey!&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>And before Cyrus knew it his feet weren&rsquo;t on the ground anymore. TJ had a firm grip on him, and Cyrus was just squirming.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I could do it for you but, teach a man to fish?&rdquo; he had repeated his mantra from when they first met each other.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;TJ, put me down!&rdquo; Cyrus giggled, his legs kicking in the air.</i></p><p><i>TJ eventually gave in, putting him down, smiling widely. &ldquo;Fine, fine, I&rsquo;ll help put them up. The normal way.&rdquo;</i></p><p>It had taken them way longer than expected to put up the posters, probably because they were just a chaotic duo, but Cyrus wouldn&rsquo;t have had it any other way. It was way more fun than expected, even if it took a long time.</p><p><i>31. I waste people&rsquo;s time</i></p><p>TJ was always one to push him out of his comfort zone, literally and figuratively. The day they went dirt biking was probably the epitome of that fact. The day was supposed to be a great one, seeing as he finally was getting around to meeting TJ&rsquo;s friends. But things turned sour once Reed had shown him the gun. And when he confronted TJ about it, he barely said anything. Worse, he didn&rsquo;t leave either. He was so concerned with his safety, as well as TJ&rsquo;s, but still managed to walk off without him.</p><p><i>32. I&rsquo;m careless</i></p><p>And then <i>worse</i>, he thought, was when he went to talk to Metcalf and the police about the gun. He felt so panicked the whole day after that encounter that he couldn&rsquo;t even eat lunch. And considering he wasn&rsquo;t allowed to talk to TJ all day, thanks to his friends, it felt worse. Don&rsquo;t get him wrong, he appreciated what Buffy and Andi did for him, but he really wanted to clear things up with TJ. When they talked it out on the swings, he had no idea why he said the things he did.</p><p><i>&ldquo;You can be a little annoying, you know that?&rdquo; TJ had said, taking a step towards him.</i></p><p><i>33. I&rsquo;m annoying</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Well, you can be oblivious,&rdquo; Cyrus had countered weakly. He didn&rsquo;t even know where the word oblivious came from. Oblivious to what? To the fact that sitting there with Reed was putting him in obvious danger? Or to the fact that Cyrus had an undeniable crush on him?</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Well you can be very judgy,&rdquo; TJ had remarked, taking another step forward.</i></p><p><i>34. I&rsquo;m judgy</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Well you can be intimidating,&rdquo; Cyrus had replied, and was surprised his voice wasn&rsquo;t wobbling.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;You know what else you are?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>That sounded like a threat. TJ could fill it in with any word in the world. Nosy. Irritating. Not my friend. He had told himself to keep his composure.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; How he had managed to say that without his voice breaking was beyond him.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;The only person I can talk to like this,&rdquo; he had said softer. Cyrus thought he was going to faint; he said what? He couldn&rsquo;t help but smile at that.</i></p><p>That day seemed like light years away now, so far that it was nothing but a mere memory. He almost wishes he was back on the swingset with TJ, just swinging mindlessly. Or maybe he wants to go back to playing ping-pong with him and Jonah after they&rsquo;d resolved their issues. It had been a bit of a stressful day for the most part, but seeing Jonah and TJ make up made it all worth it. Although, when they were talking about &lsquo;stuff&rsquo; they had to do with, Cyrus had chickened out and said something about flamingos. He barely remembered, but he knew it was a lie. They&rsquo;d played a few more round until Jonah decided to head over to the Red Rooster with Andi, leaving him and TJ.</p><p><i>&ldquo;So, flamingos, huh?&rdquo; TJ had chuckled, picking up the ping-pong balls that remained on the floor.</i></p><p><i>Cyrus had just shrugged, trying to ignore the fact that his heart was hammering in his chest: a clear sign that he was lying. Couple that with feeling like he couldn&rsquo;t swallow, and you had a recipe for disaster.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Yup,&rdquo; he squeaked, putting the paddles on top of each other, &ldquo;real and plastic,&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>TJ had just hummed in response, leaning against the table. &ldquo;So when we went to the zoo that time and you were spitting out facts about why flamingos are pink, while you pointed at them&hellip;your fear just happened to disappear then?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Cyrus gulped, trailing his finger around the rim of the paddles. &ldquo;That&hellip;that&rsquo;s the day it started?&rdquo; he&rsquo;s said, but it sounded like a question.</i></p><p><i>TJ&rsquo;s expression had softened, and he&rsquo;d come up to Cyrus, putting his hand on his shoulder. &ldquo;Stuff?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Cyrus nodded weakly in response. &ldquo;Yeah, stuff,&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Swings?&rdquo; TJ had offered.</i></p><p><i>Cyrus shook his head, nodding over to the stairs. &ldquo;Stairs,&rdquo; he&rsquo;d mumbled, going and taking a seat on the second to the last stair. TJ had sat down beside him, and he didn&rsquo;t push him to talk. He knew Cyrus would talk when he was good and ready.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Look,&rdquo; he started, &ldquo;this&hellip;this is something that I think about a lot, you know? It&rsquo;s not&hellip;something I&rsquo;m ashamed of, I just don&rsquo;t tell people that I don&rsquo;t trust,&rdquo; he admitted.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Unless you killed someone I swear I&rsquo;ll keep whatever you tell me a secret,&rdquo; TJ had promised, crossing his heart, &ldquo;and even then, I&rsquo;d help you hide the body.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Cyrus breathed out a laugh at that. &ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s not that it&rsquo;s&hellip;I don&rsquo;t like girls,&rdquo; he said lamely, waving his hands in the air a little, &ldquo;I mean, I-I like guys. Like, in a romantic way,&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>TJ had remained quiet for a moment, waiting to see if Cyrus had anything else to say, but when he didn&rsquo;t he just nudged him lightly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you told me. It was brave,&rdquo; he paused, looking up to face him, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re brave, Cyrus. Braver than you give yourself credit for,&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Cyrus had smiled softly, breathing out and feeling like the oxygen was actually getting to his lungs. &ldquo;So&hellip;we&rsquo;re still cool? You and me?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>TJ had scoffed, nudging him once more. &ldquo;Of course we are! It&rsquo;ll take a lot more than this for things to be not cool between us.&rdquo;</i></p><p>He kept thinking about that day; what if it wasn&rsquo;t the best time to come out to TJ? What if he actually did think it was weird and was just trying to keep the situation as light as possible? All these what ifs, Cyrus concluded, could be boiled down.</p><p><i>35. I&rsquo;m gay</i></p><p>He sighed, staring at that statement for a while. It was true, but the idea that TJ could hate him for something he couldn&rsquo;t control&hellip;it hurt a lot. Almost too much, but he had to write down <i>every </i>possibility, <i>every </i>possible thing.</p><p><i>36. I&rsquo;m weird</i></p><p>That one was a little more general, he supposed. Weird could cover a lot of things, not just being who he was, but all his nerdy hyperfixations, the way he acted around people, and his choice to never really go out with friends to parties. Too many reasons to list, so it was all boiled down to one word.</p><p>One word. That seemed to be all TJ could say after his dance recital that one weekend.</p><p><i>He&rsquo;d finished the routine and was in the locker room wrapping up and putting his things into his duffel bag when they door swung open. TJ was walking his way, a hand behind his back.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Wow,&rdquo; he&rsquo;d said, a gentle smile on his face.</i></p><p><i>Cyrus waited for him to say more, even along the lines of how ridiculous he&rsquo;d looked on stage, flopping around like boiled pasta, but he didn&rsquo;t say anything else.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Wow? That&rsquo;s it?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Wow, wow,&rdquo; he repeated, pulling out a small dandelion from behind his back and handing it to Cyrus with a sheepish smile on his face, &ldquo;&hellip;wow,&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Cyrus had accepted the flower graciously, and TJ had said something about catching up with his sister before he left for practice.</i></p><p><i>37. I&rsquo;m a bad dancer</i></p><p>TJ somehow knew that dandelions were Cyrus&rsquo; favorite, probably from the numerous times he&rsquo;d said that. He always knew just what to bring to every event, even to his Bubbe Rose&rsquo; shiva. How did he know to bring challah bread?</p><p><i>&ldquo;Hey, Cyrus,&rdquo; TJ had caught him alone, after the others had left and his family was cleaning dishes up and packing away food.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;TJ, hi,&rdquo; he&rsquo;d returned with a small smile, stacking one plate on top of another, &ldquo;you know we&rsquo;re wrapping up and all, you can go home,&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; he&rsquo;d said, putting his hands in his pockets, &ldquo;I just wanted to say that&hellip;I&rsquo;m sorry for your loss. I know that she was really important to you, and I don&rsquo;t know how much it&rsquo;s going to mean coming from me, but&hellip;she cares about you a lot. We all do,&rdquo; he&rsquo;d gestured vaguely to the people around the room.</i></p><p><i>Cyrus had felt like crying right then and there, but he didn&rsquo;t, somehow. He just smiled wider than before. &ldquo;That does mean a lot, thank you, really. I know she does, I just&hellip;I miss her a lot already,&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I know, and&hellip;if you ever want to talk about anything, tell me stories about her, or you just want me to distract you from this with a basketball story, I&rsquo;m there.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Thank you, TJ. That means a lot.&rdquo;</i></p><p>How had things managed to go from almost perfect, to the disastrous state that they were in now? He wanted to say that he didn&rsquo;t understand, but he did. He knew that it had to do with himself, because that always seemed to be the problem. <i>He </i>always seemed to be the problem. The things he wrote just started to spill out of him.</p><p><i>38. I&rsquo;m not worthy</i></p><p><i>39. I&rsquo;m always the problem</i></p><p><i>40. I&rsquo;m there when I&rsquo;m not wanted</i></p><p><i>41. I&rsquo;m a second-best person</i></p><p><i>42. I&rsquo;m not attractive</i></p><p><i>43. I isolate myself from people</i></p><p><i>44. I&rsquo;m a disaster</i></p><p><i>45. I&rsquo;m annoying</i></p><p>He stopped writing for a second; the last words he&rsquo;d written looked familiar. He scanned over the list and found that he&rsquo;d written &lsquo;I&rsquo;m annoying&rsquo; three times. Sighing, he set the pen down and closed his eyes. Annoying. He&rsquo;d written it so many times, that was probably the main reason, he deducted. With a shaky hand, he folded up the paper and shoved it into a backpack pocket of his. He didn&rsquo;t feel particularly upset, he just felt numb, and a little tired. He managed to trudge down the stairs, where his mom was sitting and cutting up some vegetables for tonight&rsquo;s dinner.</p><p>&ldquo;Cyrus, sweetie, how are you feeling?&rdquo; she asked sweetly, wiping her hands on the towel.</p><p>He just shrugged, unable to maintain eye contact for longer than a second. &ldquo;Not&hellip;great. Is it okay if I stay home from school tomorrow?&rdquo;</p><p>She softened at that, coming over to him and giving his shoulder a light squeeze. &ldquo;I know you&rsquo;re upset, but avoiding-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;-just one day, please mom. I swear I&rsquo;ll go back the day after. I promise. I just need tomorrow,&rdquo; he pleaded, looking up at her, eyes filled with a layer of unshed tears.</p><p>She looked over his facial features for a few seconds before her shoulders relaxed, and she nodded weakly. &ldquo;Okay, you have tomorrow, okay? Do whatever you need to do and if you want to be alone, that&rsquo;s fine. If you need someone to talk to-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;-I can call another therapist,&rdquo; Cyrus half-joked, offering a tiny smile, &ldquo;thanks, mom. I&rsquo;ll be in my room for a little while. Think I&rsquo;ll just take a nap.&rdquo;</p><p>She nodded, watching him worriedly as he walked up the stairs and quietly shut the door to his room with a gentle click. He collapsed onto his bed, and he lied there forever until he felt like he couldn&rsquo;t breathe through his nose. When did he start crying? Cyrus didn&rsquo;t even know the answer to that simple question, and he was too weary to think about it. He pulled the covers over his head, closed his eyes, and waited for all the thoughts swirling around his head to settle down, before he finally fell asleep.</p><hr /><p>The next time Cyrus woke up, it was pretty dark outside, and he squinted at his alarm clock. It was close to eleven thirty, and he just sighed, grabbing his phone off of his stand and opened it to check through his notifications.. A few texts from Andi and Buffy in their group chat, one from Amber about dance, and none from TJ.</p><p><b>[buffy: hey cy are you okay?]</b></p><p><b>[andi: yeah, we&rsquo;re worried. but we&rsquo;ll talk to you tomorrow]</b></p><p><b>[cyrus: i&rsquo;m not going tomorrow, i don&rsquo;t feel well]</b></p><p><b>[andi: are you okay? do you need soup or something?]</b></p><p><b>[buffy: yeah do you need us to come over?]</b></p><p><b>[cyrus: no that&rsquo;s fine, it&rsquo;s not that bad, but i did manage to convince my mom to let me stay home]</b></p><p><b>[buffy: the talented actor mr cyrus goodman]</b></p><p><b>[cyrus: i&rsquo;m not lying, it&rsquo;s the truth, it&rsquo;s just not the worst pain i could be in]</b></p><p><b>[andi: well if you need anything, just text us]</b></p><p><b>[cyrus: i will, i love you guys]</b></p><p><b>[buffy: we love you too!]</b></p><p><b>[andi: &lt;3]</b></p><p>Cyrus felt drained just from that short conversation, and he put his phone aside, staring up at the ceiling. It irked him that TJ hadn&rsquo;t sent him a text, especially after what had happened. If he wanted to apologize, which maybe he didn&rsquo;t, a text would have been a start, because on Costume Day, there was nothing more than a few &lsquo;I&rsquo;m sorrys&rsquo; and &lsquo;I should have called&rsquo;. It wasn&rsquo;t enough, not in the slightest, but as the days went on, desperation started to seep in, and Cyrus tried to convince himself that it was enough of an apology for him to just forget all of this happened. But no matter how many times he said that to himself in the mirror, he never could actually, genuinely believe himself. After a little more thinking about the matter, he pulled the covers back over his head, and fell asleep again.</p><hr /><p>&ldquo;C&rsquo;mon, c&rsquo;mon,&rdquo; TJ muttered under his breath, scanning through the hallway to try and find a certain brown-eyed boy walking through the hallways. But the more time that passed, the more his hope drained, and he retreated to his locker. Thankfully, he saw Buffy and Andi walking together, and nearly pushed people over to talk to them.</p><p>&ldquo;Have you guys seen Cyrus today?&rdquo; He asked, nearly out of breath, and looking mildly disheveled.</p><p>The two girls exchanged looks, not really wanting to talk to TJ at the moment, but they just gave him cold gazes. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s sick,&rdquo; Buffy said simply.</p><p>&ldquo;Wait, what? It&rsquo;s, like, basically summer,&rdquo; TJ sputtered, rubbing the back of his neck.</p><p>Andi shrugged. &ldquo;All I know is that he said he felt too tired and too weak to come to school today. Should be back tomorrow,&rdquo; she said curtly, pivoting on her foot and heading to her next class, Buffy following close behind.</p><p>TJ just stood in the middle of the hallway, dumbfounded. Cyrus wasn&rsquo;t in school today, and he couldn&rsquo;t help but feel like it was his fault. Tired and weak, they&rsquo;d said. That didn&rsquo;t sound like a typical cold, and he tried not to jump to the worst possible conclusion, but his mind didn&rsquo;t allow him to do that. Cyrus was home because he wanted to avoid him. He couldn&rsquo;t come to school because of TJ.</p><hr /><p>The whole day, TJ had been distracted. He couldn&rsquo;t shake this vague nausea, because it was his fault. It was always his fault, it seemed. Everything was. He couldn&rsquo;t concentrate in school, he missed almost all of his shots in basketball practice, and he didn&rsquo;t get any of his homework done. All he did was stare at the words on the page and let them turn to mush as he shut the book angrily, rubbing his eyes harshly. He turned off the lamp and just scrolled through his phone. He wanted to send Cyrus a text, but he was too afraid. Too much of a coward. He&rsquo;d typed out so many messages in his notes, but never sent any of them.</p><p>Overwhelmed by emotions, he shut his phone off and tried to sleep. It was a fitful attempt to sleep, and he was tossing and turning all night long, it felt like. He was sure that he had fallen asleep at some point, because after what felt like a longer blink, his alarm went off, and he just knocked it over to the ground with a groan.</p><hr /><p>Cyrus wished that he felt better after a day of just sleeping and watching YouTube videos, but he didn&rsquo;t. He still felt just as drained and upset, if not moreso. When his mom served him breakfast, he told her that he wasn&rsquo;t hungry, but that he was alright.</p><p>Having not done his homework due yesterday, he just circled random answers on the worksheets, and shoved papers into his backpack with a weak sense of urgency. He didn&rsquo;t know how he was going to make it through the day without Andi and Buffy asking him a ton of questions. Don&rsquo;t get him wrong, he loved them to death, but today was a day where he really couldn&rsquo;t deal with talking to people, even them.</p><p>&ldquo;Have a good day at school, Cyrus,&rdquo; his mom called after him as he opened the door.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try,&rdquo; he mumbled, heading on his way. Sometimes TJ would wait for him in the morning, running from his hand and then the two of them would make their way to school, nearly hand in hand. The space around him felt almost too big as he walked, and he felt so small.</p><hr /><p>The bell was too loud, there were too many students, and Cyrus felt like a stranger in the school, only having been gone for a day, though. He almost forgot his locker combination, because his brain only wanted to focus on how weak his knees felt.</p><p>&ldquo;Cyrus!&rdquo;</p><p>All his thoughts came to a screeching halt at that sound. He knew damn well who it was, but all his brain seemed to chant was &lsquo;danger, danger, pain, pain, pain, sadness&rsquo;. He didn&rsquo;t turn around, he didn&rsquo;t even zip up his bag all the way, he just ran, who knows to what class. If his gym teacher could see him now, he would be beyond proud. Fortunately for him, he was running in the right direction, and ended up in his math class, nearly out of breath. He picked a seat near the back and tried to make sure that his teacher wouldn&rsquo;t call on him. Unzipping his bag, he pulled out his notebook from his big pocket, and then a pencil from his small one.</p><p><i>Huh</i>, he thought, zipping up the smaller pocket, <i>it was kind of open</i>. He tried not to linger on that for too long, as his teacher was about to start another lesson.</p><hr /><p>TJ could only watch him run off as he stood there. He felt his heart sinking deeper and deeper into his stomach, and was about to turn and walk off a small piece of paper fluttered near the corner of the pod of lockers. Moving with utmost casualty, he walked over and picked it up before walking to his next class. While TJ usually loved history, the piece of paper burning in his pocket demanded attention. He took his usual seat near the back of the classroom, and as his teacher started talking about the Civil War, he quietly pulled out the paper and smoothed it out under his desk.</p><p>He was a little confused at first; it was a list of insults someone had written about themselves. A quick glance over revealed that they had written &lsquo;I&rsquo;m annoying&rsquo; three times before they stopped. He squinted at the writing, and more he looked at it, the more worried he got. It looked an awful lot like Cyrus&rsquo; handwriting. His y&rsquo;s were always curled at the bottom just so, his a&rsquo;s were never fully closed, and the way he drew his 2&rsquo;s were just like the ones on the page.</p><p>TJ felt his whole chest seize up. If Cyrus really did write this, which was becoming a much more real possibility with each passing moment, he couldn&rsquo;t help but feel like this was his fault. Did he really make Cyrus feel like this? Like he was basically worth nothing? Putting aside his worries, he ignored whatever his history teacher was saying, and pulled out another sheet of paper, keeping Cyrus&rsquo; in his lap for reference. At least it looked like he was taking notes, since his teacher seemed to pay him no mind. And when the bell rang, he shoved both pieces of paper into his pocket and bolted out the door, looking for a certain boy.</p><hr /><p>Last period didn&rsquo;t end fast enough, so when the bell finally did ring, Cyrus was the most excited that he&rsquo;d been all day. He still had homework he needed to catch up on, along with today&rsquo;s work, but all he wanted to do when he got home was to sleep more. He was almost out the door and ready to walk home, when he felt an urgent tapping on his shoulder. Turning around, he drew in a sharp breath. TJ.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey,&rdquo; TJ mumbled, tapping his fingers nervously against his jeans.</p><p>&ldquo;What do you want, TJ?&rdquo; Cyrus said. And it didn&rsquo;t come out mean, or cruel, or cold. It was just tired, like he was on his way to something.</p><p>&ldquo;This is only going to take a few minutes, please,&rdquo; he practically begged, the urgency in his tone only growing. Being too tired to resist, Cyrus just shrugged, and TJ, wasting no more time, grabbed his wrist and dragged him towards an empty classroom, shutting the door behind him.</p><p>&ldquo;Hurry up, I have things to do,&rdquo; Cyrus mumbled, taking a seat on the top of a desk.</p><p>TJ nodded, and shakily pulled out a piece of paper from his pocket. He felt like he was going to be sick, but he quickly handed it to Cyrus. When the other boy saw the paper, he immediately folded it back up, holding it close to his chest.</p><p>&ldquo;Wh-where did you <i>find </i>this?&rdquo; Cyrus squeaked, his voice on the edge of cracking.</p><p>&ldquo;It was on the floor by some of the lockers,&rdquo; he said softly, taking one of the chairs from under a desk and sitting in it, &ldquo;when?&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus glanced up from his hands. &ldquo;When what?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;When did you write it?&rdquo;</p><p>He toyed with the idea of lying to him. How would he know? But after a few moments of thought, he felt like there was nothing left to lose.</p><p>&ldquo;The other day,&rdquo; he admitted softly.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you <i>actually </i>believe all the things you wrote? Cyrus, those are all lies,&rdquo; TJ said firmly, scooting a little bit closer.</p><p>Cyrus shook his head, willing himself not to start crying, not here, and certainly not now. &ldquo;Of course they&rsquo;re true,&rdquo; he grumbled, &ldquo;why would you hate me if they&rsquo;re not?&rdquo;</p><p>TJ froze; if the rest of Cyrus&rsquo; words were a slap to the face, this was a stab right through his heart. He literally could not speak for several moments after he&rsquo;d said that.</p><p>&ldquo;I&hellip;you&hellip;you think I <i>hate </i>you?&rdquo; He finally managed to say, his tongue feeling oddly dry.</p><p>Cyrus just shrugged again. &ldquo;I mean, you bailed that day,&rdquo; he said under his breath, kicking his legs underneath the desk.</p><p>TJ swore that if he wasn&rsquo;t sitting down he would have fainted. &ldquo;I&hellip;I mean, I&rsquo;m really sorry for doing that, it was a crap move on my part, and there&rsquo;s a sort of reason why I did but&hellip;I could never hate you, Cyrus, never.&rdquo;</p><p>When Cyrus didn&rsquo;t say anything, TJ pulled out the other piece of paper from his pocket, smoothing it out in front of him. &ldquo;I swear this won&rsquo;t take long, I&rsquo;m just asking you to hear me out,&rdquo; he looked up at Cyrus, who just motioned for him to hurry up.</p><p>TJ cleared his throat, tightly holding the piece of paper in his hand. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not annoying, not at all,&rdquo; he started, which barely garnered Cyrus&rsquo; attention.</p><p>&ldquo;You are strong,&rdquo; he continued.</p><p>&ldquo;What the heck is going on?&rdquo;</p><p>TJ put a hand up. &ldquo;Just listen. You&rsquo;re not helpless, if anything you&rsquo;re an independent person. You don&rsquo;t jump to conclusions too fast, if anything, you&rsquo;re good at reading people from a first glance,&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus just furrowed his brows, listening to TJ talk. He glanced down at his list in his own hand, and it took him a few moments to realize that TJ was trying to counteract all the things that he&rsquo;d written on his own list.</p><p>&ldquo;But I do get scared too easily,&rdquo; Cyrus mumbled, tracing his writing on the paper.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not a reason for anyone to hate you, Cyrus,&rdquo; TJ assured him, &ldquo;and&hellip;you&rsquo;re not a bad judge of character, you&rsquo;re actually pretty good at it. Great, even.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Pitiful,&rdquo; Cyrus countered, crossing his arms in defense.</p><p>&ldquo;Lies,&rdquo; TJ cut him off before he could say more, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re not pitiful. And getting too comfortable with people you barely know? More like you can make friends really easily.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, but,&rdquo; Cyrus squints down at his own list, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m scared of stupid things.&rdquo;</p><p>TJ shook his head. &ldquo;No, you&rsquo;re rational. You have rational fears,&rdquo; he says, looking at the next thing, &ldquo;and &lsquo;wanting things that you can&rsquo;t have&rsquo;? You have goals and dreams that you want to achieve. I have <i>no </i>idea how you thought that anyone could hate you because of that. Getting happy at dumb things? Seeing you smile is one of the best part of my days, and I don&rsquo;t even care what you smile about. It really doesn&rsquo;t matter.&rdquo;</p><p>If Cyrus didn&rsquo;t know any better, he would have thought that he and TJ were back into their normal routine. He just looked at his list, and mumbled &ldquo;dork.&rdquo;</p><p>TJ&rsquo;s face grew harder by the moment, and he gripped the side of the chair with his free hand to try and keep his emotions at bay. &ldquo;You are <i>not </i>a dork, Cyrus. And, for that matter, you&rsquo;re not clingy, you&rsquo;re not desperate, or a geek, or cringy. Not in the slightest.&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus sighed. &ldquo;Look TJ, I appreciate what you&rsquo;re trying to do here, but you don&rsquo;t need to pity me like this.&rdquo;</p><p>His eyes widened, and for a second, nothing came out of his mouth except for a squeak. &ldquo;You think this is pity? This isn&rsquo;t pity, I&rsquo;m just telling you the truth about yourself, because your mind seems to only think you&rsquo;re the worst. Which you&rsquo;re not, you&rsquo;re my favorite person.&rdquo;</p><p>TJ took a deep breath before continuing. &ldquo;Physical strength? What&rsquo;s that got to do with someone hating you? You don&rsquo;t get disappointed easily, I know that for a fact, and,&rdquo; he pauses, hesitantly reaching up and placing a hand on Cyrus&rsquo; shoulder, &ldquo;you are <i>not </i>a burden. Please don&rsquo;t say that about yourself.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; he pauses, looking down at his paper, &ldquo;I am a bother, and nosy.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not, not at all. And also, you are <i>extremely </i>helpful, Cyrus. You haven&rsquo;t helped just me, but so many people. You&rsquo;re a great friend, and all this nonsense of not being trustworthy or anything like that? It&rsquo;s a complete lie.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Even if I do try to help people, when they try and help me, I push them away,&rdquo; Cyrus said, glancing at TJ&rsquo;s hand, which was still on his shoulder. He didn&rsquo;t do anything to push him off, because honestly, the contact felt nice after a period of the cold shoulder.</p><p>&ldquo;And people should hate you for that? It&rsquo;s a coping mechanism, you should know that better than anyone,&rdquo; TJ informed him, &ldquo;and you are one of the smartest people I know, Cyrus. You&rsquo;re not stupid, or pathetic, where did you even get that idea?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But I <i>do </i>waste people&rsquo;s time,&rdquo; he countered weakly, looking down at his lap.</p><p>TJ was so upset that Cyrus actually believed the things that he&rsquo;d written about him, that it just made him want to crumple right then and there. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t. You care so much about people, and you are always there when they need it. And you have annoying on here again, but that&rsquo;s not true.&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus glances up at him when he says that. &ldquo;But you said that I was.&rdquo;</p><p>TJ raised his brows. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d never say that. When did I say that?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That day at the swings, after the whole Reed thing. You said that I was annoying. And judgy for that matter,&rdquo; he muttered.</p><p>TJ sighed, bowing his head. &ldquo;It&hellip;look, I&rsquo;m sorry for saying that, but in the heat of the moment, I was upset because&hellip;I thought I was going to lose you. And I couldn&rsquo;t bear that.&rdquo;</p><p>The two of them were quiet for a little while, the only sound being the ticking clock up on the wall. Finally, TJ looked at the next things on the list, and felt like he was going to cry.</p><p>&ldquo;Cyrus, look at me,&rdquo; he said firmly, meeting the other boy&rsquo;s gaze, &ldquo;I will never, and have never, hated you because of who you are. You being gay is just part of who you are, and is not a reason for me, or anyone else for that matter, to hate you,&rdquo; he pauses for a moment, &ldquo;especially me. It&rsquo;d be pretty hypocritical.&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus almost smiles at that. Almost. He instead just seems to relax, a breath passing through his lips. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m still weird though.&rdquo;</p><p>TJ just shrugged. &ldquo;Weird is good though. Why would anyone want to be normal?&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus gave a weak smile at that, feeling a little lighter with each of TJ&rsquo;s words. &ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t change the fact that I&rsquo;m a bad dancer.&rdquo;</p><p>TJ crossed his arms. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen you in the studio, Cyrus. You&rsquo;re not a bad dancer. You&rsquo;re always smiling, and you get this little smirk on your face when you&rsquo;re concentrating really hard. It&rsquo;s cute.&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus ducked his head at that, and tried to tell his mind that he was still supposed to be mad at TJ, not fall for all his compliments. Before he could even say anything else, TJ beat him to it.</p><p>&ldquo;You are worthy of everything, okay? You deserve the world. If anyone&rsquo;s a problem, it&rsquo;s me, not you. And you are certainly not a second best person. You&rsquo;re my first choice, always have been. The fact that you isolate people is, again, a coping mechanism for when you&rsquo;re upset. You&rsquo;re not a disaster, and never have been. And I hope this time you believe me when I say you&rsquo;re not annoying.&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus nodded weakly; it felt really nice to hear someone tell him that he was their first choice. It was like he was wanted.</p><p>&ldquo;And&hellip;don&rsquo;t say you&rsquo;re not attractive. You&rsquo;re&hellip;&rdquo; he hesitates a little, barely able to look him in the eye, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re beautiful, Cy, okay? All of you. Your smile, your laugh, your personality especially.&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus opened his mouth to say something, but again, TJ beat him to it.</p><p>&ldquo;Kira was going to out me if I didn&rsquo;t do the costume with her. I&rsquo;m sorry that I bailed and I&rsquo;m sorry that I didn&rsquo;t let you know, I was just so scared that she was going to tell people and I didn&rsquo;t-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;-TJ, slow down,&rdquo; Cyrus cut him off, reaching out for his hand and giving it a soft squeeze, &ldquo;I forgive you, okay? And&hellip;thank you for this. I feel a lot better now. And for the record,&rdquo; he laughs a little, &ldquo;I think you&rsquo;re pretty handsome yourself.&rdquo;</p><p>Now it was TJ&rsquo;s turn to try and hide his blush. He looked down at their hands, and couldn&rsquo;t help but smile. &ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; he mumbled bashfully, &ldquo;I try.&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus smiled, hopping off of his desk and standing. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve missed talking to you. What do you say we go get some ice cream and catch up?&rdquo;</p><p>TJ stood up with him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d love that.&rdquo;</p><p>And after two rounds of ice cream and way more laughing and talking, they fell back into their normal rhythm, with a little more hand holding and hugging. But after today, their relationship was all the more stronger. When he went home that day, Cyrus through his list in the garbage, and pinned up TJ&rsquo;s list to the board in his room. Even when he was having a bad day, he could always look at that list and smile.</p>",

I&rsquo;m annoying</i></p>\n<p>That one was a given, Cyrus thought. He always asked one too many questions, laughed a little too loud, and complained a little too often for people&rsquo;s likings. It only made sense that this was probably one of the main reasons that TJ probably hates him.</p>\n<p>Hate. He doesn&rsquo;t like that word; it&rsquo;s so strong, it has so much power. Yet, it almost seems to fit the mood. After all, the costume was TJ&rsquo;s idea, not his. TJ was the one who looked so excited to do the costume based on an inside joke. And yet, TJ was the one who bailed on it. TJ was the one who did a costume with a girl he, supposedly, barely even knew.</p>\n<p>He sighed, putting down his pen and leaning back in his chair. Maybe this didn&rsquo;t just start right around costume day. Maybe it went further back, but how far back? A week? A month? Cyrus shook his head, breathing out forcefully. Might as well start from the very beginning, he thought to himself.</p>\n</p>",

I was nervous too. It was kinda my first date.\u201d He admits.</p><p>\u201cThis was a date?\u201d Andi\u2019s ecstatic. </p><p>\u201cYeah! Well, maybe not officially, but, we could have a do-over. Somewhere more&hellip;\u201d He looks around to those surrounding them. \u201cPrivate.\u201d </p><p>They all chuckle. </p><p>\u201cYeah, that sounds nice.\u201d Andi says. \u201cUh, before you go&hellip;\u201d She properly introduces him to each of them. </p><p>\u201cNice meeting you guys.\u201d He says to them. \u201cBye.\u201d He hugs Andi once more, giving her a huge smile and feeling the rest of them keep watch on him as he walks off. </p><p>Once he\u2019s out of earshot, the guys consider him pretty lucky considering just how much Andi and Buffy are squealing to each other. </p><p>\u201c<i>Owe</i>.\u201d TJ cringes and quickly covers his ears, making Cyrus and Jonah scoff. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry Marty ruined everything.\u201d Buffy says to Andi. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine, we got a good song out of it.\u201d </p><p>Cyrus beams at Jonah after she says this. </p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d TJ asks him.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Yeah, I am.\u201d Cyrus keeps his answer honest. </p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d TJ pats his shoulder, admiring him with the others. </p><p>\u201cI, didn\u2019t want you guys to find out like that, but,\u201d he glances at both TJ and Jonah. \u201cBut, now I\u2019m just glad you know.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWe are too.\u201d Jonah smiles. </p><p>\u201cEh, I kinda knew.\u201d TJ admits. </p><p>The others look at him and snicker. </p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t.\u201d Jonah says.</p><p>\u201cYeah, \u2018cause you\u2019re just that oblivious.\u201d Cyrus teases, cracking them all up. </p><p>\u201cSo the girls already knew?\u201d Jonah asks him.</p><p>\u201cYeah, what can we say, we\u2019re just that special.\u201d Buffy jokes, causing them all to scoff and smile.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d She decides, quickly placing her hand on Cyrus\u2019 back before walking down the sidewalk with Andi and TJ, letting Cyrus and Jonah have their space.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t have to do that&hellip;\u201d Cyrus smiles to him. </p><p>\u201cYes I did.\u201d Jonah keeps it sincere, chuckling along with him and keeping a good eye on him. \u201cYou\u2019re so brave, Cyrus.\u201d</p><p>He grins. \u201cSo are you&hellip;\u201d He gives him a light shove, having them giggle. \u201cThank you. For being a great friend.\u201d </p><p>He smiles at him once more and begins catching up to the others, leaving Jonah smiling through the pain that that last word has brought him as he watches Cyrus in despair. </p><p>Things have already begun to grown so muddled, that he almost can\u2019t feel himself continue forward.</p><p><br/></p><p>That next morning at school before the start of first period, Buffy is still bad mouthing Marty to her peers, who are trying her best to calm her down about the situation. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m never seeing him again. <i>Never</i> ever <i>never</i> ever <i>never.</i>\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou <i>do</i> know you\u2019re on the same basketball team, right? You\u2019re gonna see him during the game.\u201d Andi reminds.</p><p>\u201cBuffy, it\u2019s okay. I\u2019m over it.\u201d Cyrus says. \u201cIt\u2019s not like you confirmed it to him. He has no real proof.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEh&hellip;\u201d TJ doesn\u2019t exactly believe that. </p><p>\u201cExcuse me.\u201d Cyrus asks, he and the others confusingly looking at him. </p><p>\u201cWell I\u2019m just saying&hellip;\u201d TJ doesn\u2019t know how to continue. </p><p>\u201c<i>What</i>.\u201d Cyrus frowns. </p><p>\u201cNothing!\u201d TJ defensively looks at him, the pitch of his voice increasing. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just&hellip;Sometimes you can be a bit\u2014\u201c</p><p>\u201cGay? Well what do you expect?\u201d Cyrus asks him.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know&hellip;\u201d TJ suddenly takes it all back, making Jonah frown and the rest of them roll their eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna talk to Marty after class.\u201d Cyrus states, which has Buffy recoil. \u201c<i>Ugh. </i>My whole morning is ruined now, I\u2019ll see you guys later.\u201d She walks off to class without another word.</p><p>\u201cI still can\u2019t tell if she\u2019s more petty about what he did to <i>me</i>, or what he did to her.\u201d Cyrus brings up.</p><p>\u201cWhat <i>did</i> Marty do to her?\u201d TJ wants to know.</p><p>\u201cNothing, really.\u201d Andi says. \u201cHe told her he liked her, and when she didn\u2019t want to move forward, they just stopped talking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t she want to move forward?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause.\u201d Cyrus starts. \u201cShe\u2019s Buffy.\u201d</p><p>That, she is. </p><p><br/></p><p>After class out in the halls, Cyrus is surprised to see Marty actually approach him.</p><p>\u201cHey man&hellip;\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey&hellip;\u201d Cyrus wishes he knew what to say. </p><p>\u201cUh, I\u2019m <i>so</i> sorry about yesterday. I was terrible. I should\u2019ve kept my mouth shut.\u201d Marty states.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. It\u2019s not like you were using it against me or anything. Besides, you were right. I am gay.\u201d Cyrus explains, returning his smile. </p><p>\u201cYou helped me come out to the guys, so, thanks for that.\u201d He adds.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Marty nods. \u201cYou have my total support, a hundred percent.\u201d </p><p>Cyrus couldn\u2019t be more relieved. </p><p>\u201cBesides, you\u2019re not the only one, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d Cyrus chuckles, thinking Marty is talking about the general world around them. </p><p>\u201cI mean, Jonah did write that paper.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhat&hellip;?\u201d Cyrus asks. </p><p>\u201cYou know, on gay rights. It was pretty moving.\u201d </p><p>Needing a few seconds to respond, Cyrus starts laughing nervously. \u201cYeah, but, that doesn\u2019t mean&hellip;\u201d </p><p><i>Does</i> it? Marty assumed <i>Cyrus</i> was gay, and he was totally right! </p><p>\u201cOh, sorry, I uh, didn\u2019t mean to jump to conclusions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, you\u2019re fine.\u201d Cyrus plasters on a smile, trying to shove away the abrupt conclusions of his own. </p><p>\u201cAnd hey, before you go, do you think\u2014do you think Buffy will ever forgive me&hellip;?\u201d Marty asks.</p><p>Cyrus blinks, tutting lightly and thinking it over. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure she will after she knows you and I are cool. But besides that whole thing, I think you should talk about what happened with you guys in the first place. I know rejection sucks, but, you should at least make ends meet before she leaves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeaves?\u201d Marty\u2019s head begins to spin.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Cyrus flinches at the realization. \u201cYou haven\u2019t heard&hellip;She\u2019s moving away soon with her Mom&hellip;\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>When?</i>\u201d Marty panics.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know when, exactly, but, sometime in the near future.\u201d Cyrus doesn\u2019t know how much longer he can handle looking at his devastated expression. </p><p>\u201cYou should talk to her, Marty.\u201d Cyrus says his last words to him before turning away and separating himself, his mind currently so distracted that it seems like TJ pops out at him from almost nowhere. </p><p>\u201cSo I read Jonah\u2019s paper, and-\u201c</p><p>\u201c<i>What?</i> <i>Dude</i>.\u201d Cyrus was hoping he\u2019d be the one to remain loyal. </p><p>\u201cAnd all I\u2019m saying is <i>no</i> straight guy would write that.\u201d TJ blatantly ignores his interruption.</p><p>\u201cTJ, come on, don\u2019t make assumptions.\u201d Cyrus doesn\u2019t need any of that. </p><p>\u201cWhat? Why not? I\u2019m <i>allowed</i>.\u201d TJ feels personally offended. \u201cI\u2019m just saying, it\u2019s <i>something</i> to think about.\u201d </p><p>Cyrus glances away and exhales anxiously, getting Buffy\u2019s attention after she sees her walking by them in the other direction.</p><p>\u201cBuffy. Marty knows you\u2019re leaving, so he\u2019s probably gonna try and serenade you or something before time\u2019s up.\u201d Him and TJ give her double thumbs up.</p><p>\u201cWhat&hellip;?\u201d She practically squeaks. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine.

I was nervous too. It was kinda my first date.\u201d He admits.</p><p>\u201cThis was a date?\u201d Andi\u2019s ecstatic. </p><p>\u201cYeah! Well, maybe not officially, but, we could have a do-over. Somewhere more\u2026\u201d He looks around to those surrounding them. \u201cPrivate.\u201d </p><p>They all chuckle. </p><p>\u201cYeah, that sounds nice.\u201d Andi says. \u201cUh, before you go\u2026\u201d She properly introduces him to each of them. </p><p>\u201cNice meeting you guys.\u201d He says to them. \u201cBye.\u201d He hugs Andi once more, giving her a huge smile and feeling the rest of them keep watch on him as he walks off. </p><p>Once he\u2019s out of earshot, the guys consider him pretty lucky considering just how much Andi and Buffy are squealing to each other. </p><p>\u201c<i>Owe</i>.\u201d TJ cringes and quickly covers his ears, making Cyrus and Jonah scoff. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry Marty ruined everything.\u201d Buffy says to Andi. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine, we got a good song out of it.\u201d </p><p>Cyrus beams at Jonah after she says this. </p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d TJ asks him.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Yeah, I am.\u201d Cyrus keeps his answer honest. </p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d TJ pats his shoulder, admiring him with the others. </p><p>\u201cI, didn\u2019t want you guys to find out like that, but,\u201d he glances at both TJ and Jonah. \u201cBut, now I\u2019m just glad you know.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWe are too.\u201d Jonah smiles. </p><p>\u201cEh, I kinda knew.\u201d TJ admits. </p><p>The others look at him and snicker. </p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t.\u201d Jonah says.</p><p>\u201cYeah, \u2018cause you\u2019re just that oblivious.\u201d Cyrus teases, cracking them all up. </p><p>\u201cSo the girls already knew?\u201d Jonah asks him.</p><p>\u201cYeah, what can we say, we\u2019re just that special.\u201d Buffy jokes, causing them all to scoff and smile.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d She decides, quickly placing her hand on Cyrus\u2019 back before walking down the sidewalk with Andi and TJ, letting Cyrus and Jonah have their space.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t have to do that\u2026\u201d Cyrus smiles to him. </p><p>\u201cYes I did.\u201d Jonah keeps it sincere, chuckling along with him and keeping a good eye on him. \u201cYou\u2019re so brave, Cyrus.\u201d</p><p>He grins. \u201cSo are you\u2026\u201d He gives him a light shove, having them giggle. \u201cThank you. For being a great friend.\u201d </p><p>He smiles at him once more and begins catching up to the others, leaving Jonah smiling through the pain that that last word has brought him as he watches Cyrus in despair. </p><p>Things have already begun to grown so muddled, that he almost can\u2019t feel himself continue forward.</p><p><br></p><p>That next morning at school before the start of first period, Buffy is still bad mouthing Marty to her peers, who are trying her best to calm her down about the situation. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m never seeing him again. <i>Never</i> ever <i>never</i> ever <i>never.</i>\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou <i>do</i> know you\u2019re on the same basketball team, right? You\u2019re gonna see him during the game.\u201d Andi reminds.</p><p>\u201cBuffy, it\u2019s okay. I\u2019m over it.\u201d Cyrus says. \u201cIt\u2019s not like you confirmed it to him. He has no real proof.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEh\u2026\u201d TJ doesn\u2019t exactly believe that. </p><p>\u201cExcuse me.\u201d Cyrus asks, he and the others confusingly looking at him. </p><p>\u201cWell I\u2019m just saying\u2026\u201d TJ doesn\u2019t know how to continue. </p><p>\u201c<i>What</i>.\u201d Cyrus frowns. </p><p>\u201cNothing!\u201d TJ defensively looks at him, the pitch of his voice increasing. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just\u2026Sometimes you can be a bit\u2014\u201c</p><p>\u201cGay? Well what do you expect?\u201d Cyrus asks him.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026\u201d TJ suddenly takes it all back, making Jonah frown and the rest of them roll their eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna talk to Marty after class.\u201d Cyrus states, which has Buffy recoil. \u201c<i>Ugh. </i>My whole morning is ruined now, I\u2019ll see you guys later.\u201d She walks off to class without another word.</p><p>\u201cI still can\u2019t tell if she\u2019s more petty about what he did to <i>me</i>, or what he did to her.\u201d Cyrus brings up.</p><p>\u201cWhat <i>did</i> Marty do to her?\u201d TJ wants to know.</p><p>\u201cNothing, really.\u201d Andi says. \u201cHe told her he liked her, and when she didn\u2019t want to move forward, they just stopped talking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t she want to move forward?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause.\u201d Cyrus starts. \u201cShe\u2019s Buffy.\u201d</p><p>That, she is. </p><p><br></p><p>After class out in the halls, Cyrus is surprised to see Marty actually approach him.</p><p>\u201cHey man\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey\u2026\u201d Cyrus wishes he knew what to say. </p><p>\u201cUh, I\u2019m <i>so</i> sorry about yesterday. I was terrible. I should\u2019ve kept my mouth shut.\u201d Marty states.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. It\u2019s not like you were using it against me or anything. Besides, you were right. I am gay.\u201d Cyrus explains, returning his smile. </p><p>\u201cYou helped me come out to the guys, so, thanks for that.\u201d He adds.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Marty nods. \u201cYou have my total support, a hundred percent.\u201d </p><p>Cyrus couldn\u2019t be more relieved. </p><p>\u201cBesides, you\u2019re not the only one, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d Cyrus chuckles, thinking Marty is talking about the general world around them. </p><p>\u201cI mean, Jonah did write that paper.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhat\u2026?\u201d Cyrus asks. </p><p>\u201cYou know, on gay rights. It was pretty moving.\u201d </p><p>Needing a few seconds to respond, Cyrus starts laughing nervously. \u201cYeah, but, that doesn\u2019t mean\u2026\u201d </p><p><i>Does</i> it? Marty assumed <i>Cyrus</i> was gay, and he was totally right! </p><p>\u201cOh, sorry, I uh, didn\u2019t mean to jump to conclusions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, you\u2019re fine.\u201d Cyrus plasters on a smile, trying to shove away the abrupt conclusions of his own. </p><p>\u201cAnd hey, before you go, do you think\u2014do you think Buffy will ever forgive me\u2026?\u201d Marty asks.</p><p>Cyrus blinks, tutting lightly and thinking it over. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure she will after she knows you and I are cool. But besides that whole thing, I think you should talk about what happened with you guys in the first place. I know rejection sucks, but, you should at least make ends meet before she leaves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeaves?\u201d Marty\u2019s head begins to spin.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Cyrus flinches at the realization. \u201cYou haven\u2019t heard\u2026She\u2019s moving away soon with her Mom\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>When?</i>\u201d Marty panics.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know when, exactly, but, sometime in the near future.\u201d Cyrus doesn\u2019t know how much longer he can handle looking at his devastated expression. </p><p>\u201cYou should talk to her, Marty.\u201d Cyrus says his last words to him before turning away and separating himself, his mind currently so distracted that it seems like TJ pops out at him from almost nowhere. </p><p>\u201cSo I read Jonah\u2019s paper, and-\u201c</p><p>\u201c<i>What?</i> <i>Dude</i>.\u201d Cyrus was hoping he\u2019d be the one to remain loyal. </p><p>\u201cAnd all I\u2019m saying is <i>no</i> straight guy would write that.\u201d TJ blatantly ignores his interruption.</p><p>\u201cTJ, come on, don\u2019t make assumptions.\u201d Cyrus doesn\u2019t need any of that. </p><p>\u201cWhat? Why not? I\u2019m <i>allowed</i>.\u201d TJ feels personally offended. \u201cI\u2019m just saying, it\u2019s <i>something</i> to think about.\u201d </p><p>Cyrus glances away and exhales anxiously, getting Buffy\u2019s attention after she sees her walking by them in the other direction.</p><p>\u201cBuffy. Marty knows you\u2019re leaving, so he\u2019s probably gonna try and serenade you or something before time\u2019s up.\u201d Him and TJ give her double thumbs up.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2026?\u201d She practically squeaks. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. He and I are cool now.\u201d He lets her know.</p><p>\u201cYeah, well <i>we\u2019re</i> still not.\u201d She claims.</p><p>\u201cBuffy, you <i>do</i> realize that you\u2019re the one who rejected him.\u201d TJ says.</p><p>\u201cWhat? No I <i>wasn\u2019t</i>, <i>what</i> did you tell him??\u201d In complete denial, she goes off directly at Cyrus. </p><p>\u201cNothing\u2026!\u201d </p><p>In response, all she can do is groan and roll her eyes before she stomps away, leaving Cyrus and TJ to look at each other fairly timidly. </p><p><br></p><p>At lunch, TJ seems to care about Gus and Jonah talking more than Cyrus does. By a whole lot. </p><p>Meanwhile, Buffy isn\u2019t very happy about the fact that Cyrus keeps focusing on Marty. </p><p>\u201cCyrus <i>why </i>do you keep looking at him.\u201d She snaps, sitting in-between him and TJ at their table.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s nice, okay\u2026?\u201d Cyrus innocently looks at her.</p><p>\u201cOh <i>please</i>, this is exactly what you did with TJ.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d TJ happens to take offense. \u201cI\u2019m nice now!

Well what do you expect?\u201d Cyrus asks him.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026\u201d TJ suddenly takes it all back, making Jonah frown and the rest of them roll their eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna talk to Marty after class.\u201d Cyrus states, which has Buffy recoil. \u201c<i>Ugh. </i>My whole morning is ruined now, I\u2019ll see you guys later.\u201d She walks off to class without another word.</p><p>\u201cI still can\u2019t tell if she\u2019s more petty about what he did to <i>me</i>, or what he did to her.\u201d Cyrus brings up.</p><p>\u201cWhat <i>did</i> Marty do to her?\u201d TJ wants to know.</p><p>\u201cNothing, really.\u201d Andi says. \u201cHe told her he liked her, and when she didn\u2019t want to move forward, they just stopped talking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t she want to move forward?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause.\u201d Cyrus starts. \u201cShe\u2019s Buffy.\u201d</p><p>That, she is. </p><p><br></p><p>After class out in the halls, Cyrus is surprised to see Marty actually approach him.</p><p>\u201cHey man\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey\u2026\u201d Cyrus wishes he knew what to say. </p><p>\u201cUh, I\u2019m <i>so</i> sorry about yesterday. I was terrible. I should\u2019ve kept my mouth shut.\u201d Marty states.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. It\u2019s not like you were using it against me or anything. Besides, you were right. I am gay.\u201d Cyrus explains, returning his smile. </p><p>\u201cYou helped me come out to the guys, so, thanks for that.\u201d He adds.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Marty nods. \u201cYou have my total support, a hundred percent.\u201d </p><p>Cyrus couldn\u2019t be more relieved. </p><p>\u201cBesides, you\u2019re not the only one, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d Cyrus chuckles, thinking Marty is talking about the general world around them. </p><p>\u201cI mean, Jonah did write that paper.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhat\u2026?\u201d Cyrus asks. </p><p>\u201cYou know, on gay rights. It was pretty moving.\u201d </p><p>Needing a few seconds to respond, Cyrus starts laughing nervously. \u201cYeah, but, that doesn\u2019t mean\u2026\u201d </p><p><i>Does</i> it? Marty assumed <i>Cyrus</i> was gay, and he was totally right! </p><p>\u201cOh, sorry, I uh, didn\u2019t mean to jump to conclusions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, you\u2019re fine.\u201d Cyrus plasters on a smile, trying to shove away the abrupt conclusions of his own. </p><p>\u201cAnd hey, before you go, do you think\u2014do you think Buffy will ever forgive me\u2026?\u201d Marty asks.</p><p>Cyrus blinks, tutting lightly and thinking it over. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure she will after she knows you and I are cool. But besides that whole thing, I think you should talk about what happened with you guys in the first place. I know rejection sucks, but, you should at least make ends meet before she leaves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeaves?\u201d Marty\u2019s head begins to spin.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Cyrus flinches at the realization. \u201cYou haven\u2019t heard\u2026She\u2019s moving away soon with her Mom\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>When?</i>\u201d Marty panics.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know when, exactly, but, sometime in the near future.\u201d Cyrus doesn\u2019t know how much longer he can handle looking at his devastated expression. </p><p>\u201cYou should talk to her, Marty.\u201d Cyrus says his last words to him before turning away and separating himself, his mind currently so distracted that it seems like TJ pops out at him from almost nowhere. </p><p>\u201cSo I read Jonah\u2019s paper, and-\u201c</p><p>\u201c<i>What?</i> <i>Dude</i>.\u201d Cyrus was hoping he\u2019d be the one to remain loyal. </p><p>\u201cAnd all I\u2019m saying is <i>no</i> straight guy would write that.\u201d TJ blatantly ignores his interruption.</p><p>\u201cTJ, come on, don\u2019t make assumptions.\u201d Cyrus doesn\u2019t need any of that. </p><p>\u201cWhat? Why not? I\u2019m <i>allowed</i>.\u201d TJ feels personally offended. \u201cI\u2019m just saying, it\u2019s <i>something</i> to think about.\u201d </p><p>Cyrus glances away and exhales anxiously, getting Buffy\u2019s attention after she sees her walking by them in the other direction.</p><p>\u201cBuffy. Marty knows you\u2019re leaving, so he\u2019s probably gonna try and serenade you or something before time\u2019s up.\u201d Him and TJ give her double thumbs up.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2026?\u201d She practically squeaks. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. He and I are cool now.\u201d He lets her know.</p><p>\u201cYeah, well <i>we\u2019re</i> still not.\u201d She claims.</p><p>\u201cBuffy, you <i>do</i> realize that you\u2019re the one who rejected him.\u201d TJ says.</p><p>\u201cWhat? No I <i>wasn\u2019t</i>, <i>what</i> did you tell him??\u201d In complete denial, she goes off directly at Cyrus. </p><p>\u201cNothing\u2026!\u201d </p><p>In response, all she can do is groan and roll her eyes before she stomps away, leaving Cyrus and TJ to look at each other fairly timidly. </p><p><br></p><p>At lunch, TJ seems to care about Gus and Jonah talking more than Cyrus does. By a whole lot. </p><p>Meanwhile, Buffy isn\u2019t very happy about the fact that Cyrus keeps focusing on Marty. </p><p>\u201cCyrus <i>why </i>do you keep looking at him.\u201d She snaps, sitting in-between him and TJ at their table.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s nice, okay\u2026?\u201d Cyrus innocently looks at her.</p><p>\u201cOh <i>please</i>, this is exactly what you did with TJ.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d TJ happens to take offense. \u201cI\u2019m nice now! And Marty\u2019s always been nice, he\u2019s just acting the way he is now \u2018cause he\u2019s still in love with you.\u201d </p><p>\u201c<i>Ew</i>!\u201d Buffy almost gags. \u201cDon\u2019t say \u2018love\u2019.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Andi asks, right across from her. \u201cLove is a good thing.\u201d </p><p>\u201cMaybe for <i>you.</i>\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah, love is stupid.\u201d TJ decides.</p><p>\u201cWho broke <i>your </i>heart<i>.\u201d </i>Cyrus<i> </i>asks.</p><p>\u201cMyself.\u201d His blunt answer almost makes Andi choke on her milk. </p><p>\u201cHey guys.\u201d Jonah comes up to them and sits down beside Andi.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you keep talking to Gus.\u201d This is TJ\u2019s first question. </p><p>\u201cBecause he\u2019s my acquaintance, and we\u2019re on the same sports team\u2026\u201d Jonah frowns. </p><p>\u201cYeah, so? It\u2019s not even frisbee season, dude.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you <i>sure</i> this has nothing to do with him being ginger?\u201d Jonah can\u2019t help but wonder.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Andi harshly accuses.</p><p>\u201cFor your information, I happen to find gingers <i>very</i> attractive.\u201d </p><p>This brings on a discomforting pause between the five of them, until Cyrus sniffles, and Jonah clears his throat.</p><p>\u201c<i>What.</i>\u201d TJ demands. \u201c<i>What</i>. What are you guys, ginger-phobic? <i>Must</i> I put on the South Park episode again??\u201d He starts to frazzle. </p><p>\u201cNo\u2026\u201d The rest respond both shyly and simultaneously. </p><p>\u201cSo, you think Gus is attractive?\u201d Buffy asks.</p><p>\u201cWhoa Buffy. <i>I\u2019m</i> not the gay one. <i>Cyrus</i> is.\u201d </p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d Cyrus asks. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean <i>I</i> find Gus attractive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTasteless.\u201d TJ says under his breath. </p><p>Overwhelmingly puzzled, others glance at each other with raised eyebrows and shrugged shoulders. </p><p><br></p><p>During after-school practice, with the help of multiple basketballs found in the gym\u2019s storage room, Buffy and TJ let the others get in on the action, which quickly distracts them both from focusing on what they came to do, which was focus for the big game on Friday. </p><p>\u201c<i>Jonah!</i>\u201d</p><p>Jonah wastes no time messing around with Cyrus, lifting him off the ground again and taking away his basketball, making the others slow down from running around and look over in appreciation. </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a foul.\u201d Cyrus giggles.</p><p>\u201c<i>You\u2019re</i> a foul. Just kidding no you\u2019re not.\u201d Jonah grins, the two of them laughing so much that he ends up setting Cyrus down. </p><p>\u201cOhh, he shoots, he scores!\u201d TJ swipes the ball from Jonah, throwing both it and the ball of his own towards the net at the same time, both of them bouncing off the rim and onto the floor. </p><p>This leads them to all try and throw in their various basketballs one by one, giggling excessively and running around the gym like maniacs. </p><p>Again, Jonah grabs Cyrus and pulls him in close, unable to not crack up while jokingly advising him to apologize for \u2018running away from him.\u2019 </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so an<i>noying</i>.\u201d Cyrus smiles, beaming forward and anticipating his reaction. </p><p>\u201cWhat? <i>What?\u201d</i> Jonah repeats himself, pulling Cyrus in by his shoulders and giggling so much into his ear that Cyrus almost falls forward guffawing. </p><p>TJ and the girls would be taking admiration to this, except they\u2019re also too busy playing around and rambunctiously reacting to every single little thing that\u2018s said or done to one another.</p><p>\u201cHold on!\u201d Buffy laughs to TJ and Andi who keep on chasing her around and pestering her with basketballs, coming to a stop and jogging over to the bottom of the bleachers where her phone rings inside her bag. </p><p>\u201cHey, mama.\u201d She answers it, speed walking out of the gym to block out everyone else\u2019s obnoxious noises that grow even louder when TJ and Andi begin a hectic game of one on one, whereas Cyrus and Jonah keep interfering by blocking their shots and getting in their way. After about a minute or so, their antics are put to an end when Buffy makes her dramatic return through the double doors. </p><p>They all stop and look her way, expecting to hear nothing good. </p><p>\u201cBuffy\u2026\u201d Andi almost doesn\u2019t want to hear her say it.</p><p>Yet she does.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m leaving for Indianapolis on Saturday\u2026\u201d</p>",

He has no real proof.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Eh&hellip;&rdquo; TJ doesn&rsquo;t exactly believe that. </p><p>&ldquo;Excuse me.&rdquo; Cyrus asks, he and the others confusingly looking at him. </p><p>&ldquo;Well I&rsquo;m just saying&hellip;&rdquo; TJ doesn&rsquo;t know how to continue. </p><p>&ldquo;<i>What</i>.&rdquo; Cyrus frowns. </p><p>&ldquo;Nothing!&rdquo; TJ defensively looks at him, the pitch of his voice increasing. </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just&hellip;Sometimes you can be a bit&mdash;&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Gay? Well what do you expect?&rdquo; Cyrus asks him.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&hellip;&rdquo; TJ suddenly takes it all back, making Jonah frown and the rest of them roll their eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m gonna talk to Marty after class.&rdquo; Cyrus states, which has Buffy recoil. &ldquo;<i>Ugh. </i>My whole morning is ruined now, I&rsquo;ll see you guys later.&rdquo; She walks off to class without another word.</p><p>&ldquo;I still can&rsquo;t tell if she&rsquo;s more petty about what he did to <i>me</i>, or what he did to her.&rdquo; Cyrus brings up.</p><p>&ldquo;What <i>did</i> Marty do to her?&rdquo; TJ wants to know.</p><p>&ldquo;Nothing, really.&rdquo; Andi says. &ldquo;He told her he liked her, and when she didn&rsquo;t want to move forward, they just stopped talking.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t she want to move forward?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Because.&rdquo; Cyrus starts. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s Buffy.&rdquo;</p><p>That, she is. </p><p><br /></p><p>After class out in the halls, Cyrus is surprised to see Marty actually approach him.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey man&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hey&hellip;&rdquo; Cyrus wishes he knew what to say. </p><p>&ldquo;Uh, I&rsquo;m <i>so</i> sorry about yesterday. I was terrible. I should&rsquo;ve kept my mouth shut.&rdquo; Marty states.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay. It&rsquo;s not like you were using it against me or anything. Besides, you were right. I am gay.&rdquo; Cyrus explains, returning his smile. </p><p>&ldquo;You helped me come out to the guys, so, thanks for that.&rdquo; He adds.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo; Marty nods. &ldquo;You have my total support, a hundred percent.&rdquo; </p><p>Cyrus couldn&rsquo;t be more relieved. </p><p>&ldquo;Besides, you&rsquo;re not the only one, right?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nope.&rdquo; Cyrus chuckles, thinking Marty is talking about the general world around them. </p><p>&ldquo;I mean, Jonah did write that paper.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;What&hellip;?&rdquo; Cyrus asks. </p><p>&ldquo;You know, on gay rights. It was pretty moving.&rdquo; </p><p>Needing a few seconds to respond, Cyrus starts laughing nervously. &ldquo;Yeah, but, that doesn&rsquo;t mean&hellip;&rdquo; </p><p><i>Does</i> it? Marty assumed <i>Cyrus</i> was gay, and he was totally right! </p><p>&ldquo;Oh, sorry, I uh, didn&rsquo;t mean to jump to conclusions.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, no, you&rsquo;re fine.&rdquo; Cyrus plasters on a smile, trying to shove away the abrupt conclusions of his own. </p><p>&ldquo;And hey, before you go, do you think&mdash;do you think Buffy will ever forgive me&hellip;?&rdquo; Marty asks.</p><p>Cyrus blinks, tutting lightly and thinking it over. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure she will after she knows you and I are cool. But besides that whole thing, I think you should talk about what happened with you guys in the first place. I know rejection sucks, but, you should at least make ends meet before she leaves.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Leaves?&rdquo; Marty&rsquo;s head begins to spin.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh.&rdquo; Cyrus flinches at the realization. &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t heard&hellip;She&rsquo;s moving away soon with her Mom&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;<i>When?</i>&rdquo; Marty panics.</p><p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know when, exactly, but, sometime in the near future.&rdquo; Cyrus doesn&rsquo;t know how much longer he can handle looking at his devastated expression. </p><p>&ldquo;You should talk to her, Marty.&rdquo; Cyrus says his last words to him before turning away and separating himself, his mind currently so distracted that it seems like TJ pops out at him from almost nowhere. </p><p>&ldquo;So I read Jonah&rsquo;s paper, and-&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;<i>What?</i> <i>Dude</i>.&rdquo; Cyrus was hoping he&rsquo;d be the one to remain loyal. </p><p>&ldquo;And all I&rsquo;m saying is <i>no</i> straight guy would write that.&rdquo; TJ blatantly ignores his interruption.</p><p>&ldquo;TJ, come on, don&rsquo;t make assumptions.&rdquo; Cyrus doesn&rsquo;t need any of that. </p><p>&ldquo;What? Why not? I&rsquo;m <i>allowed</i>.&rdquo; TJ feels personally offended. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just saying, it&rsquo;s <i>something</i> to think about.&rdquo; </p><p>Cyrus glances away and exhales anxiously, getting Buffy&rsquo;s attention after she sees her walking by them in the other direction.</p><p>&ldquo;Buffy. Marty knows you&rsquo;re leaving, so he&rsquo;s probably gonna try and serenade you or something before time&rsquo;s up.&rdquo; Him and TJ give her double thumbs up.</p><p>&ldquo;What&hellip;?&rdquo; She practically squeaks. </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine. He and I are cool now.&rdquo; He lets her know.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, well <i>we&rsquo;re</i> still not.&rdquo; She claims.</p><p>&ldquo;Buffy, you <i>do</i> realize that you&rsquo;re the one who rejected him.&rdquo; TJ says.</p><p>&ldquo;What? No I <i>wasn&rsquo;t</i>, <i>what</i> did you tell him??&rdquo; In complete denial, she goes off directly at Cyrus. </p><p>&ldquo;Nothing&hellip;!&rdquo; </p><p>In response, all she can do is groan and roll her eyes before she stomps away, leaving Cyrus and TJ to look at each other fairly timidly. </p><p><br /></p><p>At lunch, TJ seems to care about Gus and Jonah talking more than Cyrus does. By a whole lot. </p><p>Meanwhile, Buffy isn&rsquo;t very happy about the fact that Cyrus keeps focusing on Marty. </p><p>&ldquo;Cyrus <i>why </i>do you keep looking at him.&rdquo; She snaps, sitting in-between him and TJ at their table.</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s nice, okay&hellip;?&rdquo; Cyrus innocently looks at her.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh <i>please</i>, this is exactly what you did with TJ.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hey!&rdquo; TJ happens to take offense. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m nice now! And Marty&rsquo;s always been nice, he&rsquo;s just acting the way he is now &lsquo;cause he&rsquo;s still in love with you.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;<i>Ew</i>!&rdquo; Buffy almost gags. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say &lsquo;love&rsquo;.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; Andi asks, right across from her. &ldquo;Love is a good thing.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Maybe for <i>you.</i>&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, love is stupid.&rdquo; TJ decides.</p><p>&ldquo;Who broke <i>your </i>heart<i>.&rdquo; </i>Cyrus<i> </i>asks.</p><p>&ldquo;Myself.&rdquo; His blunt answer almost makes Andi choke on her milk. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey guys.&rdquo; Jonah comes up to them and sits down beside Andi.</p><p>&ldquo;Why do you keep talking to Gus.&rdquo; This is TJ&rsquo;s first question. </p><p>&ldquo;Because he&rsquo;s my acquaintance, and we&rsquo;re on the same sports team&hellip;&rdquo; Jonah frowns. </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, so? It&rsquo;s not even frisbee season, dude.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Are you <i>sure</i> this has nothing to do with him being ginger?&rdquo; Jonah can&rsquo;t help but wonder.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo; Andi harshly accuses.</p><p>&ldquo;For your information, I happen to find gingers <i>very</i> attractive.&rdquo; </p><p>This brings on a discomforting pause between the five of them, until Cyrus sniffles, and Jonah clears his throat.</p><p>&ldquo;<i>What.</i>&rdquo; TJ demands. &ldquo;<i>What</i>. What are you guys, ginger-phobic? <i>Must</i> I put on the South Park episode again??&rdquo; He starts to frazzle. </p><p>&ldquo;No&hellip;&rdquo; The rest respond both shyly and simultaneously. </p><p>&ldquo;So, you think Gus is attractive?&rdquo; Buffy asks.</p><p>&ldquo;Whoa Buffy. <i>I&rsquo;m</i> not the gay one. <i>Cyrus</i> is.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;So?&rdquo; Cyrus asks. &ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t mean <i>I</i> find Gus attractive.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Tasteless.&rdquo; TJ says under his breath. </p><p>Overwhelmingly puzzled, others glance at each other with raised eyebrows and shrugged shoulders. </p><p><br /></p><p>During after-school practice, with the help of multiple basketballs found in the gym&rsquo;s storage room, Buffy and TJ let the others get in on the action, which quickly distracts them both from focusing on what they came to do, which was focus for the big game on Friday. </p><p>&ldquo;<i>Jonah!</i>&rdquo;</p><p>Jonah wastes no time messing around with Cyrus, lifting him off the ground again and taking away his basketball, making the others slow down from running around and look over in appreciation. </p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a foul.&rdquo; Cyrus giggles.</p><p>&ldquo;<i>You&rsquo;re</i> a foul. Just kidding no you&rsquo;re not.&rdquo; Jonah grins, the two of them laughing so much that he ends up setting Cyrus down. </p><p>&ldquo;Ohh, he shoots, he scores!&rdquo; TJ swipes the ball from Jonah, throwing both it and the ball of his own towards the net at the same time, both of them bouncing off the rim and onto the floor. </p><p>This leads them to all try and throw in their various basketballs one by one, giggling excessively and running around the gym like maniacs. </p><p>Again, Jonah grabs Cyrus and pulls him in close, unable to not crack up while jokingly advising him to apologize for &lsquo;running away from him.&rsquo; </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re so an<i>noying</i>.&rdquo; Cyrus smiles, beaming forward and anticipating his reaction. </p><p>&ldquo;What? <i>What?&rdquo;</i> Jonah repeats himself, pulling Cyrus in by his shoulders and giggling so much into his ear that Cyrus almost falls forward guffawing. </p><p>TJ and the girls would be taking admiration to this, except they&rsquo;re also too busy playing around and rambunctiously reacting to every single little thing that&lsquo;s said or done to one another.</p><p>&ldquo;Hold on!&rdquo; Buffy laughs to TJ and Andi who keep on chasing her around and pestering her with basketballs, coming to a stop and jogging over to the bottom of the bleachers where her phone rings inside her bag. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey, mama.&rdquo; She answers it, speed walking out of the gym to block out everyone else&rsquo;s obnoxious noises that grow even louder when TJ and Andi begin a hectic game of one on one, whereas Cyrus and Jonah keep interfering by blocking their shots and getting in their way. After about a minute or so, their antics are put to an end when Buffy makes her dramatic return through the double doors. </p><p>They all stop and look her way, expecting to hear nothing good. </p><p>&ldquo;Buffy&hellip;&rdquo; Andi almost doesn&rsquo;t want to hear her say it.</p><p>Yet she does.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m leaving for Indianapolis on Saturday&hellip;&rdquo;</p>",
