After the Chitauri had invaded New York, you, unlike most other New Yorkers, you ran towards the danger. Your previous combat experience made fighting the impending army slightly easier, using discarded weapons and make shift ones, you were able to save a few lives the day the Chitauri had invaded. Once the Avengers has arrived you knew that the world was in safe hands, following evacuation procedures you let Earth\u2019s Mightiest Heroes take over from their. After the invasion had been dramatically handled, you were approached by Nick Fury and Maria Hill, with a very interesting offer.</p><p>Just a few weeks later you were S.H.I.E.L.D\u2019s newest agent. You found yourself quickly rising in ranks. In field work, intelligence, reconnaissance, you name it. You truly had made yourself known to S.H.I.E.L.D. After the Avengers had returned from Sokovia, Nick Fury had decided it was time for you to move on from S.H.I.E.L.D. Into something better fitting for someone of your abilities. You had joined the Avengers Initiative, or at least the second phase. Alongside Wanda Maximoff, Sam Wilson, Vision, and Colonel Rhodes you went through the training regimen that the Earth\u2019s heroes before you had gone through. This time around not being as much of a walk in the park. You were introduce to enhanced humans, people with far superior combat skills of your own, and intelligence far beyond your own understanding. However you were never one to shy away from a challenge, and you definitely were not one for failing one either.</p><p>After many months of an intense training regimen, you finally felt like you had earned the title of an Avenger. You\u2019re combat skills had greatly increased, you may not have had powers like Wanda, or a suit like Rhodes, but you easily matched them in hand to hand, very much so that you ranked up with Natasha, Clint, Steve, and Bucky. You had been trained to take torture and pain in a way you never had been able to in the past. That part of training wasn\u2019t as fun. You had even had your mental and emotional strength heightened significantly. One of your favorite things to do was hang around with Clint, you quickly picked up archery, which greatly improved your hand-eye coordination. You became quite capable of firing multiple arrows in a few seconds, with extreme accuracy and the ability to directly hit small targets in the greatest of distances. </p><p>Aside from a total re-imaging of yourself, you had also managed to find love. Not the type of high school sweetheart love, the type of love you wouldn\u2019t just die for, or even the type that you would kill for. No, the love you had for Wanda was the type of love you\u2019d live for. Wanda and yourself had become quite close during your training days. You would tell her stories of your past, of your family, of growing up in New York, and she would do the same. You felt like you knew Pietro just through the stories that Wanda told you. Even if you had never been to Sokovia, you could imagine walking down a street just from the way she depicted the country to you. </p><p><br/></p><p><i><b>Present Day</b></i></p><p><br/></p><p>It wasn\u2019t suppose to happen like this, it was supposed to be a simple reconnaissance mission. <i>In and out. </i>No one was supposed to get hurt, no one was supposed to die for that matter. </p><p><br/></p><p>Yet here you were, covered in your comrades blood, a bullet itself lodged in your lower abdomen. Still you had to keep moving, <i>anywhere</i>. You had to find some sort of cover from the constant fire of no doubt an AR-15 rifle. <i>Many of them by the sounds of the fire rate. </i>The sound of empty bullet cartridges and tanks exploding ringing against your eardrums only made the pain worse. You could feel the blood loss from your abdomen becoming exponential, no doubt you would pass out soon.</p><p><br/></p><p><b><i>Twenty Two Hours Earlier</i></b></p><p><br/></p><p>The ride to Athens was quite brief despite it being a long trip from New York. Everyone had gone about their respective pre-mission rituals onboard the quinjet. Clint and yourself made sure you both had a wide variety of trick and normal arrows. Tony and Rhodes both were making adjustments on their suits, making sure they had full power and all weapons systems were online. Sam was tinkering with one of many of Falcon\u2019s gadgets. While Captain Rogers and Wanda adjusted their respected super suits. It didn\u2019t take much long for them to touch down after that.</p><p><br/></p><p>As soon as they had touched down everyone prepared themselves for what would be on the other side of the door ; what they found surprised them. It wasn\u2019t dark or gloomy at all, in fact it was light outside and surrounded by meadows of grass. Coming back from all the apparent shock, Steve began giving out orders.</p><p>\u201c Alright ; Rhodes, Wilson, (y/l/n), stay outside in case anything goes wrong. Wilson try and lay down some air support to sweep the peremeter. Stark, Romanoff, Barton, and Maximoff you\u2019re with me on the inside.

Sam had taken to the sky to sweep the peremeter as Steve had asked, yourself and Rhodes remained by the jet while the other operatives found spots to hide in case. You pulled a regular arrow from your quiver arming your bow as you paced around the exterior of the building. </p><p><br/></p><p>Minutes passed before anyone came over the comms. It was Sam with a status report. </p><p>\u201c No one around the peremeter for hundreds of miles. Rhodes, (y/l/n) you guys see anything? \u201c came Sam\u2019s voice through the comms.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201c Nothing over here. \u201c Came Rhodes bores reply.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201c Same. \u201c you had kept the bow armed as you scanned your surroundings, still something caught your attention. A beeping sound, barely audible but to someone with sharpened senses it was. You followed the noise towards a tank that had no doubt been un-occupied, the closer you got the strong the smell of burnt toast became prevelant.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201c Wait a second, guys. \u201c you knew the smell, but you couldn\u2019t put your finger on it.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201c What? \u201c came Steve\u2019s somewhat annoyed reply.</p><p><br/></p><p>Before you could reply it clicked in your head, you couldn\u2019t think about talking only getting away from the tank, you quickly changed directions barely getting five steps in before the tanks burst into flames with black smoke going everywhere. You had dropped your bow when the blast had knocked you forward a few feet, metal from the tank had managed to slice a couple cuts in your back and face.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201c (y/n), what was that?! \u201c Wanda cried over the comms. \u201c (y/n)?! \u201c</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201c I\u2019m fine, but I don\u2019t think this base is as abandon as we thought it\u2019d be. \u201c picking up your bow you heard the sound of gun fire coming from multiple directions. You didn\u2019t need the comms to hear they were coming from inside as well.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201c Multiple bogeys approaching from all directions, I don\u2019t know where the hell they came from. \u201c Sam came over the comms frantically.</p><p><br/></p><p>Everyone had already discovered that it was a trap, everyone was being attacked by the masked Hydra agents. </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201c It doesn\u2019t matter, get the prints and let\u2019s get the hell out of here. Barton, get back to the jet and prepare for lift off. \u201c Steve ordered out before cutting off the link to the comms. This was the part where all conversation stopped. </p><p><br/></p><p>The S.H.I.E.L.D operatives moved from their cover spots to return fire in the other direction, within seconds many of them were already being riddled with bullets. It was like something out of a movie, the blood splattered against the ground and other people, you could see the bullets lodged into the corpses on the ground.</p><p><br/></p><p>Quickly finding cover behind another tank, you made sure it wasn\u2019t ticking before squatting near it. You did your best to pull the agents with flesh wounds behind some type of cover before reemerging in the fight yourself. You quickly armed your bow with an explosive arrow, firing it in the direction of the agents. The explosion on impact caused many of them to go flying into other objects.</p><p>Rhodes and Wilson were in the air while you were on the ground with the rest of the operatives. You were easily outnumbered, but it was better then outside than inside. You used a bola arrow to ensnare two men before injecting them both with a syringe arrow containing 200 milligrams of tranquilizer, enough to keep them out for hours. You pulled out as many trial arrows as you could to keep the fighting outside. You used a fireworks arrow to blind a few of the agents and even burn, you used a tear gas arrow to break up the clusters of agents, and even resorted to incendiary arrows.</p><p><br/></p><p>It wasn\u2019t long before you found yourself running low on arrows, you even resorted to re-using ones from already down enemies. Careful to keep arrows in your quiver you began using your bow as a melee weapon, it was more efficient in terms of how many people you could take on. </p><p><br/></p><p>The fighting seemed to last forever, you eventually found yourself pinned down unable to reach your bow, moments before what felt like the end of your life, Steve slammed the weight of his body into the man that had been moments ago ready to shoot you. He quickly disarmed the Hydra agent before turning towards you. Out of the corner of your eye you noticed another one moving towards Steve, you quickly threw yourself at him pushing his frame out of the way just seconds after the bullet had been fired from its chamber. With both of you falling to the ground, it left you at a moments weakness, and soon you found yourself not being able to get back up. You had felt the bullet rip through your abdomen, and could tell that it had became lodged in your left lumbar. For being shot it really felt like having all the wind knocked out of you, except it hurt a hell of a lot more. </p><p><br/></p><p>Steve quickly disarmed the assailant before knocking him unconscious, his attention turning towards you. Pulling you behind a tank for cover he turned his attention to your wound.</p><p>\u201c (y/l/n ) oh my god. \u201c Steve thought quickly before approaching a corpse and quickly ripping the shirt from the body so he could us it to press against the wound to keep blood loss to a minimum. Out of the corner of my eye I could see Rhodes land in front of us to protect us from any oncoming threat.</p><p><br/></p><p><b><i>Wanda\u2019s POV</i></b></p><p><br/></p><p>You had been on the inside fighting with Clint by your side, he\u2019d fire an arrow and you\u2019d force enemies back with an assortment of your telekinesis and psionic abilities. It almost seemed as if the Hydra operatives were afraid to approach the pair, even though she knew that wasn\u2019t true. </p><p><br/></p><p>However the feeling of smug-ness would soon wear off, something changed within herself, she felt her connection to (y/n) sever slightly, but she knew what this was, it was the same thing she felt when Pietro died. It was like she could feel the bullet in her own body. Her temper quickly began to rise as she expelled psionic energy from her body causing the remaining Hydra agents to fall. </p><p><br/></p><p>Clint continued advancing until the building with Natasha looking for the prints but you knew you needed to get to (y/n). You broke out into a sprint out of the base, crippling anyone that got in your way. </p><p><br/></p><p>Once you got outside you saw that Rhodes, Sam, and Steve were all keeping the fight outside, you quickly glance the battlefield for the love of your life. It didn\u2019t take long for you to locate her behind a tank, you quickly raced to her dripping down to your knees next to her. </p><p><br/></p><p><b><i>(Y/N) POV </i></b></p><p><br/></p><p>You opened your eyes when you felt a body drop next to you, and for a moment you thought that maybe you had died and gone to heaven, and this was an angel, but it proved to be wrong when you noticed the fighting still going on around you.

After the Chitauri had invaded New York, you, unlike most other New Yorkers, you ran towards the danger. Your previous combat experience made fighting the impending army slightly easier, using discarded weapons and make shift ones, you were able to save a few lives the day the Chitauri had invaded. Once the Avengers has arrived you knew that the world was in safe hands, following evacuation procedures you let Earth\u2019s Mightiest Heroes take over from their. After the invasion had been dramatically handled, you were approached by Nick Fury and Maria Hill, with a very interesting offer.</p><p>Just a few weeks later you were S.H.I.E.L.D\u2019s newest agent. You found yourself quickly rising in ranks. In field work, intelligence, reconnaissance, you name it. You truly had made yourself known to S.H.I.E.L.D. After the Avengers had returned from Sokovia, Nick Fury had decided it was time for you to move on from S.H.I.E.L.D. Into something better fitting for someone of your abilities. You had joined the Avengers Initiative, or at least the second phase. Alongside Wanda Maximoff, Sam Wilson, Vision, and Colonel Rhodes you went through the training regimen that the Earth\u2019s heroes before you had gone through. This time around not being as much of a walk in the park. You were introduce to enhanced humans, people with far superior combat skills of your own, and intelligence far beyond your own understanding. However you were never one to shy away from a challenge, and you definitely were not one for failing one either.</p><p>After many months of an intense training regimen, you finally felt like you had earned the title of an Avenger. You\u2019re combat skills had greatly increased, you may not have had powers like Wanda, or a suit like Rhodes, but you easily matched them in hand to hand, very much so that you ranked up with Natasha, Clint, Steve, and Bucky. You had been trained to take torture and pain in a way you never had been able to in the past. That part of training wasn\u2019t as fun. You had even had your mental and emotional strength heightened significantly. One of your favorite things to do was hang around with Clint, you quickly picked up archery, which greatly improved your hand-eye coordination. You became quite capable of firing multiple arrows in a few seconds, with extreme accuracy and the ability to directly hit small targets in the greatest of distances. </p><p>Aside from a total re-imaging of yourself, you had also managed to find love. Not the type of high school sweetheart love, the type of love you wouldn\u2019t just die for, or even the type that you would kill for. No, the love you had for Wanda was the type of love you\u2019d live for. Wanda and yourself had become quite close during your training days. You would tell her stories of your past, of your family, of growing up in New York, and she would do the same. You felt like you knew Pietro just through the stories that Wanda told you. Even if you had never been to Sokovia, you could imagine walking down a street just from the way she depicted the country to you. </p><p><br></p><p><i><b>Present Day</b></i></p><p><br></p><p>It wasn\u2019t suppose to happen like this, it was supposed to be a simple reconnaissance mission. <i>In and out. </i>No one was supposed to get hurt, no one was supposed to die for that matter. </p><p><br></p><p>Yet here you were, covered in your comrades blood, a bullet itself lodged in your lower abdomen. Still you had to keep moving, <i>anywhere</i>. You had to find some sort of cover from the constant fire of no doubt an AR-15 rifle. <i>Many of them by the sounds of the fire rate. </i>The sound of empty bullet cartridges and tanks exploding ringing against your eardrums only made the pain worse. You could feel the blood loss from your abdomen becoming exponential, no doubt you would pass out soon.</p><p><br></p><p><b><i>Twenty Two Hours Earlier</i></b></p><p><br></p><p>The ride to Athens was quite brief despite it being a long trip from New York. Everyone had gone about their respective pre-mission rituals onboard the quinjet. Clint and yourself made sure you both had a wide variety of trick and normal arrows. Tony and Rhodes both were making adjustments on their suits, making sure they had full power and all weapons systems were online. Sam was tinkering with one of many of Falcon\u2019s gadgets. While Captain Rogers and Wanda adjusted their respected super suits. It didn\u2019t take much long for them to touch down after that.</p><p><br></p><p>As soon as they had touched down everyone prepared themselves for what would be on the other side of the door ; what they found surprised them. It wasn\u2019t dark or gloomy at all, in fact it was light outside and surrounded by meadows of grass. Coming back from all the apparent shock, Steve began giving out orders.</p><p>\u201c Alright ; Rhodes, Wilson, (y/l/n), stay outside in case anything goes wrong. Wilson try and lay down some air support to sweep the peremeter. Stark, Romanoff, Barton, and Maximoff you\u2019re with me on the inside. We will take half the S.H.I.E.L.D operatives with us, the other half stay out here. \u201c with a final group nod everyone went in their respective ways. </p><p><br></p><p>You watched Wanda until the building consumed her figure and you could no longer see her.

After the Chitauri had invaded New York, you, unlike most other New Yorkers, you ran towards the danger. Your previous combat experience made fighting the impending army slightly easier, using discarded weapons and make shift ones, you were able to save a few lives the day the Chitauri had invaded. Once the Avengers has arrived you knew that the world was in safe hands, following evacuation procedures you let Earth\u2019s Mightiest Heroes take over from their. After the invasion had been dramatically handled, you were approached by Nick Fury and Maria Hill, with a very interesting offer.</p><p>Just a few weeks later you were S.H.I.E.L.D\u2019s newest agent. You found yourself quickly rising in ranks. In field work, intelligence, reconnaissance, you name it. You truly had made yourself known to S.H.I.E.L.D. After the Avengers had returned from Sokovia, Nick Fury had decided it was time for you to move on from S.H.I.E.L.D. Into something better fitting for someone of your abilities. You had joined the Avengers Initiative, or at least the second phase. Alongside Wanda Maximoff, Sam Wilson, Vision, and Colonel Rhodes you went through the training regimen that the Earth\u2019s heroes before you had gone through. This time around not being as much of a walk in the park. You were introduce to enhanced humans, people with far superior combat skills of your own, and intelligence far beyond your own understanding. However you were never one to shy away from a challenge, and you definitely were not one for failing one either.</p><p>After many months of an intense training regimen, you finally felt like you had earned the title of an Avenger. You\u2019re combat skills had greatly increased, you may not have had powers like Wanda, or a suit like Rhodes, but you easily matched them in hand to hand, very much so that you ranked up with Natasha, Clint, Steve, and Bucky. You had been trained to take torture and pain in a way you never had been able to in the past. That part of training wasn\u2019t as fun. You had even had your mental and emotional strength heightened significantly. One of your favorite things to do was hang around with Clint, you quickly picked up archery, which greatly improved your hand-eye coordination. You became quite capable of firing multiple arrows in a few seconds, with extreme accuracy and the ability to directly hit small targets in the greatest of distances. </p><p>Aside from a total re-imaging of yourself, you had also managed to find love. Not the type of high school sweetheart love, the type of love you wouldn\u2019t just die for, or even the type that you would kill for. No, the love you had for Wanda was the type of love you\u2019d live for. Wanda and yourself had become quite close during your training days. You would tell her stories of your past, of your family, of growing up in New York, and she would do the same. You felt like you knew Pietro just through the stories that Wanda told you. Even if you had never been to Sokovia, you could imagine walking down a street just from the way she depicted the country to you. </p><p><br></p><p><i><b>Present Day</b></i></p><p><br></p><p>It wasn\u2019t suppose to happen like this, it was supposed to be a simple reconnaissance mission. <i>In and out. </i>No one was supposed to get hurt, no one was supposed to die for that matter. </p><p><br></p><p>Yet here you were, covered in your comrades blood, a bullet itself lodged in your lower abdomen. Still you had to keep moving, <i>anywhere</i>. You had to find some sort of cover from the constant fire of no doubt an AR-15 rifle. <i>Many of them by the sounds of the fire rate. </i>The sound of empty bullet cartridges and tanks exploding ringing against your eardrums only made the pain worse. You could feel the blood loss from your abdomen becoming exponential, no doubt you would pass out soon.</p><p><br></p><p><b><i>Twenty Two Hours Earlier</i></b></p><p><br></p><p>The ride to Athens was quite brief despite it being a long trip from New York. Everyone had gone about their respective pre-mission rituals onboard the quinjet. Clint and yourself made sure you both had a wide variety of trick and normal arrows. Tony and Rhodes both were making adjustments on their suits, making sure they had full power and all weapons systems were online. Sam was tinkering with one of many of Falcon\u2019s gadgets. While Captain Rogers and Wanda adjusted their respected super suits. It didn\u2019t take much long for them to touch down after that.</p><p><br></p><p>As soon as they had touched down everyone prepared themselves for what would be on the other side of the door ; what they found surprised them. It wasn\u2019t dark or gloomy at all, in fact it was light outside and surrounded by meadows of grass. Coming back from all the apparent shock, Steve began giving out orders.</p><p>\u201c Alright ; Rhodes, Wilson, (y/l/n), stay outside in case anything goes wrong. Wilson try and lay down some air support to sweep the peremeter. Stark, Romanoff, Barton, and Maximoff you\u2019re with me on the inside. We will take half the S.H.I.E.L.D operatives with us, the other half stay out here. \u201c with a final group nod everyone went in their respective ways. </p><p><br></p><p>You watched Wanda until the building consumed her figure and you could no longer see her. Sam had taken to the sky to sweep the peremeter as Steve had asked, yourself and Rhodes remained by the jet while the other operatives found spots to hide in case. You pulled a regular arrow from your quiver arming your bow as you paced around the exterior of the building. </p><p><br></p><p>Minutes passed before anyone came over the comms. It was Sam with a status report. </p><p>\u201c No one around the peremeter for hundreds of miles. Rhodes, (y/l/n) you guys see anything? \u201c came Sam\u2019s voice through the comms.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201c Nothing over here. \u201c Came Rhodes bores reply.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201c Same. \u201c you had kept the bow armed as you scanned your surroundings, still something caught your attention. A beeping sound, barely audible but to someone with sharpened senses it was. You followed the noise towards a tank that had no doubt been un-occupied, the closer you got the strong the smell of burnt toast became prevelant.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201c Wait a second, guys. \u201c you knew the smell, but you couldn\u2019t put your finger on it.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201c What? \u201c came Steve\u2019s somewhat annoyed reply.</p><p><br></p><p>Before you could reply it clicked in your head, you couldn\u2019t think about talking only getting away from the tank, you quickly changed directions barely getting five steps in before the tanks burst into flames with black smoke going everywhere. You had dropped your bow when the blast had knocked you forward a few feet, metal from the tank had managed to slice a couple cuts in your back and face.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201c (y/n), what was that?! \u201c Wanda cried over the comms. \u201c (y/n)?! \u201c</p><p><br></p><p>\u201c I\u2019m fine, but I don\u2019t think this base is as abandon as we thought it\u2019d be. \u201c picking up your bow you heard the sound of gun fire coming from multiple directions. You didn\u2019t need the comms to hear they were coming from inside as well.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201c Multiple bogeys approaching from all directions, I don\u2019t know where the hell they came from. \u201c Sam came over the comms frantically.</p><p><br></p><p>Everyone had already discovered that it was a trap, everyone was being attacked by the masked Hydra agents. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201c It doesn\u2019t matter, get the prints and let\u2019s get the hell out of here. Barton, get back to the jet and prepare for lift off. \u201c Steve ordered out before cutting off the link to the comms. This was the part where all conversation stopped. </p><p><br></p><p>The S.H.I.E.L.D operatives moved from their cover spots to return fire in the other direction, within seconds many of them were already being riddled with bullets. It was like something out of a movie, the blood splattered against the ground and other people, you could see the bullets lodged into the corpses on the ground.</p><p><br></p><p>Quickly finding cover behind another tank, you made sure it wasn\u2019t ticking before squatting near it. You did your best to pull the agents with flesh wounds behind some type of cover before reemerging in the fight yourself. You quickly armed your bow with an explosive arrow, firing it in the direction of the agents. The explosion on impact caused many of them to go flying into other objects.</p><p>Rhodes and Wilson were in the air while you were on the ground with the rest of the operatives. You were easily outnumbered, but it was better then outside than inside. You used a bola arrow to ensnare two men before injecting them both with a syringe arrow containing 200 milligrams of tranquilizer, enough to keep them out for hours. You pulled out as many trial arrows as you could to keep the fighting outside. You used a fireworks arrow to blind a few of the agents and even burn, you used a tear gas arrow to break up the clusters of agents, and even resorted to incendiary arrows.</p><p><br></p><p>It wasn\u2019t long before you found yourself running low on arrows, you even resorted to re-using ones from already down enemies. Careful to keep arrows in your quiver you began using your bow as a melee weapon, it was more efficient in terms of how many people you could take on. </p><p><br></p><p>The fighting seemed to last forever, you eventually found yourself pinned down unable to reach your bow, moments before what felt like the end of your life, Steve slammed the weight of his body into the man that had been moments ago ready to shoot you. He quickly disarmed the Hydra agent before turning towards you. Out of the corner of your eye you noticed another one moving towards Steve, you quickly threw yourself at him pushing his frame out of the way just seconds after the bullet had been fired from its chamber. With both of you falling to the ground, it left you at a moments weakness, and soon you found yourself not being able to get back up. You had felt the bullet rip through your abdomen, and could tell that it had became lodged in your left lumbar. For being shot it really felt like having all the wind knocked out of you, except it hurt a hell of a lot more. </p><p><br></p><p>Steve quickly disarmed the assailant before knocking him unconscious, his attention turning towards you. Pulling you behind a tank for cover he turned his attention to your wound.</p><p>\u201c (y/l/n ) oh my god. \u201c Steve thought quickly before approaching a corpse and quickly ripping the shirt from the body so he could us it to press against the wound to keep blood loss to a minimum. Out of the corner of my eye I could see Rhodes land in front of us to protect us from any oncoming threat.</p><p><br></p><p><b><i>Wanda\u2019s POV</i></b></p><p><br></p><p>You had been on the inside fighting with Clint by your side, he\u2019d fire an arrow and you\u2019d force enemies back with an assortment of your telekinesis and psionic abilities. It almost seemed as if the Hydra operatives were afraid to approach the pair, even though she knew that wasn\u2019t true. </p><p><br></p><p>However the feeling of smug-ness would soon wear off, something changed within herself, she felt her connection to (y/n) sever slightly, but she knew what this was, it was the same thing she felt when Pietro died. It was like she could feel the bullet in her own body. Her temper quickly began to rise as she expelled psionic energy from her body causing the remaining Hydra agents to fall. </p><p><br></p><p>Clint continued advancing until the building with Natasha looking for the prints but you knew you needed to get to (y/n). You broke out into a sprint out of the base, crippling anyone that got in your way. </p><p><br></p><p>Once you got outside you saw that Rhodes, Sam, and Steve were all keeping the fight outside, you quickly glance the battlefield for the love of your life. It didn\u2019t take long for you to locate her behind a tank, you quickly raced to her dripping down to your knees next to her. </p><p><br></p><p><b><i>(Y/N) POV </i></b></p><p><br></p><p>You opened your eyes when you felt a body drop next to you, and for a moment you thought that maybe you had died and gone to heaven, and this was an angel, but it proved to be wrong when you noticed the fighting still going on around you. Even if the bullets had come to an almost cease fire. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201c W-Wanda? What are you doing? You should be getting the prints. \u201c you biased out, more in pain than actual judgement towards the woman.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201c Clint and Natasha are getting them. The best in the business they can handle it. \u201c Wanda\u2019s attention was on the blood soaked shirt, her own hands turning the same crimson color as your blood. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201c This doesn\u2019t look so good. It\u2019s lodged in my lower lumbar, probably my descending colon. I don\u2019t know how much more blood I can lose before passing out. \u201c your eyes began to feel heavy and you suddenly began to feel very tired.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201c No, no. You have to keep your eyes open my love. Please, just a little bit longer. \u201c The frantic tone of Wanda\u2019s voice was enough for you to open your eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201c Nat and Clint have the prints, everyone back to the quinjet now! Try and round up survivors if you can! \u201c </p><p><br></p><p>Despite your hearing faltering as well you heard Steve\u2019s orders through the comm, you quickly grabbed Wanda\u2019s hand before speaking. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201c Go Wanda, please. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m going anywhere, I can\u2019t stand and I really don\u2019t think I can stay awake any longer. \u201c </p><p><br></p><p>\u201c No, that\u2019s not an option. \u201c She was practically chocking on tears now. With a flip of her wrist you were soon telekinetically being lifted onto the quinjet. </p><p>Moments later the remaining Avengers boarded the the jet, Natasha and Tony quickly began administering first responder care, and Clint navigated the jet away from the base. Your eyelids became heavier by the second, you would hold on for as long as you needed to though, because you had the type of love you lived for.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"250\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"obsessive-fangirl-disorder:uS1vjaTQCEF4nZRq5xwksQ:ZdWjKi2YAiNqC\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/6e2c0fc19571a714e5a7baf7636afa48/tumblr_p93m0n8poy1v4zcyuo1_500.gif\" data-orig-height=\"250\" data-orig-width=\"500\"></figure></p>",

For being shot it really felt like having all the wind knocked out of you, except it hurt a hell of a lot more. </p><p><br /></p><p>Steve quickly disarmed the assailant before knocking him unconscious, his attention turning towards you. Pulling you behind a tank for cover he turned his attention to your wound.</p><p>&ldquo; (y/l/n ) oh my god. &ldquo; Steve thought quickly before approaching a corpse and quickly ripping the shirt from the body so he could us it to press against the wound to keep blood loss to a minimum. Out of the corner of my eye I could see Rhodes land in front of us to protect us from any oncoming threat.</p><p><br /></p><p><b><i>Wanda&rsquo;s POV</i></b></p><p><br /></p><p>You had been on the inside fighting with Clint by your side, he&rsquo;d fire an arrow and you&rsquo;d force enemies back with an assortment of your telekinesis and psionic abilities. It almost seemed as if the Hydra operatives were afraid to approach the pair, even though she knew that wasn&rsquo;t true. </p><p><br /></p><p>However the feeling of smug-ness would soon wear off, something changed within herself, she felt her connection to (y/n) sever slightly, but she knew what this was, it was the same thing she felt when Pietro died. It was like she could feel the bullet in her own body. Her temper quickly began to rise as she expelled psionic energy from her body causing the remaining Hydra agents to fall. </p><p><br /></p><p>Clint continued advancing until the building with Natasha looking for the prints but you knew you needed to get to (y/n). You broke out into a sprint out of the base, crippling anyone that got in your way. </p><p><br /></p><p>Once you got outside you saw that Rhodes, Sam, and Steve were all keeping the fight outside, you quickly glance the battlefield for the love of your life. It didn&rsquo;t take long for you to locate her behind a tank, you quickly raced to her dripping down to your knees next to her. </p><p><br /></p><p><b><i>(Y/N) POV </i></b></p><p><br /></p><p>You opened your eyes when you felt a body drop next to you, and for a moment you thought that maybe you had died and gone to heaven, and this was an angel, but it proved to be wrong when you noticed the fighting still going on around you. Even if the bullets had come to an almost cease fire. </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo; W-Wanda? What are you doing? You should be getting the prints. &ldquo; you biased out, more in pain than actual judgement towards the woman.</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo; Clint and Natasha are getting them. The best in the business they can handle it. &ldquo; Wanda&rsquo;s attention was on the blood soaked shirt, her own hands turning the same crimson color as your blood. </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo; This doesn&rsquo;t look so good. It&rsquo;s lodged in my lower lumbar, probably my descending colon. I don&rsquo;t know how much more blood I can lose before passing out. &ldquo; your eyes began to feel heavy and you suddenly began to feel very tired.</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo; No, no. You have to keep your eyes open my love. Please, just a little bit longer. &ldquo; The frantic tone of Wanda&rsquo;s voice was enough for you to open your eyes.</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo; Nat and Clint have the prints, everyone back to the quinjet now! Try and round up survivors if you can! &ldquo; </p><p><br /></p><p>Despite your hearing faltering as well you heard Steve&rsquo;s orders through the comm, you quickly grabbed Wanda&rsquo;s hand before speaking. </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo; Go Wanda, please. I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m going anywhere, I can&rsquo;t stand and I really don&rsquo;t think I can stay awake any longer. &ldquo; </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo; No, that&rsquo;s not an option. &ldquo; She was practically chocking on tears now. With a flip of her wrist you were soon telekinetically being lifted onto the quinjet. </p><p>Moments later the remaining Avengers boarded the the jet, Natasha and Tony quickly began administering first responder care, and Clint navigated the jet away from the base. Your eyelids became heavier by the second, you would hold on for as long as you needed to though, because you had the type of love you lived for.</p><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"1\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure></p>",
