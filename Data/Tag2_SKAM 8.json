Also, Part 5 seems to be mysteriously gone from my blog, which completely sucks, so I had to repost it <a href=\"https://it-even-makes-me-rhyme.tumblr.com/post/185746472508/id-be-lost-and-lonely-if-not-for-you-part-5\">here</a>.\u00a0</p><p>Note: I know nothing about the medical field or surgery, so that part might be a little inaccurate. Lol sorry.<br/></p><p>Again, thank you all for being incredible, and enjoy\u2764\ufe0f</p><!-- more --><p>The outdoor dining area on campus was packed as lunchtime rolled around. Lucas was making his way through the crowd to where Yann had grabbed them a table when a girl ran by him, knocking her backpack directly into his shoulder. </p><p>Lucas grumbled but didn\u2019t have the energy to yell after her. Plus, he knew she was probably in a hurry and couldn\u2019t really fault her for that. He was always rushing through campus to get from class to class. Once he spotted Yann and Basile sitting at a table in the shade, he forgot about the girl and sat down with his friends. </p><p>\u201cI think we should start a band,\u201d Basile remarked as Lucas unwrapped his sandwich. Neither he nor Yann responded to Basile\u2019s outburst, both boys staring at their lunches to avoid their friend\u2019s gaze. That was usually how these things went, partially because no wanted to encourage Basile\u2019s dumb ideas and partially because it was funny. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be a great way to meet girls and we\u2019ll get a ton of free alc-,\u201d</p><p>\u201cDude, something happened with Eliott,\u201d Lucas heard a voice he knew belonged to Arthur remark as footsteps approached their table.  </p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Lucas inquired as he lifted his eyes to meet Arthur\u2019s. The look that they shared at that moment made the blue-eyed boy\u2019s heart drop to his stomach. </p><p>\u201cI was on my way here and I saw an ambulance leaving the art building. I stopped to find out what was going on and heard some guy saying \u2018the Demaury kid\u2019 was in it,\u201d Arthur replied. </p><p>Lucas\u2019 ears started ringing after \u2018ambulance,\u2019 but he caught everything the other boy said. He quickly stood up and started backing away from his friends, but he paused when he realized he had no idea what his plan was. Lucas faintly registered Yann coming towards him and then felt a hand on his shoulder. </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t touch me!\u201d Lucas sucked in a shaky breath and squeezed his eyes shut as Yann retreated. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I just&hellip; they\u2019re taking him to General, right? That\u2019s the closest hospital. I need to get there. What\u2019s the fastest way to get there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call a taxi,\u201d Basile quickly offered as he jogged away. \u201cMeet me in front of the sports complex,\u201d he yelled. </p><p>Arthur started gathering all of their backpacks as Yann cleared the food of the table. Lucas didn\u2019t move from where he had paused earlier. He\u2019d always been a worst case scenario type of thinker, and that wasn\u2019t helping him as his mind searched for a reason why Eliott would be in an ambulance. </p><p>Did someone hurt Eliott? What if Eliott hurt himself? Maybe it was a medical thing. Did he have an episode? </p><p>He didn\u2019t remember being guided to the taxi, or most of the short ride to the hospital. It was only when the vehicle stopped in front of the hospital that came back to reality. The gang, clearly trying not to overwhelm Lucas, tried to wait for the boy to make a move before they exited the taxi. After a minute or so, the taxi driver cleared his throat, signaling that he needed to pick up other passengers. That prompted Yann to open his door and let himself out, then jog over to the other side of the vehicle and open Lucas\u2019 door. The shorted boy finally budged at that point and made his way towards the building. </p><p>The hospital was not as busy as Lucas expected it to be. Nurses, doctors, and orderlies were rushing around, trying to do their jobs, but there was no screaming, no blood smeared across the floor. He had guessed that TV dramas exaggerated that stuff, but at that moment he knew for sure.</p><p>Lucas realized then that Eliott could be anywhere in the hospital, depending on the condition he was in. The blue-eyed boy quickly looked towards Yann, silently begging him to figure out what they should do. </p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s head to the desk over there and see if they can give us any information,\u201d Yann suggested, pointing to a round counter  with doctors and nurses surrounding it. Lucas let the other boy lead the way as he slowly followed behind with Basile and Arthur. </p><p>\u201cHi, we\u2019re hoping to find out where our friend, Eliott Demaury, is,\u201d Yann sweetly offered to one of the men sitting behind the counter. </p><p>The gentleman, clearly unimpressed by Yann\u2019s sunny demeanor, looked down at his tablet and started swiping slowly. Lucas wanted to grab him by the front of his scrubs and will him to move quicker, but he couldn\u2019t bring himself to move. </p><p>It all made his feel so useless. Ever since Arthur ran up to the table and told him what had happened, he\u2019d been unable to exert any energy beyond what was required to keep him alive. Eliott was his best friend, and yet Yann, Basile, and Arthur were the ones taking action to get them to him. </p><p>As he looked at the other three boys\u2019 faces, he saw anxiousness, but he also saw determination. If they looked back at his, he was sure all they would see was terror. He was paralyzed by his own panic. The best person in his life could be gravely injured, and he wasn\u2019t doing anything to get to him. Eliott deserved better than what Lucas was giving him, but apprehension made it impossible for Lucas to offer that up. </p><p>The fact that the gang was there with him was probably the only reason he wasn\u2019t still sitting at that outdoor table on campus or in the backseat of the taxi. He bet he\u2019d feel incredibly lucky to have them at that moment if he wasn\u2019t incapable of any human emotion beyond fear. </p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s in surgery right now, guys, but that\u2019s all I can tell you,\u201d the man stated, bringing Lucas back to reality. \u201cI can only release information to family members.\u201d </p><p>\u201cLucas is family!\u201d Basile shouted, looking to Lucas expectantly. </p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your relation to Mr. Demaury?\u201d The man, who Lucas now presumed was a nurse, questioned as he pursed his lips and raised his eyebrows. </p><p>\u201cI&hellip;ah&hellip;we\u2019re,\u201d but Lucas had no idea what to say. He stood there, stuttering and panicking as four sets of eyes focused on him.  </p><p>Eliott was his family; he\u2019d been sure of that for most of his life. But there was no word for what they were to each other. It never bothered Lucas before, but at that moment, it was the most frustrating truth in the world. He wanted to force himself to say \u2018cousin\u2019 or \u2018stepbrother\u2019 or anything that would get him more information, but he couldn\u2019t bring himself to do it. </p><p>Truthfully, he was scared to know more. If he lied his way into the family category, then he would have to find out Eliott\u2019s condition. He couldn\u2019t handle the possible implications of that decision. At that moment, he was in the state of ignorance, and it was slowly killing him, but he was still breathing, still functioning. Once he found out more, though, he might actually break down. If the news was bad, which was a real possibility, Lucas wouldn\u2019t be able to cope with that. He couldn\u2019t live his life without Eliott, that much he knew.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>Looking back, he first had that realization when he was a teenager; right after Eliott started university, and he left Lucas alone at school to fend for himself.</p><p>(At least, that was how Lucas saw it at the time. Truthfully, he still had Imane and Yann to keep him company.) </p><p>Not having Eliott around was borderline unbearable. But he was incredibly happy for his best friend. No one deserved to finally head to university more than Eliott. </p><p>After failing to complete his bac the first time around, Eliott had to redo Terminale. When he broke the news to Lucas, (who already knew but wanted Eliott to be able to tell him for himself), he did it with a weak chuckle and a \u201cat least we\u2019ll be in school together for one more year.\u201d Lucas couldn\u2019t stop the tears from falling on his cheeks, though, because he knew. He knew how hard Eliott had worked throughout school and how passionate he was about studying art at university. And, because of his bipolar disorder, he wasn\u2019t going to be able to do that for another year. </p><p>Lucas felt like he should have done something. He should\u2019ve known that Eliott had stopped taking his meds and that he was entering a manic state. But he missed the signs. </p><p>Most of his time had been spent studying for his end-of-year tests and writing papers. He tried not to annoy Eliott, because he knew the boy was under a lot of pressure with his exams. Whenever he would check in with him through text, Eliott always told Lucas he was doing great and studying hard.</p><p>But what he was really doing was drawing. He had filled multiple notebooks with drawings of everything and everyone in his life. Some were colorful, others were black-and-white, and others were only half finished. The boy stayed up for days completing his project while he was meant to be preparing for his bac. Two days before exams began, Eliott went to one of the train stations by school and tried to paint a mural on the wall. He was picked up by the police and brought to the hospital, where he eventually entered a depressive state. </p><p>A few weeks later, when the dust settled and Eliott knew he was going to have to repeat the year, he and Lucas were sitting at the park, enjoying the cool weather when the younger boy asked the ever-present question. \u201cWhy did you stop taking your meds?\u201d</p><p>Eliott sighed and started his response without looking at Lucas. \u201dI just wanted to be able to go to university like a regular student. And before you tell me I am a regular student, you know that I\u2019m not. But I felt like I could be. I started reading up on the different classes I\u2019d be able to take and looking into the on-campus apartments, and it all sounded so amazing. I\u2019d have to leave you, which sucked, but the university is only 20 minutes away from our neighborhood by bus, so I knew we\u2019d see each other all the time, and you would visit. Everything just felt like it was going great, so I stopped taking my meds because I didn\u2019t think I needed them.\u201d</p><p>Once Eliott finally looked at him, Lucas didn\u2019t know what to say. After a minute, something did come to mind, and he knew it had to be said. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to come back to school because of me. If you want to go somewhere else, be at a different school for your retake, I get that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLu, the fact that I have to do this, it\u2019s awful. But I know it\u2019d be ten times worse if I didn\u2019t have you there to eat lunch with, to sit with before school, and to take the bus with. That is what\u2019s making this whole ordeal so much more bearable.\u201d Lucas smiled at that because even thought he couldn\u2019t do anything for Eliott during his episode, he could do something now. He could be there for him that school year. </p><p>Eliott did pass his bac that year (with flying colors) and headed off to university. The day he moved out, he handed Lucas a very antiquated printout of directions from his house to Eliott\u2019s dorm building. The trip was 22 minutes total, which was a lot longer than the 6-minute walk between their two houses. And Lucas knew that there were a bunch of apps that could tell him the same information a lot quicker. But he loved that Eliott took the time to print the directions out, so he smiled brightly and hugged his best friend. </p><p>Lucas felt spoiled by the fact that he and Eliott had spent two years of lyc\u00e9e together instead of just one. Although the circumstances were terrible, he still had his best friend with him for an extra year. He\u2019d never been at that school sans Eliott, and on his first day without him, he felt completely lost. He rode the bus to school alone, sat at lunch with Yann picking at his food and not eating, and stood outside in the schoolyard at the end of the day, not wanting to make the trip home by himself. </p><p>Eliott called him that night, to ask how his first day of Terminale went, and Lucas held back his tears as he blatantly lied to Eliott about all the great things that he did to kick off his last year of lyc\u00e9e. Eliott could tell something was wrong, and asked Lucas multiple times to tell him what it was, but the shorted boy kept his mouth shut. There was no way he was going to drag Eliott down into his cave of self-pity. Once he hung up the phone, the tears freely flowed as he laid back and stared at his bedroom ceiling. </p><p>The realization that hit Lucas at that moment was jarring. Over the past two years, he and Eliott, who were already extremely close, had grown even closer. So close, in fact, that Lucas felt like part of him was missing the entire day he spent at school without his best friend. It was hard for Lucas to acknowledge how empty he felt without Eliott, because he knew he was only setting himself up for disappointment. </p><p>Lucas admittedly started spiraling from there. He concluded that one day, Eliott was going to find a serious girlfriend, get married, have kids, get a full-time job. Then, Lucas would probably never see him again. So really, this year was going to be good practice for his future without Eliott. </p><p>Future without Eliott? It wasn\u2019t like he was dying. Shit, Lucas didn\u2019t even want to think about Eliott dying, ever. He quickly pushed that thought aside. </p><p>It was pathetic, really, because Eliott was totally fine going off to university without Lucas. Sure, he said he missed him, but he called Lucas after his first day of classes and told him all about how awesome they were. And he called him the next day and told him how awesome those classes were as well. Then, he told Lucas during their Wednesday phone call that he wanted him to visit soon so he could show him all the cool coffee shops and bars he already found around campus.</p><p>Although Lucas was happy for his best friend, he was also kind of hurt that it seemed like Eliott was having such a great time without him. Wow, how fucked up is he? He\u2019s so fucking selfish. Lucas decided at that point that he wouldn\u2019t bother Eliott anymore. He didn\u2019t want to burden the other boy with his overdramatic teenage angst. </p><p>Right after he finished that thought, his phone started ringing. When he checked the screen, he saw that it was Eliott again. He contemplated not answering, because he knew he was still sniffling and hoarse, but Eliott would probably just call again. \u201cHey, Eli! Calling again so soon?\u201d He tried to sound as cheery as possible. </p><p>\u201cI miss you, Lu. Like, really miss you. And I know I\u2019ve only been gone like a week and I know I\u2019m only 20 minutes away, but I miss you,\u201d Eliott blurted out. </p><p>All of the breath was knocked out of Lucas\u2019 body as he listened to Eliott\u2019s words, so it took him a few seconds to whisper back, \u201cI miss you too, you nerd.\u201d</p><p>Eliott loudly chuckled at that. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me sooner? I\u2019ve been missing you since I left, but I didn\u2019t want to say anything because I\u2019m supposed to be the cool university student.\u201d </p><p>\u201cEvery time we talk, you tell me about how much you love school and how much fun you\u2019re having. I didn\u2019t want to bring you down with my sadness, but school really sucks without you,\u201d Lucas admitted. </p><p>\u201cI am enjoying school, and I\u2019ve met some cool people, but I really wish you were here. I mean, you had to know. I\u2019ve called you every single day since I left, and I practically begged you to visit me this weekend,\u201d Eliott huffed out. Oh, so that\u2019s why he kept mentioning the bars and coffee shops. </p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ll be there. Because I really miss you, too, in case I haven\u2019t said that enough yet,\u201d Lucas smiled for the first time in days. </p><p>Yeah, he knew it was cliche, but he needed Eliott around almost as much as he needed air. Or water. Or anything else that makes it possible for a human being to live.   </p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>\u201cLucas! Sweetie, you\u2019re here,\u201d he was snapped back to reality by small hands wrapped around his upper back and the light press of lips on his cheek. He realized that while he was deep in thought, someone has steered him away from the desk and brought him to the waiting room. Yann, Basile, and Arthur were sitting in the uncomfortable plastic chairs, but he was still standing. </p><p>He also realized that Eloise was the one who greeted him a few seconds ago. She was standing in front of him with tear-stained cheeks and watery eyes. Lucas could tell she left work in a hurry because all she had in her hands were her car keys. \u201cI tried to call you. So did your mom,\u201d Eloise explained. Lucas realized he hadn\u2019t even thought about his phone since they left campus. He hoped it was someone, probably in his backpack. He wanted to ask Yann about it, just so Eloise would stop looking at him with those worried eyes that made him want to sink into the ground, but he thought that\u2019d be inappropriate, so he stopped himself before the words left his mouth. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Lucas forced himself to say.</p><p>\u201cSorry for what, Lucas?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not really sure,\u201d he confessed. \u201cThey wouldn\u2019t tell me anything when I arrived. I\u2019m not family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re my family, honey. And Eliott\u2019s. These people may not know that, but I do,\u201d she rubbed her thumb over his cheekbone. </p><p>It was sick, really, Lucas thought as he looked at the woman who was like a second mother to him. Her son was in the hospital and yet she was comforting Lucas. </p><p>He looked to his left when he heard the waiting room doors sliding open and saw Lucille entering with one of her friends. She was also tearing up as she took in her surroundings, clearly flustered. Could everyone feel emotion but him? </p><p>He pushed aside that thought as Lucille met his gaze. They stared at each other for a second, blank expressions on both their faces, before she looked away, turning to the girl with her. </p><p>Lucas turned back to face Eloise. As much as he didn\u2019t want to ask, he knew that he had to. That\u2019s what you did in those situations. You found out whether or not the person you loved was gravely injured. </p><p>However, before he could speak, Lucille approached them with an anxious expression on her face. \u201cMrs. Demaury, how is he? What happened to him?\u201d</p><p>At that, the three guys stood up and crowded around Lucas. The action, although it came from a place of love, made him feel like he was suffocating. </p><p>Eloise took a long breath before she directed her words at Lucas, much to Lucille\u2019s annoyance. \u201cHe\u2019s in surgery right now. One of the bookshelves in the art studio gave out while he was working and it fell on his leg. It crushed some of his bones and ligaments. It\u2019s a severe fracture, but they don\u2019t know the full extent of the damage yet.\u201d </p><p>A feeling of relief washed over Lucas\u2019 body. \u201cThat\u2019s good,\u201d he declared before he had the chance to think about it. \u201cI mean, not good but&hellip;better than&hellip;other&hellip;things.\u201d He heard Lucille scoff at his stuttering, so he shut his mouth before he had the chance to make any more idiotic statements. </p><p>Eloise offered him a small smile. \u201cYes Lucas, you\u2019re right. It definitely is.\u201d </p><p>After that, it was a waiting game. Lucas\u2019 mom and Nana Mary arrived a half-hour after Eloise, and Andrew appeared an hour after that. When his mom sat down next to him, Lucas burrowed himself into her side, looking for the feeling of security the action provided him with when he was a child. </p><p>A doctor came out to give them an update at some point. She explained that there was a lot of damage to Eliott\u2019s left tibia, but thankfully they hadn\u2019t run into any complications with the initial repair. When Lucas heard that the surgery would take at least another hour, he almost groaned. He couldn\u2019t keep waiting around like that. It made him feel small and helpless. </p><p>The gang was still there, so Lucas told them to head home. They protested adamantly, but begrudgingly left when he promised to send them constant updates. </p><p>The next two hours passed slowly, excruciatingly so, but the same doctor as before came out and told them that Eliott had been moved to recovery. He was slightly groggy, but he was allowed to have two visitors at a time. Eloise and Andrew quickly followed the doctor toward another wing of the hospital. Lucas wanted to go as well, but he knew Eliott\u2019s parents deserved to see their son first, so he kept quiet. After all, he\u2019d been waiting for hours. He could handle 20 more minutes. </p><p>After a little while, Eloise came back to the waiting room and walked up to where Lucas and his mom were sitting. \u201cLucas, he\u2019s still a little dazed, but he\u2019d like to see you if you\u2019re up for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Lucas shot out of his chair and started moving towards the direction he watched Eloise come from only seconds earlier.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to see him,\u201d he heard from behind him. He stopped and turned to see Lucille scurrying after them. In all his worry, he\u2019d forgotten she was even there. Honestly, he wished he could again. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Lucille, but we don\u2019t want to overwhelm him right after surgery. Maybe you should head home. They\u2019re keeping him here overnight so you can come back tomorrow and see him,\u201d Eloise offered politely. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m his girlfriend. There\u2019s no way I\u2019m leaving. I know he wants to see me,\u201d Lucille shot back, ignoring the older woman\u2019s suggestion.</p><p>\u201cWell, he specifically asked to see Lucas, so that\u2019s who I\u2019m taking to see him. After that, I don\u2019t know if he\u2019ll be up for any more visitors, but you\u2019re welcome to sit in the waiting room.\u201d At that, Eloise put her arm around Lucas\u2019 shoulder and guided him away. She stopped them in front of an elevator and pressed the \u201cUp\u201d button. They waited in silence until the elevator arrived. After everyone cleared out of it, they stepped in and Eloise press the button marked \u201cfour.\u201d</p><p>She was the one who broke the silence. \u201cI\u2019m sorry but that girl is too much. And I know she and my son broke up, so she should probably stop calling herself \u2018his girlfriend\u2019 now.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah, she\u2019s doesn\u2019t like me,\u201d Lucas admitted as they exited the elevator and quickly turned a corner, coming upon a hallway marked \u201cRecovery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t imagine why,\u201d Eloise smirked. Before Lucas could question her, she remarked \u201c421, here we are\u201d and pushed a slightly ajar wooden door further open. Lucas slowly followed her in until he was staring at his best friend, who was sitting in a hospital bed with his eyes half-open. His face was turned away from Lucas as he stared out the window, so he didn\u2019t notice the younger boy\u2019s entrance. </p><p>Eloise quickly remedied that. \u201cEli, look who\u2019s here to see you.\u201d</p><p>Eliott rotated his who body to look towards where his mother\u2019s voice came from. He and Lucas quickly locked eyes, and a closed lip smile appeared on both their faces. \u201cHi, Lu,\u201d Eliott whispered. </p><p>\u201cHi, Eli,\u201d Lucas whispered back. </p><p>Andrew chose that moment to clear his throat, and Lucas was thankful because he\u2019d forgotten the older man was even there. He was sitting in a large recliner in the corner of the room, staring out the window as Eliott had been doing earlier. \u201cI\u2019m going to check in with the doctors and ask them about the next steps of your recovery, Eliott.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll walk out with you. I want to go back down to the waiting room and tell Mary and Isabelle to head home. They\u2019re probably exhausted and I\u2019m sure Lucas will be here for a little while. One of us can bring Lucas home later,\u201d Eloise proclaimed. </p><p>Lucas wasn\u2019t sure if they knew he wasn\u2019t staying at the apartment. If not, that\u2019d probably be an awkward conversation later. </p><p>Both parents left, and all that remained was Eliott and Lucas, staring at each other across a hospital room. Lucas realized at that moment that he was standing as far away from Eliott as the room allowed, so he took a few steps towards his bed. He stopped himself at what he felt was a respectable distance, afraid to overwhelm the other boy. </p><p>Truthfully, he had no idea what he could say to Eliott that wouldn\u2019t reveal the fact that he hadn\u2019t been able to form a coherent sentence in the past few hours. There was no reason for Eliott to know how scared Lucas was; it wouldn\u2019t help his recovery. </p><p>The boy in the hospital bed winced as he shifted to sit up higher. \u201cGood thing I\u2019m an artist and not an up-and-coming football star because this would definitely be career-ending,\u201d he laughed weakly. </p><p>Lucas wanted to laugh with him, really, he did. But he couldn\u2019t. His body wouldn\u2019t allow him to feel any joy. It wouldn\u2019t let him feel much of anything but worry and panic. So he just stood there, nodding at Eliott with a blank expression on his face. </p><p>\u201cLucas, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d Eliott said seriously. And Lucas scoffed at that because seriously? </p><p>\u201cAre you really asking me that right now? As you sit in a hospital bed with those&hellip;things sticking out of your leg?\u201d</p><p>Eliott frowned at that. \u201cI\u2019m fine. It doesn\u2019t even hurt that much, rea-\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not fine!\u201d Lucas cut him off. Every emotion he\u2019d been unable to feel earlier was now fighting to be released from the pent-up confines of his mind and body. \u201cYou\u2019re hurting. They had to preform major surgery on your leg. You\u2019ll need months of physical therapy!\u201d Lucas felt his chest constrict as a sob escaped his mouth. Of course now is the time I finally cry. He looked down at the scuffed tiles of the room and thought about how much he both never wanted to leave and didn\u2019t want to be there anymore. </p><p>The younger boy looked back up at his best friend and saw that he was also tearing up. It made him feel like an asshole. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean to upset you with my yelling. I\u2019m just scared.\u201d </p><p>\u201cCome here,\u201d Eliott beckoned Lucas closer to the bed and the younger boy sheepishly complied. Once he was within reach, Eliott took him by the wrist and guided his hand towards the older boy\u2019s cheek. \u201cI\u2019m here. I\u2019m alright.\u201d </p><p>Lucas instantly relaxed. It was magical, the way Eliott could do that. </p><p>\u201cI know that now. But the past few hours have been the worst of my life. You\u2019re my best friend, and we\u2019ve barely talked in the last week and a half. What if something had happened to you? I wouldn\u2019t have been able to live with myself.\u201d </p><p>Eliott didn\u2019t respond to Lucas\u2019 question, but he kept his hand lightly gripped around Lucas\u2019 wrist as a sign that the younger boy shouldn\u2019t remove his hand from its position on Eliott\u2019s cheek. He was so breathtaking, even sitting in a hospital bed in an unflattering patient gown with tears running down his face. </p><p>Lucas realized that there was no chance he was going to be able to stay away from Eliott any longer. After the events of the day, he wanted to be around him as much as possible; his stubbornness and pining needed to be put aside. </p><p>His feelings for the other boy hadn\u2019t subsided, and they clearly weren\u2019t going to any time soon. Now, more than ever, he knew that he loved Eliott in a hundred different ways. That probably should have frightened him, but it didn\u2019t. If anything, it actually excited him to feel something that strongly, especially for his Eliott. </p><p>The way that Eliott loved him back, platonically, had to be enough for him. Eliott needed him to be strong while he healed. If he truly loved the older boy as much as he told himself he did, he\u2019d put Eliott\u2019s recovery before his own feelings.  </p><p>Lucas gently removed his hand from Eliott\u2019s face. The older boy went to protest, but stopped when he saw Lucas moving to lean on the side of his hospital bed. He shifted his good leg so Lucas could sit, and the shorter boy rested with one food tucked under him and the other planted on the ground. \u201cI know you\u2019ll be staying with your parents for a little while, but I\u2019m coming home. I\u2019ll stay at Yann\u2019s tonight, because some of my stuff is there, but I\u2019ll be back at our apartment tomorrow.\u201d </p><p>Again, the older boy was silent for a couple of seconds, but Lucas knew what he was going to say. \u201cThat makes me really happy, but I don\u2019t want this whole thing to make you feel like you have to come home,\u201d Eliott stated seriously. \u201cIf you\u2019re still not ready, I\u2019d rather you just stay with Yann until you know you\u2019ll come back for good.\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m ready,\u201d Lucas reassured him.  \u201cBeing away from you didn\u2019t suddenly make me feel like we weren\u2019t close anymore. And I like how close we are anyway. Screw anyone who thinks differently. This whole thing was a stupid idea brought on by my reaction to&hellip;.,\u201d Lucas trailed off. He remembered then that Lucille was still there. </p><p>Just because he was trying to be adult about the situation didn\u2019t make that reminder hurt any less. The boy began to stand up and back away from the hospital bed. </p><p>\u201cThe point is, I\u2019m moving back home. Anyway, your girlfriend is downstairs in the waiting room. I can send her in on my way out. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re tired, but&hellip;\u201d </p><p>\u201cLucille\u2019s here? Why? And don\u2019t call her my girlfriend. You know we broke up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could\u2019ve gotten back together. I don\u2019t know.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI talked to her once after that party to tell her not to bother crawling back because we were done for good,\u201d Eliott declared with an insistent look in his eyes. Lucas had to admit that made him feel good. </p><p>\u201cSo, you don\u2019t want to see her?\u201d Lucas inquired, slightly hopeful. </p><p>\u201cFuck, no. She made both of us feel like shit. I\u2019m done with her. And I told you your moving out was a moronic idea. Glad we\u2019re finally on the same page. Also, don\u2019t leave,\u201d Eliott laughed. </p><p>Lucas couldn\u2019t stop his own grin from forming. He moved back towards the bed, but before he could return to his former spot, Eliott tugged on his sleeve to bring him closer to the top half of his reclined body. \u201cLay with me, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Eli. I\u2019ll hurt you! Your leg is all fractured and stuff,\u201d Lucas screeched as he playfully resisted Eliott\u2019s weak grip. </p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019ll lay on my right side. Trust me, there\u2019s enough room in this bed for both of us, tiny boy.\u201d</p><p>Lucas gave in pretty quickly after that. He made sure to be extremely careful as he got onto the bed, and he kept his right leg dangling off the side as his left side pressed against Eliott. It wasn\u2019t the most comfortable position, but it was exactly where Lucas wanted to be. </p><p>\u201cLu, I\u2019m not going to lie to you, I\u2019ll probably be asleep in the next 30 seconds,\u201d Eliott stated as he yawned and nuzzled into Lucas. </p><p>\u201cMe too, Eli. Worrying about you all day was tiring,\u201d Lucas responded. He knew it was probably a bad idea to fall asleep in Eliott\u2019s hospital bed, but he couldn\u2019t bring himself to care. </p>",

Lucas was making his way through the crowd to where Yann had grabbed them a table when a girl ran by him, knocking her backpack directly into his shoulder. </p><p>Lucas grumbled but didn\u2019t have the energy to yell after her. Plus, he knew she was probably in a hurry and couldn\u2019t really fault her for that. He was always rushing through campus to get from class to class. Once he spotted Yann and Basile sitting at a table in the shade, he forgot about the girl and sat down with his friends. </p><p>\u201cI think we should start a band,\u201d Basile remarked as Lucas unwrapped his sandwich. Neither he nor Yann responded to Basile\u2019s outburst, both boys staring at their lunches to avoid their friend\u2019s gaze. That was usually how these things went, partially because no wanted to encourage Basile\u2019s dumb ideas and partially because it was funny. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be a great way to meet girls and we\u2019ll get a ton of free alc-,\u201d</p><p>\u201cDude, something happened with Eliott,\u201d Lucas heard a voice he knew belonged to Arthur remark as footsteps approached their table.  </p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Lucas inquired as he lifted his eyes to meet Arthur\u2019s. The look that they shared at that moment made the blue-eyed boy\u2019s heart drop to his stomach. </p><p>\u201cI was on my way here and I saw an ambulance leaving the art building. I stopped to find out what was going on and heard some guy saying \u2018the Demaury kid\u2019 was in it,\u201d Arthur replied. </p><p>Lucas\u2019 ears started ringing after \u2018ambulance,\u2019 but he caught everything the other boy said. He quickly stood up and started backing away from his friends, but he paused when he realized he had no idea what his plan was. Lucas faintly registered Yann coming towards him and then felt a hand on his shoulder. </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t touch me!\u201d Lucas sucked in a shaky breath and squeezed his eyes shut as Yann retreated. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I just\u2026 they\u2019re taking him to General, right? That\u2019s the closest hospital. I need to get there. What\u2019s the fastest way to get there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call a taxi,\u201d Basile quickly offered as he jogged away. \u201cMeet me in front of the sports complex,\u201d he yelled. </p><p>Arthur started gathering all of their backpacks as Yann cleared the food of the table. Lucas didn\u2019t move from where he had paused earlier. He\u2019d always been a worst case scenario type of thinker, and that wasn\u2019t helping him as his mind searched for a reason why Eliott would be in an ambulance. </p><p>Did someone hurt Eliott? What if Eliott hurt himself? Maybe it was a medical thing. Did he have an episode? </p><p>He didn\u2019t remember being guided to the taxi, or most of the short ride to the hospital. It was only when the vehicle stopped in front of the hospital that came back to reality. The gang, clearly trying not to overwhelm Lucas, tried to wait for the boy to make a move before they exited the taxi. After a minute or so, the taxi driver cleared his throat, signaling that he needed to pick up other passengers. That prompted Yann to open his door and let himself out, then jog over to the other side of the vehicle and open Lucas\u2019 door. The shorted boy finally budged at that point and made his way towards the building. </p><p>The hospital was not as busy as Lucas expected it to be. Nurses, doctors, and orderlies were rushing around, trying to do their jobs, but there was no screaming, no blood smeared across the floor. He had guessed that TV dramas exaggerated that stuff, but at that moment he knew for sure.</p><p>Lucas realized then that Eliott could be anywhere in the hospital, depending on the condition he was in. The blue-eyed boy quickly looked towards Yann, silently begging him to figure out what they should do. </p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s head to the desk over there and see if they can give us any information,\u201d Yann suggested, pointing to a round counter  with doctors and nurses surrounding it. Lucas let the other boy lead the way as he slowly followed behind with Basile and Arthur. </p><p>\u201cHi, we\u2019re hoping to find out where our friend, Eliott Demaury, is,\u201d Yann sweetly offered to one of the men sitting behind the counter. </p><p>The gentleman, clearly unimpressed by Yann\u2019s sunny demeanor, looked down at his tablet and started swiping slowly. Lucas wanted to grab him by the front of his scrubs and will him to move quicker, but he couldn\u2019t bring himself to move. </p><p>It all made his feel so useless. Ever since Arthur ran up to the table and told him what had happened, he\u2019d been unable to exert any energy beyond what was required to keep him alive. Eliott was his best friend, and yet Yann, Basile, and Arthur were the ones taking action to get them to him. </p><p>As he looked at the other three boys\u2019 faces, he saw anxiousness, but he also saw determination. If they looked back at his, he was sure all they would see was terror. He was paralyzed by his own panic. The best person in his life could be gravely injured, and he wasn\u2019t doing anything to get to him. Eliott deserved better than what Lucas was giving him, but apprehension made it impossible for Lucas to offer that up. </p><p>The fact that the gang was there with him was probably the only reason he wasn\u2019t still sitting at that outdoor table on campus or in the backseat of the taxi. He bet he\u2019d feel incredibly lucky to have them at that moment if he wasn\u2019t incapable of any human emotion beyond fear. </p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s in surgery right now, guys, but that\u2019s all I can tell you,\u201d the man stated, bringing Lucas back to reality. \u201cI can only release information to family members.\u201d </p><p>\u201cLucas is family!\u201d Basile shouted, looking to Lucas expectantly. </p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your relation to Mr. Demaury?\u201d The man, who Lucas now presumed was a nurse, questioned as he pursed his lips and raised his eyebrows. </p><p>\u201cI\u2026ah\u2026we\u2019re,\u201d but Lucas had no idea what to say. He stood there, stuttering and panicking as four sets of eyes focused on him.  </p><p>Eliott was his family; he\u2019d been sure of that for most of his life. But there was no word for what they were to each other. It never bothered Lucas before, but at that moment, it was the most frustrating truth in the world. He wanted to force himself to say \u2018cousin\u2019 or \u2018stepbrother\u2019 or anything that would get him more information, but he couldn\u2019t bring himself to do it. </p><p>Truthfully, he was scared to know more. If he lied his way into the family category, then he would have to find out Eliott\u2019s condition. He couldn\u2019t handle the possible implications of that decision. At that moment, he was in the state of ignorance, and it was slowly killing him, but he was still breathing, still functioning. Once he found out more, though, he might actually break down. If the news was bad, which was a real possibility, Lucas wouldn\u2019t be able to cope with that. He couldn\u2019t live his life without Eliott, that much he knew.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>Looking back, he first had that realization when he was a teenager; right after Eliott started university, and he left Lucas alone at school to fend for himself.</p><p>(At least, that was how Lucas saw it at the time. Truthfully, he still had Imane and Yann to keep him company.) </p><p>Not having Eliott around was borderline unbearable. But he was incredibly happy for his best friend. No one deserved to finally head to university more than Eliott. </p><p>After failing to complete his bac the first time around, Eliott had to redo Terminale. When he broke the news to Lucas, (who already knew but wanted Eliott to be able to tell him for himself), he did it with a weak chuckle and a \u201cat least we\u2019ll be in school together for one more year.\u201d Lucas couldn\u2019t stop the tears from falling on his cheeks, though, because he knew. He knew how hard Eliott had worked throughout school and how passionate he was about studying art at university. And, because of his bipolar disorder, he wasn\u2019t going to be able to do that for another year. </p><p>Lucas felt like he should have done something. He should\u2019ve known that Eliott had stopped taking his meds and that he was entering a manic state. But he missed the signs. </p><p>Most of his time had been spent studying for his end-of-year tests and writing papers. He tried not to annoy Eliott, because he knew the boy was under a lot of pressure with his exams. Whenever he would check in with him through text, Eliott always told Lucas he was doing great and studying hard.</p><p>But what he was really doing was drawing. He had filled multiple notebooks with drawings of everything and everyone in his life. Some were colorful, others were black-and-white, and others were only half finished. The boy stayed up for days completing his project while he was meant to be preparing for his bac. Two days before exams began, Eliott went to one of the train stations by school and tried to paint a mural on the wall. He was picked up by the police and brought to the hospital, where he eventually entered a depressive state. </p><p>A few weeks later, when the dust settled and Eliott knew he was going to have to repeat the year, he and Lucas were sitting at the park, enjoying the cool weather when the younger boy asked the ever-present question. \u201cWhy did you stop taking your meds?\u201d</p><p>Eliott sighed and started his response without looking at Lucas. \u201dI just wanted to be able to go to university like a regular student. And before you tell me I am a regular student, you know that I\u2019m not. But I felt like I could be. I started reading up on the different classes I\u2019d be able to take and looking into the on-campus apartments, and it all sounded so amazing. I\u2019d have to leave you, which sucked, but the university is only 20 minutes away from our neighborhood by bus, so I knew we\u2019d see each other all the time, and you would visit. Everything just felt like it was going great, so I stopped taking my meds because I didn\u2019t think I needed them.\u201d</p><p>Once Eliott finally looked at him, Lucas didn\u2019t know what to say. After a minute, something did come to mind, and he knew it had to be said. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to come back to school because of me. If you want to go somewhere else, be at a different school for your retake, I get that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLu, the fact that I have to do this, it\u2019s awful. But I know it\u2019d be ten times worse if I didn\u2019t have you there to eat lunch with, to sit with before school, and to take the bus with. That is what\u2019s making this whole ordeal so much more bearable.\u201d Lucas smiled at that because even thought he couldn\u2019t do anything for Eliott during his episode, he could do something now. He could be there for him that school year. </p><p>Eliott did pass his bac that year (with flying colors) and headed off to university. The day he moved out, he handed Lucas a very antiquated printout of directions from his house to Eliott\u2019s dorm building. The trip was 22 minutes total, which was a lot longer than the 6-minute walk between their two houses. And Lucas knew that there were a bunch of apps that could tell him the same information a lot quicker. But he loved that Eliott took the time to print the directions out, so he smiled brightly and hugged his best friend. </p><p>Lucas felt spoiled by the fact that he and Eliott had spent two years of lyc\u00e9e together instead of just one. Although the circumstances were terrible, he still had his best friend with him for an extra year. He\u2019d never been at that school sans Eliott, and on his first day without him, he felt completely lost. He rode the bus to school alone, sat at lunch with Yann picking at his food and not eating, and stood outside in the schoolyard at the end of the day, not wanting to make the trip home by himself. </p><p>Eliott called him that night, to ask how his first day of Terminale went, and Lucas held back his tears as he blatantly lied to Eliott about all the great things that he did to kick off his last year of lyc\u00e9e. Eliott could tell something was wrong, and asked Lucas multiple times to tell him what it was, but the shorted boy kept his mouth shut. There was no way he was going to drag Eliott down into his cave of self-pity. Once he hung up the phone, the tears freely flowed as he laid back and stared at his bedroom ceiling. </p><p>The realization that hit Lucas at that moment was jarring. Over the past two years, he and Eliott, who were already extremely close, had grown even closer. So close, in fact, that Lucas felt like part of him was missing the entire day he spent at school without his best friend. It was hard for Lucas to acknowledge how empty he felt without Eliott, because he knew he was only setting himself up for disappointment. </p><p>Lucas admittedly started spiraling from there. He concluded that one day, Eliott was going to find a serious girlfriend, get married, have kids, get a full-time job. Then, Lucas would probably never see him again. So really, this year was going to be good practice for his future without Eliott. </p><p>Future without Eliott? It wasn\u2019t like he was dying. Shit, Lucas didn\u2019t even want to think about Eliott dying, ever. He quickly pushed that thought aside. </p><p>It was pathetic, really, because Eliott was totally fine going off to university without Lucas. Sure, he said he missed him, but he called Lucas after his first day of classes and told him all about how awesome they were. And he called him the next day and told him how awesome those classes were as well. Then, he told Lucas during their Wednesday phone call that he wanted him to visit soon so he could show him all the cool coffee shops and bars he already found around campus.</p><p>Although Lucas was happy for his best friend, he was also kind of hurt that it seemed like Eliott was having such a great time without him. Wow, how fucked up is he? He\u2019s so fucking selfish. Lucas decided at that point that he wouldn\u2019t bother Eliott anymore. He didn\u2019t want to burden the other boy with his overdramatic teenage angst. </p><p>Right after he finished that thought, his phone started ringing. When he checked the screen, he saw that it was Eliott again. He contemplated not answering, because he knew he was still sniffling and hoarse, but Eliott would probably just call again. \u201cHey, Eli! Calling again so soon?\u201d He tried to sound as cheery as possible. </p><p>\u201cI miss you, Lu. Like, really miss you. And I know I\u2019ve only been gone like a week and I know I\u2019m only 20 minutes away, but I miss you,\u201d Eliott blurted out. </p><p>All of the breath was knocked out of Lucas\u2019 body as he listened to Eliott\u2019s words, so it took him a few seconds to whisper back, \u201cI miss you too, you nerd.\u201d</p><p>Eliott loudly chuckled at that. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me sooner? I\u2019ve been missing you since I left, but I didn\u2019t want to say anything because I\u2019m supposed to be the cool university student.\u201d </p><p>\u201cEvery time we talk, you tell me about how much you love school and how much fun you\u2019re having. I didn\u2019t want to bring you down with my sadness, but school really sucks without you,\u201d Lucas admitted. </p><p>\u201cI am enjoying school, and I\u2019ve met some cool people, but I really wish you were here. I mean, you had to know. I\u2019ve called you every single day since I left, and I practically begged you to visit me this weekend,\u201d Eliott huffed out. Oh, so that\u2019s why he kept mentioning the bars and coffee shops. </p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ll be there. Because I really miss you, too, in case I haven\u2019t said that enough yet,\u201d Lucas smiled for the first time in days. </p><p>Yeah, he knew it was cliche, but he needed Eliott around almost as much as he needed air. Or water. Or anything else that makes it possible for a human being to live.   </p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>\u201cLucas! Sweetie, you\u2019re here,\u201d he was snapped back to reality by small hands wrapped around his upper back and the light press of lips on his cheek. He realized that while he was deep in thought, someone has steered him away from the desk and brought him to the waiting room. Yann, Basile, and Arthur were sitting in the uncomfortable plastic chairs, but he was still standing. </p><p>He also realized that Eloise was the one who greeted him a few seconds ago. She was standing in front of him with tear-stained cheeks and watery eyes. Lucas could tell she left work in a hurry because all she had in her hands were her car keys. \u201cI tried to call you. So did your mom,\u201d Eloise explained. Lucas realized he hadn\u2019t even thought about his phone since they left campus. He hoped it was someone, probably in his backpack. He wanted to ask Yann about it, just so Eloise would stop looking at him with those worried eyes that made him want to sink into the ground, but he thought that\u2019d be inappropriate, so he stopped himself before the words left his mouth. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Lucas forced himself to say.</p><p>\u201cSorry for what, Lucas?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not really sure,\u201d he confessed. \u201cThey wouldn\u2019t tell me anything when I arrived. I\u2019m not family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re my family, honey. And Eliott\u2019s. These people may not know that, but I do,\u201d she rubbed her thumb over his cheekbone. </p><p>It was sick, really, Lucas thought as he looked at the woman who was like a second mother to him. Her son was in the hospital and yet she was comforting Lucas. </p><p>He looked to his left when he heard the waiting room doors sliding open and saw Lucille entering with one of her friends. She was also tearing up as she took in her surroundings, clearly flustered. Could everyone feel emotion but him? </p><p>He pushed aside that thought as Lucille met his gaze. They stared at each other for a second, blank expressions on both their faces, before she looked away, turning to the girl with her. </p><p>Lucas turned back to face Eloise. As much as he didn\u2019t want to ask, he knew that he had to. That\u2019s what you did in those situations. You found out whether or not the person you loved was gravely injured. </p><p>However, before he could speak, Lucille approached them with an anxious expression on her face. \u201cMrs. Demaury, how is he? What happened to him?\u201d</p><p>At that, the three guys stood up and crowded around Lucas. The action, although it came from a place of love, made him feel like he was suffocating. </p><p>Eloise took a long breath before she directed her words at Lucas, much to Lucille\u2019s annoyance. \u201cHe\u2019s in surgery right now. One of the bookshelves in the art studio gave out while he was working and it fell on his leg. It crushed some of his bones and ligaments. It\u2019s a severe fracture, but they don\u2019t know the full extent of the damage yet.\u201d </p><p>A feeling of relief washed over Lucas\u2019 body. \u201cThat\u2019s good,\u201d he declared before he had the chance to think about it. \u201cI mean, not good but\u2026better than\u2026other\u2026things.\u201d He heard Lucille scoff at his stuttering, so he shut his mouth before he had the chance to make any more idiotic statements. </p><p>Eloise offered him a small smile. \u201cYes Lucas, you\u2019re right. It definitely is.\u201d </p><p>After that, it was a waiting game. Lucas\u2019 mom and Nana Mary arrived a half-hour after Eloise, and Andrew appeared an hour after that. When his mom sat down next to him, Lucas burrowed himself into her side, looking for the feeling of security the action provided him with when he was a child. </p><p>A doctor came out to give them an update at some point. She explained that there was a lot of damage to Eliott\u2019s left tibia, but thankfully they hadn\u2019t run into any complications with the initial repair. When Lucas heard that the surgery would take at least another hour, he almost groaned. He couldn\u2019t keep waiting around like that. It made him feel small and helpless. </p><p>The gang was still there, so Lucas told them to head home. They protested adamantly, but begrudgingly left when he promised to send them constant updates. </p><p>The next two hours passed slowly, excruciatingly so, but the same doctor as before came out and told them that Eliott had been moved to recovery. He was slightly groggy, but he was allowed to have two visitors at a time. Eloise and Andrew quickly followed the doctor toward another wing of the hospital. Lucas wanted to go as well, but he knew Eliott\u2019s parents deserved to see their son first, so he kept quiet. After all, he\u2019d been waiting for hours. He could handle 20 more minutes. </p><p>After a little while, Eloise came back to the waiting room and walked up to where Lucas and his mom were sitting. \u201cLucas, he\u2019s still a little dazed, but he\u2019d like to see you if you\u2019re up for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Lucas shot out of his chair and started moving towards the direction he watched Eloise come from only seconds earlier.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to see him,\u201d he heard from behind him. He stopped and turned to see Lucille scurrying after them. In all his worry, he\u2019d forgotten she was even there. Honestly, he wished he could again. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Lucille, but we don\u2019t want to overwhelm him right after surgery. Maybe you should head home. They\u2019re keeping him here overnight so you can come back tomorrow and see him,\u201d Eloise offered politely. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m his girlfriend. There\u2019s no way I\u2019m leaving. I know he wants to see me,\u201d Lucille shot back, ignoring the older woman\u2019s suggestion.</p><p>\u201cWell, he specifically asked to see Lucas, so that\u2019s who I\u2019m taking to see him. After that, I don\u2019t know if he\u2019ll be up for any more visitors, but you\u2019re welcome to sit in the waiting room.\u201d At that, Eloise put her arm around Lucas\u2019 shoulder and guided him away. She stopped them in front of an elevator and pressed the \u201cUp\u201d button. They waited in silence until the elevator arrived. After everyone cleared out of it, they stepped in and Eloise press the button marked \u201cfour.\u201d</p><p>She was the one who broke the silence. \u201cI\u2019m sorry but that girl is too much. And I know she and my son broke up, so she should probably stop calling herself \u2018his girlfriend\u2019 now.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah, she\u2019s doesn\u2019t like me,\u201d Lucas admitted as they exited the elevator and quickly turned a corner, coming upon a hallway marked \u201cRecovery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t imagine why,\u201d Eloise smirked. Before Lucas could question her, she remarked \u201c421, here we are\u201d and pushed a slightly ajar wooden door further open. Lucas slowly followed her in until he was staring at his best friend, who was sitting in a hospital bed with his eyes half-open. His face was turned away from Lucas as he stared out the window, so he didn\u2019t notice the younger boy\u2019s entrance. </p><p>Eloise quickly remedied that. \u201cEli, look who\u2019s here to see you.\u201d</p><p>Eliott rotated his who body to look towards where his mother\u2019s voice came from. He and Lucas quickly locked eyes, and a closed lip smile appeared on both their faces. \u201cHi, Lu,\u201d Eliott whispered. </p><p>\u201cHi, Eli,\u201d Lucas whispered back. </p><p>Andrew chose that moment to clear his throat, and Lucas was thankful because he\u2019d forgotten the older man was even there. He was sitting in a large recliner in the corner of the room, staring out the window as Eliott had been doing earlier. \u201cI\u2019m going to check in with the doctors and ask them about the next steps of your recovery, Eliott.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll walk out with you. I want to go back down to the waiting room and tell Mary and Isabelle to head home. They\u2019re probably exhausted and I\u2019m sure Lucas will be here for a little while. One of us can bring Lucas home later,\u201d Eloise proclaimed. </p><p>Lucas wasn\u2019t sure if they knew he wasn\u2019t staying at the apartment. If not, that\u2019d probably be an awkward conversation later. </p><p>Both parents left, and all that remained was Eliott and Lucas, staring at each other across a hospital room. Lucas realized at that moment that he was standing as far away from Eliott as the room allowed, so he took a few steps towards his bed. He stopped himself at what he felt was a respectable distance, afraid to overwhelm the other boy. </p><p>Truthfully, he had no idea what he could say to Eliott that wouldn\u2019t reveal the fact that he hadn\u2019t been able to form a coherent sentence in the past few hours. There was no reason for Eliott to know how scared Lucas was; it wouldn\u2019t help his recovery. </p><p>The boy in the hospital bed winced as he shifted to sit up higher. \u201cGood thing I\u2019m an artist and not an up-and-coming football star because this would definitely be career-ending,\u201d he laughed weakly. </p><p>Lucas wanted to laugh with him, really, he did. But he couldn\u2019t. His body wouldn\u2019t allow him to feel any joy. It wouldn\u2019t let him feel much of anything but worry and panic. So he just stood there, nodding at Eliott with a blank expression on his face. </p><p>\u201cLucas, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d Eliott said seriously. And Lucas scoffed at that because seriously? </p><p>\u201cAre you really asking me that right now? As you sit in a hospital bed with those\u2026things sticking out of your leg?\u201d</p><p>Eliott frowned at that. \u201cI\u2019m fine. It doesn\u2019t even hurt that much, rea-\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not fine!\u201d Lucas cut him off. Every emotion he\u2019d been unable to feel earlier was now fighting to be released from the pent-up confines of his mind and body. \u201cYou\u2019re hurting. They had to preform major surgery on your leg. You\u2019ll need months of physical therapy!\u201d Lucas felt his chest constrict as a sob escaped his mouth. Of course now is the time I finally cry. He looked down at the scuffed tiles of the room and thought about how much he both never wanted to leave and didn\u2019t want to be there anymore. </p><p>The younger boy looked back up at his best friend and saw that he was also tearing up. It made him feel like an asshole. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean to upset you with my yelling. I\u2019m just scared.\u201d </p><p>\u201cCome here,\u201d Eliott beckoned Lucas closer to the bed and the younger boy sheepishly complied. Once he was within reach, Eliott took him by the wrist and guided his hand towards the older boy\u2019s cheek. \u201cI\u2019m here. I\u2019m alright.\u201d </p><p>Lucas instantly relaxed. It was magical, the way Eliott could do that. </p><p>\u201cI know that now. But the past few hours have been the worst of my life. You\u2019re my best friend, and we\u2019ve barely talked in the last week and a half. What if something had happened to you? I wouldn\u2019t have been able to live with myself.\u201d </p><p>Eliott didn\u2019t respond to Lucas\u2019 question, but he kept his hand lightly gripped around Lucas\u2019 wrist as a sign that the younger boy shouldn\u2019t remove his hand from its position on Eliott\u2019s cheek. He was so breathtaking, even sitting in a hospital bed in an unflattering patient gown with tears running down his face. </p><p>Lucas realized that there was no chance he was going to be able to stay away from Eliott any longer. After the events of the day, he wanted to be around him as much as possible; his stubbornness and pining needed to be put aside. </p><p>His feelings for the other boy hadn\u2019t subsided, and they clearly weren\u2019t going to any time soon. Now, more than ever, he knew that he loved Eliott in a hundred different ways. That probably should have frightened him, but it didn\u2019t. If anything, it actually excited him to feel something that strongly, especially for his Eliott. </p><p>The way that Eliott loved him back, platonically, had to be enough for him. Eliott needed him to be strong while he healed. If he truly loved the older boy as much as he told himself he did, he\u2019d put Eliott\u2019s recovery before his own feelings.  </p><p>Lucas gently removed his hand from Eliott\u2019s face. The older boy went to protest, but stopped when he saw Lucas moving to lean on the side of his hospital bed. He shifted his good leg so Lucas could sit, and the shorter boy rested with one food tucked under him and the other planted on the ground. \u201cI know you\u2019ll be staying with your parents for a little while, but I\u2019m coming home. I\u2019ll stay at Yann\u2019s tonight, because some of my stuff is there, but I\u2019ll be back at our apartment tomorrow.\u201d </p><p>Again, the older boy was silent for a couple of seconds, but Lucas knew what he was going to say. \u201cThat makes me really happy, but I don\u2019t want this whole thing to make you feel like you have to come home,\u201d Eliott stated seriously. \u201cIf you\u2019re still not ready, I\u2019d rather you just stay with Yann until you know you\u2019ll come back for good.\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m ready,\u201d Lucas reassured him.  \u201cBeing away from you didn\u2019t suddenly make me feel like we weren\u2019t close anymore. And I like how close we are anyway. Screw anyone who thinks differently. This whole thing was a stupid idea brought on by my reaction to\u2026.,\u201d Lucas trailed off. He remembered then that Lucille was still there. </p><p>Just because he was trying to be adult about the situation didn\u2019t make that reminder hurt any less. The boy began to stand up and back away from the hospital bed. </p><p>\u201cThe point is, I\u2019m moving back home. Anyway, your girlfriend is downstairs in the waiting room. I can send her in on my way out. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re tired, but\u2026\u201d </p><p>\u201cLucille\u2019s here? Why? And don\u2019t call her my girlfriend. You know we broke up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could\u2019ve gotten back together. I don\u2019t know.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI talked to her once after that party to tell her not to bother crawling back because we were done for good,\u201d Eliott declared with an insistent look in his eyes. Lucas had to admit that made him feel good. </p><p>\u201cSo, you don\u2019t want to see her?\u201d Lucas inquired, slightly hopeful. </p><p>\u201cFuck, no. She made both of us feel like shit. I\u2019m done with her. And I told you your moving out was a moronic idea. Glad we\u2019re finally on the same page. Also, don\u2019t leave,\u201d Eliott laughed. </p><p>Lucas couldn\u2019t stop his own grin from forming. He moved back towards the bed, but before he could return to his former spot, Eliott tugged on his sleeve to bring him closer to the top half of his reclined body. \u201cLay with me, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Eli. I\u2019ll hurt you! Your leg is all fractured and stuff,\u201d Lucas screeched as he playfully resisted Eliott\u2019s weak grip. </p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019ll lay on my right side. Trust me, there\u2019s enough room in this bed for both of us, tiny boy.\u201d</p><p>Lucas gave in pretty quickly after that. He made sure to be extremely careful as he got onto the bed, and he kept his right leg dangling off the side as his left side pressed against Eliott. It wasn\u2019t the most comfortable position, but it was exactly where Lucas wanted to be. </p><p>\u201cLu, I\u2019m not going to lie to you, I\u2019ll probably be asleep in the next 30 seconds,\u201d Eliott stated as he yawned and nuzzled into Lucas. </p><p>\u201cMe too, Eli. Worrying about you all day was tiring,\u201d Lucas responded. He knew it was probably a bad idea to fall asleep in Eliott\u2019s hospital bed, but he couldn\u2019t bring himself to care. </p>",

Lol sorry.<br></p><p>Again, thank you all for being incredible, and enjoy\u2764\ufe0f</p>[[MORE]]<p>The outdoor dining area on campus was packed as lunchtime rolled around. Lucas was making his way through the crowd to where Yann had grabbed them a table when a girl ran by him, knocking her backpack directly into his shoulder. </p><p>Lucas grumbled but didn\u2019t have the energy to yell after her. Plus, he knew she was probably in a hurry and couldn\u2019t really fault her for that. He was always rushing through campus to get from class to class. Once he spotted Yann and Basile sitting at a table in the shade, he forgot about the girl and sat down with his friends. </p><p>\u201cI think we should start a band,\u201d Basile remarked as Lucas unwrapped his sandwich. Neither he nor Yann responded to Basile\u2019s outburst, both boys staring at their lunches to avoid their friend\u2019s gaze. That was usually how these things went, partially because no wanted to encourage Basile\u2019s dumb ideas and partially because it was funny. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be a great way to meet girls and we\u2019ll get a ton of free alc-,\u201d</p><p>\u201cDude, something happened with Eliott,\u201d Lucas heard a voice he knew belonged to Arthur remark as footsteps approached their table.  </p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Lucas inquired as he lifted his eyes to meet Arthur\u2019s. The look that they shared at that moment made the blue-eyed boy\u2019s heart drop to his stomach. </p><p>\u201cI was on my way here and I saw an ambulance leaving the art building. I stopped to find out what was going on and heard some guy saying \u2018the Demaury kid\u2019 was in it,\u201d Arthur replied. </p><p>Lucas\u2019 ears started ringing after \u2018ambulance,\u2019 but he caught everything the other boy said. He quickly stood up and started backing away from his friends, but he paused when he realized he had no idea what his plan was. Lucas faintly registered Yann coming towards him and then felt a hand on his shoulder. </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t touch me!\u201d Lucas sucked in a shaky breath and squeezed his eyes shut as Yann retreated. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I just\u2026 they\u2019re taking him to General, right? That\u2019s the closest hospital. I need to get there. What\u2019s the fastest way to get there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call a taxi,\u201d Basile quickly offered as he jogged away. \u201cMeet me in front of the sports complex,\u201d he yelled. </p><p>Arthur started gathering all of their backpacks as Yann cleared the food of the table. Lucas didn\u2019t move from where he had paused earlier. He\u2019d always been a worst case scenario type of thinker, and that wasn\u2019t helping him as his mind searched for a reason why Eliott would be in an ambulance. </p><p>Did someone hurt Eliott? What if Eliott hurt himself? Maybe it was a medical thing. Did he have an episode? </p><p>He didn\u2019t remember being guided to the taxi, or most of the short ride to the hospital. It was only when the vehicle stopped in front of the hospital that came back to reality. The gang, clearly trying not to overwhelm Lucas, tried to wait for the boy to make a move before they exited the taxi. After a minute or so, the taxi driver cleared his throat, signaling that he needed to pick up other passengers. That prompted Yann to open his door and let himself out, then jog over to the other side of the vehicle and open Lucas\u2019 door. The shorted boy finally budged at that point and made his way towards the building. </p><p>The hospital was not as busy as Lucas expected it to be. Nurses, doctors, and orderlies were rushing around, trying to do their jobs, but there was no screaming, no blood smeared across the floor. He had guessed that TV dramas exaggerated that stuff, but at that moment he knew for sure.</p><p>Lucas realized then that Eliott could be anywhere in the hospital, depending on the condition he was in. The blue-eyed boy quickly looked towards Yann, silently begging him to figure out what they should do. </p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s head to the desk over there and see if they can give us any information,\u201d Yann suggested, pointing to a round counter  with doctors and nurses surrounding it. Lucas let the other boy lead the way as he slowly followed behind with Basile and Arthur. </p><p>\u201cHi, we\u2019re hoping to find out where our friend, Eliott Demaury, is,\u201d Yann sweetly offered to one of the men sitting behind the counter. </p><p>The gentleman, clearly unimpressed by Yann\u2019s sunny demeanor, looked down at his tablet and started swiping slowly. Lucas wanted to grab him by the front of his scrubs and will him to move quicker, but he couldn\u2019t bring himself to move. </p><p>It all made his feel so useless. Ever since Arthur ran up to the table and told him what had happened, he\u2019d been unable to exert any energy beyond what was required to keep him alive. Eliott was his best friend, and yet Yann, Basile, and Arthur were the ones taking action to get them to him. </p><p>As he looked at the other three boys\u2019 faces, he saw anxiousness, but he also saw determination. If they looked back at his, he was sure all they would see was terror. He was paralyzed by his own panic. The best person in his life could be gravely injured, and he wasn\u2019t doing anything to get to him. Eliott deserved better than what Lucas was giving him, but apprehension made it impossible for Lucas to offer that up. </p><p>The fact that the gang was there with him was probably the only reason he wasn\u2019t still sitting at that outdoor table on campus or in the backseat of the taxi. He bet he\u2019d feel incredibly lucky to have them at that moment if he wasn\u2019t incapable of any human emotion beyond fear. </p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s in surgery right now, guys, but that\u2019s all I can tell you,\u201d the man stated, bringing Lucas back to reality. \u201cI can only release information to family members.\u201d </p><p>\u201cLucas is family!\u201d Basile shouted, looking to Lucas expectantly. </p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your relation to Mr. Demaury?\u201d The man, who Lucas now presumed was a nurse, questioned as he pursed his lips and raised his eyebrows. </p><p>\u201cI\u2026ah\u2026we\u2019re,\u201d but Lucas had no idea what to say. He stood there, stuttering and panicking as four sets of eyes focused on him.  </p><p>Eliott was his family; he\u2019d been sure of that for most of his life. But there was no word for what they were to each other. It never bothered Lucas before, but at that moment, it was the most frustrating truth in the world. He wanted to force himself to say \u2018cousin\u2019 or \u2018stepbrother\u2019 or anything that would get him more information, but he couldn\u2019t bring himself to do it. </p><p>Truthfully, he was scared to know more. If he lied his way into the family category, then he would have to find out Eliott\u2019s condition. He couldn\u2019t handle the possible implications of that decision. At that moment, he was in the state of ignorance, and it was slowly killing him, but he was still breathing, still functioning. Once he found out more, though, he might actually break down. If the news was bad, which was a real possibility, Lucas wouldn\u2019t be able to cope with that. He couldn\u2019t live his life without Eliott, that much he knew.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>Looking back, he first had that realization when he was a teenager; right after Eliott started university, and he left Lucas alone at school to fend for himself.</p><p>(At least, that was how Lucas saw it at the time. Truthfully, he still had Imane and Yann to keep him company.) </p><p>Not having Eliott around was borderline unbearable. But he was incredibly happy for his best friend. No one deserved to finally head to university more than Eliott. </p><p>After failing to complete his bac the first time around, Eliott had to redo Terminale. When he broke the news to Lucas, (who already knew but wanted Eliott to be able to tell him for himself), he did it with a weak chuckle and a \u201cat least we\u2019ll be in school together for one more year.\u201d Lucas couldn\u2019t stop the tears from falling on his cheeks, though, because he knew. He knew how hard Eliott had worked throughout school and how passionate he was about studying art at university. And, because of his bipolar disorder, he wasn\u2019t going to be able to do that for another year. </p><p>Lucas felt like he should have done something. He should\u2019ve known that Eliott had stopped taking his meds and that he was entering a manic state. But he missed the signs. </p><p>Most of his time had been spent studying for his end-of-year tests and writing papers. He tried not to annoy Eliott, because he knew the boy was under a lot of pressure with his exams. Whenever he would check in with him through text, Eliott always told Lucas he was doing great and studying hard.</p><p>But what he was really doing was drawing. He had filled multiple notebooks with drawings of everything and everyone in his life. Some were colorful, others were black-and-white, and others were only half finished. The boy stayed up for days completing his project while he was meant to be preparing for his bac. Two days before exams began, Eliott went to one of the train stations by school and tried to paint a mural on the wall. He was picked up by the police and brought to the hospital, where he eventually entered a depressive state. </p><p>A few weeks later, when the dust settled and Eliott knew he was going to have to repeat the year, he and Lucas were sitting at the park, enjoying the cool weather when the younger boy asked the ever-present question. \u201cWhy did you stop taking your meds?\u201d</p><p>Eliott sighed and started his response without looking at Lucas. \u201dI just wanted to be able to go to university like a regular student. And before you tell me I am a regular student, you know that I\u2019m not. But I felt like I could be. I started reading up on the different classes I\u2019d be able to take and looking into the on-campus apartments, and it all sounded so amazing. I\u2019d have to leave you, which sucked, but the university is only 20 minutes away from our neighborhood by bus, so I knew we\u2019d see each other all the time, and you would visit. Everything just felt like it was going great, so I stopped taking my meds because I didn\u2019t think I needed them.\u201d</p><p>Once Eliott finally looked at him, Lucas didn\u2019t know what to say. After a minute, something did come to mind, and he knew it had to be said. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to come back to school because of me. If you want to go somewhere else, be at a different school for your retake, I get that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLu, the fact that I have to do this, it\u2019s awful. But I know it\u2019d be ten times worse if I didn\u2019t have you there to eat lunch with, to sit with before school, and to take the bus with. That is what\u2019s making this whole ordeal so much more bearable.\u201d Lucas smiled at that because even thought he couldn\u2019t do anything for Eliott during his episode, he could do something now. He could be there for him that school year. </p><p>Eliott did pass his bac that year (with flying colors) and headed off to university. The day he moved out, he handed Lucas a very antiquated printout of directions from his house to Eliott\u2019s dorm building. The trip was 22 minutes total, which was a lot longer than the 6-minute walk between their two houses. And Lucas knew that there were a bunch of apps that could tell him the same information a lot quicker. But he loved that Eliott took the time to print the directions out, so he smiled brightly and hugged his best friend. </p><p>Lucas felt spoiled by the fact that he and Eliott had spent two years of lyc\u00e9e together instead of just one. Although the circumstances were terrible, he still had his best friend with him for an extra year. He\u2019d never been at that school sans Eliott, and on his first day without him, he felt completely lost. He rode the bus to school alone, sat at lunch with Yann picking at his food and not eating, and stood outside in the schoolyard at the end of the day, not wanting to make the trip home by himself. </p><p>Eliott called him that night, to ask how his first day of Terminale went, and Lucas held back his tears as he blatantly lied to Eliott about all the great things that he did to kick off his last year of lyc\u00e9e. Eliott could tell something was wrong, and asked Lucas multiple times to tell him what it was, but the shorted boy kept his mouth shut. There was no way he was going to drag Eliott down into his cave of self-pity. Once he hung up the phone, the tears freely flowed as he laid back and stared at his bedroom ceiling. </p><p>The realization that hit Lucas at that moment was jarring. Over the past two years, he and Eliott, who were already extremely close, had grown even closer. So close, in fact, that Lucas felt like part of him was missing the entire day he spent at school without his best friend. It was hard for Lucas to acknowledge how empty he felt without Eliott, because he knew he was only setting himself up for disappointment. </p><p>Lucas admittedly started spiraling from there. He concluded that one day, Eliott was going to find a serious girlfriend, get married, have kids, get a full-time job. Then, Lucas would probably never see him again. So really, this year was going to be good practice for his future without Eliott. </p><p>Future without Eliott? It wasn\u2019t like he was dying. Shit, Lucas didn\u2019t even want to think about Eliott dying, ever. He quickly pushed that thought aside. </p><p>It was pathetic, really, because Eliott was totally fine going off to university without Lucas. Sure, he said he missed him, but he called Lucas after his first day of classes and told him all about how awesome they were. And he called him the next day and told him how awesome those classes were as well. Then, he told Lucas during their Wednesday phone call that he wanted him to visit soon so he could show him all the cool coffee shops and bars he already found around campus.</p><p>Although Lucas was happy for his best friend, he was also kind of hurt that it seemed like Eliott was having such a great time without him. Wow, how fucked up is he? He\u2019s so fucking selfish. Lucas decided at that point that he wouldn\u2019t bother Eliott anymore. He didn\u2019t want to burden the other boy with his overdramatic teenage angst. </p><p>Right after he finished that thought, his phone started ringing. When he checked the screen, he saw that it was Eliott again. He contemplated not answering, because he knew he was still sniffling and hoarse, but Eliott would probably just call again. \u201cHey, Eli! Calling again so soon?\u201d He tried to sound as cheery as possible. </p><p>\u201cI miss you, Lu. Like, really miss you. And I know I\u2019ve only been gone like a week and I know I\u2019m only 20 minutes away, but I miss you,\u201d Eliott blurted out. </p><p>All of the breath was knocked out of Lucas\u2019 body as he listened to Eliott\u2019s words, so it took him a few seconds to whisper back, \u201cI miss you too, you nerd.\u201d</p><p>Eliott loudly chuckled at that. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me sooner? I\u2019ve been missing you since I left, but I didn\u2019t want to say anything because I\u2019m supposed to be the cool university student.\u201d </p><p>\u201cEvery time we talk, you tell me about how much you love school and how much fun you\u2019re having. I didn\u2019t want to bring you down with my sadness, but school really sucks without you,\u201d Lucas admitted. </p><p>\u201cI am enjoying school, and I\u2019ve met some cool people, but I really wish you were here. I mean, you had to know. I\u2019ve called you every single day since I left, and I practically begged you to visit me this weekend,\u201d Eliott huffed out. Oh, so that\u2019s why he kept mentioning the bars and coffee shops. </p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ll be there. Because I really miss you, too, in case I haven\u2019t said that enough yet,\u201d Lucas smiled for the first time in days. </p><p>Yeah, he knew it was cliche, but he needed Eliott around almost as much as he needed air. Or water. Or anything else that makes it possible for a human being to live.   </p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>\u201cLucas! Sweetie, you\u2019re here,\u201d he was snapped back to reality by small hands wrapped around his upper back and the light press of lips on his cheek. He realized that while he was deep in thought, someone has steered him away from the desk and brought him to the waiting room. Yann, Basile, and Arthur were sitting in the uncomfortable plastic chairs, but he was still standing. </p><p>He also realized that Eloise was the one who greeted him a few seconds ago. She was standing in front of him with tear-stained cheeks and watery eyes. Lucas could tell she left work in a hurry because all she had in her hands were her car keys. \u201cI tried to call you. So did your mom,\u201d Eloise explained. Lucas realized he hadn\u2019t even thought about his phone since they left campus. He hoped it was someone, probably in his backpack. He wanted to ask Yann about it, just so Eloise would stop looking at him with those worried eyes that made him want to sink into the ground, but he thought that\u2019d be inappropriate, so he stopped himself before the words left his mouth. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Lucas forced himself to say.</p><p>\u201cSorry for what, Lucas?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not really sure,\u201d he confessed. \u201cThey wouldn\u2019t tell me anything when I arrived. I\u2019m not family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re my family, honey. And Eliott\u2019s. These people may not know that, but I do,\u201d she rubbed her thumb over his cheekbone. </p><p>It was sick, really, Lucas thought as he looked at the woman who was like a second mother to him. Her son was in the hospital and yet she was comforting Lucas. </p><p>He looked to his left when he heard the waiting room doors sliding open and saw Lucille entering with one of her friends. She was also tearing up as she took in her surroundings, clearly flustered. Could everyone feel emotion but him? </p><p>He pushed aside that thought as Lucille met his gaze. They stared at each other for a second, blank expressions on both their faces, before she looked away, turning to the girl with her. </p><p>Lucas turned back to face Eloise. As much as he didn\u2019t want to ask, he knew that he had to. That\u2019s what you did in those situations. You found out whether or not the person you loved was gravely injured. </p><p>However, before he could speak, Lucille approached them with an anxious expression on her face. \u201cMrs. Demaury, how is he? What happened to him?\u201d</p><p>At that, the three guys stood up and crowded around Lucas. The action, although it came from a place of love, made him feel like he was suffocating. </p><p>Eloise took a long breath before she directed her words at Lucas, much to Lucille\u2019s annoyance. \u201cHe\u2019s in surgery right now. One of the bookshelves in the art studio gave out while he was working and it fell on his leg. It crushed some of his bones and ligaments. It\u2019s a severe fracture, but they don\u2019t know the full extent of the damage yet.\u201d </p><p>A feeling of relief washed over Lucas\u2019 body. \u201cThat\u2019s good,\u201d he declared before he had the chance to think about it. \u201cI mean, not good but\u2026better than\u2026other\u2026things.\u201d He heard Lucille scoff at his stuttering, so he shut his mouth before he had the chance to make any more idiotic statements. </p><p>Eloise offered him a small smile. \u201cYes Lucas, you\u2019re right. It definitely is.\u201d </p><p>After that, it was a waiting game. Lucas\u2019 mom and Nana Mary arrived a half-hour after Eloise, and Andrew appeared an hour after that. When his mom sat down next to him, Lucas burrowed himself into her side, looking for the feeling of security the action provided him with when he was a child. </p><p>A doctor came out to give them an update at some point. She explained that there was a lot of damage to Eliott\u2019s left tibia, but thankfully they hadn\u2019t run into any complications with the initial repair. When Lucas heard that the surgery would take at least another hour, he almost groaned. He couldn\u2019t keep waiting around like that. It made him feel small and helpless. </p><p>The gang was still there, so Lucas told them to head home. They protested adamantly, but begrudgingly left when he promised to send them constant updates. </p><p>The next two hours passed slowly, excruciatingly so, but the same doctor as before came out and told them that Eliott had been moved to recovery. He was slightly groggy, but he was allowed to have two visitors at a time. Eloise and Andrew quickly followed the doctor toward another wing of the hospital. Lucas wanted to go as well, but he knew Eliott\u2019s parents deserved to see their son first, so he kept quiet. After all, he\u2019d been waiting for hours. He could handle 20 more minutes. </p><p>After a little while, Eloise came back to the waiting room and walked up to where Lucas and his mom were sitting. \u201cLucas, he\u2019s still a little dazed, but he\u2019d like to see you if you\u2019re up for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Lucas shot out of his chair and started moving towards the direction he watched Eloise come from only seconds earlier.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to see him,\u201d he heard from behind him. He stopped and turned to see Lucille scurrying after them. In all his worry, he\u2019d forgotten she was even there. Honestly, he wished he could again. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Lucille, but we don\u2019t want to overwhelm him right after surgery. Maybe you should head home. They\u2019re keeping him here overnight so you can come back tomorrow and see him,\u201d Eloise offered politely. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m his girlfriend. There\u2019s no way I\u2019m leaving. I know he wants to see me,\u201d Lucille shot back, ignoring the older woman\u2019s suggestion.</p><p>\u201cWell, he specifically asked to see Lucas, so that\u2019s who I\u2019m taking to see him. After that, I don\u2019t know if he\u2019ll be up for any more visitors, but you\u2019re welcome to sit in the waiting room.\u201d At that, Eloise put her arm around Lucas\u2019 shoulder and guided him away. She stopped them in front of an elevator and pressed the \u201cUp\u201d button. They waited in silence until the elevator arrived. After everyone cleared out of it, they stepped in and Eloise press the button marked \u201cfour.\u201d</p><p>She was the one who broke the silence. \u201cI\u2019m sorry but that girl is too much. And I know she and my son broke up, so she should probably stop calling herself \u2018his girlfriend\u2019 now.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah, she\u2019s doesn\u2019t like me,\u201d Lucas admitted as they exited the elevator and quickly turned a corner, coming upon a hallway marked \u201cRecovery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t imagine why,\u201d Eloise smirked. Before Lucas could question her, she remarked \u201c421, here we are\u201d and pushed a slightly ajar wooden door further open. Lucas slowly followed her in until he was staring at his best friend, who was sitting in a hospital bed with his eyes half-open. His face was turned away from Lucas as he stared out the window, so he didn\u2019t notice the younger boy\u2019s entrance. </p><p>Eloise quickly remedied that. \u201cEli, look who\u2019s here to see you.\u201d</p><p>Eliott rotated his who body to look towards where his mother\u2019s voice came from. He and Lucas quickly locked eyes, and a closed lip smile appeared on both their faces. \u201cHi, Lu,\u201d Eliott whispered. </p><p>\u201cHi, Eli,\u201d Lucas whispered back. </p><p>Andrew chose that moment to clear his throat, and Lucas was thankful because he\u2019d forgotten the older man was even there. He was sitting in a large recliner in the corner of the room, staring out the window as Eliott had been doing earlier. \u201cI\u2019m going to check in with the doctors and ask them about the next steps of your recovery, Eliott.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll walk out with you. I want to go back down to the waiting room and tell Mary and Isabelle to head home. They\u2019re probably exhausted and I\u2019m sure Lucas will be here for a little while. One of us can bring Lucas home later,\u201d Eloise proclaimed. </p><p>Lucas wasn\u2019t sure if they knew he wasn\u2019t staying at the apartment. If not, that\u2019d probably be an awkward conversation later. </p><p>Both parents left, and all that remained was Eliott and Lucas, staring at each other across a hospital room. Lucas realized at that moment that he was standing as far away from Eliott as the room allowed, so he took a few steps towards his bed. He stopped himself at what he felt was a respectable distance, afraid to overwhelm the other boy. </p><p>Truthfully, he had no idea what he could say to Eliott that wouldn\u2019t reveal the fact that he hadn\u2019t been able to form a coherent sentence in the past few hours. There was no reason for Eliott to know how scared Lucas was; it wouldn\u2019t help his recovery. </p><p>The boy in the hospital bed winced as he shifted to sit up higher. \u201cGood thing I\u2019m an artist and not an up-and-coming football star because this would definitely be career-ending,\u201d he laughed weakly. </p><p>Lucas wanted to laugh with him, really, he did. But he couldn\u2019t. His body wouldn\u2019t allow him to feel any joy. It wouldn\u2019t let him feel much of anything but worry and panic. So he just stood there, nodding at Eliott with a blank expression on his face. </p><p>\u201cLucas, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d Eliott said seriously. And Lucas scoffed at that because seriously? </p><p>\u201cAre you really asking me that right now? As you sit in a hospital bed with those\u2026things sticking out of your leg?\u201d</p><p>Eliott frowned at that. \u201cI\u2019m fine. It doesn\u2019t even hurt that much, rea-\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not fine!\u201d Lucas cut him off. Every emotion he\u2019d been unable to feel earlier was now fighting to be released from the pent-up confines of his mind and body. \u201cYou\u2019re hurting. They had to preform major surgery on your leg. You\u2019ll need months of physical therapy!\u201d Lucas felt his chest constrict as a sob escaped his mouth. Of course now is the time I finally cry. He looked down at the scuffed tiles of the room and thought about how much he both never wanted to leave and didn\u2019t want to be there anymore. </p><p>The younger boy looked back up at his best friend and saw that he was also tearing up. It made him feel like an asshole. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean to upset you with my yelling. I\u2019m just scared.\u201d </p><p>\u201cCome here,\u201d Eliott beckoned Lucas closer to the bed and the younger boy sheepishly complied. Once he was within reach, Eliott took him by the wrist and guided his hand towards the older boy\u2019s cheek. \u201cI\u2019m here. I\u2019m alright.\u201d </p><p>Lucas instantly relaxed. It was magical, the way Eliott could do that. </p><p>\u201cI know that now. But the past few hours have been the worst of my life. You\u2019re my best friend, and we\u2019ve barely talked in the last week and a half. What if something had happened to you? I wouldn\u2019t have been able to live with myself.\u201d </p><p>Eliott didn\u2019t respond to Lucas\u2019 question, but he kept his hand lightly gripped around Lucas\u2019 wrist as a sign that the younger boy shouldn\u2019t remove his hand from its position on Eliott\u2019s cheek. He was so breathtaking, even sitting in a hospital bed in an unflattering patient gown with tears running down his face. </p><p>Lucas realized that there was no chance he was going to be able to stay away from Eliott any longer. After the events of the day, he wanted to be around him as much as possible; his stubbornness and pining needed to be put aside. </p><p>His feelings for the other boy hadn\u2019t subsided, and they clearly weren\u2019t going to any time soon. Now, more than ever, he knew that he loved Eliott in a hundred different ways. That probably should have frightened him, but it didn\u2019t. If anything, it actually excited him to feel something that strongly, especially for his Eliott. </p><p>The way that Eliott loved him back, platonically, had to be enough for him. Eliott needed him to be strong while he healed. If he truly loved the older boy as much as he told himself he did, he\u2019d put Eliott\u2019s recovery before his own feelings.  </p><p>Lucas gently removed his hand from Eliott\u2019s face. The older boy went to protest, but stopped when he saw Lucas moving to lean on the side of his hospital bed. He shifted his good leg so Lucas could sit, and the shorter boy rested with one food tucked under him and the other planted on the ground. \u201cI know you\u2019ll be staying with your parents for a little while, but I\u2019m coming home. I\u2019ll stay at Yann\u2019s tonight, because some of my stuff is there, but I\u2019ll be back at our apartment tomorrow.\u201d </p><p>Again, the older boy was silent for a couple of seconds, but Lucas knew what he was going to say. \u201cThat makes me really happy, but I don\u2019t want this whole thing to make you feel like you have to come home,\u201d Eliott stated seriously. \u201cIf you\u2019re still not ready, I\u2019d rather you just stay with Yann until you know you\u2019ll come back for good.\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m ready,\u201d Lucas reassured him.  \u201cBeing away from you didn\u2019t suddenly make me feel like we weren\u2019t close anymore. And I like how close we are anyway. Screw anyone who thinks differently. This whole thing was a stupid idea brought on by my reaction to\u2026.,\u201d Lucas trailed off. He remembered then that Lucille was still there. </p><p>Just because he was trying to be adult about the situation didn\u2019t make that reminder hurt any less. The boy began to stand up and back away from the hospital bed. </p><p>\u201cThe point is, I\u2019m moving back home. Anyway, your girlfriend is downstairs in the waiting room. I can send her in on my way out. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re tired, but\u2026\u201d </p><p>\u201cLucille\u2019s here? Why? And don\u2019t call her my girlfriend. You know we broke up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could\u2019ve gotten back together. I don\u2019t know.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI talked to her once after that party to tell her not to bother crawling back because we were done for good,\u201d Eliott declared with an insistent look in his eyes. Lucas had to admit that made him feel good. </p><p>\u201cSo, you don\u2019t want to see her?\u201d Lucas inquired, slightly hopeful. </p><p>\u201cFuck, no. She made both of us feel like shit. I\u2019m done with her. And I told you your moving out was a moronic idea. Glad we\u2019re finally on the same page. Also, don\u2019t leave,\u201d Eliott laughed. </p><p>Lucas couldn\u2019t stop his own grin from forming. He moved back towards the bed, but before he could return to his former spot, Eliott tugged on his sleeve to bring him closer to the top half of his reclined body. \u201cLay with me, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Eli. I\u2019ll hurt you! Your leg is all fractured and stuff,\u201d Lucas screeched as he playfully resisted Eliott\u2019s weak grip. </p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019ll lay on my right side. Trust me, there\u2019s enough room in this bed for both of us, tiny boy.\u201d</p><p>Lucas gave in pretty quickly after that. He made sure to be extremely careful as he got onto the bed, and he kept his right leg dangling off the side as his left side pressed against Eliott. It wasn\u2019t the most comfortable position, but it was exactly where Lucas wanted to be. </p><p>\u201cLu, I\u2019m not going to lie to you, I\u2019ll probably be asleep in the next 30 seconds,\u201d Eliott stated as he yawned and nuzzled into Lucas. </p><p>\u201cMe too, Eli. Worrying about you all day was tiring,\u201d Lucas responded. He knew it was probably a bad idea to fall asleep in Eliott\u2019s hospital bed, but he couldn\u2019t bring himself to care. </p>",
                "content": "<p>Another 5,550 words for you all. This chapter is pretty heavy, but it&rsquo;s important for the overall direction of the story, so bear with me. Also, Part 5 seems to be mysteriously gone from my blog, which completely sucks, so I had to repost it <a href=\"https://it-even-makes-me-rhyme.tumblr.com/post/185746472508/id-be-lost-and-lonely-if-not-for-you-part-5\">here</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Note: I know nothing about the medical field or surgery, so that part might be a little inaccurate. Lol sorry.<br /></p><p>Again, thank you all for being incredible, and enjoy&#10084;&#65039;</p><p>The outdoor dining area on campus was packed as lunchtime rolled around. Lucas was making his way through the crowd to where Yann had grabbed them a table when a girl ran by him, knocking her backpack directly into his shoulder. </p><p>Lucas grumbled but didn&rsquo;t have the energy to yell after her. Plus, he knew she was probably in a hurry and couldn&rsquo;t really fault her for that. He was always rushing through campus to get from class to class. Once he spotted Yann and Basile sitting at a table in the shade, he forgot about the girl and sat down with his friends. </p><p>&ldquo;I think we should start a band,&rdquo; Basile remarked as Lucas unwrapped his sandwich. Neither he nor Yann responded to Basile&rsquo;s outburst, both boys staring at their lunches to avoid their friend&rsquo;s gaze. That was usually how these things went, partially because no wanted to encourage Basile&rsquo;s dumb ideas and partially because it was funny. </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be a great way to meet girls and we&rsquo;ll get a ton of free alc-,&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Dude, something happened with Eliott,&rdquo; Lucas heard a voice he knew belonged to Arthur remark as footsteps approached their table.  </p><p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; Lucas inquired as he lifted his eyes to meet Arthur&rsquo;s. The look that they shared at that moment made the blue-eyed boy&rsquo;s heart drop to his stomach. </p><p>&ldquo;I was on my way here and I saw an ambulance leaving the art building. I stopped to find out what was going on and heard some guy saying &lsquo;the Demaury kid&rsquo; was in it,&rdquo; Arthur replied. </p><p>Lucas&rsquo; ears started ringing after &lsquo;ambulance,&rsquo; but he caught everything the other boy said. He quickly stood up and started backing away from his friends, but he paused when he realized he had no idea what his plan was. Lucas faintly registered Yann coming towards him and then felt a hand on his shoulder. </p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t touch me!&rdquo; Lucas sucked in a shaky breath and squeezed his eyes shut as Yann retreated. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry. I just&hellip; they&rsquo;re taking him to General, right? That&rsquo;s the closest hospital. I need to get there. What&rsquo;s the fastest way to get there?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll call a taxi,&rdquo; Basile quickly offered as he jogged away. &ldquo;Meet me in front of the sports complex,&rdquo; he yelled. </p><p>Arthur started gathering all of their backpacks as Yann cleared the food of the table. Lucas didn&rsquo;t move from where he had paused earlier. He&rsquo;d always been a worst case scenario type of thinker, and that wasn&rsquo;t helping him as his mind searched for a reason why Eliott would be in an ambulance. </p><p>Did someone hurt Eliott? What if Eliott hurt himself? Maybe it was a medical thing. Did he have an episode? </p><p>He didn&rsquo;t remember being guided to the taxi, or most of the short ride to the hospital. It was only when the vehicle stopped in front of the hospital that came back to reality. The gang, clearly trying not to overwhelm Lucas, tried to wait for the boy to make a move before they exited the taxi. After a minute or so, the taxi driver cleared his throat, signaling that he needed to pick up other passengers. That prompted Yann to open his door and let himself out, then jog over to the other side of the vehicle and open Lucas&rsquo; door. The shorted boy finally budged at that point and made his way towards the building. </p><p>The hospital was not as busy as Lucas expected it to be. Nurses, doctors, and orderlies were rushing around, trying to do their jobs, but there was no screaming, no blood smeared across the floor. He had guessed that TV dramas exaggerated that stuff, but at that moment he knew for sure.</p><p>Lucas realized then that Eliott could be anywhere in the hospital, depending on the condition he was in. The blue-eyed boy quickly looked towards Yann, silently begging him to figure out what they should do. </p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s head to the desk over there and see if they can give us any information,&rdquo; Yann suggested, pointing to a round counter  with doctors and nurses surrounding it. Lucas let the other boy lead the way as he slowly followed behind with Basile and Arthur. </p><p>&ldquo;Hi, we&rsquo;re hoping to find out where our friend, Eliott Demaury, is,&rdquo; Yann sweetly offered to one of the men sitting behind the counter. </p><p>The gentleman, clearly unimpressed by Yann&rsquo;s sunny demeanor, looked down at his tablet and started swiping slowly. Lucas wanted to grab him by the front of his scrubs and will him to move quicker, but he couldn&rsquo;t bring himself to move. </p><p>It all made his feel so useless. Ever since Arthur ran up to the table and told him what had happened, he&rsquo;d been unable to exert any energy beyond what was required to keep him alive. Eliott was his best friend, and yet Yann, Basile, and Arthur were the ones taking action to get them to him. </p><p>As he looked at the other three boys&rsquo; faces, he saw anxiousness, but he also saw determination. If they looked back at his, he was sure all they would see was terror. He was paralyzed by his own panic. The best person in his life could be gravely injured, and he wasn&rsquo;t doing anything to get to him. Eliott deserved better than what Lucas was giving him, but apprehension made it impossible for Lucas to offer that up. </p><p>The fact that the gang was there with him was probably the only reason he wasn&rsquo;t still sitting at that outdoor table on campus or in the backseat of the taxi. He bet he&rsquo;d feel incredibly lucky to have them at that moment if he wasn&rsquo;t incapable of any human emotion beyond fear. </p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s in surgery right now, guys, but that&rsquo;s all I can tell you,&rdquo; the man stated, bringing Lucas back to reality. &ldquo;I can only release information to family members.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Lucas is family!&rdquo; Basile shouted, looking to Lucas expectantly. </p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your relation to Mr. Demaury?&rdquo; The man, who Lucas now presumed was a nurse, questioned as he pursed his lips and raised his eyebrows. </p><p>&ldquo;I&hellip;ah&hellip;we&rsquo;re,&rdquo; but Lucas had no idea what to say. He stood there, stuttering and panicking as four sets of eyes focused on him.  </p><p>Eliott was his family; he&rsquo;d been sure of that for most of his life. But there was no word for what they were to each other. It never bothered Lucas before, but at that moment, it was the most frustrating truth in the world. He wanted to force himself to say &lsquo;cousin&rsquo; or &lsquo;stepbrother&rsquo; or anything that would get him more information, but he couldn&rsquo;t bring himself to do it. </p><p>Truthfully, he was scared to know more. If he lied his way into the family category, then he would have to find out Eliott&rsquo;s condition. He couldn&rsquo;t handle the possible implications of that decision. At that moment, he was in the state of ignorance, and it was slowly killing him, but he was still breathing, still functioning. Once he found out more, though, he might actually break down. If the news was bad, which was a real possibility, Lucas wouldn&rsquo;t be able to cope with that. He couldn&rsquo;t live his life without Eliott, that much he knew.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p><p>Looking back, he first had that realization when he was a teenager; right after Eliott started university, and he left Lucas alone at school to fend for himself.</p><p>(At least, that was how Lucas saw it at the time. Truthfully, he still had Imane and Yann to keep him company.) </p><p>Not having Eliott around was borderline unbearable. But he was incredibly happy for his best friend. No one deserved to finally head to university more than Eliott. </p><p>After failing to complete his bac the first time around, Eliott had to redo Terminale. When he broke the news to Lucas, (who already knew but wanted Eliott to be able to tell him for himself), he did it with a weak chuckle and a &ldquo;at least we&rsquo;ll be in school together for one more year.&rdquo; Lucas couldn&rsquo;t stop the tears from falling on his cheeks, though, because he knew. He knew how hard Eliott had worked throughout school and how passionate he was about studying art at university. And, because of his bipolar disorder, he wasn&rsquo;t going to be able to do that for another year. </p><p>Lucas felt like he should have done something. He should&rsquo;ve known that Eliott had stopped taking his meds and that he was entering a manic state. But he missed the signs. </p><p>Most of his time had been spent studying for his end-of-year tests and writing papers. He tried not to annoy Eliott, because he knew the boy was under a lot of pressure with his exams. Whenever he would check in with him through text, Eliott always told Lucas he was doing great and studying hard.</p><p>But what he was really doing was drawing. He had filled multiple notebooks with drawings of everything and everyone in his life. Some were colorful, others were black-and-white, and others were only half finished. The boy stayed up for days completing his project while he was meant to be preparing for his bac. Two days before exams began, Eliott went to one of the train stations by school and tried to paint a mural on the wall. He was picked up by the police and brought to the hospital, where he eventually entered a depressive state. </p><p>A few weeks later, when the dust settled and Eliott knew he was going to have to repeat the year, he and Lucas were sitting at the park, enjoying the cool weather when the younger boy asked the ever-present question. &ldquo;Why did you stop taking your meds?&rdquo;</p><p>Eliott sighed and started his response without looking at Lucas. &rdquo;I just wanted to be able to go to university like a regular student. And before you tell me I am a regular student, you know that I&rsquo;m not. But I felt like I could be. I started reading up on the different classes I&rsquo;d be able to take and looking into the on-campus apartments, and it all sounded so amazing. I&rsquo;d have to leave you, which sucked, but the university is only 20 minutes away from our neighborhood by bus, so I knew we&rsquo;d see each other all the time, and you would visit. Everything just felt like it was going great, so I stopped taking my meds because I didn&rsquo;t think I needed them.&rdquo;</p><p>Once Eliott finally looked at him, Lucas didn&rsquo;t know what to say. After a minute, something did come to mind, and he knew it had to be said. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to come back to school because of me. If you want to go somewhere else, be at a different school for your retake, I get that.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Lu, the fact that I have to do this, it&rsquo;s awful. But I know it&rsquo;d be ten times worse if I didn&rsquo;t have you there to eat lunch with, to sit with before school, and to take the bus with. That is what&rsquo;s making this whole ordeal so much more bearable.&rdquo; Lucas smiled at that because even thought he couldn&rsquo;t do anything for Eliott during his episode, he could do something now. He could be there for him that school year. </p><p>Eliott did pass his bac that year (with flying colors) and headed off to university. The day he moved out, he handed Lucas a very antiquated printout of directions from his house to Eliott&rsquo;s dorm building. The trip was 22 minutes total, which was a lot longer than the 6-minute walk between their two houses. And Lucas knew that there were a bunch of apps that could tell him the same information a lot quicker. But he loved that Eliott took the time to print the directions out, so he smiled brightly and hugged his best friend. </p><p>Lucas felt spoiled by the fact that he and Eliott had spent two years of lyc&eacute;e together instead of just one. Although the circumstances were terrible, he still had his best friend with him for an extra year. He&rsquo;d never been at that school sans Eliott, and on his first day without him, he felt completely lost. He rode the bus to school alone, sat at lunch with Yann picking at his food and not eating, and stood outside in the schoolyard at the end of the day, not wanting to make the trip home by himself. </p><p>Eliott called him that night, to ask how his first day of Terminale went, and Lucas held back his tears as he blatantly lied to Eliott about all the great things that he did to kick off his last year of lyc&eacute;e. Eliott could tell something was wrong, and asked Lucas multiple times to tell him what it was, but the shorted boy kept his mouth shut. There was no way he was going to drag Eliott down into his cave of self-pity. Once he hung up the phone, the tears freely flowed as he laid back and stared at his bedroom ceiling. </p><p>The realization that hit Lucas at that moment was jarring. Over the past two years, he and Eliott, who were already extremely close, had grown even closer. So close, in fact, that Lucas felt like part of him was missing the entire day he spent at school without his best friend. It was hard for Lucas to acknowledge how empty he felt without Eliott, because he knew he was only setting himself up for disappointment. </p><p>Lucas admittedly started spiraling from there. He concluded that one day, Eliott was going to find a serious girlfriend, get married, have kids, get a full-time job. Then, Lucas would probably never see him again. So really, this year was going to be good practice for his future without Eliott. </p><p>Future without Eliott? It wasn&rsquo;t like he was dying. Shit, Lucas didn&rsquo;t even want to think about Eliott dying, ever. He quickly pushed that thought aside. </p><p>It was pathetic, really, because Eliott was totally fine going off to university without Lucas. Sure, he said he missed him, but he called Lucas after his first day of classes and told him all about how awesome they were. And he called him the next day and told him how awesome those classes were as well. Then, he told Lucas during their Wednesday phone call that he wanted him to visit soon so he could show him all the cool coffee shops and bars he already found around campus.</p><p>Although Lucas was happy for his best friend, he was also kind of hurt that it seemed like Eliott was having such a great time without him. Wow, how fucked up is he? He&rsquo;s so fucking selfish. Lucas decided at that point that he wouldn&rsquo;t bother Eliott anymore. He didn&rsquo;t want to burden the other boy with his overdramatic teenage angst. </p><p>Right after he finished that thought, his phone started ringing. When he checked the screen, he saw that it was Eliott again. He contemplated not answering, because he knew he was still sniffling and hoarse, but Eliott would probably just call again. &ldquo;Hey, Eli! Calling again so soon?&rdquo; He tried to sound as cheery as possible. </p><p>&ldquo;I miss you, Lu. Like, really miss you. And I know I&rsquo;ve only been gone like a week and I know I&rsquo;m only 20 minutes away, but I miss you,&rdquo; Eliott blurted out. </p><p>All of the breath was knocked out of Lucas&rsquo; body as he listened to Eliott&rsquo;s words, so it took him a few seconds to whisper back, &ldquo;I miss you too, you nerd.&rdquo;</p><p>Eliott loudly chuckled at that. &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you tell me sooner? I&rsquo;ve been missing you since I left, but I didn&rsquo;t want to say anything because I&rsquo;m supposed to be the cool university student.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Every time we talk, you tell me about how much you love school and how much fun you&rsquo;re having. I didn&rsquo;t want to bring you down with my sadness, but school really sucks without you,&rdquo; Lucas admitted. </p><p>&ldquo;I am enjoying school, and I&rsquo;ve met some cool people, but I really wish you were here. I mean, you had to know. I&rsquo;ve called you every single day since I left, and I practically begged you to visit me this weekend,&rdquo; Eliott huffed out. Oh, so that&rsquo;s why he kept mentioning the bars and coffee shops. </p><p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll be there. Because I really miss you, too, in case I haven&rsquo;t said that enough yet,&rdquo; Lucas smiled for the first time in days. </p><p>Yeah, he knew it was cliche, but he needed Eliott around almost as much as he needed air. Or water. Or anything else that makes it possible for a human being to live.   </p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Lucas! Sweetie, you&rsquo;re here,&rdquo; he was snapped back to reality by small hands wrapped around his upper back and the light press of lips on his cheek. He realized that while he was deep in thought, someone has steered him away from the desk and brought him to the waiting room. Yann, Basile, and Arthur were sitting in the uncomfortable plastic chairs, but he was still standing. </p><p>He also realized that Eloise was the one who greeted him a few seconds ago. She was standing in front of him with tear-stained cheeks and watery eyes. Lucas could tell she left work in a hurry because all she had in her hands were her car keys. &ldquo;I tried to call you. So did your mom,&rdquo; Eloise explained. Lucas realized he hadn&rsquo;t even thought about his phone since they left campus. He hoped it was someone, probably in his backpack. He wanted to ask Yann about it, just so Eloise would stop looking at him with those worried eyes that made him want to sink into the ground, but he thought that&rsquo;d be inappropriate, so he stopped himself before the words left his mouth. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; Lucas forced himself to say.</p><p>&ldquo;Sorry for what, Lucas?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not really sure,&rdquo; he confessed. &ldquo;They wouldn&rsquo;t tell me anything when I arrived. I&rsquo;m not family.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re my family, honey. And Eliott&rsquo;s. These people may not know that, but I do,&rdquo; she rubbed her thumb over his cheekbone. </p><p>It was sick, really, Lucas thought as he looked at the woman who was like a second mother to him. Her son was in the hospital and yet she was comforting Lucas. </p><p>He looked to his left when he heard the waiting room doors sliding open and saw Lucille entering with one of her friends. She was also tearing up as she took in her surroundings, clearly flustered. Could everyone feel emotion but him? </p><p>He pushed aside that thought as Lucille met his gaze. They stared at each other for a second, blank expressions on both their faces, before she looked away, turning to the girl with her. </p><p>Lucas turned back to face Eloise. As much as he didn&rsquo;t want to ask, he knew that he had to. That&rsquo;s what you did in those situations. You found out whether or not the person you loved was gravely injured. </p><p>However, before he could speak, Lucille approached them with an anxious expression on her face. &ldquo;Mrs. Demaury, how is he? What happened to him?&rdquo;</p><p>At that, the three guys stood up and crowded around Lucas. The action, although it came from a place of love, made him feel like he was suffocating. </p><p>Eloise took a long breath before she directed her words at Lucas, much to Lucille&rsquo;s annoyance. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s in surgery right now. One of the bookshelves in the art studio gave out while he was working and it fell on his leg. It crushed some of his bones and ligaments. It&rsquo;s a severe fracture, but they don&rsquo;t know the full extent of the damage yet.&rdquo; </p><p>A feeling of relief washed over Lucas&rsquo; body. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s good,&rdquo; he declared before he had the chance to think about it. &ldquo;I mean, not good but&hellip;better than&hellip;other&hellip;things.&rdquo; He heard Lucille scoff at his stuttering, so he shut his mouth before he had the chance to make any more idiotic statements. </p><p>Eloise offered him a small smile. &ldquo;Yes Lucas, you&rsquo;re right. It definitely is.&rdquo; </p><p>After that, it was a waiting game. Lucas&rsquo; mom and Nana Mary arrived a half-hour after Eloise, and Andrew appeared an hour after that. When his mom sat down next to him, Lucas burrowed himself into her side, looking for the feeling of security the action provided him with when he was a child. </p><p>A doctor came out to give them an update at some point. She explained that there was a lot of damage to Eliott&rsquo;s left tibia, but thankfully they hadn&rsquo;t run into any complications with the initial repair. When Lucas heard that the surgery would take at least another hour, he almost groaned. He couldn&rsquo;t keep waiting around like that. It made him feel small and helpless. </p><p>The gang was still there, so Lucas told them to head home. They protested adamantly, but begrudgingly left when he promised to send them constant updates. </p><p>The next two hours passed slowly, excruciatingly so, but the same doctor as before came out and told them that Eliott had been moved to recovery. He was slightly groggy, but he was allowed to have two visitors at a time. Eloise and Andrew quickly followed the doctor toward another wing of the hospital. Lucas wanted to go as well, but he knew Eliott&rsquo;s parents deserved to see their son first, so he kept quiet. After all, he&rsquo;d been waiting for hours. He could handle 20 more minutes. </p><p>After a little while, Eloise came back to the waiting room and walked up to where Lucas and his mom were sitting. &ldquo;Lucas, he&rsquo;s still a little dazed, but he&rsquo;d like to see you if you&rsquo;re up for it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; Lucas shot out of his chair and started moving towards the direction he watched Eloise come from only seconds earlier.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to see him,&rdquo; he heard from behind him. He stopped and turned to see Lucille scurrying after them. In all his worry, he&rsquo;d forgotten she was even there. Honestly, he wished he could again. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Lucille, but we don&rsquo;t want to overwhelm him right after surgery. Maybe you should head home. They&rsquo;re keeping him here overnight so you can come back tomorrow and see him,&rdquo; Eloise offered politely. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m his girlfriend. There&rsquo;s no way I&rsquo;m leaving. I know he wants to see me,&rdquo; Lucille shot back, ignoring the older woman&rsquo;s suggestion.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, he specifically asked to see Lucas, so that&rsquo;s who I&rsquo;m taking to see him. After that, I don&rsquo;t know if he&rsquo;ll be up for any more visitors, but you&rsquo;re welcome to sit in the waiting room.&rdquo; At that, Eloise put her arm around Lucas&rsquo; shoulder and guided him away. She stopped them in front of an elevator and pressed the &ldquo;Up&rdquo; button. They waited in silence until the elevator arrived. After everyone cleared out of it, they stepped in and Eloise press the button marked &ldquo;four.&rdquo;</p><p>She was the one who broke the silence. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry but that girl is too much. And I know she and my son broke up, so she should probably stop calling herself &lsquo;his girlfriend&rsquo; now.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, she&rsquo;s doesn&rsquo;t like me,&rdquo; Lucas admitted as they exited the elevator and quickly turned a corner, coming upon a hallway marked &ldquo;Recovery.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t imagine why,&rdquo; Eloise smirked. Before Lucas could question her, she remarked &ldquo;421, here we are&rdquo; and pushed a slightly ajar wooden door further open. Lucas slowly followed her in until he was staring at his best friend, who was sitting in a hospital bed with his eyes half-open. His face was turned away from Lucas as he stared out the window, so he didn&rsquo;t notice the younger boy&rsquo;s entrance. </p><p>Eloise quickly remedied that. &ldquo;Eli, look who&rsquo;s here to see you.&rdquo;</p><p>Eliott rotated his who body to look towards where his mother&rsquo;s voice came from. He and Lucas quickly locked eyes, and a closed lip smile appeared on both their faces. &ldquo;Hi, Lu,&rdquo; Eliott whispered. </p><p>&ldquo;Hi, Eli,&rdquo; Lucas whispered back. </p><p>Andrew chose that moment to clear his throat, and Lucas was thankful because he&rsquo;d forgotten the older man was even there. He was sitting in a large recliner in the corner of the room, staring out the window as Eliott had been doing earlier. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to check in with the doctors and ask them about the next steps of your recovery, Eliott.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll walk out with you. I want to go back down to the waiting room and tell Mary and Isabelle to head home. They&rsquo;re probably exhausted and I&rsquo;m sure Lucas will be here for a little while. One of us can bring Lucas home later,&rdquo; Eloise proclaimed. </p><p>Lucas wasn&rsquo;t sure if they knew he wasn&rsquo;t staying at the apartment. If not, that&rsquo;d probably be an awkward conversation later. </p><p>Both parents left, and all that remained was Eliott and Lucas, staring at each other across a hospital room. Lucas realized at that moment that he was standing as far away from Eliott as the room allowed, so he took a few steps towards his bed. He stopped himself at what he felt was a respectable distance, afraid to overwhelm the other boy. </p><p>Truthfully, he had no idea what he could say to Eliott that wouldn&rsquo;t reveal the fact that he hadn&rsquo;t been able to form a coherent sentence in the past few hours. There was no reason for Eliott to know how scared Lucas was; it wouldn&rsquo;t help his recovery. </p><p>The boy in the hospital bed winced as he shifted to sit up higher. &ldquo;Good thing I&rsquo;m an artist and not an up-and-coming football star because this would definitely be career-ending,&rdquo; he laughed weakly. </p><p>Lucas wanted to laugh with him, really, he did. But he couldn&rsquo;t. His body wouldn&rsquo;t allow him to feel any joy. It wouldn&rsquo;t let him feel much of anything but worry and panic. So he just stood there, nodding at Eliott with a blank expression on his face. </p><p>&ldquo;Lucas, what&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; Eliott said seriously. And Lucas scoffed at that because seriously? </p><p>&ldquo;Are you really asking me that right now? As you sit in a hospital bed with those&hellip;things sticking out of your leg?&rdquo;</p><p>Eliott frowned at that. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine. It doesn&rsquo;t even hurt that much, rea-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not fine!&rdquo; Lucas cut him off. Every emotion he&rsquo;d been unable to feel earlier was now fighting to be released from the pent-up confines of his mind and body. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re hurting. They had to preform major surgery on your leg. You&rsquo;ll need months of physical therapy!&rdquo; Lucas felt his chest constrict as a sob escaped his mouth. Of course now is the time I finally cry. He looked down at the scuffed tiles of the room and thought about how much he both never wanted to leave and didn&rsquo;t want to be there anymore. </p><p>The younger boy looked back up at his best friend and saw that he was also tearing up. It made him feel like an asshole. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry. I didn&rsquo;t mean to upset you with my yelling. I&rsquo;m just scared.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Come here,&rdquo; Eliott beckoned Lucas closer to the bed and the younger boy sheepishly complied. Once he was within reach, Eliott took him by the wrist and guided his hand towards the older boy&rsquo;s cheek. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m here. I&rsquo;m alright.&rdquo; </p><p>Lucas instantly relaxed. It was magical, the way Eliott could do that. </p><p>&ldquo;I know that now. But the past few hours have been the worst of my life. You&rsquo;re my best friend, and we&rsquo;ve barely talked in the last week and a half. What if something had happened to you? I wouldn&rsquo;t have been able to live with myself.&rdquo; </p><p>Eliott didn&rsquo;t respond to Lucas&rsquo; question, but he kept his hand lightly gripped around Lucas&rsquo; wrist as a sign that the younger boy shouldn&rsquo;t remove his hand from its position on Eliott&rsquo;s cheek. He was so breathtaking, even sitting in a hospital bed in an unflattering patient gown with tears running down his face. </p><p>Lucas realized that there was no chance he was going to be able to stay away from Eliott any longer. After the events of the day, he wanted to be around him as much as possible; his stubbornness and pining needed to be put aside. </p><p>His feelings for the other boy hadn&rsquo;t subsided, and they clearly weren&rsquo;t going to any time soon. Now, more than ever, he knew that he loved Eliott in a hundred different ways. That probably should have frightened him, but it didn&rsquo;t. If anything, it actually excited him to feel something that strongly, especially for his Eliott. </p><p>The way that Eliott loved him back, platonically, had to be enough for him. Eliott needed him to be strong while he healed. If he truly loved the older boy as much as he told himself he did, he&rsquo;d put Eliott&rsquo;s recovery before his own feelings.  </p><p>Lucas gently removed his hand from Eliott&rsquo;s face. The older boy went to protest, but stopped when he saw Lucas moving to lean on the side of his hospital bed. He shifted his good leg so Lucas could sit, and the shorter boy rested with one food tucked under him and the other planted on the ground. &ldquo;I know you&rsquo;ll be staying with your parents for a little while, but I&rsquo;m coming home. I&rsquo;ll stay at Yann&rsquo;s tonight, because some of my stuff is there, but I&rsquo;ll be back at our apartment tomorrow.&rdquo; </p><p>Again, the older boy was silent for a couple of seconds, but Lucas knew what he was going to say. &ldquo;That makes me really happy, but I don&rsquo;t want this whole thing to make you feel like you have to come home,&rdquo; Eliott stated seriously. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re still not ready, I&rsquo;d rather you just stay with Yann until you know you&rsquo;ll come back for good.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m ready,&rdquo; Lucas reassured him.  &ldquo;Being away from you didn&rsquo;t suddenly make me feel like we weren&rsquo;t close anymore. And I like how close we are anyway. Screw anyone who thinks differently. This whole thing was a stupid idea brought on by my reaction to&hellip;.,&rdquo; Lucas trailed off. He remembered then that Lucille was still there. </p><p>Just because he was trying to be adult about the situation didn&rsquo;t make that reminder hurt any less. The boy began to stand up and back away from the hospital bed. </p><p>&ldquo;The point is, I&rsquo;m moving back home. Anyway, your girlfriend is downstairs in the waiting room. I can send her in on my way out. I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re tired, but&hellip;&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Lucille&rsquo;s here? Why? And don&rsquo;t call her my girlfriend. You know we broke up.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You could&rsquo;ve gotten back together. I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I talked to her once after that party to tell her not to bother crawling back because we were done for good,&rdquo; Eliott declared with an insistent look in his eyes. Lucas had to admit that made him feel good. </p><p>&ldquo;So, you don&rsquo;t want to see her?&rdquo; Lucas inquired, slightly hopeful. </p><p>&ldquo;Fuck, no. She made both of us feel like shit. I&rsquo;m done with her. And I told you your moving out was a moronic idea. Glad we&rsquo;re finally on the same page. Also, don&rsquo;t leave,&rdquo; Eliott laughed. </p><p>Lucas couldn&rsquo;t stop his own grin from forming. He moved back towards the bed, but before he could return to his former spot, Eliott tugged on his sleeve to bring him closer to the top half of his reclined body. &ldquo;Lay with me, please.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, Eli. I&rsquo;ll hurt you! Your leg is all fractured and stuff,&rdquo; Lucas screeched as he playfully resisted Eliott&rsquo;s weak grip. </p><p>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;ll lay on my right side. Trust me, there&rsquo;s enough room in this bed for both of us, tiny boy.&rdquo;</p><p>Lucas gave in pretty quickly after that. He made sure to be extremely careful as he got onto the bed, and he kept his right leg dangling off the side as his left side pressed against Eliott. It wasn&rsquo;t the most comfortable position, but it was exactly where Lucas wanted to be. </p><p>&ldquo;Lu, I&rsquo;m not going to lie to you, I&rsquo;ll probably be asleep in the next 30 seconds,&rdquo; Eliott stated as he yawned and nuzzled into Lucas. </p><p>&ldquo;Me too, Eli. Worrying about you all day was tiring,&rdquo; Lucas responded. He knew it was probably a bad idea to fall asleep in Eliott&rsquo;s hospital bed, but he couldn&rsquo;t bring himself to care. </p>",

        "answer": "<p>I loved this question!!! Thank you!</p><p><b>Druck: </b>As much as Jonas is my favourite character I think I\u2019d rather <b>David</b> get a season here. We still don\u2019t know a lot about him. We don\u2019t know his backstory or all the struggles he had to deal with or his family situation. I would love to explore all that through his eyes. Also I want to see his journey of becoming a film maker!! We could obvs see Davenzi too and maybe we could explore Matteo\u2019s mental health through his season. And I want to see where he fits with the boys and the crew because he clearly seems like he is a good friend to them.</p><p><b>Italia: </b>Well I\u2019m literally writing my own <a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/19006075/chapters/45134452\" target=\"_blank\"><i>Giovanni Season</i></a> as a fanfic so my answer is clear: it\u2019s <b>Giovanni. </b>I just love him so much. The love he has for the boys, especially Marti is so amazing. I would love for his \u201cmom friend\u201d role to be explored more and his protective side too. Also his dynamic with Elia two of them being the parents. And how he takes care of everyone (<strike>but nobody takes care of him)</strike>. We could also see more of his political sides and his relationship with his parents. Him and Eva could come full circle too.</p><p><b>France</b>: I only liked the idea of Arthur because it meant that they could do a completely original season because we know nothing about him. But honestly I\u2019d prefer a <b>Daphne</b> one. They kinda messed her in s4 but in s3 she was just so lovely and I loved her whole excitement for the recreational room. I wonder a lot about her family life because she clearly struggles and her eating disorder is something to be explored still. And I want to see more of her relationship with Basile too.\u00a0</p><p><b>NL: </b>This is gonna go to another Vilde remake which is <b>Engel. </b>You can blame the countless lesbian Engel headcanons I have read. Honestly, the Skam universe lacks so much in lesbian characters and Engel could be the perfect represantation. She is just so soft and kind and she is more wise then she seems so. Her dynamic with Liv this season was everything. I want that explored more. Honestly I need more of the girl squad. </p><p><b>Wtfock:</b> I\u2019m fairly new to this fandom and I\u2019m gonna go with a bold choice that is <b>Luca</b>. She is one of my fave Chris\u2019s and I think a Chris character definetly needs their own season. I felt so bad after seeing how sad she was over being kept out of the loop with Zoe and Senne. Her season could explore how she feels left out in the friend group and being proven the other with the girls supporting her. </p><p>Anyway thanks again for this question anon!!! I would love to know what you think too!</p><p><b>send me skam + remakes asks!</b></p>",
