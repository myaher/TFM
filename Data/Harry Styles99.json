She was hungry, lack of work had denied her the opportunity to feed for a poor amount of time and it was making her weak and restless. That paired with the swarms of people around could only be a recipe for disaster.</p><p>\u201cI know, I know! But you gave me an idea the other day when you were saying how good you\u2019d felt after helping that girl away from&hellip; you know.\u201d Penny trailed off at the end of her sentence, too afraid to speak the words aloud.</p><p>Two hundred years <i>had</i> thankfully prepared YN for the moment almost a month ago when she witnessed a poor girl about to be violently attacked. It was horrible at first, feeling both the victim\u2019s and the attacker\u2019s emotions so close to her, but once she\u2019d tore the sick bastard from the quivering girl\u2019s frame and drained the life from him in the large and vacant woodland she frequented to feed, she\u2019d actually felt good about herself for once.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d Penny had skipped the line and was now stood grinning in front of a large security guard, \u201cwe have an appointment with, er&hellip; Jeff. Azoff.\u201d</p><p>The bouncer raised his brows at Penny as if to say \u2018really?\u2019, but never actually said anything to her, he just stood watching her, silently telling her \u2018nice try\u2019.</p><p>Penny panicked internally, shuffling around herself to get YN\u2019s attention, who was too busy staring at the homeless person across the street. <i>Was it acceptable to end his life? He had nothing and no one&hellip; no one would miss him.</i></p><p>\u201cYN!\u201d Penny hissed, smacking the top of her arm a couple of times. \u201cTake your sunnies off for God\u2019s sake.\u201d</p><p><i>Get out of your arse, YN! You can\u2019t murder a helpless innocent!</i> Reluctantly peeling the dark shades from her face, she shoved them into her bag and smiled awkwardly at the the towering guard.</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d the guard was suddenly wide eyed and shifting awkwardly, \u201cyou\u2019re the vamp they\u2019re interviewing?\u201d</p><p>YN cringed at his choice of words and sighed with irritation. \u201cYes, I\u2019m the vampire they\u2019re interviewing.\u201d She answered bluntly.</p><p>\u00ac</p><p>\u201cWell, Mrs YLN,\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Miss.\u201d YN answered shortly, forgetting herself and who she was talking with. \u201cSorry, er, I\u2019m just Miss. I\u2019m not married.\u201d</p><p>Mr Azoff smiled at her sweetly, already forgiving her cold interruption without a second thought on it. \u201cMy apologies, Miss YLN, I don\u2019t know how much your friend has told you but we\u2019d really appreciate your help this evening.\u201d</p><p>She wriggled uncomfortably for a short moment. YN had no idea what she was here for, Penny had said nothing, and Mr Azoff had only asked normal interviewing questions and vaguely touched on her abilities. \u201cWhat would I be doing..?\u201d</p><p>Once again Mr Azoff appeared to ignore her irritated and bored composure and smiled brilliantly at her. \u201cIf you hadn\u2019t already noticed my client is holding a show here tonight, and unfortunately with the amount of younger girls here the number of&hellip;\u201d He struggled for the right word, \u201charassments that occur has been quite frightening. I understand you haven\u2019t fed for a while and this could be difficult for you, but my client and I\u2019s number one priority is to keep the audience safe. I can\u2019t imagine a better way to do that than with you.\u201d</p><p>The idea was intriguing, for sure. YN had never been one of those vampires who just drank from whoever. Humans deserved as much respect as vampires did, and though humans were certainly larger in numbers (there were only around ten thousand vampires in existence at any one time) it didn\u2019t mean they were disposable. So YN had adopted a system very early on in her life whereby she would only feed from someone who was already dying or could be deemed not worthy of living (like abusers and murderers). Because of her favour for human life she was an outcast within her community, and very few vampires respected they way she lived out her existence. Some had adopted the same habits, though they were often hard to find. To be able to work helping those humans, and possibly feeding at the same time was a win-win, surely?</p><p>\u201cI guess it can\u2019t hurt for one evening.\u201d She agreed, finally smiling at Mr Azoff.</p><p>He beamed at her, standing promptly from his seat in the large arena. \u201cExcellent!\u201d He extended a hand out towards YN, who took it once she stood to give him a gentle shake. \u201cLet me introduce you to a few people, and then we can get you out where we need you.\u201d</p><p>\u00ac</p><p>\u201cWhere is Jeffrey?\u201d Harry grumbled as he dressed himself for the evening in his next outlandish suit.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s recreating Tom Cruise\u2019s ninety four classic.\u201d Mitch snorted at his own joke, assessing his fresh trim in the mirror.</p><p>Harry turned to Mitch with a raised brow. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s in the arena doing an interview. We heard she\u2019s a vamp.\u201d Sarah clarified for him.</p><p>\u201cWhat do we need one of those for?\u201d He frowned, the idea of having one in amongst his fans terrifying him somewhat.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s that one that famously started the \u2018feeding only when they\u2019re cunts\u2019 lifestyle.\u201d Mitch said casually, as if he hadn\u2019t just dropped the \u2018c\u2019 word mid sentence.</p><p>Sarah frowned at Mitch for his choice of word but neglected to mention her disapproval. \u201cYou know the one, can\u2019t remember her name but she\u2019s pretty cool. Loads of vampy talents, loves us hoomans. Saw her in the hall with Jeff earlier and she was super beautiful, not in a way you\u2019d expect though.\u201d</p><p>Harry pursed his lips in thought, shaking his head. \u201cNo, doesn\u2019t ring a bell.\u201d</p><p>\u00ac</p><p>Mr Azoff had introduced YN to a flurry of crew members working on the show that night, mostly those of importance and who she might need to go to for any assistance, though it was incredibly unlikely that would happen.</p><p>\u201cI just need to go and do something real quick.\u201d Mr Azoff gushed as they stopped outside a dressing room door. \u201cWait right here.\u201d</p><p>YN stood awkwardly in the hallway as she waited for Mr Azoff to do his errand, admiring the plethora of artists that littered the walls. She rarely visited events like this, mostly to avoid temptation from the mass amounts of humans, though she often occupied her free time watching old concert performances on Sky Arts just out of curiosity. She didn\u2019t deny that she could probably handle herself if she really had to, but even still, some humans had such a strong and desirable scent it was too much to worth the risk. Any other vampire would just do it.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d A gloriously deep tone hummed at her from down the hall, the vibrations of the voice echoing off the walls like an excited bouncy ball.</p><p>It was instinctive of her to snap her attention to whoever it was without thought, and her heart skipped for the sight in front of her. She recognised him, only for the fact that Penny had his album playing on repeat at all hours of the day, along with any of his previous work. She\u2019d always found him attractive, even for a human, but stood in front of him now, actually in the flesh, he was only what YN could describe as God-like, and definitely worthy. A vampire lifestyle would have suited him so well, there was no doubt about that.</p><p>Harry felt her eyes piercing into his, and they were an incredible sight to behold. Impossibly they were an even darker and more striking green than his own, closer to a rich mossy colour, her pupils dilated so much that their colour was only a thin ring bordering them. Sarah had been right, she was beautiful in a peculiar way, almost as if she was accidentally born of her nature. Yet it still fit her perfectly, as she stood in front of him with a bizarre and unfitting coyness, pulling her sleeve over her hand in an almost uncomfortable and awkward manner.</p><p>Little did Harry know that his scent had YN\u2019s mouth watering instantly, the thumbnail that instinctively sharpened to a point when she grew ravenous threatening to rip through the fabric of her jumper\u2019s cuff, and she was really, really struggling to hold back her natural tendencies. She swallowed the saliva that threatened in her mouth, taking a deep breath to at least attempt to calm the burning desire in her throat.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m, um, just waiting for Mr Azoff.\u201d Her voice was quiet, but still an absolutely lovely sound to listen to. <i>But that\u2019s the way she was meant to be.</i> It\u2019s what they were designed for, to be completely desirable and seductive, even when they weren\u2019t really trying.</p><p>Harry nodded once as he understood that it was definitely her that Jeff had been interviewing. \u201cI see, you\u2019re the vamp he\u2019s hiring?\u201d</p><p>Again with the abbreviation of her kind, she hated how the modern world often ruined such sacred pieces of history. \u201cThat would be me, yes. Just for this evening, anyway.\u201d YN offered a tight smile, averting her gaze from his and back to the frames on the wall.</p><p>\u201cHarold!\u201d Jeff\u2019s booming voice came from behind them. \u201cGood, you\u2019ve already met.\u201d He slapped a hand to Harry\u2019s back and grinned. \u201cYN is helping tonight to&hellip; warden the crowds.\u201d</p><p>Harry nodded. \u201cSo I\u2019ve heard.\u201d His tone was light, though the surly female standing with them admittedly dampened his mood slightly, even if she was a sight to look at.</p><p>YN turned back to Mr Azoff with a small smile, not wanting to appear rude to her temporary employer.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get you settled!\u201d Jeff said with a loud clap of his hands, causing Harry to jump a little as YN barely winced.</p><p>\u00ac</p><p>As the Apollo filled with people YN wandered around through the aisles, ignoring the occasional gawks she received. She attempted to concentrate more on the emotions of the people entering, focussing mostly on those of distress or&hellip; arousal. It grew more difficult as the room became full of gushing fans, some of whom really did smell good, though nowhere near as good as Harry had earlier.</p><p>The show started, and YN became overwhelmed with the fans excitement through the room, making it extremely difficult to focus on much more than the burning in her throat. She continued to move around, catching sight of Harry\u2019s daft antics on stage every now and then and smiling to herself. She was well aware that the marks on her neck and face were probably visible, and was no doubt the reason so many people were staring at her, so to avoid looking like a complete misery she offered each gawker a smile, all of whom suddenly smiled back.</p><p>For a while it all seemed pretty quiet, but then she felt it.</p><p>YN felt that gut wrenching, heart aching feeling of a young girl in distress, coupled with another\u2019s aggression, and she knew this was why she was here. She followed her internal map to the couple caught up in a scurry in the middle of a crowded and utterly packed show. She shoved through the audience, trying to be as polite but as urgent as possible as she squeezed through the crammed floor. There he was, tall and broad, his hands running along this tiny framed girl\u2019s hips and waist as she very obviously tried to wriggle away from him.</p><p>YN braced herself for what she was about to do, ignoring the fact that everyone within a three metre radius had now focussed their attention from Harry\u2019s performance to the horrible scene in front of them.</p><p>Harry had noticed it, noticed the absence of attention after only a few seconds, and he could see one of his fans struggling. YN was right there, and boy was she a confusing sight, one that was simultaneously nightmarish and seductive all at the same time. It was right there and then that Harry knew she\u2019d got it under control, and that it was in everyone\u2019s best interest to carry on as if nothing was happening.</p><p>Running a hand along his back, YN felt the man\u2019s frame stiffen at her delicate touch as she silkily slid between him and the distressed fan. Paying little attention to the girl for the moment, YN forced her gaze into the eyes of her new prey, who had lost all self consciousness and was now completely hers to deal with. She smiled up at him, her eyes full of deceiving warmth as she continued to stroke his chest with one hand. He would be a good feed, his size no doubt enough to keep her going for a few weeks.</p><p>Before YN could finish the deed she turned herself and her prey so that she was facing the stage and the petrified fan. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d The fan nodded furiously, though her tears might suggest otherwise, and YN felt sick for her. Gazing back to the attacker she wrapped her free hand around his throat, her thumbnail grazing the pulsing flesh of the vein on his neck. She met Harry\u2019s eye line momentarily, before closing her eyes and willing her presence into the woodland to dispose of her human conquest.</p><p>The crowd around her gasped as her body vanished with that of the horrible man, and Harry struggled to keep his composure. Why did he insist on watching her when he knew what the outcome would be? Now he felt ill. She probably wouldn\u2019t even come back, vampires were known to be selfish that way.</p><p>The second YN felt the mossy, bark floor beneath her she twisted her prey\u2019s neck, ending his despicable existence. Her nail pierced the soft flesh on his neck, a small bead of thick, crimson blood releasing from the cut. Pressing her lips to the vein her natural instinct took over as she drained the blood from his limp body, finally subsiding the painful flame that had resided in her throat for almost a week. Small and frustrated whimpers escaped her as she drank, the blood not tasting anywhere near as good as she\u2019d hoped. It was dirty, probably ruined from medication or nasty habits, but at least she was fed, and she didn\u2019t have to focus on feeding for a while.</p><p>Hurling the dead man\u2019s body into the small lake with a heavy stone attached to his middle, she watched the little bubbles rise to the surface until they completely stopped and she was satisfied he would never be discovered. It was a horrible way to send someone out of this life and into the next, but he was a terrible man, and she didn\u2019t feel even a little guilty knowing that his body would lie on the cold floor of the lake\u2019s surface, along with all the other bastards she\u2019d drained.</p><p>There was a small waterfall nearby that she would always wash in after a big feed, just to be sure she didn\u2019t return to wherever she came from in a terrifying mess. The cold water never bothered her, she just enjoyed the naturalness of being with the earth as she cleansed herself, both in body and mind. There was something about this place she\u2019d discovered so many years ago, it was like a little capsule of another world. No one ever ventured here besides her, and she was convinced that no one else knew it existed.</p><p>When YN found herself back at the arena she was sad to see the show had ended. She frantically searched for the fan she\u2019d helped, feeling a little deflated when she was nowhere to be seen.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s backstage.\u201d Mr Azoff\u2019s voice carried through the emptying room.</p><p>YN whirled to see him waiting by the fence. \u201cShe is?\u201d</p><p>Mr Azoff nodded with a small smirk. \u201cHarry asked to have her and her friend brought backstage after you disappeared. I don\u2019t think he thought you\u2019d come back.\u201d</p><p>She frowned at him him, disappointed that he\u2019d apparently created such a poor impression of her so soon. \u201cOh&hellip;\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re more than welcome to prove him wrong.\u201d Mr Azoff raised his brows at her with a mischievous grin.</p><p>YN couldn\u2019t help the matching expression she gave him, and followed after him through to the halls she\u2019d been lurking in beforehand. The girl was with Harry, who was keeping a comfortable distance whilst assuring her that he doesn\u2019t intend for anything like that to happen during his performances. She was still evidently upset, her hands shaking as she thanked him for being so wonderful.</p><p>\u201cHope you don\u2019t mind us interrupting,\u201d Jeff knocked lightly on the open door, \u201csomeone came back to check on you.\u201d</p><p>YN peeked in from behind Jeff with a sweet smile. \u201cHi.\u201d</p><p>Harry couldn\u2019t help but notice her eyes again, and the fact that they were now a whole new shade of beautiful butterscotch, no doubt from her unspoken feed. Her hair was damp, no longer in the little bun it had been in earlier as it fell around her shoulders. Had she really had time to shower? He also noticed that she seemed much more relaxed, even as she walked into the room to embrace the grateful girl, she didn\u2019t seem so uptight. So that was it, she really was just hungry earlier. </p><p>He was glad that she had come back, it meant she really was different to all the other vamps out there who treated humans like shit on their shoes. Whoever YN was, she was lovely, and she was special.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"376\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"stylesinthewild:LOn-DkE_VAFK70lpIK4nFQ:Z-899i2Tn6uej\"><img alt=\"image\" src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/59d5076871a36e1bbfc54b092bbc4066/tumblr_p25n2iUONi1v6scw1o1_500.gif\" data-orig-height=\"376\" data-orig-width=\"500\"/></figure><p><b>~<a href=\"http://waitingfortwilight.tumblr.com/post/182788617844/blood-like-wine-part-ii\">Part II</a>~</b></p><p>Thank you babies! &lt;3</p>",

She was hungry, lack of work had denied her the opportunity to feed for a poor amount of time and it was making her weak and restless. That paired with the swarms of people around could only be a recipe for disaster.</p><p>\u201cI know, I know! But you gave me an idea the other day when you were saying how good you\u2019d felt after helping that girl away from\u2026 you know.\u201d Penny trailed off at the end of her sentence, too afraid to speak the words aloud.</p><p>Two hundred years <i>had</i> thankfully prepared YN for the moment almost a month ago when she witnessed a poor girl about to be violently attacked. It was horrible at first, feeling both the victim\u2019s and the attacker\u2019s emotions so close to her, but once she\u2019d tore the sick bastard from the quivering girl\u2019s frame and drained the life from him in the large and vacant woodland she frequented to feed, she\u2019d actually felt good about herself for once.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d Penny had skipped the line and was now stood grinning in front of a large security guard, \u201cwe have an appointment with, er\u2026 Jeff. Azoff.\u201d</p><p>The bouncer raised his brows at Penny as if to say \u2018really?\u2019, but never actually said anything to her, he just stood watching her, silently telling her \u2018nice try\u2019.</p><p>Penny panicked internally, shuffling around herself to get YN\u2019s attention, who was too busy staring at the homeless person across the street. <i>Was it acceptable to end his life? He had nothing and no one\u2026 no one would miss him.</i></p><p>\u201cYN!\u201d Penny hissed, smacking the top of her arm a couple of times. \u201cTake your sunnies off for God\u2019s sake.\u201d</p><p><i>Get out of your arse, YN! You can\u2019t murder a helpless innocent!</i> Reluctantly peeling the dark shades from her face, she shoved them into her bag and smiled awkwardly at the the towering guard.</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d the guard was suddenly wide eyed and shifting awkwardly, \u201cyou\u2019re the vamp they\u2019re interviewing?\u201d</p><p>YN cringed at his choice of words and sighed with irritation. \u201cYes, I\u2019m the vampire they\u2019re interviewing.\u201d She answered bluntly.</p><p>\u00ac</p><p>\u201cWell, Mrs YLN,\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Miss.\u201d YN answered shortly, forgetting herself and who she was talking with. \u201cSorry, er, I\u2019m just Miss. I\u2019m not married.\u201d</p><p>Mr Azoff smiled at her sweetly, already forgiving her cold interruption without a second thought on it. \u201cMy apologies, Miss YLN, I don\u2019t know how much your friend has told you but we\u2019d really appreciate your help this evening.\u201d</p><p>She wriggled uncomfortably for a short moment. YN had no idea what she was here for, Penny had said nothing, and Mr Azoff had only asked normal interviewing questions and vaguely touched on her abilities. \u201cWhat would I be doing..?\u201d</p><p>Once again Mr Azoff appeared to ignore her irritated and bored composure and smiled brilliantly at her. \u201cIf you hadn\u2019t already noticed my client is holding a show here tonight, and unfortunately with the amount of younger girls here the number of\u2026\u201d He struggled for the right word, \u201charassments that occur has been quite frightening. I understand you haven\u2019t fed for a while and this could be difficult for you, but my client and I\u2019s number one priority is to keep the audience safe. I can\u2019t imagine a better way to do that than with you.\u201d</p><p>The idea was intriguing, for sure. YN had never been one of those vampires who just drank from whoever. Humans deserved as much respect as vampires did, and though humans were certainly larger in numbers (there were only around ten thousand vampires in existence at any one time) it didn\u2019t mean they were disposable. So YN had adopted a system very early on in her life whereby she would only feed from someone who was already dying or could be deemed not worthy of living (like abusers and murderers). Because of her favour for human life she was an outcast within her community, and very few vampires respected they way she lived out her existence. Some had adopted the same habits, though they were often hard to find. To be able to work helping those humans, and possibly feeding at the same time was a win-win, surely?</p><p>\u201cI guess it can\u2019t hurt for one evening.\u201d She agreed, finally smiling at Mr Azoff.</p><p>He beamed at her, standing promptly from his seat in the large arena. \u201cExcellent!\u201d He extended a hand out towards YN, who took it once she stood to give him a gentle shake. \u201cLet me introduce you to a few people, and then we can get you out where we need you.\u201d</p><p>\u00ac</p><p>\u201cWhere is Jeffrey?\u201d Harry grumbled as he dressed himself for the evening in his next outlandish suit.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s recreating Tom Cruise\u2019s ninety four classic.\u201d Mitch snorted at his own joke, assessing his fresh trim in the mirror.</p><p>Harry turned to Mitch with a raised brow. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s in the arena doing an interview. We heard she\u2019s a vamp.\u201d Sarah clarified for him.</p><p>\u201cWhat do we need one of those for?\u201d He frowned, the idea of having one in amongst his fans terrifying him somewhat.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s that one that famously started the \u2018feeding only when they\u2019re cunts\u2019 lifestyle.\u201d Mitch said casually, as if he hadn\u2019t just dropped the \u2018c\u2019 word mid sentence.</p><p>Sarah frowned at Mitch for his choice of word but neglected to mention her disapproval. \u201cYou know the one, can\u2019t remember her name but she\u2019s pretty cool. Loads of vampy talents, loves us hoomans. Saw her in the hall with Jeff earlier and she was super beautiful, not in a way you\u2019d expect though.\u201d</p><p>Harry pursed his lips in thought, shaking his head. \u201cNo, doesn\u2019t ring a bell.\u201d</p><p>\u00ac</p><p>Mr Azoff had introduced YN to a flurry of crew members working on the show that night, mostly those of importance and who she might need to go to for any assistance, though it was incredibly unlikely that would happen.</p><p>\u201cI just need to go and do something real quick.\u201d Mr Azoff gushed as they stopped outside a dressing room door. \u201cWait right here.\u201d</p><p>YN stood awkwardly in the hallway as she waited for Mr Azoff to do his errand, admiring the plethora of artists that littered the walls. She rarely visited events like this, mostly to avoid temptation from the mass amounts of humans, though she often occupied her free time watching old concert performances on Sky Arts just out of curiosity. She didn\u2019t deny that she could probably handle herself if she really had to, but even still, some humans had such a strong and desirable scent it was too much to worth the risk. Any other vampire would just do it.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d A gloriously deep tone hummed at her from down the hall, the vibrations of the voice echoing off the walls like an excited bouncy ball.</p><p>It was instinctive of her to snap her attention to whoever it was without thought, and her heart skipped for the sight in front of her. She recognised him, only for the fact that Penny had his album playing on repeat at all hours of the day, along with any of his previous work. She\u2019d always found him attractive, even for a human, but stood in front of him now, actually in the flesh, he was only what YN could describe as God-like, and definitely worthy. A vampire lifestyle would have suited him so well, there was no doubt about that.</p><p>Harry felt her eyes piercing into his, and they were an incredible sight to behold. Impossibly they were an even darker and more striking green than his own, closer to a rich mossy colour, her pupils dilated so much that their colour was only a thin ring bordering them. Sarah had been right, she was beautiful in a peculiar way, almost as if she was accidentally born of her nature. Yet it still fit her perfectly, as she stood in front of him with a bizarre and unfitting coyness, pulling her sleeve over her hand in an almost uncomfortable and awkward manner.</p><p>Little did Harry know that his scent had YN\u2019s mouth watering instantly, the thumbnail that instinctively sharpened to a point when she grew ravenous threatening to rip through the fabric of her jumper\u2019s cuff, and she was really, really struggling to hold back her natural tendencies. She swallowed the saliva that threatened in her mouth, taking a deep breath to at least attempt to calm the burning desire in her throat.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m, um, just waiting for Mr Azoff.\u201d Her voice was quiet, but still an absolutely lovely sound to listen to. <i>But that\u2019s the way she was meant to be.</i> It\u2019s what they were designed for, to be completely desirable and seductive, even when they weren\u2019t really trying.</p><p>Harry nodded once as he understood that it was definitely her that Jeff had been interviewing. \u201cI see, you\u2019re the vamp he\u2019s hiring?\u201d</p><p>Again with the abbreviation of her kind, she hated how the modern world often ruined such sacred pieces of history. \u201cThat would be me, yes. Just for this evening, anyway.\u201d YN offered a tight smile, averting her gaze from his and back to the frames on the wall.</p><p>\u201cHarold!\u201d Jeff\u2019s booming voice came from behind them. \u201cGood, you\u2019ve already met.\u201d He slapped a hand to Harry\u2019s back and grinned. \u201cYN is helping tonight to\u2026 warden the crowds.\u201d</p><p>Harry nodded. \u201cSo I\u2019ve heard.\u201d His tone was light, though the surly female standing with them admittedly dampened his mood slightly, even if she was a sight to look at.</p><p>YN turned back to Mr Azoff with a small smile, not wanting to appear rude to her temporary employer.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get you settled!\u201d Jeff said with a loud clap of his hands, causing Harry to jump a little as YN barely winced.</p><p>\u00ac</p><p>As the Apollo filled with people YN wandered around through the aisles, ignoring the occasional gawks she received. She attempted to concentrate more on the emotions of the people entering, focussing mostly on those of distress or\u2026 arousal. It grew more difficult as the room became full of gushing fans, some of whom really did smell good, though nowhere near as good as Harry had earlier.</p><p>The show started, and YN became overwhelmed with the fans excitement through the room, making it extremely difficult to focus on much more than the burning in her throat.

No one ever ventured here besides her, and she was convinced that no one else knew it existed.</p><p>When YN found herself back at the arena she was sad to see the show had ended. She frantically searched for the fan she\u2019d helped, feeling a little deflated when she was nowhere to be seen.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s backstage.\u201d Mr Azoff\u2019s voice carried through the emptying room.</p><p>YN whirled to see him waiting by the fence. \u201cShe is?\u201d</p><p>Mr Azoff nodded with a small smirk. \u201cHarry asked to have her and her friend brought backstage after you disappeared. I don\u2019t think he thought you\u2019d come back.\u201d</p><p>She frowned at him him, disappointed that he\u2019d apparently created such a poor impression of her so soon. \u201cOh\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re more than welcome to prove him wrong.\u201d Mr Azoff raised his brows at her with a mischievous grin.</p><p>YN couldn\u2019t help the matching expression she gave him, and followed after him through to the halls she\u2019d been lurking in beforehand. The girl was with Harry, who was keeping a comfortable distance whilst assuring her that he doesn\u2019t intend for anything like that to happen during his performances. She was still evidently upset, her hands shaking as she thanked him for being so wonderful.</p><p>\u201cHope you don\u2019t mind us interrupting,\u201d Jeff knocked lightly on the open door, \u201csomeone came back to check on you.\u201d</p><p>YN peeked in from behind Jeff with a sweet smile. \u201cHi.\u201d</p><p>Harry couldn\u2019t help but notice her eyes again, and the fact that they were now a whole new shade of beautiful butterscotch, no doubt from her unspoken feed. Her hair was damp, no longer in the little bun it had been in earlier as it fell around her shoulders. Had she really had time to shower? He also noticed that she seemed much more relaxed, even as she walked into the room to embrace the grateful girl, she didn\u2019t seem so uptight. So that was it, she really was just hungry earlier. </p><p>He was glad that she had come back, it meant she really was different to all the other vamps out there who treated humans like shit on their shoes. Whoever YN was, she was lovely, and she was special.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"376\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"stylesinthewild:LOn-DkE_VAFK70lpIK4nFQ:Z-899i2Tn6uej\"><img alt=\"image\" src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/59d5076871a36e1bbfc54b092bbc4066/tumblr_p25n2iUONi1v6scw1o1_500.gif\" data-orig-height=\"376\" data-orig-width=\"500\"></figure><p><b>~<a href=\"http://waitingfortwilight.tumblr.com/post/182788617844/blood-like-wine-part-ii\">Part II</a>~</b></p><p>Thank you babies! &lt;3</p></p>",

She was hungry, lack of work had denied her the opportunity to feed for a poor amount of time and it was making her weak and restless. That paired with the swarms of people around could only be a recipe for disaster.</p><p>\u201cI know, I know! But you gave me an idea the other day when you were saying how good you\u2019d felt after helping that girl away from\u2026 you know.\u201d Penny trailed off at the end of her sentence, too afraid to speak the words aloud.</p><p>Two hundred years <i>had</i> thankfully prepared YN for the moment almost a month ago when she witnessed a poor girl about to be violently attacked. It was horrible at first, feeling both the victim\u2019s and the attacker\u2019s emotions so close to her, but once she\u2019d tore the sick bastard from the quivering girl\u2019s frame and drained the life from him in the large and vacant woodland she frequented to feed, she\u2019d actually felt good about herself for once.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d Penny had skipped the line and was now stood grinning in front of a large security guard, \u201cwe have an appointment with, er\u2026 Jeff. Azoff.\u201d</p><p>The bouncer raised his brows at Penny as if to say \u2018really?\u2019, but never actually said anything to her, he just stood watching her, silently telling her \u2018nice try\u2019.</p><p>Penny panicked internally, shuffling around herself to get YN\u2019s attention, who was too busy staring at the homeless person across the street. <i>Was it acceptable to end his life? He had nothing and no one\u2026 no one would miss him.</i></p><p>\u201cYN!\u201d Penny hissed, smacking the top of her arm a couple of times. \u201cTake your sunnies off for God\u2019s sake.\u201d</p><p><i>Get out of your arse, YN! You can\u2019t murder a helpless innocent!</i> Reluctantly peeling the dark shades from her face, she shoved them into her bag and smiled awkwardly at the the towering guard.</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d the guard was suddenly wide eyed and shifting awkwardly, \u201cyou\u2019re the vamp they\u2019re interviewing?\u201d</p><p>YN cringed at his choice of words and sighed with irritation. \u201cYes, I\u2019m the vampire they\u2019re interviewing.\u201d She answered bluntly.</p><p>\u00ac</p><p>\u201cWell, Mrs YLN,\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Miss.\u201d YN answered shortly, forgetting herself and who she was talking with. \u201cSorry, er, I\u2019m just Miss. I\u2019m not married.\u201d</p><p>Mr Azoff smiled at her sweetly, already forgiving her cold interruption without a second thought on it. \u201cMy apologies, Miss YLN, I don\u2019t know how much your friend has told you but we\u2019d really appreciate your help this evening.\u201d</p><p>She wriggled uncomfortably for a short moment. YN had no idea what she was here for, Penny had said nothing, and Mr Azoff had only asked normal interviewing questions and vaguely touched on her abilities. \u201cWhat would I be doing..?\u201d</p><p>Once again Mr Azoff appeared to ignore her irritated and bored composure and smiled brilliantly at her. \u201cIf you hadn\u2019t already noticed my client is holding a show here tonight, and unfortunately with the amount of younger girls here the number of\u2026\u201d He struggled for the right word, \u201charassments that occur has been quite frightening. I understand you haven\u2019t fed for a while and this could be difficult for you, but my client and I\u2019s number one priority is to keep the audience safe. I can\u2019t imagine a better way to do that than with you.\u201d</p><p>The idea was intriguing, for sure. YN had never been one of those vampires who just drank from whoever. Humans deserved as much respect as vampires did, and though humans were certainly larger in numbers (there were only around ten thousand vampires in existence at any one time) it didn\u2019t mean they were disposable. So YN had adopted a system very early on in her life whereby she would only feed from someone who was already dying or could be deemed not worthy of living (like abusers and murderers). Because of her favour for human life she was an outcast within her community, and very few vampires respected they way she lived out her existence. Some had adopted the same habits, though they were often hard to find. To be able to work helping those humans, and possibly feeding at the same time was a win-win, surely?</p><p>\u201cI guess it can\u2019t hurt for one evening.\u201d She agreed, finally smiling at Mr Azoff.</p><p>He beamed at her, standing promptly from his seat in the large arena. \u201cExcellent!\u201d He extended a hand out towards YN, who took it once she stood to give him a gentle shake. \u201cLet me introduce you to a few people, and then we can get you out where we need you.\u201d</p><p>\u00ac</p><p>\u201cWhere is Jeffrey?\u201d Harry grumbled as he dressed himself for the evening in his next outlandish suit.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s recreating Tom Cruise\u2019s ninety four classic.\u201d Mitch snorted at his own joke, assessing his fresh trim in the mirror.</p><p>Harry turned to Mitch with a raised brow. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s in the arena doing an interview. We heard she\u2019s a vamp.\u201d Sarah clarified for him.</p><p>\u201cWhat do we need one of those for?\u201d He frowned, the idea of having one in amongst his fans terrifying him somewhat.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s that one that famously started the \u2018feeding only when they\u2019re cunts\u2019 lifestyle.\u201d Mitch said casually, as if he hadn\u2019t just dropped the \u2018c\u2019 word mid sentence.</p><p>Sarah frowned at Mitch for his choice of word but neglected to mention her disapproval. \u201cYou know the one, can\u2019t remember her name but she\u2019s pretty cool. Loads of vampy talents, loves us hoomans. Saw her in the hall with Jeff earlier and she was super beautiful, not in a way you\u2019d expect though.\u201d</p><p>Harry pursed his lips in thought, shaking his head. \u201cNo, doesn\u2019t ring a bell.\u201d</p><p>\u00ac</p><p>Mr Azoff had introduced YN to a flurry of crew members working on the show that night, mostly those of importance and who she might need to go to for any assistance, though it was incredibly unlikely that would happen.</p><p>\u201cI just need to go and do something real quick.\u201d Mr Azoff gushed as they stopped outside a dressing room door. \u201cWait right here.\u201d</p><p>YN stood awkwardly in the hallway as she waited for Mr Azoff to do his errand, admiring the plethora of artists that littered the walls. She rarely visited events like this, mostly to avoid temptation from the mass amounts of humans, though she often occupied her free time watching old concert performances on Sky Arts just out of curiosity. She didn\u2019t deny that she could probably handle herself if she really had to, but even still, some humans had such a strong and desirable scent it was too much to worth the risk. Any other vampire would just do it.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d A gloriously deep tone hummed at her from down the hall, the vibrations of the voice echoing off the walls like an excited bouncy ball.</p><p>It was instinctive of her to snap her attention to whoever it was without thought, and her heart skipped for the sight in front of her. She recognised him, only for the fact that Penny had his album playing on repeat at all hours of the day, along with any of his previous work. She\u2019d always found him attractive, even for a human, but stood in front of him now, actually in the flesh, he was only what YN could describe as God-like, and definitely worthy. A vampire lifestyle would have suited him so well, there was no doubt about that.</p><p>Harry felt her eyes piercing into his, and they were an incredible sight to behold. Impossibly they were an even darker and more striking green than his own, closer to a rich mossy colour, her pupils dilated so much that their colour was only a thin ring bordering them. Sarah had been right, she was beautiful in a peculiar way, almost as if she was accidentally born of her nature. Yet it still fit her perfectly, as she stood in front of him with a bizarre and unfitting coyness, pulling her sleeve over her hand in an almost uncomfortable and awkward manner.</p><p>Little did Harry know that his scent had YN\u2019s mouth watering instantly, the thumbnail that instinctively sharpened to a point when she grew ravenous threatening to rip through the fabric of her jumper\u2019s cuff, and she was really, really struggling to hold back her natural tendencies. She swallowed the saliva that threatened in her mouth, taking a deep breath to at least attempt to calm the burning desire in her throat.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m, um, just waiting for Mr Azoff.\u201d Her voice was quiet, but still an absolutely lovely sound to listen to. <i>But that\u2019s the way she was meant to be.</i> It\u2019s what they were designed for, to be completely desirable and seductive, even when they weren\u2019t really trying.</p><p>Harry nodded once as he understood that it was definitely her that Jeff had been interviewing. \u201cI see, you\u2019re the vamp he\u2019s hiring?\u201d</p><p>Again with the abbreviation of her kind, she hated how the modern world often ruined such sacred pieces of history. \u201cThat would be me, yes. Just for this evening, anyway.\u201d YN offered a tight smile, averting her gaze from his and back to the frames on the wall.</p><p>\u201cHarold!\u201d Jeff\u2019s booming voice came from behind them. \u201cGood, you\u2019ve already met.\u201d He slapped a hand to Harry\u2019s back and grinned. \u201cYN is helping tonight to\u2026 warden the crowds.\u201d</p><p>Harry nodded. \u201cSo I\u2019ve heard.\u201d His tone was light, though the surly female standing with them admittedly dampened his mood slightly, even if she was a sight to look at.</p><p>YN turned back to Mr Azoff with a small smile, not wanting to appear rude to her temporary employer.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get you settled!\u201d Jeff said with a loud clap of his hands, causing Harry to jump a little as YN barely winced.</p><p>\u00ac</p><p>As the Apollo filled with people YN wandered around through the aisles, ignoring the occasional gawks she received. She attempted to concentrate more on the emotions of the people entering, focussing mostly on those of distress or\u2026 arousal. It grew more difficult as the room became full of gushing fans, some of whom really did smell good, though nowhere near as good as Harry had earlier.</p><p>The show started, and YN became overwhelmed with the fans excitement through the room, making it extremely difficult to focus on much more than the burning in her throat. She continued to move around, catching sight of Harry\u2019s daft antics on stage every now and then and smiling to herself. She was well aware that the marks on her neck and face were probably visible, and was no doubt the reason so many people were staring at her, so to avoid looking like a complete misery she offered each gawker a smile, all of whom suddenly smiled back.</p><p>For a while it all seemed pretty quiet, but then she felt it.</p><p>YN felt that gut wrenching, heart aching feeling of a young girl in distress, coupled with another\u2019s aggression, and she knew this was why she was here. She followed her internal map to the couple caught up in a scurry in the middle of a crowded and utterly packed show. She shoved through the audience, trying to be as polite but as urgent as possible as she squeezed through the crammed floor. There he was, tall and broad, his hands running along this tiny framed girl\u2019s hips and waist as she very obviously tried to wriggle away from him.</p><p>YN braced herself for what she was about to do, ignoring the fact that everyone within a three metre radius had now focussed their attention from Harry\u2019s performance to the horrible scene in front of them.</p><p>Harry had noticed it, noticed the absence of attention after only a few seconds, and he could see one of his fans struggling. YN was right there, and boy was she a confusing sight, one that was simultaneously nightmarish and seductive all at the same time. It was right there and then that Harry knew she\u2019d got it under control, and that it was in everyone\u2019s best interest to carry on as if nothing was happening.</p><p>Running a hand along his back, YN felt the man\u2019s frame stiffen at her delicate touch as she silkily slid between him and the distressed fan. Paying little attention to the girl for the moment, YN forced her gaze into the eyes of her new prey, who had lost all self consciousness and was now completely hers to deal with. She smiled up at him, her eyes full of deceiving warmth as she continued to stroke his chest with one hand. He would be a good feed, his size no doubt enough to keep her going for a few weeks.</p><p>Before YN could finish the deed she turned herself and her prey so that she was facing the stage and the petrified fan. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d The fan nodded furiously, though her tears might suggest otherwise, and YN felt sick for her. Gazing back to the attacker she wrapped her free hand around his throat, her thumbnail grazing the pulsing flesh of the vein on his neck. She met Harry\u2019s eye line momentarily, before closing her eyes and willing her presence into the woodland to dispose of her human conquest.</p><p>The crowd around her gasped as her body vanished with that of the horrible man, and Harry struggled to keep his composure. Why did he insist on watching her when he knew what the outcome would be? Now he felt ill. She probably wouldn\u2019t even come back, vampires were known to be selfish that way.</p><p>The second YN felt the mossy, bark floor beneath her she twisted her prey\u2019s neck, ending his despicable existence. Her nail pierced the soft flesh on his neck, a small bead of thick, crimson blood releasing from the cut. Pressing her lips to the vein her natural instinct took over as she drained the blood from his limp body, finally subsiding the painful flame that had resided in her throat for almost a week. Small and frustrated whimpers escaped her as she drank, the blood not tasting anywhere near as good as she\u2019d hoped. It was dirty, probably ruined from medication or nasty habits, but at least she was fed, and she didn\u2019t have to focus on feeding for a while.</p><p>Hurling the dead man\u2019s body into the small lake with a heavy stone attached to his middle, she watched the little bubbles rise to the surface until they completely stopped and she was satisfied he would never be discovered. It was a horrible way to send someone out of this life and into the next, but he was a terrible man, and she didn\u2019t feel even a little guilty knowing that his body would lie on the cold floor of the lake\u2019s surface, along with all the other bastards she\u2019d drained.</p><p>There was a small waterfall nearby that she would always wash in after a big feed, just to be sure she didn\u2019t return to wherever she came from in a terrifying mess. The cold water never bothered her, she just enjoyed the naturalness of being with the earth as she cleansed herself, both in body and mind. There was something about this place she\u2019d discovered so many years ago, it was like a little capsule of another world. No one ever ventured here besides her, and she was convinced that no one else knew it existed.</p><p>When YN found herself back at the arena she was sad to see the show had ended. She frantically searched for the fan she\u2019d helped, feeling a little deflated when she was nowhere to be seen.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s backstage.\u201d Mr Azoff\u2019s voice carried through the emptying room.</p><p>YN whirled to see him waiting by the fence. \u201cShe is?\u201d</p><p>Mr Azoff nodded with a small smirk. \u201cHarry asked to have her and her friend brought backstage after you disappeared. I don\u2019t think he thought you\u2019d come back.\u201d</p><p>She frowned at him him, disappointed that he\u2019d apparently created such a poor impression of her so soon. \u201cOh\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re more than welcome to prove him wrong.\u201d Mr Azoff raised his brows at her with a mischievous grin.</p><p>YN couldn\u2019t help the matching expression she gave him, and followed after him through to the halls she\u2019d been lurking in beforehand. The girl was with Harry, who was keeping a comfortable distance whilst assuring her that he doesn\u2019t intend for anything like that to happen during his performances. She was still evidently upset, her hands shaking as she thanked him for being so wonderful.</p><p>\u201cHope you don\u2019t mind us interrupting,\u201d Jeff knocked lightly on the open door, \u201csomeone came back to check on you.\u201d</p><p>YN peeked in from behind Jeff with a sweet smile. \u201cHi.\u201d</p><p>Harry couldn\u2019t help but notice her eyes again, and the fact that they were now a whole new shade of beautiful butterscotch, no doubt from her unspoken feed. Her hair was damp, no longer in the little bun it had been in earlier as it fell around her shoulders. Had she really had time to shower? He also noticed that she seemed much more relaxed, even as she walked into the room to embrace the grateful girl, she didn\u2019t seem so uptight. So that was it, she really was just hungry earlier. </p><p>He was glad that she had come back, it meant she really was different to all the other vamps out there who treated humans like shit on their shoes. Whoever YN was, she was lovely, and she was special.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"376\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"stylesinthewild:LOn-DkE_VAFK70lpIK4nFQ:Z-899i2Tn6uej\"><img alt=\"image\" src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/59d5076871a36e1bbfc54b092bbc4066/tumblr_p25n2iUONi1v6scw1o1_500.gif\" data-orig-height=\"376\" data-orig-width=\"500\"></figure><p><b>~<a href=\"http://waitingfortwilight.tumblr.com/post/182788617844/blood-like-wine-part-ii\">Part II</a>~</b></p><p>Thank you babies! &lt;3</p></p>",

She was hungry, lack of work had denied her the opportunity to feed for a poor amount of time and it was making her weak and restless. That paired with the swarms of people around could only be a recipe for disaster.</p><p>&ldquo;I know, I know! But you gave me an idea the other day when you were saying how good you&rsquo;d felt after helping that girl away from&hellip; you know.&rdquo; Penny trailed off at the end of her sentence, too afraid to speak the words aloud.</p><p>Two hundred years <i>had</i> thankfully prepared YN for the moment almost a month ago when she witnessed a poor girl about to be violently attacked. It was horrible at first, feeling both the victim&rsquo;s and the attacker&rsquo;s emotions so close to her, but once she&rsquo;d tore the sick bastard from the quivering girl&rsquo;s frame and drained the life from him in the large and vacant woodland she frequented to feed, she&rsquo;d actually felt good about herself for once.</p><p>&ldquo;Hi,&rdquo; Penny had skipped the line and was now stood grinning in front of a large security guard, &ldquo;we have an appointment with, er&hellip; Jeff. Azoff.&rdquo;</p><p>The bouncer raised his brows at Penny as if to say &lsquo;really?&rsquo;, but never actually said anything to her, he just stood watching her, silently telling her &lsquo;nice try&rsquo;.</p><p>Penny panicked internally, shuffling around herself to get YN&rsquo;s attention, who was too busy staring at the homeless person across the street. <i>Was it acceptable to end his life? He had nothing and no one&hellip; no one would miss him.</i></p><p>&ldquo;YN!&rdquo; Penny hissed, smacking the top of her arm a couple of times. &ldquo;Take your sunnies off for God&rsquo;s sake.&rdquo;</p><p><i>Get out of your arse, YN! You can&rsquo;t murder a helpless innocent!</i> Reluctantly peeling the dark shades from her face, she shoved them into her bag and smiled awkwardly at the the towering guard.</p><p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; the guard was suddenly wide eyed and shifting awkwardly, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re the vamp they&rsquo;re interviewing?&rdquo;</p><p>YN cringed at his choice of words and sighed with irritation. &ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m the vampire they&rsquo;re interviewing.&rdquo; She answered bluntly.</p><p>&not;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, Mrs YLN,&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Miss.&rdquo; YN answered shortly, forgetting herself and who she was talking with. &ldquo;Sorry, er, I&rsquo;m just Miss. I&rsquo;m not married.&rdquo;</p><p>Mr Azoff smiled at her sweetly, already forgiving her cold interruption without a second thought on it. &ldquo;My apologies, Miss YLN, I don&rsquo;t know how much your friend has told you but we&rsquo;d really appreciate your help this evening.&rdquo;</p><p>She wriggled uncomfortably for a short moment. YN had no idea what she was here for, Penny had said nothing, and Mr Azoff had only asked normal interviewing questions and vaguely touched on her abilities. &ldquo;What would I be doing..?&rdquo;</p><p>Once again Mr Azoff appeared to ignore her irritated and bored composure and smiled brilliantly at her. &ldquo;If you hadn&rsquo;t already noticed my client is holding a show here tonight, and unfortunately with the amount of younger girls here the number of&hellip;&rdquo; He struggled for the right word, &ldquo;harassments that occur has been quite frightening. I understand you haven&rsquo;t fed for a while and this could be difficult for you, but my client and I&rsquo;s number one priority is to keep the audience safe. I can&rsquo;t imagine a better way to do that than with you.&rdquo;</p><p>The idea was intriguing, for sure. YN had never been one of those vampires who just drank from whoever. Humans deserved as much respect as vampires did, and though humans were certainly larger in numbers (there were only around ten thousand vampires in existence at any one time) it didn&rsquo;t mean they were disposable. So YN had adopted a system very early on in her life whereby she would only feed from someone who was already dying or could be deemed not worthy of living (like abusers and murderers). Because of her favour for human life she was an outcast within her community, and very few vampires respected they way she lived out her existence. Some had adopted the same habits, though they were often hard to find. To be able to work helping those humans, and possibly feeding at the same time was a win-win, surely?</p><p>&ldquo;I guess it can&rsquo;t hurt for one evening.&rdquo; She agreed, finally smiling at Mr Azoff.</p><p>He beamed at her, standing promptly from his seat in the large arena. &ldquo;Excellent!&rdquo; He extended a hand out towards YN, who took it once she stood to give him a gentle shake. &ldquo;Let me introduce you to a few people, and then we can get you out where we need you.&rdquo;</p><p>&not;</p><p>&ldquo;Where is Jeffrey?&rdquo; Harry grumbled as he dressed himself for the evening in his next outlandish suit.</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s recreating Tom Cruise&rsquo;s ninety four classic.&rdquo; Mitch snorted at his own joke, assessing his fresh trim in the mirror.</p><p>Harry turned to Mitch with a raised brow. &ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s in the arena doing an interview. We heard she&rsquo;s a vamp.&rdquo; Sarah clarified for him.</p><p>&ldquo;What do we need one of those for?&rdquo; He frowned, the idea of having one in amongst his fans terrifying him somewhat.</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s that one that famously started the &lsquo;feeding only when they&rsquo;re cunts&rsquo; lifestyle.&rdquo; Mitch said casually, as if he hadn&rsquo;t just dropped the &lsquo;c&rsquo; word mid sentence.</p><p>Sarah frowned at Mitch for his choice of word but neglected to mention her disapproval. &ldquo;You know the one, can&rsquo;t remember her name but she&rsquo;s pretty cool. Loads of vampy talents, loves us hoomans. Saw her in the hall with Jeff earlier and she was super beautiful, not in a way you&rsquo;d expect though.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry pursed his lips in thought, shaking his head. &ldquo;No, doesn&rsquo;t ring a bell.&rdquo;</p><p>&not;</p><p>Mr Azoff had introduced YN to a flurry of crew members working on the show that night, mostly those of importance and who she might need to go to for any assistance, though it was incredibly unlikely that would happen.</p><p>&ldquo;I just need to go and do something real quick.&rdquo; Mr Azoff gushed as they stopped outside a dressing room door. &ldquo;Wait right here.&rdquo;</p><p>YN stood awkwardly in the hallway as she waited for Mr Azoff to do his errand, admiring the plethora of artists that littered the walls. She rarely visited events like this, mostly to avoid temptation from the mass amounts of humans, though she often occupied her free time watching old concert performances on Sky Arts just out of curiosity. She didn&rsquo;t deny that she could probably handle herself if she really had to, but even still, some humans had such a strong and desirable scent it was too much to worth the risk. Any other vampire would just do it.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you okay?&rdquo; A gloriously deep tone hummed at her from down the hall, the vibrations of the voice echoing off the walls like an excited bouncy ball.</p><p>It was instinctive of her to snap her attention to whoever it was without thought, and her heart skipped for the sight in front of her. She recognised him, only for the fact that Penny had his album playing on repeat at all hours of the day, along with any of his previous work. She&rsquo;d always found him attractive, even for a human, but stood in front of him now, actually in the flesh, he was only what YN could describe as God-like, and definitely worthy. A vampire lifestyle would have suited him so well, there was no doubt about that.</p><p>Harry felt her eyes piercing into his, and they were an incredible sight to behold. Impossibly they were an even darker and more striking green than his own, closer to a rich mossy colour, her pupils dilated so much that their colour was only a thin ring bordering them. Sarah had been right, she was beautiful in a peculiar way, almost as if she was accidentally born of her nature. Yet it still fit her perfectly, as she stood in front of him with a bizarre and unfitting coyness, pulling her sleeve over her hand in an almost uncomfortable and awkward manner.</p><p>Little did Harry know that his scent had YN&rsquo;s mouth watering instantly, the thumbnail that instinctively sharpened to a point when she grew ravenous threatening to rip through the fabric of her jumper&rsquo;s cuff, and she was really, really struggling to hold back her natural tendencies. She swallowed the saliva that threatened in her mouth, taking a deep breath to at least attempt to calm the burning desire in her throat.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m, um, just waiting for Mr Azoff.&rdquo; Her voice was quiet, but still an absolutely lovely sound to listen to. <i>But that&rsquo;s the way she was meant to be.</i> It&rsquo;s what they were designed for, to be completely desirable and seductive, even when they weren&rsquo;t really trying.</p><p>Harry nodded once as he understood that it was definitely her that Jeff had been interviewing. &ldquo;I see, you&rsquo;re the vamp he&rsquo;s hiring?&rdquo;</p><p>Again with the abbreviation of her kind, she hated how the modern world often ruined such sacred pieces of history. &ldquo;That would be me, yes. Just for this evening, anyway.&rdquo; YN offered a tight smile, averting her gaze from his and back to the frames on the wall.</p><p>&ldquo;Harold!&rdquo; Jeff&rsquo;s booming voice came from behind them. &ldquo;Good, you&rsquo;ve already met.&rdquo; He slapped a hand to Harry&rsquo;s back and grinned. &ldquo;YN is helping tonight to&hellip; warden the crowds.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry nodded. &ldquo;So I&rsquo;ve heard.&rdquo; His tone was light, though the surly female standing with them admittedly dampened his mood slightly, even if she was a sight to look at.</p><p>YN turned back to Mr Azoff with a small smile, not wanting to appear rude to her temporary employer.</p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get you settled!&rdquo; Jeff said with a loud clap of his hands, causing Harry to jump a little as YN barely winced.</p><p>&not;</p><p>As the Apollo filled with people YN wandered around through the aisles, ignoring the occasional gawks she received. She attempted to concentrate more on the emotions of the people entering, focussing mostly on those of distress or&hellip; arousal. It grew more difficult as the room became full of gushing fans, some of whom really did smell good, though nowhere near as good as Harry had earlier.</p><p>The show started, and YN became overwhelmed with the fans excitement through the room, making it extremely difficult to focus on much more than the burning in her throat. She continued to move around, catching sight of Harry&rsquo;s daft antics on stage every now and then and smiling to herself. She was well aware that the marks on her neck and face were probably visible, and was no doubt the reason so many people were staring at her, so to avoid looking like a complete misery she offered each gawker a smile, all of whom suddenly smiled back.</p><p>For a while it all seemed pretty quiet, but then she felt it.</p><p>YN felt that gut wrenching, heart aching feeling of a young girl in distress, coupled with another&rsquo;s aggression, and she knew this was why she was here. She followed her internal map to the couple caught up in a scurry in the middle of a crowded and utterly packed show. She shoved through the audience, trying to be as polite but as urgent as possible as she squeezed through the crammed floor. There he was, tall and broad, his hands running along this tiny framed girl&rsquo;s hips and waist as she very obviously tried to wriggle away from him.</p><p>YN braced herself for what she was about to do, ignoring the fact that everyone within a three metre radius had now focussed their attention from Harry&rsquo;s performance to the horrible scene in front of them.</p><p>Harry had noticed it, noticed the absence of attention after only a few seconds, and he could see one of his fans struggling. YN was right there, and boy was she a confusing sight, one that was simultaneously nightmarish and seductive all at the same time. It was right there and then that Harry knew she&rsquo;d got it under control, and that it was in everyone&rsquo;s best interest to carry on as if nothing was happening.</p><p>Running a hand along his back, YN felt the man&rsquo;s frame stiffen at her delicate touch as she silkily slid between him and the distressed fan. Paying little attention to the girl for the moment, YN forced her gaze into the eyes of her new prey, who had lost all self consciousness and was now completely hers to deal with. She smiled up at him, her eyes full of deceiving warmth as she continued to stroke his chest with one hand. He would be a good feed, his size no doubt enough to keep her going for a few weeks.</p><p>Before YN could finish the deed she turned herself and her prey so that she was facing the stage and the petrified fan. &ldquo;Are you okay?&rdquo; The fan nodded furiously, though her tears might suggest otherwise, and YN felt sick for her. Gazing back to the attacker she wrapped her free hand around his throat, her thumbnail grazing the pulsing flesh of the vein on his neck. She met Harry&rsquo;s eye line momentarily, before closing her eyes and willing her presence into the woodland to dispose of her human conquest.</p><p>The crowd around her gasped as her body vanished with that of the horrible man, and Harry struggled to keep his composure. Why did he insist on watching her when he knew what the outcome would be? Now he felt ill. She probably wouldn&rsquo;t even come back, vampires were known to be selfish that way.</p><p>The second YN felt the mossy, bark floor beneath her she twisted her prey&rsquo;s neck, ending his despicable existence. Her nail pierced the soft flesh on his neck, a small bead of thick, crimson blood releasing from the cut. Pressing her lips to the vein her natural instinct took over as she drained the blood from his limp body, finally subsiding the painful flame that had resided in her throat for almost a week. Small and frustrated whimpers escaped her as she drank, the blood not tasting anywhere near as good as she&rsquo;d hoped. It was dirty, probably ruined from medication or nasty habits, but at least she was fed, and she didn&rsquo;t have to focus on feeding for a while.</p><p>Hurling the dead man&rsquo;s body into the small lake with a heavy stone attached to his middle, she watched the little bubbles rise to the surface until they completely stopped and she was satisfied he would never be discovered. It was a horrible way to send someone out of this life and into the next, but he was a terrible man, and she didn&rsquo;t feel even a little guilty knowing that his body would lie on the cold floor of the lake&rsquo;s surface, along with all the other bastards she&rsquo;d drained.</p><p>There was a small waterfall nearby that she would always wash in after a big feed, just to be sure she didn&rsquo;t return to wherever she came from in a terrifying mess. The cold water never bothered her, she just enjoyed the naturalness of being with the earth as she cleansed herself, both in body and mind. There was something about this place she&rsquo;d discovered so many years ago, it was like a little capsule of another world. No one ever ventured here besides her, and she was convinced that no one else knew it existed.</p><p>When YN found herself back at the arena she was sad to see the show had ended. She frantically searched for the fan she&rsquo;d helped, feeling a little deflated when she was nowhere to be seen.</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s backstage.&rdquo; Mr Azoff&rsquo;s voice carried through the emptying room.</p><p>YN whirled to see him waiting by the fence. &ldquo;She is?&rdquo;</p><p>Mr Azoff nodded with a small smirk. &ldquo;Harry asked to have her and her friend brought backstage after you disappeared. I don&rsquo;t think he thought you&rsquo;d come back.&rdquo;</p><p>She frowned at him him, disappointed that he&rsquo;d apparently created such a poor impression of her so soon. &ldquo;Oh&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re more than welcome to prove him wrong.&rdquo; Mr Azoff raised his brows at her with a mischievous grin.</p><p>YN couldn&rsquo;t help the matching expression she gave him, and followed after him through to the halls she&rsquo;d been lurking in beforehand. The girl was with Harry, who was keeping a comfortable distance whilst assuring her that he doesn&rsquo;t intend for anything like that to happen during his performances. She was still evidently upset, her hands shaking as she thanked him for being so wonderful.</p><p>&ldquo;Hope you don&rsquo;t mind us interrupting,&rdquo; Jeff knocked lightly on the open door, &ldquo;someone came back to check on you.&rdquo;</p><p>YN peeked in from behind Jeff with a sweet smile. &ldquo;Hi.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry couldn&rsquo;t help but notice her eyes again, and the fact that they were now a whole new shade of beautiful butterscotch, no doubt from her unspoken feed. Her hair was damp, no longer in the little bun it had been in earlier as it fell around her shoulders. Had she really had time to shower? He also noticed that she seemed much more relaxed, even as she walked into the room to embrace the grateful girl, she didn&rsquo;t seem so uptight. So that was it, she really was just hungry earlier. </p><p>He was glad that she had come back, it meant she really was different to all the other vamps out there who treated humans like shit on their shoes. Whoever YN was, she was lovely, and she was special.</p><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"0\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><p><b>~<a href=\"http://waitingfortwilight.tumblr.com/post/182788617844/blood-like-wine-part-ii\">Part II</a>~</b></p><p>Thank you babies! &lt;3</p></p>",

Is it like that for you too?\u201d Harry asks zayn at 3am. </p><p>- (No it\u2019s hard for me to look away, zayn thinks) </p><p>- \u201cYou don\u2019t look that much like him.\u201d </p><p>- Harry doesn\u2019t miss the wording. You don\u2019t look that much like him. Not you two don\u2019t look that similar. He\u2019s always going to be compared to his brother. It doesn\u2019t matter if he dies trying. </p><p>- So he smiles sadly and says he\u2019s tired. </p><p>- (And leaves Zayn wondering what he said wrong. Shit he\u2019s in so deep, he doesn\u2019t know his head from his arse. And Harry somehow has this contorted notion that he\u2019s in love with Alex. Jesus, maybe it\u2019s better that way. Zayn cannot put him at more risk than he already is.)</p><p>- (\u201cHe thinks I\u2019m in love with you.\u201d He tells Al.) </p><p>- (\u201cYou\u2019re both really fucking stupid for being two of the smartest people i know.\u201d Al replies.) </p><p>- (Zayn doesn\u2019t know if that\u2019s an insult or a compliment) </p><p>- (\u201cDon\u2019t you think it\u2019s really weird cause you two are, you know&hellip;\u201d Zayn makes a face.) </p><p>- (\u201cTwins?\u201d Al deadpans, \u201cYou say it like it\u2019s a bad word. Why would it be weird for my best friend to want to fuck someone who looks like me?\u201d)</p><p>- (\u201cYou\u2019re an asshole.\u201d Zayn declares.) </p><p>- Harry also has an aggressive Alsatian dog called Woo (short for Woovie) that Alex got him for his twentieth birthday. </p><p>- Who is now in Zayn\u2019s apartment because Jesse is sick of babysitting him for Harry. </p><p>- He hates all of them and curls around Harry\u2019s legs protectively whenever he\u2019s around. </p><p>- Zayn didn\u2019t even know unfriendly dogs existed. </p><p>- It\u2019s good for Liam though. </p><p>- Because as much as harry wears garish shirts and has hair long enough that Alex would tut at it, he still looks so much like Alex with a worried frown permanently on his face that lines are starting to blur for Liam.</p><p>- It doesn\u2019t help that he\u2019s incredibly charming and laughs so easily despite obviously suffering inside. </p><p>- And Liam loves Alex, would probably give his life for him. He would never ever go there, but his heart just aches so much for Alex that sometimes he wants to soothe it by hugging Harry within an inch of his life. </p><p>- It doesn\u2019t help that Harry is a tactile person and never refuses a cuddle. </p><p>- Not that Liam\u2019s ever partook in one. It\u2019s only ever Louis and Zayn, mostly Zayn. </p><p>- Zayn, who gravitates towards Harry in the same way he used to with Alex when they\u2019d just become partners. </p><p>- But it\u2019s different, Liam can tell. </p><p>- By the three month mark, Harry takes to roaming the hospital corridors aimlessly for hours after his shift. </p><p>- Zayn, who\u2019s his permanent shadow nowadays, does not comment. </p><p>- Just walks beside him and grabs him by the elbow when he tires himself out enough to start running into walls. </p><p>- It\u2019s hard for Zayn to see Harry fall apart piece by piece right in front of his eyes.</p><p>- (\u201cI can\u2019t\u2013 it\u2019s not right Al, he deserves to know.\u201d) </p><p>- (\u201cYou know we can\u2019t do that.\u201d Al\u2019s eyes harden, \u201cI don\u2019t want to see Haz suffering any more than you do.\u201d) </p><p>- (Zayn swallows, \u201cHe\u2019ll hate me.\u201d) </p><p>- (Al\u2019s eyes soften, \u201cHarry can\u2019t hate anyone, it\u2019s not in his DNA.\u201d) </p><p>- (\u201cYou have the same DNA and you hate almost everyone you meet.\u201d Zayn points out.) </p><p>- (\u201cYeah well, I got his half too which is why I\u2019m more full of spite than the normal person.\u201d) </p><p>- (Zayn smiles, \u201cThey all miss you.\u201d) </p><p>- (\u201cI know.\u201d) </p><p>- \u201cAlex made enemies in high places.\u201d Zayn tells them two months later, \u201cBy the end of our mission we knew we were fucked. There was no way Alex could come back without being hunted by at least five separate organisations.\u201d </p><p>- \u201cWhat are you saying Zayn?\u201d Harry asks after a quiet moment. </p><p>- Zayn can\u2019t look him in the eyes but he has to, he has to, because Harry deserves it. </p><p>- \u201cAlex is alive.\u201d </p><p>- A pin drop silence before Liam makes a sound somewhere between a sob and a growl, \u201cAnd I suppose you knew all along?\u201d </p><p>- Zayn has to steel himself. He doesn\u2019t have the courage to look at Harry anymore. He looks at his shoes instead. </p><p>- \u201cYes, I knew.\u201d And before anyone can open their mouth, he continues, \u201cBut only because I was there and Alex needed my help. He didn\u2019t want to put any of you at risk.\u201d </p><p>- \u201cWhy are you telling us now then? Is he safe now?\u201d Louis asks since neither Harry not Liam seem to be able to speak. </p><p>- Zayn nods, \u201cHe wasn\u2019t in good terms with the government here, so we made a deal with the US government.

                "content": "<p><h1>Zarry Spy Fic (Part 2)</h1><p><a href=\"https://stylesfool.tumblr.com/post/182754007982/zarry-spy-fic-part-1\">Part 1</a></p><p><br /></p><p>- Zayn returns from whatever murder spree he&rsquo;d gone off on to avoid Harry and smiles at him tiredly. </p><p>- So Harry knows there&rsquo;s no hard feelings. </p><p>- &ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard for Liam to look at me sometimes. Is it like that for you too?&rdquo; Harry asks zayn at 3am. </p><p>- (No it&rsquo;s hard for me to look away, zayn thinks) </p><p>- &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t look that much like him.&rdquo; </p><p>- Harry doesn&rsquo;t miss the wording. You don&rsquo;t look that much like him. Not you two don&rsquo;t look that similar. He&rsquo;s always going to be compared to his brother. It doesn&rsquo;t matter if he dies trying. </p><p>- So he smiles sadly and says he&rsquo;s tired. </p><p>- (And leaves Zayn wondering what he said wrong. Shit he&rsquo;s in so deep, he doesn&rsquo;t know his head from his arse. And Harry somehow has this contorted notion that he&rsquo;s in love with Alex. Jesus, maybe it&rsquo;s better that way. Zayn cannot put him at more risk than he already is.)</p><p>- (&ldquo;He thinks I&rsquo;m in love with you.&rdquo; He tells Al.) </p><p>- (&ldquo;You&rsquo;re both really fucking stupid for being two of the smartest people i know.&rdquo; Al replies.) </p><p>- (Zayn doesn&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s an insult or a compliment) </p><p>- (&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think it&rsquo;s really weird cause you two are, you know&hellip;&rdquo; Zayn makes a face.) </p><p>- (&ldquo;Twins?&rdquo; Al deadpans, &ldquo;You say it like it&rsquo;s a bad word. Why would it be weird for my best friend to want to fuck someone who looks like me?&rdquo;)</p><p>- (&ldquo;You&rsquo;re an asshole.&rdquo; Zayn declares.) </p><p>- Harry also has an aggressive Alsatian dog called Woo (short for Woovie) that Alex got him for his twentieth birthday. </p><p>- Who is now in Zayn&rsquo;s apartment because Jesse is sick of babysitting him for Harry. </p><p>- He hates all of them and curls around Harry&rsquo;s legs protectively whenever he&rsquo;s around. </p><p>- Zayn didn&rsquo;t even know unfriendly dogs existed. </p><p>- It&rsquo;s good for Liam though. </p><p>- Because as much as harry wears garish shirts and has hair long enough that Alex would tut at it, he still looks so much like Alex with a worried frown permanently on his face that lines are starting to blur for Liam.</p><p>- It doesn&rsquo;t help that he&rsquo;s incredibly charming and laughs so easily despite obviously suffering inside. </p><p>- And Liam loves Alex, would probably give his life for him. He would never ever go there, but his heart just aches so much for Alex that sometimes he wants to soothe it by hugging Harry within an inch of his life. </p><p>- It doesn&rsquo;t help that Harry is a tactile person and never refuses a cuddle. </p><p>- Not that Liam&rsquo;s ever partook in one. It&rsquo;s only ever Louis and Zayn, mostly Zayn. </p><p>- Zayn, who gravitates towards Harry in the same way he used to with Alex when they&rsquo;d just become partners. </p><p>- But it&rsquo;s different, Liam can tell. </p><p>- By the three month mark, Harry takes to roaming the hospital corridors aimlessly for hours after his shift. </p><p>- Zayn, who&rsquo;s his permanent shadow nowadays, does not comment. </p><p>- Just walks beside him and grabs him by the elbow when he tires himself out enough to start running into walls. </p><p>- It&rsquo;s hard for Zayn to see Harry fall apart piece by piece right in front of his eyes.</p><p>- (&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t&ndash; it&rsquo;s not right Al, he deserves to know.&rdquo;) </p><p>- (&ldquo;You know we can&rsquo;t do that.&rdquo; Al&rsquo;s eyes harden, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to see Haz suffering any more than you do.&rdquo;) </p><p>- (Zayn swallows, &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll hate me.&rdquo;) </p><p>- (Al&rsquo;s eyes soften, &ldquo;Harry can&rsquo;t hate anyone, it&rsquo;s not in his DNA.&rdquo;) </p><p>- (&ldquo;You have the same DNA and you hate almost everyone you meet.&rdquo; Zayn points out.) </p><p>- (&ldquo;Yeah well, I got his half too which is why I&rsquo;m more full of spite than the normal person.&rdquo;) </p><p>- (Zayn smiles, &ldquo;They all miss you.&rdquo;) </p><p>- (&ldquo;I know.&rdquo;) </p><p>- &ldquo;Alex made enemies in high places.&rdquo; Zayn tells them two months later, &ldquo;By the end of our mission we knew we were fucked. There was no way Alex could come back without being hunted by at least five separate organisations.&rdquo; </p><p>- &ldquo;What are you saying Zayn?&rdquo; Harry asks after a quiet moment. </p><p>- Zayn can&rsquo;t look him in the eyes but he has to, he has to, because Harry deserves it. </p><p>- &ldquo;Alex is alive.&rdquo; </p><p>- A pin drop silence before Liam makes a sound somewhere between a sob and a growl, &ldquo;And I suppose you knew all along?&rdquo; </p><p>- Zayn has to steel himself. He doesn&rsquo;t have the courage to look at Harry anymore. He looks at his shoes instead. </p><p>- &ldquo;Yes, I knew.&rdquo; And before anyone can open their mouth, he continues, &ldquo;But only because I was there and Alex needed my help. He didn&rsquo;t want to put any of you at risk.&rdquo; </p><p>- &ldquo;Why are you telling us now then? Is he safe now?&rdquo; Louis asks since neither Harry not Liam seem to be able to speak. </p><p>- Zayn nods, &ldquo;He wasn&rsquo;t in good terms with the government here, so we made a deal with the US government. Immunity in exchange for information. It was a risky line to walk, our bosses were likely to go after him. It&rsquo;s why it took so long.&rdquo; </p><p>- &ldquo;And he didn&rsquo;t think he could trust us?&rdquo; Liam shakes with the restraint on his obvious anger, &ldquo;Trust me?&rdquo; </p><p>- &ldquo;Liam&ndash;&ldquo; </p><p>- &ldquo;No. Don&rsquo;t.&rdquo; He stands up and walks out, shutting the door with such force that Zayn&rsquo;s key bowl falls and shatters. </p><p>- Harry moves back to his apartment a few days later, not having said a single word to Zayn after the broken little &ldquo;why&rdquo; he had uttered to break the silence after Liam had stormed out. </p><p>- Zayn doesn&rsquo;t have an answer for him. </p><p>- Harry meets Alex the day before he leaves the country. </p><p>- &ldquo;Liam broke up with me.&rdquo; Is the first thing Alex tells him. The second is, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, I&rsquo;m so sorry.&rdquo; </p><p>- &ldquo;I understand, and I&rsquo;m sorry too.&rdquo; Harry says. </p><p>- He doesn&rsquo;t tell Alex how Liam visited him once a week at the least and how he had cried for hours the evening before he was supposed to break up with Alex. </p><p>- He doesn&rsquo;t tell him Liam&rsquo;s reasoning for it. How it&rsquo;s not just because Alex had him thinking he was missing and possibly dead for five months. </p><p>- &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be okay.&rdquo; Alex gives him a pathetic attempt of a smile. </p><p>- &ldquo;Yes you will.&rdquo; Harry steps forward and hugs him, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re Alex.&rdquo; </p><p>- Alex hugs him back tightly enough to numb him, &ldquo;Will you visit me?&rdquo; </p><p>- &ldquo;I will try.&rdquo; Harry answers honestly. </p><p>- Alex pulls away and nods. &ldquo;Okay. I&rsquo;m sorry for everything. You deserve a better brother.&rdquo; </p><p>- &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, I don&rsquo;t mind you too much.&rdquo; </p><p>- Alex smiles and Harry smiles back. </p><p>- &ldquo;Take care Allie.&rdquo; </p><p>- &ldquo;You too Hazza.&rdquo; </p><p>- &ldquo;You lied to me for five months.&rdquo; </p><p>- Zayn sighs, &ldquo;I know, and I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo; </p><p>- &ldquo;You also didn&rsquo;t tell me that you tried to convince Alex to tell me he was alive.&rdquo; </p><p>- &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think it would matter.&rdquo; </p><p>- A warm hand covers his and Zayn looks up to meet Harry&rsquo;s eyes. </p><p>- &ldquo;Yeah well, it matters to me.&rdquo; </p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p><p>A/N : This fic has been rotting in my drafts for like 2 years and I knew I was never gonna have the motivation to actually write it.

Keep in mind this was supposed to be a draft for the actual story so there might be some gaps (not major ones). </p><p>(Harry has a twin named Alex. Yes I wrote this after watching Dunkirk.) </p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>- Alex pulls the fire alarm every single time he visits Harry, and Harry gets that he\u2019s a spy and that it\u2019s better if Alex bleeds on the hallway carpet when no one\u2019s there to witness it. But one day it\u2019s gonna be a real fire and Harry\u2019s going to haunt his twin because he didn\u2019t evacuate. He\u2019s pretty sure his neighbours think he\u2019s suicidal. Also the landlord\u2019s getting frustrated trying to figure out why the alarm goes off at odd hours of the night. </p><p>- And Harry\u2019s pissed he\u2019s told this code to his spy friends because now he\u2019s there\u2019s a spy bleeding on his mahogany table. </p><p>- Harry\u2019s pretty sure he put a nail in his own goddamned foot when he graduated med school.

It\u2019s never been me. Do you&hellip;love him?\u201d</p><p>- Perhaps not the best sequence of words to say when they\u2019re all already so torn over Alex. </p><p>- But the way Zayn clenches his jaw and walks away is the only answer Harry needs. </p><p>- It\u2019s fine. It\u2019s really fine. Alex always gets the best of \u2018em. He always has. </p><p>- Except maybe Harry\u2019s a little too attached. </p><p>- Crying on Liam isn\u2019t the best idea. </p><p>- But Harry has never been known for his good ideas. </p><p>- Alex already has Liam, why does he get to have Zayn too? </p><p>- Harry hates himself for the thought because Alex is missing and is possibly hurt or lost or&hellip; </p><p>- Harry doesn\u2019t like to think about the third possibility. </p><p>- Liam and Harry are weirdly okay after the whole cry fest. </p><p>- \u201cCan I, I\u2019m sorry it\u2019s been a long day. Can I just hug you?\u201d Liam asks. </p><p>- And Harry agrees. Because god, he\u2019d give anything to hug alex right now. </p><p>- But then Liam is cupping his cheeks and looking at him with a complicated expression. </p><p>- Harry puts a hand on his wrist. \u201cI\u2019m not him Li\u201d </p><p>- \u201cI know, fuck, do i know.\u201d Liam squeezes his eyes shut like he\u2019s in pain. \u201cYou\u2019re nothing like him. Not even remotely.\u201d </p><p>- \u201cJust because we have the same face doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re not individual people you know\u201d but he says it gently. He doesn\u2019t think liam means any harm. </p><p>- \u201cI didn\u2019t mean that.\u201d Liam ducks his head sheepishly, \u201cOkay maybe a little. I\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t mean to offend. I know that you\u2019re completely different people, but it\u2019s just hard when..\u201d</p><p>- \u201cWhen we look so alike?\u201d Harry grins, not offended in the least. He gets it, kind of. </p><p>- \u201cYeah. You\u2019re just&hellip;you. Alex is more&hellip; he\u2019s seen so much violence, we all have. It\u2019s all we know. We\u2019re hardwired to think the worst of everyone. You just\u2013 you see the world so much differently than us. It\u2019s refreshing. I\u2019ve never seen Alex smile so much\u2013 not the way you do.\u201d</p><p>- Harry puts a hand on Liam\u2019s chest, stopping him in his tracks once again.  \u201cLiam you don\u2019t really want this. You\u2019re tired, it\u2019s been a long day.\u201d </p><p>- Liam snaps back to reality. \u201cI\u2019m sorry you\u2019re right. I\u2019m so sorry. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing. I\u2019m kind of going crazy. Alex has been missing for almost two months now and I\u2013 I can\u2019t lose him Haz, I can\u2019t.\u201d </p><p>- Harry smiles sadly. \u201cMe neither Li.\u201d </p><p>- \u201cI think we\u2019ve been neglecting your feelings.\u201d Liam tells him the next morning. \u201cI think all of us were so caught up in what Alex means to us that we forgot that you\u2019re literally his family.

Which he thinks has to be a good enough reason to trust him. </p><p>- It doesn\u2019t change the fact that Zayn\u2019s just as insufferable as Alex when he\u2019s injured. </p><p>- Also there\u2019s only so many times Jesse will cover for him before he gets his ass fired. </p><p>- So after a lot of stink eye from the spy trio, he\u2019s back at work. </p><p>- And everything\u2019s ok until it isn\u2019t.  </p><p>- And if the spies weren\u2019t being their spy selves and practically stalking Harry without his knowledge, he\u2019d be locked in some basement right now. </p><p>- Liam hugs him so tight, Louis has to pry him away from Harry. Harry sometimes forgets the kind of emotional strain he puts on Liam by just existing.  </p><p>- He doesn\u2019t know if they\u2019d been holding back before somehow, because now all three of them give Harry looks that he doesn\u2019t know what to make of. </p><p>- It\u2019s probably his face, which must look even more like Alex\u2019s with a giant bruise on it. He doesn\u2019t think he will recognise Alex without one now. </p><p>- It also speeds up the safe house process. Zayn\u2019s flat is weirdly nice. </p><p>- He\u2019s also less of an asshole when he\u2019s in his comfort zone. He\u2019s probably swept every nook and cranny of it and has multiple weapons in every part of the place. Harry knows Alex does</p><p>- Cereal is also the only edible thing in his whole flat which is unacceptable. Harry\u2019s a doctor, he refuses to eat sugar for all his meals. </p><p>- Louis and Liam aren\u2019t permanent residents because it draws more attention to Harry to have them here. </p><p>- And Zayn\u2019s healthy enough to take care of him. Which harry doesn\u2019t agree with, because he\u2019s a doctor and knows that his wounds haven\u2019t healed completely. </p><p>- The hospital\u2019s actually closer so Harry doesn\u2019t have to travel too much. And one of the trio is always shadowing him. </p><p>- There\u2019s this way that Zayn looks at him though. It\u2019s even more indecipherable than the other two\u2019s looks. </p><p>- He doesn\u2019t think he wants to know what it\u2019s about. </p><p>- It\u2019s almost 7 weeks since Alex has gone missing and 6 weeks since Harry moved in with Zayn </p><p>- He\u2019s has a hard day and is delusional with exhaustion when he kisses Zayn. </p><p>- Zayn pushes him away which Harry thought would happen, but it doesn\u2019t make it hurt any less. </p><p>- Later, he\u2019d ask Zayn, \u201cIt\u2019s because it\u2019s him isn\u2019t it? It\u2019s never been me. Do you\u2026love him?\u201d</p><p>- Perhaps not the best sequence of words to say when they\u2019re all already so torn over Alex. </p><p>- But the way Zayn clenches his jaw and walks away is the only answer Harry needs. </p><p>- It\u2019s fine. It\u2019s really fine. Alex always gets the best of \u2018em. He always has. </p><p>- Except maybe Harry\u2019s a little too attached. </p><p>- Crying on Liam isn\u2019t the best idea. </p><p>- But Harry has never been known for his good ideas. </p><p>- Alex already has Liam, why does he get to have Zayn too? </p><p>- Harry hates himself for the thought because Alex is missing and is possibly hurt or lost or\u2026 </p><p>- Harry doesn\u2019t like to think about the third possibility. </p><p>- Liam and Harry are weirdly okay after the whole cry fest. </p><p>- \u201cCan I, I\u2019m sorry it\u2019s been a long day. Can I just hug you?\u201d Liam asks. </p><p>- And Harry agrees. Because god, he\u2019d give anything to hug alex right now. </p><p>- But then Liam is cupping his cheeks and looking at him with a complicated expression. </p><p>- Harry puts a hand on his wrist. \u201cI\u2019m not him Li\u201d </p><p>- \u201cI know, fuck, do i know.\u201d Liam squeezes his eyes shut like he\u2019s in pain. \u201cYou\u2019re nothing like him. Not even remotely.\u201d </p><p>- \u201cJust because we have the same face doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re not individual people you know\u201d but he says it gently. He doesn\u2019t think liam means any harm. </p><p>- \u201cI didn\u2019t mean that.\u201d Liam ducks his head sheepishly, \u201cOkay maybe a little. I\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t mean to offend. I know that you\u2019re completely different people, but it\u2019s just hard when..\u201d</p><p>- \u201cWhen we look so alike?\u201d Harry grins, not offended in the least. He gets it, kind of. </p><p>- \u201cYeah. You\u2019re just\u2026you. Alex is more\u2026 he\u2019s seen so much violence, we all have. It\u2019s all we know. We\u2019re hardwired to think the worst of everyone. You just\u2013 you see the world so much differently than us. It\u2019s refreshing. I\u2019ve never seen Alex smile so much\u2013 not the way you do.\u201d</p><p>- Harry puts a hand on Liam\u2019s chest, stopping him in his tracks once again.  \u201cLiam you don\u2019t really want this. You\u2019re tired, it\u2019s been a long day.\u201d </p><p>- Liam snaps back to reality. \u201cI\u2019m sorry you\u2019re right. I\u2019m so sorry. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing. I\u2019m kind of going crazy. Alex has been missing for almost two months now and I\u2013 I can\u2019t lose him Haz, I can\u2019t.\u201d </p><p>- Harry smiles sadly. \u201cMe neither Li.\u201d </p><p>- \u201cI think we\u2019ve been neglecting your feelings.\u201d Liam tells him the next morning. \u201cI think all of us were so caught up in what Alex means to us that we forgot that you\u2019re literally his family. His twin. You ought to be hurting more than any of us.\u201d </p><p>- \u201cYou\u2019re just as much his family as I am.\u201d Harry replies. \u201cI think we\u2019re all hurting. Differently, but hurting all the same. I won\u2019t hold it against you. Besides, you do take care of me, protecting me from the bad guys and all that.\u201d </p><p>- \u201cYou\u2019re too good for this world Harry Styles.\u201d </p><p><a href=\"https://stylesfool.tumblr.com/post/182754074707/zarry-spy-fic-part-2\">Part 2</a></p></p>",
                "content": "<p><h1>Zarry Spy Fic (Part 1) </h1><p>By popular demand of like 5 people, here it goes! I had to divide it in two parts because it was quite lengthy. </p><p>Ps. Keep in mind this was supposed to be a draft for the actual story so there might be some gaps (not major ones). </p><p>(Harry has a twin named Alex. Yes I wrote this after watching Dunkirk.) </p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p><p>- Alex pulls the fire alarm every single time he visits Harry, and Harry gets that he&rsquo;s a spy and that it&rsquo;s better if Alex bleeds on the hallway carpet when no one&rsquo;s there to witness it. But one day it&rsquo;s gonna be a real fire and Harry&rsquo;s going to haunt his twin because he didn&rsquo;t evacuate. He&rsquo;s pretty sure his neighbours think he&rsquo;s suicidal. Also the landlord&rsquo;s getting frustrated trying to figure out why the alarm goes off at odd hours of the night. </p><p>- And Harry&rsquo;s pissed he&rsquo;s told this code to his spy friends because now he&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s a spy bleeding on his mahogany table. </p><p>- Harry&rsquo;s pretty sure he put a nail in his own goddamned foot when he graduated med school. Spies need a lot of fixing up apparently. </p><p>- He&rsquo;s not even surprised when Liam and Louis climb through his fire escape the next night. What&rsquo;s with spies and fire related things? </p><p>- At least it wasn&rsquo;t the alarm. Or maybe that&rsquo;s just code red when spies are bleeding out. If Alex based this whole code on a damn pun, Harry&rsquo;s going to knock him out. </p><p>- When Zayn, the half dead spy taking up his bed, tells them his twin went missing on a mission, Harry&rsquo;s heart stops. </p><p>- Also there&rsquo;s all this talk about moving Harry to a safe location so the people hunting down Alex don&rsquo;t get him instead. </p><p>- Harry tries to be frustrated and go all &lsquo;dammit Alex you idiot&rsquo; because that&rsquo;s easier than losing the little sleep he gets. </p><p>- Apparently compromising Zayn&rsquo;s apartment for their safe base is their best bet. </p><p>- Also, it&rsquo;s just fucking great that Harry and Liam can&rsquo;t face each other because Liam makes this awful lost-puppy expression when he sees Harry. Harry gets it, he looks like Liam&rsquo;s missing fianc&eacute; but Liam&rsquo;s about the only one he knows and trusts. Alex would tut at his wording &lsquo;you should never trust spies&rsquo;. </p><p>- Which Harry knows is Alex pulling his leg because Harry eats up all the spy stereotypes. </p><p>- Harry has never met Zayn before but he knows Alex trusted him with his life. Which he thinks has to be a good enough reason to trust him. </p><p>- It doesn&rsquo;t change the fact that Zayn&rsquo;s just as insufferable as Alex when he&rsquo;s injured. </p><p>- Also there&rsquo;s only so many times Jesse will cover for him before he gets his ass fired. </p><p>- So after a lot of stink eye from the spy trio, he&rsquo;s back at work. </p><p>- And everything&rsquo;s ok until it isn&rsquo;t.  </p><p>- And if the spies weren&rsquo;t being their spy selves and practically stalking Harry without his knowledge, he&rsquo;d be locked in some basement right now. </p><p>- Liam hugs him so tight, Louis has to pry him away from Harry.
