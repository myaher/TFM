You weren&rsquo;t as annoyed anymore when there was a fan who wanted a picture interrupting a date. It also didn&rsquo;t happen as often anymore. Fans knew they could ask Harry for a picture anytime when he was out alone. But when he is out with you, he loved not being bothered. Also, the hate on your social media is almost non-existent. Of course there are still people who don&rsquo;t like you but that&rsquo;s okay.</p><p>You were also known with the fans for recognising them. Fans tweet a lot at you talking about their project they do for Harry like raising money for charity for his birthday and you made sure to support them and give them the promotion they need to achieve their goals.</p><p>Also at his concerts you were often standing in the crowd instead of backstage. You loved being around the fans and their energy and the fans loved it because it gave them a chance to chat with you.</p><p>At the end of the day you all love the same man and want to support him as much as possible and that&rsquo;s why both you and the fans have a good relationship with each other.</p>",

        "body": "<p>\u201cWith\nthis hand, I will lift your sorrows.</p><p>Your cup\nwill never be empty for I will be your wine.</p><p>With\nthis candle, I will light your way in darkness.</p><p>With\nthis ring, I ask you to be mine\u201d</p><p>Harry\nstopped reading and placed the old book on his stomach. It was almost\nunbelievable that he has read this passage in the book countless times yet now\nhe still has to pause and take a deep breath, his vivid imagination of the\nscene gets him every time. Once again, he finds himself in deep thought. Does\nlove always work that way? It is your strength and weakness at the same time,\none moment you are in euphoria but then suddenly when it fails everything is\ndemolished until all that remains is despair and emptiness. But the thing is, harry,\na boy of fourteen, has read only one romance story among his novels about\nadventure and fiction, but in his young state he is highly unlikely planning on\nreading another one anytime soon. It is already queer that he is reading one at\nall, and he finds it even stranger sometimes that he is filled with the desire\nto read it again and again. </p><p>Precise knocks\ncame from the other side of his bedroom door followed by the drone of old\nAlfred asking him to come down for dinner. </p><p>The boy sighed\ntaking it upon himself to be ready for what\u2019s to come. Tonight he will meet his\nfuture bride. His young mind, of course, was full of expectations but questions\nas well. Will she be Vicious? Pretentious? Ambitious? Or perhaps Intelligent? Interesting?\nHe was young and too curious.</p><p>Very soon he was\ncoming down for dinner and finds everyone else seated. As soon as he makes an\nappearance, the small talk slowly dies down and almost everyone stares at him\nexpectantly. To say that he was a blushing mess is an understatement. </p><p>\u201cHarry\u201d his father\nnodded \u201cour young man\u201d he added proudly</p><p>Harry couldn\u2019t\nhelp but be glad. His father\u2019s praises always gave him courage, and of course,\nconfidence. He strode over to the empty seat at the end of the table right\nbeside Gemma. </p><p>They made a toast\nto the future and good health for both families. And so it began.</p><h2><b>Harry</b></h2><p>I couldn\u2019t keep my\neyes to myself. The people occupying the seats were making my mind burst with\nquestions</p><p>The dinner was\nsupposed to be in honor of my future marriage with Victoria, a young lady of\nthe same age as I am. I couldn\u2019t deny that she was beautiful, she had soft\nbrown eyes and dark caramel hair, her sharp cheekbones and defined features\ngave her an aura of profound sophistication, she had a fine figure for her age,\nshe was prim and pristine just like every lad would have dreamed for a bride. I\nwas very delighted at this fact, and couldn\u2019t wait to be able to talk to her in\nprivate and I hope that she would share with me the same interest in books.\nAlthough, right beside her is a very similar person, that peculiarly triggers\nmost of my interest. They had the same air of confidence and sophistication,\nsharp defined features and dark caramel hair. The only significant difference\nbetween them were their eyes, the boy\u2019s sockets -instead of soft brown orbs-\ncontained piercing cerulean eyes. They were the most electrifying blue and I\nwas mildly afraid that making eye contact with the said person would give me a\nminor electric shock. </p><p>Their father, Mr.\nTomlinson was a thin, sharp and brisk man and I found him as mundane as any.\nBut Mrs. Tomlinson was another story, in my opinion, her children were lucky to\ninherit her very pleasant features. \u00a0Only\nshe and the boy had the very same enticing blue eyes. </p>",
