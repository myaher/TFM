And I was just thinking&hellip;I was thinking&hellip;Not trying to be presumptuous, but they&rsquo;re gonna be great. They&rsquo;re gonna be great! I&rsquo;ve been putting out albums since I was sixteen, and it had a pretty predictable schedule. Over and over again, it was kind of the same pattern. Like, I&rsquo;d make an album, I would put out the album, and then I&rsquo;d go on tour. Make an album, put out the album and then I&rsquo;d go on tour. And that happened five albums in a row. And then before I made this album I decided to do something different. I decided to take some time to figure out what my life would be like and what decisions I would make if I didn&rsquo;t have a spotlight on me, and it was really, really, really important for me to do that. I spent a lot of time in the U.K. I really love the U.K. And what was so amazing about the whole thing&hellip; being gone from you and not being on tour, the most amazing thing happened. You understood why I had to take some time and what&rsquo;s even better, you were here when I came back. So thank you so much. I missed you so much. I missed the feeling of standing here and being able to see all the way to the top row. By the way, hi guys! How&rsquo;s everyone doing up top? I missed being able to look out and feel that connection with you guys when we&rsquo;re all singing the same words, because I think one thing that possibly all of us have in common in this sold out stadium is we all like the feeling of connecting with someone else, whether that&rsquo;s making a friend, telling someone you have a crush on them, and them saying that they have a crush on you too, or just having someone say &ldquo;Oh my God I&rsquo;ve been there. I&rsquo;ve experienced what you&rsquo;ve been through too. That&rsquo;s not just you.&rdquo; And so you guys give me that feeling every single time you show up and every single time you care about songs I write about my feelings. And I wanna say thank you for that because when feelings are involved, which they usually are, all that stuff is very, very, very delicate. You know what I mean?",

I was like, this girl is CLEARLY a genius and can see into the nooks and crannies of the soul and make beautiful art from it.</p><p>I\u2019d grown up dating indie boys (and I was kind of an indie girl myself) but I was so sick of how moody and serious and precious and male the whole scene was. I\u2019d also just gone through a breakup, which wasn\u2019t so bad, but had been left a bit open-ended and I was so over the whole thing.</p><p>I immediately went and listened to the song and it was just the perfect anthem to my life right at that moment in time.</p><p>I spent the next year probably exclusively listening to your back catalogue (and tbh I mostly still do). I am still sad that it took me until Red came out to listen to your music. Think of all those wasted years beforehand that I spent listening to boring indie bands I didn\u2019t even like that much!</p><p>- I was so worried about you last year when you were gone. I worried about you every day, not knowing where in the world you were and whether you were okay with the trial pending and everything else going on.</p><p>IMAGINE my surprise when I discovered not only that you were happy and putting together the most amazing music of your career, but that you\u2019d been staying just down the road from me the whole time. Did we see each other in the pub? Walk past each other in the park? Who knows! My mind was blown.</p><p>- I didn\u2019t want to ask you too many questions in case they seemed intrusive and it felt like I was trying to interview you, but I had so many questions! </p><p>- I was also the victim of a grabby hand-up-the-skirt assault. Mine was in a massive crowd late at night somewhere with no CCTV and the guy slithered off into the heaving mass of people so quickly that I barely got a look at him. I didn\u2019t report it at the time because I knew there was no way anything would come of it. </p><p>Now I know better \u2014 I know that even if I was just a statistic to the police, speaking up can make sure that this problem, which is so crazily widespread, is better documented and therefore more visible. Trying to get the world to take this issue seriously is so difficult, but if we stand up and are counted now then maybe we\u2019ll make life a little easier for the women who come after us. By putting yourself through that trial and pursuing justice, you took a bullet for womankind and I\u2019m sure people for generations to come will thank you for that. Thank you from me.
