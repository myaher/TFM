That way you don\u2019t have to go through that whenever you want in or out.\u201d </p><p>\t\u201cWe all have one,\u201d Steve told you as you followed them into an all-glass elevator. </p><p>\tYour breath hitched in your throat as you spun around and the elevator began to climb. Below you, shimmering like thousands of stars were the glimmering lights of New York City. It was a sight you never got tired of, but you had never seen them quite like this before. \u201cWow,\u201d you breathed out excitedly. </p><p>\t\u201cYeah,\u201d Tony said, unable to hide his amusement at your reaction. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely a better view than the one from the precinct.\u201d </p><p>\tYou couldn\u2019t help but smile back at him, even if he was messing with you. \u00a0A moment later, the elevator doors opened and you followed them down a long hallway. You rounded a corner and found yourself standing in an enormous, round, sunken living room with a glass wall that gave you a panoramic view of the city. Sitting in the middle of the room on a collection of plush black sofas were most of the Avengers. Your heart sped up as your excitement began to give way to nervousness. You tried your best to swallow it, reminding yourself that they were just ordinary people. </p><p>\t\u201cGuys,\u201d Steve cleared his throat, drawing their attention to you. \u201cThis is Y/N Y/L/N. She\u2019s our new recruit. She\u2019s going to be staying here and training with us as of tonight.\u201d </p><p>\tRight away, you felt your heart leap into into your throat as the others rose to approach you. This was it, you couldn\u2019t help but think. You were here. Ordinary people, ordinary people, you chanted in your head like a mantra. </p><p>\tYour heart was pounding in your chest as a tall, grinning black man you recognized as Sam Wilson approached you closely followed by a handsome man with a long curtain of dark brown hair &ndash; James Buchanan Barnes. The man formerly known as The Winter Soldier. You had to bite your tongue to keep from grinning like an idiot. </p><p>\t\u201cHey, girl,\u201d Sam greeted you. \u201cI\u2019m Sam. Welcome to the team.\u201d </p><p>\t\u201cHey,\u201d you said, shaking his hand. \u201cThank you.\u201d Then, without thinking about it, you turned to Barnes and started to say, \u201cMr. Barnes &ndash;\u201d </p><p>\tHe cut you off, shaking his head. \u201cCall me Bucky, please,\u201d he couldn\u2019t help but laugh at your apparent nervousness. </p><p>\tYou immediately felt your face burn bright red. \u201cRight,\u201d you said. \u201cBucky, my psychology professor loves you.\u201d </p><p>\tBucky frowned at you. \u201cPsychology?\u201d </p><p>\tYou nodded. \u201cYours is one of the most prominent cases of DID in the history of psychological science. A lot of people were convinced that multiple personalities were a myth until &ndash; well\u2026\u201d You trailed off, not wanting to bring up his traumatic history. </p><p>\tWhy did you just say that? You immediately found yourself wondering as an awkward silence fell over the three of you. Any of that? It couldn\u2019t possibly have been something that he liked to think about. God, you were an idiot. </p><p>\t\u201cY/N!\u201d Natasha called out from the other side of the room. \u201cCome say hi to Wanda and Vis.\u201d </p><p>\tYou smiled apologetically at Sam and Bucky before making your way across the room to where Natasha was. \u201cThank you,\u201d you murmured to her gratefully under your breath. Then you turned to introduce yourself to the girl you recognized as the Scarlet Witch. </p><p>\tSteve and Tony stood back in the doorway, watching you interact with the others. </p><p>\t\u201cIt\u2019s going well,\u201d Steve observed with a smile. </p><p>\t\u201cFor now,\u201d Tony sighed. \u201cI have Friday running a background check on her now. Gotta make sure Y/N doesn\u2019t have any skeletons in her closet if we\u2019re gonna get the charges against her dropped.\u201d </p><p>\tHe and Steve looked up as they were approached by Doctor Bruce Banner and Peter Parker. </p><p>\t\u201cSo new girl, huh?\u201d Bruce asked. \u201cWhat\u2019s her, uh, gift?\u201d </p><p>\t\u201cSome type of shadow manipulation,\u201d Tony informed him. \u201cShe seems to be able to create constructs out of them, but we won\u2019t know the depths of her capabilities until we see her in training.\u201d </p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019ll spar with her,\u201d Peter volunteered a little too eagerly. </p><p>\tSteve couldn\u2019t help but smile at his enthusiasm, all too aware of where the teenager\u2019s mind was. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I\u2019d recommend it. Y/N doesn\u2019t seem to have any qualms about fighting dirty.\u201d </p><p>\t\u201cHe means she castrated a guy earlier this evening,\u201d Tony clarified. </p><p>\tBruce and Peter both stared at them, their smiles faltering. </p><p>\t\u201cShe w-what?\u201d Peter asked, silently praying this disconcerting news about his newest teammate was, in fact, a joke. </p><p>\t\u201cTo be fair, the guy was a rapist,\u201d Steve came to your defense. </p><p>\t\u201cYes, brother, but perhaps &ndash;\u201d </p><p>\tAll four of them looked up as Thor and his brother Loki entered the common room from the hallway that led to the kitchen. They appeared to be deep in conversation, but fell silent once they noticed the others. </p><p>\t\u201cOh, my god!\u201d </p><p>\tTony and Steve turned their attention back to you as a high-pitched squeal sounded across the room. You were staring awestruck at the two Asgardians, all traces of your previous nervousness seemingly vanished. Then, at Natasha\u2019s gentle nudging, you launched yourself at the two brothers, giggling like an over-excited schoolgirl. </p><p>\t\u201cWell, I guess we found out who her favorite Avenger is,\u201d Steve commented, smiling. </p><p>\t\u201cPoint Break\u2019s always had a pretty strong fanbase,\u201d Tony said. </p><p>\tThen their smiles faded as they watched you fling yourself at Loki so unexpectedly that he stumbled over backwards, spilling tea all over the both of you. Thor stared at the two of you in shocked amusement while Loki looked as though he were struggling to decide whether or not he should slap the strange mortal who dared to lay hands on him. <i>Without permission. </i></p><p>\t\u201cUh, shouldn\u2019t someone &ndash;?\u201d Bruce said, his voice trailing off in searching of the right words. </p><p>\tWithout a moment\u2019s hesitation, Tony grabbed Peter by the arm and began to steer him in your direction. \u201cC\u2019mon, Pete, let\u2019s go say hi.\u201d </p><p>\tMeanwhile, you were practically sitting in Loki\u2019s lap, unable to stop yourself from babbling on and on, seemingly to oblivious to the sopping wet tea that was dribbling down the front of your jacket. \u201cOh,\u201d you said excitedly, reaching into your bag to look for your cell phone. \u201cAnd my friend, Mia, she named her cat after you&ndash;\u201d </p><p>\t\u201cAs much as I appreciate your devotion,\u201d the God of Mischief growled, cutting you off. \u201cWould you kindly get off?!\u201d He pushed you away from him with such force that you fell over onto the sofa behind you. </p><p>\tYou brushed it off, giggling, too excited at having met him to actually think straight. </p><p>\t\u201cBrother!\u201d Thor scolded him. \u201cThis is no way to treat your admirers.\u201d He pushed past Loki and knelt in front of you. \u201cYou must forgive my brother, fair lady, as he is yet unaccustomed to your Midgardian culture.\u201d </p><p>\tYou shook your head, starting to say that it was your own fault. Before you could respond, though, Tony appeared at your side, dragging along with him a boy who looked like he was barely old enough to be out of high school. You turned to the two of them smiling. </p><p>\t\u201cY/N, this is Peter,\u201d Tony said, gesturing to the boy who looked deeply uncomfortable to be in your presence. \u201cPeter Parker &ndash; AKA Spiderman. He\u2019s starting classes at NYU next semester.\u201d </p><p>\t\u201cNice to meet you, Peter,\u201d you said, somewhat breathless from your encounter with Loki. </p><p>\t\u201cPlease, don\u2019t castrate me,\u201d Peter said, unable to keep a pleading tone out of his voice. </p><p>\tYou couldn\u2019t help but laugh as Thor and his brother now exchanged concerned looks in the background. \u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d you assured Peter. \u201cI\u2019m not allowed to do that anymore. Tony made me promise.\u201d </p><p>\t\u201cOh,\u201d Peter said, looking immensely relieved. \u201cOh, thank god. I - I mean, Steve did say that guy was a rapist. So I guess he kinda deserved it, right?\u201d </p><p>\t\u201cTotally,\u201d you said, nodding. </p><p>\t\u201cSo,\u201d Tony said, changing the subject quickly. \u201cI see you\u2019re quite the fan of reindeer games here.\u201d </p><p>\tAt hearing mention of his nickname, Loki perked up and said, \u201cYes, just who is this mortal, Stark &ndash; I was not aware that we were simply letting people in off the street.\u201d </p><p>\t\u201cOh, I\u2019m Y/N,\u201d you said, gesturing to yourself. \u201cTony, Steve, and Natasha convinced me to join the Avengers.\u201d </p><p>\tTony nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s right, and she\u2019ll be staying here, so try to play nice, okay?\u201d </p><p>\t\u201cOh, and sorry I tackled you,\u201d you added hastily. \u201cIt won\u2019t happen again.\u201d </p><p>\t\u201cI should hope not,\u201d Loki sneered at you. </p><p>\t\u201cSo tell me, Y/N,\u201d Thor said, grinning broadly. \u201cWhat is it about my younger brother that draws you to him?\u201d </p><p>\tYou felt your cheeks redden at the comment, and you turned your attention to your shoes as you spoke. \u201cI just think it\u2019s really cool how he single-handedly proved the existence of aliens.\u201d </p><p>\tThere was a moment of silence as the others processed what you had just said. </p><p>\t\u201cYou mean when he led the Chitauri attack on New York?\u201d Peter asked finally, uncertain of whether or not he wanted to hear the answer. </p><p>\t\u201cYep,\u201d you said, nodding. </p><p>\t\u201cY/N,\u201d Tony said, now looking more than a little concerned. \u201cWe try not to reward or encourage violent alien invasions.\u201d </p><p>\t\u201cOh, of course not,\u201d you said quickly. \u201cBenevolent contact is always preferred. It\u2019s just so cool that now there\u2019s actual, undeniable proof. I mean, hardly anyone had even heard of the Destroyer debacle in New Mexico, but there\u2019s no writing off a full-scale invasion. Plus, the existence of Asgardians basically confirms Erich von Daniken\u2019s ancient astronaut theory &ndash;\u201d </p><p>\t\u201cYou know what, Y/N?\u201d Tony said, cutting you off. \u201cWhy don\u2019t I show you to your room?\u201d </p><p>\tHe pulled away from the others and led you back down the hallway to the elevator. </p><p>\t\u201cShe scares me,\u201d Peter said, watching the two of you go. </p><hr><p>A/N: Alright, guys, sorry if this chapter was a little short. I will try to make the next one longer. Honestly, I feel like this character is snowballing from awkward to straight-up insane. Who knows what the next chapter will bring. Lol.

Forever. </p><p>\tNatasha reached out and put her hand on your shoulder. \u201cIt\u2019ll be fine,\u201d she said reassuringly. \u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201d </p><hr><p>The guards stationed in the lobby of the tower jumped up from their seats at the reception desk once they saw you.

It\u2019s the best way for us to keep an eye on you. Besides, it\u2019s not like you\u2019ve got a choice after that stunt you pulled tonight.\u201d </p><p>\tSteve pulled out his cellphone. \u201cHe is right. Something like that is bound to have certain consequences.\u201d He began typing out a text. \u201cI\u2019ll let the others know to meet us in the common room.\u201d </p><p>\tYou turned your attention to your fingertips, a sense of excitement and uncertainty building within you. You were going to be an Avenger. Your life was going to change. Everything was going to change. Forever. </p><p>\tNatasha reached out and put her hand on your shoulder. \u201cIt\u2019ll be fine,\u201d she said reassuringly. \u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201d </p><hr><p>The guards stationed in the lobby of the tower jumped up from their seats at the reception desk once they saw you. You paused behind the others, so that they could search you for weapons. Once they were finished, they gestured for you to go ahead. </p><p>\t\u201cSorry about that,\u201d Tony smiled apologetically. \u201cWe\u2019ll get you an ID badge. That way you don\u2019t have to go through that whenever you want in or out.\u201d </p><p>\t\u201cWe all have one,\u201d Steve told you as you followed them into an all-glass elevator. </p><p>\tYour breath hitched in your throat as you spun around and the elevator began to climb. Below you, shimmering like thousands of stars were the glimmering lights of New York City. It was a sight you never got tired of, but you had never seen them quite like this before. \u201cWow,\u201d you breathed out excitedly. </p><p>\t\u201cYeah,\u201d Tony said, unable to hide his amusement at your reaction. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely a better view than the one from the precinct.\u201d </p><p>\tYou couldn\u2019t help but smile back at him, even if he was messing with you. \u00a0A moment later, the elevator doors opened and you followed them down a long hallway. You rounded a corner and found yourself standing in an enormous, round, sunken living room with a glass wall that gave you a panoramic view of the city. Sitting in the middle of the room on a collection of plush black sofas were most of the Avengers. Your heart sped up as your excitement began to give way to nervousness. You tried your best to swallow it, reminding yourself that they were just ordinary people. </p><p>\t\u201cGuys,\u201d Steve cleared his throat, drawing their attention to you. \u201cThis is Y/N Y/L/N. She\u2019s our new recruit. She\u2019s going to be staying here and training with us as of tonight.\u201d </p><p>\tRight away, you felt your heart leap into into your throat as the others rose to approach you. This was it, you couldn\u2019t help but think. You were here. Ordinary people, ordinary people, you chanted in your head like a mantra. </p><p>\tYour heart was pounding in your chest as a tall, grinning black man you recognized as Sam Wilson approached you closely followed by a handsome man with a long curtain of dark brown hair \u2013 James Buchanan Barnes. The man formerly known as The Winter Soldier. You had to bite your tongue to keep from grinning like an idiot. </p><p>\t\u201cHey, girl,\u201d Sam greeted you. \u201cI\u2019m Sam. Welcome to the team.\u201d </p><p>\t\u201cHey,\u201d you said, shaking his hand. \u201cThank you.\u201d Then, without thinking about it, you turned to Barnes and started to say, \u201cMr. Barnes \u2013\u201d </p><p>\tHe cut you off, shaking his head. \u201cCall me Bucky, please,\u201d he couldn\u2019t help but laugh at your apparent nervousness. </p><p>\tYou immediately felt your face burn bright red. \u201cRight,\u201d you said. \u201cBucky, my psychology professor loves you.\u201d </p><p>\tBucky frowned at you. \u201cPsychology?\u201d </p><p>\tYou nodded. \u201cYours is one of the most prominent cases of DID in the history of psychological science. A lot of people were convinced that multiple personalities were a myth until \u2013 well\u2026\u201d You trailed off, not wanting to bring up his traumatic history. </p><p>\tWhy did you just say that? You immediately found yourself wondering as an awkward silence fell over the three of you. Any of that? It couldn\u2019t possibly have been something that he liked to think about. God, you were an idiot. </p><p>\t\u201cY/N!\u201d Natasha called out from the other side of the room. \u201cCome say hi to Wanda and Vis.\u201d </p><p>\tYou smiled apologetically at Sam and Bucky before making your way across the room to where Natasha was. \u201cThank you,\u201d you murmured to her gratefully under your breath. Then you turned to introduce yourself to the girl you recognized as the Scarlet Witch. </p><p>\tSteve and Tony stood back in the doorway, watching you interact with the others. </p><p>\t\u201cIt\u2019s going well,\u201d Steve observed with a smile. </p><p>\t\u201cFor now,\u201d Tony sighed. \u201cI have Friday running a background check on her now. Gotta make sure Y/N doesn\u2019t have any skeletons in her closet if we\u2019re gonna get the charges against her dropped.\u201d </p><p>\tHe and Steve looked up as they were approached by Doctor Bruce Banner and Peter Parker. </p><p>\t\u201cSo new girl, huh?\u201d Bruce asked. \u201cWhat\u2019s her, uh, gift?\u201d </p><p>\t\u201cSome type of shadow manipulation,\u201d Tony informed him. \u201cShe seems to be able to create constructs out of them, but we won\u2019t know the depths of her capabilities until we see her in training.\u201d </p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019ll spar with her,\u201d Peter volunteered a little too eagerly. </p><p>\tSteve couldn\u2019t help but smile at his enthusiasm, all too aware of where the teenager\u2019s mind was. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I\u2019d recommend it. Y/N doesn\u2019t seem to have any qualms about fighting dirty.\u201d </p><p>\t\u201cHe means she castrated a guy earlier this evening,\u201d Tony clarified. </p><p>\tBruce and Peter both stared at them, their smiles faltering. </p><p>\t\u201cShe w-what?\u201d Peter asked, silently praying this disconcerting news about his newest teammate was, in fact, a joke. </p><p>\t\u201cTo be fair, the guy was a rapist,\u201d Steve came to your defense. </p><p>\t\u201cYes, brother, but perhaps \u2013\u201d </p><p>\tAll four of them looked up as Thor and his brother Loki entered the common room from the hallway that led to the kitchen. They appeared to be deep in conversation, but fell silent once they noticed the others. </p><p>\t\u201cOh, my god!\u201d </p><p>\tTony and Steve turned their attention back to you as a high-pitched squeal sounded across the room. You were staring awestruck at the two Asgardians, all traces of your previous nervousness seemingly vanished. Then, at Natasha\u2019s gentle nudging, you launched yourself at the two brothers, giggling like an over-excited schoolgirl. </p><p>\t\u201cWell, I guess we found out who her favorite Avenger is,\u201d Steve commented, smiling. </p><p>\t\u201cPoint Break\u2019s always had a pretty strong fanbase,\u201d Tony said. </p><p>\tThen their smiles faded as they watched you fling yourself at Loki so unexpectedly that he stumbled over backwards, spilling tea all over the both of you. Thor stared at the two of you in shocked amusement while Loki looked as though he were struggling to decide whether or not he should slap the strange mortal who dared to lay hands on him. <i>Without permission. </i></p><p>\t\u201cUh, shouldn\u2019t someone \u2013?\u201d Bruce said, his voice trailing off in searching of the right words. </p><p>\tWithout a moment\u2019s hesitation, Tony grabbed Peter by the arm and began to steer him in your direction. \u201cC\u2019mon, Pete, let\u2019s go say hi.\u201d </p><p>\tMeanwhile, you were practically sitting in Loki\u2019s lap, unable to stop yourself from babbling on and on, seemingly to oblivious to the sopping wet tea that was dribbling down the front of your jacket. \u201cOh,\u201d you said excitedly, reaching into your bag to look for your cell phone. \u201cAnd my friend, Mia, she named her cat after you\u2013\u201d </p><p>\t\u201cAs much as I appreciate your devotion,\u201d the God of Mischief growled, cutting you off. \u201cWould you kindly get off?!\u201d He pushed you away from him with such force that you fell over onto the sofa behind you. </p><p>\tYou brushed it off, giggling, too excited at having met him to actually think straight. </p><p>\t\u201cBrother!\u201d Thor scolded him. \u201cThis is no way to treat your admirers.\u201d He pushed past Loki and knelt in front of you. \u201cYou must forgive my brother, fair lady, as he is yet unaccustomed to your Midgardian culture.\u201d </p><p>\tYou shook your head, starting to say that it was your own fault. Before you could respond, though, Tony appeared at your side, dragging along with him a boy who looked like he was barely old enough to be out of high school. You turned to the two of them smiling. </p><p>\t\u201cY/N, this is Peter,\u201d Tony said, gesturing to the boy who looked deeply uncomfortable to be in your presence. \u201cPeter Parker \u2013 AKA Spiderman. He\u2019s starting classes at NYU next semester.\u201d </p><p>\t\u201cNice to meet you, Peter,\u201d you said, somewhat breathless from your encounter with Loki. </p><p>\t\u201cPlease, don\u2019t castrate me,\u201d Peter said, unable to keep a pleading tone out of his voice. </p><p>\tYou couldn\u2019t help but laugh as Thor and his brother now exchanged concerned looks in the background. \u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d you assured Peter. \u201cI\u2019m not allowed to do that anymore. Tony made me promise.\u201d </p><p>\t\u201cOh,\u201d Peter said, looking immensely relieved. \u201cOh, thank god. I - I mean, Steve did say that guy was a rapist. So I guess he kinda deserved it, right?\u201d </p><p>\t\u201cTotally,\u201d you said, nodding. </p><p>\t\u201cSo,\u201d Tony said, changing the subject quickly. \u201cI see you\u2019re quite the fan of reindeer games here.\u201d </p><p>\tAt hearing mention of his nickname, Loki perked up and said, \u201cYes, just who is this mortal, Stark \u2013 I was not aware that we were simply letting people in off the street.\u201d </p><p>\t\u201cOh, I\u2019m Y/N,\u201d you said, gesturing to yourself. \u201cTony, Steve, and Natasha convinced me to join the Avengers.\u201d </p><p>\tTony nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s right, and she\u2019ll be staying here, so try to play nice, okay?\u201d </p><p>\t\u201cOh, and sorry I tackled you,\u201d you added hastily. \u201cIt won\u2019t happen again.\u201d </p><p>\t\u201cI should hope not,\u201d Loki sneered at you. </p><p>\t\u201cSo tell me, Y/N,\u201d Thor said, grinning broadly. \u201cWhat is it about my younger brother that draws you to him?\u201d </p><p>\tYou felt your cheeks redden at the comment, and you turned your attention to your shoes as you spoke. \u201cI just think it\u2019s really cool how he single-handedly proved the existence of aliens.\u201d </p><p>\tThere was a moment of silence as the others processed what you had just said. </p><p>\t\u201cYou mean when he led the Chitauri attack on New York?\u201d Peter asked finally, uncertain of whether or not he wanted to hear the answer. </p><p>\t\u201cYep,\u201d you said, nodding. </p><p>\t\u201cY/N,\u201d Tony said, now looking more than a little concerned. \u201cWe try not to reward or encourage violent alien invasions.\u201d </p><p>\t\u201cOh, of course not,\u201d you said quickly. \u201cBenevolent contact is always preferred.

You tried your best to swallow it, reminding yourself that they were just ordinary people. </p><p>\t&ldquo;Guys,&rdquo; Steve cleared his throat, drawing their attention to you. &ldquo;This is Y/N Y/L/N. She&rsquo;s our new recruit. She&rsquo;s going to be staying here and training with us as of tonight.&rdquo; </p><p>\tRight away, you felt your heart leap into into your throat as the others rose to approach you. This was it, you couldn&rsquo;t help but think. You were here. Ordinary people, ordinary people, you chanted in your head like a mantra. </p><p>\tYour heart was pounding in your chest as a tall, grinning black man you recognized as Sam Wilson approached you closely followed by a handsome man with a long curtain of dark brown hair &ndash; James Buchanan Barnes. The man formerly known as The Winter Soldier. You had to bite your tongue to keep from grinning like an idiot. </p><p>\t&ldquo;Hey, girl,&rdquo; Sam greeted you. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Sam. Welcome to the team.&rdquo; </p><p>\t&ldquo;Hey,&rdquo; you said, shaking his hand. &ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo; Then, without thinking about it, you turned to Barnes and started to say, &ldquo;Mr. Barnes &ndash;&rdquo; </p><p>\tHe cut you off, shaking his head. &ldquo;Call me Bucky, please,&rdquo; he couldn&rsquo;t help but laugh at your apparent nervousness. </p><p>\tYou immediately felt your face burn bright red. &ldquo;Right,&rdquo; you said. &ldquo;Bucky, my psychology professor loves you.&rdquo; </p><p>\tBucky frowned at you. &ldquo;Psychology?&rdquo; </p><p>\tYou nodded. &ldquo;Yours is one of the most prominent cases of DID in the history of psychological science. A lot of people were convinced that multiple personalities were a myth until &ndash; well&hellip;&rdquo; You trailed off, not wanting to bring up his traumatic history. </p><p>\tWhy did you just say that? You immediately found yourself wondering as an awkward silence fell over the three of you. Any of that? It couldn&rsquo;t possibly have been something that he liked to think about. God, you were an idiot. </p><p>\t&ldquo;Y/N!&rdquo; Natasha called out from the other side of the room. &ldquo;Come say hi to Wanda and Vis.&rdquo; </p><p>\tYou smiled apologetically at Sam and Bucky before making your way across the room to where Natasha was. &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; you murmured to her gratefully under your breath. Then you turned to introduce yourself to the girl you recognized as the Scarlet Witch. </p><p>\tSteve and Tony stood back in the doorway, watching you interact with the others. </p><p>\t&ldquo;It&rsquo;s going well,&rdquo; Steve observed with a smile. </p><p>\t&ldquo;For now,&rdquo; Tony sighed. &ldquo;I have Friday running a background check on her now. Gotta make sure Y/N doesn&rsquo;t have any skeletons in her closet if we&rsquo;re gonna get the charges against her dropped.&rdquo; </p><p>\tHe and Steve looked up as they were approached by Doctor Bruce Banner and Peter Parker. </p><p>\t&ldquo;So new girl, huh?&rdquo; Bruce asked. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s her, uh, gift?&rdquo; </p><p>\t&ldquo;Some type of shadow manipulation,&rdquo; Tony informed him. &ldquo;She seems to be able to create constructs out of them, but we won&rsquo;t know the depths of her capabilities until we see her in training.&rdquo; </p><p>\t&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll spar with her,&rdquo; Peter volunteered a little too eagerly. </p><p>\tSteve couldn&rsquo;t help but smile at his enthusiasm, all too aware of where the teenager&rsquo;s mind was. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;d recommend it. Y/N doesn&rsquo;t seem to have any qualms about fighting dirty.&rdquo; </p><p>\t&ldquo;He means she castrated a guy earlier this evening,&rdquo; Tony clarified. </p><p>\tBruce and Peter both stared at them, their smiles faltering. </p><p>\t&ldquo;She w-what?&rdquo; Peter asked, silently praying this disconcerting news about his newest teammate was, in fact, a joke. </p><p>\t&ldquo;To be fair, the guy was a rapist,&rdquo; Steve came to your defense. </p><p>\t&ldquo;Yes, brother, but perhaps &ndash;&rdquo; </p><p>\tAll four of them looked up as Thor and his brother Loki entered the common room from the hallway that led to the kitchen. They appeared to be deep in conversation, but fell silent once they noticed the others. </p><p>\t&ldquo;Oh, my god!&rdquo; </p><p>\tTony and Steve turned their attention back to you as a high-pitched squeal sounded across the room. You were staring awestruck at the two Asgardians, all traces of your previous nervousness seemingly vanished. Then, at Natasha&rsquo;s gentle nudging, you launched yourself at the two brothers, giggling like an over-excited schoolgirl. </p><p>\t&ldquo;Well, I guess we found out who her favorite Avenger is,&rdquo; Steve commented, smiling. </p><p>\t&ldquo;Point Break&rsquo;s always had a pretty strong fanbase,&rdquo; Tony said. </p><p>\tThen their smiles faded as they watched you fling yourself at Loki so unexpectedly that he stumbled over backwards, spilling tea all over the both of you. Thor stared at the two of you in shocked amusement while Loki looked as though he were struggling to decide whether or not he should slap the strange mortal who dared to lay hands on him. <i>Without permission. </i></p><p>\t&ldquo;Uh, shouldn&rsquo;t someone &ndash;?&rdquo; Bruce said, his voice trailing off in searching of the right words. </p><p>\tWithout a moment&rsquo;s hesitation, Tony grabbed Peter by the arm and began to steer him in your direction. &ldquo;C&rsquo;mon, Pete, let&rsquo;s go say hi.&rdquo; </p><p>\tMeanwhile, you were practically sitting in Loki&rsquo;s lap, unable to stop yourself from babbling on and on, seemingly to oblivious to the sopping wet tea that was dribbling down the front of your jacket. &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; you said excitedly, reaching into your bag to look for your cell phone. &ldquo;And my friend, Mia, she named her cat after you&ndash;&rdquo; </p><p>\t&ldquo;As much as I appreciate your devotion,&rdquo; the God of Mischief growled, cutting you off. &ldquo;Would you kindly get off?!&rdquo; He pushed you away from him with such force that you fell over onto the sofa behind you. </p><p>\tYou brushed it off, giggling, too excited at having met him to actually think straight. </p><p>\t&ldquo;Brother!&rdquo; Thor scolded him. &ldquo;This is no way to treat your admirers.&rdquo; He pushed past Loki and knelt in front of you. &ldquo;You must forgive my brother, fair lady, as he is yet unaccustomed to your Midgardian culture.&rdquo; </p><p>\tYou shook your head, starting to say that it was your own fault. Before you could respond, though, Tony appeared at your side, dragging along with him a boy who looked like he was barely old enough to be out of high school. You turned to the two of them smiling. </p><p>\t&ldquo;Y/N, this is Peter,&rdquo; Tony said, gesturing to the boy who looked deeply uncomfortable to be in your presence. &ldquo;Peter Parker &ndash; AKA Spiderman. He&rsquo;s starting classes at NYU next semester.&rdquo; </p><p>\t&ldquo;Nice to meet you, Peter,&rdquo; you said, somewhat breathless from your encounter with Loki. </p><p>\t&ldquo;Please, don&rsquo;t castrate me,&rdquo; Peter said, unable to keep a pleading tone out of his voice. </p><p>\tYou couldn&rsquo;t help but laugh as Thor and his brother now exchanged concerned looks in the background. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry,&rdquo; you assured Peter. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not allowed to do that anymore. Tony made me promise.&rdquo; </p><p>\t&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; Peter said, looking immensely relieved. &ldquo;Oh, thank god. I - I mean, Steve did say that guy was a rapist. So I guess he kinda deserved it, right?&rdquo; </p><p>\t&ldquo;Totally,&rdquo; you said, nodding. </p><p>\t&ldquo;So,&rdquo; Tony said, changing the subject quickly. &ldquo;I see you&rsquo;re quite the fan of reindeer games here.&rdquo; </p><p>\tAt hearing mention of his nickname, Loki perked up and said, &ldquo;Yes, just who is this mortal, Stark &ndash; I was not aware that we were simply letting people in off the street.&rdquo; </p><p>\t&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m Y/N,&rdquo; you said, gesturing to yourself. &ldquo;Tony, Steve, and Natasha convinced me to join the Avengers.&rdquo; </p><p>\tTony nodded. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, and she&rsquo;ll be staying here, so try to play nice, okay?&rdquo; </p><p>\t&ldquo;Oh, and sorry I tackled you,&rdquo; you added hastily. &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t happen again.&rdquo; </p><p>\t&ldquo;I should hope not,&rdquo; Loki sneered at you. </p><p>\t&ldquo;So tell me, Y/N,&rdquo; Thor said, grinning broadly. &ldquo;What is it about my younger brother that draws you to him?&rdquo; </p><p>\tYou felt your cheeks redden at the comment, and you turned your attention to your shoes as you spoke. &ldquo;I just think it&rsquo;s really cool how he single-handedly proved the existence of aliens.&rdquo; </p><p>\tThere was a moment of silence as the others processed what you had just said. </p><p>\t&ldquo;You mean when he led the Chitauri attack on New York?&rdquo; Peter asked finally, uncertain of whether or not he wanted to hear the answer. </p><p>\t&ldquo;Yep,&rdquo; you said, nodding. </p><p>\t&ldquo;Y/N,&rdquo; Tony said, now looking more than a little concerned. &ldquo;We try not to reward or encourage violent alien invasions.&rdquo; </p><p>\t&ldquo;Oh, of course not,&rdquo; you said quickly. &ldquo;Benevolent contact is always preferred. It&rsquo;s just so cool that now there&rsquo;s actual, undeniable proof. I mean, hardly anyone had even heard of the Destroyer debacle in New Mexico, but there&rsquo;s no writing off a full-scale invasion. Plus, the existence of Asgardians basically confirms Erich von Daniken&rsquo;s ancient astronaut theory &ndash;&rdquo; </p><p>\t&ldquo;You know what, Y/N?&rdquo; Tony said, cutting you off. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t I show you to your room?&rdquo; </p><p>\tHe pulled away from the others and led you back down the hallway to the elevator. </p><p>\t&ldquo;She scares me,&rdquo; Peter said, watching the two of you go. </p><hr /><p>A/N: Alright, guys, sorry if this chapter was a little short. I will try to make the next one longer. Honestly, I feel like this character is snowballing from awkward to straight-up insane. Who knows what the next chapter will bring. Lol. Please, like, reblog, and submit feed back. Thank you.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Taglist</b></p><p><b><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m7_MNOSDWqGxEtHrwB8sXcA\">@misadventurous-meridian</a></b></p>",
