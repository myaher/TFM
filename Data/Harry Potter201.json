When Lyra Lestrange\u2019s old headmaster offers her a position as Defence Against the Dark Arts Teacher she finds herself thrown into an adventure involving a secret affair with a colleague, discovering the cure for a disease and dealing with students cursing themselves. Who knew that being a Hogwarts Professor was such a rollercoaster?</i></p><p><i>Set in the school year of 1990-1991 with the prospect of a sequel, or two, on the horizon.</i></p><p><b><i>Rated: E for graphic sex scenes in later chapters. Over 18\u2032s only please.</i></b><br/></p><p><i><b>Word Count: </b>5188</i></p><p><i>Multichapter Fic (Expected to be around 30-35 chapters with a planned sequel which will take place during the Harry Potter Books)</i></p><p><b>Chapter Twenty Three \u2013 Order of Merlin</b></p><p>Albus\u2019 announcement was confirmed the next morning with the arrival of the morning post. Not only did Lyra receive a letter but she found herself the topic on the front page of the The Daily Prophet once more.</p><p><i>LYRA LESTRANGE TO BE YOUNGEST ORDER OF MERLIN RECIPIENT IN HISTORY</i></p><p><i>Written By Rita Skeeter</i></p><p><i>The name Lyra Lestrange dominated headlines last month as she produced a cure to Psyrot, a disease that had been plaguing the Wizarding community for several months. As a result of her contributions to the Healing Arts, Lyra Lestrange finds herself once again thrust into the spotlight as she becomes the youngest ever witch to receive an Order of Merlin.</i></p><!-- more --><p><i>\u201cThere is no doubt in my mind that Lyra Lestrange is worthy of this award,\u201d says Minister of Magic, Cornelius Fudge, \u201cHer discovery has saved numerous lives and she deserves to be recognised for her achievements. She is an inspiration to us all, I hope she will continue her work as a healer and that this award will inspire her, along with other witches and wizards of talent, to push boundaries and enlighten our community.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Despite the support of our Minister, there are still some doubt among the public as to whether Lyra should be a recipient of this prestigious award.</i></p><p><i>\u201cIt\u2019s an absolute disgrace that Lyra is being awarded an OM,\u201d says a disgruntled former colleague and classmate of Lestrange, \u201cGiven her history, I don\u2019t believe she deserves one. She almost killed one of our classmates.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Should we be giving an almost killer and Death Eater sympathiser an award reserved for outstanding citizens?</i></p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why I subscribe to this bloody paper,\u201d Minerva said, throwing her copy onto the table with a large thud. \u201cIt\u2019s all codswallop, that Skeeter woman, I have half a mind- No, I tell you, I am writing her a letter.\u201d</p><p>Lyra laughed, \u201cIt\u2019s fine, Minerva.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like it\u2019s a lie,\u201d Lyra shrugged, \u201cI did do those things they mentioned in the last article, you know it, half the students know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re not that person anymore,\u201d Minerva argued, \u201cYou saved people and that bloody well deserves to be recognised, Lyra.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeople know,\u201d she shrugged, \u201cThat\u2019s enough. They\u2019ll believe what they want to and that\u2019s fine by me.\u201d</p><p>The Transfiguration Professor paused for a moment, slightly perplexed by the maturity her ex-student was showing. She pursed her lips before insisting, \u201cWell, if anyone else gives you grief, you send them straight to me.\u201d</p><p>With a laugh and a nod Lyra left the breakfast table and headed off to her classes. The day progressed rather quickly and with ease, Lyra utilising her free periods to mark assignments and plan her lessons. She found that her students were still in rather high spirits, none seeming to be affected by the reminder that their Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher may be a Death Eater. She did find that a few of them took the time to congratulate her on her nomination for the Order of Merlin. Once her classes were finished, Lyra found herself back in the company of Severus within his office.</p><p>\u201cNow don\u2019t think that just because it was your birthday yesterday and you\u2019re an Order of Merlin nominee that I\u2019ll go easy on you,\u201d Severus warned. His wand was drawn and he had adopted an aggressive dueling stance.</p><p>Lyra acted cool, a smirk formed across her lips, \u201cI would expect you to go harder on me, if anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDraw your wand,\u201d he urged.</p><p>Lyra\u2019s eyes narrowed, her smirk gone. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cToday we practice with the Cruciatus Curse,\u201d he replied, a grim expression firm on his face.</p><p>Lyra breathed in deep, reaching for her wand and twirling it in between her fingers. She closed her eyes and cleared her head before looking him in the eyes.</p><p>\u201cBelieve me when I say that I take no pleasure in this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s necessary,\u201d she replied, \u201cGet on with it.\u201d</p><p>He relaxed his stance a bit, reluctant to start, \u201cLyra, if it\u2019s too much tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have my wand, I know how to use it,\u201d she said, \u201cIt\u2019ll be fine, Severus.\u201d</p><p>He nodded once, firmly, before returning to his position. \u201cCrucio!\u201d he casted.</p><p>A small scream of surprise erupted from Lyra\u2019s throat, she gripped her wand tighter and her face was twisted in pain as the curse weakly burned her insides. \u201cCome on, Sevvy,\u201d she taunted, \u201cIs that all you\u2019ve got?\u201d</p><p>He gritted his teeth in displeasure, \u201cCrucio!\u201d</p><p>Lyra fell to her knees that time, her lips pressed tightly to stop herself from screaming. The curse was more intense, her bones felt as though they were on fire, her head had a piercing ache and her flesh felt as though it was being cut and ripped open.</p><p>It barely lasted a minute before Severus ended the curse but every second of being it it felt like it would drag on forever. He looked into Lyra\u2019s eyes and cast, \u201cLegilimens!\u201d</p><p>Her mind was blank, completely and utterly blank. It was almost as though he had stepped into a void. He released her and there was this smug look on her face, knowing she had achieved it on her first try.</p><p>Severus wouldn\u2019t let his lesson end that quickly, \u201cCrucio!\u201d</p><p>Another small scream escaped her but she quickly quietened herself. Her wand fell from her hands and she held herself, wrapping her arms around her body and her hands tightly squeezed her biceps. The curse ended and she looked up at him.</p><p>\u201cLegilimens!\u201d</p><p>Nothing once more.</p><p>Severus was annoyed, when he had practiced with Dumbledore it had taken him several days before he had mastered it. Now Lyra was there kneeling before him, easily detached from her emotions and memories. He was tempted to see how much it would take her to break, a sadistic side unwinding inside himself.</p><p>No.</p><p>What was he thinking? He loved Lyra, he didn\u2019t want to hurt her.</p><p>She stood up, steadying herself on the desk. She leaned back and twirled her wand between her fingers like a drummer would with their stick. \u201cIs that it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I just out of practice or are you somehow immune to the Cruciatus Curse?\u201d</p><p>She laughed, \u201cIt did feel rather weak in comparison to my mother\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what it\u2019s like to be on the other end from your mother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was regularly used as a disciplinary method both at home and at Durmstrang,\u201d she replied, \u201cAlthough, it was a bit under wraps at Durmstrang. It used either for really bad kids or to encourage the Quidditch players to play better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought things were bad at my house,\u201d he said, \u201cMy father used to belt me. Sometimes he\u2019d make me kneel and balance a book on my head all night long.\u201d</p><p>Lyra stopped twirling her wand and instead looked concerned. \u201cPretty sure that\u2019s more fucked up than the Cruciatus Curse,\u201d Lyra said, \u201cAt least it\u2019s over in an instant. I learned very quickly not to cry and scream because it would just make it worse, maybe that\u2019s why I can be so detached from my emotions. But yeah, your parents punishment sounds really fucked up, Sev.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged.</p><p>\u201cAre you ok?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d he replied, \u201cSo practicing your Occlumency after enduring the Cruciatus Curse seems pretty redundant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably,\u201d she laughed sheepishly, \u201cI mean, occlumency feels pretty second nature to me now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow would you stand up to seeing someone else tortured?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she sighed and tried to imagine it. \u201cI guess it\u2019d depend on who it was, I don\u2019t think I could stomach Draco being tortured, but I think I could keep my emotions in check.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t get too emotional?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps,\u201d she said, \u201cI\u2019ll try my best not to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour best may not be good enough,\u201d he said, \u201cWhat if it was me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSev-\u201d</p><p>\u201cLyra, you\u2019re risking my life and yours if you can\u2019t close your mind,\u201d he said, \u201cI don\u2019t want your best, I want you to do it.\u201d</p><p>She gritted her teeth and nodded, \u201cI understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUse the curse on me,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she was shocked by the request.</p><p>\u201cUse the Cruciatus on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, firmly.</p><p>\u201cWould you refuse if the Dark Lord asked you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I wouldn\u2019t,\u201d she said, \u201cBut the Dark Lord isn\u2019t asking me, you\u2019re asking me to practice on you. I know how the curse works, I can do it if I need-\u201d</p><p>\u201cProve it,\u201d he spat.</p><p>\u201cSev,\u201d she said once more.</p><p>\u201cLyra,\u201d he said sternly, \u201cI\u2019m losing my patience.\u201d</p><p>Hesitantly, Lyra positioned herself in an aggressive stance. \u201cCrucio.\u201d</p><p>A scream ripped from Severus\u2019 throat as he felt pain tear through his body. He dropped to his knees and began to writhe from the burning sensation that coursed through his veins. He clutched onto his head as a sharp pain buried itself into his brain.</p><p>Lyra found no enjoyment in casting the Cruciatus Curse but the intent was there. Her mind was completely detached from her emotions and she allowed herself to watch Severus screaming in pain for several minutes before ending the curse.</p><p>He steadied himself on the table and looked into Lyra\u2019s eyes. There was no remorse, no feeling on the surface that he could easily pluck from her mind. She felt nothing. He watched her close eyes and when she opened them once more it was almost as though the warmth of her personality had returned.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re terrifying,\u201d he said.</p><p>She scratched the back of her head, \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she sighed deeply before continuing. \u201cI spent a long time not feeling, Sev. I wasn\u2019t allowed to show weakness around my parents. I guess it\u2019s second nature to me to just be distant from my feelings. It took a long time to learn how to be\u2026 normal, I guess?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose I chose the right person to fall in love with,\u201d he said.</p><p>She laughed, \u201cI suppose you did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I think that\u2019s it for our lessons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I tortured you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, shaking his head. \u201cLyra, I trust you and I trust you will keep our relationship hidden from the Dark Lord but don\u2019t think that means I won\u2019t test you from time to time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t expect anything less,\u201d she smirked.</p><p>~</p><p>The week seemed to drag on in anticipation of Lyra\u2019s Order of Merlin ceremony. Each day there was a new article about her, one where Albus himself vouched for her then another where Lucius spoke. Things died down after her Uncle gave his take on the story, calling it \u201cutter nonsense\u201d and detailing how he and his wife \u201cguided Lyra back onto the straight and narrow, nurturing her natural talents\u201d. </p><p>The articles were enough to spark doubt in her mind. She began to question the true motivation for the award and who in fact nominated her. She tried to convince herself it didn\u2019t matter but with both Albus and Lucius\u2019 names in the press, she was beginning to suspect them. Either way, her award would cast a brilliant light on both of them and Lyra felt as though her nomination was somehow tainted.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going,\u201d she announced as she entered Severus\u2019 office, slumping herself into a chair. Her arms were folded and her eyes tightly closed, almost like a child.</p><p>It was the night before the ceremony and Lyra had found herself seeking comfort with the man she loved and who had refused to attend the ceremony with her.</p><p>\u201cAnd why are you protesting now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not coming,\u201d she huffed.</p><p>His eyebrows arose in boredom, \u201cWe discussed this days ago, you know why I can\u2019t. Lucius will suspect that we\u2019re in a relationship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one else can come either, it\u2019s just going to be me and Lucius,\u201d Lyra groaned, \u201cI doubt this nomination is even genuine at this point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat on earth do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cObviously it\u2019s some ploy by Lucius to better the Malfoy name,\u201d she said, \u201cLook at the way he spoke about me in the papers.\u201d She put on a voice, \u201c\u2018Oh, this poor orphaned child who was misguided and on the path to the Dark Arts was set straight by me and now she\u2019s a brilliant witch who betters the country\u2019. Absolute bollocks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sound ridiculous,\u201d he said, \u201cDo you really think Lucius would pay the Minister off so you could get an Order of Merlin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t put it past him,\u201d she said, \u201cIt\u2019s either him or Albus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlbus?\u201d he questioned her logic, \u201cAnd what motivation does Albus have?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, he\u2019s obviously not happy that we\u2019re together and if I get the OM all my offers will flood back and bam, I\u2019m gone. He\u2019s also concerned that the Defence Against the Dark Arts curse will nab me somehow and he doesn\u2019t want to wait for it to happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re delusional.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I?\u201d she asked, \u201cIt\u2019s obviously rigged to make me look better and in turn all these wizards benefit off of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did it, you idiot.\u201d</p><p>Lyra wasn\u2019t expecting that answer. She pulled a face, her eyebrows were pressed together as her mind ticked over the words. \u201cWhat?\u201d she asked in disbelief.</p><p>\u201cI nominated you,\u201d he said, emphasising each syllable.</p><p>Her confused expression only worsened, her eyes narrowed and cheeks puffed up. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019ve seen your work and you deserve it,\u201d he said. \u201cYou discovered the cure for a disease within two months. I watched you agonise over every moment, I watched you utilise all the tools you had at your disposal and I saw your brilliant mind at work. You deserve to be recognised for that and you shouldn\u2019t be wasting your time as a teacher or in an office, you should be out there doing real work to benefit the community.\u201d</p><p>Lyra felt uncomfortable with her emotions that were brewing inside her. Yet again, her lover had complimented her and given her approval but this time she didn\u2019t cry. She just sat in her stunned silence.</p><p>He chuckled as he approached her, leaning down to lay a kiss on the top of her head. \u201cI love you, Lyra,\u201d he said.</p><p>She exhaled a small laugh and looked up at him, \u201cI love you too. Are you sure you can\u2019t come?\u201d</p><p>He frowned slightly, \u201cI\u2019m afraid not. I would have loved to share that moment with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s ok,\u201d she said, \u201cI\u2019ll be there when you get yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what will mine be in?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYour bravery,\u201d she said vaguely.</p><p>\u201cMy bravery?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm,\u201d she hummed, \u201cOr your brilliant mind. You could rewrite all our textbooks and bring us into the 21st century. Either that or you\u2019ll help me cure more diseases. I was thinking lycanthropy would be cool.\u201d</p><p>He laughed at her ambition, \u201cPossibly.\u201d</p><p>She smiled at him and as she did she found her mind wandering to imagine a future with him. One, where they would live together and spend their time in solitude; researching, cooking and sleeping together. Lyra felt an intrusion of her thoughts and quickly shut those feelings out.</p><p>Severus smiled sadly at her, \u201cSeems too good to be true. Don\u2019t get too complacent with your Occlumency.\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>~</p><p>The pair spent the night together, as they usually did. Lyra found herself waking up early the next morning, not wanting to get out of bed. She groaned and pulled Severus closer to her.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, my love,\u201d he muttered, \u201cTime for you to go yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to,\u201d she said, her voice muffled from being buried against his back.</p><p>He chuckled and rolled over, wrapping his arm around her and Lyra finding her head resting on his chest. His fingers danced gently on her back, his eyes still shut slightly. \u201cYour family are waiting for you,\u201d he said, Lyra listening to the rumble of his voice through his chest.</p><p>She hummed, \u201cMm, but you\u2019re so sexy when you wake up.\u201d Her hands gliding down towards his free cock.</p><p>\u201cLyra,\u201d he groaned as she wrapped her hand around it and began to lightly tease it. </p><p>\u201cSev,\u201d she mocked as she let go and slid down under the sheets.</p><p>He moaned in bliss as he felt her tongue lick up the length of his cock a few times before she took it into her mouth. She sucked and teased the firm member with her mouth, parting from it a few times to rub him. She looked up at him, watching his eyes closed in pleasure and appreciating how his body looked in the morning light.</p><p>Lyra would continue to alternate between sucking and rubbing, enjoying the sight and sound of him slowly unravelling beneath her. His moans were enchanting, stirring heat in the depth of her stomach. She smirked as he fisted the sheets, attempting to restrain himself from coming quickly down her throat.</p><p>\u201cMy love,\u201d he choked out, \u201cRide me.\u201d</p><p>She obliged, easily straddling him and allowing the length of his cock to slowly be engulfed by the warm wet heart that she hid between her legs. Severus held her hips as he bucked up into them, Lyra merely enjoying the ride. </p><p>His eyes were open now, watching the way her body moved on top of him. His eyes would glance down to watch his dick slowly enter in and out of her. It was taking all his self restraint not flip her over and fuck her silly into the mattress.</p><p>He watched her as her hands found their way to stimulate herself, one hand tugging a nipple and the other firm on her clit. He felt her walls tighten around him as she overstimulated herself. His eyes would alternate between the filthy things she was doing to get herself off and to her face; how beautiful she looked with her eyes closed and her bottom lip sucked in, her teeth biting down yet failing to withhold the moans that escaped her throat.</p><p>Severus couldn\u2019t stand it any longer. He lifted her up and rolled her over to the side, allowing her to fall onto the mattress. He got up and placed himself between her legs, angling down slowly until his member was once again buried deep inside her. </p><p>Lyra moaned at the intrusion. Her eyes closed briefly in pleasure. Her eyes fluttered open once more and watched as he towered over her, thrusting in and out of her, completely driving but lust and greed. It was intoxicating. Her hands pleasured herself and she found herself working closer and closer towards her orgasm. </p><p>He could feel her clenching down hard around him, her breathing became sparse as she held her breath the closer she got to her unraveling. He tried to maintain a steady pace but he could feel his balls tightening as he felt his orgasm near too.</p><p>\u201cCome for me, Lyra,\u201d he whispered, \u201cCome for me, my love.\u201d</p><p>And she did.</p><p>Her hips bucked up into his, a strangled scream escaped her. The look on her face was enough to push him over the edge. He felt her walls pulse as he came inside her. He collapsed on top of her briefly, his skin sticking to hers from the layer of sweat that had accumulated. He rolled to the side and Lyra held his hand.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll shower and I\u2019ll walk you past the anti-apparation barrier,\u201d he said, squeezing her hand.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to come with me?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if I could look Lucius and Narcissa in the eye after shagging their niece,\u201d he said.</p><p>She laughed, \u201cFair call.\u201d</p><p>After a few silent moments together in bed, a tug pulled Lyra out of the bed and towards the bathroom for a shower. They walked side by side through the hallways of Hogwarts, all she wanted was to hold his hand. She gave him a small smile as they reached the Forbidden Forest.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you tonight?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cProvided Cissy and Lucius don\u2019t want you to stay for dinner,\u201d he said.</p><p>She pursed her lips and nodded. Severus reached down to gently caress her face, leaning forward he left a kiss on her forehead. \u201cI\u2019ll see you soon, my love,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d she replied before stepping back slightly and turning on the spot.</p><p>Lyra mentally braced herself at the sight of the Manor. With a deep breath in and slow exhale, she found the nerve to walk down the all too familiar path and back into her family home. She let herself in, hanging her coat on the hanger near the door.</p><p>\u201cOh Lyra,\u201d Narcissa said, darting down the stairs. \u201cHow good to see you again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMorning, Aunty,\u201d she replied, embracing her aunt.</p><p>\u201cCome,\u201d Narcissa said, \u201cWe\u2019ve got to get you looking good and presentable.\u201d</p><p>Narcissa whisked her niece away, taking her back up the stairs and to her and Lucius\u2019 wing of the house. Right next to their shared room was Narcissa\u2019s own personal wardrobe, if one could call it that. It was a room, lined with the latest and greatest fashion. Coats with rich furs and dresses of different colours and fabrics hung back to back, all organised by designer of course. Sitting in the centre was an open set of drawers with boots and heels, along with some handbags.</p><p>Lyra looked indifferent, having seen this all before. Narcissa loved to play fancy dress up with her niece, particularly when she came of age. She would beg to dress her and take her along to fancy balls and tea parties that the pure bloods would hold but Lyra refused.</p><p>Now, Narcissa finally had her moment to pick out the best outfit for Lyra. \u201cSo, what have you been thinking?\u201d she asked Lyra who was standing there looking rather bored.</p><p>She shrugged, \u201cI\u2019m sure whatever you pick will be nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave a look around,\u201d she urged, \u201cTry something.\u201d</p><p>Lyra could tell her aunt was desperate to try and bond with the girl as she had tried several times before. It wasn\u2019t that Lyra didn\u2019t care about her looks, she did, but she just knew that whatever she\u2019d pick would be wrong. She stepped forward and browsed the racks before pulling out a modest black dress that was high cut, with long sleeves and showed off a bit of her legs. \u201cHow about this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you shouldn\u2019t wear black, my dear,\u201d Narcissa said, taking the dress from her niece and putting it back, \u201cYour mother would wear black all the time, it\u2019s a very dominating colour, would leave the wrong impression.\u201d</p><p>Lyra sucked in her lips spotted a red dress with black lace detailing, she pulled it out and looked at it.</p><p>\u201cToo short,\u201d her aunt said, \u201cRed is also a bit aggressive, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Lyra said, shoving the dress back into place.</p><p>She gravitated towards a green velvet wrap dress. \u201cGreat colour and style but velvet is a bit 70\u2019s,\u201d Narcissa said.</p><p>\u201cHow about you pick something out for me?\u201d Lyra said.</p><p>Her aunt nodded and pulled out a white and black polka dot chiffon dress with lace accents, \u201cHow about this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt looks a bit like a sack,\u201d Lyra said.</p><p>\u201cTrust me, it doesn\u2019t look like a sack when it\u2019s on,\u201d Narcissa insisted.</p><p>Lyra reached out and put the dress on, \u201cHuh. It\u2019s actually not too bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cModest and feminine,\u201d Narcissa said, \u201cIt does have a bit of your personality too. I think it\u2019s good. Now shoes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t just wear boots with it?\u201d Lyra asked.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous,\u201d Narcissa said in heightened tone with a dismissive hand wave. She looked around the set of shoes she had before settling for a white pair with a black base, \u201cThese.\u201d</p><p>Lyra took them and slipped them on.</p><p>\u201cOh look at you, Lyra,\u201d Narcissa said, \u201cYou look gorgeous.\u201d</p><p>Lyra looked at herself in the mirror and span around. She did look gorgeous but she didn\u2019t feel like it was here. </p><p>\u201cNow makeup,\u201d her aunt said, drawing her wand.</p><p>Lyra allowed her aunt to go a bit overboard with her makeup but when she looked at the final product she was impressed. Her lips were painted with a nude lipstick and she had a bright base with dreamy eyes that didn\u2019t look too different from her without makeup. She smiled at the sight of herself.</p><p>\u201cI look great,\u201d Lyra said, \u201cThank you, Aunty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re gorgeous,\u201d she said, \u201cMuch prettier than your mother was at your age.\u201d</p><p>Lyra laughed, \u201cYou can\u2019t say that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can because she\u2019s my sister,\u201d Narcissa said, \u201cStill no suitors?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not interested.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you are good at your work and I can accept it if you want to be single for the rest of your life and just work on your research but Lucius told me that there may be something going on with Severus.\u201d</p><p>Lyra had let her guard down a bit too much over the short time with her aunt and her face fell slightly at the mention of Severus, \u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLyra,\u201d Narcissa said, pulling her niece\u2019s hands into hers and looking deep into her eyes. \u201cYou have a duty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve all had to make sacrifices, my dear,\u201d she said squeezing her hands.</p><p>\u201cUncle told me about you two,\u201d Lyra said, \u201cDo you regret it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I was young I did,\u201d Narcissa said, her face softening as she spoke. \u201cIt took me years to get over the relationship I had before him but Lucius respected that. He gave me distance, flowered me with gifts and eventually I fell in love with him and then we had Draco. You\u2019ll learn to adapt to the situation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat made you fall in love with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis kindness, I saw him playing with you when I was babysitting you one afternoon,\u201d she reminisced, \u201cHe was teaching you the piano, he had you propped up on his knee and you were following along. I knew he\u2019d be a great father, although his affection wasn\u2019t as great as it was towards Draco as it was to you.\u201d</p><p>Lyra nodded.</p><p>\u201cIt took time but I do love him,\u201d she said, \u201cYou too will learn to love whomever you marry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMum mentioned Barty Crouch Junior as a potential spouse when I visited,\u201d Lyra said. </p><p>\u201cI would prefer if you didn\u2019t marry a Death Eater,\u201d she replied, \u201cIt caused too much trouble in our relationship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYet you suggested Carrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere aren\u2019t many of the Sacred 28 left to choose from,\u201d Narcissa said.</p><p>A knock on the door was heard, preventing Lyra from dropping a snarky comment. Narcissa flicked her wand towards the door, opening it and revealing her husband.</p><p>\u201cMy two favourite ladies,\u201d he said.</p><p>Narcissa went to greet him with a chaste kiss on the lips and Lyra gave him a brief hug.</p><p>\u201cYou look beautiful, Lyra,\u201d he said, tucking her hair behind her ear and resting a hand on her shoulder. \u201cWe best be off, don\u2019t want to keep the Wizengamot waiting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you not coming, Aunty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I can\u2019t take Draco,\u201d she said, \u201cHe\u2019s too young.\u201d</p><p>Lyra frowned but nodded. </p><p>\u201cNo one from school wanted to come?\u201d Lucius enquired, \u201cSeverus? Or your other colleagues who helped?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, \u201cNo, it was a bit last minute to be honest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not every day a former student receives an Order of Merlin,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019m surprised.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d she shrugged, \u201cI don\u2019t like the attention, anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, there\u2019s sure to be a lot of press,\u201d he said, \u201cBut don\u2019t worry. I had a special chat to Rita Skeeter about the bullshit she\u2019s been writing about you lately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI appreciate it,\u201d Lyra replied, \u201cHopefully today goes without a hitch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, there\u2019ll be a problem if you\u2019re late. Go,\u201d she insisted waving the pair of them away.</p><p>Lucius\u2019 hand rested on her upper back and gently guided out of the room. \u201cWe\u2019ll be using the floo network,\u201d he said.</p><p>She nodded and lead the way down the stairs, through the foyer and into the living room. She stepped into the fireplace after grabbing a handful of floo powder. She sprinkled the powder around her, the green flames starting to lick at her. \u201cMinistry of Magic, Atrium,\u201d she said clearly before being sucked into the fireplace.</p><p>Gracefully, she stepped out of the gilded fireplace and onto the dark hard wood floor of the Atrium. She walked forward a few steps and found herself hounded by a group of reporters. There were bright flashes from a camera, Lyra closing her eyes and wincing away, shocked by the assault. Each reporter was talking over the other and Lyra couldn\u2019t process anything that was being said. </p><p>She felt a hand press lightly on her shoulder, drawing her attention away from the journalists and up to her Uncle. He gave the girl a firm squeeze to reassure her and smiled. A small smirk played across Lyra\u2019s face as she realised the role her Uncle wanted her to play. She was dressed the part of the innocent and demure niece of the wealthy, well-established businessman and she knew what she had to do.</p><p>He looked back at the crowd and affectionately pulled Lyra closer to him, \u201cOne at a time,\u201d he said, \u201cMy dear niece isn\u2019t used to all the attention. We\u2019ll take a few questions before we head off to the ceremony.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiss Lestrange,\u201d a man addressed the young witch, \u201cHow does it feel to be the youngest and one of the few witches to be awarded an Order of Merlin?\u201d</p><p>She smiled, \u201cHonestly, I am honoured and I am so touched to have my work acknowledged to this degree. I never expected to achieve one in my lifetime so it does come as a bit of a surprise to me but I\u2019m just glad my research healed and saved the lives of so many people. I hope that in my receiving of this award I can inspire other young witches and wizards to pursue excellence and work towards a better world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiss Lestrange, how do your parents feel about this?\u201d</p><p>Lyra allowed her face to flicker with a brief look of sadness, \u201cI have very little contact with my biological parents but I am so glad to have my Uncle Lucius by my side as he raised me to be the witch I am today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNarcissa and I are so proud of her work,\u201d Lucius said, giving her an affectionate squeeze, \u201cWe are so glad that despite her parentage that Lyra has turned out to be such a beautiful and intelligent witch.\u201d</p><p>She looked up at her Uncle and smiled, \u201cI consider this man to be my father.\u201d Although she did believe the words she was saying to a degree, she couldn\u2019t help but feel a slight pain in her chest as her thoughts flicked over to the recent memory of her parents in prison.</p><p>\u201cAnd what do you think Emily Wiltshire would have to say about your Order of Merlin, Lyra?\u201d</p><p>That voice. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to regret this, Lyra.\u201d </p><p>It matched the howler she had received.</p><p>The crowd parted slightly and revealed the owner of the voice who spoke out.</p><p>Jack Thompson.</p>",

She almost killed one of our classmates.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Should we be giving an almost killer and Death Eater sympathiser an award reserved for outstanding citizens?</i></p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why I subscribe to this bloody paper,\u201d Minerva said, throwing her copy onto the table with a large thud. \u201cIt\u2019s all codswallop, that Skeeter woman, I have half a mind- No, I tell you, I am writing her a letter.\u201d</p><p>Lyra laughed, \u201cIt\u2019s fine, Minerva.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like it\u2019s a lie,\u201d Lyra shrugged, \u201cI did do those things they mentioned in the last article, you know it, half the students know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re not that person anymore,\u201d Minerva argued, \u201cYou saved people and that bloody well deserves to be recognised, Lyra.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeople know,\u201d she shrugged, \u201cThat\u2019s enough. They\u2019ll believe what they want to and that\u2019s fine by me.\u201d</p><p>The Transfiguration Professor paused for a moment, slightly perplexed by the maturity her ex-student was showing. She pursed her lips before insisting, \u201cWell, if anyone else gives you grief, you send them straight to me.\u201d</p><p>With a laugh and a nod Lyra left the breakfast table and headed off to her classes. The day progressed rather quickly and with ease, Lyra utilising her free periods to mark assignments and plan her lessons. She found that her students were still in rather high spirits, none seeming to be affected by the reminder that their Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher may be a Death Eater. She did find that a few of them took the time to congratulate her on her nomination for the Order of Merlin. Once her classes were finished, Lyra found herself back in the company of Severus within his office.</p><p>\u201cNow don\u2019t think that just because it was your birthday yesterday and you\u2019re an Order of Merlin nominee that I\u2019ll go easy on you,\u201d Severus warned. His wand was drawn and he had adopted an aggressive dueling stance.</p><p>Lyra acted cool, a smirk formed across her lips, \u201cI would expect you to go harder on me, if anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDraw your wand,\u201d he urged.</p><p>Lyra\u2019s eyes narrowed, her smirk gone. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cToday we practice with the Cruciatus Curse,\u201d he replied, a grim expression firm on his face.</p><p>Lyra breathed in deep, reaching for her wand and twirling it in between her fingers. She closed her eyes and cleared her head before looking him in the eyes.</p><p>\u201cBelieve me when I say that I take no pleasure in this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s necessary,\u201d she replied, \u201cGet on with it.\u201d</p><p>He relaxed his stance a bit, reluctant to start, \u201cLyra, if it\u2019s too much tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have my wand, I know how to use it,\u201d she said, \u201cIt\u2019ll be fine, Severus.\u201d</p><p>He nodded once, firmly, before returning to his position. \u201cCrucio!\u201d he casted.</p><p>A small scream of surprise erupted from Lyra\u2019s throat, she gripped her wand tighter and her face was twisted in pain as the curse weakly burned her insides. \u201cCome on, Sevvy,\u201d she taunted, \u201cIs that all you\u2019ve got?\u201d</p><p>He gritted his teeth in displeasure, \u201cCrucio!\u201d</p><p>Lyra fell to her knees that time, her lips pressed tightly to stop herself from screaming. The curse was more intense, her bones felt as though they were on fire, her head had a piercing ache and her flesh felt as though it was being cut and ripped open.</p><p>It barely lasted a minute before Severus ended the curse but every second of being it it felt like it would drag on forever. He looked into Lyra\u2019s eyes and cast, \u201cLegilimens!\u201d</p><p>Her mind was blank, completely and utterly blank. It was almost as though he had stepped into a void. He released her and there was this smug look on her face, knowing she had achieved it on her first try.</p><p>Severus wouldn\u2019t let his lesson end that quickly, \u201cCrucio!\u201d</p><p>Another small scream escaped her but she quickly quietened herself. Her wand fell from her hands and she held herself, wrapping her arms around her body and her hands tightly squeezed her biceps. The curse ended and she looked up at him.</p><p>\u201cLegilimens!\u201d</p><p>Nothing once more.</p><p>Severus was annoyed, when he had practiced with Dumbledore it had taken him several days before he had mastered it. Now Lyra was there kneeling before him, easily detached from her emotions and memories. He was tempted to see how much it would take her to break, a sadistic side unwinding inside himself.</p><p>No.</p><p>What was he thinking? He loved Lyra, he didn\u2019t want to hurt her.</p><p>She stood up, steadying herself on the desk. She leaned back and twirled her wand between her fingers like a drummer would with their stick. \u201cIs that it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I just out of practice or are you somehow immune to the Cruciatus Curse?\u201d</p><p>She laughed, \u201cIt did feel rather weak in comparison to my mother\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what it\u2019s like to be on the other end from your mother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was regularly used as a disciplinary method both at home and at Durmstrang,\u201d she replied, \u201cAlthough, it was a bit under wraps at Durmstrang. It used either for really bad kids or to encourage the Quidditch players to play better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought things were bad at my house,\u201d he said, \u201cMy father used to belt me. Sometimes he\u2019d make me kneel and balance a book on my head all night long.\u201d</p><p>Lyra stopped twirling her wand and instead looked concerned. \u201cPretty sure that\u2019s more fucked up than the Cruciatus Curse,\u201d Lyra said, \u201cAt least it\u2019s over in an instant. I learned very quickly not to cry and scream because it would just make it worse, maybe that\u2019s why I can be so detached from my emotions. But yeah, your parents punishment sounds really fucked up, Sev.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged.</p><p>\u201cAre you ok?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d he replied, \u201cSo practicing your Occlumency after enduring the Cruciatus Curse seems pretty redundant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably,\u201d she laughed sheepishly, \u201cI mean, occlumency feels pretty second nature to me now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow would you stand up to seeing someone else tortured?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she sighed and tried to imagine it. \u201cI guess it\u2019d depend on who it was, I don\u2019t think I could stomach Draco being tortured, but I think I could keep my emotions in check.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t get too emotional?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps,\u201d she said, \u201cI\u2019ll try my best not to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour best may not be good enough,\u201d he said, \u201cWhat if it was me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSev-\u201d</p><p>\u201cLyra, you\u2019re risking my life and yours if you can\u2019t close your mind,\u201d he said, \u201cI don\u2019t want your best, I want you to do it.\u201d</p><p>She gritted her teeth and nodded, \u201cI understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUse the curse on me,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she was shocked by the request.</p><p>\u201cUse the Cruciatus on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, firmly.</p><p>\u201cWould you refuse if the Dark Lord asked you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I wouldn\u2019t,\u201d she said, \u201cBut the Dark Lord isn\u2019t asking me, you\u2019re asking me to practice on you. I know how the curse works, I can do it if I need-\u201d</p><p>\u201cProve it,\u201d he spat.</p><p>\u201cSev,\u201d she said once more.</p><p>\u201cLyra,\u201d he said sternly, \u201cI\u2019m losing my patience.\u201d</p><p>Hesitantly, Lyra positioned herself in an aggressive stance. \u201cCrucio.\u201d</p><p>A scream ripped from Severus\u2019 throat as he felt pain tear through his body. He dropped to his knees and began to writhe from the burning sensation that coursed through his veins. He clutched onto his head as a sharp pain buried itself into his brain.</p><p>Lyra found no enjoyment in casting the Cruciatus Curse but the intent was there. Her mind was completely detached from her emotions and she allowed herself to watch Severus screaming in pain for several minutes before ending the curse.</p><p>He steadied himself on the table and looked into Lyra\u2019s eyes. There was no remorse, no feeling on the surface that he could easily pluck from her mind. She felt nothing. He watched her close eyes and when she opened them once more it was almost as though the warmth of her personality had returned.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re terrifying,\u201d he said.</p><p>She scratched the back of her head, \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she sighed deeply before continuing. \u201cI spent a long time not feeling, Sev. I wasn\u2019t allowed to show weakness around my parents. I guess it\u2019s second nature to me to just be distant from my feelings. It took a long time to learn how to be\u2026 normal, I guess?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose I chose the right person to fall in love with,\u201d he said.</p><p>She laughed, \u201cI suppose you did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I think that\u2019s it for our lessons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I tortured you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, shaking his head. \u201cLyra, I trust you and I trust you will keep our relationship hidden from the Dark Lord but don\u2019t think that means I won\u2019t test you from time to time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t expect anything less,\u201d she smirked.</p><p>~</p><p>The week seemed to drag on in anticipation of Lyra\u2019s Order of Merlin ceremony. Each day there was a new article about her, one where Albus himself vouched for her then another where Lucius spoke. Things died down after her Uncle gave his take on the story, calling it \u201cutter nonsense\u201d and detailing how he and his wife \u201cguided Lyra back onto the straight and narrow, nurturing her natural talents\u201d. </p><p>The articles were enough to spark doubt in her mind. She began to question the true motivation for the award and who in fact nominated her. She tried to convince herself it didn\u2019t matter but with both Albus and Lucius\u2019 names in the press, she was beginning to suspect them. Either way, her award would cast a brilliant light on both of them and Lyra felt as though her nomination was somehow tainted.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going,\u201d she announced as she entered Severus\u2019 office, slumping herself into a chair. Her arms were folded and her eyes tightly closed, almost like a child.</p><p>It was the night before the ceremony and Lyra had found herself seeking comfort with the man she loved and who had refused to attend the ceremony with her.</p><p>\u201cAnd why are you protesting now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not coming,\u201d she huffed.</p><p>His eyebrows arose in boredom, \u201cWe discussed this days ago, you know why I can\u2019t. Lucius will suspect that we\u2019re in a relationship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one else can come either, it\u2019s just going to be me and Lucius,\u201d Lyra groaned, \u201cI doubt this nomination is even genuine at this point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat on earth do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cObviously it\u2019s some ploy by Lucius to better the Malfoy name,\u201d she said, \u201cLook at the way he spoke about me in the papers.\u201d She put on a voice, \u201c\u2018Oh, this poor orphaned child who was misguided and on the path to the Dark Arts was set straight by me and now she\u2019s a brilliant witch who betters the country\u2019. Absolute bollocks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sound ridiculous,\u201d he said, \u201cDo you really think Lucius would pay the Minister off so you could get an Order of Merlin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t put it past him,\u201d she said, \u201cIt\u2019s either him or Albus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlbus?\u201d he questioned her logic, \u201cAnd what motivation does Albus have?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, he\u2019s obviously not happy that we\u2019re together and if I get the OM all my offers will flood back and bam, I\u2019m gone. He\u2019s also concerned that the Defence Against the Dark Arts curse will nab me somehow and he doesn\u2019t want to wait for it to happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re delusional.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I?\u201d she asked, \u201cIt\u2019s obviously rigged to make me look better and in turn all these wizards benefit off of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did it, you idiot.\u201d</p><p>Lyra wasn\u2019t expecting that answer. She pulled a face, her eyebrows were pressed together as her mind ticked over the words. \u201cWhat?\u201d she asked in disbelief.</p><p>\u201cI nominated you,\u201d he said, emphasising each syllable.</p><p>Her confused expression only worsened, her eyes narrowed and cheeks puffed up. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019ve seen your work and you deserve it,\u201d he said. \u201cYou discovered the cure for a disease within two months. I watched you agonise over every moment, I watched you utilise all the tools you had at your disposal and I saw your brilliant mind at work. You deserve to be recognised for that and you shouldn\u2019t be wasting your time as a teacher or in an office, you should be out there doing real work to benefit the community.\u201d</p><p>Lyra felt uncomfortable with her emotions that were brewing inside her. Yet again, her lover had complimented her and given her approval but this time she didn\u2019t cry. She just sat in her stunned silence.</p><p>He chuckled as he approached her, leaning down to lay a kiss on the top of her head. \u201cI love you, Lyra,\u201d he said.</p><p>She exhaled a small laugh and looked up at him, \u201cI love you too. Are you sure you can\u2019t come?\u201d</p><p>He frowned slightly, \u201cI\u2019m afraid not. I would have loved to share that moment with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s ok,\u201d she said, \u201cI\u2019ll be there when you get yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what will mine be in?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYour bravery,\u201d she said vaguely.</p><p>\u201cMy bravery?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm,\u201d she hummed, \u201cOr your brilliant mind. You could rewrite all our textbooks and bring us into the 21st century. Either that or you\u2019ll help me cure more diseases. I was thinking lycanthropy would be cool.\u201d</p><p>He laughed at her ambition, \u201cPossibly.\u201d</p><p>She smiled at him and as she did she found her mind wandering to imagine a future with him. One, where they would live together and spend their time in solitude; researching, cooking and sleeping together. Lyra felt an intrusion of her thoughts and quickly shut those feelings out.</p><p>Severus smiled sadly at her, \u201cSeems too good to be true. Don\u2019t get too complacent with your Occlumency.\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>~</p><p>The pair spent the night together, as they usually did. Lyra found herself waking up early the next morning, not wanting to get out of bed. She groaned and pulled Severus closer to her.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, my love,\u201d he muttered, \u201cTime for you to go yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to,\u201d she said, her voice muffled from being buried against his back.</p><p>He chuckled and rolled over, wrapping his arm around her and Lyra finding her head resting on his chest. His fingers danced gently on her back, his eyes still shut slightly. \u201cYour family are waiting for you,\u201d he said, Lyra listening to the rumble of his voice through his chest.</p><p>She hummed, \u201cMm, but you\u2019re so sexy when you wake up.\u201d Her hands gliding down towards his free cock.</p><p>\u201cLyra,\u201d he groaned as she wrapped her hand around it and began to lightly tease it. </p><p>\u201cSev,\u201d she mocked as she let go and slid down under the sheets.</p><p>He moaned in bliss as he felt her tongue lick up the length of his cock a few times before she took it into her mouth. She sucked and teased the firm member with her mouth, parting from it a few times to rub him. She looked up at him, watching his eyes closed in pleasure and appreciating how his body looked in the morning light.</p><p>Lyra would continue to alternate between sucking and rubbing, enjoying the sight and sound of him slowly unravelling beneath her. His moans were enchanting, stirring heat in the depth of her stomach. She smirked as he fisted the sheets, attempting to restrain himself from coming quickly down her throat.</p><p>\u201cMy love,\u201d he choked out, \u201cRide me.\u201d</p><p>She obliged, easily straddling him and allowing the length of his cock to slowly be engulfed by the warm wet heart that she hid between her legs. Severus held her hips as he bucked up into them, Lyra merely enjoying the ride. </p><p>His eyes were open now, watching the way her body moved on top of him. His eyes would glance down to watch his dick slowly enter in and out of her. It was taking all his self restraint not flip her over and fuck her silly into the mattress.</p><p>He watched her as her hands found their way to stimulate herself, one hand tugging a nipple and the other firm on her clit. He felt her walls tighten around him as she overstimulated herself. His eyes would alternate between the filthy things she was doing to get herself off and to her face; how beautiful she looked with her eyes closed and her bottom lip sucked in, her teeth biting down yet failing to withhold the moans that escaped her throat.</p><p>Severus couldn\u2019t stand it any longer. He lifted her up and rolled her over to the side, allowing her to fall onto the mattress. He got up and placed himself between her legs, angling down slowly until his member was once again buried deep inside her. </p><p>Lyra moaned at the intrusion. Her eyes closed briefly in pleasure. Her eyes fluttered open once more and watched as he towered over her, thrusting in and out of her, completely driving but lust and greed. It was intoxicating. Her hands pleasured herself and she found herself working closer and closer towards her orgasm. </p><p>He could feel her clenching down hard around him, her breathing became sparse as she held her breath the closer she got to her unraveling. He tried to maintain a steady pace but he could feel his balls tightening as he felt his orgasm near too.</p><p>\u201cCome for me, Lyra,\u201d he whispered, \u201cCome for me, my love.\u201d</p><p>And she did.</p><p>Her hips bucked up into his, a strangled scream escaped her. The look on her face was enough to push him over the edge. He felt her walls pulse as he came inside her. He collapsed on top of her briefly, his skin sticking to hers from the layer of sweat that had accumulated. He rolled to the side and Lyra held his hand.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll shower and I\u2019ll walk you past the anti-apparation barrier,\u201d he said, squeezing her hand.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to come with me?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if I could look Lucius and Narcissa in the eye after shagging their niece,\u201d he said.</p><p>She laughed, \u201cFair call.\u201d</p><p>After a few silent moments together in bed, a tug pulled Lyra out of the bed and towards the bathroom for a shower. They walked side by side through the hallways of Hogwarts, all she wanted was to hold his hand. She gave him a small smile as they reached the Forbidden Forest.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you tonight?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cProvided Cissy and Lucius don\u2019t want you to stay for dinner,\u201d he said.</p><p>She pursed her lips and nodded. Severus reached down to gently caress her face, leaning forward he left a kiss on her forehead. \u201cI\u2019ll see you soon, my love,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d she replied before stepping back slightly and turning on the spot.</p><p>Lyra mentally braced herself at the sight of the Manor. With a deep breath in and slow exhale, she found the nerve to walk down the all too familiar path and back into her family home. She let herself in, hanging her coat on the hanger near the door.</p><p>\u201cOh Lyra,\u201d Narcissa said, darting down the stairs. \u201cHow good to see you again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMorning, Aunty,\u201d she replied, embracing her aunt.</p><p>\u201cCome,\u201d Narcissa said, \u201cWe\u2019ve got to get you looking good and presentable.\u201d</p><p>Narcissa whisked her niece away, taking her back up the stairs and to her and Lucius\u2019 wing of the house. Right next to their shared room was Narcissa\u2019s own personal wardrobe, if one could call it that. It was a room, lined with the latest and greatest fashion. Coats with rich furs and dresses of different colours and fabrics hung back to back, all organised by designer of course. Sitting in the centre was an open set of drawers with boots and heels, along with some handbags.</p><p>Lyra looked indifferent, having seen this all before. Narcissa loved to play fancy dress up with her niece, particularly when she came of age. She would beg to dress her and take her along to fancy balls and tea parties that the pure bloods would hold but Lyra refused.</p><p>Now, Narcissa finally had her moment to pick out the best outfit for Lyra. \u201cSo, what have you been thinking?\u201d she asked Lyra who was standing there looking rather bored.</p><p>She shrugged, \u201cI\u2019m sure whatever you pick will be nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave a look around,\u201d she urged, \u201cTry something.\u201d</p><p>Lyra could tell her aunt was desperate to try and bond with the girl as she had tried several times before. It wasn\u2019t that Lyra didn\u2019t care about her looks, she did, but she just knew that whatever she\u2019d pick would be wrong. She stepped forward and browsed the racks before pulling out a modest black dress that was high cut, with long sleeves and showed off a bit of her legs. \u201cHow about this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you shouldn\u2019t wear black, my dear,\u201d Narcissa said, taking the dress from her niece and putting it back, \u201cYour mother would wear black all the time, it\u2019s a very dominating colour, would leave the wrong impression.\u201d</p><p>Lyra sucked in her lips spotted a red dress with black lace detailing, she pulled it out and looked at it.</p><p>\u201cToo short,\u201d her aunt said, \u201cRed is also a bit aggressive, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Lyra said, shoving the dress back into place.</p><p>She gravitated towards a green velvet wrap dress. \u201cGreat colour and style but velvet is a bit 70\u2019s,\u201d Narcissa said.</p><p>\u201cHow about you pick something out for me?\u201d Lyra said.</p><p>Her aunt nodded and pulled out a white and black polka dot chiffon dress with lace accents, \u201cHow about this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt looks a bit like a sack,\u201d Lyra said.</p><p>\u201cTrust me, it doesn\u2019t look like a sack when it\u2019s on,\u201d Narcissa insisted.</p><p>Lyra reached out and put the dress on, \u201cHuh. It\u2019s actually not too bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cModest and feminine,\u201d Narcissa said, \u201cIt does have a bit of your personality too. I think it\u2019s good. Now shoes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t just wear boots with it?\u201d Lyra asked.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous,\u201d Narcissa said in heightened tone with a dismissive hand wave. She looked around the set of shoes she had before settling for a white pair with a black base, \u201cThese.\u201d</p><p>Lyra took them and slipped them on.</p><p>\u201cOh look at you, Lyra,\u201d Narcissa said, \u201cYou look gorgeous.\u201d</p><p>Lyra looked at herself in the mirror and span around. She did look gorgeous but she didn\u2019t feel like it was here. </p><p>\u201cNow makeup,\u201d her aunt said, drawing her wand.</p><p>Lyra allowed her aunt to go a bit overboard with her makeup but when she looked at the final product she was impressed. Her lips were painted with a nude lipstick and she had a bright base with dreamy eyes that didn\u2019t look too different from her without makeup. She smiled at the sight of herself.</p><p>\u201cI look great,\u201d Lyra said, \u201cThank you, Aunty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re gorgeous,\u201d she said, \u201cMuch prettier than your mother was at your age.\u201d</p><p>Lyra laughed, \u201cYou can\u2019t say that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can because she\u2019s my sister,\u201d Narcissa said, \u201cStill no suitors?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not interested.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you are good at your work and I can accept it if you want to be single for the rest of your life and just work on your research but Lucius told me that there may be something going on with Severus.\u201d</p><p>Lyra had let her guard down a bit too much over the short time with her aunt and her face fell slightly at the mention of Severus, \u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLyra,\u201d Narcissa said, pulling her niece\u2019s hands into hers and looking deep into her eyes. \u201cYou have a duty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve all had to make sacrifices, my dear,\u201d she said squeezing her hands.</p><p>\u201cUncle told me about you two,\u201d Lyra said, \u201cDo you regret it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I was young I did,\u201d Narcissa said, her face softening as she spoke. \u201cIt took me years to get over the relationship I had before him but Lucius respected that. He gave me distance, flowered me with gifts and eventually I fell in love with him and then we had Draco. You\u2019ll learn to adapt to the situation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat made you fall in love with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis kindness, I saw him playing with you when I was babysitting you one afternoon,\u201d she reminisced, \u201cHe was teaching you the piano, he had you propped up on his knee and you were following along. I knew he\u2019d be a great father, although his affection wasn\u2019t as great as it was towards Draco as it was to you.\u201d</p><p>Lyra nodded.</p><p>\u201cIt took time but I do love him,\u201d she said, \u201cYou too will learn to love whomever you marry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMum mentioned Barty Crouch Junior as a potential spouse when I visited,\u201d Lyra said. </p><p>\u201cI would prefer if you didn\u2019t marry a Death Eater,\u201d she replied, \u201cIt caused too much trouble in our relationship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYet you suggested Carrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere aren\u2019t many of the Sacred 28 left to choose from,\u201d Narcissa said.</p><p>A knock on the door was heard, preventing Lyra from dropping a snarky comment. Narcissa flicked her wand towards the door, opening it and revealing her husband.</p><p>\u201cMy two favourite ladies,\u201d he said.</p><p>Narcissa went to greet him with a chaste kiss on the lips and Lyra gave him a brief hug.</p><p>\u201cYou look beautiful, Lyra,\u201d he said, tucking her hair behind her ear and resting a hand on her shoulder. \u201cWe best be off, don\u2019t want to keep the Wizengamot waiting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you not coming, Aunty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I can\u2019t take Draco,\u201d she said, \u201cHe\u2019s too young.\u201d</p><p>Lyra frowned but nodded. </p><p>\u201cNo one from school wanted to come?\u201d Lucius enquired, \u201cSeverus? Or your other colleagues who helped?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, \u201cNo, it was a bit last minute to be honest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not every day a former student receives an Order of Merlin,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019m surprised.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d she shrugged, \u201cI don\u2019t like the attention, anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, there\u2019s sure to be a lot of press,\u201d he said, \u201cBut don\u2019t worry. I had a special chat to Rita Skeeter about the bullshit she\u2019s been writing about you lately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI appreciate it,\u201d Lyra replied, \u201cHopefully today goes without a hitch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, there\u2019ll be a problem if you\u2019re late. Go,\u201d she insisted waving the pair of them away.</p><p>Lucius\u2019 hand rested on her upper back and gently guided out of the room. \u201cWe\u2019ll be using the floo network,\u201d he said.</p><p>She nodded and lead the way down the stairs, through the foyer and into the living room. She stepped into the fireplace after grabbing a handful of floo powder. She sprinkled the powder around her, the green flames starting to lick at her. \u201cMinistry of Magic, Atrium,\u201d she said clearly before being sucked into the fireplace.</p><p>Gracefully, she stepped out of the gilded fireplace and onto the dark hard wood floor of the Atrium. She walked forward a few steps and found herself hounded by a group of reporters. There were bright flashes from a camera, Lyra closing her eyes and wincing away, shocked by the assault. Each reporter was talking over the other and Lyra couldn\u2019t process anything that was being said. </p><p>She felt a hand press lightly on her shoulder, drawing her attention away from the journalists and up to her Uncle. He gave the girl a firm squeeze to reassure her and smiled. A small smirk played across Lyra\u2019s face as she realised the role her Uncle wanted her to play. She was dressed the part of the innocent and demure niece of the wealthy, well-established businessman and she knew what she had to do.</p><p>He looked back at the crowd and affectionately pulled Lyra closer to him, \u201cOne at a time,\u201d he said, \u201cMy dear niece isn\u2019t used to all the attention. We\u2019ll take a few questions before we head off to the ceremony.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiss Lestrange,\u201d a man addressed the young witch, \u201cHow does it feel to be the youngest and one of the few witches to be awarded an Order of Merlin?\u201d</p><p>She smiled, \u201cHonestly, I am honoured and I am so touched to have my work acknowledged to this degree. I never expected to achieve one in my lifetime so it does come as a bit of a surprise to me but I\u2019m just glad my research healed and saved the lives of so many people. I hope that in my receiving of this award I can inspire other young witches and wizards to pursue excellence and work towards a better world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiss Lestrange, how do your parents feel about this?\u201d</p><p>Lyra allowed her face to flicker with a brief look of sadness, \u201cI have very little contact with my biological parents but I am so glad to have my Uncle Lucius by my side as he raised me to be the witch I am today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNarcissa and I are so proud of her work,\u201d Lucius said, giving her an affectionate squeeze, \u201cWe are so glad that despite her parentage that Lyra has turned out to be such a beautiful and intelligent witch.\u201d</p><p>She looked up at her Uncle and smiled, \u201cI consider this man to be my father.\u201d Although she did believe the words she was saying to a degree, she couldn\u2019t help but feel a slight pain in her chest as her thoughts flicked over to the recent memory of her parents in prison.</p><p>\u201cAnd what do you think Emily Wiltshire would have to say about your Order of Merlin, Lyra?\u201d</p><p>That voice. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to regret this, Lyra.\u201d </p><p>It matched the howler she had received.</p><p>The crowd parted slightly and revealed the owner of the voice who spoke out.</p><p>Jack Thompson.</p>",

When Lyra Lestrange\u2019s old headmaster offers her a position as Defence Against the Dark Arts Teacher she finds herself thrown into an adventure involving a secret affair with a colleague, discovering the cure for a disease and dealing with students cursing themselves. Who knew that being a Hogwarts Professor was such a rollercoaster?</i></p><p><i>Set in the school year of 1990-1991 with the prospect of a sequel, or two, on the horizon.</i></p><p><b><i>Rated: E for graphic sex scenes in later chapters.

Not only did Lyra receive a letter but she found herself the topic on the front page of the The Daily Prophet once more.</p><p><i>LYRA LESTRANGE TO BE YOUNGEST ORDER OF MERLIN RECIPIENT IN HISTORY</i></p><p><i>Written By Rita Skeeter</i></p><p><i>The name Lyra Lestrange dominated headlines last month as she produced a cure to Psyrot, a disease that had been plaguing the Wizarding community for several months. As a result of her contributions to the Healing Arts, Lyra Lestrange finds herself once again thrust into the spotlight as she becomes the youngest ever witch to receive an Order of Merlin.</i></p>[[MORE]]<p><i>\u201cThere is no doubt in my mind that Lyra Lestrange is worthy of this award,\u201d says Minister of Magic, Cornelius Fudge, \u201cHer discovery has saved numerous lives and she deserves to be recognised for her achievements. She is an inspiration to us all, I hope she will continue her work as a healer and that this award will inspire her, along with other witches and wizards of talent, to push boundaries and enlighten our community.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Despite the support of our Minister, there are still some doubt among the public as to whether Lyra should be a recipient of this prestigious award.</i></p><p><i>\u201cIt\u2019s an absolute disgrace that Lyra is being awarded an OM,\u201d says a disgruntled former colleague and classmate of Lestrange, \u201cGiven her history, I don\u2019t believe she deserves one. She almost killed one of our classmates.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Should we be giving an almost killer and Death Eater sympathiser an award reserved for outstanding citizens?</i></p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why I subscribe to this bloody paper,\u201d Minerva said, throwing her copy onto the table with a large thud. \u201cIt\u2019s all codswallop, that Skeeter woman, I have half a mind- No, I tell you, I am writing her a letter.\u201d</p><p>Lyra laughed, \u201cIt\u2019s fine, Minerva.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like it\u2019s a lie,\u201d Lyra shrugged, \u201cI did do those things they mentioned in the last article, you know it, half the students know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re not that person anymore,\u201d Minerva argued, \u201cYou saved people and that bloody well deserves to be recognised, Lyra.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeople know,\u201d she shrugged, \u201cThat\u2019s enough. They\u2019ll believe what they want to and that\u2019s fine by me.\u201d</p><p>The Transfiguration Professor paused for a moment, slightly perplexed by the maturity her ex-student was showing. She pursed her lips before insisting, \u201cWell, if anyone else gives you grief, you send them straight to me.\u201d</p><p>With a laugh and a nod Lyra left the breakfast table and headed off to her classes. The day progressed rather quickly and with ease, Lyra utilising her free periods to mark assignments and plan her lessons. She found that her students were still in rather high spirits, none seeming to be affected by the reminder that their Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher may be a Death Eater. She did find that a few of them took the time to congratulate her on her nomination for the Order of Merlin. Once her classes were finished, Lyra found herself back in the company of Severus within his office.</p><p>\u201cNow don\u2019t think that just because it was your birthday yesterday and you\u2019re an Order of Merlin nominee that I\u2019ll go easy on you,\u201d Severus warned. His wand was drawn and he had adopted an aggressive dueling stance.</p><p>Lyra acted cool, a smirk formed across her lips, \u201cI would expect you to go harder on me, if anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDraw your wand,\u201d he urged.</p><p>Lyra\u2019s eyes narrowed, her smirk gone. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cToday we practice with the Cruciatus Curse,\u201d he replied, a grim expression firm on his face.</p><p>Lyra breathed in deep, reaching for her wand and twirling it in between her fingers. She closed her eyes and cleared her head before looking him in the eyes.</p><p>\u201cBelieve me when I say that I take no pleasure in this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s necessary,\u201d she replied, \u201cGet on with it.\u201d</p><p>He relaxed his stance a bit, reluctant to start, \u201cLyra, if it\u2019s too much tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have my wand, I know how to use it,\u201d she said, \u201cIt\u2019ll be fine, Severus.\u201d</p><p>He nodded once, firmly, before returning to his position. \u201cCrucio!\u201d he casted.</p><p>A small scream of surprise erupted from Lyra\u2019s throat, she gripped her wand tighter and her face was twisted in pain as the curse weakly burned her insides. \u201cCome on, Sevvy,\u201d she taunted, \u201cIs that all you\u2019ve got?\u201d</p><p>He gritted his teeth in displeasure, \u201cCrucio!\u201d</p><p>Lyra fell to her knees that time, her lips pressed tightly to stop herself from screaming. The curse was more intense, her bones felt as though they were on fire, her head had a piercing ache and her flesh felt as though it was being cut and ripped open.</p><p>It barely lasted a minute before Severus ended the curse but every second of being it it felt like it would drag on forever. He looked into Lyra\u2019s eyes and cast, \u201cLegilimens!\u201d</p><p>Her mind was blank, completely and utterly blank. It was almost as though he had stepped into a void. He released her and there was this smug look on her face, knowing she had achieved it on her first try.</p><p>Severus wouldn\u2019t let his lesson end that quickly, \u201cCrucio!\u201d</p><p>Another small scream escaped her but she quickly quietened herself. Her wand fell from her hands and she held herself, wrapping her arms around her body and her hands tightly squeezed her biceps. The curse ended and she looked up at him.</p><p>\u201cLegilimens!\u201d</p><p>Nothing once more.</p><p>Severus was annoyed, when he had practiced with Dumbledore it had taken him several days before he had mastered it. Now Lyra was there kneeling before him, easily detached from her emotions and memories. He was tempted to see how much it would take her to break, a sadistic side unwinding inside himself.</p><p>No.</p><p>What was he thinking? He loved Lyra, he didn\u2019t want to hurt her.</p><p>She stood up, steadying herself on the desk. She leaned back and twirled her wand between her fingers like a drummer would with their stick. \u201cIs that it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I just out of practice or are you somehow immune to the Cruciatus Curse?\u201d</p><p>She laughed, \u201cIt did feel rather weak in comparison to my mother\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what it\u2019s like to be on the other end from your mother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was regularly used as a disciplinary method both at home and at Durmstrang,\u201d she replied, \u201cAlthough, it was a bit under wraps at Durmstrang. It used either for really bad kids or to encourage the Quidditch players to play better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought things were bad at my house,\u201d he said, \u201cMy father used to belt me. Sometimes he\u2019d make me kneel and balance a book on my head all night long.\u201d</p><p>Lyra stopped twirling her wand and instead looked concerned. \u201cPretty sure that\u2019s more fucked up than the Cruciatus Curse,\u201d Lyra said, \u201cAt least it\u2019s over in an instant. I learned very quickly not to cry and scream because it would just make it worse, maybe that\u2019s why I can be so detached from my emotions. But yeah, your parents punishment sounds really fucked up, Sev.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged.</p><p>\u201cAre you ok?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d he replied, \u201cSo practicing your Occlumency after enduring the Cruciatus Curse seems pretty redundant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably,\u201d she laughed sheepishly, \u201cI mean, occlumency feels pretty second nature to me now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow would you stand up to seeing someone else tortured?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she sighed and tried to imagine it. \u201cI guess it\u2019d depend on who it was, I don\u2019t think I could stomach Draco being tortured, but I think I could keep my emotions in check.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t get too emotional?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps,\u201d she said, \u201cI\u2019ll try my best not to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour best may not be good enough,\u201d he said, \u201cWhat if it was me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSev-\u201d</p><p>\u201cLyra, you\u2019re risking my life and yours if you can\u2019t close your mind,\u201d he said, \u201cI don\u2019t want your best, I want you to do it.\u201d</p><p>She gritted her teeth and nodded, \u201cI understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUse the curse on me,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she was shocked by the request.</p><p>\u201cUse the Cruciatus on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, firmly.</p><p>\u201cWould you refuse if the Dark Lord asked you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I wouldn\u2019t,\u201d she said, \u201cBut the Dark Lord isn\u2019t asking me, you\u2019re asking me to practice on you. I know how the curse works, I can do it if I need-\u201d</p><p>\u201cProve it,\u201d he spat.</p><p>\u201cSev,\u201d she said once more.</p><p>\u201cLyra,\u201d he said sternly, \u201cI\u2019m losing my patience.\u201d</p><p>Hesitantly, Lyra positioned herself in an aggressive stance. \u201cCrucio.\u201d</p><p>A scream ripped from Severus\u2019 throat as he felt pain tear through his body. He dropped to his knees and began to writhe from the burning sensation that coursed through his veins. He clutched onto his head as a sharp pain buried itself into his brain.</p><p>Lyra found no enjoyment in casting the Cruciatus Curse but the intent was there. Her mind was completely detached from her emotions and she allowed herself to watch Severus screaming in pain for several minutes before ending the curse.</p><p>He steadied himself on the table and looked into Lyra\u2019s eyes. There was no remorse, no feeling on the surface that he could easily pluck from her mind. She felt nothing. He watched her close eyes and when she opened them once more it was almost as though the warmth of her personality had returned.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re terrifying,\u201d he said.</p><p>She scratched the back of her head, \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she sighed deeply before continuing. \u201cI spent a long time not feeling, Sev. I wasn\u2019t allowed to show weakness around my parents. I guess it\u2019s second nature to me to just be distant from my feelings. It took a long time to learn how to be\u2026 normal, I guess?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose I chose the right person to fall in love with,\u201d he said.</p><p>She laughed, \u201cI suppose you did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I think that\u2019s it for our lessons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I tortured you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, shaking his head. \u201cLyra, I trust you and I trust you will keep our relationship hidden from the Dark Lord but don\u2019t think that means I won\u2019t test you from time to time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t expect anything less,\u201d she smirked.</p><p>~</p><p>The week seemed to drag on in anticipation of Lyra\u2019s Order of Merlin ceremony. Each day there was a new article about her, one where Albus himself vouched for her then another where Lucius spoke. Things died down after her Uncle gave his take on the story, calling it \u201cutter nonsense\u201d and detailing how he and his wife \u201cguided Lyra back onto the straight and narrow, nurturing her natural talents\u201d. </p><p>The articles were enough to spark doubt in her mind. She began to question the true motivation for the award and who in fact nominated her. She tried to convince herself it didn\u2019t matter but with both Albus and Lucius\u2019 names in the press, she was beginning to suspect them. Either way, her award would cast a brilliant light on both of them and Lyra felt as though her nomination was somehow tainted.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going,\u201d she announced as she entered Severus\u2019 office, slumping herself into a chair. Her arms were folded and her eyes tightly closed, almost like a child.</p><p>It was the night before the ceremony and Lyra had found herself seeking comfort with the man she loved and who had refused to attend the ceremony with her.</p><p>\u201cAnd why are you protesting now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not coming,\u201d she huffed.</p><p>His eyebrows arose in boredom, \u201cWe discussed this days ago, you know why I can\u2019t. Lucius will suspect that we\u2019re in a relationship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one else can come either, it\u2019s just going to be me and Lucius,\u201d Lyra groaned, \u201cI doubt this nomination is even genuine at this point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat on earth do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cObviously it\u2019s some ploy by Lucius to better the Malfoy name,\u201d she said, \u201cLook at the way he spoke about me in the papers.\u201d She put on a voice, \u201c\u2018Oh, this poor orphaned child who was misguided and on the path to the Dark Arts was set straight by me and now she\u2019s a brilliant witch who betters the country\u2019. Absolute bollocks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sound ridiculous,\u201d he said, \u201cDo you really think Lucius would pay the Minister off so you could get an Order of Merlin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t put it past him,\u201d she said, \u201cIt\u2019s either him or Albus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlbus?\u201d he questioned her logic, \u201cAnd what motivation does Albus have?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, he\u2019s obviously not happy that we\u2019re together and if I get the OM all my offers will flood back and bam, I\u2019m gone. He\u2019s also concerned that the Defence Against the Dark Arts curse will nab me somehow and he doesn\u2019t want to wait for it to happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re delusional.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I?\u201d she asked, \u201cIt\u2019s obviously rigged to make me look better and in turn all these wizards benefit off of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did it, you idiot.\u201d</p><p>Lyra wasn\u2019t expecting that answer. She pulled a face, her eyebrows were pressed together as her mind ticked over the words. \u201cWhat?\u201d she asked in disbelief.</p><p>\u201cI nominated you,\u201d he said, emphasising each syllable.</p><p>Her confused expression only worsened, her eyes narrowed and cheeks puffed up. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019ve seen your work and you deserve it,\u201d he said. \u201cYou discovered the cure for a disease within two months. I watched you agonise over every moment, I watched you utilise all the tools you had at your disposal and I saw your brilliant mind at work. You deserve to be recognised for that and you shouldn\u2019t be wasting your time as a teacher or in an office, you should be out there doing real work to benefit the community.\u201d</p><p>Lyra felt uncomfortable with her emotions that were brewing inside her. Yet again, her lover had complimented her and given her approval but this time she didn\u2019t cry. She just sat in her stunned silence.</p><p>He chuckled as he approached her, leaning down to lay a kiss on the top of her head. \u201cI love you, Lyra,\u201d he said.</p><p>She exhaled a small laugh and looked up at him, \u201cI love you too. Are you sure you can\u2019t come?\u201d</p><p>He frowned slightly, \u201cI\u2019m afraid not. I would have loved to share that moment with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s ok,\u201d she said, \u201cI\u2019ll be there when you get yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what will mine be in?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYour bravery,\u201d she said vaguely.</p><p>\u201cMy bravery?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm,\u201d she hummed, \u201cOr your brilliant mind. You could rewrite all our textbooks and bring us into the 21st century. Either that or you\u2019ll help me cure more diseases. I was thinking lycanthropy would be cool.\u201d</p><p>He laughed at her ambition, \u201cPossibly.\u201d</p><p>She smiled at him and as she did she found her mind wandering to imagine a future with him. One, where they would live together and spend their time in solitude; researching, cooking and sleeping together. Lyra felt an intrusion of her thoughts and quickly shut those feelings out.</p><p>Severus smiled sadly at her, \u201cSeems too good to be true. Don\u2019t get too complacent with your Occlumency.\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>~</p><p>The pair spent the night together, as they usually did. Lyra found herself waking up early the next morning, not wanting to get out of bed. She groaned and pulled Severus closer to her.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, my love,\u201d he muttered, \u201cTime for you to go yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to,\u201d she said, her voice muffled from being buried against his back.</p><p>He chuckled and rolled over, wrapping his arm around her and Lyra finding her head resting on his chest. His fingers danced gently on her back, his eyes still shut slightly. \u201cYour family are waiting for you,\u201d he said, Lyra listening to the rumble of his voice through his chest.</p><p>She hummed, \u201cMm, but you\u2019re so sexy when you wake up.\u201d Her hands gliding down towards his free cock.</p><p>\u201cLyra,\u201d he groaned as she wrapped her hand around it and began to lightly tease it. </p><p>\u201cSev,\u201d she mocked as she let go and slid down under the sheets.</p><p>He moaned in bliss as he felt her tongue lick up the length of his cock a few times before she took it into her mouth. She sucked and teased the firm member with her mouth, parting from it a few times to rub him. She looked up at him, watching his eyes closed in pleasure and appreciating how his body looked in the morning light.</p><p>Lyra would continue to alternate between sucking and rubbing, enjoying the sight and sound of him slowly unravelling beneath her. His moans were enchanting, stirring heat in the depth of her stomach. She smirked as he fisted the sheets, attempting to restrain himself from coming quickly down her throat.</p><p>\u201cMy love,\u201d he choked out, \u201cRide me.\u201d</p><p>She obliged, easily straddling him and allowing the length of his cock to slowly be engulfed by the warm wet heart that she hid between her legs. Severus held her hips as he bucked up into them, Lyra merely enjoying the ride. </p><p>His eyes were open now, watching the way her body moved on top of him. His eyes would glance down to watch his dick slowly enter in and out of her. It was taking all his self restraint not flip her over and fuck her silly into the mattress.</p><p>He watched her as her hands found their way to stimulate herself, one hand tugging a nipple and the other firm on her clit. He felt her walls tighten around him as she overstimulated herself. His eyes would alternate between the filthy things she was doing to get herself off and to her face; how beautiful she looked with her eyes closed and her bottom lip sucked in, her teeth biting down yet failing to withhold the moans that escaped her throat.</p><p>Severus couldn\u2019t stand it any longer. He lifted her up and rolled her over to the side, allowing her to fall onto the mattress. He got up and placed himself between her legs, angling down slowly until his member was once again buried deep inside her. </p><p>Lyra moaned at the intrusion. Her eyes closed briefly in pleasure. Her eyes fluttered open once more and watched as he towered over her, thrusting in and out of her, completely driving but lust and greed. It was intoxicating. Her hands pleasured herself and she found herself working closer and closer towards her orgasm. </p><p>He could feel her clenching down hard around him, her breathing became sparse as she held her breath the closer she got to her unraveling. He tried to maintain a steady pace but he could feel his balls tightening as he felt his orgasm near too.</p><p>\u201cCome for me, Lyra,\u201d he whispered, \u201cCome for me, my love.\u201d</p><p>And she did.</p><p>Her hips bucked up into his, a strangled scream escaped her. The look on her face was enough to push him over the edge. He felt her walls pulse as he came inside her. He collapsed on top of her briefly, his skin sticking to hers from the layer of sweat that had accumulated. He rolled to the side and Lyra held his hand.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll shower and I\u2019ll walk you past the anti-apparation barrier,\u201d he said, squeezing her hand.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to come with me?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if I could look Lucius and Narcissa in the eye after shagging their niece,\u201d he said.</p><p>She laughed, \u201cFair call.\u201d</p><p>After a few silent moments together in bed, a tug pulled Lyra out of the bed and towards the bathroom for a shower. They walked side by side through the hallways of Hogwarts, all she wanted was to hold his hand. She gave him a small smile as they reached the Forbidden Forest.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you tonight?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cProvided Cissy and Lucius don\u2019t want you to stay for dinner,\u201d he said.</p><p>She pursed her lips and nodded. Severus reached down to gently caress her face, leaning forward he left a kiss on her forehead. \u201cI\u2019ll see you soon, my love,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d she replied before stepping back slightly and turning on the spot.</p><p>Lyra mentally braced herself at the sight of the Manor. With a deep breath in and slow exhale, she found the nerve to walk down the all too familiar path and back into her family home. She let herself in, hanging her coat on the hanger near the door.</p><p>\u201cOh Lyra,\u201d Narcissa said, darting down the stairs. \u201cHow good to see you again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMorning, Aunty,\u201d she replied, embracing her aunt.</p><p>\u201cCome,\u201d Narcissa said, \u201cWe\u2019ve got to get you looking good and presentable.\u201d</p><p>Narcissa whisked her niece away, taking her back up the stairs and to her and Lucius\u2019 wing of the house. Right next to their shared room was Narcissa\u2019s own personal wardrobe, if one could call it that. It was a room, lined with the latest and greatest fashion. Coats with rich furs and dresses of different colours and fabrics hung back to back, all organised by designer of course. Sitting in the centre was an open set of drawers with boots and heels, along with some handbags.</p><p>Lyra looked indifferent, having seen this all before. Narcissa loved to play fancy dress up with her niece, particularly when she came of age. She would beg to dress her and take her along to fancy balls and tea parties that the pure bloods would hold but Lyra refused.</p><p>Now, Narcissa finally had her moment to pick out the best outfit for Lyra. \u201cSo, what have you been thinking?\u201d she asked Lyra who was standing there looking rather bored.</p><p>She shrugged, \u201cI\u2019m sure whatever you pick will be nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave a look around,\u201d she urged, \u201cTry something.\u201d</p><p>Lyra could tell her aunt was desperate to try and bond with the girl as she had tried several times before. It wasn\u2019t that Lyra didn\u2019t care about her looks, she did, but she just knew that whatever she\u2019d pick would be wrong. She stepped forward and browsed the racks before pulling out a modest black dress that was high cut, with long sleeves and showed off a bit of her legs. \u201cHow about this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you shouldn\u2019t wear black, my dear,\u201d Narcissa said, taking the dress from her niece and putting it back, \u201cYour mother would wear black all the time, it\u2019s a very dominating colour, would leave the wrong impression.\u201d</p><p>Lyra sucked in her lips spotted a red dress with black lace detailing, she pulled it out and looked at it.</p><p>\u201cToo short,\u201d her aunt said, \u201cRed is also a bit aggressive, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Lyra said, shoving the dress back into place.</p><p>She gravitated towards a green velvet wrap dress. \u201cGreat colour and style but velvet is a bit 70\u2019s,\u201d Narcissa said.</p><p>\u201cHow about you pick something out for me?\u201d Lyra said.</p><p>Her aunt nodded and pulled out a white and black polka dot chiffon dress with lace accents, \u201cHow about this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt looks a bit like a sack,\u201d Lyra said.</p><p>\u201cTrust me, it doesn\u2019t look like a sack when it\u2019s on,\u201d Narcissa insisted.</p><p>Lyra reached out and put the dress on, \u201cHuh. It\u2019s actually not too bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cModest and feminine,\u201d Narcissa said, \u201cIt does have a bit of your personality too. I think it\u2019s good. Now shoes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t just wear boots with it?\u201d Lyra asked.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous,\u201d Narcissa said in heightened tone with a dismissive hand wave. She looked around the set of shoes she had before settling for a white pair with a black base, \u201cThese.\u201d</p><p>Lyra took them and slipped them on.</p><p>\u201cOh look at you, Lyra,\u201d Narcissa said, \u201cYou look gorgeous.\u201d</p><p>Lyra looked at herself in the mirror and span around. She did look gorgeous but she didn\u2019t feel like it was here. </p><p>\u201cNow makeup,\u201d her aunt said, drawing her wand.</p><p>Lyra allowed her aunt to go a bit overboard with her makeup but when she looked at the final product she was impressed. Her lips were painted with a nude lipstick and she had a bright base with dreamy eyes that didn\u2019t look too different from her without makeup. She smiled at the sight of herself.</p><p>\u201cI look great,\u201d Lyra said, \u201cThank you, Aunty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re gorgeous,\u201d she said, \u201cMuch prettier than your mother was at your age.\u201d</p><p>Lyra laughed, \u201cYou can\u2019t say that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can because she\u2019s my sister,\u201d Narcissa said, \u201cStill no suitors?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not interested.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you are good at your work and I can accept it if you want to be single for the rest of your life and just work on your research but Lucius told me that there may be something going on with Severus.\u201d</p><p>Lyra had let her guard down a bit too much over the short time with her aunt and her face fell slightly at the mention of Severus, \u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLyra,\u201d Narcissa said, pulling her niece\u2019s hands into hers and looking deep into her eyes. \u201cYou have a duty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve all had to make sacrifices, my dear,\u201d she said squeezing her hands.</p><p>\u201cUncle told me about you two,\u201d Lyra said, \u201cDo you regret it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I was young I did,\u201d Narcissa said, her face softening as she spoke. \u201cIt took me years to get over the relationship I had before him but Lucius respected that. He gave me distance, flowered me with gifts and eventually I fell in love with him and then we had Draco. You\u2019ll learn to adapt to the situation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat made you fall in love with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis kindness, I saw him playing with you when I was babysitting you one afternoon,\u201d she reminisced, \u201cHe was teaching you the piano, he had you propped up on his knee and you were following along. I knew he\u2019d be a great father, although his affection wasn\u2019t as great as it was towards Draco as it was to you.\u201d</p><p>Lyra nodded.</p><p>\u201cIt took time but I do love him,\u201d she said, \u201cYou too will learn to love whomever you marry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMum mentioned Barty Crouch Junior as a potential spouse when I visited,\u201d Lyra said. </p><p>\u201cI would prefer if you didn\u2019t marry a Death Eater,\u201d she replied, \u201cIt caused too much trouble in our relationship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYet you suggested Carrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere aren\u2019t many of the Sacred 28 left to choose from,\u201d Narcissa said.</p><p>A knock on the door was heard, preventing Lyra from dropping a snarky comment. Narcissa flicked her wand towards the door, opening it and revealing her husband.</p><p>\u201cMy two favourite ladies,\u201d he said.</p><p>Narcissa went to greet him with a chaste kiss on the lips and Lyra gave him a brief hug.</p><p>\u201cYou look beautiful, Lyra,\u201d he said, tucking her hair behind her ear and resting a hand on her shoulder. \u201cWe best be off, don\u2019t want to keep the Wizengamot waiting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you not coming, Aunty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I can\u2019t take Draco,\u201d she said, \u201cHe\u2019s too young.\u201d</p><p>Lyra frowned but nodded. </p><p>\u201cNo one from school wanted to come?\u201d Lucius enquired, \u201cSeverus? Or your other colleagues who helped?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, \u201cNo, it was a bit last minute to be honest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not every day a former student receives an Order of Merlin,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019m surprised.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d she shrugged, \u201cI don\u2019t like the attention, anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, there\u2019s sure to be a lot of press,\u201d he said, \u201cBut don\u2019t worry. I had a special chat to Rita Skeeter about the bullshit she\u2019s been writing about you lately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI appreciate it,\u201d Lyra replied, \u201cHopefully today goes without a hitch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, there\u2019ll be a problem if you\u2019re late. Go,\u201d she insisted waving the pair of them away.</p><p>Lucius\u2019 hand rested on her upper back and gently guided out of the room. \u201cWe\u2019ll be using the floo network,\u201d he said.</p><p>She nodded and lead the way down the stairs, through the foyer and into the living room. She stepped into the fireplace after grabbing a handful of floo powder. She sprinkled the powder around her, the green flames starting to lick at her. \u201cMinistry of Magic, Atrium,\u201d she said clearly before being sucked into the fireplace.</p><p>Gracefully, she stepped out of the gilded fireplace and onto the dark hard wood floor of the Atrium. She walked forward a few steps and found herself hounded by a group of reporters. There were bright flashes from a camera, Lyra closing her eyes and wincing away, shocked by the assault. Each reporter was talking over the other and Lyra couldn\u2019t process anything that was being said. </p><p>She felt a hand press lightly on her shoulder, drawing her attention away from the journalists and up to her Uncle. He gave the girl a firm squeeze to reassure her and smiled. A small smirk played across Lyra\u2019s face as she realised the role her Uncle wanted her to play. She was dressed the part of the innocent and demure niece of the wealthy, well-established businessman and she knew what she had to do.</p><p>He looked back at the crowd and affectionately pulled Lyra closer to him, \u201cOne at a time,\u201d he said, \u201cMy dear niece isn\u2019t used to all the attention. We\u2019ll take a few questions before we head off to the ceremony.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiss Lestrange,\u201d a man addressed the young witch, \u201cHow does it feel to be the youngest and one of the few witches to be awarded an Order of Merlin?\u201d</p><p>She smiled, \u201cHonestly, I am honoured and I am so touched to have my work acknowledged to this degree. I never expected to achieve one in my lifetime so it does come as a bit of a surprise to me but I\u2019m just glad my research healed and saved the lives of so many people. I hope that in my receiving of this award I can inspire other young witches and wizards to pursue excellence and work towards a better world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiss Lestrange, how do your parents feel about this?\u201d</p><p>Lyra allowed her face to flicker with a brief look of sadness, \u201cI have very little contact with my biological parents but I am so glad to have my Uncle Lucius by my side as he raised me to be the witch I am today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNarcissa and I are so proud of her work,\u201d Lucius said, giving her an affectionate squeeze, \u201cWe are so glad that despite her parentage that Lyra has turned out to be such a beautiful and intelligent witch.\u201d</p><p>She looked up at her Uncle and smiled, \u201cI consider this man to be my father.\u201d Although she did believe the words she was saying to a degree, she couldn\u2019t help but feel a slight pain in her chest as her thoughts flicked over to the recent memory of her parents in prison.</p><p>\u201cAnd what do you think Emily Wiltshire would have to say about your Order of Merlin, Lyra?\u201d</p><p>That voice. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to regret this, Lyra.\u201d </p><p>It matched the howler she had received.</p><p>The crowd parted slightly and revealed the owner of the voice who spoke out.</p><p>Jack Thompson.</p>",

When Lyra Lestrange&rsquo;s old headmaster offers her a position as Defence Against the Dark Arts Teacher she finds herself thrown into an adventure involving a secret affair with a colleague, discovering the cure for a disease and dealing with students cursing themselves.

As a result of her contributions to the Healing Arts, Lyra Lestrange finds herself once again thrust into the spotlight as she becomes the youngest ever witch to receive an Order of Merlin.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;There is no doubt in my mind that Lyra Lestrange is worthy of this award,&rdquo; says Minister of Magic, Cornelius Fudge, &ldquo;Her discovery has saved numerous lives and she deserves to be recognised for her achievements. She is an inspiration to us all, I hope she will continue her work as a healer and that this award will inspire her, along with other witches and wizards of talent, to push boundaries and enlighten our community.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Despite the support of our Minister, there are still some doubt among the public as to whether Lyra should be a recipient of this prestigious award.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an absolute disgrace that Lyra is being awarded an OM,&rdquo; says a disgruntled former colleague and classmate of Lestrange, &ldquo;Given her history, I don&rsquo;t believe she deserves one. She almost killed one of our classmates.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Should we be giving an almost killer and Death Eater sympathiser an award reserved for outstanding citizens?</i></p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why I subscribe to this bloody paper,&rdquo; Minerva said, throwing her copy onto the table with a large thud. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all codswallop, that Skeeter woman, I have half a mind- No, I tell you, I am writing her a letter.&rdquo;</p><p>Lyra laughed, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine, Minerva.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not fine.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not like it&rsquo;s a lie,&rdquo; Lyra shrugged, &ldquo;I did do those things they mentioned in the last article, you know it, half the students know it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;re not that person anymore,&rdquo; Minerva argued, &ldquo;You saved people and that bloody well deserves to be recognised, Lyra.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;People know,&rdquo; she shrugged, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s enough. They&rsquo;ll believe what they want to and that&rsquo;s fine by me.&rdquo;</p><p>The Transfiguration Professor paused for a moment, slightly perplexed by the maturity her ex-student was showing. She pursed her lips before insisting, &ldquo;Well, if anyone else gives you grief, you send them straight to me.&rdquo;</p><p>With a laugh and a nod Lyra left the breakfast table and headed off to her classes. The day progressed rather quickly and with ease, Lyra utilising her free periods to mark assignments and plan her lessons. She found that her students were still in rather high spirits, none seeming to be affected by the reminder that their Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher may be a Death Eater. She did find that a few of them took the time to congratulate her on her nomination for the Order of Merlin. Once her classes were finished, Lyra found herself back in the company of Severus within his office.</p><p>&ldquo;Now don&rsquo;t think that just because it was your birthday yesterday and you&rsquo;re an Order of Merlin nominee that I&rsquo;ll go easy on you,&rdquo; Severus warned. His wand was drawn and he had adopted an aggressive dueling stance.</p><p>Lyra acted cool, a smirk formed across her lips, &ldquo;I would expect you to go harder on me, if anything.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Draw your wand,&rdquo; he urged.</p><p>Lyra&rsquo;s eyes narrowed, her smirk gone. &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Today we practice with the Cruciatus Curse,&rdquo; he replied, a grim expression firm on his face.</p><p>Lyra breathed in deep, reaching for her wand and twirling it in between her fingers. She closed her eyes and cleared her head before looking him in the eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;Believe me when I say that I take no pleasure in this.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s necessary,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;Get on with it.&rdquo;</p><p>He relaxed his stance a bit, reluctant to start, &ldquo;Lyra, if it&rsquo;s too much tell me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I have my wand, I know how to use it,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be fine, Severus.&rdquo;</p><p>He nodded once, firmly, before returning to his position. &ldquo;Crucio!&rdquo; he casted.</p><p>A small scream of surprise erupted from Lyra&rsquo;s throat, she gripped her wand tighter and her face was twisted in pain as the curse weakly burned her insides. &ldquo;Come on, Sevvy,&rdquo; she taunted, &ldquo;Is that all you&rsquo;ve got?&rdquo;</p><p>He gritted his teeth in displeasure, &ldquo;Crucio!&rdquo;</p><p>Lyra fell to her knees that time, her lips pressed tightly to stop herself from screaming. The curse was more intense, her bones felt as though they were on fire, her head had a piercing ache and her flesh felt as though it was being cut and ripped open.</p><p>It barely lasted a minute before Severus ended the curse but every second of being it it felt like it would drag on forever. He looked into Lyra&rsquo;s eyes and cast, &ldquo;Legilimens!&rdquo;</p><p>Her mind was blank, completely and utterly blank. It was almost as though he had stepped into a void. He released her and there was this smug look on her face, knowing she had achieved it on her first try.</p><p>Severus wouldn&rsquo;t let his lesson end that quickly, &ldquo;Crucio!&rdquo;</p><p>Another small scream escaped her but she quickly quietened herself. Her wand fell from her hands and she held herself, wrapping her arms around her body and her hands tightly squeezed her biceps. The curse ended and she looked up at him.</p><p>&ldquo;Legilimens!&rdquo;</p><p>Nothing once more.</p><p>Severus was annoyed, when he had practiced with Dumbledore it had taken him several days before he had mastered it. Now Lyra was there kneeling before him, easily detached from her emotions and memories. He was tempted to see how much it would take her to break, a sadistic side unwinding inside himself.</p><p>No.</p><p>What was he thinking? He loved Lyra, he didn&rsquo;t want to hurt her.</p><p>She stood up, steadying herself on the desk. She leaned back and twirled her wand between her fingers like a drummer would with their stick. &ldquo;Is that it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Am I just out of practice or are you somehow immune to the Cruciatus Curse?&rdquo;</p><p>She laughed, &ldquo;It did feel rather weak in comparison to my mother&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You know what it&rsquo;s like to be on the other end from your mother?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It was regularly used as a disciplinary method both at home and at Durmstrang,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;Although, it was a bit under wraps at Durmstrang. It used either for really bad kids or to encourage the Quidditch players to play better.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I thought things were bad at my house,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;My father used to belt me. Sometimes he&rsquo;d make me kneel and balance a book on my head all night long.&rdquo;</p><p>Lyra stopped twirling her wand and instead looked concerned. &ldquo;Pretty sure that&rsquo;s more fucked up than the Cruciatus Curse,&rdquo; Lyra said, &ldquo;At least it&rsquo;s over in an instant. I learned very quickly not to cry and scream because it would just make it worse, maybe that&rsquo;s why I can be so detached from my emotions. But yeah, your parents punishment sounds really fucked up, Sev.&rdquo;</p><p>He shrugged.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you ok?&rdquo; she asked.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;So practicing your Occlumency after enduring the Cruciatus Curse seems pretty redundant.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Probably,&rdquo; she laughed sheepishly, &ldquo;I mean, occlumency feels pretty second nature to me now.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How would you stand up to seeing someone else tortured?&rdquo; he asked.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; she sighed and tried to imagine it. &ldquo;I guess it&rsquo;d depend on who it was, I don&rsquo;t think I could stomach Draco being tortured, but I think I could keep my emotions in check.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t get too emotional?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try my best not to.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Your best may not be good enough,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;What if it was me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sev-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Lyra, you&rsquo;re risking my life and yours if you can&rsquo;t close your mind,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want your best, I want you to do it.&rdquo;</p><p>She gritted her teeth and nodded, &ldquo;I understand.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Use the curse on me,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; she was shocked by the request.</p><p>&ldquo;Use the Cruciatus on me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said, firmly.</p><p>&ldquo;Would you refuse if the Dark Lord asked you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, I wouldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;But the Dark Lord isn&rsquo;t asking me, you&rsquo;re asking me to practice on you. I know how the curse works, I can do it if I need-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Prove it,&rdquo; he spat.</p><p>&ldquo;Sev,&rdquo; she said once more.</p><p>&ldquo;Lyra,&rdquo; he said sternly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m losing my patience.&rdquo;</p><p>Hesitantly, Lyra positioned herself in an aggressive stance. &ldquo;Crucio.&rdquo;</p><p>A scream ripped from Severus&rsquo; throat as he felt pain tear through his body. He dropped to his knees and began to writhe from the burning sensation that coursed through his veins. He clutched onto his head as a sharp pain buried itself into his brain.</p><p>Lyra found no enjoyment in casting the Cruciatus Curse but the intent was there. Her mind was completely detached from her emotions and she allowed herself to watch Severus screaming in pain for several minutes before ending the curse.</p><p>He steadied himself on the table and looked into Lyra&rsquo;s eyes. There was no remorse, no feeling on the surface that he could easily pluck from her mind. She felt nothing. He watched her close eyes and when she opened them once more it was almost as though the warmth of her personality had returned.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re terrifying,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>She scratched the back of her head, &ldquo;I know.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How do you do that?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; she sighed deeply before continuing. &ldquo;I spent a long time not feeling, Sev. I wasn&rsquo;t allowed to show weakness around my parents. I guess it&rsquo;s second nature to me to just be distant from my feelings. It took a long time to learn how to be&hellip; normal, I guess?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I suppose I chose the right person to fall in love with,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>She laughed, &ldquo;I suppose you did.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I think that&rsquo;s it for our lessons.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Because I tortured you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, shaking his head. &ldquo;Lyra, I trust you and I trust you will keep our relationship hidden from the Dark Lord but don&rsquo;t think that means I won&rsquo;t test you from time to time.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t expect anything less,&rdquo; she smirked.</p><p>~</p><p>The week seemed to drag on in anticipation of Lyra&rsquo;s Order of Merlin ceremony. Each day there was a new article about her, one where Albus himself vouched for her then another where Lucius spoke. Things died down after her Uncle gave his take on the story, calling it &ldquo;utter nonsense&rdquo; and detailing how he and his wife &ldquo;guided Lyra back onto the straight and narrow, nurturing her natural talents&rdquo;. </p><p>The articles were enough to spark doubt in her mind. She began to question the true motivation for the award and who in fact nominated her. She tried to convince herself it didn&rsquo;t matter but with both Albus and Lucius&rsquo; names in the press, she was beginning to suspect them. Either way, her award would cast a brilliant light on both of them and Lyra felt as though her nomination was somehow tainted.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going,&rdquo; she announced as she entered Severus&rsquo; office, slumping herself into a chair. Her arms were folded and her eyes tightly closed, almost like a child.</p><p>It was the night before the ceremony and Lyra had found herself seeking comfort with the man she loved and who had refused to attend the ceremony with her.</p><p>&ldquo;And why are you protesting now?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not coming,&rdquo; she huffed.</p><p>His eyebrows arose in boredom, &ldquo;We discussed this days ago, you know why I can&rsquo;t. Lucius will suspect that we&rsquo;re in a relationship.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No one else can come either, it&rsquo;s just going to be me and Lucius,&rdquo; Lyra groaned, &ldquo;I doubt this nomination is even genuine at this point.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What on earth do you mean?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Obviously it&rsquo;s some ploy by Lucius to better the Malfoy name,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;Look at the way he spoke about me in the papers.&rdquo; She put on a voice, &ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, this poor orphaned child who was misguided and on the path to the Dark Arts was set straight by me and now she&rsquo;s a brilliant witch who betters the country&rsquo;. Absolute bollocks.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You sound ridiculous,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;Do you really think Lucius would pay the Minister off so you could get an Order of Merlin.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t put it past him,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s either him or Albus.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Albus?&rdquo; he questioned her logic, &ldquo;And what motivation does Albus have?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, he&rsquo;s obviously not happy that we&rsquo;re together and if I get the OM all my offers will flood back and bam, I&rsquo;m gone. He&rsquo;s also concerned that the Defence Against the Dark Arts curse will nab me somehow and he doesn&rsquo;t want to wait for it to happen.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re delusional.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Am I?&rdquo; she asked, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s obviously rigged to make me look better and in turn all these wizards benefit off of it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I did it, you idiot.&rdquo;</p><p>Lyra wasn&rsquo;t expecting that answer. She pulled a face, her eyebrows were pressed together as her mind ticked over the words. &ldquo;What?&rdquo; she asked in disbelief.</p><p>&ldquo;I nominated you,&rdquo; he said, emphasising each syllable.</p><p>Her confused expression only worsened, her eyes narrowed and cheeks puffed up. &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Because I&rsquo;ve seen your work and you deserve it,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You discovered the cure for a disease within two months. I watched you agonise over every moment, I watched you utilise all the tools you had at your disposal and I saw your brilliant mind at work. You deserve to be recognised for that and you shouldn&rsquo;t be wasting your time as a teacher or in an office, you should be out there doing real work to benefit the community.&rdquo;</p><p>Lyra felt uncomfortable with her emotions that were brewing inside her. Yet again, her lover had complimented her and given her approval but this time she didn&rsquo;t cry. She just sat in her stunned silence.</p><p>He chuckled as he approached her, leaning down to lay a kiss on the top of her head. &ldquo;I love you, Lyra,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>She exhaled a small laugh and looked up at him, &ldquo;I love you too. Are you sure you can&rsquo;t come?&rdquo;</p><p>He frowned slightly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid not. I would have loved to share that moment with you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s ok,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be there when you get yours.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And what will mine be in?&rdquo; he asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Your bravery,&rdquo; she said vaguely.</p><p>&ldquo;My bravery?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Mmm,&rdquo; she hummed, &ldquo;Or your brilliant mind. You could rewrite all our textbooks and bring us into the 21st century. Either that or you&rsquo;ll help me cure more diseases. I was thinking lycanthropy would be cool.&rdquo;</p><p>He laughed at her ambition, &ldquo;Possibly.&rdquo;</p><p>She smiled at him and as she did she found her mind wandering to imagine a future with him. One, where they would live together and spend their time in solitude; researching, cooking and sleeping together. Lyra felt an intrusion of her thoughts and quickly shut those feelings out.</p><p>Severus smiled sadly at her, &ldquo;Seems too good to be true. Don&rsquo;t get too complacent with your Occlumency.&rdquo;</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>~</p><p>The pair spent the night together, as they usually did. Lyra found herself waking up early the next morning, not wanting to get out of bed. She groaned and pulled Severus closer to her.</p><p>&ldquo;Good morning, my love,&rdquo; he muttered, &ldquo;Time for you to go yet?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to,&rdquo; she said, her voice muffled from being buried against his back.</p><p>He chuckled and rolled over, wrapping his arm around her and Lyra finding her head resting on his chest. His fingers danced gently on her back, his eyes still shut slightly. &ldquo;Your family are waiting for you,&rdquo; he said, Lyra listening to the rumble of his voice through his chest.</p><p>She hummed, &ldquo;Mm, but you&rsquo;re so sexy when you wake up.&rdquo; Her hands gliding down towards his free cock.</p><p>&ldquo;Lyra,&rdquo; he groaned as she wrapped her hand around it and began to lightly tease it. </p><p>&ldquo;Sev,&rdquo; she mocked as she let go and slid down under the sheets.</p><p>He moaned in bliss as he felt her tongue lick up the length of his cock a few times before she took it into her mouth. She sucked and teased the firm member with her mouth, parting from it a few times to rub him. She looked up at him, watching his eyes closed in pleasure and appreciating how his body looked in the morning light.</p><p>Lyra would continue to alternate between sucking and rubbing, enjoying the sight and sound of him slowly unravelling beneath her. His moans were enchanting, stirring heat in the depth of her stomach. She smirked as he fisted the sheets, attempting to restrain himself from coming quickly down her throat.</p><p>&ldquo;My love,&rdquo; he choked out, &ldquo;Ride me.&rdquo;</p><p>She obliged, easily straddling him and allowing the length of his cock to slowly be engulfed by the warm wet heart that she hid between her legs. Severus held her hips as he bucked up into them, Lyra merely enjoying the ride. </p><p>His eyes were open now, watching the way her body moved on top of him. His eyes would glance down to watch his dick slowly enter in and out of her. It was taking all his self restraint not flip her over and fuck her silly into the mattress.</p><p>He watched her as her hands found their way to stimulate herself, one hand tugging a nipple and the other firm on her clit. He felt her walls tighten around him as she overstimulated herself. His eyes would alternate between the filthy things she was doing to get herself off and to her face; how beautiful she looked with her eyes closed and her bottom lip sucked in, her teeth biting down yet failing to withhold the moans that escaped her throat.</p><p>Severus couldn&rsquo;t stand it any longer. He lifted her up and rolled her over to the side, allowing her to fall onto the mattress. He got up and placed himself between her legs, angling down slowly until his member was once again buried deep inside her. </p><p>Lyra moaned at the intrusion. Her eyes closed briefly in pleasure. Her eyes fluttered open once more and watched as he towered over her, thrusting in and out of her, completely driving but lust and greed. It was intoxicating. Her hands pleasured herself and she found herself working closer and closer towards her orgasm. </p><p>He could feel her clenching down hard around him, her breathing became sparse as she held her breath the closer she got to her unraveling. He tried to maintain a steady pace but he could feel his balls tightening as he felt his orgasm near too.</p><p>&ldquo;Come for me, Lyra,&rdquo; he whispered, &ldquo;Come for me, my love.&rdquo;</p><p>And she did.</p><p>Her hips bucked up into his, a strangled scream escaped her. The look on her face was enough to push him over the edge. He felt her walls pulse as he came inside her. He collapsed on top of her briefly, his skin sticking to hers from the layer of sweat that had accumulated. He rolled to the side and Lyra held his hand.</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll shower and I&rsquo;ll walk you past the anti-apparation barrier,&rdquo; he said, squeezing her hand.</p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t want to come with me?&rdquo; she asked.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if I could look Lucius and Narcissa in the eye after shagging their niece,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>She laughed, &ldquo;Fair call.&rdquo;</p><p>After a few silent moments together in bed, a tug pulled Lyra out of the bed and towards the bathroom for a shower. They walked side by side through the hallways of Hogwarts, all she wanted was to hold his hand. She gave him a small smile as they reached the Forbidden Forest.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see you tonight?&rdquo; she asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Provided Cissy and Lucius don&rsquo;t want you to stay for dinner,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>She pursed her lips and nodded. Severus reached down to gently caress her face, leaning forward he left a kiss on her forehead. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see you soon, my love,&rdquo; he whispered.</p><p>&ldquo;I love you,&rdquo; she replied before stepping back slightly and turning on the spot.</p><p>Lyra mentally braced herself at the sight of the Manor. With a deep breath in and slow exhale, she found the nerve to walk down the all too familiar path and back into her family home. She let herself in, hanging her coat on the hanger near the door.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh Lyra,&rdquo; Narcissa said, darting down the stairs. &ldquo;How good to see you again.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Morning, Aunty,&rdquo; she replied, embracing her aunt.</p><p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; Narcissa said, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to get you looking good and presentable.&rdquo;</p><p>Narcissa whisked her niece away, taking her back up the stairs and to her and Lucius&rsquo; wing of the house. Right next to their shared room was Narcissa&rsquo;s own personal wardrobe, if one could call it that. It was a room, lined with the latest and greatest fashion. Coats with rich furs and dresses of different colours and fabrics hung back to back, all organised by designer of course. Sitting in the centre was an open set of drawers with boots and heels, along with some handbags.</p><p>Lyra looked indifferent, having seen this all before. Narcissa loved to play fancy dress up with her niece, particularly when she came of age. She would beg to dress her and take her along to fancy balls and tea parties that the pure bloods would hold but Lyra refused.</p><p>Now, Narcissa finally had her moment to pick out the best outfit for Lyra. &ldquo;So, what have you been thinking?&rdquo; she asked Lyra who was standing there looking rather bored.</p><p>She shrugged, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure whatever you pick will be nice.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Have a look around,&rdquo; she urged, &ldquo;Try something.&rdquo;</p><p>Lyra could tell her aunt was desperate to try and bond with the girl as she had tried several times before. It wasn&rsquo;t that Lyra didn&rsquo;t care about her looks, she did, but she just knew that whatever she&rsquo;d pick would be wrong. She stepped forward and browsed the racks before pulling out a modest black dress that was high cut, with long sleeves and showed off a bit of her legs. &ldquo;How about this?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, you shouldn&rsquo;t wear black, my dear,&rdquo; Narcissa said, taking the dress from her niece and putting it back, &ldquo;Your mother would wear black all the time, it&rsquo;s a very dominating colour, would leave the wrong impression.&rdquo;</p><p>Lyra sucked in her lips spotted a red dress with black lace detailing, she pulled it out and looked at it.</p><p>&ldquo;Too short,&rdquo; her aunt said, &ldquo;Red is also a bit aggressive, don&rsquo;t you think?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; Lyra said, shoving the dress back into place.</p><p>She gravitated towards a green velvet wrap dress. &ldquo;Great colour and style but velvet is a bit 70&rsquo;s,&rdquo; Narcissa said.</p><p>&ldquo;How about you pick something out for me?&rdquo; Lyra said.</p><p>Her aunt nodded and pulled out a white and black polka dot chiffon dress with lace accents, &ldquo;How about this?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It looks a bit like a sack,&rdquo; Lyra said.</p><p>&ldquo;Trust me, it doesn&rsquo;t look like a sack when it&rsquo;s on,&rdquo; Narcissa insisted.</p><p>Lyra reached out and put the dress on, &ldquo;Huh. It&rsquo;s actually not too bad.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Modest and feminine,&rdquo; Narcissa said, &ldquo;It does have a bit of your personality too. I think it&rsquo;s good. Now shoes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t just wear boots with it?&rdquo; Lyra asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be ridiculous,&rdquo; Narcissa said in heightened tone with a dismissive hand wave. She looked around the set of shoes she had before settling for a white pair with a black base, &ldquo;These.&rdquo;</p><p>Lyra took them and slipped them on.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh look at you, Lyra,&rdquo; Narcissa said, &ldquo;You look gorgeous.&rdquo;</p><p>Lyra looked at herself in the mirror and span around. She did look gorgeous but she didn&rsquo;t feel like it was here. </p><p>&ldquo;Now makeup,&rdquo; her aunt said, drawing her wand.</p><p>Lyra allowed her aunt to go a bit overboard with her makeup but when she looked at the final product she was impressed. Her lips were painted with a nude lipstick and she had a bright base with dreamy eyes that didn&rsquo;t look too different from her without makeup. She smiled at the sight of herself.</p><p>&ldquo;I look great,&rdquo; Lyra said, &ldquo;Thank you, Aunty.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re gorgeous,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;Much prettier than your mother was at your age.&rdquo;</p><p>Lyra laughed, &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t say that.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I can because she&rsquo;s my sister,&rdquo; Narcissa said, &ldquo;Still no suitors?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not interested.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, you are good at your work and I can accept it if you want to be single for the rest of your life and just work on your research but Lucius told me that there may be something going on with Severus.&rdquo;</p><p>Lyra had let her guard down a bit too much over the short time with her aunt and her face fell slightly at the mention of Severus, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Lyra,&rdquo; Narcissa said, pulling her niece&rsquo;s hands into hers and looking deep into her eyes. &ldquo;You have a duty.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve all had to make sacrifices, my dear,&rdquo; she said squeezing her hands.</p><p>&ldquo;Uncle told me about you two,&rdquo; Lyra said, &ldquo;Do you regret it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;When I was young I did,&rdquo; Narcissa said, her face softening as she spoke. &ldquo;It took me years to get over the relationship I had before him but Lucius respected that. He gave me distance, flowered me with gifts and eventually I fell in love with him and then we had Draco. You&rsquo;ll learn to adapt to the situation.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What made you fall in love with him?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;His kindness, I saw him playing with you when I was babysitting you one afternoon,&rdquo; she reminisced, &ldquo;He was teaching you the piano, he had you propped up on his knee and you were following along. I knew he&rsquo;d be a great father, although his affection wasn&rsquo;t as great as it was towards Draco as it was to you.&rdquo;</p><p>Lyra nodded.</p><p>&ldquo;It took time but I do love him,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;You too will learn to love whomever you marry.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Mum mentioned Barty Crouch Junior as a potential spouse when I visited,&rdquo; Lyra said. </p><p>&ldquo;I would prefer if you didn&rsquo;t marry a Death Eater,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;It caused too much trouble in our relationship.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yet you suggested Carrow?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;There aren&rsquo;t many of the Sacred 28 left to choose from,&rdquo; Narcissa said.</p><p>A knock on the door was heard, preventing Lyra from dropping a snarky comment. Narcissa flicked her wand towards the door, opening it and revealing her husband.</p><p>&ldquo;My two favourite ladies,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>Narcissa went to greet him with a chaste kiss on the lips and Lyra gave him a brief hug.</p><p>&ldquo;You look beautiful, Lyra,&rdquo; he said, tucking her hair behind her ear and resting a hand on her shoulder. &ldquo;We best be off, don&rsquo;t want to keep the Wizengamot waiting.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Are you not coming, Aunty?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, I can&rsquo;t take Draco,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s too young.&rdquo;</p><p>Lyra frowned but nodded. </p><p>&ldquo;No one from school wanted to come?&rdquo; Lucius enquired, &ldquo;Severus? Or your other colleagues who helped?&rdquo;</p><p>She shook her head, &ldquo;No, it was a bit last minute to be honest.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not every day a former student receives an Order of Merlin,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m surprised.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine,&rdquo; she shrugged, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like the attention, anyway.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s sure to be a lot of press,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;But don&rsquo;t worry. I had a special chat to Rita Skeeter about the bullshit she&rsquo;s been writing about you lately.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I appreciate it,&rdquo; Lyra replied, &ldquo;Hopefully today goes without a hitch.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;ll be a problem if you&rsquo;re late. Go,&rdquo; she insisted waving the pair of them away.</p><p>Lucius&rsquo; hand rested on her upper back and gently guided out of the room. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be using the floo network,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>She nodded and lead the way down the stairs, through the foyer and into the living room. She stepped into the fireplace after grabbing a handful of floo powder. She sprinkled the powder around her, the green flames starting to lick at her. &ldquo;Ministry of Magic, Atrium,&rdquo; she said clearly before being sucked into the fireplace.</p><p>Gracefully, she stepped out of the gilded fireplace and onto the dark hard wood floor of the Atrium. She walked forward a few steps and found herself hounded by a group of reporters. There were bright flashes from a camera, Lyra closing her eyes and wincing away, shocked by the assault. Each reporter was talking over the other and Lyra couldn&rsquo;t process anything that was being said. </p><p>She felt a hand press lightly on her shoulder, drawing her attention away from the journalists and up to her Uncle. He gave the girl a firm squeeze to reassure her and smiled. A small smirk played across Lyra&rsquo;s face as she realised the role her Uncle wanted her to play. She was dressed the part of the innocent and demure niece of the wealthy, well-established businessman and she knew what she had to do.</p><p>He looked back at the crowd and affectionately pulled Lyra closer to him, &ldquo;One at a time,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;My dear niece isn&rsquo;t used to all the attention. We&rsquo;ll take a few questions before we head off to the ceremony.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Miss Lestrange,&rdquo; a man addressed the young witch, &ldquo;How does it feel to be the youngest and one of the few witches to be awarded an Order of Merlin?&rdquo;</p><p>She smiled, &ldquo;Honestly, I am honoured and I am so touched to have my work acknowledged to this degree. I never expected to achieve one in my lifetime so it does come as a bit of a surprise to me but I&rsquo;m just glad my research healed and saved the lives of so many people. I hope that in my receiving of this award I can inspire other young witches and wizards to pursue excellence and work towards a better world.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Miss Lestrange, how do your parents feel about this?&rdquo;</p><p>Lyra allowed her face to flicker with a brief look of sadness, &ldquo;I have very little contact with my biological parents but I am so glad to have my Uncle Lucius by my side as he raised me to be the witch I am today.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Narcissa and I are so proud of her work,&rdquo; Lucius said, giving her an affectionate squeeze, &ldquo;We are so glad that despite her parentage that Lyra has turned out to be such a beautiful and intelligent witch.&rdquo;</p><p>She looked up at her Uncle and smiled, &ldquo;I consider this man to be my father.&rdquo; Although she did believe the words she was saying to a degree, she couldn&rsquo;t help but feel a slight pain in her chest as her thoughts flicked over to the recent memory of her parents in prison.</p><p>&ldquo;And what do you think Emily Wiltshire would have to say about your Order of Merlin, Lyra?&rdquo;</p><p>That voice. </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to regret this, Lyra.&rdquo; </p><p>It matched the howler she had received.</p><p>The crowd parted slightly and revealed the owner of the voice who spoke out.</p><p>Jack Thompson.</p>",
