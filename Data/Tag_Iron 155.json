That was all we could hear in this big house, not\nfar from the sea. Everything else was silent.</p><p>They\nhad lived here for at least a decade, after finally getting married.\nIf you knew the time it took them &hellip; Between their \u00a0feelings, hard\nto confess and the world to save, Stephen Strange and Tony Stark had\na hard time finishing up like this. After years of protecting the\nworld, the genius had decided to buy a small, isolated house near the\nwater in a quiet place. And they had lived so many things there &hellip;\nBoth of them were now sitting in the living room couch. Tony had his\nhead on Stephen&rsquo;s shoulder and looked exhausted. He had spent most of\nhis life being generous, he had nearly died many times, but had\nalways made it fine. He was now in his seventies.</p><p>Stephen\nhad an arm around Tony. Although he was a little younger than his\nhusband, magic had slowed down his metabolism, to the point that for\nthe moment he still had the strength of a forty-year-old man even\nthough he was in his sixties. They were happy, and they could finally\nhave time for them, although the Sorcerer Supreme still had \u00a0his\nduties. Everything was fine. Or almost. The long breath of the one\nwho was once Iron Man was more and more disturbing, a sign that he\nwas getting weaker every moment.</p><p>\n<br/>He\nknew he would soon be gone. Life had not been kind to him: his\nchildhood, alcohol, sleepless nights, stress, trauma and almost died\nmany time had significantly reduced his life expectancy. He was very\nhappy to have lived so far with the man he loved. Gently, Tony looked\nup at Stephen, with a smile on his face. The latter turned to him, a\nsad look on his face. He looked like he had cried but had quickly\nwiped away his tears. The genius however didn&rsquo;t see it.</p><p>&ldquo; Stephen\n? Can I ask you a question\u00a0?\u201d<br/></p><p>\n&rdquo; Go ahead Tony.\u201d \n</p><p>With\nbright eyes, the sorcerer was watching his husband, who caught his\nbreath to formulate his question.<br/></p><p>&ldquo; Would\nyou marry me again ?\u201d<br/></p><p>The\nDoctor smiled weakly. The answer to the question was obvious.\nNervously, his left hand moved, playing with the wedding ring he\nwore. This kind of question was really made inTony Stark : he needed\nto be reassured about their relationship, even at this age, even if\nthey were already married. It was \u00a0kind of a little game between\nthem. So his lover was playing it and answered.<br/></p><p>&rdquo; Yes\nTony. Always.\u201d<br/></p><p>He\nanswered in a soft tone, a tone that Tony particularly liked. Oh, how\nhe loved his wizard &hellip; He did not regret for a second that he\nmarried him. Then, he rose his face a little to tenderly kiss his\nhusband, as if to seal their union again.<br/></p><p>\u201cI\nlove you Stephen.\u201d<br/></p><p>Slowly,\nTony rested his head on Stephen&rsquo;s shoulder. The latter had tears\nrunning down his cheeks, while there was only silence. Then, nothing.\nIt was only a moment after he slowly turned his head to see his soul\nmate&rsquo;s eyes, they were empty. Without life.<br/></p><p>&ldquo; I\nlove you too Tony&hellip;\u201d He breathed softly<br/></p><p>Stephen\nexpired a long time as he cried. His body was shaking. He was alone.\nHis love had just left him, \u00a0after saying soft words. After this\nexhausting, happy, sad but amazing life, he was gone. The Sorcerer\nSupreme laid a kiss on the genius&rsquo;s head, while tears were still\nmaking their way down his cheeks. He was alone. This was how he had\nspent part of his life, and after finding his soulmate, he was going\nto have to return to this solitude, his soul hurt. Damn pain &hellip;<br/></p><p>After\nhe let himself go and cried for a long time, the Doctor sat up on the\ncouch and blew as he positioned his hands in front of him,\nconcentrating. The Eye of Agamotto, that artifact he was constantly\nwearing around his neck opened, leaving a green glow appear. He knew\nthe gestures. By heart. And he did them precisely.<br/></p><p>Tick\ntock. The Time Stone activated and manipulated, the guardian went\nback, changing time. Life came back in Tony&rsquo;s eyes, his Tony, and he\nset time back as the Eye closed.</p><h2>\n_________\n\n</h2><p>\u201cStephen\n? Can I ask you a question ?\u201d<br/></p><p>\n&rdquo; Go ahead Tony.\u201d \n</p><p>\n&ldquo; Would\nyou marry me again ?\u201d \n</p><p>\n&rdquo; Yes\nTony. Always.\u201d \n</p><p>\n&ldquo; I love you Stephen.\u201d</p><p>Tick\ntock. Silence. No more life. Tears and pain.<br/></p><p>&rdquo; I\nlove you too Tony.\u201d<br/></p><p>Pain.\nLove. The end. The tears. Pain. Always the pain. Those feelings. This\ndamn pain while he felt only loneliness. Tick tock. The Eye opened.\nThere was this green glow and the Time Stone. Time went back a few\nmoments, and life was again breathed into the genius&rsquo;s body.<br/></p><p>&ldquo; Can\nI ask you a question ?\u201d<br/></p><p>That\nlook. This look that Stephen did not want to leave. No, he didn&rsquo;t\nwant to leave it.<br/></p><p>&rdquo; Would you marry me again ?\u201d<br/></p><p>Then\nthe positive answer. It would always be positive. The kiss was so\nsweet. A kiss between two husbands, two people who loved each other.<br/></p><p>&ldquo; I\nlove you Stephen.\u201d<br/></p><p>\n &rdquo; I love you too Tony.\u201d \n</p><p>Oh,\nif he knew &hellip; That love was beating Time. The tears again. And that\npain &hellip; It was worse than a dagger in the heart. That pain &hellip; The\npain of these words, of saying thoses. And in the end &hellip; This love\nflew away at the same time as life.<br/></p><p>Tick\ntock. Back in time again. Same conversation. Same words. And always\nthat pain. Stephen wanted to scream. But he preferred to come back\nand see his husband alive again. It didn&rsquo;t matter the price of magic.\nHe was paying it constantly. And now again. How many times had he\nused the Stone exactly? How many times had he seen Tony died? How\nmany times had he heard and repeated the same words? How many tears\nhad flowed? No idea. Twenty times maybe. No&hellip;. Surely more. One\nhundred. Maybe a thousand. A million. He no longer had the notion of\ntime. It wasn&rsquo;t a time loop. He just went back in time to avoid the\ndeath of his husband being too real<br/></p><p>As\nthe wizard was about to start the process again, the front door\ncrashed open. This was changing the moment &hellip; It didn&rsquo;t happen\nbefore. He looked up and Stephen looked at his visitors. Wong, Wanda\nMaximoff and Thor came in and stood in front of the Sorcerer Supreme.<br/></p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s\nenough,&rdquo; declared Wong, &ldquo; You&rsquo;re going to jeopardize the\nbalance of time if it&rsquo;s not already done. And you&rsquo;re probably going\nto kill yourself Stephen.\u201d<br/></p><p>\n&quot;What\nare you doing here? &rdquo; The Doctor said.</p><p>\n&ldquo;We\ncame to help you my friend&rdquo; The God of Thunder replied.</p><p>As\nWong approached Stephen, Stephen turned his head to his husband,\nsniffing slightly. Wanda and Thor stayed behind, watching the wizard.<br/></p><p>&ldquo;I\ndon&rsquo;t need help&rdquo; The Supreme Sorcerer finally said.<br/></p><p>\n&ldquo;\nYes you do Stephen&rdquo; Wong replied, &ldquo; You&rsquo;ve been doing this\nfor too long&hellip; You must let him go.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;I\ndon&rsquo;t want to. I don&rsquo;t want to&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Gently,\nhe stroked the hair of his husband, who still had his head on his\nshoulder. He knew exactly what his visitors had come to do. Besides,\nhe was surprised that they knew it. As he went back in time, again\nand again, nothing or nobody should have realized it except him. He\nthen asked them how they knew, and how they managed to come despite\nthe time jump each time.<br/></p><p>&ldquo;I\nfelt the change. And I immediately warned friends who would be less\naffected &rdquo; Wong replied.<br/></p><p>Stephen\nbarely glanced at them. Of course, his friend had known, he knew how\nthe stone worked. And even if it was difficult to counterback, he\ndidn&rsquo;t doubt that his colleague \u00a0had managed to find a something in\norder to come here. Thor was a God, he didn&rsquo;t doubt that he was more\nresistant, and He knew the Infinity Stones. As for to the Scarlet\nWitch, she knew mental manipulations, so she must had felt some\nsensations of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu.<br/></p><p>&ldquo;Doctor\n&hellip;&rdquo; \u00a0the young woman started, \u00a0&quot; You have to stop &hellip;<br/></p><p>\n\u00a0&quot;No&hellip;&ldquo;</p><p>\n&quot;You&rsquo;re\nhurting yourself Strange, &rdquo; Thor added as he came closer, \u00a0&quot;I\nfully understand the situation &hellip;. No one wants to lose someone we\nlove &hellip;.&ldquo;</p><p>\n\u00a0&rdquo;\nSo you do understand why I do this &ldquo; The Sorcerer Supreme\nretorted..</p><p>\n&rdquo;\nI do, but you have to let him go, you can&rsquo;t do this forever, the\nstone could kill you &hellip;&ldquo;</p><p>\n&rdquo;\nAt least I&rsquo;ll join him.&ldquo;</p><p>\n&rdquo;\nDon&rsquo;t say that Stephen &hellip;&ldquo; Wong interfered.</p><p>Surely,\nnothing would change Stephen&rsquo;s mind. He didn&rsquo;t want to stop. Stopping\nthis meant letting Tony go, and no, he didn&rsquo;t want to. He had lived\nso many things &hellip; Had so many losses. And now that his life was a\nlittle quieter, this, this was his only source of happiness. No. This\ntime, he didn&rsquo;t want to lose a part of himself again. He broke the\nnature laws, magic laws, and the oath he had taken to use the Time\nStone only in extreme cases. Wong and Thor were right in front of\nStephen now, Wanda staying a little behind. And the wizard knew very\nwell what they were doing. They wanted to take from him the only\nthing that allowed him to stay with his husband. Immediately, the\nSorcerer Supreme put his hand on the Eye of Agamotto.<br/></p><p>&quot;Stephen\n&hellip; Give it to us&hellip; &rdquo; Wong said.<br/></p><p>\n&ldquo;Or\nwhat ?&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;We\ndon&rsquo;t want to force you,&rdquo; The God of Thunder replied.</p><p>\n&ldquo;\nBut that&rsquo;s why you&rsquo;re here isn&rsquo;t it ?&rdquo;\n\n</p><p>Stephen\nshot an accusing look at the two Avengers. It was obvious, and the\ntwo weren&rsquo;t hiding it. As Wong. Wanda finally stepped forward, a\nlittle shyly, in front of the wizard too, while some red light appear\nin her hands.<br/></p><p>&ldquo;\nI don&rsquo;t want to do this Doctor &hellip; But we have no choice. &rdquo;<br/></p><p>\n&ldquo;\nDo you know that manipulating me is a difficult thing Maximoff? &rdquo;</p><p>\n\u00a0&quot;\nI do. But I only want to help you. I can &hellip; soften this. &ldquo;</p><p>While\na tear fell again on the cheek of the former neurosurgeon, he had a\nlost look, then more thoughtful for a few moments. He knew the\nabilities of the witch, and even if he didn&rsquo;t want to leave Tony &hellip;\nThe proposal seemed fair. They were his friends, yes. But Tony was\nhis love, the only one he ever had. He released the Eye and looked at\nthe three visitors with bright, red eyes.<br/></p><p>&quot;Just\nonce. Only one last time.&rdquo;<br/></p><p>\n&ldquo;\nI&rsquo;m sorry Stephen &hellip;&rdquo; Wong said, shaking his head gently.</p><p>The\nlatter then signaled to the young brunette and she quickly put her\nhand in front of the Sorcerer Supreme, using her powers to interact\nwith Stephen&rsquo;s mind. The man asked again to say goodbye to Tony\nbefore he just stopped talking. As Wanda was slow to reach Stephen&rsquo;s\nmind because of all his mystical protections, she managed to do it\nanyway. It made her feel bad to have to manipulate the man like that,\nand she didn&rsquo;t want it. It was Wong&rsquo;s last resort.<br/></p><p>\nThe\nSupreme wizard shook his head as the tears ran down again. He didn&rsquo;t\nwant. He just wanted to hear his beloved one again. He wanted to see\nhim alive. He didn&rsquo;t want to, and wasn&rsquo;t \u00a0ready to let him go yet.\nHowever, as he tried to resist the young woman&rsquo;s magic, he felt that\nhe couldn&rsquo;t hold out very long. Gently, Wanda&rsquo;s magic snicked up into\nStephen&rsquo;s mind. He had no choice but to lower his hand, while Wong\ntook the Eye. It was over. No more time manipulation. The Sorcerer\nSupreme turned his head one last time towards his dead husband, his\neyes watering. He wouldn&rsquo;t hear it anymore. He would never see his\nbrown eyes sparkle when he had an idea anymore. He wouldn&rsquo;t see that\nsmirk he was had when he was teasing him. His hands would never\ngently caress his own to try to calm his tremor anymore. He wouldn&rsquo;t\nfeel his lips again. No more. \n</p><p>\u201c Tony&hellip;\u201d<br/></p><p>Stephen\nmurmured softly as his eyes slowly closed. Wanda made him fall asleep\nto calm him down, and manage him when he woke up. No way she makes\nhim forget, or she gives him the illusion of having continued. Just\nthe reality. There was no need to make him suffer even more. He then\nfalls asleep, leaving a silence in the room for a moment. Then, Wong\nlooked at Cloak of Levitation. The \u00a0artefact knew immediately what\nshe had to do. She gently surrounded her owner to lift it, and to\nmake him fly.<br/></p><p>&ldquo;\nI&rsquo;m going to bring him back to the Sanctum.&rdquo; The wizard\ndeclared, &ldquo; It&rsquo;s better if he wakes up there. &rdquo;<br/></p><p>\n&ldquo;I&rsquo;m\nbringing Tony back to the Avengers HQ in the meantime, &rdquo; Thor\nsaid gently, lifting the body of his friend, &ldquo; We&rsquo;ll have to\n&hellip;.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;\nWe&rsquo;ll see that when we get there and later Thor &rdquo; Wanda\ninterrupted, seeing that the God was looking for his words.</p><p>Aprouving\nwith a gesture of the head, the blond then carried Tony. Wong opened\na portal, and the three disappeared, with the Cloak wearing the\nSorcerer Supreme. As he slept deeply, Stephen saw himself with Tony\nagain. They were on the roof of the Avengers building, and were\nsmiling at each other. Surprisingly, the Doctor knew it was a dream.\nBut that didn&rsquo;t stop him from taking the genius one last time in his\narms, to say goodbye, to tell him how much he was already missing\nhim. In truth, Wanda had manipulated his mind so that Stephen would\nbe aware that he was dreaming, and that he would see Tony one last\ntime, calmly and tenderly.<br/></p><p>&ldquo;Goodbye\nTony&hellip;. I love you. In all time, all places. Always and forever. &rdquo;<br/></p>",

He then\nfalls asleep, leaving a silence in the room for a moment. Then, Wong\nlooked at Cloak of Levitation. The \u00a0artefact knew immediately what\nshe had to do. She gently surrounded her owner to lift it, and to\nmake him fly.<br></p><p>\u201c\nI\u2019m going to bring him back to the Sanctum.\u201d The wizard\ndeclared, \u201c It\u2019s better if he wakes up there. \u201d<br></p><p>\n\u201cI\u2019m\nbringing Tony back to the Avengers HQ in the meantime, \u201d Thor\nsaid gently, lifting the body of his friend, \u201c We\u2019ll have to\n\u2026.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201c\nWe\u2019ll see that when we get there and later Thor \u201d Wanda\ninterrupted, seeing that the God was looking for his words.</p><p>Aprouving\nwith a gesture of the head, the blond then carried Tony. Wong opened\na portal, and the three disappeared, with the Cloak wearing the\nSorcerer Supreme. As he slept deeply, Stephen saw himself with Tony\nagain. They were on the roof of the Avengers building, and were\nsmiling at each other. Surprisingly, the Doctor knew it was a dream.\nBut that didn\u2019t stop him from taking the genius one last time in his\narms, to say goodbye, to tell him how much he was already missing\nhim. In truth, Wanda had manipulated his mind so that Stephen would\nbe aware that he was dreaming, and that he would see Tony one last\ntime, calmly and tenderly.<br></p><p>\u201cGoodbye\nTony\u2026.

That was all we could hear in this big house, not\nfar from the sea. Everything else was silent.</p><p>They\nhad lived here for at least a decade, after finally getting married.\nIf you knew the time it took them \u2026 Between their \u00a0feelings, hard\nto confess and the world to save, Stephen Strange and Tony Stark had\na hard time finishing up like this. After years of protecting the\nworld, the genius had decided to buy a small, isolated house near the\nwater in a quiet place. And they had lived so many things there \u2026\nBoth of them were now sitting in the living room couch. Tony had his\nhead on Stephen\u2019s shoulder and looked exhausted. He had spent most of\nhis life being generous, he had nearly died many times, but had\nalways made it fine. He was now in his seventies.</p><p>Stephen\nhad an arm around Tony. Although he was a little younger than his\nhusband, magic had slowed down his metabolism, to the point that for\nthe moment he still had the strength of a forty-year-old man even\nthough he was in his sixties. They were happy, and they could finally\nhave time for them, although the Sorcerer Supreme still had \u00a0his\nduties. Everything was fine. Or almost. The long breath of the one\nwho was once Iron Man was more and more disturbing, a sign that he\nwas getting weaker every moment.</p><p>\n<br>He\nknew he would soon be gone. Life had not been kind to him: his\nchildhood, alcohol, sleepless nights, stress, trauma and almost died\nmany time had significantly reduced his life expectancy. He was very\nhappy to have lived so far with the man he loved. Gently, Tony looked\nup at Stephen, with a smile on his face. The latter turned to him, a\nsad look on his face. He looked like he had cried but had quickly\nwiped away his tears. The genius however didn\u2019t see it.</p><p>\u201c Stephen\n? Can I ask you a question\u00a0?\u201d<br></p><p>\n\u201d Go ahead Tony.\u201d \n</p><p>With\nbright eyes, the sorcerer was watching his husband, who caught his\nbreath to formulate his question.<br></p><p>\u201c Would\nyou marry me again ?\u201d<br></p><p>The\nDoctor smiled weakly. The answer to the question was obvious.\nNervously, his left hand moved, playing with the wedding ring he\nwore. This kind of question was really made inTony Stark : he needed\nto be reassured about their relationship, even at this age, even if\nthey were already married. It was \u00a0kind of a little game between\nthem. So his lover was playing it and answered.<br></p><p>\u201d Yes\nTony. Always.\u201d<br></p><p>He\nanswered in a soft tone, a tone that Tony particularly liked. Oh, how\nhe loved his wizard \u2026 He did not regret for a second that he\nmarried him. Then, he rose his face a little to tenderly kiss his\nhusband, as if to seal their union again.<br></p><p>\u201cI\nlove you Stephen.\u201d<br></p><p>Slowly,\nTony rested his head on Stephen\u2019s shoulder. The latter had tears\nrunning down his cheeks, while there was only silence. Then, nothing.\nIt was only a moment after he slowly turned his head to see his soul\nmate\u2019s eyes, they were empty. Without life.<br></p><p>\u201c I\nlove you too Tony\u2026\u201d He breathed softly<br></p><p>Stephen\nexpired a long time as he cried. His body was shaking. He was alone.\nHis love had just left him, \u00a0after saying soft words. After this\nexhausting, happy, sad but amazing life, he was gone. The Sorcerer\nSupreme laid a kiss on the genius\u2019s head, while tears were still\nmaking their way down his cheeks. He was alone. This was how he had\nspent part of his life, and after finding his soulmate, he was going\nto have to return to this solitude, his soul hurt. Damn pain \u2026<br></p><p>After\nhe let himself go and cried for a long time, the Doctor sat up on the\ncouch and blew as he positioned his hands in front of him,\nconcentrating. The Eye of Agamotto, that artifact he was constantly\nwearing around his neck opened, leaving a green glow appear. He knew\nthe gestures. By heart. And he did them precisely.<br></p><p>Tick\ntock. The Time Stone activated and manipulated, the guardian went\nback, changing time. Life came back in Tony\u2019s eyes, his Tony, and he\nset time back as the Eye closed.</p><h2>\n_________\n\n</h2><p>\u201cStephen\n? Can I ask you a question ?\u201d<br></p><p>\n\u201d Go ahead Tony.\u201d \n</p><p>\n\u201c Would\nyou marry me again ?\u201d \n</p><p>\n\u201d Yes\nTony. Always.\u201d \n</p><p>\n\u201c I love you Stephen.\u201d</p><p>Tick\ntock. Silence. No more life. Tears and pain.<br></p><p>\u201d I\nlove you too Tony.\u201d<br></p><p>Pain.\nLove. The end. The tears. Pain. Always the pain. Those feelings. This\ndamn pain while he felt only loneliness. Tick tock. The Eye opened.\nThere was this green glow and the Time Stone. Time went back a few\nmoments, and life was again breathed into the genius\u2019s body.<br></p><p>\u201c Can\nI ask you a question ?\u201d<br></p><p>That\nlook. This look that Stephen did not want to leave. No, he didn\u2019t\nwant to leave it.<br></p><p>\u201d Would you marry me again ?\u201d<br></p><p>Then\nthe positive answer. It would always be positive. The kiss was so\nsweet. A kiss between two husbands, two people who loved each other.<br></p><p>\u201c I\nlove you Stephen.\u201d<br></p><p>\n \u201d I love you too Tony.\u201d \n</p><p>Oh,\nif he knew \u2026 That love was beating Time. The tears again. And that\npain \u2026 It was worse than a dagger in the heart. That pain \u2026 The\npain of these words, of saying thoses. And in the end \u2026 This love\nflew away at the same time as life.<br></p><p>Tick\ntock. Back in time again. Same conversation. Same words. And always\nthat pain. Stephen wanted to scream. But he preferred to come back\nand see his husband alive again. It didn\u2019t matter the price of magic.\nHe was paying it constantly. And now again. How many times had he\nused the Stone exactly? How many times had he seen Tony died? How\nmany times had he heard and repeated the same words? How many tears\nhad flowed? No idea. Twenty times maybe. No\u2026. Surely more. One\nhundred. Maybe a thousand. A million. He no longer had the notion of\ntime. It wasn\u2019t a time loop. He just went back in time to avoid the\ndeath of his husband being too real<br></p><p>As\nthe wizard was about to start the process again, the front door\ncrashed open. This was changing the moment \u2026 It didn\u2019t happen\nbefore. He looked up and Stephen looked at his visitors. Wong, Wanda\nMaximoff and Thor came in and stood in front of the Sorcerer Supreme.<br></p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s\nenough,\u201d declared Wong, \u201c You\u2019re going to jeopardize the\nbalance of time if it\u2019s not already done. And you\u2019re probably going\nto kill yourself Stephen.\u201d<br></p><p>\n\"What\nare you doing here? \u201d The Doctor said.</p><p>\n\u201cWe\ncame to help you my friend\u201d The God of Thunder replied.</p><p>As\nWong approached Stephen, Stephen turned his head to his husband,\nsniffing slightly. Wanda and Thor stayed behind, watching the wizard.<br></p><p>\u201cI\ndon\u2019t need help\u201d The Supreme Sorcerer finally said.<br></p><p>\n\u201c\nYes you do Stephen\u201d Wong replied, \u201c You\u2019ve been doing this\nfor too long\u2026 You must let him go.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cI\ndon\u2019t want to. I don\u2019t want to\u2026\u201d</p><p>Gently,\nhe stroked the hair of his husband, who still had his head on his\nshoulder. He knew exactly what his visitors had come to do. Besides,\nhe was surprised that they knew it. As he went back in time, again\nand again, nothing or nobody should have realized it except him. He\nthen asked them how they knew, and how they managed to come despite\nthe time jump each time.<br></p><p>\u201cI\nfelt the change. And I immediately warned friends who would be less\naffected \u201d Wong replied.<br></p><p>Stephen\nbarely glanced at them. Of course, his friend had known, he knew how\nthe stone worked. And even if it was difficult to counterback, he\ndidn\u2019t doubt that his colleague \u00a0had managed to find a something in\norder to come here. Thor was a God, he didn\u2019t doubt that he was more\nresistant, and He knew the Infinity Stones. As for to the Scarlet\nWitch, she knew mental manipulations, so she must had felt some\nsensations of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu.<br></p><p>\u201cDoctor\n\u2026\u201d \u00a0the young woman started, \u00a0\" You have to stop \u2026<br></p><p>\n\u00a0\"No\u2026\u201c</p><p>\n\"You\u2019re\nhurting yourself Strange, \u201d Thor added as he came closer, \u00a0\"I\nfully understand the situation \u2026.

That was all we could hear in this big house, not\nfar from the sea. Everything else was silent.</p><p>They\nhad lived here for at least a decade, after finally getting married.\nIf you knew the time it took them &hellip; Between their &nbsp;feelings, hard\nto confess and the world to save, Stephen Strange and Tony Stark had\na hard time finishing up like this. After years of protecting the\nworld, the genius had decided to buy a small, isolated house near the\nwater in a quiet place. And they had lived so many things there &hellip;\nBoth of them were now sitting in the living room couch. Tony had his\nhead on Stephen&rsquo;s shoulder and looked exhausted. He had spent most of\nhis life being generous, he had nearly died many times, but had\nalways made it fine. He was now in his seventies.</p><p>Stephen\nhad an arm around Tony. Although he was a little younger than his\nhusband, magic had slowed down his metabolism, to the point that for\nthe moment he still had the strength of a forty-year-old man even\nthough he was in his sixties. They were happy, and they could finally\nhave time for them, although the Sorcerer Supreme still had &nbsp;his\nduties. Everything was fine. Or almost. The long breath of the one\nwho was once Iron Man was more and more disturbing, a sign that he\nwas getting weaker every moment.</p><p>\n<br />He\nknew he would soon be gone. Life had not been kind to him: his\nchildhood, alcohol, sleepless nights, stress, trauma and almost died\nmany time had significantly reduced his life expectancy. He was very\nhappy to have lived so far with the man he loved. Gently, Tony looked\nup at Stephen, with a smile on his face. The latter turned to him, a\nsad look on his face. He looked like he had cried but had quickly\nwiped away his tears. The genius however didn&rsquo;t see it.</p><p>&ldquo; Stephen\n? Can I ask you a question&nbsp;?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>\n&rdquo; Go ahead Tony.&rdquo; \n</p><p>With\nbright eyes, the sorcerer was watching his husband, who caught his\nbreath to formulate his question.<br /></p><p>&ldquo; Would\nyou marry me again ?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>The\nDoctor smiled weakly. The answer to the question was obvious.\nNervously, his left hand moved, playing with the wedding ring he\nwore. This kind of question was really made inTony Stark : he needed\nto be reassured about their relationship, even at this age, even if\nthey were already married. It was &nbsp;kind of a little game between\nthem. So his lover was playing it and answered.<br /></p><p>&rdquo; Yes\nTony. Always.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>He\nanswered in a soft tone, a tone that Tony particularly liked. Oh, how\nhe loved his wizard &hellip; He did not regret for a second that he\nmarried him. Then, he rose his face a little to tenderly kiss his\nhusband, as if to seal their union again.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I\nlove you Stephen.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Slowly,\nTony rested his head on Stephen&rsquo;s shoulder. The latter had tears\nrunning down his cheeks, while there was only silence. Then, nothing.\nIt was only a moment after he slowly turned his head to see his soul\nmate&rsquo;s eyes, they were empty. Without life.<br /></p><p>&ldquo; I\nlove you too Tony&hellip;&rdquo; He breathed softly<br /></p><p>Stephen\nexpired a long time as he cried. His body was shaking. He was alone.\nHis love had just left him, &nbsp;after saying soft words. After this\nexhausting, happy, sad but amazing life, he was gone. The Sorcerer\nSupreme laid a kiss on the genius&rsquo;s head, while tears were still\nmaking their way down his cheeks. He was alone. This was how he had\nspent part of his life, and after finding his soulmate, he was going\nto have to return to this solitude, his soul hurt. Damn pain &hellip;<br /></p><p>After\nhe let himself go and cried for a long time, the Doctor sat up on the\ncouch and blew as he positioned his hands in front of him,\nconcentrating. The Eye of Agamotto, that artifact he was constantly\nwearing around his neck opened, leaving a green glow appear. He knew\nthe gestures. By heart. And he did them precisely.<br /></p><p>Tick\ntock. The Time Stone activated and manipulated, the guardian went\nback, changing time. Life came back in Tony&rsquo;s eyes, his Tony, and he\nset time back as the Eye closed.</p><h2>\n_________\n\n</h2><p>&ldquo;Stephen\n? Can I ask you a question ?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>\n&rdquo; Go ahead Tony.&rdquo; \n</p><p>\n&ldquo; Would\nyou marry me again ?&rdquo; \n</p><p>\n&rdquo; Yes\nTony. Always.&rdquo; \n</p><p>\n&ldquo; I love you Stephen.&rdquo;</p><p>Tick\ntock. Silence. No more life. Tears and pain.<br /></p><p>&rdquo; I\nlove you too Tony.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Pain.\nLove. The end. The tears. Pain. Always the pain. Those feelings. This\ndamn pain while he felt only loneliness. Tick tock. The Eye opened.\nThere was this green glow and the Time Stone. Time went back a few\nmoments, and life was again breathed into the genius&rsquo;s body.<br /></p><p>&ldquo; Can\nI ask you a question ?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>That\nlook. This look that Stephen did not want to leave. No, he didn&rsquo;t\nwant to leave it.<br /></p><p>&rdquo; Would you marry me again ?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Then\nthe positive answer. It would always be positive. The kiss was so\nsweet. A kiss between two husbands, two people who loved each other.<br /></p><p>&ldquo; I\nlove you Stephen.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>\n &rdquo; I love you too Tony.&rdquo; \n</p><p>Oh,\nif he knew &hellip; That love was beating Time. The tears again. And that\npain &hellip; It was worse than a dagger in the heart. That pain &hellip; The\npain of these words, of saying thoses. And in the end &hellip; This love\nflew away at the same time as life.<br /></p><p>Tick\ntock. Back in time again. Same conversation. Same words. And always\nthat pain. Stephen wanted to scream. But he preferred to come back\nand see his husband alive again. It didn&rsquo;t matter the price of magic.\nHe was paying it constantly. And now again. How many times had he\nused the Stone exactly? How many times had he seen Tony died? How\nmany times had he heard and repeated the same words? How many tears\nhad flowed? No idea. Twenty times maybe. No&hellip;. Surely more. One\nhundred. Maybe a thousand. A million. He no longer had the notion of\ntime. It wasn&rsquo;t a time loop. He just went back in time to avoid the\ndeath of his husband being too real<br /></p><p>As\nthe wizard was about to start the process again, the front door\ncrashed open. This was changing the moment &hellip; It didn&rsquo;t happen\nbefore. He looked up and Stephen looked at his visitors. Wong, Wanda\nMaximoff and Thor came in and stood in front of the Sorcerer Supreme.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s\nenough,&rdquo; declared Wong, &ldquo; You&rsquo;re going to jeopardize the\nbalance of time if it&rsquo;s not already done. And you&rsquo;re probably going\nto kill yourself Stephen.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>\n\"What\nare you doing here? &rdquo; The Doctor said.</p><p>\n&ldquo;We\ncame to help you my friend&rdquo; The God of Thunder replied.</p><p>As\nWong approached Stephen, Stephen turned his head to his husband,\nsniffing slightly. Wanda and Thor stayed behind, watching the wizard.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I\ndon&rsquo;t need help&rdquo; The Supreme Sorcerer finally said.<br /></p><p>\n&ldquo;\nYes you do Stephen&rdquo; Wong replied, &ldquo; You&rsquo;ve been doing this\nfor too long&hellip; You must let him go.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;I\ndon&rsquo;t want to. I don&rsquo;t want to&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Gently,\nhe stroked the hair of his husband, who still had his head on his\nshoulder. He knew exactly what his visitors had come to do. Besides,\nhe was surprised that they knew it. As he went back in time, again\nand again, nothing or nobody should have realized it except him. He\nthen asked them how they knew, and how they managed to come despite\nthe time jump each time.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I\nfelt the change. And I immediately warned friends who would be less\naffected &rdquo; Wong replied.<br /></p><p>Stephen\nbarely glanced at them. Of course, his friend had known, he knew how\nthe stone worked. And even if it was difficult to counterback, he\ndidn&rsquo;t doubt that his colleague &nbsp;had managed to find a something in\norder to come here. Thor was a God, he didn&rsquo;t doubt that he was more\nresistant, and He knew the Infinity Stones. As for to the Scarlet\nWitch, she knew mental manipulations, so she must had felt some\nsensations of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Doctor\n&hellip;&rdquo; &nbsp;the young woman started, &nbsp;\" You have to stop &hellip;<br /></p><p>\n&nbsp;\"No&hellip;&ldquo;</p><p>\n\"You&rsquo;re\nhurting yourself Strange, &rdquo; Thor added as he came closer, &nbsp;\"I\nfully understand the situation &hellip;. No one wants to lose someone we\nlove &hellip;.&ldquo;</p><p>\n&nbsp;&rdquo;\nSo you do understand why I do this &ldquo; The Sorcerer Supreme\nretorted..</p><p>\n&rdquo;\nI do, but you have to let him go, you can&rsquo;t do this forever, the\nstone could kill you &hellip;&ldquo;</p><p>\n&rdquo;\nAt least I&rsquo;ll join him.&ldquo;</p><p>\n&rdquo;\nDon&rsquo;t say that Stephen &hellip;&ldquo; Wong interfered.</p><p>Surely,\nnothing would change Stephen&rsquo;s mind. He didn&rsquo;t want to stop. Stopping\nthis meant letting Tony go, and no, he didn&rsquo;t want to. He had lived\nso many things &hellip; Had so many losses. And now that his life was a\nlittle quieter, this, this was his only source of happiness. No. This\ntime, he didn&rsquo;t want to lose a part of himself again. He broke the\nnature laws, magic laws, and the oath he had taken to use the Time\nStone only in extreme cases. Wong and Thor were right in front of\nStephen now, Wanda staying a little behind. And the wizard knew very\nwell what they were doing. They wanted to take from him the only\nthing that allowed him to stay with his husband. Immediately, the\nSorcerer Supreme put his hand on the Eye of Agamotto.<br /></p><p>\"Stephen\n&hellip; Give it to us&hellip; &rdquo; Wong said.<br /></p><p>\n&ldquo;Or\nwhat ?&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;We\ndon&rsquo;t want to force you,&rdquo; The God of Thunder replied.</p><p>\n&ldquo;\nBut that&rsquo;s why you&rsquo;re here isn&rsquo;t it ?&rdquo;\n\n</p><p>Stephen\nshot an accusing look at the two Avengers. It was obvious, and the\ntwo weren&rsquo;t hiding it. As Wong. Wanda finally stepped forward, a\nlittle shyly, in front of the wizard too, while some red light appear\nin her hands.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;\nI don&rsquo;t want to do this Doctor &hellip; But we have no choice. &rdquo;<br /></p><p>\n&ldquo;\nDo you know that manipulating me is a difficult thing Maximoff? &rdquo;</p><p>\n&nbsp;\"\nI do. But I only want to help you. I can &hellip; soften this. &ldquo;</p><p>While\na tear fell again on the cheek of the former neurosurgeon, he had a\nlost look, then more thoughtful for a few moments. He knew the\nabilities of the witch, and even if he didn&rsquo;t want to leave Tony &hellip;\nThe proposal seemed fair. They were his friends, yes. But Tony was\nhis love, the only one he ever had. He released the Eye and looked at\nthe three visitors with bright, red eyes.<br /></p><p>\"Just\nonce. Only one last time.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>\n&ldquo;\nI&rsquo;m sorry Stephen &hellip;&rdquo; Wong said, shaking his head gently.</p><p>The\nlatter then signaled to the young brunette and she quickly put her\nhand in front of the Sorcerer Supreme, using her powers to interact\nwith Stephen&rsquo;s mind. The man asked again to say goodbye to Tony\nbefore he just stopped talking. As Wanda was slow to reach Stephen&rsquo;s\nmind because of all his mystical protections, she managed to do it\nanyway. It made her feel bad to have to manipulate the man like that,\nand she didn&rsquo;t want it. It was Wong&rsquo;s last resort.<br /></p><p>\nThe\nSupreme wizard shook his head as the tears ran down again. He didn&rsquo;t\nwant. He just wanted to hear his beloved one again. He wanted to see\nhim alive. He didn&rsquo;t want to, and wasn&rsquo;t &nbsp;ready to let him go yet.\nHowever, as he tried to resist the young woman&rsquo;s magic, he felt that\nhe couldn&rsquo;t hold out very long. Gently, Wanda&rsquo;s magic snicked up into\nStephen&rsquo;s mind. He had no choice but to lower his hand, while Wong\ntook the Eye. It was over. No more time manipulation. The Sorcerer\nSupreme turned his head one last time towards his dead husband, his\neyes watering. He wouldn&rsquo;t hear it anymore. He would never see his\nbrown eyes sparkle when he had an idea anymore. He wouldn&rsquo;t see that\nsmirk he was had when he was teasing him. His hands would never\ngently caress his own to try to calm his tremor anymore. He wouldn&rsquo;t\nfeel his lips again. No more. \n</p><p>&ldquo; Tony&hellip;&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Stephen\nmurmured softly as his eyes slowly closed. Wanda made him fall asleep\nto calm him down, and manage him when he woke up. No way she makes\nhim forget, or she gives him the illusion of having continued. Just\nthe reality. There was no need to make him suffer even more. He then\nfalls asleep, leaving a silence in the room for a moment. Then, Wong\nlooked at Cloak of Levitation. The &nbsp;artefact knew immediately what\nshe had to do. She gently surrounded her owner to lift it, and to\nmake him fly.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;\nI&rsquo;m going to bring him back to the Sanctum.&rdquo; The wizard\ndeclared, &ldquo; It&rsquo;s better if he wakes up there. &rdquo;<br /></p><p>\n&ldquo;I&rsquo;m\nbringing Tony back to the Avengers HQ in the meantime, &rdquo; Thor\nsaid gently, lifting the body of his friend, &ldquo; We&rsquo;ll have to\n&hellip;.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;\nWe&rsquo;ll see that when we get there and later Thor &rdquo; Wanda\ninterrupted, seeing that the God was looking for his words.</p><p>Aprouving\nwith a gesture of the head, the blond then carried Tony. Wong opened\na portal, and the three disappeared, with the Cloak wearing the\nSorcerer Supreme. As he slept deeply, Stephen saw himself with Tony\nagain. They were on the roof of the Avengers building, and were\nsmiling at each other. Surprisingly, the Doctor knew it was a dream.\nBut that didn&rsquo;t stop him from taking the genius one last time in his\narms, to say goodbye, to tell him how much he was already missing\nhim. In truth, Wanda had manipulated his mind so that Stephen would\nbe aware that he was dreaming, and that he would see Tony one last\ntime, calmly and tenderly.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Goodbye\nTony&hellip;.
