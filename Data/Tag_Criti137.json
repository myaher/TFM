Guilt rose from the words he&rsquo;d swallowed. Momentary regret. A father shouldn&rsquo;t anticipate such darkness from his child. And to admit it to their </i>mother<i>.. The guilt kept rising, searing into his chest. The intense lack of sound was deafening. Even </i>scorn <i>would be welcome. Anything to break the void. Anything to kill his intuition.</i></p><p><i>Yet there was nothing. Only the subtle breathing of his wife. Her eyes, he could feel them on him. His own gaze felt heavy, unable to redirect from the door. It was the one that led down to his old workshop. The workshop, and their youngest child.</i></p><p><b>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve tried, darling.&rdquo; </b><i>Warm words, spoken with hope to soothe. Moving around to block his view of the door, her fingers gently ran through the white hair of her husband.&nbsp;</i><b>&ldquo;Pelor knows you&rsquo;ve tried. We both have.&rdquo;</b><i> The corner of her mouth twitched with a hint of a smile as she sought his gaze.&nbsp;</i><b>&ldquo;But she&rsquo;s as persistent as you and me combined. She&rsquo;s <i>going </i>to keep tinkering.&rdquo;</b><br /></p><p><i>Finally he could bear to look at her, losing himself for but a moment in those dark eyes of hers. For a sigh of time, his concerns faded. Heaving a sigh of his own, he slowly shook his head while adjusting the gold-trim glasses, closing his eyes to a passing thought.&nbsp;</i><b>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just.. Concerned.&rdquo;</b></p><p><b>&ldquo;I know. But she&rsquo;s not going to waste away in that old workshop. We won&rsquo;t let that happen.&rdquo; </b><i>Lifting his chin up to make him look at her, she was caught off guard by the depth of sorrow in his eyes. There was pain there, pain she hadn&rsquo;t seen in a long time. Pain of past deeds.</i><br /></p><p><b>&ldquo;Wasting away isn&rsquo;t what I fear for her, dear.&rdquo;</b> <i>He couldn&rsquo;t help but glance beyond the dark locks of his love and over to the locked door.

I\u2019m almost finished, I wanna get the lay of the blankets looking perfectly perfect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you- Are you drawing me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just looked so cute and sleep ruffled, like a sleepy cat, I had to. Now, don\u2019t move. I\u2019ll show you when I\u2019m finished.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlright\u2026\u201d Beau sighed but took the excuse to not get up just yet.

She had her hair pulled up in a bun on top of her head with two colored pencils sticking out of it. She grinned and waved Beau over.</p><p>Beau groaned but pushed herself up, throwing her feet out of the bed and letting them hit the ground heavily. She shuffled over and huffed as she dropped onto the bed beside the blue tiefling, resting her chin on her shoulder to look at the book laying open in her lap.</p><p>The drawing was immaculate, like the kind you\u2019d see in museums. There was no detail spared, perfect shading, flawless perspective. And it was of Beau drooling on her arm, her mouth hanging open comically with one arm folded awkwardly under her chest. Her hair was still half in-half out of the bun she\u2019d had it in yesterday. There was a yellowing bruise on her cheek bone and a swollen, healing cut on her bottom lip. </p><p>\u201cIs that really what I look like when I sleep?\u201d she asked, trying to keep the facial expressions to a minimum so that they couldn&rsquo;t be misinterpreted. The drawing was perhaps the most beautiful thing she\u2019d ever seen, her problem was just with the subject matter.</p><p>\u201cYep, that\u2019s the beautiful face I see every morning!\u201d</p><p>Beau sighed but smiled. \u201c<i>The drawing</i> is beautiful, Jes.
