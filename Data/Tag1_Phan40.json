Then if that wasn&rsquo;t bad enough, you had fans that would gatekeep, make blogs just to insult other fans behind their backs (god, the amount of blogs calling out other oc&rsquo;s as &ldquo;Mary Sue&rsquo;s&rdquo; was just awful), and spend their time belittling the newbies or people whose oc&rsquo;s they didn&rsquo;t like. It was awful. It was so so toxic, and I never felt safe. I have anxiety up the whazoo and it affected my mental health. So I remained a spectator instead for a while. The few times I tried to join in on the groups on DA I was either accepted, but only because my oc &ldquo;fit the requirements&rdquo; (aka was &ldquo;original&rdquo;, etc), or I was declined and belittled for the same things that other groups had accepted me for. (My da is Alex-Ghost if anyone is interested, I&rsquo;m not on much anymore, but I like to think it&rsquo;s my own personal art museum :3). But now? I see everyone making &ldquo;Ghost-sonas&rdquo; (thank whoever&rsquo;s up there we stopped calling them halfas, cause that was pretty problematic) and it makes me want to join in again. I see the weird little inside jokes you guys post, (like the one about oatmeal, and let&rsquo;s not get started on the vore thing), and I want to join in, I actually feel like it&rsquo;s safe again.

However, the BBC is temporarily being used as a film set for a new movie staring Hollywood \u2018It\u2019 star, Daniel Howell.

Phil has never felt so grateful to have everything put behind him so he was able to move on and begin to live his normal life again. He never thought he would ever miss his average life of going to work, coming home to Spike, finishing his assignments, and posting YouTube videos.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe\u2019s already posted two of them, not the ones he promised before. But he filmed two news ones and posted them. They didn\u2019t get as popular as his video with Dan, but looking at his twitter and his subscriber count said otherwise as he already has passed 2 million subscribers.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe feels a bit more overwhelmed now. A bit more cautious about how he shows himself to everyone. Phil feels the need to cover himself when he goes on the Tube or order out food to his flat instead of go and get it. He\u2019s even began asking PJ and Sophie and Martyn to come to his flat instead of him going to theirs.\u00a0</p><p>\tBut hopefully now, with Dan here, everything will feel a bit more settled once again like it had in LA.\u00a0</p><p>\tDan arrived really late in the night and he took a personal driver to Phil\u2019s flat. When they were sure no one was looking at them or for them, Dan jumped out the car and ran inside Phil\u2019s flat with his face covered. His driver brought his luggage to the door and Phil brought them inside.\u00a0</p><p>\tNow, just a few hours later, Dan was curled up on his bed, sleeping in the clothes he came here in. Phil was rolled on his side and smiling at him. Even though he knew Dan was stressed, he made it pretty clear when he fell onto his bed just soon as he arrived and asked for Spike to cuddle, in his sleeping form, he looked peaceful once again.\u00a0</p><p>\tSpike was currently the warm body laying between them, causing Phil to not actually cuddle Dan like he intended. Spike didn\u2019t seem to keen on moving either. When Phil tried to nudge him down the bed a bit, Spike just growled and refused to move so Phil left him.\u00a0\t</p><p>\tIt was nearly 4am and Phil could feel his eyelids beginning to droop a bit. He knew he had work in the morning but that didn\u2019t matter anymore because ehe knew when he got back, he\u2019d have Dan waiting for him. His premiere is this weekend and he needs to go a few fittings for his tux before then, but he says he has that covered so Phil doesn\u2019t worry.\u00a0\t</p><p>\tPhil shuts his eyes and rolls a little bit closer. Spike huffs in annoyance and sprawls out a bit more, his stubby legs kicking Phil in the stomach. Phil chuckles to himself and relaxes, willing himself to sleep now that Dan was snoring softly next to him.\u00a0</p><p>***</p><p>\t\u201cMy manager told me this was a bad move.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tDan\u2019s sitting on Phil\u2019s bed, eating the bowl of cereal that Phil had made for him. Phil offered to make him scrambled eggs but Dan said he needed sugar so Phil gave him Frosties instead. He was trying to get ready for work, but Dan was making it difficult. He had asked to shower first so Phil let him and then he waltzed back into the room completely naked and sat down on Phil\u2019s bed with just a towel covering his waist now.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWhat was a bad move?\u201d Phil asked, running his hands through his freshly dried hair, putting gel into it to push it into his quiff.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cStaying at your flat.\u201d Dan says, bringing up a spoonful to his mouth.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWhy was it a bad move?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tDan swallows and sets his bowl down on Phil\u2019s bedside table. \u201cMarianne said that it\u2019s gonna end badly if the paparazzi figure out where I am. It\u2019ll look bad if they discover I\u2019m staying at your flat.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cBut you should be allowed to stay where you want to?\u201d Phil says, opening up his closet doors and grabbing his jean jacket from its hanger.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cAnd I am.\u201d Dan countered. \u201cBut we\u2019ll just have to be careful.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil nods and begins to speak just as his phone alarm goes off and tells him that he has just 5 minutes before he has to leave for work. He lets out a sigh and turns off the alarm. He turns to Dan and walks over to the bed, leaning down to give him a kiss.\u00a0</p><p>\tDan reciprocates with no hesitation. It\u2019s just a quick peck, much different from the kisses they shared when Dan first arrived. Phil pulls away and then walks over to the door, ready to leave. \u201cI have to get going.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cThat\u2019s fine.\u201d Dan says. \u201cI have an appointment with my designer for my tux in a few hours so I need to get ready too.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI should be back around like four.\u201d Phil says, bending down on his way out to pet Spike who was sitting on the floor. \u201cDo you want me to pick up food when I\u2019m out for dinner?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cYou can.\u201d Dan says, stepping out of the room with his half-ate bowl of cereal. \u201cI\u2019m up for anything.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil flashes him a smile and moves to kiss him one more time. After a few shared kisses, he determined he was going to be late if he didn\u2019t get going so he grabbed his backpack and left.\u00a0</p><p>\tAs Phil walked to the tube station, he had to admit that he felt like he was cloud 9 right now. But even more than that, it also felt like he and Dan were acting like a proper couple who lived together. He got Dan a spare key to his flat so he could come and go as he pleased. He also trusts Dan with full control over everything inside the flat and Spike as well.\u00a0</p><p>\tSpike has already grown really fond of Dan which Phil is so happy about. He knew Spike was a loveable little guy and that he loved every person he met, but he was still nervous about having Dan being in the flat. But Spike was completely fine with Dan and Phil is even a bit jealous since Spike seems to want to spend all of the time with Dan when he is around.\u00a0</p><p>\tAt the BBC, PJ was already at his desk when he walked in and Gemma was sitting with him, a chair pulled up to the side. They were talking close to each other, almost like gossiping, and as soon as Phil sat down his backpack and unzipped it, they both peaked their heads up at him.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil felt a bit weird about it, but he didn\u2019t question it. If PJ and Gemma were having a private conversation, he wasn\u2019t one to butt in and try and figure out what they were talking about. However, the way that they kept looking at him every so often gave him the uneasy, sinking feeling that they were talking about him.\u00a0</p><p>\tEventually, PJ caved and looked up and spoke up to him. \u201cDid Dan get in alright?\u201d He asked.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil looked up from his laptop and nodded. \u201cYeah, he got in sometime last night.\u201d He answers.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cThat\u2019s good! Glad he wasn\u2019t bombarded or anything at the airport.\u201d PJ says, leaning back in his chair and Gemma following suit in hers.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWhat are you really wanting to ask, Peej?\u201d Phil asked. \u201cI know you want to ask something.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPJ shook his head. \u201cOh, no. I actually don\u2019t have anything I really want to say other than I just hope that you guys can have your privacy.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cMe too.\u201d Phil finds himself saying as he swallows the knot in his throat.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cYou two deserve it.\u201d Gemma chimes in. \u201cI know I wasn\u2019t the easiest person to talk to when you first came back to work after your first rendezvous with Dan but\u2026you two deserve happiness and you two deserve to have your privacy like anyone else.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil was actually really flushed to hear that. Gemma was right when she said that she hadn\u2019t been the easiest to be around but that was completely true. Phil called it jealousy that he was growing closer to Dan and she still had a crush on him. But there were days when he\u2019d walk into the office and she would leave and not say a word to him. Other days, she would ask him about what Dan smelled like\u2015Phil always said warm, which was weird, but Phil understood in a weird way.\u00a0</p><p>\tGemma had began to open up to him again the last week or so and Phil was okay with grateful for that because even though they were never more than just co-workers, he didn\u2019t like the idea of someone close to him being upset that he was dating Dan.\u00a0</p><p>\tThey eventually all ended up in a conversation about their new projects that they were working on and Phil mentioned how he posted a new video to his YouTube channel. Both Gemma and PJ seemed interested in that so he spent a good portion of their morning showing them his video and promoting his channel to them.\u00a0</p><p>\tFor lunch, they all went out to get lunch together at the closest Costa and then they brought it back to the office and continued their conversations. Phil ended up telling PJ and Gemma about how Dan had his big movie premiere in a few nights and it worried him because this was Dan\u2019s first official step into the spotlight since their paparazzi problems.\u00a0</p><p>\tBy the end of their shifts, they all clocked out and left and went their own ways for the night. Phil told PJ he would let him know if Dan was down for dinner one night with him and Sophie.\u00a0</p><p>\tOn the way back to his flat, Dan had texted him and told him he was running a bit behind at his designers studio for his fitting and he might be a couple hours later than normal getting back. Phil didn\u2019t mind so he got back to the flat and began to prepare a dinner with some of the food he had in his fridge.\u00a0</p><p>\tWith Spike running around his feet, he eventually ended up with some pasta dish with pre-packaged sauce that he warmed up in a pot. But he put all of it together and when Dan got back to his flat, his hoodie up and his sunglasses on, Phil couldn\u2019t miss the smile on his face when he smelled the food.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cDid you cook?\u201d Dan asked, shucking off his backpack onto Phil\u2019s couch and unzipping his hoodie, shrugging it off as well. He stepped up to the kitchen and grabbed one of the plates that Phil had prepared. \u201cYou didn\u2019t have to do this.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI wanted to.\u201d Phil says. \u201cI never cooked enough on my own and now I have you here so I thought this is as good of a time as any.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tDan walked over to him and kissed him on the cheek, his lips pressing firmly on his skin. \u201cThank you.\u201d Dan whispers. \u201cI\u2019ve never had a boyfriend cook me dinner before.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cNever?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tDan shook his head. \u201cGonna be honest, Phil. I\u2019ve never had a boyfriend care about me as much as you do and at times, it throws me off but most of the time, I love it so much.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil puts his arm around Dan\u2019s waist and pulls him close, pressing a kiss to his lips. When they separated, they made their way to his breakfast bar and sat down and ate their dinner. When they were done, Phil took care of the dishes by rinsing them off in the sink and then leaving for tomorrow.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe was feeling a bit tired. It probably had to do with the fact that he didn\u2019t sleep well the night before. He stayed up waiting for Dan and then once Dan was here, he was too busy looking at him to want to shut his eyes and not see him anymore.\u00a0</p><p>\tDan seemed tired too. As they were resting on the couch, Dan had begun to fall asleep so Phil settled back and let Dan fall asleep on his chest under a blanket that was wrapped around them. Spike laid on the end of the couch, curled up and sleeping as well.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil had the anime that they were watching playing softly in the background and his eyes were beginning to shut too when his phone went off on the side of the couch and jolted him up.

Phil has never felt so grateful to have everything put behind him so he was able to move on and begin to live his normal life again. He never thought he would ever miss his average life of going to work, coming home to Spike, finishing his assignments, and posting YouTube videos.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe\u2019s already posted two of them, not the ones he promised before. But he filmed two news ones and posted them. They didn\u2019t get as popular as his video with Dan, but looking at his twitter and his subscriber count said otherwise as he already has passed 2 million subscribers.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe feels a bit more overwhelmed now. A bit more cautious about how he shows himself to everyone. Phil feels the need to cover himself when he goes on the Tube or order out food to his flat instead of go and get it. He\u2019s even began asking PJ and Sophie and Martyn to come to his flat instead of him going to theirs.\u00a0</p><p>\tBut hopefully now, with Dan here, everything will feel a bit more settled once again like it had in LA.\u00a0</p><p>\tDan arrived really late in the night and he took a personal driver to Phil\u2019s flat. When they were sure no one was looking at them or for them, Dan jumped out the car and ran inside Phil\u2019s flat with his face covered. His driver brought his luggage to the door and Phil brought them inside.\u00a0</p><p>\tNow, just a few hours later, Dan was curled up on his bed, sleeping in the clothes he came here in. Phil was rolled on his side and smiling at him. Even though he knew Dan was stressed, he made it pretty clear when he fell onto his bed just soon as he arrived and asked for Spike to cuddle, in his sleeping form, he looked peaceful once again.\u00a0</p><p>\tSpike was currently the warm body laying between them, causing Phil to not actually cuddle Dan like he intended. Spike didn\u2019t seem to keen on moving either. When Phil tried to nudge him down the bed a bit, Spike just growled and refused to move so Phil left him.\u00a0\t</p><p>\tIt was nearly 4am and Phil could feel his eyelids beginning to droop a bit. He knew he had work in the morning but that didn\u2019t matter anymore because ehe knew when he got back, he\u2019d have Dan waiting for him. His premiere is this weekend and he needs to go a few fittings for his tux before then, but he says he has that covered so Phil doesn\u2019t worry.\u00a0\t</p><p>\tPhil shuts his eyes and rolls a little bit closer. Spike huffs in annoyance and sprawls out a bit more, his stubby legs kicking Phil in the stomach. Phil chuckles to himself and relaxes, willing himself to sleep now that Dan was snoring softly next to him.\u00a0</p><p>***</p><p>\t\u201cMy manager told me this was a bad move.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tDan\u2019s sitting on Phil\u2019s bed, eating the bowl of cereal that Phil had made for him. Phil offered to make him scrambled eggs but Dan said he needed sugar so Phil gave him Frosties instead. He was trying to get ready for work, but Dan was making it difficult. He had asked to shower first so Phil let him and then he waltzed back into the room completely naked and sat down on Phil\u2019s bed with just a towel covering his waist now.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWhat was a bad move?\u201d Phil asked, running his hands through his freshly dried hair, putting gel into it to push it into his quiff.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cStaying at your flat.\u201d Dan says, bringing up a spoonful to his mouth.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWhy was it a bad move?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tDan swallows and sets his bowl down on Phil\u2019s bedside table. \u201cMarianne said that it\u2019s gonna end badly if the paparazzi figure out where I am. It\u2019ll look bad if they discover I\u2019m staying at your flat.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cBut you should be allowed to stay where you want to?\u201d Phil says, opening up his closet doors and grabbing his jean jacket from its hanger.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cAnd I am.\u201d Dan countered. \u201cBut we\u2019ll just have to be careful.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil nods and begins to speak just as his phone alarm goes off and tells him that he has just 5 minutes before he has to leave for work. He lets out a sigh and turns off the alarm. He turns to Dan and walks over to the bed, leaning down to give him a kiss.\u00a0</p><p>\tDan reciprocates with no hesitation. It\u2019s just a quick peck, much different from the kisses they shared when Dan first arrived. Phil pulls away and then walks over to the door, ready to leave. \u201cI have to get going.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cThat\u2019s fine.\u201d Dan says. \u201cI have an appointment with my designer for my tux in a few hours so I need to get ready too.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI should be back around like four.\u201d Phil says, bending down on his way out to pet Spike who was sitting on the floor. \u201cDo you want me to pick up food when I\u2019m out for dinner?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cYou can.\u201d Dan says, stepping out of the room with his half-ate bowl of cereal. \u201cI\u2019m up for anything.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil flashes him a smile and moves to kiss him one more time. After a few shared kisses, he determined he was going to be late if he didn\u2019t get going so he grabbed his backpack and left.\u00a0</p><p>\tAs Phil walked to the tube station, he had to admit that he felt like he was cloud 9 right now. But even more than that, it also felt like he and Dan were acting like a proper couple who lived together. He got Dan a spare key to his flat so he could come and go as he pleased. He also trusts Dan with full control over everything inside the flat and Spike as well.\u00a0</p><p>\tSpike has already grown really fond of Dan which Phil is so happy about. He knew Spike was a loveable little guy and that he loved every person he met, but he was still nervous about having Dan being in the flat. But Spike was completely fine with Dan and Phil is even a bit jealous since Spike seems to want to spend all of the time with Dan when he is around.\u00a0</p><p>\tAt the BBC, PJ was already at his desk when he walked in and Gemma was sitting with him, a chair pulled up to the side. They were talking close to each other, almost like gossiping, and as soon as Phil sat down his backpack and unzipped it, they both peaked their heads up at him.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil felt a bit weird about it, but he didn\u2019t question it. If PJ and Gemma were having a private conversation, he wasn\u2019t one to butt in and try and figure out what they were talking about. However, the way that they kept looking at him every so often gave him the uneasy, sinking feeling that they were talking about him.\u00a0</p><p>\tEventually, PJ caved and looked up and spoke up to him. \u201cDid Dan get in alright?\u201d He asked.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil looked up from his laptop and nodded. \u201cYeah, he got in sometime last night.\u201d He answers.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cThat\u2019s good! Glad he wasn\u2019t bombarded or anything at the airport.\u201d PJ says, leaning back in his chair and Gemma following suit in hers.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWhat are you really wanting to ask, Peej?\u201d Phil asked. \u201cI know you want to ask something.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPJ shook his head. \u201cOh, no. I actually don\u2019t have anything I really want to say other than I just hope that you guys can have your privacy.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cMe too.\u201d Phil finds himself saying as he swallows the knot in his throat.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cYou two deserve it.\u201d Gemma chimes in. \u201cI know I wasn\u2019t the easiest person to talk to when you first came back to work after your first rendezvous with Dan but\u2026you two deserve happiness and you two deserve to have your privacy like anyone else.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil was actually really flushed to hear that. Gemma was right when she said that she hadn\u2019t been the easiest to be around but that was completely true. Phil called it jealousy that he was growing closer to Dan and she still had a crush on him. But there were days when he\u2019d walk into the office and she would leave and not say a word to him. Other days, she would ask him about what Dan smelled like\u2015Phil always said warm, which was weird, but Phil understood in a weird way.\u00a0</p><p>\tGemma had began to open up to him again the last week or so and Phil was okay with grateful for that because even though they were never more than just co-workers, he didn\u2019t like the idea of someone close to him being upset that he was dating Dan.\u00a0</p><p>\tThey eventually all ended up in a conversation about their new projects that they were working on and Phil mentioned how he posted a new video to his YouTube channel. Both Gemma and PJ seemed interested in that so he spent a good portion of their morning showing them his video and promoting his channel to them.\u00a0</p><p>\tFor lunch, they all went out to get lunch together at the closest Costa and then they brought it back to the office and continued their conversations. Phil ended up telling PJ and Gemma about how Dan had his big movie premiere in a few nights and it worried him because this was Dan\u2019s first official step into the spotlight since their paparazzi problems.\u00a0</p><p>\tBy the end of their shifts, they all clocked out and left and went their own ways for the night. Phil told PJ he would let him know if Dan was down for dinner one night with him and Sophie.\u00a0</p><p>\tOn the way back to his flat, Dan had texted him and told him he was running a bit behind at his designers studio for his fitting and he might be a couple hours later than normal getting back. Phil didn\u2019t mind so he got back to the flat and began to prepare a dinner with some of the food he had in his fridge.\u00a0</p><p>\tWith Spike running around his feet, he eventually ended up with some pasta dish with pre-packaged sauce that he warmed up in a pot. But he put all of it together and when Dan got back to his flat, his hoodie up and his sunglasses on, Phil couldn\u2019t miss the smile on his face when he smelled the food.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cDid you cook?\u201d Dan asked, shucking off his backpack onto Phil\u2019s couch and unzipping his hoodie, shrugging it off as well. He stepped up to the kitchen and grabbed one of the plates that Phil had prepared. \u201cYou didn\u2019t have to do this.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI wanted to.\u201d Phil says. \u201cI never cooked enough on my own and now I have you here so I thought this is as good of a time as any.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tDan walked over to him and kissed him on the cheek, his lips pressing firmly on his skin. \u201cThank you.\u201d Dan whispers. \u201cI\u2019ve never had a boyfriend cook me dinner before.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cNever?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tDan shook his head. \u201cGonna be honest, Phil. I\u2019ve never had a boyfriend care about me as much as you do and at times, it throws me off but most of the time, I love it so much.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil puts his arm around Dan\u2019s waist and pulls him close, pressing a kiss to his lips. When they separated, they made their way to his breakfast bar and sat down and ate their dinner. When they were done, Phil took care of the dishes by rinsing them off in the sink and then leaving for tomorrow.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe was feeling a bit tired. It probably had to do with the fact that he didn\u2019t sleep well the night before. He stayed up waiting for Dan and then once Dan was here, he was too busy looking at him to want to shut his eyes and not see him anymore.\u00a0</p><p>\tDan seemed tired too. As they were resting on the couch, Dan had begun to fall asleep so Phil settled back and let Dan fall asleep on his chest under a blanket that was wrapped around them. Spike laid on the end of the couch, curled up and sleeping as well.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil had the anime that they were watching playing softly in the background and his eyes were beginning to shut too when his phone went off on the side of the couch and jolted him up. Dan groaned a bit in his sleep but then pressed further onto Phil\u2019s chest and snuggled back down. Phil looked at the message and he read it was from his brother.\u00a0</p><p>\t<b>Martyn: </b>Did you know about this?\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil opens up the message with the image attached and it\u2019s a screenshot taken from Dan\u2019s Instagram story that said it was posted 13 hours ago. It was a photo of Dan with Spike, clearly laying in Phil\u2019s bed, with the caption \u201cMy new snuggle buddy\u201d.\u00a0</p>",

Phil pulls away and then walks over to the door, ready to leave. \u201cI have to get going.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cThat\u2019s fine.\u201d Dan says. \u201cI have an appointment with my designer for my tux in a few hours so I need to get ready too.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI should be back around like four.\u201d Phil says, bending down on his way out to pet Spike who was sitting on the floor. \u201cDo you want me to pick up food when I\u2019m out for dinner?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cYou can.\u201d Dan says, stepping out of the room with his half-ate bowl of cereal. \u201cI\u2019m up for anything.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil flashes him a smile and moves to kiss him one more time. After a few shared kisses, he determined he was going to be late if he didn\u2019t get going so he grabbed his backpack and left.\u00a0</p><p>\tAs Phil walked to the tube station, he had to admit that he felt like he was cloud 9 right now. But even more than that, it also felt like he and Dan were acting like a proper couple who lived together. He got Dan a spare key to his flat so he could come and go as he pleased. He also trusts Dan with full control over everything inside the flat and Spike as well.\u00a0</p><p>\tSpike has already grown really fond of Dan which Phil is so happy about. He knew Spike was a loveable little guy and that he loved every person he met, but he was still nervous about having Dan being in the flat. But Spike was completely fine with Dan and Phil is even a bit jealous since Spike seems to want to spend all of the time with Dan when he is around.\u00a0</p><p>\tAt the BBC, PJ was already at his desk when he walked in and Gemma was sitting with him, a chair pulled up to the side. They were talking close to each other, almost like gossiping, and as soon as Phil sat down his backpack and unzipped it, they both peaked their heads up at him.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil felt a bit weird about it, but he didn\u2019t question it. If PJ and Gemma were having a private conversation, he wasn\u2019t one to butt in and try and figure out what they were talking about. However, the way that they kept looking at him every so often gave him the uneasy, sinking feeling that they were talking about him.\u00a0</p><p>\tEventually, PJ caved and looked up and spoke up to him. \u201cDid Dan get in alright?\u201d He asked.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil looked up from his laptop and nodded. \u201cYeah, he got in sometime last night.\u201d He answers.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cThat\u2019s good! Glad he wasn\u2019t bombarded or anything at the airport.\u201d PJ says, leaning back in his chair and Gemma following suit in hers.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWhat are you really wanting to ask, Peej?\u201d Phil asked. \u201cI know you want to ask something.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPJ shook his head. \u201cOh, no. I actually don\u2019t have anything I really want to say other than I just hope that you guys can have your privacy.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cMe too.\u201d Phil finds himself saying as he swallows the knot in his throat.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cYou two deserve it.\u201d Gemma chimes in. \u201cI know I wasn\u2019t the easiest person to talk to when you first came back to work after your first rendezvous with Dan but\u2026you two deserve happiness and you two deserve to have your privacy like anyone else.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil was actually really flushed to hear that. Gemma was right when she said that she hadn\u2019t been the easiest to be around but that was completely true. Phil called it jealousy that he was growing closer to Dan and she still had a crush on him. But there were days when he\u2019d walk into the office and she would leave and not say a word to him. Other days, she would ask him about what Dan smelled like\u2015Phil always said warm, which was weird, but Phil understood in a weird way.\u00a0</p><p>\tGemma had began to open up to him again the last week or so and Phil was okay with grateful for that because even though they were never more than just co-workers, he didn\u2019t like the idea of someone close to him being upset that he was dating Dan.\u00a0</p><p>\tThey eventually all ended up in a conversation about their new projects that they were working on and Phil mentioned how he posted a new video to his YouTube channel. Both Gemma and PJ seemed interested in that so he spent a good portion of their morning showing them his video and promoting his channel to them.\u00a0</p><p>\tFor lunch, they all went out to get lunch together at the closest Costa and then they brought it back to the office and continued their conversations. Phil ended up telling PJ and Gemma about how Dan had his big movie premiere in a few nights and it worried him because this was Dan\u2019s first official step into the spotlight since their paparazzi problems.\u00a0</p><p>\tBy the end of their shifts, they all clocked out and left and went their own ways for the night. Phil told PJ he would let him know if Dan was down for dinner one night with him and Sophie.\u00a0</p><p>\tOn the way back to his flat, Dan had texted him and told him he was running a bit behind at his designers studio for his fitting and he might be a couple hours later than normal getting back. Phil didn\u2019t mind so he got back to the flat and began to prepare a dinner with some of the food he had in his fridge.\u00a0</p><p>\tWith Spike running around his feet, he eventually ended up with some pasta dish with pre-packaged sauce that he warmed up in a pot. But he put all of it together and when Dan got back to his flat, his hoodie up and his sunglasses on, Phil couldn\u2019t miss the smile on his face when he smelled the food.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cDid you cook?\u201d Dan asked, shucking off his backpack onto Phil\u2019s couch and unzipping his hoodie, shrugging it off as well. He stepped up to the kitchen and grabbed one of the plates that Phil had prepared. \u201cYou didn\u2019t have to do this.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI wanted to.\u201d Phil says. \u201cI never cooked enough on my own and now I have you here so I thought this is as good of a time as any.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tDan walked over to him and kissed him on the cheek, his lips pressing firmly on his skin. \u201cThank you.\u201d Dan whispers. \u201cI\u2019ve never had a boyfriend cook me dinner before.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cNever?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tDan shook his head. \u201cGonna be honest, Phil. I\u2019ve never had a boyfriend care about me as much as you do and at times, it throws me off but most of the time, I love it so much.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil puts his arm around Dan\u2019s waist and pulls him close, pressing a kiss to his lips. When they separated, they made their way to his breakfast bar and sat down and ate their dinner. When they were done, Phil took care of the dishes by rinsing them off in the sink and then leaving for tomorrow.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe was feeling a bit tired. It probably had to do with the fact that he didn\u2019t sleep well the night before. He stayed up waiting for Dan and then once Dan was here, he was too busy looking at him to want to shut his eyes and not see him anymore.\u00a0</p><p>\tDan seemed tired too. As they were resting on the couch, Dan had begun to fall asleep so Phil settled back and let Dan fall asleep on his chest under a blanket that was wrapped around them. Spike laid on the end of the couch, curled up and sleeping as well.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil had the anime that they were watching playing softly in the background and his eyes were beginning to shut too when his phone went off on the side of the couch and jolted him up. Dan groaned a bit in his sleep but then pressed further onto Phil\u2019s chest and snuggled back down. Phil looked at the message and he read it was from his brother.\u00a0</p><p>\t<b>Martyn: </b>Did you know about this?\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil opens up the message with the image attached and it\u2019s a screenshot taken from Dan\u2019s Instagram story that said it was posted 13 hours ago.

Phil has never felt so grateful to have everything put behind him so he was able to move on and begin to live his normal life again. He never thought he would ever miss his average life of going to work, coming home to Spike, finishing his assignments, and posting YouTube videos.&nbsp;</p><p>\tHe&rsquo;s already posted two of them, not the ones he promised before. But he filmed two news ones and posted them. They didn&rsquo;t get as popular as his video with Dan, but looking at his twitter and his subscriber count said otherwise as he already has passed 2 million subscribers.&nbsp;</p><p>\tHe feels a bit more overwhelmed now. A bit more cautious about how he shows himself to everyone. Phil feels the need to cover himself when he goes on the Tube or order out food to his flat instead of go and get it. He&rsquo;s even began asking PJ and Sophie and Martyn to come to his flat instead of him going to theirs.&nbsp;</p><p>\tBut hopefully now, with Dan here, everything will feel a bit more settled once again like it had in LA.&nbsp;</p><p>\tDan arrived really late in the night and he took a personal driver to Phil&rsquo;s flat. When they were sure no one was looking at them or for them, Dan jumped out the car and ran inside Phil&rsquo;s flat with his face covered. His driver brought his luggage to the door and Phil brought them inside.&nbsp;</p><p>\tNow, just a few hours later, Dan was curled up on his bed, sleeping in the clothes he came here in. Phil was rolled on his side and smiling at him. Even though he knew Dan was stressed, he made it pretty clear when he fell onto his bed just soon as he arrived and asked for Spike to cuddle, in his sleeping form, he looked peaceful once again.&nbsp;</p><p>\tSpike was currently the warm body laying between them, causing Phil to not actually cuddle Dan like he intended. Spike didn&rsquo;t seem to keen on moving either. When Phil tried to nudge him down the bed a bit, Spike just growled and refused to move so Phil left him.&nbsp;\t</p><p>\tIt was nearly 4am and Phil could feel his eyelids beginning to droop a bit. He knew he had work in the morning but that didn&rsquo;t matter anymore because ehe knew when he got back, he&rsquo;d have Dan waiting for him. His premiere is this weekend and he needs to go a few fittings for his tux before then, but he says he has that covered so Phil doesn&rsquo;t worry.&nbsp;\t</p><p>\tPhil shuts his eyes and rolls a little bit closer. Spike huffs in annoyance and sprawls out a bit more, his stubby legs kicking Phil in the stomach. Phil chuckles to himself and relaxes, willing himself to sleep now that Dan was snoring softly next to him.&nbsp;</p><p>***</p><p>\t&ldquo;My manager told me this was a bad move.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tDan&rsquo;s sitting on Phil&rsquo;s bed, eating the bowl of cereal that Phil had made for him. Phil offered to make him scrambled eggs but Dan said he needed sugar so Phil gave him Frosties instead. He was trying to get ready for work, but Dan was making it difficult. He had asked to shower first so Phil let him and then he waltzed back into the room completely naked and sat down on Phil&rsquo;s bed with just a towel covering his waist now.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;What was a bad move?&rdquo; Phil asked, running his hands through his freshly dried hair, putting gel into it to push it into his quiff.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Staying at your flat.&rdquo; Dan says, bringing up a spoonful to his mouth.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Why was it a bad move?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tDan swallows and sets his bowl down on Phil&rsquo;s bedside table. &ldquo;Marianne said that it&rsquo;s gonna end badly if the paparazzi figure out where I am. It&rsquo;ll look bad if they discover I&rsquo;m staying at your flat.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;But you should be allowed to stay where you want to?&rdquo; Phil says, opening up his closet doors and grabbing his jean jacket from its hanger.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;And I am.&rdquo; Dan countered. &ldquo;But we&rsquo;ll just have to be careful.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil nods and begins to speak just as his phone alarm goes off and tells him that he has just 5 minutes before he has to leave for work. He lets out a sigh and turns off the alarm. He turns to Dan and walks over to the bed, leaning down to give him a kiss.&nbsp;</p><p>\tDan reciprocates with no hesitation. It&rsquo;s just a quick peck, much different from the kisses they shared when Dan first arrived. Phil pulls away and then walks over to the door, ready to leave. &ldquo;I have to get going.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;That&rsquo;s fine.&rdquo; Dan says. &ldquo;I have an appointment with my designer for my tux in a few hours so I need to get ready too.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;I should be back around like four.&rdquo; Phil says, bending down on his way out to pet Spike who was sitting on the floor. &ldquo;Do you want me to pick up food when I&rsquo;m out for dinner?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;You can.&rdquo; Dan says, stepping out of the room with his half-ate bowl of cereal. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m up for anything.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil flashes him a smile and moves to kiss him one more time.
