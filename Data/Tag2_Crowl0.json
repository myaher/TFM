It was an activity he was both naturally suited for and \nvery well practised in. On this particular occasion he was expressing \nhis fretfullness by making numerous cups of tea and allowing them to \ngrow cold, picking up and reading the first few pages of several \nabsolutely blameless books before setting them aside, and glancing \nfrequently at the telephone and the bell above the shop door, both of \nwhich adamantly refused to ring.<a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/new#sdfootnote1sym\"><sup>1</sup></a><br/></p><p>It wasn&rsquo;t as though he had any reason to worry, he told himself firmly. Crowley hadn&rsquo;t said he\n was going to come over today, they certainly hadn&rsquo;t had any plans. It \nwas just that&hellip;well, it was just that since the notpocalypse Crowley \nhad made a habit of popping in to see him of an afternoon. Most \nafternoons. All afternoons. And now it was well after teatime and \nheading towards dinner and not a word. Surely heaven or hell couldn&rsquo;t \nhave got a hold of him. They&rsquo;d both been sure they&rsquo;d be left alone for \nthe time being at least. And if either side had figured out their little body switcheroo surely they would have descended on both of them.</p><p>He took a deep breath and carefully laid the book he had been trying to focus on aside. Really it wasn&rsquo;t like he should expect Crowley to just show up. In the beginning they&rsquo;d gone centuries without seeing each other after all.<a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/new#sdfootnote2sym\"><sup>2</sup></a>\n But centuries had gradually turned into decades then years and in \nrecent times what with young Warlock, and then the apocalypse and being \non their own side and everything, well, they&rsquo;d practically been living \nin each other&rsquo;s pockets. </p><p>It\n would make sense that Crowley might want some time to himself. He only \nwished, rather selfishly, that the dear boy had just said something. \nHe&rsquo;d rather thought they were heading towards something new here. \nRedefining the nature of their relationship, as it were. </p><p>A horrible thought suddenly struck him. If that was what\n they were doing hadn&rsquo;t he been relying on Crowley to make all the \neffort? Here he was waiting for Crowley to come over or call&hellip;maybe he \nhadn&rsquo;t been showing enough commitment of his own? Maybe Aziraphale \nhadn&rsquo;t been appreciating him enough, and now Crowley thought his \npresence was unwelcome and he was going to stop popping round and get \ninto one of his moods again and do something unfathomably silly, like \nsleep for another century,or move to America and cut off all his lovely \nhair again, or find whatever new intoxicants the humans were using and \noverindulge. And heaven&hellip;no-one only knew whether he&rsquo;d remember that \nbeing discorporated wouldn&rsquo;t just mean a quick trip down below for some \nunpleasantness and paperwork in order to get a new body.<a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/new#sdfootnote3sym\"><sup>3</sup></a><br/></p><p>At\n that thought Aziraphale snatched up his coat, ran out the door and \nhailed an idling cab whose previous fare had miraculously decided to get\n out and walk the rest of the way. <br/></p><p>*<br/></p><p><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/new#sdfootnote1anc\">1</a>Actually\n the shop bell had rung twice that day, but on both occasions it had \nproved to be a customer which was the last thing the bookshop needed.</p><p><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/new#sdfootnote2anc\">2</a>This\n wasn&rsquo;t quite true, in the Beginning they hadn&rsquo;t known each other at \nall, and in the time immediately after the Garden, which was more what \nAziraphale had in mind, their temptations and blessings had been very \nmuch focused on the one existing family and so they&rsquo;d seen each other \nnearly every single day, though they&rsquo;d rarely exchanged more than the \nodd embarrassed nod.</p><p><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/new#sdfootnote3anc\">3</a>You\n might think that this is rather a lot of panic and suppositions over \nsomeone who has only been &lsquo;missing&rsquo; for a few hours. But Aziraphale had \nhad a very trying time of it lately and the effects of adrenaline take \nlonger to fade in those of angelic stock than in humans.</p><p>*</p><p>He\n had been to Crowley&rsquo;s flat before of course. Well. Once. The night \nafter armageddon&rsquo;t. But even if he hadn&rsquo;t he&rsquo;d have been able to find it\n by following his awareness of Crowley through London, though admittedly\n that particular method of navigation would have been difficult to \nexplain to the cabbie. The door was locked and he knocked a couple of \ntimes before walking in, rationalising to himself that he was just \nchecking that everything was as it should be. </p><p>\u201cCrowley?\u201d\n he called from the hall, shifting uncomfortably as a wave of heat and \nhumidity hit him. \u201cIt&rsquo;s me, dear. I thought I&rsquo;d see if you wanted to get\n dinner?\u201d </p><p>There was no answer. He moved deeper inside, telling himself that he wasn&rsquo;t really intruding,\n after all they&rsquo;d known each other for 6000 years and Crowley was always\n popping into the bookshop unannounced. Turnabout was fair play and all \nthat. It really was very warm in here. Perhaps Crowley was just taking a\n nap. He always did like the temperature far too high, old serpent that \nhe was. </p><p>Giving\n the spot on the floor where once had lain the foul remains of a demon \nand a thermos of holy water a wide berth and an unhappy grimace<a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/new#sdfootnote4sym\"><sup>1</sup></a>,\n he followed a sense of fear and anxiety through a closed door at the \nend of the hall and was confronted with a wall of green. Oh, yes, of \ncourse, Crowley&rsquo;s plants. Gardening was one of those human \npreoccupations that Crowley had always been partial to, like sleep or \nmusic or gender. Aziraphale didn&rsquo;t exactly understand it, but he had \nonce read that having separate interests was very important so that was \nalright. He didn&rsquo;t have to. </p><p>Well,\n this seemed to be where the anxiety was originating from anyway. He \nfrowned at the money tree trembling in his face. \u201cHonestly, what does he\n do to you?\u201d he asked, going on to murmur a litany of soothing words. In\n response the plant promptly shuddered and produced a shiny red apple, \nalmost bending in two beneath its weight. \u201cYes, well&hellip;\u201d Aziraphale \nlooked aside in embarrassment. It wasn&rsquo;t the sort of thing he&rsquo;d ever \nbeen crass enough to bring up, but inanimate objects tended to take on a\n life of their own around Crowley. The Bentley had its own tastes and \nOpinions for a start, and there had been that viol a few centuries back \nwhich Crowley had been so fond of and which Aziraphale would swear had \nbit him one night after he&rsquo;d misguidedly plucked a string. It wasn&rsquo;t \nlike Crowley went around whispering 'Let there be life&rsquo; all over the \nplace, it was just that he could get a little overfocused on his \nobsessions.<a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/new#sdfootnote5sym\"><sup>2</sup></a><br/></p><p>\u201cAnyway,\u201d\n he said brightly, dusting off his hands and getting back to the \noriginal point. \u201cCrowley! Crowley, dear boy, are you in?\u201d He tried \nanother door and found himself in a study of sorts with&hellip;was that a \nthrone? He pressed his fingers up against his lips, suppressing a \nridiculous. How absolutely ridiculous, he thought fondly. And how typical. </p><p>There\n was a slight noise behind him and he turned quickly to see a twelve \nfoot long black snake with a bright red hood inches away from his face.</p><p>With a yelp the angel leapt back about three feet. With a hiss, so did the demon.</p><p>\u201cReally, my dear,\u201d Aziraphale said, brushing off his lapels carefully. \u201cYou startled me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSsstartled you?\u201d Crowley exclaimed, surprisingly expressively for a snake. \u201cI&rsquo;m ssorry, whosse home are we in again? I wass assleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\n well.\u201d Now that he was actually here in front of a Crowley who was \nevidently unharmed and wasn&rsquo;t noticeably pining away he felt rather \nsilly. \u201cI thought we&rsquo;d been going out this afternoon and when you didn&rsquo;t\n show up I thought maybe I should meet you here.\u201d</p><p>Crowley reared back, his tongue flickering agitatedly. \u201cWe didn&rsquo;t have planss, did we? I would have remembered plansss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d\n Aziraphale said stiffly, somewhere between the point of wishing himself\n far away and actually miracling it. \u201cI suppose I just rather assumed.\u201d</p><p>They stared at each other for a long moment.</p><p>Eventually Aziraphale coughed. \u201cWell. I won&rsquo;t intrude any further,\u201d he said, turning to walk away.</p><p>\u201cDon&rsquo;t!\u201d\n Crowley transformed in an instant, hand reaching out to lightly grasp \nAziraphale&rsquo;s sleeve. \u201cI&rsquo;m sorry, angel. I didn&rsquo;t mean to chase you away.\n I was just surprised to see you is all. But not all surprises are bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell.\u201d Aziraphale felt his cheeks pinken. \u201cThat&rsquo;s alright then. Shall we have some wine?\u201d</p><p>*<br/></p><p><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/new#sdfootnote4anc\">1</a>Aziraphale had been the one to carefully miracle it away that night. But he would always know it had been there.</p><p><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/new#sdfootnote5anc\">2</a>Aziraphale\n did have the grace to be aware he was being something of a hypocrite \nhere, but in his own defense his books had never expressed any emotions \nof their own.<a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/new#sdfootnote6sym\">3</a></p><p><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/new#sdfootnote6anc\">3</a>They did tend to take on the emotional aura of those around them, however. In most cases Aziraphale&rsquo;s collection reflected love.</p><p>*<br/></p><p>A\n few moments later found them on a leather sofa that was impossibly \ncomfier than it looked, drinking a vintage that was rather superior to \nthe one it had been when Aziraphale had bought it.</p><p>\u201cI didn&rsquo;t know you were scared of snakes, angel,\u201d Crowley said, pouring them another glass.</p><p>He sat up indignantly. \u201cI am not! Why would anyone be scared of snakes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDunno. But lots of humans are. Think maybe it&rsquo;s because they think all snakes are poisonous?\u201d</p><p>Aziraphale\n quickly glanced towards him and equally quickly looked aside. \u201cWell, my\n dear, that would only be a problem were I planning on eating you.\u201d</p><p>He hid his smile behind his wine glass as Crowley choked.</p><p>\u201cWhat have you been doing today anyway,\u201d he asked before the demon had a chance to fully recover.</p><p>The light vanished from Crowley&rsquo;s face in an instant. \u201cOh, this and that. Thinking, mostly.\u201d</p><p>Brooding, Aziraphale mentally translated. \u201cThere&rsquo;s nothing&hellip;wrong, is there?\u201d he asked hesitantly. \u201cYou haven&rsquo;t heard from&hellip;\u201d He gestured vaguely downwards.</p><p>\u201cNo. No, nothing like that, &rsquo;s just&hellip;\u201d He tilted his head back to look at the ceiling. \u201cDo you think Warlock&rsquo;s doing okay?\u201d</p><p>Aziraphale blinked. He hadn&rsquo;t been expecting that. \u201cOh, I&rsquo;m sure he is. Why wouldn&rsquo;t he be, after all?\u201d</p><p>Crowley\n drained his glass. \u201cWell, I mean, it&rsquo;s just that I&rsquo;d \u2013 we&rsquo;d \u2013 always \nbeen there for him since before he can remember, and now we&rsquo;re not. And \nyou know what his parents are like.\u201d</p><p>He\n nodded, even though in his experience Mr and Mrs Dowling had been \nperfectly unobjectionable. His lips twitched. \u201cYou&rsquo;re worried about \nhim.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\n Course not. I put a lot of work in with him, that&rsquo;s all. I&rsquo;d hate to \nsee all that go to waste. Who know what influences he&rsquo;s going to fall \nunder now? They might be nice. They might not know when to make\n him the hot chocolate with the stars and when to just sit and play \nMinecraft with him until he&rsquo;s ready to talk.\u201d<a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/new#sdfootnote7sym\"><sup>1</sup></a><br/></p><p>Aziraphale\n blinked again but more slowly this time. Apparently there was quite a \nlot he&rsquo;d missed while he was out in the garden. \u201cMaybe - \u201c he started, \nbut Crowley was already talking again.</p><p>\u201cSudden changes can be extremely distressing for children, all the books say so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBooks?\u201d</p><p>Crowley looked at him and Aziraphale just knew he was rolling his eyes behind his shades. \u201cYess, books. I can read, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you can, I just didn&rsquo;t know you had,\u201d he tried to explain. \u201cNo, hang on, that sounds worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have any idea what kind of qualifications you need to be a nanny these days? I thought if I didn&rsquo;t know any of\n the latest buzzwords it might look suspicious. So I glanced through \nsome child development books in preparation. Which, I might add, is more\n than you did to be a gardener.\u201d</p><p>He couldn&rsquo;t help the smile. \u201cI love you,\u201d he said, immediately following it up with \u201cMeep!\u201d</p><p>\u201cReal gardeners don&rsquo;t encourage slugs, and do you even know the first thing about compost&hellip;what did you just say?\u201d </p><p>Aziraphale\n currently had both of his hands clamped against his mouth. \u201cMmmph,\u201d he \nsaid, hoping that somehow that would be enough.</p><p>Crowley\n was staring at him, sitting rigidly upright on the edge of the sofa \nlike he was considering either running or just discorporating there and \nthen. \u201cI&hellip;you&hellip;no, you can&rsquo;t&hellip;are you sure?\u201d</p><p>One\n of them was going to have to be brave. Unfortunately it looked like it \nwas going to have to be him. \u201cQuite sure, I&rsquo;m afraid. I&rsquo;ve known for, \noh, almost seven decades now.\u201d</p><p>Crowley continued to stare.</p><p>He\n shifted nervously, wondering again about miracling himself somewhere \nfar away. \u201cMy dear, it would really help if you said \u2013 mmph!\u201d He was \ninterrupted by Crowley surging forwards and kissing him.</p><p>It wasn&rsquo;t a very good kiss,\n all things considered. There were far too many teeth clattering \ntogether, and Crowley never had been all that sure just how human \ntongues were supposed to work. The second one was much better. As was the third.</p><p>Later, soberer, they lay back on the sofa together, feathers lightly entangled.</p><p>\u201cWe could take a trip to go and see Warlock tomorrow,\u201d Aziraphale suggested.</p><p>\u201cIf you like,\u201d Crowley said, like it was a great favour he was willing to confer.</p><p>He\n was, as always, happy to play along. \u201cIt would make me feel better. We \ncould say goodbye properly. Maybe even give him a forwarding address.\u201d</p><p>Crowley\n squeezed his hand tightly.

It was an activity he was both naturally suited for and \nvery well practised in. On this particular occasion he was expressing \nhis fretfullness by making numerous cups of tea and allowing them to \ngrow cold, picking up and reading the first few pages of several \nabsolutely blameless books before setting them aside, and glancing \nfrequently at the telephone and the bell above the shop door, both of \nwhich adamantly refused to ring.<a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/new#sdfootnote1sym\"><sup>1</sup></a><br></p><p>It wasn\u2019t as though he had any reason to worry, he told himself firmly. Crowley hadn\u2019t said he\n was going to come over today, they certainly hadn\u2019t had any plans. It \nwas just that\u2026well, it was just that since the notpocalypse Crowley \nhad made a habit of popping in to see him of an afternoon. Most \nafternoons. All afternoons. And now it was well after teatime and \nheading towards dinner and not a word. Surely heaven or hell couldn\u2019t \nhave got a hold of him. They\u2019d both been sure they\u2019d be left alone for \nthe time being at least. And if either side had figured out their little body switcheroo surely they would have descended on both of them.</p><p>He took a deep breath and carefully laid the book he had been trying to focus on aside. Really it wasn\u2019t like he should expect Crowley to just show up. In the beginning they\u2019d gone centuries without seeing each other after all.<a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/new#sdfootnote2sym\"><sup>2</sup></a>\n But centuries had gradually turned into decades then years and in \nrecent times what with young Warlock, and then the apocalypse and being \non their own side and everything, well, they\u2019d practically been living \nin each other\u2019s pockets. </p><p>It\n would make sense that Crowley might want some time to himself. He only \nwished, rather selfishly, that the dear boy had just said something. \nHe\u2019d rather thought they were heading towards something new here. \nRedefining the nature of their relationship, as it were. </p><p>A horrible thought suddenly struck him. If that was what\n they were doing hadn\u2019t he been relying on Crowley to make all the \neffort? Here he was waiting for Crowley to come over or call\u2026maybe he \nhadn\u2019t been showing enough commitment of his own? Maybe Aziraphale \nhadn\u2019t been appreciating him enough, and now Crowley thought his \npresence was unwelcome and he was going to stop popping round and get \ninto one of his moods again and do something unfathomably silly, like \nsleep for another century,or move to America and cut off all his lovely \nhair again, or find whatever new intoxicants the humans were using and \noverindulge. And heaven\u2026no-one only knew whether he\u2019d remember that \nbeing discorporated wouldn\u2019t just mean a quick trip down below for some \nunpleasantness and paperwork in order to get a new body.<a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/new#sdfootnote3sym\"><sup>3</sup></a><br></p><p>At\n that thought Aziraphale snatched up his coat, ran out the door and \nhailed an idling cab whose previous fare had miraculously decided to get\n out and walk the rest of the way. <br></p><p>*<br></p><p><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/new#sdfootnote1anc\">1</a>Actually\n the shop bell had rung twice that day, but on both occasions it had \nproved to be a customer which was the last thing the bookshop needed.</p><p><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/new#sdfootnote2anc\">2</a>This\n wasn\u2019t quite true, in the Beginning they hadn\u2019t known each other at \nall, and in the time immediately after the Garden, which was more what \nAziraphale had in mind, their temptations and blessings had been very \nmuch focused on the one existing family and so they\u2019d seen each other \nnearly every single day, though they\u2019d rarely exchanged more than the \nodd embarrassed nod.</p><p><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/new#sdfootnote3anc\">3</a>You\n might think that this is rather a lot of panic and suppositions over \nsomeone who has only been \u2018missing\u2019 for a few hours. But Aziraphale had \nhad a very trying time of it lately and the effects of adrenaline take \nlonger to fade in those of angelic stock than in humans.</p><p>*</p><p>He\n had been to Crowley\u2019s flat before of course. Well. Once. The night \nafter armageddon\u2019t. But even if he hadn\u2019t he\u2019d have been able to find it\n by following his awareness of Crowley through London, though admittedly\n that particular method of navigation would have been difficult to \nexplain to the cabbie. The door was locked and he knocked a couple of \ntimes before walking in, rationalising to himself that he was just \nchecking that everything was as it should be. </p><p>\u201cCrowley?\u201d\n he called from the hall, shifting uncomfortably as a wave of heat and \nhumidity hit him. \u201cIt\u2019s me, dear. I thought I\u2019d see if you wanted to get\n dinner?\u201d </p><p>There was no answer. He moved deeper inside, telling himself that he wasn\u2019t really intruding,\n after all they\u2019d known each other for 6000 years and Crowley was always\n popping into the bookshop unannounced. Turnabout was fair play and all \nthat. It really was very warm in here. Perhaps Crowley was just taking a\n nap. He always did like the temperature far too high, old serpent that \nhe was. </p><p>Giving\n the spot on the floor where once had lain the foul remains of a demon \nand a thermos of holy water a wide berth and an unhappy grimace<a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/new#sdfootnote4sym\"><sup>1</sup></a>,\n he followed a sense of fear and anxiety through a closed door at the \nend of the hall and was confronted with a wall of green. Oh, yes, of \ncourse, Crowley\u2019s plants. Gardening was one of those human \npreoccupations that Crowley had always been partial to, like sleep or \nmusic or gender. Aziraphale didn\u2019t exactly understand it, but he had \nonce read that having separate interests was very important so that was \nalright. He didn\u2019t have to. </p><p>Well,\n this seemed to be where the anxiety was originating from anyway. He \nfrowned at the money tree trembling in his face. \u201cHonestly, what does he\n do to you?\u201d he asked, going on to murmur a litany of soothing words. In\n response the plant promptly shuddered and produced a shiny red apple, \nalmost bending in two beneath its weight. \u201cYes, well\u2026\u201d Aziraphale \nlooked aside in embarrassment. It wasn\u2019t the sort of thing he\u2019d ever \nbeen crass enough to bring up, but inanimate objects tended to take on a\n life of their own around Crowley. The Bentley had its own tastes and \nOpinions for a start, and there had been that viol a few centuries back \nwhich Crowley had been so fond of and which Aziraphale would swear had \nbit him one night after he\u2019d misguidedly plucked a string. It wasn\u2019t \nlike Crowley went around whispering 'Let there be life\u2019 all over the \nplace, it was just that he could get a little overfocused on his \nobsessions.<a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/new#sdfootnote5sym\"><sup>2</sup></a><br></p><p>\u201cAnyway,\u201d\n he said brightly, dusting off his hands and getting back to the \noriginal point. \u201cCrowley! Crowley, dear boy, are you in?\u201d He tried \nanother door and found himself in a study of sorts with\u2026was that a \nthrone? He pressed his fingers up against his lips, suppressing a \nridiculous. How absolutely ridiculous, he thought fondly. And how typical. </p><p>There\n was a slight noise behind him and he turned quickly to see a twelve \nfoot long black snake with a bright red hood inches away from his face.</p><p>With a yelp the angel leapt back about three feet. With a hiss, so did the demon.</p><p>\u201cReally, my dear,\u201d Aziraphale said, brushing off his lapels carefully. \u201cYou startled me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSsstartled you?\u201d Crowley exclaimed, surprisingly expressively for a snake. \u201cI\u2019m ssorry, whosse home are we in again? I wass assleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\n well.\u201d Now that he was actually here in front of a Crowley who was \nevidently unharmed and wasn\u2019t noticeably pining away he felt rather \nsilly. \u201cI thought we\u2019d been going out this afternoon and when you didn\u2019t\n show up I thought maybe I should meet you here.\u201d</p><p>Crowley reared back, his tongue flickering agitatedly. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have planss, did we? I would have remembered plansss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d\n Aziraphale said stiffly, somewhere between the point of wishing himself\n far away and actually miracling it. \u201cI suppose I just rather assumed.\u201d</p><p>They stared at each other for a long moment.</p><p>Eventually Aziraphale coughed. \u201cWell. I won\u2019t intrude any further,\u201d he said, turning to walk away.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t!\u201d\n Crowley transformed in an instant, hand reaching out to lightly grasp \nAziraphale\u2019s sleeve. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, angel. I didn\u2019t mean to chase you away.\n I was just surprised to see you is all. But not all surprises are bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell.\u201d Aziraphale felt his cheeks pinken. \u201cThat\u2019s alright then. Shall we have some wine?\u201d</p><p>*<br></p><p><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/new#sdfootnote4anc\">1</a>Aziraphale had been the one to carefully miracle it away that night. But he would always know it had been there.</p><p><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/new#sdfootnote5anc\">2</a>Aziraphale\n did have the grace to be aware he was being something of a hypocrite \nhere, but in his own defense his books had never expressed any emotions \nof their own.<a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/new#sdfootnote6sym\">3</a></p><p><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/new#sdfootnote6anc\">3</a>They did tend to take on the emotional aura of those around them, however. In most cases Aziraphale\u2019s collection reflected love.</p><p>*<br></p><p>A\n few moments later found them on a leather sofa that was impossibly \ncomfier than it looked, drinking a vintage that was rather superior to \nthe one it had been when Aziraphale had bought it.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know you were scared of snakes, angel,\u201d Crowley said, pouring them another glass.</p><p>He sat up indignantly. \u201cI am not! Why would anyone be scared of snakes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDunno. But lots of humans are. Think maybe it\u2019s because they think all snakes are poisonous?\u201d</p><p>Aziraphale\n quickly glanced towards him and equally quickly looked aside. \u201cWell, my\n dear, that would only be a problem were I planning on eating you.\u201d</p><p>He hid his smile behind his wine glass as Crowley choked.</p><p>\u201cWhat have you been doing today anyway,\u201d he asked before the demon had a chance to fully recover.</p><p>The light vanished from Crowley\u2019s face in an instant. \u201cOh, this and that. Thinking, mostly.\u201d</p><p>Brooding, Aziraphale mentally translated. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing\u2026wrong, is there?\u201d he asked hesitantly. \u201cYou haven\u2019t heard from\u2026\u201d He gestured vaguely downwards.</p><p>\u201cNo. No, nothing like that, \u2019s just\u2026\u201d He tilted his head back to look at the ceiling. \u201cDo you think Warlock\u2019s doing okay?\u201d</p><p>Aziraphale blinked. He hadn\u2019t been expecting that. \u201cOh, I\u2019m sure he is. Why wouldn\u2019t he be, after all?\u201d</p><p>Crowley\n drained his glass. \u201cWell, I mean, it\u2019s just that I\u2019d \u2013 we\u2019d \u2013 always \nbeen there for him since before he can remember, and now we\u2019re not. And \nyou know what his parents are like.\u201d</p><p>He\n nodded, even though in his experience Mr and Mrs Dowling had been \nperfectly unobjectionable. His lips twitched. \u201cYou\u2019re worried about \nhim.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\n Course not. I put a lot of work in with him, that\u2019s all. I\u2019d hate to \nsee all that go to waste. Who know what influences he\u2019s going to fall \nunder now? They might be nice. They might not know when to make\n him the hot chocolate with the stars and when to just sit and play \nMinecraft with him until he\u2019s ready to talk.\u201d<a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/new#sdfootnote7sym\"><sup>1</sup></a><br></p><p>Aziraphale\n blinked again but more slowly this time. Apparently there was quite a \nlot he\u2019d missed while he was out in the garden. \u201cMaybe - \u201c he started, \nbut Crowley was already talking again.</p><p>\u201cSudden changes can be extremely distressing for children, all the books say so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBooks?\u201d</p><p>Crowley looked at him and Aziraphale just knew he was rolling his eyes behind his shades. \u201cYess, books. I can read, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you can, I just didn\u2019t know you had,\u201d he tried to explain. \u201cNo, hang on, that sounds worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have any idea what kind of qualifications you need to be a nanny these days? I thought if I didn\u2019t know any of\n the latest buzzwords it might look suspicious. So I glanced through \nsome child development books in preparation. Which, I might add, is more\n than you did to be a gardener.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t help the smile. \u201cI love you,\u201d he said, immediately following it up with \u201cMeep!\u201d</p><p>\u201cReal gardeners don\u2019t encourage slugs, and do you even know the first thing about compost\u2026what did you just say?\u201d </p><p>Aziraphale\n currently had both of his hands clamped against his mouth. \u201cMmmph,\u201d he \nsaid, hoping that somehow that would be enough.</p><p>Crowley\n was staring at him, sitting rigidly upright on the edge of the sofa \nlike he was considering either running or just discorporating there and \nthen. \u201cI\u2026you\u2026no, you can\u2019t\u2026are you sure?\u201d</p><p>One\n of them was going to have to be brave. Unfortunately it looked like it \nwas going to have to be him. \u201cQuite sure, I\u2019m afraid. I\u2019ve known for, \noh, almost seven decades now.\u201d</p><p>Crowley continued to stare.</p><p>He\n shifted nervously, wondering again about miracling himself somewhere \nfar away. \u201cMy dear, it would really help if you said \u2013 mmph!\u201d He was \ninterrupted by Crowley surging forwards and kissing him.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t a very good kiss,\n all things considered. There were far too many teeth clattering \ntogether, and Crowley never had been all that sure just how human \ntongues were supposed to work. The second one was much better. As was the third.</p><p>Later, soberer, they lay back on the sofa together, feathers lightly entangled.</p><p>\u201cWe could take a trip to go and see Warlock tomorrow,\u201d Aziraphale suggested.</p><p>\u201cIf you like,\u201d Crowley said, like it was a great favour he was willing to confer.</p><p>He\n was, as always, happy to play along. \u201cIt would make me feel better. We \ncould say goodbye properly. Maybe even give him a forwarding address.\u201d</p><p>Crowley\n squeezed his hand tightly. His sunglasses were gone now and his eyes \nwere luminous in the dim light. \u201cAziraphale\u2026you know I do too, right? \nLove you, I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes,\u201d he said, and he did. And that was everything that seemed to matter.</p><p><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/new#sdfootnote7anc\">1</a>For\n those wondering what an ancient demon and an eleven year old \nnot-antichrist might build in Minecraft, the answers vary from a volcano\n lair complete with McDonalds, a theme park filled with screaming \nvillagers, and a remarkably accurate recreation of the hanging gardens \nof Babylon.</p>",

I wass assleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\n well.\u201d Now that he was actually here in front of a Crowley who was \nevidently unharmed and wasn\u2019t noticeably pining away he felt rather \nsilly. \u201cI thought we\u2019d been going out this afternoon and when you didn\u2019t\n show up I thought maybe I should meet you here.\u201d</p><p>Crowley reared back, his tongue flickering agitatedly. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have planss, did we?

I won\u2019t intrude any further,\u201d he said, turning to walk away.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t!\u201d\n Crowley transformed in an instant, hand reaching out to lightly grasp \nAziraphale\u2019s sleeve. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, angel.

Why would anyone be scared of snakes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDunno. But lots of humans are. Think maybe it\u2019s because they think all snakes are poisonous?\u201d</p><p>Aziraphale\n quickly glanced towards him and equally quickly looked aside. \u201cWell, my\n dear, that would only be a problem were I planning on eating you.\u201d</p><p>He hid his smile behind his wine glass as Crowley choked.</p><p>\u201cWhat have you been doing today anyway,\u201d he asked before the demon had a chance to fully recover.</p><p>The light vanished from Crowley\u2019s face in an instant. \u201cOh, this and that. Thinking, mostly.\u201d</p><p>Brooding, Aziraphale mentally translated. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing\u2026wrong, is there?\u201d he asked hesitantly. \u201cYou haven\u2019t heard from\u2026\u201d He gestured vaguely downwards.</p><p>\u201cNo. No, nothing like that, \u2019s just\u2026\u201d He tilted his head back to look at the ceiling. \u201cDo you think Warlock\u2019s doing okay?\u201d</p><p>Aziraphale blinked. He hadn\u2019t been expecting that. \u201cOh, I\u2019m sure he is. Why wouldn\u2019t he be, after all?\u201d</p><p>Crowley\n drained his glass. \u201cWell, I mean, it\u2019s just that I\u2019d \u2013 we\u2019d \u2013 always \nbeen there for him since before he can remember, and now we\u2019re not. And \nyou know what his parents are like.\u201d</p><p>He\n nodded, even though in his experience Mr and Mrs Dowling had been \nperfectly unobjectionable. His lips twitched. \u201cYou\u2019re worried about \nhim.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\n Course not. I put a lot of work in with him, that\u2019s all. I\u2019d hate to \nsee all that go to waste. Who know what influences he\u2019s going to fall \nunder now? They might be nice. They might not know when to make\n him the hot chocolate with the stars and when to just sit and play \nMinecraft with him until he\u2019s ready to talk.\u201d<a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/new#sdfootnote7sym\"><sup>1</sup></a><br></p><p>Aziraphale\n blinked again but more slowly this time. Apparently there was quite a \nlot he\u2019d missed while he was out in the garden. \u201cMaybe - \u201c he started, \nbut Crowley was already talking again.</p><p>\u201cSudden changes can be extremely distressing for children, all the books say so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBooks?\u201d</p><p>Crowley looked at him and Aziraphale just knew he was rolling his eyes behind his shades. \u201cYess, books. I can read, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you can, I just didn\u2019t know you had,\u201d he tried to explain. \u201cNo, hang on, that sounds worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have any idea what kind of qualifications you need to be a nanny these days? I thought if I didn\u2019t know any of\n the latest buzzwords it might look suspicious. So I glanced through \nsome child development books in preparation. Which, I might add, is more\n than you did to be a gardener.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t help the smile. \u201cI love you,\u201d he said, immediately following it up with \u201cMeep!\u201d</p><p>\u201cReal gardeners don\u2019t encourage slugs, and do you even know the first thing about compost\u2026what did you just say?\u201d </p><p>Aziraphale\n currently had both of his hands clamped against his mouth. \u201cMmmph,\u201d he \nsaid, hoping that somehow that would be enough.</p><p>Crowley\n was staring at him, sitting rigidly upright on the edge of the sofa \nlike he was considering either running or just discorporating there and \nthen. \u201cI\u2026you\u2026no, you can\u2019t\u2026are you sure?\u201d</p><p>One\n of them was going to have to be brave. Unfortunately it looked like it \nwas going to have to be him. \u201cQuite sure, I\u2019m afraid. I\u2019ve known for, \noh, almost seven decades now.\u201d</p><p>Crowley continued to stare.</p><p>He\n shifted nervously, wondering again about miracling himself somewhere \nfar away. \u201cMy dear, it would really help if you said \u2013 mmph!\u201d He was \ninterrupted by Crowley surging forwards and kissing him.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t a very good kiss,\n all things considered. There were far too many teeth clattering \ntogether, and Crowley never had been all that sure just how human \ntongues were supposed to work. The second one was much better. As was the third.</p><p>Later, soberer, they lay back on the sofa together, feathers lightly entangled.</p><p>\u201cWe could take a trip to go and see Warlock tomorrow,\u201d Aziraphale suggested.</p><p>\u201cIf you like,\u201d Crowley said, like it was a great favour he was willing to confer.</p><p>He\n was, as always, happy to play along. \u201cIt would make me feel better. We \ncould say goodbye properly. Maybe even give him a forwarding address.\u201d</p><p>Crowley\n squeezed his hand tightly. His sunglasses were gone now and his eyes \nwere luminous in the dim light. \u201cAziraphale\u2026you know I do too, right? \nLove you, I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes,\u201d he said, and he did.

Thinking, mostly.&rdquo;</p><p>Brooding, Aziraphale mentally translated. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing&hellip;wrong, is there?&rdquo; he asked hesitantly. &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t heard from&hellip;&rdquo; He gestured vaguely downwards.</p><p>&ldquo;No. No, nothing like that, &rsquo;s just&hellip;&rdquo; He tilted his head back to look at the ceiling. &ldquo;Do you think Warlock&rsquo;s doing okay?&rdquo;</p><p>Aziraphale blinked. He hadn&rsquo;t been expecting that. &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m sure he is. Why wouldn&rsquo;t he be, after all?&rdquo;</p><p>Crowley\n drained his glass. &ldquo;Well, I mean, it&rsquo;s just that I&rsquo;d &ndash; we&rsquo;d &ndash; always \nbeen there for him since before he can remember, and now we&rsquo;re not. And \nyou know what his parents are like.&rdquo;</p><p>He\n nodded, even though in his experience Mr and Mrs Dowling had been \nperfectly unobjectionable. His lips twitched. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re worried about \nhim.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No!\n Course not. I put a lot of work in with him, that&rsquo;s all. I&rsquo;d hate to \nsee all that go to waste. Who know what influences he&rsquo;s going to fall \nunder now? They might be nice. They might not know when to make\n him the hot chocolate with the stars and when to just sit and play \nMinecraft with him until he&rsquo;s ready to talk.&rdquo;<a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/new#sdfootnote7sym\"><sup>1</sup></a><br /></p><p>Aziraphale\n blinked again but more slowly this time. Apparently there was quite a \nlot he&rsquo;d missed while he was out in the garden. &ldquo;Maybe - &ldquo; he started, \nbut Crowley was already talking again.</p><p>&ldquo;Sudden changes can be extremely distressing for children, all the books say so.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Books?&rdquo;</p><p>Crowley looked at him and Aziraphale just knew he was rolling his eyes behind his shades. &ldquo;Yess, books. I can read, you know.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know you can, I just didn&rsquo;t know you had,&rdquo; he tried to explain. &ldquo;No, hang on, that sounds worse.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Do you have any idea what kind of qualifications you need to be a nanny these days? I thought if I didn&rsquo;t know any of\n the latest buzzwords it might look suspicious. So I glanced through \nsome child development books in preparation. Which, I might add, is more\n than you did to be a gardener.&rdquo;</p><p>He couldn&rsquo;t help the smile. &ldquo;I love you,&rdquo; he said, immediately following it up with &ldquo;Meep!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Real gardeners don&rsquo;t encourage slugs, and do you even know the first thing about compost&hellip;what did you just say?&rdquo; </p><p>Aziraphale\n currently had both of his hands clamped against his mouth. &ldquo;Mmmph,&rdquo; he \nsaid, hoping that somehow that would be enough.</p><p>Crowley\n was staring at him, sitting rigidly upright on the edge of the sofa \nlike he was considering either running or just discorporating there and \nthen. &ldquo;I&hellip;you&hellip;no, you can&rsquo;t&hellip;are you sure?&rdquo;</p><p>One\n of them was going to have to be brave. Unfortunately it looked like it \nwas going to have to be him. &ldquo;Quite sure, I&rsquo;m afraid. I&rsquo;ve known for, \noh, almost seven decades now.&rdquo;</p><p>Crowley continued to stare.</p><p>He\n shifted nervously, wondering again about miracling himself somewhere \nfar away. &ldquo;My dear, it would really help if you said &ndash; mmph!&rdquo; He was \ninterrupted by Crowley surging forwards and kissing him.</p><p>It wasn&rsquo;t a very good kiss,\n all things considered. There were far too many teeth clattering \ntogether, and Crowley never had been all that sure just how human \ntongues were supposed to work. The second one was much better. As was the third.</p><p>Later, soberer, they lay back on the sofa together, feathers lightly entangled.</p><p>&ldquo;We could take a trip to go and see Warlock tomorrow,&rdquo; Aziraphale suggested.</p><p>&ldquo;If you like,&rdquo; Crowley said, like it was a great favour he was willing to confer.</p><p>He\n was, as always, happy to play along. &ldquo;It would make me feel better. We \ncould say goodbye properly. Maybe even give him a forwarding address.&rdquo;</p><p>Crowley\n squeezed his hand tightly. His sunglasses were gone now and his eyes \nwere luminous in the dim light. &ldquo;Aziraphale&hellip;you know I do too, right? \nLove you, I mean.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; he said, and he did. And that was everything that seemed to matter.</p><p><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/new#sdfootnote7anc\">1</a>For\n those wondering what an ancient demon and an eleven year old \nnot-antichrist might build in Minecraft, the answers vary from a volcano\n lair complete with McDonalds, a theme park filled with screaming \nvillagers, and a remarkably accurate recreation of the hanging gardens \nof Babylon.</p>",
