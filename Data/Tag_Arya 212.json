It was typical Brandon, the attitude he\u2019d had all his life with his younger siblings, that if you came to him with the same problem more than once, and each time complained of the same thing, worried about the same thing without listening to his advice, without trying to change anything then he would stop listening. It was his way, and father\u2019s way, of making them \u201cproactive about their own happiness,\u201d of not letting them wallow in misery. It had never worked for anyone other than Brandon. When the Daynes had found out Ashara had an abortion, when they demanded he come to Starfall to marry her and set things right, he had done so without complaint. When the Tullys were inflamed by that, he signed over his rights to Winterfell to Ned with similar irreverence. How much of it was performance and how much of it was real, Benjen didn\u2019t know and wouldn\u2019t dare ask Brandon. He couldn\u2019t imagine it was easy to give up his birthright, but if it wasn\u2019t Brandon didn\u2019t show it. </p><p>Brandon had no patience for indecisiveness, for compromise, for diplomatic arrangements of something as trivial as where to host their new year party. He would do whatever Ned thought was best that year, always the first to lose his temper and get off the phone.</p><p>It was easier when Jon got older and became more independent; he could choose where he wanted to go and travel without the usual royal entourage. This year he had already made plans with a young woman he was trying to hide from his family and wouldn\u2019t be joining them; Lyanna was staying behind in the capital; and Brandon had agreed to make the journey north from Starfall.</p><p>Ned had sent the household staff home for the holiday and was helping Catelyn make dinner. Benjen had been sent out to buy some last minute ingredients and, having been buzzed through the gates of Winterfell and juggling the grocery bags, awkwardly rang the doorbell with his elbow. </p><p>It was Brandon who opened the door, holding a champagne flute in his hand. It always threw Benjen off to see his brother so tan, even after all these years.<i> I guess that\u2019s what 20 years of living in Dorne would do to anyone, even a Stark.</i></p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take care of the bags,\u201d Brandon said, beginning to grab them from Benjen\u2019s arms.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>There was the sound of some arguing coming from down the hall.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Benjen asked.</p><p>Brandon pointed in the direction of the voices and shrugged, as though to say, go look for yourself. After all these years, it was still uncomfortable for Catelyn to have him around. Brandon tried to ease the tension by spending time with his nieces and nephews instead, and never bringing Ashara to Winterfell but whenever he accidentally overstepped, the mood would shift and the night would end quickly. It explained why he wanted to hide away in the kitchen now.</p><p>Benjen walked down the hall, through the foyer and into one of the living rooms. Arya was sitting on the couch, her face red, her arms crossed over her chest. Sansa sat on the couch across from her, glaring at her, their parents standing between them, frowning deeply. Catelyn had red blotches the skin of her arms and her neck, something Benjen knew after all these years only happened when she was furious.</p><p>Rickon and Bran were nowhere in sight but Robb was sitting on the piano bench facing them. He was the only one who didn\u2019t seem angry, just bemused. That comforted Benjen. </p><p>\u201cIs everything alright?\u201d Benjen asked.</p><p>\u201cArya was caught trying to sneak out,\u201d Robb answered quickly, trying to hide a smirk.</p><p>Benjen would have smiled at that, if the room didn\u2019t feel so tense. His niece certainly kept things interesting. She sometimes reminded him of Lyanna, of her attempts to cajole him into covering for her, for small things at first and then finally for a big thing, the thing he regretted although she insisted she didn\u2019t. Arya though, didn\u2019t have a co-conspirator; Sansa was much too different to understand her, let alone lie for her, and Bran was far too attached to Catelyn to lie to her, even for his sister. She ended up getting caught far more often than Lyanna ever had. But perhaps that was a good thing.</p><p>Robb continued, \u201cShe had one foot out her bedroom window when Sansa saw her.\u201d</p><p>That explained why Sansa was looking self-satisfied.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re here together as a family. Your Uncle Brandon came all the way from Dorne and Uncle Benjen is on leave from the Wall. It\u2019s very rude of you to not want to spend time with your family, Arya,\u201d Ned said softly, looking closely at his daughter.</p><p>Arya seemed almost ashamed by that but was too stubborn to admit it, and only averted her eyes. Her phone in her back pocket was ringing faintly and she was fidgeting anxiously but not moving for it.</p><p>\u201cWhere exactly did you think you were going?\u201d Catelyn asked, clearly exasperated, \u201cIt\u2019s new year\u2019s, it\u2019s not safe for you to be out there alone\u201d</p><p>Arya flushed at that, \u201cI can take care of myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re 16!\u201d Robb laughed.</p><p>Arya glared at him, moved as though to start for him and shut him up but thought better of it; it only made her big brother laugh more.</p><p>\u201cWhere were you planning on going?\u201d Ned asked, taking a seat beside her and speaking to her gently, trying to defuse the situation.</p><p>Arya didn\u2019t answer, seemed only to sink deeper into her seat.</p><p>\u201cDoes it have something to do with why your phone keeps ringing?\u201d Catelyn asked.</p><p>That did the trick. Arya\u2019s eyes flashed up instantly, and it was clear Catelyn had gotten to the heart of it. Benjen wanted to help her in that moment, remembering all the times Lyanna had been in the hot seat but it was too late \u2013 Arya was cornered.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just\u2026 It\u2019s just\u2026. Well, one of my friends is near Winterfell and I promised\u2026 I promised him I would go see him.\u201d</p><p>Everyone in the room understand the implications of <i>friend</i> and <i>him</i>, loud and clear. Even Robb didn\u2019t seem to have a response to that.</p><p>Ned had never spoken about his daughters having any boyfriends; in fact, Benjen hadn\u2019t thought even Robb had really started dating yet.</p><p>It was quiet for a moment, but Catelyn seemed to relax.

It was typical Brandon, the attitude he\u2019d had all his life with his younger siblings, that if you came to him with the same problem more than once, and each time complained of the same thing, worried about the same thing without listening to his advice, without trying to change anything then he would stop listening. It was his way, and father\u2019s way, of making them \u201cproactive about their own happiness,\u201d of not letting them wallow in misery. It had never worked for anyone other than Brandon. When the Daynes had found out Ashara had an abortion, when they demanded he come to Starfall to marry her and set things right, he had done so without complaint. When the Tullys were inflamed by that, he signed over his rights to Winterfell to Ned with similar irreverence. How much of it was performance and how much of it was real, Benjen didn\u2019t know and wouldn\u2019t dare ask Brandon. He couldn\u2019t imagine it was easy to give up his birthright, but if it wasn\u2019t Brandon didn\u2019t show it. </p><p>Brandon had no patience for indecisiveness, for compromise, for diplomatic arrangements of something as trivial as where to host their new year party. He would do whatever Ned thought was best that year, always the first to lose his temper and get off the phone.</p><p>It was easier when Jon got older and became more independent; he could choose where he wanted to go and travel without the usual royal entourage. This year he had already made plans with a young woman he was trying to hide from his family and wouldn\u2019t be joining them; Lyanna was staying behind in the capital; and Brandon had agreed to make the journey north from Starfall.</p><p>Ned had sent the household staff home for the holiday and was helping Catelyn make dinner. Benjen had been sent out to buy some last minute ingredients and, having been buzzed through the gates of Winterfell and juggling the grocery bags, awkwardly rang the doorbell with his elbow. </p><p>It was Brandon who opened the door, holding a champagne flute in his hand. It always threw Benjen off to see his brother so tan, even after all these years.<i> I guess that\u2019s what 20 years of living in Dorne would do to anyone, even a Stark.</i></p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take care of the bags,\u201d Brandon said, beginning to grab them from Benjen\u2019s arms.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>There was the sound of some arguing coming from down the hall.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Benjen asked.</p><p>Brandon pointed in the direction of the voices and shrugged, as though to say, go look for yourself. After all these years, it was still uncomfortable for Catelyn to have him around. Brandon tried to ease the tension by spending time with his nieces and nephews instead, and never bringing Ashara to Winterfell but whenever he accidentally overstepped, the mood would shift and the night would end quickly. It explained why he wanted to hide away in the kitchen now.</p><p>Benjen walked down the hall, through the foyer and into one of the living rooms. Arya was sitting on the couch, her face red, her arms crossed over her chest. Sansa sat on the couch across from her, glaring at her, their parents standing between them, frowning deeply. Catelyn had red blotches the skin of her arms and her neck, something Benjen knew after all these years only happened when she was furious.</p><p>Rickon and Bran were nowhere in sight but Robb was sitting on the piano bench facing them. He was the only one who didn\u2019t seem angry, just bemused. That comforted Benjen. </p><p>\u201cIs everything alright?\u201d Benjen asked.</p><p>\u201cArya was caught trying to sneak out,\u201d Robb answered quickly, trying to hide a smirk.</p><p>Benjen would have smiled at that, if the room didn\u2019t feel so tense. His niece certainly kept things interesting. She sometimes reminded him of Lyanna, of her attempts to cajole him into covering for her, for small things at first and then finally for a big thing, the thing he regretted although she insisted she didn\u2019t. Arya though, didn\u2019t have a co-conspirator; Sansa was much too different to understand her, let alone lie for her, and Bran was far too attached to Catelyn to lie to her, even for his sister. She ended up getting caught far more often than Lyanna ever had. But perhaps that was a good thing.</p><p>Robb continued, \u201cShe had one foot out her bedroom window when Sansa saw her.\u201d</p><p>That explained why Sansa was looking self-satisfied.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re here together as a family. Your Uncle Brandon came all the way from Dorne and Uncle Benjen is on leave from the Wall. It\u2019s very rude of you to not want to spend time with your family, Arya,\u201d Ned said softly, looking closely at his daughter.</p><p>Arya seemed almost ashamed by that but was too stubborn to admit it, and only averted her eyes. Her phone in her back pocket was ringing faintly and she was fidgeting anxiously but not moving for it.</p><p>\u201cWhere exactly did you think you were going?\u201d Catelyn asked, clearly exasperated, \u201cIt\u2019s new year\u2019s, it\u2019s not safe for you to be out there alone\u201d</p><p>Arya flushed at that, \u201cI can take care of myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re 16!\u201d Robb laughed.</p><p>Arya glared at him, moved as though to start for him and shut him up but thought better of it; it only made her big brother laugh more.</p><p>\u201cWhere were you planning on going?\u201d Ned asked, taking a seat beside her and speaking to her gently, trying to defuse the situation.</p><p>Arya didn\u2019t answer, seemed only to sink deeper into her seat.</p><p>\u201cDoes it have something to do with why your phone keeps ringing?\u201d Catelyn asked.</p><p>That did the trick. Arya\u2019s eyes flashed up instantly, and it was clear Catelyn had gotten to the heart of it. Benjen wanted to help her in that moment, remembering all the times Lyanna had been in the hot seat but it was too late \u2013 Arya was cornered.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just\u2026 It\u2019s just\u2026. Well, one of my friends is near Winterfell and I promised\u2026 I promised him I would go see him.\u201d</p><p>Everyone in the room understand the implications of <i>friend</i> and <i>him</i>, loud and clear. Even Robb didn\u2019t seem to have a response to that.</p><p>Ned had never spoken about his daughters having any boyfriends; in fact, Benjen hadn\u2019t thought even Robb had really started dating yet.</p><p>It was quiet for a moment, but Catelyn seemed to relax. Her mind had likely been running with much worse possibilities.</p><p>\u201cWell, why don\u2019t you ask your friend to join us?\u201d She asked.</p><p>Arya shook her head instantly, \u201cNo, he wouldn\u2019t like that\u2026 I mean, it\u2019s early\u2026 We haven\u2019t known each other for very long, we just became friends.

But perhaps that was a good thing.</p><p>Robb continued, &ldquo;She had one foot out her bedroom window when Sansa saw her.&rdquo;</p><p>That explained why Sansa was looking self-satisfied.</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re here together as a family. Your Uncle Brandon came all the way from Dorne and Uncle Benjen is on leave from the Wall. It&rsquo;s very rude of you to not want to spend time with your family, Arya,&rdquo; Ned said softly, looking closely at his daughter.</p><p>Arya seemed almost ashamed by that but was too stubborn to admit it, and only averted her eyes. Her phone in her back pocket was ringing faintly and she was fidgeting anxiously but not moving for it.</p><p>&ldquo;Where exactly did you think you were going?&rdquo; Catelyn asked, clearly exasperated, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s new year&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s not safe for you to be out there alone&rdquo;</p><p>Arya flushed at that, &ldquo;I can take care of myself.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re 16!&rdquo; Robb laughed.</p><p>Arya glared at him, moved as though to start for him and shut him up but thought better of it; it only made her big brother laugh more.</p><p>&ldquo;Where were you planning on going?&rdquo; Ned asked, taking a seat beside her and speaking to her gently, trying to defuse the situation.</p><p>Arya didn&rsquo;t answer, seemed only to sink deeper into her seat.</p><p>&ldquo;Does it have something to do with why your phone keeps ringing?&rdquo; Catelyn asked.</p><p>That did the trick. Arya&rsquo;s eyes flashed up instantly, and it was clear Catelyn had gotten to the heart of it. Benjen wanted to help her in that moment, remembering all the times Lyanna had been in the hot seat but it was too late &ndash; Arya was cornered.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just&hellip; It&rsquo;s just&hellip;. Well, one of my friends is near Winterfell and I promised&hellip; I promised him I would go see him.&rdquo;</p><p>Everyone in the room understand the implications of <i>friend</i> and <i>him</i>, loud and clear. Even Robb didn&rsquo;t seem to have a response to that.</p><p>Ned had never spoken about his daughters having any boyfriends; in fact, Benjen hadn&rsquo;t thought even Robb had really started dating yet.</p><p>It was quiet for a moment, but Catelyn seemed to relax. Her mind had likely been running with much worse possibilities.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, why don&rsquo;t you ask your friend to join us?&rdquo; She asked.</p><p>Arya shook her head instantly, &ldquo;No, he wouldn&rsquo;t like that&hellip; I mean, it&rsquo;s early&hellip; We haven&rsquo;t known each other for very long, we just became friends. I was only going to show him around the festival in Winter Town.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Ned responded slowly, weighing his words carefully, &ldquo;How about we make a deal? If you start being honest us, no more of this sneaking around, Robb can drive you to meet this young man for a couple of hours. But when you come back, we have to have a serious talk&rdquo;</p><p>Robb protested immediately, &ldquo;Why me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s alright,&rdquo; Benjen cut in, before another argument rose up, &ldquo;I can drive you, Arya.&rdquo;</p><p>Arya smiled so brilliantly that any doubt about the significance of this mystery boy to her.</p><p>Later, when they were driving towards winter town, Arya sitting in the passenger seat, her eyes glued to her phone, thumbs moving rapidly across the screen, Benjen turned to her as they stopped at a traffic light.</p><p>&ldquo;What is this guy&rsquo;s name, anyway?&rdquo;</p><p>His niece seemed to smile at that, just barely.</p><p>&ldquo;Gendry.&rdquo;</p>",
