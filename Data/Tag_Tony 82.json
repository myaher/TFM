There\u2019s something I haven\u2019t told you which, like, isn\u2019t a huge deal, but actually no, it is kinda important and I know I probably should have told you sooner, it\u2019s not like I think you\u2019re gonna freak out or anything, I just hadn\u2019t gotten around to it yet and -\u201d Peter was rambling. He was also still pulling Tony down the hallway.</p><p>Tony needed to put a stop to this. He was pretty sure that even if he stopped walking Peter wouldn\u2019t notice, and with his strength, he\u2019d quite literally end up pulling Tony down the hall, so that plan was out. He wasn\u2019t sure where Peter was taking them, or if the kid even had a place in mind at all and wasn\u2019t just dragging him around in circles out of panic. But there was no one around, and Peter\u2019s voice was getting a little too fast and his breathing too rapid for Tony to let this go on any longer. He quickened his pace, jogging around to cut the boy off and placed his hands on Peter\u2019s shoulders.</p><p>\u201cPeter.\u201d The boy\u2019s eyes snapped up to meet his. \u00a0\u201cDeep breath, kid.

Tony took one of the kid\u2019s hands and placed it on his chest so the boy could time his breathing to his mentor\u2019s. Peter let out a huff and his whole body sagged, his eyes falling to the floor, \u201cI\u2019m bi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Peter.\u201d Tony\u2019s entire demeanor softened. He brought the hand that was still on Peter\u2019s shoulder up to the boy\u2019s cheek, he needed Peter to look at him so he could see his sincerity. \u201cThank you for telling me, bud. I am <i>so happy</i> that you feel comfortable enough with me to do that.\u201d Peter seemed to relax and Tony\u2019s smile grew as he let out a small laugh, \u201cAnd listen, I know that \u2018I know\u2019 isn\u2019t a great response to coming out, but Pete, I didn\u2019t realize it was a secret.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?!\u201d</p><p>Tony knew this was a big moment for the kid so he tried his best not to laugh at the horror on the boy\u2019s face as he extracted himself from his mentor\u2019s hold, but he wouldn\u2019t be him if he didn\u2019t at least tease Peter little bit. \u201cWell, I assume you\u2019re telling me this because you have a crush on Mr. Darcy back there. You haven\u2019t exactly been subtle about it, bud.\u201d</p><p>An alarmed, choked off noise sprung from the back of Peter\u2019s throat. \u201cDude!\u201d</p><p>Tony rolled his eyes, \u201cSeriously, Pete, I\u2019m really happy you told me, but I don\u2019t get why we had to run out on Asgard\u2019s most eligible bachelor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, Mr. Stark, maybe you don\u2019t understand because you\u2019re\u2026\u201d Peter waved his hands up and down at Tony as if that was supposed to explain anything. \u201cWell, you\u2019re Tony Stark, but most people aren\u2019t prepared to meet their celebrity crush on a random Tuesday in the middle of June.\u201d</p><p>Okay, so maybe Tony was a little more used to hanging around the rich and famous than your average guy, but he had kind of figured between him and Pepper and the couple other Avengers that Peter had met that the kid was getting pretty used to it too. \u201cWhat are you saying here, Underoos?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m saying\u2026\u201d Peter sighed. \u201cI\u2019m saying I was 11 when the battle of New York happened and that Thor was the first guy I ever had a crush on.\u201d He was full on mumbling, cheeks red, staring holes into the floor, embarrassed. Tony would feel bad if it wasn\u2019t so goddamn adorable.</p><p>\u201cThank you&hellip;so much for telling me that, I\u2019m never letting you live that down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot the point, Mr. Stark!\u201d Tony barked out a laugh at the indignant look on Peter\u2019s face and threw an arm around his shoulders.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, bud, I promise to not purposefully embarrass you in front of Thor.\u201d He started steering Peter back towards the common room.</p><p>Peter let himself be guided by the older man, but his reluctance was clear on his face and in his crossed arms and as he mumbled, \u201cI don\u2019t believe you.\u201d</p><p>Tony nodded his head solemnly, \u201cThat\u2019s probably smart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Stark!\u201d Peter stopped in his tracks, a look of pure betrayal covering his face.</p><p>\u201cOkay, fine!\u201d Tony held his arms up in a show of defeat. \u201cLet\u2019s just go back in there. I\u2019ll try and keep the conversation off you enough that you can just sit and ogle Thor\u2019s muscles.\u201d He patted the boy\u2019s shoulder and started walking back to the common room.</p><p>\u201cI crave death.\u201d The kid sounded miserable but Tony could hear him running to catch up with him, so it couldn\u2019t be too bad.</p><p>\u201cI know, kiddo, but this is so much more fun.\u201d</p><hr><p>The pair re-entered the living room to find Rhodey had joined Thor and was showing him his leg braces.</p><p>\u201cSorry about that. Kid just needed my help with some science stuff.\u201d</p><p>Rhodey looked at Tony questioningly. He just winked at his friend and shot him a conspiratory smile as he went to stand beside him, discretely leaning over to whisper, \u201cYou\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>Sure enough, Peter went straight up to the god, seemingly determined to make a better impression. \u201cHi, Mr. Thor. It\u2019s an honor to meet you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure it is.\u201d Only Thor could say that and still have people like him. If Tony says stuff like that everyone calls him an ass. \u201cRhodey was telling me that you helped with his new robot legs, that\u2019s very impressive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh I, um, I, well,\u201d There was the Peter Tony knew and loved. \u201cI helped Mr. Stark but I\u2019m more a scientist than an engineer.\u201d Peter was blushing so hard Tony was surprised there was any blood left in the rest of his body.</p><p>\u201cA scientist, you say?\u201d Thor looked impressed. \u201cYou\u2019ll probably get along well with Banner then. He should be here soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBanner?\u201d Peter\u2019s voice jumped back up about three octaves. \u201cAs in Dr. Bruce Banner?\u201d</p><p>Tony could see Rhodey\u2019s smirk out of the corner of his eye. He knew what was coming before the words left his friends mouth, \u201cHey, Blondie, do you know what a fanboy is?\u201d</p><p>The look Peter shot them would have been terrifying if it wasn\u2019t coming from the kindest kid in the world. \u201cI will kill you in your sleep.\u201d</p><p>It was good to know he had friends who would tease his kid for him when he couldn\u2019t.</p><hr><figure data-orig-width=\"1080\" data-orig-height=\"1080\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/5319a654fe641d1b35510ce35226b9e3/tumblr_inline_pplz09A4fR1rrr9y4_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1080\" data-orig-height=\"1080\"/></figure>",

There\u2019s something I haven\u2019t told you which, like, isn\u2019t a huge deal, but actually no, it is kinda important and I know I probably should have told you sooner, it\u2019s not like I think you\u2019re gonna freak out or anything, I just hadn\u2019t gotten around to it yet and -\u201d Peter was rambling.

He was pretty sure that even if he stopped walking Peter wouldn\u2019t notice, and with his strength, he\u2019d quite literally end up pulling Tony down the hall, so that plan was out. He wasn\u2019t sure where Peter was taking them, or if the kid even had a place in mind at all and wasn\u2019t just dragging him around in circles out of panic. But there was no one around, and Peter\u2019s voice was getting a little too fast and his breathing too rapid for Tony to let this go on any longer. He quickened his pace, jogging around to cut the boy off and placed his hands on Peter\u2019s shoulders.</p><p>\u201cPeter.\u201d The boy\u2019s eyes snapped up to meet his. \u00a0\u201cDeep breath, kid. Whatever it is I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll be fine.\u201d Peter\u2019s eyes still looked a little manic, so Tony took care to slow his own breathing and work gentle rhythmic circles into Pete\u2019s shoulder with his thumb to try and ground him.</p><p>\u201cI just-\u201d Peter cut himself off, \u201cI\u2019m not-\u201d He looked frustrated at his inability to get out what he was trying to say. Tony took one of the kid\u2019s hands and placed it on his chest so the boy could time his breathing to his mentor\u2019s. Peter let out a huff and his whole body sagged, his eyes falling to the floor, \u201cI\u2019m bi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Peter.\u201d Tony\u2019s entire demeanor softened. He brought the hand that was still on Peter\u2019s shoulder up to the boy\u2019s cheek, he needed Peter to look at him so he could see his sincerity. \u201cThank you for telling me, bud. I am <i>so happy</i> that you feel comfortable enough with me to do that.\u201d Peter seemed to relax and Tony\u2019s smile grew as he let out a small laugh, \u201cAnd listen, I know that \u2018I know\u2019 isn\u2019t a great response to coming out, but Pete, I didn\u2019t realize it was a secret.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?!\u201d</p><p>Tony knew this was a big moment for the kid so he tried his best not to laugh at the horror on the boy\u2019s face as he extracted himself from his mentor\u2019s hold, but he wouldn\u2019t be him if he didn\u2019t at least tease Peter little bit. \u201cWell, I assume you\u2019re telling me this because you have a crush on Mr. Darcy back there.

He wasn&rsquo;t sure where Peter was taking them, or if the kid even had a place in mind at all and wasn&rsquo;t just dragging him around in circles out of panic. But there was no one around, and Peter&rsquo;s voice was getting a little too fast and his breathing too rapid for Tony to let this go on any longer. He quickened his pace, jogging around to cut the boy off and placed his hands on Peter&rsquo;s shoulders.</p><p>&ldquo;Peter.&rdquo; The boy&rsquo;s eyes snapped up to meet his. &nbsp;&ldquo;Deep breath, kid. Whatever it is I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;ll be fine.&rdquo; Peter&rsquo;s eyes still looked a little manic, so Tony took care to slow his own breathing and work gentle rhythmic circles into Pete&rsquo;s shoulder with his thumb to try and ground him.</p><p>&ldquo;I just-&rdquo; Peter cut himself off, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not-&rdquo; He looked frustrated at his inability to get out what he was trying to say. Tony took one of the kid&rsquo;s hands and placed it on his chest so the boy could time his breathing to his mentor&rsquo;s. Peter let out a huff and his whole body sagged, his eyes falling to the floor, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m bi.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, Peter.&rdquo; Tony&rsquo;s entire demeanor softened. He brought the hand that was still on Peter&rsquo;s shoulder up to the boy&rsquo;s cheek, he needed Peter to look at him so he could see his sincerity. &ldquo;Thank you for telling me, bud. I am <i>so happy</i> that you feel comfortable enough with me to do that.&rdquo; Peter seemed to relax and Tony&rsquo;s smile grew as he let out a small laugh, &ldquo;And listen, I know that &lsquo;I know&rsquo; isn&rsquo;t a great response to coming out, but Pete, I didn&rsquo;t realize it was a secret.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What?!&rdquo;</p><p>Tony knew this was a big moment for the kid so he tried his best not to laugh at the horror on the boy&rsquo;s face as he extracted himself from his mentor&rsquo;s hold, but he wouldn&rsquo;t be him if he didn&rsquo;t at least tease Peter little bit. &ldquo;Well, I assume you&rsquo;re telling me this because you have a crush on Mr. Darcy back there. You haven&rsquo;t exactly been subtle about it, bud.&rdquo;</p><p>An alarmed, choked off noise sprung from the back of Peter&rsquo;s throat. &ldquo;Dude!&rdquo;</p><p>Tony rolled his eyes, &ldquo;Seriously, Pete, I&rsquo;m really happy you told me, but I don&rsquo;t get why we had to run out on Asgard&rsquo;s most eligible bachelor.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, Mr. Stark, maybe you don&rsquo;t understand because you&rsquo;re&hellip;&rdquo; Peter waved his hands up and down at Tony as if that was supposed to explain anything. &ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;re Tony Stark, but most people aren&rsquo;t prepared to meet their celebrity crush on a random Tuesday in the middle of June.&rdquo;</p><p>Okay, so maybe Tony was a little more used to hanging around the rich and famous than your average guy, but he had kind of figured between him and Pepper and the couple other Avengers that Peter had met that the kid was getting pretty used to it too. &ldquo;What are you saying here, Underoos?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m saying&hellip;&rdquo; Peter sighed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m saying I was 11 when the battle of New York happened and that Thor was the first guy I ever had a crush on.&rdquo; He was full on mumbling, cheeks red, staring holes into the floor, embarrassed. Tony would feel bad if it wasn&rsquo;t so goddamn adorable.</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you&hellip;so much for telling me that, I&rsquo;m never letting you live that down.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not the point, Mr. Stark!&rdquo; Tony barked out a laugh at the indignant look on Peter&rsquo;s face and threw an arm around his shoulders.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, bud, I promise to not purposefully embarrass you in front of Thor.&rdquo; He started steering Peter back towards the common room.</p><p>Peter let himself be guided by the older man, but his reluctance was clear on his face and in his crossed arms and as he mumbled, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe you.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony nodded his head solemnly, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s probably smart.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Mr. Stark!&rdquo; Peter stopped in his tracks, a look of pure betrayal covering his face.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, fine!&rdquo; Tony held his arms up in a show of defeat. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s just go back in there. I&rsquo;ll try and keep the conversation off you enough that you can just sit and ogle Thor&rsquo;s muscles.&rdquo; He patted the boy&rsquo;s shoulder and started walking back to the common room.</p><p>&ldquo;I crave death.&rdquo; The kid sounded miserable but Tony could hear him running to catch up with him, so it couldn&rsquo;t be too bad.</p><p>&ldquo;I know, kiddo, but this is so much more fun.&rdquo;</p><hr /><p>The pair re-entered the living room to find Rhodey had joined Thor and was showing him his leg braces.</p><p>&ldquo;Sorry about that. Kid just needed my help with some science stuff.&rdquo;</p><p>Rhodey looked at Tony questioningly. He just winked at his friend and shot him a conspiratory smile as he went to stand beside him, discretely leaning over to whisper, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll see.&rdquo;</p><p>Sure enough, Peter went straight up to the god, seemingly determined to make a better impression. &ldquo;Hi, Mr. Thor. It&rsquo;s an honor to meet you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure it is.&rdquo; Only Thor could say that and still have people like him. If Tony says stuff like that everyone calls him an ass. &ldquo;Rhodey was telling me that you helped with his new robot legs, that&rsquo;s very impressive.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh I, um, I, well,&rdquo; There was the Peter Tony knew and loved. &ldquo;I helped Mr. Stark but I&rsquo;m more a scientist than an engineer.&rdquo; Peter was blushing so hard Tony was surprised there was any blood left in the rest of his body.</p><p>&ldquo;A scientist, you say?&rdquo; Thor looked impressed. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll probably get along well with Banner then. He should be here soon.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Banner?&rdquo; Peter&rsquo;s voice jumped back up about three octaves. &ldquo;As in Dr. Bruce Banner?&rdquo;</p><p>Tony could see Rhodey&rsquo;s smirk out of the corner of his eye. He knew what was coming before the words left his friends mouth, &ldquo;Hey, Blondie, do you know what a fanboy is?&rdquo;</p><p>The look Peter shot them would have been terrifying if it wasn&rsquo;t coming from the kindest kid in the world. &ldquo;I will kill you in your sleep.&rdquo;</p><p>It was good to know he had friends who would tease his kid for him when he couldn&rsquo;t.</p><hr /><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/5319a654fe641d1b35510ce35226b9e3/tumblr_inline_pplz09A4fR1rrr9y4_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure></p>",

        "body": "<h1>In Which Clint Finds Out About Peter\u2019s Pull Ups</h1><p>So this is very close to my style! I write a lot about things like this, Peter acting a bit young. I hope you guys like this :) </p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>Movie night.</p><p><br/></p><p>It was a regular thing at the Avengers compound, and everyone loved it. Being able to step away from everything and just chill out with your family for a few hours might as well have been heaven to them. </p><p><br/></p><p>Getting to hang out with Peter was a bonus too, because, of course, everyone absolutely adored him. </p><p><br/></p><p>So, as it went, it was movie night in the compound, and everyone was hanging out. They&rsquo;d already watched two movies, The Green Mile, courteous of Steve, and The Hobbit, courteous of Peter. They&rsquo;d seen it before, but nobody had the heart to tell him no, especially when he looked so excited picking it out.</p><p><br/></p><p>It was when they were on their third movie that everyone noticed Peter getting tired. It wasn&rsquo;t super obvious, but the subtle shifting towards Tony was the first giveaway. He was already near the man, but he&rsquo;d begun shuffling closer every so often, and everyone nearly cooed aloud. They loved the father son bond between Tony and Peter, and watching them interact made everyone&rsquo;s heart swell in a way they didn&rsquo;t know was possible. </p><p><br/></p><p>It wasn&rsquo;t long before Peter was curled into Tony&rsquo;s side, the boy fisting the mans t shirt as they continued watching the movie. Tony was running his hand up and down Peter&rsquo;s arm, obviously relaxing him. Everyone was still watching the movie, but they couldn&rsquo;t help but steal a glance at the pair every so often. </p><p><br/></p><p>The next sign was the yawning. Peter began to yawn every few minutes, rubbing his eyes after and making them red. It was beyond cute, and he was beyond tired. This time, even Tony started to pay attention to how tired the boy was obviously getting. </p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;Sleepy, kiddo?&rdquo; he asked, and Peter blushed as he shook his head. </p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;You sure?&rdquo; Tony chuckled, knowing it was just like Peter to deny anything wrong with him, even if it was as simple as being ready for bed. </p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;Positive,&rdquo; Peter murmured, and everyone chuckled that time. </p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;Sure, kid. Just let me know when you&rsquo;re actually tired,&rdquo; Tony replied with a smirk, and Peter nodded. </p><p><br/></p><p>Shortly after, yet another sign appeared: whininess. </p><p><br/></p><p>Steve had been sitting on the other end of the couch Peter and Tony were lying on, and while the others picked another movie, he thought it would be funny to start tickling Peter. Knowing he had ticklish feet, Steve immediately took the opportunity to grab his exposed feet. </p><p><br/></p><p>However, he wasn&rsquo;t expecting it to upset Peter. </p><p><br/></p><p>The boy jerked his feet away, giving Steve the meanest look he could muster, which really wasn&rsquo;t mean at all. In response, Steve only grabbed his foot again and tried tickling it, Peter struggling and whining, &ldquo;Stoooop!&rdquo;</p><p><br/></p><p>Steve only continued, to which Peter again whined. This time though, he involved Tony. </p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;Daaad! Tell him to stop!&rdquo; the boy whined, looking up at Tony with frustrated tears in his eyes. He was so, so tired, and Steve was bothering him!</p><p><br/></p><p>Nobody was fazed by Peter calling him dad, as they&rsquo;d all heard it before. However, it was quite funny to hear Peter tattling. </p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;Alright, Rogers,&rdquo; Tony said with a smile. &ldquo;Stop messing with my kid.&rdquo;</p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;You got it, Stark,&rdquo; Steve saluted. He didn&rsquo;t want to bother Peter anymore if it really was bothering him, but he also didn&rsquo;t want to be on Tony&rsquo;s bad side. He&rsquo;d been there before, and he didn&rsquo;t like it. </p><p><br/></p><p>Knowing he&rsquo;d gotten his way, Peter stuck his tongue out at Steve, and the man couldn&rsquo;t help but laugh. The boy was just too cute. </p><p><br/></p><p>+</p><p><br/></p><p>Peter had made it nearly halfway through their fourth movie before Tony had put his foot down. Everyone had noticed the way his eyes were fluttering, and the way he was clinging to Tony in every aspect. </p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;Alright, kiddo. I think it&rsquo;s time you head up for bed,&rdquo; Tony told Peter as he looked down at him. </p><p><br/></p><p>Peter frowned. &ldquo;Do I have to?&rdquo; he asked, rubbing his eye as he sat up. </p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;Yep,&rdquo; Tony popped the P. &ldquo;You do. So go put your pajamas on and you can come back down and say goodnight to everyone.&rdquo; </p><p><br/></p><p>Peter didn&rsquo;t argue and stood up, but Tony grabbed his arm before he could walk away. He whispered something in his ear, and Peter nodded shyly before heading for the elevator. </p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;What was that about?&rdquo; Steve asked, and Tony just shrugged. </p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; he said, and everyone dropped it. If Tony didn&rsquo;t want to tell them, he wasn&rsquo;t going to tell them. </p><p><br/></p><p>A few minutes later, Peter walked back in, now clad in pajamas with a blue fleece blanket in his hand. Everyone knew about the &lsquo;blankie,&rsquo; so they were all used to seeing it. Still, it made their hearts burst when they saw the boy in such an innocent state. </p><p><br/></p><p>Peter made his way around the room, saying his goodnights to everyone and giving hugs, eventually making his way back to Tony where the man stood up to wrap him in a hug and rub his back. He pulled the boys shirt down to cover the top of his pajama bottoms when he noticed something sticking out, and continued rubbing his back as he whispered in his ear. </p><p><br/></p><p>The two continued for a moment longer, Peter eventually pulling away and walking back towards the elevator. Everyone waved at him as he got inside, and the boy waved back. </p><p><br/></p><p>Once he was gone, movie night continued for one more movie, and then eventually everyone else began retiring as well. </p><p><br/></p><p>+</p><p><br/></p><p>Clint and Tony were the only ones still up when Clint popped the question he&rsquo;d been waiting to ask. </p><p><br/></p><p>The two were standing in the kitchen, Tony&rsquo;s back against the island as Clint was leaning against the counter opposite him. </p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;So,&rdquo; Clint started. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s with the pull ups?&rdquo; </p><p><br/></p><p>Tony sputtered on the tea he was drinking. </p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, what?&rdquo; he asked, and Clint gave him a knowing look. </p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;Peter. I saw it poking out of his pajama pants earlier. I&rsquo;m a dad too, you know. I could spot a diaper a mile away.&rdquo;</p><p><br/></p><p>Tony sighed. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s just been having some trouble at night. This was the best solution we could come up with. But don&rsquo;t you dare tell him I told you; he&rsquo;d probably die,&rdquo; he explained. </p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;Hey, I would never say anything. I know what he&rsquo;s like,&rdquo; Clint paused. &ldquo;Can I ask who else knows?&rdquo; </p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;Just Pepper and I,&rdquo; Tony replied. &ldquo;His friend Ned might, too. I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; </p><p><br/></p><p>Clint only nodded in response, and the two continued talking about small things, Clint asking about Tony&rsquo;s projects and Peter, and Tony asking about Laura and the kids. </p><p><br/></p><p>A few minutes later though, Tony noticed a small figure walking up from the shadows, and he knew it was Peter. The boy walked in with his blanket wrapped around his shoulders, hair mussed and eyes tired. </p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;Hey, bud,&rdquo; Tony said quietly. &ldquo;What&rsquo;re you doing up?&rdquo; </p><p><br/></p><p>In response, Peter leaned against him and shrugged. He sighed in content as he laid his shoulder against Tony&rsquo;s chest, waving tiredly at Clint. Clint smiled at the boy in response, and barely noticed as Tony leaned down to check the boys pull up.</p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;Do you wanna go get changed?&rdquo; he whispered, and Peter again gave a tired nod. </p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be right back, Barton,&rdquo; Tony announced, leading Peter to the restroom. They usually only kept pull ups in Peter&rsquo;s bathroom and Tony and Pepper&rsquo;s en-suite, but thankfully they&rsquo;d had a few in the common room bathroom that night. </p><p><br/></p><p>Peter was changed in no time, having only had a light accident, so Tony didn&rsquo;t have much cleaning up to do. They were soon returning to the kitchen, this time with Peter practically draped over Tony, his arms wrapped around the mans neck while Tony&rsquo;s arms supported his bottom. </p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;Alright, I&rsquo;m gonna lay this one down,&rdquo; Tony told Clint. &ldquo;You coming?&rdquo; </p><p><br/></p><p>With a nod, the archer followed Tony all the way up to Peter&rsquo;s room and watched as the man tucked the boy back into his bed. </p><p><br/></p><p>He even heard Peter give a soft whine, followed by Tony murmuring, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s bedtime, kiddo. You&rsquo;re okay in here.&rdquo; He watched as Tony pushed Peter&rsquo;s hair back for a few minutes, waiting for the boy to fall asleep. </p><p><br/></p><p>When Tony walked back out, Clint smiled. &ldquo;It suits you, domestic life.&rdquo; </p><p><br/></p><p>Tony couldn&rsquo;t even roll his eyes like he usually did, because, yeah, Clint was right.</p>",

This time, even Tony started to pay attention to how tired the boy was obviously getting. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cSleepy, kiddo?\u201d he asked, and Peter blushed as he shook his head. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cYou sure?\u201d Tony chuckled, knowing it was just like Peter to deny anything wrong with him, even if it was as simple as being ready for bed. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cPositive,\u201d Peter murmured, and everyone chuckled that time. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cSure, kid. Just let me know when you\u2019re actually tired,\u201d Tony replied with a smirk, and Peter nodded. </p><p><br></p><p>Shortly after, yet another sign appeared: whininess. </p><p><br></p><p>Steve had been sitting on the other end of the couch Peter and Tony were lying on, and while the others picked another movie, he thought it would be funny to start tickling Peter. Knowing he had ticklish feet, Steve immediately took the opportunity to grab his exposed feet. </p><p><br></p><p>However, he wasn\u2019t expecting it to upset Peter. </p><p><br></p><p>The boy jerked his feet away, giving Steve the meanest look he could muster, which really wasn\u2019t mean at all. In response, Steve only grabbed his foot again and tried tickling it, Peter struggling and whining, \u201cStoooop!\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>Steve only continued, to which Peter again whined. This time though, he involved Tony. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cDaaad! Tell him to stop!\u201d the boy whined, looking up at Tony with frustrated tears in his eyes. He was so, so tired, and Steve was bothering him!</p><p><br></p><p>Nobody was fazed by Peter calling him dad, as they\u2019d all heard it before. However, it was quite funny to hear Peter tattling. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cAlright, Rogers,\u201d Tony said with a smile. \u201cStop messing with my kid.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cYou got it, Stark,\u201d Steve saluted. He didn\u2019t want to bother Peter anymore if it really was bothering him, but he also didn\u2019t want to be on Tony\u2019s bad side. He\u2019d been there before, and he didn\u2019t like it. </p><p><br></p><p>Knowing he\u2019d gotten his way, Peter stuck his tongue out at Steve, and the man couldn\u2019t help but laugh. The boy was just too cute. </p><p><br></p><p>+</p><p><br></p><p>Peter had made it nearly halfway through their fourth movie before Tony had put his foot down. Everyone had noticed the way his eyes were fluttering, and the way he was clinging to Tony in every aspect. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cAlright, kiddo. I think it\u2019s time you head up for bed,\u201d Tony told Peter as he looked down at him. </p><p><br></p><p>Peter frowned. \u201cDo I have to?\u201d he asked, rubbing his eye as he sat up. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cYep,\u201d Tony popped the P. \u201cYou do. So go put your pajamas on and you can come back down and say goodnight to everyone.\u201d </p><p><br></p><p>Peter didn\u2019t argue and stood up, but Tony grabbed his arm before he could walk away. He whispered something in his ear, and Peter nodded shyly before heading for the elevator. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cWhat was that about?\u201d Steve asked, and Tony just shrugged. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d he said, and everyone dropped it. If Tony didn\u2019t want to tell them, he wasn\u2019t going to tell them. </p><p><br></p><p>A few minutes later, Peter walked back in, now clad in pajamas with a blue fleece blanket in his hand. Everyone knew about the \u2018blankie,\u2019 so they were all used to seeing it. Still, it made their hearts burst when they saw the boy in such an innocent state. </p><p><br></p><p>Peter made his way around the room, saying his goodnights to everyone and giving hugs, eventually making his way back to Tony where the man stood up to wrap him in a hug and rub his back. He pulled the boys shirt down to cover the top of his pajama bottoms when he noticed something sticking out, and continued rubbing his back as he whispered in his ear. </p><p><br></p><p>The two continued for a moment longer, Peter eventually pulling away and walking back towards the elevator. Everyone waved at him as he got inside, and the boy waved back. </p><p><br></p><p>Once he was gone, movie night continued for one more movie, and then eventually everyone else began retiring as well. </p><p><br></p><p>+</p><p><br></p><p>Clint and Tony were the only ones still up when Clint popped the question he\u2019d been waiting to ask. </p><p><br></p><p>The two were standing in the kitchen, Tony\u2019s back against the island as Clint was leaning against the counter opposite him. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Clint started. \u201cWhat\u2019s with the pull ups?\u201d </p><p><br></p><p>Tony sputtered on the tea he was drinking. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, what?\u201d he asked, and Clint gave him a knowing look. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cPeter. I saw it poking out of his pajama pants earlier. I\u2019m a dad too, you know. I could spot a diaper a mile away.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>Tony sighed. \u201cHe\u2019s just been having some trouble at night. This was the best solution we could come up with. But don\u2019t you dare tell him I told you; he\u2019d probably die,\u201d he explained. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cHey, I would never say anything. I know what he\u2019s like,\u201d Clint paused. \u201cCan I ask who else knows?\u201d </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cJust Pepper and I,\u201d Tony replied. \u201cHis friend Ned might, too. I don\u2019t know.\u201d </p><p><br></p><p>Clint only nodded in response, and the two continued talking about small things, Clint asking about Tony\u2019s projects and Peter, and Tony asking about Laura and the kids. </p><p><br></p><p>A few minutes later though, Tony noticed a small figure walking up from the shadows, and he knew it was Peter. The boy walked in with his blanket wrapped around his shoulders, hair mussed and eyes tired. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cHey, bud,\u201d Tony said quietly. \u201cWhat\u2019re you doing up?\u201d </p><p><br></p><p>In response, Peter leaned against him and shrugged. He sighed in content as he laid his shoulder against Tony\u2019s chest, waving tiredly at Clint. Clint smiled at the boy in response, and barely noticed as Tony leaned down to check the boys pull up.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cDo you wanna go get changed?\u201d he whispered, and Peter again gave a tired nod. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be right back, Barton,\u201d Tony announced, leading Peter to the restroom. They usually only kept pull ups in Peter\u2019s bathroom and Tony and Pepper\u2019s en-suite, but thankfully they\u2019d had a few in the common room bathroom that night. </p><p><br></p><p>Peter was changed in no time, having only had a light accident, so Tony didn\u2019t have much cleaning up to do.

You\u2019re okay in here.\u201d He watched as Tony pushed Peter\u2019s hair back for a few minutes, waiting for the boy to fall asleep. </p><p><br></p><p>When Tony walked back out, Clint smiled. \u201cIt suits you, domestic life.\u201d </p><p><br></p><p>Tony couldn\u2019t even roll his eyes like he usually did, because, yeah, Clint was right.</p></p>",

They\u2019d already watched two movies, The Green Mile, courteous of Steve, and The Hobbit, courteous of Peter. They\u2019d seen it before, but nobody had the heart to tell him no, especially when he looked so excited picking it out.</p><p><br></p><p>It was when they were on their third movie that everyone noticed Peter getting tired. It wasn\u2019t super obvious, but the subtle shifting towards Tony was the first giveaway. He was already near the man, but he\u2019d begun shuffling closer every so often, and everyone nearly cooed aloud. They loved the father son bond between Tony and Peter, and watching them interact made everyone\u2019s heart swell in a way they didn\u2019t know was possible. </p><p><br></p><p>It wasn\u2019t long before Peter was curled into Tony\u2019s side, the boy fisting the mans t shirt as they continued watching the movie. Tony was running his hand up and down Peter\u2019s arm, obviously relaxing him. Everyone was still watching the movie, but they couldn\u2019t help but steal a glance at the pair every so often. </p><p><br></p><p>The next sign was the yawning.

The boy was just too cute. </p><p><br /></p><p>+</p><p><br /></p><p>Peter had made it nearly halfway through their fourth movie before Tony had put his foot down. Everyone had noticed the way his eyes were fluttering, and the way he was clinging to Tony in every aspect. </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Alright, kiddo. I think it&rsquo;s time you head up for bed,&rdquo; Tony told Peter as he looked down at him. </p><p><br /></p><p>Peter frowned. &ldquo;Do I have to?&rdquo; he asked, rubbing his eye as he sat up. </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Yep,&rdquo; Tony popped the P. &ldquo;You do. So go put your pajamas on and you can come back down and say goodnight to everyone.&rdquo; </p><p><br /></p><p>Peter didn&rsquo;t argue and stood up, but Tony grabbed his arm before he could walk away. He whispered something in his ear, and Peter nodded shyly before heading for the elevator. </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;What was that about?&rdquo; Steve asked, and Tony just shrugged. </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; he said, and everyone dropped it. If Tony didn&rsquo;t want to tell them, he wasn&rsquo;t going to tell them. </p><p><br /></p><p>A few minutes later, Peter walked back in, now clad in pajamas with a blue fleece blanket in his hand. Everyone knew about the &lsquo;blankie,&rsquo; so they were all used to seeing it. Still, it made their hearts burst when they saw the boy in such an innocent state. </p><p><br /></p><p>Peter made his way around the room, saying his goodnights to everyone and giving hugs, eventually making his way back to Tony where the man stood up to wrap him in a hug and rub his back. He pulled the boys shirt down to cover the top of his pajama bottoms when he noticed something sticking out, and continued rubbing his back as he whispered in his ear. </p><p><br /></p><p>The two continued for a moment longer, Peter eventually pulling away and walking back towards the elevator. Everyone waved at him as he got inside, and the boy waved back. </p><p><br /></p><p>Once he was gone, movie night continued for one more movie, and then eventually everyone else began retiring as well. </p><p><br /></p><p>+</p><p><br /></p><p>Clint and Tony were the only ones still up when Clint popped the question he&rsquo;d been waiting to ask. </p><p><br /></p><p>The two were standing in the kitchen, Tony&rsquo;s back against the island as Clint was leaning against the counter opposite him. </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;So,&rdquo; Clint started. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s with the pull ups?&rdquo; </p><p><br /></p><p>Tony sputtered on the tea he was drinking. </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, what?&rdquo; he asked, and Clint gave him a knowing look. </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Peter. I saw it poking out of his pajama pants earlier. I&rsquo;m a dad too, you know. I could spot a diaper a mile away.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>Tony sighed. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s just been having some trouble at night. This was the best solution we could come up with. But don&rsquo;t you dare tell him I told you; he&rsquo;d probably die,&rdquo; he explained. </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Hey, I would never say anything. I know what he&rsquo;s like,&rdquo; Clint paused. &ldquo;Can I ask who else knows?&rdquo; </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Just Pepper and I,&rdquo; Tony replied. &ldquo;His friend Ned might, too. I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; </p><p><br /></p><p>Clint only nodded in response, and the two continued talking about small things, Clint asking about Tony&rsquo;s projects and Peter, and Tony asking about Laura and the kids. </p><p><br /></p><p>A few minutes later though, Tony noticed a small figure walking up from the shadows, and he knew it was Peter. The boy walked in with his blanket wrapped around his shoulders, hair mussed and eyes tired. </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Hey, bud,&rdquo; Tony said quietly. &ldquo;What&rsquo;re you doing up?&rdquo; </p><p><br /></p><p>In response, Peter leaned against him and shrugged. He sighed in content as he laid his shoulder against Tony&rsquo;s chest, waving tiredly at Clint. Clint smiled at the boy in response, and barely noticed as Tony leaned down to check the boys pull up.</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Do you wanna go get changed?&rdquo; he whispered, and Peter again gave a tired nod. </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be right back, Barton,&rdquo; Tony announced, leading Peter to the restroom. They usually only kept pull ups in Peter&rsquo;s bathroom and Tony and Pepper&rsquo;s en-suite, but thankfully they&rsquo;d had a few in the common room bathroom that night. </p><p><br /></p><p>Peter was changed in no time, having only had a light accident, so Tony didn&rsquo;t have much cleaning up to do. They were soon returning to the kitchen, this time with Peter practically draped over Tony, his arms wrapped around the mans neck while Tony&rsquo;s arms supported his bottom. </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Alright, I&rsquo;m gonna lay this one down,&rdquo; Tony told Clint. &ldquo;You coming?&rdquo; </p><p><br /></p><p>With a nod, the archer followed Tony all the way up to Peter&rsquo;s room and watched as the man tucked the boy back into his bed. </p><p><br /></p><p>He even heard Peter give a soft whine, followed by Tony murmuring, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s bedtime, kiddo. You&rsquo;re okay in here.&rdquo; He watched as Tony pushed Peter&rsquo;s hair back for a few minutes, waiting for the boy to fall asleep. </p><p><br /></p><p>When Tony walked back out, Clint smiled. &ldquo;It suits you, domestic life.&rdquo; </p><p><br /></p><p>Tony couldn&rsquo;t even roll his eyes like he usually did, because, yeah, Clint was right.</p></p>",

He\u2019d love to hear of your experiences, practices and stories from the Bible, fully invested in understanding and appreciating it, and would love to educate you on his own beliefs and Wakandan traditions in regards to them.</p><hr><h2><b>Stephen Strange</b></h2><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"225\" data-orig-width=\"400\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"docty-strange:xIRU-5ANRIiS92rdRX5acg:ZoEkrb2aV6pB1\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/46cc31469f1a700e5f61a56224054a20/tumblr_pcxd1ug3021wkrr16o1_400.gif\" data-orig-height=\"225\" data-orig-width=\"400\"/></figure><p><b></b></p><p>Stephen, as a surgeon, would at first disregard your religion.

He\u2019d love you anyways, of course, but he\u2019d be callous and unwelcoming to your opinions about greater things than science.</p><p>Until he finally sees things beyond science. When he finds his true calling as a sorcerer, he\u2019d probably be embarrassed at how closed-minded he\u2019d been. He\u2019d apologise a whole lot and find a new appreciation for your religion and dedication, finally realising that it\u2019s much more possible than he always thought it was.</p><hr><h2><b>Thor Odinson</b></h2><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"150\" data-orig-width=\"268\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"steve-rogers:ifGbkvSJbj8zpTqWq_-_XQ:ZUwAwq2hLOcL9\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/cb0309fcb27e208f30cecd43f100636e/tumblr_ppgnw7dVHX1sdiuwlo2_r3_400.gif\" data-orig-height=\"150\" data-orig-width=\"268\"/></figure><p><b></b></p><p>Thor wouldn\u2019t get it. He would understand the concept of God, and then point to himself, claiming that you were already romantically involved with God. When you try to explain further, he\u2019d perhaps talk about his own father and claim that you meant him. Further explanations would only lead to him growing frustrated, demanding to the sky that your God show himself and come down to battle it out with him, becoming furious and calling him a coward when nothing happens, though softening when he notices you laughing and shaking your head.</p><p>It\u2019d be tough to explain to him and you\u2019d have to settle for telling him you don\u2019t know the technicalities, only that you believe in it all, and that it\u2019s enough for you. It\u2019d take some convincing but he\u2019d eventually let the matter drop and learn all he can about it and grow a firm appreciation. Though sometimes, when he\u2019s bored, he may get on his knees to pray and hope that whoever you believe in can hear his invitations to duels.</p><blockquote><p><i>written by: archie</i></p></blockquote>",

Shaking my head repeatedly in disbelieve I got into my car and\ndrove away. There were some things the psychic told me that I could get behind.\nLike the fact that I\u2019m still going to live my lavish lifestyle for years to\ncome or that I\u2019m going to be Iron Man for at least a few more years. One thing\nI didn\u2019t expect thought, was the fact that she told me exactly just who my\nsoulmate is. I was pretty sure that I never met a woman like her before in my\nlife, despite the Psychic telling me that I definitely know her. Not even the\nname was ringing any bells in my head.</p><p>Arriving at the Avengers Tower I went straight to the living\narea where some of my team mates were seated around the coffee table in front\nof the TV, everyone saying something, but I didn\u2019t pay them any attention. I\nwalked straight to the kitchen, still in my own world.</p><p>I tried my hardest to go through every woman I ever met,\nwhich was a struggle considering my past. I couldn\u2019t remember a woman like her,\nnone of the descriptions given by the Psychic matched, let alone the name. I\nwas still so consumed by my own thoughts that Sam\u2019s voice asking me if I was\nalright didn\u2019t reach me.</p><p>\u201cYou plan on eating that orange with the peel or?\u201d Sam spoke\na little louder and I lifted my head to look at him. </p><p>I saw the confused looks on everyone\u2019s face and just now realized\nthat I\u2019ve been holding an orange in my right hand for a few minutes. Still\nconfused by everything I thought the best thing to do was to ask my friends for\nhelp.</p><p>\u201cYou guys know anyone named y/n y/l/n?\u201d </p><p>Sam and Natasha shook their heads, not really sure why I\nneeded that kind of information. Bruce on the other hand knew exactly who I was\nasking for.</p><p>\u201cActually, my partner down in the lab, her name is y/n y/l/n.\u201d\n</p><p>My eyes widened and finally let go of the orange in my hand.\nI could not believe that she was right here the entire time apparently. How did\nI not question her being an employee of mine? </p><p>-</p><p>Waking up the next day with the Psychics words still on my\nmind, I had the urge to talk about it to someone. I made my way to the kitchen\nin hopes of finding anyone awake by eight in the morning. I walked down the\nmany corridors arriving at the kitchen. As soon as I entered the room I could\nsee Steve sitting at the breakfast bar, eating toast. Taking the seat next to\nhim I wondered if it was a good idea to talk to Steve about this of all people.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not the most reliable source for love advice, but\nyou\u2019re the only one awake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou neither, Tony.\u201d</p><p>For some reason I couldn\u2019t get the words out, having second\nthoughts about it. Now come to think of it, it does sound ridiculous.</p><p>\u201cLook, you won\u2019t believe me, but just give me your opinion.\u201d\nI turned my head to see Steve\u2019s confused expression.</p><p>\u201cOk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI went to this Psychic yesterday and I know what you\u2019re\nthinking but-. \u201c Breathing in some air I plugged up the courage to say what\u2019s\nbeen bugging me since yesterday. \u201cShe told me things like, that I\u2019m going to be\nIron Man for a long period of time, thank god and that I won\u2019t go broke, you\nknow, I\u2019m going to be driving my nice Ferrari and have my expensive suits and-\u201c</p><p>\u201cTony!\u201d Steve cut me off, making me jump slightly.</p><p>\u201cOh sorry.\u201d I ran my hands across my face to collect myself.\n\u201cShe also told me who my soulmate is.\u201d</p><p>Steve broke out in laughter as that sentence left my lips. \u201cC\u2019mon\nTony, do you really believe that?\u201d</p><p>I held my pointer finger up in his face, trying to shut him\nup. \u201cNo! She described her every detail like hair colour, eye colour and she even\ntold me her name. That can\u2019t be a coincident.\u201d</p><p>Steve got up from his seat, walking to the sink and placing\nthe plate in it. He leaned against the counter, looking at me with a mocking\nsmile on his face. \u201cAnd who is the poor young lady that has to spend the rest\nof her life with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust shut up, Steve. At least I have a soulmate.\u201d Steve\nkept his gaze on me, patiently waiting. \u201cY/n from the lab.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? You two have never exchanged a word. Even I talked to\nher a couple times\u201d </p><p>\u201cI know!\u201d </p><p>I could tell by his expression that Steve was just as\nconfused about this as I am. He crossed his arms in front of his chest. \u201cYou\nshould talk to her.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know about that.\u201d</p><p>I got up from my seat as well and made myself a cup of\ncoffee. Steve walked past me and firmly patted my shoulder.</p><p>\u201cHow else is she going to get to know you and cursing at the\nuniverse for her fate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up.\u201d</p><p>As Steve exited the room, I thought about his advice. If the\nPsychic was right, then I should make a move. I took my cup and headed a few\nfloors down. </p><p>I stood in front of the door and contemplated whether this\nwas a good idea or not. I ultimately walked back down the corridor and back to\nthe door numerous times, nervous for some odd reason. This is very out of\ncharacter for me and I have no idea why I\u2019m so hesitant to talk to a woman, I\u2019ve\ndone it a lot before.</p><p>\u201cNo, this is dumb.\u201d </p><p>I backed away from the door again with intention to never\nwalk towards it again. But Steve\u2019s words echoed in my brain. I probably looked\nlike an idiot and if someone saw me, they would agree.</p><p>\u201cActually?\u201d</p><p>Making my way back to the door, I opened it this time and\nentered the room. I looked around, examining every face to find the one I\u2019m\nlooking for. I looked at every woman I passed carefully, making sure I don\u2019t\nmiss her. Slowly walking further into the room I spotted her. All the way back\nsitting at a desk, typing. She definitely looks like the woman the Psychic\ndescribed. Every detail matched and my nerves grew more and more as I\napproached her.</p><p>\u201cGood morning.\u201d I said just loud enough for her to hear, the\nnervousness noticeable in my voice. </p><p>She lifted her head to look at me and smiled. \u201cOh, good\nmorning mister Stark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust call me Tony.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOk Tony. What can I do for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are you from?\u201d I regretted the question the moment it\ncame out of my mouth and wanted to disintegrate into dust.</p><p>She looked at me with justified confusion. \u201cI\u2019m from New\nJersey.\u201d \u00a0</p><p>I just nodded my head trying to behave as normal as\npossible. \u201cHow did you find out about the Avengers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this a job interview? Because I could swear I already\ndid that three years ago.\u201d She let out a small giggle and I felt my cheeks\nwarming up, knowing they were bright red by now.</p><p>\u201cYeah I\u2019m sorry.\u201d I tried covering my nerves by laughing. \u201cI\u2019m\ngonna go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOk Tony, have a great day. I hope I got the job.\u201d She\nsmirked and placed her right hand over her chest. </p><p>As soon as I made it out of the lab, I leaned my back\nagainst the door and let out a long breath. It felt like as if I wasn\u2019t\nbreathing the entire time I was in there.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell was that?\u201d</p><p><b>Permanent Taglist: (Open)</b><br/><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mKDwbu6idiycGZPI41sQ31g\">@fuckthatfeeling</a> // <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m4iyS2o_owT0ZpgfjuwVYzA\">@funkenniffler</a> // <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_YBoTKnxLeikp-LyTINIQA\">@void-imaginations</a> // <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYnxNKioOY3cLPsoD91rItQ\">@dewy-biitch</a> // <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m4f07Hm_v85MnuHqIz94F1Q\">@hearttoearth</a> // <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m7leJ-b6BfS1yqMbN4VKnSQ\">@v-2bucky</a> // <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mGLRQUOseCzaWv7vgxeN9pg\">@sebbysstangirl</a> // <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mL2qytzGW4x09v2pLTTUVwg\">@wwhitewwolff</a> // <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mpgl9DmFVFchSsR4FZqqiNA\">@lovely-geek</a> // <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYbAqgb7WYDFTUFdUj62Fyg\">@winchesterspilots</a> // <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m2OjBPVNcdYObwymiIYU1xA\">@aunty-peggy</a> // @sakurashortstack</p>",

Shaking my head repeatedly in disbelieve I got into my car and\ndrove away. There were some things the psychic told me that I could get behind.\nLike the fact that I\u2019m still going to live my lavish lifestyle for years to\ncome or that I\u2019m going to be Iron Man for at least a few more years. One thing\nI didn\u2019t expect thought, was the fact that she told me exactly just who my\nsoulmate is. I was pretty sure that I never met a woman like her before in my\nlife, despite the Psychic telling me that I definitely know her. Not even the\nname was ringing any bells in my head.</p><p>Arriving at the Avengers Tower I went straight to the living\narea where some of my team mates were seated around the coffee table in front\nof the TV, everyone saying something, but I didn\u2019t pay them any attention. I\nwalked straight to the kitchen, still in my own world.</p><p>I tried my hardest to go through every woman I ever met,\nwhich was a struggle considering my past. I couldn\u2019t remember a woman like her,\nnone of the descriptions given by the Psychic matched, let alone the name. I\nwas still so consumed by my own thoughts that Sam\u2019s voice asking me if I was\nalright didn\u2019t reach me.</p><p>\u201cYou plan on eating that orange with the peel or?\u201d Sam spoke\na little louder and I lifted my head to look at him. </p><p>I saw the confused looks on everyone\u2019s face and just now realized\nthat I\u2019ve been holding an orange in my right hand for a few minutes. Still\nconfused by everything I thought the best thing to do was to ask my friends for\nhelp.</p><p>\u201cYou guys know anyone named y/n y/l/n?\u201d </p><p>Sam and Natasha shook their heads, not really sure why I\nneeded that kind of information. Bruce on the other hand knew exactly who I was\nasking for.</p><p>\u201cActually, my partner down in the lab, her name is y/n y/l/n.\u201d\n</p><p>My eyes widened and finally let go of the orange in my hand.\nI could not believe that she was right here the entire time apparently. How did\nI not question her being an employee of mine? </p><p>-</p><p>Waking up the next day with the Psychics words still on my\nmind, I had the urge to talk about it to someone. I made my way to the kitchen\nin hopes of finding anyone awake by eight in the morning. I walked down the\nmany corridors arriving at the kitchen. As soon as I entered the room I could\nsee Steve sitting at the breakfast bar, eating toast. Taking the seat next to\nhim I wondered if it was a good idea to talk to Steve about this of all people.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not the most reliable source for love advice, but\nyou\u2019re the only one awake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou neither, Tony.\u201d</p><p>For some reason I couldn\u2019t get the words out, having second\nthoughts about it. Now come to think of it, it does sound ridiculous.</p><p>\u201cLook, you won\u2019t believe me, but just give me your opinion.\u201d\nI turned my head to see Steve\u2019s confused expression.</p><p>\u201cOk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI went to this Psychic yesterday and I know what you\u2019re\nthinking but-. \u201c Breathing in some air I plugged up the courage to say what\u2019s\nbeen bugging me since yesterday. \u201cShe told me things like, that I\u2019m going to be\nIron Man for a long period of time, thank god and that I won\u2019t go broke, you\nknow, I\u2019m going to be driving my nice Ferrari and have my expensive suits and-\u201c</p><p>\u201cTony!\u201d Steve cut me off, making me jump slightly.</p><p>\u201cOh sorry.\u201d I ran my hands across my face to collect myself.\n\u201cShe also told me who my soulmate is.\u201d</p><p>Steve broke out in laughter as that sentence left my lips. \u201cC\u2019mon\nTony, do you really believe that?\u201d</p><p>I held my pointer finger up in his face, trying to shut him\nup. \u201cNo! She described her every detail like hair colour, eye colour and she even\ntold me her name. That can\u2019t be a coincident.\u201d</p><p>Steve got up from his seat, walking to the sink and placing\nthe plate in it. He leaned against the counter, looking at me with a mocking\nsmile on his face. \u201cAnd who is the poor young lady that has to spend the rest\nof her life with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust shut up, Steve. At least I have a soulmate.\u201d Steve\nkept his gaze on me, patiently waiting. \u201cY/n from the lab.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? You two have never exchanged a word. Even I talked to\nher a couple times\u201d </p><p>\u201cI know!\u201d </p><p>I could tell by his expression that Steve was just as\nconfused about this as I am. He crossed his arms in front of his chest. \u201cYou\nshould talk to her.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know about that.\u201d</p><p>I got up from my seat as well and made myself a cup of\ncoffee. Steve walked past me and firmly patted my shoulder.</p><p>\u201cHow else is she going to get to know you and cursing at the\nuniverse for her fate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up.\u201d</p><p>As Steve exited the room, I thought about his advice. If the\nPsychic was right, then I should make a move. I took my cup and headed a few\nfloors down. </p><p>I stood in front of the door and contemplated whether this\nwas a good idea or not. I ultimately walked back down the corridor and back to\nthe door numerous times, nervous for some odd reason. This is very out of\ncharacter for me and I have no idea why I\u2019m so hesitant to talk to a woman, I\u2019ve\ndone it a lot before.</p><p>\u201cNo, this is dumb.\u201d </p><p>I backed away from the door again with intention to never\nwalk towards it again. But Steve\u2019s words echoed in my brain. I probably looked\nlike an idiot and if someone saw me, they would agree.</p><p>\u201cActually?\u201d</p><p>Making my way back to the door, I opened it this time and\nentered the room. I looked around, examining every face to find the one I\u2019m\nlooking for. I looked at every woman I passed carefully, making sure I don\u2019t\nmiss her. Slowly walking further into the room I spotted her. All the way back\nsitting at a desk, typing. She definitely looks like the woman the Psychic\ndescribed. Every detail matched and my nerves grew more and more as I\napproached her.</p><p>\u201cGood morning.\u201d I said just loud enough for her to hear, the\nnervousness noticeable in my voice. </p><p>She lifted her head to look at me and smiled. \u201cOh, good\nmorning mister Stark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust call me Tony.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOk Tony. What can I do for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are you from?\u201d I regretted the question the moment it\ncame out of my mouth and wanted to disintegrate into dust.</p><p>She looked at me with justified confusion. \u201cI\u2019m from New\nJersey.\u201d \u00a0</p><p>I just nodded my head trying to behave as normal as\npossible. \u201cHow did you find out about the Avengers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this a job interview? Because I could swear I already\ndid that three years ago.\u201d She let out a small giggle and I felt my cheeks\nwarming up, knowing they were bright red by now.</p><p>\u201cYeah I\u2019m sorry.\u201d I tried covering my nerves by laughing. \u201cI\u2019m\ngonna go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOk Tony, have a great day. I hope I got the job.\u201d She\nsmirked and placed her right hand over her chest. </p><p>As soon as I made it out of the lab, I leaned my back\nagainst the door and let out a long breath. It felt like as if I wasn\u2019t\nbreathing the entire time I was in there.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell was that?\u201d</p><p><b>Permanent Taglist: (Open)</b><br><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mKDwbu6idiycGZPI41sQ31g\">@fuckthatfeeling</a> // <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m4iyS2o_owT0ZpgfjuwVYzA\">@funkenniffler</a> // <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_YBoTKnxLeikp-LyTINIQA\">@void-imaginations</a> // <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYnxNKioOY3cLPsoD91rItQ\">@dewy-biitch</a> // <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m4f07Hm_v85MnuHqIz94F1Q\">@hearttoearth</a> // <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m7leJ-b6BfS1yqMbN4VKnSQ\">@v-2bucky</a> // <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mGLRQUOseCzaWv7vgxeN9pg\">@sebbysstangirl</a> // <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mL2qytzGW4x09v2pLTTUVwg\">@wwhitewwolff</a> // <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mpgl9DmFVFchSsR4FZqqiNA\">@lovely-geek</a> // <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYbAqgb7WYDFTUFdUj62Fyg\">@winchesterspilots</a> // <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m2OjBPVNcdYObwymiIYU1xA\">@aunty-peggy</a> // @sakurashortstack</p>",

Shaking my head repeatedly in disbelieve I got into my car and\ndrove away. There were some things the psychic told me that I could get behind.\nLike the fact that I&rsquo;m still going to live my lavish lifestyle for years to\ncome or that I&rsquo;m going to be Iron Man for at least a few more years. One thing\nI didn&rsquo;t expect thought, was the fact that she told me exactly just who my\nsoulmate is. I was pretty sure that I never met a woman like her before in my\nlife, despite the Psychic telling me that I definitely know her. Not even the\nname was ringing any bells in my head.</p><p>Arriving at the Avengers Tower I went straight to the living\narea where some of my team mates were seated around the coffee table in front\nof the TV, everyone saying something, but I didn&rsquo;t pay them any attention. I\nwalked straight to the kitchen, still in my own world.</p><p>I tried my hardest to go through every woman I ever met,\nwhich was a struggle considering my past. I couldn&rsquo;t remember a woman like her,\nnone of the descriptions given by the Psychic matched, let alone the name. I\nwas still so consumed by my own thoughts that Sam&rsquo;s voice asking me if I was\nalright didn&rsquo;t reach me.</p><p>&ldquo;You plan on eating that orange with the peel or?&rdquo; Sam spoke\na little louder and I lifted my head to look at him. </p><p>I saw the confused looks on everyone&rsquo;s face and just now realized\nthat I&rsquo;ve been holding an orange in my right hand for a few minutes. Still\nconfused by everything I thought the best thing to do was to ask my friends for\nhelp.</p><p>&ldquo;You guys know anyone named y/n y/l/n?&rdquo; </p><p>Sam and Natasha shook their heads, not really sure why I\nneeded that kind of information. Bruce on the other hand knew exactly who I was\nasking for.</p><p>&ldquo;Actually, my partner down in the lab, her name is y/n y/l/n.&rdquo;\n</p><p>My eyes widened and finally let go of the orange in my hand.\nI could not believe that she was right here the entire time apparently. How did\nI not question her being an employee of mine? </p><p>-</p><p>Waking up the next day with the Psychics words still on my\nmind, I had the urge to talk about it to someone. I made my way to the kitchen\nin hopes of finding anyone awake by eight in the morning. I walked down the\nmany corridors arriving at the kitchen. As soon as I entered the room I could\nsee Steve sitting at the breakfast bar, eating toast. Taking the seat next to\nhim I wondered if it was a good idea to talk to Steve about this of all people.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not the most reliable source for love advice, but\nyou&rsquo;re the only one awake.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You neither, Tony.&rdquo;</p><p>For some reason I couldn&rsquo;t get the words out, having second\nthoughts about it. Now come to think of it, it does sound ridiculous.</p><p>&ldquo;Look, you won&rsquo;t believe me, but just give me your opinion.&rdquo;\nI turned my head to see Steve&rsquo;s confused expression.</p><p>&ldquo;Ok?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I went to this Psychic yesterday and I know what you&rsquo;re\nthinking but-. &ldquo; Breathing in some air I plugged up the courage to say what&rsquo;s\nbeen bugging me since yesterday. &ldquo;She told me things like, that I&rsquo;m going to be\nIron Man for a long period of time, thank god and that I won&rsquo;t go broke, you\nknow, I&rsquo;m going to be driving my nice Ferrari and have my expensive suits and-&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Tony!&rdquo; Steve cut me off, making me jump slightly.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh sorry.&rdquo; I ran my hands across my face to collect myself.\n&ldquo;She also told me who my soulmate is.&rdquo;</p><p>Steve broke out in laughter as that sentence left my lips. &ldquo;C&rsquo;mon\nTony, do you really believe that?&rdquo;</p><p>I held my pointer finger up in his face, trying to shut him\nup. &ldquo;No! She described her every detail like hair colour, eye colour and she even\ntold me her name. That can&rsquo;t be a coincident.&rdquo;</p><p>Steve got up from his seat, walking to the sink and placing\nthe plate in it. He leaned against the counter, looking at me with a mocking\nsmile on his face. &ldquo;And who is the poor young lady that has to spend the rest\nof her life with you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Just shut up, Steve. At least I have a soulmate.&rdquo; Steve\nkept his gaze on me, patiently waiting. &ldquo;Y/n from the lab.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What? You two have never exchanged a word. Even I talked to\nher a couple times&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I know!&rdquo; </p><p>I could tell by his expression that Steve was just as\nconfused about this as I am. He crossed his arms in front of his chest. &ldquo;You\nshould talk to her.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about that.&rdquo;</p><p>I got up from my seat as well and made myself a cup of\ncoffee. Steve walked past me and firmly patted my shoulder.</p><p>&ldquo;How else is she going to get to know you and cursing at the\nuniverse for her fate?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Shut up.&rdquo;</p><p>As Steve exited the room, I thought about his advice. If the\nPsychic was right, then I should make a move. I took my cup and headed a few\nfloors down. </p><p>I stood in front of the door and contemplated whether this\nwas a good idea or not. I ultimately walked back down the corridor and back to\nthe door numerous times, nervous for some odd reason. This is very out of\ncharacter for me and I have no idea why I&rsquo;m so hesitant to talk to a woman, I&rsquo;ve\ndone it a lot before.</p><p>&ldquo;No, this is dumb.&rdquo; </p><p>I backed away from the door again with intention to never\nwalk towards it again. But Steve&rsquo;s words echoed in my brain. I probably looked\nlike an idiot and if someone saw me, they would agree.</p><p>&ldquo;Actually?&rdquo;</p><p>Making my way back to the door, I opened it this time and\nentered the room. I looked around, examining every face to find the one I&rsquo;m\nlooking for. I looked at every woman I passed carefully, making sure I don&rsquo;t\nmiss her. Slowly walking further into the room I spotted her. All the way back\nsitting at a desk, typing. She definitely looks like the woman the Psychic\ndescribed. Every detail matched and my nerves grew more and more as I\napproached her.</p><p>&ldquo;Good morning.&rdquo; I said just loud enough for her to hear, the\nnervousness noticeable in my voice. </p><p>She lifted her head to look at me and smiled. &ldquo;Oh, good\nmorning mister Stark.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Just call me Tony.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Ok Tony. What can I do for you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Where are you from?&rdquo; I regretted the question the moment it\ncame out of my mouth and wanted to disintegrate into dust.</p><p>She looked at me with justified confusion. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m from New\nJersey.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p><p>I just nodded my head trying to behave as normal as\npossible. &ldquo;How did you find out about the Avengers?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Is this a job interview? Because I could swear I already\ndid that three years ago.&rdquo; She let out a small giggle and I felt my cheeks\nwarming up, knowing they were bright red by now.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo; I tried covering my nerves by laughing. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m\ngonna go.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ok Tony, have a great day. I hope I got the job.&rdquo; She\nsmirked and placed her right hand over her chest. </p><p>As soon as I made it out of the lab, I leaned my back\nagainst the door and let out a long breath.
