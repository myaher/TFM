        "body": "<p>I have gotten a ton of asks in recent days asking who was on set for how long and with who and what we know about the filming of the finale so I\u2019m just going to make this post and lay out all that we know from social media about what was going on during the last week of production. 3x20 (in airing order) was filmed over 6 days rather than 5 because it was initially going to be a full 30 minutes without commercials before Stoney was arrested and 4 scenes were cut off the top of the episode which bumped it back down into the normal range. Our friends at Yun Casting put out a call for teen extras 13-15 years old for 5 of those days. To sum up: Luke and Garren were on set for 3 days each, Emily for 2 days, and Raquel for 1. Anson is listed on imdb for the finale though he was never spotted on set, presumably he only had one day of filming and only a very brief scene if he is actually in the finale.</p><p><b>Tuesday December 11th 2018:</b></p><p>Garren was filming on a residential street during the day, Sofia wasn\u2019t spotted but she must have been there, this scene likely takes place the day of the party but before the party starts. There\u2019s a possibility based on a crew member\u2019s later post that they filmed a night time scene in front of the Mack house as well but there\u2019s no confirmation. No other actors were confirmed as being on set that day for the finale.Teen extras were needed for this day. This is the only confirmed outdoor scene we have for the finale.</p><p>It should be noted that they didn\u2019t do a full day of filming for the finale, as for part of the day they were doing pick ups with Peyton, Lilan, Lauren, Trent, and Stoney inside a car for some driving scenes in 3x19 for the Mack family road trip, these scenes were later re-shot in February. They didn\u2019t film anything Wednesday and resumed production on Thursday.</p><p><b>Thursday December 13th 2018:</b></p><p>The only confirmed actors on set this day were Trent, Lilan, and Peyton. However, Stoney was back in SLC and would be arrested the next day and Lauren was never spotted on set even though we know she has scenes so this must have been the day they filmed the 4 cut scenes as there just wasn\u2019t any other time they could have been filmed. Josh described the 4 scenes as being cut from the top of the ep which fits with them being Celia and Ham\u2019s farewell to their family before leaving. Celia is mentioned as leaving in the finale description so they must have been able to salvage some Celia scenes or re-shoot them. Teen extras were needed for this day. There\u2019s at least one scene at the Mack apartment they filmed this day and it seems to be the scene where Bex and Andi decide to go find stuff to wear while Bowie is with them at the apartment.\u00a0It\u2019s unknown if they filmed any scenes for the Red Rooster or Cloud 10 this day or just stuck to the Mack house and Mack apartment.</p><p><b>Friday December 14th 2018:</b></p><p>This was the only day all the main and recurring kids were on set. Peyton, Josh, Sofia, Asher, Luke, Garren, Emily, and Raquel were all on set in wardrobe. Lilan was on set but it\u2019s unknown if she was filming and Trent was hiking in Moab desert that day.\u00a0</p><p>Raquel posted on her story from the school room and only her and Luke were there which fits with there being a short TJ and Kira solo scene in the finale. After she finished school she posted saying that she was going to hang out on set until they wrapped and it was still daylight out.This was Raquel\u2019s only day on set. Teen extras were needed for this day.</p><p>It was Josh\u2019s 17th birthday and the cast and crew took the time to celebrate on set. Terri was also there that day and seemed to stay in Utah until production wrapped. Stoney was arrested later that night and immediately fired.\u00a0</p><p>The only other day during production of S3 when all the main and recurring kids were on set was the day they filmed the scenes in or around the school for 3x13 which gives a rough idea of the kind of screen time and character interactions we might see.\u00a0</p><p><b>Saturday December 15th 2018:</b></p><p>Peyton, Josh, Sofia, Asher, Luke, Garren, Emily, Lilan, and Trent were all on set this day. Teen extras were needed for this day. Any post bench scene Tyrus scenes would had to have been filmed either Friday or Saturday.</p><p>The cast capped off the day by having a silly string fight outside while some of them were still in wardrobe. Josh had some silly string on him after finishing filming Mack Chat so he likely has a silly string fight with the Mack Chat kids in their last ep. It\u2019s unknown if we\u2019ll actually see any silly string fights on screen, like we did at the original party in 1x04, or if it was just something the cast did to have some fun after wrapping.\u00a0This was Garren and Emily\u2019s last day on set.</p><p><b>Tuesday December 18th 2018:</b></p><p>This was when the bench scene was filmed and was likely scheduled to take advantage of the fact that Josh was now 17 and could work a bit longer and work the same hours as Luke who was already 17. Josh and Luke were the only kids on set this day. Lilan and Trent were also on set. It seems very possible that they filmed some sort of scene(s) between Cyrus, TJ, Bex, and Bowie in some combination either individually or as couples. Lilan hinted at Fan Fest 2019 that we\u2019d see characters we\u2019ve never seen interacting before have scenes and it\u2019s likely that at least in part, she was referring to Bex having scenes with new characters and even a brief scene with TJ would fit that description. They also had 3 other days that they could have filmed any solo Bexie scenes which further points to them having some interaction with Tyrus.\u00a0Teen extras were needed for this day. This was Luke\u2019s last day on set.</p><p><b>Wednesday December 19th 2018:</b></p><p>The very last day of filming (before the re-shoots). Only Peyton, Josh, Sofia, Asher, Lilan, and Trent were on set this day, all of the recurring actors were gone by this point. The casting notice for teen extras didn\u2019t include this date, though it\u2019s possible they could have changed their minds and gotten some extras. This day was probably for any pre or post party scenes and any solo scenes between the mains. It seems that the clip of the GHC + Jonah hugging in front of Andi Shack and Bex telling Andi she made a lot of memories there were filmed this day.\u00a0</p>",

Our friends at Yun Casting put out a call for teen extras 13-15 years old for 5 of those days. To sum up: Luke and Garren were on set for 3 days each, Emily for 2 days, and Raquel for 1. Anson is listed on imdb for the finale though he was never spotted on set, presumably he only had one day of filming and only a very brief scene if he is actually in the finale.</p><p><b>Tuesday December 11th 2018:</b></p><p>Garren was filming on a residential street during the day, Sofia wasn\u2019t spotted but she must have been there, this scene likely takes place the day of the party but before the party starts. There\u2019s a possibility based on a crew member\u2019s later post that they filmed a night time scene in front of the Mack house as well but there\u2019s no confirmation. No other actors were confirmed as being on set that day for the finale.Teen extras were needed for this day. This is the only confirmed outdoor scene we have for the finale.</p><p>It should be noted that they didn\u2019t do a full day of filming for the finale, as for part of the day they were doing pick ups with Peyton, Lilan, Lauren, Trent, and Stoney inside a car for some driving scenes in 3x19 for the Mack family road trip, these scenes were later re-shot in February. They didn\u2019t film anything Wednesday and resumed production on Thursday.</p><p><b>Thursday December 13th 2018:</b></p><p>The only confirmed actors on set this day were Trent, Lilan, and Peyton. However, Stoney was back in SLC and would be arrested the next day and Lauren was never spotted on set even though we know she has scenes so this must have been the day they filmed the 4 cut scenes as there just wasn\u2019t any other time they could have been filmed. Josh described the 4 scenes as being cut from the top of the ep which fits with them being Celia and Ham\u2019s farewell to their family before leaving. Celia is mentioned as leaving in the finale description so they must have been able to salvage some Celia scenes or re-shoot them. Teen extras were needed for this day. There\u2019s at least one scene at the Mack apartment they filmed this day and it seems to be the scene where Bex and Andi decide to go find stuff to wear while Bowie is with them at the apartment.\u00a0It\u2019s unknown if they filmed any scenes for the Red Rooster or Cloud 10 this day or just stuck to the Mack house and Mack apartment.</p><p><b>Friday December 14th 2018:</b></p><p>This was the only day all the main and recurring kids were on set. Peyton, Josh, Sofia, Asher, Luke, Garren, Emily, and Raquel were all on set in wardrobe. Lilan was on set but it\u2019s unknown if she was filming and Trent was hiking in Moab desert that day.\u00a0</p><p>Raquel posted on her story from the school room and only her and Luke were there which fits with there being a short TJ and Kira solo scene in the finale. After she finished school she posted saying that she was going to hang out on set until they wrapped and it was still daylight out.This was Raquel\u2019s only day on set. Teen extras were needed for this day.</p><p>It was Josh\u2019s 17th birthday and the cast and crew took the time to celebrate on set. Terri was also there that day and seemed to stay in Utah until production wrapped. Stoney was arrested later that night and immediately fired.\u00a0</p><p>The only other day during production of S3 when all the main and recurring kids were on set was the day they filmed the scenes in or around the school for 3x13 which gives a rough idea of the kind of screen time and character interactions we might see.\u00a0</p><p><b>Saturday December 15th 2018:</b></p><p>Peyton, Josh, Sofia, Asher, Luke, Garren, Emily, Lilan, and Trent were all on set this day. Teen extras were needed for this day. Any post bench scene Tyrus scenes would had to have been filmed either Friday or Saturday.</p><p>The cast capped off the day by having a silly string fight outside while some of them were still in wardrobe. Josh had some silly string on him after finishing filming Mack Chat so he likely has a silly string fight with the Mack Chat kids in their last ep. It\u2019s unknown if we\u2019ll actually see any silly string fights on screen, like we did at the original party in 1x04, or if it was just something the cast did to have some fun after wrapping.\u00a0This was Garren and Emily\u2019s last day on set.</p><p><b>Tuesday December 18th 2018:</b></p><p>This was when the bench scene was filmed and was likely scheduled to take advantage of the fact that Josh was now 17 and could work a bit longer and work the same hours as Luke who was already 17. Josh and Luke were the only kids on set this day. Lilan and Trent were also on set. It seems very possible that they filmed some sort of scene(s) between Cyrus, TJ, Bex, and Bowie in some combination either individually or as couples. Lilan hinted at Fan Fest 2019 that we\u2019d see characters we\u2019ve never seen interacting before have scenes and it\u2019s likely that at least in part, she was referring to Bex having scenes with new characters and even a brief scene with TJ would fit that description. They also had 3 other days that they could have filmed any solo Bexie scenes which further points to them having some interaction with Tyrus.\u00a0Teen extras were needed for this day. This was Luke\u2019s last day on set.</p><p><b>Wednesday December 19th 2018:</b></p><p>The very last day of filming (before the re-shoots). Only Peyton, Josh, Sofia, Asher, Lilan, and Trent were on set this day, all of the recurring actors were gone by this point. The casting notice for teen extras didn\u2019t include this date, though it\u2019s possible they could have changed their minds and gotten some extras. This day was probably for any pre or post party scenes and any solo scenes between the mains. It seems that the clip of the GHC + Jonah hugging in front of Andi Shack and Bex telling Andi she made a lot of memories there were filmed this day.\u00a0</p>",

Drama ensues. [post 3x15, mostly canon compliant]\n\n</p><p><b>Word Count:\u00a0\n\n</b>3849\n\n</p><p><b><i>[AO3 link in the reblog]</i></b></p><p>~</p><!-- more --><p>\u201cAre you sure this\u2019ll work, Andi?\u201d\nasked Cyrus, frowning slightly as his bracelet.</p><p>The girl flashed him a reassuring smile, giving him a pat on a\nshoulder as she walked past and began busying herself with putting away the\nsupplies they\u2019d used. \u201cTJ will love it, trust me. If he doesn\u2019t, then he has\na\u00a0<i>very</i>\u00a0bad taste in bracelets.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus sighed, leaning back against the confines of the wooden\nchair. He\u2019d spent that Saturday morning at Andi Shack making a bracelet for TJ\nafter some serious convincing from Andi. Truthfully, he was still somewhat\nscarred from the whole shirt fiasco, but the girl had insisted this would be\nmore personal.\u00a0</p><p>Andi turned around again, her smile fading the moment her eyes\nlanded on him. \u201cHey, don\u2019t doubt yourself, okay? He still cares about you, even\nif he\u2019s hanging out with Kira.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus bowed his head. Doubting himself was something he\u2019d become\nparticularly adept at, but somehow, the more he hung out with TJ the less his\nthoughts seemed to take that direction. Lately, he\u2019d been feeling invisible to\nthe boy, and his mind had no problem with reminding him about it endlessly.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think it\u2019s lame?\u201d he asked, voice soft.\u00a0</p><p>A frown appeared on Andi\u2019s face at that. She paused in her\nactions and moved back over to Cyrus, holding out her hands to him. He looked\nup at her with a hesitant smile, taking them and allowing himself to be pulled\nup from his chair.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cCyrus. TJ isn\u2019t like that, okay? He\u2019ll never think you\u2019re lame,\nno matter what. Trust me.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Maybe it was the unwavering way Andi was looking at him, or how\nconfident the words seemed, but Cyrus found himself nodding.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he agreed, smile widening when the girl pulled him in\nfor a tight hug.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d he added in a whisper, and Andi gave him another pat\non the shoulder as they separated.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNo problem. Now - go get your man!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus laughed at that, shaking his head as he made his way over\nto the door.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not my man!\u201d he called over his shoulder as he stepped out\ninto the garden. Andi threw him a disbelieving look and returned to stacking\nher shelves.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cKeep telling yourself that!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus just rolled his eyes. The cool morning had given way to a\nwarm, even\u00a0<i>hot</i>, afternoon. The sky was clear and there was sunlight beaming\ndown on him. He found himself regretting his choice to wear a black shirt, but\nhe pushed the thought aside and concentrated on making his way to the park,<i>without</i>\u00a0somehow\nmanaging to talk himself out of giving TJ the bracelet.</p><p>The walk was a relatively quick one, and by the time he could\nsee the familiar swingset in the distance, he was already beginning to feel\nnervous. His stomach was tying itself into knots, and he came to an abrupt stop\nwhen he spotted TJ there. Alone.\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus took in a deep breath, then another, before squaring his\nshoulders and continuing on his way, approaching the park. The shadows cast\ndown onto him by the trees made the heat somewhat more bearable, and soon\nenough he found himself in almost the exact same position he was before,\nstanding by the park bench near the swings.</p><p>He looked over to the swingset, and when his eyes fell on who\nhad joined TJ his heart sank.\u00a0</p><p><i>This was a dumb idea anyway,\u00a0</i>he thought\nto himself, rooted to the spot as he watched Kira speak to TJ. It all seemed\nuncomfortably familiar, except this time, TJ looked almost&hellip; exasperated. Like\nhe hadn\u2019t counted on Kira being there. He was sat on a swing, looking over at\nthe girl with a slight frown on his face as she spoke.\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus considered just walking away again, bur curiosity got the\nbetter of him and he began to slowly make his way over, as light on his feet as\nhe possibly could be to avoid any loud leaf-crunching. He reached the tree he\nhad watched the pair from last time, feeling slightly guilty about\neavesdropping, but not enough to stop.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you wanna take me to Andi\u2019s party?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus inhaled sharply, heart beginning to race as he watched the\nscene unfold. TJ bowed his head slightly, seemingly unable to meet the girl\u2019s\neye.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI um&hellip;I do! It\u2019s just&hellip;\u201d</p><p>Kira folded her arms, looking scarily as though she\u00a0<i>knew</i>\u00a0what\nTJ was trying to say<i>.</i></p><p>\u201cJust\u00a0<i>what</i>? We\u2019re friends, aren\u2019t we?\nYou like me<i>,\u00a0</i>don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus may have been seeing things, but he swore he saw TJ wince\nat the words. He felt his own face fall at the sight. A light gust of breeze\nrustled the tree leaves above him, and he found himself hurriedly hiding behind\nthe tree trunk as Kira began glancing around.\u00a0</p><p>TJ finally spoke. \u201cI\u00a0<i>do</i>\u00a0like\nyou,\u201d he insisted, \u201cand we\u00a0<i>are</i>\u00a0friends&hellip;I\njust&hellip;\u201d</p><p>Kira let out an impatient huff. \u201cYou just what?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Silence fell for a moment. Cyrus held his breath, shoulders\ntense as he awaited TJ\u2019s response.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI was thinking of taking someone else,\u201d he rushed out,\n\u201c&hellip;potentially.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus peered around the tree trunk to see TJ standing up now,\ntaking a step towards the girl. Kira let out a frustrated sigh, gaze lowering\nto the ground for a moment.</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d she demanded, \u201cand why\u00a0<i>them</i>\u00a0over\u00a0<i>me?</i>\u201d\u00a0</p><p>TJ fell silent. He couldn\u2019t seem to bring himself to answer, and\nKira nodded slowly after a few seconds, clearly expecting the lack of\nresponse.\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus had the brief, hopeful thought that maybe, just\u00a0<i>maybe</i>, the\nperson TJ wanted to take was him. He brushed it away as quickly as it had\nappeared.\u00a0</p><p>Kira let out another sigh, except this time she sounded\u00a0<i>sad</i>\u00a0more\nthan anything. Cyrus found himself frowning. The girl was clearly desperate to\nbe TJ\u2019s first choice, and a part of him understood why. The dull ache that came\nwith feeling unwanted was one he had become familiar with over the past few\nyears, and it wasn\u2019t one he ever enjoyed.\u00a0</p><p>TJ\u2019s hands were fidgeting nervously now as he thought of what to\nsay. He obviously came up blank, because Kira spoke up again.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to say it anyway - I know who it is.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus\u2019 heart skipped a beat. TJ was looking anywhere but Kira\nnow.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Cyrus. Isn\u2019t it?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>He held his breath as he waited for the boy to respond, and\neventually, he gave her a small nod.\u00a0</p><p><i>Holy crap. TJ wanted to go with him.\u00a0</i></p><p>Kira shook her head, laughing bitterly as she took a step back.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really sorry - it\u2019s just - we\u2019re good friends, and I\nthought it\u2019d be a good chance to hang out with him,\u201d TJ explained desperately,\n\u201cwe can go to any other party you want together.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Hurt flashed across Kira\u2019s face, before being replaced with\nsomething else. Something Cyrus could recognise well at this point.\u00a0<i>Anger.\u00a0</i></p><p>\u201cThis whole time, you\u2019ve wanted to be with him. Haven\u2019t\nyou?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNo! I-\u201c</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to lie, TJ. I\u00a0<i>know</i>\u00a0you\nlike him.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus gasped audibly, eyes widened as he hid back behind the\ntree and tried to calm his racing heart down.\u00a0<i>Had\nshe really just said that?</i></p><p>TJ seemed to be getting more and more desperate with each word\nthat left his</p><p>mouth. \u201cAs - as a friend? Yeah, sure! I don\u2019t know why you\u2019d\nimply-\u201c</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen the way you look at him, TJ! You\u00a0<i>like</i>\u00a0him!\nAnd you\u00a0<i>obviously</i>\u00a0prefer him to me! Its the only reason\nyou did the damn costume with me in the first place - you were afraid you\u2019d\nlook-\u201c\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t afraid of anything! Look - Kira - I\u00a0<i>don\u2019t</i>\u00a0prefer\nhim to you, okay? Let\u2019s just drop this. I\u2019ll go to whatever party you wanna go\nto.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>TJ turned around and made his way back over to the swings, but\nhe stopped dead in his tracks when Kira spoke up again. The girl\u2019s anger had\ngiven way to seeming defeat, and Cyrus felt a guilty pang in his chest as he\nwatched on.</p><p>\u201cTJ. Just admit it. You li-\u201c</p><p>The boy whirled back around. \u201cI don\u2019t like him that way,\nokay?!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Silence.\u00a0</p><p>After all these years, Cyrus had always wondered how people in\nbooks could physically feel their\u00a0<i>\u2018heart shatter.\u2019</i>\u00a0Sure,\nhe\u2019d felt sad before, but nothing could\u2019ve prepared him for the blind-siding\nhurt that hit him like a tonne of bricks after hearing those words.\u00a0</p><p>He knew now how it felt to have his heart shatter. Just another\nthing TJ had taught him, he supposed.\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus couldn\u2019t care less about how much noise he was making now,\nhis vision blurred slightly by tears as he turned around and sprinted off in\nthe opposite direction, one thought repeating over and over in his head.\u00a0</p><p><i>He knew it.\u00a0</i></p><p>He knew that TJ was straight.</p><p>He knew that TJ would never like him that way.\u00a0</p><p>He knew that his feelings for cute athletes with sweet smiles\nand nice eyes would never be reciprocated.\u00a0</p><p>So why did the confirmation hurt so much?\u00a0</p><p>Why did it hurt to be made aware of something he\u2019d known all\nalong?\u00a0</p><p>He\u2019d never realised the extent to which he\u2019d unknowingly clung\nonto the illusion that maybe this time it would be different. TJ was\nridiculously nice after all, he never judged him, and he always seemed\ngenuinely excited to hang out.\u00a0</p><p>For a stupid, fleeting moment, he had allowed himself to believe\nthat TJ liked him too. That he laid awake at night thinking about him, that his\nheart raced just as much as Cyrus\u2019 did whenever they hugged.</p><p>But he was just another friend to TJ. And Cyrus had fallen all\nover again, like an idiot, for someone who would never like him back.</p><p>Cyrus thought he could faintly hear someone calling his name in\nthe distance, but his head was spinning at that point and he had no intention\nof slowing down as he reached the edge of the park. Trees were blurring around\nhim, and his legs were already beginning to burn from running, but he didn\u2019t\ndare stop until he was certain that TJ, or anyone else, couldn\u2019t catch up to\nhim.\u00a0</p><p>He collapsed down onto his bed about ten minutes later, finally\nallowing himself to dissolve into tears.\u00a0</p><p>The rainbow bracelet was left discarded on his desk.\u00a0</p><p>~\u00a0</p><p><i>[34 new notifications]\u00a0</i></p><p>Cyrus squinted down at his screen the following morning, eyes\nbleary as he slowly sat up and looked towards the window. Sun was pouring in\nthrough the cracks in his blinds, and he could only assume that all of his\ncrying had somehow managed to knock him out for the night.\u00a0</p><p>He took a moment to compose himself, running a hand through his\nhair. The pain of yesterday hit him all at once as he brought up TJ\u2019s contact,\nletting out a heavy sigh. Scanning over the messages, they seemed to get more\nand more desperate as time passed.\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus bit his lip at the first one.\u00a0</p><p><i>1:23 pm</i></p><p><b>TJ:\u00a0</b>Hey, I\u2019m sorry you overheard my conversation\nwith Kira, I swear I really didn\u2019t invite her\u00a0</p><p><i>1:24pm</i></p><p><b>TJ:\u00a0</b>I wanted to hang out with you\u00a0</p><p><i>2:18 pm\u00a0</i></p><p><b>TJ:\u00a0</b>Call me when you can, okay?\u00a0</p><p><i>4:56pm</i></p><p><b>TJ:\u00a0</b>Okay, I\u2019m getting kind of worried now, are you\nokay?</p><p><i>4:59pm</i></p><p><b>TJ:\u00a0</b>Is this about what Kira said?

Or a comma?\u00a0</p><p><i>6:25pm</i></p><p><b>TJ:\u00a0</b>I\u2019m coming over, okay? Tell me if you don\u2019t\nwant me to\u00a0</p><p><i>6:46pm\u00a0</i></p><p><b>TJ:\u00a0</b>Your mom said you were asleep. Idk if that\u2019s\ntrue, but text me when you can\u00a0</p><p><i>12:13am</i>\u00a0</p><p><b>TJ:</b>\u00a0I\u2019m sorry.\u00a0</p><p><b>TJ:\u00a0</b>I didn\u2019t mean to mess things up between us</p><p><b>TJ:</b>\u00a0I don\u2019t know what to do anymore</p><p>Cyrus could feel his eyes stinging with tears as he put his\nphone down, pausing for a moment to take everything in. TJ thought he was upset\nby Kira\u2019s suggestions in itself, rather than his reaction to it, and Cyrus\nhonestly would\u2019ve preferred that the ground swallow him whole than have to tell\nhim the real season he ran away.\u00a0</p><p>Now that his sadness had given way to a dull feeling inside his\nchest, constantly reminding him of how unwanted he was, Cyrus couldn\u2019t even sum\nup the energy to cry. He just let his head drop back against the pillow and let\nout a heavy sigh.\u00a0</p><p>When his dad knocked gently on his door, asking if he could do\nanything, Cyrus looked towards his desk.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he responded softly, eyes squeezing shut. \u201cCould you\nthrow away that bracelet, please?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>For a moment he looked as though he wanted to say something, but\nhe ended up nodding and moving forward, collecting the bracelet.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSure you\u2019re okay, bud?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus smiled. \u201cI\u2019m fine. Just tired.\u201d</p><p>His dad nodded again, pausing by the doorway for a moment. \u201cI\u2019ll\nbring up some water, okay?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>With that, he was gone for the time being, and Cyrus couldn\u2019t\nseem to keep his eyes off the spot where his \u2018not-so-scary-basketball-guy\u2019\nbracelet for TJ had been.\u00a0</p><p>~</p><p><b>Dad &lt;3:</b>\u00a0<i>Hey Cyrus,\u00a0</i></p><p><i>I\u2019m on my afternoon coffee break and I just thought I\u2019d tell you\nthat I put that bracelet in your bag instead of throwing it away. It seemed\nimportant, but if you really don\u2019t want it, you can get rid of it when you get\nhome.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>Love, Dad</i></p><p>Cyrus stared down at the message for a few long moments,\nswallowing the sudden lump that had appeared in his throat. He was so caught up\nin trying to decipher what his dad had meant by \u2018important,\u2019 that he had missed\nabout half of what Buffy was saying.</p><p>When the girl pointedly cleared her throat he jolted slightly,\nshoving his phone back in his pocket with an apologetic smile.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. What were you saying?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Buffy put her pen down with a sigh. It was Monday now, and the\npair had remained in the library after school to get some homework done. Cyrus\u2019\nmind couldn\u2019t stop wondering though, and whenever he thought about TJ he felt\nthat sad ache begin to swell up in his chest all over again. It was cooler that\nday, probably because of the harsh winds that kept banging doors closed when\nsomeone let air inside. The sky wasn\u2019t cloudless like it had been on Saturday\neither - in fact - Cyrus could barely see any blue looking out of the library\nwindow.</p><p>\u201cForgot about it,\u201d the girl sighed after a moment, \u201cthere are\nmore pressing matters.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus averted his gaze. \u201cLike what?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cLike\u00a0<i>TJ,</i>\u201d said Buffy, straight\nforward as she always was.</p><p>He sighed, knowing well that lying would be a fruitless,\nparticularly when it came to Buffy. That girl could pick up on the slightest of\nexpression changes.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to say about him,\u201d Cyrus shrugged, pretending\nto busy himself with note taking, \u201che doesn\u2019t like me. It\u2019s fine.\u00a0<i>I\u2019m</i>\u00a0fine.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Buffy just scoffed though, turning in her chair to face the boy\nfully. \u201cThat\u2019s just what he was telling Kira - you don\u2019t know for sure.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus found himself shrugging again. \u201cSeemed pretty real to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about all those messages, then?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus felt his face flush at that. Guilt washed over him like an\nice bucket anytime he thought about those texts, and the fact that he never\nresponded to them. He didn\u2019t doubt that TJ was worried about him after all, he\njust doubted his ability to lie right the boy\u2019s face. Or even over text.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHe thinks I was mad because Kira suggested it in the first\nplace,\u201d he explained, leaning back against his chair, \u201cnot because&hellip;\u201d</p><p>Buffy seemed to get the point because her face softened. She\nplaced a hand on his shoulder.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHey - we still don\u2019t know for sure, okay? I think you should\ntalk to him before you come to any conclusions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too late for that, the conclusions have been drawn,\u201d Cyrus\nsighed, a smile ghosting over his lips at the exasperated look Buffy gave him.</p><p>She opened her mouth to respond, but a voice from behind them\ninterrupted her.</p><p>\u201cHey, guys.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus\u2019 eyes widened comically, and he whirled around in his\nchair.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cTJ,\u201d he breathed out.\u00a0</p><p>Buffy was standing up in an instant, collecting up her things\nand giving TJ a pat on the shoulder as he walked past.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll let you two talk.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus sighed again. He had\u00a0<i>not</i>\u00a0counted\nthis in the slightest, but he supposed it would\u2019ve been hard to postpone much\nlonger. They\u00a0<i>did</i>\u00a0go to the same school, after all.</p><p>He glanced up at TJ again when the boy didn\u2019t make to sit down,\neyebrows raised. He looked nervous now, hands shoved in his pockets, and Cyrus\nfelt another pang of guilt.\u00a0</p><p><i>Why weren\u2019t feelings a thing people could just turn off?\u00a0</i></p><p>\u201cDo you think we could take this somewhere more&hellip;you know&hellip;\u201d</p><p>Cyrus smiled slightly. \u201cPrivate? Yeah, I guess so.\u201d</p><p>He paused for a moment to scan the library, and his eyes landed\non a bookshelf row right by the corner that people rarely visited. He packed up\nhis things and left them in a neat pile, gesturing for TJ to follow him.\u00a0</p><p>It was the corner of the library that the least amount of light\nseemed to reach, however, it was still relatively lit by the small window\nsitting high above eye level. Pale light was filtering in due to the overcast\nweather, and it made TJ\u2019s face seem somewhat grey as the boy came to a halt in\nfront of him.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been avoiding me.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t a question, although Cyrus desperately wanted it to\nbe. It was clear that T.J. saw right through what he was doing, so there was no\npoint in denying it. A part of him still wanted to.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he settled on saying, voice soft, \u201cI\u2019ve just\nbeen&hellip;um&hellip;I don\u2019t know. How\u2019d things go with Kira?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>TJ sighed, the hints of an exasperated smile at the corner of\nhis lips. \u201cCyrus - I care about\u00a0<i>you</i>. Let\u2019s\nnot talk about Kira right now, okay?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus swallowed thickly, slightly taken aback by the words. He\ngave a quick nod nonetheless, glancing nervously down at the ground.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m&hellip;I\u2019m sorry for running away. And for not texting you back.\nAnd for avoiding you today. I\u2019ve been trying to get over something, and having\nyou around makes it a bit hard&hellip;\u201d</p><p>TJ\u2019s eyebrows furrowed with confusion. \u201cWhat have you been\ntrying to get over?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus averted his gaze to the ground, his hands fidgeting\nanxiously inside his pockets.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cUm&hellip;\u201d</p><p><i>Well. It\u2019s now or never.\u00a0</i></p><p>\u201cOkay, I have to tell you something. Promise you won\u2019t interrupt\nuntil I\u2019m done?\u201d</p><p>TJ nodded, and Cyrus looked up again, gaze relatively steady\ndespite his nerves.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI um&hellip;I&hellip;\u201d he could already feel himself tearing up slightly,\nfrustratingly enough.</p><p>\u201cWhen I saw you at the park with Kira&hellip;and she um, she said\nthose things-\u201c TJ visibly winced \u201cI&hellip;I got upset, but not just because she\nsaid them.\u201d</p><p>TJ looked confused again now, looking as though he was holding\nhimself back from interrupting. Cyrus continued on, taking his hands out is his\npocket when they began to shake.</p><p>\u201cI was upset because I like you. And - before you say anything -\nit\u2019s okay that you don\u2019t like me back! I can get over it! But&hellip;for a few days,\nit just hurt a lot. I\u2019m really sorry.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>TJ\u2019s face visibly softened at the confession. He took a small\nstep forward. \u201cCyrus, I-\u201c</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t say you\u2019re sorry,\u201d Cyrus pleaded, \u201cit\u2019s not your\nfault, it\u2019s mine.\u201d</p><p>The boy just shook his though, the beginnings of a smile\nappearing on his face. \u201cCyrus,\u201d he paused, stepping right up to the boy and\ntaking both of his hands, \u201cI was lying to Kira. I like you too.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus\u2019 expression was stunned for a few long moments as he took\nthe information in, but as soon as he had an amazed smile formed on his lips.\n\u201cYou do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d TJ smiled, in that soft tone he had reserved\nspecifically for the boy. \u201cYou\u2019re amazing.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus could definitely feel his heart melting now. He looked up\nbashfully and bit his lip, unsure of what to do next.\u00a0</p><p>He was currently\u00a0<i>holding hands</i>\u00a0with\nTJ Kippen, which something he had only ever dared dream about doing.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cCan I um&hellip;can I kiss you?\u201d TJ asked, eyes flitting down to\nCyrus\u2019 lips for a brief moment.</p><p><i>Okay. Someone pinch him.\u00a0</i></p><p>Cyrus could only bring himself to nod, glad that the other boy\nwas initiating something so he didn\u2019t have to. The only kiss he\u2019d had in his\nlife was with Iris, but he knew already that this one would be different. TJ\nnodded, breath slightly shaky as he leaned down. Cyrus stood up on his\ntip-toes, and before he knew it, their lips were connecting for a few moments.\nIt wasn\u2019t long, but at that moment, it was enough for them.\u00a0</p><p>In those few seconds alone, Cyrus could confidently say that\nkissing T.J. was drastically different from kissing Iris. It felt freeing,\nrather than confining, without the ever-present worry in the back of his head,\nnagging him about something be wrong.</p><p>TJ pulled him in for a hug after that and Cyrus happily obliged,\nresting his head against the boy\u2019s chest. He felt a kiss being placed on his\nhead, and<i>dammit, why did he have to blush so easily?</i></p><p>Something hit him then that had a wide smile appearing on his\nlips. \u201cHey - I have something for you in my locker.\u201d</p><p>The words were muffled slightly by TJ\u2019s hoodie, but the boy\nseemed to understand them regardless because he drew back, smiling curiously. \u201cLike\nwhat?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus pulled away fully and gave him a playful shrug. \u201cGuess\nyou\u2019ll just have to come and see.\u201d</p><p>The pair, after collecting Cyrus\u2019 things from the table, left\nthe library and headed towards his locker. There was a \u2018friendly\u2019 distance\nbetween them, although he swore TJ purposely brushed their hands together a few\ntimes.</p><p>After placing his books in his bag, he rummaged around his front\npocket for a moment, letting out a triumphant \u2018aha!\u2019 when he felt the\nbracelet.\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus could feel his face reddening as he pulled it out, turning\naround to offer it to the boy. \u201cI know it\u2019s not much,\u201d he rushed out, \u201cbut Andi\nconvinced me I should make it for you. You obviously don\u2019t have to wear it or\nanyth-\u201c</p><p>\u201cI love it,\u201d TJ interrupted him, smiling brightly. \u201cI\u2019m wearing\nit every day.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus bit his lip, fighting back a smile as he watched the boy\nslip it onto his wrist.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s gay,\u201d said TJ, \u201cjust like me!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>He glanced wearily around the corridor after that, the smile\nreturning to his face when he was certain that no one else was there.\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus grinned and walked forward right into TJ\u2019s arms, giving\nhim another hug.\u00a0</p><p><i>He was so gone.</i></p>",

If he doesn\u2019t, then he has\na\u00a0<i>very</i>\u00a0bad taste in bracelets.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus sighed, leaning back against the confines of the wooden\nchair. He\u2019d spent that Saturday morning at Andi Shack making a bracelet for TJ\nafter some serious convincing from Andi. Truthfully, he was still somewhat\nscarred from the whole shirt fiasco, but the girl had insisted this would be\nmore personal.\u00a0</p><p>Andi turned around again, her smile fading the moment her eyes\nlanded on him. \u201cHey, don\u2019t doubt yourself, okay? He still cares about you, even\nif he\u2019s hanging out with Kira.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus bowed his head. Doubting himself was something he\u2019d become\nparticularly adept at, but somehow, the more he hung out with TJ the less his\nthoughts seemed to take that direction. Lately, he\u2019d been feeling invisible to\nthe boy, and his mind had no problem with reminding him about it endlessly.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think it\u2019s lame?\u201d he asked, voice soft.\u00a0</p><p>A frown appeared on Andi\u2019s face at that. She paused in her\nactions and moved back over to Cyrus, holding out her hands to him. He looked\nup at her with a hesitant smile, taking them and allowing himself to be pulled\nup from his chair.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cCyrus. TJ isn\u2019t like that, okay? He\u2019ll never think you\u2019re lame,\nno matter what. Trust me.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Maybe it was the unwavering way Andi was looking at him, or how\nconfident the words seemed, but Cyrus found himself nodding.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he agreed, smile widening when the girl pulled him in\nfor a tight hug.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d he added in a whisper, and Andi gave him another pat\non the shoulder as they separated.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNo problem. Now - go get your man!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus laughed at that, shaking his head as he made his way over\nto the door.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not my man!\u201d he called over his shoulder as he stepped out\ninto the garden. Andi threw him a disbelieving look and returned to stacking\nher shelves.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cKeep telling yourself that!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus just rolled his eyes. The cool morning had given way to a\nwarm, even\u00a0<i>hot</i>, afternoon. The sky was clear and there was sunlight beaming\ndown on him. He found himself regretting his choice to wear a black shirt, but\nhe pushed the thought aside and concentrated on making his way to the park,<i>without</i>\u00a0somehow\nmanaging to talk himself out of giving TJ the bracelet.</p><p>The walk was a relatively quick one, and by the time he could\nsee the familiar swingset in the distance, he was already beginning to feel\nnervous. His stomach was tying itself into knots, and he came to an abrupt stop\nwhen he spotted TJ there. Alone.\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus took in a deep breath, then another, before squaring his\nshoulders and continuing on his way, approaching the park. The shadows cast\ndown onto him by the trees made the heat somewhat more bearable, and soon\nenough he found himself in almost the exact same position he was before,\nstanding by the park bench near the swings.</p><p>He looked over to the swingset, and when his eyes fell on who\nhad joined TJ his heart sank.\u00a0</p><p><i>This was a dumb idea anyway,\u00a0</i>he thought\nto himself, rooted to the spot as he watched Kira speak to TJ. It all seemed\nuncomfortably familiar, except this time, TJ looked almost\u2026 exasperated. Like\nhe hadn\u2019t counted on Kira being there. He was sat on a swing, looking over at\nthe girl with a slight frown on his face as she spoke.\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus considered just walking away again, bur curiosity got the\nbetter of him and he began to slowly make his way over, as light on his feet as\nhe possibly could be to avoid any loud leaf-crunching. He reached the tree he\nhad watched the pair from last time, feeling slightly guilty about\neavesdropping, but not enough to stop.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you wanna take me to Andi\u2019s party?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus inhaled sharply, heart beginning to race as he watched the\nscene unfold. TJ bowed his head slightly, seemingly unable to meet the girl\u2019s\neye.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI um\u2026I do! It\u2019s just\u2026\u201d</p><p>Kira folded her arms, looking scarily as though she\u00a0<i>knew</i>\u00a0what\nTJ was trying to say<i>.</i></p><p>\u201cJust\u00a0<i>what</i>? We\u2019re friends, aren\u2019t we?\nYou like me<i>,\u00a0</i>don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus may have been seeing things, but he swore he saw TJ wince\nat the words. He felt his own face fall at the sight. A light gust of breeze\nrustled the tree leaves above him, and he found himself hurriedly hiding behind\nthe tree trunk as Kira began glancing around.\u00a0</p><p>TJ finally spoke. \u201cI\u00a0<i>do</i>\u00a0like\nyou,\u201d he insisted, \u201cand we\u00a0<i>are</i>\u00a0friends\u2026I\njust\u2026\u201d</p><p>Kira let out an impatient huff. \u201cYou just what?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Silence fell for a moment. Cyrus held his breath, shoulders\ntense as he awaited TJ\u2019s response.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI was thinking of taking someone else,\u201d he rushed out,\n\u201c\u2026potentially.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus peered around the tree trunk to see TJ standing up now,\ntaking a step towards the girl. Kira let out a frustrated sigh, gaze lowering\nto the ground for a moment.</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d she demanded, \u201cand why\u00a0<i>them</i>\u00a0over\u00a0<i>me?</i>\u201d\u00a0</p><p>TJ fell silent. He couldn\u2019t seem to bring himself to answer, and\nKira nodded slowly after a few seconds, clearly expecting the lack of\nresponse.\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus had the brief, hopeful thought that maybe, just\u00a0<i>maybe</i>, the\nperson TJ wanted to take was him. He brushed it away as quickly as it had\nappeared.\u00a0</p><p>Kira let out another sigh, except this time she sounded\u00a0<i>sad</i>\u00a0more\nthan anything. Cyrus found himself frowning. The girl was clearly desperate to\nbe TJ\u2019s first choice, and a part of him understood why. The dull ache that came\nwith feeling unwanted was one he had become familiar with over the past few\nyears, and it wasn\u2019t one he ever enjoyed.\u00a0</p><p>TJ\u2019s hands were fidgeting nervously now as he thought of what to\nsay. He obviously came up blank, because Kira spoke up again.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to say it anyway - I know who it is.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus\u2019 heart skipped a beat. TJ was looking anywhere but Kira\nnow.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Cyrus. Isn\u2019t it?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>He held his breath as he waited for the boy to respond, and\neventually, he gave her a small nod.\u00a0</p><p><i>Holy crap. TJ wanted to go with him.\u00a0</i></p><p>Kira shook her head, laughing bitterly as she took a step back.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really sorry - it\u2019s just - we\u2019re good friends, and I\nthought it\u2019d be a good chance to hang out with him,\u201d TJ explained desperately,\n\u201cwe can go to any other party you want together.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Hurt flashed across Kira\u2019s face, before being replaced with\nsomething else. Something Cyrus could recognise well at this point.\u00a0<i>Anger.\u00a0</i></p><p>\u201cThis whole time, you\u2019ve wanted to be with him. Haven\u2019t\nyou?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNo! I-\u201c</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to lie, TJ. I\u00a0<i>know</i>\u00a0you\nlike him.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus gasped audibly, eyes widened as he hid back behind the\ntree and tried to calm his racing heart down.\u00a0<i>Had\nshe really just said that?</i></p><p>TJ seemed to be getting more and more desperate with each word\nthat left his</p><p>mouth. \u201cAs - as a friend? Yeah, sure! I don\u2019t know why you\u2019d\nimply-\u201c</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen the way you look at him, TJ! You\u00a0<i>like</i>\u00a0him!\nAnd you\u00a0<i>obviously</i>\u00a0prefer him to me! Its the only reason\nyou did the damn costume with me in the first place - you were afraid you\u2019d\nlook-\u201c\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t afraid of anything! Look - Kira - I\u00a0<i>don\u2019t</i>\u00a0prefer\nhim to you, okay? Let\u2019s just drop this. I\u2019ll go to whatever party you wanna go\nto.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>TJ turned around and made his way back over to the swings, but\nhe stopped dead in his tracks when Kira spoke up again. The girl\u2019s anger had\ngiven way to seeming defeat, and Cyrus felt a guilty pang in his chest as he\nwatched on.</p><p>\u201cTJ. Just admit it. You li-\u201c</p><p>The boy whirled back around. \u201cI don\u2019t like him that way,\nokay?!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Silence.\u00a0</p><p>After all these years, Cyrus had always wondered how people in\nbooks could physically feel their\u00a0<i>\u2018heart shatter.\u2019</i>\u00a0Sure,\nhe\u2019d felt sad before, but nothing could\u2019ve prepared him for the blind-siding\nhurt that hit him like a tonne of bricks after hearing those words.\u00a0</p><p>He knew now how it felt to have his heart shatter. Just another\nthing TJ had taught him, he supposed.\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus couldn\u2019t care less about how much noise he was making now,\nhis vision blurred slightly by tears as he turned around and sprinted off in\nthe opposite direction, one thought repeating over and over in his head.\u00a0</p><p><i>He knew it.\u00a0</i></p><p>He knew that TJ was straight.</p><p>He knew that TJ would never like him that way.\u00a0</p><p>He knew that his feelings for cute athletes with sweet smiles\nand nice eyes would never be reciprocated.\u00a0</p><p>So why did the confirmation hurt so much?\u00a0</p><p>Why did it hurt to be made aware of something he\u2019d known all\nalong?\u00a0</p><p>He\u2019d never realised the extent to which he\u2019d unknowingly clung\nonto the illusion that maybe this time it would be different. TJ was\nridiculously nice after all, he never judged him, and he always seemed\ngenuinely excited to hang out.\u00a0</p><p>For a stupid, fleeting moment, he had allowed himself to believe\nthat TJ liked him too. That he laid awake at night thinking about him, that his\nheart raced just as much as Cyrus\u2019 did whenever they hugged.</p><p>But he was just another friend to TJ. And Cyrus had fallen all\nover again, like an idiot, for someone who would never like him back.</p><p>Cyrus thought he could faintly hear someone calling his name in\nthe distance, but his head was spinning at that point and he had no intention\nof slowing down as he reached the edge of the park. Trees were blurring around\nhim, and his legs were already beginning to burn from running, but he didn\u2019t\ndare stop until he was certain that TJ, or anyone else, couldn\u2019t catch up to\nhim.\u00a0</p><p>He collapsed down onto his bed about ten minutes later, finally\nallowing himself to dissolve into tears.\u00a0</p><p>The rainbow bracelet was left discarded on his desk.\u00a0</p><p>~\u00a0</p><p><i>[34 new notifications]\u00a0</i></p><p>Cyrus squinted down at his screen the following morning, eyes\nbleary as he slowly sat up and looked towards the window. Sun was pouring in\nthrough the cracks in his blinds, and he could only assume that all of his\ncrying had somehow managed to knock him out for the night.\u00a0</p><p>He took a moment to compose himself, running a hand through his\nhair. The pain of yesterday hit him all at once as he brought up TJ\u2019s contact,\nletting out a heavy sigh. Scanning over the messages, they seemed to get more\nand more desperate as time passed.\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus bit his lip at the first one.\u00a0</p><p><i>1:23 pm</i></p><p><b>TJ:\u00a0</b>Hey, I\u2019m sorry you overheard my conversation\nwith Kira, I swear I really didn\u2019t invite her\u00a0</p><p><i>1:24pm</i></p><p><b>TJ:\u00a0</b>I wanted to hang out with you\u00a0</p><p><i>2:18 pm\u00a0</i></p><p><b>TJ:\u00a0</b>Call me when you can, okay?\u00a0</p><p><i>4:56pm</i></p><p><b>TJ:\u00a0</b>Okay, I\u2019m getting kind of worried now, are you\nokay?</p><p><i>4:59pm</i></p><p><b>TJ:\u00a0</b>Is this about what Kira said? I\u2019m sorry, I\nreally don\u2019t know why she was there\u00a0</p><p><i>5:28pm</i></p><p><b>TJ:</b>\u00a0Please just send something so I know you\u2019re okay\u00a0</p><p><b>TJ:</b>\u00a0An emoji maybe? Or a comma?\u00a0</p><p><i>6:25pm</i></p><p><b>TJ:\u00a0</b>I\u2019m coming over, okay? Tell me if you don\u2019t\nwant me to\u00a0</p><p><i>6:46pm\u00a0</i></p><p><b>TJ:\u00a0</b>Your mom said you were asleep. Idk if that\u2019s\ntrue, but text me when you can\u00a0</p><p><i>12:13am</i>\u00a0</p><p><b>TJ:</b>\u00a0I\u2019m sorry.\u00a0</p><p><b>TJ:\u00a0</b>I didn\u2019t mean to mess things up between us</p><p><b>TJ:</b>\u00a0I don\u2019t know what to do anymore</p><p>Cyrus could feel his eyes stinging with tears as he put his\nphone down, pausing for a moment to take everything in. TJ thought he was upset\nby Kira\u2019s suggestions in itself, rather than his reaction to it, and Cyrus\nhonestly would\u2019ve preferred that the ground swallow him whole than have to tell\nhim the real season he ran away.\u00a0</p><p>Now that his sadness had given way to a dull feeling inside his\nchest, constantly reminding him of how unwanted he was, Cyrus couldn\u2019t even sum\nup the energy to cry. He just let his head drop back against the pillow and let\nout a heavy sigh.\u00a0</p><p>When his dad knocked gently on his door, asking if he could do\nanything, Cyrus looked towards his desk.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he responded softly, eyes squeezing shut. \u201cCould you\nthrow away that bracelet, please?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>For a moment he looked as though he wanted to say something, but\nhe ended up nodding and moving forward, collecting the bracelet.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSure you\u2019re okay, bud?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus smiled. \u201cI\u2019m fine. Just tired.\u201d</p><p>His dad nodded again, pausing by the doorway for a moment. \u201cI\u2019ll\nbring up some water, okay?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>With that, he was gone for the time being, and Cyrus couldn\u2019t\nseem to keep his eyes off the spot where his \u2018not-so-scary-basketball-guy\u2019\nbracelet for TJ had been.\u00a0</p><p>~</p><p><b>Dad &lt;3:</b>\u00a0<i>Hey Cyrus,\u00a0</i></p><p><i>I\u2019m on my afternoon coffee break and I just thought I\u2019d tell you\nthat I put that bracelet in your bag instead of throwing it away. It seemed\nimportant, but if you really don\u2019t want it, you can get rid of it when you get\nhome.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>Love, Dad</i></p><p>Cyrus stared down at the message for a few long moments,\nswallowing the sudden lump that had appeared in his throat. He was so caught up\nin trying to decipher what his dad had meant by \u2018important,\u2019 that he had missed\nabout half of what Buffy was saying.</p><p>When the girl pointedly cleared her throat he jolted slightly,\nshoving his phone back in his pocket with an apologetic smile.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. What were you saying?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Buffy put her pen down with a sigh. It was Monday now, and the\npair had remained in the library after school to get some homework done. Cyrus\u2019\nmind couldn\u2019t stop wondering though, and whenever he thought about TJ he felt\nthat sad ache begin to swell up in his chest all over again. It was cooler that\nday, probably because of the harsh winds that kept banging doors closed when\nsomeone let air inside. The sky wasn\u2019t cloudless like it had been on Saturday\neither - in fact - Cyrus could barely see any blue looking out of the library\nwindow.</p><p>\u201cForgot about it,\u201d the girl sighed after a moment, \u201cthere are\nmore pressing matters.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus averted his gaze. \u201cLike what?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cLike\u00a0<i>TJ,</i>\u201d said Buffy, straight\nforward as she always was.</p><p>He sighed, knowing well that lying would be a fruitless,\nparticularly when it came to Buffy. That girl could pick up on the slightest of\nexpression changes.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to say about him,\u201d Cyrus shrugged, pretending\nto busy himself with note taking, \u201che doesn\u2019t like me. It\u2019s fine.\u00a0<i>I\u2019m</i>\u00a0fine.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Buffy just scoffed though, turning in her chair to face the boy\nfully. \u201cThat\u2019s just what he was telling Kira - you don\u2019t know for sure.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus found himself shrugging again. \u201cSeemed pretty real to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about all those messages, then?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus felt his face flush at that. Guilt washed over him like an\nice bucket anytime he thought about those texts, and the fact that he never\nresponded to them. He didn\u2019t doubt that TJ was worried about him after all, he\njust doubted his ability to lie right the boy\u2019s face. Or even over text.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHe thinks I was mad because Kira suggested it in the first\nplace,\u201d he explained, leaning back against his chair, \u201cnot because\u2026\u201d</p><p>Buffy seemed to get the point because her face softened. She\nplaced a hand on his shoulder.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHey - we still don\u2019t know for sure, okay? I think you should\ntalk to him before you come to any conclusions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too late for that, the conclusions have been drawn,\u201d Cyrus\nsighed, a smile ghosting over his lips at the exasperated look Buffy gave him.</p><p>She opened her mouth to respond, but a voice from behind them\ninterrupted her.</p><p>\u201cHey, guys.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus\u2019 eyes widened comically, and he whirled around in his\nchair.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cTJ,\u201d he breathed out.\u00a0</p><p>Buffy was standing up in an instant, collecting up her things\nand giving TJ a pat on the shoulder as he walked past.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll let you two talk.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus sighed again. He had\u00a0<i>not</i>\u00a0counted\nthis in the slightest, but he supposed it would\u2019ve been hard to postpone much\nlonger. They\u00a0<i>did</i>\u00a0go to the same school, after all.</p><p>He glanced up at TJ again when the boy didn\u2019t make to sit down,\neyebrows raised. He looked nervous now, hands shoved in his pockets, and Cyrus\nfelt another pang of guilt.\u00a0</p><p><i>Why weren\u2019t feelings a thing people could just turn off?\u00a0</i></p><p>\u201cDo you think we could take this somewhere more\u2026you know\u2026\u201d</p><p>Cyrus smiled slightly. \u201cPrivate? Yeah, I guess so.\u201d</p><p>He paused for a moment to scan the library, and his eyes landed\non a bookshelf row right by the corner that people rarely visited. He packed up\nhis things and left them in a neat pile, gesturing for TJ to follow him.\u00a0</p><p>It was the corner of the library that the least amount of light\nseemed to reach, however, it was still relatively lit by the small window\nsitting high above eye level. Pale light was filtering in due to the overcast\nweather, and it made TJ\u2019s face seem somewhat grey as the boy came to a halt in\nfront of him.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been avoiding me.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t a question, although Cyrus desperately wanted it to\nbe. It was clear that T.J. saw right through what he was doing, so there was no\npoint in denying it. A part of him still wanted to.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he settled on saying, voice soft, \u201cI\u2019ve just\nbeen\u2026um\u2026I don\u2019t know. How\u2019d things go with Kira?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>TJ sighed, the hints of an exasperated smile at the corner of\nhis lips. \u201cCyrus - I care about\u00a0<i>you</i>. Let\u2019s\nnot talk about Kira right now, okay?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus swallowed thickly, slightly taken aback by the words. He\ngave a quick nod nonetheless, glancing nervously down at the ground.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\u2026I\u2019m sorry for running away. And for not texting you back.\nAnd for avoiding you today. I\u2019ve been trying to get over something, and having\nyou around makes it a bit hard\u2026\u201d</p><p>TJ\u2019s eyebrows furrowed with confusion. \u201cWhat have you been\ntrying to get over?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus averted his gaze to the ground, his hands fidgeting\nanxiously inside his pockets.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cUm\u2026\u201d</p><p><i>Well. It\u2019s now or never.\u00a0</i></p><p>\u201cOkay, I have to tell you something. Promise you won\u2019t interrupt\nuntil I\u2019m done?\u201d</p><p>TJ nodded, and Cyrus looked up again, gaze relatively steady\ndespite his nerves.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI um\u2026I\u2026\u201d he could already feel himself tearing up slightly,\nfrustratingly enough.</p><p>\u201cWhen I saw you at the park with Kira\u2026and she um, she said\nthose things-\u201c TJ visibly winced \u201cI\u2026I got upset, but not just because she\nsaid them.\u201d</p><p>TJ looked confused again now, looking as though he was holding\nhimself back from interrupting. Cyrus continued on, taking his hands out is his\npocket when they began to shake.</p><p>\u201cI was upset because I like you. And - before you say anything -\nit\u2019s okay that you don\u2019t like me back! I can get over it! But\u2026for a few days,\nit just hurt a lot. I\u2019m really sorry.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>TJ\u2019s face visibly softened at the confession. He took a small\nstep forward. \u201cCyrus, I-\u201c</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t say you\u2019re sorry,\u201d Cyrus pleaded, \u201cit\u2019s not your\nfault, it\u2019s mine.\u201d</p><p>The boy just shook his though, the beginnings of a smile\nappearing on his face. \u201cCyrus,\u201d he paused, stepping right up to the boy and\ntaking both of his hands, \u201cI was lying to Kira. I like you too.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus\u2019 expression was stunned for a few long moments as he took\nthe information in, but as soon as he had an amazed smile formed on his lips.\n\u201cYou do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d TJ smiled, in that soft tone he had reserved\nspecifically for the boy. \u201cYou\u2019re amazing.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus could definitely feel his heart melting now. He looked up\nbashfully and bit his lip, unsure of what to do next.\u00a0</p><p>He was currently\u00a0<i>holding hands</i>\u00a0with\nTJ Kippen, which something he had only ever dared dream about doing.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cCan I um\u2026can I kiss you?\u201d TJ asked, eyes flitting down to\nCyrus\u2019 lips for a brief moment.</p><p><i>Okay. Someone pinch him.\u00a0</i></p><p>Cyrus could only bring himself to nod, glad that the other boy\nwas initiating something so he didn\u2019t have to. The only kiss he\u2019d had in his\nlife was with Iris, but he knew already that this one would be different. TJ\nnodded, breath slightly shaky as he leaned down. Cyrus stood up on his\ntip-toes, and before he knew it, their lips were connecting for a few moments.\nIt wasn\u2019t long, but at that moment, it was enough for them.\u00a0</p><p>In those few seconds alone, Cyrus could confidently say that\nkissing T.J. was drastically different from kissing Iris. It felt freeing,\nrather than confining, without the ever-present worry in the back of his head,\nnagging him about something be wrong.</p><p>TJ pulled him in for a hug after that and Cyrus happily obliged,\nresting his head against the boy\u2019s chest. He felt a kiss being placed on his\nhead, and<i>dammit, why did he have to blush so easily?</i></p><p>Something hit him then that had a wide smile appearing on his\nlips. \u201cHey - I have something for you in my locker.\u201d</p><p>The words were muffled slightly by TJ\u2019s hoodie, but the boy\nseemed to understand them regardless because he drew back, smiling curiously. \u201cLike\nwhat?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus pulled away fully and gave him a playful shrug. \u201cGuess\nyou\u2019ll just have to come and see.\u201d</p><p>The pair, after collecting Cyrus\u2019 things from the table, left\nthe library and headed towards his locker. There was a \u2018friendly\u2019 distance\nbetween them, although he swore TJ purposely brushed their hands together a few\ntimes.</p><p>After placing his books in his bag, he rummaged around his front\npocket for a moment, letting out a triumphant \u2018aha!\u2019 when he felt the\nbracelet.\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus could feel his face reddening as he pulled it out, turning\naround to offer it to the boy. \u201cI know it\u2019s not much,\u201d he rushed out, \u201cbut Andi\nconvinced me I should make it for you. You obviously don\u2019t have to wear it or\nanyth-\u201c</p><p>\u201cI love it,\u201d TJ interrupted him, smiling brightly. \u201cI\u2019m wearing\nit every day.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus bit his lip, fighting back a smile as he watched the boy\nslip it onto his wrist.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s gay,\u201d said TJ, \u201cjust like me!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>He glanced wearily around the corridor after that, the smile\nreturning to his face when he was certain that no one else was there.\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus grinned and walked forward right into TJ\u2019s arms, giving\nhim another hug.\u00a0</p><p><i>He was so gone.</i></p>",

If he doesn\u2019t, then he has\na\u00a0<i>very</i>\u00a0bad taste in bracelets.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus sighed, leaning back against the confines of the wooden\nchair. He\u2019d spent that Saturday morning at Andi Shack making a bracelet for TJ\nafter some serious convincing from Andi. Truthfully, he was still somewhat\nscarred from the whole shirt fiasco, but the girl had insisted this would be\nmore personal.\u00a0</p><p>Andi turned around again, her smile fading the moment her eyes\nlanded on him. \u201cHey, don\u2019t doubt yourself, okay? He still cares about you, even\nif he\u2019s hanging out with Kira.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus bowed his head. Doubting himself was something he\u2019d become\nparticularly adept at, but somehow, the more he hung out with TJ the less his\nthoughts seemed to take that direction. Lately, he\u2019d been feeling invisible to\nthe boy, and his mind had no problem with reminding him about it endlessly.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think it\u2019s lame?\u201d he asked, voice soft.\u00a0</p><p>A frown appeared on Andi\u2019s face at that. She paused in her\nactions and moved back over to Cyrus, holding out her hands to him. He looked\nup at her with a hesitant smile, taking them and allowing himself to be pulled\nup from his chair.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cCyrus. TJ isn\u2019t like that, okay? He\u2019ll never think you\u2019re lame,\nno matter what. Trust me.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Maybe it was the unwavering way Andi was looking at him, or how\nconfident the words seemed, but Cyrus found himself nodding.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he agreed, smile widening when the girl pulled him in\nfor a tight hug.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d he added in a whisper, and Andi gave him another pat\non the shoulder as they separated.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNo problem. Now - go get your man!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus laughed at that, shaking his head as he made his way over\nto the door.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not my man!\u201d he called over his shoulder as he stepped out\ninto the garden. Andi threw him a disbelieving look and returned to stacking\nher shelves.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cKeep telling yourself that!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus just rolled his eyes. The cool morning had given way to a\nwarm, even\u00a0<i>hot</i>, afternoon. The sky was clear and there was sunlight beaming\ndown on him. He found himself regretting his choice to wear a black shirt, but\nhe pushed the thought aside and concentrated on making his way to the park,<i>without</i>\u00a0somehow\nmanaging to talk himself out of giving TJ the bracelet.</p><p>The walk was a relatively quick one, and by the time he could\nsee the familiar swingset in the distance, he was already beginning to feel\nnervous. His stomach was tying itself into knots, and he came to an abrupt stop\nwhen he spotted TJ there. Alone.\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus took in a deep breath, then another, before squaring his\nshoulders and continuing on his way, approaching the park. The shadows cast\ndown onto him by the trees made the heat somewhat more bearable, and soon\nenough he found himself in almost the exact same position he was before,\nstanding by the park bench near the swings.</p><p>He looked over to the swingset, and when his eyes fell on who\nhad joined TJ his heart sank.\u00a0</p><p><i>This was a dumb idea anyway,\u00a0</i>he thought\nto himself, rooted to the spot as he watched Kira speak to TJ. It all seemed\nuncomfortably familiar, except this time, TJ looked almost\u2026 exasperated. Like\nhe hadn\u2019t counted on Kira being there. He was sat on a swing, looking over at\nthe girl with a slight frown on his face as she spoke.\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus considered just walking away again, bur curiosity got the\nbetter of him and he began to slowly make his way over, as light on his feet as\nhe possibly could be to avoid any loud leaf-crunching. He reached the tree he\nhad watched the pair from last time, feeling slightly guilty about\neavesdropping, but not enough to stop.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you wanna take me to Andi\u2019s party?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus inhaled sharply, heart beginning to race as he watched the\nscene unfold. TJ bowed his head slightly, seemingly unable to meet the girl\u2019s\neye.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI um\u2026I do! It\u2019s just\u2026\u201d</p><p>Kira folded her arms, looking scarily as though she\u00a0<i>knew</i>\u00a0what\nTJ was trying to say<i>.</i></p><p>\u201cJust\u00a0<i>what</i>? We\u2019re friends, aren\u2019t we?\nYou like me<i>,\u00a0</i>don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus may have been seeing things, but he swore he saw TJ wince\nat the words. He felt his own face fall at the sight. A light gust of breeze\nrustled the tree leaves above him, and he found himself hurriedly hiding behind\nthe tree trunk as Kira began glancing around.\u00a0</p><p>TJ finally spoke. \u201cI\u00a0<i>do</i>\u00a0like\nyou,\u201d he insisted, \u201cand we\u00a0<i>are</i>\u00a0friends\u2026I\njust\u2026\u201d</p><p>Kira let out an impatient huff. \u201cYou just what?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Silence fell for a moment. Cyrus held his breath, shoulders\ntense as he awaited TJ\u2019s response.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI was thinking of taking someone else,\u201d he rushed out,\n\u201c\u2026potentially.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus peered around the tree trunk to see TJ standing up now,\ntaking a step towards the girl. Kira let out a frustrated sigh, gaze lowering\nto the ground for a moment.</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d she demanded, \u201cand why\u00a0<i>them</i>\u00a0over\u00a0<i>me?</i>\u201d\u00a0</p><p>TJ fell silent. He couldn\u2019t seem to bring himself to answer, and\nKira nodded slowly after a few seconds, clearly expecting the lack of\nresponse.\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus had the brief, hopeful thought that maybe, just\u00a0<i>maybe</i>, the\nperson TJ wanted to take was him. He brushed it away as quickly as it had\nappeared.\u00a0</p><p>Kira let out another sigh, except this time she sounded\u00a0<i>sad</i>\u00a0more\nthan anything. Cyrus found himself frowning. The girl was clearly desperate to\nbe TJ\u2019s first choice, and a part of him understood why. The dull ache that came\nwith feeling unwanted was one he had become familiar with over the past few\nyears, and it wasn\u2019t one he ever enjoyed.\u00a0</p><p>TJ\u2019s hands were fidgeting nervously now as he thought of what to\nsay. He obviously came up blank, because Kira spoke up again.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to say it anyway - I know who it is.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus\u2019 heart skipped a beat. TJ was looking anywhere but Kira\nnow.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Cyrus. Isn\u2019t it?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>He held his breath as he waited for the boy to respond, and\neventually, he gave her a small nod.\u00a0</p><p><i>Holy crap. TJ wanted to go with him.\u00a0</i></p><p>Kira shook her head, laughing bitterly as she took a step back.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really sorry - it\u2019s just - we\u2019re good friends, and I\nthought it\u2019d be a good chance to hang out with him,\u201d TJ explained desperately,\n\u201cwe can go to any other party you want together.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Hurt flashed across Kira\u2019s face, before being replaced with\nsomething else. Something Cyrus could recognise well at this point.\u00a0<i>Anger.\u00a0</i></p><p>\u201cThis whole time, you\u2019ve wanted to be with him. Haven\u2019t\nyou?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNo! I-\u201c</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to lie, TJ. I\u00a0<i>know</i>\u00a0you\nlike him.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus gasped audibly, eyes widened as he hid back behind the\ntree and tried to calm his racing heart down.\u00a0<i>Had\nshe really just said that?</i></p><p>TJ seemed to be getting more and more desperate with each word\nthat left his</p><p>mouth. \u201cAs - as a friend? Yeah, sure! I don\u2019t know why you\u2019d\nimply-\u201c</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen the way you look at him, TJ! You\u00a0<i>like</i>\u00a0him!\nAnd you\u00a0<i>obviously</i>\u00a0prefer him to me! Its the only reason\nyou did the damn costume with me in the first place - you were afraid you\u2019d\nlook-\u201c\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t afraid of anything! Look - Kira - I\u00a0<i>don\u2019t</i>\u00a0prefer\nhim to you, okay? Let\u2019s just drop this. I\u2019ll go to whatever party you wanna go\nto.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>TJ turned around and made his way back over to the swings, but\nhe stopped dead in his tracks when Kira spoke up again. The girl\u2019s anger had\ngiven way to seeming defeat, and Cyrus felt a guilty pang in his chest as he\nwatched on.</p><p>\u201cTJ. Just admit it. You li-\u201c</p><p>The boy whirled back around. \u201cI don\u2019t like him that way,\nokay?!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Silence.\u00a0</p><p>After all these years, Cyrus had always wondered how people in\nbooks could physically feel their\u00a0<i>\u2018heart shatter.\u2019</i>\u00a0Sure,\nhe\u2019d felt sad before, but nothing could\u2019ve prepared him for the blind-siding\nhurt that hit him like a tonne of bricks after hearing those words.\u00a0</p><p>He knew now how it felt to have his heart shatter. Just another\nthing TJ had taught him, he supposed.\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus couldn\u2019t care less about how much noise he was making now,\nhis vision blurred slightly by tears as he turned around and sprinted off in\nthe opposite direction, one thought repeating over and over in his head.\u00a0</p><p><i>He knew it.\u00a0</i></p><p>He knew that TJ was straight.</p><p>He knew that TJ would never like him that way.\u00a0</p><p>He knew that his feelings for cute athletes with sweet smiles\nand nice eyes would never be reciprocated.\u00a0</p><p>So why did the confirmation hurt so much?\u00a0</p><p>Why did it hurt to be made aware of something he\u2019d known all\nalong?\u00a0</p><p>He\u2019d never realised the extent to which he\u2019d unknowingly clung\nonto the illusion that maybe this time it would be different. TJ was\nridiculously nice after all, he never judged him, and he always seemed\ngenuinely excited to hang out.\u00a0</p><p>For a stupid, fleeting moment, he had allowed himself to believe\nthat TJ liked him too. That he laid awake at night thinking about him, that his\nheart raced just as much as Cyrus\u2019 did whenever they hugged.</p><p>But he was just another friend to TJ. And Cyrus had fallen all\nover again, like an idiot, for someone who would never like him back.</p><p>Cyrus thought he could faintly hear someone calling his name in\nthe distance, but his head was spinning at that point and he had no intention\nof slowing down as he reached the edge of the park. Trees were blurring around\nhim, and his legs were already beginning to burn from running, but he didn\u2019t\ndare stop until he was certain that TJ, or anyone else, couldn\u2019t catch up to\nhim.\u00a0</p><p>He collapsed down onto his bed about ten minutes later, finally\nallowing himself to dissolve into tears.\u00a0</p><p>The rainbow bracelet was left discarded on his desk.\u00a0</p><p>~\u00a0</p><p><i>[34 new notifications]\u00a0</i></p><p>Cyrus squinted down at his screen the following morning, eyes\nbleary as he slowly sat up and looked towards the window. Sun was pouring in\nthrough the cracks in his blinds, and he could only assume that all of his\ncrying had somehow managed to knock him out for the night.\u00a0</p><p>He took a moment to compose himself, running a hand through his\nhair. The pain of yesterday hit him all at once as he brought up TJ\u2019s contact,\nletting out a heavy sigh. Scanning over the messages, they seemed to get more\nand more desperate as time passed.\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus bit his lip at the first one.\u00a0</p><p><i>1:23 pm</i></p><p><b>TJ:\u00a0</b>Hey, I\u2019m sorry you overheard my conversation\nwith Kira, I swear I really didn\u2019t invite her\u00a0</p><p><i>1:24pm</i></p><p><b>TJ:\u00a0</b>I wanted to hang out with you\u00a0</p><p><i>2:18 pm\u00a0</i></p><p><b>TJ:\u00a0</b>Call me when you can, okay?\u00a0</p><p><i>4:56pm</i></p><p><b>TJ:\u00a0</b>Okay, I\u2019m getting kind of worried now, are you\nokay?</p><p><i>4:59pm</i></p><p><b>TJ:\u00a0</b>Is this about what Kira said?

TJ thought he was upset\nby Kira\u2019s suggestions in itself, rather than his reaction to it, and Cyrus\nhonestly would\u2019ve preferred that the ground swallow him whole than have to tell\nhim the real season he ran away.\u00a0</p><p>Now that his sadness had given way to a dull feeling inside his\nchest, constantly reminding him of how unwanted he was, Cyrus couldn\u2019t even sum\nup the energy to cry. He just let his head drop back against the pillow and let\nout a heavy sigh.\u00a0</p><p>When his dad knocked gently on his door, asking if he could do\nanything, Cyrus looked towards his desk.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he responded softly, eyes squeezing shut. \u201cCould you\nthrow away that bracelet, please?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>For a moment he looked as though he wanted to say something, but\nhe ended up nodding and moving forward, collecting the bracelet.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSure you\u2019re okay, bud?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus smiled. \u201cI\u2019m fine. Just tired.\u201d</p><p>His dad nodded again, pausing by the doorway for a moment. \u201cI\u2019ll\nbring up some water, okay?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>With that, he was gone for the time being, and Cyrus couldn\u2019t\nseem to keep his eyes off the spot where his \u2018not-so-scary-basketball-guy\u2019\nbracelet for TJ had been.\u00a0</p><p>~</p><p><b>Dad &lt;3:</b>\u00a0<i>Hey Cyrus,\u00a0</i></p><p><i>I\u2019m on my afternoon coffee break and I just thought I\u2019d tell you\nthat I put that bracelet in your bag instead of throwing it away. It seemed\nimportant, but if you really don\u2019t want it, you can get rid of it when you get\nhome.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>Love, Dad</i></p><p>Cyrus stared down at the message for a few long moments,\nswallowing the sudden lump that had appeared in his throat. He was so caught up\nin trying to decipher what his dad had meant by \u2018important,\u2019 that he had missed\nabout half of what Buffy was saying.</p><p>When the girl pointedly cleared her throat he jolted slightly,\nshoving his phone back in his pocket with an apologetic smile.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. What were you saying?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Buffy put her pen down with a sigh. It was Monday now, and the\npair had remained in the library after school to get some homework done. Cyrus\u2019\nmind couldn\u2019t stop wondering though, and whenever he thought about TJ he felt\nthat sad ache begin to swell up in his chest all over again. It was cooler that\nday, probably because of the harsh winds that kept banging doors closed when\nsomeone let air inside. The sky wasn\u2019t cloudless like it had been on Saturday\neither - in fact - Cyrus could barely see any blue looking out of the library\nwindow.</p><p>\u201cForgot about it,\u201d the girl sighed after a moment, \u201cthere are\nmore pressing matters.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus averted his gaze. \u201cLike what?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cLike\u00a0<i>TJ,</i>\u201d said Buffy, straight\nforward as she always was.</p><p>He sighed, knowing well that lying would be a fruitless,\nparticularly when it came to Buffy. That girl could pick up on the slightest of\nexpression changes.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to say about him,\u201d Cyrus shrugged, pretending\nto busy himself with note taking, \u201che doesn\u2019t like me. It\u2019s fine.\u00a0<i>I\u2019m</i>\u00a0fine.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Buffy just scoffed though, turning in her chair to face the boy\nfully. \u201cThat\u2019s just what he was telling Kira - you don\u2019t know for sure.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus found himself shrugging again. \u201cSeemed pretty real to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about all those messages, then?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus felt his face flush at that. Guilt washed over him like an\nice bucket anytime he thought about those texts, and the fact that he never\nresponded to them. He didn\u2019t doubt that TJ was worried about him after all, he\njust doubted his ability to lie right the boy\u2019s face. Or even over text.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHe thinks I was mad because Kira suggested it in the first\nplace,\u201d he explained, leaning back against his chair, \u201cnot because\u2026\u201d</p><p>Buffy seemed to get the point because her face softened. She\nplaced a hand on his shoulder.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHey - we still don\u2019t know for sure, okay? I think you should\ntalk to him before you come to any conclusions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too late for that, the conclusions have been drawn,\u201d Cyrus\nsighed, a smile ghosting over his lips at the exasperated look Buffy gave him.</p><p>She opened her mouth to respond, but a voice from behind them\ninterrupted her.</p><p>\u201cHey, guys.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus\u2019 eyes widened comically, and he whirled around in his\nchair.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cTJ,\u201d he breathed out.\u00a0</p><p>Buffy was standing up in an instant, collecting up her things\nand giving TJ a pat on the shoulder as he walked past.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll let you two talk.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus sighed again. He had\u00a0<i>not</i>\u00a0counted\nthis in the slightest, but he supposed it would\u2019ve been hard to postpone much\nlonger. They\u00a0<i>did</i>\u00a0go to the same school, after all.</p><p>He glanced up at TJ again when the boy didn\u2019t make to sit down,\neyebrows raised. He looked nervous now, hands shoved in his pockets, and Cyrus\nfelt another pang of guilt.\u00a0</p><p><i>Why weren\u2019t feelings a thing people could just turn off?\u00a0</i></p><p>\u201cDo you think we could take this somewhere more\u2026you know\u2026\u201d</p><p>Cyrus smiled slightly. \u201cPrivate? Yeah, I guess so.\u201d</p><p>He paused for a moment to scan the library, and his eyes landed\non a bookshelf row right by the corner that people rarely visited. He packed up\nhis things and left them in a neat pile, gesturing for TJ to follow him.\u00a0</p><p>It was the corner of the library that the least amount of light\nseemed to reach, however, it was still relatively lit by the small window\nsitting high above eye level. Pale light was filtering in due to the overcast\nweather, and it made TJ\u2019s face seem somewhat grey as the boy came to a halt in\nfront of him.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been avoiding me.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t a question, although Cyrus desperately wanted it to\nbe. It was clear that T.J. saw right through what he was doing, so there was no\npoint in denying it. A part of him still wanted to.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he settled on saying, voice soft, \u201cI\u2019ve just\nbeen\u2026um\u2026I don\u2019t know. How\u2019d things go with Kira?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>TJ sighed, the hints of an exasperated smile at the corner of\nhis lips. \u201cCyrus - I care about\u00a0<i>you</i>. Let\u2019s\nnot talk about Kira right now, okay?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus swallowed thickly, slightly taken aback by the words. He\ngave a quick nod nonetheless, glancing nervously down at the ground.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\u2026I\u2019m sorry for running away. And for not texting you back.\nAnd for avoiding you today. I\u2019ve been trying to get over something, and having\nyou around makes it a bit hard\u2026\u201d</p><p>TJ\u2019s eyebrows furrowed with confusion. \u201cWhat have you been\ntrying to get over?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus averted his gaze to the ground, his hands fidgeting\nanxiously inside his pockets.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cUm\u2026\u201d</p><p><i>Well. It\u2019s now or never.\u00a0</i></p><p>\u201cOkay, I have to tell you something. Promise you won\u2019t interrupt\nuntil I\u2019m done?\u201d</p><p>TJ nodded, and Cyrus looked up again, gaze relatively steady\ndespite his nerves.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI um\u2026I\u2026\u201d he could already feel himself tearing up slightly,\nfrustratingly enough.</p><p>\u201cWhen I saw you at the park with Kira\u2026and she um, she said\nthose things-\u201c TJ visibly winced \u201cI\u2026I got upset, but not just because she\nsaid them.\u201d</p><p>TJ looked confused again now, looking as though he was holding\nhimself back from interrupting. Cyrus continued on, taking his hands out is his\npocket when they began to shake.</p><p>\u201cI was upset because I like you. And - before you say anything -\nit\u2019s okay that you don\u2019t like me back! I can get over it! But\u2026for a few days,\nit just hurt a lot. I\u2019m really sorry.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>TJ\u2019s face visibly softened at the confession. He took a small\nstep forward. \u201cCyrus, I-\u201c</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t say you\u2019re sorry,\u201d Cyrus pleaded, \u201cit\u2019s not your\nfault, it\u2019s mine.\u201d</p><p>The boy just shook his though, the beginnings of a smile\nappearing on his face. \u201cCyrus,\u201d he paused, stepping right up to the boy and\ntaking both of his hands, \u201cI was lying to Kira. I like you too.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus\u2019 expression was stunned for a few long moments as he took\nthe information in, but as soon as he had an amazed smile formed on his lips.\n\u201cYou do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d TJ smiled, in that soft tone he had reserved\nspecifically for the boy. \u201cYou\u2019re amazing.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus could definitely feel his heart melting now. He looked up\nbashfully and bit his lip, unsure of what to do next.\u00a0</p><p>He was currently\u00a0<i>holding hands</i>\u00a0with\nTJ Kippen, which something he had only ever dared dream about doing.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cCan I um\u2026can I kiss you?\u201d TJ asked, eyes flitting down to\nCyrus\u2019 lips for a brief moment.</p><p><i>Okay. Someone pinch him.\u00a0</i></p><p>Cyrus could only bring himself to nod, glad that the other boy\nwas initiating something so he didn\u2019t have to. The only kiss he\u2019d had in his\nlife was with Iris, but he knew already that this one would be different. TJ\nnodded, breath slightly shaky as he leaned down. Cyrus stood up on his\ntip-toes, and before he knew it, their lips were connecting for a few moments.\nIt wasn\u2019t long, but at that moment, it was enough for them.\u00a0</p><p>In those few seconds alone, Cyrus could confidently say that\nkissing T.J. was drastically different from kissing Iris. It felt freeing,\nrather than confining, without the ever-present worry in the back of his head,\nnagging him about something be wrong.</p><p>TJ pulled him in for a hug after that and Cyrus happily obliged,\nresting his head against the boy\u2019s chest. He felt a kiss being placed on his\nhead, and<i>dammit, why did he have to blush so easily?</i></p><p>Something hit him then that had a wide smile appearing on his\nlips. \u201cHey - I have something for you in my locker.\u201d</p><p>The words were muffled slightly by TJ\u2019s hoodie, but the boy\nseemed to understand them regardless because he drew back, smiling curiously. \u201cLike\nwhat?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus pulled away fully and gave him a playful shrug. \u201cGuess\nyou\u2019ll just have to come and see.\u201d</p><p>The pair, after collecting Cyrus\u2019 things from the table, left\nthe library and headed towards his locker. There was a \u2018friendly\u2019 distance\nbetween them, although he swore TJ purposely brushed their hands together a few\ntimes.</p><p>After placing his books in his bag, he rummaged around his front\npocket for a moment, letting out a triumphant \u2018aha!\u2019 when he felt the\nbracelet.\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus could feel his face reddening as he pulled it out, turning\naround to offer it to the boy. \u201cI know it\u2019s not much,\u201d he rushed out, \u201cbut Andi\nconvinced me I should make it for you. You obviously don\u2019t have to wear it or\nanyth-\u201c</p><p>\u201cI love it,\u201d TJ interrupted him, smiling brightly. \u201cI\u2019m wearing\nit every day.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus bit his lip, fighting back a smile as he watched the boy\nslip it onto his wrist.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s gay,\u201d said TJ, \u201cjust like me!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>He glanced wearily around the corridor after that, the smile\nreturning to his face when he was certain that no one else was there.\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus grinned and walked forward right into TJ\u2019s arms, giving\nhim another hug.\u00a0</p><p><i>He was so gone.</i></p>",

Drama ensues. [post 3x15, mostly canon compliant]\n\n</p><p><b>Word Count:&nbsp;\n\n</b>3849\n\n</p><p><b><i>[AO3 link in the reblog]</i></b></p><p>~</p><p>&ldquo;Are you sure this&rsquo;ll work, Andi?&rdquo;\nasked Cyrus, frowning slightly as his bracelet.</p><p>The girl flashed him a reassuring smile, giving him a pat on a\nshoulder as she walked past and began busying herself with putting away the\nsupplies they&rsquo;d used. &ldquo;TJ will love it, trust me. If he doesn&rsquo;t, then he has\na&nbsp;<i>very</i>&nbsp;bad taste in bracelets.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Cyrus sighed, leaning back against the confines of the wooden\nchair. He&rsquo;d spent that Saturday morning at Andi Shack making a bracelet for TJ\nafter some serious convincing from Andi. Truthfully, he was still somewhat\nscarred from the whole shirt fiasco, but the girl had insisted this would be\nmore personal.&nbsp;</p><p>Andi turned around again, her smile fading the moment her eyes\nlanded on him. &ldquo;Hey, don&rsquo;t doubt yourself, okay? He still cares about you, even\nif he&rsquo;s hanging out with Kira.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Cyrus bowed his head. Doubting himself was something he&rsquo;d become\nparticularly adept at, but somehow, the more he hung out with TJ the less his\nthoughts seemed to take that direction. Lately, he&rsquo;d been feeling invisible to\nthe boy, and his mind had no problem with reminding him about it endlessly.</p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s lame?&rdquo; he asked, voice soft.&nbsp;</p><p>A frown appeared on Andi&rsquo;s face at that. She paused in her\nactions and moved back over to Cyrus, holding out her hands to him. He looked\nup at her with a hesitant smile, taking them and allowing himself to be pulled\nup from his chair.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Cyrus. TJ isn&rsquo;t like that, okay? He&rsquo;ll never think you&rsquo;re lame,\nno matter what. Trust me.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Maybe it was the unwavering way Andi was looking at him, or how\nconfident the words seemed, but Cyrus found himself nodding.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; he agreed, smile widening when the girl pulled him in\nfor a tight hug.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; he added in a whisper, and Andi gave him another pat\non the shoulder as they separated.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;No problem. Now - go get your man!&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Cyrus laughed at that, shaking his head as he made his way over\nto the door.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not my man!&rdquo; he called over his shoulder as he stepped out\ninto the garden. Andi threw him a disbelieving look and returned to stacking\nher shelves.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Keep telling yourself that!&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Cyrus just rolled his eyes. The cool morning had given way to a\nwarm, even&nbsp;<i>hot</i>, afternoon. The sky was clear and there was sunlight beaming\ndown on him. He found himself regretting his choice to wear a black shirt, but\nhe pushed the thought aside and concentrated on making his way to the park,<i>without</i>&nbsp;somehow\nmanaging to talk himself out of giving TJ the bracelet.</p><p>The walk was a relatively quick one, and by the time he could\nsee the familiar swingset in the distance, he was already beginning to feel\nnervous. His stomach was tying itself into knots, and he came to an abrupt stop\nwhen he spotted TJ there. Alone.&nbsp;</p><p>Cyrus took in a deep breath, then another, before squaring his\nshoulders and continuing on his way, approaching the park. The shadows cast\ndown onto him by the trees made the heat somewhat more bearable, and soon\nenough he found himself in almost the exact same position he was before,\nstanding by the park bench near the swings.</p><p>He looked over to the swingset, and when his eyes fell on who\nhad joined TJ his heart sank.&nbsp;</p><p><i>This was a dumb idea anyway,&nbsp;</i>he thought\nto himself, rooted to the spot as he watched Kira speak to TJ. It all seemed\nuncomfortably familiar, except this time, TJ looked almost&hellip; exasperated. Like\nhe hadn&rsquo;t counted on Kira being there. He was sat on a swing, looking over at\nthe girl with a slight frown on his face as she spoke.&nbsp;</p><p>Cyrus considered just walking away again, bur curiosity got the\nbetter of him and he began to slowly make his way over, as light on his feet as\nhe possibly could be to avoid any loud leaf-crunching. He reached the tree he\nhad watched the pair from last time, feeling slightly guilty about\neavesdropping, but not enough to stop.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you wanna take me to Andi&rsquo;s party?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Cyrus inhaled sharply, heart beginning to race as he watched the\nscene unfold. TJ bowed his head slightly, seemingly unable to meet the girl&rsquo;s\neye.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I um&hellip;I do! It&rsquo;s just&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Kira folded her arms, looking scarily as though she&nbsp;<i>knew</i>&nbsp;what\nTJ was trying to say<i>.</i></p><p>&ldquo;Just&nbsp;<i>what</i>? We&rsquo;re friends, aren&rsquo;t we?\nYou like me<i>,&nbsp;</i>don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus may have been seeing things, but he swore he saw TJ wince\nat the words. He felt his own face fall at the sight. A light gust of breeze\nrustled the tree leaves above him, and he found himself hurriedly hiding behind\nthe tree trunk as Kira began glancing around.&nbsp;</p><p>TJ finally spoke. &ldquo;I&nbsp;<i>do</i>&nbsp;like\nyou,&rdquo; he insisted, &ldquo;and we&nbsp;<i>are</i>&nbsp;friends&hellip;I\njust&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Kira let out an impatient huff. &ldquo;You just what?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Silence fell for a moment. Cyrus held his breath, shoulders\ntense as he awaited TJ&rsquo;s response.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I was thinking of taking someone else,&rdquo; he rushed out,\n&ldquo;&hellip;potentially.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Cyrus peered around the tree trunk to see TJ standing up now,\ntaking a step towards the girl. Kira let out a frustrated sigh, gaze lowering\nto the ground for a moment.</p><p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo; she demanded, &ldquo;and why&nbsp;<i>them</i>&nbsp;over&nbsp;<i>me?</i>&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>TJ fell silent. He couldn&rsquo;t seem to bring himself to answer, and\nKira nodded slowly after a few seconds, clearly expecting the lack of\nresponse.&nbsp;</p><p>Cyrus had the brief, hopeful thought that maybe, just&nbsp;<i>maybe</i>, the\nperson TJ wanted to take was him. He brushed it away as quickly as it had\nappeared.&nbsp;</p><p>Kira let out another sigh, except this time she sounded&nbsp;<i>sad</i>&nbsp;more\nthan anything. Cyrus found himself frowning. The girl was clearly desperate to\nbe TJ&rsquo;s first choice, and a part of him understood why. The dull ache that came\nwith feeling unwanted was one he had become familiar with over the past few\nyears, and it wasn&rsquo;t one he ever enjoyed.&nbsp;</p><p>TJ&rsquo;s hands were fidgeting nervously now as he thought of what to\nsay. He obviously came up blank, because Kira spoke up again.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to say it anyway - I know who it is.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Cyrus&rsquo; heart skipped a beat. TJ was looking anywhere but Kira\nnow.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Cyrus. Isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>He held his breath as he waited for the boy to respond, and\neventually, he gave her a small nod.&nbsp;</p><p><i>Holy crap. TJ wanted to go with him.&nbsp;</i></p><p>Kira shook her head, laughing bitterly as she took a step back.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m really sorry - it&rsquo;s just - we&rsquo;re good friends, and I\nthought it&rsquo;d be a good chance to hang out with him,&rdquo; TJ explained desperately,\n&ldquo;we can go to any other party you want together.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Hurt flashed across Kira&rsquo;s face, before being replaced with\nsomething else. Something Cyrus could recognise well at this point.&nbsp;<i>Anger.&nbsp;</i></p><p>&ldquo;This whole time, you&rsquo;ve wanted to be with him. Haven&rsquo;t\nyou?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;No! I-&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to lie, TJ. I&nbsp;<i>know</i>&nbsp;you\nlike him.&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus gasped audibly, eyes widened as he hid back behind the\ntree and tried to calm his racing heart down.&nbsp;<i>Had\nshe really just said that?</i></p><p>TJ seemed to be getting more and more desperate with each word\nthat left his</p><p>mouth. &ldquo;As - as a friend? Yeah, sure! I don&rsquo;t know why you&rsquo;d\nimply-&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen the way you look at him, TJ! You&nbsp;<i>like</i>&nbsp;him!\nAnd you&nbsp;<i>obviously</i>&nbsp;prefer him to me! Its the only reason\nyou did the damn costume with me in the first place - you were afraid you&rsquo;d\nlook-&ldquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t afraid of anything! Look - Kira - I&nbsp;<i>don&rsquo;t</i>&nbsp;prefer\nhim to you, okay? Let&rsquo;s just drop this. I&rsquo;ll go to whatever party you wanna go\nto.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>TJ turned around and made his way back over to the swings, but\nhe stopped dead in his tracks when Kira spoke up again. The girl&rsquo;s anger had\ngiven way to seeming defeat, and Cyrus felt a guilty pang in his chest as he\nwatched on.</p><p>&ldquo;TJ. Just admit it. You li-&ldquo;</p><p>The boy whirled back around. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like him that way,\nokay?!&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Silence.&nbsp;</p><p>After all these years, Cyrus had always wondered how people in\nbooks could physically feel their&nbsp;<i>&lsquo;heart shatter.&rsquo;</i>&nbsp;Sure,\nhe&rsquo;d felt sad before, but nothing could&rsquo;ve prepared him for the blind-siding\nhurt that hit him like a tonne of bricks after hearing those words.&nbsp;</p><p>He knew now how it felt to have his heart shatter. Just another\nthing TJ had taught him, he supposed.&nbsp;</p><p>Cyrus couldn&rsquo;t care less about how much noise he was making now,\nhis vision blurred slightly by tears as he turned around and sprinted off in\nthe opposite direction, one thought repeating over and over in his head.&nbsp;</p><p><i>He knew it.&nbsp;</i></p><p>He knew that TJ was straight.</p><p>He knew that TJ would never like him that way.&nbsp;</p><p>He knew that his feelings for cute athletes with sweet smiles\nand nice eyes would never be reciprocated.&nbsp;</p><p>So why did the confirmation hurt so much?&nbsp;</p><p>Why did it hurt to be made aware of something he&rsquo;d known all\nalong?&nbsp;</p><p>He&rsquo;d never realised the extent to which he&rsquo;d unknowingly clung\nonto the illusion that maybe this time it would be different. TJ was\nridiculously nice after all, he never judged him, and he always seemed\ngenuinely excited to hang out.&nbsp;</p><p>For a stupid, fleeting moment, he had allowed himself to believe\nthat TJ liked him too. That he laid awake at night thinking about him, that his\nheart raced just as much as Cyrus&rsquo; did whenever they hugged.</p><p>But he was just another friend to TJ. And Cyrus had fallen all\nover again, like an idiot, for someone who would never like him back.</p><p>Cyrus thought he could faintly hear someone calling his name in\nthe distance, but his head was spinning at that point and he had no intention\nof slowing down as he reached the edge of the park. Trees were blurring around\nhim, and his legs were already beginning to burn from running, but he didn&rsquo;t\ndare stop until he was certain that TJ, or anyone else, couldn&rsquo;t catch up to\nhim.&nbsp;</p><p>He collapsed down onto his bed about ten minutes later, finally\nallowing himself to dissolve into tears.&nbsp;</p><p>The rainbow bracelet was left discarded on his desk.&nbsp;</p><p>~&nbsp;</p><p><i>[34 new notifications]&nbsp;</i></p><p>Cyrus squinted down at his screen the following morning, eyes\nbleary as he slowly sat up and looked towards the window. Sun was pouring in\nthrough the cracks in his blinds, and he could only assume that all of his\ncrying had somehow managed to knock him out for the night.&nbsp;</p><p>He took a moment to compose himself, running a hand through his\nhair. The pain of yesterday hit him all at once as he brought up TJ&rsquo;s contact,\nletting out a heavy sigh. Scanning over the messages, they seemed to get more\nand more desperate as time passed.&nbsp;</p><p>Cyrus bit his lip at the first one.&nbsp;</p><p><i>1:23 pm</i></p><p><b>TJ:&nbsp;</b>Hey, I&rsquo;m sorry you overheard my conversation\nwith Kira, I swear I really didn&rsquo;t invite her&nbsp;</p><p><i>1:24pm</i></p><p><b>TJ:&nbsp;</b>I wanted to hang out with you&nbsp;</p><p><i>2:18 pm&nbsp;</i></p><p><b>TJ:&nbsp;</b>Call me when you can, okay?&nbsp;</p><p><i>4:56pm</i></p><p><b>TJ:&nbsp;</b>Okay, I&rsquo;m getting kind of worried now, are you\nokay?</p><p><i>4:59pm</i></p><p><b>TJ:&nbsp;</b>Is this about what Kira said?

Or a comma?&nbsp;</p><p><i>6:25pm</i></p><p><b>TJ:&nbsp;</b>I&rsquo;m coming over, okay? Tell me if you don&rsquo;t\nwant me to&nbsp;</p><p><i>6:46pm&nbsp;</i></p><p><b>TJ:&nbsp;</b>Your mom said you were asleep.

TJ thought he was upset\nby Kira&rsquo;s suggestions in itself, rather than his reaction to it, and Cyrus\nhonestly would&rsquo;ve preferred that the ground swallow him whole than have to tell\nhim the real season he ran away.&nbsp;</p><p>Now that his sadness had given way to a dull feeling inside his\nchest, constantly reminding him of how unwanted he was, Cyrus couldn&rsquo;t even sum\nup the energy to cry. He just let his head drop back against the pillow and let\nout a heavy sigh.&nbsp;</p><p>When his dad knocked gently on his door, asking if he could do\nanything, Cyrus looked towards his desk.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; he responded softly, eyes squeezing shut. &ldquo;Could you\nthrow away that bracelet, please?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>For a moment he looked as though he wanted to say something, but\nhe ended up nodding and moving forward, collecting the bracelet.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Sure you&rsquo;re okay, bud?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Cyrus smiled. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine. Just tired.&rdquo;</p><p>His dad nodded again, pausing by the doorway for a moment. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll\nbring up some water, okay?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>With that, he was gone for the time being, and Cyrus couldn&rsquo;t\nseem to keep his eyes off the spot where his &lsquo;not-so-scary-basketball-guy&rsquo;\nbracelet for TJ had been.&nbsp;</p><p>~</p><p><b>Dad &lt;3:</b>&nbsp;<i>Hey Cyrus,&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>I&rsquo;m on my afternoon coffee break and I just thought I&rsquo;d tell you\nthat I put that bracelet in your bag instead of throwing it away. It seemed\nimportant, but if you really don&rsquo;t want it, you can get rid of it when you get\nhome.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>Love, Dad</i></p><p>Cyrus stared down at the message for a few long moments,\nswallowing the sudden lump that had appeared in his throat. He was so caught up\nin trying to decipher what his dad had meant by &lsquo;important,&rsquo; that he had missed\nabout half of what Buffy was saying.</p><p>When the girl pointedly cleared her throat he jolted slightly,\nshoving his phone back in his pocket with an apologetic smile.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry. What were you saying?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Buffy put her pen down with a sigh. It was Monday now, and the\npair had remained in the library after school to get some homework done. Cyrus&rsquo;\nmind couldn&rsquo;t stop wondering though, and whenever he thought about TJ he felt\nthat sad ache begin to swell up in his chest all over again. It was cooler that\nday, probably because of the harsh winds that kept banging doors closed when\nsomeone let air inside. The sky wasn&rsquo;t cloudless like it had been on Saturday\neither - in fact - Cyrus could barely see any blue looking out of the library\nwindow.</p><p>&ldquo;Forgot about it,&rdquo; the girl sighed after a moment, &ldquo;there are\nmore pressing matters.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Cyrus averted his gaze. &ldquo;Like what?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Like&nbsp;<i>TJ,</i>&rdquo; said Buffy, straight\nforward as she always was.</p><p>He sighed, knowing well that lying would be a fruitless,\nparticularly when it came to Buffy. That girl could pick up on the slightest of\nexpression changes.</p><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing to say about him,&rdquo; Cyrus shrugged, pretending\nto busy himself with note taking, &ldquo;he doesn&rsquo;t like me. It&rsquo;s fine.&nbsp;<i>I&rsquo;m</i>&nbsp;fine.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Buffy just scoffed though, turning in her chair to face the boy\nfully. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s just what he was telling Kira - you don&rsquo;t know for sure.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Cyrus found himself shrugging again. &ldquo;Seemed pretty real to me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What about all those messages, then?&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus felt his face flush at that. Guilt washed over him like an\nice bucket anytime he thought about those texts, and the fact that he never\nresponded to them. He didn&rsquo;t doubt that TJ was worried about him after all, he\njust doubted his ability to lie right the boy&rsquo;s face. Or even over text.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;He thinks I was mad because Kira suggested it in the first\nplace,&rdquo; he explained, leaning back against his chair, &ldquo;not because&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Buffy seemed to get the point because her face softened. She\nplaced a hand on his shoulder.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Hey - we still don&rsquo;t know for sure, okay? I think you should\ntalk to him before you come to any conclusions.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too late for that, the conclusions have been drawn,&rdquo; Cyrus\nsighed, a smile ghosting over his lips at the exasperated look Buffy gave him.</p><p>She opened her mouth to respond, but a voice from behind them\ninterrupted her.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, guys.&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus&rsquo; eyes widened comically, and he whirled around in his\nchair.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;TJ,&rdquo; he breathed out.&nbsp;</p><p>Buffy was standing up in an instant, collecting up her things\nand giving TJ a pat on the shoulder as he walked past.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll let you two talk.&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus sighed again. He had&nbsp;<i>not</i>&nbsp;counted\nthis in the slightest, but he supposed it would&rsquo;ve been hard to postpone much\nlonger. They&nbsp;<i>did</i>&nbsp;go to the same school, after all.</p><p>He glanced up at TJ again when the boy didn&rsquo;t make to sit down,\neyebrows raised. He looked nervous now, hands shoved in his pockets, and Cyrus\nfelt another pang of guilt.&nbsp;</p><p><i>Why weren&rsquo;t feelings a thing people could just turn off?&nbsp;</i></p><p>&ldquo;Do you think we could take this somewhere more&hellip;you know&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus smiled slightly. &ldquo;Private? Yeah, I guess so.&rdquo;</p><p>He paused for a moment to scan the library, and his eyes landed\non a bookshelf row right by the corner that people rarely visited. He packed up\nhis things and left them in a neat pile, gesturing for TJ to follow him.&nbsp;</p><p>It was the corner of the library that the least amount of light\nseemed to reach, however, it was still relatively lit by the small window\nsitting high above eye level. Pale light was filtering in due to the overcast\nweather, and it made TJ&rsquo;s face seem somewhat grey as the boy came to a halt in\nfront of him.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been avoiding me.&rdquo;</p><p>It wasn&rsquo;t a question, although Cyrus desperately wanted it to\nbe. It was clear that T.J. saw right through what he was doing, so there was no\npoint in denying it. A part of him still wanted to.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; he settled on saying, voice soft, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just\nbeen&hellip;um&hellip;I don&rsquo;t know. How&rsquo;d things go with Kira?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>TJ sighed, the hints of an exasperated smile at the corner of\nhis lips. &ldquo;Cyrus - I care about&nbsp;<i>you</i>. Let&rsquo;s\nnot talk about Kira right now, okay?&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus swallowed thickly, slightly taken aback by the words. He\ngave a quick nod nonetheless, glancing nervously down at the ground.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m&hellip;I&rsquo;m sorry for running away. And for not texting you back.\nAnd for avoiding you today. I&rsquo;ve been trying to get over something, and having\nyou around makes it a bit hard&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>TJ&rsquo;s eyebrows furrowed with confusion. &ldquo;What have you been\ntrying to get over?&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus averted his gaze to the ground, his hands fidgeting\nanxiously inside his pockets.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Um&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p><i>Well. It&rsquo;s now or never.&nbsp;</i></p><p>&ldquo;Okay, I have to tell you something. Promise you won&rsquo;t interrupt\nuntil I&rsquo;m done?&rdquo;</p><p>TJ nodded, and Cyrus looked up again, gaze relatively steady\ndespite his nerves.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I um&hellip;I&hellip;&rdquo; he could already feel himself tearing up slightly,\nfrustratingly enough.</p><p>&ldquo;When I saw you at the park with Kira&hellip;and she um, she said\nthose things-&ldquo; TJ visibly winced &ldquo;I&hellip;I got upset, but not just because she\nsaid them.&rdquo;</p><p>TJ looked confused again now, looking as though he was holding\nhimself back from interrupting. Cyrus continued on, taking his hands out is his\npocket when they began to shake.</p><p>&ldquo;I was upset because I like you. And - before you say anything -\nit&rsquo;s okay that you don&rsquo;t like me back! I can get over it! But&hellip;for a few days,\nit just hurt a lot. I&rsquo;m really sorry.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>TJ&rsquo;s face visibly softened at the confession. He took a small\nstep forward. &ldquo;Cyrus, I-&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t say you&rsquo;re sorry,&rdquo; Cyrus pleaded, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not your\nfault, it&rsquo;s mine.&rdquo;</p><p>The boy just shook his though, the beginnings of a smile\nappearing on his face. &ldquo;Cyrus,&rdquo; he paused, stepping right up to the boy and\ntaking both of his hands, &ldquo;I was lying to Kira. I like you too.&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus&rsquo; expression was stunned for a few long moments as he took\nthe information in, but as soon as he had an amazed smile formed on his lips.\n&ldquo;You do?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; TJ smiled, in that soft tone he had reserved\nspecifically for the boy. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re amazing.&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus could definitely feel his heart melting now. He looked up\nbashfully and bit his lip, unsure of what to do next.&nbsp;</p><p>He was currently&nbsp;<i>holding hands</i>&nbsp;with\nTJ Kippen, which something he had only ever dared dream about doing.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Can I um&hellip;can I kiss you?&rdquo; TJ asked, eyes flitting down to\nCyrus&rsquo; lips for a brief moment.</p><p><i>Okay. Someone pinch him.&nbsp;</i></p><p>Cyrus could only bring himself to nod, glad that the other boy\nwas initiating something so he didn&rsquo;t have to. The only kiss he&rsquo;d had in his\nlife was with Iris, but he knew already that this one would be different. TJ\nnodded, breath slightly shaky as he leaned down. Cyrus stood up on his\ntip-toes, and before he knew it, their lips were connecting for a few moments.\nIt wasn&rsquo;t long, but at that moment, it was enough for them.&nbsp;</p><p>In those few seconds alone, Cyrus could confidently say that\nkissing T.J. was drastically different from kissing Iris. It felt freeing,\nrather than confining, without the ever-present worry in the back of his head,\nnagging him about something be wrong.</p><p>TJ pulled him in for a hug after that and Cyrus happily obliged,\nresting his head against the boy&rsquo;s chest. He felt a kiss being placed on his\nhead, and<i>dammit, why did he have to blush so easily?</i></p><p>Something hit him then that had a wide smile appearing on his\nlips. &ldquo;Hey - I have something for you in my locker.&rdquo;</p><p>The words were muffled slightly by TJ&rsquo;s hoodie, but the boy\nseemed to understand them regardless because he drew back, smiling curiously. &ldquo;Like\nwhat?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Cyrus pulled away fully and gave him a playful shrug. &ldquo;Guess\nyou&rsquo;ll just have to come and see.&rdquo;</p><p>The pair, after collecting Cyrus&rsquo; things from the table, left\nthe library and headed towards his locker. There was a &lsquo;friendly&rsquo; distance\nbetween them, although he swore TJ purposely brushed their hands together a few\ntimes.</p><p>After placing his books in his bag, he rummaged around his front\npocket for a moment, letting out a triumphant &lsquo;aha!&rsquo; when he felt the\nbracelet.&nbsp;</p><p>Cyrus could feel his face reddening as he pulled it out, turning\naround to offer it to the boy. &ldquo;I know it&rsquo;s not much,&rdquo; he rushed out, &ldquo;but Andi\nconvinced me I should make it for you. You obviously don&rsquo;t have to wear it or\nanyth-&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I love it,&rdquo; TJ interrupted him, smiling brightly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m wearing\nit every day.&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus bit his lip, fighting back a smile as he watched the boy\nslip it onto his wrist.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s gay,&rdquo; said TJ, &ldquo;just like me!&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>He glanced wearily around the corridor after that, the smile\nreturning to his face when he was certain that no one else was there.&nbsp;</p><p>Cyrus grinned and walked forward right into TJ&rsquo;s arms, giving\nhim another hug.&nbsp;</p><p><i>He was so gone.</i></p>",
