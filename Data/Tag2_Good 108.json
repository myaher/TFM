Sometimes they met in Birmingham, sometimes in London where Tommy had business with Mr. Solomons (another odd man Crowley had the not-pleasure to meet.) Sometimes he visited Tommy at his house or in Watery Lane, therefore \u00a0he had the chance to meet the Shelby family.</p><p>They were friends, somehow, and this was something new to both of them. Crowley have always had nothing but Aziraphale and their weird, century-old friendship (because it wasn&rsquo;t just an alliance anymore); Tommy had his noisy extended family, but he couldn&rsquo;t really say he had a friend since Freddie Thorne, and things got complicated after the war.</p><p>During their evenings they drank, smoked and talked, a lot. Sometimes alone, sometimes with Ada or Polly and, after a while, Crowley found himself quite enjoying their company as well. He liked discussing communist principles with Ada (something the world thought coming straight from hell) and talking about religion and occultism with Polly. They were sharp and clever, obviously the force holding the family and the business together. He couldn&rsquo;t understand why men were so convinced of their gender supremacy. Really.</p><p>And then, there were his brothers.</p><p>In Crowley\u2019s eyes, the Shelby siblings were basically a heap of angst, rage and cheekbones. Nevertheless, he could understand why ordinary people were so respectful towards them. Arthur a crazy horse, wrecked to the core but still trying to pull his shit together; John didn\u2019t seem to know what to do half of the time (but fortunately he had Esme, helping him the other half); Finn was just a kid trying to act like his elder brothers.</p><p>Last but not least Michael, their cousin: secure and restrained on the outside, scared and full of doubts on the inside. <i>A bit like Tommy</i>, Crowley thought after talking to him for a while.</p><p>With the right amount of alcool in their blood, they shared many bits of their private lives: Tommy talked about Grace and Charlie, about the war and his nightmares, and Crowley rambled too many things about himself and, sometimes, about Aziraphale. He vaguely remembers mentioning the fact that he had met Byron in person, and that he was a pompous haughty arse.</p><p>But they had some kind of agreement on not talking about work and business.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a matter of trust,\u201d Tommy explained once, &quot;it&rsquo;s just tha&ndash; I prefer leaving all that stuff at the office, whenever I can.\u201d</p><p>And they never discussed about Crowley always wearing sunglasses and the yellow eyes Tommy was sure they were covering. <i>A trick of lights</i>, the man said to himself, <i>or some kind of disease</i>. Or maybe he just preferred ignorance for once in his life.</p><p>***</p><p>Months passed, with more meetings and dinners, but Crowley and Aziraphale never talked about this Tommy-thing properly. After all the time they\u2019ve known each other, it was nice to still have a secret just for himself. And besides, although Crowley would never admit it, he was a bit nervous about the angel\u2019s opinion on the matter.</p><p>He mentioned Tommy once or twice during their conversations, elegantly avoiding every subtle question and curious glance, until Aziraphale decided to bring all this secrecy to an end.</p><p>The topic casually popped out during one of their long strolls in St. James, while they were planning one of their usual dinners.</p><p>\u201cOh, not Friday, sorry. Going to Birmingham.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgain? Really?\u201d Aziraphale asked, his voice high pitched.</p><p>\u201cWhat, are you jealous?\u201d Crowley sniped back with a smirk on his face.</p><p>\u201cOf course not!\u201d <i>Liar</i>, the demon thought. The angel frowned, recollecting his thoughts while feeding the ducks.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just\u2014 I\u2019m a bit surprised. I know you enjoy some human things but, you\u2019ve never shown affection to humankind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a demon, I think it\u2019s normal,\u201d he shrugged, trying to hide himself behind his glasses.</p><p>Aziraphale chuckled, the sound of small bells coming from his mouth. \u201cPlease, dear, we both know you are not\u2026 conventional. And don\u2019t get me wrong, it\u2019s a good thing. This Thomas, he must be something if you\u2019re so fond of him.\u201d He threw the last piece of bread into the pond and they started walking again, side by side.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think <i>fondness</i> is the right word. He needed help, I did my black magic thing. End of the story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re a very diligent demon, of course,\u201d the angel said wryly and Crowley rolled his eyes.</p><p>\u201cFine. I helped him because \u2014 I don\u2019t even know. But his voice was so clear, his pain so real that I couldn\u2019t help following it,\u201d he finally admitted.</p><p>Then Aziraphale did something Crowley didn\u2019t expect, at all. He put his hand on the demon\u2019s arm, squeezing slightly. Physical contact was a line they crossed only for special occasion. Crowley looked at him with wide eyes and the angel withdrew his hand immediately, blushing under all the tiny freckles on his cheeks.</p><p>Aziraphale sighed. \u201cYou did something nice, it must have felt good. I can\u2019t even remember the last time I interacted with a human being like this. <i>Just small things to help them, our duty is to keep balance</i>, they said.</p><p>He looked really sad and Crowley hated it with all of his heart. Melancholy didn\u2019t look good on \u00a0that pretty face. Maybe this could sound like a stereotype, but Aziraphale have always been the one good at comforting. Crowley didn\u2019t know what to do in this kind of situation, but he would definitely make an attempt to swipe that gloomy expression away.</p><p><i>Stupid Archangels who give stupid orders</i>.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got plenty of time to fix that. What I\u2019ve done, it was anything special. Just answer a call or two, there are so many humans that need a guardian angel\u201d, and he gave him what was supposed to be a warm and reassuring smile (like Aziraphale would do), but that probably looked more like a crooked grin. But the angel deeply appreciated it anyway.</p><p>\u201cUnless you are so scrupulous you want to stick to Heaven\u2019s rules,\u201d Crowley said amused, finally managing to get a small smile out of Aziraphale.</p><p>\u201cOh and, by the way, I\u2019m not sure you\u2019d define helping Tommy as the right choice,\u201d he added. \u201cHe\u2019s kind of a gangster, who knows what kind of dangerous shady business he\u2014,\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?!\u201d Aziraphale looked at him in disbelief, \u201cYou mean, the first time you take an interest in mankind ever, it is because of a dejected gangster?!\u201d and his voice high pitched again.</p><p><i>Aw</i>, Crowley thought, <i>that\u2019s my finicky boy</i>.</p><p>\u201cAre you surprised? Really? I\u2019m not a saint and I don\u2019t do charity. I like humans with a moral sense as twisted as mine,\u201d he sneered.</p><p>Crowley walked away, leaving Aziraphale behind. He didn\u2019t need to see his face to know it was red with disapproval and indignation.</p><p>\u201cOh, Crowley, I can\u2019t believe it! Yo\u2014 you\u2019re\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFabulous? I know, Angel. And please don\u2019t judge him from his job. Now, you have centuries of helping old ladies with their bags to catch up with. Chop chop!\u201d</p><p>***</p><p>But all the good things in life come to an end, like a bottle of fine whiskey. This thought strikes Crowley\u2019s mind every time, even though he should have learnt the lesson by now. </p><p>The day Tommy died, he got a call from Ada. He could hear the light tremble in her voice.</p><p>\u201cI thought you might like to know,\u201d she just said. He got all the details about the funeral and hung up the phone.</p><p>He knew that day would come since the beginning. Tommy was just a man, after all. No matter how long his life would last, it wouldn\u2019t have been enough.</p><p> Crowley kept himself busy for the couple of days before the funeral. He had to make calls, meet people and ask for favors. He also asked Aziraphale for help, hushing him before he could start rambling about feelings and grief, forcing a cup of tea in his cold hands.</p><p>The price was high but, in the end, he had what he wanted.</p><p><i>It\u2019s a nice place for a funeral</i>, Crowley thought stepping out his car. He gazed at the thin line where the green fields met the sky. A small group of people, all dressed in black, was gathering slowly around a wooden cart. \u00a0He stayed away from them, watching Tommy\u2019s family crying and giving their farewell. Only Ada spotted him; she waved at him sheepishly, grabbing Karl\u2019s shoulder with the other hand.</p><p>Tommy was watching them too, sitting on a fallen trunk beside the cart. His face was calm as usual, not even blinking when he noticed Crowley staring right at him.</p><p>\u201cYou dont\u2019 look surprised to see me,\u201d the demon said mildly amused, and sat next to him.</p><p>\u201cI suppose not,\u201d Tommy answered like it was the most natural thing in the world.</p><p><i>Always the most unpredictable</i>, and for the first time he didn\u2019t avoid thinking about how much he\u2019d have missed him.</p><p>Tommy asked for a last cigarette together and Crowley made them appear. They just stayed there, smoking in silence. At some point, Crowley took his sunglasses off, finally giving his friend a full sight of his yellow snaky eyes. Tommy huffed a smile.</p><p>\u201cThey look\u2026 appropriate on you,\u201d and the demon couldn\u2019t help laughing.</p><p>But then the man sighed heavily. \u201cDo I need to leave immediately? And will\u2014 will you take me <i>there</i>?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will, but there\u2019s no hurry. We can go whenever you\u2019re ready\u201d</p><p>Tommy nodded in acknowledgment.</p><p>They sat there for a while longer, watching the cart burning slowly. He inhaled the last breath of his cigarette and stood up, giving a last glance at his family.</p><p>\u201cKeep an eye on them, on Charlie, would you?\u201d</p><p>Of course he wasn\u2019t the right creature for something like that, but he decided to indulge his friend\u2019s last wish.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll try,\u201d and he put his pale hand on Tommy\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>They looked at each other, a tiny smile on their faces, and then they vanished into thin air.</p><p>***</p><p>Many years later, Crowley was hurrying across the streets of London when he stumbled across a small handmade hat shop. Between sharp top hats and bowlers, he noticed a grey flat cap in the right corner of the shop window. The demon crossed the door wearing his most amiable smile, bought the hat and left in a few minutes.</p><p>He kept it in a small box at the top of his closet and, sometimes, he wore it just to remember.</p><p>(And Aziraphale never stopped joking tenderly about it.)</p>",

Sometimes they met in Birmingham, sometimes in London where Tommy had business with Mr. Solomons (another odd man Crowley had the not-pleasure to meet.) Sometimes he visited Tommy at his house or in Watery Lane, therefore \u00a0he had the chance to meet the Shelby family.</p><p>They were friends, somehow, and this was something new to both of them. Crowley have always had nothing but Aziraphale and their weird, century-old friendship (because it wasn\u2019t just an alliance anymore); Tommy had his noisy extended family, but he couldn\u2019t really say he had a friend since Freddie Thorne, and things got complicated after the war.</p><p>During their evenings they drank, smoked and talked, a lot. Sometimes alone, sometimes with Ada or Polly and, after a while, Crowley found himself quite enjoying their company as well. He liked discussing communist principles with Ada (something the world thought coming straight from hell) and talking about religion and occultism with Polly. They were sharp and clever, obviously the force holding the family and the business together. He couldn\u2019t understand why men were so convinced of their gender supremacy. Really.</p><p>And then, there were his brothers.</p><p>In Crowley\u2019s eyes, the Shelby siblings were basically a heap of angst, rage and cheekbones. Nevertheless, he could understand why ordinary people were so respectful towards them. Arthur a crazy horse, wrecked to the core but still trying to pull his shit together; John didn\u2019t seem to know what to do half of the time (but fortunately he had Esme, helping him the other half); Finn was just a kid trying to act like his elder brothers.</p><p>Last but not least Michael, their cousin: secure and restrained on the outside, scared and full of doubts on the inside. <i>A bit like Tommy</i>, Crowley thought after talking to him for a while.</p><p>With the right amount of alcool in their blood, they shared many bits of their private lives: Tommy talked about Grace and Charlie, about the war and his nightmares, and Crowley rambled too many things about himself and, sometimes, about Aziraphale. He vaguely remembers mentioning the fact that he had met Byron in person, and that he was a pompous haughty arse.</p><p>But they had some kind of agreement on not talking about work and business.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a matter of trust,\u201d Tommy explained once, \"it\u2019s just tha\u2013 I prefer leaving all that stuff at the office, whenever I can.\u201d</p><p>And they never discussed about Crowley always wearing sunglasses and the yellow eyes Tommy was sure they were covering. <i>A trick of lights</i>, the man said to himself, <i>or some kind of disease</i>. Or maybe he just preferred ignorance for once in his life.</p><p>***</p><p>Months passed, with more meetings and dinners, but Crowley and Aziraphale never talked about this Tommy-thing properly. After all the time they\u2019ve known each other, it was nice to still have a secret just for himself. And besides, although Crowley would never admit it, he was a bit nervous about the angel\u2019s opinion on the matter.</p><p>He mentioned Tommy once or twice during their conversations, elegantly avoiding every subtle question and curious glance, until Aziraphale decided to bring all this secrecy to an end.</p><p>The topic casually popped out during one of their long strolls in St. James, while they were planning one of their usual dinners.</p><p>\u201cOh, not Friday, sorry. Going to Birmingham.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgain? Really?\u201d Aziraphale asked, his voice high pitched.</p><p>\u201cWhat, are you jealous?\u201d Crowley sniped back with a smirk on his face.</p><p>\u201cOf course not!\u201d <i>Liar</i>, the demon thought. The angel frowned, recollecting his thoughts while feeding the ducks.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just\u2014 I\u2019m a bit surprised. I know you enjoy some human things but, you\u2019ve never shown affection to humankind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a demon, I think it\u2019s normal,\u201d he shrugged, trying to hide himself behind his glasses.</p><p>Aziraphale chuckled, the sound of small bells coming from his mouth. \u201cPlease, dear, we both know you are not\u2026 conventional. And don\u2019t get me wrong, it\u2019s a good thing. This Thomas, he must be something if you\u2019re so fond of him.\u201d He threw the last piece of bread into the pond and they started walking again, side by side.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think <i>fondness</i> is the right word. He needed help, I did my black magic thing. End of the story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re a very diligent demon, of course,\u201d the angel said wryly and Crowley rolled his eyes.</p><p>\u201cFine. I helped him because \u2014 I don\u2019t even know. But his voice was so clear, his pain so real that I couldn\u2019t help following it,\u201d he finally admitted.</p><p>Then Aziraphale did something Crowley didn\u2019t expect, at all. He put his hand on the demon\u2019s arm, squeezing slightly. Physical contact was a line they crossed only for special occasion. Crowley looked at him with wide eyes and the angel withdrew his hand immediately, blushing under all the tiny freckles on his cheeks.</p><p>Aziraphale sighed. \u201cYou did something nice, it must have felt good. I can\u2019t even remember the last time I interacted with a human being like this. <i>Just small things to help them, our duty is to keep balance</i>, they said.</p><p>He looked really sad and Crowley hated it with all of his heart. Melancholy didn\u2019t look good on \u00a0that pretty face. Maybe this could sound like a stereotype, but Aziraphale have always been the one good at comforting. Crowley didn\u2019t know what to do in this kind of situation, but he would definitely make an attempt to swipe that gloomy expression away.</p><p><i>Stupid Archangels who give stupid orders</i>.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got plenty of time to fix that. What I\u2019ve done, it was anything special. Just answer a call or two, there are so many humans that need a guardian angel\u201d, and he gave him what was supposed to be a warm and reassuring smile (like Aziraphale would do), but that probably looked more like a crooked grin. But the angel deeply appreciated it anyway.</p><p>\u201cUnless you are so scrupulous you want to stick to Heaven\u2019s rules,\u201d Crowley said amused, finally managing to get a small smile out of Aziraphale.</p><p>\u201cOh and, by the way, I\u2019m not sure you\u2019d define helping Tommy as the right choice,\u201d he added. \u201cHe\u2019s kind of a gangster, who knows what kind of dangerous shady business he\u2014,\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?!\u201d Aziraphale looked at him in disbelief, \u201cYou mean, the first time you take an interest in mankind ever, it is because of a dejected gangster?!\u201d and his voice high pitched again.</p><p><i>Aw</i>, Crowley thought, <i>that\u2019s my finicky boy</i>.</p><p>\u201cAre you surprised? Really? I\u2019m not a saint and I don\u2019t do charity. I like humans with a moral sense as twisted as mine,\u201d he sneered.</p><p>Crowley walked away, leaving Aziraphale behind. He didn\u2019t need to see his face to know it was red with disapproval and indignation.</p><p>\u201cOh, Crowley, I can\u2019t believe it! Yo\u2014 you\u2019re\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFabulous? I know, Angel. And please don\u2019t judge him from his job. Now, you have centuries of helping old ladies with their bags to catch up with. Chop chop!\u201d</p><p>***</p><p>But all the good things in life come to an end, like a bottle of fine whiskey. This thought strikes Crowley\u2019s mind every time, even though he should have learnt the lesson by now. </p><p>The day Tommy died, he got a call from Ada. He could hear the light tremble in her voice.</p><p>\u201cI thought you might like to know,\u201d she just said. He got all the details about the funeral and hung up the phone.</p><p>He knew that day would come since the beginning. Tommy was just a man, after all. No matter how long his life would last, it wouldn\u2019t have been enough.</p><p> Crowley kept himself busy for the couple of days before the funeral. He had to make calls, meet people and ask for favors. He also asked Aziraphale for help, hushing him before he could start rambling about feelings and grief, forcing a cup of tea in his cold hands.</p><p>The price was high but, in the end, he had what he wanted.</p><p><i>It\u2019s a nice place for a funeral</i>, Crowley thought stepping out his car.

The angel frowned, recollecting his thoughts while feeding the ducks.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just\u2014 I\u2019m a bit surprised. I know you enjoy some human things but, you\u2019ve never shown affection to humankind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a demon, I think it\u2019s normal,\u201d he shrugged, trying to hide himself behind his glasses.</p><p>Aziraphale chuckled, the sound of small bells coming from his mouth. \u201cPlease, dear, we both know you are not\u2026 conventional. And don\u2019t get me wrong, it\u2019s a good thing. This Thomas, he must be something if you\u2019re so fond of him.\u201d He threw the last piece of bread into the pond and they started walking again, side by side.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think <i>fondness</i> is the right word. He needed help, I did my black magic thing. End of the story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re a very diligent demon, of course,\u201d the angel said wryly and Crowley rolled his eyes.</p><p>\u201cFine.

But his voice was so clear, his pain so real that I couldn\u2019t help following it,\u201d he finally admitted.</p><p>Then Aziraphale did something Crowley didn\u2019t expect, at all. He put his hand on the demon\u2019s arm, squeezing slightly. Physical contact was a line they crossed only for special occasion.

But the angel deeply appreciated it anyway.</p><p>\u201cUnless you are so scrupulous you want to stick to Heaven\u2019s rules,\u201d Crowley said amused, finally managing to get a small smile out of Aziraphale.</p><p>\u201cOh and, by the way, I\u2019m not sure you\u2019d define helping Tommy as the right choice,\u201d he added. \u201cHe\u2019s kind of a gangster, who knows what kind of dangerous shady business he\u2014,\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?!\u201d Aziraphale looked at him in disbelief, \u201cYou mean, the first time you take an interest in mankind ever, it is because of a dejected gangster?!\u201d and his voice high pitched again.</p><p><i>Aw</i>, Crowley thought, <i>that\u2019s my finicky boy</i>.</p><p>\u201cAre you surprised? Really? I\u2019m not a saint and I don\u2019t do charity. I like humans with a moral sense as twisted as mine,\u201d he sneered.</p><p>Crowley walked away, leaving Aziraphale behind. He didn\u2019t need to see his face to know it was red with disapproval and indignation.</p><p>\u201cOh, Crowley, I can\u2019t believe it! Yo\u2014 you\u2019re\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFabulous?

He gazed at the thin line where the green fields met the sky. A small group of people, all dressed in black, was gathering slowly around a wooden cart. \u00a0He stayed away from them, watching Tommy\u2019s family crying and giving their farewell. Only Ada spotted him; she waved at him sheepishly, grabbing Karl\u2019s shoulder with the other hand.</p><p>Tommy was watching them too, sitting on a fallen trunk beside the cart.

Sometimes they met in Birmingham, sometimes in London where Tommy had business with Mr. Solomons (another odd man Crowley had the not-pleasure to meet.) Sometimes he visited Tommy at his house or in Watery Lane, therefore &nbsp;he had the chance to meet the Shelby family.</p><p>They were friends, somehow, and this was something new to both of them. Crowley have always had nothing but Aziraphale and their weird, century-old friendship (because it wasn&rsquo;t just an alliance anymore); Tommy had his noisy extended family, but he couldn&rsquo;t really say he had a friend since Freddie Thorne, and things got complicated after the war.</p><p>During their evenings they drank, smoked and talked, a lot. Sometimes alone, sometimes with Ada or Polly and, after a while, Crowley found himself quite enjoying their company as well. He liked discussing communist principles with Ada (something the world thought coming straight from hell) and talking about religion and occultism with Polly. They were sharp and clever, obviously the force holding the family and the business together. He couldn&rsquo;t understand why men were so convinced of their gender supremacy. Really.</p><p>And then, there were his brothers.</p><p>In Crowley&rsquo;s eyes, the Shelby siblings were basically a heap of angst, rage and cheekbones. Nevertheless, he could understand why ordinary people were so respectful towards them. Arthur a crazy horse, wrecked to the core but still trying to pull his shit together; John didn&rsquo;t seem to know what to do half of the time (but fortunately he had Esme, helping him the other half); Finn was just a kid trying to act like his elder brothers.</p><p>Last but not least Michael, their cousin: secure and restrained on the outside, scared and full of doubts on the inside. <i>A bit like Tommy</i>, Crowley thought after talking to him for a while.</p><p>With the right amount of alcool in their blood, they shared many bits of their private lives: Tommy talked about Grace and Charlie, about the war and his nightmares, and Crowley rambled too many things about himself and, sometimes, about Aziraphale. He vaguely remembers mentioning the fact that he had met Byron in person, and that he was a pompous haughty arse.</p><p>But they had some kind of agreement on not talking about work and business.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a matter of trust,&rdquo; Tommy explained once, \"it&rsquo;s just tha&ndash; I prefer leaving all that stuff at the office, whenever I can.&rdquo;</p><p>And they never discussed about Crowley always wearing sunglasses and the yellow eyes Tommy was sure they were covering. <i>A trick of lights</i>, the man said to himself, <i>or some kind of disease</i>. Or maybe he just preferred ignorance for once in his life.</p><p>***</p><p>Months passed, with more meetings and dinners, but Crowley and Aziraphale never talked about this Tommy-thing properly. After all the time they&rsquo;ve known each other, it was nice to still have a secret just for himself.

Crowley was kneeling on the floor in\nfront of Aziraphale\u2019s armchair, quite clothed, although he\u2019d vanished\nAziraphale\u2019s clothes right away. \u201cI want to try ssssomething\u2026 <i>Different</i>.\u201d</p><!-- more --><p>\u201cYou\u2019re beautiful,\u201d Aziraphale said,\nlooking down at him with his eyes soft, and Crowley wriggled slightly in his\nplace, leaning forward and nuzzling at Aziraphale\u2019s cock, his lips dragging\nover the base of it before he let his tongue flicker out. He liked Aziraphale\u2019s\ncock. It was a good size \u2013 Aziraphale hadn\u2019t given much thought about it when\nhe\u2019d made it, and proportionally\u2026</p><p><i>Mmm</i>. </p><p>Crowley liked the size of it. </p><p>Not that it was especially long, no:\nAziraphale wouldn\u2019t admit to it, but he was reasonably certain that Aziraphale\nhad based his cock on Crowley\u2019s own<a href=\"#_ftn1\" title=\"\">[1]</a>,\nand just made adjustments for proportion. Crowley\u2019s cock was like <i>him</i>: a little longer than average,\nslender, <i>handsome. </i>Aziraphale\u2019s cock\nwas like <i>him</i>: short, and fat, and <i>perfect</i>.</p><p>Aziraphale let out a groan as Crowley\nflicked his tongue up the length of him, tracing the neat line of his raphe as\nhe did so, and then he reached forward, cupping his bollocks in his palm and playing\nhis thumb over them, over the soft skin, the scantest traces of hair there. His\ntongue dipped into Aziraphale\u2019s slit, and Aziraphale <i>hissed</i>, his fingers dragging into Crowley\u2019s hair and tightening his\ngrip on the dark locks, and oh, it was <i>wonderful,\n</i>the lovely <i>pain</i> of it, hot drag\nat his scalp. </p><p>His fingers pressed further back, dipping\ndown between the fat cleft of Aziraphale\u2019s buttocks, and\u2014</p><p>\u201cOh, <i>angel</i>,\u201d\nCrowley muttered, and he dragged the angel forward by the backs of his knees,\nmaking him let out a yelp as he fell down against the back of the armchair, his\narse hanging over the cushion, and a bit of Crowley enjoyed the indignity of\nthat desperate little noise, so <i>sudden</i>,\nso abrupt. \u201cWould you do the whole <i>thing</i>,\nplease?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Aziraphale asked\nplaintively, his intonation uneven as Crowley sucked at the frenum, his tongue\ndragging hard against the bundle of nerves there. \u201cOh, <i>Crowley</i>, let me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me, let me, let me!\u201d Crowley repeated,\nsqueezing Aziraphale\u2019s bollocks and hearing him choke out a noise. \u201cAziraphale,\njust do what I <i>tell</i> you for once. Do\nI have to tie you down? Pin you on your back, paint Enochian symbols on your\nchest in my blood and watch you writhe in agony?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEcstasy is more my prerogative, dear boy,\u201d\nAziraphale said, a little more smugly than Crowley would like.</p><p>Crowley bit the inside of his thigh, and\nAziraphale wailed. </p><p>\u201cI <i>said</i>,\u201d\nCrowley said, pressing at the back of Aziraphale\u2019s balls once again, \u201cyou need\nto have the whole <i>thing</i>. Where\u2019s your\nprostate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a prostate!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not very accessible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a prostate, Crowley, not a <i>parking</i> spa\u2014 <i>a\u2014</i> <i>Crowley\u2014!\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cSorry,\u201d</i> Crowley said, throwing his voice without using his mouth, tongue,\nteeth, or lips. \u201c<i>My mouth is full.\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cWhat do you need it for, anyway?\u201d Aziraphale\nasked, curling his fingers through Crowley\u2019s hair and dragging at it as Crowley\nswallowed around him, his tongue curling in the most devilish way possible\naround him, wrapping around his cock again and again in <i>inhuman</i> little loops. \u201cIt\u2019s\u2014 Oh, my dear, I thought you preferred\nit when I, ah, took the superior position?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not calling it that,\u201d Crowley said,\ndragging his teeth over the crease at one of Aziraphale\u2019s thighs, feeling the\nplump flesh dip and shift under the pressure. \u201cBesides, would you complain if I\n<i>did</i> give as much as I received?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all,\u201d Aziraphale said. \u201cOf course,\nwe both know you\u2019re far too lazy for that.\u201d</p><p>Crowley closed his mouth with a click, and\nleaned back, away from Aziraphale\u2019s crotch. The angel peered down at him, his\nskin flushed, and then he fidgeted in his place, spreading his knees a little\nwider. Aziraphale shifted his hips, grinding slightly up against the empty air:\nhis hands, no longer able to tangle in Crowley\u2019s hair, settled on the arms of\nthe chair. They did not, of course, move that the angel might touch himself,\nbut Crowley could see his fingers twitch. </p><p>Crowley raised his eyebrows. </p><p>\u201c<i>Crowley,\u201d\n</i>Aziraphale said, doing his best to be stern. Of course, it was difficult to\nbe stern whilst whining, which Aziraphale was. </p><p>\u201cHm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCrowley, my dear, <i>please</i>.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, <i>do</i> return to your ministrations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy ministrations? I don\u2019t remember\nministering to anything. What was I ministering to?\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Me</i>,\ndear boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>You</i>?\nCan\u2019t imagine why I\u2019d do that. You\u2019ve not even got an anus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this fascination with my anus all\nof a sudden? Ordinarily, it\u2019s all about <i>your</i>\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would love to begin a passionate fascination\nwith your anus, angel, as soon as you have one for me to be fascinated with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just curious, my dear!\u201d </p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t satisfy that curiosity until I\nhave somewhere to <i>minister</i> my <i>ministrations</i>.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I thought\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop thinking! Just do what I say!\u201d Aziraphale\nbit his lip, looking down at him, and Crowley leaned in, nuzzling once more at\nAziraphale\u2019s cock and feeling him hiss out a noise as Crowley\u2019s breath ran hot\nover his skin. \u201cAngel, we agreed that I would drive tonight, didn\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see,\u201d Aziraphale said, a little snippily,\n\u201cwhy I can\u2019t let you drive, and still know which direction we\u2019re driving in.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Angel</i>,\u201d\nCrowley murmured, and he kissed tenderly from the side of Aziraphale\u2019s knee up\ntoward his thigh, feeling the way he shivered and twitched beneath Crowley\u2019s\nmouth, the white flesh rippling as he jolted and squirmed. He loved Aziraphale\u2019s\nthighs, loved how he could get <i>fistfuls</i>\nof them and just sink into them. They were good thighs \u2013 if he did fuck Aziraphale\ntonight, he wouldn\u2019t even <i>want</i> his\narse. He\u2019d want to sink himself between those thighs, feel them hot and soft\naround his cock, let him drag up against Aziraphale\u2019s, grab at his arse the\nwhole time\u2026 \u201cDon\u2019t you trust me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I do,\u201d Aziraphale said.</p><p>\u201cAre you frightened of what I might do to\nyou?\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>No</i>,\ndon\u2019t be silly.\u201d Aziraphale glanced away from him, his gaze flickering down to\nthe carpet, and Crowley frowned, sliding forward and letting his fingers play\nover Aziraphale\u2019s thighs, even as he drew closer, so that they were chest to\nchest, Crowley\u2019s suit dragging over the oversensitive expanse of Aziraphale\u2019s\nchest. </p><p>\u201cThen what <i>isss</i> it?\u201d Crowley asked, and his tongue flickered out, swiping over\nthe side of Aziraphale\u2019s jaw and making him whimper. Crowley grinned. \u201cOh, issss\nthat it? Do you want me to be <i>nasty</i>\nto you, angel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you mean,\u201d Aziraphale said.\nThe blossoming blush in his cheeks deepened from \u201crosy\u201d to \u201cfire-engine red\u201d. </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s <i>it</i>,\nisn\u2019t it? <i>You</i> don\u2019t want to let me be\nthe <i>superior</i> one unless I rough you\nup a little bit,\u201d Crowley murmured. It wasn\u2019t exactly how they did things, the\nother way around. Aziraphale was certainly <i>condescending</i>,\nand that sent shivers up Crowley\u2019s spine, whenever he topped. Aziraphale would whisper\npoetry and compliments against Crowley\u2019s skin, and whenever he whimpered to\nloudly or complained, or begged, Aziraphale would <i>mock</i> him, soft and low and full of honeyed humour, and that, that\nwas <i>sexy</i>.</p><p>This? This was different, but Crowley\nthought he could manage it.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s hardly\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut <i>up</i>,\nangel,\u201d Crowley murmured, and he dragged Aziraphale\u2019s lip under his teeth,\nwinding his fingers in Aziraphale\u2019s hair and pulling him into a rough, bruising\nkiss. Aziraphale gasped into his mouth, his hands moving to Crowley\u2019s hips, but\nCrowley slapped at the backs of his hands, and Aziraphale let out a heady moan,\ndragging his hands back to himself. \u201cI\u2019m going to do something so <i>nasty</i> to you. That the sort of thing you\u2019re\nlooking for? For me to torture you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cN\u2014 No,\u201d Aziraphale said, although the word\ngot stuck in his mouth, and he was looking hungrily at Crowley\u2019s mouth instead\nof at his eyes as Crowley slid down to his knees.</p><p>\u201cGo\u2014 Sa\u2014 <i>Fuck</i>,\u201d Crowley said, and he put his hand forward, dragging his\nthumb over the pink pucker there, pressing down on the muscle. </p><p>Aziraphale shivered.</p><p>\u201cThat it, angel? You want me to make you\nwail?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to see you try, dear boy,\u201d\nAziraphale said. Crowley leaned forward, breathing over the hole, and he\nwatched it twitch and clench, listened to Aziraphale\u2019s exhalation. \u201cOh,\nCrowley, surely you don\u2019t mean to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAngel,\u201d Crowley asked, very deliberately, \u201cdo\nyou want me to gag you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen, unless you\u2019re begging me to <i>do</i> something, or actually telling me to <i>stop</i>, I don\u2019t want to hear you talk.\nOoh, I suppose you can scream my name in inexorable pleasure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think that likely?\u201d Aziraphale\nasked sceptically.</p><p>Crowley went in tongue-first, and\nAziraphale moaned his name. </p><p>Crowley didn\u2019t press in, right away, just\nlet his tongue trace around the clean, wrinkled muscle: Aziraphale\u2019s skin\ntasted like sunshine and salt, although the salt was far more like sea air rather\nthan the salt that <i>human</i> skin tasted\nof. Aziraphale had heard how human skin was meant to taste, when one licked it,\nbut had never gone to the trouble of licking one to check for himself, and the\napproximation was more than good enough for Crowley, who only licked humans\nwhen it was absolutely necessary.</p><p>\u201cOh, oh, Crowley, that feels\u2026 Oh, that\nfeels\u2026\u201d He trailed off, and Crowley smirked, grabbing at Aziraphale\u2019s thighs\nand pulling them closer, so that Aziraphale\u2019s knees were over his shoulders,\nand immediately, on instinct alone, Aziraphale hooked his feet at the centre of\nCrowley\u2019s back, locking him closer. Crowley wriggled his tongue slightly,\nthreatening to press in, and Aziraphale heaved in a high-pitched gasp as his\ncock gave a <i>beautiful</i> twitch, white\nwetness pearling at the head of it. </p><p>\u201cGood, right?\u201d Crowley murmured, and then\nhe put his mouth back to work, sliding his tongue <i>in</i>: he swiped around the inside of the entrance, feeling the velvet-smooth\nflesh of Aziraphale\u2019s arse under his tongue, and Aziraphale <i>whimpered, </i>his thighs tightening in\neither side of Crowley\u2019s flesh. This? Oh, this wasn\u2019t Heaven, but it was better\n<i>than</i>. Aziraphale\u2019s thighs were warm\nand fat and pillowy, and Crowley let out a low noise in the back of his throat<a href=\"#_ftn2\" title=\"\">[2]</a> as\nhe dragged his tongue back slightly, sucking at Aziraphale\u2019s rim and making him\n<i>keen</i>. </p><p>\u201cOh, it feels <i>divine</i>,\u201d Aziraphale moaned, and Crowley decided not to go for the\nlow-hanging fruit in <i>that</i> statement,\ninstead deciding to shift his tongue forward. Crowley\u2019s tongue was long, serpentine,\nand <i>utterly</i> inhuman. It was capable,\nin fact, of many things a human tongue was not.</p><p>For example, reaching in and sweeping a\nline over the back of the little bundle of nerves that pressed against the wall\nthere, and Aziraphale really <i>did</i>\nscream. It was a loud noise, <i>very</i>\nloud, and his fingers all but <i>tore</i> at\nCrowley\u2019s hair as he ground himself down against Crowley\u2019s mouth, his knees\nlocked either side of his head, and Crowley laughed at the way his cock jumped.\n</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it\u2014 Oh, Crowley, isn\u2019t it dirty?\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>I\ndoubt it, angel,\u201d</i> Crowley said dryly, even as his tongue twisted against\nthe inside of his rim and made Aziraphale\u2019s hips jump. \u201c<i>You\u2019ve not even been using this.\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cOh, it feels\u2014 <i>Goodness</i>, Crowley, it\u2019s impossible, I really, oh, I\u2019m not hurting you,\nam I? Oh, my <i>dear</i>, do\u2014 <i>ngh</i>, do that again, please, please\u2014\u201d</p><p>Crowley sucked at the sensitive bridge of skin\nbetween Aziraphale\u2019s hole and his cock. What would Aziraphale call it \u2013 his perineum?\nMaybe his <i>guiche</i>, if he was feeling\nromantic. Whatever Aziraphale would call it, sucking it made him <i>shudder</i>, and Crowley began fucking him\nwith his tongue, grasping at his thighs as he did so.</p><p>Aziraphale didn\u2019t even <i>realise</i> he was doing it, Crowley didn\u2019t think, but he was rolling\nhis hips down and against Crowley\u2019s mouth, eager for more\u2026 Oh, yes. Yes, he\u2019d <i>definitely</i> found the good spot here.</p><p>\u201cOh, Crowley, Crowley, Crowley,\u201d Aziraphale\nchoked out, and Crowley twisted his tongue again.</p><p>Aziraphale just\u2026 <i>shattered</i>.</p><p>The noise he made was sixty obscenities in\nitself, his voice cracking, and his thighs <i>squeezed</i>\naround him, as admirably as Crowley ever could, as a constrictor, or like a\ncobra, he could never remember which<a href=\"#_ftn3\" title=\"\">[3]</a>. Crowley\nkept on moving his tongue as Aziraphale rode it out, his cock spasming and pulsing\nagainst his belly, untouched, ad it was\u2014</p><p>Oh, yes.</p><p>Oh, <i>yes</i>,\nCrowley liked this.</p><p>\u201cOh, <i>Crowley</i>,\u201d\nAziraphale choked out, and Crowley slowly withdrew, pressing kisses over the\nsoft flesh of Aziraphale\u2019s belly and looking up at him. Aziraphale wasn\u2019t sweating\n(he didn\u2019t usually like to), but there was a healthy glow to much of his skin,\nand Crowley kept on kissing up the centre of his chest. \u201cOh, Crowley, Crowley\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to fuck between your thighs,\u201d\nCrowley decided. \u201cBend you over your desk and make you come <i>just</i> like that\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that was\u2014 It was really very good,\ndear boy, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to <i>bite</i> you,\u201d Crowley said, and he watched Aziraphale squirm. \u201cI\u2019m\ngoing to bite you, and fuck you, and fuck between these thighs of yours until\nyou beg for me to stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Aziraphale said softly.</p><p>\u201cDoes that meet with your approval?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes,\u201d Aziraphale mumbled, looking dreamy-eyed\nat Crowley. \u201cYes, please.\u201d</p><p>Crowley laughed, and began kissing back\ndown. \u201cBut first,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cOh, oh, Crowley, you can hardly do it\nagain, right away, that\u2019s too much, it feels too good, I really couldn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re a <i>glutton</i>, angel,\u201d Crowley said, his tongue tracing the crease between\nAziraphale\u2019s thigh and his hip, and watching the oversensitive <i>jump</i> he gave. \u201cYou always eat my dessert\nafter finishing yours. Think of it as seconds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, oh, Crowley, I really\u2014 Oh, Crowley, my\ndear, you\u2019ll <i>kill</i> me, I, I really\nthink I will\u2014\u201d Aziraphale\u2019s whine was stuttered and desperate, but he certainly\ndidn\u2019t flinch away: he ground right up into Crowley\u2019s mouth as Crowley\nswallowed his half-soft cock down, and Crowley, if he could have grinned, <i>would</i> have.</p><p>In the meantime\u2014</p><p>\u201cOh, you <i>wicked</i> thing,\u201d Aziraphale gasped. \u201cDo that again.\u201d</p><p><a href=\"#_ftnref1\" title=\"\">[1]</a> This was the only reason, Crowley was reasonably certain, that\nAziraphale had bothered with a cock at all, and Crowley was <i>entirely</i> ready, in future, to convince\nhim to try something a little more exciting. </p><p><a href=\"#_ftnref2\" title=\"\">[2]</a> Aziraphale later informed him that this noise was <i>absolutely</i> a growl, and that he would be\never so pleased to hear it again, if Crowley would be so kind.</p><p><a href=\"#_ftnref3\" title=\"\">[3]</a> Crowley could never really decide what sort of snake he was\nsupposed to be, and oscillated wildly between herpetological descriptors in any\ncase.

His fingernails were longer than\nAziraphale\u2019s, albeit buffed to a handsome polish, and he watched Aziraphale\u2019s\nbody shift as he shivered under the touch. He didn\u2019t do it hard enough to leave\na mark, just hard to enough to <i>warn</i>\nhim \u2013 Aziraphale didn\u2019t much like pain, as much as he enjoyed inflicting it on\nCrowley\u2026 And as much as Crowley enjoyed the aforementioned affliction. \u201cStay <i>down</i>.\u201d</p><p>Aziraphale was breathing heavily, and\nCrowley watched eagerly as his chest rose and fell, as his belly shifted as he\nbreathed, and a flush had burned from his chest up the length of his neck,\nflourishing in his cheeks. \u201cCrowley,\u201d Aziraphale said breathlessly, \u201cCrowley, I\nwant to kiss you, let me kiss you, let me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cKiss me later,\u201d Crowley said, and he\nshoved Aziraphale\u2019s thighs further apart. Crowley was kneeling on the floor in\nfront of Aziraphale\u2019s armchair, quite clothed, although he\u2019d vanished\nAziraphale\u2019s clothes right away. \u201cI want to try ssssomething\u2026 <i>Different</i>.\u201d</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cYou\u2019re beautiful,\u201d Aziraphale said,\nlooking down at him with his eyes soft, and Crowley wriggled slightly in his\nplace, leaning forward and nuzzling at Aziraphale\u2019s cock, his lips dragging\nover the base of it before he let his tongue flicker out. He liked Aziraphale\u2019s\ncock. It was a good size \u2013 Aziraphale hadn\u2019t given much thought about it when\nhe\u2019d made it, and proportionally\u2026</p><p><i>Mmm</i>. </p><p>Crowley liked the size of it. </p><p>Not that it was especially long, no:\nAziraphale wouldn\u2019t admit to it, but he was reasonably certain that Aziraphale\nhad based his cock on Crowley\u2019s own<a href=\"#_ftn1\" title=\"\">[1]</a>,\nand just made adjustments for proportion. Crowley\u2019s cock was like <i>him</i>: a little longer than average,\nslender, <i>handsome. </i>Aziraphale\u2019s cock\nwas like <i>him</i>: short, and fat, and <i>perfect</i>.</p><p>Aziraphale let out a groan as Crowley\nflicked his tongue up the length of him, tracing the neat line of his raphe as\nhe did so, and then he reached forward, cupping his bollocks in his palm and playing\nhis thumb over them, over the soft skin, the scantest traces of hair there. His\ntongue dipped into Aziraphale\u2019s slit, and Aziraphale <i>hissed</i>, his fingers dragging into Crowley\u2019s hair and tightening his\ngrip on the dark locks, and oh, it was <i>wonderful,\n</i>the lovely <i>pain</i> of it, hot drag\nat his scalp. </p><p>His fingers pressed further back, dipping\ndown between the fat cleft of Aziraphale\u2019s buttocks, and\u2014</p><p>\u201cOh, <i>angel</i>,\u201d\nCrowley muttered, and he dragged the angel forward by the backs of his knees,\nmaking him let out a yelp as he fell down against the back of the armchair, his\narse hanging over the cushion, and a bit of Crowley enjoyed the indignity of\nthat desperate little noise, so <i>sudden</i>,\nso abrupt. \u201cWould you do the whole <i>thing</i>,\nplease?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Aziraphale asked\nplaintively, his intonation uneven as Crowley sucked at the frenum, his tongue\ndragging hard against the bundle of nerves there. \u201cOh, <i>Crowley</i>, let me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me, let me, let me!\u201d Crowley repeated,\nsqueezing Aziraphale\u2019s bollocks and hearing him choke out a noise. \u201cAziraphale,\njust do what I <i>tell</i> you for once. Do\nI have to tie you down? Pin you on your back, paint Enochian symbols on your\nchest in my blood and watch you writhe in agony?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEcstasy is more my prerogative, dear boy,\u201d\nAziraphale said, a little more smugly than Crowley would like.</p><p>Crowley bit the inside of his thigh, and\nAziraphale wailed. </p><p>\u201cI <i>said</i>,\u201d\nCrowley said, pressing at the back of Aziraphale\u2019s balls once again, \u201cyou need\nto have the whole <i>thing</i>. Where\u2019s your\nprostate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a prostate!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not very accessible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a prostate, Crowley, not a <i>parking</i> spa\u2014 <i>a\u2014</i> <i>Crowley\u2014!\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cSorry,\u201d</i> Crowley said, throwing his voice without using his mouth, tongue,\nteeth, or lips. \u201c<i>My mouth is full.\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cWhat do you need it for, anyway?\u201d Aziraphale\nasked, curling his fingers through Crowley\u2019s hair and dragging at it as Crowley\nswallowed around him, his tongue curling in the most devilish way possible\naround him, wrapping around his cock again and again in <i>inhuman</i> little loops. \u201cIt\u2019s\u2014 Oh, my dear, I thought you preferred\nit when I, ah, took the superior position?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not calling it that,\u201d Crowley said,\ndragging his teeth over the crease at one of Aziraphale\u2019s thighs, feeling the\nplump flesh dip and shift under the pressure. \u201cBesides, would you complain if I\n<i>did</i> give as much as I received?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all,\u201d Aziraphale said. \u201cOf course,\nwe both know you\u2019re far too lazy for that.\u201d</p><p>Crowley closed his mouth with a click, and\nleaned back, away from Aziraphale\u2019s crotch. The angel peered down at him, his\nskin flushed, and then he fidgeted in his place, spreading his knees a little\nwider. Aziraphale shifted his hips, grinding slightly up against the empty air:\nhis hands, no longer able to tangle in Crowley\u2019s hair, settled on the arms of\nthe chair. They did not, of course, move that the angel might touch himself,\nbut Crowley could see his fingers twitch. </p><p>Crowley raised his eyebrows. </p><p>\u201c<i>Crowley,\u201d\n</i>Aziraphale said, doing his best to be stern. Of course, it was difficult to\nbe stern whilst whining, which Aziraphale was. </p><p>\u201cHm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCrowley, my dear, <i>please</i>.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, <i>do</i> return to your ministrations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy ministrations? I don\u2019t remember\nministering to anything. What was I ministering to?\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Me</i>,\ndear boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>You</i>?\nCan\u2019t imagine why I\u2019d do that. You\u2019ve not even got an anus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this fascination with my anus all\nof a sudden? Ordinarily, it\u2019s all about <i>your</i>\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would love to begin a passionate fascination\nwith your anus, angel, as soon as you have one for me to be fascinated with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just curious, my dear!\u201d </p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t satisfy that curiosity until I\nhave somewhere to <i>minister</i> my <i>ministrations</i>.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I thought\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop thinking! Just do what I say!\u201d Aziraphale\nbit his lip, looking down at him, and Crowley leaned in, nuzzling once more at\nAziraphale\u2019s cock and feeling him hiss out a noise as Crowley\u2019s breath ran hot\nover his skin. \u201cAngel, we agreed that I would drive tonight, didn\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see,\u201d Aziraphale said, a little snippily,\n\u201cwhy I can\u2019t let you drive, and still know which direction we\u2019re driving in.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Angel</i>,\u201d\nCrowley murmured, and he kissed tenderly from the side of Aziraphale\u2019s knee up\ntoward his thigh, feeling the way he shivered and twitched beneath Crowley\u2019s\nmouth, the white flesh rippling as he jolted and squirmed. He loved Aziraphale\u2019s\nthighs, loved how he could get <i>fistfuls</i>\nof them and just sink into them. They were good thighs \u2013 if he did fuck Aziraphale\ntonight, he wouldn\u2019t even <i>want</i> his\narse. He\u2019d want to sink himself between those thighs, feel them hot and soft\naround his cock, let him drag up against Aziraphale\u2019s, grab at his arse the\nwhole time\u2026 \u201cDon\u2019t you trust me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I do,\u201d Aziraphale said.</p><p>\u201cAre you frightened of what I might do to\nyou?\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>No</i>,\ndon\u2019t be silly.\u201d Aziraphale glanced away from him, his gaze flickering down to\nthe carpet, and Crowley frowned, sliding forward and letting his fingers play\nover Aziraphale\u2019s thighs, even as he drew closer, so that they were chest to\nchest, Crowley\u2019s suit dragging over the oversensitive expanse of Aziraphale\u2019s\nchest. </p><p>\u201cThen what <i>isss</i> it?\u201d Crowley asked, and his tongue flickered out, swiping over\nthe side of Aziraphale\u2019s jaw and making him whimper. Crowley grinned. \u201cOh, issss\nthat it? Do you want me to be <i>nasty</i>\nto you, angel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you mean,\u201d Aziraphale said.\nThe blossoming blush in his cheeks deepened from \u201crosy\u201d to \u201cfire-engine red\u201d. </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s <i>it</i>,\nisn\u2019t it? <i>You</i> don\u2019t want to let me be\nthe <i>superior</i> one unless I rough you\nup a little bit,\u201d Crowley murmured. It wasn\u2019t exactly how they did things, the\nother way around. Aziraphale was certainly <i>condescending</i>,\nand that sent shivers up Crowley\u2019s spine, whenever he topped. Aziraphale would whisper\npoetry and compliments against Crowley\u2019s skin, and whenever he whimpered to\nloudly or complained, or begged, Aziraphale would <i>mock</i> him, soft and low and full of honeyed humour, and that, that\nwas <i>sexy</i>.</p><p>This? This was different, but Crowley\nthought he could manage it.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s hardly\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut <i>up</i>,\nangel,\u201d Crowley murmured, and he dragged Aziraphale\u2019s lip under his teeth,\nwinding his fingers in Aziraphale\u2019s hair and pulling him into a rough, bruising\nkiss. Aziraphale gasped into his mouth, his hands moving to Crowley\u2019s hips, but\nCrowley slapped at the backs of his hands, and Aziraphale let out a heady moan,\ndragging his hands back to himself. \u201cI\u2019m going to do something so <i>nasty</i> to you. That the sort of thing you\u2019re\nlooking for? For me to torture you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cN\u2014 No,\u201d Aziraphale said, although the word\ngot stuck in his mouth, and he was looking hungrily at Crowley\u2019s mouth instead\nof at his eyes as Crowley slid down to his knees.</p><p>\u201cGo\u2014 Sa\u2014 <i>Fuck</i>,\u201d Crowley said, and he put his hand forward, dragging his\nthumb over the pink pucker there, pressing down on the muscle. </p><p>Aziraphale shivered.</p><p>\u201cThat it, angel? You want me to make you\nwail?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to see you try, dear boy,\u201d\nAziraphale said. Crowley leaned forward, breathing over the hole, and he\nwatched it twitch and clench, listened to Aziraphale\u2019s exhalation. \u201cOh,\nCrowley, surely you don\u2019t mean to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAngel,\u201d Crowley asked, very deliberately, \u201cdo\nyou want me to gag you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen, unless you\u2019re begging me to <i>do</i> something, or actually telling me to <i>stop</i>, I don\u2019t want to hear you talk.\nOoh, I suppose you can scream my name in inexorable pleasure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think that likely?\u201d Aziraphale\nasked sceptically.</p><p>Crowley went in tongue-first, and\nAziraphale moaned his name. </p><p>Crowley didn\u2019t press in, right away, just\nlet his tongue trace around the clean, wrinkled muscle: Aziraphale\u2019s skin\ntasted like sunshine and salt, although the salt was far more like sea air rather\nthan the salt that <i>human</i> skin tasted\nof. Aziraphale had heard how human skin was meant to taste, when one licked it,\nbut had never gone to the trouble of licking one to check for himself, and the\napproximation was more than good enough for Crowley, who only licked humans\nwhen it was absolutely necessary.</p><p>\u201cOh, oh, Crowley, that feels\u2026 Oh, that\nfeels\u2026\u201d He trailed off, and Crowley smirked, grabbing at Aziraphale\u2019s thighs\nand pulling them closer, so that Aziraphale\u2019s knees were over his shoulders,\nand immediately, on instinct alone, Aziraphale hooked his feet at the centre of\nCrowley\u2019s back, locking him closer. Crowley wriggled his tongue slightly,\nthreatening to press in, and Aziraphale heaved in a high-pitched gasp as his\ncock gave a <i>beautiful</i> twitch, white\nwetness pearling at the head of it. </p><p>\u201cGood, right?\u201d Crowley murmured, and then\nhe put his mouth back to work, sliding his tongue <i>in</i>: he swiped around the inside of the entrance, feeling the velvet-smooth\nflesh of Aziraphale\u2019s arse under his tongue, and Aziraphale <i>whimpered, </i>his thighs tightening in\neither side of Crowley\u2019s flesh. This? Oh, this wasn\u2019t Heaven, but it was better\n<i>than</i>. Aziraphale\u2019s thighs were warm\nand fat and pillowy, and Crowley let out a low noise in the back of his throat<a href=\"#_ftn2\" title=\"\">[2]</a> as\nhe dragged his tongue back slightly, sucking at Aziraphale\u2019s rim and making him\n<i>keen</i>. </p><p>\u201cOh, it feels <i>divine</i>,\u201d Aziraphale moaned, and Crowley decided not to go for the\nlow-hanging fruit in <i>that</i> statement,\ninstead deciding to shift his tongue forward. Crowley\u2019s tongue was long, serpentine,\nand <i>utterly</i> inhuman. It was capable,\nin fact, of many things a human tongue was not.</p><p>For example, reaching in and sweeping a\nline over the back of the little bundle of nerves that pressed against the wall\nthere, and Aziraphale really <i>did</i>\nscream. It was a loud noise, <i>very</i>\nloud, and his fingers all but <i>tore</i> at\nCrowley\u2019s hair as he ground himself down against Crowley\u2019s mouth, his knees\nlocked either side of his head, and Crowley laughed at the way his cock jumped.\n</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it\u2014 Oh, Crowley, isn\u2019t it dirty?\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>I\ndoubt it, angel,\u201d</i> Crowley said dryly, even as his tongue twisted against\nthe inside of his rim and made Aziraphale\u2019s hips jump. \u201c<i>You\u2019ve not even been using this.\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cOh, it feels\u2014 <i>Goodness</i>, Crowley, it\u2019s impossible, I really, oh, I\u2019m not hurting you,\nam I? Oh, my <i>dear</i>, do\u2014 <i>ngh</i>, do that again, please, please\u2014\u201d</p><p>Crowley sucked at the sensitive bridge of skin\nbetween Aziraphale\u2019s hole and his cock. What would Aziraphale call it \u2013 his perineum?\nMaybe his <i>guiche</i>, if he was feeling\nromantic. Whatever Aziraphale would call it, sucking it made him <i>shudder</i>, and Crowley began fucking him\nwith his tongue, grasping at his thighs as he did so.</p><p>Aziraphale didn\u2019t even <i>realise</i> he was doing it, Crowley didn\u2019t think, but he was rolling\nhis hips down and against Crowley\u2019s mouth, eager for more\u2026 Oh, yes. Yes, he\u2019d <i>definitely</i> found the good spot here.</p><p>\u201cOh, Crowley, Crowley, Crowley,\u201d Aziraphale\nchoked out, and Crowley twisted his tongue again.</p><p>Aziraphale just\u2026 <i>shattered</i>.</p><p>The noise he made was sixty obscenities in\nitself, his voice cracking, and his thighs <i>squeezed</i>\naround him, as admirably as Crowley ever could, as a constrictor, or like a\ncobra, he could never remember which<a href=\"#_ftn3\" title=\"\">[3]</a>. Crowley\nkept on moving his tongue as Aziraphale rode it out, his cock spasming and pulsing\nagainst his belly, untouched, ad it was\u2014</p><p>Oh, yes.</p><p>Oh, <i>yes</i>,\nCrowley liked this.</p><p>\u201cOh, <i>Crowley</i>,\u201d\nAziraphale choked out, and Crowley slowly withdrew, pressing kisses over the\nsoft flesh of Aziraphale\u2019s belly and looking up at him. Aziraphale wasn\u2019t sweating\n(he didn\u2019t usually like to), but there was a healthy glow to much of his skin,\nand Crowley kept on kissing up the centre of his chest. \u201cOh, Crowley, Crowley\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to fuck between your thighs,\u201d\nCrowley decided. \u201cBend you over your desk and make you come <i>just</i> like that\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that was\u2014 It was really very good,\ndear boy, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to <i>bite</i> you,\u201d Crowley said, and he watched Aziraphale squirm. \u201cI\u2019m\ngoing to bite you, and fuck you, and fuck between these thighs of yours until\nyou beg for me to stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Aziraphale said softly.</p><p>\u201cDoes that meet with your approval?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes,\u201d Aziraphale mumbled, looking dreamy-eyed\nat Crowley. \u201cYes, please.\u201d</p><p>Crowley laughed, and began kissing back\ndown. \u201cBut first,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cOh, oh, Crowley, you can hardly do it\nagain, right away, that\u2019s too much, it feels too good, I really couldn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re a <i>glutton</i>, angel,\u201d Crowley said, his tongue tracing the crease between\nAziraphale\u2019s thigh and his hip, and watching the oversensitive <i>jump</i> he gave. \u201cYou always eat my dessert\nafter finishing yours. Think of it as seconds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, oh, Crowley, I really\u2014 Oh, Crowley, my\ndear, you\u2019ll <i>kill</i> me, I, I really\nthink I will\u2014\u201d Aziraphale\u2019s whine was stuttered and desperate, but he certainly\ndidn\u2019t flinch away: he ground right up into Crowley\u2019s mouth as Crowley\nswallowed his half-soft cock down, and Crowley, if he could have grinned, <i>would</i> have.</p><p>In the meantime\u2014</p><p>\u201cOh, you <i>wicked</i> thing,\u201d Aziraphale gasped. \u201cDo that again.\u201d</p><p><a href=\"#_ftnref1\" title=\"\">[1]</a> This was the only reason, Crowley was reasonably certain, that\nAziraphale had bothered with a cock at all, and Crowley was <i>entirely</i> ready, in future, to convince\nhim to try something a little more exciting. </p><p><a href=\"#_ftnref2\" title=\"\">[2]</a> Aziraphale later informed him that this noise was <i>absolutely</i> a growl, and that he would be\never so pleased to hear it again, if Crowley would be so kind.</p><p><a href=\"#_ftnref3\" title=\"\">[3]</a> Crowley could never really decide what sort of snake he was\nsupposed to be, and oscillated wildly between herpetological descriptors in any\ncase. The sort of snake Crowley was, at any time, was simply the snake he felt\nlike being. </p></p>",

His fingernails were longer than\nAziraphale\u2019s, albeit buffed to a handsome polish, and he watched Aziraphale\u2019s\nbody shift as he shivered under the touch. He didn\u2019t do it hard enough to leave\na mark, just hard to enough to <i>warn</i>\nhim \u2013 Aziraphale didn\u2019t much like pain, as much as he enjoyed inflicting it on\nCrowley\u2026 And as much as Crowley enjoyed the aforementioned affliction. \u201cStay <i>down</i>.\u201d</p><p>Aziraphale was breathing heavily, and\nCrowley watched eagerly as his chest rose and fell, as his belly shifted as he\nbreathed, and a flush had burned from his chest up the length of his neck,\nflourishing in his cheeks. \u201cCrowley,\u201d Aziraphale said breathlessly, \u201cCrowley, I\nwant to kiss you, let me kiss you, let me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cKiss me later,\u201d Crowley said, and he\nshoved Aziraphale\u2019s thighs further apart. Crowley was kneeling on the floor in\nfront of Aziraphale\u2019s armchair, quite clothed, although he\u2019d vanished\nAziraphale\u2019s clothes right away. \u201cI want to try ssssomething\u2026 <i>Different</i>.\u201d</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cYou\u2019re beautiful,\u201d Aziraphale said,\nlooking down at him with his eyes soft, and Crowley wriggled slightly in his\nplace, leaning forward and nuzzling at Aziraphale\u2019s cock, his lips dragging\nover the base of it before he let his tongue flicker out. He liked Aziraphale\u2019s\ncock. It was a good size \u2013 Aziraphale hadn\u2019t given much thought about it when\nhe\u2019d made it, and proportionally\u2026</p><p><i>Mmm</i>. </p><p>Crowley liked the size of it. </p><p>Not that it was especially long, no:\nAziraphale wouldn\u2019t admit to it, but he was reasonably certain that Aziraphale\nhad based his cock on Crowley\u2019s own<a href=\"#_ftn1\" title=\"\">[1]</a>,\nand just made adjustments for proportion. Crowley\u2019s cock was like <i>him</i>: a little longer than average,\nslender, <i>handsome. </i>Aziraphale\u2019s cock\nwas like <i>him</i>: short, and fat, and <i>perfect</i>.</p><p>Aziraphale let out a groan as Crowley\nflicked his tongue up the length of him, tracing the neat line of his raphe as\nhe did so, and then he reached forward, cupping his bollocks in his palm and playing\nhis thumb over them, over the soft skin, the scantest traces of hair there. His\ntongue dipped into Aziraphale\u2019s slit, and Aziraphale <i>hissed</i>, his fingers dragging into Crowley\u2019s hair and tightening his\ngrip on the dark locks, and oh, it was <i>wonderful,\n</i>the lovely <i>pain</i> of it, hot drag\nat his scalp. </p><p>His fingers pressed further back, dipping\ndown between the fat cleft of Aziraphale\u2019s buttocks, and\u2014</p><p>\u201cOh, <i>angel</i>,\u201d\nCrowley muttered, and he dragged the angel forward by the backs of his knees,\nmaking him let out a yelp as he fell down against the back of the armchair, his\narse hanging over the cushion, and a bit of Crowley enjoyed the indignity of\nthat desperate little noise, so <i>sudden</i>,\nso abrupt. \u201cWould you do the whole <i>thing</i>,\nplease?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Aziraphale asked\nplaintively, his intonation uneven as Crowley sucked at the frenum, his tongue\ndragging hard against the bundle of nerves there. \u201cOh, <i>Crowley</i>, let me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me, let me, let me!\u201d Crowley repeated,\nsqueezing Aziraphale\u2019s bollocks and hearing him choke out a noise. \u201cAziraphale,\njust do what I <i>tell</i> you for once. Do\nI have to tie you down? Pin you on your back, paint Enochian symbols on your\nchest in my blood and watch you writhe in agony?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEcstasy is more my prerogative, dear boy,\u201d\nAziraphale said, a little more smugly than Crowley would like.</p><p>Crowley bit the inside of his thigh, and\nAziraphale wailed. </p><p>\u201cI <i>said</i>,\u201d\nCrowley said, pressing at the back of Aziraphale\u2019s balls once again, \u201cyou need\nto have the whole <i>thing</i>. Where\u2019s your\nprostate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a prostate!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not very accessible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a prostate, Crowley, not a <i>parking</i> spa\u2014 <i>a\u2014</i> <i>Crowley\u2014!\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cSorry,\u201d</i> Crowley said, throwing his voice without using his mouth, tongue,\nteeth, or lips. \u201c<i>My mouth is full.\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cWhat do you need it for, anyway?\u201d Aziraphale\nasked, curling his fingers through Crowley\u2019s hair and dragging at it as Crowley\nswallowed around him, his tongue curling in the most devilish way possible\naround him, wrapping around his cock again and again in <i>inhuman</i> little loops. \u201cIt\u2019s\u2014 Oh, my dear, I thought you preferred\nit when I, ah, took the superior position?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not calling it that,\u201d Crowley said,\ndragging his teeth over the crease at one of Aziraphale\u2019s thighs, feeling the\nplump flesh dip and shift under the pressure. \u201cBesides, would you complain if I\n<i>did</i> give as much as I received?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all,\u201d Aziraphale said. \u201cOf course,\nwe both know you\u2019re far too lazy for that.\u201d</p><p>Crowley closed his mouth with a click, and\nleaned back, away from Aziraphale\u2019s crotch. The angel peered down at him, his\nskin flushed, and then he fidgeted in his place, spreading his knees a little\nwider. Aziraphale shifted his hips, grinding slightly up against the empty air:\nhis hands, no longer able to tangle in Crowley\u2019s hair, settled on the arms of\nthe chair. They did not, of course, move that the angel might touch himself,\nbut Crowley could see his fingers twitch. </p><p>Crowley raised his eyebrows. </p><p>\u201c<i>Crowley,\u201d\n</i>Aziraphale said, doing his best to be stern. Of course, it was difficult to\nbe stern whilst whining, which Aziraphale was. </p><p>\u201cHm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCrowley, my dear, <i>please</i>.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, <i>do</i> return to your ministrations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy ministrations? I don\u2019t remember\nministering to anything. What was I ministering to?\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Me</i>,\ndear boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>You</i>?\nCan\u2019t imagine why I\u2019d do that. You\u2019ve not even got an anus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this fascination with my anus all\nof a sudden? Ordinarily, it\u2019s all about <i>your</i>\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would love to begin a passionate fascination\nwith your anus, angel, as soon as you have one for me to be fascinated with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just curious, my dear!\u201d </p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t satisfy that curiosity until I\nhave somewhere to <i>minister</i> my <i>ministrations</i>.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I thought\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop thinking! Just do what I say!\u201d Aziraphale\nbit his lip, looking down at him, and Crowley leaned in, nuzzling once more at\nAziraphale\u2019s cock and feeling him hiss out a noise as Crowley\u2019s breath ran hot\nover his skin. \u201cAngel, we agreed that I would drive tonight, didn\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see,\u201d Aziraphale said, a little snippily,\n\u201cwhy I can\u2019t let you drive, and still know which direction we\u2019re driving in.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Angel</i>,\u201d\nCrowley murmured, and he kissed tenderly from the side of Aziraphale\u2019s knee up\ntoward his thigh, feeling the way he shivered and twitched beneath Crowley\u2019s\nmouth, the white flesh rippling as he jolted and squirmed. He loved Aziraphale\u2019s\nthighs, loved how he could get <i>fistfuls</i>\nof them and just sink into them. They were good thighs \u2013 if he did fuck Aziraphale\ntonight, he wouldn\u2019t even <i>want</i> his\narse. He\u2019d want to sink himself between those thighs, feel them hot and soft\naround his cock, let him drag up against Aziraphale\u2019s, grab at his arse the\nwhole time\u2026 \u201cDon\u2019t you trust me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I do,\u201d Aziraphale said.</p><p>\u201cAre you frightened of what I might do to\nyou?\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>No</i>,\ndon\u2019t be silly.\u201d Aziraphale glanced away from him, his gaze flickering down to\nthe carpet, and Crowley frowned, sliding forward and letting his fingers play\nover Aziraphale\u2019s thighs, even as he drew closer, so that they were chest to\nchest, Crowley\u2019s suit dragging over the oversensitive expanse of Aziraphale\u2019s\nchest. </p><p>\u201cThen what <i>isss</i> it?\u201d Crowley asked, and his tongue flickered out, swiping over\nthe side of Aziraphale\u2019s jaw and making him whimper. Crowley grinned. \u201cOh, issss\nthat it? Do you want me to be <i>nasty</i>\nto you, angel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you mean,\u201d Aziraphale said.\nThe blossoming blush in his cheeks deepened from \u201crosy\u201d to \u201cfire-engine red\u201d. </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s <i>it</i>,\nisn\u2019t it? <i>You</i> don\u2019t want to let me be\nthe <i>superior</i> one unless I rough you\nup a little bit,\u201d Crowley murmured. It wasn\u2019t exactly how they did things, the\nother way around. Aziraphale was certainly <i>condescending</i>,\nand that sent shivers up Crowley\u2019s spine, whenever he topped. Aziraphale would whisper\npoetry and compliments against Crowley\u2019s skin, and whenever he whimpered to\nloudly or complained, or begged, Aziraphale would <i>mock</i> him, soft and low and full of honeyed humour, and that, that\nwas <i>sexy</i>.</p><p>This? This was different, but Crowley\nthought he could manage it.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s hardly\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut <i>up</i>,\nangel,\u201d Crowley murmured, and he dragged Aziraphale\u2019s lip under his teeth,\nwinding his fingers in Aziraphale\u2019s hair and pulling him into a rough, bruising\nkiss. Aziraphale gasped into his mouth, his hands moving to Crowley\u2019s hips, but\nCrowley slapped at the backs of his hands, and Aziraphale let out a heady moan,\ndragging his hands back to himself. \u201cI\u2019m going to do something so <i>nasty</i> to you. That the sort of thing you\u2019re\nlooking for? For me to torture you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cN\u2014 No,\u201d Aziraphale said, although the word\ngot stuck in his mouth, and he was looking hungrily at Crowley\u2019s mouth instead\nof at his eyes as Crowley slid down to his knees.</p><p>\u201cGo\u2014 Sa\u2014 <i>Fuck</i>,\u201d Crowley said, and he put his hand forward, dragging his\nthumb over the pink pucker there, pressing down on the muscle. </p><p>Aziraphale shivered.</p><p>\u201cThat it, angel? You want me to make you\nwail?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to see you try, dear boy,\u201d\nAziraphale said. Crowley leaned forward, breathing over the hole, and he\nwatched it twitch and clench, listened to Aziraphale\u2019s exhalation. \u201cOh,\nCrowley, surely you don\u2019t mean to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAngel,\u201d Crowley asked, very deliberately, \u201cdo\nyou want me to gag you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen, unless you\u2019re begging me to <i>do</i> something, or actually telling me to <i>stop</i>, I don\u2019t want to hear you talk.\nOoh, I suppose you can scream my name in inexorable pleasure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think that likely?\u201d Aziraphale\nasked sceptically.</p><p>Crowley went in tongue-first, and\nAziraphale moaned his name. </p><p>Crowley didn\u2019t press in, right away, just\nlet his tongue trace around the clean, wrinkled muscle: Aziraphale\u2019s skin\ntasted like sunshine and salt, although the salt was far more like sea air rather\nthan the salt that <i>human</i> skin tasted\nof. Aziraphale had heard how human skin was meant to taste, when one licked it,\nbut had never gone to the trouble of licking one to check for himself, and the\napproximation was more than good enough for Crowley, who only licked humans\nwhen it was absolutely necessary.</p><p>\u201cOh, oh, Crowley, that feels\u2026 Oh, that\nfeels\u2026\u201d He trailed off, and Crowley smirked, grabbing at Aziraphale\u2019s thighs\nand pulling them closer, so that Aziraphale\u2019s knees were over his shoulders,\nand immediately, on instinct alone, Aziraphale hooked his feet at the centre of\nCrowley\u2019s back, locking him closer. Crowley wriggled his tongue slightly,\nthreatening to press in, and Aziraphale heaved in a high-pitched gasp as his\ncock gave a <i>beautiful</i> twitch, white\nwetness pearling at the head of it. </p><p>\u201cGood, right?\u201d Crowley murmured, and then\nhe put his mouth back to work, sliding his tongue <i>in</i>: he swiped around the inside of the entrance, feeling the velvet-smooth\nflesh of Aziraphale\u2019s arse under his tongue, and Aziraphale <i>whimpered, </i>his thighs tightening in\neither side of Crowley\u2019s flesh. This? Oh, this wasn\u2019t Heaven, but it was better\n<i>than</i>. Aziraphale\u2019s thighs were warm\nand fat and pillowy, and Crowley let out a low noise in the back of his throat<a href=\"#_ftn2\" title=\"\">[2]</a> as\nhe dragged his tongue back slightly, sucking at Aziraphale\u2019s rim and making him\n<i>keen</i>. </p><p>\u201cOh, it feels <i>divine</i>,\u201d Aziraphale moaned, and Crowley decided not to go for the\nlow-hanging fruit in <i>that</i> statement,\ninstead deciding to shift his tongue forward. Crowley\u2019s tongue was long, serpentine,\nand <i>utterly</i> inhuman. It was capable,\nin fact, of many things a human tongue was not.</p><p>For example, reaching in and sweeping a\nline over the back of the little bundle of nerves that pressed against the wall\nthere, and Aziraphale really <i>did</i>\nscream. It was a loud noise, <i>very</i>\nloud, and his fingers all but <i>tore</i> at\nCrowley\u2019s hair as he ground himself down against Crowley\u2019s mouth, his knees\nlocked either side of his head, and Crowley laughed at the way his cock jumped.\n</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it\u2014 Oh, Crowley, isn\u2019t it dirty?\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>I\ndoubt it, angel,\u201d</i> Crowley said dryly, even as his tongue twisted against\nthe inside of his rim and made Aziraphale\u2019s hips jump. \u201c<i>You\u2019ve not even been using this.\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cOh, it feels\u2014 <i>Goodness</i>, Crowley, it\u2019s impossible, I really, oh, I\u2019m not hurting you,\nam I? Oh, my <i>dear</i>, do\u2014 <i>ngh</i>, do that again, please, please\u2014\u201d</p><p>Crowley sucked at the sensitive bridge of skin\nbetween Aziraphale\u2019s hole and his cock. What would Aziraphale call it \u2013 his perineum?\nMaybe his <i>guiche</i>, if he was feeling\nromantic. Whatever Aziraphale would call it, sucking it made him <i>shudder</i>, and Crowley began fucking him\nwith his tongue, grasping at his thighs as he did so.</p><p>Aziraphale didn\u2019t even <i>realise</i> he was doing it, Crowley didn\u2019t think, but he was rolling\nhis hips down and against Crowley\u2019s mouth, eager for more\u2026 Oh, yes. Yes, he\u2019d <i>definitely</i> found the good spot here.</p><p>\u201cOh, Crowley, Crowley, Crowley,\u201d Aziraphale\nchoked out, and Crowley twisted his tongue again.</p><p>Aziraphale just\u2026 <i>shattered</i>.</p><p>The noise he made was sixty obscenities in\nitself, his voice cracking, and his thighs <i>squeezed</i>\naround him, as admirably as Crowley ever could, as a constrictor, or like a\ncobra, he could never remember which<a href=\"#_ftn3\" title=\"\">[3]</a>. Crowley\nkept on moving his tongue as Aziraphale rode it out, his cock spasming and pulsing\nagainst his belly, untouched, ad it was\u2014</p><p>Oh, yes.</p><p>Oh, <i>yes</i>,\nCrowley liked this.</p><p>\u201cOh, <i>Crowley</i>,\u201d\nAziraphale choked out, and Crowley slowly withdrew, pressing kisses over the\nsoft flesh of Aziraphale\u2019s belly and looking up at him. Aziraphale wasn\u2019t sweating\n(he didn\u2019t usually like to), but there was a healthy glow to much of his skin,\nand Crowley kept on kissing up the centre of his chest. \u201cOh, Crowley, Crowley\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to fuck between your thighs,\u201d\nCrowley decided. \u201cBend you over your desk and make you come <i>just</i> like that\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that was\u2014 It was really very good,\ndear boy, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to <i>bite</i> you,\u201d Crowley said, and he watched Aziraphale squirm. \u201cI\u2019m\ngoing to bite you, and fuck you, and fuck between these thighs of yours until\nyou beg for me to stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Aziraphale said softly.</p><p>\u201cDoes that meet with your approval?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes,\u201d Aziraphale mumbled, looking dreamy-eyed\nat Crowley. \u201cYes, please.\u201d</p><p>Crowley laughed, and began kissing back\ndown. \u201cBut first,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cOh, oh, Crowley, you can hardly do it\nagain, right away, that\u2019s too much, it feels too good, I really couldn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re a <i>glutton</i>, angel,\u201d Crowley said, his tongue tracing the crease between\nAziraphale\u2019s thigh and his hip, and watching the oversensitive <i>jump</i> he gave. \u201cYou always eat my dessert\nafter finishing yours.

His fingernails were longer than\nAziraphale&rsquo;s, albeit buffed to a handsome polish, and he watched Aziraphale&rsquo;s\nbody shift as he shivered under the touch. He didn&rsquo;t do it hard enough to leave\na mark, just hard to enough to <i>warn</i>\nhim &ndash; Aziraphale didn&rsquo;t much like pain, as much as he enjoyed inflicting it on\nCrowley&hellip; And as much as Crowley enjoyed the aforementioned affliction. &ldquo;Stay <i>down</i>.&rdquo;</p><p>Aziraphale was breathing heavily, and\nCrowley watched eagerly as his chest rose and fell, as his belly shifted as he\nbreathed, and a flush had burned from his chest up the length of his neck,\nflourishing in his cheeks. &ldquo;Crowley,&rdquo; Aziraphale said breathlessly, &ldquo;Crowley, I\nwant to kiss you, let me kiss you, let me&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Kiss me later,&rdquo; Crowley said, and he\nshoved Aziraphale&rsquo;s thighs further apart. Crowley was kneeling on the floor in\nfront of Aziraphale&rsquo;s armchair, quite clothed, although he&rsquo;d vanished\nAziraphale&rsquo;s clothes right away. &ldquo;I want to try ssssomething&hellip; <i>Different</i>.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re beautiful,&rdquo; Aziraphale said,\nlooking down at him with his eyes soft, and Crowley wriggled slightly in his\nplace, leaning forward and nuzzling at Aziraphale&rsquo;s cock, his lips dragging\nover the base of it before he let his tongue flicker out. He liked Aziraphale&rsquo;s\ncock. It was a good size &ndash; Aziraphale hadn&rsquo;t given much thought about it when\nhe&rsquo;d made it, and proportionally&hellip;</p><p><i>Mmm</i>. </p><p>Crowley liked the size of it. </p><p>Not that it was especially long, no:\nAziraphale wouldn&rsquo;t admit to it, but he was reasonably certain that Aziraphale\nhad based his cock on Crowley&rsquo;s own<a href=\"#_ftn1\" title=\"\">[1]</a>,\nand just made adjustments for proportion. Crowley&rsquo;s cock was like <i>him</i>: a little longer than average,\nslender, <i>handsome. </i>Aziraphale&rsquo;s cock\nwas like <i>him</i>: short, and fat, and <i>perfect</i>.</p><p>Aziraphale let out a groan as Crowley\nflicked his tongue up the length of him, tracing the neat line of his raphe as\nhe did so, and then he reached forward, cupping his bollocks in his palm and playing\nhis thumb over them, over the soft skin, the scantest traces of hair there. His\ntongue dipped into Aziraphale&rsquo;s slit, and Aziraphale <i>hissed</i>, his fingers dragging into Crowley&rsquo;s hair and tightening his\ngrip on the dark locks, and oh, it was <i>wonderful,\n</i>the lovely <i>pain</i> of it, hot drag\nat his scalp. </p><p>His fingers pressed further back, dipping\ndown between the fat cleft of Aziraphale&rsquo;s buttocks, and&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, <i>angel</i>,&rdquo;\nCrowley muttered, and he dragged the angel forward by the backs of his knees,\nmaking him let out a yelp as he fell down against the back of the armchair, his\narse hanging over the cushion, and a bit of Crowley enjoyed the indignity of\nthat desperate little noise, so <i>sudden</i>,\nso abrupt. &ldquo;Would you do the whole <i>thing</i>,\nplease?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; Aziraphale asked\nplaintively, his intonation uneven as Crowley sucked at the frenum, his tongue\ndragging hard against the bundle of nerves there. &ldquo;Oh, <i>Crowley</i>, let me&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Let me, let me, let me!&rdquo; Crowley repeated,\nsqueezing Aziraphale&rsquo;s bollocks and hearing him choke out a noise. &ldquo;Aziraphale,\njust do what I <i>tell</i> you for once. Do\nI have to tie you down? Pin you on your back, paint Enochian symbols on your\nchest in my blood and watch you writhe in agony?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ecstasy is more my prerogative, dear boy,&rdquo;\nAziraphale said, a little more smugly than Crowley would like.</p><p>Crowley bit the inside of his thigh, and\nAziraphale wailed. </p><p>&ldquo;I <i>said</i>,&rdquo;\nCrowley said, pressing at the back of Aziraphale&rsquo;s balls once again, &ldquo;you need\nto have the whole <i>thing</i>. Where&rsquo;s your\nprostate?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I have a prostate!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not very accessible.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a prostate, Crowley, not a <i>parking</i> spa&mdash; <i>a&mdash;</i> <i>Crowley&mdash;!&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo;</i> Crowley said, throwing his voice without using his mouth, tongue,\nteeth, or lips. &ldquo;<i>My mouth is full.&rdquo;</i></p><p>&ldquo;What do you need it for, anyway?&rdquo; Aziraphale\nasked, curling his fingers through Crowley&rsquo;s hair and dragging at it as Crowley\nswallowed around him, his tongue curling in the most devilish way possible\naround him, wrapping around his cock again and again in <i>inhuman</i> little loops. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s&mdash; Oh, my dear, I thought you preferred\nit when I, ah, took the superior position?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not calling it that,&rdquo; Crowley said,\ndragging his teeth over the crease at one of Aziraphale&rsquo;s thighs, feeling the\nplump flesh dip and shift under the pressure. &ldquo;Besides, would you complain if I\n<i>did</i> give as much as I received?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; Aziraphale said. &ldquo;Of course,\nwe both know you&rsquo;re far too lazy for that.&rdquo;</p><p>Crowley closed his mouth with a click, and\nleaned back, away from Aziraphale&rsquo;s crotch. The angel peered down at him, his\nskin flushed, and then he fidgeted in his place, spreading his knees a little\nwider. Aziraphale shifted his hips, grinding slightly up against the empty air:\nhis hands, no longer able to tangle in Crowley&rsquo;s hair, settled on the arms of\nthe chair. They did not, of course, move that the angel might touch himself,\nbut Crowley could see his fingers twitch. </p><p>Crowley raised his eyebrows. </p><p>&ldquo;<i>Crowley,&rdquo;\n</i>Aziraphale said, doing his best to be stern. Of course, it was difficult to\nbe stern whilst whining, which Aziraphale was. </p><p>&ldquo;Hm?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Crowley, my dear, <i>please</i>.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Please, what?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Please, <i>do</i> return to your ministrations.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;My ministrations? I don&rsquo;t remember\nministering to anything. What was I ministering to?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Me</i>,\ndear boy.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;<i>You</i>?\nCan&rsquo;t imagine why I&rsquo;d do that. You&rsquo;ve not even got an anus.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this fascination with my anus all\nof a sudden? Ordinarily, it&rsquo;s all about <i>your</i>&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I would love to begin a passionate fascination\nwith your anus, angel, as soon as you have one for me to be fascinated with.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just curious, my dear!&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t satisfy that curiosity until I\nhave somewhere to <i>minister</i> my <i>ministrations</i>.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But I thought&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Stop thinking! Just do what I say!&rdquo; Aziraphale\nbit his lip, looking down at him, and Crowley leaned in, nuzzling once more at\nAziraphale&rsquo;s cock and feeling him hiss out a noise as Crowley&rsquo;s breath ran hot\nover his skin. &ldquo;Angel, we agreed that I would drive tonight, didn&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see,&rdquo; Aziraphale said, a little snippily,\n&ldquo;why I can&rsquo;t let you drive, and still know which direction we&rsquo;re driving in.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Angel</i>,&rdquo;\nCrowley murmured, and he kissed tenderly from the side of Aziraphale&rsquo;s knee up\ntoward his thigh, feeling the way he shivered and twitched beneath Crowley&rsquo;s\nmouth, the white flesh rippling as he jolted and squirmed. He loved Aziraphale&rsquo;s\nthighs, loved how he could get <i>fistfuls</i>\nof them and just sink into them. They were good thighs &ndash; if he did fuck Aziraphale\ntonight, he wouldn&rsquo;t even <i>want</i> his\narse. He&rsquo;d want to sink himself between those thighs, feel them hot and soft\naround his cock, let him drag up against Aziraphale&rsquo;s, grab at his arse the\nwhole time&hellip; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you trust me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Of course I do,&rdquo; Aziraphale said.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you frightened of what I might do to\nyou?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;<i>No</i>,\ndon&rsquo;t be silly.&rdquo; Aziraphale glanced away from him, his gaze flickering down to\nthe carpet, and Crowley frowned, sliding forward and letting his fingers play\nover Aziraphale&rsquo;s thighs, even as he drew closer, so that they were chest to\nchest, Crowley&rsquo;s suit dragging over the oversensitive expanse of Aziraphale&rsquo;s\nchest. </p><p>&ldquo;Then what <i>isss</i> it?&rdquo; Crowley asked, and his tongue flickered out, swiping over\nthe side of Aziraphale&rsquo;s jaw and making him whimper. Crowley grinned. &ldquo;Oh, issss\nthat it? Do you want me to be <i>nasty</i>\nto you, angel?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you mean,&rdquo; Aziraphale said.\nThe blossoming blush in his cheeks deepened from &ldquo;rosy&rdquo; to &ldquo;fire-engine red&rdquo;. </p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s <i>it</i>,\nisn&rsquo;t it? <i>You</i> don&rsquo;t want to let me be\nthe <i>superior</i> one unless I rough you\nup a little bit,&rdquo; Crowley murmured. It wasn&rsquo;t exactly how they did things, the\nother way around. Aziraphale was certainly <i>condescending</i>,\nand that sent shivers up Crowley&rsquo;s spine, whenever he topped. Aziraphale would whisper\npoetry and compliments against Crowley&rsquo;s skin, and whenever he whimpered to\nloudly or complained, or begged, Aziraphale would <i>mock</i> him, soft and low and full of honeyed humour, and that, that\nwas <i>sexy</i>.</p><p>This? This was different, but Crowley\nthought he could manage it.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s hardly&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Shut <i>up</i>,\nangel,&rdquo; Crowley murmured, and he dragged Aziraphale&rsquo;s lip under his teeth,\nwinding his fingers in Aziraphale&rsquo;s hair and pulling him into a rough, bruising\nkiss. Aziraphale gasped into his mouth, his hands moving to Crowley&rsquo;s hips, but\nCrowley slapped at the backs of his hands, and Aziraphale let out a heady moan,\ndragging his hands back to himself. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to do something so <i>nasty</i> to you. That the sort of thing you&rsquo;re\nlooking for? For me to torture you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;N&mdash; No,&rdquo; Aziraphale said, although the word\ngot stuck in his mouth, and he was looking hungrily at Crowley&rsquo;s mouth instead\nof at his eyes as Crowley slid down to his knees.</p><p>&ldquo;Go&mdash; Sa&mdash; <i>Fuck</i>,&rdquo; Crowley said, and he put his hand forward, dragging his\nthumb over the pink pucker there, pressing down on the muscle. </p><p>Aziraphale shivered.</p><p>&ldquo;That it, angel? You want me to make you\nwail?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to see you try, dear boy,&rdquo;\nAziraphale said. Crowley leaned forward, breathing over the hole, and he\nwatched it twitch and clench, listened to Aziraphale&rsquo;s exhalation. &ldquo;Oh,\nCrowley, surely you don&rsquo;t mean to&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Angel,&rdquo; Crowley asked, very deliberately, &ldquo;do\nyou want me to gag you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, thank you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then, unless you&rsquo;re begging me to <i>do</i> something, or actually telling me to <i>stop</i>, I don&rsquo;t want to hear you talk.\nOoh, I suppose you can scream my name in inexorable pleasure.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Do you think that likely?&rdquo; Aziraphale\nasked sceptically.</p><p>Crowley went in tongue-first, and\nAziraphale moaned his name. </p><p>Crowley didn&rsquo;t press in, right away, just\nlet his tongue trace around the clean, wrinkled muscle: Aziraphale&rsquo;s skin\ntasted like sunshine and salt, although the salt was far more like sea air rather\nthan the salt that <i>human</i> skin tasted\nof. Aziraphale had heard how human skin was meant to taste, when one licked it,\nbut had never gone to the trouble of licking one to check for himself, and the\napproximation was more than good enough for Crowley, who only licked humans\nwhen it was absolutely necessary.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, oh, Crowley, that feels&hellip; Oh, that\nfeels&hellip;&rdquo; He trailed off, and Crowley smirked, grabbing at Aziraphale&rsquo;s thighs\nand pulling them closer, so that Aziraphale&rsquo;s knees were over his shoulders,\nand immediately, on instinct alone, Aziraphale hooked his feet at the centre of\nCrowley&rsquo;s back, locking him closer. Crowley wriggled his tongue slightly,\nthreatening to press in, and Aziraphale heaved in a high-pitched gasp as his\ncock gave a <i>beautiful</i> twitch, white\nwetness pearling at the head of it. </p><p>&ldquo;Good, right?&rdquo; Crowley murmured, and then\nhe put his mouth back to work, sliding his tongue <i>in</i>: he swiped around the inside of the entrance, feeling the velvet-smooth\nflesh of Aziraphale&rsquo;s arse under his tongue, and Aziraphale <i>whimpered, </i>his thighs tightening in\neither side of Crowley&rsquo;s flesh. This? Oh, this wasn&rsquo;t Heaven, but it was better\n<i>than</i>. Aziraphale&rsquo;s thighs were warm\nand fat and pillowy, and Crowley let out a low noise in the back of his throat<a href=\"#_ftn2\" title=\"\">[2]</a> as\nhe dragged his tongue back slightly, sucking at Aziraphale&rsquo;s rim and making him\n<i>keen</i>. </p><p>&ldquo;Oh, it feels <i>divine</i>,&rdquo; Aziraphale moaned, and Crowley decided not to go for the\nlow-hanging fruit in <i>that</i> statement,\ninstead deciding to shift his tongue forward. Crowley&rsquo;s tongue was long, serpentine,\nand <i>utterly</i> inhuman. It was capable,\nin fact, of many things a human tongue was not.</p><p>For example, reaching in and sweeping a\nline over the back of the little bundle of nerves that pressed against the wall\nthere, and Aziraphale really <i>did</i>\nscream. It was a loud noise, <i>very</i>\nloud, and his fingers all but <i>tore</i> at\nCrowley&rsquo;s hair as he ground himself down against Crowley&rsquo;s mouth, his knees\nlocked either side of his head, and Crowley laughed at the way his cock jumped.\n</p><p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it&mdash; Oh, Crowley, isn&rsquo;t it dirty?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;<i>I\ndoubt it, angel,&rdquo;</i> Crowley said dryly, even as his tongue twisted against\nthe inside of his rim and made Aziraphale&rsquo;s hips jump. &ldquo;<i>You&rsquo;ve not even been using this.&rdquo;</i></p><p>&ldquo;Oh, it feels&mdash; <i>Goodness</i>, Crowley, it&rsquo;s impossible, I really, oh, I&rsquo;m not hurting you,\nam I? Oh, my <i>dear</i>, do&mdash; <i>ngh</i>, do that again, please, please&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>Crowley sucked at the sensitive bridge of skin\nbetween Aziraphale&rsquo;s hole and his cock. What would Aziraphale call it &ndash; his perineum?\nMaybe his <i>guiche</i>, if he was feeling\nromantic. Whatever Aziraphale would call it, sucking it made him <i>shudder</i>, and Crowley began fucking him\nwith his tongue, grasping at his thighs as he did so.</p><p>Aziraphale didn&rsquo;t even <i>realise</i> he was doing it, Crowley didn&rsquo;t think, but he was rolling\nhis hips down and against Crowley&rsquo;s mouth, eager for more&hellip; Oh, yes. Yes, he&rsquo;d <i>definitely</i> found the good spot here.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, Crowley, Crowley, Crowley,&rdquo; Aziraphale\nchoked out, and Crowley twisted his tongue again.</p><p>Aziraphale just&hellip; <i>shattered</i>.</p><p>The noise he made was sixty obscenities in\nitself, his voice cracking, and his thighs <i>squeezed</i>\naround him, as admirably as Crowley ever could, as a constrictor, or like a\ncobra, he could never remember which<a href=\"#_ftn3\" title=\"\">[3]</a>. Crowley\nkept on moving his tongue as Aziraphale rode it out, his cock spasming and pulsing\nagainst his belly, untouched, ad it was&mdash;</p><p>Oh, yes.</p><p>Oh, <i>yes</i>,\nCrowley liked this.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, <i>Crowley</i>,&rdquo;\nAziraphale choked out, and Crowley slowly withdrew, pressing kisses over the\nsoft flesh of Aziraphale&rsquo;s belly and looking up at him. Aziraphale wasn&rsquo;t sweating\n(he didn&rsquo;t usually like to), but there was a healthy glow to much of his skin,\nand Crowley kept on kissing up the centre of his chest. &ldquo;Oh, Crowley, Crowley&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to fuck between your thighs,&rdquo;\nCrowley decided. &ldquo;Bend you over your desk and make you come <i>just</i> like that&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, that was&mdash; It was really very good,\ndear boy, I&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to <i>bite</i> you,&rdquo; Crowley said, and he watched Aziraphale squirm. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m\ngoing to bite you, and fuck you, and fuck between these thighs of yours until\nyou beg for me to stop.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; Aziraphale said softly.</p><p>&ldquo;Does that meet with your approval?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; Aziraphale mumbled, looking dreamy-eyed\nat Crowley. &ldquo;Yes, please.&rdquo;</p><p>Crowley laughed, and began kissing back\ndown. &ldquo;But first,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, oh, Crowley, you can hardly do it\nagain, right away, that&rsquo;s too much, it feels too good, I really couldn&rsquo;t&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;re a <i>glutton</i>, angel,&rdquo; Crowley said, his tongue tracing the crease between\nAziraphale&rsquo;s thigh and his hip, and watching the oversensitive <i>jump</i> he gave. &ldquo;You always eat my dessert\nafter finishing yours. Think of it as seconds.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, oh, Crowley, I really&mdash; Oh, Crowley, my\ndear, you&rsquo;ll <i>kill</i> me, I, I really\nthink I will&mdash;&rdquo; Aziraphale&rsquo;s whine was stuttered and desperate, but he certainly\ndidn&rsquo;t flinch away: he ground right up into Crowley&rsquo;s mouth as Crowley\nswallowed his half-soft cock down, and Crowley, if he could have grinned, <i>would</i> have.</p><p>In the meantime&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, you <i>wicked</i> thing,&rdquo; Aziraphale gasped. &ldquo;Do that again.&rdquo;</p><p><a href=\"#_ftnref1\" title=\"\">[1]</a> This was the only reason, Crowley was reasonably certain, that\nAziraphale had bothered with a cock at all, and Crowley was <i>entirely</i> ready, in future, to convince\nhim to try something a little more exciting. </p><p><a href=\"#_ftnref2\" title=\"\">[2]</a> Aziraphale later informed him that this noise was <i>absolutely</i> a growl, and that he would be\never so pleased to hear it again, if Crowley would be so kind.</p><p><a href=\"#_ftnref3\" title=\"\">[3]</a> Crowley could never really decide what sort of snake he was\nsupposed to be, and oscillated wildly between herpetological descriptors in any\ncase.
