And, well, y\u2019know\u2026 Heh, Bakugou\u2019s still nagging me about my reaction time being too slow.\u201d</p><p>The class rep smiled, getting to his feet and resting his hands on his hips. \u201cWell, alright, Kirishima. Let\u2019s see what you can handle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go easy on me, Emergency Exit.\u201d Eijirou taunted playfully, rolling his shoulder one last time. \u201cBring it o\u2014\u201d</p><p>The redhead flinched slightly when Iida\u2019s engines fired and a kick was suddenly being aimed at the side of his head. He just barely managed to block it, though it still hurt like crazy since he hadn\u2019t been able to brace his arm in time. He winced and rubbed his forearm as the class rep backed off.</p><p>\u201cAre you alright?\u201d Tenya asked, already worried and running over to check his arm. There was a red bruise forming, but Kirishima flexed his fingers easily and shook him off, that same grin stuck on his face.</p><p>\u201cAw, c\u2019mon, that was just the first one;\u201d Eijirou said happily. \u201cbring it again, I\u2019ll be ready!\u201d</p><p>It took a bit more convincing this time, but Iida nodded again and went back to his own position. The next few minutes continued pretty easily, with Kirishima slowly making progress and playfully calling out Tenya whenever he started going easy on him. He got into a rhythm of bracing himself at about the instant Iida\u2019s feet left the ground, and only relaxing after the kick had landed.</p><p>\u201cHe is getting better.\u201d Izuku murmured to Uraraka, the pair standing under a tree near the training ground.</p><p>She nodded with a smile, hands tucked into her pockets. \u201cShould we get him now?\u201d</p><p>Deku pulled his notebook and pencil from his bag, along with a small timer. \u201cDefinitely. Right when he deflects the next kick.\u201d</p><p>Occhaco gave a thumbs-up, and a few seconds later, Iida\u2019s leg was pushed away by Kirishima\u2019s hardened hands. Uraraka slipped up behind him first, pressing her fingers into his sides. He yelped and flinched away, instinctively triggering his quirk and flailing as his sudden lack of gravity sent him floating gently above the ground. Tenya chuckled, moving to catch him and work his own fingers into the redhead\u2019s ribs. Eijirou held his breath as he bit his lip and snickered, trying to struggle out of the class rep\u2019s arms while keeping his torso solid.</p><p>Nearby, Deku tapped his chin with his pencil as he observed. He giggled softly before starting the log, walking closer to keep a better watch.</p><p><i>Subject triggered his quirk immediately as the experiment started. Upon observation, the Hardening quirk apparently dulls sensation to a point, but does not nullify it completely.</i></p><p>\u201cAw, c\u2019mon, Kirishima!\u201d Uraraka teased, her fingers scribbling with Iida\u2019s up and down Eijirou\u2019s torso. \u201cYou have to breathe at some point, anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree; it\u2019d be better for your own health to just let go.\u201d Iida smirked just slightly and moved his hands to dig under Eijirou\u2019s arms. He cried out almost instantly, starting to laugh and pulling his arms in tightly. The skin on his arms and shoulders grew harder, but it faltered much faster than it had before. Deku checked and noted his timer before closing his pencil in the notebook and tucking it into his jacket.</p><p>\u201cHow about right here?\u201d He asked, reaching up to tickle the redhead\u2019s neck. Kirishima tried to struggle away from them again, laughing brightly as his face started to turn a slightly troubling red. In the same instance, his skin returned to normal; Ochaco alerted them with a teasing goose to their subject\u2019s softened waist.</p><p>\u201cAlright, I think we got it.\u201d Izuku said happily, checking his timer again and quickly pulling out his notebook.</p><p><i>Hardening Quirk seems to be entirely dependent on Subject\u2019s breath, its strength deteriorating faster the more he laughs and moves.</i></p><p><i>Initial Deterioration: 68 seconds</i></p><p><i>Critical Failure: 214 seconds</i></p><p><i>Weak spots: Underarms, Neck </i></p><p>\u201cWhat the hell was that for?\u201d Kirishima giggled as Uraraka released him from her quirk and Iida set him down.</p><p>\u201cJust a little experiment.\u201d Deku smiled brightly. \u201cEveryone okay?\u201d He asked, a bit of concern on his face when he noticed Iida flexing his fingers in discomfort.</p><p>\u201cA bit sore, but I\u2019m fine. Your Quirk really is quite tough, Kirishima.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have to use the pads of your fingers more than the tips so you don\u2019t jam your nails.\u201d Uraraka explained with a giggle, making poor Kirishima unable to even accept that compliment through his embarrassment. It didn\u2019t help that Deku seemed to be adding that to his notes.</p><p>\u201cAm I the only one you\u2019ve done this to?\u201d The redhead asked softly, crossing his arms.</p><p>\u201cWell, yes.\u201d Izuku said, flipping through his book. \u201cSo far, at least. Hm\u2026 Do you think you could help us get our next subject?\u201d He showed Eijirou the pages, tapping lightly where he\u2019d written the name.</p><p>\u201cHeh. Oh, definitely.\u201d He chuckled, smiling and patting Iida\u2019s arm. \u201cSame time tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>The class rep nodded, and Midoriya sighed with a grin as they were left to make up their own strategy for the next day.</p><p><i>Test Result: Success</i></p>",

He yelped and flinched away, instinctively triggering his quirk and flailing as his sudden lack of gravity sent him floating gently above the ground. Tenya chuckled, moving to catch him and work his own fingers into the redhead\u2019s ribs. Eijirou held his breath as he bit his lip and snickered, trying to struggle out of the class rep\u2019s arms while keeping his torso solid.</p><p>Nearby, Deku tapped his chin with his pencil as he observed.

He cried out almost instantly, starting to laugh and pulling his arms in tightly. The skin on his arms and shoulders grew harder, but it faltered much faster than it had before. Deku checked and noted his timer before closing his pencil in the notebook and tucking it into his jacket.</p><p>\u201cHow about right here?\u201d He asked, reaching up to tickle the redhead\u2019s neck. Kirishima tried to struggle away from them again, laughing brightly as his face started to turn a slightly troubling red. In the same instance, his skin returned to normal; Ochaco alerted them with a teasing goose to their subject\u2019s softened waist.</p><p>\u201cAlright, I think we got it.\u201d Izuku said happily, checking his timer again and quickly pulling out his notebook.</p><p><i>Hardening Quirk seems to be entirely dependent on Subject\u2019s breath, its strength deteriorating faster the more he laughs and moves.</i></p><p><i>Initial Deterioration: 68 seconds</i></p><p><i>Critical Failure: 214 seconds</i></p><p><i>Weak spots: Underarms, Neck </i></p><p>\u201cWhat the hell was that for?\u201d Kirishima giggled as Uraraka released him from her quirk and Iida set him down.</p><p>\u201cJust a little experiment.\u201d Deku smiled brightly. \u201cEveryone okay?\u201d He asked, a bit of concern on his face when he noticed Iida flexing his fingers in discomfort.</p><p>\u201cA bit sore, but I\u2019m fine.

Hm\u2026 Do you think you could help us get our next subject?\u201d He showed Eijirou the pages, tapping lightly where he\u2019d written the name.</p><p>\u201cHeh. Oh, definitely.\u201d He chuckled, smiling and patting Iida\u2019s arm. \u201cSame time tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>The class rep nodded, and Midoriya sighed with a grin as they were left to make up their own strategy for the next day.</p><p><i>Test Result: Success</i></p>",

And, well, y\u2019know\u2026 Heh, Bakugou\u2019s still nagging me about my reaction time being too slow.\u201d</p><p>The class rep smiled, getting to his feet and resting his hands on his hips. \u201cWell, alright, Kirishima. Let\u2019s see what you can handle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go easy on me, Emergency Exit.\u201d Eijirou taunted playfully, rolling his shoulder one last time. \u201cBring it o\u2014\u201d</p><p>The redhead flinched slightly when Iida\u2019s engines fired and a kick was suddenly being aimed at the side of his head. He just barely managed to block it, though it still hurt like crazy since he hadn\u2019t been able to brace his arm in time. He winced and rubbed his forearm as the class rep backed off.</p><p>\u201cAre you alright?\u201d Tenya asked, already worried and running over to check his arm. There was a red bruise forming, but Kirishima flexed his fingers easily and shook him off, that same grin stuck on his face.</p><p>\u201cAw, c\u2019mon, that was just the first one;\u201d Eijirou said happily. \u201cbring it again, I\u2019ll be ready!\u201d</p><p>It took a bit more convincing this time, but Iida nodded again and went back to his own position. The next few minutes continued pretty easily, with Kirishima slowly making progress and playfully calling out Tenya whenever he started going easy on him. He got into a rhythm of bracing himself at about the instant Iida\u2019s feet left the ground, and only relaxing after the kick had landed.</p><p>\u201cHe is getting better.\u201d Izuku murmured to Uraraka, the pair standing under a tree near the training ground.</p><p>She nodded with a smile, hands tucked into her pockets. \u201cShould we get him now?\u201d</p><p>Deku pulled his notebook and pencil from his bag, along with a small timer. \u201cDefinitely.
