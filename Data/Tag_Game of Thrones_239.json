Well Bronn wasn&rsquo;t exactly what you would call a guard more likely one of few Tyrion&rsquo;s good friends who didn&rsquo;t judge him for being an imp. As the only real child of Robert Baratheon and Cersei Lannister (unlike Tommen, Myrcella and Joffrey) it was expected of you to welcome the prince of Dorne in Kingslanding.</p><p>\u00a0But unsurprisingly the prince went straight to the most popular brothel in the city instead of waiting for you and Tyrion to welcome him. There were rumors of the prince&rsquo;s appetite in both men and women alike but you didn&rsquo;t expect him to practically ignore you both.</p><p>\u00a0You made your way into the room where prince Oberyn was supposed to be, only to be greeted with the sight of the prince&rsquo;s dagger being stabbed through a lannister guard&rsquo;s hand. The gasp that escaped past your lips made prince Oberyn retract his weapon and turn to face the intruders as the other guard took his friend to the closest maester.\u00a0</p><p>Seeing the prince in his full glory you couldn&rsquo;t help but admit that the rumors of his good looks were most certainly true. Dark hair which you wanted to run your fingers through so badly, piercing onyx eyes that seemed to be looking into your very soul and his lean muscular chest revealed thanks to his exotic choice of clothing.</p><p>\u00a0Prince Oberyn looked at all of you only letting his gaze linger on a bit longer on you. Out of nowhere a dornish looking woman ran to him and pulled him into a lustful and passionate kiss.</p><p>&ldquo;Ellaria Sand, my paramour.&rdquo; the prince introduced his lover with a certain amount of pride in his silky smooth voice. No wonder he was so proud to call her his, she was a very beautiful woman.</p><p>\u00a0Dark hair which reached all the way to her waist, olive-like skin with as nearly dark eyes as the prince&rsquo;s but what added to her beauty the most were probably her high cheekbones that gave her a natural look of elegance. </p><p>&ldquo;Tyrion Lannister, the lord Tywin&rsquo;s own imp. And who may this beautiful lady be?&rdquo; the prince asked as he pulled away from Ellaria and gazed at you which resulted in his lover sending you a wink over his shoulder with a seductive smile. If the prince knew, he didn&rsquo;t show it and instead made his way towards you. </p><p>&ldquo;My niece, (Y/N) of house Baratheon.&rdquo; Tyrion spoke uncertainly since he assumed the prince would know of the famous princess. Word has gone all over Westeros about the only dark haired daughter of King Robert Baratheon (rest in peace Robbie :D).</p><p>\u00a0Oberyn&rsquo;s eyes seemed to light up with a sense of mischief and adoration for the dark haired girl in front of him. He brought your hand to his lips and placed a delicate kiss to your knuckles. </p><p>&ldquo;My lady.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Prince Oberyn.&rdquo; you curtsied making the prince smirk. </p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think it is a little inappropriate to leave without informing anyone about it, only to be found in a brothel of all places?&rdquo; you questioned the tanned prince with a smirk of your own and a hint of amusement in your eyes. This made the prince laugh and turn to Tyrion once again, saying.</p><p>&ldquo;It seems like the lady has been spending way too much time with you. Smart and witty just like you lord Tyrion. A rare combination in a woman.&rdquo; Oberyn stated as he poured himself some wine. </p><p>&ldquo;Would you like to sit?&rdquo; he asked (Y/N) gesturing to the now empty bed before sitting on the end himself. </p><p>&ldquo;I think we need to talk, my prince.&rdquo; Tyrion said with a raised eyebrow when he saw his niece was about to take up on the prince&rsquo;s offer. </p><p>&ldquo;Of course, talk.&rdquo; Oberyn said while taking a sip of his wine and smiling at you. </p><p>&ldquo;Alone.&rdquo; Tyrion said sternly not liking what was going on between his niece and the Red Viper of Dorne. Oberyn let out an annoyed sight but nodded. You quickly made your way towards Ellaria and linked your arms together before leading her out of the brothel. </p><p><i>- time skip -</i></p><p>Over the next few days you spent most of your time with Oberyn and Ellaria to your family&rsquo;s utter dismay. Sometimes you asked them about Dorne and what it was like there, other times you and Oberyn would train your fighting skills together, the prince with his spear and you with your daggers or bow and arrows.</p><p>\u00a0Ellaria would always teach you about what other women in Dorne wore until you pretty much begged Oberyn to promise you that once they were to return they would take you with them. Spending more and more time with the Dornish duo somehow resulted in not only Ellaria being Oberyn&rsquo;s paramour but now you as well. The three of you shared each other, spent passionate nights together and loved each other. This night was different.</p><p>\u00a0You layed with your head on Oberyn&rsquo;s chest and traced invisible patterns on his skin as you layed in his bed once again. This time however, without Ellaria as she excused herself because of exhaustion. </p><p>&ldquo;Is something wrong, my love?&rdquo; Oberyn&rsquo;s voice sounded through the room. Of course he would notice, after all he knew you better than your own mother. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m scared Oberyn. I-i think I&rsquo;m with a child.&rdquo; you said as you pulled away to look at him. Seeing how his face lit up at your news you frowned, he opened his mouth to say something but you cut him off. </p><p>&ldquo;And don&rsquo;t you dare to say that it&rsquo;s amazing because it&rsquo;s not!&rdquo; you exclaimed as the tears started to build and threatened to escape your eyes. </p><p>&ldquo;What are you saying? Of course it&rsquo;s amazing.&rdquo; Oberyn&rsquo;s eyes showed nothing but confusion as he sat up too. </p><p>&ldquo;No! Do you know what my mother will do if she finds out? Seven hells, we are not even married Oberyn!&rdquo; you sobbed as he pulled you into a hug, trying to calm you down he said.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, then it&rsquo;s probably good that I asked your mother for your hand in marriage, don&rsquo;t you think my love?&rdquo; you pulled away and stared at him in disbelief before crashing your lips on his and snaking your arms around his neck. Oberyn kissed you back, his arms finding their way to your waist and lifting you up just to place you on his naked lap as he leaned back into the pillows.</p><p>\u00a0Kissing down his neck you rolled your hips grinding into him. Hearing the moan that slipped past Oberyn&rsquo;s lips you lifted yourself up a little, just enough to grab his length and guide him to your entrance before lowering yourself back down.\u00a0</p><p>Throwing your head back in pure bliss you missed the look of lust in Oberyn&rsquo;s eyes as he bucked his hips up into you making you moan. You placed your hands on his chest before lifting yourself up once again and letting yourself slide right back down.</p><p>\u00a0As you set a steady pace the room was soon filled with you moans and groans. Not too long after you sped up because of how close you were, and if the way Oberyn thrusted up into you was anything to go by he was close as well, he grabbed your hips and helped you ride him.</p><p>\u00a0The feeling of you cuming around him brought him over the edge causing him to bury himself as deep into you as he could before cuming himself. Panting you slid off Oberyn and snuggled into his side as he placed the covers over the two of you. </p><p>&ldquo;I love you (Y/N) and the child too.&rdquo; was the last thing you heard together with the feeling of a kiss being placed on your forehead before you fell asleep. </p><p><br/></p><h2><b>- the end -</b></h2>",

Well Bronn wasn\u2019t exactly what you would call a guard more likely one of few Tyrion\u2019s good friends who didn\u2019t judge him for being an imp. As the only real child of Robert Baratheon and Cersei Lannister (unlike Tommen, Myrcella and Joffrey) it was expected of you to welcome the prince of Dorne in Kingslanding.</p><p>\u00a0But unsurprisingly the prince went straight to the most popular brothel in the city instead of waiting for you and Tyrion to welcome him. There were rumors of the prince\u2019s appetite in both men and women alike but you didn\u2019t expect him to practically ignore you both.</p><p>\u00a0You made your way into the room where prince Oberyn was supposed to be, only to be greeted with the sight of the prince\u2019s dagger being stabbed through a lannister guard\u2019s hand. The gasp that escaped past your lips made prince Oberyn retract his weapon and turn to face the intruders as the other guard took his friend to the closest maester.\u00a0</p><p>Seeing the prince in his full glory you couldn\u2019t help but admit that the rumors of his good looks were most certainly true. Dark hair which you wanted to run your fingers through so badly, piercing onyx eyes that seemed to be looking into your very soul and his lean muscular chest revealed thanks to his exotic choice of clothing.</p><p>\u00a0Prince Oberyn looked at all of you only letting his gaze linger on a bit longer on you. Out of nowhere a dornish looking woman ran to him and pulled him into a lustful and passionate kiss.</p><p>\u201cEllaria Sand, my paramour.\u201d the prince introduced his lover with a certain amount of pride in his silky smooth voice. No wonder he was so proud to call her his, she was a very beautiful woman.</p><p>\u00a0Dark hair which reached all the way to her waist, olive-like skin with as nearly dark eyes as the prince\u2019s but what added to her beauty the most were probably her high cheekbones that gave her a natural look of elegance. </p><p>\u201cTyrion Lannister, the lord Tywin\u2019s own imp. And who may this beautiful lady be?\u201d the prince asked as he pulled away from Ellaria and gazed at you which resulted in his lover sending you a wink over his shoulder with a seductive smile. If the prince knew, he didn\u2019t show it and instead made his way towards you. </p><p>\u201cMy niece, (Y/N) of house Baratheon.\u201d Tyrion spoke uncertainly since he assumed the prince would know of the famous princess. Word has gone all over Westeros about the only dark haired daughter of King Robert Baratheon (rest in peace Robbie :D).</p><p>\u00a0Oberyn\u2019s eyes seemed to light up with a sense of mischief and adoration for the dark haired girl in front of him. He brought your hand to his lips and placed a delicate kiss to your knuckles. </p><p>\u201cMy lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrince Oberyn.\u201d you curtsied making the prince smirk. </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think it is a little inappropriate to leave without informing anyone about it, only to be found in a brothel of all places?\u201d you questioned the tanned prince with a smirk of your own and a hint of amusement in your eyes. This made the prince laugh and turn to Tyrion once again, saying.</p><p>\u201cIt seems like the lady has been spending way too much time with you. Smart and witty just like you lord Tyrion. A rare combination in a woman.\u201d Oberyn stated as he poured himself some wine. </p><p>\u201cWould you like to sit?\u201d he asked (Y/N) gesturing to the now empty bed before sitting on the end himself. </p><p>\u201cI think we need to talk, my prince.\u201d Tyrion said with a raised eyebrow when he saw his niece was about to take up on the prince\u2019s offer. </p><p>\u201cOf course, talk.\u201d Oberyn said while taking a sip of his wine and smiling at you. </p><p>\u201cAlone.\u201d Tyrion said sternly not liking what was going on between his niece and the Red Viper of Dorne. Oberyn let out an annoyed sight but nodded. You quickly made your way towards Ellaria and linked your arms together before leading her out of the brothel. </p><p><i>- time skip -</i></p><p>Over the next few days you spent most of your time with Oberyn and Ellaria to your family\u2019s utter dismay. Sometimes you asked them about Dorne and what it was like there, other times you and Oberyn would train your fighting skills together, the prince with his spear and you with your daggers or bow and arrows.</p><p>\u00a0Ellaria would always teach you about what other women in Dorne wore until you pretty much begged Oberyn to promise you that once they were to return they would take you with them. Spending more and more time with the Dornish duo somehow resulted in not only Ellaria being Oberyn\u2019s paramour but now you as well. The three of you shared each other, spent passionate nights together and loved each other. This night was different.</p><p>\u00a0You layed with your head on Oberyn\u2019s chest and traced invisible patterns on his skin as you layed in his bed once again. This time however, without Ellaria as she excused herself because of exhaustion. </p><p>\u201cIs something wrong, my love?\u201d Oberyn\u2019s voice sounded through the room. Of course he would notice, after all he knew you better than your own mother. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m scared Oberyn. I-i think I\u2019m with a child.\u201d you said as you pulled away to look at him. Seeing how his face lit up at your news you frowned, he opened his mouth to say something but you cut him off. </p><p>\u201cAnd don\u2019t you dare to say that it\u2019s amazing because it\u2019s not!\u201d you exclaimed as the tears started to build and threatened to escape your eyes. </p><p>\u201cWhat are you saying? Of course it\u2019s amazing.\u201d Oberyn\u2019s eyes showed nothing but confusion as he sat up too. </p><p>\u201cNo! Do you know what my mother will do if she finds out? Seven hells, we are not even married Oberyn!\u201d you sobbed as he pulled you into a hug, trying to calm you down he said.</p><p>\u201cWell, then it\u2019s probably good that I asked your mother for your hand in marriage, don\u2019t you think my love?\u201d you pulled away and stared at him in disbelief before crashing your lips on his and snaking your arms around his neck. Oberyn kissed you back, his arms finding their way to your waist and lifting you up just to place you on his naked lap as he leaned back into the pillows.</p><p>\u00a0Kissing down his neck you rolled your hips grinding into him.
