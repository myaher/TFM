Though almost everyone in your school thought he was just being snobby when he was just so shy.<br/></li><li>And of course, you developed a crush on him even before you had talked to him at all,\u00a0because\u00a0typical crush<b>\u2122</b>.<br/></li><li>Eventually, you befriended Peter at the middle of high school \u2013 and you were the only friend he had for some time.<br/></li><li>You were the first person who found out him having Spider-Man\u00a0powers,\u00a0because he accidentally kept blurting webs from his wrists from time to time, since he couldn\u2019t control it fully at first.<br/></li><li>And you had to reassure him for the whole day because of\u00a0it,\u00a0because he was sure you would abandon him and think he was a freak.<br/></li><li>And you\u00a0<i>maybe</i>\u00a0ended up cuddling on the sofa as you were reassuring him\u2026<br/></li><li>And he\u00a0<i>maybe</i>\u00a0kissed you for the first time that night\u2026<br/></li><li>A week after that night, he was extremely nervous about it, but he finally asked you to go\u00a0on\u00a0a date with him.<br/></li><li>After a few dates and spectacular food (minus those dumplings) you officially started dating.<br/></li><li>After Peter told you he wanted to begin to help people as \u201cSpider-Man\u201d, you were tense at the thought at first, because you were sure Peter would come home in a coffin if he starts doing that.<br/></li><li>And fortunately, he listened to you and suggested training for a year (or he suggested two weeks, you insisted two years and you eventually came to a conclusion of one year) before going into action.<br/></li><li>You rented an old garage and built a training ground there.<br/></li><li>And as Peter trained, you sketched the very first Spider-Man costume for him.<br/></li><li>And on his spare time when not training, he built web shooters and such to himself and sometimes he made nice comments about your costume sketches.<br/></li><li>He had to get rid of his fear of heights for the very last occasion for his training. You challenged him to climb to the very top of the Empire State Building. And after days and days of persuading and eventually promising him a pizza on your account if he does it, he very reluctantly agreed to do it, but in his words, it was\u00a0<i>only</i>\u00a0because \u201cthat pizza card is unfair, you know?\u201d. And he <i>actually</i> did it, (though it took an hour) and sent you a pic while he was there.<br/></li><li>\u201cI did it, is the pizza coming? I\u2019m starving!\u201d he had written as the text with the picture.<br/></li><li>And when he first went out to test his powers, people thought it was an advertisement for a circus which was coming to town later that week. Everyone was taking pictures as Peter was just swinging there and he\u00a0<i>enjoyed</i>\u00a0the attention. That was something you had never seen him enjoy. He made some funny jokes while there \u2013 and that was the other thing he had changed on.<br/></li><li>And even though Peter had changed a lot in a year, and you had fallen in love with a shy and nerdy boy, you now had\u00a0fun\u00a0and a lot bolder boyfriend. But you loved him nevertheless.<br/></li><li>He soon helped the world in two ways \u2013 he worked as a lab assistant for Otto Octavius, who had a project of making hi-tech limb prosthetics for disabled people and other times, he was swinging by his web and stopping crimes all around the city. You helped people by doing voluntary work at F.E.A.S.T.<br/></li><li>And btw, Peter\u2019s aunt loved you being together too. She said you did good to Peter and said she trusted you to not let Peter get in real trouble. She didn\u2019t say what she meant by that but\u2026 you believed you knew.</li></ul>",
