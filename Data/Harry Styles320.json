You knew, that you are the worst person alive and now, you were losing a treasure. Your tears were unstoppable, and your pain was unbelievable. </p><p>&ldquo;Stay with me, please.&rdquo; You begged weakly through your sobs, weaker than you ever thought you&rsquo;d be one day. </p><p>&ldquo;If I knew you&rsquo;d leave this way, the I would never leave you, I would never say any painful words to you, but if only I knew. Why are you leaving quickly? You have a very long lifetime to live. Just don&rsquo;t- don&rsquo;t go!&rdquo; You begged while you continued crying. </p><p>You were getting weaker and weaker every second. You were barely breathing cause the air suddenly got thicker, and it barely gets in and out your lungs. Words barely leaving your mouth and your tears falling hard from your red eyes. Your hope disappeared to be dust. Thinking, how your life is gonna be without him?</p><p>Then suddenly, his body began to shake weirdly, his heartbeats went insane, they were going fast then slow, everything went wrong within a second. You quickly ran out calling a doctor, you have never been afraid more than now.</p><p><b><i>I hope you enjoyed :). 10 notes for the coming update?</i></b></p>",
