But with TJ, he seems \nto be at a loss for words. When they get paired up for a summer \nassignment, Cyrus slowly starts to build a new dictionary. One that \ninvolves TJ and everything they do together. Along the way, maybe he\u2019ll \nfind the words to tell him how he feels.</p><p><b>Chapter 12: </b>Kalon<br/></p><p><b>Word Count: </b>2571</p><p><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/16756639/chapters/41046650\"><i>Read on AO3</i></a></p><hr><p>Light poured into the tree house the next morning through all the leaves. Patches of warm, golden sunlight patterned the boys. A strip of light fell across Cyrus\u2019 face, causing him to stir a little and out stretch his limbs. He hit something, or rather someone, and was a little startled to note TJ was there with him. He blinked his eyes a few times, remembering the events of last night. Smiling to himself, he rested on his arm, looking at TJ, who was still sleeping.</p><p>Up close he was able to see all his freckles; a small collection by his ear, a few on his right cheek, and a smatter of them across his nose. His glasses had slid off during the night, seeing at they were a few feet away from him. His hair that was normally neatly combed back was sticking out in all different directions, some of it coming down and hiding some of his forehead. His long lashes brushed his skin ever so lightly, the stark contrast of the dark lashes against his fair skin evident in the light. His nose, a little upturned, blowing out soft puffs of air as he slept. It was really cute.</p><p>Wait. No. Not cute. It wasn\u2019t cute.</p><!-- more --><p>Cyrus tried to shake that possibility out of his head, but it didn\u2019t want to leave. The word cute seemed to now be permanently ingrained in his brain. He felt his heart hitting his ribcage, feeling like he was going to break his bones, it was beating so hard. He scrambled off of TJ, pushing his arm hard enough to wake him up, stretching his arms up towards one edge of the tree house.</p><p>\u201cSorry, I-I didn\u2019t mean to wake you,\u201d Cyrus stammered, rubbing the back of his neck, \u201cI-I just realized that I have to get my stuff from Andi\u2019s house,\u201d he lied. Okay, well it wasn\u2019t a complete lie.</p><p>TJ rubbed his eyes, reaching and grabbing his glasses. \u201cOh, okay. Do you wanna get some breakfast? I can m-\u201d</p><p>\u201c-no, that\u2019s fine,\u201d Cyrus cut in quickly, scrambling to his feet, \u201cI\u2019m not huge on breakfast,\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou inhale pancakes like a vacuum,\u201d TJ mumbled, propping himself up on his elbows.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not hungry,\u201d he lied again, \u201cI\u2019ll see you later,\u201d he mumbled, climbing down the first few rungs of the ladder and jumping onto the ground. He started running towards Andi\u2019s house, leaving behind a very confused and slightly hurt TJ.</p><hr><p>TJ shut the door, rubbing his eyes as he strolled into the kitchen. \u201cMorning,\u201d he mumbled, seeing Amber already making breakfast, \u201cpancakes?\u201d</p><p>Amber nodded, flipping one over with a satisfying sizzle. \u201cWhy were you outside?\u201d she asked, setting the spatula aside, \u201cgo for an early morning run?\u201d</p><p>TJ shook his head, grabbing a pancake off the top of the stack and taking a bite out of it. \u201cCyrus came by last night at around two in the morning. Said he couldn\u2019t sleep,\u201d he explained as he chewed, \u201cso we went up in the tree house and talked and then we fell asleep,\u201d</p><p>Amber shook her head, ladling another spoonful of batter onto the griddle. \u201cWhy are you guys actually dating,\u201d she mused, a smile dancing on her lips.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not,\u201d he groaned, \u201che left this morning in a hurry, like he just didn\u2019t want to be around me,\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know that\u2019s so far from the truth,\u201d Amber reminded him, \u201cCyrus really cares about you, and loves spending time with you. I\u2019m more mature so I should know,\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould but shorn\u2019t,\u201d TJ mumbled, grabbing another pancake and heading upstairs.</p><hr><p>Cyrus paced outside Jonah\u2019s door, waiting for it to open. What if he didn\u2019t answer? What if he thought something was seriously wrong and didn\u2019t want to be bothered by him? Ah, the many thoughts of an anxiety-ridden teenager.</p><p>\u201cCy, what\u2019s up?\u201d Jonah greeted him, ushering him inside.</p><p>\u201cWe have a problem,\u201d Cyrus groaned, slipping off his shoes and taking a seat on the couch. He pulled his knees into his chest, wrapping his arms around his legs.</p><p>\u201cCare to explain?\u201d Jonah asked, grabbing some pretzels from the kitchen and pouring them into a bowl. He set them down on the table and took a seat by Cyrus.</p><p>\u201cI hate emotions. They\u2019re too confusing,\u201d he mumbled, taking a pretzel and nibbling on it like a squirrel.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re telling me,\u201d Jonah chuckled, \u201cwhat\u2019s this about?\u201d</p><p><i>And here we go</i>, Cyrus thought to himself. He knew exactly what it was about, but he didn\u2019t want to say it out loud. Because saying it out loud would make it real. And that scared him</p><p>\u201cTJ,\u201d he said, voice barely above a whisper. He honestly hoped that Jonah didn\u2019t hear him over the crunching of his pretzels, but given his shift in expression, he probably did.</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Jonah smirked, setting the pretzels aside and batting his lashes, \u201ctell me everything,\u201d</p><p>Cyrus shoved him gently; was it really that obvious? \u201cI think I have a small crush on TJ and I don\u2019t want to talk about it,\u201d he stated, his cheeks turning a shade pinker at the mention of TJ. Now he remembered why he hated having crushes so much.</p><p>\u201cSmall?\u201d Jonah challenged, raising his brows.</p><p>\u201cFine, not so small. Leave me alone,\u201d he pouted, putting his head between his knees.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re here because&hellip;?\u201d Jonah trailed.</p><p>Cyrus sighed, bringing his head up slightly. \u201cSorry. I don\u2019t mean to take this out on you,\u201d he apologized, \u201cI just&hellip;don\u2019t know who else to come to about this,\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t think to go to Andi or Buffy?\u201d Jonah asked.</p><p>Cyrus shook his head, wincing at the very idea. \u201cThey already think we should be dating. If I told them that I liked him, they\u2019d go berserk and probably tell him,\u201d</p><p>Jonah nodded, seeming to understand. \u201cSo, what are you gonna do? About the TJ thing,\u201d</p><p>Cyrus looked at him like he\u2019d just suggested to commit a murder. \u201cDo? Nothing. Just sit and pine hopelessly until this crush thing blows over,\u201d he supplied. <i>Just like I did with you.</i></p><p>\u201cLook,\u201d Jonah hesitated, \u201cI know I can be oblivious, but like&hellip;you gotta admit,\u201d</p><p>Cyrus let out another groan, putting his hands over his face. \u201cNot you too,\u201d he whined.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Jonah mumbled, running his fingers down the groove of the couch.</p><p>Cyrus waved him off, offering a sympathetic smile. \u201cIt\u2019s fine. It\u2019s just&hellip;complicated. He\u2019s my best friend, and I don\u2019t wanna ruin things between us,\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll try not to feel too hurt that he\u2019s your <i>best </i>friend,\u201d Jonah chuckled, \u201cIf he\u2019s really your best friend, and he doesn\u2019t return feelings, things will still be okay between you guys. I promise,\u201d he assured Cyrus, \u201cI mean, we\u2019re still friends,\u201d</p><p>Cyrus quirked a brow. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Jonah laughed, putting a hand on Cyrus\u2019 shoulder. \u201cYou think I didn\u2019t know you had a crush on me?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus was stunned, to say the least. Jonah Oblivious Beck knew that he had a crush on him. \u201cDid Buffy tell you? Andi?\u201d</p><p>Jonah shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m not blind, dude. I didn\u2019t wanna tell you until you were over it so I didn\u2019t freak you out,\u201d he explained, \u201cand if you wanted to tell me, things weren\u2019t gonna change, you know,\u201d</p><p>Cyrus felt like he was going to faint, or worse, start crying. \u201cOh,\u201d is the only thing he said, embarrassed beyond words.</p><p>\u201cSeriously, don\u2019t worry about it. You\u2019re over it, I\u2019m with Walker and you\u2019re&hellip;basically with TJ,\u201d he chuckled.</p><p>Cyrus rolled his eyes. \u201cIf by basically you mean basically friends, then yeah, sure,\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever you say,\u201d Jonah said, shaking his head.</p><hr><p>\u201cChocolate is the best of all flavors,\u201d Amber argued, looking to Walker, \u201cback me up on this?\u201d</p><p>Walker looked between the girls, Amber with chocolate ice cream and Andi with strawberry. Andi gave him a knowing look, bringing up a finger and dragging it across her throat.</p><p>\u201cYou know, best is a strong word,\u201d he dodged the question, returning to his mint-chocolate, \u201cI don\u2019t think there really is a best,\u201d</p><p>Andi rolled her eyes. \u201cI could be ten dollars richer here,\u201d she mumbled, taking a bite out of her ice cream.</p><p>\u201cIf I say chocolate, will you split the money with me?\u201d Walker asked, earning a glare from Amber.</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t supposed to tell him,\u201d she pouted, \u201cthat\u2019s not fair,\u201d</p><p>Andi shrugged, getting some of the chocolate ice cream around her mouth and on her nose. \u201cLife\u2019s fair because it\u2019s unfair to everyone.\u201d she mused.</p><p>Amber sighed, finishing off her ice cream and grabbing a napkin. \u201cYou need it,\u201d she noted, reaching over and wiping the other girl\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Andi mumbled, finishing off her ice cream and reaching into her pocket, \u201chere, this is for you,\u201d she said. Andi pulled out the bracelet, showing it to Amber who instantly took it into her hands.</p><p>\u201cAfter the last debacle of the bracelets, you made me one?\u201d she said, although it came out more like a question. Her fingers gingerly brushed over the intricate weaving, holding the delicate tassels in her hands.</p><p>\u201cThis one\u2019s different. I\u2019m sure of it,\u201d she assured her, taking the bracelet back and tying it around Amber\u2019s wrist.</p><p>\u201cYou guys do make a cute couple,\u201d Walker cut in, smiling.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re trying to get back on my good side, it\u2019s not working,\u201d Amber chuckled, tossing the napkin in the trash.</p><p>\u201cIf I\u2019m being honest, mint-chip is the best,\u201d</p><p>Both girls turned towards him, bewildered expressions on their faces. \u201cWalker!\u201d</p><hr><p><i>6/27</i></p><p><i>Today I talked to jonah about me and TJ. I think that I\u2019m starting to have a small crush on him. Okay, that\u2019s a lie, it\u2019s a normal crush&hellip;fine, a big crush. I have a crush on my best friend and I don\u2019t know what to do about it. Obviously I\u2019m not blind, I can see that TJ\u2019s objectively attractive, but it\u2019s so much more than that. He\u2019s so kind, and thoughtful, and radiates so much confidence that it\u2019s infectious. His beauty is far more than skin deep.</i></p><p>He paused, taking out his phone and googling his last phrase.</p><p><i>beauty that is more than skin deep</i></p><p>The word popped up underneath, and Cyrus flipped to the back of his journal to jot it down.</p><p><i>kalon: beauty that is more than skin deep</i></p><p>Returning back to the journal entry, he tapped his pen against the paper, unsure of what else to write. Nothing was coming to him; for once, he was at a loss for words. Setting his journal aside, he grabbed his phone and opened another tab.</p><p><i>search: i think i like my best friend</i></p><p><i>search: what to do if i have a crush on my best friend</i></p><p><i>search: my best friend and i are gay and i think i like him</i></p><p><i>search: how to get over a crush on your best friend</i></p><p><i>search: do i like my best friend quiz</i></p><p><i>search: does he like me or does he just want to be friends quiz</i></p><p>After what felt like hours scouring the internet, Cyrus felt like he was still nowhere. All the sites and quizzes said that it was possible that TJ could like him, but there was still that hint of uncertainty. And that was precisely what was holding him back. That little thread of insecurity, the soft but persistent \u2018what if\u2019 lingering in the back of his mind.</p><p>\u201cI like TJ,\u201d he whispered to himself. It felt &hellip; all the more real now that he\u2019d finally said it. Because now it existed not only as a part of his mind, but outside of his mind. It was out there; and that scared him more than anything.</p><hr><p><i>6/27</i></p><p><i>I don\u2019t know what to do about Buffy. I think ever since this \u2018I love you\u2019 thing, things have been weird between us. I feel like we can\u2019t hang out like usual, and I miss that. I miss all the little things that came with being us, being Buffy and Marty. Randomly racing each other to the end of the streets. Seeing who could make the best grilled cheese. Who could go the longest without crying at a movie. I miss everything. Do we need a break? Are we better off as friends?</i></p><p>Marty let out a frustrated breath, and shut his journal, tossing it onto his desk. Grabbing his pair of sneakers from under his desk, he came down the stairs and headed outside. He started running, trying to clear his head, turning left and not stopping until he collided with someone and was on the ground.</p><p>\u201cWatch it,\u201d came the other voice, and Marty thought he had really hit his head hard.</p><p>\u201cBuffy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarty?\u201d</p><p>The two of them stared at each other; Buffy also sported sneakers and athletic wear. Evidently, she was also going for a run.</p><p>\u201cUm&hellip;hi,\u201d he managed, regaining his sense of breath.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d she said, helping him to his feet, \u201cyou okay?\u201d</p><p>Marty nodded, knowing fully he was lying. \u201cI-uh, yeah, yeah totally. I\u2019m totally and completely&hellip;fine,\u201d he cracked, blowing out a puff of air.</p><p>\u201cMarty,\u201d Buffy said softly, putting a hand on his shoulder, \u201cjust&hellip;say what\u2019s on your mind,\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know about&hellip;us,\u201d he whispered after a pause, gesturing vaguely.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean I said I loved you, for fuck\u2019s sake,\u201d he grumbled, screwing his eyes tight and willing himself not to cry, \u201cdoesn\u2019t that&hellip;freak you out a little?\u201d</p><p>Buffy hesitated, her hand lingering on his shoulder. \u201cI mean&hellip;I was a little surprised, but I still like you a lot, Marty. I\u2019m just not sure about love. I don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like,\u201d she admitted, knitting her hands together.</p><p>Marty kept his head down; he knew the moment he met her eyes he would start crying, and he was not about to do that. \u201cI get it,\u201d he deadpanned. He wondered if biology could explain this pain he felt in his chest; he was fairly certain it wasn\u2019t from the writing.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re still us, right? Buffy and Marty?\u201d Buffy asked, linking her pinky with Marty\u2019s.</p><p>Marty nodded, smiling weakly. \u201cYeah. Still us,\u201d</p><p>Buffy unlinked their pinkies and pulled him in for a hug. She could feel him nearly collapse underneath him, and she didn\u2019t pull away. She felt more out of breath than she did when she was running, and worried that her heart was pounding so hard that she was going to bruise Marty\u2019s ribcage. It was a surge of emotions she hadn\u2019t felt before, and that scared her.</p><p>Marty pulled back, giving her a nod before taking off for the rest of his run, a little bruised from the fall. Buffy stood there, frozen, watching as her boyfriend shrunk in the distance. She put a hand over her heart, feeling it flutter. Her chest ached with a sense of longing; she wanted nothing more right now than to be with Marty. Sitting with him, holding his hand, watching a movie, peppering him with kisses whenever it got boring&hellip;</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d she muttered under her breath, turning on her heel to go home, \u201cshit, shit, shit,\u201d she whispered, shaking her head as if it could get rid of this feeling. This strange feeling that she\u2019d never felt before. It felt eerily similar to&hellip;no. She wasn\u2019t going to say it; she didn\u2019t even want to say it. Once she said it, it was like the paint drying; permanent, and couldn\u2019t be undone.</p><p><i>Great.</i></p><hr><p>Tag List: \n<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m7R6p_iU9G8Gh8chz1LUkOg\">@shortstackofpeaches || @seanna313</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mB_fjwbYnt6KH-iEEVWn8ig\">@geekingbeautytx</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mx3fTvftLAxW_PMMErDl_UA\">@heavenlybyers ||</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mr1BeThlMP6lSNdCv9_u98w\">@ginnychrises</a>|| <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mq4Fz3LkzWjZC-KqvwLI2IQ\">@wlwandimack</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mlcQ2RsNl23FLSXFuHW7LHA\">@giocondasstuff</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjInWsj0ClAwVBAeG3vRcVw\">@lemonboytyrus</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mNwMw7enpLkLc8PJbIgqIpA\">@adorejrizzle</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mqsacC6O0CwDxqCVXhKqKMg\">@swingsetboys</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m5HZenndZxervK_R1eUWPgA\">@ifellintotyrushell</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mlmDXY_IPGUhgMI0icEk5Fw\">@idk-dude-17</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/md3vq8Jj9kFqSljYsARejoQ\">@rbf-lesbian</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/miY4DTLwRG38LWUEXGrwqQQ\">@marianara-sauce</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mweSXXIeqHwnjzlxWq9XUDw\">@kaptainjinxz</a> || @<a href=\"http://alex-poster-pizz.tumblr.com\">alex-poster-pizz || </a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mPGweOqhfiAqow-tS0I2R6Q\">@quietmarvel</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mdvU81fYq0CNQvV5m2taDGQ\">@blueberry-my-hero-macadamia</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mcbji5TcL-VC-WOCJVAbpjw\">@broadwayitbitch</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mIrWwvtK767VFgc84SQnSmw\">@tjsmuffin</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mNxJK8EhlLcuAxp-Fy8ZbFA\">@tjthekippen</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mD5xwG2u8vIh_s73zuIGl0g\">@idpleasesir</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m7fdykeIYkcOXPu3bLUwexA\">@hi-hello-hey-there</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/miDxY6dUJGULGFxiGQ40Vzw\">@bingewatchingenthusiast</a>|| <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_McecsKdTsnfdqnR2ozw1A\">@booklove-2</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m3KYGYYNAKvqZ_XVFoSWXCg\">@illbeyourreasonwhy</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mEx0042yZEiHRJ3jMqTs-rA\">@birdiesandflowers</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m8CXsQC7iejVYW39YZtzCUg\">@whistlepunk</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m9sonAr6Kx-g7fLYWOoIENQ\">@phinallyjackie</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrTO_xWDLkyEgi4LFyByJMQ\">@thedampjofangirl</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mxUprLHny1HYleRX2Qz3B-Q\">@tyrus4eva</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mDtn4v-rJcfP7a0m51rQAIA\">@tj-is-a-lemony-boy</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mAvcCAzWMuhg5NFzViiC1Uw\">@tj-goodman-bittersweet-boy</a> || @dis-app-oin-tme-nt || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m6_PSslGMLadBwFf51HMVMw\">@nessarinthegay</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m2S891zBEolQhmvw94WEEpA\">@breadisticks</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYctS-TJVaIxMIM1KPeVP1A\">@typewriter-riz</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mpDM4OrcSo5OknyNg-7VgWg\">@gobletofash</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mgjuE9tqgzdBFlw3OUmAPYg\">@bluemuffinboy</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/myeSqX7QQrz4q4ZteKbmoCg\">@sofuuh</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mKemMX29wu_Y_MCi69LuIMQ\">@cheesystars</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfAL43lCQk6VEqq6AxC6GeQ\">@tjmuffin</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m-26HuYTBll7Hj1BqcsOZPA\">@multifandom-bxitch</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/muYk4KP0O5cWwKw3iozZ6nA\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/muYk4KP0O5cWwKw3iozZ6nA\">@allylovessadie</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mCc7FcCPMxCd8PrWuydEr4w\">@hithatsmyname</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mFA7rW6-u7x3w8VNCK_KD7A\">@tyrusinarush</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mFMeKUhkzTWE7ubZ8HduqJA\">@tyrus-lookback</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mhwpAw_kQmNajYckySCFqAg\">@gaycefulwords</a> ||\n\n<br/><i></i></p>",

His long lashes brushed his skin ever so lightly, the stark contrast of the dark lashes against his fair skin evident in the light.

But with TJ, he seems \nto be at a loss for words. When they get paired up for a summer \nassignment, Cyrus slowly starts to build a new dictionary. One that \ninvolves TJ and everything they do together. Along the way, maybe he\u2019ll \nfind the words to tell him how he feels.</p><p><b>Chapter 12: </b>Kalon<br></p><p><b>Word Count: </b>2571</p><p><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/16756639/chapters/41046650\"><i>Read on AO3</i></a></p><hr><p>Light poured into the tree house the next morning through all the leaves. Patches of warm, golden sunlight patterned the boys. A strip of light fell across Cyrus\u2019 face, causing him to stir a little and out stretch his limbs. He hit something, or rather someone, and was a little startled to note TJ was there with him. He blinked his eyes a few times, remembering the events of last night. Smiling to himself, he rested on his arm, looking at TJ, who was still sleeping.</p><p>Up close he was able to see all his freckles; a small collection by his ear, a few on his right cheek, and a smatter of them across his nose. His glasses had slid off during the night, seeing at they were a few feet away from him. His hair that was normally neatly combed back was sticking out in all different directions, some of it coming down and hiding some of his forehead. His long lashes brushed his skin ever so lightly, the stark contrast of the dark lashes against his fair skin evident in the light. His nose, a little upturned, blowing out soft puffs of air as he slept. It was really cute.</p><p>Wait. No. Not cute. It wasn\u2019t cute.</p>[[MORE]]<p>Cyrus tried to shake that possibility out of his head, but it didn\u2019t want to leave. The word cute seemed to now be permanently ingrained in his brain. He felt his heart hitting his ribcage, feeling like he was going to break his bones, it was beating so hard. He scrambled off of TJ, pushing his arm hard enough to wake him up, stretching his arms up towards one edge of the tree house.</p><p>\u201cSorry, I-I didn\u2019t mean to wake you,\u201d Cyrus stammered, rubbing the back of his neck, \u201cI-I just realized that I have to get my stuff from Andi\u2019s house,\u201d he lied. Okay, well it wasn\u2019t a complete lie.</p><p>TJ rubbed his eyes, reaching and grabbing his glasses. \u201cOh, okay. Do you wanna get some breakfast? I can m-\u201d</p><p>\u201c-no, that\u2019s fine,\u201d Cyrus cut in quickly, scrambling to his feet, \u201cI\u2019m not huge on breakfast,\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou inhale pancakes like a vacuum,\u201d TJ mumbled, propping himself up on his elbows.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not hungry,\u201d he lied again, \u201cI\u2019ll see you later,\u201d he mumbled, climbing down the first few rungs of the ladder and jumping onto the ground. He started running towards Andi\u2019s house, leaving behind a very confused and slightly hurt TJ.</p><hr><p>TJ shut the door, rubbing his eyes as he strolled into the kitchen. \u201cMorning,\u201d he mumbled, seeing Amber already making breakfast, \u201cpancakes?\u201d</p><p>Amber nodded, flipping one over with a satisfying sizzle. \u201cWhy were you outside?\u201d she asked, setting the spatula aside, \u201cgo for an early morning run?\u201d</p><p>TJ shook his head, grabbing a pancake off the top of the stack and taking a bite out of it. \u201cCyrus came by last night at around two in the morning. Said he couldn\u2019t sleep,\u201d he explained as he chewed, \u201cso we went up in the tree house and talked and then we fell asleep,\u201d</p><p>Amber shook her head, ladling another spoonful of batter onto the griddle. \u201cWhy are you guys actually dating,\u201d she mused, a smile dancing on her lips.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not,\u201d he groaned, \u201che left this morning in a hurry, like he just didn\u2019t want to be around me,\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know that\u2019s so far from the truth,\u201d Amber reminded him, \u201cCyrus really cares about you, and loves spending time with you. I\u2019m more mature so I should know,\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould but shorn\u2019t,\u201d TJ mumbled, grabbing another pancake and heading upstairs.</p><hr><p>Cyrus paced outside Jonah\u2019s door, waiting for it to open. What if he didn\u2019t answer? What if he thought something was seriously wrong and didn\u2019t want to be bothered by him? Ah, the many thoughts of an anxiety-ridden teenager.</p><p>\u201cCy, what\u2019s up?\u201d Jonah greeted him, ushering him inside.</p><p>\u201cWe have a problem,\u201d Cyrus groaned, slipping off his shoes and taking a seat on the couch. He pulled his knees into his chest, wrapping his arms around his legs.</p><p>\u201cCare to explain?\u201d Jonah asked, grabbing some pretzels from the kitchen and pouring them into a bowl. He set them down on the table and took a seat by Cyrus.</p><p>\u201cI hate emotions. They\u2019re too confusing,\u201d he mumbled, taking a pretzel and nibbling on it like a squirrel.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re telling me,\u201d Jonah chuckled, \u201cwhat\u2019s this about?\u201d</p><p><i>And here we go</i>, Cyrus thought to himself. He knew exactly what it was about, but he didn\u2019t want to say it out loud. Because saying it out loud would make it real. And that scared him</p><p>\u201cTJ,\u201d he said, voice barely above a whisper. He honestly hoped that Jonah didn\u2019t hear him over the crunching of his pretzels, but given his shift in expression, he probably did.</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Jonah smirked, setting the pretzels aside and batting his lashes, \u201ctell me everything,\u201d</p><p>Cyrus shoved him gently; was it really that obvious? \u201cI think I have a small crush on TJ and I don\u2019t want to talk about it,\u201d he stated, his cheeks turning a shade pinker at the mention of TJ. Now he remembered why he hated having crushes so much.</p><p>\u201cSmall?\u201d Jonah challenged, raising his brows.</p><p>\u201cFine, not so small. Leave me alone,\u201d he pouted, putting his head between his knees.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re here because\u2026?\u201d Jonah trailed.</p><p>Cyrus sighed, bringing his head up slightly. \u201cSorry. I don\u2019t mean to take this out on you,\u201d he apologized, \u201cI just\u2026don\u2019t know who else to come to about this,\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t think to go to Andi or Buffy?\u201d Jonah asked.</p><p>Cyrus shook his head, wincing at the very idea. \u201cThey already think we should be dating. If I told them that I liked him, they\u2019d go berserk and probably tell him,\u201d</p><p>Jonah nodded, seeming to understand. \u201cSo, what are you gonna do? About the TJ thing,\u201d</p><p>Cyrus looked at him like he\u2019d just suggested to commit a murder. \u201cDo? Nothing. Just sit and pine hopelessly until this crush thing blows over,\u201d he supplied. <i>Just like I did with you.</i></p><p>\u201cLook,\u201d Jonah hesitated, \u201cI know I can be oblivious, but like\u2026you gotta admit,\u201d</p><p>Cyrus let out another groan, putting his hands over his face. \u201cNot you too,\u201d he whined.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Jonah mumbled, running his fingers down the groove of the couch.</p><p>Cyrus waved him off, offering a sympathetic smile. \u201cIt\u2019s fine. It\u2019s just\u2026complicated. He\u2019s my best friend, and I don\u2019t wanna ruin things between us,\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll try not to feel too hurt that he\u2019s your <i>best </i>friend,\u201d Jonah chuckled, \u201cIf he\u2019s really your best friend, and he doesn\u2019t return feelings, things will still be okay between you guys. I promise,\u201d he assured Cyrus, \u201cI mean, we\u2019re still friends,\u201d</p><p>Cyrus quirked a brow. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Jonah laughed, putting a hand on Cyrus\u2019 shoulder. \u201cYou think I didn\u2019t know you had a crush on me?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus was stunned, to say the least. Jonah Oblivious Beck knew that he had a crush on him. \u201cDid Buffy tell you? Andi?\u201d</p><p>Jonah shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m not blind, dude. I didn\u2019t wanna tell you until you were over it so I didn\u2019t freak you out,\u201d he explained, \u201cand if you wanted to tell me, things weren\u2019t gonna change, you know,\u201d</p><p>Cyrus felt like he was going to faint, or worse, start crying. \u201cOh,\u201d is the only thing he said, embarrassed beyond words.</p><p>\u201cSeriously, don\u2019t worry about it. You\u2019re over it, I\u2019m with Walker and you\u2019re\u2026basically with TJ,\u201d he chuckled.</p><p>Cyrus rolled his eyes. \u201cIf by basically you mean basically friends, then yeah, sure,\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever you say,\u201d Jonah said, shaking his head.</p><hr><p>\u201cChocolate is the best of all flavors,\u201d Amber argued, looking to Walker, \u201cback me up on this?\u201d</p><p>Walker looked between the girls, Amber with chocolate ice cream and Andi with strawberry. Andi gave him a knowing look, bringing up a finger and dragging it across her throat.</p><p>\u201cYou know, best is a strong word,\u201d he dodged the question, returning to his mint-chocolate, \u201cI don\u2019t think there really is a best,\u201d</p><p>Andi rolled her eyes. \u201cI could be ten dollars richer here,\u201d she mumbled, taking a bite out of her ice cream.</p><p>\u201cIf I say chocolate, will you split the money with me?\u201d Walker asked, earning a glare from Amber.</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t supposed to tell him,\u201d she pouted, \u201cthat\u2019s not fair,\u201d</p><p>Andi shrugged, getting some of the chocolate ice cream around her mouth and on her nose. \u201cLife\u2019s fair because it\u2019s unfair to everyone.\u201d she mused.</p><p>Amber sighed, finishing off her ice cream and grabbing a napkin. \u201cYou need it,\u201d she noted, reaching over and wiping the other girl\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Andi mumbled, finishing off her ice cream and reaching into her pocket, \u201chere, this is for you,\u201d she said. Andi pulled out the bracelet, showing it to Amber who instantly took it into her hands.</p><p>\u201cAfter the last debacle of the bracelets, you made me one?\u201d she said, although it came out more like a question. Her fingers gingerly brushed over the intricate weaving, holding the delicate tassels in her hands.</p><p>\u201cThis one\u2019s different. I\u2019m sure of it,\u201d she assured her, taking the bracelet back and tying it around Amber\u2019s wrist.</p><p>\u201cYou guys do make a cute couple,\u201d Walker cut in, smiling.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re trying to get back on my good side, it\u2019s not working,\u201d Amber chuckled, tossing the napkin in the trash.</p><p>\u201cIf I\u2019m being honest, mint-chip is the best,\u201d</p><p>Both girls turned towards him, bewildered expressions on their faces. \u201cWalker!\u201d</p><hr><p><i>6/27</i></p><p><i>Today I talked to jonah about me and TJ. I think that I\u2019m starting to have a small crush on him. Okay, that\u2019s a lie, it\u2019s a normal crush\u2026fine, a big crush. I have a crush on my best friend and I don\u2019t know what to do about it. Obviously I\u2019m not blind, I can see that TJ\u2019s objectively attractive, but it\u2019s so much more than that. He\u2019s so kind, and thoughtful, and radiates so much confidence that it\u2019s infectious. His beauty is far more than skin deep.</i></p><p>He paused, taking out his phone and googling his last phrase.</p><p><i>beauty that is more than skin deep</i></p><p>The word popped up underneath, and Cyrus flipped to the back of his journal to jot it down.</p><p><i>kalon: beauty that is more than skin deep</i></p><p>Returning back to the journal entry, he tapped his pen against the paper, unsure of what else to write. Nothing was coming to him; for once, he was at a loss for words. Setting his journal aside, he grabbed his phone and opened another tab.</p><p><i>search: i think i like my best friend</i></p><p><i>search: what to do if i have a crush on my best friend</i></p><p><i>search: my best friend and i are gay and i think i like him</i></p><p><i>search: how to get over a crush on your best friend</i></p><p><i>search: do i like my best friend quiz</i></p><p><i>search: does he like me or does he just want to be friends quiz</i></p><p>After what felt like hours scouring the internet, Cyrus felt like he was still nowhere. All the sites and quizzes said that it was possible that TJ could like him, but there was still that hint of uncertainty. And that was precisely what was holding him back. That little thread of insecurity, the soft but persistent \u2018what if\u2019 lingering in the back of his mind.</p><p>\u201cI like TJ,\u201d he whispered to himself. It felt \u2026 all the more real now that he\u2019d finally said it. Because now it existed not only as a part of his mind, but outside of his mind. It was out there; and that scared him more than anything.</p><hr><p><i>6/27</i></p><p><i>I don\u2019t know what to do about Buffy. I think ever since this \u2018I love you\u2019 thing, things have been weird between us. I feel like we can\u2019t hang out like usual, and I miss that. I miss all the little things that came with being us, being Buffy and Marty. Randomly racing each other to the end of the streets. Seeing who could make the best grilled cheese. Who could go the longest without crying at a movie. I miss everything. Do we need a break? Are we better off as friends?</i></p><p>Marty let out a frustrated breath, and shut his journal, tossing it onto his desk. Grabbing his pair of sneakers from under his desk, he came down the stairs and headed outside. He started running, trying to clear his head, turning left and not stopping until he collided with someone and was on the ground.</p><p>\u201cWatch it,\u201d came the other voice, and Marty thought he had really hit his head hard.</p><p>\u201cBuffy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarty?\u201d</p><p>The two of them stared at each other; Buffy also sported sneakers and athletic wear. Evidently, she was also going for a run.</p><p>\u201cUm\u2026hi,\u201d he managed, regaining his sense of breath.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d she said, helping him to his feet, \u201cyou okay?\u201d</p><p>Marty nodded, knowing fully he was lying. \u201cI-uh, yeah, yeah totally. I\u2019m totally and completely\u2026fine,\u201d he cracked, blowing out a puff of air.</p><p>\u201cMarty,\u201d Buffy said softly, putting a hand on his shoulder, \u201cjust\u2026say what\u2019s on your mind,\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know about\u2026us,\u201d he whispered after a pause, gesturing vaguely.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean I said I loved you, for fuck\u2019s sake,\u201d he grumbled, screwing his eyes tight and willing himself not to cry, \u201cdoesn\u2019t that\u2026freak you out a little?\u201d</p><p>Buffy hesitated, her hand lingering on his shoulder. \u201cI mean\u2026I was a little surprised, but I still like you a lot, Marty. I\u2019m just not sure about love. I don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like,\u201d she admitted, knitting her hands together.</p><p>Marty kept his head down; he knew the moment he met her eyes he would start crying, and he was not about to do that. \u201cI get it,\u201d he deadpanned. He wondered if biology could explain this pain he felt in his chest; he was fairly certain it wasn\u2019t from the writing.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re still us, right? Buffy and Marty?\u201d Buffy asked, linking her pinky with Marty\u2019s.</p><p>Marty nodded, smiling weakly. \u201cYeah. Still us,\u201d</p><p>Buffy unlinked their pinkies and pulled him in for a hug. She could feel him nearly collapse underneath him, and she didn\u2019t pull away. She felt more out of breath than she did when she was running, and worried that her heart was pounding so hard that she was going to bruise Marty\u2019s ribcage. It was a surge of emotions she hadn\u2019t felt before, and that scared her.</p><p>Marty pulled back, giving her a nod before taking off for the rest of his run, a little bruised from the fall. Buffy stood there, frozen, watching as her boyfriend shrunk in the distance. She put a hand over her heart, feeling it flutter. Her chest ached with a sense of longing; she wanted nothing more right now than to be with Marty. Sitting with him, holding his hand, watching a movie, peppering him with kisses whenever it got boring\u2026</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d she muttered under her breath, turning on her heel to go home, \u201cshit, shit, shit,\u201d she whispered, shaking her head as if it could get rid of this feeling. This strange feeling that she\u2019d never felt before. It felt eerily similar to\u2026no. She wasn\u2019t going to say it; she didn\u2019t even want to say it.

But with TJ, he seems \nto be at a loss for words. When they get paired up for a summer \nassignment, Cyrus slowly starts to build a new dictionary. One that \ninvolves TJ and everything they do together. Along the way, maybe he\u2019ll \nfind the words to tell him how he feels.</p><p><b>Chapter 12: </b>Kalon<br></p><p><b>Word Count: </b>2571</p><p><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/16756639/chapters/41046650\"><i>Read on AO3</i></a></p><hr><p>Light poured into the tree house the next morning through all the leaves. Patches of warm, golden sunlight patterned the boys. A strip of light fell across Cyrus\u2019 face, causing him to stir a little and out stretch his limbs. He hit something, or rather someone, and was a little startled to note TJ was there with him. He blinked his eyes a few times, remembering the events of last night. Smiling to himself, he rested on his arm, looking at TJ, who was still sleeping.</p><p>Up close he was able to see all his freckles; a small collection by his ear, a few on his right cheek, and a smatter of them across his nose. His glasses had slid off during the night, seeing at they were a few feet away from him. His hair that was normally neatly combed back was sticking out in all different directions, some of it coming down and hiding some of his forehead. His long lashes brushed his skin ever so lightly, the stark contrast of the dark lashes against his fair skin evident in the light. His nose, a little upturned, blowing out soft puffs of air as he slept. It was really cute.</p><p>Wait. No. Not cute. It wasn\u2019t cute.</p>[[MORE]]<p>Cyrus tried to shake that possibility out of his head, but it didn\u2019t want to leave. The word cute seemed to now be permanently ingrained in his brain. He felt his heart hitting his ribcage, feeling like he was going to break his bones, it was beating so hard. He scrambled off of TJ, pushing his arm hard enough to wake him up, stretching his arms up towards one edge of the tree house.</p><p>\u201cSorry, I-I didn\u2019t mean to wake you,\u201d Cyrus stammered, rubbing the back of his neck, \u201cI-I just realized that I have to get my stuff from Andi\u2019s house,\u201d he lied. Okay, well it wasn\u2019t a complete lie.</p><p>TJ rubbed his eyes, reaching and grabbing his glasses. \u201cOh, okay. Do you wanna get some breakfast? I can m-\u201d</p><p>\u201c-no, that\u2019s fine,\u201d Cyrus cut in quickly, scrambling to his feet, \u201cI\u2019m not huge on breakfast,\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou inhale pancakes like a vacuum,\u201d TJ mumbled, propping himself up on his elbows.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not hungry,\u201d he lied again, \u201cI\u2019ll see you later,\u201d he mumbled, climbing down the first few rungs of the ladder and jumping onto the ground. He started running towards Andi\u2019s house, leaving behind a very confused and slightly hurt TJ.</p><hr><p>TJ shut the door, rubbing his eyes as he strolled into the kitchen. \u201cMorning,\u201d he mumbled, seeing Amber already making breakfast, \u201cpancakes?\u201d</p><p>Amber nodded, flipping one over with a satisfying sizzle. \u201cWhy were you outside?\u201d she asked, setting the spatula aside, \u201cgo for an early morning run?\u201d</p><p>TJ shook his head, grabbing a pancake off the top of the stack and taking a bite out of it. \u201cCyrus came by last night at around two in the morning. Said he couldn\u2019t sleep,\u201d he explained as he chewed, \u201cso we went up in the tree house and talked and then we fell asleep,\u201d</p><p>Amber shook her head, ladling another spoonful of batter onto the griddle. \u201cWhy are you guys actually dating,\u201d she mused, a smile dancing on her lips.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not,\u201d he groaned, \u201che left this morning in a hurry, like he just didn\u2019t want to be around me,\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know that\u2019s so far from the truth,\u201d Amber reminded him, \u201cCyrus really cares about you, and loves spending time with you. I\u2019m more mature so I should know,\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould but shorn\u2019t,\u201d TJ mumbled, grabbing another pancake and heading upstairs.</p><hr><p>Cyrus paced outside Jonah\u2019s door, waiting for it to open. What if he didn\u2019t answer? What if he thought something was seriously wrong and didn\u2019t want to be bothered by him? Ah, the many thoughts of an anxiety-ridden teenager.</p><p>\u201cCy, what\u2019s up?\u201d Jonah greeted him, ushering him inside.</p><p>\u201cWe have a problem,\u201d Cyrus groaned, slipping off his shoes and taking a seat on the couch. He pulled his knees into his chest, wrapping his arms around his legs.</p><p>\u201cCare to explain?\u201d Jonah asked, grabbing some pretzels from the kitchen and pouring them into a bowl. He set them down on the table and took a seat by Cyrus.</p><p>\u201cI hate emotions. They\u2019re too confusing,\u201d he mumbled, taking a pretzel and nibbling on it like a squirrel.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re telling me,\u201d Jonah chuckled, \u201cwhat\u2019s this about?\u201d</p><p><i>And here we go</i>, Cyrus thought to himself. He knew exactly what it was about, but he didn\u2019t want to say it out loud. Because saying it out loud would make it real. And that scared him</p><p>\u201cTJ,\u201d he said, voice barely above a whisper. He honestly hoped that Jonah didn\u2019t hear him over the crunching of his pretzels, but given his shift in expression, he probably did.</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Jonah smirked, setting the pretzels aside and batting his lashes, \u201ctell me everything,\u201d</p><p>Cyrus shoved him gently; was it really that obvious? \u201cI think I have a small crush on TJ and I don\u2019t want to talk about it,\u201d he stated, his cheeks turning a shade pinker at the mention of TJ. Now he remembered why he hated having crushes so much.</p><p>\u201cSmall?\u201d Jonah challenged, raising his brows.</p><p>\u201cFine, not so small. Leave me alone,\u201d he pouted, putting his head between his knees.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re here because\u2026?\u201d Jonah trailed.</p><p>Cyrus sighed, bringing his head up slightly. \u201cSorry. I don\u2019t mean to take this out on you,\u201d he apologized, \u201cI just\u2026don\u2019t know who else to come to about this,\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t think to go to Andi or Buffy?\u201d Jonah asked.</p><p>Cyrus shook his head, wincing at the very idea. \u201cThey already think we should be dating. If I told them that I liked him, they\u2019d go berserk and probably tell him,\u201d</p><p>Jonah nodded, seeming to understand. \u201cSo, what are you gonna do? About the TJ thing,\u201d</p><p>Cyrus looked at him like he\u2019d just suggested to commit a murder. \u201cDo? Nothing. Just sit and pine hopelessly until this crush thing blows over,\u201d he supplied. <i>Just like I did with you.</i></p><p>\u201cLook,\u201d Jonah hesitated, \u201cI know I can be oblivious, but like\u2026you gotta admit,\u201d</p><p>Cyrus let out another groan, putting his hands over his face. \u201cNot you too,\u201d he whined.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Jonah mumbled, running his fingers down the groove of the couch.</p><p>Cyrus waved him off, offering a sympathetic smile. \u201cIt\u2019s fine. It\u2019s just\u2026complicated. He\u2019s my best friend, and I don\u2019t wanna ruin things between us,\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll try not to feel too hurt that he\u2019s your <i>best </i>friend,\u201d Jonah chuckled, \u201cIf he\u2019s really your best friend, and he doesn\u2019t return feelings, things will still be okay between you guys. I promise,\u201d he assured Cyrus, \u201cI mean, we\u2019re still friends,\u201d</p><p>Cyrus quirked a brow. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Jonah laughed, putting a hand on Cyrus\u2019 shoulder. \u201cYou think I didn\u2019t know you had a crush on me?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus was stunned, to say the least. Jonah Oblivious Beck knew that he had a crush on him. \u201cDid Buffy tell you? Andi?\u201d</p><p>Jonah shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m not blind, dude. I didn\u2019t wanna tell you until you were over it so I didn\u2019t freak you out,\u201d he explained, \u201cand if you wanted to tell me, things weren\u2019t gonna change, you know,\u201d</p><p>Cyrus felt like he was going to faint, or worse, start crying. \u201cOh,\u201d is the only thing he said, embarrassed beyond words.</p><p>\u201cSeriously, don\u2019t worry about it. You\u2019re over it, I\u2019m with Walker and you\u2019re\u2026basically with TJ,\u201d he chuckled.</p><p>Cyrus rolled his eyes. \u201cIf by basically you mean basically friends, then yeah, sure,\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever you say,\u201d Jonah said, shaking his head.</p><hr><p>\u201cChocolate is the best of all flavors,\u201d Amber argued, looking to Walker, \u201cback me up on this?\u201d</p><p>Walker looked between the girls, Amber with chocolate ice cream and Andi with strawberry. Andi gave him a knowing look, bringing up a finger and dragging it across her throat.</p><p>\u201cYou know, best is a strong word,\u201d he dodged the question, returning to his mint-chocolate, \u201cI don\u2019t think there really is a best,\u201d</p><p>Andi rolled her eyes. \u201cI could be ten dollars richer here,\u201d she mumbled, taking a bite out of her ice cream.</p><p>\u201cIf I say chocolate, will you split the money with me?\u201d Walker asked, earning a glare from Amber.</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t supposed to tell him,\u201d she pouted, \u201cthat\u2019s not fair,\u201d</p><p>Andi shrugged, getting some of the chocolate ice cream around her mouth and on her nose. \u201cLife\u2019s fair because it\u2019s unfair to everyone.\u201d she mused.</p><p>Amber sighed, finishing off her ice cream and grabbing a napkin. \u201cYou need it,\u201d she noted, reaching over and wiping the other girl\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Andi mumbled, finishing off her ice cream and reaching into her pocket, \u201chere, this is for you,\u201d she said. Andi pulled out the bracelet, showing it to Amber who instantly took it into her hands.</p><p>\u201cAfter the last debacle of the bracelets, you made me one?\u201d she said, although it came out more like a question. Her fingers gingerly brushed over the intricate weaving, holding the delicate tassels in her hands.</p><p>\u201cThis one\u2019s different. I\u2019m sure of it,\u201d she assured her, taking the bracelet back and tying it around Amber\u2019s wrist.</p><p>\u201cYou guys do make a cute couple,\u201d Walker cut in, smiling.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re trying to get back on my good side, it\u2019s not working,\u201d Amber chuckled, tossing the napkin in the trash.</p><p>\u201cIf I\u2019m being honest, mint-chip is the best,\u201d</p><p>Both girls turned towards him, bewildered expressions on their faces. \u201cWalker!\u201d</p><hr><p><i>6/27</i></p><p><i>Today I talked to jonah about me and TJ. I think that I\u2019m starting to have a small crush on him. Okay, that\u2019s a lie, it\u2019s a normal crush\u2026fine, a big crush. I have a crush on my best friend and I don\u2019t know what to do about it. Obviously I\u2019m not blind, I can see that TJ\u2019s objectively attractive, but it\u2019s so much more than that.

Are we better off as friends?</i></p><p>Marty let out a frustrated breath, and shut his journal, tossing it onto his desk. Grabbing his pair of sneakers from under his desk, he came down the stairs and headed outside. He started running, trying to clear his head, turning left and not stopping until he collided with someone and was on the ground.</p><p>\u201cWatch it,\u201d came the other voice, and Marty thought he had really hit his head hard.</p><p>\u201cBuffy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarty?\u201d</p><p>The two of them stared at each other; Buffy also sported sneakers and athletic wear. Evidently, she was also going for a run.</p><p>\u201cUm\u2026hi,\u201d he managed, regaining his sense of breath.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d she said, helping him to his feet, \u201cyou okay?\u201d</p><p>Marty nodded, knowing fully he was lying. \u201cI-uh, yeah, yeah totally. I\u2019m totally and completely\u2026fine,\u201d he cracked, blowing out a puff of air.</p><p>\u201cMarty,\u201d Buffy said softly, putting a hand on his shoulder, \u201cjust\u2026say what\u2019s on your mind,\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know about\u2026us,\u201d he whispered after a pause, gesturing vaguely.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean I said I loved you, for fuck\u2019s sake,\u201d he grumbled, screwing his eyes tight and willing himself not to cry, \u201cdoesn\u2019t that\u2026freak you out a little?\u201d</p><p>Buffy hesitated, her hand lingering on his shoulder. \u201cI mean\u2026I was a little surprised, but I still like you a lot, Marty. I\u2019m just not sure about love. I don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like,\u201d she admitted, knitting her hands together.</p><p>Marty kept his head down; he knew the moment he met her eyes he would start crying, and he was not about to do that. \u201cI get it,\u201d he deadpanned. He wondered if biology could explain this pain he felt in his chest; he was fairly certain it wasn\u2019t from the writing.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re still us, right? Buffy and Marty?\u201d Buffy asked, linking her pinky with Marty\u2019s.</p><p>Marty nodded, smiling weakly. \u201cYeah. Still us,\u201d</p><p>Buffy unlinked their pinkies and pulled him in for a hug. She could feel him nearly collapse underneath him, and she didn\u2019t pull away. She felt more out of breath than she did when she was running, and worried that her heart was pounding so hard that she was going to bruise Marty\u2019s ribcage. It was a surge of emotions she hadn\u2019t felt before, and that scared her.</p><p>Marty pulled back, giving her a nod before taking off for the rest of his run, a little bruised from the fall. Buffy stood there, frozen, watching as her boyfriend shrunk in the distance. She put a hand over her heart, feeling it flutter. Her chest ached with a sense of longing; she wanted nothing more right now than to be with Marty. Sitting with him, holding his hand, watching a movie, peppering him with kisses whenever it got boring\u2026</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d she muttered under her breath, turning on her heel to go home, \u201cshit, shit, shit,\u201d she whispered, shaking her head as if it could get rid of this feeling. This strange feeling that she\u2019d never felt before. It felt eerily similar to\u2026no. She wasn\u2019t going to say it; she didn\u2019t even want to say it. Once she said it, it was like the paint drying; permanent, and couldn\u2019t be undone.</p><p><i>Great.</i></p><hr><p>Tag List: \n<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m7R6p_iU9G8Gh8chz1LUkOg\">@shortstackofpeaches || @seanna313</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mB_fjwbYnt6KH-iEEVWn8ig\">@geekingbeautytx</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mx3fTvftLAxW_PMMErDl_UA\">@heavenlybyers ||</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mr1BeThlMP6lSNdCv9_u98w\">@ginnychrises</a>|| <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mq4Fz3LkzWjZC-KqvwLI2IQ\">@wlwandimack</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mlcQ2RsNl23FLSXFuHW7LHA\">@giocondasstuff</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjInWsj0ClAwVBAeG3vRcVw\">@lemonboytyrus</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mNwMw7enpLkLc8PJbIgqIpA\">@adorejrizzle</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mqsacC6O0CwDxqCVXhKqKMg\">@swingsetboys</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m5HZenndZxervK_R1eUWPgA\">@ifellintotyrushell</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mlmDXY_IPGUhgMI0icEk5Fw\">@idk-dude-17</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/md3vq8Jj9kFqSljYsARejoQ\">@rbf-lesbian</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/miY4DTLwRG38LWUEXGrwqQQ\">@marianara-sauce</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mweSXXIeqHwnjzlxWq9XUDw\">@kaptainjinxz</a> || @<a href=\"http://alex-poster-pizz.tumblr.com\">alex-poster-pizz || </a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mPGweOqhfiAqow-tS0I2R6Q\">@quietmarvel</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mdvU81fYq0CNQvV5m2taDGQ\">@blueberry-my-hero-macadamia</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mcbji5TcL-VC-WOCJVAbpjw\">@broadwayitbitch</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mIrWwvtK767VFgc84SQnSmw\">@tjsmuffin</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mNxJK8EhlLcuAxp-Fy8ZbFA\">@tjthekippen</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mD5xwG2u8vIh_s73zuIGl0g\">@idpleasesir</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m7fdykeIYkcOXPu3bLUwexA\">@hi-hello-hey-there</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/miDxY6dUJGULGFxiGQ40Vzw\">@bingewatchingenthusiast</a>|| <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_McecsKdTsnfdqnR2ozw1A\">@booklove-2</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m3KYGYYNAKvqZ_XVFoSWXCg\">@illbeyourreasonwhy</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mEx0042yZEiHRJ3jMqTs-rA\">@birdiesandflowers</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m8CXsQC7iejVYW39YZtzCUg\">@whistlepunk</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m9sonAr6Kx-g7fLYWOoIENQ\">@phinallyjackie</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrTO_xWDLkyEgi4LFyByJMQ\">@thedampjofangirl</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mxUprLHny1HYleRX2Qz3B-Q\">@tyrus4eva</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mDtn4v-rJcfP7a0m51rQAIA\">@tj-is-a-lemony-boy</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mAvcCAzWMuhg5NFzViiC1Uw\">@tj-goodman-bittersweet-boy</a> || @dis-app-oin-tme-nt || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m6_PSslGMLadBwFf51HMVMw\">@nessarinthegay</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m2S891zBEolQhmvw94WEEpA\">@breadisticks</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYctS-TJVaIxMIM1KPeVP1A\">@typewriter-riz</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mpDM4OrcSo5OknyNg-7VgWg\">@gobletofash</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mgjuE9tqgzdBFlw3OUmAPYg\">@bluemuffinboy</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/myeSqX7QQrz4q4ZteKbmoCg\">@sofuuh</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mKemMX29wu_Y_MCi69LuIMQ\">@cheesystars</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfAL43lCQk6VEqq6AxC6GeQ\">@tjmuffin</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m-26HuYTBll7Hj1BqcsOZPA\">@multifandom-bxitch</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/muYk4KP0O5cWwKw3iozZ6nA\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/muYk4KP0O5cWwKw3iozZ6nA\">@allylovessadie</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mCc7FcCPMxCd8PrWuydEr4w\">@hithatsmyname</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mFA7rW6-u7x3w8VNCK_KD7A\">@tyrusinarush</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mFMeKUhkzTWE7ubZ8HduqJA\">@tyrus-lookback</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mhwpAw_kQmNajYckySCFqAg\">@gaycefulwords</a> ||\n\n<br><i></i></p></p>",

But with TJ, he seems \nto be at a loss for words. When they get paired up for a summer \nassignment, Cyrus slowly starts to build a new dictionary. One that \ninvolves TJ and everything they do together. Along the way, maybe he&rsquo;ll \nfind the words to tell him how he feels.</p><p><b>Chapter 12: </b>Kalon<br /></p><p><b>Word Count: </b>2571</p><p><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/16756639/chapters/41046650\"><i>Read on AO3</i></a></p><hr /><p>Light poured into the tree house the next morning through all the leaves. Patches of warm, golden sunlight patterned the boys. A strip of light fell across Cyrus&rsquo; face, causing him to stir a little and out stretch his limbs. He hit something, or rather someone, and was a little startled to note TJ was there with him. He blinked his eyes a few times, remembering the events of last night. Smiling to himself, he rested on his arm, looking at TJ, who was still sleeping.</p><p>Up close he was able to see all his freckles; a small collection by his ear, a few on his right cheek, and a smatter of them across his nose. His glasses had slid off during the night, seeing at they were a few feet away from him. His hair that was normally neatly combed back was sticking out in all different directions, some of it coming down and hiding some of his forehead. His long lashes brushed his skin ever so lightly, the stark contrast of the dark lashes against his fair skin evident in the light. His nose, a little upturned, blowing out soft puffs of air as he slept. It was really cute.</p><p>Wait. No. Not cute. It wasn&rsquo;t cute.</p><p>Cyrus tried to shake that possibility out of his head, but it didn&rsquo;t want to leave. The word cute seemed to now be permanently ingrained in his brain. He felt his heart hitting his ribcage, feeling like he was going to break his bones, it was beating so hard. He scrambled off of TJ, pushing his arm hard enough to wake him up, stretching his arms up towards one edge of the tree house.</p><p>&ldquo;Sorry, I-I didn&rsquo;t mean to wake you,&rdquo; Cyrus stammered, rubbing the back of his neck, &ldquo;I-I just realized that I have to get my stuff from Andi&rsquo;s house,&rdquo; he lied. Okay, well it wasn&rsquo;t a complete lie.</p><p>TJ rubbed his eyes, reaching and grabbing his glasses. &ldquo;Oh, okay. Do you wanna get some breakfast? I can m-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;-no, that&rsquo;s fine,&rdquo; Cyrus cut in quickly, scrambling to his feet, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not huge on breakfast,&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You inhale pancakes like a vacuum,&rdquo; TJ mumbled, propping himself up on his elbows.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not hungry,&rdquo; he lied again, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see you later,&rdquo; he mumbled, climbing down the first few rungs of the ladder and jumping onto the ground. He started running towards Andi&rsquo;s house, leaving behind a very confused and slightly hurt TJ.</p><hr /><p>TJ shut the door, rubbing his eyes as he strolled into the kitchen. &ldquo;Morning,&rdquo; he mumbled, seeing Amber already making breakfast, &ldquo;pancakes?&rdquo;</p><p>Amber nodded, flipping one over with a satisfying sizzle. &ldquo;Why were you outside?&rdquo; she asked, setting the spatula aside, &ldquo;go for an early morning run?&rdquo;</p><p>TJ shook his head, grabbing a pancake off the top of the stack and taking a bite out of it. &ldquo;Cyrus came by last night at around two in the morning. Said he couldn&rsquo;t sleep,&rdquo; he explained as he chewed, &ldquo;so we went up in the tree house and talked and then we fell asleep,&rdquo;</p><p>Amber shook her head, ladling another spoonful of batter onto the griddle. &ldquo;Why are you guys actually dating,&rdquo; she mused, a smile dancing on her lips.</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not,&rdquo; he groaned, &ldquo;he left this morning in a hurry, like he just didn&rsquo;t want to be around me,&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You know that&rsquo;s so far from the truth,&rdquo; Amber reminded him, &ldquo;Cyrus really cares about you, and loves spending time with you. I&rsquo;m more mature so I should know,&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Should but shorn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; TJ mumbled, grabbing another pancake and heading upstairs.</p><hr /><p>Cyrus paced outside Jonah&rsquo;s door, waiting for it to open. What if he didn&rsquo;t answer? What if he thought something was seriously wrong and didn&rsquo;t want to be bothered by him? Ah, the many thoughts of an anxiety-ridden teenager.</p><p>&ldquo;Cy, what&rsquo;s up?&rdquo; Jonah greeted him, ushering him inside.</p><p>&ldquo;We have a problem,&rdquo; Cyrus groaned, slipping off his shoes and taking a seat on the couch. He pulled his knees into his chest, wrapping his arms around his legs.</p><p>&ldquo;Care to explain?&rdquo; Jonah asked, grabbing some pretzels from the kitchen and pouring them into a bowl. He set them down on the table and took a seat by Cyrus.</p><p>&ldquo;I hate emotions. They&rsquo;re too confusing,&rdquo; he mumbled, taking a pretzel and nibbling on it like a squirrel.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re telling me,&rdquo; Jonah chuckled, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s this about?&rdquo;</p><p><i>And here we go</i>, Cyrus thought to himself. He knew exactly what it was about, but he didn&rsquo;t want to say it out loud. Because saying it out loud would make it real. And that scared him</p><p>&ldquo;TJ,&rdquo; he said, voice barely above a whisper. He honestly hoped that Jonah didn&rsquo;t hear him over the crunching of his pretzels, but given his shift in expression, he probably did.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh?&rdquo; Jonah smirked, setting the pretzels aside and batting his lashes, &ldquo;tell me everything,&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus shoved him gently; was it really that obvious? &ldquo;I think I have a small crush on TJ and I don&rsquo;t want to talk about it,&rdquo; he stated, his cheeks turning a shade pinker at the mention of TJ. Now he remembered why he hated having crushes so much.</p><p>&ldquo;Small?&rdquo; Jonah challenged, raising his brows.</p><p>&ldquo;Fine, not so small. Leave me alone,&rdquo; he pouted, putting his head between his knees.</p><p>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re here because&hellip;?&rdquo; Jonah trailed.</p><p>Cyrus sighed, bringing his head up slightly. &ldquo;Sorry. I don&rsquo;t mean to take this out on you,&rdquo; he apologized, &ldquo;I just&hellip;don&rsquo;t know who else to come to about this,&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t think to go to Andi or Buffy?&rdquo; Jonah asked.</p><p>Cyrus shook his head, wincing at the very idea. &ldquo;They already think we should be dating. If I told them that I liked him, they&rsquo;d go berserk and probably tell him,&rdquo;</p><p>Jonah nodded, seeming to understand. &ldquo;So, what are you gonna do? About the TJ thing,&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus looked at him like he&rsquo;d just suggested to commit a murder. &ldquo;Do? Nothing. Just sit and pine hopelessly until this crush thing blows over,&rdquo; he supplied. <i>Just like I did with you.</i></p><p>&ldquo;Look,&rdquo; Jonah hesitated, &ldquo;I know I can be oblivious, but like&hellip;you gotta admit,&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus let out another groan, putting his hands over his face. &ldquo;Not you too,&rdquo; he whined.</p><p>&ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; Jonah mumbled, running his fingers down the groove of the couch.</p><p>Cyrus waved him off, offering a sympathetic smile. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine. It&rsquo;s just&hellip;complicated. He&rsquo;s my best friend, and I don&rsquo;t wanna ruin things between us,&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try not to feel too hurt that he&rsquo;s your <i>best </i>friend,&rdquo; Jonah chuckled, &ldquo;If he&rsquo;s really your best friend, and he doesn&rsquo;t return feelings, things will still be okay between you guys. I promise,&rdquo; he assured Cyrus, &ldquo;I mean, we&rsquo;re still friends,&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus quirked a brow. &ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p><p>Jonah laughed, putting a hand on Cyrus&rsquo; shoulder. &ldquo;You think I didn&rsquo;t know you had a crush on me?&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus was stunned, to say the least. Jonah Oblivious Beck knew that he had a crush on him. &ldquo;Did Buffy tell you? Andi?&rdquo;</p><p>Jonah shook his head. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not blind, dude. I didn&rsquo;t wanna tell you until you were over it so I didn&rsquo;t freak you out,&rdquo; he explained, &ldquo;and if you wanted to tell me, things weren&rsquo;t gonna change, you know,&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus felt like he was going to faint, or worse, start crying. &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; is the only thing he said, embarrassed beyond words.</p><p>&ldquo;Seriously, don&rsquo;t worry about it. You&rsquo;re over it, I&rsquo;m with Walker and you&rsquo;re&hellip;basically with TJ,&rdquo; he chuckled.</p><p>Cyrus rolled his eyes. &ldquo;If by basically you mean basically friends, then yeah, sure,&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Whatever you say,&rdquo; Jonah said, shaking his head.</p><hr /><p>&ldquo;Chocolate is the best of all flavors,&rdquo; Amber argued, looking to Walker, &ldquo;back me up on this?&rdquo;</p><p>Walker looked between the girls, Amber with chocolate ice cream and Andi with strawberry. Andi gave him a knowing look, bringing up a finger and dragging it across her throat.</p><p>&ldquo;You know, best is a strong word,&rdquo; he dodged the question, returning to his mint-chocolate, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think there really is a best,&rdquo;</p><p>Andi rolled her eyes. &ldquo;I could be ten dollars richer here,&rdquo; she mumbled, taking a bite out of her ice cream.</p><p>&ldquo;If I say chocolate, will you split the money with me?&rdquo; Walker asked, earning a glare from Amber.</p><p>&ldquo;You weren&rsquo;t supposed to tell him,&rdquo; she pouted, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s not fair,&rdquo;</p><p>Andi shrugged, getting some of the chocolate ice cream around her mouth and on her nose. &ldquo;Life&rsquo;s fair because it&rsquo;s unfair to everyone.&rdquo; she mused.</p><p>Amber sighed, finishing off her ice cream and grabbing a napkin. &ldquo;You need it,&rdquo; she noted, reaching over and wiping the other girl&rsquo;s face.</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; Andi mumbled, finishing off her ice cream and reaching into her pocket, &ldquo;here, this is for you,&rdquo; she said. Andi pulled out the bracelet, showing it to Amber who instantly took it into her hands.</p><p>&ldquo;After the last debacle of the bracelets, you made me one?&rdquo; she said, although it came out more like a question. Her fingers gingerly brushed over the intricate weaving, holding the delicate tassels in her hands.</p><p>&ldquo;This one&rsquo;s different. I&rsquo;m sure of it,&rdquo; she assured her, taking the bracelet back and tying it around Amber&rsquo;s wrist.</p><p>&ldquo;You guys do make a cute couple,&rdquo; Walker cut in, smiling.</p><p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re trying to get back on my good side, it&rsquo;s not working,&rdquo; Amber chuckled, tossing the napkin in the trash.</p><p>&ldquo;If I&rsquo;m being honest, mint-chip is the best,&rdquo;</p><p>Both girls turned towards him, bewildered expressions on their faces. &ldquo;Walker!&rdquo;</p><hr /><p><i>6/27</i></p><p><i>Today I talked to jonah about me and TJ.

Evidently, she was also going for a run.</p><p>&ldquo;Um&hellip;hi,&rdquo; he managed, regaining his sense of breath.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey,&rdquo; she said, helping him to his feet, &ldquo;you okay?&rdquo;</p><p>Marty nodded, knowing fully he was lying. &ldquo;I-uh, yeah, yeah totally. I&rsquo;m totally and completely&hellip;fine,&rdquo; he cracked, blowing out a puff of air.</p><p>&ldquo;Marty,&rdquo; Buffy said softly, putting a hand on his shoulder, &ldquo;just&hellip;say what&rsquo;s on your mind,&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about&hellip;us,&rdquo; he whispered after a pause, gesturing vaguely.</p><p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I mean I said I loved you, for fuck&rsquo;s sake,&rdquo; he grumbled, screwing his eyes tight and willing himself not to cry, &ldquo;doesn&rsquo;t that&hellip;freak you out a little?&rdquo;</p><p>Buffy hesitated, her hand lingering on his shoulder. &ldquo;I mean&hellip;I was a little surprised, but I still like you a lot, Marty. I&rsquo;m just not sure about love. I don&rsquo;t know what it&rsquo;s like,&rdquo; she admitted, knitting her hands together.</p><p>Marty kept his head down; he knew the moment he met her eyes he would start crying, and he was not about to do that. &ldquo;I get it,&rdquo; he deadpanned. He wondered if biology could explain this pain he felt in his chest; he was fairly certain it wasn&rsquo;t from the writing.</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re still us, right? Buffy and Marty?&rdquo; Buffy asked, linking her pinky with Marty&rsquo;s.</p><p>Marty nodded, smiling weakly. &ldquo;Yeah. Still us,&rdquo;</p><p>Buffy unlinked their pinkies and pulled him in for a hug. She could feel him nearly collapse underneath him, and she didn&rsquo;t pull away. She felt more out of breath than she did when she was running, and worried that her heart was pounding so hard that she was going to bruise Marty&rsquo;s ribcage. It was a surge of emotions she hadn&rsquo;t felt before, and that scared her.</p><p>Marty pulled back, giving her a nod before taking off for the rest of his run, a little bruised from the fall. Buffy stood there, frozen, watching as her boyfriend shrunk in the distance. She put a hand over her heart, feeling it flutter. Her chest ached with a sense of longing; she wanted nothing more right now than to be with Marty. Sitting with him, holding his hand, watching a movie, peppering him with kisses whenever it got boring&hellip;</p><p>&ldquo;Shit,&rdquo; she muttered under her breath, turning on her heel to go home, &ldquo;shit, shit, shit,&rdquo; she whispered, shaking her head as if it could get rid of this feeling. This strange feeling that she&rsquo;d never felt before. It felt eerily similar to&hellip;no. She wasn&rsquo;t going to say it; she didn&rsquo;t even want to say it. Once she said it, it was like the paint drying; permanent, and couldn&rsquo;t be undone.</p><p><i>Great.</i></p><hr /><p>Tag List: \n<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m7R6p_iU9G8Gh8chz1LUkOg\">@shortstackofpeaches || @seanna313</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mB_fjwbYnt6KH-iEEVWn8ig\">@geekingbeautytx</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mx3fTvftLAxW_PMMErDl_UA\">@heavenlybyers ||</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mr1BeThlMP6lSNdCv9_u98w\">@ginnychrises</a>|| <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mq4Fz3LkzWjZC-KqvwLI2IQ\">@wlwandimack</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mlcQ2RsNl23FLSXFuHW7LHA\">@giocondasstuff</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjInWsj0ClAwVBAeG3vRcVw\">@lemonboytyrus</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mNwMw7enpLkLc8PJbIgqIpA\">@adorejrizzle</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mqsacC6O0CwDxqCVXhKqKMg\">@swingsetboys</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m5HZenndZxervK_R1eUWPgA\">@ifellintotyrushell</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mlmDXY_IPGUhgMI0icEk5Fw\">@idk-dude-17</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/md3vq8Jj9kFqSljYsARejoQ\">@rbf-lesbian</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/miY4DTLwRG38LWUEXGrwqQQ\">@marianara-sauce</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mweSXXIeqHwnjzlxWq9XUDw\">@kaptainjinxz</a> || @<a href=\"http://alex-poster-pizz.tumblr.com\">alex-poster-pizz || </a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mPGweOqhfiAqow-tS0I2R6Q\">@quietmarvel</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mdvU81fYq0CNQvV5m2taDGQ\">@blueberry-my-hero-macadamia</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mcbji5TcL-VC-WOCJVAbpjw\">@broadwayitbitch</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mIrWwvtK767VFgc84SQnSmw\">@tjsmuffin</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mNxJK8EhlLcuAxp-Fy8ZbFA\">@tjthekippen</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mD5xwG2u8vIh_s73zuIGl0g\">@idpleasesir</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m7fdykeIYkcOXPu3bLUwexA\">@hi-hello-hey-there</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/miDxY6dUJGULGFxiGQ40Vzw\">@bingewatchingenthusiast</a>|| <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_McecsKdTsnfdqnR2ozw1A\">@booklove-2</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m3KYGYYNAKvqZ_XVFoSWXCg\">@illbeyourreasonwhy</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mEx0042yZEiHRJ3jMqTs-rA\">@birdiesandflowers</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m8CXsQC7iejVYW39YZtzCUg\">@whistlepunk</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m9sonAr6Kx-g7fLYWOoIENQ\">@phinallyjackie</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrTO_xWDLkyEgi4LFyByJMQ\">@thedampjofangirl</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mxUprLHny1HYleRX2Qz3B-Q\">@tyrus4eva</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mDtn4v-rJcfP7a0m51rQAIA\">@tj-is-a-lemony-boy</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mAvcCAzWMuhg5NFzViiC1Uw\">@tj-goodman-bittersweet-boy</a> || @dis-app-oin-tme-nt || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m6_PSslGMLadBwFf51HMVMw\">@nessarinthegay</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m2S891zBEolQhmvw94WEEpA\">@breadisticks</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYctS-TJVaIxMIM1KPeVP1A\">@typewriter-riz</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mpDM4OrcSo5OknyNg-7VgWg\">@gobletofash</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mgjuE9tqgzdBFlw3OUmAPYg\">@bluemuffinboy</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/myeSqX7QQrz4q4ZteKbmoCg\">@sofuuh</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mKemMX29wu_Y_MCi69LuIMQ\">@cheesystars</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfAL43lCQk6VEqq6AxC6GeQ\">@tjmuffin</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m-26HuYTBll7Hj1BqcsOZPA\">@multifandom-bxitch</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/muYk4KP0O5cWwKw3iozZ6nA\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/muYk4KP0O5cWwKw3iozZ6nA\">@allylovessadie</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mCc7FcCPMxCd8PrWuydEr4w\">@hithatsmyname</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mFA7rW6-u7x3w8VNCK_KD7A\">@tyrusinarush</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mFMeKUhkzTWE7ubZ8HduqJA\">@tyrus-lookback</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mhwpAw_kQmNajYckySCFqAg\">@gaycefulwords</a> ||\n\n<br /><i></i></p></p>",

One that \ninvolves TJ and everything they do together. Along the way, maybe he&rsquo;ll \nfind the words to tell him how he feels.</p>\n<p><b>Chapter 12: </b>Kalon<br /></p>\n<p><b>Word Count: </b>2571</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/16756639/chapters/41046650\"><i>Read on AO3</i></a></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Light poured into the tree house the next morning through all the leaves. Patches of warm, golden sunlight patterned the boys. A strip of light fell across Cyrus&rsquo; face, causing him to stir a little and out stretch his limbs. He hit something, or rather someone, and was a little startled to note TJ was there with him. He blinked his eyes a few times, remembering the events of last night. Smiling to himself, he rested on his arm, looking at TJ, who was still sleeping.</p>\n<p>Up close he was able to see all his freckles; a small collection by his ear, a few on his right cheek, and a smatter of them across his nose. His glasses had slid off during the night, seeing at they were a few feet away from him. His hair that was normally neatly combed back was sticking out in all different directions, some of it coming down and hiding some of his forehead. His long lashes brushed his skin ever so lightly, the stark contrast of the dark lashes against his fair skin evident in the light. His nose, a little upturned, blowing out soft puffs of air as he slept. It was really cute.</p>\n<p>Wait. No. Not cute. It wasn&rsquo;t cute.</p>\n</p>",

        "answer": "<p>I\u2019m assuming this was meant to say\u00a0\u201cchild actors shouldn\u2019t be acting\u201d, correct?\u00a0</p><p>Okay, so I\u2019m always conflicted about this because there is obviously a lot of toxicity surrounding the entertainment industry, and it seems to hit young talent the hardest. However, I think it is unrealistic and problematic to eliminate the concept of child stars altogether. It\u2019s very important that children are involved in the creation of media meant for children. Kids need to see themselves portrayed on screen. Kids need to have some say in the kind of content they are being fed. But the entertainment industry still has a long way to go as far as making itself safe for child actors and entertainers. They need better publicity training, stricter guidelines re: child labor, better social media management, and most importantly: better and more long-term resources to prepare child actors for adulthood. Large networks that are responsible for the well-being of children should put more of an effort into making sure they have proper healthcare, easy access to mental healthcare, financial management resources, help and preparation for transitioning from the entertainment industry to higher education or alternate work forces, and some kind of safety net of resources to help make sure their former talent doesn\u2019t crash and burn as soon as they turn 21. That may not be Disney Channel\u2019s job, but it should be their responsibility and a company as large as Disney certainly has the resources to make at least some of these things happen.

I\u2019ve never got treated like this until this summer, and it\u2019s absolute hell. </p><p> I started putting things in my locker when all of a sudden two large hands grabbed my shirt and threw me against my locker.</p><p>\u201cWatch where you\u2019re going, faggot.\u201d </p><p>It was Ashton Ferrill aka my greatest fear. I shook as I breathed heavily, trying to release from his grip.</p><p>\u201cHey, Asher homophobia is so 2008, lay off.\u201d I heard a voice above me say. I looked up to see TJ putting his bag in his locker. TJ, scary basketball guy and Buffy\u2019s kryptonite, is standing up for me. </p><p>Asher rolled his eyes and let go of my shirt forcefully, making me fall to the ground. TJ\u2019s hand stuck in front of my face to help me up. I smiled and accepted his hand. He smiled this beautiful smile, a smile I feel like I\u2019ve waited my whole life to see unknowingly. His smile just made all of the bad feelings Asher gave me just suck out of me.</p><p>\u201cAirpods huh?\u201d He chuckled, \u201cmust feel nice to be rich.\u201d</p><p>I laughed softly and flipped my non existent long hair, \u201cNot to flex or anything.\u201d</p><p>He smiled again before leaving for class. This time, I threw myself onto my locker and smiled to myself. </p><p>Maybe this year won\u2019t be so bad after all.</p><p>-</p><p>It was after school and my best friend Amber and I were sitting on her couch talking about our days.</p><p>\u201cOn a scale of 1-kill me now, it was a solid, maybe don\u2019t kill me because boys are really cute.\u201d I dished out all the details of the first day \u00a0to Amber as she silently flipped through channels on her family television.
