        "body": "<p><b>Story Summary:</b> When Cyrus finds a playlist on TJ\u2019s desktop full of old love songs, he realizes that TJ has never been a scary basketball guy but rather a huge sap. TJ just wished Cyrus could realize that all of those songs remind him of a certain boy who likes chocolate chocolate chip muffins without telling him directly.</p><p>With insecurities and fears almost set in stone, it\u2019s hard for TJ to admit that he has a heart aching crush on Cyrus who is trying to avoid just that. Of course, it doesn\u2019t seem like both of them are trying to get over each other when they\u2019re always together.</p><p><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/15801564/chapters/36906042\">Ao3 Link</a>\u00a0|<a href=\"https://lgbtyrus.tumblr.com/post/177469568929/tjs-playlist-chapter-2\"> Previous Chapter</a></p><p><b>Words:</b> 4,627</p><!-- more --><p>Cyrus nervously walked inside his house, his mom and stepdad\nwaiting in the sitting room. \u201cH-ey, guys,\u201d Cyrus gave them a little wave, his\nvoice cracking. </p><p>\u201cWhere were you,\u201d his mom asked, running up to him to give\nhim a hug.</p><p>\u201cAround the block at a friend\u2019s house,\u201d Cyrus said, hugging\nhis mom back. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry I forgot to text. We watched a movie and fell\nasleep. I understand if I\u2019m in trouble. I deserve to get in trouble.\u201d His mom\npulled away from the hug, but still had a firm grip on his shoulders.</p><p>She sighed and told him with a small smile, \u201cYou\u2019re not in\ntrouble. You just forgot to text me. I trust you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh thank goodness,\u201d Cyrus sighed in relief. \u201cI was really\nscared for a moment.\u201d</p><p>His mom let out a small laugh, \u201cJust don\u2019t let it happen\nagain.\u201d Cyrus nodded. \u201cAlso, call your friends. I think Buffy is more worried\nthan I am. Dinner is in the microwave. We ate without you, sorry.\u201d Cyrus gave\nher another hug before walking into the kitchen to get his dinner. When he sat\ndown at the table, he made sure to text TJ before he got his ear blown off by\nBuffy and forgot.</p><p><b>Cyrus: </b>Made\nit home alive and I\u2019m not grounded!!</p><p><b>TJ: </b>sounds\ngood underdog </p><p><b>TJ: </b>sorry\nI forgot to feed you</p><p><b>TJ: </b>I was\nthinking of ordering a pizza when I fell asleep</p><p><b>Cyrus: </b>don\u2019t\nworry about it. Since I didn\u2019t get grounded, I\u2019m allowed to eat dinner.</p><p><b>Cyrus: </b>don\u2019t\ntake that seriously</p><p><b>TJ: </b>lol I\nwon\u2019t.</p><p><b>TJ: </b>you\nforgot your polaroid \u2639 I\u2019ll take it to you Monday at school okay?</p><p><b>Cyrus: </b>Just\nrealized that :o Ty!!</p><p><b>TJ: </b>yeah\nof course. It\u2019s nothing. After all, you risked going blind for those photos :P</p><p><b>Cyrus: </b>I\ncan\u2019t believe you really put my eye sight at risk for some photos</p><p><b>TJ: </b>hey,\nyou\u2019re the one that wanted to be on my ceiling. I hung up the photo I\u2019m keeping\nalready. Oh by the way, Amber wanted me to send you this [img]</p><p>It was a picture of TJ and Cyrus sleeping on the couch\nearlier. TJ was slumped over, his head resting between Cyrus\u2019 shoulder and\nhead. They both had small content smiles on their faces. It was a peaceful\npicture. As Cyrus stared at the picture for a moment too long, his phone\nstarted ringing. It was Buffy asking to merge him in a video call. \u201cOh man,\u201d\nCyrus mumbled. He hesitated but answered anyways, already flinching before\nBuffy had a chance to say anything.</p><p>\u201cHey answered!\u201d he heard Andi say in delight. \u201cFinally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, guys,\u201d Cyrus smiled, waving his spoon in front of the\nscreen.</p><p>\u201cHey guys?\u201d Buffy scoffed. \u201cWe\u2019ve been worried sick! I\nthought TJ had gotten you killed or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re being dramatic, Buffy,\u201d Cyrus laughed. \u201cI just hung\nout at his place and forgot to tell my mom. Nothing bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why didn\u2019t you answer?\u201d Buffy frowned. \u201cWere you\nignoring us?\u201d Cyrus felt guilty now. He didn\u2019t realize there was still some\nnegative tension left between TJ and Buffy. He knew it was that because Andi\nseemed to be fine. Buffy was the one that if given the word, she\u2019d put a stake\nthrough TJ\u2019s heart for Cyrus without hesitation.</p><p>\u201cNo, no,\u201d Cyrus quickly shook his head. \u201cI swear I wasn\u2019t.\nWe fell asleep watching Hotel Transylvania.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHotel Transylvania?\u201d Andi giggled. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t too scary\nfor you?\u201d Cyrus smirked and shook his head. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still really sorry, though,\u201d Cyrus told them with an\napologetic expression. Buffy\u2019s angry expression fell off her face, turning into\na solemn one. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to worry you guys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Buffy finally told him after a pause. \u201cBut do it\nagain, and I\u2019ll put you both in a casket.\u201d She ended up letting out a snort, \u201cI\ncan\u2019t believe you went to TJ Kippen\u2019s house.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus thought about it for a second and said, \u201cMe either. I\nthink I\u2019m getting somewhere with our \u2018The Kippen\u2019s are Vampires\u2019 theory. Their\ndecoration? Completely gothic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe his parents were total goth kids in school and never\ngrew out of it,\u201d Andi laughed. \u201cBowie and Bex seem to still have punk rock in\ntheir veins.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably,\u201d Buffy said, \u201cor they\u2019re vampires. I\u2019d say let\u2019s\nput a stake through Amber\u2019s heart to see if she\u2019ll turn into a bat, but she\u2019s\ngrown on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPutting a steak through her heart would kill her,\u201d Andi\nsmiled and shook her head. \u201cJust ask her if you can have a glass of blood next\ntime we\u2019re at The Spoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re too mean, guys,\u201d Cyrus shook his head, not once his\nsmile falling off. He was eating, talking to his friends in their secluded\ntrio, and his heart was still a fluttering mess.</p><p>\u201cToo mean? To the Kippens?\u201d Buffy let out a fake laugh. \u201cWow.\nAmber Kippen. I really thought she was going to be Amber Fubergoobeld\u2019schnoppert\nto me my whole life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t deny that they\u2019ve changed a lot,\u201d Andi told them.\nShe stayed silent for a bit before saying, \u201cAmber apologized to me. Like.\nFully. I was past it, but it made me feel a lot better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s really good,\u201d Cyrus smiled widely. \u201cShe\u2019s the reason\nwe woke up in the first place. I might still be over there if she hadn\u2019t gotten\nhome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWasn\u2019t it their dad\u2019s birthday?\u201d Andi asked him. Cyrus\npaused. He had forgotten about that.</p><p>\u201cWell his parents weren\u2019t there,\u201d Cyrus told them, getting\nan itch to ask TJ.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you were left unsupervised with a vampire,\u201d\nBuffy shook her head, not realizing that there was something bothering the two.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Cyrus went along, \u201cit would\u2019ve been me and three\nvampires, so it wouldn\u2019t have had made the situation any better if we\u2019re being\ncompletely honest.\u201d Andi knew something Cyrus didn\u2019t, and it looked obvious. He\nwished he could make direct eye contact with her to get her to spill, but if it\ninvolved Amber, Cyrus had a feeling it was private. Amber had a lot of secrets\nand in their short-lived friendship, who knew how much Andi had learned. Cyrus took\nan initiative and said, \u201cI\u2019m going to text TJ real fast. Remember I can still\nhear you!\u201d </p><p>Cyrus went off screen from the video chat and went to text\nTJ. He couldn\u2019t help but smile big when he caught sight of the photo he had\nlast sent. \u201cYour camera is still on!\u201d Buffy chided. \u201cWhat are you smiling at\nlike a big goof?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll send it right now,\u201d Cyrus lied. He made a quick wish\nfor them to forget about it before go back to the video call app to turn off\nhis camera. He opened his texts with TJ once more and blocked out Buffy and\nAndi\u2019s side conversation as he tried to think of something to say.</p><p><b>Cyrus: </b>wow\nwe look good</p><p><b>Cyrus: </b>anyways\ndid you guys do anything for your dad\u2019s birthday??</p><p><b>TJ: </b>I\nprobably wont see him until tomorrow if I\u2019m being honest. I just found out my\nmom is staying in for another shift, so it\u2019s just Amber, Macaroni, and I for\nanother night.</p><p><b>Cyrus: </b>Macaroni???!</p><p><b>TJ: </b>we\nhave a cat. Kind of does his own thing in the streets but always comes back at\nnight. He doesn\u2019t like me very much so he only likes to be inside when Amber is\nhere. I think he knows who pays for the food and who forgets to fill up his\nwater bowl. </p><p><b>Cyrus: </b>I\ncan\u2019t believe you hid a whole cat from me</p><p><b>TJ: </b>I hid\nmy whole ass sister from you and you\u2019re mad about the cat gkjsfghjksdfgh</p><p><b>Cyrus: </b>my\nfeelings are hurt!!</p><p>\u201cYou still there, Cy?\u201d Andi asked. Cyrus switched back to\nlook at them and turned on his camera.</p><p>\u201cHey, hello,\u201d he waved his fingers. \u201cI\u2019ve done some\ninvestigating, and they will not be celebrating TJ\u2019s dad\u2019s birthday. It\u2019s just\nhim, Amber, and their cat Macaroni for the night. I don\u2019t know what to do with\nthis information now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe either,\u201d Andi frowned.</p><p>\u201cAmber didn\u2019t seem that bummed out from it,\u201d Buffy\ncommented. \u201cTJ was the one that looked a little weird when she said it beat her\nass.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus gasped, \u201cBuffy don\u2019t cuss.\u201d Buffy gave her camera a\nlook that told her she was holding back a \u201cfuck you\u201d, but she just turned it\ninto a playful eyeroll.</p><p>\u201cAnyways, I\u2019m sure the vamps are fine,\u201d Buffy reassured\nthem. Cyrus and Andi agreed before Buffy smirked, \u201cSo Cyrus. What were you\nsmiling at?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d Cyrus whispered.</p><p>-</p><p>TJ once again woke up at 2AM, but not at his own accord.\nAmber was shaking him. He felt something small crawl across his legs above the\nblankets heard Amber whispering. \u201cWhy do you whisper when you\u2019re trying to wake\nme up,\u201d TJ groaned, rubbing his eyes. \u201cWhat time is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo,\u201d Amber said, still whispering. \u201cCan I sleep with you?\nMom is on the phone with dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s home?\u201d TJ sat up. He scooted towards the wall to make\nroom for Amber to sit down.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s been home,\u201d Amber said as she crawled into the bed.\nShe held her knees up to her chest and rested her chin on top of them. \u201cI think\nshe got in trouble at work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh shit,\u201d TJ frowned. \u201cThat\u2019s not good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not good at all,\u201d Amber started crying. TJ put an\narm around her as her tears got into a flow. TJ tended to ignore everything\nthat went on with their parents, but Amber was the one that paid attention to\nit all. She was their messenger when the fights were horrendous, and she was\nthe one that got lashed on for trying to get them to stop. TJ didn\u2019t try\nanything because one, Amber wouldn\u2019t let him. Two, he was a coward. He would\njust plug in his earbuds and close his eyes until he was asleep. \u201cWhat are we\ngoing to do?\u201d she sobbed.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be okay,\u201d TJ assured her. \u201cWe have what GG left me if\nanything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Amber pulled away and shook her head. She started\nwiping her tears. She hated it when TJ saw her cry. \u201cThat\u2019s your money for\ncollege.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t go to college,\u201d TJ told her. \u201cI\u2019m stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re not, TJ,\u201d Amber lightly tugged his ears. \u201cYou\u2019re\nso so smart. Just because you don\u2019t know how to do equations, it doesn\u2019t mean\nyou don\u2019t know who the thirteenth president of the United States is.\u201d TJ bit\nhis lip.</p><p>\u201cIf she gets fired-,\u201d TJ started but Amber nudged him in the\nstomach, making him jump back a little.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think she got fired. She probably just won\u2019t get\novertime anymore. But still. Dad needs to land a job. Quick,\u201d she told him,\nshifting to hug her knees again.</p><p>\u201cDo you think we\u2019ll have to move towns?\u201d TJ asked her. He\nhad been afraid of that since their dad said he had to look at places out of\nShadyside. He had had three interviews so far.</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d Amber mumbled. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t want to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe either,\u201d TJ told her, looking up at his ceiling. He\ncouldn\u2019t see the picture, but he was staring right at the spot where he had his\npolaroid with Cyrus. He couldn\u2019t leave now. </p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Amber sighed and laid down, \u201cnight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNight,\u201d TJ mumbled. He didn\u2019t lay down though. He stayed\nsitting up, occasionally petting Macaroni who hated it when Amber moved. He\nwould let out little mews and rub his head into TJ\u2019s hand until he fell asleep\nagain. Amber was a crazy sleeper and often gave TJ bruises on his legs when she\nstayed in his bed. It wasn\u2019t too often, but when it did happen, he felt like\nthey got closer. It was why he couldn\u2019t get mad at her or pick on her like he\nused to. They had enough going on. TJ laid down, but he couldn\u2019t get his eyes\nclosed. He stared at the spot with the polaroid, songs stuck in his head until\nhe eventually was able to make out Cyrus\u2019 smile as the sunshine poured in\nthrough the windows.</p><p>He smiled back at it and fell asleep.</p><p>It was twelve in the afternoon when he woke up alone in bed.\nAmber and Macaroni were gone. The sun from the blinds was hitting him directly\nwhich meant that Amber had opened them for him. He liked basking in the sun. It\nfelt warm and safe as if sunshine could never hurt him.</p><p>He rolled over and reached for his phone. He had gotten a\nmessage from Cyrus at 9AM, saying good morning with the sunshine emoji. TJ\nsmiled at it and opened it.</p><p><b>TJ: </b>Good\nmorning underdog. I slept late today</p><p><b>Cyrus: </b>I\nunderstand. You deserve it!</p><p><b>TJ: </b>That\u2019s\nsweet of you to say</p><p><b>Cyrus: </b>what\nare the plans for today?</p><p><b>TJ: </b>I have\nwork at 2 today so that\u2019s going to be fun. u can drop by if you want</p><p><b>Cyrus: </b>I think\nI\u2019m hanging out with Jonah and Andi today around that time but if I manage to\nescape early, ill go by \ud83d\ude0a don\u2019t expect me to do anything tho. Im just\nthere to observe how Shadyside\u2019s vampire interacts with kids</p><p><b>Cyrus: </b>haha\nis that why you guys live in Shadyside. Because it\u2019s shady and there will be no\nsun</p><p><b>TJ: </b>oh\nhardy har har </p><p><b>TJ: </b>I\nactually lay in the sun every morning for a while so I think your vampire theory\nis dead</p><p><b>Cyrus: </b>you\u2019re\na fool TJ Kippen. Vampires never die.</p><p><b>TJ: </b>I\u2019m\ngoing to turn into a bat and fly away next time I see you I swear. </p><p><b>Cyrus: </b>well\nyou can\u2019t because I need my polaroid picture back</p><p><b>TJ: </b>you\ngot me there</p><p>TJ rolled out of bed and went to\nshower, playing music on his speaker. He didn\u2019t hear anyone else, so he assumed\neveryone else was out. Amber had said something about getting brunch with some\nfriends before work the night before, and he assumed his dad wasn\u2019t back yet. His\nmom was a different question and he didn\u2019t bother asking himself where she possibly\ncould have had gone. </p><p>He scrolled through his phone through his many playlists and\nsaw C.C.C.M. \u00a0He smiled before playing\nit. Those songs made his chest fuzzy and sometimes the feelings would get\noverwhelming. But he didn\u2019t really mind. He liked the old music that made him\nthink of his new feelings.</p><p><b><i>I know a little bit about a lot of things</i></b></p><p><b><i>But I don\u2019t know enough about you</i></b></p><p><b><i>Just when I think you\u2019re mine</i></b></p><p><b><i>You try a different line</i></b></p><p><b><i>And baby what can I do</i></b></p><p>-</p><p>When TJ got to work, parents were barely starting to drop\noff their kids. Some of the little kids would give him hugs as they walked in.\nHe loved his job, and he knew that he\u2019d never get anything wrong. His manager\nand him split them in groups, and TJ started helping his little group of five\nwith their exercises. A while into work, one of the kids in his group pointed\nto the door and said, \u201cLook, TJ. Cyrus is here!\u201d All the other little kids in\nthe gym started saying choruses of \u2018hi Cyrus\u2019 and waving furiously at him.\nCyrus had a huge frown when he walked in that quickly faded when the kids all\nstarted going to him. TJ had noticed the frown on time to know something was\nup.</p><p>\u201cHey, Underdog,\u201d TJ told Cyrus as he approached him. </p><p>\u201cHey, TJ. Just dropping by,\u201d Cyrus said, carrying one of the\nyoungest kids in his arms. </p><p>\u201cCathy get down,\u201d TJ laughed as the little girl held tightly\nonto Cyrus. She gave TJ puppy eyes, but TJ saw right through them and shook his\nhead. \u201cCome on.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAwe snap,\u201d Cathy gave TJ an exaggerated frown before Cyrus\nput her back down on the floor. Cathy and the other kids went back to trying to\ndo their stretches when TJ nodded his head towards the matts.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s like you mind control them,\u201d Cyrus said, a small grin\non his face.</p><p>\u201cVampires can\u2019t control minds,\u201d TJ smirked then looked\ndirectly at Cyrus. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWrong?\u201d Cyrus seemed to jump. \u201cNothing\u2019s wrong. Everything\nis fine.\u201d Everything indeed, was not fine.</p><p>\u201cI might not know a lot about you, but I can tell when\nsomething is wrong,\u201d TJ said and looked at his watch. \u201cI have a break in like thirty\nminutes,\u201d he said, putting his hand on Cyrus shoulder. Cyrus breath hitched. \u201cDo\nyou think you can wait for me to talk about it?\u201d TJ then paused. \u201cOnly if you\nwant to talk about it, though.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus thought about it for a few seconds before saying, \u201cYeah,\nI\u2019ll just sit down for a bit.\u201d TJ nodded before letting go of Cyrus\u2019 shoulder\nand walking back to the kids to continue showing them other exercise. Cyrus\nwent to a chair in the corner, not wanting to touch his phone. He sat with his\narms crossed, his frown eventually turning into a small smile as he watched TJ teach\nthe kids how to do a handstand. Cyrus started laughing when the kids all\nknocked down TJ when he was in the middle of one. It was cute and it hurt Cyrus\nin the chest like a knife. Cyrus looked out the window to the park across the\nstreet and watched more people go by. There were dog walkers, joggers, more\nlittle kids, and the occasional couple. Cyrus grew worried that every couple\ngoing by could be Jonah and Andi. </p><p>The thirty minutes seemed to drag by until TJ eventually\nwent up to Cyrus and smiled at him. \u201cI have twenty minutes. Want to go to the\npark?\u201d Cyrus eyes at the kids who were all in a circle around who seemed to be\nTJ\u2019s boss, drinking a juice box and eating snacks. They were all staring back\nat them, giving him excited waves.</p><p>Cyrus waved back before standing up and saying, \u201cYeah, let\u2019s\ngo.\u201d Cyrus and TJ went across the street and sat at a bench that was only a minute\nwalk away.</p><p>\u201cSo do you want to tell me what\u2019s wrong or would you rather\nme tell you how Hotel Transylvania ends?\u201d TJ smirked, sitting down an inch away\nfrom Cyrus on the bench. </p><p>\u201cHanging out with Andi and Jonah by myself was a mistake,\u201d\nCyrus spilled. He didn\u2019t like Jonah anymore, and he wasn\u2019t jealous. There was\njust something there that made it look like they were both unhappy, but he\u2019d\nnever tell Andi. He didn\u2019t want her to think that he just wanted Jonah for\nhimself.</p><p>\u201cYou never look comfortable around Jonah,\u201d TJ said, making\nCyrus\u2019 eyes go wide. Was he that obvious? </p><p>Cyrus stuttered, \u201cWhat do you\u2026 what do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean you\u2019re fine around him, but it\u2019s never the same\nfeeling around Buffy and Andi. It\u2019s like you\u2019re watching out for something,\u201d TJ\nexplained, making Cyrus\u2019 mouth fall open. He had only watched out that he\nwouldn\u2019t catch feelings for him again. Of course, TJ was making that task a lot\neasier. \u201cIs there a chunk of the story that I\u2019m missing?\u201d <i>I only had a heart obliterating crush on him that made me want to fling\nmyself in the ocean, but other than that, not really.</i></p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you that part someday,\u201d Cyrus told him after a\nfew seconds of stiff silence. \u201cI promise.\u201d He wasn\u2019t ready to come out to TJ\nyet.</p><p>\u201cSounds good,\u201d TJ told him. \u201cNo need to promise. If it\ncomes, it comes.\u201d <i>It\u2019ll come out of the\ncloset one day</i> Cyrus bit his lip. \u201cWhy are you upset right now though?\nLike, the actual reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Cyrus started, \u201cthey started fighting while we were\nhanging out. I sort of just sat there not knowing what to do. They almost\ndragged me into, and I just stood up and left without saying anything. I just feel\nso bad leaving them because they\u2019re my friends, and I don\u2019t them to be\nfighting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCouples fight, and you shouldn\u2019t feel bad about other\npeople\u2019s problems,\u201d TJ told him, putting his arm around him. Cyrus didn\u2019t tense\nup for once. He had grown used to that part of TJ.</p><p>\u201cI know but Andi is my best friend and Jonah is her best\nfriend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer boyfriend,\u201d TJ emphasized. \u201cNot yours.\u201d A long time\nago, that would\u2019ve stung Cyrus. Today, that sentence lifted a weight off his\nshoulders.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Cyrus told him, already sounding better, \u201cI guess\nyou\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes I can be right, too,\u201d TJ smirked, gently bumping\nthe side of his head on the side of Cyrus\u2019 for half a second. </p><p>\u201cI hope they\u2019ll be fine by tonight though,\u201d Cyrus told him\napologetically. \u201cWe\u2019re throwing Andi a surprise party, and Buffy, Jonah, and I\nwere supposed to plan it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf Jonah can\u2019t pull through, hit me up,\u201d TJ told him with a\nsmile.</p><p>\u201cWill do either way,\u201d Cyrus turned to TJ who was already\nlooking at him. TJ and Cyrus stared at each other for another two seconds, TJ\neyeing the mole and Cyrus testing how fast he could count TJ\u2019s freckles before they\nboth bashfully turned away.</p><p><b><i>I read the latest news</i></b></p><p><b><i>No buttons on my shoes</i></b></p><p><b><i>But baby I&rsquo;m confused about you</i></b></p><p><b><i>You get me in a spin</i></b></p><p><b><i>Oh what a stew I&rsquo;m in</i></b></p><p><b><i>&lsquo;Cause I don&rsquo;t know enough about you</i></b></p><p>-</p><p>Monday during third period, TJ was furiously tapping his feet\non the floor. Nobody heard it over all the chatting that was going on as their\nteacher passed back their math test. It was the first chapter test of the year,\nand TJ knew he didn\u2019t do well. He was aiming for a C minus when he was studying\nwith Amber, but when he got the test in front of him, nothing made sense. The\nquestions seemed to be in a different language, as if someone had gotten words from\ndifferent magazines and clipped them together. He didn\u2019t know what most of the\nquestions were asking, and he had forgotten a few rules for factoring. He\nlooked over across the room at Cyrus who was sitting with Jonah and some other\nkids. Cyrus smiled at TJ, making TJ\u2019s tapping ease a little as he returned a\npolite head nod. When the teacher approached TJ, she wore a familiar look on\nher face. TJ knew that face of disappointment all too well, and he already assumed\nthe worst with she placed the test upside down on his desk. He took a deep\nbreath before flipping it upside down.</p><p><b>F</b></p><p><b>See me after school\nplease</b></p><p>Without saying anything, TJ crumbled up the paper and clutched\nit in his hand before storming out of the class. He heard Mrs. Pierson call\nafter him as the rest of the class fell silent, but he kept walking down the hall.\nHe pushed open the restroom door and saw two 6<sup>th</sup> graders in there. \u201cOut,\u201d\nhe boomed at them, making them jump and run out the door. TJ went to the corner\nof the restroom next to the hand dryer and sat down, test still clutched in his\nhand. He didn\u2019t realize how hard he was biting his lip when he tasted the blood\non his tongue. He wanted to kick everything and tear it all apart. He had tried\nso hard for that test, and it was worthless. When the door open, he yelled\nagain, \u201cOut!\u201d</p><p>\u201cTJ,\u201d Cyrus peaked his head in, \u201cit\u2019s me. Mrs. Pierson let\nme come. Can I come in?\u201d TJ felt his face get hot. He was embarrassed now. </p><p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d TJ mumbled. Cyrus took it as a yes and walked\nin, going to TJ\u2019s corner. When Cyrus bent down to sit, his head accidently knocked\ninto the air dryer button, making it turn on. TJ bust out laughing as Cyrus jumped\nin fear. \u201cBe careful, Cyrus.\u201d Cyrus hit the button again with the side of his fist\nto turn it off again, his face showing irritation. He looked down at TJ and his\nface softened up again when he remembered what he was there for. TJ wasn\u2019t\nlooking at him but rather, the crumbled up test in his hands. Cyrus sat down\nnext to him, this time being careful with the machine.</p><p>\u201cCan I see that?\u201d Cyrus pointed at TJ\u2019s closed hand.</p><p>\u201cThe paper or my hand?\u201d TJ asked, almost sourly.</p><p>\u201cTJ,\u201d Cyrus poked him in the stomach, making TJ jump more\ninto the corner. \u201cI\u2019m not here to make fun of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know but,\u201d TJ paused. He didn\u2019t have anything else to\nsay. \u201cThis is just embarrassing. I feel so stupid. I studied, I swear I did. I just\u2026\ncan\u2019t do it.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYes you can, TJ,\u201d Cyrus told him. \u201cYou\u2019re not stupid. We\nmight have just started being friends, and I don\u2019t know every little thing\nabout you, but I know you\u2019re smart. You just need to talk to Mrs. Pierson about\nyour dyscalculia and get a tutor that can work around it. You\u2019ll be fine. I\npromise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou make a lot of promises, don\u2019t you?\u201d TJ tilted his to\nlook at Cyrus, a sad and dead look in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d Cyrus said matter-of-factly, \u201cand I tend to keep all\nof them.\u201d TJ gave him half a smile that fell after a second. He put his test in\nCyrus\u2019 hand before looking away. Cyrus uncrumpled the paper and scanned it. \u201cSee.\nI\u2019m sure she\u2019s willing to help. Just go talk to her after school. I can go with\nyou if you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you care so much Cyrus?\u201d TJ asked him, a little too\nbitterly than what he usually spoke like. It was similar to the way he would\ntalking to Buffy when she first got on the team. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure you have a\npassing grade. You don\u2019t have to worry about my dumbass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, I tend to just shove my tests in my backpack and\nlook at them a week later when it doesn\u2019t hurt,\u201d Cyrus said. \u201cI like to live a\nlife in denial. So for now, I\u2019ll be in denial that you hate that I care about\nyou.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t hate it,\u201d TJ looked at him, a huge frown on his\nface. \u201cI\u2019m actually glad that you care. I just don\u2019t like it that you\u2019re seeing\nme like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think we\u2019ve seen each other however \u2018like this\u2019,\u201d Cyrus\nquote with his hands before handing TJ back his test, \u201cplenty of times.\u201d</p><p>TJ smiled for once, \u201cWe have, haven\u2019t we.\u201d TJ reached for\nhis phone and took off his phone case, confusing Cyrus for a second. TJ then\npulled out the polaroid with their silly faces and handed it to him. \u201cHere.\nSince I didn\u2019t get to see you this morning.\u201d Cyrus looked at the polaroid photo\nand smiled. </p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Cyrus told him softly. TJ was the first to\nstand up and reached out his hand to Cyrus to help him up. Cyrus took it, but\nhe still managed to stumble into him.</p><p>\u201cI got you,\u201d TJ said, holding Cyrus steady by the arms. </p><p>\u201cMe, too,\u201d Cyrus smiled at him as he planted his feet firmly\non the ground. Cyrus and TJ stared at each other for a moment and the next\nthing they knew, they were hugging.</p><p><b><i>You know I went to school</i></b></p><p><b><i>And I&rsquo;m nobody&rsquo;s fool</i></b></p><p><b><i>That is to say until I met you!</i></b></p><p><b><i>I know a little bit about a lot o&rsquo; things</i></b></p><p><b><i>But I don&rsquo;t know enough about you</i></b></p><p><b><i>I know a little bit about biology</i></b></p><p><b><i>And a little more about psychology</i></b></p><p><b><i>I&rsquo;m a little gem in geology</i></b></p><p><b><i>But I don&rsquo;t know enough about you</i></b></p><p><a href=\"https://lgbtyrus.tumblr.com/post/177784471299/tjs-playlist-chapter-4\">Next Chapter</a></p>",

We watched a movie and fell\nasleep. I understand if I\u2019m in trouble. I deserve to get in trouble.\u201d His mom\npulled away from the hug, but still had a firm grip on his shoulders.</p><p>She sighed and told him with a small smile, \u201cYou\u2019re not in\ntrouble. You just forgot to text me. I trust you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh thank goodness,\u201d Cyrus sighed in relief. \u201cI was really\nscared for a moment.\u201d</p><p>His mom let out a small laugh, \u201cJust don\u2019t let it happen\nagain.\u201d Cyrus nodded. \u201cAlso, call your friends. I think Buffy is more worried\nthan I am. Dinner is in the microwave. We ate without you, sorry.\u201d Cyrus gave\nher another hug before walking into the kitchen to get his dinner. When he sat\ndown at the table, he made sure to text TJ before he got his ear blown off by\nBuffy and forgot.</p><p><b>Cyrus: </b>Made\nit home alive and I\u2019m not grounded!!</p><p><b>TJ: </b>sounds\ngood underdog </p><p><b>TJ: </b>sorry\nI forgot to feed you</p><p><b>TJ: </b>I was\nthinking of ordering a pizza when I fell asleep</p><p><b>Cyrus: </b>don\u2019t\nworry about it.

I hung up the photo I\u2019m keeping\nalready. Oh by the way, Amber wanted me to send you this [img]</p><p>It was a picture of TJ and Cyrus sleeping on the couch\nearlier. TJ was slumped over, his head resting between Cyrus\u2019 shoulder and\nhead. They both had small content smiles on their faces. It was a peaceful\npicture. As Cyrus stared at the picture for a moment too long, his phone\nstarted ringing. It was Buffy asking to merge him in a video call. \u201cOh man,\u201d\nCyrus mumbled. He hesitated but answered anyways, already flinching before\nBuffy had a chance to say anything.</p><p>\u201cHey answered!\u201d he heard Andi say in delight. \u201cFinally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, guys,\u201d Cyrus smiled, waving his spoon in front of the\nscreen.</p><p>\u201cHey guys?\u201d Buffy scoffed. \u201cWe\u2019ve been worried sick! I\nthought TJ had gotten you killed or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re being dramatic, Buffy,\u201d Cyrus laughed. \u201cI just hung\nout at his place and forgot to tell my mom. Nothing bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why didn\u2019t you answer?\u201d Buffy frowned. \u201cWere you\nignoring us?\u201d Cyrus felt guilty now. He didn\u2019t realize there was still some\nnegative tension left between TJ and Buffy. He knew it was that because Andi\nseemed to be fine. Buffy was the one that if given the word, she\u2019d put a stake\nthrough TJ\u2019s heart for Cyrus without hesitation.</p><p>\u201cNo, no,\u201d Cyrus quickly shook his head. \u201cI swear I wasn\u2019t.\nWe fell asleep watching Hotel Transylvania.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHotel Transylvania?\u201d Andi giggled. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t too scary\nfor you?\u201d Cyrus smirked and shook his head. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still really sorry, though,\u201d Cyrus told them with an\napologetic expression. Buffy\u2019s angry expression fell off her face, turning into\na solemn one. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to worry you guys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Buffy finally told him after a pause. \u201cBut do it\nagain, and I\u2019ll put you both in a casket.\u201d She ended up letting out a snort, \u201cI\ncan\u2019t believe you went to TJ Kippen\u2019s house.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus thought about it for a second and said, \u201cMe either. I\nthink I\u2019m getting somewhere with our \u2018The Kippen\u2019s are Vampires\u2019 theory. Their\ndecoration? Completely gothic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe his parents were total goth kids in school and never\ngrew out of it,\u201d Andi laughed. \u201cBowie and Bex seem to still have punk rock in\ntheir veins.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably,\u201d Buffy said, \u201cor they\u2019re vampires. I\u2019d say let\u2019s\nput a stake through Amber\u2019s heart to see if she\u2019ll turn into a bat, but she\u2019s\ngrown on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPutting a steak through her heart would kill her,\u201d Andi\nsmiled and shook her head. \u201cJust ask her if you can have a glass of blood next\ntime we\u2019re at The Spoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re too mean, guys,\u201d Cyrus shook his head, not once his\nsmile falling off. He was eating, talking to his friends in their secluded\ntrio, and his heart was still a fluttering mess.</p><p>\u201cToo mean? To the Kippens?\u201d Buffy let out a fake laugh. \u201cWow.\nAmber Kippen. I really thought she was going to be Amber Fubergoobeld\u2019schnoppert\nto me my whole life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t deny that they\u2019ve changed a lot,\u201d Andi told them.\nShe stayed silent for a bit before saying, \u201cAmber apologized to me. Like.\nFully. I was past it, but it made me feel a lot better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s really good,\u201d Cyrus smiled widely. \u201cShe\u2019s the reason\nwe woke up in the first place. I might still be over there if she hadn\u2019t gotten\nhome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWasn\u2019t it their dad\u2019s birthday?\u201d Andi asked him. Cyrus\npaused. He had forgotten about that.</p><p>\u201cWell his parents weren\u2019t there,\u201d Cyrus told them, getting\nan itch to ask TJ.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you were left unsupervised with a vampire,\u201d\nBuffy shook her head, not realizing that there was something bothering the two.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Cyrus went along, \u201cit would\u2019ve been me and three\nvampires, so it wouldn\u2019t have had made the situation any better if we\u2019re being\ncompletely honest.\u201d Andi knew something Cyrus didn\u2019t, and it looked obvious. He\nwished he could make direct eye contact with her to get her to spill, but if it\ninvolved Amber, Cyrus had a feeling it was private. Amber had a lot of secrets\nand in their short-lived friendship, who knew how much Andi had learned. Cyrus took\nan initiative and said, \u201cI\u2019m going to text TJ real fast. Remember I can still\nhear you!\u201d </p><p>Cyrus went off screen from the video chat and went to text\nTJ. He couldn\u2019t help but smile big when he caught sight of the photo he had\nlast sent. \u201cYour camera is still on!\u201d Buffy chided. \u201cWhat are you smiling at\nlike a big goof?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll send it right now,\u201d Cyrus lied. He made a quick wish\nfor them to forget about it before go back to the video call app to turn off\nhis camera. He opened his texts with TJ once more and blocked out Buffy and\nAndi\u2019s side conversation as he tried to think of something to say.</p><p><b>Cyrus: </b>wow\nwe look good</p><p><b>Cyrus: </b>anyways\ndid you guys do anything for your dad\u2019s birthday??</p><p><b>TJ: </b>I\nprobably wont see him until tomorrow if I\u2019m being honest. I just found out my\nmom is staying in for another shift, so it\u2019s just Amber, Macaroni, and I for\nanother night.</p><p><b>Cyrus: </b>Macaroni???!</p><p><b>TJ: </b>we\nhave a cat. Kind of does his own thing in the streets but always comes back at\nnight. He doesn\u2019t like me very much so he only likes to be inside when Amber is\nhere. I think he knows who pays for the food and who forgets to fill up his\nwater bowl. </p><p><b>Cyrus: </b>I\ncan\u2019t believe you hid a whole cat from me</p><p><b>TJ: </b>I hid\nmy whole ass sister from you and you\u2019re mad about the cat gkjsfghjksdfgh</p><p><b>Cyrus: </b>my\nfeelings are hurt!!</p><p>\u201cYou still there, Cy?\u201d Andi asked. Cyrus switched back to\nlook at them and turned on his camera.</p><p>\u201cHey, hello,\u201d he waved his fingers. \u201cI\u2019ve done some\ninvestigating, and they will not be celebrating TJ\u2019s dad\u2019s birthday. It\u2019s just\nhim, Amber, and their cat Macaroni for the night. I don\u2019t know what to do with\nthis information now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe either,\u201d Andi frowned.</p><p>\u201cAmber didn\u2019t seem that bummed out from it,\u201d Buffy\ncommented. \u201cTJ was the one that looked a little weird when she said it beat her\nass.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus gasped, \u201cBuffy don\u2019t cuss.\u201d Buffy gave her camera a\nlook that told her she was holding back a \u201cfuck you\u201d, but she just turned it\ninto a playful eyeroll.</p><p>\u201cAnyways, I\u2019m sure the vamps are fine,\u201d Buffy reassured\nthem. Cyrus and Andi agreed before Buffy smirked, \u201cSo Cyrus. What were you\nsmiling at?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d Cyrus whispered.</p><p>-</p><p>TJ once again woke up at 2AM, but not at his own accord.\nAmber was shaking him. He felt something small crawl across his legs above the\nblankets heard Amber whispering. \u201cWhy do you whisper when you\u2019re trying to wake\nme up,\u201d TJ groaned, rubbing his eyes. \u201cWhat time is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo,\u201d Amber said, still whispering. \u201cCan I sleep with you?\nMom is on the phone with dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s home?\u201d TJ sat up. He scooted towards the wall to make\nroom for Amber to sit down.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s been home,\u201d Amber said as she crawled into the bed.\nShe held her knees up to her chest and rested her chin on top of them. \u201cI think\nshe got in trouble at work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh shit,\u201d TJ frowned. \u201cThat\u2019s not good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not good at all,\u201d Amber started crying. TJ put an\narm around her as her tears got into a flow. TJ tended to ignore everything\nthat went on with their parents, but Amber was the one that paid attention to\nit all. She was their messenger when the fights were horrendous, and she was\nthe one that got lashed on for trying to get them to stop. TJ didn\u2019t try\nanything because one, Amber wouldn\u2019t let him. Two, he was a coward. He would\njust plug in his earbuds and close his eyes until he was asleep. \u201cWhat are we\ngoing to do?\u201d she sobbed.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be okay,\u201d TJ assured her. \u201cWe have what GG left me if\nanything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Amber pulled away and shook her head. She started\nwiping her tears. She hated it when TJ saw her cry. \u201cThat\u2019s your money for\ncollege.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t go to college,\u201d TJ told her. \u201cI\u2019m stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re not, TJ,\u201d Amber lightly tugged his ears. \u201cYou\u2019re\nso so smart. Just because you don\u2019t know how to do equations, it doesn\u2019t mean\nyou don\u2019t know who the thirteenth president of the United States is.\u201d TJ bit\nhis lip.</p><p>\u201cIf she gets fired-,\u201d TJ started but Amber nudged him in the\nstomach, making him jump back a little.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think she got fired. She probably just won\u2019t get\novertime anymore. But still. Dad needs to land a job. Quick,\u201d she told him,\nshifting to hug her knees again.</p><p>\u201cDo you think we\u2019ll have to move towns?\u201d TJ asked her. He\nhad been afraid of that since their dad said he had to look at places out of\nShadyside. He had had three interviews so far.</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d Amber mumbled. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t want to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe either,\u201d TJ told her, looking up at his ceiling. He\ncouldn\u2019t see the picture, but he was staring right at the spot where he had his\npolaroid with Cyrus. He couldn\u2019t leave now. </p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Amber sighed and laid down, \u201cnight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNight,\u201d TJ mumbled. He didn\u2019t lay down though. He stayed\nsitting up, occasionally petting Macaroni who hated it when Amber moved. He\nwould let out little mews and rub his head into TJ\u2019s hand until he fell asleep\nagain. Amber was a crazy sleeper and often gave TJ bruises on his legs when she\nstayed in his bed. It wasn\u2019t too often, but when it did happen, he felt like\nthey got closer. It was why he couldn\u2019t get mad at her or pick on her like he\nused to. They had enough going on. TJ laid down, but he couldn\u2019t get his eyes\nclosed. He stared at the spot with the polaroid, songs stuck in his head until\nhe eventually was able to make out Cyrus\u2019 smile as the sunshine poured in\nthrough the windows.</p><p>He smiled back at it and fell asleep.</p><p>It was twelve in the afternoon when he woke up alone in bed.\nAmber and Macaroni were gone. The sun from the blinds was hitting him directly\nwhich meant that Amber had opened them for him. He liked basking in the sun. It\nfelt warm and safe as if sunshine could never hurt him.</p><p>He rolled over and reached for his phone. He had gotten a\nmessage from Cyrus at 9AM, saying good morning with the sunshine emoji. TJ\nsmiled at it and opened it.</p><p><b>TJ: </b>Good\nmorning underdog. I slept late today</p><p><b>Cyrus: </b>I\nunderstand. You deserve it!</p><p><b>TJ: </b>That\u2019s\nsweet of you to say</p><p><b>Cyrus: </b>what\nare the plans for today?</p><p><b>TJ: </b>I have\nwork at 2 today so that\u2019s going to be fun. u can drop by if you want</p><p><b>Cyrus: </b>I think\nI\u2019m hanging out with Jonah and Andi today around that time but if I manage to\nescape early, ill go by \ud83d\ude0a don\u2019t expect me to do anything tho. Im just\nthere to observe how Shadyside\u2019s vampire interacts with kids</p><p><b>Cyrus: </b>haha\nis that why you guys live in Shadyside. Because it\u2019s shady and there will be no\nsun</p><p><b>TJ: </b>oh\nhardy har har </p><p><b>TJ: </b>I\nactually lay in the sun every morning for a while so I think your vampire theory\nis dead</p><p><b>Cyrus: </b>you\u2019re\na fool TJ Kippen. Vampires never die.</p><p><b>TJ: </b>I\u2019m\ngoing to turn into a bat and fly away next time I see you I swear. </p><p><b>Cyrus: </b>well\nyou can\u2019t because I need my polaroid picture back</p><p><b>TJ: </b>you\ngot me there</p><p>TJ rolled out of bed and went to\nshower, playing music on his speaker. He didn\u2019t hear anyone else, so he assumed\neveryone else was out. Amber had said something about getting brunch with some\nfriends before work the night before, and he assumed his dad wasn\u2019t back yet. His\nmom was a different question and he didn\u2019t bother asking himself where she possibly\ncould have had gone. </p><p>He scrolled through his phone through his many playlists and\nsaw C.C.C.M. \u00a0He smiled before playing\nit. Those songs made his chest fuzzy and sometimes the feelings would get\noverwhelming. But he didn\u2019t really mind. He liked the old music that made him\nthink of his new feelings.</p><p><b><i>I know a little bit about a lot of things</i></b></p><p><b><i>But I don\u2019t know enough about you</i></b></p><p><b><i>Just when I think you\u2019re mine</i></b></p><p><b><i>You try a different line</i></b></p><p><b><i>And baby what can I do</i></b></p><p>-</p><p>When TJ got to work, parents were barely starting to drop\noff their kids. Some of the little kids would give him hugs as they walked in.\nHe loved his job, and he knew that he\u2019d never get anything wrong. His manager\nand him split them in groups, and TJ started helping his little group of five\nwith their exercises. A while into work, one of the kids in his group pointed\nto the door and said, \u201cLook, TJ. Cyrus is here!\u201d All the other little kids in\nthe gym started saying choruses of \u2018hi Cyrus\u2019 and waving furiously at him.\nCyrus had a huge frown when he walked in that quickly faded when the kids all\nstarted going to him. TJ had noticed the frown on time to know something was\nup.</p><p>\u201cHey, Underdog,\u201d TJ told Cyrus as he approached him. </p><p>\u201cHey, TJ. Just dropping by,\u201d Cyrus said, carrying one of the\nyoungest kids in his arms. </p><p>\u201cCathy get down,\u201d TJ laughed as the little girl held tightly\nonto Cyrus. She gave TJ puppy eyes, but TJ saw right through them and shook his\nhead. \u201cCome on.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAwe snap,\u201d Cathy gave TJ an exaggerated frown before Cyrus\nput her back down on the floor. Cathy and the other kids went back to trying to\ndo their stretches when TJ nodded his head towards the matts.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s like you mind control them,\u201d Cyrus said, a small grin\non his face.</p><p>\u201cVampires can\u2019t control minds,\u201d TJ smirked then looked\ndirectly at Cyrus. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWrong?\u201d Cyrus seemed to jump. \u201cNothing\u2019s wrong. Everything\nis fine.\u201d Everything indeed, was not fine.</p><p>\u201cI might not know a lot about you, but I can tell when\nsomething is wrong,\u201d TJ said and looked at his watch. \u201cI have a break in like thirty\nminutes,\u201d he said, putting his hand on Cyrus shoulder. Cyrus breath hitched. \u201cDo\nyou think you can wait for me to talk about it?\u201d TJ then paused. \u201cOnly if you\nwant to talk about it, though.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus thought about it for a few seconds before saying, \u201cYeah,\nI\u2019ll just sit down for a bit.\u201d TJ nodded before letting go of Cyrus\u2019 shoulder\nand walking back to the kids to continue showing them other exercise. Cyrus\nwent to a chair in the corner, not wanting to touch his phone. He sat with his\narms crossed, his frown eventually turning into a small smile as he watched TJ teach\nthe kids how to do a handstand. Cyrus started laughing when the kids all\nknocked down TJ when he was in the middle of one. It was cute and it hurt Cyrus\nin the chest like a knife. Cyrus looked out the window to the park across the\nstreet and watched more people go by. There were dog walkers, joggers, more\nlittle kids, and the occasional couple. Cyrus grew worried that every couple\ngoing by could be Jonah and Andi. </p><p>The thirty minutes seemed to drag by until TJ eventually\nwent up to Cyrus and smiled at him. \u201cI have twenty minutes. Want to go to the\npark?\u201d Cyrus eyes at the kids who were all in a circle around who seemed to be\nTJ\u2019s boss, drinking a juice box and eating snacks. They were all staring back\nat them, giving him excited waves.</p><p>Cyrus waved back before standing up and saying, \u201cYeah, let\u2019s\ngo.\u201d Cyrus and TJ went across the street and sat at a bench that was only a minute\nwalk away.</p><p>\u201cSo do you want to tell me what\u2019s wrong or would you rather\nme tell you how Hotel Transylvania ends?\u201d TJ smirked, sitting down an inch away\nfrom Cyrus on the bench. </p><p>\u201cHanging out with Andi and Jonah by myself was a mistake,\u201d\nCyrus spilled. He didn\u2019t like Jonah anymore, and he wasn\u2019t jealous. There was\njust something there that made it look like they were both unhappy, but he\u2019d\nnever tell Andi. He didn\u2019t want her to think that he just wanted Jonah for\nhimself.</p><p>\u201cYou never look comfortable around Jonah,\u201d TJ said, making\nCyrus\u2019 eyes go wide. Was he that obvious? </p><p>Cyrus stuttered, \u201cWhat do you\u2026 what do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean you\u2019re fine around him, but it\u2019s never the same\nfeeling around Buffy and Andi. It\u2019s like you\u2019re watching out for something,\u201d TJ\nexplained, making Cyrus\u2019 mouth fall open. He had only watched out that he\nwouldn\u2019t catch feelings for him again. Of course, TJ was making that task a lot\neasier. \u201cIs there a chunk of the story that I\u2019m missing?\u201d <i>I only had a heart obliterating crush on him that made me want to fling\nmyself in the ocean, but other than that, not really.</i></p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you that part someday,\u201d Cyrus told him after a\nfew seconds of stiff silence. \u201cI promise.\u201d He wasn\u2019t ready to come out to TJ\nyet.</p><p>\u201cSounds good,\u201d TJ told him. \u201cNo need to promise. If it\ncomes, it comes.\u201d <i>It\u2019ll come out of the\ncloset one day</i> Cyrus bit his lip. \u201cWhy are you upset right now though?\nLike, the actual reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Cyrus started, \u201cthey started fighting while we were\nhanging out. I sort of just sat there not knowing what to do. They almost\ndragged me into, and I just stood up and left without saying anything. I just feel\nso bad leaving them because they\u2019re my friends, and I don\u2019t them to be\nfighting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCouples fight, and you shouldn\u2019t feel bad about other\npeople\u2019s problems,\u201d TJ told him, putting his arm around him. Cyrus didn\u2019t tense\nup for once. He had grown used to that part of TJ.</p><p>\u201cI know but Andi is my best friend and Jonah is her best\nfriend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer boyfriend,\u201d TJ emphasized. \u201cNot yours.\u201d A long time\nago, that would\u2019ve stung Cyrus. Today, that sentence lifted a weight off his\nshoulders.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Cyrus told him, already sounding better, \u201cI guess\nyou\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes I can be right, too,\u201d TJ smirked, gently bumping\nthe side of his head on the side of Cyrus\u2019 for half a second. </p><p>\u201cI hope they\u2019ll be fine by tonight though,\u201d Cyrus told him\napologetically. \u201cWe\u2019re throwing Andi a surprise party, and Buffy, Jonah, and I\nwere supposed to plan it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf Jonah can\u2019t pull through, hit me up,\u201d TJ told him with a\nsmile.</p><p>\u201cWill do either way,\u201d Cyrus turned to TJ who was already\nlooking at him. TJ and Cyrus stared at each other for another two seconds, TJ\neyeing the mole and Cyrus testing how fast he could count TJ\u2019s freckles before they\nboth bashfully turned away.</p><p><b><i>I read the latest news</i></b></p><p><b><i>No buttons on my shoes</i></b></p><p><b><i>But baby I\u2019m confused about you</i></b></p><p><b><i>You get me in a spin</i></b></p><p><b><i>Oh what a stew I\u2019m in</i></b></p><p><b><i>\u2018Cause I don\u2019t know enough about you</i></b></p><p>-</p><p>Monday during third period, TJ was furiously tapping his feet\non the floor. Nobody heard it over all the chatting that was going on as their\nteacher passed back their math test. It was the first chapter test of the year,\nand TJ knew he didn\u2019t do well. He was aiming for a C minus when he was studying\nwith Amber, but when he got the test in front of him, nothing made sense. The\nquestions seemed to be in a different language, as if someone had gotten words from\ndifferent magazines and clipped them together. He didn\u2019t know what most of the\nquestions were asking, and he had forgotten a few rules for factoring. He\nlooked over across the room at Cyrus who was sitting with Jonah and some other\nkids. Cyrus smiled at TJ, making TJ\u2019s tapping ease a little as he returned a\npolite head nod. When the teacher approached TJ, she wore a familiar look on\nher face. TJ knew that face of disappointment all too well, and he already assumed\nthe worst with she placed the test upside down on his desk. He took a deep\nbreath before flipping it upside down.</p><p><b>F</b></p><p><b>See me after school\nplease</b></p><p>Without saying anything, TJ crumbled up the paper and clutched\nit in his hand before storming out of the class. He heard Mrs. Pierson call\nafter him as the rest of the class fell silent, but he kept walking down the hall.\nHe pushed open the restroom door and saw two 6<sup>th</sup> graders in there. \u201cOut,\u201d\nhe boomed at them, making them jump and run out the door. TJ went to the corner\nof the restroom next to the hand dryer and sat down, test still clutched in his\nhand. He didn\u2019t realize how hard he was biting his lip when he tasted the blood\non his tongue. He wanted to kick everything and tear it all apart. He had tried\nso hard for that test, and it was worthless. When the door open, he yelled\nagain, \u201cOut!\u201d</p><p>\u201cTJ,\u201d Cyrus peaked his head in, \u201cit\u2019s me. Mrs. Pierson let\nme come. Can I come in?\u201d TJ felt his face get hot. He was embarrassed now. </p><p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d TJ mumbled. Cyrus took it as a yes and walked\nin, going to TJ\u2019s corner. When Cyrus bent down to sit, his head accidently knocked\ninto the air dryer button, making it turn on. TJ bust out laughing as Cyrus jumped\nin fear. \u201cBe careful, Cyrus.\u201d Cyrus hit the button again with the side of his fist\nto turn it off again, his face showing irritation. He looked down at TJ and his\nface softened up again when he remembered what he was there for. TJ wasn\u2019t\nlooking at him but rather, the crumbled up test in his hands. Cyrus sat down\nnext to him, this time being careful with the machine.</p><p>\u201cCan I see that?\u201d Cyrus pointed at TJ\u2019s closed hand.</p><p>\u201cThe paper or my hand?\u201d TJ asked, almost sourly.</p><p>\u201cTJ,\u201d Cyrus poked him in the stomach, making TJ jump more\ninto the corner. \u201cI\u2019m not here to make fun of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know but,\u201d TJ paused. He didn\u2019t have anything else to\nsay. \u201cThis is just embarrassing. I feel so stupid. I studied, I swear I did. I just\u2026\ncan\u2019t do it.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYes you can, TJ,\u201d Cyrus told him. \u201cYou\u2019re not stupid. We\nmight have just started being friends, and I don\u2019t know every little thing\nabout you, but I know you\u2019re smart. You just need to talk to Mrs. Pierson about\nyour dyscalculia and get a tutor that can work around it. You\u2019ll be fine. I\npromise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou make a lot of promises, don\u2019t you?\u201d TJ tilted his to\nlook at Cyrus, a sad and dead look in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d Cyrus said matter-of-factly, \u201cand I tend to keep all\nof them.\u201d TJ gave him half a smile that fell after a second. He put his test in\nCyrus\u2019 hand before looking away. Cyrus uncrumpled the paper and scanned it. \u201cSee.\nI\u2019m sure she\u2019s willing to help. Just go talk to her after school. I can go with\nyou if you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you care so much Cyrus?\u201d TJ asked him, a little too\nbitterly than what he usually spoke like. It was similar to the way he would\ntalking to Buffy when she first got on the team. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure you have a\npassing grade. You don\u2019t have to worry about my dumbass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, I tend to just shove my tests in my backpack and\nlook at them a week later when it doesn\u2019t hurt,\u201d Cyrus said. \u201cI like to live a\nlife in denial. So for now, I\u2019ll be in denial that you hate that I care about\nyou.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t hate it,\u201d TJ looked at him, a huge frown on his\nface. \u201cI\u2019m actually glad that you care. I just don\u2019t like it that you\u2019re seeing\nme like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think we\u2019ve seen each other however \u2018like this\u2019,\u201d Cyrus\nquote with his hands before handing TJ back his test, \u201cplenty of times.\u201d</p><p>TJ smiled for once, \u201cWe have, haven\u2019t we.\u201d TJ reached for\nhis phone and took off his phone case, confusing Cyrus for a second. TJ then\npulled out the polaroid with their silly faces and handed it to him. \u201cHere.\nSince I didn\u2019t get to see you this morning.\u201d Cyrus looked at the polaroid photo\nand smiled. </p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Cyrus told him softly. TJ was the first to\nstand up and reached out his hand to Cyrus to help him up. Cyrus took it, but\nhe still managed to stumble into him.</p><p>\u201cI got you,\u201d TJ said, holding Cyrus steady by the arms. </p><p>\u201cMe, too,\u201d Cyrus smiled at him as he planted his feet firmly\non the ground. Cyrus and TJ stared at each other for a moment and the next\nthing they knew, they were hugging.</p><p><b><i>You know I went to school</i></b></p><p><b><i>And I\u2019m nobody\u2019s fool</i></b></p><p><b><i>That is to say until I met you!</i></b></p><p><b><i>I know a little bit about a lot o\u2019 things</i></b></p><p><b><i>But I don\u2019t know enough about you</i></b></p><p><b><i>I know a little bit about biology</i></b></p><p><b><i>And a little more about psychology</i></b></p><p><b><i>I\u2019m a little gem in geology</i></b></p><p><b><i>But I don\u2019t know enough about you</i></b></p><p><a href=\"https://lgbtyrus.tumblr.com/post/177784471299/tjs-playlist-chapter-4\">Next Chapter</a></p>",

TJ just wished Cyrus could realize that all of those songs remind him of a certain boy who likes chocolate chocolate chip muffins without telling him directly.</p><p>With insecurities and fears almost set in stone, it\u2019s hard for TJ to admit that he has a heart aching crush on Cyrus who is trying to avoid just that. Of course, it doesn\u2019t seem like both of them are trying to get over each other when they\u2019re always together.</p><p><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/15801564/chapters/36906042\">Ao3 Link</a>\u00a0|<a href=\"https://lgbtyrus.tumblr.com/post/177469568929/tjs-playlist-chapter-2\"> Previous Chapter</a></p><p><b>Words:</b> 4,627</p>[[MORE]]<p>Cyrus nervously walked inside his house, his mom and stepdad\nwaiting in the sitting room. \u201cH-ey, guys,\u201d Cyrus gave them a little wave, his\nvoice cracking. </p><p>\u201cWhere were you,\u201d his mom asked, running up to him to give\nhim a hug.</p><p>\u201cAround the block at a friend\u2019s house,\u201d Cyrus said, hugging\nhis mom back. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry I forgot to text. We watched a movie and fell\nasleep. I understand if I\u2019m in trouble. I deserve to get in trouble.\u201d His mom\npulled away from the hug, but still had a firm grip on his shoulders.</p><p>She sighed and told him with a small smile, \u201cYou\u2019re not in\ntrouble. You just forgot to text me. I trust you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh thank goodness,\u201d Cyrus sighed in relief. \u201cI was really\nscared for a moment.\u201d</p><p>His mom let out a small laugh, \u201cJust don\u2019t let it happen\nagain.\u201d Cyrus nodded. \u201cAlso, call your friends. I think Buffy is more worried\nthan I am. Dinner is in the microwave. We ate without you, sorry.\u201d Cyrus gave\nher another hug before walking into the kitchen to get his dinner. When he sat\ndown at the table, he made sure to text TJ before he got his ear blown off by\nBuffy and forgot.</p><p><b>Cyrus: </b>Made\nit home alive and I\u2019m not grounded!!</p><p><b>TJ: </b>sounds\ngood underdog </p><p><b>TJ: </b>sorry\nI forgot to feed you</p><p><b>TJ: </b>I was\nthinking of ordering a pizza when I fell asleep</p><p><b>Cyrus: </b>don\u2019t\nworry about it. Since I didn\u2019t get grounded, I\u2019m allowed to eat dinner.</p><p><b>Cyrus: </b>don\u2019t\ntake that seriously</p><p><b>TJ: </b>lol I\nwon\u2019t.</p><p><b>TJ: </b>you\nforgot your polaroid \u2639 I\u2019ll take it to you Monday at school okay?</p><p><b>Cyrus: </b>Just\nrealized that :o Ty!!</p><p><b>TJ: </b>yeah\nof course. It\u2019s nothing. After all, you risked going blind for those photos :P</p><p><b>Cyrus: </b>I\ncan\u2019t believe you really put my eye sight at risk for some photos</p><p><b>TJ: </b>hey,\nyou\u2019re the one that wanted to be on my ceiling. I hung up the photo I\u2019m keeping\nalready. Oh by the way, Amber wanted me to send you this [img]</p><p>It was a picture of TJ and Cyrus sleeping on the couch\nearlier. TJ was slumped over, his head resting between Cyrus\u2019 shoulder and\nhead. They both had small content smiles on their faces. It was a peaceful\npicture. As Cyrus stared at the picture for a moment too long, his phone\nstarted ringing. It was Buffy asking to merge him in a video call. \u201cOh man,\u201d\nCyrus mumbled. He hesitated but answered anyways, already flinching before\nBuffy had a chance to say anything.</p><p>\u201cHey answered!\u201d he heard Andi say in delight. \u201cFinally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, guys,\u201d Cyrus smiled, waving his spoon in front of the\nscreen.</p><p>\u201cHey guys?\u201d Buffy scoffed. \u201cWe\u2019ve been worried sick! I\nthought TJ had gotten you killed or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re being dramatic, Buffy,\u201d Cyrus laughed. \u201cI just hung\nout at his place and forgot to tell my mom. Nothing bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why didn\u2019t you answer?\u201d Buffy frowned. \u201cWere you\nignoring us?\u201d Cyrus felt guilty now. He didn\u2019t realize there was still some\nnegative tension left between TJ and Buffy. He knew it was that because Andi\nseemed to be fine. Buffy was the one that if given the word, she\u2019d put a stake\nthrough TJ\u2019s heart for Cyrus without hesitation.</p><p>\u201cNo, no,\u201d Cyrus quickly shook his head. \u201cI swear I wasn\u2019t.\nWe fell asleep watching Hotel Transylvania.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHotel Transylvania?\u201d Andi giggled. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t too scary\nfor you?\u201d Cyrus smirked and shook his head. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still really sorry, though,\u201d Cyrus told them with an\napologetic expression. Buffy\u2019s angry expression fell off her face, turning into\na solemn one. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to worry you guys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Buffy finally told him after a pause. \u201cBut do it\nagain, and I\u2019ll put you both in a casket.\u201d She ended up letting out a snort, \u201cI\ncan\u2019t believe you went to TJ Kippen\u2019s house.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus thought about it for a second and said, \u201cMe either. I\nthink I\u2019m getting somewhere with our \u2018The Kippen\u2019s are Vampires\u2019 theory. Their\ndecoration? Completely gothic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe his parents were total goth kids in school and never\ngrew out of it,\u201d Andi laughed. \u201cBowie and Bex seem to still have punk rock in\ntheir veins.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably,\u201d Buffy said, \u201cor they\u2019re vampires. I\u2019d say let\u2019s\nput a stake through Amber\u2019s heart to see if she\u2019ll turn into a bat, but she\u2019s\ngrown on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPutting a steak through her heart would kill her,\u201d Andi\nsmiled and shook her head. \u201cJust ask her if you can have a glass of blood next\ntime we\u2019re at The Spoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re too mean, guys,\u201d Cyrus shook his head, not once his\nsmile falling off. He was eating, talking to his friends in their secluded\ntrio, and his heart was still a fluttering mess.</p><p>\u201cToo mean? To the Kippens?\u201d Buffy let out a fake laugh. \u201cWow.\nAmber Kippen. I really thought she was going to be Amber Fubergoobeld\u2019schnoppert\nto me my whole life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t deny that they\u2019ve changed a lot,\u201d Andi told them.\nShe stayed silent for a bit before saying, \u201cAmber apologized to me. Like.\nFully. I was past it, but it made me feel a lot better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s really good,\u201d Cyrus smiled widely. \u201cShe\u2019s the reason\nwe woke up in the first place. I might still be over there if she hadn\u2019t gotten\nhome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWasn\u2019t it their dad\u2019s birthday?\u201d Andi asked him. Cyrus\npaused. He had forgotten about that.</p><p>\u201cWell his parents weren\u2019t there,\u201d Cyrus told them, getting\nan itch to ask TJ.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you were left unsupervised with a vampire,\u201d\nBuffy shook her head, not realizing that there was something bothering the two.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Cyrus went along, \u201cit would\u2019ve been me and three\nvampires, so it wouldn\u2019t have had made the situation any better if we\u2019re being\ncompletely honest.\u201d Andi knew something Cyrus didn\u2019t, and it looked obvious. He\nwished he could make direct eye contact with her to get her to spill, but if it\ninvolved Amber, Cyrus had a feeling it was private. Amber had a lot of secrets\nand in their short-lived friendship, who knew how much Andi had learned. Cyrus took\nan initiative and said, \u201cI\u2019m going to text TJ real fast. Remember I can still\nhear you!\u201d </p><p>Cyrus went off screen from the video chat and went to text\nTJ. He couldn\u2019t help but smile big when he caught sight of the photo he had\nlast sent. \u201cYour camera is still on!\u201d Buffy chided. \u201cWhat are you smiling at\nlike a big goof?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll send it right now,\u201d Cyrus lied. He made a quick wish\nfor them to forget about it before go back to the video call app to turn off\nhis camera. He opened his texts with TJ once more and blocked out Buffy and\nAndi\u2019s side conversation as he tried to think of something to say.</p><p><b>Cyrus: </b>wow\nwe look good</p><p><b>Cyrus: </b>anyways\ndid you guys do anything for your dad\u2019s birthday??</p><p><b>TJ: </b>I\nprobably wont see him until tomorrow if I\u2019m being honest. I just found out my\nmom is staying in for another shift, so it\u2019s just Amber, Macaroni, and I for\nanother night.</p><p><b>Cyrus: </b>Macaroni???!</p><p><b>TJ: </b>we\nhave a cat. Kind of does his own thing in the streets but always comes back at\nnight. He doesn\u2019t like me very much so he only likes to be inside when Amber is\nhere. I think he knows who pays for the food and who forgets to fill up his\nwater bowl. </p><p><b>Cyrus: </b>I\ncan\u2019t believe you hid a whole cat from me</p><p><b>TJ: </b>I hid\nmy whole ass sister from you and you\u2019re mad about the cat gkjsfghjksdfgh</p><p><b>Cyrus: </b>my\nfeelings are hurt!!</p><p>\u201cYou still there, Cy?\u201d Andi asked. Cyrus switched back to\nlook at them and turned on his camera.</p><p>\u201cHey, hello,\u201d he waved his fingers. \u201cI\u2019ve done some\ninvestigating, and they will not be celebrating TJ\u2019s dad\u2019s birthday. It\u2019s just\nhim, Amber, and their cat Macaroni for the night. I don\u2019t know what to do with\nthis information now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe either,\u201d Andi frowned.</p><p>\u201cAmber didn\u2019t seem that bummed out from it,\u201d Buffy\ncommented. \u201cTJ was the one that looked a little weird when she said it beat her\nass.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus gasped, \u201cBuffy don\u2019t cuss.\u201d Buffy gave her camera a\nlook that told her she was holding back a \u201cfuck you\u201d, but she just turned it\ninto a playful eyeroll.</p><p>\u201cAnyways, I\u2019m sure the vamps are fine,\u201d Buffy reassured\nthem. Cyrus and Andi agreed before Buffy smirked, \u201cSo Cyrus. What were you\nsmiling at?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d Cyrus whispered.</p><p>-</p><p>TJ once again woke up at 2AM, but not at his own accord.\nAmber was shaking him. He felt something small crawl across his legs above the\nblankets heard Amber whispering. \u201cWhy do you whisper when you\u2019re trying to wake\nme up,\u201d TJ groaned, rubbing his eyes. \u201cWhat time is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo,\u201d Amber said, still whispering. \u201cCan I sleep with you?\nMom is on the phone with dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s home?\u201d TJ sat up. He scooted towards the wall to make\nroom for Amber to sit down.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s been home,\u201d Amber said as she crawled into the bed.\nShe held her knees up to her chest and rested her chin on top of them. \u201cI think\nshe got in trouble at work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh shit,\u201d TJ frowned. \u201cThat\u2019s not good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not good at all,\u201d Amber started crying. TJ put an\narm around her as her tears got into a flow. TJ tended to ignore everything\nthat went on with their parents, but Amber was the one that paid attention to\nit all. She was their messenger when the fights were horrendous, and she was\nthe one that got lashed on for trying to get them to stop. TJ didn\u2019t try\nanything because one, Amber wouldn\u2019t let him. Two, he was a coward. He would\njust plug in his earbuds and close his eyes until he was asleep. \u201cWhat are we\ngoing to do?\u201d she sobbed.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be okay,\u201d TJ assured her. \u201cWe have what GG left me if\nanything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Amber pulled away and shook her head. She started\nwiping her tears. She hated it when TJ saw her cry. \u201cThat\u2019s your money for\ncollege.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t go to college,\u201d TJ told her. \u201cI\u2019m stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re not, TJ,\u201d Amber lightly tugged his ears. \u201cYou\u2019re\nso so smart. Just because you don\u2019t know how to do equations, it doesn\u2019t mean\nyou don\u2019t know who the thirteenth president of the United States is.\u201d TJ bit\nhis lip.</p><p>\u201cIf she gets fired-,\u201d TJ started but Amber nudged him in the\nstomach, making him jump back a little.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think she got fired. She probably just won\u2019t get\novertime anymore. But still. Dad needs to land a job. Quick,\u201d she told him,\nshifting to hug her knees again.</p><p>\u201cDo you think we\u2019ll have to move towns?\u201d TJ asked her. He\nhad been afraid of that since their dad said he had to look at places out of\nShadyside. He had had three interviews so far.</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d Amber mumbled. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t want to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe either,\u201d TJ told her, looking up at his ceiling. He\ncouldn\u2019t see the picture, but he was staring right at the spot where he had his\npolaroid with Cyrus. He couldn\u2019t leave now. </p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Amber sighed and laid down, \u201cnight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNight,\u201d TJ mumbled. He didn\u2019t lay down though. He stayed\nsitting up, occasionally petting Macaroni who hated it when Amber moved. He\nwould let out little mews and rub his head into TJ\u2019s hand until he fell asleep\nagain. Amber was a crazy sleeper and often gave TJ bruises on his legs when she\nstayed in his bed. It wasn\u2019t too often, but when it did happen, he felt like\nthey got closer. It was why he couldn\u2019t get mad at her or pick on her like he\nused to. They had enough going on. TJ laid down, but he couldn\u2019t get his eyes\nclosed. He stared at the spot with the polaroid, songs stuck in his head until\nhe eventually was able to make out Cyrus\u2019 smile as the sunshine poured in\nthrough the windows.</p><p>He smiled back at it and fell asleep.</p><p>It was twelve in the afternoon when he woke up alone in bed.\nAmber and Macaroni were gone. The sun from the blinds was hitting him directly\nwhich meant that Amber had opened them for him. He liked basking in the sun. It\nfelt warm and safe as if sunshine could never hurt him.</p><p>He rolled over and reached for his phone. He had gotten a\nmessage from Cyrus at 9AM, saying good morning with the sunshine emoji. TJ\nsmiled at it and opened it.</p><p><b>TJ: </b>Good\nmorning underdog. I slept late today</p><p><b>Cyrus: </b>I\nunderstand. You deserve it!</p><p><b>TJ: </b>That\u2019s\nsweet of you to say</p><p><b>Cyrus: </b>what\nare the plans for today?</p><p><b>TJ: </b>I have\nwork at 2 today so that\u2019s going to be fun. u can drop by if you want</p><p><b>Cyrus: </b>I think\nI\u2019m hanging out with Jonah and Andi today around that time but if I manage to\nescape early, ill go by \ud83d\ude0a don\u2019t expect me to do anything tho. Im just\nthere to observe how Shadyside\u2019s vampire interacts with kids</p><p><b>Cyrus: </b>haha\nis that why you guys live in Shadyside. Because it\u2019s shady and there will be no\nsun</p><p><b>TJ: </b>oh\nhardy har har </p><p><b>TJ: </b>I\nactually lay in the sun every morning for a while so I think your vampire theory\nis dead</p><p><b>Cyrus: </b>you\u2019re\na fool TJ Kippen. Vampires never die.</p><p><b>TJ: </b>I\u2019m\ngoing to turn into a bat and fly away next time I see you I swear. </p><p><b>Cyrus: </b>well\nyou can\u2019t because I need my polaroid picture back</p><p><b>TJ: </b>you\ngot me there</p><p>TJ rolled out of bed and went to\nshower, playing music on his speaker. He didn\u2019t hear anyone else, so he assumed\neveryone else was out. Amber had said something about getting brunch with some\nfriends before work the night before, and he assumed his dad wasn\u2019t back yet. His\nmom was a different question and he didn\u2019t bother asking himself where she possibly\ncould have had gone. </p><p>He scrolled through his phone through his many playlists and\nsaw C.C.C.M. \u00a0He smiled before playing\nit. Those songs made his chest fuzzy and sometimes the feelings would get\noverwhelming. But he didn\u2019t really mind. He liked the old music that made him\nthink of his new feelings.</p><p><b><i>I know a little bit about a lot of things</i></b></p><p><b><i>But I don\u2019t know enough about you</i></b></p><p><b><i>Just when I think you\u2019re mine</i></b></p><p><b><i>You try a different line</i></b></p><p><b><i>And baby what can I do</i></b></p><p>-</p><p>When TJ got to work, parents were barely starting to drop\noff their kids. Some of the little kids would give him hugs as they walked in.\nHe loved his job, and he knew that he\u2019d never get anything wrong. His manager\nand him split them in groups, and TJ started helping his little group of five\nwith their exercises. A while into work, one of the kids in his group pointed\nto the door and said, \u201cLook, TJ. Cyrus is here!\u201d All the other little kids in\nthe gym started saying choruses of \u2018hi Cyrus\u2019 and waving furiously at him.\nCyrus had a huge frown when he walked in that quickly faded when the kids all\nstarted going to him. TJ had noticed the frown on time to know something was\nup.</p><p>\u201cHey, Underdog,\u201d TJ told Cyrus as he approached him. </p><p>\u201cHey, TJ. Just dropping by,\u201d Cyrus said, carrying one of the\nyoungest kids in his arms. </p><p>\u201cCathy get down,\u201d TJ laughed as the little girl held tightly\nonto Cyrus. She gave TJ puppy eyes, but TJ saw right through them and shook his\nhead. \u201cCome on.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAwe snap,\u201d Cathy gave TJ an exaggerated frown before Cyrus\nput her back down on the floor. Cathy and the other kids went back to trying to\ndo their stretches when TJ nodded his head towards the matts.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s like you mind control them,\u201d Cyrus said, a small grin\non his face.</p><p>\u201cVampires can\u2019t control minds,\u201d TJ smirked then looked\ndirectly at Cyrus. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWrong?\u201d Cyrus seemed to jump. \u201cNothing\u2019s wrong. Everything\nis fine.\u201d Everything indeed, was not fine.</p><p>\u201cI might not know a lot about you, but I can tell when\nsomething is wrong,\u201d TJ said and looked at his watch. \u201cI have a break in like thirty\nminutes,\u201d he said, putting his hand on Cyrus shoulder. Cyrus breath hitched. \u201cDo\nyou think you can wait for me to talk about it?\u201d TJ then paused. \u201cOnly if you\nwant to talk about it, though.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus thought about it for a few seconds before saying, \u201cYeah,\nI\u2019ll just sit down for a bit.\u201d TJ nodded before letting go of Cyrus\u2019 shoulder\nand walking back to the kids to continue showing them other exercise. Cyrus\nwent to a chair in the corner, not wanting to touch his phone. He sat with his\narms crossed, his frown eventually turning into a small smile as he watched TJ teach\nthe kids how to do a handstand. Cyrus started laughing when the kids all\nknocked down TJ when he was in the middle of one. It was cute and it hurt Cyrus\nin the chest like a knife. Cyrus looked out the window to the park across the\nstreet and watched more people go by. There were dog walkers, joggers, more\nlittle kids, and the occasional couple. Cyrus grew worried that every couple\ngoing by could be Jonah and Andi. </p><p>The thirty minutes seemed to drag by until TJ eventually\nwent up to Cyrus and smiled at him. \u201cI have twenty minutes. Want to go to the\npark?\u201d Cyrus eyes at the kids who were all in a circle around who seemed to be\nTJ\u2019s boss, drinking a juice box and eating snacks. They were all staring back\nat them, giving him excited waves.</p><p>Cyrus waved back before standing up and saying, \u201cYeah, let\u2019s\ngo.\u201d Cyrus and TJ went across the street and sat at a bench that was only a minute\nwalk away.</p><p>\u201cSo do you want to tell me what\u2019s wrong or would you rather\nme tell you how Hotel Transylvania ends?\u201d TJ smirked, sitting down an inch away\nfrom Cyrus on the bench. </p><p>\u201cHanging out with Andi and Jonah by myself was a mistake,\u201d\nCyrus spilled. He didn\u2019t like Jonah anymore, and he wasn\u2019t jealous. There was\njust something there that made it look like they were both unhappy, but he\u2019d\nnever tell Andi. He didn\u2019t want her to think that he just wanted Jonah for\nhimself.</p><p>\u201cYou never look comfortable around Jonah,\u201d TJ said, making\nCyrus\u2019 eyes go wide. Was he that obvious? </p><p>Cyrus stuttered, \u201cWhat do you\u2026 what do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean you\u2019re fine around him, but it\u2019s never the same\nfeeling around Buffy and Andi. It\u2019s like you\u2019re watching out for something,\u201d TJ\nexplained, making Cyrus\u2019 mouth fall open. He had only watched out that he\nwouldn\u2019t catch feelings for him again. Of course, TJ was making that task a lot\neasier. \u201cIs there a chunk of the story that I\u2019m missing?\u201d <i>I only had a heart obliterating crush on him that made me want to fling\nmyself in the ocean, but other than that, not really.</i></p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you that part someday,\u201d Cyrus told him after a\nfew seconds of stiff silence. \u201cI promise.\u201d He wasn\u2019t ready to come out to TJ\nyet.</p><p>\u201cSounds good,\u201d TJ told him. \u201cNo need to promise. If it\ncomes, it comes.\u201d <i>It\u2019ll come out of the\ncloset one day</i> Cyrus bit his lip. \u201cWhy are you upset right now though?\nLike, the actual reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Cyrus started, \u201cthey started fighting while we were\nhanging out. I sort of just sat there not knowing what to do. They almost\ndragged me into, and I just stood up and left without saying anything. I just feel\nso bad leaving them because they\u2019re my friends, and I don\u2019t them to be\nfighting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCouples fight, and you shouldn\u2019t feel bad about other\npeople\u2019s problems,\u201d TJ told him, putting his arm around him. Cyrus didn\u2019t tense\nup for once. He had grown used to that part of TJ.</p><p>\u201cI know but Andi is my best friend and Jonah is her best\nfriend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer boyfriend,\u201d TJ emphasized. \u201cNot yours.\u201d A long time\nago, that would\u2019ve stung Cyrus. Today, that sentence lifted a weight off his\nshoulders.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Cyrus told him, already sounding better, \u201cI guess\nyou\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes I can be right, too,\u201d TJ smirked, gently bumping\nthe side of his head on the side of Cyrus\u2019 for half a second. </p><p>\u201cI hope they\u2019ll be fine by tonight though,\u201d Cyrus told him\napologetically. \u201cWe\u2019re throwing Andi a surprise party, and Buffy, Jonah, and I\nwere supposed to plan it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf Jonah can\u2019t pull through, hit me up,\u201d TJ told him with a\nsmile.</p><p>\u201cWill do either way,\u201d Cyrus turned to TJ who was already\nlooking at him. TJ and Cyrus stared at each other for another two seconds, TJ\neyeing the mole and Cyrus testing how fast he could count TJ\u2019s freckles before they\nboth bashfully turned away.</p><p><b><i>I read the latest news</i></b></p><p><b><i>No buttons on my shoes</i></b></p><p><b><i>But baby I\u2019m confused about you</i></b></p><p><b><i>You get me in a spin</i></b></p><p><b><i>Oh what a stew I\u2019m in</i></b></p><p><b><i>\u2018Cause I don\u2019t know enough about you</i></b></p><p>-</p><p>Monday during third period, TJ was furiously tapping his feet\non the floor. Nobody heard it over all the chatting that was going on as their\nteacher passed back their math test. It was the first chapter test of the year,\nand TJ knew he didn\u2019t do well. He was aiming for a C minus when he was studying\nwith Amber, but when he got the test in front of him, nothing made sense. The\nquestions seemed to be in a different language, as if someone had gotten words from\ndifferent magazines and clipped them together. He didn\u2019t know what most of the\nquestions were asking, and he had forgotten a few rules for factoring. He\nlooked over across the room at Cyrus who was sitting with Jonah and some other\nkids. Cyrus smiled at TJ, making TJ\u2019s tapping ease a little as he returned a\npolite head nod. When the teacher approached TJ, she wore a familiar look on\nher face. TJ knew that face of disappointment all too well, and he already assumed\nthe worst with she placed the test upside down on his desk. He took a deep\nbreath before flipping it upside down.</p><p><b>F</b></p><p><b>See me after school\nplease</b></p><p>Without saying anything, TJ crumbled up the paper and clutched\nit in his hand before storming out of the class. He heard Mrs. Pierson call\nafter him as the rest of the class fell silent, but he kept walking down the hall.\nHe pushed open the restroom door and saw two 6<sup>th</sup> graders in there. \u201cOut,\u201d\nhe boomed at them, making them jump and run out the door. TJ went to the corner\nof the restroom next to the hand dryer and sat down, test still clutched in his\nhand. He didn\u2019t realize how hard he was biting his lip when he tasted the blood\non his tongue. He wanted to kick everything and tear it all apart. He had tried\nso hard for that test, and it was worthless. When the door open, he yelled\nagain, \u201cOut!\u201d</p><p>\u201cTJ,\u201d Cyrus peaked his head in, \u201cit\u2019s me. Mrs. Pierson let\nme come. Can I come in?\u201d TJ felt his face get hot. He was embarrassed now. </p><p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d TJ mumbled. Cyrus took it as a yes and walked\nin, going to TJ\u2019s corner. When Cyrus bent down to sit, his head accidently knocked\ninto the air dryer button, making it turn on. TJ bust out laughing as Cyrus jumped\nin fear. \u201cBe careful, Cyrus.\u201d Cyrus hit the button again with the side of his fist\nto turn it off again, his face showing irritation. He looked down at TJ and his\nface softened up again when he remembered what he was there for. TJ wasn\u2019t\nlooking at him but rather, the crumbled up test in his hands. Cyrus sat down\nnext to him, this time being careful with the machine.</p><p>\u201cCan I see that?\u201d Cyrus pointed at TJ\u2019s closed hand.</p><p>\u201cThe paper or my hand?\u201d TJ asked, almost sourly.</p><p>\u201cTJ,\u201d Cyrus poked him in the stomach, making TJ jump more\ninto the corner. \u201cI\u2019m not here to make fun of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know but,\u201d TJ paused. He didn\u2019t have anything else to\nsay. \u201cThis is just embarrassing. I feel so stupid. I studied, I swear I did. I just\u2026\ncan\u2019t do it.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYes you can, TJ,\u201d Cyrus told him. \u201cYou\u2019re not stupid. We\nmight have just started being friends, and I don\u2019t know every little thing\nabout you, but I know you\u2019re smart. You just need to talk to Mrs. Pierson about\nyour dyscalculia and get a tutor that can work around it. You\u2019ll be fine. I\npromise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou make a lot of promises, don\u2019t you?\u201d TJ tilted his to\nlook at Cyrus, a sad and dead look in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d Cyrus said matter-of-factly, \u201cand I tend to keep all\nof them.\u201d TJ gave him half a smile that fell after a second. He put his test in\nCyrus\u2019 hand before looking away. Cyrus uncrumpled the paper and scanned it. \u201cSee.\nI\u2019m sure she\u2019s willing to help. Just go talk to her after school. I can go with\nyou if you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you care so much Cyrus?\u201d TJ asked him, a little too\nbitterly than what he usually spoke like. It was similar to the way he would\ntalking to Buffy when she first got on the team. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure you have a\npassing grade. You don\u2019t have to worry about my dumbass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, I tend to just shove my tests in my backpack and\nlook at them a week later when it doesn\u2019t hurt,\u201d Cyrus said. \u201cI like to live a\nlife in denial. So for now, I\u2019ll be in denial that you hate that I care about\nyou.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t hate it,\u201d TJ looked at him, a huge frown on his\nface. \u201cI\u2019m actually glad that you care. I just don\u2019t like it that you\u2019re seeing\nme like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think we\u2019ve seen each other however \u2018like this\u2019,\u201d Cyrus\nquote with his hands before handing TJ back his test, \u201cplenty of times.\u201d</p><p>TJ smiled for once, \u201cWe have, haven\u2019t we.\u201d TJ reached for\nhis phone and took off his phone case, confusing Cyrus for a second. TJ then\npulled out the polaroid with their silly faces and handed it to him. \u201cHere.\nSince I didn\u2019t get to see you this morning.\u201d Cyrus looked at the polaroid photo\nand smiled. </p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Cyrus told him softly. TJ was the first to\nstand up and reached out his hand to Cyrus to help him up. Cyrus took it, but\nhe still managed to stumble into him.</p><p>\u201cI got you,\u201d TJ said, holding Cyrus steady by the arms. </p><p>\u201cMe, too,\u201d Cyrus smiled at him as he planted his feet firmly\non the ground. Cyrus and TJ stared at each other for a moment and the next\nthing they knew, they were hugging.</p><p><b><i>You know I went to school</i></b></p><p><b><i>And I\u2019m nobody\u2019s fool</i></b></p><p><b><i>That is to say until I met you!</i></b></p><p><b><i>I know a little bit about a lot o\u2019 things</i></b></p><p><b><i>But I don\u2019t know enough about you</i></b></p><p><b><i>I know a little bit about biology</i></b></p><p><b><i>And a little more about psychology</i></b></p><p><b><i>I\u2019m a little gem in geology</i></b></p><p><b><i>But I don\u2019t know enough about you</i></b></p><p><a href=\"https://lgbtyrus.tumblr.com/post/177784471299/tjs-playlist-chapter-4\">Next Chapter</a></p>",
                "content": "<p><b>Story Summary:</b> When Cyrus finds a playlist on TJ&rsquo;s desktop full of old love songs, he realizes that TJ has never been a scary basketball guy but rather a huge sap. TJ just wished Cyrus could realize that all of those songs remind him of a certain boy who likes chocolate chocolate chip muffins without telling him directly.</p><p>With insecurities and fears almost set in stone, it&rsquo;s hard for TJ to admit that he has a heart aching crush on Cyrus who is trying to avoid just that. Of course, it doesn&rsquo;t seem like both of them are trying to get over each other when they&rsquo;re always together.</p><p><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/15801564/chapters/36906042\">Ao3 Link</a>&nbsp;|<a href=\"https://lgbtyrus.tumblr.com/post/177469568929/tjs-playlist-chapter-2\"> Previous Chapter</a></p><p><b>Words:</b> 4,627</p><p>Cyrus nervously walked inside his house, his mom and stepdad\nwaiting in the sitting room. &ldquo;H-ey, guys,&rdquo; Cyrus gave them a little wave, his\nvoice cracking. </p><p>&ldquo;Where were you,&rdquo; his mom asked, running up to him to give\nhim a hug.</p><p>&ldquo;Around the block at a friend&rsquo;s house,&rdquo; Cyrus said, hugging\nhis mom back. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry I forgot to text. We watched a movie and fell\nasleep. I understand if I&rsquo;m in trouble. I deserve to get in trouble.&rdquo; His mom\npulled away from the hug, but still had a firm grip on his shoulders.</p><p>She sighed and told him with a small smile, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not in\ntrouble. You just forgot to text me. I trust you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh thank goodness,&rdquo; Cyrus sighed in relief. &ldquo;I was really\nscared for a moment.&rdquo;</p><p>His mom let out a small laugh, &ldquo;Just don&rsquo;t let it happen\nagain.&rdquo; Cyrus nodded. &ldquo;Also, call your friends. I think Buffy is more worried\nthan I am. Dinner is in the microwave. We ate without you, sorry.&rdquo; Cyrus gave\nher another hug before walking into the kitchen to get his dinner. When he sat\ndown at the table, he made sure to text TJ before he got his ear blown off by\nBuffy and forgot.</p><p><b>Cyrus: </b>Made\nit home alive and I&rsquo;m not grounded!!</p><p><b>TJ: </b>sounds\ngood underdog </p><p><b>TJ: </b>sorry\nI forgot to feed you</p><p><b>TJ: </b>I was\nthinking of ordering a pizza when I fell asleep</p><p><b>Cyrus: </b>don&rsquo;t\nworry about it.

I hung up the photo I&rsquo;m keeping\nalready. Oh by the way, Amber wanted me to send you this [img]</p><p>It was a picture of TJ and Cyrus sleeping on the couch\nearlier. TJ was slumped over, his head resting between Cyrus&rsquo; shoulder and\nhead. They both had small content smiles on their faces. It was a peaceful\npicture. As Cyrus stared at the picture for a moment too long, his phone\nstarted ringing. It was Buffy asking to merge him in a video call. &ldquo;Oh man,&rdquo;\nCyrus mumbled. He hesitated but answered anyways, already flinching before\nBuffy had a chance to say anything.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey answered!&rdquo; he heard Andi say in delight. &ldquo;Finally.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, guys,&rdquo; Cyrus smiled, waving his spoon in front of the\nscreen.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey guys?&rdquo; Buffy scoffed. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been worried sick! I\nthought TJ had gotten you killed or something.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re being dramatic, Buffy,&rdquo; Cyrus laughed. &ldquo;I just hung\nout at his place and forgot to tell my mom. Nothing bad.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then why didn&rsquo;t you answer?&rdquo; Buffy frowned. &ldquo;Were you\nignoring us?&rdquo; Cyrus felt guilty now. He didn&rsquo;t realize there was still some\nnegative tension left between TJ and Buffy. He knew it was that because Andi\nseemed to be fine. Buffy was the one that if given the word, she&rsquo;d put a stake\nthrough TJ&rsquo;s heart for Cyrus without hesitation.</p><p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; Cyrus quickly shook his head. &ldquo;I swear I wasn&rsquo;t.\nWe fell asleep watching Hotel Transylvania.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hotel Transylvania?&rdquo; Andi giggled. &ldquo;That wasn&rsquo;t too scary\nfor you?&rdquo; Cyrus smirked and shook his head. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m still really sorry, though,&rdquo; Cyrus told them with an\napologetic expression. Buffy&rsquo;s angry expression fell off her face, turning into\na solemn one. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to worry you guys.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; Buffy finally told him after a pause. &ldquo;But do it\nagain, and I&rsquo;ll put you both in a casket.&rdquo; She ended up letting out a snort, &ldquo;I\ncan&rsquo;t believe you went to TJ Kippen&rsquo;s house.&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus thought about it for a second and said, &ldquo;Me either. I\nthink I&rsquo;m getting somewhere with our &lsquo;The Kippen&rsquo;s are Vampires&rsquo; theory. Their\ndecoration? Completely gothic.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Maybe his parents were total goth kids in school and never\ngrew out of it,&rdquo; Andi laughed. &ldquo;Bowie and Bex seem to still have punk rock in\ntheir veins.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Probably,&rdquo; Buffy said, &ldquo;or they&rsquo;re vampires. I&rsquo;d say let&rsquo;s\nput a stake through Amber&rsquo;s heart to see if she&rsquo;ll turn into a bat, but she&rsquo;s\ngrown on me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Putting a steak through her heart would kill her,&rdquo; Andi\nsmiled and shook her head. &ldquo;Just ask her if you can have a glass of blood next\ntime we&rsquo;re at The Spoon.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re too mean, guys,&rdquo; Cyrus shook his head, not once his\nsmile falling off. He was eating, talking to his friends in their secluded\ntrio, and his heart was still a fluttering mess.</p><p>&ldquo;Too mean? To the Kippens?&rdquo; Buffy let out a fake laugh. &ldquo;Wow.\nAmber Kippen. I really thought she was going to be Amber Fubergoobeld&rsquo;schnoppert\nto me my whole life.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t deny that they&rsquo;ve changed a lot,&rdquo; Andi told them.\nShe stayed silent for a bit before saying, &ldquo;Amber apologized to me. Like.\nFully. I was past it, but it made me feel a lot better.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s really good,&rdquo; Cyrus smiled widely. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s the reason\nwe woke up in the first place. I might still be over there if she hadn&rsquo;t gotten\nhome.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t it their dad&rsquo;s birthday?&rdquo; Andi asked him. Cyrus\npaused. He had forgotten about that.</p><p>&ldquo;Well his parents weren&rsquo;t there,&rdquo; Cyrus told them, getting\nan itch to ask TJ.</p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe you were left unsupervised with a vampire,&rdquo;\nBuffy shook her head, not realizing that there was something bothering the two.</p><p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Cyrus went along, &ldquo;it would&rsquo;ve been me and three\nvampires, so it wouldn&rsquo;t have had made the situation any better if we&rsquo;re being\ncompletely honest.&rdquo; Andi knew something Cyrus didn&rsquo;t, and it looked obvious. He\nwished he could make direct eye contact with her to get her to spill, but if it\ninvolved Amber, Cyrus had a feeling it was private. Amber had a lot of secrets\nand in their short-lived friendship, who knew how much Andi had learned. Cyrus took\nan initiative and said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to text TJ real fast. Remember I can still\nhear you!&rdquo; </p><p>Cyrus went off screen from the video chat and went to text\nTJ. He couldn&rsquo;t help but smile big when he caught sight of the photo he had\nlast sent. &ldquo;Your camera is still on!&rdquo; Buffy chided. &ldquo;What are you smiling at\nlike a big goof?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll send it right now,&rdquo; Cyrus lied. He made a quick wish\nfor them to forget about it before go back to the video call app to turn off\nhis camera. He opened his texts with TJ once more and blocked out Buffy and\nAndi&rsquo;s side conversation as he tried to think of something to say.</p><p><b>Cyrus: </b>wow\nwe look good</p><p><b>Cyrus: </b>anyways\ndid you guys do anything for your dad&rsquo;s birthday??</p><p><b>TJ: </b>I\nprobably wont see him until tomorrow if I&rsquo;m being honest. I just found out my\nmom is staying in for another shift, so it&rsquo;s just Amber, Macaroni, and I for\nanother night.</p><p><b>Cyrus: </b>Macaroni???!</p><p><b>TJ: </b>we\nhave a cat. Kind of does his own thing in the streets but always comes back at\nnight. He doesn&rsquo;t like me very much so he only likes to be inside when Amber is\nhere. I think he knows who pays for the food and who forgets to fill up his\nwater bowl. </p><p><b>Cyrus: </b>I\ncan&rsquo;t believe you hid a whole cat from me</p><p><b>TJ: </b>I hid\nmy whole ass sister from you and you&rsquo;re mad about the cat gkjsfghjksdfgh</p><p><b>Cyrus: </b>my\nfeelings are hurt!!</p><p>&ldquo;You still there, Cy?&rdquo; Andi asked. Cyrus switched back to\nlook at them and turned on his camera.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, hello,&rdquo; he waved his fingers. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve done some\ninvestigating, and they will not be celebrating TJ&rsquo;s dad&rsquo;s birthday. It&rsquo;s just\nhim, Amber, and their cat Macaroni for the night. I don&rsquo;t know what to do with\nthis information now.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Me either,&rdquo; Andi frowned.</p><p>&ldquo;Amber didn&rsquo;t seem that bummed out from it,&rdquo; Buffy\ncommented. &ldquo;TJ was the one that looked a little weird when she said it beat her\nass.&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus gasped, &ldquo;Buffy don&rsquo;t cuss.&rdquo; Buffy gave her camera a\nlook that told her she was holding back a &ldquo;fuck you&rdquo;, but she just turned it\ninto a playful eyeroll.</p><p>&ldquo;Anyways, I&rsquo;m sure the vamps are fine,&rdquo; Buffy reassured\nthem. Cyrus and Andi agreed before Buffy smirked, &ldquo;So Cyrus. What were you\nsmiling at?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Shit,&rdquo; Cyrus whispered.</p><p>-</p><p>TJ once again woke up at 2AM, but not at his own accord.\nAmber was shaking him. He felt something small crawl across his legs above the\nblankets heard Amber whispering. &ldquo;Why do you whisper when you&rsquo;re trying to wake\nme up,&rdquo; TJ groaned, rubbing his eyes. &ldquo;What time is it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Two,&rdquo; Amber said, still whispering. &ldquo;Can I sleep with you?\nMom is on the phone with dad.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s home?&rdquo; TJ sat up. He scooted towards the wall to make\nroom for Amber to sit down.</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s been home,&rdquo; Amber said as she crawled into the bed.\nShe held her knees up to her chest and rested her chin on top of them. &ldquo;I think\nshe got in trouble at work.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh shit,&rdquo; TJ frowned. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not good.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not good at all,&rdquo; Amber started crying. TJ put an\narm around her as her tears got into a flow. TJ tended to ignore everything\nthat went on with their parents, but Amber was the one that paid attention to\nit all. She was their messenger when the fights were horrendous, and she was\nthe one that got lashed on for trying to get them to stop. TJ didn&rsquo;t try\nanything because one, Amber wouldn&rsquo;t let him. Two, he was a coward. He would\njust plug in his earbuds and close his eyes until he was asleep. &ldquo;What are we\ngoing to do?&rdquo; she sobbed.</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be okay,&rdquo; TJ assured her. &ldquo;We have what GG left me if\nanything.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Amber pulled away and shook her head. She started\nwiping her tears. She hated it when TJ saw her cry. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s your money for\ncollege.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t go to college,&rdquo; TJ told her. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m stupid.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, you&rsquo;re not, TJ,&rdquo; Amber lightly tugged his ears. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re\nso so smart. Just because you don&rsquo;t know how to do equations, it doesn&rsquo;t mean\nyou don&rsquo;t know who the thirteenth president of the United States is.&rdquo; TJ bit\nhis lip.</p><p>&ldquo;If she gets fired-,&rdquo; TJ started but Amber nudged him in the\nstomach, making him jump back a little.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think she got fired. She probably just won&rsquo;t get\novertime anymore. But still. Dad needs to land a job. Quick,&rdquo; she told him,\nshifting to hug her knees again.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you think we&rsquo;ll have to move towns?&rdquo; TJ asked her. He\nhad been afraid of that since their dad said he had to look at places out of\nShadyside. He had had three interviews so far.</p><p>&ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; Amber mumbled. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I don&rsquo;t want to.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Me either,&rdquo; TJ told her, looking up at his ceiling. He\ncouldn&rsquo;t see the picture, but he was staring right at the spot where he had his\npolaroid with Cyrus. He couldn&rsquo;t leave now. </p><p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Amber sighed and laid down, &ldquo;night.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Night,&rdquo; TJ mumbled. He didn&rsquo;t lay down though. He stayed\nsitting up, occasionally petting Macaroni who hated it when Amber moved. He\nwould let out little mews and rub his head into TJ&rsquo;s hand until he fell asleep\nagain. Amber was a crazy sleeper and often gave TJ bruises on his legs when she\nstayed in his bed. It wasn&rsquo;t too often, but when it did happen, he felt like\nthey got closer. It was why he couldn&rsquo;t get mad at her or pick on her like he\nused to. They had enough going on. TJ laid down, but he couldn&rsquo;t get his eyes\nclosed. He stared at the spot with the polaroid, songs stuck in his head until\nhe eventually was able to make out Cyrus&rsquo; smile as the sunshine poured in\nthrough the windows.</p><p>He smiled back at it and fell asleep.</p><p>It was twelve in the afternoon when he woke up alone in bed.\nAmber and Macaroni were gone. The sun from the blinds was hitting him directly\nwhich meant that Amber had opened them for him. He liked basking in the sun. It\nfelt warm and safe as if sunshine could never hurt him.</p><p>He rolled over and reached for his phone. He had gotten a\nmessage from Cyrus at 9AM, saying good morning with the sunshine emoji. TJ\nsmiled at it and opened it.</p><p><b>TJ: </b>Good\nmorning underdog. I slept late today</p><p><b>Cyrus: </b>I\nunderstand. You deserve it!</p><p><b>TJ: </b>That&rsquo;s\nsweet of you to say</p><p><b>Cyrus: </b>what\nare the plans for today?</p><p><b>TJ: </b>I have\nwork at 2 today so that&rsquo;s going to be fun. u can drop by if you want</p><p><b>Cyrus: </b>I think\nI&rsquo;m hanging out with Jonah and Andi today around that time but if I manage to\nescape early, ill go by &#128522; don&rsquo;t expect me to do anything tho.

Because it&rsquo;s shady and there will be no\nsun</p><p><b>TJ: </b>oh\nhardy har har </p><p><b>TJ: </b>I\nactually lay in the sun every morning for a while so I think your vampire theory\nis dead</p><p><b>Cyrus: </b>you&rsquo;re\na fool TJ Kippen. Vampires never die.</p><p><b>TJ: </b>I&rsquo;m\ngoing to turn into a bat and fly away next time I see you I swear. </p><p><b>Cyrus: </b>well\nyou can&rsquo;t because I need my polaroid picture back</p><p><b>TJ: </b>you\ngot me there</p><p>TJ rolled out of bed and went to\nshower, playing music on his speaker. He didn&rsquo;t hear anyone else, so he assumed\neveryone else was out. Amber had said something about getting brunch with some\nfriends before work the night before, and he assumed his dad wasn&rsquo;t back yet. His\nmom was a different question and he didn&rsquo;t bother asking himself where she possibly\ncould have had gone. </p><p>He scrolled through his phone through his many playlists and\nsaw C.C.C.M. &nbsp;He smiled before playing\nit. Those songs made his chest fuzzy and sometimes the feelings would get\noverwhelming. But he didn&rsquo;t really mind. He liked the old music that made him\nthink of his new feelings.</p><p><b><i>I know a little bit about a lot of things</i></b></p><p><b><i>But I don&rsquo;t know enough about you</i></b></p><p><b><i>Just when I think you&rsquo;re mine</i></b></p><p><b><i>You try a different line</i></b></p><p><b><i>And baby what can I do</i></b></p><p>-</p><p>When TJ got to work, parents were barely starting to drop\noff their kids. Some of the little kids would give him hugs as they walked in.\nHe loved his job, and he knew that he&rsquo;d never get anything wrong. His manager\nand him split them in groups, and TJ started helping his little group of five\nwith their exercises. A while into work, one of the kids in his group pointed\nto the door and said, &ldquo;Look, TJ. Cyrus is here!&rdquo; All the other little kids in\nthe gym started saying choruses of &lsquo;hi Cyrus&rsquo; and waving furiously at him.\nCyrus had a huge frown when he walked in that quickly faded when the kids all\nstarted going to him. TJ had noticed the frown on time to know something was\nup.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, Underdog,&rdquo; TJ told Cyrus as he approached him. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey, TJ. Just dropping by,&rdquo; Cyrus said, carrying one of the\nyoungest kids in his arms. </p><p>&ldquo;Cathy get down,&rdquo; TJ laughed as the little girl held tightly\nonto Cyrus. She gave TJ puppy eyes, but TJ saw right through them and shook his\nhead. &ldquo;Come on.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Awe snap,&rdquo; Cathy gave TJ an exaggerated frown before Cyrus\nput her back down on the floor. Cathy and the other kids went back to trying to\ndo their stretches when TJ nodded his head towards the matts.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like you mind control them,&rdquo; Cyrus said, a small grin\non his face.</p><p>&ldquo;Vampires can&rsquo;t control minds,&rdquo; TJ smirked then looked\ndirectly at Cyrus. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Wrong?&rdquo; Cyrus seemed to jump. &ldquo;Nothing&rsquo;s wrong. Everything\nis fine.&rdquo; Everything indeed, was not fine.</p><p>&ldquo;I might not know a lot about you, but I can tell when\nsomething is wrong,&rdquo; TJ said and looked at his watch. &ldquo;I have a break in like thirty\nminutes,&rdquo; he said, putting his hand on Cyrus shoulder. Cyrus breath hitched. &ldquo;Do\nyou think you can wait for me to talk about it?&rdquo; TJ then paused. &ldquo;Only if you\nwant to talk about it, though.&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus thought about it for a few seconds before saying, &ldquo;Yeah,\nI&rsquo;ll just sit down for a bit.&rdquo; TJ nodded before letting go of Cyrus&rsquo; shoulder\nand walking back to the kids to continue showing them other exercise. Cyrus\nwent to a chair in the corner, not wanting to touch his phone. He sat with his\narms crossed, his frown eventually turning into a small smile as he watched TJ teach\nthe kids how to do a handstand. Cyrus started laughing when the kids all\nknocked down TJ when he was in the middle of one. It was cute and it hurt Cyrus\nin the chest like a knife. Cyrus looked out the window to the park across the\nstreet and watched more people go by. There were dog walkers, joggers, more\nlittle kids, and the occasional couple. Cyrus grew worried that every couple\ngoing by could be Jonah and Andi. </p><p>The thirty minutes seemed to drag by until TJ eventually\nwent up to Cyrus and smiled at him. &ldquo;I have twenty minutes. Want to go to the\npark?&rdquo; Cyrus eyes at the kids who were all in a circle around who seemed to be\nTJ&rsquo;s boss, drinking a juice box and eating snacks. They were all staring back\nat them, giving him excited waves.</p><p>Cyrus waved back before standing up and saying, &ldquo;Yeah, let&rsquo;s\ngo.&rdquo; Cyrus and TJ went across the street and sat at a bench that was only a minute\nwalk away.</p><p>&ldquo;So do you want to tell me what&rsquo;s wrong or would you rather\nme tell you how Hotel Transylvania ends?&rdquo; TJ smirked, sitting down an inch away\nfrom Cyrus on the bench. </p><p>&ldquo;Hanging out with Andi and Jonah by myself was a mistake,&rdquo;\nCyrus spilled. He didn&rsquo;t like Jonah anymore, and he wasn&rsquo;t jealous. There was\njust something there that made it look like they were both unhappy, but he&rsquo;d\nnever tell Andi. He didn&rsquo;t want her to think that he just wanted Jonah for\nhimself.</p><p>&ldquo;You never look comfortable around Jonah,&rdquo; TJ said, making\nCyrus&rsquo; eyes go wide. Was he that obvious? </p><p>Cyrus stuttered, &ldquo;What do you&hellip; what do you mean?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I mean you&rsquo;re fine around him, but it&rsquo;s never the same\nfeeling around Buffy and Andi. It&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re watching out for something,&rdquo; TJ\nexplained, making Cyrus&rsquo; mouth fall open. He had only watched out that he\nwouldn&rsquo;t catch feelings for him again. Of course, TJ was making that task a lot\neasier. &ldquo;Is there a chunk of the story that I&rsquo;m missing?&rdquo; <i>I only had a heart obliterating crush on him that made me want to fling\nmyself in the ocean, but other than that, not really.</i></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you that part someday,&rdquo; Cyrus told him after a\nfew seconds of stiff silence. &ldquo;I promise.&rdquo; He wasn&rsquo;t ready to come out to TJ\nyet.</p><p>&ldquo;Sounds good,&rdquo; TJ told him. &ldquo;No need to promise. If it\ncomes, it comes.&rdquo; <i>It&rsquo;ll come out of the\ncloset one day</i> Cyrus bit his lip. &ldquo;Why are you upset right now though?\nLike, the actual reason.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Cyrus started, &ldquo;they started fighting while we were\nhanging out. I sort of just sat there not knowing what to do. They almost\ndragged me into, and I just stood up and left without saying anything. I just feel\nso bad leaving them because they&rsquo;re my friends, and I don&rsquo;t them to be\nfighting.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Couples fight, and you shouldn&rsquo;t feel bad about other\npeople&rsquo;s problems,&rdquo; TJ told him, putting his arm around him. Cyrus didn&rsquo;t tense\nup for once. He had grown used to that part of TJ.</p><p>&ldquo;I know but Andi is my best friend and Jonah is her best\nfriend.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Her boyfriend,&rdquo; TJ emphasized. &ldquo;Not yours.&rdquo; A long time\nago, that would&rsquo;ve stung Cyrus. Today, that sentence lifted a weight off his\nshoulders.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; Cyrus told him, already sounding better, &ldquo;I guess\nyou&rsquo;re right.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sometimes I can be right, too,&rdquo; TJ smirked, gently bumping\nthe side of his head on the side of Cyrus&rsquo; for half a second. </p><p>&ldquo;I hope they&rsquo;ll be fine by tonight though,&rdquo; Cyrus told him\napologetically. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re throwing Andi a surprise party, and Buffy, Jonah, and I\nwere supposed to plan it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If Jonah can&rsquo;t pull through, hit me up,&rdquo; TJ told him with a\nsmile.</p><p>&ldquo;Will do either way,&rdquo; Cyrus turned to TJ who was already\nlooking at him. TJ and Cyrus stared at each other for another two seconds, TJ\neyeing the mole and Cyrus testing how fast he could count TJ&rsquo;s freckles before they\nboth bashfully turned away.</p><p><b><i>I read the latest news</i></b></p><p><b><i>No buttons on my shoes</i></b></p><p><b><i>But baby I&rsquo;m confused about you</i></b></p><p><b><i>You get me in a spin</i></b></p><p><b><i>Oh what a stew I&rsquo;m in</i></b></p><p><b><i>&lsquo;Cause I don&rsquo;t know enough about you</i></b></p><p>-</p><p>Monday during third period, TJ was furiously tapping his feet\non the floor. Nobody heard it over all the chatting that was going on as their\nteacher passed back their math test. It was the first chapter test of the year,\nand TJ knew he didn&rsquo;t do well. He was aiming for a C minus when he was studying\nwith Amber, but when he got the test in front of him, nothing made sense. The\nquestions seemed to be in a different language, as if someone had gotten words from\ndifferent magazines and clipped them together. He didn&rsquo;t know what most of the\nquestions were asking, and he had forgotten a few rules for factoring. He\nlooked over across the room at Cyrus who was sitting with Jonah and some other\nkids. Cyrus smiled at TJ, making TJ&rsquo;s tapping ease a little as he returned a\npolite head nod. When the teacher approached TJ, she wore a familiar look on\nher face. TJ knew that face of disappointment all too well, and he already assumed\nthe worst with she placed the test upside down on his desk. He took a deep\nbreath before flipping it upside down.</p><p><b>F</b></p><p><b>See me after school\nplease</b></p><p>Without saying anything, TJ crumbled up the paper and clutched\nit in his hand before storming out of the class. He heard Mrs. Pierson call\nafter him as the rest of the class fell silent, but he kept walking down the hall.\nHe pushed open the restroom door and saw two 6<sup>th</sup> graders in there. &ldquo;Out,&rdquo;\nhe boomed at them, making them jump and run out the door. TJ went to the corner\nof the restroom next to the hand dryer and sat down, test still clutched in his\nhand. He didn&rsquo;t realize how hard he was biting his lip when he tasted the blood\non his tongue. He wanted to kick everything and tear it all apart. He had tried\nso hard for that test, and it was worthless. When the door open, he yelled\nagain, &ldquo;Out!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;TJ,&rdquo; Cyrus peaked his head in, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s me. Mrs. Pierson let\nme come. Can I come in?&rdquo; TJ felt his face get hot. He was embarrassed now. </p><p>&ldquo;Whatever,&rdquo; TJ mumbled. Cyrus took it as a yes and walked\nin, going to TJ&rsquo;s corner. When Cyrus bent down to sit, his head accidently knocked\ninto the air dryer button, making it turn on. TJ bust out laughing as Cyrus jumped\nin fear. &ldquo;Be careful, Cyrus.&rdquo; Cyrus hit the button again with the side of his fist\nto turn it off again, his face showing irritation. He looked down at TJ and his\nface softened up again when he remembered what he was there for. TJ wasn&rsquo;t\nlooking at him but rather, the crumbled up test in his hands. Cyrus sat down\nnext to him, this time being careful with the machine.</p><p>&ldquo;Can I see that?&rdquo; Cyrus pointed at TJ&rsquo;s closed hand.</p><p>&ldquo;The paper or my hand?&rdquo; TJ asked, almost sourly.</p><p>&ldquo;TJ,&rdquo; Cyrus poked him in the stomach, making TJ jump more\ninto the corner. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not here to make fun of you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know but,&rdquo; TJ paused. He didn&rsquo;t have anything else to\nsay. &ldquo;This is just embarrassing. I feel so stupid. I studied, I swear I did. I just&hellip;\ncan&rsquo;t do it.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Yes you can, TJ,&rdquo; Cyrus told him. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not stupid. We\nmight have just started being friends, and I don&rsquo;t know every little thing\nabout you, but I know you&rsquo;re smart. You just need to talk to Mrs. Pierson about\nyour dyscalculia and get a tutor that can work around it. You&rsquo;ll be fine. I\npromise.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You make a lot of promises, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; TJ tilted his to\nlook at Cyrus, a sad and dead look in his eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; Cyrus said matter-of-factly, &ldquo;and I tend to keep all\nof them.&rdquo; TJ gave him half a smile that fell after a second. He put his test in\nCyrus&rsquo; hand before looking away. Cyrus uncrumpled the paper and scanned it. &ldquo;See.\nI&rsquo;m sure she&rsquo;s willing to help. Just go talk to her after school. I can go with\nyou if you want.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why do you care so much Cyrus?&rdquo; TJ asked him, a little too\nbitterly than what he usually spoke like. It was similar to the way he would\ntalking to Buffy when she first got on the team. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m pretty sure you have a\npassing grade. You don&rsquo;t have to worry about my dumbass.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Actually, I tend to just shove my tests in my backpack and\nlook at them a week later when it doesn&rsquo;t hurt,&rdquo; Cyrus said. &ldquo;I like to live a\nlife in denial. So for now, I&rsquo;ll be in denial that you hate that I care about\nyou.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t hate it,&rdquo; TJ looked at him, a huge frown on his\nface. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m actually glad that you care. I just don&rsquo;t like it that you&rsquo;re seeing\nme like this.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I think we&rsquo;ve seen each other however &lsquo;like this&rsquo;,&rdquo; Cyrus\nquote with his hands before handing TJ back his test, &ldquo;plenty of times.&rdquo;</p><p>TJ smiled for once, &ldquo;We have, haven&rsquo;t we.&rdquo; TJ reached for\nhis phone and took off his phone case, confusing Cyrus for a second. TJ then\npulled out the polaroid with their silly faces and handed it to him. &ldquo;Here.\nSince I didn&rsquo;t get to see you this morning.&rdquo; Cyrus looked at the polaroid photo\nand smiled. </p><p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; Cyrus told him softly. TJ was the first to\nstand up and reached out his hand to Cyrus to help him up. Cyrus took it, but\nhe still managed to stumble into him.</p><p>&ldquo;I got you,&rdquo; TJ said, holding Cyrus steady by the arms. </p><p>&ldquo;Me, too,&rdquo; Cyrus smiled at him as he planted his feet firmly\non the ground. Cyrus and TJ stared at each other for a moment and the next\nthing they knew, they were hugging.</p><p><b><i>You know I went to school</i></b></p><p><b><i>And I&rsquo;m nobody&rsquo;s fool</i></b></p><p><b><i>That is to say until I met you!</i></b></p><p><b><i>I know a little bit about a lot o&rsquo; things</i></b></p><p><b><i>But I don&rsquo;t know enough about you</i></b></p><p><b><i>I know a little bit about biology</i></b></p><p><b><i>And a little more about psychology</i></b></p><p><b><i>I&rsquo;m a little gem in geology</i></b></p><p><b><i>But I don&rsquo;t know enough about you</i></b></p><p><a href=\"https://lgbtyrus.tumblr.com/post/177784471299/tjs-playlist-chapter-4\">Next Chapter</a></p>",
