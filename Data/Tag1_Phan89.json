His hands are shaking and there&rsquo;s a lump in his throat and he can feel sweat beginning to prickle around his temples and at the back of his neck, because his entire body is flushed too warm for no reason other than he&rsquo;s nervous. </p><p>Nervous for a very stupid reason, at that. Phil&rsquo;s always been one to get nervous for regular hook-ups, but this&hellip; isn&rsquo;t a regular hook-up. There&rsquo;s no uncertainty for him to waffle over, no need to plan any moves in advance, no worry that there won&rsquo;t be any chemistry or that he&rsquo;ll underperform. He&rsquo;s done this before. He knows how it works. He knows what to do and how to do it well. Under these circumstances, he should be feeling pretty confident. And if this were a cut-and-dry hook-up, maybe he would. </p><p>It&rsquo;s not cut-and-dry though. Nothing with Dan ever is. </p><p>It&rsquo;s stressful. Phil&rsquo;s not usually one to overthink things, except for when it comes to Dan. Then he overthinks everything. Which sucks, because Dan is pretty much the only thing that he can&rsquo;t afford to overthink. \u00a0</p><p>He rubs his hand down over his face in frustration as he stands, pondering his reflection in the mirror. His hair&rsquo;s getting a bit bird-nesty, he could probably stand to cut it. His eyes look a bit bleary from having his contacts in too long. Biting his lip is a nervous habit of his, but he doesn&rsquo;t even realize he&rsquo;s been doing it until he sees how red and raw his bottom lip looks. He likes to tell himself that looks don&rsquo;t matter, but he feels oddly self-conscious right now.</p><p>He&rsquo;s considering changing into something a bit more flattering than his jeans and university hoodie when he feels his phone vibrate in his pocket. </p><p><i><b>dan [1:41am]:</b> \u00a0hurry up i want you</i></p><p>There&rsquo;s a mostly pleasant swooping sensation in the pit of his stomach, and that&rsquo;s enough for him to start thinking with his dick again. For now. </p><p>He turns out the light and treads quietly out of his bedroom. </p><p>*</p><p>The third step up from the bottom of the stairs creaks, he reminds himself as he gingerly takes his first few steps down. </p><p>Not that it matters, probably. From up here he can tell that the drinking games are still going strong over in the lounge, and it&rsquo;s not like anyone&rsquo;s gonna be listening for him. </p><p>He skips over the step anyway. </p><p>Going out the front would entail passing through the lounge and all of his housemates, so he opts for the back door. He makes it as far as the darkened kitchen before the light switches on and there&rsquo;s a soft throat-clearing noise behind him. </p><p>&ldquo;Right then, Lester, where&rsquo;re you off to?&rdquo;</p><p>He doesn&rsquo;t have to stop. He could pretend he doesn&rsquo;t hear her, keep walking on out the door, and be chastised in the morning. </p><p>But he doesn&rsquo;t have the balls to do that, and they both know it. So he pauses and sighs and turns around. </p><p>Addy looks quite nice tonight. Her slim-fit navy dress really brings out the blue in her eyes, and her jet-black hair falls smoothly over her shoulders. They get mistaken for siblings sometimes, though Phil&rsquo;s quite sure that their resemblance doesn&rsquo;t extend anywhere beyond hair and eye color. And his hair isn&rsquo;t even natural.</p><p>It&rsquo;s the first that he&rsquo;s seen of her tonight. She must have just got back from her date, then. </p><p>She looks nice, but she also looks confused in spite of her mildly accusatory tone of voice. </p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a pretty necklace.&rdquo; He says lamely, glancing down at the little silver pendant resting just below her collarbone as a convenient means of avoiding eye contact. &ldquo;Did Sam give it to you? Happy anniversary by the way, how was dinner?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;It was good. He&rsquo;s already starting to get pissed out there with the rest of them. Also, you&rsquo;re shit at deflecting. Tell me where you&rsquo;re going.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Does it matter? I&rsquo;m an adult.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s meant to be a joke, kind of, but it really just comes out sounding incredibly stupid, even for him. He shouldn&rsquo;t try to go on the defensive, like, ever. Especially with Addy. Even considering that she&rsquo;s his best friend, he still finds her ability to consistently see right through him a little unnerving.</p><p>&ldquo;Maybe. Technically.&rdquo; She shrugs, and crosses her arms. She doesn&rsquo;t look mad or intimidating. Just&hellip; determined. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just a bit surprised to see you headed out when everyone just told me that you&rsquo;d gone up to bed for the night.&rdquo;</p><p>He&rsquo;s about to respond with some on-the-spot, half-assed lie before he&rsquo;s interrupted by another vibration in his pocket. </p><p>He&rsquo;s not the only one who notices. Her eyes flicker briefly to his pocket, and then back up at him again. </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to see him.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s a statement, not a question. Her voice has gone a bit softer, and he hates that. Not because he hates softness in general, but he knows that she hasn&rsquo;t changed her tone to be gentle. She&rsquo;s changed it because she feels bad for him. </p><p>He sighs and deflates a little. &ldquo;How do you know it&rsquo;s him? It could be someone else.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I guess.&rdquo; She steps closer. Her heels make it so that she&rsquo;s much closer to eye level with him than usual. &ldquo;I just don&rsquo;t know why you&rsquo;d be sneaking out the back for anyone but him.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re good at fucking each other.&rdquo; He shrugs and shoves his hands into the pocket of his hoodie. Maybe the abrupt change of subject will throw her off. Just a little. Just for a minute. He needs to level the playing field somehow. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just sex. It&rsquo;s fun. No one&rsquo;s getting hurt.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe that.&rdquo; Her reply is instantaneous. &ldquo;And I don&rsquo;t think you do, either.&rdquo;</p><p>He&rsquo;s quiet for a moment and he wills his voice not to sound as pathetic as he feels when he speaks up again. </p><p>&ldquo;Dan&rsquo;s not a bad person.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know he&rsquo;s not, babe.&rdquo; Another quick reply. He knows that she means it. She and Dan had gotten on quite well before the&hellip; unpleasantness. </p><p>They&rsquo;ve had this talk a million times over the past month. <i>It&rsquo;s not healthy, it&rsquo;s not healthy, it&rsquo;s not healthy. I know you still love him but it&rsquo;s not healthy. You&rsquo;ll never get over him if you keep having these backslides.</i></p><p><i>Maybe I don&rsquo;t want to get over him.</i> He never actually says that bit out loud. Then he&rsquo;d never hear the end of it. </p><p>&ldquo;He broke your heart though, yeah?&rdquo;</p><p><i>He didn&rsquo;t want to. But&hellip; </i></p><p>&ldquo;&hellip;Yeah.&rdquo;</p><p>He doesn&rsquo;t say anything else. She doesn&rsquo;t either, for a while. He reckons she&rsquo;s resigned, which he can&rsquo;t help but feel bad about. Her heart&rsquo;s in the right place. He&rsquo;s just weak. </p><p>His hand twitches instinctively towards his pocket when he feels another vibration. Then, her hand comes to rest on his cheek. </p><p>&ldquo;Just be safe, alright?&rdquo;</p><p>He&rsquo;s ready to make some cheeky comment about Dan&rsquo;s impressive stash of free condoms from the student center in an attempt to break the tension or lighten the mood or <i>something</i>, but she cuts in before he can get a word out, like she&rsquo;s already read his mind.</p><p>&ldquo;Not like that. I mean watch out for yourself. Think about what you&rsquo;re doing and make sure that you really believe that it&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s best for you. And for him.&rdquo; \u00a0</p><p>He stands still there for a minute after she walks out. He owes it to her to at least let her words sink in before reaching into his pocket to see what those two little vibrations were about.</p><p><i><b>dan [1:43am]:</b> \u00a0i might just start without you if you don&rsquo;t get your ass over here soon :p</i></p><p><i><b>dan [1:45am]: </b>phiiiiiiiiiilllllllllll :(</i></p><p>He does have a choice here, he knows that. But the undeniable ache in his chest makes him feel like he really, really doesn&rsquo;t.</p><p>*</p><p>The soft, pitchy breath that Dan stifles into his shoulder when he finally bottoms out, after an agonizing minute of working himself slowly down on Phil&rsquo;s cock, is objectively the best sound in the world. He soaks it up and holds onto it every single time, on the dreaded chance that he might never get to hear it again. The possibility is always there. It could happen any day. </p><p>&ldquo;Fuck.&rdquo; Dan&rsquo;s nails dig deep into his shoulder blades. &ldquo;Give me a sec. I swear your dick got bigger since last time.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Last time was less than a week ago.&rdquo; Phil reminds him, deliberately letting his breath ghost over Dan&rsquo;s neck as he winds his arms securely around his waist. It has the desired effect; Dan shudders and relaxes a bit. &ldquo;And it definitely didn&rsquo;t. You&rsquo;re just not prepped enough, you got impatient.&rdquo;</p><p>He receives only a delayed <i>hmph</i> in response, and he has to smirk. Because Dan doesn&rsquo;t want to admit that he&rsquo;s right, but it&rsquo;s kind of impossible for either of them to deny.</p><p>&ldquo;Right, c'mere.&rdquo; His voice goes softer than intended and he slides one hand up to tangle into Dan&rsquo;s hair. Dan obliges and tilts his head before Phil can even tell him to. &ldquo;Relax.&rdquo; He murmurs in between hot, wet kisses to Dan&rsquo;s neck, particularly all the sensitive spots that he&rsquo;s had memorized for what feels like ages. &ldquo;You feel so fucking good.&rdquo; </p><p>He does. Dan&rsquo;s warmth clenching around him so tight that he can&rsquo;t move is actually bordering on too much. Bordering, because he doesn&rsquo;t think that 'too much&rsquo; is really a part of his vocabulary when it comes to Dan. With Dan, he always wants more. </p><p>So he chases it. </p><p>Instant gratification, that&rsquo;s what this is. That&rsquo;s why they do this. That&rsquo;s what he tells himself when Dan starts rocking against him, that&rsquo;s what he tells himself when he grabs onto Dan&rsquo;s hips hard enough to bruise and guides him down harder and faster, that&rsquo;s what he tells himself when Dan&rsquo;s panting and moaning and begging for more, that&rsquo;s what he tells himself when he flips them over and pounds into him with total abandon because he knows they&rsquo;re right on the limit. That&rsquo;s what he tells himself when Dan&rsquo;s legs start to shake and his eyes flutter shut and he clenches around him, and that&rsquo;s what he tells himself when his hips stutter and he buries himself deep inside one last time and collapses almost before the relief of his orgasm finishes washing over him. </p><p>Then he rolls off, so they&rsquo;re laid side by side with their bodies limp and boneless and their chests flushed and hearts pounding. Phil lets his eyes fall shut, then, because this is the part where they stop bullshitting themselves. </p><p>&ldquo;I love you.&rdquo; Dan whispers, and hands him a couple tissues. </p><p>He sighs, opens his eyes and hastily cleans off the mess of Dan&rsquo;s cum that&rsquo;s painted onto his chest and stomach. </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah. I love you too.&rdquo;</p><p>*</p><p>The only light in the room now comes from the cheap fairy lights that Dan&rsquo;s strung up on the wall behind his bed. They cast a dim glow onto the bottle of Malibu that Dan&rsquo;s rolling in between his hands - the one he keeps by the side of his bed that makes him look like an alcoholic, though it&rsquo;s really just there to stay safe from his housemates given their tendency to steal any liquor they can get their hands on. </p><p>&ldquo;You sure you don&rsquo;t want any?&rdquo; Dan offers, and Phil just shakes his head and slides down under the covers. &ldquo;Had enough earlier. Everyone kept fucking me over in Kings.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Explains why it took you so fucking long to get here.&rdquo; Dan takes a decent pull from the bottle and then sets it down before joining him under the covers. He holds an arm out and Phil curls into him, head resting on Dan&rsquo;s shoulder. </p><p>&ldquo;No, I tried to get here quick. Addy stopped me on the way out, though.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh.&rdquo; Dan&rsquo;s body stills, and for a few moments the room lapses into a tense silence. &ldquo;She told you not to come, I guess.&rdquo;</p><p>He doesn&rsquo;t deny it, because there&rsquo;s really no use. &ldquo;I came anyway, though, didn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She must fucking hate me now.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t.&rdquo; </p><p>It&rsquo;s too dark to really read Dan&rsquo;s expression, but Phil can sense that he&rsquo;s being cast a very skeptical look. </p><p>&ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t.&rdquo; He repeats. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s just worried. About both of us. 'Cause, you know&hellip;&rdquo; He trails off. He doesn&rsquo;t need to say it; Dan knows. </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s better this way.&rdquo; Dan mumbles. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a shit boyfriend, Phil. I&rsquo;m just like, a shit person altogether. I have no idea what I&rsquo;m doing with my life, I&rsquo;ve just as good as flunked out of law school. Some day I&rsquo;m gonna start to drag you down too much, this way you&rsquo;re off the hook. You can just&hellip; leave. No strings.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil doesn&rsquo;t respond. This is another conversation he&rsquo;s had a million times. Another conversation that just goes around in circles. It doesn&rsquo;t seem to matter how many times he tells Dan that it&rsquo;s too late for no strings. That&rsquo;s not something that works retroactively. Not for him. </p><p>It seems to make sense to Dan that they still fuck basically every week, that they still say<i> I love you,</i> but they somehow can&rsquo;t be together. Phil&rsquo;s not sure if they broke up because Dan just doesn&rsquo;t care, or if Dan thinks that <i>Phil</i> doesn&rsquo;t care. Surely it can&rsquo;t be that. How many times has he told Dan that he loves him in spite of everything, that he wants him complete with all of his flaws? The same way that Dan wants him&hellip; or wanted him, at one point. He doesn&rsquo;t know anymore. </p><p>Because he knows Dan isn&rsquo;t the type to suddenly stop caring about something, or someone. Dan cares a whole fucking lot. But something gets in the way sometimes. Something unreadable, that makes the light go out in his eyes. Phil knows he can&rsquo;t replace that light, he&rsquo;s tried. But god damn, he at least wants to help find something that can. </p><p>&ldquo;Does this feel like no strings to you?&rdquo; Phil asks quietly. Maybe Dan will listen to himself, if he can&rsquo;t listen to Phil.</p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; </p><p>Phil waits a moment for him to elaborate, but he doesn&rsquo;t. &ldquo;Me neither. What if it stays that way?&rdquo;</p><p>Dan doesn&rsquo;t respond, but he does rest his cheek down on top of Phil&rsquo;s head when he scoots in closer. </p><p>They&rsquo;re both hanging onto something, surely. The question is whether they&rsquo;re hanging onto the same thing. </p><p>He&rsquo;s not so sure he wants to know.</p><p>*</p><p><i>for <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfTZwY5VPpShXmJM3HNLP7A\" target=\"_blank\">@phandomficfests</a> shuffle mode; song prompt: waiting game by banks</i><br/></p>",

His hands are shaking and there\u2019s a lump in his throat and he can feel sweat beginning to prickle around his temples and at the back of his neck, because his entire body is flushed too warm for no reason other than he\u2019s nervous. </p><p>Nervous for a very stupid reason, at that. Phil\u2019s always been one to get nervous for regular hook-ups, but this\u2026 isn\u2019t a regular hook-up. There\u2019s no uncertainty for him to waffle over, no need to plan any moves in advance, no worry that there won\u2019t be any chemistry or that he\u2019ll underperform. He\u2019s done this before. He knows how it works. He knows what to do and how to do it well. Under these circumstances, he should be feeling pretty confident. And if this were a cut-and-dry hook-up, maybe he would. </p><p>It\u2019s not cut-and-dry though. Nothing with Dan ever is. </p><p>It\u2019s stressful. Phil\u2019s not usually one to overthink things, except for when it comes to Dan. Then he overthinks everything. Which sucks, because Dan is pretty much the only thing that he can\u2019t afford to overthink. \u00a0</p><p>He rubs his hand down over his face in frustration as he stands, pondering his reflection in the mirror. His hair\u2019s getting a bit bird-nesty, he could probably stand to cut it. His eyes look a bit bleary from having his contacts in too long. Biting his lip is a nervous habit of his, but he doesn\u2019t even realize he\u2019s been doing it until he sees how red and raw his bottom lip looks. He likes to tell himself that looks don\u2019t matter, but he feels oddly self-conscious right now.</p><p>He\u2019s considering changing into something a bit more flattering than his jeans and university hoodie when he feels his phone vibrate in his pocket. </p><p><i><b>dan [1:41am]:</b> \u00a0hurry up i want you</i></p><p>There\u2019s a mostly pleasant swooping sensation in the pit of his stomach, and that\u2019s enough for him to start thinking with his dick again. For now. </p><p>He turns out the light and treads quietly out of his bedroom. </p><p>*</p><p>The third step up from the bottom of the stairs creaks, he reminds himself as he gingerly takes his first few steps down. </p><p>Not that it matters, probably. From up here he can tell that the drinking games are still going strong over in the lounge, and it\u2019s not like anyone\u2019s gonna be listening for him. </p><p>He skips over the step anyway. </p><p>Going out the front would entail passing through the lounge and all of his housemates, so he opts for the back door. He makes it as far as the darkened kitchen before the light switches on and there\u2019s a soft throat-clearing noise behind him. </p><p>\u201cRight then, Lester, where\u2019re you off to?\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t have to stop. He could pretend he doesn\u2019t hear her, keep walking on out the door, and be chastised in the morning. </p><p>But he doesn\u2019t have the balls to do that, and they both know it. So he pauses and sighs and turns around. </p><p>Addy looks quite nice tonight. Her slim-fit navy dress really brings out the blue in her eyes, and her jet-black hair falls smoothly over her shoulders. They get mistaken for siblings sometimes, though Phil\u2019s quite sure that their resemblance doesn\u2019t extend anywhere beyond hair and eye color. And his hair isn\u2019t even natural.</p><p>It\u2019s the first that he\u2019s seen of her tonight. She must have just got back from her date, then. </p><p>She looks nice, but she also looks confused in spite of her mildly accusatory tone of voice. </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a pretty necklace.\u201d He says lamely, glancing down at the little silver pendant resting just below her collarbone as a convenient means of avoiding eye contact. \u201cDid Sam give it to you? Happy anniversary by the way, how was dinner?\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt was good. He\u2019s already starting to get pissed out there with the rest of them. Also, you\u2019re shit at deflecting. Tell me where you\u2019re going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes it matter? I\u2019m an adult.\u201d It\u2019s meant to be a joke, kind of, but it really just comes out sounding incredibly stupid, even for him. He shouldn\u2019t try to go on the defensive, like, ever. Especially with Addy. Even considering that she\u2019s his best friend, he still finds her ability to consistently see right through him a little unnerving.</p><p>\u201cMaybe. Technically.\u201d She shrugs, and crosses her arms. She doesn\u2019t look mad or intimidating. Just\u2026 determined. \u201cI\u2019m just a bit surprised to see you headed out when everyone just told me that you\u2019d gone up to bed for the night.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s about to respond with some on-the-spot, half-assed lie before he\u2019s interrupted by another vibration in his pocket. </p><p>He\u2019s not the only one who notices. Her eyes flicker briefly to his pocket, and then back up at him again. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to see him.\u201d It\u2019s a statement, not a question. Her voice has gone a bit softer, and he hates that. Not because he hates softness in general, but he knows that she hasn\u2019t changed her tone to be gentle. She\u2019s changed it because she feels bad for him. </p><p>He sighs and deflates a little. \u201cHow do you know it\u2019s him? It could be someone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess.\u201d She steps closer. Her heels make it so that she\u2019s much closer to eye level with him than usual. \u201cI just don\u2019t know why you\u2019d be sneaking out the back for anyone but him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re good at fucking each other.\u201d He shrugs and shoves his hands into the pocket of his hoodie. Maybe the abrupt change of subject will throw her off. Just a little. Just for a minute. He needs to level the playing field somehow. \u201cIt\u2019s just sex. It\u2019s fun. No one\u2019s getting hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe that.\u201d Her reply is instantaneous. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think you do, either.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s quiet for a moment and he wills his voice not to sound as pathetic as he feels when he speaks up again. </p><p>\u201cDan\u2019s not a bad person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know he\u2019s not, babe.\u201d Another quick reply. He knows that she means it. She and Dan had gotten on quite well before the\u2026 unpleasantness. </p><p>They\u2019ve had this talk a million times over the past month. <i>It\u2019s not healthy, it\u2019s not healthy, it\u2019s not healthy. I know you still love him but it\u2019s not healthy. You\u2019ll never get over him if you keep having these backslides.</i></p><p><i>Maybe I don\u2019t want to get over him.</i> He never actually says that bit out loud. Then he\u2019d never hear the end of it. </p><p>\u201cHe broke your heart though, yeah?\u201d</p><p><i>He didn\u2019t want to. But\u2026 </i></p><p>\u201c\u2026Yeah.\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t say anything else. She doesn\u2019t either, for a while. He reckons she\u2019s resigned, which he can\u2019t help but feel bad about. Her heart\u2019s in the right place. He\u2019s just weak. </p><p>His hand twitches instinctively towards his pocket when he feels another vibration. Then, her hand comes to rest on his cheek. </p><p>\u201cJust be safe, alright?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s ready to make some cheeky comment about Dan\u2019s impressive stash of free condoms from the student center in an attempt to break the tension or lighten the mood or <i>something</i>, but she cuts in before he can get a word out, like she\u2019s already read his mind.</p><p>\u201cNot like that. I mean watch out for yourself. Think about what you\u2019re doing and make sure that you really believe that it\u2019s what\u2019s best for you. And for him.\u201d \u00a0</p><p>He stands still there for a minute after she walks out. He owes it to her to at least let her words sink in before reaching into his pocket to see what those two little vibrations were about.</p><p><i><b>dan [1:43am]:</b> \u00a0i might just start without you if you don\u2019t get your ass over here soon :p</i></p><p><i><b>dan [1:45am]: </b>phiiiiiiiiiilllllllllll :(</i></p><p>He does have a choice here, he knows that. But the undeniable ache in his chest makes him feel like he really, really doesn\u2019t.</p><p>*</p><p>The soft, pitchy breath that Dan stifles into his shoulder when he finally bottoms out, after an agonizing minute of working himself slowly down on Phil\u2019s cock, is objectively the best sound in the world. He soaks it up and holds onto it every single time, on the dreaded chance that he might never get to hear it again. The possibility is always there. It could happen any day. </p><p>\u201cFuck.\u201d Dan\u2019s nails dig deep into his shoulder blades. \u201cGive me a sec. I swear your dick got bigger since last time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLast time was less than a week ago.\u201d Phil reminds him, deliberately letting his breath ghost over Dan\u2019s neck as he winds his arms securely around his waist. It has the desired effect; Dan shudders and relaxes a bit. \u201cAnd it definitely didn\u2019t. You\u2019re just not prepped enough, you got impatient.\u201d</p><p>He receives only a delayed <i>hmph</i> in response, and he has to smirk. Because Dan doesn\u2019t want to admit that he\u2019s right, but it\u2019s kind of impossible for either of them to deny.</p><p>\u201cRight, c'mere.\u201d His voice goes softer than intended and he slides one hand up to tangle into Dan\u2019s hair. Dan obliges and tilts his head before Phil can even tell him to. \u201cRelax.\u201d He murmurs in between hot, wet kisses to Dan\u2019s neck, particularly all the sensitive spots that he\u2019s had memorized for what feels like ages. \u201cYou feel so fucking good.\u201d </p><p>He does. Dan\u2019s warmth clenching around him so tight that he can\u2019t move is actually bordering on too much. Bordering, because he doesn\u2019t think that 'too much\u2019 is really a part of his vocabulary when it comes to Dan. With Dan, he always wants more. </p><p>So he chases it. </p><p>Instant gratification, that\u2019s what this is. That\u2019s why they do this. That\u2019s what he tells himself when Dan starts rocking against him, that\u2019s what he tells himself when he grabs onto Dan\u2019s hips hard enough to bruise and guides him down harder and faster, that\u2019s what he tells himself when Dan\u2019s panting and moaning and begging for more, that\u2019s what he tells himself when he flips them over and pounds into him with total abandon because he knows they\u2019re right on the limit. That\u2019s what he tells himself when Dan\u2019s legs start to shake and his eyes flutter shut and he clenches around him, and that\u2019s what he tells himself when his hips stutter and he buries himself deep inside one last time and collapses almost before the relief of his orgasm finishes washing over him. </p><p>Then he rolls off, so they\u2019re laid side by side with their bodies limp and boneless and their chests flushed and hearts pounding. Phil lets his eyes fall shut, then, because this is the part where they stop bullshitting themselves. </p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d Dan whispers, and hands him a couple tissues. </p><p>He sighs, opens his eyes and hastily cleans off the mess of Dan\u2019s cum that\u2019s painted onto his chest and stomach. </p><p>\u201cYeah. I love you too.\u201d</p><p>*</p><p>The only light in the room now comes from the cheap fairy lights that Dan\u2019s strung up on the wall behind his bed. They cast a dim glow onto the bottle of Malibu that Dan\u2019s rolling in between his hands - the one he keeps by the side of his bed that makes him look like an alcoholic, though it\u2019s really just there to stay safe from his housemates given their tendency to steal any liquor they can get their hands on. </p><p>\u201cYou sure you don\u2019t want any?\u201d Dan offers, and Phil just shakes his head and slides down under the covers. \u201cHad enough earlier.

His hands are shaking and there\u2019s a lump in his throat and he can feel sweat beginning to prickle around his temples and at the back of his neck, because his entire body is flushed too warm for no reason other than he\u2019s nervous. </p><p>Nervous for a very stupid reason, at that. Phil\u2019s always been one to get nervous for regular hook-ups, but this\u2026 isn\u2019t a regular hook-up. There\u2019s no uncertainty for him to waffle over, no need to plan any moves in advance, no worry that there won\u2019t be any chemistry or that he\u2019ll underperform. He\u2019s done this before. He knows how it works. He knows what to do and how to do it well. Under these circumstances, he should be feeling pretty confident. And if this were a cut-and-dry hook-up, maybe he would. </p><p>It\u2019s not cut-and-dry though. Nothing with Dan ever is. </p><p>It\u2019s stressful. Phil\u2019s not usually one to overthink things, except for when it comes to Dan. Then he overthinks everything. Which sucks, because Dan is pretty much the only thing that he can\u2019t afford to overthink. \u00a0</p><p>He rubs his hand down over his face in frustration as he stands, pondering his reflection in the mirror. His hair\u2019s getting a bit bird-nesty, he could probably stand to cut it. His eyes look a bit bleary from having his contacts in too long. Biting his lip is a nervous habit of his, but he doesn\u2019t even realize he\u2019s been doing it until he sees how red and raw his bottom lip looks. He likes to tell himself that looks don\u2019t matter, but he feels oddly self-conscious right now.</p><p>He\u2019s considering changing into something a bit more flattering than his jeans and university hoodie when he feels his phone vibrate in his pocket. </p><p><i><b>dan [1:41am]:</b> \u00a0hurry up i want you</i></p><p>There\u2019s a mostly pleasant swooping sensation in the pit of his stomach, and that\u2019s enough for him to start thinking with his dick again. For now. </p><p>He turns out the light and treads quietly out of his bedroom. </p><p>*</p><p>The third step up from the bottom of the stairs creaks, he reminds himself as he gingerly takes his first few steps down. </p><p>Not that it matters, probably. From up here he can tell that the drinking games are still going strong over in the lounge, and it\u2019s not like anyone\u2019s gonna be listening for him. </p><p>He skips over the step anyway. </p><p>Going out the front would entail passing through the lounge and all of his housemates, so he opts for the back door. He makes it as far as the darkened kitchen before the light switches on and there\u2019s a soft throat-clearing noise behind him. </p><p>\u201cRight then, Lester, where\u2019re you off to?\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t have to stop. He could pretend he doesn\u2019t hear her, keep walking on out the door, and be chastised in the morning. </p><p>But he doesn\u2019t have the balls to do that, and they both know it. So he pauses and sighs and turns around. </p><p>Addy looks quite nice tonight. Her slim-fit navy dress really brings out the blue in her eyes, and her jet-black hair falls smoothly over her shoulders. They get mistaken for siblings sometimes, though Phil\u2019s quite sure that their resemblance doesn\u2019t extend anywhere beyond hair and eye color. And his hair isn\u2019t even natural.</p><p>It\u2019s the first that he\u2019s seen of her tonight. She must have just got back from her date, then. </p><p>She looks nice, but she also looks confused in spite of her mildly accusatory tone of voice. </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a pretty necklace.\u201d He says lamely, glancing down at the little silver pendant resting just below her collarbone as a convenient means of avoiding eye contact. \u201cDid Sam give it to you? Happy anniversary by the way, how was dinner?\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt was good. He\u2019s already starting to get pissed out there with the rest of them. Also, you\u2019re shit at deflecting. Tell me where you\u2019re going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes it matter? I\u2019m an adult.\u201d It\u2019s meant to be a joke, kind of, but it really just comes out sounding incredibly stupid, even for him. He shouldn\u2019t try to go on the defensive, like, ever. Especially with Addy. Even considering that she\u2019s his best friend, he still finds her ability to consistently see right through him a little unnerving.</p><p>\u201cMaybe. Technically.\u201d She shrugs, and crosses her arms. She doesn\u2019t look mad or intimidating. Just\u2026 determined. \u201cI\u2019m just a bit surprised to see you headed out when everyone just told me that you\u2019d gone up to bed for the night.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s about to respond with some on-the-spot, half-assed lie before he\u2019s interrupted by another vibration in his pocket. </p><p>He\u2019s not the only one who notices. Her eyes flicker briefly to his pocket, and then back up at him again. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to see him.\u201d It\u2019s a statement, not a question. Her voice has gone a bit softer, and he hates that. Not because he hates softness in general, but he knows that she hasn\u2019t changed her tone to be gentle. She\u2019s changed it because she feels bad for him. </p><p>He sighs and deflates a little. \u201cHow do you know it\u2019s him? It could be someone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess.\u201d She steps closer. Her heels make it so that she\u2019s much closer to eye level with him than usual. \u201cI just don\u2019t know why you\u2019d be sneaking out the back for anyone but him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re good at fucking each other.\u201d He shrugs and shoves his hands into the pocket of his hoodie. Maybe the abrupt change of subject will throw her off. Just a little. Just for a minute. He needs to level the playing field somehow. \u201cIt\u2019s just sex. It\u2019s fun. No one\u2019s getting hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe that.\u201d Her reply is instantaneous. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think you do, either.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s quiet for a moment and he wills his voice not to sound as pathetic as he feels when he speaks up again. </p><p>\u201cDan\u2019s not a bad person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know he\u2019s not, babe.\u201d Another quick reply. He knows that she means it. She and Dan had gotten on quite well before the\u2026 unpleasantness. </p><p>They\u2019ve had this talk a million times over the past month. <i>It\u2019s not healthy, it\u2019s not healthy, it\u2019s not healthy. I know you still love him but it\u2019s not healthy. You\u2019ll never get over him if you keep having these backslides.</i></p><p><i>Maybe I don\u2019t want to get over him.</i> He never actually says that bit out loud. Then he\u2019d never hear the end of it. </p><p>\u201cHe broke your heart though, yeah?\u201d</p><p><i>He didn\u2019t want to. But\u2026 </i></p><p>\u201c\u2026Yeah.\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t say anything else. She doesn\u2019t either, for a while. He reckons she\u2019s resigned, which he can\u2019t help but feel bad about. Her heart\u2019s in the right place. He\u2019s just weak. </p><p>His hand twitches instinctively towards his pocket when he feels another vibration. Then, her hand comes to rest on his cheek. </p><p>\u201cJust be safe, alright?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s ready to make some cheeky comment about Dan\u2019s impressive stash of free condoms from the student center in an attempt to break the tension or lighten the mood or <i>something</i>, but she cuts in before he can get a word out, like she\u2019s already read his mind.</p><p>\u201cNot like that. I mean watch out for yourself. Think about what you\u2019re doing and make sure that you really believe that it\u2019s what\u2019s best for you. And for him.\u201d \u00a0</p><p>He stands still there for a minute after she walks out. He owes it to her to at least let her words sink in before reaching into his pocket to see what those two little vibrations were about.</p><p><i><b>dan [1:43am]:</b> \u00a0i might just start without you if you don\u2019t get your ass over here soon :p</i></p><p><i><b>dan [1:45am]: </b>phiiiiiiiiiilllllllllll :(</i></p><p>He does have a choice here, he knows that. But the undeniable ache in his chest makes him feel like he really, really doesn\u2019t.</p><p>*</p><p>The soft, pitchy breath that Dan stifles into his shoulder when he finally bottoms out, after an agonizing minute of working himself slowly down on Phil\u2019s cock, is objectively the best sound in the world. He soaks it up and holds onto it every single time, on the dreaded chance that he might never get to hear it again. The possibility is always there. It could happen any day. </p><p>\u201cFuck.\u201d Dan\u2019s nails dig deep into his shoulder blades. \u201cGive me a sec. I swear your dick got bigger since last time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLast time was less than a week ago.\u201d Phil reminds him, deliberately letting his breath ghost over Dan\u2019s neck as he winds his arms securely around his waist. It has the desired effect; Dan shudders and relaxes a bit. \u201cAnd it definitely didn\u2019t. You\u2019re just not prepped enough, you got impatient.\u201d</p><p>He receives only a delayed <i>hmph</i> in response, and he has to smirk. Because Dan doesn\u2019t want to admit that he\u2019s right, but it\u2019s kind of impossible for either of them to deny.</p><p>\u201cRight, c'mere.\u201d His voice goes softer than intended and he slides one hand up to tangle into Dan\u2019s hair. Dan obliges and tilts his head before Phil can even tell him to. \u201cRelax.\u201d He murmurs in between hot, wet kisses to Dan\u2019s neck, particularly all the sensitive spots that he\u2019s had memorized for what feels like ages. \u201cYou feel so fucking good.\u201d </p><p>He does. Dan\u2019s warmth clenching around him so tight that he can\u2019t move is actually bordering on too much. Bordering, because he doesn\u2019t think that 'too much\u2019 is really a part of his vocabulary when it comes to Dan. With Dan, he always wants more. </p><p>So he chases it. </p><p>Instant gratification, that\u2019s what this is. That\u2019s why they do this. That\u2019s what he tells himself when Dan starts rocking against him, that\u2019s what he tells himself when he grabs onto Dan\u2019s hips hard enough to bruise and guides him down harder and faster, that\u2019s what he tells himself when Dan\u2019s panting and moaning and begging for more, that\u2019s what he tells himself when he flips them over and pounds into him with total abandon because he knows they\u2019re right on the limit. That\u2019s what he tells himself when Dan\u2019s legs start to shake and his eyes flutter shut and he clenches around him, and that\u2019s what he tells himself when his hips stutter and he buries himself deep inside one last time and collapses almost before the relief of his orgasm finishes washing over him. </p><p>Then he rolls off, so they\u2019re laid side by side with their bodies limp and boneless and their chests flushed and hearts pounding. Phil lets his eyes fall shut, then, because this is the part where they stop bullshitting themselves. </p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d Dan whispers, and hands him a couple tissues. </p><p>He sighs, opens his eyes and hastily cleans off the mess of Dan\u2019s cum that\u2019s painted onto his chest and stomach. </p><p>\u201cYeah. I love you too.\u201d</p><p>*</p><p>The only light in the room now comes from the cheap fairy lights that Dan\u2019s strung up on the wall behind his bed. They cast a dim glow onto the bottle of Malibu that Dan\u2019s rolling in between his hands - the one he keeps by the side of his bed that makes him look like an alcoholic, though it\u2019s really just there to stay safe from his housemates given their tendency to steal any liquor they can get their hands on. </p><p>\u201cYou sure you don\u2019t want any?\u201d Dan offers, and Phil just shakes his head and slides down under the covers. \u201cHad enough earlier. Everyone kept fucking me over in Kings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExplains why it took you so fucking long to get here.\u201d Dan takes a decent pull from the bottle and then sets it down before joining him under the covers. He holds an arm out and Phil curls into him, head resting on Dan\u2019s shoulder. </p><p>\u201cNo, I tried to get here quick. Addy stopped me on the way out, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Dan\u2019s body stills, and for a few moments the room lapses into a tense silence. \u201cShe told you not to come, I guess.\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t deny it, because there\u2019s really no use. \u201cI came anyway, though, didn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe must fucking hate me now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t.\u201d </p><p>It\u2019s too dark to really read Dan\u2019s expression, but Phil can sense that he\u2019s being cast a very skeptical look. </p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t.\u201d He repeats. \u201cShe\u2019s just worried. About both of us. 'Cause, you know\u2026\u201d He trails off. He doesn\u2019t need to say it; Dan knows. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s better this way.\u201d Dan mumbles. \u201cI\u2019m a shit boyfriend, Phil. I\u2019m just like, a shit person altogether. I have no idea what I\u2019m doing with my life, I\u2019ve just as good as flunked out of law school. Some day I\u2019m gonna start to drag you down too much, this way you\u2019re off the hook. You can just\u2026 leave. No strings.\u201d</p><p>Phil doesn\u2019t respond. This is another conversation he\u2019s had a million times. Another conversation that just goes around in circles. It doesn\u2019t seem to matter how many times he tells Dan that it\u2019s too late for no strings. That\u2019s not something that works retroactively. Not for him. </p><p>It seems to make sense to Dan that they still fuck basically every week, that they still say<i> I love you,</i> but they somehow can\u2019t be together. Phil\u2019s not sure if they broke up because Dan just doesn\u2019t care, or if Dan thinks that <i>Phil</i> doesn\u2019t care. Surely it can\u2019t be that. How many times has he told Dan that he loves him in spite of everything, that he wants him complete with all of his flaws? The same way that Dan wants him\u2026 or wanted him, at one point. He doesn\u2019t know anymore. </p><p>Because he knows Dan isn\u2019t the type to suddenly stop caring about something, or someone. Dan cares a whole fucking lot. But something gets in the way sometimes. Something unreadable, that makes the light go out in his eyes. Phil knows he can\u2019t replace that light, he\u2019s tried. But god damn, he at least wants to help find something that can. </p><p>\u201cDoes this feel like no strings to you?\u201d Phil asks quietly. Maybe Dan will listen to himself, if he can\u2019t listen to Phil.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d </p><p>Phil waits a moment for him to elaborate, but he doesn\u2019t. \u201cMe neither. What if it stays that way?\u201d</p><p>Dan doesn\u2019t respond, but he does rest his cheek down on top of Phil\u2019s head when he scoots in closer. </p><p>They\u2019re both hanging onto something, surely. The question is whether they\u2019re hanging onto the same thing. </p><p>He\u2019s not so sure he wants to know.</p><p>*</p><p><i>for <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfTZwY5VPpShXmJM3HNLP7A\" target=\"_blank\">@phandomficfests</a> shuffle mode; song prompt: waiting game by banks</i><br></p>",

But the undeniable ache in his chest makes him feel like he really, really doesn&rsquo;t.</p><p>*</p><p>The soft, pitchy breath that Dan stifles into his shoulder when he finally bottoms out, after an agonizing minute of working himself slowly down on Phil&rsquo;s cock, is objectively the best sound in the world. He soaks it up and holds onto it every single time, on the dreaded chance that he might never get to hear it again. The possibility is always there. It could happen any day. </p><p>&ldquo;Fuck.&rdquo; Dan&rsquo;s nails dig deep into his shoulder blades. &ldquo;Give me a sec. I swear your dick got bigger since last time.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Last time was less than a week ago.&rdquo; Phil reminds him, deliberately letting his breath ghost over Dan&rsquo;s neck as he winds his arms securely around his waist. It has the desired effect; Dan shudders and relaxes a bit. &ldquo;And it definitely didn&rsquo;t. You&rsquo;re just not prepped enough, you got impatient.&rdquo;</p><p>He receives only a delayed <i>hmph</i> in response, and he has to smirk. Because Dan doesn&rsquo;t want to admit that he&rsquo;s right, but it&rsquo;s kind of impossible for either of them to deny.</p><p>&ldquo;Right, c'mere.&rdquo; His voice goes softer than intended and he slides one hand up to tangle into Dan&rsquo;s hair. Dan obliges and tilts his head before Phil can even tell him to. &ldquo;Relax.&rdquo; He murmurs in between hot, wet kisses to Dan&rsquo;s neck, particularly all the sensitive spots that he&rsquo;s had memorized for what feels like ages. &ldquo;You feel so fucking good.&rdquo; </p><p>He does. Dan&rsquo;s warmth clenching around him so tight that he can&rsquo;t move is actually bordering on too much. Bordering, because he doesn&rsquo;t think that 'too much&rsquo; is really a part of his vocabulary when it comes to Dan. With Dan, he always wants more. </p><p>So he chases it. </p><p>Instant gratification, that&rsquo;s what this is. That&rsquo;s why they do this. That&rsquo;s what he tells himself when Dan starts rocking against him, that&rsquo;s what he tells himself when he grabs onto Dan&rsquo;s hips hard enough to bruise and guides him down harder and faster, that&rsquo;s what he tells himself when Dan&rsquo;s panting and moaning and begging for more, that&rsquo;s what he tells himself when he flips them over and pounds into him with total abandon because he knows they&rsquo;re right on the limit. That&rsquo;s what he tells himself when Dan&rsquo;s legs start to shake and his eyes flutter shut and he clenches around him, and that&rsquo;s what he tells himself when his hips stutter and he buries himself deep inside one last time and collapses almost before the relief of his orgasm finishes washing over him. </p><p>Then he rolls off, so they&rsquo;re laid side by side with their bodies limp and boneless and their chests flushed and hearts pounding. Phil lets his eyes fall shut, then, because this is the part where they stop bullshitting themselves. </p><p>&ldquo;I love you.&rdquo; Dan whispers, and hands him a couple tissues. </p><p>He sighs, opens his eyes and hastily cleans off the mess of Dan&rsquo;s cum that&rsquo;s painted onto his chest and stomach. </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah. I love you too.&rdquo;</p><p>*</p><p>The only light in the room now comes from the cheap fairy lights that Dan&rsquo;s strung up on the wall behind his bed. They cast a dim glow onto the bottle of Malibu that Dan&rsquo;s rolling in between his hands - the one he keeps by the side of his bed that makes him look like an alcoholic, though it&rsquo;s really just there to stay safe from his housemates given their tendency to steal any liquor they can get their hands on. </p><p>&ldquo;You sure you don&rsquo;t want any?&rdquo; Dan offers, and Phil just shakes his head and slides down under the covers. &ldquo;Had enough earlier. Everyone kept fucking me over in Kings.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Explains why it took you so fucking long to get here.&rdquo; Dan takes a decent pull from the bottle and then sets it down before joining him under the covers. He holds an arm out and Phil curls into him, head resting on Dan&rsquo;s shoulder. </p><p>&ldquo;No, I tried to get here quick. Addy stopped me on the way out, though.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh.&rdquo; Dan&rsquo;s body stills, and for a few moments the room lapses into a tense silence. &ldquo;She told you not to come, I guess.&rdquo;</p><p>He doesn&rsquo;t deny it, because there&rsquo;s really no use. &ldquo;I came anyway, though, didn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She must fucking hate me now.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t.&rdquo; </p><p>It&rsquo;s too dark to really read Dan&rsquo;s expression, but Phil can sense that he&rsquo;s being cast a very skeptical look. </p><p>&ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t.&rdquo; He repeats. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s just worried. About both of us. 'Cause, you know&hellip;&rdquo; He trails off. He doesn&rsquo;t need to say it; Dan knows. </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s better this way.&rdquo; Dan mumbles. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a shit boyfriend, Phil. I&rsquo;m just like, a shit person altogether. I have no idea what I&rsquo;m doing with my life, I&rsquo;ve just as good as flunked out of law school. Some day I&rsquo;m gonna start to drag you down too much, this way you&rsquo;re off the hook. You can just&hellip; leave. No strings.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil doesn&rsquo;t respond. This is another conversation he&rsquo;s had a million times. Another conversation that just goes around in circles. It doesn&rsquo;t seem to matter how many times he tells Dan that it&rsquo;s too late for no strings. That&rsquo;s not something that works retroactively. Not for him. </p><p>It seems to make sense to Dan that they still fuck basically every week, that they still say<i> I love you,</i> but they somehow can&rsquo;t be together. Phil&rsquo;s not sure if they broke up because Dan just doesn&rsquo;t care, or if Dan thinks that <i>Phil</i> doesn&rsquo;t care. Surely it can&rsquo;t be that. How many times has he told Dan that he loves him in spite of everything, that he wants him complete with all of his flaws? The same way that Dan wants him&hellip; or wanted him, at one point. He doesn&rsquo;t know anymore. </p><p>Because he knows Dan isn&rsquo;t the type to suddenly stop caring about something, or someone. Dan cares a whole fucking lot. But something gets in the way sometimes. Something unreadable, that makes the light go out in his eyes. Phil knows he can&rsquo;t replace that light, he&rsquo;s tried. But god damn, he at least wants to help find something that can. </p><p>&ldquo;Does this feel like no strings to you?&rdquo; Phil asks quietly. Maybe Dan will listen to himself, if he can&rsquo;t listen to Phil.</p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; </p><p>Phil waits a moment for him to elaborate, but he doesn&rsquo;t. &ldquo;Me neither. What if it stays that way?&rdquo;</p><p>Dan doesn&rsquo;t respond, but he does rest his cheek down on top of Phil&rsquo;s head when he scoots in closer. </p><p>They&rsquo;re both hanging onto something, surely. The question is whether they&rsquo;re hanging onto the same thing. </p><p>He&rsquo;s not so sure he wants to know.</p><p>*</p><p><i>for <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfTZwY5VPpShXmJM3HNLP7A\" target=\"_blank\">@phandomficfests</a> shuffle mode; song prompt: waiting game by banks</i><br /></p>",

Not when he\u2019s pressed on his back with Phil laying over him in the bed of his truck, surrounded by thick wool and flannel blankets and old pillows that were once used for camping. </p><p>Maybe this idea was stupid. But Dan would never admit it. </p><p>They were in a field that was recently cut for the season, Phil\u2019s truck parked somewhere in-between being too open and also being in the middle of nowhere. The dirt road they took to even find this place hadn\u2019t seen a vehicle since Dan and Phil parked two hours before. </p><p>They were going to stargaze. Apparently some comet was going to be seen from where they lived and they wanted to experience it in a new way than just sitting on their porches and looking up at the sky. They drove thirty minutes away before Phil took a sudden detour and now here they were. </p><p>It was a bit chilly out, Dan did have to admit that as his sweatshirt started to become rustled under Phil\u2019s touches, his belly becoming exposed to the cool summer breeze. His eyes were closed, not even seeing the sky around them that they were supposed to be watching for. </p><p>He blames that on Phil mostly. </p><p>They had parked and gotten out of Phil\u2019s truck\u2014which he should probably stop referring to it as Phil\u2019s truck because that\u2019s not true, it\u2019s actually his brothers\u2014and climbed onto the bed. Phil had brought many thick blankets with him and cushioned the hard plastic underneath where they were sitting. The pillows were old, and slightly lingered with a musty smell. But all Dan could smell was the petrichor in the air from the rain shower earlier that day and the grass in the distance. </p><p>Phil\u2019s kisses were sweet, never forceful. Not even now as he was being a bit more eager to get his mouth on any part of Dan that it would reach. Their moulds together in perfect practice of being lovers for a little while now, although they haven\u2019t spoken those three words to each other yet. </p><p>Dan brings up his arms and wraps them around Phil\u2019s neck, pulling him closer as his body heat traveled through the fabric to Dan\u2019s cooled skin. Phil pulled back, his breath coming in patches as he struggled to catch it. Dan felt his lips curl into a smile. He loved being able to do this to Phil, make him so breathless he can\u2019t hardly catch up. </p><p>\u201cWhat are we doing?\u201d Dan asked. </p><p>\u201cSupposed to be watching the comets.\u201d Phil said with a chuckle. He sat back, disentangling Dan\u2019s arms from his neck. He sat back on his heels between Dan\u2019s legs and his hands placed themselves on Dan\u2019s hips, his thumbs smoothing over the soft fabric of his sweatpants. </p><p>\u201cNot doing much of that, are we?\u201d Dan asked, stretching a bit from the way his back was starting to already ache from the hard plastic under him. </p><p>Phil shook his head. \u201cKind of would prefer to just keep making out with you instead.\u201d </p><p>Dan let out a snort and reached his hands out, grabbing Phil\u2019s sweatshirt by the front and pulling him back down, reconnecting their lips. Somehow they got rolled over in the midst of this and Dan found himself straddling Phil, his legs bracketing either side of his hips. </p><p>\u201cI love when you\u2019re on top of me.\u201d Phil whispered between kisses, his breath ghosting Dan\u2019s lips. </p><p>\u201cI love when you\u2019re inside of me.\u201d Dan replies back, feeling arousal stir in his stomach as he slowly ground his hips against Phil\u2019s. Their breaths caught in their throats as they both groaned at the feeling. </p><p>\u201cDo you have a condom?\u201d Phil asked, pulling back after another sound kiss on Dan\u2019s lips. </p><p>Dan nodded. \u201cMy wallet.\u201d He says, sitting back and resting on Phil\u2019s hips. \u201cIt should be on the blankets somewhere. I took it out of my pocket when we climbed in.\u201d </p><p>Phil turned and ruffled through the blankets as Dan watched. When he found it, he pulled it from the blankets and opened it up, pulling out a condom and a small packet of lube that Dan tried to carry everywhere. </p><p>Dan was never one to do that\u2026just carry around condoms and other sexual necessities. But meeting Phil changed his outlook on all that. He loved having sex with Phil. The intimacy of it and the sharing and exploring of the others body. Dan never knew that sex could feel this way and he\u2019s a bit drunk on the feeling. </p><p>\u201cHow do you want to do this?\u201d Phil asks, looking up at Dan. \u201cDo you want to be on top or would you rather me be on top?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou on top.\u201d Dan answered. </p><p>Mostly because he kind of wanted to be wrapped in the blankets as the chill in the air got a little bit harsher and if he was on top, he couldn\u2019t really do that. </p><p>Phil nodded and they switched places, Phil now between his spread legs and Dan underneath him. Phil reached between them and gently pulled down Dan\u2019s sweatpants. The bite of the cool against his naked skin caused him to hiss a bit and Phil chuckled. \u201cLet\u2019s just remove our pants for this round.\u201d </p><p>Dan nodded because he definitely didn\u2019t want to take off his sweatshirt, even if he risked getting something on it. He erection laid hard against his stomach, leaving a small wet patch on the fabric of his sweatshirt. </p><p>Between him, Phil was just as hard, his cock flushed a deep red. Dan hummed in content. He loved everything about Phil from his head to his toes but he\u2019ll never get over how absolutely amazing Phil\u2019s cock was. It was the perfect size, length, and girth and it did more than satisfy Dan\u2019s needs. Granted, Dan loved Phil so much that it wouldn\u2019t actually have mattered to him what Phil looked like but this is definitely a plus. </p><p>Phil blushes when he sees the way Dan looks at him and Dan just flashes him a smirk before he hands Phil the packet of lube and Phil opens it, drizzling a little bit onto his fingers. </p><p>Dan will never get over Phil\u2019s fingers and the way that they feel inside of him. The first time Phil ever fingered Dan was when they were first testing the waters for anything sexual and Dan was pretty hooked on the way they felt inside of him. </p><p>He let out a whimper and a moan as he felt Phil press in another finger already. Despite the cool breeze, he was actually pretty relaxed given the situation so Phil was able to easily stretch and open him up. </p><p>A third finger made it\u2019s way past the other two and Dan let out a string of moans as Phil pressed against his prostate, causing Dan\u2019s back to arch and his hand to fly up by his head and fist the blankets under him. </p><p>When he felt Phil remove his fingers, he opened his eyes and looked up at Phil. His eyes were sparkling deep blue in the starlight and his hair was hanging a bit long over his forehead. But Dan wouldn\u2019t have it any other way. </p><p>He reached up, and placed his hand on Phil\u2019s jaw, rubbing his cheek with his thumb. Phil looked at him, and Dan felt his heart skip a beat. </p><p>He was so damn in love. </p><p>Phil opened the condom pocket and rolled the condom over his length as Dan watched and waited. When he was ready, Dan spread his legs a bit more and then let for Phil to adjust himself between them. He pressed the head of his cock to Dan\u2019s entrance and when he began to push it, Dan felt like all breath left his body. </p><p>He whimpered, his body feeling a tinge of pain from the intrusion but not enough to make him tell Phil to stop or slow down. His body adjusted fast and as Phil began to slowly move, Dan bit his lip and shut his eyes, relaxing his head into the pillow as he allowed for Phil to rock their bodies gently together. </p><p>Dan was normally the louder one of the two, his voice coming out as moans and whimpers as Phil remained silent until he came. Around them, it was silent. Nothing but the night air to whisper in their ears. </p><p>Dan didn\u2019t last long. He came with a whimper as his body shook and he grabbed onto Phil, pulling him as close as he could to his body. Phil came right after, bitting softly into Dan\u2019s shoulder as he cried out and then fell down beside him, pulling out as gently as he could. </p><p>When they both came down from their highs, Dan turned to Phil and kissed him with all of the energy he had. His hand came up and held Phil in place as he slotted their lips together. Phil\u2019s arm wrapped around Dan\u2019s waist and held him close. When Dan pulled back, he whispered the words. </p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d </p><p>Phil looked at him and pulled him into another kiss before whispering them back, making Dan tear up. He\u2019s never loved someone like he\u2019s loved Phil. And sure they were young\u2014only nineteen\u2014but that doesn\u2019t mean he can\u2019t fall in love. </p><p>They separated from each other long enough to get back into their pants. They climbed under a couple of the spare blankets Phil had brought and settled against each other as Dan laid his head on Phil\u2019s chest. </p><p>Not long after, they saw the comet flash across the sky and Dan smiled to himself as he felt his eyes drift shut. </p><p>Maybe this had been stupid\u2026but he\u2019ll never think so. </p>",

Phil reached between them and gently pulled down Dan\u2019s sweatpants. The bite of the cool against his naked skin caused him to hiss a bit and Phil chuckled. \u201cLet\u2019s just remove our pants for this round.\u201d </p><p>Dan nodded because he definitely didn\u2019t want to take off his sweatshirt, even if he risked getting something on it. He erection laid hard against his stomach, leaving a small wet patch on the fabric of his sweatshirt. </p><p>Between him, Phil was just as hard, his cock flushed a deep red. Dan hummed in content. He loved everything about Phil from his head to his toes but he\u2019ll never get over how absolutely amazing Phil\u2019s cock was. It was the perfect size, length, and girth and it did more than satisfy Dan\u2019s needs. Granted, Dan loved Phil so much that it wouldn\u2019t actually have mattered to him what Phil looked like but this is definitely a plus. </p><p>Phil blushes when he sees the way Dan looks at him and Dan just flashes him a smirk before he hands Phil the packet of lube and Phil opens it, drizzling a little bit onto his fingers. </p><p>Dan will never get over Phil\u2019s fingers and the way that they feel inside of him. The first time Phil ever fingered Dan was when they were first testing the waters for anything sexual and Dan was pretty hooked on the way they felt inside of him. </p><p>He let out a whimper and a moan as he felt Phil press in another finger already. Despite the cool breeze, he was actually pretty relaxed given the situation so Phil was able to easily stretch and open him up. </p><p>A third finger made it\u2019s way past the other two and Dan let out a string of moans as Phil pressed against his prostate, causing Dan\u2019s back to arch and his hand to fly up by his head and fist the blankets under him. </p><p>When he felt Phil remove his fingers, he opened his eyes and looked up at Phil. His eyes were sparkling deep blue in the starlight and his hair was hanging a bit long over his forehead. But Dan wouldn\u2019t have it any other way. </p><p>He reached up, and placed his hand on Phil\u2019s jaw, rubbing his cheek with his thumb. Phil looked at him, and Dan felt his heart skip a beat. </p><p>He was so damn in love. </p><p>Phil opened the condom pocket and rolled the condom over his length as Dan watched and waited. When he was ready, Dan spread his legs a bit more and then let for Phil to adjust himself between them. He pressed the head of his cock to Dan\u2019s entrance and when he began to push it, Dan felt like all breath left his body. </p><p>He whimpered, his body feeling a tinge of pain from the intrusion but not enough to make him tell Phil to stop or slow down. His body adjusted fast and as Phil began to slowly move, Dan bit his lip and shut his eyes, relaxing his head into the pillow as he allowed for Phil to rock their bodies gently together. </p><p>Dan was normally the louder one of the two, his voice coming out as moans and whimpers as Phil remained silent until he came. Around them, it was silent. Nothing but the night air to whisper in their ears. </p><p>Dan didn\u2019t last long. He came with a whimper as his body shook and he grabbed onto Phil, pulling him as close as he could to his body. Phil came right after, bitting softly into Dan\u2019s shoulder as he cried out and then fell down beside him, pulling out as gently as he could. </p><p>When they both came down from their highs, Dan turned to Phil and kissed him with all of the energy he had. His hand came up and held Phil in place as he slotted their lips together. Phil\u2019s arm wrapped around Dan\u2019s waist and held him close. When Dan pulled back, he whispered the words. </p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d </p><p>Phil looked at him and pulled him into another kiss before whispering them back, making Dan tear up. He\u2019s never loved someone like he\u2019s loved Phil. And sure they were young\u2014only nineteen\u2014but that doesn\u2019t mean he can\u2019t fall in love. </p><p>They separated from each other long enough to get back into their pants. They climbed under a couple of the spare blankets Phil had brought and settled against each other as Dan laid his head on Phil\u2019s chest. </p><p>Not long after, they saw the comet flash across the sky and Dan smiled to himself as he felt his eyes drift shut. </p><p>Maybe this had been stupid\u2026but he\u2019ll never think so. </p>",

Thank you both so much! </p> [[MORE]]<p>Maybe it was stupid. Maybe this entire idea was stupid and they shouldn\u2019t be doing this. But Dan doesn\u2019t feel that way. Not when he\u2019s pressed on his back with Phil laying over him in the bed of his truck, surrounded by thick wool and flannel blankets and old pillows that were once used for camping. </p><p>Maybe this idea was stupid. But Dan would never admit it. </p><p>They were in a field that was recently cut for the season, Phil\u2019s truck parked somewhere in-between being too open and also being in the middle of nowhere. The dirt road they took to even find this place hadn\u2019t seen a vehicle since Dan and Phil parked two hours before. </p><p>They were going to stargaze. Apparently some comet was going to be seen from where they lived and they wanted to experience it in a new way than just sitting on their porches and looking up at the sky. They drove thirty minutes away before Phil took a sudden detour and now here they were. </p><p>It was a bit chilly out, Dan did have to admit that as his sweatshirt started to become rustled under Phil\u2019s touches, his belly becoming exposed to the cool summer breeze. His eyes were closed, not even seeing the sky around them that they were supposed to be watching for. </p><p>He blames that on Phil mostly. </p><p>They had parked and gotten out of Phil\u2019s truck\u2014which he should probably stop referring to it as Phil\u2019s truck because that\u2019s not true, it\u2019s actually his brothers\u2014and climbed onto the bed. Phil had brought many thick blankets with him and cushioned the hard plastic underneath where they were sitting. The pillows were old, and slightly lingered with a musty smell. But all Dan could smell was the petrichor in the air from the rain shower earlier that day and the grass in the distance. </p><p>Phil\u2019s kisses were sweet, never forceful. Not even now as he was being a bit more eager to get his mouth on any part of Dan that it would reach. Their moulds together in perfect practice of being lovers for a little while now, although they haven\u2019t spoken those three words to each other yet. </p><p>Dan brings up his arms and wraps them around Phil\u2019s neck, pulling him closer as his body heat traveled through the fabric to Dan\u2019s cooled skin. Phil pulled back, his breath coming in patches as he struggled to catch it. Dan felt his lips curl into a smile. He loved being able to do this to Phil, make him so breathless he can\u2019t hardly catch up. </p><p>\u201cWhat are we doing?\u201d Dan asked. </p><p>\u201cSupposed to be watching the comets.\u201d Phil said with a chuckle. He sat back, disentangling Dan\u2019s arms from his neck. He sat back on his heels between Dan\u2019s legs and his hands placed themselves on Dan\u2019s hips, his thumbs smoothing over the soft fabric of his sweatpants. </p><p>\u201cNot doing much of that, are we?\u201d Dan asked, stretching a bit from the way his back was starting to already ache from the hard plastic under him. </p><p>Phil shook his head. \u201cKind of would prefer to just keep making out with you instead.\u201d </p><p>Dan let out a snort and reached his hands out, grabbing Phil\u2019s sweatshirt by the front and pulling him back down, reconnecting their lips. Somehow they got rolled over in the midst of this and Dan found himself straddling Phil, his legs bracketing either side of his hips. </p><p>\u201cI love when you\u2019re on top of me.\u201d Phil whispered between kisses, his breath ghosting Dan\u2019s lips. </p><p>\u201cI love when you\u2019re inside of me.\u201d Dan replies back, feeling arousal stir in his stomach as he slowly ground his hips against Phil\u2019s. Their breaths caught in their throats as they both groaned at the feeling. </p><p>\u201cDo you have a condom?\u201d Phil asked, pulling back after another sound kiss on Dan\u2019s lips. </p><p>Dan nodded. \u201cMy wallet.\u201d He says, sitting back and resting on Phil\u2019s hips. \u201cIt should be on the blankets somewhere. I took it out of my pocket when we climbed in.\u201d </p><p>Phil turned and ruffled through the blankets as Dan watched. When he found it, he pulled it from the blankets and opened it up, pulling out a condom and a small packet of lube that Dan tried to carry everywhere. </p><p>Dan was never one to do that\u2026just carry around condoms and other sexual necessities.

Phil looked at him, and Dan felt his heart skip a beat. </p><p>He was so damn in love. </p><p>Phil opened the condom pocket and rolled the condom over his length as Dan watched and waited. When he was ready, Dan spread his legs a bit more and then let for Phil to adjust himself between them. He pressed the head of his cock to Dan&rsquo;s entrance and when he began to push it, Dan felt like all breath left his body. </p><p>He whimpered, his body feeling a tinge of pain from the intrusion but not enough to make him tell Phil to stop or slow down. His body adjusted fast and as Phil began to slowly move, Dan bit his lip and shut his eyes, relaxing his head into the pillow as he allowed for Phil to rock their bodies gently together. </p><p>Dan was normally the louder one of the two, his voice coming out as moans and whimpers as Phil remained silent until he came. Around them, it was silent. Nothing but the night air to whisper in their ears. </p><p>Dan didn&rsquo;t last long. He came with a whimper as his body shook and he grabbed onto Phil, pulling him as close as he could to his body. Phil came right after, bitting softly into Dan&rsquo;s shoulder as he cried out and then fell down beside him, pulling out as gently as he could. </p><p>When they both came down from their highs, Dan turned to Phil and kissed him with all of the energy he had. His hand came up and held Phil in place as he slotted their lips together. Phil&rsquo;s arm wrapped around Dan&rsquo;s waist and held him close. When Dan pulled back, he whispered the words. </p><p>&ldquo;I love you.&rdquo; </p><p>Phil looked at him and pulled him into another kiss before whispering them back, making Dan tear up. He&rsquo;s never loved someone like he&rsquo;s loved Phil. And sure they were young&mdash;only nineteen&mdash;but that doesn&rsquo;t mean he can&rsquo;t fall in love. </p><p>They separated from each other long enough to get back into their pants. They climbed under a couple of the spare blankets Phil had brought and settled against each other as Dan laid his head on Phil&rsquo;s chest. </p><p>Not long after, they saw the comet flash across the sky and Dan smiled to himself as he felt his eyes drift shut. </p><p>Maybe this had been stupid&hellip;but he&rsquo;ll never think so. </p>",

It had started off as a promising day; the barista had gotten his coffee order right, he got on the tube on time, and he had been able to finish all of his work early. But opening the shiny red envelope had turned what would have been a nice, relaxing evening at home into him standing in the middle of his kitchen with years of memories flooding his brain.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t thought about YouTube in years, at least not in the sense of being a creator. He still watched the occasional cat video or a funny late night skit, but being a \u2018YouTuber\u2019 wasn\u2019t his life anymore, something that the invitation did not seem to take to mind.</p><p><i>\u201dJoin us for YouTube\u2019s 10 year celebration!\u201d</i></p><!-- more --><p>It gave a time, date, and location that Phil did his best not to commit to memory. He had no desire to go to a building he used to frequent and see people who he used to consider his friends, but ever since he stopped making videos hadn\u2019t bothered to try and keep in touch with him.</p><p>And maybe he hadn\u2019t tried that hard either, but everything that had to do with YouTube made him think of Dan, and that was at the very top of his \u2018things to avoid thinking about\u2019 list.</p><p>Before he can stop it, his mind floods with memories of said person he avoided thinking about. Thoughts of dimples and big coffee-colored eyes. Holidays on the beach and shitty Manchester apartments with a balcony that they spent more time on than they did inside.</p><p>An ache pulls at his chest and he throws the fancy piece of card stock in the bin.</p><p>-</p><p>It\u2019s Cornelia who brings it up the next day when he\u2019s sitting at his desk and trying to mind his own business. She pops her fiery, red head in and sits on the spare chair he keeps tucked in the corner of his tiny office.</p><p>\u201cDid you get that thing from YouTube for their ten year anniversary?\u201d</p><p>Phil pretends to ignore her, focusing extra hard on his computer screen, but he should know that she isn&rsquo;t going to let him get away with it that easy.</p><p>\u201cPhilip, I\u2019m talking to youuu!\u201d she croons, waving her hand in his face. He loves her dearly, but she\u2019s a lot like Martyn in the most annoying ways.</p><p>\u201cYes, I got the invitation, and no, I\u2019m not going.\u201d</p><p>She pouts and crosses her arms. \u201cWell, why not? Wouldn&rsquo;t you like to see all your old friends?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s smart and doesn\u2019t say \u2018Dan\u2019 because she knows that will set Phil off. But she still pokes and prods at him until he answers.</p><p>\u201cThey were barely my friends then, and they certainly aren\u2019t now.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s being grumpy and petulant, but the last thing he wants to talk about this right now. He\u2019s got a migraine building, and he just wants to go home and think of things that are decidedly <i>not</i> about his old life and the people who used to be in it.</p><p>\u201cStill, though,\u201d she continues, \u201cit would be fun. Plus, I\u2019m sure you\u2019d get a bunch of cool swag.\u201d</p><p>Phil cringes, his nose scrunching up. \u201cGod, please don\u2019t say \u2018swag,\u2019 it makes you sound like some twelve year old fuckboy.\u201d</p><p>She cringes this time, but her melodic laugh follows.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re such a grump sometimes. I miss when you were fun.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s said as a joke, and logically he knows that, but the comment still stings. He knows that things are different. Knows that he used to be a lot more carefree and lively, but his life is different now.</p><p>He\u2019s different now.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going home. I have a headache. I\u2019ll text Martyn and let him know.\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t wait for her reply, just packs his laptop and some extra work into his backpack and heads outside. The air is cold and has the stench of London that he still isn\u2019t used to, but he doesn\u2019t feel quite as stifled anymore. He gazes up into the dreary sky and feels an ache in his chest that he had mostly been great at ignoring for the past three years.</p><p>-</p><p>Instead of going home like he originally planned, he spots a quaint little coffee shop a few blocks down from work and decides that maybe some caffeine will help his headache.</p><p>It\u2019s quiet inside, thankfully, and he\u2019s able to go straight to the counter and order a too-sweet latte and snag one of the plushy arm chairs in the corner by the window. He sips the scorching beverage slowly and tries to relax. His shoulders and neck feel too tense, and it\u2019s doing nothing to help the dull throb of his head.</p><p>He stares out the window and people watches for bit, always interested in the coming and goings of those around him. He used to like making up stories about all the passerby. But that was a long time ago, when his life was chaotic and full of dimpled smiles and Manchester macchiatos.</p><p>Someone walks by as he\u2019s gazing idly out to the street and it makes his heart stop. He knows exactly who it is, and he hopes beyond hope that they don\u2019t stop into this particular shop. But of course the universe isn\u2019t that kind.</p><p>Dan walks in, taller and more broad than Phil remembers. His hair is curly now, too, and Phil can\u2019t help but wonder if he just didn\u2019t have time to straighten it or if that\u2019s just how he wears it now.</p><p>Dan walks up to the counter, and the shop is so small he can hear what Dan orders and isn\u2019t all that surprised that it\u2019s tea. He always preferred that to coffee, Phil\u2019s brain traitorously supplies. He doesn\u2019t want to remember those tiny little facts about someone that he does everything in his power to avoid.</p><p>As he busies himself with trying to become invisible and melt into the chair he\u2019s in, Dan glances around the shop and his eyes fall on Phil. He doesn\u2019t think he\u2019s imagining the way that his breath hitches and the tug of a frown on his lips.</p><p>He moves Phil\u2019s way once the barista hands him his cup, and instead of doing what Phil prays he will do and walk out the door, he approaches Phil where he\u2019s curled into a ball on the chair.</p><p>\u201cPhil.\u201d</p><p>Phil can\u2019t quite put his finger on what tone Dan uses, but he knows there is at least a tiny hint of surprise and maybe even a touch of anger.</p><p>\u201cUh. Hi.\u201d</p><p>Dan stares back, unimpressed. He\u2019s not entirely sure what Dan expects of him right now, in the middle of a coffee shop in broad daylight. Now is not the time for apologies and declarations of love. He severely just wants to stand up and leave, but he knows his mum would have his hide at being so rude.</p><p>\u201cHow have you been?\u201d It\u2019s a polite platitude that doesn\u2019t encompass half of the questions churning in Phil head. He wants to know everything, every tiny insignificant thing that has happened in the time that\u2019s passed, but he won\u2019t ask. He\u2019s nothing if not stubborn.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t seen you in three years. You haven\u2019t called, texted, <i>anything,</i> and you ask me how I am?\u201d</p><p>If he only listened to the tone of his voice, it might be easy to think that they were having a polite conversation about the weather. But Phil can hear the words, too, and they cut right down to the bone. Yes, everything Dan said was true, but he\u2019s not the only one who did wrong in this situation.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one who left.\u201d It wasn\u2019t what Phil had intended to say, but the words were out before he could stop them.</p><p>Dan retracts like he\u2019s been slapped in the face, and he looks like he\u2019s about to say something cutting when someone who Phil hadn\u2019t even realized was here walks up and slips his arm through Dan\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cHello, love,\u201d the man says to Dan, snapping both of their attention to him.</p><p>Dan whips his head around to look at the newcomer and glances back to Phil. It\u2019s tense for a second before Dan seems to make some sort of internal decision, tightening his elbow around the man\u2019s arm and pulling it closer to his body. It says more than any words could.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d the stranger says, finally glancing at Phil. \u201cI\u2019m Ron.\u201d</p><p>He untangles himself from Dan\u2019s arm and moves forward to shake Phil\u2019s hand. He stares at it for half a second before taking it in his own trembling hand and shaking it.</p><p>\u201cPhil.\u201d</p><p>His bright smile falters a little bit, and a pit opens up in Phil\u2019s stomach.</p><p>\u201cOh. You\u2019re <i>that</i> Phil.\u201d</p><p>His eyes immediately move to Dan, but he looks away before Phil can read into his reaction.</p><p>\u201cUm, I guess?\u201d</p><p>Ron moves back to Dan\u2019s side, a united front against Phil, and his smile is a bit tighter this time.</p><p>\u201cWell, it was lovely to meet you, but we have to be going.\u201d</p><p>He pulls on Dan\u2019s arm and he follows Ron out of the building, but he keeps his eyes on Phil and doesn\u2019t break the eye contact until he\u2019s out the door and heading in the opposite direction of the shop.</p><p>When he gets home, Phil opens the lid to the bin and stares at the invitation still laying on the top innocently, as if it hasn\u2019t been causing Phil stress and worry since it arrived in the mail yesterday. He doesn\u2019t retrieve it, because he has no desire to get bin juice all over himself, but he does take a picture with his phone so he has the place and date, even though he tells himself he isn\u2019t going.</p><p>He can\u2019t pretend he\u2019s not thinking about it, though. Seeing Dan sparked something in him that he hasn\u2019t been able to tamper down since. Yes, he had known they were living in the same city now, but he had hoped that in a city of over eight million people, he would hopefully be able to avoid ever seeing him. He should have known that he couldn\u2019t continue to be so lucky.</p><p>He takes a few tablets and lays down, hoping dreamless sleep comes to him, but when he finally does succumb to his heavy eyelids, it\u2019s doe eyes and dimpled smiles that he dreams of.</p><p>-</p><p>Saturday.</p><p>It\u2019s the day that looms heavy over Phil\u2019s head the rest of the week. He knows the date, time, and place of the \u2018Celebration\u2019 almost as well as he knows his name. Sometime Thursday night is the night he finally gives up the pretense of pretending he didn\u2019t care or that he would possibly go. The temptation of seeing Dan again is too great, although he will never utter those words aloud, even to himself.</p><p>Cornelia doesn\u2019t bring it up again, thankfully. They go about their work, polite if not a bit strained (mostly on Phil\u2019s part), and the rest of the week is perfectly average.</p><p>Except for the fact that he barely sleeps, and when he does, Dan is all that he dreams of. Once upon a time, that was a good thing. Once upon a time, there was no reason for Phil to dread reliving old memories of them together.</p><p>By the time Friday rolls around, he\u2019s a bit of an actual mess and spends the whole night combing through his closet to find something that he can wear, even though he isn\u2019t going to the party. He\u2019s not, he tells himself, even as he leaves the house and runs into Topman to find an outfit that he thinks will do a good job of saying, \u2018Yes, I have a good job and am doing just fine by myself, thank you very much.\u2019</p><p>He barely sleeps at all that night, and when he wakes up on Saturday at nearly 5 am, he gets up and does what he absolutely despises: goes for a run.</p><p>It\u2019s terrible and torturous, but he gets through the whole thing, only having to stop and catch his breath twice. He hadn\u2019t properly gone for a run in years. When he and Dan first split, he ran all the time since it was the only way to get his head out of the cloud of despair and misery it had called home for quite some time.</p><p>He stops by Tesco and grabs some things for breakfast, figuring he might as well make pancakes if he\u2019s going to be awake at this god awful hour. Flour, butter, milk, some chocolate for later, more instant coffee, some fruit - he wonders around the store for entirely longer than necessary, plonking random items into the cart, which he regrets as soon as he remembers he has to carry it all the way home.</p><p>-</p><p>It\u2019s loud in the event center YouTube booked, not even because there are tons of people, just because the people here are all too loud and boisterous. Instead of walking around and socializing, Phil goes straight to the bar and orders a shot. The tequila burns as it runs down his throat, and he is reminded that he really should stop consuming things that he\u2019s allergic to.</p><p>There are people starting to approach him, he can feel it from his perch on his stool at the bar, and he tenses, not wanting to have to talk to anyone tonight. Well, maybe not <i>anyone</i>.</p><p>\u201cPhil! You didn\u2019t tell me you were coming!\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s PJ, and he slaps Phil\u2019s back, smile too wide for his face. Sophie is next to him, giving him a warm smile, and he relaxes a little.</p><p>\u201cYeah, sorry. I wasn\u2019t sure if I was going to or not.\u201d</p><p>Out of everyone Phil used to associate with, PJ was the only person he kept in semi-regular contact with; their friendship expanded past the imaginary walls of the internet.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m glad you came! Did you want to sit at our table for dinner?\u201d</p><p>Phil accepts the offer, relieved he won\u2019t have to sit by himself or with a bunch of the vloggers he wasn\u2019t all that fond of. He takes his place next to PJ and lets him talk, happy to just listen for now.</p><p>\u201cDan!\u201d</p><p>Phil\u2019s head turns so fast, he gets a crick in it and winces in pain.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Dan says, taking a seat at the table, Ron sitting next to him.</p><p>\u201cYou showed! I thought you said you weren\u2019t going to.\u201d</p><p>Dan glances at Phil quickly before replying, but it\u2019s so fast Phil\u2019s not sure if he imagined it or not.</p><p>\u201cWell, I thought it might be worth coming.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s ambiguous and his tone is vague, leaving Phil feeling irritated. If he had something to say, why not just come out and say it? Although, he was often told that he needed to take his own advice.</p><p>Dinner comes and puts a pause on the awkward conversation that PJ, Sophie, and Ron had mostly been keeping up. Phil can feel Dan\u2019s eyes on him far too often, choosing to avert his own gaze. Part of him wants to confront Dan, the other just wants to leave and forget that he had ever thought coming here would be a good idea.</p><p>-</p><p>By the time the empty plates are taken away and the speakers take the stage, Phil\u2019s got a headache throbbing at the back of his head, and his eyes are starting to get droopy thanks to his inappropriate wake up time.</p><p>The speaker is talking about how much Youtube has grown and how happy they are that everyone is attending, and it sounds a lot like white noise to Phil, only serving to make his eyes droop more. The advantage of the room being darkened, though, is that he can watch Dan out of the corner of his eye without it being conspicuous.</p><p>He\u2019s just as beautiful as he was back then, maybe even more so. Everything that had been delicate and understated about Dan is broad and bold now. His hair, the way the constellation of freckles dots across his cheeks. His fingers and hands are bigger now, and Phil can feel a tug in his chest of the thought of smaller, soft hands clasping his own. He drags his eyes away because he really, really doesn\u2019t want to have a breakdown in the middle of this party in front of semi-strangers and <i>especially</i> not in front of Dan.</p><p>He mostly has himself under control, but then there is a slide show playing on the screen onstage and Phil\u2019s breath leaves his lungs in a quick huff. They are showing pictures of everyone throughout the years, and the third picture covering the screen is of them.</p><p>It\u2019s an old one - the two of them with a group of others under a waterfall in Jamaica. Their arms are wrapped around each other, smiles wide across their faces. He\u2019s transported to hot sandy beaches, dazzling blue waters, and crisp white sheets that felt heavenly against their skin while they laid tangled together after sex.</p><p>Everything hits Phil all at once and suddenly the spacious room is stifling. He gets up and leaves abruptly, not bothering to apologize or provide any explanations; he\u2019s afraid of what would leave his mouth if he opened it.</p><p>-</p><p>It\u2019s beginning to rain outside, tiny drops of water splattering on the pavement, but Phil stands outside anyway, leaning against the sleek, modern walls of the building. He\u2019s not sure when he started crying, but there are tears leaving little wet spots on his dress shirt along with the rain.</p><p>The door opens somewhere to the right of him and he doesn\u2019t look up even as a pair of expensive looking boots stop in front of him. He doesn\u2019t have to look up to know that it\u2019s Dan. No other person he\u2019s ever met would like the studded monstrosities that Dan always had a fondness for.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never understood why you liked such ugly shoes,\u201d Phil says, keeping his eyes on the ground.</p><p>\u201cThese are Alexander McQueen\u2019s, Phil, have some respect.\u201d</p><p>He knows that tone, he\u2019s heard it thousands of times: exasperated with a hint of fondness. It does nothing to help him stifle the tears still running down his face.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure they cost more than your rent, right?\u201d He hates the way that the his voice cracks a little, but Dan lets out a little chuckle and he\u2019s more relieved than he has a right to be.</p><p>\u201cYou still shop at Topman, you can\u2019t give me any crap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTopman is great, you\u2019re just a designer snob.\u201d He forces out a little laugh so that Dan knows he\u2019s not trying to be a dick.</p><p>When he finally looks up, he almost wishes he hadn\u2019t. Somehow Dan is even prettier in the rain, something he\u2019s not sure how he never properly realized. He wants to start sobbing, feeling all of the things he\u2019s been trying to bury for the past three years.</p><p>\u201cI live in London now.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s not sure why this is what comes out of his mouth, but he\u2019s pleasantly surprised by Dan\u2019s smile. It\u2019s not a full smile, no dimples, but it\u2019s something.</p><p>\u201cI know. PJ told me.\u201d</p><p>Freaking PJ and his big mouth.</p><p>\u201cI should have told you. And I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t. I\u2019m sorry about a lot of things.\u201d</p><p>The hitch in his breath isn\u2019t loud enough to hear, but Phil is still in tune enough with Dan\u2019s body that he can recognize his reaction by the way his chest expands quickly and his lips purse a little like he\u2019s trying not to cry.</p><p>\u201cYou could have come with me, you know that, right? I didn\u2019t want to go alone, and I didn\u2019t want to leave you, but you were so god damn stubborn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Phil breaths. \u201cI was young and scared and - I don\u2019t even know. I don\u2019t want to give you a bunch of bullshit excuses, you deserve more than that. I just want you to know that I <i>am</i> sorry.\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t think he\u2019s imagining the way that Dan\u2019s eyes are shining in the light from the nearest lamp post.</p><p>\u201cI hated you for a really long time.\u201d</p><p>Phil just nods, not even remotely shocked by this. It\u2019s what he deserves, really.</p><p>\u201cBut I got tired of that. I don\u2019t want to hate you, I love you too much for that.\u201d</p><p>Phil definitely can\u2019t breath now. The words leave a ball of emotion stuck in his throat and he\u2019s rendered speechless.</p><p>\u201cBut what about Ron?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s my friend. My best friend, really.\u201d He doesn\u2019t think he deserves to feel the relief that he does from those words, nor the spike of jealousy he feels at someone else being called Dan\u2019s best friend. \u201cHe was the first person I met in London and he took me under his wing. I\u2019ve spent a lot of time crying on his shoulder about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDan, I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI -\u201d he starts and then has to stop as a shuddering breath leaves him.</p><p>Phil suddenly remembers that they are both still standing in the rain, probably ruining both of their clothes, but he doesn\u2019t care. He doesn\u2019t want to break whatever spell it is that seems to be cast between them. Something is happening here, and Phil won\u2019t risk ruining it.</p><p>\u201cI knew that you wouldn\u2019t want to leave Manchester. I knew when I asked you to move to London that you would say no, and it was my decision to leave. I could have given you more time, I could have tried to compromise, but I didn\u2019t and that is on me. I know that I\u2019ve made you feel like it was all you and it was your fault that things ended, but it\u2019s on me, too.\u201d</p><p>Phil\u2019s not sure what to say back. There are so many words on the tip of his tongue, but none feel right. He wants to say that he should have been braver, should have tried to make things work, even long distance, but those things are only the tip of the iceberg of the things he feels.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to go get a coffee? Maybe talk a little? I have so much to say, and I just don\u2019t know how to. I\u2019ve missed you so much and I haven\u2019t stopped thinking about you, even when I didn\u2019t want to. You\u2019ve been every thought in my brain since you left.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s no reply, only Dan surging forward and capturing Phil\u2019s lips in his own.</p><p>It\u2019s like coming home after a harrowing journey and being engulfed in all the things you love.

He had no desire to go to a building he used to frequent and see people who he used to consider his friends, but ever since he stopped making videos hadn\u2019t bothered to try and keep in touch with him.</p><p>And maybe he hadn\u2019t tried that hard either, but everything that had to do with YouTube made him think of Dan, and that was at the very top of his \u2018things to avoid thinking about\u2019 list.</p><p>Before he can stop it, his mind floods with memories of said person he avoided thinking about. Thoughts of dimples and big coffee-colored eyes. Holidays on the beach and shitty Manchester apartments with a balcony that they spent more time on than they did inside.</p><p>An ache pulls at his chest and he throws the fancy piece of card stock in the bin.</p><p>-</p><p>It\u2019s Cornelia who brings it up the next day when he\u2019s sitting at his desk and trying to mind his own business. She pops her fiery, red head in and sits on the spare chair he keeps tucked in the corner of his tiny office.</p><p>\u201cDid you get that thing from YouTube for their ten year anniversary?\u201d</p><p>Phil pretends to ignore her, focusing extra hard on his computer screen, but he should know that she isn\u2019t going to let him get away with it that easy.</p><p>\u201cPhilip, I\u2019m talking to youuu!\u201d she croons, waving her hand in his face. He loves her dearly, but she\u2019s a lot like Martyn in the most annoying ways.</p><p>\u201cYes, I got the invitation, and no, I\u2019m not going.\u201d</p><p>She pouts and crosses her arms. \u201cWell, why not? Wouldn\u2019t you like to see all your old friends?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s smart and doesn\u2019t say \u2018Dan\u2019 because she knows that will set Phil off. But she still pokes and prods at him until he answers.</p><p>\u201cThey were barely my friends then, and they certainly aren\u2019t now.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s being grumpy and petulant, but the last thing he wants to talk about this right now. He\u2019s got a migraine building, and he just wants to go home and think of things that are decidedly <i>not</i> about his old life and the people who used to be in it.</p><p>\u201cStill, though,\u201d she continues, \u201cit would be fun. Plus, I\u2019m sure you\u2019d get a bunch of cool swag.\u201d</p><p>Phil cringes, his nose scrunching up. \u201cGod, please don\u2019t say \u2018swag,\u2019 it makes you sound like some twelve year old fuckboy.\u201d</p><p>She cringes this time, but her melodic laugh follows.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re such a grump sometimes. I miss when you were fun.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s said as a joke, and logically he knows that, but the comment still stings. He knows that things are different. Knows that he used to be a lot more carefree and lively, but his life is different now.</p><p>He\u2019s different now.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going home. I have a headache. I\u2019ll text Martyn and let him know.\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t wait for her reply, just packs his laptop and some extra work into his backpack and heads outside. The air is cold and has the stench of London that he still isn\u2019t used to, but he doesn\u2019t feel quite as stifled anymore. He gazes up into the dreary sky and feels an ache in his chest that he had mostly been great at ignoring for the past three years.</p><p>-</p><p>Instead of going home like he originally planned, he spots a quaint little coffee shop a few blocks down from work and decides that maybe some caffeine will help his headache.</p><p>It\u2019s quiet inside, thankfully, and he\u2019s able to go straight to the counter and order a too-sweet latte and snag one of the plushy arm chairs in the corner by the window. He sips the scorching beverage slowly and tries to relax. His shoulders and neck feel too tense, and it\u2019s doing nothing to help the dull throb of his head.</p><p>He stares out the window and people watches for bit, always interested in the coming and goings of those around him. He used to like making up stories about all the passerby. But that was a long time ago, when his life was chaotic and full of dimpled smiles and Manchester macchiatos.</p><p>Someone walks by as he\u2019s gazing idly out to the street and it makes his heart stop. He knows exactly who it is, and he hopes beyond hope that they don\u2019t stop into this particular shop. But of course the universe isn\u2019t that kind.</p><p>Dan walks in, taller and more broad than Phil remembers. His hair is curly now, too, and Phil can\u2019t help but wonder if he just didn\u2019t have time to straighten it or if that\u2019s just how he wears it now.</p><p>Dan walks up to the counter, and the shop is so small he can hear what Dan orders and isn\u2019t all that surprised that it\u2019s tea. He always preferred that to coffee, Phil\u2019s brain traitorously supplies. He doesn\u2019t want to remember those tiny little facts about someone that he does everything in his power to avoid.</p><p>As he busies himself with trying to become invisible and melt into the chair he\u2019s in, Dan glances around the shop and his eyes fall on Phil. He doesn\u2019t think he\u2019s imagining the way that his breath hitches and the tug of a frown on his lips.</p><p>He moves Phil\u2019s way once the barista hands him his cup, and instead of doing what Phil prays he will do and walk out the door, he approaches Phil where he\u2019s curled into a ball on the chair.</p><p>\u201cPhil.\u201d</p><p>Phil can\u2019t quite put his finger on what tone Dan uses, but he knows there is at least a tiny hint of surprise and maybe even a touch of anger.</p><p>\u201cUh. Hi.\u201d</p><p>Dan stares back, unimpressed. He\u2019s not entirely sure what Dan expects of him right now, in the middle of a coffee shop in broad daylight. Now is not the time for apologies and declarations of love. He severely just wants to stand up and leave, but he knows his mum would have his hide at being so rude.</p><p>\u201cHow have you been?\u201d It\u2019s a polite platitude that doesn\u2019t encompass half of the questions churning in Phil head. He wants to know everything, every tiny insignificant thing that has happened in the time that\u2019s passed, but he won\u2019t ask. He\u2019s nothing if not stubborn.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t seen you in three years. You haven\u2019t called, texted, <i>anything,</i> and you ask me how I am?\u201d</p><p>If he only listened to the tone of his voice, it might be easy to think that they were having a polite conversation about the weather. But Phil can hear the words, too, and they cut right down to the bone. Yes, everything Dan said was true, but he\u2019s not the only one who did wrong in this situation.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one who left.\u201d It wasn\u2019t what Phil had intended to say, but the words were out before he could stop them.</p><p>Dan retracts like he\u2019s been slapped in the face, and he looks like he\u2019s about to say something cutting when someone who Phil hadn\u2019t even realized was here walks up and slips his arm through Dan\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cHello, love,\u201d the man says to Dan, snapping both of their attention to him.</p><p>Dan whips his head around to look at the newcomer and glances back to Phil. It\u2019s tense for a second before Dan seems to make some sort of internal decision, tightening his elbow around the man\u2019s arm and pulling it closer to his body. It says more than any words could.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d the stranger says, finally glancing at Phil. \u201cI\u2019m Ron.\u201d</p><p>He untangles himself from Dan\u2019s arm and moves forward to shake Phil\u2019s hand. He stares at it for half a second before taking it in his own trembling hand and shaking it.</p><p>\u201cPhil.\u201d</p><p>His bright smile falters a little bit, and a pit opens up in Phil\u2019s stomach.</p><p>\u201cOh. You\u2019re <i>that</i> Phil.\u201d</p><p>His eyes immediately move to Dan, but he looks away before Phil can read into his reaction.</p><p>\u201cUm, I guess?\u201d</p><p>Ron moves back to Dan\u2019s side, a united front against Phil, and his smile is a bit tighter this time.</p><p>\u201cWell, it was lovely to meet you, but we have to be going.\u201d</p><p>He pulls on Dan\u2019s arm and he follows Ron out of the building, but he keeps his eyes on Phil and doesn\u2019t break the eye contact until he\u2019s out the door and heading in the opposite direction of the shop.</p><p>When he gets home, Phil opens the lid to the bin and stares at the invitation still laying on the top innocently, as if it hasn\u2019t been causing Phil stress and worry since it arrived in the mail yesterday. He doesn\u2019t retrieve it, because he has no desire to get bin juice all over himself, but he does take a picture with his phone so he has the place and date, even though he tells himself he isn\u2019t going.</p><p>He can\u2019t pretend he\u2019s not thinking about it, though. Seeing Dan sparked something in him that he hasn\u2019t been able to tamper down since. Yes, he had known they were living in the same city now, but he had hoped that in a city of over eight million people, he would hopefully be able to avoid ever seeing him. He should have known that he couldn\u2019t continue to be so lucky.</p><p>He takes a few tablets and lays down, hoping dreamless sleep comes to him, but when he finally does succumb to his heavy eyelids, it\u2019s doe eyes and dimpled smiles that he dreams of.</p><p>-</p><p>Saturday.</p><p>It\u2019s the day that looms heavy over Phil\u2019s head the rest of the week. He knows the date, time, and place of the \u2018Celebration\u2019 almost as well as he knows his name. Sometime Thursday night is the night he finally gives up the pretense of pretending he didn\u2019t care or that he would possibly go. The temptation of seeing Dan again is too great, although he will never utter those words aloud, even to himself.</p><p>Cornelia doesn\u2019t bring it up again, thankfully. They go about their work, polite if not a bit strained (mostly on Phil\u2019s part), and the rest of the week is perfectly average.</p><p>Except for the fact that he barely sleeps, and when he does, Dan is all that he dreams of. Once upon a time, that was a good thing. Once upon a time, there was no reason for Phil to dread reliving old memories of them together.</p><p>By the time Friday rolls around, he\u2019s a bit of an actual mess and spends the whole night combing through his closet to find something that he can wear, even though he isn\u2019t going to the party. He\u2019s not, he tells himself, even as he leaves the house and runs into Topman to find an outfit that he thinks will do a good job of saying, \u2018Yes, I have a good job and am doing just fine by myself, thank you very much.\u2019</p><p>He barely sleeps at all that night, and when he wakes up on Saturday at nearly 5 am, he gets up and does what he absolutely despises: goes for a run.</p><p>It\u2019s terrible and torturous, but he gets through the whole thing, only having to stop and catch his breath twice. He hadn\u2019t properly gone for a run in years. When he and Dan first split, he ran all the time since it was the only way to get his head out of the cloud of despair and misery it had called home for quite some time.</p><p>He stops by Tesco and grabs some things for breakfast, figuring he might as well make pancakes if he\u2019s going to be awake at this god awful hour. Flour, butter, milk, some chocolate for later, more instant coffee, some fruit - he wonders around the store for entirely longer than necessary, plonking random items into the cart, which he regrets as soon as he remembers he has to carry it all the way home.</p><p>-</p><p>It\u2019s loud in the event center YouTube booked, not even because there are tons of people, just because the people here are all too loud and boisterous. Instead of walking around and socializing, Phil goes straight to the bar and orders a shot. The tequila burns as it runs down his throat, and he is reminded that he really should stop consuming things that he\u2019s allergic to.</p><p>There are people starting to approach him, he can feel it from his perch on his stool at the bar, and he tenses, not wanting to have to talk to anyone tonight. Well, maybe not <i>anyone</i>.</p><p>\u201cPhil! You didn\u2019t tell me you were coming!\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s PJ, and he slaps Phil\u2019s back, smile too wide for his face. Sophie is next to him, giving him a warm smile, and he relaxes a little.</p><p>\u201cYeah, sorry. I wasn\u2019t sure if I was going to or not.\u201d</p><p>Out of everyone Phil used to associate with, PJ was the only person he kept in semi-regular contact with; their friendship expanded past the imaginary walls of the internet.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m glad you came! Did you want to sit at our table for dinner?\u201d</p><p>Phil accepts the offer, relieved he won\u2019t have to sit by himself or with a bunch of the vloggers he wasn\u2019t all that fond of. He takes his place next to PJ and lets him talk, happy to just listen for now.</p><p>\u201cDan!\u201d</p><p>Phil\u2019s head turns so fast, he gets a crick in it and winces in pain.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Dan says, taking a seat at the table, Ron sitting next to him.</p><p>\u201cYou showed! I thought you said you weren\u2019t going to.\u201d</p><p>Dan glances at Phil quickly before replying, but it\u2019s so fast Phil\u2019s not sure if he imagined it or not.</p><p>\u201cWell, I thought it might be worth coming.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s ambiguous and his tone is vague, leaving Phil feeling irritated. If he had something to say, why not just come out and say it? Although, he was often told that he needed to take his own advice.</p><p>Dinner comes and puts a pause on the awkward conversation that PJ, Sophie, and Ron had mostly been keeping up. Phil can feel Dan\u2019s eyes on him far too often, choosing to avert his own gaze. Part of him wants to confront Dan, the other just wants to leave and forget that he had ever thought coming here would be a good idea.</p><p>-</p><p>By the time the empty plates are taken away and the speakers take the stage, Phil\u2019s got a headache throbbing at the back of his head, and his eyes are starting to get droopy thanks to his inappropriate wake up time.</p><p>The speaker is talking about how much Youtube has grown and how happy they are that everyone is attending, and it sounds a lot like white noise to Phil, only serving to make his eyes droop more. The advantage of the room being darkened, though, is that he can watch Dan out of the corner of his eye without it being conspicuous.</p><p>He\u2019s just as beautiful as he was back then, maybe even more so. Everything that had been delicate and understated about Dan is broad and bold now. His hair, the way the constellation of freckles dots across his cheeks. His fingers and hands are bigger now, and Phil can feel a tug in his chest of the thought of smaller, soft hands clasping his own. He drags his eyes away because he really, really doesn\u2019t want to have a breakdown in the middle of this party in front of semi-strangers and <i>especially</i> not in front of Dan.</p><p>He mostly has himself under control, but then there is a slide show playing on the screen onstage and Phil\u2019s breath leaves his lungs in a quick huff. They are showing pictures of everyone throughout the years, and the third picture covering the screen is of them.</p><p>It\u2019s an old one - the two of them with a group of others under a waterfall in Jamaica. Their arms are wrapped around each other, smiles wide across their faces. He\u2019s transported to hot sandy beaches, dazzling blue waters, and crisp white sheets that felt heavenly against their skin while they laid tangled together after sex.</p><p>Everything hits Phil all at once and suddenly the spacious room is stifling. He gets up and leaves abruptly, not bothering to apologize or provide any explanations; he\u2019s afraid of what would leave his mouth if he opened it.</p><p>-</p><p>It\u2019s beginning to rain outside, tiny drops of water splattering on the pavement, but Phil stands outside anyway, leaning against the sleek, modern walls of the building. He\u2019s not sure when he started crying, but there are tears leaving little wet spots on his dress shirt along with the rain.</p><p>The door opens somewhere to the right of him and he doesn\u2019t look up even as a pair of expensive looking boots stop in front of him. He doesn\u2019t have to look up to know that it\u2019s Dan. No other person he\u2019s ever met would like the studded monstrosities that Dan always had a fondness for.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never understood why you liked such ugly shoes,\u201d Phil says, keeping his eyes on the ground.</p><p>\u201cThese are Alexander McQueen\u2019s, Phil, have some respect.\u201d</p><p>He knows that tone, he\u2019s heard it thousands of times: exasperated with a hint of fondness. It does nothing to help him stifle the tears still running down his face.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure they cost more than your rent, right?\u201d He hates the way that the his voice cracks a little, but Dan lets out a little chuckle and he\u2019s more relieved than he has a right to be.</p><p>\u201cYou still shop at Topman, you can\u2019t give me any crap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTopman is great, you\u2019re just a designer snob.\u201d He forces out a little laugh so that Dan knows he\u2019s not trying to be a dick.</p><p>When he finally looks up, he almost wishes he hadn\u2019t. Somehow Dan is even prettier in the rain, something he\u2019s not sure how he never properly realized. He wants to start sobbing, feeling all of the things he\u2019s been trying to bury for the past three years.</p><p>\u201cI live in London now.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s not sure why this is what comes out of his mouth, but he\u2019s pleasantly surprised by Dan\u2019s smile. It\u2019s not a full smile, no dimples, but it\u2019s something.</p><p>\u201cI know. PJ told me.\u201d</p><p>Freaking PJ and his big mouth.</p><p>\u201cI should have told you. And I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t. I\u2019m sorry about a lot of things.\u201d</p><p>The hitch in his breath isn\u2019t loud enough to hear, but Phil is still in tune enough with Dan\u2019s body that he can recognize his reaction by the way his chest expands quickly and his lips purse a little like he\u2019s trying not to cry.</p><p>\u201cYou could have come with me, you know that, right? I didn\u2019t want to go alone, and I didn\u2019t want to leave you, but you were so god damn stubborn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Phil breaths. \u201cI was young and scared and - I don\u2019t even know. I don\u2019t want to give you a bunch of bullshit excuses, you deserve more than that. I just want you to know that I <i>am</i> sorry.\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t think he\u2019s imagining the way that Dan\u2019s eyes are shining in the light from the nearest lamp post.</p><p>\u201cI hated you for a really long time.\u201d</p><p>Phil just nods, not even remotely shocked by this. It\u2019s what he deserves, really.</p><p>\u201cBut I got tired of that. I don\u2019t want to hate you, I love you too much for that.\u201d</p><p>Phil definitely can\u2019t breath now. The words leave a ball of emotion stuck in his throat and he\u2019s rendered speechless.</p><p>\u201cBut what about Ron?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s my friend. My best friend, really.\u201d He doesn\u2019t think he deserves to feel the relief that he does from those words, nor the spike of jealousy he feels at someone else being called Dan\u2019s best friend. \u201cHe was the first person I met in London and he took me under his wing. I\u2019ve spent a lot of time crying on his shoulder about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDan, I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI -\u201d he starts and then has to stop as a shuddering breath leaves him.</p><p>Phil suddenly remembers that they are both still standing in the rain, probably ruining both of their clothes, but he doesn\u2019t care. He doesn\u2019t want to break whatever spell it is that seems to be cast between them. Something is happening here, and Phil won\u2019t risk ruining it.</p><p>\u201cI knew that you wouldn\u2019t want to leave Manchester. I knew when I asked you to move to London that you would say no, and it was my decision to leave. I could have given you more time, I could have tried to compromise, but I didn\u2019t and that is on me. I know that I\u2019ve made you feel like it was all you and it was your fault that things ended, but it\u2019s on me, too.\u201d</p><p>Phil\u2019s not sure what to say back. There are so many words on the tip of his tongue, but none feel right. He wants to say that he should have been braver, should have tried to make things work, even long distance, but those things are only the tip of the iceberg of the things he feels.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to go get a coffee? Maybe talk a little? I have so much to say, and I just don\u2019t know how to. I\u2019ve missed you so much and I haven\u2019t stopped thinking about you, even when I didn\u2019t want to. You\u2019ve been every thought in my brain since you left.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s no reply, only Dan surging forward and capturing Phil\u2019s lips in his own.</p><p>It\u2019s like coming home after a harrowing journey and being engulfed in all the things you love. It\u2019s sweet and soft, demanding and insistent, in the same way that Dan is.</p><p>Phil never wants to stop.</p><p>They do though, because they are still standing in the middle of the pavement late at night in the rain, but Dan pulls back and smiles, grabbing Phil\u2019s hand and leading him away from the event. He\u2019s not sure where they are going, but as long as he\u2019s with Dan, he\u2019s not too bothered about the destination.</p>",

It had started off as a promising day; the barista had gotten his coffee order right, he got on the tube on time, and he had been able to finish all of his work early. But opening the shiny red envelope had turned what would have been a nice, relaxing evening at home into him standing in the middle of his kitchen with years of memories flooding his brain.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t thought about YouTube in years, at least not in the sense of being a creator. He still watched the occasional cat video or a funny late night skit, but being a \u2018YouTuber\u2019 wasn\u2019t his life anymore, something that the invitation did not seem to take to mind.</p><p><i>\u201dJoin us for YouTube\u2019s 10 year celebration!\u201d</i></p>[[MORE]]<p>It gave a time, date, and location that Phil did his best not to commit to memory. He had no desire to go to a building he used to frequent and see people who he used to consider his friends, but ever since he stopped making videos hadn\u2019t bothered to try and keep in touch with him.</p><p>And maybe he hadn\u2019t tried that hard either, but everything that had to do with YouTube made him think of Dan, and that was at the very top of his \u2018things to avoid thinking about\u2019 list.</p><p>Before he can stop it, his mind floods with memories of said person he avoided thinking about. Thoughts of dimples and big coffee-colored eyes. Holidays on the beach and shitty Manchester apartments with a balcony that they spent more time on than they did inside.</p><p>An ache pulls at his chest and he throws the fancy piece of card stock in the bin.</p><p>-</p><p>It\u2019s Cornelia who brings it up the next day when he\u2019s sitting at his desk and trying to mind his own business. She pops her fiery, red head in and sits on the spare chair he keeps tucked in the corner of his tiny office.</p><p>\u201cDid you get that thing from YouTube for their ten year anniversary?\u201d</p><p>Phil pretends to ignore her, focusing extra hard on his computer screen, but he should know that she isn\u2019t going to let him get away with it that easy.</p><p>\u201cPhilip, I\u2019m talking to youuu!\u201d she croons, waving her hand in his face. He loves her dearly, but she\u2019s a lot like Martyn in the most annoying ways.</p><p>\u201cYes, I got the invitation, and no, I\u2019m not going.\u201d</p><p>She pouts and crosses her arms. \u201cWell, why not? Wouldn\u2019t you like to see all your old friends?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s smart and doesn\u2019t say \u2018Dan\u2019 because she knows that will set Phil off. But she still pokes and prods at him until he answers.</p><p>\u201cThey were barely my friends then, and they certainly aren\u2019t now.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s being grumpy and petulant, but the last thing he wants to talk about this right now. He\u2019s got a migraine building, and he just wants to go home and think of things that are decidedly <i>not</i> about his old life and the people who used to be in it.</p><p>\u201cStill, though,\u201d she continues, \u201cit would be fun. Plus, I\u2019m sure you\u2019d get a bunch of cool swag.\u201d</p><p>Phil cringes, his nose scrunching up. \u201cGod, please don\u2019t say \u2018swag,\u2019 it makes you sound like some twelve year old fuckboy.\u201d</p><p>She cringes this time, but her melodic laugh follows.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re such a grump sometimes. I miss when you were fun.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s said as a joke, and logically he knows that, but the comment still stings. He knows that things are different. Knows that he used to be a lot more carefree and lively, but his life is different now.</p><p>He\u2019s different now.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going home. I have a headache. I\u2019ll text Martyn and let him know.\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t wait for her reply, just packs his laptop and some extra work into his backpack and heads outside. The air is cold and has the stench of London that he still isn\u2019t used to, but he doesn\u2019t feel quite as stifled anymore. He gazes up into the dreary sky and feels an ache in his chest that he had mostly been great at ignoring for the past three years.</p><p>-</p><p>Instead of going home like he originally planned, he spots a quaint little coffee shop a few blocks down from work and decides that maybe some caffeine will help his headache.</p><p>It\u2019s quiet inside, thankfully, and he\u2019s able to go straight to the counter and order a too-sweet latte and snag one of the plushy arm chairs in the corner by the window. He sips the scorching beverage slowly and tries to relax. His shoulders and neck feel too tense, and it\u2019s doing nothing to help the dull throb of his head.</p><p>He stares out the window and people watches for bit, always interested in the coming and goings of those around him. He used to like making up stories about all the passerby. But that was a long time ago, when his life was chaotic and full of dimpled smiles and Manchester macchiatos.</p><p>Someone walks by as he\u2019s gazing idly out to the street and it makes his heart stop. He knows exactly who it is, and he hopes beyond hope that they don\u2019t stop into this particular shop. But of course the universe isn\u2019t that kind.</p><p>Dan walks in, taller and more broad than Phil remembers. His hair is curly now, too, and Phil can\u2019t help but wonder if he just didn\u2019t have time to straighten it or if that\u2019s just how he wears it now.</p><p>Dan walks up to the counter, and the shop is so small he can hear what Dan orders and isn\u2019t all that surprised that it\u2019s tea. He always preferred that to coffee, Phil\u2019s brain traitorously supplies. He doesn\u2019t want to remember those tiny little facts about someone that he does everything in his power to avoid.</p><p>As he busies himself with trying to become invisible and melt into the chair he\u2019s in, Dan glances around the shop and his eyes fall on Phil. He doesn\u2019t think he\u2019s imagining the way that his breath hitches and the tug of a frown on his lips.</p><p>He moves Phil\u2019s way once the barista hands him his cup, and instead of doing what Phil prays he will do and walk out the door, he approaches Phil where he\u2019s curled into a ball on the chair.</p><p>\u201cPhil.\u201d</p><p>Phil can\u2019t quite put his finger on what tone Dan uses, but he knows there is at least a tiny hint of surprise and maybe even a touch of anger.</p><p>\u201cUh. Hi.\u201d</p><p>Dan stares back, unimpressed. He\u2019s not entirely sure what Dan expects of him right now, in the middle of a coffee shop in broad daylight. Now is not the time for apologies and declarations of love. He severely just wants to stand up and leave, but he knows his mum would have his hide at being so rude.</p><p>\u201cHow have you been?\u201d It\u2019s a polite platitude that doesn\u2019t encompass half of the questions churning in Phil head. He wants to know everything, every tiny insignificant thing that has happened in the time that\u2019s passed, but he won\u2019t ask. He\u2019s nothing if not stubborn.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t seen you in three years. You haven\u2019t called, texted, <i>anything,</i> and you ask me how I am?\u201d</p><p>If he only listened to the tone of his voice, it might be easy to think that they were having a polite conversation about the weather. But Phil can hear the words, too, and they cut right down to the bone. Yes, everything Dan said was true, but he\u2019s not the only one who did wrong in this situation.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one who left.\u201d It wasn\u2019t what Phil had intended to say, but the words were out before he could stop them.</p><p>Dan retracts like he\u2019s been slapped in the face, and he looks like he\u2019s about to say something cutting when someone who Phil hadn\u2019t even realized was here walks up and slips his arm through Dan\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cHello, love,\u201d the man says to Dan, snapping both of their attention to him.</p><p>Dan whips his head around to look at the newcomer and glances back to Phil. It\u2019s tense for a second before Dan seems to make some sort of internal decision, tightening his elbow around the man\u2019s arm and pulling it closer to his body. It says more than any words could.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d the stranger says, finally glancing at Phil. \u201cI\u2019m Ron.\u201d</p><p>He untangles himself from Dan\u2019s arm and moves forward to shake Phil\u2019s hand. He stares at it for half a second before taking it in his own trembling hand and shaking it.</p><p>\u201cPhil.\u201d</p><p>His bright smile falters a little bit, and a pit opens up in Phil\u2019s stomach.</p><p>\u201cOh. You\u2019re <i>that</i> Phil.\u201d</p><p>His eyes immediately move to Dan, but he looks away before Phil can read into his reaction.</p><p>\u201cUm, I guess?\u201d</p><p>Ron moves back to Dan\u2019s side, a united front against Phil, and his smile is a bit tighter this time.</p><p>\u201cWell, it was lovely to meet you, but we have to be going.\u201d</p><p>He pulls on Dan\u2019s arm and he follows Ron out of the building, but he keeps his eyes on Phil and doesn\u2019t break the eye contact until he\u2019s out the door and heading in the opposite direction of the shop.</p><p>When he gets home, Phil opens the lid to the bin and stares at the invitation still laying on the top innocently, as if it hasn\u2019t been causing Phil stress and worry since it arrived in the mail yesterday. He doesn\u2019t retrieve it, because he has no desire to get bin juice all over himself, but he does take a picture with his phone so he has the place and date, even though he tells himself he isn\u2019t going.</p><p>He can\u2019t pretend he\u2019s not thinking about it, though. Seeing Dan sparked something in him that he hasn\u2019t been able to tamper down since. Yes, he had known they were living in the same city now, but he had hoped that in a city of over eight million people, he would hopefully be able to avoid ever seeing him. He should have known that he couldn\u2019t continue to be so lucky.</p><p>He takes a few tablets and lays down, hoping dreamless sleep comes to him, but when he finally does succumb to his heavy eyelids, it\u2019s doe eyes and dimpled smiles that he dreams of.</p><p>-</p><p>Saturday.</p><p>It\u2019s the day that looms heavy over Phil\u2019s head the rest of the week. He knows the date, time, and place of the \u2018Celebration\u2019 almost as well as he knows his name. Sometime Thursday night is the night he finally gives up the pretense of pretending he didn\u2019t care or that he would possibly go. The temptation of seeing Dan again is too great, although he will never utter those words aloud, even to himself.</p><p>Cornelia doesn\u2019t bring it up again, thankfully. They go about their work, polite if not a bit strained (mostly on Phil\u2019s part), and the rest of the week is perfectly average.</p><p>Except for the fact that he barely sleeps, and when he does, Dan is all that he dreams of. Once upon a time, that was a good thing. Once upon a time, there was no reason for Phil to dread reliving old memories of them together.</p><p>By the time Friday rolls around, he\u2019s a bit of an actual mess and spends the whole night combing through his closet to find something that he can wear, even though he isn\u2019t going to the party. He\u2019s not, he tells himself, even as he leaves the house and runs into Topman to find an outfit that he thinks will do a good job of saying, \u2018Yes, I have a good job and am doing just fine by myself, thank you very much.\u2019</p><p>He barely sleeps at all that night, and when he wakes up on Saturday at nearly 5 am, he gets up and does what he absolutely despises: goes for a run.</p><p>It\u2019s terrible and torturous, but he gets through the whole thing, only having to stop and catch his breath twice. He hadn\u2019t properly gone for a run in years. When he and Dan first split, he ran all the time since it was the only way to get his head out of the cloud of despair and misery it had called home for quite some time.</p><p>He stops by Tesco and grabs some things for breakfast, figuring he might as well make pancakes if he\u2019s going to be awake at this god awful hour. Flour, butter, milk, some chocolate for later, more instant coffee, some fruit - he wonders around the store for entirely longer than necessary, plonking random items into the cart, which he regrets as soon as he remembers he has to carry it all the way home.</p><p>-</p><p>It\u2019s loud in the event center YouTube booked, not even because there are tons of people, just because the people here are all too loud and boisterous. Instead of walking around and socializing, Phil goes straight to the bar and orders a shot. The tequila burns as it runs down his throat, and he is reminded that he really should stop consuming things that he\u2019s allergic to.</p><p>There are people starting to approach him, he can feel it from his perch on his stool at the bar, and he tenses, not wanting to have to talk to anyone tonight. Well, maybe not <i>anyone</i>.</p><p>\u201cPhil! You didn\u2019t tell me you were coming!\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s PJ, and he slaps Phil\u2019s back, smile too wide for his face. Sophie is next to him, giving him a warm smile, and he relaxes a little.</p><p>\u201cYeah, sorry. I wasn\u2019t sure if I was going to or not.\u201d</p><p>Out of everyone Phil used to associate with, PJ was the only person he kept in semi-regular contact with; their friendship expanded past the imaginary walls of the internet.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m glad you came! Did you want to sit at our table for dinner?\u201d</p><p>Phil accepts the offer, relieved he won\u2019t have to sit by himself or with a bunch of the vloggers he wasn\u2019t all that fond of. He takes his place next to PJ and lets him talk, happy to just listen for now.</p><p>\u201cDan!\u201d</p><p>Phil\u2019s head turns so fast, he gets a crick in it and winces in pain.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Dan says, taking a seat at the table, Ron sitting next to him.</p><p>\u201cYou showed! I thought you said you weren\u2019t going to.\u201d</p><p>Dan glances at Phil quickly before replying, but it\u2019s so fast Phil\u2019s not sure if he imagined it or not.</p><p>\u201cWell, I thought it might be worth coming.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s ambiguous and his tone is vague, leaving Phil feeling irritated. If he had something to say, why not just come out and say it? Although, he was often told that he needed to take his own advice.</p><p>Dinner comes and puts a pause on the awkward conversation that PJ, Sophie, and Ron had mostly been keeping up. Phil can feel Dan\u2019s eyes on him far too often, choosing to avert his own gaze. Part of him wants to confront Dan, the other just wants to leave and forget that he had ever thought coming here would be a good idea.</p><p>-</p><p>By the time the empty plates are taken away and the speakers take the stage, Phil\u2019s got a headache throbbing at the back of his head, and his eyes are starting to get droopy thanks to his inappropriate wake up time.</p><p>The speaker is talking about how much Youtube has grown and how happy they are that everyone is attending, and it sounds a lot like white noise to Phil, only serving to make his eyes droop more. The advantage of the room being darkened, though, is that he can watch Dan out of the corner of his eye without it being conspicuous.</p><p>He\u2019s just as beautiful as he was back then, maybe even more so. Everything that had been delicate and understated about Dan is broad and bold now. His hair, the way the constellation of freckles dots across his cheeks. His fingers and hands are bigger now, and Phil can feel a tug in his chest of the thought of smaller, soft hands clasping his own. He drags his eyes away because he really, really doesn\u2019t want to have a breakdown in the middle of this party in front of semi-strangers and <i>especially</i> not in front of Dan.</p><p>He mostly has himself under control, but then there is a slide show playing on the screen onstage and Phil\u2019s breath leaves his lungs in a quick huff. They are showing pictures of everyone throughout the years, and the third picture covering the screen is of them.</p><p>It\u2019s an old one - the two of them with a group of others under a waterfall in Jamaica. Their arms are wrapped around each other, smiles wide across their faces. He\u2019s transported to hot sandy beaches, dazzling blue waters, and crisp white sheets that felt heavenly against their skin while they laid tangled together after sex.</p><p>Everything hits Phil all at once and suddenly the spacious room is stifling. He gets up and leaves abruptly, not bothering to apologize or provide any explanations; he\u2019s afraid of what would leave his mouth if he opened it.</p><p>-</p><p>It\u2019s beginning to rain outside, tiny drops of water splattering on the pavement, but Phil stands outside anyway, leaning against the sleek, modern walls of the building. He\u2019s not sure when he started crying, but there are tears leaving little wet spots on his dress shirt along with the rain.</p><p>The door opens somewhere to the right of him and he doesn\u2019t look up even as a pair of expensive looking boots stop in front of him. He doesn\u2019t have to look up to know that it\u2019s Dan. No other person he\u2019s ever met would like the studded monstrosities that Dan always had a fondness for.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never understood why you liked such ugly shoes,\u201d Phil says, keeping his eyes on the ground.</p><p>\u201cThese are Alexander McQueen\u2019s, Phil, have some respect.\u201d</p><p>He knows that tone, he\u2019s heard it thousands of times: exasperated with a hint of fondness. It does nothing to help him stifle the tears still running down his face.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure they cost more than your rent, right?\u201d He hates the way that the his voice cracks a little, but Dan lets out a little chuckle and he\u2019s more relieved than he has a right to be.</p><p>\u201cYou still shop at Topman, you can\u2019t give me any crap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTopman is great, you\u2019re just a designer snob.\u201d He forces out a little laugh so that Dan knows he\u2019s not trying to be a dick.</p><p>When he finally looks up, he almost wishes he hadn\u2019t. Somehow Dan is even prettier in the rain, something he\u2019s not sure how he never properly realized. He wants to start sobbing, feeling all of the things he\u2019s been trying to bury for the past three years.</p><p>\u201cI live in London now.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s not sure why this is what comes out of his mouth, but he\u2019s pleasantly surprised by Dan\u2019s smile. It\u2019s not a full smile, no dimples, but it\u2019s something.</p><p>\u201cI know. PJ told me.\u201d</p><p>Freaking PJ and his big mouth.</p><p>\u201cI should have told you. And I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t. I\u2019m sorry about a lot of things.\u201d</p><p>The hitch in his breath isn\u2019t loud enough to hear, but Phil is still in tune enough with Dan\u2019s body that he can recognize his reaction by the way his chest expands quickly and his lips purse a little like he\u2019s trying not to cry.</p><p>\u201cYou could have come with me, you know that, right? I didn\u2019t want to go alone, and I didn\u2019t want to leave you, but you were so god damn stubborn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Phil breaths. \u201cI was young and scared and - I don\u2019t even know. I don\u2019t want to give you a bunch of bullshit excuses, you deserve more than that. I just want you to know that I <i>am</i> sorry.\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t think he\u2019s imagining the way that Dan\u2019s eyes are shining in the light from the nearest lamp post.</p><p>\u201cI hated you for a really long time.\u201d</p><p>Phil just nods, not even remotely shocked by this. It\u2019s what he deserves, really.</p><p>\u201cBut I got tired of that. I don\u2019t want to hate you, I love you too much for that.\u201d</p><p>Phil definitely can\u2019t breath now. The words leave a ball of emotion stuck in his throat and he\u2019s rendered speechless.</p><p>\u201cBut what about Ron?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s my friend. My best friend, really.\u201d He doesn\u2019t think he deserves to feel the relief that he does from those words, nor the spike of jealousy he feels at someone else being called Dan\u2019s best friend. \u201cHe was the first person I met in London and he took me under his wing. I\u2019ve spent a lot of time crying on his shoulder about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDan, I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI -\u201d he starts and then has to stop as a shuddering breath leaves him.</p><p>Phil suddenly remembers that they are both still standing in the rain, probably ruining both of their clothes, but he doesn\u2019t care. He doesn\u2019t want to break whatever spell it is that seems to be cast between them. Something is happening here, and Phil won\u2019t risk ruining it.</p><p>\u201cI knew that you wouldn\u2019t want to leave Manchester. I knew when I asked you to move to London that you would say no, and it was my decision to leave. I could have given you more time, I could have tried to compromise, but I didn\u2019t and that is on me. I know that I\u2019ve made you feel like it was all you and it was your fault that things ended, but it\u2019s on me, too.\u201d</p><p>Phil\u2019s not sure what to say back. There are so many words on the tip of his tongue, but none feel right. He wants to say that he should have been braver, should have tried to make things work, even long distance, but those things are only the tip of the iceberg of the things he feels.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to go get a coffee? Maybe talk a little? I have so much to say, and I just don\u2019t know how to. I\u2019ve missed you so much and I haven\u2019t stopped thinking about you, even when I didn\u2019t want to.

It had started off as a promising day; the barista had gotten his coffee order right, he got on the tube on time, and he had been able to finish all of his work early. But opening the shiny red envelope had turned what would have been a nice, relaxing evening at home into him standing in the middle of his kitchen with years of memories flooding his brain.</p><p>He hadn&rsquo;t thought about YouTube in years, at least not in the sense of being a creator. He still watched the occasional cat video or a funny late night skit, but being a &lsquo;YouTuber&rsquo; wasn&rsquo;t his life anymore, something that the invitation did not seem to take to mind.</p><p><i>&rdquo;Join us for YouTube&rsquo;s 10 year celebration!&rdquo;</i></p><p>It gave a time, date, and location that Phil did his best not to commit to memory. He had no desire to go to a building he used to frequent and see people who he used to consider his friends, but ever since he stopped making videos hadn&rsquo;t bothered to try and keep in touch with him.</p><p>And maybe he hadn&rsquo;t tried that hard either, but everything that had to do with YouTube made him think of Dan, and that was at the very top of his &lsquo;things to avoid thinking about&rsquo; list.</p><p>Before he can stop it, his mind floods with memories of said person he avoided thinking about. Thoughts of dimples and big coffee-colored eyes. Holidays on the beach and shitty Manchester apartments with a balcony that they spent more time on than they did inside.</p><p>An ache pulls at his chest and he throws the fancy piece of card stock in the bin.</p><p>-</p><p>It&rsquo;s Cornelia who brings it up the next day when he&rsquo;s sitting at his desk and trying to mind his own business. She pops her fiery, red head in and sits on the spare chair he keeps tucked in the corner of his tiny office.</p><p>&ldquo;Did you get that thing from YouTube for their ten year anniversary?&rdquo;</p><p>Phil pretends to ignore her, focusing extra hard on his computer screen, but he should know that she isn&rsquo;t going to let him get away with it that easy.</p><p>&ldquo;Philip, I&rsquo;m talking to youuu!&rdquo; she croons, waving her hand in his face. He loves her dearly, but she&rsquo;s a lot like Martyn in the most annoying ways.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, I got the invitation, and no, I&rsquo;m not going.&rdquo;</p><p>She pouts and crosses her arms. &ldquo;Well, why not? Wouldn&rsquo;t you like to see all your old friends?&rdquo;</p><p>She&rsquo;s smart and doesn&rsquo;t say &lsquo;Dan&rsquo; because she knows that will set Phil off. But she still pokes and prods at him until he answers.</p><p>&ldquo;They were barely my friends then, and they certainly aren&rsquo;t now.&rdquo;</p><p>He&rsquo;s being grumpy and petulant, but the last thing he wants to talk about this right now. He&rsquo;s got a migraine building, and he just wants to go home and think of things that are decidedly <i>not</i> about his old life and the people who used to be in it.</p><p>&ldquo;Still, though,&rdquo; she continues, &ldquo;it would be fun. Plus, I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;d get a bunch of cool swag.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil cringes, his nose scrunching up. &ldquo;God, please don&rsquo;t say &lsquo;swag,&rsquo; it makes you sound like some twelve year old fuckboy.&rdquo;</p><p>She cringes this time, but her melodic laugh follows.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re such a grump sometimes. I miss when you were fun.&rdquo;</p><p>It&rsquo;s said as a joke, and logically he knows that, but the comment still stings. He knows that things are different. Knows that he used to be a lot more carefree and lively, but his life is different now.</p><p>He&rsquo;s different now.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going home. I have a headache. I&rsquo;ll text Martyn and let him know.&rdquo;</p><p>He doesn&rsquo;t wait for her reply, just packs his laptop and some extra work into his backpack and heads outside. The air is cold and has the stench of London that he still isn&rsquo;t used to, but he doesn&rsquo;t feel quite as stifled anymore. He gazes up into the dreary sky and feels an ache in his chest that he had mostly been great at ignoring for the past three years.</p><p>-</p><p>Instead of going home like he originally planned, he spots a quaint little coffee shop a few blocks down from work and decides that maybe some caffeine will help his headache.</p><p>It&rsquo;s quiet inside, thankfully, and he&rsquo;s able to go straight to the counter and order a too-sweet latte and snag one of the plushy arm chairs in the corner by the window. He sips the scorching beverage slowly and tries to relax. His shoulders and neck feel too tense, and it&rsquo;s doing nothing to help the dull throb of his head.</p><p>He stares out the window and people watches for bit, always interested in the coming and goings of those around him. He used to like making up stories about all the passerby. But that was a long time ago, when his life was chaotic and full of dimpled smiles and Manchester macchiatos.</p><p>Someone walks by as he&rsquo;s gazing idly out to the street and it makes his heart stop. He knows exactly who it is, and he hopes beyond hope that they don&rsquo;t stop into this particular shop. But of course the universe isn&rsquo;t that kind.</p><p>Dan walks in, taller and more broad than Phil remembers. His hair is curly now, too, and Phil can&rsquo;t help but wonder if he just didn&rsquo;t have time to straighten it or if that&rsquo;s just how he wears it now.</p><p>Dan walks up to the counter, and the shop is so small he can hear what Dan orders and isn&rsquo;t all that surprised that it&rsquo;s tea. He always preferred that to coffee, Phil&rsquo;s brain traitorously supplies. He doesn&rsquo;t want to remember those tiny little facts about someone that he does everything in his power to avoid.</p><p>As he busies himself with trying to become invisible and melt into the chair he&rsquo;s in, Dan glances around the shop and his eyes fall on Phil. He doesn&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s imagining the way that his breath hitches and the tug of a frown on his lips.</p><p>He moves Phil&rsquo;s way once the barista hands him his cup, and instead of doing what Phil prays he will do and walk out the door, he approaches Phil where he&rsquo;s curled into a ball on the chair.</p><p>&ldquo;Phil.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil can&rsquo;t quite put his finger on what tone Dan uses, but he knows there is at least a tiny hint of surprise and maybe even a touch of anger.</p><p>&ldquo;Uh. Hi.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan stares back, unimpressed. He&rsquo;s not entirely sure what Dan expects of him right now, in the middle of a coffee shop in broad daylight. Now is not the time for apologies and declarations of love. He severely just wants to stand up and leave, but he knows his mum would have his hide at being so rude.</p><p>&ldquo;How have you been?&rdquo; It&rsquo;s a polite platitude that doesn&rsquo;t encompass half of the questions churning in Phil head. He wants to know everything, every tiny insignificant thing that has happened in the time that&rsquo;s passed, but he won&rsquo;t ask. He&rsquo;s nothing if not stubborn.</p><p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t seen you in three years. You haven&rsquo;t called, texted, <i>anything,</i> and you ask me how I am?&rdquo;</p><p>If he only listened to the tone of his voice, it might be easy to think that they were having a polite conversation about the weather. But Phil can hear the words, too, and they cut right down to the bone. Yes, everything Dan said was true, but he&rsquo;s not the only one who did wrong in this situation.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the one who left.&rdquo; It wasn&rsquo;t what Phil had intended to say, but the words were out before he could stop them.</p><p>Dan retracts like he&rsquo;s been slapped in the face, and he looks like he&rsquo;s about to say something cutting when someone who Phil hadn&rsquo;t even realized was here walks up and slips his arm through Dan&rsquo;s.</p><p>&ldquo;Hello, love,&rdquo; the man says to Dan, snapping both of their attention to him.</p><p>Dan whips his head around to look at the newcomer and glances back to Phil. It&rsquo;s tense for a second before Dan seems to make some sort of internal decision, tightening his elbow around the man&rsquo;s arm and pulling it closer to his body. It says more than any words could.</p><p>&ldquo;Hello,&rdquo; the stranger says, finally glancing at Phil. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Ron.&rdquo;</p><p>He untangles himself from Dan&rsquo;s arm and moves forward to shake Phil&rsquo;s hand. He stares at it for half a second before taking it in his own trembling hand and shaking it.</p><p>&ldquo;Phil.&rdquo;</p><p>His bright smile falters a little bit, and a pit opens up in Phil&rsquo;s stomach.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh. You&rsquo;re <i>that</i> Phil.&rdquo;</p><p>His eyes immediately move to Dan, but he looks away before Phil can read into his reaction.</p><p>&ldquo;Um, I guess?&rdquo;</p><p>Ron moves back to Dan&rsquo;s side, a united front against Phil, and his smile is a bit tighter this time.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, it was lovely to meet you, but we have to be going.&rdquo;</p><p>He pulls on Dan&rsquo;s arm and he follows Ron out of the building, but he keeps his eyes on Phil and doesn&rsquo;t break the eye contact until he&rsquo;s out the door and heading in the opposite direction of the shop.</p><p>When he gets home, Phil opens the lid to the bin and stares at the invitation still laying on the top innocently, as if it hasn&rsquo;t been causing Phil stress and worry since it arrived in the mail yesterday. He doesn&rsquo;t retrieve it, because he has no desire to get bin juice all over himself, but he does take a picture with his phone so he has the place and date, even though he tells himself he isn&rsquo;t going.</p><p>He can&rsquo;t pretend he&rsquo;s not thinking about it, though. Seeing Dan sparked something in him that he hasn&rsquo;t been able to tamper down since. Yes, he had known they were living in the same city now, but he had hoped that in a city of over eight million people, he would hopefully be able to avoid ever seeing him. He should have known that he couldn&rsquo;t continue to be so lucky.</p><p>He takes a few tablets and lays down, hoping dreamless sleep comes to him, but when he finally does succumb to his heavy eyelids, it&rsquo;s doe eyes and dimpled smiles that he dreams of.</p><p>-</p><p>Saturday.</p><p>It&rsquo;s the day that looms heavy over Phil&rsquo;s head the rest of the week. He knows the date, time, and place of the &lsquo;Celebration&rsquo; almost as well as he knows his name. Sometime Thursday night is the night he finally gives up the pretense of pretending he didn&rsquo;t care or that he would possibly go. The temptation of seeing Dan again is too great, although he will never utter those words aloud, even to himself.</p><p>Cornelia doesn&rsquo;t bring it up again, thankfully. They go about their work, polite if not a bit strained (mostly on Phil&rsquo;s part), and the rest of the week is perfectly average.</p><p>Except for the fact that he barely sleeps, and when he does, Dan is all that he dreams of. Once upon a time, that was a good thing. Once upon a time, there was no reason for Phil to dread reliving old memories of them together.</p><p>By the time Friday rolls around, he&rsquo;s a bit of an actual mess and spends the whole night combing through his closet to find something that he can wear, even though he isn&rsquo;t going to the party. He&rsquo;s not, he tells himself, even as he leaves the house and runs into Topman to find an outfit that he thinks will do a good job of saying, &lsquo;Yes, I have a good job and am doing just fine by myself, thank you very much.&rsquo;</p><p>He barely sleeps at all that night, and when he wakes up on Saturday at nearly 5 am, he gets up and does what he absolutely despises: goes for a run.</p><p>It&rsquo;s terrible and torturous, but he gets through the whole thing, only having to stop and catch his breath twice. He hadn&rsquo;t properly gone for a run in years. When he and Dan first split, he ran all the time since it was the only way to get his head out of the cloud of despair and misery it had called home for quite some time.</p><p>He stops by Tesco and grabs some things for breakfast, figuring he might as well make pancakes if he&rsquo;s going to be awake at this god awful hour. Flour, butter, milk, some chocolate for later, more instant coffee, some fruit - he wonders around the store for entirely longer than necessary, plonking random items into the cart, which he regrets as soon as he remembers he has to carry it all the way home.</p><p>-</p><p>It&rsquo;s loud in the event center YouTube booked, not even because there are tons of people, just because the people here are all too loud and boisterous. Instead of walking around and socializing, Phil goes straight to the bar and orders a shot. The tequila burns as it runs down his throat, and he is reminded that he really should stop consuming things that he&rsquo;s allergic to.</p><p>There are people starting to approach him, he can feel it from his perch on his stool at the bar, and he tenses, not wanting to have to talk to anyone tonight. Well, maybe not <i>anyone</i>.</p><p>&ldquo;Phil! You didn&rsquo;t tell me you were coming!&rdquo;</p><p>It&rsquo;s PJ, and he slaps Phil&rsquo;s back, smile too wide for his face. Sophie is next to him, giving him a warm smile, and he relaxes a little.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, sorry. I wasn&rsquo;t sure if I was going to or not.&rdquo;</p><p>Out of everyone Phil used to associate with, PJ was the only person he kept in semi-regular contact with; their friendship expanded past the imaginary walls of the internet.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m glad you came! Did you want to sit at our table for dinner?&rdquo;</p><p>Phil accepts the offer, relieved he won&rsquo;t have to sit by himself or with a bunch of the vloggers he wasn&rsquo;t all that fond of. He takes his place next to PJ and lets him talk, happy to just listen for now.</p><p>&ldquo;Dan!&rdquo;</p><p>Phil&rsquo;s head turns so fast, he gets a crick in it and winces in pain.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey,&rdquo; Dan says, taking a seat at the table, Ron sitting next to him.</p><p>&ldquo;You showed! I thought you said you weren&rsquo;t going to.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan glances at Phil quickly before replying, but it&rsquo;s so fast Phil&rsquo;s not sure if he imagined it or not.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I thought it might be worth coming.&rdquo;</p><p>It&rsquo;s ambiguous and his tone is vague, leaving Phil feeling irritated. If he had something to say, why not just come out and say it? Although, he was often told that he needed to take his own advice.</p><p>Dinner comes and puts a pause on the awkward conversation that PJ, Sophie, and Ron had mostly been keeping up. Phil can feel Dan&rsquo;s eyes on him far too often, choosing to avert his own gaze. Part of him wants to confront Dan, the other just wants to leave and forget that he had ever thought coming here would be a good idea.</p><p>-</p><p>By the time the empty plates are taken away and the speakers take the stage, Phil&rsquo;s got a headache throbbing at the back of his head, and his eyes are starting to get droopy thanks to his inappropriate wake up time.</p><p>The speaker is talking about how much Youtube has grown and how happy they are that everyone is attending, and it sounds a lot like white noise to Phil, only serving to make his eyes droop more. The advantage of the room being darkened, though, is that he can watch Dan out of the corner of his eye without it being conspicuous.</p><p>He&rsquo;s just as beautiful as he was back then, maybe even more so. Everything that had been delicate and understated about Dan is broad and bold now. His hair, the way the constellation of freckles dots across his cheeks. His fingers and hands are bigger now, and Phil can feel a tug in his chest of the thought of smaller, soft hands clasping his own. He drags his eyes away because he really, really doesn&rsquo;t want to have a breakdown in the middle of this party in front of semi-strangers and <i>especially</i> not in front of Dan.</p><p>He mostly has himself under control, but then there is a slide show playing on the screen onstage and Phil&rsquo;s breath leaves his lungs in a quick huff. They are showing pictures of everyone throughout the years, and the third picture covering the screen is of them.</p><p>It&rsquo;s an old one - the two of them with a group of others under a waterfall in Jamaica. Their arms are wrapped around each other, smiles wide across their faces. He&rsquo;s transported to hot sandy beaches, dazzling blue waters, and crisp white sheets that felt heavenly against their skin while they laid tangled together after sex.</p><p>Everything hits Phil all at once and suddenly the spacious room is stifling. He gets up and leaves abruptly, not bothering to apologize or provide any explanations; he&rsquo;s afraid of what would leave his mouth if he opened it.</p><p>-</p><p>It&rsquo;s beginning to rain outside, tiny drops of water splattering on the pavement, but Phil stands outside anyway, leaning against the sleek, modern walls of the building. He&rsquo;s not sure when he started crying, but there are tears leaving little wet spots on his dress shirt along with the rain.</p><p>The door opens somewhere to the right of him and he doesn&rsquo;t look up even as a pair of expensive looking boots stop in front of him. He doesn&rsquo;t have to look up to know that it&rsquo;s Dan. No other person he&rsquo;s ever met would like the studded monstrosities that Dan always had a fondness for.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never understood why you liked such ugly shoes,&rdquo; Phil says, keeping his eyes on the ground.</p><p>&ldquo;These are Alexander McQueen&rsquo;s, Phil, have some respect.&rdquo;</p><p>He knows that tone, he&rsquo;s heard it thousands of times: exasperated with a hint of fondness. It does nothing to help him stifle the tears still running down his face.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure they cost more than your rent, right?&rdquo; He hates the way that the his voice cracks a little, but Dan lets out a little chuckle and he&rsquo;s more relieved than he has a right to be.</p><p>&ldquo;You still shop at Topman, you can&rsquo;t give me any crap.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Topman is great, you&rsquo;re just a designer snob.&rdquo; He forces out a little laugh so that Dan knows he&rsquo;s not trying to be a dick.</p><p>When he finally looks up, he almost wishes he hadn&rsquo;t. Somehow Dan is even prettier in the rain, something he&rsquo;s not sure how he never properly realized. He wants to start sobbing, feeling all of the things he&rsquo;s been trying to bury for the past three years.</p><p>&ldquo;I live in London now.&rdquo;</p><p>He&rsquo;s not sure why this is what comes out of his mouth, but he&rsquo;s pleasantly surprised by Dan&rsquo;s smile. It&rsquo;s not a full smile, no dimples, but it&rsquo;s something.</p><p>&ldquo;I know. PJ told me.&rdquo;</p><p>Freaking PJ and his big mouth.</p><p>&ldquo;I should have told you. And I&rsquo;m sorry I didn&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;m sorry about a lot of things.&rdquo;</p><p>The hitch in his breath isn&rsquo;t loud enough to hear, but Phil is still in tune enough with Dan&rsquo;s body that he can recognize his reaction by the way his chest expands quickly and his lips purse a little like he&rsquo;s trying not to cry.</p><p>&ldquo;You could have come with me, you know that, right? I didn&rsquo;t want to go alone, and I didn&rsquo;t want to leave you, but you were so god damn stubborn.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; Phil breaths. &ldquo;I was young and scared and - I don&rsquo;t even know. I don&rsquo;t want to give you a bunch of bullshit excuses, you deserve more than that. I just want you to know that I <i>am</i> sorry.&rdquo;</p><p>He doesn&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s imagining the way that Dan&rsquo;s eyes are shining in the light from the nearest lamp post.</p><p>&ldquo;I hated you for a really long time.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil just nods, not even remotely shocked by this. It&rsquo;s what he deserves, really.</p><p>&ldquo;But I got tired of that. I don&rsquo;t want to hate you, I love you too much for that.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil definitely can&rsquo;t breath now. The words leave a ball of emotion stuck in his throat and he&rsquo;s rendered speechless.</p><p>&ldquo;But what about Ron?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s my friend. My best friend, really.&rdquo; He doesn&rsquo;t think he deserves to feel the relief that he does from those words, nor the spike of jealousy he feels at someone else being called Dan&rsquo;s best friend. &ldquo;He was the first person I met in London and he took me under his wing. I&rsquo;ve spent a lot of time crying on his shoulder about you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Dan, I&rsquo;m so sorry.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I -&rdquo; he starts and then has to stop as a shuddering breath leaves him.</p><p>Phil suddenly remembers that they are both still standing in the rain, probably ruining both of their clothes, but he doesn&rsquo;t care. He doesn&rsquo;t want to break whatever spell it is that seems to be cast between them. Something is happening here, and Phil won&rsquo;t risk ruining it.</p><p>&ldquo;I knew that you wouldn&rsquo;t want to leave Manchester. I knew when I asked you to move to London that you would say no, and it was my decision to leave. I could have given you more time, I could have tried to compromise, but I didn&rsquo;t and that is on me. I know that I&rsquo;ve made you feel like it was all you and it was your fault that things ended, but it&rsquo;s on me, too.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil&rsquo;s not sure what to say back. There are so many words on the tip of his tongue, but none feel right. He wants to say that he should have been braver, should have tried to make things work, even long distance, but those things are only the tip of the iceberg of the things he feels.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you want to go get a coffee? Maybe talk a little? I have so much to say, and I just don&rsquo;t know how to. I&rsquo;ve missed you so much and I haven&rsquo;t stopped thinking about you, even when I didn&rsquo;t want to. You&rsquo;ve been every thought in my brain since you left.&rdquo;</p><p>There&rsquo;s no reply, only Dan surging forward and capturing Phil&rsquo;s lips in his own.</p><p>It&rsquo;s like coming home after a harrowing journey and being engulfed in all the things you love. It&rsquo;s sweet and soft, demanding and insistent, in the same way that Dan is.</p><p>Phil never wants to stop.</p><p>They do though, because they are still standing in the middle of the pavement late at night in the rain, but Dan pulls back and smiles, grabbing Phil&rsquo;s hand and leading him away from the event. He&rsquo;s not sure where they are going, but as long as he&rsquo;s with Dan, he&rsquo;s not too bothered about the destination.</p>",
