Nurses and other doctors looked at her, confused and concerned for her patient, as she ran through the halls, strands of hair falling out of her tightly arranged bun.</p><p><br/><i><b>\u201cDan,\u201d </b></i>she sighed, seeing said boy collapsed on the floor, mumbling words to himself. Stepping closer, she deciphered the sobbed mumble as a cry for \u2018daddy\u2019. <b><i>\u201cJulia, get someone to call Philip Lester, he needs to get here now,\u201d </i></b>she ordered, crouching in front of Dan.</p><p><i><b>\u201cBut visitation-\u201d</b></i></p><p><i><b>\u201cFuck the bloody visitation hours!\u201d</b></i> she shouted, causing Dan to whimper. <i><b>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d </b></i>she whispered to him before turning back to the other psychologist in the room. <b><i>\u201cSeriously, this is only going to get worse if he doesn\u2019t get here soon.\u201d </i></b>Julia nodded, realizing Lela knew the situation a lot better than she did.</p><p><b><i>\u201cEveryone else, back to your rooms!\u201d </i></b>she yelled, voice clear above all the panicking and talking.</p><p style='outline-style: initial; font-style: normal; font-size: 15.12px; font-family: \"Lucida Grande\", \"Lucida Sans Unicode\", \"GNU Unifont\", Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif; list-style: none; margin: 1.286em auto; line-height: 1.5; color: rgb(42, 42, 42); font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);'>Everyone fled from the room, wanting to get away from the crying boy. Eric and Kate remained though, and when Lela said they needed to leave, they blatantly refused. Eric explained that they were his friends and may be of some help until Phil arrived.</p><p>Lela simply nodded, turning back to Dan so she could try to catch his eyes to get his attention.<b><i> \u201cDanny, your daddy\u2019s on his way, okay? He\u2019ll be here soon,\u201d</i></b> she murmured quietly, the room no longer filled with shouts of confusion.</p><p><b><i>\u201cI want daddy, why isn\u2019t daddy here? Does he not love me anymore? He said I was good, it hurt but he told me I was good.

He looked at her, eyes wide and filled with a sort of hope.</p><p><b><i>\u201cIs daddy he-\u201d </i></b>he started to ask, stopping as his eyes landed on the nurse standing warily by the door, awaiting orders.<b><i> \u201cSir,\u201d</i></b> he sobbed. <i><b>\u201cNo, no please no more.

Lela responded by placing her arms around him tightly. Eric had run from the room at some point without her noticing, but she didn\u2019t care. Kate watched on with worried eyes.</p><p><b><i>\u201cCan I?\u201d</i></b> she asked, reaching out towards him, but not touching.

She calmed him down as best she could, ignoring Dan referring to her as his mummy. Once Dan was calm, she took him to the canteen for dinner and left him with Eric and Kate.</p><p>Walking back into her office, she dialed the number of the police station. She didn\u2019t believe Phil could ever hurt Dan on purpose, but she had policies to follow and from what she\u2019d just seen, Dan clearly expected Phil to hurt him. She explained the situation, giving the police the address of the hotel he was staying at and telling them to call her back and let her know what happens.</p>",

She didn\u2019t believe Phil could ever hurt Dan on purpose, but she had policies to follow and from what she\u2019d just seen, Dan clearly expected Phil to hurt him. She explained the situation, giving the police the address of the hotel he was staying at and telling them to call her back and let her know what happens.</p>",

Eric and Kate remained though, and when Lela said they needed to leave, they blatantly refused. Eric explained that they were his friends and may be of some help until Phil arrived.</p><p>Lela simply nodded, turning back to Dan so she could try to catch his eyes to get his attention.<b><i> \u201cDanny, your daddy\u2019s on his way, okay? He\u2019ll be here soon,\u201d</i></b> she murmured quietly, the room no longer filled with shouts of confusion.</p><p><b><i>\u201cI want daddy, why isn\u2019t daddy here?

Kate watched on with worried eyes.</p><p><b><i>\u201cCan I?\u201d</i></b> she asked, reaching out towards him, but not touching.

Is there someone I can get to stay with you and look after you?\u201d</i></b> Phil explained, conscious of Lela\u2019s warning.</p><p><b><i>\u201cBut- But you promised not to leave me!\u201d </i></b>Dan cried.</p><p><b><i>\u201cI\u2019m not, I\u2019ll come back.

Knocking, Phil swung open the door after hearing \u2018come in\u2019 from the other side.</p><p><b><i>\u201cHello Lela, how are you?\u201d </i></b>Phil asked politely.</p><p><i><b>\u201cAlright, how are you and Dan?\u201d </b></i>she returned, eyes trailing to the grown man with a paci between his lips and a teddy bear in his arm.</p><p><b><i>\u201cI\u2019m alright, I\u2019ve got to get going though.

Nurses and other doctors looked at her, confused and concerned for her patient, as she ran through the halls, strands of hair falling out of her tightly arranged bun.</p><p><br /><i><b>&ldquo;Dan,&rdquo; </b></i>she sighed, seeing said boy collapsed on the floor, mumbling words to himself. Stepping closer, she deciphered the sobbed mumble as a cry for &lsquo;daddy&rsquo;. <b><i>&ldquo;Julia, get someone to call Philip Lester, he needs to get here now,&rdquo; </i></b>she ordered, crouching in front of Dan.</p><p><i><b>&ldquo;But visitation-&rdquo;</b></i></p><p><i><b>&ldquo;Fuck the bloody visitation hours!&rdquo;</b></i> she shouted, causing Dan to whimper. <i><b>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; </b></i>she whispered to him before turning back to the other psychologist in the room. <b><i>&ldquo;Seriously, this is only going to get worse if he doesn&rsquo;t get here soon.&rdquo; </i></b>Julia nodded, realizing Lela knew the situation a lot better than she did.</p><p><b><i>&ldquo;Everyone else, back to your rooms!&rdquo; </i></b>she yelled, voice clear above all the panicking and talking.</p><p>Everyone fled from the room, wanting to get away from the crying boy. Eric and Kate remained though, and when Lela said they needed to leave, they blatantly refused. Eric explained that they were his friends and may be of some help until Phil arrived.</p><p>Lela simply nodded, turning back to Dan so she could try to catch his eyes to get his attention.<b><i> &ldquo;Danny, your daddy&rsquo;s on his way, okay? He&rsquo;ll be here soon,&rdquo;</i></b> she murmured quietly, the room no longer filled with shouts of confusion.</p><p><b><i>&ldquo;I want daddy, why isn&rsquo;t daddy here? Does he not love me anymore? He said I was good, it hurt but he told me I was good. Why he leave me?!&rdquo;</i></b> Dan cried, eyes wide as they looked around the room, searching for his daddy.</p><p><b><i>&ldquo;No, of course, he loves you, sweetie. He&rsquo;s on his way right now. He&rsquo;s coming love, okay?&rdquo;</i></b></p><p>A nurse ran into the room panting.<i><b> &ldquo;Phil&rsquo;s on his way, but he won&rsquo;t be here for a good twenty-thirty minute. What should we do? It&rsquo;s your call,&rdquo;</b></i> he said.</p><p><i><b>&ldquo;Danny?&rdquo;</b></i> she called. If he was responsive, she&rsquo;d be able to convince them not to sedate him. He looked at her, eyes wide and filled with a sort of hope.</p><p><b><i>&ldquo;Is daddy he-&rdquo; </i></b>he started to ask, stopping as his eyes landed on the nurse standing warily by the door, awaiting orders.<b><i> &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo;</i></b> he sobbed. <i><b>&ldquo;No, no please no more. Hurts, Le-la, h- help, S- sir&rsquo;s b- b- back. D- Don&rsquo;t let h- him h-urt dad-dy,&rdquo; </b></i>he begged, crawling to hide behind Lela.</p><p><i><b>&ldquo;Get out now!&rdquo; </b></i>she shouted at the nurse who looked guilty before quickly rushing from the room.</p><p><b><i>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s ok Danny. He&rsquo;s gone. He won&rsquo;t hurt you or your daddy, okay? I promise I&rsquo;ll keep you safe until your daddy gets here.&rdquo;</i></b> Dan jumped on her, wrapping his arms tight around her neck and pushing his head into her upper chest, just under her chin. Lela responded by placing her arms around him tightly. Eric had run from the room at some point without her noticing, but she didn&rsquo;t care. Kate watched on with worried eyes.</p><p><b><i>&ldquo;Can I?&rdquo;</i></b> she asked, reaching out towards him, but not touching. Lela contemplated the possible outcomes for a quick second before nodding. She watched as Kate placed her hand on Dan&rsquo;s back, rubbing up and down. <b><i>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay, Danny. Eric&rsquo;s gone to get pooh-bear, do you want to see him?&rdquo;</i></b> she asked.&nbsp;So that&rsquo;s where Eric had gone,&nbsp;Lela thought.</p><p><i><b>&ldquo;Them!&rdquo;</b></i> he shout-sobbed. Kate and Lela were both confused but didn&rsquo;t question it.</p><p><b><i>&ldquo;Do you want to see&hellip; them?&rdquo; </i></b>she asked again.</p><p><b><i>&ldquo;Daddy says pooh-bear will protect me when daddy can&rsquo;t,&rdquo;</i></b> he explained through tears.</p><p>Eric ran in seconds later, waving around the stuffed toy and smiling.</p><p><i><b>&ldquo;No! Stop!&rdquo;</b></i> Dan screeched, pulling from Lela&rsquo;s grip and running to Eric, grabbing pooh-bear and cradling them close to his chest. <i><b>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got you little bear,&rdquo; </b></i>Dan mumbled, quoting what Phil had said to him multiple times while he was crying. <i><b>&ldquo;How could you?!&rdquo; </b></i>Dan suddenly shouted, sounding more like big Dan than little.</p><p>Lela watched from her seat on the ground as Dan gently placed the teddy in one of the beanbags before jumping on Eric. At first, she thought he&rsquo;d hug him like he&rsquo;d done to her but a screech from Eric told her that was not the case. Kate and she both ran forward, pulling Dan off the now-bleeding boy. Once, Lela, had him restrained, Kate helped Eric out of the room, Dan kicking and screaming and crying for his daddy all the while.</p><p>Once Eric had left the room, she let him go, only for him to immediately run to his teddy, crouching in front of it and apologizing, saying he was a bad little for his daddy. Lela watched, not really knowing what to do. He was sedated for the most part, just sitting on the floor, crying with his teddy in his arms and a thumb in between his lips.</p><p>She walked over, kneeling beside him, but not touching. His eyes were closed and he seemed quite blissful&mdash;as if he didn&rsquo;t just attack his friend and roommate. Eventually, the boy collapsed to the side, landing on the beanbag. Lela realized quickly that he&rsquo;d fallen asleep, likely having tired himself out with all the crying.</p><p>~~~~~~~~~~</p><p>When Dan woke up, he felt himself nestled in someone else&rsquo;s arms. He quickly realized it was his daddy as he breathed in his sent. Curling into Phil, he mumbled a quiet &ldquo;daddy&rdquo; as he put his thumb back into his mouth.</p><p><b><i>&ldquo;Hi Danny. Hands are dirty, remember?&rdquo;</i></b> Phil said, pulling Dan&rsquo;s hand from his mouth and pushing a paci into its place.</p><p><i><b>&ldquo;Daddy, did I do bad?&rdquo; </b></i>he asked near silently, eyes downcast to avoid Phil&rsquo;s eyes. His daddy wasn&rsquo;t having it though as he hooked a finger under Dan&rsquo;s chin and tilted his head towards him.</p><p><i><b>&ldquo;No, Danny. You were scared and didn&rsquo;t know what you were doing.&rdquo;</b></i></p><p><i><b>&ldquo;I love you, Daddy.&rdquo;</b></i></p><p><b><i>&ldquo;I love you too, baby boy. Now go back to sleep, I&rsquo;ll be here when you wake up.&rdquo;</i></b></p><p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p><p>When Dan blinked his eyes open, he was still in his daddy&rsquo;s arms. Phil cuddled him close, never loosening his grip even once Dan was sound asleep.</p><p><i><b>&ldquo;Morning Daddy,&rdquo;</b></i> Dan mumbled, snuggling further into Phil&rsquo;s embrace.</p><p>&ldquo;Hi love. It&rsquo;s evening, actually. You had a really long nap, but I didn&rsquo;t want to disturb you.&rdquo;</p><p><i><b>&ldquo;Thank you Daddy. Is it time for dinnies?&rdquo; </b></i>he asked, skooching to slide off Phil&rsquo;s lap.</p><p><b><i>&ldquo;In about ten minutes. Listen little love, I can&rsquo;t stay much longer.
