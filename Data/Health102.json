        "body": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Hey guys, it&rsquo;s been awhile! Hope you are all having a wonderful Chinese new year for those who celebrate. As usual, I&rsquo;ve collected a few interesting studies and wrote short summaries of them for all of you to read. All for educational purposes and to spark some discussion. The paper on sleep is not entirely related to fitness but it is health-related and I thought it would be interesting nonetheless.</p> <p>The first study we will look at is a review written by Schoenfeld &amp; Aragon (2018) and it asks the question: how much protein can muscles use for growth in one meal? This is actually a common question thrown around in the fitness world as a lot of people want to be as efficient as possible and want to maximize protein\u2019s effects on muscle growth in each meal. However, as odd as it sounds, sometimes the question is asked incorrectly. For the question above, some people will ask how much protein can be absorbed in one meal as opposed to how much can be used for muscle growth maximally. All protein will be absorbed but the real question is what happens to all of it afterwards.</p> <p>The review highlights the study conducted by Areta et al. (2013) which is commonly cited to say that 20\u201325 grams of protein is the maximum number that muscles can use for hypertrophy (muscular growth). In this study, trained individuals were given different amounts of protein in a 12 hour period post-workout. Some were supplemented with 10 grams every 1.5 hours, some 20 grams every 3 hours and some 40 grams every 6 hours. In this experiment, the group that consumed 20 grams had the greatest rates of muscle protein synthesis (a fancy term to describe the building of muscles with protein). This would suggest that eating around 20 grams of protein at a time would be the best for building muscle. The biggest limitation that this review noted in the aforementioned study was that the total protein amounts used over the 12 hour period were quite low practically. Individuals training for hypertrophy would be consuming much greater amounts of protein overall.</p> <p>To challenge the previous study, the review presents a paper done by Macnaughton et al. (2016) in which 40 grams of protein elicited greater muscle protein synthesis than 20 grams in the context of full body training. Another experiment carried out by Kim et al. (2016) found that 70g of beef protein showed a more significant anabolic response than 40g of beef protein. However, it should be noted that this response was measured as a whole body response and not just for muscle protein synthesis. Therefore, it is impossible to say which amount is better for muscle protein synthesis in the context of this study.</p> <p>For women, Arnal et al. (1999, 2000) found that one meal with a large amount of protein was better than the same amount spread across several meals in regards to muscle retention. These results are interesting but a limitation to extrapolation is that no resistance training was taking place amongst the subjects.</p> <p>Muscle retention is also similar between those who follow intermittent fasting and those who diet continuously (Seimon et al., 2015). This would suggest that daily protein taken all at once would have the same effects on muscle as spreading out your protein intake across the day.</p> <p>In the end, the authors of this review recommend 0.4\u20130.55 g/kg/meal which follows daily recommended intakes stated in a meta-analysis produced by Morton et al. (2017).</p> <p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> It still is not clear what the optimum number of grams of protein per meal for maximizing muscular growth is but 0.4\u20130.55 g/kg/meal appears to be a safe recommendation based on the current literature.</p> <p>\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014</p> <p>We will now eat into a study done by Lee et al. (2018) in which differences between the conventional deadlift and the Romanian deadlift were investigated. For those who do not know what a Romanian deadlift is, it is essentially a normal deadlift starting from the top (barbell at waist) and then descending the barbell down until the hamstrings cannot stretch any further while not flexing at the lumbar spine. The knees cannot bend further than roughly 15 degrees. It may sound like a stiff-legged deadlift, however, in a stiff legged deadlift, you generally start from the bottom and your knees are allowed to bend more allowing you to bring the barbell to the floor. If you are referring to the straight-legged deadlift, the knees would not flex at all and the barbell would not drag along the legs in the descent.</p> <p>The study recruited 21 males with at least 3 years of both conventional and Romanian deadlift experience with their training occurring at least twice a week. The first day involved 1 repetition maximum testing as this would facilitate selecting the appropriate load for the participants during the trial (subjects would be doing 5 reps of each lift at 70% of their 1 repetition maximum). To examine muscle activation, the scientists used electromyography. To put it simply, this is where electrodes are pasted over certain muscles to measure the electrical activity from the muscles.</p> <p>The conventional deadlift showed more activation in the rectus femoris (a quadricep muscle, one that helps extend your knee and flex your hip) and slightly more activation in the gluteus maximus (your butt). Activation of the biceps femoris (a hamstring muscle) was similar between the two lifts which is interesting considering that many believe that the Romanian deadlift helps target the hamstrings better compared to the conventional deadlift.</p> <p>Torque (force produced about a joint) was much higher in the knee for the conventional deadlift which was probably expected considering the knee goes through a much larger range of motion. Similarly, the torque measured at the ankles were also higher in the conventional deadlifts which may suggest higher calf muscle activity though this was not measured in the study.</p> <p>Some important design aspects to note that affect generalizability is that we may see different results with different loads/intensities. Another issue regarding intensity is that the loads were selected according to the 1 repetition maximum of the subject\u2019s Romanian deadlift. Therefore, the conventional deadlift loads may not truly be 70% of their conventional deadlift 1 repetition maximum. It is safe to say that the intensities in this study were likely not matched. Finally, the hamstrings consist of several muscles but only one hamstring muscle was observed during the experiment.</p> <p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> The conventional deadlift may be better at targetting the quadriceps and the gluteal muscles. Against what is commonly thought, the Romanian deadlift may not be better than the conventional deadlift at hitting the hamstrings, however, more comprehensive electromyography analysis should be done before making a solid statement.</p> <p>\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014</p> <p>A large study conducted by Wild et al. (2018) explored the effects of duration of sleep on cognition. The team created a questionnaire which tested various human cognitive aspects like short-term memory, reasoning, spatial working and planning. However, the main areas that were being observed were short term memory, reasoning and verbal ability. At the same time, questions about sleep were asked to see the relationship between the person\u2019s sleep and their cognitive ability. The questionnaire was set up as an online survey in which they were able to gather 10,886 subjects.</p> <p>Firstly, it appears that as a person ages, their sleep duration decreases.</p> <p>All areas of cognition were affected by sleep duration except for short term memory. This is likely because short term memory is a low-order cognitive process, it is not as complex as something like problem solving. Looking at the graphs below, we can clearly see an inverted-U for almost all cognitive areas which tells us that both too little and too much sleep has negative effects on cognition. Even when the authors thinned the analyzed subjects by removing extremes from both ends of the results, they still saw the inverted-U.</p> <p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/NFHXzuV\" target=\"_blank\">https://imgur.com/NFHXzuV</a></p> <p>The most optimal sleep duration for overall cognitive ability according to these results is 7.38 hours. Any duration over 8 hours likely has a negative effect on cognition and the authors were able to reliably find negative effects below 6.26 hours of sleep. It was also highlighted that even a single night of sleep had effects on cognition the next day. People who are chronically poor sleepers can benefit from just a single night of good quality sleep and the same vice-versa (good sleepers are affected by one bad night). Sleeping less than usual or sleeping 2.76 hours more than usual on one night showed negative effects for cognition on average.</p> <p>Despite sleep duration decreasing with age, the results showed that age has no effect on the relationship between sleep duration and cognitive ability. An interesting fact illustrated by this study is that if one were to sleep less than four hours in a night, you would experience a cognitive impairment that is the same as adding 8 years to your age (cognitive ability worsens with age).</p> <p>Clear limitations of this study include the cross-sectional nature of the study (we are only looking at a snapshot of these people\u2019s lives, long term effects of sleep duration are not seen), the lack of people over 70 years old as well as children / adolescents and the fact that all these results were self-reported. Regarding the last point, the authors explain that the self-reporting still has moderate correlation with objective data.</p> <p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Getting 7 hours of sleep appears to be optimal for cognition. Sleeping any less or more shows some cognitive deficit. Even a one night\u2019s sleep can show acute effects on cognition.</p> <p>\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014</p> <p>The next study is a new meta-analysis done by Grgic et al. (2019) seeing whether or not the time of the day you do your training has an effect on muscle growth or strength. A meta analysis is where you pool the results of several studies together and is generally seen as the greatest form of scientific evidence. Previous research appears to be equivocal in regards to the effects of training time and muscle strength/growth with some studies showing a more positive effect in evening training and some presenting no difference at all between times.</p> <p>In total, the authors collected 11 studies for analysis. At baseline, people were stronger in the evening which suggests that people are naturally stronger in the evening. The authors postulate that this could be due to increased body temperatures in the evening or perhaps some hormonal reason. People who trained in the morning had no difference between strength tests in the morning or evening. However, those who trained the evening were stronger than they were in the morning. This introduces a benefit to morning training as it will make you stronger throughout the entire day in contrast to evening training which would only make you stronger in the evening. In terms of muscle hypertrophy, no differences were found at all.</p> <p>Unfortunately, all of these studies used maximal voluntary contractions to measure strength instead of 1 repetition maximum tests. 1 repetition maximum tests are more practical because they test the strength of movements that you actually train in the gym. There are also not many studies looking at time of training and muscle hypertrophy thus presenting a gap in the literature. Finally, the studies were quite heterogeneous in terms of participants\u2019 ages.</p> <p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> People seem to be stronger in the evening at baseline, however, unlike evening training, morning training will make you stronger throughout the entire day. Any conclusions regarding muscle growth is difficult to make due to the paucity of research on the subject though for now there appears to be no relationship.</p> <p>\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014</p> <p>The last paper we will look at was written by Gon\u00e7alves et al. (2017). Caffeine is a stimulant that is often consumed prior to training to boost muscular strength and endurance. Its effects are well documented and the research strongly supports caffeine as a valuable ergogenic aid (Grgic et al., 2018). The paper at hand investigated the effects of habitual caffeine intake on its efficacy during training. In other words, they ask if one were to consume caffeine regularly, would they build a tolerance to it and experience less of its benefits in training?</p> <p>The most likely theory for the way caffeine works is that it binds to adenosine receptors in the body. Amongst many functions, adenosine can make one feel sleepy and even bring down the heart rate of the body. Now, the worries that caffeine may have a reduced effect with habitual intake stem from the process where caffeine use will cause the body to create more adenosine receptors which allows more adenosine to bind to its receptors.</p> <p>The scientists recruited 40 male, trained cyclists to take part in the experiment. The study was designed in a crossover manner and in a double-blinded fashion. A crossover study means that all the participants got to try all treatments. In this case, every subject was supplemented with 6 mg/kg of caffeine for a week, was given a placebo for another week and was given nothing for another week. A double blind simply means that neither the scientists nor the subjects knew which treatment was being administered which helps reduce bias.</p> <p>The cyclists were grouped according to their caffeine intake prior to being recruited into the study. The low intake group consumed 58 mg/day on average, the moderate intake group at 143 mg/day and the high intake group at 351 mg/day. To put these numbers into perspective, the high intake group is worth about 4.5 250ml cans of Red Bull in terms of caffeine.</p> <p>The first day involved some simple body measurements as well as some testing to determine how much the cyclists needed to perform during real testing later on. The next couple of days consisted of familiarization with the time trial tests that the cyclists would have to do. The time trial basically required each cyclist to cycle a certain amount and then the time to completion would be measured. Caffeine 24 hours before the time trial was restricted and a 24 hour dietary recall before each test was also implemented to control caffeine intake. Subjects fasted 6 hours before each time trial and if they were being supplemented with 6 mg/kg of caffeine, it was done 1 hour before the time trial. Rate of perceived exertion was also measured throughout the trial.</p> <p>Cyclists performed 2\u20133% better when on caffeine compared to placebo/control. There was no difference between placebo and control. Rate of perceived exertion was similar between all treatments.</p> <p>The same trends were seen regardless of caffeine intake habits. That is to say, even they were in the high habitual intake group, the benefits from caffeine were the same.</p> <p>It would appear that regardless of whether or not you consume a lot of caffeine, you can still reap all the ergogenic benefits of the stimulant. However, I am curious to see if we would see the same results in a strength training context. Also, it is worth noting that these results can only be generalized to males.</p> <p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Whether you use a lot of caffeine or not, you will not build a tolerance and not experience less benefits during training.</p> <p>\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014</p> <p>Areta, J.

            "comment": "<p><div class=\"md\"><p>Hey guys, it\u2019s been awhile! Hope you are all having a wonderful Chinese new year for those who celebrate. As usual, I\u2019ve collected a few interesting studies and wrote short summaries of them for all of you to read. All for educational purposes and to spark some discussion. The paper on sleep is not entirely related to fitness but it is health-related and I thought it would be interesting nonetheless.</p> <p>The first study we will look at is a review written by Schoenfeld &amp; Aragon (2018) and it asks the question: how much protein can muscles use for growth in one meal? This is actually a common question thrown around in the fitness world as a lot of people want to be as efficient as possible and want to maximize protein\u2019s effects on muscle growth in each meal. However, as odd as it sounds, sometimes the question is asked incorrectly. For the question above, some people will ask how much protein can be absorbed in one meal as opposed to how much can be used for muscle growth maximally. All protein will be absorbed but the real question is what happens to all of it afterwards.</p> <p>The review highlights the study conducted by Areta et al. (2013) which is commonly cited to say that 20\u201325 grams of protein is the maximum number that muscles can use for hypertrophy (muscular growth). In this study, trained individuals were given different amounts of protein in a 12 hour period post-workout. Some were supplemented with 10 grams every 1.5 hours, some 20 grams every 3 hours and some 40 grams every 6 hours. In this experiment, the group that consumed 20 grams had the greatest rates of muscle protein synthesis (a fancy term to describe the building of muscles with protein). This would suggest that eating around 20 grams of protein at a time would be the best for building muscle. The biggest limitation that this review noted in the aforementioned study was that the total protein amounts used over the 12 hour period were quite low practically. Individuals training for hypertrophy would be consuming much greater amounts of protein overall.</p> <p>To challenge the previous study, the review presents a paper done by Macnaughton et al. (2016) in which 40 grams of protein elicited greater muscle protein synthesis than 20 grams in the context of full body training. Another experiment carried out by Kim et al. (2016) found that 70g of beef protein showed a more significant anabolic response than 40g of beef protein. However, it should be noted that this response was measured as a whole body response and not just for muscle protein synthesis. Therefore, it is impossible to say which amount is better for muscle protein synthesis in the context of this study.</p> <p>For women, Arnal et al. (1999, 2000) found that one meal with a large amount of protein was better than the same amount spread across several meals in regards to muscle retention. These results are interesting but a limitation to extrapolation is that no resistance training was taking place amongst the subjects.</p> <p>Muscle retention is also similar between those who follow intermittent fasting and those who diet continuously (Seimon et al., 2015). This would suggest that daily protein taken all at once would have the same effects on muscle as spreading out your protein intake across the day.</p> <p>In the end, the authors of this review recommend 0.4\u20130.55 g/kg/meal which follows daily recommended intakes stated in a meta-analysis produced by Morton et al. (2017).</p> <p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> It still is not clear what the optimum number of grams of protein per meal for maximizing muscular growth is but 0.4\u20130.55 g/kg/meal appears to be a safe recommendation based on the current literature.</p> <p>\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014</p> <p>We will now eat into a study done by Lee et al. (2018) in which differences between the conventional deadlift and the Romanian deadlift were investigated. For those who do not know what a Romanian deadlift is, it is essentially a normal deadlift starting from the top (barbell at waist) and then descending the barbell down until the hamstrings cannot stretch any further while not flexing at the lumbar spine. The knees cannot bend further than roughly 15 degrees. It may sound like a stiff-legged deadlift, however, in a stiff legged deadlift, you generally start from the bottom and your knees are allowed to bend more allowing you to bring the barbell to the floor. If you are referring to the straight-legged deadlift, the knees would not flex at all and the barbell would not drag along the legs in the descent.</p> <p>The study recruited 21 males with at least 3 years of both conventional and Romanian deadlift experience with their training occurring at least twice a week. The first day involved 1 repetition maximum testing as this would facilitate selecting the appropriate load for the participants during the trial (subjects would be doing 5 reps of each lift at 70% of their 1 repetition maximum). To examine muscle activation, the scientists used electromyography. To put it simply, this is where electrodes are pasted over certain muscles to measure the electrical activity from the muscles.</p> <p>The conventional deadlift showed more activation in the rectus femoris (a quadricep muscle, one that helps extend your knee and flex your hip) and slightly more activation in the gluteus maximus (your butt). Activation of the biceps femoris (a hamstring muscle) was similar between the two lifts which is interesting considering that many believe that the Romanian deadlift helps target the hamstrings better compared to the conventional deadlift.</p> <p>Torque (force produced about a joint) was much higher in the knee for the conventional deadlift which was probably expected considering the knee goes through a much larger range of motion. Similarly, the torque measured at the ankles were also higher in the conventional deadlifts which may suggest higher calf muscle activity though this was not measured in the study.</p> <p>Some important design aspects to note that affect generalizability is that we may see different results with different loads/intensities. Another issue regarding intensity is that the loads were selected according to the 1 repetition maximum of the subject\u2019s Romanian deadlift. Therefore, the conventional deadlift loads may not truly be 70% of their conventional deadlift 1 repetition maximum. It is safe to say that the intensities in this study were likely not matched. Finally, the hamstrings consist of several muscles but only one hamstring muscle was observed during the experiment.</p> <p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> The conventional deadlift may be better at targetting the quadriceps and the gluteal muscles. Against what is commonly thought, the Romanian deadlift may not be better than the conventional deadlift at hitting the hamstrings, however, more comprehensive electromyography analysis should be done before making a solid statement.</p> <p>\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014</p> <p>A large study conducted by Wild et al. (2018) explored the effects of duration of sleep on cognition. The team created a questionnaire which tested various human cognitive aspects like short-term memory, reasoning, spatial working and planning. However, the main areas that were being observed were short term memory, reasoning and verbal ability. At the same time, questions about sleep were asked to see the relationship between the person\u2019s sleep and their cognitive ability. The questionnaire was set up as an online survey in which they were able to gather 10,886 subjects.</p> <p>Firstly, it appears that as a person ages, their sleep duration decreases.</p> <p>All areas of cognition were affected by sleep duration except for short term memory. This is likely because short term memory is a low-order cognitive process, it is not as complex as something like problem solving. Looking at the graphs below, we can clearly see an inverted-U for almost all cognitive areas which tells us that both too little and too much sleep has negative effects on cognition. Even when the authors thinned the analyzed subjects by removing extremes from both ends of the results, they still saw the inverted-U.</p> <p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/NFHXzuV\" target=\"_blank\">https://imgur.com/NFHXzuV</a></p> <p>The most optimal sleep duration for overall cognitive ability according to these results is 7.38 hours. Any duration over 8 hours likely has a negative effect on cognition and the authors were able to reliably find negative effects below 6.26 hours of sleep. It was also highlighted that even a single night of sleep had effects on cognition the next day. People who are chronically poor sleepers can benefit from just a single night of good quality sleep and the same vice-versa (good sleepers are affected by one bad night). Sleeping less than usual or sleeping 2.76 hours more than usual on one night showed negative effects for cognition on average.</p> <p>Despite sleep duration decreasing with age, the results showed that age has no effect on the relationship between sleep duration and cognitive ability. An interesting fact illustrated by this study is that if one were to sleep less than four hours in a night, you would experience a cognitive impairment that is the same as adding 8 years to your age (cognitive ability worsens with age).</p> <p>Clear limitations of this study include the cross-sectional nature of the study (we are only looking at a snapshot of these people\u2019s lives, long term effects of sleep duration are not seen), the lack of people over 70 years old as well as children / adolescents and the fact that all these results were self-reported. Regarding the last point, the authors explain that the self-reporting still has moderate correlation with objective data.</p> <p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Getting 7 hours of sleep appears to be optimal for cognition. Sleeping any less or more shows some cognitive deficit. Even a one night\u2019s sleep can show acute effects on cognition.</p> <p>\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014</p> <p>The next study is a new meta-analysis done by Grgic et al. (2019) seeing whether or not the time of the day you do your training has an effect on muscle growth or strength. A meta analysis is where you pool the results of several studies together and is generally seen as the greatest form of scientific evidence. Previous research appears to be equivocal in regards to the effects of training time and muscle strength/growth with some studies showing a more positive effect in evening training and some presenting no difference at all between times.</p> <p>In total, the authors collected 11 studies for analysis. At baseline, people were stronger in the evening which suggests that people are naturally stronger in the evening. The authors postulate that this could be due to increased body temperatures in the evening or perhaps some hormonal reason. People who trained in the morning had no difference between strength tests in the morning or evening. However, those who trained the evening were stronger than they were in the morning. This introduces a benefit to morning training as it will make you stronger throughout the entire day in contrast to evening training which would only make you stronger in the evening. In terms of muscle hypertrophy, no differences were found at all.</p> <p>Unfortunately, all of these studies used maximal voluntary contractions to measure strength instead of 1 repetition maximum tests. 1 repetition maximum tests are more practical because they test the strength of movements that you actually train in the gym. There are also not many studies looking at time of training and muscle hypertrophy thus presenting a gap in the literature. Finally, the studies were quite heterogeneous in terms of participants\u2019 ages.</p> <p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> People seem to be stronger in the evening at baseline, however, unlike evening training, morning training will make you stronger throughout the entire day. Any conclusions regarding muscle growth is difficult to make due to the paucity of research on the subject though for now there appears to be no relationship.</p> <p>\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014</p> <p>The last paper we will look at was written by Gon\u00e7alves et al. (2017). Caffeine is a stimulant that is often consumed prior to training to boost muscular strength and endurance. Its effects are well documented and the research strongly supports caffeine as a valuable ergogenic aid (Grgic et al., 2018). The paper at hand investigated the effects of habitual caffeine intake on its efficacy during training. In other words, they ask if one were to consume caffeine regularly, would they build a tolerance to it and experience less of its benefits in training?</p> <p>The most likely theory for the way caffeine works is that it binds to adenosine receptors in the body. Amongst many functions, adenosine can make one feel sleepy and even bring down the heart rate of the body. Now, the worries that caffeine may have a reduced effect with habitual intake stem from the process where caffeine use will cause the body to create more adenosine receptors which allows more adenosine to bind to its receptors.</p> <p>The scientists recruited 40 male, trained cyclists to take part in the experiment. The study was designed in a crossover manner and in a double-blinded fashion. A crossover study means that all the participants got to try all treatments. In this case, every subject was supplemented with 6 mg/kg of caffeine for a week, was given a placebo for another week and was given nothing for another week. A double blind simply means that neither the scientists nor the subjects knew which treatment was being administered which helps reduce bias.</p> <p>The cyclists were grouped according to their caffeine intake prior to being recruited into the study. The low intake group consumed 58 mg/day on average, the moderate intake group at 143 mg/day and the high intake group at 351 mg/day. To put these numbers into perspective, the high intake group is worth about 4.5 250ml cans of Red Bull in terms of caffeine.</p> <p>The first day involved some simple body measurements as well as some testing to determine how much the cyclists needed to perform during real testing later on. The next couple of days consisted of familiarization with the time trial tests that the cyclists would have to do. The time trial basically required each cyclist to cycle a certain amount and then the time to completion would be measured. Caffeine 24 hours before the time trial was restricted and a 24 hour dietary recall before each test was also implemented to control caffeine intake. Subjects fasted 6 hours before each time trial and if they were being supplemented with 6 mg/kg of caffeine, it was done 1 hour before the time trial. Rate of perceived exertion was also measured throughout the trial.</p> <p>Cyclists performed 2\u20133% better when on caffeine compared to placebo/control. There was no difference between placebo and control. Rate of perceived exertion was similar between all treatments.</p> <p>The same trends were seen regardless of caffeine intake habits. That is to say, even they were in the high habitual intake group, the benefits from caffeine were the same.</p> <p>It would appear that regardless of whether or not you consume a lot of caffeine, you can still reap all the ergogenic benefits of the stimulant. However, I am curious to see if we would see the same results in a strength training context. Also, it is worth noting that these results can only be generalized to males.</p> <p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Whether you use a lot of caffeine or not, you will not build a tolerance and not experience less benefits during training.</p> <p>\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014</p> <p>Areta, J.

As usual, I\u2019ve collected a few interesting studies and wrote short summaries of them for all of you to read. All for educational purposes and to spark some discussion. The paper on sleep is not entirely related to fitness but it is health-related and I thought it would be interesting nonetheless.</p> <p>The first study we will look at is a review written by Schoenfeld &amp; Aragon (2018) and it asks the question: how much protein can muscles use for growth in one meal? This is actually a common question thrown around in the fitness world as a lot of people want to be as efficient as possible and want to maximize protein\u2019s effects on muscle growth in each meal. However, as odd as it sounds, sometimes the question is asked incorrectly. For the question above, some people will ask how much protein can be absorbed in one meal as opposed to how much can be used for muscle growth maximally. All protein will be absorbed but the real question is what happens to all of it afterwards.</p> <p>The review highlights the study conducted by Areta et al. (2013) which is commonly cited to say that 20\u201325 grams of protein is the maximum number that muscles can use for hypertrophy (muscular growth). In this study, trained individuals were given different amounts of protein in a 12 hour period post-workout. Some were supplemented with 10 grams every 1.5 hours, some 20 grams every 3 hours and some 40 grams every 6 hours. In this experiment, the group that consumed 20 grams had the greatest rates of muscle protein synthesis (a fancy term to describe the building of muscles with protein). This would suggest that eating around 20 grams of protein at a time would be the best for building muscle. The biggest limitation that this review noted in the aforementioned study was that the total protein amounts used over the 12 hour period were quite low practically. Individuals training for hypertrophy would be consuming much greater amounts of protein overall.</p> <p>To challenge the previous study, the review presents a paper done by Macnaughton et al. (2016) in which 40 grams of protein elicited greater muscle protein synthesis than 20 grams in the context of full body training. Another experiment carried out by Kim et al. (2016) found that 70g of beef protein showed a more significant anabolic response than 40g of beef protein. However, it should be noted that this response was measured as a whole body response and not just for muscle protein synthesis. Therefore, it is impossible to say which amount is better for muscle protein synthesis in the context of this study.</p> <p>For women, Arnal et al. (1999, 2000) found that one meal with a large amount of protein was better than the same amount spread across several meals in regards to muscle retention. These results are interesting but a limitation to extrapolation is that no resistance training was taking place amongst the subjects.</p> <p>Muscle retention is also similar between those who follow intermittent fasting and those who diet continuously (Seimon et al., 2015). This would suggest that daily protein taken all at once would have the same effects on muscle as spreading out your protein intake across the day.</p> <p>In the end, the authors of this review recommend 0.4\u20130.55 g/kg/meal which follows daily recommended intakes stated in a meta-analysis produced by Morton et al. (2017).</p> <p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> It still is not clear what the optimum number of grams of protein per meal for maximizing muscular growth is but 0.4\u20130.55 g/kg/meal appears to be a safe recommendation based on the current literature.</p> <p>\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014</p> <p>We will now eat into a study done by Lee et al. (2018) in which differences between the conventional deadlift and the Romanian deadlift were investigated. For those who do not know what a Romanian deadlift is, it is essentially a normal deadlift starting from the top (barbell at waist) and then descending the barbell down until the hamstrings cannot stretch any further while not flexing at the lumbar spine. The knees cannot bend further than roughly 15 degrees. It may sound like a stiff-legged deadlift, however, in a stiff legged deadlift, you generally start from the bottom and your knees are allowed to bend more allowing you to bring the barbell to the floor. If you are referring to the straight-legged deadlift, the knees would not flex at all and the barbell would not drag along the legs in the descent.</p> <p>The study recruited 21 males with at least 3 years of both conventional and Romanian deadlift experience with their training occurring at least twice a week. The first day involved 1 repetition maximum testing as this would facilitate selecting the appropriate load for the participants during the trial (subjects would be doing 5 reps of each lift at 70% of their 1 repetition maximum). To examine muscle activation, the scientists used electromyography. To put it simply, this is where electrodes are pasted over certain muscles to measure the electrical activity from the muscles.</p> <p>The conventional deadlift showed more activation in the rectus femoris (a quadricep muscle, one that helps extend your knee and flex your hip) and slightly more activation in the gluteus maximus (your butt). Activation of the biceps femoris (a hamstring muscle) was similar between the two lifts which is interesting considering that many believe that the Romanian deadlift helps target the hamstrings better compared to the conventional deadlift.</p> <p>Torque (force produced about a joint) was much higher in the knee for the conventional deadlift which was probably expected considering the knee goes through a much larger range of motion. Similarly, the torque measured at the ankles were also higher in the conventional deadlifts which may suggest higher calf muscle activity though this was not measured in the study.</p> <p>Some important design aspects to note that affect generalizability is that we may see different results with different loads/intensities. Another issue regarding intensity is that the loads were selected according to the 1 repetition maximum of the subject\u2019s Romanian deadlift. Therefore, the conventional deadlift loads may not truly be 70% of their conventional deadlift 1 repetition maximum. It is safe to say that the intensities in this study were likely not matched. Finally, the hamstrings consist of several muscles but only one hamstring muscle was observed during the experiment.</p> <p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> The conventional deadlift may be better at targetting the quadriceps and the gluteal muscles. Against what is commonly thought, the Romanian deadlift may not be better than the conventional deadlift at hitting the hamstrings, however, more comprehensive electromyography analysis should be done before making a solid statement.</p> <p>\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014</p> <p>A large study conducted by Wild et al. (2018) explored the effects of duration of sleep on cognition. The team created a questionnaire which tested various human cognitive aspects like short-term memory, reasoning, spatial working and planning. However, the main areas that were being observed were short term memory, reasoning and verbal ability. At the same time, questions about sleep were asked to see the relationship between the person\u2019s sleep and their cognitive ability. The questionnaire was set up as an online survey in which they were able to gather 10,886 subjects.</p> <p>Firstly, it appears that as a person ages, their sleep duration decreases.</p> <p>All areas of cognition were affected by sleep duration except for short term memory. This is likely because short term memory is a low-order cognitive process, it is not as complex as something like problem solving. Looking at the graphs below, we can clearly see an inverted-U for almost all cognitive areas which tells us that both too little and too much sleep has negative effects on cognition. Even when the authors thinned the analyzed subjects by removing extremes from both ends of the results, they still saw the inverted-U.</p> <p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/NFHXzuV\" target=\"_blank\">https://imgur.com/NFHXzuV</a></p> <p>The most optimal sleep duration for overall cognitive ability according to these results is 7.38 hours. Any duration over 8 hours likely has a negative effect on cognition and the authors were able to reliably find negative effects below 6.26 hours of sleep. It was also highlighted that even a single night of sleep had effects on cognition the next day. People who are chronically poor sleepers can benefit from just a single night of good quality sleep and the same vice-versa (good sleepers are affected by one bad night). Sleeping less than usual or sleeping 2.76 hours more than usual on one night showed negative effects for cognition on average.</p> <p>Despite sleep duration decreasing with age, the results showed that age has no effect on the relationship between sleep duration and cognitive ability. An interesting fact illustrated by this study is that if one were to sleep less than four hours in a night, you would experience a cognitive impairment that is the same as adding 8 years to your age (cognitive ability worsens with age).</p> <p>Clear limitations of this study include the cross-sectional nature of the study (we are only looking at a snapshot of these people\u2019s lives, long term effects of sleep duration are not seen), the lack of people over 70 years old as well as children / adolescents and the fact that all these results were self-reported. Regarding the last point, the authors explain that the self-reporting still has moderate correlation with objective data.</p> <p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Getting 7 hours of sleep appears to be optimal for cognition. Sleeping any less or more shows some cognitive deficit. Even a one night\u2019s sleep can show acute effects on cognition.</p> <p>\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014</p> <p>The next study is a new meta-analysis done by Grgic et al. (2019) seeing whether or not the time of the day you do your training has an effect on muscle growth or strength. A meta analysis is where you pool the results of several studies together and is generally seen as the greatest form of scientific evidence. Previous research appears to be equivocal in regards to the effects of training time and muscle strength/growth with some studies showing a more positive effect in evening training and some presenting no difference at all between times.</p> <p>In total, the authors collected 11 studies for analysis. At baseline, people were stronger in the evening which suggests that people are naturally stronger in the evening. The authors postulate that this could be due to increased body temperatures in the evening or perhaps some hormonal reason. People who trained in the morning had no difference between strength tests in the morning or evening. However, those who trained the evening were stronger than they were in the morning. This introduces a benefit to morning training as it will make you stronger throughout the entire day in contrast to evening training which would only make you stronger in the evening. In terms of muscle hypertrophy, no differences were found at all.</p> <p>Unfortunately, all of these studies used maximal voluntary contractions to measure strength instead of 1 repetition maximum tests. 1 repetition maximum tests are more practical because they test the strength of movements that you actually train in the gym. There are also not many studies looking at time of training and muscle hypertrophy thus presenting a gap in the literature. Finally, the studies were quite heterogeneous in terms of participants\u2019 ages.</p> <p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> People seem to be stronger in the evening at baseline, however, unlike evening training, morning training will make you stronger throughout the entire day. Any conclusions regarding muscle growth is difficult to make due to the paucity of research on the subject though for now there appears to be no relationship.</p> <p>\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014</p> <p>The last paper we will look at was written by Gon\u00e7alves et al. (2017). Caffeine is a stimulant that is often consumed prior to training to boost muscular strength and endurance. Its effects are well documented and the research strongly supports caffeine as a valuable ergogenic aid (Grgic et al., 2018). The paper at hand investigated the effects of habitual caffeine intake on its efficacy during training. In other words, they ask if one were to consume caffeine regularly, would they build a tolerance to it and experience less of its benefits in training?</p> <p>The most likely theory for the way caffeine works is that it binds to adenosine receptors in the body. Amongst many functions, adenosine can make one feel sleepy and even bring down the heart rate of the body. Now, the worries that caffeine may have a reduced effect with habitual intake stem from the process where caffeine use will cause the body to create more adenosine receptors which allows more adenosine to bind to its receptors.</p> <p>The scientists recruited 40 male, trained cyclists to take part in the experiment. The study was designed in a crossover manner and in a double-blinded fashion. A crossover study means that all the participants got to try all treatments. In this case, every subject was supplemented with 6 mg/kg of caffeine for a week, was given a placebo for another week and was given nothing for another week. A double blind simply means that neither the scientists nor the subjects knew which treatment was being administered which helps reduce bias.</p> <p>The cyclists were grouped according to their caffeine intake prior to being recruited into the study. The low intake group consumed 58 mg/day on average, the moderate intake group at 143 mg/day and the high intake group at 351 mg/day. To put these numbers into perspective, the high intake group is worth about 4.5 250ml cans of Red Bull in terms of caffeine.</p> <p>The first day involved some simple body measurements as well as some testing to determine how much the cyclists needed to perform during real testing later on. The next couple of days consisted of familiarization with the time trial tests that the cyclists would have to do. The time trial basically required each cyclist to cycle a certain amount and then the time to completion would be measured. Caffeine 24 hours before the time trial was restricted and a 24 hour dietary recall before each test was also implemented to control caffeine intake. Subjects fasted 6 hours before each time trial and if they were being supplemented with 6 mg/kg of caffeine, it was done 1 hour before the time trial. Rate of perceived exertion was also measured throughout the trial.</p> <p>Cyclists performed 2\u20133% better when on caffeine compared to placebo/control. There was no difference between placebo and control. Rate of perceived exertion was similar between all treatments.</p> <p>The same trends were seen regardless of caffeine intake habits. That is to say, even they were in the high habitual intake group, the benefits from caffeine were the same.</p> <p>It would appear that regardless of whether or not you consume a lot of caffeine, you can still reap all the ergogenic benefits of the stimulant. However, I am curious to see if we would see the same results in a strength training context. Also, it is worth noting that these results can only be generalized to males.</p> <p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Whether you use a lot of caffeine or not, you will not build a tolerance and not experience less benefits during training.</p> <p>\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014</p> <p>Areta, J.

The first day involved 1 repetition maximum testing as this would facilitate selecting the appropriate load for the participants during the trial (subjects would be doing 5 reps of each lift at 70% of their 1 repetition maximum). To examine muscle activation, the scientists used electromyography. To put it simply, this is where electrodes are pasted over certain muscles to measure the electrical activity from the muscles.</p> <p>The conventional deadlift showed more activation in the rectus femoris (a quadricep muscle, one that helps extend your knee and flex your hip) and slightly more activation in the gluteus maximus (your butt). Activation of the biceps femoris (a hamstring muscle) was similar between the two lifts which is interesting considering that many believe that the Romanian deadlift helps target the hamstrings better compared to the conventional deadlift.</p> <p>Torque (force produced about a joint) was much higher in the knee for the conventional deadlift which was probably expected considering the knee goes through a much larger range of motion. Similarly, the torque measured at the ankles were also higher in the conventional deadlifts which may suggest higher calf muscle activity though this was not measured in the study.</p> <p>Some important design aspects to note that affect generalizability is that we may see different results with different loads/intensities. Another issue regarding intensity is that the loads were selected according to the 1 repetition maximum of the subject&rsquo;s Romanian deadlift. Therefore, the conventional deadlift loads may not truly be 70% of their conventional deadlift 1 repetition maximum. It is safe to say that the intensities in this study were likely not matched. Finally, the hamstrings consist of several muscles but only one hamstring muscle was observed during the experiment.</p> <p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> The conventional deadlift may be better at targetting the quadriceps and the gluteal muscles. Against what is commonly thought, the Romanian deadlift may not be better than the conventional deadlift at hitting the hamstrings, however, more comprehensive electromyography analysis should be done before making a solid statement.</p> <p>&mdash;&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;&mdash;</p> <p>A large study conducted by Wild et al. (2018) explored the effects of duration of sleep on cognition. The team created a questionnaire which tested various human cognitive aspects like short-term memory, reasoning, spatial working and planning. However, the main areas that were being observed were short term memory, reasoning and verbal ability. At the same time, questions about sleep were asked to see the relationship between the person&rsquo;s sleep and their cognitive ability. The questionnaire was set up as an online survey in which they were able to gather 10,886 subjects.</p> <p>Firstly, it appears that as a person ages, their sleep duration decreases.</p> <p>All areas of cognition were affected by sleep duration except for short term memory. This is likely because short term memory is a low-order cognitive process, it is not as complex as something like problem solving. Looking at the graphs below, we can clearly see an inverted-U for almost all cognitive areas which tells us that both too little and too much sleep has negative effects on cognition. Even when the authors thinned the analyzed subjects by removing extremes from both ends of the results, they still saw the inverted-U.</p> <p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/NFHXzuV\" target=\"_blank\">https://imgur.com/NFHXzuV</a></p> <p>The most optimal sleep duration for overall cognitive ability according to these results is 7.38 hours. Any duration over 8 hours likely has a negative effect on cognition and the authors were able to reliably find negative effects below 6.26 hours of sleep. It was also highlighted that even a single night of sleep had effects on cognition the next day. People who are chronically poor sleepers can benefit from just a single night of good quality sleep and the same vice-versa (good sleepers are affected by one bad night). Sleeping less than usual or sleeping 2.76 hours more than usual on one night showed negative effects for cognition on average.</p> <p>Despite sleep duration decreasing with age, the results showed that age has no effect on the relationship between sleep duration and cognitive ability. An interesting fact illustrated by this study is that if one were to sleep less than four hours in a night, you would experience a cognitive impairment that is the same as adding 8 years to your age (cognitive ability worsens with age).</p> <p>Clear limitations of this study include the cross-sectional nature of the study (we are only looking at a snapshot of these people&rsquo;s lives, long term effects of sleep duration are not seen), the lack of people over 70 years old as well as children / adolescents and the fact that all these results were self-reported. Regarding the last point, the authors explain that the self-reporting still has moderate correlation with objective data.</p> <p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Getting 7 hours of sleep appears to be optimal for cognition. Sleeping any less or more shows some cognitive deficit. Even a one night&rsquo;s sleep can show acute effects on cognition.</p> <p>&mdash;&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;&mdash;</p> <p>The next study is a new meta-analysis done by Grgic et al. (2019) seeing whether or not the time of the day you do your training has an effect on muscle growth or strength. A meta analysis is where you pool the results of several studies together and is generally seen as the greatest form of scientific evidence. Previous research appears to be equivocal in regards to the effects of training time and muscle strength/growth with some studies showing a more positive effect in evening training and some presenting no difference at all between times.</p> <p>In total, the authors collected 11 studies for analysis. At baseline, people were stronger in the evening which suggests that people are naturally stronger in the evening. The authors postulate that this could be due to increased body temperatures in the evening or perhaps some hormonal reason. People who trained in the morning had no difference between strength tests in the morning or evening. However, those who trained the evening were stronger than they were in the morning. This introduces a benefit to morning training as it will make you stronger throughout the entire day in contrast to evening training which would only make you stronger in the evening. In terms of muscle hypertrophy, no differences were found at all.</p> <p>Unfortunately, all of these studies used maximal voluntary contractions to measure strength instead of 1 repetition maximum tests. 1 repetition maximum tests are more practical because they test the strength of movements that you actually train in the gym. There are also not many studies looking at time of training and muscle hypertrophy thus presenting a gap in the literature. Finally, the studies were quite heterogeneous in terms of participants&rsquo; ages.</p> <p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> People seem to be stronger in the evening at baseline, however, unlike evening training, morning training will make you stronger throughout the entire day. Any conclusions regarding muscle growth is difficult to make due to the paucity of research on the subject though for now there appears to be no relationship.</p> <p>&mdash;&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;&mdash;</p> <p>The last paper we will look at was written by Gon&ccedil;alves et al. (2017). Caffeine is a stimulant that is often consumed prior to training to boost muscular strength and endurance. Its effects are well documented and the research strongly supports caffeine as a valuable ergogenic aid (Grgic et al., 2018). The paper at hand investigated the effects of habitual caffeine intake on its efficacy during training. In other words, they ask if one were to consume caffeine regularly, would they build a tolerance to it and experience less of its benefits in training?</p> <p>The most likely theory for the way caffeine works is that it binds to adenosine receptors in the body. Amongst many functions, adenosine can make one feel sleepy and even bring down the heart rate of the body. Now, the worries that caffeine may have a reduced effect with habitual intake stem from the process where caffeine use will cause the body to create more adenosine receptors which allows more adenosine to bind to its receptors.</p> <p>The scientists recruited 40 male, trained cyclists to take part in the experiment. The study was designed in a crossover manner and in a double-blinded fashion. A crossover study means that all the participants got to try all treatments. In this case, every subject was supplemented with 6 mg/kg of caffeine for a week, was given a placebo for another week and was given nothing for another week. A double blind simply means that neither the scientists nor the subjects knew which treatment was being administered which helps reduce bias.</p> <p>The cyclists were grouped according to their caffeine intake prior to being recruited into the study. The low intake group consumed 58 mg/day on average, the moderate intake group at 143 mg/day and the high intake group at 351 mg/day. To put these numbers into perspective, the high intake group is worth about 4.5 250ml cans of Red Bull in terms of caffeine.</p> <p>The first day involved some simple body measurements as well as some testing to determine how much the cyclists needed to perform during real testing later on. The next couple of days consisted of familiarization with the time trial tests that the cyclists would have to do. The time trial basically required each cyclist to cycle a certain amount and then the time to completion would be measured. Caffeine 24 hours before the time trial was restricted and a 24 hour dietary recall before each test was also implemented to control caffeine intake. Subjects fasted 6 hours before each time trial and if they were being supplemented with 6 mg/kg of caffeine, it was done 1 hour before the time trial. Rate of perceived exertion was also measured throughout the trial.</p> <p>Cyclists performed 2&ndash;3% better when on caffeine compared to placebo/control. There was no difference between placebo and control. Rate of perceived exertion was similar between all treatments.</p> <p>The same trends were seen regardless of caffeine intake habits. That is to say, even they were in the high habitual intake group, the benefits from caffeine were the same.</p> <p>It would appear that regardless of whether or not you consume a lot of caffeine, you can still reap all the ergogenic benefits of the stimulant. However, I am curious to see if we would see the same results in a strength training context. Also, it is worth noting that these results can only be generalized to males.</p> <p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Whether you use a lot of caffeine or not, you will not build a tolerance and not experience less benefits during training.</p> <p>&mdash;&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;&mdash;</p> <p>Areta, J.
