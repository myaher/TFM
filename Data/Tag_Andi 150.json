But with TJ, he seems \nto be at a loss for words. When they get paired up for a summer \nassignment, Cyrus slowly starts to build a new dictionary. One that \ninvolves TJ and everything they do together. Along the way, maybe he\u2019ll \nfind the words to tell him how he feels.</p><p><b>Chapter 17: </b>Saudade<br/></p><p><b>Word Count: </b>2252</p><p><i>Read on AO3</i><br/></p><hr><p>Two weeks. <i>Two weeks</i>.</p><p>It might as well have been two years, Cyrus assumed. TJ had been on vacation for two weeks (thirteen days to be more exact), and Cyrus had never missed anyone more. He knew that TJ wasn\u2019t gone, per se, but he missed him; he missed running his hands through his hair, holding hands and falling asleep next to him, kissing him until he felt like he couldn\u2019t breathe.</p><p><i>saudade: missing someone so much that it physically hurts</i></p><p>To try and distract himself, he hung out with Buffy as much as he could, considering he couldn\u2019t go to Andi.</p><p>\u201cYou have to talk to her,\u201d Buffy mumbled into the phone.</p><p>\u201cWhat if she hates me? It\u2019s been a long time,\u201d he worried, pacing around his small room.</p><p>\u201cCyrus, Andi loves you. You know she wouldn\u2019t stay mad at you forever. She really cares about you,\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate it when you\u2019re right,\u201d he grumbled, hanging up and grabbing a pair of shoes.</p><hr><!-- more --><p>It felt oddly chilly outside, considering Cyrus had to rub his biceps furiously as he walked to Andi\u2019s house. The closer he got, it appeared, the harder it was to move his legs forward. It was as if he was being held back by cement.</p><p><i>Step</i>.</p><p>Everything was going to be okay, right? Buffy was usually right, so why shouldn\u2019t he believed her now?</p><p><i>Step</i>.</p><p>Nope, bad idea, bad idea. Why not just give up now? What\u2019s one less friend.</p><p><i>Step.</i></p><p>No, he could do this. Things were going to be okay; they were going to sort things out.</p><p>He knocked twice, albeit shakily, and waited. And waited. And waited. Maybe this was a bad idea. Maybe Andi really didn\u2019t want to talk to him and was purposely avoiding him. Or&hellip;maybe she just wasn\u2019t home. Or maybe-</p><p>Before he could finish that thought, the door swung open. And it looked like Andi was almost smiling, but the moment she saw Cyrus, her face fell.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d she murmured, staring down at her feet. She dug her toes into the carpet, trying to distract herself.</p><p>\u201cCan I come in?\u201d</p><p>She nodded weakly, stepping aside for him. Cyrus slipped his shoes off, and she nodded up the stairs, Cyrus following behind her. It felt like he hadn\u2019t been up here in ages. He\u2019d missed having sleepovers with her and Buffy; they had mostly stopped once they\u2019d entered high school because they just didn\u2019t have time anymore.</p><p>The moment that they sat on the bed, the words flowed out quickly, as if they were held back by a dam.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I yelled at you,\u201d he began, \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to be so rude, I\u2019m so sorry, Andi. I just&hellip;when you were talking about me and TJ, I just thought it was something so outlandish,\u201d</p><p>Andi nodded silently, breathing out softly. \u201cSorry for meddling,\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be apologizing, I should. And I\u2019m sorry,\u201d he murmured, putting his hand on Andi\u2019s shoulder. Her lips twitched up into a hesitant smile, the tension in the room easing up a little. She pulled him in for a hug, and there they stayed for a little while.</p><p>\u201cPlus you were right,\u201d Cyrus added, an impish grin gracing his face, \u201cabout me and TJ,\u201d</p><p>Her whole face lit up, clapping her hands in excitement. \u201cCyrus!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, how\u2019s it been with you two? Tell me <i>everything</i>,\u201d she insisted, propping her head up with her elbows, and batting her lashes.</p><p>Cyrus shrugged, but the smile on his face spoke for itself. \u201cIt\u2019s been great,\u201d he admitted, flopping back onto her bed and staring at the ceiling, \u201cI miss him though. He\u2019s been on vacation for almost two weeks. But he comes back in two days,\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you worried? About&hellip;him spending time with his mom?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus nodded, tracing over the seams of Andi\u2019s bedsheets. \u201cYeah,\u201d he said, his voice timid and nervous, \u201cI just hope he\u2019s okay,\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe will be. He\u2019s strong,\u201d she reminded him, placing a hand on his head, \u201cokay, no more sad talk. We should do something fun, you, me, and Buffy. I feel like we haven\u2019t hung out all summer,\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about a sleepover, like the kind we used to have in middle school?\u201d Cyrus suggested, \u201cI miss those,\u201d</p><p><b>the ghc</b></p><p><b>[andi: sleepover today? my house]</b></p><p><b>[buffy: can\u2019t wait, i\u2019ve missed things like this &lt;3]</b></p><p>\u201cBuffy\u2019s in. So&hellip;movies and junk food until we pass out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have it any other way,\u201d</p><hr><p>It was hot. Too hot. There was a reason TJ didn\u2019t like the beach; there was too much sand, the sun was never hidden, and the squacks of seagulls was anything but peaceful. How people could fall asleep, he had no idea. Not even his sunglasses helped him from squinting in order to not be blinded.</p><p>Amber seemed to have no problem with the beach; she loved the way the sun lightened her hair, the way the ocean breeze kissed every inch of her skin, the comfort in knowing she could simply lie down and do nothing.</p><p>\u201cDo you miss him?\u201d she asked, dragging her fingers through the sand.</p><p>Amber really could read his thoughts, couldn\u2019t she. \u201cYeah,\u201d he mumbled, \u201ca lot. I just wanna go home,\u201d he grumbled, staring off into the distance, where his mom was chatting with a group of ladies.</p><p>Amber scooted her chair closer putting a hand on her brother\u2019s arm. \u201c&hellip;I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll come around, TJ,\u201d she promised, watching as their mother mingled like she was at a party.</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, I\u2019m not so sure,\u201d he huffed, squirming under her touch, \u201cshe\u2019s barely said a word to either of us this entire trip. I mean, at least she talks to you a <i>little</i>, but she hasn\u2019t said anything to me,\u201d</p><p>Amber forced herself to not be irked by his movement. \u201cJust two more years and then you get to go to college,\u201d she tried, offering a sympathetic smile, \u201cguys like you are gonna be cool in college,\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t remind me,\u201d he groaned, putting his hands over his face, \u201cCyrus is going to go to some Ivy League on the other side of the coast, and I\u2019m going to go to some rinky-dink community college ten minutes from here,\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, don\u2019t say that,\u201d she pressed, pushing her sunglasses further up the bridge of her nose, \u201cyou could get a basketball scholarship,\u201d</p><p>TJ scoffed, shaking his head at the very idea. Sure, he loved basketball and yeah, he was pretty decent at it, but pretty decent wasn\u2019t going to peak the scouts\u2019 interests. \u201cIf I\u2019m lucky. I just don\u2019t want to think about going to college and having to&hellip;\u201d he trailed, the words unable to come out.</p><p>\u201c&hellip;break up with him?\u201d Amber finished for him.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he whispered, so softly that Amber nearly didn\u2019t hear him. Ah, the lovely feeling of vulnerability.</p><p>Amber felt a little guilty for bringing it up, a gnawing feeling in her stomach. \u201cHey,\u201d she gave his hand a squeeze, \u201cthat\u2019s a while from now. Live in the moment, right? Things are okay now,\u201d</p><p>TJ smiled, tilting his head back. \u201cYeah, things are okay,\u201d</p><hr><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve already seen Mulan a thousand times,\u201d Cyrus whined, leaning back against the couch and pulling his blanket up to his neck.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the best Disney movie,\u201d Buffy argued, selecting the movie while ignoring Cyrus\u2019 pleas.</p><p>\u201cHm, I think Beauty and the Beast begs to differ, but whatever,\u201d Andi mumbled, poking Buffy\u2019s side. It was harder now for them all to fit on the couch now that they had grown (now that Buffy and Andi had growth spurts, more specifically), but they didn\u2019t mind being pushed together. It was just like old times; movies, chip crumbs littering the couch cushions, and more blankets than were probably safe.</p><p>Cyrus barely paid attention to the movie. He spend most of the time checking his phone for any new texts. Andi and Buffy picked up on this, giving each other knowing looks.</p><p>\u201cTJ?\u201d they asked.</p><p>Cyrus felt his face burn, tucking his phone in his pocket. \u201cNo,\u201d he lied, \u201cnot&hellip;really, at least. He hasn\u2019t texted me,\u201d</p><p>Buffy\u2019s face softened, placing a hand on his arm. \u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019s just busy spending time with his mom and Amber,\u201d she soothed, \u201che\u2019ll text you when he can,\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you heard from Amber?\u201d Cyrus asked, turning to Andi.</p><p>\u201cA little,\u201d she admitted, \u201cshe said that their mom is trying to keep them occupied with things to do. She mostly just texts me before bed,\u201d</p><p>Cyrus nodded, feeling a bit more relieved. \u201cHow are things with you and Marty?\u201d</p><p>Buffy smirked, cracking her fingers. \u201cLet\u2019s just say that I haven\u2019t lost an arm wrestle,\u201d</p><p>Andi rolled her eyes, shaking her head. \u201cYou and only you would say that when someone asks you about your relationship,\u201d</p><p>Buffy chuckled, tossing a pillow at her. \u201cOh, hush, you. You\u2019re just jealous that me and Marty make a cuter couple than you and Amber,\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not jealous, because that\u2019s completely false,\u201d she countered, crossing her arms.</p><p>\u201cI think we\u2019re forgetting the point of this sleepover,\u201d Cyrus mumbled, smiling mischievously, \u201cthat <i>TJ and I</i> are the cutest couple,\u201d he insisted, turning up the TV loud enough so that he didn\u2019t hear Andi and Buffy coo over his affection for the other boy.</p><hr><p><i>\u201c&hellip;previously on Worst Cooks in America,\u201d</i></p><p>Jonah grumbled, grabbing a pillow and holding it to his chest. Maybe trying to binge two seasons of the show within two days was a mistake. His eyes burned every time he blinked, he was fairly certain he hadn\u2019t drank water for two days, and he was still in the same clothes.</p><p>Then came a knock at the door, and he tossed his pillow aside. His hands ran down his face; he really needed to wash his hair. Slinging his legs over the couch, he managed to get himself up and to the door. And once he opened it, he felt every part of his body jolt awake.</p><p>\u201cWalker!\u201d he cried, reaching forward and pulling him into a hug, \u201cGod, I missed you so much,\u201d he whispered into the other boy\u2019s shirt, clutching it tightly.</p><p>\u201cI missed you too,\u201d the other boy replied, quick to drop his bags and wrap his arms around Jonah, \u201chow was life here?\u201d</p><p>Jonah pulled back, shrugging. \u201cUneventful. Boring without you,\u201d he admitted, taking his bag and ushering him inside, \u201chow was Florida?\u201d</p><p>Walker rubbed his head, melting into the couch with a contented sigh. \u201cIt was alright. Nice to see relatives gush about how much I\u2019d grown. And meanwhile I\u2019m here like \u2018I\u2019m just going to hug this person I don\u2019t know\u2019,\u201d he chuckled, putting his feet up.</p><p>\u201cI know that feeling. That\u2019s what Easter is like when my mom hosts it,\u201d he shuddered, \u201cthe great Easter of \u201808 has still not left our minds,\u201d he added, \u201chow was the 4th of July down there?\u201d</p><p>Walker nearly rolled his eyes, pulling a pillow into his chest, his eyelids drooping down. \u201cLoud. Bright. A little overwhelming. I kinda wish you were there,\u201d</p><p>Jonah smirked, taking the boy\u2019s hand. \u201cOnly kinda?\u201d</p><p>Walker didn\u2019t have the energy to argue with him, so he just tugged him a little closer. \u201cShh,\u201d he hummed, \u201cI\u2019m tired, I just wanna sleep,\u201d</p><p>Jonah shook his head, his hair gently brushing the other. \u201cFine. But when you wake up, you better tell me more about all the fun you had without me,\u201d</p><p>Walker breathed out a laugh, shutting his eyes. \u201cYou mean like all the pretty girls I saw?\u201d</p><p>Jonah stuck his tongue out in response. \u201cDork,\u201d he mumbled, and when no response came, he knew Walker was probably asleep.</p><hr><p>\u201cI miss you so much Cyrus,\u201d TJ murmured, leaning against the sink. The bright lights made him squint at the other boy on the other side of the screen, but he wouldn\u2019t have it any other way.</p><p>\u201cI miss you too,\u201d he whispered, careful to not wake Andi and Buffy, who had fallen asleep recently, \u201cI just wanna give you a hug. How\u2019s the vacation going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really happy it\u2019s almost over,\u201d he admitted softly, \u201cit\u2019s been really&hellip;awkward,\u201d</p><p>Cyrus frowned; he wanted nothing more than to just reach through the screen and plant a soft kiss on TJ\u2019s forehead. Unfortunately, technology hadn\u2019t advanced that far yet. \u201cHow\u2019s your mom been?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s <i>been </i>ignoring me,\u201d he huffed, pouting, \u201cwhich I guess it better than her saying hurtful things. But I wish she\u2019d just treat me like she used to,\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you really soon, though. And then we\u2019ll get to hang out, just you and me. I love you,\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove you too,\u201d he murmured, shutting off the video chat, and slipping his phone into his pocket. It physically hurt him to be away from Cyrus for such a long time, but it was only for another day. He was getting back tomorrow; and the only people that knew were his mom and Amber, obviously, and Leslie. He\u2019d made sure to tell her to not say a work to Cyrus, and he was fairly certain that his plan had worked. He couldn\u2019t wait to see the look on Cyrus\u2019 face.</p><p>Crawling out of the bathroom he snuck into the bed with Amber, trying not to shake her awake.</p><p>\u201cTalking to Cyrus?\u201d she whispered, turning to face him.</p><p>He nodded, tugging the covers up to his neck. \u201cI miss him,\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll see him tomorrow,\u201d she reminded him, \u201cgood night,\u201d she turned onto her other side, tugging the covers a little closer to her.</p><p>\u201cNight,\u201d</p><p>Tag List: \n<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m7R6p_iU9G8Gh8chz1LUkOg\">@shortstackofpeaches || @seanna313</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mB_fjwbYnt6KH-iEEVWn8ig\">@geekingbeautytx</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mx3fTvftLAxW_PMMErDl_UA\">@heavenlybyers ||</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mr1BeThlMP6lSNdCv9_u98w\">@ginnychrises</a>|| <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mq4Fz3LkzWjZC-KqvwLI2IQ\">@wlwandimack</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mlcQ2RsNl23FLSXFuHW7LHA\">@giocondasstuff</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjInWsj0ClAwVBAeG3vRcVw\">@lemonboytyrus</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mNwMw7enpLkLc8PJbIgqIpA\">@adorejrizzle</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mqsacC6O0CwDxqCVXhKqKMg\">@swingsetboys</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m5HZenndZxervK_R1eUWPgA\">@ifellintotyrushell</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mlmDXY_IPGUhgMI0icEk5Fw\">@idk-dude-17</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/md3vq8Jj9kFqSljYsARejoQ\">@rbf-lesbian</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/miY4DTLwRG38LWUEXGrwqQQ\">@marianara-sauce</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mweSXXIeqHwnjzlxWq9XUDw\">@kaptainjinxz</a> || @<a href=\"http://alex-poster-pizz.tumblr.com\">alex-poster-pizz || </a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mPGweOqhfiAqow-tS0I2R6Q\">@quietmarvel</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mdvU81fYq0CNQvV5m2taDGQ\">@blueberry-my-hero-macadamia</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mcbji5TcL-VC-WOCJVAbpjw\">@broadwayitbitch</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mIrWwvtK767VFgc84SQnSmw\">@tjsmuffin</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mNxJK8EhlLcuAxp-Fy8ZbFA\">@tjthekippen</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mD5xwG2u8vIh_s73zuIGl0g\">@idpleasesir</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m7fdykeIYkcOXPu3bLUwexA\">@hi-hello-hey-there</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/miDxY6dUJGULGFxiGQ40Vzw\">@bingewatchingenthusiast</a>|| <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_McecsKdTsnfdqnR2ozw1A\">@booklove-2</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m3KYGYYNAKvqZ_XVFoSWXCg\">@illbeyourreasonwhy</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mEx0042yZEiHRJ3jMqTs-rA\">@birdiesandflowers</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m8CXsQC7iejVYW39YZtzCUg\">@whistlepunk</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m9sonAr6Kx-g7fLYWOoIENQ\">@phinallyjackie</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrTO_xWDLkyEgi4LFyByJMQ\">@thedampjofangirl</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mxUprLHny1HYleRX2Qz3B-Q\">@tyrus4eva</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mDtn4v-rJcfP7a0m51rQAIA\">@tj-is-a-lemony-boy</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mAvcCAzWMuhg5NFzViiC1Uw\">@tj-goodman-bittersweet-boy</a> || @dis-app-oin-tme-nt || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m6_PSslGMLadBwFf51HMVMw\">@nessarinthegay</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m2S891zBEolQhmvw94WEEpA\">@breadisticks</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYctS-TJVaIxMIM1KPeVP1A\">@typewriter-riz</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mpDM4OrcSo5OknyNg-7VgWg\">@gobletofash</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mgjuE9tqgzdBFlw3OUmAPYg\">@bluemuffinboy</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/myeSqX7QQrz4q4ZteKbmoCg\">@sofuuh</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mKemMX29wu_Y_MCi69LuIMQ\">@cheesystars</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfAL43lCQk6VEqq6AxC6GeQ\">@tjmuffin</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m-26HuYTBll7Hj1BqcsOZPA\">@multifandom-bxitch</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/muYk4KP0O5cWwKw3iozZ6nA\">@allylovessadie</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mCc7FcCPMxCd8PrWuydEr4w\">@hithatsmyname</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mFA7rW6-u7x3w8VNCK_KD7A\">@tyrusinarush</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mFMeKUhkzTWE7ubZ8HduqJA\">@tyrus-lookback</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mhwpAw_kQmNajYckySCFqAg\">@gaycefulwords</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/meUWCp5upJMOnRbGLOzvcxw\">@theobligatedklutz</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m3EOu5JFaQ22e0aezi7yabw\">@bambikippen</a> ||\n\n<br/></p>",

One that \ninvolves TJ and everything they do together. Along the way, maybe he\u2019ll \nfind the words to tell him how he feels.</p><p><b>Chapter 17: </b>Saudade<br></p><p><b>Word Count: </b>2252</p><p><i>Read on AO3</i><br></p><hr><p>Two weeks. <i>Two weeks</i>.</p><p>It might as well have been two years, Cyrus assumed. TJ had been on vacation for two weeks (thirteen days to be more exact), and Cyrus had never missed anyone more. He knew that TJ wasn\u2019t gone, per se, but he missed him; he missed running his hands through his hair, holding hands and falling asleep next to him, kissing him until he felt like he couldn\u2019t breathe.</p><p><i>saudade: missing someone so much that it physically hurts</i></p><p>To try and distract himself, he hung out with Buffy as much as he could, considering he couldn\u2019t go to Andi.</p><p>\u201cYou have to talk to her,\u201d Buffy mumbled into the phone.</p><p>\u201cWhat if she hates me? It\u2019s been a long time,\u201d he worried, pacing around his small room.</p><p>\u201cCyrus, Andi loves you. You know she wouldn\u2019t stay mad at you forever. She really cares about you,\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate it when you\u2019re right,\u201d he grumbled, hanging up and grabbing a pair of shoes.</p><hr>[[MORE]]<p>It felt oddly chilly outside, considering Cyrus had to rub his biceps furiously as he walked to Andi\u2019s house. The closer he got, it appeared, the harder it was to move his legs forward. It was as if he was being held back by cement.</p><p><i>Step</i>.</p><p>Everything was going to be okay, right? Buffy was usually right, so why shouldn\u2019t he believed her now?</p><p><i>Step</i>.</p><p>Nope, bad idea, bad idea. Why not just give up now? What\u2019s one less friend.</p><p><i>Step.</i></p><p>No, he could do this. Things were going to be okay; they were going to sort things out.</p><p>He knocked twice, albeit shakily, and waited. And waited. And waited. Maybe this was a bad idea. Maybe Andi really didn\u2019t want to talk to him and was purposely avoiding him. Or\u2026maybe she just wasn\u2019t home. Or maybe-</p><p>Before he could finish that thought, the door swung open. And it looked like Andi was almost smiling, but the moment she saw Cyrus, her face fell.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d she murmured, staring down at her feet. She dug her toes into the carpet, trying to distract herself.</p><p>\u201cCan I come in?\u201d</p><p>She nodded weakly, stepping aside for him. Cyrus slipped his shoes off, and she nodded up the stairs, Cyrus following behind her. It felt like he hadn\u2019t been up here in ages. He\u2019d missed having sleepovers with her and Buffy; they had mostly stopped once they\u2019d entered high school because they just didn\u2019t have time anymore.</p><p>The moment that they sat on the bed, the words flowed out quickly, as if they were held back by a dam.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I yelled at you,\u201d he began, \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to be so rude, I\u2019m so sorry, Andi. I just\u2026when you were talking about me and TJ, I just thought it was something so outlandish,\u201d</p><p>Andi nodded silently, breathing out softly. \u201cSorry for meddling,\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be apologizing, I should. And I\u2019m sorry,\u201d he murmured, putting his hand on Andi\u2019s shoulder. Her lips twitched up into a hesitant smile, the tension in the room easing up a little. She pulled him in for a hug, and there they stayed for a little while.</p><p>\u201cPlus you were right,\u201d Cyrus added, an impish grin gracing his face, \u201cabout me and TJ,\u201d</p><p>Her whole face lit up, clapping her hands in excitement. \u201cCyrus!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, how\u2019s it been with you two? Tell me <i>everything</i>,\u201d she insisted, propping her head up with her elbows, and batting her lashes.</p><p>Cyrus shrugged, but the smile on his face spoke for itself. \u201cIt\u2019s been great,\u201d he admitted, flopping back onto her bed and staring at the ceiling, \u201cI miss him though. He\u2019s been on vacation for almost two weeks. But he comes back in two days,\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you worried? About\u2026him spending time with his mom?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus nodded, tracing over the seams of Andi\u2019s bedsheets. \u201cYeah,\u201d he said, his voice timid and nervous, \u201cI just hope he\u2019s okay,\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe will be. He\u2019s strong,\u201d she reminded him, placing a hand on his head, \u201cokay, no more sad talk. We should do something fun, you, me, and Buffy. I feel like we haven\u2019t hung out all summer,\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about a sleepover, like the kind we used to have in middle school?\u201d Cyrus suggested, \u201cI miss those,\u201d</p><p><b>the ghc</b></p><p><b>[andi: sleepover today? my house]</b></p><p><b>[buffy: can\u2019t wait, i\u2019ve missed things like this &lt;3]</b></p><p>\u201cBuffy\u2019s in. So\u2026movies and junk food until we pass out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have it any other way,\u201d</p><hr><p>It was hot. Too hot. There was a reason TJ didn\u2019t like the beach; there was too much sand, the sun was never hidden, and the squacks of seagulls was anything but peaceful. How people could fall asleep, he had no idea. Not even his sunglasses helped him from squinting in order to not be blinded.</p><p>Amber seemed to have no problem with the beach; she loved the way the sun lightened her hair, the way the ocean breeze kissed every inch of her skin, the comfort in knowing she could simply lie down and do nothing.</p><p>\u201cDo you miss him?\u201d she asked, dragging her fingers through the sand.</p><p>Amber really could read his thoughts, couldn\u2019t she. \u201cYeah,\u201d he mumbled, \u201ca lot. I just wanna go home,\u201d he grumbled, staring off into the distance, where his mom was chatting with a group of ladies.</p><p>Amber scooted her chair closer putting a hand on her brother\u2019s arm. \u201c\u2026I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll come around, TJ,\u201d she promised, watching as their mother mingled like she was at a party.</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, I\u2019m not so sure,\u201d he huffed, squirming under her touch, \u201cshe\u2019s barely said a word to either of us this entire trip. I mean, at least she talks to you a <i>little</i>, but she hasn\u2019t said anything to me,\u201d</p><p>Amber forced herself to not be irked by his movement. \u201cJust two more years and then you get to go to college,\u201d she tried, offering a sympathetic smile, \u201cguys like you are gonna be cool in college,\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t remind me,\u201d he groaned, putting his hands over his face, \u201cCyrus is going to go to some Ivy League on the other side of the coast, and I\u2019m going to go to some rinky-dink community college ten minutes from here,\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, don\u2019t say that,\u201d she pressed, pushing her sunglasses further up the bridge of her nose, \u201cyou could get a basketball scholarship,\u201d</p><p>TJ scoffed, shaking his head at the very idea. Sure, he loved basketball and yeah, he was pretty decent at it, but pretty decent wasn\u2019t going to peak the scouts\u2019 interests. \u201cIf I\u2019m lucky. I just don\u2019t want to think about going to college and having to\u2026\u201d he trailed, the words unable to come out.</p><p>\u201c\u2026break up with him?\u201d Amber finished for him.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he whispered, so softly that Amber nearly didn\u2019t hear him. Ah, the lovely feeling of vulnerability.</p><p>Amber felt a little guilty for bringing it up, a gnawing feeling in her stomach. \u201cHey,\u201d she gave his hand a squeeze, \u201cthat\u2019s a while from now. Live in the moment, right? Things are okay now,\u201d</p><p>TJ smiled, tilting his head back. \u201cYeah, things are okay,\u201d</p><hr><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve already seen Mulan a thousand times,\u201d Cyrus whined, leaning back against the couch and pulling his blanket up to his neck.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the best Disney movie,\u201d Buffy argued, selecting the movie while ignoring Cyrus\u2019 pleas.</p><p>\u201cHm, I think Beauty and the Beast begs to differ, but whatever,\u201d Andi mumbled, poking Buffy\u2019s side. It was harder now for them all to fit on the couch now that they had grown (now that Buffy and Andi had growth spurts, more specifically), but they didn\u2019t mind being pushed together. It was just like old times; movies, chip crumbs littering the couch cushions, and more blankets than were probably safe.</p><p>Cyrus barely paid attention to the movie. He spend most of the time checking his phone for any new texts. Andi and Buffy picked up on this, giving each other knowing looks.</p><p>\u201cTJ?\u201d they asked.</p><p>Cyrus felt his face burn, tucking his phone in his pocket. \u201cNo,\u201d he lied, \u201cnot\u2026really, at least. He hasn\u2019t texted me,\u201d</p><p>Buffy\u2019s face softened, placing a hand on his arm. \u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019s just busy spending time with his mom and Amber,\u201d she soothed, \u201che\u2019ll text you when he can,\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you heard from Amber?\u201d Cyrus asked, turning to Andi.</p><p>\u201cA little,\u201d she admitted, \u201cshe said that their mom is trying to keep them occupied with things to do. She mostly just texts me before bed,\u201d</p><p>Cyrus nodded, feeling a bit more relieved. \u201cHow are things with you and Marty?\u201d</p><p>Buffy smirked, cracking her fingers. \u201cLet\u2019s just say that I haven\u2019t lost an arm wrestle,\u201d</p><p>Andi rolled her eyes, shaking her head. \u201cYou and only you would say that when someone asks you about your relationship,\u201d</p><p>Buffy chuckled, tossing a pillow at her. \u201cOh, hush, you. You\u2019re just jealous that me and Marty make a cuter couple than you and Amber,\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not jealous, because that\u2019s completely false,\u201d she countered, crossing her arms.</p><p>\u201cI think we\u2019re forgetting the point of this sleepover,\u201d Cyrus mumbled, smiling mischievously, \u201cthat <i>TJ and I</i> are the cutest couple,\u201d he insisted, turning up the TV loud enough so that he didn\u2019t hear Andi and Buffy coo over his affection for the other boy.</p><hr><p><i>\u201c\u2026previously on Worst Cooks in America,\u201d</i></p><p>Jonah grumbled, grabbing a pillow and holding it to his chest. Maybe trying to binge two seasons of the show within two days was a mistake. His eyes burned every time he blinked, he was fairly certain he hadn\u2019t drank water for two days, and he was still in the same clothes.</p><p>Then came a knock at the door, and he tossed his pillow aside. His hands ran down his face; he really needed to wash his hair. Slinging his legs over the couch, he managed to get himself up and to the door. And once he opened it, he felt every part of his body jolt awake.</p><p>\u201cWalker!\u201d he cried, reaching forward and pulling him into a hug, \u201cGod, I missed you so much,\u201d he whispered into the other boy\u2019s shirt, clutching it tightly.</p><p>\u201cI missed you too,\u201d the other boy replied, quick to drop his bags and wrap his arms around Jonah, \u201chow was life here?\u201d</p><p>Jonah pulled back, shrugging. \u201cUneventful. Boring without you,\u201d he admitted, taking his bag and ushering him inside, \u201chow was Florida?\u201d</p><p>Walker rubbed his head, melting into the couch with a contented sigh. \u201cIt was alright. Nice to see relatives gush about how much I\u2019d grown. And meanwhile I\u2019m here like \u2018I\u2019m just going to hug this person I don\u2019t know\u2019,\u201d he chuckled, putting his feet up.</p><p>\u201cI know that feeling. That\u2019s what Easter is like when my mom hosts it,\u201d he shuddered, \u201cthe great Easter of \u201808 has still not left our minds,\u201d he added, \u201chow was the 4th of July down there?\u201d</p><p>Walker nearly rolled his eyes, pulling a pillow into his chest, his eyelids drooping down. \u201cLoud. Bright. A little overwhelming. I kinda wish you were there,\u201d</p><p>Jonah smirked, taking the boy\u2019s hand. \u201cOnly kinda?\u201d</p><p>Walker didn\u2019t have the energy to argue with him, so he just tugged him a little closer. \u201cShh,\u201d he hummed, \u201cI\u2019m tired, I just wanna sleep,\u201d</p><p>Jonah shook his head, his hair gently brushing the other. \u201cFine. But when you wake up, you better tell me more about all the fun you had without me,\u201d</p><p>Walker breathed out a laugh, shutting his eyes. \u201cYou mean like all the pretty girls I saw?\u201d</p><p>Jonah stuck his tongue out in response. \u201cDork,\u201d he mumbled, and when no response came, he knew Walker was probably asleep.</p><hr><p>\u201cI miss you so much Cyrus,\u201d TJ murmured, leaning against the sink. The bright lights made him squint at the other boy on the other side of the screen, but he wouldn\u2019t have it any other way.</p><p>\u201cI miss you too,\u201d he whispered, careful to not wake Andi and Buffy, who had fallen asleep recently, \u201cI just wanna give you a hug. How\u2019s the vacation going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really happy it\u2019s almost over,\u201d he admitted softly, \u201cit\u2019s been really\u2026awkward,\u201d</p><p>Cyrus frowned; he wanted nothing more than to just reach through the screen and plant a soft kiss on TJ\u2019s forehead. Unfortunately, technology hadn\u2019t advanced that far yet. \u201cHow\u2019s your mom been?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s <i>been </i>ignoring me,\u201d he huffed, pouting, \u201cwhich I guess it better than her saying hurtful things. But I wish she\u2019d just treat me like she used to,\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you really soon, though. And then we\u2019ll get to hang out, just you and me. I love you,\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove you too,\u201d he murmured, shutting off the video chat, and slipping his phone into his pocket. It physically hurt him to be away from Cyrus for such a long time, but it was only for another day. He was getting back tomorrow; and the only people that knew were his mom and Amber, obviously, and Leslie. He\u2019d made sure to tell her to not say a work to Cyrus, and he was fairly certain that his plan had worked. He couldn\u2019t wait to see the look on Cyrus\u2019 face.</p><p>Crawling out of the bathroom he snuck into the bed with Amber, trying not to shake her awake.</p><p>\u201cTalking to Cyrus?\u201d she whispered, turning to face him.</p><p>He nodded, tugging the covers up to his neck. \u201cI miss him,\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll see him tomorrow,\u201d she reminded him, \u201cgood night,\u201d she turned onto her other side, tugging the covers a little closer to her.</p><p>\u201cNight,\u201d</p><p>Tag List: \n<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m7R6p_iU9G8Gh8chz1LUkOg\">@shortstackofpeaches || @seanna313</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mB_fjwbYnt6KH-iEEVWn8ig\">@geekingbeautytx</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mx3fTvftLAxW_PMMErDl_UA\">@heavenlybyers ||</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mr1BeThlMP6lSNdCv9_u98w\">@ginnychrises</a>|| <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mq4Fz3LkzWjZC-KqvwLI2IQ\">@wlwandimack</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mlcQ2RsNl23FLSXFuHW7LHA\">@giocondasstuff</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjInWsj0ClAwVBAeG3vRcVw\">@lemonboytyrus</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mNwMw7enpLkLc8PJbIgqIpA\">@adorejrizzle</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mqsacC6O0CwDxqCVXhKqKMg\">@swingsetboys</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m5HZenndZxervK_R1eUWPgA\">@ifellintotyrushell</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mlmDXY_IPGUhgMI0icEk5Fw\">@idk-dude-17</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/md3vq8Jj9kFqSljYsARejoQ\">@rbf-lesbian</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/miY4DTLwRG38LWUEXGrwqQQ\">@marianara-sauce</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mweSXXIeqHwnjzlxWq9XUDw\">@kaptainjinxz</a> || @<a href=\"http://alex-poster-pizz.tumblr.com\">alex-poster-pizz || </a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mPGweOqhfiAqow-tS0I2R6Q\">@quietmarvel</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mdvU81fYq0CNQvV5m2taDGQ\">@blueberry-my-hero-macadamia</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mcbji5TcL-VC-WOCJVAbpjw\">@broadwayitbitch</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mIrWwvtK767VFgc84SQnSmw\">@tjsmuffin</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mNxJK8EhlLcuAxp-Fy8ZbFA\">@tjthekippen</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mD5xwG2u8vIh_s73zuIGl0g\">@idpleasesir</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m7fdykeIYkcOXPu3bLUwexA\">@hi-hello-hey-there</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/miDxY6dUJGULGFxiGQ40Vzw\">@bingewatchingenthusiast</a>|| <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_McecsKdTsnfdqnR2ozw1A\">@booklove-2</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m3KYGYYNAKvqZ_XVFoSWXCg\">@illbeyourreasonwhy</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mEx0042yZEiHRJ3jMqTs-rA\">@birdiesandflowers</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m8CXsQC7iejVYW39YZtzCUg\">@whistlepunk</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m9sonAr6Kx-g7fLYWOoIENQ\">@phinallyjackie</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrTO_xWDLkyEgi4LFyByJMQ\">@thedampjofangirl</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mxUprLHny1HYleRX2Qz3B-Q\">@tyrus4eva</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mDtn4v-rJcfP7a0m51rQAIA\">@tj-is-a-lemony-boy</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mAvcCAzWMuhg5NFzViiC1Uw\">@tj-goodman-bittersweet-boy</a> || @dis-app-oin-tme-nt || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m6_PSslGMLadBwFf51HMVMw\">@nessarinthegay</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m2S891zBEolQhmvw94WEEpA\">@breadisticks</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYctS-TJVaIxMIM1KPeVP1A\">@typewriter-riz</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mpDM4OrcSo5OknyNg-7VgWg\">@gobletofash</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mgjuE9tqgzdBFlw3OUmAPYg\">@bluemuffinboy</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/myeSqX7QQrz4q4ZteKbmoCg\">@sofuuh</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mKemMX29wu_Y_MCi69LuIMQ\">@cheesystars</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfAL43lCQk6VEqq6AxC6GeQ\">@tjmuffin</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m-26HuYTBll7Hj1BqcsOZPA\">@multifandom-bxitch</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/muYk4KP0O5cWwKw3iozZ6nA\">@allylovessadie</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mCc7FcCPMxCd8PrWuydEr4w\">@hithatsmyname</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mFA7rW6-u7x3w8VNCK_KD7A\">@tyrusinarush</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mFMeKUhkzTWE7ubZ8HduqJA\">@tyrus-lookback</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mhwpAw_kQmNajYckySCFqAg\">@gaycefulwords</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/meUWCp5upJMOnRbGLOzvcxw\">@theobligatedklutz</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m3EOu5JFaQ22e0aezi7yabw\">@bambikippen</a> ||\n\n<br></p></p>",

But with TJ, he seems \nto be at a loss for words. When they get paired up for a summer \nassignment, Cyrus slowly starts to build a new dictionary. One that \ninvolves TJ and everything they do together. Along the way, maybe he\u2019ll \nfind the words to tell him how he feels.</p><p><b>Chapter 17: </b>Saudade<br></p><p><b>Word Count: </b>2252</p><p><i>Read on AO3</i><br></p><hr><p>Two weeks. <i>Two weeks</i>.</p><p>It might as well have been two years, Cyrus assumed. TJ had been on vacation for two weeks (thirteen days to be more exact), and Cyrus had never missed anyone more. He knew that TJ wasn\u2019t gone, per se, but he missed him; he missed running his hands through his hair, holding hands and falling asleep next to him, kissing him until he felt like he couldn\u2019t breathe.</p><p><i>saudade: missing someone so much that it physically hurts</i></p><p>To try and distract himself, he hung out with Buffy as much as he could, considering he couldn\u2019t go to Andi.</p><p>\u201cYou have to talk to her,\u201d Buffy mumbled into the phone.</p><p>\u201cWhat if she hates me? It\u2019s been a long time,\u201d he worried, pacing around his small room.</p><p>\u201cCyrus, Andi loves you. You know she wouldn\u2019t stay mad at you forever. She really cares about you,\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate it when you\u2019re right,\u201d he grumbled, hanging up and grabbing a pair of shoes.</p><hr>[[MORE]]<p>It felt oddly chilly outside, considering Cyrus had to rub his biceps furiously as he walked to Andi\u2019s house. The closer he got, it appeared, the harder it was to move his legs forward. It was as if he was being held back by cement.</p><p><i>Step</i>.</p><p>Everything was going to be okay, right? Buffy was usually right, so why shouldn\u2019t he believed her now?</p><p><i>Step</i>.</p><p>Nope, bad idea, bad idea. Why not just give up now? What\u2019s one less friend.</p><p><i>Step.</i></p><p>No, he could do this. Things were going to be okay; they were going to sort things out.</p><p>He knocked twice, albeit shakily, and waited. And waited. And waited. Maybe this was a bad idea. Maybe Andi really didn\u2019t want to talk to him and was purposely avoiding him. Or\u2026maybe she just wasn\u2019t home. Or maybe-</p><p>Before he could finish that thought, the door swung open. And it looked like Andi was almost smiling, but the moment she saw Cyrus, her face fell.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d she murmured, staring down at her feet. She dug her toes into the carpet, trying to distract herself.</p><p>\u201cCan I come in?\u201d</p><p>She nodded weakly, stepping aside for him. Cyrus slipped his shoes off, and she nodded up the stairs, Cyrus following behind her. It felt like he hadn\u2019t been up here in ages. He\u2019d missed having sleepovers with her and Buffy; they had mostly stopped once they\u2019d entered high school because they just didn\u2019t have time anymore.</p><p>The moment that they sat on the bed, the words flowed out quickly, as if they were held back by a dam.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I yelled at you,\u201d he began, \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to be so rude, I\u2019m so sorry, Andi. I just\u2026when you were talking about me and TJ, I just thought it was something so outlandish,\u201d</p><p>Andi nodded silently, breathing out softly. \u201cSorry for meddling,\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be apologizing, I should. And I\u2019m sorry,\u201d he murmured, putting his hand on Andi\u2019s shoulder. Her lips twitched up into a hesitant smile, the tension in the room easing up a little. She pulled him in for a hug, and there they stayed for a little while.</p><p>\u201cPlus you were right,\u201d Cyrus added, an impish grin gracing his face, \u201cabout me and TJ,\u201d</p><p>Her whole face lit up, clapping her hands in excitement. \u201cCyrus!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, how\u2019s it been with you two? Tell me <i>everything</i>,\u201d she insisted, propping her head up with her elbows, and batting her lashes.</p><p>Cyrus shrugged, but the smile on his face spoke for itself. \u201cIt\u2019s been great,\u201d he admitted, flopping back onto her bed and staring at the ceiling, \u201cI miss him though. He\u2019s been on vacation for almost two weeks. But he comes back in two days,\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you worried? About\u2026him spending time with his mom?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus nodded, tracing over the seams of Andi\u2019s bedsheets. \u201cYeah,\u201d he said, his voice timid and nervous, \u201cI just hope he\u2019s okay,\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe will be. He\u2019s strong,\u201d she reminded him, placing a hand on his head, \u201cokay, no more sad talk. We should do something fun, you, me, and Buffy. I feel like we haven\u2019t hung out all summer,\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about a sleepover, like the kind we used to have in middle school?\u201d Cyrus suggested, \u201cI miss those,\u201d</p><p><b>the ghc</b></p><p><b>[andi: sleepover today? my house]</b></p><p><b>[buffy: can\u2019t wait, i\u2019ve missed things like this &lt;3]</b></p><p>\u201cBuffy\u2019s in. So\u2026movies and junk food until we pass out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have it any other way,\u201d</p><hr><p>It was hot. Too hot. There was a reason TJ didn\u2019t like the beach; there was too much sand, the sun was never hidden, and the squacks of seagulls was anything but peaceful. How people could fall asleep, he had no idea. Not even his sunglasses helped him from squinting in order to not be blinded.</p><p>Amber seemed to have no problem with the beach; she loved the way the sun lightened her hair, the way the ocean breeze kissed every inch of her skin, the comfort in knowing she could simply lie down and do nothing.</p><p>\u201cDo you miss him?\u201d she asked, dragging her fingers through the sand.</p><p>Amber really could read his thoughts, couldn\u2019t she. \u201cYeah,\u201d he mumbled, \u201ca lot. I just wanna go home,\u201d he grumbled, staring off into the distance, where his mom was chatting with a group of ladies.</p><p>Amber scooted her chair closer putting a hand on her brother\u2019s arm. \u201c\u2026I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll come around, TJ,\u201d she promised, watching as their mother mingled like she was at a party.</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, I\u2019m not so sure,\u201d he huffed, squirming under her touch, \u201cshe\u2019s barely said a word to either of us this entire trip. I mean, at least she talks to you a <i>little</i>, but she hasn\u2019t said anything to me,\u201d</p><p>Amber forced herself to not be irked by his movement. \u201cJust two more years and then you get to go to college,\u201d she tried, offering a sympathetic smile, \u201cguys like you are gonna be cool in college,\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t remind me,\u201d he groaned, putting his hands over his face, \u201cCyrus is going to go to some Ivy League on the other side of the coast, and I\u2019m going to go to some rinky-dink community college ten minutes from here,\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, don\u2019t say that,\u201d she pressed, pushing her sunglasses further up the bridge of her nose, \u201cyou could get a basketball scholarship,\u201d</p><p>TJ scoffed, shaking his head at the very idea. Sure, he loved basketball and yeah, he was pretty decent at it, but pretty decent wasn\u2019t going to peak the scouts\u2019 interests. \u201cIf I\u2019m lucky. I just don\u2019t want to think about going to college and having to\u2026\u201d he trailed, the words unable to come out.</p><p>\u201c\u2026break up with him?\u201d Amber finished for him.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he whispered, so softly that Amber nearly didn\u2019t hear him. Ah, the lovely feeling of vulnerability.</p><p>Amber felt a little guilty for bringing it up, a gnawing feeling in her stomach. \u201cHey,\u201d she gave his hand a squeeze, \u201cthat\u2019s a while from now. Live in the moment, right? Things are okay now,\u201d</p><p>TJ smiled, tilting his head back. \u201cYeah, things are okay,\u201d</p><hr><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve already seen Mulan a thousand times,\u201d Cyrus whined, leaning back against the couch and pulling his blanket up to his neck.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the best Disney movie,\u201d Buffy argued, selecting the movie while ignoring Cyrus\u2019 pleas.</p><p>\u201cHm, I think Beauty and the Beast begs to differ, but whatever,\u201d Andi mumbled, poking Buffy\u2019s side. It was harder now for them all to fit on the couch now that they had grown (now that Buffy and Andi had growth spurts, more specifically), but they didn\u2019t mind being pushed together. It was just like old times; movies, chip crumbs littering the couch cushions, and more blankets than were probably safe.</p><p>Cyrus barely paid attention to the movie. He spend most of the time checking his phone for any new texts. Andi and Buffy picked up on this, giving each other knowing looks.</p><p>\u201cTJ?\u201d they asked.</p><p>Cyrus felt his face burn, tucking his phone in his pocket. \u201cNo,\u201d he lied, \u201cnot\u2026really, at least. He hasn\u2019t texted me,\u201d</p><p>Buffy\u2019s face softened, placing a hand on his arm. \u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019s just busy spending time with his mom and Amber,\u201d she soothed, \u201che\u2019ll text you when he can,\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you heard from Amber?\u201d Cyrus asked, turning to Andi.</p><p>\u201cA little,\u201d she admitted, \u201cshe said that their mom is trying to keep them occupied with things to do. She mostly just texts me before bed,\u201d</p><p>Cyrus nodded, feeling a bit more relieved. \u201cHow are things with you and Marty?\u201d</p><p>Buffy smirked, cracking her fingers. \u201cLet\u2019s just say that I haven\u2019t lost an arm wrestle,\u201d</p><p>Andi rolled her eyes, shaking her head. \u201cYou and only you would say that when someone asks you about your relationship,\u201d</p><p>Buffy chuckled, tossing a pillow at her. \u201cOh, hush, you. You\u2019re just jealous that me and Marty make a cuter couple than you and Amber,\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not jealous, because that\u2019s completely false,\u201d she countered, crossing her arms.</p><p>\u201cI think we\u2019re forgetting the point of this sleepover,\u201d Cyrus mumbled, smiling mischievously, \u201cthat <i>TJ and I</i> are the cutest couple,\u201d he insisted, turning up the TV loud enough so that he didn\u2019t hear Andi and Buffy coo over his affection for the other boy.</p><hr><p><i>\u201c\u2026previously on Worst Cooks in America,\u201d</i></p><p>Jonah grumbled, grabbing a pillow and holding it to his chest. Maybe trying to binge two seasons of the show within two days was a mistake. His eyes burned every time he blinked, he was fairly certain he hadn\u2019t drank water for two days, and he was still in the same clothes.</p><p>Then came a knock at the door, and he tossed his pillow aside. His hands ran down his face; he really needed to wash his hair. Slinging his legs over the couch, he managed to get himself up and to the door. And once he opened it, he felt every part of his body jolt awake.</p><p>\u201cWalker!\u201d he cried, reaching forward and pulling him into a hug, \u201cGod, I missed you so much,\u201d he whispered into the other boy\u2019s shirt, clutching it tightly.</p><p>\u201cI missed you too,\u201d the other boy replied, quick to drop his bags and wrap his arms around Jonah, \u201chow was life here?\u201d</p><p>Jonah pulled back, shrugging. \u201cUneventful. Boring without you,\u201d he admitted, taking his bag and ushering him inside, \u201chow was Florida?\u201d</p><p>Walker rubbed his head, melting into the couch with a contented sigh. \u201cIt was alright. Nice to see relatives gush about how much I\u2019d grown. And meanwhile I\u2019m here like \u2018I\u2019m just going to hug this person I don\u2019t know\u2019,\u201d he chuckled, putting his feet up.</p><p>\u201cI know that feeling. That\u2019s what Easter is like when my mom hosts it,\u201d he shuddered, \u201cthe great Easter of \u201808 has still not left our minds,\u201d he added, \u201chow was the 4th of July down there?\u201d</p><p>Walker nearly rolled his eyes, pulling a pillow into his chest, his eyelids drooping down. \u201cLoud. Bright. A little overwhelming. I kinda wish you were there,\u201d</p><p>Jonah smirked, taking the boy\u2019s hand. \u201cOnly kinda?\u201d</p><p>Walker didn\u2019t have the energy to argue with him, so he just tugged him a little closer. \u201cShh,\u201d he hummed, \u201cI\u2019m tired, I just wanna sleep,\u201d</p><p>Jonah shook his head, his hair gently brushing the other. \u201cFine. But when you wake up, you better tell me more about all the fun you had without me,\u201d</p><p>Walker breathed out a laugh, shutting his eyes. \u201cYou mean like all the pretty girls I saw?\u201d</p><p>Jonah stuck his tongue out in response. \u201cDork,\u201d he mumbled, and when no response came, he knew Walker was probably asleep.</p><hr><p>\u201cI miss you so much Cyrus,\u201d TJ murmured, leaning against the sink. The bright lights made him squint at the other boy on the other side of the screen, but he wouldn\u2019t have it any other way.</p><p>\u201cI miss you too,\u201d he whispered, careful to not wake Andi and Buffy, who had fallen asleep recently, \u201cI just wanna give you a hug. How\u2019s the vacation going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really happy it\u2019s almost over,\u201d he admitted softly, \u201cit\u2019s been really\u2026awkward,\u201d</p><p>Cyrus frowned; he wanted nothing more than to just reach through the screen and plant a soft kiss on TJ\u2019s forehead. Unfortunately, technology hadn\u2019t advanced that far yet. \u201cHow\u2019s your mom been?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s <i>been </i>ignoring me,\u201d he huffed, pouting, \u201cwhich I guess it better than her saying hurtful things. But I wish she\u2019d just treat me like she used to,\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you really soon, though. And then we\u2019ll get to hang out, just you and me. I love you,\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove you too,\u201d he murmured, shutting off the video chat, and slipping his phone into his pocket. It physically hurt him to be away from Cyrus for such a long time, but it was only for another day.

But with TJ, he seems \nto be at a loss for words. When they get paired up for a summer \nassignment, Cyrus slowly starts to build a new dictionary. One that \ninvolves TJ and everything they do together. Along the way, maybe he&rsquo;ll \nfind the words to tell him how he feels.</p><p><b>Chapter 17: </b>Saudade<br /></p><p><b>Word Count: </b>2252</p><p><i>Read on AO3</i><br /></p><hr /><p>Two weeks. <i>Two weeks</i>.</p><p>It might as well have been two years, Cyrus assumed. TJ had been on vacation for two weeks (thirteen days to be more exact), and Cyrus had never missed anyone more. He knew that TJ wasn&rsquo;t gone, per se, but he missed him; he missed running his hands through his hair, holding hands and falling asleep next to him, kissing him until he felt like he couldn&rsquo;t breathe.</p><p><i>saudade: missing someone so much that it physically hurts</i></p><p>To try and distract himself, he hung out with Buffy as much as he could, considering he couldn&rsquo;t go to Andi.</p><p>&ldquo;You have to talk to her,&rdquo; Buffy mumbled into the phone.</p><p>&ldquo;What if she hates me? It&rsquo;s been a long time,&rdquo; he worried, pacing around his small room.</p><p>&ldquo;Cyrus, Andi loves you. You know she wouldn&rsquo;t stay mad at you forever. She really cares about you,&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I hate it when you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; he grumbled, hanging up and grabbing a pair of shoes.</p><hr /><p>It felt oddly chilly outside, considering Cyrus had to rub his biceps furiously as he walked to Andi&rsquo;s house. The closer he got, it appeared, the harder it was to move his legs forward. It was as if he was being held back by cement.</p><p><i>Step</i>.</p><p>Everything was going to be okay, right? Buffy was usually right, so why shouldn&rsquo;t he believed her now?</p><p><i>Step</i>.</p><p>Nope, bad idea, bad idea. Why not just give up now? What&rsquo;s one less friend.</p><p><i>Step.</i></p><p>No, he could do this. Things were going to be okay; they were going to sort things out.</p><p>He knocked twice, albeit shakily, and waited. And waited. And waited. Maybe this was a bad idea. Maybe Andi really didn&rsquo;t want to talk to him and was purposely avoiding him. Or&hellip;maybe she just wasn&rsquo;t home. Or maybe-</p><p>Before he could finish that thought, the door swung open. And it looked like Andi was almost smiling, but the moment she saw Cyrus, her face fell.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey,&rdquo; she murmured, staring down at her feet. She dug her toes into the carpet, trying to distract herself.</p><p>&ldquo;Can I come in?&rdquo;</p><p>She nodded weakly, stepping aside for him. Cyrus slipped his shoes off, and she nodded up the stairs, Cyrus following behind her. It felt like he hadn&rsquo;t been up here in ages. He&rsquo;d missed having sleepovers with her and Buffy; they had mostly stopped once they&rsquo;d entered high school because they just didn&rsquo;t have time anymore.</p><p>The moment that they sat on the bed, the words flowed out quickly, as if they were held back by a dam.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry I yelled at you,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to be so rude, I&rsquo;m so sorry, Andi. I just&hellip;when you were talking about me and TJ, I just thought it was something so outlandish,&rdquo;</p><p>Andi nodded silently, breathing out softly. &ldquo;Sorry for meddling,&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t be apologizing, I should. And I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; he murmured, putting his hand on Andi&rsquo;s shoulder. Her lips twitched up into a hesitant smile, the tension in the room easing up a little. She pulled him in for a hug, and there they stayed for a little while.</p><p>&ldquo;Plus you were right,&rdquo; Cyrus added, an impish grin gracing his face, &ldquo;about me and TJ,&rdquo;</p><p>Her whole face lit up, clapping her hands in excitement. &ldquo;Cyrus!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hi,&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So, how&rsquo;s it been with you two? Tell me <i>everything</i>,&rdquo; she insisted, propping her head up with her elbows, and batting her lashes.</p><p>Cyrus shrugged, but the smile on his face spoke for itself. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been great,&rdquo; he admitted, flopping back onto her bed and staring at the ceiling, &ldquo;I miss him though. He&rsquo;s been on vacation for almost two weeks. But he comes back in two days,&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Are you worried? About&hellip;him spending time with his mom?&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus nodded, tracing over the seams of Andi&rsquo;s bedsheets. &ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; he said, his voice timid and nervous, &ldquo;I just hope he&rsquo;s okay,&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He will be. He&rsquo;s strong,&rdquo; she reminded him, placing a hand on his head, &ldquo;okay, no more sad talk. We should do something fun, you, me, and Buffy. I feel like we haven&rsquo;t hung out all summer,&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How about a sleepover, like the kind we used to have in middle school?&rdquo; Cyrus suggested, &ldquo;I miss those,&rdquo;</p><p><b>the ghc</b></p><p><b>[andi: sleepover today? my house]</b></p><p><b>[buffy: can&rsquo;t wait, i&rsquo;ve missed things like this &lt;3]</b></p><p>&ldquo;Buffy&rsquo;s in. So&hellip;movies and junk food until we pass out?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t have it any other way,&rdquo;</p><hr /><p>It was hot. Too hot. There was a reason TJ didn&rsquo;t like the beach; there was too much sand, the sun was never hidden, and the squacks of seagulls was anything but peaceful. How people could fall asleep, he had no idea. Not even his sunglasses helped him from squinting in order to not be blinded.</p><p>Amber seemed to have no problem with the beach; she loved the way the sun lightened her hair, the way the ocean breeze kissed every inch of her skin, the comfort in knowing she could simply lie down and do nothing.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you miss him?&rdquo; she asked, dragging her fingers through the sand.</p><p>Amber really could read his thoughts, couldn&rsquo;t she. &ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; he mumbled, &ldquo;a lot. I just wanna go home,&rdquo; he grumbled, staring off into the distance, where his mom was chatting with a group of ladies.</p><p>Amber scooted her chair closer putting a hand on her brother&rsquo;s arm. &ldquo;&hellip;I&rsquo;m sure she&rsquo;ll come around, TJ,&rdquo; she promised, watching as their mother mingled like she was at a party.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, well, I&rsquo;m not so sure,&rdquo; he huffed, squirming under her touch, &ldquo;she&rsquo;s barely said a word to either of us this entire trip. I mean, at least she talks to you a <i>little</i>, but she hasn&rsquo;t said anything to me,&rdquo;</p><p>Amber forced herself to not be irked by his movement. &ldquo;Just two more years and then you get to go to college,&rdquo; she tried, offering a sympathetic smile, &ldquo;guys like you are gonna be cool in college,&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t remind me,&rdquo; he groaned, putting his hands over his face, &ldquo;Cyrus is going to go to some Ivy League on the other side of the coast, and I&rsquo;m going to go to some rinky-dink community college ten minutes from here,&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, don&rsquo;t say that,&rdquo; she pressed, pushing her sunglasses further up the bridge of her nose, &ldquo;you could get a basketball scholarship,&rdquo;</p><p>TJ scoffed, shaking his head at the very idea. Sure, he loved basketball and yeah, he was pretty decent at it, but pretty decent wasn&rsquo;t going to peak the scouts&rsquo; interests. &ldquo;If I&rsquo;m lucky. I just don&rsquo;t want to think about going to college and having to&hellip;&rdquo; he trailed, the words unable to come out.</p><p>&ldquo;&hellip;break up with him?&rdquo; Amber finished for him.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; he whispered, so softly that Amber nearly didn&rsquo;t hear him. Ah, the lovely feeling of vulnerability.</p><p>Amber felt a little guilty for bringing it up, a gnawing feeling in her stomach. &ldquo;Hey,&rdquo; she gave his hand a squeeze, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s a while from now. Live in the moment, right? Things are okay now,&rdquo;</p><p>TJ smiled, tilting his head back. &ldquo;Yeah, things are okay,&rdquo;</p><hr /><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve already seen Mulan a thousand times,&rdquo; Cyrus whined, leaning back against the couch and pulling his blanket up to his neck.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the best Disney movie,&rdquo; Buffy argued, selecting the movie while ignoring Cyrus&rsquo; pleas.</p><p>&ldquo;Hm, I think Beauty and the Beast begs to differ, but whatever,&rdquo; Andi mumbled, poking Buffy&rsquo;s side. It was harder now for them all to fit on the couch now that they had grown (now that Buffy and Andi had growth spurts, more specifically), but they didn&rsquo;t mind being pushed together. It was just like old times; movies, chip crumbs littering the couch cushions, and more blankets than were probably safe.</p><p>Cyrus barely paid attention to the movie. He spend most of the time checking his phone for any new texts. Andi and Buffy picked up on this, giving each other knowing looks.</p><p>&ldquo;TJ?&rdquo; they asked.</p><p>Cyrus felt his face burn, tucking his phone in his pocket. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he lied, &ldquo;not&hellip;really, at least. He hasn&rsquo;t texted me,&rdquo;</p><p>Buffy&rsquo;s face softened, placing a hand on his arm. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;s just busy spending time with his mom and Amber,&rdquo; she soothed, &ldquo;he&rsquo;ll text you when he can,&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Have you heard from Amber?&rdquo; Cyrus asked, turning to Andi.</p><p>&ldquo;A little,&rdquo; she admitted, &ldquo;she said that their mom is trying to keep them occupied with things to do. She mostly just texts me before bed,&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus nodded, feeling a bit more relieved. &ldquo;How are things with you and Marty?&rdquo;</p><p>Buffy smirked, cracking her fingers. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s just say that I haven&rsquo;t lost an arm wrestle,&rdquo;</p><p>Andi rolled her eyes, shaking her head. &ldquo;You and only you would say that when someone asks you about your relationship,&rdquo;</p><p>Buffy chuckled, tossing a pillow at her. &ldquo;Oh, hush, you. You&rsquo;re just jealous that me and Marty make a cuter couple than you and Amber,&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not jealous, because that&rsquo;s completely false,&rdquo; she countered, crossing her arms.</p><p>&ldquo;I think we&rsquo;re forgetting the point of this sleepover,&rdquo; Cyrus mumbled, smiling mischievously, &ldquo;that <i>TJ and I</i> are the cutest couple,&rdquo; he insisted, turning up the TV loud enough so that he didn&rsquo;t hear Andi and Buffy coo over his affection for the other boy.</p><hr /><p><i>&ldquo;&hellip;previously on Worst Cooks in America,&rdquo;</i></p><p>Jonah grumbled, grabbing a pillow and holding it to his chest. Maybe trying to binge two seasons of the show within two days was a mistake. His eyes burned every time he blinked, he was fairly certain he hadn&rsquo;t drank water for two days, and he was still in the same clothes.</p><p>Then came a knock at the door, and he tossed his pillow aside. His hands ran down his face; he really needed to wash his hair. Slinging his legs over the couch, he managed to get himself up and to the door. And once he opened it, he felt every part of his body jolt awake.</p><p>&ldquo;Walker!&rdquo; he cried, reaching forward and pulling him into a hug, &ldquo;God, I missed you so much,&rdquo; he whispered into the other boy&rsquo;s shirt, clutching it tightly.</p><p>&ldquo;I missed you too,&rdquo; the other boy replied, quick to drop his bags and wrap his arms around Jonah, &ldquo;how was life here?&rdquo;</p><p>Jonah pulled back, shrugging. &ldquo;Uneventful. Boring without you,&rdquo; he admitted, taking his bag and ushering him inside, &ldquo;how was Florida?&rdquo;</p><p>Walker rubbed his head, melting into the couch with a contented sigh. &ldquo;It was alright. Nice to see relatives gush about how much I&rsquo;d grown. And meanwhile I&rsquo;m here like &lsquo;I&rsquo;m just going to hug this person I don&rsquo;t know&rsquo;,&rdquo; he chuckled, putting his feet up.</p><p>&ldquo;I know that feeling. That&rsquo;s what Easter is like when my mom hosts it,&rdquo; he shuddered, &ldquo;the great Easter of &lsquo;08 has still not left our minds,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;how was the 4th of July down there?&rdquo;</p><p>Walker nearly rolled his eyes, pulling a pillow into his chest, his eyelids drooping down. &ldquo;Loud. Bright. A little overwhelming. I kinda wish you were there,&rdquo;</p><p>Jonah smirked, taking the boy&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;Only kinda?&rdquo;</p><p>Walker didn&rsquo;t have the energy to argue with him, so he just tugged him a little closer. &ldquo;Shh,&rdquo; he hummed, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m tired, I just wanna sleep,&rdquo;</p><p>Jonah shook his head, his hair gently brushing the other. &ldquo;Fine. But when you wake up, you better tell me more about all the fun you had without me,&rdquo;</p><p>Walker breathed out a laugh, shutting his eyes. &ldquo;You mean like all the pretty girls I saw?&rdquo;</p><p>Jonah stuck his tongue out in response. &ldquo;Dork,&rdquo; he mumbled, and when no response came, he knew Walker was probably asleep.</p><hr /><p>&ldquo;I miss you so much Cyrus,&rdquo; TJ murmured, leaning against the sink. The bright lights made him squint at the other boy on the other side of the screen, but he wouldn&rsquo;t have it any other way.</p><p>&ldquo;I miss you too,&rdquo; he whispered, careful to not wake Andi and Buffy, who had fallen asleep recently, &ldquo;I just wanna give you a hug. How&rsquo;s the vacation going?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m really happy it&rsquo;s almost over,&rdquo; he admitted softly, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s been really&hellip;awkward,&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus frowned; he wanted nothing more than to just reach through the screen and plant a soft kiss on TJ&rsquo;s forehead. Unfortunately, technology hadn&rsquo;t advanced that far yet. &ldquo;How&rsquo;s your mom been?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s <i>been </i>ignoring me,&rdquo; he huffed, pouting, &ldquo;which I guess it better than her saying hurtful things. But I wish she&rsquo;d just treat me like she used to,&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see you really soon, though. And then we&rsquo;ll get to hang out, just you and me. I love you,&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Love you too,&rdquo; he murmured, shutting off the video chat, and slipping his phone into his pocket. It physically hurt him to be away from Cyrus for such a long time, but it was only for another day.

But with TJ, he seems \nto be at a loss for words. When they get paired up for a summer \nassignment, Cyrus slowly starts to build a new dictionary. One that \ninvolves TJ and everything they do together. Along the way, maybe he&rsquo;ll \nfind the words to tell him how he feels.</p>\n<p><b>Chapter 17: </b>Saudade<br /></p>\n<p><b>Word Count: </b>2252</p>\n<p><i>Read on AO3</i><br /></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Two weeks. <i>Two weeks</i>.</p>\n<p>It might as well have been two years, Cyrus assumed. TJ had been on vacation for two weeks (thirteen days to be more exact), and Cyrus had never missed anyone more. He knew that TJ wasn&rsquo;t gone, per se, but he missed him; he missed running his hands through his hair, holding hands and falling asleep next to him, kissing him until he felt like he couldn&rsquo;t breathe.</p>\n<p><i>saudade: missing someone so much that it physically hurts</i></p>\n<p>To try and distract himself, he hung out with Buffy as much as he could, considering he couldn&rsquo;t go to Andi.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;You have to talk to her,&rdquo; Buffy mumbled into the phone.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;What if she hates me? It&rsquo;s been a long time,&rdquo; he worried, pacing around his small room.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Cyrus, Andi loves you. You know she wouldn&rsquo;t stay mad at you forever. She really cares about you,&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I hate it when you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; he grumbled, hanging up and grabbing a pair of shoes.</p>\n<hr />\n</p>",

Distant explosions \u2013 growing closer with every passing hour \u2013 rumbled the ground and filled the air with smoke, casting a permanent shadow over the earth. Everywhere, people were running and screaming, huddled into groups as they desperately dodged the devastation surrounding them, their cries for mercy merging into white noise that floated like falling ash from the heavens.<br/></p><p>Next to him, shrouded by an old coat they\u2019d stolen from a\u00a0rotting\u00a0corpse a few days ago, Cyrus stirred from his restless sleep. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d he asked, wiping his bleary eyes with the back of his hand. \u201cAre they getting closer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d TJ said, the lie sliding easily off his tongue. He kissed the younger boy\u2019s forehead \u2013 the sweat beading his skin leaving a salty taste on his lips \u2013 and tugged him closer, until his head was tucked comfortably beneath his chin. \u201cJust go back to sleep, baby. I\u2019ll wake you when it\u2019s time to head out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too loud.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know\u2026 But you\u2019ve gotta try. We need to keep up our strength, right?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus looked up at him, his chin resting on his chest. Up close, TJ could see the sickly pallor of his skin, the bruise-like smudges beneath his eyes adding to the skeletal effect. They\u2019d gone without food and water for almost three days, and TJ knew they weren\u2019t going to last much longer. Cyrus\u2019 sunken face was testament to that.</p><p>\u201cWhat about you?\u201d Cyrus whispered, his hands reaching up to cup TJ\u2019s cheeks, his thumbs tracing the sharpness of his bones. \u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you slept?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine \u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re dying, TJ. We both are.\u201d</p><p>He knew it was true, but hearing Cyrus say it added an extra layer of reality to the situation, their chances of survival suddenly seeming like a faraway fantasy. As if on cue, another explosion racked the small cabin they were hauled up in, shards of glass streaming through the broken window on the opposite side of the room. TJ instinctively shielded Cyrus\u2019 face with his arm, gritting his teeth as tiny flecks of glass peppered his skin.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d he asked, carefully shaking the glass off Cyrus\u2019 coat once the building had stopped trembling.</p><p>\u201cI think so,\u201d Cyrus said, but there were tears in his eyes. \u201cWhat about you? Are you hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about me.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus grabbed his hand, the tears rolling down his cheeks as he traced the criss-cross pattern of scars littering his skin. \u201cYou\u2019re bleeding,\u201d he said, his words catching on a sob. \u201cWe need to clean this up\u2026 We need \u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d TJ held his face in his hands and kissed his tears away. \u201cI\u2019ll be okay.\u201d</p><p><i>We won\u2019t be alive for much longer</i>, was what he really meant, but couldn\u2019t bear to\u00a0say out loud.\u00a0<i>In the morning, none of this will matter.</i></p><p>\u201cIt might get infected.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll figure it out tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTJ\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust go back to sleep, okay? It\u2019ll all be better when you wake up.\u201d</p><p>Understanding dawned on Cyrus\u2019 face, his brow furrowing with a mixture of confusion and denial. Before he could speak, TJ pulled him against his chest and soothed him with a kiss, the faint smell of death wafting from the coat as he draped it over their shoulders, gently rubbing warmth into the younger boy\u2019s body.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d Cyrus said, his fingers\u00a0wringing\u00a0the front of TJ\u2019s shirt as he urged himself not to cry. \u201cI love you so much.\u201d</p><p>TJ swallowed roughly, his eyes desperately blinking back tears of his own. \u201cI love you too, Underdog.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you afraid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, an easy smile softening his expression. After a beat of silence, he tilted Cyrus\u2019 face upwards and pressed a kiss to his lips, their noses bumping together. \u201cI\u2019ve got you, haven\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus nodded. \u201cAlways.\u201d</p><p>A gust of wind rushed through the broken window, thick with the scent of fire and blood, and TJ felt Cyrus shiver beneath him. It wouldn\u2019t be long now; he could feel his heartbeat quickening, his chest rising and falling at a rapid pace as the night grew colder, despite the orange heat tearing through the town around them. If an explosion reached them first, they\u2019d be lucky. At least it would be quick, painless. Nothing but a flash of light in the darkness, and it would all be over.</p><p>\u201cGet some sleep,\u201d he told Cyrus, his words starting to slur as fatigue washed over him, sinking its claws deep into his mind, the blissful promise of nothingness tempting him away from this broken world. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a big day ahead of us.\u201d</p><p>Tomorrow never came, of course. But that was okay. The last thing he ever saw was Cyrus\u2019 smiling face, and that was a pretty good sight to fall asleep to.</p>",

Distant explosions &ndash; growing closer with every passing hour &ndash; rumbled the ground and filled the air with smoke, casting a permanent shadow over the earth. Everywhere, people were running and screaming, huddled into groups as they desperately dodged the devastation surrounding them, their cries for mercy merging into white noise that floated like falling ash from the heavens.<br /></p><p>Next to him, shrouded by an old coat they&rsquo;d stolen from a&nbsp;rotting&nbsp;corpse a few days ago, Cyrus stirred from his restless sleep. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo; he asked, wiping his bleary eyes with the back of his hand. &ldquo;Are they getting closer?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; TJ said, the lie sliding easily off his tongue. He kissed the younger boy&rsquo;s forehead &ndash; the sweat beading his skin leaving a salty taste on his lips &ndash; and tugged him closer, until his head was tucked comfortably beneath his chin. &ldquo;Just go back to sleep, baby. I&rsquo;ll wake you when it&rsquo;s time to head out.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too loud.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know&hellip; But you&rsquo;ve gotta try. We need to keep up our strength, right?&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus looked up at him, his chin resting on his chest. Up close, TJ could see the sickly pallor of his skin, the bruise-like smudges beneath his eyes adding to the skeletal effect. They&rsquo;d gone without food and water for almost three days, and TJ knew they weren&rsquo;t going to last much longer. Cyrus&rsquo; sunken face was testament to that.</p><p>&ldquo;What about you?&rdquo; Cyrus whispered, his hands reaching up to cup TJ&rsquo;s cheeks, his thumbs tracing the sharpness of his bones. &ldquo;When&rsquo;s the last time you slept?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine &ndash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re dying, TJ. We both are.&rdquo;</p><p>He knew it was true, but hearing Cyrus say it added an extra layer of reality to the situation, their chances of survival suddenly seeming like a faraway fantasy. As if on cue, another explosion racked the small cabin they were hauled up in, shards of glass streaming through the broken window on the opposite side of the room. TJ instinctively shielded Cyrus&rsquo; face with his arm, gritting his teeth as tiny flecks of glass peppered his skin.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you okay?&rdquo; he asked, carefully shaking the glass off Cyrus&rsquo; coat once the building had stopped trembling.</p><p>&ldquo;I think so,&rdquo; Cyrus said, but there were tears in his eyes. &ldquo;What about you? Are you hurt?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about me.&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus grabbed his hand, the tears rolling down his cheeks as he traced the criss-cross pattern of scars littering his skin. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re bleeding,&rdquo; he said, his words catching on a sob. &ldquo;We need to clean this up&hellip; We need &ndash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine.&rdquo; TJ held his face in his hands and kissed his tears away. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be okay.&rdquo;</p><p><i>We won&rsquo;t be alive for much longer</i>, was what he really meant, but couldn&rsquo;t bear to&nbsp;say out loud.&nbsp;<i>In the morning, none of this will matter.</i></p><p>&ldquo;It might get infected.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll figure it out tomorrow.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;TJ&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Just go back to sleep, okay? It&rsquo;ll all be better when you wake up.&rdquo;</p><p>Understanding dawned on Cyrus&rsquo; face, his brow furrowing with a mixture of confusion and denial. Before he could speak, TJ pulled him against his chest and soothed him with a kiss, the faint smell of death wafting from the coat as he draped it over their shoulders, gently rubbing warmth into the younger boy&rsquo;s body.</p><p>&ldquo;I love you,&rdquo; Cyrus said, his fingers&nbsp;wringing&nbsp;the front of TJ&rsquo;s shirt as he urged himself not to cry. &ldquo;I love you so much.&rdquo;</p><p>TJ swallowed roughly, his eyes desperately blinking back tears of his own. &ldquo;I love you too, Underdog.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Are you afraid?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, an easy smile softening his expression. After a beat of silence, he tilted Cyrus&rsquo; face upwards and pressed a kiss to his lips, their noses bumping together. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got you, haven&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus nodded. &ldquo;Always.&rdquo;</p><p>A gust of wind rushed through the broken window, thick with the scent of fire and blood, and TJ felt Cyrus shiver beneath him. It wouldn&rsquo;t be long now; he could feel his heartbeat quickening, his chest rising and falling at a rapid pace as the night grew colder, despite the orange heat tearing through the town around them. If an explosion reached them first, they&rsquo;d be lucky. At least it would be quick, painless. Nothing but a flash of light in the darkness, and it would all be over.</p><p>&ldquo;Get some sleep,&rdquo; he told Cyrus, his words starting to slur as fatigue washed over him, sinking its claws deep into his mind, the blissful promise of nothingness tempting him away from this broken world. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got a big day ahead of us.&rdquo;</p><p>Tomorrow never came, of course. But that was okay. The last thing he ever saw was Cyrus&rsquo; smiling face, and that was a pretty good sight to fall asleep to.</p>",

My favorite non-Tyrus moment would definitely be Cyrus coming out to Buffy. As an lgbt person it meant a lot to me. Although I am not a gay male, I AM a bi female. When he said \u201cI\u2019m scaring me too\u201d My heart sank because that\u2019s exactly how I felt when I was Cyrus\u2019 age. I was scaring myself. So the coming out scene means a lot to me. I also love CeCe scenes because Lauren Tom is a Queen. </p>",
