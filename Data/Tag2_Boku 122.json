No. Mr. Aizawa does not smile. </p><p>\tPerched on the edge of his desk, swinging your legs, you watched the class of 1-A sit down in their respective desks and wait.</p><p>\tSilence.</p><p>\tAnd then the door slammed open as the real Mr. Aizawa strolled in. He did a double take when he saw you, but did not change his facial expression.</p><!-- more --><p>\t\u201cHello Class.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cMr. Aizawa!\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cHow!\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cWhat!?\u201d<br/>\t\u201cWho is this!?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cThis is highly irregular! As the student Representative, I say declare yourself now Impersonator!\u201d This was loudly spoken by a teenager wearing glasses, karate chopping his hands in the air to emphasis his point.</p><p>\tYou laughed, still keeping Mr. Aizawa\u2019s shape. His laugh coming out of your mouth, his voice when you spoke, \u201cMr. Aizawa knows who I am. I\u2019m joining your class.\u201d</p><p>\tA very familiar short green haired boy spoke up shyly from the back, \u201cBut School has already been going on for a month now.\u201d</p><p>\tYou nodded, \u201cI got in on recommendation but I couldn\u2019t get here till now. Coming from over in America is a real struggle.\u201d</p><p>\tThe room erupted into mutters as people took in what you were saying. You knew what they were wondering. Why would someone from America come to Japan? There were plenty good hero academies in America. You had your own reasons for coming to UA, but you wouldn\u2019t share them.</p><p>\t\u201c[Y/n]&hellip;could you please stop using your quirk&hellip;or did you bring eye drops for me?\u201d One of the real Mr. Aizawa\u2019s eyebrows rose.</p><p>\tYou smiled, \u201cI know you aren\u2019t going to use your erasure on me. But okay.\u201d You turned back to the students who were still staring at you in various degrees of confusion, admiration, and fear, \u201cPlease&hellip;take in mind that since I came from America&hellip;Where women can dress very differently&hellip;that I mean no offense by my outfit.\u201d</p><p>\tMr. Aizawa let out a long suffering sigh, \u201cWhere is your uniform [Y/n]?\u201d</p><p>\tYou turned, sheepish, \u201cI uh,\u201d You rubbed the back of your head, still as Mr. Aizawa, \u201cMight have lost it at customs earlier this week.\u201d</p><p>\tAnother long suffering sigh and a wave of his hands, \u201cReturn to normal and I\u2019ll have another student take you to the office to get a new one.\u201d</p><p>\tTaking a deep, calming breath, you let your quirk fade out. And stood before class 1-A in high rise denim shorts, a plaid shirt, and cowboy boots.</p><p>\t\u201cHoly!\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cJesus!\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cSorry!\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cIndecent!\u201d<br/>\t\u201cLook away Midoriya!\u201d</p><p>\tLooking over the sea of faces, you settled on one that wasn\u2019t participating in the shock fest, who actually looked&hellip;bored. A kid with peppermint hair. </p><p>\t\u201cI volunteer to take you to the office!\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cNo! I volunteer!\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cYou perves, let a fellow girl take her!\u201d</p><p>\tMr. Aizawa sighed and you couldn\u2019t stop the laugh, knowing what he would say.</p><p>\t\u201cI don\u2019t care, figure it out so that class can begin.\u201d He unrolled a yellow sleeping bag and you smirked.</p><p>\t\u201cLost the red one?\u201d You asked. </p><p>\tThe class stilled once more.</p><p>\t\u201cGet a uniform.\u201d</p><p>\tAnd he faced the wall so that you could no longer see his face.</p><p>\tSpinning on the heel of your boots, you began walking to the door, \u201cAlright, well I\u2019m off to find the office.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cWait!\u201d</p><p>\tThe voice startled you. Without looking back, you ran out of the room.</p><p>\tTurning a corner, you listened as footsteps followed.</p><p>\tYour memories forced you back to a time before everything&hellip;a time of innocence. Two young boys and a girl playing in a river together. Proclaiming that they each would become a hero one day.</p><p>\tYou hadn\u2019t realized it, but you were now on the floor, hyperventilating as the memories overpowered you.</p><p>\t\u201cHey&hellip;are you okay?\u201d That soft voice again. Still the same as it was all those years ago.</p><p>\tYou looked up at Izuku Midoriya&hellip;the same child who used to play with you and Kacchan&hellip;Katsuki Bakugou all those years ago.</p><p>\tYou saw the moment his eyes widened in recognition, \u201cMariko Ad-\u201d </p><p>\tYou jumped up, hand flying out to cover his mouth. He jumped and struggled, but your grip was strong.</p><p>\tSparing a glance to the hallways, making sure no one else was around, you tugged Izuku further into the shadows before releasing his mouth.</p><p>\tHe frowned at you, \u201cMariko, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d<br/>\tYou hissed, \u201cI\u2019m not Mar-\u201d You couldn\u2019t say the name, biting the inside of your cheek, you flinched and sighed, running a hand through your hair.</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019m \u00a0[Y/n]. That, \u201cYou spat out, \u201cother person is dead.\u201d</p><p>\tYou knew you were confusing the boy. </p><p>\t\u201cLook, Izuku&hellip;let\u2019s find somewhere else to talk. I\u2019ll&hellip;I\u2019ll explain everything.\u201d Shoulders sagging in defeat, you followed your old childhood friend to an empty classroom.</p><p>\tJumping, you sat on the desk across from the chair that Izuku sat in. He looked up at you, those big eyes waiting.</p><p>\tYou closed your eyes for a minute. Trying to calm the storm inside. The fibers of your being that were yelling at you to run away. That this was a mistake.</p><p>\t\u201cI see you finally developed a quirk. I\u2019m sorry I wasn\u2019t here when it showed. Did it happen right after..?\u201d </p><p>\tLooking at Izuku, you saw him fidget, and his eyes dart around. Narrowing your eyes, you knew something was up.</p><p>\tBut he didn\u2019t cave, \u201cYeah. It\u2019s strength, agility and mobility&hellip;and Well&hellip;you left before your quirk showed too.\u201d</p><p>\tYou groaned, pushing the palms of your hands into your eyes, \u201cI didn\u2019t leave!\u201d</p><p>\tThat came out harsher than you planned.</p><p>\tTaking a deep breathe, you lowered your hands and opened them pleadingly to the tense boy, \u201cI didn\u2019t leave.\u201d You repeated, softer this time.</p><p>\tIzuku leaned forward, confusion all over his face, \u201cWhat do you mean? One minute, you were next door and the next minute, you were gone. No one knew where you or your parents were. But none of the police were concerned, saying that it was all official business and that there was nothing to worry about.\u201d</p><p>\tYou let out a short sarcastic bark of laughter, \u201cOf course they did. They couldn\u2019t have it be known that two of the cities finest citizen quirk users were brutally slaughtered in their own home.\u201d</p><p>\tA horrified gasp.</p><p>\tYour eyes were staring at Izuku, but were unfocused..seeing the past. Your folks both had powerful quirks, but they never went pro. Choosing instead to follow business jobs and staying at home to raise you.</p><p>\tUntil that day you came home from a day of playing with Izuku and Katsuki, excited to show your parents the quirk that had showed itself on your way home and found..</p><p>\tYou shuddered, bringing yourself back to the present, you hung your head, staring at the ground, \u201cI still have nightmares. I\u2019ll spare you the details of what I stumbled upon at five years old.\u201d</p><p>\tA cold hand grabbed yours, \u201cMari&hellip;I mean [Y/n]&hellip;I had no idea. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>\tYou laughed again, a bitter sound, \u201cYeah. Everyone was so damn sorry. The police officers, the case workers, the mayor. Everyone was so damn sorry but they did nothing. Those villains got away with killing innocent people and no one gave a damn.\u201d</p><p>\tYou were getting heated. Standing up, you began pacing at the front of the empty classroom.</p><p>\t\u201cBut what happened? Why did you disappear?\u201d Izuku muttered, more to himself than you.</p><p>\tYou answered, your voice growing thick and emotional, \u201cA few days after, I was stuck at the police precinct&hellip;they didn\u2019t want anyone to get wind of the murders&hellip;they knew it would only cause panic and chaos. That was how Shota Aizawa found me.\u201d</p><p>\tYou paused your pacing for a moment, before starting up again.</p><p>\tIzuku leaned back, stunned, \u201cYou met Mr. Aizawa when he was still doing Hero work?\u201d Obvious Awe in his voice.</p><p>\tYou smiled softly, he was still the same five year old nerd you remembered.</p><p>\t\u201cHe was bringing in some low level thugs when he saw me crying in an interrogation room that was being used as a temporary room for me. He came in and talked to me, calmed me down. He showed up everyday for a week before he finally decided to talk to an official about my situation. When he learned that I had no relatives and nobody knew what to do with me, he decided to take custody of me.\u201d</p><p>\tIzuku gasped, \u201cSo you\u2019re technically..\u201d </p><p>\tYou walked back to the desk he sat in, perching on the edge, you smiled again, \u201cYeah I\u2019m technically his kid. At least, according to the courts. He adopted me. I thought he would keep me with him. But..\u201d You trailed off again.</p><p>\tNow that Izuku had gotten you talking, it actually felt good to get this all off your chest.</p><p>\t\u201cHe said his line of work was too dangerous. So he sent me to New York where a friend lived.\u201d</p><p>\tIzuku snorted, before realizing what he had done and promptly covering his mouth with his hands, his face turning red.</p><p>\tYou snorted after, \u201cIt\u2019s okay. I know it doesn\u2019t seem like Shota has friends. But he does&hellip;did..anyways. Back when he was still Eraserhead. I grew up in New York\u2026.until I was old enough to apply for UA. Shota told me not to. He kept in contact all these years, but I am determined. I\u2019m going to become a hero and I\u2019m going to find the villains that killed them.\u201d</p><p>\tIzuku\u2019s coloring gradually returned to normal and he looked at you concerned, \u201c[Y/n]&hellip;revenge isn\u2019t something you should go after. A hero can\u2019t use their quirks outside government regulations and certainly not for personal justice. You know this.\u201d He tilted his head, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you keep in contact with me or kacchan?\u201d He sounded hurt.</p><p>\tYou gently ruffled his hair, \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I was just five. Scared. Hurt. In a new country.

As the student Representative, I say declare yourself now Impersonator!\u201d This was loudly spoken by a teenager wearing glasses, karate chopping his hands in the air to emphasis his point.</p><p>\tYou laughed, still keeping Mr. Aizawa\u2019s shape. His laugh coming out of your mouth, his voice when you spoke, \u201cMr. Aizawa knows who I am. I\u2019m joining your class.\u201d</p><p>\tA very familiar short green haired boy spoke up shyly from the back, \u201cBut School has already been going on for a month now.\u201d</p><p>\tYou nodded, \u201cI got in on recommendation but I couldn\u2019t get here till now. Coming from over in America is a real struggle.\u201d</p><p>\tThe room erupted into mutters as people took in what you were saying. You knew what they were wondering. Why would someone from America come to Japan? There were plenty good hero academies in America. You had your own reasons for coming to UA, but you wouldn\u2019t share them.</p><p>\t\u201c[Y/n]\u2026could you please stop using your quirk\u2026or did you bring eye drops for me?\u201d One of the real Mr. Aizawa\u2019s eyebrows rose.</p><p>\tYou smiled, \u201cI know you aren\u2019t going to use your erasure on me. But okay.\u201d You turned back to the students who were still staring at you in various degrees of confusion, admiration, and fear, \u201cPlease\u2026take in mind that since I came from America\u2026Where women can dress very differently\u2026that I mean no offense by my outfit.\u201d</p><p>\tMr. Aizawa let out a long suffering sigh, \u201cWhere is your uniform [Y/n]?\u201d</p><p>\tYou turned, sheepish, \u201cI uh,\u201d You rubbed the back of your head, still as Mr. Aizawa, \u201cMight have lost it at customs earlier this week.\u201d</p><p>\tAnother long suffering sigh and a wave of his hands, \u201cReturn to normal and I\u2019ll have another student take you to the office to get a new one.\u201d</p><p>\tTaking a deep, calming breath, you let your quirk fade out. And stood before class 1-A in high rise denim shorts, a plaid shirt, and cowboy boots.</p><p>\t\u201cHoly!\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cJesus!\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cSorry!\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cIndecent!\u201d<br>\t\u201cLook away Midoriya!\u201d</p><p>\tLooking over the sea of faces, you settled on one that wasn\u2019t participating in the shock fest, who actually looked\u2026bored. A kid with peppermint hair. </p><p>\t\u201cI volunteer to take you to the office!\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cNo! I volunteer!\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cYou perves, let a fellow girl take her!\u201d</p><p>\tMr. Aizawa sighed and you couldn\u2019t stop the laugh, knowing what he would say.</p><p>\t\u201cI don\u2019t care, figure it out so that class can begin.\u201d He unrolled a yellow sleeping bag and you smirked.</p><p>\t\u201cLost the red one?\u201d You asked. </p><p>\tThe class stilled once more.</p><p>\t\u201cGet a uniform.\u201d</p><p>\tAnd he faced the wall so that you could no longer see his face.</p><p>\tSpinning on the heel of your boots, you began walking to the door, \u201cAlright, well I\u2019m off to find the office.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cWait!\u201d</p><p>\tThe voice startled you. Without looking back, you ran out of the room.</p><p>\tTurning a corner, you listened as footsteps followed.</p><p>\tYour memories forced you back to a time before everything\u2026a time of innocence. Two young boys and a girl playing in a river together. Proclaiming that they each would become a hero one day.</p><p>\tYou hadn\u2019t realized it, but you were now on the floor, hyperventilating as the memories overpowered you.</p><p>\t\u201cHey\u2026are you okay?\u201d That soft voice again. Still the same as it was all those years ago.</p><p>\tYou looked up at Izuku Midoriya\u2026the same child who used to play with you and Kacchan\u2026Katsuki Bakugou all those years ago.</p><p>\tYou saw the moment his eyes widened in recognition, \u201cMariko Ad-\u201d </p><p>\tYou jumped up, hand flying out to cover his mouth. He jumped and struggled, but your grip was strong.</p><p>\tSparing a glance to the hallways, making sure no one else was around, you tugged Izuku further into the shadows before releasing his mouth.</p><p>\tHe frowned at you, \u201cMariko, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d<br>\tYou hissed, \u201cI\u2019m not Mar-\u201d You couldn\u2019t say the name, biting the inside of your cheek, you flinched and sighed, running a hand through your hair.</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019m \u00a0[Y/n]. That, \u201cYou spat out, \u201cother person is dead.\u201d</p><p>\tYou knew you were confusing the boy. </p><p>\t\u201cLook, Izuku\u2026let\u2019s find somewhere else to talk. I\u2019ll\u2026I\u2019ll explain everything.\u201d Shoulders sagging in defeat, you followed your old childhood friend to an empty classroom.</p><p>\tJumping, you sat on the desk across from the chair that Izuku sat in. He looked up at you, those big eyes waiting.</p><p>\tYou closed your eyes for a minute. Trying to calm the storm inside. The fibers of your being that were yelling at you to run away. That this was a mistake.</p><p>\t\u201cI see you finally developed a quirk. I\u2019m sorry I wasn\u2019t here when it showed. Did it happen right after..?\u201d </p><p>\tLooking at Izuku, you saw him fidget, and his eyes dart around. Narrowing your eyes, you knew something was up.</p><p>\tBut he didn\u2019t cave, \u201cYeah. It\u2019s strength, agility and mobility\u2026and Well\u2026you left before your quirk showed too.\u201d</p><p>\tYou groaned, pushing the palms of your hands into your eyes, \u201cI didn\u2019t leave!\u201d</p><p>\tThat came out harsher than you planned.</p><p>\tTaking a deep breathe, you lowered your hands and opened them pleadingly to the tense boy, \u201cI didn\u2019t leave.\u201d You repeated, softer this time.</p><p>\tIzuku leaned forward, confusion all over his face, \u201cWhat do you mean? One minute, you were next door and the next minute, you were gone. No one knew where you or your parents were. But none of the police were concerned, saying that it was all official business and that there was nothing to worry about.\u201d</p><p>\tYou let out a short sarcastic bark of laughter, \u201cOf course they did. They couldn\u2019t have it be known that two of the cities finest citizen quirk users were brutally slaughtered in their own home.\u201d</p><p>\tA horrified gasp.</p><p>\tYour eyes were staring at Izuku, but were unfocused..seeing the past. Your folks both had powerful quirks, but they never went pro. Choosing instead to follow business jobs and staying at home to raise you.</p><p>\tUntil that day you came home from a day of playing with Izuku and Katsuki, excited to show your parents the quirk that had showed itself on your way home and found..</p><p>\tYou shuddered, bringing yourself back to the present, you hung your head, staring at the ground, \u201cI still have nightmares. I\u2019ll spare you the details of what I stumbled upon at five years old.\u201d</p><p>\tA cold hand grabbed yours, \u201cMari\u2026I mean [Y/n]\u2026I had no idea. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>\tYou laughed again, a bitter sound, \u201cYeah. Everyone was so damn sorry. The police officers, the case workers, the mayor. Everyone was so damn sorry but they did nothing. Those villains got away with killing innocent people and no one gave a damn.\u201d</p><p>\tYou were getting heated. Standing up, you began pacing at the front of the empty classroom.</p><p>\t\u201cBut what happened? Why did you disappear?\u201d Izuku muttered, more to himself than you.</p><p>\tYou answered, your voice growing thick and emotional, \u201cA few days after, I was stuck at the police precinct\u2026they didn\u2019t want anyone to get wind of the murders\u2026they knew it would only cause panic and chaos. That was how Shota Aizawa found me.\u201d</p><p>\tYou paused your pacing for a moment, before starting up again.</p><p>\tIzuku leaned back, stunned, \u201cYou met Mr. Aizawa when he was still doing Hero work?\u201d Obvious Awe in his voice.</p><p>\tYou smiled softly, he was still the same five year old nerd you remembered.</p><p>\t\u201cHe was bringing in some low level thugs when he saw me crying in an interrogation room that was being used as a temporary room for me. He came in and talked to me, calmed me down. He showed up everyday for a week before he finally decided to talk to an official about my situation. When he learned that I had no relatives and nobody knew what to do with me, he decided to take custody of me.\u201d</p><p>\tIzuku gasped, \u201cSo you\u2019re technically..\u201d </p><p>\tYou walked back to the desk he sat in, perching on the edge, you smiled again, \u201cYeah I\u2019m technically his kid. At least, according to the courts. He adopted me. I thought he would keep me with him. But..\u201d You trailed off again.</p><p>\tNow that Izuku had gotten you talking, it actually felt good to get this all off your chest.</p><p>\t\u201cHe said his line of work was too dangerous. So he sent me to New York where a friend lived.\u201d</p><p>\tIzuku snorted, before realizing what he had done and promptly covering his mouth with his hands, his face turning red.</p><p>\tYou snorted after, \u201cIt\u2019s okay. I know it doesn\u2019t seem like Shota has friends. But he does\u2026did..anyways. Back when he was still Eraserhead. I grew up in New York\u2026.until I was old enough to apply for UA. Shota told me not to. He kept in contact all these years, but I am determined. I\u2019m going to become a hero and I\u2019m going to find the villains that killed them.\u201d</p><p>\tIzuku\u2019s coloring gradually returned to normal and he looked at you concerned, \u201c[Y/n]\u2026revenge isn\u2019t something you should go after. A hero can\u2019t use their quirks outside government regulations and certainly not for personal justice. You know this.\u201d He tilted his head, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you keep in contact with me or kacchan?\u201d He sounded hurt.</p><p>\tYou gently ruffled his hair, \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I was just five. Scared. Hurt. In a new country. By the time I thought about contacting you\u2026it had been a few years and I figured you both had moved on with your lives and I would just mess them up. That\u2019s why I was hoping neither of you recognized me.\u201d</p><p>\tIzuku laughed, \u201cI don\u2019t think Kacchan recognized you. I barely did with how you\u2019re dressed.\u201d He waved a hand at you, averting his eyes from your body, though his face still turned slightly red.</p><p>\tYou laughed, \u201cYeah. I got used to the customs in America. I need to remember how to behave in Japan.\u201d</p><p>\tIzuku sighed, \u201c[Y/n]\u2026you can\u2019t let this revenge cloud your vision or decide your future\u2026Why can\u2019t you just be Mariko?\u201d</p><p>\tYour eyes burned, you stood up again, towering over Izuku who for once looked terrified at you, \u201cMariko Adohira is dead! They died with their parents. I am Aizawa [Y/n] now and forever. I won\u2019t let those villains who killed my parents find me.\u201d</p><p>\tIzuku\u2019s terrified expression turned to one of intense thinking, \u201cYou think they will target you after ten years?\u201d</p><p>\tYou stood tall, staring out at nothing, but seeing the shadowy figures that haunted your nightmares, \u201cI don\u2019t know. But for now, I have the element of surprise and I\u2019m not losing it.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p><b></b></p><p><b>FOREVER Taglist:</b></p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mueqGDjNU-px9eazPTAiIaw\">@sxph-t</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m6JrH0mInv0_jJIQb7ThoRQ\">@mialeelavellan</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mezyjFsJ8KB5sI8HvSbv3Pg\">@rainydaysrnevergrey</a>\u00a0 <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mR_UCwARCul9gSnnNyDqpOQ\">@platonic-plots</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/maKNWOBDx1gFx-pwWIPIqLA\">@sociallyawkwardcircus-freak-hi</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mXMa1-Lg1MwHvfZ4eHrQ8Pg\">@ayyidkeither</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYmLRg0re4tEdiXOVlxPUfA\">@queenbbarnes</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mMa22YNJDzooYAhgSdAUaHA\">@mythixmagic</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mCCNAjP9ndzMFGDkgSK-_sw\">@chas-z</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mbgCK4NETm23uYtIEABN6-A\">@thefridgeismybestie</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mkPOqWgH7GCQm2YsvdXy7OQ\">@strangersstranger</a></p></p>",

His laugh coming out of your mouth, his voice when you spoke, \u201cMr. Aizawa knows who I am. I\u2019m joining your class.\u201d</p><p>\tA very familiar short green haired boy spoke up shyly from the back, \u201cBut School has already been going on for a month now.\u201d</p><p>\tYou nodded, \u201cI got in on recommendation but I couldn\u2019t get here till now. Coming from over in America is a real struggle.\u201d</p><p>\tThe room erupted into mutters as people took in what you were saying. You knew what they were wondering. Why would someone from America come to Japan? There were plenty good hero academies in America. You had your own reasons for coming to UA, but you wouldn\u2019t share them.</p><p>\t\u201c[Y/n]\u2026could you please stop using your quirk\u2026or did you bring eye drops for me?\u201d One of the real Mr. Aizawa\u2019s eyebrows rose.</p><p>\tYou smiled, \u201cI know you aren\u2019t going to use your erasure on me. But okay.\u201d You turned back to the students who were still staring at you in various degrees of confusion, admiration, and fear, \u201cPlease\u2026take in mind that since I came from America\u2026Where women can dress very differently\u2026that I mean no offense by my outfit.\u201d</p><p>\tMr. Aizawa let out a long suffering sigh, \u201cWhere is your uniform [Y/n]?\u201d</p><p>\tYou turned, sheepish, \u201cI uh,\u201d You rubbed the back of your head, still as Mr. Aizawa, \u201cMight have lost it at customs earlier this week.\u201d</p><p>\tAnother long suffering sigh and a wave of his hands, \u201cReturn to normal and I\u2019ll have another student take you to the office to get a new one.\u201d</p><p>\tTaking a deep, calming breath, you let your quirk fade out.

Without looking back, you ran out of the room.</p><p>\tTurning a corner, you listened as footsteps followed.</p><p>\tYour memories forced you back to a time before everything\u2026a time of innocence. Two young boys and a girl playing in a river together. Proclaiming that they each would become a hero one day.</p><p>\tYou hadn\u2019t realized it, but you were now on the floor, hyperventilating as the memories overpowered you.</p><p>\t\u201cHey\u2026are you okay?\u201d That soft voice again. Still the same as it was all those years ago.</p><p>\tYou looked up at Izuku Midoriya\u2026the same child who used to play with you and Kacchan\u2026Katsuki Bakugou all those years ago.</p><p>\tYou saw the moment his eyes widened in recognition, \u201cMariko Ad-\u201d </p><p>\tYou jumped up, hand flying out to cover his mouth. He jumped and struggled, but your grip was strong.</p><p>\tSparing a glance to the hallways, making sure no one else was around, you tugged Izuku further into the shadows before releasing his mouth.</p><p>\tHe frowned at you, \u201cMariko, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d<br>\tYou hissed, \u201cI\u2019m not Mar-\u201d You couldn\u2019t say the name, biting the inside of your cheek, you flinched and sighed, running a hand through your hair.</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019m \u00a0[Y/n]. That, \u201cYou spat out, \u201cother person is dead.\u201d</p><p>\tYou knew you were confusing the boy. </p><p>\t\u201cLook, Izuku\u2026let\u2019s find somewhere else to talk. I\u2019ll\u2026I\u2019ll explain everything.\u201d Shoulders sagging in defeat, you followed your old childhood friend to an empty classroom.</p><p>\tJumping, you sat on the desk across from the chair that Izuku sat in. He looked up at you, those big eyes waiting.</p><p>\tYou closed your eyes for a minute. Trying to calm the storm inside. The fibers of your being that were yelling at you to run away. That this was a mistake.</p><p>\t\u201cI see you finally developed a quirk. I\u2019m sorry I wasn\u2019t here when it showed. Did it happen right after..?\u201d </p><p>\tLooking at Izuku, you saw him fidget, and his eyes dart around. Narrowing your eyes, you knew something was up.</p><p>\tBut he didn\u2019t cave, \u201cYeah. It\u2019s strength, agility and mobility\u2026and Well\u2026you left before your quirk showed too.\u201d</p><p>\tYou groaned, pushing the palms of your hands into your eyes, \u201cI didn\u2019t leave!\u201d</p><p>\tThat came out harsher than you planned.</p><p>\tTaking a deep breathe, you lowered your hands and opened them pleadingly to the tense boy, \u201cI didn\u2019t leave.\u201d You repeated, softer this time.</p><p>\tIzuku leaned forward, confusion all over his face, \u201cWhat do you mean? One minute, you were next door and the next minute, you were gone. No one knew where you or your parents were. But none of the police were concerned, saying that it was all official business and that there was nothing to worry about.\u201d</p><p>\tYou let out a short sarcastic bark of laughter, \u201cOf course they did. They couldn\u2019t have it be known that two of the cities finest citizen quirk users were brutally slaughtered in their own home.\u201d</p><p>\tA horrified gasp.</p><p>\tYour eyes were staring at Izuku, but were unfocused..seeing the past. Your folks both had powerful quirks, but they never went pro. Choosing instead to follow business jobs and staying at home to raise you.</p><p>\tUntil that day you came home from a day of playing with Izuku and Katsuki, excited to show your parents the quirk that had showed itself on your way home and found..</p><p>\tYou shuddered, bringing yourself back to the present, you hung your head, staring at the ground, \u201cI still have nightmares. I\u2019ll spare you the details of what I stumbled upon at five years old.\u201d</p><p>\tA cold hand grabbed yours, \u201cMari\u2026I mean [Y/n]\u2026I had no idea. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>\tYou laughed again, a bitter sound, \u201cYeah. Everyone was so damn sorry. The police officers, the case workers, the mayor. Everyone was so damn sorry but they did nothing. Those villains got away with killing innocent people and no one gave a damn.\u201d</p><p>\tYou were getting heated. Standing up, you began pacing at the front of the empty classroom.</p><p>\t\u201cBut what happened? Why did you disappear?\u201d Izuku muttered, more to himself than you.</p><p>\tYou answered, your voice growing thick and emotional, \u201cA few days after, I was stuck at the police precinct\u2026they didn\u2019t want anyone to get wind of the murders\u2026they knew it would only cause panic and chaos. That was how Shota Aizawa found me.\u201d</p><p>\tYou paused your pacing for a moment, before starting up again.</p><p>\tIzuku leaned back, stunned, \u201cYou met Mr. Aizawa when he was still doing Hero work?\u201d Obvious Awe in his voice.</p><p>\tYou smiled softly, he was still the same five year old nerd you remembered.</p><p>\t\u201cHe was bringing in some low level thugs when he saw me crying in an interrogation room that was being used as a temporary room for me. He came in and talked to me, calmed me down. He showed up everyday for a week before he finally decided to talk to an official about my situation. When he learned that I had no relatives and nobody knew what to do with me, he decided to take custody of me.\u201d</p><p>\tIzuku gasped, \u201cSo you\u2019re technically..\u201d </p><p>\tYou walked back to the desk he sat in, perching on the edge, you smiled again, \u201cYeah I\u2019m technically his kid. At least, according to the courts. He adopted me. I thought he would keep me with him. But..\u201d You trailed off again.</p><p>\tNow that Izuku had gotten you talking, it actually felt good to get this all off your chest.</p><p>\t\u201cHe said his line of work was too dangerous. So he sent me to New York where a friend lived.\u201d</p><p>\tIzuku snorted, before realizing what he had done and promptly covering his mouth with his hands, his face turning red.</p><p>\tYou snorted after, \u201cIt\u2019s okay. I know it doesn\u2019t seem like Shota has friends. But he does\u2026did..anyways. Back when he was still Eraserhead. I grew up in New York\u2026.until I was old enough to apply for UA. Shota told me not to. He kept in contact all these years, but I am determined. I\u2019m going to become a hero and I\u2019m going to find the villains that killed them.\u201d</p><p>\tIzuku\u2019s coloring gradually returned to normal and he looked at you concerned, \u201c[Y/n]\u2026revenge isn\u2019t something you should go after. A hero can\u2019t use their quirks outside government regulations and certainly not for personal justice. You know this.\u201d He tilted his head, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you keep in contact with me or kacchan?\u201d He sounded hurt.</p><p>\tYou gently ruffled his hair, \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I was just five. Scared. Hurt. In a new country. By the time I thought about contacting you\u2026it had been a few years and I figured you both had moved on with your lives and I would just mess them up. That\u2019s why I was hoping neither of you recognized me.\u201d</p><p>\tIzuku laughed, \u201cI don\u2019t think Kacchan recognized you. I barely did with how you\u2019re dressed.\u201d He waved a hand at you, averting his eyes from your body, though his face still turned slightly red.</p><p>\tYou laughed, \u201cYeah. I got used to the customs in America. I need to remember how to behave in Japan.\u201d</p><p>\tIzuku sighed, \u201c[Y/n]\u2026you can\u2019t let this revenge cloud your vision or decide your future\u2026Why can\u2019t you just be Mariko?\u201d</p><p>\tYour eyes burned, you stood up again, towering over Izuku who for once looked terrified at you, \u201cMariko Adohira is dead! They died with their parents. I am Aizawa [Y/n] now and forever. I won\u2019t let those villains who killed my parents find me.\u201d</p><p>\tIzuku\u2019s terrified expression turned to one of intense thinking, \u201cYou think they will target you after ten years?\u201d</p><p>\tYou stood tall, staring out at nothing, but seeing the shadowy figures that haunted your nightmares, \u201cI don\u2019t know. But for now, I have the element of surprise and I\u2019m not losing it.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p><b></b></p><p><b>FOREVER Taglist:</b></p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mueqGDjNU-px9eazPTAiIaw\">@sxph-t</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m6JrH0mInv0_jJIQb7ThoRQ\">@mialeelavellan</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mezyjFsJ8KB5sI8HvSbv3Pg\">@rainydaysrnevergrey</a>\u00a0 <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mR_UCwARCul9gSnnNyDqpOQ\">@platonic-plots</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/maKNWOBDx1gFx-pwWIPIqLA\">@sociallyawkwardcircus-freak-hi</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mXMa1-Lg1MwHvfZ4eHrQ8Pg\">@ayyidkeither</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYmLRg0re4tEdiXOVlxPUfA\">@queenbbarnes</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mMa22YNJDzooYAhgSdAUaHA\">@mythixmagic</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mCCNAjP9ndzMFGDkgSK-_sw\">@chas-z</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mbgCK4NETm23uYtIEABN6-A\">@thefridgeismybestie</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mkPOqWgH7GCQm2YsvdXy7OQ\">@strangersstranger</a></p></p>",

So he sent me to New York where a friend lived.&rdquo;</p><p>\tIzuku snorted, before realizing what he had done and promptly covering his mouth with his hands, his face turning red.</p><p>\tYou snorted after, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay. I know it doesn&rsquo;t seem like Shota has friends. But he does&hellip;did..anyways. Back when he was still Eraserhead. I grew up in New York&hellip;.until I was old enough to apply for UA. Shota told me not to. He kept in contact all these years, but I am determined. I&rsquo;m going to become a hero and I&rsquo;m going to find the villains that killed them.&rdquo;</p><p>\tIzuku&rsquo;s coloring gradually returned to normal and he looked at you concerned, &ldquo;[Y/n]&hellip;revenge isn&rsquo;t something you should go after. A hero can&rsquo;t use their quirks outside government regulations and certainly not for personal justice. You know this.&rdquo; He tilted his head, &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you keep in contact with me or kacchan?&rdquo; He sounded hurt.</p><p>\tYou gently ruffled his hair, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry. I was just five. Scared. Hurt. In a new country. By the time I thought about contacting you&hellip;it had been a few years and I figured you both had moved on with your lives and I would just mess them up. That&rsquo;s why I was hoping neither of you recognized me.&rdquo;</p><p>\tIzuku laughed, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think Kacchan recognized you. I barely did with how you&rsquo;re dressed.&rdquo; He waved a hand at you, averting his eyes from your body, though his face still turned slightly red.</p><p>\tYou laughed, &ldquo;Yeah. I got used to the customs in America. I need to remember how to behave in Japan.&rdquo;</p><p>\tIzuku sighed, &ldquo;[Y/n]&hellip;you can&rsquo;t let this revenge cloud your vision or decide your future&hellip;Why can&rsquo;t you just be Mariko?&rdquo;</p><p>\tYour eyes burned, you stood up again, towering over Izuku who for once looked terrified at you, &ldquo;Mariko Adohira is dead! They died with their parents. I am Aizawa [Y/n] now and forever. I won&rsquo;t let those villains who killed my parents find me.&rdquo;</p><p>\tIzuku&rsquo;s terrified expression turned to one of intense thinking, &ldquo;You think they will target you after ten years?&rdquo;</p><p>\tYou stood tall, staring out at nothing, but seeing the shadowy figures that haunted your nightmares, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. But for now, I have the element of surprise and I&rsquo;m not losing it.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p><b></b></p><p><b>FOREVER Taglist:</b></p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mueqGDjNU-px9eazPTAiIaw\">@sxph-t</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m6JrH0mInv0_jJIQb7ThoRQ\">@mialeelavellan</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mezyjFsJ8KB5sI8HvSbv3Pg\">@rainydaysrnevergrey</a>&nbsp; <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mR_UCwARCul9gSnnNyDqpOQ\">@platonic-plots</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/maKNWOBDx1gFx-pwWIPIqLA\">@sociallyawkwardcircus-freak-hi</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mXMa1-Lg1MwHvfZ4eHrQ8Pg\">@ayyidkeither</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYmLRg0re4tEdiXOVlxPUfA\">@queenbbarnes</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mMa22YNJDzooYAhgSdAUaHA\">@mythixmagic</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mCCNAjP9ndzMFGDkgSK-_sw\">@chas-z</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mbgCK4NETm23uYtIEABN6-A\">@thefridgeismybestie</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mkPOqWgH7GCQm2YsvdXy7OQ\">@strangersstranger</a></p></p>",
