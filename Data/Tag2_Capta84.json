Don\u2019t you see the connection, Nick?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cWell yeah, I haven\u2019t not thought about that but-\u201d Before Nick could finish, Carol, alien in question, was facing you. Her nose just barely brushed against your own as her deep brown eyes stared you down. Unlike Nick\u2019s eyes, that glimmered with humor even in such a dire situation, Carol\u2019s were almost alarmingly cold. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not here to hurt people,\u201d her voice mirrored her stoney expression as she spoke, \u201cI\u2019m here to end a war before more people are hurt.\u201d It was hard to discern whether it was Carol\u2019s close proximity to you or the serious glint in her eyes, but your breath caught in your throat. Warmth flooded your face to reveal a your feeling of embarrassment.</p><p>\u201cSorry for my assumption,\u201d you said softly, your voice betraying you. With her so close, you could see flecks of gold in the rich brown of her irises. For an alien, she had very human, and very pretty, eyes. It was then you noticed, despite how close she was already, Carol leaned in further with furrowed brows. Her lips parted as if she were about to respond but Nick, watching the scene carry on, cleared his throat.</p><p>\u201cAre we done, cos, we got a world to save still?\u201d Still peering into your eyes, Carol nodded. A moment later she was standing in front of your window, gazing out across the city. You spared a glance at Nick who merely shrugged, \u201cmaybe she likes you?\u201d</p><p>-</p><p>\u201cWhen I agreed to help you, this is not what I imagined,\u201d you said through gritted teeth. Nick let out a laugh, nearly spilling his glass of sweet iced tea as you spun Monica around. </p><p>\u201cWorking with SHIELD comes with it\u2019s perks! You should reconsider my offer, Y/N, you\u2019d make a fine agent.\u201d Monica giggled as you set her feet back down on solid dirt.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not an agent?\u201d She asked, her brown eyes widening slightly as she added, \u201cBut you\u2019re so good at fighting! You almost beat the-\u201d</p><p>\u201cMonica!\u201d Maria shouted before her daughter could finish her sentence. The little girl smiled shyly, glancing over to where her mother and Carol stood on the porch. You followed her gaze, eyes locking with Carol. She looked more in her element than she did when you first met her. No longer wearing her suit, she was clad in a loose fitting shirt and jeans that, when she had first changed, made your jaw drop. You had tried your hardest not to ogle and it seemed she didn\u2019t notice as she continued to spout on about the Cree.</p><p>Now, however, in the light of the setting Southern sun, it was hard to ignore her beauty. Even in conservation, the way she held herself was strong. It was something to admire; something about the woman that had stuck with you. You hoped that, maybe, after everything, she would stay and you could admire her some more.</p><p>\u201cY/N?\u201d Nick\u2019s voice pulled your attention away from Carol back to the lounging form of your friend. He raised his eyebrows, gesturing towards Monica who still stood at your side.</p><p>\u201cOh, sorry, no. No, I\u2019m not an agent.\u201d The little girl frowned, as if asking why.</p><p>\u201cShould be though,\u201d Nick shouted, \u201cyou\u2019re wasting your potential in that stinking office.\u201d You were about to fire back, something mean about being able to shoot straight, but Carol beat you to the punch.</p><p>\u201cBut then she\u2019d have to wear one of those stupid hats, Fury,\u201d she joked. A smile spread against your lips, sending her a grateful glance to the woman from over your shoulder. Monica giggled before pulling on your hand to get your attention.</p><p>\u201cWe could make new hats for SHIELD! Maybe then you\u2019ll be an agent?\u201d You bit your bottom lip, finding it hard to say no to the little girl before you with her wide eyes. Sighing, you glimpsed back up at Carol who, much to your surprise, was smiling too.</p><p>\u201cI guess it\u2019s worth a try, yeah?\u201d You said, bringing an impossibly large grin to Monica\u2019s lips. The girl cheered before taking your hand to lead you back inside the house. She raced up the steps, pulling you along and through the door. If it wasn\u2019t for Carol grabbing your arm, you would have been covered in glue and fabric pieces.</p><p>\u201cI actually need Y/N\u2019s help for minute, Lieutenant Trouble. That okay?\u201d Monica\u2019s gaze jumped from you to Carol and back again before nodding with a smile. Before you could protest, she darted into the house with Maria following after he daughter.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d You ask, turning to face the blonde. She leaned in close, much like the first time you met her, and a blush immediately rose to your cheeks. Carol\u2019s brows furrowed when she noticed the flush, cocking her head to the side.</p><p>\u201cWhy does your face do that?\u201d She reached a hand up and brushed her fingers against your cheek. The touch sent a shock through you, tickling down your spine and nearly coaxed your eyes to close. Before you could, you lifted a hand to grab her wrist, pulling it away from your cheek. Somehow you managed to catch your breath enough to reply.</p><p>\u201cYou would think an advanced alien race would know what a blush is,\u201d you drawled, \u201cand how not to invade one\u2019s personal space.\u201d A smile formed on Carol\u2019s lips as she leaned a little closer. Another thing to admire: her daring demeanor.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not an alien, not really,\u201d she said, referencing her life altering revelation that had occurred a mere few hours ago. You nodded, licking your lips slightly in the hopes to distract yourself from how she had licked her own.</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re still out of this world,\u201d you said, nearly laughing at your own tilted attempt at flirting. However, the laugh that rang out from Carol\u2019s lips gave you a spark of hope. It was such a lovely sound and part of you wondered how you had gone so long without hearing it.</p><p>\u201cSmooth,\u201d she teased, \u201cI\u2019ll have to remember that one.\u201d You let out a nervous laugh, shifting your gaze to your hands. It was then you realized you still had your fingers around her wrist. Quickly, to negate the tension, you let her go.</p><p>\u201cSo, uh, what did you need?\u201d You took a step back so you could more comfortably talk with her, but Carol leaned in again. That hint of joy that your joke had caused dwindled until it was replaced with a solemnity that scared you slightly. </p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re almost done with the ship,\u201d she said jerking her head over to where the Skrulls were working on the place she had stolen. \u201cWhen we go up there, I want you to stay behind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, what? Excuse me?\u201d Your light hearted banter and hope died when the words sunk in. \u201cIf Nick is going, if you\u2019re going, then I am too. We\u2019ve done too much to-\u201d</p><p>\u201cY/N\u201d she interrupted, her expression morphing from one of gravity to one of desperate earnestness. \u201cPlease, I need to know that you\u2019re&hellip;that Monica is with someone capable. Maria\u2019s parents wouldn\u2019t be able to fight if something goes wrong.\u201d You bit the inside of your cheek, nodding until your gaze hit the floor. It made sense, but it didn\u2019t numb the sting.</p><p>\u201cSomeone capable,\u201d you repeated, lifting your gaze to Carol\u2019s, \u201cthat\u2019s all I am, yeah?\u201d Before she could reply or dare to close the gap between you, you stormed into the house. \u201cYou got it, Captain,\u201d you shouted, \u201cI\u2019ll stay put.\u201d</p><p>-</p><!-- more --><p>\u201cSo this is it,\u201d you said, walking up to Carol. She was glowing under the kitchen lights of the Rambeau home. Despite saving countless lives, there she was before you, doing the dishes. \u201cYou saved, not only Earth but a few dozen, million people. Congratulations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she said, trying to find a way to be humble, \u201cI guess I did.\u201d You smiled as you settled to stand beside her. Grabbing a rag, you helped speed the cleaning process along. Every now and then, you hand would brush against hers, sending little bolts up your arms.</p><p>\u201cSo what now?\u201d You stopped cleaning and turned your head to look into her eyes. Carol was finishing up drying the plate you had given her, avoiding your eyes. When she was done, she sighed and turned to face you. Her eyes were bright, light with the weight of the world(s) off her shoulders for a moment of respite. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to help the Skrull, they deserve, they need, a home after all the Cree have stolen from them. I have to make it up to them, it\u2019s what\u2019s right.\u201d You nodded, swallowing the words that threatened to pour out of your mouth. Despite your best efforts, they did anyway.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019 not your debt to pay, you know. You could stay here.\u201d You lifted your eyes to hold her gaze, expecting to she a very offended and pissed off woman before you. However, Carol took you in with a softness you had hardly ever seen from her. She stepped towards you until your noses were nearly touching. </p><p>\u201cWould you want that?\u201d Her tone is ribbing, bordering on taunting if it weren\u2019t for the note of genuine interest. Your eyes flickered from hers to her lips, trying hard to remain focused despite her closeness. </p><p>\u201cI would,\u201d you admit, taking notice of the smile that bloomed on her lips when you did. Suddenly feeling like you overstepped, took something, namely your feelings, too far, you added, \u201cI would definitely feel safer, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa, yeah, you and everyone else,\u201d she teased, leaning closer, \u201cbut you, is there any reason why you-\u201d</p><p>\u201cLadies! Maria has sent me to get desert,\u201d Nick announced as he paraded into the kitchen. Monica and Talo\u2019s daughter were hot on his heels, eager for the secret sweets. You immediately pulled away from Carol and offered them all a smile.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get it then, shall we?\u201d The girls giggled and Carol watched on as you helped them. Her eyes never once left you, not even when you said your final goodbyes. An all too quick hug, her hand on your head to hold you close. You could remember the look in her eyes as she took off with the Skrulls. She wasn\u2019t sad, presay, but there was a glimmer of something lost as she took to the skies.</p><p>-</p><p>\u201cSo what does it do exactly?\u201d Bruce asked for the hundredth time that evening. You rolled your eyes, pushing away from the desk full of files labelled in red. Missing Persons. </p><p>\u201cNick never told me exactly,\u201d you explained, \u201cnot even when I officially joined SHIELD. He just told me that I would know when it happens.\u201d Bruce let out a dissatisfied huff and continued to watching the blinking light on the pager. You did too, reflecting on the time when you last remembered using one. It was vivid in your mind, handing the device to Carol after Nick had alerted the entirety of Skrull invaders to his presence. It was fond looking back, especially now that there was only a few left to muse on memories. </p><p>You were turning back to your desk with the thought of Thanos and the hunger of vengeance churning in your mind when Bruce gasped. Looking over your shoulder, you gasped too. The blinking had stopped. You rushed from your seat and pressed your face to the glass. The life of the device flickered once before it went black.</p><p>\u201cGet the team,\u201d you said and Bruce darted off. Sadly, they didn\u2019t have much to offer in the form of suggestions. Steve was still skeptical about the device and its significance, while Natasha was adamant about its purpose. </p><p>\u201cIt was important to Fury,\u201d you agreed, \u201cwe should keep an eye on it.\u201d You turned on your heels to get back to work but nearly ran face first into someone. If it hadn\u2019t been for the hand that grabbed your arm, you would have landed hard against the floor. Your eyes adjusted, taking in the sight of your savor. </p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarol?\u201d Those same eyes, still bright, smiled down at you. She pulled you back to your feet, close to her own body. \u201cYou haven\u2019t changed,\u201d you teased, noting the lack of room between you. She grinned softly, but there was a darkness in her expression that, you feared, mirrored your own.</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t either, or your want of personal space.\u201d You were half tempted to laugh at her jab, but instead you wrapped your arms around her in a snug embrace. Her strong arms joined around your shoulders, holding your body flush to her own.</p><p>\u201cYou know her, Y/N?\u201d Steve asked, blue eyes wide. You nodded and bit your bottom lip as you still trained your gaze on Carol. Still as awe-inspiring as ever.</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d you said, turning in Carol\u2019s arms. \u201cAvengers, this is Carol Danvers.\u201d</p><p>-</p><p>\u201cStubborn fool,\u201d Carol grumbled, shaking her head as you told her what had happened to Nick. \u201cHe should have paged me earlier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere wasn\u2019t anytime,\u201d you explained, \u201cplus he learned that from you, you know.\u201d Carol chuckled from her chair seated across from you. You leaned over, extending your hand across the coffee table. She mirrored your actions, entangling your fingers together when your hands met in the middle. \u201cI\u2019m happy you\u2019re here now, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too,\u201d she hummed, \u201cI was going to come back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were?\u201d You asked, brows knitted together in confusion. \u201cWhy?\u201d Carol pulled our hand up, drawing you to your feet. Soon, she was standing before you, her face a mere inches away from your own. Just like old times.<br/>\t\u201cI missed you,\u201d she whispered, before pressing her lips to yours. You melted into the touch, your hand trailing up to her blonde hair. Your fingers grew tangled in the locks as you drew her face closer. Her lips were smooth against your own, the kiss full of the tension that had gathered between the two of you from all those years apart. </p><p>\u201cI missed you too,\u201d you replied when she pulled away. \u201cI missed having you in my bubble.\u201d A laugh passed over her lips, the same one that echoed in your memories. Even in the darkness surrounding you know, the darkness shrouding the entire universe, you were more than overjoyed to hear that laugh again. </p>",

You had tried your hardest not to ogle and it seemed she didn&rsquo;t notice as she continued to spout on about the Cree.</p>\n<p>Now, however, in the light of the setting Southern sun, it was hard to ignore her beauty. Even in conservation, the way she held herself was strong. It was something to admire; something about the woman that had stuck with you. You hoped that, maybe, after everything, she would stay and you could admire her some more.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Y/N?&rdquo; Nick&rsquo;s voice pulled your attention away from Carol back to the lounging form of your friend. He raised his eyebrows, gesturing towards Monica who still stood at your side.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Oh, sorry, no. No, I&rsquo;m not an agent.&rdquo; The little girl frowned, as if asking why.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Should be though,&rdquo; Nick shouted, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re wasting your potential in that stinking office.&rdquo; You were about to fire back, something mean about being able to shoot straight, but Carol beat you to the punch.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;But then she&rsquo;d have to wear one of those stupid hats, Fury,&rdquo; she joked. A smile spread against your lips, sending her a grateful glance to the woman from over your shoulder. Monica giggled before pulling on your hand to get your attention.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We could make new hats for SHIELD! Maybe then you&rsquo;ll be an agent?&rdquo; You bit your bottom lip, finding it hard to say no to the little girl before you with her wide eyes. Sighing, you glimpsed back up at Carol who, much to your surprise, was smiling too.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I guess it&rsquo;s worth a try, yeah?&rdquo; You said, bringing an impossibly large grin to Monica&rsquo;s lips. The girl cheered before taking your hand to lead you back inside the house. She raced up the steps, pulling you along and through the door. If it wasn&rsquo;t for Carol grabbing your arm, you would have been covered in glue and fabric pieces.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I actually need Y/N&rsquo;s help for minute, Lieutenant Trouble. That okay?&rdquo; Monica&rsquo;s gaze jumped from you to Carol and back again before nodding with a smile. Before you could protest, she darted into the house with Maria following after he daughter.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; You ask, turning to face the blonde. She leaned in close, much like the first time you met her, and a blush immediately rose to your cheeks. Carol&rsquo;s brows furrowed when she noticed the flush, cocking her head to the side.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Why does your face do that?&rdquo; She reached a hand up and brushed her fingers against your cheek. The touch sent a shock through you, tickling down your spine and nearly coaxed your eyes to close. Before you could, you lifted a hand to grab her wrist, pulling it away from your cheek. Somehow you managed to catch your breath enough to reply.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;You would think an advanced alien race would know what a blush is,&rdquo; you drawled, &ldquo;and how not to invade one&rsquo;s personal space.&rdquo; A smile formed on Carol&rsquo;s lips as she leaned a little closer. Another thing to admire: her daring demeanor.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not an alien, not really,&rdquo; she said, referencing her life altering revelation that had occurred a mere few hours ago. You nodded, licking your lips slightly in the hopes to distract yourself from how she had licked her own.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;re still out of this world,&rdquo; you said, nearly laughing at your own tilted attempt at flirting. However, the laugh that rang out from Carol&rsquo;s lips gave you a spark of hope. It was such a lovely sound and part of you wondered how you had gone so long without hearing it.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Smooth,&rdquo; she teased, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to remember that one.&rdquo; You let out a nervous laugh, shifting your gaze to your hands. It was then you realized you still had your fingers around her wrist. Quickly, to negate the tension, you let her go.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;So, uh, what did you need?&rdquo; You took a step back so you could more comfortably talk with her, but Carol leaned in again. That hint of joy that your joke had caused dwindled until it was replaced with a solemnity that scared you slightly. </p>\n<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re almost done with the ship,&rdquo; she said jerking her head over to where the Skrulls were working on the place she had stolen. &ldquo;When we go up there, I want you to stay behind.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Um, what? Excuse me?&rdquo; Your light hearted banter and hope died when the words sunk in. &ldquo;If Nick is going, if you&rsquo;re going, then I am too. We&rsquo;ve done too much to-&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Y/N&rdquo; she interrupted, her expression morphing from one of gravity to one of desperate earnestness. &ldquo;Please, I need to know that you&rsquo;re&hellip;that Monica is with someone capable. Maria&rsquo;s parents wouldn&rsquo;t be able to fight if something goes wrong.&rdquo; You bit the inside of your cheek, nodding until your gaze hit the floor. It made sense, but it didn&rsquo;t numb the sting.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Someone capable,&rdquo; you repeated, lifting your gaze to Carol&rsquo;s, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s all I am, yeah?&rdquo; Before she could reply or dare to close the gap between you, you stormed into the house. &ldquo;You got it, Captain,&rdquo; you shouted, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll stay put.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>-</p>\n",

Don\u2019t you see the connection, Nick?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWell yeah, I haven\u2019t not thought about that but-\u201d Before Nick could finish, Carol, alien in question, was facing you. Her nose just barely brushed against your own as her deep brown eyes stared you down. Unlike Nick\u2019s eyes, that glimmered with humor even in such a dire situation, Carol\u2019s were almost alarmingly cold. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not here to hurt people,\u201d her voice mirrored her stoney expression as she spoke, \u201cI\u2019m here to end a war before more people are hurt.\u201d It was hard to discern whether it was Carol\u2019s close proximity to you or the serious glint in her eyes, but your breath caught in your throat. Warmth flooded your face to reveal a your feeling of embarrassment.</p><p>\u201cSorry for my assumption,\u201d you said softly, your voice betraying you. With her so close, you could see flecks of gold in the rich brown of her irises. For an alien, she had very human, and very pretty, eyes. It was then you noticed, despite how close she was already, Carol leaned in further with furrowed brows. Her lips parted as if she were about to respond but Nick, watching the scene carry on, cleared his throat.</p><p>\u201cAre we done, cos, we got a world to save still?\u201d Still peering into your eyes, Carol nodded. A moment later she was standing in front of your window, gazing out across the city. You spared a glance at Nick who merely shrugged, \u201cmaybe she likes you?\u201d</p><p>-</p><p>\u201cWhen I agreed to help you, this is not what I imagined,\u201d you said through gritted teeth. Nick let out a laugh, nearly spilling his glass of sweet iced tea as you spun Monica around. </p><p>\u201cWorking with SHIELD comes with it\u2019s perks! You should reconsider my offer, Y/N, you\u2019d make a fine agent.\u201d Monica giggled as you set her feet back down on solid dirt.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not an agent?\u201d She asked, her brown eyes widening slightly as she added, \u201cBut you\u2019re so good at fighting! You almost beat the-\u201d</p><p>\u201cMonica!\u201d Maria shouted before her daughter could finish her sentence.

She was glowing under the kitchen lights of the Rambeau home. Despite saving countless lives, there she was before you, doing the dishes. \u201cYou saved, not only Earth but a few dozen, million people. Congratulations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she said, trying to find a way to be humble, \u201cI guess I did.\u201d You smiled as you settled to stand beside her. Grabbing a rag, you helped speed the cleaning process along. Every now and then, you hand would brush against hers, sending little bolts up your arms.</p><p>\u201cSo what now?\u201d You stopped cleaning and turned your head to look into her eyes. Carol was finishing up drying the plate you had given her, avoiding your eyes. When she was done, she sighed and turned to face you. Her eyes were bright, light with the weight of the world(s) off her shoulders for a moment of respite. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to help the Skrull, they deserve, they need, a home after all the Cree have stolen from them. I have to make it up to them, it\u2019s what\u2019s right.\u201d You nodded, swallowing the words that threatened to pour out of your mouth. Despite your best efforts, they did anyway.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019 not your debt to pay, you know. You could stay here.\u201d You lifted your eyes to hold her gaze, expecting to she a very offended and pissed off woman before you. However, Carol took you in with a softness you had hardly ever seen from her. She stepped towards you until your noses were nearly touching. </p><p>\u201cWould you want that?\u201d Her tone is ribbing, bordering on taunting if it weren\u2019t for the note of genuine interest. Your eyes flickered from hers to her lips, trying hard to remain focused despite her closeness. </p><p>\u201cI would,\u201d you admit, taking notice of the smile that bloomed on her lips when you did. Suddenly feeling like you overstepped, took something, namely your feelings, too far, you added, \u201cI would definitely feel safer, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa, yeah, you and everyone else,\u201d she teased, leaning closer, \u201cbut you, is there any reason why you-\u201d</p><p>\u201cLadies! Maria has sent me to get desert,\u201d Nick announced as he paraded into the kitchen. Monica and Talo\u2019s daughter were hot on his heels, eager for the secret sweets. You immediately pulled away from Carol and offered them all a smile.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get it then, shall we?\u201d The girls giggled and Carol watched on as you helped them. Her eyes never once left you, not even when you said your final goodbyes. An all too quick hug, her hand on your head to hold you close. You could remember the look in her eyes as she took off with the Skrulls. She wasn\u2019t sad, presay, but there was a glimmer of something lost as she took to the skies.</p><p>-</p><p>\u201cSo what does it do exactly?\u201d Bruce asked for the hundredth time that evening. You rolled your eyes, pushing away from the desk full of files labelled in red. Missing Persons. </p><p>\u201cNick never told me exactly,\u201d you explained, \u201cnot even when I officially joined SHIELD. He just told me that I would know when it happens.\u201d Bruce let out a dissatisfied huff and continued to watching the blinking light on the pager. You did too, reflecting on the time when you last remembered using one. It was vivid in your mind, handing the device to Carol after Nick had alerted the entirety of Skrull invaders to his presence. It was fond looking back, especially now that there was only a few left to muse on memories. </p><p>You were turning back to your desk with the thought of Thanos and the hunger of vengeance churning in your mind when Bruce gasped. Looking over your shoulder, you gasped too. The blinking had stopped. You rushed from your seat and pressed your face to the glass. The life of the device flickered once before it went black.</p><p>\u201cGet the team,\u201d you said and Bruce darted off. Sadly, they didn\u2019t have much to offer in the form of suggestions. Steve was still skeptical about the device and its significance, while Natasha was adamant about its purpose. </p><p>\u201cIt was important to Fury,\u201d you agreed, \u201cwe should keep an eye on it.\u201d You turned on your heels to get back to work but nearly ran face first into someone. If it hadn\u2019t been for the hand that grabbed your arm, you would have landed hard against the floor. Your eyes adjusted, taking in the sight of your savor. </p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarol?\u201d Those same eyes, still bright, smiled down at you. She pulled you back to your feet, close to her own body. \u201cYou haven\u2019t changed,\u201d you teased, noting the lack of room between you. She grinned softly, but there was a darkness in her expression that, you feared, mirrored your own.</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t either, or your want of personal space.\u201d You were half tempted to laugh at her jab, but instead you wrapped your arms around her in a snug embrace. Her strong arms joined around your shoulders, holding your body flush to her own.</p><p>\u201cYou know her, Y/N?\u201d Steve asked, blue eyes wide. You nodded and bit your bottom lip as you still trained your gaze on Carol. Still as awe-inspiring as ever.</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d you said, turning in Carol\u2019s arms. \u201cAvengers, this is Carol Danvers.\u201d</p><p>-</p><p>\u201cStubborn fool,\u201d Carol grumbled, shaking her head as you told her what had happened to Nick. \u201cHe should have paged me earlier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere wasn\u2019t anytime,\u201d you explained, \u201cplus he learned that from you, you know.\u201d Carol chuckled from her chair seated across from you. You leaned over, extending your hand across the coffee table. She mirrored your actions, entangling your fingers together when your hands met in the middle. \u201cI\u2019m happy you\u2019re here now, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too,\u201d she hummed, \u201cI was going to come back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were?\u201d You asked, brows knitted together in confusion. \u201cWhy?\u201d Carol pulled our hand up, drawing you to your feet. Soon, she was standing before you, her face a mere inches away from your own. Just like old times.<br>\t\u201cI missed you,\u201d she whispered, before pressing her lips to yours. You melted into the touch, your hand trailing up to her blonde hair. Your fingers grew tangled in the locks as you drew her face closer. Her lips were smooth against your own, the kiss full of the tension that had gathered between the two of you from all those years apart. </p><p>\u201cI missed you too,\u201d you replied when she pulled away. \u201cI missed having you in my bubble.\u201d A laugh passed over her lips, the same one that echoed in your memories. Even in the darkness surrounding you know, the darkness shrouding the entire universe, you were more than overjoyed to hear that laugh again. </p>",

Unlike Nick\u2019s eyes, that glimmered with humor even in such a dire situation, Carol\u2019s were almost alarmingly cold. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not here to hurt people,\u201d her voice mirrored her stoney expression as she spoke, \u201cI\u2019m here to end a war before more people are hurt.\u201d It was hard to discern whether it was Carol\u2019s close proximity to you or the serious glint in her eyes, but your breath caught in your throat. Warmth flooded your face to reveal a your feeling of embarrassment.</p><p>\u201cSorry for my assumption,\u201d you said softly, your voice betraying you. With her so close, you could see flecks of gold in the rich brown of her irises. For an alien, she had very human, and very pretty, eyes. It was then you noticed, despite how close she was already, Carol leaned in further with furrowed brows. Her lips parted as if she were about to respond but Nick, watching the scene carry on, cleared his throat.</p><p>\u201cAre we done, cos, we got a world to save still?\u201d Still peering into your eyes, Carol nodded. A moment later she was standing in front of your window, gazing out across the city. You spared a glance at Nick who merely shrugged, \u201cmaybe she likes you?\u201d</p><p>-</p><p>\u201cWhen I agreed to help you, this is not what I imagined,\u201d you said through gritted teeth. Nick let out a laugh, nearly spilling his glass of sweet iced tea as you spun Monica around. </p><p>\u201cWorking with SHIELD comes with it\u2019s perks! You should reconsider my offer, Y/N, you\u2019d make a fine agent.\u201d Monica giggled as you set her feet back down on solid dirt.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not an agent?\u201d She asked, her brown eyes widening slightly as she added, \u201cBut you\u2019re so good at fighting! You almost beat the-\u201d</p><p>\u201cMonica!\u201d Maria shouted before her daughter could finish her sentence. The little girl smiled shyly, glancing over to where her mother and Carol stood on the porch. You followed her gaze, eyes locking with Carol. She looked more in her element than she did when you first met her. No longer wearing her suit, she was clad in a loose fitting shirt and jeans that, when she had first changed, made your jaw drop. You had tried your hardest not to ogle and it seemed she didn\u2019t notice as she continued to spout on about the Cree.</p><p>Now, however, in the light of the setting Southern sun, it was hard to ignore her beauty. Even in conservation, the way she held herself was strong. It was something to admire; something about the woman that had stuck with you. You hoped that, maybe, after everything, she would stay and you could admire her some more.</p><p>\u201cY/N?\u201d Nick\u2019s voice pulled your attention away from Carol back to the lounging form of your friend. He raised his eyebrows, gesturing towards Monica who still stood at your side.</p><p>\u201cOh, sorry, no. No, I\u2019m not an agent.\u201d The little girl frowned, as if asking why.</p><p>\u201cShould be though,\u201d Nick shouted, \u201cyou\u2019re wasting your potential in that stinking office.\u201d You were about to fire back, something mean about being able to shoot straight, but Carol beat you to the punch.</p><p>\u201cBut then she\u2019d have to wear one of those stupid hats, Fury,\u201d she joked. A smile spread against your lips, sending her a grateful glance to the woman from over your shoulder. Monica giggled before pulling on your hand to get your attention.</p><p>\u201cWe could make new hats for SHIELD! Maybe then you\u2019ll be an agent?\u201d You bit your bottom lip, finding it hard to say no to the little girl before you with her wide eyes. Sighing, you glimpsed back up at Carol who, much to your surprise, was smiling too.</p><p>\u201cI guess it\u2019s worth a try, yeah?\u201d You said, bringing an impossibly large grin to Monica\u2019s lips. The girl cheered before taking your hand to lead you back inside the house. She raced up the steps, pulling you along and through the door. If it wasn\u2019t for Carol grabbing your arm, you would have been covered in glue and fabric pieces.</p><p>\u201cI actually need Y/N\u2019s help for minute, Lieutenant Trouble. That okay?\u201d Monica\u2019s gaze jumped from you to Carol and back again before nodding with a smile. Before you could protest, she darted into the house with Maria following after he daughter.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d You ask, turning to face the blonde. She leaned in close, much like the first time you met her, and a blush immediately rose to your cheeks. Carol\u2019s brows furrowed when she noticed the flush, cocking her head to the side.</p><p>\u201cWhy does your face do that?\u201d She reached a hand up and brushed her fingers against your cheek. The touch sent a shock through you, tickling down your spine and nearly coaxed your eyes to close. Before you could, you lifted a hand to grab her wrist, pulling it away from your cheek. Somehow you managed to catch your breath enough to reply.</p><p>\u201cYou would think an advanced alien race would know what a blush is,\u201d you drawled, \u201cand how not to invade one\u2019s personal space.\u201d A smile formed on Carol\u2019s lips as she leaned a little closer. Another thing to admire: her daring demeanor.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not an alien, not really,\u201d she said, referencing her life altering revelation that had occurred a mere few hours ago. You nodded, licking your lips slightly in the hopes to distract yourself from how she had licked her own.</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re still out of this world,\u201d you said, nearly laughing at your own tilted attempt at flirting. However, the laugh that rang out from Carol\u2019s lips gave you a spark of hope. It was such a lovely sound and part of you wondered how you had gone so long without hearing it.</p><p>\u201cSmooth,\u201d she teased, \u201cI\u2019ll have to remember that one.\u201d You let out a nervous laugh, shifting your gaze to your hands. It was then you realized you still had your fingers around her wrist. Quickly, to negate the tension, you let her go.</p><p>\u201cSo, uh, what did you need?\u201d You took a step back so you could more comfortably talk with her, but Carol leaned in again. That hint of joy that your joke had caused dwindled until it was replaced with a solemnity that scared you slightly. </p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re almost done with the ship,\u201d she said jerking her head over to where the Skrulls were working on the place she had stolen. \u201cWhen we go up there, I want you to stay behind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, what? Excuse me?\u201d Your light hearted banter and hope died when the words sunk in. \u201cIf Nick is going, if you\u2019re going, then I am too. We\u2019ve done too much to-\u201d</p><p>\u201cY/N\u201d she interrupted, her expression morphing from one of gravity to one of desperate earnestness. \u201cPlease, I need to know that you\u2019re\u2026that Monica is with someone capable. Maria\u2019s parents wouldn\u2019t be able to fight if something goes wrong.\u201d You bit the inside of your cheek, nodding until your gaze hit the floor. It made sense, but it didn\u2019t numb the sting.</p><p>\u201cSomeone capable,\u201d you repeated, lifting your gaze to Carol\u2019s, \u201cthat\u2019s all I am, yeah?\u201d Before she could reply or dare to close the gap between you, you stormed into the house. \u201cYou got it, Captain,\u201d you shouted, \u201cI\u2019ll stay put.\u201d</p><p>-</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cSo this is it,\u201d you said, walking up to Carol. She was glowing under the kitchen lights of the Rambeau home. Despite saving countless lives, there she was before you, doing the dishes. \u201cYou saved, not only Earth but a few dozen, million people. Congratulations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she said, trying to find a way to be humble, \u201cI guess I did.\u201d You smiled as you settled to stand beside her. Grabbing a rag, you helped speed the cleaning process along. Every now and then, you hand would brush against hers, sending little bolts up your arms.</p><p>\u201cSo what now?\u201d You stopped cleaning and turned your head to look into her eyes. Carol was finishing up drying the plate you had given her, avoiding your eyes. When she was done, she sighed and turned to face you. Her eyes were bright, light with the weight of the world(s) off her shoulders for a moment of respite. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to help the Skrull, they deserve, they need, a home after all the Cree have stolen from them. I have to make it up to them, it\u2019s what\u2019s right.\u201d You nodded, swallowing the words that threatened to pour out of your mouth. Despite your best efforts, they did anyway.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019 not your debt to pay, you know. You could stay here.\u201d You lifted your eyes to hold her gaze, expecting to she a very offended and pissed off woman before you. However, Carol took you in with a softness you had hardly ever seen from her. She stepped towards you until your noses were nearly touching. </p><p>\u201cWould you want that?\u201d Her tone is ribbing, bordering on taunting if it weren\u2019t for the note of genuine interest. Your eyes flickered from hers to her lips, trying hard to remain focused despite her closeness. </p><p>\u201cI would,\u201d you admit, taking notice of the smile that bloomed on her lips when you did. Suddenly feeling like you overstepped, took something, namely your feelings, too far, you added, \u201cI would definitely feel safer, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa, yeah, you and everyone else,\u201d she teased, leaning closer, \u201cbut you, is there any reason why you-\u201d</p><p>\u201cLadies! Maria has sent me to get desert,\u201d Nick announced as he paraded into the kitchen. Monica and Talo\u2019s daughter were hot on his heels, eager for the secret sweets. You immediately pulled away from Carol and offered them all a smile.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get it then, shall we?\u201d The girls giggled and Carol watched on as you helped them. Her eyes never once left you, not even when you said your final goodbyes. An all too quick hug, her hand on your head to hold you close. You could remember the look in her eyes as she took off with the Skrulls. She wasn\u2019t sad, presay, but there was a glimmer of something lost as she took to the skies.</p><p>-</p><p>\u201cSo what does it do exactly?\u201d Bruce asked for the hundredth time that evening. You rolled your eyes, pushing away from the desk full of files labelled in red. Missing Persons. </p><p>\u201cNick never told me exactly,\u201d you explained, \u201cnot even when I officially joined SHIELD. He just told me that I would know when it happens.\u201d Bruce let out a dissatisfied huff and continued to watching the blinking light on the pager. You did too, reflecting on the time when you last remembered using one. It was vivid in your mind, handing the device to Carol after Nick had alerted the entirety of Skrull invaders to his presence. It was fond looking back, especially now that there was only a few left to muse on memories. </p><p>You were turning back to your desk with the thought of Thanos and the hunger of vengeance churning in your mind when Bruce gasped. Looking over your shoulder, you gasped too. The blinking had stopped. You rushed from your seat and pressed your face to the glass. The life of the device flickered once before it went black.</p><p>\u201cGet the team,\u201d you said and Bruce darted off. Sadly, they didn\u2019t have much to offer in the form of suggestions. Steve was still skeptical about the device and its significance, while Natasha was adamant about its purpose. </p><p>\u201cIt was important to Fury,\u201d you agreed, \u201cwe should keep an eye on it.\u201d You turned on your heels to get back to work but nearly ran face first into someone. If it hadn\u2019t been for the hand that grabbed your arm, you would have landed hard against the floor. Your eyes adjusted, taking in the sight of your savor. </p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarol?\u201d Those same eyes, still bright, smiled down at you. She pulled you back to your feet, close to her own body. \u201cYou haven\u2019t changed,\u201d you teased, noting the lack of room between you. She grinned softly, but there was a darkness in her expression that, you feared, mirrored your own.</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t either, or your want of personal space.\u201d You were half tempted to laugh at her jab, but instead you wrapped your arms around her in a snug embrace. Her strong arms joined around your shoulders, holding your body flush to her own.</p><p>\u201cYou know her, Y/N?\u201d Steve asked, blue eyes wide. You nodded and bit your bottom lip as you still trained your gaze on Carol. Still as awe-inspiring as ever.</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d you said, turning in Carol\u2019s arms. \u201cAvengers, this is Carol Danvers.\u201d</p><p>-</p><p>\u201cStubborn fool,\u201d Carol grumbled, shaking her head as you told her what had happened to Nick. \u201cHe should have paged me earlier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere wasn\u2019t anytime,\u201d you explained, \u201cplus he learned that from you, you know.\u201d Carol chuckled from her chair seated across from you. You leaned over, extending your hand across the coffee table. She mirrored your actions, entangling your fingers together when your hands met in the middle. \u201cI\u2019m happy you\u2019re here now, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too,\u201d she hummed, \u201cI was going to come back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were?\u201d You asked, brows knitted together in confusion. \u201cWhy?\u201d Carol pulled our hand up, drawing you to your feet. Soon, she was standing before you, her face a mere inches away from your own. Just like old times.<br>\t\u201cI missed you,\u201d she whispered, before pressing her lips to yours. You melted into the touch, your hand trailing up to her blonde hair. Your fingers grew tangled in the locks as you drew her face closer. Her lips were smooth against your own, the kiss full of the tension that had gathered between the two of you from all those years apart. </p><p>\u201cI missed you too,\u201d you replied when she pulled away. \u201cI missed having you in my bubble.\u201d A laugh passed over her lips, the same one that echoed in your memories. Even in the darkness surrounding you know, the darkness shrouding the entire universe, you were more than overjoyed to hear that laugh again. </p>",

Still as awe-inspiring as ever.</p><p>&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; you said, turning in Carol&rsquo;s arms. &ldquo;Avengers, this is Carol Danvers.&rdquo;</p><p>-</p><p>&ldquo;Stubborn fool,&rdquo; Carol grumbled, shaking her head as you told her what had happened to Nick. &ldquo;He should have paged me earlier.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;There wasn&rsquo;t anytime,&rdquo; you explained, &ldquo;plus he learned that from you, you know.&rdquo; Carol chuckled from her chair seated across from you. You leaned over, extending your hand across the coffee table. She mirrored your actions, entangling your fingers together when your hands met in the middle. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m happy you&rsquo;re here now, though.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Me too,&rdquo; she hummed, &ldquo;I was going to come back.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You were?&rdquo; You asked, brows knitted together in confusion. &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; Carol pulled our hand up, drawing you to your feet. Soon, she was standing before you, her face a mere inches away from your own. Just like old times.<br />\t&ldquo;I missed you,&rdquo; she whispered, before pressing her lips to yours. You melted into the touch, your hand trailing up to her blonde hair. Your fingers grew tangled in the locks as you drew her face closer. Her lips were smooth against your own, the kiss full of the tension that had gathered between the two of you from all those years apart. </p><p>&ldquo;I missed you too,&rdquo; you replied when she pulled away. &ldquo;I missed having you in my bubble.&rdquo; A laugh passed over her lips, the same one that echoed in your memories. Even in the darkness surrounding you know, the darkness shrouding the entire universe, you were more than overjoyed to hear that laugh again. </p>",
                "content_abstract": "<p>\n<p><b><i>Carol Danvers is an alien, in a sense. She&rsquo;s grown and matured in a culture that holds emotions hostage&hellip;.and lacks education on personal space. You don&rsquo;t so much mind when she invaded your bubble, but what irks you is that she can&rsquo;t see why you blush every time she does.</i><br /></b></p>\n<figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"0\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><p>&ldquo;So, let me get this right,&rdquo; you began, pushing the button on the coffee maker as you turned to face your new guests, &ldquo;she&rsquo;s an alien from a far off planet, sent here to stop the infiltration of shapeshifting aliens? Don&rsquo;t you see the connection, Nick?&rdquo;<br /></p>\n<p>&ldquo;Well yeah, I haven&rsquo;t not thought about that but-&rdquo; Before Nick could finish, Carol, alien in question, was facing you. Her nose just barely brushed against your own as her deep brown eyes stared you down. Unlike Nick&rsquo;s eyes, that glimmered with humor even in such a dire situation, Carol&rsquo;s were almost alarmingly cold. </p>\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not here to hurt people,&rdquo; her voice mirrored her stoney expression as she spoke, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m here to end a war before more people are hurt.&rdquo; It was hard to discern whether it was Carol&rsquo;s close proximity to you or the serious glint in her eyes, but your breath caught in your throat. Warmth flooded your face to reveal a your feeling of embarrassment.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Sorry for my assumption,&rdquo; you said softly, your voice betraying you. With her so close, you could see flecks of gold in the rich brown of her irises. For an alien, she had very human, and very pretty, eyes. It was then you noticed, despite how close she was already, Carol leaned in further with furrowed brows. Her lips parted as if she were about to respond but Nick, watching the scene carry on, cleared his throat.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Are we done, cos, we got a world to save still?&rdquo; Still peering into your eyes, Carol nodded. A moment later she was standing in front of your window, gazing out across the city. You spared a glance at Nick who merely shrugged, &ldquo;maybe she likes you?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>&ldquo;When I agreed to help you, this is not what I imagined,&rdquo; you said through gritted teeth. Nick let out a laugh, nearly spilling his glass of sweet iced tea as you spun Monica around. </p>\n<p>&ldquo;Working with SHIELD comes with it&rsquo;s perks! You should reconsider my offer, Y/N, you&rsquo;d make a fine agent.&rdquo; Monica giggled as you set her feet back down on solid dirt.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not an agent?&rdquo; She asked, her brown eyes widening slightly as she added, &ldquo;But you&rsquo;re so good at fighting! You almost beat the-&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Monica!&rdquo; Maria shouted before her daughter could finish her sentence. The little girl smiled shyly, glancing over to where her mother and Carol stood on the porch. You followed her gaze, eyes locking with Carol. She looked more in her element than she did when you first met her. No longer wearing her suit, she was clad in a loose fitting shirt and jeans that, when she had first changed, made your jaw drop. You had tried your hardest not to ogle and it seemed she didn&rsquo;t notice as she continued to spout on about the Cree.</p>\n<p>Now, however, in the light of the setting Southern sun, it was hard to ignore her beauty. Even in conservation, the way she held herself was strong. It was something to admire; something about the woman that had stuck with you. You hoped that, maybe, after everything, she would stay and you could admire her some more.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Y/N?&rdquo; Nick&rsquo;s voice pulled your attention away from Carol back to the lounging form of your friend. He raised his eyebrows, gesturing towards Monica who still stood at your side.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Oh, sorry, no. No, I&rsquo;m not an agent.&rdquo; The little girl frowned, as if asking why.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Should be though,&rdquo; Nick shouted, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re wasting your potential in that stinking office.&rdquo; You were about to fire back, something mean about being able to shoot straight, but Carol beat you to the punch.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;But then she&rsquo;d have to wear one of those stupid hats, Fury,&rdquo; she joked. A smile spread against your lips, sending her a grateful glance to the woman from over your shoulder. Monica giggled before pulling on your hand to get your attention.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We could make new hats for SHIELD! Maybe then you&rsquo;ll be an agent?&rdquo; You bit your bottom lip, finding it hard to say no to the little girl before you with her wide eyes. Sighing, you glimpsed back up at Carol who, much to your surprise, was smiling too.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I guess it&rsquo;s worth a try, yeah?&rdquo; You said, bringing an impossibly large grin to Monica&rsquo;s lips. The girl cheered before taking your hand to lead you back inside the house. She raced up the steps, pulling you along and through the door. If it wasn&rsquo;t for Carol grabbing your arm, you would have been covered in glue and fabric pieces.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I actually need Y/N&rsquo;s help for minute, Lieutenant Trouble. That okay?&rdquo; Monica&rsquo;s gaze jumped from you to Carol and back again before nodding with a smile. Before you could protest, she darted into the house with Maria following after he daughter.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; You ask, turning to face the blonde. She leaned in close, much like the first time you met her, and a blush immediately rose to your cheeks. Carol&rsquo;s brows furrowed when she noticed the flush, cocking her head to the side.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Why does your face do that?&rdquo; She reached a hand up and brushed her fingers against your cheek. The touch sent a shock through you, tickling down your spine and nearly coaxed your eyes to close. Before you could, you lifted a hand to grab her wrist, pulling it away from your cheek. Somehow you managed to catch your breath enough to reply.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;You would think an advanced alien race would know what a blush is,&rdquo; you drawled, &ldquo;and how not to invade one&rsquo;s personal space.&rdquo; A smile formed on Carol&rsquo;s lips as she leaned a little closer. Another thing to admire: her daring demeanor.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not an alien, not really,&rdquo; she said, referencing her life altering revelation that had occurred a mere few hours ago. You nodded, licking your lips slightly in the hopes to distract yourself from how she had licked her own.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;re still out of this world,&rdquo; you said, nearly laughing at your own tilted attempt at flirting. However, the laugh that rang out from Carol&rsquo;s lips gave you a spark of hope. It was such a lovely sound and part of you wondered how you had gone so long without hearing it.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Smooth,&rdquo; she teased, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to remember that one.&rdquo; You let out a nervous laugh, shifting your gaze to your hands. It was then you realized you still had your fingers around her wrist. Quickly, to negate the tension, you let her go.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;So, uh, what did you need?&rdquo; You took a step back so you could more comfortably talk with her, but Carol leaned in again. That hint of joy that your joke had caused dwindled until it was replaced with a solemnity that scared you slightly. </p>\n<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re almost done with the ship,&rdquo; she said jerking her head over to where the Skrulls were working on the place she had stolen. &ldquo;When we go up there, I want you to stay behind.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Um, what? Excuse me?&rdquo; Your light hearted banter and hope died when the words sunk in. &ldquo;If Nick is going, if you&rsquo;re going, then I am too. We&rsquo;ve done too much to-&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Y/N&rdquo; she interrupted, her expression morphing from one of gravity to one of desperate earnestness. &ldquo;Please, I need to know that you&rsquo;re&hellip;that Monica is with someone capable. Maria&rsquo;s parents wouldn&rsquo;t be able to fight if something goes wrong.&rdquo; You bit the inside of your cheek, nodding until your gaze hit the floor. It made sense, but it didn&rsquo;t numb the sting.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Someone capable,&rdquo; you repeated, lifting your gaze to Carol&rsquo;s, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s all I am, yeah?&rdquo; Before she could reply or dare to close the gap between you, you stormed into the house. &ldquo;You got it, Captain,&rdquo; you shouted, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll stay put.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>-</p>\n</p>",

But a lot of the content I\u2019ve consumed hasn\u2019t really been something I wanted to write about. Although I am watching the Mission: Impossible series for the first time right now, more on that later!</p><p>However, March had some pretty big movies released in theatres including Jordan Peele\u2019s latest horror effort Us and the origin story of Marvel\u2019s Captain Marvel; and I finally picked up a PlayStation 4 again meaning I got to finish Modern Warfare Remastered after picking it up on PS Plus in March and play a couple of games of Apex: Legends for the first time. Let\u2019s talk!</p><!-- more --><hr><p><i><i></i></i></p><p><b>Us</b></p><p>Best known for his roles in comedy, Jordan Peele made a name for himself as a writer and director with <i>Get Out</i> which released to critical acclaim back in 2017. Since then, Peele served as a producer on BlacKkKlansman, is the host and producer for The Twilight Zone reboot, and released his second film, <i>Us</i>.</p><p>Without going into any spoilers, the general premise follows a family of four on a beach Vacation who are confronted by their own doppelgangers. <i>Us </i>is a very well made film that uses atmosphere and tension to invoke horror rather than rely on cheap tropes like jump scares. However, it\u2019s far from a perfect film and its plot falls apart easily when under the microscope. There\u2019s a drastic tonal shift roughly 2/3 into the movie and narrative choices that defy the rules of the world entirely, most notably the ending which left me more frustrated than excited.</p><p>The film stars Lupita Nyong'o (The Jungle Book, Black Panther) and Winston Duke (Black Panther) in leading roles as the parents, alongside Shahadi Wright Joseph (The Lion King 2019), and Evan Alex, all of which are fantastic, particularly Nyong\u2019o and Duke. Watching the pair play two drastically different roles was fascinating, particularly Nyong\u2019os doppelganger Red, who acts as the leader of the group. Overall, I still found the movie to be entertaining and would recommend watching it. I like Peele\u2019s style of film making and anticipate a bright future for the writer/director.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"720\" data-orig-width=\"1640\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/3f9150616c5b81264baca469ce1b2d6b/tumblr_inline_ppi96mfVdS1vjp3ak_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"720\" data-orig-width=\"1640\"/></figure><hr><p><i><i></i></i></p><p><b>Marvel Studio\u2019s Captain Marvel</b></p><p>Originally I planned to review Captain Marvel as I do with all Marvel films, but I\u2019ve been struggling to compile my thoughts without a second viewing and there are too many films out this month for me to see this again so soon. First and foremost, I liked Captain Marvel a lot. It\u2019s an MCU film and that guarantees a certain level of quality; it\u2019s fun, action-packed, great characters, and helps build the larger universe, where we\u2019ll see a payoff in Avengers: Endgame releasing later this month.</p><p>Captain Marvel is a prequel film that tells the origin story of the titular character Carol Danvers played by Brie Larson (Room, Kong: Skull Island). The story follows a war between two alien races known as the Kree (previously seen in Guardians of the Galaxy) and the villainous shape-shifting Skrulls, which makes its way to Earth where Carol meets a much younger Nick Fury (Samual L. Jackson), Agent Coulson (Clark Gregg), and her old friend Maria from the Air Force. The film also stars Jude Law as Carol\u2019s Kree mentor Yon-Rogg, Ben Mendelsohn as Talos the leader of the Skrull army, and Lee Pace and Djimon Hounson reprising their Guardian\u2019s roles as Ronan the Accuser and Korath respectively.</p><p>I\u2019ve always been excited about Brie Larson playing Captain Marvel, but the initial trailers made her come off as a little bland and out of place. That is certainly not the case in the film. Brie Larson is fantastic as Captain Marvel and her chemistry with Samuel L. Jackson is a lot of fun to watch. It\u2019s refreshing to see this badass female heroine and not have the focus of her story be nothing more than a love story. She\u2019s doesn\u2019t have a love interest at all and her relationships with the rest of the cast range from mentorship, to friend, partners, and family. Carol Danvers is trying to figure out who she is and what her purpose in the world is, nothing more. As far as origin stories go, there\u2019s nothing done here that\u2019s overtly original, and it feels very much like a mixture between Phase One and Phase Three MCU.</p><p>Overall, Captain Marvel is a great watch that sits somewhere in the middle of the MCU for me. It\u2019s not one of the best, but it\u2019s also not one of the worst. I think the cast is fantastic, she\u2019s a great role model for young girls to look up to, especially those that like comics and superheroes, and I\u2019m really excited to see the future of Carol Danvers now that the origin story is out of the way.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"304\" data-orig-width=\"540\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/ca18846db2fd84af455936823b9ebef2/tumblr_inline_ppi99nbXkL1vjp3ak_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"304\" data-orig-width=\"540\"/></figure><hr><p><i><i></i></i></p><p><b>Modern Warfare Remastered</b></p><p>I stopped playing Call of Duty years ago at this point; I\u2019m just not interested in playing same games year on year, especially a series that becomes increasingly more anti-consumer. But I have a strong fondness and nostalgia for the older games including the Modern Warfare trilogy and my all-time favourite, Black Ops (a game I desperately want to see given the Remastered treatment). I was really excited when MWR was first announced but I never picked it up due to a large backlog, and Activision\u2019s steep prices like reselling the DLC on a Remastered product at a higher cost than the original\u2026</p><p>In March, MWR was released for free on PlayStation Plus and was the first game I downloaded when I picked up a PS4 again after a couple of months without one. And after two weeks I\u2019ve already gotten the Platinum trophy! I had a blast going back to Modern Warfare for the first time in years. I don\u2019t think the campaign is as incredible as our memories make it out to be, but it has some fantastic moments like the mission All Ghillied Up, and characters such as Price that are later fleshed out. You can see how Modern Warfare laid the groundwork for everything we know now, and the Remastered version makes the game look and sounds fantastic. Gameplay feels a little dated, particularly the geometry as you\u2019ll find yourself getting literally caught on door frames, but it never ruined my experience.</p><p>Modern Warfare was always known for its Multiplayer and that\u2019s something I plan to keep coming back to for the foreseeable future. Multiplayer is a mixture between new school and old school gameplay; it\u2019s still very chaotic, but far simpler than more recent titles. Something as simple as having set kill streaks makes me more focussed on the objective than my streak which is refreshing. Personally, I really like the addition of new weapons and maps as well. And while the loot box system is a lot friendlier than Black Ops 4, loot is my only real problem with MWR. There are too many items for too many weapons and it takes too long to earn anything meaningful without spending money. As a new player, it\u2019s overwhelming and distracting. Whatever happened to trying to get headshots to unlock the Fall camo in MW2?</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"720\" data-orig-width=\"1280\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/1ce7f91e8d6adcef285052921b2c1d28/tumblr_inline_ppi9bgc7PJ1vjp3ak_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"720\" data-orig-width=\"1280\"/></figure><hr><p><i><i></i></i></p><p><b>Apex: Legends Impressions</b></p><p>Titanfall 2 was one of my favourite games of 2016 and easily one of the most underrated games to release that year. So when I heard Respawn Entertainment was releasing a free Battle Royale set in the Titanfall universe, I knew I had to try it out. After playing for a few hours the other night and securing my first win after three games, I\u2019ve already bought the Battle Pass.</p><p>Apex: Legends is a squad-based Battle Royale with each game featuring 20 squads of 3 fighting it out for victory. Players can choose from 9 Legend characters to play as (with more coming each season) each with their own unique play styles and abilities, think Fortnite meets Overwatch, which helps distinguish Apex from the other BR games out there. Apex looks, sounds, and plays like a Titanfall game only there\u2019s no Titans or wall running so the overall pace is slower.

Let\u2019s talk!</p>[[MORE]]<hr><p><i><i></i></i></p><p><b>Us</b></p><p>Best known for his roles in comedy, Jordan Peele made a name for himself as a writer and director with <i>Get Out</i> which released to critical acclaim back in 2017. Since then, Peele served as a producer on BlacKkKlansman, is the host and producer for The Twilight Zone reboot, and released his second film, <i>Us</i>.</p><p>Without going into any spoilers, the general premise follows a family of four on a beach Vacation who are confronted by their own doppelgangers. <i>Us </i>is a very well made film that uses atmosphere and tension to invoke horror rather than rely on cheap tropes like jump scares. However, it\u2019s far from a perfect film and its plot falls apart easily when under the microscope. There\u2019s a drastic tonal shift roughly 2/3 into the movie and narrative choices that defy the rules of the world entirely, most notably the ending which left me more frustrated than excited.</p><p>The film stars Lupita Nyong'o (The Jungle Book, Black Panther) and Winston Duke (Black Panther) in leading roles as the parents, alongside Shahadi Wright Joseph (The Lion King 2019), and Evan Alex, all of which are fantastic, particularly Nyong\u2019o and Duke. Watching the pair play two drastically different roles was fascinating, particularly Nyong\u2019os doppelganger Red, who acts as the leader of the group. Overall, I still found the movie to be entertaining and would recommend watching it. I like Peele\u2019s style of film making and anticipate a bright future for the writer/director.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"720\" data-orig-width=\"1640\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/3f9150616c5b81264baca469ce1b2d6b/tumblr_inline_ppi96mfVdS1vjp3ak_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"720\" data-orig-width=\"1640\"></figure><hr><p><i><i></i></i></p><p><b>Marvel Studio\u2019s Captain Marvel</b></p><p>Originally I planned to review Captain Marvel as I do with all Marvel films, but I\u2019ve been struggling to compile my thoughts without a second viewing and there are too many films out this month for me to see this again so soon. First and foremost, I liked Captain Marvel a lot. It\u2019s an MCU film and that guarantees a certain level of quality; it\u2019s fun, action-packed, great characters, and helps build the larger universe, where we\u2019ll see a payoff in Avengers: Endgame releasing later this month.</p><p>Captain Marvel is a prequel film that tells the origin story of the titular character Carol Danvers played by Brie Larson (Room, Kong: Skull Island). The story follows a war between two alien races known as the Kree (previously seen in Guardians of the Galaxy) and the villainous shape-shifting Skrulls, which makes its way to Earth where Carol meets a much younger Nick Fury (Samual L. Jackson), Agent Coulson (Clark Gregg), and her old friend Maria from the Air Force. The film also stars Jude Law as Carol\u2019s Kree mentor Yon-Rogg, Ben Mendelsohn as Talos the leader of the Skrull army, and Lee Pace and Djimon Hounson reprising their Guardian\u2019s roles as Ronan the Accuser and Korath respectively.</p><p>I\u2019ve always been excited about Brie Larson playing Captain Marvel, but the initial trailers made her come off as a little bland and out of place. That is certainly not the case in the film. Brie Larson is fantastic as Captain Marvel and her chemistry with Samuel L. Jackson is a lot of fun to watch. It\u2019s refreshing to see this badass female heroine and not have the focus of her story be nothing more than a love story. She\u2019s doesn\u2019t have a love interest at all and her relationships with the rest of the cast range from mentorship, to friend, partners, and family. Carol Danvers is trying to figure out who she is and what her purpose in the world is, nothing more. As far as origin stories go, there\u2019s nothing done here that\u2019s overtly original, and it feels very much like a mixture between Phase One and Phase Three MCU.</p><p>Overall, Captain Marvel is a great watch that sits somewhere in the middle of the MCU for me. It\u2019s not one of the best, but it\u2019s also not one of the worst. I think the cast is fantastic, she\u2019s a great role model for young girls to look up to, especially those that like comics and superheroes, and I\u2019m really excited to see the future of Carol Danvers now that the origin story is out of the way.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"304\" data-orig-width=\"540\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/ca18846db2fd84af455936823b9ebef2/tumblr_inline_ppi99nbXkL1vjp3ak_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"304\" data-orig-width=\"540\"></figure><hr><p><i><i></i></i></p><p><b>Modern Warfare Remastered</b></p><p>I stopped playing Call of Duty years ago at this point; I\u2019m just not interested in playing same games year on year, especially a series that becomes increasingly more anti-consumer. But I have a strong fondness and nostalgia for the older games including the Modern Warfare trilogy and my all-time favourite, Black Ops (a game I desperately want to see given the Remastered treatment). I was really excited when MWR was first announced but I never picked it up due to a large backlog, and Activision\u2019s steep prices like reselling the DLC on a Remastered product at a higher cost than the original\u2026</p><p>In March, MWR was released for free on PlayStation Plus and was the first game I downloaded when I picked up a PS4 again after a couple of months without one. And after two weeks I\u2019ve already gotten the Platinum trophy! I had a blast going back to Modern Warfare for the first time in years. I don\u2019t think the campaign is as incredible as our memories make it out to be, but it has some fantastic moments like the mission All Ghillied Up, and characters such as Price that are later fleshed out. You can see how Modern Warfare laid the groundwork for everything we know now, and the Remastered version makes the game look and sounds fantastic. Gameplay feels a little dated, particularly the geometry as you\u2019ll find yourself getting literally caught on door frames, but it never ruined my experience.</p><p>Modern Warfare was always known for its Multiplayer and that\u2019s something I plan to keep coming back to for the foreseeable future. Multiplayer is a mixture between new school and old school gameplay; it\u2019s still very chaotic, but far simpler than more recent titles. Something as simple as having set kill streaks makes me more focussed on the objective than my streak which is refreshing. Personally, I really like the addition of new weapons and maps as well. And while the loot box system is a lot friendlier than Black Ops 4, loot is my only real problem with MWR. There are too many items for too many weapons and it takes too long to earn anything meaningful without spending money. As a new player, it\u2019s overwhelming and distracting.

Since then, Peele served as a producer on BlacKkKlansman, is the host and producer for The Twilight Zone reboot, and released his second film, <i>Us</i>.</p><p>Without going into any spoilers, the general premise follows a family of four on a beach Vacation who are confronted by their own doppelgangers. <i>Us </i>is a very well made film that uses atmosphere and tension to invoke horror rather than rely on cheap tropes like jump scares. However, it&rsquo;s far from a perfect film and its plot falls apart easily when under the microscope. There&rsquo;s a drastic tonal shift roughly 2/3 into the movie and narrative choices that defy the rules of the world entirely, most notably the ending which left me more frustrated than excited.</p><p>The film stars Lupita Nyong'o (The Jungle Book, Black Panther) and Winston Duke (Black Panther) in leading roles as the parents, alongside Shahadi Wright Joseph (The Lion King 2019), and Evan Alex, all of which are fantastic, particularly Nyong&rsquo;o and Duke. Watching the pair play two drastically different roles was fascinating, particularly Nyong&rsquo;os doppelganger Red, who acts as the leader of the group. Overall, I still found the movie to be entertaining and would recommend watching it. I like Peele&rsquo;s style of film making and anticipate a bright future for the writer/director.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/3f9150616c5b81264baca469ce1b2d6b/tumblr_inline_ppi96mfVdS1vjp3ak_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><hr /><p><i><i></i></i></p><p><b>Marvel Studio&rsquo;s Captain Marvel</b></p><p>Originally I planned to review Captain Marvel as I do with all Marvel films, but I&rsquo;ve been struggling to compile my thoughts without a second viewing and there are too many films out this month for me to see this again so soon. First and foremost, I liked Captain Marvel a lot. It&rsquo;s an MCU film and that guarantees a certain level of quality; it&rsquo;s fun, action-packed, great characters, and helps build the larger universe, where we&rsquo;ll see a payoff in Avengers: Endgame releasing later this month.</p><p>Captain Marvel is a prequel film that tells the origin story of the titular character Carol Danvers played by Brie Larson (Room, Kong: Skull Island). The story follows a war between two alien races known as the Kree (previously seen in Guardians of the Galaxy) and the villainous shape-shifting Skrulls, which makes its way to Earth where Carol meets a much younger Nick Fury (Samual L. Jackson), Agent Coulson (Clark Gregg), and her old friend Maria from the Air Force. The film also stars Jude Law as Carol&rsquo;s Kree mentor Yon-Rogg, Ben Mendelsohn as Talos the leader of the Skrull army, and Lee Pace and Djimon Hounson reprising their Guardian&rsquo;s roles as Ronan the Accuser and Korath respectively.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve always been excited about Brie Larson playing Captain Marvel, but the initial trailers made her come off as a little bland and out of place. That is certainly not the case in the film. Brie Larson is fantastic as Captain Marvel and her chemistry with Samuel L. Jackson is a lot of fun to watch. It&rsquo;s refreshing to see this badass female heroine and not have the focus of her story be nothing more than a love story. She&rsquo;s doesn&rsquo;t have a love interest at all and her relationships with the rest of the cast range from mentorship, to friend, partners, and family. Carol Danvers is trying to figure out who she is and what her purpose in the world is, nothing more. As far as origin stories go, there&rsquo;s nothing done here that&rsquo;s overtly original, and it feels very much like a mixture between Phase One and Phase Three MCU.</p><p>Overall, Captain Marvel is a great watch that sits somewhere in the middle of the MCU for me. It&rsquo;s not one of the best, but it&rsquo;s also not one of the worst. I think the cast is fantastic, she&rsquo;s a great role model for young girls to look up to, especially those that like comics and superheroes, and I&rsquo;m really excited to see the future of Carol Danvers now that the origin story is out of the way.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/ca18846db2fd84af455936823b9ebef2/tumblr_inline_ppi99nbXkL1vjp3ak_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><hr /><p><i><i></i></i></p><p><b>Modern Warfare Remastered</b></p><p>I stopped playing Call of Duty years ago at this point; I&rsquo;m just not interested in playing same games year on year, especially a series that becomes increasingly more anti-consumer. But I have a strong fondness and nostalgia for the older games including the Modern Warfare trilogy and my all-time favourite, Black Ops (a game I desperately want to see given the Remastered treatment). I was really excited when MWR was first announced but I never picked it up due to a large backlog, and Activision&rsquo;s steep prices like reselling the DLC on a Remastered product at a higher cost than the original&hellip;</p><p>In March, MWR was released for free on PlayStation Plus and was the first game I downloaded when I picked up a PS4 again after a couple of months without one. And after two weeks I&rsquo;ve already gotten the Platinum trophy! I had a blast going back to Modern Warfare for the first time in years. I don&rsquo;t think the campaign is as incredible as our memories make it out to be, but it has some fantastic moments like the mission All Ghillied Up, and characters such as Price that are later fleshed out. You can see how Modern Warfare laid the groundwork for everything we know now, and the Remastered version makes the game look and sounds fantastic. Gameplay feels a little dated, particularly the geometry as you&rsquo;ll find yourself getting literally caught on door frames, but it never ruined my experience.</p><p>Modern Warfare was always known for its Multiplayer and that&rsquo;s something I plan to keep coming back to for the foreseeable future. Multiplayer is a mixture between new school and old school gameplay; it&rsquo;s still very chaotic, but far simpler than more recent titles. Something as simple as having set kill streaks makes me more focussed on the objective than my streak which is refreshing. Personally, I really like the addition of new weapons and maps as well. And while the loot box system is a lot friendlier than Black Ops 4, loot is my only real problem with MWR. There are too many items for too many weapons and it takes too long to earn anything meaningful without spending money. As a new player, it&rsquo;s overwhelming and distracting. Whatever happened to trying to get headshots to unlock the Fall camo in MW2?</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/1ce7f91e8d6adcef285052921b2c1d28/tumblr_inline_ppi9bgc7PJ1vjp3ak_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><hr /><p><i><i></i></i></p><p><b>Apex: Legends Impressions</b></p><p>Titanfall 2 was one of my favourite games of 2016 and easily one of the most underrated games to release that year. So when I heard Respawn Entertainment was releasing a free Battle Royale set in the Titanfall universe, I knew I had to try it out. After playing for a few hours the other night and securing my first win after three games, I&rsquo;ve already bought the Battle Pass.</p><p>Apex: Legends is a squad-based Battle Royale with each game featuring 20 squads of 3 fighting it out for victory. Players can choose from 9 Legend characters to play as (with more coming each season) each with their own unique play styles and abilities, think Fortnite meets Overwatch, which helps distinguish Apex from the other BR games out there. Apex looks, sounds, and plays like a Titanfall game only there&rsquo;s no Titans or wall running so the overall pace is slower. And the arsenal is taken directly from Titanfall 2 so anyone familiar with those games will feel at home pretty quickly.&nbsp;</p><p>Respawn Entertainment is a developer I like and want to see succeed because they make high-quality games that are fun to play. I also really like the Battle Pass system in Apex because it rewards hardcore players. If you reach Tier 100 and unlock all the rewards, you&rsquo;ve also unlocked enough Apex coins to buy next Battle Pass without paying anything extra. I&rsquo;m more than happy to buy the Battle Pass to support a great game that was free, and if that gets me all of the future content because I love the game and play it a lot, fantastic.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/dc4eb7aa5560af6727d0294ee3186434/tumblr_inline_ppi9dgQGw81vjp3ak_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><hr /><p><i><i>Looking for more from me?
