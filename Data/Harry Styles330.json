Nothing major reader is 20, H is about 26 (even in the previous blurbs I\u2019d say there is an age gap.) :). </p>\n\n<p>As you can see, I got <i>*slightly*</i> carried away with this request\u2014 my apologies. Regardless, please enjoy. This is my first fairly detailed smut piece. </p>\n\n<p><b>Warnings</b>: basically pure smut with a bit of fluff and some light daddy kink in the mix. Loss of virginity. Language. Not proofed. </p>\n\n<p>*      *      *<br/>\nWhen Y/N thought about losing her virginity, she never thought it would be like this. Sitting on the living room sofa in her university boyfriend\u2019s flat eating Chinese takeaway and currently in the middle of a *very* heavy petting session. </p>\n\n<p>Her hands tangled in his hair, him sitting with his back properly situated against the couch, gripping her hips and sucking at her pebbling nipples rather harshly as she straddled his waist. She wore nothing but her thin white cotton panties \u2014 so far up in subspace she couldn\u2019t even remember her real name if you asked her. No, in that moment she was only his baby love. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cDaddy, take me upstairs please. I\u2019m ready now. Want you so badly daddy.\u201d She begged nuzzling his neck and kissing his cheeks like a child. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cOh, my pretty baby. There\u2019s nothing I\u2019d love more than to do just that. But you gotta come down f\u2019me yeah? Can\u2019t have yeh this far away from me on such a special occasion. Wanna share every moment with yeh.\u201d He smiled releasing her pert nipple from his mouth with a wet pop. She simply nods and nuzzles her head in his neck sucking a love bite to the surface.</p>\n\n<p>Picking her up by her waist as she kept her legs wrapped around his hips, he made the short journey down the corridor to his bedroom. As he laid her on the bed he attempted to coax her down from the clouds a little \u2014 even if it was just the tiniest bit. He wanted his girl to remember every second of this special time in their relationship. Yes, he absolutely adores his baby love, without a doubt. But it was Y/N he fell for first. That day she\u2019d practically fell into his lap when she burst through the doors of the law seminar he was covering as part of his Masters degree. She was a meek, shy 19 year old this time last year. She barely spoke two words to anyone who wasn\u2019t her mother or her best friend. And now? Now here she was begging Harry to take her virginity on the eve of their first anniversary as a real couple, and fuck, he was such a lucky man. No girl he had ever had in the past could compare to her. His Y/N. His baby love. She was shy, but also loved to explore her kinky side. And he loved that. </p><!-- more -->\n\n<p>So, here he was pulling off his baby love\u2019s soaked panties as he brought her down from subspace. \u201cCome back t\u2019me, love. I need yeh here with me.\u201d He whispered, placing soft kisses to the inside of her thighs and making his way up toward Y/N\u2019s throbbing wet center. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cH, baby\u2026 I need you.\u201d She whimpered. Grabbing a fist full of his curly brown locks and directing him closer to her aching core. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cY/N is that you, baby? What d\u2019yeh need m\u2019love. Tell me what yeh want an yeh can have it. I\u2019ll give yeh the world, baby.\u201d H smirked looking up at her from between her long gorgeous legs. He was like Adam, waiting to feast on Eve\u2019s delicious and tempting apple. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cH, I need your mouth on me. Now, please daddy. So wet for yeh.\u201d She begs, bringing her free hand down to play with herself. H smirks as he replies. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cYour wish is my command, baby.\u201d And with that he removed his baby love\u2019s hand from her center, taking the finger that was just knuckle deep inside of herself and licking it clean before delving in for his dessert. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cMmm, yeh taste so sweet f\u2019me, love. So fuckin\u2019 delicious. Could eat yer sweet pussy for every meal.\u201d Harry moaned, licking broad stripes up and down his baby love\u2019s pretty pink cunt. \u201cSuck a pretty cunt yeh have baby love. A fuckin masterpiece, it is. Should be on display in the Louvre.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cMhm. Yes, daddy. God! Right there!\u201d She screams, twining her right hand in his hair once again and tweaking her nipples with her left hand and she arches her back off the bed. </p>\n\n<p>Harry simply moans from between her legs, creating the sweetest sensation she\u2019s ever felt. The vibrations of his moan nearly pushing her over the edge. Of course they\u2019ve done this plenty of times before. But this time, it was so raw, so passionate and intense. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cM cumming, daddy!\u201d She gasped as his tongue gave her clit one last lap. Before coming up for a breath H lapped at her juices like a starving man. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cCan I kiss you, baby?\u201d He asked, making his way up the bed from between her thighs. Y/N simply nods and leans into his lips. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cM ready for you now daddy.\u201d Y/N says reaching between their bodies to grab Harry\u2019s stiff cock and give it a few pumps. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cOkay, m\u2019love. Lemme just grab a rubber.\u201d He sighs reaching over into his nightstand drawer. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cNo daddy. Want\u2019ta feel you. \u2018M on the pill an\u2019 we\u2019ve been tested. Got nothin\u2019t worry about.\u201d She smiles, lowering herself to lay beneath him. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cOkay, m\u2019love. Know yer really wet f\u2019me but this may still hurt a bit, yeah? Let me know if yeh need to stop, kay?\u201d He questioned, kissing her lips softly before making his way between her legs again and inching his cock slowly into her warm, tight hole. </p>\n\n<p>Again, Y/N simply nods and kisses H. Letting him silently know it was okay to continue. Gasping out as he broke through her core. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cFuck. Yer so tight, love. M gonna try to go slow but yeh just feel so good. Feel like a sloppy teenager all over again.\u201d Harry groaned through gritted teeth. Taking a moment to saver the feeling of being bare inside of the woman he loves. Completely bare, with nothing to come between them, for the first time, and dare he say, hopefully forever. Knowing it wasn\u2019t just her tight wet cunt coaxing him to feel that way. </p>\n\n<p>After a few quick thrusts and some loving kisses and encouraging words, Y/N assured him it was okay to let himself go. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cS\u2019okay daddy. I already came. \u2018S yer turn.\u201d She mumbled contently rubbing her hands up and down his back. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cKnow tha\u2019 love, but you should cum, too.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay daddy. Know most girls don\u2019t the first time.\u201d She said kissing his nose. And with her permission he spent inside of her. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cLove you, daddy.\u201d She smiled as he pulled out of her. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cI love yeh, so, so much, my girl.\u201d He said returning the kiss to her nose and going to the bathroom to grab her a warm cloth to clean up. </p>\n\n<p>\u2014\u2014\u2014<br/>\nREQUESTS ARE OPEN.

And he loved that. </p>[[MORE]]\n\n<p>So, here he was pulling off his baby love\u2019s soaked panties as he brought her down from subspace. \u201cCome back t\u2019me, love. I need yeh here with me.\u201d He whispered, placing soft kisses to the inside of her thighs and making his way up toward Y/N\u2019s throbbing wet center. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cH, baby\u2026 I need you.\u201d She whimpered. Grabbing a fist full of his curly brown locks and directing him closer to her aching core. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cY/N is that you, baby? What d\u2019yeh need m\u2019love. Tell me what yeh want an yeh can have it. I\u2019ll give yeh the world, baby.\u201d H smirked looking up at her from between her long gorgeous legs. He was like Adam, waiting to feast on Eve\u2019s delicious and tempting apple. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cH, I need your mouth on me. Now, please daddy. So wet for yeh.\u201d She begs, bringing her free hand down to play with herself. H smirks as he replies. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cYour wish is my command, baby.\u201d And with that he removed his baby love\u2019s hand from her center, taking the finger that was just knuckle deep inside of herself and licking it clean before delving in for his dessert. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cMmm, yeh taste so sweet f\u2019me, love. So fuckin\u2019 delicious. Could eat yer sweet pussy for every meal.\u201d Harry moaned, licking broad stripes up and down his baby love\u2019s pretty pink cunt. \u201cSuck a pretty cunt yeh have baby love. A fuckin masterpiece, it is. Should be on display in the Louvre.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cMhm. Yes, daddy. God! Right there!\u201d She screams, twining her right hand in his hair once again and tweaking her nipples with her left hand and she arches her back off the bed. </p>\n\n<p>Harry simply moans from between her legs, creating the sweetest sensation she\u2019s ever felt. The vibrations of his moan nearly pushing her over the edge. Of course they\u2019ve done this plenty of times before. But this time, it was so raw, so passionate and intense. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cM cumming, daddy!\u201d She gasped as his tongue gave her clit one last lap. Before coming up for a breath H lapped at her juices like a starving man. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cCan I kiss you, baby?\u201d He asked, making his way up the bed from between her thighs. Y/N simply nods and leans into his lips. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cM ready for you now daddy.\u201d Y/N says reaching between their bodies to grab Harry\u2019s stiff cock and give it a few pumps. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cOkay, m\u2019love. Lemme just grab a rubber.\u201d He sighs reaching over into his nightstand drawer. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cNo daddy. Want\u2019ta feel you. \u2018M on the pill an\u2019 we\u2019ve been tested. Got nothin\u2019t worry about.\u201d She smiles, lowering herself to lay beneath him. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cOkay, m\u2019love. Know yer really wet f\u2019me but this may still hurt a bit, yeah? Let me know if yeh need to stop, kay?\u201d He questioned, kissing her lips softly before making his way between her legs again and inching his cock slowly into her warm, tight hole. </p>\n\n<p>Again, Y/N simply nods and kisses H. Letting him silently know it was okay to continue. Gasping out as he broke through her core. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cFuck. Yer so tight, love. M gonna try to go slow but yeh just feel so good. Feel like a sloppy teenager all over again.\u201d Harry groaned through gritted teeth. Taking a moment to saver the feeling of being bare inside of the woman he loves. Completely bare, with nothing to come between them, for the first time, and dare he say, hopefully forever. Knowing it wasn\u2019t just her tight wet cunt coaxing him to feel that way. </p>\n\n<p>After a few quick thrusts and some loving kisses and encouraging words, Y/N assured him it was okay to let himself go. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cS\u2019okay daddy. I already came. \u2018S yer turn.\u201d She mumbled contently rubbing her hands up and down his back. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cKnow tha\u2019 love, but you should cum, too.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay daddy. Know most girls don\u2019t the first time.\u201d She said kissing his nose. And with her permission he spent inside of her. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cLove you, daddy.\u201d She smiled as he pulled out of her. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cI love yeh, so, so much, my girl.\u201d He said returning the kiss to her nose and going to the bathroom to grab her a warm cloth to clean up. </p>\n\n<p>\u2014\u2014\u2014<br>\nREQUESTS ARE OPEN.

She\ndidn\u2019t know where she was going, but she hoped it wasn\u2019t to some fancy\nrestaurant\u2026 \u00a0She found dinner dates awkward and stuffy and that was the\nlast thing she wanted for her first date with Harry. \u00a0</p><p>London sped by and\nAnna watched as her favourite places blurred in the rearview mirror and\nwondered where she could possibly be going. She knew Harry wanted to keep\nthings quiet for now, which she totally understood, she knew how mean his fans\ncould be to girls that he was \u00a0seen with, but part of her felt like maybe\nit had something to do with Camille. </p><p>The car pulled up\noutside what Anna assumed was Harry\u2019s house and the driver shut the engine off\nand stepped outside to open the door for Harry. </p><p>\u201cThanks Howard,\u201d\nHarry said to the driver as the he closed the door behind him. \u201cHello love,\u201d he\ntook Anna\u2019s hand and placed a gentle kiss on her knuckles. </p><p>\u201cHi\u201d She blushed. </p><p>The car pulled away\nfrom the house and Anna kept her eyes fixed upon Harry. </p><p>\u201cSo, where are we\ngoing?\u201d she asked, nerves evident in her voice. </p><p>\u201cWell\u201d he smirked,\nplacing his hand over hers \u201c I might have hired out the sky garden for the\nnight\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou what?\u201d Anna\u2019s\njaw dropped. Sky Garden had always been one Anna\u2019s favourite places to go when\nshe had time to kill in london. By day it was a public park and by night it was\na rooftop event space but when she had looked into hiring it out for her\nbirthday last year she was immediately turned off by the excessive holding fee\nand she couldn\u2019t believe that Harry would spend that much on the first date. </p><p>\u201cThe sky garden\u201d\nHarry smiled </p><p>Anna threw her head\nback onto the head rest and laughed \u201cHow did you manage that? It\u2019s a Tuesday\u201d </p><p>\u201cI made friends with\nthe restaurant manager a few years ago\u201d </p><p>\u201cSo when you say you\nhired out the Sky Garden, you mean it\u2019s just us there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot quite\u201d he shook\nhis head \u201cIt\u2019s open to members only, but Rick said it will be quiet because\nit\u2019s a Tuesday\u201d </p><p>\u201cAnd most people have\nreal jobs\u201d Anna added, smiling at Harry. </p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s the blog\ngoing?\u201d Harry turned in his seat so the he was facing Anna. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve spent the\nentire day in meetings about which font I should use for the header\u201d </p><p>He began nodding his\nhead \u201cYou\u2019re fonting, that\u2019s the worst kind of admin\u201d </p><p>\u201cI never thought I\nwould care so much about a font\u201d \u00a0She giggled </p><p>\u201cNeither did I, took\nme a month to decide\u201d </p><p>\u201cThat might just be a\nworld record\u201d She nodded genuinely impressed by his dedication to his\naesthetic. </p><p>The drive from\nHarry\u2019s place to Sky Garden took them about half an hour and the conversation\nremained light hearted the entire way but Anna couldn\u2019t shake off the\nconversation she\u2019d had with Ronnie a few days ago. It felt like the elephant in\nthe room, and she wondered if he\u2019d read her blog post and if he was feeling it\ntoo. \u00a0</p><p>Silence followed them\nthrough the elevator ride to the 36th floor of the walkie talkie building and\ninto the beautiful rooftop garden. As they stepped out of the lift Harry\ngrabbed onto Anna\u2019s hand intertwining his fingers with hers and lead her\ntowards the bar. Anna had never been there at this time of the day before, it\nwas usually around midday when she came in, but right now the sun was setting\nover the London skyline and the room was illuminated in an orange glow. </p><p>\u201cSo do you take all\nyour dates here?\u201d Anna asked as they waited for the bartender </p><p>\u201cNo\u201d Harry shook his\nhead \u201cbeen a while since I\u2019ve been on a date\u201d </p><p>Now Anna knew he was\nlying and she felt her heart sink. She knew he\u2019d been on dates recently, she\u2019d\nseen it in the papers and she couldn\u2019t figure out why he would lie about that. </p><p>The bartender\napproached them and she was glad that she had an excuse to ignore his comments.\n</p><p>\u201cHarry! Long time no\nsee\u201d he offered his hand for Harry to shake \u201cwhat can I get for you?\u201d </p><p>\u201cTequila on the rocks\nfor me\u201d he smiled and turned to Anna \u201cwhat about you love?\u201d </p><p>\u201cUhh\u201d Anna thought\nfor second \u201cI\u2019ll go a white wine\u201d </p><p>\u201cPinot Grigio?\u201d he\nasked her as he pulled a bottle from the fridge</p><p>\u201cPlease\u201d she smiled\nand watched as he walked away to prepare their drinks. </p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t believe\neverything you read about me do you?\u201d Harry asked her, sensing that she hadn\u2019t\nliked his comment about dating. </p><p>\u201cNo\u201d she shook her\nhead \u201cbut I do believe what your crew members told me\u201d </p><p>He nodded his head\n\u201cEverybody has secrets right\u201d he took his first sip of his drink that the\nbartender had just handed to him.</p><p>\u201cSo you read it then\u201d\nthere was a tone of bitterness in her voice. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not keeping\nanything from you Anna\u201d his voice was soft and sincere but she was still having\ntrouble believing him. </p><p>\u201cCamille\u201d she said\nsharply as she took a sip of her wine. </p><p>\u201cAhh\u201d he sighed and\nturned around, grabbing onto her hand again \u201cthat I can explain, but let\u2019s go\nsit down\u201d </p><p>Anna followed him,\ntrying to keep a positive attitude about this whole thing because she really\nwanted there to be a second date. He lead them to the couches in the corner of\nthe room, that overlooked the skyline. </p><p>\u201cCamille\u201d he said as\nhe sat down next to her \u201cIsn\u2019t my girlfriend, despite what everyone would like\nto believe, we went on one date last year, it didn\u2019t work out, but we stayed\nfriends\u201d </p><p>\u201cBut she went on tour\nwith you?\u201d Anna was more confused than ever now </p><p>\u201cIt was a friendship\nwith a few benefits, but it\u2019s over now\u201d </p><p>\u201cOver?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo more benefits\u201d\nHarry nodded \u201cShe wanted more and I didn\u2019t so it only made sense to stop so\nthat no one gets hurt\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I thought\nyou were keeping something from me\u201d </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be \u201c Harry\nshook his head \u201cI would have thought the same\u201d </p><p>Anna breathed a sigh\nof relief. She didn\u2019t want to believe that Harry would ever cheat on someone,\nbut before now all the evidence was pointing towards that. </p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think you\nwere that guy\u201d Anna said </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not\u201d he smiled. </p><p>The conversation\nended there, Anna didn\u2019t want to ask any more questions about it, she trusted\nhis word and she knew if he wanted to tell her more about it, he would. She\ntook a sip of her wine and sat back in her chair, fixing her eyes on the view. </p><p>The rest of the night\nwas filled with almosts, almost hugs, almost kisses, a lot of stolen glances\nand some laughter.The kind of laughter that made them cry and every time Harry\nwould wipe the tears away from Anna\u2019s eyes with a gentle touch . They were both\ntreading lightly, Harry hadn\u2019t liked a girl this much in a long time and Anna\nwas still damaged from her last relationship. Dating again felt strange for\nboth of them, Anna wasn\u2019t sure she was ready to give herself to another person\nbut getting along with Harry felt easy. She didn\u2019t have to worry about what she\nlooked like when she laughed, or if her hair still looked like it did when she\nleft the house. She was comfortable and that scared her. </p><p>As the night was\ndrawing to a close, Harry wrapped his arms around her and it turned from a\nnight of almosts to a night of possibilities as she relaxed into his touch. The\nride home didn\u2019t seem to take as long, Anna was much more comfortable and Harry\nwas too. \u00a0They were snuggled into each other in the back seat of the car\ndriven by Harry\u2019s personal driver remaining quiet, content in the other\u2019s\ncompany. </p><p>\u201cComfortable silence <i>is</i>\noverrated\u201d Anna whispered with a grin spread across her face </p><p>\u201cFinally\u201d Harry\nsighed \u201csomeone who agrees with me\u201d and with that, he leant down and hovered\nhis lips over hers and she was drawn in by the simple gesture caressing his\nlips with hers reaching her hand up to cup his face. The smell of his cologne\nwas overpowering but in that moment Anna didn\u2019t care, warmth flooded her as she\nleaned into his silken lips. They could have kissed all night, but they stopped\nas the car pulled up outside Anna\u2019s flat. </p><p>\u201cThanks for a great\nnight Harry\u201d she smiled as she opened the car door </p><p>His hand was still\nrested on top of hers and he squeezed it gently before he started to speak\n\u201cI\u2019ll walk you inside love\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo\u201d Anna said as she\nbrushed her lips against his again \u201cif you get that far I won\u2019t let you leave\nand that would be breaking my rule\u201d </p><p>He nodded, catching\nher drift but placed another kiss on her lips anyway \u201cwell thank you for giving\nme a chance\u201d </p><p>\u201cHow could I not?\u201d\nshe giggled and leant in one last time, kissing him more passionately this time\n</p><p>\u201cYou better go before\nyou break your rule\u201d he chuckled and snaked his hand around her back, opening\nthe door for her. </p><p>\u201cGood night Styles\u201d\nshe said softly as she stepped out into the brisk air.</p><p>*** </p><p>April 25th </p><p>\u201cAnna, answer the\nbloody door.\u201d </p><p>Anna stirred on the\ncouch, not realising that she\u2019d fallen asleep. Batting her eyelids she sat up\nabruptly and stretched her arms out wide, adjusting to dimming afternoon light\nin her apartment. </p><p>Ronnie knocked loudly\non the door again. He hadn\u2019t heard from her for a few days, which was unusual\nfor her, normally she would send him about six texts a day but he was lucky if\nhe got a one word response and he was worried about her. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m coming\u201d she\ncalled as she stood up \u201cChill.\u201d She made her way to the door, throwing on a\njumper to make herself look a little more presentable. </p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up Ron?\u201d </p><p>He didn\u2019t answer her,\ninstead he wrapped his arms around her as if it had been months since they\u2019d\nseen each other. </p><p>\u201cI thought you were\ndead\u201d he said with his head still resting on her shoulder. </p><p>\u201cNope\u201d Anna giggled \u201cStill\nliving, I\u2019ve just been crazy busy\u201d </p><p>\u201cToo busy for your\nbest friend ay?\u201d He was joking, Anna could tell by the tone in his voice and\ntruth be told she had missed him. </p><p>\u201cNever, come in, I\nwas about to make dinner\u201d she lied, if Ronnie didn\u2019t knock on her door she\nwould still be sleeping and if she was honest she didn\u2019t even really know what\nthe time was, but she guessed it was around 8 judging by the fading light\noutside.</p><p>\u201cMmm, what are we\nhaving?\u201d he followed her through to the kitchen and watched as she opened the\nfridge which was looking mostly empty, except for a few old vegetables and a\nbottle of wine. </p><p>\u201cPizza?\u201d Anna said\nclosing the fridge \u201cI haven&rsquo;t had the chance to go shopping for a while\u201d </p><p>\u201cI can see that\u201d\nRonnie said holding up a banana that was so old it was almost black \u201cPizza\nsounds great if it means I don\u2019t have to eat this\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh come on, that\nwould make a great banana bread\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah if it doesn\u2019t\nkill you first\u201d he put it back where he got it from and searched the drawer\nwhere Anna kept her take out menus. They ordered from their favourite\nrestaurant and sat down with a glass of wine each, ready to catch up on what\nthey\u2019d missed over the last few days. Anna cleared away all the images she had\nlying on her dining table. Her blog was getting revamped and she had to choose\nthe layout, which meant that she\u2019d spent the last few days staring at different\nconcepts.</p><p>\u201cGeez he\u2019s keen\u201d\nRonnie said about five minutes after they sat down as he watched Anna\u2019s phone\nlight up with about seven messages from Harry within the span of a minute. Anna\nblushed and picked her phone up. </p><p><b><i>Morning love</i></b></p><p><b><i>I know it\u2019s not\nmorning for you </i></b></p><p><b><i>But it\u2019s morning here\n</i></b></p><p><b><i>Well kinda </i></b></p><p><b><i>It\u2019s 4am </i></b></p><p><b><i>Time zones are weird</i></b></p><p><b><i>How are you?</i></b><i> </i></p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s in Australia\u201d\nShe said putting down the phone and making a mental note to reply soon. </p><p>\u201cHow did the date\ngo?\u201d Ronnie asked, a tone of bitterness evident in his voice. </p><p>Anna had made a point\nof not telling Ronnie about it, as much as she loved him, after her last\nrelationship ended badly he got too involved in her dating life and usually\nscared them off. </p><p>\u201cWell, he\u2019s still\ntalking to me more than a week later from the other side of the world, so I\nthink it went ok\u201d </p><p>\u201cDid you kiss him?\nDid you fuck him?

Anna had had sex with one guy on\nthe first date, actually, she wouldn\u2019t even call it a date, they both knew how\nit was going to end, it wasn\u2019t long after she\u2019d broken up with her dickhead of\nan ex boyfriend who cheated on her for months before she found out and it was a\nfriend of hers so as far as she was concerned it didn\u2019t count as sex on the\nfirst date, more like a friend helping out a friend. </p><p>\u201cOk but this is Harry\nStyles so maybe your standards slipped\u201d </p><p>\u201cIf anything they\u2019re\nhigher, Don\u2019t want him to think I\u2019m easy\u201d </p><p>\u201cSo did you kiss him\nthen?\u201d </p><p>\u201cHe kissed me, once,\nwhen he dropped me home\u201d she lied again, there was more than one kiss, but\nRonnie didn\u2019t need to know that. </p><p>Ronnie nodded,\nholding himself back from making any comments \u201cAnd the girlfriend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey were friends\nwith benefits, he says it\u2019s over now\u201d </p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d </p><p>The conversation died\nand Anna picked up her phone to reply to Harry, not wanting to wait \u00a0too\nlong. </p><p><i>Good evening </i></p><p><i>I\u2019m tired if I\u2019m\nhonest, had a long day </i></p><p><i>How are you?

I\u2019ve got nothing to lose at\nthis point Ronnie, if I go with him and it works out then great, but if it\ndoesn\u2019t then fine, at least I\u2019ll have interesting content for my blog\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhatever Anna\u201d he\nsaid standing up from his seat and making his way towards the door \u201cbut don\u2019t\nignore me for months and expect me to pick up the pieces when he breaks your\nheart\u201d he slammed the door shut and left Anna standing there in silence. She\nwas used to this from Ronnie, he overreacted all the time he would calm down by\ntomorrow morning and send her an apologetic message followed by a request to\npick up his jacket on his way home from work. If she had even the slightest\ndoubts about going on tour with Harry what Ronnie had just said would have been\nenough to convince her not to go. But she had no doubts, sure, she had only\nbeen on one date with him, but she had a good feeling about it and he wouldn\u2019t\nhave asked if he didn\u2019t want her there. So, she picked up her phone again and took\na deep breath as she replied to Harry\u2019s message. </p><p><i>I\u2019d love to. x.</i></p>",

Wish me luck! </i></p><p><i>Anna. x</i></p><p>***</p>[[MORE]]<p>Anna\u2019s hands were\nshaking as she sat in the back of the car that Harry had sent for her. She\ndidn\u2019t know where she was going, but she hoped it wasn\u2019t to some fancy\nrestaurant\u2026 \u00a0She found dinner dates awkward and stuffy and that was the\nlast thing she wanted for her first date with Harry. \u00a0</p><p>London sped by and\nAnna watched as her favourite places blurred in the rearview mirror and\nwondered where she could possibly be going. She knew Harry wanted to keep\nthings quiet for now, which she totally understood, she knew how mean his fans\ncould be to girls that he was \u00a0seen with, but part of her felt like maybe\nit had something to do with Camille. </p><p>The car pulled up\noutside what Anna assumed was Harry\u2019s house and the driver shut the engine off\nand stepped outside to open the door for Harry. </p><p>\u201cThanks Howard,\u201d\nHarry said to the driver as the he closed the door behind him. \u201cHello love,\u201d he\ntook Anna\u2019s hand and placed a gentle kiss on her knuckles. </p><p>\u201cHi\u201d She blushed. </p><p>The car pulled away\nfrom the house and Anna kept her eyes fixed upon Harry. </p><p>\u201cSo, where are we\ngoing?\u201d she asked, nerves evident in her voice. </p><p>\u201cWell\u201d he smirked,\nplacing his hand over hers \u201c I might have hired out the sky garden for the\nnight\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou what?\u201d Anna\u2019s\njaw dropped. Sky Garden had always been one Anna\u2019s favourite places to go when\nshe had time to kill in london. By day it was a public park and by night it was\na rooftop event space but when she had looked into hiring it out for her\nbirthday last year she was immediately turned off by the excessive holding fee\nand she couldn\u2019t believe that Harry would spend that much on the first date. </p><p>\u201cThe sky garden\u201d\nHarry smiled </p><p>Anna threw her head\nback onto the head rest and laughed \u201cHow did you manage that? It\u2019s a Tuesday\u201d </p><p>\u201cI made friends with\nthe restaurant manager a few years ago\u201d </p><p>\u201cSo when you say you\nhired out the Sky Garden, you mean it\u2019s just us there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot quite\u201d he shook\nhis head \u201cIt\u2019s open to members only, but Rick said it will be quiet because\nit\u2019s a Tuesday\u201d </p><p>\u201cAnd most people have\nreal jobs\u201d Anna added, smiling at Harry. </p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s the blog\ngoing?\u201d Harry turned in his seat so the he was facing Anna. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve spent the\nentire day in meetings about which font I should use for the header\u201d </p><p>He began nodding his\nhead \u201cYou\u2019re fonting, that\u2019s the worst kind of admin\u201d </p><p>\u201cI never thought I\nwould care so much about a font\u201d \u00a0She giggled </p><p>\u201cNeither did I, took\nme a month to decide\u201d </p><p>\u201cThat might just be a\nworld record\u201d She nodded genuinely impressed by his dedication to his\naesthetic. </p><p>The drive from\nHarry\u2019s place to Sky Garden took them about half an hour and the conversation\nremained light hearted the entire way but Anna couldn\u2019t shake off the\nconversation she\u2019d had with Ronnie a few days ago. It felt like the elephant in\nthe room, and she wondered if he\u2019d read her blog post and if he was feeling it\ntoo. \u00a0</p><p>Silence followed them\nthrough the elevator ride to the 36th floor of the walkie talkie building and\ninto the beautiful rooftop garden. As they stepped out of the lift Harry\ngrabbed onto Anna\u2019s hand intertwining his fingers with hers and lead her\ntowards the bar. Anna had never been there at this time of the day before, it\nwas usually around midday when she came in, but right now the sun was setting\nover the London skyline and the room was illuminated in an orange glow. </p><p>\u201cSo do you take all\nyour dates here?\u201d Anna asked as they waited for the bartender </p><p>\u201cNo\u201d Harry shook his\nhead \u201cbeen a while since I\u2019ve been on a date\u201d </p><p>Now Anna knew he was\nlying and she felt her heart sink. She knew he\u2019d been on dates recently, she\u2019d\nseen it in the papers and she couldn\u2019t figure out why he would lie about that. </p><p>The bartender\napproached them and she was glad that she had an excuse to ignore his comments.\n</p><p>\u201cHarry! Long time no\nsee\u201d he offered his hand for Harry to shake \u201cwhat can I get for you?\u201d </p><p>\u201cTequila on the rocks\nfor me\u201d he smiled and turned to Anna \u201cwhat about you love?\u201d </p><p>\u201cUhh\u201d Anna thought\nfor second \u201cI\u2019ll go a white wine\u201d </p><p>\u201cPinot Grigio?\u201d he\nasked her as he pulled a bottle from the fridge</p><p>\u201cPlease\u201d she smiled\nand watched as he walked away to prepare their drinks. </p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t believe\neverything you read about me do you?\u201d Harry asked her, sensing that she hadn\u2019t\nliked his comment about dating. </p><p>\u201cNo\u201d she shook her\nhead \u201cbut I do believe what your crew members told me\u201d </p><p>He nodded his head\n\u201cEverybody has secrets right\u201d he took his first sip of his drink that the\nbartender had just handed to him.</p><p>\u201cSo you read it then\u201d\nthere was a tone of bitterness in her voice. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not keeping\nanything from you Anna\u201d his voice was soft and sincere but she was still having\ntrouble believing him. </p><p>\u201cCamille\u201d she said\nsharply as she took a sip of her wine. </p><p>\u201cAhh\u201d he sighed and\nturned around, grabbing onto her hand again \u201cthat I can explain, but let\u2019s go\nsit down\u201d </p><p>Anna followed him,\ntrying to keep a positive attitude about this whole thing because she really\nwanted there to be a second date. He lead them to the couches in the corner of\nthe room, that overlooked the skyline. </p><p>\u201cCamille\u201d he said as\nhe sat down next to her \u201cIsn\u2019t my girlfriend, despite what everyone would like\nto believe, we went on one date last year, it didn\u2019t work out, but we stayed\nfriends\u201d </p><p>\u201cBut she went on tour\nwith you?\u201d Anna was more confused than ever now </p><p>\u201cIt was a friendship\nwith a few benefits, but it\u2019s over now\u201d </p><p>\u201cOver?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo more benefits\u201d\nHarry nodded \u201cShe wanted more and I didn\u2019t so it only made sense to stop so\nthat no one gets hurt\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I thought\nyou were keeping something from me\u201d </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be \u201c Harry\nshook his head \u201cI would have thought the same\u201d </p><p>Anna breathed a sigh\nof relief. She didn\u2019t want to believe that Harry would ever cheat on someone,\nbut before now all the evidence was pointing towards that. </p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think you\nwere that guy\u201d Anna said </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not\u201d he smiled. </p><p>The conversation\nended there, Anna didn\u2019t want to ask any more questions about it, she trusted\nhis word and she knew if he wanted to tell her more about it, he would. She\ntook a sip of her wine and sat back in her chair, fixing her eyes on the view. </p><p>The rest of the night\nwas filled with almosts, almost hugs, almost kisses, a lot of stolen glances\nand some laughter.The kind of laughter that made them cry and every time Harry\nwould wipe the tears away from Anna\u2019s eyes with a gentle touch . They were both\ntreading lightly, Harry hadn\u2019t liked a girl this much in a long time and Anna\nwas still damaged from her last relationship. Dating again felt strange for\nboth of them, Anna wasn\u2019t sure she was ready to give herself to another person\nbut getting along with Harry felt easy. She didn\u2019t have to worry about what she\nlooked like when she laughed, or if her hair still looked like it did when she\nleft the house. She was comfortable and that scared her. </p><p>As the night was\ndrawing to a close, Harry wrapped his arms around her and it turned from a\nnight of almosts to a night of possibilities as she relaxed into his touch. The\nride home didn\u2019t seem to take as long, Anna was much more comfortable and Harry\nwas too. \u00a0They were snuggled into each other in the back seat of the car\ndriven by Harry\u2019s personal driver remaining quiet, content in the other\u2019s\ncompany. </p><p>\u201cComfortable silence <i>is</i>\noverrated\u201d Anna whispered with a grin spread across her face </p><p>\u201cFinally\u201d Harry\nsighed \u201csomeone who agrees with me\u201d and with that, he leant down and hovered\nhis lips over hers and she was drawn in by the simple gesture caressing his\nlips with hers reaching her hand up to cup his face. The smell of his cologne\nwas overpowering but in that moment Anna didn\u2019t care, warmth flooded her as she\nleaned into his silken lips. They could have kissed all night, but they stopped\nas the car pulled up outside Anna\u2019s flat. </p><p>\u201cThanks for a great\nnight Harry\u201d she smiled as she opened the car door </p><p>His hand was still\nrested on top of hers and he squeezed it gently before he started to speak\n\u201cI\u2019ll walk you inside love\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo\u201d Anna said as she\nbrushed her lips against his again \u201cif you get that far I won\u2019t let you leave\nand that would be breaking my rule\u201d </p><p>He nodded, catching\nher drift but placed another kiss on her lips anyway \u201cwell thank you for giving\nme a chance\u201d </p><p>\u201cHow could I not?\u201d\nshe giggled and leant in one last time, kissing him more passionately this time\n</p><p>\u201cYou better go before\nyou break your rule\u201d he chuckled and snaked his hand around her back, opening\nthe door for her. </p><p>\u201cGood night Styles\u201d\nshe said softly as she stepped out into the brisk air.</p><p>*** </p><p>April 25th </p><p>\u201cAnna, answer the\nbloody door.\u201d </p><p>Anna stirred on the\ncouch, not realising that she\u2019d fallen asleep. Batting her eyelids she sat up\nabruptly and stretched her arms out wide, adjusting to dimming afternoon light\nin her apartment. </p><p>Ronnie knocked loudly\non the door again. He hadn\u2019t heard from her for a few days, which was unusual\nfor her, normally she would send him about six texts a day but he was lucky if\nhe got a one word response and he was worried about her. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m coming\u201d she\ncalled as she stood up \u201cChill.\u201d She made her way to the door, throwing on a\njumper to make herself look a little more presentable. </p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up Ron?\u201d </p><p>He didn\u2019t answer her,\ninstead he wrapped his arms around her as if it had been months since they\u2019d\nseen each other. </p><p>\u201cI thought you were\ndead\u201d he said with his head still resting on her shoulder. </p><p>\u201cNope\u201d Anna giggled \u201cStill\nliving, I\u2019ve just been crazy busy\u201d </p><p>\u201cToo busy for your\nbest friend ay?\u201d He was joking, Anna could tell by the tone in his voice and\ntruth be told she had missed him. </p><p>\u201cNever, come in, I\nwas about to make dinner\u201d she lied, if Ronnie didn\u2019t knock on her door she\nwould still be sleeping and if she was honest she didn\u2019t even really know what\nthe time was, but she guessed it was around 8 judging by the fading light\noutside.</p><p>\u201cMmm, what are we\nhaving?\u201d he followed her through to the kitchen and watched as she opened the\nfridge which was looking mostly empty, except for a few old vegetables and a\nbottle of wine. </p><p>\u201cPizza?\u201d Anna said\nclosing the fridge \u201cI haven\u2019t had the chance to go shopping for a while\u201d </p><p>\u201cI can see that\u201d\nRonnie said holding up a banana that was so old it was almost black \u201cPizza\nsounds great if it means I don\u2019t have to eat this\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh come on, that\nwould make a great banana bread\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah if it doesn\u2019t\nkill you first\u201d he put it back where he got it from and searched the drawer\nwhere Anna kept her take out menus. They ordered from their favourite\nrestaurant and sat down with a glass of wine each, ready to catch up on what\nthey\u2019d missed over the last few days. Anna cleared away all the images she had\nlying on her dining table. Her blog was getting revamped and she had to choose\nthe layout, which meant that she\u2019d spent the last few days staring at different\nconcepts.</p><p>\u201cGeez he\u2019s keen\u201d\nRonnie said about five minutes after they sat down as he watched Anna\u2019s phone\nlight up with about seven messages from Harry within the span of a minute. Anna\nblushed and picked her phone up. </p><p><b><i>Morning love</i></b></p><p><b><i>I know it\u2019s not\nmorning for you </i></b></p><p><b><i>But it\u2019s morning here\n</i></b></p><p><b><i>Well kinda </i></b></p><p><b><i>It\u2019s 4am </i></b></p><p><b><i>Time zones are weird</i></b></p><p><b><i>How are you?</i></b><i> </i></p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s in Australia\u201d\nShe said putting down the phone and making a mental note to reply soon. </p><p>\u201cHow did the date\ngo?\u201d Ronnie asked, a tone of bitterness evident in his voice. </p><p>Anna had made a point\nof not telling Ronnie about it, as much as she loved him, after her last\nrelationship ended badly he got too involved in her dating life and usually\nscared them off. </p><p>\u201cWell, he\u2019s still\ntalking to me more than a week later from the other side of the world, so I\nthink it went ok\u201d </p><p>\u201cDid you kiss him?\nDid you fuck him? What about the other girl?\u201d Ronnie had a habit of asking\ninvasive questions all at once to play it off as a bit of fun, but Anna knew\nwhat he was doing. </p><p>\u201cRon\u201d Anna sighed\n\u201cYou\u2019re prying again\u201d </p><p>\u201cAnswer my questions\nand I\u2019ll change the subject\u201d </p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t have sex,\nit was the first date, you know I don\u2019t do that\u201d She was annoyed that he would\neven ask her that. </p><p>\u201cExcept for that one\ntime that you did\u201d Ronnie took a sip of his wine and a smug smile stretched\nacross his face. </p><p>\u201cThat was different,\nI knew him well before that\u201d She wasn\u2019t lying. Anna had had sex with one guy on\nthe first date, actually, she wouldn\u2019t even call it a date, they both knew how\nit was going to end, it wasn\u2019t long after she\u2019d broken up with her dickhead of\nan ex boyfriend who cheated on her for months before she found out and it was a\nfriend of hers so as far as she was concerned it didn\u2019t count as sex on the\nfirst date, more like a friend helping out a friend. </p><p>\u201cOk but this is Harry\nStyles so maybe your standards slipped\u201d </p><p>\u201cIf anything they\u2019re\nhigher, Don\u2019t want him to think I\u2019m easy\u201d </p><p>\u201cSo did you kiss him\nthen?\u201d </p><p>\u201cHe kissed me, once,\nwhen he dropped me home\u201d she lied again, there was more than one kiss, but\nRonnie didn\u2019t need to know that. </p><p>Ronnie nodded,\nholding himself back from making any comments \u201cAnd the girlfriend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey were friends\nwith benefits, he says it\u2019s over now\u201d </p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d </p><p>The conversation died\nand Anna picked up her phone to reply to Harry, not wanting to wait \u00a0too\nlong. </p><p><i>Good evening </i></p><p><i>I\u2019m tired if I\u2019m\nhonest, had a long day </i></p><p><i>How are you? Got a\nshow today?</i></p><p>Ronnie didn\u2019t try to\nmake more conversation he simply sat on Anna\u2019s couch sipping his wine, waiting\nfor the pizza to arrive and when it did, he was the first to make a move to\nanswer the door. </p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on with\nyou Ron?\u201d Anna broke the silence \u201cany ladies?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou know I don\u2019t\ndate \u201c He said bluntly taking his first bite of pizza</p><p>\u201cAlright, sorry\u201d She\nrolled her eyes and picked up her buzzing phone again </p><p><b><i>Not today, making my\nway to Sydney for tomorrow\u2019s show. </i></b></p><p><b><i>What\u2019s been keeping\nyou so busy? </i></b></p><p><i>Just work, revamping\nthe blog takes time </i></p><p><i>Sydney sounds fun,\nI\u2019ve always wanted to go there </i></p><p><b><i>The harbour\u2019s nice,\nbut I can\u2019t say I\u2019ve seen much of the city otherwise, I don\u2019t get to go out\nmuch </i></b></p><p><b><i>I have a question for\nyou </i></b></p><p><i>I might have an\nanswer </i></p><p><b><i>I know it\u2019s a lot to\nask so if you don\u2019t want to I\u2019ll totally understand </i></b></p><p><b><i>But I really like you\nAnna and I want to spend more time with you, so, I was wondering if you wanted\nto come on tour with me in the US?</i></b></p><p>Anna read Harry\u2019s\nlast message and her jaw dropped causing Ronnie to look up from his own phone. </p><p>\u201cWhat did he say?\u201d he\nwas suddenly interested again. </p><p>\u201cHe..he\u201d Anna\ncouldn\u2019t quite comprehend what she\u2019d just been asked</p><p>\u201cHe what, spit it out\nAn\u201d </p><p>\u201cHe wants me to go on\ntour with him\u201d </p><p>Ronnie\u2019s nostrils\nflared and he gently placed his plate full of pizza down on the coffee table\n\u201cAnna you can\u2019t, you just met the dude\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt does feel sudden\u201d\nshe admitted, although there wasn\u2019t a bone in her body that didn\u2019t want to\nstart packing her bags already. </p><p>\u201cSudden!\u201d Ronnie\nexclaimed \u201cit\u2019s mental, you\u2019ve been on one date\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like I\u2019d be\ntravelling with just him, you saw how big his crew is\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah, because he\ntravels with the sound guys\u201d he said sarcastically \u201cdon\u2019t be daft Anna, there\u2019s\nno way he goes around with the crew, he\u2019d be on private jets while they\u2019re in\neconomy\u201d </p><p>\u201cLook I don\u2019t know if\nhe does that or not, but it\u2019s beside the point. I\u2019ve got nothing to lose at\nthis point Ronnie, if I go with him and it works out then great, but if it\ndoesn\u2019t then fine, at least I\u2019ll have interesting content for my blog\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhatever Anna\u201d he\nsaid standing up from his seat and making his way towards the door \u201cbut don\u2019t\nignore me for months and expect me to pick up the pieces when he breaks your\nheart\u201d he slammed the door shut and left Anna standing there in silence. She\nwas used to this from Ronnie, he overreacted all the time he would calm down by\ntomorrow morning and send her an apologetic message followed by a request to\npick up his jacket on his way home from work. If she had even the slightest\ndoubts about going on tour with Harry what Ronnie had just said would have been\nenough to convince her not to go. But she had no doubts, sure, she had only\nbeen on one date with him, but she had a good feeling about it and he wouldn\u2019t\nhave asked if he didn\u2019t want her there. So, she picked up her phone again and took\na deep breath as she replied to Harry\u2019s message. </p><p><i>I\u2019d love to. x.</i></p></p>",

Wish me luck! </i></p><p><i>Anna. x</i></p><p>***</p>[[MORE]]<p>Anna\u2019s hands were\nshaking as she sat in the back of the car that Harry had sent for her. She\ndidn\u2019t know where she was going, but she hoped it wasn\u2019t to some fancy\nrestaurant\u2026 \u00a0She found dinner dates awkward and stuffy and that was the\nlast thing she wanted for her first date with Harry. \u00a0</p><p>London sped by and\nAnna watched as her favourite places blurred in the rearview mirror and\nwondered where she could possibly be going. She knew Harry wanted to keep\nthings quiet for now, which she totally understood, she knew how mean his fans\ncould be to girls that he was \u00a0seen with, but part of her felt like maybe\nit had something to do with Camille. </p><p>The car pulled up\noutside what Anna assumed was Harry\u2019s house and the driver shut the engine off\nand stepped outside to open the door for Harry. </p><p>\u201cThanks Howard,\u201d\nHarry said to the driver as the he closed the door behind him. \u201cHello love,\u201d he\ntook Anna\u2019s hand and placed a gentle kiss on her knuckles. </p><p>\u201cHi\u201d She blushed. </p><p>The car pulled away\nfrom the house and Anna kept her eyes fixed upon Harry. </p><p>\u201cSo, where are we\ngoing?\u201d she asked, nerves evident in her voice. </p><p>\u201cWell\u201d he smirked,\nplacing his hand over hers \u201c I might have hired out the sky garden for the\nnight\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou what?\u201d Anna\u2019s\njaw dropped. Sky Garden had always been one Anna\u2019s favourite places to go when\nshe had time to kill in london. By day it was a public park and by night it was\na rooftop event space but when she had looked into hiring it out for her\nbirthday last year she was immediately turned off by the excessive holding fee\nand she couldn\u2019t believe that Harry would spend that much on the first date. </p><p>\u201cThe sky garden\u201d\nHarry smiled </p><p>Anna threw her head\nback onto the head rest and laughed \u201cHow did you manage that? It\u2019s a Tuesday\u201d </p><p>\u201cI made friends with\nthe restaurant manager a few years ago\u201d </p><p>\u201cSo when you say you\nhired out the Sky Garden, you mean it\u2019s just us there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot quite\u201d he shook\nhis head \u201cIt\u2019s open to members only, but Rick said it will be quiet because\nit\u2019s a Tuesday\u201d </p><p>\u201cAnd most people have\nreal jobs\u201d Anna added, smiling at Harry. </p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s the blog\ngoing?\u201d Harry turned in his seat so the he was facing Anna. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve spent the\nentire day in meetings about which font I should use for the header\u201d </p><p>He began nodding his\nhead \u201cYou\u2019re fonting, that\u2019s the worst kind of admin\u201d </p><p>\u201cI never thought I\nwould care so much about a font\u201d \u00a0She giggled </p><p>\u201cNeither did I, took\nme a month to decide\u201d </p><p>\u201cThat might just be a\nworld record\u201d She nodded genuinely impressed by his dedication to his\naesthetic. </p><p>The drive from\nHarry\u2019s place to Sky Garden took them about half an hour and the conversation\nremained light hearted the entire way but Anna couldn\u2019t shake off the\nconversation she\u2019d had with Ronnie a few days ago. It felt like the elephant in\nthe room, and she wondered if he\u2019d read her blog post and if he was feeling it\ntoo. \u00a0</p><p>Silence followed them\nthrough the elevator ride to the 36th floor of the walkie talkie building and\ninto the beautiful rooftop garden. As they stepped out of the lift Harry\ngrabbed onto Anna\u2019s hand intertwining his fingers with hers and lead her\ntowards the bar. Anna had never been there at this time of the day before, it\nwas usually around midday when she came in, but right now the sun was setting\nover the London skyline and the room was illuminated in an orange glow. </p><p>\u201cSo do you take all\nyour dates here?\u201d Anna asked as they waited for the bartender </p><p>\u201cNo\u201d Harry shook his\nhead \u201cbeen a while since I\u2019ve been on a date\u201d </p><p>Now Anna knew he was\nlying and she felt her heart sink. She knew he\u2019d been on dates recently, she\u2019d\nseen it in the papers and she couldn\u2019t figure out why he would lie about that. </p><p>The bartender\napproached them and she was glad that she had an excuse to ignore his comments.\n</p><p>\u201cHarry! Long time no\nsee\u201d he offered his hand for Harry to shake \u201cwhat can I get for you?\u201d </p><p>\u201cTequila on the rocks\nfor me\u201d he smiled and turned to Anna \u201cwhat about you love?\u201d </p><p>\u201cUhh\u201d Anna thought\nfor second \u201cI\u2019ll go a white wine\u201d </p><p>\u201cPinot Grigio?\u201d he\nasked her as he pulled a bottle from the fridge</p><p>\u201cPlease\u201d she smiled\nand watched as he walked away to prepare their drinks. </p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t believe\neverything you read about me do you?\u201d Harry asked her, sensing that she hadn\u2019t\nliked his comment about dating. </p><p>\u201cNo\u201d she shook her\nhead \u201cbut I do believe what your crew members told me\u201d </p><p>He nodded his head\n\u201cEverybody has secrets right\u201d he took his first sip of his drink that the\nbartender had just handed to him.</p><p>\u201cSo you read it then\u201d\nthere was a tone of bitterness in her voice. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not keeping\nanything from you Anna\u201d his voice was soft and sincere but she was still having\ntrouble believing him. </p><p>\u201cCamille\u201d she said\nsharply as she took a sip of her wine. </p><p>\u201cAhh\u201d he sighed and\nturned around, grabbing onto her hand again \u201cthat I can explain, but let\u2019s go\nsit down\u201d </p><p>Anna followed him,\ntrying to keep a positive attitude about this whole thing because she really\nwanted there to be a second date. He lead them to the couches in the corner of\nthe room, that overlooked the skyline. </p><p>\u201cCamille\u201d he said as\nhe sat down next to her \u201cIsn\u2019t my girlfriend, despite what everyone would like\nto believe, we went on one date last year, it didn\u2019t work out, but we stayed\nfriends\u201d </p><p>\u201cBut she went on tour\nwith you?\u201d Anna was more confused than ever now </p><p>\u201cIt was a friendship\nwith a few benefits, but it\u2019s over now\u201d </p><p>\u201cOver?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo more benefits\u201d\nHarry nodded \u201cShe wanted more and I didn\u2019t so it only made sense to stop so\nthat no one gets hurt\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I thought\nyou were keeping something from me\u201d </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be \u201c Harry\nshook his head \u201cI would have thought the same\u201d </p><p>Anna breathed a sigh\nof relief. She didn\u2019t want to believe that Harry would ever cheat on someone,\nbut before now all the evidence was pointing towards that. </p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think you\nwere that guy\u201d Anna said </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not\u201d he smiled. </p><p>The conversation\nended there, Anna didn\u2019t want to ask any more questions about it, she trusted\nhis word and she knew if he wanted to tell her more about it, he would. She\ntook a sip of her wine and sat back in her chair, fixing her eyes on the view. </p><p>The rest of the night\nwas filled with almosts, almost hugs, almost kisses, a lot of stolen glances\nand some laughter.The kind of laughter that made them cry and every time Harry\nwould wipe the tears away from Anna\u2019s eyes with a gentle touch . They were both\ntreading lightly, Harry hadn\u2019t liked a girl this much in a long time and Anna\nwas still damaged from her last relationship. Dating again felt strange for\nboth of them, Anna wasn\u2019t sure she was ready to give herself to another person\nbut getting along with Harry felt easy. She didn\u2019t have to worry about what she\nlooked like when she laughed, or if her hair still looked like it did when she\nleft the house. She was comfortable and that scared her. </p><p>As the night was\ndrawing to a close, Harry wrapped his arms around her and it turned from a\nnight of almosts to a night of possibilities as she relaxed into his touch. The\nride home didn\u2019t seem to take as long, Anna was much more comfortable and Harry\nwas too. \u00a0They were snuggled into each other in the back seat of the car\ndriven by Harry\u2019s personal driver remaining quiet, content in the other\u2019s\ncompany. </p><p>\u201cComfortable silence <i>is</i>\noverrated\u201d Anna whispered with a grin spread across her face </p><p>\u201cFinally\u201d Harry\nsighed \u201csomeone who agrees with me\u201d and with that, he leant down and hovered\nhis lips over hers and she was drawn in by the simple gesture caressing his\nlips with hers reaching her hand up to cup his face. The smell of his cologne\nwas overpowering but in that moment Anna didn\u2019t care, warmth flooded her as she\nleaned into his silken lips. They could have kissed all night, but they stopped\nas the car pulled up outside Anna\u2019s flat. </p><p>\u201cThanks for a great\nnight Harry\u201d she smiled as she opened the car door </p><p>His hand was still\nrested on top of hers and he squeezed it gently before he started to speak\n\u201cI\u2019ll walk you inside love\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo\u201d Anna said as she\nbrushed her lips against his again \u201cif you get that far I won\u2019t let you leave\nand that would be breaking my rule\u201d </p><p>He nodded, catching\nher drift but placed another kiss on her lips anyway \u201cwell thank you for giving\nme a chance\u201d </p><p>\u201cHow could I not?\u201d\nshe giggled and leant in one last time, kissing him more passionately this time\n</p><p>\u201cYou better go before\nyou break your rule\u201d he chuckled and snaked his hand around her back, opening\nthe door for her. </p><p>\u201cGood night Styles\u201d\nshe said softly as she stepped out into the brisk air.</p><p>*** </p><p>April 25th </p><p>\u201cAnna, answer the\nbloody door.\u201d </p><p>Anna stirred on the\ncouch, not realising that she\u2019d fallen asleep. Batting her eyelids she sat up\nabruptly and stretched her arms out wide, adjusting to dimming afternoon light\nin her apartment. </p><p>Ronnie knocked loudly\non the door again. He hadn\u2019t heard from her for a few days, which was unusual\nfor her, normally she would send him about six texts a day but he was lucky if\nhe got a one word response and he was worried about her. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m coming\u201d she\ncalled as she stood up \u201cChill.\u201d She made her way to the door, throwing on a\njumper to make herself look a little more presentable. </p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up Ron?\u201d </p><p>He didn\u2019t answer her,\ninstead he wrapped his arms around her as if it had been months since they\u2019d\nseen each other. </p><p>\u201cI thought you were\ndead\u201d he said with his head still resting on her shoulder. </p><p>\u201cNope\u201d Anna giggled \u201cStill\nliving, I\u2019ve just been crazy busy\u201d </p><p>\u201cToo busy for your\nbest friend ay?\u201d He was joking, Anna could tell by the tone in his voice and\ntruth be told she had missed him. </p><p>\u201cNever, come in, I\nwas about to make dinner\u201d she lied, if Ronnie didn\u2019t knock on her door she\nwould still be sleeping and if she was honest she didn\u2019t even really know what\nthe time was, but she guessed it was around 8 judging by the fading light\noutside.</p><p>\u201cMmm, what are we\nhaving?\u201d he followed her through to the kitchen and watched as she opened the\nfridge which was looking mostly empty, except for a few old vegetables and a\nbottle of wine. </p><p>\u201cPizza?\u201d Anna said\nclosing the fridge \u201cI haven\u2019t had the chance to go shopping for a while\u201d </p><p>\u201cI can see that\u201d\nRonnie said holding up a banana that was so old it was almost black \u201cPizza\nsounds great if it means I don\u2019t have to eat this\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh come on, that\nwould make a great banana bread\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah if it doesn\u2019t\nkill you first\u201d he put it back where he got it from and searched the drawer\nwhere Anna kept her take out menus. They ordered from their favourite\nrestaurant and sat down with a glass of wine each, ready to catch up on what\nthey\u2019d missed over the last few days. Anna cleared away all the images she had\nlying on her dining table. Her blog was getting revamped and she had to choose\nthe layout, which meant that she\u2019d spent the last few days staring at different\nconcepts.</p><p>\u201cGeez he\u2019s keen\u201d\nRonnie said about five minutes after they sat down as he watched Anna\u2019s phone\nlight up with about seven messages from Harry within the span of a minute. Anna\nblushed and picked her phone up. </p><p><b><i>Morning love</i></b></p><p><b><i>I know it\u2019s not\nmorning for you </i></b></p><p><b><i>But it\u2019s morning here\n</i></b></p><p><b><i>Well kinda </i></b></p><p><b><i>It\u2019s 4am </i></b></p><p><b><i>Time zones are weird</i></b></p><p><b><i>How are you?</i></b><i> </i></p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s in Australia\u201d\nShe said putting down the phone and making a mental note to reply soon. </p><p>\u201cHow did the date\ngo?\u201d Ronnie asked, a tone of bitterness evident in his voice. </p><p>Anna had made a point\nof not telling Ronnie about it, as much as she loved him, after her last\nrelationship ended badly he got too involved in her dating life and usually\nscared them off. </p><p>\u201cWell, he\u2019s still\ntalking to me more than a week later from the other side of the world, so I\nthink it went ok\u201d </p><p>\u201cDid you kiss him?\nDid you fuck him? What about the other girl?\u201d Ronnie had a habit of asking\ninvasive questions all at once to play it off as a bit of fun, but Anna knew\nwhat he was doing. </p><p>\u201cRon\u201d Anna sighed\n\u201cYou\u2019re prying again\u201d </p><p>\u201cAnswer my questions\nand I\u2019ll change the subject\u201d </p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t have sex,\nit was the first date, you know I don\u2019t do that\u201d She was annoyed that he would\neven ask her that. </p><p>\u201cExcept for that one\ntime that you did\u201d Ronnie took a sip of his wine and a smug smile stretched\nacross his face. </p><p>\u201cThat was different,\nI knew him well before that\u201d She wasn\u2019t lying. Anna had had sex with one guy on\nthe first date, actually, she wouldn\u2019t even call it a date, they both knew how\nit was going to end, it wasn\u2019t long after she\u2019d broken up with her dickhead of\nan ex boyfriend who cheated on her for months before she found out and it was a\nfriend of hers so as far as she was concerned it didn\u2019t count as sex on the\nfirst date, more like a friend helping out a friend. </p><p>\u201cOk but this is Harry\nStyles so maybe your standards slipped\u201d </p><p>\u201cIf anything they\u2019re\nhigher, Don\u2019t want him to think I\u2019m easy\u201d </p><p>\u201cSo did you kiss him\nthen?\u201d </p><p>\u201cHe kissed me, once,\nwhen he dropped me home\u201d she lied again, there was more than one kiss, but\nRonnie didn\u2019t need to know that. </p><p>Ronnie nodded,\nholding himself back from making any comments \u201cAnd the girlfriend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey were friends\nwith benefits, he says it\u2019s over now\u201d </p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d </p><p>The conversation died\nand Anna picked up her phone to reply to Harry, not wanting to wait \u00a0too\nlong. </p><p><i>Good evening </i></p><p><i>I\u2019m tired if I\u2019m\nhonest, had a long day </i></p><p><i>How are you?

I\u2019ve got nothing to lose at\nthis point Ronnie, if I go with him and it works out then great, but if it\ndoesn\u2019t then fine, at least I\u2019ll have interesting content for my blog\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhatever Anna\u201d he\nsaid standing up from his seat and making his way towards the door \u201cbut don\u2019t\nignore me for months and expect me to pick up the pieces when he breaks your\nheart\u201d he slammed the door shut and left Anna standing there in silence. She\nwas used to this from Ronnie, he overreacted all the time he would calm down by\ntomorrow morning and send her an apologetic message followed by a request to\npick up his jacket on his way home from work. If she had even the slightest\ndoubts about going on tour with Harry what Ronnie had just said would have been\nenough to convince her not to go. But she had no doubts, sure, she had only\nbeen on one date with him, but she had a good feeling about it and he wouldn\u2019t\nhave asked if he didn\u2019t want her there. So, she picked up her phone again and took\na deep breath as she replied to Harry\u2019s message. </p><p><i>I\u2019d love to. x.</i></p></p>",

She\ndidn&rsquo;t know where she was going, but she hoped it wasn&rsquo;t to some fancy\nrestaurant&hellip; &nbsp;She found dinner dates awkward and stuffy and that was the\nlast thing she wanted for her first date with Harry. &nbsp;</p><p>London sped by and\nAnna watched as her favourite places blurred in the rearview mirror and\nwondered where she could possibly be going. She knew Harry wanted to keep\nthings quiet for now, which she totally understood, she knew how mean his fans\ncould be to girls that he was &nbsp;seen with, but part of her felt like maybe\nit had something to do with Camille. </p><p>The car pulled up\noutside what Anna assumed was Harry&rsquo;s house and the driver shut the engine off\nand stepped outside to open the door for Harry. </p><p>&ldquo;Thanks Howard,&rdquo;\nHarry said to the driver as the he closed the door behind him. &ldquo;Hello love,&rdquo; he\ntook Anna&rsquo;s hand and placed a gentle kiss on her knuckles. </p><p>&ldquo;Hi&rdquo; She blushed. </p><p>The car pulled away\nfrom the house and Anna kept her eyes fixed upon Harry. </p><p>&ldquo;So, where are we\ngoing?&rdquo; she asked, nerves evident in her voice. </p><p>&ldquo;Well&rdquo; he smirked,\nplacing his hand over hers &ldquo; I might have hired out the sky garden for the\nnight&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;You what?&rdquo; Anna&rsquo;s\njaw dropped. Sky Garden had always been one Anna&rsquo;s favourite places to go when\nshe had time to kill in london. By day it was a public park and by night it was\na rooftop event space but when she had looked into hiring it out for her\nbirthday last year she was immediately turned off by the excessive holding fee\nand she couldn&rsquo;t believe that Harry would spend that much on the first date. </p><p>&ldquo;The sky garden&rdquo;\nHarry smiled </p><p>Anna threw her head\nback onto the head rest and laughed &ldquo;How did you manage that? It&rsquo;s a Tuesday&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I made friends with\nthe restaurant manager a few years ago&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;So when you say you\nhired out the Sky Garden, you mean it&rsquo;s just us there?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not quite&rdquo; he shook\nhis head &ldquo;It&rsquo;s open to members only, but Rick said it will be quiet because\nit&rsquo;s a Tuesday&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;And most people have\nreal jobs&rdquo; Anna added, smiling at Harry. </p><p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s the blog\ngoing?&rdquo; Harry turned in his seat so the he was facing Anna. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve spent the\nentire day in meetings about which font I should use for the header&rdquo; </p><p>He began nodding his\nhead &ldquo;You&rsquo;re fonting, that&rsquo;s the worst kind of admin&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I never thought I\nwould care so much about a font&rdquo; &nbsp;She giggled </p><p>&ldquo;Neither did I, took\nme a month to decide&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;That might just be a\nworld record&rdquo; She nodded genuinely impressed by his dedication to his\naesthetic. </p><p>The drive from\nHarry&rsquo;s place to Sky Garden took them about half an hour and the conversation\nremained light hearted the entire way but Anna couldn&rsquo;t shake off the\nconversation she&rsquo;d had with Ronnie a few days ago. It felt like the elephant in\nthe room, and she wondered if he&rsquo;d read her blog post and if he was feeling it\ntoo. &nbsp;</p><p>Silence followed them\nthrough the elevator ride to the 36th floor of the walkie talkie building and\ninto the beautiful rooftop garden. As they stepped out of the lift Harry\ngrabbed onto Anna&rsquo;s hand intertwining his fingers with hers and lead her\ntowards the bar. Anna had never been there at this time of the day before, it\nwas usually around midday when she came in, but right now the sun was setting\nover the London skyline and the room was illuminated in an orange glow. </p><p>&ldquo;So do you take all\nyour dates here?&rdquo; Anna asked as they waited for the bartender </p><p>&ldquo;No&rdquo; Harry shook his\nhead &ldquo;been a while since I&rsquo;ve been on a date&rdquo; </p><p>Now Anna knew he was\nlying and she felt her heart sink. She knew he&rsquo;d been on dates recently, she&rsquo;d\nseen it in the papers and she couldn&rsquo;t figure out why he would lie about that. </p><p>The bartender\napproached them and she was glad that she had an excuse to ignore his comments.\n</p><p>&ldquo;Harry! Long time no\nsee&rdquo; he offered his hand for Harry to shake &ldquo;what can I get for you?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Tequila on the rocks\nfor me&rdquo; he smiled and turned to Anna &ldquo;what about you love?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Uhh&rdquo; Anna thought\nfor second &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go a white wine&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Pinot Grigio?&rdquo; he\nasked her as he pulled a bottle from the fridge</p><p>&ldquo;Please&rdquo; she smiled\nand watched as he walked away to prepare their drinks. </p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t believe\neverything you read about me do you?&rdquo; Harry asked her, sensing that she hadn&rsquo;t\nliked his comment about dating. </p><p>&ldquo;No&rdquo; she shook her\nhead &ldquo;but I do believe what your crew members told me&rdquo; </p><p>He nodded his head\n&ldquo;Everybody has secrets right&rdquo; he took his first sip of his drink that the\nbartender had just handed to him.</p><p>&ldquo;So you read it then&rdquo;\nthere was a tone of bitterness in her voice. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not keeping\nanything from you Anna&rdquo; his voice was soft and sincere but she was still having\ntrouble believing him. </p><p>&ldquo;Camille&rdquo; she said\nsharply as she took a sip of her wine. </p><p>&ldquo;Ahh&rdquo; he sighed and\nturned around, grabbing onto her hand again &ldquo;that I can explain, but let&rsquo;s go\nsit down&rdquo; </p><p>Anna followed him,\ntrying to keep a positive attitude about this whole thing because she really\nwanted there to be a second date. He lead them to the couches in the corner of\nthe room, that overlooked the skyline. </p><p>&ldquo;Camille&rdquo; he said as\nhe sat down next to her &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t my girlfriend, despite what everyone would like\nto believe, we went on one date last year, it didn&rsquo;t work out, but we stayed\nfriends&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;But she went on tour\nwith you?&rdquo; Anna was more confused than ever now </p><p>&ldquo;It was a friendship\nwith a few benefits, but it&rsquo;s over now&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Over?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;No more benefits&rdquo;\nHarry nodded &ldquo;She wanted more and I didn&rsquo;t so it only made sense to stop so\nthat no one gets hurt&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry I thought\nyou were keeping something from me&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be &ldquo; Harry\nshook his head &ldquo;I would have thought the same&rdquo; </p><p>Anna breathed a sigh\nof relief. She didn&rsquo;t want to believe that Harry would ever cheat on someone,\nbut before now all the evidence was pointing towards that. </p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think you\nwere that guy&rdquo; Anna said </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not&rdquo; he smiled. </p><p>The conversation\nended there, Anna didn&rsquo;t want to ask any more questions about it, she trusted\nhis word and she knew if he wanted to tell her more about it, he would. She\ntook a sip of her wine and sat back in her chair, fixing her eyes on the view. </p><p>The rest of the night\nwas filled with almosts, almost hugs, almost kisses, a lot of stolen glances\nand some laughter.The kind of laughter that made them cry and every time Harry\nwould wipe the tears away from Anna&rsquo;s eyes with a gentle touch . They were both\ntreading lightly, Harry hadn&rsquo;t liked a girl this much in a long time and Anna\nwas still damaged from her last relationship. Dating again felt strange for\nboth of them, Anna wasn&rsquo;t sure she was ready to give herself to another person\nbut getting along with Harry felt easy. She didn&rsquo;t have to worry about what she\nlooked like when she laughed, or if her hair still looked like it did when she\nleft the house. She was comfortable and that scared her. </p><p>As the night was\ndrawing to a close, Harry wrapped his arms around her and it turned from a\nnight of almosts to a night of possibilities as she relaxed into his touch. The\nride home didn&rsquo;t seem to take as long, Anna was much more comfortable and Harry\nwas too. &nbsp;They were snuggled into each other in the back seat of the car\ndriven by Harry&rsquo;s personal driver remaining quiet, content in the other&rsquo;s\ncompany. </p><p>&ldquo;Comfortable silence <i>is</i>\noverrated&rdquo; Anna whispered with a grin spread across her face </p><p>&ldquo;Finally&rdquo; Harry\nsighed &ldquo;someone who agrees with me&rdquo; and with that, he leant down and hovered\nhis lips over hers and she was drawn in by the simple gesture caressing his\nlips with hers reaching her hand up to cup his face. The smell of his cologne\nwas overpowering but in that moment Anna didn&rsquo;t care, warmth flooded her as she\nleaned into his silken lips. They could have kissed all night, but they stopped\nas the car pulled up outside Anna&rsquo;s flat. </p><p>&ldquo;Thanks for a great\nnight Harry&rdquo; she smiled as she opened the car door </p><p>His hand was still\nrested on top of hers and he squeezed it gently before he started to speak\n&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll walk you inside love&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;No&rdquo; Anna said as she\nbrushed her lips against his again &ldquo;if you get that far I won&rsquo;t let you leave\nand that would be breaking my rule&rdquo; </p><p>He nodded, catching\nher drift but placed another kiss on her lips anyway &ldquo;well thank you for giving\nme a chance&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;How could I not?&rdquo;\nshe giggled and leant in one last time, kissing him more passionately this time\n</p><p>&ldquo;You better go before\nyou break your rule&rdquo; he chuckled and snaked his hand around her back, opening\nthe door for her. </p><p>&ldquo;Good night Styles&rdquo;\nshe said softly as she stepped out into the brisk air.</p><p>*** </p><p>April 25th </p><p>&ldquo;Anna, answer the\nbloody door.&rdquo; </p><p>Anna stirred on the\ncouch, not realising that she&rsquo;d fallen asleep. Batting her eyelids she sat up\nabruptly and stretched her arms out wide, adjusting to dimming afternoon light\nin her apartment. </p><p>Ronnie knocked loudly\non the door again. He hadn&rsquo;t heard from her for a few days, which was unusual\nfor her, normally she would send him about six texts a day but he was lucky if\nhe got a one word response and he was worried about her. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m coming&rdquo; she\ncalled as she stood up &ldquo;Chill.&rdquo; She made her way to the door, throwing on a\njumper to make herself look a little more presentable. </p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up Ron?&rdquo; </p><p>He didn&rsquo;t answer her,\ninstead he wrapped his arms around her as if it had been months since they&rsquo;d\nseen each other. </p><p>&ldquo;I thought you were\ndead&rdquo; he said with his head still resting on her shoulder. </p><p>&ldquo;Nope&rdquo; Anna giggled &ldquo;Still\nliving, I&rsquo;ve just been crazy busy&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Too busy for your\nbest friend ay?&rdquo; He was joking, Anna could tell by the tone in his voice and\ntruth be told she had missed him. </p><p>&ldquo;Never, come in, I\nwas about to make dinner&rdquo; she lied, if Ronnie didn&rsquo;t knock on her door she\nwould still be sleeping and if she was honest she didn&rsquo;t even really know what\nthe time was, but she guessed it was around 8 judging by the fading light\noutside.</p><p>&ldquo;Mmm, what are we\nhaving?&rdquo; he followed her through to the kitchen and watched as she opened the\nfridge which was looking mostly empty, except for a few old vegetables and a\nbottle of wine. </p><p>&ldquo;Pizza?&rdquo; Anna said\nclosing the fridge &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t had the chance to go shopping for a while&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I can see that&rdquo;\nRonnie said holding up a banana that was so old it was almost black &ldquo;Pizza\nsounds great if it means I don&rsquo;t have to eat this&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Oh come on, that\nwould make a great banana bread&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah if it doesn&rsquo;t\nkill you first&rdquo; he put it back where he got it from and searched the drawer\nwhere Anna kept her take out menus. They ordered from their favourite\nrestaurant and sat down with a glass of wine each, ready to catch up on what\nthey&rsquo;d missed over the last few days. Anna cleared away all the images she had\nlying on her dining table. Her blog was getting revamped and she had to choose\nthe layout, which meant that she&rsquo;d spent the last few days staring at different\nconcepts.</p><p>&ldquo;Geez he&rsquo;s keen&rdquo;\nRonnie said about five minutes after they sat down as he watched Anna&rsquo;s phone\nlight up with about seven messages from Harry within the span of a minute. Anna\nblushed and picked her phone up. </p><p><b><i>Morning love</i></b></p><p><b><i>I know it&rsquo;s not\nmorning for you </i></b></p><p><b><i>But it&rsquo;s morning here\n</i></b></p><p><b><i>Well kinda </i></b></p><p><b><i>It&rsquo;s 4am </i></b></p><p><b><i>Time zones are weird</i></b></p><p><b><i>How are you?</i></b><i> </i></p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s in Australia&rdquo;\nShe said putting down the phone and making a mental note to reply soon. </p><p>&ldquo;How did the date\ngo?&rdquo; Ronnie asked, a tone of bitterness evident in his voice. </p><p>Anna had made a point\nof not telling Ronnie about it, as much as she loved him, after her last\nrelationship ended badly he got too involved in her dating life and usually\nscared them off. </p><p>&ldquo;Well, he&rsquo;s still\ntalking to me more than a week later from the other side of the world, so I\nthink it went ok&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Did you kiss him?\nDid you fuck him? What about the other girl?&rdquo; Ronnie had a habit of asking\ninvasive questions all at once to play it off as a bit of fun, but Anna knew\nwhat he was doing. </p><p>&ldquo;Ron&rdquo; Anna sighed\n&ldquo;You&rsquo;re prying again&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Answer my questions\nand I&rsquo;ll change the subject&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t have sex,\nit was the first date, you know I don&rsquo;t do that&rdquo; She was annoyed that he would\neven ask her that. </p><p>&ldquo;Except for that one\ntime that you did&rdquo; Ronnie took a sip of his wine and a smug smile stretched\nacross his face. </p><p>&ldquo;That was different,\nI knew him well before that&rdquo; She wasn&rsquo;t lying. Anna had had sex with one guy on\nthe first date, actually, she wouldn&rsquo;t even call it a date, they both knew how\nit was going to end, it wasn&rsquo;t long after she&rsquo;d broken up with her dickhead of\nan ex boyfriend who cheated on her for months before she found out and it was a\nfriend of hers so as far as she was concerned it didn&rsquo;t count as sex on the\nfirst date, more like a friend helping out a friend. </p><p>&ldquo;Ok but this is Harry\nStyles so maybe your standards slipped&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;If anything they&rsquo;re\nhigher, Don&rsquo;t want him to think I&rsquo;m easy&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;So did you kiss him\nthen?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;He kissed me, once,\nwhen he dropped me home&rdquo; she lied again, there was more than one kiss, but\nRonnie didn&rsquo;t need to know that. </p><p>Ronnie nodded,\nholding himself back from making any comments &ldquo;And the girlfriend?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;They were friends\nwith benefits, he says it&rsquo;s over now&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Good.&rdquo; </p><p>The conversation died\nand Anna picked up her phone to reply to Harry, not wanting to wait &nbsp;too\nlong. </p><p><i>Good evening </i></p><p><i>I&rsquo;m tired if I&rsquo;m\nhonest, had a long day </i></p><p><i>How are you? Got a\nshow today?</i></p><p>Ronnie didn&rsquo;t try to\nmake more conversation he simply sat on Anna&rsquo;s couch sipping his wine, waiting\nfor the pizza to arrive and when it did, he was the first to make a move to\nanswer the door. </p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on with\nyou Ron?&rdquo; Anna broke the silence &ldquo;any ladies?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;You know I don&rsquo;t\ndate &ldquo; He said bluntly taking his first bite of pizza</p><p>&ldquo;Alright, sorry&rdquo; She\nrolled her eyes and picked up her buzzing phone again </p><p><b><i>Not today, making my\nway to Sydney for tomorrow&rsquo;s show. </i></b></p><p><b><i>What&rsquo;s been keeping\nyou so busy? </i></b></p><p><i>Just work, revamping\nthe blog takes time </i></p><p><i>Sydney sounds fun,\nI&rsquo;ve always wanted to go there </i></p><p><b><i>The harbour&rsquo;s nice,\nbut I can&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;ve seen much of the city otherwise, I don&rsquo;t get to go out\nmuch </i></b></p><p><b><i>I have a question for\nyou </i></b></p><p><i>I might have an\nanswer </i></p><p><b><i>I know it&rsquo;s a lot to\nask so if you don&rsquo;t want to I&rsquo;ll totally understand </i></b></p><p><b><i>But I really like you\nAnna and I want to spend more time with you, so, I was wondering if you wanted\nto come on tour with me in the US?</i></b></p><p>Anna read Harry&rsquo;s\nlast message and her jaw dropped causing Ronnie to look up from his own phone. </p><p>&ldquo;What did he say?&rdquo; he\nwas suddenly interested again. </p><p>&ldquo;He..he&rdquo; Anna\ncouldn&rsquo;t quite comprehend what she&rsquo;d just been asked</p><p>&ldquo;He what, spit it out\nAn&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;He wants me to go on\ntour with him&rdquo; </p><p>Ronnie&rsquo;s nostrils\nflared and he gently placed his plate full of pizza down on the coffee table\n&ldquo;Anna you can&rsquo;t, you just met the dude&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;It does feel sudden&rdquo;\nshe admitted, although there wasn&rsquo;t a bone in her body that didn&rsquo;t want to\nstart packing her bags already. </p><p>&ldquo;Sudden!&rdquo; Ronnie\nexclaimed &ldquo;it&rsquo;s mental, you&rsquo;ve been on one date&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not like I&rsquo;d be\ntravelling with just him, you saw how big his crew is&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, because he\ntravels with the sound guys&rdquo; he said sarcastically &ldquo;don&rsquo;t be daft Anna, there&rsquo;s\nno way he goes around with the crew, he&rsquo;d be on private jets while they&rsquo;re in\neconomy&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Look I don&rsquo;t know if\nhe does that or not, but it&rsquo;s beside the point. I&rsquo;ve got nothing to lose at\nthis point Ronnie, if I go with him and it works out then great, but if it\ndoesn&rsquo;t then fine, at least I&rsquo;ll have interesting content for my blog&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Whatever Anna&rdquo; he\nsaid standing up from his seat and making his way towards the door &ldquo;but don&rsquo;t\nignore me for months and expect me to pick up the pieces when he breaks your\nheart&rdquo; he slammed the door shut and left Anna standing there in silence. She\nwas used to this from Ronnie, he overreacted all the time he would calm down by\ntomorrow morning and send her an apologetic message followed by a request to\npick up his jacket on his way home from work. If she had even the slightest\ndoubts about going on tour with Harry what Ronnie had just said would have been\nenough to convince her not to go. But she had no doubts, sure, she had only\nbeen on one date with him, but she had a good feeling about it and he wouldn&rsquo;t\nhave asked if he didn&rsquo;t want her there. So, she picked up her phone again and took\na deep breath as she replied to Harry&rsquo;s message. </p><p><i>I&rsquo;d love to. x.</i></p></p>",

If\nyou have to change yourself to impress the person you&rsquo;re on &nbsp;a date with\nthen they&rsquo;re not the right person to be dating. Don&rsquo;t pretend to like music you\ndon&rsquo;t, or shy away from sharing your interests because you&rsquo;re afraid they won&rsquo;t\nlike them. If you have to pretend to be someone you&rsquo;re not on the first date,\nthe second and third probably aren&rsquo;t going to go so well.</i></p>\n<p><b><i>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n</i></b><b><i>Wear what makes you feel your best.</i></b><i> <b></b></i></p>\n<p><i>If that means wearing\nshorts and a t-shirt then that&rsquo;s what it means, if you feel confident in what\nyou&rsquo;re wearing, then you&rsquo;ll feel more confident in general. Wear something\nthat&rsquo;s appropriate for what you&rsquo;re doing, and if you&rsquo;re as clumsy as I am,\ndon&rsquo;t wear heels, unless you want to fall flat on your face and embarrass\nyourself in front of your date. </i></p>\n<p><b><i>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n</i></b><b><i>Don&rsquo;t use your phone the whole time </i></b></p>\n<p><i>If you&rsquo;re going to be\nstaring at your phone the whole time you might as well be at home. Look up,\nmake conversation, go back to your online life when you get home. </i></p>\n<p><b><i>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n</i></b><b><i>Relax </i></b></p>\n<p><i>This isn&rsquo;t a job\ninterview, your date is probably just as nervous, take a few deep breaths and\nrelax into yourself. It&rsquo;s natural to feel feel nervous but just remember not to\nput too much pressure on yourself, this is a first date, if you don&rsquo;t like them\nyou can leave, it&rsquo;s not the end of the world. </i></p>\n<p><b><i>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n</i></b><b><i>Don&rsquo;t force it </i></b></p>\n<p><i>If it&rsquo;s not meant to\nbe, it&rsquo;s not meant to be. Go in with a positive attitude, this could be the\nlove of your life, but they also might not be. Don&rsquo;t go in thinking it&rsquo;s going to\nbe terrible, but don&rsquo;t put too much pressure on you or your date, take it one\nstep at a time, focus on the date and try to enjoy yourself, but if you don&rsquo;t,\nit&rsquo;s no big deal. There are plenty of other fish in the sea. </i></p>\n<p><i>That dating game is\nbrutal, I&rsquo;ve been on my fair share of first dates over the years, some of them\nwonderful, some of them horrible, all of them learning experiences, but watch\nme ignore all of my own advice when I go on a date tonight.
