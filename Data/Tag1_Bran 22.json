        "answer": "<p>Thanks, anon!</p><p>There are a few reasons for the Night\u2019s King tale (though GRRM has said that he won\u2019t be a returning character as he is in the show, so that isn\u2019t one of them): one is for the general tone of the chapter it comes up in, another for some context surrounding the Others. I also think there are some vitally important hints in his story, though.</p><p>Here\u2019s the passage for reference:</p><blockquote><p>The gathering gloom put Bran in mind of another of Old Nan\u2019s stories, the tale of Night\u2019s King. He had been the thirteenth man to lead the Night\u2019s Watch, she said; a warrior who knew no fear. <b>\u201cAnd that was the fault in him,\u201d she would add, \u201cfor all men must know fear.\u201d</b> A woman was his downfall; a woman glimpsed from atop the Wall, with skin as white as the moon and eyes like blue stars. Fearing nothing, he chased her and caught her and loved her, though her skin was cold as ice, and when he gave his seed to her he gave his soul as well. \u00a0 \u00a0</p><p>He brought her back to the Nightfort and proclaimed her a queen and himself her king, and <b>with strange sorceries he bound his Sworn Brothers to his will.</b> For thirteen years they had ruled, Night\u2019s King and his corpse queen, till finally the Stark of Winterfell and Joramun of the wildlings had joined to free the Watch from bondage. After his fall, when it was found he had been sacrificing to the Others, all records of Night\u2019s King had been destroyed, his very name forbidden.<br/></p><p>\u201cSome say he was a Bolton,\u201d Old Nan would always end. \u201cSome say a Magnar out of Skagos, some say Umber, Flint, or Norrey. Some would have you think he was a Woodfoot, from them who ruled Bear Island before the ironmen came. <b>He never was. He was a Stark, the brother of the man who brought him down.\u201d</b> She always pinched Bran on the nose then, he would never forget it. \u201cHe was a Stark of Winterfell, and who can say? <b>Mayhaps his name was Brandon.</b> Mayhaps he slept in this very bed in this very room.\u201d (Bran IV, <i>ASOS</i>)<br/></p></blockquote><p>The Night\u2019s King\u2019s relevance is to Bran. The mention of fear and its necessity echoes back to the iconic exchange between Ned and Bran (<i>\u201cCan a man still be brave is he\u2019s afraid?\u201d\u00a0\u201cThat is the only time a man can be brave.\u201d</i>) Old Nan takes the connection even further when she tells Bran that the Night\u2019s King was a Stark, something especially significant when we-the-readers have been wired into the Starks being the series\u2019 official good guys (or as close as <i>ASOIAF</i> gets).</p><p>Even if Old Nan is pulling this part out of thin air, the point she makes stands: everyone has good and evil inside of them, something Bran struggles with in <i>ADWD</i> as he continues to skinchange into Hodor despite the warnings. The magic Bran is learning is <i>dangerous</i>, and the moral implications of using it need to be kept in mind.</p><p>Which also, I think, echoes back to Bran\u2019s suggested predecessor. The tale of the Night\u2019s King is relevant not only as a warning to what Bran may be capable of, but also a purposeful parallel to what we\u2019re discovering about Euron Greyjoy.</p><p>While Bran is in danger, walking the line between right and wrong, Euron\u2019s ten miles over it. He has no qualms murdering, and even less about possessing people with skills he likely learned from the Three-Eyed Crow (but that\u2019s another post). Based on Aeron\u2019s <i>TWOW</i> excerpt chapter, Euron\u2019s goal is nothing short of being the new Night\u2019s King, a new, twisted sort of god.

Reed Exhibitions Africa and ReedPOP announced the latest addition to the talent roll today with the news that the King of Kings Landing would be appearing for two days at Comic Con Africa 2019. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Viewers around the world were recently locked to their screens as Bran the Broken became the Lord of the 6 Kingdoms and protector of the realm in the season finale of Game of Thrones.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Isaac Hempstead Wright first came to our screens when he landed the coveted role of Bran Stark back in 2011. Since then he has been a pivotal character throughout the series, but few people could have foreseen him being made king, except for the three-eyed raven himself. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Game of Thrones set a massive ratings record for the season 8 finale, with over 19 million viewers. This record-breaking stat makes it the biggest telecast in HBO\u2019s history and the most-watched scripted entertainment programme of 2019. According to the Workforce Institute at Kronos, it was estimated that over 10 million Americans would skip work the morning after the finale. With the Lord of the 6 Kingdoms visiting Comic Con Africa in September, we expect productivity in workplaces across the country to dip significantly. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Game of Thrones fans can expect to see Isaac on main stage panel discussions as well as photo and autograph signings.

Reed Exhibitions Africa and ReedPOP announced the latest addition to the talent roll today with the news that the King of Kings Landing would be appearing for two days at Comic Con Africa 2019. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Viewers around the world were recently locked to their screens as Bran the Broken became the Lord of the 6 Kingdoms and protector of the realm in the season finale of Game of Thrones.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Isaac Hempstead Wright first came to our screens when he landed the coveted role of Bran Stark back in 2011. Since then he has been a pivotal character throughout the series, but few people could have foreseen him being made king, except for the three-eyed raven himself. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Game of Thrones set a massive ratings record for the season 8 finale, with over 19 million viewers. This record-breaking stat makes it the biggest telecast in HBO&rsquo;s history and the most-watched scripted entertainment programme of 2019. According to the Workforce Institute at Kronos, it was estimated that over 10 million Americans would skip work the morning after the finale. With the Lord of the 6 Kingdoms visiting Comic Con Africa in September, we expect productivity in workplaces across the country to dip significantly. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Game of Thrones fans can expect to see Isaac on main stage panel discussions as well as photo and autograph signings. Details and pricing will be made public in due course.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Isaac can also be seen in John Crowley&rsquo;s Closed Circuit for Working Title and The Awakening for StudioCanal.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://ges-sa.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Isaac-Hempstead-Wright_Social-Website.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"external-image-wrapper\" data-loading-text=\"Loading...\" data-src=\"denied:data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAP///wAAACwAAAAAAQABAEACAkQBADs=\">External image</div><div class=\"external-image-wrapper\" data-loading-text=\"Loading...\" data-src=\"https://ges-sa.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Isaac-Hempstead-Wright_Social-Website.jpg\">External image</div></a></figure><p>Comic Con Africa will be held from 21 &ndash; 24 September 2019, at Gallagher Convention Centre in Johannesburg.
