Ellie had thought that the arrival of Scott and his boyfriend on Friday night had been the extent of the surprise for the weekend. Then Chris had had his niece and nephews reveal, last night, that the whole family was going to the Red Sox game that afternoon.</p><p>The next surprise came that morning, when a party bus rolled up in front of the house to take them all to the baseball game. Once the kids&rsquo; carseats had been installed, they&rsquo;d loaded up and headed for Fenway park and the private box that Chris had rented for their group.</p><p>Despite the dismal weather upon arriving at the ballpark, they&rsquo;d explored Yawkey Way and taken part in the&nbsp;&ldquo;Walk in the Park&rdquo; event before they&rsquo;d headed up to their seats. Tommy had been passed around to different family members while they waited for the game to start, but ultimately ended up in his daddy&rsquo;s arms where he&rsquo;d promptly been lulled to sleep despite the sounds around him.</p><p>Tommy didn&rsquo;t wake up until the eighth inning and by then the Red Sox had a firm hold on the game. Ellie watched the remainder of the game from the inside portion of their private box and had the baby fed and changed by the time the rest of the family was ready to go.</p><p>&ldquo;So was your first Mother&rsquo;s Day a success?&rdquo; Chris asked as they walked towards the party bus.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;It was the best I&rsquo;ve ever had,&rdquo; Ellie replied with a laugh.&nbsp;&ldquo;Not sure how you&rsquo;ll top this one.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t underestimate me,&rdquo; Chris told her.&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a few tricks up my sleeves. And in a few years, Tommy will be able to help, too.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I look forward to it,&rdquo; Ellie replied, honestly.<br /></p>",

Being a new kid her junior year coupled with social anxiety had made school a hellish experience. She couldn\u2019t fault her parents for moving to the community. It was nice and clean and safe and quiet. Most people were friendly. She just hadn\u2019t fit in.</p><p>\tShe\u2019d begged off the five-year reunion. She had other plans, I\u2019m sorry. The ten-year reunion she worked. She couldn\u2019t remember getting an invite to their fifteen year and she really wasn\u2019t for sure there had been one. Twenty years seemed safe to go. Right? None of them would remember her anyway. Right? If things got too awkward, she could just leave. Riiiiiiiiiiiight.</p><!-- more --><p>\tSo here she was. Dressed in a flirty, flowing light pink dress and sandals with her hair in soft curls, pretending like she belonged. She sipped her drink, rum, pineapple and Redbull. Ok, she sipped her fourth drink. It didn\u2019t help with the itching in her brain that told her no one wanted her here. Her anxiety flipped back and forth between telling her that everyone was ignoring her to everyone was staring at her.</p><p>\t\u201cHi?\u201d</p><p>\tShe turned slowly to the female voice. \u201cHi?\u201d</p><p>\tThe brunette smiled. \u201cI thought that was you. We were bio lab partners senior year.\u201d Her face pinched as she tried to remember. She\u2019d brain-dumped everyone from the last 2 years of high school. Except one person that she\u2019d yet to see. \u201cI had braces and really bad acne. Still have the glasses though.\u201d</p><p>\tShe gasped and her eyes widened. \u201cMeg!\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cYeah!\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cHow are you doing? You look great.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cMarried, baby number two on the way.\u201d She wiggled her ring finger then rubbed her belly. \u201cIt\u2019s Megan Metlzer now though.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cYou married Mr. Metlzer the student teacher?\u201d She remembered them giggling over the hot nerd student teacher.</p><p>\t\u201cYeah, yeah.\u201d She nodded and sipped her soda. \u201cWe ran into each other after graduation.\u201d She rolled her eyes at herself and shook her head. \u201cSorry, that sounds so clich\u00e9.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cIt\u2019s ok.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cI don\u2019t want you to think he did anything inappropriate.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cI didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cHis senior year was my freshman year. We happened to have a class together. And it just bloomed from there.\u201d She shrugged.</p><p>\t\u201cThat\u2019s great. I\u2019m really happy for you, Meg.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cSo, what about you?\u201d Meg nudged her arm. \u201cMarried? Kids? Pets?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cNah, I work a lot. And I enjoy my quiet time.\u201d She sipped her drink only to find it empty.</p><p>\t\u201cThat\u2019s a shame. I always thought you and Chris would eventually hook up, ya know?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cWhat-what makes you say that?\u201d Megan shrugged. \u201cI need refill.\u201d She waved her glass. \u201cI\u2019ll be right back.\u201d No, she wouldn\u2019t. She glanced around. He hadn\u2019t come, had he? She looked around and thought she saw the back of his head.<br/>\tShe\u2019d followed him career from Not Another Teen Movie through Avengers and Gifted. She had all his movies. Every magazine he\u2019d graced the cover of. She even went to see him in Lobby Hero. But she\u2019d never, ever made any attempt to contact him. Would he even remember her? Part of her wished for it. The part dreaded it. And yet another part wished he didn\u2019t show up.</p><p>\tFifth drink, sixth drink, feeling less awkward, she leaned against the bar. \u201cYou threw up on Shane Abbott\u2019s shoes in the cafeteria.\u201d</p><p>\tShe winced and turned to the person. Time had been both kind and cruel to him. Where he still looked young, he had no hair and had gotten glasses since then. \u201cI had food poisoning.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cYeah, that\u2019s what everyone said.\u201d</p><p>\tShe looked up and there he was, Chris Evans, across the room and talking to people like twenty years hadn\u2019t passed. Her belly twisted and her face flushed. Their eyes met and he smiled. Hers widened and she looked away. She needed air. \u201cI\u2019ve gotta go.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cWell, it was good\u2026seeing you-\u201c The guy scoffed. \u201cStill a little stuck up bitch.\u201d</p><p>\tShe ducked out the door to the beer garden and took in a lungful of cool, fresh air before downing the rest of the drink. She desperately wanted another. She desperately wanted to leave. This had been a bad idea. She dropped into an empty chair at an empty table. He\u2019d smiled at her. Chris fucking Evans smiled at her. And she was thrown right back to high school, watching him in plays and silently across the room. Meg had known about her crush on Chris.</p><p>\tShe closed her eyes and leaned back in the chair. She could see his eyes and beautiful, bearded face. She scrubbed her hand down her face and groaned. \u201cI need another drink.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cWhat are you drinking?\u201d</p><p>\tHer eyes snapped open at the sound of his voice. The image in her head replaced but his real face. \u201cI-uh\u2026\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cSorry, didn\u2019t mean to impose.\u201d He ducked his head and held up his hand. \u201cYou looked a little upset and there didn\u2019t appear to be anyone checking on you, so\u2026\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cThanks, Chris.\u201d She sat up in the chair.</p><p>\t\u201cYou remember me.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cYou\u2019re kind of hard to forget. Plus, the name-tag.\u201d She pointed at his chest and the white sticker that read simply \u2018Chris\u2019.</p><p>\tHe chuckled. \u201cYeah, that would give it away. Mind if I sit?\u201d</p><p>\tShe swallowed. \u201cYeah, sure, go right ahead.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cCan I tell you something?\u201d</p><p>\tShe looked around at the lack of people in the beer garden. She was nearly alone with Chris Evans, her high school crush that became her celebrity crush. \u201cYeah, sure, of course.\u201d</p><p>\tChris leaned forward, his elbows on his knees. His eyes flicked down to her mouth then her body. He licked his lips as he fiddled with the beer bottle in his hand. \u201cI had the biggest crush on you in high school.\u201d</p><p>\tShe laughed in shock. \u201cWhat?\u201d He nodded, smiling in a self-deprecating way. \u201cMe? Why?\u201d</p><p>\tHe shrugged. \u201cYou were cute, smart and funny. And I hadn\u2019t grown up with you so you weren\u2019t like a sister to me.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cOh.\u201d She looked down at her empty glass and wished she could crawl inside it.</p><p>\t\u201cYou look good.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cThanks, you too.\u201d She winced at how disingenuous she sounded.</p><p>\tChris blinked. \u201cWell, sorry to bother you.\u201d He stood up to leave and she began to panic as he walked away.</p><p>\t\u201cI had a crush on you too.\u201d She cringed. Had she really just said that out loud?</p><p>\tChris turned back around and sat back down. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you say anything?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cNo confidence. And by the time I had enough to ask, you\u2019d moved to LA and I was in college.\u201d</p><p>\tHe nodded, understanding. \u201cSo\u2026what about now?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cDo you still like me?\u201d</p><p>\tShe laughed and scoffed. \u201cWell, yeah.\u201d</p><p>\tHe took her hand in his. \u201cThen let\u2019s get out of here.\u201d</p><p>\tShe laughed more and he smiled. \u201cChristopher Evans, did you come to your high school reunion to pick up chicks?\u201d</p><p>\tHe laughed and shook his head. \u201cFuck, it does seem like that, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cA little.\u201d She held up her pointer finger and thumb. His thumb caressed over the back of her hand, back and forth. He looked at her with the same eyes she\u2019d fallen into 22 years ago; the bluest eyes she\u2019d ever seen.</p><p>\t\u201cHonestly?\u201d She nodded. \u201cI saw you comment on one of my Twitter posts, but I didn\u2019t want to be \u2018that guy\u2019 and slide into your DMs and use my celebrity. When I saw your tweet saying you were going to the reunion, I decided to come.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cYou\u2026came to see me?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cI did.\u201d</p><p>\tShe looked at him disbelief then slowly smiled. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cYes what?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cYes, let\u2019s get out of here.\u201d She stood up, holding his hand.</p><p>\t\u201cOk then.\u201d He pushed open the door in the wooden fence and held it open for her. \u201cWhere do you want to go? What do you want to do?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cI don\u2019t know and I don\u2019t care.\u201d She leaned against the hood of her car. He instinctively moved between her legs. She looked up at him, a curious look on her face at the curious look on his. \u201cChris?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cWould it be too forward of me to kiss you right now?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cNo, not at all\u2026well maybe a little.\u201d She smiled. He ducked his head and captured her lips. They were as soft as she\u2019d imagined and his beard smelled amazing and so soft. She sighed, parting her lips and he took full advantage, slipping his tongue between them. She moaned softly and draped her arms over his broad shoulders. He answered her moan with his own, bracing his hand against the hood of the car. His other squeezed her waist then cupped her cheek.</p><p>\tTheir tongues danced, hot breath mingling in sighs. He pecked her lips and again and again before resting his forehead on hers. \u201cSorry, I\u2026that was better than I ever imagined.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cYeah.\u201d Her breathy voice tore right through him. She combed her fingers through the hair at the nape of his neck. His fingers danced down her collarbone to the hollow of her throat. She looked up at him demurely from under her brow and bit her bottom lip. Chris growled and kissed her hard. He stepped forward, his hand on the car moving to cradle her ass and pull her against him. She moaned around his demanding tongue. The feeling of his hard cock against her sensitive cunt sent a thrill through her. \u201cFuck.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cYou want to?\u201d Chris panted as he kissed and nipped her throat and shoulder. He prayed she said yes. He grabbed her ass with both hands and held her against him as he ground his cock bulge between her legs.</p><p>\t\u201cGod yes\u2026\u201d He rucked the skirt of her dress around her hips and slipped his hand between them. She sucked in a breath at the touch of his thick fingers against her panties. He groaned at the wet spot there. He petted her through the wet fabric, making her wiggle and sigh. He nipped her ear lobe, teasing his fingers between her panties and her pussy. She heard herself whimper when he pushed not one but two fingers inside her.</p><p>\tHe groaned, pressing the bulge of his hard cock against her thigh. \u201cGoddamn, you\u2019re so fucking wet.\u201d She felt like she should apologize. She didn\u2019t know what for though. His slick fingers caressed in and out of her. \u201cIs this all for me?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cYes, Chris.\u201d She nuzzled against his dark hair, her hips rolling to meet his fingers.</p><p>\t\u201cYou\u2019re so fucking perfect.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cShut up.\u201d He laughed and kissed her sternum. His teeth scraped the top of her breast.</p><p>\t\u201cLay back.\u201d She did, the night chill in the metal pulling her nipples tighter than his kisses and touches had. He drew her panties down her legs then slotted his head between her thighs. His hot breath fell against her cunt. It pulsed, grasping at nothing. He moaned, leaning forward to lick a stripe up her dripping folds.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cChris.\u201d</p><p>\tHe slipped his fingers back inside her, pumping slowly as he licked and sucked on her throbbing clit. She whimpered and twitched, gripping his hair tightly. His beard tickled her pussy but it was so soft and she thrilled at getting her scent all over it so he would smell her later. He moaned and pushed his fingers deeper, curling, searching. Her back bowed when he found it. She had a moment of clarity. Of what the fuck am I doing? Right before she came.</p><p>\tChris hummed in delight, kitten licking her cunt clean before placing a kiss on her thigh. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me you\u2019re spent.\u201d</p><p>\tShe lifted her hands for him to take. He pulled her up. \u201cNo but\u2026perhaps we should move somewhere where we might not be seen?\u201d</p><p>\tHe grinned. He knew just the place. The drive was short and he had her back on the hood, literally. Her legs dangled over the edge of the fender. \u201cFuck, you\u2019re so beautiful.\u201d His hands rubbed up her thighs, pushing her skirt up. He sighed at her pussy, glistening in the moonlight. \u201cYou sure you want this?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cYes, Chris.\u201d More than anything. Please. She leaned up on her elbows, watching as he stroked himself fully hard again then rolled a condom on. His cockhead rested against her entrance. She wrapped her legs around his thighs and urged him forward. He sunk into her slowly, watching her face pinch then relax in the moonlight. Fuck, she was beautiful. How many times had he jacked off to what he imagined this would be when he was younger? When he wondered about her while he was single? When he kicked himself for not asking her when he had the chance?</p><p>\tHis thighs trembled, the pressure built rapidly. He found her hands and locked their fingers together. Her breasts bounced as he rutted into her. Even through the thin latex, he felt so fucking good, snug and tight. And her sounds. Fuck. She moaned and cried and sighed his name. She lifted her hips to meet his thrusts so his thick cock hit deep. And my god, he was gonna cum.</p><p>\t\u201cAre you close, babe?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cAlmost there.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cTell me what-tell me what to do.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cMy clit\u2026\u201d He didn\u2019t have to be told twice. He brought their hands to his mouth, licking his fingers and hers.</p><p>\t\u201cShow me, baby.\u201d They rubbed her clit together. Her cunt fluttered around his cock and his chest tightened.</p><p>\tShe was panting and wrecked, legs shaking and useless. She was so close to cumming. \u201cStop, wait.\u201d He frowned but he did, breathing hard and fast. She slid off the hood of the car and bent over, moving onto the balls of her feet. She flipped the dress up to bare her ass to him.</p><p>He grinned. \u201cOk, babe.\u201d He slapped her ass, grabbing a rough handful before sunk back in, balls deep. Her groan echoed his and whatever control he had, he lost. He gripped her pretty curls hard and bowed her backward. She gasped. Her fingers went back to her clit.</p><p>\tChris fucked her hard, bringing her up onto her toes and god, she loved it. He grunted with his effort. She reached back and grabbed his hand on her hip. Her cunt clenched around him and her world went white, screaming his name. He held onto her hair, pressing his forehead against the back of her head. His back stiffened and groaned deep in chest, filling the condom.</p><p>\tHe sat in the passenger seat with the door open and her across his lap. They watched the stars and listened to the night sounds. His thumb caressed her thigh. \u201cI want to see you again.\u201d He looked down at her. \u201cCan I see you again?\u201d<br/>\tShe grinned. \u201cYea, yes, I\u2019d like that.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cGood.\u201d He grinned as he kissed her. </p>",

None of them would remember her anyway. Right? If things got too awkward, she could just leave. Riiiiiiiiiiiight.</p>[[MORE]]<p>\tSo here she was. Dressed in a flirty, flowing light pink dress and sandals with her hair in soft curls, pretending like she belonged. She sipped her drink, rum, pineapple and Redbull. Ok, she sipped her fourth drink. It didn\u2019t help with the itching in her brain that told her no one wanted her here. Her anxiety flipped back and forth between telling her that everyone was ignoring her to everyone was staring at her.</p><p>\t\u201cHi?\u201d</p><p>\tShe turned slowly to the female voice. \u201cHi?\u201d</p><p>\tThe brunette smiled. \u201cI thought that was you. We were bio lab partners senior year.\u201d Her face pinched as she tried to remember. She\u2019d brain-dumped everyone from the last 2 years of high school. Except one person that she\u2019d yet to see. \u201cI had braces and really bad acne. Still have the glasses though.\u201d</p><p>\tShe gasped and her eyes widened. \u201cMeg!\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cYeah!\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cHow are you doing? You look great.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cMarried, baby number two on the way.\u201d She wiggled her ring finger then rubbed her belly. \u201cIt\u2019s Megan Metlzer now though.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cYou married Mr. Metlzer the student teacher?\u201d She remembered them giggling over the hot nerd student teacher.</p><p>\t\u201cYeah, yeah.\u201d She nodded and sipped her soda. \u201cWe ran into each other after graduation.\u201d She rolled her eyes at herself and shook her head. \u201cSorry, that sounds so clich\u00e9.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cIt\u2019s ok.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cI don\u2019t want you to think he did anything inappropriate.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cI didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cHis senior year was my freshman year. We happened to have a class together. And it just bloomed from there.\u201d She shrugged.</p><p>\t\u201cThat\u2019s great. I\u2019m really happy for you, Meg.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cSo, what about you?\u201d Meg nudged her arm. \u201cMarried? Kids? Pets?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cNah, I work a lot. And I enjoy my quiet time.\u201d She sipped her drink only to find it empty.</p><p>\t\u201cThat\u2019s a shame. I always thought you and Chris would eventually hook up, ya know?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cWhat-what makes you say that?\u201d Megan shrugged. \u201cI need refill.\u201d She waved her glass. \u201cI\u2019ll be right back.\u201d No, she wouldn\u2019t. She glanced around. He hadn\u2019t come, had he? She looked around and thought she saw the back of his head.<br>\tShe\u2019d followed him career from Not Another Teen Movie through Avengers and Gifted. She had all his movies. Every magazine he\u2019d graced the cover of. She even went to see him in Lobby Hero. But she\u2019d never, ever made any attempt to contact him. Would he even remember her? Part of her wished for it. The part dreaded it. And yet another part wished he didn\u2019t show up.</p><p>\tFifth drink, sixth drink, feeling less awkward, she leaned against the bar. \u201cYou threw up on Shane Abbott\u2019s shoes in the cafeteria.\u201d</p><p>\tShe winced and turned to the person. Time had been both kind and cruel to him. Where he still looked young, he had no hair and had gotten glasses since then. \u201cI had food poisoning.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cYeah, that\u2019s what everyone said.\u201d</p><p>\tShe looked up and there he was, Chris Evans, across the room and talking to people like twenty years hadn\u2019t passed. Her belly twisted and her face flushed. Their eyes met and he smiled. Hers widened and she looked away. She needed air. \u201cI\u2019ve gotta go.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cWell, it was good\u2026seeing you-\u201c The guy scoffed. \u201cStill a little stuck up bitch.\u201d</p><p>\tShe ducked out the door to the beer garden and took in a lungful of cool, fresh air before downing the rest of the drink. She desperately wanted another. She desperately wanted to leave. This had been a bad idea. She dropped into an empty chair at an empty table. He\u2019d smiled at her. Chris fucking Evans smiled at her. And she was thrown right back to high school, watching him in plays and silently across the room. Meg had known about her crush on Chris.</p><p>\tShe closed her eyes and leaned back in the chair. She could see his eyes and beautiful, bearded face. She scrubbed her hand down her face and groaned. \u201cI need another drink.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cWhat are you drinking?\u201d</p><p>\tHer eyes snapped open at the sound of his voice. The image in her head replaced but his real face. \u201cI-uh\u2026\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cSorry, didn\u2019t mean to impose.\u201d He ducked his head and held up his hand. \u201cYou looked a little upset and there didn\u2019t appear to be anyone checking on you, so\u2026\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cThanks, Chris.\u201d She sat up in the chair.</p><p>\t\u201cYou remember me.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cYou\u2019re kind of hard to forget. Plus, the name-tag.\u201d She pointed at his chest and the white sticker that read simply \u2018Chris\u2019.</p><p>\tHe chuckled. \u201cYeah, that would give it away. Mind if I sit?\u201d</p><p>\tShe swallowed. \u201cYeah, sure, go right ahead.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cCan I tell you something?\u201d</p><p>\tShe looked around at the lack of people in the beer garden. She was nearly alone with Chris Evans, her high school crush that became her celebrity crush. \u201cYeah, sure, of course.\u201d</p><p>\tChris leaned forward, his elbows on his knees. His eyes flicked down to her mouth then her body. He licked his lips as he fiddled with the beer bottle in his hand. \u201cI had the biggest crush on you in high school.\u201d</p><p>\tShe laughed in shock. \u201cWhat?\u201d He nodded, smiling in a self-deprecating way. \u201cMe? Why?\u201d</p><p>\tHe shrugged. \u201cYou were cute, smart and funny. And I hadn\u2019t grown up with you so you weren\u2019t like a sister to me.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cOh.\u201d She looked down at her empty glass and wished she could crawl inside it.</p><p>\t\u201cYou look good.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cThanks, you too.\u201d She winced at how disingenuous she sounded.</p><p>\tChris blinked. \u201cWell, sorry to bother you.\u201d He stood up to leave and she began to panic as he walked away.</p><p>\t\u201cI had a crush on you too.\u201d She cringed. Had she really just said that out loud?</p><p>\tChris turned back around and sat back down. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you say anything?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cNo confidence. And by the time I had enough to ask, you\u2019d moved to LA and I was in college.\u201d</p><p>\tHe nodded, understanding. \u201cSo\u2026what about now?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cDo you still like me?\u201d</p><p>\tShe laughed and scoffed. \u201cWell, yeah.\u201d</p><p>\tHe took her hand in his. \u201cThen let\u2019s get out of here.\u201d</p><p>\tShe laughed more and he smiled. \u201cChristopher Evans, did you come to your high school reunion to pick up chicks?\u201d</p><p>\tHe laughed and shook his head. \u201cFuck, it does seem like that, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cA little.\u201d She held up her pointer finger and thumb. His thumb caressed over the back of her hand, back and forth. He looked at her with the same eyes she\u2019d fallen into 22 years ago; the bluest eyes she\u2019d ever seen.</p><p>\t\u201cHonestly?\u201d She nodded. \u201cI saw you comment on one of my Twitter posts, but I didn\u2019t want to be \u2018that guy\u2019 and slide into your DMs and use my celebrity. When I saw your tweet saying you were going to the reunion, I decided to come.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cYou\u2026came to see me?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cI did.\u201d</p><p>\tShe looked at him disbelief then slowly smiled. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cYes what?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cYes, let\u2019s get out of here.\u201d She stood up, holding his hand.</p><p>\t\u201cOk then.\u201d He pushed open the door in the wooden fence and held it open for her. \u201cWhere do you want to go? What do you want to do?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cI don\u2019t know and I don\u2019t care.\u201d She leaned against the hood of her car. He instinctively moved between her legs.

Her legs dangled over the edge of the fender. \u201cFuck, you\u2019re so beautiful.\u201d His hands rubbed up her thighs, pushing her skirt up. He sighed at her pussy, glistening in the moonlight. \u201cYou sure you want this?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cYes, Chris.\u201d More than anything. Please. She leaned up on her elbows, watching as he stroked himself fully hard again then rolled a condom on. His cockhead rested against her entrance. She wrapped her legs around his thighs and urged him forward. He sunk into her slowly, watching her face pinch then relax in the moonlight. Fuck, she was beautiful. How many times had he jacked off to what he imagined this would be when he was younger? When he wondered about her while he was single? When he kicked himself for not asking her when he had the chance?</p><p>\tHis thighs trembled, the pressure built rapidly. He found her hands and locked their fingers together. Her breasts bounced as he rutted into her. Even through the thin latex, he felt so fucking good, snug and tight. And her sounds. Fuck. She moaned and cried and sighed his name. She lifted her hips to meet his thrusts so his thick cock hit deep. And my god, he was gonna cum.</p><p>\t\u201cAre you close, babe?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cAlmost there.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cTell me what-tell me what to do.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cMy clit\u2026\u201d He didn\u2019t have to be told twice. He brought their hands to his mouth, licking his fingers and hers.</p><p>\t\u201cShow me, baby.\u201d They rubbed her clit together. Her cunt fluttered around his cock and his chest tightened.</p><p>\tShe was panting and wrecked, legs shaking and useless. She was so close to cumming. \u201cStop, wait.\u201d He frowned but he did, breathing hard and fast. She slid off the hood of the car and bent over, moving onto the balls of her feet. She flipped the dress up to bare her ass to him.</p><p>He grinned. \u201cOk, babe.\u201d He slapped her ass, grabbing a rough handful before sunk back in, balls deep. Her groan echoed his and whatever control he had, he lost. He gripped her pretty curls hard and bowed her backward. She gasped. Her fingers went back to her clit.</p><p>\tChris fucked her hard, bringing her up onto her toes and god, she loved it. He grunted with his effort. She reached back and grabbed his hand on her hip. Her cunt clenched around him and her world went white, screaming his name. He held onto her hair, pressing his forehead against the back of her head. His back stiffened and groaned deep in chest, filling the condom.</p><p>\tHe sat in the passenger seat with the door open and her across his lap. They watched the stars and listened to the night sounds. His thumb caressed her thigh. \u201cI want to see you again.\u201d He looked down at her. \u201cCan I see you again?\u201d<br>\tShe grinned. \u201cYea, yes, I\u2019d like that.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cGood.\u201d He grinned as he kissed her. </p>",

Being a new kid her junior year coupled with social anxiety had made school a hellish experience. She couldn\u2019t fault her parents for moving to the community.

None of them would remember her anyway. Right? If things got too awkward, she could just leave. Riiiiiiiiiiiight.</p>[[MORE]]<p>\tSo here she was. Dressed in a flirty, flowing light pink dress and sandals with her hair in soft curls, pretending like she belonged. She sipped her drink, rum, pineapple and Redbull. Ok, she sipped her fourth drink. It didn\u2019t help with the itching in her brain that told her no one wanted her here. Her anxiety flipped back and forth between telling her that everyone was ignoring her to everyone was staring at her.</p><p>\t\u201cHi?\u201d</p><p>\tShe turned slowly to the female voice. \u201cHi?\u201d</p><p>\tThe brunette smiled. \u201cI thought that was you. We were bio lab partners senior year.\u201d Her face pinched as she tried to remember. She\u2019d brain-dumped everyone from the last 2 years of high school. Except one person that she\u2019d yet to see. \u201cI had braces and really bad acne. Still have the glasses though.\u201d</p><p>\tShe gasped and her eyes widened. \u201cMeg!\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cYeah!\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cHow are you doing? You look great.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cMarried, baby number two on the way.\u201d She wiggled her ring finger then rubbed her belly. \u201cIt\u2019s Megan Metlzer now though.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cYou married Mr. Metlzer the student teacher?\u201d She remembered them giggling over the hot nerd student teacher.</p><p>\t\u201cYeah, yeah.\u201d She nodded and sipped her soda. \u201cWe ran into each other after graduation.\u201d She rolled her eyes at herself and shook her head. \u201cSorry, that sounds so clich\u00e9.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cIt\u2019s ok.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cI don\u2019t want you to think he did anything inappropriate.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cI didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cHis senior year was my freshman year. We happened to have a class together. And it just bloomed from there.\u201d She shrugged.</p><p>\t\u201cThat\u2019s great. I\u2019m really happy for you, Meg.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cSo, what about you?\u201d Meg nudged her arm. \u201cMarried? Kids? Pets?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cNah, I work a lot. And I enjoy my quiet time.\u201d She sipped her drink only to find it empty.</p><p>\t\u201cThat\u2019s a shame. I always thought you and Chris would eventually hook up, ya know?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cWhat-what makes you say that?\u201d Megan shrugged. \u201cI need refill.\u201d She waved her glass. \u201cI\u2019ll be right back.\u201d No, she wouldn\u2019t. She glanced around. He hadn\u2019t come, had he? She looked around and thought she saw the back of his head.<br>\tShe\u2019d followed him career from Not Another Teen Movie through Avengers and Gifted. She had all his movies. Every magazine he\u2019d graced the cover of. She even went to see him in Lobby Hero. But she\u2019d never, ever made any attempt to contact him. Would he even remember her? Part of her wished for it. The part dreaded it. And yet another part wished he didn\u2019t show up.</p><p>\tFifth drink, sixth drink, feeling less awkward, she leaned against the bar. \u201cYou threw up on Shane Abbott\u2019s shoes in the cafeteria.\u201d</p><p>\tShe winced and turned to the person. Time had been both kind and cruel to him. Where he still looked young, he had no hair and had gotten glasses since then. \u201cI had food poisoning.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cYeah, that\u2019s what everyone said.\u201d</p><p>\tShe looked up and there he was, Chris Evans, across the room and talking to people like twenty years hadn\u2019t passed. Her belly twisted and her face flushed. Their eyes met and he smiled. Hers widened and she looked away. She needed air. \u201cI\u2019ve gotta go.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cWell, it was good\u2026seeing you-\u201c The guy scoffed. \u201cStill a little stuck up bitch.\u201d</p><p>\tShe ducked out the door to the beer garden and took in a lungful of cool, fresh air before downing the rest of the drink. She desperately wanted another. She desperately wanted to leave. This had been a bad idea. She dropped into an empty chair at an empty table. He\u2019d smiled at her. Chris fucking Evans smiled at her. And she was thrown right back to high school, watching him in plays and silently across the room. Meg had known about her crush on Chris.</p><p>\tShe closed her eyes and leaned back in the chair. She could see his eyes and beautiful, bearded face. She scrubbed her hand down her face and groaned. \u201cI need another drink.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cWhat are you drinking?\u201d</p><p>\tHer eyes snapped open at the sound of his voice. The image in her head replaced but his real face. \u201cI-uh\u2026\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cSorry, didn\u2019t mean to impose.\u201d He ducked his head and held up his hand. \u201cYou looked a little upset and there didn\u2019t appear to be anyone checking on you, so\u2026\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cThanks, Chris.\u201d She sat up in the chair.</p><p>\t\u201cYou remember me.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cYou\u2019re kind of hard to forget. Plus, the name-tag.\u201d She pointed at his chest and the white sticker that read simply \u2018Chris\u2019.</p><p>\tHe chuckled. \u201cYeah, that would give it away. Mind if I sit?\u201d</p><p>\tShe swallowed. \u201cYeah, sure, go right ahead.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cCan I tell you something?\u201d</p><p>\tShe looked around at the lack of people in the beer garden. She was nearly alone with Chris Evans, her high school crush that became her celebrity crush. \u201cYeah, sure, of course.\u201d</p><p>\tChris leaned forward, his elbows on his knees. His eyes flicked down to her mouth then her body. He licked his lips as he fiddled with the beer bottle in his hand. \u201cI had the biggest crush on you in high school.\u201d</p><p>\tShe laughed in shock. \u201cWhat?\u201d He nodded, smiling in a self-deprecating way. \u201cMe? Why?\u201d</p><p>\tHe shrugged. \u201cYou were cute, smart and funny. And I hadn\u2019t grown up with you so you weren\u2019t like a sister to me.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cOh.\u201d She looked down at her empty glass and wished she could crawl inside it.</p><p>\t\u201cYou look good.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cThanks, you too.\u201d She winced at how disingenuous she sounded.</p><p>\tChris blinked. \u201cWell, sorry to bother you.\u201d He stood up to leave and she began to panic as he walked away.</p><p>\t\u201cI had a crush on you too.\u201d She cringed. Had she really just said that out loud?</p><p>\tChris turned back around and sat back down. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you say anything?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cNo confidence. And by the time I had enough to ask, you\u2019d moved to LA and I was in college.\u201d</p><p>\tHe nodded, understanding. \u201cSo\u2026what about now?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cDo you still like me?\u201d</p><p>\tShe laughed and scoffed. \u201cWell, yeah.\u201d</p><p>\tHe took her hand in his. \u201cThen let\u2019s get out of here.\u201d</p><p>\tShe laughed more and he smiled. \u201cChristopher Evans, did you come to your high school reunion to pick up chicks?\u201d</p><p>\tHe laughed and shook his head. \u201cFuck, it does seem like that, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cA little.\u201d She held up her pointer finger and thumb. His thumb caressed over the back of her hand, back and forth. He looked at her with the same eyes she\u2019d fallen into 22 years ago; the bluest eyes she\u2019d ever seen.</p><p>\t\u201cHonestly?\u201d She nodded. \u201cI saw you comment on one of my Twitter posts, but I didn\u2019t want to be \u2018that guy\u2019 and slide into your DMs and use my celebrity. When I saw your tweet saying you were going to the reunion, I decided to come.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cYou\u2026came to see me?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cI did.\u201d</p><p>\tShe looked at him disbelief then slowly smiled. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cYes what?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cYes, let\u2019s get out of here.\u201d She stood up, holding his hand.</p><p>\t\u201cOk then.\u201d He pushed open the door in the wooden fence and held it open for her. \u201cWhere do you want to go? What do you want to do?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cI don\u2019t know and I don\u2019t care.\u201d She leaned against the hood of her car. He instinctively moved between her legs. She looked up at him, a curious look on her face at the curious look on his. \u201cChris?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cWould it be too forward of me to kiss you right now?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cNo, not at all\u2026well maybe a little.\u201d She smiled. He ducked his head and captured her lips. They were as soft as she\u2019d imagined and his beard smelled amazing and so soft. She sighed, parting her lips and he took full advantage, slipping his tongue between them. She moaned softly and draped her arms over his broad shoulders. He answered her moan with his own, bracing his hand against the hood of the car. His other squeezed her waist then cupped her cheek.</p><p>\tTheir tongues danced, hot breath mingling in sighs. He pecked her lips and again and again before resting his forehead on hers. \u201cSorry, I\u2026that was better than I ever imagined.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cYeah.\u201d Her breathy voice tore right through him. She combed her fingers through the hair at the nape of his neck. His fingers danced down her collarbone to the hollow of her throat. She looked up at him demurely from under her brow and bit her bottom lip. Chris growled and kissed her hard. He stepped forward, his hand on the car moving to cradle her ass and pull her against him. She moaned around his demanding tongue. The feeling of his hard cock against her sensitive cunt sent a thrill through her. \u201cFuck.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cYou want to?\u201d Chris panted as he kissed and nipped her throat and shoulder. He prayed she said yes. He grabbed her ass with both hands and held her against him as he ground his cock bulge between her legs.</p><p>\t\u201cGod yes\u2026\u201d He rucked the skirt of her dress around her hips and slipped his hand between them. She sucked in a breath at the touch of his thick fingers against her panties. He groaned at the wet spot there. He petted her through the wet fabric, making her wiggle and sigh. He nipped her ear lobe, teasing his fingers between her panties and her pussy. She heard herself whimper when he pushed not one but two fingers inside her.</p><p>\tHe groaned, pressing the bulge of his hard cock against her thigh. \u201cGoddamn, you\u2019re so fucking wet.\u201d She felt like she should apologize. She didn\u2019t know what for though. His slick fingers caressed in and out of her. \u201cIs this all for me?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cYes, Chris.\u201d She nuzzled against his dark hair, her hips rolling to meet his fingers.</p><p>\t\u201cYou\u2019re so fucking perfect.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cShut up.\u201d He laughed and kissed her sternum. His teeth scraped the top of her breast.</p><p>\t\u201cLay back.\u201d She did, the night chill in the metal pulling her nipples tighter than his kisses and touches had. He drew her panties down her legs then slotted his head between her thighs. His hot breath fell against her cunt. It pulsed, grasping at nothing. He moaned, leaning forward to lick a stripe up her dripping folds.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cChris.\u201d</p><p>\tHe slipped his fingers back inside her, pumping slowly as he licked and sucked on her throbbing clit. She whimpered and twitched, gripping his hair tightly. His beard tickled her pussy but it was so soft and she thrilled at getting her scent all over it so he would smell her later. He moaned and pushed his fingers deeper, curling, searching. Her back bowed when he found it. She had a moment of clarity. Of what the fuck am I doing? Right before she came.</p><p>\tChris hummed in delight, kitten licking her cunt clean before placing a kiss on her thigh. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me you\u2019re spent.\u201d</p><p>\tShe lifted her hands for him to take. He pulled her up. \u201cNo but\u2026perhaps we should move somewhere where we might not be seen?\u201d</p><p>\tHe grinned. He knew just the place. The drive was short and he had her back on the hood, literally. Her legs dangled over the edge of the fender. \u201cFuck, you\u2019re so beautiful.\u201d His hands rubbed up her thighs, pushing her skirt up. He sighed at her pussy, glistening in the moonlight. \u201cYou sure you want this?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cYes, Chris.\u201d More than anything. Please. She leaned up on her elbows, watching as he stroked himself fully hard again then rolled a condom on. His cockhead rested against her entrance. She wrapped her legs around his thighs and urged him forward. He sunk into her slowly, watching her face pinch then relax in the moonlight. Fuck, she was beautiful.

He brought their hands to his mouth, licking his fingers and hers.</p><p>\t\u201cShow me, baby.\u201d They rubbed her clit together. Her cunt fluttered around his cock and his chest tightened.</p><p>\tShe was panting and wrecked, legs shaking and useless. She was so close to cumming. \u201cStop, wait.\u201d He frowned but he did, breathing hard and fast. She slid off the hood of the car and bent over, moving onto the balls of her feet.

They watched the stars and listened to the night sounds. His thumb caressed her thigh. \u201cI want to see you again.\u201d He looked down at her. \u201cCan I see you again?\u201d<br>\tShe grinned. \u201cYea, yes, I\u2019d like that.\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cGood.\u201d He grinned as he kissed her. </p>",

Still have the glasses though.&rdquo;</p><p>\tShe gasped and her eyes widened. &ldquo;Meg!&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Yeah!&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;How are you doing? You look great.&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Married, baby number two on the way.&rdquo; She wiggled her ring finger then rubbed her belly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Megan Metlzer now though.&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;You married Mr. Metlzer the student teacher?&rdquo; She remembered them giggling over the hot nerd student teacher.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Yeah, yeah.&rdquo; She nodded and sipped her soda. &ldquo;We ran into each other after graduation.&rdquo; She rolled her eyes at herself and shook her head. &ldquo;Sorry, that sounds so clich&eacute;.&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;It&rsquo;s ok.&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want you to think he did anything inappropriate.&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;His senior year was my freshman year. We happened to have a class together. And it just bloomed from there.&rdquo; She shrugged.</p><p>\t&ldquo;That&rsquo;s great. I&rsquo;m really happy for you, Meg.&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;So, what about you?&rdquo; Meg nudged her arm. &ldquo;Married? Kids? Pets?&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Nah, I work a lot. And I enjoy my quiet time.&rdquo; She sipped her drink only to find it empty.</p><p>\t&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a shame. I always thought you and Chris would eventually hook up, ya know?&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;What-what makes you say that?&rdquo; Megan shrugged. &ldquo;I need refill.&rdquo; She waved her glass. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be right back.&rdquo; No, she wouldn&rsquo;t. She glanced around. He hadn&rsquo;t come, had he? She looked around and thought she saw the back of his head.<br />\tShe&rsquo;d followed him career from Not Another Teen Movie through Avengers and Gifted. She had all his movies. Every magazine he&rsquo;d graced the cover of. She even went to see him in Lobby Hero. But she&rsquo;d never, ever made any attempt to contact him. Would he even remember her? Part of her wished for it. The part dreaded it. And yet another part wished he didn&rsquo;t show up.</p><p>\tFifth drink, sixth drink, feeling less awkward, she leaned against the bar. &ldquo;You threw up on Shane Abbott&rsquo;s shoes in the cafeteria.&rdquo;</p><p>\tShe winced and turned to the person. Time had been both kind and cruel to him. Where he still looked young, he had no hair and had gotten glasses since then. &ldquo;I had food poisoning.&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Yeah, that&rsquo;s what everyone said.&rdquo;</p><p>\tShe looked up and there he was, Chris Evans, across the room and talking to people like twenty years hadn&rsquo;t passed. Her belly twisted and her face flushed. Their eyes met and he smiled. Hers widened and she looked away. She needed air. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve gotta go.&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Well, it was good&hellip;seeing you-&ldquo; The guy scoffed. &ldquo;Still a little stuck up bitch.&rdquo;</p><p>\tShe ducked out the door to the beer garden and took in a lungful of cool, fresh air before downing the rest of the drink. She desperately wanted another. She desperately wanted to leave. This had been a bad idea. She dropped into an empty chair at an empty table. He&rsquo;d smiled at her. Chris fucking Evans smiled at her. And she was thrown right back to high school, watching him in plays and silently across the room. Meg had known about her crush on Chris.</p><p>\tShe closed her eyes and leaned back in the chair. She could see his eyes and beautiful, bearded face. She scrubbed her hand down her face and groaned. &ldquo;I need another drink.&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;What are you drinking?&rdquo;</p><p>\tHer eyes snapped open at the sound of his voice. The image in her head replaced but his real face. &ldquo;I-uh&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Sorry, didn&rsquo;t mean to impose.&rdquo; He ducked his head and held up his hand. &ldquo;You looked a little upset and there didn&rsquo;t appear to be anyone checking on you, so&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Thanks, Chris.&rdquo; She sat up in the chair.</p><p>\t&ldquo;You remember me.&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;You&rsquo;re kind of hard to forget. Plus, the name-tag.&rdquo; She pointed at his chest and the white sticker that read simply &lsquo;Chris&rsquo;.</p><p>\tHe chuckled. &ldquo;Yeah, that would give it away. Mind if I sit?&rdquo;</p><p>\tShe swallowed. &ldquo;Yeah, sure, go right ahead.&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Can I tell you something?&rdquo;</p><p>\tShe looked around at the lack of people in the beer garden. She was nearly alone with Chris Evans, her high school crush that became her celebrity crush. &ldquo;Yeah, sure, of course.&rdquo;</p><p>\tChris leaned forward, his elbows on his knees. His eyes flicked down to her mouth then her body. He licked his lips as he fiddled with the beer bottle in his hand. &ldquo;I had the biggest crush on you in high school.&rdquo;</p><p>\tShe laughed in shock. &ldquo;What?&rdquo; He nodded, smiling in a self-deprecating way. &ldquo;Me? Why?&rdquo;</p><p>\tHe shrugged. &ldquo;You were cute, smart and funny. And I hadn&rsquo;t grown up with you so you weren&rsquo;t like a sister to me.&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Oh.&rdquo; She looked down at her empty glass and wished she could crawl inside it.</p><p>\t&ldquo;You look good.&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Thanks, you too.&rdquo; She winced at how disingenuous she sounded.</p><p>\tChris blinked. &ldquo;Well, sorry to bother you.&rdquo; He stood up to leave and she began to panic as he walked away.</p><p>\t&ldquo;I had a crush on you too.&rdquo; She cringed. Had she really just said that out loud?</p><p>\tChris turned back around and sat back down. &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you say anything?&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;No confidence. And by the time I had enough to ask, you&rsquo;d moved to LA and I was in college.&rdquo;</p><p>\tHe nodded, understanding. &ldquo;So&hellip;what about now?&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Do you still like me?&rdquo;</p><p>\tShe laughed and scoffed. &ldquo;Well, yeah.&rdquo;</p><p>\tHe took her hand in his. &ldquo;Then let&rsquo;s get out of here.&rdquo;</p><p>\tShe laughed more and he smiled. &ldquo;Christopher Evans, did you come to your high school reunion to pick up chicks?&rdquo;</p><p>\tHe laughed and shook his head. &ldquo;Fuck, it does seem like that, doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;A little.&rdquo; She held up her pointer finger and thumb. His thumb caressed over the back of her hand, back and forth. He looked at her with the same eyes she&rsquo;d fallen into 22 years ago; the bluest eyes she&rsquo;d ever seen.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Honestly?&rdquo; She nodded. &ldquo;I saw you comment on one of my Twitter posts, but I didn&rsquo;t want to be &lsquo;that guy&rsquo; and slide into your DMs and use my celebrity. When I saw your tweet saying you were going to the reunion, I decided to come.&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;You&hellip;came to see me?&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;I did.&rdquo;</p><p>\tShe looked at him disbelief then slowly smiled. &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Yes what?&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Yes, let&rsquo;s get out of here.&rdquo; She stood up, holding his hand.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Ok then.&rdquo; He pushed open the door in the wooden fence and held it open for her. &ldquo;Where do you want to go? What do you want to do?&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know and I don&rsquo;t care.&rdquo; She leaned against the hood of her car. He instinctively moved between her legs. She looked up at him, a curious look on her face at the curious look on his. &ldquo;Chris?&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Would it be too forward of me to kiss you right now?&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;No, not at all&hellip;well maybe a little.&rdquo; She smiled. He ducked his head and captured her lips. They were as soft as she&rsquo;d imagined and his beard smelled amazing and so soft. She sighed, parting her lips and he took full advantage, slipping his tongue between them. She moaned softly and draped her arms over his broad shoulders. He answered her moan with his own, bracing his hand against the hood of the car. His other squeezed her waist then cupped her cheek.</p><p>\tTheir tongues danced, hot breath mingling in sighs. He pecked her lips and again and again before resting his forehead on hers. &ldquo;Sorry, I&hellip;that was better than I ever imagined.&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo; Her breathy voice tore right through him. She combed her fingers through the hair at the nape of his neck. His fingers danced down her collarbone to the hollow of her throat. She looked up at him demurely from under her brow and bit her bottom lip. Chris growled and kissed her hard. He stepped forward, his hand on the car moving to cradle her ass and pull her against him. She moaned around his demanding tongue. The feeling of his hard cock against her sensitive cunt sent a thrill through her. &ldquo;Fuck.&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;You want to?&rdquo; Chris panted as he kissed and nipped her throat and shoulder. He prayed she said yes. He grabbed her ass with both hands and held her against him as he ground his cock bulge between her legs.</p><p>\t&ldquo;God yes&hellip;&rdquo; He rucked the skirt of her dress around her hips and slipped his hand between them. She sucked in a breath at the touch of his thick fingers against her panties. He groaned at the wet spot there. He petted her through the wet fabric, making her wiggle and sigh. He nipped her ear lobe, teasing his fingers between her panties and her pussy. She heard herself whimper when he pushed not one but two fingers inside her.</p><p>\tHe groaned, pressing the bulge of his hard cock against her thigh. &ldquo;Goddamn, you&rsquo;re so fucking wet.&rdquo; She felt like she should apologize. She didn&rsquo;t know what for though. His slick fingers caressed in and out of her. &ldquo;Is this all for me?&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Yes, Chris.&rdquo; She nuzzled against his dark hair, her hips rolling to meet his fingers.</p><p>\t&ldquo;You&rsquo;re so fucking perfect.&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Shut up.&rdquo; He laughed and kissed her sternum. His teeth scraped the top of her breast.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Lay back.&rdquo; She did, the night chill in the metal pulling her nipples tighter than his kisses and touches had. He drew her panties down her legs then slotted his head between her thighs. His hot breath fell against her cunt. It pulsed, grasping at nothing. He moaned, leaning forward to lick a stripe up her dripping folds.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Chris.&rdquo;</p><p>\tHe slipped his fingers back inside her, pumping slowly as he licked and sucked on her throbbing clit. She whimpered and twitched, gripping his hair tightly. His beard tickled her pussy but it was so soft and she thrilled at getting her scent all over it so he would smell her later. He moaned and pushed his fingers deeper, curling, searching. Her back bowed when he found it. She had a moment of clarity. Of what the fuck am I doing? Right before she came.</p><p>\tChris hummed in delight, kitten licking her cunt clean before placing a kiss on her thigh. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me you&rsquo;re spent.&rdquo;</p><p>\tShe lifted her hands for him to take. He pulled her up. &ldquo;No but&hellip;perhaps we should move somewhere where we might not be seen?&rdquo;</p><p>\tHe grinned. He knew just the place. The drive was short and he had her back on the hood, literally. Her legs dangled over the edge of the fender. &ldquo;Fuck, you&rsquo;re so beautiful.&rdquo; His hands rubbed up her thighs, pushing her skirt up. He sighed at her pussy, glistening in the moonlight. &ldquo;You sure you want this?&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Yes, Chris.&rdquo; More than anything. Please. She leaned up on her elbows, watching as he stroked himself fully hard again then rolled a condom on. His cockhead rested against her entrance. She wrapped her legs around his thighs and urged him forward. He sunk into her slowly, watching her face pinch then relax in the moonlight. Fuck, she was beautiful. How many times had he jacked off to what he imagined this would be when he was younger? When he wondered about her while he was single? When he kicked himself for not asking her when he had the chance?</p><p>\tHis thighs trembled, the pressure built rapidly. He found her hands and locked their fingers together. Her breasts bounced as he rutted into her. Even through the thin latex, he felt so fucking good, snug and tight. And her sounds. Fuck. She moaned and cried and sighed his name. She lifted her hips to meet his thrusts so his thick cock hit deep. And my god, he was gonna cum.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Are you close, babe?&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Almost there.&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Tell me what-tell me what to do.&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;My clit&hellip;&rdquo; He didn&rsquo;t have to be told twice. He brought their hands to his mouth, licking his fingers and hers.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Show me, baby.&rdquo; They rubbed her clit together. Her cunt fluttered around his cock and his chest tightened.</p><p>\tShe was panting and wrecked, legs shaking and useless. She was so close to cumming. &ldquo;Stop, wait.&rdquo; He frowned but he did, breathing hard and fast. She slid off the hood of the car and bent over, moving onto the balls of her feet. She flipped the dress up to bare her ass to him.</p><p>He grinned. &ldquo;Ok, babe.&rdquo; He slapped her ass, grabbing a rough handful before sunk back in, balls deep. Her groan echoed his and whatever control he had, he lost. He gripped her pretty curls hard and bowed her backward. She gasped. Her fingers went back to her clit.</p><p>\tChris fucked her hard, bringing her up onto her toes and god, she loved it. He grunted with his effort. She reached back and grabbed his hand on her hip. Her cunt clenched around him and her world went white, screaming his name. He held onto her hair, pressing his forehead against the back of her head. His back stiffened and groaned deep in chest, filling the condom.</p><p>\tHe sat in the passenger seat with the door open and her across his lap. They watched the stars and listened to the night sounds. His thumb caressed her thigh. &ldquo;I want to see you again.&rdquo; He looked down at her. &ldquo;Can I see you again?&rdquo;<br />\tShe grinned. &ldquo;Yea, yes, I&rsquo;d like that.&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Good.&rdquo; He grinned as he kissed her. </p>",
