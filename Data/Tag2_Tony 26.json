        "body": "<h1>Summer Vacation Pt.1</h1><p>Peter had been vibrating with excitement both on the plane (Tony&rsquo;s private one of course, he wouldn&rsquo;t be caught dead flying commercial) and in the lobby of the hotel. So much so that Stephen was afraid the teen would shimmy right out of his skin or that he and Tony would have to invest in a child leash.</p><p>The thought made the sorcerer chuckle and Peter gave him a confused glance.</p><p>The teen&rsquo;s vibrating excitement was quickly turning into nervous fidgeting once Tony started yelling at the hotel receptionist though. Apparently they had overbooked and the rooms they reserved a few days ago were not available. So Stephen decided to drag Peter over to the fountain while Tony took care of the rooming issue (and carefully watch in case things got too heated and he needed to step in) and quietly hands the boy some change. He knew Peter well enough to know he would want to do something as traditional as throwing pennies into the fountain, but Tony didn&rsquo;t carry change.</p><p>He probably didn&rsquo;t even know what it looked like anymore.</p><p>Stephen and Peter spend the next few minutes flicking change into the water until the teen looks over his shoulder to look at Tony, then turns to the sorcerer. &ldquo;Umm&hellip;Mom?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Dad took off his sunglasses.&rdquo;</p><p>Stephen whips his head around to look toward the front desk and quickly notices the growing look of terror on the receptionist&rsquo;s face. That wasn&rsquo;t good. Tony only ever took off his sunglasses to intimidate someone and he did not want to be kicked out of the hotel. So he rushes over to the desk after telling Peter not to move, and he quickly claps a hand over the engineer&rsquo;s mouth at his next words.</p><p>&ldquo;You see my kid over there?! I wanted to give him the time of his life, but you assholes&ndash;mmph!&rdquo;</p><p>The employee looks up at Stephen with some relief when the sorcerer smiles gently. &ldquo;Do you have any rooms available?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes. There is one with two beds.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s <i>fine</i>.&rdquo; He says the last word with emphasis toward his muffled boyfriend. &ldquo;Mistakes happen. Like a piece of equipment short-circuiting.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony narrows his eyes at Stephen before licking the hand over his mouth, and the sorcerer pulls his hand away with a grimace. The engineer slams his card onto the counter and Stephen takes the key cards, as well as Tony&rsquo;s card, from the receptionist when the transaction is finished.</p><p>&ldquo;Peter deserves the best.&rdquo; Tony finally grumbles as they walk over to join the teen at the fountain.</p><p>&ldquo;You forget that he would be happy in a motel. He&rsquo;s still not used to having money.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony&rsquo;s eyes widen. &ldquo;Wait! Aren&rsquo;t parents supposed to give their kids allowances?! No wonder he&rsquo;s not used to money!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You practically give him a daily allowance. Just this morning you threw a one hundred dollar bill at him because he was talking about a new Lego set he wanted.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;&hellip;I have no memory of that.&rdquo;</p><p>Stephen sighs. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s because you turned your need to give Peter everything into a subconscious reflex. He actually caught on and tries not to tell you about anything he might want.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony smiles. &ldquo;Shit&hellip;I don&rsquo;t deserve this kid.&rdquo; The genius then tilts his head curiously. &ldquo;How come he&rsquo;s excited about the trip then?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I told him it was a reward for his grades.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Clever.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been known to have my moments.&rdquo;</p><p>Stephen knew that Tony had a smart-ass retort on the tip of his tongue, but the man wisely kept his mouth shut. When they approach Peter at the fountain, he jumps into excited chatter about there being fish in the fountain as Tony leads them to the elevators with a fond smile. Even before Peter became a permanent part of their family, Tony always tried to give him the world. The teen had lost so much of his family and missed out on vacations and school trips because May had trouble keeping up with his metabolism (she had to juggle two jobs) and Peter felt so bad that he never asked for anything. Not even things he needed. He eventually let it slip around Stephen about something he was missing and the sorcerer took it upon himself to tell Tony.</p><p>After May died, it took a couple of months for Peter to get used to the fact that he could eat as much as he wanted, and it took two more for him to start asking for things he <i>needed</i>. It was still a work in progress to get the boy to ask for something he wanted. That was probably what started Tony&rsquo;s habit of throwing money at Peter whenever he mentioned something in passing. Ninety percent of the time, Peter refused the money, and Tony got whatever is was he wanted for him anyway. </p><p>They exit the elevator when it reaches their floor, and when they finally reach their room, Peter snatches one of the key cards out of Stephen&rsquo;s hand and opens the door. With an excited whoop, the teen drops his bag by the bed closest to the window and flops onto it before rolling around on it.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not a teenager. That&rsquo;s a dog.&rdquo; Tony grins. &ldquo;Hey Underoos, find the room service menu. You and Mama Bear can order something while I take a shower.&rdquo;</p><p>The humanoid ball of energy responds with a vigorous nod and flitters around the room while Tony ducks into the bathroom with one of his bags and Stephen carries the rest to the other bed. He throws Tony&rsquo;s on the bedside closest to the door (the man felt better knowing if someone came in, he was the one they would have to get through to get to his family) and sits with a relieved groan as he watches Peter finally pick up the menu on the minibar. The teen quickly sits next to the sorcerer and the two figure out what they want, and then Stephen calls it in as Peter retreats to his own bed.</p><p>He flops facedown onto it, buries his face into the pillow&hellip;and jetlag finally catches up with him. Quiet snores fill the room as Stephen leisurely lays back against his pillows and turns on the tv, and he looks up at Tony with amusement when the man walks out of the bathroom in a tank top and boxers.</p><p>&ldquo;That didn&rsquo;t take long.&rdquo;</p><p>Stephen smirks. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s given the phrase &lsquo;crash and burn&rsquo; a new meaning.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Might as well let him sleep until dinner gets here.&rdquo; Tony pushes his bag off the bed and joins his boyfriend on the bed. &ldquo;Did you get something for me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No. I figured I&rsquo;d let you starve.&rdquo; Stephen replies sarcastically.</p><p>The engineer gasps dramatically. &ldquo;This is the thanks I get after everything I do for you two? Leeches! The both of you! You&rsquo;re as bad as the rest of the team!&rdquo; Stephen rolls his eyes and then pulls Tony in for a kiss. When they pull apart moments later, the genius grumbles. &ldquo;Well at least I get <i>something</i> for my trouble.&rdquo;</p><p>The sorcerer laughs and throws one of the decorative pillows at him. &ldquo;Incorrigible. Just for that I&rsquo;m giving your food to Peter.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you dare.&rdquo;</p><p>A knock on the door echoes into the room and Tony darts out of bed, only for Stephen to lunge at him and tackle him to the floor. The loud thud of their bodies hitting the floor wakes Peter with a start, and the teen drowsily crawls off the bed and pauses in front of his wrestling parents.</p><p>&ldquo;&hellip;I don&rsquo;t want to know.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Dinner is here kiddo&ndash;ow my ribs!&ndash;go get it would you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Uh&hellip;sure.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter rubs his eyes as he opens the door and stops the employee before he can push the cart into the room. &ldquo;I can take it.&rdquo; </p><p>He pulls the food cart in and out of the way before grabbing his meal, stealing the remote from his parents bed, and sitting at the table by the window to eat. He didn&rsquo;t even raise an eyebrow when there was another loud thunk. He didn&rsquo;t know why Stephen and Tony were screwing around, but he wasn&rsquo;t about to ask and get in the middle of it. It would be their fault if their dinner got cold.</p><p>&ldquo;The universe has given me psychos for parents.&rdquo; Peter mutters.</p><p>&ldquo;I heard that!&rdquo; Tony yells. &ldquo;Ow! Babe&hellip;my ribs.&rdquo;</p>",

So much so that Stephen was afraid the teen would shimmy right out of his skin or that he and Tony would have to invest in a child leash.</p><p>The thought made the sorcerer chuckle and Peter gave him a confused glance.</p><p>The teen\u2019s vibrating excitement was quickly turning into nervous fidgeting once Tony started yelling at the hotel receptionist though. Apparently they had overbooked and the rooms they reserved a few days ago were not available. So Stephen decided to drag Peter over to the fountain while Tony took care of the rooming issue (and carefully watch in case things got too heated and he needed to step in) and quietly hands the boy some change. He knew Peter well enough to know he would want to do something as traditional as throwing pennies into the fountain, but Tony didn\u2019t carry change.</p><p>He probably didn\u2019t even know what it looked like anymore.</p><p>Stephen and Peter spend the next few minutes flicking change into the water until the teen looks over his shoulder to look at Tony, then turns to the sorcerer. \u201cUmm\u2026Mom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad took off his sunglasses.\u201d</p><p>Stephen whips his head around to look toward the front desk and quickly notices the growing look of terror on the receptionist\u2019s face.

It was one of the stories that influenced me growing up, and maybe it influenced this fic a little bit, too. Just a little xD</p><p>For lack of alternatives, I&rsquo;m using the &ldquo;Free for All&rdquo; square on my <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mQHO0lPewYgFn1jVPALC9pA\">@ironstrangebingo</a> card (/sobs discreetly because I&rsquo;d wanted to save that\n square for last T_T)</p><p>***</p><p>A long time ago, in the middle of a vast and isolated desert, there was a land made almost entirely of clockwork.</p><p>It may sound funny, but it&rsquo;s true.</p><p>Grain mills, water wheels, and vehicles used to transport wares and \npeople, were run with clockwork machinery. Some citizens even lived with\n parts of their bodies made of clockwork.</p><p>That wasn&rsquo;t all - there were soldiers, laborers, entertainers, teachers, and doctors that were made of clockwork.</p><p>They looked like humans, sometimes behaved like humans - but they \nwere not human. Their skin was metal, their guts steel receptacles and \nwire, and their blood the dark lifeblood of the desert, which the \ncitizens of the kingdom called &ldquo;oil.&rdquo;</p><p>The secret of making these human-like clockwork creatures was so \nintricate and so intimately kept, that it could not be replicated - only\n the people of this kingdom knew about it, and could make it with their \nown two hands.</p><p>The land was prosperous, because its people took the concept of time \nto heart. Its people acted precisely, down to the last second, not \nmissing a beat, moving as parts of a great machine - and they took joy \nin it, thinking it a noble purpose.</p><p>This land was ruled by a king and his son.</p><p>The King was ruthless and cold. He used his clockwork armies to \nconquer other nearby kingdoms. He exiled or executed anyone who rebelled\n against the very strict timelines he imposed.</p><p>His people agreed: it was his brutality that made him great.</p><p>The Prince was not as cold. But he, too, dreamed of greatness.</p><p>But where his father dreamed of being feared, he dreamed of being loved.</p><p>He made his own clockwork creations with his own two hands - things \nthat did not seek to kill, or conquer, but instead sought to protect, to\n preserve, and to create other things in turn.</p><p>The Prince looked at them and thought: &ldquo;With these, I can become a great king. An even greater king than my father is.&rdquo;</p><p>***</p><p>Now, the Prince had a friend.</p><p>This friend had been his rival, when they were still in school.</p><p>Where the Prince was friendly and jovial, the friend was stern and severe.</p><p>They both knew much about clockwork, but thought of it differently.</p><p>The friend believed that clockwork beings had no heart, and existed only to serve those that did.</p><p>The Prince disagreed.</p><p>&ldquo;Hearts can be grown,&rdquo; the Prince argued. &ldquo;You can see it in how affection builds even where there was none before.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Humans are not made of clockwork,&rdquo; the friend argued back. &ldquo;Clockwork is simple. Affection is not.&rdquo;</p><p>In a way, the friend was right. Affections were not simple.</p><p>They both saw this in how they were drawn to each other, how they \nsought each other out, in spite of their disagreements, their many \ndifferences.</p><p>But in a way, the Prince was also right. Hearts could be grown.</p><p>They both saw this in how they were constantly in each other&rsquo;s thoughts, how they found themselves growing ever closer.</p><p>***</p><p>[<a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/19071118\">Read the rest @AO3</a>]<br /></p>",
