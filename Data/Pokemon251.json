Just decided we may as well get this out of the way, since there&rsquo;s only two Mega evolutions we haven&rsquo;t touched, belonging to Diancie and Necrozma (Ultra Necrozma being very functionally similar to a Mega).</p><p>Gen 6 is gonna be a peculiar beast. To date, it&rsquo;s the shortest generation, having only 72 new Pokemon, but decidedly making up for that lost number by giving 50 previous Pokemon these new Mega Evolutions, as a temporary form change that increases their stats and gives them new abilities. And this direction to take was one I have mixed reaction to. It&rsquo;s a sound idea, but Megas were often given to already pretty popular and/or pretty powerful Pokemon so only a handful of Pokemon actually in need of a power boost got one. It also winds up being a rather selfish mechanic, given only a handful of Pokemon could get one. And if your favorite just happens to not be the sort of Pokemon Gamefreak expect your favorite to be, then that\u2019s just too bad.</p><p>Admittedly, I wasn&rsquo;t keen on the idea at first. Maybe because none of the Mega forms they first showed off were particularly good at selling the idea to me. I did significantly warm up to the idea when they revealed Mega Kangaskhan. Now, I&rsquo;ve grown to like a few of them. Outright dislike others. The whole Mega Evolutions roster is a mixed bag. Some of them build off of their base form nicely, while others either do nothing for the Pokemon in question or just turn them into an overdesigned mess. Which is pretty bad on Pokemon that already straddle that line pretty hard like Rayquaza or Garchomp.</p><p>And interestingly enough, now through Gen 7, we&rsquo;ve gotten no new Mega Evolutions. Apart from, of course, Ultra Necrozma, but it\u2019s kinda up in the air of they consider that an official\u00a0\u201cMega\u201d even if Ultra Necrozma is functionally very much the same thing. Does this mean Megas won&rsquo;t be a recurring thing, just a one-and-done feature for X and Y? It&rsquo;s sounding likely. But they also probably wanted to make way for the Z-Move feature, Alolan Forms, and Ultra Beasts. But with how much X and Y were forcefully involved with Sun and Moon, you&rsquo;d think Mega Evolution would play a part in it. I wouldn\u2019t say no to new Megas in Gen 8, especially since we also seem to be done with Legacy Evolutions too. And there\u2019s still plenty of Pokemon that could use a much-needed boost in power.</p><p>I am glad I decided to cover them in the way I did. They aren&rsquo;t as absolutely vital to Kalos&rsquo;s flavor as much as Alolan Forms are to Alola. But also they would be meaning I&rsquo;d have to do a lot of redraws back to back<i> to back</i> for some of these. PLUS, that&rsquo;d be around 38 individual reviews, even if I lumped related Megas together into one. Nah, I&rsquo;d like the hypothetical Mega Block to be done within a month, thank you very much.</p><p>But, let&rsquo;s go ahead and do a list breakdown of these things!</p><hr><h2><b>Top 10 Favorite Megas:</b></h2><figure data-orig-width=\"1289\" data-orig-height=\"552\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/165ea30ff64446e0a68d4fd659a1b01e/tumblr_inline_pfb8f9P5V51qd0gcp_1280.png\" data-orig-width=\"1289\" data-orig-height=\"552\"/></figure><p>It might be cheating since these Megas are Megas of Pokemon I already liked a lot. But still, a very fun and cool bunch! I&rsquo;m still thoroughly happy Sceptile&rsquo;s didn&rsquo;t get butchered. That handful of Megas that boosted a Pokemon\u2019s cool-factor without going <i>overboard</i> is really nice.</p><hr><h2><b>Bottom 10 Least Favorite Megas:</b></h2><figure data-orig-width=\"1289\" data-orig-height=\"552\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/dcbf886ca509e1d7f94b32ea28a75b4f/tumblr_inline_pfb8icnYpq1qd0gcp_1280.png\" data-orig-width=\"1289\" data-orig-height=\"552\"/></figure><p>Or at least, the latter four might just be the Megas I feel add the least to their previous forms. Gallade is still Gallade, Steelix is a jumbled confused mess, Latios and Latias are clones now more than ever, and Meditite just. Doesn&rsquo;t look good. The rest just end up looking real doofy in how hard they tried to make them look cool.</p><hr><h2><b>The Most Creative Ones:</b></h2><figure data-orig-width=\"838\" data-orig-height=\"552\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/68829c75d62dabbc1dcc540436b05706/tumblr_inline_pfb8l9nanA1qd0gcp_1280.png\" data-orig-width=\"838\" data-orig-height=\"552\"/></figure><p>I wish there were more Megas like these fellas. Yeah, let it say something about the creative effort of the Megas when \u201chas wings now\u201d is on this list.</p><hr><h2><b>Most Deserved:</b></h2><figure data-orig-width=\"838\" data-orig-height=\"552\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e99806f2f8521d97f8565c3d3f8c395d/tumblr_inline_pfb8mq23q01qd0gcp_1280.png\" data-orig-width=\"838\" data-orig-height=\"552\"/></figure><p>This group right here also probably get the best out of getting a boost in power level. They needed a stat boost to keep up, and by george they got one. Kangaskhan even became notorious for being one of the most broken Megas in the game for its abuse of getting to use Power-Up Punch twice in one turn.</p><hr><h2><b>Least Deserved:</b></h2><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"552\" data-orig-width=\"838\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e508fbe56c63b05c4cc213e21b9bf940/tumblr_inline_pfb8p7cLAa1qd0gcp_1280.png\" data-orig-height=\"552\" data-orig-width=\"838\"/></figure><p>Not gonna count Legendaries, since they tend to get special treatment anyway that a few were bound to get Megas. But aren&rsquo;t these Pokemon either A. Already stupidly powerful enough, so giving them a Mega form only makes them even more busted? Or B. Already super popular, thus are hogging limelight that could be given to some old-forgottens some much-needed love.</p><p>Or they\u2019re both!</p><hr><h2><b>Pokemon I&rsquo;m Surprised DIDN&rsquo;T Get Megas:</b></h2><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1280\" data-orig-width=\"1280\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/6f49fa9e1b3ca97108e11ef5ffbc64a8/tumblr_inline_pfb8ugwJaq1qd0gcp_1280.png\" data-orig-height=\"1280\" data-orig-width=\"1280\"/></figure><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1016\" data-orig-width=\"1016\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/01dfea49c140a14a25b7cd95dfbe73f5/tumblr_inline_pfb8wxmls21qd0gcp_1280.png\" data-orig-height=\"1016\" data-orig-width=\"1016\"/></figure><p>You&rsquo;d think for this big Mega Evolution push they would&rsquo;ve gotten their mascot on board for it, but nope, actually!</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"229\" data-orig-width=\"500\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/c4af7641c51ae84fbc46246e3fd654be/tumblr_inline_pfb8xuther1qd0gcp_1280.png\" data-orig-height=\"229\" data-orig-width=\"500\"/></figure><p>These two are beloved classics, I&rsquo;m surprised they didn&rsquo;t receive Megas for their popularity among Gen 1 fans alone.

Felt like they were a bit of an unofficial trifecta of Pokemon of three stages and using the trading mechanic to evolve. I won\u2019t lose sleep over it of course, but. Who knows, maybe it was considered but they couldn\u2019t settle on a design.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1280\" data-orig-width=\"1280\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/41e6ceebcf7ab9f16cde01328bcf6bce/tumblr_inline_pfb91xzLpD1qd0gcp_1280.png\" data-orig-height=\"1280\" data-orig-width=\"1280\"/></figure><p>Again, Lapras feels like both one of Gen 1&rsquo;s flagship Pokemon while also being a little less known than say, Charizard or Mewtwo.

One of Gen 3&rsquo;s most popular Pokemon, and being Dragon that&rsquo;s sadly far outclassed by most others. It\u2019s painful being a fan of Flygon and seeing no Megas come out of XY. But then ORAS reveals there\u2019s more Megas to come! But STILL no dice. It was even outright said there was going to be a Mega Flygon but they couldn\u2019t settle on one design. Which is CRIMES. You\u2019ve thrown more than one Mega at a Pokemon before, Gamefreak! Just give Flygon an X and Y mega! One for it being the expected route where it remains a Dragon/Ground type, and the COOL ONE that becomes more insectoid and becomes the Dragon/<i>BUG TYPE IT WAS MEANT TO BE.</i></p><h2><b>CRIMES.</b></h2><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"431\" data-orig-width=\"431\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/beeda458392ed6cb3056f691682ac7cf/tumblr_inline_pfb9di83R41qd0gcp_1280.png\" data-orig-height=\"431\" data-orig-width=\"431\"/></figure><p>I&rsquo;ll elaborate further later, but again. One of Gen 3&rsquo;s most popular monsters. No Mega! It seems so bizarre that a good chunk of the ORAS Mega expansion had so many Megas that aren\u2019t even Pokemon that live in Hoenn and yet Hoenn fandom faves like Flygon and Milotic get left out.

Another thing is that Zoroark is sadly not very viable in battle. Because you get to see your opponent&rsquo;s team before a battle ingame anyway, Zoroark loses almost all of its surprise factor since it&rsquo;ll cast next to no one off guard so long as they know Zoroark is on their opponent&rsquo;s team. So why not my Mega Zoroark a burst-damage attacker that deals a significant amount of damage as its first move busting out of its vanilla form&rsquo;s illusion.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"431\" data-orig-width=\"431\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/7b703e31ce549fe7b379707c2682a8f2/tumblr_inline_pfb9t7YWwf1qd0gcp_1280.png\" data-orig-height=\"431\" data-orig-width=\"431\"/></figure><p>To this day, it&rsquo;s still an absolute crime that Magnezone cannot acquire Levitate.

So harsh weather could sneeze on the thing and it&rsquo;ll keel over. And sadly, given the Mega Evolution rule, no Mega Evolution gets an upgrade to its HP probably due to some programming issues of increasing the thing&rsquo;s max HP mid-fight. But something I may propose is the shell falling onto the ground, while the Mega-Evolved soul of Shedinja arises from the thing&rsquo;s back. Its MAX HP increased, but its HP is still at 1. So it uses a new ability that gives turns all moves into HP-suckers like Leech Life or the like so that it can eat some HP back up. Either that, or keep its HP at one, ditch its pointless Defense stats in favor of super-boosting its Attack, Special Attack, and Speed.

Or growing a third head and becoming Neapolitan! The only bum thing about giving it a secondary typing is that its moveset isn&rsquo;t very diverse, so maybe you&rsquo;d have to shoe-horn in letting it be able to learn Lava Plume or Power Gem somewhere in there to give it a decent STAB move.

Sadly, Vespiquen&rsquo;s been plagued with the disadvantage of being assigned a more defensive role with a terrible, TERRIBLE defensive typing in Bug/Flying. If you didn&rsquo;t want to just convert it into an attacker from Mega Evolving, you could boost its Defenses and give it a new Bug/Steel typing.

It could just go absolutely bonkers and look absolutely broken and reality-bending, with its stability only becoming worse. Alternatively, you could throw a double-whammey in there and also give Porygon 2 a Mega to be a stand-out NFE Mega. It\u2019d also make sense for Silph Co to develop a Mega Porygon 2 that would be completely inaccessible for people that illegally evolved their Porygon 2, but then an even more illegal Porgon-Z Mega pops up so they could Mega Evolve their Porygon-Zs.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"431\" data-orig-width=\"431\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/8d6dffe267d874f84a3d85e323ec487e/tumblr_inline_pfbaquztmu1qd0gcp_1280.png\" data-orig-height=\"431\" data-orig-width=\"431\"/></figure><p>Again, might&rsquo;ve been in the \u201cSurprised No Mega\u201d group, but I can understand that Unown&rsquo;s more of a Pokemon with a collection gimmick than an actual attempt at making it competitively viable.

And while it still only has Hidden Power, it could have an ability where its attacks gain additional effects based on which letter that Mega-Evolved, or is the core of the swarm. A could lower the target&rsquo;s Attack or something, P applying Paralysis, Z giving its Hidden Power more finishing power, doing more damage the lower the opponent&rsquo;s HP is.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1080\" data-orig-width=\"1080\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/cb91ab24264b56f824998064ed4d193a/tumblr_inline_pfbatp5O1g1qd0gcp_1280.png\" data-orig-height=\"1080\" data-orig-width=\"1080\"/></figure><p>A common suggestion for a lesser Pokemon to get a Mega.

But allow the thing&rsquo;s nubby little wings to become full-on angelic and giant. Just this dopey little fat snake flying around on huge wings. I do approve of the consensus of giving it a Dragon type though.

And above all, Garbodor needs a Mega more than most, since it could use the stat boost and the change in typing to give it more realized bulk. Easy enough to give the thing torn shreds of a trash can or dumpster to use as armor and give it a Poison/Steel typing! As for an ability, you could give it something that tends to its Garbage-eating ways! When it makes physical contact with its target, it could steal the opponent&rsquo;s item and just eat it. OR. Once sent out into battle, instead of taking damage from Spikes or Stealth Rock, it EATS the Spikes and Stealth Rocks! And Toxic Spikes too of course. He\u2019s the trash man that just comes out and eats all the garbage.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"431\" data-orig-width=\"431\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/81d4b5ba062334dd7e9d0e0a87485842/tumblr_inline_pfbbfb8BCg1qd0gcp_1280.png\" data-orig-height=\"431\" data-orig-width=\"431\"/></figure><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"417\" data-orig-width=\"417\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/283ba0f48c81b619a4c0e913de4154e5/tumblr_inline_pfbbfz0bko1qd0gcp_1280.png\" data-orig-height=\"417\" data-orig-width=\"417\"/></figure><p>Technically cheating here, but \u00a0I feel like if one were to get a Mega, the other would have to as well. And again, perhaps some spoilers on my high opinion on these two, but given they&rsquo;re Halloweenyness, I can&rsquo;t imagine the fact that I love these two is much of a surprise. But still, anything that would make Trevenant a bulky, frankentree maybe with even more faces on it. A vengeful tree spirit! And Gourgeist, while remaining Grass/Ghost, could pick up more Fire type traits like a burning candle-head, and more emphasis on its belly-mouth.

So forgotten, Farfetch&rsquo;d is often requested to receive a Mega but Dewgong is left behind in that hype department. And I really do wanna like Dewgong! You could give it a Mega with more graceful features, taking its flowey fin parts and making it look more dress-like and fancy. Admittedly, that&rsquo;s all I got.

Just decided we may as well get this out of the way, since there\u2019s only two Mega evolutions we haven\u2019t touched, belonging to Diancie and Necrozma (Ultra Necrozma being very functionally similar to a Mega).</p><p>Gen 6 is gonna be a peculiar beast. To date, it\u2019s the shortest generation, having only 72 new Pokemon, but decidedly making up for that lost number by giving 50 previous Pokemon these new Mega Evolutions, as a temporary form change that increases their stats and gives them new abilities. And this direction to take was one I have mixed reaction to. It\u2019s a sound idea, but Megas were often given to already pretty popular and/or pretty powerful Pokemon so only a handful of Pokemon actually in need of a power boost got one. It also winds up being a rather selfish mechanic, given only a handful of Pokemon could get one. And if your favorite just happens to not be the sort of Pokemon Gamefreak expect your favorite to be, then that\u2019s just too bad.</p><p>Admittedly, I wasn\u2019t keen on the idea at first. Maybe because none of the Mega forms they first showed off were particularly good at selling the idea to me. I did significantly warm up to the idea when they revealed Mega Kangaskhan. Now, I\u2019ve grown to like a few of them. Outright dislike others. The whole Mega Evolutions roster is a mixed bag. Some of them build off of their base form nicely, while others either do nothing for the Pokemon in question or just turn them into an overdesigned mess. Which is pretty bad on Pokemon that already straddle that line pretty hard like Rayquaza or Garchomp.</p><p>And interestingly enough, now through Gen 7, we\u2019ve gotten no new Mega Evolutions. Apart from, of course, Ultra Necrozma, but it\u2019s kinda up in the air of they consider that an official\u00a0\u201cMega\u201d even if Ultra Necrozma is functionally very much the same thing. Does this mean Megas won\u2019t be a recurring thing, just a one-and-done feature for X and Y? It\u2019s sounding likely. But they also probably wanted to make way for the Z-Move feature, Alolan Forms, and Ultra Beasts. But with how much X and Y were forcefully involved with Sun and Moon, you\u2019d think Mega Evolution would play a part in it. I wouldn\u2019t say no to new Megas in Gen 8, especially since we also seem to be done with Legacy Evolutions too. And there\u2019s still plenty of Pokemon that could use a much-needed boost in power.</p><p>I am glad I decided to cover them in the way I did. They aren\u2019t as absolutely vital to Kalos\u2019s flavor as much as Alolan Forms are to Alola. But also they would be meaning I\u2019d have to do a lot of redraws back to back<i> to back</i> for some of these. PLUS, that\u2019d be around 38 individual reviews, even if I lumped related Megas together into one. Nah, I\u2019d like the hypothetical Mega Block to be done within a month, thank you very much.</p><p>But, let\u2019s go ahead and do a list breakdown of these things!</p><hr><h2><b>Top 10 Favorite Megas:</b></h2><figure data-orig-width=\"1289\" data-orig-height=\"552\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/165ea30ff64446e0a68d4fd659a1b01e/tumblr_inline_pfb8f9P5V51qd0gcp_1280.png\" data-orig-width=\"1289\" data-orig-height=\"552\"></figure><p>It might be cheating since these Megas are Megas of Pokemon I already liked a lot.

So harsh weather could sneeze on the thing and it\u2019ll keel over. And sadly, given the Mega Evolution rule, no Mega Evolution gets an upgrade to its HP probably due to some programming issues of increasing the thing\u2019s max HP mid-fight. But something I may propose is the shell falling onto the ground, while the Mega-Evolved soul of Shedinja arises from the thing\u2019s back. Its MAX HP increased, but its HP is still at 1. So it uses a new ability that gives turns all moves into HP-suckers like Leech Life or the like so that it can eat some HP back up. Either that, or keep its HP at one, ditch its pointless Defense stats in favor of super-boosting its Attack, Special Attack, and Speed.

Or growing a third head and becoming Neapolitan! The only bum thing about giving it a secondary typing is that its moveset isn\u2019t very diverse, so maybe you\u2019d have to shoe-horn in letting it be able to learn Lava Plume or Power Gem somewhere in there to give it a decent STAB move.

Alternatively, you could throw a double-whammey in there and also give Porygon 2 a Mega to be a stand-out NFE Mega. It\u2019d also make sense for Silph Co to develop a Mega Porygon 2 that would be completely inaccessible for people that illegally evolved their Porygon 2, but then an even more illegal Porgon-Z Mega pops up so they could Mega Evolve their Porygon-Zs.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"431\" data-orig-width=\"431\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/8d6dffe267d874f84a3d85e323ec487e/tumblr_inline_pfbaquztmu1qd0gcp_1280.png\" data-orig-height=\"431\" data-orig-width=\"431\"></figure><p>Again, might\u2019ve been in the \u201cSurprised No Mega\u201d group, but I can understand that Unown\u2019s more of a Pokemon with a collection gimmick than an actual attempt at making it competitively viable.

And while it still only has Hidden Power, it could have an ability where its attacks gain additional effects based on which letter that Mega-Evolved, or is the core of the swarm.

But allow the thing\u2019s nubby little wings to become full-on angelic and giant. Just this dopey little fat snake flying around on huge wings. I do approve of the consensus of giving it a Dragon type though.

As for an ability, you could give it something that tends to its Garbage-eating ways! When it makes physical contact with its target, it could steal the opponent\u2019s item and just eat it. OR. Once sent out into battle, instead of taking damage from Spikes or Stealth Rock, it EATS the Spikes and Stealth Rocks! And Toxic Spikes too of course.

Just decided we may as well get this out of the way, since there\u2019s only two Mega evolutions we haven\u2019t touched, belonging to Diancie and Necrozma (Ultra Necrozma being very functionally similar to a Mega).</p><p>Gen 6 is gonna be a peculiar beast. To date, it\u2019s the shortest generation, having only 72 new Pokemon, but decidedly making up for that lost number by giving 50 previous Pokemon these new Mega Evolutions, as a temporary form change that increases their stats and gives them new abilities. And this direction to take was one I have mixed reaction to. It\u2019s a sound idea, but Megas were often given to already pretty popular and/or pretty powerful Pokemon so only a handful of Pokemon actually in need of a power boost got one. It also winds up being a rather selfish mechanic, given only a handful of Pokemon could get one. And if your favorite just happens to not be the sort of Pokemon Gamefreak expect your favorite to be, then that\u2019s just too bad.</p><p>Admittedly, I wasn\u2019t keen on the idea at first. Maybe because none of the Mega forms they first showed off were particularly good at selling the idea to me. I did significantly warm up to the idea when they revealed Mega Kangaskhan. Now, I\u2019ve grown to like a few of them. Outright dislike others. The whole Mega Evolutions roster is a mixed bag. Some of them build off of their base form nicely, while others either do nothing for the Pokemon in question or just turn them into an overdesigned mess. Which is pretty bad on Pokemon that already straddle that line pretty hard like Rayquaza or Garchomp.</p><p>And interestingly enough, now through Gen 7, we\u2019ve gotten no new Mega Evolutions. Apart from, of course, Ultra Necrozma, but it\u2019s kinda up in the air of they consider that an official\u00a0\u201cMega\u201d even if Ultra Necrozma is functionally very much the same thing. Does this mean Megas won\u2019t be a recurring thing, just a one-and-done feature for X and Y? It\u2019s sounding likely. But they also probably wanted to make way for the Z-Move feature, Alolan Forms, and Ultra Beasts. But with how much X and Y were forcefully involved with Sun and Moon, you\u2019d think Mega Evolution would play a part in it. I wouldn\u2019t say no to new Megas in Gen 8, especially since we also seem to be done with Legacy Evolutions too. And there\u2019s still plenty of Pokemon that could use a much-needed boost in power.</p><p>I am glad I decided to cover them in the way I did. They aren\u2019t as absolutely vital to Kalos\u2019s flavor as much as Alolan Forms are to Alola. But also they would be meaning I\u2019d have to do a lot of redraws back to back<i> to back</i> for some of these. PLUS, that\u2019d be around 38 individual reviews, even if I lumped related Megas together into one. Nah, I\u2019d like the hypothetical Mega Block to be done within a month, thank you very much.</p><p>But, let\u2019s go ahead and do a list breakdown of these things!</p><hr><h2><b>Top 10 Favorite Megas:</b></h2><figure data-orig-width=\"1289\" data-orig-height=\"552\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/165ea30ff64446e0a68d4fd659a1b01e/tumblr_inline_pfb8f9P5V51qd0gcp_1280.png\" data-orig-width=\"1289\" data-orig-height=\"552\"></figure><p>It might be cheating since these Megas are Megas of Pokemon I already liked a lot.

What\u2019s up with that?

Another thing is that Zoroark is sadly not very viable in battle. Because you get to see your opponent\u2019s team before a battle ingame anyway, Zoroark loses almost all of its surprise factor since it\u2019ll cast next to no one off guard so long as they know Zoroark is on their opponent\u2019s team.

So harsh weather could sneeze on the thing and it\u2019ll keel over. And sadly, given the Mega Evolution rule, no Mega Evolution gets an upgrade to its HP probably due to some programming issues of increasing the thing\u2019s max HP mid-fight. But something I may propose is the shell falling onto the ground, while the Mega-Evolved soul of Shedinja arises from the thing\u2019s back. Its MAX HP increased, but its HP is still at 1. So it uses a new ability that gives turns all moves into HP-suckers like Leech Life or the like so that it can eat some HP back up. Either that, or keep its HP at one, ditch its pointless Defense stats in favor of super-boosting its Attack, Special Attack, and Speed.

The only bum thing about giving it a secondary typing is that its moveset isn\u2019t very diverse, so maybe you\u2019d have to shoe-horn in letting it be able to learn Lava Plume or Power Gem somewhere in there to give it a decent STAB move.

It\u2019d also make sense for Silph Co to develop a Mega Porygon 2 that would be completely inaccessible for people that illegally evolved their Porygon 2, but then an even more illegal Porgon-Z Mega pops up so they could Mega Evolve their Porygon-Zs.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"431\" data-orig-width=\"431\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/8d6dffe267d874f84a3d85e323ec487e/tumblr_inline_pfbaquztmu1qd0gcp_1280.png\" data-orig-height=\"431\" data-orig-width=\"431\"></figure><p>Again, might\u2019ve been in the \u201cSurprised No Mega\u201d group, but I can understand that Unown\u2019s more of a Pokemon with a collection gimmick than an actual attempt at making it competitively viable.

And while it still only has Hidden Power, it could have an ability where its attacks gain additional effects based on which letter that Mega-Evolved, or is the core of the swarm.

As for an ability, you could give it something that tends to its Garbage-eating ways! When it makes physical contact with its target, it could steal the opponent\u2019s item and just eat it. OR. Once sent out into battle, instead of taking damage from Spikes or Stealth Rock, it EATS the Spikes and Stealth Rocks! And Toxic Spikes too of course.

Just decided we may as well get this out of the way, since there&rsquo;s only two Mega evolutions we haven&rsquo;t touched, belonging to Diancie and Necrozma (Ultra Necrozma being very functionally similar to a Mega).</p><p>Gen 6 is gonna be a peculiar beast. To date, it&rsquo;s the shortest generation, having only 72 new Pokemon, but decidedly making up for that lost number by giving 50 previous Pokemon these new Mega Evolutions, as a temporary form change that increases their stats and gives them new abilities. And this direction to take was one I have mixed reaction to. It&rsquo;s a sound idea, but Megas were often given to already pretty popular and/or pretty powerful Pokemon so only a handful of Pokemon actually in need of a power boost got one. It also winds up being a rather selfish mechanic, given only a handful of Pokemon could get one. And if your favorite just happens to not be the sort of Pokemon Gamefreak expect your favorite to be, then that&rsquo;s just too bad.</p><p>Admittedly, I wasn&rsquo;t keen on the idea at first. Maybe because none of the Mega forms they first showed off were particularly good at selling the idea to me. I did significantly warm up to the idea when they revealed Mega Kangaskhan. Now, I&rsquo;ve grown to like a few of them. Outright dislike others. The whole Mega Evolutions roster is a mixed bag. Some of them build off of their base form nicely, while others either do nothing for the Pokemon in question or just turn them into an overdesigned mess. Which is pretty bad on Pokemon that already straddle that line pretty hard like Rayquaza or Garchomp.</p><p>And interestingly enough, now through Gen 7, we&rsquo;ve gotten no new Mega Evolutions. Apart from, of course, Ultra Necrozma, but it&rsquo;s kinda up in the air of they consider that an official&nbsp;&ldquo;Mega&rdquo; even if Ultra Necrozma is functionally very much the same thing. Does this mean Megas won&rsquo;t be a recurring thing, just a one-and-done feature for X and Y? It&rsquo;s sounding likely. But they also probably wanted to make way for the Z-Move feature, Alolan Forms, and Ultra Beasts. But with how much X and Y were forcefully involved with Sun and Moon, you&rsquo;d think Mega Evolution would play a part in it. I wouldn&rsquo;t say no to new Megas in Gen 8, especially since we also seem to be done with Legacy Evolutions too. And there&rsquo;s still plenty of Pokemon that could use a much-needed boost in power.</p><p>I am glad I decided to cover them in the way I did. They aren&rsquo;t as absolutely vital to Kalos&rsquo;s flavor as much as Alolan Forms are to Alola. But also they would be meaning I&rsquo;d have to do a lot of redraws back to back<i> to back</i> for some of these. PLUS, that&rsquo;d be around 38 individual reviews, even if I lumped related Megas together into one. Nah, I&rsquo;d like the hypothetical Mega Block to be done within a month, thank you very much.</p><p>But, let&rsquo;s go ahead and do a list breakdown of these things!</p><hr /><h2><b>Top 10 Favorite Megas:</b></h2><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/165ea30ff64446e0a68d4fd659a1b01e/tumblr_inline_pfb8f9P5V51qd0gcp_1280.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>It might be cheating since these Megas are Megas of Pokemon I already liked a lot.

So harsh weather could sneeze on the thing and it&rsquo;ll keel over. And sadly, given the Mega Evolution rule, no Mega Evolution gets an upgrade to its HP probably due to some programming issues of increasing the thing&rsquo;s max HP mid-fight. But something I may propose is the shell falling onto the ground, while the Mega-Evolved soul of Shedinja arises from the thing&rsquo;s back. Its MAX HP increased, but its HP is still at 1. So it uses a new ability that gives turns all moves into HP-suckers like Leech Life or the like so that it can eat some HP back up. Either that, or keep its HP at one, ditch its pointless Defense stats in favor of super-boosting its Attack, Special Attack, and Speed.

The two &ldquo;royal guard&rdquo; combee could act as essentially a free Substitute upon Mega Evolving, or is like Mimikyu&rsquo;s Disguise ability where the guards will eat up one attack per battle.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/4120075bd98f4307c2fab420e47cae03/tumblr_inline_pfbakv20jo1qd0gcp_1280.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>While Porygon-Z is a definitely a favorite, I&rsquo;d say this one would be quite deserved given that darn Eviolite item&rsquo;s goofiness. Because now Porygon 2 is actually more competitively viable than Porygon-Z is. Which may be the way Silph Co liked it, but Porygon-Z&rsquo;s got plenty of Mega potential as a glitch-monster. It could just go absolutely bonkers and look absolutely broken and reality-bending, with its stability only becoming worse. Alternatively, you could throw a double-whammey in there and also give Porygon 2 a Mega to be a stand-out NFE Mega. It&rsquo;d also make sense for Silph Co to develop a Mega Porygon 2 that would be completely inaccessible for people that illegally evolved their Porygon 2, but then an even more illegal Porgon-Z Mega pops up so they could Mega Evolve their Porygon-Zs.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/8d6dffe267d874f84a3d85e323ec487e/tumblr_inline_pfbaquztmu1qd0gcp_1280.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Again, might&rsquo;ve been in the &ldquo;Surprised No Mega&rdquo; group, but I can understand that Unown&rsquo;s more of a Pokemon with a collection gimmick than an actual attempt at making it competitively viable. But I still think there&rsquo;s some missed potential in allowing a sole Unown be able to call upon a whole swarm of alphabet soup like its often shown doing in the anime and games. And while it still only has Hidden Power, it could have an ability where its attacks gain additional effects based on which letter that Mega-Evolved, or is the core of the swarm. A could lower the target&rsquo;s Attack or something, P applying Paralysis, Z giving its Hidden Power more finishing power, doing more damage the lower the opponent&rsquo;s HP is.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/cb91ab24264b56f824998064ed4d193a/tumblr_inline_pfbatp5O1g1qd0gcp_1280.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>A common suggestion for a lesser Pokemon to get a Mega. But so many wanna turn Dunsparce into a badass and I can only say <i>NO</i>. If I were to make a Mega Dunsparce, I&rsquo;d be down with giving it a relatively unchanged design, maybe some touch-ups like a bigger drill-tail or being generally longer. But allow the thing&rsquo;s nubby little wings to become full-on angelic and giant. Just this dopey little fat snake flying around on huge wings. I do approve of the consensus of giving it a Dragon type though. We need quirkier Dragons.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/826bdbcbe5bb42faf02dc427d679a653/tumblr_inline_pfbaw5EIjE1qd0gcp_1280.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>If nothing else, for having the phrase &ldquo;Mega Yanmega&rdquo; being uttered ingame mid-battle as if you oughta take this situation seriously. But for real, Yanmega&rsquo;s so badass as is, I&rsquo;d take a simple self-indulgent Mega that just makes it even cooler, even buggier, even more lizard-like. And it <i>WILL</i> be Bug/Dragon you ABSOLUTE<i> COWARDS.</i></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/67f50d1b26cef5843f23328f3e734982/tumblr_inline_pfbayomjDg1qd0gcp_1280.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Like I said in my review of the thing, poor guy got side-lined pretty hard. Even in its own Generation, Druddigon is outclassed by nearly every Dragon in the game. Screw Salamence and Garchomp, it&rsquo;s THIS fella that needs a Mega! And it can fully realize its Gargoyley ways! Dragon/Rock type and everything. Even with already learning a couple Rock moves, inserting more wouldn&rsquo;t be that thematically weird!</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/ab50aa14ed1d7e19455aa49ef8ef8020/tumblr_inline_pfbb1fbfDA1qd0gcp_1280.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>It&rsquo;s just such a shame a cool Pokemon like Skarmory just falls harder and harder into irrelevancy and forgotteness. A problem a shiny new Mega would fix, even. Plus, with Skarmory already having a big of a&nbsp;&ldquo;helmet&rdquo; on, I could easily see adding on a bit of a knightly theme to it working out quite well. Its even already got some sword-like wings. AND AND it&rsquo;s thematic given this gen takes place in Europe as well!</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/09295af2e73435438d5681734688216f/tumblr_inline_pfbbb1rK1C1qd0gcp_1280.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Gen 5 just needs more Megas in general, my dude! And above all, Garbodor needs a Mega more than most, since it could use the stat boost and the change in typing to give it more realized bulk. Easy enough to give the thing torn shreds of a trash can or dumpster to use as armor and give it a Poison/Steel typing! As for an ability, you could give it something that tends to its Garbage-eating ways! When it makes physical contact with its target, it could steal the opponent&rsquo;s item and just eat it. OR. Once sent out into battle, instead of taking damage from Spikes or Stealth Rock, it EATS the Spikes and Stealth Rocks! And Toxic Spikes too of course. He&rsquo;s the trash man that just comes out and eats all the garbage.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/81d4b5ba062334dd7e9d0e0a87485842/tumblr_inline_pfbbfb8BCg1qd0gcp_1280.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/283ba0f48c81b619a4c0e913de4154e5/tumblr_inline_pfbbfz0bko1qd0gcp_1280.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Technically cheating here, but &nbsp;I feel like if one were to get a Mega, the other would have to as well. And again, perhaps some spoilers on my high opinion on these two, but given they&rsquo;re Halloweenyness, I can&rsquo;t imagine the fact that I love these two is much of a surprise. But still, anything that would make Trevenant a bulky, frankentree maybe with even more faces on it. A vengeful tree spirit! And Gourgeist, while remaining Grass/Ghost, could pick up more Fire type traits like a burning candle-head, and more emphasis on its belly-mouth. Spooky!</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/39aa092ab1e5f0e398ffd76cf9af5480/tumblr_inline_pfbbgwOgu11qd0gcp_1280.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>And&hellip; here&rsquo;s a vote solely for a Pokemon down on its luck. So forgotten, Farfetch&rsquo;d is often requested to receive a Mega but Dewgong is left behind in that hype department. And I really do wanna like Dewgong! You could give it a Mega with more graceful features, taking its flowey fin parts and making it look more dress-like and fancy. Admittedly, that&rsquo;s all I got. Dewgong&rsquo;s not got a lot to work with, sadly.</p><p>But at any rate, for real this time. Next Friday, we&rsquo;re moving onto Gen 6!</p><p>\n\n[<a href=\"https://inikavulpixelreviews.tumblr.com/The%20Pokedex\">Archive</a>]\n\n<br /></p></p>",

But mostly just funny shit.\nI draw video games, IRL stuff, random fandoms and NSFW, sometimes. Lots of stuff really.\nResponse is usually fast unless I'm doing something. Might have to wait for an hour or so. But if it's something big, like going to the hospital or a tragedy, I usually post about it after the event has passed or when it's less stressful.\nRoleplay is private (NSFW and/or SFW). I RP mostly one liners to paragraphs. Genre is an open bag for me.\nAlso sorry for the bad art. I'm just using what I have and to the best of my ability.\nAnonymous are allowed!\n(Description may change randomly.
