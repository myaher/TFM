        "body": "<p>It was the day I\u2019d been waiting weeks for. Today was my last Friday before I started my eight week long paid time off. \u00a0All the extra nights and weekends of overtime had finally paid off and I had enough hours saved up to take six continuous weeks off with an extra two weeks of my annual leave for a combined total of eight weeks. \u00a0I was practically dancing to the elevator as I left my office. \u00a0Of course, even though I would be free from the stress-filled office, I promised to help Sam at the caf\u00e9 which meant taking coffee and pastry orders but at least I would get a break from staring at computer screens all day. \u00a0I had planned to start my commute home when a text from Sam had me heading to the shop instead. \u00a0One of her few waitresses had called out and she needed someone to man the register while she baked more pastries. \u00a0</p><p>I arrived at the shop a few minutes after 6 p.m. to see the cafe was crowded. \u00a0A sea of people filled the shop including some of the regulars, among them an college student who stayed for hours doing homework, an elderly man and his friends who came in every few days for coffee and pastries and a group of moms who stopped in after their yoga classes to drink tea while they waited for their kids to get out of school. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cNic! I\u2019m so glad you\u2019re here! Grab an apron! I need some help getting these muffins into the oven!\u201d Sam called to me from behind the register. \u00a0The apron she was wearing was covered in flour and what looked like coffee ground and chocolate sauce. \u00a0I could tell she was struggling so I grabbed an apron and joined her in the back. \u00a0\u201cYou won\u2019t believe how many people are coming in and demanding chocolate muffins right now. \u00a0We\u2019re sold out but they insist that they\u2019ll wait the twenty minutes it\u2019ll take for me to make more. \u00a0My arms hurt from how much batter I\u2019ve had to mix for all this. \u00a0I still have to get through this rush and start prep for tomorrow. \u00a0It\u2019s going to be a long night for me. \u00a0If you hadn\u2019t come over, I think would have just started crying in the back.\u201d \u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine, I was going to start coming in to help tomorrow anyway, this is just an early start to prepare me for the weekend rush. Besides, it\u2019s nice to see some familiar faces out there.\u201d I said as helped Sam lift a few trays of muffins into the oven. \u201cHow many muffins is this? This many could feed more than the whole crowd out there.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s twenty-four on each pan and fourteen pans so a little over three hundred muffins. \u00a0It should last us for the next few hours if not the whole night. \u00a0Thanks for helping me get these in the oven. \u00a0I think I can handle everything back here if you could help out in the front, I\u2019m pretty sure we can make it through this rush. \u00a0Take these scones to William and his friends?\u201d </p><p>I nodded and headed back out front with the plates of scones to deliver to William. \u00a0William and his friends were regulars at the shop that came in early some days and never seemed to leave. \u00a0They were an elderly group who met up and reminisced about their youth in the shop. \u00a0They always had stories about growing up in the 20s and always took the time to ask you after you. \u00a0It was kind of like having your grandfather around at the shop telling you stories and giving you advice. \u00a0I found William\u2019s table outside and set the scones down on their table. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cNicole, what are you doing here? Sam using you for free labor again?\u201d William joked as he reached for the scone in front of him. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou know Sam, if she could, she\u2019d lock me in the back and never let me leave. \u00a0Who else can keep up with her books and help her bake everything? Are you guys out of coffee? Let me bring you some more, I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d \u00a0I turned to see a blonde man at the table next to William\u2019s that I had never seen before drawing absently in a sketchbook and noticed his coffee cup was almost empty. \u00a0I went back inside and made sure the coffee pot was full before heading back out to refill the blonde man\u2019s coffee cup as well as William\u2019s and his friends but when I returned the blonde man was gone. \u00a0All that was left was his cup and a tip. \u00a0</p><p>~~~</p><p>The next morning found me back at the shop working the morning rush alongside Sam and another waitress named Christine. \u00a0Usually, I was on the customer buying coffee and bagel and wading through the crowd to pick up my order versus being the one yelling out orders into a sea of people hoping the right customer would hear me and come to counter. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cChristine, can you grab more egg bagels from the back? We\u2019re running low out here.\u201d I called to her as she brought back two empty coffee pots. \u00a0We were packed for carry out orders and seated diners making things hectic to navigate. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou got it, Nicole, gimme a sec, I\u2019ll be right back!\u201d She took off towards the kitchen after setting more coffee to brew. \u201cWhen those finish, can you set up some pots of black tea?\u201d I yelled an affirmative and took the next customer\u2019s order before heading to the beverage station to brew the tea for Christine. As I filled the tea kettle with water, I noticed through the window, \u00a0William and his friends take a seat at one of the tables outside and made a mental note to prepare their usual order for Christine to bring to them after I finished with the current customer rush. \u00a0</p><p>By the time we had finished with the morning rush, I had almost forgotten William and the other old-timers were outside and decided to take a moment to refill everyone\u2019s coffee. \u00a0As I stepped outside, I noticed the blonde man was back. \u00a0As I got closer, I could see he was still drawing absently in a sketchbook. \u00a0I wondered what he could be drawing since he had a sad look on his face while glancing up at Stark Tower. \u00a0But before I could ask, William called out to me and I turned away to refill his group\u2019s cups and help settle their debate on which pie was better, apple or blueberry? \u00a0</p><p>After the debate settled, I turned and noticed the blonde\u2019s coffee was almost empty and knew this was my chance to start a conversation with him. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cWaiting on the big guy?\u201d I said as I approached his table.</p><p>\u201cMa\u2019am?\u201d The blonde man looked up at me with a look of confusion in his bright blue eyes.</p><p>\u201cIron Man. A lot of people eat here just to see him fly by.\u201d He looked a little disgusted as I mentioned Iron Man. \u2018Not a fan of Tony Stark then I guess.\u2019 </p><p>\u201cRight, maybe another time.\u201d He said as he reached for his wallet. </p><p>\u201cThe tables all yours as long as you like. Nobody\u2019s waiting on it.\u201d I reached over to fill</p><p>his cup, \u201cPlus, we\u2019ve got free wireless.\u201d I said turning to head back inside. </p><p>\u201cRadio?\u201d The blonde man asked with a confused look on his face. I just gave him a small confused smile and went to the next table.</p><p>\u2018 Wireless Radio?\u2019 I thought to myself, \u2018Aren\u2019t all radios wireless? Who carries radios anymore?\u2019 I refilled another customers cup and headed back inside. </p><p>\u201cAsk for her number, you moron.\u201d I heard William say to the blonde man over his shoulder. I laughed to myself. It was just like William to intervene in other people\u2019s lives. But I had to admit, I was curious about the blonde man. There\u2019s no way a guy like him didn\u2019t have a soulmate. </p><p>~~~</p><p>I dreamed again about Roger. He was still spending nights at the gym destroying punching bags. Except for this time, he was talking to himself. </p><p>\u201cI can just go back tomorrow. Things are different now.\u201d I wondered what he was talking about. </p><p>\u201cI should have asked for her name.\u201d \u2018Asked her name? Whose?\u2019</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re different now, you\u2019re bigger than you used to be. You can ask a beautiful woman for her number or on a date now.\u201d \u00a0\u2018Ask a beautiful woman on a date? Is he planning to ask someone out? But doesn\u2019t he know I exist?\u2019 I felt hurt that I had waited this long to find my soulmate just to watch him make plans to ask another woman out. He had to know I existed right? Didn\u2019t he see my life now? He had to if he stayed up this late, he had to sleep during the day when I was awake and heading to work. Maybe he was tired of waiting for me and was looking for a chosen mate instead? Of course, this would be my life. \u00a0</p><p>I jerked awake to the sound of my alarm going off. \u00a0I lay in bed for a minute contemplating how I felt about Roger asking another woman out on a date. \u00a0Maybe he couldn\u2019t see me in his dreams. After all, I hadn\u2019t seen him until now, maybe he doesn\u2019t know I exist and is trying to be happy without a soulmate. I rolled out of bed and got dressed. \u00a0I could smell Rachel making coffee and headed out to the kitchen. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cHey Nic, why are you up so early? I thought you were off for the next few weeks?\u201d Rachel called over her shoulder as she flipped her omelette. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cI am but I\u2019m helping Sam out until she can get things sorted out and hire a few more people to help out.\u201d \u00a0I poured myself a cup of coffee and took a seat at the table.</p><p>\u201cOh yeah, how\u2019s that going? I know things have been rough opening the shop since her grandparents passed.\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going well actually, the caf\u00e9 is always packed in the morning and evening rush hours and she\u2019s got some regulars. \u00a0It could just be because she just opened the shop but I believe it\u2019s because of her family recipes. Remember her family\u2019s apple pie recipe?\u201d I paused to take a sip of coffee. \u00a0It was terrible, Rachel should stick to just making eggs. </p><p>\u201cHer grandmother\u2019s apple pie? It\u2019s to die for! When you first brought some home, I thought it was going be generic diner pie like any other greasy spoon in New York but that pie was amazing!\u201d \u00a0Rachel gushed while sliding her omelette to a plate. </p><p>\u201cYeah, she actually found her family\u2019s recipe book with all of her family\u2019s recipes going back a few generations. \u00a0All of the pastries they sell are from her family\u2019s recipes and they are just as good as her grandmother\u2019s pie. You should bring Mike by sometime to try it.\u201d Rachel snorted.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think Mike is going to believe anything is better than his grammy\u2019s cooking. But maybe when the office isn\u2019t so busy, we\u2019ll stop by. \u00a0I feel like I barely see anyone besides my co-workers and my bed. I\u2019m barely getting sleep these days. Speaking of sleep, have you had any dreams about Roger?\u201d She asked starting to cut and eat her omelette.</p><p>\u201cI\u2026 I don\u2019t know.\u201d I sighed. </p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean you don\u2019t know? Either you dreamed about him or you didn\u2019t.\u201d She said giving me a look. </p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ve been dreaming about him boxing at an old gym but I can\u2019t tell where it is.\u201d </p><p>\u201cA boxing gym? That\u2019s a start though. So a guy into World War 2 and hangs out at an old boxing gym. What\u2019s wrong with that?\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just\u2026 last night, I had a dream, he was in the gym but he was talking to himself.\u201d Rachel made a face. \u201cNo, not like that. \u00a0It sounded like he was trying to\u2026 I don\u2019t know trying to build up the courage to ask another woman out on a date.\u201d I said staring into my coffee cup. </p><p>\u201cWhat?! Are you sure? Oh Nic, I\u2019m sorry. \u00a0I know how long you\u2019ve been waiting to find out if you had a soulmate and now this.\u201d \u00a0She got up hugged me. \u201cWhat are you going to do? Do you just want to wait and see if you cross paths or do you want to try to find him?\u201d </p><p>I hesitated, \u201cI think I want\u2026 to try to find him. \u00a0I\u2019ve waited this long and I gave up on even having a soul mate. Now, I know I have one and it&rsquo;s been months since I found out. \u00a0I should start looking for him. Maybe he\u2019s going out with someone else because he\u2019s seen that I\u2019m not looking for him. \u00a0Maybe he thinks that because I\u2019m not looking for him, I&rsquo;m not interested in him. \u00a0After I finish helping Sam at the caf\u00e9, I\u2019m going to spend the rest of my time-off looking for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNic, that\u2019s great! You know I\u2019ll help you right? I\u2019m amazing at finding everyone\u2019s secret Facebook page. \u00a0If he\u2019s on social media, I\u2019ll find him. \u00a0I\u2019ll find out everything about him. \u00a0Maybe we can find him and watch him from afar to see if he\u2019s crazy or not.\u201d \u00a0I shot her a look, \u201cHey, you said he was talking to himself, hangs out in an old boxing gym and has a vintage army suit. \u00a0He could be cool but you have to admit that\u2019s a little weird. But, I\u2019ll see you when I get back, I have to get to the office early today. Let me know when we can start The Hunt so I know when to start digging into him! Bye!\u201d She said grabbing her bag and darting out the front door.</p><p>I sat at the table for a few minutes before pulling my phone from my pocket. \u00a0Who was Roger? I didn\u2019t even have a last name. I mean, his first name was muffled when I heard it, I could even have his first name wrong. \u00a0Should I check the soulmate forums? I didn\u2019t have much to go on aside from his vintage army suit and late night boxing workouts and that could be anyone in New York City. \u00a0I mulled it over for a few more minutes before pulling up a soulmate forum and writing a post. \u00a0</p><p>\u2018Looking for my soulmate in New York City. \u00a0You probably thought you were going to be alone forever. \u00a0I know you frequent the gym late at night to box and have a vintage collection of military suits. \u00a0If you\u2019ve seen me in your dreams, you know I work with numbers for a living. Message me, if you know what branch of the military the suits are from and where I work.\u2019 </p><p>Was it too vague or too revealing? It\u2019s true any guy in the city could go boxing late at night, but how many also collected vintage army suits and had an accountant soulmate? \u00a0Besides, if Roger had seen me in his dreams, the name of my firm was everywhere in my office, he had to know the name of the firm where I worked. \u00a0Hopefully, I\u2019d get a response or at least could weed out the creeps who used the website to scam people looking for their soulmate. \u00a0</p><p>I stared at the forum on my phone before tossing it on the table. \u00a0I guess all there was to do now was wait. </p>",

            "comment": "<p>It was the day I\u2019d been waiting weeks for. Today was my last Friday before I started my eight week long paid time off. \u00a0All the extra nights and weekends of overtime had finally paid off and I had enough hours saved up to take six continuous weeks off with an extra two weeks of my annual leave for a combined total of eight weeks. \u00a0I was practically dancing to the elevator as I left my office. \u00a0Of course, even though I would be free from the stress-filled office, I promised to help Sam at the caf\u00e9 which meant taking coffee and pastry orders but at least I would get a break from staring at computer screens all day. \u00a0I had planned to start my commute home when a text from Sam had me heading to the shop instead. \u00a0One of her few waitresses had called out and she needed someone to man the register while she baked more pastries. \u00a0</p><p>I arrived at the shop a few minutes after 6 p.m. to see the cafe was crowded. \u00a0A sea of people filled the shop including some of the regulars, among them an college student who stayed for hours doing homework, an elderly man and his friends who came in every few days for coffee and pastries and a group of moms who stopped in after their yoga classes to drink tea while they waited for their kids to get out of school. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cNic! I\u2019m so glad you\u2019re here! Grab an apron! I need some help getting these muffins into the oven!\u201d Sam called to me from behind the register. \u00a0The apron she was wearing was covered in flour and what looked like coffee ground and chocolate sauce. \u00a0I could tell she was struggling so I grabbed an apron and joined her in the back. \u00a0\u201cYou won\u2019t believe how many people are coming in and demanding chocolate muffins right now. \u00a0We\u2019re sold out but they insist that they\u2019ll wait the twenty minutes it\u2019ll take for me to make more. \u00a0My arms hurt from how much batter I\u2019ve had to mix for all this. \u00a0I still have to get through this rush and start prep for tomorrow. \u00a0It\u2019s going to be a long night for me. \u00a0If you hadn\u2019t come over, I think would have just started crying in the back.\u201d \u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine, I was going to start coming in to help tomorrow anyway, this is just an early start to prepare me for the weekend rush. Besides, it\u2019s nice to see some familiar faces out there.\u201d I said as helped Sam lift a few trays of muffins into the oven. \u201cHow many muffins is this? This many could feed more than the whole crowd out there.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s twenty-four on each pan and fourteen pans so a little over three hundred muffins. \u00a0It should last us for the next few hours if not the whole night. \u00a0Thanks for helping me get these in the oven. \u00a0I think I can handle everything back here if you could help out in the front, I\u2019m pretty sure we can make it through this rush. \u00a0Take these scones to William and his friends?\u201d </p><p>I nodded and headed back out front with the plates of scones to deliver to William. \u00a0William and his friends were regulars at the shop that came in early some days and never seemed to leave. \u00a0They were an elderly group who met up and reminisced about their youth in the shop. \u00a0They always had stories about growing up in the 20s and always took the time to ask you after you. \u00a0It was kind of like having your grandfather around at the shop telling you stories and giving you advice. \u00a0I found William\u2019s table outside and set the scones down on their table. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cNicole, what are you doing here? Sam using you for free labor again?\u201d William joked as he reached for the scone in front of him. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou know Sam, if she could, she\u2019d lock me in the back and never let me leave. \u00a0Who else can keep up with her books and help her bake everything? Are you guys out of coffee? Let me bring you some more, I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d \u00a0I turned to see a blonde man at the table next to William\u2019s that I had never seen before drawing absently in a sketchbook and noticed his coffee cup was almost empty. \u00a0I went back inside and made sure the coffee pot was full before heading back out to refill the blonde man\u2019s coffee cup as well as William\u2019s and his friends but when I returned the blonde man was gone. \u00a0All that was left was his cup and a tip. \u00a0</p><p>~~~</p><p>The next morning found me back at the shop working the morning rush alongside Sam and another waitress named Christine. \u00a0Usually, I was on the customer buying coffee and bagel and wading through the crowd to pick up my order versus being the one yelling out orders into a sea of people hoping the right customer would hear me and come to counter. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cChristine, can you grab more egg bagels from the back? We\u2019re running low out here.\u201d I called to her as she brought back two empty coffee pots. \u00a0We were packed for carry out orders and seated diners making things hectic to navigate. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou got it, Nicole, gimme a sec, I\u2019ll be right back!\u201d She took off towards the kitchen after setting more coffee to brew. \u201cWhen those finish, can you set up some pots of black tea?\u201d I yelled an affirmative and took the next customer\u2019s order before heading to the beverage station to brew the tea for Christine. As I filled the tea kettle with water, I noticed through the window, \u00a0William and his friends take a seat at one of the tables outside and made a mental note to prepare their usual order for Christine to bring to them after I finished with the current customer rush. \u00a0</p><p>By the time we had finished with the morning rush, I had almost forgotten William and the other old-timers were outside and decided to take a moment to refill everyone\u2019s coffee. \u00a0As I stepped outside, I noticed the blonde man was back. \u00a0As I got closer, I could see he was still drawing absently in a sketchbook. \u00a0I wondered what he could be drawing since he had a sad look on his face while glancing up at Stark Tower. \u00a0But before I could ask, William called out to me and I turned away to refill his group\u2019s cups and help settle their debate on which pie was better, apple or blueberry? \u00a0</p><p>After the debate settled, I turned and noticed the blonde\u2019s coffee was almost empty and knew this was my chance to start a conversation with him. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cWaiting on the big guy?\u201d I said as I approached his table.</p><p>\u201cMa\u2019am?\u201d The blonde man looked up at me with a look of confusion in his bright blue eyes.</p><p>\u201cIron Man. A lot of people eat here just to see him fly by.\u201d He looked a little disgusted as I mentioned Iron Man. \u2018Not a fan of Tony Stark then I guess.\u2019 </p><p>\u201cRight, maybe another time.\u201d He said as he reached for his wallet. </p><p>\u201cThe tables all yours as long as you like. Nobody\u2019s waiting on it.\u201d I reached over to fill</p><p>his cup, \u201cPlus, we\u2019ve got free wireless.\u201d I said turning to head back inside. </p><p>\u201cRadio?\u201d The blonde man asked with a confused look on his face. I just gave him a small confused smile and went to the next table.</p><p>\u2018 Wireless Radio?\u2019 I thought to myself, \u2018Aren\u2019t all radios wireless? Who carries radios anymore?\u2019 I refilled another customers cup and headed back inside. </p><p>\u201cAsk for her number, you moron.\u201d I heard William say to the blonde man over his shoulder. I laughed to myself. It was just like William to intervene in other people\u2019s lives. But I had to admit, I was curious about the blonde man. There\u2019s no way a guy like him didn\u2019t have a soulmate. </p><p>~~~</p><p>I dreamed again about Roger. He was still spending nights at the gym destroying punching bags. Except for this time, he was talking to himself. </p><p>\u201cI can just go back tomorrow. Things are different now.\u201d I wondered what he was talking about. </p><p>\u201cI should have asked for her name.\u201d \u2018Asked her name? Whose?\u2019</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re different now, you\u2019re bigger than you used to be. You can ask a beautiful woman for her number or on a date now.\u201d \u00a0\u2018Ask a beautiful woman on a date? Is he planning to ask someone out? But doesn\u2019t he know I exist?\u2019 I felt hurt that I had waited this long to find my soulmate just to watch him make plans to ask another woman out. He had to know I existed right? Didn\u2019t he see my life now? He had to if he stayed up this late, he had to sleep during the day when I was awake and heading to work. Maybe he was tired of waiting for me and was looking for a chosen mate instead? Of course, this would be my life. \u00a0</p><p>I jerked awake to the sound of my alarm going off. \u00a0I lay in bed for a minute contemplating how I felt about Roger asking another woman out on a date. \u00a0Maybe he couldn\u2019t see me in his dreams. After all, I hadn\u2019t seen him until now, maybe he doesn\u2019t know I exist and is trying to be happy without a soulmate. I rolled out of bed and got dressed. \u00a0I could smell Rachel making coffee and headed out to the kitchen. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cHey Nic, why are you up so early? I thought you were off for the next few weeks?\u201d Rachel called over her shoulder as she flipped her omelette. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cI am but I\u2019m helping Sam out until she can get things sorted out and hire a few more people to help out.\u201d \u00a0I poured myself a cup of coffee and took a seat at the table.</p><p>\u201cOh yeah, how\u2019s that going? I know things have been rough opening the shop since her grandparents passed.\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going well actually, the caf\u00e9 is always packed in the morning and evening rush hours and she\u2019s got some regulars. \u00a0It could just be because she just opened the shop but I believe it\u2019s because of her family recipes. Remember her family\u2019s apple pie recipe?\u201d I paused to take a sip of coffee. \u00a0It was terrible, Rachel should stick to just making eggs. </p><p>\u201cHer grandmother\u2019s apple pie? It\u2019s to die for! When you first brought some home, I thought it was going be generic diner pie like any other greasy spoon in New York but that pie was amazing!\u201d \u00a0Rachel gushed while sliding her omelette to a plate. </p><p>\u201cYeah, she actually found her family\u2019s recipe book with all of her family\u2019s recipes going back a few generations. \u00a0All of the pastries they sell are from her family\u2019s recipes and they are just as good as her grandmother\u2019s pie. You should bring Mike by sometime to try it.\u201d Rachel snorted.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think Mike is going to believe anything is better than his grammy\u2019s cooking. But maybe when the office isn\u2019t so busy, we\u2019ll stop by. \u00a0I feel like I barely see anyone besides my co-workers and my bed. I\u2019m barely getting sleep these days. Speaking of sleep, have you had any dreams about Roger?\u201d She asked starting to cut and eat her omelette.</p><p>\u201cI\u2026 I don\u2019t know.\u201d I sighed. </p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean you don\u2019t know? Either you dreamed about him or you didn\u2019t.\u201d She said giving me a look. </p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ve been dreaming about him boxing at an old gym but I can\u2019t tell where it is.\u201d </p><p>\u201cA boxing gym? That\u2019s a start though. So a guy into World War 2 and hangs out at an old boxing gym. What\u2019s wrong with that?\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just\u2026 last night, I had a dream, he was in the gym but he was talking to himself.\u201d Rachel made a face. \u201cNo, not like that. \u00a0It sounded like he was trying to\u2026 I don\u2019t know trying to build up the courage to ask another woman out on a date.\u201d I said staring into my coffee cup. </p><p>\u201cWhat?! Are you sure? Oh Nic, I\u2019m sorry. \u00a0I know how long you\u2019ve been waiting to find out if you had a soulmate and now this.\u201d \u00a0She got up hugged me. \u201cWhat are you going to do? Do you just want to wait and see if you cross paths or do you want to try to find him?\u201d </p><p>I hesitated, \u201cI think I want\u2026 to try to find him. \u00a0I\u2019ve waited this long and I gave up on even having a soul mate. Now, I know I have one and it\u2019s been months since I found out. \u00a0I should start looking for him. Maybe he\u2019s going out with someone else because he\u2019s seen that I\u2019m not looking for him. \u00a0Maybe he thinks that because I\u2019m not looking for him, I\u2019m not interested in him. \u00a0After I finish helping Sam at the caf\u00e9, I\u2019m going to spend the rest of my time-off looking for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNic, that\u2019s great! You know I\u2019ll help you right? I\u2019m amazing at finding everyone\u2019s secret Facebook page. \u00a0If he\u2019s on social media, I\u2019ll find him. \u00a0I\u2019ll find out everything about him. \u00a0Maybe we can find him and watch him from afar to see if he\u2019s crazy or not.\u201d \u00a0I shot her a look, \u201cHey, you said he was talking to himself, hangs out in an old boxing gym and has a vintage army suit. \u00a0He could be cool but you have to admit that\u2019s a little weird. But, I\u2019ll see you when I get back, I have to get to the office early today. Let me know when we can start The Hunt so I know when to start digging into him! Bye!\u201d She said grabbing her bag and darting out the front door.</p><p>I sat at the table for a few minutes before pulling my phone from my pocket. \u00a0Who was Roger? I didn\u2019t even have a last name. I mean, his first name was muffled when I heard it, I could even have his first name wrong. \u00a0Should I check the soulmate forums? I didn\u2019t have much to go on aside from his vintage army suit and late night boxing workouts and that could be anyone in New York City. \u00a0I mulled it over for a few more minutes before pulling up a soulmate forum and writing a post. \u00a0</p><p>\u2018Looking for my soulmate in New York City. \u00a0You probably thought you were going to be alone forever. \u00a0I know you frequent the gym late at night to box and have a vintage collection of military suits. \u00a0If you\u2019ve seen me in your dreams, you know I work with numbers for a living.

We\u2019re running low out here.\u201d I called to her as she brought back two empty coffee pots. \u00a0We were packed for carry out orders and seated diners making things hectic to navigate. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou got it, Nicole, gimme a sec, I\u2019ll be right back!\u201d She took off towards the kitchen after setting more coffee to brew. \u201cWhen those finish, can you set up some pots of black tea?\u201d I yelled an affirmative and took the next customer\u2019s order before heading to the beverage station to brew the tea for Christine. As I filled the tea kettle with water, I noticed through the window, \u00a0William and his friends take a seat at one of the tables outside and made a mental note to prepare their usual order for Christine to bring to them after I finished with the current customer rush. \u00a0</p><p>By the time we had finished with the morning rush, I had almost forgotten William and the other old-timers were outside and decided to take a moment to refill everyone\u2019s coffee. \u00a0As I stepped outside, I noticed the blonde man was back. \u00a0As I got closer, I could see he was still drawing absently in a sketchbook. \u00a0I wondered what he could be drawing since he had a sad look on his face while glancing up at Stark Tower. \u00a0But before I could ask, William called out to me and I turned away to refill his group\u2019s cups and help settle their debate on which pie was better, apple or blueberry? \u00a0</p><p>After the debate settled, I turned and noticed the blonde\u2019s coffee was almost empty and knew this was my chance to start a conversation with him. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cWaiting on the big guy?\u201d I said as I approached his table.</p><p>\u201cMa\u2019am?\u201d The blonde man looked up at me with a look of confusion in his bright blue eyes.</p><p>\u201cIron Man. A lot of people eat here just to see him fly by.\u201d He looked a little disgusted as I mentioned Iron Man. \u2018Not a fan of Tony Stark then I guess.\u2019 </p><p>\u201cRight, maybe another time.\u201d He said as he reached for his wallet. </p><p>\u201cThe tables all yours as long as you like. Nobody\u2019s waiting on it.\u201d I reached over to fill</p><p>his cup, \u201cPlus, we\u2019ve got free wireless.\u201d I said turning to head back inside. </p><p>\u201cRadio?\u201d The blonde man asked with a confused look on his face. I just gave him a small confused smile and went to the next table.</p><p>\u2018 Wireless Radio?\u2019 I thought to myself, \u2018Aren\u2019t all radios wireless? Who carries radios anymore?\u2019 I refilled another customers cup and headed back inside. </p><p>\u201cAsk for her number, you moron.\u201d I heard William say to the blonde man over his shoulder. I laughed to myself. It was just like William to intervene in other people\u2019s lives. But I had to admit, I was curious about the blonde man. There\u2019s no way a guy like him didn\u2019t have a soulmate. </p><p>~~~</p><p>I dreamed again about Roger. He was still spending nights at the gym destroying punching bags. Except for this time, he was talking to himself. </p><p>\u201cI can just go back tomorrow. Things are different now.\u201d I wondered what he was talking about. </p><p>\u201cI should have asked for her name.\u201d \u2018Asked her name? Whose?\u2019</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re different now, you\u2019re bigger than you used to be. You can ask a beautiful woman for her number or on a date now.\u201d \u00a0\u2018Ask a beautiful woman on a date? Is he planning to ask someone out? But doesn\u2019t he know I exist?\u2019 I felt hurt that I had waited this long to find my soulmate just to watch him make plans to ask another woman out. He had to know I existed right? Didn\u2019t he see my life now? He had to if he stayed up this late, he had to sleep during the day when I was awake and heading to work. Maybe he was tired of waiting for me and was looking for a chosen mate instead? Of course, this would be my life. \u00a0</p><p>I jerked awake to the sound of my alarm going off. \u00a0I lay in bed for a minute contemplating how I felt about Roger asking another woman out on a date. \u00a0Maybe he couldn\u2019t see me in his dreams. After all, I hadn\u2019t seen him until now, maybe he doesn\u2019t know I exist and is trying to be happy without a soulmate. I rolled out of bed and got dressed. \u00a0I could smell Rachel making coffee and headed out to the kitchen. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cHey Nic, why are you up so early? I thought you were off for the next few weeks?\u201d Rachel called over her shoulder as she flipped her omelette. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cI am but I\u2019m helping Sam out until she can get things sorted out and hire a few more people to help out.\u201d \u00a0I poured myself a cup of coffee and took a seat at the table.</p><p>\u201cOh yeah, how\u2019s that going? I know things have been rough opening the shop since her grandparents passed.\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going well actually, the caf\u00e9 is always packed in the morning and evening rush hours and she\u2019s got some regulars. \u00a0It could just be because she just opened the shop but I believe it\u2019s because of her family recipes. Remember her family\u2019s apple pie recipe?\u201d I paused to take a sip of coffee. \u00a0It was terrible, Rachel should stick to just making eggs. </p><p>\u201cHer grandmother\u2019s apple pie? It\u2019s to die for! When you first brought some home, I thought it was going be generic diner pie like any other greasy spoon in New York but that pie was amazing!\u201d \u00a0Rachel gushed while sliding her omelette to a plate. </p><p>\u201cYeah, she actually found her family\u2019s recipe book with all of her family\u2019s recipes going back a few generations. \u00a0All of the pastries they sell are from her family\u2019s recipes and they are just as good as her grandmother\u2019s pie. You should bring Mike by sometime to try it.\u201d Rachel snorted.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think Mike is going to believe anything is better than his grammy\u2019s cooking. But maybe when the office isn\u2019t so busy, we\u2019ll stop by. \u00a0I feel like I barely see anyone besides my co-workers and my bed. I\u2019m barely getting sleep these days. Speaking of sleep, have you had any dreams about Roger?\u201d She asked starting to cut and eat her omelette.</p><p>\u201cI\u2026 I don\u2019t know.\u201d I sighed. </p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean you don\u2019t know? Either you dreamed about him or you didn\u2019t.\u201d She said giving me a look. </p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ve been dreaming about him boxing at an old gym but I can\u2019t tell where it is.\u201d </p><p>\u201cA boxing gym? That\u2019s a start though. So a guy into World War 2 and hangs out at an old boxing gym. What\u2019s wrong with that?\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just\u2026 last night, I had a dream, he was in the gym but he was talking to himself.\u201d Rachel made a face. \u201cNo, not like that. \u00a0It sounded like he was trying to\u2026 I don\u2019t know trying to build up the courage to ask another woman out on a date.\u201d I said staring into my coffee cup. </p><p>\u201cWhat?! Are you sure? Oh Nic, I\u2019m sorry. \u00a0I know how long you\u2019ve been waiting to find out if you had a soulmate and now this.\u201d \u00a0She got up hugged me. \u201cWhat are you going to do? Do you just want to wait and see if you cross paths or do you want to try to find him?\u201d </p><p>I hesitated, \u201cI think I want\u2026 to try to find him. \u00a0I\u2019ve waited this long and I gave up on even having a soul mate. Now, I know I have one and it\u2019s been months since I found out. \u00a0I should start looking for him. Maybe he\u2019s going out with someone else because he\u2019s seen that I\u2019m not looking for him. \u00a0Maybe he thinks that because I\u2019m not looking for him, I\u2019m not interested in him. \u00a0After I finish helping Sam at the caf\u00e9, I\u2019m going to spend the rest of my time-off looking for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNic, that\u2019s great! You know I\u2019ll help you right? I\u2019m amazing at finding everyone\u2019s secret Facebook page. \u00a0If he\u2019s on social media, I\u2019ll find him. \u00a0I\u2019ll find out everything about him. \u00a0Maybe we can find him and watch him from afar to see if he\u2019s crazy or not.\u201d \u00a0I shot her a look, \u201cHey, you said he was talking to himself, hangs out in an old boxing gym and has a vintage army suit. \u00a0He could be cool but you have to admit that\u2019s a little weird. But, I\u2019ll see you when I get back, I have to get to the office early today. Let me know when we can start The Hunt so I know when to start digging into him! Bye!\u201d She said grabbing her bag and darting out the front door.</p><p>I sat at the table for a few minutes before pulling my phone from my pocket. \u00a0Who was Roger? I didn\u2019t even have a last name. I mean, his first name was muffled when I heard it, I could even have his first name wrong. \u00a0Should I check the soulmate forums? I didn\u2019t have much to go on aside from his vintage army suit and late night boxing workouts and that could be anyone in New York City. \u00a0I mulled it over for a few more minutes before pulling up a soulmate forum and writing a post. \u00a0</p><p>\u2018Looking for my soulmate in New York City. \u00a0You probably thought you were going to be alone forever. \u00a0I know you frequent the gym late at night to box and have a vintage collection of military suits. \u00a0If you\u2019ve seen me in your dreams, you know I work with numbers for a living. Message me, if you know what branch of the military the suits are from and where I work.\u2019 </p><p>Was it too vague or too revealing? It\u2019s true any guy in the city could go boxing late at night, but how many also collected vintage army suits and had an accountant soulmate? \u00a0Besides, if Roger had seen me in his dreams, the name of my firm was everywhere in my office, he had to know the name of the firm where I worked. \u00a0Hopefully, I\u2019d get a response or at least could weed out the creeps who used the website to scam people looking for their soulmate. \u00a0</p><p>I stared at the forum on my phone before tossing it on the table. \u00a0I guess all there was to do now was wait. </p>",
                "content": "<p>It was the day I&rsquo;d been waiting weeks for. Today was my last Friday before I started my eight week long paid time off. &nbsp;All the extra nights and weekends of overtime had finally paid off and I had enough hours saved up to take six continuous weeks off with an extra two weeks of my annual leave for a combined total of eight weeks. &nbsp;I was practically dancing to the elevator as I left my office. &nbsp;Of course, even though I would be free from the stress-filled office, I promised to help Sam at the caf&eacute; which meant taking coffee and pastry orders but at least I would get a break from staring at computer screens all day. &nbsp;I had planned to start my commute home when a text from Sam had me heading to the shop instead. &nbsp;One of her few waitresses had called out and she needed someone to man the register while she baked more pastries. &nbsp;</p><p>I arrived at the shop a few minutes after 6 p.m. to see the cafe was crowded. &nbsp;A sea of people filled the shop including some of the regulars, among them an college student who stayed for hours doing homework, an elderly man and his friends who came in every few days for coffee and pastries and a group of moms who stopped in after their yoga classes to drink tea while they waited for their kids to get out of school. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Nic! I&rsquo;m so glad you&rsquo;re here! Grab an apron! I need some help getting these muffins into the oven!&rdquo; Sam called to me from behind the register. &nbsp;The apron she was wearing was covered in flour and what looked like coffee ground and chocolate sauce. &nbsp;I could tell she was struggling so I grabbed an apron and joined her in the back. &nbsp;&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t believe how many people are coming in and demanding chocolate muffins right now. &nbsp;We&rsquo;re sold out but they insist that they&rsquo;ll wait the twenty minutes it&rsquo;ll take for me to make more. &nbsp;My arms hurt from how much batter I&rsquo;ve had to mix for all this. &nbsp;I still have to get through this rush and start prep for tomorrow. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s going to be a long night for me. &nbsp;If you hadn&rsquo;t come over, I think would have just started crying in the back.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine, I was going to start coming in to help tomorrow anyway, this is just an early start to prepare me for the weekend rush. Besides, it&rsquo;s nice to see some familiar faces out there.&rdquo; I said as helped Sam lift a few trays of muffins into the oven. &ldquo;How many muffins is this? This many could feed more than the whole crowd out there.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s twenty-four on each pan and fourteen pans so a little over three hundred muffins. &nbsp;It should last us for the next few hours if not the whole night. &nbsp;Thanks for helping me get these in the oven. &nbsp;I think I can handle everything back here if you could help out in the front, I&rsquo;m pretty sure we can make it through this rush. &nbsp;Take these scones to William and his friends?&rdquo; </p><p>I nodded and headed back out front with the plates of scones to deliver to William. &nbsp;William and his friends were regulars at the shop that came in early some days and never seemed to leave. &nbsp;They were an elderly group who met up and reminisced about their youth in the shop. &nbsp;They always had stories about growing up in the 20s and always took the time to ask you after you. &nbsp;It was kind of like having your grandfather around at the shop telling you stories and giving you advice. &nbsp;I found William&rsquo;s table outside and set the scones down on their table. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Nicole, what are you doing here? Sam using you for free labor again?&rdquo; William joked as he reached for the scone in front of him. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;You know Sam, if she could, she&rsquo;d lock me in the back and never let me leave. &nbsp;Who else can keep up with her books and help her bake everything? Are you guys out of coffee? Let me bring you some more, I&rsquo;ll be right back.&rdquo; &nbsp;I turned to see a blonde man at the table next to William&rsquo;s that I had never seen before drawing absently in a sketchbook and noticed his coffee cup was almost empty. &nbsp;I went back inside and made sure the coffee pot was full before heading back out to refill the blonde man&rsquo;s coffee cup as well as William&rsquo;s and his friends but when I returned the blonde man was gone. &nbsp;All that was left was his cup and a tip. &nbsp;</p><p>~~~</p><p>The next morning found me back at the shop working the morning rush alongside Sam and another waitress named Christine. &nbsp;Usually, I was on the customer buying coffee and bagel and wading through the crowd to pick up my order versus being the one yelling out orders into a sea of people hoping the right customer would hear me and come to counter. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Christine, can you grab more egg bagels from the back?

A lot of people eat here just to see him fly by.&rdquo; He looked a little disgusted as I mentioned Iron Man. &lsquo;Not a fan of Tony Stark then I guess.&rsquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Right, maybe another time.&rdquo; He said as he reached for his wallet. </p><p>&ldquo;The tables all yours as long as you like. Nobody&rsquo;s waiting on it.&rdquo; I reached over to fill</p><p>his cup, &ldquo;Plus, we&rsquo;ve got free wireless.&rdquo; I said turning to head back inside. </p><p>&ldquo;Radio?&rdquo; The blonde man asked with a confused look on his face. I just gave him a small confused smile and went to the next table.</p><p>&lsquo; Wireless Radio?&rsquo; I thought to myself, &lsquo;Aren&rsquo;t all radios wireless? Who carries radios anymore?&rsquo; I refilled another customers cup and headed back inside. </p><p>&ldquo;Ask for her number, you moron.&rdquo; I heard William say to the blonde man over his shoulder.

Whose?&rsquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re different now, you&rsquo;re bigger than you used to be.

All will be reader inserts.</p><p><b>Total Chapters: </b>30</p><p><b>Series warnings:</b>&nbsp;Fluff, angst, battle, graphic nightmare, panic attack, various shenanigans tagged in individual fics</p><p><b>Author&rsquo;s note:</b>&nbsp;This is going to be fun! Drabble requests will be put off for the month but I&rsquo;ll still be taking one-shot requests. All fics will be posted near the end of the day AKDT since I&rsquo;ll be writing them the day I post them and in the spirit of NaNoWriMo will be mostly unedited. To maintain my sanity, all my current WIPs will be on hiatus for the month.
