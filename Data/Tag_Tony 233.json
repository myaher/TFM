He can&rsquo;t help it. He hates the sight of it. He flinches everytime his gaze passes over it, and it looms in his life, an unforgettable reminder of the memory of it smashing through his arc reactor, the sharp crack of steel. It is the cause of the grating, niggling, and raspy whisper in the back of his mind that leaves him broken and teary at the dead of night with no one around. He remembers seeing that receding backside as Steve walks out of his life like he meant nothing to him. He remembers when he left him like everyone eventually does. He remembers the broken promises.</p><p>But he can&rsquo;t help it. He can&rsquo;t bear to push it somewhere where he cannot see it, he can&rsquo;t bear to shove it into one of the many closets he has within the tower, can&rsquo;t bear to go in any of the rooms where his family- the team- used to live in. He hasn&rsquo;t touched or let anyone touch those spaces within his tower, hurting too much to stay, broken too much to move on. Stuck. Tony had always known he was self-destructive. He let the wound fester and rot. He lets himself drift in the past. He knows it&rsquo;s unhealthy, self-destructive, and that it&rsquo;ll poison him, that it&rsquo;ll only lead to a painful, slow death, but he does it anyway. He&rsquo;s dying inside one way or another.</p><p>Steve comes into the lab with a plate and a cup, and it&rsquo;s the smell of heavenly caffeine that causes Tony to rise from the deep entrapment of numbers and code. Steve sets the plate down and hands Tony the cup of coffee into his hand, and he downs it. He goes back to his work with a mumbled thanks, but when Steve doesn&rsquo;t leave, he sighs. He&rsquo;s obviously waiting for him to eat. So Tony reaches over to pick up the sandwich, taking a bite idly, eyes on the screen. Steve laughs softly, then reaches over to wipe his mouth free of crumbs, a fondly exasperated look on his face rising from within.

He knows it\u2019s unhealthy, self-destructive, and that it\u2019ll poison him, that it\u2019ll only lead to a painful, slow death, but he does it anyway.

He\u2019s obviously waiting for him to eat. So Tony reaches over to pick up the sandwich, taking a bite idly, eyes on the screen.

Nine years old, and smarter than people thrice his age. He&rsquo;d get through this.</p><p><i>He&rsquo;d been kidnapped once before&hellip;</i></p><p>Scarcely three years old, too curious for his own good, slipped his nanny&rsquo;s supervision at just the wrong moment&hellip;</p><p>Too young to properly remember anything, though he had flashes of small details or emotion that could just have easily been nightmares based off the event as anything&hellip;</p><p>He didn&rsquo;t remember a Before any more than he remembered the event itself, not really. But he&rsquo;d been told that once, his mother had not been nearly so distant and lost in her own mind. That once, his father had&hellip; well. He fantasized sometimes that he father had once, if not loved, at least liked him. Before he proved himself a liability, a poor investment that his father could never fully divest.</p><p>(He did remember, all too well, the day not long after his seventh birthday that he&rsquo;d been informed by Jarvis he would begin at Idyllwild Academy in July. A year-round boarding school. A week for Thanksgiving, three for the autumn and the winter holidays respectively. Two for Spring. The only complete closure, a five week closure bridging June and July.)</p><p>(That first year, he&rsquo;d come home for every holiday.)</p><p>(Last year, he&rsquo;d only left for Thanksgiving and Christmas.)</p><p>(This year, he&rsquo;d skipped Thanksgiving and only returned to the mansion for Christmas.)</p><p>(Not that anyone, except for Jarvis and Ana, really seemed pleased by his presence.)</p><p><i>(How long until they stopped caring too?)</i></p><p>He tried to remember what he&rsquo;d been doing before this. His last memories before now.</p><p>The memories felt fuzzy, distant somehow, but&hellip;</p><p>He remembered a normal day of coursework. It was&hellip; early May? He&rsquo;d gotten into a fight with Ty, his roommate, over&hellip; Tony&rsquo;s arrogance?&hellip; that morning. He&rsquo;d shown up late to class in a wrinkled uniform because of it.</p><p>Mr. Dowan had been unhappy, lecturing him in front of the class about &ldquo;responsibility&rdquo; and &ldquo;laziness&rdquo; and how &ldquo;it doesn&rsquo;t matter how smart you are, Mr. Stark, if you can&rsquo;t even be bothered to behave and dress appropriately.&rdquo;</p><p>And he&rsquo;d been humiliated. Indignant. But hadn&rsquo;t bothered to argue, because arguing against those with authority over him had never helped him before, and that was hardly going to change now.</p><p>And then&hellip; what?</p><p>A normal day? Lunch, dinner, a trip outdoors or to the machine shop or the library? Returning to his room at the end of the day?</p><p>He&hellip; couldn&rsquo;t say for sure.</p><p>Which didn&rsquo;t bode well. He&rsquo;d seen in a movie, once, that people could repress especially-traumatic events from their minds entirely sometimes. He&rsquo;d researched it later, and it turned out to be a real-life, documented phenomenon.</p><p>If Tony was somewhere he didn&rsquo;t belong, and was obviously missing at least some amount of time&hellip;</p><p>Well.</p><p>His heart pounded thunderously in his chest.</p><p>Except&hellip; it felt wrong.</p><p>He looked down.</p><p>He was wearing an over-sized, dark grayed T-shirt. Equally ill-fitting- boxer shorts. </p><p>But&hellip; that wasn&rsquo;t what captured his attention.</p><p>A blue glow shone through the shirt.</p><p><i>Oh god&ndash;</i></p><p>His hands scrabbled at the shirt, revealing the device beneath.</p><p><i>Oh-god-oh-god-oh-god&ndash;</i></p><p>A circular, electric-blue device. Implanted in his chest. <i>In his body.</i></p><p><i>No-no-no-no-no&ndash;</i></p><p>Distantly, a part of him recognized that he was panicking.</p><p><i>Oh god was it a bomb he didn&rsquo;t want to die he didn&rsquo;t have this when he last remembered oh god what had these people done to him how was he even still alive where had his sternum gone the thing was huge and he could feel, now that he was paying attention, just how deep it went into him oh god&ndash;</i></p><p>He couldn&rsquo;t&ndash;</p><p><i>Get it out get it out get it out&ndash;</i></p><p>He didn&rsquo;t realize he was tearing at his chest, at the thing they&rsquo;d put in him, until he felt hands grabbing him, forcing his own away from the device. He thrashed, kicking and screaming and fighting for all that he was worth, fighting like his life depended on it because <i>it did&ndash;</i></p><p>It was getting harder and harder to breathe the more he fought. Spots in his vision, unable to hear anything but the ringing in his ears and an indecipherable stream of voices blending into his own terror&ndash;</p><p>He was getting light-headed from want of oxygen, his heart was going to beat from his chest,&nbsp;<i>he was going to die&ndash;</i></p><p>Anthony Edward Stark, age nine, lost consciousness.</p><p>The resultant silence was, in its own way, deafening.</p><p>Colonel James Rhodes looked down at the suddenly-limp figure beneath him. Pepper stood a few feet away, eyes wide with horror and filled with tears. </p><p><i>Well shit,</i> James thought. <i>Now what?</i></p>",

Three more to go.</p><p>You walked up the steps of the main building to get your first class, excited to see your friends from last year. With your books clutched to your chest, you wandered down the hall looking at each door to find the right room number.\u00a0Suddenly, you heard your name from one of the oncoming rooms and saw your friend Kim waving at you.\u00a0You smiled big and ran up to her, giving her a huge hug.</p><p>\u201cHey, [Y/N]! How was your summer?\u201d she asked you while the two of you walked in the class and sat down.<br/></p><p>\u201cIt was good. Got to spend it with the family at our lake house. How was yours?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cBoring as usual. And aggravating because of my little brother.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cIs Sarah here?\u201d you asked her.<br/></p><p>\u201cNo, not in this class. But she\u2019s in another one of our classes so we\u2019ll see her later.\u201d<br/></p><p>You glanced around the rest of the room, seeing quite a few new faces. And one of those new faces definitely caught your eye.</p><!-- more --><p>He was sitting a couple rows behind you, quietly flipping through the text book. His brown tousled hair, as crazy as it sounds, looked just perfect. And those eyes were perfect as well. Everything about him seemed to be. You just knew that you would have to get to know him.</p><p>You immediately turned to Kim and slightly nudged your head in his direction, asking who he was. She looked back and shrugged.</p><p>\u201cNew guy, I guess. I\u2019m sure the teacher will go through the class and have each of us say our names so we can know who each other is.\u201d<br/></p><p>And that\u2019s exactly what happened. 10 minutes later, the teacher walked in and had everyone announce their names.</p><p>\u201cTony Stark,\u201d the man said when his turn came. You immediately repeated the name over several times in your head before the teacher got to you. You almost said his name out loud when you stood up but quickly composed yourself before the embarrassment occurred.<br/></p><p>\u201c[Y/N] [Y/L/N],\u201d you said out loud, sitting back down as quick as possible.<br/></p><p>You glanced back at him and he noticed, giving you a small smile and wave. You smiled back and waved at him then turning around with your face feeling hot.</p><p>This was gonna be an interesting year for you.</p><hr><p>The next week you decided that you were gonna try and introduce yourself to Tony, after finally getting the courage to do it. So you walked into class right when the bell rang and sat in the seat next to him.\u00a0You looked over and smiled as you set your bag down and pulled out your textbook. He smiled back then focused on what the teacher started talking about.</p><p>When the\u00a0teacher\u2019s lecture was over and he assigned work for the class to do, you started working on it but was having a bit of trouble with a few of the problems. You figured this was the perfect time trying to talk to Tony and gently tapped his arm. He glanced over at you.</p><p>\u201cHey, Tony. I can\u2019t figure these out. You think you could help me?\u201d<br/></p><p>He gave a small smile and scooted over a bit towards you.\u00a0\u201cSure, [Y/N].\u201d</p><p>The two of you worked on your papers together for the rest of the class, getting to know a little bit more of each other in the process. When the bell rang for class to be over, he handed you a small piece of paper.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my number. Call me if you have any more questions on the assignment. Or if you just wanna study. I\u2019m free most nights.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d you said, feeling your face get hot.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ll add it to my contacts list.\u201d<br/></p><p>He nodded and started to turn to walk away but then you grabbed his wrist.\u00a0\u201cWait.\u201d</p><p>The two of you looked down at the situation and you immediately let go of his wrist, your entire body feeling flushed. You set your stuff down, ripped out a sheet of paper from your notebook and wrote down your number.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s mine,\u201d you stammered, looking down.\u00a0\u201cIf you wanna just hang out&hellip; maybe grab a coffee?\u201d<br/></p><p>Smiling, Tony took it and stuck it in his pocket.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019d like that, [Y/N].\u201d</p><p>You slowly looked up to see him walking away. And you couldn\u2019t help but stare at every muscle in his body, your eyes wandering lower until they were completely glued to his ass. Snapping yourself our of the daze that you were in, you went to the rest of your classes like you were walking on the clouds.</p><p>That night you called him and talked on the phone for over two hours. The conversation first started on the assignment but the went into personal things and learning more about each other. You never felt so giddy in your life; like you were back in high school.\u00a0And so started the budding friendship between the two of you.</p><p>You\u2019d spend as much time with him in class as possible, along with spending a little bit of time outside of it. And as the school year continued, you started to develop feelings for Tony. After all, you guys seemed to be inseparable when you were together in and out of the classroom; especially when it was the two of you hanging out in the spot underneath the oak tree on campus. People just started assuming that you two were a couple because of how much you were together. Even more so because of the way you would sit with Tony while you two studied; his head in your lap, your back against his chest, the way you\u2019d play with his hair and run your fingers through it.</p><p>This flirting went on for months between the two of you. And you loved every moment of it. You were practically putty in his hands and you couldn\u2019t help it. There was just something about him that you knew you wanted, yet could never get the words out. \u00a0\u00a0</p><p>And even though it seemed like Tony may have had those same feelings, he never once asked you out. You thought it was a bit strange but didn&rsquo;t want to be pushy about it so you never really asked or brought up the situation. That was until you finally found out why.</p><p>You saw him holding hands with a girl, one you\u2019d never seen before,\u00a0walking to the library. They talked and smiled and laughed with each other; and then standing in front of the doors, he kissed her on the lips. Immediately you turned around, not wanting to have that feeling of your heart sinking to the floor but it was to late. You walked away, feeling your stomach turn into knots.</p><p>Was he just playing with you and your feelings towards him? Never once did you think that he was playing you.\u00a0You never took him to be that kind of person. You considered Tony to be one that actually cared about a girl, especially if they showed interest in him, flirted with him constantly and he was returning the gestures.\u00a0Yet if that\u2019s what was going, what was his reason for it?</p><p>You decided it was time to ask and see what he had to say.</p>",

Three more to go.</p><p>You walked up the steps of the main building to get your first class, excited to see your friends from last year. With your books clutched to your chest, you wandered down the hall looking at each door to find the right room number.\u00a0Suddenly, you heard your name from one of the oncoming rooms and saw your friend Kim waving at you.\u00a0You smiled big and ran up to her, giving her a huge hug.</p><p>\u201cHey, [Y/N]! How was your summer?\u201d she asked you while the two of you walked in the class and sat down.<br></p><p>\u201cIt was good. Got to spend it with the family at our lake house. How was yours?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cBoring as usual. And aggravating because of my little brother.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cIs Sarah here?\u201d you asked her.<br></p><p>\u201cNo, not in this class. But she\u2019s in another one of our classes so we\u2019ll see her later.\u201d<br></p><p>You glanced around the rest of the room, seeing quite a few new faces. And one of those new faces definitely caught your eye.</p>[[MORE]]<p>He was sitting a couple rows behind you, quietly flipping through the text book. His brown tousled hair, as crazy as it sounds, looked just perfect. And those eyes were perfect as well. Everything about him seemed to be. You just knew that you would have to get to know him.</p><p>You immediately turned to Kim and slightly nudged your head in his direction, asking who he was. She looked back and shrugged.</p><p>\u201cNew guy, I guess. I\u2019m sure the teacher will go through the class and have each of us say our names so we can know who each other is.\u201d<br></p><p>And that\u2019s exactly what happened. 10 minutes later, the teacher walked in and had everyone announce their names.</p><p>\u201cTony Stark,\u201d the man said when his turn came. You immediately repeated the name over several times in your head before the teacher got to you. You almost said his name out loud when you stood up but quickly composed yourself before the embarrassment occurred.<br></p><p>\u201c[Y/N] [Y/L/N],\u201d you said out loud, sitting back down as quick as possible.<br></p><p>You glanced back at him and he noticed, giving you a small smile and wave. You smiled back and waved at him then turning around with your face feeling hot.</p><p>This was gonna be an interesting year for you.</p><hr><p>The next week you decided that you were gonna try and introduce yourself to Tony, after finally getting the courage to do it. So you walked into class right when the bell rang and sat in the seat next to him.\u00a0You looked over and smiled as you set your bag down and pulled out your textbook. He smiled back then focused on what the teacher started talking about.</p><p>When the\u00a0teacher\u2019s lecture was over and he assigned work for the class to do, you started working on it but was having a bit of trouble with a few of the problems. You figured this was the perfect time trying to talk to Tony and gently tapped his arm. He glanced over at you.</p><p>\u201cHey, Tony. I can\u2019t figure these out. You think you could help me?\u201d<br></p><p>He gave a small smile and scooted over a bit towards you.\u00a0\u201cSure, [Y/N].\u201d</p><p>The two of you worked on your papers together for the rest of the class, getting to know a little bit more of each other in the process. When the bell rang for class to be over, he handed you a small piece of paper.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my number. Call me if you have any more questions on the assignment. Or if you just wanna study. I\u2019m free most nights.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d you said, feeling your face get hot.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ll add it to my contacts list.\u201d<br></p><p>He nodded and started to turn to walk away but then you grabbed his wrist.\u00a0\u201cWait.\u201d</p><p>The two of you looked down at the situation and you immediately let go of his wrist, your entire body feeling flushed. You set your stuff down, ripped out a sheet of paper from your notebook and wrote down your number.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s mine,\u201d you stammered, looking down.\u00a0\u201cIf you wanna just hang out\u2026 maybe grab a coffee?\u201d<br></p><p>Smiling, Tony took it and stuck it in his pocket.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019d like that, [Y/N].\u201d</p><p>You slowly looked up to see him walking away. And you couldn\u2019t help but stare at every muscle in his body, your eyes wandering lower until they were completely glued to his ass. Snapping yourself our of the daze that you were in, you went to the rest of your classes like you were walking on the clouds.</p><p>That night you called him and talked on the phone for over two hours. The conversation first started on the assignment but the went into personal things and learning more about each other. You never felt so giddy in your life; like you were back in high school.\u00a0And so started the budding friendship between the two of you.</p><p>You\u2019d spend as much time with him in class as possible, along with spending a little bit of time outside of it. And as the school year continued, you started to develop feelings for Tony. After all, you guys seemed to be inseparable when you were together in and out of the classroom; especially when it was the two of you hanging out in the spot underneath the oak tree on campus. People just started assuming that you two were a couple because of how much you were together. Even more so because of the way you would sit with Tony while you two studied; his head in your lap, your back against his chest, the way you\u2019d play with his hair and run your fingers through it.</p><p>This flirting went on for months between the two of you. And you loved every moment of it. You were practically putty in his hands and you couldn\u2019t help it. There was just something about him that you knew you wanted, yet could never get the words out. \u00a0\u00a0</p><p>And even though it seemed like Tony may have had those same feelings, he never once asked you out. You thought it was a bit strange but didn\u2019t want to be pushy about it so you never really asked or brought up the situation. That was until you finally found out why.</p><p>You saw him holding hands with a girl, one you\u2019d never seen before,\u00a0walking to the library. They talked and smiled and laughed with each other; and then standing in front of the doors, he kissed her on the lips. Immediately you turned around, not wanting to have that feeling of your heart sinking to the floor but it was to late. You walked away, feeling your stomach turn into knots.</p><p>Was he just playing with you and your feelings towards him? Never once did you think that he was playing you.\u00a0You never took him to be that kind of person. You considered Tony to be one that actually cared about a girl, especially if they showed interest in him, flirted with him constantly and he was returning the gestures.\u00a0Yet if that\u2019s what was going, what was his reason for it?</p><p>You decided it was time to ask and see what he had to say.</p>",

His brown tousled hair, as crazy as it sounds, looked just perfect. And those eyes were perfect as well. Everything about him seemed to be. You just knew that you would have to get to know him.</p><p>You immediately turned to Kim and slightly nudged your head in his direction, asking who he was. She looked back and shrugged.</p><p>\u201cNew guy, I guess. I\u2019m sure the teacher will go through the class and have each of us say our names so we can know who each other is.\u201d<br></p><p>And that\u2019s exactly what happened. 10 minutes later, the teacher walked in and had everyone announce their names.</p><p>\u201cTony Stark,\u201d the man said when his turn came. You immediately repeated the name over several times in your head before the teacher got to you. You almost said his name out loud when you stood up but quickly composed yourself before the embarrassment occurred.<br></p><p>\u201c[Y/N] [Y/L/N],\u201d you said out loud, sitting back down as quick as possible.<br></p><p>You glanced back at him and he noticed, giving you a small smile and wave. You smiled back and waved at him then turning around with your face feeling hot.</p><p>This was gonna be an interesting year for you.</p><hr><p>The next week you decided that you were gonna try and introduce yourself to Tony, after finally getting the courage to do it. So you walked into class right when the bell rang and sat in the seat next to him.\u00a0You looked over and smiled as you set your bag down and pulled out your textbook. He smiled back then focused on what the teacher started talking about.</p><p>When the\u00a0teacher\u2019s lecture was over and he assigned work for the class to do, you started working on it but was having a bit of trouble with a few of the problems. You figured this was the perfect time trying to talk to Tony and gently tapped his arm. He glanced over at you.</p><p>\u201cHey, Tony. I can\u2019t figure these out. You think you could help me?\u201d<br></p><p>He gave a small smile and scooted over a bit towards you.\u00a0\u201cSure, [Y/N].\u201d</p><p>The two of you worked on your papers together for the rest of the class, getting to know a little bit more of each other in the process. When the bell rang for class to be over, he handed you a small piece of paper.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my number. Call me if you have any more questions on the assignment. Or if you just wanna study. I\u2019m free most nights.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d you said, feeling your face get hot.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ll add it to my contacts list.\u201d<br></p><p>He nodded and started to turn to walk away but then you grabbed his wrist.\u00a0\u201cWait.\u201d</p><p>The two of you looked down at the situation and you immediately let go of his wrist, your entire body feeling flushed. You set your stuff down, ripped out a sheet of paper from your notebook and wrote down your number.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s mine,\u201d you stammered, looking down.\u00a0\u201cIf you wanna just hang out\u2026 maybe grab a coffee?\u201d<br></p><p>Smiling, Tony took it and stuck it in his pocket.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019d like that, [Y/N].\u201d</p><p>You slowly looked up to see him walking away. And you couldn\u2019t help but stare at every muscle in his body, your eyes wandering lower until they were completely glued to his ass. Snapping yourself our of the daze that you were in, you went to the rest of your classes like you were walking on the clouds.</p><p>That night you called him and talked on the phone for over two hours. The conversation first started on the assignment but the went into personal things and learning more about each other. You never felt so giddy in your life; like you were back in high school.\u00a0And so started the budding friendship between the two of you.</p><p>You\u2019d spend as much time with him in class as possible, along with spending a little bit of time outside of it. And as the school year continued, you started to develop feelings for Tony. After all, you guys seemed to be inseparable when you were together in and out of the classroom; especially when it was the two of you hanging out in the spot underneath the oak tree on campus. People just started assuming that you two were a couple because of how much you were together. Even more so because of the way you would sit with Tony while you two studied; his head in your lap, your back against his chest, the way you\u2019d play with his hair and run your fingers through it.</p><p>This flirting went on for months between the two of you. And you loved every moment of it. You were practically putty in his hands and you couldn\u2019t help it. There was just something about him that you knew you wanted, yet could never get the words out. \u00a0\u00a0</p><p>And even though it seemed like Tony may have had those same feelings, he never once asked you out. You thought it was a bit strange but didn\u2019t want to be pushy about it so you never really asked or brought up the situation. That was until you finally found out why.</p><p>You saw him holding hands with a girl, one you\u2019d never seen before,\u00a0walking to the library. They talked and smiled and laughed with each other; and then standing in front of the doors, he kissed her on the lips. Immediately you turned around, not wanting to have that feeling of your heart sinking to the floor but it was to late. You walked away, feeling your stomach turn into knots.</p><p>Was he just playing with you and your feelings towards him? Never once did you think that he was playing you.\u00a0You never took him to be that kind of person. You considered Tony to be one that actually cared about a girl, especially if they showed interest in him, flirted with him constantly and he was returning the gestures.\u00a0Yet if that\u2019s what was going, what was his reason for it?</p><p>You decided it was time to ask and see what he had to say.</p>",

I&rsquo;m free most nights.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; you said, feeling your face get hot.&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll add it to my contacts list.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>He nodded and started to turn to walk away but then you grabbed his wrist.&nbsp;&ldquo;Wait.&rdquo;</p><p>The two of you looked down at the situation and you immediately let go of his wrist, your entire body feeling flushed. You set your stuff down, ripped out a sheet of paper from your notebook and wrote down your number.</p><p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s mine,&rdquo; you stammered, looking down.&nbsp;&ldquo;If you wanna just hang out&hellip; maybe grab a coffee?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Smiling, Tony took it and stuck it in his pocket.&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like that, [Y/N].&rdquo;</p><p>You slowly looked up to see him walking away. And you couldn&rsquo;t help but stare at every muscle in his body, your eyes wandering lower until they were completely glued to his ass. Snapping yourself our of the daze that you were in, you went to the rest of your classes like you were walking on the clouds.</p><p>That night you called him and talked on the phone for over two hours. The conversation first started on the assignment but the went into personal things and learning more about each other. You never felt so giddy in your life; like you were back in high school.&nbsp;And so started the budding friendship between the two of you.</p><p>You&rsquo;d spend as much time with him in class as possible, along with spending a little bit of time outside of it. And as the school year continued, you started to develop feelings for Tony. After all, you guys seemed to be inseparable when you were together in and out of the classroom; especially when it was the two of you hanging out in the spot underneath the oak tree on campus. People just started assuming that you two were a couple because of how much you were together. Even more so because of the way you would sit with Tony while you two studied; his head in your lap, your back against his chest, the way you&rsquo;d play with his hair and run your fingers through it.</p><p>This flirting went on for months between the two of you. And you loved every moment of it. You were practically putty in his hands and you couldn&rsquo;t help it. There was just something about him that you knew you wanted, yet could never get the words out. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>And even though it seemed like Tony may have had those same feelings, he never once asked you out. You thought it was a bit strange but didn&rsquo;t want to be pushy about it so you never really asked or brought up the situation. That was until you finally found out why.</p><p>You saw him holding hands with a girl, one you&rsquo;d never seen before,&nbsp;walking to the library. They talked and smiled and laughed with each other; and then standing in front of the doors, he kissed her on the lips. Immediately you turned around, not wanting to have that feeling of your heart sinking to the floor but it was to late. You walked away, feeling your stomach turn into knots.</p><p>Was he just playing with you and your feelings towards him? Never once did you think that he was playing you.&nbsp;You never took him to be that kind of person. You considered Tony to be one that actually cared about a girl, especially if they showed interest in him, flirted with him constantly and he was returning the gestures.&nbsp;Yet if that&rsquo;s what was going, what was his reason for it?</p><p>You decided it was time to ask and see what he had to say.</p>",
                "content_abstract": "<p>\n<p>[Summary]: You knew Tony in college for three years. And in those three years, you had such a crush on him. You&rsquo;re not really sure if he ever knew, even though there were times when it seemed like he did. And after graduating, you both went your separate ways but you still had those feelings for him. Years later, he reenters your life in the craziest way.

Three more to go.</p>\n<p>You walked up the steps of the main building to get your first class, excited to see your friends from last year. With your books clutched to your chest, you wandered down the hall looking at each door to find the right room number.&nbsp;Suddenly, you heard your name from one of the oncoming rooms and saw your friend Kim waving at you.&nbsp;You smiled big and ran up to her, giving her a huge hug.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Hey, [Y/N]! How was your summer?&rdquo; she asked you while the two of you walked in the class and sat down.<br /></p>\n<p>&ldquo;It was good. Got to spend it with the family at our lake house. How was yours?&rdquo;<br /></p>\n<p>&ldquo;Boring as usual. And aggravating because of my little brother.&rdquo;<br /></p>\n<p>&ldquo;Is Sarah here?&rdquo; you asked her.<br /></p>\n<p>&ldquo;No, not in this class.

But it didn\u2019t sound that way when it passed Steve\u2019s lips.</p><p>\u201cHey, honey.\u201d His smile was blinding as he turned to face Tony, holding up a box of cereal in a silent question. \u201cHaven\u2019t seen you around for a while.\u201d</p><p>Tony dropped down heavily onto a chair at the dining table and shook his head at Steve\u2019s offer. \u201cYeah, I\u2019ve been down in the lab or at SI. They\u2019re trying to push a new project, but we\u2019ve detected a bug. It\u2019s\u2026\u201d he trailed off and waved his hand. \u201cIt\u2019s exhausting.\u201d</p><p>Steve grimaced in sympathy and reached for a loaf of bread instead, throwing two slices into the toaster. \u201cIs it over now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think so.\u201d Tony\u2019s voice was slurred into his arms as he rested his head on the table. \u201cFor me, anyway. Pepper made me leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Tony hummed when a hand soothed over his hair, fingers scratching lightly at his scalp before Steve\u2019s soft voice spoke again. \u201cYou need some sleep, angel. You\u2019re exhausted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMm.\u201d His sleep-addled mind didn\u2019t even startle at that pet-name, merely leaning into the gentle touch like a kitten desperate for attention. \u201cCome with me?\u201d</p><p>There was a smile in his voice when Steve replied, his hand not stopping its motions once. \u201cAlways.\u201d</p><p>/</p><p>They were in a relationship before Tony really noticed what was happening. Steve\u2019s company was ever-present and Tony had come to rely on it more than he had ever thought he would. Things sort of just bloomed from an innocent movie night and a wink in Tony\u2019s direction. The pet names had definitely oiled the way as well\u2026</p><p>Damn, Steve was smooth as hell. </p><p>/</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s on your mind, darlin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>Tony nuzzled closer to Steve, pressing his cold nose into Steve\u2019s throat. \u201cWhat\u2019s with the names?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t like them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow hang on a moment,\u201d Tony murmured quickly, \u201cI never said that.\u201d</p><p>Steve pressed a kiss to the top of Tony\u2019s head. \u201cI don\u2019t know where they came from, really. You just bring \u2018em out.\u201d</p><p>There was a moment of quiet before Steve tightened his arms around Tony\u2019s body and sighed thoughtfully, eyes looking at the ceiling. \u201cBucky used to use them all the time with every gal on his arm, but I never did. They just never came naturally. Not until you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMm.\u201d</p><p>Steve\u2019s hand started drawing soft circles on Tony\u2019s back as his eyes slipped shut. \u201cYou got a favourite?\u201d</p><p>Tony thought for a moment before he shook his head slowly. \u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d better think of some more then hadn\u2019t I, baby? See if we can narrow it down.\u201d</p><p>A tiny shiver went down Tony\u2019s spine at that and his lips curved up into a smile. \u201cThat one\u2019s up there. Definitely up there.\u201d </p>",

Bagels and coffee first?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that even a question?\u201d</p><p>/</p><p>Tony had always thought \u2018honey\u2019 sounded sarcastic. Maybe it stemmed from his drunk father slurring it at Maria whenever she tried to get him to stand up or get dressed or pay attention to her and Tony. But it didn\u2019t sound that way when it passed Steve\u2019s lips.</p><p>\u201cHey, honey.\u201d His smile was blinding as he turned to face Tony, holding up a box of cereal in a silent question. \u201cHaven\u2019t seen you around for a while.\u201d</p><p>Tony dropped down heavily onto a chair at the dining table and shook his head at Steve\u2019s offer. \u201cYeah, I\u2019ve been down in the lab or at SI. They\u2019re trying to push a new project, but we\u2019ve detected a bug. It\u2019s\u2026\u201d he trailed off and waved his hand. \u201cIt\u2019s exhausting.\u201d</p><p>Steve grimaced in sympathy and reached for a loaf of bread instead, throwing two slices into the toaster. \u201cIs it over now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think so.\u201d Tony\u2019s voice was slurred into his arms as he rested his head on the table. \u201cFor me, anyway. Pepper made me leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Tony hummed when a hand soothed over his hair, fingers scratching lightly at his scalp before Steve\u2019s soft voice spoke again. \u201cYou need some sleep, angel. You\u2019re exhausted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMm.\u201d His sleep-addled mind didn\u2019t even startle at that pet-name, merely leaning into the gentle touch like a kitten desperate for attention. \u201cCome with me?\u201d</p><p>There was a smile in his voice when Steve replied, his hand not stopping its motions once. \u201cAlways.\u201d</p><p>/</p><p>They were in a relationship before Tony really noticed what was happening. Steve\u2019s company was ever-present and Tony had come to rely on it more than he had ever thought he would. Things sort of just bloomed from an innocent movie night and a wink in Tony\u2019s direction. The pet names had definitely oiled the way as well\u2026</p><p>Damn, Steve was smooth as hell. </p><p>/</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s on your mind, darlin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>Tony nuzzled closer to Steve, pressing his cold nose into Steve\u2019s throat. \u201cWhat\u2019s with the names?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t like them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow hang on a moment,\u201d Tony murmured quickly, \u201cI never said that.\u201d</p><p>Steve pressed a kiss to the top of Tony\u2019s head. \u201cI don\u2019t know where they came from, really. You just bring \u2018em out.\u201d</p><p>There was a moment of quiet before Steve tightened his arms around Tony\u2019s body and sighed thoughtfully, eyes looking at the ceiling. \u201cBucky used to use them all the time with every gal on his arm, but I never did. They just never came naturally. Not until you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMm.\u201d</p><p>Steve\u2019s hand started drawing soft circles on Tony\u2019s back as his eyes slipped shut. \u201cYou got a favourite?\u201d</p><p>Tony thought for a moment before he shook his head slowly. \u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d better think of some more then hadn\u2019t I, baby? See if we can narrow it down.\u201d</p><p>A tiny shiver went down Tony\u2019s spine at that and his lips curved up into a smile. \u201cThat one\u2019s up there. Definitely up there.\u201d </p>",
