        "body": "<h1>Startcrossed Lovers Pt. 2</h1><p>As he approached the truck he saw how peaceful and content you were. </p><p>&ldquo;So, this is what you do on your free time?&rdquo; He noted, making you realize someone was coming. Knowing clearly who it was you, smiled widely. </p><p>&ldquo;Most girls, party or stay in I suppose, but then again, I&rsquo;m not most girls. What are you doing here anyway? Shouldn&rsquo;t you be in bed sleeping or out on a pub??&rdquo; </p><p>He simply replied, &ldquo;C'mon, I only go out when it&rsquo;s with you, I don&rsquo;t know Arizona, remember? Plus, I wouldn&rsquo;t miss this for the world. When else will I get a chance to look at a shooting star and make my wish?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Fair point, how&rsquo;d you find me anyway? Stalker.&rdquo; You teased. </p><p>&ldquo;I remembered this is one of your favorite places, I was gonna call you to ask but I sort of wanted this to be a surprise.&rdquo; </p><p>Eagerly you told him, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m surprised, now friend. What did you bring me!?&rdquo;</p><p>He laughed at her excitement, this was her. This was the girl that occupied his mind and heart on a daily basis. The one he was sure he was in love with because he had never had such strong feelings for a person. The one who, when he saw would make his palms sweaty and his stomach twirl. Many times he had imagined what it would be like to be with you. To call you his, and everytime reality hit him like a cold slap in the face. He lived over 5,000 miles away, there was one ocean between your worlds. Yet, you were so passionate and loving, kind and sweet. You made his days better&hellip; if only you knew. </p><p>Out of his daydream he smiled and stated, &ldquo;I brought coffee and donuts, I didn&rsquo;t forget your gift but I will give it to you tomorrow. I know if I give it to you today I won&rsquo;t get time with you tomorrow so you&rsquo;re gonna have to wait.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Fine, just get in here loser. The stars don&rsquo;t wait on anyone.&rdquo; </p><p>As he jumped on the bed of the truck he took a seat next to you and provided you with the goodies he brought. You had to admit, this was surprising. Star gazing was always something you did on your own. For many reasons, but the main one being that you hated having to explain the constellations and stars, you hated having the peace disrupted when these were your happy moments. You were not disturbed by Tom&rsquo;s presence though.

The building was in shambles, and she had no clue why. </p><p>She always saw a boy in her dreams, wearing a blue and red suit with a giant spider in the center of it. Y/N never saw the boys face, and never heard his voice but she knew that they were connected somehow.</p><p>In the Red Room the talk of soulmates was frowned upon, and if you were caught talking about it you would be punished. Y/N never spoke of her dreams to anyone. She wondered if it were true, she wondered if soulmates were a real thing in the world. </p><p>She always hoped that when she had graduated and left the Red Room, she would meet this mystery person who clouded her dreams, but she also hoped she wouldn\u2019t. She was made into a monster, and she wasn\u2019t even sure if anyone would ever want her.

Peter was very proud of what he had become, how much he had overcome and faced. </p><p>Even with being a masked hero he was still a teenage boy who was going to school and waiting for his soulmate. His Aunt May would always tell him her story about how she met his Uncle, how it was basically love at first sight. Of course Peter thought that was over doing it a bit, but how would he know? He hadn&rsquo;t met his soulmate yet. </p><p>A lot of kids at Midtown High had already met their soulmates, there were some that hadn&rsquo;t but it seemed like everyone was meeting theirs sooner than Peter ever would. </p><p>For a long time Peter thought he didn&rsquo;t have a soulmate, he thought the universe just didn&rsquo;t want him to find his other half. That was until he started having the same dream every night. </p><p>The first night he just thought it was a dream, a normal dream like the rest of them. And then the nights went on and he kept having the same dream. Peter waited a week to tell Aunt May, too scared to hear what she would say. He knew there were different soulmate attachments. Some people had tattoos of their significant others favorite thing, some had the first words of their significant other tattooed to their arms. There were so many different possibilities, but Peter didn&rsquo;t know if his was a soulmate attachment or not.</p><p>When Peter told his aunt he thought she&rsquo;d tell him it was just a dream, but she didn&rsquo;t. She didn&rsquo;t tell him that. </p><p>&ldquo;Peter, your &lsquo;dreams&rsquo; aren&rsquo;t dreams at all.&rdquo; May had no idea how she would explain this to Peter, he already looked confused and scared as it was. May sighed, &ldquo;Peter you and you&rsquo;re soulmate are connected through this dream, but it&rsquo;s really showing you two when you are going to meet. You&rsquo;re basically seeing the future.&rdquo; May said. </p><p>At first Peter didn&rsquo;t believe her, but again as the nights went on and the dream was the only thing he saw in his sleep, he became to believe the words his aunt had told him. </p><p>Peter never knew where his dream took place, he never knew when it took place, but all he knew was this. There was screaming, so much screaming, gunshots, a building that was falling apart in some areas, and a girl. A girl that was curled up in a corner. He never heard her voice when her mouth moved, he never got her name through the dream, but he could see her face. He knew what his soulmate looked like and all he wanted now was to find her. </p><p>Peter&rsquo;s only worry was did she know who he was? Did she know him, his alter ego, or both? Who did she see in her dreams?<br /></p></p>",

She wondered if it were true, she wondered if soulmates were a real thing in the world. </p>\n<p>She always hoped that when she had graduated and left the Red Room, she would meet this mystery person who clouded her dreams, but she also hoped she wouldn&rsquo;t. She was made into a monster, and she wasn&rsquo;t even sure if anyone would ever want her. Even her soulmate.</p>\n<p>The dreams seemed to be happening every night, until the night everything changed for her, when she was more scared for her life than ever.</p>\n</p>",
