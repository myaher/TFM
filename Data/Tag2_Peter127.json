You shifted your glance back at the words of the screen and they turned into a blur. You sighed, knowing that your body wasn\u2019t going to let you study anymore. It demanded rest.</p><p>You closed your laptop then turned off the lamp sitting beside it. You peeled yourself slowly out of your chair and crawled onto your bed before sliding under the sheets. You closed your eyes and it was the best feeling in the world.</p><p>Your phone, that was still sitting on the desk, vibrated, alerting you that you received a text. Without even hesitating, you rolled onto your side and happily ignored it. Pulling the sheets up and tighter around you, you revelled in the fact that you were finally falling asleep.</p><!-- more --><p><i>Your phone vibrated in your hand and you lifted it up to read it. It was a text from Peter, wondering where you were. You quickly texted him back saying that you were almost there. The train pulled to a stop and pushed your way off the carriage before sprinting towards school. </i></p><p><i>The run took longer than you recognised it, turning every corner almost twice in a row. But you finally reached the school, bursting in through the front doors. You arrived at your classroom and once you entered, every student at their desk lifted their heads and stared at you. </i></p><p><i> \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re late, Y/N,\u201d your teacher said firmly. \u201cWait outside until the test is over.\u201d</i></p><p><i> \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhat? I can\u2019t even take the test? I\u2019ll stay behind,\u201d you pleaded. There was a distant tapping sound that you heard but chose to ignore. \u00a0</i></p><p><i>Your teacher shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, that\u2019s the rules. Go outside and stop disturbing the other students.\u201d Tap. Tap. Tap. </i></p><p><i>Your teacher walked towards you, guiding you out the door. \u201cOut you go, come on.\u201d </i></p><p><i>Tap. Tap. Tap.</i></p><p>When you finally acknowledged the incessant noise, you woke up. The tapping was louder now, sounding like it was coming from behind you. You reached out and turned the lamp on. You rolled onto your opposite side and gasped when you saw Spiderman staring at you through the window. His face was pinned to the glass like some creep in a horror movie who liked to watch you sleep. While Peter wasn\u2019t a creepy kid, he certainly was an odd one, but that\u2019s what you liked most about him anyway.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cJesus, Peter,\u201d you hissed, reaching out and opening your window.</p><p>Peter sticks his head under the window. \u201cGreetings, earthling.\u201d</p><p>He pulls himself through, closing the window behind him. You sit up in bed, rubbing your tired eyes. Peter sits on the end of your bed and crosses his legs, pulling off his mask. His brown curls practically bounced up once the mask came off before it flopped down across his forehead.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d you whispered. \u201cAnd why are dressed as Spiderman?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOh, I saved a cat from a tree, no big deal. But I came because I had to ask you something.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIt can\u2019t wait till the morning, you weirdo?\u201d</p><p>Peter suddenly smiled and you couldn\u2019t help but smile as well. It was infectious. His smile was something you always marvelled at. It was difficult to hide your feelings for Peter considering you weren\u2019t sure whether or not he liked you back. Peter\u2019s an awkward kid, you never understood anything he said or did half the time anyway.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhat are you smiling about it?\u201d you asked.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWill you go to prom with me?\u201d</p><p>You froze, trying to register what he just said. You definitely weren\u2019t expecting it. Prom wasn\u2019t for a few more weeks, but that wasn\u2019t the part that struck you. You couldn\u2019t imagine Peter would ask you to prom. Considering what happened at homecoming, you didn\u2019t even think Peter would want to go.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s smile fell. \u201cProm? You forgot, didn\u2019t you? Oh, you\u2019re going with someone else. It\u2019s Flash, isn\u2019t it? Isn\u2019t it? Oh god, I knew I shouldn\u2019t\u2019ve said-\u201d</p><p>You reached out and covered Peter\u2019s mouth to stop him from talking. Instantly his cheeks heated up, turning red.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI will go to prom with you, Peter, just calm down,\u201d you said, laughing.</p><p>Peter\u2019s smile returned. He actually looked relieved. \u201cCool. Uh, the theme is Under the Stars, if you forgot.\u201d</p><p>You shook your head. \u201cI didn\u2019t forget. I\u2019ll wear something shiny.\u201d</p><p>Peter chuckled. \u201cCool, so\u2026 it\u2019s a date.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s a date.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cSee you then\u2026then.\u201d Peter reached out and ruffled your hair before he crawled back out the window. You laughed awkwardly, slowly smoothing your hair back down. You couldn\u2019t wipe the smile off your face.</p><p>You turned the lamp back off and slid back under the covers. This time you couldn\u2019t fall asleep.</p><hr><p>After Peter climbed up the fire escape and reached the roof of your apartment building, he remembered the interaction he just had with you.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI just ruffled her hair,\u201d he said to himself. \u201cIs she a dog? What were you thinking?\u201d</p><p>He paced up and down the roof, going through his head everything that had happened until he suddenly halted.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cShe said yes. Karen, did you hear that?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI did, Peter,\u201d replied Karen, Spiderman\u2019s user interface. \u201cCongratulations.\u201d</p><p>Peter grinned harder, jumping up and down. Ever since they started selling tickets for prom, Peter was hesitant. He wondered who you\u2019d go with, not even considering himself as a potential partner. You were always the confident, bubbly person who got along with everyone. He expected everyone to be lining up to be your date. Peter assumed he had left it too late until Ned told him that afternoon that no one had asked you yet.</p><p>Peter had spent all day bucking up the courage to ask you, that\u2019s why at 2:30 in the morning he came knocking on your window. And how relieved he was when you said yes.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThis is your chance to ask her to be your girlfriend,\u201d Karen said.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI-I-I don\u2019t know\u2026\u201d Peter sat down on the roof, dangling his feet over the edge.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou obviously like her, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYeah,\u201d Peter replied. \u201cI like her a lot. But we\u2019ve been friends for so long. What if I screw things up?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou won\u2019t know unless you try.\u201d</p><p>Peter nodded, knowing Karen was right. Peter\u2019s never been afraid of taking chances; he was a known risk-taker. But this was different. He cared for you so much and valued your friendship more than anything and if he lost that, he\u2019d be heart-broken.</p><p>If only he knew\u2026</p><hr><p>A few weeks later, the day had finally arrived. Peter dressed himself in a rented tux that May said made him look like a movie star. He put gel in his curls to hold them down, knowing how unreliable and messy they became sometimes.</p><p>He adjusted his bow tie in the mirror, making sure it was straight. Peter realised how much unnecessary pressure he was putting on himself, hoping that this night would go perfectly. He was especially nervous about the fact that he was going to confess his feelings. He planned to save it for the end of the night as to not ruin the evening if you didn\u2019t feel the same way.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou look so handsome, Peter,\u201d May said, leaning on the door frame. She picked up the silver and white corsage on his desk and passed it to him. \u201cIf she doesn\u2019t fall in love with you tonight, I\u2019d assume she\u2019s got something wrong with her.\u201d</p><p>Peter smiled. \u201cThanks, Aunt May. I\u2019ll see you when I get home.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cTwelve o\u2019clock. Don\u2019t forget.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>With that, Peter kissed May on the cheek then headed out the door.</p><p>Peter clenched his trembling hand and knocked on the door. He took a deep breath and waited, bouncing on his tip toes. The door opened and Peter quickly looked up. Standing before him in a floor-length silver dress, you greeted Peter with a smile. Peter lost his breath at the sight of you.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWow,\u201d he whispered, his lips forming a big grin. \u201cYou-you look amazing.\u201d</p><p>You laughed nervously, running your hand down the side of your dress. \u201cReally? I think I look a little bit strange. Not myself.\u201d</p><p>Peter shook his head, his smile never faltering. \u201cYou look\u2026 really pretty. I mean, you always look pretty but-\u201d</p><p>You laughed, reaching out the take Peter\u2019s hand and squeezing it. \u201cThank you, Peter.\u201d You pulled him inside. \u201cYou look great too.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cUm, here.\u201d Peter took the corsage out of it\u2019s case and slid it onto your wrist.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThank you. I love it,\u201d you said, holding your arm out in front of you and admiring the flowers.</p><p>Your father dropped the pair of you off at school and Peter helped you out of the car. Prom was a lot different from homecoming a few years ago. It was the worst night of Peter\u2019s life, a night he\u2019d never forget. Peter wouldn\u2019t forget this night either, hopefully for different reasons, but so far, so good.</p><p>You linked your arm in Peter\u2019s and the two of you walked inside. Silver and white balloons studded the roof of the gymnasium with white lights shaped as stars floating around the room. A disco ball hung in the middle, reflecting light all around. Music played loudly in the background with students already dancing.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cPeter! Y/N!\u201d Ned called. Him, Betty and MJ were sitting in the bleachers.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHey guys,\u201d Peter said once the pair of you approached them. Betty and Ned were holding each other\u2019s hands, sitting closely next to one another. Peter imagined you and him sitting like that and he couldn\u2019t help but feel a surge of energy.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou all look amazing,\u201d you said.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cSo do you,\u201d Betty replied cheerfully. \u201cYou and Peter look like movie stars.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cFlash told us he\u2019s gonna try and spike the punch tonight so watch out,\u201d MJ said, nodding her head towards the food and drinks table. The group looked over and saw Flash slowly pacing around the table, making sure no one was looking. He spotted the group staring at him and he waved his hand, frowning, signalling them to look away.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOh man, he\u2019s gonna get kicked out,\u201d you laughed.</p><p>A new song from the DJ started to play and Betty shot up, grabbing yours and MJ\u2019s hands.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI love this song, come on!\u201d</p><p>She pulled the pair of you onto the dance floor and Peter and Ned followed. In a circle, the five of you started to dance. Jumping up and down, singing and laughing, you were all starting to have the best night of your high school lives. It seemed to hit you all at the same time that when this year ends, you won\u2019t be seeing each other every day. Peter found this to be the most difficult to handle, feeling more and more pressure against what he wanted to confess to you tonight.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI love you guys!\u201d Ned said, pulling you all into a group hug.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWe love you too!\u201d</p><p>Later, Peter and Ned left to get a drink. The pair of them stood by the food table and watched the rest of the students dancing and having a good time. Flash was unsuccessful in his attempts to spike the punch however he was allowed to stay. Peter saw him dancing closer to the DJ and often putting in song requests.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cSo, are you gonna tell her tonight?\u201d Ned asked.</p><p>Peter laughed nervously. \u201cI was planning on it, but I don\u2019t know. Y/N looks like she\u2019s having a lot of fun.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou\u2019ve got to do it, Peter.\u201d Ned placed his hand on Peter\u2019s shoulder. \u201cShe likes you.\u201d</p><p>Peter looked at Ned, wide-eyed. \u201cShe does? Did she tell you that?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cNo, but I can tell. Haven\u2019t you noticed the way she looks at you? She was giving you that look the whole night.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhat look? I haven\u2019t seen any look.\u201d Peter looked at you, still dancing with Betty and MJ. You looked happy, singing along with the girls. Peter was always so taken with how beautiful and amazing you were but tonight, he felt like he was falling in love.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThe look of love, Peter. The look of love.\u201d Ned put his cup on the table. \u201cNow, I hear a slow song is coming up so I\u2019m going to dance with my girlfriend.\u201d</p><p>Peter took a deep breath and finished off his drink. He shook his hands, trying to shake the nerves out. He watched as Ned pulled Betty away, then as MJ was pulled away with her date. You were left standing alone on the dance floor. Peter saw your eyes searching for his through the crowd. He approached you and you finally met his eyes. The slow song started. It was <i>Fade Into You</i> by Mazzy Star.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cDo you wanna dance?\u201d</p><p>You smiled. \u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>Peter placed his hands on your hips while you snaked your arms around his neck. The pair of you softly swayed to the music, feeling awkward all of a sudden.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI love this song,\u201d you said, filling the silence between you.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cMe too.\u201d</p><p>You looked away from Peter, watching all the other couples. They all looked at their partners like they were the only humans on earth. They looked comfortable with one another.</p><p>As you looked away, Peter stared at you. He got the feeling you weren\u2019t interested in him at all. But he wasn\u2019t going to back out now.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cY/N,\u201d he said quietly.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHmm?\u201d</p><p>You looked into his eyes and Peter felt butterflies. He studied your face for a moment, forgetting what he was going to say. He noticed your make up, light glittery pink eyeshadow decorated your eyes and shiny highlighter defined your cheekbones. Peter\u2019s seen you without make-up before and thought you looked beautiful either way. But right now, he was enraptured, lost in your eyes.</p><p>You let out a small laugh. \u201cAre you okay, Peter? You\u2019ve been acting strange all night.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m just nervous,\u201d he replied.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cNervous about what?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI like you, Y/N.\u201d</p><p>The smile of your face was one of happiness and relief. \u201cI like you too, Peter.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou-you do?\u201d</p><p>Peter felt your hand move to his cheek before you pressed your lips to his. He was surprised but he didn\u2019t break away. He wrapped his arms around you, pulling you closer.</p><p>After a few seconds, you pulled away but kept your face closely to his. You smiled, the heat rising in your cheeks as you looked at Peter. You never imagined you\u2019d be here, in Peter\u2019s arms and kissing his lips. The feeling made you laugh.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cWhat?\u201d Peter asked, laughing with you.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m just happy.\u201d You leaned your head on Peter\u2019s chest, closing your eyes as the pair of you continued to sway.</p><p>Peter rested his cheek on your head, his grin never faltering. This night, this song, this girl in his arms, he was never going to forget; he wouldn\u2019t let himself.</p><hr><p>taglist: <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mhyPBbIblxeqerGJEFSKQow\" target=\"_blank\">@bravest-at-heart</a> | <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/md9-kNdcfzVno1sOaFWpU5Q\" target=\"_blank\">@petersshirts</a> | <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_eNGNK44IX0-h-Fqi9rIdw\" target=\"_blank\">@peterstrainingwheels</a></p>",

It was a text from Peter, wondering where you were. You quickly texted him back saying that you were almost there. The train pulled to a stop and pushed your way off the carriage before sprinting towards school. </i></p><p><i>The run took longer than you recognised it, turning every corner almost twice in a row. But you finally reached the school, bursting in through the front doors. You arrived at your classroom and once you entered, every student at their desk lifted their heads and stared at you. </i></p><p><i> \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re late, Y/N,\u201d your teacher said firmly. \u201cWait outside until the test is over.\u201d</i></p><p><i> \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhat? I can\u2019t even take the test? I\u2019ll stay behind,\u201d you pleaded. There was a distant tapping sound that you heard but chose to ignore. \u00a0</i></p><p><i>Your teacher shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, that\u2019s the rules. Go outside and stop disturbing the other students.\u201d Tap. Tap. Tap. </i></p><p><i>Your teacher walked towards you, guiding you out the door. \u201cOut you go, come on.\u201d </i></p><p><i>Tap. Tap. Tap.</i></p><p>When you finally acknowledged the incessant noise, you woke up. The tapping was louder now, sounding like it was coming from behind you. You reached out and turned the lamp on. You rolled onto your opposite side and gasped when you saw Spiderman staring at you through the window. His face was pinned to the glass like some creep in a horror movie who liked to watch you sleep. While Peter wasn\u2019t a creepy kid, he certainly was an odd one, but that\u2019s what you liked most about him anyway.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cJesus, Peter,\u201d you hissed, reaching out and opening your window.</p><p>Peter sticks his head under the window. \u201cGreetings, earthling.\u201d</p><p>He pulls himself through, closing the window behind him. You sit up in bed, rubbing your tired eyes. Peter sits on the end of your bed and crosses his legs, pulling off his mask. His brown curls practically bounced up once the mask came off before it flopped down across his forehead.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d you whispered. \u201cAnd why are dressed as Spiderman?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOh, I saved a cat from a tree, no big deal. But I came because I had to ask you something.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIt can\u2019t wait till the morning, you weirdo?\u201d</p><p>Peter suddenly smiled and you couldn\u2019t help but smile as well. It was infectious. His smile was something you always marvelled at. It was difficult to hide your feelings for Peter considering you weren\u2019t sure whether or not he liked you back. Peter\u2019s an awkward kid, you never understood anything he said or did half the time anyway.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhat are you smiling about it?\u201d you asked.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWill you go to prom with me?\u201d</p><p>You froze, trying to register what he just said. You definitely weren\u2019t expecting it. Prom wasn\u2019t for a few more weeks, but that wasn\u2019t the part that struck you. You couldn\u2019t imagine Peter would ask you to prom. Considering what happened at homecoming, you didn\u2019t even think Peter would want to go.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s smile fell. \u201cProm? You forgot, didn\u2019t you? Oh, you\u2019re going with someone else. It\u2019s Flash, isn\u2019t it? Isn\u2019t it? Oh god, I knew I shouldn\u2019t\u2019ve said-\u201d</p><p>You reached out and covered Peter\u2019s mouth to stop him from talking. Instantly his cheeks heated up, turning red.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI will go to prom with you, Peter, just calm down,\u201d you said, laughing.</p><p>Peter\u2019s smile returned. He actually looked relieved. \u201cCool. Uh, the theme is Under the Stars, if you forgot.\u201d</p><p>You shook your head. \u201cI didn\u2019t forget. I\u2019ll wear something shiny.\u201d</p><p>Peter chuckled. \u201cCool, so\u2026 it\u2019s a date.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s a date.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cSee you then\u2026then.\u201d Peter reached out and ruffled your hair before he crawled back out the window. You laughed awkwardly, slowly smoothing your hair back down. You couldn\u2019t wipe the smile off your face.</p><p>You turned the lamp back off and slid back under the covers. This time you couldn\u2019t fall asleep.</p><hr><p>After Peter climbed up the fire escape and reached the roof of your apartment building, he remembered the interaction he just had with you.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI just ruffled her hair,\u201d he said to himself. \u201cIs she a dog? What were you thinking?\u201d</p><p>He paced up and down the roof, going through his head everything that had happened until he suddenly halted.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cShe said yes. Karen, did you hear that?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI did, Peter,\u201d replied Karen, Spiderman\u2019s user interface. \u201cCongratulations.\u201d</p><p>Peter grinned harder, jumping up and down. Ever since they started selling tickets for prom, Peter was hesitant. He wondered who you\u2019d go with, not even considering himself as a potential partner. You were always the confident, bubbly person who got along with everyone. He expected everyone to be lining up to be your date. Peter assumed he had left it too late until Ned told him that afternoon that no one had asked you yet.</p><p>Peter had spent all day bucking up the courage to ask you, that\u2019s why at 2:30 in the morning he came knocking on your window. And how relieved he was when you said yes.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThis is your chance to ask her to be your girlfriend,\u201d Karen said.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI-I-I don\u2019t know\u2026\u201d Peter sat down on the roof, dangling his feet over the edge.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou obviously like her, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYeah,\u201d Peter replied. \u201cI like her a lot. But we\u2019ve been friends for so long. What if I screw things up?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou won\u2019t know unless you try.\u201d</p><p>Peter nodded, knowing Karen was right. Peter\u2019s never been afraid of taking chances; he was a known risk-taker. But this was different. He cared for you so much and valued your friendship more than anything and if he lost that, he\u2019d be heart-broken.</p><p>If only he knew\u2026</p><hr><p>A few weeks later, the day had finally arrived. Peter dressed himself in a rented tux that May said made him look like a movie star. He put gel in his curls to hold them down, knowing how unreliable and messy they became sometimes.</p><p>He adjusted his bow tie in the mirror, making sure it was straight. Peter realised how much unnecessary pressure he was putting on himself, hoping that this night would go perfectly. He was especially nervous about the fact that he was going to confess his feelings. He planned to save it for the end of the night as to not ruin the evening if you didn\u2019t feel the same way.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou look so handsome, Peter,\u201d May said, leaning on the door frame. She picked up the silver and white corsage on his desk and passed it to him. \u201cIf she doesn\u2019t fall in love with you tonight, I\u2019d assume she\u2019s got something wrong with her.\u201d</p><p>Peter smiled. \u201cThanks, Aunt May. I\u2019ll see you when I get home.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cTwelve o\u2019clock. Don\u2019t forget.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>With that, Peter kissed May on the cheek then headed out the door.</p><p>Peter clenched his trembling hand and knocked on the door. He took a deep breath and waited, bouncing on his tip toes. The door opened and Peter quickly looked up. Standing before him in a floor-length silver dress, you greeted Peter with a smile. Peter lost his breath at the sight of you.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWow,\u201d he whispered, his lips forming a big grin. \u201cYou-you look amazing.\u201d</p><p>You laughed nervously, running your hand down the side of your dress. \u201cReally? I think I look a little bit strange. Not myself.\u201d</p><p>Peter shook his head, his smile never faltering. \u201cYou look\u2026 really pretty. I mean, you always look pretty but-\u201d</p><p>You laughed, reaching out the take Peter\u2019s hand and squeezing it. \u201cThank you, Peter.\u201d You pulled him inside. \u201cYou look great too.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cUm, here.\u201d Peter took the corsage out of it\u2019s case and slid it onto your wrist.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThank you. I love it,\u201d you said, holding your arm out in front of you and admiring the flowers.</p><p>Your father dropped the pair of you off at school and Peter helped you out of the car. Prom was a lot different from homecoming a few years ago. It was the worst night of Peter\u2019s life, a night he\u2019d never forget. Peter wouldn\u2019t forget this night either, hopefully for different reasons, but so far, so good.</p><p>You linked your arm in Peter\u2019s and the two of you walked inside. Silver and white balloons studded the roof of the gymnasium with white lights shaped as stars floating around the room. A disco ball hung in the middle, reflecting light all around. Music played loudly in the background with students already dancing.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cPeter! Y/N!\u201d Ned called. Him, Betty and MJ were sitting in the bleachers.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHey guys,\u201d Peter said once the pair of you approached them. Betty and Ned were holding each other\u2019s hands, sitting closely next to one another. Peter imagined you and him sitting like that and he couldn\u2019t help but feel a surge of energy.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou all look amazing,\u201d you said.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cSo do you,\u201d Betty replied cheerfully. \u201cYou and Peter look like movie stars.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cFlash told us he\u2019s gonna try and spike the punch tonight so watch out,\u201d MJ said, nodding her head towards the food and drinks table. The group looked over and saw Flash slowly pacing around the table, making sure no one was looking. He spotted the group staring at him and he waved his hand, frowning, signalling them to look away.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOh man, he\u2019s gonna get kicked out,\u201d you laughed.</p><p>A new song from the DJ started to play and Betty shot up, grabbing yours and MJ\u2019s hands.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI love this song, come on!\u201d</p><p>She pulled the pair of you onto the dance floor and Peter and Ned followed. In a circle, the five of you started to dance. Jumping up and down, singing and laughing, you were all starting to have the best night of your high school lives. It seemed to hit you all at the same time that when this year ends, you won\u2019t be seeing each other every day. Peter found this to be the most difficult to handle, feeling more and more pressure against what he wanted to confess to you tonight.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI love you guys!\u201d Ned said, pulling you all into a group hug.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWe love you too!\u201d</p><p>Later, Peter and Ned left to get a drink. The pair of them stood by the food table and watched the rest of the students dancing and having a good time. Flash was unsuccessful in his attempts to spike the punch however he was allowed to stay. Peter saw him dancing closer to the DJ and often putting in song requests.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cSo, are you gonna tell her tonight?\u201d Ned asked.</p><p>Peter laughed nervously. \u201cI was planning on it, but I don\u2019t know. Y/N looks like she\u2019s having a lot of fun.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou\u2019ve got to do it, Peter.\u201d Ned placed his hand on Peter\u2019s shoulder. \u201cShe likes you.\u201d</p><p>Peter looked at Ned, wide-eyed. \u201cShe does? Did she tell you that?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cNo, but I can tell. Haven\u2019t you noticed the way she looks at you? She was giving you that look the whole night.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhat look? I haven\u2019t seen any look.\u201d Peter looked at you, still dancing with Betty and MJ. You looked happy, singing along with the girls. Peter was always so taken with how beautiful and amazing you were but tonight, he felt like he was falling in love.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThe look of love, Peter. The look of love.\u201d Ned put his cup on the table. \u201cNow, I hear a slow song is coming up so I\u2019m going to dance with my girlfriend.\u201d</p><p>Peter took a deep breath and finished off his drink. He shook his hands, trying to shake the nerves out. He watched as Ned pulled Betty away, then as MJ was pulled away with her date. You were left standing alone on the dance floor. Peter saw your eyes searching for his through the crowd. He approached you and you finally met his eyes. The slow song started. It was <i>Fade Into You</i> by Mazzy Star.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cDo you wanna dance?\u201d</p><p>You smiled. \u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>Peter placed his hands on your hips while you snaked your arms around his neck. The pair of you softly swayed to the music, feeling awkward all of a sudden.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI love this song,\u201d you said, filling the silence between you.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cMe too.\u201d</p><p>You looked away from Peter, watching all the other couples. They all looked at their partners like they were the only humans on earth. They looked comfortable with one another.</p><p>As you looked away, Peter stared at you. He got the feeling you weren\u2019t interested in him at all. But he wasn\u2019t going to back out now.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cY/N,\u201d he said quietly.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHmm?\u201d</p><p>You looked into his eyes and Peter felt butterflies. He studied your face for a moment, forgetting what he was going to say. He noticed your make up, light glittery pink eyeshadow decorated your eyes and shiny highlighter defined your cheekbones. Peter\u2019s seen you without make-up before and thought you looked beautiful either way. But right now, he was enraptured, lost in your eyes.</p><p>You let out a small laugh. \u201cAre you okay, Peter? You\u2019ve been acting strange all night.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m just nervous,\u201d he replied.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cNervous about what?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI like you, Y/N.\u201d</p><p>The smile of your face was one of happiness and relief. \u201cI like you too, Peter.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou-you do?\u201d</p><p>Peter felt your hand move to his cheek before you pressed your lips to his. He was surprised but he didn\u2019t break away. He wrapped his arms around you, pulling you closer.</p><p>After a few seconds, you pulled away but kept your face closely to his. You smiled, the heat rising in your cheeks as you looked at Peter. You never imagined you\u2019d be here, in Peter\u2019s arms and kissing his lips. The feeling made you laugh.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cWhat?\u201d Peter asked, laughing with you.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m just happy.\u201d You leaned your head on Peter\u2019s chest, closing your eyes as the pair of you continued to sway.</p><p>Peter rested his cheek on your head, his grin never faltering. This night, this song, this girl in his arms, he was never going to forget; he wouldn\u2019t let himself.</p><hr><p>taglist: <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mhyPBbIblxeqerGJEFSKQow\" target=\"_blank\">@bravest-at-heart</a> | <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/md9-kNdcfzVno1sOaFWpU5Q\" target=\"_blank\">@petersshirts</a> | <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_eNGNK44IX0-h-Fqi9rIdw\" target=\"_blank\">@peterstrainingwheels</a></p></p>",

Tap. Tap.</i></p><p>When you finally acknowledged the incessant noise, you woke up. The tapping was louder now, sounding like it was coming from behind you. You reached out and turned the lamp on. You rolled onto your opposite side and gasped when you saw Spiderman staring at you through the window. His face was pinned to the glass like some creep in a horror movie who liked to watch you sleep. While Peter wasn\u2019t a creepy kid, he certainly was an odd one, but that\u2019s what you liked most about him anyway.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cJesus, Peter,\u201d you hissed, reaching out and opening your window.</p><p>Peter sticks his head under the window. \u201cGreetings, earthling.\u201d</p><p>He pulls himself through, closing the window behind him. You sit up in bed, rubbing your tired eyes. Peter sits on the end of your bed and crosses his legs, pulling off his mask. His brown curls practically bounced up once the mask came off before it flopped down across his forehead.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d you whispered. \u201cAnd why are dressed as Spiderman?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOh, I saved a cat from a tree, no big deal. But I came because I had to ask you something.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIt can\u2019t wait till the morning, you weirdo?\u201d</p><p>Peter suddenly smiled and you couldn\u2019t help but smile as well. It was infectious. His smile was something you always marvelled at. It was difficult to hide your feelings for Peter considering you weren\u2019t sure whether or not he liked you back. Peter\u2019s an awkward kid, you never understood anything he said or did half the time anyway.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhat are you smiling about it?\u201d you asked.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWill you go to prom with me?\u201d</p><p>You froze, trying to register what he just said. You definitely weren\u2019t expecting it. Prom wasn\u2019t for a few more weeks, but that wasn\u2019t the part that struck you. You couldn\u2019t imagine Peter would ask you to prom. Considering what happened at homecoming, you didn\u2019t even think Peter would want to go.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s smile fell. \u201cProm? You forgot, didn\u2019t you? Oh, you\u2019re going with someone else. It\u2019s Flash, isn\u2019t it? Isn\u2019t it? Oh god, I knew I shouldn\u2019t\u2019ve said-\u201d</p><p>You reached out and covered Peter\u2019s mouth to stop him from talking. Instantly his cheeks heated up, turning red.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI will go to prom with you, Peter, just calm down,\u201d you said, laughing.</p><p>Peter\u2019s smile returned. He actually looked relieved. \u201cCool. Uh, the theme is Under the Stars, if you forgot.\u201d</p><p>You shook your head. \u201cI didn\u2019t forget. I\u2019ll wear something shiny.\u201d</p><p>Peter chuckled. \u201cCool, so\u2026 it\u2019s a date.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s a date.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cSee you then\u2026then.\u201d Peter reached out and ruffled your hair before he crawled back out the window. You laughed awkwardly, slowly smoothing your hair back down. You couldn\u2019t wipe the smile off your face.</p><p>You turned the lamp back off and slid back under the covers. This time you couldn\u2019t fall asleep.</p><hr><p>After Peter climbed up the fire escape and reached the roof of your apartment building, he remembered the interaction he just had with you.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI just ruffled her hair,\u201d he said to himself. \u201cIs she a dog? What were you thinking?\u201d</p><p>He paced up and down the roof, going through his head everything that had happened until he suddenly halted.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cShe said yes. Karen, did you hear that?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI did, Peter,\u201d replied Karen, Spiderman\u2019s user interface. \u201cCongratulations.\u201d</p><p>Peter grinned harder, jumping up and down. Ever since they started selling tickets for prom, Peter was hesitant. He wondered who you\u2019d go with, not even considering himself as a potential partner. You were always the confident, bubbly person who got along with everyone. He expected everyone to be lining up to be your date. Peter assumed he had left it too late until Ned told him that afternoon that no one had asked you yet.</p><p>Peter had spent all day bucking up the courage to ask you, that\u2019s why at 2:30 in the morning he came knocking on your window. And how relieved he was when you said yes.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThis is your chance to ask her to be your girlfriend,\u201d Karen said.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI-I-I don\u2019t know\u2026\u201d Peter sat down on the roof, dangling his feet over the edge.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou obviously like her, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYeah,\u201d Peter replied. \u201cI like her a lot. But we\u2019ve been friends for so long. What if I screw things up?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou won\u2019t know unless you try.\u201d</p><p>Peter nodded, knowing Karen was right. Peter\u2019s never been afraid of taking chances; he was a known risk-taker. But this was different. He cared for you so much and valued your friendship more than anything and if he lost that, he\u2019d be heart-broken.</p><p>If only he knew\u2026</p><hr><p>A few weeks later, the day had finally arrived. Peter dressed himself in a rented tux that May said made him look like a movie star. He put gel in his curls to hold them down, knowing how unreliable and messy they became sometimes.</p><p>He adjusted his bow tie in the mirror, making sure it was straight. Peter realised how much unnecessary pressure he was putting on himself, hoping that this night would go perfectly. He was especially nervous about the fact that he was going to confess his feelings. He planned to save it for the end of the night as to not ruin the evening if you didn\u2019t feel the same way.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou look so handsome, Peter,\u201d May said, leaning on the door frame. She picked up the silver and white corsage on his desk and passed it to him. \u201cIf she doesn\u2019t fall in love with you tonight, I\u2019d assume she\u2019s got something wrong with her.\u201d</p><p>Peter smiled. \u201cThanks, Aunt May. I\u2019ll see you when I get home.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cTwelve o\u2019clock. Don\u2019t forget.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>With that, Peter kissed May on the cheek then headed out the door.</p><p>Peter clenched his trembling hand and knocked on the door. He took a deep breath and waited, bouncing on his tip toes. The door opened and Peter quickly looked up. Standing before him in a floor-length silver dress, you greeted Peter with a smile. Peter lost his breath at the sight of you.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWow,\u201d he whispered, his lips forming a big grin. \u201cYou-you look amazing.\u201d</p><p>You laughed nervously, running your hand down the side of your dress. \u201cReally? I think I look a little bit strange. Not myself.\u201d</p><p>Peter shook his head, his smile never faltering. \u201cYou look\u2026 really pretty. I mean, you always look pretty but-\u201d</p><p>You laughed, reaching out the take Peter\u2019s hand and squeezing it. \u201cThank you, Peter.\u201d You pulled him inside. \u201cYou look great too.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cUm, here.\u201d Peter took the corsage out of it\u2019s case and slid it onto your wrist.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThank you. I love it,\u201d you said, holding your arm out in front of you and admiring the flowers.</p><p>Your father dropped the pair of you off at school and Peter helped you out of the car. Prom was a lot different from homecoming a few years ago. It was the worst night of Peter\u2019s life, a night he\u2019d never forget. Peter wouldn\u2019t forget this night either, hopefully for different reasons, but so far, so good.</p><p>You linked your arm in Peter\u2019s and the two of you walked inside. Silver and white balloons studded the roof of the gymnasium with white lights shaped as stars floating around the room. A disco ball hung in the middle, reflecting light all around. Music played loudly in the background with students already dancing.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cPeter! Y/N!\u201d Ned called. Him, Betty and MJ were sitting in the bleachers.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHey guys,\u201d Peter said once the pair of you approached them. Betty and Ned were holding each other\u2019s hands, sitting closely next to one another. Peter imagined you and him sitting like that and he couldn\u2019t help but feel a surge of energy.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou all look amazing,\u201d you said.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cSo do you,\u201d Betty replied cheerfully. \u201cYou and Peter look like movie stars.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cFlash told us he\u2019s gonna try and spike the punch tonight so watch out,\u201d MJ said, nodding her head towards the food and drinks table. The group looked over and saw Flash slowly pacing around the table, making sure no one was looking. He spotted the group staring at him and he waved his hand, frowning, signalling them to look away.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOh man, he\u2019s gonna get kicked out,\u201d you laughed.</p><p>A new song from the DJ started to play and Betty shot up, grabbing yours and MJ\u2019s hands.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI love this song, come on!\u201d</p><p>She pulled the pair of you onto the dance floor and Peter and Ned followed. In a circle, the five of you started to dance. Jumping up and down, singing and laughing, you were all starting to have the best night of your high school lives. It seemed to hit you all at the same time that when this year ends, you won\u2019t be seeing each other every day. Peter found this to be the most difficult to handle, feeling more and more pressure against what he wanted to confess to you tonight.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI love you guys!\u201d Ned said, pulling you all into a group hug.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWe love you too!\u201d</p><p>Later, Peter and Ned left to get a drink. The pair of them stood by the food table and watched the rest of the students dancing and having a good time. Flash was unsuccessful in his attempts to spike the punch however he was allowed to stay. Peter saw him dancing closer to the DJ and often putting in song requests.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cSo, are you gonna tell her tonight?\u201d Ned asked.</p><p>Peter laughed nervously. \u201cI was planning on it, but I don\u2019t know. Y/N looks like she\u2019s having a lot of fun.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou\u2019ve got to do it, Peter.\u201d Ned placed his hand on Peter\u2019s shoulder. \u201cShe likes you.\u201d</p><p>Peter looked at Ned, wide-eyed. \u201cShe does? Did she tell you that?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cNo, but I can tell. Haven\u2019t you noticed the way she looks at you? She was giving you that look the whole night.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhat look? I haven\u2019t seen any look.\u201d Peter looked at you, still dancing with Betty and MJ. You looked happy, singing along with the girls. Peter was always so taken with how beautiful and amazing you were but tonight, he felt like he was falling in love.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThe look of love, Peter. The look of love.\u201d Ned put his cup on the table. \u201cNow, I hear a slow song is coming up so I\u2019m going to dance with my girlfriend.\u201d</p><p>Peter took a deep breath and finished off his drink. He shook his hands, trying to shake the nerves out. He watched as Ned pulled Betty away, then as MJ was pulled away with her date. You were left standing alone on the dance floor. Peter saw your eyes searching for his through the crowd. He approached you and you finally met his eyes. The slow song started. It was <i>Fade Into You</i> by Mazzy Star.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cDo you wanna dance?\u201d</p><p>You smiled. \u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>Peter placed his hands on your hips while you snaked your arms around his neck. The pair of you softly swayed to the music, feeling awkward all of a sudden.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI love this song,\u201d you said, filling the silence between you.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cMe too.\u201d</p><p>You looked away from Peter, watching all the other couples. They all looked at their partners like they were the only humans on earth. They looked comfortable with one another.</p><p>As you looked away, Peter stared at you. He got the feeling you weren\u2019t interested in him at all. But he wasn\u2019t going to back out now.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cY/N,\u201d he said quietly.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHmm?\u201d</p><p>You looked into his eyes and Peter felt butterflies. He studied your face for a moment, forgetting what he was going to say. He noticed your make up, light glittery pink eyeshadow decorated your eyes and shiny highlighter defined your cheekbones. Peter\u2019s seen you without make-up before and thought you looked beautiful either way. But right now, he was enraptured, lost in your eyes.</p><p>You let out a small laugh. \u201cAre you okay, Peter? You\u2019ve been acting strange all night.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m just nervous,\u201d he replied.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cNervous about what?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI like you, Y/N.\u201d</p><p>The smile of your face was one of happiness and relief. \u201cI like you too, Peter.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou-you do?\u201d</p><p>Peter felt your hand move to his cheek before you pressed your lips to his. He was surprised but he didn\u2019t break away. He wrapped his arms around you, pulling you closer.</p><p>After a few seconds, you pulled away but kept your face closely to his. You smiled, the heat rising in your cheeks as you looked at Peter. You never imagined you\u2019d be here, in Peter\u2019s arms and kissing his lips. The feeling made you laugh.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cWhat?\u201d Peter asked, laughing with you.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m just happy.\u201d You leaned your head on Peter\u2019s chest, closing your eyes as the pair of you continued to sway.</p><p>Peter rested his cheek on your head, his grin never faltering. This night, this song, this girl in his arms, he was never going to forget; he wouldn\u2019t let himself.</p><hr><p>taglist: <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mhyPBbIblxeqerGJEFSKQow\" target=\"_blank\">@bravest-at-heart</a> | <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/md9-kNdcfzVno1sOaFWpU5Q\" target=\"_blank\">@petersshirts</a> | <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_eNGNK44IX0-h-Fqi9rIdw\" target=\"_blank\">@peterstrainingwheels</a></p></p>",

It was infectious. His smile was something you always marvelled at. It was difficult to hide your feelings for Peter considering you weren&rsquo;t sure whether or not he liked you back. Peter&rsquo;s an awkward kid, you never understood anything he said or did half the time anyway.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;What are you smiling about it?&rdquo; you asked.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Will you go to prom with me?&rdquo;</p><p>You froze, trying to register what he just said. You definitely weren&rsquo;t expecting it. Prom wasn&rsquo;t for a few more weeks, but that wasn&rsquo;t the part that struck you. You couldn&rsquo;t imagine Peter would ask you to prom. Considering what happened at homecoming, you didn&rsquo;t even think Peter would want to go.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p><p>Peter&rsquo;s smile fell. &ldquo;Prom? You forgot, didn&rsquo;t you? Oh, you&rsquo;re going with someone else. It&rsquo;s Flash, isn&rsquo;t it? Isn&rsquo;t it? Oh god, I knew I shouldn&rsquo;t&rsquo;ve said-&rdquo;</p><p>You reached out and covered Peter&rsquo;s mouth to stop him from talking. Instantly his cheeks heated up, turning red.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;I will go to prom with you, Peter, just calm down,&rdquo; you said, laughing.</p><p>Peter&rsquo;s smile returned. He actually looked relieved. &ldquo;Cool. Uh, the theme is Under the Stars, if you forgot.&rdquo;</p><p>You shook your head. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t forget. I&rsquo;ll wear something shiny.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter chuckled. &ldquo;Cool, so&hellip; it&rsquo;s a date.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a date.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;See you then&hellip;then.&rdquo; Peter reached out and ruffled your hair before he crawled back out the window. You laughed awkwardly, slowly smoothing your hair back down. You couldn&rsquo;t wipe the smile off your face.</p><p>You turned the lamp back off and slid back under the covers. This time you couldn&rsquo;t fall asleep.</p><hr /><p>After Peter climbed up the fire escape and reached the roof of your apartment building, he remembered the interaction he just had with you.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;I just ruffled her hair,&rdquo; he said to himself. &ldquo;Is she a dog? What were you thinking?&rdquo;</p><p>He paced up and down the roof, going through his head everything that had happened until he suddenly halted.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;She said yes. Karen, did you hear that?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;I did, Peter,&rdquo; replied Karen, Spiderman&rsquo;s user interface. &ldquo;Congratulations.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter grinned harder, jumping up and down. Ever since they started selling tickets for prom, Peter was hesitant. He wondered who you&rsquo;d go with, not even considering himself as a potential partner. You were always the confident, bubbly person who got along with everyone. He expected everyone to be lining up to be your date. Peter assumed he had left it too late until Ned told him that afternoon that no one had asked you yet.</p><p>Peter had spent all day bucking up the courage to ask you, that&rsquo;s why at 2:30 in the morning he came knocking on your window. And how relieved he was when you said yes.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;This is your chance to ask her to be your girlfriend,&rdquo; Karen said.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;I-I-I don&rsquo;t know&hellip;&rdquo; Peter sat down on the roof, dangling his feet over the edge.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;You obviously like her, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; Peter replied. &ldquo;I like her a lot. But we&rsquo;ve been friends for so long. What if I screw things up?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t know unless you try.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter nodded, knowing Karen was right. Peter&rsquo;s never been afraid of taking chances; he was a known risk-taker. But this was different. He cared for you so much and valued your friendship more than anything and if he lost that, he&rsquo;d be heart-broken.</p><p>If only he knew&hellip;</p><hr /><p>A few weeks later, the day had finally arrived. Peter dressed himself in a rented tux that May said made him look like a movie star. He put gel in his curls to hold them down, knowing how unreliable and messy they became sometimes.</p><p>He adjusted his bow tie in the mirror, making sure it was straight. Peter realised how much unnecessary pressure he was putting on himself, hoping that this night would go perfectly. He was especially nervous about the fact that he was going to confess his feelings. He planned to save it for the end of the night as to not ruin the evening if you didn&rsquo;t feel the same way.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;You look so handsome, Peter,&rdquo; May said, leaning on the door frame. She picked up the silver and white corsage on his desk and passed it to him. &ldquo;If she doesn&rsquo;t fall in love with you tonight, I&rsquo;d assume she&rsquo;s got something wrong with her.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter smiled. &ldquo;Thanks, Aunt May. I&rsquo;ll see you when I get home.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Twelve o&rsquo;clock. Don&rsquo;t forget.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p><p>With that, Peter kissed May on the cheek then headed out the door.</p><p>Peter clenched his trembling hand and knocked on the door. He took a deep breath and waited, bouncing on his tip toes. The door opened and Peter quickly looked up. Standing before him in a floor-length silver dress, you greeted Peter with a smile. Peter lost his breath at the sight of you.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Wow,&rdquo; he whispered, his lips forming a big grin. &ldquo;You-you look amazing.&rdquo;</p><p>You laughed nervously, running your hand down the side of your dress. &ldquo;Really? I think I look a little bit strange. Not myself.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter shook his head, his smile never faltering. &ldquo;You look&hellip; really pretty. I mean, you always look pretty but-&rdquo;</p><p>You laughed, reaching out the take Peter&rsquo;s hand and squeezing it. &ldquo;Thank you, Peter.&rdquo; You pulled him inside. &ldquo;You look great too.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Um, here.&rdquo; Peter took the corsage out of it&rsquo;s case and slid it onto your wrist.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Thank you. I love it,&rdquo; you said, holding your arm out in front of you and admiring the flowers.</p><p>Your father dropped the pair of you off at school and Peter helped you out of the car. Prom was a lot different from homecoming a few years ago. It was the worst night of Peter&rsquo;s life, a night he&rsquo;d never forget. Peter wouldn&rsquo;t forget this night either, hopefully for different reasons, but so far, so good.</p><p>You linked your arm in Peter&rsquo;s and the two of you walked inside. Silver and white balloons studded the roof of the gymnasium with white lights shaped as stars floating around the room. A disco ball hung in the middle, reflecting light all around. Music played loudly in the background with students already dancing.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Peter! Y/N!&rdquo; Ned called. Him, Betty and MJ were sitting in the bleachers.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Hey guys,&rdquo; Peter said once the pair of you approached them. Betty and Ned were holding each other&rsquo;s hands, sitting closely next to one another. Peter imagined you and him sitting like that and he couldn&rsquo;t help but feel a surge of energy.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;You all look amazing,&rdquo; you said.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;So do you,&rdquo; Betty replied cheerfully. &ldquo;You and Peter look like movie stars.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Flash told us he&rsquo;s gonna try and spike the punch tonight so watch out,&rdquo; MJ said, nodding her head towards the food and drinks table. The group looked over and saw Flash slowly pacing around the table, making sure no one was looking. He spotted the group staring at him and he waved his hand, frowning, signalling them to look away.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Oh man, he&rsquo;s gonna get kicked out,&rdquo; you laughed.</p><p>A new song from the DJ started to play and Betty shot up, grabbing yours and MJ&rsquo;s hands.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;I love this song, come on!&rdquo;</p><p>She pulled the pair of you onto the dance floor and Peter and Ned followed. In a circle, the five of you started to dance. Jumping up and down, singing and laughing, you were all starting to have the best night of your high school lives. It seemed to hit you all at the same time that when this year ends, you won&rsquo;t be seeing each other every day. Peter found this to be the most difficult to handle, feeling more and more pressure against what he wanted to confess to you tonight.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;I love you guys!&rdquo; Ned said, pulling you all into a group hug.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;We love you too!&rdquo;</p><p>Later, Peter and Ned left to get a drink. The pair of them stood by the food table and watched the rest of the students dancing and having a good time. Flash was unsuccessful in his attempts to spike the punch however he was allowed to stay. Peter saw him dancing closer to the DJ and often putting in song requests.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;So, are you gonna tell her tonight?&rdquo; Ned asked.</p><p>Peter laughed nervously. &ldquo;I was planning on it, but I don&rsquo;t know. Y/N looks like she&rsquo;s having a lot of fun.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got to do it, Peter.&rdquo; Ned placed his hand on Peter&rsquo;s shoulder. &ldquo;She likes you.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter looked at Ned, wide-eyed. &ldquo;She does? Did she tell you that?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;No, but I can tell. Haven&rsquo;t you noticed the way she looks at you? She was giving you that look the whole night.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;What look? I haven&rsquo;t seen any look.&rdquo; Peter looked at you, still dancing with Betty and MJ. You looked happy, singing along with the girls. Peter was always so taken with how beautiful and amazing you were but tonight, he felt like he was falling in love.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;The look of love, Peter. The look of love.&rdquo; Ned put his cup on the table. &ldquo;Now, I hear a slow song is coming up so I&rsquo;m going to dance with my girlfriend.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter took a deep breath and finished off his drink. He shook his hands, trying to shake the nerves out. He watched as Ned pulled Betty away, then as MJ was pulled away with her date. You were left standing alone on the dance floor. Peter saw your eyes searching for his through the crowd. He approached you and you finally met his eyes. The slow song started. It was <i>Fade Into You</i> by Mazzy Star.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Do you wanna dance?&rdquo;</p><p>You smiled. &ldquo;Sure.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter placed his hands on your hips while you snaked your arms around his neck. The pair of you softly swayed to the music, feeling awkward all of a sudden.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;I love this song,&rdquo; you said, filling the silence between you.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Me too.&rdquo;</p><p>You looked away from Peter, watching all the other couples. They all looked at their partners like they were the only humans on earth. They looked comfortable with one another.</p><p>As you looked away, Peter stared at you. He got the feeling you weren&rsquo;t interested in him at all. But he wasn&rsquo;t going to back out now.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Y/N,&rdquo; he said quietly.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Hmm?&rdquo;</p><p>You looked into his eyes and Peter felt butterflies. He studied your face for a moment, forgetting what he was going to say. He noticed your make up, light glittery pink eyeshadow decorated your eyes and shiny highlighter defined your cheekbones. Peter&rsquo;s seen you without make-up before and thought you looked beautiful either way. But right now, he was enraptured, lost in your eyes.</p><p>You let out a small laugh. &ldquo;Are you okay, Peter? You&rsquo;ve been acting strange all night.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just nervous,&rdquo; he replied.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Nervous about what?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;I like you, Y/N.&rdquo;</p><p>The smile of your face was one of happiness and relief. &ldquo;I like you too, Peter.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;You-you do?&rdquo;</p><p>Peter felt your hand move to his cheek before you pressed your lips to his. He was surprised but he didn&rsquo;t break away. He wrapped his arms around you, pulling you closer.</p><p>After a few seconds, you pulled away but kept your face closely to his. You smiled, the heat rising in your cheeks as you looked at Peter. You never imagined you&rsquo;d be here, in Peter&rsquo;s arms and kissing his lips. The feeling made you laugh.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &ldquo;What?&rdquo; Peter asked, laughing with you.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just happy.&rdquo; You leaned your head on Peter&rsquo;s chest, closing your eyes as the pair of you continued to sway.</p><p>Peter rested his cheek on your head, his grin never faltering. This night, this song, this girl in his arms, he was never going to forget; he wouldn&rsquo;t let himself.</p><hr /><p>taglist: <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mhyPBbIblxeqerGJEFSKQow\" target=\"_blank\">@bravest-at-heart</a> | <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/md9-kNdcfzVno1sOaFWpU5Q\" target=\"_blank\">@petersshirts</a> | <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_eNGNK44IX0-h-Fqi9rIdw\" target=\"_blank\">@peterstrainingwheels</a></p></p>",

It demanded rest.</p>\n<p>You closed your laptop then turned off the lamp sitting beside it. You peeled yourself slowly out of your chair and crawled onto your bed before sliding under the sheets. You closed your eyes and it was the best feeling in the world.</p>\n<p>Your phone, that was still sitting on the desk, vibrated, alerting you that you received a text.
