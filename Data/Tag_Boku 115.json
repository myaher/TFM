Even though she\u2019s anxious about graduating in the \nspring, she\u2019ll have time to relax, enjoy the slopes and hang out with \nher best friend.<br/>Shouto is not thrilled to be stuck with his \nfather for the entirety of his winter break. It\u2019s anything but a \nvacation. Even with his siblings there, everything reminds him of his \npast and he just wants to get back to finishing school and moving on.<br/>When\n the two continuously run into each other at the lodge, both of them \nrealize their vacations aren\u2019t going to be what either of them expected.<br/><br/><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/16851022/chapters/42550637\">Read on AO3</a><br/><br/>Thanks to <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m9Z3xF4a7jao2Xy-1acpZzw\">@its-love-u-asshole</a> for reading this! <br/></small></p><p><small>Climbing the stairs to the top of the lodge building, Shouto was \nthrilled to be getting some time to himself. Just as Yaoyorozu had \npointed out, there was a large rooftop deck, completely empty minus her.\n Currently she was leaning over the railing, her long dark hair \nfluttering in the cool night air. She hadn&rsquo;t been kidding when she \ncasually mentioned it was cold. Cold was&hellip; an understatement.</small></p><p><small>Zipping\n up his jacket, Shouto let the door shut behind him. Immediately \nYaoyorozu turned around and waved, smiling at him. He nuzzled his nose \nagainst the collar of his coat and walked towards the edge of the deck \nwhere she stood.</small></p><p><small>There was something about her Shouto couldn&rsquo;t \nquite place. He didn&rsquo;t know this girl at all, and yet he felt drawn to \nher. She was beautiful, probably one of the most beautiful girls he had \never encountered, but it wasn&rsquo;t her beauty which drew him in. She seemed\n genuine, kind and easily excited, but still poised, classy, and well \nput together. He found himself impressed by her.</small></p><!-- more --><p>It was why his feet kept walking towards her even now.</p><p>&ldquo;Ah! \nTodoroki-san!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you were able to find it. T-Though I \nsuppose it wouldn&rsquo;t be too difficult to find a rooftop deck.&rdquo; She \nlaughed at herself, though he could sense she seemed nervous. &ldquo;A-Anyway,\n I&rsquo;ll stop talking now so you can have some peace and quiet. I \nunderstand how sometimes a vacation doesn&rsquo;t feel like one unless you&hellip; \ntake some time to yourself.&rdquo;</p><p>A small smile pulled across his face. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind talking to you, Yaoyorozu-san. You&rsquo;re very refreshing.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A-Am I?!&rdquo; she squeaked, shock crossing her features.</p><p>&ldquo;Trust me,&rdquo; he muttered, leaning against the railing. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re far better than dealing with my father at dinner.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I\n see&hellip;&rdquo; she said softly. Her pale face was illuminated by the fairy \nlights which trailed around the deck. They twinkled against the snow, \nsome of them covered with the freezing white dust. The slopes before \nthem were mostly dark, minus two small trails still lit for those who \nchose to go night skiing. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, but&hellip; I do understand,&rdquo; she \nadmitted. &ldquo;My parents haven&rsquo;t been the best this year either.&rdquo; A sad \nlook crossed her eyes, and Shouto wanted to ask her more, but felt it \nwasn&rsquo;t his place.</p><p>&ldquo;You&hellip; come here every year, correct?&rdquo; he asked, glancing towards her.</p><p>Immediately\n her face lit up. &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; she said, clapping her hands together. &ldquo;I know I\n mentioned it before, but this is my favorite place in the whole world.&rdquo;\n She smiled, glancing out at the mountain. &ldquo;The air is fresh, the snow \nis beautiful, and I have so many wonderful memories here.&rdquo;</p><p>Shouto couldn&rsquo;t help but smile, the energy radiating off of her was contagious. &ldquo;Mmm,&rdquo; he nodded. &ldquo;You can tell you love it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m\n glad! I hope whatever is going on with your family doesn&rsquo;t ruin this \nplace because it really is incredible,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m trying not to let\n my parents get to me too much. Thankfully, Kyouka-chan is here. We met \nhere actually, and we&rsquo;ve been friends ever since. Both our families \nalways come during winter break.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That so?&rdquo; he said, listening to her speak so excitedly about her favorite place.</p><p>&ldquo;Mhm!&rdquo;\n she nodded. &ldquo;I love spending time with Kyouka-chan.&rdquo; She shut her eyes \nand pulled in a long breath of air. &ldquo;But I also love being out on the \nmountain.&rdquo;</p><p>There was a time when he would&rsquo;ve probably agreed. \nThough he had never been to this lodge specifically, being out on the \nslopes and skiing through the snow was important to him. He could \nactually connect with his mother when he was out in the snow, it felt \nlike she was there, skiing right beside him.</p><p>But lately it was \nhard to feel nostalgic when his father was breathing down their necks, \nsetting a schedule for their vacation. Did he expect them to have fun? \nHe supposed that was probably what his father wanted, especially since \nhe was wanting to &lsquo;play games&rsquo;&hellip; though Shouto could only imagine what a\n disaster that would be.</p><p>&ldquo;I used to love that, but this trip has been&hellip; nothing but a headache,&rdquo; he sighed, leaning forward against the railing.</p><p>&ldquo;Ah?\n I-I&rsquo;m sorry, Todoroki-san,&rdquo; Yaoyorozu said quickly. She bowed her head.\n &ldquo;I can keep quiet so you can have a peaceful moment!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he \nchuckled, laughing at how quick she was to be nervous. &ldquo;I already said I\n don&rsquo;t mind listening to you speak. Actually, hearing you talk so fondly\n of this place makes me&hellip; like it more.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Really?!&rdquo; she said, her\n dark eyes shimmering with excitement. She reached forward and grabbed \nhis hands. &ldquo;It really is amazing here. There&rsquo;s so much to do and the \nscenery is so calming and beautiful! And the food is also amazing. I-I \nmean you already ate at the best restaurant but-&rdquo; She paused, as if she \nsuddenly realized they were now holding hands. She jumped back a bit, \nrunning her gloved hands over the railing. &ldquo;S-Sorry, Todoroki-san&hellip; I \nget so excited and since things have been a little stressful&hellip; I was \nhappy to share fond memories!&rdquo;</p><p>Cute.</p><p>Oh gosh, was she cute. \nHe thought back to his father being so frustrated this girl could \npotentially be a distraction for him. Admittedly, Shouto had never \nthought too much about romance or girls&hellip; or any sort of relationships \nas he often kept to himself. He didn&rsquo;t have time to focus on other \npeople, not with the intense study schedule his father often prepared \nfor him.</p><p>But what if&hellip;</p><p>What if, just this once, he allowed himself the distraction?</p><p>He\n watched her for a moment, her gaze staring at her hands, as if she was \nso embarrassed she had accidentally held his hand for a short period of \ntime.</p><p>&ldquo;Please, Yaoyorozu-san, don&rsquo;t apologize. I like hearing you talk about&hellip; something you love.&rdquo;</p><p><i>'You look beautiful.&rsquo;</i>\n The words hung on the tip of his tongue. He barely knew her, and he \ncouldn&rsquo;t just blurt these things out. She would probably look at him \nlike he was some sort of creep.</p><p>&ldquo;O-Oh&hellip;&rdquo; she said, and giggled. \n&ldquo;Well, what about you, Todoroki-san?&rdquo; she asked, leaning against the \nrailing. &ldquo;What is something you love?&rdquo;</p><p>He froze. Something he loved? What was&hellip; something he loved?</p><p>&ldquo;Cold soba.&rdquo;</p><p>How\n lame. He mentally slapped his hand against his forehead. She was going \nto think he was some sort of idiot; he was certain she didn&rsquo;t mean what \nhis favorite food was.</p><p>&ldquo;Cold&hellip; soba?&rdquo; she asked, tilting her \nhead. She giggled softly, the sound echoing on the winter wind. It \nwarmed him, even with the cool night air surrounding them.</p><p>&ldquo;That&hellip;\n ah&hellip; uhm&hellip; &rdquo; He turned away from her, not wanting her to see how his \ncheeks were currently as red as his left portion of hair.</p><p>&ldquo;Soba is quite tasty so, I understand!&rdquo;</p><p>She was just being nice.</p><p>&ldquo;Sorry&hellip;&rdquo; he mumbled. &ldquo;That probably wasn&rsquo;t the answer you were expecting.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Admittedly, no!&rdquo; she laughed. &ldquo;But it was&hellip; very endearing.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;&hellip;I suppose,&rdquo; he sighed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s&hellip; difficult for me to say what I really, truly love.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I\n can assure you, Todoroki-san,&rdquo; Yaoyorozu smiled. &ldquo;This is a very safe \nspace.&rdquo; She placed her hand over her chest and stood up straight. &ldquo;I \nswear, anything you tell me will not leave this rooftop deck.&rdquo;</p><p>His eye widened as he watched her.</p><p>\n \u00a0<i>Cute!</i>\n</p><p>It made his chest clench a little. Was this what it meant to have a crush?</p><p>It was a foolish feeling, since he most likely wouldn&rsquo;t see her after this vacation was over&hellip; and yet&hellip;</p><p>He didn&rsquo;t hate the way his heart fluttered when he looked at her.</p><p>He\n nodded his head at her. &ldquo;Thank you, Yaoyorozu-san. It&rsquo;s not that I \ndon&rsquo;t trust you.&rdquo; In fact, there was something very appealing about \nspeaking to her. She didn&rsquo;t know him, had no bias towards him or his \npast or how he acted in school. However, he didn&rsquo;t want to make a \ncomplete fool of himself.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m glad I seem trustworthy!&rdquo; she smiled.</p><p>&ldquo;Mhm,&rdquo; he nodded. &ldquo;I suppose&hellip; it&rsquo;s hard for me to say it because I&rsquo;m not sure what I love.&rdquo;</p><p>Her\n brow furrowed, looking at him with such concern. There was a part of \nhim that regretted speaking up, because he much preferred when he was \nable to make her smile.</p><p>&ldquo;Can I ask what you mean?&rdquo; she said softly, her dark eyes waiting patiently for him to speak.</p><p>&ldquo;My\n father,&rdquo; he began slowly, &ldquo;he wants me to take over his company. He&rsquo;s a\n businessman. My whole life he&rsquo;s been pushing me. It&rsquo;s always been my \nonly purpose.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Your whole life?&rdquo; she asked, gently prodding for more information, though nothing about her tone or demeanor was pushy.</p><p>&ldquo;Mmm&hellip;&rdquo;\n he nodded. &ldquo;My eldest brother was sickly as a child and deemed \nunworthy. He&rsquo;s studying abroad now to be a doctor. My sister, as a \nwoman, was not worthy to him&hellip; Natsuo, the brother you met, he is far \ntoo easily distractible and my father couldn&rsquo;t put up with it,&rdquo; he \nexplained. &ldquo;Then there was me, and I am being molded into his perfect \nlittle heir.&rdquo; There was a bite to his tone and he turned towards the \nrailing, staring at the snow pooled on top of it.</p><p>He swallowed, \nwondering if he had said too much. It wasn&rsquo;t like him to speak about his\n family so freely, but Yaoyorozu made him feel so comfortable.</p><p>&ldquo;Todoroki-san,&rdquo;\n she whispered, reaching over to place her gloved hand over his. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so\n sorry. Is business something you&rsquo;re interested in?&rdquo; she asked. Her \nvoice was so genuine, and even through his glove, he could feel the \ngentle pressure and squeeze from her hand.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I&rsquo;ve \nnever been given the freedom to think about it,&rdquo; he admitted. He wasn\u2019t \nsure anyone had ever even asked him a question like that.</p><p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;Are there any&hellip; hobbies you have that you enjoy? Something you pull joy from?&rdquo; she asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Mmm.&rdquo; Shouto hummed softly. &ldquo;I enjoy this. Skiing, I mean. Or I used to.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What changed?&rdquo; she asked.</p><p>Shouto\n froze, his heart suddenly throbbing in his ears. He knew exactly what \nchanged, but the words were trapped in his throat. He couldn&rsquo;t just say \nit, could he?</p><p>\n \u00a0<i>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s your mother&hellip;&rdquo;</i>\n</p><p>\n \u00a0<i>&ldquo;She&hellip;&rdquo;</i>\n</p><p>&ldquo;I&hellip;&rdquo; He let out a soft breath, a heated cloud curling in the air in front of him. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he lied.</p><p>&ldquo;I\n see,&rdquo; she whispered. Maybe she could tell he wasn&rsquo;t giving her the full\n story, but she was far too polite to ask for any further details.</p><p>&ldquo;What\n about you,&rdquo; he asked, changing the subject. Dwelling on his mother was \nnever good for his mental state, and so far the majority of this trip \nhad brought back nostalgic memories which made his heart ache. He didn&rsquo;t\n want to think about it, not when he was spending time with her. He had \ntalked about himself far too much already.</p><p>&ldquo;Me?&rdquo; she gasped. &ldquo;I-I&hellip; admittedly after hearing your story I feel a little foolish,&rdquo; she said.</p><p>&ldquo;What? Please Yaoyorozu-san, that wasn&rsquo;t my intention,&rdquo; he urged.</p><p>&ldquo;I-I\n know!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s silly. My parents keep pressuring me to decide \nwhat I want to do with my future. I&rsquo;ve been accepted to the university I\n wanted and unlike you, my father doesn&rsquo;t mind if I take a different \npath with my life&hellip; however, I know he wants me in a stable position. \nYou should&rsquo;ve heard him tonight,&rdquo; she laughed sadly. &ldquo;Kyouka is a \nmusician and he was <i>very</i> concerned I planned on following her.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ah, parents,&rdquo; Shouto sighed.</p><p>&ldquo;Right?&rdquo;\n she said, sighing along with him. &ldquo;I actually really enjoy chemistry, \nbut I have no idea if my father would approve. I don&rsquo;t know where \nexactly I can go and be a chemist. Maybe I could teach&hellip;&rdquo; she babbled, \nnervously stroking the end of her hair between her gloved fingers. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s\n overwhelming, to think about and consider your future. I was hoping \nthis trip would be a nice break from it all, but almost every dinner my \nfather brings it up.&rdquo;</p><p>They had opposite problems. Shouto was being\n forced into a set future, one he couldn&rsquo;t change, and Yaoyorozu was \nspiraling along an uncertain path, one she couldn&rsquo;t decide upon.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve\n mentioned it to Kyouka, but her family is so relaxed and supportive of \nher music, she tends to not understand why I don&rsquo;t just choose what I \nwant,&rdquo; she continued. &ldquo;While that&rsquo;s nice to think about, I worry my \nfather won&rsquo;t approve.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; he nodded.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s not pleasant to hear about my horribly wishy-washy decisions.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Please, pressure, regardless of what form, is never pleasant,&rdquo; he muttered. He knew this quite well.</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you, Todoroki-san,&rdquo; she said, bowing to him. &ldquo;I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well\n thank you for doing the same,&rdquo; he chuckled, nodding. He did feel a bit \nguilty for speaking to her so much, but at the same time&hellip; she had been\n so open with him too. In a strange way, he felt she understood him.</p><p>&ldquo;Perhaps we could&hellip; speak up here again sometime in the next week and a half,&rdquo; she said, a smile pulling across her features.</p><p>He would&rsquo;ve spoken to her up here every night if he could.</p><p>&ldquo;I would like that. You&rsquo;re right, it is very peaceful and calm up here.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Mhm,&rdquo; she said and placed her finger against her lips. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a secret! But I&rsquo;m happy to share it with you.&rdquo;</p><p>He bowed his head to her and chuckled. &ldquo;I feel quite honored to know about it then.&rdquo;</p><p>She\n nodded and reluctantly pulled her hand away from his, realizing she \nstill had it resting over his. &ldquo;I-I do wish you could come to the party \ntomorrow night, but I understand your father is quite intense!&rdquo; she \nsighed.</p><p>He clenched his hands around the railing. He wanted more \nthan anything to come to the party and spend more time with her. \n&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll&hellip; make it,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll figure out a way to get away from him \nand-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ah! Please don&rsquo;t get in trouble, Todoroki-san!&rdquo; she said, her eyes shimmering with nervousness.</p><p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he chuckled.</p><p>The\n two of them stayed on the roof for a bit longer, letting the night \nslowly wear on. For now they were free from their burdens, their \nfamilies slept soundly while they spoke into the night, and Shouto knew \nhe had to get to that party, no matter what.</p><p>~~</p><p>&ldquo;Someone&rsquo;s \nglowing,&rdquo; Kyouka said, flopping onto Momo&rsquo;s bed. The two met up after \nskiing and showering the next day. The party was only a few hours away \nand the two girls had plans to get dinner and head over to the pool.</p><p>&ldquo;Glowing?!&rdquo; she gasped and slid the closet door open, searching through the clothes she hung up. &ldquo;I-I don&rsquo;t know about that.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Have you been texting with Todoroki?&rdquo; she teased.</p><p>&ldquo;Well&hellip;&rdquo;\n she cleared her throat. &ldquo;We actually spent some time together on the \nroof.&rdquo; She braced herself, ready for the reaction from her friend.</p><p>&ldquo;<i>What?!</i> Yaoyorozu Momo, taking a <i>boy</i> up to her very special spot?!&rdquo; Kyouka gasped, clutching her hand against her chest as she leaned forward on the bed.</p><p>&ldquo;K-Kyouka!\n It wasn&rsquo;t a big deal. He was having a difficult time with his father \nand so I invited him up for some peace and quiet.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sure, sure,&rdquo; \nshe nodded, folding her arms over her chest. &ldquo;Peace and quiet, and then \nyou proceeded to talk his ear off I assume.&rdquo;</p><p>Momo popped her head out of the closet, her cheeks bright red. &ldquo;Oh gosh&hellip; I probably did talk too much!&rdquo;</p><p>Kyouka scoffed. &ldquo;I doubt you did, I was just making a joke.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;R-Right&hellip;&rdquo;\n Momo sighed. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know it was&hellip; pleasant. I think we sort of \nunderstood each other even though our problems are <i>very</i> \ndifferent.&rdquo; She smiled, glancing towards her window as she pulled a \nsweater off of the hanger. &ldquo;And he did say he was going to try and make \nit to the party tonight.&rdquo; She hummed, clutching the sweater to her chest\n as she rocked back and forth happily.</p><p>&ldquo;Great. So are you ready to admit this crush you have on him?&rdquo; Kyouka smirked, raising her eyebrow at her best friend.</p><p>&ldquo;Huh?!&rdquo;\n She froze. Admittedly, she had an amazing time on the roof last night. \nBesides Kyouka, she couldn&rsquo;t remember ever connecting with someone that \nfast. They spoke for so long and Todoroki admitted his love of soba \nnoodles and his frustrations with his family. She too, had admitted her \nown frustrations, though hearing his did make her feel a little guilty.</p><p>She\n wanted to say she liked him. When she thought about him her heart \nfluttered and she couldn&rsquo;t stop smiling. But there was a gentle ache in \nher heart as well, reminding her that this vacation wouldn&rsquo;t be forever.\n As much as she and Kyouka had connected and kept in touch&hellip; a long \ndistance relationship was extremely difficult, and Momo was about to \nhead to university. She didn&rsquo;t need that sort of distraction.</p><p>&ldquo;I already told you I would only admit it, if <i>you</i> admit your crush on Kaminari-san!&rdquo; Momo continued, immediately changing the subject.</p><p>&ldquo;What?! This has nothing to do with me and him!&rdquo; Kyouka sputtered.</p><p>&ldquo;When are you two going to ski together?&rdquo; Momo teased.</p><p>&ldquo;Uh, excuse you, he snowboards, which is why we <i>won&rsquo;t</i> be 'skiing&rsquo; together,&rdquo; she said.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; Momo sighed dramatically. &ldquo;When are you going to hit the slopes together?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Uh, never,&rdquo; Kyouka snorted.</p><p>&ldquo;So\n you&rsquo;re ready to see him tonight then?&rdquo; Momo asked, humming as she began\n to button up the red sweater around her white tank top.</p><p>&ldquo;Whatever,&rdquo; Kyouka said, flopping back down onto the bed. &ldquo;Who knows if we&rsquo;ll even talk.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t he say he would see you there?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, Yaomomo, <i>seeing</i> something and actually <i>talking</i> to someone are two totally different things!&rdquo; Kyouka said, staring up at the ceiling.</p><p>&ldquo;Ah, right,&rdquo; Momo snorted, pulling her long dark hair up into a ponytail. &ldquo;How could I ever possibly forget?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, but you have to trust me on this one,&rdquo; Kyouka explained.</p><p>&ldquo;Right, you are the dating expert,&rdquo; Momo said, nodding at her friend.</p><p>&ldquo;Between the two of us, I really am,&rdquo; Kyouka said. She pushed herself up and stretched. &ldquo;We ready for dinner?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I\n don&rsquo;t understand why you&rsquo;re so hesitant to say you like Kaminari-san, \nyou&rsquo;ve never held back in the past,&rdquo; Momo asked, ignoring her question \nabout dinner.</p><p>&ldquo;I-I dunno!&rdquo; Kyouka hummed. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s&hellip; a nerd.&rdquo; She pursed her lips, and Momo could tell her friend knew it was a poor excuse.</p><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with nerds you know?&rdquo; she huffed.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re fine, but&hellip; I dunno&hellip; he&rsquo;s just not my normal type.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; Momo began, hooking her arm through Kyouka&rsquo;s, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s a good thing!&rdquo;</p><p>Kyouka sighed, grabbing her small bag. &ldquo;Who knows&hellip;&rdquo; She rolled her eyes and nudged Momo. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have fun regardless.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Of\n course!&rdquo; Momo smiled. As much as she knew that was true, deep down \nthere was a small part of her that hoped she would get a chance to see \nTodoroki there.</p>",

T-Though I \nsuppose it wouldn\u2019t be too difficult to find a rooftop deck.\u201d She \nlaughed at herself, though he could sense she seemed nervous. \u201cA-Anyway,\n I\u2019ll stop talking now so you can have some peace and quiet. I \nunderstand how sometimes a vacation doesn\u2019t feel like one unless you\u2026 \ntake some time to yourself.\u201d</p><p>A small smile pulled across his face. \u201cI don\u2019t mind talking to you, Yaoyorozu-san. You\u2019re very refreshing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA-Am I?!\u201d she squeaked, shock crossing her features.</p><p>\u201cTrust me,\u201d he muttered, leaning against the railing. \u201cYou\u2019re far better than dealing with my father at dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\n see\u2026\u201d she said softly. Her pale face was illuminated by the fairy \nlights which trailed around the deck. They twinkled against the snow, \nsome of them covered with the freezing white dust. The slopes before \nthem were mostly dark, minus two small trails still lit for those who \nchose to go night skiing. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but\u2026 I do understand,\u201d she \nadmitted. \u201cMy parents haven\u2019t been the best this year either.\u201d A sad \nlook crossed her eyes, and Shouto wanted to ask her more, but felt it \nwasn\u2019t his place.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2026 come here every year, correct?\u201d he asked, glancing towards her.</p><p>Immediately\n her face lit up. \u201cYes!\u201d she said, clapping her hands together. \u201cI know I\n mentioned it before, but this is my favorite place in the whole world.\u201d\n She smiled, glancing out at the mountain. \u201cThe air is fresh, the snow \nis beautiful, and I have so many wonderful memories here.\u201d</p><p>Shouto couldn\u2019t help but smile, the energy radiating off of her was contagious. \u201cMmm,\u201d he nodded. \u201cYou can tell you love it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\n glad! I hope whatever is going on with your family doesn\u2019t ruin this \nplace because it really is incredible,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m trying not to let\n my parents get to me too much.

Both our families \nalways come during winter break.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat so?\u201d he said, listening to her speak so excitedly about her favorite place.</p><p>\u201cMhm!\u201d\n she nodded. \u201cI love spending time with Kyouka-chan.\u201d She shut her eyes \nand pulled in a long breath of air. \u201cBut I also love being out on the \nmountain.\u201d</p><p>There was a time when he would\u2019ve probably agreed. \nThough he had never been to this lodge specifically, being out on the \nslopes and skiing through the snow was important to him. He could \nactually connect with his mother when he was out in the snow, it felt \nlike she was there, skiing right beside him.</p><p>But lately it was \nhard to feel nostalgic when his father was breathing down their necks, \nsetting a schedule for their vacation. Did he expect them to have fun? \nHe supposed that was probably what his father wanted, especially since \nhe was wanting to \u2018play games\u2019\u2026 though Shouto could only imagine what a\n disaster that would be.</p><p>\u201cI used to love that, but this trip has been\u2026 nothing but a headache,\u201d he sighed, leaning forward against the railing.</p><p>\u201cAh?\n I-I\u2019m sorry, Todoroki-san,\u201d Yaoyorozu said quickly. She bowed her head.\n \u201cI can keep quiet so you can have a peaceful moment!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he \nchuckled, laughing at how quick she was to be nervous. \u201cI already said I\n don\u2019t mind listening to you speak. Actually, hearing you talk so fondly\n of this place makes me\u2026 like it more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?!\u201d she said, her\n dark eyes shimmering with excitement. She reached forward and grabbed \nhis hands. \u201cIt really is amazing here. There\u2019s so much to do and the \nscenery is so calming and beautiful! And the food is also amazing. I-I \nmean you already ate at the best restaurant but-\u201d She paused, as if she \nsuddenly realized they were now holding hands. She jumped back a bit, \nrunning her gloved hands over the railing. \u201cS-Sorry, Todoroki-san\u2026 I \nget so excited and since things have been a little stressful\u2026 I was \nhappy to share fond memories!\u201d</p><p>Cute.</p><p>Oh gosh, was she cute. \nHe thought back to his father being so frustrated this girl could \npotentially be a distraction for him. Admittedly, Shouto had never \nthought too much about romance or girls\u2026 or any sort of relationships \nas he often kept to himself. He didn\u2019t have time to focus on other \npeople, not with the intense study schedule his father often prepared \nfor him.</p><p>But what if\u2026</p><p>What if, just this once, he allowed himself the distraction?</p><p>He\n watched her for a moment, her gaze staring at her hands, as if she was \nso embarrassed she had accidentally held his hand for a short period of \ntime.</p><p>\u201cPlease, Yaoyorozu-san, don\u2019t apologize. I like hearing you talk about\u2026 something you love.\u201d</p><p><i>'You look beautiful.\u2019</i>\n The words hung on the tip of his tongue. He barely knew her, and he \ncouldn\u2019t just blurt these things out. She would probably look at him \nlike he was some sort of creep.</p><p>\u201cO-Oh\u2026\u201d she said, and giggled. \n\u201cWell, what about you, Todoroki-san?\u201d she asked, leaning against the \nrailing. \u201cWhat is something you love?\u201d</p><p>He froze. Something he loved? What was\u2026 something he loved?</p><p>\u201cCold soba.\u201d</p><p>How\n lame. He mentally slapped his hand against his forehead. She was going \nto think he was some sort of idiot; he was certain she didn\u2019t mean what \nhis favorite food was.</p><p>\u201cCold\u2026 soba?\u201d she asked, tilting her \nhead. She giggled softly, the sound echoing on the winter wind. It \nwarmed him, even with the cool night air surrounding them.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2026\n ah\u2026 uhm\u2026 \u201d He turned away from her, not wanting her to see how his \ncheeks were currently as red as his left portion of hair.</p><p>\u201cSoba is quite tasty so, I understand!\u201d</p><p>She was just being nice.</p><p>\u201cSorry\u2026\u201d he mumbled. \u201cThat probably wasn\u2019t the answer you were expecting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAdmittedly, no!\u201d she laughed. \u201cBut it was\u2026 very endearing.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2026I suppose,\u201d he sighed. \u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 difficult for me to say what I really, truly love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\n can assure you, Todoroki-san,\u201d Yaoyorozu smiled. \u201cThis is a very safe \nspace.\u201d She placed her hand over her chest and stood up straight. \u201cI \nswear, anything you tell me will not leave this rooftop deck.\u201d</p><p>His eye widened as he watched her.</p><p>\n \u00a0<i>Cute!</i>\n</p><p>It made his chest clench a little. Was this what it meant to have a crush?</p><p>It was a foolish feeling, since he most likely wouldn\u2019t see her after this vacation was over\u2026 and yet\u2026</p><p>He didn\u2019t hate the way his heart fluttered when he looked at her.</p><p>He\n nodded his head at her. \u201cThank you, Yaoyorozu-san. It\u2019s not that I \ndon\u2019t trust you.\u201d In fact, there was something very appealing about \nspeaking to her. She didn\u2019t know him, had no bias towards him or his \npast or how he acted in school. However, he didn\u2019t want to make a \ncomplete fool of himself.</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m glad I seem trustworthy!\u201d she smiled.</p><p>\u201cMhm,\u201d he nodded. \u201cI suppose\u2026 it\u2019s hard for me to say it because I\u2019m not sure what I love.\u201d</p><p>Her\n brow furrowed, looking at him with such concern. There was a part of \nhim that regretted speaking up, because he much preferred when he was \nable to make her smile.</p><p>\u201cCan I ask what you mean?\u201d she said softly, her dark eyes waiting patiently for him to speak.</p><p>\u201cMy\n father,\u201d he began slowly, \u201che wants me to take over his company. He\u2019s a\n businessman. My whole life he\u2019s been pushing me. It\u2019s always been my \nonly purpose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour whole life?\u201d she asked, gently prodding for more information, though nothing about her tone or demeanor was pushy.</p><p>\u201cMmm\u2026\u201d\n he nodded. \u201cMy eldest brother was sickly as a child and deemed \nunworthy. He\u2019s studying abroad now to be a doctor. My sister, as a \nwoman, was not worthy to him\u2026 Natsuo, the brother you met, he is far \ntoo easily distractible and my father couldn\u2019t put up with it,\u201d he \nexplained. \u201cThen there was me, and I am being molded into his perfect \nlittle heir.\u201d There was a bite to his tone and he turned towards the \nrailing, staring at the snow pooled on top of it.</p><p>He swallowed, \nwondering if he had said too much. It wasn\u2019t like him to speak about his\n family so freely, but Yaoyorozu made him feel so comfortable.</p><p>\u201cTodoroki-san,\u201d\n she whispered, reaching over to place her gloved hand over his. \u201cI\u2019m so\n sorry. Is business something you\u2019re interested in?\u201d she asked. Her \nvoice was so genuine, and even through his glove, he could feel the \ngentle pressure and squeeze from her hand.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve \nnever been given the freedom to think about it,\u201d he admitted. He wasn\u2019t \nsure anyone had ever even asked him a question like that.</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d she whispered. \u201cAre there any\u2026 hobbies you have that you enjoy? Something you pull joy from?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d Shouto hummed softly. \u201cI enjoy this. Skiing, I mean. Or I used to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat changed?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Shouto\n froze, his heart suddenly throbbing in his ears. He knew exactly what \nchanged, but the words were trapped in his throat. He couldn\u2019t just say \nit, could he?</p><p>\n \u00a0<i>\u201cIt\u2019s your mother\u2026\u201d</i>\n</p><p>\n \u00a0<i>\u201cShe\u2026\u201d</i>\n</p><p>\u201cI\u2026\u201d He let out a soft breath, a heated cloud curling in the air in front of him. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he lied.</p><p>\u201cI\n see,\u201d she whispered. Maybe she could tell he wasn\u2019t giving her the full\n story, but she was far too polite to ask for any further details.</p><p>\u201cWhat\n about you,\u201d he asked, changing the subject. Dwelling on his mother was \nnever good for his mental state, and so far the majority of this trip \nhad brought back nostalgic memories which made his heart ache. He didn\u2019t\n want to think about it, not when he was spending time with her. He had \ntalked about himself far too much already.</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d she gasped. \u201cI-I\u2026 admittedly after hearing your story I feel a little foolish,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Please Yaoyorozu-san, that wasn\u2019t my intention,\u201d he urged.</p><p>\u201cI-I\n know!\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s silly. My parents keep pressuring me to decide \nwhat I want to do with my future. I\u2019ve been accepted to the university I\n wanted and unlike you, my father doesn\u2019t mind if I take a different \npath with my life\u2026 however, I know he wants me in a stable position. \nYou should\u2019ve heard him tonight,\u201d she laughed sadly. \u201cKyouka is a \nmusician and he was <i>very</i> concerned I planned on following her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, parents,\u201d Shouto sighed.</p><p>\u201cRight?\u201d\n she said, sighing along with him. \u201cI actually really enjoy chemistry, \nbut I have no idea if my father would approve. I don\u2019t know where \nexactly I can go and be a chemist. Maybe I could teach\u2026\u201d she babbled, \nnervously stroking the end of her hair between her gloved fingers. \u201cIt\u2019s\n overwhelming, to think about and consider your future. I was hoping \nthis trip would be a nice break from it all, but almost every dinner my \nfather brings it up.\u201d</p><p>They had opposite problems. Shouto was being\n forced into a set future, one he couldn\u2019t change, and Yaoyorozu was \nspiraling along an uncertain path, one she couldn\u2019t decide upon.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve\n mentioned it to Kyouka, but her family is so relaxed and supportive of \nher music, she tends to not understand why I don\u2019t just choose what I \nwant,\u201d she continued. \u201cWhile that\u2019s nice to think about, I worry my \nfather won\u2019t approve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand,\u201d he nodded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s not pleasant to hear about my horribly wishy-washy decisions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, pressure, regardless of what form, is never pleasant,\u201d he muttered. He knew this quite well.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Todoroki-san,\u201d she said, bowing to him. \u201cI appreciate you taking the time to listen to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell\n thank you for doing the same,\u201d he chuckled, nodding. He did feel a bit \nguilty for speaking to her so much, but at the same time\u2026 she had been\n so open with him too. In a strange way, he felt she understood him.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps we could\u2026 speak up here again sometime in the next week and a half,\u201d she said, a smile pulling across her features.</p><p>He would\u2019ve spoken to her up here every night if he could.</p><p>\u201cI would like that. You\u2019re right, it is very peaceful and calm up here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMhm,\u201d she said and placed her finger against her lips. \u201cIt\u2019s a secret! But I\u2019m happy to share it with you.\u201d</p><p>He bowed his head to her and chuckled. \u201cI feel quite honored to know about it then.\u201d</p><p>She\n nodded and reluctantly pulled her hand away from his, realizing she \nstill had it resting over his. \u201cI-I do wish you could come to the party \ntomorrow night, but I understand your father is quite intense!\u201d she \nsighed.</p><p>He clenched his hands around the railing. He wanted more \nthan anything to come to the party and spend more time with her. \n\u201cI\u2019ll\u2026 make it,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll figure out a way to get away from him \nand-\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh! Please don\u2019t get in trouble, Todoroki-san!\u201d she said, her eyes shimmering with nervousness.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d he chuckled.</p><p>The\n two of them stayed on the roof for a bit longer, letting the night \nslowly wear on. For now they were free from their burdens, their \nfamilies slept soundly while they spoke into the night, and Shouto knew \nhe had to get to that party, no matter what.</p><p>~~</p><p>\u201cSomeone\u2019s \nglowing,\u201d Kyouka said, flopping onto Momo\u2019s bed. The two met up after \nskiing and showering the next day. The party was only a few hours away \nand the two girls had plans to get dinner and head over to the pool.</p><p>\u201cGlowing?!\u201d she gasped and slid the closet door open, searching through the clothes she hung up. \u201cI-I don\u2019t know about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you been texting with Todoroki?\u201d she teased.</p><p>\u201cWell\u2026\u201d\n she cleared her throat. \u201cWe actually spent some time together on the \nroof.\u201d She braced herself, ready for the reaction from her friend.</p><p>\u201c<i>What?!</i> Yaoyorozu Momo, taking a <i>boy</i> up to her very special spot?!\u201d Kyouka gasped, clutching her hand against her chest as she leaned forward on the bed.</p><p>\u201cK-Kyouka!\n It wasn\u2019t a big deal. He was having a difficult time with his father \nand so I invited him up for some peace and quiet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, sure,\u201d \nshe nodded, folding her arms over her chest. \u201cPeace and quiet, and then \nyou proceeded to talk his ear off I assume.\u201d</p><p>Momo popped her head out of the closet, her cheeks bright red. \u201cOh gosh\u2026 I probably did talk too much!\u201d</p><p>Kyouka scoffed. \u201cI doubt you did, I was just making a joke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cR-Right\u2026\u201d\n Momo sighed. \u201cI don\u2019t know it was\u2026 pleasant. I think we sort of \nunderstood each other even though our problems are <i>very</i> \ndifferent.\u201d She smiled, glancing towards her window as she pulled a \nsweater off of the hanger. \u201cAnd he did say he was going to try and make \nit to the party tonight.\u201d She hummed, clutching the sweater to her chest\n as she rocked back and forth happily.</p><p>\u201cGreat. So are you ready to admit this crush you have on him?\u201d Kyouka smirked, raising her eyebrow at her best friend.</p><p>\u201cHuh?!\u201d\n She froze. Admittedly, she had an amazing time on the roof last night. \nBesides Kyouka, she couldn\u2019t remember ever connecting with someone that \nfast. They spoke for so long and Todoroki admitted his love of soba \nnoodles and his frustrations with his family. She too, had admitted her \nown frustrations, though hearing his did make her feel a little guilty.</p><p>She\n wanted to say she liked him. When she thought about him her heart \nfluttered and she couldn\u2019t stop smiling. But there was a gentle ache in \nher heart as well, reminding her that this vacation wouldn\u2019t be forever.\n As much as she and Kyouka had connected and kept in touch\u2026 a long \ndistance relationship was extremely difficult, and Momo was about to \nhead to university. She didn\u2019t need that sort of distraction.</p><p>\u201cI already told you I would only admit it, if <i>you</i> admit your crush on Kaminari-san!\u201d Momo continued, immediately changing the subject.</p><p>\u201cWhat?! This has nothing to do with me and him!\u201d Kyouka sputtered.</p><p>\u201cWhen are you two going to ski together?\u201d Momo teased.</p><p>\u201cUh, excuse you, he snowboards, which is why we <i>won\u2019t</i> be 'skiing\u2019 together,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Momo sighed dramatically. \u201cWhen are you going to hit the slopes together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, never,\u201d Kyouka snorted.</p><p>\u201cSo\n you\u2019re ready to see him tonight then?\u201d Momo asked, humming as she began\n to button up the red sweater around her white tank top.</p><p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d Kyouka said, flopping back down onto the bed. \u201cWho knows if we\u2019ll even talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t he say he would see you there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, Yaomomo, <i>seeing</i> something and actually <i>talking</i> to someone are two totally different things!\u201d Kyouka said, staring up at the ceiling.</p><p>\u201cAh, right,\u201d Momo snorted, pulling her long dark hair up into a ponytail. \u201cHow could I ever possibly forget?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, but you have to trust me on this one,\u201d Kyouka explained.</p><p>\u201cRight, you are the dating expert,\u201d Momo said, nodding at her friend.</p><p>\u201cBetween the two of us, I really am,\u201d Kyouka said. She pushed herself up and stretched. \u201cWe ready for dinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\n don\u2019t understand why you\u2019re so hesitant to say you like Kaminari-san, \nyou\u2019ve never held back in the past,\u201d Momo asked, ignoring her question \nabout dinner.</p><p>\u201cI-I dunno!\u201d Kyouka hummed. \u201cHe\u2019s\u2026 a nerd.\u201d She pursed her lips, and Momo could tell her friend knew it was a poor excuse.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with nerds you know?\u201d she huffed.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re fine, but\u2026 I dunno\u2026 he\u2019s just not my normal type.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d Momo began, hooking her arm through Kyouka\u2019s, \u201cthat\u2019s a good thing!\u201d</p><p>Kyouka sighed, grabbing her small bag. \u201cWho knows\u2026\u201d She rolled her eyes and nudged Momo. \u201cWe\u2019ll have fun regardless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf\n course!\u201d Momo smiled. As much as she knew that was true, deep down \nthere was a small part of her that hoped she would get a chance to see \nTodoroki there.</p>",

Even with his siblings there, everything reminds him of his \npast and he just wants to get back to finishing school and moving on.<br>When\n the two continuously run into each other at the lodge, both of them \nrealize their vacations aren\u2019t going to be what either of them expected.<br><br><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/16851022/chapters/42550637\">Read on AO3</a><br><br>Thanks to <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m9Z3xF4a7jao2Xy-1acpZzw\">@its-love-u-asshole</a> for reading this! <br></small></p><p><small>Climbing the stairs to the top of the lodge building, Shouto was \nthrilled to be getting some time to himself. Just as Yaoyorozu had \npointed out, there was a large rooftop deck, completely empty minus her.\n Currently she was leaning over the railing, her long dark hair \nfluttering in the cool night air. She hadn\u2019t been kidding when she \ncasually mentioned it was cold. Cold was\u2026 an understatement.</small></p><p><small>Zipping\n up his jacket, Shouto let the door shut behind him. Immediately \nYaoyorozu turned around and waved, smiling at him. He nuzzled his nose \nagainst the collar of his coat and walked towards the edge of the deck \nwhere she stood.</small></p><p><small>There was something about her Shouto couldn\u2019t \nquite place. He didn\u2019t know this girl at all, and yet he felt drawn to \nher. She was beautiful, probably one of the most beautiful girls he had \never encountered, but it wasn\u2019t her beauty which drew him in. She seemed\n genuine, kind and easily excited, but still poised, classy, and well \nput together. He found himself impressed by her.</small></p>[[MORE]]<p>It was why his feet kept walking towards her even now.</p><p>\u201cAh! \nTodoroki-san!\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m glad you were able to find it. T-Though I \nsuppose it wouldn\u2019t be too difficult to find a rooftop deck.\u201d She \nlaughed at herself, though he could sense she seemed nervous. \u201cA-Anyway,\n I\u2019ll stop talking now so you can have some peace and quiet. I \nunderstand how sometimes a vacation doesn\u2019t feel like one unless you\u2026 \ntake some time to yourself.\u201d</p><p>A small smile pulled across his face. \u201cI don\u2019t mind talking to you, Yaoyorozu-san. You\u2019re very refreshing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA-Am I?!\u201d she squeaked, shock crossing her features.</p><p>\u201cTrust me,\u201d he muttered, leaning against the railing. \u201cYou\u2019re far better than dealing with my father at dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\n see\u2026\u201d she said softly. Her pale face was illuminated by the fairy \nlights which trailed around the deck. They twinkled against the snow, \nsome of them covered with the freezing white dust. The slopes before \nthem were mostly dark, minus two small trails still lit for those who \nchose to go night skiing. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but\u2026 I do understand,\u201d she \nadmitted. \u201cMy parents haven\u2019t been the best this year either.\u201d A sad \nlook crossed her eyes, and Shouto wanted to ask her more, but felt it \nwasn\u2019t his place.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2026 come here every year, correct?\u201d he asked, glancing towards her.</p><p>Immediately\n her face lit up. \u201cYes!\u201d she said, clapping her hands together. \u201cI know I\n mentioned it before, but this is my favorite place in the whole world.\u201d\n She smiled, glancing out at the mountain. \u201cThe air is fresh, the snow \nis beautiful, and I have so many wonderful memories here.\u201d</p><p>Shouto couldn\u2019t help but smile, the energy radiating off of her was contagious. \u201cMmm,\u201d he nodded. \u201cYou can tell you love it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\n glad! I hope whatever is going on with your family doesn\u2019t ruin this \nplace because it really is incredible,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m trying not to let\n my parents get to me too much. Thankfully, Kyouka-chan is here. We met \nhere actually, and we\u2019ve been friends ever since. Both our families \nalways come during winter break.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat so?\u201d he said, listening to her speak so excitedly about her favorite place.</p><p>\u201cMhm!\u201d\n she nodded. \u201cI love spending time with Kyouka-chan.\u201d She shut her eyes \nand pulled in a long breath of air. \u201cBut I also love being out on the \nmountain.\u201d</p><p>There was a time when he would\u2019ve probably agreed. \nThough he had never been to this lodge specifically, being out on the \nslopes and skiing through the snow was important to him. He could \nactually connect with his mother when he was out in the snow, it felt \nlike she was there, skiing right beside him.</p><p>But lately it was \nhard to feel nostalgic when his father was breathing down their necks, \nsetting a schedule for their vacation. Did he expect them to have fun? \nHe supposed that was probably what his father wanted, especially since \nhe was wanting to \u2018play games\u2019\u2026 though Shouto could only imagine what a\n disaster that would be.</p><p>\u201cI used to love that, but this trip has been\u2026 nothing but a headache,\u201d he sighed, leaning forward against the railing.</p><p>\u201cAh?\n I-I\u2019m sorry, Todoroki-san,\u201d Yaoyorozu said quickly. She bowed her head.\n \u201cI can keep quiet so you can have a peaceful moment!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he \nchuckled, laughing at how quick she was to be nervous. \u201cI already said I\n don\u2019t mind listening to you speak. Actually, hearing you talk so fondly\n of this place makes me\u2026 like it more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?!\u201d she said, her\n dark eyes shimmering with excitement. She reached forward and grabbed \nhis hands. \u201cIt really is amazing here. There\u2019s so much to do and the \nscenery is so calming and beautiful! And the food is also amazing. I-I \nmean you already ate at the best restaurant but-\u201d She paused, as if she \nsuddenly realized they were now holding hands. She jumped back a bit, \nrunning her gloved hands over the railing. \u201cS-Sorry, Todoroki-san\u2026 I \nget so excited and since things have been a little stressful\u2026 I was \nhappy to share fond memories!\u201d</p><p>Cute.</p><p>Oh gosh, was she cute. \nHe thought back to his father being so frustrated this girl could \npotentially be a distraction for him. Admittedly, Shouto had never \nthought too much about romance or girls\u2026 or any sort of relationships \nas he often kept to himself. He didn\u2019t have time to focus on other \npeople, not with the intense study schedule his father often prepared \nfor him.</p><p>But what if\u2026</p><p>What if, just this once, he allowed himself the distraction?</p><p>He\n watched her for a moment, her gaze staring at her hands, as if she was \nso embarrassed she had accidentally held his hand for a short period of \ntime.</p><p>\u201cPlease, Yaoyorozu-san, don\u2019t apologize. I like hearing you talk about\u2026 something you love.\u201d</p><p><i>'You look beautiful.\u2019</i>\n The words hung on the tip of his tongue. He barely knew her, and he \ncouldn\u2019t just blurt these things out. She would probably look at him \nlike he was some sort of creep.</p><p>\u201cO-Oh\u2026\u201d she said, and giggled. \n\u201cWell, what about you, Todoroki-san?\u201d she asked, leaning against the \nrailing. \u201cWhat is something you love?\u201d</p><p>He froze. Something he loved? What was\u2026 something he loved?</p><p>\u201cCold soba.\u201d</p><p>How\n lame. He mentally slapped his hand against his forehead. She was going \nto think he was some sort of idiot; he was certain she didn\u2019t mean what \nhis favorite food was.</p><p>\u201cCold\u2026 soba?\u201d she asked, tilting her \nhead. She giggled softly, the sound echoing on the winter wind. It \nwarmed him, even with the cool night air surrounding them.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2026\n ah\u2026 uhm\u2026 \u201d He turned away from her, not wanting her to see how his \ncheeks were currently as red as his left portion of hair.</p><p>\u201cSoba is quite tasty so, I understand!\u201d</p><p>She was just being nice.</p><p>\u201cSorry\u2026\u201d he mumbled. \u201cThat probably wasn\u2019t the answer you were expecting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAdmittedly, no!\u201d she laughed. \u201cBut it was\u2026 very endearing.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2026I suppose,\u201d he sighed. \u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 difficult for me to say what I really, truly love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\n can assure you, Todoroki-san,\u201d Yaoyorozu smiled. \u201cThis is a very safe \nspace.\u201d She placed her hand over her chest and stood up straight. \u201cI \nswear, anything you tell me will not leave this rooftop deck.\u201d</p><p>His eye widened as he watched her.</p><p>\n \u00a0<i>Cute!</i>\n</p><p>It made his chest clench a little. Was this what it meant to have a crush?</p><p>It was a foolish feeling, since he most likely wouldn\u2019t see her after this vacation was over\u2026 and yet\u2026</p><p>He didn\u2019t hate the way his heart fluttered when he looked at her.</p><p>He\n nodded his head at her. \u201cThank you, Yaoyorozu-san. It\u2019s not that I \ndon\u2019t trust you.\u201d In fact, there was something very appealing about \nspeaking to her. She didn\u2019t know him, had no bias towards him or his \npast or how he acted in school. However, he didn\u2019t want to make a \ncomplete fool of himself.</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m glad I seem trustworthy!\u201d she smiled.</p><p>\u201cMhm,\u201d he nodded. \u201cI suppose\u2026 it\u2019s hard for me to say it because I\u2019m not sure what I love.\u201d</p><p>Her\n brow furrowed, looking at him with such concern. There was a part of \nhim that regretted speaking up, because he much preferred when he was \nable to make her smile.</p><p>\u201cCan I ask what you mean?\u201d she said softly, her dark eyes waiting patiently for him to speak.</p><p>\u201cMy\n father,\u201d he began slowly, \u201che wants me to take over his company. He\u2019s a\n businessman. My whole life he\u2019s been pushing me. It\u2019s always been my \nonly purpose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour whole life?\u201d she asked, gently prodding for more information, though nothing about her tone or demeanor was pushy.</p><p>\u201cMmm\u2026\u201d\n he nodded. \u201cMy eldest brother was sickly as a child and deemed \nunworthy. He\u2019s studying abroad now to be a doctor. My sister, as a \nwoman, was not worthy to him\u2026 Natsuo, the brother you met, he is far \ntoo easily distractible and my father couldn\u2019t put up with it,\u201d he \nexplained. \u201cThen there was me, and I am being molded into his perfect \nlittle heir.\u201d There was a bite to his tone and he turned towards the \nrailing, staring at the snow pooled on top of it.</p><p>He swallowed, \nwondering if he had said too much. It wasn\u2019t like him to speak about his\n family so freely, but Yaoyorozu made him feel so comfortable.</p><p>\u201cTodoroki-san,\u201d\n she whispered, reaching over to place her gloved hand over his. \u201cI\u2019m so\n sorry. Is business something you\u2019re interested in?\u201d she asked. Her \nvoice was so genuine, and even through his glove, he could feel the \ngentle pressure and squeeze from her hand.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve \nnever been given the freedom to think about it,\u201d he admitted. He wasn\u2019t \nsure anyone had ever even asked him a question like that.</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d she whispered. \u201cAre there any\u2026 hobbies you have that you enjoy? Something you pull joy from?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d Shouto hummed softly. \u201cI enjoy this. Skiing, I mean. Or I used to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat changed?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Shouto\n froze, his heart suddenly throbbing in his ears. He knew exactly what \nchanged, but the words were trapped in his throat. He couldn\u2019t just say \nit, could he?</p><p>\n \u00a0<i>\u201cIt\u2019s your mother\u2026\u201d</i>\n</p><p>\n \u00a0<i>\u201cShe\u2026\u201d</i>\n</p><p>\u201cI\u2026\u201d He let out a soft breath, a heated cloud curling in the air in front of him. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he lied.</p><p>\u201cI\n see,\u201d she whispered. Maybe she could tell he wasn\u2019t giving her the full\n story, but she was far too polite to ask for any further details.</p><p>\u201cWhat\n about you,\u201d he asked, changing the subject. Dwelling on his mother was \nnever good for his mental state, and so far the majority of this trip \nhad brought back nostalgic memories which made his heart ache. He didn\u2019t\n want to think about it, not when he was spending time with her. He had \ntalked about himself far too much already.</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d she gasped. \u201cI-I\u2026 admittedly after hearing your story I feel a little foolish,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Please Yaoyorozu-san, that wasn\u2019t my intention,\u201d he urged.</p><p>\u201cI-I\n know!\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s silly. My parents keep pressuring me to decide \nwhat I want to do with my future. I\u2019ve been accepted to the university I\n wanted and unlike you, my father doesn\u2019t mind if I take a different \npath with my life\u2026 however, I know he wants me in a stable position. \nYou should\u2019ve heard him tonight,\u201d she laughed sadly. \u201cKyouka is a \nmusician and he was <i>very</i> concerned I planned on following her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, parents,\u201d Shouto sighed.</p><p>\u201cRight?\u201d\n she said, sighing along with him. \u201cI actually really enjoy chemistry, \nbut I have no idea if my father would approve. I don\u2019t know where \nexactly I can go and be a chemist. Maybe I could teach\u2026\u201d she babbled, \nnervously stroking the end of her hair between her gloved fingers. \u201cIt\u2019s\n overwhelming, to think about and consider your future. I was hoping \nthis trip would be a nice break from it all, but almost every dinner my \nfather brings it up.\u201d</p><p>They had opposite problems. Shouto was being\n forced into a set future, one he couldn\u2019t change, and Yaoyorozu was \nspiraling along an uncertain path, one she couldn\u2019t decide upon.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve\n mentioned it to Kyouka, but her family is so relaxed and supportive of \nher music, she tends to not understand why I don\u2019t just choose what I \nwant,\u201d she continued. \u201cWhile that\u2019s nice to think about, I worry my \nfather won\u2019t approve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand,\u201d he nodded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s not pleasant to hear about my horribly wishy-washy decisions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, pressure, regardless of what form, is never pleasant,\u201d he muttered. He knew this quite well.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Todoroki-san,\u201d she said, bowing to him. \u201cI appreciate you taking the time to listen to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell\n thank you for doing the same,\u201d he chuckled, nodding. He did feel a bit \nguilty for speaking to her so much, but at the same time\u2026 she had been\n so open with him too. In a strange way, he felt she understood him.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps we could\u2026 speak up here again sometime in the next week and a half,\u201d she said, a smile pulling across her features.</p><p>He would\u2019ve spoken to her up here every night if he could.</p><p>\u201cI would like that. You\u2019re right, it is very peaceful and calm up here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMhm,\u201d she said and placed her finger against her lips. \u201cIt\u2019s a secret! But I\u2019m happy to share it with you.\u201d</p><p>He bowed his head to her and chuckled. \u201cI feel quite honored to know about it then.\u201d</p><p>She\n nodded and reluctantly pulled her hand away from his, realizing she \nstill had it resting over his. \u201cI-I do wish you could come to the party \ntomorrow night, but I understand your father is quite intense!\u201d she \nsighed.</p><p>He clenched his hands around the railing. He wanted more \nthan anything to come to the party and spend more time with her. \n\u201cI\u2019ll\u2026 make it,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll figure out a way to get away from him \nand-\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh! Please don\u2019t get in trouble, Todoroki-san!\u201d she said, her eyes shimmering with nervousness.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d he chuckled.</p><p>The\n two of them stayed on the roof for a bit longer, letting the night \nslowly wear on. For now they were free from their burdens, their \nfamilies slept soundly while they spoke into the night, and Shouto knew \nhe had to get to that party, no matter what.</p><p>~~</p><p>\u201cSomeone\u2019s \nglowing,\u201d Kyouka said, flopping onto Momo\u2019s bed. The two met up after \nskiing and showering the next day. The party was only a few hours away \nand the two girls had plans to get dinner and head over to the pool.</p><p>\u201cGlowing?!\u201d she gasped and slid the closet door open, searching through the clothes she hung up. \u201cI-I don\u2019t know about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you been texting with Todoroki?\u201d she teased.</p><p>\u201cWell\u2026\u201d\n she cleared her throat. \u201cWe actually spent some time together on the \nroof.\u201d She braced herself, ready for the reaction from her friend.</p><p>\u201c<i>What?!</i> Yaoyorozu Momo, taking a <i>boy</i> up to her very special spot?!\u201d Kyouka gasped, clutching her hand against her chest as she leaned forward on the bed.</p><p>\u201cK-Kyouka!\n It wasn\u2019t a big deal. He was having a difficult time with his father \nand so I invited him up for some peace and quiet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, sure,\u201d \nshe nodded, folding her arms over her chest. \u201cPeace and quiet, and then \nyou proceeded to talk his ear off I assume.\u201d</p><p>Momo popped her head out of the closet, her cheeks bright red. \u201cOh gosh\u2026 I probably did talk too much!\u201d</p><p>Kyouka scoffed. \u201cI doubt you did, I was just making a joke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cR-Right\u2026\u201d\n Momo sighed. \u201cI don\u2019t know it was\u2026 pleasant. I think we sort of \nunderstood each other even though our problems are <i>very</i> \ndifferent.\u201d She smiled, glancing towards her window as she pulled a \nsweater off of the hanger. \u201cAnd he did say he was going to try and make \nit to the party tonight.\u201d She hummed, clutching the sweater to her chest\n as she rocked back and forth happily.</p><p>\u201cGreat. So are you ready to admit this crush you have on him?\u201d Kyouka smirked, raising her eyebrow at her best friend.</p><p>\u201cHuh?!\u201d\n She froze. Admittedly, she had an amazing time on the roof last night. \nBesides Kyouka, she couldn\u2019t remember ever connecting with someone that \nfast. They spoke for so long and Todoroki admitted his love of soba \nnoodles and his frustrations with his family. She too, had admitted her \nown frustrations, though hearing his did make her feel a little guilty.</p><p>She\n wanted to say she liked him. When she thought about him her heart \nfluttered and she couldn\u2019t stop smiling. But there was a gentle ache in \nher heart as well, reminding her that this vacation wouldn\u2019t be forever.\n As much as she and Kyouka had connected and kept in touch\u2026 a long \ndistance relationship was extremely difficult, and Momo was about to \nhead to university. She didn\u2019t need that sort of distraction.</p><p>\u201cI already told you I would only admit it, if <i>you</i> admit your crush on Kaminari-san!\u201d Momo continued, immediately changing the subject.</p><p>\u201cWhat?! This has nothing to do with me and him!\u201d Kyouka sputtered.</p><p>\u201cWhen are you two going to ski together?\u201d Momo teased.</p><p>\u201cUh, excuse you, he snowboards, which is why we <i>won\u2019t</i> be 'skiing\u2019 together,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Momo sighed dramatically. \u201cWhen are you going to hit the slopes together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, never,\u201d Kyouka snorted.</p><p>\u201cSo\n you\u2019re ready to see him tonight then?\u201d Momo asked, humming as she began\n to button up the red sweater around her white tank top.</p><p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d Kyouka said, flopping back down onto the bed. \u201cWho knows if we\u2019ll even talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t he say he would see you there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, Yaomomo, <i>seeing</i> something and actually <i>talking</i> to someone are two totally different things!\u201d Kyouka said, staring up at the ceiling.</p><p>\u201cAh, right,\u201d Momo snorted, pulling her long dark hair up into a ponytail. \u201cHow could I ever possibly forget?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, but you have to trust me on this one,\u201d Kyouka explained.</p><p>\u201cRight, you are the dating expert,\u201d Momo said, nodding at her friend.</p><p>\u201cBetween the two of us, I really am,\u201d Kyouka said. She pushed herself up and stretched. \u201cWe ready for dinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\n don\u2019t understand why you\u2019re so hesitant to say you like Kaminari-san, \nyou\u2019ve never held back in the past,\u201d Momo asked, ignoring her question \nabout dinner.</p><p>\u201cI-I dunno!\u201d Kyouka hummed. \u201cHe\u2019s\u2026 a nerd.\u201d She pursed her lips, and Momo could tell her friend knew it was a poor excuse.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with nerds you know?\u201d she huffed.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re fine, but\u2026 I dunno\u2026 he\u2019s just not my normal type.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d Momo began, hooking her arm through Kyouka\u2019s, \u201cthat\u2019s a good thing!\u201d</p><p>Kyouka sighed, grabbing her small bag. \u201cWho knows\u2026\u201d She rolled her eyes and nudged Momo. \u201cWe\u2019ll have fun regardless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf\n course!\u201d Momo smiled. As much as she knew that was true, deep down \nthere was a small part of her that hoped she would get a chance to see \nTodoroki there.</p>",

Even with his siblings there, everything reminds him of his \npast and he just wants to get back to finishing school and moving on.<br />When\n the two continuously run into each other at the lodge, both of them \nrealize their vacations aren&rsquo;t going to be what either of them expected.<br /><br /><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/16851022/chapters/42550637\">Read on AO3</a><br /><br />Thanks to <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m9Z3xF4a7jao2Xy-1acpZzw\">@its-love-u-asshole</a> for reading this! <br /></small></p><p><small>Climbing the stairs to the top of the lodge building, Shouto was \nthrilled to be getting some time to himself. Just as Yaoyorozu had \npointed out, there was a large rooftop deck, completely empty minus her.\n Currently she was leaning over the railing, her long dark hair \nfluttering in the cool night air. She hadn&rsquo;t been kidding when she \ncasually mentioned it was cold. Cold was&hellip; an understatement.</small></p><p><small>Zipping\n up his jacket, Shouto let the door shut behind him. Immediately \nYaoyorozu turned around and waved, smiling at him. He nuzzled his nose \nagainst the collar of his coat and walked towards the edge of the deck \nwhere she stood.</small></p><p><small>There was something about her Shouto couldn&rsquo;t \nquite place. He didn&rsquo;t know this girl at all, and yet he felt drawn to \nher. She was beautiful, probably one of the most beautiful girls he had \never encountered, but it wasn&rsquo;t her beauty which drew him in. She seemed\n genuine, kind and easily excited, but still poised, classy, and well \nput together. He found himself impressed by her.</small></p><p>It was why his feet kept walking towards her even now.</p><p>&ldquo;Ah! \nTodoroki-san!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you were able to find it. T-Though I \nsuppose it wouldn&rsquo;t be too difficult to find a rooftop deck.&rdquo; She \nlaughed at herself, though he could sense she seemed nervous. &ldquo;A-Anyway,\n I&rsquo;ll stop talking now so you can have some peace and quiet. I \nunderstand how sometimes a vacation doesn&rsquo;t feel like one unless you&hellip; \ntake some time to yourself.&rdquo;</p><p>A small smile pulled across his face. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind talking to you, Yaoyorozu-san. You&rsquo;re very refreshing.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A-Am I?!&rdquo; she squeaked, shock crossing her features.</p><p>&ldquo;Trust me,&rdquo; he muttered, leaning against the railing. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re far better than dealing with my father at dinner.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I\n see&hellip;&rdquo; she said softly. Her pale face was illuminated by the fairy \nlights which trailed around the deck. They twinkled against the snow, \nsome of them covered with the freezing white dust. The slopes before \nthem were mostly dark, minus two small trails still lit for those who \nchose to go night skiing. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, but&hellip; I do understand,&rdquo; she \nadmitted. &ldquo;My parents haven&rsquo;t been the best this year either.&rdquo; A sad \nlook crossed her eyes, and Shouto wanted to ask her more, but felt it \nwasn&rsquo;t his place.</p><p>&ldquo;You&hellip; come here every year, correct?&rdquo; he asked, glancing towards her.</p><p>Immediately\n her face lit up. &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; she said, clapping her hands together. &ldquo;I know I\n mentioned it before, but this is my favorite place in the whole world.&rdquo;\n She smiled, glancing out at the mountain. &ldquo;The air is fresh, the snow \nis beautiful, and I have so many wonderful memories here.&rdquo;</p><p>Shouto couldn&rsquo;t help but smile, the energy radiating off of her was contagious. &ldquo;Mmm,&rdquo; he nodded. &ldquo;You can tell you love it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m\n glad! I hope whatever is going on with your family doesn&rsquo;t ruin this \nplace because it really is incredible,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m trying not to let\n my parents get to me too much. Thankfully, Kyouka-chan is here. We met \nhere actually, and we&rsquo;ve been friends ever since. Both our families \nalways come during winter break.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That so?&rdquo; he said, listening to her speak so excitedly about her favorite place.</p><p>&ldquo;Mhm!&rdquo;\n she nodded. &ldquo;I love spending time with Kyouka-chan.&rdquo; She shut her eyes \nand pulled in a long breath of air. &ldquo;But I also love being out on the \nmountain.&rdquo;</p><p>There was a time when he would&rsquo;ve probably agreed. \nThough he had never been to this lodge specifically, being out on the \nslopes and skiing through the snow was important to him. He could \nactually connect with his mother when he was out in the snow, it felt \nlike she was there, skiing right beside him.</p><p>But lately it was \nhard to feel nostalgic when his father was breathing down their necks, \nsetting a schedule for their vacation. Did he expect them to have fun? \nHe supposed that was probably what his father wanted, especially since \nhe was wanting to &lsquo;play games&rsquo;&hellip; though Shouto could only imagine what a\n disaster that would be.</p><p>&ldquo;I used to love that, but this trip has been&hellip; nothing but a headache,&rdquo; he sighed, leaning forward against the railing.</p><p>&ldquo;Ah?\n I-I&rsquo;m sorry, Todoroki-san,&rdquo; Yaoyorozu said quickly. She bowed her head.\n &ldquo;I can keep quiet so you can have a peaceful moment!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he \nchuckled, laughing at how quick she was to be nervous. &ldquo;I already said I\n don&rsquo;t mind listening to you speak. Actually, hearing you talk so fondly\n of this place makes me&hellip; like it more.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Really?!&rdquo; she said, her\n dark eyes shimmering with excitement. She reached forward and grabbed \nhis hands. &ldquo;It really is amazing here. There&rsquo;s so much to do and the \nscenery is so calming and beautiful! And the food is also amazing. I-I \nmean you already ate at the best restaurant but-&rdquo; She paused, as if she \nsuddenly realized they were now holding hands. She jumped back a bit, \nrunning her gloved hands over the railing. &ldquo;S-Sorry, Todoroki-san&hellip; I \nget so excited and since things have been a little stressful&hellip; I was \nhappy to share fond memories!&rdquo;</p><p>Cute.</p><p>Oh gosh, was she cute. \nHe thought back to his father being so frustrated this girl could \npotentially be a distraction for him. Admittedly, Shouto had never \nthought too much about romance or girls&hellip; or any sort of relationships \nas he often kept to himself. He didn&rsquo;t have time to focus on other \npeople, not with the intense study schedule his father often prepared \nfor him.</p><p>But what if&hellip;</p><p>What if, just this once, he allowed himself the distraction?</p><p>He\n watched her for a moment, her gaze staring at her hands, as if she was \nso embarrassed she had accidentally held his hand for a short period of \ntime.</p><p>&ldquo;Please, Yaoyorozu-san, don&rsquo;t apologize. I like hearing you talk about&hellip; something you love.&rdquo;</p><p><i>'You look beautiful.&rsquo;</i>\n The words hung on the tip of his tongue. He barely knew her, and he \ncouldn&rsquo;t just blurt these things out. She would probably look at him \nlike he was some sort of creep.</p><p>&ldquo;O-Oh&hellip;&rdquo; she said, and giggled. \n&ldquo;Well, what about you, Todoroki-san?&rdquo; she asked, leaning against the \nrailing. &ldquo;What is something you love?&rdquo;</p><p>He froze. Something he loved? What was&hellip; something he loved?</p><p>&ldquo;Cold soba.&rdquo;</p><p>How\n lame. He mentally slapped his hand against his forehead. She was going \nto think he was some sort of idiot; he was certain she didn&rsquo;t mean what \nhis favorite food was.</p><p>&ldquo;Cold&hellip; soba?&rdquo; she asked, tilting her \nhead. She giggled softly, the sound echoing on the winter wind. It \nwarmed him, even with the cool night air surrounding them.</p><p>&ldquo;That&hellip;\n ah&hellip; uhm&hellip; &rdquo; He turned away from her, not wanting her to see how his \ncheeks were currently as red as his left portion of hair.</p><p>&ldquo;Soba is quite tasty so, I understand!&rdquo;</p><p>She was just being nice.</p><p>&ldquo;Sorry&hellip;&rdquo; he mumbled. &ldquo;That probably wasn&rsquo;t the answer you were expecting.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Admittedly, no!&rdquo; she laughed. &ldquo;But it was&hellip; very endearing.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;&hellip;I suppose,&rdquo; he sighed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s&hellip; difficult for me to say what I really, truly love.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I\n can assure you, Todoroki-san,&rdquo; Yaoyorozu smiled. &ldquo;This is a very safe \nspace.&rdquo; She placed her hand over her chest and stood up straight. &ldquo;I \nswear, anything you tell me will not leave this rooftop deck.&rdquo;</p><p>His eye widened as he watched her.</p><p>\n &nbsp;<i>Cute!</i>\n</p><p>It made his chest clench a little. Was this what it meant to have a crush?</p><p>It was a foolish feeling, since he most likely wouldn&rsquo;t see her after this vacation was over&hellip; and yet&hellip;</p><p>He didn&rsquo;t hate the way his heart fluttered when he looked at her.</p><p>He\n nodded his head at her. &ldquo;Thank you, Yaoyorozu-san. It&rsquo;s not that I \ndon&rsquo;t trust you.&rdquo; In fact, there was something very appealing about \nspeaking to her. She didn&rsquo;t know him, had no bias towards him or his \npast or how he acted in school. However, he didn&rsquo;t want to make a \ncomplete fool of himself.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m glad I seem trustworthy!&rdquo; she smiled.</p><p>&ldquo;Mhm,&rdquo; he nodded. &ldquo;I suppose&hellip; it&rsquo;s hard for me to say it because I&rsquo;m not sure what I love.&rdquo;</p><p>Her\n brow furrowed, looking at him with such concern. There was a part of \nhim that regretted speaking up, because he much preferred when he was \nable to make her smile.</p><p>&ldquo;Can I ask what you mean?&rdquo; she said softly, her dark eyes waiting patiently for him to speak.</p><p>&ldquo;My\n father,&rdquo; he began slowly, &ldquo;he wants me to take over his company. He&rsquo;s a\n businessman. My whole life he&rsquo;s been pushing me. It&rsquo;s always been my \nonly purpose.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Your whole life?&rdquo; she asked, gently prodding for more information, though nothing about her tone or demeanor was pushy.</p><p>&ldquo;Mmm&hellip;&rdquo;\n he nodded. &ldquo;My eldest brother was sickly as a child and deemed \nunworthy. He&rsquo;s studying abroad now to be a doctor. My sister, as a \nwoman, was not worthy to him&hellip; Natsuo, the brother you met, he is far \ntoo easily distractible and my father couldn&rsquo;t put up with it,&rdquo; he \nexplained. &ldquo;Then there was me, and I am being molded into his perfect \nlittle heir.&rdquo; There was a bite to his tone and he turned towards the \nrailing, staring at the snow pooled on top of it.</p><p>He swallowed, \nwondering if he had said too much. It wasn&rsquo;t like him to speak about his\n family so freely, but Yaoyorozu made him feel so comfortable.</p><p>&ldquo;Todoroki-san,&rdquo;\n she whispered, reaching over to place her gloved hand over his. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so\n sorry. Is business something you&rsquo;re interested in?&rdquo; she asked. Her \nvoice was so genuine, and even through his glove, he could feel the \ngentle pressure and squeeze from her hand.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I&rsquo;ve \nnever been given the freedom to think about it,&rdquo; he admitted. He wasn&rsquo;t \nsure anyone had ever even asked him a question like that.</p><p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;Are there any&hellip; hobbies you have that you enjoy? Something you pull joy from?&rdquo; she asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Mmm.&rdquo; Shouto hummed softly. &ldquo;I enjoy this. Skiing, I mean. Or I used to.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What changed?&rdquo; she asked.</p><p>Shouto\n froze, his heart suddenly throbbing in his ears. He knew exactly what \nchanged, but the words were trapped in his throat. He couldn&rsquo;t just say \nit, could he?</p><p>\n &nbsp;<i>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s your mother&hellip;&rdquo;</i>\n</p><p>\n &nbsp;<i>&ldquo;She&hellip;&rdquo;</i>\n</p><p>&ldquo;I&hellip;&rdquo; He let out a soft breath, a heated cloud curling in the air in front of him. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he lied.</p><p>&ldquo;I\n see,&rdquo; she whispered. Maybe she could tell he wasn&rsquo;t giving her the full\n story, but she was far too polite to ask for any further details.</p><p>&ldquo;What\n about you,&rdquo; he asked, changing the subject. Dwelling on his mother was \nnever good for his mental state, and so far the majority of this trip \nhad brought back nostalgic memories which made his heart ache. He didn&rsquo;t\n want to think about it, not when he was spending time with her. He had \ntalked about himself far too much already.</p><p>&ldquo;Me?&rdquo; she gasped. &ldquo;I-I&hellip; admittedly after hearing your story I feel a little foolish,&rdquo; she said.</p><p>&ldquo;What? Please Yaoyorozu-san, that wasn&rsquo;t my intention,&rdquo; he urged.</p><p>&ldquo;I-I\n know!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s silly. My parents keep pressuring me to decide \nwhat I want to do with my future. I&rsquo;ve been accepted to the university I\n wanted and unlike you, my father doesn&rsquo;t mind if I take a different \npath with my life&hellip; however, I know he wants me in a stable position. \nYou should&rsquo;ve heard him tonight,&rdquo; she laughed sadly. &ldquo;Kyouka is a \nmusician and he was <i>very</i> concerned I planned on following her.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ah, parents,&rdquo; Shouto sighed.</p><p>&ldquo;Right?&rdquo;\n she said, sighing along with him. &ldquo;I actually really enjoy chemistry, \nbut I have no idea if my father would approve. I don&rsquo;t know where \nexactly I can go and be a chemist. Maybe I could teach&hellip;&rdquo; she babbled, \nnervously stroking the end of her hair between her gloved fingers. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s\n overwhelming, to think about and consider your future. I was hoping \nthis trip would be a nice break from it all, but almost every dinner my \nfather brings it up.&rdquo;</p><p>They had opposite problems. Shouto was being\n forced into a set future, one he couldn&rsquo;t change, and Yaoyorozu was \nspiraling along an uncertain path, one she couldn&rsquo;t decide upon.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve\n mentioned it to Kyouka, but her family is so relaxed and supportive of \nher music, she tends to not understand why I don&rsquo;t just choose what I \nwant,&rdquo; she continued. &ldquo;While that&rsquo;s nice to think about, I worry my \nfather won&rsquo;t approve.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; he nodded.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s not pleasant to hear about my horribly wishy-washy decisions.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Please, pressure, regardless of what form, is never pleasant,&rdquo; he muttered. He knew this quite well.</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you, Todoroki-san,&rdquo; she said, bowing to him. &ldquo;I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well\n thank you for doing the same,&rdquo; he chuckled, nodding. He did feel a bit \nguilty for speaking to her so much, but at the same time&hellip; she had been\n so open with him too. In a strange way, he felt she understood him.</p><p>&ldquo;Perhaps we could&hellip; speak up here again sometime in the next week and a half,&rdquo; she said, a smile pulling across her features.</p><p>He would&rsquo;ve spoken to her up here every night if he could.</p><p>&ldquo;I would like that. You&rsquo;re right, it is very peaceful and calm up here.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Mhm,&rdquo; she said and placed her finger against her lips. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a secret! But I&rsquo;m happy to share it with you.&rdquo;</p><p>He bowed his head to her and chuckled. &ldquo;I feel quite honored to know about it then.&rdquo;</p><p>She\n nodded and reluctantly pulled her hand away from his, realizing she \nstill had it resting over his. &ldquo;I-I do wish you could come to the party \ntomorrow night, but I understand your father is quite intense!&rdquo; she \nsighed.</p><p>He clenched his hands around the railing. He wanted more \nthan anything to come to the party and spend more time with her. \n&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll&hellip; make it,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll figure out a way to get away from him \nand-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ah! Please don&rsquo;t get in trouble, Todoroki-san!&rdquo; she said, her eyes shimmering with nervousness.</p><p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he chuckled.</p><p>The\n two of them stayed on the roof for a bit longer, letting the night \nslowly wear on. For now they were free from their burdens, their \nfamilies slept soundly while they spoke into the night, and Shouto knew \nhe had to get to that party, no matter what.</p><p>~~</p><p>&ldquo;Someone&rsquo;s \nglowing,&rdquo; Kyouka said, flopping onto Momo&rsquo;s bed. The two met up after \nskiing and showering the next day. The party was only a few hours away \nand the two girls had plans to get dinner and head over to the pool.</p><p>&ldquo;Glowing?!&rdquo; she gasped and slid the closet door open, searching through the clothes she hung up. &ldquo;I-I don&rsquo;t know about that.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Have you been texting with Todoroki?&rdquo; she teased.</p><p>&ldquo;Well&hellip;&rdquo;\n she cleared her throat. &ldquo;We actually spent some time together on the \nroof.&rdquo; She braced herself, ready for the reaction from her friend.</p><p>&ldquo;<i>What?!</i> Yaoyorozu Momo, taking a <i>boy</i> up to her very special spot?!&rdquo; Kyouka gasped, clutching her hand against her chest as she leaned forward on the bed.</p><p>&ldquo;K-Kyouka!\n It wasn&rsquo;t a big deal. He was having a difficult time with his father \nand so I invited him up for some peace and quiet.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sure, sure,&rdquo; \nshe nodded, folding her arms over her chest. &ldquo;Peace and quiet, and then \nyou proceeded to talk his ear off I assume.&rdquo;</p><p>Momo popped her head out of the closet, her cheeks bright red. &ldquo;Oh gosh&hellip; I probably did talk too much!&rdquo;</p><p>Kyouka scoffed. &ldquo;I doubt you did, I was just making a joke.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;R-Right&hellip;&rdquo;\n Momo sighed. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know it was&hellip; pleasant. I think we sort of \nunderstood each other even though our problems are <i>very</i> \ndifferent.&rdquo; She smiled, glancing towards her window as she pulled a \nsweater off of the hanger. &ldquo;And he did say he was going to try and make \nit to the party tonight.&rdquo; She hummed, clutching the sweater to her chest\n as she rocked back and forth happily.</p><p>&ldquo;Great. So are you ready to admit this crush you have on him?&rdquo; Kyouka smirked, raising her eyebrow at her best friend.</p><p>&ldquo;Huh?!&rdquo;\n She froze. Admittedly, she had an amazing time on the roof last night. \nBesides Kyouka, she couldn&rsquo;t remember ever connecting with someone that \nfast. They spoke for so long and Todoroki admitted his love of soba \nnoodles and his frustrations with his family. She too, had admitted her \nown frustrations, though hearing his did make her feel a little guilty.</p><p>She\n wanted to say she liked him. When she thought about him her heart \nfluttered and she couldn&rsquo;t stop smiling. But there was a gentle ache in \nher heart as well, reminding her that this vacation wouldn&rsquo;t be forever.\n As much as she and Kyouka had connected and kept in touch&hellip; a long \ndistance relationship was extremely difficult, and Momo was about to \nhead to university. She didn&rsquo;t need that sort of distraction.</p><p>&ldquo;I already told you I would only admit it, if <i>you</i> admit your crush on Kaminari-san!&rdquo; Momo continued, immediately changing the subject.</p><p>&ldquo;What?! This has nothing to do with me and him!&rdquo; Kyouka sputtered.</p><p>&ldquo;When are you two going to ski together?&rdquo; Momo teased.</p><p>&ldquo;Uh, excuse you, he snowboards, which is why we <i>won&rsquo;t</i> be 'skiing&rsquo; together,&rdquo; she said.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; Momo sighed dramatically. &ldquo;When are you going to hit the slopes together?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Uh, never,&rdquo; Kyouka snorted.</p><p>&ldquo;So\n you&rsquo;re ready to see him tonight then?&rdquo; Momo asked, humming as she began\n to button up the red sweater around her white tank top.</p><p>&ldquo;Whatever,&rdquo; Kyouka said, flopping back down onto the bed. &ldquo;Who knows if we&rsquo;ll even talk.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t he say he would see you there?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, Yaomomo, <i>seeing</i> something and actually <i>talking</i> to someone are two totally different things!&rdquo; Kyouka said, staring up at the ceiling.</p><p>&ldquo;Ah, right,&rdquo; Momo snorted, pulling her long dark hair up into a ponytail. &ldquo;How could I ever possibly forget?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, but you have to trust me on this one,&rdquo; Kyouka explained.</p><p>&ldquo;Right, you are the dating expert,&rdquo; Momo said, nodding at her friend.</p><p>&ldquo;Between the two of us, I really am,&rdquo; Kyouka said. She pushed herself up and stretched. &ldquo;We ready for dinner?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I\n don&rsquo;t understand why you&rsquo;re so hesitant to say you like Kaminari-san, \nyou&rsquo;ve never held back in the past,&rdquo; Momo asked, ignoring her question \nabout dinner.</p><p>&ldquo;I-I dunno!&rdquo; Kyouka hummed. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s&hellip; a nerd.&rdquo; She pursed her lips, and Momo could tell her friend knew it was a poor excuse.</p><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with nerds you know?&rdquo; she huffed.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re fine, but&hellip; I dunno&hellip; he&rsquo;s just not my normal type.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; Momo began, hooking her arm through Kyouka&rsquo;s, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s a good thing!&rdquo;</p><p>Kyouka sighed, grabbing her small bag. &ldquo;Who knows&hellip;&rdquo; She rolled her eyes and nudged Momo. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have fun regardless.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Of\n course!&rdquo; Momo smiled. As much as she knew that was true, deep down \nthere was a small part of her that hoped she would get a chance to see \nTodoroki there.</p>",
