How many? Gosh, it must have been at least six. And yet you know exactly who is making it the moment you hear the first <i>tick</i> of a pebble hitting your window pane. At first you think you\u2019re imagining it but there\u2019s no mistaking it\u2019s real when the second rock strikes the glass.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no way,\u201d you whisper to yourself as you set your laptop down on your comforter and get up off your bed. Two more rocks hit your window as you make your way over to it to peer out. Of course being eleven o\u2019 clock at night and living miles out of the city and away from the lights, it\u2019s pitch black outside. But as your eyes adjust to the darkness, you see a figure standing below your window in your gravel driveway. The figure is taller than you remember but the way he stands makes him undeniably familiar.</p><p>\u201cTae,\u201d you whisper, his name bringing a smile to your lips.</p><!-- more --><p>The figure takes a step closer to the house triggering the motion sensor and suddenly the gravel driveway is flooded with cold light.</p><p>If you had any doubts about who it was a minute ago, you don\u2019t now as he steps into the light, his face stretched into his familiar rectangular grin. He lifts a hand and gives you a small wave. You lift your own in reply before rushing to grab a jacket and making your way downstairs\u2014quietly so as to not disturb your parents\u2014and then outside.</p><p>He\u2019s waiting there in the driveway, his hands stuffed into the pockets of a very expensive looking jacket. His hair is longer and silvery brown, his body broader\u2014though still lanky\u2014his face leaner, sharper, features less boyish and more manly. He\u2019s changed so much yet you still see hints of the boy you grew up with in his smile and by the spark of childish curiosity in his brown eyes. Fame hasn\u2019t changed him completely, it seems.</p><p>With a squeal, you run off your porch, throwing your arms around his neck as you crash into him. He laughs against your ear as he lifts you into the air and swings you around. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d you ask, goosebumps raising on your skin from the sensation of his breath on your neck.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re on vacation so I\u2019m in town for a few days visiting family,\u201d he says. \u201cI heard you were home from school and I couldn\u2019t resist stopping by.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the middle of the night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust like old times,\u201d Taehyung replies, then his eyes drift down to your slippered feet. \u201cNice jammies,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cNice shoes,\u201d you retort and lift an eyebrow. \u201cGucci?\u201d</p><p>Taehyung shrugs.</p><p>\u201cNot quite like old times, huh?\u201d you ask, your voice a little quieter.</p><p>\u201cI guess.\u201d</p><p>The air is cold even for it being the middle of summer and the thin hoodie you grabbed doesn\u2019t quite protect you from it. \u201cSo\u2026how\u2019ve you been?\u201d you finally ask him, kicking at the gravel with the toe of your slipper.</p><p>Taehyung knocks his shoe against yours. \u201cGood,\u201d he says. \u201cBusy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo kidding,\u201d you say with a chuckle. \u201cI saw all of your performances and interviews from when you were in America. Did you even have time to sleep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI managed to get a few minutes on the car rides,\u201d he says and gives you a smirk. You shake your head.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re on vacation and instead of sleeping, you\u2019re throwing rocks at my window? Are you crazy?\u201d you ask nudging him with your elbow. That\u2019s when you notice the small paper sack sitting on the ground beside his foot. Your eyes grow wide as you meet his and smile. \u201cAre those\u2026?\u201d</p><p>Taehyung nods and picks the bag up. \u201cShall we?\u201d he asks offering you his arm.</p><p>\u201cHeck yes!\u201d you reply and hook your own arm through his.</p><p>*</p><p>You loved growing up in the country. A farmer\u2019s daughter, you used to skip through the fields, picking and eating the sun-ripened fruits and vegetables directly off the plants\u2014even after your father told you countless times not to. The tomatoes were juicy, the carrots sweet, the radishes spicy. But nothing compared to the strawberries grown by the family that lived next door.</p><p>You used to sneak under the fence, sprinting as fast as your little legs could go and then snatching up as many berries as your hands could carry before running back to the safety of your side of the fence. You were able to do that only a few times before you were inevitably caught. Though the one that caught you couldn\u2019t do much more than tattle as he was only a year older than you, and slower. Eventually he realized his snitching wasn\u2019t deterring you and started helping you instead find the ripest, biggest ones. Then the two of you would sit on your own sides of the fence, your loot pile between you as you partook in your little feast.</p><p>One summer night when you were around thirteen, you happened to be looking out your bedroom window, which faced the strawberry fields, and caught sight of Taehyung laying in the dirt among the plants, his lanky form dusted with moonlight. You decided to cross over the fence line and join him, not saying a word as you lay down beside him. The two of you stayed that way for almost an hour, staring up at the stars that peppered the cobalt blue sky. Where you live, miles from the city, you don\u2019t see the stars. You see galaxies. And so almost every night of that summer, the two of you met out in the strawberry fields and gazed up at the galaxies together.</p><p>The following summer, your were fourteen and he was fifteen, and while the night sky was magical and deserving of being admired in silence, the two of you instead lay sprawled on your backs, a small paper bag of strawberries sitting between you, your conversations and loud laughter filling the night air. One night, you felt his fingers brush yours and though you didn\u2019t pull your hand away, you didn\u2019t show a reaction either. That was the last summer you did this together, as the next one he was gone, living in a big city far away, unknowingly training to someday become a member of the biggest boy band in the world.</p><p>*</p><p>In the dark, your slipper finds a rock sticking out of the dirt and you stumble, Taehyung quickly shooting a hand out to grab you before you fall. The sounds of your giggling echo through the field as you regain your balance and continue on with him.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you weren\u2019t up there getting wasted before I showed up?\u201d he asks through his own laughter.</p><p>\u201cHey, these things are not the easiest to maneuver uneven terrain in,\u201d you respond. Neither of you have even acknowledged the fact that your hands are still clasped. \u201cMaybe you should let me borrow those babies,\u201d you add gesturing to his expensive shoes. \u201cI bet they cost more than my tuition.\u201d</p><p>Taehyung scoffs but doesn\u2019t respond with a sarcastic remark like you expected him to. Well, crap, now you feel bad. Suddenly, he stops walking, looking back the way you came and then up at the sky. \u201cThis seems like a good spot,\u201d he says then sits down on the ground and sets the paper bag down beside him.</p><p>You stand there for a minute chewing on your bottom lip thoughtfully. The fact that he\u2019s willing to dirty his designer clothes probably because he can afford to just buy more isn\u2019t lost on you. But of course as soon as that thought enters your mind, a rush of guilt stabs you in the chest. How dare you think such a thing about Taehyung? He\u2019s done nothing to deserve such judgement. Besides being an idol, he\u2019s still your Taehyung. Just a boy sitting in the dirt, moonlight tracing his features, a hint of his boxy grin playing on his lips as he looks up at you expectantly.</p><p>\u201cY/N?\u201d he says, \u201cAre you going to sit down?\u201d</p><p>At last you snap out of your thoughts. \u201cWhat? Yeah, sorry,\u201d you say before plopping down next to him. As you do, your arm bumps the bag and it falls over with a heavy thunk. You glance up at Taehyung and raise an eyebrow. \u201cThose are some heavy strawberries, huh?\u201d</p><p>Taehyung\u2019s smile widens as he reaches into the bag and pulls out a bottle. \u201cI figured we\u2019ve graduated to <i>Champagne</i> and strawberries this summer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOoh,\u201d you say bouncing your knees excitedly. \u201cI feel so grown up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I were really grown up, I would have thought to bring glasses,\u201d Taehyung says and pops the top off with a bottle opener.</p><p>You grab the bottle from him. \u201cEh, I\u2019m a college student,\u201d you say then take a swig. The alcohol comes alive in your mouth, tingling over your tongue before fizzing its way down your throat. You feel warmth begin to bloom in your stomach as you pass the bottle back to him. \u201cMaybe next summer we can graduate again to glasses.\u201d</p><p>Taehyung points the neck of the bottle your way, \u201ccheers to that,\u201d he says before tipping his head back and taking a big drink of his own. His face contorts into a sour expression before he\u2019s able to swallow. \u201c<i>That</i> is terrible,\u201d he croaks and you promptly burst out laughing. \u201cStrawberry, stat!\u201d</p><p>While you\u2019re still trying to get your laughter back under control, you reach into the bag and pull out a berry. He quickly snatches it out of your hand and pops the whole thing into his mouth, his cheeks expanding to their fullest as he chews on it. Suddenly, a thoughtful expression falls over his face and he nods slowly as he continues chewing the berry.</p><p>\u201cNot bad,\u201d he finally says. \u201cChampagne with a strawberry chaser, who knew?\u201d Then he shoves the bottle back into your hand. \u201cTry it.\u201d</p><p>You can\u2019t help but laugh again. \u201cChampagne and strawberries together? How has no one ever thought of that before?\u201d</p><p>The two of you continue passing the bottle back and forth and before too long, it and the berries are gone and you feel weightless. You run your tongue across your lower lip, catching some of the juice that has dried as you look up at the stars. They seem brighter. Closer somehow. Curiously, you lift your arm up, watching your fingers as they flex, as if you can almost hook one around one of those glittering sparks above you. Out of the corner of your eye, you see another arm stretch up then reach over, fingers grasping your own.</p><p>For a moment, you study the two hands, silhouetted against the blue. Watch the fingers brush and then intertwine, palms pressing together. When you do finally tear your eyes away from the sight and turn your head, Taehyung is looking back at you.</p><p>\u201cDo you remember when we were younger and we were out here looking up at the stars and I touched your hand?\u201d His voice is so low it comes out as barely more than a whisper.</p><p>You nod your head.</p><p>\u201cAnd you didn\u2019t say anything. And you didn\u2019t do anything.\u201d Then he swallows thickly. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you do anything?\u201d</p><p>You close your eyes and pull his hand down so you\u2019re holding it against your stomach. \u201cIt was perfect, Tae,\u201d you whisper back. \u201cWe were just young and those nights we would meet and look up at the stars together were perfect. And I think I was afraid that they would end if anything between us changed.\u201d Then you open your eyes again. \u201cAnd if anything changed then, who knows where we would be now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably not here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, probably not.\u201d</p><p>Taehyung bites his lip thoughtfully, his eyes traveling down to where his hand rests entwined with yours on your stomach. \u201cBut what about now?\u201d</p><p>You look up again at the stars and they wink back as if they just shared their deepest secrets with you. As if they\u2019ve known all along what it has taken you many years to realize on your own. Then with a smile, you meet Taehyung\u2019s eyes again. \u201cI think change is good,\u201d you say.</p><p>That\u2019s all he needs to hear before leaning in to press his lips to yours and instead of the two of you admiring the galaxies in the night sky, the galaxies admire the two of you.</p>",

How many? Gosh, it must have been at least six. And yet you know exactly who is making it the moment you hear the first <i>tick</i> of a pebble hitting your window pane. At first you think you\u2019re imagining it but there\u2019s no mistaking it\u2019s real when the second rock strikes the glass.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no way,\u201d you whisper to yourself as you set your laptop down on your comforter and get up off your bed. Two more rocks hit your window as you make your way over to it to peer out. Of course being eleven o\u2019 clock at night and living miles out of the city and away from the lights, it\u2019s pitch black outside. But as your eyes adjust to the darkness, you see a figure standing below your window in your gravel driveway. The figure is taller than you remember but the way he stands makes him undeniably familiar.</p><p>\u201cTae,\u201d you whisper, his name bringing a smile to your lips.</p>[[MORE]]<p>The figure takes a step closer to the house triggering the motion sensor and suddenly the gravel driveway is flooded with cold light.</p><p>If you had any doubts about who it was a minute ago, you don\u2019t now as he steps into the light, his face stretched into his familiar rectangular grin. He lifts a hand and gives you a small wave. You lift your own in reply before rushing to grab a jacket and making your way downstairs\u2014quietly so as to not disturb your parents\u2014and then outside.</p><p>He\u2019s waiting there in the driveway, his hands stuffed into the pockets of a very expensive looking jacket. His hair is longer and silvery brown, his body broader\u2014though still lanky\u2014his face leaner, sharper, features less boyish and more manly. He\u2019s changed so much yet you still see hints of the boy you grew up with in his smile and by the spark of childish curiosity in his brown eyes. Fame hasn\u2019t changed him completely, it seems.</p><p>With a squeal, you run off your porch, throwing your arms around his neck as you crash into him. He laughs against your ear as he lifts you into the air and swings you around. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d you ask, goosebumps raising on your skin from the sensation of his breath on your neck.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re on vacation so I\u2019m in town for a few days visiting family,\u201d he says. \u201cI heard you were home from school and I couldn\u2019t resist stopping by.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the middle of the night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust like old times,\u201d Taehyung replies, then his eyes drift down to your slippered feet. \u201cNice jammies,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cNice shoes,\u201d you retort and lift an eyebrow. \u201cGucci?\u201d</p><p>Taehyung shrugs.</p><p>\u201cNot quite like old times, huh?\u201d you ask, your voice a little quieter.</p><p>\u201cI guess.\u201d</p><p>The air is cold even for it being the middle of summer and the thin hoodie you grabbed doesn\u2019t quite protect you from it. \u201cSo\u2026how\u2019ve you been?\u201d you finally ask him, kicking at the gravel with the toe of your slipper.</p><p>Taehyung knocks his shoe against yours. \u201cGood,\u201d he says. \u201cBusy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo kidding,\u201d you say with a chuckle. \u201cI saw all of your performances and interviews from when you were in America. Did you even have time to sleep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI managed to get a few minutes on the car rides,\u201d he says and gives you a smirk. You shake your head.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re on vacation and instead of sleeping, you\u2019re throwing rocks at my window? Are you crazy?\u201d you ask nudging him with your elbow. That\u2019s when you notice the small paper sack sitting on the ground beside his foot. Your eyes grow wide as you meet his and smile. \u201cAre those\u2026?\u201d</p><p>Taehyung nods and picks the bag up. \u201cShall we?\u201d he asks offering you his arm.</p><p>\u201cHeck yes!\u201d you reply and hook your own arm through his.</p><p>*</p><p>You loved growing up in the country. A farmer\u2019s daughter, you used to skip through the fields, picking and eating the sun-ripened fruits and vegetables directly off the plants\u2014even after your father told you countless times not to. The tomatoes were juicy, the carrots sweet, the radishes spicy. But nothing compared to the strawberries grown by the family that lived next door.</p><p>You used to sneak under the fence, sprinting as fast as your little legs could go and then snatching up as many berries as your hands could carry before running back to the safety of your side of the fence. You were able to do that only a few times before you were inevitably caught. Though the one that caught you couldn\u2019t do much more than tattle as he was only a year older than you, and slower. Eventually he realized his snitching wasn\u2019t deterring you and started helping you instead find the ripest, biggest ones. Then the two of you would sit on your own sides of the fence, your loot pile between you as you partook in your little feast.</p><p>One summer night when you were around thirteen, you happened to be looking out your bedroom window, which faced the strawberry fields, and caught sight of Taehyung laying in the dirt among the plants, his lanky form dusted with moonlight. You decided to cross over the fence line and join him, not saying a word as you lay down beside him. The two of you stayed that way for almost an hour, staring up at the stars that peppered the cobalt blue sky. Where you live, miles from the city, you don\u2019t see the stars. You see galaxies. And so almost every night of that summer, the two of you met out in the strawberry fields and gazed up at the galaxies together.</p><p>The following summer, your were fourteen and he was fifteen, and while the night sky was magical and deserving of being admired in silence, the two of you instead lay sprawled on your backs, a small paper bag of strawberries sitting between you, your conversations and loud laughter filling the night air. One night, you felt his fingers brush yours and though you didn\u2019t pull your hand away, you didn\u2019t show a reaction either. That was the last summer you did this together, as the next one he was gone, living in a big city far away, unknowingly training to someday become a member of the biggest boy band in the world.</p><p>*</p><p>In the dark, your slipper finds a rock sticking out of the dirt and you stumble, Taehyung quickly shooting a hand out to grab you before you fall. The sounds of your giggling echo through the field as you regain your balance and continue on with him.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you weren\u2019t up there getting wasted before I showed up?\u201d he asks through his own laughter.</p><p>\u201cHey, these things are not the easiest to maneuver uneven terrain in,\u201d you respond. Neither of you have even acknowledged the fact that your hands are still clasped. \u201cMaybe you should let me borrow those babies,\u201d you add gesturing to his expensive shoes. \u201cI bet they cost more than my tuition.\u201d</p><p>Taehyung scoffs but doesn\u2019t respond with a sarcastic remark like you expected him to. Well, crap, now you feel bad. Suddenly, he stops walking, looking back the way you came and then up at the sky. \u201cThis seems like a good spot,\u201d he says then sits down on the ground and sets the paper bag down beside him.</p><p>You stand there for a minute chewing on your bottom lip thoughtfully. The fact that he\u2019s willing to dirty his designer clothes probably because he can afford to just buy more isn\u2019t lost on you. But of course as soon as that thought enters your mind, a rush of guilt stabs you in the chest. How dare you think such a thing about Taehyung? He\u2019s done nothing to deserve such judgement. Besides being an idol, he\u2019s still your Taehyung. Just a boy sitting in the dirt, moonlight tracing his features, a hint of his boxy grin playing on his lips as he looks up at you expectantly.</p><p>\u201cY/N?\u201d he says, \u201cAre you going to sit down?\u201d</p><p>At last you snap out of your thoughts. \u201cWhat? Yeah, sorry,\u201d you say before plopping down next to him. As you do, your arm bumps the bag and it falls over with a heavy thunk. You glance up at Taehyung and raise an eyebrow. \u201cThose are some heavy strawberries, huh?\u201d</p><p>Taehyung\u2019s smile widens as he reaches into the bag and pulls out a bottle. \u201cI figured we\u2019ve graduated to <i>Champagne</i> and strawberries this summer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOoh,\u201d you say bouncing your knees excitedly. \u201cI feel so grown up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I were really grown up, I would have thought to bring glasses,\u201d Taehyung says and pops the top off with a bottle opener.</p><p>You grab the bottle from him. \u201cEh, I\u2019m a college student,\u201d you say then take a swig. The alcohol comes alive in your mouth, tingling over your tongue before fizzing its way down your throat. You feel warmth begin to bloom in your stomach as you pass the bottle back to him. \u201cMaybe next summer we can graduate again to glasses.\u201d</p><p>Taehyung points the neck of the bottle your way, \u201ccheers to that,\u201d he says before tipping his head back and taking a big drink of his own. His face contorts into a sour expression before he\u2019s able to swallow. \u201c<i>That</i> is terrible,\u201d he croaks and you promptly burst out laughing. \u201cStrawberry, stat!\u201d</p><p>While you\u2019re still trying to get your laughter back under control, you reach into the bag and pull out a berry. He quickly snatches it out of your hand and pops the whole thing into his mouth, his cheeks expanding to their fullest as he chews on it. Suddenly, a thoughtful expression falls over his face and he nods slowly as he continues chewing the berry.</p><p>\u201cNot bad,\u201d he finally says. \u201cChampagne with a strawberry chaser, who knew?\u201d Then he shoves the bottle back into your hand. \u201cTry it.\u201d</p><p>You can\u2019t help but laugh again. \u201cChampagne and strawberries together? How has no one ever thought of that before?\u201d</p><p>The two of you continue passing the bottle back and forth and before too long, it and the berries are gone and you feel weightless. You run your tongue across your lower lip, catching some of the juice that has dried as you look up at the stars. They seem brighter. Closer somehow. Curiously, you lift your arm up, watching your fingers as they flex, as if you can almost hook one around one of those glittering sparks above you. Out of the corner of your eye, you see another arm stretch up then reach over, fingers grasping your own.</p><p>For a moment, you study the two hands, silhouetted against the blue. Watch the fingers brush and then intertwine, palms pressing together. When you do finally tear your eyes away from the sight and turn your head, Taehyung is looking back at you.</p><p>\u201cDo you remember when we were younger and we were out here looking up at the stars and I touched your hand?\u201d His voice is so low it comes out as barely more than a whisper.</p><p>You nod your head.</p><p>\u201cAnd you didn\u2019t say anything. And you didn\u2019t do anything.\u201d Then he swallows thickly. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you do anything?\u201d</p><p>You close your eyes and pull his hand down so you\u2019re holding it against your stomach. \u201cIt was perfect, Tae,\u201d you whisper back. \u201cWe were just young and those nights we would meet and look up at the stars together were perfect. And I think I was afraid that they would end if anything between us changed.\u201d Then you open your eyes again. \u201cAnd if anything changed then, who knows where we would be now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably not here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, probably not.\u201d</p><p>Taehyung bites his lip thoughtfully, his eyes traveling down to where his hand rests entwined with yours on your stomach. \u201cBut what about now?\u201d</p><p>You look up again at the stars and they wink back as if they just shared their deepest secrets with you. As if they\u2019ve known all along what it has taken you many years to realize on your own. Then with a smile, you meet Taehyung\u2019s eyes again. \u201cI think change is good,\u201d you say.</p><p>That\u2019s all he needs to hear before leaning in to press his lips to yours and instead of the two of you admiring the galaxies in the night sky, the galaxies admire the two of you.</p>",

You glance up at Taehyung and raise an eyebrow. \u201cThose are some heavy strawberries, huh?\u201d</p><p>Taehyung\u2019s smile widens as he reaches into the bag and pulls out a bottle. \u201cI figured we\u2019ve graduated to <i>Champagne</i> and strawberries this summer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOoh,\u201d you say bouncing your knees excitedly. \u201cI feel so grown up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I were really grown up, I would have thought to bring glasses,\u201d Taehyung says and pops the top off with a bottle opener.</p><p>You grab the bottle from him. \u201cEh, I\u2019m a college student,\u201d you say then take a swig. The alcohol comes alive in your mouth, tingling over your tongue before fizzing its way down your throat. You feel warmth begin to bloom in your stomach as you pass the bottle back to him. \u201cMaybe next summer we can graduate again to glasses.\u201d</p><p>Taehyung points the neck of the bottle your way, \u201ccheers to that,\u201d he says before tipping his head back and taking a big drink of his own. His face contorts into a sour expression before he\u2019s able to swallow. \u201c<i>That</i> is terrible,\u201d he croaks and you promptly burst out laughing. \u201cStrawberry, stat!\u201d</p><p>While you\u2019re still trying to get your laughter back under control, you reach into the bag and pull out a berry. He quickly snatches it out of your hand and pops the whole thing into his mouth, his cheeks expanding to their fullest as he chews on it. Suddenly, a thoughtful expression falls over his face and he nods slowly as he continues chewing the berry.</p><p>\u201cNot bad,\u201d he finally says. \u201cChampagne with a strawberry chaser, who knew?\u201d Then he shoves the bottle back into your hand. \u201cTry it.\u201d</p><p>You can\u2019t help but laugh again. \u201cChampagne and strawberries together? How has no one ever thought of that before?\u201d</p><p>The two of you continue passing the bottle back and forth and before too long, it and the berries are gone and you feel weightless. You run your tongue across your lower lip, catching some of the juice that has dried as you look up at the stars. They seem brighter. Closer somehow. Curiously, you lift your arm up, watching your fingers as they flex, as if you can almost hook one around one of those glittering sparks above you. Out of the corner of your eye, you see another arm stretch up then reach over, fingers grasping your own.</p><p>For a moment, you study the two hands, silhouetted against the blue. Watch the fingers brush and then intertwine, palms pressing together. When you do finally tear your eyes away from the sight and turn your head, Taehyung is looking back at you.</p><p>\u201cDo you remember when we were younger and we were out here looking up at the stars and I touched your hand?\u201d His voice is so low it comes out as barely more than a whisper.</p><p>You nod your head.</p><p>\u201cAnd you didn\u2019t say anything. And you didn\u2019t do anything.\u201d Then he swallows thickly. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you do anything?\u201d</p><p>You close your eyes and pull his hand down so you\u2019re holding it against your stomach. \u201cIt was perfect, Tae,\u201d you whisper back. \u201cWe were just young and those nights we would meet and look up at the stars together were perfect. And I think I was afraid that they would end if anything between us changed.\u201d Then you open your eyes again. \u201cAnd if anything changed then, who knows where we would be now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably not here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, probably not.\u201d</p><p>Taehyung bites his lip thoughtfully, his eyes traveling down to where his hand rests entwined with yours on your stomach. \u201cBut what about now?\u201d</p><p>You look up again at the stars and they wink back as if they just shared their deepest secrets with you. As if they\u2019ve known all along what it has taken you many years to realize on your own. Then with a smile, you meet Taehyung\u2019s eyes again. \u201cI think change is good,\u201d you say.</p><p>That\u2019s all he needs to hear before leaning in to press his lips to yours and instead of the two of you admiring the galaxies in the night sky, the galaxies admire the two of you.</p>",

How many? Gosh, it must have been at least six. And yet you know exactly who is making it the moment you hear the first <i>tick</i> of a pebble hitting your window pane. At first you think you&rsquo;re imagining it but there&rsquo;s no mistaking it&rsquo;s real when the second rock strikes the glass.</p><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no way,&rdquo; you whisper to yourself as you set your laptop down on your comforter and get up off your bed. Two more rocks hit your window as you make your way over to it to peer out. Of course being eleven o&rsquo; clock at night and living miles out of the city and away from the lights, it&rsquo;s pitch black outside. But as your eyes adjust to the darkness, you see a figure standing below your window in your gravel driveway. The figure is taller than you remember but the way he stands makes him undeniably familiar.</p><p>&ldquo;Tae,&rdquo; you whisper, his name bringing a smile to your lips.</p><p>The figure takes a step closer to the house triggering the motion sensor and suddenly the gravel driveway is flooded with cold light.</p><p>If you had any doubts about who it was a minute ago, you don&rsquo;t now as he steps into the light, his face stretched into his familiar rectangular grin. He lifts a hand and gives you a small wave. You lift your own in reply before rushing to grab a jacket and making your way downstairs&mdash;quietly so as to not disturb your parents&mdash;and then outside.</p><p>He&rsquo;s waiting there in the driveway, his hands stuffed into the pockets of a very expensive looking jacket. His hair is longer and silvery brown, his body broader&mdash;though still lanky&mdash;his face leaner, sharper, features less boyish and more manly. He&rsquo;s changed so much yet you still see hints of the boy you grew up with in his smile and by the spark of childish curiosity in his brown eyes. Fame hasn&rsquo;t changed him completely, it seems.</p><p>With a squeal, you run off your porch, throwing your arms around his neck as you crash into him. He laughs against your ear as he lifts you into the air and swings you around. &ldquo;What are you doing here?&rdquo; you ask, goosebumps raising on your skin from the sensation of his breath on your neck.</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re on vacation so I&rsquo;m in town for a few days visiting family,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;I heard you were home from school and I couldn&rsquo;t resist stopping by.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;In the middle of the night?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Just like old times,&rdquo; Taehyung replies, then his eyes drift down to your slippered feet. &ldquo;Nice jammies,&rdquo; he says.</p><p>&ldquo;Nice shoes,&rdquo; you retort and lift an eyebrow. &ldquo;Gucci?&rdquo;</p><p>Taehyung shrugs.</p><p>&ldquo;Not quite like old times, huh?&rdquo; you ask, your voice a little quieter.</p><p>&ldquo;I guess.&rdquo;</p><p>The air is cold even for it being the middle of summer and the thin hoodie you grabbed doesn&rsquo;t quite protect you from it. &ldquo;So&hellip;how&rsquo;ve you been?&rdquo; you finally ask him, kicking at the gravel with the toe of your slipper.</p><p>Taehyung knocks his shoe against yours. &ldquo;Good,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Busy.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No kidding,&rdquo; you say with a chuckle. &ldquo;I saw all of your performances and interviews from when you were in America. Did you even have time to sleep?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I managed to get a few minutes on the car rides,&rdquo; he says and gives you a smirk. You shake your head.</p><p>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re on vacation and instead of sleeping, you&rsquo;re throwing rocks at my window? Are you crazy?&rdquo; you ask nudging him with your elbow. That&rsquo;s when you notice the small paper sack sitting on the ground beside his foot. Your eyes grow wide as you meet his and smile. &ldquo;Are those&hellip;?&rdquo;</p><p>Taehyung nods and picks the bag up. &ldquo;Shall we?&rdquo; he asks offering you his arm.</p><p>&ldquo;Heck yes!&rdquo; you reply and hook your own arm through his.</p><p>*</p><p>You loved growing up in the country. A farmer&rsquo;s daughter, you used to skip through the fields, picking and eating the sun-ripened fruits and vegetables directly off the plants&mdash;even after your father told you countless times not to. The tomatoes were juicy, the carrots sweet, the radishes spicy. But nothing compared to the strawberries grown by the family that lived next door.</p><p>You used to sneak under the fence, sprinting as fast as your little legs could go and then snatching up as many berries as your hands could carry before running back to the safety of your side of the fence. You were able to do that only a few times before you were inevitably caught. Though the one that caught you couldn&rsquo;t do much more than tattle as he was only a year older than you, and slower. Eventually he realized his snitching wasn&rsquo;t deterring you and started helping you instead find the ripest, biggest ones. Then the two of you would sit on your own sides of the fence, your loot pile between you as you partook in your little feast.</p><p>One summer night when you were around thirteen, you happened to be looking out your bedroom window, which faced the strawberry fields, and caught sight of Taehyung laying in the dirt among the plants, his lanky form dusted with moonlight. You decided to cross over the fence line and join him, not saying a word as you lay down beside him. The two of you stayed that way for almost an hour, staring up at the stars that peppered the cobalt blue sky. Where you live, miles from the city, you don&rsquo;t see the stars. You see galaxies. And so almost every night of that summer, the two of you met out in the strawberry fields and gazed up at the galaxies together.</p><p>The following summer, your were fourteen and he was fifteen, and while the night sky was magical and deserving of being admired in silence, the two of you instead lay sprawled on your backs, a small paper bag of strawberries sitting between you, your conversations and loud laughter filling the night air. One night, you felt his fingers brush yours and though you didn&rsquo;t pull your hand away, you didn&rsquo;t show a reaction either. That was the last summer you did this together, as the next one he was gone, living in a big city far away, unknowingly training to someday become a member of the biggest boy band in the world.</p><p>*</p><p>In the dark, your slipper finds a rock sticking out of the dirt and you stumble, Taehyung quickly shooting a hand out to grab you before you fall. The sounds of your giggling echo through the field as you regain your balance and continue on with him.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you sure you weren&rsquo;t up there getting wasted before I showed up?&rdquo; he asks through his own laughter.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, these things are not the easiest to maneuver uneven terrain in,&rdquo; you respond. Neither of you have even acknowledged the fact that your hands are still clasped. &ldquo;Maybe you should let me borrow those babies,&rdquo; you add gesturing to his expensive shoes. &ldquo;I bet they cost more than my tuition.&rdquo;</p><p>Taehyung scoffs but doesn&rsquo;t respond with a sarcastic remark like you expected him to. Well, crap, now you feel bad. Suddenly, he stops walking, looking back the way you came and then up at the sky. &ldquo;This seems like a good spot,&rdquo; he says then sits down on the ground and sets the paper bag down beside him.</p><p>You stand there for a minute chewing on your bottom lip thoughtfully. The fact that he&rsquo;s willing to dirty his designer clothes probably because he can afford to just buy more isn&rsquo;t lost on you. But of course as soon as that thought enters your mind, a rush of guilt stabs you in the chest. How dare you think such a thing about Taehyung? He&rsquo;s done nothing to deserve such judgement. Besides being an idol, he&rsquo;s still your Taehyung. Just a boy sitting in the dirt, moonlight tracing his features, a hint of his boxy grin playing on his lips as he looks up at you expectantly.</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N?&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;Are you going to sit down?&rdquo;</p><p>At last you snap out of your thoughts. &ldquo;What? Yeah, sorry,&rdquo; you say before plopping down next to him. As you do, your arm bumps the bag and it falls over with a heavy thunk. You glance up at Taehyung and raise an eyebrow. &ldquo;Those are some heavy strawberries, huh?&rdquo;</p><p>Taehyung&rsquo;s smile widens as he reaches into the bag and pulls out a bottle. &ldquo;I figured we&rsquo;ve graduated to <i>Champagne</i> and strawberries this summer.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ooh,&rdquo; you say bouncing your knees excitedly. &ldquo;I feel so grown up.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If I were really grown up, I would have thought to bring glasses,&rdquo; Taehyung says and pops the top off with a bottle opener.</p><p>You grab the bottle from him. &ldquo;Eh, I&rsquo;m a college student,&rdquo; you say then take a swig.

You feel warmth begin to bloom in your stomach as you pass the bottle back to him. &ldquo;Maybe next summer we can graduate again to glasses.&rdquo;</p><p>Taehyung points the neck of the bottle your way, &ldquo;cheers to that,&rdquo; he says before tipping his head back and taking a big drink of his own. His face contorts into a sour expression before he&rsquo;s able to swallow. &ldquo;<i>That</i> is terrible,&rdquo; he croaks and you promptly burst out laughing. &ldquo;Strawberry, stat!&rdquo;</p><p>While you&rsquo;re still trying to get your laughter back under control, you reach into the bag and pull out a berry.
