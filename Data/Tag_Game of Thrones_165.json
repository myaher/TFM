It's like how in S4 they make Sansa a game player, then dehumanized her yet again in S5. It's disheartened me. If that happened, I will wait for other Sansa fans with fiction writing skills to share their fan fictions. Perhaps, after I improved my English, then I will write Sansa fan fictions as well.",

Second of all in season 7, Sansa was shown to be competent and correct in all her arguments and more once she was compared to Jon, Cersei, Daenerys and Arya favourably. There\u2019s a Vanity Fair article that\u2019s meant to make her look bad long after the season aired without screenshots when the product that the audience saw contradicts the supposed script. Things like that tend to cause panic when they shouldn\u2019t. If Sansa was meant to be subservient towards anyone, the EW article puts an end to it. She doesn\u2019t kiss the ground Jon or Daenerys walk on. She\u2019s prominent on the official poster (third most prominent in fact). Peter Dinklage shot down Sanrion when he said Tyrion was in love with Daenerys. There has been no whiff of Sansan anywhere. Not to mention the spoilers have been pretty sparse on Sansa but what they do tell us is good. There\u2019s only one plot point that I don\u2019t like but it might end up being good when we see it.</p>",
