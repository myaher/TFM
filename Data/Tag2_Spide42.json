It was Liz. You smiled in a weird way and set down your tray on the table.</p><p>\u201cOh hi Y/N! I hope it is okay that I\u2019m joining you guys for lunch, I was gonna ask you guys something!\u201d Liz said excitedly and you literally thought to yourself about how she is both pretty and super nice.</p><p>You smiled once again and said\u00a0\u201cOh, of course not! What\u2019s up?\u201d you said trying to sound excited about what she was going to say\u00a0\u201cWell, I am gonna have a party at my house this weekend and I would love all of you to come!\u201d she said excitedly\u00a0\u201cOh, I\u2019m not sure about that I have the whole Stark Internship stuff and-\u201d Liz turned to look at Peter and said \u201cGod Peter you always do this! Please for once live a little!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Peter knew that he wouldn\u2019t wanna go to a stupid party without you there so he quickly turned over to you and said\u00a0\u201cWhat do you say waltz partner?\u201d you looked up in surprise as he asked you and said\u00a0\u201cOh, uhm sure why not.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Liz squealed loudly and hugged Peter out of excitement which caused Peter to giggle softly, Ned and MJ were just watching the whole scene rolling out knowing that they would be okay with whatever you guys were doing.</p><p>But they were silent because they realised you looking at them, wistfully, they both quietly chuckled understanding what the actual fuck was going on.</p><p>As Liz finally left your lunch table you went back to normal and Ned and MJ started questioning you guys about the whole waltz thing, the so confident Y/N who signed them up for waltz vanished for that whole hour.</p><p>For some reason you felt insecure about it, the waltz thing, Peter you were quite embarrassed talking about it which was not you.</p><p>The whole waltz thing was kind of hard though, as you and Peter went to your first class or practice whatever (which was after school btw and was even more tiring), you knew a little bit of waltz from past experiences and Peter literally knew nothing but he was doing it better than you, you kept getting nervous and blushing and fucking it up.</p><p>For someone who knew how to waltz you were a disaster, plus because your friends were there too you were kind of distracted because focusing on Peter seemed kind of weird to you\u00a0 because you kept blushing.</p><p>As you kept getting distracted and more distracted with talking to Hary.\u00a0 Peter was growing out of his patience, you didn\u2019t realise it would be a problem but boy he was pissed.</p><p>You were supposed to do a little turning move that was easy and everyone except you guys could do it so Peter was frustrated because he really wanted to make this work, hell he even watched videos at home and practiced with May for hours just to not fuck this up but you seemed careless to him and you kept chatting up with this new guy from your Spanish class and he couldn\u2019t take that.</p><p>As the song started and you were just about to do the turning move, your friend started mouthing you something from far away which caused you to get distracted once again making you miss out the move and ruin the whole waltz.\u00a0</p><p>Peter furiously looked into your eyes \u201cY/N can you fucking focus for once?\u201d he said a little loudly. You were shocked by his sudden tone of change\u00a0\u201cPeter.. can you calm down?\u201d you said worriedly and he just shook his head</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying to take this shit serious, can you fucking do that too I know it must be hard for you to spend 5 minutes without talking to a guy but still!\u201d\u00a0you were beyond shocked at what he was implying to\u00a0\u201cWhat the fuck does that mean Parker?\u201d he was trying his best to calm down but it didn\u2019t seem possible so he stormed out. Leaving you alone and frustrated.\u00a0</p><p>MJ and Ned seeing everything came to you after the practice by saying stupid jokes like\u00a0\u201cYou know in relationships you do fight right.\u201d But you just shook them off taking your bags and leaving the practice, as you left school you realised that you were supposed to walk home with Peter because it was really late and Peter didn\u2019t want you walking all alone at dark, but since he popped off for no reason, you mentally cursed yourself and tried walking home in the fastest way possible.</p><p>New York is a safe city, New York is a safe city, New York is a safe city you kept repeating yourself this as you were walking through some dark alleys, you literally felt like those stupid characters in horror movies who would choose the dumbest way and die instantly.</p><p>As you were walking you felt (you know that feeling like when someone is behind you) you felt that and slowly turned around fearing for your life, you saw nothing and a sighed in relief\u00a0\u201cIsn\u2019t it dangerous for a girl like you to hang around this late in a dark alley, do you wish to get yourself killed?\u201d said the superhero as he landed in front of you, you were petrified with his surprise entrance and started punching him in the arm\u00a0\u201cFUUCK! Why would you do that?\u201d she said in a horrified voice.</p><p>\u201cOw! Ow, heyy! What did I do, I am trying to save your ass!\u201d he said rubbing his arm and holding it as if he wasn\u2019t a superhero that handled much painful and stronger hits.</p><p>\u201cIs that how you save people by scaring the shit out of them, Jesus!\u201d she exclaimed and tried to catch her breath. He chuckled quietly\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m sorry, you just seemed scared and it\u2019s dark so I thought I could walk you to your home.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSorry spider-man but how do I know that you\u2019re not some old creep? What am I supposed to do just give you my adress? Do you want my security number too while you\u2019re at it?\u201d Peter was truly offended but then he remembered how he kept the secret from you so he softened.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t want you to walk home on your own, I swear I\u2019m not a creep, please just let me walk you home safely.\u201d you looked up at him admiring him and for some reason you felt like you could trust him.</p><p>After a few tries of him trying to make you accept it you finally gave in and he helped you get home safely,most of the way you walked and chatted he was quite fun to talk with but when both of you got kinda tired from walking he decided to take you by your waist and take you home in a much faster way. Him holding you while shooting webs and screaming\u00a0\u201cWOOO!\u201d was one of the best things that happened to you and considering how shitty your day went this whole thing felt really nice to you.</p><p>As Peter finally dropped you of on home by the window safely, he looked at you one last time and said\u00a0\u201cSee you later, uhm, what\u2019s your name?\u201d he said pretending his best to not know you.\u00a0\u201cUh-, it\u2019s Y/N.\u201d you smiled up at him\u00a0\u201cIt was nice chatting up with you but I\u2019ve gotta a whole city to save, see you later Y/N. \u201d you watched as he kept shooting webs and screaming\u00a0\u201cWOOO!\u201d once again making you giggle.\u00a0\u201cSee you later,spidey.\u201d</p><p>You were so tired. so tired. You could barely get yourself to put your pajamas on and you huffed falling down on your bed, falling asleep wasn\u2019t going to be hard you thought, but then all of a sudden you started thinking about Spiderman.</p><p>How he was supposed to be this big mighty hero he indeed was a hero but he was also a dork, a big one and was really cute.</p><p>\u201cPeter is gonna flip when I tell him about how I saw Spiderman yesterday.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>You thought and smirked to yourself as you knew how jealous Peter -also let\u2019s not forget Ned- was going to be when they realized you met the big hero, more importantly the mighty hero walked you home.</p><p>Then it hit you, you were supposed to be mad at Peter,\u00a0he was weird and extremely angry today for no reason, and you remember how much at that moment he irritated you, then\u00a0 you huffed once again at the thought of seeing Peter tomorrow and tried to put off your thoughts about it all at once and went to sleep.</p>",

Please for once live a little!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Peter knew that he wouldn\u2019t wanna go to a stupid party without you there so he quickly turned over to you and said\u00a0\u201cWhat do you say waltz partner?\u201d you looked up in surprise as he asked you and said\u00a0\u201cOh, uhm sure why not.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Liz squealed loudly and hugged Peter out of excitement which caused Peter to giggle softly, Ned and MJ were just watching the whole scene rolling out knowing that they would be okay with whatever you guys were doing.</p><p>But they were silent because they realised you looking at them, wistfully, they both quietly chuckled understanding what the actual fuck was going on.</p><p>As Liz finally left your lunch table you went back to normal and Ned and MJ started questioning you guys about the whole waltz thing, the so confident Y/N who signed them up for waltz vanished for that whole hour.</p><p>For some reason you felt insecure about it, the waltz thing, Peter you were quite embarrassed talking about it which was not you.</p><p>The whole waltz thing was kind of hard though, as you and Peter went to your first class or practice whatever (which was after school btw and was even more tiring), you knew a little bit of waltz from past experiences and Peter literally knew nothing but he was doing it better than you, you kept getting nervous and blushing and fucking it up.</p><p>For someone who knew how to waltz you were a disaster, plus because your friends were there too you were kind of distracted because focusing on Peter seemed kind of weird to you\u00a0 because you kept blushing.</p><p>As you kept getting distracted and more distracted with talking to Hary.\u00a0 Peter was growing out of his patience, you didn\u2019t realise it would be a problem but boy he was pissed.</p><p>You were supposed to do a little turning move that was easy and everyone except you guys could do it so Peter was frustrated because he really wanted to make this work, hell he even watched videos at home and practiced with May for hours just to not fuck this up but you seemed careless to him and you kept chatting up with this new guy from your Spanish class and he couldn\u2019t take that.</p><p>As the song started and you were just about to do the turning move, your friend started mouthing you something from far away which caused you to get distracted once again making you miss out the move and ruin the whole waltz.\u00a0</p><p>Peter furiously looked into your eyes \u201cY/N can you fucking focus for once?\u201d he said a little loudly. You were shocked by his sudden tone of change\u00a0\u201cPeter.. can you calm down?\u201d you said worriedly and he just shook his head</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying to take this shit serious, can you fucking do that too I know it must be hard for you to spend 5 minutes without talking to a guy but still!\u201d\u00a0you were beyond shocked at what he was implying to\u00a0\u201cWhat the fuck does that mean Parker?\u201d he was trying his best to calm down but it didn\u2019t seem possible so he stormed out. Leaving you alone and frustrated.\u00a0</p><p>MJ and Ned seeing everything came to you after the practice by saying stupid jokes like\u00a0\u201cYou know in relationships you do fight right.\u201d But you just shook them off taking your bags and leaving the practice, as you left school you realised that you were supposed to walk home with Peter because it was really late and Peter didn\u2019t want you walking all alone at dark, but since he popped off for no reason, you mentally cursed yourself and tried walking home in the fastest way possible.</p><p>New York is a safe city, New York is a safe city, New York is a safe city you kept repeating yourself this as you were walking through some dark alleys, you literally felt like those stupid characters in horror movies who would choose the dumbest way and die instantly.</p><p>As you were walking you felt (you know that feeling like when someone is behind you) you felt that and slowly turned around fearing for your life, you saw nothing and a sighed in relief\u00a0\u201cIsn\u2019t it dangerous for a girl like you to hang around this late in a dark alley, do you wish to get yourself killed?\u201d said the superhero as he landed in front of you, you were petrified with his surprise entrance and started punching him in the arm\u00a0\u201cFUUCK! Why would you do that?\u201d she said in a horrified voice.</p><p>\u201cOw! Ow, heyy! What did I do, I am trying to save your ass!\u201d he said rubbing his arm and holding it as if he wasn\u2019t a superhero that handled much painful and stronger hits.</p><p>\u201cIs that how you save people by scaring the shit out of them, Jesus!\u201d she exclaimed and tried to catch her breath. He chuckled quietly\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m sorry, you just seemed scared and it\u2019s dark so I thought I could walk you to your home.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSorry spider-man but how do I know that you\u2019re not some old creep? What am I supposed to do just give you my adress? Do you want my security number too while you\u2019re at it?\u201d Peter was truly offended but then he remembered how he kept the secret from you so he softened.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t want you to walk home on your own, I swear I\u2019m not a creep, please just let me walk you home safely.\u201d you looked up at him admiring him and for some reason you felt like you could trust him.</p><p>After a few tries of him trying to make you accept it you finally gave in and he helped you get home safely,most of the way you walked and chatted he was quite fun to talk with but when both of you got kinda tired from walking he decided to take you by your waist and take you home in a much faster way. Him holding you while shooting webs and screaming\u00a0\u201cWOOO!\u201d was one of the best things that happened to you and considering how shitty your day went this whole thing felt really nice to you.</p><p>As Peter finally dropped you of on home by the window safely, he looked at you one last time and said\u00a0\u201cSee you later, uhm, what\u2019s your name?\u201d he said pretending his best to not know you.\u00a0\u201cUh-, it\u2019s Y/N.\u201d you smiled up at him\u00a0\u201cIt was nice chatting up with you but I\u2019ve gotta a whole city to save, see you later Y/N. \u201d you watched as he kept shooting webs and screaming\u00a0\u201cWOOO!\u201d once again making you giggle.\u00a0\u201cSee you later,spidey.\u201d</p><p>You were so tired. so tired. You could barely get yourself to put your pajamas on and you huffed falling down on your bed, falling asleep wasn\u2019t going to be hard you thought, but then all of a sudden you started thinking about Spiderman.</p><p>How he was supposed to be this big mighty hero he indeed was a hero but he was also a dork, a big one and was really cute.</p><p>\u201cPeter is gonna flip when I tell him about how I saw Spiderman yesterday.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>You thought and smirked to yourself as you knew how jealous Peter -also let\u2019s not forget Ned- was going to be when they realized you met the big hero, more importantly the mighty hero walked you home.</p><p>Then it hit you, you were supposed to be mad at Peter,\u00a0he was weird and extremely angry today for no reason, and you remember how much at that moment he irritated you, then\u00a0 you huffed once again at the thought of seeing Peter tomorrow and tried to put off your thoughts about it all at once and went to sleep.</p>",

Leaving you alone and frustrated.&nbsp;</p><p>MJ and Ned seeing everything came to you after the practice by saying stupid jokes like&nbsp;&ldquo;You know in relationships you do fight right.&rdquo; But you just shook them off taking your bags and leaving the practice, as you left school you realised that you were supposed to walk home with Peter because it was really late and Peter didn&rsquo;t want you walking all alone at dark, but since he popped off for no reason, you mentally cursed yourself and tried walking home in the fastest way possible.</p><p>New York is a safe city, New York is a safe city, New York is a safe city you kept repeating yourself this as you were walking through some dark alleys, you literally felt like those stupid characters in horror movies who would choose the dumbest way and die instantly.</p><p>As you were walking you felt (you know that feeling like when someone is behind you) you felt that and slowly turned around fearing for your life, you saw nothing and a sighed in relief&nbsp;&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it dangerous for a girl like you to hang around this late in a dark alley, do you wish to get yourself killed?&rdquo; said the superhero as he landed in front of you, you were petrified with his surprise entrance and started punching him in the arm&nbsp;&ldquo;FUUCK! Why would you do that?&rdquo; she said in a horrified voice.</p><p>&ldquo;Ow! Ow, heyy! What did I do, I am trying to save your ass!&rdquo; he said rubbing his arm and holding it as if he wasn&rsquo;t a superhero that handled much painful and stronger hits.</p><p>&ldquo;Is that how you save people by scaring the shit out of them, Jesus!&rdquo; she exclaimed and tried to catch her breath. He chuckled quietly&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, you just seemed scared and it&rsquo;s dark so I thought I could walk you to your home.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Sorry spider-man but how do I know that you&rsquo;re not some old creep? What am I supposed to do just give you my adress? Do you want my security number too while you&rsquo;re at it?&rdquo; Peter was truly offended but then he remembered how he kept the secret from you so he softened.</p><p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t want you to walk home on your own, I swear I&rsquo;m not a creep, please just let me walk you home safely.&rdquo; you looked up at him admiring him and for some reason you felt like you could trust him.</p><p>After a few tries of him trying to make you accept it you finally gave in and he helped you get home safely,most of the way you walked and chatted he was quite fun to talk with but when both of you got kinda tired from walking he decided to take you by your waist and take you home in a much faster way. Him holding you while shooting webs and screaming&nbsp;&ldquo;WOOO!&rdquo; was one of the best things that happened to you and considering how shitty your day went this whole thing felt really nice to you.</p><p>As Peter finally dropped you of on home by the window safely, he looked at you one last time and said&nbsp;&ldquo;See you later, uhm, what&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo; he said pretending his best to not know you.&nbsp;&ldquo;Uh-, it&rsquo;s Y/N.&rdquo; you smiled up at him&nbsp;&ldquo;It was nice chatting up with you but I&rsquo;ve gotta a whole city to save, see you later Y/N. &rdquo; you watched as he kept shooting webs and screaming&nbsp;&ldquo;WOOO!&rdquo; once again making you giggle.&nbsp;&ldquo;See you later,spidey.&rdquo;</p><p>You were so tired. so tired. You could barely get yourself to put your pajamas on and you huffed falling down on your bed, falling asleep wasn&rsquo;t going to be hard you thought, but then all of a sudden you started thinking about Spiderman.</p><p>How he was supposed to be this big mighty hero he indeed was a hero but he was also a dork, a big one and was really cute.</p><p>&ldquo;Peter is gonna flip when I tell him about how I saw Spiderman yesterday.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>You thought and smirked to yourself as you knew how jealous Peter -also let&rsquo;s not forget Ned- was going to be when they realized you met the big hero, more importantly the mighty hero walked you home.</p><p>Then it hit you, you were supposed to be mad at Peter,&nbsp;he was weird and extremely angry today for no reason, and you remember how much at that moment he irritated you, then&nbsp; you huffed once again at the thought of seeing Peter tomorrow and tried to put off your thoughts about it all at once and went to sleep.</p>",
