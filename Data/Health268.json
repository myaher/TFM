        "body": "Ryan and I loaded up Ryan\u2019s car with waaay too much stuff and headed off to Atlanta on Thursday afternoon for a family trip with our boys! We planned a rather last-minute getaway for our crew because Ryan and I were dying to take Chase to the Georgia Aquarium to see whale sharks.\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_0800-2.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-83527\" src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_0800-2-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"Georgia Aquarium Whale Sharks\" width=\"577\" height=\"432\" srcset=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_0800-2-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_0800-2-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_0800-2-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_0800-2.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 577px) 100vw, 577px\"/></a></p>\n<p>To say Chase is obsessed with whales, sharks, dolphins and basically any form of marine life would be a serious understatement and he absolutely lit up when we told him our plans for the weekend. I booked us a hotel room within walking distance of the aquarium (we stayed at Aloft Atlanta Downtown and thought the location was great) and we checked in with an embarrassing amount of luggage for such a short stay.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_2459.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-83528\" src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_2459-820x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"382\" height=\"476\" srcset=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_2459-820x1024.jpg 820w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_2459-240x300.jpg 240w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_2459-768x959.jpg 768w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_2459.jpg 1281w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 382px) 100vw, 382px\"/></a></p>\n<p>With this being our first trip as a family of four, it was also a bit of a learning experience for us. We opted to stay in one room which Chase thought was the coolest \u2014 SLEEPOVER! \u2014 but there were definitely pros and cons to the set up.</p>\n<p>The pros mainly centered around the novelty of a family sleepover (it was adorable to see how excited Chase was to share a bed) and feeling Chase\u2019s sweet little arm loop around mine as we cuddled up melted my heart. The cons, as I am sure you can imagine, all related to sleep. <a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/chase-update-three-years-old/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Chase is still napping</a> (most days) but naps didn\u2019t happen at all on this trip because he was way too amped to sleep when Mom, Dad and Ryder were in the same room. This resulted in a very, very fussy child by the end of the day. It also meant that on the second day, we had lights out and our whole family in bed \u201csleeping\u201d a little before 8 p.m. (Thank goodness for my Kindle!)</p>\n<p>Ryan and I agreed we would have our family of four stay in one room together for a super-short trip somewhere but for anything longer than a night or two, I think opting for a VRBO-style rental or a suite-style room where our family can be separated for sleep would be better for everyone, at least at this point in our lives while we have a midday napper in the family.</p>\n<p>Anyway\u2026 back to the trip!</p>\n<h4>Friday</h4>\n<p>Our first full day in Atlanta kicked off with coffee and muffins from Cafe Lucia and some playtime at Centennial Park located right across the street from the aquarium.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_2497.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-83529\" src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_2497-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"369\" height=\"492\" srcset=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_2497-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_2497-225x300.jpg 225w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_2497.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 369px) 100vw, 369px\"/></a></p>\n<p>We actually visited the park on Thursday night after our arrival since it was such a short walk from our hotel and Chase loved it!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_2527.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-83531\" src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_2527-696x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"363\" height=\"534\" srcset=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_2527-696x1024.jpg 696w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_2527-204x300.jpg 204w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_2527-768x1130.jpg 768w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_2527.jpg 1087w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 363px) 100vw, 363px\"/></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_2500.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-83530\" src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_2500-776x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"408\" height=\"539\" srcset=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_2500-776x1024.jpg 776w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_2500-227x300.jpg 227w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_2500-768x1013.jpg 768w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_2500.jpg 1213w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 408px) 100vw, 408px\"/></a>(<em><a href=\"http://bit.ly/2BNwcCO\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Overalls</a>\u00a0\u2014 Ridiculously comfy and less than $20!

We took advantage of the stroller check almost immediately and I wore Ryder in my baby carrier as we made our way to the Ocean Voyager exhibit to see the whale sharks, manta rays, a goliath grouper, green sea turtle and more.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_0795.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-83526\" src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_0795-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"506\" height=\"380\" srcset=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_0795-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_0795-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_0795-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_0795.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 506px) 100vw, 506px\"/></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_2540.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-83533\" src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_2540-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"367\" height=\"489\" srcset=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_2540-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_2540-225x300.jpg 225w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_2540.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 367px) 100vw, 367px\"/></a></p>\n<p>Ryan and I actually went <a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/scuba-diving-with-whale-sharks/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">scuba diving with the whale sharks</a> at the Georgia Aquarium several years ago for my birthday and it was incredible so returning to the exhibit with our two boys seven years later was really neat! We spent hours at the aquarium and absolutely loved the various exhibits and observing life under the sea. Ryder stayed snuggled up against me for most of our visit but had fun kicking and playing when he was awake and we hung out in front of the giant aquarium wall of the Ocean Voyager exhibit.</p>\n<p>Watching Chase at the aquarium was a highlight for sure and he had the BEST time trying to find various animals in the tanks and pointing them out to us. (He also blew us away when he identified the goliath grouper before we even told him what it was or pointed it out to him. I think we may have another scuba diver in our family!)</p>\n<p>After our time at the aquarium, we walked back to our hotel room and crossed our fingers for a nap for Chase. Once it became glaringly obvious that was not going to happen, we threw in the towel and decided to head out on our next adventure.</p>\n<p>We made our way to Ponce City Market which I remembered loving from my <a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/a-weekend-in-atlanta/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">last trip to Atlanta</a> and grabbed slushies and popsicles from King of Pops while we wandered around.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_2551.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-83534\" src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_2551-1009x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"556\" height=\"565\" srcset=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_2551-1009x1024.jpg 1009w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_2551-295x300.jpg 295w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_2551-768x780.jpg 768w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_2551.jpg 1507w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 556px) 100vw, 556px\"/></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_2742.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-83544\" src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_2742-824x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"397\" height=\"494\" srcset=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_2742-824x1024.jpg 824w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_2742-241x300.jpg 241w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_2742-768x954.jpg 768w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_2742.jpg 1030w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 397px) 100vw, 397px\"/></a></p>\n<p>Eventually we walked across the street to Historic Fourth Ward Park so Chase could play with Ryan on the jungle gym while I nursed Ryder.

We easily could\u2019ve spent an entire day at the park and if we make our way back to Atlanta in the near future we\u2019ll absolutely budget more time there. Such a fun spot!</p>\n<p>We intentionally kept the rest of our time in Atlanta rather low key. We opted to hang our by our hotel\u2019s pool and relax a bit before packing up and making our way back to Charlotte.</p>\n<p>During our drive back home, Ryder and Chase shocked us by falling asleep at the same time (huge win and further proof Chase needed his missed naps) so Ryan and I joked that we felt like we got a mini car date and played the question game which is an old favorite of ours! We always have fun posing a variety of questions to each other ranging from serious to completely random. I definitely didn\u2019t anticipate loving part of a long car ride back home so much but it was a really nice way to end our long weekend away!</p>\n<p>This week feels like our last full week of summer since Chase officially starts preschool again next week! We had his orientation late yesterday afternoon and I already love his teacher for the year. I know things will be a little chaotic over here this week as we gear up for the school year and all that, but I hope to have the chance to check in a few times. Thanks so much for stopping by the blog today!</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/first-family-trip-with-two/\">First Family Trip with Two</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com\">Peanut Butter Fingers</a>.</p><br/><br/>\nfrom Health &amp; Wellness <a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/first-family-trip-with-two/\">https://www.pbfingers.com/first-family-trip-with-two/</a><br/>\nvia <a href=\"http://www.rssmix.com/\">http://www.rssmix.com/</a>",

We planned a rather last-minute getaway for our crew because Ryan and I were dying to take Chase to the Georgia Aquarium to see whale sharks.\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_0800-2.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-83527\" src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_0800-2-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"Georgia Aquarium Whale Sharks\" width=\"577\" height=\"432\" srcset=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_0800-2-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_0800-2-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_0800-2-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_0800-2.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 577px) 100vw, 577px\"></a></p>\n<p>To say Chase is obsessed with whales, sharks, dolphins and basically any form of marine life would be a serious understatement and he absolutely lit up when we told him our plans for the weekend. I booked us a hotel room within walking distance of the aquarium (we stayed at Aloft Atlanta Downtown and thought the location was great) and we checked in with an embarrassing amount of luggage for such a short stay.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_2459.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-83528\" src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_2459-820x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"382\" height=\"476\" srcset=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_2459-820x1024.jpg 820w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_2459-240x300.jpg 240w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_2459-768x959.jpg 768w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_2459.jpg 1281w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 382px) 100vw, 382px\"></a></p>\n<p>With this being our first trip as a family of four, it was also a bit of a learning experience for us. We opted to stay in one room which Chase thought was the coolest \u2014 SLEEPOVER! \u2014 but there were definitely pros and cons to the set up.</p>\n<p>The pros mainly centered around the novelty of a family sleepover (it was adorable to see how excited Chase was to share a bed) and feeling Chase\u2019s sweet little arm loop around mine as we cuddled up melted my heart. The cons, as I am sure you can imagine, all related to sleep. <a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/chase-update-three-years-old/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Chase is still napping</a> (most days) but naps didn\u2019t happen at all on this trip because he was way too amped to sleep when Mom, Dad and Ryder were in the same room. This resulted in a very, very fussy child by the end of the day. It also meant that on the second day, we had lights out and our whole family in bed \u201csleeping\u201d a little before 8 p.m. (Thank goodness for my Kindle!)</p>\n<p>Ryan and I agreed we would have our family of four stay in one room together for a super-short trip somewhere but for anything longer than a night or two, I think opting for a VRBO-style rental or a suite-style room where our family can be separated for sleep would be better for everyone, at least at this point in our lives while we have a midday napper in the family.</p>\n<p>Anyway\u2026 back to the trip!</p>\n<h4>Friday</h4>\n<p>Our first full day in Atlanta kicked off with coffee and muffins from Cafe Lucia and some playtime at Centennial Park located right across the street from the aquarium.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_2497.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-83529\" src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_2497-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"369\" height=\"492\" srcset=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_2497-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_2497-225x300.jpg 225w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_2497.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 369px) 100vw, 369px\"></a></p>\n<p>We actually visited the park on Thursday night after our arrival since it was such a short walk from our hotel and Chase loved it!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_2527.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-83531\" src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_2527-696x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"363\" height=\"534\" srcset=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_2527-696x1024.jpg 696w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_2527-204x300.jpg 204w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_2527-768x1130.jpg 768w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_2527.jpg 1087w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 363px) 100vw, 363px\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_2500.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-83530\" src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_2500-776x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"408\" height=\"539\" srcset=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_2500-776x1024.jpg 776w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_2500-227x300.jpg 227w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_2500-768x1013.jpg 768w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_2500.jpg 1213w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 408px) 100vw, 408px\"></a>(<em><a href=\"http://bit.ly/2BNwcCO\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Overalls</a>\u00a0\u2014 Ridiculously comfy and less than $20!

We spent hours at the aquarium and absolutely loved the various exhibits and observing life under the sea. Ryder stayed snuggled up against me for most of our visit but had fun kicking and playing when he was awake and we hung out in front of the giant aquarium wall of the Ocean Voyager exhibit.</p>\n<p>Watching Chase at the aquarium was a highlight for sure and he had the BEST time trying to find various animals in the tanks and pointing them out to us. (He also blew us away when he identified the goliath grouper before we even told him what it was or pointed it out to him. I think we may have another scuba diver in our family!)</p>\n<p>After our time at the aquarium, we walked back to our hotel room and crossed our fingers for a nap for Chase. Once it became glaringly obvious that was not going to happen, we threw in the towel and decided to head out on our next adventure.</p>\n<p>We made our way to Ponce City Market which I remembered loving from my <a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/a-weekend-in-atlanta/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">last trip to Atlanta</a> and grabbed slushies and popsicles from King of Pops while we wandered around.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_2551.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-83534\" src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_2551-1009x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"556\" height=\"565\" srcset=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_2551-1009x1024.jpg 1009w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_2551-295x300.jpg 295w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_2551-768x780.jpg 768w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_2551.jpg 1507w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 556px) 100vw, 556px\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_2742.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-83544\" src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_2742-824x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"397\" height=\"494\" srcset=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_2742-824x1024.jpg 824w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_2742-241x300.jpg 241w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_2742-768x954.jpg 768w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_2742.jpg 1030w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 397px) 100vw, 397px\"></a></p>\n<p>Eventually we walked across the street to Historic Fourth Ward Park so Chase could play with Ryan on the jungle gym while I nursed Ryder.

We easily could\u2019ve spent an entire day at the park and if we make our way back to Atlanta in the near future we\u2019ll absolutely budget more time there. Such a fun spot!</p>\n<p>We intentionally kept the rest of our time in Atlanta rather low key. We opted to hang our by our hotel\u2019s pool and relax a bit before packing up and making our way back to Charlotte.</p>\n<p>During our drive back home, Ryder and Chase shocked us by falling asleep at the same time (huge win and further proof Chase needed his missed naps) so Ryan and I joked that we felt like we got a mini car date and played the question game which is an old favorite of ours! We always have fun posing a variety of questions to each other ranging from serious to completely random. I definitely didn\u2019t anticipate loving part of a long car ride back home so much but it was a really nice way to end our long weekend away!</p>\n<p>This week feels like our last full week of summer since Chase officially starts preschool again next week! We had his orientation late yesterday afternoon and I already love his teacher for the year. I know things will be a little chaotic over here this week as we gear up for the school year and all that, but I hope to have the chance to check in a few times.

We planned a rather last-minute getaway for our crew because Ryan and I were dying to take Chase to the Georgia Aquarium to see whale sharks.\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_0800-2.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-83527\" src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_0800-2-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"Georgia Aquarium Whale Sharks\" width=\"577\" height=\"432\" srcset=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_0800-2-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_0800-2-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_0800-2-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_0800-2.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 577px) 100vw, 577px\"></a></p>\n<p>To say Chase is obsessed with whales, sharks, dolphins and basically any form of marine life would be a serious understatement and he absolutely lit up when we told him our plans for the weekend. I booked us a hotel room within walking distance of the aquarium (we stayed at Aloft Atlanta Downtown and thought the location was great) and we checked in with an embarrassing amount of luggage for such a short stay.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_2459.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-83528\" src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_2459-820x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"382\" height=\"476\" srcset=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_2459-820x1024.jpg 820w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_2459-240x300.jpg 240w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_2459-768x959.jpg 768w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_2459.jpg 1281w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 382px) 100vw, 382px\"></a></p>\n<p>With this being our first trip as a family of four, it was also a bit of a learning experience for us. We opted to stay in one room which Chase thought was the coolest \u2014 SLEEPOVER! \u2014 but there were definitely pros and cons to the set up.</p>\n<p>The pros mainly centered around the novelty of a family sleepover (it was adorable to see how excited Chase was to share a bed) and feeling Chase\u2019s sweet little arm loop around mine as we cuddled up melted my heart. The cons, as I am sure you can imagine, all related to sleep. <a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/chase-update-three-years-old/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Chase is still napping</a> (most days) but naps didn\u2019t happen at all on this trip because he was way too amped to sleep when Mom, Dad and Ryder were in the same room. This resulted in a very, very fussy child by the end of the day. It also meant that on the second day, we had lights out and our whole family in bed \u201csleeping\u201d a little before 8 p.m. (Thank goodness for my Kindle!)</p>\n<p>Ryan and I agreed we would have our family of four stay in one room together for a super-short trip somewhere but for anything longer than a night or two, I think opting for a VRBO-style rental or a suite-style room where our family can be separated for sleep would be better for everyone, at least at this point in our lives while we have a midday napper in the family.</p>\n<p>Anyway\u2026 back to the trip!</p>\n<h4>Friday</h4>\n<p>Our first full day in Atlanta kicked off with coffee and muffins from Cafe Lucia and some playtime at Centennial Park located right across the street from the aquarium.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_2497.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-83529\" src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_2497-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"369\" height=\"492\" srcset=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_2497-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_2497-225x300.jpg 225w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_2497.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 369px) 100vw, 369px\"></a></p>\n<p>We actually visited the park on Thursday night after our arrival since it was such a short walk from our hotel and Chase loved it!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_2527.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-83531\" src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_2527-696x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"363\" height=\"534\" srcset=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_2527-696x1024.jpg 696w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_2527-204x300.jpg 204w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_2527-768x1130.jpg 768w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_2527.jpg 1087w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 363px) 100vw, 363px\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_2500.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-83530\" src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_2500-776x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"408\" height=\"539\" srcset=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_2500-776x1024.jpg 776w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_2500-227x300.jpg 227w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_2500-768x1013.jpg 768w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_2500.jpg 1213w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 408px) 100vw, 408px\"></a>(<em><a href=\"http://bit.ly/2BNwcCO\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Overalls</a>\u00a0\u2014 Ridiculously comfy and less than $20!

We spent hours at the aquarium and absolutely loved the various exhibits and observing life under the sea. Ryder stayed snuggled up against me for most of our visit but had fun kicking and playing when he was awake and we hung out in front of the giant aquarium wall of the Ocean Voyager exhibit.</p>\n<p>Watching Chase at the aquarium was a highlight for sure and he had the BEST time trying to find various animals in the tanks and pointing them out to us. (He also blew us away when he identified the goliath grouper before we even told him what it was or pointed it out to him. I think we may have another scuba diver in our family!)</p>\n<p>After our time at the aquarium, we walked back to our hotel room and crossed our fingers for a nap for Chase. Once it became glaringly obvious that was not going to happen, we threw in the towel and decided to head out on our next adventure.</p>\n<p>We made our way to Ponce City Market which I remembered loving from my <a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/a-weekend-in-atlanta/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">last trip to Atlanta</a> and grabbed slushies and popsicles from King of Pops while we wandered around.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_2551.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-83534\" src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_2551-1009x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"556\" height=\"565\" srcset=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_2551-1009x1024.jpg 1009w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_2551-295x300.jpg 295w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_2551-768x780.jpg 768w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_2551.jpg 1507w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 556px) 100vw, 556px\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_2742.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-83544\" src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_2742-824x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"397\" height=\"494\" srcset=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_2742-824x1024.jpg 824w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_2742-241x300.jpg 241w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_2742-768x954.jpg 768w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_2742.jpg 1030w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 397px) 100vw, 397px\"></a></p>\n<p>Eventually we walked across the street to Historic Fourth Ward Park so Chase could play with Ryan on the jungle gym while I nursed Ryder.

                "content": "<p><p>Ryan and I loaded up Ryan&rsquo;s car with waaay too much stuff and headed off to Atlanta on Thursday afternoon for a family trip with our boys! We planned a rather last-minute getaway for our crew because Ryan and I were dying to take Chase to the Georgia Aquarium to see whale sharks.\n</p><p><div class=\"external-image-wrapper\" data-loading-text=\"Loading...\" data-src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_0800-2-1024x768.jpg\">External image</div></p>\n<p>To say Chase is obsessed with whales, sharks, dolphins and basically any form of marine life would be a serious understatement and he absolutely lit up when we told him our plans for the weekend. I booked us a hotel room within walking distance of the aquarium (we stayed at Aloft Atlanta Downtown and thought the location was great) and we checked in with an embarrassing amount of luggage for such a short stay.</p>\n<p><div class=\"external-image-wrapper\" data-loading-text=\"Loading...\" data-src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_2459-820x1024.jpg\">External image</div></p>\n<p>With this being our first trip as a family of four, it was also a bit of a learning experience for us. We opted to stay in one room which Chase thought was the coolest &mdash; SLEEPOVER! &mdash; but there were definitely pros and cons to the set up.</p>\n<p>The pros mainly centered around the novelty of a family sleepover (it was adorable to see how excited Chase was to share a bed) and feeling Chase&rsquo;s sweet little arm loop around mine as we cuddled up melted my heart. The cons, as I am sure you can imagine, all related to sleep. <a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/chase-update-three-years-old/\" target=\"_blank\">Chase is still napping</a> (most days) but naps didn&rsquo;t happen at all on this trip because he was way too amped to sleep when Mom, Dad and Ryder were in the same room. This resulted in a very, very fussy child by the end of the day. It also meant that on the second day, we had lights out and our whole family in bed &ldquo;sleeping&rdquo; a little before 8 p.m. (Thank goodness for my Kindle!)</p>\n<p>Ryan and I agreed we would have our family of four stay in one room together for a super-short trip somewhere but for anything longer than a night or two, I think opting for a VRBO-style rental or a suite-style room where our family can be separated for sleep would be better for everyone, at least at this point in our lives while we have a midday napper in the family.</p>\n<p>Anyway&hellip; back to the trip!</p>\n<h4>Friday</h4>\n<p>Our first full day in Atlanta kicked off with coffee and muffins from Cafe Lucia and some playtime at Centennial Park located right across the street from the aquarium.</p>\n<p><div class=\"external-image-wrapper\" data-loading-text=\"Loading...\" data-src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_2497-768x1024.jpg\">External image</div></p>\n<p>We actually visited the park on Thursday night after our arrival since it was such a short walk from our hotel and Chase loved it!</p>\n<p><div class=\"external-image-wrapper\" data-loading-text=\"Loading...\" data-src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_2527-696x1024.jpg\">External image</div></p>\n<p><div class=\"external-image-wrapper\" data-loading-text=\"Loading...\" data-src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_2500-776x1024.jpg\">External image</div>(<em><a href=\"http://bit.ly/2BNwcCO\" target=\"_blank\">Overalls</a>&nbsp;&mdash; Ridiculously comfy and less than $20!

We took advantage of the stroller check almost immediately and I wore Ryder in my baby carrier as we made our way to the Ocean Voyager exhibit to see the whale sharks, manta rays, a goliath grouper, green sea turtle and more.</p>\n<p><div class=\"external-image-wrapper\" data-loading-text=\"Loading...\" data-src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_0795-1024x768.jpg\">External image</div></p>\n<p><div class=\"external-image-wrapper\" data-loading-text=\"Loading...\" data-src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_2540-768x1024.jpg\">External image</div></p>\n<p>Ryan and I actually went <a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/scuba-diving-with-whale-sharks/\" target=\"_blank\">scuba diving with the whale sharks</a> at the Georgia Aquarium several years ago for my birthday and it was incredible so returning to the exhibit with our two boys seven years later was really neat! We spent hours at the aquarium and absolutely loved the various exhibits and observing life under the sea. Ryder stayed snuggled up against me for most of our visit but had fun kicking and playing when he was awake and we hung out in front of the giant aquarium wall of the Ocean Voyager exhibit.</p>\n<p>Watching Chase at the aquarium was a highlight for sure and he had the BEST time trying to find various animals in the tanks and pointing them out to us. (He also blew us away when he identified the goliath grouper before we even told him what it was or pointed it out to him. I think we may have another scuba diver in our family!)</p>\n<p>After our time at the aquarium, we walked back to our hotel room and crossed our fingers for a nap for Chase. Once it became glaringly obvious that was not going to happen, we threw in the towel and decided to head out on our next adventure.</p>\n<p>We made our way to Ponce City Market which I remembered loving from my <a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/a-weekend-in-atlanta/\" target=\"_blank\">last trip to Atlanta</a> and grabbed slushies and popsicles from King of Pops while we wandered around.</p>\n<p><div class=\"external-image-wrapper\" data-loading-text=\"Loading...\" data-src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_2551-1009x1024.jpg\">External image</div></p>\n<p><div class=\"external-image-wrapper\" data-loading-text=\"Loading...\" data-src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_2742-824x1024.jpg\">External image</div></p>\n<p>Eventually we walked across the street to Historic Fourth Ward Park so Chase could play with Ryan on the jungle gym while I nursed Ryder. It was a great little park with a splash pad and plenty of room to run around which we all loved.</p>\n<p><div class=\"external-image-wrapper\" data-loading-text=\"Loading...\" data-src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_2599-768x1024.jpg\">External image</div></p>\n<p>With a very full day and no nap under his belt, Chase clearly needed an early bedtime, so we scrapped all plans for dinner out and picked up a pizza to bring back to our room before settling in for the night.</p>\n<h4>Saturday</h4>\n<p>The black out curtains in our hotel room worked wonders because we all ended up sleeping in until almost 8 a.m. on Saturday morning! (I was up in the night with Ryder but he thankfully went back to sleep pretty well.) We had plans to arrive at Zoo Atlanta around 10 a.m. and eased into the morning in our hotel room before popping into Grant Park Coffeehouse for breakfast.</p>\n<p>The zoo was bustlin&rsquo; on Saturday but we made the most of our visit despite the crowds.

This disorder cannot be cured, but its symptoms can be treated when diagnosed in time and with regular medications and lifestyle changes.</p><h2>Link Between Tiredness During Mid-Day And Diabetes</h2><p>As we read earlier, when a person is suffering from diabetes, their blood sugar levels will be abnormally high, triggering a number of symptoms linked to the disorder.

There have to be at least a couple more symptoms of diabetes experienced, along with mid-day fatigue, to let a person know that it is time to get tested for diabetes.</p><p>Below are some of the other symptoms of diabetes to look out for, along with the mid-day fatigue symptom, to help diagnose the disorder:</p><p>&bull; Excessive thirst</p><p>&bull; Frequent urge to urinate</p><p>&bull; Sudden, unexpected weight loss</p><p>&bull; Blurred vision</p><p>&bull; Appetite fluctuations</p><p>&bull; Lowered immunity</p><p>&bull; Slow wound-healing capacity</p><p>&bull; Slow disease-healing capacity</p><p>&bull; Lowered metabolism</p><p>&bull; Irritability</p><p>&bull; Itchy skin</p><p>&bull; Frequent yeast infections</p><p>&bull; Gum swelling and gum receding</p><p>&bull; Frequent gum infections</p><p>&bull; Sexual dysfunction and loss of libido, especially among men</p><p>&bull; Numbness and tingling sensation in the hands and feet</p><p>&bull; Gastritis</p><h2>What To Do If Diagnosed With Diabetes?</h2><p>After getting yourself checked, when you notice that you have a few of the above-mentioned symptoms of diabetes, along with the mid-day fatigue symptoms, doctors will immediately start medications that can help keep the blood sugar levels under control and therefore help keep the symptoms at bay.</p><p>In addition, you will also be advised to make certain lifestyle changes, which can help keep diabetes symptoms under control, such as the following:</p><p>&bull; Consuming a healthy diet, devoid of any sugar or glucose content.</p><p>&bull; Exercising moderately on a daily basis and trying to maintain a healthy weight.</p><p>&bull; Quit vices such as smoking and excessive drinking.</p><p>&bull; Ensure that your blood pressure and cholesterol levels are under control.</p><p>&bull; Consume minimal amounts of carbohydrate and fats.</p><p>&bull; Take the medications regularly and consume natural, diabetes-friendly juices, without sugar, to beat the tiredness and other symptoms.</p><p>Also Read:</p><p><a href=\"https://www.boldsky.com/pregnancy-parenting/prenatal/2018/ten-signs-you-might-be-pregnant-and-you-are-not-aware-of-it-121122.html\">10 Signs You Might Be Pregnant And You Are Not Aware Of It</a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.boldsky.com/health/diet-fitness/2018/amazing-health-benefits-of-superfood-kale-125159.html\">All You Need To Know About The Superfood, Kale</a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.boldsky.com/beauty/2018/ever-tried-these-one-minute-beauty-tips-125194.html\">Ever tried these one-minute beauty tips?</a></p>",
