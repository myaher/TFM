You knew it wasn&rsquo;t going to be easy, being that half your lives were dedicated to S.H.I.E.L.D. and the Avengers, but you had faith you could make it work. You expected to be stretched thin on days where you were under immense world saving levels of stress, but it was on days when you and Clint found downtime with the other Avengers that you had to remind yourself to stay calm at all times. </p><p>The men on the team were absolute children. You couldn&rsquo;t get through a normal day without at least two of them bickering over something competent adults would normally ignore, and you were the unfortunate witness to the first squabble of the day. </p><p>&ldquo;STOP INTERRUPTING ME!&rdquo; Tony shouted at Clint, who was insisting he hadn&rsquo;t broken the coffee machine. Tony was always on edge beneath the sarcastic facade, but when he didn&rsquo;t have his coffee, it was a whole other story. </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not my fault you can&rsquo;t build a good Keurig knockoff!&rdquo; Clint snapped at him. </p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t wait for retirement,&rdquo; you muttered as you rubbed your temples. It was too early in the morning for this. </p><p>&ldquo;I HAVE FIVE BUSINESS MEETINGS TODAY, ROBIN HOOD!&rdquo; Tony was still yelling. </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not going to show up to any of them!&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;THAT&rsquo;S BESIDES THE POINT!&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Calm down, boys,&rdquo; you said, finally deciding it was a good time to try and deescalate the situation. You went over to the coffee machine and started checking all the possible things that could keep it from working. It was plugged in. It had enough water. What could be wrong with it? </p><p>You lifted the tab where the little coffee ground insert would go, and you sighed in disappointment at your coworkers. </p><p>&ldquo;Tony, you never put the coffee in,&rdquo; you told him. His angry expression turned to one of embarrassment, and he rubbed the back of his neck in shame. </p><p>&ldquo;I knew that,&rdquo; he said as you put in the coffee grounds for him. </p><p>&ldquo;Sure you did.&rdquo; You finished making his coffee and handed him his mug. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re welcome.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; he said sheepishly, and headed out of the kitchen towards his lab. </p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be alarmed,&rdquo; Clint said as he embraced you from behind. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to kiss you.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I think I deserve more than that for diffusing another fight with Tony,&rdquo; you said as he pressed soft kisses to your neck. </p><p>&ldquo;What did you have in mind?&rdquo; he asked. </p><p>&ldquo;Breakfast in bed sounds nice.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Anything you want, baby,&rdquo; he said, already at the stove.

Every\ntime I closed my eyes, I was thrown into a weird vision again, including the\none my mysterious wound had triggered. It was always the same five settings,\nand yet, I still had no idea what they were.</p><p>\nIt was like they were right out of reach. Every time I tried to cross the fog\nto discover what it was about, I was pulled out of my sleep. All I could get\nwere five strong, different emotions proper to each vision. Joy, sorrow, renew,\npain, and urgency. Oh, and one, single name.<br/><br/>\nBucky.</p><!-- more --><p>It wasn\u2019t a coincidence, and I knew it. But when I tried to see this through\nwhile awake, it would hurt my head, like I wasn\u2019t supposed to access it despite\nthe little part of me that pushed restlessly for it.</p><p><i>\u201cI know you didn\u2019t want that for her\u201d</i></p><p>Those words were replaying in loop in my head, and\nI couldn\u2019t help but link them to my vision. I hadn\u2019t twitched yesterday, but I\ncertainly picked up on it. What did he mean by that? Was it true that I knew\nthem before? Was Stark right?<br/><br/>\nI hadn\u2019t been called yet this morning, so I was left even more pondering about\nthat. I was sitting on the edge of my stall, my weapons strapped on me, ready\nto go.<br/><br/>\nI had to think about it however for my screen to light up with Jonathan\u2019s face\non it.<br/><br/>\n&ldquo;Soldier&rdquo; He greeted. &ldquo;Barnes is coming, fast. And he\u2019s not\nalone&rdquo;<br/><br/>\nI stood up and straightened my back. &ldquo;What do you need me to do?&rdquo; I\nasked.<br/><br/>\n&ldquo;Go to the second basement and wait for him&rdquo; He ordered. &ldquo;I know\nStark will have had the building scanned and will instruct Barnes to go find\nyou there&rdquo;<br/><br/>\n&ldquo;And then?&rdquo; I raised an eyebrow. &ldquo;What do I do with him? Do I\nattack?&rdquo;<br/><br/>\n&ldquo;You stall him until I can\u2019t get down there&rdquo; He replied.<br/><br/>\n\u201cCopy\u201d<br/><br/>\nI grabbed my assault rifle and made sure my favourite blade was in my utility\nbelt holster. I was already in the first basement, so I only walked the few\nfeet separating me from the staircase and got one floor down. It was a wide,\nempty hangar with a few garages in them.<br/><br/>\nI went to the one that could be closed with enforced steel doors and waited for\nsome company to arrive, gun in hand, ready to shoot. I had no idea what to\nexpect from that famous Sergeant Barnes, even if Jonathan told me he wouldn\u2019t\nhurt me. I chased every doubt I had and focused on the mission at hand. I\ncouldn\u2019t afford another failure.<br/><br/>\nI didn\u2019t have to wonder what would happen for too long, because footsteps were\nsuddenly coming my way. There was only one person coming, however. It must be him.\nThe metal arm gave the man\u2019s identity away when he stepped in the garage.<br/><br/>\nBarnes stopped when he saw me, like he couldn\u2019t believe what he was seeing. He\njogged toward me, and my eyes widened. It wasn\u2019t fear, not even after I\u2019ve\nheard of everything he\u2019s done. It was the wave of familiarity that hit me upon\nseeing him. I knew that man, and I couldn\u2019t stop the name from escaping my\nlips.<br/><br/>\n&ldquo;Bucky?&rdquo;</p><p>It was muffled and distorted, but he had heard,\nhalting his steps.</p><p>\n&ldquo;Dawn&rdquo; He breathed, like he was taken aback. He took several more steps\nforward, but still left a safe distance between us.<br/><br/>\nI had no idea why I knew he was Bucky, or why him calling me Dawn felt right.\nImages tugged at the corner of my mind and tried to come out, but it only\ncreated chaos in my head.<br/><br/>\n&ldquo;Why do I know you?&rdquo; I frowned, trying to get a grip on myself. I was\ngetting frustrated with these dead ends.<br/><br/>\n&ldquo;You saved me from Hydra, do you remember?&rdquo; He asked tentatively,\ntaking one more step forward. &ldquo;Stopped them from taking me back&rdquo;<br/><br/>\nMy knees buckled when images flew past the fog and flashed in my vision. Images\nof fighting, kicking off a pod from a metal arm, flipping a bike into black\nclad agents. I had been desperate to get him out of there.</p><p>I lifted my gun and he held up his hands in\nsurrender. I had to get my head back in the task.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t wanna do this\u201d He warned.</p><p>\u201cI do actually\u201d I threw my gun on the ground and\nclosed the distance. I threw a punch, but he saw me coming and dodged it. I\nthen kicked and punched again, and he still only dodged. Never had he tried to\nreply to my attacks, and I was getting angry. I accelerated my attacks, and he\nonly escalated to push me back and elbowing me in the stomach when I was\noverwhelming him. I went in for another punch, but he grabbed my wrist with his\nmetal arm and twisted it enough to constrict me.<br/></p><p>\u201cListen to me\u201d He breathed. &ldquo;You took a bullet\nin the chest on your very first mission, but you didn\u2019t die&rdquo; He kept on\ntalking, and the burning sensation in my lungs came back. Blood, pain, to\nprotect a briefcase.</p><p>\u201cShut up\u201d I flinched and rolled away from his grip\nas it weakened momentarily. I went back at him, trying to keep my anger in\ncheck. Jonathan wanted him alive. But I wouldn\u2019t let him off easy, and I pushed\nhard enough to force him to fight back. We exchanged kicks and punches, even if\nhis were voluntarily weak and indirect. He didn\u2019t give me a lot of openings,\nbut I finally managed to grab his throat and slam him down on the concrete. He\nstruggled against my hold, but I held on.</p><p>\u201cDawn\u201d He choked out as he gave up trying to get\nout. We locked eyes, and somehow I couldn\u2019t look away. \u201cI know you\u2019re in there.\nPlease come back to me\u201d</p><p>My internal battle hit me back ten folds. I could\nread every emotion in his eyes like a clear order. He was pleading and\ndesperate, but not for his life. His stare was searching mine, those icy blue\neyes I could have sworn I\u2019ve seen before. My fingers slowly released the grip\non his throat before I could stop it. Barnes saw the opportunity and pushed me\noff while rolling away from me.</p><p>I was thrown off, but it wasn\u2019t that hard like I\nknew he could. I landed on my feet and shakily stood up, not looking up at him.\nHe too was on his feet, and he wasn\u2019t making any move to attack me. My mask was\nin his hands right before he dropped it at his feet.<br/><br/>\nMy head was buzzing louder than ever, and I had to shake my head to just hear\nabove it. I knew Jonathan\u2019s men were coming, that it would be over soon, but\nanother part of me pushed to know more, insisting the buzzing would stop only\nif I got through it.</p><p>\nNo, the mission. I had to stall.<br/><br/>\nBut those visions weren\u2019t leaving me alone.<br/><br/>\nBut orders are orders. Wound him!<br/><br/>\nI had to rush my decision process, but I made my choice nonetheless. I grabbed\nmy gun in my thigh holster, aimed and shot.<br/><br/>\nThe bullet flew right past Bucky\u2019s shoulder and lodged itself in the button to\nmake the doors close. He jumped back in fear of my quick reaction, but his eyes\nwidened in disbelief when the heavy doors began to slide shut. James\u2019s angry\nface was the last thing I saw before the doors shut us from the outside.<br/><br/>\nI wanted to know more. Scratch that, I had to know more. The push was becoming\nstronger, and I wanted my headaches to end. <br/><br/>\n&ldquo;Dawn?&rdquo; He inquired with concern.<br/><br/>\n&ldquo;Shut up!&rdquo; I yelled out of instinct before shaking my head. This\ntime, I couldn\u2019t contain the part of me resisting that pull. I would regret\ndoing this; I don\u2019t even know why I deviated my shot to lock us up in here. I\u2019d\nhave a lot of explaining to Jonathan if I didn\u2019t want to suffer the\nconsequences.</p><p>He took one careful step, despite my gun aiming at\nhim once again. My finger was on the trigger, ready to shoot. &ldquo;You were on\nthe streets, stealing. I brought you to the Avengers. You became my\ntrainee&rdquo; He took one more step. <br/><br/>\n&ldquo;Lies!&rdquo; I roared. &ldquo;You\u2019re a liar. That\u2019s what you do\u201d<br/><br/>\n&quot;I\u2019m not lying, you know it&rdquo; His tone was softly shedding its\nsoftness and became more insistent. &ldquo;You know me&rdquo;<br/><br/>\n&ldquo;I don\u2019t!&rdquo; I forced myself to hold his glance even though that part\nof me screamed to believe him. I knew better, he\u2019d kill me if I let him win.<br/><br/>\n&ldquo;What\u2019s my name then?&rdquo; He got even closer.<br/><br/>\nI stopped the first name on my lips from coming. &ldquo;James Barnes&rdquo;<br/><br/>\n&ldquo;No, it\u2019s not&rdquo; His voice took a dangerous edge. &ldquo;Say it&rdquo;<br/><br/>\n&ldquo;You\u2019re Bucky&rdquo; I said as the curious side of my mind came back\nkicking. It was like a war in my head, and I wanted it to be over.<br/><br/>\n&ldquo;Yes, and who are you?&rdquo; He asked again.<br/><br/>\n&ldquo;No one&rdquo; I seethed as anger sparked in me again. &ldquo;I don\u2019t have a\nname. I\u2019m an asset&rdquo;<br/><br/>\n&ldquo;Your name is Da\u2013&rdquo;<br/><br/>\n&ldquo;Stop it with that name&rdquo; I interrupted him by trying to throw a punch\nat his face. His metal arm shot up yet again and easily grabbed my wrist. I\ntrashed around, but this time, his hold didn\u2019t waver. <br/><br/>\n&ldquo;Your name is Dawn. Your parents died when you were 16&rdquo; He kept going\non anyway.<br/><br/>\nI flinched as more flashes attacked my vision. Spanish essay. Policemen. Bad\nnews. Excruciating sadness.<br/><br/>\n&ldquo;Stop&rdquo; I pleaded as a heavy feeling took over me. Like my lungs were\ncompressed.<br/><br/>\n&ldquo;You need to snap out of it&rdquo; He ordered. &ldquo;I need you. Rose needs\nyou&rdquo;<br/><br/>\nI froze as the name echoed over in over again in my mind.<br/><br/>\nMy sister.<br/><br/>\nI was thrown once again into my visions defiling one by one in my head, but\nthis time, they were clear as crystal and detailed.<br/><br/><i>The birth of my sister.<br/><br/>\nThe night my parents died.<br/><br/>\nThe day I met Bucky.<br/><br/>\nThe feeling of the bullet tearing through my lung.<br/><br/>\nBucky and I\u2019s last mission.<br/></i><br/>\nMy eyes shot open as a torrent of information hit me all at once. All my senses\nwent to overdrive as I lost my footing, slipping out of Bucky\u2019s grip. I was\nhearing everything in the hangar, from the water dropping from the leaking pipe\nto Bucky\u2019s heavy breathing. I shut my eyes to stop the light from attacking my\neyes and I crawled until my back hit a wall.<br/><br/>\nAll the pain from the previous months until Reeves erased my memory.<br/><br/>\nThe starvation, the shocks, the torture.<br/><br/>\nIt all came and went like my memory had been transformed into a roulette. So\nmany chunks from these last years came and went so quickly, I couldn\u2019t even\nfocus on anything but pain. Despite this, I got to manage my breathing, and\nslowly opened my eyes. Bucky was standing there, looking concerned and afraid.</p><p>\nHe came back.<br/><br/>\n&ldquo;Dawn?&rdquo; He asked tentatively.</p><p>&ldquo;Buck&rdquo; I forced a smile as I let my head\nfall back on the wall. He came back. It was really him, or so I hoped. Many\ntimes I had imagined that moment, but he was too clear to be a trick of my\nmind. It had to be real. <br/><br/>\nHe didn\u2019t waste time rushing to me and kneeling at my side. &ldquo;I\u2019m so\nsorry&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;For what?&rdquo; I asked. I hated to see him blame himself.<br/><br/>\n&ldquo;For not coming sooner&rdquo; He replied.<br/><br/>\n&ldquo;You\u2019re an idiot to have ever come at all&rdquo; I breathed, now feeling\nexhausted. I wanted to go to sleep for a whole week.<br/><br/>\n&ldquo;I might be&rdquo; He smiled slightly, pushing a loose strand of hair\nbehind my ear.<br/><br/>\n&ldquo;You know they\u2019re waiting behind the door, right?&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;None\nof us will come out ourselves from here&rdquo;<br/><br/>\n&ldquo;Everybody is here, they will back us up\u2013&rdquo;<br/><br/>\n&ldquo;It won\u2019t be enough&rdquo; I shook my head. &ldquo;If Reeves gets to one of\nus, it\u2019s game over. You shouldn\u2019t have come back for me. Now we\u2019re both\nscrewed&rdquo; I closed my eyes again.<br/><br/>\n&ldquo;I made you a promise a while ago, when you were high on pain meds&rdquo;\nHe started. &ldquo;I promised I would always have your back. And as far as I\nknow, this counts as having your back&rdquo;<br/><br/>\nI opened my eyes again and looked into his. There was worry, and relief.\nWeariness, but a spark of energy still kicking. This wasn\u2019t him giving up on\nhimself for me; it was him being determined to bring me back home. With him.</p><p>Wow, that\u2019s must be what I was looking like when I\ngot him out of trouble last time. Now I understood his point of view, I think.\nSo I wouldn\u2019t let him drag me out of here without doing my part. No, Reeves\nwouldn\u2019t get him, he wouldn\u2019t get either one of us.<br/><br/>\nAnd there was only one way of making sure of it.<br/><br/>\n&ldquo;I may have an idea to get out of here&rdquo; I spoke slowly. &ldquo;But you\nwon\u2019t like it very much&rdquo;<br/><br/>\n&ldquo;Say it, because I don\u2019t have a better plan&rdquo; Bucky sighed. <br/><br/>\nI took a deep breath and looked down at my hands. \u201cIt\u2019s one simple sentence\u201d</p><p>\nUnderstanding instantly flashed in his eyes as he furiously shook his head. &ldquo;No&rdquo;\nHe refused. &ldquo;I will not re-activate you. Never&rdquo;<br/><br/>\n&ldquo;That\u2019s the only way&rdquo; I argued as I looked up at him.<br/><br/>\n&ldquo;No, we\u2019ll find something else&rdquo; He tried to compromise. &ldquo;You\njust snapped out of it. You are exhausted, and still confused. If you were to\nbe&hellip;&rdquo; He paused and gulped, something close to panic in his eyes.\n&ldquo;It could damage even more your mind&rdquo;<br/><br/>\n&ldquo;Bucky&rdquo; I reached to his face and placed my palm on his cheek. I knew\nit would mess up even more my brain, and I had no idea when I\u2019d snap out of it\nagain. &ldquo;It\u2019s either you do it, or they do it. And I\u2019d much rather see you\ndo it, than them&rdquo;<br/><br/>\nHe squeezed his eyes shut and played his hand on top of mine. He took deep breath,\nbefore finally nodding and handing me his phone. &ldquo;Show me&rdquo; He said\nreluctantly.<br/><br/>\nI took the phone and wrote the words. Just thinking about them made my hands\nshake, and I just hoped I\u2019d be done soon. I gave him the cell phone back and he\nstood up, then helped me on my feet too. He took one step back, and I didn\u2019t\ndare to look away from him. I didn\u2019t want to do this, I really didn\u2019t, but I\nhad no choice and I trusted him.</p><p>\n\u201cAre you sure?\u201d He asked as gunshots and yells could be heard outside.</p><p>\u201cNo\u201d I muttered. \u201cBut do it. Do it now\u201d</p><p>He quickly debated if he should do it, but an\nexplosion sound made up his mind. \u201cWhen dusk comes the warrior has fallen, but\nthe soldier rises to meet its salvation\u201d<br/><br/>\nIt hit me like a truck, so hard that I had to take a knee. All shaking in my\nlimbs stopped as I pushed myself back on my feet, then slowly looked up at the\nman in front of me. He was familiar, but I couldn\u2019t place him.<br/><br/>\nIt didn\u2019t matter, he was my handler.<br/><br/>\n&ldquo;Soldier?&rdquo; The pain was quickly wiped from his face and a stoic\nexpression replaced it.<br/><br/>\n&ldquo;Ready to comply&rdquo; I replied.<br/><br/>\n&ldquo;Get us out of here alive&rdquo; He ordered as he walked toward the two\ndiscarded guns on the ground. &ldquo;Shoot anyone who tries to stop us&rdquo;<br/><br/>\nI nodded as he offered me the guns.

Every time I tried to cross the fog\nto discover what it was about, I was pulled out of my sleep. All I could get\nwere five strong, different emotions proper to each vision. Joy, sorrow, renew,\npain, and urgency. Oh, and one, single name.<br><br>\nBucky.</p>[[MORE]]<p>It wasn\u2019t a coincidence, and I knew it. But when I tried to see this through\nwhile awake, it would hurt my head, like I wasn\u2019t supposed to access it despite\nthe little part of me that pushed restlessly for it.</p><p><i>\u201cI know you didn\u2019t want that for her\u201d</i></p><p>Those words were replaying in loop in my head, and\nI couldn\u2019t help but link them to my vision. I hadn\u2019t twitched yesterday, but I\ncertainly picked up on it. What did he mean by that? Was it true that I knew\nthem before? Was Stark right?<br><br>\nI hadn\u2019t been called yet this morning, so I was left even more pondering about\nthat. I was sitting on the edge of my stall, my weapons strapped on me, ready\nto go.<br><br>\nI had to think about it however for my screen to light up with Jonathan\u2019s face\non it.<br><br>\n\u201cSoldier\u201d He greeted. \u201cBarnes is coming, fast. And he\u2019s not\nalone\u201d<br><br>\nI stood up and straightened my back. \u201cWhat do you need me to do?\u201d I\nasked.<br><br>\n\u201cGo to the second basement and wait for him\u201d He ordered. \u201cI know\nStark will have had the building scanned and will instruct Barnes to go find\nyou there\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cAnd then?\u201d I raised an eyebrow. \u201cWhat do I do with him? Do I\nattack?\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cYou stall him until I can\u2019t get down there\u201d He replied.<br><br>\n\u201cCopy\u201d<br><br>\nI grabbed my assault rifle and made sure my favourite blade was in my utility\nbelt holster. I was already in the first basement, so I only walked the few\nfeet separating me from the staircase and got one floor down. It was a wide,\nempty hangar with a few garages in them.<br><br>\nI went to the one that could be closed with enforced steel doors and waited for\nsome company to arrive, gun in hand, ready to shoot. I had no idea what to\nexpect from that famous Sergeant Barnes, even if Jonathan told me he wouldn\u2019t\nhurt me. I chased every doubt I had and focused on the mission at hand. I\ncouldn\u2019t afford another failure.<br><br>\nI didn\u2019t have to wonder what would happen for too long, because footsteps were\nsuddenly coming my way. There was only one person coming, however. It must be him.\nThe metal arm gave the man\u2019s identity away when he stepped in the garage.<br><br>\nBarnes stopped when he saw me, like he couldn\u2019t believe what he was seeing. He\njogged toward me, and my eyes widened. It wasn\u2019t fear, not even after I\u2019ve\nheard of everything he\u2019s done. It was the wave of familiarity that hit me upon\nseeing him. I knew that man, and I couldn\u2019t stop the name from escaping my\nlips.<br><br>\n\u201cBucky?\u201d</p><p>It was muffled and distorted, but he had heard,\nhalting his steps.</p><p>\n\u201cDawn\u201d He breathed, like he was taken aback. He took several more steps\nforward, but still left a safe distance between us.<br><br>\nI had no idea why I knew he was Bucky, or why him calling me Dawn felt right.\nImages tugged at the corner of my mind and tried to come out, but it only\ncreated chaos in my head.<br><br>\n\u201cWhy do I know you?\u201d I frowned, trying to get a grip on myself. I was\ngetting frustrated with these dead ends.<br><br>\n\u201cYou saved me from Hydra, do you remember?\u201d He asked tentatively,\ntaking one more step forward. \u201cStopped them from taking me back\u201d<br><br>\nMy knees buckled when images flew past the fog and flashed in my vision. Images\nof fighting, kicking off a pod from a metal arm, flipping a bike into black\nclad agents. I had been desperate to get him out of there.</p><p>I lifted my gun and he held up his hands in\nsurrender. I had to get my head back in the task.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t wanna do this\u201d He warned.</p><p>\u201cI do actually\u201d I threw my gun on the ground and\nclosed the distance. I threw a punch, but he saw me coming and dodged it. I\nthen kicked and punched again, and he still only dodged. Never had he tried to\nreply to my attacks, and I was getting angry. I accelerated my attacks, and he\nonly escalated to push me back and elbowing me in the stomach when I was\noverwhelming him. I went in for another punch, but he grabbed my wrist with his\nmetal arm and twisted it enough to constrict me.<br></p><p>\u201cListen to me\u201d He breathed. \u201cYou took a bullet\nin the chest on your very first mission, but you didn\u2019t die\u201d He kept on\ntalking, and the burning sensation in my lungs came back. Blood, pain, to\nprotect a briefcase.</p><p>\u201cShut up\u201d I flinched and rolled away from his grip\nas it weakened momentarily. I went back at him, trying to keep my anger in\ncheck. Jonathan wanted him alive. But I wouldn\u2019t let him off easy, and I pushed\nhard enough to force him to fight back. We exchanged kicks and punches, even if\nhis were voluntarily weak and indirect. He didn\u2019t give me a lot of openings,\nbut I finally managed to grab his throat and slam him down on the concrete. He\nstruggled against my hold, but I held on.</p><p>\u201cDawn\u201d He choked out as he gave up trying to get\nout. We locked eyes, and somehow I couldn\u2019t look away. \u201cI know you\u2019re in there.\nPlease come back to me\u201d</p><p>My internal battle hit me back ten folds. I could\nread every emotion in his eyes like a clear order. He was pleading and\ndesperate, but not for his life. His stare was searching mine, those icy blue\neyes I could have sworn I\u2019ve seen before. My fingers slowly released the grip\non his throat before I could stop it. Barnes saw the opportunity and pushed me\noff while rolling away from me.</p><p>I was thrown off, but it wasn\u2019t that hard like I\nknew he could. I landed on my feet and shakily stood up, not looking up at him.\nHe too was on his feet, and he wasn\u2019t making any move to attack me. My mask was\nin his hands right before he dropped it at his feet.<br><br>\nMy head was buzzing louder than ever, and I had to shake my head to just hear\nabove it. I knew Jonathan\u2019s men were coming, that it would be over soon, but\nanother part of me pushed to know more, insisting the buzzing would stop only\nif I got through it.</p><p>\nNo, the mission. I had to stall.<br><br>\nBut those visions weren\u2019t leaving me alone.<br><br>\nBut orders are orders. Wound him!<br><br>\nI had to rush my decision process, but I made my choice nonetheless. I grabbed\nmy gun in my thigh holster, aimed and shot.<br><br>\nThe bullet flew right past Bucky\u2019s shoulder and lodged itself in the button to\nmake the doors close. He jumped back in fear of my quick reaction, but his eyes\nwidened in disbelief when the heavy doors began to slide shut. James\u2019s angry\nface was the last thing I saw before the doors shut us from the outside.<br><br>\nI wanted to know more. Scratch that, I had to know more. The push was becoming\nstronger, and I wanted my headaches to end. <br><br>\n\u201cDawn?\u201d He inquired with concern.<br><br>\n\u201cShut up!\u201d I yelled out of instinct before shaking my head. This\ntime, I couldn\u2019t contain the part of me resisting that pull. I would regret\ndoing this; I don\u2019t even know why I deviated my shot to lock us up in here. I\u2019d\nhave a lot of explaining to Jonathan if I didn\u2019t want to suffer the\nconsequences.</p><p>He took one careful step, despite my gun aiming at\nhim once again. My finger was on the trigger, ready to shoot. \u201cYou were on\nthe streets, stealing. I brought you to the Avengers. You became my\ntrainee\u201d He took one more step. <br><br>\n\u201cLies!\u201d I roared. \u201cYou\u2019re a liar. That\u2019s what you do\u201d<br><br>\n\"I\u2019m not lying, you know it\u201d His tone was softly shedding its\nsoftness and became more insistent. \u201cYou know me\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cI don\u2019t!\u201d I forced myself to hold his glance even though that part\nof me screamed to believe him. I knew better, he\u2019d kill me if I let him win.<br><br>\n\u201cWhat\u2019s my name then?\u201d He got even closer.<br><br>\nI stopped the first name on my lips from coming. \u201cJames Barnes\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s not\u201d His voice took a dangerous edge. \u201cSay it\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cYou\u2019re Bucky\u201d I said as the curious side of my mind came back\nkicking. It was like a war in my head, and I wanted it to be over.<br><br>\n\u201cYes, and who are you?\u201d He asked again.<br><br>\n\u201cNo one\u201d I seethed as anger sparked in me again. \u201cI don\u2019t have a\nname. I\u2019m an asset\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cYour name is Da\u2013\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cStop it with that name\u201d I interrupted him by trying to throw a punch\nat his face. His metal arm shot up yet again and easily grabbed my wrist. I\ntrashed around, but this time, his hold didn\u2019t waver. <br><br>\n\u201cYour name is Dawn. Your parents died when you were 16\u201d He kept going\non anyway.<br><br>\nI flinched as more flashes attacked my vision. Spanish essay. Policemen. Bad\nnews. Excruciating sadness.<br><br>\n\u201cStop\u201d I pleaded as a heavy feeling took over me. Like my lungs were\ncompressed.<br><br>\n\u201cYou need to snap out of it\u201d He ordered. \u201cI need you. Rose needs\nyou\u201d<br><br>\nI froze as the name echoed over in over again in my mind.<br><br>\nMy sister.<br><br>\nI was thrown once again into my visions defiling one by one in my head, but\nthis time, they were clear as crystal and detailed.<br><br><i>The birth of my sister.<br><br>\nThe night my parents died.<br><br>\nThe day I met Bucky.<br><br>\nThe feeling of the bullet tearing through my lung.<br><br>\nBucky and I\u2019s last mission.<br></i><br>\nMy eyes shot open as a torrent of information hit me all at once. All my senses\nwent to overdrive as I lost my footing, slipping out of Bucky\u2019s grip. I was\nhearing everything in the hangar, from the water dropping from the leaking pipe\nto Bucky\u2019s heavy breathing. I shut my eyes to stop the light from attacking my\neyes and I crawled until my back hit a wall.<br><br>\nAll the pain from the previous months until Reeves erased my memory.<br><br>\nThe starvation, the shocks, the torture.<br><br>\nIt all came and went like my memory had been transformed into a roulette. So\nmany chunks from these last years came and went so quickly, I couldn\u2019t even\nfocus on anything but pain. Despite this, I got to manage my breathing, and\nslowly opened my eyes. Bucky was standing there, looking concerned and afraid.</p><p>\nHe came back.<br><br>\n\u201cDawn?\u201d He asked tentatively.</p><p>\u201cBuck\u201d I forced a smile as I let my head\nfall back on the wall. He came back. It was really him, or so I hoped. Many\ntimes I had imagined that moment, but he was too clear to be a trick of my\nmind. It had to be real. <br><br>\nHe didn\u2019t waste time rushing to me and kneeling at my side. \u201cI\u2019m so\nsorry\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cFor what?\u201d I asked. I hated to see him blame himself.<br><br>\n\u201cFor not coming sooner\u201d He replied.<br><br>\n\u201cYou\u2019re an idiot to have ever come at all\u201d I breathed, now feeling\nexhausted. I wanted to go to sleep for a whole week.<br><br>\n\u201cI might be\u201d He smiled slightly, pushing a loose strand of hair\nbehind my ear.<br><br>\n\u201cYou know they\u2019re waiting behind the door, right?\u201d I said. \u201cNone\nof us will come out ourselves from here\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cEverybody is here, they will back us up\u2013\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cIt won\u2019t be enough\u201d I shook my head. \u201cIf Reeves gets to one of\nus, it\u2019s game over. You shouldn\u2019t have come back for me. Now we\u2019re both\nscrewed\u201d I closed my eyes again.<br><br>\n\u201cI made you a promise a while ago, when you were high on pain meds\u201d\nHe started. \u201cI promised I would always have your back. And as far as I\nknow, this counts as having your back\u201d<br><br>\nI opened my eyes again and looked into his. There was worry, and relief.\nWeariness, but a spark of energy still kicking. This wasn\u2019t him giving up on\nhimself for me; it was him being determined to bring me back home. With him.</p><p>Wow, that\u2019s must be what I was looking like when I\ngot him out of trouble last time. Now I understood his point of view, I think.\nSo I wouldn\u2019t let him drag me out of here without doing my part. No, Reeves\nwouldn\u2019t get him, he wouldn\u2019t get either one of us.<br><br>\nAnd there was only one way of making sure of it.<br><br>\n\u201cI may have an idea to get out of here\u201d I spoke slowly. \u201cBut you\nwon\u2019t like it very much\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cSay it, because I don\u2019t have a better plan\u201d Bucky sighed. <br><br>\nI took a deep breath and looked down at my hands. \u201cIt\u2019s one simple sentence\u201d</p><p>\nUnderstanding instantly flashed in his eyes as he furiously shook his head. \u201cNo\u201d\nHe refused. \u201cI will not re-activate you. Never\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cThat\u2019s the only way\u201d I argued as I looked up at him.<br><br>\n\u201cNo, we\u2019ll find something else\u201d He tried to compromise. \u201cYou\njust snapped out of it. You are exhausted, and still confused. If you were to\nbe\u2026\u201d He paused and gulped, something close to panic in his eyes.\n\u201cIt could damage even more your mind\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cBucky\u201d I reached to his face and placed my palm on his cheek. I knew\nit would mess up even more my brain, and I had no idea when I\u2019d snap out of it\nagain. \u201cIt\u2019s either you do it, or they do it. And I\u2019d much rather see you\ndo it, than them\u201d<br><br>\nHe squeezed his eyes shut and played his hand on top of mine. He took deep breath,\nbefore finally nodding and handing me his phone. \u201cShow me\u201d He said\nreluctantly.<br><br>\nI took the phone and wrote the words. Just thinking about them made my hands\nshake, and I just hoped I\u2019d be done soon. I gave him the cell phone back and he\nstood up, then helped me on my feet too. He took one step back, and I didn\u2019t\ndare to look away from him. I didn\u2019t want to do this, I really didn\u2019t, but I\nhad no choice and I trusted him.</p><p>\n\u201cAre you sure?\u201d He asked as gunshots and yells could be heard outside.</p><p>\u201cNo\u201d I muttered. \u201cBut do it. Do it now\u201d</p><p>He quickly debated if he should do it, but an\nexplosion sound made up his mind. \u201cWhen dusk comes the warrior has fallen, but\nthe soldier rises to meet its salvation\u201d<br><br>\nIt hit me like a truck, so hard that I had to take a knee. All shaking in my\nlimbs stopped as I pushed myself back on my feet, then slowly looked up at the\nman in front of me. He was familiar, but I couldn\u2019t place him.<br><br>\nIt didn\u2019t matter, he was my handler.<br><br>\n\u201cSoldier?\u201d The pain was quickly wiped from his face and a stoic\nexpression replaced it.<br><br>\n\u201cReady to comply\u201d I replied.<br><br>\n\u201cGet us out of here alive\u201d He ordered as he walked toward the two\ndiscarded guns on the ground. \u201cShoot anyone who tries to stop us\u201d<br><br>\nI nodded as he offered me the guns. I grabbed them, put the smallest one in my\nholster and kept the rifle in my hands. I walked to the control panel and\nrebooted the system. The doors opened automatically when it was done, and I\nlifted my gun to be ready. My handler did the same thing as about five dozens\nof guns were pointed our way.</p><p>They were ready to take me down, but so was I.</p><p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p><p>Tag list</p><p>@<a href=\"http://potato-with-possible-standards.tumblr.com/\">potato-with-possible-standards</a>\u00a0@<a href=\"http://customcrouton.tumblr.com/\">customcrouton</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mtlo37SP-5MH331oZt-zpcQ\">@stressedoutkylo</a></p>",

I was already in the first basement, so I only walked the few\nfeet separating me from the staircase and got one floor down. It was a wide,\nempty hangar with a few garages in them.<br><br>\nI went to the one that could be closed with enforced steel doors and waited for\nsome company to arrive, gun in hand, ready to shoot. I had no idea what to\nexpect from that famous Sergeant Barnes, even if Jonathan told me he wouldn\u2019t\nhurt me. I chased every doubt I had and focused on the mission at hand. I\ncouldn\u2019t afford another failure.<br><br>\nI didn\u2019t have to wonder what would happen for too long, because footsteps were\nsuddenly coming my way. There was only one person coming, however. It must be him.\nThe metal arm gave the man\u2019s identity away when he stepped in the garage.<br><br>\nBarnes stopped when he saw me, like he couldn\u2019t believe what he was seeing. He\njogged toward me, and my eyes widened. It wasn\u2019t fear, not even after I\u2019ve\nheard of everything he\u2019s done. It was the wave of familiarity that hit me upon\nseeing him. I knew that man, and I couldn\u2019t stop the name from escaping my\nlips.<br><br>\n\u201cBucky?\u201d</p><p>It was muffled and distorted, but he had heard,\nhalting his steps.</p><p>\n\u201cDawn\u201d He breathed, like he was taken aback. He took several more steps\nforward, but still left a safe distance between us.<br><br>\nI had no idea why I knew he was Bucky, or why him calling me Dawn felt right.\nImages tugged at the corner of my mind and tried to come out, but it only\ncreated chaos in my head.<br><br>\n\u201cWhy do I know you?\u201d I frowned, trying to get a grip on myself. I was\ngetting frustrated with these dead ends.<br><br>\n\u201cYou saved me from Hydra, do you remember?\u201d He asked tentatively,\ntaking one more step forward. \u201cStopped them from taking me back\u201d<br><br>\nMy knees buckled when images flew past the fog and flashed in my vision. Images\nof fighting, kicking off a pod from a metal arm, flipping a bike into black\nclad agents. I had been desperate to get him out of there.</p><p>I lifted my gun and he held up his hands in\nsurrender. I had to get my head back in the task.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t wanna do this\u201d He warned.</p><p>\u201cI do actually\u201d I threw my gun on the ground and\nclosed the distance. I threw a punch, but he saw me coming and dodged it. I\nthen kicked and punched again, and he still only dodged. Never had he tried to\nreply to my attacks, and I was getting angry. I accelerated my attacks, and he\nonly escalated to push me back and elbowing me in the stomach when I was\noverwhelming him. I went in for another punch, but he grabbed my wrist with his\nmetal arm and twisted it enough to constrict me.<br></p><p>\u201cListen to me\u201d He breathed. \u201cYou took a bullet\nin the chest on your very first mission, but you didn\u2019t die\u201d He kept on\ntalking, and the burning sensation in my lungs came back. Blood, pain, to\nprotect a briefcase.</p><p>\u201cShut up\u201d I flinched and rolled away from his grip\nas it weakened momentarily. I went back at him, trying to keep my anger in\ncheck. Jonathan wanted him alive. But I wouldn\u2019t let him off easy, and I pushed\nhard enough to force him to fight back. We exchanged kicks and punches, even if\nhis were voluntarily weak and indirect. He didn\u2019t give me a lot of openings,\nbut I finally managed to grab his throat and slam him down on the concrete. He\nstruggled against my hold, but I held on.</p><p>\u201cDawn\u201d He choked out as he gave up trying to get\nout. We locked eyes, and somehow I couldn\u2019t look away. \u201cI know you\u2019re in there.\nPlease come back to me\u201d</p><p>My internal battle hit me back ten folds. I could\nread every emotion in his eyes like a clear order. He was pleading and\ndesperate, but not for his life. His stare was searching mine, those icy blue\neyes I could have sworn I\u2019ve seen before. My fingers slowly released the grip\non his throat before I could stop it. Barnes saw the opportunity and pushed me\noff while rolling away from me.</p><p>I was thrown off, but it wasn\u2019t that hard like I\nknew he could. I landed on my feet and shakily stood up, not looking up at him.\nHe too was on his feet, and he wasn\u2019t making any move to attack me. My mask was\nin his hands right before he dropped it at his feet.<br><br>\nMy head was buzzing louder than ever, and I had to shake my head to just hear\nabove it. I knew Jonathan\u2019s men were coming, that it would be over soon, but\nanother part of me pushed to know more, insisting the buzzing would stop only\nif I got through it.</p><p>\nNo, the mission. I had to stall.<br><br>\nBut those visions weren\u2019t leaving me alone.<br><br>\nBut orders are orders. Wound him!<br><br>\nI had to rush my decision process, but I made my choice nonetheless. I grabbed\nmy gun in my thigh holster, aimed and shot.<br><br>\nThe bullet flew right past Bucky\u2019s shoulder and lodged itself in the button to\nmake the doors close. He jumped back in fear of my quick reaction, but his eyes\nwidened in disbelief when the heavy doors began to slide shut. James\u2019s angry\nface was the last thing I saw before the doors shut us from the outside.<br><br>\nI wanted to know more. Scratch that, I had to know more. The push was becoming\nstronger, and I wanted my headaches to end. <br><br>\n\u201cDawn?\u201d He inquired with concern.<br><br>\n\u201cShut up!\u201d I yelled out of instinct before shaking my head. This\ntime, I couldn\u2019t contain the part of me resisting that pull. I would regret\ndoing this; I don\u2019t even know why I deviated my shot to lock us up in here. I\u2019d\nhave a lot of explaining to Jonathan if I didn\u2019t want to suffer the\nconsequences.</p><p>He took one careful step, despite my gun aiming at\nhim once again. My finger was on the trigger, ready to shoot. \u201cYou were on\nthe streets, stealing. I brought you to the Avengers. You became my\ntrainee\u201d He took one more step. <br><br>\n\u201cLies!\u201d I roared. \u201cYou\u2019re a liar. That\u2019s what you do\u201d<br><br>\n\"I\u2019m not lying, you know it\u201d His tone was softly shedding its\nsoftness and became more insistent. \u201cYou know me\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cI don\u2019t!\u201d I forced myself to hold his glance even though that part\nof me screamed to believe him. I knew better, he\u2019d kill me if I let him win.<br><br>\n\u201cWhat\u2019s my name then?\u201d He got even closer.<br><br>\nI stopped the first name on my lips from coming. \u201cJames Barnes\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s not\u201d His voice took a dangerous edge. \u201cSay it\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cYou\u2019re Bucky\u201d I said as the curious side of my mind came back\nkicking. It was like a war in my head, and I wanted it to be over.<br><br>\n\u201cYes, and who are you?\u201d He asked again.<br><br>\n\u201cNo one\u201d I seethed as anger sparked in me again. \u201cI don\u2019t have a\nname. I\u2019m an asset\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cYour name is Da\u2013\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cStop it with that name\u201d I interrupted him by trying to throw a punch\nat his face. His metal arm shot up yet again and easily grabbed my wrist. I\ntrashed around, but this time, his hold didn\u2019t waver. <br><br>\n\u201cYour name is Dawn. Your parents died when you were 16\u201d He kept going\non anyway.<br><br>\nI flinched as more flashes attacked my vision. Spanish essay. Policemen. Bad\nnews. Excruciating sadness.<br><br>\n\u201cStop\u201d I pleaded as a heavy feeling took over me. Like my lungs were\ncompressed.<br><br>\n\u201cYou need to snap out of it\u201d He ordered. \u201cI need you. Rose needs\nyou\u201d<br><br>\nI froze as the name echoed over in over again in my mind.<br><br>\nMy sister.<br><br>\nI was thrown once again into my visions defiling one by one in my head, but\nthis time, they were clear as crystal and detailed.<br><br><i>The birth of my sister.<br><br>\nThe night my parents died.<br><br>\nThe day I met Bucky.<br><br>\nThe feeling of the bullet tearing through my lung.<br><br>\nBucky and I\u2019s last mission.<br></i><br>\nMy eyes shot open as a torrent of information hit me all at once. All my senses\nwent to overdrive as I lost my footing, slipping out of Bucky\u2019s grip. I was\nhearing everything in the hangar, from the water dropping from the leaking pipe\nto Bucky\u2019s heavy breathing. I shut my eyes to stop the light from attacking my\neyes and I crawled until my back hit a wall.<br><br>\nAll the pain from the previous months until Reeves erased my memory.<br><br>\nThe starvation, the shocks, the torture.<br><br>\nIt all came and went like my memory had been transformed into a roulette. So\nmany chunks from these last years came and went so quickly, I couldn\u2019t even\nfocus on anything but pain. Despite this, I got to manage my breathing, and\nslowly opened my eyes. Bucky was standing there, looking concerned and afraid.</p><p>\nHe came back.<br><br>\n\u201cDawn?\u201d He asked tentatively.</p><p>\u201cBuck\u201d I forced a smile as I let my head\nfall back on the wall. He came back. It was really him, or so I hoped. Many\ntimes I had imagined that moment, but he was too clear to be a trick of my\nmind. It had to be real. <br><br>\nHe didn\u2019t waste time rushing to me and kneeling at my side. \u201cI\u2019m so\nsorry\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cFor what?\u201d I asked. I hated to see him blame himself.<br><br>\n\u201cFor not coming sooner\u201d He replied.<br><br>\n\u201cYou\u2019re an idiot to have ever come at all\u201d I breathed, now feeling\nexhausted. I wanted to go to sleep for a whole week.<br><br>\n\u201cI might be\u201d He smiled slightly, pushing a loose strand of hair\nbehind my ear.<br><br>\n\u201cYou know they\u2019re waiting behind the door, right?\u201d I said. \u201cNone\nof us will come out ourselves from here\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cEverybody is here, they will back us up\u2013\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cIt won\u2019t be enough\u201d I shook my head. \u201cIf Reeves gets to one of\nus, it\u2019s game over. You shouldn\u2019t have come back for me. Now we\u2019re both\nscrewed\u201d I closed my eyes again.<br><br>\n\u201cI made you a promise a while ago, when you were high on pain meds\u201d\nHe started. \u201cI promised I would always have your back. And as far as I\nknow, this counts as having your back\u201d<br><br>\nI opened my eyes again and looked into his. There was worry, and relief.\nWeariness, but a spark of energy still kicking. This wasn\u2019t him giving up on\nhimself for me; it was him being determined to bring me back home. With him.</p><p>Wow, that\u2019s must be what I was looking like when I\ngot him out of trouble last time. Now I understood his point of view, I think.\nSo I wouldn\u2019t let him drag me out of here without doing my part. No, Reeves\nwouldn\u2019t get him, he wouldn\u2019t get either one of us.<br><br>\nAnd there was only one way of making sure of it.<br><br>\n\u201cI may have an idea to get out of here\u201d I spoke slowly. \u201cBut you\nwon\u2019t like it very much\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cSay it, because I don\u2019t have a better plan\u201d Bucky sighed. <br><br>\nI took a deep breath and looked down at my hands. \u201cIt\u2019s one simple sentence\u201d</p><p>\nUnderstanding instantly flashed in his eyes as he furiously shook his head. \u201cNo\u201d\nHe refused. \u201cI will not re-activate you. Never\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cThat\u2019s the only way\u201d I argued as I looked up at him.<br><br>\n\u201cNo, we\u2019ll find something else\u201d He tried to compromise. \u201cYou\njust snapped out of it. You are exhausted, and still confused. If you were to\nbe\u2026\u201d He paused and gulped, something close to panic in his eyes.\n\u201cIt could damage even more your mind\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cBucky\u201d I reached to his face and placed my palm on his cheek. I knew\nit would mess up even more my brain, and I had no idea when I\u2019d snap out of it\nagain. \u201cIt\u2019s either you do it, or they do it. And I\u2019d much rather see you\ndo it, than them\u201d<br><br>\nHe squeezed his eyes shut and played his hand on top of mine. He took deep breath,\nbefore finally nodding and handing me his phone. \u201cShow me\u201d He said\nreluctantly.<br><br>\nI took the phone and wrote the words. Just thinking about them made my hands\nshake, and I just hoped I\u2019d be done soon. I gave him the cell phone back and he\nstood up, then helped me on my feet too. He took one step back, and I didn\u2019t\ndare to look away from him. I didn\u2019t want to do this, I really didn\u2019t, but I\nhad no choice and I trusted him.</p><p>\n\u201cAre you sure?\u201d He asked as gunshots and yells could be heard outside.</p><p>\u201cNo\u201d I muttered. \u201cBut do it. Do it now\u201d</p><p>He quickly debated if he should do it, but an\nexplosion sound made up his mind. \u201cWhen dusk comes the warrior has fallen, but\nthe soldier rises to meet its salvation\u201d<br><br>\nIt hit me like a truck, so hard that I had to take a knee. All shaking in my\nlimbs stopped as I pushed myself back on my feet, then slowly looked up at the\nman in front of me. He was familiar, but I couldn\u2019t place him.<br><br>\nIt didn\u2019t matter, he was my handler.<br><br>\n\u201cSoldier?\u201d The pain was quickly wiped from his face and a stoic\nexpression replaced it.<br><br>\n\u201cReady to comply\u201d I replied.<br><br>\n\u201cGet us out of here alive\u201d He ordered as he walked toward the two\ndiscarded guns on the ground. \u201cShoot anyone who tries to stop us\u201d<br><br>\nI nodded as he offered me the guns. I grabbed them, put the smallest one in my\nholster and kept the rifle in my hands. I walked to the control panel and\nrebooted the system. The doors opened automatically when it was done, and I\nlifted my gun to be ready. My handler did the same thing as about five dozens\nof guns were pointed our way.</p><p>They were ready to take me down, but so was I.</p><p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p><p>Tag list</p><p>@<a href=\"http://potato-with-possible-standards.tumblr.com/\">potato-with-possible-standards</a>\u00a0@<a href=\"http://customcrouton.tumblr.com/\">customcrouton</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mtlo37SP-5MH331oZt-zpcQ\">@stressedoutkylo</a></p>",

Blood, pain, to\nprotect a briefcase.</p><p>&ldquo;Shut up&rdquo; I flinched and rolled away from his grip\nas it weakened momentarily. I went back at him, trying to keep my anger in\ncheck. Jonathan wanted him alive. But I wouldn&rsquo;t let him off easy, and I pushed\nhard enough to force him to fight back. We exchanged kicks and punches, even if\nhis were voluntarily weak and indirect. He didn&rsquo;t give me a lot of openings,\nbut I finally managed to grab his throat and slam him down on the concrete. He\nstruggled against my hold, but I held on.</p><p>&ldquo;Dawn&rdquo; He choked out as he gave up trying to get\nout. We locked eyes, and somehow I couldn&rsquo;t look away. &ldquo;I know you&rsquo;re in there.\nPlease come back to me&rdquo;</p><p>My internal battle hit me back ten folds. I could\nread every emotion in his eyes like a clear order. He was pleading and\ndesperate, but not for his life. His stare was searching mine, those icy blue\neyes I could have sworn I&rsquo;ve seen before. My fingers slowly released the grip\non his throat before I could stop it. Barnes saw the opportunity and pushed me\noff while rolling away from me.</p><p>I was thrown off, but it wasn&rsquo;t that hard like I\nknew he could. I landed on my feet and shakily stood up, not looking up at him.\nHe too was on his feet, and he wasn&rsquo;t making any move to attack me. My mask was\nin his hands right before he dropped it at his feet.<br /><br />\nMy head was buzzing louder than ever, and I had to shake my head to just hear\nabove it. I knew Jonathan&rsquo;s men were coming, that it would be over soon, but\nanother part of me pushed to know more, insisting the buzzing would stop only\nif I got through it.</p><p>\nNo, the mission. I had to stall.<br /><br />\nBut those visions weren&rsquo;t leaving me alone.<br /><br />\nBut orders are orders. Wound him!<br /><br />\nI had to rush my decision process, but I made my choice nonetheless. I grabbed\nmy gun in my thigh holster, aimed and shot.<br /><br />\nThe bullet flew right past Bucky&rsquo;s shoulder and lodged itself in the button to\nmake the doors close. He jumped back in fear of my quick reaction, but his eyes\nwidened in disbelief when the heavy doors began to slide shut. James&rsquo;s angry\nface was the last thing I saw before the doors shut us from the outside.<br /><br />\nI wanted to know more. Scratch that, I had to know more. The push was becoming\nstronger, and I wanted my headaches to end. <br /><br />\n&ldquo;Dawn?&rdquo; He inquired with concern.<br /><br />\n&ldquo;Shut up!&rdquo; I yelled out of instinct before shaking my head. This\ntime, I couldn&rsquo;t contain the part of me resisting that pull. I would regret\ndoing this; I don&rsquo;t even know why I deviated my shot to lock us up in here. I&rsquo;d\nhave a lot of explaining to Jonathan if I didn&rsquo;t want to suffer the\nconsequences.</p><p>He took one careful step, despite my gun aiming at\nhim once again. My finger was on the trigger, ready to shoot. &ldquo;You were on\nthe streets, stealing. I brought you to the Avengers. You became my\ntrainee&rdquo; He took one more step. <br /><br />\n&ldquo;Lies!&rdquo; I roared. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a liar. That&rsquo;s what you do&rdquo;<br /><br />\n\"I&rsquo;m not lying, you know it&rdquo; His tone was softly shedding its\nsoftness and became more insistent. &ldquo;You know me&rdquo;<br /><br />\n&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; I forced myself to hold his glance even though that part\nof me screamed to believe him. I knew better, he&rsquo;d kill me if I let him win.<br /><br />\n&ldquo;What&rsquo;s my name then?&rdquo; He got even closer.<br /><br />\nI stopped the first name on my lips from coming. &ldquo;James Barnes&rdquo;<br /><br />\n&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s not&rdquo; His voice took a dangerous edge. &ldquo;Say it&rdquo;<br /><br />\n&ldquo;You&rsquo;re Bucky&rdquo; I said as the curious side of my mind came back\nkicking. It was like a war in my head, and I wanted it to be over.<br /><br />\n&ldquo;Yes, and who are you?&rdquo; He asked again.<br /><br />\n&ldquo;No one&rdquo; I seethed as anger sparked in me again. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have a\nname. I&rsquo;m an asset&rdquo;<br /><br />\n&ldquo;Your name is Da&ndash;&rdquo;<br /><br />\n&ldquo;Stop it with that name&rdquo; I interrupted him by trying to throw a punch\nat his face. His metal arm shot up yet again and easily grabbed my wrist. I\ntrashed around, but this time, his hold didn&rsquo;t waver. <br /><br />\n&ldquo;Your name is Dawn. Your parents died when you were 16&rdquo; He kept going\non anyway.<br /><br />\nI flinched as more flashes attacked my vision. Spanish essay. Policemen. Bad\nnews. Excruciating sadness.<br /><br />\n&ldquo;Stop&rdquo; I pleaded as a heavy feeling took over me. Like my lungs were\ncompressed.<br /><br />\n&ldquo;You need to snap out of it&rdquo; He ordered. &ldquo;I need you. Rose needs\nyou&rdquo;<br /><br />\nI froze as the name echoed over in over again in my mind.<br /><br />\nMy sister.<br /><br />\nI was thrown once again into my visions defiling one by one in my head, but\nthis time, they were clear as crystal and detailed.<br /><br /><i>The birth of my sister.<br /><br />\nThe night my parents died.<br /><br />\nThe day I met Bucky.<br /><br />\nThe feeling of the bullet tearing through my lung.<br /><br />\nBucky and I&rsquo;s last mission.<br /></i><br />\nMy eyes shot open as a torrent of information hit me all at once. All my senses\nwent to overdrive as I lost my footing, slipping out of Bucky&rsquo;s grip. I was\nhearing everything in the hangar, from the water dropping from the leaking pipe\nto Bucky&rsquo;s heavy breathing. I shut my eyes to stop the light from attacking my\neyes and I crawled until my back hit a wall.<br /><br />\nAll the pain from the previous months until Reeves erased my memory.<br /><br />\nThe starvation, the shocks, the torture.<br /><br />\nIt all came and went like my memory had been transformed into a roulette. So\nmany chunks from these last years came and went so quickly, I couldn&rsquo;t even\nfocus on anything but pain. Despite this, I got to manage my breathing, and\nslowly opened my eyes. Bucky was standing there, looking concerned and afraid.</p><p>\nHe came back.<br /><br />\n&ldquo;Dawn?&rdquo; He asked tentatively.</p><p>&ldquo;Buck&rdquo; I forced a smile as I let my head\nfall back on the wall. He came back. It was really him, or so I hoped. Many\ntimes I had imagined that moment, but he was too clear to be a trick of my\nmind. It had to be real. <br /><br />\nHe didn&rsquo;t waste time rushing to me and kneeling at my side. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so\nsorry&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;For what?&rdquo; I asked. I hated to see him blame himself.<br /><br />\n&ldquo;For not coming sooner&rdquo; He replied.<br /><br />\n&ldquo;You&rsquo;re an idiot to have ever come at all&rdquo; I breathed, now feeling\nexhausted. I wanted to go to sleep for a whole week.<br /><br />\n&ldquo;I might be&rdquo; He smiled slightly, pushing a loose strand of hair\nbehind my ear.<br /><br />\n&ldquo;You know they&rsquo;re waiting behind the door, right?&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;None\nof us will come out ourselves from here&rdquo;<br /><br />\n&ldquo;Everybody is here, they will back us up&ndash;&rdquo;<br /><br />\n&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t be enough&rdquo; I shook my head. &ldquo;If Reeves gets to one of\nus, it&rsquo;s game over. You shouldn&rsquo;t have come back for me. Now we&rsquo;re both\nscrewed&rdquo; I closed my eyes again.<br /><br />\n&ldquo;I made you a promise a while ago, when you were high on pain meds&rdquo;\nHe started. &ldquo;I promised I would always have your back. And as far as I\nknow, this counts as having your back&rdquo;<br /><br />\nI opened my eyes again and looked into his. There was worry, and relief.\nWeariness, but a spark of energy still kicking. This wasn&rsquo;t him giving up on\nhimself for me; it was him being determined to bring me back home. With him.</p><p>Wow, that&rsquo;s must be what I was looking like when I\ngot him out of trouble last time. Now I understood his point of view, I think.\nSo I wouldn&rsquo;t let him drag me out of here without doing my part. No, Reeves\nwouldn&rsquo;t get him, he wouldn&rsquo;t get either one of us.<br /><br />\nAnd there was only one way of making sure of it.<br /><br />\n&ldquo;I may have an idea to get out of here&rdquo; I spoke slowly. &ldquo;But you\nwon&rsquo;t like it very much&rdquo;<br /><br />\n&ldquo;Say it, because I don&rsquo;t have a better plan&rdquo; Bucky sighed. <br /><br />\nI took a deep breath and looked down at my hands. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s one simple sentence&rdquo;</p><p>\nUnderstanding instantly flashed in his eyes as he furiously shook his head. &ldquo;No&rdquo;\nHe refused. &ldquo;I will not re-activate you. Never&rdquo;<br /><br />\n&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the only way&rdquo; I argued as I looked up at him.<br /><br />\n&ldquo;No, we&rsquo;ll find something else&rdquo; He tried to compromise. &ldquo;You\njust snapped out of it. You are exhausted, and still confused. If you were to\nbe&hellip;&rdquo; He paused and gulped, something close to panic in his eyes.\n&ldquo;It could damage even more your mind&rdquo;<br /><br />\n&ldquo;Bucky&rdquo; I reached to his face and placed my palm on his cheek. I knew\nit would mess up even more my brain, and I had no idea when I&rsquo;d snap out of it\nagain. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s either you do it, or they do it. And I&rsquo;d much rather see you\ndo it, than them&rdquo;<br /><br />\nHe squeezed his eyes shut and played his hand on top of mine. He took deep breath,\nbefore finally nodding and handing me his phone. &ldquo;Show me&rdquo; He said\nreluctantly.<br /><br />\nI took the phone and wrote the words. Just thinking about them made my hands\nshake, and I just hoped I&rsquo;d be done soon. I gave him the cell phone back and he\nstood up, then helped me on my feet too. He took one step back, and I didn&rsquo;t\ndare to look away from him. I didn&rsquo;t want to do this, I really didn&rsquo;t, but I\nhad no choice and I trusted him.</p><p>\n&ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo; He asked as gunshots and yells could be heard outside.</p><p>&ldquo;No&rdquo; I muttered. &ldquo;But do it. Do it now&rdquo;</p><p>He quickly debated if he should do it, but an\nexplosion sound made up his mind. &ldquo;When dusk comes the warrior has fallen, but\nthe soldier rises to meet its salvation&rdquo;<br /><br />\nIt hit me like a truck, so hard that I had to take a knee. All shaking in my\nlimbs stopped as I pushed myself back on my feet, then slowly looked up at the\nman in front of me. He was familiar, but I couldn&rsquo;t place him.<br /><br />\nIt didn&rsquo;t matter, he was my handler.<br /><br />\n&ldquo;Soldier?&rdquo; The pain was quickly wiped from his face and a stoic\nexpression replaced it.<br /><br />\n&ldquo;Ready to comply&rdquo; I replied.<br /><br />\n&ldquo;Get us out of here alive&rdquo; He ordered as he walked toward the two\ndiscarded guns on the ground. &ldquo;Shoot anyone who tries to stop us&rdquo;<br /><br />\nI nodded as he offered me the guns. I grabbed them, put the smallest one in my\nholster and kept the rifle in my hands. I walked to the control panel and\nrebooted the system. The doors opened automatically when it was done, and I\nlifted my gun to be ready. My handler did the same thing as about five dozens\nof guns were pointed our way.</p><p>They were ready to take me down, but so was I.</p><p>&bull;&bull;&bull;</p><p>Tag list</p><p>@<a href=\"http://potato-with-possible-standards.tumblr.com/\">potato-with-possible-standards</a>&nbsp;@<a href=\"http://customcrouton.tumblr.com/\">customcrouton</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mtlo37SP-5MH331oZt-zpcQ\">@stressedoutkylo</a></p>",

In this group we have two categories, deceased and alive. The deceased characters can interact only with other deceased characters from where they\u2019re trapped inside the Soul Stone\u2019s pocket dimension.
