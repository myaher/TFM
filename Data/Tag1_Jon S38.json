        "answer": "<p>Is that the yes and no one? It felt like he said the end is the same, just the way there is different. Why would I care? Its the end that I hate. I cant be bothered with his trolling. Hes not going to reveal what I would need to bother, so Ill just walk out. No point in staying. Its sad that I saw right through the amazing (not) Danielle is evil and still hate what he did for it.</p><p>Jon\u2019s last stretch of the story with danielle is too shit and his end is too bitter. She completely destroyed him and he didnt deserve this. And GRRM would do something similar because he says the endgame is the same and that means Jon exiled at the Wall. I am so offended and Jon isnt my fav. Ive cried because of this. I cry a lot as I have a sensitive soul but I dont usually cry in fiction, because you know it\u2019s fiction and it\u2019s not real. Last time was when I watched the little mermaid when i was still 7. I hate it because she left her father. I love a good family story.</p><p>I read and saw Jon\u2019s stuff from the beginning and I was always slightly bored. But he was a decent boy, always tried to do the right thing. He just wanted to be accepted and loved, wished for going back to Winterfell to his family more than anything. It was boring, but wtv. I rolled my eyes at him, always brooding. In the end, some bitch from hell comes and destroys him with some shit abusive romance who was never real, then he gets exiled to a place he was never happy in for doing the right thing which is kill her hitler with tits arse. Im not even going to comment on the rest, I am assuming most of it is D&amp;D creative crap, but that would make it even worse. He was a generic boring boy, why would the author do this to him? In headcanon its fixed like in two weeks. But why? WHY? HE ISNT EVEN MY FAVOURITE CHARACTER AND IM SO UPSET.</p><p>Sansa, alone in Winterfell without a semblance of the girl she was. She wanted to go back home and be with Lady and her family. She is all alone with her bannermen. Who chose her because their preferred king was punished and sent to the wall. She is queen in the north so this is \u00bd of what I wanted for her.</p><p>Arya going in adventures, I like. Its also 1/\u201d of what I wanted for her, to be free to be who she wanted. But she also wanted to go home and be with her family and SHE IS NOT and by sailing east she is saying bye bye for like a decade. Someone who sent half of her time going home and another half trying to Forget what home was, but never managing to.</p><p>Bran is still robot!Bran. I have no idea why people who are fans of him are happy with his ending. Its not Bran. Its the Three Eyes Raven. Bran is like in 5% the corner of his mind. If it was Bran it would be fine. He is not\u2019. The books may be different but he is still surrounded by shit snakes (only Sam is worthy it).</p><p>Theon and Jaime died with 50% of their redemption done. Ive seen comics for kids doing redemption arcs better.</p><p>Cersei deserved surviving the lizard bitch but she had the best ending despite that. She died with whom she loved. She is the one I\u2019m at most peace with.</p><p><b>What am I supposed to re-read this for?</b> Every time I read Theon being mutilated, I\u2019m reminded he dies without happiness? Every time Jon angsts about not being a Stark and that he wishes he was one, how he just wanted his old times back, I\u2019m reminded they destroyed him and of his bitter end? Every time Sansa thinks about romance and gets her hopes dashed again and again, I\u2019m reminded of her lonely end? Every time Arya thinks about her family and that is what keeps her core intact, I\u2018m reminded that her end is leaving her family? Every time Bran is thinking about how he misses his family, I\u2019m reminded that he disappears to become someone else. <b>What for?</b></p><h2>I re-read and re-watch LORD OF THE RINGS because it\u2019s a good story! It makes me smile.
