You were back and he was a little hurt that no one had told him or had to explain to him why you had been gone in the first place. You barely exchanged a word, you quickly looked at him before running out of the room.</p><p>Since then, he\u2019s been thinking a lot. He realized that your absence had been hurting him a lot, in a lot of different ways. He\u2019s been angrier lately, more tired too. He\u2019s been thinking of more often and less concentrated on his work. He\u2019s been wondering why you had left until he was thinking it was his fault. Well, you\u2019ve been avoiding him, so it should have been something he had said, no?</p><p>What has he done for you to avoid him? To disappear from his life? He had thought that you actually like him\u2026 To be sure and to stop the torment he\u2019d put himself in, he went to the Winchesters and demanded answers.</p><p>\u201cY/N has cancer.\u201d Sam finally admitted.</p><p>That was why Crowley was standing in this motel room with the boys, perfectly silent. The words seemed to not register at first in his confused and blurred out mind. He didn\u2019t want to admit that was what actually said Sam. He must have heard him wrong. It couldn\u2019t be.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He finally managed to ask. His voice was so full of worried and fear that he sounded strange to him.</p><p>\u201cShe has cancer. Brain cancer. Very rare, impossible to treat or to operate.\u201d Dean sighed. For once, he was feeling sympathy for the demon. He\u2019s been in the same state when you had told them the news. They knew you were ill, you were feeling strange and tired lately. That was why you had left, you were taking tests.</p><p>\u201cBut, how..\u201d Crowley stammered, he didn\u2019t really know what to say. \u201cHow can no one has ever seen it before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t know\u2026\u201d Sam sighed too. \u201cY/N\u2019s been feeling really tired lately and she was having blackout and blanks. So she went to see a doctor. That\u2019s why she disappeared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd no one can heal her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall you angel. He can save her.\u201d Crowley insisted. And right after the words fell from his mouth, an awkward silence fell in the room once more. \u201cWhat?\u201d He asked, confused, feeling that something was wrong.</p><p>\u201cY/N\u2026 She doesn\u2019t want to be saved or healed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe said that she didn\u2019t want to be healed. No angel\u2019s grace nor spell. She doesn\u2019t want to, and I\u2019m quoting her, be saved while others won\u2019t have the same luck as her\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t want to have privilege.\u201d</p><p>Crowley actually stayed speechless a moment. \u201cWh-what? But this is insane?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, right?\u201d Dean scoffed.</p><p>\u201cBut this is her choice, and we should respect it.\u201d Sam said wisely.</p><p>\u201cNo way.\u201d Crowley growled, before disappearing from the room. He reappeared a moment later outside of a bar, where he knew you were. He waited a moment for you to walked out. When you did, you immediately saw him and sighed, frustrated. It was easy to guess what he was here.</p><p>\u201cLet me guess, they told you.\u201d You stated, approaching him.</p><p>\u201cY/N, are you insane? Why would you refuse a chance like that? The angel in the trenchcoat could heal you in a matter of second.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that easy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe could make a deal. I could save you.\u201d</p><p>You stayed silent a moment too. Touched by the proposition. \u201cCrowley\u2026\u201d You sighed. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of you to propose this. I\u2019m touch, really. But I won\u2019t make a deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why? You\u2019re going to let yourself die?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t let that happen.\u201d</p><p>The day after that, he came back to you, proposing the same deal and you refused once again. The same pattern repeated itself for weeks. Crowley was desperate to make you accept. He didn\u2019t want you to die, he didn\u2019t want to lose you.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you doing this?\u201d He asked you once. He was standing in front of you, proposing the same deal to you once again.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to be saved, Crowley. I don\u2019t want to live knowing I\u2019ve been saved while others won\u2019t. I don\u2019t want to have this privilege. This is a chance for me to have a normal death. No demons, nor vampire. Just cancer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s crazy\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to die.\u201d He confessed suddenly, sadness overwhelming him.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to either. But this is what being Humans mean. We live and then we die.\u201d</p><p>Crowley didn\u2019t stop coming for you, he kept asking and asking again, hoping you will one day accept his deal. You never.</p><p>One day, Crowley\u2019s been summoned. When he appeared, he was surprised to see you. You were looking so weak. You were thin and pale. You looked tired too.</p><p>\u201cY/N?\u201d He asked, surprised to see you. He was surprised to see the state you were in too. And deeply, he was hoping that you would accept his deal, finally.</p><p>\u201cHi, Crowley.\u201d Your voice was as weak as you looked and it broke his heart.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you summoned me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was hoping to tell you goodbye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoodbye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s time Crowley, I can feel it. I\u2019m dying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He said desperately. You looked sadly at him and opened your arms. You hugged him tightly as tight as your weak arms would allow you. You face was hidden in the crook of his neck and you allowed some tears to run down your cheeks. You\u2019ve been so strong during all of this. You hide how afraid you were actually feeling. But tonight, it was the end and you could finally let it go.</p><p>Crowley hugged you tight too, hoping you were going to change your mind at the last minute. But then, he felt your body going limp in his arms and he felt your last breath on his neck.</p><p>\u201cY/N?\u201d He panicked, helping you safely to the ground. \u201cY/N!\u201d</p><p>Your eyes were closed, dried tears on your cheeks. Your skin was pale, and already getting cold. Crowley looked at you, letting his tears running down his face. He knew it was your choice, he knew you wanted this but he couldn\u2019t help but think that, as a crossroads demon, he had failed. He should have done this deal with you.</p><hr><p><b></b></p><p>FOREVER LIST</p><p><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJewJ4SOaShzXJWuID1zxUg\">@dekahg</a>\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mMeC_VjDvAm0oKhtQcTqp9Q\">@ria132love</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m9IG9or10RLaitEB164BUnw\">@emiwrites3reads</a>\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_W0q3yrHtoHcwFrp-qGEsQ\">@luciferstempest</a></p>",

You were back and he was a little hurt that no one had told him or had to explain to him why you had been gone in the first place. You barely exchanged a word, you quickly looked at him before running out of the room.</p><p>Since then, he\u2019s been thinking a lot. He realized that your absence had been hurting him a lot, in a lot of different ways. He\u2019s been angrier lately, more tired too. He\u2019s been thinking of more often and less concentrated on his work. He\u2019s been wondering why you had left until he was thinking it was his fault. Well, you\u2019ve been avoiding him, so it should have been something he had said, no?</p><p>What has he done for you to avoid him? To disappear from his life? He had thought that you actually like him\u2026 To be sure and to stop the torment he\u2019d put himself in, he went to the Winchesters and demanded answers.</p><p>\u201cY/N has cancer.\u201d Sam finally admitted.</p><p>That was why Crowley was standing in this motel room with the boys, perfectly silent. The words seemed to not register at first in his confused and blurred out mind. He didn\u2019t want to admit that was what actually said Sam. He must have heard him wrong. It couldn\u2019t be.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He finally managed to ask. His voice was so full of worried and fear that he sounded strange to him.</p><p>\u201cShe has cancer. Brain cancer. Very rare, impossible to treat or to operate.\u201d Dean sighed. For once, he was feeling sympathy for the demon. He\u2019s been in the same state when you had told them the news. They knew you were ill, you were feeling strange and tired lately. That was why you had left, you were taking tests.</p><p>\u201cBut, how..\u201d Crowley stammered, he didn\u2019t really know what to say. \u201cHow can no one has ever seen it before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t know\u2026\u201d Sam sighed too. \u201cY/N\u2019s been feeling really tired lately and she was having blackout and blanks. So she went to see a doctor. That\u2019s why she disappeared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd no one can heal her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall you angel. He can save her.\u201d Crowley insisted. And right after the words fell from his mouth, an awkward silence fell in the room once more. \u201cWhat?\u201d He asked, confused, feeling that something was wrong.</p><p>\u201cY/N\u2026 She doesn\u2019t want to be saved or healed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe said that she didn\u2019t want to be healed. No angel\u2019s grace nor spell. She doesn\u2019t want to, and I\u2019m quoting her, be saved while others won\u2019t have the same luck as her\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t want to have privilege.\u201d</p><p>Crowley actually stayed speechless a moment. \u201cWh-what? But this is insane?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, right?\u201d Dean scoffed.</p><p>\u201cBut this is her choice, and we should respect it.\u201d Sam said wisely.</p><p>\u201cNo way.\u201d Crowley growled, before disappearing from the room. He reappeared a moment later outside of a bar, where he knew you were. He waited a moment for you to walked out. When you did, you immediately saw him and sighed, frustrated. It was easy to guess what he was here.</p><p>\u201cLet me guess, they told you.\u201d You stated, approaching him.</p><p>\u201cY/N, are you insane? Why would you refuse a chance like that? The angel in the trenchcoat could heal you in a matter of second.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that easy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe could make a deal. I could save you.\u201d</p><p>You stayed silent a moment too. Touched by the proposition. \u201cCrowley\u2026\u201d You sighed. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of you to propose this. I\u2019m touch, really. But I won\u2019t make a deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why? You\u2019re going to let yourself die?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t let that happen.\u201d</p><p>The day after that, he came back to you, proposing the same deal and you refused once again. The same pattern repeated itself for weeks. Crowley was desperate to make you accept. He didn\u2019t want you to die, he didn\u2019t want to lose you.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you doing this?\u201d He asked you once. He was standing in front of you, proposing the same deal to you once again.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to be saved, Crowley. I don\u2019t want to live knowing I\u2019ve been saved while others won\u2019t. I don\u2019t want to have this privilege. This is a chance for me to have a normal death. No demons, nor vampire. Just cancer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s crazy\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to die.\u201d He confessed suddenly, sadness overwhelming him.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to either. But this is what being Humans mean. We live and then we die.\u201d</p><p>Crowley didn\u2019t stop coming for you, he kept asking and asking again, hoping you will one day accept his deal. You never.</p><p>One day, Crowley\u2019s been summoned. When he appeared, he was surprised to see you. You were looking so weak. You were thin and pale. You looked tired too.</p><p>\u201cY/N?\u201d He asked, surprised to see you. He was surprised to see the state you were in too. And deeply, he was hoping that you would accept his deal, finally.</p><p>\u201cHi, Crowley.\u201d Your voice was as weak as you looked and it broke his heart.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you summoned me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was hoping to tell you goodbye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoodbye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s time Crowley, I can feel it. I\u2019m dying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He said desperately. You looked sadly at him and opened your arms. You hugged him tightly as tight as your weak arms would allow you. You face was hidden in the crook of his neck and you allowed some tears to run down your cheeks. You\u2019ve been so strong during all of this. You hide how afraid you were actually feeling. But tonight, it was the end and you could finally let it go.</p><p>Crowley hugged you tight too, hoping you were going to change your mind at the last minute. But then, he felt your body going limp in his arms and he felt your last breath on his neck.</p><p>\u201cY/N?\u201d He panicked, helping you safely to the ground. \u201cY/N!\u201d</p><p>Your eyes were closed, dried tears on your cheeks. Your skin was pale, and already getting cold. Crowley looked at you, letting his tears running down his face. He knew it was your choice, he knew you wanted this but he couldn\u2019t help but think that, as a crossroads demon, he had failed. He should have done this deal with you.</p><hr><p><b></b></p><p>FOREVER LIST</p><p><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJewJ4SOaShzXJWuID1zxUg\">@dekahg</a>\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mMeC_VjDvAm0oKhtQcTqp9Q\">@ria132love</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m9IG9or10RLaitEB164BUnw\">@emiwrites3reads</a>\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_W0q3yrHtoHcwFrp-qGEsQ\">@luciferstempest</a></p></p>",

        "answer": "<p>Hi, anon.  You won\u2019t have found it in the book, because it\u2019s not in the book.  Here\u2019s the very short version: Neil mentioned in a blog post in early 2005 that he and Terry had recently met to catch up, and they had a conversation in which they mused on what Aziraphale and Crowley were up to.  Neil only quoted part of what they decided, namely that it involved them being in the South Downs.  A number of us on the lower_tadfield LJ community became wickedly curious about what they could possibly be doing.  When I learned both Neil and Terry would be doing readings/Q&amp;As in my then-city (Boston/Cambridge) in September that year, and within a week of each other, I snagged tickets to both events.  I promised the l_t folks that if I happened to get called on at both Q&amp;A sessions, I\u2019d ask each author the same question.
