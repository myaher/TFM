He looked over to Kirishima, who gave him a thumbs up for encouragement. However, it fell flat. He had already given up.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Fuck you,&rdquo; he settled. Then walked away.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Kirishima face-palmed while Midoriya wore a look mixed with shock and confusion.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, fuck it,&rdquo; mumbled Kirishima as he moved from his spot around the corner to sit next next to Midoriya, who was still in a slight daze.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Sup, Midoriya!&rdquo; he said while wrapping an arm around his shoulders and giving him a light pat.<br /></p><p>Midoriya snapped out of it.&nbsp;&ldquo;Oh, Kirishima!&rdquo; he smiled, then paused.&nbsp;&ldquo;Wait, you&rsquo;re his best friend,&rdquo; he mumbled, &ldquo;Do you happen to know if anything&rsquo;s going on with Kacchan?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Kirishima chuckled.&nbsp;&ldquo;Honestly? It has to do with you.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;What?? With me? Did I say, or, or do something? Crap, I should apologize-&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Woah, woah,&rdquo; interrupted Kirishima,&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to stop you right there. It&rsquo;s not that you did anything wrong.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Then what?&rdquo; asked Midoriya.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Kirishima sighed. He already knew this, but wanted to hear him say it. &ldquo;Do you&hellip; do you like him, Midoriya?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Of course I do.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;No, no, not like that,&rdquo; Kirishima shook his head.&nbsp;&ldquo;I mean, <i>like </i>like<i>&nbsp;</i>him. Like, wanna date him and all that.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I-<i>what?</i>&rdquo; he blushed.&nbsp;&ldquo;I-I mean,&rdquo; he looked down,&nbsp;&ldquo;maybe? yes? Why are asking?&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Kirishima smiled.&nbsp;&ldquo;I think you should tell him.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Midoriya stared blankly at his friend.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t look at me like that!&rdquo; yelled Kirishima.&nbsp;&ldquo;Really! I think you should!&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll kill me!&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;He won&rsquo;t!&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;How do you know that??&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Because-! Because&hellip; I just know.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;So when you said it had something to do with me, you don&rsquo;t mean he might&hellip; feel the same?&rdquo; asked Midoriya.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Kirishima sighed. He&rsquo;ll probably get yelled at for this, but there&rsquo;s no way Bakugou can do it on his own. He&rsquo;s tried, and failed, too many times. The redhead nodded to confirm Midoriya&rsquo;s theory.&nbsp;</p><p>Midoryia widened his eyes.&nbsp;&ldquo;That can&rsquo;t- there&rsquo;s no way.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Honestly, Midoriya, are you really that surprised?&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; he answered quickly.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Kirishima laughed.&nbsp;&ldquo;Well, I guess he is pretty shit with his feelings.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>A thought had just occurred to Midoriya.&nbsp;&ldquo;Wait, so just now. Was he?&rdquo; he couldn&rsquo;t finish.&nbsp;</p><p>Kirishima knew what he was about to ask. He nodded. &ldquo;He was trying to confess, again.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh&hellip;&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why, if you&rsquo;re serious about him, I think you should be the one.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Midoriya nodded.&nbsp;&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; he said&nbsp; before getting off the couch.&nbsp;&ldquo;I owe you!&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Kirishima shook his head.&nbsp;&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t owe me anything. Just keep him happy!&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah!&rdquo; exclaimed Midoriya as he headed to Bakugous floor.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Kirishima smiled. It&rsquo;ll be rough, the confession that is. But they&rsquo;ll find a way.&nbsp;</p></p>",

There&rsquo;s no reason to, is his logic. One time, these girls from general studies cornered Momo and started to bash on her, calling her &ldquo;slut&rdquo; or whatever name you could think of.
