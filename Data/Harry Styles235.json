Sitting down on Harry&rsquo;s sofa, you grabbed a tissue from the coffee table and wiped your eyes, handing one to Anne to.</p><p>\u00a0&quot;He&rsquo;s just beautiful Fliss, I&rsquo;m so happy for you both.&ldquo; She said, staring at Jacob, her face showing how proud she was to be his Grandma.</p><p>\u00a0&quot;I&rsquo;m so sorry Anne.&rdquo; You said, trying to keep back the tears that threatened to fall again.</p><p>\u00a0&quot;Don&rsquo;t be, and don&rsquo;t apologise again, it&rsquo;s forgotten ok?\u00a0&hellip;&hellip;forgotten&hellip;&hellip;.let&rsquo;s just look to the future. A future with you both here with us, in our family.&ldquo;\u00a0</p><p>She reached her free hand across and took your hand in hers.</p><p>&quot;I love you very much, you know that?&rdquo; She said in almost a whisper, desperately trying to hold herself together.</p><p>You nodded.</p><p>&ldquo;I love you to.&rdquo; You replied, squeezing her hand.</p><p>You heard Harry&rsquo;s footsteps coming along the hallway floor. You both looked up at hearing him come into the living room.</p><p>&ldquo;How long are you staying for Mum?!&rdquo; He laughed, looking back down the hall and the room suddenly filling with everyone&rsquo;s laughter.</p><p>&ldquo;Just two nights. Why?!&rdquo; She replied, wiping her eyes with a tissue.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got like, 4 bags!&rdquo; He said laughing.</p><p>&ldquo;Well one bag is my over night things, one is my hand bag and the other two are presents for my Grandson.&rdquo; She replied looking down at Jacob.</p><p>&ldquo;Any presents for me in their Mum, you know your baby boy?!&quot;\u00a0</p><p>&quot;Maybe one, most are for Jacob and Fliss.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Me?&rdquo; You asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, got you a little something.&rdquo; She said smiling.</p><p>The atmosphere in the room had rapidly changed, Anne still had your hand in hers but the tears you both had shed had disappeared.</p><p>\u00a0&quot;Get the kettle on then Harry.&ldquo; She said suddenly. &quot;Then we can open the presents I&rsquo;ve brought this beautiful boy.&rdquo;</p><p>\u00a0Harry chuckled as he made his way out of the living room and into the kitchen. You heard him fill the kettle and the familiar click of it being turned on.</p><p>\u00a0&quot;Anne, you didn&rsquo;t need to get us anything.&ldquo;</p><p>\u00a0&quot;Oh yes I did! This is my first grandchild, I want to spoil him rotten! And you of course.&rdquo; She replied smiling. &ldquo;He really is a beautiful boy isn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He is, and he&rsquo;s quite an easy baby, at the moment anyway!&rdquo; You laughed. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s very laid back, my Mum always said I was an easy baby.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Good, Harry was a fussy little thing, always needing to be cuddled.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I said that to Fliss yesterday.&rdquo; Harry answered, as he appeared from the kitchen.</p><p>\u00a0&quot;Gemma, however was easy, completely content all the time. Got more difficult as she grew up mind you.\u00a0 She was a stroppy teenager, still stroppy now!&ldquo;</p><!-- more --><p>\u00a0&quot;How are Gemma and Michal?&rdquo; You asked Anne.</p><p>\u00a0&quot;Both good, she&rsquo;s in L.A. promoting her sunglasses range, but will be back next week. She can&rsquo;t wait to see you both.&ldquo;</p><p>\u00a0Harry disappeared off again and returned a few minutes later with 3 cups of tea. Anne had began to ask you questions about Jacob and how your pregnancy and birth had gone. There was no judgement from her and you suddenly felt stupid at keeping everything from them. What sort of person were you to do that to them? Even with everything that had happened with Harry, finding out he&rsquo;d been unfaithful, him ending your relationship, you trying to help him when he was struggling with things, it still shouldn&rsquo;t have been something you kept from them.</p><p>You didn&rsquo;t deserve their understanding or their love, but yet here they were treating you with such love that you could feel the tears creeping up again. You took in a sharp breath, desperately trying to keep them held in. When Anne asked Harry to open the large Hessian bag and hand you the white box, you finally broke down. You knew what store the box was from, knew that it was a high end jewellery store. As you opened the box and revealed the beautiful white gold charm bracelet, you couldn&rsquo;t hold them back any longer. Hanging on the bracelet were three charms. Three letters; F, H and a J.</p><p>\u00a0&quot;Anne, this is beautiful&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;thankyou so much.&rdquo; You sobbed.</p><p>\u00a0She pulled you closer to her, and wrapped her free arm around you, embracing you in a warm hug.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s wonderful Mum, thankyou.&rdquo; Harry said, as he came closer to take a look. &ldquo;Shall I put it on for you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, please. &rdquo; You replied, wiping away your tears. You knew it would be emotional seeing Anne, but you&rsquo;d hardly stopped crying since she arrived. Harry took the bracelet from the box and placed it on your left wrist. It really was such a beautiful and thoughtful gift.</p><p>With your tears dried away and hot cups of tea in your hands, Anne indicated to Harry to open the presents in the bag. As Harry took out present after present for Jacob, your eyes widened.</p><p>&ldquo;Mum&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..have you no self control?!&rdquo; Harry laughed.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, I really really tried, but there were so many beautiful things!&rdquo; She laughed.</p><p>Once again Harry&rsquo;s comments had lightened the mood in the room. Anne had brought cute sets of dunagrees, vests, socks and babygros. The last present was a wooden box with separate compartments for his birth certificate, lock of hair, hospital bracelet, scan picture and new born picture.</p><p>&ldquo;Well we can add his birth certificate now we&rsquo;ve registered him this morning.&rdquo; Harry said.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, yes. How did that go?&rdquo; Anne asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, apart from being spotted and the staff being harassed by two fans after we left, it went well!&rdquo; You replied.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh&hellip;..&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all ok Mum, don&rsquo;t worry. We can however officially introduce Jacob Robin Styles to you. &rdquo; He replied slowly, and you knew he was hoping it wouldn&rsquo;t upset her, it was only just over a year since you&rsquo;d all lost Robin.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh Harry, Fliss&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.I don&rsquo;t know what to say&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;he would be so proud of Jacob having his name. Thank You both so much.&rdquo;</p><hr><p>Almost an hour of chatting went by before you decided to get some lunch started. Leaving Jacob safely snoozing in his Grandma Anne&rsquo;s arms, Harry and yourself began getting things together for some sandwiches and salad. You stood at the kitchen counter slicing some tomatoes and peppers when Harry came up behind you. Snaking his arms around you, he placed a kiss on the very top of your head.</p><p>&ldquo;You ok?&rdquo; He whispered, holding you close to his body.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, more than ok.&rdquo; You whispered back.</p><p>He moved his left hand from your waist, bringing it to rest across yours. His longer slender fingers found the bracelet he had placed there barely an hour ago.</p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe your Mum got me this.&quot;\u00a0</p><p>&quot;I know, but she always did love to spoil you.&rdquo; He replied smiling.</p><p>He delicately fiddled with the charms, running his thumb over each letter, before moving his fingers down and linking them with yours. He gave them a soft squeeze, before his thumb began running circles over your fourth finger.\u00a0</p><p>You tilted your head to look up at him, his beautiful green eyes locking with yours. Bringing his head down to reach yours, he placed a gentle kiss on your lips.\u00a0</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so happy you&rsquo;re here.&rdquo; He whispered.\u00a0</p><p>&ldquo;Me to.&rdquo; You whispered back.</p><hr><p>You had really missed Anne, she was such a wonderful person. She hadn&rsquo;t put Jacob down all day, apart from when she ate her lunch and you&rsquo;d fed him that afternoon. Sitting in the living room, listening to the radio and talking about anything and everything were things you&rsquo;d done plenty of times over the years. The conversation flowed and it honestly felt like you&rsquo;d never been apart from them all. You&rsquo;d had plenty of sneaky glances at Harry, when you&rsquo;d felt the burn of his gaze on you. An embarrassed smirk displaying his dimples at being caught yet again, was spread wide across his face.</p><p>He really was beautiful, you imagined that Jacob would grow up to as handsome as his Daddy.</p><p>You were startled from your day dream when Harry headed for the kitchen to get dinner started around 5pm. He gave your shoulder a loving squeeze as he&rsquo;d walked past, a smile appearing instantly on your lips at his touch. Anne&rsquo;s face lit up at the exchange.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"170\" data-orig-height=\"190\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/adf99a6d85089a253236b35b3b2b35ae/tumblr_inline_pesrtsN7bY1vq615k_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"170\" data-orig-height=\"190\"/></figure><p>With dinner consumed and the night drawing to a close, you fed Jacob before heading up to the spare room with him. Harry followed you up, the same way he had done the previous night, wanting to tuck Jacob into his moses basket.</p><p>Harry wrapped Jacob up in his swaddling cloth, kissing his forehead gently before placing him in his moses basket. He made sure his feet\u00a0were at the very bottom of the basket, like you had shown him before turning around to face you.</p><p>&ldquo;So, I think today went well. &quot;He whispered, a small smile on his face.</p><p>&quot;I would say so.&rdquo; You replied quietly.</p><p>&ldquo;How are you feeling about everything that&rsquo;s happening between us?&rdquo; He blurted out.</p><p>You hadn&rsquo;t expected him to ask you that. You weren&rsquo;t sure what conversation he would strike up with you, but it definitely wasn&rsquo;t that. You paused for a moment, trying to think about how you wanted to tell him how you felt.</p><p>\u00a0&quot;I don&rsquo;t want to rush things&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;a lot has happened. I can&rsquo;t forget &hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.what happened, what you did behind my back, I&rsquo;m guilty of lying to you to&hellip;&hellip;..but the last week had made me realise I don&rsquo;t want to throw away what we had.&ldquo;</p><p>&quot;I don&rsquo;t want to throw it away either, I was so fucking stupid. I&rsquo;m so sorry for how I treated you.&rdquo; He whispered, moving closer to you and reaching out to hold both your hands. &ldquo;This last week, has just been&hellip;&hellip;..just&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;amazing. I never stopped loving you, never. I shouldn&rsquo;t had made my career a priority. You stuck by me through everything and I should&rsquo;ve &hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.. I should&rsquo;ve treated you the way you deserve to be treated. I love you Fliss, I love you so much, you were, are, the best thing that has ever happened to me, and now you&rsquo;ve given me our son.&rdquo;</p><p>Your eyes had never left his throughout his declaration. You could see the desperate need in his eyes to tell you how he was feeling. Knowing you could never match his intense words, you let go of his hands and reached up to his face. &ldquo;I love you.&rdquo; You whispered as your lips ghosted his. He didn&rsquo;t waste another second and brought his lips closer to fully meet yours. Tugging you closer to him by your hips, the kiss was heated within seconds. The raw emotions of what he had said played out in the movements of your mouths. Dipping his tongue in and meeting yours, you moaned at the contact, your body heating up from the intensity of the kiss.</p><p>You moved away panting, your foreheads resting against each other, your fingers still behind his neck, running through his hair.</p><p>&ldquo;Lets just take one day at a time, yeah?&rdquo; He asked, his words coming out in short spurts as he tried to catch his breathe. You nodded in agreement, before he kissed your lips again in a slow good night kiss.</p><p>You&rsquo;d not been in bed long, only 10 minutes maybe when you realised you&rsquo;d left your phone downstairs. Careful not to wake a sleeping Jacob, you crept across the room. Your bedroom door was a jar when you approached it, opening it quietly and slipping out onto the landing.</p><p>&ldquo;So Jeff thinks you should just act like you have never been apart, just been keeping a low profile while Fliss was pregnant.&rdquo; You heard Anne ask Harry from the kitchen.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, I don&rsquo;t want to even think about these last 9 months we&rsquo;ve been apart. I don&rsquo;t want to even think about what she was going through alone.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Fliss is a strong, independent young woman, she&rsquo;s done such a wonderful job with Jacob. I couldn&rsquo;t be more proud of her, and you for how you&rsquo;ve dealt with it since you found out. &rdquo;</p><p>You felt flutters in your heart to hear Anne say she was proud of you, figuring out how to be a mother hadn&rsquo;t been easy, but you were getting there.</p><p>&ldquo;I feel complete with them Mum, like its something that I always needed in my life. Her and Jacob, my own little family.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;ve cut all contact with that God awful model?&rdquo; She asked coldly.</p><p>&ldquo;Of course, I felt physically sick when she was all over me the last time I saw her. She thought I wanted to meet up with her for, you know&hellip;&hellip;.stuff, but I just wanted to tell her to stop calling and to leave me alone. She kissed me and I pushed her away. Biggest mistake of my life was kissing her behind Fliss&rsquo; back.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Honestly Harry, I didn&rsquo;t know what to think when I found out. One minute you were asking me about your Grans engagement ring and then you were pictured kissing some floozy.&rdquo;</p><p>\u00a0You placed your hand across your mouth to cover the low gasp that fell from your lips. He had wanted to marry you.</p><p>&ldquo;I know, I just I don&rsquo;t know what I was thinking. Well&hellip;&hellip; I wasnt. Too busy not dealing with my emotions.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I was watching you both today&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;the spark between you is still there isn&rsquo;t it? &rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, it is. She wants to take things one step at a time, no time scale. Just go with the flow.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I agree with her, you&rsquo;ve got Jacob to think of now, don&rsquo;t rush anything ok? Although I did bring Grans ring with me, for safe keeping.&rdquo;</p><p>It was silent but you assumed Harry was nodding.</p><p>You heard Anne place her cup in the dishwasher and knew she&rsquo;d be coming up to bed. Creeping back into the bedroom you closed the door as it has been and climbed into bed. Your phone downstairs long forgotten as you delayed their conversation over in your head.</p><p><br/></p><p>Part Five</p><p><a href=\"https://niall-is-my-dream.tumblr.com/post/178780220458/light-of-my-life-part-five\">https://niall-is-my-dream.tumblr.com/post/178780220458/light-of-my-life-part-five</a><br/></p>",

A future with you both here with us, in our family.\u201c\u00a0</p><p>She reached her free hand across and took your hand in hers.</p><p>\"I love you very much, you know that?\u201d She said in almost a whisper, desperately trying to hold herself together.</p><p>You nodded.</p><p>\u201cI love you to.\u201d You replied, squeezing her hand.</p><p>You heard Harry\u2019s footsteps coming along the hallway floor. You both looked up at hearing him come into the living room.</p><p>\u201cHow long are you staying for Mum?!\u201d He laughed, looking back down the hall and the room suddenly filling with everyone\u2019s laughter.</p><p>\u201cJust two nights. Why?!\u201d She replied, wiping her eyes with a tissue.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got like, 4 bags!\u201d He said laughing.</p><p>\u201cWell one bag is my over night things, one is my hand bag and the other two are presents for my Grandson.\u201d She replied looking down at Jacob.</p><p>\u201cAny presents for me in their Mum, you know your baby boy?!\"\u00a0</p><p>\"Maybe one, most are for Jacob and Fliss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d You asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, got you a little something.\u201d She said smiling.</p><p>The atmosphere in the room had rapidly changed, Anne still had your hand in hers but the tears you both had shed had disappeared.</p><p>\u00a0\"Get the kettle on then Harry.\u201c She said suddenly. \"Then we can open the presents I\u2019ve brought this beautiful boy.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0Harry chuckled as he made his way out of the living room and into the kitchen. You heard him fill the kettle and the familiar click of it being turned on.</p><p>\u00a0\"Anne, you didn\u2019t need to get us anything.\u201c</p><p>\u00a0\"Oh yes I did!

Got more difficult as she grew up mind you.\u00a0 She was a stroppy teenager, still stroppy now!\u201c</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u00a0\"How are Gemma and Michal?\u201d You asked Anne.</p><p>\u00a0\"Both good, she\u2019s in L.A. promoting her sunglasses range, but will be back next week. She can\u2019t wait to see you both.\u201c</p><p>\u00a0Harry disappeared off again and returned a few minutes later with 3 cups of tea. Anne had began to ask you questions about Jacob and how your pregnancy and birth had gone. There was no judgement from her and you suddenly felt stupid at keeping everything from them. What sort of person were you to do that to them? Even with everything that had happened with Harry, finding out he\u2019d been unfaithful, him ending your relationship, you trying to help him when he was struggling with things, it still shouldn\u2019t have been something you kept from them.</p><p>You didn\u2019t deserve their understanding or their love, but yet here they were treating you with such love that you could feel the tears creeping up again. You took in a sharp breath, desperately trying to keep them held in. When Anne asked Harry to open the large Hessian bag and hand you the white box, you finally broke down. You knew what store the box was from, knew that it was a high end jewellery store. As you opened the box and revealed the beautiful white gold charm bracelet, you couldn\u2019t hold them back any longer. Hanging on the bracelet were three charms. Three letters; F, H and a J.</p><p>\u00a0\"Anne, this is beautiful\u2026\u2026\u2026thankyou so much.\u201d You sobbed.</p><p>\u00a0She pulled you closer to her, and wrapped her free arm around you, embracing you in a warm hug.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s wonderful Mum, thankyou.\u201d Harry said, as he came closer to take a look. \u201cShall I put it on for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, please. \u201d You replied, wiping away your tears. You knew it would be emotional seeing Anne, but you\u2019d hardly stopped crying since she arrived. Harry took the bracelet from the box and placed it on your left wrist. It really was such a beautiful and thoughtful gift.</p><p>With your tears dried away and hot cups of tea in your hands, Anne indicated to Harry to open the presents in the bag. As Harry took out present after present for Jacob, your eyes widened.</p><p>\u201cMum\u2026\u2026\u2026..have you no self control?!\u201d Harry laughed.</p><p>\u201cOh, I really really tried, but there were so many beautiful things!\u201d She laughed.</p><p>Once again Harry\u2019s comments had lightened the mood in the room. Anne had brought cute sets of dunagrees, vests, socks and babygros. The last present was a wooden box with separate compartments for his birth certificate, lock of hair, hospital bracelet, scan picture and new born picture.</p><p>\u201cWell we can add his birth certificate now we\u2019ve registered him this morning.\u201d Harry said.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes. How did that go?\u201d Anne asked.</p><p>\u201cWell, apart from being spotted and the staff being harassed by two fans after we left, it went well!\u201d You replied.</p><p>\u201cOh\u2026..\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all ok Mum, don\u2019t worry. We can however officially introduce Jacob Robin Styles to you. \u201d He replied slowly, and you knew he was hoping it wouldn\u2019t upset her, it was only just over a year since you\u2019d all lost Robin.</p><p>\u201cOh Harry, Fliss\u2026\u2026\u2026.I don\u2019t know what to say\u2026\u2026\u2026he would be so proud of Jacob having his name. Thank You both so much.\u201d</p><hr><p>Almost an hour of chatting went by before you decided to get some lunch started. Leaving Jacob safely snoozing in his Grandma Anne\u2019s arms, Harry and yourself began getting things together for some sandwiches and salad. You stood at the kitchen counter slicing some tomatoes and peppers when Harry came up behind you. Snaking his arms around you, he placed a kiss on the very top of your head.</p><p>\u201cYou ok?\u201d He whispered, holding you close to his body.</p><p>\u201cYeah, more than ok.\u201d You whispered back.</p><p>He moved his left hand from your waist, bringing it to rest across yours. His longer slender fingers found the bracelet he had placed there barely an hour ago.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe your Mum got me this.\"\u00a0</p><p>\"I know, but she always did love to spoil you.\u201d He replied smiling.</p><p>He delicately fiddled with the charms, running his thumb over each letter, before moving his fingers down and linking them with yours. He gave them a soft squeeze, before his thumb began running circles over your fourth finger.\u00a0</p><p>You tilted your head to look up at him, his beautiful green eyes locking with yours. Bringing his head down to reach yours, he placed a gentle kiss on your lips.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so happy you\u2019re here.\u201d He whispered.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cMe to.\u201d You whispered back.</p><hr><p>You had really missed Anne, she was such a wonderful person. She hadn\u2019t put Jacob down all day, apart from when she ate her lunch and you\u2019d fed him that afternoon. Sitting in the living room, listening to the radio and talking about anything and everything were things you\u2019d done plenty of times over the years. The conversation flowed and it honestly felt like you\u2019d never been apart from them all. You\u2019d had plenty of sneaky glances at Harry, when you\u2019d felt the burn of his gaze on you. An embarrassed smirk displaying his dimples at being caught yet again, was spread wide across his face.</p><p>He really was beautiful, you imagined that Jacob would grow up to as handsome as his Daddy.</p><p>You were startled from your day dream when Harry headed for the kitchen to get dinner started around 5pm. He gave your shoulder a loving squeeze as he\u2019d walked past, a smile appearing instantly on your lips at his touch. Anne\u2019s face lit up at the exchange.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"170\" data-orig-height=\"190\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/adf99a6d85089a253236b35b3b2b35ae/tumblr_inline_pesrtsN7bY1vq615k_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"170\" data-orig-height=\"190\"></figure><p>With dinner consumed and the night drawing to a close, you fed Jacob before heading up to the spare room with him. Harry followed you up, the same way he had done the previous night, wanting to tuck Jacob into his moses basket.</p><p>Harry wrapped Jacob up in his swaddling cloth, kissing his forehead gently before placing him in his moses basket. He made sure his feet\u00a0were at the very bottom of the basket, like you had shown him before turning around to face you.</p><p>\u201cSo, I think today went well. \"He whispered, a small smile on his face.</p><p>\"I would say so.\u201d You replied quietly.</p><p>\u201cHow are you feeling about everything that\u2019s happening between us?\u201d He blurted out.</p><p>You hadn\u2019t expected him to ask you that. You weren\u2019t sure what conversation he would strike up with you, but it definitely wasn\u2019t that. You paused for a moment, trying to think about how you wanted to tell him how you felt.</p><p>\u00a0\"I don\u2019t want to rush things\u2026\u2026\u2026a lot has happened. I can\u2019t forget \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.what happened, what you did behind my back, I\u2019m guilty of lying to you to\u2026\u2026..but the last week had made me realise I don\u2019t want to throw away what we had.\u201c</p><p>\"I don\u2019t want to throw it away either, I was so fucking stupid. I\u2019m so sorry for how I treated you.\u201d He whispered, moving closer to you and reaching out to hold both your hands. \u201cThis last week, has just been\u2026\u2026..just\u2026\u2026\u2026amazing. I never stopped loving you, never. I shouldn\u2019t had made my career a priority. You stuck by me through everything and I should\u2019ve \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.. I should\u2019ve treated you the way you deserve to be treated. I love you Fliss, I love you so much, you were, are, the best thing that has ever happened to me, and now you\u2019ve given me our son.\u201d</p><p>Your eyes had never left his throughout his declaration. You could see the desperate need in his eyes to tell you how he was feeling. Knowing you could never match his intense words, you let go of his hands and reached up to his face. \u201cI love you.\u201d You whispered as your lips ghosted his. He didn\u2019t waste another second and brought his lips closer to fully meet yours. Tugging you closer to him by your hips, the kiss was heated within seconds. The raw emotions of what he had said played out in the movements of your mouths. Dipping his tongue in and meeting yours, you moaned at the contact, your body heating up from the intensity of the kiss.</p><p>You moved away panting, your foreheads resting against each other, your fingers still behind his neck, running through his hair.</p><p>\u201cLets just take one day at a time, yeah?\u201d He asked, his words coming out in short spurts as he tried to catch his breathe. You nodded in agreement, before he kissed your lips again in a slow good night kiss.</p><p>You\u2019d not been in bed long, only 10 minutes maybe when you realised you\u2019d left your phone downstairs. Careful not to wake a sleeping Jacob, you crept across the room. Your bedroom door was a jar when you approached it, opening it quietly and slipping out onto the landing.</p><p>\u201cSo Jeff thinks you should just act like you have never been apart, just been keeping a low profile while Fliss was pregnant.\u201d You heard Anne ask Harry from the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I don\u2019t want to even think about these last 9 months we\u2019ve been apart. I don\u2019t want to even think about what she was going through alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFliss is a strong, independent young woman, she\u2019s done such a wonderful job with Jacob. I couldn\u2019t be more proud of her, and you for how you\u2019ve dealt with it since you found out. \u201d</p><p>You felt flutters in your heart to hear Anne say she was proud of you, figuring out how to be a mother hadn\u2019t been easy, but you were getting there.</p><p>\u201cI feel complete with them Mum, like its something that I always needed in my life. Her and Jacob, my own little family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019ve cut all contact with that God awful model?\u201d She asked coldly.</p><p>\u201cOf course, I felt physically sick when she was all over me the last time I saw her. She thought I wanted to meet up with her for, you know\u2026\u2026.stuff, but I just wanted to tell her to stop calling and to leave me alone. She kissed me and I pushed her away. Biggest mistake of my life was kissing her behind Fliss\u2019 back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHonestly Harry, I didn\u2019t know what to think when I found out. One minute you were asking me about your Grans engagement ring and then you were pictured kissing some floozy.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0You placed your hand across your mouth to cover the low gasp that fell from your lips. He had wanted to marry you.</p><p>\u201cI know, I just I don\u2019t know what I was thinking. Well\u2026\u2026 I wasnt. Too busy not dealing with my emotions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was watching you both today\u2026\u2026\u2026the spark between you is still there isn\u2019t it? \u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it is. She wants to take things one step at a time, no time scale. Just go with the flow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree with her, you\u2019ve got Jacob to think of now, don\u2019t rush anything ok? Although I did bring Grans ring with me, for safe keeping.\u201d</p><p>It was silent but you assumed Harry was nodding.</p><p>You heard Anne place her cup in the dishwasher and knew she\u2019d be coming up to bed. Creeping back into the bedroom you closed the door as it has been and climbed into bed. Your phone downstairs long forgotten as you delayed their conversation over in your head.</p><p><br></p><p>Part Five</p><p><a href=\"https://niall-is-my-dream.tumblr.com/post/178780220458/light-of-my-life-part-five\">https://niall-is-my-dream.tumblr.com/post/178780220458/light-of-my-life-part-five</a><br></p></p>",

You took in a sharp breath, desperately trying to keep them held in. When Anne asked Harry to open the large Hessian bag and hand you the white box, you finally broke down. You knew what store the box was from, knew that it was a high end jewellery store. As you opened the box and revealed the beautiful white gold charm bracelet, you couldn\u2019t hold them back any longer. Hanging on the bracelet were three charms. Three letters; F, H and a J.</p><p>\u00a0\"Anne, this is beautiful\u2026\u2026\u2026thankyou so much.\u201d You sobbed.</p><p>\u00a0She pulled you closer to her, and wrapped her free arm around you, embracing you in a warm hug.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s wonderful Mum, thankyou.\u201d Harry said, as he came closer to take a look. \u201cShall I put it on for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, please. \u201d You replied, wiping away your tears. You knew it would be emotional seeing Anne, but you\u2019d hardly stopped crying since she arrived. Harry took the bracelet from the box and placed it on your left wrist. It really was such a beautiful and thoughtful gift.</p><p>With your tears dried away and hot cups of tea in your hands, Anne indicated to Harry to open the presents in the bag. As Harry took out present after present for Jacob, your eyes widened.</p><p>\u201cMum\u2026\u2026\u2026..have you no self control?!\u201d Harry laughed.</p><p>\u201cOh, I really really tried, but there were so many beautiful things!\u201d She laughed.</p><p>Once again Harry\u2019s comments had lightened the mood in the room. Anne had brought cute sets of dunagrees, vests, socks and babygros. The last present was a wooden box with separate compartments for his birth certificate, lock of hair, hospital bracelet, scan picture and new born picture.</p><p>\u201cWell we can add his birth certificate now we\u2019ve registered him this morning.\u201d Harry said.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes. How did that go?\u201d Anne asked.</p><p>\u201cWell, apart from being spotted and the staff being harassed by two fans after we left, it went well!\u201d You replied.</p><p>\u201cOh\u2026..\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all ok Mum, don\u2019t worry. We can however officially introduce Jacob Robin Styles to you. \u201d He replied slowly, and you knew he was hoping it wouldn\u2019t upset her, it was only just over a year since you\u2019d all lost Robin.</p><p>\u201cOh Harry, Fliss\u2026\u2026\u2026.I don\u2019t know what to say\u2026\u2026\u2026he would be so proud of Jacob having his name. Thank You both so much.\u201d</p><hr><p>Almost an hour of chatting went by before you decided to get some lunch started. Leaving Jacob safely snoozing in his Grandma Anne\u2019s arms, Harry and yourself began getting things together for some sandwiches and salad. You stood at the kitchen counter slicing some tomatoes and peppers when Harry came up behind you. Snaking his arms around you, he placed a kiss on the very top of your head.</p><p>\u201cYou ok?\u201d He whispered, holding you close to his body.</p><p>\u201cYeah, more than ok.\u201d You whispered back.</p><p>He moved his left hand from your waist, bringing it to rest across yours. His longer slender fingers found the bracelet he had placed there barely an hour ago.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe your Mum got me this.\"\u00a0</p><p>\"I know, but she always did love to spoil you.\u201d He replied smiling.</p><p>He delicately fiddled with the charms, running his thumb over each letter, before moving his fingers down and linking them with yours. He gave them a soft squeeze, before his thumb began running circles over your fourth finger.\u00a0</p><p>You tilted your head to look up at him, his beautiful green eyes locking with yours. Bringing his head down to reach yours, he placed a gentle kiss on your lips.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so happy you\u2019re here.\u201d He whispered.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cMe to.\u201d You whispered back.</p><hr><p>You had really missed Anne, she was such a wonderful person. She hadn\u2019t put Jacob down all day, apart from when she ate her lunch and you\u2019d fed him that afternoon. Sitting in the living room, listening to the radio and talking about anything and everything were things you\u2019d done plenty of times over the years. The conversation flowed and it honestly felt like you\u2019d never been apart from them all. You\u2019d had plenty of sneaky glances at Harry, when you\u2019d felt the burn of his gaze on you. An embarrassed smirk displaying his dimples at being caught yet again, was spread wide across his face.</p><p>He really was beautiful, you imagined that Jacob would grow up to as handsome as his Daddy.</p><p>You were startled from your day dream when Harry headed for the kitchen to get dinner started around 5pm. He gave your shoulder a loving squeeze as he\u2019d walked past, a smile appearing instantly on your lips at his touch. Anne\u2019s face lit up at the exchange.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"170\" data-orig-height=\"190\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/adf99a6d85089a253236b35b3b2b35ae/tumblr_inline_pesrtsN7bY1vq615k_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"170\" data-orig-height=\"190\"></figure><p>With dinner consumed and the night drawing to a close, you fed Jacob before heading up to the spare room with him. Harry followed you up, the same way he had done the previous night, wanting to tuck Jacob into his moses basket.</p><p>Harry wrapped Jacob up in his swaddling cloth, kissing his forehead gently before placing him in his moses basket. He made sure his feet\u00a0were at the very bottom of the basket, like you had shown him before turning around to face you.</p><p>\u201cSo, I think today went well. \"He whispered, a small smile on his face.</p><p>\"I would say so.\u201d You replied quietly.</p><p>\u201cHow are you feeling about everything that\u2019s happening between us?\u201d He blurted out.</p><p>You hadn\u2019t expected him to ask you that. You weren\u2019t sure what conversation he would strike up with you, but it definitely wasn\u2019t that. You paused for a moment, trying to think about how you wanted to tell him how you felt.</p><p>\u00a0\"I don\u2019t want to rush things\u2026\u2026\u2026a lot has happened. I can\u2019t forget \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.what happened, what you did behind my back, I\u2019m guilty of lying to you to\u2026\u2026..but the last week had made me realise I don\u2019t want to throw away what we had.\u201c</p><p>\"I don\u2019t want to throw it away either, I was so fucking stupid. I\u2019m so sorry for how I treated you.\u201d He whispered, moving closer to you and reaching out to hold both your hands. \u201cThis last week, has just been\u2026\u2026..just\u2026\u2026\u2026amazing. I never stopped loving you, never. I shouldn\u2019t had made my career a priority. You stuck by me through everything and I should\u2019ve \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.. I should\u2019ve treated you the way you deserve to be treated. I love you Fliss, I love you so much, you were, are, the best thing that has ever happened to me, and now you\u2019ve given me our son.\u201d</p><p>Your eyes had never left his throughout his declaration. You could see the desperate need in his eyes to tell you how he was feeling. Knowing you could never match his intense words, you let go of his hands and reached up to his face. \u201cI love you.\u201d You whispered as your lips ghosted his. He didn\u2019t waste another second and brought his lips closer to fully meet yours. Tugging you closer to him by your hips, the kiss was heated within seconds. The raw emotions of what he had said played out in the movements of your mouths. Dipping his tongue in and meeting yours, you moaned at the contact, your body heating up from the intensity of the kiss.</p><p>You moved away panting, your foreheads resting against each other, your fingers still behind his neck, running through his hair.</p><p>\u201cLets just take one day at a time, yeah?\u201d He asked, his words coming out in short spurts as he tried to catch his breathe. You nodded in agreement, before he kissed your lips again in a slow good night kiss.</p><p>You\u2019d not been in bed long, only 10 minutes maybe when you realised you\u2019d left your phone downstairs. Careful not to wake a sleeping Jacob, you crept across the room. Your bedroom door was a jar when you approached it, opening it quietly and slipping out onto the landing.</p><p>\u201cSo Jeff thinks you should just act like you have never been apart, just been keeping a low profile while Fliss was pregnant.\u201d You heard Anne ask Harry from the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I don\u2019t want to even think about these last 9 months we\u2019ve been apart. I don\u2019t want to even think about what she was going through alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFliss is a strong, independent young woman, she\u2019s done such a wonderful job with Jacob. I couldn\u2019t be more proud of her, and you for how you\u2019ve dealt with it since you found out. \u201d</p><p>You felt flutters in your heart to hear Anne say she was proud of you, figuring out how to be a mother hadn\u2019t been easy, but you were getting there.</p><p>\u201cI feel complete with them Mum, like its something that I always needed in my life. Her and Jacob, my own little family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019ve cut all contact with that God awful model?\u201d She asked coldly.</p><p>\u201cOf course, I felt physically sick when she was all over me the last time I saw her. She thought I wanted to meet up with her for, you know\u2026\u2026.stuff, but I just wanted to tell her to stop calling and to leave me alone. She kissed me and I pushed her away. Biggest mistake of my life was kissing her behind Fliss\u2019 back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHonestly Harry, I didn\u2019t know what to think when I found out. One minute you were asking me about your Grans engagement ring and then you were pictured kissing some floozy.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0You placed your hand across your mouth to cover the low gasp that fell from your lips. He had wanted to marry you.</p><p>\u201cI know, I just I don\u2019t know what I was thinking. Well\u2026\u2026 I wasnt. Too busy not dealing with my emotions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was watching you both today\u2026\u2026\u2026the spark between you is still there isn\u2019t it? \u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it is. She wants to take things one step at a time, no time scale. Just go with the flow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree with her, you\u2019ve got Jacob to think of now, don\u2019t rush anything ok? Although I did bring Grans ring with me, for safe keeping.\u201d</p><p>It was silent but you assumed Harry was nodding.</p><p>You heard Anne place her cup in the dishwasher and knew she\u2019d be coming up to bed. Creeping back into the bedroom you closed the door as it has been and climbed into bed. Your phone downstairs long forgotten as you delayed their conversation over in your head.</p><p><br></p><p>Part Five</p><p><a href=\"https://niall-is-my-dream.tumblr.com/post/178780220458/light-of-my-life-part-five\">https://niall-is-my-dream.tumblr.com/post/178780220458/light-of-my-life-part-five</a><br></p></p>",

Sitting down on Harry&rsquo;s sofa, you grabbed a tissue from the coffee table and wiped your eyes, handing one to Anne to.</p><p>&nbsp;\"He&rsquo;s just beautiful Fliss, I&rsquo;m so happy for you both.&ldquo; She said, staring at Jacob, her face showing how proud she was to be his Grandma.</p><p>&nbsp;\"I&rsquo;m so sorry Anne.&rdquo; You said, trying to keep back the tears that threatened to fall again.</p><p>&nbsp;\"Don&rsquo;t be, and don&rsquo;t apologise again, it&rsquo;s forgotten ok?&nbsp;&hellip;&hellip;forgotten&hellip;&hellip;.let&rsquo;s just look to the future. A future with you both here with us, in our family.&ldquo;&nbsp;</p><p>She reached her free hand across and took your hand in hers.</p><p>\"I love you very much, you know that?&rdquo; She said in almost a whisper, desperately trying to hold herself together.</p><p>You nodded.</p><p>&ldquo;I love you to.&rdquo; You replied, squeezing her hand.</p><p>You heard Harry&rsquo;s footsteps coming along the hallway floor. You both looked up at hearing him come into the living room.</p><p>&ldquo;How long are you staying for Mum?!&rdquo; He laughed, looking back down the hall and the room suddenly filling with everyone&rsquo;s laughter.</p><p>&ldquo;Just two nights. Why?!&rdquo; She replied, wiping her eyes with a tissue.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got like, 4 bags!&rdquo; He said laughing.</p><p>&ldquo;Well one bag is my over night things, one is my hand bag and the other two are presents for my Grandson.&rdquo; She replied looking down at Jacob.</p><p>&ldquo;Any presents for me in their Mum, you know your baby boy?!\"&nbsp;</p><p>\"Maybe one, most are for Jacob and Fliss.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Me?&rdquo; You asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, got you a little something.&rdquo; She said smiling.</p><p>The atmosphere in the room had rapidly changed, Anne still had your hand in hers but the tears you both had shed had disappeared.</p><p>&nbsp;\"Get the kettle on then Harry.&ldquo; She said suddenly. \"Then we can open the presents I&rsquo;ve brought this beautiful boy.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;Harry chuckled as he made his way out of the living room and into the kitchen. You heard him fill the kettle and the familiar click of it being turned on.</p><p>&nbsp;\"Anne, you didn&rsquo;t need to get us anything.&ldquo;</p><p>&nbsp;\"Oh yes I did! This is my first grandchild, I want to spoil him rotten! And you of course.&rdquo; She replied smiling. &ldquo;He really is a beautiful boy isn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He is, and he&rsquo;s quite an easy baby, at the moment anyway!&rdquo; You laughed. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s very laid back, my Mum always said I was an easy baby.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Good, Harry was a fussy little thing, always needing to be cuddled.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I said that to Fliss yesterday.&rdquo; Harry answered, as he appeared from the kitchen.</p><p>&nbsp;\"Gemma, however was easy, completely content all the time. Got more difficult as she grew up mind you.&nbsp; She was a stroppy teenager, still stroppy now!&ldquo;</p><p>&nbsp;\"How are Gemma and Michal?&rdquo; You asked Anne.</p><p>&nbsp;\"Both good, she&rsquo;s in L.A. promoting her sunglasses range, but will be back next week. She can&rsquo;t wait to see you both.&ldquo;</p><p>&nbsp;Harry disappeared off again and returned a few minutes later with 3 cups of tea. Anne had began to ask you questions about Jacob and how your pregnancy and birth had gone. There was no judgement from her and you suddenly felt stupid at keeping everything from them. What sort of person were you to do that to them? Even with everything that had happened with Harry, finding out he&rsquo;d been unfaithful, him ending your relationship, you trying to help him when he was struggling with things, it still shouldn&rsquo;t have been something you kept from them.</p><p>You didn&rsquo;t deserve their understanding or their love, but yet here they were treating you with such love that you could feel the tears creeping up again.

Sitting down on Harry&rsquo;s sofa, you grabbed a tissue from the coffee table and wiped your eyes, handing one to Anne to.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;\"He&rsquo;s just beautiful Fliss, I&rsquo;m so happy for you both.&ldquo; She said, staring at Jacob, her face showing how proud she was to be his Grandma.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;\"I&rsquo;m so sorry Anne.&rdquo; You said, trying to keep back the tears that threatened to fall again.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;\"Don&rsquo;t be, and don&rsquo;t apologise again, it&rsquo;s forgotten ok?&nbsp;&hellip;&hellip;forgotten&hellip;&hellip;.let&rsquo;s just look to the future. A future with you both here with us, in our family.&ldquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>She reached her free hand across and took your hand in hers.</p>\n<p>\"I love you very much, you know that?&rdquo; She said in almost a whisper, desperately trying to hold herself together.</p>\n<p>You nodded.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I love you to.&rdquo; You replied, squeezing her hand.</p>\n<p>You heard Harry&rsquo;s footsteps coming along the hallway floor. You both looked up at hearing him come into the living room.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;How long are you staying for Mum?!&rdquo; He laughed, looking back down the hall and the room suddenly filling with everyone&rsquo;s laughter.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Just two nights. Why?!&rdquo; She replied, wiping her eyes with a tissue.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got like, 4 bags!&rdquo; He said laughing.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Well one bag is my over night things, one is my hand bag and the other two are presents for my Grandson.&rdquo; She replied looking down at Jacob.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Any presents for me in their Mum, you know your baby boy?!\"&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\"Maybe one, most are for Jacob and Fliss.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Me?&rdquo; You asked.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Yes, got you a little something.&rdquo; She said smiling.</p>\n<p>The atmosphere in the room had rapidly changed, Anne still had your hand in hers but the tears you both had shed had disappeared.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;\"Get the kettle on then Harry.&ldquo; She said suddenly. \"Then we can open the presents I&rsquo;ve brought this beautiful boy.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Harry chuckled as he made his way out of the living room and into the kitchen. You heard him fill the kettle and the familiar click of it being turned on.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;\"Anne, you didn&rsquo;t need to get us anything.&ldquo;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;\"Oh yes I did! This is my first grandchild, I want to spoil him rotten! And you of course.&rdquo; She replied smiling. &ldquo;He really is a beautiful boy isn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;He is, and he&rsquo;s quite an easy baby, at the moment anyway!&rdquo; You laughed. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s very laid back, my Mum always said I was an easy baby.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Good, Harry was a fussy little thing, always needing to be cuddled.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I said that to Fliss yesterday.&rdquo; Harry answered, as he appeared from the kitchen.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;\"Gemma, however was easy, completely content all the time. Got more difficult as she grew up mind you.&nbsp; She was a stroppy teenager, still stroppy now!&ldquo;</p>\n</p>",
