He had been watching her for weeks the first few days the plan was to follower her and eat her simple as that. But after a while, the plan flew out the window and he was just watching her. He didn\u2019t know why there were plenty of opportunities to eat her he just couldn\u2019t bring himself to do it.</p><p>Maybe it was the way she smelled it\u2019s what attracted her to him at first but after some time it wasn\u2019t as mouth-watering anymore but soothing and calming yet still addictive. Maybe it was her voice it drew him in by now he couldn\u2019t pull away, she hummed to work every day. Maybe it was her looks at first she looked delicious now she looked beautiful. Maybe it was her personality at first she was a dumb ditsy human girl now she was positive, caring, shy, an innocent girl.</p><p>She was no longer food but a girl, a beautiful innocent girl that had unfortunately got his attention. But then again it wasn\u2019t a bad thing he watched out for her and kept her out of harm&rsquo;s way at a distance. Other ghouls would try to get her he\u2019d put them in their place or kill them. Mugger tries to mug her they became Suga\u2019s dinner.</p><p>He was her guardian demon<i> ( see what I did there)</i> watching over her as she went through life. </p><!-- more --><p>(y/n) was well aware of the eyes that followed her every day. When she first noticed it she was scared she was terrified ended up buying a Taser and pepper spray and started talking on the phone a friend when she walked home. She took all the precautions necessary but didn\u2019t stop her daily routine she wasn\u2019t going to let a little paranoia stop the pep in her step.</p><p>After a while (y/n) got used to the mysterious figure following her it became part of her everyday routine. She would literally wait by her front door until she felt eyes on her before going to work. The eyes became somewhat relaxing and reassuring. After a while, she stopped calling her friend and left her pepper spray and Taser at home.</p><p>It all most felt like a guardian angel was watching over her.</p><p>-</p><p>\u201cHello, Good morning\u201d (y/n) said as she took a seat at her desk getting ready for the day&rsquo;s work. </p><p>\u201cGood morning (y/n)\u201d her coworker said before dropping a load of work on her desk she was pretty sure 75% of this work was actually her seeing ass he never really worked unless the boss came through. But (y/n) didn\u2019t say anything she was too sweet and it was the usual daily routine. She right to work.</p><p>(y/n) didn\u2019t have many friends. She had one friend, more like one person she spoke to on the regular, She wasn\u2019t a very good friend. She offends forced her to go out and drink, as well as take her places, and do her work. Lori was her name and she basically forced herself into (y/n)\u2019s life and (y/n) was to kind to kick her out she just dealt with it she had no one else but her cat Sebastian.</p><p>\u201c(Y/N)\u201d Lori screamed in her ear she had unfortunately fallen asleep at her desk once she had finished all her work. \u201cwhat are you doing silly?\u201d</p><p>\u201ctaking a nap, I\u2019m sorry\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou apologize too much. What are you doing tomorrow night- You know what I already know what you\u2019re doing tonight Staying at home is boring. Change those plans you\u2019re going out with me and my friends tomorrow night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually I was going to-\u201d</p><p>\u201cno, you\u2019re not. You\u2019re going to put something tight on and you\u2019re partying with me\u201d</p><p>\u201cbut I-\u201d</p><p>\u201cno buts \u201c and with that Lori walked off not giving (y/n) a chance to say no and tell her how important tonight was Just demanding her presences, demanded her attention. (y/n) sighed knowing she would be upsetting someone tonight but not knowing who.</p><p>Today was the anniversary of (y/n)\u2019s father\u2019s death. Every year on this very day (y/n) would have dinner with her father\u2019s best friend, who she preferred to call Uncle, and they\u2019d just celebrate her fathers&rsquo; life and visit his grave. It was a tradition and they had done it every year since his death. Not one dinner was missed not one celebration was ruined or reschedule and that wasn\u2019t going to happen now.</p><p>(y/n) left her work at her usual time and Suga was waiting for her. He instantly knew something was wrong when she walked out of her office not humming or singing her usual tone. She was slumped not looking up admiring the lights and the people like she usually did. Something was wrong and Suga automatically knew. So was upset and distracted which was very dangerous because I distracted (y/n) never paid attention.</p><p>Doing his usual routine Suga followed (y/n) from rooftops and across the street everything was fine going neither of them having to look where they\u2019re going to use to this walk home. But (y/n) probably should have had her eyes up as she crossed the street. She didn\u2019t look up as she crossed the street eyes still down she didn\u2019t see the oncoming car with the texting driver. Not really thinking Suga just jumped into action. </p><p>(y/n) was suddenly pulled from her thoughts as she felt the wind being knocked out of her and felt herself flying through the air in a tackle. She gasped as she fell hearing the screeching tires fly by. The driver didn\u2019t even stop.</p><p>\u201cThat car was going to hit you,\u201d The stranger said laying under (y/n)</p><p>\u201cThank you so much. Thank you, Thank you\u201d she said hugging the stranger and sitting up. She had no injuries as they fell he twisted so she would fall on his chest and he would receive any and all injuries as well as be her cushion. </p><p>\u201cyou should watch where you\u2019re going,\u201d Suga said as they both stood up he dusted himself off and checked her for any injuries. \u201cUm&hellip; When that car was coming you looked upset you weren\u2019t paying attention. Is there something wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m doing fine thank you. I\u2019m sorry I don\u2019t feel comfortable telling strangers by problems. Even if you did say me. Thank you again by the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuga\u201d he held out his hand (y/n) hesitated for a moment before taking it and introducing herself \u201c now we\u2019re not strangers \u201c</p><p>\u201cI guess not\u201d.</p><p>And with that Suga offered to walk her home and hear about her problems. For some reason (y/n) felt completely comfortable with this stranger and told him everything without holding anything back.</p><p>Suga was listening to her every word but on the inside, he was beating himself up. He was not supposed to interact with her he wasn&rsquo;t supposed to mean or touch her but here he was walking her home. This was something ghouls did not do he was going to take her home and make sure she was safe whereas other followed them prey and ate them. With how good she smelted Suga that he would show his true nature any minute and eat her but he didn\u2019t.</p><p>He walked her all the way home. </p><p>\u201cUm&hellip;This is&hellip; thank you for walking me home \u201c</p><p>\u201cno problem\u201d he was holding back his hunger</p><p>\u201cUm &hellip;I was thinking&hellip;um\u201d</p><p>\u201cwhat are you doing tomorrow?\u201d his hunger was getting worse but his feet were planted in that one spot and his mouth was moving on its own.</p><p>\u201cI have plans that night but I\u2019m free most of the day\u201d</p><p>\u201ccan I take you out to lunch?\u201d Jesus christ he had no clue what he was doing anymore he was just doing it</p><p>\u201cyes I\u2019d - I\u2019d like that very much\u201d</p><p>\u201cmeet at the coffee shop on the corner at 12\u2033 As he walked away he slipped a paper with his number in her hand. when the hell did he write it down. He was breaking all the rules getting himself into some deep shit that he honestly shouldn\u2019t have been messing with in the first place. </p><p>On his way home Suga stopped and masked himself for a hunt he got two kills. He found them in a back alley cornering some poor young girl no older than 15. He heard the cruel descriptions they gave the girl promising to rape and killer her. He knocked the two guys out and told the girl to run home when he was sure she was gone for good is when he actually killed and ate them. He packed the leftovers. It wasn\u2019t until he got home that he realized what he had done he saved the girl any other time he would have killed her but tonight he saved some strange girl.</p><p>What was happening to him?</p><p>This girl was changing him.</p><p>-</p><p>\u201cwhat am I doing?\u201d Suga whispered shouted at himself as he sat on the bench watching out for (y/n) they texted all night and now they were meeting up for some lunch. Suga knew he was stepping way out of line and putting both of them at risk but he couldn\u2019t stop himself he just had to have her and not in the ghoul way the human way.</p><p>\u201cHi\u201d (y/n) said snapping him out of his thoughts he stood to greet her all bad thoughts gone it was just her now.</p><p>-</p><p>He was in a trance he was just mesmerized by her&hellip;everything, literally. He leaned for on his hands as she talked about random stuff his food half touched if she asked he\u2019d say he wasn\u2019t that hungry or she was more interesting. Lunch was great afterward they went for a walk in the park she was still talking and he was still listening.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I\u2019ve been rambling I talk too much. I\u2019m so sorry\u201d </p><p>\u201cit\u2019s okay\u201d he laughed \u201c It\u2019s okay I enjoy listening to you talking I like learning about you. I could listen to you all day\u201d</p><p>She blushed \u201c well you basically know everything about me. What about you tell me something interesting\u201d. And he did he was careful enough not to mention everything about him being a ghoul or having ghoul connections but he did tell her about him overall. About his passion for music and dancing about his friends who he considered brothers and the business, they ran together. He talked about his blood family who unfortunately was no longer around they were killed by CCG, he told her they were killed and nothing more. He told her almost everything and she listens.</p><p>(y/n) did listen she listen so well she noticed how sometimes he retracted his statement, pause, or suddenly changed the topic. She knew that some of the things he was say were exaggerated or had more details but she didn\u2019t question or push him he would tell when he was ready.</p><p>By the time they made it back to her apartment they practically knew everything about each other. The sun was setting and they felt like they were longtime friends or more.</p><p>\u201cI had fun today\u201d (y/n) said fidgeting with her keys </p><p>\u201cMaybe we could do it again\u201d Suga and he stepped closer to her \u201cwhen are you free again\u201d</p><p>\u201ctomorrow and any night next week\u201d she looked at his lips they were so kissable.</p><p>\u201cThen I guess I\u2019ll be taking you out every night next week\u201d he looked at her lips he just had to have them. Not even asking, he didn\u2019t have the patients for an answer, he took her lips in a kiss (y/n) instantly wrapped her arms around him and pulled him closer he wrapped his arms around her waist.</p><p>She tasted so good he imagined what she would taste like and this was ten times better. He didn\u2019t want to let up he wanted all of her. This was something he never felt before with someone he never expected to feel it with. It was like a breath of fresh air for the first time since meeting her his heart was clam he was relaxed and okay with what he was doing. It was just perfected.</p><p>(y/n) moaned as her head hit her apartment door. She hadn\u2019t been in a relationship for a few years and even then she had never kissed anybody like this before she had never felt like this with anybody before. Everything was new but she liked it. Suga was different new and she liked him.</p><p>\u201cWell damn\u201d they pulled apart to see Lori (y/n)\u2019s horrible co-worker, yes she informed Suga of her. \u201cThis is why you tried to blow me off. Hot diggity damn all is forgiven.\u201d</p><p>Suga and (y/n) expression was very unamused.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Lori. (y/n)\u2019s friend from work\u201d Lori held out her hand and gave a very seducing smile and pushing up her breast a bit trying to get his attention. (y/n) really wanted to smack some scene into her telling her they weren\u2019t friends and she needed to go but she was too sweet to do so.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Suga\u201d he didn\u2019t he even look at her hand. Honestly, these were the time of easy woman Suga sank his teeth into they were so easy to get.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m&hellip; I\u2019m (y/n)\u2019s boyfriend\u201d he didn\u2019t know what lead him to say that but he did he looked at (y/n) for any protest or disgust, had he gone too far they were just kissing, but he found none she was just smiling and blushing looking down at their laced fingers.</p><p>\u201cMy boyfriend\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh really, how long as this been going on?\u201d Lori asked suspiciously </p><p>\u201clong enough,\u201d Suga said. He turned to (y/n) cupping her face and giving her a peck on the lips. \u201c I come back for you tomorrow. Enjoy your dinner with your Uncle\u201d.</p><p>Suga waited until (y/n) was safely in her apartment to leave. As he left her apartment building he could still hear Lori bagging on (y/n)\u2019s door. He took a picture of her and sent it to his brother V she\u2019d be dead by the end of next week.</p><p>Man, Suga was trying to like breaking the rule.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><hr><h2>Request tags and/or stories up to anything<strike> (within reason)</strike></h2><p><b>permanent tags</b></p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m0KE-PfiyKEnj8gdJC8CZ3g\">@lovely-lollipops-blog</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mDIHXsiwqOsA4KJnAuoywyA\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mDIHXsiwqOsA4KJnAuoywyA\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mDIHXsiwqOsA4KJnAuoywyA\">@totallyweirdsam</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m1O6PvtvFUaAwZR_iddXh8w\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m1O6PvtvFUaAwZR_iddXh8w\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m1O6PvtvFUaAwZR_iddXh8w\">@sexysamsungl</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mkyK0Jnq22rmHqHt-jHZo_A\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mkyK0Jnq22rmHqHt-jHZo_A\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mkyK0Jnq22rmHqHt-jHZo_A\">@lilylovelyxo</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfJ5wdgylCm4q3jyeBPb8cg\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfJ5wdgylCm4q3jyeBPb8cg\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfJ5wdgylCm4q3jyeBPb8cg\">@iamwarrenspeace</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrwMU-N1eyWBqA1K5ic9qWQ\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrwMU-N1eyWBqA1K5ic9qWQ\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrwMU-N1eyWBqA1K5ic9qWQ\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrwMU-N1eyWBqA1K5ic9qWQ\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrwMU-N1eyWBqA1K5ic9qWQ\">@geeksareunique</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mzajidgNJQIVOZvIzFPECiw\">@that-random-emu</a> <strike>@supreme-leader-jazlo-ren</strike> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYp8pGzF4pBII8oS8anN9_A\">@stone2576</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m9adGWBt3jMGa0aLtsEZOsw\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m9adGWBt3jMGa0aLtsEZOsw\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m9adGWBt3jMGa0aLtsEZOsw\">@lil-dino-trash</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mDDfSP29VhliVU--5ZTi9Og\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mDDfSP29VhliVU--5ZTi9Og\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mDDfSP29VhliVU--5ZTi9Og\">@metal-armed-dino</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mLqDqq50G89LOMchKwY7bTw\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mLqDqq50G89LOMchKwY7bTw\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mLqDqq50G89LOMchKwY7bTw\">@dylanobrienmoviekid</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mevyaZrgR8GtBkdROGoPYAw\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mevyaZrgR8GtBkdROGoPYAw\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mevyaZrgR8GtBkdROGoPYAw\">@theshortegg</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m0T9-sijt6TGnAND-_ni2wA\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m0T9-sijt6TGnAND-_ni2wA\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m0T9-sijt6TGnAND-_ni2wA\">@dontevenblink-badwolf-tardis</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/msMMjrkBAYPWvSqoXmZTzbw\">@mandylove1000</a>\u00a0 <strike>@isnotashtonstan </strike><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mx9FnrjZyI4lP4VUlgOzJHQ\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mx9FnrjZyI4lP4VUlgOzJHQ\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mx9FnrjZyI4lP4VUlgOzJHQ\">@broitsmydick</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mG9WcKvRlNkkS5eAeoKXlhg\">@onceaballeralwaysaballer1213</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mwvgKcJQ1BnkS7DQBhDEqag\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mwvgKcJQ1BnkS7DQBhDEqag\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mwvgKcJQ1BnkS7DQBhDEqag\">@mypage-myfandoms</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mbzvadFMc_goTWINhRBruvw\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mbzvadFMc_goTWINhRBruvw\">@jordynhartley2001</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m5UHoCdiFhHs8K5SSWknWRw\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m5UHoCdiFhHs8K5SSWknWRw\">@midnightdream83</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mChCVQGM7q310lcogWm0D0w\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mChCVQGM7q310lcogWm0D0w\">@cookies186</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mLqDqq50G89LOMchKwY7bTw\">@i-am-marvel-trash-forever</a></p>",

She would literally wait by her front door until she felt eyes on her before going to work. The eyes became somewhat relaxing and reassuring. After a while, she stopped calling her friend and left her pepper spray and Taser at home.</p><p>It all most felt like a guardian angel was watching over her.</p><p>-</p><p>\u201cHello, Good morning\u201d (y/n) said as she took a seat at her desk getting ready for the day\u2019s work. </p><p>\u201cGood morning (y/n)\u201d her coworker said before dropping a load of work on her desk she was pretty sure 75% of this work was actually her seeing ass he never really worked unless the boss came through. But (y/n) didn\u2019t say anything she was too sweet and it was the usual daily routine. She right to work.</p><p>(y/n) didn\u2019t have many friends. She had one friend, more like one person she spoke to on the regular, She wasn\u2019t a very good friend. She offends forced her to go out and drink, as well as take her places, and do her work. Lori was her name and she basically forced herself into (y/n)\u2019s life and (y/n) was to kind to kick her out she just dealt with it she had no one else but her cat Sebastian.</p><p>\u201c(Y/N)\u201d Lori screamed in her ear she had unfortunately fallen asleep at her desk once she had finished all her work. \u201cwhat are you doing silly?\u201d</p><p>\u201ctaking a nap, I\u2019m sorry\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou apologize too much. What are you doing tomorrow night- You know what I already know what you\u2019re doing tonight Staying at home is boring. Change those plans you\u2019re going out with me and my friends tomorrow night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually I was going to-\u201d</p><p>\u201cno, you\u2019re not. You\u2019re going to put something tight on and you\u2019re partying with me\u201d</p><p>\u201cbut I-\u201d</p><p>\u201cno buts \u201c and with that Lori walked off not giving (y/n) a chance to say no and tell her how important tonight was Just demanding her presences, demanded her attention. (y/n) sighed knowing she would be upsetting someone tonight but not knowing who.</p><p>Today was the anniversary of (y/n)\u2019s father\u2019s death. Every year on this very day (y/n) would have dinner with her father\u2019s best friend, who she preferred to call Uncle, and they\u2019d just celebrate her fathers\u2019 life and visit his grave. It was a tradition and they had done it every year since his death. Not one dinner was missed not one celebration was ruined or reschedule and that wasn\u2019t going to happen now.</p><p>(y/n) left her work at her usual time and Suga was waiting for her. He instantly knew something was wrong when she walked out of her office not humming or singing her usual tone. She was slumped not looking up admiring the lights and the people like she usually did. Something was wrong and Suga automatically knew. So was upset and distracted which was very dangerous because I distracted (y/n) never paid attention.</p><p>Doing his usual routine Suga followed (y/n) from rooftops and across the street everything was fine going neither of them having to look where they\u2019re going to use to this walk home. But (y/n) probably should have had her eyes up as she crossed the street. She didn\u2019t look up as she crossed the street eyes still down she didn\u2019t see the oncoming car with the texting driver. Not really thinking Suga just jumped into action. </p><p>(y/n) was suddenly pulled from her thoughts as she felt the wind being knocked out of her and felt herself flying through the air in a tackle. She gasped as she fell hearing the screeching tires fly by. The driver didn\u2019t even stop.</p><p>\u201cThat car was going to hit you,\u201d The stranger said laying under (y/n)</p><p>\u201cThank you so much. Thank you, Thank you\u201d she said hugging the stranger and sitting up. She had no injuries as they fell he twisted so she would fall on his chest and he would receive any and all injuries as well as be her cushion. </p><p>\u201cyou should watch where you\u2019re going,\u201d Suga said as they both stood up he dusted himself off and checked her for any injuries. \u201cUm\u2026 When that car was coming you looked upset you weren\u2019t paying attention. Is there something wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m doing fine thank you. I\u2019m sorry I don\u2019t feel comfortable telling strangers by problems. Even if you did say me. Thank you again by the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuga\u201d he held out his hand (y/n) hesitated for a moment before taking it and introducing herself \u201c now we\u2019re not strangers \u201c</p><p>\u201cI guess not\u201d.</p><p>And with that Suga offered to walk her home and hear about her problems. For some reason (y/n) felt completely comfortable with this stranger and told him everything without holding anything back.</p><p>Suga was listening to her every word but on the inside, he was beating himself up. He was not supposed to interact with her he wasn\u2019t supposed to mean or touch her but here he was walking her home. This was something ghouls did not do he was going to take her home and make sure she was safe whereas other followed them prey and ate them. With how good she smelted Suga that he would show his true nature any minute and eat her but he didn\u2019t.</p><p>He walked her all the way home. </p><p>\u201cUm\u2026This is\u2026 thank you for walking me home \u201c</p><p>\u201cno problem\u201d he was holding back his hunger</p><p>\u201cUm \u2026I was thinking\u2026um\u201d</p><p>\u201cwhat are you doing tomorrow?\u201d his hunger was getting worse but his feet were planted in that one spot and his mouth was moving on its own.</p><p>\u201cI have plans that night but I\u2019m free most of the day\u201d</p><p>\u201ccan I take you out to lunch?\u201d Jesus christ he had no clue what he was doing anymore he was just doing it</p><p>\u201cyes I\u2019d - I\u2019d like that very much\u201d</p><p>\u201cmeet at the coffee shop on the corner at 12\u2033 As he walked away he slipped a paper with his number in her hand. when the hell did he write it down. He was breaking all the rules getting himself into some deep shit that he honestly shouldn\u2019t have been messing with in the first place. </p><p>On his way home Suga stopped and masked himself for a hunt he got two kills. He found them in a back alley cornering some poor young girl no older than 15. He heard the cruel descriptions they gave the girl promising to rape and killer her. He knocked the two guys out and told the girl to run home when he was sure she was gone for good is when he actually killed and ate them. He packed the leftovers. It wasn\u2019t until he got home that he realized what he had done he saved the girl any other time he would have killed her but tonight he saved some strange girl.</p><p>What was happening to him?</p><p>This girl was changing him.</p><p>-</p><p>\u201cwhat am I doing?\u201d Suga whispered shouted at himself as he sat on the bench watching out for (y/n) they texted all night and now they were meeting up for some lunch. Suga knew he was stepping way out of line and putting both of them at risk but he couldn\u2019t stop himself he just had to have her and not in the ghoul way the human way.</p><p>\u201cHi\u201d (y/n) said snapping him out of his thoughts he stood to greet her all bad thoughts gone it was just her now.</p><p>-</p><p>He was in a trance he was just mesmerized by her\u2026everything, literally. He leaned for on his hands as she talked about random stuff his food half touched if she asked he\u2019d say he wasn\u2019t that hungry or she was more interesting. Lunch was great afterward they went for a walk in the park she was still talking and he was still listening.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I\u2019ve been rambling I talk too much. I\u2019m so sorry\u201d </p><p>\u201cit\u2019s okay\u201d he laughed \u201c It\u2019s okay I enjoy listening to you talking I like learning about you. I could listen to you all day\u201d</p><p>She blushed \u201c well you basically know everything about me. What about you tell me something interesting\u201d. And he did he was careful enough not to mention everything about him being a ghoul or having ghoul connections but he did tell her about him overall. About his passion for music and dancing about his friends who he considered brothers and the business, they ran together. He talked about his blood family who unfortunately was no longer around they were killed by CCG, he told her they were killed and nothing more. He told her almost everything and she listens.</p><p>(y/n) did listen she listen so well she noticed how sometimes he retracted his statement, pause, or suddenly changed the topic. She knew that some of the things he was say were exaggerated or had more details but she didn\u2019t question or push him he would tell when he was ready.</p><p>By the time they made it back to her apartment they practically knew everything about each other. The sun was setting and they felt like they were longtime friends or more.</p><p>\u201cI had fun today\u201d (y/n) said fidgeting with her keys </p><p>\u201cMaybe we could do it again\u201d Suga and he stepped closer to her \u201cwhen are you free again\u201d</p><p>\u201ctomorrow and any night next week\u201d she looked at his lips they were so kissable.</p><p>\u201cThen I guess I\u2019ll be taking you out every night next week\u201d he looked at her lips he just had to have them. Not even asking, he didn\u2019t have the patients for an answer, he took her lips in a kiss (y/n) instantly wrapped her arms around him and pulled him closer he wrapped his arms around her waist.</p><p>She tasted so good he imagined what she would taste like and this was ten times better. He didn\u2019t want to let up he wanted all of her. This was something he never felt before with someone he never expected to feel it with. It was like a breath of fresh air for the first time since meeting her his heart was clam he was relaxed and okay with what he was doing. It was just perfected.</p><p>(y/n) moaned as her head hit her apartment door. She hadn\u2019t been in a relationship for a few years and even then she had never kissed anybody like this before she had never felt like this with anybody before. Everything was new but she liked it. Suga was different new and she liked him.</p><p>\u201cWell damn\u201d they pulled apart to see Lori (y/n)\u2019s horrible co-worker, yes she informed Suga of her. \u201cThis is why you tried to blow me off. Hot diggity damn all is forgiven.\u201d</p><p>Suga and (y/n) expression was very unamused.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Lori. (y/n)\u2019s friend from work\u201d Lori held out her hand and gave a very seducing smile and pushing up her breast a bit trying to get his attention. (y/n) really wanted to smack some scene into her telling her they weren\u2019t friends and she needed to go but she was too sweet to do so.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Suga\u201d he didn\u2019t he even look at her hand. Honestly, these were the time of easy woman Suga sank his teeth into they were so easy to get.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\u2026 I\u2019m (y/n)\u2019s boyfriend\u201d he didn\u2019t know what lead him to say that but he did he looked at (y/n) for any protest or disgust, had he gone too far they were just kissing, but he found none she was just smiling and blushing looking down at their laced fingers.</p><p>\u201cMy boyfriend\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh really, how long as this been going on?\u201d Lori asked suspiciously </p><p>\u201clong enough,\u201d Suga said. He turned to (y/n) cupping her face and giving her a peck on the lips. \u201c I come back for you tomorrow. Enjoy your dinner with your Uncle\u201d.</p><p>Suga waited until (y/n) was safely in her apartment to leave. As he left her apartment building he could still hear Lori bagging on (y/n)\u2019s door. He took a picture of her and sent it to his brother V she\u2019d be dead by the end of next week.</p><p>Man, Suga was trying to like breaking the rule.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><hr><h2>Request tags and/or stories up to anything<strike> (within reason)</strike></h2><p><b>permanent tags</b></p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m0KE-PfiyKEnj8gdJC8CZ3g\">@lovely-lollipops-blog</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mDIHXsiwqOsA4KJnAuoywyA\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mDIHXsiwqOsA4KJnAuoywyA\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mDIHXsiwqOsA4KJnAuoywyA\">@totallyweirdsam</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m1O6PvtvFUaAwZR_iddXh8w\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m1O6PvtvFUaAwZR_iddXh8w\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m1O6PvtvFUaAwZR_iddXh8w\">@sexysamsungl</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mkyK0Jnq22rmHqHt-jHZo_A\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mkyK0Jnq22rmHqHt-jHZo_A\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mkyK0Jnq22rmHqHt-jHZo_A\">@lilylovelyxo</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfJ5wdgylCm4q3jyeBPb8cg\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfJ5wdgylCm4q3jyeBPb8cg\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfJ5wdgylCm4q3jyeBPb8cg\">@iamwarrenspeace</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrwMU-N1eyWBqA1K5ic9qWQ\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrwMU-N1eyWBqA1K5ic9qWQ\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrwMU-N1eyWBqA1K5ic9qWQ\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrwMU-N1eyWBqA1K5ic9qWQ\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrwMU-N1eyWBqA1K5ic9qWQ\">@geeksareunique</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mzajidgNJQIVOZvIzFPECiw\">@that-random-emu</a> <strike>@supreme-leader-jazlo-ren</strike> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYp8pGzF4pBII8oS8anN9_A\">@stone2576</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m9adGWBt3jMGa0aLtsEZOsw\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m9adGWBt3jMGa0aLtsEZOsw\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m9adGWBt3jMGa0aLtsEZOsw\">@lil-dino-trash</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mDDfSP29VhliVU--5ZTi9Og\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mDDfSP29VhliVU--5ZTi9Og\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mDDfSP29VhliVU--5ZTi9Og\">@metal-armed-dino</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mLqDqq50G89LOMchKwY7bTw\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mLqDqq50G89LOMchKwY7bTw\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mLqDqq50G89LOMchKwY7bTw\">@dylanobrienmoviekid</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mevyaZrgR8GtBkdROGoPYAw\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mevyaZrgR8GtBkdROGoPYAw\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mevyaZrgR8GtBkdROGoPYAw\">@theshortegg</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m0T9-sijt6TGnAND-_ni2wA\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m0T9-sijt6TGnAND-_ni2wA\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m0T9-sijt6TGnAND-_ni2wA\">@dontevenblink-badwolf-tardis</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/msMMjrkBAYPWvSqoXmZTzbw\">@mandylove1000</a>\u00a0 <strike>@isnotashtonstan </strike><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mx9FnrjZyI4lP4VUlgOzJHQ\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mx9FnrjZyI4lP4VUlgOzJHQ\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mx9FnrjZyI4lP4VUlgOzJHQ\">@broitsmydick</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mG9WcKvRlNkkS5eAeoKXlhg\">@onceaballeralwaysaballer1213</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mwvgKcJQ1BnkS7DQBhDEqag\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mwvgKcJQ1BnkS7DQBhDEqag\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mwvgKcJQ1BnkS7DQBhDEqag\">@mypage-myfandoms</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mbzvadFMc_goTWINhRBruvw\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mbzvadFMc_goTWINhRBruvw\">@jordynhartley2001</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m5UHoCdiFhHs8K5SSWknWRw\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m5UHoCdiFhHs8K5SSWknWRw\">@midnightdream83</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mChCVQGM7q310lcogWm0D0w\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mChCVQGM7q310lcogWm0D0w\">@cookies186</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mLqDqq50G89LOMchKwY7bTw\">@i-am-marvel-trash-forever</a></p></p>",

He instantly knew something was wrong when she walked out of her office not humming or singing her usual tone. She was slumped not looking up admiring the lights and the people like she usually did. Something was wrong and Suga automatically knew. So was upset and distracted which was very dangerous because I distracted (y/n) never paid attention.</p><p>Doing his usual routine Suga followed (y/n) from rooftops and across the street everything was fine going neither of them having to look where they\u2019re going to use to this walk home.

Is there something wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m doing fine thank you. I\u2019m sorry I don\u2019t feel comfortable telling strangers by problems. Even if you did say me.

For some reason (y/n) felt completely comfortable with this stranger and told him everything without holding anything back.</p><p>Suga was listening to her every word but on the inside, he was beating himself up. He was not supposed to interact with her he wasn\u2019t supposed to mean or touch her but here he was walking her home. This was something ghouls did not do he was going to take her home and make sure she was safe whereas other followed them prey and ate them. With how good she smelted Suga that he would show his true nature any minute and eat her but he didn\u2019t.</p><p>He walked her all the way home. </p><p>\u201cUm\u2026This is\u2026 thank you for walking me home \u201c</p><p>\u201cno problem\u201d he was holding back his hunger</p><p>\u201cUm \u2026I was thinking\u2026um\u201d</p><p>\u201cwhat are you doing tomorrow?\u201d his hunger was getting worse but his feet were planted in that one spot and his mouth was moving on its own.</p><p>\u201cI have plans that night but I\u2019m free most of the day\u201d</p><p>\u201ccan I take you out to lunch?\u201d Jesus christ he had no clue what he was doing anymore he was just doing it</p><p>\u201cyes I\u2019d - I\u2019d like that very much\u201d</p><p>\u201cmeet at the coffee shop on the corner at 12\u2033 As he walked away he slipped a paper with his number in her hand. when the hell did he write it down. He was breaking all the rules getting himself into some deep shit that he honestly shouldn\u2019t have been messing with in the first place. </p><p>On his way home Suga stopped and masked himself for a hunt he got two kills. He found them in a back alley cornering some poor young girl no older than 15. He heard the cruel descriptions they gave the girl promising to rape and killer her. He knocked the two guys out and told the girl to run home when he was sure she was gone for good is when he actually killed and ate them. He packed the leftovers. It wasn\u2019t until he got home that he realized what he had done he saved the girl any other time he would have killed her but tonight he saved some strange girl.</p><p>What was happening to him?</p><p>This girl was changing him.</p><p>-</p><p>\u201cwhat am I doing?\u201d Suga whispered shouted at himself as he sat on the bench watching out for (y/n) they texted all night and now they were meeting up for some lunch. Suga knew he was stepping way out of line and putting both of them at risk but he couldn\u2019t stop himself he just had to have her and not in the ghoul way the human way.</p><p>\u201cHi\u201d (y/n) said snapping him out of his thoughts he stood to greet her all bad thoughts gone it was just her now.</p><p>-</p><p>He was in a trance he was just mesmerized by her\u2026everything, literally. He leaned for on his hands as she talked about random stuff his food half touched if she asked he\u2019d say he wasn\u2019t that hungry or she was more interesting. Lunch was great afterward they went for a walk in the park she was still talking and he was still listening.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I\u2019ve been rambling I talk too much. I\u2019m so sorry\u201d </p><p>\u201cit\u2019s okay\u201d he laughed \u201c It\u2019s okay I enjoy listening to you talking I like learning about you. I could listen to you all day\u201d</p><p>She blushed \u201c well you basically know everything about me. What about you tell me something interesting\u201d. And he did he was careful enough not to mention everything about him being a ghoul or having ghoul connections but he did tell her about him overall. About his passion for music and dancing about his friends who he considered brothers and the business, they ran together. He talked about his blood family who unfortunately was no longer around they were killed by CCG, he told her they were killed and nothing more. He told her almost everything and she listens.</p><p>(y/n) did listen she listen so well she noticed how sometimes he retracted his statement, pause, or suddenly changed the topic. She knew that some of the things he was say were exaggerated or had more details but she didn\u2019t question or push him he would tell when he was ready.</p><p>By the time they made it back to her apartment they practically knew everything about each other. The sun was setting and they felt like they were longtime friends or more.</p><p>\u201cI had fun today\u201d (y/n) said fidgeting with her keys </p><p>\u201cMaybe we could do it again\u201d Suga and he stepped closer to her \u201cwhen are you free again\u201d</p><p>\u201ctomorrow and any night next week\u201d she looked at his lips they were so kissable.</p><p>\u201cThen I guess I\u2019ll be taking you out every night next week\u201d he looked at her lips he just had to have them. Not even asking, he didn\u2019t have the patients for an answer, he took her lips in a kiss (y/n) instantly wrapped her arms around him and pulled him closer he wrapped his arms around her waist.</p><p>She tasted so good he imagined what she would taste like and this was ten times better. He didn\u2019t want to let up he wanted all of her. This was something he never felt before with someone he never expected to feel it with. It was like a breath of fresh air for the first time since meeting her his heart was clam he was relaxed and okay with what he was doing. It was just perfected.</p><p>(y/n) moaned as her head hit her apartment door. She hadn\u2019t been in a relationship for a few years and even then she had never kissed anybody like this before she had never felt like this with anybody before. Everything was new but she liked it. Suga was different new and she liked him.</p><p>\u201cWell damn\u201d they pulled apart to see Lori (y/n)\u2019s horrible co-worker, yes she informed Suga of her. \u201cThis is why you tried to blow me off. Hot diggity damn all is forgiven.\u201d</p><p>Suga and (y/n) expression was very unamused.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Lori. (y/n)\u2019s friend from work\u201d Lori held out her hand and gave a very seducing smile and pushing up her breast a bit trying to get his attention. (y/n) really wanted to smack some scene into her telling her they weren\u2019t friends and she needed to go but she was too sweet to do so.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Suga\u201d he didn\u2019t he even look at her hand. Honestly, these were the time of easy woman Suga sank his teeth into they were so easy to get.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\u2026 I\u2019m (y/n)\u2019s boyfriend\u201d he didn\u2019t know what lead him to say that but he did he looked at (y/n) for any protest or disgust, had he gone too far they were just kissing, but he found none she was just smiling and blushing looking down at their laced fingers.</p><p>\u201cMy boyfriend\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh really, how long as this been going on?\u201d Lori asked suspiciously </p><p>\u201clong enough,\u201d Suga said. He turned to (y/n) cupping her face and giving her a peck on the lips. \u201c I come back for you tomorrow. Enjoy your dinner with your Uncle\u201d.</p><p>Suga waited until (y/n) was safely in her apartment to leave. As he left her apartment building he could still hear Lori bagging on (y/n)\u2019s door. He took a picture of her and sent it to his brother V she\u2019d be dead by the end of next week.</p><p>Man, Suga was trying to like breaking the rule.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><hr><h2>Request tags and/or stories up to anything<strike> (within reason)</strike></h2><p><b>permanent tags</b></p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m0KE-PfiyKEnj8gdJC8CZ3g\">@lovely-lollipops-blog</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mDIHXsiwqOsA4KJnAuoywyA\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mDIHXsiwqOsA4KJnAuoywyA\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mDIHXsiwqOsA4KJnAuoywyA\">@totallyweirdsam</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m1O6PvtvFUaAwZR_iddXh8w\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m1O6PvtvFUaAwZR_iddXh8w\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m1O6PvtvFUaAwZR_iddXh8w\">@sexysamsungl</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mkyK0Jnq22rmHqHt-jHZo_A\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mkyK0Jnq22rmHqHt-jHZo_A\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mkyK0Jnq22rmHqHt-jHZo_A\">@lilylovelyxo</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfJ5wdgylCm4q3jyeBPb8cg\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfJ5wdgylCm4q3jyeBPb8cg\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfJ5wdgylCm4q3jyeBPb8cg\">@iamwarrenspeace</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrwMU-N1eyWBqA1K5ic9qWQ\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrwMU-N1eyWBqA1K5ic9qWQ\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrwMU-N1eyWBqA1K5ic9qWQ\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrwMU-N1eyWBqA1K5ic9qWQ\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrwMU-N1eyWBqA1K5ic9qWQ\">@geeksareunique</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mzajidgNJQIVOZvIzFPECiw\">@that-random-emu</a> <strike>@supreme-leader-jazlo-ren</strike> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYp8pGzF4pBII8oS8anN9_A\">@stone2576</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m9adGWBt3jMGa0aLtsEZOsw\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m9adGWBt3jMGa0aLtsEZOsw\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m9adGWBt3jMGa0aLtsEZOsw\">@lil-dino-trash</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mDDfSP29VhliVU--5ZTi9Og\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mDDfSP29VhliVU--5ZTi9Og\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mDDfSP29VhliVU--5ZTi9Og\">@metal-armed-dino</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mLqDqq50G89LOMchKwY7bTw\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mLqDqq50G89LOMchKwY7bTw\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mLqDqq50G89LOMchKwY7bTw\">@dylanobrienmoviekid</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mevyaZrgR8GtBkdROGoPYAw\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mevyaZrgR8GtBkdROGoPYAw\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mevyaZrgR8GtBkdROGoPYAw\">@theshortegg</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m0T9-sijt6TGnAND-_ni2wA\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m0T9-sijt6TGnAND-_ni2wA\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m0T9-sijt6TGnAND-_ni2wA\">@dontevenblink-badwolf-tardis</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/msMMjrkBAYPWvSqoXmZTzbw\">@mandylove1000</a>\u00a0 <strike>@isnotashtonstan </strike><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mx9FnrjZyI4lP4VUlgOzJHQ\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mx9FnrjZyI4lP4VUlgOzJHQ\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mx9FnrjZyI4lP4VUlgOzJHQ\">@broitsmydick</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mG9WcKvRlNkkS5eAeoKXlhg\">@onceaballeralwaysaballer1213</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mwvgKcJQ1BnkS7DQBhDEqag\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mwvgKcJQ1BnkS7DQBhDEqag\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mwvgKcJQ1BnkS7DQBhDEqag\">@mypage-myfandoms</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mbzvadFMc_goTWINhRBruvw\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mbzvadFMc_goTWINhRBruvw\">@jordynhartley2001</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m5UHoCdiFhHs8K5SSWknWRw\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m5UHoCdiFhHs8K5SSWknWRw\">@midnightdream83</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mChCVQGM7q310lcogWm0D0w\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mChCVQGM7q310lcogWm0D0w\">@cookies186</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mLqDqq50G89LOMchKwY7bTw\">@i-am-marvel-trash-forever</a></p></p>",

He had been watching her for weeks the first few days the plan was to follower her and eat her simple as that. But after a while, the plan flew out the window and he was just watching her. He didn&rsquo;t know why there were plenty of opportunities to eat her he just couldn&rsquo;t bring himself to do it.</p><p>Maybe it was the way she smelled it&rsquo;s what attracted her to him at first but after some time it wasn&rsquo;t as mouth-watering anymore but soothing and calming yet still addictive. Maybe it was her voice it drew him in by now he couldn&rsquo;t pull away, she hummed to work every day. Maybe it was her looks at first she looked delicious now she looked beautiful. Maybe it was her personality at first she was a dumb ditsy human girl now she was positive, caring, shy, an innocent girl.</p><p>She was no longer food but a girl, a beautiful innocent girl that had unfortunately got his attention. But then again it wasn&rsquo;t a bad thing he watched out for her and kept her out of harm&rsquo;s way at a distance. Other ghouls would try to get her he&rsquo;d put them in their place or kill them. Mugger tries to mug her they became Suga&rsquo;s dinner.</p><p>He was her guardian demon<i> ( see what I did there)</i> watching over her as she went through life. </p><p>(y/n) was well aware of the eyes that followed her every day. When she first noticed it she was scared she was terrified ended up buying a Taser and pepper spray and started talking on the phone a friend when she walked home. She took all the precautions necessary but didn&rsquo;t stop her daily routine she wasn&rsquo;t going to let a little paranoia stop the pep in her step.</p><p>After a while (y/n) got used to the mysterious figure following her it became part of her everyday routine. She would literally wait by her front door until she felt eyes on her before going to work. The eyes became somewhat relaxing and reassuring. After a while, she stopped calling her friend and left her pepper spray and Taser at home.</p><p>It all most felt like a guardian angel was watching over her.</p><p>-</p><p>&ldquo;Hello, Good morning&rdquo; (y/n) said as she took a seat at her desk getting ready for the day&rsquo;s work. </p><p>&ldquo;Good morning (y/n)&rdquo; her coworker said before dropping a load of work on her desk she was pretty sure 75% of this work was actually her seeing ass he never really worked unless the boss came through.

And he did he was careful enough not to mention everything about him being a ghoul or having ghoul connections but he did tell her about him overall. About his passion for music and dancing about his friends who he considered brothers and the business, they ran together. He talked about his blood family who unfortunately was no longer around they were killed by CCG, he told her they were killed and nothing more. He told her almost everything and she listens.</p><p>(y/n) did listen she listen so well she noticed how sometimes he retracted his statement, pause, or suddenly changed the topic. She knew that some of the things he was say were exaggerated or had more details but she didn&rsquo;t question or push him he would tell when he was ready.</p><p>By the time they made it back to her apartment they practically knew everything about each other. The sun was setting and they felt like they were longtime friends or more.</p><p>&ldquo;I had fun today&rdquo; (y/n) said fidgeting with her keys </p><p>&ldquo;Maybe we could do it again&rdquo; Suga and he stepped closer to her &ldquo;when are you free again&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;tomorrow and any night next week&rdquo; she looked at his lips they were so kissable.</p><p>&ldquo;Then I guess I&rsquo;ll be taking you out every night next week&rdquo; he looked at her lips he just had to have them. Not even asking, he didn&rsquo;t have the patients for an answer, he took her lips in a kiss (y/n) instantly wrapped her arms around him and pulled him closer he wrapped his arms around her waist.</p><p>She tasted so good he imagined what she would taste like and this was ten times better. He didn&rsquo;t want to let up he wanted all of her. This was something he never felt before with someone he never expected to feel it with. It was like a breath of fresh air for the first time since meeting her his heart was clam he was relaxed and okay with what he was doing. It was just perfected.</p><p>(y/n) moaned as her head hit her apartment door. She hadn&rsquo;t been in a relationship for a few years and even then she had never kissed anybody like this before she had never felt like this with anybody before. Everything was new but she liked it. Suga was different new and she liked him.</p><p>&ldquo;Well damn&rdquo; they pulled apart to see Lori (y/n)&rsquo;s horrible co-worker, yes she informed Suga of her. &ldquo;This is why you tried to blow me off. Hot diggity damn all is forgiven.&rdquo;</p><p>Suga and (y/n) expression was very unamused.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Lori. (y/n)&rsquo;s friend from work&rdquo; Lori held out her hand and gave a very seducing smile and pushing up her breast a bit trying to get his attention. (y/n) really wanted to smack some scene into her telling her they weren&rsquo;t friends and she needed to go but she was too sweet to do so.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Suga&rdquo; he didn&rsquo;t he even look at her hand. Honestly, these were the time of easy woman Suga sank his teeth into they were so easy to get.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m&hellip; I&rsquo;m (y/n)&rsquo;s boyfriend&rdquo; he didn&rsquo;t know what lead him to say that but he did he looked at (y/n) for any protest or disgust, had he gone too far they were just kissing, but he found none she was just smiling and blushing looking down at their laced fingers.</p><p>&ldquo;My boyfriend&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh really, how long as this been going on?&rdquo; Lori asked suspiciously </p><p>&ldquo;long enough,&rdquo; Suga said. He turned to (y/n) cupping her face and giving her a peck on the lips. &ldquo; I come back for you tomorrow. Enjoy your dinner with your Uncle&rdquo;.</p><p>Suga waited until (y/n) was safely in her apartment to leave. As he left her apartment building he could still hear Lori bagging on (y/n)&rsquo;s door. He took a picture of her and sent it to his brother V she&rsquo;d be dead by the end of next week.</p><p>Man, Suga was trying to like breaking the rule.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><hr /><h2>Request tags and/or stories up to anything<strike> (within reason)</strike></h2><p><b>permanent tags</b></p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m0KE-PfiyKEnj8gdJC8CZ3g\">@lovely-lollipops-blog</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mDIHXsiwqOsA4KJnAuoywyA\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mDIHXsiwqOsA4KJnAuoywyA\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mDIHXsiwqOsA4KJnAuoywyA\">@totallyweirdsam</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m1O6PvtvFUaAwZR_iddXh8w\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m1O6PvtvFUaAwZR_iddXh8w\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m1O6PvtvFUaAwZR_iddXh8w\">@sexysamsungl</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mkyK0Jnq22rmHqHt-jHZo_A\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mkyK0Jnq22rmHqHt-jHZo_A\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mkyK0Jnq22rmHqHt-jHZo_A\">@lilylovelyxo</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfJ5wdgylCm4q3jyeBPb8cg\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfJ5wdgylCm4q3jyeBPb8cg\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfJ5wdgylCm4q3jyeBPb8cg\">@iamwarrenspeace</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrwMU-N1eyWBqA1K5ic9qWQ\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrwMU-N1eyWBqA1K5ic9qWQ\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrwMU-N1eyWBqA1K5ic9qWQ\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrwMU-N1eyWBqA1K5ic9qWQ\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrwMU-N1eyWBqA1K5ic9qWQ\">@geeksareunique</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mzajidgNJQIVOZvIzFPECiw\">@that-random-emu</a> <strike>@supreme-leader-jazlo-ren</strike> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYp8pGzF4pBII8oS8anN9_A\">@stone2576</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m9adGWBt3jMGa0aLtsEZOsw\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m9adGWBt3jMGa0aLtsEZOsw\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m9adGWBt3jMGa0aLtsEZOsw\">@lil-dino-trash</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mDDfSP29VhliVU--5ZTi9Og\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mDDfSP29VhliVU--5ZTi9Og\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mDDfSP29VhliVU--5ZTi9Og\">@metal-armed-dino</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mLqDqq50G89LOMchKwY7bTw\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mLqDqq50G89LOMchKwY7bTw\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mLqDqq50G89LOMchKwY7bTw\">@dylanobrienmoviekid</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mevyaZrgR8GtBkdROGoPYAw\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mevyaZrgR8GtBkdROGoPYAw\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mevyaZrgR8GtBkdROGoPYAw\">@theshortegg</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m0T9-sijt6TGnAND-_ni2wA\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m0T9-sijt6TGnAND-_ni2wA\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m0T9-sijt6TGnAND-_ni2wA\">@dontevenblink-badwolf-tardis</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/msMMjrkBAYPWvSqoXmZTzbw\">@mandylove1000</a>&nbsp; <strike>@isnotashtonstan </strike><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mx9FnrjZyI4lP4VUlgOzJHQ\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mx9FnrjZyI4lP4VUlgOzJHQ\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mx9FnrjZyI4lP4VUlgOzJHQ\">@broitsmydick</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mG9WcKvRlNkkS5eAeoKXlhg\">@onceaballeralwaysaballer1213</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mwvgKcJQ1BnkS7DQBhDEqag\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mwvgKcJQ1BnkS7DQBhDEqag\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mwvgKcJQ1BnkS7DQBhDEqag\">@mypage-myfandoms</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mbzvadFMc_goTWINhRBruvw\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mbzvadFMc_goTWINhRBruvw\">@jordynhartley2001</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m5UHoCdiFhHs8K5SSWknWRw\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m5UHoCdiFhHs8K5SSWknWRw\">@midnightdream83</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mChCVQGM7q310lcogWm0D0w\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mChCVQGM7q310lcogWm0D0w\">@cookies186</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mLqDqq50G89LOMchKwY7bTw\">@i-am-marvel-trash-forever</a></p></p>",

He had been watching her for weeks the first few days the plan was to follower her and eat her simple as that. But after a while, the plan flew out the window and he was just watching her. He didn&rsquo;t know why there were plenty of opportunities to eat her he just couldn&rsquo;t bring himself to do it.</p>\n<p>Maybe it was the way she smelled it&rsquo;s what attracted her to him at first but after some time it wasn&rsquo;t as mouth-watering anymore but soothing and calming yet still addictive. Maybe it was her voice it drew him in by now he couldn&rsquo;t pull away, she hummed to work every day. Maybe it was her looks at first she looked delicious now she looked beautiful. Maybe it was her personality at first she was a dumb ditsy human girl now she was positive, caring, shy, an innocent girl.</p>\n<p>She was no longer food but a girl, a beautiful innocent girl that had unfortunately got his attention. But then again it wasn&rsquo;t a bad thing he watched out for her and kept her out of harm&rsquo;s way at a distance. Other ghouls would try to get her he&rsquo;d put them in their place or kill them. Mugger tries to mug her they became Suga&rsquo;s dinner.</p>\n<p>He was her guardian demon<i> ( see what I did there)</i> watching over her as she went through life. </p>\n</p>",
