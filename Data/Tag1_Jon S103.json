His hair was dripping and drops of water rolled down his skin. \u201cBut I really had to get my book back to the library.\u201d</p><p>Sansa widened her eyes and dropped her jaw while she crossed her arms over her chest. \u201cA book? You\u2019re risking your life over a library fine?\u201d She rolled her eyes and then she opened the door to the bathroom to get Jon a large and clean towel. \u201cThe wind could have blown who knows what in your face or on top of you! They\u2019d really understand if you\u2019d be bringing in this book a few days late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought the weather forecast was exaggerating.\u201d Jon shrugged and took the towel from her. He buried his face in the soft fabric and dried himself as much as possible. \u201cCan I borrow your dryer for a minute?\u201d He didn\u2019t even wait for her answer and pulled his shirt over his head. </p><p>Sansa knew it was impolite to stare, but she had to stare anyway. Her eyes followed the sharp lines of his muscles and she fought the urge to place her hand on his naked chest to touch his gleaming skin. \u201cYes, sure, of course\u2026\u201d She stuttered and she swallowed when Jon took off his jeans too. </p><p>He was standing in her hallway wearing nothing but a black boxer short and instead of taking his wet clothes from him and putting them in the dryer, Sansa just stood there, unable to move. </p><p>She was not sure why she was speechless and why she stood frozen to the floor. She knew Jon ever since she had been a little girl. And just like every little girl she had had a small crush on her big brother\u2019s best friend. But she had thought that that crush had subsided, that her heart had calmed down, that Jon was nothing but an amazing friend. It seemed she had been hopelessly wrong.</p><p>\u201cSansa?\u201d Jon walked a little closer towards her and he pressed the palms of his hands to her cheeks. \u201cAre you alright?\u201d He cocked his head and Sansa swallowed.

Touching his muscles was even better than looking at them.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want to happen?\u201d Jon spoke softly and his lips were now almost touching hers. </p><p>She smiled. \u201cI want you to kiss me.\u201d When her glance met his she saw a spark there, a small spark that had never been there before. \u201cAnd more.\u201d She let his shoulder go and placed her flat hand on his bare chest. \u201cBecause I don\u2019t think I can get over you a second time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA second time?\u201d Jon\u2019s nose brushed hers and her cheeks started glowing.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me you didn\u2019t know.\u201d Sansa\u2019s arms circled around his neck and somehow she was afraid that at some point Jon would step back. </p><p>But he didn\u2019t. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s impossible that you\u2019ve never noticed my crush on you and all the pathetic excuses I came up with to talk to you and get your attention.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI always thought\u2026\u201d Jon took a deep breath. \u201cIt was simply because you hadn\u2019t really met any other guys yet.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI have now.\u201d Sansa closed the remaining distance between them and pressed her soft lips on his.

The mug stood next to the newest novel she had bought a few days ago, even though she had promised her mother to read all the books she already owned first.</p><p>The rain ticking against the window was nothing but background music.

He had his arms wrapped around him, but his teeth were clattering and his entire body shook visibly. \u201cThank goodness you\u2019re home.\u201d He let out a relieved sigh. \u201cI wasn\u2019t really looking forward to walking another three miles like this.\u201d</p><p>Sansa thought about her book, waiting for her to be read, but then she opened the front door a little wider so Jon could step inside. \u201cWhat were you even doing out there? They\u2019ve warned countless of times that a huge storm was coming and that we shouldn\u2019t leave our homes, unless in the case of an emergency.\u201d</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cI know.\u201d Jon nodded. On the floor around him a small puddle was forming. His hair was dripping and drops of water rolled down his skin. \u201cBut I really had to get my book back to the library.\u201d</p><p>Sansa widened her eyes and dropped her jaw while she crossed her arms over her chest. \u201cA book? You\u2019re risking your life over a library fine?\u201d She rolled her eyes and then she opened the door to the bathroom to get Jon a large and clean towel. \u201cThe wind could have blown who knows what in your face or on top of you! They\u2019d really understand if you\u2019d be bringing in this book a few days late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought the weather forecast was exaggerating.\u201d Jon shrugged and took the towel from her. He buried his face in the soft fabric and dried himself as much as possible. \u201cCan I borrow your dryer for a minute?\u201d He didn\u2019t even wait for her answer and pulled his shirt over his head. </p><p>Sansa knew it was impolite to stare, but she had to stare anyway. Her eyes followed the sharp lines of his muscles and she fought the urge to place her hand on his naked chest to touch his gleaming skin. \u201cYes, sure, of course\u2026\u201d She stuttered and she swallowed when Jon took off his jeans too. </p><p>He was standing in her hallway wearing nothing but a black boxer short and instead of taking his wet clothes from him and putting them in the dryer, Sansa just stood there, unable to move. </p><p>She was not sure why she was speechless and why she stood frozen to the floor. She knew Jon ever since she had been a little girl. And just like every little girl she had had a small crush on her big brother\u2019s best friend. But she had thought that that crush had subsided, that her heart had calmed down, that Jon was nothing but an amazing friend. It seemed she had been hopelessly wrong.</p><p>\u201cSansa?\u201d Jon walked a little closer towards her and he pressed the palms of his hands to her cheeks. \u201cAre you alright?\u201d He cocked his head and Sansa swallowed. He was not making things better now. Actually, he was mostly making things worse.</p><p>Her heart was now racing in her chest and she felt the adrenaline rushing through her veins. Every cell in her body and every sensitive part of her skin was reacting. \u201cYes, yes\u2026\u201d She tripped over her words once more and she wished for a hole in the ground that would swallow her. \u201cIt\u2019s just\u2026\u201d She let her eyes wander of his body once more and she stuck the tip of her tongue between her slightly parted lips. \u201cYou\u2019ve surprised me a little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI surprised you?\u201d Jon raised his eyebrows, but a smirk appeared on his face. \u201cIn a good or in a bad way?\u201d He kept his hands firmly on her cheeks and he leaned in slightly so Sansa could feel his warm breath on her nose. </p><p>She swallowed. \u201cThat depends on what will happen next.\u201d Her voice was nothing but a soft whisper and a little reluctantly she placed her hands on his shoulders. Touching his muscles was even better than looking at them.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want to happen?\u201d Jon spoke softly and his lips were now almost touching hers. </p><p>She smiled. \u201cI want you to kiss me.\u201d When her glance met his she saw a spark there, a small spark that had never been there before. \u201cAnd more.\u201d She let his shoulder go and placed her flat hand on his bare chest. \u201cBecause I don\u2019t think I can get over you a second time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA second time?\u201d Jon\u2019s nose brushed hers and her cheeks started glowing.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me you didn\u2019t know.\u201d Sansa\u2019s arms circled around his neck and somehow she was afraid that at some point Jon would step back. </p><p>But he didn\u2019t. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s impossible that you\u2019ve never noticed my crush on you and all the pathetic excuses I came up with to talk to you and get your attention.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI always thought\u2026\u201d Jon took a deep breath. \u201cIt was simply because you hadn\u2019t really met any other guys yet.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI have now.\u201d Sansa closed the remaining distance between them and pressed her soft lips on his. She couldn\u2019t believe she was really doing this. She couldn\u2019t believe she was kissing Jon Snow. And she most of all couldn\u2019t believe he was not pulling back. \u201cAnd they can\u2019t compete with you.\u201d She kissed him more firmly now and she buried her hands in his still wet curls. </p><p>When Jon kissed her back the wet clothes in need of a dryer were forgotten. Just like time and the raging storm.</p>",

        "question": "Your post about GRRM and Tolkien was so so sooo true. Like, don't get me wrong, I love AS0IAF almost as much as I love Tolkien's legendarium, and this comes from someone who never found the feelings that L0TR/Silm had given me in other fantasy series. AS0IAF managed to do that, its characters became almost as familiar as Tolkien's. But sometimes it irks me how Martin is praised for grimdark fantasy (TM) like nothing that he wrote hadn't been done by Tolkien before. Kinslaying and kingslaying?(1)",

A crazed king (Pharazon) and his cunning *Hand of the King* I mean advisor (Sauron)? The Targaryens are basically Isildur and his sons, the only royals who escape the Doom of N\u00famenor/Valyria and later found a kingdom on the continent nearby. Jon Snow is written as a younger and more inexperienced Aragorn. He even looks like Aragorn in the books </i><i>(Dark-brown hair, grey eyes). Melisandre, with her new cult and her influence over a king is Sauron\u2019s female persona. And incest? Detailed scenes of torture and death?Tolkien already did that.
