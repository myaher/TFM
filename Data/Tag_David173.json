        "body": "<p>My first review of Doctor who. Well, let\u2019s get started!<br/></p><!-- more --><p>Series 11 is the first series to star a female as The Doctor. Many fans outraged by this. Why? I don\u2019t know. Seems like they\u2019re still living in the 60s even though some are my age or a little older. I personally liked the change. I\u2019ve never seen Jodie Whittaker before this (Honestly never seen any actors before DW except for David Tennant when he played Bardy Crouch Jr.) Along with a new lead role, the writer was also changed from Steven Moffat to Chris Chibnall. First, let\u2019s start with Jodie\u2019s performance. I think Jodie was a great choice for a first female Doctor. She witty, funny and still feels like The Doctor. Her new TARDIS Exterior is alright. I like the greenish look of the wood and the blueish lamp on the top. The removal of the St. John\u2019s badge was interesting. Reminds me of the classic Series. Speaking of the classic series, the intro. I love this intro because it\u2019s a modern recreation of the old intros from Hartnell to early Pertwee. The mirrored \u201cflamey\u201d look. The new interior I love so much. Reminds me of the Jim Henson movie, The Dark Crystal. It looks mystical. Almost wizardy. Is it a fit for Jodie? Hard to say. I would see this fitting for a Doctor that\u2019s more&hellip;.crafty like (again) a wizard. The Sonics new design it cool too. People say it looks like a \u201cAdult Toy\u201d. I know they\u2019ve been saying jokes like this before but it seems to have escalated since The Doctor is now a woman. I like it because it looks more alien than the others. The others (Especially the 12th Doctors) Looks like it came from the far future. This one looks like it was designed by H.R. Geiger. And the best part? She made it out of spoons. SPOONS! Granted with some alien tech from Tim Shaw but still SPOONS! Jodie\u2019s portrayal is similar to that of Tennant\u2019s mixed with some Eccleston and a hint of Smith. While her performance was good, can\u2019t say the same about Chibnall\u2019s writing. To my understanding, like Jodie, he came from writing for Broadchurch a drama/mystery show. Haven\u2019t watched it yet so can\u2019t say much about it. Chibnall hasn\u2019t written that much for a sci-fi show. He did write a few episodes for Torchwood but other than that, not so much. His writing is okay and that\u2019s the best I can say for his writing on this. The plots for episodes can be very straight forward, bland and barely any conflict. You can pretty much watch the entirety of the season in any episode order (Excluding the first and last episode. Not the new years special.) and you wouldn\u2019t know they were sister episodes. I hope that in series 12, either 1). Chibnall does better writing or 2). A new writer is introduced. I personally hope for the latter. I want Jodie to have conflict with companions with herself. I want her to do a Doctor Snap like when Tennant\u2019s Doctor told the passengers of the Space Ship Titanic or when Smith\u2019s gave the rings of Akahten speech. I want a branching story with episodes that feel like they came soon after the events of the previous. Not right after. After all, we never saw some stories that Smith\u2019s Doctor talked about. Like Jim the Fish. Overall, I give this season a 6/10. Not the best season. But not the worst.<br/></p>",

I&rsquo;ve never seen Jodie Whittaker before this (Honestly never seen any actors before DW except for David Tennant when he played Bardy Crouch Jr.) Along with a new lead role, the writer was also changed from Steven Moffat to Chris Chibnall. First, let&rsquo;s start with Jodie&rsquo;s performance. I think Jodie was a great choice for a first female Doctor. She witty, funny and still feels like The Doctor. Her new TARDIS Exterior is alright. I like the greenish look of the wood and the blueish lamp on the top. The removal of the St. John&rsquo;s badge was interesting. Reminds me of the classic Series. Speaking of the classic series, the intro. I love this intro because it&rsquo;s a modern recreation of the old intros from Hartnell to early Pertwee. The mirrored &ldquo;flamey&rdquo; look. The new interior I love so much. Reminds me of the Jim Henson movie, The Dark Crystal. It looks mystical. Almost wizardy. Is it a fit for Jodie? Hard to say. I would see this fitting for a Doctor that&rsquo;s more&hellip;.crafty like (again) a wizard. The Sonics new design it cool too. People say it looks like a &ldquo;Adult Toy&rdquo;. I know they&rsquo;ve been saying jokes like this before but it seems to have escalated since The Doctor is now a woman. I like it because it looks more alien than the others. The others (Especially the 12th Doctors) Looks like it came from the far future. This one looks like it was designed by H.R. Geiger. And the best part? She made it out of spoons. SPOONS! Granted with some alien tech from Tim Shaw but still SPOONS! Jodie&rsquo;s portrayal is similar to that of Tennant&rsquo;s mixed with some Eccleston and a hint of Smith. While her performance was good, can&rsquo;t say the same about Chibnall&rsquo;s writing. To my understanding, like Jodie, he came from writing for Broadchurch a drama/mystery show. Haven&rsquo;t watched it yet so can&rsquo;t say much about it. Chibnall hasn&rsquo;t written that much for a sci-fi show. He did write a few episodes for Torchwood but other than that, not so much. His writing is okay and that&rsquo;s the best I can say for his writing on this. The plots for episodes can be very straight forward, bland and barely any conflict. You can pretty much watch the entirety of the season in any episode order (Excluding the first and last episode. Not the new years special.) and you wouldn&rsquo;t know they were sister episodes. I hope that in series 12, either 1). Chibnall does better writing or 2). A new writer is introduced. I personally hope for the latter. I want Jodie to have conflict with companions with herself. I want her to do a Doctor Snap like when Tennant&rsquo;s Doctor told the passengers of the Space Ship Titanic or when Smith&rsquo;s gave the rings of Akahten speech. I want a branching story with episodes that feel like they came soon after the events of the previous. Not right after. After all, we never saw some stories that Smith&rsquo;s Doctor talked about. Like Jim the Fish. Overall, I give this season a 6/10. Not the best season. But not the worst.<br /></p>",

        "body": "<p>Okay, so I wanted to make a review for a while about this show (the 2005 version, I don\u2019t know anything about all those episodes that occurred since 1963, so&hellip;).</p><p>It\u2019s not gonna be a review like the other shows. I\u2019ll try to make a top of my favourite things, but I have no clue how to review that properly otherwise. So this will be rather short in comparison to what I usually do.</p><p>-<br/></p><!-- more --><p><b>Favourite episodes (and therefore villains) (Not ranked)</b></p><ul><li>1. The Day of the Doctor - 50th anniversary special</li></ul><p>It was a magnificent anniversary episode and I watched it several times without getting fed up with it. Everything about it was marvellous. The realisation as well as the story. And it gave me the ultimate pleasure of seeing two of my favourite doctors in the same scenes. <br/></p><p>Not to mention, I loved John Hurt character so much. <br/></p><ul><li>2. Flatline - Season 8 Episode 9</li></ul><p>I remember this was, sadly, the last Doctor Who episode I was entirely hooked about. The plot put me on edge, and I loved every bit of the way they did it. It was fascinating really and so well written. <br/></p><p>I was disappointed to see they couldn\u2019t do more of those lately.\u00a0 <br/></p><ul><li>3. The Angels take Manhattan - Season 7 Episode 5</li></ul><p>As much as I loved the introduction of the Weeping Angels, I always remembered this last time with Amy and Rory.The episode was so powerful, and the fact she joined him and sacrificed herself in order to be with Rory. It broke my heart.</p><p>Especially because they were some of my favourite companions for the Doctor, like ever. And frankly, the Angels were also one of the most frightening enemy of the Doctor, imo.<br/></p><ul><li>4. Dalek - Season 1 Episode 6</li></ul><p>I really loved the idea of a Dalek having feelings.So when the story unfolded, I was really amazed by all the reflection behind it. It was the only time they mentioned that possibility, I think, but it was so important, imo.<br/></p><ul><li>5. The Empty Child/The Doctor Dances - Season 1 Episode 9/10</li></ul><p>I\u2019m always fond of a creepy ambiance on Doctor Who, I don\u2019t not why. Probably because I feel they do it right everytime. I was so frightened by those children with the masks, the ambiance of it all was just perfect and scary.</p><p>And that catch phrase made it even better. \u201cAre you my mummy ?\u201d. Still got the chills just thinking about it.<br/></p><ul><li>6. The Girl in the Fireplace - Season 2 Episode 4</li></ul><p>I liked this episode, but I was mostly appreciating the device they used with the fireplace and all. And I was also very fond of the episodes where he couldn\u2019t control the timeline and went back too late. So seeing her evolve through it was really interesting.</p><p>Also, I watched it after I saw the part with Amy, and it reminded me of their first encounter, when he becomes Matt Smith.<br/></p><ul><li>7. Bad Wolf / The Parting of the Ways - Season 1 Episode 12/13</li></ul><p>The thing about Satellite 5 was that the idea of people downloading news into their brains felt creepy enough for me to like. Also, I was fascinated by the process, even though it was gross.</p><p>So when they came back to it and it transformed into that TV reality game with people \u201cdying\u201d and it ended up being the Daleks fault, I loved it. It was also a very important episode regarding Rose storyline.</p><p>Which, I have to admit, I loved, even if I wasn\u2019t fond of her character.</p><ul><li>8. World Enough and Time/The Doctor Falls - Season 10 Episode 11/12</li></ul><p>Just like the fact I loved the idea of Daleks with feelings, I couldn\u2019t help but adore the treatment they gave to Bill becoming a cyberman with feelings. My heart broke upon seeing her like that, but I was really hooked by that dynamic. <br/></p><p>And I loved Bill from the get go, so, I felt her story was even more important.<br/></p><ul><li>9. The Name of The Doctor - Season 7 Episode 13</li></ul><p>That episode is still one of my top 3 to this day. I loved Clara and her involvement in all this was perfect. Not to mention it was an important episode talking about the name we\u2019ll probably never hear about. <br/></p><p>I know I was on the verge of my seat, asking for more. (Give us a name !). And I was really intrigued by the fact that his name alone would be dangerous.</p><p>Also, I think that episode was really showing how much Clara cared for the Doctor, and since I was a big fan of Clara/Matt relationship, I was really happy about it. It was also the one which, for me, asserted perfectly her role as the \u201cimpossible girl\u201d. <br/></p><p>10. This was supposed to be a top ten, because I really wanted to get one episode I loved for Jodie\u2019s character. But that season left me without anything to grab unto, no matter how much I adore the female Doctor (and I really do).<br/></p><p>Honourable mention : The Silence (but I call them Slendermen really&hellip;) which was creepy AF, </p><p><b>Favourite doctors (Ranked this time)<br/></b></p><ul><li>1. Matt Smith</li></ul><p>Okay, like, I loved Tennant, of course. But this was my favourite doctor of all times. I don\u2019t know, I had a tremendous crush on Matt Smith and his acting, and was so sad to see him go. <br/></p><p>Not to mention, my favourite relationship ever for the show, like I said earlier, was definitely the one Clara and Matt had. I\u2019ll forever mourn this.<br/></p><ul><li>2. David Tennant</li></ul><p>It was hard to choose between him and Capaldi for the second place, but I must admit the storylines he faced were so much better. I loved his way of being and how he acted around Rose mostly. <br/></p><p>Even though I didn\u2019t care much for her, I must admit their relationship was sweet.<br/></p><ul><li>3. Peter Capaldi</li></ul><p>Funny thing. When he was announced, I never could picture him, because I knew him from being Sid\u2019s dad on Skins, and it was really different from what he had done already.</p><p>But he delivered so well, and I loved his new approach of the role. He won me over practically instantly. It impressed me, frankly.<br/></p><p>Sadly, the end of his area came. At the time, I just hoped somehow the theory I had forged from others was right and the cycle was starting again.</p><p> I would have loved to see the doctors from the beginning (even if Matt Smith and David Tennant would have been too old by the time they would have come back to them).</p><ul><li>4.  \nJodie Whittaker <br/></li></ul><p>I love her new and refreshing tone, and the fact she\u2019s so perky and all. I found her character very endearing and I know I liked her instantly. I was waiting for it because that\u2019s the first time it\u2019s a woman, and I\u2019m so glad they seemed to do it right. <br/></p><p>She\u2019s a breath of fresh air, imo. It\u2019s sad they haven\u2019t put more into the storylines though, because I really do wanna enjoy her episodes since I love her. I hope next year is better.<br/></p><ul><li>5. \nChristopher Eccleston <br/></li></ul><p>The first time I watched Doctor Who, he annoyed me to no end. I couldn\u2019t stand the character and I wanted to smack him everytime he was on screen, so I dropped it. <br/></p><p>When BF made me start all over again, I wouldn\u2019t watch the first seasons because of it. I warmed up to him ultimately, when I finally did. But it\u2019s far from my favourite Doctor. Reason why he\u2019s at the bottom of that list.<br/></p><p><b>Favourites companions (also ranked)<br/></b></p><ul><li>1. Clara Oswald - The impossible girl</li></ul><p>I adored all the things around her and her storyline. I already loved the fact that each companion had his particularity, just like the doctors. But I was even more hooked with her.</p><p>And frankly, I was salty over her ending, because I miss her so much. But somehow, I felt it was pretty well done.<br/></p><ul><li>2. Amy Pond (and Rory Williams) - The couple who waited</li></ul><p>What can I say ? They were really perfect. They only didn\u2019t make first place because of Clara, but otherwise&hellip; Oh and of course, all the storyline with River Song was amazing too. <br/></p><p>I\u2019ll forever miss them and mourn their tragic ending. <br/></p><ul><li>3. Bill Potts - The human cyberman</li></ul><p>Like I said earlier, I loved Bill. I adored her questions, the way she viewed things and her way of behaving. She was an adorable lesbian, who pointed out things others never did. Somehow, she felt like the personification of us viewers, because she asked so many things I wondered myself.\u00a0 <br/></p><p>And I also really wanted her to meet female Doctor, she would have been so amazed and turned on, ha ha. But the way they concluded her story was also beautiful.<br/></p><p>Honourable mention to Donna Noble for becoming half a time Lord. I was annoyed by her at the beginning but I warmed up to her. So when she had to forget everything in order to survive, it broke my heart. She would have been such a badass. <br/></p><p>I loved some stories with Rose and Martha, but I could never get entirely behind their characters because they annoyed me more often than not. Although I have to admit Rose and The Doctor love story was kinda cute. Especially the way they looked and smiled at each other all the time.</p><p>I think this is it. This was not much but I feel these are my biggest opinions of it. Feel free to send some asks if you\u2019re wondering about my thoughts on other points I probably forgot to talk about. I\u2019m sorry this wasn\u2019t better. Like I said, this is the only way I knew how to review this. <br/></p>",

I\u2019ll try to make a top of my favourite things, but I have no clue how to review that properly otherwise. So this will be rather short in comparison to what I usually do.</p><p>-<br></p>[[MORE]]<p><b>Favourite episodes (and therefore villains) (Not ranked)</b></p><ul><li>1. The Day of the Doctor - 50th anniversary special</li></ul><p>It was a magnificent anniversary episode and I watched it several times without getting fed up with it. Everything about it was marvellous. The realisation as well as the story. And it gave me the ultimate pleasure of seeing two of my favourite doctors in the same scenes. <br></p><p>Not to mention, I loved John Hurt character so much. <br></p><ul><li>2. Flatline - Season 8 Episode 9</li></ul><p>I remember this was, sadly, the last Doctor Who episode I was entirely hooked about. The plot put me on edge, and I loved every bit of the way they did it. It was fascinating really and so well written. <br></p><p>I was disappointed to see they couldn\u2019t do more of those lately.\u00a0 <br></p><ul><li>3. The Angels take Manhattan - Season 7 Episode 5</li></ul><p>As much as I loved the introduction of the Weeping Angels, I always remembered this last time with Amy and Rory.The episode was so powerful, and the fact she joined him and sacrificed herself in order to be with Rory. It broke my heart.</p><p>Especially because they were some of my favourite companions for the Doctor, like ever. And frankly, the Angels were also one of the most frightening enemy of the Doctor, imo.<br></p><ul><li>4. Dalek - Season 1 Episode 6</li></ul><p>I really loved the idea of a Dalek having feelings.So when the story unfolded, I was really amazed by all the reflection behind it. It was the only time they mentioned that possibility, I think, but it was so important, imo.<br></p><ul><li>5. The Empty Child/The Doctor Dances - Season 1 Episode 9/10</li></ul><p>I\u2019m always fond of a creepy ambiance on Doctor Who, I don\u2019t not why. Probably because I feel they do it right everytime. I was so frightened by those children with the masks, the ambiance of it all was just perfect and scary.</p><p>And that catch phrase made it even better. \u201cAre you my mummy ?\u201d. Still got the chills just thinking about it.<br></p><ul><li>6. The Girl in the Fireplace - Season 2 Episode 4</li></ul><p>I liked this episode, but I was mostly appreciating the device they used with the fireplace and all. And I was also very fond of the episodes where he couldn\u2019t control the timeline and went back too late. So seeing her evolve through it was really interesting.</p><p>Also, I watched it after I saw the part with Amy, and it reminded me of their first encounter, when he becomes Matt Smith.<br></p><ul><li>7. Bad Wolf / The Parting of the Ways - Season 1 Episode 12/13</li></ul><p>The thing about Satellite 5 was that the idea of people downloading news into their brains felt creepy enough for me to like. Also, I was fascinated by the process, even though it was gross.</p><p>So when they came back to it and it transformed into that TV reality game with people \u201cdying\u201d and it ended up being the Daleks fault, I loved it. It was also a very important episode regarding Rose storyline.</p><p>Which, I have to admit, I loved, even if I wasn\u2019t fond of her character.</p><ul><li>8. World Enough and Time/The Doctor Falls - Season 10 Episode 11/12</li></ul><p>Just like the fact I loved the idea of Daleks with feelings, I couldn\u2019t help but adore the treatment they gave to Bill becoming a cyberman with feelings. My heart broke upon seeing her like that, but I was really hooked by that dynamic. <br></p><p>And I loved Bill from the get go, so, I felt her story was even more important.<br></p><ul><li>9. The Name of The Doctor - Season 7 Episode 13</li></ul><p>That episode is still one of my top 3 to this day. I loved Clara and her involvement in all this was perfect. Not to mention it was an important episode talking about the name we\u2019ll probably never hear about. <br></p><p>I know I was on the verge of my seat, asking for more. (Give us a name !). And I was really intrigued by the fact that his name alone would be dangerous.</p><p>Also, I think that episode was really showing how much Clara cared for the Doctor, and since I was a big fan of Clara/Matt relationship, I was really happy about it. It was also the one which, for me, asserted perfectly her role as the \u201cimpossible girl\u201d. <br></p><p>10. This was supposed to be a top ten, because I really wanted to get one episode I loved for Jodie\u2019s character. But that season left me without anything to grab unto, no matter how much I adore the female Doctor (and I really do).<br></p><p>Honourable mention : The Silence (but I call them Slendermen really\u2026) which was creepy AF, </p><p><b>Favourite doctors (Ranked this time)<br></b></p><ul><li>1. Matt Smith</li></ul><p>Okay, like, I loved Tennant, of course. But this was my favourite doctor of all times. I don\u2019t know, I had a tremendous crush on Matt Smith and his acting, and was so sad to see him go. <br></p><p>Not to mention, my favourite relationship ever for the show, like I said earlier, was definitely the one Clara and Matt had. I\u2019ll forever mourn this.<br></p><ul><li>2. David Tennant</li></ul><p>It was hard to choose between him and Capaldi for the second place, but I must admit the storylines he faced were so much better. I loved his way of being and how he acted around Rose mostly. <br></p><p>Even though I didn\u2019t care much for her, I must admit their relationship was sweet.<br></p><ul><li>3. Peter Capaldi</li></ul><p>Funny thing. When he was announced, I never could picture him, because I knew him from being Sid\u2019s dad on Skins, and it was really different from what he had done already.</p><p>But he delivered so well, and I loved his new approach of the role. He won me over practically instantly. It impressed me, frankly.<br></p><p>Sadly, the end of his area came. At the time, I just hoped somehow the theory I had forged from others was right and the cycle was starting again.</p><p> I would have loved to see the doctors from the beginning (even if Matt Smith and David Tennant would have been too old by the time they would have come back to them).</p><ul><li>4.  \nJodie Whittaker <br></li></ul><p>I love her new and refreshing tone, and the fact she\u2019s so perky and all. I found her character very endearing and I know I liked her instantly. I was waiting for it because that\u2019s the first time it\u2019s a woman, and I\u2019m so glad they seemed to do it right. <br></p><p>She\u2019s a breath of fresh air, imo. It\u2019s sad they haven\u2019t put more into the storylines though, because I really do wanna enjoy her episodes since I love her. I hope next year is better.<br></p><ul><li>5. \nChristopher Eccleston <br></li></ul><p>The first time I watched Doctor Who, he annoyed me to no end. I couldn\u2019t stand the character and I wanted to smack him everytime he was on screen, so I dropped it. <br></p><p>When BF made me start all over again, I wouldn\u2019t watch the first seasons because of it. I warmed up to him ultimately, when I finally did. But it\u2019s far from my favourite Doctor. Reason why he\u2019s at the bottom of that list.<br></p><p><b>Favourites companions (also ranked)<br></b></p><ul><li>1. Clara Oswald - The impossible girl</li></ul><p>I adored all the things around her and her storyline. I already loved the fact that each companion had his particularity, just like the doctors. But I was even more hooked with her.</p><p>And frankly, I was salty over her ending, because I miss her so much. But somehow, I felt it was pretty well done.<br></p><ul><li>2. Amy Pond (and Rory Williams) - The couple who waited</li></ul><p>What can I say ? They were really perfect. They only didn\u2019t make first place because of Clara, but otherwise\u2026 Oh and of course, all the storyline with River Song was amazing too. <br></p><p>I\u2019ll forever miss them and mourn their tragic ending. <br></p><ul><li>3. Bill Potts - The human cyberman</li></ul><p>Like I said earlier, I loved Bill. I adored her questions, the way she viewed things and her way of behaving. She was an adorable lesbian, who pointed out things others never did. Somehow, she felt like the personification of us viewers, because she asked so many things I wondered myself.\u00a0 <br></p><p>And I also really wanted her to meet female Doctor, she would have been so amazed and turned on, ha ha. But the way they concluded her story was also beautiful.<br></p><p>Honourable mention to Donna Noble for becoming half a time Lord. I was annoyed by her at the beginning but I warmed up to her. So when she had to forget everything in order to survive, it broke my heart. She would have been such a badass. <br></p><p>I loved some stories with Rose and Martha, but I could never get entirely behind their characters because they annoyed me more often than not. Although I have to admit Rose and The Doctor love story was kinda cute. Especially the way they looked and smiled at each other all the time.</p><p>I think this is it. This was not much but I feel these are my biggest opinions of it. Feel free to send some asks if you\u2019re wondering about my thoughts on other points I probably forgot to talk about. I\u2019m sorry this wasn\u2019t better. Like I said, this is the only way I knew how to review this. <br></p>",
