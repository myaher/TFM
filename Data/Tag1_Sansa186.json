There was a time where Joffrey made his knight beat and strip her publicly all in order to hurt and humiliate, and right after Tyrion proposed her a way out, but she didn&rsquo;t let her emotions blind her in the moment, she rationally wondered of the possibility of it being a trap and flawlessly maintained the fake ideology that she was still in love and loyal to Joffrey. The sheer amount of strength for her to do that just blows me away. Later she gets almost raped, and the first thought after she escapes that situation was wondering on why these men did it and if they were hungry, she would have given them food. While somewhat naive, it showcases that her instinct isn&rsquo;t to wish pain on others and revolve her life around revenge which is something the less emotionally strong people would do, but try to understand things from their perspective. She constantly wins small battles, whether it be pointing out the irony of Joffrey complaining about princes crying when she spotted him doing the same, or when she tried to push Joffrey into the vanguard in the Battle Of The Blackwater where the fight is the thickest which would raise the chance of his death. Though she isn&rsquo;t as naive about good people winning and bad people losing that she falls into the idea that he&rsquo;ll die, and remains grounded on what to expect from this battle (Joffrey surviving). She has some cool shady owns like when she told Tyrion that she will pray for him as she will for the king, she has a sweet heartwarming friendship with Shae, she is the one to calm the women of the Blackwater when the night was the darkest and the queen ran with her tails between her legs even when these women have done nothing but ignore her, she finds solace in the doll her father gave her and and on these memories of home, and spends this season not as a victim but as a survivor, and a smart and resilient one at that.\n\n<br/></p>",
