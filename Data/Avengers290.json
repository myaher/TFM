He felt like he\u2019d inhaled\na dessert\u2019s worth of sand as he writhed and clawed at his throat, desperately\nwilling his lungs to move, to push through the excruciating pain, to <i>breathe</i>. Why would breathing be this\nhard? It should be exhilarating, and refreshing, and the oxygen rush should be\nmaking him high as a kite right now, but no, he felt fire ants in his chest and\nlead in his throat. </p><p>The second thing Peter\nnoticed was the sound. The sound of wind around him, the crunch of boots\nagainst gravel, the <i>weeping.</i> The\nmournful terrible weeping that surrounded him. <i>Shut up</i>! He wanted to yell. <i>Can\u2019t\nyou see that I can\u2019t even breath??</i> But it wasn\u2019t just one voice sobbing\naway; there were a mixture of so many different voices, sounds, and grunts.\nMuffled words and screams. Screams? And then it dawned upon Peter that the\nscreaming belonged to him. As soon as he realised that, he stopped, chest\nheaving, and cool, <i>cool</i>, glorious air\nfilled his lungs and <i>he could breathe. </i></p><p>The third thing Peter\nnoticed was that he wasn\u2019t lying down. He was sitting upright, but was unable\nto move, clamped tight against a suit of a titanium-gold alloy. Red skies,\nbroken spaceships, burnt ground and <i>people</i>.\nBeautiful, gorgeous, <i>live</i> people.\nHugging, kissing, crying together and being <i>alive.\n</i>He tried to turn his head but felt another man\u2019s head blocking him. His\nsenses slowly started to return to him, and the haziness dissipated. His lungs\nmight still have been burning from the lack of oxygen, but he could recognise\nthe scent of the man attached to him <i>miles</i>\naway. Coffee. Motor oil. Blood. Sweat. Tears.</p><p>\u201c\u2026mister Stark?\u201d he\ncroaked. Instantly the arm around him tightened and muffled sobs filled his\nears. (<i>I\u2019ve got you, I\u2019ve got you, I\u2019ve\ngot you.</i>)</p><p>\u201cWha-what happened?\u201d\nhe pat Tony gently, but the man refused to relent. </p><p>\u201cWe won,\u201d the strangled\nwhisper replied came, so small, so fragile, so <i>broken.</i> (<i>I\u2019ve got you, I\u2019ve\ngot you, I\u2019ve got you.</i>)</p><p>The fourth thing that\nPeter noticed was that Tony was only hugging him with one arm. Struggling,\n(because getting hugged tightly when you\u2019re sitting on your ass is actually <i>quite</i> uncomfortable) he took a peek\ndown. </p><p>\u201cMr Stark!\u201d He practically\nyelled. \u201cYour arm!\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s ok,\u201d Tony\nhushed, seemingly focused on higher priorities.

Peter pulled away to stare at his mentor,\nholding his shoulders and looking him in the eyes. But when he saw tears and\nthe sheer unfiltered <i>pain</i> in the eyes\nof the man he called his hero, his mentor, his heart broke and he began sobbing\nand pulled Tony into a hug again. Tony, the man who fished him out of a hole in\nQueens. Tony, the billionaire who gave him a multi-million-dollar suit and a\nfuture, with no expectations of anything in return. Tony, the human genius who had\nsingle-handedly fought off two super-soldiers with a malfunctioning suit, and the\nonly one to make Thanos bleed before the snap. The warrior who had the ferocity\nof a thousand burning suns behind his eyes, yet had the kindness to be a father\nto a single boy who never asked for it, but desperately needed it. <i>I\u2019m sorry</i>, was what Peter really wanted\nto say. <i>I\u2019m sorry that I couldn\u2019t help\nyou.

Give me more prompts!!</b></p><p><b><i>4 Things that Peter noticed when he woke up after the war.&nbsp;</i></b></p><p>The first thing Peter\nnoticed was the sinking lack of oxygen in his lungs. He felt like he&rsquo;d inhaled\na dessert&rsquo;s worth of sand as he writhed and clawed at his throat, desperately\nwilling his lungs to move, to push through the excruciating pain, to <i>breathe</i>. Why would breathing be this\nhard? It should be exhilarating, and refreshing, and the oxygen rush should be\nmaking him high as a kite right now, but no, he felt fire ants in his chest and\nlead in his throat. </p><p>The second thing Peter\nnoticed was the sound. The sound of wind around him, the crunch of boots\nagainst gravel, the <i>weeping.</i> The\nmournful terrible weeping that surrounded him. <i>Shut up</i>! He wanted to yell. <i>Can&rsquo;t\nyou see that I can&rsquo;t even breath??</i> But it wasn&rsquo;t just one voice sobbing\naway; there were a mixture of so many different voices, sounds, and grunts.\nMuffled words and screams. Screams? And then it dawned upon Peter that the\nscreaming belonged to him. As soon as he realised that, he stopped, chest\nheaving, and cool, <i>cool</i>, glorious air\nfilled his lungs and <i>he could breathe. </i></p><p>The third thing Peter\nnoticed was that he wasn&rsquo;t lying down. He was sitting upright, but was unable\nto move, clamped tight against a suit of a titanium-gold alloy. Red skies,\nbroken spaceships, burnt ground and <i>people</i>.\nBeautiful, gorgeous, <i>live</i> people.\nHugging, kissing, crying together and being <i>alive.\n</i>He tried to turn his head but felt another man&rsquo;s head blocking him. His\nsenses slowly started to return to him, and the haziness dissipated. His lungs\nmight still have been burning from the lack of oxygen, but he could recognise\nthe scent of the man attached to him <i>miles</i>\naway. Coffee. Motor oil. Blood. Sweat. Tears.</p><p>&ldquo;&hellip;mister Stark?&rdquo; he\ncroaked. Instantly the arm around him tightened and muffled sobs filled his\nears. (<i>I&rsquo;ve got you, I&rsquo;ve got you, I&rsquo;ve\ngot you.</i>)</p><p>&ldquo;Wha-what happened?&rdquo;\nhe pat Tony gently, but the man refused to relent. </p><p>&ldquo;We won,&rdquo; the strangled\nwhisper replied came, so small, so fragile, so <i>broken.</i> (<i>I&rsquo;ve got you, I&rsquo;ve\ngot you, I&rsquo;ve got you.</i>)</p><p>The fourth thing that\nPeter noticed was that Tony was only hugging him with one arm.
