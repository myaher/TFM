Especially romcoms or ones where the heroine has to overcome a huge obstacle in her way. Most of his downtime can find him with one of his favorite volumes curled up in a corner to read.\u00a0</p><p>-He has so many soft tactiles in his room that being in there is like being on a cloud. His blankets are super soft, his pillows, his clothing, his carpet. Anything he touches is on the regular is bound to be soft. Very few of his items are hard and are mostly used to keep his hands busy.\u00a0</p><p>-Fidget toys are his best friend at times.\u00a0</p><p>-Stuffed animals also tend to be his forte. Not that he actively goes to get them but his friends and family send him them often and so he\u2019s got a bunch that all have names.\u00a0</p><p>-While he doesn\u2019t label himself out of the binary of the gender spectrum, he doesn\u2019t really see much of the boundaries when he\u2019s with his friends, family, or alone. He\u2019ll enjoy stuff just because he enjoys it, not caring if it\u2019s \u201cmeant for women\u201d. Sometimes he struggles with showing any of this in public so it\u2019s mostly a secret.\u00a0</p><p>-Stained glass is a hobby of his. Loving to fill his windows with the colorful decorations and waking up to a room covered in rainbows during the sunrise.\u00a0</p><p>-He has a decent surplus of talents that lay hidden. Often picking up a new hobby or something to keep his hands/mind busy when he needs it. He\u2019s rather good at anything that can be done with idle hands.\u00a0</p><p>-Not good with vocal words but give him paper/pen or a computer and he will spin you a beautiful tale in form of written words. Mirio and Nejire absolutely love his poetry and reference him as their favorite author.\u00a0</p><p>-Mirio\u2019s terrible humor always gets him snickering/giggling. He tries to hide it the best he can but his friends saw it once and that was the end of that. He laughs openly when no one is looking.\u00a0</p><p>-Mild OCD. Constantly having to do somethings over and over again until he\u2019s satisfied with the result. Even mundane things. Sometimes he enters a room too loudly and excuses himself to do it again. He repeats words a few times under his breath until he thinks he has the tone right and says it again louder. Fatgum will at times meet him outside the agency to walk and talk with him when he struggles to make it on time. He\u2019s doing great all things considered and can be the hero he needs to be with it.\u00a0<br/>\u2013His entire class knows about this and is more than accommodating and will wait for his signal to see if he needs help to overcome his urges. If he manages to stop on his own during a bad episode he will be utterly bombarded with support.\u00a0<br/>\u2014He used to have food aversion as a child because of this but managed to overcome it\u00a0(with few regressions) with help from Mirio.</p><p>-White is his favorite color but he feels it\u2019s too bold of a color for him to wear regularly off-duty so he wears darker colors instead.\u00a0<br/><br/>-He is one of the best supportive friends you could have at times. If you\u2019re scared or nervous he\u2019s one of the people you can go to to be thoroughly reassured. Sure, sometimes he struggles to agree with you about himself but he will go to great lengths to remind you that you\u2019re amazing and can do anything if you put your mind to it.\u00a0</p><p>-He can finish a sudoku in record time.\u00a0</p><p>-Sometimes when he crashes for the night, he misses his bed and just lays on the floor. Luckily his carpet is extra soft.\u00a0</p><p>-He draws on his arms and hands. Not anything particularly astounding in terms of art but he\u2019ll have tiny stars, comets, planets, the works on them throughout the day. It\u2019s not odd to see him roll up his sleeves and reveal a tiny makeshift galaxy underneath. Occasionally he sneaks a sun onto Mirio\u2019s arm when his friend isn\u2019t paying attention.<br/>\u2013Mirio will argue tooth and nail with anyone who tells him he should wash it off. Saying it\u2019s important to him.\u00a0</p><p>-He\u2019s learning to play the piano because he finds the music very calming. He only knows\u00a0\u201cNeko Funjatta\u201d by heart right now but he\u2019s working on it.\u00a0<br/></p><p>-He\u2019s one of those people that greets animals like people and talks to them as such. If he passes by a stray cat he will bow his head in greeting and wishes them a good day. Animals find him rather relaxing to be around and will curl up beside him at times. It\u2019s not odd to leave him alone for 5 minutes and come back to him surrounded by three cats and a bird.\u00a0</p>",

He&rsquo;ll enjoy stuff just because he enjoys it, not caring if it&rsquo;s &ldquo;meant for women&rdquo;. Sometimes he struggles with showing any of this in public so it&rsquo;s mostly a secret.&nbsp;</p><p>-Stained glass is a hobby of his. Loving to fill his windows with the colorful decorations and waking up to a room covered in rainbows during the sunrise.&nbsp;</p><p>-He has a decent surplus of talents that lay hidden. Often picking up a new hobby or something to keep his hands/mind busy when he needs it. He&rsquo;s rather good at anything that can be done with idle hands.&nbsp;</p><p>-Not good with vocal words but give him paper/pen or a computer and he will spin you a beautiful tale in form of written words. Mirio and Nejire absolutely love his poetry and reference him as their favorite author.&nbsp;</p><p>-Mirio&rsquo;s terrible humor always gets him snickering/giggling. He tries to hide it the best he can but his friends saw it once and that was the end of that. He laughs openly when no one is looking.&nbsp;</p><p>-Mild OCD. Constantly having to do somethings over and over again until he&rsquo;s satisfied with the result. Even mundane things. Sometimes he enters a room too loudly and excuses himself to do it again. He repeats words a few times under his breath until he thinks he has the tone right and says it again louder. Fatgum will at times meet him outside the agency to walk and talk with him when he struggles to make it on time. He&rsquo;s doing great all things considered and can be the hero he needs to be with it.&nbsp;<br />&ndash;His entire class knows about this and is more than accommodating and will wait for his signal to see if he needs help to overcome his urges. If he manages to stop on his own during a bad episode he will be utterly bombarded with support.&nbsp;<br />&mdash;He used to have food aversion as a child because of this but managed to overcome it&nbsp;(with few regressions) with help from Mirio.</p><p>-White is his favorite color but he feels it&rsquo;s too bold of a color for him to wear regularly off-duty so he wears darker colors instead.&nbsp;<br /><br />-He is one of the best supportive friends you could have at times. If you&rsquo;re scared or nervous he&rsquo;s one of the people you can go to to be thoroughly reassured. Sure, sometimes he struggles to agree with you about himself but he will go to great lengths to remind you that you&rsquo;re amazing and can do anything if you put your mind to it.&nbsp;</p><p>-He can finish a sudoku in record time.&nbsp;</p><p>-Sometimes when he crashes for the night, he misses his bed and just lays on the floor. Luckily his carpet is extra soft.&nbsp;</p><p>-He draws on his arms and hands. Not anything particularly astounding in terms of art but he&rsquo;ll have tiny stars, comets, planets, the works on them throughout the day. It&rsquo;s not odd to see him roll up his sleeves and reveal a tiny makeshift galaxy underneath. Occasionally he sneaks a sun onto Mirio&rsquo;s arm when his friend isn&rsquo;t paying attention.<br />&ndash;Mirio will argue tooth and nail with anyone who tells him he should wash it off. Saying it&rsquo;s important to him.&nbsp;</p><p>-He&rsquo;s learning to play the piano because he finds the music very calming. He only knows&nbsp;&ldquo;Neko Funjatta&rdquo; by heart right now but he&rsquo;s working on it.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>-He&rsquo;s one of those people that greets animals like people and talks to them as such. If he passes by a stray cat he will bow his head in greeting and wishes them a good day. Animals find him rather relaxing to be around and will curl up beside him at times. It&rsquo;s not odd to leave him alone for 5 minutes and come back to him surrounded by three cats and a bird.&nbsp;</p>",
