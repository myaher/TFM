She was almost positive that she had seen darkened green eyes follow her around the room as she went about her work out routine in the gym. She was also certain that she had felt someone watching her while she lifted weights for the last fifteen minutes and her suspicions were confirmed as she bent down to pick up her towel and caught the eye of the red head on the other side of the room, daring to maintain eye contact as the other woman wet her lips before turning away. </p><p>It was impossible for Carol not to feel a little smug that her efforts hadn\u2019t gone unnoticed, slinging her towel over her shoulder before making her way out of the gym and heading for the showers. She hadn\u2019t gone to work out with the intention of flaunting herself so openly. However when she walked in and saw Natasha training alone as well, it had seemed like much too good an opportunity to miss. </p><p>Granted this was probably not the best of plans; to continue with what had been branded by both women as a \u2018terrible idea\u2019. It was messy and thoughtless and it only added another account to an already extensive list of complicated situations Carol\u2019s impulsiveness has gotten her into in the past. But stopping herself from acting in the moment had never been Carol\u2019s strong suit and with the mission at hand getting harder by the day, sources of comfort were in short supply. </p><p>A small part of her hoped that the other woman wouldn\u2019t follow her. That it would just make everything easier if the opportunity was simply taken away from her and she wouldn\u2019t have to resist alone. Throwing her work out gear onto the bench and retrieving a fresh towel from her locker, Carol wondered if it would just be for the best if Natasha ignored her this time and she was left to deal with things on her own. </p><p>Was that what she wanted though? <i>Definitely</i> not. </p><p>Her mind was plagued with memories of the times Natasha had helped her deal with the toll this mission was taking. <i>Teeth sinking into her shoulders followed by lips sucking and teasing darkened marks into her flesh. </i>Carol bunched her eyes closed and gave her head a shake before stepping onto the tiles beneath the shower head, pointlessly trying to banish the images from her brain. But still they kept coming. <i>Hardened nipples pressing into her back and a hot breath on the back of her neck as slender fingers slipped between her legs and were plunged inside of her. </i>Slamming her hand against the nozzle on the wall, Carol pushed out a long breath and looked down as the water began to fall over her. She rubbed at her eyes and then over her forehead to push the wet hair out of her face as she attempted to compose herself and just <i>think straight</i>. She was supposed to be here to help The Avengers. This was work and that meant being professional and making sure the job gets done. Natasha was a team mate and getting too personal with co workers was always destined to end badly, never mind sleeping together. </p><p>After several minutes of pep talk, Carol finally felt like she could feel her heart rate returning to normal, thoughts of naked, writhing flesh and moans of pleasure no longer consuming her mind. <i>It was a bad idea.</i></p><p>Her stomach dropped when she heard the faint sound of a footstep on the wet tiles behind her, her heart beginning to hammer again as she sensed the presence of someone close to her. </p><p>\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t.\u201d muttered Carol quietly, her statement sounding weak enough that it must have taken all of her effort just to say it.</p><p>There was no response, but she heard someone taking a few steps closer until eventually she felt the touch of someone else\u2019s skin graze lightly against her back. </p><p>\u201cHands &hellip; against the wall.\u201d </p><p>Carol huffed, leaning forward enough so that she could rest her forehead against the tiles and look down at the ground. She tried to focus on the water going down the drain in an attempt to ground herself and not succumb to what was about to happen. </p><p>\u201cNat, really &hellip; this isn\u2019t a good idea.\u201d </p><p>Her eyes fell closed as she felt soft lips press a lingering kiss to the back of her neck followed by words spoken lowly into her ear, \u201cI said hands on the wall Danvers.\u201d </p><p>Pushing out a shaky breath, Carol shook her head from side to side against the wall of the shower as she tried to ignore the burning heat of arousal that was taking over her body. She knew it was pointless, already sure she was soaked just from <i>thinking</i> about what Natasha was capable of doing to her. There was no use fighting what she was feeling, her body already acting on impulse as she raised her arms to rest her hands either side of her head on the wall. She could practically hear the smirk on Natasha\u2019s face when she spoke again, </p><p>\u201cFeet apart.\u201d </p><p>This time she didn\u2019t hesitate before doing as she was told, shuffling her feet along the ground as she pushed out a shaky breath. The feeling of Natasha\u2019s fingers sinking into her hips to hold her in place only served in making her lose the last of her resolve. </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it.\u201d said Natasha quietly, giving the inside of one of Carol\u2019s feet a gentle kick, \u201cBit further princess.\u201d </p><p>Carol swallowed thickly as she did as she was asked, another wave of arousal washing over her at Natasha\u2019s words. She could only shiver and release a low moan as fingers skimmed over the inside of her thigh and she felt the other woman\u2019s breath hit her ear. </p><p>\u201cYou still think we shouldn\u2019t?\u201d Asked Natasha, her tone taunting as she dragged her fingers a little further up Carol\u2019s leg, leaning forward enough that her breasts were pressed to the blonde\u2019s back. </p><p>Carol laughed quietly, the hairs on the back of her neck beginning to stand on end as Natasha\u2019s contact got heavier on her skin, \u201cI still think it\u2019s a bad idea.\u201d </p><p>Humming in response, Natasha pressed her lips to the side of Carol\u2019s neck, covering her skin with bites and open mouthed kisses as her hand reached the top of Carol\u2019s inner thigh and paused. </p><p>\u201cSo you think I should stop?\u201d Asked Natasha quietly, teeth scraping against Carol\u2019s shoulder as she brushed a finger lightly over the length of her pussy. </p><p>Carol could only moan in response, fingers wiggling against the tiles as she tried to stop herself from just giving in entirely and pushing down onto Natasha\u2019s hand. </p><p>\u201cI asked you a question.\u201d Natasha paused to press a kiss underneath the other woman\u2019s ear, \u201cDo you want me to stop? I was under the impression I had to follow Captain\u2019s orders.\u201d </p><p>\u201cGod I hate that you\u2019re so good at this.\u201d groaned Carol, her tone only half serious. Already she felt like she had never been more turned on in her life, sure that evidence of her arousal had to be dripping down her thighs at this point. Natasha\u2019s fingers were continuing to move slowly, occasionally dipping lower just enough to graze her clit or tease her entrance before moving back, and each touch was causing Carol\u2019s hips to move involuntarily in a bid for more.</p><p>\u201cNo you don\u2019t.\u201d Teased Natasha, finding it harder and harder to mask her own enjoyment as she felt how wet Carol was already. \u201cYou want it or not?\u201d </p><p>Blowing out a sharp breath, Carol turned her head so she could just about see the red head out the corner of her eye, \u201cYes, shit Nat just fuck me already.\u201d </p><p>The last thing Carol heard was a low chuckle from Natasha before the pulsing of blood in her ears blocked out everything as she felt the other woman push two fingers forcefully inside of her. If it hadn\u2019t been for her hands and forehead pressed against the tiles, she was positive she would have toppled over at the overwhelming sensation of pleasure that took over her as Natasha started to fuck her. The sounds of her moans already deafening as they echoed off the bathroom tiles but Carol couldn\u2019t bring herself to care as Natasha buried her fingers inside of her pussy again. </p><p>Each thrust and curl of her fingers felt incredible and Carol was struggling to think of any reason at all why she would ever have tried to fight this.  A loud groan of Natasha\u2019s name sounded through the showers as the red head slipped her other hand around Carol\u2019s waist towards her breast so that was able to pinch at one of her nipples, lips and teeth and tongue continuing their assault on the blonde\u2019s skin. </p><p>Carol\u2019s fingers scratched and scraped against the tiles in the hope of finding something, <i>anything</i> to hold onto as Natasha dipped her other hand lower so she was able to circle over her clit. She had found herself completely trapped between Natasha\u2019s body and the wall that she was near enough being pounded into, grateful for something holding her in place as her legs started to tremble beneath her. </p><p>\u201cDo you wanna come for me?\u201d Asked Natasha tauntingly, sinking her teeth into Carol\u2019s ear lobe and pressing harder against her clit as the other woman merely moaned and nodded her head eagerly. Her head was already spinning, body beginning to tingle as each push of Natasha\u2019s fingers brought her closer to the edge. She was desperately hoping Natasha would just <i>allow</i> her to come so easily, not failing to forget previous encounters when the red head would have her begging for it. But another curl of her digits as she circled over her clit again told her that this time, she wasn\u2019t going to be disappointed, \u201cCome on then pretty girl, I wanna hear how good I make you feel.\u201d </p><p>Allowing herself to be so desperately at someone\u2019s mercy was a new experience for Carol but the most bizarre thing about it all was how totally and completely she was into it. The almost mocking tone Natasha would use with her sometimes would send a shiver down her spine and it only made her moan out louder in pleasure. This, she had discovered, usually spurred the red head on more and would result in Carol getting exactly what she wanted. It seemed this time would be no different, the blonde groaning out loud in pleasure as Natasha slammed her fingers into her harder and she could feel her orgasm beginning to build in the pit of her stomach. </p><p>\u201cOh my god, <i>fuck</i>-\u201c Carol dropped one of her hands from the wall as she felt herself tightening around the firm brush of fingertips inside of her, using it instead to grip Natasha\u2019s wrist both for something to help her keep upright and to make sure there was no risk of her stopping. \u201cI\u2019m so close Nat, just a little&hellip;\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t get a chance to finish her sentence as another buck of her hips against the other woman\u2019s hand was enough to push her over the edge, Natasha\u2019s fingers angled perfectly to hit the spot that made her see stars. The red head released a low groan of satisfaction as she felt Carol\u2019s pussy clench around her, a loud moan of her name sounding throughout the shower as her body shuddered and she came hard. </p><p>Allowing her to ride out her high, Natasha didn\u2019t stop the movement of her hand completely, slowing her pace as she rested her forehead against Carol\u2019s back and used the other hand to stroke gently over her hip. </p><p>Carol was still attempting to regulate her breathing when she spoke, barely stuttering out words between pants for breath, \u201cOkay we really need to stop doing this.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou said that last time.\u201d Muttered Natasha, lazily withdrawing her fingers and unable to suppress a grin at the jerk of the hips the movement caused, \u201cAnd the time before that.\u201d </p><p>She was unable to hold back a laugh, gulping in air in a bid to catch her breath, \u201cI mean it this time.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou sure about that?\u201d Asked Natasha, raising her hand to the top of the other woman\u2019s back and pressing her index finger between her shoulder blades. Carol tilted her head from side to side, resisting the urge to squirm under the red head\u2019s touch as she dragged her finger slowly down her spine, \u201cCause I think it feels like you want me to fuck you again.\u201d </p><p>The noise that left Carol\u2019s lips was closer to a growl than anything. She so badly wanted to do the right thing, but in a post orgasmic daze and with the feeling of Natasha\u2019s fingers buried inside of her still so fresh, it was impossible to do anything but arch herself into the woman behind her. Who was to say this was so wrong anyway? </p><p>Turning on the spot, Carol grabbed Natasha\u2019s face in her hands and pulled her body flush against her own, \u201cI\u2019m being stupid right?\u201d </p><p>Natasha smirked, \u201cTotally stupid.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThought so.\u201d Carol nodded her head frantically, tugging the other woman\u2019s lips to meet her own and mumbling into her mouth, \u201cJust keep fucking me until I stop being stupid then.\u201d </p><p>Her smirk broadening, Natasha dipped her hand to plunge her fingers eagerly back inside of Carol, \u201cWhatever you say <i>Captain</i>.\u201d </p>",

She tried to focus on the water going down the drain in an attempt to ground herself and not succumb to what was about to happen. </p><p>\u201cNat, really \u2026 this isn\u2019t a good idea.\u201d </p><p>Her eyes fell closed as she felt soft lips press a lingering kiss to the back of her neck followed by words spoken lowly into her ear, \u201cI said hands on the wall Danvers.\u201d </p><p>Pushing out a shaky breath, Carol shook her head from side to side against the wall of the shower as she tried to ignore the burning heat of arousal that was taking over her body. She knew it was pointless, already sure she was soaked just from <i>thinking</i> about what Natasha was capable of doing to her. There was no use fighting what she was feeling, her body already acting on impulse as she raised her arms to rest her hands either side of her head on the wall. She could practically hear the smirk on Natasha\u2019s face when she spoke again, </p><p>\u201cFeet apart.\u201d </p><p>This time she didn\u2019t hesitate before doing as she was told, shuffling her feet along the ground as she pushed out a shaky breath. The feeling of Natasha\u2019s fingers sinking into her hips to hold her in place only served in making her lose the last of her resolve. </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it.\u201d said Natasha quietly, giving the inside of one of Carol\u2019s feet a gentle kick, \u201cBit further princess.\u201d </p><p>Carol swallowed thickly as she did as she was asked, another wave of arousal washing over her at Natasha\u2019s words. She could only shiver and release a low moan as fingers skimmed over the inside of her thigh and she felt the other woman\u2019s breath hit her ear. </p><p>\u201cYou still think we shouldn\u2019t?\u201d Asked Natasha, her tone taunting as she dragged her fingers a little further up Carol\u2019s leg, leaning forward enough that her breasts were pressed to the blonde\u2019s back. </p><p>Carol laughed quietly, the hairs on the back of her neck beginning to stand on end as Natasha\u2019s contact got heavier on her skin, \u201cI still think it\u2019s a bad idea.\u201d </p><p>Humming in response, Natasha pressed her lips to the side of Carol\u2019s neck, covering her skin with bites and open mouthed kisses as her hand reached the top of Carol\u2019s inner thigh and paused. </p><p>\u201cSo you think I should stop?\u201d Asked Natasha quietly, teeth scraping against Carol\u2019s shoulder as she brushed a finger lightly over the length of her pussy. </p><p>Carol could only moan in response, fingers wiggling against the tiles as she tried to stop herself from just giving in entirely and pushing down onto Natasha\u2019s hand. </p><p>\u201cI asked you a question.\u201d Natasha paused to press a kiss underneath the other woman\u2019s ear, \u201cDo you want me to stop? I was under the impression I had to follow Captain\u2019s orders.\u201d </p><p>\u201cGod I hate that you\u2019re so good at this.\u201d groaned Carol, her tone only half serious. Already she felt like she had never been more turned on in her life, sure that evidence of her arousal had to be dripping down her thighs at this point. Natasha\u2019s fingers were continuing to move slowly, occasionally dipping lower just enough to graze her clit or tease her entrance before moving back, and each touch was causing Carol\u2019s hips to move involuntarily in a bid for more.</p><p>\u201cNo you don\u2019t.\u201d Teased Natasha, finding it harder and harder to mask her own enjoyment as she felt how wet Carol was already. \u201cYou want it or not?\u201d </p><p>Blowing out a sharp breath, Carol turned her head so she could just about see the red head out the corner of her eye, \u201cYes, shit Nat just fuck me already.\u201d </p><p>The last thing Carol heard was a low chuckle from Natasha before the pulsing of blood in her ears blocked out everything as she felt the other woman push two fingers forcefully inside of her. If it hadn\u2019t been for her hands and forehead pressed against the tiles, she was positive she would have toppled over at the overwhelming sensation of pleasure that took over her as Natasha started to fuck her. The sounds of her moans already deafening as they echoed off the bathroom tiles but Carol couldn\u2019t bring herself to care as Natasha buried her fingers inside of her pussy again. </p><p>Each thrust and curl of her fingers felt incredible and Carol was struggling to think of any reason at all why she would ever have tried to fight this.  A loud groan of Natasha\u2019s name sounded through the showers as the red head slipped her other hand around Carol\u2019s waist towards her breast so that was able to pinch at one of her nipples, lips and teeth and tongue continuing their assault on the blonde\u2019s skin. </p><p>Carol\u2019s fingers scratched and scraped against the tiles in the hope of finding something, <i>anything</i> to hold onto as Natasha dipped her other hand lower so she was able to circle over her clit. She had found herself completely trapped between Natasha\u2019s body and the wall that she was near enough being pounded into, grateful for something holding her in place as her legs started to tremble beneath her. </p><p>\u201cDo you wanna come for me?\u201d Asked Natasha tauntingly, sinking her teeth into Carol\u2019s ear lobe and pressing harder against her clit as the other woman merely moaned and nodded her head eagerly. Her head was already spinning, body beginning to tingle as each push of Natasha\u2019s fingers brought her closer to the edge. She was desperately hoping Natasha would just <i>allow</i> her to come so easily, not failing to forget previous encounters when the red head would have her begging for it. But another curl of her digits as she circled over her clit again told her that this time, she wasn\u2019t going to be disappointed, \u201cCome on then pretty girl, I wanna hear how good I make you feel.\u201d </p><p>Allowing herself to be so desperately at someone\u2019s mercy was a new experience for Carol but the most bizarre thing about it all was how totally and completely she was into it. The almost mocking tone Natasha would use with her sometimes would send a shiver down her spine and it only made her moan out louder in pleasure. This, she had discovered, usually spurred the red head on more and would result in Carol getting exactly what she wanted. It seemed this time would be no different, the blonde groaning out loud in pleasure as Natasha slammed her fingers into her harder and she could feel her orgasm beginning to build in the pit of her stomach. </p><p>\u201cOh my god, <i>fuck</i>-\u201c Carol dropped one of her hands from the wall as she felt herself tightening around the firm brush of fingertips inside of her, using it instead to grip Natasha\u2019s wrist both for something to help her keep upright and to make sure there was no risk of her stopping. \u201cI\u2019m so close Nat, just a little\u2026\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t get a chance to finish her sentence as another buck of her hips against the other woman\u2019s hand was enough to push her over the edge, Natasha\u2019s fingers angled perfectly to hit the spot that made her see stars. The red head released a low groan of satisfaction as she felt Carol\u2019s pussy clench around her, a loud moan of her name sounding throughout the shower as her body shuddered and she came hard. </p><p>Allowing her to ride out her high, Natasha didn\u2019t stop the movement of her hand completely, slowing her pace as she rested her forehead against Carol\u2019s back and used the other hand to stroke gently over her hip. </p><p>Carol was still attempting to regulate her breathing when she spoke, barely stuttering out words between pants for breath, \u201cOkay we really need to stop doing this.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou said that last time.\u201d Muttered Natasha, lazily withdrawing her fingers and unable to suppress a grin at the jerk of the hips the movement caused, \u201cAnd the time before that.\u201d </p><p>She was unable to hold back a laugh, gulping in air in a bid to catch her breath, \u201cI mean it this time.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou sure about that?\u201d Asked Natasha, raising her hand to the top of the other woman\u2019s back and pressing her index finger between her shoulder blades. Carol tilted her head from side to side, resisting the urge to squirm under the red head\u2019s touch as she dragged her finger slowly down her spine, \u201cCause I think it feels like you want me to fuck you again.\u201d </p><p>The noise that left Carol\u2019s lips was closer to a growl than anything. She so badly wanted to do the right thing, but in a post orgasmic daze and with the feeling of Natasha\u2019s fingers buried inside of her still so fresh, it was impossible to do anything but arch herself into the woman behind her. Who was to say this was so wrong anyway? </p><p>Turning on the spot, Carol grabbed Natasha\u2019s face in her hands and pulled her body flush against her own, \u201cI\u2019m being stupid right?\u201d </p><p>Natasha smirked, \u201cTotally stupid.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThought so.\u201d Carol nodded her head frantically, tugging the other woman\u2019s lips to meet her own and mumbling into her mouth, \u201cJust keep fucking me until I stop being stupid then.\u201d </p><p>Her smirk broadening, Natasha dipped her hand to plunge her fingers eagerly back inside of Carol, \u201cWhatever you say <i>Captain</i>.\u201d </p></p>",

I reblog one (1) carolnat fic and I have literally never had so many messages in one night for one thing. I haven\u2019t been able to reply to all of them because I didn\u2019t wanna spam everyone but believe me when I say YOU HAVE BEEN HEARD.

She was almost positive that she had seen darkened green eyes follow her around the room as she went about her work out routine in the gym. She was also certain that she had felt someone watching her while she lifted weights for the last fifteen minutes and her suspicions were confirmed as she bent down to pick up her towel and caught the eye of the red head on the other side of the room, daring to maintain eye contact as the other woman wet her lips before turning away. </p><p>It was impossible for Carol not to feel a little smug that her efforts hadn\u2019t gone unnoticed, slinging her towel over her shoulder before making her way out of the gym and heading for the showers. She hadn\u2019t gone to work out with the intention of flaunting herself so openly. However when she walked in and saw Natasha training alone as well, it had seemed like much too good an opportunity to miss. </p><p>Granted this was probably not the best of plans; to continue with what had been branded by both women as a \u2018terrible idea\u2019. It was messy and thoughtless and it only added another account to an already extensive list of complicated situations Carol\u2019s impulsiveness has gotten her into in the past. But stopping herself from acting in the moment had never been Carol\u2019s strong suit and with the mission at hand getting harder by the day, sources of comfort were in short supply. </p><p>A small part of her hoped that the other woman wouldn\u2019t follow her. That it would just make everything easier if the opportunity was simply taken away from her and she wouldn\u2019t have to resist alone. Throwing her work out gear onto the bench and retrieving a fresh towel from her locker, Carol wondered if it would just be for the best if Natasha ignored her this time and she was left to deal with things on her own. </p><p>Was that what she wanted though? <i>Definitely</i> not. </p><p>Her mind was plagued with memories of the times Natasha had helped her deal with the toll this mission was taking. <i>Teeth sinking into her shoulders followed by lips sucking and teasing darkened marks into her flesh. </i>Carol bunched her eyes closed and gave her head a shake before stepping onto the tiles beneath the shower head, pointlessly trying to banish the images from her brain. But still they kept coming. <i>Hardened nipples pressing into her back and a hot breath on the back of her neck as slender fingers slipped between her legs and were plunged inside of her. </i>Slamming her hand against the nozzle on the wall, Carol pushed out a long breath and looked down as the water began to fall over her. She rubbed at her eyes and then over her forehead to push the wet hair out of her face as she attempted to compose herself and just <i>think straight</i>. She was supposed to be here to help The Avengers. This was work and that meant being professional and making sure the job gets done. Natasha was a team mate and getting too personal with co workers was always destined to end badly, never mind sleeping together. </p><p>After several minutes of pep talk, Carol finally felt like she could feel her heart rate returning to normal, thoughts of naked, writhing flesh and moans of pleasure no longer consuming her mind. <i>It was a bad idea.</i></p><p>Her stomach dropped when she heard the faint sound of a footstep on the wet tiles behind her, her heart beginning to hammer again as she sensed the presence of someone close to her. </p><p>\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t.\u201d muttered Carol quietly, her statement sounding weak enough that it must have taken all of her effort just to say it.</p><p>There was no response, but she heard someone taking a few steps closer until eventually she felt the touch of someone else\u2019s skin graze lightly against her back. </p><p>\u201cHands \u2026 against the wall.\u201d </p><p>Carol huffed, leaning forward enough so that she could rest her forehead against the tiles and look down at the ground.

She seems to have caught Natasha&rsquo;s eye in particular </p><p>Warnings: Language, smut </p><p>Words: I dunno, a few. Maybe 1000. Maybe more</p><p><b>So it turns out peer pressure works. I errr .., yeah I&rsquo;ve kind of had a half a skeleton of this story sat in my drafts for a little while and I wasn&rsquo;t sure about posting it but it seems the people want it. I reblog one (1) carolnat fic and I have literally never had so many messages in one night for one thing. I haven&rsquo;t been able to reply to all of them because I didn&rsquo;t wanna spam everyone but believe me when I say YOU HAVE BEEN HEARD. Please please let me know what you think of this, I was super unsure about posting this, so if you enjoy it. Let me know! Behold: CarolNat</b></p><p><b>Ps. And do not even COME AT ME <i>AGAIN</i> about Carol being a bottom. It&rsquo;s a fact, let&rsquo;s move on </b></p><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"0\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"1\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><p>Carol had been sure her tactics to get the other woman&rsquo;s attention for the last couple of hours had been working. She was almost positive that she had seen darkened green eyes follow her around the room as she went about her work out routine in the gym. She was also certain that she had felt someone watching her while she lifted weights for the last fifteen minutes and her suspicions were confirmed as she bent down to pick up her towel and caught the eye of the red head on the other side of the room, daring to maintain eye contact as the other woman wet her lips before turning away. </p><p>It was impossible for Carol not to feel a little smug that her efforts hadn&rsquo;t gone unnoticed, slinging her towel over her shoulder before making her way out of the gym and heading for the showers. She hadn&rsquo;t gone to work out with the intention of flaunting herself so openly. However when she walked in and saw Natasha training alone as well, it had seemed like much too good an opportunity to miss. </p><p>Granted this was probably not the best of plans; to continue with what had been branded by both women as a &lsquo;terrible idea&rsquo;. It was messy and thoughtless and it only added another account to an already extensive list of complicated situations Carol&rsquo;s impulsiveness has gotten her into in the past. But stopping herself from acting in the moment had never been Carol&rsquo;s strong suit and with the mission at hand getting harder by the day, sources of comfort were in short supply. </p><p>A small part of her hoped that the other woman wouldn&rsquo;t follow her. That it would just make everything easier if the opportunity was simply taken away from her and she wouldn&rsquo;t have to resist alone. Throwing her work out gear onto the bench and retrieving a fresh towel from her locker, Carol wondered if it would just be for the best if Natasha ignored her this time and she was left to deal with things on her own. </p><p>Was that what she wanted though? <i>Definitely</i> not. </p><p>Her mind was plagued with memories of the times Natasha had helped her deal with the toll this mission was taking. <i>Teeth sinking into her shoulders followed by lips sucking and teasing darkened marks into her flesh. </i>Carol bunched her eyes closed and gave her head a shake before stepping onto the tiles beneath the shower head, pointlessly trying to banish the images from her brain. But still they kept coming. <i>Hardened nipples pressing into her back and a hot breath on the back of her neck as slender fingers slipped between her legs and were plunged inside of her. </i>Slamming her hand against the nozzle on the wall, Carol pushed out a long breath and looked down as the water began to fall over her. She rubbed at her eyes and then over her forehead to push the wet hair out of her face as she attempted to compose herself and just <i>think straight</i>. She was supposed to be here to help The Avengers. This was work and that meant being professional and making sure the job gets done. Natasha was a team mate and getting too personal with co workers was always destined to end badly, never mind sleeping together. </p><p>After several minutes of pep talk, Carol finally felt like she could feel her heart rate returning to normal, thoughts of naked, writhing flesh and moans of pleasure no longer consuming her mind. <i>It was a bad idea.</i></p><p>Her stomach dropped when she heard the faint sound of a footstep on the wet tiles behind her, her heart beginning to hammer again as she sensed the presence of someone close to her. </p><p>&ldquo;We shouldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo; muttered Carol quietly, her statement sounding weak enough that it must have taken all of her effort just to say it.</p><p>There was no response, but she heard someone taking a few steps closer until eventually she felt the touch of someone else&rsquo;s skin graze lightly against her back. </p><p>&ldquo;Hands &hellip; against the wall.&rdquo; </p><p>Carol huffed, leaning forward enough so that she could rest her forehead against the tiles and look down at the ground. She tried to focus on the water going down the drain in an attempt to ground herself and not succumb to what was about to happen. </p><p>&ldquo;Nat, really &hellip; this isn&rsquo;t a good idea.&rdquo; </p><p>Her eyes fell closed as she felt soft lips press a lingering kiss to the back of her neck followed by words spoken lowly into her ear, &ldquo;I said hands on the wall Danvers.&rdquo; </p><p>Pushing out a shaky breath, Carol shook her head from side to side against the wall of the shower as she tried to ignore the burning heat of arousal that was taking over her body. She knew it was pointless, already sure she was soaked just from <i>thinking</i> about what Natasha was capable of doing to her. There was no use fighting what she was feeling, her body already acting on impulse as she raised her arms to rest her hands either side of her head on the wall. She could practically hear the smirk on Natasha&rsquo;s face when she spoke again, </p><p>&ldquo;Feet apart.&rdquo; </p><p>This time she didn&rsquo;t hesitate before doing as she was told, shuffling her feet along the ground as she pushed out a shaky breath. The feeling of Natasha&rsquo;s fingers sinking into her hips to hold her in place only served in making her lose the last of her resolve. </p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it.&rdquo; said Natasha quietly, giving the inside of one of Carol&rsquo;s feet a gentle kick, &ldquo;Bit further princess.&rdquo; </p><p>Carol swallowed thickly as she did as she was asked, another wave of arousal washing over her at Natasha&rsquo;s words. She could only shiver and release a low moan as fingers skimmed over the inside of her thigh and she felt the other woman&rsquo;s breath hit her ear. </p><p>&ldquo;You still think we shouldn&rsquo;t?&rdquo; Asked Natasha, her tone taunting as she dragged her fingers a little further up Carol&rsquo;s leg, leaning forward enough that her breasts were pressed to the blonde&rsquo;s back. </p><p>Carol laughed quietly, the hairs on the back of her neck beginning to stand on end as Natasha&rsquo;s contact got heavier on her skin, &ldquo;I still think it&rsquo;s a bad idea.&rdquo; </p><p>Humming in response, Natasha pressed her lips to the side of Carol&rsquo;s neck, covering her skin with bites and open mouthed kisses as her hand reached the top of Carol&rsquo;s inner thigh and paused. </p><p>&ldquo;So you think I should stop?&rdquo; Asked Natasha quietly, teeth scraping against Carol&rsquo;s shoulder as she brushed a finger lightly over the length of her pussy. </p><p>Carol could only moan in response, fingers wiggling against the tiles as she tried to stop herself from just giving in entirely and pushing down onto Natasha&rsquo;s hand. </p><p>&ldquo;I asked you a question.&rdquo; Natasha paused to press a kiss underneath the other woman&rsquo;s ear, &ldquo;Do you want me to stop? I was under the impression I had to follow Captain&rsquo;s orders.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;God I hate that you&rsquo;re so good at this.&rdquo; groaned Carol, her tone only half serious. Already she felt like she had never been more turned on in her life, sure that evidence of her arousal had to be dripping down her thighs at this point. Natasha&rsquo;s fingers were continuing to move slowly, occasionally dipping lower just enough to graze her clit or tease her entrance before moving back, and each touch was causing Carol&rsquo;s hips to move involuntarily in a bid for more.</p><p>&ldquo;No you don&rsquo;t.&rdquo; Teased Natasha, finding it harder and harder to mask her own enjoyment as she felt how wet Carol was already. &ldquo;You want it or not?&rdquo; </p><p>Blowing out a sharp breath, Carol turned her head so she could just about see the red head out the corner of her eye, &ldquo;Yes, shit Nat just fuck me already.&rdquo; </p><p>The last thing Carol heard was a low chuckle from Natasha before the pulsing of blood in her ears blocked out everything as she felt the other woman push two fingers forcefully inside of her. If it hadn&rsquo;t been for her hands and forehead pressed against the tiles, she was positive she would have toppled over at the overwhelming sensation of pleasure that took over her as Natasha started to fuck her. The sounds of her moans already deafening as they echoed off the bathroom tiles but Carol couldn&rsquo;t bring herself to care as Natasha buried her fingers inside of her pussy again. </p><p>Each thrust and curl of her fingers felt incredible and Carol was struggling to think of any reason at all why she would ever have tried to fight this.  A loud groan of Natasha&rsquo;s name sounded through the showers as the red head slipped her other hand around Carol&rsquo;s waist towards her breast so that was able to pinch at one of her nipples, lips and teeth and tongue continuing their assault on the blonde&rsquo;s skin. </p><p>Carol&rsquo;s fingers scratched and scraped against the tiles in the hope of finding something, <i>anything</i> to hold onto as Natasha dipped her other hand lower so she was able to circle over her clit. She had found herself completely trapped between Natasha&rsquo;s body and the wall that she was near enough being pounded into, grateful for something holding her in place as her legs started to tremble beneath her. </p><p>&ldquo;Do you wanna come for me?&rdquo; Asked Natasha tauntingly, sinking her teeth into Carol&rsquo;s ear lobe and pressing harder against her clit as the other woman merely moaned and nodded her head eagerly. Her head was already spinning, body beginning to tingle as each push of Natasha&rsquo;s fingers brought her closer to the edge. She was desperately hoping Natasha would just <i>allow</i> her to come so easily, not failing to forget previous encounters when the red head would have her begging for it. But another curl of her digits as she circled over her clit again told her that this time, she wasn&rsquo;t going to be disappointed, &ldquo;Come on then pretty girl, I wanna hear how good I make you feel.&rdquo; </p><p>Allowing herself to be so desperately at someone&rsquo;s mercy was a new experience for Carol but the most bizarre thing about it all was how totally and completely she was into it. The almost mocking tone Natasha would use with her sometimes would send a shiver down her spine and it only made her moan out louder in pleasure. This, she had discovered, usually spurred the red head on more and would result in Carol getting exactly what she wanted. It seemed this time would be no different, the blonde groaning out loud in pleasure as Natasha slammed her fingers into her harder and she could feel her orgasm beginning to build in the pit of her stomach. </p><p>&ldquo;Oh my god, <i>fuck</i>-&ldquo; Carol dropped one of her hands from the wall as she felt herself tightening around the firm brush of fingertips inside of her, using it instead to grip Natasha&rsquo;s wrist both for something to help her keep upright and to make sure there was no risk of her stopping. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so close Nat, just a little&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>She didn&rsquo;t get a chance to finish her sentence as another buck of her hips against the other woman&rsquo;s hand was enough to push her over the edge, Natasha&rsquo;s fingers angled perfectly to hit the spot that made her see stars. The red head released a low groan of satisfaction as she felt Carol&rsquo;s pussy clench around her, a loud moan of her name sounding throughout the shower as her body shuddered and she came hard. </p><p>Allowing her to ride out her high, Natasha didn&rsquo;t stop the movement of her hand completely, slowing her pace as she rested her forehead against Carol&rsquo;s back and used the other hand to stroke gently over her hip. </p><p>Carol was still attempting to regulate her breathing when she spoke, barely stuttering out words between pants for breath, &ldquo;Okay we really need to stop doing this.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;You said that last time.&rdquo; Muttered Natasha, lazily withdrawing her fingers and unable to suppress a grin at the jerk of the hips the movement caused, &ldquo;And the time before that.&rdquo; </p><p>She was unable to hold back a laugh, gulping in air in a bid to catch her breath, &ldquo;I mean it this time.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;You sure about that?&rdquo; Asked Natasha, raising her hand to the top of the other woman&rsquo;s back and pressing her index finger between her shoulder blades. Carol tilted her head from side to side, resisting the urge to squirm under the red head&rsquo;s touch as she dragged her finger slowly down her spine, &ldquo;Cause I think it feels like you want me to fuck you again.&rdquo; </p><p>The noise that left Carol&rsquo;s lips was closer to a growl than anything.
