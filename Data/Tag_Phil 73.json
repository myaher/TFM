Phil Lester is a part-time intern, part-time employee at a local weather station, trying to get experience in his field and make a name for himself, while juggling a second job at the nearby Tesco\u2019s to give him some financial breathing room. Their paths were never supposed to meet, but what happens when they do anyways, one rainy day in Manchester?</i></p><p><i><a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Farchiveofourown.org%2Fworks%2F14006241%2Fchapters%2F32253558&amp;t=Nzc4MDVlZGE5MzUyYzczODIwZTA2NDBlZmY0ZjFiN2ZmMjhlYWE2YSwya21BM0tzeQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AzXkE4aLPqy740M1zPcWyew&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fphan-of-the-pen.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F174274134871%2Fi-dare-you-to-stay-chapter-11\">(ao3!)</a></i></p><p><i><a href=\"https://phan-of-the-pen.tumblr.com/post/184046704126/i-dare-you-to-stay-chapter-19\">&lt;\u2013 Previous chapter</a><br/><a href=\"https://phan-of-the-pen.tumblr.com/post/184374543596/i-dare-you-to-stay-chapter-21\">Next chapter &ndash;&gt;</a></i></p><p><i>~~~~~~~~~~</i></p><p>Dan doesn&rsquo;t see Phil the first day he gets back from London. </p><p>In fact, Dan doesn&rsquo;t see Phil until the third day he&rsquo;s back in Manchester. </p><!-- more --><p>As damning as it might sound, not all of the blame was on Phil, but it was mostly all on Dan. Dan had taken three days to destruct during the week that Phil had been away, and all 72 hours were pure hell. And after Dan managed to pull himself from his sheets enough to try and be a person, Dan threw himself into his work. When he needed some sort of explanation for his behavior, he had used the flimsy excuse of needing to make up for the three work shifts he missed. </p><p>They had both asked after him during those three days where he disappeared with no explanation, and when Dan only returned horribly drawn into himself and not acting normal, they had grown even more concerned. Dan couldn&rsquo;t remember when he had last received so many texts in such a short time. </p><p>When Phil had initially gotten back it was late at night, and even though Dan had been awake when Phil had texted him, he hadn&rsquo;t responded. The next day Phil had called him, telling Dan that he had a <i>loonngg</i> shift at the weather station. However, he still wanted to try and see Dan because it had been ages since they had last had some down time together. </p><p>Dan had nearly bitten his tongue off to keep himself from dropping a damaging, smartass comment about how little he had seen of his boyfriend and that spending this much time apart was basically normal. </p><p>He knew that Phil was trying. He didn&rsquo;t deserve something like that. </p><p>It was Dan, however, to shut down the possibility of them meeting that day. Dan still wasn&rsquo;t feeling normal, and he knew that he looked like a hot, depressed mess. He not only didn&rsquo;t want Phil to see him like this, but he also didn&rsquo;t want to have to try and pretend. Dan knew that if they saw each other their time would be extremely limited between both of their work schedules that day, and Dan was <i>well</i> aware of how not okay he was. If he saw Phil he would act even less normal because of all of the reasons why Dan was hurting inside, and they didn&rsquo;t have the time right now to try and work through it all. </p><p>So even though it cut something inside of him to hear the fall of Phil&rsquo;s voice at Dan&rsquo;s rejection, Dan stood by his decision. </p><p>That shift seemed extra long, and it wasn&rsquo;t because Dan was working a double. </p><p>The next day Dan gave Phil a similar reason. The third one\u2014the day they finally saw each other\u2014was only the fateful day because Phil had shown up to Dan&rsquo;s door. Dan had opened it, not really knowing who would be behind the door, but he had been puzzled to find Phil standing there. He was a bit disheveled and his eyebrows drawn together in concern; the lines those eyebrows made only grew deeper the moment that Phil saw Dan. </p><p>When he saw Phil, a part of Dan that he wasn&rsquo;t proud of wanted to find any excuse he could to run or hide because he didn&rsquo;t feel anywhere close to being able to handle this. Instead, he only opened the door wide enough for Phil to pass through, and led him into the lounge where they stood, five feet apart physically and even more in every other way that mattered. </p><p>Dan resisted the urge to squirm as Phil raked his eyes over Dan&rsquo;s frame. Dan had no doubts that he noticed the rumpled clothes, messy hair, his slightly thinner frame from not properly eating, and the deep eye bags from a lack of sleep. </p><p>&ldquo;Dan\u2026&rdquo; Phil breathed, like it was the only word he could manage. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;What are you apologizing for?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Pulling away from you when you got back. I know I shouldn&rsquo;t have shut you out like that, and I know you wanted to see me. I wanted to see you too, but just\u2026&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Just?&rdquo; Phil asked after Dan trailed off and didn&rsquo;t continue his sentence. </p><p>&ldquo;&hellip;not like <i>this</i>.&rdquo; </p><p>Phil&rsquo;s face softened, and he took a few steps forward to close the physical distance between them. He took Dan&rsquo;s hand into his after a moment. </p><p>&ldquo;Dan, there won&rsquo;t ever be a time when I don&rsquo;t want to see you. And when you&rsquo;re in a bad place I only want to be here more to help you.&rdquo; </p><p>Dan looked down. </p><p><i>You say this now. You don&rsquo;t know how bad it gets. </i></p><p>&ldquo;This has to do with you going M.I.A. last week, doesn&rsquo;t it? Dan,&rdquo; Phil said, his voice soft as can be, &ldquo;what happened to you while I was gone? I want to help, but&hellip;but you need to let me in.&rdquo; </p><p>Two sides in a bitter war rapidly formed in Dan&rsquo;s head. One was melting at Phil&rsquo;s words and swelling with the notion that Phil cared about him this much. The other was taking advantage of Dan&rsquo;s post-depressive-episode emotional state and rising with a terrible anger at Phil trying to talk about letting people in. Dan wasn&rsquo;t proud at how fast that darker side of him took over. </p><p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t really talk about letting people in when all you&rsquo;ve been doing for the past month is shutting me out.&rdquo; Dan bit back before he could even try and control his words. His hand slipped out of Phil&rsquo;s, and the part of Dan that didn&rsquo;t want to get angry screamed that this was going to manifest into one of Dan&rsquo;s many regrets if Dan kept acting like an asshole. </p><p>Phil looked confused for half of a second, but his expression immediately became guilty. </p><p>&ldquo;Dan, I know we haven&rsquo;t been spending a lot of time together lately, but it&rsquo;s just been work stuff, and I-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, like how over a month ago whatever the hell you had on your phone was only a change in schedule? Yeah, no offense but I&rsquo;m calling bullshit.&rdquo; </p><p>Dan had no idea where he was getting the anger or the energy for this. He had been so, so drained this whole week, and now his body decided to kick into high gear?</p><p>Phil&rsquo;s eyebrows crinkled once again, but this wasn&rsquo;t him being concerned. This was him stifling his anger. For some reason, that only made Dan madder. </p><p>&ldquo;What are you talking about?&rdquo; </p><p>Dan laughed. &ldquo;What am I talking about? Do you remember that movie night we had, and I took care of our trash. When I came back in you were on your phone, reading <i>something</i>, but you were so upset. You looked like you were going to throw your phone\u2014and I&rsquo;m sorry I was concerned about you\u2014but I asked you what was up, and you <i>lied</i> to me.&rdquo; </p><p>Phil huffed, and Dan watched agitation blossom in his eyes. </p><p>&ldquo;What, should I come to you whenever I get any notification now? Dan, that&rsquo;s like, three red flags of what should <i>not</i> be in a relationship.&rdquo; </p><p>Dan ran his hands through his hair, groaning. </p><p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t care what the <i>hell</i> you get on your phone. What I care about is that you fucking lied to my fucking face! That&rsquo;s the kind of shit my parents pulled all the damn time, and <i>fuck</i>, I can&rsquo;t <i>stand</i> when people fucking lie to me!&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Is this why you look like you&rsquo;ve been through the war? Have you been upset about this this whole time? I mean, Dan, I never meant-&rdquo; </p><p>Dan knew that this anger was his hyperactive depression taking the wheel and trying it&rsquo;s hardest to fuck up anything good in his life, but he felt powerless to stop it. He was spitting out words faster than his brain could try and regulate them. </p><p>&ldquo;Uh, yeah, I&rsquo;ve been sitting here for the past month trying to figure out why the <i>hell</i> my boyfriend lied to me and feels that he can&rsquo;t fucking trust me, but if you think that it&rsquo;s the <i>only</i> reason that I look like fucking shit then you are <i>sorely</i> wrong.&rdquo; Dan took a step forward, some sort of dam inside of him having been smashed to smithereens. &ldquo;I spent the the first two weeks of this year wondering why you were only pulling further and further away from me. I barely saw you, and when I did, it was for such a little amount of time. You dropped everything once your phone rang, but you didn&rsquo;t even bother to answer <i>half</i> of my texts.&rdquo; </p><p>Dan turned away and started to pace. He needed a way to get rid of all of this sudden energy that he had. </p><p>&ldquo;I spent the whole week before you left slipping into depression, and slowly getting stuck inside my head.&rdquo;<br/>&ldquo;You could have told me, I-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t even <i>try</i> and put this on me because you also could have done a lot too. And can you really blame me for thinking that you didn&rsquo;t want me to bother you? It&rsquo;s not like you seemed like you wanted anything to do with <i>me</i>.&rdquo; </p><p>Phil recoiled like he had been physically hit with Dan&rsquo;s words. </p><p>&ldquo;And when you left, <i>god</i>, it was just in time for me to fall apart completely. I spent<i> three fucking days</i> in bed thinking about how lonely I am and how the only two people in this world that I care about are moving on without me and how I&rsquo;m going to end up <i>alone</i>. And Phil that&rsquo;s not your fault, but the reason why I look like I&rsquo;ve been through the war is because I fucking <i>have</i> been. You don&rsquo;t get to try and berate me for pushing you out when that&rsquo;s <i>all</i> you&rsquo;ve been doing to me for the past fucking <i>month</i>.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan took a breath, clenching his fists and blew out the air in his lungs shakily. </p><p><i>God, I really need to calm the fuck down\u2026</i></p><p>A minute passed in complete silence while Dan gathered himself and tried to dampen the flames of anger inside of him. </p><p>When he started talking again, his voice was at a normal volume. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been hurting <i>so</i> bad. I know I could have told you, but you also could have noticed. I&rsquo;m upset that you lied to me. I&rsquo;m upset that you shut me out and flat out ignored me at times. I&rsquo;m upset that you didn&rsquo;t feel like you could trust me. I know I should have told you sooner, but I didn&rsquo;t want to spoil the holidays, and then you slipped away from me so quickly. I haven&rsquo;t exactly had the chance, and I&rsquo;m sorry I let it blow up to this. I&rsquo;m really sorry I just like, <i>screamed</i> at you, but <i>fuck</i>, it felt good to let it all out.&rdquo; </p><p>Dan slumped against his couch. The anger that had engulfed him had been sudden and complete, and it was gone as fast as it had arrived. </p><p>It was quiet for a moment&hellip;five&hellip;ten\u2026</p><p>&ldquo;The station isn&rsquo;t getting enough views anymore, and they can&rsquo;t keep losing money. The owners are dissolving the company to cut their losses, and the last broadcast is at the end of the month. I knew the owners really well so they&rsquo;ve endorsed me to a few other stations, but none of them would be based around here, and I&rsquo;d have to move.&rdquo; Phil said, quietly, his gaze on his feet. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been trying all of the other local weather stations to try and get a job, but none of them are hiring, even after calling in some favors and dropping a few names. I didn&rsquo;t want to tell you until I knew what I was doing.&rdquo; </p><p>Dan&rsquo;s jaw dropped at the words, horror seeping into his bones. </p><p>&ldquo;I\u2026&rdquo; Dan trailed off, not even knowing where to start. The attention to his phone, the never-ending phone calls, the constant long hours and appointments, they all fell into place and made much more sense than any half-baked explanation Dan had tried to come up with. </p><p>And <i>god</i> did Dan feel guilty. Phil had been dealing with all of this for so long, and he had undoubtedly been anxious and stressed over it, and what had Dan done? He had gotten worked up over the fact that he was missing a bit of attention, let it fuck with his head, and he had just fucking exploded at Phil for no good reason. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so fucking sorry,&rdquo; Dan breathed, and his voice sounded guilty, tight, and overwhelmed, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know, and I shouldn&rsquo;t have-&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;<i>Exactly</i>, Dan, that&rsquo;s exactly my point.&rdquo; Phil interrupted, tangling his fingers through Dan&rsquo;s. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t tell you because I was scared and selfish and I didn&rsquo;t want to admit that something like this was happening. I didn&rsquo;t think about how this would affect you, and now that my head isn&rsquo;t up my own arse <i>I&rsquo;m</i> sorry that I put you through that. I&rsquo;m sorry I lied to you, and I&rsquo;m sorry I kept pulling away from you.&rdquo; Phil laughed a little. &ldquo;I was so worried about protecting you from the stress I was going through that I didn&rsquo;t even see how my actions were affecting you.&rdquo; </p><p>They both fell quiet, and that silent moment with nothing but Phil&rsquo;s thumb rolling over Dan&rsquo;s knuckles was exactly what Dan needed to collect himself. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry I yelled at you. I know I already said that, but even if you were a bit of a jerk you didn&rsquo;t deserve it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I kind of did.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, you really didn&rsquo;t. Normally I&rsquo;m better at handling things like that, but I guess I&rsquo;m worn pretty thin to the bone right now. It&rsquo;s no excuse, but\u2026&rdquo;</p><p>Phil squeezed his hand. </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s alright. I promise I won&rsquo;t ever try and keep something like this from you. I learned my lesson, trust me.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Can I ask you something?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Sure.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;If the station is going under, why did they send you to that old guy? I would have thought that they would try and keep all the money they could.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Normally, yeah. The owners and I know each other really well though. They&rsquo;re friends of my parents and I grew up around them. When it was clear that the station wasn&rsquo;t going to survive, they wanted to give me all they could for me to make it somewhere else as a meteorologist. So they convinced their old colleague to mentor me for a week.&rdquo; </p><p>Dan hummed in response, thinking. There was one other question he wanted to ask, but he was afraid of the answer. </p><p>He decided to ask it anyways. </p><p>Being afraid had been what had gotten them into this mess in the first place. </p><p>&ldquo;Have you decided where you want to go yet?&rdquo; </p><p>Phil sighed, his shoulders sagging under an invisible weight. </p><p>&ldquo;No. The few places I was recommended to are too far for me to commute to, like I said, and I tried every local station I could.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;So what are you thinking of doing?&rdquo; </p><p>Phil bit his lip. </p><p>&ldquo;Nothing I guess. Keep trying, maybe hope that a local station gets an opening, but other than that&hellip;I don&rsquo;t think I can really do that much.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Wait a minute, Phil, you&rsquo;re just giving up? You can&rsquo;t do that, meteorology is your dream! You have a freaking degree in it, you&rsquo;ve worked so hard to get where you are, and you&rsquo;re just going to throw it out the window?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think I know that? I just\u2026&rdquo; Phil squeezed Dan&rsquo;s hand, and Dan&rsquo;s eye widened as he caught all of the words Phil was trying to convey to him without speaking. </p><p>&ldquo;Phil, you can&rsquo;t give up on your dream just because of me.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;m <i>giving up</i> on it, more like&hellip;pressing pause?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Phil.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Okay, fine, you caught me, I&rsquo;m not pursuing any of the other stations in the cities because I&rsquo;d have to move away from you, and I don&rsquo;t think I could do that.&rdquo; </p><p>Dan pulled Phil down with him onto the couch. They instinctively curled around each other, each of their bodies bending in the direction of the other. </p><p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t sacrifice your career for me. I won&rsquo;t let you.&rdquo; </p><p>Phil only continued to play with Dan&rsquo;s hand in his, not quite ignoring Dan&rsquo;s gaze, but not meeting it either. </p><p>&ldquo;Phil.&rdquo; </p><p>He looked up, and Dan tried to smile to reassure him. </p><p>&ldquo;Listen, if you want to pursue your dream of being a top meteorologist, then I&rsquo;ll stand by you, even if that means that you have to move across the country. You&rsquo;re special to me, Philip Lester, and I&rsquo;m willing to sacrifice a little cuddle time to see you happy and doing what you love. Besides, we can always visit each other.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Dan, we both know you can&rsquo;t really afford a lot of trips places, especially if they&rsquo;re far.&rdquo; </p><p>Dan shrugged. </p><p>&ldquo;A few doubles never hurt anyone.&quot;\u00a0</p><p>&quot;Dan, you already work way too much, there&rsquo;s no way I&rsquo;m letting you work <i>more</i> just for me.&quot;\u00a0</p><p>&quot;Shhh,&rdquo; Dan interrupted. The stress of trying to come up with the money to visit Phil regularly would bear down on him later, but Dan didn&rsquo;t want to think about it right now. Right now he was so, so <i>fond</i> of this man in front of him. This man who knew that something like this would stress Dan out of his mind, and tried\u2014even if he went about it the wrong way\u2014to relieve that stress. </p><p>Relationships needed effort from both sides to work, and sometimes that effort wasn&rsquo;t quite equal. Right now, Dan needed to put in a little more effort, and that was okay. He could do it. He <i>wanted</i> to do it. He wanted to fight for this beautiful, incredible, amazing thing in his life. </p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get through this, alright? You don&rsquo;t have to worry; I&rsquo;m not going anywhere.&rdquo; </p><p>Phil&rsquo;s frame relaxed at Dan&rsquo;s words, and relief oozed from him. He let his hand cup Dan&rsquo;s head and gently pulled him into a kiss. </p><p>&ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo; </p>",

Dan had taken three days to destruct during the week that Phil had been away, and all 72 hours were pure hell. And after Dan managed to pull himself from his sheets enough to try and be a person, Dan threw himself into his work. When he needed some sort of explanation for his behavior, he had used the flimsy excuse of needing to make up for the three work shifts he missed. </p><p>They had both asked after him during those three days where he disappeared with no explanation, and when Dan only returned horribly drawn into himself and not acting normal, they had grown even more concerned. Dan couldn\u2019t remember when he had last received so many texts in such a short time. </p><p>When Phil had initially gotten back it was late at night, and even though Dan had been awake when Phil had texted him, he hadn\u2019t responded. The next day Phil had called him, telling Dan that he had a <i>loonngg</i> shift at the weather station. However, he still wanted to try and see Dan because it had been ages since they had last had some down time together. </p><p>Dan had nearly bitten his tongue off to keep himself from dropping a damaging, smartass comment about how little he had seen of his boyfriend and that spending this much time apart was basically normal. </p><p>He knew that Phil was trying. He didn\u2019t deserve something like that. </p><p>It was Dan, however, to shut down the possibility of them meeting that day. Dan still wasn\u2019t feeling normal, and he knew that he looked like a hot, depressed mess. He not only didn\u2019t want Phil to see him like this, but he also didn\u2019t want to have to try and pretend. Dan knew that if they saw each other their time would be extremely limited between both of their work schedules that day, and Dan was <i>well</i> aware of how not okay he was. If he saw Phil he would act even less normal because of all of the reasons why Dan was hurting inside, and they didn\u2019t have the time right now to try and work through it all. </p><p>So even though it cut something inside of him to hear the fall of Phil\u2019s voice at Dan\u2019s rejection, Dan stood by his decision. </p><p>That shift seemed extra long, and it wasn\u2019t because Dan was working a double. </p><p>The next day Dan gave Phil a similar reason. The third one\u2014the day they finally saw each other\u2014was only the fateful day because Phil had shown up to Dan\u2019s door. Dan had opened it, not really knowing who would be behind the door, but he had been puzzled to find Phil standing there. He was a bit disheveled and his eyebrows drawn together in concern; the lines those eyebrows made only grew deeper the moment that Phil saw Dan. </p><p>When he saw Phil, a part of Dan that he wasn\u2019t proud of wanted to find any excuse he could to run or hide because he didn\u2019t feel anywhere close to being able to handle this. Instead, he only opened the door wide enough for Phil to pass through, and led him into the lounge where they stood, five feet apart physically and even more in every other way that mattered. </p><p>Dan resisted the urge to squirm as Phil raked his eyes over Dan\u2019s frame. Dan had no doubts that he noticed the rumpled clothes, messy hair, his slightly thinner frame from not properly eating, and the deep eye bags from a lack of sleep. </p><p>\u201cDan\u2026\u201d Phil breathed, like it was the only word he could manage. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhat are you apologizing for?\u201d </p><p>\u201cPulling away from you when you got back. I know I shouldn\u2019t have shut you out like that, and I know you wanted to see me. I wanted to see you too, but just\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust?\u201d Phil asked after Dan trailed off and didn\u2019t continue his sentence. </p><p>\u201c\u2026not like <i>this</i>.\u201d </p><p>Phil\u2019s face softened, and he took a few steps forward to close the physical distance between them. He took Dan\u2019s hand into his after a moment. </p><p>\u201cDan, there won\u2019t ever be a time when I don\u2019t want to see you. And when you\u2019re in a bad place I only want to be here more to help you.\u201d </p><p>Dan looked down. </p><p><i>You say this now. You don\u2019t know how bad it gets. </i></p><p>\u201cThis has to do with you going M.I.A. last week, doesn\u2019t it? Dan,\u201d Phil said, his voice soft as can be, \u201cwhat happened to you while I was gone? I want to help, but\u2026but you need to let me in.\u201d </p><p>Two sides in a bitter war rapidly formed in Dan\u2019s head. One was melting at Phil\u2019s words and swelling with the notion that Phil cared about him this much. The other was taking advantage of Dan\u2019s post-depressive-episode emotional state and rising with a terrible anger at Phil trying to talk about letting people in. Dan wasn\u2019t proud at how fast that darker side of him took over. </p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t really talk about letting people in when all you\u2019ve been doing for the past month is shutting me out.\u201d Dan bit back before he could even try and control his words. His hand slipped out of Phil\u2019s, and the part of Dan that didn\u2019t want to get angry screamed that this was going to manifest into one of Dan\u2019s many regrets if Dan kept acting like an asshole. </p><p>Phil looked confused for half of a second, but his expression immediately became guilty. </p><p>\u201cDan, I know we haven\u2019t been spending a lot of time together lately, but it\u2019s just been work stuff, and I-\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, like how over a month ago whatever the hell you had on your phone was only a change in schedule? Yeah, no offense but I\u2019m calling bullshit.\u201d </p><p>Dan had no idea where he was getting the anger or the energy for this. He had been so, so drained this whole week, and now his body decided to kick into high gear?</p><p>Phil\u2019s eyebrows crinkled once again, but this wasn\u2019t him being concerned. This was him stifling his anger. For some reason, that only made Dan madder. </p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d </p><p>Dan laughed. \u201cWhat am I talking about? Do you remember that movie night we had, and I took care of our trash. When I came back in you were on your phone, reading <i>something</i>, but you were so upset. You looked like you were going to throw your phone\u2014and I\u2019m sorry I was concerned about you\u2014but I asked you what was up, and you <i>lied</i> to me.\u201d </p><p>Phil huffed, and Dan watched agitation blossom in his eyes. </p><p>\u201cWhat, should I come to you whenever I get any notification now? Dan, that\u2019s like, three red flags of what should <i>not</i> be in a relationship.\u201d </p><p>Dan ran his hands through his hair, groaning. </p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t care what the <i>hell</i> you get on your phone. What I care about is that you fucking lied to my fucking face! That\u2019s the kind of shit my parents pulled all the damn time, and <i>fuck</i>, I can\u2019t <i>stand</i> when people fucking lie to me!\u201d </p><p>\u201cIs this why you look like you\u2019ve been through the war? Have you been upset about this this whole time? I mean, Dan, I never meant-\u201d </p><p>Dan knew that this anger was his hyperactive depression taking the wheel and trying it\u2019s hardest to fuck up anything good in his life, but he felt powerless to stop it. He was spitting out words faster than his brain could try and regulate them. </p><p>\u201cUh, yeah, I\u2019ve been sitting here for the past month trying to figure out why the <i>hell</i> my boyfriend lied to me and feels that he can\u2019t fucking trust me, but if you think that it\u2019s the <i>only</i> reason that I look like fucking shit then you are <i>sorely</i> wrong.\u201d Dan took a step forward, some sort of dam inside of him having been smashed to smithereens. \u201cI spent the the first two weeks of this year wondering why you were only pulling further and further away from me. I barely saw you, and when I did, it was for such a little amount of time. You dropped everything once your phone rang, but you didn\u2019t even bother to answer <i>half</i> of my texts.\u201d </p><p>Dan turned away and started to pace. He needed a way to get rid of all of this sudden energy that he had. </p><p>\u201cI spent the whole week before you left slipping into depression, and slowly getting stuck inside my head.\u201d<br>\u201cYou could have told me, I-\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t even <i>try</i> and put this on me because you also could have done a lot too. And can you really blame me for thinking that you didn\u2019t want me to bother you? It\u2019s not like you seemed like you wanted anything to do with <i>me</i>.\u201d </p><p>Phil recoiled like he had been physically hit with Dan\u2019s words. </p><p>\u201cAnd when you left, <i>god</i>, it was just in time for me to fall apart completely. I spent<i> three fucking days</i> in bed thinking about how lonely I am and how the only two people in this world that I care about are moving on without me and how I\u2019m going to end up <i>alone</i>. And Phil that\u2019s not your fault, but the reason why I look like I\u2019ve been through the war is because I fucking <i>have</i> been. You don\u2019t get to try and berate me for pushing you out when that\u2019s <i>all</i> you\u2019ve been doing to me for the past fucking <i>month</i>.\u201d</p><p>Dan took a breath, clenching his fists and blew out the air in his lungs shakily. </p><p><i>God, I really need to calm the fuck down\u2026</i></p><p>A minute passed in complete silence while Dan gathered himself and tried to dampen the flames of anger inside of him. </p><p>When he started talking again, his voice was at a normal volume. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been hurting <i>so</i> bad. I know I could have told you, but you also could have noticed. I\u2019m upset that you lied to me. I\u2019m upset that you shut me out and flat out ignored me at times. I\u2019m upset that you didn\u2019t feel like you could trust me. I know I should have told you sooner, but I didn\u2019t want to spoil the holidays, and then you slipped away from me so quickly. I haven\u2019t exactly had the chance, and I\u2019m sorry I let it blow up to this. I\u2019m really sorry I just like, <i>screamed</i> at you, but <i>fuck</i>, it felt good to let it all out.\u201d </p><p>Dan slumped against his couch. The anger that had engulfed him had been sudden and complete, and it was gone as fast as it had arrived. </p><p>It was quiet for a moment\u2026five\u2026ten\u2026</p><p>\u201cThe station isn\u2019t getting enough views anymore, and they can\u2019t keep losing money. The owners are dissolving the company to cut their losses, and the last broadcast is at the end of the month. I knew the owners really well so they\u2019ve endorsed me to a few other stations, but none of them would be based around here, and I\u2019d have to move.\u201d Phil said, quietly, his gaze on his feet. \u201cI\u2019ve been trying all of the other local weather stations to try and get a job, but none of them are hiring, even after calling in some favors and dropping a few names. I didn\u2019t want to tell you until I knew what I was doing.\u201d </p><p>Dan\u2019s jaw dropped at the words, horror seeping into his bones. </p><p>\u201cI\u2026\u201d Dan trailed off, not even knowing where to start. The attention to his phone, the never-ending phone calls, the constant long hours and appointments, they all fell into place and made much more sense than any half-baked explanation Dan had tried to come up with. </p><p>And <i>god</i> did Dan feel guilty. Phil had been dealing with all of this for so long, and he had undoubtedly been anxious and stressed over it, and what had Dan done? He had gotten worked up over the fact that he was missing a bit of attention, let it fuck with his head, and he had just fucking exploded at Phil for no good reason. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so fucking sorry,\u201d Dan breathed, and his voice sounded guilty, tight, and overwhelmed, \u201cI didn\u2019t know, and I shouldn\u2019t have-\u201d </p><p>\u201c<i>Exactly</i>, Dan, that\u2019s exactly my point.\u201d Phil interrupted, tangling his fingers through Dan\u2019s. \u201cI didn\u2019t tell you because I was scared and selfish and I didn\u2019t want to admit that something like this was happening. I didn\u2019t think about how this would affect you, and now that my head isn\u2019t up my own arse <i>I\u2019m</i> sorry that I put you through that. I\u2019m sorry I lied to you, and I\u2019m sorry I kept pulling away from you.\u201d Phil laughed a little. \u201cI was so worried about protecting you from the stress I was going through that I didn\u2019t even see how my actions were affecting you.\u201d </p><p>They both fell quiet, and that silent moment with nothing but Phil\u2019s thumb rolling over Dan\u2019s knuckles was exactly what Dan needed to collect himself. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I yelled at you. I know I already said that, but even if you were a bit of a jerk you didn\u2019t deserve it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI kind of did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you really didn\u2019t. Normally I\u2019m better at handling things like that, but I guess I\u2019m worn pretty thin to the bone right now. It\u2019s no excuse, but\u2026\u201d</p><p>Phil squeezed his hand. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s alright. I promise I won\u2019t ever try and keep something like this from you. I learned my lesson, trust me.\u201d </p><p>\u201cCan I ask you something?\u201d </p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d </p><p>\u201cIf the station is going under, why did they send you to that old guy? I would have thought that they would try and keep all the money they could.\u201d </p><p>\u201cNormally, yeah. The owners and I know each other really well though. They\u2019re friends of my parents and I grew up around them. When it was clear that the station wasn\u2019t going to survive, they wanted to give me all they could for me to make it somewhere else as a meteorologist. So they convinced their old colleague to mentor me for a week.\u201d </p><p>Dan hummed in response, thinking. There was one other question he wanted to ask, but he was afraid of the answer. </p><p>He decided to ask it anyways. </p><p>Being afraid had been what had gotten them into this mess in the first place. </p><p>\u201cHave you decided where you want to go yet?\u201d </p><p>Phil sighed, his shoulders sagging under an invisible weight. </p><p>\u201cNo. The few places I was recommended to are too far for me to commute to, like I said, and I tried every local station I could.\u201d </p><p>\u201cSo what are you thinking of doing?\u201d </p><p>Phil bit his lip. </p><p>\u201cNothing I guess. Keep trying, maybe hope that a local station gets an opening, but other than that\u2026I don\u2019t think I can really do that much.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWait a minute, Phil, you\u2019re just giving up? You can\u2019t do that, meteorology is your dream! You have a freaking degree in it, you\u2019ve worked so hard to get where you are, and you\u2019re just going to throw it out the window?\u201d </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think I know that? I just\u2026\u201d Phil squeezed Dan\u2019s hand, and Dan\u2019s eye widened as he caught all of the words Phil was trying to convey to him without speaking. </p><p>\u201cPhil, you can\u2019t give up on your dream just because of me.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019m <i>giving up</i> on it, more like\u2026pressing pause?\u201d </p><p>\u201cPhil.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOkay, fine, you caught me, I\u2019m not pursuing any of the other stations in the cities because I\u2019d have to move away from you, and I don\u2019t think I could do that.\u201d </p><p>Dan pulled Phil down with him onto the couch. They instinctively curled around each other, each of their bodies bending in the direction of the other. </p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t sacrifice your career for me. I won\u2019t let you.\u201d </p><p>Phil only continued to play with Dan\u2019s hand in his, not quite ignoring Dan\u2019s gaze, but not meeting it either. </p><p>\u201cPhil.\u201d </p><p>He looked up, and Dan tried to smile to reassure him. </p><p>\u201cListen, if you want to pursue your dream of being a top meteorologist, then I\u2019ll stand by you, even if that means that you have to move across the country. You\u2019re special to me, Philip Lester, and I\u2019m willing to sacrifice a little cuddle time to see you happy and doing what you love. Besides, we can always visit each other.\u201d </p><p>\u201cDan, we both know you can\u2019t really afford a lot of trips places, especially if they\u2019re far.\u201d </p><p>Dan shrugged. </p><p>\u201cA few doubles never hurt anyone.\"\u00a0</p><p>\"Dan, you already work way too much, there\u2019s no way I\u2019m letting you work <i>more</i> just for me.\"\u00a0</p><p>\"Shhh,\u201d Dan interrupted. The stress of trying to come up with the money to visit Phil regularly would bear down on him later, but Dan didn\u2019t want to think about it right now. Right now he was so, so <i>fond</i> of this man in front of him. This man who knew that something like this would stress Dan out of his mind, and tried\u2014even if he went about it the wrong way\u2014to relieve that stress. </p><p>Relationships needed effort from both sides to work, and sometimes that effort wasn\u2019t quite equal. Right now, Dan needed to put in a little more effort, and that was okay. He could do it. He <i>wanted</i> to do it. He wanted to fight for this beautiful, incredible, amazing thing in his life. </p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll get through this, alright? You don\u2019t have to worry; I\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201d </p><p>Phil\u2019s frame relaxed at Dan\u2019s words, and relief oozed from him. He let his hand cup Dan\u2019s head and gently pulled him into a kiss. </p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d </p>",

Dan had taken three days to destruct during the week that Phil had been away, and all 72 hours were pure hell. And after Dan managed to pull himself from his sheets enough to try and be a person, Dan threw himself into his work. When he needed some sort of explanation for his behavior, he had used the flimsy excuse of needing to make up for the three work shifts he missed. </p><p>They had both asked after him during those three days where he disappeared with no explanation, and when Dan only returned horribly drawn into himself and not acting normal, they had grown even more concerned. Dan couldn\u2019t remember when he had last received so many texts in such a short time. </p><p>When Phil had initially gotten back it was late at night, and even though Dan had been awake when Phil had texted him, he hadn\u2019t responded. The next day Phil had called him, telling Dan that he had a <i>loonngg</i> shift at the weather station. However, he still wanted to try and see Dan because it had been ages since they had last had some down time together. </p><p>Dan had nearly bitten his tongue off to keep himself from dropping a damaging, smartass comment about how little he had seen of his boyfriend and that spending this much time apart was basically normal. </p><p>He knew that Phil was trying. He didn\u2019t deserve something like that. </p><p>It was Dan, however, to shut down the possibility of them meeting that day. Dan still wasn\u2019t feeling normal, and he knew that he looked like a hot, depressed mess. He not only didn\u2019t want Phil to see him like this, but he also didn\u2019t want to have to try and pretend. Dan knew that if they saw each other their time would be extremely limited between both of their work schedules that day, and Dan was <i>well</i> aware of how not okay he was. If he saw Phil he would act even less normal because of all of the reasons why Dan was hurting inside, and they didn\u2019t have the time right now to try and work through it all. </p><p>So even though it cut something inside of him to hear the fall of Phil\u2019s voice at Dan\u2019s rejection, Dan stood by his decision. </p><p>That shift seemed extra long, and it wasn\u2019t because Dan was working a double. </p><p>The next day Dan gave Phil a similar reason. The third one\u2014the day they finally saw each other\u2014was only the fateful day because Phil had shown up to Dan\u2019s door. Dan had opened it, not really knowing who would be behind the door, but he had been puzzled to find Phil standing there. He was a bit disheveled and his eyebrows drawn together in concern; the lines those eyebrows made only grew deeper the moment that Phil saw Dan. </p><p>When he saw Phil, a part of Dan that he wasn\u2019t proud of wanted to find any excuse he could to run or hide because he didn\u2019t feel anywhere close to being able to handle this. Instead, he only opened the door wide enough for Phil to pass through, and led him into the lounge where they stood, five feet apart physically and even more in every other way that mattered. </p><p>Dan resisted the urge to squirm as Phil raked his eyes over Dan\u2019s frame. Dan had no doubts that he noticed the rumpled clothes, messy hair, his slightly thinner frame from not properly eating, and the deep eye bags from a lack of sleep. </p><p>\u201cDan\u2026\u201d Phil breathed, like it was the only word he could manage. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhat are you apologizing for?\u201d </p><p>\u201cPulling away from you when you got back. I know I shouldn\u2019t have shut you out like that, and I know you wanted to see me. I wanted to see you too, but just\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust?\u201d Phil asked after Dan trailed off and didn\u2019t continue his sentence. </p><p>\u201c\u2026not like <i>this</i>.\u201d </p><p>Phil\u2019s face softened, and he took a few steps forward to close the physical distance between them. He took Dan\u2019s hand into his after a moment. </p><p>\u201cDan, there won\u2019t ever be a time when I don\u2019t want to see you. And when you\u2019re in a bad place I only want to be here more to help you.\u201d </p><p>Dan looked down. </p><p><i>You say this now. You don\u2019t know how bad it gets. </i></p><p>\u201cThis has to do with you going M.I.A. last week, doesn\u2019t it? Dan,\u201d Phil said, his voice soft as can be, \u201cwhat happened to you while I was gone? I want to help, but\u2026but you need to let me in.\u201d </p><p>Two sides in a bitter war rapidly formed in Dan\u2019s head. One was melting at Phil\u2019s words and swelling with the notion that Phil cared about him this much. The other was taking advantage of Dan\u2019s post-depressive-episode emotional state and rising with a terrible anger at Phil trying to talk about letting people in. Dan wasn\u2019t proud at how fast that darker side of him took over. </p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t really talk about letting people in when all you\u2019ve been doing for the past month is shutting me out.\u201d Dan bit back before he could even try and control his words. His hand slipped out of Phil\u2019s, and the part of Dan that didn\u2019t want to get angry screamed that this was going to manifest into one of Dan\u2019s many regrets if Dan kept acting like an asshole. </p><p>Phil looked confused for half of a second, but his expression immediately became guilty. </p><p>\u201cDan, I know we haven\u2019t been spending a lot of time together lately, but it\u2019s just been work stuff, and I-\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, like how over a month ago whatever the hell you had on your phone was only a change in schedule? Yeah, no offense but I\u2019m calling bullshit.\u201d </p><p>Dan had no idea where he was getting the anger or the energy for this. He had been so, so drained this whole week, and now his body decided to kick into high gear?</p><p>Phil\u2019s eyebrows crinkled once again, but this wasn\u2019t him being concerned. This was him stifling his anger. For some reason, that only made Dan madder. </p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d </p><p>Dan laughed. \u201cWhat am I talking about? Do you remember that movie night we had, and I took care of our trash. When I came back in you were on your phone, reading <i>something</i>, but you were so upset. You looked like you were going to throw your phone\u2014and I\u2019m sorry I was concerned about you\u2014but I asked you what was up, and you <i>lied</i> to me.\u201d </p><p>Phil huffed, and Dan watched agitation blossom in his eyes. </p><p>\u201cWhat, should I come to you whenever I get any notification now? Dan, that\u2019s like, three red flags of what should <i>not</i> be in a relationship.\u201d </p><p>Dan ran his hands through his hair, groaning. </p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t care what the <i>hell</i> you get on your phone. What I care about is that you fucking lied to my fucking face! That\u2019s the kind of shit my parents pulled all the damn time, and <i>fuck</i>, I can\u2019t <i>stand</i> when people fucking lie to me!\u201d </p><p>\u201cIs this why you look like you\u2019ve been through the war? Have you been upset about this this whole time? I mean, Dan, I never meant-\u201d </p><p>Dan knew that this anger was his hyperactive depression taking the wheel and trying it\u2019s hardest to fuck up anything good in his life, but he felt powerless to stop it. He was spitting out words faster than his brain could try and regulate them. </p><p>\u201cUh, yeah, I\u2019ve been sitting here for the past month trying to figure out why the <i>hell</i> my boyfriend lied to me and feels that he can\u2019t fucking trust me, but if you think that it\u2019s the <i>only</i> reason that I look like fucking shit then you are <i>sorely</i> wrong.\u201d Dan took a step forward, some sort of dam inside of him having been smashed to smithereens. \u201cI spent the the first two weeks of this year wondering why you were only pulling further and further away from me. I barely saw you, and when I did, it was for such a little amount of time. You dropped everything once your phone rang, but you didn\u2019t even bother to answer <i>half</i> of my texts.\u201d </p><p>Dan turned away and started to pace. He needed a way to get rid of all of this sudden energy that he had. </p><p>\u201cI spent the whole week before you left slipping into depression, and slowly getting stuck inside my head.\u201d<br>\u201cYou could have told me, I-\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t even <i>try</i> and put this on me because you also could have done a lot too. And can you really blame me for thinking that you didn\u2019t want me to bother you? It\u2019s not like you seemed like you wanted anything to do with <i>me</i>.\u201d </p><p>Phil recoiled like he had been physically hit with Dan\u2019s words. </p><p>\u201cAnd when you left, <i>god</i>, it was just in time for me to fall apart completely. I spent<i> three fucking days</i> in bed thinking about how lonely I am and how the only two people in this world that I care about are moving on without me and how I\u2019m going to end up <i>alone</i>. And Phil that\u2019s not your fault, but the reason why I look like I\u2019ve been through the war is because I fucking <i>have</i> been. You don\u2019t get to try and berate me for pushing you out when that\u2019s <i>all</i> you\u2019ve been doing to me for the past fucking <i>month</i>.\u201d</p><p>Dan took a breath, clenching his fists and blew out the air in his lungs shakily. </p><p><i>God, I really need to calm the fuck down\u2026</i></p><p>A minute passed in complete silence while Dan gathered himself and tried to dampen the flames of anger inside of him. </p><p>When he started talking again, his voice was at a normal volume. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been hurting <i>so</i> bad. I know I could have told you, but you also could have noticed. I\u2019m upset that you lied to me. I\u2019m upset that you shut me out and flat out ignored me at times. I\u2019m upset that you didn\u2019t feel like you could trust me. I know I should have told you sooner, but I didn\u2019t want to spoil the holidays, and then you slipped away from me so quickly. I haven\u2019t exactly had the chance, and I\u2019m sorry I let it blow up to this. I\u2019m really sorry I just like, <i>screamed</i> at you, but <i>fuck</i>, it felt good to let it all out.\u201d </p><p>Dan slumped against his couch. The anger that had engulfed him had been sudden and complete, and it was gone as fast as it had arrived. </p><p>It was quiet for a moment\u2026five\u2026ten\u2026</p><p>\u201cThe station isn\u2019t getting enough views anymore, and they can\u2019t keep losing money. The owners are dissolving the company to cut their losses, and the last broadcast is at the end of the month. I knew the owners really well so they\u2019ve endorsed me to a few other stations, but none of them would be based around here, and I\u2019d have to move.\u201d Phil said, quietly, his gaze on his feet. \u201cI\u2019ve been trying all of the other local weather stations to try and get a job, but none of them are hiring, even after calling in some favors and dropping a few names. I didn\u2019t want to tell you until I knew what I was doing.\u201d </p><p>Dan\u2019s jaw dropped at the words, horror seeping into his bones. </p><p>\u201cI\u2026\u201d Dan trailed off, not even knowing where to start. The attention to his phone, the never-ending phone calls, the constant long hours and appointments, they all fell into place and made much more sense than any half-baked explanation Dan had tried to come up with. </p><p>And <i>god</i> did Dan feel guilty. Phil had been dealing with all of this for so long, and he had undoubtedly been anxious and stressed over it, and what had Dan done? He had gotten worked up over the fact that he was missing a bit of attention, let it fuck with his head, and he had just fucking exploded at Phil for no good reason. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so fucking sorry,\u201d Dan breathed, and his voice sounded guilty, tight, and overwhelmed, \u201cI didn\u2019t know, and I shouldn\u2019t have-\u201d </p><p>\u201c<i>Exactly</i>, Dan, that\u2019s exactly my point.\u201d Phil interrupted, tangling his fingers through Dan\u2019s. \u201cI didn\u2019t tell you because I was scared and selfish and I didn\u2019t want to admit that something like this was happening. I didn\u2019t think about how this would affect you, and now that my head isn\u2019t up my own arse <i>I\u2019m</i> sorry that I put you through that. I\u2019m sorry I lied to you, and I\u2019m sorry I kept pulling away from you.\u201d Phil laughed a little. \u201cI was so worried about protecting you from the stress I was going through that I didn\u2019t even see how my actions were affecting you.\u201d </p><p>They both fell quiet, and that silent moment with nothing but Phil\u2019s thumb rolling over Dan\u2019s knuckles was exactly what Dan needed to collect himself. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I yelled at you. I know I already said that, but even if you were a bit of a jerk you didn\u2019t deserve it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI kind of did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you really didn\u2019t. Normally I\u2019m better at handling things like that, but I guess I\u2019m worn pretty thin to the bone right now. It\u2019s no excuse, but\u2026\u201d</p><p>Phil squeezed his hand. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s alright. I promise I won\u2019t ever try and keep something like this from you. I learned my lesson, trust me.\u201d </p><p>\u201cCan I ask you something?\u201d </p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d </p><p>\u201cIf the station is going under, why did they send you to that old guy? I would have thought that they would try and keep all the money they could.\u201d </p><p>\u201cNormally, yeah. The owners and I know each other really well though. They\u2019re friends of my parents and I grew up around them. When it was clear that the station wasn\u2019t going to survive, they wanted to give me all they could for me to make it somewhere else as a meteorologist. So they convinced their old colleague to mentor me for a week.\u201d </p><p>Dan hummed in response, thinking. There was one other question he wanted to ask, but he was afraid of the answer. </p><p>He decided to ask it anyways. </p><p>Being afraid had been what had gotten them into this mess in the first place. </p><p>\u201cHave you decided where you want to go yet?\u201d </p><p>Phil sighed, his shoulders sagging under an invisible weight. </p><p>\u201cNo. The few places I was recommended to are too far for me to commute to, like I said, and I tried every local station I could.\u201d </p><p>\u201cSo what are you thinking of doing?\u201d </p><p>Phil bit his lip. </p><p>\u201cNothing I guess. Keep trying, maybe hope that a local station gets an opening, but other than that\u2026I don\u2019t think I can really do that much.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWait a minute, Phil, you\u2019re just giving up? You can\u2019t do that, meteorology is your dream! You have a freaking degree in it, you\u2019ve worked so hard to get where you are, and you\u2019re just going to throw it out the window?\u201d </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think I know that? I just\u2026\u201d Phil squeezed Dan\u2019s hand, and Dan\u2019s eye widened as he caught all of the words Phil was trying to convey to him without speaking. </p><p>\u201cPhil, you can\u2019t give up on your dream just because of me.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019m <i>giving up</i> on it, more like\u2026pressing pause?\u201d </p><p>\u201cPhil.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOkay, fine, you caught me, I\u2019m not pursuing any of the other stations in the cities because I\u2019d have to move away from you, and I don\u2019t think I could do that.\u201d </p><p>Dan pulled Phil down with him onto the couch. They instinctively curled around each other, each of their bodies bending in the direction of the other. </p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t sacrifice your career for me. I won\u2019t let you.\u201d </p><p>Phil only continued to play with Dan\u2019s hand in his, not quite ignoring Dan\u2019s gaze, but not meeting it either. </p><p>\u201cPhil.\u201d </p><p>He looked up, and Dan tried to smile to reassure him. </p><p>\u201cListen, if you want to pursue your dream of being a top meteorologist, then I\u2019ll stand by you, even if that means that you have to move across the country. You\u2019re special to me, Philip Lester, and I\u2019m willing to sacrifice a little cuddle time to see you happy and doing what you love. Besides, we can always visit each other.\u201d </p><p>\u201cDan, we both know you can\u2019t really afford a lot of trips places, especially if they\u2019re far.\u201d </p><p>Dan shrugged. </p><p>\u201cA few doubles never hurt anyone.\"\u00a0</p><p>\"Dan, you already work way too much, there\u2019s no way I\u2019m letting you work <i>more</i> just for me.\"\u00a0</p><p>\"Shhh,\u201d Dan interrupted. The stress of trying to come up with the money to visit Phil regularly would bear down on him later, but Dan didn\u2019t want to think about it right now. Right now he was so, so <i>fond</i> of this man in front of him. This man who knew that something like this would stress Dan out of his mind, and tried\u2014even if he went about it the wrong way\u2014to relieve that stress. </p><p>Relationships needed effort from both sides to work, and sometimes that effort wasn\u2019t quite equal. Right now, Dan needed to put in a little more effort, and that was okay. He could do it. He <i>wanted</i> to do it. He wanted to fight for this beautiful, incredible, amazing thing in his life. </p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll get through this, alright? You don\u2019t have to worry; I\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201d </p><p>Phil\u2019s frame relaxed at Dan\u2019s words, and relief oozed from him. He let his hand cup Dan\u2019s head and gently pulled him into a kiss. </p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d </p>",

Dan had taken three days to destruct during the week that Phil had been away, and all 72 hours were pure hell. And after Dan managed to pull himself from his sheets enough to try and be a person, Dan threw himself into his work. When he needed some sort of explanation for his behavior, he had used the flimsy excuse of needing to make up for the three work shifts he missed. </p><p>They had both asked after him during those three days where he disappeared with no explanation, and when Dan only returned horribly drawn into himself and not acting normal, they had grown even more concerned. Dan couldn&rsquo;t remember when he had last received so many texts in such a short time. </p><p>When Phil had initially gotten back it was late at night, and even though Dan had been awake when Phil had texted him, he hadn&rsquo;t responded. The next day Phil had called him, telling Dan that he had a <i>loonngg</i> shift at the weather station. However, he still wanted to try and see Dan because it had been ages since they had last had some down time together. </p><p>Dan had nearly bitten his tongue off to keep himself from dropping a damaging, smartass comment about how little he had seen of his boyfriend and that spending this much time apart was basically normal. </p><p>He knew that Phil was trying. He didn&rsquo;t deserve something like that. </p><p>It was Dan, however, to shut down the possibility of them meeting that day. Dan still wasn&rsquo;t feeling normal, and he knew that he looked like a hot, depressed mess. He not only didn&rsquo;t want Phil to see him like this, but he also didn&rsquo;t want to have to try and pretend. Dan knew that if they saw each other their time would be extremely limited between both of their work schedules that day, and Dan was <i>well</i> aware of how not okay he was. If he saw Phil he would act even less normal because of all of the reasons why Dan was hurting inside, and they didn&rsquo;t have the time right now to try and work through it all. </p><p>So even though it cut something inside of him to hear the fall of Phil&rsquo;s voice at Dan&rsquo;s rejection, Dan stood by his decision. </p><p>That shift seemed extra long, and it wasn&rsquo;t because Dan was working a double. </p><p>The next day Dan gave Phil a similar reason. The third one&mdash;the day they finally saw each other&mdash;was only the fateful day because Phil had shown up to Dan&rsquo;s door. Dan had opened it, not really knowing who would be behind the door, but he had been puzzled to find Phil standing there. He was a bit disheveled and his eyebrows drawn together in concern; the lines those eyebrows made only grew deeper the moment that Phil saw Dan. </p><p>When he saw Phil, a part of Dan that he wasn&rsquo;t proud of wanted to find any excuse he could to run or hide because he didn&rsquo;t feel anywhere close to being able to handle this. Instead, he only opened the door wide enough for Phil to pass through, and led him into the lounge where they stood, five feet apart physically and even more in every other way that mattered. </p><p>Dan resisted the urge to squirm as Phil raked his eyes over Dan&rsquo;s frame. Dan had no doubts that he noticed the rumpled clothes, messy hair, his slightly thinner frame from not properly eating, and the deep eye bags from a lack of sleep. </p><p>&ldquo;Dan&hellip;&rdquo; Phil breathed, like it was the only word he could manage. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;What are you apologizing for?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Pulling away from you when you got back. I know I shouldn&rsquo;t have shut you out like that, and I know you wanted to see me. I wanted to see you too, but just&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Just?&rdquo; Phil asked after Dan trailed off and didn&rsquo;t continue his sentence. </p><p>&ldquo;&hellip;not like <i>this</i>.&rdquo; </p><p>Phil&rsquo;s face softened, and he took a few steps forward to close the physical distance between them. He took Dan&rsquo;s hand into his after a moment. </p><p>&ldquo;Dan, there won&rsquo;t ever be a time when I don&rsquo;t want to see you. And when you&rsquo;re in a bad place I only want to be here more to help you.&rdquo; </p><p>Dan looked down. </p><p><i>You say this now. You don&rsquo;t know how bad it gets. </i></p><p>&ldquo;This has to do with you going M.I.A. last week, doesn&rsquo;t it? Dan,&rdquo; Phil said, his voice soft as can be, &ldquo;what happened to you while I was gone? I want to help, but&hellip;but you need to let me in.&rdquo; </p><p>Two sides in a bitter war rapidly formed in Dan&rsquo;s head. One was melting at Phil&rsquo;s words and swelling with the notion that Phil cared about him this much. The other was taking advantage of Dan&rsquo;s post-depressive-episode emotional state and rising with a terrible anger at Phil trying to talk about letting people in. Dan wasn&rsquo;t proud at how fast that darker side of him took over. </p><p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t really talk about letting people in when all you&rsquo;ve been doing for the past month is shutting me out.&rdquo; Dan bit back before he could even try and control his words. His hand slipped out of Phil&rsquo;s, and the part of Dan that didn&rsquo;t want to get angry screamed that this was going to manifest into one of Dan&rsquo;s many regrets if Dan kept acting like an asshole. </p><p>Phil looked confused for half of a second, but his expression immediately became guilty. </p><p>&ldquo;Dan, I know we haven&rsquo;t been spending a lot of time together lately, but it&rsquo;s just been work stuff, and I-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, like how over a month ago whatever the hell you had on your phone was only a change in schedule? Yeah, no offense but I&rsquo;m calling bullshit.&rdquo; </p><p>Dan had no idea where he was getting the anger or the energy for this. He had been so, so drained this whole week, and now his body decided to kick into high gear?</p><p>Phil&rsquo;s eyebrows crinkled once again, but this wasn&rsquo;t him being concerned. This was him stifling his anger. For some reason, that only made Dan madder. </p><p>&ldquo;What are you talking about?&rdquo; </p><p>Dan laughed. &ldquo;What am I talking about? Do you remember that movie night we had, and I took care of our trash. When I came back in you were on your phone, reading <i>something</i>, but you were so upset. You looked like you were going to throw your phone&mdash;and I&rsquo;m sorry I was concerned about you&mdash;but I asked you what was up, and you <i>lied</i> to me.&rdquo; </p><p>Phil huffed, and Dan watched agitation blossom in his eyes. </p><p>&ldquo;What, should I come to you whenever I get any notification now? Dan, that&rsquo;s like, three red flags of what should <i>not</i> be in a relationship.&rdquo; </p><p>Dan ran his hands through his hair, groaning. </p><p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t care what the <i>hell</i> you get on your phone. What I care about is that you fucking lied to my fucking face! That&rsquo;s the kind of shit my parents pulled all the damn time, and <i>fuck</i>, I can&rsquo;t <i>stand</i> when people fucking lie to me!&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Is this why you look like you&rsquo;ve been through the war? Have you been upset about this this whole time? I mean, Dan, I never meant-&rdquo; </p><p>Dan knew that this anger was his hyperactive depression taking the wheel and trying it&rsquo;s hardest to fuck up anything good in his life, but he felt powerless to stop it. He was spitting out words faster than his brain could try and regulate them. </p><p>&ldquo;Uh, yeah, I&rsquo;ve been sitting here for the past month trying to figure out why the <i>hell</i> my boyfriend lied to me and feels that he can&rsquo;t fucking trust me, but if you think that it&rsquo;s the <i>only</i> reason that I look like fucking shit then you are <i>sorely</i> wrong.&rdquo; Dan took a step forward, some sort of dam inside of him having been smashed to smithereens. &ldquo;I spent the the first two weeks of this year wondering why you were only pulling further and further away from me. I barely saw you, and when I did, it was for such a little amount of time. You dropped everything once your phone rang, but you didn&rsquo;t even bother to answer <i>half</i> of my texts.&rdquo; </p><p>Dan turned away and started to pace. He needed a way to get rid of all of this sudden energy that he had. </p><p>&ldquo;I spent the whole week before you left slipping into depression, and slowly getting stuck inside my head.&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;You could have told me, I-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t even <i>try</i> and put this on me because you also could have done a lot too. And can you really blame me for thinking that you didn&rsquo;t want me to bother you? It&rsquo;s not like you seemed like you wanted anything to do with <i>me</i>.&rdquo; </p><p>Phil recoiled like he had been physically hit with Dan&rsquo;s words. </p><p>&ldquo;And when you left, <i>god</i>, it was just in time for me to fall apart completely. I spent<i> three fucking days</i> in bed thinking about how lonely I am and how the only two people in this world that I care about are moving on without me and how I&rsquo;m going to end up <i>alone</i>. And Phil that&rsquo;s not your fault, but the reason why I look like I&rsquo;ve been through the war is because I fucking <i>have</i> been. You don&rsquo;t get to try and berate me for pushing you out when that&rsquo;s <i>all</i> you&rsquo;ve been doing to me for the past fucking <i>month</i>.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan took a breath, clenching his fists and blew out the air in his lungs shakily. </p><p><i>God, I really need to calm the fuck down&hellip;</i></p><p>A minute passed in complete silence while Dan gathered himself and tried to dampen the flames of anger inside of him. </p><p>When he started talking again, his voice was at a normal volume. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been hurting <i>so</i> bad. I know I could have told you, but you also could have noticed. I&rsquo;m upset that you lied to me. I&rsquo;m upset that you shut me out and flat out ignored me at times. I&rsquo;m upset that you didn&rsquo;t feel like you could trust me. I know I should have told you sooner, but I didn&rsquo;t want to spoil the holidays, and then you slipped away from me so quickly. I haven&rsquo;t exactly had the chance, and I&rsquo;m sorry I let it blow up to this. I&rsquo;m really sorry I just like, <i>screamed</i> at you, but <i>fuck</i>, it felt good to let it all out.&rdquo; </p><p>Dan slumped against his couch. The anger that had engulfed him had been sudden and complete, and it was gone as fast as it had arrived. </p><p>It was quiet for a moment&hellip;five&hellip;ten&hellip;</p><p>&ldquo;The station isn&rsquo;t getting enough views anymore, and they can&rsquo;t keep losing money. The owners are dissolving the company to cut their losses, and the last broadcast is at the end of the month. I knew the owners really well so they&rsquo;ve endorsed me to a few other stations, but none of them would be based around here, and I&rsquo;d have to move.&rdquo; Phil said, quietly, his gaze on his feet. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been trying all of the other local weather stations to try and get a job, but none of them are hiring, even after calling in some favors and dropping a few names. I didn&rsquo;t want to tell you until I knew what I was doing.&rdquo; </p><p>Dan&rsquo;s jaw dropped at the words, horror seeping into his bones. </p><p>&ldquo;I&hellip;&rdquo; Dan trailed off, not even knowing where to start. The attention to his phone, the never-ending phone calls, the constant long hours and appointments, they all fell into place and made much more sense than any half-baked explanation Dan had tried to come up with. </p><p>And <i>god</i> did Dan feel guilty. Phil had been dealing with all of this for so long, and he had undoubtedly been anxious and stressed over it, and what had Dan done? He had gotten worked up over the fact that he was missing a bit of attention, let it fuck with his head, and he had just fucking exploded at Phil for no good reason. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so fucking sorry,&rdquo; Dan breathed, and his voice sounded guilty, tight, and overwhelmed, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know, and I shouldn&rsquo;t have-&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;<i>Exactly</i>, Dan, that&rsquo;s exactly my point.&rdquo; Phil interrupted, tangling his fingers through Dan&rsquo;s. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t tell you because I was scared and selfish and I didn&rsquo;t want to admit that something like this was happening. I didn&rsquo;t think about how this would affect you, and now that my head isn&rsquo;t up my own arse <i>I&rsquo;m</i> sorry that I put you through that. I&rsquo;m sorry I lied to you, and I&rsquo;m sorry I kept pulling away from you.&rdquo; Phil laughed a little. &ldquo;I was so worried about protecting you from the stress I was going through that I didn&rsquo;t even see how my actions were affecting you.&rdquo; </p><p>They both fell quiet, and that silent moment with nothing but Phil&rsquo;s thumb rolling over Dan&rsquo;s knuckles was exactly what Dan needed to collect himself. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry I yelled at you. I know I already said that, but even if you were a bit of a jerk you didn&rsquo;t deserve it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I kind of did.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, you really didn&rsquo;t. Normally I&rsquo;m better at handling things like that, but I guess I&rsquo;m worn pretty thin to the bone right now. It&rsquo;s no excuse, but&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Phil squeezed his hand. </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s alright. I promise I won&rsquo;t ever try and keep something like this from you. I learned my lesson, trust me.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Can I ask you something?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Sure.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;If the station is going under, why did they send you to that old guy? I would have thought that they would try and keep all the money they could.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Normally, yeah. The owners and I know each other really well though. They&rsquo;re friends of my parents and I grew up around them. When it was clear that the station wasn&rsquo;t going to survive, they wanted to give me all they could for me to make it somewhere else as a meteorologist. So they convinced their old colleague to mentor me for a week.&rdquo; </p><p>Dan hummed in response, thinking. There was one other question he wanted to ask, but he was afraid of the answer. </p><p>He decided to ask it anyways. </p><p>Being afraid had been what had gotten them into this mess in the first place. </p><p>&ldquo;Have you decided where you want to go yet?&rdquo; </p><p>Phil sighed, his shoulders sagging under an invisible weight. </p><p>&ldquo;No. The few places I was recommended to are too far for me to commute to, like I said, and I tried every local station I could.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;So what are you thinking of doing?&rdquo; </p><p>Phil bit his lip. </p><p>&ldquo;Nothing I guess. Keep trying, maybe hope that a local station gets an opening, but other than that&hellip;I don&rsquo;t think I can really do that much.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Wait a minute, Phil, you&rsquo;re just giving up? You can&rsquo;t do that, meteorology is your dream! You have a freaking degree in it, you&rsquo;ve worked so hard to get where you are, and you&rsquo;re just going to throw it out the window?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think I know that? I just&hellip;&rdquo; Phil squeezed Dan&rsquo;s hand, and Dan&rsquo;s eye widened as he caught all of the words Phil was trying to convey to him without speaking. </p><p>&ldquo;Phil, you can&rsquo;t give up on your dream just because of me.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;m <i>giving up</i> on it, more like&hellip;pressing pause?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Phil.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Okay, fine, you caught me, I&rsquo;m not pursuing any of the other stations in the cities because I&rsquo;d have to move away from you, and I don&rsquo;t think I could do that.&rdquo; </p><p>Dan pulled Phil down with him onto the couch. They instinctively curled around each other, each of their bodies bending in the direction of the other. </p><p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t sacrifice your career for me. I won&rsquo;t let you.&rdquo; </p><p>Phil only continued to play with Dan&rsquo;s hand in his, not quite ignoring Dan&rsquo;s gaze, but not meeting it either. </p><p>&ldquo;Phil.&rdquo; </p><p>He looked up, and Dan tried to smile to reassure him. </p><p>&ldquo;Listen, if you want to pursue your dream of being a top meteorologist, then I&rsquo;ll stand by you, even if that means that you have to move across the country. You&rsquo;re special to me, Philip Lester, and I&rsquo;m willing to sacrifice a little cuddle time to see you happy and doing what you love. Besides, we can always visit each other.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Dan, we both know you can&rsquo;t really afford a lot of trips places, especially if they&rsquo;re far.&rdquo; </p><p>Dan shrugged. </p><p>&ldquo;A few doubles never hurt anyone.\"&nbsp;</p><p>\"Dan, you already work way too much, there&rsquo;s no way I&rsquo;m letting you work <i>more</i> just for me.\"&nbsp;</p><p>\"Shhh,&rdquo; Dan interrupted. The stress of trying to come up with the money to visit Phil regularly would bear down on him later, but Dan didn&rsquo;t want to think about it right now. Right now he was so, so <i>fond</i> of this man in front of him. This man who knew that something like this would stress Dan out of his mind, and tried&mdash;even if he went about it the wrong way&mdash;to relieve that stress. </p><p>Relationships needed effort from both sides to work, and sometimes that effort wasn&rsquo;t quite equal. Right now, Dan needed to put in a little more effort, and that was okay. He could do it. He <i>wanted</i> to do it. He wanted to fight for this beautiful, incredible, amazing thing in his life. </p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get through this, alright? You don&rsquo;t have to worry; I&rsquo;m not going anywhere.&rdquo; </p><p>Phil&rsquo;s frame relaxed at Dan&rsquo;s words, and relief oozed from him. He let his hand cup Dan&rsquo;s head and gently pulled him into a kiss. </p><p>&ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo; </p>",
