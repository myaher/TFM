I\u2019ve seen just about every breakdown video suggested and as a fangirl/fanfic writer, the most randomest line can spark an idea.\u00a0</p><p>So headcanon that Loki many Earth years ago mated with a woman(or if ya wanna get more mythological, Loki could have been the mom cos ya know&hellip;shape shifting, and mated with a man.) and was an ancestor for the Stark line&hellip;Loki\u2019s Jotunn blood in Tony is part of what helped him survive in Siberia.\u00a0</p><p>For a darker and sadder fanfic idea that I might try out later&hellip;like someone on Team Cap is spying on Tony as he\u2019s alone in this cold climate location. Maybe it\u2019s Scott and he\u2019s down in ant size, reporting back. There are wolves nearby and Scott\u2019s thinking that Tony\u2019s wanting to go all Stark and create IronDireWolves (which would be totally cool). These are wild and dangerous animals and Tony\u2019s there alone, his mask is lifted and his face is unreadable. Next thing he does he steps out of his armor, Scott\u2019s confused because the wolf is now a wolf pack and getting closer. What the hell is Stark thinking? Does he have some sort of new weapon he wants to test out on wolves? Is he meeting with someone else before the wolves arrive? But no.

        "answer": "<p>wow, that's\u00a0mean, but I respect it.\u00a0</p><p>do you mean emotional or physical pain? How about both!</p><p>-He was about 7 during iron man 1 so imagine that kind of pain. He had only been with Aunt May and Uncle Ben for a year and they panicked and took him to the hospital. There was nothing physically wrong with him so the doctors decided that it was his soul connection.\u00a0</p><p>-Ever since the initial violent chest pain, he had been sick until he was about 9-10. Then everything was fine, he was constantly in very minor pain but he could handle it and he never told Ben or May.\u00a0</p><p>-Then the events of the Avengers. Peter got bruises from nowhere and would bleed a little and felt a little sad at one point. But it was during the alien invasion that it got bad. Peter watched the TV as Iron Man flew into the portal. He mistook Tony\u2019s fear with his own and almost broke down crying. After that, he had been afraid of space and aliens. He slowly got to the point where he could watch Star Wars and it became his favorite franchise. duh.\u00a0</p><p>-During when everyone thought that Tony was dead, Peter felt brief bouts of debilitating terror and intense cold even though he was indoors and had the heat on.\u00a0</p><p>-Tony felt when Peter got bullied, he got bruises and had the breath knocked out of him on multiple occasions but never knew why. he had grown up not thinking that he had a soul connection.\u00a0</p><p>-Before Ultron, Tony felt a painful sting on the back of his neck and got violently sick for a few days after that. Only weeks later he was hit with longlasting violent\u00a0sadness that reminded him of how he felt when his parents died but somehow worse. He could distinctly feel like his hands were warm and wet despite them being completely dry.\u00a0</p><p>-During and after Ultron, Peter and Tony\u2019s combined guilt was a violent pain on its own, They both felt both the guilt of not being able to save Ben and being manipulated into making a murderbot. So that sucked.\u00a0</p><p>-Guilt felt like the only emotion that either of them could feel. Until they met during civil war. Peter\u2019s excitement bled into Tony\u2019s fear and they evened each other\u00a0out a little.\u00a0</p><p>-Neither of them figured it out while they were around each other\u00a0though. Genius who</p><p>-Peter almost accidentally\u00a0killed someone when Tony found out that his parents were murdered. The rage and betrayal made him force himself out of being Spider-Man for the rest of the day because he was afraid about what would happen if he lost control.\u00a0</p><p>-Tony realized that their souls were connected when he took away Peter\u2019s suit. He felt so strongly that he had disappointed someone important to him that he had to stop himself from tearing up. He knew, but he didn\u2019t tell Peter.\u00a0</p><p>-Now Tony knew why on one night he felt traumatizing fear for almost ten minutes before violent pain erupted throughout his body and he felt like he was being crushed. He couldn\u2019t breathe and he gasped for air while he tried to look on security cameras for Peter. He really regretted taking away the kids suit and Peter\u2019s overwhelming fear bled into him and he could barely act.\u00a0</p><p>-when he could breathe again, he could still tell that Peter hadn\u2019t gone home. He felt cold winds and like he was falling before burning heat and sharp pains as Peter was battling the vulture.\u00a0</p><p>-He gave the suit back as soon as he could\u00a0</p><p>-Between the vulture and infinity war, it wasn\u2019t too bad. Peter still didn\u2019t know that his soul was connected to Tony\u2019s but he would find out soon.\u00a0</p><p>-He swore that he had a mini heart attack when Thanos wrapped his hand around the kid&rsquo;s throat and not just because he could feel it\u00a0</p><p>-He could almost hear Peters pitched gasp from far away when Tony had been stabbed with his own nano-sword\u00a0</p><p>-Thanos definitely did\u00a0</p><p>-Doctor Strange did, or at least that must\u2019ve been the reason that he saved Tony. To save the kid from the pain.\u00a0</p><p>-It didn\u2019t do any good</p><p>-Tony felt a sudden pulse of anxiety even before people started to disappear, later he knew that it was because Peter knew. Peter\u2019s stupid power warned him beforehand that he would be a casualty</p><p>-Tony was filled with dread that he couldn\u2019t identify as his own or Peters as one by one, the guardians turned into dust. He could feel Peter\u2019s molecules tear themselves apart and try to heal themselves back.\u00a0</p><p>-He felt Peter accept it, and he felt Peter fade. and he didn\u2019t have the chance to tell him that he knew about their souls being connected, however it should\u2019ve been obvious by then.</p><p>-Tony was terrified to figure out what he would feel when Peter was gone.

There was nothing physically wrong with him so the doctors decided that it was his soul connection.&nbsp;</p><p>-Ever since the initial violent chest pain, he had been sick until he was about 9-10. Then everything was fine, he was constantly in very minor pain but he could handle it and he never told Ben or May.&nbsp;</p><p>-Then the events of the Avengers. Peter got bruises from nowhere and would bleed a little and felt a little sad at one point. But it was during the alien invasion that it got bad. Peter watched the TV as Iron Man flew into the portal. He mistook Tony&rsquo;s fear with his own and almost broke down crying. After that, he had been afraid of space and aliens.
