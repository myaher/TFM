Both Aziraphale and Crowley make repeated\u00a0\u2018efforts\u2019 to not only assimilate into human society but to specifically exist in the socially constructed genders of the society in which they live. More specifically they exist, live, and experience the world as men and that conscious choice should be acknowledged and respected by readers.\u00a0</p><p>I could just says\u00a0\u2018in this essay I will\u2019 and leave it, but this is important to me and I actually am going to write this essay so, in this essay I will argue that both Aziraphale and Crowley make an effort to be gendered and should be considered men and more specifically, in the language of 2019, should be considered trans men.\u00a0</p><!-- more --><p><b><i>[edited: read the extended, expanded version of this essay <a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/17937731\">here</a>!]</i></b></p><p>Gender is socially constructed, it\u2019s not an innate quality of a person, it requires an effort by <i>everyone</i>, cis, trans, and otherwise. Within a society gender exists as a complex set of rules and subtleties that are either followed or broken, performed or subverted by the individuals within that society, it requires all members of a society to make an effort. When we gender, or transgender, or ungender ourselves we are all making an effort, through our clothes, through our bodies, through our actions, etc, they\u2019re all efforts in a particular direction.</p><p>&ldquo;For those of angel stock or demon breed, size, and shape, and composition are merely options.\u201d Aziraphale and Crowley are both full capable to altering their physical forms, their male forms are a conscious choice on their part and they have gendered their appearances and their actions enough that people around them see them and refer to them as men (and in Aziraphale\u2019s case, a gay man). These male bodies are the bodies that they <i>want </i>to exist in.</p><p>Crowley\u2019s narration explicitly calls his human male form his favorite shape after he changed into \u2018something dreadful\u2019 to scare one of the paintballers. Not only that but he says to Aziraphale that he hates doing that because he\u2019s always afraid he\u2019s going to forget how to change back. His form as it is, ie a man, is exceptionally important him and being taken out of it is a source of anxiety for him.</p><p>While Aziraphale\u2019s relationship with his gender is more internalized than Crowley\u2019s, his actions speak to the same end. Like Crowley, his physical form is a conscious choice, they can look like and be any gender and they still choose to be men.\u00a0</p><p>Angels were created wholly outside current concepts of gender and sex, they don\u2019t don\u2019t have a gender or sex and they don\u2019t <i>not </i>have one. It\u2019s difficult to conceptualize this because gender is so ingrained in our culture, but it\u2019s not for angels (or Fallen angels for that matter). Religious writing generally make reference to angels taking the form of humans in an illusionary context when they speak to people. But Aziraphale clearly goes beyond that; he has chosen to <i>exist </i>as a (gay) man. He\u2019s a man when he\u2019s interacting with humans, he\u2019s a man when he\u2019s hanging out in the back room just with Crowley, and he doesn\u2019t change anything when he\u2019s sitting alone, reading, and gathering dust. He never drops any illusion, he never stops being a man. (And this I think is a difficult thing for cis people to understand, even when I\u2019m alone in my room with no one else, I am still, in a way, consciously aware of, and performing my gender, even though there\u2019s no one to perform to because it\u2019s still something that I <i>have </i>to do.)</p><p>It is also extremely significant that everyone who meets Aziraphale assumes that he is a gay man, technically two separate assumptions that, while correct about him today, were not technically correct yet at that the moment of his creation. It\u2019s correct now because Aziraphale\u2019s sense of identity has changed and he\u2019s making an effort to make it correct.\u00a0</p><p>Aziraphale\u2019s masculinity is indivisible from his queerness, which is to say his identity is not just A Man but A <i>Gay </i>Man specifically. The masculinity which he has created for himself, which he performs and inhabits, is a queer one.\u00a0</p><p>His masculine identity is not what is is typically considered traditionally masculine for the culture. Shadwell describes him as soft, his hands are elegant and manicured (in <i>1990</i>), he freely touches other men (again in <i>1990 </i>which was a very different time) several of the homophobic insults used against him specifically invoke concepts on effeminacy. He doesn\u2019t just default to a stereotypical masculine existence, he constructs his own masculinity based on what\u2019s important to his concept of his own masculine identity. It\u2019s a choice. And it\u2019s a choice that stands in defiance of what society says, and what would be easier, and that makes it all the more significant.</p><p>He is both aware and proud of his queer masculine identity. He is aware of how humans perceive him and leans into that both individually and in collaboration with Crowley (<a href=\"http://irisbleufic.tumblr.com/post/182718412595/trans-aziraphale-irisbleufic-irisbleufic\">as AJ and I recently discussed</a>) because that\u2019s who he <i>is</i>.\u00a0He doesn\u2019t change the way he performs his masculinity because of the way it\u2019s perceived even though it would likely make his life easier (or at least, make humans less rude towards him). His queer masculinity is important to him.\u00a0</p><p>Four different slurs and insults used for gay men specifically are used against Aziraphale in the text, either for the way he dresses, the way he behaves, or the way he speaks. He is aware that these words are used against him (he\u2019s not just A Southern Pansy, he\u2019s THE Southern Pansy) and aware of the meaning and cruelness behind them (while he easily brushes off Warlock\u2019s heckling of his magic, after one of Warlock\u2019s friends calls him a f****t he decides that Warlock is\u00a0\u2018obviously infernally tainted\u2019).</p><p>He is comfortable and proud of his identity as a gay man and proudly reclaims the insults people have used against him. His identity as a gay man is important to him, it <i>matters, </i>so much so that he does indeed \u2018make an effort\u2019, he <i>is </i>a man, and his identity should be acknowledged and respected as should Crowley\u2019s.\u00a0</p><p>(Several people have felt the need to comment on a previous post that\u00a0\u2018sexless\u2019 should be read as a euphemism for\u00a0\u2018without genitalia\u2019. While the original intention of the line cannot be inferred by the text, it should be pointed out that if that was what was meant, that doesn\u2019t actually change the above points. If the bodies Crowley and Aziraphale have are indeed lacking genitalia, they\u2019re still making an effort to be exist as, and be seen as men. A man without a penis is still a man and when they make that effort to exist as and be seen as men their gender should be acknowledged and the same acknowledgement should be extended to Aziraphale and Crowley.)\u00a0</p>",

Within a society gender exists as a complex set of rules and subtleties that are either followed or broken, performed or subverted by the individuals within that society, it requires all members of a society to make an effort. When we gender, or transgender, or ungender ourselves we are all making an effort, through our clothes, through our bodies, through our actions, etc, they\u2019re all efforts in a particular direction.</p><p>\u201cFor those of angel stock or demon breed, size, and shape, and composition are merely options.\u201d Aziraphale and Crowley are both full capable to altering their physical forms, their male forms are a conscious choice on their part and they have gendered their appearances and their actions enough that people around them see them and refer to them as men (and in Aziraphale\u2019s case, a gay man). These male bodies are the bodies that they <i>want </i>to exist in.</p><p>Crowley\u2019s narration explicitly calls his human male form his favorite shape after he changed into \u2018something dreadful\u2019 to scare one of the paintballers. Not only that but he says to Aziraphale that he hates doing that because he\u2019s always afraid he\u2019s going to forget how to change back. His form as it is, ie a man, is exceptionally important him and being taken out of it is a source of anxiety for him.</p><p>While Aziraphale\u2019s relationship with his gender is more internalized than Crowley\u2019s, his actions speak to the same end. Like Crowley, his physical form is a conscious choice, they can look like and be any gender and they still choose to be men.\u00a0</p><p>Angels were created wholly outside current concepts of gender and sex, they don\u2019t don\u2019t have a gender or sex and they don\u2019t <i>not </i>have one. It\u2019s difficult to conceptualize this because gender is so ingrained in our culture, but it\u2019s not for angels (or Fallen angels for that matter). Religious writing generally make reference to angels taking the form of humans in an illusionary context when they speak to people. But Aziraphale clearly goes beyond that; he has chosen to <i>exist </i>as a (gay) man. He\u2019s a man when he\u2019s interacting with humans, he\u2019s a man when he\u2019s hanging out in the back room just with Crowley, and he doesn\u2019t change anything when he\u2019s sitting alone, reading, and gathering dust. He never drops any illusion, he never stops being a man. (And this I think is a difficult thing for cis people to understand, even when I\u2019m alone in my room with no one else, I am still, in a way, consciously aware of, and performing my gender, even though there\u2019s no one to perform to because it\u2019s still something that I <i>have </i>to do.)</p><p>It is also extremely significant that everyone who meets Aziraphale assumes that he is a gay man, technically two separate assumptions that, while correct about him today, were not technically correct yet at that the moment of his creation. It\u2019s correct now because Aziraphale\u2019s sense of identity has changed and he\u2019s making an effort to make it correct.\u00a0</p><p>Aziraphale\u2019s masculinity is indivisible from his queerness, which is to say his identity is not just A Man but A <i>Gay </i>Man specifically. The masculinity which he has created for himself, which he performs and inhabits, is a queer one.\u00a0</p><p>His masculine identity is not what is is typically considered traditionally masculine for the culture. Shadwell describes him as soft, his hands are elegant and manicured (in <i>1990</i>), he freely touches other men (again in <i>1990 </i>which was a very different time) several of the homophobic insults used against him specifically invoke concepts on effeminacy. He doesn\u2019t just default to a stereotypical masculine existence, he constructs his own masculinity based on what\u2019s important to his concept of his own masculine identity. It\u2019s a choice. And it\u2019s a choice that stands in defiance of what society says, and what would be easier, and that makes it all the more significant.</p><p>He is both aware and proud of his queer masculine identity. He is aware of how humans perceive him and leans into that both individually and in collaboration with Crowley (<a href=\"http://irisbleufic.tumblr.com/post/182718412595/trans-aziraphale-irisbleufic-irisbleufic\">as AJ and I recently discussed</a>) because that\u2019s who he <i>is</i>.\u00a0He doesn\u2019t change the way he performs his masculinity because of the way it\u2019s perceived even though it would likely make his life easier (or at least, make humans less rude towards him). His queer masculinity is important to him.\u00a0</p><p>Four different slurs and insults used for gay men specifically are used against Aziraphale in the text, either for the way he dresses, the way he behaves, or the way he speaks. He is aware that these words are used against him (he\u2019s not just A Southern Pansy, he\u2019s THE Southern Pansy) and aware of the meaning and cruelness behind them (while he easily brushes off Warlock\u2019s heckling of his magic, after one of Warlock\u2019s friends calls him a f****t he decides that Warlock is\u00a0\u2018obviously infernally tainted\u2019).</p><p>He is comfortable and proud of his identity as a gay man and proudly reclaims the insults people have used against him. His identity as a gay man is important to him, it <i>matters, </i>so much so that he does indeed \u2018make an effort\u2019, he <i>is </i>a man, and his identity should be acknowledged and respected as should Crowley\u2019s.\u00a0</p><p>(Several people have felt the need to comment on a previous post that\u00a0\u2018sexless\u2019 should be read as a euphemism for\u00a0\u2018without genitalia\u2019. While the original intention of the line cannot be inferred by the text, it should be pointed out that if that was what was meant, that doesn\u2019t actually change the above points. If the bodies Crowley and Aziraphale have are indeed lacking genitalia, they\u2019re still making an effort to be exist as, and be seen as men. A man without a penis is still a man and when they make that effort to exist as and be seen as men their gender should be acknowledged and the same acknowledgement should be extended to Aziraphale and Crowley.)\u00a0</p>",
