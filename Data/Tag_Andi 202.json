His stepmother, also his therapist, said it was low self esteem, a byproduct of bad social anxiety and surely someone would sit by him. A part of him wanted it to be the boy lingering outside resting his arm against the wall. Cyrus recognized the boy from somewhere. His parents were probably famous. </p><p>Cyrus knew it was rude to stare, but the boy looked so alone. </p><p>Staring at him won\u2019t make him feel any better, Cyrus muttered to himself. He would count to three and on three he would invite the boy in. </p><p>\u201cOne\u2026. two\u2026\u201d The boy moved away. Cyrus\u2019s eyes followed the boy\u2019s movements down the hall. Cyrus pondered following him, but he doubted that would make a good first impression. So, Cyrus waited inside, hoping someone would say hi to him. </p><p>He knew that house meant family, but he was really hoping to make a friend before the sorting ceremony. </p><p>He quickly spotted a girl with her head down.

So your friend locked you out of your own cabin, huh?\u201d </p><p>Cyrus nodded. </p><p>\u201cWell, are you gonna ask to come back in or are you just gonna chill with me until we get to Hogwarts?\u201d </p><p>Cyrus debated whether or not to accept TJ\u2019s offer\u2026 if it was even an offer.

The food cart lady doesn\u2019t like \u2018loiters\u2019.\u201d </p><p>Cyrus laughed. TJ began walking towards a cabin as Cyrus said a quiet thank you to Andi, not that they could hear.

My sister\u2019s in here with some girl, but there are still open spots.\u201d </p><p>\u201cCool!\u201d Cyrus called out, hurrying to catch up with TJ. </p><p>Cyrus reached the cabin and peeked his heard in. \u201cI\u2019m Cyrus.

He turned the knob, opening the door a crack before racing back to his seat. </p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He sat down. </p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean you can\u2019t?\u201d Andi asked, confused. </p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s\u2026 I uh\u2026 I can\u2019t.\u201d </p><p>\u201cSure, you can.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI really can\u2019t right now, Andi. Maybe he\u2019ll be in my house and then I\u2019ll work up to talking to him.and then i\u2019ll cross that bridge when i get to him.\u201d </p><p>\u201cHaving a conversation won\u2019t mean you\u2019re dating.\u201d </p><p>Cyrus blushed. \u201cBUT BOY CUTE. I WANT TO DATE BOY.\u201d </p><p>He said it a little too loudly. TJ turned to look at the cabin heard on and thus to look at Cyrus. </p><p>\u201cI forgot to close the door. The door is open. Boy head what I said,\u201d Cyrus started to ramble. </p><p>Andi recognize what Cyrus was doing. \u201cTell me five things you see,\u201d Andi insisted. </p><p>\u201cUm, you. The window. The boy. The decently concerning shakiness of the wood in the floor. The reddish carpet of the seat. Smoke coming from the engine of this train,\u201d Cyrus said, feeling his heart slow down. </p><p>\u201cOk,\u201d Andi said, getting up from the red seat. She pulled Cyrus up from his seat and pushed him towards the door. Andi quickly opened the door and shoved Cyrus into the hall. </p><p>\u201cGo get him, Cyrus,\u201d Andi said, impulsively. </p><p>Cyrus didn\u2019t understand what was happening until it was too late. </p><p>The door shut behind him, and he had a feeling that Andi locked it. </p><p>Here goes, he said to himself. </p><p>He walked up to TJ. \u201cHi,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m Cyrus.\u201d </p><p>TJ looked at him. \u201cYou like boys huh?\u201d </p><p>Cyrus nodded nervously. \u201cYeah, I would\u2019ve phrased it more um less chaotic. But yeah, boys are what I like. I like boys.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou think I\u2019m cute?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019d say that I didn\u2019t say that\u2026 but I know for a fact that you heard me\u2026 so yes, I think you\u2019re cute. I like your jacket. Where\u2019d you get it?\u201d </p><p>\u201cSlow your roll, cyrus. Amber, my sister, picked it out for my last birthday. I don\u2019t know where she got it. So your friend locked you out of your own cabin, huh?\u201d </p><p>Cyrus nodded. </p><p>\u201cWell, are you gonna ask to come back in or are you just gonna chill with me until we get to Hogwarts?\u201d </p><p>Cyrus debated whether or not to accept TJ\u2019s offer\u2026 if it was even an offer. He wasn\u2019t quite sure how to differentiate between sarcasm or genuine honesty. But he was working on it. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll chill with you, if that\u2019s alright.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, sure. Cyrus. Come on, we should probably find a cabin. The food cart lady doesn\u2019t like \u2018loiters\u2019.\u201d </p><p>Cyrus laughed. TJ began walking towards a cabin as Cyrus said a quiet thank you to Andi, not that they could hear. Then, they followed TJ down the hall. </p><p>\u201cHere it is. My sister\u2019s in here with some girl, but there are still open spots.\u201d </p><p>\u201cCool!\u201d Cyrus called out, hurrying to catch up with TJ. </p><p>Cyrus reached the cabin and peeked his heard in. \u201cI\u2019m Cyrus. Who are you two?\u201d </p><p>\u201cAmber, TJ\u2019s sister,\u201d said the blonde. </p><p>\u201cBuffy, I\u2019m a runner. And hopefully a gryffindor. But who knows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCyrus. Hufflepuff, hopefully.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell come on in. TJ hasn\u2019t scared you off, has he?\u201d Amber asked as Cyrus found a seat. </p><p>\u201cWhy would you think that?\u201d Cyrus asked. </p><p>Amber pulled lip gloss out of her pocket and started to fiddle with the cap. \u201cReasons.\u201d </p><p>Cyrus didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or be concerned. </p><p>This vibe remained in the cabin. A slight one edge feeling, no one tried to subdue it or change it. They rode like that, making conversation every now and then as a group once in a while. But they mainly stayed in two people conversations. TJ and Cyrus. Amber and Buffy. Buffy and Cyrus. TJ and Amber bickering. </p>",
                "content": "<p>Cyrus waited patiently in the train cabin. He didn&rsquo;t know that many people, and the people he knew surely had other friends. His stepmother, also his therapist, said it was low self esteem, a byproduct of bad social anxiety and surely someone would sit by him. A part of him wanted it to be the boy lingering outside resting his arm against the wall. Cyrus recognized the boy from somewhere. His parents were probably famous. </p><p>Cyrus knew it was rude to stare, but the boy looked so alone. </p><p>Staring at him won&rsquo;t make him feel any better, Cyrus muttered to himself. He would count to three and on three he would invite the boy in. </p><p>&ldquo;One&hellip;. two&hellip;&rdquo; The boy moved away. Cyrus&rsquo;s eyes followed the boy&rsquo;s movements down the hall. Cyrus pondered following him, but he doubted that would make a good first impression. So, Cyrus waited inside, hoping someone would say hi to him. </p><p>He knew that house meant family, but he was really hoping to make a friend before the sorting ceremony. </p><p>He quickly spotted a girl with her head down. Or maybe not a girl. Cyrus wasn&rsquo;t sure. The black pixie haired person knocked on Cyrus&rsquo;s cabin door. </p><p>&ldquo;Uh, is this seat taken?&rdquo; they asked. </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah. Yeah. It&rsquo;s free. Come sit,&rdquo; Cyrus&rsquo;s words were jumbled up and thrown together so quickly the person waiting outside was unsure of what he said. Cyrus made a come in gesture to clarify. They came in. </p><p>It was a minute of awkward silence before Cyrus resumed blabbering. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Cyrus, boy, Mum says I&rsquo;m gonna get into Hufflepuff. She&rsquo;s probably right. Who are you?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Um, I&rsquo;m-You probably already know who I am. Take a guess.&rdquo; </p><p>Cyrus took a hard look. They certainly looked familiar. </p><p>Cyrus sighed. &ldquo;Yeah, I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a first. Andi. Andi Mack. <i>The gir</i>l,&rdquo; Andi rolled their eyes. &ldquo;Who lived.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m guessing you don&rsquo;t like that nickname.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Not in the slightest. Andi is fine. I prepare they/them, teen, enby is a good describing word. Stuff like that. My grandparents think I&rsquo;m gonna get into Ravenclaw but wanna know a secret?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Sure, I would love that.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I want Gryffindor. Saying it aloud feels so&hellip; hmm what&rsquo;s the word? Liberating.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s cool.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I know right. Gryffindor&hellip; brave at heart&hellip; i can just imagine it already. Studying by a warm fire. Quidditch. Making house colored theme bracelets. I craft &nbsp;A LOT. wanna see the ones I brought today?&rdquo; </p><p>Cyrus nodded. He finally made a friend. </p><p>Andi showed the bracelets on their arm, explaining the story behind each one. Cyrus tried to listen but got distracted by outside of his and Andi&rsquo;s cabin. The boy was back. And he looked lonelier than before. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey, Andi I&rsquo;m really sorry to disrupt you talking about your bracelets&hellip; which are lovely by the way&hellip; but there&rsquo;s someone I need to talk to.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Oooh who is it?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know his name. But he&rsquo;s really cute.&rdquo; </p><p>Andi shrugged. They knew what crushes were like. Cyrus definitely had a crush. On a boy. Ooh. </p><p>&ldquo;Go on. Get him.&rdquo; </p><p>Cyrus smiled. &ldquo;Um, ok.&rdquo; </p><p>Cyrus got up and headed towards the door. What the boy doesn&rsquo;t want to&hellip; Cyrus hesitated. What if the boy wasn&rsquo;t gay or what if he was gay and decided that Cyrus wasn&rsquo;t cute enough or what if&hellip; His thoughts began spiraling. He turned the knob, opening the door a crack before racing back to his seat. </p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p><p>He sat down. </p><p>&ldquo;What do you mean you can&rsquo;t?&rdquo; Andi asked, confused. </p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s&hellip; I uh&hellip; I can&rsquo;t.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Sure, you can.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I really can&rsquo;t right now, Andi.
