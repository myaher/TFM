teasing your brother!\u201d I was sitting in the passenger seat and looked back, at my children. The older sister was constantly teasing her younger brother, Anthony, causing him to complain and cry. But she didn\u2019t stop, even when I told her to. \u201cFrigga, if you don\u2019t stop with this right now, Santa will put you on the naughty list and you won\u2019t get any presents.\u201d Loki was driving and he slightly slowed down, while he was scolding his daughter. She immediately stopped and turned her attention to the scenery outside, causing Anthony to calm down. </p><p>I sighed in relieve and looked at my husband. \u201cThank you.\u201d He smiled, still looking at the road and grabbed my hand. He continued to hold it for the rest of the ride, and as the kids fell asleep, I even managed to get a few minutes of rest. I was only awoken by my children who were shouting for me to wake up. Loki was standing outside the car, and after rubbing my eyes, I finally noticed that we arrived at the Avenger Tower. </p><p>I took the hand Loki offered me and he pulled me out of the car. I was about to walk to the trunk, to get our luggage, but Loki held me back. \u201cI\u2019ll take care of that later, let\u2019s just go upstairs for now.\u201d I nodded and yawned, letting him lead me to the elevator. The kids were already waiting, talking to my dad\u2019s AI, Friday. </p><p>The door to the elevator opened and we got inside. Immediately, the doors closed and we began to ascent to one of the top floors. We were welcomed by my dad and mom. They hugged the kids and us and led us to the living room, where the rest of the team was waiting. </p><p>Peter, was playing with Ed, my little brother. Nat and Bruce were sitting at the dinner table, trying to teach Pipa, the Russian girl they adopted, how to write her name, even if it wasn\u2019t crowned with a lot of success. Frigga immediately ran to them and climbed onto the chair beside Pipa. Steve was talking to Bucky and Clint, while Clint\u2019s wife was sitting on the couch talking to Wanda and Vision, who were holding hands. I knew that some others were coming later, but to be honest, there were already so many people here, it was almost claustrophobic. But one of the most important was missing. Thor \u2013 oh, there he was. \u201cBrother! Y/N!\u201d His voice was booming through the whole living room, as he jogged towards us. He gave me a bone crushing hug and patted his brother on the shoulder. \u201cIt\u2019s good to see you, Thor.\u201d I smiled at him. \u201cUncle Thor!\u201d Anthony ran to his uncle and jumped into his arms. Thor raised the boy over his head and they started to play. Thor winked at me and I nodded, thankfully. I then grabbed Loki\u2019s hand and pulled him back to elevator. \u201cLet\u2019s get the luggage to our room.\u201d He nodded and we took the elevator down. Frigga was still with Pipa and Anthony was save with Thor. The first time in forever that I didn\u2019t have to look after the two. </p><p>While we waited for the doors to open, Loki turned me towards him and pressed me against the elevator wall. In milliseconds, his lips were on mine, fighting for dominance. My hands wandered to his hair, where they gently tugged. This made him moan and I used it to connect our tongues. His hands were gripping my waist tightly, before they started to wander down. First to my ass, and then to the back of my thighs. He grabbed them and I jumped, wrapping my legs around his waist. </p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s make a baby.\u201d He was out of breath and his voice was probably the most seductive thing I\u2019ve ever heard. But not seductive enough. \u201cNo.\u201d I pulled away and looked at my husband. \u201cWe already have two and that\u2019s enough.\u201d Loki chuckled and dived into my neck, placing wet, open mouthed kisses everywhere. \u201cI mean it Loki!\u201d He pulled away and smirked at me. \u201cMhmm, I know you do.\u201d He quickly pecked my lips, before he let me down again. That was the end of our make out session. </p><p>\u201cRight, did you pack the sweets?\u201d I turned to him and raised an eyebrow. \u201cOf course!\u201d \u201cAnd the costumes?\u201d He nodded and pulled me close. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. We have everything we need right here.\u201d I nodded and pecked his cheek. \u201cThanks babe.\u201d He rolled his eyes, but laughed. </p><p>The elevator finally stopped and we quickly got the luggage and brought it to my old room. Everything was still the same, as if I had never left. I smiled at the memory of Loki helping me with it. It was the first thing we did together. I quickly unpacked the clothes and put everything in it\u2019s place. In the meantime, Loki got the kids, so I could put them in their costumes. Frigga dressed up as an Asgardian goddess, while Anthony wanted to be a scarecrow. Frigga was finished quite quickly, but the make up for Anthony took a bit longer. Thanks to Loki, who had let me practice on his face, I was done after five minutes. \u201cPerfect. I\u2019ll bring you upstairs.\u201d I took my children by their hands and led them upstairs, where Pipa and Ed where already dressed up. Pipa was a Ninja and Ed was a cute little ghost. Pepper volunteered to take care of the kids until everyone else was ready, so I left them with her.</p><p>Downstairs, Loki was already finished with his costume. After years of begging I finally managed to get him to dress up as a witch. He wasn\u2019t amused, but still grinned at me, when I walked out. To make up for his costume I wanted to surprise him, and apparently, I did. I walked out of the bathroom, dressed as a female Loki. Complete from the helmet to the leather boots. He licked his lips, his eyes were blown with lust. Walking towards me, he quickly grabbed my waist and pulled me closer. \u201cI love you.\u201d I didn\u2019t even have time to giggle, before he was kissing me again. Turning us around, he began to walk me backwards toward the big bed. \u201cLoki\u2026\u201d He ignored me and sealed my mouth with another kiss. \u201cLoki!\u201d He pulled away and pouted. \u201cYou can\u2019t put something like that on and then tell me that I can\u2019t fuck you.\u201d I chuckled at his words and put my arms around his neck. \u201cMaybe you can. But later.\u201d I pecked his lips and walked out of the door. I could hear him sigh, before he followed me. He had to take the pointed hat off when he walked through the doors, making me giggle. </p><p>When we entered the living room again, Thor\u2019s laugh echoed through the whole room. \u201cI always told you, you are a witch!\u201d He leaned back, still laughing and pointed at Loki. The others chuckled at Thor\u2019s reaction. Loki was about to turn back, but I grabbed his hand and pulled him further inside. \u201cMommy! Daddy!\u201d Our kids ran towards us and hugged us. I picked Anthony up, while Loki bounced Frigga on his waist. She giggled, before she leaned down and kissed her father\u2019s cheek. \u201cYou are the most beautiful witch I know.\u201d \u201cBetter than Sabrina?\u201d Frigga eagerly nodded, making Loki chuckle. \u201cThanks dear, that\u2019s very nice of you.\u201d He quickly pecked her lips, before he let her down again. </p><p>The other adults had also dressed up. Tony and Pepper were dressed as salt and pepper, with Tony being the pepper and Pepper being the salt. Bruce was dressed as Superman, while Nat looked like a scientist. Thor wore a devil costume, while Clint looked like a hawk. Peter was dressed as a spider and kept running from Clint, who was chasing him, acting as if he wanted to eat the poor boy.</p><p>Wanda and Vision dressed up as skeletons. Bucky looked like a Zombie and Steve was dressed as the American flag. I laughed at the different costumes.</p><p>Then, Tony clapped and announced that the adults should go to the stations and that the other kids would soon be here. And he was right. Since Loki and I were going to cook with my mom, we waited by the elevator to welcome the kids that were invited. Their parents tagged along, and soon it was super crowded in the living room. Thankfully, the different stations were all over the tower. </p><p>The kids could watch crazy scientist develop new drinks or they could get their faces painted. At another station, they could bob for apples and eat them. Stations like these were everywhere and soon, everyone was busy. But they were also laughing. I smiled while I watched my kids throw cakes at their grandfather, but I soon had to help my mom and Loki again. </p><p>While the kids were playing, we took care of all the scary food. Fingers with nails and fresh blood, poisoned apples, eyeballs and maggots with bacon were all ready within a few hours. Just in time for all the children to arrive. Tired and hungry, they came into the kitchen and got their food, before they sat down in front of the giant screen and watched \u2018A Nightmare before Christmas\u2019. While they were busy, we started to clean up. The men took care of the heavy stuff, while the women were taking care of all the things that needed to be washed and put away. </p><p>\u201cThat was so much fun.\u201d Nat was grinning from ear to ear, while she was drying a pot. \u201cIt sure was. I hope we\u2019ll do this again.\u201d I stood on my tiptoes, trying to reach one of the highest shelves to put a bowl away, but I was just a millimetre to tiny. \u201cLet me.\u201d Loki suddenly was behind me and took the bowl from my hands. He put it away, before he turned me around and put me on the kitchen counter. \u201cAre you finished?\u201d He nodded and smiled at me. \u201cPerfect! Grab some food if you want to.\u201d He nodded again and quickly pecked my lips, before he got himself a plate and filled it with maggots and fingers. He then walked to the living room and sat down with our kids. My mom smiled at me.</p><p>\u201cAre you happy?\u201d \u201cVery.\u201d She smiled again and pulled me into a hug. \u201cI love you.\u201d \u201cI love you too, mom.\u201d She pecked my cheek, before she shooed me and the others out of the kitchen and told us to enjoy the movie. After some arguing, we left and I sat down beside Loki. He wrapped his arm around my waist and pulled me close. \u201cYour parents will take the kids tonight.\u201d I looked at him and rolled my eyes, while chuckling. \u201cYou\u2019re the worst.\u201d \u201cAnd you love me.\u201d I nodded and leaned closer to him. \u201cI sure do.\u201d I pecked his lips, before I turned back to the screen. His lips pressed against the top of my head, making me smile. </p><p>After the movie was finished, the other kids left. My parents even prepared a gift bag for every single one, filled with sweets. Loki and I took our kids back to our room, where we changed their clothes and got them ready for bed. They were tired but smiling the whole time. They had a lot of fun this night. We brought them to my parents, where they joined Ed in his room. \u201cGood night, you two!\u201d We wished Tony and Pepper a good night, before we walked back to our own bedroom. Loki had changed, but I was still wearing my costume. </p><p>As we entered our room, I closed the door behind us and leaned against it. Loki didn\u2019t notice and kept walking to the bed. Only when he turned around to look at me, did he notice that I was still by the door. \u201cWhat-?\u201d Before he could say anymore, I reached up and started to unbutton my costume. The jacket, I was wearing was just hiding my real costume. Green and gold lingerie hugged my body in all the right places. My legs were covered in fishnets and the boots reached up to my knees. I could see Loki swallow hard as I started to walk towards him. I grinned at him seductively and shoved him, making him fall onto the bed. I immediately followed and straddled him. His hands reached up, to grab my waist but I grabbed them and put them back onto the bed. Then, I leaned down. \u201cToday, we\u2019ll play with my rules.\u201d I straightened again and grinned at him. \u201cFirst, no touching, unless I allow it.\u201d My hands travelled down his chest, until they reached the hem of his shirt. I then pulled it up and over his head. \u201cSecond, you have to do everything I say.\u201d Loki swallowed, which made me smirk. It was the first time that I managed to get under his skin like that. \u201cThird, no cumming until I say so.\u201d His breath was heavy and I could already feel his hard on, rubbing against my thigh. </p><p>I slowly started to move against him, watching him moan at the feeling. His hands were grabbing the bedsheet, trying not to touch me. I grinned at the effect I had on him. Slowly, I started to crawl down, until I was kneeling between his legs. I grabbed the hem of his shorts and started to pull it down, freeing his member. I bit my lower lip as I watched the precum glisten on the top. I grabbed Loki\u2019s cock and he threw his head back, making me chuckle. I then, leaned forward and licked the precum off the tip, making him arch his back. He moaned loudly and his knuckles were turning white from the force he used to hold on to the sheets. Grinning, I decided to stop the teasing\u2026for now. </p><p>I took him in my mouth and started to bob my head up and down, switching the pace from time to time. When I felt that he was close to cumming, I let go of him and stood up. \u201cW-What are you doing?\u201d He stared at me wide eyed. \u201cWhy? What do you want?\u201d I crawled on top of him again and licked my lips. \u201cTell me. What do you want me to do?\u201d He released a breath and grunted. \u201cFuck me&hellip;\u201d I had to bite the inside of my cheek to keep myself from grinning at him. Instead I tilted my head and frowned at him. \u201cWhat? I couldn\u2019t hear you.\u201d \u201cFuck me!\u201d He roared, still breathing heavy. I grinned. \u201cWith pleasure.\u201d</p><p>I stood up again and took my costume off. I made sure that he could see every little detail perfectly. \u201cYou\u2019re killing me.\u201d I smiled at him, while I straddled him again. \u201cBut you love it.\u201d I hovered over the top of his cock, slightly grazing it from time to time. \u201cPlease&hellip;please&hellip;!\u201d I let myself sink down on it, moaning at the feeling of being completely filled. Loki\u2019s hands automatically went to my waist. I shot him a glare, but quickly nodded. \u201cKeep them there.\u201d Loki nodded. </p><p>I rose up until only the tip of him was inside of me, then I let myself sink again. I repeated this, until I found the right rhythm. Loki helped me to ride him and I knew that he enjoyed by the way his grip on me tightened with every movement I made. But apparently I was still way to slow. Grunting, Loki sat up, and wrapped his arms around me. He quickly flipped us over, making me lay beneath him. Without missing a beat, he started to thrust inside me. He set such a quick speed, that I didn\u2019t even try to keep up with it. Within seconds, he had me writhing beneath him, begging him for release. And he gave me just that. His hands wandered between our bodies and he started to rub my clit, causing me to scream out in pleasure. </p><p>I threw my head back, moaning and yelling in pure bliss. Loki was still above me and grunted as he, himself came deep within me. </p><p>After we\u2019d calmed down, Loki pulled me close to him. \u201cThat was a great surprise.\u201d He pressed his lips against mine, and I eagerly responded. But way too soon, we had to pull away to breath again. I pressed my forehead against his and smiled.</p><p>\u201cHappy Halloween.\u201d</p>",

teasing your brother!\u201d I was sitting in the passenger seat and looked back, at my children. The older sister was constantly teasing her younger brother, Anthony, causing him to complain and cry. But she didn\u2019t stop, even when I told her to. \u201cFrigga, if you don\u2019t stop with this right now, Santa will put you on the naughty list and you won\u2019t get any presents.\u201d Loki was driving and he slightly slowed down, while he was scolding his daughter. She immediately stopped and turned her attention to the scenery outside, causing Anthony to calm down. </p><p>I sighed in relieve and looked at my husband. \u201cThank you.\u201d He smiled, still looking at the road and grabbed my hand. He continued to hold it for the rest of the ride, and as the kids fell asleep, I even managed to get a few minutes of rest. I was only awoken by my children who were shouting for me to wake up. Loki was standing outside the car, and after rubbing my eyes, I finally noticed that we arrived at the Avenger Tower. </p><p>I took the hand Loki offered me and he pulled me out of the car. I was about to walk to the trunk, to get our luggage, but Loki held me back. \u201cI\u2019ll take care of that later, let\u2019s just go upstairs for now.\u201d I nodded and yawned, letting him lead me to the elevator. The kids were already waiting, talking to my dad\u2019s AI, Friday. </p><p>The door to the elevator opened and we got inside. Immediately, the doors closed and we began to ascent to one of the top floors. We were welcomed by my dad and mom. They hugged the kids and us and led us to the living room, where the rest of the team was waiting. </p><p>Peter, was playing with Ed, my little brother. Nat and Bruce were sitting at the dinner table, trying to teach Pipa, the Russian girl they adopted, how to write her name, even if it wasn\u2019t crowned with a lot of success. Frigga immediately ran to them and climbed onto the chair beside Pipa. Steve was talking to Bucky and Clint, while Clint\u2019s wife was sitting on the couch talking to Wanda and Vision, who were holding hands. I knew that some others were coming later, but to be honest, there were already so many people here, it was almost claustrophobic. But one of the most important was missing. Thor \u2013 oh, there he was. \u201cBrother! Y/N!\u201d His voice was booming through the whole living room, as he jogged towards us. He gave me a bone crushing hug and patted his brother on the shoulder. \u201cIt\u2019s good to see you, Thor.\u201d I smiled at him. \u201cUncle Thor!\u201d Anthony ran to his uncle and jumped into his arms. Thor raised the boy over his head and they started to play. Thor winked at me and I nodded, thankfully. I then grabbed Loki\u2019s hand and pulled him back to elevator. \u201cLet\u2019s get the luggage to our room.\u201d He nodded and we took the elevator down. Frigga was still with Pipa and Anthony was save with Thor. The first time in forever that I didn\u2019t have to look after the two. </p><p>While we waited for the doors to open, Loki turned me towards him and pressed me against the elevator wall. In milliseconds, his lips were on mine, fighting for dominance. My hands wandered to his hair, where they gently tugged. This made him moan and I used it to connect our tongues. His hands were gripping my waist tightly, before they started to wander down. First to my ass, and then to the back of my thighs. He grabbed them and I jumped, wrapping my legs around his waist. </p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s make a baby.\u201d He was out of breath and his voice was probably the most seductive thing I\u2019ve ever heard. But not seductive enough. \u201cNo.\u201d I pulled away and looked at my husband. \u201cWe already have two and that\u2019s enough.\u201d Loki chuckled and dived into my neck, placing wet, open mouthed kisses everywhere. \u201cI mean it Loki!\u201d He pulled away and smirked at me. \u201cMhmm, I know you do.\u201d He quickly pecked my lips, before he let me down again. That was the end of our make out session. </p><p>\u201cRight, did you pack the sweets?\u201d I turned to him and raised an eyebrow. \u201cOf course!\u201d \u201cAnd the costumes?\u201d He nodded and pulled me close. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. We have everything we need right here.\u201d I nodded and pecked his cheek. \u201cThanks babe.\u201d He rolled his eyes, but laughed. </p><p>The elevator finally stopped and we quickly got the luggage and brought it to my old room. Everything was still the same, as if I had never left. I smiled at the memory of Loki helping me with it. It was the first thing we did together. I quickly unpacked the clothes and put everything in it\u2019s place. In the meantime, Loki got the kids, so I could put them in their costumes. Frigga dressed up as an Asgardian goddess, while Anthony wanted to be a scarecrow. Frigga was finished quite quickly, but the make up for Anthony took a bit longer. Thanks to Loki, who had let me practice on his face, I was done after five minutes. \u201cPerfect. I\u2019ll bring you upstairs.\u201d I took my children by their hands and led them upstairs, where Pipa and Ed where already dressed up. Pipa was a Ninja and Ed was a cute little ghost. Pepper volunteered to take care of the kids until everyone else was ready, so I left them with her.</p><p>Downstairs, Loki was already finished with his costume. After years of begging I finally managed to get him to dress up as a witch. He wasn\u2019t amused, but still grinned at me, when I walked out. To make up for his costume I wanted to surprise him, and apparently, I did. I walked out of the bathroom, dressed as a female Loki. Complete from the helmet to the leather boots. He licked his lips, his eyes were blown with lust. Walking towards me, he quickly grabbed my waist and pulled me closer. \u201cI love you.\u201d I didn\u2019t even have time to giggle, before he was kissing me again. Turning us around, he began to walk me backwards toward the big bed. \u201cLoki\u2026\u201d He ignored me and sealed my mouth with another kiss. \u201cLoki!\u201d He pulled away and pouted. \u201cYou can\u2019t put something like that on and then tell me that I can\u2019t fuck you.\u201d I chuckled at his words and put my arms around his neck. \u201cMaybe you can. But later.\u201d I pecked his lips and walked out of the door. I could hear him sigh, before he followed me. He had to take the pointed hat off when he walked through the doors, making me giggle. </p><p>When we entered the living room again, Thor\u2019s laugh echoed through the whole room. \u201cI always told you, you are a witch!\u201d He leaned back, still laughing and pointed at Loki. The others chuckled at Thor\u2019s reaction. Loki was about to turn back, but I grabbed his hand and pulled him further inside. \u201cMommy! Daddy!\u201d Our kids ran towards us and hugged us. I picked Anthony up, while Loki bounced Frigga on his waist. She giggled, before she leaned down and kissed her father\u2019s cheek. \u201cYou are the most beautiful witch I know.\u201d \u201cBetter than Sabrina?\u201d Frigga eagerly nodded, making Loki chuckle. \u201cThanks dear, that\u2019s very nice of you.\u201d He quickly pecked her lips, before he let her down again. </p><p>The other adults had also dressed up. Tony and Pepper were dressed as salt and pepper, with Tony being the pepper and Pepper being the salt. Bruce was dressed as Superman, while Nat looked like a scientist. Thor wore a devil costume, while Clint looked like a hawk. Peter was dressed as a spider and kept running from Clint, who was chasing him, acting as if he wanted to eat the poor boy.</p><p>Wanda and Vision dressed up as skeletons. Bucky looked like a Zombie and Steve was dressed as the American flag. I laughed at the different costumes.</p><p>Then, Tony clapped and announced that the adults should go to the stations and that the other kids would soon be here. And he was right. Since Loki and I were going to cook with my mom, we waited by the elevator to welcome the kids that were invited. Their parents tagged along, and soon it was super crowded in the living room. Thankfully, the different stations were all over the tower. </p><p>The kids could watch crazy scientist develop new drinks or they could get their faces painted. At another station, they could bob for apples and eat them. Stations like these were everywhere and soon, everyone was busy. But they were also laughing. I smiled while I watched my kids throw cakes at their grandfather, but I soon had to help my mom and Loki again. </p><p>While the kids were playing, we took care of all the scary food. Fingers with nails and fresh blood, poisoned apples, eyeballs and maggots with bacon were all ready within a few hours. Just in time for all the children to arrive. Tired and hungry, they came into the kitchen and got their food, before they sat down in front of the giant screen and watched \u2018A Nightmare before Christmas\u2019. While they were busy, we started to clean up. The men took care of the heavy stuff, while the women were taking care of all the things that needed to be washed and put away. </p><p>\u201cThat was so much fun.\u201d Nat was grinning from ear to ear, while she was drying a pot. \u201cIt sure was. I hope we\u2019ll do this again.\u201d I stood on my tiptoes, trying to reach one of the highest shelves to put a bowl away, but I was just a millimetre to tiny. \u201cLet me.\u201d Loki suddenly was behind me and took the bowl from my hands. He put it away, before he turned me around and put me on the kitchen counter. \u201cAre you finished?\u201d He nodded and smiled at me. \u201cPerfect! Grab some food if you want to.\u201d He nodded again and quickly pecked my lips, before he got himself a plate and filled it with maggots and fingers. He then walked to the living room and sat down with our kids. My mom smiled at me.</p><p>\u201cAre you happy?\u201d \u201cVery.\u201d She smiled again and pulled me into a hug. \u201cI love you.\u201d \u201cI love you too, mom.\u201d She pecked my cheek, before she shooed me and the others out of the kitchen and told us to enjoy the movie. After some arguing, we left and I sat down beside Loki. He wrapped his arm around my waist and pulled me close. \u201cYour parents will take the kids tonight.\u201d I looked at him and rolled my eyes, while chuckling. \u201cYou\u2019re the worst.\u201d \u201cAnd you love me.\u201d I nodded and leaned closer to him. \u201cI sure do.\u201d I pecked his lips, before I turned back to the screen. His lips pressed against the top of my head, making me smile. </p><p>After the movie was finished, the other kids left. My parents even prepared a gift bag for every single one, filled with sweets. Loki and I took our kids back to our room, where we changed their clothes and got them ready for bed. They were tired but smiling the whole time. They had a lot of fun this night. We brought them to my parents, where they joined Ed in his room. \u201cGood night, you two!\u201d We wished Tony and Pepper a good night, before we walked back to our own bedroom. Loki had changed, but I was still wearing my costume. </p><p>As we entered our room, I closed the door behind us and leaned against it. Loki didn\u2019t notice and kept walking to the bed. Only when he turned around to look at me, did he notice that I was still by the door. \u201cWhat-?\u201d Before he could say anymore, I reached up and started to unbutton my costume. The jacket, I was wearing was just hiding my real costume. Green and gold lingerie hugged my body in all the right places. My legs were covered in fishnets and the boots reached up to my knees. I could see Loki swallow hard as I started to walk towards him. I grinned at him seductively and shoved him, making him fall onto the bed. I immediately followed and straddled him. His hands reached up, to grab my waist but I grabbed them and put them back onto the bed. Then, I leaned down. \u201cToday, we\u2019ll play with my rules.\u201d I straightened again and grinned at him. \u201cFirst, no touching, unless I allow it.\u201d My hands travelled down his chest, until they reached the hem of his shirt. I then pulled it up and over his head. \u201cSecond, you have to do everything I say.\u201d Loki swallowed, which made me smirk. It was the first time that I managed to get under his skin like that. \u201cThird, no cumming until I say so.\u201d His breath was heavy and I could already feel his hard on, rubbing against my thigh. </p><p>I slowly started to move against him, watching him moan at the feeling. His hands were grabbing the bedsheet, trying not to touch me. I grinned at the effect I had on him. Slowly, I started to crawl down, until I was kneeling between his legs. I grabbed the hem of his shorts and started to pull it down, freeing his member. I bit my lower lip as I watched the precum glisten on the top. I grabbed Loki\u2019s cock and he threw his head back, making me chuckle. I then, leaned forward and licked the precum off the tip, making him arch his back. He moaned loudly and his knuckles were turning white from the force he used to hold on to the sheets. Grinning, I decided to stop the teasing\u2026for now. </p><p>I took him in my mouth and started to bob my head up and down, switching the pace from time to time. When I felt that he was close to cumming, I let go of him and stood up. \u201cW-What are you doing?\u201d He stared at me wide eyed. \u201cWhy? What do you want?\u201d I crawled on top of him again and licked my lips. \u201cTell me. What do you want me to do?\u201d He released a breath and grunted. \u201cFuck me\u2026\u201d I had to bite the inside of my cheek to keep myself from grinning at him. Instead I tilted my head and frowned at him. \u201cWhat? I couldn\u2019t hear you.\u201d \u201cFuck me!\u201d He roared, still breathing heavy. I grinned. \u201cWith pleasure.\u201d</p><p>I stood up again and took my costume off. I made sure that he could see every little detail perfectly. \u201cYou\u2019re killing me.\u201d I smiled at him, while I straddled him again. \u201cBut you love it.\u201d I hovered over the top of his cock, slightly grazing it from time to time. \u201cPlease\u2026please\u2026!\u201d I let myself sink down on it, moaning at the feeling of being completely filled. Loki\u2019s hands automatically went to my waist. I shot him a glare, but quickly nodded. \u201cKeep them there.\u201d Loki nodded. </p><p>I rose up until only the tip of him was inside of me, then I let myself sink again. I repeated this, until I found the right rhythm. Loki helped me to ride him and I knew that he enjoyed by the way his grip on me tightened with every movement I made. But apparently I was still way to slow. Grunting, Loki sat up, and wrapped his arms around me. He quickly flipped us over, making me lay beneath him. Without missing a beat, he started to thrust inside me. He set such a quick speed, that I didn\u2019t even try to keep up with it. Within seconds, he had me writhing beneath him, begging him for release. And he gave me just that. His hands wandered between our bodies and he started to rub my clit, causing me to scream out in pleasure. </p><p>I threw my head back, moaning and yelling in pure bliss. Loki was still above me and grunted as he, himself came deep within me. </p><p>After we\u2019d calmed down, Loki pulled me close to him. \u201cThat was a great surprise.\u201d He pressed his lips against mine, and I eagerly responded. But way too soon, we had to pull away to breath again. I pressed my forehead against his and smiled.</p><p>\u201cHappy Halloween.\u201d</p></p>",

teasing your brother!\u201d I was sitting in the passenger seat and looked back, at my children. The older sister was constantly teasing her younger brother, Anthony, causing him to complain and cry. But she didn\u2019t stop, even when I told her to. \u201cFrigga, if you don\u2019t stop with this right now, Santa will put you on the naughty list and you won\u2019t get any presents.\u201d Loki was driving and he slightly slowed down, while he was scolding his daughter. She immediately stopped and turned her attention to the scenery outside, causing Anthony to calm down. </p><p>I sighed in relieve and looked at my husband. \u201cThank you.\u201d He smiled, still looking at the road and grabbed my hand. He continued to hold it for the rest of the ride, and as the kids fell asleep, I even managed to get a few minutes of rest. I was only awoken by my children who were shouting for me to wake up. Loki was standing outside the car, and after rubbing my eyes, I finally noticed that we arrived at the Avenger Tower. </p><p>I took the hand Loki offered me and he pulled me out of the car. I was about to walk to the trunk, to get our luggage, but Loki held me back. \u201cI\u2019ll take care of that later, let\u2019s just go upstairs for now.\u201d I nodded and yawned, letting him lead me to the elevator. The kids were already waiting, talking to my dad\u2019s AI, Friday. </p><p>The door to the elevator opened and we got inside. Immediately, the doors closed and we began to ascent to one of the top floors. We were welcomed by my dad and mom. They hugged the kids and us and led us to the living room, where the rest of the team was waiting. </p><p>Peter, was playing with Ed, my little brother. Nat and Bruce were sitting at the dinner table, trying to teach Pipa, the Russian girl they adopted, how to write her name, even if it wasn\u2019t crowned with a lot of success. Frigga immediately ran to them and climbed onto the chair beside Pipa. Steve was talking to Bucky and Clint, while Clint\u2019s wife was sitting on the couch talking to Wanda and Vision, who were holding hands. I knew that some others were coming later, but to be honest, there were already so many people here, it was almost claustrophobic. But one of the most important was missing. Thor \u2013 oh, there he was. \u201cBrother! Y/N!\u201d His voice was booming through the whole living room, as he jogged towards us. He gave me a bone crushing hug and patted his brother on the shoulder. \u201cIt\u2019s good to see you, Thor.\u201d I smiled at him. \u201cUncle Thor!\u201d Anthony ran to his uncle and jumped into his arms. Thor raised the boy over his head and they started to play. Thor winked at me and I nodded, thankfully. I then grabbed Loki\u2019s hand and pulled him back to elevator. \u201cLet\u2019s get the luggage to our room.\u201d He nodded and we took the elevator down. Frigga was still with Pipa and Anthony was save with Thor. The first time in forever that I didn\u2019t have to look after the two. </p><p>While we waited for the doors to open, Loki turned me towards him and pressed me against the elevator wall. In milliseconds, his lips were on mine, fighting for dominance. My hands wandered to his hair, where they gently tugged. This made him moan and I used it to connect our tongues. His hands were gripping my waist tightly, before they started to wander down. First to my ass, and then to the back of my thighs. He grabbed them and I jumped, wrapping my legs around his waist. </p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s make a baby.\u201d He was out of breath and his voice was probably the most seductive thing I\u2019ve ever heard. But not seductive enough. \u201cNo.\u201d I pulled away and looked at my husband. \u201cWe already have two and that\u2019s enough.\u201d Loki chuckled and dived into my neck, placing wet, open mouthed kisses everywhere. \u201cI mean it Loki!\u201d He pulled away and smirked at me. \u201cMhmm, I know you do.\u201d He quickly pecked my lips, before he let me down again. That was the end of our make out session. </p><p>\u201cRight, did you pack the sweets?\u201d I turned to him and raised an eyebrow. \u201cOf course!\u201d \u201cAnd the costumes?\u201d He nodded and pulled me close. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. We have everything we need right here.\u201d I nodded and pecked his cheek. \u201cThanks babe.\u201d He rolled his eyes, but laughed. </p><p>The elevator finally stopped and we quickly got the luggage and brought it to my old room. Everything was still the same, as if I had never left. I smiled at the memory of Loki helping me with it. It was the first thing we did together. I quickly unpacked the clothes and put everything in it\u2019s place. In the meantime, Loki got the kids, so I could put them in their costumes. Frigga dressed up as an Asgardian goddess, while Anthony wanted to be a scarecrow. Frigga was finished quite quickly, but the make up for Anthony took a bit longer. Thanks to Loki, who had let me practice on his face, I was done after five minutes. \u201cPerfect. I\u2019ll bring you upstairs.\u201d I took my children by their hands and led them upstairs, where Pipa and Ed where already dressed up. Pipa was a Ninja and Ed was a cute little ghost. Pepper volunteered to take care of the kids until everyone else was ready, so I left them with her.</p><p>Downstairs, Loki was already finished with his costume. After years of begging I finally managed to get him to dress up as a witch. He wasn\u2019t amused, but still grinned at me, when I walked out. To make up for his costume I wanted to surprise him, and apparently, I did. I walked out of the bathroom, dressed as a female Loki. Complete from the helmet to the leather boots. He licked his lips, his eyes were blown with lust. Walking towards me, he quickly grabbed my waist and pulled me closer. \u201cI love you.\u201d I didn\u2019t even have time to giggle, before he was kissing me again. Turning us around, he began to walk me backwards toward the big bed. \u201cLoki\u2026\u201d He ignored me and sealed my mouth with another kiss. \u201cLoki!\u201d He pulled away and pouted. \u201cYou can\u2019t put something like that on and then tell me that I can\u2019t fuck you.\u201d I chuckled at his words and put my arms around his neck. \u201cMaybe you can. But later.\u201d I pecked his lips and walked out of the door. I could hear him sigh, before he followed me. He had to take the pointed hat off when he walked through the doors, making me giggle. </p><p>When we entered the living room again, Thor\u2019s laugh echoed through the whole room. \u201cI always told you, you are a witch!\u201d He leaned back, still laughing and pointed at Loki. The others chuckled at Thor\u2019s reaction. Loki was about to turn back, but I grabbed his hand and pulled him further inside. \u201cMommy! Daddy!\u201d Our kids ran towards us and hugged us. I picked Anthony up, while Loki bounced Frigga on his waist. She giggled, before she leaned down and kissed her father\u2019s cheek. \u201cYou are the most beautiful witch I know.\u201d \u201cBetter than Sabrina?\u201d Frigga eagerly nodded, making Loki chuckle. \u201cThanks dear, that\u2019s very nice of you.\u201d He quickly pecked her lips, before he let her down again. </p><p>The other adults had also dressed up. Tony and Pepper were dressed as salt and pepper, with Tony being the pepper and Pepper being the salt. Bruce was dressed as Superman, while Nat looked like a scientist. Thor wore a devil costume, while Clint looked like a hawk. Peter was dressed as a spider and kept running from Clint, who was chasing him, acting as if he wanted to eat the poor boy.</p><p>Wanda and Vision dressed up as skeletons. Bucky looked like a Zombie and Steve was dressed as the American flag. I laughed at the different costumes.</p><p>Then, Tony clapped and announced that the adults should go to the stations and that the other kids would soon be here. And he was right. Since Loki and I were going to cook with my mom, we waited by the elevator to welcome the kids that were invited. Their parents tagged along, and soon it was super crowded in the living room. Thankfully, the different stations were all over the tower. </p><p>The kids could watch crazy scientist develop new drinks or they could get their faces painted. At another station, they could bob for apples and eat them. Stations like these were everywhere and soon, everyone was busy. But they were also laughing. I smiled while I watched my kids throw cakes at their grandfather, but I soon had to help my mom and Loki again. </p><p>While the kids were playing, we took care of all the scary food. Fingers with nails and fresh blood, poisoned apples, eyeballs and maggots with bacon were all ready within a few hours. Just in time for all the children to arrive. Tired and hungry, they came into the kitchen and got their food, before they sat down in front of the giant screen and watched \u2018A Nightmare before Christmas\u2019. While they were busy, we started to clean up. The men took care of the heavy stuff, while the women were taking care of all the things that needed to be washed and put away. </p><p>\u201cThat was so much fun.\u201d Nat was grinning from ear to ear, while she was drying a pot. \u201cIt sure was. I hope we\u2019ll do this again.\u201d I stood on my tiptoes, trying to reach one of the highest shelves to put a bowl away, but I was just a millimetre to tiny. \u201cLet me.\u201d Loki suddenly was behind me and took the bowl from my hands. He put it away, before he turned me around and put me on the kitchen counter. \u201cAre you finished?\u201d He nodded and smiled at me. \u201cPerfect! Grab some food if you want to.\u201d He nodded again and quickly pecked my lips, before he got himself a plate and filled it with maggots and fingers. He then walked to the living room and sat down with our kids. My mom smiled at me.</p><p>\u201cAre you happy?\u201d \u201cVery.\u201d She smiled again and pulled me into a hug. \u201cI love you.\u201d \u201cI love you too, mom.\u201d She pecked my cheek, before she shooed me and the others out of the kitchen and told us to enjoy the movie. After some arguing, we left and I sat down beside Loki. He wrapped his arm around my waist and pulled me close. \u201cYour parents will take the kids tonight.\u201d I looked at him and rolled my eyes, while chuckling. \u201cYou\u2019re the worst.\u201d \u201cAnd you love me.\u201d I nodded and leaned closer to him. \u201cI sure do.\u201d I pecked his lips, before I turned back to the screen. His lips pressed against the top of my head, making me smile. </p><p>After the movie was finished, the other kids left. My parents even prepared a gift bag for every single one, filled with sweets. Loki and I took our kids back to our room, where we changed their clothes and got them ready for bed. They were tired but smiling the whole time. They had a lot of fun this night. We brought them to my parents, where they joined Ed in his room. \u201cGood night, you two!\u201d We wished Tony and Pepper a good night, before we walked back to our own bedroom. Loki had changed, but I was still wearing my costume. </p><p>As we entered our room, I closed the door behind us and leaned against it. Loki didn\u2019t notice and kept walking to the bed. Only when he turned around to look at me, did he notice that I was still by the door. \u201cWhat-?\u201d Before he could say anymore, I reached up and started to unbutton my costume. The jacket, I was wearing was just hiding my real costume. Green and gold lingerie hugged my body in all the right places. My legs were covered in fishnets and the boots reached up to my knees. I could see Loki swallow hard as I started to walk towards him. I grinned at him seductively and shoved him, making him fall onto the bed. I immediately followed and straddled him. His hands reached up, to grab my waist but I grabbed them and put them back onto the bed. Then, I leaned down. \u201cToday, we\u2019ll play with my rules.\u201d I straightened again and grinned at him. \u201cFirst, no touching, unless I allow it.\u201d My hands travelled down his chest, until they reached the hem of his shirt. I then pulled it up and over his head. \u201cSecond, you have to do everything I say.\u201d Loki swallowed, which made me smirk. It was the first time that I managed to get under his skin like that. \u201cThird, no cumming until I say so.\u201d His breath was heavy and I could already feel his hard on, rubbing against my thigh. </p><p>I slowly started to move against him, watching him moan at the feeling. His hands were grabbing the bedsheet, trying not to touch me. I grinned at the effect I had on him. Slowly, I started to crawl down, until I was kneeling between his legs. I grabbed the hem of his shorts and started to pull it down, freeing his member. I bit my lower lip as I watched the precum glisten on the top. I grabbed Loki\u2019s cock and he threw his head back, making me chuckle. I then, leaned forward and licked the precum off the tip, making him arch his back. He moaned loudly and his knuckles were turning white from the force he used to hold on to the sheets. Grinning, I decided to stop the teasing\u2026for now. </p><p>I took him in my mouth and started to bob my head up and down, switching the pace from time to time. When I felt that he was close to cumming, I let go of him and stood up. \u201cW-What are you doing?\u201d He stared at me wide eyed. \u201cWhy? What do you want?\u201d I crawled on top of him again and licked my lips. \u201cTell me. What do you want me to do?\u201d He released a breath and grunted. \u201cFuck me\u2026\u201d I had to bite the inside of my cheek to keep myself from grinning at him. Instead I tilted my head and frowned at him. \u201cWhat? I couldn\u2019t hear you.\u201d \u201cFuck me!\u201d He roared, still breathing heavy. I grinned. \u201cWith pleasure.\u201d</p><p>I stood up again and took my costume off. I made sure that he could see every little detail perfectly. \u201cYou\u2019re killing me.\u201d I smiled at him, while I straddled him again. \u201cBut you love it.\u201d I hovered over the top of his cock, slightly grazing it from time to time. \u201cPlease\u2026please\u2026!\u201d I let myself sink down on it, moaning at the feeling of being completely filled. Loki\u2019s hands automatically went to my waist. I shot him a glare, but quickly nodded. \u201cKeep them there.\u201d Loki nodded. </p><p>I rose up until only the tip of him was inside of me, then I let myself sink again. I repeated this, until I found the right rhythm. Loki helped me to ride him and I knew that he enjoyed by the way his grip on me tightened with every movement I made. But apparently I was still way to slow. Grunting, Loki sat up, and wrapped his arms around me. He quickly flipped us over, making me lay beneath him. Without missing a beat, he started to thrust inside me. He set such a quick speed, that I didn\u2019t even try to keep up with it. Within seconds, he had me writhing beneath him, begging him for release. And he gave me just that. His hands wandered between our bodies and he started to rub my clit, causing me to scream out in pleasure. </p><p>I threw my head back, moaning and yelling in pure bliss. Loki was still above me and grunted as he, himself came deep within me. </p><p>After we\u2019d calmed down, Loki pulled me close to him. \u201cThat was a great surprise.\u201d He pressed his lips against mine, and I eagerly responded. But way too soon, we had to pull away to breath again. I pressed my forehead against his and smiled.</p><p>\u201cHappy Halloween.\u201d</p></p>",

class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><p>&ldquo;Frigga, stop teasing your brother!&rdquo; I was sitting in the passenger seat and looked back, at my children. The older sister was constantly teasing her younger brother, Anthony, causing him to complain and cry. But she didn&rsquo;t stop, even when I told her to. &ldquo;Frigga, if you don&rsquo;t stop with this right now, Santa will put you on the naughty list and you won&rsquo;t get any presents.&rdquo; Loki was driving and he slightly slowed down, while he was scolding his daughter. She immediately stopped and turned her attention to the scenery outside, causing Anthony to calm down. </p><p>I sighed in relieve and looked at my husband. &ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo; He smiled, still looking at the road and grabbed my hand. He continued to hold it for the rest of the ride, and as the kids fell asleep, I even managed to get a few minutes of rest. I was only awoken by my children who were shouting for me to wake up. Loki was standing outside the car, and after rubbing my eyes, I finally noticed that we arrived at the Avenger Tower. </p><p>I took the hand Loki offered me and he pulled me out of the car. I was about to walk to the trunk, to get our luggage, but Loki held me back. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take care of that later, let&rsquo;s just go upstairs for now.&rdquo; I nodded and yawned, letting him lead me to the elevator. The kids were already waiting, talking to my dad&rsquo;s AI, Friday. </p><p>The door to the elevator opened and we got inside. Immediately, the doors closed and we began to ascent to one of the top floors. We were welcomed by my dad and mom. They hugged the kids and us and led us to the living room, where the rest of the team was waiting. </p><p>Peter, was playing with Ed, my little brother. Nat and Bruce were sitting at the dinner table, trying to teach Pipa, the Russian girl they adopted, how to write her name, even if it wasn&rsquo;t crowned with a lot of success. Frigga immediately ran to them and climbed onto the chair beside Pipa. Steve was talking to Bucky and Clint, while Clint&rsquo;s wife was sitting on the couch talking to Wanda and Vision, who were holding hands. I knew that some others were coming later, but to be honest, there were already so many people here, it was almost claustrophobic. But one of the most important was missing. Thor &ndash; oh, there he was. &ldquo;Brother! Y/N!&rdquo; His voice was booming through the whole living room, as he jogged towards us. He gave me a bone crushing hug and patted his brother on the shoulder. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s good to see you, Thor.&rdquo; I smiled at him. &ldquo;Uncle Thor!&rdquo; Anthony ran to his uncle and jumped into his arms. Thor raised the boy over his head and they started to play. Thor winked at me and I nodded, thankfully. I then grabbed Loki&rsquo;s hand and pulled him back to elevator. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get the luggage to our room.&rdquo; He nodded and we took the elevator down. Frigga was still with Pipa and Anthony was save with Thor. The first time in forever that I didn&rsquo;t have to look after the two. </p><p>While we waited for the doors to open, Loki turned me towards him and pressed me against the elevator wall. In milliseconds, his lips were on mine, fighting for dominance. My hands wandered to his hair, where they gently tugged. This made him moan and I used it to connect our tongues. His hands were gripping my waist tightly, before they started to wander down. First to my ass, and then to the back of my thighs. He grabbed them and I jumped, wrapping my legs around his waist. </p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s make a baby.&rdquo; He was out of breath and his voice was probably the most seductive thing I&rsquo;ve ever heard. But not seductive enough. &ldquo;No.&rdquo; I pulled away and looked at my husband. &ldquo;We already have two and that&rsquo;s enough.&rdquo; Loki chuckled and dived into my neck, placing wet, open mouthed kisses everywhere. &ldquo;I mean it Loki!&rdquo; He pulled away and smirked at me. &ldquo;Mhmm, I know you do.&rdquo; He quickly pecked my lips, before he let me down again. That was the end of our make out session. </p><p>&ldquo;Right, did you pack the sweets?&rdquo; I turned to him and raised an eyebrow. &ldquo;Of course!&rdquo; &ldquo;And the costumes?&rdquo; He nodded and pulled me close. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry. We have everything we need right here.&rdquo; I nodded and pecked his cheek. &ldquo;Thanks babe.&rdquo; He rolled his eyes, but laughed. </p><p>The elevator finally stopped and we quickly got the luggage and brought it to my old room. Everything was still the same, as if I had never left. I smiled at the memory of Loki helping me with it. It was the first thing we did together. I quickly unpacked the clothes and put everything in it&rsquo;s place. In the meantime, Loki got the kids, so I could put them in their costumes. Frigga dressed up as an Asgardian goddess, while Anthony wanted to be a scarecrow. Frigga was finished quite quickly, but the make up for Anthony took a bit longer. Thanks to Loki, who had let me practice on his face, I was done after five minutes. &ldquo;Perfect. I&rsquo;ll bring you upstairs.&rdquo; I took my children by their hands and led them upstairs, where Pipa and Ed where already dressed up. Pipa was a Ninja and Ed was a cute little ghost. Pepper volunteered to take care of the kids until everyone else was ready, so I left them with her.</p><p>Downstairs, Loki was already finished with his costume. After years of begging I finally managed to get him to dress up as a witch. He wasn&rsquo;t amused, but still grinned at me, when I walked out. To make up for his costume I wanted to surprise him, and apparently, I did. I walked out of the bathroom, dressed as a female Loki. Complete from the helmet to the leather boots. He licked his lips, his eyes were blown with lust. Walking towards me, he quickly grabbed my waist and pulled me closer. &ldquo;I love you.&rdquo; I didn&rsquo;t even have time to giggle, before he was kissing me again. Turning us around, he began to walk me backwards toward the big bed. &ldquo;Loki&hellip;&rdquo; He ignored me and sealed my mouth with another kiss. &ldquo;Loki!&rdquo; He pulled away and pouted. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t put something like that on and then tell me that I can&rsquo;t fuck you.&rdquo; I chuckled at his words and put my arms around his neck. &ldquo;Maybe you can. But later.&rdquo; I pecked his lips and walked out of the door. I could hear him sigh, before he followed me. He had to take the pointed hat off when he walked through the doors, making me giggle. </p><p>When we entered the living room again, Thor&rsquo;s laugh echoed through the whole room. &ldquo;I always told you, you are a witch!&rdquo; He leaned back, still laughing and pointed at Loki. The others chuckled at Thor&rsquo;s reaction. Loki was about to turn back, but I grabbed his hand and pulled him further inside. &ldquo;Mommy! Daddy!&rdquo; Our kids ran towards us and hugged us. I picked Anthony up, while Loki bounced Frigga on his waist. She giggled, before she leaned down and kissed her father&rsquo;s cheek. &ldquo;You are the most beautiful witch I know.&rdquo; &ldquo;Better than Sabrina?&rdquo; Frigga eagerly nodded, making Loki chuckle. &ldquo;Thanks dear, that&rsquo;s very nice of you.&rdquo; He quickly pecked her lips, before he let her down again. </p><p>The other adults had also dressed up. Tony and Pepper were dressed as salt and pepper, with Tony being the pepper and Pepper being the salt. Bruce was dressed as Superman, while Nat looked like a scientist. Thor wore a devil costume, while Clint looked like a hawk. Peter was dressed as a spider and kept running from Clint, who was chasing him, acting as if he wanted to eat the poor boy.</p><p>Wanda and Vision dressed up as skeletons. Bucky looked like a Zombie and Steve was dressed as the American flag. I laughed at the different costumes.</p><p>Then, Tony clapped and announced that the adults should go to the stations and that the other kids would soon be here. And he was right. Since Loki and I were going to cook with my mom, we waited by the elevator to welcome the kids that were invited. Their parents tagged along, and soon it was super crowded in the living room. Thankfully, the different stations were all over the tower. </p><p>The kids could watch crazy scientist develop new drinks or they could get their faces painted. At another station, they could bob for apples and eat them. Stations like these were everywhere and soon, everyone was busy. But they were also laughing. I smiled while I watched my kids throw cakes at their grandfather, but I soon had to help my mom and Loki again. </p><p>While the kids were playing, we took care of all the scary food. Fingers with nails and fresh blood, poisoned apples, eyeballs and maggots with bacon were all ready within a few hours. Just in time for all the children to arrive. Tired and hungry, they came into the kitchen and got their food, before they sat down in front of the giant screen and watched &lsquo;A Nightmare before Christmas&rsquo;. While they were busy, we started to clean up. The men took care of the heavy stuff, while the women were taking care of all the things that needed to be washed and put away. </p><p>&ldquo;That was so much fun.&rdquo; Nat was grinning from ear to ear, while she was drying a pot. &ldquo;It sure was. I hope we&rsquo;ll do this again.&rdquo; I stood on my tiptoes, trying to reach one of the highest shelves to put a bowl away, but I was just a millimetre to tiny. &ldquo;Let me.&rdquo; Loki suddenly was behind me and took the bowl from my hands. He put it away, before he turned me around and put me on the kitchen counter. &ldquo;Are you finished?&rdquo; He nodded and smiled at me. &ldquo;Perfect! Grab some food if you want to.&rdquo; He nodded again and quickly pecked my lips, before he got himself a plate and filled it with maggots and fingers. He then walked to the living room and sat down with our kids. My mom smiled at me.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you happy?&rdquo; &ldquo;Very.&rdquo; She smiled again and pulled me into a hug. &ldquo;I love you.&rdquo; &ldquo;I love you too, mom.&rdquo; She pecked my cheek, before she shooed me and the others out of the kitchen and told us to enjoy the movie. After some arguing, we left and I sat down beside Loki. He wrapped his arm around my waist and pulled me close. &ldquo;Your parents will take the kids tonight.&rdquo; I looked at him and rolled my eyes, while chuckling. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re the worst.&rdquo; &ldquo;And you love me.&rdquo; I nodded and leaned closer to him. &ldquo;I sure do.&rdquo; I pecked his lips, before I turned back to the screen. His lips pressed against the top of my head, making me smile. </p><p>After the movie was finished, the other kids left. My parents even prepared a gift bag for every single one, filled with sweets. Loki and I took our kids back to our room, where we changed their clothes and got them ready for bed. They were tired but smiling the whole time. They had a lot of fun this night. We brought them to my parents, where they joined Ed in his room. &ldquo;Good night, you two!&rdquo; We wished Tony and Pepper a good night, before we walked back to our own bedroom. Loki had changed, but I was still wearing my costume. </p><p>As we entered our room, I closed the door behind us and leaned against it. Loki didn&rsquo;t notice and kept walking to the bed. Only when he turned around to look at me, did he notice that I was still by the door. &ldquo;What-?&rdquo; Before he could say anymore, I reached up and started to unbutton my costume. The jacket, I was wearing was just hiding my real costume. Green and gold lingerie hugged my body in all the right places. My legs were covered in fishnets and the boots reached up to my knees. I could see Loki swallow hard as I started to walk towards him. I grinned at him seductively and shoved him, making him fall onto the bed. I immediately followed and straddled him. His hands reached up, to grab my waist but I grabbed them and put them back onto the bed. Then, I leaned down. &ldquo;Today, we&rsquo;ll play with my rules.&rdquo; I straightened again and grinned at him. &ldquo;First, no touching, unless I allow it.&rdquo; My hands travelled down his chest, until they reached the hem of his shirt. I then pulled it up and over his head. &ldquo;Second, you have to do everything I say.&rdquo; Loki swallowed, which made me smirk. It was the first time that I managed to get under his skin like that. &ldquo;Third, no cumming until I say so.&rdquo; His breath was heavy and I could already feel his hard on, rubbing against my thigh. </p><p>I slowly started to move against him, watching him moan at the feeling. His hands were grabbing the bedsheet, trying not to touch me. I grinned at the effect I had on him. Slowly, I started to crawl down, until I was kneeling between his legs. I grabbed the hem of his shorts and started to pull it down, freeing his member. I bit my lower lip as I watched the precum glisten on the top. I grabbed Loki&rsquo;s cock and he threw his head back, making me chuckle. I then, leaned forward and licked the precum off the tip, making him arch his back. He moaned loudly and his knuckles were turning white from the force he used to hold on to the sheets. Grinning, I decided to stop the teasing&hellip;for now. </p><p>I took him in my mouth and started to bob my head up and down, switching the pace from time to time. When I felt that he was close to cumming, I let go of him and stood up. &ldquo;W-What are you doing?&rdquo; He stared at me wide eyed. &ldquo;Why? What do you want?&rdquo; I crawled on top of him again and licked my lips. &ldquo;Tell me. What do you want me to do?&rdquo; He released a breath and grunted. &ldquo;Fuck me&hellip;&rdquo; I had to bite the inside of my cheek to keep myself from grinning at him. Instead I tilted my head and frowned at him. &ldquo;What? I couldn&rsquo;t hear you.&rdquo; &ldquo;Fuck me!&rdquo; He roared, still breathing heavy. I grinned. &ldquo;With pleasure.&rdquo;</p><p>I stood up again and took my costume off. I made sure that he could see every little detail perfectly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re killing me.&rdquo; I smiled at him, while I straddled him again. &ldquo;But you love it.&rdquo; I hovered over the top of his cock, slightly grazing it from time to time. &ldquo;Please&hellip;please&hellip;!&rdquo; I let myself sink down on it, moaning at the feeling of being completely filled. Loki&rsquo;s hands automatically went to my waist. I shot him a glare, but quickly nodded. &ldquo;Keep them there.&rdquo; Loki nodded. </p><p>I rose up until only the tip of him was inside of me, then I let myself sink again. I repeated this, until I found the right rhythm. Loki helped me to ride him and I knew that he enjoyed by the way his grip on me tightened with every movement I made. But apparently I was still way to slow. Grunting, Loki sat up, and wrapped his arms around me. He quickly flipped us over, making me lay beneath him. Without missing a beat, he started to thrust inside me. He set such a quick speed, that I didn&rsquo;t even try to keep up with it. Within seconds, he had me writhing beneath him, begging him for release. And he gave me just that. His hands wandered between our bodies and he started to rub my clit, causing me to scream out in pleasure. </p><p>I threw my head back, moaning and yelling in pure bliss. Loki was still above me and grunted as he, himself came deep within me. </p><p>After we&rsquo;d calmed down, Loki pulled me close to him. &ldquo;That was a great surprise.&rdquo; He pressed his lips against mine, and I eagerly responded. But way too soon, we had to pull away to breath again. I pressed my forehead against his and smiled.</p><p>&ldquo;Happy Halloween.&rdquo;</p></p>",
