Steve Rogers thinks she&rsquo;s too stubborn to get it looked at. When he forces her into the infirmary, she comes out a little worse for wear. How will she get anything done now? Maybe a certain super soldier is just going to have to lend a helping hand&hellip;  </p><p><b>Warnings:</b> Avengers: Infinity War Spoilers, slight swearing, fluff</p><p><b>A/N:</b> This is probably one of my weaker pieces to date, but I just felt it had to be written. Toni\u2019s so stubborn, and so is Steve. Please let me know what you think! I\u2019d be greatly appreciative, as always!</p><p><a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Farchiveofourown.org%2Fworks%2F16319627&amp;t=YzFhN2I4N2ZiZTUwN2IxNzBhNjU1ZjNkY2RjMzUxYmY2M2UwMzA1NixkNjY3NDU2MTU1NGM1ZjVmYjYzNDk0ODJkYzlkZWY5ZDg1MmExOWFl\"><i><b>AO3 Link</b></i></a></p><p><i>\u201cShit.\u201d</i></p><p>Pain radiated through Toni Stark\u2019s left arm, and she clutched it instinctively. Every mission she went on, no matter how she tried to baby it, she always ended up somehow screwing with her left arm even more.</p><p>Steve Rogers sat across from her aboard the quinjet as they made their way back to the Avengers compound from an Infinity Stone recovery mission. His baby blue eyes watched her intensively. \u201cDoin\u2019 okay, Stark?\u201d</p><p>She rotated her shoulder cuff, popping a couple joints and wincing. \u201cYeah,\u201d she grunted out, \u201cJust an old battle wound flaring up.\u201d And it was. During one of her initial jaunts as Iron Woman, she took a anti-aircraft shell to her left side. She never really checked herself out, thinking the suit took a brunt of the hit. Add years of missions on top of that, and yeah, she was probably a little worse for wear. </p><p>\u201cWhen we get back to the compound,\u201d he started, nodding towards her arm, \u201cYou\u2019re getting checked out.\u201d</p><p>Her milk chocolate eyes rolled dramatically. \u201cI lived for years with the arc reactor in my chest, Cap. I think I can handle a little arthritis.\u201d</p><p>He scoffed. \u201cI saw those hits you took. That\u2019s more than just a little arthritis, Stark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can handle my own-\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just don\u2019t know when to quit, do you, Toni?\u201d he snarled, effectively silencing her before he leaned back in his seat. \u201cYou\u2019re getting checked out, and that\u2019s an order.\u201d</p><p>That last sentence came out as a low growl, causing the Iron Woman\u2019s eyebrow to quirk up. He was certainly adamant on her being seen. He never used that tone with her, his \u201cdon\u2019t mess with me; I\u2019m Captain America\u201d tone. His barking, however, just made her want to test the waters and not get checked out even more.</p><p>The moment they landed, however, she wasn\u2019t given much of a choice. Steve grabbed her right arm and all but dragged her into the infirmary. She figured he was going to leave, satisfied that he got her in there, but no. The super soldier of course stayed, because he knew Toni too well and knew she\u2019d take off.</p><p>They both emerged from the infirmary two hours after entering, Toni\u2019s left arm in a sling and the Iron Woman suit left in the middle of the room. Steve walked her back to her suite door like the gentleman he was, but she couldn\u2019t help but glare at the captain, raising her bent ligament to make a point. \u201cI\u2019m incapacitated now. Are you satisfied, Captain?\u201d</p><p>She fumbled around in her right pocket for her keys, but they were nowhere to be found, which meant they were in her left side. She went to stretch out her chicken wing when she huffed in aggravation.</p><p>Steve reached into her left pocket where one key was sticking out, clutching them as soon as they slipped into his massive palm. His other hand nudged Toni out of the way as he slid one of the keys into the lock. The tumbler system clicked, so he jiggled the handle and the door opened. He gestured the woman inside, following in close pursuit without saying a word.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t have to do that. I could\u2019ve gotten my own damn door, especially if I wasn\u2019t in a freakin\u2019 sling! Rogers,\u201d she hissed, pouting at the super soldier who was pacing through her suite, \u201cI\u2019m literally going to struggle to do everything. I\u2019m not even going to be able to wash the filth and sweat out of my hair.\u201d</p><p>The blond disappeared down a small hallway and into her bedroom. When he didn\u2019t immediately return, Toni padded down the corridor after him. The sound of water rushing from her faucet piqued her curiosity. \u201cNow you\u2019re just invading my privacy. What the hell are you even doing?\u201d</p><p>He rounded the corner from the bathroom, and Toni couldn\u2019t help but gawk at the sight in front of her. He had peeled the top layer of his navy blue suit away, revealing a white v-neck t-shirt while still leaving his pants and boots in place. His shooting gloves had been discarded, replaced with a burgundy hand towel as he wrung his hands dry. A small smirk played at the corner of his lips.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the genius,\u201d he quipped, cocking his head to the side. \u201cWhat\u2019s it sound like?\u201d</p><p>Her face flushed slightly, casting her eyes down away from Steve. \u201cIf I weren\u2019t in this sling, you wouldn\u2019t have to do this either.\u201d</p><p>His hair trembled as his shook his head, disappearing again behind the bathroom door. The handles of the bathtub squeaked, meaning the tub must have been filled to the right height for the captain.</p><p>Her feet propelled her forward into the spacious bathroom as Steve pushed himself to his feet. She kind of stood there gazing at him, expecting him to get the hint and give her a little privacy. Instead, he closed the gap between them, his calloused fingers tugging at the hem of her t-shirt. Her body went rigid, and his baby blue hues glanced at her.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>She cleared her throat, eyes locked on the hands still on her shirt hem. Not that she didn\u2019t want him to continue. She just didn\u2019t think he\u2019d be so bold with something like that. \u201cUhhh&hellip;whatcha doin\u2019 there, Cap?\u201d</p><p>He cocked his head to the side. \u201cWell, considering you keep complaining about that damn sling, I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019m helping you get a bath.\u201d He dropped his hands away and grabbed his shooting gloves and suit jacket from the counter. \u201cI can go get Nat if you want, but I know she\u2019s getting herself looked at too and is training at the moment. You\u2019re free to wait until she\u2019s finished&hellip;when the water is icy cold.\u201d</p><p>Toni raised her eyebrow quizzically. \u201cSince when did sweet, chivalrous Capsicle become so brazen?\u201d</p><p>A wider smile tugged at his lips this time, making his beard move ever so slightly. \u201cSince I got a second chance with a certain billionaire on possibly borrowed time.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t help but snort at his response as she rotated on her heel, her back to him. When he didn\u2019t immediately return to her, she twisted her head. \u201cYou didn\u2019t have to put me in a sling to get me naked, Cap,\u201d she cooed. \u201cAll you had to do was ask nicely.\u201d</p><p>His cheeks turned crimson red as he set his uniform back down on the counter. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean it in that way. I\u2019m the reason you\u2019re in that sling to begin with. The least I can do is try to help you.\u201d</p><p>Moving closer, he hovered over her, fingers tugging upwards on the hem of her t-shirt and helping her get it off over the right side of her body. The left side, with the sling, was a bit more of a challenge. He had to stretch the arm hole a little bit more to help get her arm out.When she was finally out, her fingers undid the button of her jeans and pushed them past her hips. With a little shimmy, they pooled at her feet. Kicking off her shoes was the only primary task left, and at least she was able to do that with ease.</p><p>With her shoes off, she was left in nothing but her lacy wine-colored bra and matching cheeky panties in front of the Captain. Her face heated, and she instantly tried to hide it. She was embarrassed by her response. If she were with anyone else, she\u2019d have more confidence. But because it was Steve, she felt like a lovesick teenager again.</p><p>His lips interrupted her thoughts, pressing against the area between her shoulder blades, his fingers tickling against the flesh of her back as they hooked under her bra band. He made quick work of the delicate fabric, kissing each of her shoulders as soon as the straps fell to the wayside. He decided to let her shimmy herself out of her panties before he pressed his lips to her ear. \u201cGo get in the tub. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p><p>He slid out the bathroom door and was gentlemanly enough not to peek at her full frontal display.</p><p>Toni let out a small sigh before turning to step in the tub. When her foot hit the water, she hissed. The water was boiling. Did that big oaf even have the best internal thermometer?</p><p>She glanced up and saw his shadow moving closer, so she sunk into the water quickly while still keeping her left arm and the sling out of it. Because of how quick she slithered in, she didn\u2019t have much time to get adjusted to the heat, causing her features to twist in discomfort. Before Steve rounded the corner, she crossed her right arm right in front of her chest and tilted her legs away from where the soldier would be, attempting to cover the more intimate parts of her.</p><p>He rounded the corner and sank to his knees beside the bathtub, studying her. \u201cToo hot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToni.\u201d</p><p>She fidgeted in the water a bit. \u201cNow that I\u2019m used to it, not so much. It was scorching when I first climbed in, though.\u201d</p><p>He snorted. \u201cWould you have preferred an ice bath? I can tell you from personal experience that too much heat is better.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t help but chuckle. \u201cLook who\u2019s making jokes now. Nah. Save the ice for after the bath. Makes temperature play more fun,\u201d she purred, wiggling her eyebrows.</p><p>There was a sigh of minimal aggravation in his throat as he rose to grab the shower head before taking his place on his knees once again. The only response Toni knew how to give was a smart one.</p><p>\u201cOooh,\u201d she cooed, leaning her head against the back of the tub and winking at the super soldier, \u201cA little bath play to get me warmed up? Why, Captain, you certainly are being brazen tonight.\u201d</p><p>His face was as burgundy as the hand towel he had used, now strewn across the vanity counter. \u201cJesus, Toni. You just don\u2019t know when to quit,\u201d he breathed. His fingers tugged at her caramel strands before cupping her face. \u201cI\u2019m going to need you to help me here. Lean forward so I can wash your hair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to do this, Steve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but I want to. Lean forward,\u201d he ordered again, patting her right shoulder to coax her into an upright position. His fingers then reached across her to the comfort strap of the sling, lift it and pulling it over her head before sliding the contraption off altogether. \u201cDon\u2019t want to get this wet.\u201d</p><p>Toni\u2019s first instinct was to stretch the arm, but she winced as pain shot up into her shoulder. She rested her elbow on the left side of the tub as she leaned forward like Steve instructed.</p><p>The captain\u2019s lips formed a straight line. \u201cSeriously? Just pretend it\u2019s still in the sling while I do this. Don\u2019t make it any worse, doll.\u201d</p><p>That sentiment made her heart leap a little bit, but she grumbled something under her breath as he turned on the shower head, a gentle stream of water pouring out. His hand brushed against her forehead, tilting her head back. She sucked in a breath, prepared for the same scalding temperature as her bath water was. Rather surprised when the water cascading down her scalp was more on the warm side, she couldn\u2019t help but melt into it.</p><p>A minuscule smile danced across Steve\u2019s lips as his free hand slid under Toni\u2019s hair, supporting it to make sure he got every strand wet. When he was satisfied with the tips, he moved his attention to her roots, gingerly pushing her head to the left and then the right to ensure he covered every millimeter with water. He even lifted her soaked hair to get the underside and the back of her neck.</p><p>When he was satisfied that her hair was damp enough, he turned off the shower head and set it to the side, stretching across the tub to reach an orange bottle. A dollop of the creamy white product poured into a button on his hand before he returned the bottle to its original position. Rubbing his palms together, he lathered up his hands before immediately going to work on her scalp, fingertips massaging the soap into her hair.</p><p>The sensation was delightful to Toni. It had been a long while since she actually went to the salon, and Steve was proving to be quite the expert. She let out a sharp exhale through her nose, then whined when Steve\u2019s fingers stopped.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, doll?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothin\u2019. Just feels good.\u201d</p><p>There was a rumble in his chest, a soft laugh as he continued to work the soap through her roots, down her strands. Finished with his work, his fingers curled around the shower head again.</p><p>She let out a tiny groan as he went back and washed out the shampoo. He didn\u2019t need to push her head to either side. She rolled it around, hoping that she was making his job a little bit easier.</p><p>When he turned off the shower head again, he pressed his lips to her forehead. \u201cFeel better?\u201d</p><p>She murmured an affirmative before a smirk tugged at her lips. \u201cA bit, but you forgot the conditioner.\u201d Yeah, she could\u2019ve gotten by without it, but that would mean the pampering would stop.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t have that now, can we?\u201d His fingers curled around her sopping mane and twisted ever so lightly, letting the excess water drain before he reached over for another bottle on the edge of the tub. He repeated the same process as he had with the shampoo, but this time, he paid more attention to the dangling strands rather than her scalp. Task completed, he pushed himself to his feet and rummaged in one of the nearby cupboards.</p><p>She craned her neck slightly. \u201cWhat\u2019re you looking for?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t respond as he continued to rummage. It was a minute before he stood upright again and turned to the tub, dropping a beige washcloth in the water while holding on to a large navy blue towel. \u201cYou need to let that sit a minute, right? Why don\u2019t you go ahead and wash off a little bit more and I\u2019ll come back in a few to finish up?\u201d</p><p>Toni was about to argue before Steve set the towel down and retreated into her bedroom.</p><p>She huffed, her fingers curling around the washcloth and wringing it out as best as she could before draping it over the side of the tub. Swinging her right arm across her torso more freely, she grabbed a bottle of lavender soap and squeezed out a drop before placing the bottle in its empty spot. Folding the cloth over delicately, she rubbed her fingers together against the fabric to try to create a lather. When she was sure the lather was sufficient enough, she rubbed the cloth against her face, scrubbing her cheeks, T-zone and the back of her neck. She continued down her body, being very ginger with her left arm. Rising just a bit so that her chest and abdomen were barely out of the water, she washed those bits too. Her legs proved to be a bit more challenging, but she made do. With her body now lathered up, she rinsed out the washcloth to get the soap out of it before she retraced her bath, scrubbing just a little harder to ensure every sud was off her body.</p><p>Just as she finished up with her legs, Steve appeared in the doorway, a large folded silver fuzzy blanket in his arms. \u201cAll taken care of, Toni?\u201d</p><p>She smirked playfully. \u201cIn a way, I suppose you could say that.\u201d</p><p>He scoffed and dropped to his knees again, reaching for the shower head one more. The water dribbled over her scalp and down her strands as his fingers tugged as tenderly as they could, trying to get out all of the conditioner. After a few minutes under the stream, he stopped and returned the shower head to its original position then ducked down to pull the plug on the drain. Rotating on his heel, he turned to give Toni just the smallest amount of privacy as he unfurled the enormous blue towel, getting it ready for her to step into.</p><p>She waited until most of the water was drained before she considered standing. Since her left arm was already braced against the tub, she didn\u2019t see any harm in putting a little bit of weight on it to stabilize herself. She overestimated her capabilities, and her elbow slid into the tub, hitting the porcelain bottom with a thud and sending a stabbing pain shooting up her arm. \u201cSonova mother-\u201d</p><p>What happened next was rather a blur. Steve rapidly rotated on his heel and tossed the towel over Toni\u2019s body before lifting her out of the tub bridal style. He tilted his body slightly, sliding her out of his arms and onto her feet before snatching the towel away to dry off her neck and left arm. The sling was back across her body in the next instant, and he handed the towel back to her. \u201cToni, you have got to be more careful.\u201d</p><p>She blushed furiously, keeping the towel as fanned out as she could while drying off. \u201cJesus, Steve. I\u2019m Iron Woman, not a porcelain doll. It was just an accident.\u201d</p><p>He rotated to her backside, which she realized was on full display, causing her to blush harder. The towel slipped through her fingers as he tugged it away, drying off what she would allow him to. \u201cI just worry about you. After everything that\u2019s happened, I am allowed to do that, y\u2019know.\u201d</p><p>She was about to sass him about that remark not being fair when he dropped the towel and leaned over to grab the huge fuzzy blanket. She could feel him fanning it out behind her. The fabric then hugged against her body, encasing her in its (and Steve\u2019s) warmth. She clutched at the front of the blanket to make sure it stayed closed. A hum trilled from her throat as she leaned back against the super soldier.</p><p>\u201cC\u2019mon,\u201d he said, tapping her back to make her step forward. \u201cLet\u2019s get you to bed.\u201d</p><p>This time she didn\u2019t fight him. Bed actually sounded relaxing and she could probably use the sleep. She sauntered into the bedroom and crawled onto the bed. \u201cThanks for looking out for me, Steve,\u201d she mumbled as she snuggled in the blanket further, closing her eyes. </p><p>There was a soft guffaw on the other side of the bed followed by a dip, causing her eyes to pop open. The super soldier swung his legs up and tilted his torso back so he was resting himself on the pillow beside her. \u201cYou can\u2019t get rid of me that easily, Stark.\u201d</p><p>His left arm extended, inviting her in for snuggles. She found herself wiggling in closer, tucking herself tight against his side. Thinking about the situation, she snorted.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s funny?\u201d</p><p>She grinned against the fabric of his t-shirt. \u201cGuess now I can say I got Captain America into my bed, huh?\u201d</p><p>He groaned, right hand covering his eyes. \u201cOh for the love of God, Toni-\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2018I may have got Cap in bed, but he\u2019s the one who got me naked.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cStark-\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2018He used the pretense of my injured arm to get me naked. Isn\u2019t he such a romantic?\u2019\u201d</p><p>In an instant, his lips were on hers in an effort to shut her up. His teeth tugged gently at her lower lip in warning before he pulled away. \u201cYou just don\u2019t know when to quit, do you, Toni?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she drawled out, shimmying up a little bit and draping her bent arm over his chest with a wink. \u201cI\u2019ll tell ya one thing though, Cap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s sure as hell one way to get me started.\u201d</p>",

Every mission she went on, no matter how she tried to baby it, she always ended up somehow screwing with her left arm even more.</p><p>Steve Rogers sat across from her aboard the quinjet as they made their way back to the Avengers compound from an Infinity Stone recovery mission. His baby blue eyes watched her intensively. \u201cDoin\u2019 okay, Stark?\u201d</p><p>She rotated her shoulder cuff, popping a couple joints and wincing. \u201cYeah,\u201d she grunted out, \u201cJust an old battle wound flaring up.\u201d And it was. During one of her initial jaunts as Iron Woman, she took a anti-aircraft shell to her left side. She never really checked herself out, thinking the suit took a brunt of the hit. Add years of missions on top of that, and yeah, she was probably a little worse for wear. </p><p>\u201cWhen we get back to the compound,\u201d he started, nodding towards her arm, \u201cYou\u2019re getting checked out.\u201d</p><p>Her milk chocolate eyes rolled dramatically. \u201cI lived for years with the arc reactor in my chest, Cap. I think I can handle a little arthritis.\u201d</p><p>He scoffed. \u201cI saw those hits you took. That\u2019s more than just a little arthritis, Stark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can handle my own-\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just don\u2019t know when to quit, do you, Toni?\u201d he snarled, effectively silencing her before he leaned back in his seat. \u201cYou\u2019re getting checked out, and that\u2019s an order.\u201d</p><p>That last sentence came out as a low growl, causing the Iron Woman\u2019s eyebrow to quirk up. He was certainly adamant on her being seen. He never used that tone with her, his \u201cdon\u2019t mess with me; I\u2019m Captain America\u201d tone. His barking, however, just made her want to test the waters and not get checked out even more.</p><p>The moment they landed, however, she wasn\u2019t given much of a choice. Steve grabbed her right arm and all but dragged her into the infirmary. She figured he was going to leave, satisfied that he got her in there, but no. The super soldier of course stayed, because he knew Toni too well and knew she\u2019d take off.</p><p>They both emerged from the infirmary two hours after entering, Toni\u2019s left arm in a sling and the Iron Woman suit left in the middle of the room. Steve walked her back to her suite door like the gentleman he was, but she couldn\u2019t help but glare at the captain, raising her bent ligament to make a point. \u201cI\u2019m incapacitated now. Are you satisfied, Captain?\u201d</p><p>She fumbled around in her right pocket for her keys, but they were nowhere to be found, which meant they were in her left side. She went to stretch out her chicken wing when she huffed in aggravation.</p><p>Steve reached into her left pocket where one key was sticking out, clutching them as soon as they slipped into his massive palm. His other hand nudged Toni out of the way as he slid one of the keys into the lock. The tumbler system clicked, so he jiggled the handle and the door opened. He gestured the woman inside, following in close pursuit without saying a word.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t have to do that. I could\u2019ve gotten my own damn door, especially if I wasn\u2019t in a freakin\u2019 sling! Rogers,\u201d she hissed, pouting at the super soldier who was pacing through her suite, \u201cI\u2019m literally going to struggle to do everything. I\u2019m not even going to be able to wash the filth and sweat out of my hair.\u201d</p><p>The blond disappeared down a small hallway and into her bedroom. When he didn\u2019t immediately return, Toni padded down the corridor after him. The sound of water rushing from her faucet piqued her curiosity. \u201cNow you\u2019re just invading my privacy. What the hell are you even doing?\u201d</p><p>He rounded the corner from the bathroom, and Toni couldn\u2019t help but gawk at the sight in front of her. He had peeled the top layer of his navy blue suit away, revealing a white v-neck t-shirt while still leaving his pants and boots in place. His shooting gloves had been discarded, replaced with a burgundy hand towel as he wrung his hands dry. A small smirk played at the corner of his lips.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the genius,\u201d he quipped, cocking his head to the side. \u201cWhat\u2019s it sound like?\u201d</p><p>Her face flushed slightly, casting her eyes down away from Steve. \u201cIf I weren\u2019t in this sling, you wouldn\u2019t have to do this either.\u201d</p><p>His hair trembled as his shook his head, disappearing again behind the bathroom door. The handles of the bathtub squeaked, meaning the tub must have been filled to the right height for the captain.</p><p>Her feet propelled her forward into the spacious bathroom as Steve pushed himself to his feet. She kind of stood there gazing at him, expecting him to get the hint and give her a little privacy. Instead, he closed the gap between them, his calloused fingers tugging at the hem of her t-shirt. Her body went rigid, and his baby blue hues glanced at her.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>She cleared her throat, eyes locked on the hands still on her shirt hem. Not that she didn\u2019t want him to continue. She just didn\u2019t think he\u2019d be so bold with something like that. \u201cUhhh\u2026whatcha doin\u2019 there, Cap?\u201d</p><p>He cocked his head to the side. \u201cWell, considering you keep complaining about that damn sling, I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019m helping you get a bath.\u201d He dropped his hands away and grabbed his shooting gloves and suit jacket from the counter. \u201cI can go get Nat if you want, but I know she\u2019s getting herself looked at too and is training at the moment. You\u2019re free to wait until she\u2019s finished\u2026when the water is icy cold.\u201d</p><p>Toni raised her eyebrow quizzically. \u201cSince when did sweet, chivalrous Capsicle become so brazen?\u201d</p><p>A wider smile tugged at his lips this time, making his beard move ever so slightly. \u201cSince I got a second chance with a certain billionaire on possibly borrowed time.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t help but snort at his response as she rotated on her heel, her back to him. When he didn\u2019t immediately return to her, she twisted her head. \u201cYou didn\u2019t have to put me in a sling to get me naked, Cap,\u201d she cooed. \u201cAll you had to do was ask nicely.\u201d</p><p>His cheeks turned crimson red as he set his uniform back down on the counter. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean it in that way. I\u2019m the reason you\u2019re in that sling to begin with. The least I can do is try to help you.\u201d</p><p>Moving closer, he hovered over her, fingers tugging upwards on the hem of her t-shirt and helping her get it off over the right side of her body. The left side, with the sling, was a bit more of a challenge. He had to stretch the arm hole a little bit more to help get her arm out.When she was finally out, her fingers undid the button of her jeans and pushed them past her hips. With a little shimmy, they pooled at her feet. Kicking off her shoes was the only primary task left, and at least she was able to do that with ease.</p><p>With her shoes off, she was left in nothing but her lacy wine-colored bra and matching cheeky panties in front of the Captain. Her face heated, and she instantly tried to hide it. She was embarrassed by her response. If she were with anyone else, she\u2019d have more confidence. But because it was Steve, she felt like a lovesick teenager again.</p><p>His lips interrupted her thoughts, pressing against the area between her shoulder blades, his fingers tickling against the flesh of her back as they hooked under her bra band. He made quick work of the delicate fabric, kissing each of her shoulders as soon as the straps fell to the wayside. He decided to let her shimmy herself out of her panties before he pressed his lips to her ear. \u201cGo get in the tub. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p><p>He slid out the bathroom door and was gentlemanly enough not to peek at her full frontal display.</p><p>Toni let out a small sigh before turning to step in the tub. When her foot hit the water, she hissed. The water was boiling. Did that big oaf even have the best internal thermometer?</p><p>She glanced up and saw his shadow moving closer, so she sunk into the water quickly while still keeping her left arm and the sling out of it. Because of how quick she slithered in, she didn\u2019t have much time to get adjusted to the heat, causing her features to twist in discomfort. Before Steve rounded the corner, she crossed her right arm right in front of her chest and tilted her legs away from where the soldier would be, attempting to cover the more intimate parts of her.</p><p>He rounded the corner and sank to his knees beside the bathtub, studying her. \u201cToo hot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToni.\u201d</p><p>She fidgeted in the water a bit. \u201cNow that I\u2019m used to it, not so much. It was scorching when I first climbed in, though.\u201d</p><p>He snorted. \u201cWould you have preferred an ice bath? I can tell you from personal experience that too much heat is better.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t help but chuckle. \u201cLook who\u2019s making jokes now. Nah. Save the ice for after the bath. Makes temperature play more fun,\u201d she purred, wiggling her eyebrows.</p><p>There was a sigh of minimal aggravation in his throat as he rose to grab the shower head before taking his place on his knees once again. The only response Toni knew how to give was a smart one.</p><p>\u201cOooh,\u201d she cooed, leaning her head against the back of the tub and winking at the super soldier, \u201cA little bath play to get me warmed up? Why, Captain, you certainly are being brazen tonight.\u201d</p><p>His face was as burgundy as the hand towel he had used, now strewn across the vanity counter. \u201cJesus, Toni. You just don\u2019t know when to quit,\u201d he breathed. His fingers tugged at her caramel strands before cupping her face. \u201cI\u2019m going to need you to help me here. Lean forward so I can wash your hair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to do this, Steve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but I want to. Lean forward,\u201d he ordered again, patting her right shoulder to coax her into an upright position. His fingers then reached across her to the comfort strap of the sling, lift it and pulling it over her head before sliding the contraption off altogether. \u201cDon\u2019t want to get this wet.\u201d</p><p>Toni\u2019s first instinct was to stretch the arm, but she winced as pain shot up into her shoulder. She rested her elbow on the left side of the tub as she leaned forward like Steve instructed.</p><p>The captain\u2019s lips formed a straight line. \u201cSeriously? Just pretend it\u2019s still in the sling while I do this. Don\u2019t make it any worse, doll.\u201d</p><p>That sentiment made her heart leap a little bit, but she grumbled something under her breath as he turned on the shower head, a gentle stream of water pouring out. His hand brushed against her forehead, tilting her head back. She sucked in a breath, prepared for the same scalding temperature as her bath water was. Rather surprised when the water cascading down her scalp was more on the warm side, she couldn\u2019t help but melt into it.</p><p>A minuscule smile danced across Steve\u2019s lips as his free hand slid under Toni\u2019s hair, supporting it to make sure he got every strand wet. When he was satisfied with the tips, he moved his attention to her roots, gingerly pushing her head to the left and then the right to ensure he covered every millimeter with water. He even lifted her soaked hair to get the underside and the back of her neck.</p><p>When he was satisfied that her hair was damp enough, he turned off the shower head and set it to the side, stretching across the tub to reach an orange bottle. A dollop of the creamy white product poured into a button on his hand before he returned the bottle to its original position. Rubbing his palms together, he lathered up his hands before immediately going to work on her scalp, fingertips massaging the soap into her hair.</p><p>The sensation was delightful to Toni. It had been a long while since she actually went to the salon, and Steve was proving to be quite the expert. She let out a sharp exhale through her nose, then whined when Steve\u2019s fingers stopped.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, doll?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothin\u2019. Just feels good.\u201d</p><p>There was a rumble in his chest, a soft laugh as he continued to work the soap through her roots, down her strands. Finished with his work, his fingers curled around the shower head again.</p><p>She let out a tiny groan as he went back and washed out the shampoo. He didn\u2019t need to push her head to either side. She rolled it around, hoping that she was making his job a little bit easier.</p><p>When he turned off the shower head again, he pressed his lips to her forehead. \u201cFeel better?\u201d</p><p>She murmured an affirmative before a smirk tugged at her lips. \u201cA bit, but you forgot the conditioner.\u201d Yeah, she could\u2019ve gotten by without it, but that would mean the pampering would stop.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t have that now, can we?\u201d His fingers curled around her sopping mane and twisted ever so lightly, letting the excess water drain before he reached over for another bottle on the edge of the tub. He repeated the same process as he had with the shampoo, but this time, he paid more attention to the dangling strands rather than her scalp. Task completed, he pushed himself to his feet and rummaged in one of the nearby cupboards.</p><p>She craned her neck slightly. \u201cWhat\u2019re you looking for?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t respond as he continued to rummage. It was a minute before he stood upright again and turned to the tub, dropping a beige washcloth in the water while holding on to a large navy blue towel. \u201cYou need to let that sit a minute, right? Why don\u2019t you go ahead and wash off a little bit more and I\u2019ll come back in a few to finish up?\u201d</p><p>Toni was about to argue before Steve set the towel down and retreated into her bedroom.</p><p>She huffed, her fingers curling around the washcloth and wringing it out as best as she could before draping it over the side of the tub. Swinging her right arm across her torso more freely, she grabbed a bottle of lavender soap and squeezed out a drop before placing the bottle in its empty spot. Folding the cloth over delicately, she rubbed her fingers together against the fabric to try to create a lather. When she was sure the lather was sufficient enough, she rubbed the cloth against her face, scrubbing her cheeks, T-zone and the back of her neck. She continued down her body, being very ginger with her left arm. Rising just a bit so that her chest and abdomen were barely out of the water, she washed those bits too. Her legs proved to be a bit more challenging, but she made do. With her body now lathered up, she rinsed out the washcloth to get the soap out of it before she retraced her bath, scrubbing just a little harder to ensure every sud was off her body.</p><p>Just as she finished up with her legs, Steve appeared in the doorway, a large folded silver fuzzy blanket in his arms. \u201cAll taken care of, Toni?\u201d</p><p>She smirked playfully. \u201cIn a way, I suppose you could say that.\u201d</p><p>He scoffed and dropped to his knees again, reaching for the shower head one more. The water dribbled over her scalp and down her strands as his fingers tugged as tenderly as they could, trying to get out all of the conditioner. After a few minutes under the stream, he stopped and returned the shower head to its original position then ducked down to pull the plug on the drain. Rotating on his heel, he turned to give Toni just the smallest amount of privacy as he unfurled the enormous blue towel, getting it ready for her to step into.</p><p>She waited until most of the water was drained before she considered standing. Since her left arm was already braced against the tub, she didn\u2019t see any harm in putting a little bit of weight on it to stabilize herself. She overestimated her capabilities, and her elbow slid into the tub, hitting the porcelain bottom with a thud and sending a stabbing pain shooting up her arm. \u201cSonova mother-\u201d</p><p>What happened next was rather a blur. Steve rapidly rotated on his heel and tossed the towel over Toni\u2019s body before lifting her out of the tub bridal style. He tilted his body slightly, sliding her out of his arms and onto her feet before snatching the towel away to dry off her neck and left arm. The sling was back across her body in the next instant, and he handed the towel back to her. \u201cToni, you have got to be more careful.\u201d</p><p>She blushed furiously, keeping the towel as fanned out as she could while drying off. \u201cJesus, Steve. I\u2019m Iron Woman, not a porcelain doll. It was just an accident.\u201d</p><p>He rotated to her backside, which she realized was on full display, causing her to blush harder. The towel slipped through her fingers as he tugged it away, drying off what she would allow him to. \u201cI just worry about you. After everything that\u2019s happened, I am allowed to do that, y\u2019know.\u201d</p><p>She was about to sass him about that remark not being fair when he dropped the towel and leaned over to grab the huge fuzzy blanket. She could feel him fanning it out behind her. The fabric then hugged against her body, encasing her in its (and Steve\u2019s) warmth. She clutched at the front of the blanket to make sure it stayed closed. A hum trilled from her throat as she leaned back against the super soldier.</p><p>\u201cC\u2019mon,\u201d he said, tapping her back to make her step forward. \u201cLet\u2019s get you to bed.\u201d</p><p>This time she didn\u2019t fight him. Bed actually sounded relaxing and she could probably use the sleep. She sauntered into the bedroom and crawled onto the bed. \u201cThanks for looking out for me, Steve,\u201d she mumbled as she snuggled in the blanket further, closing her eyes. </p><p>There was a soft guffaw on the other side of the bed followed by a dip, causing her eyes to pop open. The super soldier swung his legs up and tilted his torso back so he was resting himself on the pillow beside her. \u201cYou can\u2019t get rid of me that easily, Stark.\u201d</p><p>His left arm extended, inviting her in for snuggles. She found herself wiggling in closer, tucking herself tight against his side. Thinking about the situation, she snorted.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s funny?\u201d</p><p>She grinned against the fabric of his t-shirt. \u201cGuess now I can say I got Captain America into my bed, huh?\u201d</p><p>He groaned, right hand covering his eyes. \u201cOh for the love of God, Toni-\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2018I may have got Cap in bed, but he\u2019s the one who got me naked.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cStark-\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2018He used the pretense of my injured arm to get me naked. Isn\u2019t he such a romantic?\u2019\u201d</p><p>In an instant, his lips were on hers in an effort to shut her up. His teeth tugged gently at her lower lip in warning before he pulled away. \u201cYou just don\u2019t know when to quit, do you, Toni?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she drawled out, shimmying up a little bit and draping her bent arm over his chest with a wink. \u201cI\u2019ll tell ya one thing though, Cap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s sure as hell one way to get me started.\u201d</p></p>",

Steve Rogers thinks she\u2019s too stubborn to get it looked at. When he forces her into the infirmary, she comes out a little worse for wear. How will she get anything done now? Maybe a certain super soldier is just going to have to lend a helping hand\u2026  </p><p><b>Warnings:</b> Avengers: Infinity War Spoilers, slight swearing, fluff</p><p><b>A/N:</b> This is probably one of my weaker pieces to date, but I just felt it had to be written. Toni\u2019s so stubborn, and so is Steve. Please let me know what you think! I\u2019d be greatly appreciative, as always!</p><p><a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Farchiveofourown.org%2Fworks%2F16319627&amp;t=YzFhN2I4N2ZiZTUwN2IxNzBhNjU1ZjNkY2RjMzUxYmY2M2UwMzA1NixkNjY3NDU2MTU1NGM1ZjVmYjYzNDk0ODJkYzlkZWY5ZDg1MmExOWFl\"><i><b>AO3 Link</b></i></a></p><p><i>\u201cShit.\u201d</i></p><p>Pain radiated through Toni Stark\u2019s left arm, and she clutched it instinctively. Every mission she went on, no matter how she tried to baby it, she always ended up somehow screwing with her left arm even more.</p><p>Steve Rogers sat across from her aboard the quinjet as they made their way back to the Avengers compound from an Infinity Stone recovery mission. His baby blue eyes watched her intensively. \u201cDoin\u2019 okay, Stark?\u201d</p><p>She rotated her shoulder cuff, popping a couple joints and wincing. \u201cYeah,\u201d she grunted out, \u201cJust an old battle wound flaring up.\u201d And it was. During one of her initial jaunts as Iron Woman, she took a anti-aircraft shell to her left side. She never really checked herself out, thinking the suit took a brunt of the hit. Add years of missions on top of that, and yeah, she was probably a little worse for wear. </p><p>\u201cWhen we get back to the compound,\u201d he started, nodding towards her arm, \u201cYou\u2019re getting checked out.\u201d</p><p>Her milk chocolate eyes rolled dramatically. \u201cI lived for years with the arc reactor in my chest, Cap. I think I can handle a little arthritis.\u201d</p><p>He scoffed. \u201cI saw those hits you took. That\u2019s more than just a little arthritis, Stark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can handle my own-\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just don\u2019t know when to quit, do you, Toni?\u201d he snarled, effectively silencing her before he leaned back in his seat. \u201cYou\u2019re getting checked out, and that\u2019s an order.\u201d</p><p>That last sentence came out as a low growl, causing the Iron Woman\u2019s eyebrow to quirk up. He was certainly adamant on her being seen. He never used that tone with her, his \u201cdon\u2019t mess with me; I\u2019m Captain America\u201d tone. His barking, however, just made her want to test the waters and not get checked out even more.</p><p>The moment they landed, however, she wasn\u2019t given much of a choice. Steve grabbed her right arm and all but dragged her into the infirmary. She figured he was going to leave, satisfied that he got her in there, but no. The super soldier of course stayed, because he knew Toni too well and knew she\u2019d take off.</p><p>They both emerged from the infirmary two hours after entering, Toni\u2019s left arm in a sling and the Iron Woman suit left in the middle of the room. Steve walked her back to her suite door like the gentleman he was, but she couldn\u2019t help but glare at the captain, raising her bent ligament to make a point. \u201cI\u2019m incapacitated now. Are you satisfied, Captain?\u201d</p><p>She fumbled around in her right pocket for her keys, but they were nowhere to be found, which meant they were in her left side. She went to stretch out her chicken wing when she huffed in aggravation.</p><p>Steve reached into her left pocket where one key was sticking out, clutching them as soon as they slipped into his massive palm. His other hand nudged Toni out of the way as he slid one of the keys into the lock. The tumbler system clicked, so he jiggled the handle and the door opened. He gestured the woman inside, following in close pursuit without saying a word.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t have to do that. I could\u2019ve gotten my own damn door, especially if I wasn\u2019t in a freakin\u2019 sling! Rogers,\u201d she hissed, pouting at the super soldier who was pacing through her suite, \u201cI\u2019m literally going to struggle to do everything. I\u2019m not even going to be able to wash the filth and sweat out of my hair.\u201d</p><p>The blond disappeared down a small hallway and into her bedroom. When he didn\u2019t immediately return, Toni padded down the corridor after him. The sound of water rushing from her faucet piqued her curiosity. \u201cNow you\u2019re just invading my privacy. What the hell are you even doing?\u201d</p><p>He rounded the corner from the bathroom, and Toni couldn\u2019t help but gawk at the sight in front of her. He had peeled the top layer of his navy blue suit away, revealing a white v-neck t-shirt while still leaving his pants and boots in place. His shooting gloves had been discarded, replaced with a burgundy hand towel as he wrung his hands dry. A small smirk played at the corner of his lips.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the genius,\u201d he quipped, cocking his head to the side. \u201cWhat\u2019s it sound like?\u201d</p><p>Her face flushed slightly, casting her eyes down away from Steve. \u201cIf I weren\u2019t in this sling, you wouldn\u2019t have to do this either.\u201d</p><p>His hair trembled as his shook his head, disappearing again behind the bathroom door. The handles of the bathtub squeaked, meaning the tub must have been filled to the right height for the captain.</p><p>Her feet propelled her forward into the spacious bathroom as Steve pushed himself to his feet. She kind of stood there gazing at him, expecting him to get the hint and give her a little privacy. Instead, he closed the gap between them, his calloused fingers tugging at the hem of her t-shirt. Her body went rigid, and his baby blue hues glanced at her.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>She cleared her throat, eyes locked on the hands still on her shirt hem. Not that she didn\u2019t want him to continue. She just didn\u2019t think he\u2019d be so bold with something like that. \u201cUhhh\u2026whatcha doin\u2019 there, Cap?\u201d</p><p>He cocked his head to the side. \u201cWell, considering you keep complaining about that damn sling, I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019m helping you get a bath.\u201d He dropped his hands away and grabbed his shooting gloves and suit jacket from the counter. \u201cI can go get Nat if you want, but I know she\u2019s getting herself looked at too and is training at the moment. You\u2019re free to wait until she\u2019s finished\u2026when the water is icy cold.\u201d</p><p>Toni raised her eyebrow quizzically. \u201cSince when did sweet, chivalrous Capsicle become so brazen?\u201d</p><p>A wider smile tugged at his lips this time, making his beard move ever so slightly. \u201cSince I got a second chance with a certain billionaire on possibly borrowed time.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t help but snort at his response as she rotated on her heel, her back to him. When he didn\u2019t immediately return to her, she twisted her head. \u201cYou didn\u2019t have to put me in a sling to get me naked, Cap,\u201d she cooed. \u201cAll you had to do was ask nicely.\u201d</p><p>His cheeks turned crimson red as he set his uniform back down on the counter. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean it in that way. I\u2019m the reason you\u2019re in that sling to begin with. The least I can do is try to help you.\u201d</p><p>Moving closer, he hovered over her, fingers tugging upwards on the hem of her t-shirt and helping her get it off over the right side of her body. The left side, with the sling, was a bit more of a challenge. He had to stretch the arm hole a little bit more to help get her arm out.When she was finally out, her fingers undid the button of her jeans and pushed them past her hips. With a little shimmy, they pooled at her feet. Kicking off her shoes was the only primary task left, and at least she was able to do that with ease.</p><p>With her shoes off, she was left in nothing but her lacy wine-colored bra and matching cheeky panties in front of the Captain. Her face heated, and she instantly tried to hide it. She was embarrassed by her response. If she were with anyone else, she\u2019d have more confidence. But because it was Steve, she felt like a lovesick teenager again.</p><p>His lips interrupted her thoughts, pressing against the area between her shoulder blades, his fingers tickling against the flesh of her back as they hooked under her bra band. He made quick work of the delicate fabric, kissing each of her shoulders as soon as the straps fell to the wayside. He decided to let her shimmy herself out of her panties before he pressed his lips to her ear. \u201cGo get in the tub. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p><p>He slid out the bathroom door and was gentlemanly enough not to peek at her full frontal display.</p><p>Toni let out a small sigh before turning to step in the tub. When her foot hit the water, she hissed. The water was boiling. Did that big oaf even have the best internal thermometer?</p><p>She glanced up and saw his shadow moving closer, so she sunk into the water quickly while still keeping her left arm and the sling out of it. Because of how quick she slithered in, she didn\u2019t have much time to get adjusted to the heat, causing her features to twist in discomfort. Before Steve rounded the corner, she crossed her right arm right in front of her chest and tilted her legs away from where the soldier would be, attempting to cover the more intimate parts of her.</p><p>He rounded the corner and sank to his knees beside the bathtub, studying her. \u201cToo hot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToni.\u201d</p><p>She fidgeted in the water a bit. \u201cNow that I\u2019m used to it, not so much. It was scorching when I first climbed in, though.\u201d</p><p>He snorted. \u201cWould you have preferred an ice bath? I can tell you from personal experience that too much heat is better.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t help but chuckle. \u201cLook who\u2019s making jokes now. Nah. Save the ice for after the bath. Makes temperature play more fun,\u201d she purred, wiggling her eyebrows.</p><p>There was a sigh of minimal aggravation in his throat as he rose to grab the shower head before taking his place on his knees once again. The only response Toni knew how to give was a smart one.</p><p>\u201cOooh,\u201d she cooed, leaning her head against the back of the tub and winking at the super soldier, \u201cA little bath play to get me warmed up? Why, Captain, you certainly are being brazen tonight.\u201d</p><p>His face was as burgundy as the hand towel he had used, now strewn across the vanity counter. \u201cJesus, Toni. You just don\u2019t know when to quit,\u201d he breathed. His fingers tugged at her caramel strands before cupping her face. \u201cI\u2019m going to need you to help me here. Lean forward so I can wash your hair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to do this, Steve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but I want to. Lean forward,\u201d he ordered again, patting her right shoulder to coax her into an upright position. His fingers then reached across her to the comfort strap of the sling, lift it and pulling it over her head before sliding the contraption off altogether. \u201cDon\u2019t want to get this wet.\u201d</p><p>Toni\u2019s first instinct was to stretch the arm, but she winced as pain shot up into her shoulder. She rested her elbow on the left side of the tub as she leaned forward like Steve instructed.</p><p>The captain\u2019s lips formed a straight line. \u201cSeriously? Just pretend it\u2019s still in the sling while I do this. Don\u2019t make it any worse, doll.\u201d</p><p>That sentiment made her heart leap a little bit, but she grumbled something under her breath as he turned on the shower head, a gentle stream of water pouring out. His hand brushed against her forehead, tilting her head back. She sucked in a breath, prepared for the same scalding temperature as her bath water was. Rather surprised when the water cascading down her scalp was more on the warm side, she couldn\u2019t help but melt into it.</p><p>A minuscule smile danced across Steve\u2019s lips as his free hand slid under Toni\u2019s hair, supporting it to make sure he got every strand wet. When he was satisfied with the tips, he moved his attention to her roots, gingerly pushing her head to the left and then the right to ensure he covered every millimeter with water. He even lifted her soaked hair to get the underside and the back of her neck.</p><p>When he was satisfied that her hair was damp enough, he turned off the shower head and set it to the side, stretching across the tub to reach an orange bottle. A dollop of the creamy white product poured into a button on his hand before he returned the bottle to its original position. Rubbing his palms together, he lathered up his hands before immediately going to work on her scalp, fingertips massaging the soap into her hair.</p><p>The sensation was delightful to Toni. It had been a long while since she actually went to the salon, and Steve was proving to be quite the expert. She let out a sharp exhale through her nose, then whined when Steve\u2019s fingers stopped.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, doll?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothin\u2019. Just feels good.\u201d</p><p>There was a rumble in his chest, a soft laugh as he continued to work the soap through her roots, down her strands. Finished with his work, his fingers curled around the shower head again.</p><p>She let out a tiny groan as he went back and washed out the shampoo. He didn\u2019t need to push her head to either side. She rolled it around, hoping that she was making his job a little bit easier.</p><p>When he turned off the shower head again, he pressed his lips to her forehead. \u201cFeel better?\u201d</p><p>She murmured an affirmative before a smirk tugged at her lips. \u201cA bit, but you forgot the conditioner.\u201d Yeah, she could\u2019ve gotten by without it, but that would mean the pampering would stop.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t have that now, can we?\u201d His fingers curled around her sopping mane and twisted ever so lightly, letting the excess water drain before he reached over for another bottle on the edge of the tub. He repeated the same process as he had with the shampoo, but this time, he paid more attention to the dangling strands rather than her scalp. Task completed, he pushed himself to his feet and rummaged in one of the nearby cupboards.</p><p>She craned her neck slightly. \u201cWhat\u2019re you looking for?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t respond as he continued to rummage. It was a minute before he stood upright again and turned to the tub, dropping a beige washcloth in the water while holding on to a large navy blue towel. \u201cYou need to let that sit a minute, right? Why don\u2019t you go ahead and wash off a little bit more and I\u2019ll come back in a few to finish up?\u201d</p><p>Toni was about to argue before Steve set the towel down and retreated into her bedroom.</p><p>She huffed, her fingers curling around the washcloth and wringing it out as best as she could before draping it over the side of the tub. Swinging her right arm across her torso more freely, she grabbed a bottle of lavender soap and squeezed out a drop before placing the bottle in its empty spot. Folding the cloth over delicately, she rubbed her fingers together against the fabric to try to create a lather. When she was sure the lather was sufficient enough, she rubbed the cloth against her face, scrubbing her cheeks, T-zone and the back of her neck. She continued down her body, being very ginger with her left arm. Rising just a bit so that her chest and abdomen were barely out of the water, she washed those bits too. Her legs proved to be a bit more challenging, but she made do. With her body now lathered up, she rinsed out the washcloth to get the soap out of it before she retraced her bath, scrubbing just a little harder to ensure every sud was off her body.</p><p>Just as she finished up with her legs, Steve appeared in the doorway, a large folded silver fuzzy blanket in his arms. \u201cAll taken care of, Toni?\u201d</p><p>She smirked playfully. \u201cIn a way, I suppose you could say that.\u201d</p><p>He scoffed and dropped to his knees again, reaching for the shower head one more. The water dribbled over her scalp and down her strands as his fingers tugged as tenderly as they could, trying to get out all of the conditioner. After a few minutes under the stream, he stopped and returned the shower head to its original position then ducked down to pull the plug on the drain. Rotating on his heel, he turned to give Toni just the smallest amount of privacy as he unfurled the enormous blue towel, getting it ready for her to step into.</p><p>She waited until most of the water was drained before she considered standing. Since her left arm was already braced against the tub, she didn\u2019t see any harm in putting a little bit of weight on it to stabilize herself. She overestimated her capabilities, and her elbow slid into the tub, hitting the porcelain bottom with a thud and sending a stabbing pain shooting up her arm. \u201cSonova mother-\u201d</p><p>What happened next was rather a blur. Steve rapidly rotated on his heel and tossed the towel over Toni\u2019s body before lifting her out of the tub bridal style. He tilted his body slightly, sliding her out of his arms and onto her feet before snatching the towel away to dry off her neck and left arm. The sling was back across her body in the next instant, and he handed the towel back to her. \u201cToni, you have got to be more careful.\u201d</p><p>She blushed furiously, keeping the towel as fanned out as she could while drying off. \u201cJesus, Steve. I\u2019m Iron Woman, not a porcelain doll. It was just an accident.\u201d</p><p>He rotated to her backside, which she realized was on full display, causing her to blush harder. The towel slipped through her fingers as he tugged it away, drying off what she would allow him to. \u201cI just worry about you. After everything that\u2019s happened, I am allowed to do that, y\u2019know.\u201d</p><p>She was about to sass him about that remark not being fair when he dropped the towel and leaned over to grab the huge fuzzy blanket. She could feel him fanning it out behind her. The fabric then hugged against her body, encasing her in its (and Steve\u2019s) warmth. She clutched at the front of the blanket to make sure it stayed closed. A hum trilled from her throat as she leaned back against the super soldier.</p><p>\u201cC\u2019mon,\u201d he said, tapping her back to make her step forward. \u201cLet\u2019s get you to bed.\u201d</p><p>This time she didn\u2019t fight him. Bed actually sounded relaxing and she could probably use the sleep. She sauntered into the bedroom and crawled onto the bed. \u201cThanks for looking out for me, Steve,\u201d she mumbled as she snuggled in the blanket further, closing her eyes. </p><p>There was a soft guffaw on the other side of the bed followed by a dip, causing her eyes to pop open. The super soldier swung his legs up and tilted his torso back so he was resting himself on the pillow beside her. \u201cYou can\u2019t get rid of me that easily, Stark.\u201d</p><p>His left arm extended, inviting her in for snuggles. She found herself wiggling in closer, tucking herself tight against his side. Thinking about the situation, she snorted.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s funny?\u201d</p><p>She grinned against the fabric of his t-shirt. \u201cGuess now I can say I got Captain America into my bed, huh?\u201d</p><p>He groaned, right hand covering his eyes. \u201cOh for the love of God, Toni-\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2018I may have got Cap in bed, but he\u2019s the one who got me naked.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cStark-\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2018He used the pretense of my injured arm to get me naked. Isn\u2019t he such a romantic?\u2019\u201d</p><p>In an instant, his lips were on hers in an effort to shut her up. His teeth tugged gently at her lower lip in warning before he pulled away. \u201cYou just don\u2019t know when to quit, do you, Toni?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she drawled out, shimmying up a little bit and draping her bent arm over his chest with a wink. \u201cI\u2019ll tell ya one thing though, Cap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s sure as hell one way to get me started.\u201d</p></p>",

Every mission she went on, no matter how she tried to baby it, she always ended up somehow screwing with her left arm even more.</p><p>Steve Rogers sat across from her aboard the quinjet as they made their way back to the Avengers compound from an Infinity Stone recovery mission. His baby blue eyes watched her intensively. &ldquo;Doin&rsquo; okay, Stark?&rdquo;</p><p>She rotated her shoulder cuff, popping a couple joints and wincing. &ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; she grunted out, &ldquo;Just an old battle wound flaring up.&rdquo; And it was. During one of her initial jaunts as Iron Woman, she took a anti-aircraft shell to her left side. She never really checked herself out, thinking the suit took a brunt of the hit. Add years of missions on top of that, and yeah, she was probably a little worse for wear. </p><p>&ldquo;When we get back to the compound,&rdquo; he started, nodding towards her arm, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re getting checked out.&rdquo;</p><p>Her milk chocolate eyes rolled dramatically. &ldquo;I lived for years with the arc reactor in my chest, Cap. I think I can handle a little arthritis.&rdquo;</p><p>He scoffed. &ldquo;I saw those hits you took. That&rsquo;s more than just a little arthritis, Stark.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I can handle my own-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You just don&rsquo;t know when to quit, do you, Toni?&rdquo; he snarled, effectively silencing her before he leaned back in his seat. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re getting checked out, and that&rsquo;s an order.&rdquo;</p><p>That last sentence came out as a low growl, causing the Iron Woman&rsquo;s eyebrow to quirk up. He was certainly adamant on her being seen. He never used that tone with her, his &ldquo;don&rsquo;t mess with me; I&rsquo;m Captain America&rdquo; tone. His barking, however, just made her want to test the waters and not get checked out even more.</p><p>The moment they landed, however, she wasn&rsquo;t given much of a choice. Steve grabbed her right arm and all but dragged her into the infirmary. She figured he was going to leave, satisfied that he got her in there, but no. The super soldier of course stayed, because he knew Toni too well and knew she&rsquo;d take off.</p><p>They both emerged from the infirmary two hours after entering, Toni&rsquo;s left arm in a sling and the Iron Woman suit left in the middle of the room. Steve walked her back to her suite door like the gentleman he was, but she couldn&rsquo;t help but glare at the captain, raising her bent ligament to make a point. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m incapacitated now. Are you satisfied, Captain?&rdquo;</p><p>She fumbled around in her right pocket for her keys, but they were nowhere to be found, which meant they were in her left side. She went to stretch out her chicken wing when she huffed in aggravation.</p><p>Steve reached into her left pocket where one key was sticking out, clutching them as soon as they slipped into his massive palm. His other hand nudged Toni out of the way as he slid one of the keys into the lock. The tumbler system clicked, so he jiggled the handle and the door opened. He gestured the woman inside, following in close pursuit without saying a word.</p><p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t have to do that. I could&rsquo;ve gotten my own damn door, especially if I wasn&rsquo;t in a freakin&rsquo; sling! Rogers,&rdquo; she hissed, pouting at the super soldier who was pacing through her suite, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m literally going to struggle to do everything. I&rsquo;m not even going to be able to wash the filth and sweat out of my hair.&rdquo;</p><p>The blond disappeared down a small hallway and into her bedroom. When he didn&rsquo;t immediately return, Toni padded down the corridor after him. The sound of water rushing from her faucet piqued her curiosity. &ldquo;Now you&rsquo;re just invading my privacy. What the hell are you even doing?&rdquo;</p><p>He rounded the corner from the bathroom, and Toni couldn&rsquo;t help but gawk at the sight in front of her. He had peeled the top layer of his navy blue suit away, revealing a white v-neck t-shirt while still leaving his pants and boots in place. His shooting gloves had been discarded, replaced with a burgundy hand towel as he wrung his hands dry. A small smirk played at the corner of his lips.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the genius,&rdquo; he quipped, cocking his head to the side. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s it sound like?&rdquo;</p><p>Her face flushed slightly, casting her eyes down away from Steve. &ldquo;If I weren&rsquo;t in this sling, you wouldn&rsquo;t have to do this either.&rdquo;</p><p>His hair trembled as his shook his head, disappearing again behind the bathroom door. The handles of the bathtub squeaked, meaning the tub must have been filled to the right height for the captain.</p><p>Her feet propelled her forward into the spacious bathroom as Steve pushed himself to his feet. She kind of stood there gazing at him, expecting him to get the hint and give her a little privacy. Instead, he closed the gap between them, his calloused fingers tugging at the hem of her t-shirt. Her body went rigid, and his baby blue hues glanced at her.</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo;</p><p>She cleared her throat, eyes locked on the hands still on her shirt hem. Not that she didn&rsquo;t want him to continue. She just didn&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;d be so bold with something like that. &ldquo;Uhhh&hellip;whatcha doin&rsquo; there, Cap?&rdquo;</p><p>He cocked his head to the side. &ldquo;Well, considering you keep complaining about that damn sling, I&rsquo;m pretty sure I&rsquo;m helping you get a bath.&rdquo; He dropped his hands away and grabbed his shooting gloves and suit jacket from the counter. &ldquo;I can go get Nat if you want, but I know she&rsquo;s getting herself looked at too and is training at the moment. You&rsquo;re free to wait until she&rsquo;s finished&hellip;when the water is icy cold.&rdquo;</p><p>Toni raised her eyebrow quizzically. &ldquo;Since when did sweet, chivalrous Capsicle become so brazen?&rdquo;</p><p>A wider smile tugged at his lips this time, making his beard move ever so slightly. &ldquo;Since I got a second chance with a certain billionaire on possibly borrowed time.&rdquo;</p><p>She couldn&rsquo;t help but snort at his response as she rotated on her heel, her back to him. When he didn&rsquo;t immediately return to her, she twisted her head. &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t have to put me in a sling to get me naked, Cap,&rdquo; she cooed. &ldquo;All you had to do was ask nicely.&rdquo;</p><p>His cheeks turned crimson red as he set his uniform back down on the counter. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean it in that way. I&rsquo;m the reason you&rsquo;re in that sling to begin with. The least I can do is try to help you.&rdquo;</p><p>Moving closer, he hovered over her, fingers tugging upwards on the hem of her t-shirt and helping her get it off over the right side of her body. The left side, with the sling, was a bit more of a challenge. He had to stretch the arm hole a little bit more to help get her arm out.When she was finally out, her fingers undid the button of her jeans and pushed them past her hips. With a little shimmy, they pooled at her feet. Kicking off her shoes was the only primary task left, and at least she was able to do that with ease.</p><p>With her shoes off, she was left in nothing but her lacy wine-colored bra and matching cheeky panties in front of the Captain. Her face heated, and she instantly tried to hide it. She was embarrassed by her response. If she were with anyone else, she&rsquo;d have more confidence. But because it was Steve, she felt like a lovesick teenager again.</p><p>His lips interrupted her thoughts, pressing against the area between her shoulder blades, his fingers tickling against the flesh of her back as they hooked under her bra band. He made quick work of the delicate fabric, kissing each of her shoulders as soon as the straps fell to the wayside. He decided to let her shimmy herself out of her panties before he pressed his lips to her ear. &ldquo;Go get in the tub. I&rsquo;ll be right back.&rdquo;</p><p>He slid out the bathroom door and was gentlemanly enough not to peek at her full frontal display.</p><p>Toni let out a small sigh before turning to step in the tub. When her foot hit the water, she hissed. The water was boiling. Did that big oaf even have the best internal thermometer?</p><p>She glanced up and saw his shadow moving closer, so she sunk into the water quickly while still keeping her left arm and the sling out of it. Because of how quick she slithered in, she didn&rsquo;t have much time to get adjusted to the heat, causing her features to twist in discomfort. Before Steve rounded the corner, she crossed her right arm right in front of her chest and tilted her legs away from where the soldier would be, attempting to cover the more intimate parts of her.</p><p>He rounded the corner and sank to his knees beside the bathtub, studying her. &ldquo;Too hot?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, you are.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Toni.&rdquo;</p><p>She fidgeted in the water a bit. &ldquo;Now that I&rsquo;m used to it, not so much. It was scorching when I first climbed in, though.&rdquo;</p><p>He snorted. &ldquo;Would you have preferred an ice bath? I can tell you from personal experience that too much heat is better.&rdquo;</p><p>She couldn&rsquo;t help but chuckle. &ldquo;Look who&rsquo;s making jokes now. Nah. Save the ice for after the bath. Makes temperature play more fun,&rdquo; she purred, wiggling her eyebrows.</p><p>There was a sigh of minimal aggravation in his throat as he rose to grab the shower head before taking his place on his knees once again. The only response Toni knew how to give was a smart one.</p><p>&ldquo;Oooh,&rdquo; she cooed, leaning her head against the back of the tub and winking at the super soldier, &ldquo;A little bath play to get me warmed up? Why, Captain, you certainly are being brazen tonight.&rdquo;</p><p>His face was as burgundy as the hand towel he had used, now strewn across the vanity counter. &ldquo;Jesus, Toni. You just don&rsquo;t know when to quit,&rdquo; he breathed. His fingers tugged at her caramel strands before cupping her face. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to need you to help me here. Lean forward so I can wash your hair.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to do this, Steve.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, but I want to. Lean forward,&rdquo; he ordered again, patting her right shoulder to coax her into an upright position. His fingers then reached across her to the comfort strap of the sling, lift it and pulling it over her head before sliding the contraption off altogether. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t want to get this wet.&rdquo;</p><p>Toni&rsquo;s first instinct was to stretch the arm, but she winced as pain shot up into her shoulder. She rested her elbow on the left side of the tub as she leaned forward like Steve instructed.</p><p>The captain&rsquo;s lips formed a straight line. &ldquo;Seriously? Just pretend it&rsquo;s still in the sling while I do this. Don&rsquo;t make it any worse, doll.&rdquo;</p><p>That sentiment made her heart leap a little bit, but she grumbled something under her breath as he turned on the shower head, a gentle stream of water pouring out. His hand brushed against her forehead, tilting her head back. She sucked in a breath, prepared for the same scalding temperature as her bath water was. Rather surprised when the water cascading down her scalp was more on the warm side, she couldn&rsquo;t help but melt into it.</p><p>A minuscule smile danced across Steve&rsquo;s lips as his free hand slid under Toni&rsquo;s hair, supporting it to make sure he got every strand wet. When he was satisfied with the tips, he moved his attention to her roots, gingerly pushing her head to the left and then the right to ensure he covered every millimeter with water. He even lifted her soaked hair to get the underside and the back of her neck.</p><p>When he was satisfied that her hair was damp enough, he turned off the shower head and set it to the side, stretching across the tub to reach an orange bottle. A dollop of the creamy white product poured into a button on his hand before he returned the bottle to its original position. Rubbing his palms together, he lathered up his hands before immediately going to work on her scalp, fingertips massaging the soap into her hair.</p><p>The sensation was delightful to Toni. It had been a long while since she actually went to the salon, and Steve was proving to be quite the expert. She let out a sharp exhale through her nose, then whined when Steve&rsquo;s fingers stopped.</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong, doll?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nothin&rsquo;. Just feels good.&rdquo;</p><p>There was a rumble in his chest, a soft laugh as he continued to work the soap through her roots, down her strands. Finished with his work, his fingers curled around the shower head again.</p><p>She let out a tiny groan as he went back and washed out the shampoo. He didn&rsquo;t need to push her head to either side. She rolled it around, hoping that she was making his job a little bit easier.</p><p>When he turned off the shower head again, he pressed his lips to her forehead. &ldquo;Feel better?&rdquo;</p><p>She murmured an affirmative before a smirk tugged at her lips. &ldquo;A bit, but you forgot the conditioner.&rdquo; Yeah, she could&rsquo;ve gotten by without it, but that would mean the pampering would stop.</p><p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t have that now, can we?&rdquo; His fingers curled around her sopping mane and twisted ever so lightly, letting the excess water drain before he reached over for another bottle on the edge of the tub. He repeated the same process as he had with the shampoo, but this time, he paid more attention to the dangling strands rather than her scalp. Task completed, he pushed himself to his feet and rummaged in one of the nearby cupboards.</p><p>She craned her neck slightly. &ldquo;What&rsquo;re you looking for?&rdquo;</p><p>He didn&rsquo;t respond as he continued to rummage. It was a minute before he stood upright again and turned to the tub, dropping a beige washcloth in the water while holding on to a large navy blue towel. &ldquo;You need to let that sit a minute, right? Why don&rsquo;t you go ahead and wash off a little bit more and I&rsquo;ll come back in a few to finish up?&rdquo;</p><p>Toni was about to argue before Steve set the towel down and retreated into her bedroom.</p><p>She huffed, her fingers curling around the washcloth and wringing it out as best as she could before draping it over the side of the tub. Swinging her right arm across her torso more freely, she grabbed a bottle of lavender soap and squeezed out a drop before placing the bottle in its empty spot. Folding the cloth over delicately, she rubbed her fingers together against the fabric to try to create a lather. When she was sure the lather was sufficient enough, she rubbed the cloth against her face, scrubbing her cheeks, T-zone and the back of her neck. She continued down her body, being very ginger with her left arm. Rising just a bit so that her chest and abdomen were barely out of the water, she washed those bits too. Her legs proved to be a bit more challenging, but she made do. With her body now lathered up, she rinsed out the washcloth to get the soap out of it before she retraced her bath, scrubbing just a little harder to ensure every sud was off her body.</p><p>Just as she finished up with her legs, Steve appeared in the doorway, a large folded silver fuzzy blanket in his arms. &ldquo;All taken care of, Toni?&rdquo;</p><p>She smirked playfully. &ldquo;In a way, I suppose you could say that.&rdquo;</p><p>He scoffed and dropped to his knees again, reaching for the shower head one more. The water dribbled over her scalp and down her strands as his fingers tugged as tenderly as they could, trying to get out all of the conditioner. After a few minutes under the stream, he stopped and returned the shower head to its original position then ducked down to pull the plug on the drain. Rotating on his heel, he turned to give Toni just the smallest amount of privacy as he unfurled the enormous blue towel, getting it ready for her to step into.</p><p>She waited until most of the water was drained before she considered standing. Since her left arm was already braced against the tub, she didn&rsquo;t see any harm in putting a little bit of weight on it to stabilize herself. She overestimated her capabilities, and her elbow slid into the tub, hitting the porcelain bottom with a thud and sending a stabbing pain shooting up her arm. &ldquo;Sonova mother-&rdquo;</p><p>What happened next was rather a blur. Steve rapidly rotated on his heel and tossed the towel over Toni&rsquo;s body before lifting her out of the tub bridal style. He tilted his body slightly, sliding her out of his arms and onto her feet before snatching the towel away to dry off her neck and left arm. The sling was back across her body in the next instant, and he handed the towel back to her. &ldquo;Toni, you have got to be more careful.&rdquo;</p><p>She blushed furiously, keeping the towel as fanned out as she could while drying off. &ldquo;Jesus, Steve. I&rsquo;m Iron Woman, not a porcelain doll. It was just an accident.&rdquo;</p><p>He rotated to her backside, which she realized was on full display, causing her to blush harder. The towel slipped through her fingers as he tugged it away, drying off what she would allow him to. &ldquo;I just worry about you. After everything that&rsquo;s happened, I am allowed to do that, y&rsquo;know.&rdquo;</p><p>She was about to sass him about that remark not being fair when he dropped the towel and leaned over to grab the huge fuzzy blanket. She could feel him fanning it out behind her. The fabric then hugged against her body, encasing her in its (and Steve&rsquo;s) warmth. She clutched at the front of the blanket to make sure it stayed closed. A hum trilled from her throat as she leaned back against the super soldier.</p><p>&ldquo;C&rsquo;mon,&rdquo; he said, tapping her back to make her step forward. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get you to bed.&rdquo;</p><p>This time she didn&rsquo;t fight him. Bed actually sounded relaxing and she could probably use the sleep. She sauntered into the bedroom and crawled onto the bed. &ldquo;Thanks for looking out for me, Steve,&rdquo; she mumbled as she snuggled in the blanket further, closing her eyes. </p><p>There was a soft guffaw on the other side of the bed followed by a dip, causing her eyes to pop open. The super soldier swung his legs up and tilted his torso back so he was resting himself on the pillow beside her. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t get rid of me that easily, Stark.&rdquo;</p><p>His left arm extended, inviting her in for snuggles. She found herself wiggling in closer, tucking herself tight against his side. Thinking about the situation, she snorted.</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s funny?&rdquo;</p><p>She grinned against the fabric of his t-shirt. &ldquo;Guess now I can say I got Captain America into my bed, huh?&rdquo;</p><p>He groaned, right hand covering his eyes. &ldquo;Oh for the love of God, Toni-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I may have got Cap in bed, but he&rsquo;s the one who got me naked.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Stark-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;He used the pretense of my injured arm to get me naked.
