You never knew who was going to through a chair at you, who was going to set the classroom on fire or try and snort one of the chemicals you had them using. This, however, was totally out of range in terms of predicted events. </p><p>Last night, you and your old college friends decided to go out and celebrate your friend&rsquo;s birthday. Your plan was to go out, have one or two drinks, and get home at a reasonable time as you still had classes to teach before the parent-teacher conference the next day. \u00a0</p><p>However, the drinks didn\u2019t seem to stop, each bar seeming dark and busier than the last, moods changing from light and funny to dark and sultry. Somehow, you\u2019d gotten into one of the more exclusive clubs in New York, and the night took a bit of turn. You\u2019d lost everyone you arrived with, dancing your way through the crowd looking for someone, anyone you knew. \u00a0</p><p>You found someone, just not someone you knew. Yet. </p><p>Stumbling into your apartment, your new friend attached to your neck. You struggled to make it to your bed using only touch, the lips on yours and hands all over your skin distracting you to no end. \u00a0</p><p>The night was a blur, many highs and loud moans before the stranger disappearing home, you barely acknowledging his excuse before passing out for what was left of the night. \u00a0</p><p>The next morning you evaluated the damage before deciding a collared shirt would have to do in order to cover the hickey\u2019s scattered across your collar bones. Rushing into work, you hoped no one would notice the hangover ruining your mood or your nearly late arrival. \u00a0</p><p>Thankfully none of your students noticed anything, although they never could tell when you were hungover. A few of your close friends at work had glimpsed the decorations given to you whilst you were making coffee, adding a few sarcastic comments to your breaks. \u00a0</p><p>By the time the parent-teacher conference began, you were desperately chugging water and counting down to your next allowance of painkillers, the hangover threatening to send you home. \u00a0 </p><p>You loved teaching; you loved all the kids. The one thing you hated more than anything though, was the parents. They all thought their child was the best, even when they were total idiotic brats. \u00a0</p><p>With each parent you spoke to, your mood became harder and harder to cover up, and things were about to go from bad to worse. </p><p>\u201cHi I\u2019m Miss Y/L/N, I\u2019m Peters -\u201d You froze as you recognised the man in front of you. </p><p>\u201cWell this is awkward.\u201d </p><p>\u201cUmm, you\u2019re Peter\u2019s dad?\u201d </p><p>\u201cPretty much.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah this is awkward.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just gonna clear the air so we can move on. Hey, we hooked up last night and it turns out you are my child&rsquo;s teacher. That\u2019s super awkward but I think we should do the professional thing now and then go get a drink afterwards.\u201d </p><p>\u201cPeters great, except that he doesn\u2019t always turn up. I have more parents but I finish at nine.\u201d You blurted out, getting to the point as quickly as possible </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be here. Maybe we can talk about helping Peter more then. I\u2019m Tony by the way\u201d Your mystery man winked before heading back to Peter who had planted himself in the far corner of the room. \u00a0</p><p>The rest of the night was a blur, the parents seemingly more tolerable than before, although you put that down to excitement. </p><p>Just as he promised, Tony was waiting, having dropped Peter back home. </p><p>You spent several hours, walking, talking \u2013 about both yourselves and Peter \u2013 and getting to know the other. For a night out fling, the connection you felt was more than you could understand. \u00a0</p><p>Every night for the rest of the week, Tony took you somewhere different, wooing you a little more each time. You had never felt a connection like this before. By the time Friday came around you couldn\u2019t help but melt into him and agree when he invited you back with him </p><p>Waking up on Saturday morning, Tony grabbed your hand on the way to the kitchen. Although as he turned the corner you heard a faint \u201cUh oh.\u201d </p><p>\u201cMISS Y/L/N?!\u201d \u00a0</p><p>\u201cMR STARK?!\u201d \u00a0</p><p>\u201cPeter, now please calm down.\u201d </p><p>\u201cSHE\u2019S MY TEACHER\u201d </p><p>It was going to be a long school term. \u00a0</p><hr><p>This is so short im so sorry pls dont hate me.</p>",

There really were more pressing matters at hand.</p><p>The timing of that scene helped to show how broken, tired, and delirious Tony had become after having all that time on the ship to stew over his thoughts (2 people can only stand so much of each other for consecutive days at a time). If Tony had been in his right mind, he wouldn\u2019t have blown up like that. And the team knew that, as well.</p><p>All of their reactions and expressions reflected empathy and sorrow. They all knew how he felt, except they were glad to see him when the opposite party was not. The mood-maker of the team had run out of fuel. He\u2019d lost all hope and put himself at fault for their circumstances. His outward blame of the others was an attempt of trying to convince himself that all this wasn\u2019t just because of him.\u00a0\u201cIf I had just made the damn shield around the world, this all would have never happened.\u201d That was Tony\u2019s mindset in that low point.</p><p>But with rest and time, he realized there was really nothing any of them could have done to truly prevent Thanos from coming. There was no way to predict how he would have come. So with what little hope was left in his shattered heart, Tony strengthened his resolve and settled down to raise a family. And he cherished it with all his heart.</p><p>After Infinity War, Tony\u2019s fear of the unknown had become far more exemplified. If it hadn\u2019t been for the understanding of his teammates, during that outburst, I don\u2019t think Endgame would have ever happened. Tony would have flat out refused to associate with them. But no one rose to the bait. There wasn\u2019t a shouting match between him and anyone else - just Tony venting, for all intents and purposes. There was still love there; they were still a family. They argued, they made up, they comforted.
