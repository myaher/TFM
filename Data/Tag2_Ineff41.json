The waiters knew him, the receptionist knew him and the chef sent his compliments with the desert.</p><p>Crowley finally saw a new side of Aziraphale. Not that Crowley knew a lot of sides of Aziraphale. Well if you don&rsquo;t count his backside at which Crowley would not so gracefully glance when Aziraphale was walking ahead of him.</p><p>Crowley stared at the menu and went blank. He had no idea what to order but thankfully Aziraphale read his mind and ordered sushi for the both of them.</p><p>The waiter poured out their wine and Crowley looked around the restaurant, which was quite full with people having their lunch. He turned back towards Aziraphale when something bumped into his chair and ran past him and towards Aziraphale</p><p>A small boy, maybe 4 or 5 years old had slipped away from his table and was now fascinated by Aziraphale&rsquo;s tartan bowtie. His expression was filled with joy and curiosity which made Crowley smile.</p><p>Aziraphale&rsquo;s expression on the other hand was the exact opposite. His eyes had gone wide with confusion and he definitely had no idea how to deal with a human child. Crowley grinned and got up from his seat. He plucked the boy from the floor and placed him on the edge of the table so that he was, to Aziraphale&rsquo;s dismay, even closer to his bowtie.</p><p>Crowley stared with a wide smile as he saw the boy grab the bowtie and Aziraphale freeze at what might the child do next. He had a warm feeling inside him which he couldn&rsquo;t quite explain but didn&rsquo;t want to get rid of.</p><p>&ldquo;Y'know, he won&rsquo;t bite you&rdquo; Crowley said pulling his chair closer to Aziraphale&rsquo;s. Aziraphale pursed his lips as the child let go of his bowtie and in a sudden move made a wild grab for Crowley&rsquo;s sunglasses. Crowley flinched and backed up as the boy&rsquo;s hand hit his face knocking his sunglasses down to the floor.</p><p>Crowley opened his eyes and looked at the pair in front of him. This was the first time Aziraphale had seen Crowley without the sunglasses and he thought of it to be the most beautiful sight he had ever seen. Crowley&rsquo;s eyes weren&rsquo;t the regular blue, green or brown but a shining yellow colour which seemed to pierce Aziraphale&rsquo;s heart. He sat there staring at Crowley with his beautiful eyes and a small smile and felt as if he was sinking deeper into an ocean.</p><p>They couldn&rsquo;t say the same about the young boy though. He was either afraid of Crowley&rsquo;s eyes or of the consequences he thought he might suffer for knocking down his glasses and swatting him in the face. His joyful expression instantly changed to discomfort and Crowley took that chance to put him back on the floor. The boy scurried back to his parents and Crowley picked up his sunglasses from near Aziraphale&rsquo;s feet. &ldquo;<i>Tartan socks. I should&rsquo;ve known.&rdquo;</i>\u00a0he thought to himself and smiled.</p><p>He hurriedly put on his glasses and quickly looked around. No one had noticed them. &ldquo;<i>Great,&quot;\u00a0</i>Crowley thought\u00a0<i>&quot;think I spooked this one too.&rdquo;</i></p><p>Aziraphale was still staring at him and Crowley shrank in his seat.

The waiters knew him, the receptionist knew him and the chef sent his compliments with the desert.</p><p>Crowley finally saw a new side of Aziraphale. Not that Crowley knew a lot of sides of Aziraphale. Well if you don\u2019t count his backside at which Crowley would not so gracefully glance when Aziraphale was walking ahead of him.</p><p>Crowley stared at the menu and went blank. He had no idea what to order but thankfully Aziraphale read his mind and ordered sushi for the both of them.</p><p>The waiter poured out their wine and Crowley looked around the restaurant, which was quite full with people having their lunch. He turned back towards Aziraphale when something bumped into his chair and ran past him and towards Aziraphale</p><p>A small boy, maybe 4 or 5 years old had slipped away from his table and was now fascinated by Aziraphale\u2019s tartan bowtie. His expression was filled with joy and curiosity which made Crowley smile.</p><p>Aziraphale\u2019s expression on the other hand was the exact opposite. His eyes had gone wide with confusion and he definitely had no idea how to deal with a human child. Crowley grinned and got up from his seat. He plucked the boy from the floor and placed him on the edge of the table so that he was, to Aziraphale\u2019s dismay, even closer to his bowtie.</p><p>Crowley stared with a wide smile as he saw the boy grab the bowtie and Aziraphale freeze at what might the child do next. He had a warm feeling inside him which he couldn\u2019t quite explain but didn\u2019t want to get rid of.</p><p>\u201cY'know, he won\u2019t bite you\u201d Crowley said pulling his chair closer to Aziraphale\u2019s. Aziraphale pursed his lips as the child let go of his bowtie and in a sudden move made a wild grab for Crowley\u2019s sunglasses. Crowley flinched and backed up as the boy\u2019s hand hit his face knocking his sunglasses down to the floor.</p><p>Crowley opened his eyes and looked at the pair in front of him. This was the first time Aziraphale had seen Crowley without the sunglasses and he thought of it to be the most beautiful sight he had ever seen. Crowley\u2019s eyes weren\u2019t the regular blue, green or brown but a shining yellow colour which seemed to pierce Aziraphale\u2019s heart. He sat there staring at Crowley with his beautiful eyes and a small smile and felt as if he was sinking deeper into an ocean.</p><p>They couldn\u2019t say the same about the young boy though. He was either afraid of Crowley\u2019s eyes or of the consequences he thought he might suffer for knocking down his glasses and swatting him in the face. His joyful expression instantly changed to discomfort and Crowley took that chance to put him back on the floor. The boy scurried back to his parents and Crowley picked up his sunglasses from near Aziraphale\u2019s feet. \u201c<i>Tartan socks. I should\u2019ve known.\u201d</i>\u00a0he thought to himself and smiled.</p><p>He hurriedly put on his glasses and quickly looked around. No one had noticed them. \u201c<i>Great,\"\u00a0</i>Crowley thought\u00a0<i>\"think I spooked this one too.\u201d</i></p><p>Aziraphale was still staring at him and Crowley shrank in his seat.

I was in the middle of telling you how much I love Shakespeare\"&nbsp; Aziraphale smiled as he grabbed the opportunity to change the subject and make Crowley feel more at ease.</p><p>Crowley relaxed in his chair and grinned as Aziraphale rambled about Othello and Hamlet and all of Shakespeare&rsquo;s plays. Crowley paid attention to every word this time. Well not every word, he sometimes got lost in Aziraphale&rsquo;s sweet voice and miss out on a few sentences, but he tried his best to pay his full attention.</p><p>Aziraphale on the other hand was happily analysing all of Shakespeare&rsquo;s works and somewhere in the midst of his rambles he realised that he might be boring Crowley to death. However, one glance at his companion told him that Crowley was one of, if not the only person who liked listening to what Aziraphale had to say.</p><p>And that&rsquo;s how the pair spent their day. One listening to the other passionately talk about something they liked. One silently sipping wine and nodding at parts where they agreed with the other. And both of them having a great long&nbsp;<strike>debate</strike>&nbsp;discussion about a matter they both were passionate about.&nbsp;</p></p>",
