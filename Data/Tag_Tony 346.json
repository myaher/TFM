I\u2019d like to prompt you with someone being rude/mean to Tony and Diana losing her SHIT. </b></p>\n\n<p><b>P.S. You\u2019re super lovely and I always enjoy seeing your posts!</b></p><p><b><i>Here you go, it took me a while to figure out how to start this but once I started I fell in love.

Diana was there to\ndo a cover on the Smithsonian. They asked her to come in and do a preview of\nthe article <i>and</i> to ask if they could\ninclude her in the piece. Even though she had already politely declined. </p><p>\u201cPlease Miss Prince, you\u2019d make a lovely addition to the\narticle.\u201d Mr. Roberts attempted to plead with her one more time. He was a nice\ngentleman in his forties, his hair graying at the edges. But his eyes gleamed\nwith a vision for her behind his round wire framed glances.</p><p>Diana held back a sigh, \u201cThank you Mr. Roberts, I\u2019m truly flattered.\nBut again, I must decline.\u201d She could tell he wanted to push the issue further\nbut just barely held his tongue. He would be fine. Once the next pretty face\nwalked past him he\u2019d forget all about her.</p><p>\u201cSuch a shame, if you ever decide to change careers, please,\u201d\nhe grabbed a business card from his desk and held it out to her, \u201ccall me.\u201d</p><p>Reluctantly she took the card, \u201cI\u2019ll keep that in mind.\u201d\nSmiling politely she rose from her seat and made her exit out the editor\u2019s\noffice. </p><p>She knew the only reason they asked her out here was because\nthey wanted to convince her to model for them. But Diana wasn\u2019t the model type,\nshe preferred her seclusion. Staying tucked away in museum away from the eyes\nof the public. It\u2019s where she belonged.</p><p>Diana made to leave the magazine\u2019s office building when a\nsmall commotion caught her attention. She stopped and wondered down an adjacent\nhall. At the end of the hall there\u2019s an open room, the doors wide open and a\ngroup of girls swarming a man. A beautiful man.</p><!-- more --><p>He was on the smaller side, standing probably an inch or two\nsmaller than him. Brown fluffy hair and mess since one of the girls kept\nrunning her fingers through it. His skin has a natural tan color that made his\nbrown eyes shine and sparkle. Although it was hard to see because another girl\nkept brushing blush or concealer over his cheek bone. Blocking Diana\u2019s view or\ncausing the man to shut his eyes against the assault.</p><p>When the makeup artist finally moved aside Diana was able to\nsee the rest of the man. His face held an interesting mustache and beard\ncombination. Framing his full pink lips perfectly in (if she remembered\ncorrectly) a van dyke style.</p><p>He wore a black long sleeve shirt that was one size to big.\nHanging loose around his collarbones and covering the palms of his hands. He\nwas sitting on a wooden stool but she could see his pants were baggy and black\nas well. On his feet he had plain white sneakers. Over all, he was adorable.</p><p>\u201cMr. Stark, look here for me.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widen, she could see it now. That was Tony Stark. </p><p>Mr. Stark turned on the stool looking at the photographer.\nLegs slightly spread with one bent and the other stretched down to the floor.\nHis hands held onto the edge of the stool between his legs. The photographer\npractically cooed at him, praising him and directing him to make subtle moves\nand faces as the camera flashed. A few times Stark laughed at the photographers\nantics, making his face light up in a beautiful smile. Diana was memorized.</p><p>Then their eyes locked. Tony looked up and past the\nphotographer, right at Diana. He froze momentarily, looking at her as she stood\nthere. She watched him take her in, from her hair which she wore loose. Long,\nbrown, and wavy hair framed her face and stretched past her shoulders. Eyes\nfollowed the length of her green dress that stopped right below her knees and\nthen finished at her white heels.</p><p>When his eyes bounced back up to her face and saw her\nsmiling at him, he blushed and looked away. The photographer went crazy and the\ngirls squealed on the sidelines. Diana couldn\u2019t help basking in the feeling of\nmaking one of the world\u2019s sexiest bachelors (as multiple magazines claimed)\nblush.</p><p>\u201cDisgusting.\u201d The quiet sneer beside her shocked the feeling\nright out of her.</p><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d</p><p>A little louder this time, the blonde lady beside him\ngestured at Stark, \u201cIt\u2019s disgusting, the way Stark plays women left and right.\u201d\nShe was glaring at Mr. Stark and Diana turned back to him just in time to see\nhurt flash across his face. The photographer was taking a break from snapping\npictures, briefly glancing through the ones he\u2019d already taken and Stark had\nstood from his seat. Coming closer to where Diana stood with the blonde lady which\nis why he probably heard what they woman said. \u201cTrust me girl, you don\u2019t want\nto go near someone like that. He\u2019s just like the rest of these trash fuck boys.\u201d</p><p>Diana was astounding by this woman. The nerve of people\nthese days, it filled her with anger on Stark\u2019s behalf. \u201cWho are you to say\nsuch things?\u201d</p><p>Now it was the lady\u2019s turn to be surprised, \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas Mr. Stark personally wronged you?</p><p>\u201cNo, but he has a reputation\u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d Diana was furious, this woman was just walking around\nslandering a man she knew nothing about. \u201cJust because one person says\nsomething doesn\u2019t make it true. If you personally don\u2019t know Mr. Stark who are\nyou to decide who he is and walk around slandering his name and personality. If\nanything I\u2019d say you were disgusting for walking around talking about someone\nlike that. It\u2019s rude. Consider using your time more wisely in the future and\nfix your own personality.\u201d</p><p>Leaving the woman shocked speechless she turned and walked\naway. Nothing bothered her more than how people were so quick to judge and\nexecute negative opinions on one another. <i>Why\ndid everyone hold so much hate in their hearts?</i> That thought briefly made\nher think of Ares but she shock off the thoughts of him.</p><p>She was almost at the exit when she heard someone call for\nher. </p><p>\u201cWait! Miss\u2013\u201d She stopped and turned to see Stark trying to\ncatch up to her. </p><p>\u201cMr. Stark?\u201d He stopped in front of her and she vaguely\nrealized the in her heels she was much taller than him.</p><p>\u201cThank you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI \u2013 I saw was you did back there. Defending me against that\nlady\u2026you didn\u2019t have to do that. So thanks.\u201d Stark was awkwardly avoiding her\neyes, preferring instead to stare at his feet. His hands were clasped in front\nof his self, fingers fiddling with his sleeves nervously. That woman was wrong\nto judge him and realistically Stark didn\u2019t have to chase her down and thank\nher, but he did.</p><p>Stepping forward to close the space between them Diana\nbrought her hands up. Gently she cradled his head, holding him in place as she\nleaned forward to place a kiss on his forehead. \u201cYou are very welcome Mr.\nStark.\u201d When she leaned back she could see the blush had returned. It looked\neven better up close. Faintly she heard him say something but couldn\u2019t quite\nmake out what it was, \u201cHmm?\u201d</p><p>He looked up at her, hands still cupped around his ears, \u201cT-Tony.\nPlease, call me Tony.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome, Tony.\u201d</p><p>His smile was bright and beautiful. \u201cCan I take you to\ndinner?\u201d</p><p>Normally she would decline, keeping herself as unattached as\npossible. But something about him was addicting and she couldn\u2019t find it\nanywhere in her soul to say no, \u201cI\u2019d love dinner.\u201d She pulled out her phone and\nlet him enter his number. \u201cI look forward to speaking with you later Tony.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI \u2013 uh, same.\u201d Smiling she turned to leave but his hand\nshot out and grabbed hers, \u201cWait! I don\u2019t\u2026I don\u2019t know your name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDiana. Diana Prince.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDiana\u2026I like it. Bye Diana.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoodbye Tony.\u201d</p><hr><p>Walking up to the restaurant she could see Tony standing\noutside wait for her but he was facing the other direction so all she could see\nwas his back. They had agreed to meet up at a small family own Italian place\nthat wasn\u2019t too far from Diana\u2019s house. </p><p>She checked her watch, she was a few minutes early. It made\nher wonder how long Tony had been waiting for her. He was wearing black jeans\nthat fit him perfectly, a complete change from when she\u2019d first seen him. And\nfrom what she could tell, his shirt was a maroon button up with matching\nsneakers.</p><p>She\u2019s glad her outfit wasn\u2019t overdone. Her white blouse,\ndark blue jeans and brown heel boots were comfortable and causal enough for\ntheir date. Today she wore her hair up in a ponytail since it was too hot to\nlet it rest on her neck. \u201cHi Tony.\u201d Hearing her voice he spun around and she\nwas surprised to see him holding a white rose. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got it for you. I just \u2013 wanted to get you something. It\nmeant a lot to me for you to come out with me tonight and I wanted to get you\nsomething. I think it compliments your natural beauty.\u201d He held out the rose,\ngaze looking right past her and blush faint on his face.</p><p>\u201cThank you Tony, it\u2019s lovely.\u201d She took the flower, bringing\nit close to hide her smile behind and smell. Tony finally looked eyes with her\nand beamed at her. She reached for his hand, \u201cCome on, I\u2019m getting hungry.\u201d</p><p>Dinner was just as good. The food was tasteful and well\nmade. They decided to forego any alcohol, Tony expressing he\u2019d hope they could\nstroll through the park afterwards and so they stuck to water. Conversation was\neasy, picking up and dropping topics as they ate. When the bill came Tony paid.\nDiana attempted to pay her portion but he insisted that he would pay since he\nhad asked for the date. If she wanted to pay she would have to ask him out.</p><p>Afterwards, they left the restaurant hand in hand. Diana\u2019s\nrose held in her free hand. Arriving at the park they walked the path, asking\neach other questions to get to know one another. When they got to an opening\nwith a \u00a0pond and benches Tony lead her\nover to an empty spot.</p><p>\u201cWait here.\u201d Making sure Diana was sitting on the bench and\nnot going to go anywhere Tony jogged away out of sight.</p><p>Diana was pleasantly surprised. She\u2019d never really been on a\ndate before but she was enjoying her time with Tony. He was cute, going from\nsmooth and charming to fumbling and nervous in a heartbeat. He was sweet,\nasking her about her interest and then pitching in what he knew of the topic.\nWhen it came up how many languages she knew he tested her. Bouncing between\nlanguages and when she spoke in a few he didn\u2019t recognize he was amazed. Asking\nher where they came from and asking her to teach him a few words. Then when she\nmentioned the Smithsonian he mentioned a few pieces of art he held a love for.</p><p>It was refreshing, learning about Tony Stark and learning\nthat he was nothing like the world thought of him. It made her think about how\nwrong that woman had been in her assumptions.</p><p>Twirling the rose she thought about asking Tony on a date\nwhen she saw the man returning. \u201cWhere\u2019d you go?\u201d</p><p>He stood in front of her, panting a little bit but smiling happily.\n\u201cThey have duck food dispensers and I\u2019ve always wanted to do this.\u201d He took her\nfree hand, dropping little pebbled food in her hand. \u201cHold these, I\u2019m going to\nsee if I can lure some over here.\u201d He went over to the pond where a few ducks\nand swans were swimming and laying about. \u201cHere duckies!\u201d Dropping so pebbles\nhe slowly backed up until he had a few trialing after him.</p><p>Once he was by the bench again he sat down next to her and\ntogether they fed the ducks. It was peaceful, \u201cYou know\u2026\u201d Diana turned to look\nat Tony who\u2019s gaze stayed on the ducks, \u201cmy aunt used to call me Ducky when I was\nlittle.\u201d</p><p>Diana couldn\u2019t help it this time, she squealed in delight.</p><p>After that day, Tony\u2019s name was permanently changed to Ducky\nin her phone.</p><hr><p><br/></p><p><b>Support me with <a href=\"https://ko-fi.com/D1D6FO7A\">Ko-fi</a></b></p>",

It looked\neven better up close.

It made\nher wonder how long Tony had been waiting for her. He was wearing black jeans\nthat fit him perfectly, a complete change from when she\u2019d first seen him. And\nfrom what she could tell, his shirt was a maroon button up with matching\nsneakers.</p><p>She\u2019s glad her outfit wasn\u2019t overdone.

I just \u2013 wanted to get you something. It\nmeant a lot to me for you to come out with me tonight and I wanted to get you\nsomething.

Tony finally looked eyes with her\nand beamed at her. She reached for his hand, \u201cCome on, I\u2019m getting hungry.\u201d</p><p>Dinner was just as good. The food was tasteful and well\nmade. They decided to forego any alcohol, Tony expressing he\u2019d hope they could\nstroll through the park afterwards and so they stuck to water.

She\u2019d never really been on a\ndate before but she was enjoying her time with Tony. He was cute, going from\nsmooth and charming to fumbling and nervous in a heartbeat. He was sweet,\nasking her about her interest and then pitching in what he knew of the topic.\nWhen it came up how many languages she knew he tested her.

Diana was there to\ndo a cover on the Smithsonian. They asked her to come in and do a preview of\nthe article <i>and</i> to ask if they could\ninclude her in the piece. Even though she had already politely declined. </p><p>\u201cPlease Miss Prince, you\u2019d make a lovely addition to the\narticle.\u201d Mr. Roberts attempted to plead with her one more time. He was a nice\ngentleman in his forties, his hair graying at the edges. But his eyes gleamed\nwith a vision for her behind his round wire framed glances.</p><p>Diana held back a sigh, \u201cThank you Mr. Roberts, I\u2019m truly flattered.\nBut again, I must decline.\u201d She could tell he wanted to push the issue further\nbut just barely held his tongue. He would be fine. Once the next pretty face\nwalked past him he\u2019d forget all about her.</p><p>\u201cSuch a shame, if you ever decide to change careers, please,\u201d\nhe grabbed a business card from his desk and held it out to her, \u201ccall me.\u201d</p><p>Reluctantly she took the card, \u201cI\u2019ll keep that in mind.\u201d\nSmiling politely she rose from her seat and made her exit out the editor\u2019s\noffice. </p><p>She knew the only reason they asked her out here was because\nthey wanted to convince her to model for them. But Diana wasn\u2019t the model type,\nshe preferred her seclusion. Staying tucked away in museum away from the eyes\nof the public. It\u2019s where she belonged.</p><p>Diana made to leave the magazine\u2019s office building when a\nsmall commotion caught her attention. She stopped and wondered down an adjacent\nhall. At the end of the hall there\u2019s an open room, the doors wide open and a\ngroup of girls swarming a man. A beautiful man.</p>[[MORE]]<p>He was on the smaller side, standing probably an inch or two\nsmaller than him. Brown fluffy hair and mess since one of the girls kept\nrunning her fingers through it. His skin has a natural tan color that made his\nbrown eyes shine and sparkle. Although it was hard to see because another girl\nkept brushing blush or concealer over his cheek bone. Blocking Diana\u2019s view or\ncausing the man to shut his eyes against the assault.</p><p>When the makeup artist finally moved aside Diana was able to\nsee the rest of the man. His face held an interesting mustache and beard\ncombination. Framing his full pink lips perfectly in (if she remembered\ncorrectly) a van dyke style.</p><p>He wore a black long sleeve shirt that was one size to big.\nHanging loose around his collarbones and covering the palms of his hands. He\nwas sitting on a wooden stool but she could see his pants were baggy and black\nas well. On his feet he had plain white sneakers. Over all, he was adorable.</p><p>\u201cMr. Stark, look here for me.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widen, she could see it now. That was Tony Stark. </p><p>Mr. Stark turned on the stool looking at the photographer.\nLegs slightly spread with one bent and the other stretched down to the floor.\nHis hands held onto the edge of the stool between his legs. The photographer\npractically cooed at him, praising him and directing him to make subtle moves\nand faces as the camera flashed. A few times Stark laughed at the photographers\nantics, making his face light up in a beautiful smile. Diana was memorized.</p><p>Then their eyes locked. Tony looked up and past the\nphotographer, right at Diana. He froze momentarily, looking at her as she stood\nthere. She watched him take her in, from her hair which she wore loose. Long,\nbrown, and wavy hair framed her face and stretched past her shoulders. Eyes\nfollowed the length of her green dress that stopped right below her knees and\nthen finished at her white heels.</p><p>When his eyes bounced back up to her face and saw her\nsmiling at him, he blushed and looked away. The photographer went crazy and the\ngirls squealed on the sidelines. Diana couldn\u2019t help basking in the feeling of\nmaking one of the world\u2019s sexiest bachelors (as multiple magazines claimed)\nblush.</p><p>\u201cDisgusting.\u201d The quiet sneer beside her shocked the feeling\nright out of her.</p><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d</p><p>A little louder this time, the blonde lady beside him\ngestured at Stark, \u201cIt\u2019s disgusting, the way Stark plays women left and right.\u201d\nShe was glaring at Mr. Stark and Diana turned back to him just in time to see\nhurt flash across his face. The photographer was taking a break from snapping\npictures, briefly glancing through the ones he\u2019d already taken and Stark had\nstood from his seat. Coming closer to where Diana stood with the blonde lady which\nis why he probably heard what they woman said. \u201cTrust me girl, you don\u2019t want\nto go near someone like that. He\u2019s just like the rest of these trash fuck boys.\u201d</p><p>Diana was astounding by this woman. The nerve of people\nthese days, it filled her with anger on Stark\u2019s behalf. \u201cWho are you to say\nsuch things?\u201d</p><p>Now it was the lady\u2019s turn to be surprised, \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas Mr. Stark personally wronged you?</p><p>\u201cNo, but he has a reputation\u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d Diana was furious, this woman was just walking around\nslandering a man she knew nothing about. \u201cJust because one person says\nsomething doesn\u2019t make it true. If you personally don\u2019t know Mr. Stark who are\nyou to decide who he is and walk around slandering his name and personality. If\nanything I\u2019d say you were disgusting for walking around talking about someone\nlike that. It\u2019s rude. Consider using your time more wisely in the future and\nfix your own personality.\u201d</p><p>Leaving the woman shocked speechless she turned and walked\naway. Nothing bothered her more than how people were so quick to judge and\nexecute negative opinions on one another. <i>Why\ndid everyone hold so much hate in their hearts?</i> That thought briefly made\nher think of Ares but she shock off the thoughts of him.</p><p>She was almost at the exit when she heard someone call for\nher. </p><p>\u201cWait! Miss\u2013\u201d She stopped and turned to see Stark trying to\ncatch up to her. </p><p>\u201cMr. Stark?\u201d He stopped in front of her and she vaguely\nrealized the in her heels she was much taller than him.</p><p>\u201cThank you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI \u2013 I saw was you did back there. Defending me against that\nlady\u2026you didn\u2019t have to do that. So thanks.\u201d Stark was awkwardly avoiding her\neyes, preferring instead to stare at his feet. His hands were clasped in front\nof his self, fingers fiddling with his sleeves nervously. That woman was wrong\nto judge him and realistically Stark didn\u2019t have to chase her down and thank\nher, but he did.</p><p>Stepping forward to close the space between them Diana\nbrought her hands up. Gently she cradled his head, holding him in place as she\nleaned forward to place a kiss on his forehead. \u201cYou are very welcome Mr.\nStark.\u201d When she leaned back she could see the blush had returned.

His face held an interesting mustache and beard\ncombination. Framing his full pink lips perfectly in (if she remembered\ncorrectly) a van dyke style.</p><p>He wore a black long sleeve shirt that was one size to big.\nHanging loose around his collarbones and covering the palms of his hands. He\nwas sitting on a wooden stool but she could see his pants were baggy and black\nas well. On his feet he had plain white sneakers. Over all, he was adorable.</p><p>&ldquo;Mr. Stark, look here for me.&rdquo;</p><p>Her eyes widen, she could see it now. That was Tony Stark. </p><p>Mr. Stark turned on the stool looking at the photographer.\nLegs slightly spread with one bent and the other stretched down to the floor.\nHis hands held onto the edge of the stool between his legs. The photographer\npractically cooed at him, praising him and directing him to make subtle moves\nand faces as the camera flashed. A few times Stark laughed at the photographers\nantics, making his face light up in a beautiful smile. Diana was memorized.</p><p>Then their eyes locked. Tony looked up and past the\nphotographer, right at Diana. He froze momentarily, looking at her as she stood\nthere. She watched him take her in, from her hair which she wore loose. Long,\nbrown, and wavy hair framed her face and stretched past her shoulders. Eyes\nfollowed the length of her green dress that stopped right below her knees and\nthen finished at her white heels.</p><p>When his eyes bounced back up to her face and saw her\nsmiling at him, he blushed and looked away. The photographer went crazy and the\ngirls squealed on the sidelines. Diana couldn&rsquo;t help basking in the feeling of\nmaking one of the world&rsquo;s sexiest bachelors (as multiple magazines claimed)\nblush.</p><p>&ldquo;Disgusting.&rdquo; The quiet sneer beside her shocked the feeling\nright out of her.</p><p>&ldquo;Pardon?&rdquo;</p><p>A little louder this time, the blonde lady beside him\ngestured at Stark, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s disgusting, the way Stark plays women left and right.&rdquo;\nShe was glaring at Mr. Stark and Diana turned back to him just in time to see\nhurt flash across his face. The photographer was taking a break from snapping\npictures, briefly glancing through the ones he&rsquo;d already taken and Stark had\nstood from his seat. Coming closer to where Diana stood with the blonde lady which\nis why he probably heard what they woman said. &ldquo;Trust me girl, you don&rsquo;t want\nto go near someone like that. He&rsquo;s just like the rest of these trash fuck boys.&rdquo;</p><p>Diana was astounding by this woman. The nerve of people\nthese days, it filled her with anger on Stark&rsquo;s behalf. &ldquo;Who are you to say\nsuch things?&rdquo;</p><p>Now it was the lady&rsquo;s turn to be surprised, &ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Has Mr. Stark personally wronged you?</p><p>&ldquo;No, but he has a reputation&ndash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And?&rdquo; Diana was furious, this woman was just walking around\nslandering a man she knew nothing about. &ldquo;Just because one person says\nsomething doesn&rsquo;t make it true. If you personally don&rsquo;t know Mr. Stark who are\nyou to decide who he is and walk around slandering his name and personality. If\nanything I&rsquo;d say you were disgusting for walking around talking about someone\nlike that. It&rsquo;s rude. Consider using your time more wisely in the future and\nfix your own personality.&rdquo;</p><p>Leaving the woman shocked speechless she turned and walked\naway. Nothing bothered her more than how people were so quick to judge and\nexecute negative opinions on one another. <i>Why\ndid everyone hold so much hate in their hearts?</i> That thought briefly made\nher think of Ares but she shock off the thoughts of him.</p><p>She was almost at the exit when she heard someone call for\nher. </p><p>&ldquo;Wait! Miss&ndash;&rdquo; She stopped and turned to see Stark trying to\ncatch up to her. </p><p>&ldquo;Mr. Stark?&rdquo; He stopped in front of her and she vaguely\nrealized the in her heels she was much taller than him.</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What for?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I &ndash; I saw was you did back there. Defending me against that\nlady&hellip;you didn&rsquo;t have to do that. So thanks.&rdquo; Stark was awkwardly avoiding her\neyes, preferring instead to stare at his feet. His hands were clasped in front\nof his self, fingers fiddling with his sleeves nervously. That woman was wrong\nto judge him and realistically Stark didn&rsquo;t have to chase her down and thank\nher, but he did.</p><p>Stepping forward to close the space between them Diana\nbrought her hands up. Gently she cradled his head, holding him in place as she\nleaned forward to place a kiss on his forehead. &ldquo;You are very welcome Mr.\nStark.&rdquo; When she leaned back she could see the blush had returned. It looked\neven better up close. Faintly she heard him say something but couldn&rsquo;t quite\nmake out what it was, &ldquo;Hmm?&rdquo;</p><p>He looked up at her, hands still cupped around his ears, &ldquo;T-Tony.\nPlease, call me Tony.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re welcome, Tony.&rdquo;</p><p>His smile was bright and beautiful. &ldquo;Can I take you to\ndinner?&rdquo;</p><p>Normally she would decline, keeping herself as unattached as\npossible. But something about him was addicting and she couldn&rsquo;t find it\nanywhere in her soul to say no, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d love dinner.&rdquo; She pulled out her phone and\nlet him enter his number. &ldquo;I look forward to speaking with you later Tony.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I &ndash; uh, same.&rdquo; Smiling she turned to leave but his hand\nshot out and grabbed hers, &ldquo;Wait! I don&rsquo;t&hellip;I don&rsquo;t know your name.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Diana. Diana Prince.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Diana&hellip;I like it. Bye Diana.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Goodbye Tony.&rdquo;</p><hr /><p>Walking up to the restaurant she could see Tony standing\noutside wait for her but he was facing the other direction so all she could see\nwas his back. They had agreed to meet up at a small family own Italian place\nthat wasn&rsquo;t too far from Diana&rsquo;s house. </p><p>She checked her watch, she was a few minutes early. It made\nher wonder how long Tony had been waiting for her. He was wearing black jeans\nthat fit him perfectly, a complete change from when she&rsquo;d first seen him. And\nfrom what she could tell, his shirt was a maroon button up with matching\nsneakers.</p><p>She&rsquo;s glad her outfit wasn&rsquo;t overdone. Her white blouse,\ndark blue jeans and brown heel boots were comfortable and causal enough for\ntheir date. Today she wore her hair up in a ponytail since it was too hot to\nlet it rest on her neck. &ldquo;Hi Tony.&rdquo; Hearing her voice he spun around and she\nwas surprised to see him holding a white rose. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I got it for you. I just &ndash; wanted to get you something. It\nmeant a lot to me for you to come out with me tonight and I wanted to get you\nsomething. I think it compliments your natural beauty.&rdquo; He held out the rose,\ngaze looking right past her and blush faint on his face.</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you Tony, it&rsquo;s lovely.&rdquo; She took the flower, bringing\nit close to hide her smile behind and smell. Tony finally looked eyes with her\nand beamed at her. She reached for his hand, &ldquo;Come on, I&rsquo;m getting hungry.&rdquo;</p><p>Dinner was just as good. The food was tasteful and well\nmade. They decided to forego any alcohol, Tony expressing he&rsquo;d hope they could\nstroll through the park afterwards and so they stuck to water. Conversation was\neasy, picking up and dropping topics as they ate. When the bill came Tony paid.\nDiana attempted to pay her portion but he insisted that he would pay since he\nhad asked for the date. If she wanted to pay she would have to ask him out.</p><p>Afterwards, they left the restaurant hand in hand. Diana&rsquo;s\nrose held in her free hand. Arriving at the park they walked the path, asking\neach other questions to get to know one another. When they got to an opening\nwith a &nbsp;pond and benches Tony lead her\nover to an empty spot.</p><p>&ldquo;Wait here.&rdquo; Making sure Diana was sitting on the bench and\nnot going to go anywhere Tony jogged away out of sight.</p><p>Diana was pleasantly surprised. She&rsquo;d never really been on a\ndate before but she was enjoying her time with Tony. He was cute, going from\nsmooth and charming to fumbling and nervous in a heartbeat. He was sweet,\nasking her about her interest and then pitching in what he knew of the topic.\nWhen it came up how many languages she knew he tested her. Bouncing between\nlanguages and when she spoke in a few he didn&rsquo;t recognize he was amazed. Asking\nher where they came from and asking her to teach him a few words. Then when she\nmentioned the Smithsonian he mentioned a few pieces of art he held a love for.</p><p>It was refreshing, learning about Tony Stark and learning\nthat he was nothing like the world thought of him. It made her think about how\nwrong that woman had been in her assumptions.</p><p>Twirling the rose she thought about asking Tony on a date\nwhen she saw the man returning. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;d you go?&rdquo;</p><p>He stood in front of her, panting a little bit but smiling happily.\n&ldquo;They have duck food dispensers and I&rsquo;ve always wanted to do this.&rdquo; He took her\nfree hand, dropping little pebbled food in her hand. &ldquo;Hold these, I&rsquo;m going to\nsee if I can lure some over here.&rdquo; He went over to the pond where a few ducks\nand swans were swimming and laying about. &ldquo;Here duckies!&rdquo; Dropping so pebbles\nhe slowly backed up until he had a few trialing after him.</p><p>Once he was by the bench again he sat down next to her and\ntogether they fed the ducks. It was peaceful, &ldquo;You know&hellip;&rdquo; Diana turned to look\nat Tony who&rsquo;s gaze stayed on the ducks, &ldquo;my aunt used to call me Ducky when I was\nlittle.&rdquo;</p><p>Diana couldn&rsquo;t help it this time, she squealed in delight.</p><p>After that day, Tony&rsquo;s name was permanently changed to Ducky\nin her phone.</p><hr /><p><br /></p><p><b>Support me with <a href=\"https://ko-fi.com/D1D6FO7A\">Ko-fi</a></b></p>",

Diana was there to\ndo a cover on the Smithsonian. They asked her to come in and do a preview of\nthe article <i>and</i> to ask if they could\ninclude her in the piece. Even though she had already politely declined. </p>\n<p>&ldquo;Please Miss Prince, you&rsquo;d make a lovely addition to the\narticle.&rdquo; Mr. Roberts attempted to plead with her one more time.

He would be fine. Once the next pretty face\nwalked past him he&rsquo;d forget all about her.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Such a shame, if you ever decide to change careers, please,&rdquo;\nhe grabbed a business card from his desk and held it out to her, &ldquo;call me.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Reluctantly she took the card, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll keep that in mind.&rdquo;\nSmiling politely she rose from her seat and made her exit out the editor&rsquo;s\noffice. </p>\n<p>She knew the only reason they asked her out here was because\nthey wanted to convince her to model for them. But Diana wasn&rsquo;t the model type,\nshe preferred her seclusion. Staying tucked away in museum away from the eyes\nof the public. It&rsquo;s where she belonged.</p>\n<p>Diana made to leave the magazine&rsquo;s office building when a\nsmall commotion caught her attention. She stopped and wondered down an adjacent\nhall. At the end of the hall there&rsquo;s an open room, the doors wide open and a\ngroup of girls swarming a man. A beautiful man.</p>\n</p>",
