I was fired from Marvel \u2014 from two Star Wars projects.\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"https://twitter.com/ChuckWendig/status/1050822080130895878\">The detail from the tweets I tweeted</a>:</p><p>So, here\u2019s a thing that has happened \u2013 I just got fired from Marvel.\u00a0 Taken off issues 4 and 5 of SHADOW OF VADER, and taken off an as-yet-unannounced SW book.\u00a0 This might be a long thread, so apologies in advance.\u00a0 (I hesitate to talk about this, because honestly, it gives the Worst Possible People a win, something they\u2019ve wanted for a while.\u00a0 But I also feel like I\u2019ve long held to honesty and forthrightness, and I don\u2019t feel like lying when people realize I\u2019m not on these books anymore.)</p><p>To rewind a little bit, when SW: AFTERMATH came out, I assume most know but maybe you don\u2019t, I put some ahh, elements in there (LGBT characters) that were not received well by a certain subset of fandom.\u00a0 That resulted in both a negative review campaign, found across various FB groups and other Worst Places on the Internet, that began mounting the very minute the book dropped online.\u00a0 I was literally at a midnight release of the book, and when I got done, there were already a pile of one-star reviews piling up \u2013 which seemed strange, obviously.\u00a0 And scary, too.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t understand what was happening at the time.\u00a0 (And as a caveat, obviously I recognize that yes, some people just don\u2019t like the book for the Usual Reasons, and people who hold those reasons are not to be lumped in with the more septic side of fandom. Tl;dr see also <i>TLJ </i>reviews.)</p><p>I also started receiving TONS of harassment \u2013 harassment that has gone on for years, harassment that has required me to contact local police and warn them of SWATting attempts, harassment across all corners of the Internet, here, FB, Reddit, YouTube.\u00a0 Some of it was bot stuff, obviously, or sock puppets, but some of it was pretty creepy, and very personal.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t call a lot of it out or even highlight, but it was there, a sort of\u2026 constant background noise.\u00a0 (Christ, for an extra special treat go search for my name and check out the YouTube videos if you want an eye-opening glimpse.)</p><p>And I was worried of course because, jeez, I thought I had screwed up.\u00a0 I wondered for a time if the book was bad.\u00a0 But then it hit list and stayed on list for four weeks \u2013 and the next two books hit list, too, and EMPIRE\u2019S END landed even higher on the list than the first book.\u00a0 And privately, I was told by folks inside LFL that there was no worry here, that they valued that I spoke out both speaking up for myself and for STAR WARS, which has always honestly been a progressive brand and company.\u00a0 And it made me very proud to work for them, too, not just because \u2014 holy hell, basking in the glow of STAR WARS, but because the people were great, and they totally got it.\u00a0 (Hell, a lot of the people inside LFL have experience considerable harassment.\u00a0 I mean, that\u2019s not news, but Kelly Marie-Tran?\u00a0 Bueller?\u00a0 Bueller?)</p><p>After I did HYPERION with Marvel, they hired me then to write the TFA adaptation, which meant I got to work with some wonderful folks \u2013 @hantos and @cracksh0t \u2013 on a project that was tricky, because it ended up being more a translation of the movie than an adaptation.\u00a0 (I know Heather received some of the worst harassment in the entire industry \u2013 I can\u2019t speak to how well Marvel did or did not protect her from it, but I know she was at the bottom of a major misery funnel from Comicsgate and their ilk.\u00a0 Far worse than I suffered.)</p><p>Still, I thought things were good, and I hoped to do more work with Marvel or SW or a combo of the two someday \u2013 comics isn\u2019t really my \u201cthing,\u201d per se, but I felt like I was getting a handle on it.\u00a0 Of course, the harassment continued \u2013 and it got worse again when <i>TLJ </i>came out.\u00a0 Which I\u2019m sure is no surprise to anyone who has ever tweeted, \u201cHey, I really liked THE LAST JEDI!\u201d\u00a0 That\u2019s really when I started to see lots of YouTube videos and stuff about me and it was\u2026 Well, it was creepy.\u00a0 And I\u2019d seen other signs of people being\u2026 fired for political reasons, or folks like @ChelseaCain who was yanked around and was also the subject of considerable nastiness.</p><p>And then we announced SHADOW OF VADER juuuuust last weekend, and people were excited, and I thought everything was good.\u00a0 I was not made aware of any issues, and my online self has always been my online self, so.\u00a0 Except, yeah, no.\u00a0 Today I got the call.\u00a0 I\u2019m fired.\u00a0 Because of the negativity and vulgarity that my tweets bring.\u00a0 Seriously, that\u2019s what Mark, the editor said.\u00a0 It was too much politics, too much vulgarity, too much negativity on my part.</p><p>Basically, because I was not civil.</p><p>Which, of course, is their decision to make.\u00a0 I\u2019m not their boss.\u00a0 (And, turns out, they\u2019re not the boss of me, either.\u00a0 Har har.)\u00a0 (I joke because otherwise, I cry.)</p><p>My understanding over this call was that this was a Marvel decision, not an LFL decision, but I can\u2019t really confirm that.\u00a0 The editor said he had made the call.\u00a0 He seemed genuinely upset at my tweets and profanity, so maybe that\u2019s accurate.\u00a0 And again, that\u2019s his right to do so.\u00a0 If they honestly feel that my presence will damage the book, I don\u2019t want that.\u00a0 I want the book to shine, and artists like Juanan Ramirez and Greg Smallwood to do their amazing thing.\u00a0 Artists like that are gods in my mind, so I\u2019m happy to not distract from their literal magic.</p><p>But it does set a troubling precedent.\u00a0 One we\u2019ve seen already \u2013 James Gunn, Jessica White, and so on \u2013 of folks fired because they riled up the wasp\u2019s nest of asterisk-gate.\u00a0 And it seems odd to be mad that I\u2019m mad about politics when \u2013 well, look around.\u00a0 Climate change, kids in cages, sexual harassers at the topmost tiers of power, and so on.\u00a0 A call for civility as the PA GOP candidate threatens Tom Wolf with a golf cleat stomping.\u00a0 I dunno, man.</p><p>I know it hands Comicsgate a big win.\u00a0 It will embolden them.\u00a0 But they won \u2014 I\u2019m out of Marvel and, I guess for now, at least, out of any kind of Star Wars.\u00a0 Do your victory lap, I guess.\u00a0 (Just please leave me out of it.)\u00a0 (All that being said, a lot of wonderful people still work inside those institutions and storyworlds, and I hope you\u2019ll continue to support them and the stories they\u2019re telling.)\u00a0 To conclude: this is really quite chilling.\u00a0 And it breaks my heart.\u00a0 I am very sad, and worried for the country I live in, and the world, and for creative people all around.\u00a0 Courage to you all.\u00a0 I have a dire fear this is going to get a whole lot worse before it gets better.</p><p>P.S. Vote in November like your life depends on it.\u00a0 Because it just might.</p></blockquote><p>&mdash;</p>",

I was fired from Marvel \u2014 from two Star Wars projects.\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"https://twitter.com/ChuckWendig/status/1050822080130895878\">The detail from the tweets I tweeted</a>:</p><p>So, here\u2019s a thing that has happened \u2013 I just got fired from Marvel.\u00a0 Taken off issues 4 and 5 of SHADOW OF VADER, and taken off an as-yet-unannounced SW book.\u00a0 This might be a long thread, so apologies in advance.\u00a0 (I hesitate to talk about this, because honestly, it gives the Worst Possible People a win, something they\u2019ve wanted for a while.\u00a0 But I also feel like I\u2019ve long held to honesty and forthrightness, and I don\u2019t feel like lying when people realize I\u2019m not on these books anymore.)</p><p>To rewind a little bit, when SW: AFTERMATH came out, I assume most know but maybe you don\u2019t, I put some ahh, elements in there (LGBT characters) that were not received well by a certain subset of fandom.\u00a0 That resulted in both a negative review campaign, found across various FB groups and other Worst Places on the Internet, that began mounting the very minute the book dropped online.\u00a0 I was literally at a midnight release of the book, and when I got done, there were already a pile of one-star reviews piling up \u2013 which seemed strange, obviously.\u00a0 And scary, too.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t understand what was happening at the time.\u00a0 (And as a caveat, obviously I recognize that yes, some people just don\u2019t like the book for the Usual Reasons, and people who hold those reasons are not to be lumped in with the more septic side of fandom. Tl;dr see also <i>TLJ </i>reviews.)</p><p>I also started receiving TONS of harassment \u2013 harassment that has gone on for years, harassment that has required me to contact local police and warn them of SWATting attempts, harassment across all corners of the Internet, here, FB, Reddit, YouTube.\u00a0 Some of it was bot stuff, obviously, or sock puppets, but some of it was pretty creepy, and very personal.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t call a lot of it out or even highlight, but it was there, a sort of\u2026 constant background noise.\u00a0 (Christ, for an extra special treat go search for my name and check out the YouTube videos if you want an eye-opening glimpse.)</p><p>And I was worried of course because, jeez, I thought I had screwed up.\u00a0 I wondered for a time if the book was bad.\u00a0 But then it hit list and stayed on list for four weeks \u2013 and the next two books hit list, too, and EMPIRE\u2019S END landed even higher on the list than the first book.\u00a0 And privately, I was told by folks inside LFL that there was no worry here, that they valued that I spoke out both speaking up for myself and for STAR WARS, which has always honestly been a progressive brand and company.\u00a0 And it made me very proud to work for them, too, not just because \u2014 holy hell, basking in the glow of STAR WARS, but because the people were great, and they totally got it.\u00a0 (Hell, a lot of the people inside LFL have experience considerable harassment.\u00a0 I mean, that\u2019s not news, but Kelly Marie-Tran?\u00a0 Bueller?\u00a0 Bueller?)</p><p>After I did HYPERION with Marvel, they hired me then to write the TFA adaptation, which meant I got to work with some wonderful folks \u2013 @hantos and @cracksh0t \u2013 on a project that was tricky, because it ended up being more a translation of the movie than an adaptation.\u00a0 (I know Heather received some of the worst harassment in the entire industry \u2013 I can\u2019t speak to how well Marvel did or did not protect her from it, but I know she was at the bottom of a major misery funnel from Comicsgate and their ilk.\u00a0 Far worse than I suffered.)</p><p>Still, I thought things were good, and I hoped to do more work with Marvel or SW or a combo of the two someday \u2013 comics isn\u2019t really my \u201cthing,\u201d per se, but I felt like I was getting a handle on it.\u00a0 Of course, the harassment continued \u2013 and it got worse again when <i>TLJ </i>came out.\u00a0 Which I\u2019m sure is no surprise to anyone who has ever tweeted, \u201cHey, I really liked THE LAST JEDI!\u201d\u00a0 That\u2019s really when I started to see lots of YouTube videos and stuff about me and it was\u2026 Well, it was creepy.\u00a0 And I\u2019d seen other signs of people being\u2026 fired for political reasons, or folks like @ChelseaCain who was yanked around and was also the subject of considerable nastiness.</p><p>And then we announced SHADOW OF VADER juuuuust last weekend, and people were excited, and I thought everything was good.\u00a0 I was not made aware of any issues, and my online self has always been my online self, so.\u00a0 Except, yeah, no.\u00a0 Today I got the call.\u00a0 I\u2019m fired.\u00a0 Because of the negativity and vulgarity that my tweets bring.\u00a0 Seriously, that\u2019s what Mark, the editor said.\u00a0 It was too much politics, too much vulgarity, too much negativity on my part.</p><p>Basically, because I was not civil.</p><p>Which, of course, is their decision to make.\u00a0 I\u2019m not their boss.\u00a0 (And, turns out, they\u2019re not the boss of me, either.\u00a0 Har har.)\u00a0 (I joke because otherwise, I cry.)</p><p>My understanding over this call was that this was a Marvel decision, not an LFL decision, but I can\u2019t really confirm that.\u00a0 The editor said he had made the call.\u00a0 He seemed genuinely upset at my tweets and profanity, so maybe that\u2019s accurate.\u00a0 And again, that\u2019s his right to do so.\u00a0 If they honestly feel that my presence will damage the book, I don\u2019t want that.\u00a0 I want the book to shine, and artists like Juanan Ramirez and Greg Smallwood to do their amazing thing.\u00a0 Artists like that are gods in my mind, so I\u2019m happy to not distract from their literal magic.</p><p>But it does set a troubling precedent.\u00a0 One we\u2019ve seen already \u2013 James Gunn, Jessica White, and so on \u2013 of folks fired because they riled up the wasp\u2019s nest of asterisk-gate.\u00a0 And it seems odd to be mad that I\u2019m mad about politics when \u2013 well, look around.\u00a0 Climate change, kids in cages, sexual harassers at the topmost tiers of power, and so on.\u00a0 A call for civility as the PA GOP candidate threatens Tom Wolf with a golf cleat stomping.\u00a0 I dunno, man.</p><p>I know it hands Comicsgate a big win.\u00a0 It will embolden them.\u00a0 But they won \u2014 I\u2019m out of Marvel and, I guess for now, at least, out of any kind of Star Wars.\u00a0 Do your victory lap, I guess.\u00a0 (Just please leave me out of it.)\u00a0 (All that being said, a lot of wonderful people still work inside those institutions and storyworlds, and I hope you\u2019ll continue to support them and the stories they\u2019re telling.)\u00a0 To conclude: this is really quite chilling.\u00a0 And it breaks my heart.\u00a0 I am very sad, and worried for the country I live in, and the world, and for creative people all around.\u00a0 Courage to you all.\u00a0 I have a dire fear this is going to get a whole lot worse before it gets better.</p><p>P.S. Vote in November like your life depends on it.\u00a0 Because it just might.</p></blockquote><p>\u2014</p></p>",

Then it hits him all at once, the memory quick in creeping into his thoughts.</p><p>Something pulled the Star Destroyer off course. General Yoda, the trouble making little troll, seemed jumpier than usual. General Unduli said that she could sense something is about to happen and, due to his stronger connection to the Force, the older Jedi had a clearer idea on whatever is coming. Than a large ship came out of hyperspace.</p><p>It was larger than the<b> Malevolence</b>. That everyone could see for themselves. It was grander, and better equipped with an array of weapons only General Yoda seemed to recognize. The ship&rsquo;s crew had boarded and&hellip;</p><p>Gree shakes his head, shaking his thoughts free of the fog that clouds them. He doesn&rsquo;t remember what exactly happened after that. There were people in the vents, and arrows raining down and dropping clones like flies. Whatever those arrows did, they weren&rsquo;t killing his vode, just thoroughly knocked them out. General Unduli got hit and went down and, along with her padawan and General Yoda following close behind, one of the troopers had carried her to the bridge.</p><p>That&rsquo;s where things went downhill, and it was fast. The majority of the troopers went down fast, arrows quickly and easily getting past the armor. With only a few troopers left standing and the padawan in a drug induced sleep, the attackers had come out of their hiding space in the vents. What came out of those vents were a surprise to the clones still standing.</p><p>The majority were all members of General Yoda&rsquo;s species, a few Lanniks among the green- and brown-skinned group. All of them were equipped with a bow and a quiver of arrows, the arrow heads dipped in a shimmering substance, most likely what was knocking Gree&rsquo;s men and the Jedi out. All of them had swords scaled to their size on their hips, some with two while the rest with one, a few knives in clear view.</p><p>One of the green-skinned members of Yoda&rsquo;s species had stepped forward, a female with wavy black hair that reached her back and yellow eyes with flecks of green and amber. Janiel (Jane-e-el), the short General had called her. She hadn&rsquo;t answered, instead giving the other a tight-lipped smile, pulled her bow string taunt, and let an arrow loose. It was the last thing Gree remembers before waking in this hospital.</p><p>He sits up in the bed, running a hand down his face and briefly takes note of the small scar on his forehead before taking another look around the room. Seeing it more clearly know, Gree is reminded of the Main Hall of the Jedi&rsquo;s Halls of Healing. The large room is bathed in warm sunlight from the high windows on three walls and part of the ceiling. Lining the room are beds, several occupied by species he recognizes and a few more by those he doesn&rsquo;t, all injured or sick in one way or another. In the corner closest to him, Gree takes note of the two beds with curtains drawn around them, hiding the two patients there from view. Light brown stone pillars reach up to the ceiling, while small openings in the walls lead into who knows where.</p><p>Several people he assumes are healers move between the beds, checking over their patients as they ask them questions. One heads towards Gree, giving the clone a smile when he notices that he&rsquo;s awake. As the healer gets closer, Gree&rsquo;s eyebrows shoot up as he takes in the being getting closer.</p><p>He&rsquo;s tall, taller than a Wookie by a meter or two (10 feet/3.084 meters). Though human in looks, his facial structure looks more defined and angular, his dark brown hair looking more like feathers than the locks that humans and several humanoids have. Attached to his back are a large pair of wings that, by what Gree can tell, is a shade or two lighter than his hair, the edges of each feather white in color.</p><p>The healer stops next to the bed, grabbing the holo-pad hanging above and to the left of Gree&rsquo;s head.&nbsp;&ldquo;I am you&rsquo;re main healer during your stay here, Cain Skyland.&rdquo; The healer states, voice a deep rumble. &ldquo;Call me Healer Cain, and I&rsquo;m happy to see you awake, Commander. Your general and the rest of your legion were worried for you. You&rsquo;ve been out for a couple of days.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo; Gree asks, shooting a look towards the large doors at the other end of the room. If he was out that long, their main healer and at least several of his men should be close by.&nbsp;&ldquo;Where are they? Several of my men have a habit of staying close by if I&rsquo;m badly injured.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Most are in the mess.&rdquo; The near-human states, hanging the holo-pad back up.&nbsp;&ldquo;Your healers forced them to get something to eat when they refused what we have here after their release but refused to leave. Your general and some of your higher ranking men are here talking about what we found.&rdquo;</p><p>A smile crosses Gree&rsquo;s face before he frowns.&nbsp;&ldquo;Found? What did you find?&rdquo; Healer Cain sighs at the question, waving a hand. In response to the motion, one of the chairs stacked at the end of the room soars to them, causing Gree&rsquo;s eyebrow to rise in question. <i>Force-sensitive, huh?</i> The healer settles his tall form into the chair, wings shuffling around the back.</p><p>&ldquo;We found a chip of some kind inside your head&hellip; inside all of the men in your legion.&rdquo; Light eyes carefully watch Gree&rsquo;s face, gauging his reaction before the healer continues.&nbsp;&ldquo;We removed all of them, and you are the last trooper that is currently in the Halls. So far, our scientists have discovered that it&rsquo;s a biochip of some kind, and there are several hundred orders of unknown nature that will force every clone to follow. The High Councils believe that all of the clones have this biochip.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What do you want me to do with this information?&rdquo; Healer Cain smiles, leaning back in his chair as the large doors open. Three of his troopers follow General Unduli into the room, his Jedi&rsquo;s student speaking to two beings that barely reach her knees. The diminutive women give the young commander a tight-lipped smile, nodding their heads to the older Jedi before disappearing behind the curtains of the hidden beds. With a smile, General Unduli leads the group to Gree&rsquo;s bed.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, Commander,&rdquo; General Unduli starts,&nbsp;&ldquo;we have a plan.&rdquo;<br /></p></p>",
