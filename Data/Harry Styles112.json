To his surprise she pulls him into a hug and kisses him on the cheek like they are really close friends when in fact it takes him a few seconds of stuttering to remember her name. </p><p>\u201cHey, <i>Rose</i>.\u201d He presses his lips into a small smile and subtly takes a step backward to keep a distance between them. \u201cHere to see <i>Mr. Boss</i>?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGee, he told everyone to call him that?\u201d Rose laughs, shaking her head, making Harry laugh along.</p><p>Rose is his new boss\u2019 daughter, 20-year-old, still in university, a fashion student. Harry met her the first time at her father\u2019s charity event, then the next two times when she came here to see her father, though everyone in the company says she shows up regularly only to see Harry. Harry himself, on the other hand, doesn\u2019t think too much about her reason. Her dad owns this place so she can come however often she wants; besides, he\u2019s already engaged, so this young girl\u2019s little crush on him (if there is one) is insignificant.</p><p>\u201cCongrats on getting your own office! Daddy couldn\u2019t stop talking about you,\u201d says Rose with a lovely smile as she tiptoes to look over his shoulder into his new office. Now Harry understands why everyone here loves her, it\u2019s not just the fact that she\u2019s pretty and always so well-dressed,\u00a0she also carries a positive energy to every room she walks in.</p><p>\u201cThank you. I\u2019m very flattered,\u201d he replies and is\u00a0just about to leave, but Rose continues talking in order to keep the conversation going.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know much about how this <i>whole</i> thing works&hellip;\u201d She circles her finger in the air, rolling her eyes \u201c&hellip;but daddy told me even his most hard-to-please clients loved you and <i>that </i>contract you got for him was one of the biggest ones this year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for your father\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe also said you were humble,\u201d Rose cuts him off, biting back a smile as she stares at Harry. \u201cI guess you\u2019re going to his annual dinner party right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019ve been told.\u201d He nods, shoving two hands in his pockets. \u201cWhat\u2019s the story behind your father\u2019s tradition though?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOooh, the <i>second</i>\u00a0Wednesday of February, the <i>second</i> month of the year, is his lucky day so he throws a fancy dinner party every year on this day and invites all business partners and friends, many important people are gonna be there. He wouldn\u2019t invite just <i>any</i> employee, that person has to earn it, and I guess you\u2019re <i>that person</i>, he wants to show you off.\u201d</p><p>Harry starts beaming as soon as he hears the compliment. He cannot wait to tell his fianc\u00e9 about this.</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s a plus-one party, has daddy told you? He\u2019s very serious about the number <i>two</i>\u00a0so every guest who comes has to bring someone or else they\u2019re not allowed to enter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, he told me that as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuper! If you want I can\u2014\u201c</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m taking my fianc\u00e9 as my plus one,\u201d Harry says quickly, not giving the girl a chance to finish her suggestion. Rose stares at the older man, eyes widened as she releases a soft chuckle.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not engaged.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d He proudly smiles. \u201cI\u2019ll introduce you two at the party. You\u2019re gonna love Y/N.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow, um&hellip;I\u2019m sure she\u2019s a nice person.\u201d Rose smiles back, the disappointment on her face is definitely recognizable.</p><p>\u201cI must get back to work now, we\u2019ll chat another time yeah?\u201d Harry tells the girl, patting her slightly on the arm and walking off. Rose turns her head, frowning as her eyes follow him until he\u2019s out of sight. </p>",

Please don\u2019t do that.\u201d He grabbed on to the wheel as he saw you close your eyes.

Let\u2019s go back in time shall we?\u201d\u00a0You squealed in excitement when the familiar tune started playing thru the speakers.</p><p>\u00a0<i>\n\nIsn&rsquo;t she lovely<br/>Isn&rsquo;t she wonderful<br/>Isn&rsquo;t she precious<br/>Less than one minute old<br/>I never thought through love we&rsquo;d be<br/>Making one as lovely as she<br/>But isn&rsquo;t she lovely made from love</i></p><p><i>Isn&rsquo;t she pretty<br/>Truly the angel&rsquo;s best<br/>Boy, I&rsquo;m so happy<br/>We have been heaven blessed<br/>I can&rsquo;t believe what God has done<br/>Through us he&rsquo;s given life to one<br/>But isn&rsquo;t she lovely made from love\n\n</i></p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cOh my God. I remember watching your audition and I got goosebumps all over. Look,\u201d You held your arm out in front of him ,\u00a0\u201cand you still manage to give me goosebumps again.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u201cI was really nervous that day. I don\u2019t know if you could notice it.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u201cNo , not even one bit. But I do remember the OUTFITS!\u201d You cackle. Harry covered his face to hide the smile playing on his lips.\u00a0\u201cI mean , we\u2019ve all had that phase.\u201d You tell him to make him feel better. \u201cI have pictures of me in just really really , you know , just\u00a0dark edgy outfits. And not the fashionable kind. I had a bunch of band t-shirts that I paired with checkered skinny jeans and animal beanies and God it was bad.\u201d You scrunch your face up at the memory. \u201cAnd it was all heavy eyeliner and my arms were covered in bracelets up to my elbow. I can\u2019t believe my mom let me go out like that.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u201cYou have to let me see those pictures.\u201d He laughs.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u201cNo way!

You saw all of mine.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u00a0\u201cBecause they were pap shots.\u201d You mocked him.\u00a0\u201cI actually probably burned all of them if I\u2019m honest.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u201cYou listened to a lot of rock music back in the day then?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOh yeah.\u201d You nodded.\u00a0\u201cStill do. My taste in music is all over the place. If I like I like it , really. But really my heart will always belong to punk rock.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u00a0\u201cSo do you know this one?\u201d He smirks. You pause the song when you recognize it and look at Harry.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cYou know I do! But its gonna have to be all you , because I will literally shatter all the windows on this car if I even attempt to sing this.\u201d Harry ignores you and plays the song.\u00a0\u201cOh my god.\u201d\u00a0</p><p><i>\n\nLoad up on guns, bring your friends<br/>It&rsquo;s fun to lose and to pretend<br/>She&rsquo;s over-bored and self-assured<br/>Oh no, I know a dirty word</i></p><p><i>Hello, hello, hello, how low<br/>Hello, hello, hello, how low<br/>Hello, hello, hello, how low<br/>Hello, hello, hello</i></p><p>You look out the window and notice the girls in the car next to you are waving at you while recording you with their cellphones in their other hand. You tap Harry and he props himself up on his arm to look over. He waves at them and tells them to sing with you two.</p><p><i>With the lights out, it&rsquo;s less dangerous<br/>Here we are now, entertain us<br/>I feel stupid and contagious<br/>Here we are now, entertain us<br/>A mulatto, an albino, a mosquito, my libido<br/>Yeah, hey</i></p><p><i>\u00a0</i>The car behind you honks for you to go and you wave at them before speeding off.\u00a0\u201cThat was good.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u201cI heard you used to have a lot of One Direction poster sin your room when you were younger.\u201d Harry giggles.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cI did. And I have no shame.\u201d You point out.\u00a0\u201cPlus I know my sister told you and I know she\u2019s gonna watch this so,\u201d You look directly in to the camera ,\u00a0\u201cyou better watch your back cuz you\u2019re gonna pay for revealing classified information.\u201d You joke.\u00a0\u201cPlus,\u201d you turn your attention back to Harry,\u00a0\u201cit\u2019s not like every other girl in the world didn\u2019t have posters of you boys at one point in their life.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u201cYou were a pretty big fan then?\u201d You nod. \u201cWell then let\u2019s play a game. I\u2019ll play a song and we have to figure out what lyric comes after.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u201cI am gonna murder you in this game. I know ALL of them.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u201cI was in the band!\u201d He argues.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u201cYeah , yeah.\u201d You wave a dismissive hand at him.\u00a0\u201cAre we doing all the albums or?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u201cAll of the albums. Are you ready?\u201d He says as he holds the phone in his hands.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cI was born ready , baby.\u201d He laughs and presses play.</p><p><i>Now I\u2019m climbing the walls. But you don\u2019t notice at all. That I\u2019m going out of my mind. All day and All night.</i></p><p>\u201cEasy!\u201d You yell when he presses pause.\u00a0\u201c<i>So get out , get out get outta my head. And fall in to my arms instead. I don\u2019t , I don\u2019t don\u2019t know what it is. but I need that one thing</i>.\u201d You belt out with passion.<br/></p><p>\u00a0\u201cI gave you an easy one. Ok , next one.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0<i>Let me be the one to lift your heart up and save your life. I don\u2019t think you even realize Baby , you\u2019d be saving mine. Diana</i></p><p>\u201cOh shit.\u201d You laugh.\u00a0\u201cWait no, I know this.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u00a0Harry cups his hands over his mouth ,\u00a0\u201cFake fan. Fake fan.\u201d He chants.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cNo! I know this one..\u201d you tap your fingers on the steering wheel impatiently,\u00a0\u201cOk no. I don\u2019t know.\u201d You slowly lower your head so your forehead is resting on the steering wheel and fake sob when you reach the stoplight.</p><p>\u00a0Harry mockingly clears his throat,\u00a0<i>\u201cIt\u2019s only been four months but you\u2019ve fallen down so far. How could someone mislead you at all? I wanna reach out for ya. I wanna break these walls. I speak a different language But I still hear your call.\u201d </i>He sings.<i>\u00a0</i>You turn your head to face him and he pretends to drop a mic.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re tied! So it doesn\u2019t count.\u201d You sit up straight again. You focus back on the road as Harry chooses another song.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u00a0And I can lend you broken parts That might fit like this And I will give you all my heart So we can start it all over again</p><p>\u00a0\u201c<i>Again we can take the same road two days in the same clothes And I know just what she\u2019ll say if we i can make all this pain go Can we stop this for a minute You know I can tell you that your heart isn\u2019t in it or with it. Tell me with your mind body and spirit , I can make your tears fall down like the showers that are British</i>,\u201d You drag a fake tear down your cheek ,\u00a0\u201c<i>whether we\u2019re together or apart We can both remove the masks and admit that we regret it from the start. If you\u2019re-</i>\u201d Harry places a hand over your mouth.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cI get it. You know the lyrics.\u201d He deadpans.\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re so competitive.\u201d He jokes.</p><p>\u00a0Your jaw drops at his comment ,\u00a0\u201cme? Look who\u2019s talking.\u201d You laugh.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cLast one.\u201d</p><p><i>I aint up for debating , Aint enough for the taking , You got the whole world shaking.</i></p><p><i>\u00a0\u201cin the middle of the night when the wolves come out , headed straight for your heart like a bullet in the dark. One by one , I gotta take them down But you run and hide , aint goin down without a fight.\u201d </i>You and Harry sing in unison.</p><p>\u201cNo , it\u2019s almost over.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u00a0\u201cThank God. I\u2019m starting to lose my hearing.\u201d He covers his ears.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cRude.\u201d He laughs and reaches over to give you a quick squeeze.\u00a0\u201cAnyway,\u201d you playfully push him away,\u00a0\u201cthis last one is one of my favorites. So we\u2019re gonna do something big.\u201d You smile mischievously.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u201cNow I\u2019m really scared.\u201d He tells you as you pull in to a parking lot of a bar. You hand him a blindfold and he hesitates before grabbing it form your hand.\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re joking?\u201d You smile as you shake your head.\u00a0\u201cYou know this is recording right?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u201cHarry , just put it on.\u201d You tell him before stepping out of the car.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re missing the main part of carpool karaoke.\u201d He yells at you before you slam the driver\u2019s door shut. You wait for him to put on the blindfold before grabbing his hand and helping him out of the car.\u00a0\u201cThe last time I went along with something like this , a stripper was involved.\u201d He told you as you continued to lead him.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u201cYeah , well you\u2019re not getting that lucky today.\u201d You stopped when you finally made it inside.\u00a0\u201cOn the count of three,\u201d you let go of his arm and walked away from him ,\u00a0\u201ctake off the blindfold. One , two , three.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u201cHappy birthday to you,\u201d you , his mom , Gemma, James and a few of his other friends began to sing when he removed the blindfold. He couldn\u2019t help the grin that made its way on to his face. Anne lit the candles on his cake as everyone continued to sing. He wiped away the tears of job from his eyes before they could make their way down his face.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u201cYou were in on this?\u201d He points to James as he walks over to him when you had all finished singing. James just laughs and gives Harry a tight hug. He makes his way around the bar hugging and thanking all of his guests.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cHey. Don\u2019t forget to blow out the candles.\u201d You call to him. He rushes back tot he table where the cake is ,\u00a0\u201cMake a wish birthday boy.\u201d You smirk.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cI think you know what I want.\u201d He whispers to you , before lowering himself and blowing out the candles.\u00a0</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-</p><p>Part 2 COMING SOON\u00a0</p>",

You hand him a blindfold and he hesitates before grabbing it form your hand.\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re joking?\u201d You smile as you shake your head.\u00a0\u201cYou know this is recording right?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u201cHarry , just put it on.\u201d You tell him before stepping out of the car.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re missing the main part of carpool karaoke.\u201d He yells at you before you slam the driver\u2019s door shut. You wait for him to put on the blindfold before grabbing his hand and helping him out of the car.\u00a0\u201cThe last time I went along with something like this , a stripper was involved.\u201d He told you as you continued to lead him.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u201cYeah , well you\u2019re not getting that lucky today.\u201d You stopped when you finally made it inside.\u00a0\u201cOn the count of three,\u201d you let go of his arm and walked away from him ,\u00a0\u201ctake off the blindfold. One , two , three.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u201cHappy birthday to you,\u201d you , his mom , Gemma, James and a few of his other friends began to sing when he removed the blindfold. He couldn\u2019t help the grin that made its way on to his face. Anne lit the candles on his cake as everyone continued to sing. He wiped away the tears of job from his eyes before they could make their way down his face.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u201cYou were in on this?\u201d He points to James as he walks over to him when you had all finished singing. James just laughs and gives Harry a tight hug. He makes his way around the bar hugging and thanking all of his guests.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cHey. Don\u2019t forget to blow out the candles.\u201d You call to him. He rushes back tot he table where the cake is ,\u00a0\u201cMake a wish birthday boy.\u201d You smirk.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cI think you know what I want.\u201d He whispers to you , before lowering himself and blowing out the candles.\u00a0</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-</p><p>Part 2 COMING SOON\u00a0</p>",
