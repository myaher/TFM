You\u2019re filled to the brim with comebacks and sarcastic remarks just as a birthright. But even with all the riches and fame that came with your name you still managed to be incredibly kind and humble. But somehow you had the absolute worst taste in boys (yes boys because they were certainly not men). Somewhere deep in your messed up brain you had convinced yourself that you didn\u2019t deserve nice guys, but even deeper in your brain you knew that it was a way for your dad to notice you more. Yes of course he was proud of you and loved you like no other but he was a busy man, and of course you understood;I mean saving the planet on multiple occasions was time consuming. But, he would always be to deep in his work to take time for you, he missed a lot of special occasions in your life. Like your first day at midtown (he didn\u2019t even say goodbye before you left or wish you good luck). You had always been homeschooled because Tony wanted to ensure you got the best possible education, but he knew you needed to be properly socialized and have friends that were your age and not super soldiers. He would make up for it with expensive gifts, but nothing beat spending time with the old man. </p><p>You had been going to midtown for at least a year now and you were part way through your sophmore year. You fit in very well with the other students, you easily fell in with the popular crowd with your charisma and beauty, and thankfully not for your last name you enrolled under a completely different last name, people just thought it was a coincidence that you looked like the famous (y/n) Stark. But even with rolling with the cool kids you were never rude like some of them were to other students. Like how Flash was rude to Peter Parker, you always stood up for Peter through Flash\u2019s torments. You and Peter we\u2019re good friends, you of course had figured out his secret identity from your father, but before that you were good friends from Academic Decathlon and you were really good study buddies. You weren&rsquo;t the type to be ashamed of friendships so you made it appoint to express your friendship with your particular crowd so they know not to pick on him when you\u2019re around. With riding with the popular crowd, and having a bad taste in boys, you had a bountiful amount of boys to choose from. </p><p>Since arriving at midtown you\u2019ve dated five guys,including your current boyfriend. First way, Brett the bad boy, he had a motorcycle that your father hated but he never expressed concern because he thought you were happy. Also, Chad the fuck boy who only cared about trying to sleep with you, you being the strong powerful woman you are ended that relationship quickly. Next was Charlie the heartbreaker, sure he seemed nice enough and you really liked him, you even both said you loved each other, but he cheated on you with multiple girls and left you heartbroken, he was the longest relationship you ever had. Peter being the sweetest guy ever came by and was your shoulder to cry on, which was the first time you had ever cried in front of someone ever. After Charlie you didn\u2019t date for awhile at least until halfway through the summer before sophomore year. That\u2019s when you met Ethan the extortionist, he seemed so sweet, but then again they all do, he only wanted to date you because you were a stark and knew the avengers. Now you were a very smart girl but as some might say you were quite stupid with love so you didn\u2019t notice the blatentness of him trying to obtain what you had, but once you finally did you were quick to dump him. Rightnow you were dating Harry, he was extremely attractive but also very possessive and insecure, he did not like the fact that you had any guy friends at all but that never stopped you from continuing to talk to Peter. </p><p>Little did you know that Peter had a massive sized crush on you. He loved the way you talked about anything and everything, especially the things you were passionate about. He loved when you snorted a little when you laughed to hard, or how you were popular but never were ashamed of your friendship with him. Peter also loved when you guys were studying and you would get so frustrated with sitting for so long and force him to have a dance party with you. He loved how happy you\u2019d get when you would ace a test or win a round in Academic Decathlon. Or the way your (y/e/c) eyes would shine with glee all the time. Peter loved everything about you, well except for one thing, your boyfriends. Peter hated them, they were all total douchebags and either only liked you for your money, that is if they knew you were a stark, or they only thought you were some pretty face that they thought they could sleep with or manipulate. But you were so much more than that because yes, you were pretty but you were so smart and funny too and a big geek. He was there during every start and end of the relationships, you cried on his very shoulder after you found out Charlie cheated on you. But Harry was one of the worst boyfriends ever, he was violent and possessive and very much didn\u2019t like Peter. But he was glad that you never backed down to Harry and continued to be his friend.</p><p>At this point you and Harry had been dating for one month so nothing to serious has happened yet except kissing but that seemed like preschool stuff to you at this point. Harry and you were hanging in your room at the tower watching Parks and Rec one of your favorite shows, Harry didn&rsquo;t really get the jokes but you didn&rsquo;t care. You had invited peter over to study later but after you assumed Harry would be gone. Peter would be arriving in the next thirty minutes or so you turned to Harry.</p><p>\u201cHey\u2026so I have a family thing in about thirty minutes so you might need to get going in a bit.\u201d you said giving his hand a squeeze.</p><p>\u201cYeah sure babe, i\u2019ll get going here in a second, i just need to go to the bathroom real quick.\u201d Harry said kissing your cheek.</p><p>When Harry had to go to the bathroom \u2018real quick\u2019 it differently did not mean \u2018real quick\u2019 it would definitely take a while. So you took this opportunity to change into more comfortable clothes comparatively to your school clothes. You knew it wouldn&rsquo;t look like you had a family thing but Harry wasn\u2019t the brightest crayon in the box, so you didn\u2019t really care. You began stripping from your clothes before you went to find your clothes to change into. You looked down to see that you were wearing mismatched underwear, not that you necessarily tried to match, it just these exact pairs were quite strange. First a bra from a long time ago, still cute thought, and secondly, days of the week lacy underwear that was for monday, which was definitely not the day today. You laughed at the haphazard dressing skills you had especially when it was around laundry day. You were fishing around for clothes when a knock came at the door.</p><p>\u201cWho is it?\u201d You asked absent minded.</p><p>\u201cPeter!\u201d Peter yelled back from the other side of the door.</p><p>\u201cCome in!\u201d You said without another thought, of your current state of nakedness.</p><p>\u201cSorry i\u2019m early bu-AH!\u201d Peter said coming in when he noticed you half naked in your room, he quickly cover his eyes and turned around being the gentleman he was but not before looking at your figure, he couldn\u2019t help how his hormones took control. He took notice of how your underwear read \u201cmonday\u201d when it was in fact a Wednesday.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it Pete?\u201d You said worried at his scream, before realizing that you were just standing around half naked.</p><p>Peter was still turned around and you walked up to him, still naked and started apologizing.</p><p>\u201cOh Peter i\u2019m so sorry i totally forgot i was in the middle of changing and i just heard your name so i just let you in without even thinking, oh i\u2019m just so sorry!\u201d You said touching his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cWhat is going on! What is that dip whad doing here babe! Also why the fuck are you half naked!\u201d Harry started yelling</p><p>You turned to him and began explaining what was happening so fast, but about three seconds into your explanations he totally decked peter with a punch, and continued to punch him. You were utterly shocked by his actions, you quickly came to your senses and tried to get him off Peter, yelling at him to stop.</p><p>\u201cHarry! Get off him!!\u201d You screamed in desperation.</p><p>Harry finally stops and gets up from the ground.</p><p>\u201c (Y/N) I told you to stop hanging out with this, this nerd! I can\u2019t believe you let him see you like that, your mine and no one else\u2019s so you better stop seeing him if you want to be with me!\u201d Harry yelled at you.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not your property Harry! You don\u2019t get to dictate my life and tell me who i can and can\u2019t be friend with Harry! Oh incase you haven\u2019t noticed i\u2019m a nerd too! I would never change myself, my interests, or my friends for anyone! So if you can\u2019t except that then we\u2019re over!\u201d You yelled right back with even more fury than him.</p><p>\u201cActually,\u201d you started again, \u201cI think you and your toxic masculinity, insecurities, and possessiveness and leave my life! Don\u2019t let the door hit you on the way out!\u201d You yelled</p><p>Harry left out a huff and left the room and stormed out of the tour.</p><p>\u201cAre you alright Peter, i\u2019m so sorry, I\u2019ll clean you up i\u2019m so, so, so, so sorry!\u201d You say as you move to get a first aid kit.</p><p>You began addressing his wounds and cleaning his face with a wet towel and alcohol, putting your dads favorite hello kitty band-aids on the cut on his cheek. Peter didn\u2019t look at you while you did this, it wasn\u2019t required of him to do this it was just odd behavior for him. Another piece of odd behavior was how he didn\u2019t fight back, he was 100% stronger than Brett being spider-man and all, so he could have easily win the fight.</p><p>\u201cRiddle me this Spider-man, you are incredible strong, i mean you stopped a bus with your bare hands, well i guess gloved in that instance, and yet you didn\u2019t even try to hit Harry back? Why is that? Also why aren\u2019t you looking at me?\u201d You questioned Peter while you placed another band-aid on his face.</p><p>Peter blushed slightly at the mention of his alter ego, along with the fact that you just called him strong, \u201cWell i\u2019m not looking at you because you are still half naked (y/n),\u201d you giggled at the first half of his response and quickly apologized before putting on a crewneck and shorts to later study in. \u201cand I didn&rsquo;t want to throw a punch because I didn\u2019t want you to think of me like the violent type.\u201d Peter said now looking at you dressed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry Harry was such a jerk, i should have realized sooner and broken up with him, he didn\u2019t like Parks and Rec so that should have been my first sign.\u201d You said laughing a little at your last comment</p><p>\u201cHow does he not like that show it&rsquo;s the bomb!\u201d Peter said with a smile.</p><p>\u201cI know right!\u201d You smile back basking in the happy moment and laughs that filled the air.</p><p>\u201cBut why do you date these jerks anyway? You\u2019re so smart and funny and amazing and beautiful you deserve someone way better then them.\u201d Peter said</p><p>You smiled at the praise he offered you, \u201cYou really think i\u2019m all of those things Peter,\u201d he nodded intensely sitting up to sit beside you on the ground, \u201cWell i don&rsquo;t know why i date them, but yeah i guess they have all been jerks, i guess being the daughter of Tony Stark really puts a target on my back for being used, i don\u2019t really know Peter I don\u2019t think nice guys like me\u201d You say sighing. All your reasonings weren\u2019t that valid but you didn\u2019t want to tell Peter the real reason.</p><p>Peter tried to fight his brain into not admitting his feeling for you right in that moment because of how bad the timing was with you just breaking up with Harry, but Peter lost that battle and blurted out, \u201cI like you! And i\u2019m pretty nice\u2026 i think. And not just like you like a friend but, like you like you, god how many times have i said like.\u201d Peter awkwardly stuttered out in the cutest way.</p><p>\u201cAnd I know it\u2019s bad timing in all to tell you that (y/n), and it&rsquo;s totally ok if you don&rsquo;t feel the same, oh go i hope i didn\u2019t mess up our friendship&hellip;i probably did, oh god (y/n) just forget i said anything. But you\u2019re still amazing and deserve the best.\u201d Peter rambled as you watched him with admiration as he told you how he felt.</p><p>He continued to ramble before you try to interrupt.</p><p>\u201cPeter\u2026\u201dYou said, he continued, \u201cPETER!\u201d you said louder grabbing his attention.</p><p>\u201cIf you could stop rambling for a second, despite how adorable it is, i would be able to tell you that i like you too.\u201d You said with a smile.</p><p>Peter looked wide eyed and stared at you with heart eyes. Then you leaned in a kissed him softly on the lips, he was shocked at first but quickly leaned into it and moved his lips along with yours. It lasted like this for awhile before you both had to pull away to take breath. You both looked into each others eyes lovingly.</p><p>\u201cThe real reason why i date bad guys is to get my Dad\u2019s attention.\u201d You said quickly</p><p>Peter looked at you before speaking, \u201cMaybe you should talk to him about that,\u201d He said and you nodded, \u201cPlus the sooner you get back the sooner we can study, and makeout&hellip;but mainly makeout.\u201d Peter said with a sudden burst of confidence. You laughed at his cockyness and threw a pillow at him.</p><p>\u201cOk i\u2019m going to talk to to my dad, but i will be back\u201d You say with wink over your shoulder.</p><p>\u201cHey (Y/N)?\u201d Peter asks</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d You saying turning around in the door frame in the doorframe.</p><p>\u201cYou know it\u2019s Wednesday right?\u201d Peter asks with a slight smirk.</p><p>\u201cUh, yeah why do you think i don\u2019t\u2026\u201d You pause remembering your underwear.</p><p>You run up and hit him in the shoulder hard. He winces in pain.</p><p>\u201cOwww! I can\u2019t help it your butt was screaming at be that it was monday! I couldn\u2019t not take a peek!i\u2019m sorry!\u201d Peter says laughing, you\u2019re laughing too as you begin walking away towards the door again. You look over your shoulder catching Peter checking you out, he quickly becomes flustered and turns away from your gaze.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be back soon cutie!\u201d You call as you exit your room.</p><p>You walk around the tower heading toward your dad\u2019s lab were you knew you could find him, working on another extension of the iron man suit or a new upgrade. You finally arrived at the doorway to the lab, you suck in a deep breath and sigh then continue to type in your specific lab code that granted you access. Of course you had your own code because you loved working on new tech in there all the time, or assisting Dr. Banner. The lab door unlocked, you pushed it open trying to quietly sneak into not scare your dad. But the loud rock music was blaring so remaining quite was unnecessary. You walked up to your dad\u2019s work space, he noticed your movement and turned down the music.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up sugar plum? Jarvis told me that Harold walked out in quite the fit of rage\u201d Tony said bringing back your old childhood nickname. As he looked in your eyes he could see that you were upset about something.</p><p>\u201cHis name is Harry, but that doesn\u2019t even matter anymore because we broke up.\u201d You said.</p><p>\u201cWell good, i didn\u2019t like that guy anyway, total douche.\u201d Tony said with a smile, trying to make you feel better.</p><p>\u201cThen why didn\u2019t you say anything Dad!\u201d You said getting more upset.</p><p>Tony is taken off guard by your sudden outburst toward him, \u201cWell i thought you we\u2019re happy with him and i wouldn\u2019t want to impose on that for you sweetie.\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo dad! I only date these jerks because i want your attention! I know that\u2019s not a good reason, i just want you to take interest in my life! I know you\u2019re busy saving the world and it seems selfish to ask but it would be nice to spend a little time with you!\u201d You said with slight tears brimming in your eyes.</p><p>Tony pulled you into a big hug after you said this, you quickly relaxed into his hold of you.</p><p>\u201cOf course i want to spend time with you (Y/N) i love you so much! And i will admit i get a little carried away my work.\u201dTony said with a smile</p><p>\u201cA little?\u201d You questioned with a laugh.</p><p>Tony laughed before he spoke, \u201cHow about every night we both agree to have a family dinner, and you can spend more time with me in the lab, i mean you\u2019re smarter than me so i need all the help i can get in here!\u201d </p><p>You smiled at his compliments of you before leaning out of the hug to look him in the eye to respond, \u201cI would love that dad!\u201d </p><p>You both hug again before you turn back out and say, \u201cOh i have to go I left Peter by himself in my room, and we need to study for our chem rest next thursday.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh! Speaking of the Spiderling i have a question for you.\u201d Tony says with a smirk on his face.</p><p>\u201cYeah what is it?\u201d You ask feigning innocence </p><p>\u201cWhy was he in your room while you were half naked?\u201d Tony said chuckling but with a seriousness in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cUhhhhh&hellip; long story, but a total accident! I gotta go!!\u201d You said running out of there as fast as possible.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not done with this conversation young lady!\u201d Tony yells back at you as you run away.</p><p>You smile as you run knowing this would be a new begining with both Peter and your dad. You walked back into your room and planted a kiss on Peter\u2019s lips, ready to jump into happily ever after. Now you will have dated six people in your life but needless to say that Peter was the last one you ever needed to date.</p>",

You\u2019re filled to the brim with comebacks and sarcastic remarks just as a birthright. But even with all the riches and fame that came with your name you still managed to be incredibly kind and humble. But somehow you had the absolute worst taste in boys (yes boys because they were certainly not men). Somewhere deep in your messed up brain you had convinced yourself that you didn\u2019t deserve nice guys, but even deeper in your brain you knew that it was a way for your dad to notice you more. Yes of course he was proud of you and loved you like no other but he was a busy man, and of course you understood;I mean saving the planet on multiple occasions was time consuming. But, he would always be to deep in his work to take time for you, he missed a lot of special occasions in your life. Like your first day at midtown (he didn\u2019t even say goodbye before you left or wish you good luck). You had always been homeschooled because Tony wanted to ensure you got the best possible education, but he knew you needed to be properly socialized and have friends that were your age and not super soldiers. He would make up for it with expensive gifts, but nothing beat spending time with the old man. </p><p>You had been going to midtown for at least a year now and you were part way through your sophmore year. You fit in very well with the other students, you easily fell in with the popular crowd with your charisma and beauty, and thankfully not for your last name you enrolled under a completely different last name, people just thought it was a coincidence that you looked like the famous (y/n) Stark. But even with rolling with the cool kids you were never rude like some of them were to other students. Like how Flash was rude to Peter Parker, you always stood up for Peter through Flash\u2019s torments. You and Peter we\u2019re good friends, you of course had figured out his secret identity from your father, but before that you were good friends from Academic Decathlon and you were really good study buddies. You weren\u2019t the type to be ashamed of friendships so you made it appoint to express your friendship with your particular crowd so they know not to pick on him when you\u2019re around. With riding with the popular crowd, and having a bad taste in boys, you had a bountiful amount of boys to choose from. </p><p>Since arriving at midtown you\u2019ve dated five guys,including your current boyfriend. First way, Brett the bad boy, he had a motorcycle that your father hated but he never expressed concern because he thought you were happy. Also, Chad the fuck boy who only cared about trying to sleep with you, you being the strong powerful woman you are ended that relationship quickly. Next was Charlie the heartbreaker, sure he seemed nice enough and you really liked him, you even both said you loved each other, but he cheated on you with multiple girls and left you heartbroken, he was the longest relationship you ever had. Peter being the sweetest guy ever came by and was your shoulder to cry on, which was the first time you had ever cried in front of someone ever. After Charlie you didn\u2019t date for awhile at least until halfway through the summer before sophomore year. That\u2019s when you met Ethan the extortionist, he seemed so sweet, but then again they all do, he only wanted to date you because you were a stark and knew the avengers. Now you were a very smart girl but as some might say you were quite stupid with love so you didn\u2019t notice the blatentness of him trying to obtain what you had, but once you finally did you were quick to dump him. Rightnow you were dating Harry, he was extremely attractive but also very possessive and insecure, he did not like the fact that you had any guy friends at all but that never stopped you from continuing to talk to Peter. </p><p>Little did you know that Peter had a massive sized crush on you. He loved the way you talked about anything and everything, especially the things you were passionate about. He loved when you snorted a little when you laughed to hard, or how you were popular but never were ashamed of your friendship with him. Peter also loved when you guys were studying and you would get so frustrated with sitting for so long and force him to have a dance party with you. He loved how happy you\u2019d get when you would ace a test or win a round in Academic Decathlon. Or the way your (y/e/c) eyes would shine with glee all the time. Peter loved everything about you, well except for one thing, your boyfriends. Peter hated them, they were all total douchebags and either only liked you for your money, that is if they knew you were a stark, or they only thought you were some pretty face that they thought they could sleep with or manipulate. But you were so much more than that because yes, you were pretty but you were so smart and funny too and a big geek. He was there during every start and end of the relationships, you cried on his very shoulder after you found out Charlie cheated on you. But Harry was one of the worst boyfriends ever, he was violent and possessive and very much didn\u2019t like Peter. But he was glad that you never backed down to Harry and continued to be his friend.</p><p>At this point you and Harry had been dating for one month so nothing to serious has happened yet except kissing but that seemed like preschool stuff to you at this point. Harry and you were hanging in your room at the tower watching Parks and Rec one of your favorite shows, Harry didn\u2019t really get the jokes but you didn\u2019t care. You had invited peter over to study later but after you assumed Harry would be gone. Peter would be arriving in the next thirty minutes or so you turned to Harry.</p><p>\u201cHey\u2026so I have a family thing in about thirty minutes so you might need to get going in a bit.\u201d you said giving his hand a squeeze.</p><p>\u201cYeah sure babe, i\u2019ll get going here in a second, i just need to go to the bathroom real quick.\u201d Harry said kissing your cheek.</p><p>When Harry had to go to the bathroom \u2018real quick\u2019 it differently did not mean \u2018real quick\u2019 it would definitely take a while. So you took this opportunity to change into more comfortable clothes comparatively to your school clothes. You knew it wouldn\u2019t look like you had a family thing but Harry wasn\u2019t the brightest crayon in the box, so you didn\u2019t really care. You began stripping from your clothes before you went to find your clothes to change into. You looked down to see that you were wearing mismatched underwear, not that you necessarily tried to match, it just these exact pairs were quite strange. First a bra from a long time ago, still cute thought, and secondly, days of the week lacy underwear that was for monday, which was definitely not the day today. You laughed at the haphazard dressing skills you had especially when it was around laundry day. You were fishing around for clothes when a knock came at the door.</p><p>\u201cWho is it?\u201d You asked absent minded.</p><p>\u201cPeter!\u201d Peter yelled back from the other side of the door.</p><p>\u201cCome in!\u201d You said without another thought, of your current state of nakedness.</p><p>\u201cSorry i\u2019m early bu-AH!\u201d Peter said coming in when he noticed you half naked in your room, he quickly cover his eyes and turned around being the gentleman he was but not before looking at your figure, he couldn\u2019t help how his hormones took control. He took notice of how your underwear read \u201cmonday\u201d when it was in fact a Wednesday.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it Pete?\u201d You said worried at his scream, before realizing that you were just standing around half naked.</p><p>Peter was still turned around and you walked up to him, still naked and started apologizing.</p><p>\u201cOh Peter i\u2019m so sorry i totally forgot i was in the middle of changing and i just heard your name so i just let you in without even thinking, oh i\u2019m just so sorry!\u201d You said touching his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cWhat is going on! What is that dip whad doing here babe! Also why the fuck are you half naked!\u201d Harry started yelling</p><p>You turned to him and began explaining what was happening so fast, but about three seconds into your explanations he totally decked peter with a punch, and continued to punch him. You were utterly shocked by his actions, you quickly came to your senses and tried to get him off Peter, yelling at him to stop.</p><p>\u201cHarry! Get off him!!\u201d You screamed in desperation.</p><p>Harry finally stops and gets up from the ground.</p><p>\u201c (Y/N) I told you to stop hanging out with this, this nerd! I can\u2019t believe you let him see you like that, your mine and no one else\u2019s so you better stop seeing him if you want to be with me!\u201d Harry yelled at you.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not your property Harry!

Peter didn\u2019t look at you while you did this, it wasn\u2019t required of him to do this it was just odd behavior for him.

And i\u2019m pretty nice\u2026 i think. And not just like you like a friend but, like you like you, god how many times have i said like.\u201d Peter awkwardly stuttered out in the cutest way.</p><p>\u201cAnd I know it\u2019s bad timing in all to tell you that (y/n), and it\u2019s totally ok if you don\u2019t feel the same, oh go i hope i didn\u2019t mess up our friendship\u2026i probably did, oh god (y/n) just forget i said anything. But you\u2019re still amazing and deserve the best.\u201d Peter rambled as you watched him with admiration as he told you how he felt.</p><p>He continued to ramble before you try to interrupt.</p><p>\u201cPeter\u2026\u201dYou said, he continued, \u201cPETER!\u201d you said louder grabbing his attention.</p><p>\u201cIf you could stop rambling for a second, despite how adorable it is, i would be able to tell you that i like you too.\u201d You said with a smile.</p><p>Peter looked wide eyed and stared at you with heart eyes.

I couldn\u2019t not take a peek!i\u2019m sorry!\u201d Peter says laughing, you\u2019re laughing too as you begin walking away towards the door again. You look over your shoulder catching Peter checking you out, he quickly becomes flustered and turns away from your gaze.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be back soon cutie!\u201d You call as you exit your room.</p><p>You walk around the tower heading toward your dad\u2019s lab were you knew you could find him, working on another extension of the iron man suit or a new upgrade. You finally arrived at the doorway to the lab, you suck in a deep breath and sigh then continue to type in your specific lab code that granted you access. Of course you had your own code because you loved working on new tech in there all the time, or assisting Dr. Banner. The lab door unlocked, you pushed it open trying to quietly sneak into not scare your dad. But the loud rock music was blaring so remaining quite was unnecessary. You walked up to your dad\u2019s work space, he noticed your movement and turned down the music.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up sugar plum? Jarvis told me that Harold walked out in quite the fit of rage\u201d Tony said bringing back your old childhood nickname. As he looked in your eyes he could see that you were upset about something.</p><p>\u201cHis name is Harry, but that doesn\u2019t even matter anymore because we broke up.\u201d You said.</p><p>\u201cWell good, i didn\u2019t like that guy anyway, total douche.\u201d Tony said with a smile, trying to make you feel better.</p><p>\u201cThen why didn\u2019t you say anything Dad!\u201d You said getting more upset.</p><p>Tony is taken off guard by your sudden outburst toward him, \u201cWell i thought you we\u2019re happy with him and i wouldn\u2019t want to impose on that for you sweetie.\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo dad! I only date these jerks because i want your attention! I know that\u2019s not a good reason, i just want you to take interest in my life! I know you\u2019re busy saving the world and it seems selfish to ask but it would be nice to spend a little time with you!\u201d You said with slight tears brimming in your eyes.</p><p>Tony pulled you into a big hug after you said this, you quickly relaxed into his hold of you.</p><p>\u201cOf course i want to spend time with you (Y/N) i love you so much! And i will admit i get a little carried away my work.\u201dTony said with a smile</p><p>\u201cA little?\u201d You questioned with a laugh.</p><p>Tony laughed before he spoke, \u201cHow about every night we both agree to have a family dinner, and you can spend more time with me in the lab, i mean you\u2019re smarter than me so i need all the help i can get in here!\u201d </p><p>You smiled at his compliments of you before leaning out of the hug to look him in the eye to respond, \u201cI would love that dad!\u201d </p><p>You both hug again before you turn back out and say, \u201cOh i have to go I left Peter by himself in my room, and we need to study for our chem rest next thursday.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh! Speaking of the Spiderling i have a question for you.\u201d Tony says with a smirk on his face.</p><p>\u201cYeah what is it?\u201d You ask feigning innocence </p><p>\u201cWhy was he in your room while you were half naked?\u201d Tony said chuckling but with a seriousness in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cUhhhhh\u2026 long story, but a total accident! I gotta go!!\u201d You said running out of there as fast as possible.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not done with this conversation young lady!\u201d Tony yells back at you as you run away.</p><p>You smile as you run knowing this would be a new begining with both Peter and your dad. You walked back into your room and planted a kiss on Peter\u2019s lips, ready to jump into happily ever after. Now you will have dated six people in your life but needless to say that Peter was the last one you ever needed to date.</p></p>",

Also day of the week underwear\u2026</h2><h2><b>Warnings:</b> A few curse words\u2026also I misspelled underwear multiple times sooooo thats a thing\u2026 also it might suck but Oof who cares?</h2><h2>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-</h2><p>Being Tony Stark\u2019s daughter made you genetically entitled to certain aspects of your personality, like your extreme intelligents along with your wits. You\u2019re filled to the brim with comebacks and sarcastic remarks just as a birthright. But even with all the riches and fame that came with your name you still managed to be incredibly kind and humble. But somehow you had the absolute worst taste in boys (yes boys because they were certainly not men). Somewhere deep in your messed up brain you had convinced yourself that you didn\u2019t deserve nice guys, but even deeper in your brain you knew that it was a way for your dad to notice you more. Yes of course he was proud of you and loved you like no other but he was a busy man, and of course you understood;I mean saving the planet on multiple occasions was time consuming. But, he would always be to deep in his work to take time for you, he missed a lot of special occasions in your life. Like your first day at midtown (he didn\u2019t even say goodbye before you left or wish you good luck). You had always been homeschooled because Tony wanted to ensure you got the best possible education, but he knew you needed to be properly socialized and have friends that were your age and not super soldiers. He would make up for it with expensive gifts, but nothing beat spending time with the old man. </p><p>You had been going to midtown for at least a year now and you were part way through your sophmore year. You fit in very well with the other students, you easily fell in with the popular crowd with your charisma and beauty, and thankfully not for your last name you enrolled under a completely different last name, people just thought it was a coincidence that you looked like the famous (y/n) Stark. But even with rolling with the cool kids you were never rude like some of them were to other students. Like how Flash was rude to Peter Parker, you always stood up for Peter through Flash\u2019s torments. You and Peter we\u2019re good friends, you of course had figured out his secret identity from your father, but before that you were good friends from Academic Decathlon and you were really good study buddies. You weren\u2019t the type to be ashamed of friendships so you made it appoint to express your friendship with your particular crowd so they know not to pick on him when you\u2019re around. With riding with the popular crowd, and having a bad taste in boys, you had a bountiful amount of boys to choose from. </p><p>Since arriving at midtown you\u2019ve dated five guys,including your current boyfriend. First way, Brett the bad boy, he had a motorcycle that your father hated but he never expressed concern because he thought you were happy. Also, Chad the fuck boy who only cared about trying to sleep with you, you being the strong powerful woman you are ended that relationship quickly. Next was Charlie the heartbreaker, sure he seemed nice enough and you really liked him, you even both said you loved each other, but he cheated on you with multiple girls and left you heartbroken, he was the longest relationship you ever had. Peter being the sweetest guy ever came by and was your shoulder to cry on, which was the first time you had ever cried in front of someone ever. After Charlie you didn\u2019t date for awhile at least until halfway through the summer before sophomore year. That\u2019s when you met Ethan the extortionist, he seemed so sweet, but then again they all do, he only wanted to date you because you were a stark and knew the avengers. Now you were a very smart girl but as some might say you were quite stupid with love so you didn\u2019t notice the blatentness of him trying to obtain what you had, but once you finally did you were quick to dump him. Rightnow you were dating Harry, he was extremely attractive but also very possessive and insecure, he did not like the fact that you had any guy friends at all but that never stopped you from continuing to talk to Peter. </p><p>Little did you know that Peter had a massive sized crush on you. He loved the way you talked about anything and everything, especially the things you were passionate about. He loved when you snorted a little when you laughed to hard, or how you were popular but never were ashamed of your friendship with him. Peter also loved when you guys were studying and you would get so frustrated with sitting for so long and force him to have a dance party with you. He loved how happy you\u2019d get when you would ace a test or win a round in Academic Decathlon. Or the way your (y/e/c) eyes would shine with glee all the time. Peter loved everything about you, well except for one thing, your boyfriends. Peter hated them, they were all total douchebags and either only liked you for your money, that is if they knew you were a stark, or they only thought you were some pretty face that they thought they could sleep with or manipulate. But you were so much more than that because yes, you were pretty but you were so smart and funny too and a big geek. He was there during every start and end of the relationships, you cried on his very shoulder after you found out Charlie cheated on you. But Harry was one of the worst boyfriends ever, he was violent and possessive and very much didn\u2019t like Peter. But he was glad that you never backed down to Harry and continued to be his friend.</p><p>At this point you and Harry had been dating for one month so nothing to serious has happened yet except kissing but that seemed like preschool stuff to you at this point. Harry and you were hanging in your room at the tower watching Parks and Rec one of your favorite shows, Harry didn\u2019t really get the jokes but you didn\u2019t care. You had invited peter over to study later but after you assumed Harry would be gone. Peter would be arriving in the next thirty minutes or so you turned to Harry.</p><p>\u201cHey\u2026so I have a family thing in about thirty minutes so you might need to get going in a bit.\u201d you said giving his hand a squeeze.</p><p>\u201cYeah sure babe, i\u2019ll get going here in a second, i just need to go to the bathroom real quick.\u201d Harry said kissing your cheek.</p><p>When Harry had to go to the bathroom \u2018real quick\u2019 it differently did not mean \u2018real quick\u2019 it would definitely take a while. So you took this opportunity to change into more comfortable clothes comparatively to your school clothes. You knew it wouldn\u2019t look like you had a family thing but Harry wasn\u2019t the brightest crayon in the box, so you didn\u2019t really care. You began stripping from your clothes before you went to find your clothes to change into. You looked down to see that you were wearing mismatched underwear, not that you necessarily tried to match, it just these exact pairs were quite strange. First a bra from a long time ago, still cute thought, and secondly, days of the week lacy underwear that was for monday, which was definitely not the day today. You laughed at the haphazard dressing skills you had especially when it was around laundry day. You were fishing around for clothes when a knock came at the door.</p><p>\u201cWho is it?\u201d You asked absent minded.</p><p>\u201cPeter!\u201d Peter yelled back from the other side of the door.</p><p>\u201cCome in!\u201d You said without another thought, of your current state of nakedness.</p><p>\u201cSorry i\u2019m early bu-AH!\u201d Peter said coming in when he noticed you half naked in your room, he quickly cover his eyes and turned around being the gentleman he was but not before looking at your figure, he couldn\u2019t help how his hormones took control. He took notice of how your underwear read \u201cmonday\u201d when it was in fact a Wednesday.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it Pete?\u201d You said worried at his scream, before realizing that you were just standing around half naked.</p><p>Peter was still turned around and you walked up to him, still naked and started apologizing.</p><p>\u201cOh Peter i\u2019m so sorry i totally forgot i was in the middle of changing and i just heard your name so i just let you in without even thinking, oh i\u2019m just so sorry!\u201d You said touching his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cWhat is going on! What is that dip whad doing here babe! Also why the fuck are you half naked!\u201d Harry started yelling</p><p>You turned to him and began explaining what was happening so fast, but about three seconds into your explanations he totally decked peter with a punch, and continued to punch him. You were utterly shocked by his actions, you quickly came to your senses and tried to get him off Peter, yelling at him to stop.</p><p>\u201cHarry! Get off him!!\u201d You screamed in desperation.</p><p>Harry finally stops and gets up from the ground.</p><p>\u201c (Y/N) I told you to stop hanging out with this, this nerd! I can\u2019t believe you let him see you like that, your mine and no one else\u2019s so you better stop seeing him if you want to be with me!\u201d Harry yelled at you.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not your property Harry! You don\u2019t get to dictate my life and tell me who i can and can\u2019t be friend with Harry! Oh incase you haven\u2019t noticed i\u2019m a nerd too! I would never change myself, my interests, or my friends for anyone! So if you can\u2019t except that then we\u2019re over!\u201d You yelled right back with even more fury than him.</p><p>\u201cActually,\u201d you started again, \u201cI think you and your toxic masculinity, insecurities, and possessiveness and leave my life! Don\u2019t let the door hit you on the way out!\u201d You yelled</p><p>Harry left out a huff and left the room and stormed out of the tour.</p><p>\u201cAre you alright Peter, i\u2019m so sorry, I\u2019ll clean you up i\u2019m so, so, so, so sorry!\u201d You say as you move to get a first aid kit.</p><p>You began addressing his wounds and cleaning his face with a wet towel and alcohol, putting your dads favorite hello kitty band-aids on the cut on his cheek. Peter didn\u2019t look at you while you did this, it wasn\u2019t required of him to do this it was just odd behavior for him. Another piece of odd behavior was how he didn\u2019t fight back, he was 100% stronger than Brett being spider-man and all, so he could have easily win the fight.</p><p>\u201cRiddle me this Spider-man, you are incredible strong, i mean you stopped a bus with your bare hands, well i guess gloved in that instance, and yet you didn\u2019t even try to hit Harry back? Why is that? Also why aren\u2019t you looking at me?\u201d You questioned Peter while you placed another band-aid on his face.</p><p>Peter blushed slightly at the mention of his alter ego, along with the fact that you just called him strong, \u201cWell i\u2019m not looking at you because you are still half naked (y/n),\u201d you giggled at the first half of his response and quickly apologized before putting on a crewneck and shorts to later study in. \u201cand I didn\u2019t want to throw a punch because I didn\u2019t want you to think of me like the violent type.\u201d Peter said now looking at you dressed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry Harry was such a jerk, i should have realized sooner and broken up with him, he didn\u2019t like Parks and Rec so that should have been my first sign.\u201d You said laughing a little at your last comment</p><p>\u201cHow does he not like that show it\u2019s the bomb!\u201d Peter said with a smile.</p><p>\u201cI know right!\u201d You smile back basking in the happy moment and laughs that filled the air.</p><p>\u201cBut why do you date these jerks anyway? You\u2019re so smart and funny and amazing and beautiful you deserve someone way better then them.\u201d Peter said</p><p>You smiled at the praise he offered you, \u201cYou really think i\u2019m all of those things Peter,\u201d he nodded intensely sitting up to sit beside you on the ground, \u201cWell i don\u2019t know why i date them, but yeah i guess they have all been jerks, i guess being the daughter of Tony Stark really puts a target on my back for being used, i don\u2019t really know Peter I don\u2019t think nice guys like me\u201d You say sighing. All your reasonings weren\u2019t that valid but you didn\u2019t want to tell Peter the real reason.</p><p>Peter tried to fight his brain into not admitting his feeling for you right in that moment because of how bad the timing was with you just breaking up with Harry, but Peter lost that battle and blurted out, \u201cI like you! And i\u2019m pretty nice\u2026 i think. And not just like you like a friend but, like you like you, god how many times have i said like.\u201d Peter awkwardly stuttered out in the cutest way.</p><p>\u201cAnd I know it\u2019s bad timing in all to tell you that (y/n), and it\u2019s totally ok if you don\u2019t feel the same, oh go i hope i didn\u2019t mess up our friendship\u2026i probably did, oh god (y/n) just forget i said anything. But you\u2019re still amazing and deserve the best.\u201d Peter rambled as you watched him with admiration as he told you how he felt.</p><p>He continued to ramble before you try to interrupt.</p><p>\u201cPeter\u2026\u201dYou said, he continued, \u201cPETER!\u201d you said louder grabbing his attention.</p><p>\u201cIf you could stop rambling for a second, despite how adorable it is, i would be able to tell you that i like you too.\u201d You said with a smile.</p><p>Peter looked wide eyed and stared at you with heart eyes. Then you leaned in a kissed him softly on the lips, he was shocked at first but quickly leaned into it and moved his lips along with yours. It lasted like this for awhile before you both had to pull away to take breath. You both looked into each others eyes lovingly.</p><p>\u201cThe real reason why i date bad guys is to get my Dad\u2019s attention.\u201d You said quickly</p><p>Peter looked at you before speaking, \u201cMaybe you should talk to him about that,\u201d He said and you nodded, \u201cPlus the sooner you get back the sooner we can study, and makeout\u2026but mainly makeout.\u201d Peter said with a sudden burst of confidence. You laughed at his cockyness and threw a pillow at him.</p><p>\u201cOk i\u2019m going to talk to to my dad, but i will be back\u201d You say with wink over your shoulder.</p><p>\u201cHey (Y/N)?\u201d Peter asks</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d You saying turning around in the door frame in the doorframe.</p><p>\u201cYou know it\u2019s Wednesday right?\u201d Peter asks with a slight smirk.</p><p>\u201cUh, yeah why do you think i don\u2019t\u2026\u201d You pause remembering your underwear.</p><p>You run up and hit him in the shoulder hard. He winces in pain.</p><p>\u201cOwww! I can\u2019t help it your butt was screaming at be that it was monday! I couldn\u2019t not take a peek!i\u2019m sorry!\u201d Peter says laughing, you\u2019re laughing too as you begin walking away towards the door again. You look over your shoulder catching Peter checking you out, he quickly becomes flustered and turns away from your gaze.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be back soon cutie!\u201d You call as you exit your room.</p><p>You walk around the tower heading toward your dad\u2019s lab were you knew you could find him, working on another extension of the iron man suit or a new upgrade. You finally arrived at the doorway to the lab, you suck in a deep breath and sigh then continue to type in your specific lab code that granted you access. Of course you had your own code because you loved working on new tech in there all the time, or assisting Dr. Banner. The lab door unlocked, you pushed it open trying to quietly sneak into not scare your dad. But the loud rock music was blaring so remaining quite was unnecessary. You walked up to your dad\u2019s work space, he noticed your movement and turned down the music.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up sugar plum? Jarvis told me that Harold walked out in quite the fit of rage\u201d Tony said bringing back your old childhood nickname. As he looked in your eyes he could see that you were upset about something.</p><p>\u201cHis name is Harry, but that doesn\u2019t even matter anymore because we broke up.\u201d You said.</p><p>\u201cWell good, i didn\u2019t like that guy anyway, total douche.\u201d Tony said with a smile, trying to make you feel better.</p><p>\u201cThen why didn\u2019t you say anything Dad!\u201d You said getting more upset.</p><p>Tony is taken off guard by your sudden outburst toward him, \u201cWell i thought you we\u2019re happy with him and i wouldn\u2019t want to impose on that for you sweetie.\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo dad! I only date these jerks because i want your attention! I know that\u2019s not a good reason, i just want you to take interest in my life! I know you\u2019re busy saving the world and it seems selfish to ask but it would be nice to spend a little time with you!\u201d You said with slight tears brimming in your eyes.</p><p>Tony pulled you into a big hug after you said this, you quickly relaxed into his hold of you.</p><p>\u201cOf course i want to spend time with you (Y/N) i love you so much! And i will admit i get a little carried away my work.\u201dTony said with a smile</p><p>\u201cA little?\u201d You questioned with a laugh.</p><p>Tony laughed before he spoke, \u201cHow about every night we both agree to have a family dinner, and you can spend more time with me in the lab, i mean you\u2019re smarter than me so i need all the help i can get in here!\u201d </p><p>You smiled at his compliments of you before leaning out of the hug to look him in the eye to respond, \u201cI would love that dad!\u201d </p><p>You both hug again before you turn back out and say, \u201cOh i have to go I left Peter by himself in my room, and we need to study for our chem rest next thursday.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh! Speaking of the Spiderling i have a question for you.\u201d Tony says with a smirk on his face.</p><p>\u201cYeah what is it?\u201d You ask feigning innocence </p><p>\u201cWhy was he in your room while you were half naked?\u201d Tony said chuckling but with a seriousness in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cUhhhhh\u2026 long story, but a total accident! I gotta go!!\u201d You said running out of there as fast as possible.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not done with this conversation young lady!\u201d Tony yells back at you as you run away.</p><p>You smile as you run knowing this would be a new begining with both Peter and your dad. You walked back into your room and planted a kiss on Peter\u2019s lips, ready to jump into happily ever after. Now you will have dated six people in your life but needless to say that Peter was the last one you ever needed to date.</p></p>",

Also day of the week underwear&hellip;</h2><h2><b>Warnings:</b> A few curse words&hellip;also I misspelled underwear multiple times sooooo thats a thing&hellip; also it might suck but Oof who cares?</h2><h2>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-</h2><p>Being Tony Stark&rsquo;s daughter made you genetically entitled to certain aspects of your personality, like your extreme intelligents along with your wits. You&rsquo;re filled to the brim with comebacks and sarcastic remarks just as a birthright. But even with all the riches and fame that came with your name you still managed to be incredibly kind and humble. But somehow you had the absolute worst taste in boys (yes boys because they were certainly not men). Somewhere deep in your messed up brain you had convinced yourself that you didn&rsquo;t deserve nice guys, but even deeper in your brain you knew that it was a way for your dad to notice you more. Yes of course he was proud of you and loved you like no other but he was a busy man, and of course you understood;I mean saving the planet on multiple occasions was time consuming. But, he would always be to deep in his work to take time for you, he missed a lot of special occasions in your life. Like your first day at midtown (he didn&rsquo;t even say goodbye before you left or wish you good luck). You had always been homeschooled because Tony wanted to ensure you got the best possible education, but he knew you needed to be properly socialized and have friends that were your age and not super soldiers. He would make up for it with expensive gifts, but nothing beat spending time with the old man. </p><p>You had been going to midtown for at least a year now and you were part way through your sophmore year. You fit in very well with the other students, you easily fell in with the popular crowd with your charisma and beauty, and thankfully not for your last name you enrolled under a completely different last name, people just thought it was a coincidence that you looked like the famous (y/n) Stark. But even with rolling with the cool kids you were never rude like some of them were to other students. Like how Flash was rude to Peter Parker, you always stood up for Peter through Flash&rsquo;s torments. You and Peter we&rsquo;re good friends, you of course had figured out his secret identity from your father, but before that you were good friends from Academic Decathlon and you were really good study buddies. You weren&rsquo;t the type to be ashamed of friendships so you made it appoint to express your friendship with your particular crowd so they know not to pick on him when you&rsquo;re around. With riding with the popular crowd, and having a bad taste in boys, you had a bountiful amount of boys to choose from. </p><p>Since arriving at midtown you&rsquo;ve dated five guys,including your current boyfriend. First way, Brett the bad boy, he had a motorcycle that your father hated but he never expressed concern because he thought you were happy. Also, Chad the fuck boy who only cared about trying to sleep with you, you being the strong powerful woman you are ended that relationship quickly. Next was Charlie the heartbreaker, sure he seemed nice enough and you really liked him, you even both said you loved each other, but he cheated on you with multiple girls and left you heartbroken, he was the longest relationship you ever had. Peter being the sweetest guy ever came by and was your shoulder to cry on, which was the first time you had ever cried in front of someone ever. After Charlie you didn&rsquo;t date for awhile at least until halfway through the summer before sophomore year. That&rsquo;s when you met Ethan the extortionist, he seemed so sweet, but then again they all do, he only wanted to date you because you were a stark and knew the avengers. Now you were a very smart girl but as some might say you were quite stupid with love so you didn&rsquo;t notice the blatentness of him trying to obtain what you had, but once you finally did you were quick to dump him. Rightnow you were dating Harry, he was extremely attractive but also very possessive and insecure, he did not like the fact that you had any guy friends at all but that never stopped you from continuing to talk to Peter. </p><p>Little did you know that Peter had a massive sized crush on you. He loved the way you talked about anything and everything, especially the things you were passionate about. He loved when you snorted a little when you laughed to hard, or how you were popular but never were ashamed of your friendship with him. Peter also loved when you guys were studying and you would get so frustrated with sitting for so long and force him to have a dance party with you. He loved how happy you&rsquo;d get when you would ace a test or win a round in Academic Decathlon. Or the way your (y/e/c) eyes would shine with glee all the time. Peter loved everything about you, well except for one thing, your boyfriends. Peter hated them, they were all total douchebags and either only liked you for your money, that is if they knew you were a stark, or they only thought you were some pretty face that they thought they could sleep with or manipulate. But you were so much more than that because yes, you were pretty but you were so smart and funny too and a big geek. He was there during every start and end of the relationships, you cried on his very shoulder after you found out Charlie cheated on you. But Harry was one of the worst boyfriends ever, he was violent and possessive and very much didn&rsquo;t like Peter. But he was glad that you never backed down to Harry and continued to be his friend.</p><p>At this point you and Harry had been dating for one month so nothing to serious has happened yet except kissing but that seemed like preschool stuff to you at this point. Harry and you were hanging in your room at the tower watching Parks and Rec one of your favorite shows, Harry didn&rsquo;t really get the jokes but you didn&rsquo;t care. You had invited peter over to study later but after you assumed Harry would be gone. Peter would be arriving in the next thirty minutes or so you turned to Harry.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey&hellip;so I have a family thing in about thirty minutes so you might need to get going in a bit.&rdquo; you said giving his hand a squeeze.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah sure babe, i&rsquo;ll get going here in a second, i just need to go to the bathroom real quick.&rdquo; Harry said kissing your cheek.</p><p>When Harry had to go to the bathroom &lsquo;real quick&rsquo; it differently did not mean &lsquo;real quick&rsquo; it would definitely take a while. So you took this opportunity to change into more comfortable clothes comparatively to your school clothes. You knew it wouldn&rsquo;t look like you had a family thing but Harry wasn&rsquo;t the brightest crayon in the box, so you didn&rsquo;t really care. You began stripping from your clothes before you went to find your clothes to change into. You looked down to see that you were wearing mismatched underwear, not that you necessarily tried to match, it just these exact pairs were quite strange. First a bra from a long time ago, still cute thought, and secondly, days of the week lacy underwear that was for monday, which was definitely not the day today. You laughed at the haphazard dressing skills you had especially when it was around laundry day. You were fishing around for clothes when a knock came at the door.</p><p>&ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo; You asked absent minded.</p><p>&ldquo;Peter!&rdquo; Peter yelled back from the other side of the door.</p><p>&ldquo;Come in!&rdquo; You said without another thought, of your current state of nakedness.</p><p>&ldquo;Sorry i&rsquo;m early bu-AH!&rdquo; Peter said coming in when he noticed you half naked in your room, he quickly cover his eyes and turned around being the gentleman he was but not before looking at your figure, he couldn&rsquo;t help how his hormones took control. He took notice of how your underwear read &ldquo;monday&rdquo; when it was in fact a Wednesday.</p><p>&ldquo;What is it Pete?&rdquo; You said worried at his scream, before realizing that you were just standing around half naked.</p><p>Peter was still turned around and you walked up to him, still naked and started apologizing.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh Peter i&rsquo;m so sorry i totally forgot i was in the middle of changing and i just heard your name so i just let you in without even thinking, oh i&rsquo;m just so sorry!&rdquo; You said touching his shoulder.</p><p>&ldquo;What is going on! What is that dip whad doing here babe! Also why the fuck are you half naked!&rdquo; Harry started yelling</p><p>You turned to him and began explaining what was happening so fast, but about three seconds into your explanations he totally decked peter with a punch, and continued to punch him. You were utterly shocked by his actions, you quickly came to your senses and tried to get him off Peter, yelling at him to stop.</p><p>&ldquo;Harry! Get off him!!&rdquo; You screamed in desperation.</p><p>Harry finally stops and gets up from the ground.</p><p>&ldquo; (Y/N) I told you to stop hanging out with this, this nerd! I can&rsquo;t believe you let him see you like that, your mine and no one else&rsquo;s so you better stop seeing him if you want to be with me!&rdquo; Harry yelled at you.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not your property Harry! You don&rsquo;t get to dictate my life and tell me who i can and can&rsquo;t be friend with Harry! Oh incase you haven&rsquo;t noticed i&rsquo;m a nerd too! I would never change myself, my interests, or my friends for anyone! So if you can&rsquo;t except that then we&rsquo;re over!&rdquo; You yelled right back with even more fury than him.</p><p>&ldquo;Actually,&rdquo; you started again, &ldquo;I think you and your toxic masculinity, insecurities, and possessiveness and leave my life! Don&rsquo;t let the door hit you on the way out!&rdquo; You yelled</p><p>Harry left out a huff and left the room and stormed out of the tour.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you alright Peter, i&rsquo;m so sorry, I&rsquo;ll clean you up i&rsquo;m so, so, so, so sorry!&rdquo; You say as you move to get a first aid kit.</p><p>You began addressing his wounds and cleaning his face with a wet towel and alcohol, putting your dads favorite hello kitty band-aids on the cut on his cheek. Peter didn&rsquo;t look at you while you did this, it wasn&rsquo;t required of him to do this it was just odd behavior for him. Another piece of odd behavior was how he didn&rsquo;t fight back, he was 100% stronger than Brett being spider-man and all, so he could have easily win the fight.</p><p>&ldquo;Riddle me this Spider-man, you are incredible strong, i mean you stopped a bus with your bare hands, well i guess gloved in that instance, and yet you didn&rsquo;t even try to hit Harry back? Why is that? Also why aren&rsquo;t you looking at me?&rdquo; You questioned Peter while you placed another band-aid on his face.</p><p>Peter blushed slightly at the mention of his alter ego, along with the fact that you just called him strong, &ldquo;Well i&rsquo;m not looking at you because you are still half naked (y/n),&rdquo; you giggled at the first half of his response and quickly apologized before putting on a crewneck and shorts to later study in. &ldquo;and I didn&rsquo;t want to throw a punch because I didn&rsquo;t want you to think of me like the violent type.&rdquo; Peter said now looking at you dressed.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry Harry was such a jerk, i should have realized sooner and broken up with him, he didn&rsquo;t like Parks and Rec so that should have been my first sign.&rdquo; You said laughing a little at your last comment</p><p>&ldquo;How does he not like that show it&rsquo;s the bomb!&rdquo; Peter said with a smile.</p><p>&ldquo;I know right!&rdquo; You smile back basking in the happy moment and laughs that filled the air.</p><p>&ldquo;But why do you date these jerks anyway? You&rsquo;re so smart and funny and amazing and beautiful you deserve someone way better then them.&rdquo; Peter said</p><p>You smiled at the praise he offered you, &ldquo;You really think i&rsquo;m all of those things Peter,&rdquo; he nodded intensely sitting up to sit beside you on the ground, &ldquo;Well i don&rsquo;t know why i date them, but yeah i guess they have all been jerks, i guess being the daughter of Tony Stark really puts a target on my back for being used, i don&rsquo;t really know Peter I don&rsquo;t think nice guys like me&rdquo; You say sighing. All your reasonings weren&rsquo;t that valid but you didn&rsquo;t want to tell Peter the real reason.</p><p>Peter tried to fight his brain into not admitting his feeling for you right in that moment because of how bad the timing was with you just breaking up with Harry, but Peter lost that battle and blurted out, &ldquo;I like you! And i&rsquo;m pretty nice&hellip; i think. And not just like you like a friend but, like you like you, god how many times have i said like.&rdquo; Peter awkwardly stuttered out in the cutest way.</p><p>&ldquo;And I know it&rsquo;s bad timing in all to tell you that (y/n), and it&rsquo;s totally ok if you don&rsquo;t feel the same, oh go i hope i didn&rsquo;t mess up our friendship&hellip;i probably did, oh god (y/n) just forget i said anything. But you&rsquo;re still amazing and deserve the best.&rdquo; Peter rambled as you watched him with admiration as he told you how he felt.</p><p>He continued to ramble before you try to interrupt.</p><p>&ldquo;Peter&hellip;&rdquo;You said, he continued, &ldquo;PETER!&rdquo; you said louder grabbing his attention.</p><p>&ldquo;If you could stop rambling for a second, despite how adorable it is, i would be able to tell you that i like you too.&rdquo; You said with a smile.</p><p>Peter looked wide eyed and stared at you with heart eyes. Then you leaned in a kissed him softly on the lips, he was shocked at first but quickly leaned into it and moved his lips along with yours. It lasted like this for awhile before you both had to pull away to take breath. You both looked into each others eyes lovingly.</p><p>&ldquo;The real reason why i date bad guys is to get my Dad&rsquo;s attention.&rdquo; You said quickly</p><p>Peter looked at you before speaking, &ldquo;Maybe you should talk to him about that,&rdquo; He said and you nodded, &ldquo;Plus the sooner you get back the sooner we can study, and makeout&hellip;but mainly makeout.&rdquo; Peter said with a sudden burst of confidence. You laughed at his cockyness and threw a pillow at him.</p><p>&ldquo;Ok i&rsquo;m going to talk to to my dad, but i will be back&rdquo; You say with wink over your shoulder.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey (Y/N)?&rdquo; Peter asks</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah?&rdquo; You saying turning around in the door frame in the doorframe.</p><p>&ldquo;You know it&rsquo;s Wednesday right?&rdquo; Peter asks with a slight smirk.</p><p>&ldquo;Uh, yeah why do you think i don&rsquo;t&hellip;&rdquo; You pause remembering your underwear.</p><p>You run up and hit him in the shoulder hard. He winces in pain.</p><p>&ldquo;Owww! I can&rsquo;t help it your butt was screaming at be that it was monday! I couldn&rsquo;t not take a peek!i&rsquo;m sorry!&rdquo; Peter says laughing, you&rsquo;re laughing too as you begin walking away towards the door again. You look over your shoulder catching Peter checking you out, he quickly becomes flustered and turns away from your gaze.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be back soon cutie!&rdquo; You call as you exit your room.</p><p>You walk around the tower heading toward your dad&rsquo;s lab were you knew you could find him, working on another extension of the iron man suit or a new upgrade. You finally arrived at the doorway to the lab, you suck in a deep breath and sigh then continue to type in your specific lab code that granted you access. Of course you had your own code because you loved working on new tech in there all the time, or assisting Dr. Banner. The lab door unlocked, you pushed it open trying to quietly sneak into not scare your dad. But the loud rock music was blaring so remaining quite was unnecessary. You walked up to your dad&rsquo;s work space, he noticed your movement and turned down the music.</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up sugar plum? Jarvis told me that Harold walked out in quite the fit of rage&rdquo; Tony said bringing back your old childhood nickname. As he looked in your eyes he could see that you were upset about something.</p><p>&ldquo;His name is Harry, but that doesn&rsquo;t even matter anymore because we broke up.&rdquo; You said.</p><p>&ldquo;Well good, i didn&rsquo;t like that guy anyway, total douche.&rdquo; Tony said with a smile, trying to make you feel better.</p><p>&ldquo;Then why didn&rsquo;t you say anything Dad!&rdquo; You said getting more upset.</p><p>Tony is taken off guard by your sudden outburst toward him, &ldquo;Well i thought you we&rsquo;re happy with him and i wouldn&rsquo;t want to impose on that for you sweetie.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;No dad! I only date these jerks because i want your attention! I know that&rsquo;s not a good reason, i just want you to take interest in my life! I know you&rsquo;re busy saving the world and it seems selfish to ask but it would be nice to spend a little time with you!&rdquo; You said with slight tears brimming in your eyes.</p><p>Tony pulled you into a big hug after you said this, you quickly relaxed into his hold of you.</p><p>&ldquo;Of course i want to spend time with you (Y/N) i love you so much! And i will admit i get a little carried away my work.&rdquo;Tony said with a smile</p><p>&ldquo;A little?&rdquo; You questioned with a laugh.</p><p>Tony laughed before he spoke, &ldquo;How about every night we both agree to have a family dinner, and you can spend more time with me in the lab, i mean you&rsquo;re smarter than me so i need all the help i can get in here!&rdquo; </p><p>You smiled at his compliments of you before leaning out of the hug to look him in the eye to respond, &ldquo;I would love that dad!&rdquo; </p><p>You both hug again before you turn back out and say, &ldquo;Oh i have to go I left Peter by himself in my room, and we need to study for our chem rest next thursday.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Oh! Speaking of the Spiderling i have a question for you.&rdquo; Tony says with a smirk on his face.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah what is it?&rdquo; You ask feigning innocence </p><p>&ldquo;Why was he in your room while you were half naked?&rdquo; Tony said chuckling but with a seriousness in his eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;Uhhhhh&hellip; long story, but a total accident! I gotta go!!&rdquo; You said running out of there as fast as possible.</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not done with this conversation young lady!&rdquo; Tony yells back at you as you run away.</p><p>You smile as you run knowing this would be a new begining with both Peter and your dad. You walked back into your room and planted a kiss on Peter&rsquo;s lips, ready to jump into happily ever after. Now you will have dated six people in your life but needless to say that Peter was the last one you ever needed to date.</p></p>",

Lost in thought, he takes no interest in his surroundings until his feet stop at one particular set of stairs. They aren&rsquo;t imposing, being only two steps between door and sidewalk. Three if he counts the top one. The area between the stair and door isn&rsquo;t imposing either, a few steps and he&rsquo;s there. He studied the door, noting how ordinary and typical it is. There&rsquo;s two of them, to be precise, and when has he not been precise?</p><p>He considers knocking, though he doesn&rsquo;t want to be a bother to anyone. Which is why he went for a walk in the first place. A note had been left behind, on his work bench, letting anyone who cared to read it that he is going to the city for a few days off. It&rsquo;s not like he didn&rsquo;t deserve it. By his calculations, he could go on vacation for the rest of his life and not use up all his time, if he worked a regular job. Which he didn&rsquo;t.</p><p>It baffles him why he&rsquo;s here, at this door, right now. At least, that&rsquo;s what he tells himself. Like he doesn&rsquo;t know why he came this way. Nothing else makes sense. That, above all else, is what brings him here. He doesn&rsquo;t know where else he could go. Nobody he knows understands the dilemma he is facing. So he stands here, at this door, wondering if this is also a mistake.</p><p>The door opens, on its own, revealing the man he&rsquo;s come to see. To talk to, hopefully. Dr Strange stands there, a faint smile softening the edges of his face.</p><p>\u201cNamaste, Tony Stark. I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;ve come by for a visit.\u201d</p><!-- more --><p>\u201cSo you knew I was coming for a visit?\u201d Tony can&rsquo;t help but sound skeptical. </p><p>The faint smile bursts into its full radiance, lightening Strange\u2019s countenance immensely. \u201cNot exactly, but the probabilities were highest for this morning. Please,\u201d he steps back from the doorway, motioning inward, \u201ccome inside.\u201d</p><p>Shedding his reluctance, Tony steps through the door, hands in his pockets. He glances around, noting that Strange is wearing that blue robe that seems to be his outfit of choice when working his magic. The foyer had been repaired, something Tony had seen to, despite the doctor&rsquo;s protest. No one else was here, judging by the silence of the house. Strange heads toward the back of the house, bypassing the stairs.</p><p>\u201cWhat brings you here today, Tony? May I call you Tony?\u201d Strange turns his head as they walk, tossing the questions over his shoulder.</p><p>Tony shrugs. \u201cI prefer that, actually. Especially when I&rsquo;m being friendly.\u201d</p><p>He stops at the end of the hallway, hands still in his pockets. Head tipping sideways, he stares out over the display floor, not seeing any of the items contained there, his mind searching for an answer to the first question. After several seconds of not finding one, his gaze lowers to the floor, focusing on his shoes. A pair of boots come into view, followed by a hand on his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cIt&rsquo;s okay to say you don&rsquo;t know.\u201d Strange&rsquo;s voice soothes him, settling over him, blanketing him unexpectedly in comfort. He releases his grip on Tony&rsquo;s shoulder and turns back the way he&rsquo;d been heading. \u201cPerhaps we can figure something out while you&rsquo;re here.\u201d</p><p>Following slowly behind, Tony starts humming the tune that pops into his head. After the opening bars and first two verses, he begins singing, softly, barely breathing the words of the chorus. </p><p><i>Tell me, tell me where I&rsquo;m going<br/>I don&rsquo;t know where I&rsquo;ve been<br/>Tell me, tell me, won&rsquo;t you tell me<br/>And then tell me again<br/>My heart is breaking, my body&rsquo;s aching<br/>And I don&rsquo;t know where to go<br/>Tell me, tell me, won&rsquo;t you tell me<br/>I&rsquo;ve just got to know</i></p><p>\u201c<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSuQbF9suqA\">Crystal Ball</a>. Styx. 1976 from the album of the same name. Released again on the Caught in the Act album, 1984. And again in 1997 on the Return to Paradise album. One of Tommy Shaw\u2019s best songs, ever. In my opinion.\u201d Strange returns to Tony\u2019s side with a mug of something steaming in each hand and gives one to Tony with a smug little grin. Tony recognizes that grin. It\u2019s the same as the one that he gets when he is showing off. It\u2019s been a long time since he\u2019s had a reason to use it.</p><p>\u201cWow, you\u2019re kidding me. Now that\u2019s impressive.\u201d Tony hasn\u2019t had anyone show off for him in a long time, either. He takes the drink, noting that the mug is cool, even while the liquid steams within it. Magic, he supposes, taking a drink as he thinks of a couple different ways that could be made to happen with technology. Not that he\u2019d ever have a chance to make a device to do that. His inner scoffing gets interrupted by the taste of whatever is in this cup. </p><p>\u201cThis is amazing! What is it?\u201d He turns to find Strange, the doctor having stepped out of view again, leaving Tony standing in the middle of an area whose boundaries are defined by a couple of leather couches and a high wooden desk covered in books and papers that appear to be antiques, or at least old and handmade. He wonders if he should call the man Dr Strange, though that feels so formal at this point. </p><p>\u201cCall me Stephen. I think we are on good enough terms for that, don\u2019t you, Tony?\u201d Stephen has walked up behind him and is staring at his back. Or he was, as Tony spins around to find him standing there, chin in hand, elbow on wrist, concerned look on his face, eyes focused where Tony\u2019s spine had been a few seconds ago. </p><p>\u201cAnd, it\u2019s just tea, with a little honey. A special blend I put together to help with anxiety and nerves. Don\u2019t worry. I drink it all the time.\u201d He waves his hand, smiling as Tony\u2019s mug fills back up with the steaming liquid. \u201cWhen was the last time you visited a doctor about your insomnia and anxiety?\u201d</p><p>Tony nearly spit his tea over the front of Stephen\u2019s blue robe. As it is, he chokes a couple of times on the drops of liquid that have gotten caught in his windpipe, sucking in air and coughing it out as Stephen pats his back. One last time, he coughs and then his lungs are clear, though his head is spinning now, from the influx of oxygen and from the concern in Stephen\u2019s voice. Like that smug little grin, Tony isn\u2019t sure when the last time he\u2019d had that question asked of him. He forgets that Strange, no-no, Stephen, is actually a doctor. The magic, among other things, had distracted him from that fact.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t been vetted by a medical doctor for more than scratches and bruises in, oh,\u201d pausing to think back, Tony is interrupted by Stephen shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cThat is entirely too long and unacceptable. May I take a look?\u201d He holds out his hands for Tony to give his shirt up, only to see the confused look on the genius\u2019s face. \u201cYour shirt please, Tony. I\u2019d like to -\u201d</p><p>\u201cExamine me? Play doctor with me?\u201d Tony hands over his mug and allows a mischievous grin to play across his lips as he starts to unzip his running jacket a little at a time, shaking his hips to each side as he starts to make snare drum sounds. \u00a0To his surprise, Stephen sets the mug on the nearby desk and stands there, hands on hips, tossing his head back in laughter.</p><p>\u201cOh this ought to be interesting. Maybe I should ask you to take it all off, if you\u2019re going to give me a show?\u201d His grin is full, accompanied by raised eyebrows as he watches Tony get to the bottom of the zipper and pull open one side of the jacket, showing his still-clothed shoulder. </p><p>Tony gives his shoulder a little wiggle, blowing a kiss toward Stephen. \u201cYou okay with this, doc?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell you could do it a little faster, but if this gets your shirt off, then I\u2019m fine. I\u2019ll try to stay professional for the exam, then we can talk about personal preferences later. Say, over dinner?\u201d </p><p>The one eyebrow that remains raised tells Tony that the man really is seriously asking him out, right now, even as Tony is undressing for him. Heat flashes through him, head to loins, leaving him flustered and caught off-guard. He stops dancing and pulls the jacket off, giving the doctor a sassy grin, though his eyelids flutter down as he finds himself unable to look Stephen in the eye at this moment. The jacket lands on the couch with his toss, followed by the shirt. Tony resists the urge to flex, though he does tighten his stomach muscles a little.</p><p>A low whistle comes from Stephen\u2019s pursed lips as he views Tony\u2019s upper body, from his sculpted abs up to the cut pecs and deltoids. Every part of the man\u2019s torso is defined and toned. Stephen had figured that managing the flexibility and movement of the Iron Man suit would keep Tony in shape, but it definitely looks like the man has done more on his own beyond the strictly necessary maintenance. Besides showing appreciation, he really likes how the red of Tony\u2019s cheeks looks against his tan skin and the sultry smile that is being held back but still curves those lips. </p><p>Raising his gaze, Tony finds himself being appraised very frankly, both professionally and with personal interest. He\u2019s certain this is what a specimen on display must feel like, though with Stephen, he has a brief moment of confusion, experiencing both attraction and shyness toward his examiner. </p><p>His attraction to the man has been in him since their first meeting, standing in the foyer of this house, discussing Infinity Stones and flavors of ice cream. The fact that Stephen had known the flavor Ben and Jerry\u2019s had named after him, but then gave it a less than stellar review in only a few words, had lit the fire. Now, after everything they\u2019d been through, Tony almost can\u2019t believe that the attraction is reciprocated. He\u2019d been sure they\u2019d become friends, albeit reluctantly on Stephen\u2019s part, but finding out that it\u2019s more than just intellectual is exciting, and daunting. This sudden rush of nerves can only be from Tony\u2019s desire to not mess things up. </p><p>\u201cMay I?\u201d Stephen\u2019s request interrupts Tony\u2019s inner monologue as the doctor steps closer. </p><p>Tony notices the red cloak has removed itself from Stephen\u2019s shoulders and taken up a position behind the couch, hanging there like a watchful butler. An unexpected memory of Jarvis hits him out of the blue, bringing a sniff to him against the briefest whiff of nostalgia.</p><p>\u201cSure thing, Doc. Just tell me what you want me to do.\u201d Tony replies, catching a brief smirk as Stephen walks around him and again takes up a position behind him. </p><p>\u201cFor right now,\u201d Stephen\u2019s words are slow, drawn out as though he is concentrating on something other than speaking, \u201cI just need you to remain still and relaxed. You can talk, if you like.\u201d</p><p>Hooking his thumb in the waistband of his pants, Tony realizes he doesn\u2019t feel the urge to talk, to fill the empty spaces, like he usually does. He\u2019s got a weird itch between his shoulder blades, though Stephen hasn\u2019t lain a finger on him yet, to his dismay. He wants to have those hands on him, touching him. His imagination has been telling him how gentle and unobtrusive that touch would be, but for now, he has to settle for eyes only. Words do come to mind after a couple of minutes of silence. </p><p>\u201cWell, Doc, what\u2019s the prognosis? Is it fatal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLife is always fatal, if not deadly, Tony.\u201d Low and rumbly, Stephen\u2019s words are tinged with a bit of laughter that brings an answering smile to Tony\u2019s lips. He\u2019s about to respond when Stephen continues. \u201cYou are in remarkably good condition, physically. Your aura is a mess, and your chakra points need cleansed, which I can do for you, no problem. The worst is your spinal column. With these compression fractures and pinched nerves, it\u2019s a wonder you\u2019re not in more pain than you are. Your endorphin level is through the roof, and your serotonin production is out of whack, as are your lymphatic and endocrine systems. Explains the insomnia and a lot of the anxiety.\u201d</p><p>Thrown off by Stephen\u2019s reference to chakra points and endocrine systems, along with everything else he\u2019d said, all jumbled together and delivered in the tone he\u2019d expect to hear from an auto mechanic, Tony remains silent. He resists the urge to watch as Stephen walks around him, mumbling words in languages he doesn\u2019t understand. When Stephen comes to a stop behind him, Tony takes a deep breath, expecting to be poked and prodded like any other doctor would. Instead, hearing a low hum start up, he tries to turn his head to see what is happening.</p><p>\u201cTssss, hold still please.\u201d Stephen\u2019s near-whisper of a request stops his head mid-turn. </p><p>\u201cCan I straighten my head back?\u201d Tony murmurs the question from the side of his mouth, his neck muscles protesting the odd angle.</p><p>\u201cYes, please. This will just take a minute once everything is set.\u201d Concentration is evident in Stephen\u2019s tone, as though he is holding something in place until Tony is ready.</p><p>Tony moves his head back to the front cautiously, not sure what Stephen is doing, but certain it is complicated, going by the doctor\u2019s tone. The hum continues, reminding him of high-voltage transformers, or the giant arc-reactor he used to have on display so many years ago. His back feels twitchy and he can sense actual energy, like heat but not hot, coming off of whatever Stephen had started back there. Once his head is back in position, he hears more of the snap and hum behind him. </p><p>\u201cAlright, everything is set up and ready. This is going to be strange and maybe a bit like touching an electric fence, but you\u2019ll start to feel better once it\u2019s done.\u201d Behind him, Stephen manages to sound confident and cautious, the susurration of cloth underlying the murmur of his voice. \u201cMay I proceed?\u201d</p><p>Tony chuckles to himself a bit at Stephen describing something as strange. Increasing in pitch, the hum of whatever is behind him gives him pause, causing him to evaluate how much he trusts the man that is creating this buzz of energy. It\u2019s as though his bones are beginning to vibrate at the same frequency of the hum, charging his senses and fueling his anticipation. An odd desire ignites in his chest, even as the arc reactor there starts to hum as well. Resisting the urge to bounce or move in anyway, Tony gives a quick, sharp nod.</p><p>A sharply exhaled vocalization comes from Stephen, similar to that used by martial artists when performing strength moves. Energy hits Tony in the back, a framework connecting points of himself as though wires had been strung between them. Shoulder to chest, chest to loins, knees to feet and back up through his spine to his head. At his forehead, light blossoms, turning the room an unknown degree, like it had been spun on an axis and he is trying to view it as it spins. His hands float up, palms filling with light as well, reminding him of repulsors, though he has no armor, no suit around him. </p><p>He glances down as his feet begin to feel the same, laughing as he sees the floor falling slowly away from his body. The hum encompasses him now, buzzing throughout his entirety, filling him with light, lifting him from the floor. A thought that he wants to see Stephen\u2019s face at this sight is conceived and acted upon without a break between, his physical being turning around to face the man behind him. For a moment, the room spins beyond what he can see with his eyes, yet he doesn\u2019t lose track of what he is seeing. It bounds back, rebounding back and forth until he thinks that it needs to stop, so it does. He knows he is grinning as he floats there, holding the framework in his thoughts, sure that it wasn\u2019t supposed to last this long but unwilling to let it go, to let this feeling go. </p><p>The look of awe on Stephen\u2019s face is wonderous, filling Tony\u2019s chest with an emotion he hasn\u2019t been privy to very often, one that he is reluctant to admit he can feel. Instead, he winks and grins as Stephen holds out his hands, beckoning him to let go of the energy and return to physical existence. Tony doesn\u2019t want to, but years of self-monitoring and biofeedback tells him his heart is racing. Thinking of it allows him to hear his pulse, the rush of blood surging through his veins, the actual beat of his heart, damaged though it is, strong and steady. </p><p>Threads of gold and white in that area of his body attract his attention and he sees how some of them are tangled and knotted, causing slight irregularities in the rhythm of the heart muscle. He starts to move closer but is interrupted by Stephen\u2019s voice calling to him, asking him to return, reminding him that he should be focusing on the whole, not individual pieces. Withdrawing his focus, Tony returns to looking at Stephen looking at him. His grin returning, his entire being relaxed and energized, he lets go of the energy framework and thumps gently back to the floor. </p><p>Stephen\u2019s mouth hangs open for a couple of seconds before he closes it with a click, swallowing hard to clear his throat so he can speak. He has performed this cleansing several times since he learned the incantations for it, but in the time that has passed since it was first shown to him, he has never seen anyone not already an adept take control of the healing energy in this manner. He\u2019s also never felt this way when someone has looked at him before, whether or not they were encased in illuminating energy. The experience has rendered him speechless. </p><p>From the first time he\u2019d met Tony, in his foyer after convincing him to step through the portal in the park that fateful day, Stephen could feel the energy bleeding from him. It charged the air between them, starting with snippets and jabs at each other, changing to something better the moment Tony had stepped out in front of the four of them to face down Thanos\u2019s minion without hesitation. The smile he\u2019d received after winking at Tony had sent his heart flipping out of control. It had the heady feeling of jumping from the top of a cliff, sure you can fly but weightless and freefalling until the moment your method of descent control kicks in. </p><p>Now, doing what he can to help Tony return to the health and strength he hasn\u2019t enjoyed in many years, Stephen finds that yet again, he is surprised and left in freefall, trying to catch up, a sensation that only this man in front of him has given him. Holding out his hands, he holds back the emotions that are running rampant through him, not sure that he is ready to share them or that Tony feels the same way. So much has happened and now that things are getting back to normal, he hesitates to impose. After all, Tony is still engaged to someone else. </p><p>\u201cAre you alright? That was quite the feat.\u201d Stephen somehow manages to keep his voice smooth and even, despite how unsteady he is inside. </p><p>\u201cI feel fabulous!\u201d Tony gives Stephen\u2019s hands a light squeeze, glad to have something to hold onto. Bouncing in place now that he no longer has to hold still, he grins yet again at Stephen, overjoyed with everything right now. When Stephen grins back and winks at him, he almost jumps to hug him, then holds back, not sure how that would be received. </p><p>Staring into each other\u2019s eyes, they lose track of time, seconds passing by without notice, until they do and step back so quickly it\u2019s nearly a jump, each regretting the breaking of the moment\u2019s lucid silence, yet afraid to be caught in the act. Fear is the killer of such moments, one or the other worrying, thinking too much, concerned over the reaction of people that aren\u2019t even around to judge. The shuffling of feet and clearing of throats cover the unexpected burst of affections brought out by the connection they have established between them. </p><p>Tony, used to being caught out in the open, to hiding his true self behind meaningless banter, is the first to speak. \u201cSo, how many bedrooms does this place have? Care to give me a tour? I\u2019ve been dying to see the rest of the place\u2026\u201d</p><p>His words trail off, the usual meaningless banter not so meaningless now, not after what has happened so very recently. Too recent to not have more weight than intended. </p><p>Stephen wants to make light of that phrase, joke about coming back just for that reason, but he is still too stunned from what Tony did with the healing spell for the words to fall so easily from his mouth. Mostly it\u2019s the fear that something inappropriate to the moment will fall out instead. He settles for a wry smile, one side of his face twisting upward while the other half holds back the urge to step closer, get closer, up into personal space that hasn\u2019t been opened for him yet. The signs are there, it wouldn\u2019t be unwelcome, but there\u2019s a difference between not unwelcome and invited, as much as there is between no reason not to and every reason to wait. </p><p>Seeing that wry smile sit on Stephen\u2019s face, Tony gets the implication of words held back and knows, implicitly, deep down in those parts of him that he thought had drowned long ago, that this is his show. His call, his move, his dance to lead. The tension now is so thick he can feel it, invisible but burning as hot as anything he\u2019s ever experienced stretching taut between them. Power of this magnitude is heady, light on oxygen, heavy on the chemicals that will send one into a frenzy of overdosed delight. With precision born of hours of delicate manipulations building things that are just as deadly if not as mutable as flesh, Tony pulls away from the moment, stretching those strings ever so carefully, not wanting any of them broken, to find neutral ground where he and Stephen can come to a point they dare step off together. </p><p>They end up on the couch, fretting and shifting until they are settled and situated so that neither of them are any farther or closer together than what could be construed as anything more than two good friends, meeting after a long time apart. Facing each other, bodies turned just enough to ensure they can look at each other and resting their arms along the back of the couch, they sit in constrained silence for long seconds, waiting for words to show up and be spoken. Again gazes meet, taking in the view of the other, marking the lines and angles of the one they are watching, learning the tilt of a head, the curve of tiny smiles, wrinkles around the eyes.</p><p>Tony is the one to break the silence, remembering how Stephen deferred to him during the healing spell, how he allowed Tony to take the reins and hold the energy, a sign of trust built along previously laid foundations. Since the wink while they faced down that goon of Thanos\u2019s. </p><p>\u201cI suppose we should talk about why I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>Stephen\u2019s gaze lowers, his hands coming together to pick at some imagined flaw on a nail as he contemplates some point found on the couch cushion between them. \u201cYes, that\u2019s as good a place to start as any.\u201d</p><p>Tony fully understands the caution he hears in the other man\u2019s tone, and is grateful for it. A sensation of edging out onto the frozen surface of a lake that is deeper than can be imagined forms in his mind and is hard to shake off. The song he\u2019d been humming/singing earlier comes back to him, the words of the second verse hitting a line drive straight through his thoughts.</p><p><i>I wonder what tomorrow has in mind for me<br/>Or am I even in it&rsquo;s mind at all<br/>Perhaps I&rsquo;ll get a chance to look ahead and see<br/>Soon as I find myself a crystal ball<br/>Soon as I find myself a crystal ball</i></p><p>\u201cYou have a nice singing voice.\u201d </p><p>Stephen\u2019s comment brings Tony back from wherever it is that his mind had wandered off to. It also tells him that he\u2019d been singing those lyrics out loud, not just inside his head. His cheeks heated now, he ducks his head, finding his gaze drawn by those fingers of Stephen\u2019s once again. This time they are casually folded together, laying in the juncture where Stephen\u2019s raised leg crosses under the one still braced on the floor. Before he can stop himself with too many thoughts, Tony reaches out and takes one of them in his own hands, cupping it gently, his fingers curling around the crooked and scarred flesh. The contact helps him feel grounded again, able to focus on what he wants to say.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Stephen,\u201d Tony says his name to get him to look up. When he does, Tony squeezes the hand in his grip again and continues. \u201cI am not sure how to say what is on my mind. Ever since&hellip;since we\u2019ve, since we returned, I can\u2019t go back to, to how, to the way, I just can\u2019t\u2026\u201d</p><p>Stuttering the words out, forcing them off of his tongue until they finally come to a stop, Tony drops his gaze, defeated by his own inability to voice his deepest thoughts aloud. He slumps against the couch back, eyesight blurry as he grips those cool, slender fingers, fighting back tears of shame and dejection.</p><p>\u201cHey, it\u2019s okay,\u201d comes to him soft and low, mere whispers of comfort as Stephen\u2019s free hand covers his own, wrapping them both in a soft clasp. They stretch out over the intervening distance, hands wrapped together for moments stretching out without any measured increments. A gentle tug on his hands invites Tony to look up once again to see Stephen, his arms now outstretched, inviting him in for a hug. Aching to be held, to be needed and comforted all at once, Tony leans forward until he is up on his knees and heading for Stephen\u2019s embrace.</p><p>Somehow, Tony manages to get his arms around Stephen\u2019s waist as the doctor\u2019s arms wrap around his shoulders, pulling him up and snugging him close until they are fitted together in every curve and angle of their bodies. Tony\u2019s head rests against Stephen\u2019s chest, heart beat in his ear, susurration of breath a barely heard whisper. </p><p>\u201cMy arc reactor\u2019s not -?\u201d Tony murmurs against the blue robe, breathing deeply of the herbal and faintly burnt smell of the folded cloth.</p><p>\u201cNo, not in the least. You\u2019re fine right where you are.\u201d </p><p>Stephen\u2019s breath stirs the hairs on Tony\u2019s head, a soothing sensation that\u2019s only faintly sensual at this moment. Those long, slender fingers rub and massage Tony\u2019s rib muscles, down as far as they can reach and back up again, across the shoulders and down the spine. Thinking how right he was about the hands now touching him, he floats, at peace, until he sleeps. </p><p><b>Part 2 coming soon!</b></p><p style=\"\">\n\n<b>Comments <a href=\"https://gramaeryebard.tumblr.com/ask\">Welcome</a>!</b>\n\n<br/></p><p><b>Tagging is open!<br/></b></p><p><b>Fair warning - if you like my stuff more than once, I\u2019ll probably tag you! ^_^</b></p><p><b>Tags:</b></p><p><b>My Beta:</b> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m09OV521hCz-_Vvp1GjM34Q\">@otakustarchild</a>/<a href=\"https://psylentpoet.tumblr.com/\">@psylentpoet</a> </p><p><b>My Inspirations: </b>\u00a0<a href=\"https://cassiopeiassky.tumblr.com/\">@cassiopeiassky</a>; <a href=\"http://imagine-assembling-the-avengers.tumblr.com/\">@imagine-assembling-the-avengers</a>; </p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjecWmCvTeKd6zPRNYcQmzA\">@thinkwritexpress-official</a>; <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mnk536uY7frXwxG1tfiZclg\">@meganlpie</a>; <a href=\"http://captainrogerss.tumblr.com/post/171800009268\">@captainrogerss</a>; <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mvAB49XSMQcS3XR1XSl7yXA\">@rcmclachlan</a>; </p><p><a href=\"https://bitsandbobsandstuff.tumblr.com/\">@bitsandbobsandstuff</a>\u200b\u200b; \u00a0<a href=\"http://jrubalcaba.tumblr.com/\">@jrubalcaba</a>\u200b; \u00a0<a href=\"https://suz-123.tumblr.com/\">@suz-123</a>\u200b; <a href=\"https://tilltheendwilliwrite.tumblr.com/\">@tilltheendwilliwrite</a>; \u00a0</p><p><b>Requested and the usual suspects:</b> \u00a0<a href=\"https://capsheadquaters.tumblr.com/\">@capsheadquaters</a>; <a href=\"https://sebbytrash.tumblr.com/\">@sebbytrash</a>; <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYRPZrzgKmqk6hqZLPP07Sw\">@caplansteverogers</a>; \u00a0</p><p><a href=\"https://capandbuck.tumblr.com/\">@capandbuck</a>; <a href=\"https://wehaveabucky.tumblr.com/\">@wehaveabucky</a>; @the-shield-of-infinity-writing</p><p><a href=\"https://swanky-batman.tumblr.com/\">@swanky-batman</a>; \u00a0\u200b<a href=\"https://storyteller-le.tumblr.com/\">@storyteller-le</a>; <a href=\"https://coffee-and-mary-jane.tumblr.com/\">@coffee-and-mary-jane</a>; <a href=\"https://ficstoreadandrec.tumblr.com/\">@ficstoreadandrec</a>; <a href=\"https://vandread1989.tumblr.com/\">@vandread1989</a>; </p><p><a href=\"https://steve-rogers-personal-hell.tumblr.com/\">@steve-rogers-personal-hell\u200b</a>; <a href=\"https://101killer.tumblr.com/\">@101killer</a>; <a href=\"http://deliriousinferno.tumblr.com/\">@deliriousinferno</a>; \u00a0<a href=\"http://bionic-buckyb.tumblr.com/post/171881017295\">@bionic-buckyb\u200b\u200b</a>; <a href=\"https://whiskeyandmarvel.tumblr.com/\">@whiskeyandmarvel</a>; \u00a0</p><p><a href=\"https://amandarosemire.tumblr.com/\">@amandarosemire</a>; @<a href=\"https://until-theend-oftheline.tumblr.com/\">until-thend-oftheline</a>; <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mb9kA4SjGTbzW6XcdqbTvJQ\">@fosteringmermaids</a>; <a href=\"http://sebbystanxbuckybarnes.tumblr.com/\">@sebbystanxbuckybarnes</a></p><p><a href=\"https://aflashfan.tumblr.com/\">@aflashfan</a>; <a href=\"https://marvel-ash.tumblr.com/\">@marvel-ash</a>; <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJMZIYfYDu01BG_CqBel1ew\">@mo320</a>; <a href=\"http://all-around-geek.tumblr.com/\">@all-around-geek</a>; <a href=\"https://bojabee.tumblr.com/\">@bojabee</a>; <a href=\"https://cassiopeia-barrow.tumblr.com/\">@cassiopeia-barrow</a>; </p><p><a href=\"https://marvelfansworld.tumblr.com/\">@marvelfansworld\u200b</a>; <a href=\"https://ihaveamonsterinme.tumblr.com/\">@ihaveamonsterinme</a>; <a href=\"https://unofferable-fic.tumblr.com/\">@unofferable-fic</a>; <a href=\"https://psychoticobsession.tumblr.com/\">@psychoticobsession</a>; \u00a0</p><p> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mtaWbbBGZkg3ZgGEOAXx5ow\">@whothehellisbella</a>; \u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mwMoWhyE37A1BpH9e0rCf0Q\">@ddetraque</a>; <a href=\"https://hoechlin22.tumblr.com/\">@hoechlin22</a>; <a href=\"http://afperfect.tumblr.com/\">@afperfect</a>; <a href=\"http://agarcehasnoname.tumblr.com/\">@agarcehasnoname</a>; </p><p><a href=\"https://loratadina-makesmewanttocry.tumblr.com/\">@loratadina-makesmewanttocry</a>; <a href=\"https://bookfrog242.tumblr.com/\">@bookfrog242</a>; <a href=\"https://toaster-strudel-witch.tumblr.com/\">@toaster-strudel-witch</a>; </p><p><b>Winter Driving tags:</b></p><p><a href=\"https://chook007.tumblr.com/\">@chook007</a>; \u00a0<a href=\"https://capandbuck.tumblr.com/\">@capandbuck</a>; <a href=\"http://ghostssss.tumblr.com/\">@ghostssss</a>; <a href=\"http://imabitch-getoverit.tumblr.com/\">@imabitch-getoverit</a>; <a href=\"https://breezy1415.tumblr.com/\">@breezy1415</a>; </p><p><a href=\"https://marvelrevival.tumblr.com/\">@marvelrevival</a>; <a href=\"https://notimetoblog.tumblr.com/\">@notimetoblog</a>; <a href=\"https://ghostofanassassin.tumblr.com/\">@ghostofanassassin</a>; </p><p>If anyone wants to be tagged/untagged, let me know, k.</p>",

So he stands here, at this door, wondering if this is also a mistake.</p><p>The door opens, on its own, revealing the man he\u2019s come to see. To talk to, hopefully. Dr Strange stands there, a faint smile softening the edges of his face.</p><p>\u201cNamaste, Tony Stark. I\u2019m glad you\u2019ve come by for a visit.\u201d</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cSo you knew I was coming for a visit?\u201d Tony can\u2019t help but sound skeptical. </p><p>The faint smile bursts into its full radiance, lightening Strange\u2019s countenance immensely. \u201cNot exactly, but the probabilities were highest for this morning. Please,\u201d he steps back from the doorway, motioning inward, \u201ccome inside.\u201d</p><p>Shedding his reluctance, Tony steps through the door, hands in his pockets. He glances around, noting that Strange is wearing that blue robe that seems to be his outfit of choice when working his magic. The foyer had been repaired, something Tony had seen to, despite the doctor\u2019s protest. No one else was here, judging by the silence of the house. Strange heads toward the back of the house, bypassing the stairs.</p><p>\u201cWhat brings you here today, Tony? May I call you Tony?\u201d Strange turns his head as they walk, tossing the questions over his shoulder.</p><p>Tony shrugs. \u201cI prefer that, actually. Especially when I\u2019m being friendly.\u201d</p><p>He stops at the end of the hallway, hands still in his pockets. Head tipping sideways, he stares out over the display floor, not seeing any of the items contained there, his mind searching for an answer to the first question. After several seconds of not finding one, his gaze lowers to the floor, focusing on his shoes. A pair of boots come into view, followed by a hand on his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay to say you don\u2019t know.\u201d Strange\u2019s voice soothes him, settling over him, blanketing him unexpectedly in comfort. He releases his grip on Tony\u2019s shoulder and turns back the way he\u2019d been heading. \u201cPerhaps we can figure something out while you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>Following slowly behind, Tony starts humming the tune that pops into his head. After the opening bars and first two verses, he begins singing, softly, barely breathing the words of the chorus. </p><p><i>Tell me, tell me where I\u2019m going<br>I don\u2019t know where I\u2019ve been<br>Tell me, tell me, won\u2019t you tell me<br>And then tell me again<br>My heart is breaking, my body\u2019s aching<br>And I don\u2019t know where to go<br>Tell me, tell me, won\u2019t you tell me<br>I\u2019ve just got to know</i></p><p>\u201c<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSuQbF9suqA\">Crystal Ball</a>. Styx. 1976 from the album of the same name. Released again on the Caught in the Act album, 1984. And again in 1997 on the Return to Paradise album. One of Tommy Shaw\u2019s best songs, ever. In my opinion.\u201d Strange returns to Tony\u2019s side with a mug of something steaming in each hand and gives one to Tony with a smug little grin. Tony recognizes that grin. It\u2019s the same as the one that he gets when he is showing off. It\u2019s been a long time since he\u2019s had a reason to use it.</p><p>\u201cWow, you\u2019re kidding me. Now that\u2019s impressive.\u201d Tony hasn\u2019t had anyone show off for him in a long time, either. He takes the drink, noting that the mug is cool, even while the liquid steams within it. Magic, he supposes, taking a drink as he thinks of a couple different ways that could be made to happen with technology. Not that he\u2019d ever have a chance to make a device to do that. His inner scoffing gets interrupted by the taste of whatever is in this cup. </p><p>\u201cThis is amazing! What is it?\u201d He turns to find Strange, the doctor having stepped out of view again, leaving Tony standing in the middle of an area whose boundaries are defined by a couple of leather couches and a high wooden desk covered in books and papers that appear to be antiques, or at least old and handmade. He wonders if he should call the man Dr Strange, though that feels so formal at this point. </p><p>\u201cCall me Stephen. I think we are on good enough terms for that, don\u2019t you, Tony?\u201d Stephen has walked up behind him and is staring at his back. Or he was, as Tony spins around to find him standing there, chin in hand, elbow on wrist, concerned look on his face, eyes focused where Tony\u2019s spine had been a few seconds ago. </p><p>\u201cAnd, it\u2019s just tea, with a little honey. A special blend I put together to help with anxiety and nerves. Don\u2019t worry. I drink it all the time.\u201d He waves his hand, smiling as Tony\u2019s mug fills back up with the steaming liquid. \u201cWhen was the last time you visited a doctor about your insomnia and anxiety?\u201d</p><p>Tony nearly spit his tea over the front of Stephen\u2019s blue robe. As it is, he chokes a couple of times on the drops of liquid that have gotten caught in his windpipe, sucking in air and coughing it out as Stephen pats his back. One last time, he coughs and then his lungs are clear, though his head is spinning now, from the influx of oxygen and from the concern in Stephen\u2019s voice. Like that smug little grin, Tony isn\u2019t sure when the last time he\u2019d had that question asked of him. He forgets that Strange, no-no, Stephen, is actually a doctor. The magic, among other things, had distracted him from that fact.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t been vetted by a medical doctor for more than scratches and bruises in, oh,\u201d pausing to think back, Tony is interrupted by Stephen shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cThat is entirely too long and unacceptable. May I take a look?\u201d He holds out his hands for Tony to give his shirt up, only to see the confused look on the genius\u2019s face. \u201cYour shirt please, Tony. I\u2019d like to -\u201d</p><p>\u201cExamine me? Play doctor with me?\u201d Tony hands over his mug and allows a mischievous grin to play across his lips as he starts to unzip his running jacket a little at a time, shaking his hips to each side as he starts to make snare drum sounds. \u00a0To his surprise, Stephen sets the mug on the nearby desk and stands there, hands on hips, tossing his head back in laughter.</p><p>\u201cOh this ought to be interesting. Maybe I should ask you to take it all off, if you\u2019re going to give me a show?\u201d His grin is full, accompanied by raised eyebrows as he watches Tony get to the bottom of the zipper and pull open one side of the jacket, showing his still-clothed shoulder. </p><p>Tony gives his shoulder a little wiggle, blowing a kiss toward Stephen. \u201cYou okay with this, doc?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell you could do it a little faster, but if this gets your shirt off, then I\u2019m fine. I\u2019ll try to stay professional for the exam, then we can talk about personal preferences later. Say, over dinner?\u201d </p><p>The one eyebrow that remains raised tells Tony that the man really is seriously asking him out, right now, even as Tony is undressing for him. Heat flashes through him, head to loins, leaving him flustered and caught off-guard. He stops dancing and pulls the jacket off, giving the doctor a sassy grin, though his eyelids flutter down as he finds himself unable to look Stephen in the eye at this moment. The jacket lands on the couch with his toss, followed by the shirt. Tony resists the urge to flex, though he does tighten his stomach muscles a little.</p><p>A low whistle comes from Stephen\u2019s pursed lips as he views Tony\u2019s upper body, from his sculpted abs up to the cut pecs and deltoids. Every part of the man\u2019s torso is defined and toned. Stephen had figured that managing the flexibility and movement of the Iron Man suit would keep Tony in shape, but it definitely looks like the man has done more on his own beyond the strictly necessary maintenance. Besides showing appreciation, he really likes how the red of Tony\u2019s cheeks looks against his tan skin and the sultry smile that is being held back but still curves those lips. </p><p>Raising his gaze, Tony finds himself being appraised very frankly, both professionally and with personal interest. He\u2019s certain this is what a specimen on display must feel like, though with Stephen, he has a brief moment of confusion, experiencing both attraction and shyness toward his examiner. </p><p>His attraction to the man has been in him since their first meeting, standing in the foyer of this house, discussing Infinity Stones and flavors of ice cream. The fact that Stephen had known the flavor Ben and Jerry\u2019s had named after him, but then gave it a less than stellar review in only a few words, had lit the fire. Now, after everything they\u2019d been through, Tony almost can\u2019t believe that the attraction is reciprocated. He\u2019d been sure they\u2019d become friends, albeit reluctantly on Stephen\u2019s part, but finding out that it\u2019s more than just intellectual is exciting, and daunting. This sudden rush of nerves can only be from Tony\u2019s desire to not mess things up. </p><p>\u201cMay I?\u201d Stephen\u2019s request interrupts Tony\u2019s inner monologue as the doctor steps closer. </p><p>Tony notices the red cloak has removed itself from Stephen\u2019s shoulders and taken up a position behind the couch, hanging there like a watchful butler. An unexpected memory of Jarvis hits him out of the blue, bringing a sniff to him against the briefest whiff of nostalgia.</p><p>\u201cSure thing, Doc. Just tell me what you want me to do.\u201d Tony replies, catching a brief smirk as Stephen walks around him and again takes up a position behind him. </p><p>\u201cFor right now,\u201d Stephen\u2019s words are slow, drawn out as though he is concentrating on something other than speaking, \u201cI just need you to remain still and relaxed. You can talk, if you like.\u201d</p><p>Hooking his thumb in the waistband of his pants, Tony realizes he doesn\u2019t feel the urge to talk, to fill the empty spaces, like he usually does. He\u2019s got a weird itch between his shoulder blades, though Stephen hasn\u2019t lain a finger on him yet, to his dismay. He wants to have those hands on him, touching him. His imagination has been telling him how gentle and unobtrusive that touch would be, but for now, he has to settle for eyes only. Words do come to mind after a couple of minutes of silence. </p><p>\u201cWell, Doc, what\u2019s the prognosis? Is it fatal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLife is always fatal, if not deadly, Tony.\u201d Low and rumbly, Stephen\u2019s words are tinged with a bit of laughter that brings an answering smile to Tony\u2019s lips. He\u2019s about to respond when Stephen continues. \u201cYou are in remarkably good condition, physically. Your aura is a mess, and your chakra points need cleansed, which I can do for you, no problem. The worst is your spinal column. With these compression fractures and pinched nerves, it\u2019s a wonder you\u2019re not in more pain than you are. Your endorphin level is through the roof, and your serotonin production is out of whack, as are your lymphatic and endocrine systems. Explains the insomnia and a lot of the anxiety.\u201d</p><p>Thrown off by Stephen\u2019s reference to chakra points and endocrine systems, along with everything else he\u2019d said, all jumbled together and delivered in the tone he\u2019d expect to hear from an auto mechanic, Tony remains silent. He resists the urge to watch as Stephen walks around him, mumbling words in languages he doesn\u2019t understand. When Stephen comes to a stop behind him, Tony takes a deep breath, expecting to be poked and prodded like any other doctor would. Instead, hearing a low hum start up, he tries to turn his head to see what is happening.</p><p>\u201cTssss, hold still please.\u201d Stephen\u2019s near-whisper of a request stops his head mid-turn. </p><p>\u201cCan I straighten my head back?\u201d Tony murmurs the question from the side of his mouth, his neck muscles protesting the odd angle.</p><p>\u201cYes, please. This will just take a minute once everything is set.\u201d Concentration is evident in Stephen\u2019s tone, as though he is holding something in place until Tony is ready.</p><p>Tony moves his head back to the front cautiously, not sure what Stephen is doing, but certain it is complicated, going by the doctor\u2019s tone. The hum continues, reminding him of high-voltage transformers, or the giant arc-reactor he used to have on display so many years ago. His back feels twitchy and he can sense actual energy, like heat but not hot, coming off of whatever Stephen had started back there. Once his head is back in position, he hears more of the snap and hum behind him. </p><p>\u201cAlright, everything is set up and ready. This is going to be strange and maybe a bit like touching an electric fence, but you\u2019ll start to feel better once it\u2019s done.\u201d Behind him, Stephen manages to sound confident and cautious, the susurration of cloth underlying the murmur of his voice. \u201cMay I proceed?\u201d</p><p>Tony chuckles to himself a bit at Stephen describing something as strange. Increasing in pitch, the hum of whatever is behind him gives him pause, causing him to evaluate how much he trusts the man that is creating this buzz of energy. It\u2019s as though his bones are beginning to vibrate at the same frequency of the hum, charging his senses and fueling his anticipation. An odd desire ignites in his chest, even as the arc reactor there starts to hum as well. Resisting the urge to bounce or move in anyway, Tony gives a quick, sharp nod.</p><p>A sharply exhaled vocalization comes from Stephen, similar to that used by martial artists when performing strength moves. Energy hits Tony in the back, a framework connecting points of himself as though wires had been strung between them. Shoulder to chest, chest to loins, knees to feet and back up through his spine to his head. At his forehead, light blossoms, turning the room an unknown degree, like it had been spun on an axis and he is trying to view it as it spins. His hands float up, palms filling with light as well, reminding him of repulsors, though he has no armor, no suit around him. </p><p>He glances down as his feet begin to feel the same, laughing as he sees the floor falling slowly away from his body. The hum encompasses him now, buzzing throughout his entirety, filling him with light, lifting him from the floor. A thought that he wants to see Stephen\u2019s face at this sight is conceived and acted upon without a break between, his physical being turning around to face the man behind him. For a moment, the room spins beyond what he can see with his eyes, yet he doesn\u2019t lose track of what he is seeing. It bounds back, rebounding back and forth until he thinks that it needs to stop, so it does. He knows he is grinning as he floats there, holding the framework in his thoughts, sure that it wasn\u2019t supposed to last this long but unwilling to let it go, to let this feeling go. </p><p>The look of awe on Stephen\u2019s face is wonderous, filling Tony\u2019s chest with an emotion he hasn\u2019t been privy to very often, one that he is reluctant to admit he can feel. Instead, he winks and grins as Stephen holds out his hands, beckoning him to let go of the energy and return to physical existence. Tony doesn\u2019t want to, but years of self-monitoring and biofeedback tells him his heart is racing. Thinking of it allows him to hear his pulse, the rush of blood surging through his veins, the actual beat of his heart, damaged though it is, strong and steady. </p><p>Threads of gold and white in that area of his body attract his attention and he sees how some of them are tangled and knotted, causing slight irregularities in the rhythm of the heart muscle. He starts to move closer but is interrupted by Stephen\u2019s voice calling to him, asking him to return, reminding him that he should be focusing on the whole, not individual pieces. Withdrawing his focus, Tony returns to looking at Stephen looking at him. His grin returning, his entire being relaxed and energized, he lets go of the energy framework and thumps gently back to the floor. </p><p>Stephen\u2019s mouth hangs open for a couple of seconds before he closes it with a click, swallowing hard to clear his throat so he can speak. He has performed this cleansing several times since he learned the incantations for it, but in the time that has passed since it was first shown to him, he has never seen anyone not already an adept take control of the healing energy in this manner. He\u2019s also never felt this way when someone has looked at him before, whether or not they were encased in illuminating energy. The experience has rendered him speechless. </p><p>From the first time he\u2019d met Tony, in his foyer after convincing him to step through the portal in the park that fateful day, Stephen could feel the energy bleeding from him. It charged the air between them, starting with snippets and jabs at each other, changing to something better the moment Tony had stepped out in front of the four of them to face down Thanos\u2019s minion without hesitation. The smile he\u2019d received after winking at Tony had sent his heart flipping out of control. It had the heady feeling of jumping from the top of a cliff, sure you can fly but weightless and freefalling until the moment your method of descent control kicks in. </p><p>Now, doing what he can to help Tony return to the health and strength he hasn\u2019t enjoyed in many years, Stephen finds that yet again, he is surprised and left in freefall, trying to catch up, a sensation that only this man in front of him has given him. Holding out his hands, he holds back the emotions that are running rampant through him, not sure that he is ready to share them or that Tony feels the same way. So much has happened and now that things are getting back to normal, he hesitates to impose. After all, Tony is still engaged to someone else. </p><p>\u201cAre you alright? That was quite the feat.\u201d Stephen somehow manages to keep his voice smooth and even, despite how unsteady he is inside. </p><p>\u201cI feel fabulous!\u201d Tony gives Stephen\u2019s hands a light squeeze, glad to have something to hold onto. Bouncing in place now that he no longer has to hold still, he grins yet again at Stephen, overjoyed with everything right now. When Stephen grins back and winks at him, he almost jumps to hug him, then holds back, not sure how that would be received. </p><p>Staring into each other\u2019s eyes, they lose track of time, seconds passing by without notice, until they do and step back so quickly it\u2019s nearly a jump, each regretting the breaking of the moment\u2019s lucid silence, yet afraid to be caught in the act. Fear is the killer of such moments, one or the other worrying, thinking too much, concerned over the reaction of people that aren\u2019t even around to judge. The shuffling of feet and clearing of throats cover the unexpected burst of affections brought out by the connection they have established between them. </p><p>Tony, used to being caught out in the open, to hiding his true self behind meaningless banter, is the first to speak. \u201cSo, how many bedrooms does this place have? Care to give me a tour? I\u2019ve been dying to see the rest of the place\u2026\u201d</p><p>His words trail off, the usual meaningless banter not so meaningless now, not after what has happened so very recently. Too recent to not have more weight than intended. </p><p>Stephen wants to make light of that phrase, joke about coming back just for that reason, but he is still too stunned from what Tony did with the healing spell for the words to fall so easily from his mouth. Mostly it\u2019s the fear that something inappropriate to the moment will fall out instead. He settles for a wry smile, one side of his face twisting upward while the other half holds back the urge to step closer, get closer, up into personal space that hasn\u2019t been opened for him yet. The signs are there, it wouldn\u2019t be unwelcome, but there\u2019s a difference between not unwelcome and invited, as much as there is between no reason not to and every reason to wait. </p><p>Seeing that wry smile sit on Stephen\u2019s face, Tony gets the implication of words held back and knows, implicitly, deep down in those parts of him that he thought had drowned long ago, that this is his show. His call, his move, his dance to lead. The tension now is so thick he can feel it, invisible but burning as hot as anything he\u2019s ever experienced stretching taut between them. Power of this magnitude is heady, light on oxygen, heavy on the chemicals that will send one into a frenzy of overdosed delight. With precision born of hours of delicate manipulations building things that are just as deadly if not as mutable as flesh, Tony pulls away from the moment, stretching those strings ever so carefully, not wanting any of them broken, to find neutral ground where he and Stephen can come to a point they dare step off together. </p><p>They end up on the couch, fretting and shifting until they are settled and situated so that neither of them are any farther or closer together than what could be construed as anything more than two good friends, meeting after a long time apart. Facing each other, bodies turned just enough to ensure they can look at each other and resting their arms along the back of the couch, they sit in constrained silence for long seconds, waiting for words to show up and be spoken. Again gazes meet, taking in the view of the other, marking the lines and angles of the one they are watching, learning the tilt of a head, the curve of tiny smiles, wrinkles around the eyes.</p><p>Tony is the one to break the silence, remembering how Stephen deferred to him during the healing spell, how he allowed Tony to take the reins and hold the energy, a sign of trust built along previously laid foundations. Since the wink while they faced down that goon of Thanos\u2019s. </p><p>\u201cI suppose we should talk about why I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>Stephen\u2019s gaze lowers, his hands coming together to pick at some imagined flaw on a nail as he contemplates some point found on the couch cushion between them. \u201cYes, that\u2019s as good a place to start as any.\u201d</p><p>Tony fully understands the caution he hears in the other man\u2019s tone, and is grateful for it. A sensation of edging out onto the frozen surface of a lake that is deeper than can be imagined forms in his mind and is hard to shake off. The song he\u2019d been humming/singing earlier comes back to him, the words of the second verse hitting a line drive straight through his thoughts.</p><p><i>I wonder what tomorrow has in mind for me<br>Or am I even in it\u2019s mind at all<br>Perhaps I\u2019ll get a chance to look ahead and see<br>Soon as I find myself a crystal ball<br>Soon as I find myself a crystal ball</i></p><p>\u201cYou have a nice singing voice.\u201d </p><p>Stephen\u2019s comment brings Tony back from wherever it is that his mind had wandered off to. It also tells him that he\u2019d been singing those lyrics out loud, not just inside his head. His cheeks heated now, he ducks his head, finding his gaze drawn by those fingers of Stephen\u2019s once again. This time they are casually folded together, laying in the juncture where Stephen\u2019s raised leg crosses under the one still braced on the floor. Before he can stop himself with too many thoughts, Tony reaches out and takes one of them in his own hands, cupping it gently, his fingers curling around the crooked and scarred flesh. The contact helps him feel grounded again, able to focus on what he wants to say.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Stephen,\u201d Tony says his name to get him to look up. When he does, Tony squeezes the hand in his grip again and continues. \u201cI am not sure how to say what is on my mind. Ever since\u2026since we\u2019ve, since we returned, I can\u2019t go back to, to how, to the way, I just can\u2019t\u2026\u201d</p><p>Stuttering the words out, forcing them off of his tongue until they finally come to a stop, Tony drops his gaze, defeated by his own inability to voice his deepest thoughts aloud. He slumps against the couch back, eyesight blurry as he grips those cool, slender fingers, fighting back tears of shame and dejection.</p><p>\u201cHey, it\u2019s okay,\u201d comes to him soft and low, mere whispers of comfort as Stephen\u2019s free hand covers his own, wrapping them both in a soft clasp. They stretch out over the intervening distance, hands wrapped together for moments stretching out without any measured increments. A gentle tug on his hands invites Tony to look up once again to see Stephen, his arms now outstretched, inviting him in for a hug. Aching to be held, to be needed and comforted all at once, Tony leans forward until he is up on his knees and heading for Stephen\u2019s embrace.</p><p>Somehow, Tony manages to get his arms around Stephen\u2019s waist as the doctor\u2019s arms wrap around his shoulders, pulling him up and snugging him close until they are fitted together in every curve and angle of their bodies. Tony\u2019s head rests against Stephen\u2019s chest, heart beat in his ear, susurration of breath a barely heard whisper. </p><p>\u201cMy arc reactor\u2019s not -?\u201d Tony murmurs against the blue robe, breathing deeply of the herbal and faintly burnt smell of the folded cloth.</p><p>\u201cNo, not in the least. You\u2019re fine right where you are.\u201d </p><p>Stephen\u2019s breath stirs the hairs on Tony\u2019s head, a soothing sensation that\u2019s only faintly sensual at this moment. Those long, slender fingers rub and massage Tony\u2019s rib muscles, down as far as they can reach and back up again, across the shoulders and down the spine. Thinking how right he was about the hands now touching him, he floats, at peace, until he sleeps. </p><p><b>Part 2 coming soon!</b></p><p style=\"\">\n\n<b>Comments <a href=\"https://gramaeryebard.tumblr.com/ask\">Welcome</a>!</b>\n\n<br></p><p><b>Tagging is open!<br></b></p><p><b>Fair warning - if you like my stuff more than once, I\u2019ll probably tag you! ^_^</b></p><p><b>Tags:</b></p><p><b>My Beta:</b> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m09OV521hCz-_Vvp1GjM34Q\">@otakustarchild</a>/<a href=\"https://psylentpoet.tumblr.com/\">@psylentpoet</a> </p><p><b>My Inspirations: </b>\u00a0<a href=\"https://cassiopeiassky.tumblr.com/\">@cassiopeiassky</a>; <a href=\"http://imagine-assembling-the-avengers.tumblr.com/\">@imagine-assembling-the-avengers</a>; </p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjecWmCvTeKd6zPRNYcQmzA\">@thinkwritexpress-official</a>; <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mnk536uY7frXwxG1tfiZclg\">@meganlpie</a>; <a href=\"http://captainrogerss.tumblr.com/post/171800009268\">@captainrogerss</a>; <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mvAB49XSMQcS3XR1XSl7yXA\">@rcmclachlan</a>; </p><p><a href=\"https://bitsandbobsandstuff.tumblr.com/\">@bitsandbobsandstuff</a>\u200b\u200b; \u00a0<a href=\"http://jrubalcaba.tumblr.com/\">@jrubalcaba</a>\u200b; \u00a0<a href=\"https://suz-123.tumblr.com/\">@suz-123</a>\u200b; <a href=\"https://tilltheendwilliwrite.tumblr.com/\">@tilltheendwilliwrite</a>; \u00a0</p><p><b>Requested and the usual suspects:</b> \u00a0<a href=\"https://capsheadquaters.tumblr.com/\">@capsheadquaters</a>; <a href=\"https://sebbytrash.tumblr.com/\">@sebbytrash</a>; <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYRPZrzgKmqk6hqZLPP07Sw\">@caplansteverogers</a>; \u00a0</p><p><a href=\"https://capandbuck.tumblr.com/\">@capandbuck</a>; <a href=\"https://wehaveabucky.tumblr.com/\">@wehaveabucky</a>; @the-shield-of-infinity-writing</p><p><a href=\"https://swanky-batman.tumblr.com/\">@swanky-batman</a>; \u00a0\u200b<a href=\"https://storyteller-le.tumblr.com/\">@storyteller-le</a>; <a href=\"https://coffee-and-mary-jane.tumblr.com/\">@coffee-and-mary-jane</a>; <a href=\"https://ficstoreadandrec.tumblr.com/\">@ficstoreadandrec</a>; <a href=\"https://vandread1989.tumblr.com/\">@vandread1989</a>; </p><p><a href=\"https://steve-rogers-personal-hell.tumblr.com/\">@steve-rogers-personal-hell\u200b</a>; <a href=\"https://101killer.tumblr.com/\">@101killer</a>; <a href=\"http://deliriousinferno.tumblr.com/\">@deliriousinferno</a>; \u00a0<a href=\"http://bionic-buckyb.tumblr.com/post/171881017295\">@bionic-buckyb\u200b\u200b</a>; <a href=\"https://whiskeyandmarvel.tumblr.com/\">@whiskeyandmarvel</a>; \u00a0</p><p><a href=\"https://amandarosemire.tumblr.com/\">@amandarosemire</a>; @<a href=\"https://until-theend-oftheline.tumblr.com/\">until-thend-oftheline</a>; <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mb9kA4SjGTbzW6XcdqbTvJQ\">@fosteringmermaids</a>; <a href=\"http://sebbystanxbuckybarnes.tumblr.com/\">@sebbystanxbuckybarnes</a></p><p><a href=\"https://aflashfan.tumblr.com/\">@aflashfan</a>; <a href=\"https://marvel-ash.tumblr.com/\">@marvel-ash</a>; <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJMZIYfYDu01BG_CqBel1ew\">@mo320</a>; <a href=\"http://all-around-geek.tumblr.com/\">@all-around-geek</a>; <a href=\"https://bojabee.tumblr.com/\">@bojabee</a>; <a href=\"https://cassiopeia-barrow.tumblr.com/\">@cassiopeia-barrow</a>; </p><p><a href=\"https://marvelfansworld.tumblr.com/\">@marvelfansworld\u200b</a>; <a href=\"https://ihaveamonsterinme.tumblr.com/\">@ihaveamonsterinme</a>; <a href=\"https://unofferable-fic.tumblr.com/\">@unofferable-fic</a>; <a href=\"https://psychoticobsession.tumblr.com/\">@psychoticobsession</a>; \u00a0</p><p> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mtaWbbBGZkg3ZgGEOAXx5ow\">@whothehellisbella</a>; \u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mwMoWhyE37A1BpH9e0rCf0Q\">@ddetraque</a>; <a href=\"https://hoechlin22.tumblr.com/\">@hoechlin22</a>; <a href=\"http://afperfect.tumblr.com/\">@afperfect</a>; <a href=\"http://agarcehasnoname.tumblr.com/\">@agarcehasnoname</a>; </p><p><a href=\"https://loratadina-makesmewanttocry.tumblr.com/\">@loratadina-makesmewanttocry</a>; <a href=\"https://bookfrog242.tumblr.com/\">@bookfrog242</a>; <a href=\"https://toaster-strudel-witch.tumblr.com/\">@toaster-strudel-witch</a>; </p><p><b>Winter Driving tags:</b></p><p><a href=\"https://chook007.tumblr.com/\">@chook007</a>; \u00a0<a href=\"https://capandbuck.tumblr.com/\">@capandbuck</a>; <a href=\"http://ghostssss.tumblr.com/\">@ghostssss</a>; <a href=\"http://imabitch-getoverit.tumblr.com/\">@imabitch-getoverit</a>; <a href=\"https://breezy1415.tumblr.com/\">@breezy1415</a>; </p><p><a href=\"https://marvelrevival.tumblr.com/\">@marvelrevival</a>; <a href=\"https://notimetoblog.tumblr.com/\">@notimetoblog</a>; <a href=\"https://ghostofanassassin.tumblr.com/\">@ghostofanassassin</a>; </p><p>If anyone wants to be tagged/untagged, let me know, k.</p>",

Lost in thought, he takes no interest in his surroundings until his feet stop at one particular set of stairs. They aren\u2019t imposing, being only two steps between door and sidewalk. Three if he counts the top one. The area between the stair and door isn\u2019t imposing either, a few steps and he\u2019s there. He studied the door, noting how ordinary and typical it is. There\u2019s two of them, to be precise, and when has he not been precise?</p><p>He considers knocking, though he doesn\u2019t want to be a bother to anyone. Which is why he went for a walk in the first place. A note had been left behind, on his work bench, letting anyone who cared to read it that he is going to the city for a few days off. It\u2019s not like he didn\u2019t deserve it. By his calculations, he could go on vacation for the rest of his life and not use up all his time, if he worked a regular job. Which he didn\u2019t.</p><p>It baffles him why he\u2019s here, at this door, right now. At least, that\u2019s what he tells himself. Like he doesn\u2019t know why he came this way. Nothing else makes sense. That, above all else, is what brings him here. He doesn\u2019t know where else he could go. Nobody he knows understands the dilemma he is facing. So he stands here, at this door, wondering if this is also a mistake.</p><p>The door opens, on its own, revealing the man he\u2019s come to see. To talk to, hopefully. Dr Strange stands there, a faint smile softening the edges of his face.</p><p>\u201cNamaste, Tony Stark. I\u2019m glad you\u2019ve come by for a visit.\u201d</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cSo you knew I was coming for a visit?\u201d Tony can\u2019t help but sound skeptical. </p><p>The faint smile bursts into its full radiance, lightening Strange\u2019s countenance immensely. \u201cNot exactly, but the probabilities were highest for this morning. Please,\u201d he steps back from the doorway, motioning inward, \u201ccome inside.\u201d</p><p>Shedding his reluctance, Tony steps through the door, hands in his pockets. He glances around, noting that Strange is wearing that blue robe that seems to be his outfit of choice when working his magic. The foyer had been repaired, something Tony had seen to, despite the doctor\u2019s protest. No one else was here, judging by the silence of the house. Strange heads toward the back of the house, bypassing the stairs.</p><p>\u201cWhat brings you here today, Tony? May I call you Tony?\u201d Strange turns his head as they walk, tossing the questions over his shoulder.</p><p>Tony shrugs. \u201cI prefer that, actually. Especially when I\u2019m being friendly.\u201d</p><p>He stops at the end of the hallway, hands still in his pockets. Head tipping sideways, he stares out over the display floor, not seeing any of the items contained there, his mind searching for an answer to the first question. After several seconds of not finding one, his gaze lowers to the floor, focusing on his shoes. A pair of boots come into view, followed by a hand on his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay to say you don\u2019t know.\u201d Strange\u2019s voice soothes him, settling over him, blanketing him unexpectedly in comfort. He releases his grip on Tony\u2019s shoulder and turns back the way he\u2019d been heading. \u201cPerhaps we can figure something out while you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>Following slowly behind, Tony starts humming the tune that pops into his head. After the opening bars and first two verses, he begins singing, softly, barely breathing the words of the chorus. </p><p><i>Tell me, tell me where I\u2019m going<br>I don\u2019t know where I\u2019ve been<br>Tell me, tell me, won\u2019t you tell me<br>And then tell me again<br>My heart is breaking, my body\u2019s aching<br>And I don\u2019t know where to go<br>Tell me, tell me, won\u2019t you tell me<br>I\u2019ve just got to know</i></p><p>\u201c<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSuQbF9suqA\">Crystal Ball</a>. Styx. 1976 from the album of the same name. Released again on the Caught in the Act album, 1984. And again in 1997 on the Return to Paradise album. One of Tommy Shaw\u2019s best songs, ever. In my opinion.\u201d Strange returns to Tony\u2019s side with a mug of something steaming in each hand and gives one to Tony with a smug little grin. Tony recognizes that grin. It\u2019s the same as the one that he gets when he is showing off. It\u2019s been a long time since he\u2019s had a reason to use it.</p><p>\u201cWow, you\u2019re kidding me. Now that\u2019s impressive.\u201d Tony hasn\u2019t had anyone show off for him in a long time, either. He takes the drink, noting that the mug is cool, even while the liquid steams within it. Magic, he supposes, taking a drink as he thinks of a couple different ways that could be made to happen with technology. Not that he\u2019d ever have a chance to make a device to do that. His inner scoffing gets interrupted by the taste of whatever is in this cup. </p><p>\u201cThis is amazing! What is it?\u201d He turns to find Strange, the doctor having stepped out of view again, leaving Tony standing in the middle of an area whose boundaries are defined by a couple of leather couches and a high wooden desk covered in books and papers that appear to be antiques, or at least old and handmade. He wonders if he should call the man Dr Strange, though that feels so formal at this point. </p><p>\u201cCall me Stephen. I think we are on good enough terms for that, don\u2019t you, Tony?\u201d Stephen has walked up behind him and is staring at his back. Or he was, as Tony spins around to find him standing there, chin in hand, elbow on wrist, concerned look on his face, eyes focused where Tony\u2019s spine had been a few seconds ago. </p><p>\u201cAnd, it\u2019s just tea, with a little honey. A special blend I put together to help with anxiety and nerves. Don\u2019t worry. I drink it all the time.\u201d He waves his hand, smiling as Tony\u2019s mug fills back up with the steaming liquid. \u201cWhen was the last time you visited a doctor about your insomnia and anxiety?\u201d</p><p>Tony nearly spit his tea over the front of Stephen\u2019s blue robe. As it is, he chokes a couple of times on the drops of liquid that have gotten caught in his windpipe, sucking in air and coughing it out as Stephen pats his back. One last time, he coughs and then his lungs are clear, though his head is spinning now, from the influx of oxygen and from the concern in Stephen\u2019s voice. Like that smug little grin, Tony isn\u2019t sure when the last time he\u2019d had that question asked of him. He forgets that Strange, no-no, Stephen, is actually a doctor. The magic, among other things, had distracted him from that fact.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t been vetted by a medical doctor for more than scratches and bruises in, oh,\u201d pausing to think back, Tony is interrupted by Stephen shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cThat is entirely too long and unacceptable. May I take a look?\u201d He holds out his hands for Tony to give his shirt up, only to see the confused look on the genius\u2019s face. \u201cYour shirt please, Tony. I\u2019d like to -\u201d</p><p>\u201cExamine me? Play doctor with me?\u201d Tony hands over his mug and allows a mischievous grin to play across his lips as he starts to unzip his running jacket a little at a time, shaking his hips to each side as he starts to make snare drum sounds. \u00a0To his surprise, Stephen sets the mug on the nearby desk and stands there, hands on hips, tossing his head back in laughter.</p><p>\u201cOh this ought to be interesting. Maybe I should ask you to take it all off, if you\u2019re going to give me a show?\u201d His grin is full, accompanied by raised eyebrows as he watches Tony get to the bottom of the zipper and pull open one side of the jacket, showing his still-clothed shoulder. </p><p>Tony gives his shoulder a little wiggle, blowing a kiss toward Stephen. \u201cYou okay with this, doc?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell you could do it a little faster, but if this gets your shirt off, then I\u2019m fine. I\u2019ll try to stay professional for the exam, then we can talk about personal preferences later. Say, over dinner?\u201d </p><p>The one eyebrow that remains raised tells Tony that the man really is seriously asking him out, right now, even as Tony is undressing for him. Heat flashes through him, head to loins, leaving him flustered and caught off-guard. He stops dancing and pulls the jacket off, giving the doctor a sassy grin, though his eyelids flutter down as he finds himself unable to look Stephen in the eye at this moment. The jacket lands on the couch with his toss, followed by the shirt. Tony resists the urge to flex, though he does tighten his stomach muscles a little.</p><p>A low whistle comes from Stephen\u2019s pursed lips as he views Tony\u2019s upper body, from his sculpted abs up to the cut pecs and deltoids. Every part of the man\u2019s torso is defined and toned. Stephen had figured that managing the flexibility and movement of the Iron Man suit would keep Tony in shape, but it definitely looks like the man has done more on his own beyond the strictly necessary maintenance. Besides showing appreciation, he really likes how the red of Tony\u2019s cheeks looks against his tan skin and the sultry smile that is being held back but still curves those lips. </p><p>Raising his gaze, Tony finds himself being appraised very frankly, both professionally and with personal interest. He\u2019s certain this is what a specimen on display must feel like, though with Stephen, he has a brief moment of confusion, experiencing both attraction and shyness toward his examiner. </p><p>His attraction to the man has been in him since their first meeting, standing in the foyer of this house, discussing Infinity Stones and flavors of ice cream. The fact that Stephen had known the flavor Ben and Jerry\u2019s had named after him, but then gave it a less than stellar review in only a few words, had lit the fire. Now, after everything they\u2019d been through, Tony almost can\u2019t believe that the attraction is reciprocated. He\u2019d been sure they\u2019d become friends, albeit reluctantly on Stephen\u2019s part, but finding out that it\u2019s more than just intellectual is exciting, and daunting. This sudden rush of nerves can only be from Tony\u2019s desire to not mess things up. </p><p>\u201cMay I?\u201d Stephen\u2019s request interrupts Tony\u2019s inner monologue as the doctor steps closer. </p><p>Tony notices the red cloak has removed itself from Stephen\u2019s shoulders and taken up a position behind the couch, hanging there like a watchful butler. An unexpected memory of Jarvis hits him out of the blue, bringing a sniff to him against the briefest whiff of nostalgia.</p><p>\u201cSure thing, Doc. Just tell me what you want me to do.\u201d Tony replies, catching a brief smirk as Stephen walks around him and again takes up a position behind him. </p><p>\u201cFor right now,\u201d Stephen\u2019s words are slow, drawn out as though he is concentrating on something other than speaking, \u201cI just need you to remain still and relaxed. You can talk, if you like.\u201d</p><p>Hooking his thumb in the waistband of his pants, Tony realizes he doesn\u2019t feel the urge to talk, to fill the empty spaces, like he usually does. He\u2019s got a weird itch between his shoulder blades, though Stephen hasn\u2019t lain a finger on him yet, to his dismay. He wants to have those hands on him, touching him. His imagination has been telling him how gentle and unobtrusive that touch would be, but for now, he has to settle for eyes only. Words do come to mind after a couple of minutes of silence. </p><p>\u201cWell, Doc, what\u2019s the prognosis? Is it fatal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLife is always fatal, if not deadly, Tony.\u201d Low and rumbly, Stephen\u2019s words are tinged with a bit of laughter that brings an answering smile to Tony\u2019s lips. He\u2019s about to respond when Stephen continues. \u201cYou are in remarkably good condition, physically. Your aura is a mess, and your chakra points need cleansed, which I can do for you, no problem. The worst is your spinal column. With these compression fractures and pinched nerves, it\u2019s a wonder you\u2019re not in more pain than you are. Your endorphin level is through the roof, and your serotonin production is out of whack, as are your lymphatic and endocrine systems. Explains the insomnia and a lot of the anxiety.\u201d</p><p>Thrown off by Stephen\u2019s reference to chakra points and endocrine systems, along with everything else he\u2019d said, all jumbled together and delivered in the tone he\u2019d expect to hear from an auto mechanic, Tony remains silent. He resists the urge to watch as Stephen walks around him, mumbling words in languages he doesn\u2019t understand. When Stephen comes to a stop behind him, Tony takes a deep breath, expecting to be poked and prodded like any other doctor would. Instead, hearing a low hum start up, he tries to turn his head to see what is happening.</p><p>\u201cTssss, hold still please.\u201d Stephen\u2019s near-whisper of a request stops his head mid-turn. </p><p>\u201cCan I straighten my head back?\u201d Tony murmurs the question from the side of his mouth, his neck muscles protesting the odd angle.</p><p>\u201cYes, please. This will just take a minute once everything is set.\u201d Concentration is evident in Stephen\u2019s tone, as though he is holding something in place until Tony is ready.</p><p>Tony moves his head back to the front cautiously, not sure what Stephen is doing, but certain it is complicated, going by the doctor\u2019s tone. The hum continues, reminding him of high-voltage transformers, or the giant arc-reactor he used to have on display so many years ago. His back feels twitchy and he can sense actual energy, like heat but not hot, coming off of whatever Stephen had started back there. Once his head is back in position, he hears more of the snap and hum behind him. </p><p>\u201cAlright, everything is set up and ready. This is going to be strange and maybe a bit like touching an electric fence, but you\u2019ll start to feel better once it\u2019s done.\u201d Behind him, Stephen manages to sound confident and cautious, the susurration of cloth underlying the murmur of his voice. \u201cMay I proceed?\u201d</p><p>Tony chuckles to himself a bit at Stephen describing something as strange. Increasing in pitch, the hum of whatever is behind him gives him pause, causing him to evaluate how much he trusts the man that is creating this buzz of energy. It\u2019s as though his bones are beginning to vibrate at the same frequency of the hum, charging his senses and fueling his anticipation. An odd desire ignites in his chest, even as the arc reactor there starts to hum as well. Resisting the urge to bounce or move in anyway, Tony gives a quick, sharp nod.</p><p>A sharply exhaled vocalization comes from Stephen, similar to that used by martial artists when performing strength moves. Energy hits Tony in the back, a framework connecting points of himself as though wires had been strung between them. Shoulder to chest, chest to loins, knees to feet and back up through his spine to his head. At his forehead, light blossoms, turning the room an unknown degree, like it had been spun on an axis and he is trying to view it as it spins. His hands float up, palms filling with light as well, reminding him of repulsors, though he has no armor, no suit around him. </p><p>He glances down as his feet begin to feel the same, laughing as he sees the floor falling slowly away from his body. The hum encompasses him now, buzzing throughout his entirety, filling him with light, lifting him from the floor. A thought that he wants to see Stephen\u2019s face at this sight is conceived and acted upon without a break between, his physical being turning around to face the man behind him. For a moment, the room spins beyond what he can see with his eyes, yet he doesn\u2019t lose track of what he is seeing. It bounds back, rebounding back and forth until he thinks that it needs to stop, so it does. He knows he is grinning as he floats there, holding the framework in his thoughts, sure that it wasn\u2019t supposed to last this long but unwilling to let it go, to let this feeling go. </p><p>The look of awe on Stephen\u2019s face is wonderous, filling Tony\u2019s chest with an emotion he hasn\u2019t been privy to very often, one that he is reluctant to admit he can feel. Instead, he winks and grins as Stephen holds out his hands, beckoning him to let go of the energy and return to physical existence. Tony doesn\u2019t want to, but years of self-monitoring and biofeedback tells him his heart is racing. Thinking of it allows him to hear his pulse, the rush of blood surging through his veins, the actual beat of his heart, damaged though it is, strong and steady. </p><p>Threads of gold and white in that area of his body attract his attention and he sees how some of them are tangled and knotted, causing slight irregularities in the rhythm of the heart muscle. He starts to move closer but is interrupted by Stephen\u2019s voice calling to him, asking him to return, reminding him that he should be focusing on the whole, not individual pieces. Withdrawing his focus, Tony returns to looking at Stephen looking at him. His grin returning, his entire being relaxed and energized, he lets go of the energy framework and thumps gently back to the floor. </p><p>Stephen\u2019s mouth hangs open for a couple of seconds before he closes it with a click, swallowing hard to clear his throat so he can speak. He has performed this cleansing several times since he learned the incantations for it, but in the time that has passed since it was first shown to him, he has never seen anyone not already an adept take control of the healing energy in this manner. He\u2019s also never felt this way when someone has looked at him before, whether or not they were encased in illuminating energy. The experience has rendered him speechless. </p><p>From the first time he\u2019d met Tony, in his foyer after convincing him to step through the portal in the park that fateful day, Stephen could feel the energy bleeding from him. It charged the air between them, starting with snippets and jabs at each other, changing to something better the moment Tony had stepped out in front of the four of them to face down Thanos\u2019s minion without hesitation. The smile he\u2019d received after winking at Tony had sent his heart flipping out of control. It had the heady feeling of jumping from the top of a cliff, sure you can fly but weightless and freefalling until the moment your method of descent control kicks in. </p><p>Now, doing what he can to help Tony return to the health and strength he hasn\u2019t enjoyed in many years, Stephen finds that yet again, he is surprised and left in freefall, trying to catch up, a sensation that only this man in front of him has given him. Holding out his hands, he holds back the emotions that are running rampant through him, not sure that he is ready to share them or that Tony feels the same way. So much has happened and now that things are getting back to normal, he hesitates to impose. After all, Tony is still engaged to someone else. </p><p>\u201cAre you alright? That was quite the feat.\u201d Stephen somehow manages to keep his voice smooth and even, despite how unsteady he is inside. </p><p>\u201cI feel fabulous!\u201d Tony gives Stephen\u2019s hands a light squeeze, glad to have something to hold onto. Bouncing in place now that he no longer has to hold still, he grins yet again at Stephen, overjoyed with everything right now. When Stephen grins back and winks at him, he almost jumps to hug him, then holds back, not sure how that would be received. </p><p>Staring into each other\u2019s eyes, they lose track of time, seconds passing by without notice, until they do and step back so quickly it\u2019s nearly a jump, each regretting the breaking of the moment\u2019s lucid silence, yet afraid to be caught in the act. Fear is the killer of such moments, one or the other worrying, thinking too much, concerned over the reaction of people that aren\u2019t even around to judge. The shuffling of feet and clearing of throats cover the unexpected burst of affections brought out by the connection they have established between them. </p><p>Tony, used to being caught out in the open, to hiding his true self behind meaningless banter, is the first to speak. \u201cSo, how many bedrooms does this place have? Care to give me a tour? I\u2019ve been dying to see the rest of the place\u2026\u201d</p><p>His words trail off, the usual meaningless banter not so meaningless now, not after what has happened so very recently. Too recent to not have more weight than intended. </p><p>Stephen wants to make light of that phrase, joke about coming back just for that reason, but he is still too stunned from what Tony did with the healing spell for the words to fall so easily from his mouth. Mostly it\u2019s the fear that something inappropriate to the moment will fall out instead. He settles for a wry smile, one side of his face twisting upward while the other half holds back the urge to step closer, get closer, up into personal space that hasn\u2019t been opened for him yet. The signs are there, it wouldn\u2019t be unwelcome, but there\u2019s a difference between not unwelcome and invited, as much as there is between no reason not to and every reason to wait. </p><p>Seeing that wry smile sit on Stephen\u2019s face, Tony gets the implication of words held back and knows, implicitly, deep down in those parts of him that he thought had drowned long ago, that this is his show. His call, his move, his dance to lead. The tension now is so thick he can feel it, invisible but burning as hot as anything he\u2019s ever experienced stretching taut between them. Power of this magnitude is heady, light on oxygen, heavy on the chemicals that will send one into a frenzy of overdosed delight. With precision born of hours of delicate manipulations building things that are just as deadly if not as mutable as flesh, Tony pulls away from the moment, stretching those strings ever so carefully, not wanting any of them broken, to find neutral ground where he and Stephen can come to a point they dare step off together. </p><p>They end up on the couch, fretting and shifting until they are settled and situated so that neither of them are any farther or closer together than what could be construed as anything more than two good friends, meeting after a long time apart. Facing each other, bodies turned just enough to ensure they can look at each other and resting their arms along the back of the couch, they sit in constrained silence for long seconds, waiting for words to show up and be spoken. Again gazes meet, taking in the view of the other, marking the lines and angles of the one they are watching, learning the tilt of a head, the curve of tiny smiles, wrinkles around the eyes.</p><p>Tony is the one to break the silence, remembering how Stephen deferred to him during the healing spell, how he allowed Tony to take the reins and hold the energy, a sign of trust built along previously laid foundations. Since the wink while they faced down that goon of Thanos\u2019s. </p><p>\u201cI suppose we should talk about why I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>Stephen\u2019s gaze lowers, his hands coming together to pick at some imagined flaw on a nail as he contemplates some point found on the couch cushion between them. \u201cYes, that\u2019s as good a place to start as any.\u201d</p><p>Tony fully understands the caution he hears in the other man\u2019s tone, and is grateful for it. A sensation of edging out onto the frozen surface of a lake that is deeper than can be imagined forms in his mind and is hard to shake off. The song he\u2019d been humming/singing earlier comes back to him, the words of the second verse hitting a line drive straight through his thoughts.</p><p><i>I wonder what tomorrow has in mind for me<br>Or am I even in it\u2019s mind at all<br>Perhaps I\u2019ll get a chance to look ahead and see<br>Soon as I find myself a crystal ball<br>Soon as I find myself a crystal ball</i></p><p>\u201cYou have a nice singing voice.\u201d </p><p>Stephen\u2019s comment brings Tony back from wherever it is that his mind had wandered off to. It also tells him that he\u2019d been singing those lyrics out loud, not just inside his head. His cheeks heated now, he ducks his head, finding his gaze drawn by those fingers of Stephen\u2019s once again. This time they are casually folded together, laying in the juncture where Stephen\u2019s raised leg crosses under the one still braced on the floor. Before he can stop himself with too many thoughts, Tony reaches out and takes one of them in his own hands, cupping it gently, his fingers curling around the crooked and scarred flesh. The contact helps him feel grounded again, able to focus on what he wants to say.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Stephen,\u201d Tony says his name to get him to look up. When he does, Tony squeezes the hand in his grip again and continues. \u201cI am not sure how to say what is on my mind. Ever since\u2026since we\u2019ve, since we returned, I can\u2019t go back to, to how, to the way, I just can\u2019t\u2026\u201d</p><p>Stuttering the words out, forcing them off of his tongue until they finally come to a stop, Tony drops his gaze, defeated by his own inability to voice his deepest thoughts aloud. He slumps against the couch back, eyesight blurry as he grips those cool, slender fingers, fighting back tears of shame and dejection.</p><p>\u201cHey, it\u2019s okay,\u201d comes to him soft and low, mere whispers of comfort as Stephen\u2019s free hand covers his own, wrapping them both in a soft clasp. They stretch out over the intervening distance, hands wrapped together for moments stretching out without any measured increments. A gentle tug on his hands invites Tony to look up once again to see Stephen, his arms now outstretched, inviting him in for a hug. Aching to be held, to be needed and comforted all at once, Tony leans forward until he is up on his knees and heading for Stephen\u2019s embrace.</p><p>Somehow, Tony manages to get his arms around Stephen\u2019s waist as the doctor\u2019s arms wrap around his shoulders, pulling him up and snugging him close until they are fitted together in every curve and angle of their bodies. Tony\u2019s head rests against Stephen\u2019s chest, heart beat in his ear, susurration of breath a barely heard whisper. </p><p>\u201cMy arc reactor\u2019s not -?\u201d Tony murmurs against the blue robe, breathing deeply of the herbal and faintly burnt smell of the folded cloth.</p><p>\u201cNo, not in the least. You\u2019re fine right where you are.\u201d </p><p>Stephen\u2019s breath stirs the hairs on Tony\u2019s head, a soothing sensation that\u2019s only faintly sensual at this moment. Those long, slender fingers rub and massage Tony\u2019s rib muscles, down as far as they can reach and back up again, across the shoulders and down the spine. Thinking how right he was about the hands now touching him, he floats, at peace, until he sleeps. </p><p><b>Part 2 coming soon!</b></p><p style=\"\">\n\n<b>Comments <a href=\"https://gramaeryebard.tumblr.com/ask\">Welcome</a>!</b>\n\n<br></p><p><b>Tagging is open!<br></b></p><p><b>Fair warning - if you like my stuff more than once, I\u2019ll probably tag you! ^_^</b></p><p><b>Tags:</b></p><p><b>My Beta:</b> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m09OV521hCz-_Vvp1GjM34Q\">@otakustarchild</a>/<a href=\"https://psylentpoet.tumblr.com/\">@psylentpoet</a> </p><p><b>My Inspirations: </b>\u00a0<a href=\"https://cassiopeiassky.tumblr.com/\">@cassiopeiassky</a>; <a href=\"http://imagine-assembling-the-avengers.tumblr.com/\">@imagine-assembling-the-avengers</a>; </p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjecWmCvTeKd6zPRNYcQmzA\">@thinkwritexpress-official</a>; <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mnk536uY7frXwxG1tfiZclg\">@meganlpie</a>; <a href=\"http://captainrogerss.tumblr.com/post/171800009268\">@captainrogerss</a>; <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mvAB49XSMQcS3XR1XSl7yXA\">@rcmclachlan</a>; </p><p><a href=\"https://bitsandbobsandstuff.tumblr.com/\">@bitsandbobsandstuff</a>\u200b\u200b; \u00a0<a href=\"http://jrubalcaba.tumblr.com/\">@jrubalcaba</a>\u200b; \u00a0<a href=\"https://suz-123.tumblr.com/\">@suz-123</a>\u200b; <a href=\"https://tilltheendwilliwrite.tumblr.com/\">@tilltheendwilliwrite</a>; \u00a0</p><p><b>Requested and the usual suspects:</b> \u00a0<a href=\"https://capsheadquaters.tumblr.com/\">@capsheadquaters</a>; <a href=\"https://sebbytrash.tumblr.com/\">@sebbytrash</a>; <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYRPZrzgKmqk6hqZLPP07Sw\">@caplansteverogers</a>; \u00a0</p><p><a href=\"https://capandbuck.tumblr.com/\">@capandbuck</a>; <a href=\"https://wehaveabucky.tumblr.com/\">@wehaveabucky</a>; @the-shield-of-infinity-writing</p><p><a href=\"https://swanky-batman.tumblr.com/\">@swanky-batman</a>; \u00a0\u200b<a href=\"https://storyteller-le.tumblr.com/\">@storyteller-le</a>; <a href=\"https://coffee-and-mary-jane.tumblr.com/\">@coffee-and-mary-jane</a>; <a href=\"https://ficstoreadandrec.tumblr.com/\">@ficstoreadandrec</a>; <a href=\"https://vandread1989.tumblr.com/\">@vandread1989</a>; </p><p><a href=\"https://steve-rogers-personal-hell.tumblr.com/\">@steve-rogers-personal-hell\u200b</a>; <a href=\"https://101killer.tumblr.com/\">@101killer</a>; <a href=\"http://deliriousinferno.tumblr.com/\">@deliriousinferno</a>; \u00a0<a href=\"http://bionic-buckyb.tumblr.com/post/171881017295\">@bionic-buckyb\u200b\u200b</a>; <a href=\"https://whiskeyandmarvel.tumblr.com/\">@whiskeyandmarvel</a>; \u00a0</p><p><a href=\"https://amandarosemire.tumblr.com/\">@amandarosemire</a>; @<a href=\"https://until-theend-oftheline.tumblr.com/\">until-thend-oftheline</a>; <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mb9kA4SjGTbzW6XcdqbTvJQ\">@fosteringmermaids</a>; <a href=\"http://sebbystanxbuckybarnes.tumblr.com/\">@sebbystanxbuckybarnes</a></p><p><a href=\"https://aflashfan.tumblr.com/\">@aflashfan</a>; <a href=\"https://marvel-ash.tumblr.com/\">@marvel-ash</a>; <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJMZIYfYDu01BG_CqBel1ew\">@mo320</a>; <a href=\"http://all-around-geek.tumblr.com/\">@all-around-geek</a>; <a href=\"https://bojabee.tumblr.com/\">@bojabee</a>; <a href=\"https://cassiopeia-barrow.tumblr.com/\">@cassiopeia-barrow</a>; </p><p><a href=\"https://marvelfansworld.tumblr.com/\">@marvelfansworld\u200b</a>; <a href=\"https://ihaveamonsterinme.tumblr.com/\">@ihaveamonsterinme</a>; <a href=\"https://unofferable-fic.tumblr.com/\">@unofferable-fic</a>; <a href=\"https://psychoticobsession.tumblr.com/\">@psychoticobsession</a>; \u00a0</p><p> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mtaWbbBGZkg3ZgGEOAXx5ow\">@whothehellisbella</a>; \u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mwMoWhyE37A1BpH9e0rCf0Q\">@ddetraque</a>; <a href=\"https://hoechlin22.tumblr.com/\">@hoechlin22</a>; <a href=\"http://afperfect.tumblr.com/\">@afperfect</a>; <a href=\"http://agarcehasnoname.tumblr.com/\">@agarcehasnoname</a>; </p><p><a href=\"https://loratadina-makesmewanttocry.tumblr.com/\">@loratadina-makesmewanttocry</a>; <a href=\"https://bookfrog242.tumblr.com/\">@bookfrog242</a>; <a href=\"https://toaster-strudel-witch.tumblr.com/\">@toaster-strudel-witch</a>; </p><p><b>Winter Driving tags:</b></p><p><a href=\"https://chook007.tumblr.com/\">@chook007</a>; \u00a0<a href=\"https://capandbuck.tumblr.com/\">@capandbuck</a>; <a href=\"http://ghostssss.tumblr.com/\">@ghostssss</a>; <a href=\"http://imabitch-getoverit.tumblr.com/\">@imabitch-getoverit</a>; <a href=\"https://breezy1415.tumblr.com/\">@breezy1415</a>; </p><p><a href=\"https://marvelrevival.tumblr.com/\">@marvelrevival</a>; <a href=\"https://notimetoblog.tumblr.com/\">@notimetoblog</a>; <a href=\"https://ghostofanassassin.tumblr.com/\">@ghostofanassassin</a>; </p><p>If anyone wants to be tagged/untagged, let me know, k.</p>",

Lost in thought, he takes no interest in his surroundings until his feet stop at one particular set of stairs. They aren&rsquo;t imposing, being only two steps between door and sidewalk. Three if he counts the top one. The area between the stair and door isn&rsquo;t imposing either, a few steps and he&rsquo;s there. He studied the door, noting how ordinary and typical it is. There&rsquo;s two of them, to be precise, and when has he not been precise?</p><p>He considers knocking, though he doesn&rsquo;t want to be a bother to anyone. Which is why he went for a walk in the first place. A note had been left behind, on his work bench, letting anyone who cared to read it that he is going to the city for a few days off. It&rsquo;s not like he didn&rsquo;t deserve it. By his calculations, he could go on vacation for the rest of his life and not use up all his time, if he worked a regular job. Which he didn&rsquo;t.</p><p>It baffles him why he&rsquo;s here, at this door, right now. At least, that&rsquo;s what he tells himself. Like he doesn&rsquo;t know why he came this way. Nothing else makes sense. That, above all else, is what brings him here. He doesn&rsquo;t know where else he could go. Nobody he knows understands the dilemma he is facing. So he stands here, at this door, wondering if this is also a mistake.</p><p>The door opens, on its own, revealing the man he&rsquo;s come to see. To talk to, hopefully. Dr Strange stands there, a faint smile softening the edges of his face.</p><p>&ldquo;Namaste, Tony Stark. I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;ve come by for a visit.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So you knew I was coming for a visit?&rdquo; Tony can&rsquo;t help but sound skeptical. </p><p>The faint smile bursts into its full radiance, lightening Strange&rsquo;s countenance immensely. &ldquo;Not exactly, but the probabilities were highest for this morning. Please,&rdquo; he steps back from the doorway, motioning inward, &ldquo;come inside.&rdquo;</p><p>Shedding his reluctance, Tony steps through the door, hands in his pockets. He glances around, noting that Strange is wearing that blue robe that seems to be his outfit of choice when working his magic. The foyer had been repaired, something Tony had seen to, despite the doctor&rsquo;s protest. No one else was here, judging by the silence of the house. Strange heads toward the back of the house, bypassing the stairs.</p><p>&ldquo;What brings you here today, Tony? May I call you Tony?&rdquo; Strange turns his head as they walk, tossing the questions over his shoulder.</p><p>Tony shrugs. &ldquo;I prefer that, actually. Especially when I&rsquo;m being friendly.&rdquo;</p><p>He stops at the end of the hallway, hands still in his pockets. Head tipping sideways, he stares out over the display floor, not seeing any of the items contained there, his mind searching for an answer to the first question. After several seconds of not finding one, his gaze lowers to the floor, focusing on his shoes. A pair of boots come into view, followed by a hand on his shoulder.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay to say you don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; Strange&rsquo;s voice soothes him, settling over him, blanketing him unexpectedly in comfort. He releases his grip on Tony&rsquo;s shoulder and turns back the way he&rsquo;d been heading. &ldquo;Perhaps we can figure something out while you&rsquo;re here.&rdquo;</p><p>Following slowly behind, Tony starts humming the tune that pops into his head. After the opening bars and first two verses, he begins singing, softly, barely breathing the words of the chorus. </p><p><i>Tell me, tell me where I&rsquo;m going<br />I don&rsquo;t know where I&rsquo;ve been<br />Tell me, tell me, won&rsquo;t you tell me<br />And then tell me again<br />My heart is breaking, my body&rsquo;s aching<br />And I don&rsquo;t know where to go<br />Tell me, tell me, won&rsquo;t you tell me<br />I&rsquo;ve just got to know</i></p><p>&ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSuQbF9suqA\">Crystal Ball</a>. Styx. 1976 from the album of the same name. Released again on the Caught in the Act album, 1984. And again in 1997 on the Return to Paradise album. One of Tommy Shaw&rsquo;s best songs, ever. In my opinion.&rdquo; Strange returns to Tony&rsquo;s side with a mug of something steaming in each hand and gives one to Tony with a smug little grin. Tony recognizes that grin. It&rsquo;s the same as the one that he gets when he is showing off. It&rsquo;s been a long time since he&rsquo;s had a reason to use it.</p><p>&ldquo;Wow, you&rsquo;re kidding me. Now that&rsquo;s impressive.&rdquo; Tony hasn&rsquo;t had anyone show off for him in a long time, either. He takes the drink, noting that the mug is cool, even while the liquid steams within it. Magic, he supposes, taking a drink as he thinks of a couple different ways that could be made to happen with technology. Not that he&rsquo;d ever have a chance to make a device to do that. His inner scoffing gets interrupted by the taste of whatever is in this cup. </p><p>&ldquo;This is amazing! What is it?&rdquo; He turns to find Strange, the doctor having stepped out of view again, leaving Tony standing in the middle of an area whose boundaries are defined by a couple of leather couches and a high wooden desk covered in books and papers that appear to be antiques, or at least old and handmade. He wonders if he should call the man Dr Strange, though that feels so formal at this point. </p><p>&ldquo;Call me Stephen. I think we are on good enough terms for that, don&rsquo;t you, Tony?&rdquo; Stephen has walked up behind him and is staring at his back. Or he was, as Tony spins around to find him standing there, chin in hand, elbow on wrist, concerned look on his face, eyes focused where Tony&rsquo;s spine had been a few seconds ago. </p><p>&ldquo;And, it&rsquo;s just tea, with a little honey. A special blend I put together to help with anxiety and nerves. Don&rsquo;t worry. I drink it all the time.&rdquo; He waves his hand, smiling as Tony&rsquo;s mug fills back up with the steaming liquid. &ldquo;When was the last time you visited a doctor about your insomnia and anxiety?&rdquo;</p><p>Tony nearly spit his tea over the front of Stephen&rsquo;s blue robe. As it is, he chokes a couple of times on the drops of liquid that have gotten caught in his windpipe, sucking in air and coughing it out as Stephen pats his back. One last time, he coughs and then his lungs are clear, though his head is spinning now, from the influx of oxygen and from the concern in Stephen&rsquo;s voice. Like that smug little grin, Tony isn&rsquo;t sure when the last time he&rsquo;d had that question asked of him. He forgets that Strange, no-no, Stephen, is actually a doctor. The magic, among other things, had distracted him from that fact.</p><p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t been vetted by a medical doctor for more than scratches and bruises in, oh,&rdquo; pausing to think back, Tony is interrupted by Stephen shaking his head.</p><p>&ldquo;That is entirely too long and unacceptable. May I take a look?&rdquo; He holds out his hands for Tony to give his shirt up, only to see the confused look on the genius&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;Your shirt please, Tony. I&rsquo;d like to -&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Examine me? Play doctor with me?&rdquo; Tony hands over his mug and allows a mischievous grin to play across his lips as he starts to unzip his running jacket a little at a time, shaking his hips to each side as he starts to make snare drum sounds. &nbsp;To his surprise, Stephen sets the mug on the nearby desk and stands there, hands on hips, tossing his head back in laughter.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh this ought to be interesting. Maybe I should ask you to take it all off, if you&rsquo;re going to give me a show?&rdquo; His grin is full, accompanied by raised eyebrows as he watches Tony get to the bottom of the zipper and pull open one side of the jacket, showing his still-clothed shoulder. </p><p>Tony gives his shoulder a little wiggle, blowing a kiss toward Stephen. &ldquo;You okay with this, doc?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well you could do it a little faster, but if this gets your shirt off, then I&rsquo;m fine. I&rsquo;ll try to stay professional for the exam, then we can talk about personal preferences later. Say, over dinner?&rdquo; </p><p>The one eyebrow that remains raised tells Tony that the man really is seriously asking him out, right now, even as Tony is undressing for him. Heat flashes through him, head to loins, leaving him flustered and caught off-guard. He stops dancing and pulls the jacket off, giving the doctor a sassy grin, though his eyelids flutter down as he finds himself unable to look Stephen in the eye at this moment. The jacket lands on the couch with his toss, followed by the shirt. Tony resists the urge to flex, though he does tighten his stomach muscles a little.</p><p>A low whistle comes from Stephen&rsquo;s pursed lips as he views Tony&rsquo;s upper body, from his sculpted abs up to the cut pecs and deltoids. Every part of the man&rsquo;s torso is defined and toned. Stephen had figured that managing the flexibility and movement of the Iron Man suit would keep Tony in shape, but it definitely looks like the man has done more on his own beyond the strictly necessary maintenance. Besides showing appreciation, he really likes how the red of Tony&rsquo;s cheeks looks against his tan skin and the sultry smile that is being held back but still curves those lips. </p><p>Raising his gaze, Tony finds himself being appraised very frankly, both professionally and with personal interest. He&rsquo;s certain this is what a specimen on display must feel like, though with Stephen, he has a brief moment of confusion, experiencing both attraction and shyness toward his examiner. </p><p>His attraction to the man has been in him since their first meeting, standing in the foyer of this house, discussing Infinity Stones and flavors of ice cream. The fact that Stephen had known the flavor Ben and Jerry&rsquo;s had named after him, but then gave it a less than stellar review in only a few words, had lit the fire. Now, after everything they&rsquo;d been through, Tony almost can&rsquo;t believe that the attraction is reciprocated. He&rsquo;d been sure they&rsquo;d become friends, albeit reluctantly on Stephen&rsquo;s part, but finding out that it&rsquo;s more than just intellectual is exciting, and daunting. This sudden rush of nerves can only be from Tony&rsquo;s desire to not mess things up. </p><p>&ldquo;May I?&rdquo; Stephen&rsquo;s request interrupts Tony&rsquo;s inner monologue as the doctor steps closer. </p><p>Tony notices the red cloak has removed itself from Stephen&rsquo;s shoulders and taken up a position behind the couch, hanging there like a watchful butler. An unexpected memory of Jarvis hits him out of the blue, bringing a sniff to him against the briefest whiff of nostalgia.</p><p>&ldquo;Sure thing, Doc. Just tell me what you want me to do.&rdquo; Tony replies, catching a brief smirk as Stephen walks around him and again takes up a position behind him. </p><p>&ldquo;For right now,&rdquo; Stephen&rsquo;s words are slow, drawn out as though he is concentrating on something other than speaking, &ldquo;I just need you to remain still and relaxed. You can talk, if you like.&rdquo;</p><p>Hooking his thumb in the waistband of his pants, Tony realizes he doesn&rsquo;t feel the urge to talk, to fill the empty spaces, like he usually does. He&rsquo;s got a weird itch between his shoulder blades, though Stephen hasn&rsquo;t lain a finger on him yet, to his dismay. He wants to have those hands on him, touching him. His imagination has been telling him how gentle and unobtrusive that touch would be, but for now, he has to settle for eyes only. Words do come to mind after a couple of minutes of silence. </p><p>&ldquo;Well, Doc, what&rsquo;s the prognosis? Is it fatal?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Life is always fatal, if not deadly, Tony.&rdquo; Low and rumbly, Stephen&rsquo;s words are tinged with a bit of laughter that brings an answering smile to Tony&rsquo;s lips. He&rsquo;s about to respond when Stephen continues. &ldquo;You are in remarkably good condition, physically. Your aura is a mess, and your chakra points need cleansed, which I can do for you, no problem. The worst is your spinal column. With these compression fractures and pinched nerves, it&rsquo;s a wonder you&rsquo;re not in more pain than you are. Your endorphin level is through the roof, and your serotonin production is out of whack, as are your lymphatic and endocrine systems. Explains the insomnia and a lot of the anxiety.&rdquo;</p><p>Thrown off by Stephen&rsquo;s reference to chakra points and endocrine systems, along with everything else he&rsquo;d said, all jumbled together and delivered in the tone he&rsquo;d expect to hear from an auto mechanic, Tony remains silent. He resists the urge to watch as Stephen walks around him, mumbling words in languages he doesn&rsquo;t understand. When Stephen comes to a stop behind him, Tony takes a deep breath, expecting to be poked and prodded like any other doctor would. Instead, hearing a low hum start up, he tries to turn his head to see what is happening.</p><p>&ldquo;Tssss, hold still please.&rdquo; Stephen&rsquo;s near-whisper of a request stops his head mid-turn. </p><p>&ldquo;Can I straighten my head back?&rdquo; Tony murmurs the question from the side of his mouth, his neck muscles protesting the odd angle.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, please. This will just take a minute once everything is set.&rdquo; Concentration is evident in Stephen&rsquo;s tone, as though he is holding something in place until Tony is ready.</p><p>Tony moves his head back to the front cautiously, not sure what Stephen is doing, but certain it is complicated, going by the doctor&rsquo;s tone. The hum continues, reminding him of high-voltage transformers, or the giant arc-reactor he used to have on display so many years ago. His back feels twitchy and he can sense actual energy, like heat but not hot, coming off of whatever Stephen had started back there. Once his head is back in position, he hears more of the snap and hum behind him. </p><p>&ldquo;Alright, everything is set up and ready. This is going to be strange and maybe a bit like touching an electric fence, but you&rsquo;ll start to feel better once it&rsquo;s done.&rdquo; Behind him, Stephen manages to sound confident and cautious, the susurration of cloth underlying the murmur of his voice. &ldquo;May I proceed?&rdquo;</p><p>Tony chuckles to himself a bit at Stephen describing something as strange. Increasing in pitch, the hum of whatever is behind him gives him pause, causing him to evaluate how much he trusts the man that is creating this buzz of energy. It&rsquo;s as though his bones are beginning to vibrate at the same frequency of the hum, charging his senses and fueling his anticipation. An odd desire ignites in his chest, even as the arc reactor there starts to hum as well. Resisting the urge to bounce or move in anyway, Tony gives a quick, sharp nod.</p><p>A sharply exhaled vocalization comes from Stephen, similar to that used by martial artists when performing strength moves. Energy hits Tony in the back, a framework connecting points of himself as though wires had been strung between them. Shoulder to chest, chest to loins, knees to feet and back up through his spine to his head. At his forehead, light blossoms, turning the room an unknown degree, like it had been spun on an axis and he is trying to view it as it spins. His hands float up, palms filling with light as well, reminding him of repulsors, though he has no armor, no suit around him. </p><p>He glances down as his feet begin to feel the same, laughing as he sees the floor falling slowly away from his body. The hum encompasses him now, buzzing throughout his entirety, filling him with light, lifting him from the floor. A thought that he wants to see Stephen&rsquo;s face at this sight is conceived and acted upon without a break between, his physical being turning around to face the man behind him. For a moment, the room spins beyond what he can see with his eyes, yet he doesn&rsquo;t lose track of what he is seeing. It bounds back, rebounding back and forth until he thinks that it needs to stop, so it does. He knows he is grinning as he floats there, holding the framework in his thoughts, sure that it wasn&rsquo;t supposed to last this long but unwilling to let it go, to let this feeling go. </p><p>The look of awe on Stephen&rsquo;s face is wonderous, filling Tony&rsquo;s chest with an emotion he hasn&rsquo;t been privy to very often, one that he is reluctant to admit he can feel. Instead, he winks and grins as Stephen holds out his hands, beckoning him to let go of the energy and return to physical existence. Tony doesn&rsquo;t want to, but years of self-monitoring and biofeedback tells him his heart is racing. Thinking of it allows him to hear his pulse, the rush of blood surging through his veins, the actual beat of his heart, damaged though it is, strong and steady. </p><p>Threads of gold and white in that area of his body attract his attention and he sees how some of them are tangled and knotted, causing slight irregularities in the rhythm of the heart muscle. He starts to move closer but is interrupted by Stephen&rsquo;s voice calling to him, asking him to return, reminding him that he should be focusing on the whole, not individual pieces. Withdrawing his focus, Tony returns to looking at Stephen looking at him. His grin returning, his entire being relaxed and energized, he lets go of the energy framework and thumps gently back to the floor. </p><p>Stephen&rsquo;s mouth hangs open for a couple of seconds before he closes it with a click, swallowing hard to clear his throat so he can speak. He has performed this cleansing several times since he learned the incantations for it, but in the time that has passed since it was first shown to him, he has never seen anyone not already an adept take control of the healing energy in this manner. He&rsquo;s also never felt this way when someone has looked at him before, whether or not they were encased in illuminating energy. The experience has rendered him speechless. </p><p>From the first time he&rsquo;d met Tony, in his foyer after convincing him to step through the portal in the park that fateful day, Stephen could feel the energy bleeding from him. It charged the air between them, starting with snippets and jabs at each other, changing to something better the moment Tony had stepped out in front of the four of them to face down Thanos&rsquo;s minion without hesitation. The smile he&rsquo;d received after winking at Tony had sent his heart flipping out of control. It had the heady feeling of jumping from the top of a cliff, sure you can fly but weightless and freefalling until the moment your method of descent control kicks in. </p><p>Now, doing what he can to help Tony return to the health and strength he hasn&rsquo;t enjoyed in many years, Stephen finds that yet again, he is surprised and left in freefall, trying to catch up, a sensation that only this man in front of him has given him. Holding out his hands, he holds back the emotions that are running rampant through him, not sure that he is ready to share them or that Tony feels the same way. So much has happened and now that things are getting back to normal, he hesitates to impose. After all, Tony is still engaged to someone else. </p><p>&ldquo;Are you alright? That was quite the feat.&rdquo; Stephen somehow manages to keep his voice smooth and even, despite how unsteady he is inside. </p><p>&ldquo;I feel fabulous!&rdquo; Tony gives Stephen&rsquo;s hands a light squeeze, glad to have something to hold onto. Bouncing in place now that he no longer has to hold still, he grins yet again at Stephen, overjoyed with everything right now. When Stephen grins back and winks at him, he almost jumps to hug him, then holds back, not sure how that would be received. </p><p>Staring into each other&rsquo;s eyes, they lose track of time, seconds passing by without notice, until they do and step back so quickly it&rsquo;s nearly a jump, each regretting the breaking of the moment&rsquo;s lucid silence, yet afraid to be caught in the act. Fear is the killer of such moments, one or the other worrying, thinking too much, concerned over the reaction of people that aren&rsquo;t even around to judge. The shuffling of feet and clearing of throats cover the unexpected burst of affections brought out by the connection they have established between them. </p><p>Tony, used to being caught out in the open, to hiding his true self behind meaningless banter, is the first to speak. &ldquo;So, how many bedrooms does this place have? Care to give me a tour? I&rsquo;ve been dying to see the rest of the place&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>His words trail off, the usual meaningless banter not so meaningless now, not after what has happened so very recently. Too recent to not have more weight than intended. </p><p>Stephen wants to make light of that phrase, joke about coming back just for that reason, but he is still too stunned from what Tony did with the healing spell for the words to fall so easily from his mouth. Mostly it&rsquo;s the fear that something inappropriate to the moment will fall out instead. He settles for a wry smile, one side of his face twisting upward while the other half holds back the urge to step closer, get closer, up into personal space that hasn&rsquo;t been opened for him yet. The signs are there, it wouldn&rsquo;t be unwelcome, but there&rsquo;s a difference between not unwelcome and invited, as much as there is between no reason not to and every reason to wait. </p><p>Seeing that wry smile sit on Stephen&rsquo;s face, Tony gets the implication of words held back and knows, implicitly, deep down in those parts of him that he thought had drowned long ago, that this is his show. His call, his move, his dance to lead. The tension now is so thick he can feel it, invisible but burning as hot as anything he&rsquo;s ever experienced stretching taut between them. Power of this magnitude is heady, light on oxygen, heavy on the chemicals that will send one into a frenzy of overdosed delight. With precision born of hours of delicate manipulations building things that are just as deadly if not as mutable as flesh, Tony pulls away from the moment, stretching those strings ever so carefully, not wanting any of them broken, to find neutral ground where he and Stephen can come to a point they dare step off together. </p><p>They end up on the couch, fretting and shifting until they are settled and situated so that neither of them are any farther or closer together than what could be construed as anything more than two good friends, meeting after a long time apart. Facing each other, bodies turned just enough to ensure they can look at each other and resting their arms along the back of the couch, they sit in constrained silence for long seconds, waiting for words to show up and be spoken. Again gazes meet, taking in the view of the other, marking the lines and angles of the one they are watching, learning the tilt of a head, the curve of tiny smiles, wrinkles around the eyes.</p><p>Tony is the one to break the silence, remembering how Stephen deferred to him during the healing spell, how he allowed Tony to take the reins and hold the energy, a sign of trust built along previously laid foundations. Since the wink while they faced down that goon of Thanos&rsquo;s. </p><p>&ldquo;I suppose we should talk about why I&rsquo;m here.&rdquo;</p><p>Stephen&rsquo;s gaze lowers, his hands coming together to pick at some imagined flaw on a nail as he contemplates some point found on the couch cushion between them. &ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s as good a place to start as any.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony fully understands the caution he hears in the other man&rsquo;s tone, and is grateful for it. A sensation of edging out onto the frozen surface of a lake that is deeper than can be imagined forms in his mind and is hard to shake off. The song he&rsquo;d been humming/singing earlier comes back to him, the words of the second verse hitting a line drive straight through his thoughts.</p><p><i>I wonder what tomorrow has in mind for me<br />Or am I even in it&rsquo;s mind at all<br />Perhaps I&rsquo;ll get a chance to look ahead and see<br />Soon as I find myself a crystal ball<br />Soon as I find myself a crystal ball</i></p><p>&ldquo;You have a nice singing voice.&rdquo; </p><p>Stephen&rsquo;s comment brings Tony back from wherever it is that his mind had wandered off to. It also tells him that he&rsquo;d been singing those lyrics out loud, not just inside his head. His cheeks heated now, he ducks his head, finding his gaze drawn by those fingers of Stephen&rsquo;s once again. This time they are casually folded together, laying in the juncture where Stephen&rsquo;s raised leg crosses under the one still braced on the floor. Before he can stop himself with too many thoughts, Tony reaches out and takes one of them in his own hands, cupping it gently, his fingers curling around the crooked and scarred flesh. The contact helps him feel grounded again, able to focus on what he wants to say.</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you, Stephen,&rdquo; Tony says his name to get him to look up. When he does, Tony squeezes the hand in his grip again and continues. &ldquo;I am not sure how to say what is on my mind. Ever since&hellip;since we&rsquo;ve, since we returned, I can&rsquo;t go back to, to how, to the way, I just can&rsquo;t&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Stuttering the words out, forcing them off of his tongue until they finally come to a stop, Tony drops his gaze, defeated by his own inability to voice his deepest thoughts aloud. He slumps against the couch back, eyesight blurry as he grips those cool, slender fingers, fighting back tears of shame and dejection.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, it&rsquo;s okay,&rdquo; comes to him soft and low, mere whispers of comfort as Stephen&rsquo;s free hand covers his own, wrapping them both in a soft clasp. They stretch out over the intervening distance, hands wrapped together for moments stretching out without any measured increments. A gentle tug on his hands invites Tony to look up once again to see Stephen, his arms now outstretched, inviting him in for a hug. Aching to be held, to be needed and comforted all at once, Tony leans forward until he is up on his knees and heading for Stephen&rsquo;s embrace.</p><p>Somehow, Tony manages to get his arms around Stephen&rsquo;s waist as the doctor&rsquo;s arms wrap around his shoulders, pulling him up and snugging him close until they are fitted together in every curve and angle of their bodies. Tony&rsquo;s head rests against Stephen&rsquo;s chest, heart beat in his ear, susurration of breath a barely heard whisper. </p><p>&ldquo;My arc reactor&rsquo;s not -?&rdquo; Tony murmurs against the blue robe, breathing deeply of the herbal and faintly burnt smell of the folded cloth.</p><p>&ldquo;No, not in the least. You&rsquo;re fine right where you are.&rdquo; </p><p>Stephen&rsquo;s breath stirs the hairs on Tony&rsquo;s head, a soothing sensation that&rsquo;s only faintly sensual at this moment. Those long, slender fingers rub and massage Tony&rsquo;s rib muscles, down as far as they can reach and back up again, across the shoulders and down the spine. Thinking how right he was about the hands now touching him, he floats, at peace, until he sleeps. </p><p><b>Part 2 coming soon!</b></p><p>\n\n<b>Comments <a href=\"https://gramaeryebard.tumblr.com/ask\">Welcome</a>!</b>\n\n<br /></p><p><b>Tagging is open!<br /></b></p><p><b>Fair warning - if you like my stuff more than once, I&rsquo;ll probably tag you! ^_^</b></p><p><b>Tags:</b></p><p><b>My Beta:</b> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m09OV521hCz-_Vvp1GjM34Q\">@otakustarchild</a>/<a href=\"https://psylentpoet.tumblr.com/\">@psylentpoet</a> </p><p><b>My Inspirations: </b>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://cassiopeiassky.tumblr.com/\">@cassiopeiassky</a>; <a href=\"http://imagine-assembling-the-avengers.tumblr.com/\">@imagine-assembling-the-avengers</a>; </p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjecWmCvTeKd6zPRNYcQmzA\">@thinkwritexpress-official</a>; <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mnk536uY7frXwxG1tfiZclg\">@meganlpie</a>; <a href=\"http://captainrogerss.tumblr.com/post/171800009268\">@captainrogerss</a>; <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mvAB49XSMQcS3XR1XSl7yXA\">@rcmclachlan</a>; </p><p><a href=\"https://bitsandbobsandstuff.tumblr.com/\">@bitsandbobsandstuff</a>&#8203;&#8203;; &nbsp;<a href=\"http://jrubalcaba.tumblr.com/\">@jrubalcaba</a>&#8203;; &nbsp;<a href=\"https://suz-123.tumblr.com/\">@suz-123</a>&#8203;; <a href=\"https://tilltheendwilliwrite.tumblr.com/\">@tilltheendwilliwrite</a>; &nbsp;</p><p><b>Requested and the usual suspects:</b> &nbsp;<a href=\"https://capsheadquaters.tumblr.com/\">@capsheadquaters</a>; <a href=\"https://sebbytrash.tumblr.com/\">@sebbytrash</a>; <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYRPZrzgKmqk6hqZLPP07Sw\">@caplansteverogers</a>; &nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://capandbuck.tumblr.com/\">@capandbuck</a>; <a href=\"https://wehaveabucky.tumblr.com/\">@wehaveabucky</a>; @the-shield-of-infinity-writing</p><p><a href=\"https://swanky-batman.tumblr.com/\">@swanky-batman</a>; &nbsp;&#8203;<a href=\"https://storyteller-le.tumblr.com/\">@storyteller-le</a>; <a href=\"https://coffee-and-mary-jane.tumblr.com/\">@coffee-and-mary-jane</a>; <a href=\"https://ficstoreadandrec.tumblr.com/\">@ficstoreadandrec</a>; <a href=\"https://vandread1989.tumblr.com/\">@vandread1989</a>; </p><p><a href=\"https://steve-rogers-personal-hell.tumblr.com/\">@steve-rogers-personal-hell&#8203;</a>; <a href=\"https://101killer.tumblr.com/\">@101killer</a>; <a href=\"http://deliriousinferno.tumblr.com/\">@deliriousinferno</a>; &nbsp;<a href=\"http://bionic-buckyb.tumblr.com/post/171881017295\">@bionic-buckyb&#8203;&#8203;</a>; <a href=\"https://whiskeyandmarvel.tumblr.com/\">@whiskeyandmarvel</a>; &nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://amandarosemire.tumblr.com/\">@amandarosemire</a>; @<a href=\"https://until-theend-oftheline.tumblr.com/\">until-thend-oftheline</a>; <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mb9kA4SjGTbzW6XcdqbTvJQ\">@fosteringmermaids</a>; <a href=\"http://sebbystanxbuckybarnes.tumblr.com/\">@sebbystanxbuckybarnes</a></p><p><a href=\"https://aflashfan.tumblr.com/\">@aflashfan</a>; <a href=\"https://marvel-ash.tumblr.com/\">@marvel-ash</a>; <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJMZIYfYDu01BG_CqBel1ew\">@mo320</a>; <a href=\"http://all-around-geek.tumblr.com/\">@all-around-geek</a>; <a href=\"https://bojabee.tumblr.com/\">@bojabee</a>; <a href=\"https://cassiopeia-barrow.tumblr.com/\">@cassiopeia-barrow</a>; </p><p><a href=\"https://marvelfansworld.tumblr.com/\">@marvelfansworld&#8203;</a>; <a href=\"https://ihaveamonsterinme.tumblr.com/\">@ihaveamonsterinme</a>; <a href=\"https://unofferable-fic.tumblr.com/\">@unofferable-fic</a>; <a href=\"https://psychoticobsession.tumblr.com/\">@psychoticobsession</a>; &nbsp;</p><p> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mtaWbbBGZkg3ZgGEOAXx5ow\">@whothehellisbella</a>; &nbsp;<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mwMoWhyE37A1BpH9e0rCf0Q\">@ddetraque</a>; <a href=\"https://hoechlin22.tumblr.com/\">@hoechlin22</a>; <a href=\"http://afperfect.tumblr.com/\">@afperfect</a>; <a href=\"http://agarcehasnoname.tumblr.com/\">@agarcehasnoname</a>; </p><p><a href=\"https://loratadina-makesmewanttocry.tumblr.com/\">@loratadina-makesmewanttocry</a>; <a href=\"https://bookfrog242.tumblr.com/\">@bookfrog242</a>; <a href=\"https://toaster-strudel-witch.tumblr.com/\">@toaster-strudel-witch</a>; </p><p><b>Winter Driving tags:</b></p><p><a href=\"https://chook007.tumblr.com/\">@chook007</a>; &nbsp;<a href=\"https://capandbuck.tumblr.com/\">@capandbuck</a>; <a href=\"http://ghostssss.tumblr.com/\">@ghostssss</a>; <a href=\"http://imabitch-getoverit.tumblr.com/\">@imabitch-getoverit</a>; <a href=\"https://breezy1415.tumblr.com/\">@breezy1415</a>; </p><p><a href=\"https://marvelrevival.tumblr.com/\">@marvelrevival</a>; <a href=\"https://notimetoblog.tumblr.com/\">@notimetoblog</a>; <a href=\"https://ghostofanassassin.tumblr.com/\">@ghostofanassassin</a>; </p><p>If anyone wants to be tagged/untagged, let me know, k.</p>",

Lost in thought, he takes no interest in his surroundings until his feet stop at one particular set of stairs. They aren&rsquo;t imposing, being only two steps between door and sidewalk. Three if he counts the top one. The area between the stair and door isn&rsquo;t imposing either, a few steps and he&rsquo;s there. He studied the door, noting how ordinary and typical it is. There&rsquo;s two of them, to be precise, and when has he not been precise?</p>\n<p>He considers knocking, though he doesn&rsquo;t want to be a bother to anyone. Which is why he went for a walk in the first place. A note had been left behind, on his work bench, letting anyone who cared to read it that he is going to the city for a few days off. It&rsquo;s not like he didn&rsquo;t deserve it. By his calculations, he could go on vacation for the rest of his life and not use up all his time, if he worked a regular job. Which he didn&rsquo;t.</p>\n<p>It baffles him why he&rsquo;s here, at this door, right now. At least, that&rsquo;s what he tells himself. Like he doesn&rsquo;t know why he came this way. Nothing else makes sense. That, above all else, is what brings him here. He doesn&rsquo;t know where else he could go. Nobody he knows understands the dilemma he is facing. So he stands here, at this door, wondering if this is also a mistake.</p>\n<p>The door opens, on its own, revealing the man he&rsquo;s come to see. To talk to, hopefully. Dr Strange stands there, a faint smile softening the edges of his face.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Namaste, Tony Stark. I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;ve come by for a visit.&rdquo;</p>\n</p>",
