                "content": "<p>I don&rsquo;t ship Jonrya but the relationship Arya and Jon share is my absolutely favourite one. I think Martin has also made a comment on the subject of the importance of Arya and Jon&rsquo;s relationship and the countless times these two think of each other (more times than any pov character thinks of another pov character) just prove how crucial this bond is to their journeys and to the story overall.</p><p>While I personally don&rsquo;t ship it romantically I think it&rsquo;s wrong that some fans label it a crack ship, especially on the books. I mean Mart&iacute;n even revealed on the 1993 letter that his original plans were for Jon and Arya to end up together and as King and Queen of Westeros -whether or not this will actually happen on the last two books remains to be seen(personally I believe that Martin changed his original plans and that a romantic relationship won&rsquo;t happen between those two).</p><p>Finally, I have to say that I love the majority of Jonrya shippers. These folks have great understanding of Jon and Arya&rsquo;s personalities and write some of the best meta about them.

But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to hold characters in the medieval inspired world of Westeros to modern standards, and I think a lot of other characters in Dany\u2019s position would have done the same thing. <b>Stannis burnt Mance Rayder alive for not bending the knee to him, but the fandom still loves Stannis.\u00a0</b></p><p>Now, let\u2019s talk about Jon. I think all of us can agree that in the modern day and age, insubordination is not just cause for execution. However, this isn\u2019t the modern age, this is a medieval fantasy world, and Jon gave Janos Slynt a chance to change his stance, which he refused to back down from. Thus, he was punished accordingly. And, in part, it was also to make an example of him. Jon needed to show that he was serious as a leader - he was not going to make idle threats. Even though Slynt begged for mercy at the end of his life, Jon followed through and cut off Slynt\u2019s head.\u00a0</p><p>We celebrated Janos Slynt\u2019s death because he was a bad person. He helped Littlefinger betray Ned Stark, leading to Ned\u2019s unjust execution. He was a literal child killer, helping to orchestrate the murders of Robert Baratheon\u2019s bastards on Joffrey\u2019s orders, and he personally killed Barra - an <i>infant</i> - just because Robert was her biological father. In the books it is also mentioned that Slynt can be bought, accepting bribes and selling positions during his time as Commander of the City Watch. Janos Slynt was, undeniably, scum of the earth.\u00a0</p><p><b>But that\u2019s not why Jon kills him. Jon kills him because he refused to accept Jon\u2019s orders and, when given an opportunity to back down, he persisted.</b></p><p>Let\u2019s compare that to Daenerys\u2019s execution of Randyll Tarly. Randyll Tarly was an absolutely horrible person. First of all, he was an abusive father to Sam simply because Sam, being kind and intelligent, did not conform to Randyll\u2019s toxic ideas of masculinity. Randyll has a deep seated hatred of the feminine, and he can\u2019t stand that Sam doesn\u2019t adhere to his idea of what a man should be.\u00a0</p><blockquote><p><i>A dozen masters-at-arms came and went at Horn Hill, trying to turn Samwell into the knight his father wanted. <b>The boy was cursed and caned, slapped and starved.</b> One man had him sleep in his chainmail to make him more martial. Another dressed him in his mother&rsquo;s clothing and paraded him through the bailey to shame him into valor. He only grew fatter and more frightened, until Lord Randyll&rsquo;s disappointment turned to anger and then to loathing. &ldquo;One time,&rdquo; Sam confided, his voice dropping from a whisper, &ldquo;two men came to the castle, warlocks from Qarth with white skin and blue lips. They slaughtered a bull aurochs and made me bathe in the hot blood, but it didn&rsquo;t make me brave as they&rsquo;d promised. I got sick and retched. Father had them scourged.&rdquo; </i>- AGoT, Jon IV<br/></p></blockquote><p>When Randyll cannot succeed in making Sam\u00a0\u201cmanly enough\u201d, he tells Sam that he has a choice: either he will join the Night\u2019s Watch, or Randyll will kill him. His own son. (Hey, Randyll gave a choice to Sam between compliance or death, and Daenerys did the same to him. Funny how karma works!) Randyll\u2019s general horribleness continues when he is incredibly misogynistic towards Brienne in AFFC.\u00a0</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cAs for you, my lady, it is said that your father is a good man. If so, I pity him. Some men are blessed with sons, some with daughters. No man deserves to be cursed with such as you.\u201d<br/>&hellip;<br/>&ldquo;Go where you want and do as you will &hellip; <b>but when you&rsquo;re raped don&rsquo;t look to me for justice. You will have earned it with your folly.</b>&rdquo;</i> - AFFC, Brienne III</p></blockquote><p>Randyll is also a xenophobe. He hates the Free Folk just because they were born on the other side of the Wall, calls Gilly a whore the first time he meets her, and in that scene with Daenerys, you know what he says?\u00a0</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cSay what you will about [Cersei], she was born in Westeros.\u201d\u00a0</i><br/></p></blockquote><p><b>SHE. WAS. BORN. HERE.</b>\u00a0That xenophobic garbage is his justification.\u00a0</p><p>Randyll is a horrible person just like Janos Slynt was, and they both deserved to die. Yes Daenerys doesn\u2019t execute Randyll for being horrible, she executes him for not obeying her, <b>but so does Jon with Janos Slynt</b>.\u00a0</p><p>Now, what about Dickon you might say? Surely Dickon did not deserve to die with his father? I\u2019ll admit, I feel bad for Dickon. He didn\u2019t seem like a cruel kid, but the thing is&hellip;<b>Dickon was also complicit in treason</b>. He and Randyll aligned themselves with the Lannisters, going against their oath sworn to House Tyrell, and were complicit in Olenna\u2019s murder. Even Tyrion says in this scene that the Tarlys\u2019 allegiances must be flexible if they were willing to do such a thing. How honorable can they really be if they\u2019re willing to betray their lords?\u00a0</p><p>The Tarlys were given the choice to bend the knee. They refused to. They were given a choice to go the Wall, and they refused. Maybe some people see Dany\u2019s actions as wrong because she chooses to execute them by dragonfire, not by beheading, but in my opinion, it doesn\u2019t matter how someone dies. It doesn\u2019t matter if you cut their head off, or burn them with dragonfire, or slay them in battle. <b>You\u2019re taking a life no matter how you choose to do it.

                "content": "<p>Rewatching GoT 7x05, specifically the scene with the Tarlys, I&rsquo;m just wondering&hellip;<b>why does Daenerys get so much hate for this when Jon did the same thing with Janos Slynt?&nbsp;</b></p><p>Obviously from a modern perspective, executing someone because they refuse to bend the knee to you is not an okay thing to do. But I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s fair to hold characters in the medieval inspired world of Westeros to modern standards, and I think a lot of other characters in Dany&rsquo;s position would have done the same thing. <b>Stannis burnt Mance Rayder alive for not bending the knee to him, but the fandom still loves Stannis.&nbsp;</b></p><p>Now, let&rsquo;s talk about Jon. I think all of us can agree that in the modern day and age, insubordination is not just cause for execution. However, this isn&rsquo;t the modern age, this is a medieval fantasy world, and Jon gave Janos Slynt a chance to change his stance, which he refused to back down from. Thus, he was punished accordingly. And, in part, it was also to make an example of him. Jon needed to show that he was serious as a leader - he was not going to make idle threats. Even though Slynt begged for mercy at the end of his life, Jon followed through and cut off Slynt&rsquo;s head.&nbsp;</p><p>We celebrated Janos Slynt&rsquo;s death because he was a bad person. He helped Littlefinger betray Ned Stark, leading to Ned&rsquo;s unjust execution. He was a literal child killer, helping to orchestrate the murders of Robert Baratheon&rsquo;s bastards on Joffrey&rsquo;s orders, and he personally killed Barra - an <i>infant</i> - just because Robert was her biological father. In the books it is also mentioned that Slynt can be bought, accepting bribes and selling positions during his time as Commander of the City Watch. Janos Slynt was, undeniably, scum of the earth.&nbsp;</p><p><b>But that&rsquo;s not why Jon kills him. Jon kills him because he refused to accept Jon&rsquo;s orders and, when given an opportunity to back down, he persisted.</b></p><p>Let&rsquo;s compare that to Daenerys&rsquo;s execution of Randyll Tarly. Randyll Tarly was an absolutely horrible person. First of all, he was an abusive father to Sam simply because Sam, being kind and intelligent, did not conform to Randyll&rsquo;s toxic ideas of masculinity. Randyll has a deep seated hatred of the feminine, and he can&rsquo;t stand that Sam doesn&rsquo;t adhere to his idea of what a man should be.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><i>A dozen masters-at-arms came and went at Horn Hill, trying to turn Samwell into the knight his father wanted. <b>The boy was cursed and caned, slapped and starved.</b> One man had him sleep in his chainmail to make him more martial. Another dressed him in his mother&rsquo;s clothing and paraded him through the bailey to shame him into valor. He only grew fatter and more frightened, until Lord Randyll&rsquo;s disappointment turned to anger and then to loathing. &ldquo;One time,&rdquo; Sam confided, his voice dropping from a whisper, &ldquo;two men came to the castle, warlocks from Qarth with white skin and blue lips. They slaughtered a bull aurochs and made me bathe in the hot blood, but it didn&rsquo;t make me brave as they&rsquo;d promised. I got sick and retched. Father had them scourged.&rdquo; </i>- AGoT, Jon IV<br /></p></blockquote><p>When Randyll cannot succeed in making Sam&nbsp;&ldquo;manly enough&rdquo;, he tells Sam that he has a choice: either he will join the Night&rsquo;s Watch, or Randyll will kill him. His own son. (Hey, Randyll gave a choice to Sam between compliance or death, and Daenerys did the same to him. Funny how karma works!) Randyll&rsquo;s general horribleness continues when he is incredibly misogynistic towards Brienne in AFFC.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;As for you, my lady, it is said that your father is a good man. If so, I pity him. Some men are blessed with sons, some with daughters. No man deserves to be cursed with such as you.&rdquo;<br />&hellip;<br />&ldquo;Go where you want and do as you will &hellip; <b>but when you&rsquo;re raped don&rsquo;t look to me for justice. You will have earned it with your folly.</b>&rdquo;</i> - AFFC, Brienne III</p></blockquote><p>Randyll is also a xenophobe. He hates the Free Folk just because they were born on the other side of the Wall, calls Gilly a whore the first time he meets her, and in that scene with Daenerys, you know what he says?&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;Say what you will about [Cersei], she was born in Westeros.&rdquo;&nbsp;</i><br /></p></blockquote><p><b>SHE.
