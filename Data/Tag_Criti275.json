        "answer": "<p>your wish for angst is valid and good</p><p>~</p><p>By all rules of logic, Fjord should be sleeping better now that they&rsquo;re on the water. Now that he can feel the waves gently rocking their ship as he drifts off. They always served to calm him before.</p><p>But the ocean isn&rsquo;t the safe place it used to be. And so Fjord dreams of drowning. He&rsquo;s sinking, his armor pulling him down instead of helping him swim like it should.</p><p>He knows this dream, and yet he can&rsquo;t help but struggle against the dark current tugging at his body, at his mind. He sinks like a stone.</p><p>But he doesn&rsquo;t reach the ocean floor. There&rsquo;s only darkness underneath. No end to the hungry depths of the creature that is the sea. That is his patron. That is Fjord himself.</p><p>He gives up eventually, drifting down, further down into the abyss. The water feels neither warm nor cold. It&rsquo;s almost as if he&rsquo;s floating. Breathing feels strange, like inhaling liquid air, but at least he&rsquo;s not drowning.</p><p>Fjord looks up and feels a chill run through his body when he realizes that he&rsquo;s too far down to even see the sunlight reflected on the surface. There&rsquo;s only black now. The void.</p><p>Briefly, Fjord wonders if this is really a dream, if he didn&rsquo;t just die in his sleep and this is the afterlife for those who die at sea - but then, finally and abruptly, an eye opens right in front of him. Yellow and massive and terrifying and&hellip; powerful.</p><p>Fjord summons his falchion without thinking. The eye stares, unblinking as always.</p><p><i>Reward</i>, the voice says inside his head.</p><p><i>Growth</i>. It almost purrs the word and Fjord knows his patron is satisfied with his work. If he only knew what exactly that work is.</p><p>&ldquo;Uh&hellip;glad I&rsquo;m meeting your expectations,&rdquo; he replies, and he doesn&rsquo;t hear his own voice, only sees the bubbles it makes. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;d still appreciate if I knew what you want me to do.&rdquo;</p><p>The eye narrows. <i>Weakness</i>.</p><p>Fjord flinches at the tone, but doesn&rsquo;t back down. &ldquo;Tell me what you want from me!&rdquo;</p><p><i>Consume</i>. Fjord nearly rolls his eyes. He got that part.</p><p>But his patron isn&rsquo;t finished. <i>Allies</i>. It sounds almost disgusted and then repeats: <i>Weakness</i>.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not true,&rdquo; Fjord protests immediately, &ldquo;We help each other.&rdquo;</p><p><i>Distractions</i>. There&rsquo;s anger now, real anger, and Fjord can feel it in the water all around. <i>Mine</i>.</p><p>He swallows. &ldquo;No.&rdquo; </p><p>And then the eye is gone. And Fjord is drowning. The water, so easy to breathe until now, is burning in his lungs as he gasps for air where there is none. He kicks wildly, instincts driving him to try for the surface but&hellip; he doesn&rsquo;t know where the surface is. But he keeps trying. And he keeps drowning.</p><p>He doesn&rsquo;t pass out. He should. He should be fucking dead by now. But he&rsquo;s not dying. Is he cursed to drown here forever, for denying his patron? </p><p>It <i>hurts</i>. </p><p>And then there&rsquo;s a voice. Heavily accented words he can&rsquo;t identify. A blow to his chest. Another. And another.</p><p>Fjord coughs. There&rsquo;s so much water. It&rsquo;s everywhere. It&rsquo;s not letting him go. It&rsquo;s dragging him down, killing him yet leaving him alive to suffer.</p><p>He&rsquo;s turned over onto his side by a pair of rough hands, and he vomits sea water all over the floor. Right. He fell asleep on deck of their ship. With Caleb reading nearby. It <i>was</i> just a dream.</p><p>For a couple moments, he can&rsquo;t do anything but lie there and tremble as he takes gasping breaths. It&rsquo;s air. Real air. His patron doesn&rsquo;t have that much power over him.</p><p>But it has more power here. Fjord scrambles to his legs. They need to get back to shore. He needs to get away from the ocean, his love, his greatest foe.</p><p>But suddenly there&rsquo;s a pair of arms wrapped around his chest to keep him from moving. Fjord growls angrily and struggles. &ldquo;Let go!&rdquo; He needed to change their course. Needed to get away.</p><p>&ldquo;Fjord!&rdquo; Caleb sounds frightened and worried, and he doesn&rsquo;t <i>understand</i>. None of them do.</p><p>&ldquo;Let me fucking go, Caleb! We need to- we need to&hellip;&rdquo; </p><p>Caleb lets go and Fjord makes it all of three shaky steps before he speaks again.</p><p>&ldquo;I <i>suggest</i> you sit down and get your bearings before you make any decisions.&rdquo;</p><p>The words sink in and, of course, Caleb is right. That sounds much more reasonable than what he was going to do.</p><p>Fjord sits down where he is and closes his eyes, taking a couple deep breaths. Still air. Ocean air nonetheless. It&rsquo;s meant to calm him, but somehow it only serves to remind him of what lies below now.</p><p>They&rsquo;re both silent for a long while. Fjord&rsquo;s thoughts slow down until he feels he&rsquo;s almost back to himself. Still a little shaky, but he knows where he is and he knows that he&rsquo;ll have to give this a little more thought. After all, his patron reached him on land just as well as here.</p><p>It&rsquo;s much later when Fjord trusts his voice enough to speak up. &ldquo;How do you do it?&rdquo;</p><p>Caleb looks up from his book and furrows his brows in silent question.</p><p>Fjord clears his throat. &ldquo;Cope. With the&hellip; the fear. The memories. The <i>panic</i>.&rdquo; He doesn&rsquo;t know what happened to Caleb, but he knows it was bad.</p><p>Caleb considers him for a moment. Then he turns to look out at the sea. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; is his quiet, earnest reply.</p><p>No. He doesn&rsquo;t look like he&rsquo;s coping.</p><p>And neither is Fjord. At least for now.</p>",
