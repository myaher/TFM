Some of these functions include memory, mood, vigilance, energy levels, reaction times and general cognitive function.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Burn fat-</strong>\u00a0Caffeine is found in almost every fat burning supplement. This is because caffeine is proven to be one of the very few natural substances that helps with fat burn. \u00a0One study revealed\u00a0that caffeine can <a href=\"http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/33/5/989.full.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">boost your metabolic rate</a>, ensuring you are maximizing your ability to burn fat.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Peace of mind-</strong>\u00a0In a recent study conducted by Harvard University in 2011, women who drank four or more cups of coffee per day had a 20% lower risk of becoming depressed . It also showed that they were\u00a053% less likely to commit suicide. Caffeine boosts your energy and can put you in a better mood.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Good source of antioxidants-</strong> Coffee is known to be the biggest source of antioxidants in the western diet. The western diet\u00a0typically consists\u00a0a lot of red meat, sugary desserts, high-fat foods, and refine grains, but coffee serves as the main source of antioxidants which makes it\u00a0one of the healthiest components of this diet.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Lower levels of hormones-</strong>\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/hsph-in-the-news/coffee-endometrial-cancer-risk/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Researchers at Harvard University</a> found that women who drank several cups of coffee per day were less likely to develop endometrial Cancer, which is found around the lining of a woman\u2019s uterus. Coffee helps reduce high levels of hormones thus the reduction of estrogen and insulin.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Helps prevent disease-</strong> Coffee also has an impact on reducing the risk of developing certain diseases like Parkinson\u2019s disease, heart failure, basal cell carcinoma, liver cancer and Type II Diabetes.
