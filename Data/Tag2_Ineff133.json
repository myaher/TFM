They really have a lot in common, after all. To make his point, Adam has every angel and demon fill out compatibility quizzes and go on a date with whoever they get matched with. But not just once. Oh no. They have to do it Five times. Five different dates in five days. Naturally, Aziraphale and Crowley have to participate as well&hellip;</p><!-- more --><p>\u201cI\nthink you\u2019ll all find you have a lot in common,\u201d Adam was saying. \u201cDeep down,\nyou\u2019re really not that different. And this will help you all meet new people!\u201d</p><p>The\ngreat host of assembled angels and demons watched him in silent horror. They\nwere gathered in Tadfield, out in a big snowy field large enough to hold them\nall, and far enough from any buildings to avoid startling any passing humans.</p><p>The\nMetatron coughed delicately. \u201cMight I ask <i>why</i>\nyou have chosen to inflict this punishment on us all?\u201d </p><p>\u201cThe\nyoung mazter iz finally zhowing an interezt in the buiznezz,\u201d said Beelzebub\nmiserably. \u201cImprezzively zadiztic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlimey.\u201d\nAdam ran a hand through his mop of curls. He was a teenager now, and it showed\nin the deepening of his voice and the way his body had started to\nfill out. He still looked like <i>Adam</i>\nthough, like the kind of boy who runs through ditches and plays with his dog\nand organizes games for his friends to play. Only bigger.</p><p>\u201cThis\nis what I mean. You\u2019re not being punished,\u201d Adam said. \u201cI just think if you spent more time getting\nto know each other, you\u2019d find you had a lot in common. It\u2019ll be good for you!\u201d</p><p>Beelzebub\nsighed. \u201cJuzt when I think your father would be pleazed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\nwhy must this be done on the Earth?\u201d asked Metatron desperately. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s\nneutral ground.\u201d Adam rubbed his nose. \u201c\u2019Sides. If you spent more time on earth\nyou might actually like it. No more Apocalypses!\u201d</p><p>There\nwere shocked murmurs and breaking out through both sides now, the angels and\ndemons watching Adam warily. He beamed back at them, satisfied and confident in\nhis teenage logic. To be fair, he hadn\u2019t failed them yet.</p><p>\u201cYes\nbut,\u201d the Metatron\u2019s face twisted up into something distasteful. \u201cDating? It\u2019s\ninsulting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t\nHeaven support love and peace?\u201d asked Adam.</p><p>\u201c<i>Love</i>, not\u2014\u201c</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t\nfinish that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMuzt\nwe really go on a\u2026<i>date</i>,\u201d said\nBeezlebub, as if he\u2019d never said the word before, \u201cwiz whoever we are matched\nwiz?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\nyeah.\u201d Adam beamed. \u201cThat\u2019s the point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMust\nwe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t\nworry! I saw them do this at school. You just fill out the quizzes and get\nmatched with someone you like. It\u2019s wicked!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen\nyou zay \u2018wicked\u2019 do you mean zinful?\u201d said Beelzebub hopefully.</p><p>\u201cNah,\nI mean it\u2019s brilliant.\u201d Beelzebub deflated. \u201cIt\u2019s great fun! And you\u2019ll all get\nto do it a couple of times so I can narrow it right down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\nmany is a couple?\u201c asked The Metatron in alarm.</p><p>\u201cI\ndunno yet. Four? Five?\u201d</p><p>The\nfield filled with worried voices, angels and demons eyeing each other and their\nopposites across from each other nervously.<br/></p><p>\u201cRight!\u201d\nAdam clapped his hands together. \u201cSo everyone pick up a quiz. You\u2019ll have until\nmidnight to fill them out, so take your time if you like. Tomorrow, you\u2019ll all go on your first date!\u201d</p><p>And\nthus ended the first official meeting of all the hosts of heaven and all the\nlegions of hell at the behest of the rebel Antichrist. Adam stood watching them\nall, disappearing back Up or Down in flashes of light, or milling about in\nshell-shocked silence. The snowy breeze rustling over the open field tossed his\nhair about gently, a solid spot of calm in a sea of uneasy.</p><p>An\nangel and a demon hurried towards him.</p><p>\u201cHullo\nyou two,\u201d said Adam brightly. \u201cIsn\u2019t it great?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr,\u201d\nbegan Aziraphale. \u201cIt\u2019s quite the plan to bring everyone together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw\nthanks! I thought it was pretty great myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\nsure ruffled them,\u201d said Crowley. \u201cJust, er\u2026everyone? Really, <i>everyone?</i>\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\nwouldn\u2019t be fair otherwise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\nmean some poor sod is going to end up with the Metatron.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr\nGabriel,\u201d added Aziraphale with a shudder.</p><p>Adam\nbeamed. \u201cThere\u2019s someone for everyone. And they all need to be more\nopen-minded. Like you chaps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\nAbout that,\u201d said Aziraphale.</p><p>\u201cWhy\ndo <i>we </i>have to do this?\u201d whined\nCrowley. \u201cWe already like earth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery\nmuch!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd\nwe\u2019ve been, y\u2019know\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cFriends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHanging\nout.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>With</i> each other,\u201d added Aziraphale.</p><p>\u201cYeah!\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor\na very long time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYears.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThousands\nof them!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince\nthe garden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh\nI know that. Trust me, I know.\u201d There was a distressingly knowing glint in Adam\u2019s\neye when he said that. Aziraphale and Crowley shuffled uncomfortably. \u201cYou two were actually my inspiration.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\nwon\u2019t make an exception or else everyone will want one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut,\u201d\nbegan Aziraphale. Then he fell silent.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s\nonly for an hour or so,\u201d said Adam kindly. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be fancy, you can just go for a cuppa. And if you don\u2019t like them you don\u2019t have\nto see them ever again. But who knows? Maybe you\u2019ll find your soul mates!\u201d</p><p>Crowley\nlent in close. \u201cBut what if you pair someone with bad blood between them? What\nif I get <i>Hastur?</i>\u201d he hissed\nnervously.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cAw,\nthat\u2019s what the quiz is for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr,\nwhat sort of a <i>quiz</i> is it?\u201d asked Aziraphale nervously, wondering if he would\nneed to brush up on his geometry. Then again, Adam was a very\u2026modern boy. Maybe\nit would be about \u2018pop culture\u2019. The angel glanced nervously at Crowley and\nshuffled closer. \u201cHow difficult is it to pass?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlimey!\nIt\u2019s not that sort of a quiz. It\u2019s asks about your <i>personality.</i> You can put your likes and dislikes and what you want\nin a date. It\u2019s bloody brilliant! Our school did it this year and that\u2019s where\nI got the idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\nI suppose\u2026that\u2019s reasonable.\u201d</p><p>Crowley\nleaned over to him. \u201cAngel, remember when I got that commendation for OkCupid?\nOnline dating?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Unfortunately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOi,\nit\u2019s made a lot of people happy too,\u201d insisted Adam.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t\nrub it in,\u201d sighed Crowley.</p><p>\u201cAnd\nif you don\u2019t like who you get, you can answer differently the next time. It\u2019ll\nbe grand. Just you wait!\u201d</p><p>xxx</p><p>Crowley\nwas sprawled across his sleek leather couch, a glass of wine on the coffee\ntable beside him. The compatibility quiz was ten pages of pink paper, fill-in-the-blanks and multiple-choice\nquestions, all bound together in a neat little booklet. Crowley ticked off\nboxes with a pen so expensive it could pay his rent for a month*.</p><p>*If\nCrowley were the sort to bother with taxes. One of the perks of being a demon\nwas unlimited cash, and credit cards that smelled faintly of sulfur when the\ntransaction when through.</p><p>\u201c\u2019About\nme\u2019,\u201d he read aloud. \u201c\u2019How would I describe myself?\u2019 Oh, you know. Cool. Fancy.\nSome might even say I\u2019m a rebel without a cause. Favourite pass-time? Oh, sin!\nSloth especially. Name a celebrity or fictional character you most relate to.\nThe name\u2019s <i>Bond</i>\u2026Hobbies, hmm, mayhem\nand mischief, naturally. A bit of plant terrorism. Tempting angels? Does that\ncount? Better put it down just in case&hellip;\u201d</p><p>Crowley\nwas having fun with this.</p><p>Having\nhad a hand in online dating, he wasn\u2019t expecting much out of\nthis. Did he respect Adam? Certainly. Was he grateful for the boy stopping the\nApocalypse in its tracks? Of course. But did that mean he would be looking to a\nteenager - no matter how occultly inclined \u2013 to match him with his soul mate?\nHell\u2014<i>somewhere,</i> no.</p><p>They\nhad to do this thing what, four, five times? He may as well have some fun with\nit. And see how well it worked, anyway.</p><p>\u201c\u2019What\ndo I want in a date?\u2019 Ooh, let me see. Cool, sleek, devil-may-care. Hah.\nFashionable of course. Expensive! I don\u2019t deserve anything less than the very\nfinest\u2026\u201d</p><p>xxx</p><p>Aziraphale\nhad a much harder time filling out the quiz.</p><p>For\none, the angel was having trouble wrapping head around the whole thing. A\nromantic partner? He\u2019d spent thousands of years reading about humans and their\nromances and while, yes, admittedly quite a lot of it sounded very pleasant\nindeed, the rest of it seemed to be a huge mess of emotions flying every which\nway all at once. People got hurt. It could lead to blood and tears and the\noccasional stack of bodies.</p><p>It\nwas so much work! All the posturing and dressing up, struggling to make a\nfavorable impression and primping, all those strange intricate courting rituals\nthat changed every few decades for hardly any reason! Aziraphale had become\nfamiliar with many of these rituals through observance and in his literary\ncircuits, but that didn\u2019t mean he understood them. Or remembered which ones\nbelonged to when.</p><p>Did\nyou bring them a gift? Should he arrange for a chaperone? Was holding hands too\nforward?</p><p>He\ntried to think through some of the more recent films he\u2019d seen. He grimaced. </p><p>Did\nyou <i>have </i>to kiss at the end of the\ndate? Was it rude not to? What if his date tried to initiate a kiss? Or\ntried something&ndash;he shuddered&ndash;even more forward than a kiss?</p><p>Aziraphale\nwasn\u2019t sure what second base was, and didn\u2019t think he\u2019d like to find out*. </p><p>*He\nsuspected there may be a club and some small compact ball and someone shouting <i>foul</i>. Possibly there was a red card\ninvolved. It did not sound like a good time. </p><p>And\nif that wasn\u2019t enough there was the whole business of whether or not you were\neven attracted to person! It was easy enough to like someone, in a sort of\nfriendly way, but to want to do\u2026any of <i>that</i>\nwith them?</p><p>There\nwas nothing wrong with hanky-panky. If two (or more really, it wasn\u2019t any of\nhis business) people wanted to get together and be intimate, that was between\nthem. So long as everything was safe and consensual, of course. </p><p>It\njust wasn\u2019t something Aziraphale had ever thought to go looking for. It simply\nhadn\u2019t come up, and Aziraphale was fine with that. What was the point of\nmeeting up with a perfect stranger and subjecting yourself to all kinds of\nunpleasantness and discomfort and resulting indigestion? </p><p>Besides,\nthere was nothing he\u2019d really want to do with someone that he didn\u2019t already do\nwith Crowley. They went out regularly. Or stayed in. Both were perfectly lovely\nin their own ways, and the angel really didn\u2019t mind so much at all when Crowley\nfell asleep on him. Aziraphale had a hard time imagining any of this dating\nbusiness would be more enjoyable than that. </p><p>Some\nsmall thought in the back of his mind rose up, trying to connect the two trains\nof thoughts respectfully named \u2018Crowley\u2019 and \u2018dating\u2019. Aziraphale frowned. Yes,\nthe faster this whole dating business was over with, the sooner he could meet\nup with Crowley and tell him all about these terrible dates. The small thought\nsunk back down, pushed aside for the moment but still there, lurking just below\nthe surface.</p><p>His\neyes scanned the quiz in resignation.</p><p>\u201cWhat\ndo I want in a suitor? Oh\u2026perhaps someone who can appreciate books\u2026\u201d</p><p>Xxx</p><p>Crowley\nstared at his date across the restaurant they had agreed to meet at. </p><p>The demon looked like a vampire. And not the classic gothic kind. Malaphar fell somewhere\nbetween <i>Twilight</i> heart-throb and the models\non the fronts of glossy men\u2019s fashion magazines. </p><p>Tall,\nattractive, not a hair out of place, he wore a suit so sharp it made even\nCrowley feel like a slob. His gaze swept coolly over the room and landed on Crowley.\nCrowley gave a little wave. The corner of Malaphar\u2019s lip curled.</p><p>Oh\nfor someone\u2019s sake. He was out of his depth.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d\nsaid Crowley smoothly as the other demon neared their table. He flashed a\nwinning grin. \u201cGlad you could make it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\nSuppose you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cS<i>o</i>,\u201d began Crowley after a long\nuncomfortable minute of silence. \u201cWhat\u2019s your gig, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamning\nhumanity to the unending torment of Hell,\u201d was the flat reply. Malaphar wasn\u2019t looking\nat him, his attention absorbed in the wine menu.</p><p>\u201cWell\nyeah. Obviously,\u201d floundered Crowley. \u201cI mean, what\u2019s your, y\u2019know, angle?\u201d</p><p>Malaphar\nglanced sharply up at him. \u201cI suggest taking more time to think before opening\nyour mouth. Maybe you wouldn\u2019t waste so many words trying to get to the point.\u201d</p><p>Crowley\u2019s\neyes widened, struck speechless.</p><p><i>Aziraphale would </i>never <i>insult me like that,</i> he thought.<i> He lets me blabber all I like.</i></p><p>Crowley lent back, crossing his arms. \u201cAhh, I <i>see</i>. Well, you\u2019ve got the smooth, stuck-up\nbastard bit down to a tee, so congratulations.\u201d</p><p>They\nordered and sat in silence waiting for their meals. Crowley debated puling out\nhis phone and playing Candy Crush with the volume on full blast.</p><p>\u201cHere\nyou are sirs.\u201d The waitress laid their orders out on the table. Crowley\nsuppressed a sigh of relief at the welcome distraction. The steam rising off\nhis roast duck smelled delicious.</p><p>\u201cWhat\nis <i>that?</i>\u201d</p><p>Crowley\nfroze.</p><p>\u201cEr,\nsorry?\u201d asked the waitress.</p><p>\u201cThat.\u201d\nMalaphar picked at the plate of impeccably prepared Lobster Thermidor with the\nexpression of someone who had just been given a dead rat on a platter.</p><p>\u201cThe\nLobster Thermidor, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd\nwhat is it doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2026it\u2019s\nwhat you ordered, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFunny.\nI distinctly remember ordering the Lamb Ragu.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\nthat\u2019s\u2026\u201dshe checked her notebook where she had written it down. No human would\nhave noticed the slight tendril of power twisting out and wrapping around it.\nCrowley did.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I\nam so sorry, sir. I\u2019ll be right back with your order.\u201d</p><p>Malaphar\nwatched her leave impassively, a slight sneer on his face. He turned back to\nCrowley as if nothing had happened. \u201cHumans are so easy to break, aren\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh.\nYe-yeah.\u201d </p><p>Crowley\nhad quite lost his appetite.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve\nbeen up here so long,\u201d mused the other demon. \u201cSurely you must have some\nextraordinary feats of evil to your name?\u201d</p><p>The\nquestion hung in the air between them like a challenge.</p><p>\u201cOh,\nyou wouldn\u2019t believe all of what I\u2019ve done,\u201d said Crowley smoothly. \u201cIt would\ntake too much time to even list it all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry\nme.\u201d</p><p>Their\nwaitress came back, balancing a plate of Lamb Ragu.</p><p>Crowley\nsaw the exact moment she began to trip, Malaphar making a slight movement with\nhis hand. </p><p><i>Oh no you don\u2019t, you bastard!</i></p><p><i>CRASH</i></p><p>\u201cOh,\noh I am so sorry!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\nknow,\u201d said Crowley. \u201cI think red is your colour.\u201d</p><p>Malaphar\nglowered darkly at him, his immaculate suit covered in creamy tomato sauce. He\nstood in one towering movement.</p><p>\u201cYour\nmanager will be hearing about this,\u201d he hissed to the distraught waitress,\nbefore storming out the restaurant. Crowley watched him in satisfaction.</p><p>\u201cOh. Oh no.\u201d The poor waitress looked close to tears.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t\nworry about it,\u201d said Crowley, quickly wiping the last minute from the minds of everyone in the room. He cleaned up the mess with a wave of his hand. </p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d\nThat waitress stared at him blankly. \u201cSorry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust\nthe bill, thanks.\u201d He smiled at her. \u201cGreat service here. You\u2019re doing a\nmarvelous job.\u201d</p><p>Xxx</p><p>Aziraphale\nmet Pravuil at a small caf\u00e9.</p><p>He\nwas nervous, but had been put a bit at ease when he remembered she was an angel that worked in\nHeaven\u2019s archives. Surely they would have something in common?</p><p>\u201cHullo,\u201d\nhe greeted the other angel pleasantly. </p><p>\u201cAziraphale?\u201d\nshe eyed him. Pravuil had taken the form of a stern looking woman, her\nclothes neat and practical and immaculately pressed. Aziraphale thought she had\nthe look of a librarian about her and was cheered.</p><p>\u201cYes,\nyes. You must be Pravuil.\u201d He held out his hand. \u201cHow nice to meet you.\u201d</p><p>Pravuil\nstared at his hand uncomprehendingly. He lowered it guiltily.</p><p>\u201cSorry.\nIt\u2019s a human custom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs\nit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh\nyes. Shall we order?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust tea for me. I don\u2019t eat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t\u2014?\u201d\nAziraphale floundered. He couldn\u2019t imagine a world without food. It was\na terrible, lonely thought. \u201cNot even a little?\u201d he tried a desperately.<br/></p><p>\u201cNever.\nIt\u2019s too messy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\nwork with very delicate documents,\u201d she said as they got in line.</p><p>Aziraphale\nmade an understanding noise. \u201cOh yes. I suppose I know what you mean. I have a\nmodest collection of rare books myself. I won\u2019t have anyone coming near them\nwith food.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes\nthat happen?\u201d asked Pravuil with something approaching alarm. \u201cIs that\nsomething humans do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes.\nBut I send them running.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\nshould hope so!\u201d</p><p>They\nsat down at a small table, a chai tea and a mug of hot cocoa set in front of\nthem respectfully. Aziraphale worried the handle of his mug, gazing down at the\nslowly melting marshmallows floating on the surface of his drink. He was\nfeeling rather peckish, but thought it might be rude to eat something if\nPravuil was against it. His belly rumbled gently.</p><p>\u201cDo\nyou get time for much reading? Up there?\u201d asked Aziraphale, trying to \u00a0distract himself.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d\nShe took a sip of her tea. \u201cI get every seventh day off. I usually spend it in\nthe library.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s\na marvelous library, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Aziraphale would visit heaven\u2019s library when he\nwas stuck waiting for a new corporation. It was perhaps his favourite place Up\nThere, though he couldn\u2019t say it was his favourite library.</p><p>\u201cYes.\nIt is.\u201d</p><p>They\nsat in silence. Aziraphale wondered if he was doing something wrong or if this\nwas just what dating was like.</p><p>\u201cWhat\nhave you been reading lately?\u201d he asked after a while.<br/></p><p>\u00a0\u201cI\nhave an interest in the art of sigil making.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cWonderful!\nSo have I!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat have you read about it?\u201d<br/></p><p>Aziraphale\nfinally thought things were going well. They talked for a few minutes pleasantly enough.<br/></p><p>\u201cOf\ncourse, sometimes I really enjoy settling down with a good novel,\u201d he said, taking a sip of his cocoa. \u201cHave you ever\nread Wilde? He was a particular friend of mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFiction?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>She\nsniffed, something in her expression closing off. \u201cNo. I can\u2019t see the point in it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t\nsee the\u2026\u201d Aziraphale was at a loss.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s\njust made up things.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0Aziraphale felt as if someone had pulled the rug out from under him.<br/></p><p>\u201cYes\nbut, but, that\u2019s what\u2019s so fantastic about it,\u201d he said, trying to recover. \u201cThe worlds people create, the\ncharacters! The sweeping themes and beautiful phrases of prose. They put so\nmuch into these stories, so much heart and soul. I would even go so far to say\nstories are one of the greatest achievements of humankind.\u201d</p><p>Pravuil finished her tea. \u201cI can\u2019t say I care for all that. It\u2019s written by humans.\nWhat do they know?\u201d</p><p>Five\nminutes later Aziraphale and Pravuil politely said goodbye to each other,\nmutually relived the interaction was over.</p><p>Xxx</p><p>That\nwas bloody awful! </p><p>Crowley\ngot home, angrily undoing his tie and throwing it across the room. What a twat!</p><p>Of\ncourse, Crowley himself was a demon. But while he knew it was his job to mess\nwith greedy, corruptible bastards it didn\u2019t mean he enjoyed hanging out with\nthem! Bleugh! <br/></p><p>Surely\nAziraphale could be a bit of a bastard sometimes, but he was just <i>enough</i> of one to be likeable! He was a\nbastard in all the right ways, enough to be interesting and petty and enduring\nand none of the ways that were downright cruel. </p><p>He\nflopped lengthwise onto his couch, feet up on the armrest. </p><p>There\nwas a flash of light followed by a neat stack of papers landing softly on his\nchest.</p><p>He\nlooked at it wearily.</p><p>It\nwas the damn quiz.</p><p>He\ngave the sigh of the long suffering.</p><p>Only\nfour more to go. </p><p>He\nopened the papers and skimmed them. Well. This time he wouldn\u2019t ask for someone\nsleek and cool. Crowley was more than cool enough for two. And this time\u2026maybe\u2026</p><p>He\ngave a surreptitious glance around the room. He bit his lip. </p><p>Almost\nguiltily he bent to the preferences sheet and ticked off \u2018Compassionate\u2019 and\n\u2018Empathetic\u2019&hellip;</p><p>Xxx</p><p>Aziraphale\nwas pacing. Back and forth across the floor of his bookshop he walked, absently\nstepping over stacks of books and weaving around boxes that got in his path.</p><p>He\nhad come to the conclusion that his date with Pravuil had gone\u2026not terribly.</p><p>She\nhad a very high esteem of books, which was something Aziraphale always approved\nof. But they hadn\u2019t really got on. It had been such an effort. It wasn\u2019t at all\nlike meeting Crowley for lunch. They could talk for hours about anything and\neverything, or sit silently, and somehow it still felt comfortable.</p><p>Aziraphale\nsighed, and slowed to a halt. He looked down at the new quiz in his hands and\nresisted the urge to sigh again.</p><p>What\ndid he want in a partner?</p><p>He\nneeded someone with an interest in the earth.

Naturally, Aziraphale and Crowley have to participate as well\u2026</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cI\nthink you\u2019ll all find you have a lot in common,\u201d Adam was saying. \u201cDeep down,\nyou\u2019re really not that different. And this will help you all meet new people!\u201d</p><p>The\ngreat host of assembled angels and demons watched him in silent horror. They\nwere gathered in Tadfield, out in a big snowy field large enough to hold them\nall, and far enough from any buildings to avoid startling any passing humans.</p><p>The\nMetatron coughed delicately. \u201cMight I ask <i>why</i>\nyou have chosen to inflict this punishment on us all?\u201d </p><p>\u201cThe\nyoung mazter iz finally zhowing an interezt in the buiznezz,\u201d said Beelzebub\nmiserably. \u201cImprezzively zadiztic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlimey.\u201d\nAdam ran a hand through his mop of curls. He was a teenager now, and it showed\nin the deepening of his voice and the way his body had started to\nfill out. He still looked like <i>Adam</i>\nthough, like the kind of boy who runs through ditches and plays with his dog\nand organizes games for his friends to play. Only bigger.</p><p>\u201cThis\nis what I mean. You\u2019re not being punished,\u201d Adam said. \u201cI just think if you spent more time getting\nto know each other, you\u2019d find you had a lot in common. It\u2019ll be good for you!\u201d</p><p>Beelzebub\nsighed. \u201cJuzt when I think your father would be pleazed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\nwhy must this be done on the Earth?\u201d asked Metatron desperately. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s\nneutral ground.\u201d Adam rubbed his nose. \u201c\u2019Sides. If you spent more time on earth\nyou might actually like it. No more Apocalypses!\u201d</p><p>There\nwere shocked murmurs and breaking out through both sides now, the angels and\ndemons watching Adam warily. He beamed back at them, satisfied and confident in\nhis teenage logic. To be fair, he hadn\u2019t failed them yet.</p><p>\u201cYes\nbut,\u201d the Metatron\u2019s face twisted up into something distasteful. \u201cDating? It\u2019s\ninsulting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t\nHeaven support love and peace?\u201d asked Adam.</p><p>\u201c<i>Love</i>, not\u2014\u201c</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t\nfinish that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMuzt\nwe really go on a\u2026<i>date</i>,\u201d said\nBeezlebub, as if he\u2019d never said the word before, \u201cwiz whoever we are matched\nwiz?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\nyeah.\u201d Adam beamed. \u201cThat\u2019s the point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMust\nwe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t\nworry! I saw them do this at school. You just fill out the quizzes and get\nmatched with someone you like. It\u2019s wicked!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen\nyou zay \u2018wicked\u2019 do you mean zinful?\u201d said Beelzebub hopefully.</p><p>\u201cNah,\nI mean it\u2019s brilliant.\u201d Beelzebub deflated. \u201cIt\u2019s great fun! And you\u2019ll all get\nto do it a couple of times so I can narrow it right down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\nmany is a couple?\u201c asked The Metatron in alarm.</p><p>\u201cI\ndunno yet. Four? Five?\u201d</p><p>The\nfield filled with worried voices, angels and demons eyeing each other and their\nopposites across from each other nervously.<br></p><p>\u201cRight!\u201d\nAdam clapped his hands together. \u201cSo everyone pick up a quiz. You\u2019ll have until\nmidnight to fill them out, so take your time if you like. Tomorrow, you\u2019ll all go on your first date!\u201d</p><p>And\nthus ended the first official meeting of all the hosts of heaven and all the\nlegions of hell at the behest of the rebel Antichrist. Adam stood watching them\nall, disappearing back Up or Down in flashes of light, or milling about in\nshell-shocked silence. The snowy breeze rustling over the open field tossed his\nhair about gently, a solid spot of calm in a sea of uneasy.</p><p>An\nangel and a demon hurried towards him.</p><p>\u201cHullo\nyou two,\u201d said Adam brightly. \u201cIsn\u2019t it great?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr,\u201d\nbegan Aziraphale. \u201cIt\u2019s quite the plan to bring everyone together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw\nthanks! I thought it was pretty great myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\nsure ruffled them,\u201d said Crowley. \u201cJust, er\u2026everyone? Really, <i>everyone?</i>\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\nwouldn\u2019t be fair otherwise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\nmean some poor sod is going to end up with the Metatron.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr\nGabriel,\u201d added Aziraphale with a shudder.</p><p>Adam\nbeamed. \u201cThere\u2019s someone for everyone. And they all need to be more\nopen-minded. Like you chaps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\nAbout that,\u201d said Aziraphale.</p><p>\u201cWhy\ndo <i>we </i>have to do this?\u201d whined\nCrowley. \u201cWe already like earth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery\nmuch!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd\nwe\u2019ve been, y\u2019know\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cFriends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHanging\nout.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>With</i> each other,\u201d added Aziraphale.</p><p>\u201cYeah!\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor\na very long time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYears.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThousands\nof them!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince\nthe garden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh\nI know that. Trust me, I know.\u201d There was a distressingly knowing glint in Adam\u2019s\neye when he said that. Aziraphale and Crowley shuffled uncomfortably. \u201cYou two were actually my inspiration.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\nwon\u2019t make an exception or else everyone will want one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut,\u201d\nbegan Aziraphale. Then he fell silent.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s\nonly for an hour or so,\u201d said Adam kindly. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be fancy, you can just go for a cuppa. And if you don\u2019t like them you don\u2019t have\nto see them ever again. But who knows? Maybe you\u2019ll find your soul mates!\u201d</p><p>Crowley\nlent in close. \u201cBut what if you pair someone with bad blood between them? What\nif I get <i>Hastur?</i>\u201d he hissed\nnervously.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cAw,\nthat\u2019s what the quiz is for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr,\nwhat sort of a <i>quiz</i> is it?\u201d asked Aziraphale nervously, wondering if he would\nneed to brush up on his geometry. Then again, Adam was a very\u2026modern boy. Maybe\nit would be about \u2018pop culture\u2019. The angel glanced nervously at Crowley and\nshuffled closer. \u201cHow difficult is it to pass?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlimey!\nIt\u2019s not that sort of a quiz. It\u2019s asks about your <i>personality.</i> You can put your likes and dislikes and what you want\nin a date. It\u2019s bloody brilliant! Our school did it this year and that\u2019s where\nI got the idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\nI suppose\u2026that\u2019s reasonable.\u201d</p><p>Crowley\nleaned over to him. \u201cAngel, remember when I got that commendation for OkCupid?\nOnline dating?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Unfortunately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOi,\nit\u2019s made a lot of people happy too,\u201d insisted Adam.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t\nrub it in,\u201d sighed Crowley.</p><p>\u201cAnd\nif you don\u2019t like who you get, you can answer differently the next time. It\u2019ll\nbe grand. Just you wait!\u201d</p><p>xxx</p><p>Crowley\nwas sprawled across his sleek leather couch, a glass of wine on the coffee\ntable beside him. The compatibility quiz was ten pages of pink paper, fill-in-the-blanks and multiple-choice\nquestions, all bound together in a neat little booklet. Crowley ticked off\nboxes with a pen so expensive it could pay his rent for a month*.</p><p>*If\nCrowley were the sort to bother with taxes. One of the perks of being a demon\nwas unlimited cash, and credit cards that smelled faintly of sulfur when the\ntransaction when through.</p><p>\u201c\u2019About\nme\u2019,\u201d he read aloud. \u201c\u2019How would I describe myself?\u2019 Oh, you know. Cool. Fancy.\nSome might even say I\u2019m a rebel without a cause. Favourite pass-time? Oh, sin!\nSloth especially. Name a celebrity or fictional character you most relate to.\nThe name\u2019s <i>Bond</i>\u2026Hobbies, hmm, mayhem\nand mischief, naturally. A bit of plant terrorism. Tempting angels? Does that\ncount? Better put it down just in case\u2026\u201d</p><p>Crowley\nwas having fun with this.</p><p>Having\nhad a hand in online dating, he wasn\u2019t expecting much out of\nthis. Did he respect Adam? Certainly. Was he grateful for the boy stopping the\nApocalypse in its tracks? Of course. But did that mean he would be looking to a\nteenager - no matter how occultly inclined \u2013 to match him with his soul mate?\nHell\u2014<i>somewhere,</i> no.</p><p>They\nhad to do this thing what, four, five times? He may as well have some fun with\nit. And see how well it worked, anyway.</p><p>\u201c\u2019What\ndo I want in a date?\u2019 Ooh, let me see. Cool, sleek, devil-may-care. Hah.\nFashionable of course. Expensive! I don\u2019t deserve anything less than the very\nfinest\u2026\u201d</p><p>xxx</p><p>Aziraphale\nhad a much harder time filling out the quiz.</p><p>For\none, the angel was having trouble wrapping head around the whole thing. A\nromantic partner? He\u2019d spent thousands of years reading about humans and their\nromances and while, yes, admittedly quite a lot of it sounded very pleasant\nindeed, the rest of it seemed to be a huge mess of emotions flying every which\nway all at once. People got hurt. It could lead to blood and tears and the\noccasional stack of bodies.</p><p>It\nwas so much work! All the posturing and dressing up, struggling to make a\nfavorable impression and primping, all those strange intricate courting rituals\nthat changed every few decades for hardly any reason! Aziraphale had become\nfamiliar with many of these rituals through observance and in his literary\ncircuits, but that didn\u2019t mean he understood them. Or remembered which ones\nbelonged to when.</p><p>Did\nyou bring them a gift? Should he arrange for a chaperone? Was holding hands too\nforward?</p><p>He\ntried to think through some of the more recent films he\u2019d seen. He grimaced. </p><p>Did\nyou <i>have </i>to kiss at the end of the\ndate? Was it rude not to? What if his date tried to initiate a kiss? Or\ntried something\u2013he shuddered\u2013even more forward than a kiss?</p><p>Aziraphale\nwasn\u2019t sure what second base was, and didn\u2019t think he\u2019d like to find out*. </p><p>*He\nsuspected there may be a club and some small compact ball and someone shouting <i>foul</i>. Possibly there was a red card\ninvolved. It did not sound like a good time. </p><p>And\nif that wasn\u2019t enough there was the whole business of whether or not you were\neven attracted to person! It was easy enough to like someone, in a sort of\nfriendly way, but to want to do\u2026any of <i>that</i>\nwith them?</p><p>There\nwas nothing wrong with hanky-panky. If two (or more really, it wasn\u2019t any of\nhis business) people wanted to get together and be intimate, that was between\nthem. So long as everything was safe and consensual, of course. </p><p>It\njust wasn\u2019t something Aziraphale had ever thought to go looking for. It simply\nhadn\u2019t come up, and Aziraphale was fine with that. What was the point of\nmeeting up with a perfect stranger and subjecting yourself to all kinds of\nunpleasantness and discomfort and resulting indigestion? </p><p>Besides,\nthere was nothing he\u2019d really want to do with someone that he didn\u2019t already do\nwith Crowley. They went out regularly. Or stayed in. Both were perfectly lovely\nin their own ways, and the angel really didn\u2019t mind so much at all when Crowley\nfell asleep on him. Aziraphale had a hard time imagining any of this dating\nbusiness would be more enjoyable than that. </p><p>Some\nsmall thought in the back of his mind rose up, trying to connect the two trains\nof thoughts respectfully named \u2018Crowley\u2019 and \u2018dating\u2019. Aziraphale frowned. Yes,\nthe faster this whole dating business was over with, the sooner he could meet\nup with Crowley and tell him all about these terrible dates. The small thought\nsunk back down, pushed aside for the moment but still there, lurking just below\nthe surface.</p><p>His\neyes scanned the quiz in resignation.</p><p>\u201cWhat\ndo I want in a suitor? Oh\u2026perhaps someone who can appreciate books\u2026\u201d</p><p>Xxx</p><p>Crowley\nstared at his date across the restaurant they had agreed to meet at. </p><p>The demon looked like a vampire. And not the classic gothic kind. Malaphar fell somewhere\nbetween <i>Twilight</i> heart-throb and the models\non the fronts of glossy men\u2019s fashion magazines. </p><p>Tall,\nattractive, not a hair out of place, he wore a suit so sharp it made even\nCrowley feel like a slob. His gaze swept coolly over the room and landed on Crowley.\nCrowley gave a little wave. The corner of Malaphar\u2019s lip curled.</p><p>Oh\nfor someone\u2019s sake. He was out of his depth.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d\nsaid Crowley smoothly as the other demon neared their table. He flashed a\nwinning grin. \u201cGlad you could make it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\nSuppose you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cS<i>o</i>,\u201d began Crowley after a long\nuncomfortable minute of silence. \u201cWhat\u2019s your gig, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamning\nhumanity to the unending torment of Hell,\u201d was the flat reply. Malaphar wasn\u2019t looking\nat him, his attention absorbed in the wine menu.</p><p>\u201cWell\nyeah. Obviously,\u201d floundered Crowley. \u201cI mean, what\u2019s your, y\u2019know, angle?\u201d</p><p>Malaphar\nglanced sharply up at him. \u201cI suggest taking more time to think before opening\nyour mouth. Maybe you wouldn\u2019t waste so many words trying to get to the point.\u201d</p><p>Crowley\u2019s\neyes widened, struck speechless.</p><p><i>Aziraphale would </i>never <i>insult me like that,</i> he thought.<i> He lets me blabber all I like.</i></p><p>Crowley lent back, crossing his arms. \u201cAhh, I <i>see</i>. Well, you\u2019ve got the smooth, stuck-up\nbastard bit down to a tee, so congratulations.\u201d</p><p>They\nordered and sat in silence waiting for their meals. Crowley debated puling out\nhis phone and playing Candy Crush with the volume on full blast.</p><p>\u201cHere\nyou are sirs.\u201d The waitress laid their orders out on the table. Crowley\nsuppressed a sigh of relief at the welcome distraction. The steam rising off\nhis roast duck smelled delicious.</p><p>\u201cWhat\nis <i>that?</i>\u201d</p><p>Crowley\nfroze.</p><p>\u201cEr,\nsorry?\u201d asked the waitress.</p><p>\u201cThat.\u201d\nMalaphar picked at the plate of impeccably prepared Lobster Thermidor with the\nexpression of someone who had just been given a dead rat on a platter.</p><p>\u201cThe\nLobster Thermidor, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd\nwhat is it doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2026it\u2019s\nwhat you ordered, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFunny.\nI distinctly remember ordering the Lamb Ragu.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\nthat\u2019s\u2026\u201dshe checked her notebook where she had written it down. No human would\nhave noticed the slight tendril of power twisting out and wrapping around it.\nCrowley did.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I\nam so sorry, sir. I\u2019ll be right back with your order.\u201d</p><p>Malaphar\nwatched her leave impassively, a slight sneer on his face. He turned back to\nCrowley as if nothing had happened. \u201cHumans are so easy to break, aren\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh.\nYe-yeah.\u201d </p><p>Crowley\nhad quite lost his appetite.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve\nbeen up here so long,\u201d mused the other demon. \u201cSurely you must have some\nextraordinary feats of evil to your name?\u201d</p><p>The\nquestion hung in the air between them like a challenge.</p><p>\u201cOh,\nyou wouldn\u2019t believe all of what I\u2019ve done,\u201d said Crowley smoothly. \u201cIt would\ntake too much time to even list it all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry\nme.\u201d</p><p>Their\nwaitress came back, balancing a plate of Lamb Ragu.</p><p>Crowley\nsaw the exact moment she began to trip, Malaphar making a slight movement with\nhis hand. </p><p><i>Oh no you don\u2019t, you bastard!</i></p><p><i>CRASH</i></p><p>\u201cOh,\noh I am so sorry!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\nknow,\u201d said Crowley. \u201cI think red is your colour.\u201d</p><p>Malaphar\nglowered darkly at him, his immaculate suit covered in creamy tomato sauce. He\nstood in one towering movement.</p><p>\u201cYour\nmanager will be hearing about this,\u201d he hissed to the distraught waitress,\nbefore storming out the restaurant. Crowley watched him in satisfaction.</p><p>\u201cOh. Oh no.\u201d The poor waitress looked close to tears.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t\nworry about it,\u201d said Crowley, quickly wiping the last minute from the minds of everyone in the room. He cleaned up the mess with a wave of his hand. </p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d\nThat waitress stared at him blankly. \u201cSorry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust\nthe bill, thanks.\u201d He smiled at her. \u201cGreat service here. You\u2019re doing a\nmarvelous job.\u201d</p><p>Xxx</p><p>Aziraphale\nmet Pravuil at a small caf\u00e9.</p><p>He\nwas nervous, but had been put a bit at ease when he remembered she was an angel that worked in\nHeaven\u2019s archives. Surely they would have something in common?</p><p>\u201cHullo,\u201d\nhe greeted the other angel pleasantly. </p><p>\u201cAziraphale?\u201d\nshe eyed him. Pravuil had taken the form of a stern looking woman, her\nclothes neat and practical and immaculately pressed. Aziraphale thought she had\nthe look of a librarian about her and was cheered.</p><p>\u201cYes,\nyes. You must be Pravuil.\u201d He held out his hand. \u201cHow nice to meet you.\u201d</p><p>Pravuil\nstared at his hand uncomprehendingly. He lowered it guiltily.</p><p>\u201cSorry.\nIt\u2019s a human custom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs\nit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh\nyes. Shall we order?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust tea for me. I don\u2019t eat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t\u2014?\u201d\nAziraphale floundered. He couldn\u2019t imagine a world without food. It was\na terrible, lonely thought. \u201cNot even a little?\u201d he tried a desperately.<br></p><p>\u201cNever.\nIt\u2019s too messy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\nwork with very delicate documents,\u201d she said as they got in line.</p><p>Aziraphale\nmade an understanding noise. \u201cOh yes. I suppose I know what you mean. I have a\nmodest collection of rare books myself. I won\u2019t have anyone coming near them\nwith food.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes\nthat happen?\u201d asked Pravuil with something approaching alarm. \u201cIs that\nsomething humans do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes.\nBut I send them running.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\nshould hope so!\u201d</p><p>They\nsat down at a small table, a chai tea and a mug of hot cocoa set in front of\nthem respectfully. Aziraphale worried the handle of his mug, gazing down at the\nslowly melting marshmallows floating on the surface of his drink. He was\nfeeling rather peckish, but thought it might be rude to eat something if\nPravuil was against it. His belly rumbled gently.</p><p>\u201cDo\nyou get time for much reading? Up there?\u201d asked Aziraphale, trying to \u00a0distract himself.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d\nShe took a sip of her tea. \u201cI get every seventh day off. I usually spend it in\nthe library.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s\na marvelous library, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Aziraphale would visit heaven\u2019s library when he\nwas stuck waiting for a new corporation. It was perhaps his favourite place Up\nThere, though he couldn\u2019t say it was his favourite library.</p><p>\u201cYes.\nIt is.\u201d</p><p>They\nsat in silence. Aziraphale wondered if he was doing something wrong or if this\nwas just what dating was like.</p><p>\u201cWhat\nhave you been reading lately?\u201d he asked after a while.<br></p><p>\u00a0\u201cI\nhave an interest in the art of sigil making.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWonderful!\nSo have I!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat have you read about it?\u201d<br></p><p>Aziraphale\nfinally thought things were going well. They talked for a few minutes pleasantly enough.<br></p><p>\u201cOf\ncourse, sometimes I really enjoy settling down with a good novel,\u201d he said, taking a sip of his cocoa. \u201cHave you ever\nread Wilde? He was a particular friend of mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFiction?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>She\nsniffed, something in her expression closing off. \u201cNo. I can\u2019t see the point in it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t\nsee the\u2026\u201d Aziraphale was at a loss.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s\njust made up things.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0Aziraphale felt as if someone had pulled the rug out from under him.<br></p><p>\u201cYes\nbut, but, that\u2019s what\u2019s so fantastic about it,\u201d he said, trying to recover. \u201cThe worlds people create, the\ncharacters! The sweeping themes and beautiful phrases of prose. They put so\nmuch into these stories, so much heart and soul. I would even go so far to say\nstories are one of the greatest achievements of humankind.\u201d</p><p>Pravuil finished her tea. \u201cI can\u2019t say I care for all that. It\u2019s written by humans.\nWhat do they know?\u201d</p><p>Five\nminutes later Aziraphale and Pravuil politely said goodbye to each other,\nmutually relived the interaction was over.</p><p>Xxx</p><p>That\nwas bloody awful! </p><p>Crowley\ngot home, angrily undoing his tie and throwing it across the room. What a twat!</p><p>Of\ncourse, Crowley himself was a demon. But while he knew it was his job to mess\nwith greedy, corruptible bastards it didn\u2019t mean he enjoyed hanging out with\nthem! Bleugh! <br></p><p>Surely\nAziraphale could be a bit of a bastard sometimes, but he was just <i>enough</i> of one to be likeable! He was a\nbastard in all the right ways, enough to be interesting and petty and enduring\nand none of the ways that were downright cruel. </p><p>He\nflopped lengthwise onto his couch, feet up on the armrest. </p><p>There\nwas a flash of light followed by a neat stack of papers landing softly on his\nchest.</p><p>He\nlooked at it wearily.</p><p>It\nwas the damn quiz.</p><p>He\ngave the sigh of the long suffering.</p><p>Only\nfour more to go. </p><p>He\nopened the papers and skimmed them. Well. This time he wouldn\u2019t ask for someone\nsleek and cool. Crowley was more than cool enough for two. And this time\u2026maybe\u2026</p><p>He\ngave a surreptitious glance around the room. He bit his lip. </p><p>Almost\nguiltily he bent to the preferences sheet and ticked off \u2018Compassionate\u2019 and\n\u2018Empathetic\u2019\u2026</p><p>Xxx</p><p>Aziraphale\nwas pacing. Back and forth across the floor of his bookshop he walked, absently\nstepping over stacks of books and weaving around boxes that got in his path.</p><p>He\nhad come to the conclusion that his date with Pravuil had gone\u2026not terribly.</p><p>She\nhad a very high esteem of books, which was something Aziraphale always approved\nof. But they hadn\u2019t really got on. It had been such an effort. It wasn\u2019t at all\nlike meeting Crowley for lunch. They could talk for hours about anything and\neverything, or sit silently, and somehow it still felt comfortable.</p><p>Aziraphale\nsighed, and slowed to a halt. He looked down at the new quiz in his hands and\nresisted the urge to sigh again.</p><p>What\ndid he want in a partner?</p><p>He\nneeded someone with an interest in the earth. He needed someone with a <i>spark</i>,\nwith a certain\u2026<br></p><p>The\nangle snapped his fingers. \u201cThat\u2019s it!\u201d</p><p>\u00a0He\nhurried over to his desk and scrambled about for a pen.</p><p>\u201cMust\nhave a sense of humor\u2026\u201d he wrote.</p>",

They really have a lot in common, after all. To make his point, Adam has every angel and demon fill out compatibility quizzes and go on a date with whoever they get matched with. But not just once. Oh no. They have to do it Five times. Five different dates in five days. Naturally, Aziraphale and Crowley have to participate as well\u2026</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cI\nthink you\u2019ll all find you have a lot in common,\u201d Adam was saying. \u201cDeep down,\nyou\u2019re really not that different. And this will help you all meet new people!\u201d</p><p>The\ngreat host of assembled angels and demons watched him in silent horror. They\nwere gathered in Tadfield, out in a big snowy field large enough to hold them\nall, and far enough from any buildings to avoid startling any passing humans.</p><p>The\nMetatron coughed delicately. \u201cMight I ask <i>why</i>\nyou have chosen to inflict this punishment on us all?\u201d </p><p>\u201cThe\nyoung mazter iz finally zhowing an interezt in the buiznezz,\u201d said Beelzebub\nmiserably. \u201cImprezzively zadiztic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlimey.\u201d\nAdam ran a hand through his mop of curls. He was a teenager now, and it showed\nin the deepening of his voice and the way his body had started to\nfill out. He still looked like <i>Adam</i>\nthough, like the kind of boy who runs through ditches and plays with his dog\nand organizes games for his friends to play. Only bigger.</p><p>\u201cThis\nis what I mean. You\u2019re not being punished,\u201d Adam said. \u201cI just think if you spent more time getting\nto know each other, you\u2019d find you had a lot in common. It\u2019ll be good for you!\u201d</p><p>Beelzebub\nsighed. \u201cJuzt when I think your father would be pleazed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\nwhy must this be done on the Earth?\u201d asked Metatron desperately. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s\nneutral ground.\u201d Adam rubbed his nose. \u201c\u2019Sides. If you spent more time on earth\nyou might actually like it. No more Apocalypses!\u201d</p><p>There\nwere shocked murmurs and breaking out through both sides now, the angels and\ndemons watching Adam warily. He beamed back at them, satisfied and confident in\nhis teenage logic. To be fair, he hadn\u2019t failed them yet.</p><p>\u201cYes\nbut,\u201d the Metatron\u2019s face twisted up into something distasteful. \u201cDating? It\u2019s\ninsulting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t\nHeaven support love and peace?\u201d asked Adam.</p><p>\u201c<i>Love</i>, not\u2014\u201c</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t\nfinish that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMuzt\nwe really go on a\u2026<i>date</i>,\u201d said\nBeezlebub, as if he\u2019d never said the word before, \u201cwiz whoever we are matched\nwiz?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\nyeah.\u201d Adam beamed. \u201cThat\u2019s the point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMust\nwe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t\nworry! I saw them do this at school. You just fill out the quizzes and get\nmatched with someone you like. It\u2019s wicked!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen\nyou zay \u2018wicked\u2019 do you mean zinful?\u201d said Beelzebub hopefully.</p><p>\u201cNah,\nI mean it\u2019s brilliant.\u201d Beelzebub deflated. \u201cIt\u2019s great fun! And you\u2019ll all get\nto do it a couple of times so I can narrow it right down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\nmany is a couple?\u201c asked The Metatron in alarm.</p><p>\u201cI\ndunno yet. Four? Five?\u201d</p><p>The\nfield filled with worried voices, angels and demons eyeing each other and their\nopposites across from each other nervously.<br></p><p>\u201cRight!\u201d\nAdam clapped his hands together. \u201cSo everyone pick up a quiz. You\u2019ll have until\nmidnight to fill them out, so take your time if you like. Tomorrow, you\u2019ll all go on your first date!\u201d</p><p>And\nthus ended the first official meeting of all the hosts of heaven and all the\nlegions of hell at the behest of the rebel Antichrist. Adam stood watching them\nall, disappearing back Up or Down in flashes of light, or milling about in\nshell-shocked silence. The snowy breeze rustling over the open field tossed his\nhair about gently, a solid spot of calm in a sea of uneasy.</p><p>An\nangel and a demon hurried towards him.</p><p>\u201cHullo\nyou two,\u201d said Adam brightly. \u201cIsn\u2019t it great?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr,\u201d\nbegan Aziraphale. \u201cIt\u2019s quite the plan to bring everyone together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw\nthanks! I thought it was pretty great myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\nsure ruffled them,\u201d said Crowley. \u201cJust, er\u2026everyone? Really, <i>everyone?</i>\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\nwouldn\u2019t be fair otherwise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\nmean some poor sod is going to end up with the Metatron.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr\nGabriel,\u201d added Aziraphale with a shudder.</p><p>Adam\nbeamed. \u201cThere\u2019s someone for everyone. And they all need to be more\nopen-minded. Like you chaps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\nAbout that,\u201d said Aziraphale.</p><p>\u201cWhy\ndo <i>we </i>have to do this?\u201d whined\nCrowley. \u201cWe already like earth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery\nmuch!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd\nwe\u2019ve been, y\u2019know\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cFriends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHanging\nout.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>With</i> each other,\u201d added Aziraphale.</p><p>\u201cYeah!\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor\na very long time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYears.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThousands\nof them!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince\nthe garden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh\nI know that. Trust me, I know.\u201d There was a distressingly knowing glint in Adam\u2019s\neye when he said that. Aziraphale and Crowley shuffled uncomfortably. \u201cYou two were actually my inspiration.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\nwon\u2019t make an exception or else everyone will want one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut,\u201d\nbegan Aziraphale. Then he fell silent.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s\nonly for an hour or so,\u201d said Adam kindly. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be fancy, you can just go for a cuppa. And if you don\u2019t like them you don\u2019t have\nto see them ever again. But who knows? Maybe you\u2019ll find your soul mates!\u201d</p><p>Crowley\nlent in close. \u201cBut what if you pair someone with bad blood between them? What\nif I get <i>Hastur?</i>\u201d he hissed\nnervously.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cAw,\nthat\u2019s what the quiz is for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr,\nwhat sort of a <i>quiz</i> is it?\u201d asked Aziraphale nervously, wondering if he would\nneed to brush up on his geometry. Then again, Adam was a very\u2026modern boy. Maybe\nit would be about \u2018pop culture\u2019. The angel glanced nervously at Crowley and\nshuffled closer. \u201cHow difficult is it to pass?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlimey!\nIt\u2019s not that sort of a quiz. It\u2019s asks about your <i>personality.</i> You can put your likes and dislikes and what you want\nin a date. It\u2019s bloody brilliant! Our school did it this year and that\u2019s where\nI got the idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\nI suppose\u2026that\u2019s reasonable.\u201d</p><p>Crowley\nleaned over to him. \u201cAngel, remember when I got that commendation for OkCupid?\nOnline dating?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Unfortunately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOi,\nit\u2019s made a lot of people happy too,\u201d insisted Adam.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t\nrub it in,\u201d sighed Crowley.</p><p>\u201cAnd\nif you don\u2019t like who you get, you can answer differently the next time. It\u2019ll\nbe grand. Just you wait!\u201d</p><p>xxx</p><p>Crowley\nwas sprawled across his sleek leather couch, a glass of wine on the coffee\ntable beside him. The compatibility quiz was ten pages of pink paper, fill-in-the-blanks and multiple-choice\nquestions, all bound together in a neat little booklet. Crowley ticked off\nboxes with a pen so expensive it could pay his rent for a month*.</p><p>*If\nCrowley were the sort to bother with taxes. One of the perks of being a demon\nwas unlimited cash, and credit cards that smelled faintly of sulfur when the\ntransaction when through.</p><p>\u201c\u2019About\nme\u2019,\u201d he read aloud. \u201c\u2019How would I describe myself?\u2019 Oh, you know. Cool. Fancy.\nSome might even say I\u2019m a rebel without a cause. Favourite pass-time? Oh, sin!\nSloth especially. Name a celebrity or fictional character you most relate to.\nThe name\u2019s <i>Bond</i>\u2026Hobbies, hmm, mayhem\nand mischief, naturally. A bit of plant terrorism. Tempting angels? Does that\ncount? Better put it down just in case\u2026\u201d</p><p>Crowley\nwas having fun with this.</p><p>Having\nhad a hand in online dating, he wasn\u2019t expecting much out of\nthis. Did he respect Adam? Certainly. Was he grateful for the boy stopping the\nApocalypse in its tracks? Of course. But did that mean he would be looking to a\nteenager - no matter how occultly inclined \u2013 to match him with his soul mate?\nHell\u2014<i>somewhere,</i> no.</p><p>They\nhad to do this thing what, four, five times? He may as well have some fun with\nit. And see how well it worked, anyway.</p><p>\u201c\u2019What\ndo I want in a date?\u2019 Ooh, let me see. Cool, sleek, devil-may-care. Hah.\nFashionable of course. Expensive! I don\u2019t deserve anything less than the very\nfinest\u2026\u201d</p><p>xxx</p><p>Aziraphale\nhad a much harder time filling out the quiz.</p><p>For\none, the angel was having trouble wrapping head around the whole thing. A\nromantic partner? He\u2019d spent thousands of years reading about humans and their\nromances and while, yes, admittedly quite a lot of it sounded very pleasant\nindeed, the rest of it seemed to be a huge mess of emotions flying every which\nway all at once. People got hurt. It could lead to blood and tears and the\noccasional stack of bodies.</p><p>It\nwas so much work! All the posturing and dressing up, struggling to make a\nfavorable impression and primping, all those strange intricate courting rituals\nthat changed every few decades for hardly any reason! Aziraphale had become\nfamiliar with many of these rituals through observance and in his literary\ncircuits, but that didn\u2019t mean he understood them. Or remembered which ones\nbelonged to when.</p><p>Did\nyou bring them a gift? Should he arrange for a chaperone? Was holding hands too\nforward?</p><p>He\ntried to think through some of the more recent films he\u2019d seen. He grimaced. </p><p>Did\nyou <i>have </i>to kiss at the end of the\ndate? Was it rude not to? What if his date tried to initiate a kiss? Or\ntried something\u2013he shuddered\u2013even more forward than a kiss?</p><p>Aziraphale\nwasn\u2019t sure what second base was, and didn\u2019t think he\u2019d like to find out*. </p><p>*He\nsuspected there may be a club and some small compact ball and someone shouting <i>foul</i>. Possibly there was a red card\ninvolved. It did not sound like a good time. </p><p>And\nif that wasn\u2019t enough there was the whole business of whether or not you were\neven attracted to person! It was easy enough to like someone, in a sort of\nfriendly way, but to want to do\u2026any of <i>that</i>\nwith them?</p><p>There\nwas nothing wrong with hanky-panky. If two (or more really, it wasn\u2019t any of\nhis business) people wanted to get together and be intimate, that was between\nthem. So long as everything was safe and consensual, of course. </p><p>It\njust wasn\u2019t something Aziraphale had ever thought to go looking for. It simply\nhadn\u2019t come up, and Aziraphale was fine with that. What was the point of\nmeeting up with a perfect stranger and subjecting yourself to all kinds of\nunpleasantness and discomfort and resulting indigestion? </p><p>Besides,\nthere was nothing he\u2019d really want to do with someone that he didn\u2019t already do\nwith Crowley. They went out regularly. Or stayed in. Both were perfectly lovely\nin their own ways, and the angel really didn\u2019t mind so much at all when Crowley\nfell asleep on him. Aziraphale had a hard time imagining any of this dating\nbusiness would be more enjoyable than that. </p><p>Some\nsmall thought in the back of his mind rose up, trying to connect the two trains\nof thoughts respectfully named \u2018Crowley\u2019 and \u2018dating\u2019. Aziraphale frowned. Yes,\nthe faster this whole dating business was over with, the sooner he could meet\nup with Crowley and tell him all about these terrible dates. The small thought\nsunk back down, pushed aside for the moment but still there, lurking just below\nthe surface.</p><p>His\neyes scanned the quiz in resignation.</p><p>\u201cWhat\ndo I want in a suitor? Oh\u2026perhaps someone who can appreciate books\u2026\u201d</p><p>Xxx</p><p>Crowley\nstared at his date across the restaurant they had agreed to meet at. </p><p>The demon looked like a vampire. And not the classic gothic kind. Malaphar fell somewhere\nbetween <i>Twilight</i> heart-throb and the models\non the fronts of glossy men\u2019s fashion magazines. </p><p>Tall,\nattractive, not a hair out of place, he wore a suit so sharp it made even\nCrowley feel like a slob. His gaze swept coolly over the room and landed on Crowley.\nCrowley gave a little wave. The corner of Malaphar\u2019s lip curled.</p><p>Oh\nfor someone\u2019s sake. He was out of his depth.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d\nsaid Crowley smoothly as the other demon neared their table. He flashed a\nwinning grin. \u201cGlad you could make it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\nSuppose you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cS<i>o</i>,\u201d began Crowley after a long\nuncomfortable minute of silence. \u201cWhat\u2019s your gig, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamning\nhumanity to the unending torment of Hell,\u201d was the flat reply. Malaphar wasn\u2019t looking\nat him, his attention absorbed in the wine menu.</p><p>\u201cWell\nyeah. Obviously,\u201d floundered Crowley. \u201cI mean, what\u2019s your, y\u2019know, angle?\u201d</p><p>Malaphar\nglanced sharply up at him. \u201cI suggest taking more time to think before opening\nyour mouth. Maybe you wouldn\u2019t waste so many words trying to get to the point.\u201d</p><p>Crowley\u2019s\neyes widened, struck speechless.</p><p><i>Aziraphale would </i>never <i>insult me like that,</i> he thought.<i> He lets me blabber all I like.</i></p><p>Crowley lent back, crossing his arms. \u201cAhh, I <i>see</i>. Well, you\u2019ve got the smooth, stuck-up\nbastard bit down to a tee, so congratulations.\u201d</p><p>They\nordered and sat in silence waiting for their meals. Crowley debated puling out\nhis phone and playing Candy Crush with the volume on full blast.</p><p>\u201cHere\nyou are sirs.\u201d The waitress laid their orders out on the table. Crowley\nsuppressed a sigh of relief at the welcome distraction. The steam rising off\nhis roast duck smelled delicious.</p><p>\u201cWhat\nis <i>that?</i>\u201d</p><p>Crowley\nfroze.</p><p>\u201cEr,\nsorry?\u201d asked the waitress.</p><p>\u201cThat.\u201d\nMalaphar picked at the plate of impeccably prepared Lobster Thermidor with the\nexpression of someone who had just been given a dead rat on a platter.</p><p>\u201cThe\nLobster Thermidor, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd\nwhat is it doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2026it\u2019s\nwhat you ordered, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFunny.\nI distinctly remember ordering the Lamb Ragu.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\nthat\u2019s\u2026\u201dshe checked her notebook where she had written it down. No human would\nhave noticed the slight tendril of power twisting out and wrapping around it.\nCrowley did.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I\nam so sorry, sir. I\u2019ll be right back with your order.\u201d</p><p>Malaphar\nwatched her leave impassively, a slight sneer on his face. He turned back to\nCrowley as if nothing had happened. \u201cHumans are so easy to break, aren\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh.\nYe-yeah.\u201d </p><p>Crowley\nhad quite lost his appetite.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve\nbeen up here so long,\u201d mused the other demon. \u201cSurely you must have some\nextraordinary feats of evil to your name?\u201d</p><p>The\nquestion hung in the air between them like a challenge.</p><p>\u201cOh,\nyou wouldn\u2019t believe all of what I\u2019ve done,\u201d said Crowley smoothly. \u201cIt would\ntake too much time to even list it all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry\nme.\u201d</p><p>Their\nwaitress came back, balancing a plate of Lamb Ragu.</p><p>Crowley\nsaw the exact moment she began to trip, Malaphar making a slight movement with\nhis hand. </p><p><i>Oh no you don\u2019t, you bastard!</i></p><p><i>CRASH</i></p><p>\u201cOh,\noh I am so sorry!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\nknow,\u201d said Crowley. \u201cI think red is your colour.\u201d</p><p>Malaphar\nglowered darkly at him, his immaculate suit covered in creamy tomato sauce. He\nstood in one towering movement.</p><p>\u201cYour\nmanager will be hearing about this,\u201d he hissed to the distraught waitress,\nbefore storming out the restaurant. Crowley watched him in satisfaction.</p><p>\u201cOh. Oh no.\u201d The poor waitress looked close to tears.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t\nworry about it,\u201d said Crowley, quickly wiping the last minute from the minds of everyone in the room. He cleaned up the mess with a wave of his hand. </p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d\nThat waitress stared at him blankly. \u201cSorry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust\nthe bill, thanks.\u201d He smiled at her. \u201cGreat service here. You\u2019re doing a\nmarvelous job.\u201d</p><p>Xxx</p><p>Aziraphale\nmet Pravuil at a small caf\u00e9.</p><p>He\nwas nervous, but had been put a bit at ease when he remembered she was an angel that worked in\nHeaven\u2019s archives. Surely they would have something in common?</p><p>\u201cHullo,\u201d\nhe greeted the other angel pleasantly. </p><p>\u201cAziraphale?\u201d\nshe eyed him. Pravuil had taken the form of a stern looking woman, her\nclothes neat and practical and immaculately pressed. Aziraphale thought she had\nthe look of a librarian about her and was cheered.</p><p>\u201cYes,\nyes. You must be Pravuil.\u201d He held out his hand. \u201cHow nice to meet you.\u201d</p><p>Pravuil\nstared at his hand uncomprehendingly. He lowered it guiltily.</p><p>\u201cSorry.\nIt\u2019s a human custom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs\nit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh\nyes. Shall we order?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust tea for me. I don\u2019t eat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t\u2014?\u201d\nAziraphale floundered. He couldn\u2019t imagine a world without food. It was\na terrible, lonely thought. \u201cNot even a little?\u201d he tried a desperately.<br></p><p>\u201cNever.\nIt\u2019s too messy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\nwork with very delicate documents,\u201d she said as they got in line.</p><p>Aziraphale\nmade an understanding noise. \u201cOh yes. I suppose I know what you mean. I have a\nmodest collection of rare books myself. I won\u2019t have anyone coming near them\nwith food.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes\nthat happen?\u201d asked Pravuil with something approaching alarm. \u201cIs that\nsomething humans do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes.\nBut I send them running.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\nshould hope so!\u201d</p><p>They\nsat down at a small table, a chai tea and a mug of hot cocoa set in front of\nthem respectfully. Aziraphale worried the handle of his mug, gazing down at the\nslowly melting marshmallows floating on the surface of his drink. He was\nfeeling rather peckish, but thought it might be rude to eat something if\nPravuil was against it. His belly rumbled gently.</p><p>\u201cDo\nyou get time for much reading? Up there?\u201d asked Aziraphale, trying to \u00a0distract himself.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d\nShe took a sip of her tea. \u201cI get every seventh day off. I usually spend it in\nthe library.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s\na marvelous library, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Aziraphale would visit heaven\u2019s library when he\nwas stuck waiting for a new corporation. It was perhaps his favourite place Up\nThere, though he couldn\u2019t say it was his favourite library.</p><p>\u201cYes.\nIt is.\u201d</p><p>They\nsat in silence. Aziraphale wondered if he was doing something wrong or if this\nwas just what dating was like.</p><p>\u201cWhat\nhave you been reading lately?\u201d he asked after a while.<br></p><p>\u00a0\u201cI\nhave an interest in the art of sigil making.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWonderful!\nSo have I!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat have you read about it?\u201d<br></p><p>Aziraphale\nfinally thought things were going well. They talked for a few minutes pleasantly enough.<br></p><p>\u201cOf\ncourse, sometimes I really enjoy settling down with a good novel,\u201d he said, taking a sip of his cocoa. \u201cHave you ever\nread Wilde? He was a particular friend of mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFiction?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>She\nsniffed, something in her expression closing off. \u201cNo. I can\u2019t see the point in it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t\nsee the\u2026\u201d Aziraphale was at a loss.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s\njust made up things.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0Aziraphale felt as if someone had pulled the rug out from under him.<br></p><p>\u201cYes\nbut, but, that\u2019s what\u2019s so fantastic about it,\u201d he said, trying to recover. \u201cThe worlds people create, the\ncharacters! The sweeping themes and beautiful phrases of prose. They put so\nmuch into these stories, so much heart and soul. I would even go so far to say\nstories are one of the greatest achievements of humankind.\u201d</p><p>Pravuil finished her tea. \u201cI can\u2019t say I care for all that. It\u2019s written by humans.\nWhat do they know?\u201d</p><p>Five\nminutes later Aziraphale and Pravuil politely said goodbye to each other,\nmutually relived the interaction was over.</p><p>Xxx</p><p>That\nwas bloody awful! </p><p>Crowley\ngot home, angrily undoing his tie and throwing it across the room. What a twat!</p><p>Of\ncourse, Crowley himself was a demon. But while he knew it was his job to mess\nwith greedy, corruptible bastards it didn\u2019t mean he enjoyed hanging out with\nthem! Bleugh! <br></p><p>Surely\nAziraphale could be a bit of a bastard sometimes, but he was just <i>enough</i> of one to be likeable! He was a\nbastard in all the right ways, enough to be interesting and petty and enduring\nand none of the ways that were downright cruel. </p><p>He\nflopped lengthwise onto his couch, feet up on the armrest. </p><p>There\nwas a flash of light followed by a neat stack of papers landing softly on his\nchest.</p><p>He\nlooked at it wearily.</p><p>It\nwas the damn quiz.</p><p>He\ngave the sigh of the long suffering.</p><p>Only\nfour more to go. </p><p>He\nopened the papers and skimmed them. Well. This time he wouldn\u2019t ask for someone\nsleek and cool. Crowley was more than cool enough for two. And this time\u2026maybe\u2026</p><p>He\ngave a surreptitious glance around the room. He bit his lip. </p><p>Almost\nguiltily he bent to the preferences sheet and ticked off \u2018Compassionate\u2019 and\n\u2018Empathetic\u2019\u2026</p><p>Xxx</p><p>Aziraphale\nwas pacing. Back and forth across the floor of his bookshop he walked, absently\nstepping over stacks of books and weaving around boxes that got in his path.</p><p>He\nhad come to the conclusion that his date with Pravuil had gone\u2026not terribly.</p><p>She\nhad a very high esteem of books, which was something Aziraphale always approved\nof. But they hadn\u2019t really got on. It had been such an effort. It wasn\u2019t at all\nlike meeting Crowley for lunch. They could talk for hours about anything and\neverything, or sit silently, and somehow it still felt comfortable.</p><p>Aziraphale\nsighed, and slowed to a halt. He looked down at the new quiz in his hands and\nresisted the urge to sigh again.</p><p>What\ndid he want in a partner?</p><p>He\nneeded someone with an interest in the earth. He needed someone with a <i>spark</i>,\nwith a certain\u2026<br></p><p>The\nangle snapped his fingers. \u201cThat\u2019s it!\u201d</p><p>\u00a0He\nhurried over to his desk and scrambled about for a pen.</p><p>\u201cMust\nhave a sense of humor\u2026\u201d he wrote.</p>",
                "content": "<p>Chapter: 1/5</p><p>Words: 3379</p><p>Relationships: Aziraphale/Crowley<br /></p><p>Adam reasons that if Heaven and Hell just got to know each other a bit better, they wouldn&rsquo;t be so keen to start another Apocalypse. They really have a lot in common, after all. To make his point, Adam has every angel and demon fill out compatibility quizzes and go on a date with whoever they get matched with. But not just once. Oh no. They have to do it Five times. Five different dates in five days. Naturally, Aziraphale and Crowley have to participate as well&hellip;</p><p>&ldquo;I\nthink you&rsquo;ll all find you have a lot in common,&rdquo; Adam was saying. &ldquo;Deep down,\nyou&rsquo;re really not that different. And this will help you all meet new people!&rdquo;</p><p>The\ngreat host of assembled angels and demons watched him in silent horror. They\nwere gathered in Tadfield, out in a big snowy field large enough to hold them\nall, and far enough from any buildings to avoid startling any passing humans.</p><p>The\nMetatron coughed delicately. &ldquo;Might I ask <i>why</i>\nyou have chosen to inflict this punishment on us all?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;The\nyoung mazter iz finally zhowing an interezt in the buiznezz,&rdquo; said Beelzebub\nmiserably. &ldquo;Imprezzively zadiztic.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Blimey.&rdquo;\nAdam ran a hand through his mop of curls. He was a teenager now, and it showed\nin the deepening of his voice and the way his body had started to\nfill out. He still looked like <i>Adam</i>\nthough, like the kind of boy who runs through ditches and plays with his dog\nand organizes games for his friends to play. Only bigger.</p><p>&ldquo;This\nis what I mean. You&rsquo;re not being punished,&rdquo; Adam said. &ldquo;I just think if you spent more time getting\nto know each other, you&rsquo;d find you had a lot in common. It&rsquo;ll be good for you!&rdquo;</p><p>Beelzebub\nsighed. &ldquo;Juzt when I think your father would be pleazed.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But\nwhy must this be done on the Earth?&rdquo; asked Metatron desperately. </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s\nneutral ground.&rdquo; Adam rubbed his nose. &ldquo;&rsquo;Sides. If you spent more time on earth\nyou might actually like it. No more Apocalypses!&rdquo;</p><p>There\nwere shocked murmurs and breaking out through both sides now, the angels and\ndemons watching Adam warily. He beamed back at them, satisfied and confident in\nhis teenage logic. To be fair, he hadn&rsquo;t failed them yet.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes\nbut,&rdquo; the Metatron&rsquo;s face twisted up into something distasteful. &ldquo;Dating? It&rsquo;s\ninsulting.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t\nHeaven support love and peace?&rdquo; asked Adam.</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Love</i>, not&mdash;&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t\nfinish that.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Muzt\nwe really go on a&hellip;<i>date</i>,&rdquo; said\nBeezlebub, as if he&rsquo;d never said the word before, &ldquo;wiz whoever we are matched\nwiz?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh,\nyeah.&rdquo; Adam beamed. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the point.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Must\nwe?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t\nworry! I saw them do this at school. You just fill out the quizzes and get\nmatched with someone you like. It&rsquo;s wicked!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;When\nyou zay &lsquo;wicked&rsquo; do you mean zinful?&rdquo; said Beelzebub hopefully.</p><p>&ldquo;Nah,\nI mean it&rsquo;s brilliant.&rdquo; Beelzebub deflated. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s great fun! And you&rsquo;ll all get\nto do it a couple of times so I can narrow it right down.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How\nmany is a couple?&ldquo; asked The Metatron in alarm.</p><p>&ldquo;I\ndunno yet. Four? Five?&rdquo;</p><p>The\nfield filled with worried voices, angels and demons eyeing each other and their\nopposites across from each other nervously.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Right!&rdquo;\nAdam clapped his hands together. &ldquo;So everyone pick up a quiz. You&rsquo;ll have until\nmidnight to fill them out, so take your time if you like. Tomorrow, you&rsquo;ll all go on your first date!&rdquo;</p><p>And\nthus ended the first official meeting of all the hosts of heaven and all the\nlegions of hell at the behest of the rebel Antichrist. Adam stood watching them\nall, disappearing back Up or Down in flashes of light, or milling about in\nshell-shocked silence. The snowy breeze rustling over the open field tossed his\nhair about gently, a solid spot of calm in a sea of uneasy.</p><p>An\nangel and a demon hurried towards him.</p><p>&ldquo;Hullo\nyou two,&rdquo; said Adam brightly. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it great?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Er,&rdquo;\nbegan Aziraphale. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s quite the plan to bring everyone together.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Aw\nthanks! I thought it was pretty great myself.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You\nsure ruffled them,&rdquo; said Crowley. &ldquo;Just, er&hellip;everyone? Really, <i>everyone?</i>&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It\nwouldn&rsquo;t be fair otherwise.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I\nmean some poor sod is going to end up with the Metatron.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Or\nGabriel,&rdquo; added Aziraphale with a shudder.</p><p>Adam\nbeamed. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s someone for everyone. And they all need to be more\nopen-minded. Like you chaps.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes.\nAbout that,&rdquo; said Aziraphale.</p><p>&ldquo;Why\ndo <i>we </i>have to do this?&rdquo; whined\nCrowley. &ldquo;We already like earth.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Very\nmuch!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And\nwe&rsquo;ve been, y&rsquo;know&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Friends.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hanging\nout.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;<i>With</i> each other,&rdquo; added Aziraphale.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;For\na very long time.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Years.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thousands\nof them!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Since\nthe garden.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh\nI know that. Trust me, I know.&rdquo; There was a distressingly knowing glint in Adam&rsquo;s\neye when he said that. Aziraphale and Crowley shuffled uncomfortably. &ldquo;You two were actually my inspiration.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But I\nwon&rsquo;t make an exception or else everyone will want one.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo;\nbegan Aziraphale. Then he fell silent.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s\nonly for an hour or so,&rdquo; said Adam kindly. &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t have to be fancy, you can just go for a cuppa. And if you don&rsquo;t like them you don&rsquo;t have\nto see them ever again. But who knows? Maybe you&rsquo;ll find your soul mates!&rdquo;</p><p>Crowley\nlent in close. &ldquo;But what if you pair someone with bad blood between them? What\nif I get <i>Hastur?</i>&rdquo; he hissed\nnervously.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Aw,\nthat&rsquo;s what the quiz is for.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Er,\nwhat sort of a <i>quiz</i> is it?&rdquo; asked Aziraphale nervously, wondering if he would\nneed to brush up on his geometry. Then again, Adam was a very&hellip;modern boy. Maybe\nit would be about &lsquo;pop culture&rsquo;. The angel glanced nervously at Crowley and\nshuffled closer. &ldquo;How difficult is it to pass?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Blimey!\nIt&rsquo;s not that sort of a quiz. It&rsquo;s asks about your <i>personality.</i> You can put your likes and dislikes and what you want\nin a date. It&rsquo;s bloody brilliant! Our school did it this year and that&rsquo;s where\nI got the idea.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh.\nI suppose&hellip;that&rsquo;s reasonable.&rdquo;</p><p>Crowley\nleaned over to him. &ldquo;Angel, remember when I got that commendation for OkCupid?\nOnline dating?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ah.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes. Unfortunately.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oi,\nit&rsquo;s made a lot of people happy too,&rdquo; insisted Adam.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t\nrub it in,&rdquo; sighed Crowley.</p><p>&ldquo;And\nif you don&rsquo;t like who you get, you can answer differently the next time. It&rsquo;ll\nbe grand. Just you wait!&rdquo;</p><p>xxx</p><p>Crowley\nwas sprawled across his sleek leather couch, a glass of wine on the coffee\ntable beside him. The compatibility quiz was ten pages of pink paper, fill-in-the-blanks and multiple-choice\nquestions, all bound together in a neat little booklet. Crowley ticked off\nboxes with a pen so expensive it could pay his rent for a month*.</p><p>*If\nCrowley were the sort to bother with taxes. One of the perks of being a demon\nwas unlimited cash, and credit cards that smelled faintly of sulfur when the\ntransaction when through.</p><p>&ldquo;&rsquo;About\nme&rsquo;,&rdquo; he read aloud. &ldquo;&rsquo;How would I describe myself?&rsquo; Oh, you know. Cool. Fancy.\nSome might even say I&rsquo;m a rebel without a cause. Favourite pass-time? Oh, sin!\nSloth especially. Name a celebrity or fictional character you most relate to.\nThe name&rsquo;s <i>Bond</i>&hellip;Hobbies, hmm, mayhem\nand mischief, naturally. A bit of plant terrorism. Tempting angels? Does that\ncount? Better put it down just in case&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Crowley\nwas having fun with this.</p><p>Having\nhad a hand in online dating, he wasn&rsquo;t expecting much out of\nthis. Did he respect Adam? Certainly. Was he grateful for the boy stopping the\nApocalypse in its tracks? Of course. But did that mean he would be looking to a\nteenager - no matter how occultly inclined &ndash; to match him with his soul mate?\nHell&mdash;<i>somewhere,</i> no.</p><p>They\nhad to do this thing what, four, five times? He may as well have some fun with\nit. And see how well it worked, anyway.</p><p>&ldquo;&rsquo;What\ndo I want in a date?&rsquo; Ooh, let me see. Cool, sleek, devil-may-care. Hah.\nFashionable of course. Expensive! I don&rsquo;t deserve anything less than the very\nfinest&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>xxx</p><p>Aziraphale\nhad a much harder time filling out the quiz.</p><p>For\none, the angel was having trouble wrapping head around the whole thing. A\nromantic partner? He&rsquo;d spent thousands of years reading about humans and their\nromances and while, yes, admittedly quite a lot of it sounded very pleasant\nindeed, the rest of it seemed to be a huge mess of emotions flying every which\nway all at once. People got hurt. It could lead to blood and tears and the\noccasional stack of bodies.</p><p>It\nwas so much work! All the posturing and dressing up, struggling to make a\nfavorable impression and primping, all those strange intricate courting rituals\nthat changed every few decades for hardly any reason! Aziraphale had become\nfamiliar with many of these rituals through observance and in his literary\ncircuits, but that didn&rsquo;t mean he understood them. Or remembered which ones\nbelonged to when.</p><p>Did\nyou bring them a gift? Should he arrange for a chaperone? Was holding hands too\nforward?</p><p>He\ntried to think through some of the more recent films he&rsquo;d seen. He grimaced. </p><p>Did\nyou <i>have </i>to kiss at the end of the\ndate? Was it rude not to? What if his date tried to initiate a kiss? Or\ntried something&ndash;he shuddered&ndash;even more forward than a kiss?</p><p>Aziraphale\nwasn&rsquo;t sure what second base was, and didn&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;d like to find out*. </p><p>*He\nsuspected there may be a club and some small compact ball and someone shouting <i>foul</i>. Possibly there was a red card\ninvolved. It did not sound like a good time. </p><p>And\nif that wasn&rsquo;t enough there was the whole business of whether or not you were\neven attracted to person! It was easy enough to like someone, in a sort of\nfriendly way, but to want to do&hellip;any of <i>that</i>\nwith them?</p><p>There\nwas nothing wrong with hanky-panky. If two (or more really, it wasn&rsquo;t any of\nhis business) people wanted to get together and be intimate, that was between\nthem. So long as everything was safe and consensual, of course. </p><p>It\njust wasn&rsquo;t something Aziraphale had ever thought to go looking for. It simply\nhadn&rsquo;t come up, and Aziraphale was fine with that. What was the point of\nmeeting up with a perfect stranger and subjecting yourself to all kinds of\nunpleasantness and discomfort and resulting indigestion? </p><p>Besides,\nthere was nothing he&rsquo;d really want to do with someone that he didn&rsquo;t already do\nwith Crowley. They went out regularly. Or stayed in. Both were perfectly lovely\nin their own ways, and the angel really didn&rsquo;t mind so much at all when Crowley\nfell asleep on him. Aziraphale had a hard time imagining any of this dating\nbusiness would be more enjoyable than that. </p><p>Some\nsmall thought in the back of his mind rose up, trying to connect the two trains\nof thoughts respectfully named &lsquo;Crowley&rsquo; and &lsquo;dating&rsquo;. Aziraphale frowned. Yes,\nthe faster this whole dating business was over with, the sooner he could meet\nup with Crowley and tell him all about these terrible dates. The small thought\nsunk back down, pushed aside for the moment but still there, lurking just below\nthe surface.</p><p>His\neyes scanned the quiz in resignation.</p><p>&ldquo;What\ndo I want in a suitor? Oh&hellip;perhaps someone who can appreciate books&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Xxx</p><p>Crowley\nstared at his date across the restaurant they had agreed to meet at. </p><p>The demon looked like a vampire. And not the classic gothic kind. Malaphar fell somewhere\nbetween <i>Twilight</i> heart-throb and the models\non the fronts of glossy men&rsquo;s fashion magazines. </p><p>Tall,\nattractive, not a hair out of place, he wore a suit so sharp it made even\nCrowley feel like a slob. His gaze swept coolly over the room and landed on Crowley.\nCrowley gave a little wave. The corner of Malaphar&rsquo;s lip curled.</p><p>Oh\nfor someone&rsquo;s sake. He was out of his depth.</p><p>&ldquo;Hi,&rdquo;\nsaid Crowley smoothly as the other demon neared their table. He flashed a\nwinning grin. &ldquo;Glad you could make it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes.\nSuppose you are.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;S<i>o</i>,&rdquo; began Crowley after a long\nuncomfortable minute of silence. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s your gig, then?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Damning\nhumanity to the unending torment of Hell,&rdquo; was the flat reply. Malaphar wasn&rsquo;t looking\nat him, his attention absorbed in the wine menu.</p><p>&ldquo;Well\nyeah. Obviously,&rdquo; floundered Crowley. &ldquo;I mean, what&rsquo;s your, y&rsquo;know, angle?&rdquo;</p><p>Malaphar\nglanced sharply up at him. &ldquo;I suggest taking more time to think before opening\nyour mouth. Maybe you wouldn&rsquo;t waste so many words trying to get to the point.&rdquo;</p><p>Crowley&rsquo;s\neyes widened, struck speechless.</p><p><i>Aziraphale would </i>never <i>insult me like that,</i> he thought.<i> He lets me blabber all I like.</i></p><p>Crowley lent back, crossing his arms. &ldquo;Ahh, I <i>see</i>. Well, you&rsquo;ve got the smooth, stuck-up\nbastard bit down to a tee, so congratulations.&rdquo;</p><p>They\nordered and sat in silence waiting for their meals. Crowley debated puling out\nhis phone and playing Candy Crush with the volume on full blast.</p><p>&ldquo;Here\nyou are sirs.&rdquo; The waitress laid their orders out on the table. Crowley\nsuppressed a sigh of relief at the welcome distraction. The steam rising off\nhis roast duck smelled delicious.</p><p>&ldquo;What\nis <i>that?</i>&rdquo;</p><p>Crowley\nfroze.</p><p>&ldquo;Er,\nsorry?&rdquo; asked the waitress.</p><p>&ldquo;That.&rdquo;\nMalaphar picked at the plate of impeccably prepared Lobster Thermidor with the\nexpression of someone who had just been given a dead rat on a platter.</p><p>&ldquo;The\nLobster Thermidor, sir.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And\nwhat is it doing here?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&hellip;it&rsquo;s\nwhat you ordered, sir.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Funny.\nI distinctly remember ordering the Lamb Ragu.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh,\nthat&rsquo;s&hellip;&rdquo;she checked her notebook where she had written it down. No human would\nhave noticed the slight tendril of power twisting out and wrapping around it.\nCrowley did.</p><p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I\nam so sorry, sir. I&rsquo;ll be right back with your order.&rdquo;</p><p>Malaphar\nwatched her leave impassively, a slight sneer on his face. He turned back to\nCrowley as if nothing had happened. &ldquo;Humans are so easy to break, aren&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Uh.\nYe-yeah.&rdquo; </p><p>Crowley\nhad quite lost his appetite.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve\nbeen up here so long,&rdquo; mused the other demon. &ldquo;Surely you must have some\nextraordinary feats of evil to your name?&rdquo;</p><p>The\nquestion hung in the air between them like a challenge.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh,\nyou wouldn&rsquo;t believe all of what I&rsquo;ve done,&rdquo; said Crowley smoothly. &ldquo;It would\ntake too much time to even list it all.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Try\nme.&rdquo;</p><p>Their\nwaitress came back, balancing a plate of Lamb Ragu.</p><p>Crowley\nsaw the exact moment she began to trip, Malaphar making a slight movement with\nhis hand. </p><p><i>Oh no you don&rsquo;t, you bastard!</i></p><p><i>CRASH</i></p><p>&ldquo;Oh,\noh I am so sorry!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You\nknow,&rdquo; said Crowley. &ldquo;I think red is your colour.&rdquo;</p><p>Malaphar\nglowered darkly at him, his immaculate suit covered in creamy tomato sauce. He\nstood in one towering movement.</p><p>&ldquo;Your\nmanager will be hearing about this,&rdquo; he hissed to the distraught waitress,\nbefore storming out the restaurant. Crowley watched him in satisfaction.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh. Oh no.&rdquo; The poor waitress looked close to tears.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t\nworry about it,&rdquo; said Crowley, quickly wiping the last minute from the minds of everyone in the room. He cleaned up the mess with a wave of his hand. </p><p>&ldquo;Ah.&rdquo;\nThat waitress stared at him blankly. &ldquo;Sorry?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Just\nthe bill, thanks.&rdquo; He smiled at her. &ldquo;Great service here. You&rsquo;re doing a\nmarvelous job.&rdquo;</p><p>Xxx</p><p>Aziraphale\nmet Pravuil at a small caf&eacute;.</p><p>He\nwas nervous, but had been put a bit at ease when he remembered she was an angel that worked in\nHeaven&rsquo;s archives. Surely they would have something in common?</p><p>&ldquo;Hullo,&rdquo;\nhe greeted the other angel pleasantly. </p><p>&ldquo;Aziraphale?&rdquo;\nshe eyed him. Pravuil had taken the form of a stern looking woman, her\nclothes neat and practical and immaculately pressed. Aziraphale thought she had\nthe look of a librarian about her and was cheered.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes,\nyes. You must be Pravuil.&rdquo; He held out his hand. &ldquo;How nice to meet you.&rdquo;</p><p>Pravuil\nstared at his hand uncomprehendingly. He lowered it guiltily.</p><p>&ldquo;Sorry.\nIt&rsquo;s a human custom.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Is\nit?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh\nyes. Shall we order?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Just tea for me. I don&rsquo;t eat.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t&mdash;?&rdquo;\nAziraphale floundered. He couldn&rsquo;t imagine a world without food. It was\na terrible, lonely thought. &ldquo;Not even a little?&rdquo; he tried a desperately.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Never.\nIt&rsquo;s too messy.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ah.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I\nwork with very delicate documents,&rdquo; she said as they got in line.</p><p>Aziraphale\nmade an understanding noise. &ldquo;Oh yes. I suppose I know what you mean. I have a\nmodest collection of rare books myself. I won&rsquo;t have anyone coming near them\nwith food.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Does\nthat happen?&rdquo; asked Pravuil with something approaching alarm. &ldquo;Is that\nsomething humans do?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sometimes.\nBut I send them running.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I\nshould hope so!&rdquo;</p><p>They\nsat down at a small table, a chai tea and a mug of hot cocoa set in front of\nthem respectfully. Aziraphale worried the handle of his mug, gazing down at the\nslowly melting marshmallows floating on the surface of his drink. He was\nfeeling rather peckish, but thought it might be rude to eat something if\nPravuil was against it. His belly rumbled gently.</p><p>&ldquo;Do\nyou get time for much reading? Up there?&rdquo; asked Aziraphale, trying to &nbsp;distract himself.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;\nShe took a sip of her tea. &ldquo;I get every seventh day off. I usually spend it in\nthe library.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s\na marvelous library, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; Aziraphale would visit heaven&rsquo;s library when he\nwas stuck waiting for a new corporation. It was perhaps his favourite place Up\nThere, though he couldn&rsquo;t say it was his favourite library.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes.\nIt is.&rdquo;</p><p>They\nsat in silence. Aziraphale wondered if he was doing something wrong or if this\nwas just what dating was like.</p><p>&ldquo;What\nhave you been reading lately?&rdquo; he asked after a while.<br /></p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;I\nhave an interest in the art of sigil making.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Wonderful!\nSo have I!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What have you read about it?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Aziraphale\nfinally thought things were going well. They talked for a few minutes pleasantly enough.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Of\ncourse, sometimes I really enjoy settling down with a good novel,&rdquo; he said, taking a sip of his cocoa. &ldquo;Have you ever\nread Wilde? He was a particular friend of mine.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Fiction?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p><p>She\nsniffed, something in her expression closing off. &ldquo;No. I can&rsquo;t see the point in it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t\nsee the&hellip;&rdquo; Aziraphale was at a loss.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s\njust made up things.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;Aziraphale felt as if someone had pulled the rug out from under him.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Yes\nbut, but, that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s so fantastic about it,&rdquo; he said, trying to recover. &ldquo;The worlds people create, the\ncharacters! The sweeping themes and beautiful phrases of prose. They put so\nmuch into these stories, so much heart and soul. I would even go so far to say\nstories are one of the greatest achievements of humankind.&rdquo;</p><p>Pravuil finished her tea. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say I care for all that. It&rsquo;s written by humans.\nWhat do they know?&rdquo;</p><p>Five\nminutes later Aziraphale and Pravuil politely said goodbye to each other,\nmutually relived the interaction was over.</p><p>Xxx</p><p>That\nwas bloody awful! </p><p>Crowley\ngot home, angrily undoing his tie and throwing it across the room. What a twat!</p><p>Of\ncourse, Crowley himself was a demon. But while he knew it was his job to mess\nwith greedy, corruptible bastards it didn&rsquo;t mean he enjoyed hanging out with\nthem! Bleugh! <br /></p><p>Surely\nAziraphale could be a bit of a bastard sometimes, but he was just <i>enough</i> of one to be likeable! He was a\nbastard in all the right ways, enough to be interesting and petty and enduring\nand none of the ways that were downright cruel. </p><p>He\nflopped lengthwise onto his couch, feet up on the armrest. </p><p>There\nwas a flash of light followed by a neat stack of papers landing softly on his\nchest.</p><p>He\nlooked at it wearily.</p><p>It\nwas the damn quiz.</p><p>He\ngave the sigh of the long suffering.</p><p>Only\nfour more to go. </p><p>He\nopened the papers and skimmed them. Well. This time he wouldn&rsquo;t ask for someone\nsleek and cool. Crowley was more than cool enough for two. And this time&hellip;maybe&hellip;</p><p>He\ngave a surreptitious glance around the room. He bit his lip. </p><p>Almost\nguiltily he bent to the preferences sheet and ticked off &lsquo;Compassionate&rsquo; and\n&lsquo;Empathetic&rsquo;&hellip;</p><p>Xxx</p><p>Aziraphale\nwas pacing. Back and forth across the floor of his bookshop he walked, absently\nstepping over stacks of books and weaving around boxes that got in his path.</p><p>He\nhad come to the conclusion that his date with Pravuil had gone&hellip;not terribly.</p><p>She\nhad a very high esteem of books, which was something Aziraphale always approved\nof. But they hadn&rsquo;t really got on. It had been such an effort. It wasn&rsquo;t at all\nlike meeting Crowley for lunch. They could talk for hours about anything and\neverything, or sit silently, and somehow it still felt comfortable.</p><p>Aziraphale\nsighed, and slowed to a halt. He looked down at the new quiz in his hands and\nresisted the urge to sigh again.</p><p>What\ndid he want in a partner?</p><p>He\nneeded someone with an interest in the earth. He needed someone with a <i>spark</i>,\nwith a certain&hellip;<br /></p><p>The\nangle snapped his fingers. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it!&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;He\nhurried over to his desk and scrambled about for a pen.</p><p>&ldquo;Must\nhave a sense of humor&hellip;&rdquo; he wrote.</p>",
