Shortly after he and the family arrive at their new house, his eccentric boss, Hank Scorpio, shows up to greet them. He talks about his moccasins and tells Homer he left him a pair, but if Homer doesn\u2019t like them, then neither does he. He takes his moccasins off and tosses them away.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"2480\" data-orig-height=\"1839\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/ed5a2583b0e785c3f51f5bcf3d14dd12/tumblr_inline_povz3ocYd71vlsl45_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"2480\" data-orig-height=\"1839\"/></figure><p>This exchange, which lasts all of five seconds, has \n led to years upon years of furious debate on the internet, which is weird because normally the internet just lets stuff go.\n\n<br/></p><p>What did Homer mean? Did he say \u201cYes, once\u201d because he just saw that very thing happen moments ago and the joke is about him being stupid? Did he mean he saw that same thing happen prior to that day and the joke is about the randomness of life?<br/></p><p>The whole thing is so vague and absurd that the answer isn\u2019t clear and both choices can be considered workable solutions.</p><p>Why do I bring this up?<br/></p><p>Because I believe <i>Andi Mack</i> has a similarly ambiguous joke.</p><p>One which has caused a lot of strife.</p><p>One which has been on my mind for well over a year.</p><p>One which I determined I needed an answer to.</p><p>This called for an investigation. And not just any \ninvestigation. A cool, trendy, documentary series-style \ninvestigation, with multiple parts split up by stylish titles.</p><p>After half a year of research &ndash; reviewing hours and hours of tape, conducting hundreds of interviews, and reading some notes &ndash; I believe I may have found an answer.<br/></p><figure data-orig-width=\"1168\" data-orig-height=\"718\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/1abaddbc29cfadf7f0510c4620ebfeae/tumblr_inline_pouwvn4gJ51vlsl45_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1168\" data-orig-height=\"718\"/></figure><figure data-orig-width=\"1168\" data-orig-height=\"718\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/7ad0821e1e18a1c0131f804e110bb8df/tumblr_inline_pouwvyHqeN1vlsl45_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1168\" data-orig-height=\"718\"/></figure><p>This whole mystery begins back in episode four of season two. Titled \u201cMama,\u201d the episode was directed by Eyal Gordon and written by series creator Terri Minsky herself.<br/></p><p>In a scene that occurs about midway through the episode, Jonah teaches Cyrus how to skateboard and he says, \u201cYou\u2019re one of a kind, Cyrus.\u201d</p><p>To which Cyrus responds&hellip;</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1570\" data-orig-height=\"883\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/4187f95aa416641eeb94b4d7cd753e03/tumblr_inline_pow7klXAOH1vlsl45_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1570\" data-orig-height=\"883\"/></figure><p>Stop and think about this for a second. What exactly is the meaning behind this joke?<br/></p><p>I believe before we can begin to investigate any possibilities, we have to first look at the definition of the word \u201cdoppelg\u00e4nger.\u201d And the best way to do that is to go to the source.<br/></p><p>One of the earliest English dictionaries ever produced is <i>A Table Alphabeticall</i>, published in London in the year 1604 and written by Robert Cawdrey. There are no known images of Robert Cawdrey so I made one.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"829\" data-orig-height=\"642\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/9f0d109b9e754bf7f6d392642dc98ac7/tumblr_inline_powabkjt5j1vlsl45_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"829\" data-orig-height=\"642\"/></figure><p>Cawdrey\u2019s dictionary still exists today. It is kept in the Bodleian Library at the University of Oxford.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"2995\" data-orig-height=\"1660\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/8981ef01eb8d8728550b06e065680d25/tumblr_inline_pph2v1SZb71vlsl45_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"2995\" data-orig-height=\"1660\"/></figure><p>Now, I\u2019m not a professional investigator, but having watched quite a few of these documentaries, I knew the best move was to always follow your instincts. So I followed <i>my</i> investigator\u2019s instincts and booked a first-class ticket on a non-stop flight to England to see the dictionary.</p><p>Well imagine my surprise and disgust when the stuffy librarians at Oxford wouldn\u2019t let me handle the dictionary <i>or</i> highlight the passages I wanted. \nI tried to explain to them what tumblr was and they didn\u2019t get it.\nThey told me I couldn\u2019t have their precious little dictionary even after I told them I came all the way from America for this! <br/></p><p>And then someone started trying to tell me that Cawdrey\u2019s dictionary was published almost 200 years before the invention of the word \u201cdoppelg\u00e4nger,\u201d so even if I could dig through <i>A Table Alphabeticall</i>, I wouldn\u2019t find it in there. Let me tell you, I did not take that well. There was a lot of yelling on both ends and then they called security on me.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"829\" data-orig-height=\"642\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/1d668c6f5a91e2f53c54eed1829d8216/tumblr_inline_pph3klUQOE1vlsl45_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"829\" data-orig-height=\"642\"/></figure><p>Long story short, I returned to America $12,000 in the hole and no closer to solving the mystery.<br/></p><p>Once back in America, I decided to go to the Merriam-Webster website and look up the definition and take a screenshot of it.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"651\" data-orig-height=\"359\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/3bfbc27458353a95e105842d09b783a0/tumblr_inline_pow8taO4sh1vlsl45_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"651\" data-orig-height=\"359\"/></figure><p>I tried to make it look old-ish though. It looks like a scan from an old book, right? Okay. Cool.<br/></p><p>Now, look at those definitions. The word \n\u201cdoppelg\u00e4nger\u201d is literally German for \u201cdouble-walker.\u201d Keep this all in mind as we move forward. We\u2019re not talking about shared interests here. We\u2019re talking about clones, we\u2019re talking about mirror images, we\u2019re talking about twins separated at birth &ndash; things of that nature.<br/></p><p>We\u2019re also talking about ghosts? I don\u2019t think this is a ghost thing though, so let\u2019s ignore the second definition.</p><p>It\u2019s also, I guess, just literally anyone who has the same name as you? That\u2019s ridiculous. So, what, every John Smith has millions of doppelg\u00e4ngers? Dumb. So dumb. Ignore that definition, too.</p><p>Let\u2019s just hone in on the one about seeing your look-alike.</p><p>So, when Cyrus says he\u2019s met his doppelg\u00e4nger, <i><b>who is he talking about?</b></i><br/></p><figure data-orig-width=\"1168\" data-orig-height=\"718\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/a7c6d989477c49cd6764f2b3ec650c6b/tumblr_inline_pouwwgOe2K1vlsl45_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1168\" data-orig-height=\"718\"/></figure><p>Fans, in discussing this joke before, had considered Iris as a possible solution.</p><p>In fact, it\u2019s sort of commonly accepted that Cyrus is\n talking about Iris because she was still a part of his life at that time \nso she could easily be on his mind, and they share a lot of similar interests.</p><p>And, frankly, she\u2019s really the only person this joke could\u2019ve been about, if it was a reference to someone we\u2019ve actually seen in the show.<br/></p><p>But let\u2019s think back to the definition of a doppelg\u00e4nger. Does that really sound like it\u2019s describing Iris? Again, this isn\u2019t about those shared interests. This isn\u2019t about how much you gel with someone. This is about seeing your visual counterpart.<br/></p><p>For a refresher, let\u2019s take a look at both characters from an earlier episode.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1535\" data-orig-height=\"852\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/6317c8397d9aa6c3235a761dafa2c164/tumblr_inline_powbzzcdFh1vlsl45_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1535\" data-orig-height=\"852\"/></figure><p>Now, the differences are subtle but I think if you really look closely you can tell they aren\u2019t doubles because they look like entirely different people.</p><p>I believe we accepted Iris as the answer because she was there. It was convenient and it allowed us to move on. But thinking about it now, it was clear that choice was just to provide us comfort. That doesn\u2019t mean it was correct. Far from it.<br/></p><p>\nSo, no, Iris clearly isn\u2019t Cyrus\u2019s doppelg\u00e4nger.\n\nAnd if that\u2019s the case, then who might he be talking about?</p><p>There <i>had</i> to be another answer. But what?</p><p>The trail went cold for several months.</p><p>Until one day I was rewatching the season two episode, \u201cFor the Last Time,\u201d and found a game-changing clue.<br/></p><figure data-orig-width=\"1168\" data-orig-height=\"718\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/5c02b24e1a4ed6720f275ab9a780398c/tumblr_inline_pouwwwMYUR1vlsl45_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1168\" data-orig-height=\"718\"/></figure><p>In \u201cFor the Last Time,\u201d Cyrus and Andi prepare a time capsule for Buffy before she moves away.</p><p>In the scene in which the two place objects into the time capsule, Andi chooses to add a picture of them at Costume Day in the 6th grade.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1561\" data-orig-height=\"880\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/69d5c2f73511b011e3ec34592f2e06a2/tumblr_inline_powct5vdXr1vlsl45_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1561\" data-orig-height=\"880\"/></figure><p>There!

After spending $2,300 on a completely new computer setup in an attempt to enhance, failing to enhance once again, and then spending two days going back and forth on the phone with IT specialists, I was told \u201cenhance\u201d was not a thing.</p><p>My inability to enhance was another tremendous blow to the investigation.<br/></p><p>Or it would have been, except that the picture appeared another time in the show, in the season one episode, \u201cTerms of Embarrassment,\u201d when Bowie put it in his video for Andi.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1273\" data-orig-height=\"714\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/f107cbdeca7f2627496a93a4b4a1d9a5/tumblr_inline_powd0mUg4I1vlsl45_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1273\" data-orig-height=\"714\"/></figure><p>Should I have started this chapter with this picture?

After weeks of research, during which I spent thousands of dollars purchasing and reviewing Blu-ray movies and television show collections, I was finally able to make an educated guess. His costume appeared to be the fictional character Bunga.</p><p>To confirm, I went looking for official Bunga costumes on the internet.</p><p>I found only these toddler-sized ones:</p><figure data-orig-width=\"966\" data-orig-height=\"539\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/ad3132de06da3bc7685c78d6f83a01e4/tumblr_inline_powd6dRR7Q1vlsl45_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"966\" data-orig-height=\"539\"/></figure><p>Not a match to Cyrus\u2019s costume. A set-back to the theory to be sure.</p><p>However, I assumed that Cyrus, since he is marginally larger than a toddler, also ran into the same problem I did and therefore had to make his own Bunga costume.</p><p>Luckily, if you were looking to make such a costume, there are a few pictures online of homemade Bunga costumes that could help guide you in the process, like this one I found from an enthusiastic fan on Pinterest.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"316\" data-orig-height=\"395\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/023fbc8e4543a1488f5e2e7917013e44/tumblr_inline_powd8h3Khj1vlsl45_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"316\" data-orig-height=\"395\"/></figure><p>Seemed like a match to Cyrus\u2019s costume.

What legal rights does that give you? Those of an uncle? What <i>are</i> those? Is that just the right to pick up your nephew from school when his parents are busy? The right to drink too much at a family gathering and start talking politics? The right to take your nephew to a horror movie he\u2019s too young to see that\u2019s going to give him nightmares for the next decade?</p><p>I interviewed several lawyers who told me Avuncular Law was not a thing.

Does that really sound like it\u2019s describing Iris? Again, this isn\u2019t about those shared interests. This isn\u2019t about how much you gel with someone. This is about seeing your visual counterpart.<br></p><p>For a refresher, let\u2019s take a look at both characters from an earlier episode.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1535\" data-orig-height=\"852\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/6317c8397d9aa6c3235a761dafa2c164/tumblr_inline_powbzzcdFh1vlsl45_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1535\" data-orig-height=\"852\"></figure><p>Now, the differences are subtle but I think if you really look closely you can tell they aren\u2019t doubles because they look like entirely different people.</p><p>I believe we accepted Iris as the answer because she was there.

His costume appeared to be the fictional character Bunga.</p><p>To confirm, I went looking for official Bunga costumes on the internet.</p><p>I found only these toddler-sized ones:</p><figure data-orig-width=\"966\" data-orig-height=\"539\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/ad3132de06da3bc7685c78d6f83a01e4/tumblr_inline_powd6dRR7Q1vlsl45_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"966\" data-orig-height=\"539\"></figure><p>Not a match to Cyrus\u2019s costume. A set-back to the theory to be sure.</p><p>However, I assumed that Cyrus, since he is marginally larger than a toddler, also ran into the same problem I did and therefore had to make his own Bunga costume.</p><p>Luckily, if you were looking to make such a costume, there are a few pictures online of homemade Bunga costumes that could help guide you in the process, like this one I found from an enthusiastic fan on Pinterest.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"316\" data-orig-height=\"395\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/023fbc8e4543a1488f5e2e7917013e44/tumblr_inline_powd8h3Khj1vlsl45_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"316\" data-orig-height=\"395\"></figure><p>Seemed like a match to Cyrus\u2019s costume.

What legal rights does that give you? Those of an uncle? What <i>are</i> those? Is that just the right to pick up your nephew from school when his parents are busy? The right to drink too much at a family gathering and start talking politics? The right to take your nephew to a horror movie he\u2019s too young to see that\u2019s going to give him nightmares for the next decade?</p><p>I interviewed several lawyers who told me Avuncular Law was not a thing. They also didn\u2019t want to go on record answering hypotheticals about talking animals adopting each other. This didn\u2019t really impede the investigation in any way, but it was wildly unsatisfying on a personal level to not get these answers.<br></p><p>Anyway, <i>The Lion Guard</i> fandom wiki tells us that some of Bunga\u2019s personality traits include: \u201c[having] a soft spot for baby animals,\u201d \u201c[being] somewhat of a \ncomedian who likes telling jokes to his friends in which they sometimes \nfind funny,\u201d and \u201calso at times, Bunga can be clever at times.\u201d</p><p>Bunga is also considered very \u201cbrave.\u201d</p><p>All told, it\u2019s easy to see why Cyrus might be drawn toward Bunga. He shares some of his lighter traits, while he also likely admires Bunga\u2019s courage.</p><p>So we know that Cyrus watches <i>The Lion Guard</i> and likes the character Bunga.<br></p><p>But what does that have to do with anything?</p><p>Well, if you dig a little deeper, here\u2019s where the connection gets interesting.

We\u2019re talking about clones, we\u2019re talking about mirror images, we\u2019re talking about twins separated at birth \u2013 things of that nature.<br></p><p>We\u2019re also talking about ghosts? I don\u2019t think this is a ghost thing though, so let\u2019s ignore the second definition.</p><p>It\u2019s also, I guess, just literally anyone who has the same name as you? That\u2019s ridiculous. So, what, every John Smith has millions of doppelg\u00e4ngers? Dumb. So dumb. Ignore that definition, too.</p><p>Let\u2019s just hone in on the one about seeing your look-alike.</p><p>So, when Cyrus says he\u2019s met his doppelg\u00e4nger, <i><b>who is he talking about?</b></i><br></p><figure data-orig-width=\"1168\" data-orig-height=\"718\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/a7c6d989477c49cd6764f2b3ec650c6b/tumblr_inline_pouwwgOe2K1vlsl45_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1168\" data-orig-height=\"718\"></figure><p>Fans, in discussing this joke before, had considered Iris as a possible solution.</p><p>In fact, it\u2019s sort of commonly accepted that Cyrus is\n talking about Iris because she was still a part of his life at that time \nso she could easily be on his mind, and they share a lot of similar interests.</p><p>And, frankly, she\u2019s really the only person this joke could\u2019ve been about, if it was a reference to someone we\u2019ve actually seen in the show.<br></p><p>But let\u2019s think back to the definition of a doppelg\u00e4nger. Does that really sound like it\u2019s describing Iris? Again, this isn\u2019t about those shared interests. This isn\u2019t about how much you gel with someone. This is about seeing your visual counterpart.<br></p><p>For a refresher, let\u2019s take a look at both characters from an earlier episode.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1535\" data-orig-height=\"852\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/6317c8397d9aa6c3235a761dafa2c164/tumblr_inline_powbzzcdFh1vlsl45_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1535\" data-orig-height=\"852\"></figure><p>Now, the differences are subtle but I think if you really look closely you can tell they aren\u2019t doubles because they look like entirely different people.</p><p>I believe we accepted Iris as the answer because she was there. It was convenient and it allowed us to move on. But thinking about it now, it was clear that choice was just to provide us comfort. That doesn\u2019t mean it was correct. Far from it.<br></p><p>\nSo, no, Iris clearly isn\u2019t Cyrus\u2019s doppelg\u00e4nger.\n\nAnd if that\u2019s the case, then who might he be talking about?</p><p>There <i>had</i> to be another answer.

What legal rights does that give you? Those of an uncle? What <i>are</i> those? Is that just the right to pick up your nephew from school when his parents are busy? The right to drink too much at a family gathering and start talking politics? The right to take your nephew to a horror movie he\u2019s too young to see that\u2019s going to give him nightmares for the next decade?</p><p>I interviewed several lawyers who told me Avuncular Law was not a thing. They also didn\u2019t want to go on record answering hypotheticals about talking animals adopting each other. This didn\u2019t really impede the investigation in any way, but it was wildly unsatisfying on a personal level to not get these answers.<br></p><p>Anyway, <i>The Lion Guard</i> fandom wiki tells us that some of Bunga\u2019s personality traits include: \u201c[having] a soft spot for baby animals,\u201d \u201c[being] somewhat of a \ncomedian who likes telling jokes to his friends in which they sometimes \nfind funny,\u201d and \u201calso at times, Bunga can be clever at times.\u201d</p><p>Bunga is also considered very \u201cbrave.\u201d</p><p>All told, it\u2019s easy to see why Cyrus might be drawn toward Bunga. He shares some of his lighter traits, while he also likely admires Bunga\u2019s courage.</p><p>So we know that Cyrus watches <i>The Lion Guard</i> and likes the character Bunga.<br></p><p>But what does that have to do with anything?</p><p>Well, if you dig a little deeper, here\u2019s where the connection gets interesting.

So I followed <i>my</i> investigator&rsquo;s instincts and booked a first-class ticket on a non-stop flight to England to see the dictionary.</p><p>Well imagine my surprise and disgust when the stuffy librarians at Oxford wouldn&rsquo;t let me handle the dictionary <i>or</i> highlight the passages I wanted. \nI tried to explain to them what tumblr was and they didn&rsquo;t get it.\nThey told me I couldn&rsquo;t have their precious little dictionary even after I told them I came all the way from America for this! <br /></p><p>And then someone started trying to tell me that Cawdrey&rsquo;s dictionary was published almost 200 years before the invention of the word &ldquo;doppelg&auml;nger,&rdquo; so even if I could dig through <i>A Table Alphabeticall</i>, I wouldn&rsquo;t find it in there. Let me tell you, I did not take that well. There was a lot of yelling on both ends and then they called security on me.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/1d668c6f5a91e2f53c54eed1829d8216/tumblr_inline_pph3klUQOE1vlsl45_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Long story short, I returned to America $12,000 in the hole and no closer to solving the mystery.<br /></p><p>Once back in America, I decided to go to the Merriam-Webster website and look up the definition and take a screenshot of it.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/3bfbc27458353a95e105842d09b783a0/tumblr_inline_pow8taO4sh1vlsl45_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>I tried to make it look old-ish though. It looks like a scan from an old book, right? Okay. Cool.<br /></p><p>Now, look at those definitions. The word \n&ldquo;doppelg&auml;nger&rdquo; is literally German for &ldquo;double-walker.&rdquo; Keep this all in mind as we move forward. We&rsquo;re not talking about shared interests here. We&rsquo;re talking about clones, we&rsquo;re talking about mirror images, we&rsquo;re talking about twins separated at birth &ndash; things of that nature.<br /></p><p>We&rsquo;re also talking about ghosts? I don&rsquo;t think this is a ghost thing though, so let&rsquo;s ignore the second definition.</p><p>It&rsquo;s also, I guess, just literally anyone who has the same name as you? That&rsquo;s ridiculous. So, what, every John Smith has millions of doppelg&auml;ngers? Dumb. So dumb. Ignore that definition, too.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s just hone in on the one about seeing your look-alike.</p><p>So, when Cyrus says he&rsquo;s met his doppelg&auml;nger, <i><b>who is he talking about?</b></i><br /></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/a7c6d989477c49cd6764f2b3ec650c6b/tumblr_inline_pouwwgOe2K1vlsl45_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Fans, in discussing this joke before, had considered Iris as a possible solution.</p><p>In fact, it&rsquo;s sort of commonly accepted that Cyrus is\n talking about Iris because she was still a part of his life at that time \nso she could easily be on his mind, and they share a lot of similar interests.</p><p>And, frankly, she&rsquo;s really the only person this joke could&rsquo;ve been about, if it was a reference to someone we&rsquo;ve actually seen in the show.<br /></p><p>But let&rsquo;s think back to the definition of a doppelg&auml;nger. Does that really sound like it&rsquo;s describing Iris? Again, this isn&rsquo;t about those shared interests. This isn&rsquo;t about how much you gel with someone. This is about seeing your visual counterpart.<br /></p><p>For a refresher, let&rsquo;s take a look at both characters from an earlier episode.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/6317c8397d9aa6c3235a761dafa2c164/tumblr_inline_powbzzcdFh1vlsl45_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Now, the differences are subtle but I think if you really look closely you can tell they aren&rsquo;t doubles because they look like entirely different people.</p><p>I believe we accepted Iris as the answer because she was there. It was convenient and it allowed us to move on. But thinking about it now, it was clear that choice was just to provide us comfort. That doesn&rsquo;t mean it was correct. Far from it.<br /></p><p>\nSo, no, Iris clearly isn&rsquo;t Cyrus&rsquo;s doppelg&auml;nger.\n\nAnd if that&rsquo;s the case, then who might he be talking about?</p><p>There <i>had</i> to be another answer. But what?</p><p>The trail went cold for several months.</p><p>Until one day I was rewatching the season two episode, &ldquo;For the Last Time,&rdquo; and found a game-changing clue.<br /></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/5c02b24e1a4ed6720f275ab9a780398c/tumblr_inline_pouwwwMYUR1vlsl45_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>In &ldquo;For the Last Time,&rdquo; Cyrus and Andi prepare a time capsule for Buffy before she moves away.</p><p>In the scene in which the two place objects into the time capsule, Andi chooses to add a picture of them at Costume Day in the 6th grade.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/69d5c2f73511b011e3ec34592f2e06a2/tumblr_inline_powct5vdXr1vlsl45_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>There!

Who &ndash; or what &ndash; was he dressed as?<br /></p><p>The hard work began again. After weeks of research, during which I spent thousands of dollars purchasing and reviewing Blu-ray movies and television show collections, I was finally able to make an educated guess. His costume appeared to be the fictional character Bunga.</p><p>To confirm, I went looking for official Bunga costumes on the internet.</p><p>I found only these toddler-sized ones:</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/ad3132de06da3bc7685c78d6f83a01e4/tumblr_inline_powd6dRR7Q1vlsl45_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Not a match to Cyrus&rsquo;s costume. A set-back to the theory to be sure.</p><p>However, I assumed that Cyrus, since he is marginally larger than a toddler, also ran into the same problem I did and therefore had to make his own Bunga costume.</p><p>Luckily, if you were looking to make such a costume, there are a few pictures online of homemade Bunga costumes that could help guide you in the process, like this one I found from an enthusiastic fan on Pinterest.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/023fbc8e4543a1488f5e2e7917013e44/tumblr_inline_powd8h3Khj1vlsl45_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Seemed like a match to Cyrus&rsquo;s costume. The theory was back on track.<br /></p><p>All of this led to the next important question the investigation needed to answer: <b><i>who is Bunga?</i></b></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/7cb974e9485a3e4fa281449ee875b28a/tumblr_inline_pouwxkDD9t1vlsl45_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Bunga is a character from the animated TV show, <i>The Lion Guard</i>.</p><p>This is Bunga.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/50383aa316128ce054c9e884138c952d/tumblr_inline_poxpz3djl71vlsl45_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>\nAccording to one of the greatest sources of man&rsquo;s collective knowledge, <i>The Lion Guard</i> fandom wiki, Bunga is Timon and Pumbaa&rsquo;s adoptive nephew.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/da11dc9b7b8daa92ab2b543297a55976/tumblr_inline_powej9iuoL1vlsl45_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>This raises a lot of questions, not the least of which about the nature of Timon and Pumbaa&rsquo;s relationship.</p><p>Also, can you just adopt a nephew? What legal rights does that give you? Those of an uncle? What <i>are</i> those? Is that just the right to pick up your nephew from school when his parents are busy? The right to drink too much at a family gathering and start talking politics? The right to take your nephew to a horror movie he&rsquo;s too young to see that&rsquo;s going to give him nightmares for the next decade?</p><p>I interviewed several lawyers who told me Avuncular Law was not a thing. They also didn&rsquo;t want to go on record answering hypotheticals about talking animals adopting each other. This didn&rsquo;t really impede the investigation in any way, but it was wildly unsatisfying on a personal level to not get these answers.<br /></p><p>Anyway, <i>The Lion Guard</i> fandom wiki tells us that some of Bunga&rsquo;s personality traits include: &ldquo;[having] a soft spot for baby animals,&rdquo; &ldquo;[being] somewhat of a \ncomedian who likes telling jokes to his friends in which they sometimes \nfind funny,&rdquo; and &ldquo;also at times, Bunga can be clever at times.&rdquo;</p><p>Bunga is also considered very &ldquo;brave.&rdquo;</p><p>All told, it&rsquo;s easy to see why Cyrus might be drawn toward Bunga. He shares some of his lighter traits, while he also likely admires Bunga&rsquo;s courage.</p><p>So we know that Cyrus watches <i>The Lion Guard</i> and likes the character Bunga.<br /></p><p>But what does that have to do with anything?</p><p>Well, if you dig a little deeper, here&rsquo;s where the connection gets interesting. According to IMDb, Bunga is voiced by Joshua Rush.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/05fcce5503e74fdac77b1a701609cf93/tumblr_inline_poweridIMn1vlsl45_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Now you&rsquo;re probably asking yourself the same thing I was: <i><b>who is Joshua Rush?</b></i></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/3a242f8e303e084327a983b092497320/tumblr_inline_pouwy3kuSO1vlsl45_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Joshua Rush is an actor.</p><p>According to IMDb, he&rsquo;s 5&prime;7 and a half, bilingual, and also, Alec Baldwin once played a character named Joshua Rush in the 1980s.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/56cc09fd00a46e5860bbc9264274f9d4/tumblr_inline_powf0dIifi1vlsl45_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>I don&rsquo;t know what that means.</p><p>What I do know is this: on Joshua Rush&rsquo;s IMDb page are a collection of pictures of him, and that&rsquo;s where I found the most staggering turn in the investigation yet:</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/1f8c6e43ae691bf30393987579750cad/tumblr_inline_powf6dvSyI1vlsl45_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>I let out an audible gasp upon seeing this.</p><p>Now, mind you, I&rsquo;d been so deep into researching this post at this point that hadn&rsquo;t slept in well over four days and I was on so much cough medication I forgot shapes, but this was still absolutely shocking to me.<br /></p><p>Look at these two side-by-side:</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/c4781c4e4426e86ce917fe3fff86434f/tumblr_inline_powfu0iA9W1vlsl45_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>The image on the left is a promotional still from Actor Joshua Rush&rsquo;s IMDb page, the image on the right is of Cyrus from a season one episode.<br /></p><p>Now there are obviously some slight differences, like their facial expressions or where on their shoulder they rest the strap of their satchel, but besides that, Actor Joshua Rush&rsquo;s likeness to Cyrus is stunning.<br /></p><p>In fact, you might almost say he&rsquo;s a mirror-image, a double, a&hellip; \n<i>doppelg&auml;nger?</i></p><p>So that leaves us with the final question to be answered: <b><i>has Cyrus Goodman met Actor Joshua Rush?</i></b></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d6d298308b1333fe7f32134fb90cc00f/tumblr_inline_pouwyhEyrZ1vlsl45_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Picture, if you would, a voice actor meet and greet.

Maybe they shake hands. Maybe Cyrus says something nice about his acting ability. Cyrus notes their similarities in his mind. <i>Wow!

Salinger or Daniel Day-Lewis or Joffrey from <i>Game of Thrones</i>. Very quiet, reserved.\nProbably lives on farm somewhere.\n\nNo social media accounts or anything like that. Definitely not the type to troll an entire fandom on tumblr with incomprehensible emoji clues.

Things were worse than the gun situation because even though Cyrus hadn\u2019t been talking to him then, the silent treatment hadn\u2019t gone for so long and it wasn\u2019t his choice either. TJ\u2019s sent text, after text, after text and all he\u2019s gotten back nothing but silence except the one time Cyrus had replied asking for space.</p><p>What did that even mean?</p><p>TJ hadn\u2019t noticed it before but Cyrus was his only real friend or friend at all. He hadn\u2019t had a problem with it before, Reed and Lester weren\u2019t great influences on him and the guys on the team only talk to him because he\u2019s captain. It was cool though, he\u2019d rather have one real friend like Cyrus than hang out with people who he never really feels himself around. But he didn\u2019t have Cyrus anymore and to be frank TJ felt overwhelmingly lonely.</p><p>He sat up in his recently made up bed, rustling the bedsheets in the process and hit send on the message he just typed, all it took was five minutes before his phone pinged signalling a new text.</p><p><b>Jonah: </b>I don\u2019t think I\u2019m supposed to be talking to u bro</p><p><b>TJ: </b>Costume day?</p><p><b>Jonah: </b>Yeah&hellip;</p><p>TJ sighs and runs his fingers through his hair, tugging at it slightly. Cyrus must really hate him now and he didn\u2019t blame him.</p><p><b>Jonah: </b>If it helps he\u2019s not mad at u and he doesn\u2019t hate u he\u2019s just hurt</p><p>TJ thinks that may be worse. He can handle Cyrus being mad at him but knowing he hurt the only friend he has, the only person who\u2019s stuck by him even when he wasn\u2019t a great person, feels like a punch to the gut.</p><p>He thinks back on the real reason he hadn\u2019t done the costume with Cyrus and hangs his head in shame, he had let Kira\u2019s words get the better of him and because of that, he\u2019d bailed on him and Cyrus\u2019 costume, the costume he was the one to suggest. He\u2019s an idiot he probably lost the only friend he had left because he had taken Kira\u2019s words to heart.</p><p>It\u2019s just, she had looked at him like she knew, like she knew the feelings he had for Cyrus&hellip; The feelings he had for boys and he panicked because if he didn\u2019t do the costume with her she now had leverage on him and TJ isn\u2019t ready for his secret to come out.</p><p>As much as TJ would love to blame Kira for all this, there was a tiny voice in the back of his head telling him that this was his doing, he was the one who hurt Cyrus again. But TJ as much as he trusts Cyrus, he doesn\u2019t think he\u2019s ready to come out to Cyrus. He doesn\u2019t want Cyrus to hate him.</p><p>TJ stares at the wall in front of him, his eyes looking at all the posters he had of basketball players, bands and photos from family vacations before they settle on one picture. It\u2019s a Polaroid he and Cyrus had taken a month ago, it had been a pain to take because Cyrus had been laughing the whole time and kept complaining about the flash but it was TJ\u2019s favourite picture of the two.</p><p>-</p><p><i>TJ watches as Cyrus looks through his closet, commenting on every basketball hoodie he found as he went.</i></p><p><i>\u201cOh my gosh\u201d Cyrus whispers, clutching a blue hoodie to his chest.</i></p><p><i>TJ rolls his eyes and continues scrolling through his Instagram feed, \u201cI already told you, Cyrus, I don\u2019t want to hear what you have to say about my basketball hoodies. I won\u2019t stop wearing them\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou kept my bash mitzvah hoodie,\u201d Cyrus says, his face a mixture of confusion and shock as he turns to face TJ with the hoodie held up to his chest.</i></p><p><i>\u201cY-yeah\u201d TJ stutters out, avoiding eye contact with Cyrus.</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhy?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cIt\u2019s got your face on it\u201d He blurts out, groaning in embarrassment when his bed dips slightly from the added weight.</i></p><p><i>Cyrus shoves him playfully, \u201cYou\u2019re obsessed with me\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI\u2019m your number one fan\u201d TJ gushes, leaning his head onto Cyrus\u2019 shoulder and letting out a dreamy sigh. He and Cyrus give each other a knowing look and break into a fit of giggles.</i></p><p><i>\u201cRemember when you had to open the bottle of apple cider for me? That was so embarrassing\u201d Cyrus says, cringing at the thought of the memory.</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhy?\u201d TJ asks curiously.</i></p><p><i>\u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d Cyrus shrugs, \u201cI\u2019m so weak that I couldn\u2019t open a bottle of apple cider,\u201d</i></p><p><i>TJ\u2019s frown deepens, Cyrus was probably the strongest person he knew.

He&rsquo;s an idiot he probably lost the only friend he had left because he had taken Kira&rsquo;s words to heart.</p><p>It&rsquo;s just, she had looked at him like she knew, like she knew the feelings he had for Cyrus&hellip; The feelings he had for boys and he panicked because if he didn&rsquo;t do the costume with her she now had leverage on him and TJ isn&rsquo;t ready for his secret to come out.</p><p>As much as TJ would love to blame Kira for all this, there was a tiny voice in the back of his head telling him that this was his doing, he was the one who hurt Cyrus again. But TJ as much as he trusts Cyrus, he doesn&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s ready to come out to Cyrus. He doesn&rsquo;t want Cyrus to hate him.</p><p>TJ stares at the wall in front of him, his eyes looking at all the posters he had of basketball players, bands and photos from family vacations before they settle on one picture. It&rsquo;s a Polaroid he and Cyrus had taken a month ago, it had been a pain to take because Cyrus had been laughing the whole time and kept complaining about the flash but it was TJ&rsquo;s favourite picture of the two.</p><p>-</p><p><i>TJ watches as Cyrus looks through his closet, commenting on every basketball hoodie he found as he went.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Oh my gosh&rdquo; Cyrus whispers, clutching a blue hoodie to his chest.</i></p><p><i>TJ rolls his eyes and continues scrolling through his Instagram feed, &ldquo;I already told you, Cyrus, I don&rsquo;t want to hear what you have to say about my basketball hoodies. I won&rsquo;t stop wearing them&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;You kept my bash mitzvah hoodie,&rdquo; Cyrus says, his face a mixture of confusion and shock as he turns to face TJ with the hoodie held up to his chest.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Y-yeah&rdquo; TJ stutters out, avoiding eye contact with Cyrus.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s got your face on it&rdquo; He blurts out, groaning in embarrassment when his bed dips slightly from the added weight.</i></p><p><i>Cyrus shoves him playfully, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re obsessed with me&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m your number one fan&rdquo; TJ gushes, leaning his head onto Cyrus&rsquo; shoulder and letting out a dreamy sigh. He and Cyrus give each other a knowing look and break into a fit of giggles.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Remember when you had to open the bottle of apple cider for me? That was so embarrassing&rdquo; Cyrus says, cringing at the thought of the memory.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; TJ asks curiously.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&rdquo; Cyrus shrugs, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so weak that I couldn&rsquo;t open a bottle of apple cider,&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>TJ&rsquo;s frown deepens, Cyrus was probably the strongest person he knew. It didn&rsquo;t matter that he couldn&rsquo;t open his own stupid bottle of cider, because, over the last few months of being friends with Cyrus, TJ had learnt that real strength wasn&rsquo;t physical.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not weak, Cyrus. I could only open the bottle of cider because you had already loosened it for me&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Yeah&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>The two boys look at each other and smile, just a little longer than most friends age.</i></p><p><i>Cyrus was the one to break eye contact first, standing up from TJ&rsquo;s bed and continuing to look around his room.</i></p><p><i>Things went on like that for 5 minutes, with Cyrus looking at his things and commenting on the things he found interesting and TJ watching him with a smile tugging at his lips.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Teej! I didn&rsquo;t know you had one of these&rdquo; Cyrus says, turning around to face him with a bright yellow object in his hands.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Oh yeah, it was originally Ambers,&rdquo; TJ says lifting himself off his bed and approaching Cyrus to take a closer look at the Polaroid, &ldquo;Did you to take one?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Seriously?&rdquo; Cyrus exclaims excitedly, beaming at TJ.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Yeah, just - hold on a sec,&rdquo; He says, gently taking the Polaroid from Cyrus and holding it up to both of their faces.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; Cyrus cries out suddenly, giggling nervously, &ldquo;My hair&rsquo;s not ready&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>TJ smirks and quirks an eyebrow at Cyrus, &ldquo;Your hair&rsquo;s not ready?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Yup, if this is going up on your wall my hair has to be perfect. I&rsquo;m not a part of the good hair crew for nothing&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>TJ stares at Cyrus for a beat, when he gets an idea. He places the Polaroid on his desk and moves his hands towards Cyrus&rsquo; head, while he rambles on about TJ potentially becoming a member of the GHC if he lost the hair gel. When his hands are just an inch above Cyrus&rsquo; head, he brings them down and ruffles his hair, laughing when Cyrus lets out a surprised squawk.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Teej!&rdquo; Cyrus shout, batting his hand away and pouting, &ldquo;How could you?!&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I think you look nice like this&rdquo; TJ replies, smiling innocently at Cyrus.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;My hair probably looks terrible,&rdquo; Cyrus says.</i></p><p><i>TJ watches as Cyrus turns away from him and folds his hands over his chest, for a split second TJ is worried that Cyrus is upset with him, when Cyrus suddenly lets out a loud laugh, clutching onto his belly as if he&rsquo;d just heard the funniest joke ever. &nbsp;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I look like an idiot!&rdquo; He says in between laughs, leaning half of himself onto TJ.</i></p><p><i>When Cyrus&rsquo; laughter finally dies down, it starts up again when he sees himself in the mirror.</i></p><p><i>-</i></p><p>TJ is snapped out of his thoughts by his mom calling him down for dinner, but Cyrus&rsquo; laughter still rings in his ears. He smiles bitterly at the memory while clutching onto the Polaroid of him and Cyrus that he had taken off his wall just a second ago.</p><p>If Cyrus never forgives him, TJ thinks the thing he&rsquo;ll miss most is hearing him laugh.</p>",

That sight\nalone broke Cyrus\u2019 heart, leaving him with a sense of despair.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened, Buffy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know who\u2019s my soulmate,\u201d Andi cut in, her voice hoarse. </p><p>\u201cWhat? How do you know? That\u2019s only possible if,\u201d Cyrus\nsaid, his words trailing off as the realisation hit him. <i>Oh no. Oh god.</i></p><p>\u201cAndi,\u201d Cyrus whispered, huddling close to Andi, wrapping his\nhand around her other shoulder.</p><p>\u201cAndi, I\u2019m so sorry,\u201d TJ said, moving to sit beside Cyrus as\nhe grabbed her hand.</p><p>\u201cIt was Amber. She\u2019s my soulmate. Of course, she is. We were\nhanging out today and while walking back, we were having a debate about which ice\ncream flavour is the best. I know, so stupid,\u201d she said, noting the slight\nsmile on Buffy\u2019s face. </p><p><i>\u201cMint chocolate chip is obviously the best,\u201d Andi said,\nlooking over at Amber as they walked back, hand in hand.</i></p><p><i>\u201cUh, I think not? Definitely not if butterscotch exists,\u201d\nAmber replied, smiling at Andi.</i></p><p><i>Andi couldn\u2019t believe her luck. There she was, walking\nwith arguably one of the most beautiful girls in the world, who also happened\nto like her back? It was all so perfect. But of course, there was a catch.\nAlways was.</i></p><p><i>\u201cI mean, yeah. Sure. Butterscotch is great. But mint chocolate\nchip!\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI don\u2019t even really like mint choco chip.\u201d</i></p><p><i>That made Andi turn abruptly, her face one of mock\noffence.</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou don\u2019t like the most incredible ice cream flavour to\never exist? Amber how could you?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cHey! Don\u2019t blame me for being human!\u201d </i></p><p><i>The two laughed as Andi reached her door. As she opened\nit, she leaned in and gave Amber a kiss on the cheek, sending the other girl\nblushing deeply.</i></p><p><i>\u201cSo,\u201d Amber started, her voice low. \u201cDo you think we\ncould do this again sometime?\u201d</i></p><p><i>Andi smiled softly, unable to believe her incredible\nluck. \u201cOnly if you admit mint chocolate chip is the superior flavour.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cNever!\u201d</i></p><p><i>Andi gasped, holding her hand to her chest in classic\ndramatic fashion. \u201cHow can I ever be with someone who doesn\u2019t like mint chocolate\nchip?\u201d</i></p><p><i>As Amber walked away, she lifted her arms and yelled, \u201cI\u2019m\nsorry!\u201d as she ran down the street.</i></p><p><i>\u201cSure!\u201d Andi called back, excited to see the girl the\nnext day.</i></p><p><i>It would never come.</i></p><p>\u201cI only realised it 10 minutes later.\u201d</p><p>Andi showed the three her wrist. The word and numbers which\nused to be a solid black were now just a soft grey. Cyrus and Buffy rested\ntheir heads on Andi\u2019s shoulders and TJ gave her hand a comforting squeeze. They\nsat like that in silence, only interrupted by Andi\u2019s choked sobs. </p><p>\u201cWell, one good thing came from this,\u201d Andi said, looking at\nBuffy, whose eyes were filled up, tears threatening to fall. \u201cYou\u2019re not alone\nanymore, Buffy.\u201d</p><p>That statement broke Buffy, and she and Andi clung onto each\nother, both sobbing uncontrollably. TJ and Cyrus sat there, trying to comfort\nthem. They just held each other, letting the two girls cry. Just then, Bex\nwalked in, carrying a whole pizza. </p><p>\u201cHey Andi, here you go. And so you know, I\u2019m here when\nyou\u2019re ready to talk, okay?\u201d she said, setting down the pizza. She kissed\nAndi\u2019s forehead, and left, not without giving one last concerned glance back.</p><p>All the while, Cyrus\u2019 head was spinning. All the lightness\nand happiness he felt from his day with TJ melted away, leaving ugly fear and terror\nin its place. The thing he had been trying to beat back with all his might ever\nsince getting close to TJ, the thing that made his nights since his birthday\nsleepless, he had almost forgotten it. But now, it came back, its claws\nwrapping themselves around his heart, making it pound in his chest. \u00a0He, Buffy and TJ stayed for a while, at least\nuntil Andi\u2019s sobs reduced to simply tears streaming down her face. She and\nBuffy just held onto each other, while Cyrus and TJ just comforted the two.\nAfter a while, Andi and Buffy decided to go back inside, carrying the pizza\nwith them. Cyrus and TJ decided to leave them to it, walking from Andi\u2019s house\nback home. The weather outside had worsened, what started as a light drizzle\nwas a steady downpour.</p><p>They walked in silence, neither having an umbrella. They\nwere both getting drenched. This time, the silence was tense. TJ sensed\nsomething was wrong with Cyrus but he couldn\u2019t see what. And it bothered him\nthat he couldn\u2019t help him.</p><p>A few more minutes of silence and TJ just couldn\u2019t take it\nanymore.</p><p>\u201cCan you tell me what\u2019s wrong, Underdog? Please? I can\u2019t\nstand seeing you this way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Cyrus said, his voice tense,\nas he stopped to turn to TJ.</p><p>\u201cLike this! You\u2019ve been tense after we left Andi Shack, and\nyou aren\u2019t even talking to me! And I don\u2019t know what to do!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p><p>TJ groaned, running his fingers through his hair. \u201cCyrus,\nplease. Just talk to me. You trust me right?\u201d</p><p>The way TJ said those words really hit Cyrus, but he tried\nto steel his nerves. He was just further reminded of the fact that any day, TJ\ncould say the word on his left shoulder, and would leave, never to return. He\nhad to protect himself.</p><p>\u201cTJ, I, I can\u2019t do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis!\u201d Cyrus exclaimed, gesturing to the both of them. \u201cI\ncan\u2019t do this! I can\u2019t risk getting close to you in that way. Because then that\nmeans that if one day, you leave, you may never come back!\u201d</p><p>TJ remained silent, in shock. Cyrus didn\u2019t notice and\ncontinued.</p><p>\u201cThis whole soulmate thing is bullshit! Because ever since\nmy birthday, ever since I got my marks, I haven\u2019t stopped worrying. I can\u2019t\ndeal with ever having to find out who my soulmate is, only to never see them or\ntalk to them ever again. I can\u2019t do goodbyes. Especially with you.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus\u2019 voice broke, tears that he had held back at Andi\u2019s\nstarting to flow. \u00a0His tears mixed with\nthe rain falling on his face.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why I keep running from you. I don\u2019t even want to\nimagine saying goodbye to you, TJ. So, I have to do this. I have to go.\u201d</p><p>TJ couldn\u2019t believe what he was hearing. <i>Cyrus was scared\nof losing him.</i> That hit him hard, as he knew his one fear was losing Cyrus.\nHe couldn\u2019t even think about that ever happening. The rain filled the silence\nbetween them, Cyrus heaving, trying to control his sobs. </p><p>\u201cCyrus,\u201d TJ said tentatively, stepping forward. \u201cYou won\u2019t\nlose me, okay? I\u2019m right here.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus started to shake his head and walk away, but TJ\ngrabbed his hand and pulled Cyrus to him, lifting his head by his chin. \u201cHey,\nhey. You are so important to me. You think you\u2019re the only one with a fear? Of\ncourse not, Cyrus. I\u2019m scared too. And you know what I\u2019m scared of?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus looked timidly at TJ, seeing the way the boy was growing\nincreasingly nervous.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m scared of losing you. God, that\u2019s the worst thought\never, losing you. I can\u2019t even bear to think about it. I care about you, I\nalways want you in my life. And I like you so much. We will never have to say\ngoodbye, okay?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus just looked at him, the rain slightly clouding his\nvision. </p><p>TJ put both his hands on Cyrus\u2019 cheeks. \u201cI\u2019m right here.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus let out a breath he didn\u2019t know he had been holding.\nThey realised soon the space between them was minuscule. Cyrus\u2019 heart began to\nbeat fast, his mind forgetting all fears as he felt only one thing at that\nmoment. </p><p>TJ began to move slightly. \u201cCyrus, I-\u201d</p><p>But before he could move, Cyrus grabbed his face and\nconnected their lips. </p><p>It was perfect. There may not have been fireworks, but the warmth\nthat spread through Cyrus\u2019 heart as he held onto TJ, kissing him, was\neverything he could have ever imagined. He had always wanted to kiss the person\nhe liked in the rain, and he was so glad it was TJ. TJ was initially caught by\nsurprise, but soon wrapped his hands around Cyrus\u2019 waist, pulling him even\ncloser if possible. They kissed for what felt like an eternity, the rain\npouring around them. It felt like a century had passed until they had to pull\naway for air.</p><p>AS they pulled away, they started giggling, and hugged. They\nheld onto each other as if they were all they had. And as the rain fell down\naround them, Cyrus heard TJ whisper in his ear, \u201cI\u2019ve got you, Muffin.\u201d</p><p>And he knew that it was true.</p><p>~~~~~</p><p><b>zoinkers we are on the homestretch people. only 3 more chapters to go.</b></p><p><b>hope you guys liked this chapter! its easily my favourite chapter i have written for this fic. hope you like it!</b></p>",

But of course, there was a catch.\nAlways was.</i></p><p><i>\u201cI mean, yeah. Sure. Butterscotch is great. But mint chocolate\nchip!\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI don\u2019t even really like mint choco chip.\u201d</i></p><p><i>That made Andi turn abruptly, her face one of mock\noffence.</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou don\u2019t like the most incredible ice cream flavour to\never exist? Amber how could you?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cHey! Don\u2019t blame me for being human!\u201d </i></p><p><i>The two laughed as Andi reached her door. As she opened\nit, she leaned in and gave Amber a kiss on the cheek, sending the other girl\nblushing deeply.</i></p><p><i>\u201cSo,\u201d Amber started, her voice low. \u201cDo you think we\ncould do this again sometime?\u201d</i></p><p><i>Andi smiled softly, unable to believe her incredible\nluck. \u201cOnly if you admit mint chocolate chip is the superior flavour.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cNever!\u201d</i></p><p><i>Andi gasped, holding her hand to her chest in classic\ndramatic fashion. \u201cHow can I ever be with someone who doesn\u2019t like mint chocolate\nchip?\u201d</i></p><p><i>As Amber walked away, she lifted her arms and yelled, \u201cI\u2019m\nsorry!\u201d as she ran down the street.</i></p><p><i>\u201cSure!\u201d Andi called back, excited to see the girl the\nnext day.</i></p><p><i>It would never come.</i></p><p>\u201cI only realised it 10 minutes later.\u201d</p><p>Andi showed the three her wrist. The word and numbers which\nused to be a solid black were now just a soft grey. Cyrus and Buffy rested\ntheir heads on Andi\u2019s shoulders and TJ gave her hand a comforting squeeze. They\nsat like that in silence, only interrupted by Andi\u2019s choked sobs. </p><p>\u201cWell, one good thing came from this,\u201d Andi said, looking at\nBuffy, whose eyes were filled up, tears threatening to fall. \u201cYou\u2019re not alone\nanymore, Buffy.\u201d</p><p>That statement broke Buffy, and she and Andi clung onto each\nother, both sobbing uncontrollably. TJ and Cyrus sat there, trying to comfort\nthem. They just held each other, letting the two girls cry. Just then, Bex\nwalked in, carrying a whole pizza. </p><p>\u201cHey Andi, here you go. And so you know, I\u2019m here when\nyou\u2019re ready to talk, okay?\u201d she said, setting down the pizza. She kissed\nAndi\u2019s forehead, and left, not without giving one last concerned glance back.</p><p>All the while, Cyrus\u2019 head was spinning. All the lightness\nand happiness he felt from his day with TJ melted away, leaving ugly fear and terror\nin its place. The thing he had been trying to beat back with all his might ever\nsince getting close to TJ, the thing that made his nights since his birthday\nsleepless, he had almost forgotten it. But now, it came back, its claws\nwrapping themselves around his heart, making it pound in his chest. \u00a0He, Buffy and TJ stayed for a while, at least\nuntil Andi\u2019s sobs reduced to simply tears streaming down her face. She and\nBuffy just held onto each other, while Cyrus and TJ just comforted the two.\nAfter a while, Andi and Buffy decided to go back inside, carrying the pizza\nwith them. Cyrus and TJ decided to leave them to it, walking from Andi\u2019s house\nback home. The weather outside had worsened, what started as a light drizzle\nwas a steady downpour.</p><p>They walked in silence, neither having an umbrella. They\nwere both getting drenched. This time, the silence was tense. TJ sensed\nsomething was wrong with Cyrus but he couldn\u2019t see what. And it bothered him\nthat he couldn\u2019t help him.</p><p>A few more minutes of silence and TJ just couldn\u2019t take it\nanymore.</p><p>\u201cCan you tell me what\u2019s wrong, Underdog? Please? I can\u2019t\nstand seeing you this way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Cyrus said, his voice tense,\nas he stopped to turn to TJ.</p><p>\u201cLike this! You\u2019ve been tense after we left Andi Shack, and\nyou aren\u2019t even talking to me! And I don\u2019t know what to do!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p><p>TJ groaned, running his fingers through his hair. \u201cCyrus,\nplease. Just talk to me. You trust me right?\u201d</p><p>The way TJ said those words really hit Cyrus, but he tried\nto steel his nerves. He was just further reminded of the fact that any day, TJ\ncould say the word on his left shoulder, and would leave, never to return. He\nhad to protect himself.</p><p>\u201cTJ, I, I can\u2019t do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis!\u201d Cyrus exclaimed, gesturing to the both of them. \u201cI\ncan\u2019t do this! I can\u2019t risk getting close to you in that way. Because then that\nmeans that if one day, you leave, you may never come back!\u201d</p><p>TJ remained silent, in shock. Cyrus didn\u2019t notice and\ncontinued.</p><p>\u201cThis whole soulmate thing is bullshit! Because ever since\nmy birthday, ever since I got my marks, I haven\u2019t stopped worrying. I can\u2019t\ndeal with ever having to find out who my soulmate is, only to never see them or\ntalk to them ever again. I can\u2019t do goodbyes. Especially with you.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus\u2019 voice broke, tears that he had held back at Andi\u2019s\nstarting to flow. \u00a0His tears mixed with\nthe rain falling on his face.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why I keep running from you. I don\u2019t even want to\nimagine saying goodbye to you, TJ. So, I have to do this. I have to go.\u201d</p><p>TJ couldn\u2019t believe what he was hearing. <i>Cyrus was scared\nof losing him.</i> That hit him hard, as he knew his one fear was losing Cyrus.\nHe couldn\u2019t even think about that ever happening. The rain filled the silence\nbetween them, Cyrus heaving, trying to control his sobs. </p><p>\u201cCyrus,\u201d TJ said tentatively, stepping forward. \u201cYou won\u2019t\nlose me, okay? I\u2019m right here.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus started to shake his head and walk away, but TJ\ngrabbed his hand and pulled Cyrus to him, lifting his head by his chin. \u201cHey,\nhey. You are so important to me. You think you\u2019re the only one with a fear? Of\ncourse not, Cyrus. I\u2019m scared too. And you know what I\u2019m scared of?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus looked timidly at TJ, seeing the way the boy was growing\nincreasingly nervous.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m scared of losing you. God, that\u2019s the worst thought\never, losing you. I can\u2019t even bear to think about it. I care about you, I\nalways want you in my life. And I like you so much. We will never have to say\ngoodbye, okay?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus just looked at him, the rain slightly clouding his\nvision. </p><p>TJ put both his hands on Cyrus\u2019 cheeks. \u201cI\u2019m right here.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus let out a breath he didn\u2019t know he had been holding.\nThey realised soon the space between them was minuscule. Cyrus\u2019 heart began to\nbeat fast, his mind forgetting all fears as he felt only one thing at that\nmoment. </p><p>TJ began to move slightly. \u201cCyrus, I-\u201d</p><p>But before he could move, Cyrus grabbed his face and\nconnected their lips. </p><p>It was perfect. There may not have been fireworks, but the warmth\nthat spread through Cyrus\u2019 heart as he held onto TJ, kissing him, was\neverything he could have ever imagined. He had always wanted to kiss the person\nhe liked in the rain, and he was so glad it was TJ. TJ was initially caught by\nsurprise, but soon wrapped his hands around Cyrus\u2019 waist, pulling him even\ncloser if possible. They kissed for what felt like an eternity, the rain\npouring around them. It felt like a century had passed until they had to pull\naway for air.</p><p>AS they pulled away, they started giggling, and hugged. They\nheld onto each other as if they were all they had. And as the rain fell down\naround them, Cyrus heard TJ whisper in his ear, \u201cI\u2019ve got you, Muffin.\u201d</p><p>And he knew that it was true.</p><p>~~~~~</p><p><b>zoinkers we are on the homestretch people. only 3 more chapters to go.</b></p><p><b>hope you guys liked this chapter! its easily my favourite chapter i have written for this fic. hope you like it!</b></p>",

There she was, walking\nwith arguably one of the most beautiful girls in the world, who also happened\nto like her back? It was all so perfect. But of course, there was a catch.\nAlways was.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I mean, yeah. Sure. Butterscotch is great. But mint chocolate\nchip!&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t even really like mint choco chip.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>That made Andi turn abruptly, her face one of mock\noffence.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t like the most incredible ice cream flavour to\never exist? Amber how could you?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Hey! Don&rsquo;t blame me for being human!&rdquo; </i></p><p><i>The two laughed as Andi reached her door. As she opened\nit, she leaned in and gave Amber a kiss on the cheek, sending the other girl\nblushing deeply.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;So,&rdquo; Amber started, her voice low. &ldquo;Do you think we\ncould do this again sometime?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Andi smiled softly, unable to believe her incredible\nluck. &ldquo;Only if you admit mint chocolate chip is the superior flavour.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Never!&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Andi gasped, holding her hand to her chest in classic\ndramatic fashion. &ldquo;How can I ever be with someone who doesn&rsquo;t like mint chocolate\nchip?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>As Amber walked away, she lifted her arms and yelled, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m\nsorry!&rdquo; as she ran down the street.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Sure!&rdquo; Andi called back, excited to see the girl the\nnext day.</i></p><p><i>It would never come.</i></p><p>&ldquo;I only realised it 10 minutes later.&rdquo;</p><p>Andi showed the three her wrist. The word and numbers which\nused to be a solid black were now just a soft grey. Cyrus and Buffy rested\ntheir heads on Andi&rsquo;s shoulders and TJ gave her hand a comforting squeeze. They\nsat like that in silence, only interrupted by Andi&rsquo;s choked sobs. </p><p>&ldquo;Well, one good thing came from this,&rdquo; Andi said, looking at\nBuffy, whose eyes were filled up, tears threatening to fall. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not alone\nanymore, Buffy.&rdquo;</p><p>That statement broke Buffy, and she and Andi clung onto each\nother, both sobbing uncontrollably. TJ and Cyrus sat there, trying to comfort\nthem. They just held each other, letting the two girls cry. Just then, Bex\nwalked in, carrying a whole pizza. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey Andi, here you go. And so you know, I&rsquo;m here when\nyou&rsquo;re ready to talk, okay?&rdquo; she said, setting down the pizza. She kissed\nAndi&rsquo;s forehead, and left, not without giving one last concerned glance back.</p><p>All the while, Cyrus&rsquo; head was spinning. All the lightness\nand happiness he felt from his day with TJ melted away, leaving ugly fear and terror\nin its place. The thing he had been trying to beat back with all his might ever\nsince getting close to TJ, the thing that made his nights since his birthday\nsleepless, he had almost forgotten it. But now, it came back, its claws\nwrapping themselves around his heart, making it pound in his chest. &nbsp;He, Buffy and TJ stayed for a while, at least\nuntil Andi&rsquo;s sobs reduced to simply tears streaming down her face. She and\nBuffy just held onto each other, while Cyrus and TJ just comforted the two.\nAfter a while, Andi and Buffy decided to go back inside, carrying the pizza\nwith them. Cyrus and TJ decided to leave them to it, walking from Andi&rsquo;s house\nback home. The weather outside had worsened, what started as a light drizzle\nwas a steady downpour.</p><p>They walked in silence, neither having an umbrella. They\nwere both getting drenched. This time, the silence was tense. TJ sensed\nsomething was wrong with Cyrus but he couldn&rsquo;t see what. And it bothered him\nthat he couldn&rsquo;t help him.</p><p>A few more minutes of silence and TJ just couldn&rsquo;t take it\nanymore.</p><p>&ldquo;Can you tell me what&rsquo;s wrong, Underdog? Please? I can&rsquo;t\nstand seeing you this way.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What are you talking about?&rdquo; Cyrus said, his voice tense,\nas he stopped to turn to TJ.</p><p>&ldquo;Like this! You&rsquo;ve been tense after we left Andi Shack, and\nyou aren&rsquo;t even talking to me! And I don&rsquo;t know what to do!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re talking about.&rdquo;</p><p>TJ groaned, running his fingers through his hair. &ldquo;Cyrus,\nplease. Just talk to me. You trust me right?&rdquo;</p><p>The way TJ said those words really hit Cyrus, but he tried\nto steel his nerves. He was just further reminded of the fact that any day, TJ\ncould say the word on his left shoulder, and would leave, never to return. He\nhad to protect himself.</p><p>&ldquo;TJ, I, I can&rsquo;t do this.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What are you talking about?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;This!&rdquo; Cyrus exclaimed, gesturing to the both of them. &ldquo;I\ncan&rsquo;t do this! I can&rsquo;t risk getting close to you in that way. Because then that\nmeans that if one day, you leave, you may never come back!&rdquo;</p><p>TJ remained silent, in shock. Cyrus didn&rsquo;t notice and\ncontinued.</p><p>&ldquo;This whole soulmate thing is bullshit! Because ever since\nmy birthday, ever since I got my marks, I haven&rsquo;t stopped worrying. I can&rsquo;t\ndeal with ever having to find out who my soulmate is, only to never see them or\ntalk to them ever again. I can&rsquo;t do goodbyes. Especially with you.&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus&rsquo; voice broke, tears that he had held back at Andi&rsquo;s\nstarting to flow. &nbsp;His tears mixed with\nthe rain falling on his face.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I keep running from you. I don&rsquo;t even want to\nimagine saying goodbye to you, TJ. So, I have to do this. I have to go.&rdquo;</p><p>TJ couldn&rsquo;t believe what he was hearing. <i>Cyrus was scared\nof losing him.</i> That hit him hard, as he knew his one fear was losing Cyrus.\nHe couldn&rsquo;t even think about that ever happening. The rain filled the silence\nbetween them, Cyrus heaving, trying to control his sobs. </p><p>&ldquo;Cyrus,&rdquo; TJ said tentatively, stepping forward. &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t\nlose me, okay? I&rsquo;m right here.&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus started to shake his head and walk away, but TJ\ngrabbed his hand and pulled Cyrus to him, lifting his head by his chin. &ldquo;Hey,\nhey. You are so important to me. You think you&rsquo;re the only one with a fear? Of\ncourse not, Cyrus. I&rsquo;m scared too. And you know what I&rsquo;m scared of?&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus looked timidly at TJ, seeing the way the boy was growing\nincreasingly nervous.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m scared of losing you. God, that&rsquo;s the worst thought\never, losing you. I can&rsquo;t even bear to think about it. I care about you, I\nalways want you in my life. And I like you so much. We will never have to say\ngoodbye, okay?&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus just looked at him, the rain slightly clouding his\nvision. </p><p>TJ put both his hands on Cyrus&rsquo; cheeks. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m right here.&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus let out a breath he didn&rsquo;t know he had been holding.\nThey realised soon the space between them was minuscule. Cyrus&rsquo; heart began to\nbeat fast, his mind forgetting all fears as he felt only one thing at that\nmoment. </p><p>TJ began to move slightly. &ldquo;Cyrus, I-&rdquo;</p><p>But before he could move, Cyrus grabbed his face and\nconnected their lips. </p><p>It was perfect. There may not have been fireworks, but the warmth\nthat spread through Cyrus&rsquo; heart as he held onto TJ, kissing him, was\neverything he could have ever imagined. He had always wanted to kiss the person\nhe liked in the rain, and he was so glad it was TJ. TJ was initially caught by\nsurprise, but soon wrapped his hands around Cyrus&rsquo; waist, pulling him even\ncloser if possible. They kissed for what felt like an eternity, the rain\npouring around them. It felt like a century had passed until they had to pull\naway for air.</p><p>AS they pulled away, they started giggling, and hugged. They\nheld onto each other as if they were all they had. And as the rain fell down\naround them, Cyrus heard TJ whisper in his ear, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got you, Muffin.&rdquo;</p><p>And he knew that it was true.</p><p>~~~~~</p><p><b>zoinkers we are on the homestretch people. only 3 more chapters to go.</b></p><p><b>hope you guys liked this chapter! its easily my favourite chapter i have written for this fic. hope you like it!</b></p>",
