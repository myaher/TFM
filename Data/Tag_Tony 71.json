Also, I made Tony sorta an asshole. Sorry not sorry</b></p><p>\t\u201c[Y/n]?\u201d</p><p>\tThe soft, agonized sound of your name coming from the Iron Man suit floating across the airport from you tore at your heart.</p><p>\tBut you didn\u2019t let your face betray your churning emotions. </p><p>\t\u201cTony&hellip;They chose their side.\u201d Steve\u2019s voice carried across the distance without a need for shouting. The strength in him bolstering your own. </p><p>\tEven though you were Tony\u2019s little sister, you did not agree with his way of handling the current issues happening within the Avengers, especially when he locked up Wanda without talking to anyone.</p><p>\tBlood may be thicker than water, and all that jazz, but you needed to stand by your beliefs. Which led to you being on the opposite side of your brother, ready to fight him.</p><p>\t\u201c[Y/n]&hellip;\u201d You felt, more than heard, the sigh your brother gave. </p><p>\tOnce more your heart pulled at you to comfort him.</p><p>\tFor so long, it had been you two against the world. A distant father who never wanted anything to do with you, a mother who tried her hardest that you barely remembered, because they had been killed during a car accident when you were still a child.</p><!-- more --><p>\tTony had raised you single handedly, and you helped build Stark Enterprise from the ground up after your brother inherited it. You had cried and screamed when the video surfaced of your brother being tortured and held captive in Afghanistan. You had been beside him when Fury approached him about the Avengers initiative. You had teased him for years about his crush on Pepper.</p><p>\tHe had held your hand when you walked to school the week after your parents deaths. He had taught you how to build your own Iron Suit. He had helped you hone your mutation. He had let your cry on his shoulder when your date stood you up and later, he took you out for ice cream after scaring the boy into apologizing. He called you as soon as he escaped and Rhodey found him in the desert. He let you handle the inner details regarding the Avengers Initiative and he was the one who talked to Fury about letting you join. He had teased you about your crush on Steve.</p><p>\t\u201cWhatever. Underoos!\u201d</p><p>\tAnd a small red bundle flew by and ripped Steve\u2019s shield out of his hands and weird white fluid stuck his hands together. </p><p>\tAnd the next thing you knew, you were running alongside Clint towards your former teammates and family member.</p><p>\tUsing your mutation, you kept Rhodey from hitting Scott as he flew through the air on one of Clint\u2019s arrows.</p><p>\tKeeping an eye on your brother and Bucky, you kept Wanda safe as she let Bucky and Steve run into the hangar where the Jet was. </p><p>\tRunning, you tried to stop the weird guy in the fursona of a cat, but a swift kick to your head knocked you to the ground.</p><p>\tGroaning, you looked up and a blurry image of a red android floated before you.</p><p>\t\u201cStay down Ms. Stark. For your own safety, please don\u2019t resist.\u201d</p><p>\tThe calm, cool, and confident voice of the previous Jarvis turned Vision, made its way into your foggy head.</p><p>\tFlopping back down, you heard the rumble of a jet and watched with a satisfied smirk as the jet flew overhead.</p><p>\tVision didn\u2019t leave your side, tilting his head at your prone self, he noticed the smirk, \u201cYou are glad that Rhodey seems to be paralyzed?\u201d</p><p>\tYou froze. Your smirk sliding off your face. You squinted at the android. The kick he had delivered to your head still messing with your eyes.</p><p>\t\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\tVision nodded slowly, no emotion on his face, \u201cIt seems Rhodey fell at a high velocity and crashed.\u201d</p><p>\tYour heart broke for your brother\u2019s best friend. The man who was a sort of Uncle to you. </p><p>\t\u201cHands in the air! Raise them up! Stay still!\u201d </p><p>\tOrders screamed through the dust settling across the airport. Men in black ops and holding rifles stormed the area.</p><p>\tAs one roughly dragged you up to your feet, you dimly registered that Scott, Clint, Sam, and Wanda were getting similar harsh treatment.</p><p>\tBut Steve and Bucky were gone. You were glad. The mission at least was somewhat a success.</p><p>\t\u201cCan I have a word with my sister?\u201d</p><p>\tVision somewhat stable now, you turned your head to see your brother, still in his Iron Man suit, his mask receded so that you could see his bruised face.</p><p>\tWincing, you steadied your feet. Staring at your brother, you saw the tired, dead look in his eyes as he looked at you.</p><p>\tThe man holding your arm leaned over and whispered so softly that Tony couldn\u2019t hear, \u201cGive me a reason to shoot your brains out you freak.\u201d Before he let go, only took a few steps back, his rifle still trained on your head.</p><p>\t\u201c[Y/n]..\u201d Tony groaned, running a hand down his face. Smearing dirt and blood.</p><p>\tYou kept your calm, your voice steady, \u201cI know what you\u2019re going to say. But I don\u2019t regret my decision. You were going to far Tony. The Accords? Really? It would be prison for people like me. We would become weapons sold out to the highest bidder. And You let that man,\u201d You spat, remembering how Ross twisted words and lied to your brother, \u201clie to you and you&hellip;the so called genius of this family, didn\u2019t look up the validity of his words!\u201d</p><p>\tTony flinched as if you had hit him. </p><p>\tHis eyes hardened and he gestured to the man standing behind you. Your arms were twisted behind your back again, the rifle pressed against your skull.</p><p>\t\u201cIt hurts me to turn you over to the government&hellip;you\u2019re still my sister&hellip;I still Love you. I hope you can come to your senses soon.\u201d </p><p>\tYour brother\u2019s words were soft. But you growled at him, your mutation flaring up before dying away as you remembered the gun at your head.</p><p>\t\u201cShut the fuck up, Tony!\u201d</p><p>\tTony stumbled. Vision catching him before he could fall.</p><p>\tYou continued, words falling like acid from your lips, all the rage and betrayal you felt coming into your tone \u201cYou don\u2019t care about me! You never cared about me! You never listened to me or my opinions! You always treated me like glass, like I would break if I so much as tripped! News flash, Tony! I\u2019m stronger than you will ever be and I\u2019m glad that Steve got Bucky out of here because you have become the Villain in this scenario!\u201d</p><p>\tYour wretched scream, that tore at your throat, was accompanied by bitter tears, both fading as you were drug aboard a plane and the gangway slowly closed, encasing you in darkness.</p><p>\tOnce away from the prying eyes of Team Tony, the black ops military men wasted no time in clipping on handcuffs to your team members.</p><p>\tBut, then they pulled you and Wanda to the other side of the plane.</p><p>\tScott pulled at his handcuffs, his eyes wide with worry, \u201cWhat are you doing to them?\u201d</p><p>\tThe men didn\u2019t respond. And then there was a click and the cold feeling of metal encasing your neck.</p><p>\tLooking over at Wanda, you saw her watching you with horror mirrored in her eyes. She had a collar on her neck, which you figured was what was around yours as well. It was blinking red.</p><p>\tWith a growl, you reached for your mutation, intending to get away from these men and escape with your team.</p><p>\tBut the minute you tried to focus your mutation, your entire body jerked as electricity was shot through you.</p><p>\tA strangled gasp left you as you fell to the floor of the plane, your elbows hitting metal, sending pain through your arms as you tried to protect your head.</p><p>\t\u201c[Y/n]!? What did you do to her!?\u201d Sam screamed, fighting against the hold of two men while another was removing his wings.</p><p>\tThe leader looked over at him with disinterested eyes, \u201cIt\u2019s a prototype. A suppressant collar that prevents them from using their mutations.\u201d He turned to look over you and Wanda, a sinister glint entering his eyes, \u201cIf I were you, I would not attempt to escape. The shocks will grow in intensity the more you try to use your freak powers.\u201d</p><p>\tPanting, you rolled over to your knees, your hands cuffed in front of you, pushing yourself to your feet, muscles straining against the tightness that the electricity had caused. </p><p>\tWanda\u2019s own handcuffed hands fluttered over you as you let your head loll onto her shoulder. Pain still jolting through your body. If that was the first shock, and if what the man said was true, you didn\u2019t want to know what the next shock would feel like. </p><p>\tThe next few hours passed in relative silence.</p><p>\tScott, Sam and Clint spoke to each other in whispers on their side of the plane, shooting you and Wanda the occasional comforting looks.</p><p>\tYou and Wanda stayed next to each other, holding onto each other\u2019s hands, grip so tight, you thought you both would lose blood circulation.</p><p>\tThe destination was kept away from you no matter how many times you asked. And each ask got you the same answer&hellip;a fist to the cheek.</p><p>\tBlood dripped from a split lip and your left eye was swollen shut by the time the drone of the engines was cut.</p><p>\t\u201cWe\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>\tMen grabbed your arms, ripping your hands away from Wanda. She whimpered, but kept quiet when you shot her a look of warning.</p><p>\tThe men stood behind her as you stood next to the man in charge, waiting for the gangway to lower. </p><p>\tAnd how you wished you weren\u2019t in the front when it did. </p><p>\tA loud roar of crashing waves reached you first before your vision computed what you were seeing.</p><p>\tA floating building. In the middle of the ocean. Rocking violently as the huge swells of sea water crashed against it.</p><p>\t\u201cNo no no nonononononono!\u201d Your words reached a fever scream as you pulled against the arms dragging you forward.</p><p>\tThe words your teammates said faded into white noise as your vision went white in terror. </p><p>\tThe ground that you were now standing on, rocking back and forth, your legs gave out on you.</p><p>\tYou didn\u2019t drop though, as the hands tightened on your arms, leaving bruises as they simply continued walking, dragging you now into the building.</p><p>\t\u201cHey! Where are we!?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cWhat is this place!?\u201d<br/>\t\u201cWe have rights!\u201d</p><p>\tThe men laughed at that. Clint scowled. </p><p>\tYou were brought back to the present as you began being dragged down stairs.</p><p>\tYour knees hitting the metal grates, new cuts and gashes and bruises appearing on your skin.</p><p>\t\u201cYou are traitors to the US Government. Prisoners of the state, and you have no rights. This is the Raft, and it will be your home until the day you die.\u201d</p><p>\tStumbling to your feet, you looked around. The floor wasn\u2019t moving as bad, but your terror was barely held back due to the knowledge that it wasn\u2019t moving as bad because you were under water.</p><p>\tRight now, you were standing before a gate, that almost looked like an airport security scanner. Beyond that, you saw a circular room, with various cells in the walls.</p><p>\tYou were dragged into the airport looking security scanner.</p><p>\tA bored looking guy stood behind a glass window, looking at a computer screen. His voice came through an intercom, \u201cStrip.\u201d</p><p>\tBaring your teeth, you lunged towards the window.</p><p>\tIgnoring the yells of Clint to stop.</p><p>\tThat was the last thing you heard as you felt a blinding pain to the back of your skull before you vision went dark as unconsciousness took over.</p><p>\t\u201c[Y/n]!\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cStop!\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cGet your hands off her!\u201d</p><p>\t\u201c[Y/n]!\u201d<br/>\t\u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cStop!\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cPlease!\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cLet her go!\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cStop!\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cWhat are you doing!?\u201d<br/>\t\u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cStop!\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cPlease!\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cPlease!\u201d<br/>\t\u201cDon\u2019t!\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cShe\u2019s unconscious!\u201d<br/>\t\u201cYou can\u2019t!\u201d<br/>\t\u201c[Y/n]&hellip;.We\u2019re sorry\u2026\u201d</p><p>\tWhen consciousness finally returned to you. The first thing you noticed was the soreness between your legs.</p><p>\tThe second was the fact that you were naked.\t</p><p>\tAnd the final thing was the amount of blood that was pooled around your sprawled body.</p><p>\t\u201cWanda?\u201d Your voice was hoarse, and you had to cough several times to clear it. \u201cWanda? Clint? Sam? Scott?\u201d</p><p>\tYou called out for your team. Looking around as you recognized a cell.</p><p>\tA single toilet and a metal bed frame decorated it. Standing up, wincing at the pain you were in, you took stock of yourself.</p><p>\tCuts littered your body. A large gash on your arm had you hissing as you saw the white muscles open to the air.</p><p>\tYour legs were shaky as you realized what had happened while you were unconscious. Bile drew up to your throat. Choking it down, you fought the urge to cry as well.</p><p>\tLimping on bare feet to the metal cell doors, you peered out. Your eye still swollen shut, your face stinging with new wounds that you couldn\u2019t see. </p><p>\t\u201cGuys?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cShe\u2019s awake!\u201d</p><p>\t\u201c[Y/n]&hellip;god. I am so sorry! I tried to get them to stop!\u201d Sam reached his hands out through his cell bars. He was directly across from you. Clint and Scott on either side, you could barely make out their faces as the cells curved. You noticed that they were still wearing their clothes, you being the only one naked, that you knew of, since you couldn\u2019t see Wanda.</p><p>\tYou could feel the, now warm, metal of the collar still around your neck.</p><p>\tBiting back a groan as you realized one of your ankles was possibly twisted or broken, you asked the boys, \u201cWhere\u2019s Wanda?\u201d</p><p>\tSam\u2019s eyes flickered beside you for a moment. But it was enough for you.</p><p>\tLeaning against the cold concrete wall, you spoke softly to the cell next to you, \u201cWands? How are you doing?\u201d<br/>\tYou heard a snort, before her soft Slovakian Accent floated towards you, \u201cShouldn\u2019t I be asking you that? Geez, Stark. They did a number on you and I only heard it, while the boys had to watch.\u201d</p><p>\tWincing, you couldn\u2019t stop the moan of pain as something tugged at your cheeks and liquid fell to the floor from your waist.</p><p>\t\u201cKid. Are you\u2026.Were you&hellip;aware?\u201d Scott\u2019s voice was not the bubbly, hyper, positive voice you remembered. </p><p>\tDimly, you were reminded that he had a daughter. And what it was probably like for him to witness what you were almost a hundred percent sure had happened to you.</p><p>\tShaking your head at him, you cradled your arm against you. Sam shouted, \u201cFuck!\u201d Before punching one of the walls of his cell.</p><p>\tClint had tears falling from his eyes as he winced from the sound.</p><p>\t\u201cWanda?\u201d You questioned, your working eye roaming around, looking for any signs of guards of the black ops, \u201cCan you pass a piece of cloth, from your uniform, to me? I need something to wrap around this wound.\u201d</p><p>\tAn intake of breath. And then you could see a strip of red dangling near one of your bars.</p><p>\tStretching out your arm, you grabbed it and felt Wanda let go.</p><p>\tUsing your teeth, you wrapped your arm so that the muscles weren\u2019t exposed anymore, tying off a tight knot despite the shot of pain that was sent through you.</p><p>\t\u201cHow long have I been out?\u201d Your voice still held authority as you fell to the ground to sit with your back against the wall that was connected to Wanda\u2019s cell. </p><p>Your eyes floating up the bright white fluorescent lights as you wondered if your brother was aware of what the government had done, was doing, to you and the team.</p><p>Scott was the one to answer you as Clint\u2019s breathing shuddered under the weight of his tears and Sam paced angrily in his tiny cell space. \u201cRoughly three hours. They\u2026.left you alone about an hour ago.\u201d</p><p>Nodding numbly, you shivered as the cold air of the Raft finally reached your desensitized state.</p><p>\u201c[Y/n]&hellip;.\u201d</p><p>You held up a hand, stopping whoever spoke from continuing. You were lost in your thoughts. </p><p>Remembering warm summer nights with Tony. Laughing as Dum-E sprayed him before an explosion went off. Rubbing Tony\u2019s back as you worked with him through a panic attack. Playing cards with the team in the common room of the tower. Blushing when Steve walked in on you working out. Giggling with Wanda and Natasha about the boys. Meeting Scott and cooing over his pictures of his daughter. </p><p>Then arguing with Tony. Throwing a vase as he left your room. Punching a security guard as he tried to stop you from going on a mission. Screaming during a mission briefing as Tony said you were the only one not allowed to go. Listening around a corner as a woman approached Tony about her son who was killed. Overhearing Ross thank the woman and pay her for the lie. Trying to talk to Tony only for him to discard you at every turn. Steve approaching you about Bucky. Hearing about Tony locking Wanda up in the tower. Agreeing to side with Steve after one last attempt to get Tony to listen to you that ended in tears and screams as he blamed you for your parents deaths.</p><p>\u201cLooks like our little plaything is finally awake.\u201d</p><p>You shot the person who spoke a withering look.</p><p>Dressed like a normal prison guard, the scruffy, greasy looking man simply laughed at you, \u201cAw does the kitten have her claws out? What? You seemed to enjoy it when you were unconscious. Body squeezing me just right\u2026\u201d Leering down at you, the man eyed your naked form with a feverous glint in his eyes.</p><p>Your vision went red with hate. When he leaned closer, you took the chance and hocked a huge glob of spit at him, smirking when it hit his cheek.</p><p>\u201cNo\u2026[Y/n].\u201d Clint whispered. Sagging down to his knees as he watched.</p><p>The man leaned over and clicked on his walkie talkie that was clipped onto his shoulder, \u201cPrisoner 5569 seems to be up for more fun. Anyone want to join?\u201d </p><p>And with a sinister smile, the man opened up your cell as feet pounded into the room.</p><p>Screaming, your fists and feet flew from your vulnerable position on the floor against the wall.</p><p>Rough hands gripped your wrists, hands a blur as more joined in, smiling twisted faces of greasy men hovering over you.</p><p>An agonized scream ripped through you at the audible snap of your wrist. The pain rocketing down your arm at the broken bone.</p><p>You were dragged up to your feet and taken out of your cell towards the center of the Raft.</p><p>As your team watched, they dragged your arms up, tying them together with leather and hooking it to a metal hook that was hanging from the roof.</p><p>Your feet swung wildly as your toes barely touched the ground, all your weight now resting on your arms.</p><p>Fresh blood rushed from the giant wound on your arm, soaking through the makeshift bandage from Wanda\u2019s cloth.</p><p>Unbidden, and unwanted tears fell from your face to mark the cement floor as your broken wrist screamed and your hand twisted in an unnatural angle. You could no longer feel your fingers and you knew that was a bad sign.</p><p>Head hanging low, you tried to focus on your team\u2019s voices.</p><p>Scott\u2019s ragged breathing, Sam\u2019s angry yells, Clint\u2019s whispered pleas, and Wanda\u2019s silent strength.</p><p>Your head flew up as a metal pipe slammed into your back.</p><p>A hand to your face.</p><p>A boot to your leg.</p><p>A face between your chest.</p><p>A hand between your legs.</p><p>A gunshot to your hand.</p><p>A whip across your stomach.</p><p>Fingers digging inside your arm, twisting the visible muscle.</p><p>A knife dragged down your spine.</p><p>Laughter. Jeers. Groans. Moans. Screams. Pleas. </p><p>Blood, spit, snot, tears, and various liquids on your face, stomach, dripping down your legs, pooling on the cement.</p><p>As you drew in a breath, about an hour into the torture, now ignoring your team, hating that they were able to see what was happening to you, a static sound pierced the room.</p><p>The men stopped, except the one currently using you.</p><p>\u201cA Tony Stark has landed and has been granted access.\u201d A Monotone AI voiced to the men.</p><p>You didn\u2019t show sign that you heard. You just didn\u2019t care. Your brother had thrown you into this hell. He was responsible. </p><p>As the men frantically tried to clean up. Tony stepped into the doorway. Everyone froze.</p><p>You kept your eyes closed.</p><p>\u201cGet away from my sister.\u201d A cold voice. Tangible anger and terror hovered in the stale air of the Raft.</p><p>Slow, methodical footsteps echoed as more frantic ones ran away from where you were still strung up.</p><p>The sound of a fist meeting flesh and the last man stopped and fled. Leaving you alone in the center of the Jail. </p><p>\u201cOh\u2026.[Y/n]&hellip;what did they do to you?\u201d You didn\u2019t bother looking at him. The tears in his voice not doing anything to you. You didn\u2019t have the capacity to care anymore.</p><p>Hands grabbed your wrists, causing an indrawn hiss of pain as the broken one was touched, before you were lowered to the ground.</p><p>Tony stared in horror at his, now blood covered hands.</p><p>\u201cYou caused this. You did this to your own family. Your own sister! Look at what you did Stark!\u201d Sam\u2019s voice was loud, watery, and filled with disgust.</p><p>Your breathing was wet as fluid filled your lungs. </p><p>Hands ghosted over your face, \u201c[Y/n]. Baby. Please wake up.\u201d</p><p>A groan, \u201cI\u2019m awake. Get away from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>You forced your one good eye to crack open and glare at the man kneeling over you.</p><p>He quickly removed his suit jacket when he saw your eye open and pulled it around your limp form, covering most of you.</p><p>\u201c[Y/n]&hellip;if I had known. If I knew that-\u201d</p><p>You harsh, barking laughter, accompanied by blood flowing down your chin, cut him off.</p><p>He stared in horror at you as you fixed him with an empty look, still lying prone on the \u00a0cement ground. You couldn\u2019t feel the cold.</p><p>\u201cWhat would you have done, Mr. Stark.\u201d He flinched Backwards when you called him that instead of Tony, \u201cYou would have requested I be put in a different cell? You would have left everyone to rot here while I got five star prison treatment? Should I kiss your shoes? Cry thanks for your concern? News flash&hellip;it\u2019s a few hours too late.\u201d</p><p>A coughing fit overcame you. Tony\u2019s hands helping you sit up. Immediately letting go when you snapped your teeth at him.</p><p>\u201c[Y/n]&hellip;he\u2019s still your brother. Let him help you.\u201d Wanda finally spoke after hours of being silent.</p><p>Another caustic laugh from you, \u201cSure. A brother who fought with me. Who didn\u2019t believe in me. Who let me be raped. Beat. Cut up and tortured. Who let the government call me a terrorist and place me in here. Who was willing to let me rot in this place-\u201d</p><p>This time Tony cut you off, his hands gripping your shoulders as he yelled at you, eyes wild in confusion and fear, \u201cNo! I wouldn\u2019t! I&hellip;I was in talks with Ross about these drastic measures&hellip;trying to work it so that all of you would be allowed a lighter sentence in state prison instead. I&hellip;didn\u2019t know. I didn\u2019t know! [Y/n], you\u2019ve gotta believe me! I didn\u2019t know!\u201d</p><p>You simply stared, no emotion, as he began crying, as he drug you towards him and buried his face into your shoulder, his tears mixing with the blood on your skin.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He pulled back to look at you, head tilted in confusion. Tears still running down his face.</p><p>You looked right at him. Right through him.</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I will not be the element for your tragic redemption or your backstory. I want no part of you. Of this family. I am no longer a Stark. I want you to leave me.\u201d</p><p>Tony jolted. Your voice was so monotonous. No emotion reflected through it. Not an ounce like he remembered you.</p><p>Not the sister he once had.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201c[Y/n] don\u2019t..\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe left her, I say good for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201c[Y/n]&hellip;I\u2019m not leaving you. I\u2019m not going to leave you again. I promise.\u201d</p><p>As Tony went to hug you. You swung your arm with the broken wrist at his face, hitting his cheek, not feeling the pain.</p><p>\u201cI said\u2026\u201d You drew in a breath and then screamed, \u201cLeave me! I am not a Stark! I am not your sister! I am a broken plaything and you are the one who made me this way!\u201d</p><p>Tony scurried backwards on his hands and knees as you began kicking at him. His eyes wide in terror and pain and sadness.</p><p>Your words morphed into an endless scream. Blood dripping from your throat as you tore your vocal chords.</p><p> Only stopping when Tony finally shook himself back to his senses, and with tears on his cheeks and an apology on his tongue, knocked you unconscious with a single hit to your head.</p><p>You had truly become broken. In just the few hours you had spent on the Raft. You were no longer [Y/n] Stark.</p><p>In truth&hellip;no one knew who&hellip;or what&hellip;you were anymore. Your family was gone. Broken. Just like your body. Just like your spirit. Just like your mind. Gone.</p><p><br/></p><p><b></b></p><p><b>FOREVER Taglist:</b></p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mueqGDjNU-px9eazPTAiIaw\">@sxph-t</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m6JrH0mInv0_jJIQb7ThoRQ\">@mialeelavellan</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mezyjFsJ8KB5sI8HvSbv3Pg\">@rainydaysrnevergrey</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mR_UCwARCul9gSnnNyDqpOQ\">@platonic-plots</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/maKNWOBDx1gFx-pwWIPIqLA\">@sociallyawkwardcircus-freak-hi</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mXMa1-Lg1MwHvfZ4eHrQ8Pg\">@ayyidkeither</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYmLRg0re4tEdiXOVlxPUfA\">@queenbbarnes</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mMa22YNJDzooYAhgSdAUaHA\">@mythixmagic</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mCCNAjP9ndzMFGDkgSK-_sw\">@chas-z</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mbgCK4NETm23uYtIEABN6-A\">@thefridgeismybestie</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mkPOqWgH7GCQm2YsvdXy7OQ\">@strangersstranger</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mPJVwxDeaQzxOgOZH4jTZ3w\">@princess-evans-addict</a>\u00a0</p><p><b></b></p><p><b>Avengers Taglist:</b></p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mSr3kQd1at8n76VB0yKCV3A\">@jadepc</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mLIpjwC1nGFEZTXugUExGSg\">@marvel-is-a-mood</a></p>",

A distant father who never wanted anything to do with you, a mother who tried her hardest that you barely remembered, because they had been killed during a car accident when you were still a child.</p>[[MORE]]<p>\tTony had raised you single handedly, and you helped build Stark Enterprise from the ground up after your brother inherited it. You had cried and screamed when the video surfaced of your brother being tortured and held captive in Afghanistan. You had been beside him when Fury approached him about the Avengers initiative. You had teased him for years about his crush on Pepper.</p><p>\tHe had held your hand when you walked to school the week after your parents deaths. He had taught you how to build your own Iron Suit. He had helped you hone your mutation. He had let your cry on his shoulder when your date stood you up and later, he took you out for ice cream after scaring the boy into apologizing. He called you as soon as he escaped and Rhodey found him in the desert. He let you handle the inner details regarding the Avengers Initiative and he was the one who talked to Fury about letting you join. He had teased you about your crush on Steve.</p><p>\t\u201cWhatever. Underoos!\u201d</p><p>\tAnd a small red bundle flew by and ripped Steve\u2019s shield out of his hands and weird white fluid stuck his hands together. </p><p>\tAnd the next thing you knew, you were running alongside Clint towards your former teammates and family member.</p><p>\tUsing your mutation, you kept Rhodey from hitting Scott as he flew through the air on one of Clint\u2019s arrows.</p><p>\tKeeping an eye on your brother and Bucky, you kept Wanda safe as she let Bucky and Steve run into the hangar where the Jet was. </p><p>\tRunning, you tried to stop the weird guy in the fursona of a cat, but a swift kick to your head knocked you to the ground.</p><p>\tGroaning, you looked up and a blurry image of a red android floated before you.</p><p>\t\u201cStay down Ms. Stark. For your own safety, please don\u2019t resist.\u201d</p><p>\tThe calm, cool, and confident voice of the previous Jarvis turned Vision, made its way into your foggy head.</p><p>\tFlopping back down, you heard the rumble of a jet and watched with a satisfied smirk as the jet flew overhead.</p><p>\tVision didn\u2019t leave your side, tilting his head at your prone self, he noticed the smirk, \u201cYou are glad that Rhodey seems to be paralyzed?\u201d</p><p>\tYou froze. Your smirk sliding off your face. You squinted at the android. The kick he had delivered to your head still messing with your eyes.</p><p>\t\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\tVision nodded slowly, no emotion on his face, \u201cIt seems Rhodey fell at a high velocity and crashed.\u201d</p><p>\tYour heart broke for your brother\u2019s best friend. The man who was a sort of Uncle to you. </p><p>\t\u201cHands in the air! Raise them up! Stay still!\u201d </p><p>\tOrders screamed through the dust settling across the airport. Men in black ops and holding rifles stormed the area.</p><p>\tAs one roughly dragged you up to your feet, you dimly registered that Scott, Clint, Sam, and Wanda were getting similar harsh treatment.</p><p>\tBut Steve and Bucky were gone. You were glad. The mission at least was somewhat a success.</p><p>\t\u201cCan I have a word with my sister?\u201d</p><p>\tVision somewhat stable now, you turned your head to see your brother, still in his Iron Man suit, his mask receded so that you could see his bruised face.</p><p>\tWincing, you steadied your feet. Staring at your brother, you saw the tired, dead look in his eyes as he looked at you.</p><p>\tThe man holding your arm leaned over and whispered so softly that Tony couldn\u2019t hear, \u201cGive me a reason to shoot your brains out you freak.\u201d Before he let go, only took a few steps back, his rifle still trained on your head.</p><p>\t\u201c[Y/n]..\u201d Tony groaned, running a hand down his face. Smearing dirt and blood.</p><p>\tYou kept your calm, your voice steady, \u201cI know what you\u2019re going to say. But I don\u2019t regret my decision. You were going to far Tony. The Accords? Really? It would be prison for people like me. We would become weapons sold out to the highest bidder. And You let that man,\u201d You spat, remembering how Ross twisted words and lied to your brother, \u201clie to you and you\u2026the so called genius of this family, didn\u2019t look up the validity of his words!\u201d</p><p>\tTony flinched as if you had hit him. </p><p>\tHis eyes hardened and he gestured to the man standing behind you. Your arms were twisted behind your back again, the rifle pressed against your skull.</p><p>\t\u201cIt hurts me to turn you over to the government\u2026you\u2019re still my sister\u2026I still Love you. I hope you can come to your senses soon.\u201d </p><p>\tYour brother\u2019s words were soft. But you growled at him, your mutation flaring up before dying away as you remembered the gun at your head.</p><p>\t\u201cShut the fuck up, Tony!\u201d</p><p>\tTony stumbled. Vision catching him before he could fall.</p><p>\tYou continued, words falling like acid from your lips, all the rage and betrayal you felt coming into your tone \u201cYou don\u2019t care about me! You never cared about me! You never listened to me or my opinions! You always treated me like glass, like I would break if I so much as tripped! News flash, Tony! I\u2019m stronger than you will ever be and I\u2019m glad that Steve got Bucky out of here because you have become the Villain in this scenario!\u201d</p><p>\tYour wretched scream, that tore at your throat, was accompanied by bitter tears, both fading as you were drug aboard a plane and the gangway slowly closed, encasing you in darkness.</p><p>\tOnce away from the prying eyes of Team Tony, the black ops military men wasted no time in clipping on handcuffs to your team members.</p><p>\tBut, then they pulled you and Wanda to the other side of the plane.</p><p>\tScott pulled at his handcuffs, his eyes wide with worry, \u201cWhat are you doing to them?\u201d</p><p>\tThe men didn\u2019t respond. And then there was a click and the cold feeling of metal encasing your neck.</p><p>\tLooking over at Wanda, you saw her watching you with horror mirrored in her eyes. She had a collar on her neck, which you figured was what was around yours as well. It was blinking red.</p><p>\tWith a growl, you reached for your mutation, intending to get away from these men and escape with your team.</p><p>\tBut the minute you tried to focus your mutation, your entire body jerked as electricity was shot through you.</p><p>\tA strangled gasp left you as you fell to the floor of the plane, your elbows hitting metal, sending pain through your arms as you tried to protect your head.</p><p>\t\u201c[Y/n]!? What did you do to her!?\u201d Sam screamed, fighting against the hold of two men while another was removing his wings.</p><p>\tThe leader looked over at him with disinterested eyes, \u201cIt\u2019s a prototype. A suppressant collar that prevents them from using their mutations.\u201d He turned to look over you and Wanda, a sinister glint entering his eyes, \u201cIf I were you, I would not attempt to escape. The shocks will grow in intensity the more you try to use your freak powers.\u201d</p><p>\tPanting, you rolled over to your knees, your hands cuffed in front of you, pushing yourself to your feet, muscles straining against the tightness that the electricity had caused. </p><p>\tWanda\u2019s own handcuffed hands fluttered over you as you let your head loll onto her shoulder. Pain still jolting through your body. If that was the first shock, and if what the man said was true, you didn\u2019t want to know what the next shock would feel like. </p><p>\tThe next few hours passed in relative silence.</p><p>\tScott, Sam and Clint spoke to each other in whispers on their side of the plane, shooting you and Wanda the occasional comforting looks.</p><p>\tYou and Wanda stayed next to each other, holding onto each other\u2019s hands, grip so tight, you thought you both would lose blood circulation.</p><p>\tThe destination was kept away from you no matter how many times you asked. And each ask got you the same answer\u2026a fist to the cheek.</p><p>\tBlood dripped from a split lip and your left eye was swollen shut by the time the drone of the engines was cut.</p><p>\t\u201cWe\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>\tMen grabbed your arms, ripping your hands away from Wanda. She whimpered, but kept quiet when you shot her a look of warning.</p><p>\tThe men stood behind her as you stood next to the man in charge, waiting for the gangway to lower. </p><p>\tAnd how you wished you weren\u2019t in the front when it did. </p><p>\tA loud roar of crashing waves reached you first before your vision computed what you were seeing.</p><p>\tA floating building. In the middle of the ocean. Rocking violently as the huge swells of sea water crashed against it.</p><p>\t\u201cNo no no nonononononono!\u201d Your words reached a fever scream as you pulled against the arms dragging you forward.</p><p>\tThe words your teammates said faded into white noise as your vision went white in terror. </p><p>\tThe ground that you were now standing on, rocking back and forth, your legs gave out on you.</p><p>\tYou didn\u2019t drop though, as the hands tightened on your arms, leaving bruises as they simply continued walking, dragging you now into the building.</p><p>\t\u201cHey! Where are we!?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cWhat is this place!?\u201d<br>\t\u201cWe have rights!\u201d</p><p>\tThe men laughed at that. Clint scowled. </p><p>\tYou were brought back to the present as you began being dragged down stairs.</p><p>\tYour knees hitting the metal grates, new cuts and gashes and bruises appearing on your skin.</p><p>\t\u201cYou are traitors to the US Government. Prisoners of the state, and you have no rights. This is the Raft, and it will be your home until the day you die.\u201d</p><p>\tStumbling to your feet, you looked around. The floor wasn\u2019t moving as bad, but your terror was barely held back due to the knowledge that it wasn\u2019t moving as bad because you were under water.</p><p>\tRight now, you were standing before a gate, that almost looked like an airport security scanner. Beyond that, you saw a circular room, with various cells in the walls.</p><p>\tYou were dragged into the airport looking security scanner.</p><p>\tA bored looking guy stood behind a glass window, looking at a computer screen. His voice came through an intercom, \u201cStrip.\u201d</p><p>\tBaring your teeth, you lunged towards the window.</p><p>\tIgnoring the yells of Clint to stop.</p><p>\tThat was the last thing you heard as you felt a blinding pain to the back of your skull before you vision went dark as unconsciousness took over.</p><p>\t\u201c[Y/n]!\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cStop!\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cGet your hands off her!\u201d</p><p>\t\u201c[Y/n]!\u201d<br>\t\u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cStop!\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cPlease!\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cLet her go!\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cStop!\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cWhat are you doing!?\u201d<br>\t\u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cStop!\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cPlease!\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cPlease!\u201d<br>\t\u201cDon\u2019t!\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cShe\u2019s unconscious!\u201d<br>\t\u201cYou can\u2019t!\u201d<br>\t\u201c[Y/n]\u2026.We\u2019re sorry\u2026\u201d</p><p>\tWhen consciousness finally returned to you. The first thing you noticed was the soreness between your legs.</p><p>\tThe second was the fact that you were naked.\t</p><p>\tAnd the final thing was the amount of blood that was pooled around your sprawled body.</p><p>\t\u201cWanda?\u201d Your voice was hoarse, and you had to cough several times to clear it. \u201cWanda? Clint? Sam? Scott?\u201d</p><p>\tYou called out for your team. Looking around as you recognized a cell.</p><p>\tA single toilet and a metal bed frame decorated it. Standing up, wincing at the pain you were in, you took stock of yourself.</p><p>\tCuts littered your body. A large gash on your arm had you hissing as you saw the white muscles open to the air.</p><p>\tYour legs were shaky as you realized what had happened while you were unconscious. Bile drew up to your throat. Choking it down, you fought the urge to cry as well.</p><p>\tLimping on bare feet to the metal cell doors, you peered out. Your eye still swollen shut, your face stinging with new wounds that you couldn\u2019t see. </p><p>\t\u201cGuys?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cShe\u2019s awake!\u201d</p><p>\t\u201c[Y/n]\u2026god. I am so sorry! I tried to get them to stop!\u201d Sam reached his hands out through his cell bars. He was directly across from you. Clint and Scott on either side, you could barely make out their faces as the cells curved. You noticed that they were still wearing their clothes, you being the only one naked, that you knew of, since you couldn\u2019t see Wanda.</p><p>\tYou could feel the, now warm, metal of the collar still around your neck.</p><p>\tBiting back a groan as you realized one of your ankles was possibly twisted or broken, you asked the boys, \u201cWhere\u2019s Wanda?\u201d</p><p>\tSam\u2019s eyes flickered beside you for a moment. But it was enough for you.</p><p>\tLeaning against the cold concrete wall, you spoke softly to the cell next to you, \u201cWands? How are you doing?\u201d<br>\tYou heard a snort, before her soft Slovakian Accent floated towards you, \u201cShouldn\u2019t I be asking you that? Geez, Stark. They did a number on you and I only heard it, while the boys had to watch.\u201d</p><p>\tWincing, you couldn\u2019t stop the moan of pain as something tugged at your cheeks and liquid fell to the floor from your waist.</p><p>\t\u201cKid. Are you\u2026.Were you\u2026aware?\u201d Scott\u2019s voice was not the bubbly, hyper, positive voice you remembered. </p><p>\tDimly, you were reminded that he had a daughter. And what it was probably like for him to witness what you were almost a hundred percent sure had happened to you.</p><p>\tShaking your head at him, you cradled your arm against you. Sam shouted, \u201cFuck!\u201d Before punching one of the walls of his cell.</p><p>\tClint had tears falling from his eyes as he winced from the sound.</p><p>\t\u201cWanda?\u201d You questioned, your working eye roaming around, looking for any signs of guards of the black ops, \u201cCan you pass a piece of cloth, from your uniform, to me? I need something to wrap around this wound.\u201d</p><p>\tAn intake of breath. And then you could see a strip of red dangling near one of your bars.</p><p>\tStretching out your arm, you grabbed it and felt Wanda let go.</p><p>\tUsing your teeth, you wrapped your arm so that the muscles weren\u2019t exposed anymore, tying off a tight knot despite the shot of pain that was sent through you.</p><p>\t\u201cHow long have I been out?\u201d Your voice still held authority as you fell to the ground to sit with your back against the wall that was connected to Wanda\u2019s cell. </p><p>Your eyes floating up the bright white fluorescent lights as you wondered if your brother was aware of what the government had done, was doing, to you and the team.</p><p>Scott was the one to answer you as Clint\u2019s breathing shuddered under the weight of his tears and Sam paced angrily in his tiny cell space. \u201cRoughly three hours. They\u2026.left you alone about an hour ago.\u201d</p><p>Nodding numbly, you shivered as the cold air of the Raft finally reached your desensitized state.</p><p>\u201c[Y/n]\u2026.\u201d</p><p>You held up a hand, stopping whoever spoke from continuing. You were lost in your thoughts. </p><p>Remembering warm summer nights with Tony. Laughing as Dum-E sprayed him before an explosion went off. Rubbing Tony\u2019s back as you worked with him through a panic attack. Playing cards with the team in the common room of the tower. Blushing when Steve walked in on you working out. Giggling with Wanda and Natasha about the boys. Meeting Scott and cooing over his pictures of his daughter. </p><p>Then arguing with Tony. Throwing a vase as he left your room. Punching a security guard as he tried to stop you from going on a mission. Screaming during a mission briefing as Tony said you were the only one not allowed to go. Listening around a corner as a woman approached Tony about her son who was killed. Overhearing Ross thank the woman and pay her for the lie. Trying to talk to Tony only for him to discard you at every turn. Steve approaching you about Bucky. Hearing about Tony locking Wanda up in the tower. Agreeing to side with Steve after one last attempt to get Tony to listen to you that ended in tears and screams as he blamed you for your parents deaths.</p><p>\u201cLooks like our little plaything is finally awake.\u201d</p><p>You shot the person who spoke a withering look.</p><p>Dressed like a normal prison guard, the scruffy, greasy looking man simply laughed at you, \u201cAw does the kitten have her claws out? What? You seemed to enjoy it when you were unconscious. Body squeezing me just right\u2026\u201d Leering down at you, the man eyed your naked form with a feverous glint in his eyes.</p><p>Your vision went red with hate. When he leaned closer, you took the chance and hocked a huge glob of spit at him, smirking when it hit his cheek.</p><p>\u201cNo\u2026[Y/n].\u201d Clint whispered. Sagging down to his knees as he watched.</p><p>The man leaned over and clicked on his walkie talkie that was clipped onto his shoulder, \u201cPrisoner 5569 seems to be up for more fun. Anyone want to join?\u201d </p><p>And with a sinister smile, the man opened up your cell as feet pounded into the room.</p><p>Screaming, your fists and feet flew from your vulnerable position on the floor against the wall.</p><p>Rough hands gripped your wrists, hands a blur as more joined in, smiling twisted faces of greasy men hovering over you.</p><p>An agonized scream ripped through you at the audible snap of your wrist. The pain rocketing down your arm at the broken bone.</p><p>You were dragged up to your feet and taken out of your cell towards the center of the Raft.</p><p>As your team watched, they dragged your arms up, tying them together with leather and hooking it to a metal hook that was hanging from the roof.</p><p>Your feet swung wildly as your toes barely touched the ground, all your weight now resting on your arms.</p><p>Fresh blood rushed from the giant wound on your arm, soaking through the makeshift bandage from Wanda\u2019s cloth.</p><p>Unbidden, and unwanted tears fell from your face to mark the cement floor as your broken wrist screamed and your hand twisted in an unnatural angle. You could no longer feel your fingers and you knew that was a bad sign.</p><p>Head hanging low, you tried to focus on your team\u2019s voices.</p><p>Scott\u2019s ragged breathing, Sam\u2019s angry yells, Clint\u2019s whispered pleas, and Wanda\u2019s silent strength.</p><p>Your head flew up as a metal pipe slammed into your back.</p><p>A hand to your face.</p><p>A boot to your leg.</p><p>A face between your chest.</p><p>A hand between your legs.</p><p>A gunshot to your hand.</p><p>A whip across your stomach.</p><p>Fingers digging inside your arm, twisting the visible muscle.</p><p>A knife dragged down your spine.</p><p>Laughter. Jeers. Groans. Moans. Screams. Pleas. </p><p>Blood, spit, snot, tears, and various liquids on your face, stomach, dripping down your legs, pooling on the cement.</p><p>As you drew in a breath, about an hour into the torture, now ignoring your team, hating that they were able to see what was happening to you, a static sound pierced the room.</p><p>The men stopped, except the one currently using you.</p><p>\u201cA Tony Stark has landed and has been granted access.\u201d A Monotone AI voiced to the men.</p><p>You didn\u2019t show sign that you heard. You just didn\u2019t care. Your brother had thrown you into this hell. He was responsible. </p><p>As the men frantically tried to clean up. Tony stepped into the doorway. Everyone froze.</p><p>You kept your eyes closed.</p><p>\u201cGet away from my sister.\u201d A cold voice. Tangible anger and terror hovered in the stale air of the Raft.</p><p>Slow, methodical footsteps echoed as more frantic ones ran away from where you were still strung up.</p><p>The sound of a fist meeting flesh and the last man stopped and fled. Leaving you alone in the center of the Jail. </p><p>\u201cOh\u2026.[Y/n]\u2026what did they do to you?\u201d You didn\u2019t bother looking at him. The tears in his voice not doing anything to you. You didn\u2019t have the capacity to care anymore.</p><p>Hands grabbed your wrists, causing an indrawn hiss of pain as the broken one was touched, before you were lowered to the ground.</p><p>Tony stared in horror at his, now blood covered hands.</p><p>\u201cYou caused this. You did this to your own family. Your own sister! Look at what you did Stark!\u201d Sam\u2019s voice was loud, watery, and filled with disgust.</p><p>Your breathing was wet as fluid filled your lungs. </p><p>Hands ghosted over your face, \u201c[Y/n]. Baby. Please wake up.\u201d</p><p>A groan, \u201cI\u2019m awake. Get away from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>You forced your one good eye to crack open and glare at the man kneeling over you.</p><p>He quickly removed his suit jacket when he saw your eye open and pulled it around your limp form, covering most of you.</p><p>\u201c[Y/n]\u2026if I had known. If I knew that-\u201d</p><p>You harsh, barking laughter, accompanied by blood flowing down your chin, cut him off.</p><p>He stared in horror at you as you fixed him with an empty look, still lying prone on the \u00a0cement ground. You couldn\u2019t feel the cold.</p><p>\u201cWhat would you have done, Mr. Stark.\u201d He flinched Backwards when you called him that instead of Tony, \u201cYou would have requested I be put in a different cell? You would have left everyone to rot here while I got five star prison treatment? Should I kiss your shoes? Cry thanks for your concern? News flash\u2026it\u2019s a few hours too late.\u201d</p><p>A coughing fit overcame you. Tony\u2019s hands helping you sit up. Immediately letting go when you snapped your teeth at him.</p><p>\u201c[Y/n]\u2026he\u2019s still your brother. Let him help you.\u201d Wanda finally spoke after hours of being silent.</p><p>Another caustic laugh from you, \u201cSure. A brother who fought with me. Who didn\u2019t believe in me. Who let me be raped. Beat. Cut up and tortured. Who let the government call me a terrorist and place me in here. Who was willing to let me rot in this place-\u201d</p><p>This time Tony cut you off, his hands gripping your shoulders as he yelled at you, eyes wild in confusion and fear, \u201cNo! I wouldn\u2019t! I\u2026I was in talks with Ross about these drastic measures\u2026trying to work it so that all of you would be allowed a lighter sentence in state prison instead. I\u2026didn\u2019t know. I didn\u2019t know! [Y/n], you\u2019ve gotta believe me! I didn\u2019t know!\u201d</p><p>You simply stared, no emotion, as he began crying, as he drug you towards him and buried his face into your shoulder, his tears mixing with the blood on your skin.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He pulled back to look at you, head tilted in confusion. Tears still running down his face.</p><p>You looked right at him. Right through him.</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I will not be the element for your tragic redemption or your backstory. I want no part of you. Of this family. I am no longer a Stark. I want you to leave me.\u201d</p><p>Tony jolted. Your voice was so monotonous. No emotion reflected through it. Not an ounce like he remembered you.</p><p>Not the sister he once had.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201c[Y/n] don\u2019t..\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe left her, I say good for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201c[Y/n]\u2026I\u2019m not leaving you. I\u2019m not going to leave you again. I promise.\u201d</p><p>As Tony went to hug you. You swung your arm with the broken wrist at his face, hitting his cheek, not feeling the pain.</p><p>\u201cI said\u2026\u201d You drew in a breath and then screamed, \u201cLeave me! I am not a Stark! I am not your sister! I am a broken plaything and you are the one who made me this way!\u201d</p><p>Tony scurried backwards on his hands and knees as you began kicking at him. His eyes wide in terror and pain and sadness.</p><p>Your words morphed into an endless scream. Blood dripping from your throat as you tore your vocal chords.</p><p> Only stopping when Tony finally shook himself back to his senses, and with tears on his cheeks and an apology on his tongue, knocked you unconscious with a single hit to your head.</p><p>You had truly become broken. In just the few hours you had spent on the Raft. You were no longer [Y/n] Stark.</p><p>In truth\u2026no one knew who\u2026or what\u2026you were anymore. Your family was gone. Broken. Just like your body. Just like your spirit. Just like your mind. Gone.</p><p><br></p><p><b></b></p><p><b>FOREVER Taglist:</b></p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mueqGDjNU-px9eazPTAiIaw\">@sxph-t</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m6JrH0mInv0_jJIQb7ThoRQ\">@mialeelavellan</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mezyjFsJ8KB5sI8HvSbv3Pg\">@rainydaysrnevergrey</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mR_UCwARCul9gSnnNyDqpOQ\">@platonic-plots</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/maKNWOBDx1gFx-pwWIPIqLA\">@sociallyawkwardcircus-freak-hi</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mXMa1-Lg1MwHvfZ4eHrQ8Pg\">@ayyidkeither</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYmLRg0re4tEdiXOVlxPUfA\">@queenbbarnes</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mMa22YNJDzooYAhgSdAUaHA\">@mythixmagic</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mCCNAjP9ndzMFGDkgSK-_sw\">@chas-z</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mbgCK4NETm23uYtIEABN6-A\">@thefridgeismybestie</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mkPOqWgH7GCQm2YsvdXy7OQ\">@strangersstranger</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mPJVwxDeaQzxOgOZH4jTZ3w\">@princess-evans-addict</a>\u00a0</p><p><b></b></p><p><b>Avengers Taglist:</b></p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mSr3kQd1at8n76VB0yKCV3A\">@jadepc</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mLIpjwC1nGFEZTXugUExGSg\">@marvel-is-a-mood</a></p></p>",

Also, I made Tony sorta an asshole. Sorry not sorry</b></p><p>\t\u201c[Y/n]?\u201d</p><p>\tThe soft, agonized sound of your name coming from the Iron Man suit floating across the airport from you tore at your heart.</p><p>\tBut you didn\u2019t let your face betray your churning emotions. </p><p>\t\u201cTony\u2026They chose their side.\u201d Steve\u2019s voice carried across the distance without a need for shouting. The strength in him bolstering your own. </p><p>\tEven though you were Tony\u2019s little sister, you did not agree with his way of handling the current issues happening within the Avengers, especially when he locked up Wanda without talking to anyone.</p><p>\tBlood may be thicker than water, and all that jazz, but you needed to stand by your beliefs. Which led to you being on the opposite side of your brother, ready to fight him.</p><p>\t\u201c[Y/n]\u2026\u201d You felt, more than heard, the sigh your brother gave. </p><p>\tOnce more your heart pulled at you to comfort him.</p><p>\tFor so long, it had been you two against the world. A distant father who never wanted anything to do with you, a mother who tried her hardest that you barely remembered, because they had been killed during a car accident when you were still a child.</p>[[MORE]]<p>\tTony had raised you single handedly, and you helped build Stark Enterprise from the ground up after your brother inherited it. You had cried and screamed when the video surfaced of your brother being tortured and held captive in Afghanistan. You had been beside him when Fury approached him about the Avengers initiative. You had teased him for years about his crush on Pepper.</p><p>\tHe had held your hand when you walked to school the week after your parents deaths. He had taught you how to build your own Iron Suit. He had helped you hone your mutation. He had let your cry on his shoulder when your date stood you up and later, he took you out for ice cream after scaring the boy into apologizing. He called you as soon as he escaped and Rhodey found him in the desert. He let you handle the inner details regarding the Avengers Initiative and he was the one who talked to Fury about letting you join. He had teased you about your crush on Steve.</p><p>\t\u201cWhatever. Underoos!\u201d</p><p>\tAnd a small red bundle flew by and ripped Steve\u2019s shield out of his hands and weird white fluid stuck his hands together. </p><p>\tAnd the next thing you knew, you were running alongside Clint towards your former teammates and family member.</p><p>\tUsing your mutation, you kept Rhodey from hitting Scott as he flew through the air on one of Clint\u2019s arrows.</p><p>\tKeeping an eye on your brother and Bucky, you kept Wanda safe as she let Bucky and Steve run into the hangar where the Jet was. </p><p>\tRunning, you tried to stop the weird guy in the fursona of a cat, but a swift kick to your head knocked you to the ground.</p><p>\tGroaning, you looked up and a blurry image of a red android floated before you.</p><p>\t\u201cStay down Ms. Stark. For your own safety, please don\u2019t resist.\u201d</p><p>\tThe calm, cool, and confident voice of the previous Jarvis turned Vision, made its way into your foggy head.</p><p>\tFlopping back down, you heard the rumble of a jet and watched with a satisfied smirk as the jet flew overhead.</p><p>\tVision didn\u2019t leave your side, tilting his head at your prone self, he noticed the smirk, \u201cYou are glad that Rhodey seems to be paralyzed?\u201d</p><p>\tYou froze. Your smirk sliding off your face. You squinted at the android. The kick he had delivered to your head still messing with your eyes.</p><p>\t\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\tVision nodded slowly, no emotion on his face, \u201cIt seems Rhodey fell at a high velocity and crashed.\u201d</p><p>\tYour heart broke for your brother\u2019s best friend. The man who was a sort of Uncle to you. </p><p>\t\u201cHands in the air! Raise them up! Stay still!\u201d </p><p>\tOrders screamed through the dust settling across the airport. Men in black ops and holding rifles stormed the area.</p><p>\tAs one roughly dragged you up to your feet, you dimly registered that Scott, Clint, Sam, and Wanda were getting similar harsh treatment.</p><p>\tBut Steve and Bucky were gone. You were glad. The mission at least was somewhat a success.</p><p>\t\u201cCan I have a word with my sister?\u201d</p><p>\tVision somewhat stable now, you turned your head to see your brother, still in his Iron Man suit, his mask receded so that you could see his bruised face.</p><p>\tWincing, you steadied your feet. Staring at your brother, you saw the tired, dead look in his eyes as he looked at you.</p><p>\tThe man holding your arm leaned over and whispered so softly that Tony couldn\u2019t hear, \u201cGive me a reason to shoot your brains out you freak.\u201d Before he let go, only took a few steps back, his rifle still trained on your head.</p><p>\t\u201c[Y/n]..\u201d Tony groaned, running a hand down his face. Smearing dirt and blood.</p><p>\tYou kept your calm, your voice steady, \u201cI know what you\u2019re going to say. But I don\u2019t regret my decision. You were going to far Tony. The Accords? Really? It would be prison for people like me. We would become weapons sold out to the highest bidder. And You let that man,\u201d You spat, remembering how Ross twisted words and lied to your brother, \u201clie to you and you\u2026the so called genius of this family, didn\u2019t look up the validity of his words!\u201d</p><p>\tTony flinched as if you had hit him. </p><p>\tHis eyes hardened and he gestured to the man standing behind you. Your arms were twisted behind your back again, the rifle pressed against your skull.</p><p>\t\u201cIt hurts me to turn you over to the government\u2026you\u2019re still my sister\u2026I still Love you. I hope you can come to your senses soon.\u201d </p><p>\tYour brother\u2019s words were soft. But you growled at him, your mutation flaring up before dying away as you remembered the gun at your head.</p><p>\t\u201cShut the fuck up, Tony!\u201d</p><p>\tTony stumbled. Vision catching him before he could fall.</p><p>\tYou continued, words falling like acid from your lips, all the rage and betrayal you felt coming into your tone \u201cYou don\u2019t care about me! You never cared about me! You never listened to me or my opinions! You always treated me like glass, like I would break if I so much as tripped! News flash, Tony! I\u2019m stronger than you will ever be and I\u2019m glad that Steve got Bucky out of here because you have become the Villain in this scenario!\u201d</p><p>\tYour wretched scream, that tore at your throat, was accompanied by bitter tears, both fading as you were drug aboard a plane and the gangway slowly closed, encasing you in darkness.</p><p>\tOnce away from the prying eyes of Team Tony, the black ops military men wasted no time in clipping on handcuffs to your team members.</p><p>\tBut, then they pulled you and Wanda to the other side of the plane.</p><p>\tScott pulled at his handcuffs, his eyes wide with worry, \u201cWhat are you doing to them?\u201d</p><p>\tThe men didn\u2019t respond. And then there was a click and the cold feeling of metal encasing your neck.</p><p>\tLooking over at Wanda, you saw her watching you with horror mirrored in her eyes. She had a collar on her neck, which you figured was what was around yours as well. It was blinking red.</p><p>\tWith a growl, you reached for your mutation, intending to get away from these men and escape with your team.</p><p>\tBut the minute you tried to focus your mutation, your entire body jerked as electricity was shot through you.</p><p>\tA strangled gasp left you as you fell to the floor of the plane, your elbows hitting metal, sending pain through your arms as you tried to protect your head.</p><p>\t\u201c[Y/n]!? What did you do to her!?\u201d Sam screamed, fighting against the hold of two men while another was removing his wings.</p><p>\tThe leader looked over at him with disinterested eyes, \u201cIt\u2019s a prototype. A suppressant collar that prevents them from using their mutations.\u201d He turned to look over you and Wanda, a sinister glint entering his eyes, \u201cIf I were you, I would not attempt to escape. The shocks will grow in intensity the more you try to use your freak powers.\u201d</p><p>\tPanting, you rolled over to your knees, your hands cuffed in front of you, pushing yourself to your feet, muscles straining against the tightness that the electricity had caused. </p><p>\tWanda\u2019s own handcuffed hands fluttered over you as you let your head loll onto her shoulder. Pain still jolting through your body. If that was the first shock, and if what the man said was true, you didn\u2019t want to know what the next shock would feel like. </p><p>\tThe next few hours passed in relative silence.</p><p>\tScott, Sam and Clint spoke to each other in whispers on their side of the plane, shooting you and Wanda the occasional comforting looks.</p><p>\tYou and Wanda stayed next to each other, holding onto each other\u2019s hands, grip so tight, you thought you both would lose blood circulation.</p><p>\tThe destination was kept away from you no matter how many times you asked. And each ask got you the same answer\u2026a fist to the cheek.</p><p>\tBlood dripped from a split lip and your left eye was swollen shut by the time the drone of the engines was cut.</p><p>\t\u201cWe\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>\tMen grabbed your arms, ripping your hands away from Wanda. She whimpered, but kept quiet when you shot her a look of warning.</p><p>\tThe men stood behind her as you stood next to the man in charge, waiting for the gangway to lower. </p><p>\tAnd how you wished you weren\u2019t in the front when it did. </p><p>\tA loud roar of crashing waves reached you first before your vision computed what you were seeing.</p><p>\tA floating building. In the middle of the ocean. Rocking violently as the huge swells of sea water crashed against it.</p><p>\t\u201cNo no no nonononononono!\u201d Your words reached a fever scream as you pulled against the arms dragging you forward.</p><p>\tThe words your teammates said faded into white noise as your vision went white in terror. </p><p>\tThe ground that you were now standing on, rocking back and forth, your legs gave out on you.</p><p>\tYou didn\u2019t drop though, as the hands tightened on your arms, leaving bruises as they simply continued walking, dragging you now into the building.</p><p>\t\u201cHey! Where are we!?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cWhat is this place!?\u201d<br>\t\u201cWe have rights!\u201d</p><p>\tThe men laughed at that. Clint scowled. </p><p>\tYou were brought back to the present as you began being dragged down stairs.</p><p>\tYour knees hitting the metal grates, new cuts and gashes and bruises appearing on your skin.</p><p>\t\u201cYou are traitors to the US Government. Prisoners of the state, and you have no rights. This is the Raft, and it will be your home until the day you die.\u201d</p><p>\tStumbling to your feet, you looked around. The floor wasn\u2019t moving as bad, but your terror was barely held back due to the knowledge that it wasn\u2019t moving as bad because you were under water.</p><p>\tRight now, you were standing before a gate, that almost looked like an airport security scanner. Beyond that, you saw a circular room, with various cells in the walls.</p><p>\tYou were dragged into the airport looking security scanner.</p><p>\tA bored looking guy stood behind a glass window, looking at a computer screen. His voice came through an intercom, \u201cStrip.\u201d</p><p>\tBaring your teeth, you lunged towards the window.</p><p>\tIgnoring the yells of Clint to stop.</p><p>\tThat was the last thing you heard as you felt a blinding pain to the back of your skull before you vision went dark as unconsciousness took over.</p><p>\t\u201c[Y/n]!\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cStop!\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cGet your hands off her!\u201d</p><p>\t\u201c[Y/n]!\u201d<br>\t\u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cStop!\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cPlease!\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cLet her go!\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cStop!\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cWhat are you doing!?\u201d<br>\t\u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cStop!\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cPlease!\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cPlease!\u201d<br>\t\u201cDon\u2019t!\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cShe\u2019s unconscious!\u201d<br>\t\u201cYou can\u2019t!\u201d<br>\t\u201c[Y/n]\u2026.We\u2019re sorry\u2026\u201d</p><p>\tWhen consciousness finally returned to you. The first thing you noticed was the soreness between your legs.</p><p>\tThe second was the fact that you were naked.\t</p><p>\tAnd the final thing was the amount of blood that was pooled around your sprawled body.</p><p>\t\u201cWanda?\u201d Your voice was hoarse, and you had to cough several times to clear it. \u201cWanda? Clint? Sam? Scott?\u201d</p><p>\tYou called out for your team. Looking around as you recognized a cell.</p><p>\tA single toilet and a metal bed frame decorated it. Standing up, wincing at the pain you were in, you took stock of yourself.</p><p>\tCuts littered your body. A large gash on your arm had you hissing as you saw the white muscles open to the air.</p><p>\tYour legs were shaky as you realized what had happened while you were unconscious. Bile drew up to your throat. Choking it down, you fought the urge to cry as well.</p><p>\tLimping on bare feet to the metal cell doors, you peered out. Your eye still swollen shut, your face stinging with new wounds that you couldn\u2019t see. </p><p>\t\u201cGuys?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cShe\u2019s awake!\u201d</p><p>\t\u201c[Y/n]\u2026god. I am so sorry! I tried to get them to stop!\u201d Sam reached his hands out through his cell bars. He was directly across from you. Clint and Scott on either side, you could barely make out their faces as the cells curved. You noticed that they were still wearing their clothes, you being the only one naked, that you knew of, since you couldn\u2019t see Wanda.</p><p>\tYou could feel the, now warm, metal of the collar still around your neck.</p><p>\tBiting back a groan as you realized one of your ankles was possibly twisted or broken, you asked the boys, \u201cWhere\u2019s Wanda?\u201d</p><p>\tSam\u2019s eyes flickered beside you for a moment. But it was enough for you.</p><p>\tLeaning against the cold concrete wall, you spoke softly to the cell next to you, \u201cWands? How are you doing?\u201d<br>\tYou heard a snort, before her soft Slovakian Accent floated towards you, \u201cShouldn\u2019t I be asking you that? Geez, Stark. They did a number on you and I only heard it, while the boys had to watch.\u201d</p><p>\tWincing, you couldn\u2019t stop the moan of pain as something tugged at your cheeks and liquid fell to the floor from your waist.</p><p>\t\u201cKid. Are you\u2026.Were you\u2026aware?\u201d Scott\u2019s voice was not the bubbly, hyper, positive voice you remembered. </p><p>\tDimly, you were reminded that he had a daughter. And what it was probably like for him to witness what you were almost a hundred percent sure had happened to you.</p><p>\tShaking your head at him, you cradled your arm against you. Sam shouted, \u201cFuck!\u201d Before punching one of the walls of his cell.</p><p>\tClint had tears falling from his eyes as he winced from the sound.</p><p>\t\u201cWanda?\u201d You questioned, your working eye roaming around, looking for any signs of guards of the black ops, \u201cCan you pass a piece of cloth, from your uniform, to me? I need something to wrap around this wound.\u201d</p><p>\tAn intake of breath. And then you could see a strip of red dangling near one of your bars.</p><p>\tStretching out your arm, you grabbed it and felt Wanda let go.</p><p>\tUsing your teeth, you wrapped your arm so that the muscles weren\u2019t exposed anymore, tying off a tight knot despite the shot of pain that was sent through you.</p><p>\t\u201cHow long have I been out?\u201d Your voice still held authority as you fell to the ground to sit with your back against the wall that was connected to Wanda\u2019s cell. </p><p>Your eyes floating up the bright white fluorescent lights as you wondered if your brother was aware of what the government had done, was doing, to you and the team.</p><p>Scott was the one to answer you as Clint\u2019s breathing shuddered under the weight of his tears and Sam paced angrily in his tiny cell space. \u201cRoughly three hours. They\u2026.left you alone about an hour ago.\u201d</p><p>Nodding numbly, you shivered as the cold air of the Raft finally reached your desensitized state.</p><p>\u201c[Y/n]\u2026.\u201d</p><p>You held up a hand, stopping whoever spoke from continuing. You were lost in your thoughts. </p><p>Remembering warm summer nights with Tony. Laughing as Dum-E sprayed him before an explosion went off. Rubbing Tony\u2019s back as you worked with him through a panic attack. Playing cards with the team in the common room of the tower. Blushing when Steve walked in on you working out. Giggling with Wanda and Natasha about the boys. Meeting Scott and cooing over his pictures of his daughter. </p><p>Then arguing with Tony. Throwing a vase as he left your room. Punching a security guard as he tried to stop you from going on a mission. Screaming during a mission briefing as Tony said you were the only one not allowed to go. Listening around a corner as a woman approached Tony about her son who was killed. Overhearing Ross thank the woman and pay her for the lie. Trying to talk to Tony only for him to discard you at every turn. Steve approaching you about Bucky. Hearing about Tony locking Wanda up in the tower. Agreeing to side with Steve after one last attempt to get Tony to listen to you that ended in tears and screams as he blamed you for your parents deaths.</p><p>\u201cLooks like our little plaything is finally awake.\u201d</p><p>You shot the person who spoke a withering look.</p><p>Dressed like a normal prison guard, the scruffy, greasy looking man simply laughed at you, \u201cAw does the kitten have her claws out? What? You seemed to enjoy it when you were unconscious. Body squeezing me just right\u2026\u201d Leering down at you, the man eyed your naked form with a feverous glint in his eyes.</p><p>Your vision went red with hate. When he leaned closer, you took the chance and hocked a huge glob of spit at him, smirking when it hit his cheek.</p><p>\u201cNo\u2026[Y/n].\u201d Clint whispered. Sagging down to his knees as he watched.</p><p>The man leaned over and clicked on his walkie talkie that was clipped onto his shoulder, \u201cPrisoner 5569 seems to be up for more fun. Anyone want to join?\u201d </p><p>And with a sinister smile, the man opened up your cell as feet pounded into the room.</p><p>Screaming, your fists and feet flew from your vulnerable position on the floor against the wall.</p><p>Rough hands gripped your wrists, hands a blur as more joined in, smiling twisted faces of greasy men hovering over you.</p><p>An agonized scream ripped through you at the audible snap of your wrist. The pain rocketing down your arm at the broken bone.</p><p>You were dragged up to your feet and taken out of your cell towards the center of the Raft.</p><p>As your team watched, they dragged your arms up, tying them together with leather and hooking it to a metal hook that was hanging from the roof.</p><p>Your feet swung wildly as your toes barely touched the ground, all your weight now resting on your arms.</p><p>Fresh blood rushed from the giant wound on your arm, soaking through the makeshift bandage from Wanda\u2019s cloth.</p><p>Unbidden, and unwanted tears fell from your face to mark the cement floor as your broken wrist screamed and your hand twisted in an unnatural angle. You could no longer feel your fingers and you knew that was a bad sign.</p><p>Head hanging low, you tried to focus on your team\u2019s voices.</p><p>Scott\u2019s ragged breathing, Sam\u2019s angry yells, Clint\u2019s whispered pleas, and Wanda\u2019s silent strength.</p><p>Your head flew up as a metal pipe slammed into your back.</p><p>A hand to your face.</p><p>A boot to your leg.</p><p>A face between your chest.</p><p>A hand between your legs.</p><p>A gunshot to your hand.</p><p>A whip across your stomach.</p><p>Fingers digging inside your arm, twisting the visible muscle.</p><p>A knife dragged down your spine.</p><p>Laughter. Jeers. Groans. Moans. Screams. Pleas. </p><p>Blood, spit, snot, tears, and various liquids on your face, stomach, dripping down your legs, pooling on the cement.</p><p>As you drew in a breath, about an hour into the torture, now ignoring your team, hating that they were able to see what was happening to you, a static sound pierced the room.</p><p>The men stopped, except the one currently using you.</p><p>\u201cA Tony Stark has landed and has been granted access.\u201d A Monotone AI voiced to the men.</p><p>You didn\u2019t show sign that you heard. You just didn\u2019t care. Your brother had thrown you into this hell. He was responsible. </p><p>As the men frantically tried to clean up. Tony stepped into the doorway. Everyone froze.</p><p>You kept your eyes closed.</p><p>\u201cGet away from my sister.\u201d A cold voice. Tangible anger and terror hovered in the stale air of the Raft.</p><p>Slow, methodical footsteps echoed as more frantic ones ran away from where you were still strung up.</p><p>The sound of a fist meeting flesh and the last man stopped and fled. Leaving you alone in the center of the Jail. </p><p>\u201cOh\u2026.[Y/n]\u2026what did they do to you?\u201d You didn\u2019t bother looking at him. The tears in his voice not doing anything to you. You didn\u2019t have the capacity to care anymore.</p><p>Hands grabbed your wrists, causing an indrawn hiss of pain as the broken one was touched, before you were lowered to the ground.</p><p>Tony stared in horror at his, now blood covered hands.</p><p>\u201cYou caused this. You did this to your own family. Your own sister! Look at what you did Stark!\u201d Sam\u2019s voice was loud, watery, and filled with disgust.</p><p>Your breathing was wet as fluid filled your lungs. </p><p>Hands ghosted over your face, \u201c[Y/n]. Baby. Please wake up.\u201d</p><p>A groan, \u201cI\u2019m awake. Get away from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>You forced your one good eye to crack open and glare at the man kneeling over you.</p><p>He quickly removed his suit jacket when he saw your eye open and pulled it around your limp form, covering most of you.</p><p>\u201c[Y/n]\u2026if I had known. If I knew that-\u201d</p><p>You harsh, barking laughter, accompanied by blood flowing down your chin, cut him off.</p><p>He stared in horror at you as you fixed him with an empty look, still lying prone on the \u00a0cement ground. You couldn\u2019t feel the cold.</p><p>\u201cWhat would you have done, Mr. Stark.\u201d He flinched Backwards when you called him that instead of Tony, \u201cYou would have requested I be put in a different cell? You would have left everyone to rot here while I got five star prison treatment? Should I kiss your shoes? Cry thanks for your concern? News flash\u2026it\u2019s a few hours too late.\u201d</p><p>A coughing fit overcame you. Tony\u2019s hands helping you sit up. Immediately letting go when you snapped your teeth at him.</p><p>\u201c[Y/n]\u2026he\u2019s still your brother. Let him help you.\u201d Wanda finally spoke after hours of being silent.</p><p>Another caustic laugh from you, \u201cSure. A brother who fought with me. Who didn\u2019t believe in me. Who let me be raped. Beat. Cut up and tortured. Who let the government call me a terrorist and place me in here. Who was willing to let me rot in this place-\u201d</p><p>This time Tony cut you off, his hands gripping your shoulders as he yelled at you, eyes wild in confusion and fear, \u201cNo! I wouldn\u2019t! I\u2026I was in talks with Ross about these drastic measures\u2026trying to work it so that all of you would be allowed a lighter sentence in state prison instead. I\u2026didn\u2019t know. I didn\u2019t know! [Y/n], you\u2019ve gotta believe me! I didn\u2019t know!\u201d</p><p>You simply stared, no emotion, as he began crying, as he drug you towards him and buried his face into your shoulder, his tears mixing with the blood on your skin.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He pulled back to look at you, head tilted in confusion. Tears still running down his face.</p><p>You looked right at him. Right through him.</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I will not be the element for your tragic redemption or your backstory. I want no part of you. Of this family. I am no longer a Stark. I want you to leave me.\u201d</p><p>Tony jolted. Your voice was so monotonous. No emotion reflected through it. Not an ounce like he remembered you.</p><p>Not the sister he once had.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201c[Y/n] don\u2019t..\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe left her, I say good for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201c[Y/n]\u2026I\u2019m not leaving you. I\u2019m not going to leave you again. I promise.\u201d</p><p>As Tony went to hug you. You swung your arm with the broken wrist at his face, hitting his cheek, not feeling the pain.</p><p>\u201cI said\u2026\u201d You drew in a breath and then screamed, \u201cLeave me! I am not a Stark! I am not your sister! I am a broken plaything and you are the one who made me this way!\u201d</p><p>Tony scurried backwards on his hands and knees as you began kicking at him. His eyes wide in terror and pain and sadness.</p><p>Your words morphed into an endless scream. Blood dripping from your throat as you tore your vocal chords.</p><p> Only stopping when Tony finally shook himself back to his senses, and with tears on his cheeks and an apology on his tongue, knocked you unconscious with a single hit to your head.</p><p>You had truly become broken. In just the few hours you had spent on the Raft. You were no longer [Y/n] Stark.</p><p>In truth\u2026no one knew who\u2026or what\u2026you were anymore. Your family was gone. Broken. Just like your body. Just like your spirit. Just like your mind. Gone.</p><p><br></p><p><b></b></p><p><b>FOREVER Taglist:</b></p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mueqGDjNU-px9eazPTAiIaw\">@sxph-t</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m6JrH0mInv0_jJIQb7ThoRQ\">@mialeelavellan</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mezyjFsJ8KB5sI8HvSbv3Pg\">@rainydaysrnevergrey</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mR_UCwARCul9gSnnNyDqpOQ\">@platonic-plots</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/maKNWOBDx1gFx-pwWIPIqLA\">@sociallyawkwardcircus-freak-hi</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mXMa1-Lg1MwHvfZ4eHrQ8Pg\">@ayyidkeither</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYmLRg0re4tEdiXOVlxPUfA\">@queenbbarnes</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mMa22YNJDzooYAhgSdAUaHA\">@mythixmagic</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mCCNAjP9ndzMFGDkgSK-_sw\">@chas-z</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mbgCK4NETm23uYtIEABN6-A\">@thefridgeismybestie</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mkPOqWgH7GCQm2YsvdXy7OQ\">@strangersstranger</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mPJVwxDeaQzxOgOZH4jTZ3w\">@princess-evans-addict</a>\u00a0</p><p><b></b></p><p><b>Avengers Taglist:</b></p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mSr3kQd1at8n76VB0yKCV3A\">@jadepc</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mLIpjwC1nGFEZTXugUExGSg\">@marvel-is-a-mood</a></p></p>",

Also, I made Tony sorta an asshole. Sorry not sorry</b></p><p>\t&ldquo;[Y/n]?&rdquo;</p><p>\tThe soft, agonized sound of your name coming from the Iron Man suit floating across the airport from you tore at your heart.</p><p>\tBut you didn&rsquo;t let your face betray your churning emotions. </p><p>\t&ldquo;Tony&hellip;They chose their side.&rdquo; Steve&rsquo;s voice carried across the distance without a need for shouting. The strength in him bolstering your own. </p><p>\tEven though you were Tony&rsquo;s little sister, you did not agree with his way of handling the current issues happening within the Avengers, especially when he locked up Wanda without talking to anyone.</p><p>\tBlood may be thicker than water, and all that jazz, but you needed to stand by your beliefs. Which led to you being on the opposite side of your brother, ready to fight him.</p><p>\t&ldquo;[Y/n]&hellip;&rdquo; You felt, more than heard, the sigh your brother gave. </p><p>\tOnce more your heart pulled at you to comfort him.</p><p>\tFor so long, it had been you two against the world. A distant father who never wanted anything to do with you, a mother who tried her hardest that you barely remembered, because they had been killed during a car accident when you were still a child.</p><p>\tTony had raised you single handedly, and you helped build Stark Enterprise from the ground up after your brother inherited it. You had cried and screamed when the video surfaced of your brother being tortured and held captive in Afghanistan. You had been beside him when Fury approached him about the Avengers initiative. You had teased him for years about his crush on Pepper.</p><p>\tHe had held your hand when you walked to school the week after your parents deaths. He had taught you how to build your own Iron Suit. He had helped you hone your mutation. He had let your cry on his shoulder when your date stood you up and later, he took you out for ice cream after scaring the boy into apologizing. He called you as soon as he escaped and Rhodey found him in the desert. He let you handle the inner details regarding the Avengers Initiative and he was the one who talked to Fury about letting you join. He had teased you about your crush on Steve.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Whatever. Underoos!&rdquo;</p><p>\tAnd a small red bundle flew by and ripped Steve&rsquo;s shield out of his hands and weird white fluid stuck his hands together. </p><p>\tAnd the next thing you knew, you were running alongside Clint towards your former teammates and family member.</p><p>\tUsing your mutation, you kept Rhodey from hitting Scott as he flew through the air on one of Clint&rsquo;s arrows.</p><p>\tKeeping an eye on your brother and Bucky, you kept Wanda safe as she let Bucky and Steve run into the hangar where the Jet was. </p><p>\tRunning, you tried to stop the weird guy in the fursona of a cat, but a swift kick to your head knocked you to the ground.</p><p>\tGroaning, you looked up and a blurry image of a red android floated before you.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Stay down Ms. Stark. For your own safety, please don&rsquo;t resist.&rdquo;</p><p>\tThe calm, cool, and confident voice of the previous Jarvis turned Vision, made its way into your foggy head.</p><p>\tFlopping back down, you heard the rumble of a jet and watched with a satisfied smirk as the jet flew overhead.</p><p>\tVision didn&rsquo;t leave your side, tilting his head at your prone self, he noticed the smirk, &ldquo;You are glad that Rhodey seems to be paralyzed?&rdquo;</p><p>\tYou froze. Your smirk sliding off your face. You squinted at the android. The kick he had delivered to your head still messing with your eyes.</p><p>\t&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p><p>\tVision nodded slowly, no emotion on his face, &ldquo;It seems Rhodey fell at a high velocity and crashed.&rdquo;</p><p>\tYour heart broke for your brother&rsquo;s best friend. The man who was a sort of Uncle to you. </p><p>\t&ldquo;Hands in the air! Raise them up! Stay still!&rdquo; </p><p>\tOrders screamed through the dust settling across the airport. Men in black ops and holding rifles stormed the area.</p><p>\tAs one roughly dragged you up to your feet, you dimly registered that Scott, Clint, Sam, and Wanda were getting similar harsh treatment.</p><p>\tBut Steve and Bucky were gone. You were glad. The mission at least was somewhat a success.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Can I have a word with my sister?&rdquo;</p><p>\tVision somewhat stable now, you turned your head to see your brother, still in his Iron Man suit, his mask receded so that you could see his bruised face.</p><p>\tWincing, you steadied your feet. Staring at your brother, you saw the tired, dead look in his eyes as he looked at you.</p><p>\tThe man holding your arm leaned over and whispered so softly that Tony couldn&rsquo;t hear, &ldquo;Give me a reason to shoot your brains out you freak.&rdquo; Before he let go, only took a few steps back, his rifle still trained on your head.</p><p>\t&ldquo;[Y/n]..&rdquo; Tony groaned, running a hand down his face. Smearing dirt and blood.</p><p>\tYou kept your calm, your voice steady, &ldquo;I know what you&rsquo;re going to say. But I don&rsquo;t regret my decision. You were going to far Tony. The Accords? Really? It would be prison for people like me. We would become weapons sold out to the highest bidder. And You let that man,&rdquo; You spat, remembering how Ross twisted words and lied to your brother, &ldquo;lie to you and you&hellip;the so called genius of this family, didn&rsquo;t look up the validity of his words!&rdquo;</p><p>\tTony flinched as if you had hit him. </p><p>\tHis eyes hardened and he gestured to the man standing behind you. Your arms were twisted behind your back again, the rifle pressed against your skull.</p><p>\t&ldquo;It hurts me to turn you over to the government&hellip;you&rsquo;re still my sister&hellip;I still Love you. I hope you can come to your senses soon.&rdquo; </p><p>\tYour brother&rsquo;s words were soft. But you growled at him, your mutation flaring up before dying away as you remembered the gun at your head.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Shut the fuck up, Tony!&rdquo;</p><p>\tTony stumbled. Vision catching him before he could fall.</p><p>\tYou continued, words falling like acid from your lips, all the rage and betrayal you felt coming into your tone &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t care about me! You never cared about me! You never listened to me or my opinions! You always treated me like glass, like I would break if I so much as tripped! News flash, Tony! I&rsquo;m stronger than you will ever be and I&rsquo;m glad that Steve got Bucky out of here because you have become the Villain in this scenario!&rdquo;</p><p>\tYour wretched scream, that tore at your throat, was accompanied by bitter tears, both fading as you were drug aboard a plane and the gangway slowly closed, encasing you in darkness.</p><p>\tOnce away from the prying eyes of Team Tony, the black ops military men wasted no time in clipping on handcuffs to your team members.</p><p>\tBut, then they pulled you and Wanda to the other side of the plane.</p><p>\tScott pulled at his handcuffs, his eyes wide with worry, &ldquo;What are you doing to them?&rdquo;</p><p>\tThe men didn&rsquo;t respond. And then there was a click and the cold feeling of metal encasing your neck.</p><p>\tLooking over at Wanda, you saw her watching you with horror mirrored in her eyes. She had a collar on her neck, which you figured was what was around yours as well. It was blinking red.</p><p>\tWith a growl, you reached for your mutation, intending to get away from these men and escape with your team.</p><p>\tBut the minute you tried to focus your mutation, your entire body jerked as electricity was shot through you.</p><p>\tA strangled gasp left you as you fell to the floor of the plane, your elbows hitting metal, sending pain through your arms as you tried to protect your head.</p><p>\t&ldquo;[Y/n]!? What did you do to her!?&rdquo; Sam screamed, fighting against the hold of two men while another was removing his wings.</p><p>\tThe leader looked over at him with disinterested eyes, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a prototype. A suppressant collar that prevents them from using their mutations.&rdquo; He turned to look over you and Wanda, a sinister glint entering his eyes, &ldquo;If I were you, I would not attempt to escape. The shocks will grow in intensity the more you try to use your freak powers.&rdquo;</p><p>\tPanting, you rolled over to your knees, your hands cuffed in front of you, pushing yourself to your feet, muscles straining against the tightness that the electricity had caused. </p><p>\tWanda&rsquo;s own handcuffed hands fluttered over you as you let your head loll onto her shoulder. Pain still jolting through your body. If that was the first shock, and if what the man said was true, you didn&rsquo;t want to know what the next shock would feel like. </p><p>\tThe next few hours passed in relative silence.</p><p>\tScott, Sam and Clint spoke to each other in whispers on their side of the plane, shooting you and Wanda the occasional comforting looks.</p><p>\tYou and Wanda stayed next to each other, holding onto each other&rsquo;s hands, grip so tight, you thought you both would lose blood circulation.</p><p>\tThe destination was kept away from you no matter how many times you asked. And each ask got you the same answer&hellip;a fist to the cheek.</p><p>\tBlood dripped from a split lip and your left eye was swollen shut by the time the drone of the engines was cut.</p><p>\t&ldquo;We&rsquo;re here.&rdquo;</p><p>\tMen grabbed your arms, ripping your hands away from Wanda. She whimpered, but kept quiet when you shot her a look of warning.</p><p>\tThe men stood behind her as you stood next to the man in charge, waiting for the gangway to lower. </p><p>\tAnd how you wished you weren&rsquo;t in the front when it did. </p><p>\tA loud roar of crashing waves reached you first before your vision computed what you were seeing.</p><p>\tA floating building. In the middle of the ocean. Rocking violently as the huge swells of sea water crashed against it.</p><p>\t&ldquo;No no no nonononononono!&rdquo; Your words reached a fever scream as you pulled against the arms dragging you forward.</p><p>\tThe words your teammates said faded into white noise as your vision went white in terror. </p><p>\tThe ground that you were now standing on, rocking back and forth, your legs gave out on you.</p><p>\tYou didn&rsquo;t drop though, as the hands tightened on your arms, leaving bruises as they simply continued walking, dragging you now into the building.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Hey! Where are we!?&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;What is this place!?&rdquo;<br />\t&ldquo;We have rights!&rdquo;</p><p>\tThe men laughed at that. Clint scowled. </p><p>\tYou were brought back to the present as you began being dragged down stairs.</p><p>\tYour knees hitting the metal grates, new cuts and gashes and bruises appearing on your skin.</p><p>\t&ldquo;You are traitors to the US Government. Prisoners of the state, and you have no rights. This is the Raft, and it will be your home until the day you die.&rdquo;</p><p>\tStumbling to your feet, you looked around. The floor wasn&rsquo;t moving as bad, but your terror was barely held back due to the knowledge that it wasn&rsquo;t moving as bad because you were under water.</p><p>\tRight now, you were standing before a gate, that almost looked like an airport security scanner. Beyond that, you saw a circular room, with various cells in the walls.</p><p>\tYou were dragged into the airport looking security scanner.</p><p>\tA bored looking guy stood behind a glass window, looking at a computer screen. His voice came through an intercom, &ldquo;Strip.&rdquo;</p><p>\tBaring your teeth, you lunged towards the window.</p><p>\tIgnoring the yells of Clint to stop.</p><p>\tThat was the last thing you heard as you felt a blinding pain to the back of your skull before you vision went dark as unconsciousness took over.</p><p>\t&ldquo;[Y/n]!&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Get your hands off her!&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;[Y/n]!&rdquo;<br />\t&ldquo;No!&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Please!&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Let her go!&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;What are you doing!?&rdquo;<br />\t&ldquo;No!&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Please!&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Please!&rdquo;<br />\t&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;She&rsquo;s unconscious!&rdquo;<br />\t&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t!&rdquo;<br />\t&ldquo;[Y/n]&hellip;.We&rsquo;re sorry&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>\tWhen consciousness finally returned to you. The first thing you noticed was the soreness between your legs.</p><p>\tThe second was the fact that you were naked.\t</p><p>\tAnd the final thing was the amount of blood that was pooled around your sprawled body.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Wanda?&rdquo; Your voice was hoarse, and you had to cough several times to clear it. &ldquo;Wanda? Clint? Sam? Scott?&rdquo;</p><p>\tYou called out for your team. Looking around as you recognized a cell.</p><p>\tA single toilet and a metal bed frame decorated it. Standing up, wincing at the pain you were in, you took stock of yourself.</p><p>\tCuts littered your body. A large gash on your arm had you hissing as you saw the white muscles open to the air.</p><p>\tYour legs were shaky as you realized what had happened while you were unconscious. Bile drew up to your throat. Choking it down, you fought the urge to cry as well.</p><p>\tLimping on bare feet to the metal cell doors, you peered out. Your eye still swollen shut, your face stinging with new wounds that you couldn&rsquo;t see. </p><p>\t&ldquo;Guys?&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;She&rsquo;s awake!&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;[Y/n]&hellip;god. I am so sorry! I tried to get them to stop!&rdquo; Sam reached his hands out through his cell bars. He was directly across from you. Clint and Scott on either side, you could barely make out their faces as the cells curved. You noticed that they were still wearing their clothes, you being the only one naked, that you knew of, since you couldn&rsquo;t see Wanda.</p><p>\tYou could feel the, now warm, metal of the collar still around your neck.</p><p>\tBiting back a groan as you realized one of your ankles was possibly twisted or broken, you asked the boys, &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Wanda?&rdquo;</p><p>\tSam&rsquo;s eyes flickered beside you for a moment. But it was enough for you.</p><p>\tLeaning against the cold concrete wall, you spoke softly to the cell next to you, &ldquo;Wands? How are you doing?&rdquo;<br />\tYou heard a snort, before her soft Slovakian Accent floated towards you, &ldquo;Shouldn&rsquo;t I be asking you that? Geez, Stark. They did a number on you and I only heard it, while the boys had to watch.&rdquo;</p><p>\tWincing, you couldn&rsquo;t stop the moan of pain as something tugged at your cheeks and liquid fell to the floor from your waist.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Kid. Are you&hellip;.Were you&hellip;aware?&rdquo; Scott&rsquo;s voice was not the bubbly, hyper, positive voice you remembered. </p><p>\tDimly, you were reminded that he had a daughter. And what it was probably like for him to witness what you were almost a hundred percent sure had happened to you.</p><p>\tShaking your head at him, you cradled your arm against you. Sam shouted, &ldquo;Fuck!&rdquo; Before punching one of the walls of his cell.</p><p>\tClint had tears falling from his eyes as he winced from the sound.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Wanda?&rdquo; You questioned, your working eye roaming around, looking for any signs of guards of the black ops, &ldquo;Can you pass a piece of cloth, from your uniform, to me? I need something to wrap around this wound.&rdquo;</p><p>\tAn intake of breath. And then you could see a strip of red dangling near one of your bars.</p><p>\tStretching out your arm, you grabbed it and felt Wanda let go.</p><p>\tUsing your teeth, you wrapped your arm so that the muscles weren&rsquo;t exposed anymore, tying off a tight knot despite the shot of pain that was sent through you.</p><p>\t&ldquo;How long have I been out?&rdquo; Your voice still held authority as you fell to the ground to sit with your back against the wall that was connected to Wanda&rsquo;s cell. </p><p>Your eyes floating up the bright white fluorescent lights as you wondered if your brother was aware of what the government had done, was doing, to you and the team.</p><p>Scott was the one to answer you as Clint&rsquo;s breathing shuddered under the weight of his tears and Sam paced angrily in his tiny cell space. &ldquo;Roughly three hours. They&hellip;.left you alone about an hour ago.&rdquo;</p><p>Nodding numbly, you shivered as the cold air of the Raft finally reached your desensitized state.</p><p>&ldquo;[Y/n]&hellip;.&rdquo;</p><p>You held up a hand, stopping whoever spoke from continuing. You were lost in your thoughts. </p><p>Remembering warm summer nights with Tony. Laughing as Dum-E sprayed him before an explosion went off. Rubbing Tony&rsquo;s back as you worked with him through a panic attack. Playing cards with the team in the common room of the tower. Blushing when Steve walked in on you working out. Giggling with Wanda and Natasha about the boys. Meeting Scott and cooing over his pictures of his daughter. </p><p>Then arguing with Tony. Throwing a vase as he left your room. Punching a security guard as he tried to stop you from going on a mission. Screaming during a mission briefing as Tony said you were the only one not allowed to go. Listening around a corner as a woman approached Tony about her son who was killed. Overhearing Ross thank the woman and pay her for the lie. Trying to talk to Tony only for him to discard you at every turn. Steve approaching you about Bucky. Hearing about Tony locking Wanda up in the tower. Agreeing to side with Steve after one last attempt to get Tony to listen to you that ended in tears and screams as he blamed you for your parents deaths.</p><p>&ldquo;Looks like our little plaything is finally awake.&rdquo;</p><p>You shot the person who spoke a withering look.</p><p>Dressed like a normal prison guard, the scruffy, greasy looking man simply laughed at you, &ldquo;Aw does the kitten have her claws out? What? You seemed to enjoy it when you were unconscious. Body squeezing me just right&hellip;&rdquo; Leering down at you, the man eyed your naked form with a feverous glint in his eyes.</p><p>Your vision went red with hate. When he leaned closer, you took the chance and hocked a huge glob of spit at him, smirking when it hit his cheek.</p><p>&ldquo;No&hellip;[Y/n].&rdquo; Clint whispered. Sagging down to his knees as he watched.</p><p>The man leaned over and clicked on his walkie talkie that was clipped onto his shoulder, &ldquo;Prisoner 5569 seems to be up for more fun. Anyone want to join?&rdquo; </p><p>And with a sinister smile, the man opened up your cell as feet pounded into the room.</p><p>Screaming, your fists and feet flew from your vulnerable position on the floor against the wall.</p><p>Rough hands gripped your wrists, hands a blur as more joined in, smiling twisted faces of greasy men hovering over you.</p><p>An agonized scream ripped through you at the audible snap of your wrist. The pain rocketing down your arm at the broken bone.</p><p>You were dragged up to your feet and taken out of your cell towards the center of the Raft.</p><p>As your team watched, they dragged your arms up, tying them together with leather and hooking it to a metal hook that was hanging from the roof.</p><p>Your feet swung wildly as your toes barely touched the ground, all your weight now resting on your arms.</p><p>Fresh blood rushed from the giant wound on your arm, soaking through the makeshift bandage from Wanda&rsquo;s cloth.</p><p>Unbidden, and unwanted tears fell from your face to mark the cement floor as your broken wrist screamed and your hand twisted in an unnatural angle. You could no longer feel your fingers and you knew that was a bad sign.</p><p>Head hanging low, you tried to focus on your team&rsquo;s voices.</p><p>Scott&rsquo;s ragged breathing, Sam&rsquo;s angry yells, Clint&rsquo;s whispered pleas, and Wanda&rsquo;s silent strength.</p><p>Your head flew up as a metal pipe slammed into your back.</p><p>A hand to your face.</p><p>A boot to your leg.</p><p>A face between your chest.</p><p>A hand between your legs.</p><p>A gunshot to your hand.</p><p>A whip across your stomach.</p><p>Fingers digging inside your arm, twisting the visible muscle.</p><p>A knife dragged down your spine.</p><p>Laughter. Jeers. Groans. Moans. Screams. Pleas. </p><p>Blood, spit, snot, tears, and various liquids on your face, stomach, dripping down your legs, pooling on the cement.</p><p>As you drew in a breath, about an hour into the torture, now ignoring your team, hating that they were able to see what was happening to you, a static sound pierced the room.</p><p>The men stopped, except the one currently using you.</p><p>&ldquo;A Tony Stark has landed and has been granted access.&rdquo; A Monotone AI voiced to the men.</p><p>You didn&rsquo;t show sign that you heard. You just didn&rsquo;t care. Your brother had thrown you into this hell. He was responsible. </p><p>As the men frantically tried to clean up. Tony stepped into the doorway. Everyone froze.</p><p>You kept your eyes closed.</p><p>&ldquo;Get away from my sister.&rdquo; A cold voice. Tangible anger and terror hovered in the stale air of the Raft.</p><p>Slow, methodical footsteps echoed as more frantic ones ran away from where you were still strung up.</p><p>The sound of a fist meeting flesh and the last man stopped and fled. Leaving you alone in the center of the Jail. </p><p>&ldquo;Oh&hellip;.[Y/n]&hellip;what did they do to you?&rdquo; You didn&rsquo;t bother looking at him. The tears in his voice not doing anything to you. You didn&rsquo;t have the capacity to care anymore.</p><p>Hands grabbed your wrists, causing an indrawn hiss of pain as the broken one was touched, before you were lowered to the ground.</p><p>Tony stared in horror at his, now blood covered hands.</p><p>&ldquo;You caused this. You did this to your own family. Your own sister! Look at what you did Stark!&rdquo; Sam&rsquo;s voice was loud, watery, and filled with disgust.</p><p>Your breathing was wet as fluid filled your lungs. </p><p>Hands ghosted over your face, &ldquo;[Y/n]. Baby. Please wake up.&rdquo;</p><p>A groan, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m awake. Get away from me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p><p>You forced your one good eye to crack open and glare at the man kneeling over you.</p><p>He quickly removed his suit jacket when he saw your eye open and pulled it around your limp form, covering most of you.</p><p>&ldquo;[Y/n]&hellip;if I had known. If I knew that-&rdquo;</p><p>You harsh, barking laughter, accompanied by blood flowing down your chin, cut him off.</p><p>He stared in horror at you as you fixed him with an empty look, still lying prone on the &nbsp;cement ground. You couldn&rsquo;t feel the cold.</p><p>&ldquo;What would you have done, Mr. Stark.&rdquo; He flinched Backwards when you called him that instead of Tony, &ldquo;You would have requested I be put in a different cell? You would have left everyone to rot here while I got five star prison treatment? Should I kiss your shoes? Cry thanks for your concern? News flash&hellip;it&rsquo;s a few hours too late.&rdquo;</p><p>A coughing fit overcame you. Tony&rsquo;s hands helping you sit up. Immediately letting go when you snapped your teeth at him.</p><p>&ldquo;[Y/n]&hellip;he&rsquo;s still your brother. Let him help you.&rdquo; Wanda finally spoke after hours of being silent.</p><p>Another caustic laugh from you, &ldquo;Sure. A brother who fought with me. Who didn&rsquo;t believe in me. Who let me be raped. Beat. Cut up and tortured. Who let the government call me a terrorist and place me in here. Who was willing to let me rot in this place-&rdquo;</p><p>This time Tony cut you off, his hands gripping your shoulders as he yelled at you, eyes wild in confusion and fear, &ldquo;No! I wouldn&rsquo;t! I&hellip;I was in talks with Ross about these drastic measures&hellip;trying to work it so that all of you would be allowed a lighter sentence in state prison instead. I&hellip;didn&rsquo;t know. I didn&rsquo;t know! [Y/n], you&rsquo;ve gotta believe me! I didn&rsquo;t know!&rdquo;</p><p>You simply stared, no emotion, as he began crying, as he drug you towards him and buried his face into your shoulder, his tears mixing with the blood on your skin.</p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p><p>He pulled back to look at you, head tilted in confusion. Tears still running down his face.</p><p>You looked right at him. Right through him.</p><p>&ldquo;No?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No. I will not be the element for your tragic redemption or your backstory. I want no part of you. Of this family. I am no longer a Stark. I want you to leave me.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony jolted. Your voice was so monotonous. No emotion reflected through it. Not an ounce like he remembered you.</p><p>Not the sister he once had.</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;[Y/n] don&rsquo;t..&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He left her, I say good for her.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;[Y/n]&hellip;I&rsquo;m not leaving you. I&rsquo;m not going to leave you again. I promise.&rdquo;</p><p>As Tony went to hug you. You swung your arm with the broken wrist at his face, hitting his cheek, not feeling the pain.</p><p>&ldquo;I said&hellip;&rdquo; You drew in a breath and then screamed, &ldquo;Leave me! I am not a Stark! I am not your sister! I am a broken plaything and you are the one who made me this way!&rdquo;</p><p>Tony scurried backwards on his hands and knees as you began kicking at him. His eyes wide in terror and pain and sadness.</p><p>Your words morphed into an endless scream. Blood dripping from your throat as you tore your vocal chords.</p><p> Only stopping when Tony finally shook himself back to his senses, and with tears on his cheeks and an apology on his tongue, knocked you unconscious with a single hit to your head.</p><p>You had truly become broken. In just the few hours you had spent on the Raft. You were no longer [Y/n] Stark.</p><p>In truth&hellip;no one knew who&hellip;or what&hellip;you were anymore. Your family was gone. Broken. Just like your body. Just like your spirit. Just like your mind. Gone.</p><p><br /></p><p><b></b></p><p><b>FOREVER Taglist:</b></p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mueqGDjNU-px9eazPTAiIaw\">@sxph-t</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m6JrH0mInv0_jJIQb7ThoRQ\">@mialeelavellan</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mezyjFsJ8KB5sI8HvSbv3Pg\">@rainydaysrnevergrey</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mR_UCwARCul9gSnnNyDqpOQ\">@platonic-plots</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/maKNWOBDx1gFx-pwWIPIqLA\">@sociallyawkwardcircus-freak-hi</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mXMa1-Lg1MwHvfZ4eHrQ8Pg\">@ayyidkeither</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYmLRg0re4tEdiXOVlxPUfA\">@queenbbarnes</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mMa22YNJDzooYAhgSdAUaHA\">@mythixmagic</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mCCNAjP9ndzMFGDkgSK-_sw\">@chas-z</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mbgCK4NETm23uYtIEABN6-A\">@thefridgeismybestie</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mkPOqWgH7GCQm2YsvdXy7OQ\">@strangersstranger</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mPJVwxDeaQzxOgOZH4jTZ3w\">@princess-evans-addict</a>&nbsp;</p><p><b></b></p><p><b>Avengers Taglist:</b></p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mSr3kQd1at8n76VB0yKCV3A\">@jadepc</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mLIpjwC1nGFEZTXugUExGSg\">@marvel-is-a-mood</a></p></p>",

His hands were shaking, spots of dried blood on them. This couldn\u2019t be happening. This shouldn\u2019t have happened.</p><!-- more --><p>May had wanted to take him out to dinner. Just a simple thing. She had burned the meatloaf, again, and figured dinner out was probably a better solution. He fought down a sob realizing he would never see his aunt burn meatloaf again. He would never hear her laugh or the smile she had when she made bad jokes. They\u2019d never get Thai food again. She\u2019d never hold him and promise everything would be okay again.</p><p>It had been raining, hard. May was a great driver. She always bragged that coming from an Italian family meant she knew how to deal with crazies on the road because her fresh-off-the-boat Italian grandparents and her parents were crazy. It wasn\u2019t her fault that another car swerved into her lane. It wasn\u2019t her fault that the car slammed into theirs.</p><p>Peter hadn\u2019t seen it coming. What was the point of having \u2018spidey senses\u2019 if they didn\u2019t do anything? He should\u2019ve been able to protect his aunt. He should\u2019ve saved her. He could still hear the sound of their car slamming into the other. He could still hear screaming, unsure if it was May or his. He could see her, in the driver\u2019s seat, Peter trying to apply pressure to the wound on her head.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay sweetie.\u201d Those were the last words she had whispered to him as the sirens of the ambulance had grown closer, Peter screaming her name, begging that she open her eyes.</p><p>\u201cPeter?\u201d A blonde haired woman, wearing a blue blouse and dark-washed jeans approached him, bringing him out of the memory from earlier in the evening. She had introduced herself earlier, but Peter forgot her name when she said she was a social worker. May was his last living family member. He had no one else. \u201cIs there anyone you want to call?\u201d Peter, with tears still falling down his face, nodded. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go ahead and do that?\u201d Peter got up and walked a little ways away, the social worker giving him the space he needed. He pulled his phone out of his pocket.</p><p>\u201cHey kid, kind of late to be calling,\u201d Peter tried to speak, but instead a sob bubbled out of his throat. \u201cPeter is everything okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cC-can y-you,\u201d He tried to speak through the sobs, taking big gulps of air. \u201cCan you come get me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are you?\u201d There was concern in Tony\u2019s words and a sudden urgency.</p><p>\u201cT-the hospital,\u201d Peter said. He heard Tony suck in a breath. Then, he could hear something on the other end of the call, almost like typing.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be there in fifteen minutes,\u201d Tony said. Peter let out a small sound, almost like a cry of relief. \u201cJust hang tight kiddo, alright?\u201d Peter nodded, but then remembered he was on the phone.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Peter said shakily before ending the call. He walked back over to the social worker, who smiled. \u201cS-someone\u2019s coming for me. T-they\u2019ll be here soon.\u201d The social worker nodded, a polite smile on her face. Peter sat back in the chair, fighting back the tears pouring out of his eyes.</p><p>The minute the call ended, Tony nearly ran to his car. Something was wrong with Peter. He was at the hospital and he sounded like he had been crying for a while. Clearly, whatever was wrong wasn\u2019t Spider-Man related. He had a warning set-up for anytime Peter got hurt while wearing the suit. He sped down the highway, ignoring the honks of angry drivers as he passed. He made it to the hospital in record time. Once he was inside, it didn\u2019t take him long to find Peter.</p><p>The teen\u2019s eyes were red and signs of dried tears were on his face. His hair was messier than usual, like he\u2019d run his hand through it out of stress. There was dried blood on his hands. Why was there dried blood on his hands?</p><p>\u201cPeter,\u201d He said, as he approached the boy. Peter looked up at him.</p><p>\u201cM-mister Stark,\u201d Peter said, slowly standing. \u201cM-may. S-he\u2019s g-gone.\u201d The tears were springing back to his eyes.</p><p>\u201cOh kid,\u201d Tony said, before wrapping his arms around him and hugging him tightly. Peter buried his head in Tony\u2019s chest, his sobs being muffled by Tony\u2019s T-shirt. Tony just hugged him, letting the teenager cry, trying to still the shaking from the sobs. Some people were staring but Tony didn\u2019t care. The kid was upset and needed someone to comfort him.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me,\u201d A blonde woman approached them. \u201cPerhaps we can talk somewhere private?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d Tony asked, eyeing her.</p><p>\u201cAlicia Sharp, I\u2019m the social worker for the hospital.\u201d Social worker. That couldn\u2019t be good. \u201cShall we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s take a walk Pete,\u201d Tony said gently. Tony unwound his arms from Peter.

She had burned the meatloaf, again, and figured dinner out was probably a better solution. He fought down a sob realizing he would never see his aunt burn meatloaf again. He would never hear her laugh or the smile she had when she made bad jokes. They\u2019d never get Thai food again. She\u2019d never hold him and promise everything would be okay again.</p><p>It had been raining, hard. May was a great driver. She always bragged that coming from an Italian family meant she knew how to deal with crazies on the road because her fresh-off-the-boat Italian grandparents and her parents were crazy. It wasn\u2019t her fault that another car swerved into her lane. It wasn\u2019t her fault that the car slammed into theirs.</p><p>Peter hadn\u2019t seen it coming. What was the point of having \u2018spidey senses\u2019 if they didn\u2019t do anything? He should\u2019ve been able to protect his aunt. He should\u2019ve saved her. He could still hear the sound of their car slamming into the other. He could still hear screaming, unsure if it was May or his. He could see her, in the driver\u2019s seat, Peter trying to apply pressure to the wound on her head.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay sweetie.\u201d Those were the last words she had whispered to him as the sirens of the ambulance had grown closer, Peter screaming her name, begging that she open her eyes.</p><p>\u201cPeter?\u201d A blonde haired woman, wearing a blue blouse and dark-washed jeans approached him, bringing him out of the memory from earlier in the evening. She had introduced herself earlier, but Peter forgot her name when she said she was a social worker. May was his last living family member. He had no one else. \u201cIs there anyone you want to call?\u201d Peter, with tears still falling down his face, nodded. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go ahead and do that?\u201d Peter got up and walked a little ways away, the social worker giving him the space he needed. He pulled his phone out of his pocket.</p><p>\u201cHey kid, kind of late to be calling,\u201d Peter tried to speak, but instead a sob bubbled out of his throat. \u201cPeter is everything okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cC-can y-you,\u201d He tried to speak through the sobs, taking big gulps of air. \u201cCan you come get me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are you?\u201d There was concern in Tony\u2019s words and a sudden urgency.</p><p>\u201cT-the hospital,\u201d Peter said. He heard Tony suck in a breath. Then, he could hear something on the other end of the call, almost like typing.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be there in fifteen minutes,\u201d Tony said. Peter let out a small sound, almost like a cry of relief. \u201cJust hang tight kiddo, alright?\u201d Peter nodded, but then remembered he was on the phone.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Peter said shakily before ending the call. He walked back over to the social worker, who smiled. \u201cS-someone\u2019s coming for me. T-they\u2019ll be here soon.\u201d The social worker nodded, a polite smile on her face. Peter sat back in the chair, fighting back the tears pouring out of his eyes.</p><p>The minute the call ended, Tony nearly ran to his car. Something was wrong with Peter. He was at the hospital and he sounded like he had been crying for a while. Clearly, whatever was wrong wasn\u2019t Spider-Man related. He had a warning set-up for anytime Peter got hurt while wearing the suit. He sped down the highway, ignoring the honks of angry drivers as he passed. He made it to the hospital in record time. Once he was inside, it didn\u2019t take him long to find Peter.</p><p>The teen\u2019s eyes were red and signs of dried tears were on his face. His hair was messier than usual, like he\u2019d run his hand through it out of stress. There was dried blood on his hands. Why was there dried blood on his hands?</p><p>\u201cPeter,\u201d He said, as he approached the boy. Peter looked up at him.</p><p>\u201cM-mister Stark,\u201d Peter said, slowly standing. \u201cM-may. S-he\u2019s g-gone.\u201d The tears were springing back to his eyes.</p><p>\u201cOh kid,\u201d Tony said, before wrapping his arms around him and hugging him tightly. Peter buried his head in Tony\u2019s chest, his sobs being muffled by Tony\u2019s T-shirt. Tony just hugged him, letting the teenager cry, trying to still the shaking from the sobs. Some people were staring but Tony didn\u2019t care. The kid was upset and needed someone to comfort him.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me,\u201d A blonde woman approached them. \u201cPerhaps we can talk somewhere private?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d Tony asked, eyeing her.</p><p>\u201cAlicia Sharp, I\u2019m the social worker for the hospital.\u201d Social worker. That couldn\u2019t be good. \u201cShall we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s take a walk Pete,\u201d Tony said gently. Tony unwound his arms from Peter.

She&rsquo;d never hold him and promise everything would be okay again.</p><p>It had been raining, hard. May was a great driver. She always bragged that coming from an Italian family meant she knew how to deal with crazies on the road because her fresh-off-the-boat Italian grandparents and her parents were crazy. It wasn&rsquo;t her fault that another car swerved into her lane. It wasn&rsquo;t her fault that the car slammed into theirs.</p><p>Peter hadn&rsquo;t seen it coming. What was the point of having &lsquo;spidey senses&rsquo; if they didn&rsquo;t do anything? He should&rsquo;ve been able to protect his aunt. He should&rsquo;ve saved her. He could still hear the sound of their car slamming into the other. He could still hear screaming, unsure if it was May or his. He could see her, in the driver&rsquo;s seat, Peter trying to apply pressure to the wound on her head.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay sweetie.&rdquo; Those were the last words she had whispered to him as the sirens of the ambulance had grown closer, Peter screaming her name, begging that she open her eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;Peter?&rdquo; A blonde haired woman, wearing a blue blouse and dark-washed jeans approached him, bringing him out of the memory from earlier in the evening. She had introduced herself earlier, but Peter forgot her name when she said she was a social worker. May was his last living family member. He had no one else. &ldquo;Is there anyone you want to call?&rdquo; Peter, with tears still falling down his face, nodded. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you go ahead and do that?&rdquo; Peter got up and walked a little ways away, the social worker giving him the space he needed. He pulled his phone out of his pocket.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey kid, kind of late to be calling,&rdquo; Peter tried to speak, but instead a sob bubbled out of his throat. &ldquo;Peter is everything okay?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;C-can y-you,&rdquo; He tried to speak through the sobs, taking big gulps of air. &ldquo;Can you come get me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Where are you?&rdquo; There was concern in Tony&rsquo;s words and a sudden urgency.</p><p>&ldquo;T-the hospital,&rdquo; Peter said. He heard Tony suck in a breath. Then, he could hear something on the other end of the call, almost like typing.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be there in fifteen minutes,&rdquo; Tony said. Peter let out a small sound, almost like a cry of relief. &ldquo;Just hang tight kiddo, alright?&rdquo; Peter nodded, but then remembered he was on the phone.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; Peter said shakily before ending the call. He walked back over to the social worker, who smiled. &ldquo;S-someone&rsquo;s coming for me. T-they&rsquo;ll be here soon.&rdquo; The social worker nodded, a polite smile on her face. Peter sat back in the chair, fighting back the tears pouring out of his eyes.</p><p>The minute the call ended, Tony nearly ran to his car. Something was wrong with Peter. He was at the hospital and he sounded like he had been crying for a while. Clearly, whatever was wrong wasn&rsquo;t Spider-Man related. He had a warning set-up for anytime Peter got hurt while wearing the suit. He sped down the highway, ignoring the honks of angry drivers as he passed. He made it to the hospital in record time. Once he was inside, it didn&rsquo;t take him long to find Peter.</p><p>The teen&rsquo;s eyes were red and signs of dried tears were on his face. His hair was messier than usual, like he&rsquo;d run his hand through it out of stress. There was dried blood on his hands. Why was there dried blood on his hands?</p><p>&ldquo;Peter,&rdquo; He said, as he approached the boy. Peter looked up at him.</p><p>&ldquo;M-mister Stark,&rdquo; Peter said, slowly standing. &ldquo;M-may. S-he&rsquo;s g-gone.&rdquo; The tears were springing back to his eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh kid,&rdquo; Tony said, before wrapping his arms around him and hugging him tightly. Peter buried his head in Tony&rsquo;s chest, his sobs being muffled by Tony&rsquo;s T-shirt. Tony just hugged him, letting the teenager cry, trying to still the shaking from the sobs. Some people were staring but Tony didn&rsquo;t care. The kid was upset and needed someone to comfort him.</p><p>&ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo; A blonde woman approached them. &ldquo;Perhaps we can talk somewhere private?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; Tony asked, eyeing her.</p><p>&ldquo;Alicia Sharp, I&rsquo;m the social worker for the hospital.&rdquo; Social worker. That couldn&rsquo;t be good. &ldquo;Shall we?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s take a walk Pete,&rdquo; Tony said gently. Tony unwound his arms from Peter. Peter looked up at him, his eyes still full of tears. Seeing him so broken hurt something in Tony, something he didn&rsquo;t expect. Peter nodded and followed the social worker. Tony followed, keeping a protective hand on his shoulder. That seemed to calm Peter a little, his body no longer shaking from sobs. The social worker opened a door to a small conference room and allowed them to walk in. Tony sat down and Peter sat close to him. Tony squeezed his shoulder and offered him a reassuring smile.</p><p>&ldquo;Because of tonight&rsquo;s tragic and unforeseen circumstances,&rdquo; The social worker began. &ldquo;Peter is now a ward of the state.&rdquo; Peter choked back a sob. He was alone. He had no family left. First his parents, then Ben, and now May. There was no one left to take care of him.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah no,&rdquo; Tony said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to let that happen.&rdquo; Peter looked at Tony, surprised by his response.</p><p>&ldquo;Mr. Stark he&rsquo;s an orphan,&rdquo; She said, trying to be as gentle as possible. &ldquo;The only option is foster care.&rdquo; The word orphan stung in Tony&rsquo;s hair. He knew what that felt like. He couldn&rsquo;t let Peter go through that alone.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have anyone else. I&rsquo;m alone.&rdquo; Peter said before breaking down again. Tony glared at the social worker before turning towards Peter.</p><p>&ldquo;Kid look at me,&rdquo; Tony said. Peter looked up at Tony, his face a mess of tears. &ldquo;You are not alone, alright? I&rsquo;m right here and I&rsquo;m not going to let anything bad happen to you. I&rsquo;ve got you buddy, okay?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You do?&rdquo; Peter asked, trying wipe some of the tears away. Tony smiled sadly and nodded.</p><p>&ldquo;You hear that lady?&rdquo; Tony asked, turning back towards the social worker. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s not a ward of the state. And if you have a problem with that, you can call my lawyers.&rdquo; He stood up as the social worker stared at him in shock. &ldquo;Come on Peter.&rdquo; Peter got up quickly and followed Tony, sticking as close to him as possible. Tony wrapped his arm around Peter, keeping the teen close to his side. Once they were inside Tony&rsquo;s car, Peter turned to look at him.</p><p>&ldquo;What happens now?&rdquo; Peter asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Well you&rsquo;ve got a place to stay at the Tower,&rdquo; Tony said. &ldquo;And if you need someone to take care of you, I&rsquo;m it kiddo.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You really mean that?&rdquo; Peter asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah kid, I do.&rdquo; He reached over and ruffled Peter&rsquo;s hair, earning a small smile from the saddened teen. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get back to the Tower and you can clean up and try to rest, okay?&rdquo; Peter nodded. It wasn&rsquo;t going to be an easy fix. Tony needed to text Pepper and loop her in. There was paperwork to fill out. He knew there was emotional trauma on Peter that was going to take time to heal.</p><p>But Tony was going to be there for Peter. Of that he was certain.</p></p>",
