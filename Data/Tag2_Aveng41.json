We know\nthis about him from very early on, and his story is consistently about\nnavigating between those two wants, so when the choice comes to sacrifice going\nhome versus saving everyone, we feel the gravitas of the moment. This is the\nculmination of his two warring wants, finally coming to fruition.</p><p>What does Steve want? What does Steve sacrifice on the altar\nof doing the right thing, what has he given up in his quest to fight for the world\nthat he needs to reclaim to grow and be happy?</p><p>I honestly don&rsquo;t know.</p><!-- more --><p>He loses certain opportunities as a result of his choices,\nsure (e.g. being with Peggy), but losing things, especially opportunities, that\nyou might have wanted is not the same as consciously sacrificing something,\neven opportunity, especially when those things are lost to snap decisions. There\nis no point at which the right thing is in question, versus the desire for\nsomething, in no small part because the right thing is always stopping the\nimminent danger, and not stopping it would likely also take out the thing Steve\nwants in that moment: in fact it is no choice at all.</p><p>Not putting the Valkyrie in the water was not an option\nbecause auto-guided missiles were threatening millions right that minute, not\nstopping Hydra was not an option, because if the war was lost there was nothing\nleft to want, not fighting Bucky meant letting SHIELDra probably have him back\nand killing millions. <i>Civil War</i> comes closest to presenting an actual\ndilemma, but there was never a choice between things Steve wants and things\nSteve thinks are right: not letting Bucky be killed was the right thing to do\nand also something he wanted, not signing the Accords proved to be the right\nthing and also what he wanted. Argument can be made about the conflict with\nTony, but jury&rsquo;s out on whether their friendship was sufficiently established\nin the MCU, at least from Steve&rsquo;s end. Steve never seems to have to choose\nbetween losing something he wants by doing what&rsquo;s right, or getting it by not doing\nit: what&rsquo;s right and what he wants are always intertwined.</p><p>It ties in with another facet of Steve to contend with, and\nthat is his inability to not make everything his problem. That is a huge factor\nof how something drastic needed to happen before he stepped down and got a life,\nit is, in fact, the clearest example of what Steve needs versus what Steve\nwants. Steve can&rsquo;t seem to walk away from a fight: for all of his life he was\ndoing the right thing because it was the right thing, which mostly meant\nfighting. This is not sustainable, and Steve needed to stop to some degree, but\nstop what, that&rsquo;s the question. Stop fighting all the time, certainly. Learn to\nenjoy victory, build something instead of throwing everything you have at a brick\nwall all the time. Learn to accept that there are things you cannot change, that\nyou shouldn&rsquo;t change, because other people&rsquo;s freedom fucking sucks. In that\nlight going to the past may be just what he needs, finally giving up control,\ngiving up the illusion that if he just tries hard enough he will save everyone,\nbecause all of it already happened. On the surface that works.</p><p>However.</p><p>Learning a lesson like &ldquo;you need to not fight\nsometimes&rdquo; can&rsquo;t be &ldquo;remove yourself from the world and all temptation&rdquo;.\nIt is the narrative equivalent of an opium den. Retreat into a world where none\nof your choices matter, because all choices have already been made.</p><p>Leaving the world he saved would have worked, were he forced\nto sacrifice or lost that which made him fit in along the way, except that\nnever happened. Time and again we are shown that Steve very much belongs in the\nXXI century, that he has a life there, friends, family. Even as early as the <i>Winter Soldier</i> Steve was shown to be very\nmuch at home in the 2010s. Occasionally it was lonely, sure, but so was Tony,\nso was Bruce, so was Natasha. Missing the people of his past is not the same\nthing as missing the past itself. Steve needed to make connections, and by the\nend of CAWS he did: he had Sam and Natasha, and the ball kept rolling. In fact\nby the end of Egg Steve has more people anchoring him in 2023 then he had in\nthe 1940s.</p><p>The last thing is that we are at no point sold the idea that\nSteve truly wants anything concrete. He doesn&rsquo;t even particularly want to save\nthe world, or at least doesn&rsquo;t view it as an attainable goal (with good reason \u2013\nthe world will always need saving, that is the price of freedom). Steve never\nseems to want stability, or a nuclear family, or security, or&hellip; seriously,\nwhat does Steve want from life at any given point? He says in CAWS he wants to\ndo the right thing, but doesn&rsquo;t know what that is anymore, and that is resolved\nby the end. Steve never wanted to work for SHIELD for the sake of SHIELD, he just\nwanted to do his part and SHIELD appeared to enable that. That desire doesn&rsquo;t\nchange. He doesn&rsquo;t give anything up, his wants and needs do not change, only the\ncircumstances do, and even then they don&rsquo;t change enough for him to be forced\nto adjust his perspective.</p><p>Steve\u2019s never been shown to be torn between \u201cI want a\nnormal, happy life\u201d vs \u201cI can\u2019t stand by while evil is afoot\u201d. If anything, his\ndilemmas tended towards \u201cI can\u2019t stand by while evil is afoot\u201d vs \u201cnot standing\nby causes problems\u201d (further weakened because he always ends up justified in\nchoosing the former). Has this been resolved? Has Steve learned to pick his\nbattles, to weigh cost and benefits of engaging depending on the situation? Has\nSteve learned to accept sacrifices in the great war against evil, or does he\nstill consider sacrifices a personal failing that he needs to fix and or undo?</p><p>In the end we don&rsquo;t know, because we are not shown. Or told.\nAll we know is that Steve existed consciously for another century, and either\ntook the opportunity to re-do things that went wrong the first time (not great\nin terms of accepting and honouring the sacrifices of people who fought the\nfirst time, and also not a retirement), or sat back and not only let evil\nflourish, but watched his beloved wife take pride in building the place where\nhe knew it flourished (\u2026yikes).</p><p>\u2026yeah, I&rsquo;m gonna guess: no. Steve didn&rsquo;t learn.</p><p>There is one candidate for want: Egg tries to sell the idea\nthat it\u2019s Peggy, Peggy personally, which&hellip; okay, I buy that Peggy was the\nsingular person with whom Steve ever dreamed of being, so being with Peggy,\nalright. That\u2019s not nothing. That is a very clearly defined want.</p><p>(would help if we knew Peggy spent her whole life waiting\nfor Steve to come back because he was the One Man who could make her happy. Nothing\nweakens that ending quite like the knowledge that the woman has been regressed\ninto the desired prize)</p><p>But it\u2019s also not much, considering Steve is never shown to\nwant the things that going back to be with a woman usually represents, like\nhome and stability and \u201clife\u201d. AoU was a golden opportunity to have Steve\nwistfully look at children running around a farm and be like \u201cah, that\u2019s the\ndream\u201d, but he just looks bemused. So the &ldquo;want&rdquo; is just Peggy, the\nspecific person, however here is the final kick: Peggy-the-person represented something\nwhen Steve knew her in the 40s: she was the kindred spirit that believed in the\nsame things and validated his wants, because those were the same things she\nwanted. They both believed in doing the right thing no matter the cost,\nstanding up to bullies, being true to yourself. The thing is, all of that is\nvoided by the fact that Steve needs to go back to be with her: going to the\npast is not the morally right choice, it is a selfish one. By going back Steve\nnegates the entirety of why he wanted Peggy in the first place, and what he gets\nis just the shadow of Peggy, really, the undefined shape of a beautiful woman\nat the end of the day. In the end the fulfilling of Steve&rsquo;s apparent want is like\ncotton candy. It is pretty, well-shaped, sweet, and exactly what you think you\nwant, except once you get it is nothing but a spoonful of empty calories that\nmelts in the sunshine.</p><p>The problem with Steve&rsquo;s arc is that for all the talk about\nalways doing the unselfish thing Steve has never done anything he didn&rsquo;t want\nto do, and that matters, as context. Steve is never conflicted about fighting,\nSteve is never shown wanting things other than the things he chooses, because\nthe narrative never puts Steve in a position where he needs to choose between what\nis good for someone, and what he feels is right. We never see him grapple with\nthe consequences of choosing his rigid morality at the expense of other people,\nwhich on one hand is fine \u2013 this is not necessarily the right genre for the\nmeditation on the nature of selfishness, but on the other that leaves him with little\nroom to grow, so to have an arc it must be one of selfishness, which would be\nfine, if it didn&rsquo;t play out as a happy ending. It is a deeply unsatisfying\nthought, that always choosing the right thing is so taxing that to be happy you\nneed to eschew it altogether.</p><p>In conclusion: what Steve needs to be happy is to gain the\nwisdom to know the difference between the things he can change and the things\nhe cannot change, and the serenity to accept the latter. Going into the past gives\nhim the opportunity for none of that, because as mentioned above, depending on\ninterpretation, he will have to either accept all things, or claim the power to\nchange all things.</p>",

We know\nthis about him from very early on, and his story is consistently about\nnavigating between those two wants, so when the choice comes to sacrifice going\nhome versus saving everyone, we feel the gravitas of the moment. This is the\nculmination of his two warring wants, finally coming to fruition.</p><p>What does Steve want?

There\nis no point at which the right thing is in question, versus the desire for\nsomething, in no small part because the right thing is always stopping the\nimminent danger, and not stopping it would likely also take out the thing Steve\nwants in that moment: in fact it is no choice at all.</p><p>Not putting the Valkyrie in the water was not an option\nbecause auto-guided missiles were threatening millions right that minute, not\nstopping Hydra was not an option, because if the war was lost there was nothing\nleft to want, not fighting Bucky meant letting SHIELDra probably have him back\nand killing millions. <i>Civil War</i> comes closest to presenting an actual\ndilemma, but there was never a choice between things Steve wants and things\nSteve thinks are right: not letting Bucky be killed was the right thing to do\nand also something he wanted, not signing the Accords proved to be the right\nthing and also what he wanted. Argument can be made about the conflict with\nTony, but jury\u2019s out on whether their friendship was sufficiently established\nin the MCU, at least from Steve\u2019s end. Steve never seems to have to choose\nbetween losing something he wants by doing what\u2019s right, or getting it by not doing\nit: what\u2019s right and what he wants are always intertwined.</p><p>It ties in with another facet of Steve to contend with, and\nthat is his inability to not make everything his problem. That is a huge factor\nof how something drastic needed to happen before he stepped down and got a life,\nit is, in fact, the clearest example of what Steve needs versus what Steve\nwants. Steve can\u2019t seem to walk away from a fight: for all of his life he was\ndoing the right thing because it was the right thing, which mostly meant\nfighting. This is not sustainable, and Steve needed to stop to some degree, but\nstop what, that\u2019s the question. Stop fighting all the time, certainly. Learn to\nenjoy victory, build something instead of throwing everything you have at a brick\nwall all the time. Learn to accept that there are things you cannot change, that\nyou shouldn\u2019t change, because other people\u2019s freedom fucking sucks. In that\nlight going to the past may be just what he needs, finally giving up control,\ngiving up the illusion that if he just tries hard enough he will save everyone,\nbecause all of it already happened. On the surface that works.</p><p>However.</p><p>Learning a lesson like \u201cyou need to not fight\nsometimes\u201d can\u2019t be \u201cremove yourself from the world and all temptation\u201d.\nIt is the narrative equivalent of an opium den. Retreat into a world where none\nof your choices matter, because all choices have already been made.</p><p>Leaving the world he saved would have worked, were he forced\nto sacrifice or lost that which made him fit in along the way, except that\nnever happened. Time and again we are shown that Steve very much belongs in the\nXXI century, that he has a life there, friends, family. Even as early as the <i>Winter Soldier</i> Steve was shown to be very\nmuch at home in the 2010s. Occasionally it was lonely, sure, but so was Tony,\nso was Bruce, so was Natasha. Missing the people of his past is not the same\nthing as missing the past itself. Steve needed to make connections, and by the\nend of CAWS he did: he had Sam and Natasha, and the ball kept rolling. In fact\nby the end of Egg Steve has more people anchoring him in 2023 then he had in\nthe 1940s.</p><p>The last thing is that we are at no point sold the idea that\nSteve truly wants anything concrete. He doesn\u2019t even particularly want to save\nthe world, or at least doesn\u2019t view it as an attainable goal (with good reason \u2013\nthe world will always need saving, that is the price of freedom). Steve never\nseems to want stability, or a nuclear family, or security, or\u2026 seriously,\nwhat does Steve want from life at any given point? He says in CAWS he wants to\ndo the right thing, but doesn\u2019t know what that is anymore, and that is resolved\nby the end. Steve never wanted to work for SHIELD for the sake of SHIELD, he just\nwanted to do his part and SHIELD appeared to enable that. That desire doesn\u2019t\nchange. He doesn\u2019t give anything up, his wants and needs do not change, only the\ncircumstances do, and even then they don\u2019t change enough for him to be forced\nto adjust his perspective.</p><p>Steve\u2019s never been shown to be torn between \u201cI want a\nnormal, happy life\u201d vs \u201cI can\u2019t stand by while evil is afoot\u201d. If anything, his\ndilemmas tended towards \u201cI can\u2019t stand by while evil is afoot\u201d vs \u201cnot standing\nby causes problems\u201d (further weakened because he always ends up justified in\nchoosing the former). Has this been resolved? Has Steve learned to pick his\nbattles, to weigh cost and benefits of engaging depending on the situation? Has\nSteve learned to accept sacrifices in the great war against evil, or does he\nstill consider sacrifices a personal failing that he needs to fix and or undo?</p><p>In the end we don\u2019t know, because we are not shown. Or told.\nAll we know is that Steve existed consciously for another century, and either\ntook the opportunity to re-do things that went wrong the first time (not great\nin terms of accepting and honouring the sacrifices of people who fought the\nfirst time, and also not a retirement), or sat back and not only let evil\nflourish, but watched his beloved wife take pride in building the place where\nhe knew it flourished (\u2026yikes).</p><p>\u2026yeah, I\u2019m gonna guess: no. Steve didn\u2019t learn.</p><p>There is one candidate for want: Egg tries to sell the idea\nthat it\u2019s Peggy, Peggy personally, which\u2026 okay, I buy that Peggy was the\nsingular person with whom Steve ever dreamed of being, so being with Peggy,\nalright. That\u2019s not nothing. That is a very clearly defined want.</p><p>(would help if we knew Peggy spent her whole life waiting\nfor Steve to come back because he was the One Man who could make her happy. Nothing\nweakens that ending quite like the knowledge that the woman has been regressed\ninto the desired prize)</p><p>But it\u2019s also not much, considering Steve is never shown to\nwant the things that going back to be with a woman usually represents, like\nhome and stability and \u201clife\u201d. AoU was a golden opportunity to have Steve\nwistfully look at children running around a farm and be like \u201cah, that\u2019s the\ndream\u201d, but he just looks bemused. So the \u201cwant\u201d is just Peggy, the\nspecific person, however here is the final kick: Peggy-the-person represented something\nwhen Steve knew her in the 40s: she was the kindred spirit that believed in the\nsame things and validated his wants, because those were the same things she\nwanted. They both believed in doing the right thing no matter the cost,\nstanding up to bullies, being true to yourself. The thing is, all of that is\nvoided by the fact that Steve needs to go back to be with her: going to the\npast is not the morally right choice, it is a selfish one. By going back Steve\nnegates the entirety of why he wanted Peggy in the first place, and what he gets\nis just the shadow of Peggy, really, the undefined shape of a beautiful woman\nat the end of the day. In the end the fulfilling of Steve\u2019s apparent want is like\ncotton candy. It is pretty, well-shaped, sweet, and exactly what you think you\nwant, except once you get it is nothing but a spoonful of empty calories that\nmelts in the sunshine.</p><p>The problem with Steve\u2019s arc is that for all the talk about\nalways doing the unselfish thing Steve has never done anything he didn\u2019t want\nto do, and that matters, as context. Steve is never conflicted about fighting,\nSteve is never shown wanting things other than the things he chooses, because\nthe narrative never puts Steve in a position where he needs to choose between what\nis good for someone, and what he feels is right. We never see him grapple with\nthe consequences of choosing his rigid morality at the expense of other people,\nwhich on one hand is fine \u2013 this is not necessarily the right genre for the\nmeditation on the nature of selfishness, but on the other that leaves him with little\nroom to grow, so to have an arc it must be one of selfishness, which would be\nfine, if it didn\u2019t play out as a happy ending. It is a deeply unsatisfying\nthought, that always choosing the right thing is so taxing that to be happy you\nneed to eschew it altogether.</p><p>In conclusion: what Steve needs to be happy is to gain the\nwisdom to know the difference between the things he can change and the things\nhe cannot change, and the serenity to accept the latter. Going into the past gives\nhim the opportunity for none of that, because as mentioned above, depending on\ninterpretation, he will have to either accept all things, or claim the power to\nchange all things.</p>",
