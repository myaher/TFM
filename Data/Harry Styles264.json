Everything has bloomed, the days are longer, and the weather is just perfect. Ethan and I graduated high school a week ago, and we\u2019ve been soaking up our time off.\u00a0However, today instead of being outside and enjoying it; I\u2019m inside laying on my bed next to trusty pal, Lennon, as I scroll through social media on my phone.\u00a0</p><p>The golden retriever lets out a loud yawn that squeaks at the end, and I can&rsquo;t help but laugh.\u00a0\u201cTough life, am I right?\u201d I mutter to him in the imaginary voice I\u2019ve created, in which I think Lennon would sound like if he could talk, all while I scratch between his ears.\u00a0\u201cI feel ya.\u201d</p><p>I turn my attention back to my Twitter feed as I mindlessly scroll through it, until a certain article catches my eye. <i>News From Today, Over the Years,</i> it reads and my face instantly lights up. I <i>love</i> this type of thing. There\u2019s literally an article for every day of the year, and it talks about things that made headlines on this day years and years ago if they were really interesting (which they usually are.) I\u2019ve only fell across this account fairly recently, so I wonder what type of things they\u2019ll have to talk about from this fine June 23rd day, over the years.\u00a0</p><p>There\u2019s a lot of things that has happened on this day. The events listed start dated way back to the war of 1812; and go through many historic events such as the initial release of the Nintendo 64 gaming system back in 1996, and lots of others. I continue scrolling into the 2000\u2032s, and a certain event from 2018 almost makes me drop my phone in utter disbelief.</p><p>\u201cHarry Styles cheats on Y/N at post Madison Square Garden concert party in NYC last night, is this the end?\u201d I read out loud and can&rsquo;t help the feeling as if my jaw just hit the ground. \u201c<i>Pardon?\u201d\u00a0</i></p><p>This article can\u2019t be true, there\u2019s no way. I shake my head in confusion, but hit the link attached to the post to find the original article, and read through it; which leads me to many other news stories similar to the original one. Once I\u2019m finished, I\u2019m at a loss for words. I grip my phone tightly in my hand and roll off my bed to go find the one person I can loose my cool to, and will understand.\u00a0\u201cDarcy!?\u201d</p><p>I stomp down the hallway and the stairs in search of my sister, as I call her name out again.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m outside,\u201d I hear her muffled voice say when I step foot into the kitchen. I make my way to the sliding glass doors that lead to the deck in our backyard, and push them open to find Darcy laying beside the pool; trying to tan. I hate how relaxed she is at a time like this, when I\u2019m basically loosing my mind; and my mood doesn\u2019t go unnoticed by her as I slam the door shut, and let out a huff.\u00a0\u201cWoah, what\u2019s your issue?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDad cheated on mum,\u201d I blurt out and she slowly raises her overly large sunglasses to look at me questionably.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d She says disbelieving and sits up straight.\u00a0\u201cEm, you can&rsquo;t just go assuming things like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not assuming!\u201d I basically yell, and she holds her hands up in defence.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s with all the yelling?\u201d Ethan asks as he comes around the corner of the house from another part of the backyard, and goes to sit beside Darcy on the lounge chair.</p><p>\u201cEmma thinks dad cheated on mum,\u201d my older sister mutters to my twin.</p><p>\u201cEmma <i>knows</i> dad cheated on mum,\u201d I correct, and shake my head at referring to myself in third person.\u00a0\u201cStop making me think I\u2019m going crazy by saying this!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOk sorry!\u201d Darcy says with a raised voice and I walk towards them.\u00a0\u201cBut what in the <i>hell</i> has got you thinking this way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis,\u201d I tell her and show her the article on my phone.\u00a0</p><p>She hesitantly takes it, and let\u2019s Ethan read the screen from over her shoulder as well.\u00a0\u201cOh my god,\u201d she says and begins typing on the screen.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019re you doing?\u201d I ask and go to grab my phone but she moves it away.</p><p>\u201cM\u2019looking this up,\u201d she replies and presses enter on the Google search bar. She scrolls through a few articles and soon starts looking between Ethan and I.\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re right, Em. There\u2019s so many things on this, and it even seems that they broke up because of it. I\u2019m just confused because this is less than a year before I was born.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t even think of that,\u201d I state with wide eyes and take the phone from her.</p><p>\u201cThis was in June of 2018,\u201d Ethan speaks up and glances away thoughtfully, before slowly bringing his gaze back to my sister and I.\u00a0\u201cDarce was born on January 26th of 2019, which means&hellip;\u201d</p><p>\u201cMum was pregnant with me when this happened,\u201d she whispers as tears fill her eyes. I can\u2019t help the gasp that escapes my mouth as she says this, and Ethan looks completely shell-shocked.</p><p>\u201cWe have to talk to them,\u201d I tell my siblings. They go to respond, but stop when the sounds of car doors closing come from the front of the house; indicating that our parents were home. \u201cAnd I guess now is the time.\u201d</p><p>I turn on my heel and make a b-line for the sliding doors again.\u00a0\u201cEmma wait,\u201d I hear Ethan call after me, but I ignore him. I\u2019m on a mission now.\u00a0Once I\u2019m through the doors, I don\u2019t close them because I know my brother and sister are right behind me; and I also know they won&rsquo;t be the ones to mention\u00a0the current issue at hand&hellip; This is all on me.</p><p>I storm through the kitchen and into the hallway just as my parents walk through the front door, and Lennon walks up to greet them with his tail wagging. \u00a0They haven\u2019t noticed me yet, but I start growing nervous as the seconds pass by.</p><p>\u201cHey sweetie,\u201d mum says innocently as she notices me, and steps out of her heels. They\u2019re just getting home from a lunch with Uncle Jeff, and seem happy enough; but I\u2019m absolutely about to ruin it.\u00a0\u201cWhy so glum?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad, did you cheat on mum?\u201d I question without hesitation, and complete shock registers on both of their faces.\u00a0</p><p>They glance at each other and back to me slowly.\u00a0\u201cEmma where is this coming from?\u201d Mum asks in disbelief, and crosses her arms defensively; but I ignore her.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d I ask my dad as our matching green eyes hold each others gaze.</p><p>\u201cBub I-,\u201d he starts but I\u2019m quick to cut him off.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t\u00a0<i>\u2018bub\u2019</i> me, dad,\u201d I raise my voice and run a hand through my hair stressfully.\u00a0\u201cJust please answer the question.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cEmma Anne Styles don&rsquo;t talk to your father like that,\u201d mum snaps and I let out a breathe, not blaming her for being irritated with my sudden outburst.</p><p>\u201cY/N, it\u2019s ok. She\u2019s upset,\u201d dad says gently and places a hand on her arm. His gaze slowly moves back to mine, and he glances behind before sighing in defeat.\u00a0\u201cYes, I did. A long time ago, and it was the biggest mistake of my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad how could you?\u201d Darcy says from behind me, and I turn around to see her standing in the kitchen doorway next to Ethan with tears in her eyes.\u00a0\u201cMum was <i>pregnant</i>.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s really messed up,\u201d Ethan tells him, and shakes his head.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSquish, Slick, if you\u2019d jus let me explain,\u201d dad pleads but it\u2019s really no use. The three of us have heard enough. He looks at me one last time, and I glance between him and mum; both of their eyes beginning to water.\u00a0\u201cSquirt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you&rsquo;d do that to mum,\u201d I whispe,r and look away.\u00a0\u201cShe deserves so much better than that. I-I thought you\u2019s were soulmates.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cEmma just listen, please,\u201d mum begs.</p><p>\u201cI will listen to you mum,\u201d I tell her with a sad smile.\u00a0\u201cBut I really don&rsquo;t know what to say right now. I need to just let this sink in.\u201d I turn to face at my siblings, and they look at me sadly. I walk towards them and the three of us make our way back through the kitchen, to go outside again and away from our parents.\u00a0</p><p>I\u2019m the last to walk through the door, and just as I\u2019m about to be outside I can hear a soft voice.\u00a0\u201cWhat&rsquo;re we gonna do, Haz?\u201d Mum says as I slide the door shut, and go sit down.</p><p>About two hours pass, and it\u2019s been awful. Drace, Ethan, and I have all just sat here in silence; which has really just made me think the worse of my dad&hellip; and I hate it. My dad is my best friend, and I love him to death. I know how much he loves mum; I&rsquo;ve never had to question that before, but now I\u2019m confused. Confused by why or how he could do such a thing, and also what made mum forgive him.\u00a0</p><p>As if reading my mind, the glass doors slide open and mum pokes her head out of kitchen.\u00a0\u201cHey babes,\u201d she says quietly and looks around at the three of us.\u00a0\u201cCan we talk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course mum,\u201d Ethan says from his spot beside me on the chair swing, and shifts so mum can sit between us. Darcy grabs two of the cushions from another chair, and lays them down on the deck to sit on; so she can be close to us.</p><p>I watch as mum gets comfy and she takes one last look at the three of us, before taking a breath.\u00a0\u201cOk. So what would you\u2019s like to know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything,\u201d we all say in unison, and narrow our eyes at each other.</p><p>\u201cWe just want to understand what happened, mum,\u201d Darcy speaks up.\u00a0\u201cThis is all really confusing and unexpected.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand,\u201d mum replies with a sigh.\u00a0\u201cAnd I\u2019ll tell you. See, it all started back at the beginning of May in 2018&hellip;\u201d</p><p><i><b>Y/N\u2019s POV *flashback*</b></i></p><p><i>I was insanely excited. But with the way by right knee nervously bounced up and down, as the plane landed in Hong Kong; you could rightfully think otherwise</i>. </p><p><i>It\u2019d been a long two and a half weeks since the European leg of Harry\u2019s tour came to a close, and I was left in London to work as he parted for Australia&hellip; Saying I missed him was an understatement, and I knew he felt the same. </i></p><p><i>Sure, two and a half weeks apart isn\u2019t the longest we\u2019ve gone without seeing each other; but that\u2019s beside the point. When I managed to get two weeks off work at the beginning of May, I was quick booking a flight to join Harry on tour again for his shows in Hong Kong, Bangkok, Osaka, and Tokyo; before spending another few days with him back home in London, prior to his departure for the South American leg of his tour. </i></p><p><i>When the plane came to a full stop, I was one of the first people off of it; not wanting to wait any longer to see my man. I maneuvered through the crowds of people in the busy airport, and retrieved my luggage before looking for the man occupying my thoughts. </i></p><p><i>I stood on my tiptoes in attempts to see him through the crowd, but it was useless as people just passed by and gave me dirty looks for stopping; and the odd one taking a picture once they realized who this random person was. </i></p><p><i>A sigh escaped my mouth as the want to get out of there grew, so I reached into my pocket to pull out my phone and call Harry; but jumped when a voice spoke up from behind me. </i></p><p><i>\u201cThere\u2019s my fianc\u00e9,\u201d it said and I couldn\u2019t help the huge grin on my face as I turned around and saw my favourite person. I squealed and ran into his embrace as fast as I possibly could; instantly feeling better by having him around again. \u201cMissed you, petal.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cMissed you more, H,\u201d I told him and ruffled my hand through his curls; that were starting to grow out again, may I add.\u00a0</i></p><p>\u201cS\u2019impossible,\u201d he replied and pulled me closer so our lips could meet. I was out of breath by the time he pulled away, and I could\u2019ve smacked the smug look he had on his face when looked down at me.\u00a0\u201cLet\u2019s get out of here, yeah? Before more people notice us.\u201d</p><p><i>His gaze moved to behind me, and I turned around to see a small group of people had formed and were taking pictures of us.\u00a0\u201cOk deal,\u201d I said and grabbed ahold of his hand so we could head to the hotel after he\u2019d taken a few pictures with fans.</i></p><p><i>That night in Hong Kong was&hellip; intimate, to say the least. So was that whole two weeks we\u2019d spent together really, but it wasn\u2019t anything new. Our time together was amazing, but it went by quickly&hellip; And soon he was leaving again, but this time it was going to be a month before I saw him again.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>I invested myself deeply into work, and even started writing again for the first time in a long time during that month. Luckily it went by seemingly fast, and it was soon less than a week before I was to fly to New York City with Anne and Gemma for Harry\u2019s shows at MSG&hellip; but I wasn\u2019t doing too good.</i></p><p><i>\u201cHello,\u201d I groaned into my cell phone without looking to see who it was calling me.</i></p><p><i>\u201cY/N?\u201d Harry\u2019s voice sounded through the device, and I fliched at the sudden noise.\u00a0\u201cAre you alright? Gemma said you were sick.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cM\u2019fine,\u201d I lied, and glanced at my surroundings. I was sitting on the cold tile floor in Harry\u2019s and I\u2019s bathroom in our shared flat, leaning against the vanity after I\u2019d just spent a solid five minutes hunched over the toilet emptying the contents of my stomach. I groaned internally as I wiped some sweat that had collected on my forehead away, and pulled myself into a standing position so I could brush my teeth.\u00a0\u201cNever better.\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a terrible liar, bub,\u201d he said with a sigh.\u00a0\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know actually,\u201d I told him honestly.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ve just woken up and gotten sick every morning for the past few days now, and it\u2019s getting real old. Must\u2019ve caught a bug or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should go to the doctor,\u201d he replied matter of factly and I rolled my eyes.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019ll be fine,\u201d I retorted.\u00a0\u201cBut just for you, I\u2019ll try to make an appointment for tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Gotta have you feeling better for your flight over here,\u201d he said, and I could practically hear the smile I imagined on his face.\u00a0\u201cI miss you, petal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI miss you too,\u201d I explained with a sad smile.\u00a0\u201cSo much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly a few more days,\u201d he stated in attempt to make us both feel better, and my heart fluttered.\u00a0\u201cBut wait, aren\u2019t you supposed to be going out with Gemma today?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d I confirmed as I put the phone on speaker, and spit the toothpaste out of my mouth. I rinsed off the toothbrush, and grabbed my hairbrush to work on that mess.\u00a0\u201cIn like half an hour and then meeting up with Nick afterwards, so I should probably get going, H. And you should get to sleep. It\u2019s after two o\u2019clock in the morning there, and you have a show in Toronto tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, I know,\u201d he groaned, and I rolled my eyes again.\u00a0\u201cWas just worried about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I smiled at his cheesiness.\u00a0\u201cAnd I promise you I\u2019m fine, really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever you say,\u201d he replied disbelievingly.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cCan it, Styles,\u201d I scoffed and he chuckled.\u00a0\u201cBut I really should go. I love you, and will talk to you later, ok?\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cSounds good,\u201d he said, and audibly let out a yawn.\u00a0\u201cAnd I love you.\u201d We said our goodbyes, and I hung up the phone so I could get ready for breakfast with Gemma.</i></p><p><i>After we ate; we met up with Grimmy once his breakfast show was done for the day, and did some shopping. We ended up in a supermarket to pick some things up for Gem, before we were to part; and I was to head home and pack.</i></p><p><i>In the supermarket; I ventured off to grab some snacks I\u2019d been craving before going to look for Nick and Gemma again. I found them in the aisle where the feminine hygeine products were, just as Gem was placing a box of tampons into her basket.</i></p><p>\u201cYou women have it so hard,\u201d Nick stated sympathetically as they turned to look at me, and that\u2019s when it clicked.</p><p>\u201cHoly shit,\u201d I said aloud, and dropped the box of cookies I was holding. Panic started to take over my body, and I began hyperventilating as I looked at the two of them with wide eyes.\u00a0\u201cOh my god&hellip; Oh my GOD.\u201d</p><p>\u201cY/N, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d Gemma asked; concern written well across her features.\u00a0\u201cAre you not feeling well again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m late,\u201d I whispered as tears began pricking my eyes.\u00a0\u201cOh my god, I\u2019m so late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLate?\u201d Gemma questioned, still clearly confused.\u00a0\u201cLate to where?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo not late somewhere&hellip; <b>I\u2019m</b> late,\u201d I tried to explain between shaky breathes.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to have to elaborate, love,\u201d Nick said as I put a hand on my chest in attempt to steady my breathing, and calm the hell down.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cMy <b>period</b> is late,\u201d I blurted out and their eyes widened. These were the two who knew first hand just how sick I\u2019d been recently, and I wasn\u2019t suprised it was Gemma who picked up on what I was getting at first.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOh my- Y/N, do you think you might be?\u201d She gasped as her face lit up, and tried to contain the excitement she was clearly feeling.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I said, and ran a hand through my hair as glanced down at my stomach.\u00a0\u201cBut it makes sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve still lost me,\u201d Nick spoke up and also looked to my stomach, his eyes instantly widening as he registered what we\u2019re talking about. A huge smile took over his features, and he clapped his hands together loudly. \u00a0\u201cNo fucking way! My boy might be a dad, and you might be a mum! This is great.\u201d</p><p><i>Three pregnancy tests, and a trip to the doctor later; it was determined that I was indeed pregnant&hellip; And I was completely terrified to tell Harry.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>I went the next couple of days only also sharing the news with Anne; who was overly excited, and made Nick and Gemma vow to keep it a secret until I was ready to tell Harry&hellip; I decided I\u2019d man up and tell him\u00a0after his second show at MSG, but had to figure out how I was going to do so.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>Anne, Gemma, and I arrived in New York City the day before H\u2019s first concert. I got to spend some quality time with him that day, and we even had a nice romantic dinner&hellip; But I still didn\u2019t have the guts to tell him. We were all here for him. The fact that he sold out Madison Square Garden two nights in a row on his first ever solo world tour was huge, and there was no way I was taking that away from him.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>His first night was a complete success, and I was so incredibly proud. He preformed amazingly, and the crowd was loving every moment of it. Before the show, I\u2019d gone through the stadium to the merch stands and decided to buy myself a purple\u00a0\u2018kiwi\u2019 sweater because <b>someone\u00a0</b>never got me one. The people working at the stand greeted me with huge smiles, and tried to prevent me from giving them any money; but I insisted otherwise.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>I also purchased a hair tie set, and just as I was about to pay I saw the button set; and an I idea formed in my mind. One of the buttons said \u2018I\u2019m Having Your Baby,\u2019 and I couldn\u2019t stand the irony of it. That\u2019s how I was going to tell him I was pregnant. Give him the button, walk away, and see how he handles it&hellip; Great plan.</i></p><p><i>The second night was just as amazing as the first, and so the celebrations that took place afterwards started off in full swing with everyone there. It began with the group of us\u00a0playing pool, but escalated pretty\u00a0quickly.</i></p><p><i>\u00a0Later into the night, Harry was well past the point of buzzed; and was full on sloppy drunk. I hadn\u2019t had one sip of alcohol for obvious reasons, and that didn\u2019t go unnoticed by Harry. However, I was able to brush it off as it being because I was still sick; the fact that I\u2019d spent a good twenty minutes next to the toilet that morning was enough for him to go along with that story.</i></p><p><i>I\u2019d separated myself from the group as it became very crowded, and my stomach began to churn. I rushed to the washroom and emptied my stomach once again; hoping the little squish in there would give me some relief from the nausea sooner rather than later.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>I flushed the toilet and went to wash my hands; making a mental note to get some more water to try to get the taste of vomit out of my mouth. I finished rinsing the soap off my hands just as the washroom door swung open, and two pairs of footsteps walked in.</i></p><p>\u201cY/N there you are,\u201d a voice said and I turned to see Sarah and Clare smiling back at me.\u00a0</p><p><i>\u201cHey ladies,\u201d I greeted them with a genuine smile.\u00a0\u201cHaving fun? You\u2019s did amazing tonight by the way.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou\u2019re too kind,\u201d Sarah replied.\u00a0\u201cBut this place is filling up pretty fast with people, I may see if Mitch wants to leave soon before it get\u2019s too crowded.\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ready to call it a night as well,\u201d Clare added. \u201cWe could all just head back to the hotel together.\u201d I nodded in agreement; extremely exhausted from the past few days, and still kind of jet lagged.\u00a0\u201cAdam\u2019s already left to be with the kids&hellip; But speaking of kids&hellip; Is it true Y/N?\u201d</p><p><i>I looked at her oddly before I\u2019d registered what she was asking, and my eyes widened.\u00a0\u201cUhm I uh,\u201d I stuttered and the two of them chuckled.</i></p><p>\u201cShe totally\u2019s got a bun in the oven,\u201d Sarah said, causing my face to redden. She smiles at me gently before glancing at Clare.\u00a0\u201cAnne may have told us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d I muttered.\u00a0\u201cWait, Harry doesn\u2019t know yet does he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo hun, you\u2019re fine,\u201d Clare stated and stepped towards me.\u00a0\u201cJust us, Mitch, Adam, and whoever else you\u2019ve told.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOk good,\u201d I said and patted the button that was in my pocket.\u00a0\u201cI was going to tell him tonight, but it may have to wait until morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnderstandable,\u201d Sarah replied and I smiled.\u00a0\u201cNow I don\u2019t know about you two, but I\u2019m ready to go wander this city a bit and eventually get some sleep.\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cI hear you on that one,\u201d I told her.\u00a0\u201cI think I\u2019ll go collect my boyfriend.\u201d The two girls nodded in understanding, and we all made our way back to where everyone was.</i></p><p>We made small talk as we went, and just as we were about to round the corner; an aggravated voice was raised.\u00a0\u201cHarry, that\u2019s not Y/N!\u201d</p><p><i>I stepped around the corner with Sarah and Clare behind me, and was met by one of the worst sights I\u2019d ever seen in my entire life. No more than five feet away was Mitch desperately trying to pull Harry away from a girl he was full on making out with. My heart plummeted as I watched his right hand tangle into the girls same coloured hair as me, and his left hand grab a handful of the somewhat similar looking dress to what I was wearing; all while who I\u2019m assuming were the girls friends snickered, and took photos from a few more feet away.</i></p><p>\u201cOh my god,\u201d Clare said and a sob escaped my mouth.\u00a0</p><p><i>Hurt, anger, betrayl, sadness, pregnancy hormones&hellip; It was all racing through me as Harry finally let himself be pulled away from the girl, and turned around to give Mitch a glare. I watched as he went to say something, but then his gaze moved back and was met by my tear filled one. His eyes widened as soon as he noticed me, and he instantly moved in my direction; glancing between me and the other girl as if realizing we were two different people.</i></p><p><i>I quickly turned on my heel, and tried to make a b-line for the exit out of there.\u00a0\u201cY/N, wait!\u201d Harry\u2019s voice called after me, but I couldn\u2019t care less as I continued for the door; until a hand wrapped around my wrist and held me back.\u00a0\u201cLet me explain.\u201d</i></p><p><i>I let out a sarcastic laugh as the tears streamed from my eyes, before I whipped around to face him.\u00a0\u201cNo Harry, you don\u2019t get to explain,\u201d I yelled and ripped my arm away from his hold. His features were evident with shock, and even fear as he visibly was sobering up; but was all replaced with desperation as my hand moved to my left ring finger. I slid off the engagement ring he had proposed to me with, and grabbed his hand. I pryed open his fingers from the fist he had them in, before placing the ring on his palm and closing his fingers around it. \u201cI want you to stay away from me.\u201d I told him as my eyes met his tear filled green ones, and\u00a0I reached into my pocket to grab the button.\u00a0\u201cAnd I want you to stay the </i><b><i>hell</i></b><i> away from this baby.\u201d\u00a0</i></p><p><i>I chucked the button at his feet, and turned away from him; not allowing myself to see his reaction as I went out the door and hopped into the nearest cab, driving off and not looking back.</i></p><p><i><b>Emma\u2019s POV *back in present*</b></i></p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s how it all happened,\u201d mum says and concludes her story, as Darcy, Ethan, and I stare at her in awe.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSo it was a drunken mistake,\u201d Ethan states and looks at the ground; trying to wrap his head around the whole thing.\u00a0\u201cDid this girl even look like you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom a distance, yes,\u201d mum tells him with a nod.\u00a0\u201cBut I was pretty caught up in the moment, I didn\u2019t even register that part of it at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don&rsquo;t think anyone could expect you too, mum,\u201d Darcy speaks up, and I nod my head in agreement.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhen I found out your father made out with this other girl because he thought she was me, I felt like I was crazy for the way I reacted,\u201d she continues to explain.\u00a0\u201cBut I couldn\u2019t help it, it just hurt so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bet no one blamed you for the way you reacted,\u201d I tell her honestly.\u00a0\u201cPlus you were pregnant, that would\u2019ve only made it so much harder to control your emotions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got that right, Squirt,\u201d my dad\u2019s voice speaks up as he walks over to the four of us.\u00a0\u201cIs it alright if I join?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess,\u201d I say dramatically, but shift over a bit so he can sit between mum and I.

Even your Uncle Jeff took part in that, and I\u2019d even received a call from Grimmy trying to convince me to do the same;\u00a0but I wasn\u2019t having it.\u201d Mum continues to explain.\u00a0\u201cThe week had almost fully gone by, and I was preparing for my flight back to London when I got a call from your Uncle Mitch. Mitch never called me so I knew it was <i>something</i> worth listening too, which is why I answered. I barely got a hello in, before he completely went off about the whole thing. He explained the entire situation, from how your dad\u2019s actions with that girl happened because he thought it was me, to how completely and utterly distraught he was after the whole thing happened. And it gave me a different perspective.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for Mitch doing that, I may have never gotten that call from your mum, and we may have never worked it out,\u201d dad adds in.\u00a0\u201cThe whole thing happened because of my stupidity, and I\u2019m still so happy your mum gave another chance; even thought I didn\u2019t deserve it.\u00a0But words also can\u2019t express how thankful I am that Mitch called her, because otherwise she may have never\u00a0listened. And we may not be where we are now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEth, if Uncle Mitch didn\u2019t do that we may have never been born,\u201d I state in shock as I lean forward to look at my twin.</p><p>Mum and dad both laugh at my statement, but I thought it was valid.\u00a0\u201cI guess you\u2019re right, Em,\u201d mum says.\u00a0\u201cYour\u00a0Uncle Mitch and I became a lot closer after that. I was always close with Sarah, Clare, and Adam; not saying I wasn\u2019t with Mitch, but he\u00a0sometimes is just so quiet, and it can come off as him distancing himself. Nonetheless, after your dad and I worked things out, and the tour had ended; we called the engagement back on, and we began planning our future life as parents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it all turned out pretty well,\u201d Darcy speaks up again from her spot on the gound.\u00a0\u201cBut hey, that\u2019s totally why Aunt Sarah and Uncle Mitch are my godparents isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat it is, Squish,\u201d dad replies, and sends her a wink as he moves to stand up.\u00a0\u201cBut now that you\u2019s know all of this, I vote we go eat some dinner. It\u2019s been a long couple hours, yeah?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt really has,\u201d mum agrees and squeezes his knee. They both stand up and snake each others arm around the other\u2019s waist. I watch as they both look at each other lovingly, and dad leans down to plant a soft kiss on her lips; causing my heart to freaking melt.\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019ll go make something, and call you\u2019s when it\u2019s ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think she means dad will make something, because he doesn\u2019t let her help out of fear she\u2019ll burn the food,\u201d Ethan mutters, and earns himself a scowl from mum as dad laughs. She goes to say something, but dad is quick to distract her and pull her into the house; all while trying to keep himself from laughing harder.\u00a0\u201cSometimes their sappiness is nauseating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes you\u2019re nauseating,\u201d I snap at my twin with a scoff.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cGeez Em,\u201d Dracy spits out between laughs at my statement, and Ethan rolls his eyes.</p><p>I smile down at my big sister, and move my gaze back to the doors where I can see dad playfully trying to whip mum with a dish towel as he chases her around the kitchen, and can\u2019t help but smile.\u00a0\u201cAll I know is that if I don\u2019t have a love like theirs, it\u2019s not even worth it.\u201d</p>",

Everything has bloomed, the days are longer, and the weather is just perfect. Ethan and I graduated high school a week ago, and we\u2019ve been soaking up our time off.\u00a0However, today instead of being outside and enjoying it; I\u2019m inside laying on my bed next to trusty pal, Lennon, as I scroll through social media on my phone.\u00a0</p><p>The golden retriever lets out a loud yawn that squeaks at the end, and I can\u2019t help but laugh.\u00a0\u201cTough life, am I right?\u201d I mutter to him in the imaginary voice I\u2019ve created, in which I think Lennon would sound like if he could talk, all while I scratch between his ears.\u00a0\u201cI feel ya.\u201d</p><p>I turn my attention back to my Twitter feed as I mindlessly scroll through it, until a certain article catches my eye. <i>News From Today, Over the Years,</i> it reads and my face instantly lights up. I <i>love</i> this type of thing. There\u2019s literally an article for every day of the year, and it talks about things that made headlines on this day years and years ago if they were really interesting (which they usually are.) I\u2019ve only fell across this account fairly recently, so I wonder what type of things they\u2019ll have to talk about from this fine June 23rd day, over the years.\u00a0</p><p>There\u2019s a lot of things that has happened on this day. The events listed start dated way back to the war of 1812; and go through many historic events such as the initial release of the Nintendo 64 gaming system back in 1996, and lots of others. I continue scrolling into the 2000\u2032s, and a certain event from 2018 almost makes me drop my phone in utter disbelief.</p><p>\u201cHarry Styles cheats on Y/N at post Madison Square Garden concert party in NYC last night, is this the end?\u201d I read out loud and can\u2019t help the feeling as if my jaw just hit the ground. \u201c<i>Pardon?\u201d\u00a0</i></p><p>This article can\u2019t be true, there\u2019s no way. I shake my head in confusion, but hit the link attached to the post to find the original article, and read through it; which leads me to many other news stories similar to the original one. Once I\u2019m finished, I\u2019m at a loss for words. I grip my phone tightly in my hand and roll off my bed to go find the one person I can loose my cool to, and will understand.\u00a0\u201cDarcy!?\u201d</p><p>I stomp down the hallway and the stairs in search of my sister, as I call her name out again.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m outside,\u201d I hear her muffled voice say when I step foot into the kitchen. I make my way to the sliding glass doors that lead to the deck in our backyard, and push them open to find Darcy laying beside the pool; trying to tan. I hate how relaxed she is at a time like this, when I\u2019m basically loosing my mind; and my mood doesn\u2019t go unnoticed by her as I slam the door shut, and let out a huff.\u00a0\u201cWoah, what\u2019s your issue?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDad cheated on mum,\u201d I blurt out and she slowly raises her overly large sunglasses to look at me questionably.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d She says disbelieving and sits up straight.\u00a0\u201cEm, you can\u2019t just go assuming things like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not assuming!\u201d I basically yell, and she holds her hands up in defence.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s with all the yelling?\u201d Ethan asks as he comes around the corner of the house from another part of the backyard, and goes to sit beside Darcy on the lounge chair.</p><p>\u201cEmma thinks dad cheated on mum,\u201d my older sister mutters to my twin.</p><p>\u201cEmma <i>knows</i> dad cheated on mum,\u201d I correct, and shake my head at referring to myself in third person.\u00a0\u201cStop making me think I\u2019m going crazy by saying this!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOk sorry!\u201d Darcy says with a raised voice and I walk towards them.\u00a0\u201cBut what in the <i>hell</i> has got you thinking this way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis,\u201d I tell her and show her the article on my phone.\u00a0</p><p>She hesitantly takes it, and let\u2019s Ethan read the screen from over her shoulder as well.\u00a0\u201cOh my god,\u201d she says and begins typing on the screen.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019re you doing?\u201d I ask and go to grab my phone but she moves it away.</p><p>\u201cM\u2019looking this up,\u201d she replies and presses enter on the Google search bar. She scrolls through a few articles and soon starts looking between Ethan and I.\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re right, Em. There\u2019s so many things on this, and it even seems that they broke up because of it. I\u2019m just confused because this is less than a year before I was born.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t even think of that,\u201d I state with wide eyes and take the phone from her.</p><p>\u201cThis was in June of 2018,\u201d Ethan speaks up and glances away thoughtfully, before slowly bringing his gaze back to my sister and I.\u00a0\u201cDarce was born on January 26th of 2019, which means\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cMum was pregnant with me when this happened,\u201d she whispers as tears fill her eyes. I can\u2019t help the gasp that escapes my mouth as she says this, and Ethan looks completely shell-shocked.</p><p>\u201cWe have to talk to them,\u201d I tell my siblings. They go to respond, but stop when the sounds of car doors closing come from the front of the house; indicating that our parents were home. \u201cAnd I guess now is the time.\u201d</p><p>I turn on my heel and make a b-line for the sliding doors again.\u00a0\u201cEmma wait,\u201d I hear Ethan call after me, but I ignore him. I\u2019m on a mission now.\u00a0Once I\u2019m through the doors, I don\u2019t close them because I know my brother and sister are right behind me; and I also know they won\u2019t be the ones to mention\u00a0the current issue at hand\u2026 This is all on me.</p><p>I storm through the kitchen and into the hallway just as my parents walk through the front door, and Lennon walks up to greet them with his tail wagging. \u00a0They haven\u2019t noticed me yet, but I start growing nervous as the seconds pass by.</p><p>\u201cHey sweetie,\u201d mum says innocently as she notices me, and steps out of her heels. They\u2019re just getting home from a lunch with Uncle Jeff, and seem happy enough; but I\u2019m absolutely about to ruin it.\u00a0\u201cWhy so glum?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad, did you cheat on mum?\u201d I question without hesitation, and complete shock registers on both of their faces.\u00a0</p><p>They glance at each other and back to me slowly.\u00a0\u201cEmma where is this coming from?\u201d Mum asks in disbelief, and crosses her arms defensively; but I ignore her.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d I ask my dad as our matching green eyes hold each others gaze.</p><p>\u201cBub I-,\u201d he starts but I\u2019m quick to cut him off.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t\u00a0<i>\u2018bub\u2019</i> me, dad,\u201d I raise my voice and run a hand through my hair stressfully.\u00a0\u201cJust please answer the question.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cEmma Anne Styles don\u2019t talk to your father like that,\u201d mum snaps and I let out a breathe, not blaming her for being irritated with my sudden outburst.</p><p>\u201cY/N, it\u2019s ok. She\u2019s upset,\u201d dad says gently and places a hand on her arm. His gaze slowly moves back to mine, and he glances behind before sighing in defeat.\u00a0\u201cYes, I did. A long time ago, and it was the biggest mistake of my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad how could you?\u201d Darcy says from behind me, and I turn around to see her standing in the kitchen doorway next to Ethan with tears in her eyes.\u00a0\u201cMum was <i>pregnant</i>.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s really messed up,\u201d Ethan tells him, and shakes his head.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSquish, Slick, if you\u2019d jus let me explain,\u201d dad pleads but it\u2019s really no use. The three of us have heard enough. He looks at me one last time, and I glance between him and mum; both of their eyes beginning to water.\u00a0\u201cSquirt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019d do that to mum,\u201d I whispe,r and look away.\u00a0\u201cShe deserves so much better than that. I-I thought you\u2019s were soulmates.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cEmma just listen, please,\u201d mum begs.</p><p>\u201cI will listen to you mum,\u201d I tell her with a sad smile.\u00a0\u201cBut I really don\u2019t know what to say right now. I need to just let this sink in.\u201d I turn to face at my siblings, and they look at me sadly. I walk towards them and the three of us make our way back through the kitchen, to go outside again and away from our parents.\u00a0</p><p>I\u2019m the last to walk through the door, and just as I\u2019m about to be outside I can hear a soft voice.\u00a0\u201cWhat\u2019re we gonna do, Haz?\u201d Mum says as I slide the door shut, and go sit down.</p><p>About two hours pass, and it\u2019s been awful. Drace, Ethan, and I have all just sat here in silence; which has really just made me think the worse of my dad\u2026 and I hate it. My dad is my best friend, and I love him to death. I know how much he loves mum; I\u2019ve never had to question that before, but now I\u2019m confused. Confused by why or how he could do such a thing, and also what made mum forgive him.\u00a0</p><p>As if reading my mind, the glass doors slide open and mum pokes her head out of kitchen.\u00a0\u201cHey babes,\u201d she says quietly and looks around at the three of us.\u00a0\u201cCan we talk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course mum,\u201d Ethan says from his spot beside me on the chair swing, and shifts so mum can sit between us. Darcy grabs two of the cushions from another chair, and lays them down on the deck to sit on; so she can be close to us.</p><p>I watch as mum gets comfy and she takes one last look at the three of us, before taking a breath.\u00a0\u201cOk. So what would you\u2019s like to know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything,\u201d we all say in unison, and narrow our eyes at each other.</p><p>\u201cWe just want to understand what happened, mum,\u201d Darcy speaks up.\u00a0\u201cThis is all really confusing and unexpected.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand,\u201d mum replies with a sigh.\u00a0\u201cAnd I\u2019ll tell you. See, it all started back at the beginning of May in 2018\u2026\u201d</p><p><i><b>Y/N\u2019s POV *flashback*</b></i></p><p><i>I was insanely excited. But with the way by right knee nervously bounced up and down, as the plane landed in Hong Kong; you could rightfully think otherwise</i>. </p><p><i>It\u2019d been a long two and a half weeks since the European leg of Harry\u2019s tour came to a close, and I was left in London to work as he parted for Australia\u2026 Saying I missed him was an understatement, and I knew he felt the same. </i></p><p><i>Sure, two and a half weeks apart isn\u2019t the longest we\u2019ve gone without seeing each other; but that\u2019s beside the point. When I managed to get two weeks off work at the beginning of May, I was quick booking a flight to join Harry on tour again for his shows in Hong Kong, Bangkok, Osaka, and Tokyo; before spending another few days with him back home in London, prior to his departure for the South American leg of his tour. </i></p><p><i>When the plane came to a full stop, I was one of the first people off of it; not wanting to wait any longer to see my man. I maneuvered through the crowds of people in the busy airport, and retrieved my luggage before looking for the man occupying my thoughts. </i></p><p><i>I stood on my tiptoes in attempts to see him through the crowd, but it was useless as people just passed by and gave me dirty looks for stopping; and the odd one taking a picture once they realized who this random person was. </i></p><p><i>A sigh escaped my mouth as the want to get out of there grew, so I reached into my pocket to pull out my phone and call Harry; but jumped when a voice spoke up from behind me. </i></p><p><i>\u201cThere\u2019s my fianc\u00e9,\u201d it said and I couldn\u2019t help the huge grin on my face as I turned around and saw my favourite person. I squealed and ran into his embrace as fast as I possibly could; instantly feeling better by having him around again. \u201cMissed you, petal.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cMissed you more, H,\u201d I told him and ruffled my hand through his curls; that were starting to grow out again, may I add.\u00a0</i></p><p>\u201cS\u2019impossible,\u201d he replied and pulled me closer so our lips could meet. I was out of breath by the time he pulled away, and I could\u2019ve smacked the smug look he had on his face when looked down at me.\u00a0\u201cLet\u2019s get out of here, yeah? Before more people notice us.\u201d</p><p><i>His gaze moved to behind me, and I turned around to see a small group of people had formed and were taking pictures of us.\u00a0\u201cOk deal,\u201d I said and grabbed ahold of his hand so we could head to the hotel after he\u2019d taken a few pictures with fans.</i></p><p><i>That night in Hong Kong was\u2026 intimate, to say the least. So was that whole two weeks we\u2019d spent together really, but it wasn\u2019t anything new. Our time together was amazing, but it went by quickly\u2026 And soon he was leaving again, but this time it was going to be a month before I saw him again.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>I invested myself deeply into work, and even started writing again for the first time in a long time during that month. Luckily it went by seemingly fast, and it was soon less than a week before I was to fly to New York City with Anne and Gemma for Harry\u2019s shows at MSG\u2026 but I wasn\u2019t doing too good.</i></p><p><i>\u201cHello,\u201d I groaned into my cell phone without looking to see who it was calling me.</i></p><p><i>\u201cY/N?\u201d Harry\u2019s voice sounded through the device, and I fliched at the sudden noise.\u00a0\u201cAre you alright? Gemma said you were sick.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cM\u2019fine,\u201d I lied, and glanced at my surroundings. I was sitting on the cold tile floor in Harry\u2019s and I\u2019s bathroom in our shared flat, leaning against the vanity after I\u2019d just spent a solid five minutes hunched over the toilet emptying the contents of my stomach. I groaned internally as I wiped some sweat that had collected on my forehead away, and pulled myself into a standing position so I could brush my teeth.\u00a0\u201cNever better.\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a terrible liar, bub,\u201d he said with a sigh.\u00a0\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know actually,\u201d I told him honestly.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ve just woken up and gotten sick every morning for the past few days now, and it\u2019s getting real old. Must\u2019ve caught a bug or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should go to the doctor,\u201d he replied matter of factly and I rolled my eyes.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019ll be fine,\u201d I retorted.\u00a0\u201cBut just for you, I\u2019ll try to make an appointment for tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Gotta have you feeling better for your flight over here,\u201d he said, and I could practically hear the smile I imagined on his face.\u00a0\u201cI miss you, petal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI miss you too,\u201d I explained with a sad smile.\u00a0\u201cSo much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly a few more days,\u201d he stated in attempt to make us both feel better, and my heart fluttered.\u00a0\u201cBut wait, aren\u2019t you supposed to be going out with Gemma today?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d I confirmed as I put the phone on speaker, and spit the toothpaste out of my mouth. I rinsed off the toothbrush, and grabbed my hairbrush to work on that mess.\u00a0\u201cIn like half an hour and then meeting up with Nick afterwards, so I should probably get going, H. And you should get to sleep. It\u2019s after two o\u2019clock in the morning there, and you have a show in Toronto tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, I know,\u201d he groaned, and I rolled my eyes again.\u00a0\u201cWas just worried about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I smiled at his cheesiness.\u00a0\u201cAnd I promise you I\u2019m fine, really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever you say,\u201d he replied disbelievingly.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cCan it, Styles,\u201d I scoffed and he chuckled.\u00a0\u201cBut I really should go. I love you, and will talk to you later, ok?\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cSounds good,\u201d he said, and audibly let out a yawn.\u00a0\u201cAnd I love you.\u201d We said our goodbyes, and I hung up the phone so I could get ready for breakfast with Gemma.</i></p><p><i>After we ate; we met up with Grimmy once his breakfast show was done for the day, and did some shopping. We ended up in a supermarket to pick some things up for Gem, before we were to part; and I was to head home and pack.</i></p><p><i>In the supermarket; I ventured off to grab some snacks I\u2019d been craving before going to look for Nick and Gemma again. I found them in the aisle where the feminine hygeine products were, just as Gem was placing a box of tampons into her basket.</i></p><p>\u201cYou women have it so hard,\u201d Nick stated sympathetically as they turned to look at me, and that\u2019s when it clicked.</p><p>\u201cHoly shit,\u201d I said aloud, and dropped the box of cookies I was holding. Panic started to take over my body, and I began hyperventilating as I looked at the two of them with wide eyes.\u00a0\u201cOh my god\u2026 Oh my GOD.\u201d</p><p>\u201cY/N, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d Gemma asked; concern written well across her features.\u00a0\u201cAre you not feeling well again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m late,\u201d I whispered as tears began pricking my eyes.\u00a0\u201cOh my god, I\u2019m so late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLate?\u201d Gemma questioned, still clearly confused.\u00a0\u201cLate to where?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo not late somewhere\u2026 <b>I\u2019m</b> late,\u201d I tried to explain between shaky breathes.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to have to elaborate, love,\u201d Nick said as I put a hand on my chest in attempt to steady my breathing, and calm the hell down.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cMy <b>period</b> is late,\u201d I blurted out and their eyes widened. These were the two who knew first hand just how sick I\u2019d been recently, and I wasn\u2019t suprised it was Gemma who picked up on what I was getting at first.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOh my- Y/N, do you think you might be?\u201d She gasped as her face lit up, and tried to contain the excitement she was clearly feeling.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I said, and ran a hand through my hair as glanced down at my stomach.\u00a0\u201cBut it makes sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve still lost me,\u201d Nick spoke up and also looked to my stomach, his eyes instantly widening as he registered what we\u2019re talking about. A huge smile took over his features, and he clapped his hands together loudly. \u00a0\u201cNo fucking way! My boy might be a dad, and you might be a mum! This is great.\u201d</p><p><i>Three pregnancy tests, and a trip to the doctor later; it was determined that I was indeed pregnant\u2026 And I was completely terrified to tell Harry.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>I went the next couple of days only also sharing the news with Anne; who was overly excited, and made Nick and Gemma vow to keep it a secret until I was ready to tell Harry\u2026 I decided I\u2019d man up and tell him\u00a0after his second show at MSG, but had to figure out how I was going to do so.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>Anne, Gemma, and I arrived in New York City the day before H\u2019s first concert. I got to spend some quality time with him that day, and we even had a nice romantic dinner\u2026 But I still didn\u2019t have the guts to tell him. We were all here for him. The fact that he sold out Madison Square Garden two nights in a row on his first ever solo world tour was huge, and there was no way I was taking that away from him.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>His first night was a complete success, and I was so incredibly proud. He preformed amazingly, and the crowd was loving every moment of it. Before the show, I\u2019d gone through the stadium to the merch stands and decided to buy myself a purple\u00a0\u2018kiwi\u2019 sweater because <b>someone\u00a0</b>never got me one. The people working at the stand greeted me with huge smiles, and tried to prevent me from giving them any money; but I insisted otherwise.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>I also purchased a hair tie set, and just as I was about to pay I saw the button set; and an I idea formed in my mind. One of the buttons said \u2018I\u2019m Having Your Baby,\u2019 and I couldn\u2019t stand the irony of it. That\u2019s how I was going to tell him I was pregnant. Give him the button, walk away, and see how he handles it\u2026 Great plan.</i></p><p><i>The second night was just as amazing as the first, and so the celebrations that took place afterwards started off in full swing with everyone there. It began with the group of us\u00a0playing pool, but escalated pretty\u00a0quickly.</i></p><p><i>\u00a0Later into the night, Harry was well past the point of buzzed; and was full on sloppy drunk. I hadn\u2019t had one sip of alcohol for obvious reasons, and that didn\u2019t go unnoticed by Harry. However, I was able to brush it off as it being because I was still sick; the fact that I\u2019d spent a good twenty minutes next to the toilet that morning was enough for him to go along with that story.</i></p><p><i>I\u2019d separated myself from the group as it became very crowded, and my stomach began to churn. I rushed to the washroom and emptied my stomach once again; hoping the little squish in there would give me some relief from the nausea sooner rather than later.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>I flushed the toilet and went to wash my hands; making a mental note to get some more water to try to get the taste of vomit out of my mouth. I finished rinsing the soap off my hands just as the washroom door swung open, and two pairs of footsteps walked in.</i></p><p>\u201cY/N there you are,\u201d a voice said and I turned to see Sarah and Clare smiling back at me.\u00a0</p><p><i>\u201cHey ladies,\u201d I greeted them with a genuine smile.\u00a0\u201cHaving fun? You\u2019s did amazing tonight by the way.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou\u2019re too kind,\u201d Sarah replied.\u00a0\u201cBut this place is filling up pretty fast with people, I may see if Mitch wants to leave soon before it get\u2019s too crowded.\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ready to call it a night as well,\u201d Clare added. \u201cWe could all just head back to the hotel together.\u201d I nodded in agreement; extremely exhausted from the past few days, and still kind of jet lagged.\u00a0\u201cAdam\u2019s already left to be with the kids\u2026 But speaking of kids\u2026 Is it true Y/N?\u201d</p><p><i>I looked at her oddly before I\u2019d registered what she was asking, and my eyes widened.\u00a0\u201cUhm I uh,\u201d I stuttered and the two of them chuckled.</i></p><p>\u201cShe totally\u2019s got a bun in the oven,\u201d Sarah said, causing my face to redden. She smiles at me gently before glancing at Clare.\u00a0\u201cAnne may have told us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d I muttered.\u00a0\u201cWait, Harry doesn\u2019t know yet does he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo hun, you\u2019re fine,\u201d Clare stated and stepped towards me.\u00a0\u201cJust us, Mitch, Adam, and whoever else you\u2019ve told.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOk good,\u201d I said and patted the button that was in my pocket.\u00a0\u201cI was going to tell him tonight, but it may have to wait until morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnderstandable,\u201d Sarah replied and I smiled.\u00a0\u201cNow I don\u2019t know about you two, but I\u2019m ready to go wander this city a bit and eventually get some sleep.\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cI hear you on that one,\u201d I told her.\u00a0\u201cI think I\u2019ll go collect my boyfriend.\u201d The two girls nodded in understanding, and we all made our way back to where everyone was.</i></p><p>We made small talk as we went, and just as we were about to round the corner; an aggravated voice was raised.\u00a0\u201cHarry, that\u2019s not Y/N!\u201d</p><p><i>I stepped around the corner with Sarah and Clare behind me, and was met by one of the worst sights I\u2019d ever seen in my entire life. No more than five feet away was Mitch desperately trying to pull Harry away from a girl he was full on making out with. My heart plummeted as I watched his right hand tangle into the girls same coloured hair as me, and his left hand grab a handful of the somewhat similar looking dress to what I was wearing; all while who I\u2019m assuming were the girls friends snickered, and took photos from a few more feet away.</i></p><p>\u201cOh my god,\u201d Clare said and a sob escaped my mouth.\u00a0</p><p><i>Hurt, anger, betrayl, sadness, pregnancy hormones\u2026 It was all racing through me as Harry finally let himself be pulled away from the girl, and turned around to give Mitch a glare. I watched as he went to say something, but then his gaze moved back and was met by my tear filled one. His eyes widened as soon as he noticed me, and he instantly moved in my direction; glancing between me and the other girl as if realizing we were two different people.</i></p><p><i>I quickly turned on my heel, and tried to make a b-line for the exit out of there.\u00a0\u201cY/N, wait!\u201d Harry\u2019s voice called after me, but I couldn\u2019t care less as I continued for the door; until a hand wrapped around my wrist and held me back.\u00a0\u201cLet me explain.\u201d</i></p><p><i>I let out a sarcastic laugh as the tears streamed from my eyes, before I whipped around to face him.\u00a0\u201cNo Harry, you don\u2019t get to explain,\u201d I yelled and ripped my arm away from his hold. His features were evident with shock, and even fear as he visibly was sobering up; but was all replaced with desperation as my hand moved to my left ring finger. I slid off the engagement ring he had proposed to me with, and grabbed his hand. I pryed open his fingers from the fist he had them in, before placing the ring on his palm and closing his fingers around it. \u201cI want you to stay away from me.\u201d I told him as my eyes met his tear filled green ones, and\u00a0I reached into my pocket to grab the button.\u00a0\u201cAnd I want you to stay the </i><b><i>hell</i></b><i> away from this baby.\u201d\u00a0</i></p><p><i>I chucked the button at his feet, and turned away from him; not allowing myself to see his reaction as I went out the door and hopped into the nearest cab, driving off and not looking back.</i></p><p><i><b>Emma\u2019s POV *back in present*</b></i></p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s how it all happened,\u201d mum says and concludes her story, as Darcy, Ethan, and I stare at her in awe.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSo it was a drunken mistake,\u201d Ethan states and looks at the ground; trying to wrap his head around the whole thing.\u00a0\u201cDid this girl even look like you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom a distance, yes,\u201d mum tells him with a nod.\u00a0\u201cBut I was pretty caught up in the moment, I didn\u2019t even register that part of it at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone could expect you too, mum,\u201d Darcy speaks up, and I nod my head in agreement.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhen I found out your father made out with this other girl because he thought she was me, I felt like I was crazy for the way I reacted,\u201d she continues to explain.\u00a0\u201cBut I couldn\u2019t help it, it just hurt so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bet no one blamed you for the way you reacted,\u201d I tell her honestly.\u00a0\u201cPlus you were pregnant, that would\u2019ve only made it so much harder to control your emotions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got that right, Squirt,\u201d my dad\u2019s voice speaks up as he walks over to the four of us.\u00a0\u201cIs it alright if I join?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess,\u201d I say dramatically, but shift over a bit so he can sit between mum and I. He winks at me, and nudges my shoulder with his as he sits down. \u201cSo what happened after that? How long were you\u2019s broken up for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a week,\u201d mum tells me with a laugh.\u00a0\u201cKind of pathetic, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKind of pathetic?\u201d dad scoffs and places an arm around her shoulders.\u00a0\u201cYou say that as if it wasn\u2019t one of the hardest weeks of m\u2019life\u2026 I was a disaster.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd so was I,\u201d she continues and looks up at him.\u00a0\u201cI felt like there was this huge hole after I stormed out of that bar. And then I started panicking because I was freaking pregnant\u2026 it was just a mess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat made you guys work it out?\u201d Ethan asks from mum\u2019s other side.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d dad started with a chuckle.\u00a0\u201cFor the first few days, your mum wouldn\u2019t have anything to do with me. I didn\u2019t know what to do. I\u2019d made a very stupid mistake, she broke up with me, <i>and</i> told me that she was pregnant all at once. It all hit me like a brick wall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what made you\u2019s finally talk?\u201d Darcy questions and sits up straight.</p><p>\u201cThat entire week your Aunt\u2019s Gemma, Sarah, and Clare, as well as your Grandma and Uncle Adam tried so hard to get me to hear you dad out. Even your Uncle Jeff took part in that, and I\u2019d even received a call from Grimmy trying to convince me to do the same;\u00a0but I wasn\u2019t having it.\u201d Mum continues to explain.\u00a0\u201cThe week had almost fully gone by, and I was preparing for my flight back to London when I got a call from your Uncle Mitch. Mitch never called me so I knew it was <i>something</i> worth listening too, which is why I answered. I barely got a hello in, before he completely went off about the whole thing. He explained the entire situation, from how your dad\u2019s actions with that girl happened because he thought it was me, to how completely and utterly distraught he was after the whole thing happened. And it gave me a different perspective.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for Mitch doing that, I may have never gotten that call from your mum, and we may have never worked it out,\u201d dad adds in.\u00a0\u201cThe whole thing happened because of my stupidity, and I\u2019m still so happy your mum gave another chance; even thought I didn\u2019t deserve it.\u00a0But words also can\u2019t express how thankful I am that Mitch called her, because otherwise she may have never\u00a0listened. And we may not be where we are now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEth, if Uncle Mitch didn\u2019t do that we may have never been born,\u201d I state in shock as I lean forward to look at my twin.</p><p>Mum and dad both laugh at my statement, but I thought it was valid.\u00a0\u201cI guess you\u2019re right, Em,\u201d mum says.\u00a0\u201cYour\u00a0Uncle Mitch and I became a lot closer after that. I was always close with Sarah, Clare, and Adam; not saying I wasn\u2019t with Mitch, but he\u00a0sometimes is just so quiet, and it can come off as him distancing himself. Nonetheless, after your dad and I worked things out, and the tour had ended; we called the engagement back on, and we began planning our future life as parents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it all turned out pretty well,\u201d Darcy speaks up again from her spot on the gound.\u00a0\u201cBut hey, that\u2019s totally why Aunt Sarah and Uncle Mitch are my godparents isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat it is, Squish,\u201d dad replies, and sends her a wink as he moves to stand up.\u00a0\u201cBut now that you\u2019s know all of this, I vote we go eat some dinner. It\u2019s been a long couple hours, yeah?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt really has,\u201d mum agrees and squeezes his knee. They both stand up and snake each others arm around the other\u2019s waist. I watch as they both look at each other lovingly, and dad leans down to plant a soft kiss on her lips; causing my heart to freaking melt.\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019ll go make something, and call you\u2019s when it\u2019s ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think she means dad will make something, because he doesn\u2019t let her help out of fear she\u2019ll burn the food,\u201d Ethan mutters, and earns himself a scowl from mum as dad laughs. She goes to say something, but dad is quick to distract her and pull her into the house; all while trying to keep himself from laughing harder.\u00a0\u201cSometimes their sappiness is nauseating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes you\u2019re nauseating,\u201d I snap at my twin with a scoff.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cGeez Em,\u201d Dracy spits out between laughs at my statement, and Ethan rolls his eyes.</p><p>I smile down at my big sister, and move my gaze back to the doors where I can see dad playfully trying to whip mum with a dish towel as he chases her around the kitchen, and can\u2019t help but smile.\u00a0\u201cAll I know is that if I don\u2019t have a love like theirs, it\u2019s not even worth it.\u201d</p></p>",

Everything has bloomed, the days are longer, and the weather is just perfect. Ethan and I graduated high school a week ago, and we\u2019ve been soaking up our time off.\u00a0However, today instead of being outside and enjoying it; I\u2019m inside laying on my bed next to trusty pal, Lennon, as I scroll through social media on my phone.\u00a0</p><p>The golden retriever lets out a loud yawn that squeaks at the end, and I can\u2019t help but laugh.\u00a0\u201cTough life, am I right?\u201d I mutter to him in the imaginary voice I\u2019ve created, in which I think Lennon would sound like if he could talk, all while I scratch between his ears.\u00a0\u201cI feel ya.\u201d</p><p>I turn my attention back to my Twitter feed as I mindlessly scroll through it, until a certain article catches my eye. <i>News From Today, Over the Years,</i> it reads and my face instantly lights up. I <i>love</i> this type of thing. There\u2019s literally an article for every day of the year, and it talks about things that made headlines on this day years and years ago if they were really interesting (which they usually are.) I\u2019ve only fell across this account fairly recently, so I wonder what type of things they\u2019ll have to talk about from this fine June 23rd day, over the years.\u00a0</p><p>There\u2019s a lot of things that has happened on this day. The events listed start dated way back to the war of 1812; and go through many historic events such as the initial release of the Nintendo 64 gaming system back in 1996, and lots of others. I continue scrolling into the 2000\u2032s, and a certain event from 2018 almost makes me drop my phone in utter disbelief.</p><p>\u201cHarry Styles cheats on Y/N at post Madison Square Garden concert party in NYC last night, is this the end?\u201d I read out loud and can\u2019t help the feeling as if my jaw just hit the ground. \u201c<i>Pardon?\u201d\u00a0</i></p><p>This article can\u2019t be true, there\u2019s no way. I shake my head in confusion, but hit the link attached to the post to find the original article, and read through it; which leads me to many other news stories similar to the original one. Once I\u2019m finished, I\u2019m at a loss for words. I grip my phone tightly in my hand and roll off my bed to go find the one person I can loose my cool to, and will understand.\u00a0\u201cDarcy!?\u201d</p><p>I stomp down the hallway and the stairs in search of my sister, as I call her name out again.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m outside,\u201d I hear her muffled voice say when I step foot into the kitchen. I make my way to the sliding glass doors that lead to the deck in our backyard, and push them open to find Darcy laying beside the pool; trying to tan. I hate how relaxed she is at a time like this, when I\u2019m basically loosing my mind; and my mood doesn\u2019t go unnoticed by her as I slam the door shut, and let out a huff.\u00a0\u201cWoah, what\u2019s your issue?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDad cheated on mum,\u201d I blurt out and she slowly raises her overly large sunglasses to look at me questionably.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d She says disbelieving and sits up straight.\u00a0\u201cEm, you can\u2019t just go assuming things like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not assuming!\u201d I basically yell, and she holds her hands up in defence.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s with all the yelling?\u201d Ethan asks as he comes around the corner of the house from another part of the backyard, and goes to sit beside Darcy on the lounge chair.</p><p>\u201cEmma thinks dad cheated on mum,\u201d my older sister mutters to my twin.</p><p>\u201cEmma <i>knows</i> dad cheated on mum,\u201d I correct, and shake my head at referring to myself in third person.\u00a0\u201cStop making me think I\u2019m going crazy by saying this!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOk sorry!\u201d Darcy says with a raised voice and I walk towards them.\u00a0\u201cBut what in the <i>hell</i> has got you thinking this way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis,\u201d I tell her and show her the article on my phone.\u00a0</p><p>She hesitantly takes it, and let\u2019s Ethan read the screen from over her shoulder as well.\u00a0\u201cOh my god,\u201d she says and begins typing on the screen.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019re you doing?\u201d I ask and go to grab my phone but she moves it away.</p><p>\u201cM\u2019looking this up,\u201d she replies and presses enter on the Google search bar. She scrolls through a few articles and soon starts looking between Ethan and I.\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re right, Em. There\u2019s so many things on this, and it even seems that they broke up because of it. I\u2019m just confused because this is less than a year before I was born.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t even think of that,\u201d I state with wide eyes and take the phone from her.</p><p>\u201cThis was in June of 2018,\u201d Ethan speaks up and glances away thoughtfully, before slowly bringing his gaze back to my sister and I.\u00a0\u201cDarce was born on January 26th of 2019, which means\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cMum was pregnant with me when this happened,\u201d she whispers as tears fill her eyes. I can\u2019t help the gasp that escapes my mouth as she says this, and Ethan looks completely shell-shocked.</p><p>\u201cWe have to talk to them,\u201d I tell my siblings. They go to respond, but stop when the sounds of car doors closing come from the front of the house; indicating that our parents were home. \u201cAnd I guess now is the time.\u201d</p><p>I turn on my heel and make a b-line for the sliding doors again.\u00a0\u201cEmma wait,\u201d I hear Ethan call after me, but I ignore him. I\u2019m on a mission now.\u00a0Once I\u2019m through the doors, I don\u2019t close them because I know my brother and sister are right behind me; and I also know they won\u2019t be the ones to mention\u00a0the current issue at hand\u2026 This is all on me.</p><p>I storm through the kitchen and into the hallway just as my parents walk through the front door, and Lennon walks up to greet them with his tail wagging. \u00a0They haven\u2019t noticed me yet, but I start growing nervous as the seconds pass by.</p><p>\u201cHey sweetie,\u201d mum says innocently as she notices me, and steps out of her heels. They\u2019re just getting home from a lunch with Uncle Jeff, and seem happy enough; but I\u2019m absolutely about to ruin it.\u00a0\u201cWhy so glum?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad, did you cheat on mum?\u201d I question without hesitation, and complete shock registers on both of their faces.\u00a0</p><p>They glance at each other and back to me slowly.\u00a0\u201cEmma where is this coming from?\u201d Mum asks in disbelief, and crosses her arms defensively; but I ignore her.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d I ask my dad as our matching green eyes hold each others gaze.</p><p>\u201cBub I-,\u201d he starts but I\u2019m quick to cut him off.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t\u00a0<i>\u2018bub\u2019</i> me, dad,\u201d I raise my voice and run a hand through my hair stressfully.\u00a0\u201cJust please answer the question.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cEmma Anne Styles don\u2019t talk to your father like that,\u201d mum snaps and I let out a breathe, not blaming her for being irritated with my sudden outburst.</p><p>\u201cY/N, it\u2019s ok. She\u2019s upset,\u201d dad says gently and places a hand on her arm. His gaze slowly moves back to mine, and he glances behind before sighing in defeat.\u00a0\u201cYes, I did. A long time ago, and it was the biggest mistake of my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad how could you?\u201d Darcy says from behind me, and I turn around to see her standing in the kitchen doorway next to Ethan with tears in her eyes.\u00a0\u201cMum was <i>pregnant</i>.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s really messed up,\u201d Ethan tells him, and shakes his head.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSquish, Slick, if you\u2019d jus let me explain,\u201d dad pleads but it\u2019s really no use. The three of us have heard enough. He looks at me one last time, and I glance between him and mum; both of their eyes beginning to water.\u00a0\u201cSquirt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019d do that to mum,\u201d I whispe,r and look away.\u00a0\u201cShe deserves so much better than that. I-I thought you\u2019s were soulmates.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cEmma just listen, please,\u201d mum begs.</p><p>\u201cI will listen to you mum,\u201d I tell her with a sad smile.\u00a0\u201cBut I really don\u2019t know what to say right now. I need to just let this sink in.\u201d I turn to face at my siblings, and they look at me sadly. I walk towards them and the three of us make our way back through the kitchen, to go outside again and away from our parents.\u00a0</p><p>I\u2019m the last to walk through the door, and just as I\u2019m about to be outside I can hear a soft voice.\u00a0\u201cWhat\u2019re we gonna do, Haz?\u201d Mum says as I slide the door shut, and go sit down.</p><p>About two hours pass, and it\u2019s been awful. Drace, Ethan, and I have all just sat here in silence; which has really just made me think the worse of my dad\u2026 and I hate it. My dad is my best friend, and I love him to death. I know how much he loves mum; I\u2019ve never had to question that before, but now I\u2019m confused. Confused by why or how he could do such a thing, and also what made mum forgive him.\u00a0</p><p>As if reading my mind, the glass doors slide open and mum pokes her head out of kitchen.\u00a0\u201cHey babes,\u201d she says quietly and looks around at the three of us.\u00a0\u201cCan we talk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course mum,\u201d Ethan says from his spot beside me on the chair swing, and shifts so mum can sit between us. Darcy grabs two of the cushions from another chair, and lays them down on the deck to sit on; so she can be close to us.</p><p>I watch as mum gets comfy and she takes one last look at the three of us, before taking a breath.\u00a0\u201cOk. So what would you\u2019s like to know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything,\u201d we all say in unison, and narrow our eyes at each other.</p><p>\u201cWe just want to understand what happened, mum,\u201d Darcy speaks up.\u00a0\u201cThis is all really confusing and unexpected.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand,\u201d mum replies with a sigh.\u00a0\u201cAnd I\u2019ll tell you. See, it all started back at the beginning of May in 2018\u2026\u201d</p><p><i><b>Y/N\u2019s POV *flashback*</b></i></p><p><i>I was insanely excited. But with the way by right knee nervously bounced up and down, as the plane landed in Hong Kong; you could rightfully think otherwise</i>. </p><p><i>It\u2019d been a long two and a half weeks since the European leg of Harry\u2019s tour came to a close, and I was left in London to work as he parted for Australia\u2026 Saying I missed him was an understatement, and I knew he felt the same. </i></p><p><i>Sure, two and a half weeks apart isn\u2019t the longest we\u2019ve gone without seeing each other; but that\u2019s beside the point. When I managed to get two weeks off work at the beginning of May, I was quick booking a flight to join Harry on tour again for his shows in Hong Kong, Bangkok, Osaka, and Tokyo; before spending another few days with him back home in London, prior to his departure for the South American leg of his tour. </i></p><p><i>When the plane came to a full stop, I was one of the first people off of it; not wanting to wait any longer to see my man. I maneuvered through the crowds of people in the busy airport, and retrieved my luggage before looking for the man occupying my thoughts. </i></p><p><i>I stood on my tiptoes in attempts to see him through the crowd, but it was useless as people just passed by and gave me dirty looks for stopping; and the odd one taking a picture once they realized who this random person was. </i></p><p><i>A sigh escaped my mouth as the want to get out of there grew, so I reached into my pocket to pull out my phone and call Harry; but jumped when a voice spoke up from behind me. </i></p><p><i>\u201cThere\u2019s my fianc\u00e9,\u201d it said and I couldn\u2019t help the huge grin on my face as I turned around and saw my favourite person. I squealed and ran into his embrace as fast as I possibly could; instantly feeling better by having him around again. \u201cMissed you, petal.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cMissed you more, H,\u201d I told him and ruffled my hand through his curls; that were starting to grow out again, may I add.\u00a0</i></p><p>\u201cS\u2019impossible,\u201d he replied and pulled me closer so our lips could meet. I was out of breath by the time he pulled away, and I could\u2019ve smacked the smug look he had on his face when looked down at me.\u00a0\u201cLet\u2019s get out of here, yeah? Before more people notice us.\u201d</p><p><i>His gaze moved to behind me, and I turned around to see a small group of people had formed and were taking pictures of us.\u00a0\u201cOk deal,\u201d I said and grabbed ahold of his hand so we could head to the hotel after he\u2019d taken a few pictures with fans.</i></p><p><i>That night in Hong Kong was\u2026 intimate, to say the least. So was that whole two weeks we\u2019d spent together really, but it wasn\u2019t anything new. Our time together was amazing, but it went by quickly\u2026 And soon he was leaving again, but this time it was going to be a month before I saw him again.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>I invested myself deeply into work, and even started writing again for the first time in a long time during that month. Luckily it went by seemingly fast, and it was soon less than a week before I was to fly to New York City with Anne and Gemma for Harry\u2019s shows at MSG\u2026 but I wasn\u2019t doing too good.</i></p><p><i>\u201cHello,\u201d I groaned into my cell phone without looking to see who it was calling me.</i></p><p><i>\u201cY/N?\u201d Harry\u2019s voice sounded through the device, and I fliched at the sudden noise.\u00a0\u201cAre you alright? Gemma said you were sick.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cM\u2019fine,\u201d I lied, and glanced at my surroundings. I was sitting on the cold tile floor in Harry\u2019s and I\u2019s bathroom in our shared flat, leaning against the vanity after I\u2019d just spent a solid five minutes hunched over the toilet emptying the contents of my stomach. I groaned internally as I wiped some sweat that had collected on my forehead away, and pulled myself into a standing position so I could brush my teeth.\u00a0\u201cNever better.\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a terrible liar, bub,\u201d he said with a sigh.\u00a0\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know actually,\u201d I told him honestly.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ve just woken up and gotten sick every morning for the past few days now, and it\u2019s getting real old. Must\u2019ve caught a bug or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should go to the doctor,\u201d he replied matter of factly and I rolled my eyes.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019ll be fine,\u201d I retorted.\u00a0\u201cBut just for you, I\u2019ll try to make an appointment for tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Gotta have you feeling better for your flight over here,\u201d he said, and I could practically hear the smile I imagined on his face.\u00a0\u201cI miss you, petal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI miss you too,\u201d I explained with a sad smile.\u00a0\u201cSo much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly a few more days,\u201d he stated in attempt to make us both feel better, and my heart fluttered.\u00a0\u201cBut wait, aren\u2019t you supposed to be going out with Gemma today?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d I confirmed as I put the phone on speaker, and spit the toothpaste out of my mouth. I rinsed off the toothbrush, and grabbed my hairbrush to work on that mess.\u00a0\u201cIn like half an hour and then meeting up with Nick afterwards, so I should probably get going, H. And you should get to sleep. It\u2019s after two o\u2019clock in the morning there, and you have a show in Toronto tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, I know,\u201d he groaned, and I rolled my eyes again.\u00a0\u201cWas just worried about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I smiled at his cheesiness.\u00a0\u201cAnd I promise you I\u2019m fine, really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever you say,\u201d he replied disbelievingly.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cCan it, Styles,\u201d I scoffed and he chuckled.\u00a0\u201cBut I really should go. I love you, and will talk to you later, ok?\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cSounds good,\u201d he said, and audibly let out a yawn.\u00a0\u201cAnd I love you.\u201d We said our goodbyes, and I hung up the phone so I could get ready for breakfast with Gemma.</i></p><p><i>After we ate; we met up with Grimmy once his breakfast show was done for the day, and did some shopping. We ended up in a supermarket to pick some things up for Gem, before we were to part; and I was to head home and pack.</i></p><p><i>In the supermarket; I ventured off to grab some snacks I\u2019d been craving before going to look for Nick and Gemma again. I found them in the aisle where the feminine hygeine products were, just as Gem was placing a box of tampons into her basket.</i></p><p>\u201cYou women have it so hard,\u201d Nick stated sympathetically as they turned to look at me, and that\u2019s when it clicked.</p><p>\u201cHoly shit,\u201d I said aloud, and dropped the box of cookies I was holding. Panic started to take over my body, and I began hyperventilating as I looked at the two of them with wide eyes.\u00a0\u201cOh my god\u2026 Oh my GOD.\u201d</p><p>\u201cY/N, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d Gemma asked; concern written well across her features.\u00a0\u201cAre you not feeling well again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m late,\u201d I whispered as tears began pricking my eyes.\u00a0\u201cOh my god, I\u2019m so late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLate?\u201d Gemma questioned, still clearly confused.\u00a0\u201cLate to where?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo not late somewhere\u2026 <b>I\u2019m</b> late,\u201d I tried to explain between shaky breathes.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to have to elaborate, love,\u201d Nick said as I put a hand on my chest in attempt to steady my breathing, and calm the hell down.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cMy <b>period</b> is late,\u201d I blurted out and their eyes widened. These were the two who knew first hand just how sick I\u2019d been recently, and I wasn\u2019t suprised it was Gemma who picked up on what I was getting at first.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOh my- Y/N, do you think you might be?\u201d She gasped as her face lit up, and tried to contain the excitement she was clearly feeling.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I said, and ran a hand through my hair as glanced down at my stomach.\u00a0\u201cBut it makes sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve still lost me,\u201d Nick spoke up and also looked to my stomach, his eyes instantly widening as he registered what we\u2019re talking about. A huge smile took over his features, and he clapped his hands together loudly. \u00a0\u201cNo fucking way! My boy might be a dad, and you might be a mum! This is great.\u201d</p><p><i>Three pregnancy tests, and a trip to the doctor later; it was determined that I was indeed pregnant\u2026 And I was completely terrified to tell Harry.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>I went the next couple of days only also sharing the news with Anne; who was overly excited, and made Nick and Gemma vow to keep it a secret until I was ready to tell Harry\u2026 I decided I\u2019d man up and tell him\u00a0after his second show at MSG, but had to figure out how I was going to do so.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>Anne, Gemma, and I arrived in New York City the day before H\u2019s first concert. I got to spend some quality time with him that day, and we even had a nice romantic dinner\u2026 But I still didn\u2019t have the guts to tell him. We were all here for him. The fact that he sold out Madison Square Garden two nights in a row on his first ever solo world tour was huge, and there was no way I was taking that away from him.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>His first night was a complete success, and I was so incredibly proud. He preformed amazingly, and the crowd was loving every moment of it. Before the show, I\u2019d gone through the stadium to the merch stands and decided to buy myself a purple\u00a0\u2018kiwi\u2019 sweater because <b>someone\u00a0</b>never got me one. The people working at the stand greeted me with huge smiles, and tried to prevent me from giving them any money; but I insisted otherwise.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>I also purchased a hair tie set, and just as I was about to pay I saw the button set; and an I idea formed in my mind. One of the buttons said \u2018I\u2019m Having Your Baby,\u2019 and I couldn\u2019t stand the irony of it. That\u2019s how I was going to tell him I was pregnant. Give him the button, walk away, and see how he handles it\u2026 Great plan.</i></p><p><i>The second night was just as amazing as the first, and so the celebrations that took place afterwards started off in full swing with everyone there. It began with the group of us\u00a0playing pool, but escalated pretty\u00a0quickly.</i></p><p><i>\u00a0Later into the night, Harry was well past the point of buzzed; and was full on sloppy drunk. I hadn\u2019t had one sip of alcohol for obvious reasons, and that didn\u2019t go unnoticed by Harry. However, I was able to brush it off as it being because I was still sick; the fact that I\u2019d spent a good twenty minutes next to the toilet that morning was enough for him to go along with that story.</i></p><p><i>I\u2019d separated myself from the group as it became very crowded, and my stomach began to churn. I rushed to the washroom and emptied my stomach once again; hoping the little squish in there would give me some relief from the nausea sooner rather than later.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>I flushed the toilet and went to wash my hands; making a mental note to get some more water to try to get the taste of vomit out of my mouth. I finished rinsing the soap off my hands just as the washroom door swung open, and two pairs of footsteps walked in.</i></p><p>\u201cY/N there you are,\u201d a voice said and I turned to see Sarah and Clare smiling back at me.\u00a0</p><p><i>\u201cHey ladies,\u201d I greeted them with a genuine smile.\u00a0\u201cHaving fun? You\u2019s did amazing tonight by the way.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou\u2019re too kind,\u201d Sarah replied.\u00a0\u201cBut this place is filling up pretty fast with people, I may see if Mitch wants to leave soon before it get\u2019s too crowded.\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ready to call it a night as well,\u201d Clare added. \u201cWe could all just head back to the hotel together.\u201d I nodded in agreement; extremely exhausted from the past few days, and still kind of jet lagged.\u00a0\u201cAdam\u2019s already left to be with the kids\u2026 But speaking of kids\u2026 Is it true Y/N?\u201d</p><p><i>I looked at her oddly before I\u2019d registered what she was asking, and my eyes widened.\u00a0\u201cUhm I uh,\u201d I stuttered and the two of them chuckled.</i></p><p>\u201cShe totally\u2019s got a bun in the oven,\u201d Sarah said, causing my face to redden. She smiles at me gently before glancing at Clare.\u00a0\u201cAnne may have told us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d I muttered.\u00a0\u201cWait, Harry doesn\u2019t know yet does he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo hun, you\u2019re fine,\u201d Clare stated and stepped towards me.\u00a0\u201cJust us, Mitch, Adam, and whoever else you\u2019ve told.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOk good,\u201d I said and patted the button that was in my pocket.\u00a0\u201cI was going to tell him tonight, but it may have to wait until morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnderstandable,\u201d Sarah replied and I smiled.\u00a0\u201cNow I don\u2019t know about you two, but I\u2019m ready to go wander this city a bit and eventually get some sleep.\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cI hear you on that one,\u201d I told her.\u00a0\u201cI think I\u2019ll go collect my boyfriend.\u201d The two girls nodded in understanding, and we all made our way back to where everyone was.</i></p><p>We made small talk as we went, and just as we were about to round the corner; an aggravated voice was raised.\u00a0\u201cHarry, that\u2019s not Y/N!\u201d</p><p><i>I stepped around the corner with Sarah and Clare behind me, and was met by one of the worst sights I\u2019d ever seen in my entire life. No more than five feet away was Mitch desperately trying to pull Harry away from a girl he was full on making out with. My heart plummeted as I watched his right hand tangle into the girls same coloured hair as me, and his left hand grab a handful of the somewhat similar looking dress to what I was wearing; all while who I\u2019m assuming were the girls friends snickered, and took photos from a few more feet away.</i></p><p>\u201cOh my god,\u201d Clare said and a sob escaped my mouth.\u00a0</p><p><i>Hurt, anger, betrayl, sadness, pregnancy hormones\u2026 It was all racing through me as Harry finally let himself be pulled away from the girl, and turned around to give Mitch a glare. I watched as he went to say something, but then his gaze moved back and was met by my tear filled one. His eyes widened as soon as he noticed me, and he instantly moved in my direction; glancing between me and the other girl as if realizing we were two different people.</i></p><p><i>I quickly turned on my heel, and tried to make a b-line for the exit out of there.\u00a0\u201cY/N, wait!\u201d Harry\u2019s voice called after me, but I couldn\u2019t care less as I continued for the door; until a hand wrapped around my wrist and held me back.\u00a0\u201cLet me explain.\u201d</i></p><p><i>I let out a sarcastic laugh as the tears streamed from my eyes, before I whipped around to face him.\u00a0\u201cNo Harry, you don\u2019t get to explain,\u201d I yelled and ripped my arm away from his hold. His features were evident with shock, and even fear as he visibly was sobering up; but was all replaced with desperation as my hand moved to my left ring finger. I slid off the engagement ring he had proposed to me with, and grabbed his hand. I pryed open his fingers from the fist he had them in, before placing the ring on his palm and closing his fingers around it. \u201cI want you to stay away from me.\u201d I told him as my eyes met his tear filled green ones, and\u00a0I reached into my pocket to grab the button.\u00a0\u201cAnd I want you to stay the </i><b><i>hell</i></b><i> away from this baby.\u201d\u00a0</i></p><p><i>I chucked the button at his feet, and turned away from him; not allowing myself to see his reaction as I went out the door and hopped into the nearest cab, driving off and not looking back.</i></p><p><i><b>Emma\u2019s POV *back in present*</b></i></p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s how it all happened,\u201d mum says and concludes her story, as Darcy, Ethan, and I stare at her in awe.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSo it was a drunken mistake,\u201d Ethan states and looks at the ground; trying to wrap his head around the whole thing.\u00a0\u201cDid this girl even look like you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom a distance, yes,\u201d mum tells him with a nod.\u00a0\u201cBut I was pretty caught up in the moment, I didn\u2019t even register that part of it at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone could expect you too, mum,\u201d Darcy speaks up, and I nod my head in agreement.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhen I found out your father made out with this other girl because he thought she was me, I felt like I was crazy for the way I reacted,\u201d she continues to explain.\u00a0\u201cBut I couldn\u2019t help it, it just hurt so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bet no one blamed you for the way you reacted,\u201d I tell her honestly.\u00a0\u201cPlus you were pregnant, that would\u2019ve only made it so much harder to control your emotions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got that right, Squirt,\u201d my dad\u2019s voice speaks up as he walks over to the four of us.\u00a0\u201cIs it alright if I join?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess,\u201d I say dramatically, but shift over a bit so he can sit between mum and I.

It all hit me like a brick wall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what made you\u2019s finally talk?\u201d Darcy questions and sits up straight.</p><p>\u201cThat entire week your Aunt\u2019s Gemma, Sarah, and Clare, as well as your Grandma and Uncle Adam tried so hard to get me to hear you dad out. Even your Uncle Jeff took part in that, and I\u2019d even received a call from Grimmy trying to convince me to do the same;\u00a0but I wasn\u2019t having it.\u201d Mum continues to explain.\u00a0\u201cThe week had almost fully gone by, and I was preparing for my flight back to London when I got a call from your Uncle Mitch. Mitch never called me so I knew it was <i>something</i> worth listening too, which is why I answered. I barely got a hello in, before he completely went off about the whole thing. He explained the entire situation, from how your dad\u2019s actions with that girl happened because he thought it was me, to how completely and utterly distraught he was after the whole thing happened. And it gave me a different perspective.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for Mitch doing that, I may have never gotten that call from your mum, and we may have never worked it out,\u201d dad adds in.\u00a0\u201cThe whole thing happened because of my stupidity, and I\u2019m still so happy your mum gave another chance; even thought I didn\u2019t deserve it.\u00a0But words also can\u2019t express how thankful I am that Mitch called her, because otherwise she may have never\u00a0listened. And we may not be where we are now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEth, if Uncle Mitch didn\u2019t do that we may have never been born,\u201d I state in shock as I lean forward to look at my twin.</p><p>Mum and dad both laugh at my statement, but I thought it was valid.\u00a0\u201cI guess you\u2019re right, Em,\u201d mum says.\u00a0\u201cYour\u00a0Uncle Mitch and I became a lot closer after that. I was always close with Sarah, Clare, and Adam; not saying I wasn\u2019t with Mitch, but he\u00a0sometimes is just so quiet, and it can come off as him distancing himself. Nonetheless, after your dad and I worked things out, and the tour had ended; we called the engagement back on, and we began planning our future life as parents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it all turned out pretty well,\u201d Darcy speaks up again from her spot on the gound.\u00a0\u201cBut hey, that\u2019s totally why Aunt Sarah and Uncle Mitch are my godparents isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat it is, Squish,\u201d dad replies, and sends her a wink as he moves to stand up.\u00a0\u201cBut now that you\u2019s know all of this, I vote we go eat some dinner. It\u2019s been a long couple hours, yeah?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt really has,\u201d mum agrees and squeezes his knee. They both stand up and snake each others arm around the other\u2019s waist. I watch as they both look at each other lovingly, and dad leans down to plant a soft kiss on her lips; causing my heart to freaking melt.\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019ll go make something, and call you\u2019s when it\u2019s ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think she means dad will make something, because he doesn\u2019t let her help out of fear she\u2019ll burn the food,\u201d Ethan mutters, and earns himself a scowl from mum as dad laughs. She goes to say something, but dad is quick to distract her and pull her into the house; all while trying to keep himself from laughing harder.\u00a0\u201cSometimes their sappiness is nauseating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes you\u2019re nauseating,\u201d I snap at my twin with a scoff.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cGeez Em,\u201d Dracy spits out between laughs at my statement, and Ethan rolls his eyes.</p><p>I smile down at my big sister, and move my gaze back to the doors where I can see dad playfully trying to whip mum with a dish towel as he chases her around the kitchen, and can\u2019t help but smile.\u00a0\u201cAll I know is that if I don\u2019t have a love like theirs, it\u2019s not even worth it.\u201d</p></p>",

Everything has bloomed, the days are longer, and the weather is just perfect. Ethan and I graduated high school a week ago, and we&rsquo;ve been soaking up our time off.&nbsp;However, today instead of being outside and enjoying it; I&rsquo;m inside laying on my bed next to trusty pal, Lennon, as I scroll through social media on my phone.&nbsp;</p><p>The golden retriever lets out a loud yawn that squeaks at the end, and I can&rsquo;t help but laugh.&nbsp;&ldquo;Tough life, am I right?&rdquo; I mutter to him in the imaginary voice I&rsquo;ve created, in which I think Lennon would sound like if he could talk, all while I scratch between his ears.&nbsp;&ldquo;I feel ya.&rdquo;</p><p>I turn my attention back to my Twitter feed as I mindlessly scroll through it, until a certain article catches my eye. <i>News From Today, Over the Years,</i> it reads and my face instantly lights up. I <i>love</i> this type of thing. There&rsquo;s literally an article for every day of the year, and it talks about things that made headlines on this day years and years ago if they were really interesting (which they usually are.) I&rsquo;ve only fell across this account fairly recently, so I wonder what type of things they&rsquo;ll have to talk about from this fine June 23rd day, over the years.&nbsp;</p><p>There&rsquo;s a lot of things that has happened on this day. The events listed start dated way back to the war of 1812; and go through many historic events such as the initial release of the Nintendo 64 gaming system back in 1996, and lots of others. I continue scrolling into the 2000&prime;s, and a certain event from 2018 almost makes me drop my phone in utter disbelief.</p><p>&ldquo;Harry Styles cheats on Y/N at post Madison Square Garden concert party in NYC last night, is this the end?&rdquo; I read out loud and can&rsquo;t help the feeling as if my jaw just hit the ground. &ldquo;<i>Pardon?&rdquo;&nbsp;</i></p><p>This article can&rsquo;t be true, there&rsquo;s no way. I shake my head in confusion, but hit the link attached to the post to find the original article, and read through it; which leads me to many other news stories similar to the original one. Once I&rsquo;m finished, I&rsquo;m at a loss for words. I grip my phone tightly in my hand and roll off my bed to go find the one person I can loose my cool to, and will understand.&nbsp;&ldquo;Darcy!?&rdquo;</p><p>I stomp down the hallway and the stairs in search of my sister, as I call her name out again.&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m outside,&rdquo; I hear her muffled voice say when I step foot into the kitchen. I make my way to the sliding glass doors that lead to the deck in our backyard, and push them open to find Darcy laying beside the pool; trying to tan. I hate how relaxed she is at a time like this, when I&rsquo;m basically loosing my mind; and my mood doesn&rsquo;t go unnoticed by her as I slam the door shut, and let out a huff.&nbsp;&ldquo;Woah, what&rsquo;s your issue?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Dad cheated on mum,&rdquo; I blurt out and she slowly raises her overly large sunglasses to look at me questionably.</p><p>&ldquo;Excuse me?&rdquo; She says disbelieving and sits up straight.&nbsp;&ldquo;Em, you can&rsquo;t just go assuming things like that.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not assuming!&rdquo; I basically yell, and she holds her hands up in defence.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s with all the yelling?&rdquo; Ethan asks as he comes around the corner of the house from another part of the backyard, and goes to sit beside Darcy on the lounge chair.</p><p>&ldquo;Emma thinks dad cheated on mum,&rdquo; my older sister mutters to my twin.</p><p>&ldquo;Emma <i>knows</i> dad cheated on mum,&rdquo; I correct, and shake my head at referring to myself in third person.&nbsp;&ldquo;Stop making me think I&rsquo;m going crazy by saying this!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ok sorry!&rdquo; Darcy says with a raised voice and I walk towards them.&nbsp;&ldquo;But what in the <i>hell</i> has got you thinking this way?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; I tell her and show her the article on my phone.&nbsp;</p><p>She hesitantly takes it, and let&rsquo;s Ethan read the screen from over her shoulder as well.&nbsp;&ldquo;Oh my god,&rdquo; she says and begins typing on the screen.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;re you doing?&rdquo; I ask and go to grab my phone but she moves it away.</p><p>&ldquo;M&rsquo;looking this up,&rdquo; she replies and presses enter on the Google search bar. She scrolls through a few articles and soon starts looking between Ethan and I.&nbsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, Em. There&rsquo;s so many things on this, and it even seems that they broke up because of it. I&rsquo;m just confused because this is less than a year before I was born.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t even think of that,&rdquo; I state with wide eyes and take the phone from her.</p><p>&ldquo;This was in June of 2018,&rdquo; Ethan speaks up and glances away thoughtfully, before slowly bringing his gaze back to my sister and I.&nbsp;&ldquo;Darce was born on January 26th of 2019, which means&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Mum was pregnant with me when this happened,&rdquo; she whispers as tears fill her eyes. I can&rsquo;t help the gasp that escapes my mouth as she says this, and Ethan looks completely shell-shocked.</p><p>&ldquo;We have to talk to them,&rdquo; I tell my siblings. They go to respond, but stop when the sounds of car doors closing come from the front of the house; indicating that our parents were home. &ldquo;And I guess now is the time.&rdquo;</p><p>I turn on my heel and make a b-line for the sliding doors again.&nbsp;&ldquo;Emma wait,&rdquo; I hear Ethan call after me, but I ignore him. I&rsquo;m on a mission now.&nbsp;Once I&rsquo;m through the doors, I don&rsquo;t close them because I know my brother and sister are right behind me; and I also know they won&rsquo;t be the ones to mention&nbsp;the current issue at hand&hellip; This is all on me.</p><p>I storm through the kitchen and into the hallway just as my parents walk through the front door, and Lennon walks up to greet them with his tail wagging. &nbsp;They haven&rsquo;t noticed me yet, but I start growing nervous as the seconds pass by.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey sweetie,&rdquo; mum says innocently as she notices me, and steps out of her heels. They&rsquo;re just getting home from a lunch with Uncle Jeff, and seem happy enough; but I&rsquo;m absolutely about to ruin it.&nbsp;&ldquo;Why so glum?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Dad, did you cheat on mum?&rdquo; I question without hesitation, and complete shock registers on both of their faces.&nbsp;</p><p>They glance at each other and back to me slowly.&nbsp;&ldquo;Emma where is this coming from?&rdquo; Mum asks in disbelief, and crosses her arms defensively; but I ignore her.</p><p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; I ask my dad as our matching green eyes hold each others gaze.</p><p>&ldquo;Bub I-,&rdquo; he starts but I&rsquo;m quick to cut him off.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t&nbsp;<i>&lsquo;bub&rsquo;</i> me, dad,&rdquo; I raise my voice and run a hand through my hair stressfully.&nbsp;&ldquo;Just please answer the question.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Emma Anne Styles don&rsquo;t talk to your father like that,&rdquo; mum snaps and I let out a breathe, not blaming her for being irritated with my sudden outburst.</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N, it&rsquo;s ok. She&rsquo;s upset,&rdquo; dad says gently and places a hand on her arm. His gaze slowly moves back to mine, and he glances behind before sighing in defeat.&nbsp;&ldquo;Yes, I did. A long time ago, and it was the biggest mistake of my life.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Dad how could you?&rdquo; Darcy says from behind me, and I turn around to see her standing in the kitchen doorway next to Ethan with tears in her eyes.&nbsp;&ldquo;Mum was <i>pregnant</i>.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s really messed up,&rdquo; Ethan tells him, and shakes his head.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Squish, Slick, if you&rsquo;d jus let me explain,&rdquo; dad pleads but it&rsquo;s really no use. The three of us have heard enough. He looks at me one last time, and I glance between him and mum; both of their eyes beginning to water.&nbsp;&ldquo;Squirt?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe you&rsquo;d do that to mum,&rdquo; I whispe,r and look away.&nbsp;&ldquo;She deserves so much better than that. I-I thought you&rsquo;s were soulmates.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Emma just listen, please,&rdquo; mum begs.</p><p>&ldquo;I will listen to you mum,&rdquo; I tell her with a sad smile.&nbsp;&ldquo;But I really don&rsquo;t know what to say right now. I need to just let this sink in.&rdquo; I turn to face at my siblings, and they look at me sadly. I walk towards them and the three of us make our way back through the kitchen, to go outside again and away from our parents.&nbsp;</p><p>I&rsquo;m the last to walk through the door, and just as I&rsquo;m about to be outside I can hear a soft voice.&nbsp;&ldquo;What&rsquo;re we gonna do, Haz?&rdquo; Mum says as I slide the door shut, and go sit down.</p><p>About two hours pass, and it&rsquo;s been awful. Drace, Ethan, and I have all just sat here in silence; which has really just made me think the worse of my dad&hellip; and I hate it. My dad is my best friend, and I love him to death. I know how much he loves mum; I&rsquo;ve never had to question that before, but now I&rsquo;m confused. Confused by why or how he could do such a thing, and also what made mum forgive him.&nbsp;</p><p>As if reading my mind, the glass doors slide open and mum pokes her head out of kitchen.&nbsp;&ldquo;Hey babes,&rdquo; she says quietly and looks around at the three of us.&nbsp;&ldquo;Can we talk?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Of course mum,&rdquo; Ethan says from his spot beside me on the chair swing, and shifts so mum can sit between us. Darcy grabs two of the cushions from another chair, and lays them down on the deck to sit on; so she can be close to us.</p><p>I watch as mum gets comfy and she takes one last look at the three of us, before taking a breath.&nbsp;&ldquo;Ok. So what would you&rsquo;s like to know?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Everything,&rdquo; we all say in unison, and narrow our eyes at each other.</p><p>&ldquo;We just want to understand what happened, mum,&rdquo; Darcy speaks up.&nbsp;&ldquo;This is all really confusing and unexpected.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; mum replies with a sigh.&nbsp;&ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll tell you. See, it all started back at the beginning of May in 2018&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p><i><b>Y/N&rsquo;s POV *flashback*</b></i></p><p><i>I was insanely excited. But with the way by right knee nervously bounced up and down, as the plane landed in Hong Kong; you could rightfully think otherwise</i>. </p><p><i>It&rsquo;d been a long two and a half weeks since the European leg of Harry&rsquo;s tour came to a close, and I was left in London to work as he parted for Australia&hellip; Saying I missed him was an understatement, and I knew he felt the same. </i></p><p><i>Sure, two and a half weeks apart isn&rsquo;t the longest we&rsquo;ve gone without seeing each other; but that&rsquo;s beside the point. When I managed to get two weeks off work at the beginning of May, I was quick booking a flight to join Harry on tour again for his shows in Hong Kong, Bangkok, Osaka, and Tokyo; before spending another few days with him back home in London, prior to his departure for the South American leg of his tour. </i></p><p><i>When the plane came to a full stop, I was one of the first people off of it; not wanting to wait any longer to see my man. I maneuvered through the crowds of people in the busy airport, and retrieved my luggage before looking for the man occupying my thoughts. </i></p><p><i>I stood on my tiptoes in attempts to see him through the crowd, but it was useless as people just passed by and gave me dirty looks for stopping; and the odd one taking a picture once they realized who this random person was. </i></p><p><i>A sigh escaped my mouth as the want to get out of there grew, so I reached into my pocket to pull out my phone and call Harry; but jumped when a voice spoke up from behind me. </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s my fianc&eacute;,&rdquo; it said and I couldn&rsquo;t help the huge grin on my face as I turned around and saw my favourite person. I squealed and ran into his embrace as fast as I possibly could; instantly feeling better by having him around again. &ldquo;Missed you, petal.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Missed you more, H,&rdquo; I told him and ruffled my hand through his curls; that were starting to grow out again, may I add.&nbsp;</i></p><p>&ldquo;S&rsquo;impossible,&rdquo; he replied and pulled me closer so our lips could meet. I was out of breath by the time he pulled away, and I could&rsquo;ve smacked the smug look he had on his face when looked down at me.&nbsp;&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get out of here, yeah? Before more people notice us.&rdquo;</p><p><i>His gaze moved to behind me, and I turned around to see a small group of people had formed and were taking pictures of us.&nbsp;&ldquo;Ok deal,&rdquo; I said and grabbed ahold of his hand so we could head to the hotel after he&rsquo;d taken a few pictures with fans.</i></p><p><i>That night in Hong Kong was&hellip; intimate, to say the least. So was that whole two weeks we&rsquo;d spent together really, but it wasn&rsquo;t anything new. Our time together was amazing, but it went by quickly&hellip; And soon he was leaving again, but this time it was going to be a month before I saw him again.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>I invested myself deeply into work, and even started writing again for the first time in a long time during that month. Luckily it went by seemingly fast, and it was soon less than a week before I was to fly to New York City with Anne and Gemma for Harry&rsquo;s shows at MSG&hellip; but I wasn&rsquo;t doing too good.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Hello,&rdquo; I groaned into my cell phone without looking to see who it was calling me.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Y/N?&rdquo; Harry&rsquo;s voice sounded through the device, and I fliched at the sudden noise.&nbsp;&ldquo;Are you alright? Gemma said you were sick.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;M&rsquo;fine,&rdquo; I lied, and glanced at my surroundings. I was sitting on the cold tile floor in Harry&rsquo;s and I&rsquo;s bathroom in our shared flat, leaning against the vanity after I&rsquo;d just spent a solid five minutes hunched over the toilet emptying the contents of my stomach. I groaned internally as I wiped some sweat that had collected on my forehead away, and pulled myself into a standing position so I could brush my teeth.&nbsp;&ldquo;Never better.&rdquo;</i></p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a terrible liar, bub,&rdquo; he said with a sigh.&nbsp;&ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know actually,&rdquo; I told him honestly.&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just woken up and gotten sick every morning for the past few days now, and it&rsquo;s getting real old. Must&rsquo;ve caught a bug or something.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Maybe you should go to the doctor,&rdquo; he replied matter of factly and I rolled my eyes.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll be fine,&rdquo; I retorted.&nbsp;&ldquo;But just for you, I&rsquo;ll try to make an appointment for tomorrow.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Good. Gotta have you feeling better for your flight over here,&rdquo; he said, and I could practically hear the smile I imagined on his face.&nbsp;&ldquo;I miss you, petal.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I miss you too,&rdquo; I explained with a sad smile.&nbsp;&ldquo;So much.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Only a few more days,&rdquo; he stated in attempt to make us both feel better, and my heart fluttered.&nbsp;&ldquo;But wait, aren&rsquo;t you supposed to be going out with Gemma today?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I am,&rdquo; I confirmed as I put the phone on speaker, and spit the toothpaste out of my mouth. I rinsed off the toothbrush, and grabbed my hairbrush to work on that mess.&nbsp;&ldquo;In like half an hour and then meeting up with Nick afterwards, so I should probably get going, H. And you should get to sleep. It&rsquo;s after two o&rsquo;clock in the morning there, and you have a show in Toronto tonight.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know, I know,&rdquo; he groaned, and I rolled my eyes again.&nbsp;&ldquo;Was just worried about you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; I smiled at his cheesiness.&nbsp;&ldquo;And I promise you I&rsquo;m fine, really.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Whatever you say,&rdquo; he replied disbelievingly.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Can it, Styles,&rdquo; I scoffed and he chuckled.&nbsp;&ldquo;But I really should go. I love you, and will talk to you later, ok?&rdquo;</p><p><i>&ldquo;Sounds good,&rdquo; he said, and audibly let out a yawn.&nbsp;&ldquo;And I love you.&rdquo; We said our goodbyes, and I hung up the phone so I could get ready for breakfast with Gemma.</i></p><p><i>After we ate; we met up with Grimmy once his breakfast show was done for the day, and did some shopping. We ended up in a supermarket to pick some things up for Gem, before we were to part; and I was to head home and pack.</i></p><p><i>In the supermarket; I ventured off to grab some snacks I&rsquo;d been craving before going to look for Nick and Gemma again. I found them in the aisle where the feminine hygeine products were, just as Gem was placing a box of tampons into her basket.</i></p><p>&ldquo;You women have it so hard,&rdquo; Nick stated sympathetically as they turned to look at me, and that&rsquo;s when it clicked.</p><p>&ldquo;Holy shit,&rdquo; I said aloud, and dropped the box of cookies I was holding. Panic started to take over my body, and I began hyperventilating as I looked at the two of them with wide eyes.&nbsp;&ldquo;Oh my god&hellip; Oh my GOD.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N, what&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; Gemma asked; concern written well across her features.&nbsp;&ldquo;Are you not feeling well again?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m late,&rdquo; I whispered as tears began pricking my eyes.&nbsp;&ldquo;Oh my god, I&rsquo;m so late.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Late?&rdquo; Gemma questioned, still clearly confused.&nbsp;&ldquo;Late to where?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No not late somewhere&hellip; <b>I&rsquo;m</b> late,&rdquo; I tried to explain between shaky breathes.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to have to elaborate, love,&rdquo; Nick said as I put a hand on my chest in attempt to steady my breathing, and calm the hell down.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;My <b>period</b> is late,&rdquo; I blurted out and their eyes widened. These were the two who knew first hand just how sick I&rsquo;d been recently, and I wasn&rsquo;t suprised it was Gemma who picked up on what I was getting at first.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh my- Y/N, do you think you might be?&rdquo; She gasped as her face lit up, and tried to contain the excitement she was clearly feeling.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; I said, and ran a hand through my hair as glanced down at my stomach.&nbsp;&ldquo;But it makes sense.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve still lost me,&rdquo; Nick spoke up and also looked to my stomach, his eyes instantly widening as he registered what we&rsquo;re talking about. A huge smile took over his features, and he clapped his hands together loudly. &nbsp;&ldquo;No fucking way! My boy might be a dad, and you might be a mum! This is great.&rdquo;</p><p><i>Three pregnancy tests, and a trip to the doctor later; it was determined that I was indeed pregnant&hellip; And I was completely terrified to tell Harry.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>I went the next couple of days only also sharing the news with Anne; who was overly excited, and made Nick and Gemma vow to keep it a secret until I was ready to tell Harry&hellip; I decided I&rsquo;d man up and tell him&nbsp;after his second show at MSG, but had to figure out how I was going to do so.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>Anne, Gemma, and I arrived in New York City the day before H&rsquo;s first concert. I got to spend some quality time with him that day, and we even had a nice romantic dinner&hellip; But I still didn&rsquo;t have the guts to tell him. We were all here for him. The fact that he sold out Madison Square Garden two nights in a row on his first ever solo world tour was huge, and there was no way I was taking that away from him.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>His first night was a complete success, and I was so incredibly proud. He preformed amazingly, and the crowd was loving every moment of it. Before the show, I&rsquo;d gone through the stadium to the merch stands and decided to buy myself a purple&nbsp;&lsquo;kiwi&rsquo; sweater because <b>someone&nbsp;</b>never got me one. The people working at the stand greeted me with huge smiles, and tried to prevent me from giving them any money; but I insisted otherwise.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>I also purchased a hair tie set, and just as I was about to pay I saw the button set; and an I idea formed in my mind. One of the buttons said &lsquo;I&rsquo;m Having Your Baby,&rsquo; and I couldn&rsquo;t stand the irony of it. That&rsquo;s how I was going to tell him I was pregnant. Give him the button, walk away, and see how he handles it&hellip; Great plan.</i></p><p><i>The second night was just as amazing as the first, and so the celebrations that took place afterwards started off in full swing with everyone there. It began with the group of us&nbsp;playing pool, but escalated pretty&nbsp;quickly.</i></p><p><i>&nbsp;Later into the night, Harry was well past the point of buzzed; and was full on sloppy drunk. I hadn&rsquo;t had one sip of alcohol for obvious reasons, and that didn&rsquo;t go unnoticed by Harry. However, I was able to brush it off as it being because I was still sick; the fact that I&rsquo;d spent a good twenty minutes next to the toilet that morning was enough for him to go along with that story.</i></p><p><i>I&rsquo;d separated myself from the group as it became very crowded, and my stomach began to churn. I rushed to the washroom and emptied my stomach once again; hoping the little squish in there would give me some relief from the nausea sooner rather than later.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>I flushed the toilet and went to wash my hands; making a mental note to get some more water to try to get the taste of vomit out of my mouth. I finished rinsing the soap off my hands just as the washroom door swung open, and two pairs of footsteps walked in.</i></p><p>&ldquo;Y/N there you are,&rdquo; a voice said and I turned to see Sarah and Clare smiling back at me.&nbsp;</p><p><i>&ldquo;Hey ladies,&rdquo; I greeted them with a genuine smile.&nbsp;&ldquo;Having fun? You&rsquo;s did amazing tonight by the way.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re too kind,&rdquo; Sarah replied.&nbsp;&ldquo;But this place is filling up pretty fast with people, I may see if Mitch wants to leave soon before it get&rsquo;s too crowded.&rdquo;</i></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m ready to call it a night as well,&rdquo; Clare added. &ldquo;We could all just head back to the hotel together.&rdquo; I nodded in agreement; extremely exhausted from the past few days, and still kind of jet lagged.&nbsp;&ldquo;Adam&rsquo;s already left to be with the kids&hellip; But speaking of kids&hellip; Is it true Y/N?&rdquo;</p><p><i>I looked at her oddly before I&rsquo;d registered what she was asking, and my eyes widened.&nbsp;&ldquo;Uhm I uh,&rdquo; I stuttered and the two of them chuckled.</i></p><p>&ldquo;She totally&rsquo;s got a bun in the oven,&rdquo; Sarah said, causing my face to redden. She smiles at me gently before glancing at Clare.&nbsp;&ldquo;Anne may have told us.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; I muttered.&nbsp;&ldquo;Wait, Harry doesn&rsquo;t know yet does he?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No hun, you&rsquo;re fine,&rdquo; Clare stated and stepped towards me.&nbsp;&ldquo;Just us, Mitch, Adam, and whoever else you&rsquo;ve told.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Ok good,&rdquo; I said and patted the button that was in my pocket.&nbsp;&ldquo;I was going to tell him tonight, but it may have to wait until morning.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Understandable,&rdquo; Sarah replied and I smiled.&nbsp;&ldquo;Now I don&rsquo;t know about you two, but I&rsquo;m ready to go wander this city a bit and eventually get some sleep.&rdquo;</p><p><i>&ldquo;I hear you on that one,&rdquo; I told her.&nbsp;&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll go collect my boyfriend.&rdquo; The two girls nodded in understanding, and we all made our way back to where everyone was.</i></p><p>We made small talk as we went, and just as we were about to round the corner; an aggravated voice was raised.&nbsp;&ldquo;Harry, that&rsquo;s not Y/N!&rdquo;</p><p><i>I stepped around the corner with Sarah and Clare behind me, and was met by one of the worst sights I&rsquo;d ever seen in my entire life. No more than five feet away was Mitch desperately trying to pull Harry away from a girl he was full on making out with. My heart plummeted as I watched his right hand tangle into the girls same coloured hair as me, and his left hand grab a handful of the somewhat similar looking dress to what I was wearing; all while who I&rsquo;m assuming were the girls friends snickered, and took photos from a few more feet away.</i></p><p>&ldquo;Oh my god,&rdquo; Clare said and a sob escaped my mouth.&nbsp;</p><p><i>Hurt, anger, betrayl, sadness, pregnancy hormones&hellip; It was all racing through me as Harry finally let himself be pulled away from the girl, and turned around to give Mitch a glare. I watched as he went to say something, but then his gaze moved back and was met by my tear filled one. His eyes widened as soon as he noticed me, and he instantly moved in my direction; glancing between me and the other girl as if realizing we were two different people.</i></p><p><i>I quickly turned on my heel, and tried to make a b-line for the exit out of there.&nbsp;&ldquo;Y/N, wait!&rdquo; Harry&rsquo;s voice called after me, but I couldn&rsquo;t care less as I continued for the door; until a hand wrapped around my wrist and held me back.&nbsp;&ldquo;Let me explain.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>I let out a sarcastic laugh as the tears streamed from my eyes, before I whipped around to face him.&nbsp;&ldquo;No Harry, you don&rsquo;t get to explain,&rdquo; I yelled and ripped my arm away from his hold. His features were evident with shock, and even fear as he visibly was sobering up; but was all replaced with desperation as my hand moved to my left ring finger. I slid off the engagement ring he had proposed to me with, and grabbed his hand. I pryed open his fingers from the fist he had them in, before placing the ring on his palm and closing his fingers around it. &ldquo;I want you to stay away from me.&rdquo; I told him as my eyes met his tear filled green ones, and&nbsp;I reached into my pocket to grab the button.&nbsp;&ldquo;And I want you to stay the </i><b><i>hell</i></b><i> away from this baby.&rdquo;&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>I chucked the button at his feet, and turned away from him; not allowing myself to see his reaction as I went out the door and hopped into the nearest cab, driving off and not looking back.</i></p><p><i><b>Emma&rsquo;s POV *back in present*</b></i></p><p>&ldquo;And that&rsquo;s how it all happened,&rdquo; mum says and concludes her story, as Darcy, Ethan, and I stare at her in awe.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;So it was a drunken mistake,&rdquo; Ethan states and looks at the ground; trying to wrap his head around the whole thing.&nbsp;&ldquo;Did this girl even look like you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;From a distance, yes,&rdquo; mum tells him with a nod.&nbsp;&ldquo;But I was pretty caught up in the moment, I didn&rsquo;t even register that part of it at all.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think anyone could expect you too, mum,&rdquo; Darcy speaks up, and I nod my head in agreement.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;When I found out your father made out with this other girl because he thought she was me, I felt like I was crazy for the way I reacted,&rdquo; she continues to explain.&nbsp;&ldquo;But I couldn&rsquo;t help it, it just hurt so much.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I bet no one blamed you for the way you reacted,&rdquo; I tell her honestly.&nbsp;&ldquo;Plus you were pregnant, that would&rsquo;ve only made it so much harder to control your emotions.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got that right, Squirt,&rdquo; my dad&rsquo;s voice speaks up as he walks over to the four of us.&nbsp;&ldquo;Is it alright if I join?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I guess,&rdquo; I say dramatically, but shift over a bit so he can sit between mum and I. He winks at me, and nudges my shoulder with his as he sits down. &ldquo;So what happened after that? How long were you&rsquo;s broken up for?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Just a week,&rdquo; mum tells me with a laugh.&nbsp;&ldquo;Kind of pathetic, right?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Kind of pathetic?&rdquo; dad scoffs and places an arm around her shoulders.&nbsp;&ldquo;You say that as if it wasn&rsquo;t one of the hardest weeks of m&rsquo;life&hellip; I was a disaster.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And so was I,&rdquo; she continues and looks up at him.&nbsp;&ldquo;I felt like there was this huge hole after I stormed out of that bar. And then I started panicking because I was freaking pregnant&hellip; it was just a mess.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What made you guys work it out?&rdquo; Ethan asks from mum&rsquo;s other side.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; dad started with a chuckle.&nbsp;&ldquo;For the first few days, your mum wouldn&rsquo;t have anything to do with me. I didn&rsquo;t know what to do. I&rsquo;d made a very stupid mistake, she broke up with me, <i>and</i> told me that she was pregnant all at once. It all hit me like a brick wall.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So what made you&rsquo;s finally talk?&rdquo; Darcy questions and sits up straight.</p><p>&ldquo;That entire week your Aunt&rsquo;s Gemma, Sarah, and Clare, as well as your Grandma and Uncle Adam tried so hard to get me to hear you dad out. Even your Uncle Jeff took part in that, and I&rsquo;d even received a call from Grimmy trying to convince me to do the same;&nbsp;but I wasn&rsquo;t having it.&rdquo; Mum continues to explain.&nbsp;&ldquo;The week had almost fully gone by, and I was preparing for my flight back to London when I got a call from your Uncle Mitch. Mitch never called me so I knew it was <i>something</i> worth listening too, which is why I answered. I barely got a hello in, before he completely went off about the whole thing. He explained the entire situation, from how your dad&rsquo;s actions with that girl happened because he thought it was me, to how completely and utterly distraught he was after the whole thing happened. And it gave me a different perspective.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If it wasn&rsquo;t for Mitch doing that, I may have never gotten that call from your mum, and we may have never worked it out,&rdquo; dad adds in.&nbsp;&ldquo;The whole thing happened because of my stupidity, and I&rsquo;m still so happy your mum gave another chance; even thought I didn&rsquo;t deserve it.&nbsp;But words also can&rsquo;t express how thankful I am that Mitch called her, because otherwise she may have never&nbsp;listened. And we may not be where we are now.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Eth, if Uncle Mitch didn&rsquo;t do that we may have never been born,&rdquo; I state in shock as I lean forward to look at my twin.</p><p>Mum and dad both laugh at my statement, but I thought it was valid.&nbsp;&ldquo;I guess you&rsquo;re right, Em,&rdquo; mum says.&nbsp;&ldquo;Your&nbsp;Uncle Mitch and I became a lot closer after that. I was always close with Sarah, Clare, and Adam; not saying I wasn&rsquo;t with Mitch, but he&nbsp;sometimes is just so quiet, and it can come off as him distancing himself. Nonetheless, after your dad and I worked things out, and the tour had ended; we called the engagement back on, and we began planning our future life as parents.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I think it all turned out pretty well,&rdquo; Darcy speaks up again from her spot on the gound.&nbsp;&ldquo;But hey, that&rsquo;s totally why Aunt Sarah and Uncle Mitch are my godparents isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That it is, Squish,&rdquo; dad replies, and sends her a wink as he moves to stand up.&nbsp;&ldquo;But now that you&rsquo;s know all of this, I vote we go eat some dinner. It&rsquo;s been a long couple hours, yeah?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;It really has,&rdquo; mum agrees and squeezes his knee. They both stand up and snake each others arm around the other&rsquo;s waist. I watch as they both look at each other lovingly, and dad leans down to plant a soft kiss on her lips; causing my heart to freaking melt.&nbsp;&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go make something, and call you&rsquo;s when it&rsquo;s ready.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I think she means dad will make something, because he doesn&rsquo;t let her help out of fear she&rsquo;ll burn the food,&rdquo; Ethan mutters, and earns himself a scowl from mum as dad laughs. She goes to say something, but dad is quick to distract her and pull her into the house; all while trying to keep himself from laughing harder.&nbsp;&ldquo;Sometimes their sappiness is nauseating.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sometimes you&rsquo;re nauseating,&rdquo; I snap at my twin with a scoff.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Geez Em,&rdquo; Dracy spits out between laughs at my statement, and Ethan rolls his eyes.</p><p>I smile down at my big sister, and move my gaze back to the doors where I can see dad playfully trying to whip mum with a dish towel as he chases her around the kitchen, and can&rsquo;t help but smile.&nbsp;&ldquo;All I know is that if I don&rsquo;t have a love like theirs, it&rsquo;s not even worth it.&rdquo;</p></p>",

He\u2019s been working on seating arrangements for the past hour and getting more frustrated by the minute. Louis huffs out a breath and glances down at Harry with a soft smile on his lips before he returns to the task at hand. It\u2019s easy, right then, for Harry to let himself believe that they\u2019re planning a seating chart for their own wedding and bickering over who is going to sit where from a list of their own family members.

He&rsquo;s been working on seating arrangements for the past hour and getting more frustrated by the minute. Louis huffs out a breath and glances down at Harry with a soft smile on his lips before he returns to the task at hand. It&rsquo;s easy, right then, for Harry to let himself believe that they&rsquo;re planning a seating chart for their own wedding and bickering over who is going to sit where from a list of their own family members. He can let himself daydream about a white picket fence and a dog that they could have within the next year.</p><p>It&rsquo;s like a cold slap in the face when Harry looks to the top of the page to see &ldquo;Aiden and Louis Grimshaw&rdquo; at the head table, and Harry has to mentally remind himself for the thousandth time that Louis is not his. Never was, really. He&rsquo;s just the wedding planner that&rsquo;s been in love with Louis since he was sixteen.</p><p><i>Words: 76907</i></p><p>9. <b><a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fdownload.archiveofourown.org%2Fworks%2F4129852&amp;t=ZTMwZGQxN2Y4MzBjYTZlMmYwMjc0MjUzNjhjYTg5NDFiOGEwYTI0NiwzNDAwOWYwODAxMmMyYWY0YjcwOWY1ZmM2Y2I3YTQxMWYyNzVhYTZh\">Even The Stars Fall For You</a> </b>by<b> <i><a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Farchiveofourown.org%2Fusers%2FLarry_Darling0124%2Fprofile&amp;t=ZDI2YTViMmI0NjIyZTQ2ZmIyY2UwYmIyMzE0YWYxNDA3Yzg5YTYyNCxkZmE2MTI3NTVjYjlkZWM2NTU1MmExMzRkNDRlOTc2YmI3OWU1MTYx\">Larry_Darling0124</a></i></b></p><p>Summary:</p><p>Louis W.
