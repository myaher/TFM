It was a stormy night. At that time, Retsuko was quite the studious one, but she was a pre-teen girl, understand. She had her own personal interests growing, and it was conflicting with our own interests. She had become interested in some boy, the name escapes me at the moment, and&hellip;.well, outside of Ryoko, none of us were particularly supportive of her.\u00a0\u201cOh, you\u2019re too young, that goes against the code of this family,\u201d and so on, and so on.</p><p><b>Haida:</b> Yeah?</p><p><b>Rie:</b> &hellip;.she&hellip;.she didn\u2019t take it well.

W-we had seen it before, but somehow, it was stronger than we ever expected. Within the span of about two minutes, she had taken out almost 80% of the house.

She took the method of\u00a0\u201cfighting fire with fire.:</p><p><b>Haida:</b> &hellip;.o-oh.</p><p><b>Rie:</b> Yes. Ryota tried to take her down with simple straining methods, but it never worked. We were worried Retsuko would start attacking the town, so, Ryoko unleashed her rage, and the two battled. It took about 15 minutes, but eventually Retsuko passed out, and fell&hellip;..unfortunately, Ryoko fell too.</p><p><b>Haida:</b> &hellip;.\u201dunfortunately\u201d?</p><p><b>Rie:</b> &hellip;.*sigh* all the energy from her was put into that fight, and once it was done, she had her final breaths&hellip;.hmm, it\u2019s interesting. She loved Retsuko. More than I think anyone in this family ever did&hellip;.and when she fought her&hellip;I don\u2019t know if the thought of attacking her was so devastating, she didn\u2019t want to keep going in life, or that she was willing to sacrifice her own life, just to protect her granddaughter&hellip;</p><p><b>Haida:</b> &hellip;oh&hellip;.I-I\u2019m so sorry.<br/></p><p><b>Rie:</b> It\u2019s fine&hellip;it\u2019s old news, anyway&hellip;.in any case, we hid that story from Retsuko, as much as we could. She only remembers she got mad. Nothing more. The house, we just said the storm took it down. Ryoko, we said she died peacefully in her sleep. The latter made Retsuko very upset, but at least she never had the guilt haunt her.</p><p><b>Haida:</b> &hellip;oh god&hellip;</p><p><b>Rie:</b> Since then, Ryota had been especially stoic, and strict in the household. And Retsuko&hellip;.by our own ways, she became much less carefree, and more&hellip;.for a lack of a better word, respectable. Not that she wasn\u2019t before, but it was especially prevalent.</p><p><b>Haida:</b> &hellip;truthfully, she is always like that, at our workplace.</p><p><b>Rie:</b> I see&hellip;&hellip;we hadn\u2019t seen that rage come back since&hellip;have you?</p><p><b>Haida:</b> She mainly keeps it private, but yes, I\u2019ve seen it. Mostly whenever we go to karaoke, and she plays death metal.</p><p><b>Rie:</b> Huh. *smirks* I guess that was something that was never going to change!</p><p><b>Haida:</b> Yeah&hellip;you think she needs to know?</p><p><b>Rie:</b> *sigh* She might&hellip;but until then, she seems happy enough, so that\u2019s how it\u2019ll probably always be.</p><p><b>Haida:</b> Alright. *the two start to walk out, unaware of who\u2019s in front of them*</p><p><b>Rie:</b> I\u2019ll tell you something, though.

AND NOW, YOU WILL <b>PAY.</b></p><p><b>Ryota: </b>&hellip;..Ryuu, Riko, go to your mother.</p><p><b>Riko:</b> Wha-</p><p><b>Ryota:</b> GO!</p><p><b>Ryuu:</b> *he and Riko run behind Rie* What the hell is going on?!</p><p><b>Rie:</b> I-I don\u2019t know&hellip;<br/></p><p><b>Haida:</b> &hellip;it\u2019s gonna be bad.</p><p><b>Ryota:</b> &hellip;.so.

You want to know why we never told you why, yes, you DID kill her, and why I never was able to look at you the same way ever again? *a familiar aura starts surrounding him* Hmmph. Alright. And perhaps you\u2019re right. I have no clue how much we hurt you. Much like how you don\u2019t know how much you hurt us. Especially me. But don\u2019t you worry, I\u2019ll answer everything you asked of me. And as for me paying&hellip;.well&hellip;..*he turns into a similar demonic rage face* HERE\u2019S MY PAYMENT.</p>",

She loved Retsuko. More than I think anyone in this family ever did&hellip;.and when she fought her&hellip;I don&rsquo;t know if the thought of attacking her was so devastating, she didn&rsquo;t want to keep going in life, or that she was willing to sacrifice her own life, just to protect her granddaughter&hellip;</p><p><b>Haida:</b> &hellip;oh&hellip;.I-I&rsquo;m so sorry.<br /></p><p><b>Rie:</b> It&rsquo;s fine&hellip;it&rsquo;s old news, anyway&hellip;.in any case, we hid that story from Retsuko, as much as we could. She only remembers she got mad. Nothing more. The house, we just said the storm took it down. Ryoko, we said she died peacefully in her sleep. The latter made Retsuko very upset, but at least she never had the guilt haunt her.</p><p><b>Haida:</b> &hellip;oh god&hellip;</p><p><b>Rie:</b> Since then, Ryota had been especially stoic, and strict in the household. And Retsuko&hellip;.by our own ways, she became much less carefree, and more&hellip;.for a lack of a better word, respectable. Not that she wasn&rsquo;t before, but it was especially prevalent.</p><p><b>Haida:</b> &hellip;truthfully, she is always like that, at our workplace.</p><p><b>Rie:</b> I see&hellip;&hellip;we hadn&rsquo;t seen that rage come back since&hellip;have you?</p><p><b>Haida:</b> She mainly keeps it private, but yes, I&rsquo;ve seen it. Mostly whenever we go to karaoke, and she plays death metal.</p><p><b>Rie:</b> Huh. *smirks* I guess that was something that was never going to change!</p><p><b>Haida:</b> Yeah&hellip;you think she needs to know?</p><p><b>Rie:</b> *sigh* She might&hellip;but until then, she seems happy enough, so that&rsquo;s how it&rsquo;ll probably always be.</p><p><b>Haida:</b> Alright. *the two start to walk out, unaware of who&rsquo;s in front of them*</p><p><b>Rie:</b> I&rsquo;ll tell you something, though. There have only been two times, I can think of, when my husband cried. The first was when Retsuko was born, and the second was the night&hellip;*sees who just saw them*&hellip;Ryoko died&hellip;</p><p><b>Haida:</b> What, what&rsquo;s wro-*sees who it is*&hellip;.oh, god&hellip;</p><p>*it&rsquo;s Retsuko, with a thousand yard stare, trembling, her mouth agape*</p><p><b>Rie:</b> &hellip;w-welcome back, sweetheart! I suppose you got everything you ne-</p><p><b>Retsuko:</b> So THAT&rsquo;S why she died?! I killed her?!

YOU LIED TO ME!</b></p><p><b>Rie:</b> It was for your own good, Retsuko!</p><p><b>Retsuko:</b> Mine, or yours?! *runs off, with a sudden hint of death metal permeating her* WHERE&rsquo;S DAD?!</p><p><b>Rie:</b> *follows her* Retsuko, wait!</p><p><b>Haida:</b> *follows suit* Come back!</p><p>*all when this happened&hellip;*<br /></p><p><b>Harumi:</b> *she and Hisoka were standing right beside Retsuko when this transpired* &hellip;.</p><p><b>Hisoka:</b> &hellip;.</p><p><b>Harumi:</b> &hellip;..well, I guess we have to unload all the groceries.</p><p><b>Hisoka:</b> Indeed&hellip;.you know, aside from that inner demon battle murder thing, I really like her! :)</p><p><b>Harumi:</b> Me too!

You want to know why we never told you why, yes, you DID kill her, and why I never was able to look at you the same way ever again? *a familiar aura starts surrounding him* Hmmph. Alright. And perhaps you&rsquo;re right. I have no clue how much we hurt you. Much like how you don&rsquo;t know how much you hurt us. Especially me. But don&rsquo;t you worry, I&rsquo;ll answer everything you asked of me. And as for me paying&hellip;.well&hellip;..*he turns into a similar demonic rage face* HERE&rsquo;S MY PAYMENT.</p>",
