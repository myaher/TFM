While close with his mother Maria, his relationship with his father Howard was predominantly strained, a great deal of distance growing between the two as the years went by. But his world came crumbling down when his parents were involved in a car accident in December 1991, an incident which would later be discovered as a staged assassination by HYDRA at the hands of the Winter Soldier. Stark Industries was left in turmoil and Obadiah Stane was left to pick up the pieces. Though successful in the eyes of Forbes and Wall Street, the company fell under dark and uncertain times, even as \u201cthe prodigal son\u201d finally took an active interest and became CEO. Creating a series of industry defining designs, Tony\u2019s leadership saw the business\u2019s shares skyrocketing, their notoriety for being technological pioneers preceding them as they attained military funding to provide the US with weapons for use in hostile territories overseas.</small></p><p><small>During a demo of the billionaire\u2019s latest feat of engineering, the Jericho Missile, in Afghanistan, his privileged lifestyle fell under threat. Captured by the Ten Rings and wounded by shrapnel from his own weapon, the terrorist cell demanded he make a replica of the missile in order to ensure his freedom or die by their hand. Knowing his captors would never keep up their end of the bargain, Tony created an armored suit powered by an arc reactor with the help of Ho Yinsen. After three months of work, they enacted their escape plan. While Yinsen didn\u2019t survive, his message stayed with Tony: don\u2019t waste your life. Tony overhauled his business strategy - adopting more diverse directions in innovation, ceasing all development in weapons, and utilizing repulsor technology to bring about patented Clean Energy across the world.</small></p><p><small>Tony went on to become a founding member of the Avengers. The Chitauri Invasion that brought them together as a team, also left Tony deeply unsettled. The prospect of Earth being so vulnerable left him striving to protect it no matter how unorthodox his methods. The peace his efforts gained was short-lived, the Avengers\u2019 efforts to secure the cosmic safety of Earth from the threat of Thanos left them vulnerable for Skrulls to infiltrate. Veranke\u2019s forces replaced key figures in society with their own foot soldiers, including Steve Rogers. The Skrull who took his place, Pitt'o, was captured and interrogated by Bucky Barnes. When Tony covertly rendezvoused with the pair, Pitt'o activated a virus which affected the digital signature of the billionaire\u2019s arc reactor. The infiltration of the device left Tony increasingly sick and taken into the care of S.H.I.E.L.D. due to the virus\u2019 corruption spreading across the entirety of the Stark Network, affecting international communications and security. Unable to be at the forefront of the fight against the extraterrestrials, Stark helped behind the scenes, but the plight took a heavy impact on Stark Industries reputation and even moreso on Tony\u2019s sense of well-being.</small></p><p><small>With the Skrulls defeated, the Network was back online with advanced security measures in place. In a bid to rebuild its ranking in the world, Stark Industries announced the Starkdynamics event in Tokyo, an international think-tank comprising of a global consortium of brilliant people developing paradigm shifting concepts. While several companies showcased their work and research, Tony delivered a keynote speech announcing Project Epsilon, an effort that marked the procurement of Extremis, a carefully crafted virus which harnessed the bioelectrical potential to hack and upgrade the human repair center. Extremis offered the prospect of accelerated healing, boosted immune systems, and organ regeneration. Tony\u2019s personal goal for the project was to heal himself of the shrapnel injuries he had sustained in Afghanistan that made him dependent upon his arc reactor technology. Harry Osborn - in a similar vein - saw the potential for Extremis to cure his inherited, terminal disease. Osborn approached the Avenger with the offer of collaboration. Despite tensions, the two came to an agreement and selected the best minds they knew to aid them in their research, the team making a breakthrough.</small></p><p><small>With newfound single-minded focus on his work, Tony discovered Oscorp files of questionable content, including connections to the Ravencroft Institute\u2019s dabblings in human experimentation and schematics on patented Stark Industries technology. The discovery brought about a full breakdown of communication between the two CEOs as Tony began shutting Osborn out. In the following weeks, he staged a hackathon, hiring Yelena Belova to retrieve the Extremis sample from Oscorp\u2019s Brooklyn lab. The young CEO\u2019s health rapidly deteriorated with the strain of events, ushering in the Green Goblin who carried out several attacks against Stark Industries\u2019 facilities, leaving almost a hundred casualties in their wake. During an attack at Avengers Mansion, the two clashed and Stark was left severely wounded, his arc reactor destroyed, and - if not for the assistance of Loki, who had his own grudges against the Goblin - left for dead.</small></p><p><small>Delivered to the Baxter Building and with Extremis administered, Tony learned the Goblin\u2019s true identity. The two enhanced corporate moguls battled it out over Manhattan, ending in a destructive stalemate over the East River, both participants plunging into the depths below as lower Manhattan was thrown into darkness at the hands of an explosive EMP burst set off by the Goblin in one final act of vengeance. The faithful A.I., J.A.R.V.I.S., aided its creator at the conclusion of the dire situation, piloting the Iron Man suit to a safe location as New York City began to recover from the disastrous outcome of the brawl. The United Nations World Security Council resolved to take necessary action to counter the rising tide of an increasingly unaccountable enhanced vigilante community. With immense pressure placed upon S.H.I.E.L.D. to direct the momentum of such a measure, the Agreement Concerning Cooperation, Oversight and Registration of Discovered Superhumans (Accords) were soon subject to a first draft. Stark was the first Avenger to view it, and - in the aftermath of Extremis - became its first supporter based on his sheer guilt for the damage caused to the city, including of the death of one of S.H.I.E.L.D.\u2019s young pilots.</small></p><p><small>While the Avengers met amongst themselves to discuss their course of action only to find themselves on opposite sides of a fence, Tony became increasingly involved in the support of the Accords. Stark Industries provided stringent protocols required for the database of registrants and Tony became the public face of registration. During a gesture of good will, the World Security Council offered a ceremonial signing of the Accords on S.H.I.E.L.D.\u2018s Iliad Helicarrier to Steve Rogers and Bucky Barnes. With inside string-pulling from HYDRA, the public was led to believe that the bureaucratic olive branch spiraled into a terrorist attack as the Helicarrier crashed into Liberty Island. Both Barnes and Rogers were implicated in the attack and forced underground. The event was enough to sway public opinion and registration became mandatory for all enhanced individuals, the billionaire tasked with finding the pair.</small></p></blockquote><h2><b>\u2261 CURRENTLY</b></h2><blockquote><p><small>As events unfolded, it was found that individuals detained at the Hart Island Facility were subjected to less than humane conditions and Tony\u2019s opinion shifting to aid his fellow teammates during this desperate time. The Avengers disbanded shortly after the light shone on Hart Island unveiled its ugly truths. Tensions still strain high between the heroes as they aspire to return to their days of glory.</small></p></blockquote><h2><b>\u2261 NOTE</b></h2><blockquote><p><small>FightAsOne has Thor Odinson, Clint Barton, Carol Danvers, Bucky Barnes, and other various characters associated with Tony Stark.</small></p></blockquote><p><small>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u2192 </small><a href=\"http://fightasone.tumblr.com/jointhegroup\"><small>HOW TO JOIN</small></a> <small>\u2192 <a href=\"http://fightasone.tumblr.com/faq\">FAQ </a>\u2192 <a href=\"http://fightasone.tumblr.com/rules\">RULES</a></small> <small>\u2192 </small><small><a href=\"http://fightasone.tumblr.com/mostwanted\">MOST WANTED</a></small></p>",

While close with his mother Maria, his relationship with his father Howard was predominantly strained, a great deal of distance growing between the two as the years went by. But his world came crumbling down when his parents were involved in a car accident in December 1991, an incident which would later be discovered as a staged assassination by HYDRA at the hands of the Winter Soldier. Stark Industries was left in turmoil and Obadiah Stane was left to pick up the pieces. Though successful in the eyes of Forbes and Wall Street, the company fell under dark and uncertain times, even as &ldquo;the prodigal son&rdquo; finally took an active interest and became CEO.

Not even Dum-E\u2019s boundless enthusiasm will be \nenough to get the congealed black mass out again.</p><p>\u201cWhat where you trying to do?\u201d Tony asks as he takes \nthe pot from Steve\u2019s hands and dowses the still smoking remains with \nwater before he throws it into the trash.</p><p>\u201cIt is my turn to cook,\u201d Steve says sheepishly. To \nmake matters worse, he angles towards the trash can as if he \ncontemplates getting the pot back out.</p><p>\u201cYou call this cooking?\u201d It is all Tony can do not to\n raise his hands over his head and scream to the heavens. The Italian \nblood in his veins is shouting for murder. \u201cThis is atrocious.

If they had known about Steve\u2019s horrid cooking skills, they need \nnot have turned him into a supersoldier. They could have simply clad him\n in an apron and sent him to the Nazis as a cook. The war would have \nbeen over before it even began. Battles are not fought well on an empty \nstomach, and this is outright poison.</p><p>\u201cI got distracted making salad,\u201d Steve tries to excuse himself but falls silent when Tony glares at him.</p><p>\u201cYou get distracted by lifeless greenery and turn \nyour back on the real-life bomb you\u2019ve cooked up yourself?\u201d Tony shakes \nhis head. He wonders how someone with Steve\u2019s metabolism managed to get \nthrough life without learning at least the basics of cooking.</p><p>Making real spaghetti is an art, Tony will be the \nfirst to admit that, but by that he means making them from scratch and \nwith real Italian flavour to it. Every idiot can make noodles. Except \nfor, apparently, their fearless leader.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t have much practice,\u201d Steve says, but it sounds so much like a threadbare excuse that Tony clicks his tongue.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me any nonsense about the Great \nDepression,\u201d Tony replies flippantly. He takes the second pot from the \nstove and pushes it right under Steve\u2019s nose. He should face his own \nshame. \u201cIf you didn\u2019t have much food, you should have learned not to \nwaste any.\u201d</p><p>Steve narrows his eyes at Tony, then at the ruined spaghetti. \u201cThat\u2019s \u2013 not how it works,\u201d he protests weakly.</p><p>In turn, Tony is occupied with poking at the noodles,\n grimacing when they blob together, already dissolving, horribly \novercooked. Once he deigns them as unsalvageable, they follow Steve\u2019s \nattempt at a sauce into the trash. The waste hurts, and that despite \nTony never having lacked for anything in his life. Nothing material \nanyway.</p><p>He looks around in the kitchen, at the unapologetic \nmess Steve has left behind. Fight or flight, he thinks. Tony almost \nregrets that he has never been the kind to back down.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d he says and shrugs out of his suit jacket, \n\u201cthat\u2019s how it works now.\u201d He has a meeting in half an hour, but surely \nPepper will understand that this is more important. They cannot leave \nCaptain America uneducated.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Steve asks when, within only a few moments, Tony makes the kitchen his again.</p><p>He stacks all the empty packages and bags, brushes \nthe wrangled ruins of cut vegetables remaining on the counters off into \nthe trash can, and wipes the countertops clean before Steve even \nrealizes what is happening.</p><p>Picking up two clean cutting boards and knives, Tony \nsets up two work stations. He is looking into the fridge, getting out \nfresh \u2013 and suitable \u2013 food, when he realizes that Steve is still not \nmoving.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to show you how to cook,\u201d he says, expecting that to explain everything.</p><p>Steve, however, merely stares. \u201cYou know how to cook?\u201d</p><p>Tony supposes he must make for an unexpected picture,\n standing in business clothes in front of the open fridge. They have \nnever seen him here other than to get new coffee or sit down for \ntake-out or food someone else has cooked. As a billionaire and \nconstantly busy man, he thinks he should forgive Steve his doubt, but \nthe open scepticism still hurt his pride.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m half-Italian, honey,\u201d Tony counters, rolling his\n eyes. Having loaded his arms full of ingredients, he pushes the fridge \nclose with his hip. \u201cOf course I can cook.\u201d</p><p>While Tony arranges everything he needs around his \ncutting board, Steve stares. When Tony begins cutting onion and garlic \nwith a speed that is usually reserved for flicking through blueprints, \nSteve stares. When Tony picks spices without hesitation and smiles at \ntheir scent, Steve stares. When Tony haggles two pots and saves Steve\u2019s \nattempt at a salad at the same time, Steve stares.</p><p>To give him credit, Steve also nods at everything \nTony says, and manages to cut one zucchini in the time that Tony needs \nfor all the other vegetables. He remembers which box contains the \noregano when Tony asks him to add some more to the sauce. And he knows \nwhat al dente is supposed to be, if not how to get there.</p><p>So, Steve is not hopeless, but throughout all of it \nhe does not stop staring. He is most interested in Tony\u2019s hands and the \nway he manages to not get stains on his clothes. At the end of it, he \nlooks at Tony with utter awe.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d Tony says, holding out a spoon with sauce. \u201cI\u2019m not sure if it needs more pepper.\u201d</p><p>Steve appears to realize too late that he could have \ntaken the spoon out of Tony\u2019s hand. Instead, he blushes as he bows down \nand lets Tony feed him. It is adorable enough that Tony refrains from \ncommenting. Especially since Steve\u2019s eyes widen and he hums contentedly.</p><p>\u201cThis is good,\u201d Steve says once he has straightened again, the colour on his cheeks still lingering.</p><p>Tony grins. People usually expect so much from him, \nwhile constantly underestimating him. He knows how to do other things \nthan build weapons and suits of armour. The workshop might be his \nfavourite place these days, but that is because real life does not leave\n him much time to waste it with cooking.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why you\u2019re surprised,\u201d Tony says, just a\n hint of a challenge in his tone. Then he turns to add some more pepper,\n just so he does not have to look at Steve when he answers.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re,\u201d Steve begins and trails off. \u201cWell \u2013 you.\u201d</p><p>Tony\u2019s grin loses some of its humour. He walks over to the cupboard to get out plates and cutlery for their always hungry group.</p><p>\u201cWhen have I ever been bad at anything?\u201d he asks, flippant, and grabs his suit jacket, putting it on like armour.</p><p>\u201cPeople,\u201d Steve answers without hesitation, but he sounds apologetic.</p><p>The thing with Steve is, Tony has resented him for \nfar longer than he has loved him, for far longer than he has known him \ntoo. There is always friction where the two of them are involved. Their \nopinions on certain topics will always differ. On the other hand, they \nsimply click. When Steve looks at him like that, Tony cannot stay put \nout.</p><p>\u201cI beg to differ,\u201d Tony drawls but does so with his \nface open again. From Steve\u2019s small relieved sigh, he knows it is \nunderstood that everything is well between them. \u201cI\u2019m fantastic with \npeople.\u201d</p><p>Fighting against a smile, Steve straightens. \u201cI mean, do you remember when you \u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen to that,\u201d Tony cuts him off, half-laughing. \nEverybody has a dozen examples of when Tony was less than able to solve a\n situation diplomatically. There is a logic to that, of course, because \nno one leaves nice people alone. No one buys weapons from a man without \nbite either. \u201cCaptain America eats my food while he\u2019s trying to insult \nme.\u201d</p><p>This sounds dangerously close to how Howard used to say, As long as you live under my roof.\n Laughter bursts from Steve\u2019s lips, though, short but honest, so Tony \nrelaxes his shoulders that have instinctively straightened.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do the dishes?\u201d Steve offers, still smiling.</p><p>\u201cNot good enough,\u201d Tony says as he pushes a stack of \nplates into Steve\u2019s hands to distribute on the table. \u201cThat\u2019s your part \nanyway. The cook doesn\u2019t have to clean.\u201d</p><p>Steve gets to setting the table without complaint and\n they work well together. Once everything is done, Tony asks JARVIS to \ninform the rest of the Avengers that dinner is ready. He turns toward \nthe giant pots of spaghetti and sauce, ready to begin piling food on the\n plates, when Steve stops him with a hand on his arm.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Tony rolls his eyes but is secretly glad. People do \nnot often thank him. \u201cI couldn\u2019t have let you starve,\u201d he says but does \nnot manage to make it sound as dismissing as he aimed for. Perhaps some \nhonesty will not hurt him this time. \u201cThen again, don\u2019t thank me yet. \nWhen\u2019s the next time you\u2019re up to cook for the team?\u201d</p><p>Steve frowns. \u201cWhy? Do you want to make sure you\u2019re \nnot home?\u201d he asks cautiously, not exactly like he thinks that Tony \nregrets wasting his past hour, but also not like he understands that \nTony has had fun.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to clear my schedule, silly.\u201d Since Steve \nis looking at him utterly dumbfounded, Tony elaborates. \u201cLet\u2019s say your \nThursday evenings are mine from now on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Steve asks. He obviously does not get where this is going.</p><p>\u201cClearly you need more lessons,\u201d Tony says, pointing \nat the trashcan with a mischievous grin. \u201cI\u2019m not going to throw you out\n any time soon, but I couldn\u2019t live myself if you starved to death or \npoisoned yourself just because you can boil water. So lessons. On \nThursdays.\u201d</p><p>Tony thinks that the way Steve\u2019s expression brightens is a good sign. Maybe they are really going to make this team thing work.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like that,\u201d Steve admits quietly but the frown is not yet completely gone. \u201cBut only if you really have time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I do.\u201d Tony does not. He never has, but that does not matter. \u201cGo ahead and pick the recipe you want to try next.\u201d</p>",

So lessons. On \nThursdays.\u201d</p><p>Tony thinks that the way Steve\u2019s expression brightens is a good sign. Maybe they are really going to make this team thing work.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like that,\u201d Steve admits quietly but the frown is not yet completely gone. \u201cBut only if you really have time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I do.\u201d Tony does not. He never has, but that does not matter. \u201cGo ahead and pick the recipe you want to try next.\u201d</p>",

Not even Dum-E\u2019s boundless enthusiasm will be \nenough to get the congealed black mass out again.</p><p>\u201cWhat where you trying to do?\u201d Tony asks as he takes \nthe pot from Steve\u2019s hands and dowses the still smoking remains with \nwater before he throws it into the trash.</p><p>\u201cIt is my turn to cook,\u201d Steve says sheepishly. To \nmake matters worse, he angles towards the trash can as if he \ncontemplates getting the pot back out.</p><p>\u201cYou call this cooking?\u201d It is all Tony can do not to\n raise his hands over his head and scream to the heavens. The Italian \nblood in his veins is shouting for murder. \u201cThis is atrocious. I mean -\u201d\n Tony stops short as his eyes fall on the other pot still sitting almost\n innocently on the stove. \u201cAre those supposed to be spaghetti?\u201d</p><p>Tony\u2019s gut heaves with the urge to either cry or \nlaugh. If they had known about Steve\u2019s horrid cooking skills, they need \nnot have turned him into a supersoldier. They could have simply clad him\n in an apron and sent him to the Nazis as a cook. The war would have \nbeen over before it even began. Battles are not fought well on an empty \nstomach, and this is outright poison.</p><p>\u201cI got distracted making salad,\u201d Steve tries to excuse himself but falls silent when Tony glares at him.</p><p>\u201cYou get distracted by lifeless greenery and turn \nyour back on the real-life bomb you\u2019ve cooked up yourself?\u201d Tony shakes \nhis head. He wonders how someone with Steve\u2019s metabolism managed to get \nthrough life without learning at least the basics of cooking.</p><p>Making real spaghetti is an art, Tony will be the \nfirst to admit that, but by that he means making them from scratch and \nwith real Italian flavour to it. Every idiot can make noodles. Except \nfor, apparently, their fearless leader.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t have much practice,\u201d Steve says, but it sounds so much like a threadbare excuse that Tony clicks his tongue.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me any nonsense about the Great \nDepression,\u201d Tony replies flippantly. He takes the second pot from the \nstove and pushes it right under Steve\u2019s nose. He should face his own \nshame. \u201cIf you didn\u2019t have much food, you should have learned not to \nwaste any.\u201d</p><p>Steve narrows his eyes at Tony, then at the ruined spaghetti. \u201cThat\u2019s \u2013 not how it works,\u201d he protests weakly.</p><p>In turn, Tony is occupied with poking at the noodles,\n grimacing when they blob together, already dissolving, horribly \novercooked. Once he deigns them as unsalvageable, they follow Steve\u2019s \nattempt at a sauce into the trash. The waste hurts, and that despite \nTony never having lacked for anything in his life. Nothing material \nanyway.</p><p>He looks around in the kitchen, at the unapologetic \nmess Steve has left behind. Fight or flight, he thinks. Tony almost \nregrets that he has never been the kind to back down.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d he says and shrugs out of his suit jacket, \n\u201cthat\u2019s how it works now.\u201d He has a meeting in half an hour, but surely \nPepper will understand that this is more important. They cannot leave \nCaptain America uneducated.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Steve asks when, within only a few moments, Tony makes the kitchen his again.</p><p>He stacks all the empty packages and bags, brushes \nthe wrangled ruins of cut vegetables remaining on the counters off into \nthe trash can, and wipes the countertops clean before Steve even \nrealizes what is happening.</p><p>Picking up two clean cutting boards and knives, Tony \nsets up two work stations. He is looking into the fridge, getting out \nfresh \u2013 and suitable \u2013 food, when he realizes that Steve is still not \nmoving.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to show you how to cook,\u201d he says, expecting that to explain everything.</p><p>Steve, however, merely stares. \u201cYou know how to cook?\u201d</p><p>Tony supposes he must make for an unexpected picture,\n standing in business clothes in front of the open fridge. They have \nnever seen him here other than to get new coffee or sit down for \ntake-out or food someone else has cooked. As a billionaire and \nconstantly busy man, he thinks he should forgive Steve his doubt, but \nthe open scepticism still hurt his pride.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m half-Italian, honey,\u201d Tony counters, rolling his\n eyes. Having loaded his arms full of ingredients, he pushes the fridge \nclose with his hip. \u201cOf course I can cook.\u201d</p><p>While Tony arranges everything he needs around his \ncutting board, Steve stares. When Tony begins cutting onion and garlic \nwith a speed that is usually reserved for flicking through blueprints, \nSteve stares. When Tony picks spices without hesitation and smiles at \ntheir scent, Steve stares. When Tony haggles two pots and saves Steve\u2019s \nattempt at a salad at the same time, Steve stares.</p><p>To give him credit, Steve also nods at everything \nTony says, and manages to cut one zucchini in the time that Tony needs \nfor all the other vegetables. He remembers which box contains the \noregano when Tony asks him to add some more to the sauce. And he knows \nwhat al dente is supposed to be, if not how to get there.</p><p>So, Steve is not hopeless, but throughout all of it \nhe does not stop staring. He is most interested in Tony\u2019s hands and the \nway he manages to not get stains on his clothes. At the end of it, he \nlooks at Tony with utter awe.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d Tony says, holding out a spoon with sauce. \u201cI\u2019m not sure if it needs more pepper.\u201d</p><p>Steve appears to realize too late that he could have \ntaken the spoon out of Tony\u2019s hand. Instead, he blushes as he bows down \nand lets Tony feed him. It is adorable enough that Tony refrains from \ncommenting. Especially since Steve\u2019s eyes widen and he hums contentedly.</p><p>\u201cThis is good,\u201d Steve says once he has straightened again, the colour on his cheeks still lingering.</p><p>Tony grins. People usually expect so much from him, \nwhile constantly underestimating him. He knows how to do other things \nthan build weapons and suits of armour. The workshop might be his \nfavourite place these days, but that is because real life does not leave\n him much time to waste it with cooking.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why you\u2019re surprised,\u201d Tony says, just a\n hint of a challenge in his tone. Then he turns to add some more pepper,\n just so he does not have to look at Steve when he answers.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re,\u201d Steve begins and trails off. \u201cWell \u2013 you.\u201d</p><p>Tony\u2019s grin loses some of its humour. He walks over to the cupboard to get out plates and cutlery for their always hungry group.</p><p>\u201cWhen have I ever been bad at anything?\u201d he asks, flippant, and grabs his suit jacket, putting it on like armour.</p><p>\u201cPeople,\u201d Steve answers without hesitation, but he sounds apologetic.</p><p>The thing with Steve is, Tony has resented him for \nfar longer than he has loved him, for far longer than he has known him \ntoo. There is always friction where the two of them are involved. Their \nopinions on certain topics will always differ. On the other hand, they \nsimply click. When Steve looks at him like that, Tony cannot stay put \nout.</p><p>\u201cI beg to differ,\u201d Tony drawls but does so with his \nface open again. From Steve\u2019s small relieved sigh, he knows it is \nunderstood that everything is well between them. \u201cI\u2019m fantastic with \npeople.\u201d</p><p>Fighting against a smile, Steve straightens. \u201cI mean, do you remember when you \u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen to that,\u201d Tony cuts him off, half-laughing. \nEverybody has a dozen examples of when Tony was less than able to solve a\n situation diplomatically. There is a logic to that, of course, because \nno one leaves nice people alone. No one buys weapons from a man without \nbite either. \u201cCaptain America eats my food while he\u2019s trying to insult \nme.\u201d</p><p>This sounds dangerously close to how Howard used to say, As long as you live under my roof.\n Laughter bursts from Steve\u2019s lips, though, short but honest, so Tony \nrelaxes his shoulders that have instinctively straightened.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do the dishes?\u201d Steve offers, still smiling.</p><p>\u201cNot good enough,\u201d Tony says as he pushes a stack of \nplates into Steve\u2019s hands to distribute on the table. \u201cThat\u2019s your part \nanyway. The cook doesn\u2019t have to clean.\u201d</p><p>Steve gets to setting the table without complaint and\n they work well together. Once everything is done, Tony asks JARVIS to \ninform the rest of the Avengers that dinner is ready. He turns toward \nthe giant pots of spaghetti and sauce, ready to begin piling food on the\n plates, when Steve stops him with a hand on his arm.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Tony rolls his eyes but is secretly glad. People do \nnot often thank him. \u201cI couldn\u2019t have let you starve,\u201d he says but does \nnot manage to make it sound as dismissing as he aimed for. Perhaps some \nhonesty will not hurt him this time. \u201cThen again, don\u2019t thank me yet. \nWhen\u2019s the next time you\u2019re up to cook for the team?\u201d</p><p>Steve frowns. \u201cWhy? Do you want to make sure you\u2019re \nnot home?\u201d he asks cautiously, not exactly like he thinks that Tony \nregrets wasting his past hour, but also not like he understands that \nTony has had fun.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to clear my schedule, silly.\u201d Since Steve \nis looking at him utterly dumbfounded, Tony elaborates. \u201cLet\u2019s say your \nThursday evenings are mine from now on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Steve asks.

He walks over to the cupboard to get out plates and cutlery for their always hungry group.</p><p>&ldquo;When have I ever been bad at anything?&rdquo; he asks, flippant, and grabs his suit jacket, putting it on like armour.</p><p>&ldquo;People,&rdquo; Steve answers without hesitation, but he sounds apologetic.</p><p>The thing with Steve is, Tony has resented him for \nfar longer than he has loved him, for far longer than he has known him \ntoo. There is always friction where the two of them are involved. Their \nopinions on certain topics will always differ. On the other hand, they \nsimply click. When Steve looks at him like that, Tony cannot stay put \nout.</p><p>&ldquo;I beg to differ,&rdquo; Tony drawls but does so with his \nface open again. From Steve&rsquo;s small relieved sigh, he knows it is \nunderstood that everything is well between them. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m fantastic with \npeople.&rdquo;</p><p>Fighting against a smile, Steve straightens. &ldquo;I mean, do you remember when you &ndash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Listen to that,&rdquo; Tony cuts him off, half-laughing. \nEverybody has a dozen examples of when Tony was less than able to solve a\n situation diplomatically. There is a logic to that, of course, because \nno one leaves nice people alone. No one buys weapons from a man without \nbite either. &ldquo;Captain America eats my food while he&rsquo;s trying to insult \nme.&rdquo;</p><p>This sounds dangerously close to how Howard used to say, As long as you live under my roof.\n Laughter bursts from Steve&rsquo;s lips, though, short but honest, so Tony \nrelaxes his shoulders that have instinctively straightened.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do the dishes?&rdquo; Steve offers, still smiling.</p><p>&ldquo;Not good enough,&rdquo; Tony says as he pushes a stack of \nplates into Steve&rsquo;s hands to distribute on the table. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s your part \nanyway. The cook doesn&rsquo;t have to clean.&rdquo;</p><p>Steve gets to setting the table without complaint and\n they work well together. Once everything is done, Tony asks JARVIS to \ninform the rest of the Avengers that dinner is ready. He turns toward \nthe giant pots of spaghetti and sauce, ready to begin piling food on the\n plates, when Steve stops him with a hand on his arm.</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony rolls his eyes but is secretly glad. People do \nnot often thank him. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t have let you starve,&rdquo; he says but does \nnot manage to make it sound as dismissing as he aimed for. Perhaps some \nhonesty will not hurt him this time. &ldquo;Then again, don&rsquo;t thank me yet. \nWhen&rsquo;s the next time you&rsquo;re up to cook for the team?&rdquo;</p><p>Steve frowns. &ldquo;Why? Do you want to make sure you&rsquo;re \nnot home?&rdquo; he asks cautiously, not exactly like he thinks that Tony \nregrets wasting his past hour, but also not like he understands that \nTony has had fun.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to clear my schedule, silly.&rdquo; Since Steve \nis looking at him utterly dumbfounded, Tony elaborates. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s say your \nThursday evenings are mine from now on.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Steve asks. He obviously does not get where this is going.</p><p>&ldquo;Clearly you need more lessons,&rdquo; Tony says, pointing \nat the trashcan with a mischievous grin. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to throw you out\n any time soon, but I couldn&rsquo;t live myself if you starved to death or \npoisoned yourself just because you can boil water. So lessons. On \nThursdays.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony thinks that the way Steve&rsquo;s expression brightens is a good sign. Maybe they are really going to make this team thing work.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like that,&rdquo; Steve admits quietly but the frown is not yet completely gone. &ldquo;But only if you really have time.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Of course I do.&rdquo; Tony does not. He never has, but that does not matter. &ldquo;Go ahead and pick the recipe you want to try next.&rdquo;</p>",

The Italian \nblood in his veins is shouting for murder. &ldquo;This is atrocious. I mean -&rdquo;\n Tony stops short as his eyes fall on the other pot still sitting almost\n innocently on the stove. &ldquo;Are those supposed to be spaghetti?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Tony looks around in the kitchen, at the unapologetic mess Steve has \nleft behind. Fight or flight, he thinks. He almost regrets that he has \nnever been the kind to back down.</p>\n<p>- Steve tries to poison the Avengers by making dinner.

But you weren&rsquo;t in a good mood. </p><p>You went about your day as you did every other day. There was no reason to belive something was wrong. Uncle Happy acted like always, and even when you got to school there was no one acting any different, so when you were taken to your father&rsquo;s office by a visibly shaken Pepper after school, you grew concerned. </p><p>Uncle Obie was in the Office and calmly explained to you where your father had been and what had happened to him. With every word more colour drained from your face. He didn&rsquo;t tell you the details but you figured it out yourself, you had watched the news from time to time. You weren&rsquo;t stupid.</p><p>Yet, despite what the people you love had just told you, you remained eerily quiet. Shock blocking any emotions that would normally set in, in such situations. </p><p>&ldquo;I want to go home.&rdquo; Is all you said. Flat and emotionless.</p><p>&ldquo;Alright.&rdquo; Obidiah taking your hand,\u00a0 but you didn&rsquo;t move. He just picked you up and stroked your back while bringing you to the car and buckling you in. </p><p>You noticed all the sorry glances thrown your way as you passed people in your uncle-grandpas arms. Your brain was still processing the information not ready to believe it. You hid your face in his neck.</p><p>Happy drove you home and kept an eye on you on behalf of the others since they still had to work.</p><p>The true force hit you unhindered the next day when you stayed home from school and the news came on a couple of minutes after you had turned on the TV. </p><p>Happy was still watching after you but wasn&rsquo;t in the room.</p><p>&ldquo;In further news, Tony Stark, billionaire and owner of Stark industries, went missing after an attack on the cars escorting him to another demonstration of his newest weapon in Afghanistan. Here&rsquo;s Jennifer Hendersonwith the story.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Tony Stark went missing yesterday as he was escorted to another base where he would demonstrate his newest weapon. On a barren strip of land the caravan was said to have been attacked and completely destroyed. Stark was said to have been the only one missing from the site of the attack which proved fatal to all accompanying soldiers. The chances of his survival are therefore suspected to be slim. Officials however will not give up the search either way.&rdquo; She paused and a video of your Uncle played as she voiced the news over it.</p><p>&ldquo;The official statement issued by Lieutenant James Rhodes yesterday leaves a lot of questions unanswered by the public. Though he assured the press that he will not give up the search until he finds Mr. Stark. Be it alive or dead.&rdquo; The video stopped and a picture of you and him was on screen.</p><p>&ldquo;Its a truly horrifying thing to happen especially since he is the single father of a 6 year old boy. (full/n)-Stark, last in the public eye 2 years ago when attended a press conference with his father. Is holding up as well as you&rsquo;d expect him to. He was told the news yesterday after school. According to Obidiah Stane the boy is heartbroken and was taken out of school to digest the news.&rdquo; The report ended and they cut back into the studio.</p><p>&ldquo;Poor boy.&rdquo; And with that they moved on. A report on something else followed but you didn&rsquo;t listen. You were frozen. Staring at the television like it personally had taken him away from you. </p><p>Your throat was closing up and your vision blurred while you digested the fact all over again. You didn&rsquo;t want it to be real. It shouldn&rsquo;t be real. He was supposed to come home in a few hours. He was supposed to give you one of those bear hugs and take you to the amusement park on Saturday. He was supposed to- he wasn&rsquo;t coming back. Not today, and not for a long time. Maybe not ever.</p><p>You sniffed as you hurried into your room, tears finding their way over their face while your stomach was having it&rsquo;s fun twisting itself. You crashed onto your bed and curled yourself into the big shark laying next to you.</p><p>You cried out to your dad wanting him to just come to you and take you in his arms and just keep telling you that it was all a dream, a horrible horrible dream. You cried until you fell asleep again after just waking up, you had barely noticed Happy come into your room and hold you close as you wailed, until you fell asleep in his arms. Neither did you see his sad face, you weren&rsquo;t the only one devastated by the news. Though you felt very alone.</p><p>The week home passed agonizingly slow. It was all just a blur of sadness, anger, hugs, emotion filled talks and tears. You had some times were you felt happy but then you immediately felt guilty for feeling happy. Your dad was probably not happy right now, how could you be if he wasn&rsquo;t?</p><p>You weren&rsquo;t used to so many negative emotions swirling in your mind. It was stressful and tiring, you barely had the energy to get through the day without needing a nap every few hours. These negative emotions made you physically tired more than you were ever tired. But they also made you lash out at Happy and Pepper for the first time in your life. These weren&rsquo;t nice emotions and you didn&rsquo;t want to feel them. You&rsquo;d rather feel nothing than this.</p><p>The first day back at school you were welcomed by the smiling faces of your friends. They didn&rsquo;t ask where you were and just talked to you like you never really left. </p><p>You liked that, the adults and older kids would always send you sorry glances but your friends were the same as always. </p><p>With school, the next week became easier to bear, it took your mind off of things. At night the sadness crept in but it wasn&rsquo;t a constant state of mind. Pepper had suggested writing down everything you did and felt every day so that your dad could read it when he came back and catch up on all he had missed. </p><p>You barely saw or heard from anyone besides Happy. They all seemed extremely busy, Rhodes was searching for your dad, Pepper had to deal with canceling and scheduling meetings and interviews and such, and Obie just said he was busy you didn&rsquo;t know with what.</p><p>You busied yourself when you were home carefully avoiding not doing anything. You crafted and invented both useful and useless things. Like a &ldquo;Rain maker&rdquo; for some of the plants that you had around the house, or modifying your remote controlled car to drive around the house with an alarm clock on it every day at 5 am. Why? Because it annoyed Happy and amused you. It was very funny and you recorded it for your father to see once he was back. And you strongly held onto that belief.</p><p>You also learned how to cook simple things together with Happy as you were getting sick of fast food. You ultimately both learned that you should keep the fire extinguisher closer to the oven, and how to make some good spaghetti with meatballs. At least as good as they get when an unskilled body guard and a 6 year old first time cooker make them together. It was also around that time that Happy and Pepper found out about your ability to use the force. And they seemed really happy for you. Maybe a bit shocked but happy nonetheless.</p><p>Things calmed down after a month passed and Pepper visited more frequently, Obie still seemed to be busy though. </p><p>You talked with Pepper, which you stopped calling aunt since you didn&rsquo;t feel like it fitted her anymore, about all kinds of different things. Stories about you and your family, how you scared her so much once she almost fell down the stairs, and how you both went shopping together to get your dad a birthday present without him finding out. </p><p>Pepper might have spent the least amount of time in your life than any other member of your family but she was one of the most important people in your life. A sort of mother figure from the start your older self would later realize, but for now she was just Pepper. The best person to talk about your feelings with. And the one seemingly understanding you the most. She knew just how to make you feel less alone.</p><p><b>Tags: </b><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYlu0CG6g0HV126mDX5EUAA\">@shannonr2003</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mtf05S9ZeLGz0pONCgva8gg\">@art-estrange</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYOIwa-lCaRffcCFVek9_Hg\">@nicholasbich</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mgD-QccdHC_RkLzqBEvS7oQ\">@tater-thottie</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mc7DlDWkX8lf-cxRaNqs7Ow\">@tonystanktheirondad</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m6r0Z83vxCNxu61ii2DIi6w\">@gaylemonshark</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mvpcr2B8Ixe3yKFu3BBZ-Uw\">@emilaa2001</a> </p>",

                "content": "<p><h1>Stark&rsquo;s Bug</h1><p>Tony Stark x Son!reader</p><p>This ones a bit shorter than usual but I hope y'all enjoy it all the same :)</p><p>Words: 1458</p><p><b>Chapter 7</b></p><p>You woke up the next day more groggy then usual, maybe it was the taste of unbrushed teeth in your mouth or the uncomfortable position you had managed to put yourself in after being put to bed by Happy. But you weren&rsquo;t in a good mood. </p><p>You went about your day as you did every other day. There was no reason to belive something was wrong. Uncle Happy acted like always, and even when you got to school there was no one acting any different, so when you were taken to your father&rsquo;s office by a visibly shaken Pepper after school, you grew concerned. </p><p>Uncle Obie was in the Office and calmly explained to you where your father had been and what had happened to him. With every word more colour drained from your face. He didn&rsquo;t tell you the details but you figured it out yourself, you had watched the news from time to time. You weren&rsquo;t stupid.</p><p>Yet, despite what the people you love had just told you, you remained eerily quiet. Shock blocking any emotions that would normally set in, in such situations. </p><p>&ldquo;I want to go home.&rdquo; Is all you said. Flat and emotionless.</p><p>&ldquo;Alright.&rdquo; Obidiah taking your hand,&nbsp; but you didn&rsquo;t move. He just picked you up and stroked your back while bringing you to the car and buckling you in. </p><p>You noticed all the sorry glances thrown your way as you passed people in your uncle-grandpas arms. Your brain was still processing the information not ready to believe it. You hid your face in his neck.</p><p>Happy drove you home and kept an eye on you on behalf of the others since they still had to work.</p><p>The true force hit you unhindered the next day when you stayed home from school and the news came on a couple of minutes after you had turned on the TV. </p><p>Happy was still watching after you but wasn&rsquo;t in the room.</p><p>&ldquo;In further news, Tony Stark, billionaire and owner of Stark industries, went missing after an attack on the cars escorting him to another demonstration of his newest weapon in Afghanistan. Here&rsquo;s Jennifer Hendersonwith the story.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Tony Stark went missing yesterday as he was escorted to another base where he would demonstrate his newest weapon. On a barren strip of land the caravan was said to have been attacked and completely destroyed. Stark was said to have been the only one missing from the site of the attack which proved fatal to all accompanying soldiers. The chances of his survival are therefore suspected to be slim. Officials however will not give up the search either way.&rdquo; She paused and a video of your Uncle played as she voiced the news over it.</p><p>&ldquo;The official statement issued by Lieutenant James Rhodes yesterday leaves a lot of questions unanswered by the public. Though he assured the press that he will not give up the search until he finds Mr. Stark. Be it alive or dead.&rdquo; The video stopped and a picture of you and him was on screen.</p><p>&ldquo;Its a truly horrifying thing to happen especially since he is the single father of a 6 year old boy. (full/n)-Stark, last in the public eye 2 years ago when attended a press conference with his father. Is holding up as well as you&rsquo;d expect him to. He was told the news yesterday after school. According to Obidiah Stane the boy is heartbroken and was taken out of school to digest the news.&rdquo; The report ended and they cut back into the studio.</p><p>&ldquo;Poor boy.&rdquo; And with that they moved on. A report on something else followed but you didn&rsquo;t listen. You were frozen. Staring at the television like it personally had taken him away from you. </p><p>Your throat was closing up and your vision blurred while you digested the fact all over again. You didn&rsquo;t want it to be real. It shouldn&rsquo;t be real. He was supposed to come home in a few hours. He was supposed to give you one of those bear hugs and take you to the amusement park on Saturday. He was supposed to- he wasn&rsquo;t coming back. Not today, and not for a long time. Maybe not ever.</p><p>You sniffed as you hurried into your room, tears finding their way over their face while your stomach was having it&rsquo;s fun twisting itself. You crashed onto your bed and curled yourself into the big shark laying next to you.</p><p>You cried out to your dad wanting him to just come to you and take you in his arms and just keep telling you that it was all a dream, a horrible horrible dream. You cried until you fell asleep again after just waking up, you had barely noticed Happy come into your room and hold you close as you wailed, until you fell asleep in his arms. Neither did you see his sad face, you weren&rsquo;t the only one devastated by the news. Though you felt very alone.</p><p>The week home passed agonizingly slow. It was all just a blur of sadness, anger, hugs, emotion filled talks and tears. You had some times were you felt happy but then you immediately felt guilty for feeling happy. Your dad was probably not happy right now, how could you be if he wasn&rsquo;t?</p><p>You weren&rsquo;t used to so many negative emotions swirling in your mind. It was stressful and tiring, you barely had the energy to get through the day without needing a nap every few hours. These negative emotions made you physically tired more than you were ever tired. But they also made you lash out at Happy and Pepper for the first time in your life. These weren&rsquo;t nice emotions and you didn&rsquo;t want to feel them. You&rsquo;d rather feel nothing than this.</p><p>The first day back at school you were welcomed by the smiling faces of your friends. They didn&rsquo;t ask where you were and just talked to you like you never really left. </p><p>You liked that, the adults and older kids would always send you sorry glances but your friends were the same as always. </p><p>With school, the next week became easier to bear, it took your mind off of things. At night the sadness crept in but it wasn&rsquo;t a constant state of mind. Pepper had suggested writing down everything you did and felt every day so that your dad could read it when he came back and catch up on all he had missed. </p><p>You barely saw or heard from anyone besides Happy. They all seemed extremely busy, Rhodes was searching for your dad, Pepper had to deal with canceling and scheduling meetings and interviews and such, and Obie just said he was busy you didn&rsquo;t know with what.</p><p>You busied yourself when you were home carefully avoiding not doing anything. You crafted and invented both useful and useless things. Like a &ldquo;Rain maker&rdquo; for some of the plants that you had around the house, or modifying your remote controlled car to drive around the house with an alarm clock on it every day at 5 am. Why? Because it annoyed Happy and amused you. It was very funny and you recorded it for your father to see once he was back. And you strongly held onto that belief.</p><p>You also learned how to cook simple things together with Happy as you were getting sick of fast food. You ultimately both learned that you should keep the fire extinguisher closer to the oven, and how to make some good spaghetti with meatballs. At least as good as they get when an unskilled body guard and a 6 year old first time cooker make them together. It was also around that time that Happy and Pepper found out about your ability to use the force. And they seemed really happy for you. Maybe a bit shocked but happy nonetheless.</p><p>Things calmed down after a month passed and Pepper visited more frequently, Obie still seemed to be busy though. </p><p>You talked with Pepper, which you stopped calling aunt since you didn&rsquo;t feel like it fitted her anymore, about all kinds of different things. Stories about you and your family, how you scared her so much once she almost fell down the stairs, and how you both went shopping together to get your dad a birthday present without him finding out. </p><p>Pepper might have spent the least amount of time in your life than any other member of your family but she was one of the most important people in your life. A sort of mother figure from the start your older self would later realize, but for now she was just Pepper. The best person to talk about your feelings with.
