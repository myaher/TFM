A bird in a golden cage.<br/>Their victory is written on my skin,<br/>a friendless girl in a vipers pit. I pray, but the gods<br/>seem to have forgotten me.</p><p>The crimson cloak upon my shoulders is nothing,<br/>it means nothing to me, my knees will not bend. I am ice,<br/>as hard and as lasting as the Wall.

This post is the 17th installment in this series and the last one that deals with Sansa\u2019s season 3 arc.\u00a0<br/></p><p>In this post, I\u2019m going to take a closer look at Sansa\u2019s costumes during the season with a special emphasis on her spectacular golden wedding gown since her season 3 arc revolves around her political value as Robb\u2019s heir apparent and there are several plots aimed at securing the Key to the North through marriage. It is also a costume that is inscribed with a lot of narrative and symbolic meaning that subtly enriches her story and her characterization.</p><p>Costume design is an integral aspect of the visual language of cinema and television - and especially on <i>Game of Thrones </i>since costume designer Michele Clapton approaches the costumes in terms of story-telling.</p><blockquote><p><i>I always try to <b>make the clothes visually tell something</b>.</i> (<a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.fidmmuseum.org%2Fmuseum%2F2018%2F09%2Finterview-with-game-of-thrones-costume-designer-michele-clapton.html&amp;t=NGI5YzYxY2NlMjQ3ZTFhMGJiMTRiZDY4NjkwNjBjMjdiNjZlYTQwOCx4eUJnV1ZaYg%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AYD5-STb8ovo6MvPS6P_ZLA&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Ftrinuviel.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F179909400489%2Fthe-rose-of-highgarden-on-margaery-tyrell-part&amp;m=1\">FIDM Museum Blog</a>) <br/></p><p><i>I always try to tell that story \u2014 <b>the costumes for me are narrative</b> and you should be able to look at them [the characters] and understand where they are mentally in their journey.</i> (<a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thisisinsider.com%2Fgame-of-thrones-costume-designer-michele-clapton-interview-2017-6&amp;t=NTIxNTlmMTQ5MDZmYmVlNjdjZWJhM2M0Y2VkMmQ5ZmI3NGI1NTZjMCx4eUJnV1ZaYg%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AYD5-STb8ovo6MvPS6P_ZLA&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Ftrinuviel.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F179909400489%2Fthe-rose-of-highgarden-on-margaery-tyrell-part&amp;m=1\">Insider</a>)</p><p>\n\n<i><b>I love to try and indicate the emotional state of characters through their costumes, and also to indicate their influence over other characters and courts. </b>Sometimes this says so much more than words.</i> (<a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.spin.com%2F2013%2F05%2Fgame-of-thrones-costume-designer-michele-clapton-interview-hbo%2F&amp;t=NWMzN2ExM2MzZGU4YjY5NjIzYmExOWY4MzY4NGE2ZDU3YTgxM2NiZCxqazZlM3QzTQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AYD5-STb8ovo6MvPS6P_ZLA&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Ftrinuviel.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F179869368779%2Fquotes-on-sansas-s3-wedding-dress&amp;m=1\">SPIN</a>)\n\n<br/></p></blockquote><p>Thus, the costumes are incredibly important in this show and it is worth paying attention to them because every single detail is meaningful:</p><blockquote><p>\n\n<i><b>Everything \u2013 even a fashion choice \u2013 has meaning on \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d </b>In this cutthroat world where men fight for the Iron Throne and the women yield a different kind of power, <b>a choice of fabric or a different cut of cloth can be a political statement, costume designer Michele Clapton told TODAY.com</b></i><b>.</b>(<a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.today.com%2Fstyle%2Fwhat-expect-costumes-season-3-game-thrones-1C9143460&amp;t=YTMwZTU5MjllNmQ3NTU4MjAzYzI2Y2I1NjBkZjMxYWY3YTUxNDEwOSxqazZlM3QzTQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AYD5-STb8ovo6MvPS6P_ZLA&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Ftrinuviel.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F179869368779%2Fquotes-on-sansas-s3-wedding-dress&amp;m=1\">Today</a>)\n\n<br/></p></blockquote><p>Even in real life, clothing has always had symbolic and communicative value through which people signal social and cultural positions. In short, fashion and dress codes place people within a given culture. <i>Garments function as non-verbal signs that\u00a0that can be interpreted differently depending on the context, situation or culture </i>(<a href=\"http://theministeroffashion.com/semiotics-of-fashion/\">x</a>). That is doubly so for costume design since it its entire raison d\u2019etre is to support and enrich the story that is told.</p><!-- more --><h2><b>THE SARTORIAL EVOLUTION OF SANSA STARK</b></h2><p>As said, Sansa\u2019s golden wedding dress will be the primary focus of this post - both because of its symbolic value but also because it is markedly different from the rest of her costumes during season 3. However, before I start analyzing the wedding dress it will be instructive to take a look at how she generally dresses during season 3 because the colour, cut and embellishment of the wedding dress stands in stark contrast to the rest of her costumes.</p><p>The costumes are an important part of the story-telling but they are an especially important part of Sansa\u2019s character since she\u2019s the only character that is repeatedly shown to make her own clothes! This is something that Michele Clapton emphasizes in several interviews:</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cShe expresses herself through her ability to embroider and stitch,\u201d Clapton told Buzzfeed. <b>\u201cWe\u2019ve always used that as something that Sansa expresses her feelings through\u2014her embroidery and depictions on her costumes, and through shade and color.\u201d </b></i>(<a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.looper.com%2F103763%2Fhidden-meanings-behind-costumes-game-thrones%2F&amp;t=MTkzZTdkZDU1MTg5YTY0MTM5YjFmZmQ5NGZiMjZhYmVkOTE4NDBmMyxqazZlM3QzTQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AYD5-STb8ovo6MvPS6P_ZLA&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Ftrinuviel.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F179869368779%2Fquotes-on-sansas-s3-wedding-dress&amp;m=1\">Looper</a>)</p><p><i><b>Costume is important to Sansa\u2014she sees it as a way of communicating with people, to show her aspirations.

The Starks represent a warm family unit, so the blues of their costumes are rather warm. But within the family, the various personalities are reflected in what they wear. For example, Sansa is in a slightly cooler blue.</i>\u00a0(<a href=\"http://costumevault.blogspot.com/2016/08/creating-seven-kingdoms-part-i-north.html\">CostumeVault</a>)\u00a0<br/></p></blockquote><p>\n\nInterestingly, Clapton also uses this light blue as a way to emphasize that Sansa is somewhat out of sync with the rest of her family. This becomes especially clear when the Starks line up to greet King Robert in the first episode. While the rest of the Starks are dressed in dark blues and greys, Sansa is exclusively dressed in the light baby blue - even the fur on her cloak is light blue! This makes Sansa stand out like a sore thumb among the Stark household. Considering how Clapton approaches costume design in terms of both story-telling and characterization, this choice is no coincidence.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1024\" data-orig-height=\"576\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/1ae989bb84840e764d4cf194c0f966a1/tumblr_inline_plqz3kMnvC1uklhai_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1024\" data-orig-height=\"576\"/></figure><p>She is, in a sense, a bit isolated within in her own family given how none of her siblings share her interests, not to mention that gender norms also play a role in relation to this issue (<a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/166994576194/winterfells-daughter-on-sansa-stark-part-1\">x</a>). While this isn\u2019t something that the show really delves into at the level of the text, the costuming clearly articulates a sense of isolation within the family when it comes to Sansa - and that is probably one of the reasons why she\u2019s so excited to travel to King\u2019s Landing.<br/></p><p>Sansa\u2019s costumes changes when she arrives in King\u2019s Landing. A significant costume is the lavender dress that she first wears at the Hand\u2019s Tourney. This dress represents a sartorial amalgam of the Northern and the King\u2019s Landing style. The lavender colour occupy a mid-point between Sansa\u2019s Northern blue and the dusty rose colours that the women wear at the court in King\u2019s Landing. However, the fabric is similar to her Northern dress and the embroidery not only includes her House Sigil (the Direwolf) but the leafy vines that climb the sides of the dress are rather similar to the embroidery on her Winterfell feast dress (picture at the far right in the collage below)</p><figure data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"1515\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/5472c9776e9b0e1c4e754ddffd4796db/tumblr_inline_plpk1lMVAe1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"1515\"/></figure><p>The most conspicuous detail is the neckline, which is not only significantly lower than her Northern dresses but it is also embellished with cloth roses - an completely new element in Sansa\u2019s personal iconography (<a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/167245522589/winterfells-daughter-on-sansa-stark-part-5\">x</a>).

She is completely at the mercy of the Lannisters - utterly dependent on their\u00a0\u201cmercy\u201d while she at the same time desperately tries to save her father. It is no coincidence that she\u2019s wearing her blue kimono dress when she publicly begs for her father\u2019s life and the rose kimono-dress at his public confession (that she thought would save his life) as well as later on when Joffrey forces her to look at Ned Stark\u2019s severed head.\u00a0</p><p><b><i>When</i> a costume is worn within the narrative is just as important as how it looks.</b></p><h2>Season 2</h2><p>Sansa has a fewer costumes in season 2. Whereas she had 8 different costumes in season 1, now she has 4 costumes - and two of those are repeats from the former season, which also reflects that she is no longer a privileged young noble with many new dresses. She starts the season in her two kimono dresses - this conforms to a pattern of Clapton\u2019s where she has a character wear a costume from the latter part of the previous season in the early part of the new season (<a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/179909400489/the-rose-of-highgarden-on-margaery-tyrell-part\">x</a>) This serves create narrative continuity at the visual level.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"1009\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/f44490492497822e345f756d7485e5c3/tumblr_inline_plspdxPQ3O1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"1009\"/></figure><p>This pattern also serves to express the emotional journey of the character.</p><blockquote><p>\n\n<i><b>I try to tell stories through the characters and certain characters move more in their costumes to tell their story whereas others, by not changing, tell their story.

What would she wear in this situation and how can we get here there elegantly from this situation?

These are garments that she wears in the privacy of her chambers. She may wear Southern style dress in court, but in private she wears garments that remind her of her home. The fact that she wears a garment connected to her home and her childhood in the scene where she gets her first period is also significant. The onset of menses is part of her physical maturation, she is no longer a child in the eyes of some people - and in the very next scene, she and Cersei discuss motherhood.\u00a0</p><p>After this scene, her fashion style changes dramatically. Her final costume in season 2 is radically different from the earlier ones - both in colour and in shape. Sansa debuts a dress in a deep purple patterned with wine-leaves, with long trailing sleeves and paired with a golden belt. It fits her much better than the previous kimono dresses and it closed in the front but opens at the neckline and the skirt to showcase an under-dress or a long scarf.<br/></p><figure data-orig-width=\"450\" data-orig-height=\"450\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d2ab42161e785304eb1b516b9f73609d/tumblr_inline_plsulrNIZo1uklhai_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"450\" data-orig-height=\"450\"/></figure><p>This is not the dress of a child but of a young woman.

She has also changed her hair style.</p><p>In season 1, Sansa started to adopt the intricate hairstyles made popular by Cersei Lannister - it is even directly commented on by Septa Mordane.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1000\" data-orig-height=\"700\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/101fd069ef394ed7dba97631ccff777d/tumblr_inline_plr4pcn5w11uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1000\" data-orig-height=\"700\"/></figure><p>During season 2, Sansa still wears her hair in this way when she\u2019s in public.

In the books, Sansa rejects Cersei\u2019s\u00a0\u201cwisdom\u201d internally but since we don\u2019t get that inner monologue on the screen, the it is left to the costuming to visually express this rejection rejection of Cersei\u2019s influence.</p><h2>Season 3</h2><p>In season 3, the purple dress with the wine-leaf pattern not only makes a re-appearance, it also serves as the template for the rest of Sansa\u2019s wardrobe, apart from her wedding dress, which is in a radically different style than the rest of her season 3 dresses.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"1515\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/a92d1f45d36aec8a3ab7fa2a48a03ce9/tumblr_inline_plsqgoVs3H1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"1515\"/></figure><p>Apart from her wedding dress, all of Sansa\u2019s costumes are in various shades of purple.

Whereas she wore garments in light blues, light lavender and light rose during seasons 1-2, in season 3 almost all of her dresses fall within the darker spectrum of the purple colours like dark magenta, amethyst and blue violet. <b>Clapton likes to use colour symbolically</b>:</p><blockquote><p><i>According to Clapton, color plays a pivotal role in foreshadowing characters\u2019 futures. <b>\u201cWe do all these sort of secret symbols, color hints about the ways the court is being influenced,\u201d says Clapton.</b>\u201d They are just little things that people may not notice unless they really look.\u201c We asked for examples but got no specifics. Instead Clapton hints again: \u201cYou can see the people who are getting the power by the way the court starts to dress. It\u2019s just a small thing, a color here and there and it slowly escalates. I think it\u2019s really important to do that because people tend to watch these episodes over and over again and later on box sets.

So the purple of Sansa\u2019s gowns may signal that she\u2019s influenced by very different people:</p><blockquote><p>\n\n<i><b>\u201cShe\u2019s still young and vulnerable\u2013she\u2019s always influenced by the people around her,\u201d Clapton said. </b>\u201cWithout saying too much, she befriends someone new.

In some cultures\u00a0<b>purple is associated with death, mourning and endurance of suffering</b> - and that certainly fits well with Sansa\u2019s narrative arc so far. But the colour <b>purple also has a long history as a sign of wealth, luxury and royalty!</b> The association between purple and royalty is particularly interesting in this case because season 3 includes a detail about Sansa that may foreshadow her becoming royalty, i.e. the ringing of the bells at her birth (<a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/180902951614/winterfells-daughter-on-sansa-stark-part-11\">x</a>).\u00a0Speaking of the use of colour as foreshadowing, I would be amiss not to mention the infamous Purple Wedding that takes place in season 4 and in which Sansa unwittingly plays a part by carrying a poison in the form of amethyst crystals. Incidentally, she wears purple at that feast as well.</p><p>While Sansa dresses like her mother in a visual repudiation of Cersei Lannister, her appearance is also subtly influenced by a new person in her orbit.<br/></p><figure data-orig-width=\"880\" data-orig-height=\"488\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/c0184083bb888a36a55d586af35edaee/tumblr_inline_plspih3CJF1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"880\" data-orig-height=\"488\"/></figure><p>Queen-to-be Margaery Tyrell befriends Sansa, first in order to learn what kind of person Joffrey is (<a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/181688895069/winterfells-daughter-on-sansa-stark-part-12\">x</a>) and later as part of a plot to marry Sansa to her brother Loras Tyrell in an effort to secure Sansa\u2019s claim to Winterfell for House Tyrell (<a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/181784314164/winterfells-daughter-on-sansa-stark-part-13\">x</a>).</p><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"249\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/eec3dcec611bdb5f85dc3b4814fda64f/tumblr_inline_plspq7L37m1uklhai_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"249\"/></figure><p>Thus, after Margaery has made friends with Sansa (and after the secret bethrothal has been agreed up), Sansa begins to wear her hair like her new friend.

This is, incidentally, the second time that the style of Sansa\u2019s hair is directly referred to in the show - because when it comes to Sansa, her hair styles always communicate something! Here, it subtly signals her new alliance with the Tyrells (as well as Margaery\u2019s growing influence over the royal court). Throughout the seasons, we\u2019ll see how not only Sansa\u2019s clothes but also her hair is inscribed with meaning.</p><h2><b>DRAGONFLIES, BUTTERFLIES AND MOTHS - SANSA\u2019S PERSONAL ICONOGRAPHY</b></h2><p>Michele Clapton\u2019s costume design is, as said, always narratively important - and every little detail has meaning:</p><blockquote><p>\n\n<i>\u201cPeople don\u2019t necessarily see this,\u201d admitted Clapton.

However, (unlike Cersei, Daenerys and Margaery), Sansa\u2019s personal iconography in the early seasons are not rooted in her House sigil (though the direwolf does grace one of her season 1 dresses). <b>Thus, her iconography is more about Sansa\u2019s personal journey rather than her family identity, which is also her political identity </b>- though this changes during the later seasons. <b>This reflects both Sansa\u2019s initial desire to leave her family hom</b>e, to become part of a larger world <b>but later on, it can also be seen as an expression of how her political/familial identity becomes a liability for her at Joffrey\u2019s court </b>where she is brutally punished for her brother\u2019s victories. In this context, it is noteworthy that the Stark direwolves only make a brief appearance on her clothing when she is forcibly married to Tyrion Lannister - and here, her familial/political identity is exploited by the enemies of her house.<b>The Stark direwolf only makes a definitive return in season 6 and 7 when Sansa has finally escaped her enemies and embarks upon a quest to reclaim her family seat, emerging victorious as the Lady of Winterfell.</b>\u00a0</p><h2><b>In that sense, the withholding of the Stark direwolf from her costuming is just as meaningful as Clapton\u2019s choice to withhold the Targaryen red from Daenerys\u2019 costumes until season 7 </b>(<a href=\"http://lostlittlesatellites.tumblr.com/post/179678685367/fire-and-blood\">x</a>)<b>.</b></h2><p>Sansa\u2019s personal iconography during the early seasons consists primarily of three symbols: the Dragonfly, the Butterfly and the Moth, though the Rose makes a very brief appearance in one of her season 1 dresses: the lavender Tourney dress that is very much connected with her romanticism and her love for the ideals of Chilvaric romance (I\u2019ve covered that subject <a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/167245522589/winterfells-daughter-on-sansa-stark-part-5\">here</a>). However, unlike the Rose, the Moth, the Butterfly and the Dragonfly remain consistent symbols within Sansa\u2019s personal iconography across 5 seasons.The question is: what do these animals represent in relation to Sansa\u2019s character and her narrative arc?</p><h2>The Dragonfly</h2><p>The Dragonfly is, IMO, Sansa\u2019s primary symbol during the early seasons since it is the one she wears the most.\u00a0The first time we see Sansa associated with the Dragonfly is in the second episode of season 1 where the Starks and the royal family are travelling on the King\u2019s Road towards King\u2019s Landing. Here, the dragonfly appears in the form of a delicate silver necklace.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"2788\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/79eeaeb1996d695684a2ee2c134b4afe/tumblr_inline_plpk4zabFL1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"2788\"/></figure><p>Later in season 1, the dragonfly also appears on Sansa\u2019s light blue kimono dress, which she wears when she pleads for her father\u2019s life. This dress reappears in season 2, when she wears it during her dinner with Cersei, Myrcella and Tommen (x) and in the scene where Joffrey has her publicly beaten (<a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/175216924789/winterfells-daughter-on-sansa-stark-part-7\">x</a>), along with the necklace. The dress is destroyed in that scene - but the dragonfly necklace reappears over seasons 1-3 until it is left behind in season 4.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"2788\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/41a185dba2f211ca69d919bb66b04334/tumblr_inline_plpk5lEUcW1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"2788\"/></figure><p>So what does the Dragonfly symbolise? This is where we have to be careful in our interpretations because when it comes to symbolism, multiple meanings exists, which all comes down to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragonfly#In_culture\">different cultural contexts</a>. Thus, the dragonfly is generally a positive symbol in Eastern and Native American folklore where it is associated with courage, strength, good luck and happiness. In European folklore and etymology, however, the dragonfly has more negative associations where it is associated with witchcraft as well as elves and fairies (<a href=\"http://www.crystalinks.com/dragonfly.html\">x</a>). These negative association was apparently due to its shape:</p><blockquote><p><i>\n\nThe reason why dragonflies inspire for the most part, negative myths, is believed to be due to their body shape which looks like a needle at the end (in fact, one of their nicknames is \u2018Devil\u2019s Darning Needle\u2019), their erratic flight patterns and their shimmering wings.</i> (<a href=\"https://theuijunkie.com/dragonfly-name-origin/\">x</a>)<br/></p></blockquote><p>Then there\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.ask-angels.com/spiritual-guidance/dragonfly-meaning/\">New Age philosophy</a>, which has given the dragonfly new, primarily positive and spiritual connotations like hope, change and love (<a href=\"https://dragonflytransitions.com/why-the-dragonfly/\">x</a>). What is especially interesting in the context of GRRM\u2019s story is the fact that dragonflies were also associated with dragons in Western folklore:<br/></p><blockquote><p><i>\n\nOne of the earliest reference to the name \u2018dragonfly\u2019 is on the book Sylva Sylvarum, or a Naturall Historie: In Ten Centuries (Classic Reprint) by Francis Bacon \u2013 an indeed fascinating read on ancient teachings, observations and experiments. Even though we can\u2019t be 100% sure, it\u2019s widely believed that Bacon picked up on a very common folklore name that was used at the time. And this should come as no surprise as <b>dragonflies were widely used in folklore throughout the world and it was believed that they once were dragons</b>.</i> (<a href=\"https://theuijunkie.com/dragonfly-name-origin/\">x</a>)<br/></p></blockquote><p>Within the universe that GRRM has established for his story, there is a historical character called the <a href=\"http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Duncan_Targaryen\">Prince of Dragonflies</a>, Duncan Targaryen who gave up the throne for the love. The Prince of Dragonflies and his lady love, <a href=\"http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Jenny_of_Oldstones\">Jenny of Oldstones</a>, is the subject of at least one romantic song - and in this respect the dragonfly is connected with the songs of romance that the young and innocent Sansa loves so dearly. <b>Does this mean that Sansa\u2019s dragonfly motif in the show is meant to refer to the story of the Prince of Dragonflies? </b>I honestly don\u2019t know. While Michele Clapton has read the books (<a href=\"https://latimesblogs.latimes.com/showtracker/2012/03/creative-minds-game-of-thrones-costume-designer-michele-clapton.html\">x</a>) and spoken with GRRM (<a href=\"https://www.spin.com/2013/05/game-of-thrones-costume-designer-michele-clapton-interview-hbo/\">x</a>), I haven\u2019t been able to find any quotes of hers about Sansa\u2019s dragonflies.</p><p>Since Michele Clapton hasn\u2019t spoken about her use of the dragonfly motif, it is important to be careful when ascribing it a specific symbolic meaning. However, in general, the dragonfly is most often associated with transformation since it is a <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/metamorphosis\">metamorphic</a> creature that undergoes a pupate stage before it emerges in its adult form with the beautiful iridescent wings. <b>The dragonfly as a symbol of transformation is incredibly apt when it comes to the narrative arc of Sansa Stark - she is constantly forced to adapt and change by external circumstances.</b> At the same time the fragile beauty of the adult dragonfly is also a very fitting image for Sansa\u2019s youthful beauty when she\u2019s a captive in the early seasons. <i>The dragonfly as a general symbol of transformation is also supported by the use of moths and butterflies as secondary symbols in her personal iconography.</i></p><p>If the dragonfly mainly symbolizes transformation in Sansa\u2019s personal iconography then it is no coincidence that the symbol first appear after she\u2019s left Winterfell - since this is really the point where her narrative journey starts to gain momentum. This is this very beginning of first transformation; from Northern girl to Southern lady - but that is just the first of her many transformations.</p><h2>The Moth and the Butterfly</h2><p>Moths and butterflies are secondary symbols in Sansa\u2019s personal iconography. In season 1, Sansa wears ring in what looks to be the shape of a moth, at least the ragged edges of the wings suggest a moth rather than a butterfly.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"2788\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e8b0703b2fa1952bffa1e2e1c5b97cd8/tumblr_inline_plpk3zSByP1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"2788\"/></figure><p>In season 3, a necklace with either a butterfly or a moth motif is introduced - as are set of bodice clasps that either looks like moth wings or a type of helicopter seed pods (<a href=\"https://www.bustle.com/articles/85163-sansa-starks-fashion-evolution-through-game-of-thrones-and-how-her-wardrobe-mirrors-her-character\">x)</a>.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"1632\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/670235b26228a8750094a0d9b4ee27e8/tumblr_inline_pm55vbAijg1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"1632\"/></figure><p>If these claps are meant to represent helicopter seed pods rather than moth/butterfly wings, then the question is this: are they meant to be decorative or symbolic? And if they are symbolic, what do they symbolize? In general terms, seed pods represent the continuation of the life cycle of they tree they come from - they fly away, fall to the ground where they lie dormant during winter until it is time put forth the first tendrils of a new plant when spring arrives. So in a sense, the seed pods of Sansa\u2019s claps can be said to signify growth and change just like the dragonfly.</p><p>The symbolism of both moths and butterflies varies vastly in accordance with cultural context - while there\u2019s some overlap between certain cultures, other cultures ascribe these creatures very different meanings (<a href=\"https://www.insects.orkin.com/ced/issue-4/lepidopteral-symbolism/list-1/\">x</a>, <a href=\"https://www.insects.orkin.com/ced/issue-4/lepidopteral-symbolism/list-2/\">x</a>) - not to mention the meanings that New Age philosophy ascribes to these creatures (<a href=\"http://mothsymbolism.com/\">x</a>). <b>There is NO universal symbolism of the butterfly and the moth!</b> Many of the meanings ascribed to them are culturally specific and it is important to be aware of this. I\u2019m not going to list the various symbolic meanings because there are a lot of them. Moths and butterflies belong to the same family of insects (lepidoptera). While butterflies are primarily diurnal (active during the day), moths are predominantly noctural (active at night) or crepuscular (active at twilight). Moths and butterflies sometimes have contrasting symbolic meanings and sometimes synonymous symbolic meanings, all dependent on cultural context.\u00a0</p><h2>However, in a very general sense, both moths and butterflies are symbols of transformation as they, like the dragonfly, are metamorphic creatures.\u00a0</h2><p>They are also delicate and fragile. However, just like in the case of the dragonfly, Clapton hasn\u2019t said anything about this motif - but considering that the certain parts of the symbolism of these winged creatures overlap with the dragonfly, I think it is safe to say that butterflies and moths serve the same symbolic function as the dragonfly - to signal metamorphosis and change. In this respect I agree completely with Freya Lilian Porteus:</p><blockquote><p><i>\n\nMoths, dragonflies, and butterflies are metamorphic creatures that, despite their visually flimsy allure and delicate nature, evolve and grow as they shift and change. I feel like they are a very apt metaphor for Sansa Stark, who, through her pain due to her fragile place in society as a woman, is never broken entirely. She only evolves and grows as she shifts and changes through self realization.</i> (<a href=\"https://www.bustle.com/articles/85163-sansa-starks-fashion-evolution-through-game-of-thrones-and-how-her-wardrobe-mirrors-her-character\">x</a>)<br/></p></blockquote><p>Moths especially are also creatures that employ camouflage in order to hide from predators and can thus be said to signify adaptability, which is certainly a character trait that Sansa possesses - as she tries to avoid drawing attention to herself at Joffrey\u2019s court.</p><p>Throughout the show, <b>Sansa constantly has to adapt to her circumstances.</b> She evolves continually - <b>and like a dragonfly/moth/butterfly she repeatedly emerges from one chrysalis after the other - often signaled by a radical change of style in her costume.</b> As the story progresses the stylistic changes becomes more and more marked whereas they are more subtle and gradual during the early seasons.</p><h2><b>A GILDED CAGE - SANSA\u2019S WEDDING GOWN</b></h2><p>While all the costumes are narratively important in <i>Game of Thrones</i>, some costumes carry a greater narrative weight than others, often because they are loaded with symbolic value. This is the case of Sansa\u2019s wedding dress in season 3 since this garment is meant to be a visual manifestation of the way that the Lannisters take ownership of Sansa (and her claim to Winterfell) through her forced marriage to Tyrion Lannister. When talking about this particular costume designer Michele Clapton and embroiderer Michele Carragher both repeatedly use words like\u00a0\u201ccaught\u201d,\u00a0\u201centrapment\u201d,\u00a0\u201cdomination\u201d and \u201cownership\u201d:</p><blockquote><p>\n\n<i>When Sansa is married against her will into the Lannister family, her dress shows her family\u2019s sigil, the dire wolf, losing out to the Lannister\u2019s, the lion. </i><b><i>\u201cIt\u2019s like she has been caught,\u201d explains Clapton</i>. </b>(Michele Clapton,<b>\u00a0</b><a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fastcompany.com%2F3028226%2Fdeciphering-the-hidden-messages-in-game-of-thrones-costumes&amp;t=ODAxMWRiZGUwNDQyZGVlOGI4MmM1MDdmZmMwZTc3MzlmYmI4ZmU0OSxqazZlM3QzTQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AYD5-STb8ovo6MvPS6P_ZLA&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Ftrinuviel.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F179869368779%2Fquotes-on-sansas-s3-wedding-dress&amp;m=1\">FastCompany</a>)\n\n<br/></p><p>\n\n<i>There\u2019s always a movement, particularly in Sansa, where you always see which way she\u2019s being pulled.

There\u2019s a reason for this stark difference between the costumes because <b>whereas Sansa\u2019s purple dresses signal her removal from the influence of Cersei, the wedding dress is a statement of Lannister dominance over her person and her body.</b> The embroidery plays an especially important role in this context but I\u2019ll return to that subject of the embroidery later on. First I want to take closer look on the general silhouette of the dress as well as the fabric and the colour - because these elements also carry meaning.</p><p>This dress is a sort of curious combination of the voluminous skirt and a tight sleeveless bodice, which gives the whole ensemble a slightly unbalanced look. The skirt is wider and more voluminous than what is seen on other female characters at the royal court, so this isn\u2019t a dress that conforms to the local style. The skirt looks to be supported by some kind of armature underneath, very like the panniers at the hips that were used to create width in the skirts during the rococo style of the 18th century.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"2020\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/ba3077226f29cfc38fbc485bade376a8/tumblr_inline_pm5b7n4peK1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"2020\"/></figure><p>The skirt also has a bit of a train and with the sleeveless bodice, the overall effect is of a dress that is a bit bottom-heavy. <b>The aesthetics of the gown is just slightly off and that is intentional.</b>\u00a0The lack of sleeves is an especially important detail according to the embroiderer:</p><blockquote><p>\n\n<i><b>For this dress, Michelle wanted it to be a confined, restricted bodice shape with bare, vulnerable arms. </b>She wanted an embroidered band that would wrap around the bodice and tell Sansa\u2019s life story.</i>\u00a0(Michele Carragher,\u00a0<a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwinteriscoming.net%2F2014%2F04%2F06%2Fmichele-carragher-michelle-clapton-on-the-secret-narratives-in-game-of-thrones-wardrobe%2F&amp;t=OTFlODRmN2VjOGNhMmE2MTc4YjY2YTZjMDAyMzE1YjFkODAzOTM5OCxqazZlM3QzTQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AYD5-STb8ovo6MvPS6P_ZLA&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Ftrinuviel.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F179869368779%2Fquotes-on-sansas-s3-wedding-dress&amp;m=1\">Winter Is Coming</a>)\n\n<br/></p></blockquote><p>Thus, the lack of sleeves is meant to signify vulnerability, the bodice itself tight and restrictive, trapping Sansa in her dress. The skirt itself is a bit curious in that regard - <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mK0qwUAJ3xddgqxDZTxlodQ\">@caesarscat</a> <a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/181709643144/im-not-a-fashion-expert-i-love-fashion-and-keep\">suggests</a> that it is meant to create a more womanly shape for a bride that is still a child, and that is certainly a possibility. However, the volume of the skirt and the amount of fabric used (heavy brocade) must also make this dress heavy to walk in - it physically weighs her down as an external embodiment of how this whole situation weighs so heavily on her emotions.</p><p>The skirt also sports a very curious detail that contradicts the vulnerability of the bare arms. The panniers of dress is enhanced with pieces of metal (looks like bronze) with a chased pattern of plant-like arabesques.\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"2304\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/c7fa527720d4a64d6710c8ddfadd259e/tumblr_inline_plpk9z2mDz1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"2304\"/></figure><p>This is eerily similar to Cersei\u2019s armoured dress from season 2. Cersei literally wore armour when she felt threatened and thus these pieces of metal also evoke Sansa\u2019s dictum of<i> Courtesy is a lady\u2019s armour</i>. So while the dress primarily works as a bodily trap, restricting Sansa\u2019s movements and metaphorically exposing her vulnerable position, it also contains this tiny hint of Sansa\u2019s preferred form of passive resistance: Her use of politesse as a form of emotional armour where she keeps people at arms length, refusing to let them see how she feels - a technique she uses on Tyrion in the <a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/182045002204/winterfells-daughter-on-sansa-stark-part-15\">scene</a> right before the wedding ceremony.</p><p>I\u2019ve previously pointed out how Sansa\u2019s season 3 costumes signal a remove from the Lannister influence, particularly Cersei\u2019s. The wedding dress is a conspicuous re-assertion of that influence, but now in the form of dominance rather than emulation. The deep purple colours have been replaced with a shiny, gold-accented brocade very like the fabrics used for Cersei\u2019s and Joffrey\u2019s costumes.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"2020\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/5017cb44691438263be4069a938297cd/tumblr_inline_plsuar1XCy1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"2020\"/></figure><p>The fastening of the bodice has also reverted to the side-flap that characterized her kimono dresses, which were emulating Cersei\u2019s season 1 look.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"1088\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/aba6f39bbb4e75b25d59f727d6c96d42/tumblr_inline_plsubdYC6t1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"1088\"/></figure><p>At the same time, the wedding dress contains a very subtle callback to Sansa\u2019s Tourney dress from season one since the base colour of the gold-accented brocade is a pale lavender very similar to the season 1 dress. In a way, the use of the lavender colour is a cruel appropriation of this romantic dress (which incidentally also sports an embroidered direwolf like the wedding dress). The Tourney dress represent Sansa\u2019s romanticism and her love of Chivalric Romance (<a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/167245522589/winterfells-daughter-on-sansa-stark-part-5\">x</a>) - but now that romanticism has been put into a golden Lannister cage where marriage is not a union of lovers but a cynic power move against her family.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"3187\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/512df38cef63fa5384b85c2c61954a44/tumblr_inline_plpk7cy2fZ1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"3187\"/></figure><p>Another thing I noticed upon my re-watch of the wedding scene is how Sansa\u2019s dress visually matches Joffrey\u2019s opulent costume in terms of both colour and fabric. I\u2019ve <a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/179909400489/the-rose-of-highgarden-on-margaery-tyrell-part\">previously written</a> about how matching clothes can be used to convey political and familial unity in the case of the Tyrells. In this case, however, the visual match between Sansa\u2019s and Joffrey\u2019s costumes signals domination rather than unity.\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"1352\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/dd756141668ca9bfdbac5291b1c54cb8/tumblr_inline_plsucgu0AU1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"1352\"/></figure><p>In this context, the way that Sansa\u2019s and Tyrion\u2019s costumes don\u2019t match is also meaningful. While Sansa is wearing gold-and-lavender brocade, Tyrion is wearing a tunic in oxblood leather. They clash visually, standing next to each other at the altar. However, after Sansa has been garbed in the red-gold Lannister bridal cloak, the dark red accent of the cloak suddenly makes her costume match Tyrion\u2019s. Once again, this is not a visual statement of unity but rather of domination. With the cloaking of the bride, Tyrion (and through him House Lannister) takes possession of Sansa. She is now their property, bound to them permanently through the bonds of matrimony.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1982\" data-orig-height=\"724\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b038f639170cbf98e71cf7a112f7ce7b/tumblr_inline_plpkqcrdwL1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1982\" data-orig-height=\"724\"/></figure><p>Sansa\u2019s wedding costume also includes another element that harks back to her earlier romantic self - the lion medallion that Joffrey gave her as a love token in season 1 (he was insincere but to Sansa it was a gesture straight out of the chivalric romances she loved so much). Now this symbol of romantic love has been subverted into yet another message of domination, of ownership.</p><h2>Embroidery</h2><p>As we can see, the shape, the fabric and the colour of a costume can carry a lot of meaning. However, Clapton adds yet another narrative layer in the form of an embroidered band that wraps around the bodice and acts as a symbolic cage in the same manner that the dress itself functions as a material cage that envelops and restricts Sansa\u2019s body. Clapton uses embroidery extensively in her costume design as a narrative element:</p><blockquote><p>\n\n<i>\u201c<b>The embroidery is a subliminal way to tell someone\u2019s story</b>,\u201d says Michele Clapton</i> (<a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hollywoodreporter.com%2Fnews%2Fgame-thrones-costume-designers-reveal-705873&amp;t=ZjA0NGY0NWQ5MzQ4OGVlMjg5NWI3ZTUxOTY4ZjI3Mzc3ZmFmNTA3MyxqazZlM3QzTQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AYD5-STb8ovo6MvPS6P_ZLA&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Ftrinuviel.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F179869368779%2Fquotes-on-sansas-s3-wedding-dress&amp;m=1\">Hollywood Reporter</a>)\n\n<br/></p></blockquote><p>When it comes to the embroidery Clapton co-operates with the embroiderer Michele Carragher, who creates countless beaded embellishments for the costumes of the show. In the case of Sansa\u2019s wedding dress, Clapton and Carragher designed a piece of embroidery that uses the heraldry of several noble Houses to tell the story of Sansa\u2019s parentage and her subsequent entrapment by the Lannisters.\u00a0Thus, the entire piece makes up a story in itself, written across the body of an unwilling child-bride.\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>\n\n<i>\u201c<b>Obviously we imagined that the wedding dress has been commissioned by Cersei and the Lannisters for Sansa, and so the embroidery would have come from Cersei\u2019s mind.</b> We guessed that it wouldn\u2019t be romantic or lovely and girly and pretty with dainty flowers, but <b>a real strong message of dominance, saying that we own you now, Sansa.</b></i>\u00a0(Carragher,\u00a0<a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwinteriscoming.net%2F2014%2F04%2F06%2Fmichele-carragher-michelle-clapton-on-the-secret-narratives-in-game-of-thrones-wardrobe%2F&amp;t=OTFlODRmN2VjOGNhMmE2MTc4YjY2YTZjMDAyMzE1YjFkODAzOTM5OCxqazZlM3QzTQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AYD5-STb8ovo6MvPS6P_ZLA&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Ftrinuviel.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F179869368779%2Fquotes-on-sansas-s3-wedding-dress&amp;m=1\">Winter Is Coming</a>)\n\n<br/></p></blockquote><p>The story starts at the back of the band with a symbolic representation of Sansa\u2019s parentage:</p><blockquote><p>\n\n<i>\u201cFor the wedding band, I started at the back of the waist with some <b>Stark direwolves and Tully fish entwined</b> that represent Sansa\u2019s parentage.\u201d\u00a0\n\n</i>(Carragher, <a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwinteriscoming.net%2F2014%2F04%2F06%2Fmichele-carragher-michelle-clapton-on-the-secret-narratives-in-game-of-thrones-wardrobe%2F&amp;t=OTFlODRmN2VjOGNhMmE2MTc4YjY2YTZjMDAyMzE1YjFkODAzOTM5OCxqazZlM3QzTQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AYD5-STb8ovo6MvPS6P_ZLA&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Ftrinuviel.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F179869368779%2Fquotes-on-sansas-s3-wedding-dress&amp;m=1\">Winter Is Coming</a>) \n\n<br/></p></blockquote><figure data-orig-width=\"750\" data-orig-height=\"600\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/ffdc1a2fc2579860ad7fc060a2862c20/tumblr_inline_plpki2dkLB1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"750\" data-orig-height=\"600\"/></figure><p>The band cross over itself on the front of the bodice where Carragher added the Lannister lion to the unfolding narrative:</p><blockquote><p>\n\n<i>\u201cThen, as we move to the side, <b>the Lannister lion is tangling with the direwolf and emerging on top</b>, representing Sansa being seduced and then controlled by members of the house of Lannister.

The oldest depiction of the pomegranate in the arts date was found in the city of Uruk in ancient Sumer and dates back more than 5,000 years (<a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/archaeology/.premium.MAGAZINE-before-judaism-the-8-000-year-old-history-of-pomegranate-reverence-1.6461970\">x</a>). It was connected to the cult of<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inanna\"> Ishtar</a>/Innana, goddess of love, sex, fertility.</p><p>Throughout the Mediterranean, Near Eastern and Middle Eastern world, <b>the pomegranate</b> has been revered as <b>an ancient and potent symbol of fertility, regeneration and marriage</b>:</p><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;People use whatever is at hand to express their religious beliefs,&quot;says Frank A. Salamone, an authority on religious symbols and a professor at Iona College in New Rochelle, N.Y. Centuries ago, in the Fertile Crescent, where so many religions arose, the pomegranate was at hand. By its very nature, it lent itself to religious symbolism.<br/></i></p><p><i>&quot;The pomegranate is red, and so is blood,&rdquo; Salamone says. &ldquo;It has a lot of seeds and is an obvious symbol of fertility.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s beautiful, strong and delicate, and its juice has healing properties, he says. &ldquo;It says a lot of different things all at once. People bring meaning to it.&rdquo;</i> (<a href=\"https://www.beliefnet.com/news/2005/11/a-pomegranate-for-all-religions.aspx\">Prof. Frank A. Salamone</a>)<br/></p></blockquote><p>The pomegranate tree is considered to have <a href=\"https://itsallgreeklondon.wordpress.com/2014/10/29/the-significance-of-the-pomegranate-in-ancient-greece/\">originated</a> in the in Persia (Iran) and its connection with notions of fertility is intimately connected with the advent and spread of agriculture. It\u2019s status as a symbol of fertility was most likely transmitted through a kind of cross-cultural pollination along with the tree as it was exported East to China and West to Egypt, Turkey, North Africa, Greece and Rome.</p><p>While it is a fertility symbol in many cultures, the fruit also became associated with Death and Resurrection in Greek and Roman mythology. Most famously in the <a href=\"http://itsallgreeklondon.wordpress.com/2014/10/29/the-significance-of-the-pomegranate-in-ancient-greece/\">myth of Persephone</a>, daughter of the fertility goddess Demeter. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persephone\">Persephone</a> was a vegetation goddess like Demeter but according to myth she was abducted by Hades, the God of the Underworld. Demeter went into mourning and all plant life died so Zeus commanded Hades to release her daughter. However, Hades had tricked Persephone into eating six pomegranate seeds and so she was forced to spend six months of the year as Queen of the Underworld and the remaining six months above ground as a goddess of spring. The myth of Persephone is essentially an allegorical retelling of the changing of the seasons - and thus <b>the pomegranate is not just connected to fertility</b> (spring) <b>but also</b> <b>to death</b> (winter) <b>and resurrection</b> (the re-emergence of spring).</p><p>However, the pomegranate as a symbol of death and resurrection is also connected to another mythical figure: Adonis, the lover of Venus, the Roman goddess of love and sex. In the <i>Metamorphoses</i>, the Roman poet Ovid recounts the tale of Adonis who is slain on a hunt and the grief-stricken Venus creates the anemone flower, red like a pomegranate in memory of him:</p><blockquote><p><i>When from the heights she saw the lifeless body lying in its own blood, she leapt down, tearing her clothes, and tearing at her hair as well, and beat at her breasts with fierce hands, complaining to the fates. \u201cAnd yet not everything is in your power\u201d she said. \u201cAdonis, there shall be an everlasting token of my grief, and every year an imitation of your death will complete a re-enactment of my mourning. <b>But your blood will be changed into a flower</b>\u2026\u201d So saying, she sprinkled the blood with odorous nectar: and, at the touch, it swelled up, as bubbles emerge in yellow mud. <b>In less than an hour, a flower, of the colour of blood, was created such as pomegranates carry, that hide their seeds under a tough rind.</b> But enjoyment of it is brief: for, lightly clinging, and too easily fallen, the winds deflower it, which are likewise responsible for its name, windflower: anemone</i>\u2019 (<a href=\"http://ovidsmetamorphoses.blogspot.com/2012/08/an-anemone-for-adonis.html\">Source</a>)</p></blockquote><p>According to myth, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adonis\">Adonis</a> was raised by Persephone in the Underworld - but the figure has much older roots in the Sumerian story of Innana and Dumuzid. Adonis is thus very likely connected to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dying-and-rising_deity\">Dying-and-Rising archetype</a>, which characterizes a number of male fertility gods in the Middle Eastern and Mediterranean region of during Antiquity.</p><p>Christianity also appropriated the symbolism of Fertility and Resurrection associated with the pomegranate into its iconography:</p><blockquote><p><i><b>\n\nIn Christian art the pomegranate</b>, often split\nand showing the seeds, <b>was interpreted as a\nsymbol of fertility, hope of immortality, and\nthe Resurrection</b>. The infant Jesus is frequently seen in paintings and sculpture presenting\nthe pomegranate to his mother. In the last of\nthe famous Unicorn tapestries at The Cloisters the symbolic meaning of marriage and fertility is illustrated by showing the Unicorn\nchained to the pomegranate tree, with the red\nseeds of a bursting fruit spilling on him.</i> (<a href=\"https://www.metmuseum.org/pubs/bulletins/1/pdf/3257268.pdf.bannered.pdf\">Hildegard Schneider</a>)<br/></p></blockquote><p>So the pomegranates on Sansa\u2019s wedding dress has a very old and rich symbolic history - and <b>the connection between the pomegranate and fertility is very apt in this context since the Lannisters intend for Sansa to bear fruit in her marriage in the form of a Lannister-Stark child</b> through which they can claim the North.</p><p>Even more interesting is the fact that Sansa has her very own pomegranate symbolism in GRRM\u2019s text. After Petyr Baelish spirits Sansa away to the Fingers, he offers her pomegranates and other fruits during a private conversation where he\u2019s imparting his particular brand of wisdom:</p><blockquote><p><i>\n\nGrisel reappeared before he could say more, balancing a large platter. She set it down between them. There were apples and pears and pomegranates, some sad-looking grapes, a huge blood orange. The old woman had brought a round of bread as well, and a crock of butter. <b>Petyr cut a pomegranate in two with his dagger, offering half to Sansa.</b> &ldquo;You should try and eat, my lady.&rdquo; &ldquo;Thank you, my lord.&rdquo; <b>Pomegranate seeds were so messy; Sansa chose a pear instead</b>, and took a small delicate bite. It was very ripe. The juice ran down her chin.</i></p><p><i>&hellip;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;In King&rsquo;s Landing, there are two sorts of people. The players and the pieces.&rdquo;\n\n<br/></i></p><p><i>\n\n&ldquo;And I was a piece?&rdquo; She dreaded the answer.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Yes, but don&rsquo;t let that trouble you. You&rsquo;re still half a child. Every man&rsquo;s a piece to start with, and every maid as well. Even some who think they are players.&rdquo; He ate another seed. &ldquo;Cersei, for one. She thinks herself sly, but in truth she is utterly predictable. Her strength rests on her beauty, birth, and riches. Only the first of those is truly her own, and it will soon desert her. I pity her then. She wants power, but has no notion what to do with it when she gets it. <b>Everyone wants something, Alayne. And when you know what a man wants you know who he is, and how to move him</b>.&quot;\u00a0</i></p><p><i>&hellip;</i></p><p><i><b>\n\nLord Petyr</b> dismissed him with a wave, and <b>returned to the pomegranate again</b> as Oswell shuffled down the steps. &rdquo;<b>Tell me, Alayne\u2014which is more dangerous, the dagger brandished by an enemy, or the hidden one</b> pressed to your back by someone you never even see?&ldquo;</i></p><p><i>&quot;The hidden dagger.&rdquo;</i>\u00a0(ASoS, Sansa VI)\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>Baelish then starts to eat a blood orange as he continues to talk, steadily guiding Sansa through his machinations until she realizes that it was Olenna Tyrell who poisoned Joffrey:</p><blockquote><p><i>\n\nHe tilted his chin back and squeezed the blood orange, so the juice ran down into his mouth. &ldquo;I love the juice but I loathe the sticky fingers,&rdquo; he complained, wiping his hands. &ldquo;<b>Clean</b> <b>hands, Sansa. Whatever you do, make certain your hands are clean.</b>&rdquo;</i> (ASoS, Sansa VI)<br/></p></blockquote><p>The conversation goes on as Baelish relates exactly how he manipulated the Tyrells into doing what he wanted.</p><p>This is not just a conversation over fruit where Baelish instructs his new pupil in the subtleties of the game of thrones. <b>It is a temptation scenario where he offers Sansa a fruit associated with temptation as he intends to mold her into his own image. </b>Like Hades, Baelish<b>\u00a0</b>tempts Sansa with the pomegranate but unlike Persephone, Sansa refuses the fruit.\u00a0</p><h2>Sansa REFUSES the pomegranate! This is very important because it foreshadows her eventually rejecting Baelish and his nefarious ambitions.</h2><p>This temptation scenario is lent even more symbolic weight if we consider the hypothesis that the Forbidden Fruit in the Garden of Eden might not have been an apple but a pomegranate! (<a href=\"https://iranian.com/2009/05/04/it-was-a-pomegranate-not-an-apple-depicted-in-the-biblical-garden-of-eden-part-i/\">x</a>) This interpretation is still somewhat controversial but if the Forbidden Fruit was indeed a pomegranate then the Temptation of Eve does have an interesting parallel with the Temptation of Persephone.</p><p>I have been unable to find any confirmation that the pomegranates on Sansa\u2019s wedding dress are meant to have a deeper meaning than an association to the Lannister red. However, Carragher develops her creations in collaboration with Clapton and she does quite a bit of historical research:</p><blockquote><p><i>\n\nFor \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d Carragher often spends as long thinking about a piece as she does making it. <b>First, she confers with Clapton about each character\u2019s narrative arc </b>and the costumes Clapton has designed for them. <b>Then Carragher does historical research</b> in museums near her home, in East London. After a month of planning, she ships her materials to the show\u2019s Belfast production studios, where she works six days a week, twelve hours a day, embellishing a season\u2019s worth of costumes.</i> (<a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/embroidering-game-of-thrones\">The NewYorker</a>)<br/></p></blockquote><h2>Thus, it is not implausible that adorning a wedding dress with\u00a0an age old symbol of fertility and marriage is not entirely coincidental on the part of the designers!</h2>",

However, before I start analyzing the wedding dress it will be instructive to take a look at how she generally dresses during season 3 because the colour, cut and embellishment of the wedding dress stands in stark contrast to the rest of her costumes.</p><p>The costumes are an important part of the story-telling but they are an especially important part of Sansa\u2019s character since she\u2019s the only character that is repeatedly shown to make her own clothes! This is something that Michele Clapton emphasizes in several interviews:</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cShe expresses herself through her ability to embroider and stitch,\u201d Clapton told Buzzfeed. <b>\u201cWe\u2019ve always used that as something that Sansa expresses her feelings through\u2014her embroidery and depictions on her costumes, and through shade and color.\u201d </b></i>(<a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.looper.com%2F103763%2Fhidden-meanings-behind-costumes-game-thrones%2F&amp;t=MTkzZTdkZDU1MTg5YTY0MTM5YjFmZmQ5NGZiMjZhYmVkOTE4NDBmMyxqazZlM3QzTQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AYD5-STb8ovo6MvPS6P_ZLA&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Ftrinuviel.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F179869368779%2Fquotes-on-sansas-s3-wedding-dress&amp;m=1\">Looper</a>)</p><p><i><b>Costume is important to Sansa\u2014she sees it as a way of communicating with people, to show her aspirations.

The Starks represent a warm family unit, so the blues of their costumes are rather warm. But within the family, the various personalities are reflected in what they wear. For example, Sansa is in a slightly cooler blue.</i>\u00a0(<a href=\"http://costumevault.blogspot.com/2016/08/creating-seven-kingdoms-part-i-north.html\">CostumeVault</a>)\u00a0<br></p></blockquote><p>\n\nInterestingly, Clapton also uses this light blue as a way to emphasize that Sansa is somewhat out of sync with the rest of her family. This becomes especially clear when the Starks line up to greet King Robert in the first episode. While the rest of the Starks are dressed in dark blues and greys, Sansa is exclusively dressed in the light baby blue - even the fur on her cloak is light blue! This makes Sansa stand out like a sore thumb among the Stark household. Considering how Clapton approaches costume design in terms of both story-telling and characterization, this choice is no coincidence.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1024\" data-orig-height=\"576\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/1ae989bb84840e764d4cf194c0f966a1/tumblr_inline_plqz3kMnvC1uklhai_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1024\" data-orig-height=\"576\"></figure><p>She is, in a sense, a bit isolated within in her own family given how none of her siblings share her interests, not to mention that gender norms also play a role in relation to this issue (<a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/166994576194/winterfells-daughter-on-sansa-stark-part-1\">x</a>). While this isn\u2019t something that the show really delves into at the level of the text, the costuming clearly articulates a sense of isolation within the family when it comes to Sansa - and that is probably one of the reasons why she\u2019s so excited to travel to King\u2019s Landing.<br></p><p>Sansa\u2019s costumes changes when she arrives in King\u2019s Landing. A significant costume is the lavender dress that she first wears at the Hand\u2019s Tourney. This dress represents a sartorial amalgam of the Northern and the King\u2019s Landing style. The lavender colour occupy a mid-point between Sansa\u2019s Northern blue and the dusty rose colours that the women wear at the court in King\u2019s Landing. However, the fabric is similar to her Northern dress and the embroidery not only includes her House Sigil (the Direwolf) but the leafy vines that climb the sides of the dress are rather similar to the embroidery on her Winterfell feast dress (picture at the far right in the collage below)</p><figure data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"1515\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/5472c9776e9b0e1c4e754ddffd4796db/tumblr_inline_plpk1lMVAe1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"1515\"></figure><p>The most conspicuous detail is the neckline, which is not only significantly lower than her Northern dresses but it is also embellished with cloth roses - an completely new element in Sansa\u2019s personal iconography (<a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/167245522589/winterfells-daughter-on-sansa-stark-part-5\">x</a>). This dress also marks the beginning of Sansa\u2019s slow transition from a child to a young girl at the cusp of maidenhood.</p><p>Later in the season, Sansa\u2019s Northern dresses are completely discarded - and she is now dressed in the kimono-style of light-weight fabric like the ones that Cersei wears.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"1515\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/f8c9de4d607ca3c3e520a6742b3297f2/tumblr_inline_plpiduhHqw1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"1515\"></figure><p>However, it is also important to note that she only starts wearing these Cersei-inspired costumes after she has fallen completely within the power of the Lannisters.</p><blockquote><p>\n\n<i>Where a character comes from is indicated through the color and cut of the costume.<b> </b>When we first see Sansa [Sophie Turner], she wears things in a Stark way \u2014 very well, but they are slightly clumsy and the cloth is rather homespun. As she comes to King\u2019s Landing, her progression is influenced by Cersei [Lena Headey] and her costumes shift. <b>After Cersei does the awful thing of sanctioning the death of Ned Stark [Sansa\u2019s father], Sansa is stuck \u2014 you can see her frozen in time. She\u2019s looking like someone who has just killed her father.

She is completely at the mercy of the Lannisters - utterly dependent on their\u00a0\u201cmercy\u201d while she at the same time desperately tries to save her father. It is no coincidence that she\u2019s wearing her blue kimono dress when she publicly begs for her father\u2019s life and the rose kimono-dress at his public confession (that she thought would save his life) as well as later on when Joffrey forces her to look at Ned Stark\u2019s severed head.\u00a0</p><p><b><i>When</i> a costume is worn within the narrative is just as important as how it looks.</b></p><h2>Season 2</h2><p>Sansa has a fewer costumes in season 2. Whereas she had 8 different costumes in season 1, now she has 4 costumes - and two of those are repeats from the former season, which also reflects that she is no longer a privileged young noble with many new dresses. She starts the season in her two kimono dresses - this conforms to a pattern of Clapton\u2019s where she has a character wear a costume from the latter part of the previous season in the early part of the new season (<a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/179909400489/the-rose-of-highgarden-on-margaery-tyrell-part\">x</a>) This serves create narrative continuity at the visual level.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"1009\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/f44490492497822e345f756d7485e5c3/tumblr_inline_plspdxPQ3O1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"1009\"></figure><p>This pattern also serves to express the emotional journey of the character.</p><blockquote><p>\n\n<i><b>I try to tell stories through the characters and certain characters move more in their costumes to tell their story whereas others, by not changing, tell their story.

These are garments that she wears in the privacy of her chambers. She may wear Southern style dress in court, but in private she wears garments that remind her of her home. The fact that she wears a garment connected to her home and her childhood in the scene where she gets her first period is also significant. The onset of menses is part of her physical maturation, she is no longer a child in the eyes of some people - and in the very next scene, she and Cersei discuss motherhood.\u00a0</p><p>After this scene, her fashion style changes dramatically. Her final costume in season 2 is radically different from the earlier ones - both in colour and in shape. Sansa debuts a dress in a deep purple patterned with wine-leaves, with long trailing sleeves and paired with a golden belt. It fits her much better than the previous kimono dresses and it closed in the front but opens at the neckline and the skirt to showcase an under-dress or a long scarf.<br></p><figure data-orig-width=\"450\" data-orig-height=\"450\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d2ab42161e785304eb1b516b9f73609d/tumblr_inline_plsulrNIZo1uklhai_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"450\" data-orig-height=\"450\"></figure><p>This is not the dress of a child but of a young woman.

She has also changed her hair style.</p><p>In season 1, Sansa started to adopt the intricate hairstyles made popular by Cersei Lannister - it is even directly commented on by Septa Mordane.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1000\" data-orig-height=\"700\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/101fd069ef394ed7dba97631ccff777d/tumblr_inline_plr4pcn5w11uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1000\" data-orig-height=\"700\"></figure><p>During season 2, Sansa still wears her hair in this way when she\u2019s in public.

In the books, Sansa rejects Cersei\u2019s\u00a0\u201cwisdom\u201d internally but since we don\u2019t get that inner monologue on the screen, the it is left to the costuming to visually express this rejection rejection of Cersei\u2019s influence.</p><h2>Season 3</h2><p>In season 3, the purple dress with the wine-leaf pattern not only makes a re-appearance, it also serves as the template for the rest of Sansa\u2019s wardrobe, apart from her wedding dress, which is in a radically different style than the rest of her season 3 dresses.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"1515\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/a92d1f45d36aec8a3ab7fa2a48a03ce9/tumblr_inline_plsqgoVs3H1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"1515\"></figure><p>Apart from her wedding dress, all of Sansa\u2019s costumes are in various shades of purple.

Whereas she wore garments in light blues, light lavender and light rose during seasons 1-2, in season 3 almost all of her dresses fall within the darker spectrum of the purple colours like dark magenta, amethyst and blue violet. <b>Clapton likes to use colour symbolically</b>:</p><blockquote><p><i>According to Clapton, color plays a pivotal role in foreshadowing characters\u2019 futures. <b>\u201cWe do all these sort of secret symbols, color hints about the ways the court is being influenced,\u201d says Clapton.</b>\u201d They are just little things that people may not notice unless they really look.\u201c We asked for examples but got no specifics. Instead Clapton hints again: \u201cYou can see the people who are getting the power by the way the court starts to dress. It\u2019s just a small thing, a color here and there and it slowly escalates. I think it\u2019s really important to do that because people tend to watch these episodes over and over again and later on box sets.

So the purple of Sansa\u2019s gowns may signal that she\u2019s influenced by very different people:</p><blockquote><p>\n\n<i><b>\u201cShe\u2019s still young and vulnerable\u2013she\u2019s always influenced by the people around her,\u201d Clapton said. </b>\u201cWithout saying too much, she befriends someone new.

In some cultures\u00a0<b>purple is associated with death, mourning and endurance of suffering</b> - and that certainly fits well with Sansa\u2019s narrative arc so far. But the colour <b>purple also has a long history as a sign of wealth, luxury and royalty!</b> The association between purple and royalty is particularly interesting in this case because season 3 includes a detail about Sansa that may foreshadow her becoming royalty, i.e. the ringing of the bells at her birth (<a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/180902951614/winterfells-daughter-on-sansa-stark-part-11\">x</a>).\u00a0Speaking of the use of colour as foreshadowing, I would be amiss not to mention the infamous Purple Wedding that takes place in season 4 and in which Sansa unwittingly plays a part by carrying a poison in the form of amethyst crystals. Incidentally, she wears purple at that feast as well.</p><p>While Sansa dresses like her mother in a visual repudiation of Cersei Lannister, her appearance is also subtly influenced by a new person in her orbit.<br></p><figure data-orig-width=\"880\" data-orig-height=\"488\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/c0184083bb888a36a55d586af35edaee/tumblr_inline_plspih3CJF1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"880\" data-orig-height=\"488\"></figure><p>Queen-to-be Margaery Tyrell befriends Sansa, first in order to learn what kind of person Joffrey is (<a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/181688895069/winterfells-daughter-on-sansa-stark-part-12\">x</a>) and later as part of a plot to marry Sansa to her brother Loras Tyrell in an effort to secure Sansa\u2019s claim to Winterfell for House Tyrell (<a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/181784314164/winterfells-daughter-on-sansa-stark-part-13\">x</a>).</p><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"249\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/eec3dcec611bdb5f85dc3b4814fda64f/tumblr_inline_plspq7L37m1uklhai_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"249\"></figure><p>Thus, after Margaery has made friends with Sansa (and after the secret bethrothal has been agreed up), Sansa begins to wear her hair like her new friend. Petyr Baelish notices this and comments upon it when Sansa politely rejects his offer to spirit her away from the capital. This is, incidentally, the second time that the style of Sansa\u2019s hair is directly referred to in the show - because when it comes to Sansa, her hair styles always communicate something! Here, it subtly signals her new alliance with the Tyrells (as well as Margaery\u2019s growing influence over the royal court). Throughout the seasons, we\u2019ll see how not only Sansa\u2019s clothes but also her hair is inscribed with meaning.</p><h2><b>DRAGONFLIES, BUTTERFLIES AND MOTHS - SANSA\u2019S PERSONAL ICONOGRAPHY</b></h2><p>Michele Clapton\u2019s costume design is, as said, always narratively important - and every little detail has meaning:</p><blockquote><p>\n\n<i>\u201cPeople don\u2019t necessarily see this,\u201d admitted Clapton.

Clapton almost always uses jewellery and embroidery symbolically - the most obvious examples being Cersei\u2019s lion embossed necklaces and lion embroidered gowns to Daenerys\u2019 dragon jewels and scaly embellishments and <a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/179909400489/the-rose-of-highgarden-on-margaery-tyrell-part\">Margaery\u2019s delicate roses</a>.\u00a0</p><p>Sansa also has her own personal iconography, which is expressed through the embroidery on her clothes and the jewellery she wears. However, (unlike Cersei, Daenerys and Margaery), Sansa\u2019s personal iconography in the early seasons are not rooted in her House sigil (though the direwolf does grace one of her season 1 dresses). <b>Thus, her iconography is more about Sansa\u2019s personal journey rather than her family identity, which is also her political identity </b>- though this changes during the later seasons. <b>This reflects both Sansa\u2019s initial desire to leave her family hom</b>e, to become part of a larger world <b>but later on, it can also be seen as an expression of how her political/familial identity becomes a liability for her at Joffrey\u2019s court </b>where she is brutally punished for her brother\u2019s victories. In this context, it is noteworthy that the Stark direwolves only make a brief appearance on her clothing when she is forcibly married to Tyrion Lannister - and here, her familial/political identity is exploited by the enemies of her house.<b>The Stark direwolf only makes a definitive return in season 6 and 7 when Sansa has finally escaped her enemies and embarks upon a quest to reclaim her family seat, emerging victorious as the Lady of Winterfell.</b>\u00a0</p><h2><b>In that sense, the withholding of the Stark direwolf from her costuming is just as meaningful as Clapton\u2019s choice to withhold the Targaryen red from Daenerys\u2019 costumes until season 7 </b>(<a href=\"http://lostlittlesatellites.tumblr.com/post/179678685367/fire-and-blood\">x</a>)<b>.</b></h2><p>Sansa\u2019s personal iconography during the early seasons consists primarily of three symbols: the Dragonfly, the Butterfly and the Moth, though the Rose makes a very brief appearance in one of her season 1 dresses: the lavender Tourney dress that is very much connected with her romanticism and her love for the ideals of Chilvaric romance (I\u2019ve covered that subject <a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/167245522589/winterfells-daughter-on-sansa-stark-part-5\">here</a>). However, unlike the Rose, the Moth, the Butterfly and the Dragonfly remain consistent symbols within Sansa\u2019s personal iconography across 5 seasons.The question is: what do these animals represent in relation to Sansa\u2019s character and her narrative arc?</p><h2>The Dragonfly</h2><p>The Dragonfly is, IMO, Sansa\u2019s primary symbol during the early seasons since it is the one she wears the most.\u00a0The first time we see Sansa associated with the Dragonfly is in the second episode of season 1 where the Starks and the royal family are travelling on the King\u2019s Road towards King\u2019s Landing. Here, the dragonfly appears in the form of a delicate silver necklace.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"2788\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/79eeaeb1996d695684a2ee2c134b4afe/tumblr_inline_plpk4zabFL1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"2788\"></figure><p>Later in season 1, the dragonfly also appears on Sansa\u2019s light blue kimono dress, which she wears when she pleads for her father\u2019s life.

This is where we have to be careful in our interpretations because when it comes to symbolism, multiple meanings exists, which all comes down to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragonfly#In_culture\">different cultural contexts</a>. Thus, the dragonfly is generally a positive symbol in Eastern and Native American folklore where it is associated with courage, strength, good luck and happiness. In European folklore and etymology, however, the dragonfly has more negative associations where it is associated with witchcraft as well as elves and fairies (<a href=\"http://www.crystalinks.com/dragonfly.html\">x</a>). These negative association was apparently due to its shape:</p><blockquote><p><i>\n\nThe reason why dragonflies inspire for the most part, negative myths, is believed to be due to their body shape which looks like a needle at the end (in fact, one of their nicknames is \u2018Devil\u2019s Darning Needle\u2019), their erratic flight patterns and their shimmering wings.</i> (<a href=\"https://theuijunkie.com/dragonfly-name-origin/\">x</a>)<br></p></blockquote><p>Then there\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.ask-angels.com/spiritual-guidance/dragonfly-meaning/\">New Age philosophy</a>, which has given the dragonfly new, primarily positive and spiritual connotations like hope, change and love (<a href=\"https://dragonflytransitions.com/why-the-dragonfly/\">x</a>). What is especially interesting in the context of GRRM\u2019s story is the fact that dragonflies were also associated with dragons in Western folklore:<br></p><blockquote><p><i>\n\nOne of the earliest reference to the name \u2018dragonfly\u2019 is on the book Sylva Sylvarum, or a Naturall Historie: In Ten Centuries (Classic Reprint) by Francis Bacon \u2013 an indeed fascinating read on ancient teachings, observations and experiments. Even though we can\u2019t be 100% sure, it\u2019s widely believed that Bacon picked up on a very common folklore name that was used at the time. And this should come as no surprise as <b>dragonflies were widely used in folklore throughout the world and it was believed that they once were dragons</b>.</i> (<a href=\"https://theuijunkie.com/dragonfly-name-origin/\">x</a>)<br></p></blockquote><p>Within the universe that GRRM has established for his story, there is a historical character called the <a href=\"http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Duncan_Targaryen\">Prince of Dragonflies</a>, Duncan Targaryen who gave up the throne for the love. The Prince of Dragonflies and his lady love, <a href=\"http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Jenny_of_Oldstones\">Jenny of Oldstones</a>, is the subject of at least one romantic song - and in this respect the dragonfly is connected with the songs of romance that the young and innocent Sansa loves so dearly. <b>Does this mean that Sansa\u2019s dragonfly motif in the show is meant to refer to the story of the Prince of Dragonflies? </b>I honestly don\u2019t know. While Michele Clapton has read the books (<a href=\"https://latimesblogs.latimes.com/showtracker/2012/03/creative-minds-game-of-thrones-costume-designer-michele-clapton.html\">x</a>) and spoken with GRRM (<a href=\"https://www.spin.com/2013/05/game-of-thrones-costume-designer-michele-clapton-interview-hbo/\">x</a>), I haven\u2019t been able to find any quotes of hers about Sansa\u2019s dragonflies.</p><p>Since Michele Clapton hasn\u2019t spoken about her use of the dragonfly motif, it is important to be careful when ascribing it a specific symbolic meaning. However, in general, the dragonfly is most often associated with transformation since it is a <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/metamorphosis\">metamorphic</a> creature that undergoes a pupate stage before it emerges in its adult form with the beautiful iridescent wings. <b>The dragonfly as a symbol of transformation is incredibly apt when it comes to the narrative arc of Sansa Stark - she is constantly forced to adapt and change by external circumstances.</b> At the same time the fragile beauty of the adult dragonfly is also a very fitting image for Sansa\u2019s youthful beauty when she\u2019s a captive in the early seasons. <i>The dragonfly as a general symbol of transformation is also supported by the use of moths and butterflies as secondary symbols in her personal iconography.</i></p><p>If the dragonfly mainly symbolizes transformation in Sansa\u2019s personal iconography then it is no coincidence that the symbol first appear after she\u2019s left Winterfell - since this is really the point where her narrative journey starts to gain momentum. This is this very beginning of first transformation; from Northern girl to Southern lady - but that is just the first of her many transformations.</p><h2>The Moth and the Butterfly</h2><p>Moths and butterflies are secondary symbols in Sansa\u2019s personal iconography. In season 1, Sansa wears ring in what looks to be the shape of a moth, at least the ragged edges of the wings suggest a moth rather than a butterfly.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"2788\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e8b0703b2fa1952bffa1e2e1c5b97cd8/tumblr_inline_plpk3zSByP1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"2788\"></figure><p>In season 3, a necklace with either a butterfly or a moth motif is introduced - as are set of bodice clasps that either looks like moth wings or a type of helicopter seed pods (<a href=\"https://www.bustle.com/articles/85163-sansa-starks-fashion-evolution-through-game-of-thrones-and-how-her-wardrobe-mirrors-her-character\">x)</a>.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"1632\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/670235b26228a8750094a0d9b4ee27e8/tumblr_inline_pm55vbAijg1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"1632\"></figure><p>If these claps are meant to represent helicopter seed pods rather than moth/butterfly wings, then the question is this: are they meant to be decorative or symbolic? And if they are symbolic, what do they symbolize? In general terms, seed pods represent the continuation of the life cycle of they tree they come from - they fly away, fall to the ground where they lie dormant during winter until it is time put forth the first tendrils of a new plant when spring arrives. So in a sense, the seed pods of Sansa\u2019s claps can be said to signify growth and change just like the dragonfly.</p><p>The symbolism of both moths and butterflies varies vastly in accordance with cultural context - while there\u2019s some overlap between certain cultures, other cultures ascribe these creatures very different meanings (<a href=\"https://www.insects.orkin.com/ced/issue-4/lepidopteral-symbolism/list-1/\">x</a>, <a href=\"https://www.insects.orkin.com/ced/issue-4/lepidopteral-symbolism/list-2/\">x</a>) - not to mention the meanings that New Age philosophy ascribes to these creatures (<a href=\"http://mothsymbolism.com/\">x</a>). <b>There is NO universal symbolism of the butterfly and the moth!</b> Many of the meanings ascribed to them are culturally specific and it is important to be aware of this. I\u2019m not going to list the various symbolic meanings because there are a lot of them. Moths and butterflies belong to the same family of insects (lepidoptera). While butterflies are primarily diurnal (active during the day), moths are predominantly noctural (active at night) or crepuscular (active at twilight). Moths and butterflies sometimes have contrasting symbolic meanings and sometimes synonymous symbolic meanings, all dependent on cultural context.\u00a0</p><h2>However, in a very general sense, both moths and butterflies are symbols of transformation as they, like the dragonfly, are metamorphic creatures.\u00a0</h2><p>They are also delicate and fragile. However, just like in the case of the dragonfly, Clapton hasn\u2019t said anything about this motif - but considering that the certain parts of the symbolism of these winged creatures overlap with the dragonfly, I think it is safe to say that butterflies and moths serve the same symbolic function as the dragonfly - to signal metamorphosis and change. In this respect I agree completely with Freya Lilian Porteus:</p><blockquote><p><i>\n\nMoths, dragonflies, and butterflies are metamorphic creatures that, despite their visually flimsy allure and delicate nature, evolve and grow as they shift and change. I feel like they are a very apt metaphor for Sansa Stark, who, through her pain due to her fragile place in society as a woman, is never broken entirely. She only evolves and grows as she shifts and changes through self realization.</i> (<a href=\"https://www.bustle.com/articles/85163-sansa-starks-fashion-evolution-through-game-of-thrones-and-how-her-wardrobe-mirrors-her-character\">x</a>)<br></p></blockquote><p>Moths especially are also creatures that employ camouflage in order to hide from predators and can thus be said to signify adaptability, which is certainly a character trait that Sansa possesses - as she tries to avoid drawing attention to herself at Joffrey\u2019s court.</p><p>Throughout the show, <b>Sansa constantly has to adapt to her circumstances.</b> She evolves continually - <b>and like a dragonfly/moth/butterfly she repeatedly emerges from one chrysalis after the other - often signaled by a radical change of style in her costume.</b> As the story progresses the stylistic changes becomes more and more marked whereas they are more subtle and gradual during the early seasons.</p><h2><b>A GILDED CAGE - SANSA\u2019S WEDDING GOWN</b></h2><p>While all the costumes are narratively important in <i>Game of Thrones</i>, some costumes carry a greater narrative weight than others, often because they are loaded with symbolic value. This is the case of Sansa\u2019s wedding dress in season 3 since this garment is meant to be a visual manifestation of the way that the Lannisters take ownership of Sansa (and her claim to Winterfell) through her forced marriage to Tyrion Lannister. When talking about this particular costume designer Michele Clapton and embroiderer Michele Carragher both repeatedly use words like\u00a0\u201ccaught\u201d,\u00a0\u201centrapment\u201d,\u00a0\u201cdomination\u201d and \u201cownership\u201d:</p><blockquote><p>\n\n<i>When Sansa is married against her will into the Lannister family, her dress shows her family\u2019s sigil, the dire wolf, losing out to the Lannister\u2019s, the lion. </i><b><i>\u201cIt\u2019s like she has been caught,\u201d explains Clapton</i>. </b>(Michele Clapton,<b>\u00a0</b><a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fastcompany.com%2F3028226%2Fdeciphering-the-hidden-messages-in-game-of-thrones-costumes&amp;t=ODAxMWRiZGUwNDQyZGVlOGI4MmM1MDdmZmMwZTc3MzlmYmI4ZmU0OSxqazZlM3QzTQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AYD5-STb8ovo6MvPS6P_ZLA&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Ftrinuviel.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F179869368779%2Fquotes-on-sansas-s3-wedding-dress&amp;m=1\">FastCompany</a>)\n\n<br></p><p>\n\n<i>There\u2019s always a movement, particularly in Sansa, where you always see which way she\u2019s being pulled.

There\u2019s a reason for this stark difference between the costumes because <b>whereas Sansa\u2019s purple dresses signal her removal from the influence of Cersei, the wedding dress is a statement of Lannister dominance over her person and her body.</b> The embroidery plays an especially important role in this context but I\u2019ll return to that subject of the embroidery later on. First I want to take closer look on the general silhouette of the dress as well as the fabric and the colour - because these elements also carry meaning.</p><p>This dress is a sort of curious combination of the voluminous skirt and a tight sleeveless bodice, which gives the whole ensemble a slightly unbalanced look. The skirt is wider and more voluminous than what is seen on other female characters at the royal court, so this isn\u2019t a dress that conforms to the local style. The skirt looks to be supported by some kind of armature underneath, very like the panniers at the hips that were used to create width in the skirts during the rococo style of the 18th century.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"2020\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/ba3077226f29cfc38fbc485bade376a8/tumblr_inline_pm5b7n4peK1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"2020\"></figure><p>The skirt also has a bit of a train and with the sleeveless bodice, the overall effect is of a dress that is a bit bottom-heavy. <b>The aesthetics of the gown is just slightly off and that is intentional.</b>\u00a0The lack of sleeves is an especially important detail according to the embroiderer:</p><blockquote><p>\n\n<i><b>For this dress, Michelle wanted it to be a confined, restricted bodice shape with bare, vulnerable arms. </b>She wanted an embroidered band that would wrap around the bodice and tell Sansa\u2019s life story.</i>\u00a0(Michele Carragher,\u00a0<a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwinteriscoming.net%2F2014%2F04%2F06%2Fmichele-carragher-michelle-clapton-on-the-secret-narratives-in-game-of-thrones-wardrobe%2F&amp;t=OTFlODRmN2VjOGNhMmE2MTc4YjY2YTZjMDAyMzE1YjFkODAzOTM5OCxqazZlM3QzTQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AYD5-STb8ovo6MvPS6P_ZLA&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Ftrinuviel.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F179869368779%2Fquotes-on-sansas-s3-wedding-dress&amp;m=1\">Winter Is Coming</a>)\n\n<br></p></blockquote><p>Thus, the lack of sleeves is meant to signify vulnerability, the bodice itself tight and restrictive, trapping Sansa in her dress. The skirt itself is a bit curious in that regard - <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mK0qwUAJ3xddgqxDZTxlodQ\">@caesarscat</a> <a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/181709643144/im-not-a-fashion-expert-i-love-fashion-and-keep\">suggests</a> that it is meant to create a more womanly shape for a bride that is still a child, and that is certainly a possibility. However, the volume of the skirt and the amount of fabric used (heavy brocade) must also make this dress heavy to walk in - it physically weighs her down as an external embodiment of how this whole situation weighs so heavily on her emotions.</p><p>The skirt also sports a very curious detail that contradicts the vulnerability of the bare arms. The panniers of dress is enhanced with pieces of metal (looks like bronze) with a chased pattern of plant-like arabesques.\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"2304\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/c7fa527720d4a64d6710c8ddfadd259e/tumblr_inline_plpk9z2mDz1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"2304\"></figure><p>This is eerily similar to Cersei\u2019s armoured dress from season 2. Cersei literally wore armour when she felt threatened and thus these pieces of metal also evoke Sansa\u2019s dictum of<i> Courtesy is a lady\u2019s armour</i>. So while the dress primarily works as a bodily trap, restricting Sansa\u2019s movements and metaphorically exposing her vulnerable position, it also contains this tiny hint of Sansa\u2019s preferred form of passive resistance: Her use of politesse as a form of emotional armour where she keeps people at arms length, refusing to let them see how she feels - a technique she uses on Tyrion in the <a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/182045002204/winterfells-daughter-on-sansa-stark-part-15\">scene</a> right before the wedding ceremony.</p><p>I\u2019ve previously pointed out how Sansa\u2019s season 3 costumes signal a remove from the Lannister influence, particularly Cersei\u2019s. The wedding dress is a conspicuous re-assertion of that influence, but now in the form of dominance rather than emulation. The deep purple colours have been replaced with a shiny, gold-accented brocade very like the fabrics used for Cersei\u2019s and Joffrey\u2019s costumes.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"2020\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/5017cb44691438263be4069a938297cd/tumblr_inline_plsuar1XCy1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"2020\"></figure><p>The fastening of the bodice has also reverted to the side-flap that characterized her kimono dresses, which were emulating Cersei\u2019s season 1 look.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"1088\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/aba6f39bbb4e75b25d59f727d6c96d42/tumblr_inline_plsubdYC6t1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"1088\"></figure><p>At the same time, the wedding dress contains a very subtle callback to Sansa\u2019s Tourney dress from season one since the base colour of the gold-accented brocade is a pale lavender very similar to the season 1 dress. In a way, the use of the lavender colour is a cruel appropriation of this romantic dress (which incidentally also sports an embroidered direwolf like the wedding dress). The Tourney dress represent Sansa\u2019s romanticism and her love of Chivalric Romance (<a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/167245522589/winterfells-daughter-on-sansa-stark-part-5\">x</a>) - but now that romanticism has been put into a golden Lannister cage where marriage is not a union of lovers but a cynic power move against her family.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"3187\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/512df38cef63fa5384b85c2c61954a44/tumblr_inline_plpk7cy2fZ1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"3187\"></figure><p>Another thing I noticed upon my re-watch of the wedding scene is how Sansa\u2019s dress visually matches Joffrey\u2019s opulent costume in terms of both colour and fabric. I\u2019ve <a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/179909400489/the-rose-of-highgarden-on-margaery-tyrell-part\">previously written</a> about how matching clothes can be used to convey political and familial unity in the case of the Tyrells. In this case, however, the visual match between Sansa\u2019s and Joffrey\u2019s costumes signals domination rather than unity.\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"1352\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/dd756141668ca9bfdbac5291b1c54cb8/tumblr_inline_plsucgu0AU1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"1352\"></figure><p>In this context, the way that Sansa\u2019s and Tyrion\u2019s costumes don\u2019t match is also meaningful. While Sansa is wearing gold-and-lavender brocade, Tyrion is wearing a tunic in oxblood leather. They clash visually, standing next to each other at the altar. However, after Sansa has been garbed in the red-gold Lannister bridal cloak, the dark red accent of the cloak suddenly makes her costume match Tyrion\u2019s. Once again, this is not a visual statement of unity but rather of domination. With the cloaking of the bride, Tyrion (and through him House Lannister) takes possession of Sansa. She is now their property, bound to them permanently through the bonds of matrimony.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1982\" data-orig-height=\"724\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b038f639170cbf98e71cf7a112f7ce7b/tumblr_inline_plpkqcrdwL1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1982\" data-orig-height=\"724\"></figure><p>Sansa\u2019s wedding costume also includes another element that harks back to her earlier romantic self - the lion medallion that Joffrey gave her as a love token in season 1 (he was insincere but to Sansa it was a gesture straight out of the chivalric romances she loved so much). Now this symbol of romantic love has been subverted into yet another message of domination, of ownership.</p><h2>Embroidery</h2><p>As we can see, the shape, the fabric and the colour of a costume can carry a lot of meaning. However, Clapton adds yet another narrative layer in the form of an embroidered band that wraps around the bodice and acts as a symbolic cage in the same manner that the dress itself functions as a material cage that envelops and restricts Sansa\u2019s body.

The oldest depiction of the pomegranate in the arts date was found in the city of Uruk in ancient Sumer and dates back more than 5,000 years (<a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/archaeology/.premium.MAGAZINE-before-judaism-the-8-000-year-old-history-of-pomegranate-reverence-1.6461970\">x</a>). It was connected to the cult of<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inanna\"> Ishtar</a>/Innana, goddess of love, sex, fertility.</p><p>Throughout the Mediterranean, Near Eastern and Middle Eastern world, <b>the pomegranate</b> has been revered as <b>an ancient and potent symbol of fertility, regeneration and marriage</b>:</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cPeople use whatever is at hand to express their religious beliefs,\"says Frank A. Salamone, an authority on religious symbols and a professor at Iona College in New Rochelle, N.Y. Centuries ago, in the Fertile Crescent, where so many religions arose, the pomegranate was at hand. By its very nature, it lent itself to religious symbolism.<br></i></p><p><i>\"The pomegranate is red, and so is blood,\u201d Salamone says. \u201cIt has a lot of seeds and is an obvious symbol of fertility.\u201d It\u2019s beautiful, strong and delicate, and its juice has healing properties, he says. \u201cIt says a lot of different things all at once. People bring meaning to it.\u201d</i> (<a href=\"https://www.beliefnet.com/news/2005/11/a-pomegranate-for-all-religions.aspx\">Prof. Frank A. Salamone</a>)<br></p></blockquote><p>The pomegranate tree is considered to have <a href=\"https://itsallgreeklondon.wordpress.com/2014/10/29/the-significance-of-the-pomegranate-in-ancient-greece/\">originated</a> in the in Persia (Iran) and its connection with notions of fertility is intimately connected with the advent and spread of agriculture. It\u2019s status as a symbol of fertility was most likely transmitted through a kind of cross-cultural pollination along with the tree as it was exported East to China and West to Egypt, Turkey, North Africa, Greece and Rome.</p><p>While it is a fertility symbol in many cultures, the fruit also became associated with Death and Resurrection in Greek and Roman mythology. Most famously in the <a href=\"http://itsallgreeklondon.wordpress.com/2014/10/29/the-significance-of-the-pomegranate-in-ancient-greece/\">myth of Persephone</a>, daughter of the fertility goddess Demeter. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persephone\">Persephone</a> was a vegetation goddess like Demeter but according to myth she was abducted by Hades, the God of the Underworld. Demeter went into mourning and all plant life died so Zeus commanded Hades to release her daughter. However, Hades had tricked Persephone into eating six pomegranate seeds and so she was forced to spend six months of the year as Queen of the Underworld and the remaining six months above ground as a goddess of spring. The myth of Persephone is essentially an allegorical retelling of the changing of the seasons - and thus <b>the pomegranate is not just connected to fertility</b> (spring) <b>but also</b> <b>to death</b> (winter) <b>and resurrection</b> (the re-emergence of spring).</p><p>However, the pomegranate as a symbol of death and resurrection is also connected to another mythical figure: Adonis, the lover of Venus, the Roman goddess of love and sex. In the <i>Metamorphoses</i>, the Roman poet Ovid recounts the tale of Adonis who is slain on a hunt and the grief-stricken Venus creates the anemone flower, red like a pomegranate in memory of him:</p><blockquote><p><i>When from the heights she saw the lifeless body lying in its own blood, she leapt down, tearing her clothes, and tearing at her hair as well, and beat at her breasts with fierce hands, complaining to the fates. \u201cAnd yet not everything is in your power\u201d she said. \u201cAdonis, there shall be an everlasting token of my grief, and every year an imitation of your death will complete a re-enactment of my mourning. <b>But your blood will be changed into a flower</b>\u2026\u201d So saying, she sprinkled the blood with odorous nectar: and, at the touch, it swelled up, as bubbles emerge in yellow mud. <b>In less than an hour, a flower, of the colour of blood, was created such as pomegranates carry, that hide their seeds under a tough rind.</b> But enjoyment of it is brief: for, lightly clinging, and too easily fallen, the winds deflower it, which are likewise responsible for its name, windflower: anemone</i>\u2019 (<a href=\"http://ovidsmetamorphoses.blogspot.com/2012/08/an-anemone-for-adonis.html\">Source</a>)</p></blockquote><p>According to myth, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adonis\">Adonis</a> was raised by Persephone in the Underworld - but the figure has much older roots in the Sumerian story of Innana and Dumuzid. Adonis is thus very likely connected to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dying-and-rising_deity\">Dying-and-Rising archetype</a>, which characterizes a number of male fertility gods in the Middle Eastern and Mediterranean region of during Antiquity.</p><p>Christianity also appropriated the symbolism of Fertility and Resurrection associated with the pomegranate into its iconography:</p><blockquote><p><i><b>\n\nIn Christian art the pomegranate</b>, often split\nand showing the seeds, <b>was interpreted as a\nsymbol of fertility, hope of immortality, and\nthe Resurrection</b>. The infant Jesus is frequently seen in paintings and sculpture presenting\nthe pomegranate to his mother. In the last of\nthe famous Unicorn tapestries at The Cloisters the symbolic meaning of marriage and fertility is illustrated by showing the Unicorn\nchained to the pomegranate tree, with the red\nseeds of a bursting fruit spilling on him.</i> (<a href=\"https://www.metmuseum.org/pubs/bulletins/1/pdf/3257268.pdf.bannered.pdf\">Hildegard Schneider</a>)<br></p></blockquote><p>So the pomegranates on Sansa\u2019s wedding dress has a very old and rich symbolic history - and <b>the connection between the pomegranate and fertility is very apt in this context since the Lannisters intend for Sansa to bear fruit in her marriage in the form of a Lannister-Stark child</b> through which they can claim the North.</p><p>Even more interesting is the fact that Sansa has her very own pomegranate symbolism in GRRM\u2019s text. After Petyr Baelish spirits Sansa away to the Fingers, he offers her pomegranates and other fruits during a private conversation where he\u2019s imparting his particular brand of wisdom:</p><blockquote><p><i>\n\nGrisel reappeared before he could say more, balancing a large platter. She set it down between them. There were apples and pears and pomegranates, some sad-looking grapes, a huge blood orange. The old woman had brought a round of bread as well, and a crock of butter. <b>Petyr cut a pomegranate in two with his dagger, offering half to Sansa.</b> \u201cYou should try and eat, my lady.\u201d \u201cThank you, my lord.\u201d <b>Pomegranate seeds were so messy; Sansa chose a pear instead</b>, and took a small delicate bite. It was very ripe. The juice ran down her chin.</i></p><p><i>\u2026</i></p><p><i>\u201cIn King\u2019s Landing, there are two sorts of people. The players and the pieces.\u201d\n\n<br></i></p><p><i>\n\n\u201cAnd I was a piece?\u201d She dreaded the answer.</i></p><p><i>\u201cYes, but don\u2019t let that trouble you. You\u2019re still half a child. Every man\u2019s a piece to start with, and every maid as well. Even some who think they are players.\u201d He ate another seed. \u201cCersei, for one. She thinks herself sly, but in truth she is utterly predictable. Her strength rests on her beauty, birth, and riches. Only the first of those is truly her own, and it will soon desert her. I pity her then. She wants power, but has no notion what to do with it when she gets it. <b>Everyone wants something, Alayne. And when you know what a man wants you know who he is, and how to move him</b>.\"\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u2026</i></p><p><i><b>\n\nLord Petyr</b> dismissed him with a wave, and <b>returned to the pomegranate again</b> as Oswell shuffled down the steps. \u201d<b>Tell me, Alayne\u2014which is more dangerous, the dagger brandished by an enemy, or the hidden one</b> pressed to your back by someone you never even see?\u201c</i></p><p><i>\"The hidden dagger.\u201d</i>\u00a0(ASoS, Sansa VI)\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>Baelish then starts to eat a blood orange as he continues to talk, steadily guiding Sansa through his machinations until she realizes that it was Olenna Tyrell who poisoned Joffrey:</p><blockquote><p><i>\n\nHe tilted his chin back and squeezed the blood orange, so the juice ran down into his mouth. \u201cI love the juice but I loathe the sticky fingers,\u201d he complained, wiping his hands. \u201c<b>Clean</b> <b>hands, Sansa. Whatever you do, make certain your hands are clean.</b>\u201d</i> (ASoS, Sansa VI)<br></p></blockquote><p>The conversation goes on as Baelish relates exactly how he manipulated the Tyrells into doing what he wanted.</p><p>This is not just a conversation over fruit where Baelish instructs his new pupil in the subtleties of the game of thrones. <b>It is a temptation scenario where he offers Sansa a fruit associated with temptation as he intends to mold her into his own image. </b>Like Hades, Baelish<b>\u00a0</b>tempts Sansa with the pomegranate but unlike Persephone, Sansa refuses the fruit.\u00a0</p><h2>Sansa REFUSES the pomegranate! This is very important because it foreshadows her eventually rejecting Baelish and his nefarious ambitions.</h2><p>This temptation scenario is lent even more symbolic weight if we consider the hypothesis that the Forbidden Fruit in the Garden of Eden might not have been an apple but a pomegranate! (<a href=\"https://iranian.com/2009/05/04/it-was-a-pomegranate-not-an-apple-depicted-in-the-biblical-garden-of-eden-part-i/\">x</a>) This interpretation is still somewhat controversial but if the Forbidden Fruit was indeed a pomegranate then the Temptation of Eve does have an interesting parallel with the Temptation of Persephone.</p><p>I have been unable to find any confirmation that the pomegranates on Sansa\u2019s wedding dress are meant to have a deeper meaning than an association to the Lannister red. However, Carragher develops her creations in collaboration with Clapton and she does quite a bit of historical research:</p><blockquote><p><i>\n\nFor \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d Carragher often spends as long thinking about a piece as she does making it. <b>First, she confers with Clapton about each character\u2019s narrative arc </b>and the costumes Clapton has designed for them. <b>Then Carragher does historical research</b> in museums near her home, in East London. After a month of planning, she ships her materials to the show\u2019s Belfast production studios, where she works six days a week, twelve hours a day, embellishing a season\u2019s worth of costumes.</i> (<a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/embroidering-game-of-thrones\">The NewYorker</a>)<br></p></blockquote><h2>Thus, it is not implausible that adorning a wedding dress with\u00a0an age old symbol of fertility and marriage is not entirely coincidental on the part of the designers!</h2></p>",

This post is the 17th installment in this series and the last one that deals with Sansa\u2019s season 3 arc.\u00a0<br></p><p>In this post, I\u2019m going to take a closer look at Sansa\u2019s costumes during the season with a special emphasis on her spectacular golden wedding gown since her season 3 arc revolves around her political value as Robb\u2019s heir apparent and there are several plots aimed at securing the Key to the North through marriage. It is also a costume that is inscribed with a lot of narrative and symbolic meaning that subtly enriches her story and her characterization.</p><p>Costume design is an integral aspect of the visual language of cinema and television - and especially on <i>Game of Thrones </i>since costume designer Michele Clapton approaches the costumes in terms of story-telling.</p><blockquote><p><i>I always try to <b>make the clothes visually tell something</b>.</i> (<a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.fidmmuseum.org%2Fmuseum%2F2018%2F09%2Finterview-with-game-of-thrones-costume-designer-michele-clapton.html&amp;t=NGI5YzYxY2NlMjQ3ZTFhMGJiMTRiZDY4NjkwNjBjMjdiNjZlYTQwOCx4eUJnV1ZaYg%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AYD5-STb8ovo6MvPS6P_ZLA&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Ftrinuviel.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F179909400489%2Fthe-rose-of-highgarden-on-margaery-tyrell-part&amp;m=1\">FIDM Museum Blog</a>) <br></p><p><i>I always try to tell that story \u2014 <b>the costumes for me are narrative</b> and you should be able to look at them [the characters] and understand where they are mentally in their journey.</i> (<a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thisisinsider.com%2Fgame-of-thrones-costume-designer-michele-clapton-interview-2017-6&amp;t=NTIxNTlmMTQ5MDZmYmVlNjdjZWJhM2M0Y2VkMmQ5ZmI3NGI1NTZjMCx4eUJnV1ZaYg%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AYD5-STb8ovo6MvPS6P_ZLA&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Ftrinuviel.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F179909400489%2Fthe-rose-of-highgarden-on-margaery-tyrell-part&amp;m=1\">Insider</a>)</p><p>\n\n<i><b>I love to try and indicate the emotional state of characters through their costumes, and also to indicate their influence over other characters and courts. </b>Sometimes this says so much more than words.</i> (<a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.spin.com%2F2013%2F05%2Fgame-of-thrones-costume-designer-michele-clapton-interview-hbo%2F&amp;t=NWMzN2ExM2MzZGU4YjY5NjIzYmExOWY4MzY4NGE2ZDU3YTgxM2NiZCxqazZlM3QzTQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AYD5-STb8ovo6MvPS6P_ZLA&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Ftrinuviel.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F179869368779%2Fquotes-on-sansas-s3-wedding-dress&amp;m=1\">SPIN</a>)\n\n<br></p></blockquote><p>Thus, the costumes are incredibly important in this show and it is worth paying attention to them because every single detail is meaningful:</p><blockquote><p>\n\n<i><b>Everything \u2013 even a fashion choice \u2013 has meaning on \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d </b>In this cutthroat world where men fight for the Iron Throne and the women yield a different kind of power, <b>a choice of fabric or a different cut of cloth can be a political statement, costume designer Michele Clapton told TODAY.com</b></i><b>.</b>(<a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.today.com%2Fstyle%2Fwhat-expect-costumes-season-3-game-thrones-1C9143460&amp;t=YTMwZTU5MjllNmQ3NTU4MjAzYzI2Y2I1NjBkZjMxYWY3YTUxNDEwOSxqazZlM3QzTQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AYD5-STb8ovo6MvPS6P_ZLA&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Ftrinuviel.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F179869368779%2Fquotes-on-sansas-s3-wedding-dress&amp;m=1\">Today</a>)\n\n<br></p></blockquote><p>Even in real life, clothing has always had symbolic and communicative value through which people signal social and cultural positions. In short, fashion and dress codes place people within a given culture. <i>Garments function as non-verbal signs that\u00a0that can be interpreted differently depending on the context, situation or culture </i>(<a href=\"http://theministeroffashion.com/semiotics-of-fashion/\">x</a>). That is doubly so for costume design since it its entire raison d\u2019etre is to support and enrich the story that is told.</p>[[MORE]]<h2><b>THE SARTORIAL EVOLUTION OF SANSA STARK</b></h2><p>As said, Sansa\u2019s golden wedding dress will be the primary focus of this post - both because of its symbolic value but also because it is markedly different from the rest of her costumes during season 3. However, before I start analyzing the wedding dress it will be instructive to take a look at how she generally dresses during season 3 because the colour, cut and embellishment of the wedding dress stands in stark contrast to the rest of her costumes.</p><p>The costumes are an important part of the story-telling but they are an especially important part of Sansa\u2019s character since she\u2019s the only character that is repeatedly shown to make her own clothes! This is something that Michele Clapton emphasizes in several interviews:</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cShe expresses herself through her ability to embroider and stitch,\u201d Clapton told Buzzfeed. <b>\u201cWe\u2019ve always used that as something that Sansa expresses her feelings through\u2014her embroidery and depictions on her costumes, and through shade and color.\u201d </b></i>(<a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.looper.com%2F103763%2Fhidden-meanings-behind-costumes-game-thrones%2F&amp;t=MTkzZTdkZDU1MTg5YTY0MTM5YjFmZmQ5NGZiMjZhYmVkOTE4NDBmMyxqazZlM3QzTQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AYD5-STb8ovo6MvPS6P_ZLA&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Ftrinuviel.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F179869368779%2Fquotes-on-sansas-s3-wedding-dress&amp;m=1\">Looper</a>)</p><p><i><b>Costume is important to Sansa\u2014she sees it as a way of communicating with people, to show her aspirations.

The Starks represent a warm family unit, so the blues of their costumes are rather warm. But within the family, the various personalities are reflected in what they wear. For example, Sansa is in a slightly cooler blue.</i>\u00a0(<a href=\"http://costumevault.blogspot.com/2016/08/creating-seven-kingdoms-part-i-north.html\">CostumeVault</a>)\u00a0<br></p></blockquote><p>\n\nInterestingly, Clapton also uses this light blue as a way to emphasize that Sansa is somewhat out of sync with the rest of her family. This becomes especially clear when the Starks line up to greet King Robert in the first episode. While the rest of the Starks are dressed in dark blues and greys, Sansa is exclusively dressed in the light baby blue - even the fur on her cloak is light blue! This makes Sansa stand out like a sore thumb among the Stark household. Considering how Clapton approaches costume design in terms of both story-telling and characterization, this choice is no coincidence.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1024\" data-orig-height=\"576\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/1ae989bb84840e764d4cf194c0f966a1/tumblr_inline_plqz3kMnvC1uklhai_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1024\" data-orig-height=\"576\"></figure><p>She is, in a sense, a bit isolated within in her own family given how none of her siblings share her interests, not to mention that gender norms also play a role in relation to this issue (<a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/166994576194/winterfells-daughter-on-sansa-stark-part-1\">x</a>). While this isn\u2019t something that the show really delves into at the level of the text, the costuming clearly articulates a sense of isolation within the family when it comes to Sansa - and that is probably one of the reasons why she\u2019s so excited to travel to King\u2019s Landing.<br></p><p>Sansa\u2019s costumes changes when she arrives in King\u2019s Landing. A significant costume is the lavender dress that she first wears at the Hand\u2019s Tourney. This dress represents a sartorial amalgam of the Northern and the King\u2019s Landing style. The lavender colour occupy a mid-point between Sansa\u2019s Northern blue and the dusty rose colours that the women wear at the court in King\u2019s Landing. However, the fabric is similar to her Northern dress and the embroidery not only includes her House Sigil (the Direwolf) but the leafy vines that climb the sides of the dress are rather similar to the embroidery on her Winterfell feast dress (picture at the far right in the collage below)</p><figure data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"1515\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/5472c9776e9b0e1c4e754ddffd4796db/tumblr_inline_plpk1lMVAe1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"1515\"></figure><p>The most conspicuous detail is the neckline, which is not only significantly lower than her Northern dresses but it is also embellished with cloth roses - an completely new element in Sansa\u2019s personal iconography (<a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/167245522589/winterfells-daughter-on-sansa-stark-part-5\">x</a>). This dress also marks the beginning of Sansa\u2019s slow transition from a child to a young girl at the cusp of maidenhood.</p><p>Later in the season, Sansa\u2019s Northern dresses are completely discarded - and she is now dressed in the kimono-style of light-weight fabric like the ones that Cersei wears.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"1515\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/f8c9de4d607ca3c3e520a6742b3297f2/tumblr_inline_plpiduhHqw1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"1515\"></figure><p>However, it is also important to note that she only starts wearing these Cersei-inspired costumes after she has fallen completely within the power of the Lannisters.</p><blockquote><p>\n\n<i>Where a character comes from is indicated through the color and cut of the costume.<b> </b>When we first see Sansa [Sophie Turner], she wears things in a Stark way \u2014 very well, but they are slightly clumsy and the cloth is rather homespun. As she comes to King\u2019s Landing, her progression is influenced by Cersei [Lena Headey] and her costumes shift. <b>After Cersei does the awful thing of sanctioning the death of Ned Stark [Sansa\u2019s father], Sansa is stuck \u2014 you can see her frozen in time. She\u2019s looking like someone who has just killed her father. And then we will see her progression as she slowly withdraws from the look. </b></i>(<a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Flatimesblogs.latimes.com%2Fshowtracker%2F2012%2F03%2Fcreative-minds-game-of-thrones-costume-designer-michele-clapton.html&amp;t=Y2I0Y2RkNzQzN2NiZjI4ODAxNjU1MjRjZTIyZDNiNTY0ZDNmYzQ3NyxqazZlM3QzTQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AYD5-STb8ovo6MvPS6P_ZLA&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Ftrinuviel.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F179869368779%2Fquotes-on-sansas-s3-wedding-dress&amp;m=1\">LATimes</a>)\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>A very important detail of these Cersei-like costumes is the fact that they don\u2019t fit Sansa at all! They are much too large and she\u2019s practically drowning in them. This is a very important detail:</p><blockquote><p>\n\n<i>\u201cA lot of people said her costume doesn\u2019t fit. Well, of course it doesn\u2019t! <b>She\u2019s a young girl trying to copy someone</b>,\u201d explained Clapton. \u201cNot everyone wears things brilliantly or beautifully, or has the access to do that. <b>I think it\u2019s really important that some things don\u2019t fit. </b>Some things are slightly odd.\u201d </i>(<a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fastcompany.com%2F3028226%2Fdeciphering-the-hidden-messages-in-game-of-thrones-costumes&amp;t=ODAxMWRiZGUwNDQyZGVlOGI4MmM1MDdmZmMwZTc3MzlmYmI4ZmU0OSxqazZlM3QzTQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AYD5-STb8ovo6MvPS6P_ZLA&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Ftrinuviel.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F179869368779%2Fquotes-on-sansas-s3-wedding-dress&amp;m=1\">FastCompany</a>)\n\n<br></p></blockquote><p>Sansa is not only trying to copy someone much older but she\u2019s also wearing these garments at a point in the story where she\u2019s cut adrift from her family - her father is imprisoned and her sister is missing. She is completely at the mercy of the Lannisters - utterly dependent on their\u00a0\u201cmercy\u201d while she at the same time desperately tries to save her father. It is no coincidence that she\u2019s wearing her blue kimono dress when she publicly begs for her father\u2019s life and the rose kimono-dress at his public confession (that she thought would save his life) as well as later on when Joffrey forces her to look at Ned Stark\u2019s severed head.\u00a0</p><p><b><i>When</i> a costume is worn within the narrative is just as important as how it looks.</b></p><h2>Season 2</h2><p>Sansa has a fewer costumes in season 2. Whereas she had 8 different costumes in season 1, now she has 4 costumes - and two of those are repeats from the former season, which also reflects that she is no longer a privileged young noble with many new dresses. She starts the season in her two kimono dresses - this conforms to a pattern of Clapton\u2019s where she has a character wear a costume from the latter part of the previous season in the early part of the new season (<a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/179909400489/the-rose-of-highgarden-on-margaery-tyrell-part\">x</a>) This serves create narrative continuity at the visual level.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"1009\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/f44490492497822e345f756d7485e5c3/tumblr_inline_plspdxPQ3O1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"1009\"></figure><p>This pattern also serves to express the emotional journey of the character.</p><blockquote><p>\n\n<i><b>I try to tell stories through the characters and certain characters move more in their costumes to tell their story whereas others, by not changing, tell their story. One doesn\u2019t change or one does and it actually almost heightens the difference in them.</b> I spend hours designing costumes, so much of my time is spent plotting the route. What would she wear in this situation and how can we get here there elegantly from this situation? Plotting the costumes is so important and so essential to the story for me, especially in a show like Game of Thrones, where you\u2019re constantly shifting to other people\u2019s stories, so it\u2019s knowing when to move them forward.</i>\n\n\n(<a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F4793537%2Fgame-of-thrones-costumes%2F&amp;t=YWE4MTNhY2ZkOTgzY2E0Y2E5M2Q3MWJhNjIyZGUzNGMyNjI0ZWMwZixqazZlM3QzTQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AYD5-STb8ovo6MvPS6P_ZLA&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Ftrinuviel.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F179869368779%2Fquotes-on-sansas-s3-wedding-dress&amp;m=1\">TIME</a>)\n\n\n<br></p></blockquote><p>During the season, Sansa\u2019s to kimono dresses are destroyed as they are quite literally torn off her body - one when she\u2019s beaten by the King\u2019s Guard (<a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/175216924789/winterfells-daughter-on-sansa-stark-part-7\">x</a>) and the other during the assault she suffers in the Bread Riots (<a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/175519427944/winterfells-daughter-on-sansa-stark-part-8\">x</a>).

These are garments that she wears in the privacy of her chambers. She may wear Southern style dress in court, but in private she wears garments that remind her of her home. The fact that she wears a garment connected to her home and her childhood in the scene where she gets her first period is also significant. The onset of menses is part of her physical maturation, she is no longer a child in the eyes of some people - and in the very next scene, she and Cersei discuss motherhood.\u00a0</p><p>After this scene, her fashion style changes dramatically. Her final costume in season 2 is radically different from the earlier ones - both in colour and in shape. Sansa debuts a dress in a deep purple patterned with wine-leaves, with long trailing sleeves and paired with a golden belt. It fits her much better than the previous kimono dresses and it closed in the front but opens at the neckline and the skirt to showcase an under-dress or a long scarf.<br></p><figure data-orig-width=\"450\" data-orig-height=\"450\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d2ab42161e785304eb1b516b9f73609d/tumblr_inline_plsulrNIZo1uklhai_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"450\" data-orig-height=\"450\"></figure><p>This is not the dress of a child but of a young woman.

In the books, Sansa rejects Cersei\u2019s\u00a0\u201cwisdom\u201d internally but since we don\u2019t get that inner monologue on the screen, the it is left to the costuming to visually express this rejection rejection of Cersei\u2019s influence.</p><h2>Season 3</h2><p>In season 3, the purple dress with the wine-leaf pattern not only makes a re-appearance, it also serves as the template for the rest of Sansa\u2019s wardrobe, apart from her wedding dress, which is in a radically different style than the rest of her season 3 dresses.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"1515\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/a92d1f45d36aec8a3ab7fa2a48a03ce9/tumblr_inline_plsqgoVs3H1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"1515\"></figure><p>Apart from her wedding dress, all of Sansa\u2019s costumes are in various shades of purple.

Whereas she wore garments in light blues, light lavender and light rose during seasons 1-2, in season 3 almost all of her dresses fall within the darker spectrum of the purple colours like dark magenta, amethyst and blue violet. <b>Clapton likes to use colour symbolically</b>:</p><blockquote><p><i>According to Clapton, color plays a pivotal role in foreshadowing characters\u2019 futures. <b>\u201cWe do all these sort of secret symbols, color hints about the ways the court is being influenced,\u201d says Clapton.</b>\u201d They are just little things that people may not notice unless they really look.\u201c We asked for examples but got no specifics. Instead Clapton hints again: \u201cYou can see the people who are getting the power by the way the court starts to dress. It\u2019s just a small thing, a color here and there and it slowly escalates. I think it\u2019s really important to do that because people tend to watch these episodes over and over again and later on box sets.

So the purple of Sansa\u2019s gowns may signal that she\u2019s influenced by very different people:</p><blockquote><p>\n\n<i><b>\u201cShe\u2019s still young and vulnerable\u2013she\u2019s always influenced by the people around her,\u201d Clapton said. </b>\u201cWithout saying too much, she befriends someone new.

In some cultures\u00a0<b>purple is associated with death, mourning and endurance of suffering</b> - and that certainly fits well with Sansa\u2019s narrative arc so far. But the colour <b>purple also has a long history as a sign of wealth, luxury and royalty!</b> The association between purple and royalty is particularly interesting in this case because season 3 includes a detail about Sansa that may foreshadow her becoming royalty, i.e. the ringing of the bells at her birth (<a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/180902951614/winterfells-daughter-on-sansa-stark-part-11\">x</a>).\u00a0Speaking of the use of colour as foreshadowing, I would be amiss not to mention the infamous Purple Wedding that takes place in season 4 and in which Sansa unwittingly plays a part by carrying a poison in the form of amethyst crystals. Incidentally, she wears purple at that feast as well.</p><p>While Sansa dresses like her mother in a visual repudiation of Cersei Lannister, her appearance is also subtly influenced by a new person in her orbit.<br></p><figure data-orig-width=\"880\" data-orig-height=\"488\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/c0184083bb888a36a55d586af35edaee/tumblr_inline_plspih3CJF1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"880\" data-orig-height=\"488\"></figure><p>Queen-to-be Margaery Tyrell befriends Sansa, first in order to learn what kind of person Joffrey is (<a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/181688895069/winterfells-daughter-on-sansa-stark-part-12\">x</a>) and later as part of a plot to marry Sansa to her brother Loras Tyrell in an effort to secure Sansa\u2019s claim to Winterfell for House Tyrell (<a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/181784314164/winterfells-daughter-on-sansa-stark-part-13\">x</a>).</p><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"249\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/eec3dcec611bdb5f85dc3b4814fda64f/tumblr_inline_plspq7L37m1uklhai_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"249\"></figure><p>Thus, after Margaery has made friends with Sansa (and after the secret bethrothal has been agreed up), Sansa begins to wear her hair like her new friend. Petyr Baelish notices this and comments upon it when Sansa politely rejects his offer to spirit her away from the capital. This is, incidentally, the second time that the style of Sansa\u2019s hair is directly referred to in the show - because when it comes to Sansa, her hair styles always communicate something! Here, it subtly signals her new alliance with the Tyrells (as well as Margaery\u2019s growing influence over the royal court). Throughout the seasons, we\u2019ll see how not only Sansa\u2019s clothes but also her hair is inscribed with meaning.</p><h2><b>DRAGONFLIES, BUTTERFLIES AND MOTHS - SANSA\u2019S PERSONAL ICONOGRAPHY</b></h2><p>Michele Clapton\u2019s costume design is, as said, always narratively important - and every little detail has meaning:</p><blockquote><p>\n\n<i>\u201cPeople don\u2019t necessarily see this,\u201d admitted Clapton.

Clapton almost always uses jewellery and embroidery symbolically - the most obvious examples being Cersei\u2019s lion embossed necklaces and lion embroidered gowns to Daenerys\u2019 dragon jewels and scaly embellishments and <a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/179909400489/the-rose-of-highgarden-on-margaery-tyrell-part\">Margaery\u2019s delicate roses</a>.\u00a0</p><p>Sansa also has her own personal iconography, which is expressed through the embroidery on her clothes and the jewellery she wears. However, (unlike Cersei, Daenerys and Margaery), Sansa\u2019s personal iconography in the early seasons are not rooted in her House sigil (though the direwolf does grace one of her season 1 dresses). <b>Thus, her iconography is more about Sansa\u2019s personal journey rather than her family identity, which is also her political identity </b>- though this changes during the later seasons. <b>This reflects both Sansa\u2019s initial desire to leave her family hom</b>e, to become part of a larger world <b>but later on, it can also be seen as an expression of how her political/familial identity becomes a liability for her at Joffrey\u2019s court </b>where she is brutally punished for her brother\u2019s victories. In this context, it is noteworthy that the Stark direwolves only make a brief appearance on her clothing when she is forcibly married to Tyrion Lannister - and here, her familial/political identity is exploited by the enemies of her house.<b>The Stark direwolf only makes a definitive return in season 6 and 7 when Sansa has finally escaped her enemies and embarks upon a quest to reclaim her family seat, emerging victorious as the Lady of Winterfell.</b>\u00a0</p><h2><b>In that sense, the withholding of the Stark direwolf from her costuming is just as meaningful as Clapton\u2019s choice to withhold the Targaryen red from Daenerys\u2019 costumes until season 7 </b>(<a href=\"http://lostlittlesatellites.tumblr.com/post/179678685367/fire-and-blood\">x</a>)<b>.</b></h2><p>Sansa\u2019s personal iconography during the early seasons consists primarily of three symbols: the Dragonfly, the Butterfly and the Moth, though the Rose makes a very brief appearance in one of her season 1 dresses: the lavender Tourney dress that is very much connected with her romanticism and her love for the ideals of Chilvaric romance (I\u2019ve covered that subject <a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/167245522589/winterfells-daughter-on-sansa-stark-part-5\">here</a>). However, unlike the Rose, the Moth, the Butterfly and the Dragonfly remain consistent symbols within Sansa\u2019s personal iconography across 5 seasons.The question is: what do these animals represent in relation to Sansa\u2019s character and her narrative arc?</p><h2>The Dragonfly</h2><p>The Dragonfly is, IMO, Sansa\u2019s primary symbol during the early seasons since it is the one she wears the most.\u00a0The first time we see Sansa associated with the Dragonfly is in the second episode of season 1 where the Starks and the royal family are travelling on the King\u2019s Road towards King\u2019s Landing. Here, the dragonfly appears in the form of a delicate silver necklace.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"2788\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/79eeaeb1996d695684a2ee2c134b4afe/tumblr_inline_plpk4zabFL1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"2788\"></figure><p>Later in season 1, the dragonfly also appears on Sansa\u2019s light blue kimono dress, which she wears when she pleads for her father\u2019s life.

This is where we have to be careful in our interpretations because when it comes to symbolism, multiple meanings exists, which all comes down to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragonfly#In_culture\">different cultural contexts</a>. Thus, the dragonfly is generally a positive symbol in Eastern and Native American folklore where it is associated with courage, strength, good luck and happiness. In European folklore and etymology, however, the dragonfly has more negative associations where it is associated with witchcraft as well as elves and fairies (<a href=\"http://www.crystalinks.com/dragonfly.html\">x</a>). These negative association was apparently due to its shape:</p><blockquote><p><i>\n\nThe reason why dragonflies inspire for the most part, negative myths, is believed to be due to their body shape which looks like a needle at the end (in fact, one of their nicknames is \u2018Devil\u2019s Darning Needle\u2019), their erratic flight patterns and their shimmering wings.</i> (<a href=\"https://theuijunkie.com/dragonfly-name-origin/\">x</a>)<br></p></blockquote><p>Then there\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.ask-angels.com/spiritual-guidance/dragonfly-meaning/\">New Age philosophy</a>, which has given the dragonfly new, primarily positive and spiritual connotations like hope, change and love (<a href=\"https://dragonflytransitions.com/why-the-dragonfly/\">x</a>). What is especially interesting in the context of GRRM\u2019s story is the fact that dragonflies were also associated with dragons in Western folklore:<br></p><blockquote><p><i>\n\nOne of the earliest reference to the name \u2018dragonfly\u2019 is on the book Sylva Sylvarum, or a Naturall Historie: In Ten Centuries (Classic Reprint) by Francis Bacon \u2013 an indeed fascinating read on ancient teachings, observations and experiments. Even though we can\u2019t be 100% sure, it\u2019s widely believed that Bacon picked up on a very common folklore name that was used at the time. And this should come as no surprise as <b>dragonflies were widely used in folklore throughout the world and it was believed that they once were dragons</b>.</i> (<a href=\"https://theuijunkie.com/dragonfly-name-origin/\">x</a>)<br></p></blockquote><p>Within the universe that GRRM has established for his story, there is a historical character called the <a href=\"http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Duncan_Targaryen\">Prince of Dragonflies</a>, Duncan Targaryen who gave up the throne for the love. The Prince of Dragonflies and his lady love, <a href=\"http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Jenny_of_Oldstones\">Jenny of Oldstones</a>, is the subject of at least one romantic song - and in this respect the dragonfly is connected with the songs of romance that the young and innocent Sansa loves so dearly. <b>Does this mean that Sansa\u2019s dragonfly motif in the show is meant to refer to the story of the Prince of Dragonflies? </b>I honestly don\u2019t know. While Michele Clapton has read the books (<a href=\"https://latimesblogs.latimes.com/showtracker/2012/03/creative-minds-game-of-thrones-costume-designer-michele-clapton.html\">x</a>) and spoken with GRRM (<a href=\"https://www.spin.com/2013/05/game-of-thrones-costume-designer-michele-clapton-interview-hbo/\">x</a>), I haven\u2019t been able to find any quotes of hers about Sansa\u2019s dragonflies.</p><p>Since Michele Clapton hasn\u2019t spoken about her use of the dragonfly motif, it is important to be careful when ascribing it a specific symbolic meaning. However, in general, the dragonfly is most often associated with transformation since it is a <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/metamorphosis\">metamorphic</a> creature that undergoes a pupate stage before it emerges in its adult form with the beautiful iridescent wings. <b>The dragonfly as a symbol of transformation is incredibly apt when it comes to the narrative arc of Sansa Stark - she is constantly forced to adapt and change by external circumstances.</b> At the same time the fragile beauty of the adult dragonfly is also a very fitting image for Sansa\u2019s youthful beauty when she\u2019s a captive in the early seasons. <i>The dragonfly as a general symbol of transformation is also supported by the use of moths and butterflies as secondary symbols in her personal iconography.</i></p><p>If the dragonfly mainly symbolizes transformation in Sansa\u2019s personal iconography then it is no coincidence that the symbol first appear after she\u2019s left Winterfell - since this is really the point where her narrative journey starts to gain momentum. This is this very beginning of first transformation; from Northern girl to Southern lady - but that is just the first of her many transformations.</p><h2>The Moth and the Butterfly</h2><p>Moths and butterflies are secondary symbols in Sansa\u2019s personal iconography. In season 1, Sansa wears ring in what looks to be the shape of a moth, at least the ragged edges of the wings suggest a moth rather than a butterfly.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"2788\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e8b0703b2fa1952bffa1e2e1c5b97cd8/tumblr_inline_plpk3zSByP1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"2788\"></figure><p>In season 3, a necklace with either a butterfly or a moth motif is introduced - as are set of bodice clasps that either looks like moth wings or a type of helicopter seed pods (<a href=\"https://www.bustle.com/articles/85163-sansa-starks-fashion-evolution-through-game-of-thrones-and-how-her-wardrobe-mirrors-her-character\">x)</a>.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"1632\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/670235b26228a8750094a0d9b4ee27e8/tumblr_inline_pm55vbAijg1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"1632\"></figure><p>If these claps are meant to represent helicopter seed pods rather than moth/butterfly wings, then the question is this: are they meant to be decorative or symbolic? And if they are symbolic, what do they symbolize? In general terms, seed pods represent the continuation of the life cycle of they tree they come from - they fly away, fall to the ground where they lie dormant during winter until it is time put forth the first tendrils of a new plant when spring arrives. So in a sense, the seed pods of Sansa\u2019s claps can be said to signify growth and change just like the dragonfly.</p><p>The symbolism of both moths and butterflies varies vastly in accordance with cultural context - while there\u2019s some overlap between certain cultures, other cultures ascribe these creatures very different meanings (<a href=\"https://www.insects.orkin.com/ced/issue-4/lepidopteral-symbolism/list-1/\">x</a>, <a href=\"https://www.insects.orkin.com/ced/issue-4/lepidopteral-symbolism/list-2/\">x</a>) - not to mention the meanings that New Age philosophy ascribes to these creatures (<a href=\"http://mothsymbolism.com/\">x</a>). <b>There is NO universal symbolism of the butterfly and the moth!</b> Many of the meanings ascribed to them are culturally specific and it is important to be aware of this. I\u2019m not going to list the various symbolic meanings because there are a lot of them. Moths and butterflies belong to the same family of insects (lepidoptera). While butterflies are primarily diurnal (active during the day), moths are predominantly noctural (active at night) or crepuscular (active at twilight). Moths and butterflies sometimes have contrasting symbolic meanings and sometimes synonymous symbolic meanings, all dependent on cultural context.\u00a0</p><h2>However, in a very general sense, both moths and butterflies are symbols of transformation as they, like the dragonfly, are metamorphic creatures.\u00a0</h2><p>They are also delicate and fragile. However, just like in the case of the dragonfly, Clapton hasn\u2019t said anything about this motif - but considering that the certain parts of the symbolism of these winged creatures overlap with the dragonfly, I think it is safe to say that butterflies and moths serve the same symbolic function as the dragonfly - to signal metamorphosis and change. In this respect I agree completely with Freya Lilian Porteus:</p><blockquote><p><i>\n\nMoths, dragonflies, and butterflies are metamorphic creatures that, despite their visually flimsy allure and delicate nature, evolve and grow as they shift and change. I feel like they are a very apt metaphor for Sansa Stark, who, through her pain due to her fragile place in society as a woman, is never broken entirely. She only evolves and grows as she shifts and changes through self realization.</i> (<a href=\"https://www.bustle.com/articles/85163-sansa-starks-fashion-evolution-through-game-of-thrones-and-how-her-wardrobe-mirrors-her-character\">x</a>)<br></p></blockquote><p>Moths especially are also creatures that employ camouflage in order to hide from predators and can thus be said to signify adaptability, which is certainly a character trait that Sansa possesses - as she tries to avoid drawing attention to herself at Joffrey\u2019s court.</p><p>Throughout the show, <b>Sansa constantly has to adapt to her circumstances.</b> She evolves continually - <b>and like a dragonfly/moth/butterfly she repeatedly emerges from one chrysalis after the other - often signaled by a radical change of style in her costume.</b> As the story progresses the stylistic changes becomes more and more marked whereas they are more subtle and gradual during the early seasons.</p><h2><b>A GILDED CAGE - SANSA\u2019S WEDDING GOWN</b></h2><p>While all the costumes are narratively important in <i>Game of Thrones</i>, some costumes carry a greater narrative weight than others, often because they are loaded with symbolic value. This is the case of Sansa\u2019s wedding dress in season 3 since this garment is meant to be a visual manifestation of the way that the Lannisters take ownership of Sansa (and her claim to Winterfell) through her forced marriage to Tyrion Lannister.

There\u2019s a reason for this stark difference between the costumes because <b>whereas Sansa\u2019s purple dresses signal her removal from the influence of Cersei, the wedding dress is a statement of Lannister dominance over her person and her body.</b> The embroidery plays an especially important role in this context but I\u2019ll return to that subject of the embroidery later on. First I want to take closer look on the general silhouette of the dress as well as the fabric and the colour - because these elements also carry meaning.</p><p>This dress is a sort of curious combination of the voluminous skirt and a tight sleeveless bodice, which gives the whole ensemble a slightly unbalanced look. The skirt is wider and more voluminous than what is seen on other female characters at the royal court, so this isn\u2019t a dress that conforms to the local style. The skirt looks to be supported by some kind of armature underneath, very like the panniers at the hips that were used to create width in the skirts during the rococo style of the 18th century.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"2020\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/ba3077226f29cfc38fbc485bade376a8/tumblr_inline_pm5b7n4peK1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"2020\"></figure><p>The skirt also has a bit of a train and with the sleeveless bodice, the overall effect is of a dress that is a bit bottom-heavy. <b>The aesthetics of the gown is just slightly off and that is intentional.</b>\u00a0The lack of sleeves is an especially important detail according to the embroiderer:</p><blockquote><p>\n\n<i><b>For this dress, Michelle wanted it to be a confined, restricted bodice shape with bare, vulnerable arms. </b>She wanted an embroidered band that would wrap around the bodice and tell Sansa\u2019s life story.</i>\u00a0(Michele Carragher,\u00a0<a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwinteriscoming.net%2F2014%2F04%2F06%2Fmichele-carragher-michelle-clapton-on-the-secret-narratives-in-game-of-thrones-wardrobe%2F&amp;t=OTFlODRmN2VjOGNhMmE2MTc4YjY2YTZjMDAyMzE1YjFkODAzOTM5OCxqazZlM3QzTQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AYD5-STb8ovo6MvPS6P_ZLA&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Ftrinuviel.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F179869368779%2Fquotes-on-sansas-s3-wedding-dress&amp;m=1\">Winter Is Coming</a>)\n\n<br></p></blockquote><p>Thus, the lack of sleeves is meant to signify vulnerability, the bodice itself tight and restrictive, trapping Sansa in her dress. The skirt itself is a bit curious in that regard - <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mK0qwUAJ3xddgqxDZTxlodQ\">@caesarscat</a> <a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/181709643144/im-not-a-fashion-expert-i-love-fashion-and-keep\">suggests</a> that it is meant to create a more womanly shape for a bride that is still a child, and that is certainly a possibility. However, the volume of the skirt and the amount of fabric used (heavy brocade) must also make this dress heavy to walk in - it physically weighs her down as an external embodiment of how this whole situation weighs so heavily on her emotions.</p><p>The skirt also sports a very curious detail that contradicts the vulnerability of the bare arms. The panniers of dress is enhanced with pieces of metal (looks like bronze) with a chased pattern of plant-like arabesques.\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"2304\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/c7fa527720d4a64d6710c8ddfadd259e/tumblr_inline_plpk9z2mDz1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"2304\"></figure><p>This is eerily similar to Cersei\u2019s armoured dress from season 2. Cersei literally wore armour when she felt threatened and thus these pieces of metal also evoke Sansa\u2019s dictum of<i> Courtesy is a lady\u2019s armour</i>. So while the dress primarily works as a bodily trap, restricting Sansa\u2019s movements and metaphorically exposing her vulnerable position, it also contains this tiny hint of Sansa\u2019s preferred form of passive resistance: Her use of politesse as a form of emotional armour where she keeps people at arms length, refusing to let them see how she feels - a technique she uses on Tyrion in the <a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/182045002204/winterfells-daughter-on-sansa-stark-part-15\">scene</a> right before the wedding ceremony.</p><p>I\u2019ve previously pointed out how Sansa\u2019s season 3 costumes signal a remove from the Lannister influence, particularly Cersei\u2019s. The wedding dress is a conspicuous re-assertion of that influence, but now in the form of dominance rather than emulation. The deep purple colours have been replaced with a shiny, gold-accented brocade very like the fabrics used for Cersei\u2019s and Joffrey\u2019s costumes.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"2020\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/5017cb44691438263be4069a938297cd/tumblr_inline_plsuar1XCy1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"2020\"></figure><p>The fastening of the bodice has also reverted to the side-flap that characterized her kimono dresses, which were emulating Cersei\u2019s season 1 look.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"1088\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/aba6f39bbb4e75b25d59f727d6c96d42/tumblr_inline_plsubdYC6t1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"1088\"></figure><p>At the same time, the wedding dress contains a very subtle callback to Sansa\u2019s Tourney dress from season one since the base colour of the gold-accented brocade is a pale lavender very similar to the season 1 dress. In a way, the use of the lavender colour is a cruel appropriation of this romantic dress (which incidentally also sports an embroidered direwolf like the wedding dress). The Tourney dress represent Sansa\u2019s romanticism and her love of Chivalric Romance (<a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/167245522589/winterfells-daughter-on-sansa-stark-part-5\">x</a>) - but now that romanticism has been put into a golden Lannister cage where marriage is not a union of lovers but a cynic power move against her family.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"3187\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/512df38cef63fa5384b85c2c61954a44/tumblr_inline_plpk7cy2fZ1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"3187\"></figure><p>Another thing I noticed upon my re-watch of the wedding scene is how Sansa\u2019s dress visually matches Joffrey\u2019s opulent costume in terms of both colour and fabric. I\u2019ve <a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/179909400489/the-rose-of-highgarden-on-margaery-tyrell-part\">previously written</a> about how matching clothes can be used to convey political and familial unity in the case of the Tyrells. In this case, however, the visual match between Sansa\u2019s and Joffrey\u2019s costumes signals domination rather than unity.\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"1352\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/dd756141668ca9bfdbac5291b1c54cb8/tumblr_inline_plsucgu0AU1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"1352\"></figure><p>In this context, the way that Sansa\u2019s and Tyrion\u2019s costumes don\u2019t match is also meaningful. While Sansa is wearing gold-and-lavender brocade, Tyrion is wearing a tunic in oxblood leather. They clash visually, standing next to each other at the altar. However, after Sansa has been garbed in the red-gold Lannister bridal cloak, the dark red accent of the cloak suddenly makes her costume match Tyrion\u2019s. Once again, this is not a visual statement of unity but rather of domination. With the cloaking of the bride, Tyrion (and through him House Lannister) takes possession of Sansa. She is now their property, bound to them permanently through the bonds of matrimony.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1982\" data-orig-height=\"724\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b038f639170cbf98e71cf7a112f7ce7b/tumblr_inline_plpkqcrdwL1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1982\" data-orig-height=\"724\"></figure><p>Sansa\u2019s wedding costume also includes another element that harks back to her earlier romantic self - the lion medallion that Joffrey gave her as a love token in season 1 (he was insincere but to Sansa it was a gesture straight out of the chivalric romances she loved so much). Now this symbol of romantic love has been subverted into yet another message of domination, of ownership.</p><h2>Embroidery</h2><p>As we can see, the shape, the fabric and the colour of a costume can carry a lot of meaning. However, Clapton adds yet another narrative layer in the form of an embroidered band that wraps around the bodice and acts as a symbolic cage in the same manner that the dress itself functions as a material cage that envelops and restricts Sansa\u2019s body. Clapton uses embroidery extensively in her costume design as a narrative element:</p><blockquote><p>\n\n<i>\u201c<b>The embroidery is a subliminal way to tell someone\u2019s story</b>,\u201d says Michele Clapton</i> (<a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hollywoodreporter.com%2Fnews%2Fgame-thrones-costume-designers-reveal-705873&amp;t=ZjA0NGY0NWQ5MzQ4OGVlMjg5NWI3ZTUxOTY4ZjI3Mzc3ZmFmNTA3MyxqazZlM3QzTQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AYD5-STb8ovo6MvPS6P_ZLA&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Ftrinuviel.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F179869368779%2Fquotes-on-sansas-s3-wedding-dress&amp;m=1\">Hollywood Reporter</a>)\n\n<br></p></blockquote><p>When it comes to the embroidery Clapton co-operates with the embroiderer Michele Carragher, who creates countless beaded embellishments for the costumes of the show. In the case of Sansa\u2019s wedding dress, Clapton and Carragher designed a piece of embroidery that uses the heraldry of several noble Houses to tell the story of Sansa\u2019s parentage and her subsequent entrapment by the Lannisters.\u00a0Thus, the entire piece makes up a story in itself, written across the body of an unwilling child-bride.\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>\n\n<i>\u201c<b>Obviously we imagined that the wedding dress has been commissioned by Cersei and the Lannisters for Sansa, and so the embroidery would have come from Cersei\u2019s mind.</b> We guessed that it wouldn\u2019t be romantic or lovely and girly and pretty with dainty flowers, but <b>a real strong message of dominance, saying that we own you now, Sansa.</b></i>\u00a0(Carragher,\u00a0<a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwinteriscoming.net%2F2014%2F04%2F06%2Fmichele-carragher-michelle-clapton-on-the-secret-narratives-in-game-of-thrones-wardrobe%2F&amp;t=OTFlODRmN2VjOGNhMmE2MTc4YjY2YTZjMDAyMzE1YjFkODAzOTM5OCxqazZlM3QzTQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AYD5-STb8ovo6MvPS6P_ZLA&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Ftrinuviel.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F179869368779%2Fquotes-on-sansas-s3-wedding-dress&amp;m=1\">Winter Is Coming</a>)\n\n<br></p></blockquote><p>The story starts at the back of the band with a symbolic representation of Sansa\u2019s parentage:</p><blockquote><p>\n\n<i>\u201cFor the wedding band, I started at the back of the waist with some <b>Stark direwolves and Tully fish entwined</b> that represent Sansa\u2019s parentage.\u201d\u00a0\n\n</i>(Carragher, <a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwinteriscoming.net%2F2014%2F04%2F06%2Fmichele-carragher-michelle-clapton-on-the-secret-narratives-in-game-of-thrones-wardrobe%2F&amp;t=OTFlODRmN2VjOGNhMmE2MTc4YjY2YTZjMDAyMzE1YjFkODAzOTM5OCxqazZlM3QzTQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AYD5-STb8ovo6MvPS6P_ZLA&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Ftrinuviel.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F179869368779%2Fquotes-on-sansas-s3-wedding-dress&amp;m=1\">Winter Is Coming</a>) \n\n<br></p></blockquote><figure data-orig-width=\"750\" data-orig-height=\"600\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/ffdc1a2fc2579860ad7fc060a2862c20/tumblr_inline_plpki2dkLB1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"750\" data-orig-height=\"600\"></figure><p>The band cross over itself on the front of the bodice where Carragher added the Lannister lion to the unfolding narrative:</p><blockquote><p>\n\n<i>\u201cThen, as we move to the side, <b>the Lannister lion is tangling with the direwolf and emerging on top</b>, representing Sansa being seduced and then controlled by members of the house of Lannister.

It was connected to the cult of<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inanna\"> Ishtar</a>/Innana, goddess of love, sex, fertility.</p><p>Throughout the Mediterranean, Near Eastern and Middle Eastern world, <b>the pomegranate</b> has been revered as <b>an ancient and potent symbol of fertility, regeneration and marriage</b>:</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cPeople use whatever is at hand to express their religious beliefs,\"says Frank A. Salamone, an authority on religious symbols and a professor at Iona College in New Rochelle, N.Y. Centuries ago, in the Fertile Crescent, where so many religions arose, the pomegranate was at hand. By its very nature, it lent itself to religious symbolism.<br></i></p><p><i>\"The pomegranate is red, and so is blood,\u201d Salamone says. \u201cIt has a lot of seeds and is an obvious symbol of fertility.\u201d It\u2019s beautiful, strong and delicate, and its juice has healing properties, he says. \u201cIt says a lot of different things all at once.

It\u2019s status as a symbol of fertility was most likely transmitted through a kind of cross-cultural pollination along with the tree as it was exported East to China and West to Egypt, Turkey, North Africa, Greece and Rome.</p><p>While it is a fertility symbol in many cultures, the fruit also became associated with Death and Resurrection in Greek and Roman mythology. Most famously in the <a href=\"http://itsallgreeklondon.wordpress.com/2014/10/29/the-significance-of-the-pomegranate-in-ancient-greece/\">myth of Persephone</a>, daughter of the fertility goddess Demeter. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persephone\">Persephone</a> was a vegetation goddess like Demeter but according to myth she was abducted by Hades, the God of the Underworld. Demeter went into mourning and all plant life died so Zeus commanded Hades to release her daughter. However, Hades had tricked Persephone into eating six pomegranate seeds and so she was forced to spend six months of the year as Queen of the Underworld and the remaining six months above ground as a goddess of spring. The myth of Persephone is essentially an allegorical retelling of the changing of the seasons - and thus <b>the pomegranate is not just connected to fertility</b> (spring) <b>but also</b> <b>to death</b> (winter) <b>and resurrection</b> (the re-emergence of spring).</p><p>However, the pomegranate as a symbol of death and resurrection is also connected to another mythical figure: Adonis, the lover of Venus, the Roman goddess of love and sex. In the <i>Metamorphoses</i>, the Roman poet Ovid recounts the tale of Adonis who is slain on a hunt and the grief-stricken Venus creates the anemone flower, red like a pomegranate in memory of him:</p><blockquote><p><i>When from the heights she saw the lifeless body lying in its own blood, she leapt down, tearing her clothes, and tearing at her hair as well, and beat at her breasts with fierce hands, complaining to the fates. \u201cAnd yet not everything is in your power\u201d she said. \u201cAdonis, there shall be an everlasting token of my grief, and every year an imitation of your death will complete a re-enactment of my mourning. <b>But your blood will be changed into a flower</b>\u2026\u201d So saying, she sprinkled the blood with odorous nectar: and, at the touch, it swelled up, as bubbles emerge in yellow mud. <b>In less than an hour, a flower, of the colour of blood, was created such as pomegranates carry, that hide their seeds under a tough rind.</b> But enjoyment of it is brief: for, lightly clinging, and too easily fallen, the winds deflower it, which are likewise responsible for its name, windflower: anemone</i>\u2019 (<a href=\"http://ovidsmetamorphoses.blogspot.com/2012/08/an-anemone-for-adonis.html\">Source</a>)</p></blockquote><p>According to myth, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adonis\">Adonis</a> was raised by Persephone in the Underworld - but the figure has much older roots in the Sumerian story of Innana and Dumuzid. Adonis is thus very likely connected to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dying-and-rising_deity\">Dying-and-Rising archetype</a>, which characterizes a number of male fertility gods in the Middle Eastern and Mediterranean region of during Antiquity.</p><p>Christianity also appropriated the symbolism of Fertility and Resurrection associated with the pomegranate into its iconography:</p><blockquote><p><i><b>\n\nIn Christian art the pomegranate</b>, often split\nand showing the seeds, <b>was interpreted as a\nsymbol of fertility, hope of immortality, and\nthe Resurrection</b>. The infant Jesus is frequently seen in paintings and sculpture presenting\nthe pomegranate to his mother. In the last of\nthe famous Unicorn tapestries at The Cloisters the symbolic meaning of marriage and fertility is illustrated by showing the Unicorn\nchained to the pomegranate tree, with the red\nseeds of a bursting fruit spilling on him.</i> (<a href=\"https://www.metmuseum.org/pubs/bulletins/1/pdf/3257268.pdf.bannered.pdf\">Hildegard Schneider</a>)<br></p></blockquote><p>So the pomegranates on Sansa\u2019s wedding dress has a very old and rich symbolic history - and <b>the connection between the pomegranate and fertility is very apt in this context since the Lannisters intend for Sansa to bear fruit in her marriage in the form of a Lannister-Stark child</b> through which they can claim the North.</p><p>Even more interesting is the fact that Sansa has her very own pomegranate symbolism in GRRM\u2019s text. After Petyr Baelish spirits Sansa away to the Fingers, he offers her pomegranates and other fruits during a private conversation where he\u2019s imparting his particular brand of wisdom:</p><blockquote><p><i>\n\nGrisel reappeared before he could say more, balancing a large platter. She set it down between them. There were apples and pears and pomegranates, some sad-looking grapes, a huge blood orange. The old woman had brought a round of bread as well, and a crock of butter. <b>Petyr cut a pomegranate in two with his dagger, offering half to Sansa.</b> \u201cYou should try and eat, my lady.\u201d \u201cThank you, my lord.\u201d <b>Pomegranate seeds were so messy; Sansa chose a pear instead</b>, and took a small delicate bite. It was very ripe. The juice ran down her chin.</i></p><p><i>\u2026</i></p><p><i>\u201cIn King\u2019s Landing, there are two sorts of people. The players and the pieces.\u201d\n\n<br></i></p><p><i>\n\n\u201cAnd I was a piece?\u201d She dreaded the answer.</i></p><p><i>\u201cYes, but don\u2019t let that trouble you. You\u2019re still half a child. Every man\u2019s a piece to start with, and every maid as well. Even some who think they are players.\u201d He ate another seed. \u201cCersei, for one. She thinks herself sly, but in truth she is utterly predictable. Her strength rests on her beauty, birth, and riches. Only the first of those is truly her own, and it will soon desert her. I pity her then. She wants power, but has no notion what to do with it when she gets it. <b>Everyone wants something, Alayne. And when you know what a man wants you know who he is, and how to move him</b>.\"\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u2026</i></p><p><i><b>\n\nLord Petyr</b> dismissed him with a wave, and <b>returned to the pomegranate again</b> as Oswell shuffled down the steps. \u201d<b>Tell me, Alayne\u2014which is more dangerous, the dagger brandished by an enemy, or the hidden one</b> pressed to your back by someone you never even see?\u201c</i></p><p><i>\"The hidden dagger.\u201d</i>\u00a0(ASoS, Sansa VI)\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>Baelish then starts to eat a blood orange as he continues to talk, steadily guiding Sansa through his machinations until she realizes that it was Olenna Tyrell who poisoned Joffrey:</p><blockquote><p><i>\n\nHe tilted his chin back and squeezed the blood orange, so the juice ran down into his mouth. \u201cI love the juice but I loathe the sticky fingers,\u201d he complained, wiping his hands. \u201c<b>Clean</b> <b>hands, Sansa. Whatever you do, make certain your hands are clean.</b>\u201d</i> (ASoS, Sansa VI)<br></p></blockquote><p>The conversation goes on as Baelish relates exactly how he manipulated the Tyrells into doing what he wanted.</p><p>This is not just a conversation over fruit where Baelish instructs his new pupil in the subtleties of the game of thrones. <b>It is a temptation scenario where he offers Sansa a fruit associated with temptation as he intends to mold her into his own image. </b>Like Hades, Baelish<b>\u00a0</b>tempts Sansa with the pomegranate but unlike Persephone, Sansa refuses the fruit.\u00a0</p><h2>Sansa REFUSES the pomegranate! This is very important because it foreshadows her eventually rejecting Baelish and his nefarious ambitions.</h2><p>This temptation scenario is lent even more symbolic weight if we consider the hypothesis that the Forbidden Fruit in the Garden of Eden might not have been an apple but a pomegranate! (<a href=\"https://iranian.com/2009/05/04/it-was-a-pomegranate-not-an-apple-depicted-in-the-biblical-garden-of-eden-part-i/\">x</a>) This interpretation is still somewhat controversial but if the Forbidden Fruit was indeed a pomegranate then the Temptation of Eve does have an interesting parallel with the Temptation of Persephone.</p><p>I have been unable to find any confirmation that the pomegranates on Sansa\u2019s wedding dress are meant to have a deeper meaning than an association to the Lannister red. However, Carragher develops her creations in collaboration with Clapton and she does quite a bit of historical research:</p><blockquote><p><i>\n\nFor \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d Carragher often spends as long thinking about a piece as she does making it. <b>First, she confers with Clapton about each character\u2019s narrative arc </b>and the costumes Clapton has designed for them. <b>Then Carragher does historical research</b> in museums near her home, in East London. After a month of planning, she ships her materials to the show\u2019s Belfast production studios, where she works six days a week, twelve hours a day, embellishing a season\u2019s worth of costumes.</i> (<a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/embroidering-game-of-thrones\">The NewYorker</a>)<br></p></blockquote><h2>Thus, it is not implausible that adorning a wedding dress with\u00a0an age old symbol of fertility and marriage is not entirely coincidental on the part of the designers!</h2></p>",

This post is the 17th installment in this series and the last one that deals with Sansa&rsquo;s season 3 arc.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>In this post, I&rsquo;m going to take a closer look at Sansa&rsquo;s costumes during the season with a special emphasis on her spectacular golden wedding gown since her season 3 arc revolves around her political value as Robb&rsquo;s heir apparent and there are several plots aimed at securing the Key to the North through marriage. It is also a costume that is inscribed with a lot of narrative and symbolic meaning that subtly enriches her story and her characterization.</p><p>Costume design is an integral aspect of the visual language of cinema and television - and especially on <i>Game of Thrones </i>since costume designer Michele Clapton approaches the costumes in terms of story-telling.</p><blockquote><p><i>I always try to <b>make the clothes visually tell something</b>.</i> (<a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.fidmmuseum.org%2Fmuseum%2F2018%2F09%2Finterview-with-game-of-thrones-costume-designer-michele-clapton.html&amp;t=NGI5YzYxY2NlMjQ3ZTFhMGJiMTRiZDY4NjkwNjBjMjdiNjZlYTQwOCx4eUJnV1ZaYg%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AYD5-STb8ovo6MvPS6P_ZLA&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Ftrinuviel.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F179909400489%2Fthe-rose-of-highgarden-on-margaery-tyrell-part&amp;m=1\">FIDM Museum Blog</a>) <br /></p><p><i>I always try to tell that story &mdash; <b>the costumes for me are narrative</b> and you should be able to look at them [the characters] and understand where they are mentally in their journey.</i> (<a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thisisinsider.com%2Fgame-of-thrones-costume-designer-michele-clapton-interview-2017-6&amp;t=NTIxNTlmMTQ5MDZmYmVlNjdjZWJhM2M0Y2VkMmQ5ZmI3NGI1NTZjMCx4eUJnV1ZaYg%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AYD5-STb8ovo6MvPS6P_ZLA&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Ftrinuviel.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F179909400489%2Fthe-rose-of-highgarden-on-margaery-tyrell-part&amp;m=1\">Insider</a>)</p><p>\n\n<i><b>I love to try and indicate the emotional state of characters through their costumes, and also to indicate their influence over other characters and courts. </b>Sometimes this says so much more than words.</i> (<a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.spin.com%2F2013%2F05%2Fgame-of-thrones-costume-designer-michele-clapton-interview-hbo%2F&amp;t=NWMzN2ExM2MzZGU4YjY5NjIzYmExOWY4MzY4NGE2ZDU3YTgxM2NiZCxqazZlM3QzTQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AYD5-STb8ovo6MvPS6P_ZLA&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Ftrinuviel.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F179869368779%2Fquotes-on-sansas-s3-wedding-dress&amp;m=1\">SPIN</a>)\n\n<br /></p></blockquote><p>Thus, the costumes are incredibly important in this show and it is worth paying attention to them because every single detail is meaningful:</p><blockquote><p>\n\n<i><b>Everything &ndash; even a fashion choice &ndash; has meaning on &ldquo;Game of Thrones.&rdquo; </b>In this cutthroat world where men fight for the Iron Throne and the women yield a different kind of power, <b>a choice of fabric or a different cut of cloth can be a political statement, costume designer Michele Clapton told TODAY.com</b></i><b>.</b>(<a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.today.com%2Fstyle%2Fwhat-expect-costumes-season-3-game-thrones-1C9143460&amp;t=YTMwZTU5MjllNmQ3NTU4MjAzYzI2Y2I1NjBkZjMxYWY3YTUxNDEwOSxqazZlM3QzTQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AYD5-STb8ovo6MvPS6P_ZLA&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Ftrinuviel.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F179869368779%2Fquotes-on-sansas-s3-wedding-dress&amp;m=1\">Today</a>)\n\n<br /></p></blockquote><p>Even in real life, clothing has always had symbolic and communicative value through which people signal social and cultural positions. In short, fashion and dress codes place people within a given culture. <i>Garments function as non-verbal signs that&nbsp;that can be interpreted differently depending on the context, situation or culture </i>(<a href=\"http://theministeroffashion.com/semiotics-of-fashion/\">x</a>). That is doubly so for costume design since it its entire raison d&rsquo;etre is to support and enrich the story that is told.</p><h2><b>THE SARTORIAL EVOLUTION OF SANSA STARK</b></h2><p>As said, Sansa&rsquo;s golden wedding dress will be the primary focus of this post - both because of its symbolic value but also because it is markedly different from the rest of her costumes during season 3. However, before I start analyzing the wedding dress it will be instructive to take a look at how she generally dresses during season 3 because the colour, cut and embellishment of the wedding dress stands in stark contrast to the rest of her costumes.</p><p>The costumes are an important part of the story-telling but they are an especially important part of Sansa&rsquo;s character since she&rsquo;s the only character that is repeatedly shown to make her own clothes! This is something that Michele Clapton emphasizes in several interviews:</p><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;She expresses herself through her ability to embroider and stitch,&rdquo; Clapton told Buzzfeed. <b>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve always used that as something that Sansa expresses her feelings through&mdash;her embroidery and depictions on her costumes, and through shade and color.&rdquo; </b></i>(<a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.looper.com%2F103763%2Fhidden-meanings-behind-costumes-game-thrones%2F&amp;t=MTkzZTdkZDU1MTg5YTY0MTM5YjFmZmQ5NGZiMjZhYmVkOTE4NDBmMyxqazZlM3QzTQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AYD5-STb8ovo6MvPS6P_ZLA&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Ftrinuviel.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F179869368779%2Fquotes-on-sansas-s3-wedding-dress&amp;m=1\">Looper</a>)</p><p><i><b>Costume is important to Sansa&mdash;she sees it as a way of communicating with people, to show her aspirations.

The Starks represent a warm family unit, so the blues of their costumes are rather warm. But within the family, the various personalities are reflected in what they wear. For example, Sansa is in a slightly cooler blue.</i>&nbsp;(<a href=\"http://costumevault.blogspot.com/2016/08/creating-seven-kingdoms-part-i-north.html\">CostumeVault</a>)&nbsp;<br /></p></blockquote><p>\n\nInterestingly, Clapton also uses this light blue as a way to emphasize that Sansa is somewhat out of sync with the rest of her family. This becomes especially clear when the Starks line up to greet King Robert in the first episode. While the rest of the Starks are dressed in dark blues and greys, Sansa is exclusively dressed in the light baby blue - even the fur on her cloak is light blue! This makes Sansa stand out like a sore thumb among the Stark household. Considering how Clapton approaches costume design in terms of both story-telling and characterization, this choice is no coincidence.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/1ae989bb84840e764d4cf194c0f966a1/tumblr_inline_plqz3kMnvC1uklhai_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>She is, in a sense, a bit isolated within in her own family given how none of her siblings share her interests, not to mention that gender norms also play a role in relation to this issue (<a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/166994576194/winterfells-daughter-on-sansa-stark-part-1\">x</a>). While this isn&rsquo;t something that the show really delves into at the level of the text, the costuming clearly articulates a sense of isolation within the family when it comes to Sansa - and that is probably one of the reasons why she&rsquo;s so excited to travel to King&rsquo;s Landing.<br /></p><p>Sansa&rsquo;s costumes changes when she arrives in King&rsquo;s Landing. A significant costume is the lavender dress that she first wears at the Hand&rsquo;s Tourney. This dress represents a sartorial amalgam of the Northern and the King&rsquo;s Landing style. The lavender colour occupy a mid-point between Sansa&rsquo;s Northern blue and the dusty rose colours that the women wear at the court in King&rsquo;s Landing. However, the fabric is similar to her Northern dress and the embroidery not only includes her House Sigil (the Direwolf) but the leafy vines that climb the sides of the dress are rather similar to the embroidery on her Winterfell feast dress (picture at the far right in the collage below)</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/5472c9776e9b0e1c4e754ddffd4796db/tumblr_inline_plpk1lMVAe1uklhai_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>The most conspicuous detail is the neckline, which is not only significantly lower than her Northern dresses but it is also embellished with cloth roses - an completely new element in Sansa&rsquo;s personal iconography (<a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/167245522589/winterfells-daughter-on-sansa-stark-part-5\">x</a>). This dress also marks the beginning of Sansa&rsquo;s slow transition from a child to a young girl at the cusp of maidenhood.</p><p>Later in the season, Sansa&rsquo;s Northern dresses are completely discarded - and she is now dressed in the kimono-style of light-weight fabric like the ones that Cersei wears.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/f8c9de4d607ca3c3e520a6742b3297f2/tumblr_inline_plpiduhHqw1uklhai_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>However, it is also important to note that she only starts wearing these Cersei-inspired costumes after she has fallen completely within the power of the Lannisters.</p><blockquote><p>\n\n<i>Where a character comes from is indicated through the color and cut of the costume.<b> </b>When we first see Sansa [Sophie Turner], she wears things in a Stark way &mdash; very well, but they are slightly clumsy and the cloth is rather homespun.

She is completely at the mercy of the Lannisters - utterly dependent on their&nbsp;&ldquo;mercy&rdquo; while she at the same time desperately tries to save her father. It is no coincidence that she&rsquo;s wearing her blue kimono dress when she publicly begs for her father&rsquo;s life and the rose kimono-dress at his public confession (that she thought would save his life) as well as later on when Joffrey forces her to look at Ned Stark&rsquo;s severed head.&nbsp;</p><p><b><i>When</i> a costume is worn within the narrative is just as important as how it looks.</b></p><h2>Season 2</h2><p>Sansa has a fewer costumes in season 2.

These are garments that she wears in the privacy of her chambers. She may wear Southern style dress in court, but in private she wears garments that remind her of her home. The fact that she wears a garment connected to her home and her childhood in the scene where she gets her first period is also significant. The onset of menses is part of her physical maturation, she is no longer a child in the eyes of some people - and in the very next scene, she and Cersei discuss motherhood.&nbsp;</p><p>After this scene, her fashion style changes dramatically. Her final costume in season 2 is radically different from the earlier ones - both in colour and in shape. Sansa debuts a dress in a deep purple patterned with wine-leaves, with long trailing sleeves and paired with a golden belt. It fits her much better than the previous kimono dresses and it closed in the front but opens at the neckline and the skirt to showcase an under-dress or a long scarf.<br /></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d2ab42161e785304eb1b516b9f73609d/tumblr_inline_plsulrNIZo1uklhai_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>This is not the dress of a child but of a young woman. However, t<b>his style also signals a&nbsp;conscious removal from the style of Cersei but neither is it a retreat into the style of her childhood.</b> This dress is extremely similar to what Sansa&rsquo;s mother Catelyn Stark wears - it is, in fact, the exact same silhouette as the gowns worn by the Lady Stark. She has also changed her hair style.</p><p>In season 1, Sansa started to adopt the intricate hairstyles made popular by Cersei Lannister - it is even directly commented on by Septa Mordane.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/101fd069ef394ed7dba97631ccff777d/tumblr_inline_plr4pcn5w11uklhai_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>During season 2, Sansa still wears her hair in this way when she&rsquo;s in public. However, in the episode of the Battle of the Blackwater, Sansa debuts a whole new style, both in dress and in the way she wears her hair, in public - and like her dress, Sansa&rsquo;s new hair style is modelled on her mother.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/f9070b0da42c1c19f9c25ed2386c2aac/tumblr_inline_plr4oeikIo1uklhai_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>It isn&rsquo;t completely identical but the basic elements are the same: the side-locks are pulled away from the face, slight twisted and fastened behind the head.

In the books, Sansa rejects Cersei&rsquo;s&nbsp;&ldquo;wisdom&rdquo; internally but since we don&rsquo;t get that inner monologue on the screen, the it is left to the costuming to visually express this rejection rejection of Cersei&rsquo;s influence.</p><h2>Season 3</h2><p>In season 3, the purple dress with the wine-leaf pattern not only makes a re-appearance, it also serves as the template for the rest of Sansa&rsquo;s wardrobe, apart from her wedding dress, which is in a radically different style than the rest of her season 3 dresses.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/a92d1f45d36aec8a3ab7fa2a48a03ce9/tumblr_inline_plsqgoVs3H1uklhai_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Apart from her wedding dress, all of Sansa&rsquo;s costumes are in various shades of purple.

In fact, <b>Catelyn Stark wears a similar dress in the exact same fabric</b> but in a different colour!</p><p>In general, Sansa&rsquo;s season 3 costumes also marks a beginning towards a darker palette. Whereas she wore garments in light blues, light lavender and light rose during seasons 1-2, in season 3 almost all of her dresses fall within the darker spectrum of the purple colours like dark magenta, amethyst and blue violet. <b>Clapton likes to use colour symbolically</b>:</p><blockquote><p><i>According to Clapton, color plays a pivotal role in foreshadowing characters&rsquo; futures. <b>&ldquo;We do all these sort of secret symbols, color hints about the ways the court is being influenced,&rdquo; says Clapton.</b>&rdquo; They are just little things that people may not notice unless they really look.&ldquo; We asked for examples but got no specifics. Instead Clapton hints again: &ldquo;You can see the people who are getting the power by the way the court starts to dress. It&rsquo;s just a small thing, a color here and there and it slowly escalates. I think it&rsquo;s really important to do that because people tend to watch these episodes over and over again and later on box sets. So it&rsquo;s important that you don&rsquo;t get everything on the first viewing.&rdquo;</i>(<a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hollywoodreporter.com%2Fnews%2Fgame-thrones-season-3-costume-designer-michele-clapton-reveals-subtle-color-clues-video-431029&amp;t=YTg3NzhmNDJjZDRiM2QyNWY5YjViZmY2ZmM3ZTBiZjkyZmJlMjYyMixqazZlM3QzTQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AYD5-STb8ovo6MvPS6P_ZLA&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Ftrinuviel.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F179869368779%2Fquotes-on-sansas-s3-wedding-dress&amp;m=1\">The Hollywood Reporter</a>)</p></blockquote><p><b>So I can&rsquo;t help but wonder what Sansa&rsquo;s dark purple dresses are meant to signify. </b>In terms of colour theory, purple is an intermediate colour between red and blue, and in this context it is interesting that the two women who exerts the most influence over Sansa wears either deep red (Cersei) or light blue (Margaery). So the purple of Sansa&rsquo;s gowns may signal that she&rsquo;s influenced by very different people:</p><blockquote><p>\n\n<i><b>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s still young and vulnerable&ndash;she&rsquo;s always influenced by the people around her,&rdquo; Clapton said. </b>&ldquo;Without saying too much, she befriends someone new. She starts to dress a bit like her&ndash;so <b>she&rsquo;s still being pulled and influenced and she&rsquo;s not really her own person yet.&rdquo;</b></i> (<a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Ffashionista.com%2F2013%2F03%2Fgame-of-thrones-costumer-designer-gives-us-the-dirt-on-season-3&amp;t=YTIwM2FhYjNlZmU3MzUyNDIxMGMyZTc5YmE2MjE0NDJhOWJmNGYyNyxqazZlM3QzTQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AYD5-STb8ovo6MvPS6P_ZLA&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Ftrinuviel.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F179869368779%2Fquotes-on-sansas-s3-wedding-dress&amp;m=1\">Fashionista</a>)\n\n<br /></p></blockquote><p>However, the colour purple also has a number of <a href=\"https://www.six-degrees.com/pdf/International-Color-Symbolism-Chart.pdf\">symbolic meanings</a>. In some cultures&nbsp;<b>purple is associated with death, mourning and endurance of suffering</b> - and that certainly fits well with Sansa&rsquo;s narrative arc so far. But the colour <b>purple also has a long history as a sign of wealth, luxury and royalty!</b> The association between purple and royalty is particularly interesting in this case because season 3 includes a detail about Sansa that may foreshadow her becoming royalty, i.e. the ringing of the bells at her birth (<a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/180902951614/winterfells-daughter-on-sansa-stark-part-11\">x</a>).&nbsp;Speaking of the use of colour as foreshadowing, I would be amiss not to mention the infamous Purple Wedding that takes place in season 4 and in which Sansa unwittingly plays a part by carrying a poison in the form of amethyst crystals. Incidentally, she wears purple at that feast as well.</p><p>While Sansa dresses like her mother in a visual repudiation of Cersei Lannister, her appearance is also subtly influenced by a new person in her orbit.<br /></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/c0184083bb888a36a55d586af35edaee/tumblr_inline_plspih3CJF1uklhai_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Queen-to-be Margaery Tyrell befriends Sansa, first in order to learn what kind of person Joffrey is (<a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/181688895069/winterfells-daughter-on-sansa-stark-part-12\">x</a>) and later as part of a plot to marry Sansa to her brother Loras Tyrell in an effort to secure Sansa&rsquo;s claim to Winterfell for House Tyrell (<a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/181784314164/winterfells-daughter-on-sansa-stark-part-13\">x</a>).</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/eec3dcec611bdb5f85dc3b4814fda64f/tumblr_inline_plspq7L37m1uklhai_540.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Thus, after Margaery has made friends with Sansa (and after the secret bethrothal has been agreed up), Sansa begins to wear her hair like her new friend. Petyr Baelish notices this and comments upon it when Sansa politely rejects his offer to spirit her away from the capital. This is, incidentally, the second time that the style of Sansa&rsquo;s hair is directly referred to in the show - because when it comes to Sansa, her hair styles always communicate something! Here, it subtly signals her new alliance with the Tyrells (as well as Margaery&rsquo;s growing influence over the royal court). Throughout the seasons, we&rsquo;ll see how not only Sansa&rsquo;s clothes but also her hair is inscribed with meaning.</p><h2><b>DRAGONFLIES, BUTTERFLIES AND MOTHS - SANSA&rsquo;S PERSONAL ICONOGRAPHY</b></h2><p>Michele Clapton&rsquo;s costume design is, as said, always narratively important - and every little detail has meaning:</p><blockquote><p>\n\n<i>&ldquo;People don&rsquo;t necessarily see this,&rdquo; admitted Clapton. But, it&rsquo;s still worth the work: &ldquo;For us,<b> it&rsquo;s to have that depth in all of the costumes.

Clapton almost always uses jewellery and embroidery symbolically - the most obvious examples being Cersei&rsquo;s lion embossed necklaces and lion embroidered gowns to Daenerys&rsquo; dragon jewels and scaly embellishments and <a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/179909400489/the-rose-of-highgarden-on-margaery-tyrell-part\">Margaery&rsquo;s delicate roses</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Sansa also has her own personal iconography, which is expressed through the embroidery on her clothes and the jewellery she wears. However, (unlike Cersei, Daenerys and Margaery), Sansa&rsquo;s personal iconography in the early seasons are not rooted in her House sigil (though the direwolf does grace one of her season 1 dresses). <b>Thus, her iconography is more about Sansa&rsquo;s personal journey rather than her family identity, which is also her political identity </b>- though this changes during the later seasons. <b>This reflects both Sansa&rsquo;s initial desire to leave her family hom</b>e, to become part of a larger world <b>but later on, it can also be seen as an expression of how her political/familial identity becomes a liability for her at Joffrey&rsquo;s court </b>where she is brutally punished for her brother&rsquo;s victories. In this context, it is noteworthy that the Stark direwolves only make a brief appearance on her clothing when she is forcibly married to Tyrion Lannister - and here, her familial/political identity is exploited by the enemies of her house.<b>The Stark direwolf only makes a definitive return in season 6 and 7 when Sansa has finally escaped her enemies and embarks upon a quest to reclaim her family seat, emerging victorious as the Lady of Winterfell.</b>&nbsp;</p><h2><b>In that sense, the withholding of the Stark direwolf from her costuming is just as meaningful as Clapton&rsquo;s choice to withhold the Targaryen red from Daenerys&rsquo; costumes until season 7 </b>(<a href=\"http://lostlittlesatellites.tumblr.com/post/179678685367/fire-and-blood\">x</a>)<b>.</b></h2><p>Sansa&rsquo;s personal iconography during the early seasons consists primarily of three symbols: the Dragonfly, the Butterfly and the Moth, though the Rose makes a very brief appearance in one of her season 1 dresses: the lavender Tourney dress that is very much connected with her romanticism and her love for the ideals of Chilvaric romance (I&rsquo;ve covered that subject <a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/167245522589/winterfells-daughter-on-sansa-stark-part-5\">here</a>). However, unlike the Rose, the Moth, the Butterfly and the Dragonfly remain consistent symbols within Sansa&rsquo;s personal iconography across 5 seasons.The question is: what do these animals represent in relation to Sansa&rsquo;s character and her narrative arc?</p><h2>The Dragonfly</h2><p>The Dragonfly is, IMO, Sansa&rsquo;s primary symbol during the early seasons since it is the one she wears the most.&nbsp;The first time we see Sansa associated with the Dragonfly is in the second episode of season 1 where the Starks and the royal family are travelling on the King&rsquo;s Road towards King&rsquo;s Landing. Here, the dragonfly appears in the form of a delicate silver necklace.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/79eeaeb1996d695684a2ee2c134b4afe/tumblr_inline_plpk4zabFL1uklhai_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Later in season 1, the dragonfly also appears on Sansa&rsquo;s light blue kimono dress, which she wears when she pleads for her father&rsquo;s life. This dress reappears in season 2, when she wears it during her dinner with Cersei, Myrcella and Tommen (x) and in the scene where Joffrey has her publicly beaten (<a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/175216924789/winterfells-daughter-on-sansa-stark-part-7\">x</a>), along with the necklace. The dress is destroyed in that scene - but the dragonfly necklace reappears over seasons 1-3 until it is left behind in season 4.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/41a185dba2f211ca69d919bb66b04334/tumblr_inline_plpk5lEUcW1uklhai_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>So what does the Dragonfly symbolise? This is where we have to be careful in our interpretations because when it comes to symbolism, multiple meanings exists, which all comes down to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragonfly#In_culture\">different cultural contexts</a>. Thus, the dragonfly is generally a positive symbol in Eastern and Native American folklore where it is associated with courage, strength, good luck and happiness. In European folklore and etymology, however, the dragonfly has more negative associations where it is associated with witchcraft as well as elves and fairies (<a href=\"http://www.crystalinks.com/dragonfly.html\">x</a>). These negative association was apparently due to its shape:</p><blockquote><p><i>\n\nThe reason why dragonflies inspire for the most part, negative myths, is believed to be due to their body shape which looks like a needle at the end (in fact, one of their nicknames is &lsquo;Devil&rsquo;s Darning Needle&rsquo;), their erratic flight patterns and their shimmering wings.</i> (<a href=\"https://theuijunkie.com/dragonfly-name-origin/\">x</a>)<br /></p></blockquote><p>Then there&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.ask-angels.com/spiritual-guidance/dragonfly-meaning/\">New Age philosophy</a>, which has given the dragonfly new, primarily positive and spiritual connotations like hope, change and love (<a href=\"https://dragonflytransitions.com/why-the-dragonfly/\">x</a>). What is especially interesting in the context of GRRM&rsquo;s story is the fact that dragonflies were also associated with dragons in Western folklore:<br /></p><blockquote><p><i>\n\nOne of the earliest reference to the name &lsquo;dragonfly&rsquo; is on the book Sylva Sylvarum, or a Naturall Historie: In Ten Centuries (Classic Reprint) by Francis Bacon &ndash; an indeed fascinating read on ancient teachings, observations and experiments. Even though we can&rsquo;t be 100% sure, it&rsquo;s widely believed that Bacon picked up on a very common folklore name that was used at the time. And this should come as no surprise as <b>dragonflies were widely used in folklore throughout the world and it was believed that they once were dragons</b>.</i> (<a href=\"https://theuijunkie.com/dragonfly-name-origin/\">x</a>)<br /></p></blockquote><p>Within the universe that GRRM has established for his story, there is a historical character called the <a href=\"http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Duncan_Targaryen\">Prince of Dragonflies</a>, Duncan Targaryen who gave up the throne for the love. The Prince of Dragonflies and his lady love, <a href=\"http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Jenny_of_Oldstones\">Jenny of Oldstones</a>, is the subject of at least one romantic song - and in this respect the dragonfly is connected with the songs of romance that the young and innocent Sansa loves so dearly. <b>Does this mean that Sansa&rsquo;s dragonfly motif in the show is meant to refer to the story of the Prince of Dragonflies? </b>I honestly don&rsquo;t know. While Michele Clapton has read the books (<a href=\"https://latimesblogs.latimes.com/showtracker/2012/03/creative-minds-game-of-thrones-costume-designer-michele-clapton.html\">x</a>) and spoken with GRRM (<a href=\"https://www.spin.com/2013/05/game-of-thrones-costume-designer-michele-clapton-interview-hbo/\">x</a>), I haven&rsquo;t been able to find any quotes of hers about Sansa&rsquo;s dragonflies.</p><p>Since Michele Clapton hasn&rsquo;t spoken about her use of the dragonfly motif, it is important to be careful when ascribing it a specific symbolic meaning. However, in general, the dragonfly is most often associated with transformation since it is a <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/metamorphosis\">metamorphic</a> creature that undergoes a pupate stage before it emerges in its adult form with the beautiful iridescent wings. <b>The dragonfly as a symbol of transformation is incredibly apt when it comes to the narrative arc of Sansa Stark - she is constantly forced to adapt and change by external circumstances.</b> At the same time the fragile beauty of the adult dragonfly is also a very fitting image for Sansa&rsquo;s youthful beauty when she&rsquo;s a captive in the early seasons. <i>The dragonfly as a general symbol of transformation is also supported by the use of moths and butterflies as secondary symbols in her personal iconography.</i></p><p>If the dragonfly mainly symbolizes transformation in Sansa&rsquo;s personal iconography then it is no coincidence that the symbol first appear after she&rsquo;s left Winterfell - since this is really the point where her narrative journey starts to gain momentum. This is this very beginning of first transformation; from Northern girl to Southern lady - but that is just the first of her many transformations.</p><h2>The Moth and the Butterfly</h2><p>Moths and butterflies are secondary symbols in Sansa&rsquo;s personal iconography. In season 1, Sansa wears ring in what looks to be the shape of a moth, at least the ragged edges of the wings suggest a moth rather than a butterfly.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e8b0703b2fa1952bffa1e2e1c5b97cd8/tumblr_inline_plpk3zSByP1uklhai_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>In season 3, a necklace with either a butterfly or a moth motif is introduced - as are set of bodice clasps that either looks like moth wings or a type of helicopter seed pods (<a href=\"https://www.bustle.com/articles/85163-sansa-starks-fashion-evolution-through-game-of-thrones-and-how-her-wardrobe-mirrors-her-character\">x)</a>.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/670235b26228a8750094a0d9b4ee27e8/tumblr_inline_pm55vbAijg1uklhai_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>If these claps are meant to represent helicopter seed pods rather than moth/butterfly wings, then the question is this: are they meant to be decorative or symbolic? And if they are symbolic, what do they symbolize? In general terms, seed pods represent the continuation of the life cycle of they tree they come from - they fly away, fall to the ground where they lie dormant during winter until it is time put forth the first tendrils of a new plant when spring arrives. So in a sense, the seed pods of Sansa&rsquo;s claps can be said to signify growth and change just like the dragonfly.</p><p>The symbolism of both moths and butterflies varies vastly in accordance with cultural context - while there&rsquo;s some overlap between certain cultures, other cultures ascribe these creatures very different meanings (<a href=\"https://www.insects.orkin.com/ced/issue-4/lepidopteral-symbolism/list-1/\">x</a>, <a href=\"https://www.insects.orkin.com/ced/issue-4/lepidopteral-symbolism/list-2/\">x</a>) - not to mention the meanings that New Age philosophy ascribes to these creatures (<a href=\"http://mothsymbolism.com/\">x</a>). <b>There is NO universal symbolism of the butterfly and the moth!</b> Many of the meanings ascribed to them are culturally specific and it is important to be aware of this. I&rsquo;m not going to list the various symbolic meanings because there are a lot of them. Moths and butterflies belong to the same family of insects (lepidoptera). While butterflies are primarily diurnal (active during the day), moths are predominantly noctural (active at night) or crepuscular (active at twilight). Moths and butterflies sometimes have contrasting symbolic meanings and sometimes synonymous symbolic meanings, all dependent on cultural context.&nbsp;</p><h2>However, in a very general sense, both moths and butterflies are symbols of transformation as they, like the dragonfly, are metamorphic creatures.&nbsp;</h2><p>They are also delicate and fragile. However, just like in the case of the dragonfly, Clapton hasn&rsquo;t said anything about this motif - but considering that the certain parts of the symbolism of these winged creatures overlap with the dragonfly, I think it is safe to say that butterflies and moths serve the same symbolic function as the dragonfly - to signal metamorphosis and change. In this respect I agree completely with Freya Lilian Porteus:</p><blockquote><p><i>\n\nMoths, dragonflies, and butterflies are metamorphic creatures that, despite their visually flimsy allure and delicate nature, evolve and grow as they shift and change. I feel like they are a very apt metaphor for Sansa Stark, who, through her pain due to her fragile place in society as a woman, is never broken entirely.

This is the case of Sansa&rsquo;s wedding dress in season 3 since this garment is meant to be a visual manifestation of the way that the Lannisters take ownership of Sansa (and her claim to Winterfell) through her forced marriage to Tyrion Lannister. When talking about this particular costume designer Michele Clapton and embroiderer Michele Carragher both repeatedly use words like&nbsp;&ldquo;caught&rdquo;,&nbsp;&ldquo;entrapment&rdquo;,&nbsp;&ldquo;domination&rdquo; and &ldquo;ownership&rdquo;:</p><blockquote><p>\n\n<i>When Sansa is married against her will into the Lannister family, her dress shows her family&rsquo;s sigil, the dire wolf, losing out to the Lannister&rsquo;s, the lion. </i><b><i>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like she has been caught,&rdquo; explains Clapton</i>. </b>(Michele Clapton,<b>&nbsp;</b><a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fastcompany.com%2F3028226%2Fdeciphering-the-hidden-messages-in-game-of-thrones-costumes&amp;t=ODAxMWRiZGUwNDQyZGVlOGI4MmM1MDdmZmMwZTc3MzlmYmI4ZmU0OSxqazZlM3QzTQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AYD5-STb8ovo6MvPS6P_ZLA&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Ftrinuviel.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F179869368779%2Fquotes-on-sansas-s3-wedding-dress&amp;m=1\">FastCompany</a>)\n\n<br /></p><p>\n\n<i>There&rsquo;s always a movement, particularly in Sansa, where you always see which way she&rsquo;s being pulled.

There&rsquo;s a reason for this stark difference between the costumes because <b>whereas Sansa&rsquo;s purple dresses signal her removal from the influence of Cersei, the wedding dress is a statement of Lannister dominance over her person and her body.</b> The embroidery plays an especially important role in this context but I&rsquo;ll return to that subject of the embroidery later on. First I want to take closer look on the general silhouette of the dress as well as the fabric and the colour - because these elements also carry meaning.</p><p>This dress is a sort of curious combination of the voluminous skirt and a tight sleeveless bodice, which gives the whole ensemble a slightly unbalanced look. The skirt is wider and more voluminous than what is seen on other female characters at the royal court, so this isn&rsquo;t a dress that conforms to the local style. The skirt looks to be supported by some kind of armature underneath, very like the panniers at the hips that were used to create width in the skirts during the rococo style of the 18th century.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/ba3077226f29cfc38fbc485bade376a8/tumblr_inline_pm5b7n4peK1uklhai_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>The skirt also has a bit of a train and with the sleeveless bodice, the overall effect is of a dress that is a bit bottom-heavy. <b>The aesthetics of the gown is just slightly off and that is intentional.</b>&nbsp;The lack of sleeves is an especially important detail according to the embroiderer:</p><blockquote><p>\n\n<i><b>For this dress, Michelle wanted it to be a confined, restricted bodice shape with bare, vulnerable arms. </b>She wanted an embroidered band that would wrap around the bodice and tell Sansa&rsquo;s life story.</i>&nbsp;(Michele Carragher,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwinteriscoming.net%2F2014%2F04%2F06%2Fmichele-carragher-michelle-clapton-on-the-secret-narratives-in-game-of-thrones-wardrobe%2F&amp;t=OTFlODRmN2VjOGNhMmE2MTc4YjY2YTZjMDAyMzE1YjFkODAzOTM5OCxqazZlM3QzTQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AYD5-STb8ovo6MvPS6P_ZLA&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Ftrinuviel.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F179869368779%2Fquotes-on-sansas-s3-wedding-dress&amp;m=1\">Winter Is Coming</a>)\n\n<br /></p></blockquote><p>Thus, the lack of sleeves is meant to signify vulnerability, the bodice itself tight and restrictive, trapping Sansa in her dress. The skirt itself is a bit curious in that regard - <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mK0qwUAJ3xddgqxDZTxlodQ\">@caesarscat</a> <a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/181709643144/im-not-a-fashion-expert-i-love-fashion-and-keep\">suggests</a> that it is meant to create a more womanly shape for a bride that is still a child, and that is certainly a possibility. However, the volume of the skirt and the amount of fabric used (heavy brocade) must also make this dress heavy to walk in - it physically weighs her down as an external embodiment of how this whole situation weighs so heavily on her emotions.</p><p>The skirt also sports a very curious detail that contradicts the vulnerability of the bare arms. The panniers of dress is enhanced with pieces of metal (looks like bronze) with a chased pattern of plant-like arabesques.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/c7fa527720d4a64d6710c8ddfadd259e/tumblr_inline_plpk9z2mDz1uklhai_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>This is eerily similar to Cersei&rsquo;s armoured dress from season 2. Cersei literally wore armour when she felt threatened and thus these pieces of metal also evoke Sansa&rsquo;s dictum of<i> Courtesy is a lady&rsquo;s armour</i>. So while the dress primarily works as a bodily trap, restricting Sansa&rsquo;s movements and metaphorically exposing her vulnerable position, it also contains this tiny hint of Sansa&rsquo;s preferred form of passive resistance: Her use of politesse as a form of emotional armour where she keeps people at arms length, refusing to let them see how she feels - a technique she uses on Tyrion in the <a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/182045002204/winterfells-daughter-on-sansa-stark-part-15\">scene</a> right before the wedding ceremony.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve previously pointed out how Sansa&rsquo;s season 3 costumes signal a remove from the Lannister influence, particularly Cersei&rsquo;s. The wedding dress is a conspicuous re-assertion of that influence, but now in the form of dominance rather than emulation. The deep purple colours have been replaced with a shiny, gold-accented brocade very like the fabrics used for Cersei&rsquo;s and Joffrey&rsquo;s costumes.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/5017cb44691438263be4069a938297cd/tumblr_inline_plsuar1XCy1uklhai_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>The fastening of the bodice has also reverted to the side-flap that characterized her kimono dresses, which were emulating Cersei&rsquo;s season 1 look.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/aba6f39bbb4e75b25d59f727d6c96d42/tumblr_inline_plsubdYC6t1uklhai_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>At the same time, the wedding dress contains a very subtle callback to Sansa&rsquo;s Tourney dress from season one since the base colour of the gold-accented brocade is a pale lavender very similar to the season 1 dress. In a way, the use of the lavender colour is a cruel appropriation of this romantic dress (which incidentally also sports an embroidered direwolf like the wedding dress). The Tourney dress represent Sansa&rsquo;s romanticism and her love of Chivalric Romance (<a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/167245522589/winterfells-daughter-on-sansa-stark-part-5\">x</a>) - but now that romanticism has been put into a golden Lannister cage where marriage is not a union of lovers but a cynic power move against her family.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/512df38cef63fa5384b85c2c61954a44/tumblr_inline_plpk7cy2fZ1uklhai_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Another thing I noticed upon my re-watch of the wedding scene is how Sansa&rsquo;s dress visually matches Joffrey&rsquo;s opulent costume in terms of both colour and fabric. I&rsquo;ve <a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/179909400489/the-rose-of-highgarden-on-margaery-tyrell-part\">previously written</a> about how matching clothes can be used to convey political and familial unity in the case of the Tyrells. In this case, however, the visual match between Sansa&rsquo;s and Joffrey&rsquo;s costumes signals domination rather than unity.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/dd756141668ca9bfdbac5291b1c54cb8/tumblr_inline_plsucgu0AU1uklhai_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>In this context, the way that Sansa&rsquo;s and Tyrion&rsquo;s costumes don&rsquo;t match is also meaningful. While Sansa is wearing gold-and-lavender brocade, Tyrion is wearing a tunic in oxblood leather. They clash visually, standing next to each other at the altar. However, after Sansa has been garbed in the red-gold Lannister bridal cloak, the dark red accent of the cloak suddenly makes her costume match Tyrion&rsquo;s. Once again, this is not a visual statement of unity but rather of domination. With the cloaking of the bride, Tyrion (and through him House Lannister) takes possession of Sansa. She is now their property, bound to them permanently through the bonds of matrimony.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b038f639170cbf98e71cf7a112f7ce7b/tumblr_inline_plpkqcrdwL1uklhai_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Sansa&rsquo;s wedding costume also includes another element that harks back to her earlier romantic self - the lion medallion that Joffrey gave her as a love token in season 1 (he was insincere but to Sansa it was a gesture straight out of the chivalric romances she loved so much). Now this symbol of romantic love has been subverted into yet another message of domination, of ownership.</p><h2>Embroidery</h2><p>As we can see, the shape, the fabric and the colour of a costume can carry a lot of meaning. However, Clapton adds yet another narrative layer in the form of an embroidered band that wraps around the bodice and acts as a symbolic cage in the same manner that the dress itself functions as a material cage that envelops and restricts Sansa&rsquo;s body. Clapton uses embroidery extensively in her costume design as a narrative element:</p><blockquote><p>\n\n<i>&ldquo;<b>The embroidery is a subliminal way to tell someone&rsquo;s story</b>,&rdquo; says Michele Clapton</i> (<a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hollywoodreporter.com%2Fnews%2Fgame-thrones-costume-designers-reveal-705873&amp;t=ZjA0NGY0NWQ5MzQ4OGVlMjg5NWI3ZTUxOTY4ZjI3Mzc3ZmFmNTA3MyxqazZlM3QzTQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AYD5-STb8ovo6MvPS6P_ZLA&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Ftrinuviel.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F179869368779%2Fquotes-on-sansas-s3-wedding-dress&amp;m=1\">Hollywood Reporter</a>)\n\n<br /></p></blockquote><p>When it comes to the embroidery Clapton co-operates with the embroiderer Michele Carragher, who creates countless beaded embellishments for the costumes of the show. In the case of Sansa&rsquo;s wedding dress, Clapton and Carragher designed a piece of embroidery that uses the heraldry of several noble Houses to tell the story of Sansa&rsquo;s parentage and her subsequent entrapment by the Lannisters.&nbsp;Thus, the entire piece makes up a story in itself, written across the body of an unwilling child-bride.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>\n\n<i>&ldquo;<b>Obviously we imagined that the wedding dress has been commissioned by Cersei and the Lannisters for Sansa, and so the embroidery would have come from Cersei&rsquo;s mind.</b> We guessed that it wouldn&rsquo;t be romantic or lovely and girly and pretty with dainty flowers, but <b>a real strong message of dominance, saying that we own you now, Sansa.</b></i>&nbsp;(Carragher,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwinteriscoming.net%2F2014%2F04%2F06%2Fmichele-carragher-michelle-clapton-on-the-secret-narratives-in-game-of-thrones-wardrobe%2F&amp;t=OTFlODRmN2VjOGNhMmE2MTc4YjY2YTZjMDAyMzE1YjFkODAzOTM5OCxqazZlM3QzTQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AYD5-STb8ovo6MvPS6P_ZLA&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Ftrinuviel.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F179869368779%2Fquotes-on-sansas-s3-wedding-dress&amp;m=1\">Winter Is Coming</a>)\n\n<br /></p></blockquote><p>The story starts at the back of the band with a symbolic representation of Sansa&rsquo;s parentage:</p><blockquote><p>\n\n<i>&ldquo;For the wedding band, I started at the back of the waist with some <b>Stark direwolves and Tully fish entwined</b> that represent Sansa&rsquo;s parentage.&rdquo;&nbsp;\n\n</i>(Carragher, <a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwinteriscoming.net%2F2014%2F04%2F06%2Fmichele-carragher-michelle-clapton-on-the-secret-narratives-in-game-of-thrones-wardrobe%2F&amp;t=OTFlODRmN2VjOGNhMmE2MTc4YjY2YTZjMDAyMzE1YjFkODAzOTM5OCxqazZlM3QzTQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AYD5-STb8ovo6MvPS6P_ZLA&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Ftrinuviel.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F179869368779%2Fquotes-on-sansas-s3-wedding-dress&amp;m=1\">Winter Is Coming</a>) \n\n<br /></p></blockquote><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/ffdc1a2fc2579860ad7fc060a2862c20/tumblr_inline_plpki2dkLB1uklhai_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>The band cross over itself on the front of the bodice where Carragher added the Lannister lion to the unfolding narrative:</p><blockquote><p>\n\n<i>&ldquo;Then, as we move to the side, <b>the Lannister lion is tangling with the direwolf and emerging on top</b>, representing Sansa being seduced and then controlled by members of the house of Lannister.

The oldest depiction of the pomegranate in the arts date was found in the city of Uruk in ancient Sumer and dates back more than 5,000 years (<a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/archaeology/.premium.MAGAZINE-before-judaism-the-8-000-year-old-history-of-pomegranate-reverence-1.6461970\">x</a>). It was connected to the cult of<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inanna\"> Ishtar</a>/Innana, goddess of love, sex, fertility.</p><p>Throughout the Mediterranean, Near Eastern and Middle Eastern world, <b>the pomegranate</b> has been revered as <b>an ancient and potent symbol of fertility, regeneration and marriage</b>:</p><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;People use whatever is at hand to express their religious beliefs,\"says Frank A. Salamone, an authority on religious symbols and a professor at Iona College in New Rochelle, N.Y. Centuries ago, in the Fertile Crescent, where so many religions arose, the pomegranate was at hand. By its very nature, it lent itself to religious symbolism.<br /></i></p><p><i>\"The pomegranate is red, and so is blood,&rdquo; Salamone says. &ldquo;It has a lot of seeds and is an obvious symbol of fertility.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s beautiful, strong and delicate, and its juice has healing properties, he says. &ldquo;It says a lot of different things all at once. People bring meaning to it.&rdquo;</i> (<a href=\"https://www.beliefnet.com/news/2005/11/a-pomegranate-for-all-religions.aspx\">Prof. Frank A. Salamone</a>)<br /></p></blockquote><p>The pomegranate tree is considered to have <a href=\"https://itsallgreeklondon.wordpress.com/2014/10/29/the-significance-of-the-pomegranate-in-ancient-greece/\">originated</a> in the in Persia (Iran) and its connection with notions of fertility is intimately connected with the advent and spread of agriculture. It&rsquo;s status as a symbol of fertility was most likely transmitted through a kind of cross-cultural pollination along with the tree as it was exported East to China and West to Egypt, Turkey, North Africa, Greece and Rome.</p><p>While it is a fertility symbol in many cultures, the fruit also became associated with Death and Resurrection in Greek and Roman mythology. Most famously in the <a href=\"http://itsallgreeklondon.wordpress.com/2014/10/29/the-significance-of-the-pomegranate-in-ancient-greece/\">myth of Persephone</a>, daughter of the fertility goddess Demeter. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persephone\">Persephone</a> was a vegetation goddess like Demeter but according to myth she was abducted by Hades, the God of the Underworld. Demeter went into mourning and all plant life died so Zeus commanded Hades to release her daughter. However, Hades had tricked Persephone into eating six pomegranate seeds and so she was forced to spend six months of the year as Queen of the Underworld and the remaining six months above ground as a goddess of spring. The myth of Persephone is essentially an allegorical retelling of the changing of the seasons - and thus <b>the pomegranate is not just connected to fertility</b> (spring) <b>but also</b> <b>to death</b> (winter) <b>and resurrection</b> (the re-emergence of spring).</p><p>However, the pomegranate as a symbol of death and resurrection is also connected to another mythical figure: Adonis, the lover of Venus, the Roman goddess of love and sex. In the <i>Metamorphoses</i>, the Roman poet Ovid recounts the tale of Adonis who is slain on a hunt and the grief-stricken Venus creates the anemone flower, red like a pomegranate in memory of him:</p><blockquote><p><i>When from the heights she saw the lifeless body lying in its own blood, she leapt down, tearing her clothes, and tearing at her hair as well, and beat at her breasts with fierce hands, complaining to the fates. &ldquo;And yet not everything is in your power&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Adonis, there shall be an everlasting token of my grief, and every year an imitation of your death will complete a re-enactment of my mourning. <b>But your blood will be changed into a flower</b>&hellip;&rdquo; So saying, she sprinkled the blood with odorous nectar: and, at the touch, it swelled up, as bubbles emerge in yellow mud. <b>In less than an hour, a flower, of the colour of blood, was created such as pomegranates carry, that hide their seeds under a tough rind.</b> But enjoyment of it is brief: for, lightly clinging, and too easily fallen, the winds deflower it, which are likewise responsible for its name, windflower: anemone</i>&rsquo; (<a href=\"http://ovidsmetamorphoses.blogspot.com/2012/08/an-anemone-for-adonis.html\">Source</a>)</p></blockquote><p>According to myth, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adonis\">Adonis</a> was raised by Persephone in the Underworld - but the figure has much older roots in the Sumerian story of Innana and Dumuzid. Adonis is thus very likely connected to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dying-and-rising_deity\">Dying-and-Rising archetype</a>, which characterizes a number of male fertility gods in the Middle Eastern and Mediterranean region of during Antiquity.</p><p>Christianity also appropriated the symbolism of Fertility and Resurrection associated with the pomegranate into its iconography:</p><blockquote><p><i><b>\n\nIn Christian art the pomegranate</b>, often split\nand showing the seeds, <b>was interpreted as a\nsymbol of fertility, hope of immortality, and\nthe Resurrection</b>. The infant Jesus is frequently seen in paintings and sculpture presenting\nthe pomegranate to his mother. In the last of\nthe famous Unicorn tapestries at The Cloisters the symbolic meaning of marriage and fertility is illustrated by showing the Unicorn\nchained to the pomegranate tree, with the red\nseeds of a bursting fruit spilling on him.</i> (<a href=\"https://www.metmuseum.org/pubs/bulletins/1/pdf/3257268.pdf.bannered.pdf\">Hildegard Schneider</a>)<br /></p></blockquote><p>So the pomegranates on Sansa&rsquo;s wedding dress has a very old and rich symbolic history - and <b>the connection between the pomegranate and fertility is very apt in this context since the Lannisters intend for Sansa to bear fruit in her marriage in the form of a Lannister-Stark child</b> through which they can claim the North.</p><p>Even more interesting is the fact that Sansa has her very own pomegranate symbolism in GRRM&rsquo;s text. After Petyr Baelish spirits Sansa away to the Fingers, he offers her pomegranates and other fruits during a private conversation where he&rsquo;s imparting his particular brand of wisdom:</p><blockquote><p><i>\n\nGrisel reappeared before he could say more, balancing a large platter. She set it down between them. There were apples and pears and pomegranates, some sad-looking grapes, a huge blood orange. The old woman had brought a round of bread as well, and a crock of butter. <b>Petyr cut a pomegranate in two with his dagger, offering half to Sansa.</b> &ldquo;You should try and eat, my lady.&rdquo; &ldquo;Thank you, my lord.&rdquo; <b>Pomegranate seeds were so messy; Sansa chose a pear instead</b>, and took a small delicate bite. It was very ripe. The juice ran down her chin.</i></p><p><i>&hellip;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;In King&rsquo;s Landing, there are two sorts of people. The players and the pieces.&rdquo;\n\n<br /></i></p><p><i>\n\n&ldquo;And I was a piece?&rdquo; She dreaded the answer.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Yes, but don&rsquo;t let that trouble you. You&rsquo;re still half a child. Every man&rsquo;s a piece to start with, and every maid as well. Even some who think they are players.&rdquo; He ate another seed. &ldquo;Cersei, for one. She thinks herself sly, but in truth she is utterly predictable. Her strength rests on her beauty, birth, and riches. Only the first of those is truly her own, and it will soon desert her. I pity her then. She wants power, but has no notion what to do with it when she gets it. <b>Everyone wants something, Alayne. And when you know what a man wants you know who he is, and how to move him</b>.\"&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>&hellip;</i></p><p><i><b>\n\nLord Petyr</b> dismissed him with a wave, and <b>returned to the pomegranate again</b> as Oswell shuffled down the steps. &rdquo;<b>Tell me, Alayne&mdash;which is more dangerous, the dagger brandished by an enemy, or the hidden one</b> pressed to your back by someone you never even see?&ldquo;</i></p><p><i>\"The hidden dagger.&rdquo;</i>&nbsp;(ASoS, Sansa VI)&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>Baelish then starts to eat a blood orange as he continues to talk, steadily guiding Sansa through his machinations until she realizes that it was Olenna Tyrell who poisoned Joffrey:</p><blockquote><p><i>\n\nHe tilted his chin back and squeezed the blood orange, so the juice ran down into his mouth. &ldquo;I love the juice but I loathe the sticky fingers,&rdquo; he complained, wiping his hands. &ldquo;<b>Clean</b> <b>hands, Sansa. Whatever you do, make certain your hands are clean.</b>&rdquo;</i> (ASoS, Sansa VI)<br /></p></blockquote><p>The conversation goes on as Baelish relates exactly how he manipulated the Tyrells into doing what he wanted.</p><p>This is not just a conversation over fruit where Baelish instructs his new pupil in the subtleties of the game of thrones. <b>It is a temptation scenario where he offers Sansa a fruit associated with temptation as he intends to mold her into his own image. </b>Like Hades, Baelish<b>&nbsp;</b>tempts Sansa with the pomegranate but unlike Persephone, Sansa refuses the fruit.&nbsp;</p><h2>Sansa REFUSES the pomegranate! This is very important because it foreshadows her eventually rejecting Baelish and his nefarious ambitions.</h2><p>This temptation scenario is lent even more symbolic weight if we consider the hypothesis that the Forbidden Fruit in the Garden of Eden might not have been an apple but a pomegranate! (<a href=\"https://iranian.com/2009/05/04/it-was-a-pomegranate-not-an-apple-depicted-in-the-biblical-garden-of-eden-part-i/\">x</a>) This interpretation is still somewhat controversial but if the Forbidden Fruit was indeed a pomegranate then the Temptation of Eve does have an interesting parallel with the Temptation of Persephone.</p><p>I have been unable to find any confirmation that the pomegranates on Sansa&rsquo;s wedding dress are meant to have a deeper meaning than an association to the Lannister red. However, Carragher develops her creations in collaboration with Clapton and she does quite a bit of historical research:</p><blockquote><p><i>\n\nFor &ldquo;Game of Thrones,&rdquo; Carragher often spends as long thinking about a piece as she does making it. <b>First, she confers with Clapton about each character&rsquo;s narrative arc </b>and the costumes Clapton has designed for them. <b>Then Carragher does historical research</b> in museums near her home, in East London. After a month of planning, she ships her materials to the show&rsquo;s Belfast production studios, where she works six days a week, twelve hours a day, embellishing a season&rsquo;s worth of costumes.</i> (<a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/embroidering-game-of-thrones\">The NewYorker</a>)<br /></p></blockquote><h2>Thus, it is not implausible that adorning a wedding dress with&nbsp;an age old symbol of fertility and marriage is not entirely coincidental on the part of the designers!</h2></p>",

This post is the 17th installment in this series and the last one that deals with Sansa&rsquo;s season 3 arc.&nbsp;<br /></p>\n<p>In this post, I&rsquo;m going to take a closer look at Sansa&rsquo;s costumes during the season with a special emphasis on her spectacular golden wedding gown since her season 3 arc revolves around her political value as Robb&rsquo;s heir apparent and there are several plots aimed at securing the Key to the North through marriage. It is also a costume that is inscribed with a lot of narrative and symbolic meaning that subtly enriches her story and her characterization.</p>\n<p>Costume design is an integral aspect of the visual language of cinema and television - and especially on <i>Game of Thrones </i>since costume designer Michele Clapton approaches the costumes in terms of story-telling.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><i>I always try to <b>make the clothes visually tell something</b>.</i> (<a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.fidmmuseum.org%2Fmuseum%2F2018%2F09%2Finterview-with-game-of-thrones-costume-designer-michele-clapton.html&amp;t=NGI5YzYxY2NlMjQ3ZTFhMGJiMTRiZDY4NjkwNjBjMjdiNjZlYTQwOCx4eUJnV1ZaYg%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AYD5-STb8ovo6MvPS6P_ZLA&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Ftrinuviel.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F179909400489%2Fthe-rose-of-highgarden-on-margaery-tyrell-part&amp;m=1\">FIDM Museum Blog</a>) <br /></p>\n<p><i>I always try to tell that story &mdash; <b>the costumes for me are narrative</b> and you should be able to look at them [the characters] and understand where they are mentally in their journey.</i> (<a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thisisinsider.com%2Fgame-of-thrones-costume-designer-michele-clapton-interview-2017-6&amp;t=NTIxNTlmMTQ5MDZmYmVlNjdjZWJhM2M0Y2VkMmQ5ZmI3NGI1NTZjMCx4eUJnV1ZaYg%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AYD5-STb8ovo6MvPS6P_ZLA&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Ftrinuviel.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F179909400489%2Fthe-rose-of-highgarden-on-margaery-tyrell-part&amp;m=1\">Insider</a>)</p>\n<p>\n\n<i><b>I love to try and indicate the emotional state of characters through their costumes, and also to indicate their influence over other characters and courts. </b>Sometimes this says so much more than words.</i> (<a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.spin.com%2F2013%2F05%2Fgame-of-thrones-costume-designer-michele-clapton-interview-hbo%2F&amp;t=NWMzN2ExM2MzZGU4YjY5NjIzYmExOWY4MzY4NGE2ZDU3YTgxM2NiZCxqazZlM3QzTQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AYD5-STb8ovo6MvPS6P_ZLA&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Ftrinuviel.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F179869368779%2Fquotes-on-sansas-s3-wedding-dress&amp;m=1\">SPIN</a>)\n\n<br /></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Thus, the costumes are incredibly important in this show and it is worth paying attention to them because every single detail is meaningful:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n\n<i><b>Everything &ndash; even a fashion choice &ndash; has meaning on &ldquo;Game of Thrones.&rdquo; </b>In this cutthroat world where men fight for the Iron Throne and the women yield a different kind of power, <b>a choice of fabric or a different cut of cloth can be a political statement, costume designer Michele Clapton told TODAY.com</b></i><b>.</b>(<a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.today.com%2Fstyle%2Fwhat-expect-costumes-season-3-game-thrones-1C9143460&amp;t=YTMwZTU5MjllNmQ3NTU4MjAzYzI2Y2I1NjBkZjMxYWY3YTUxNDEwOSxqazZlM3QzTQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AYD5-STb8ovo6MvPS6P_ZLA&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Ftrinuviel.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F179869368779%2Fquotes-on-sansas-s3-wedding-dress&amp;m=1\">Today</a>)\n\n<br /></p></blockquote>\n<p>Even in real life, clothing has always had symbolic and communicative value through which people signal social and cultural positions. In short, fashion and dress codes place people within a given culture. <i>Garments function as non-verbal signs that&nbsp;that can be interpreted differently depending on the context, situation or culture </i>(<a href=\"http://theministeroffashion.com/semiotics-of-fashion/\">x</a>). That is doubly so for costume design since it its entire raison d&rsquo;etre is to support and enrich the story that is told.</p>\n</p>",

Their romance has been foreshadow pretty much since book 1 and season 1 and their marriage will bring peace and prosperity to Westeros. The wars of Ice and Fire will destroy the kingdom and they will be the ones rebuilding the realm to its former glory; Jon and Sansa storyline are in a perfect parallel and they have been groomed to be king and queen of Westeros for the whole storyline in the books.</p><h2>JON SNOW HAS ALWAYS LOVED SANSA STARK;</h2><p><br/></p><p>Jon Snow has always been in love with his cousin Sansa Stark, which is why he decided to go to the wall after Ned Stark accepted Sansa\u2019s engagement to Joffrey Baratheon. Jon was written as a mirror to Jaime Lannister and one of the reasons Jaime decided to join the kingsguard was because he could never marry his sister and lover Cersei. Once the secret of Lyanna and Rheagar is finally out, Jon and Sansa will be free to be together. Their love story is the main romance of the books.</p><p>BTW, don\u2019t be surprised if they reveal the romance between Jon and Sansa in the end of the first episode of season 8. The episode will start mirroring the pilot episode, when King Robert arrived at Winterfell with his Lannister family and we all know the episode ended with the reveal of Cersei and Jaime incestual romance.</p><p><br/></p><h2>JON SNOW IS GOING TO BE A STARK;</h2><p>Jon Snow is going to take Sansa Stark name and pass the Stark name to all his children. He will be finally be a Stark and die as a true son by law of Eddard Stark, just like he always dreamed of in the books. This was foreshadowed in season 6 episode 5, when Sansa cloaked Jon Snow with a Stark Cloak.</p><p><br/></p><h2>JON WILL FATHER A BASTARD</h2><p>Jon Snow will father a bastard. He will have trueborn sons with his wife Sansa Stark, but he will have a bastard girl with Daenerys. The books have foreshadowed this event to death. Jon and Sansa will pass this bastard girl as their own trueborn child and give her their Stark name. Sansa will raise this child as her own daughter and make her a Stark. That\u2019s why the show wrote that scene with Catelyn Stark and Talissa on season 3 where Catelyn says that she failed to love and care for her husband bastard child, Sansa will do the opposite and love and care for Jon\u2019s bastard daughter.</p><p>Jon will do the inverse of his uncle Ned, who lied and raised his trueborn nephew as a bastard. The story of Game of Thrones started with Ned Stark starting a war to prevent a bastard son of Cersei Lannister to sit in the Throne and it will end with a bastard daughter of Jon Snow as the heir of the Throne. History repeat itself and in the end, there wont be much difference between Starks and Lannister, they all lie to protect the ones they love.</p><p>\u201cThe things we do for love\u201d will still be the theme of the story in the end\u2026.</p><p><br/></p><h2>THIS IS A STORY OF FATHER\u2019S DAUGHTERS\u2026.</h2><p><br/></p><p>A SONG OF ICE AND FIRE its many tales in one; this is a tale of a Dragon prince madly in love with a Wolf girl; this is also a tale about home and families; about the things we do for love; it\u2019s a story about tyranny and fear; its also a story about slow learners, who make several mistakes, but that eventually do learn, but ALSO, A SONG OF ICE AND FIRE, is a story about father\u2019s daughters.</p><p>And that\u2019s exactly what Arya, Sansa, Cersei, Daenerys, Brienne all are. These women are their father\u2019s daughters. That\u2019s why the show gave so much importance on those character\u2019s fathers and hardly touched the mothers relevance.</p><p>No one thought Sansa and Daenerys had much of their fathers in themselves, those two characters were always associated with their mothers, yet they will prove to all of us that they carry much of Eddar and Aerys inside of them, in the last part of this story.</p><p><br/></p><h2>THE STARK SISTERS WILL GET EVERYTHING THEY EVER WANTED\u2026</h2><blockquote><br/></blockquote><p><br/></p><figure data-orig-width=\"640\" data-orig-height=\"360\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/2f7beda43cf2d3363b1942b24764016c/tumblr_inline_pm5u2jBCaP1sgp768_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"640\" data-orig-height=\"360\"/></figure><blockquote><p>Arya: \u201cWe both wanted to be the other people when we were younger. You wanted to be a queen and sit next to a handsome, young king on the Iron Throne. I wanted to be a knight, to pick up a sword like father and go off to battle. Neither of us got to be that other person, did we? The world doesnt just let girls decide what they are going to be.\u201d\u2019</p><p>(SEASON 7 EPISODE 6)</p><p><br/></p></blockquote><h2>AND THEY ARE GOING TO BE QUEENS\u2026.</h2><p>Yes, we will have two queens. Game of Thrones started with two queens. Daenerys and Cersei; one a conqueror, the second a consort queen. Two women, whose obsession for the Iron Throne, left a trail of death and destruction on Essos and Westeros. So, we will finish this story with two queens, who will restore the Kingdom and improve the lives of their people. Sansa will be the consort queen of Jon Snow and Arya will be the warrior, the conquering queen that will lead the armies of North, Vale and Riverlands into war in season 8.</p><p><br/></p><h2>SANSA STARK WILL BE \u201cTHE QUEEN\u201d;</h2><p><br/></p><p>Queen Sansa Stark will change the Law of Succession allowing girls to be heirs in front of their younger brothers. Sansa it\u2019s the YMBQ of the prophecy and she will be the one casting Cersei Lannister down; Sansa will be very political active queen, changing laws and improving the lives of the people of Westeros and making important changes in the realm; She will be loved by her people and called THE QUEEN.</p><p>Sansa was always meant to be the final queen and the one who will rebuild the kingdom after the wars. Sansa entire storyline in the books was about observing the major players of the game make their moves and see the ramifications of those decisions. In Kings Landing, Sansa saw it first hand how ruling can affect the lives of the people in Westeros. She was able to see what to do, when in power, but also, what NOT to do as a king or queen. She learned a lot from Cersei, Margaery, Ollena, the Tyrells, The Lannisters, Littlefinger and will use this education for good use as a queen.</p><p>All Sansa\u2019s dreams will come true and she will be a living proof that \u201clife is a song\u201d. She will marry her brave and gentle hero; she will have children and rebuild her family and she will be a very beloved queen, admired for her beauty and kindness.</p><p><br/></p><h2>ARYA WILL BE THE QUEEN IN THE NORTH;</h2><p><br/></p><p>Arys Stark will rule the North as a Regent Queen. Arya storyline in season 8 will be a copy of Papa Ned in the first Rebellion against the Mad King. She will call the banners and lead the North armies into battle in the final war of this story. George RRMartin himself said that she would conquer the world in the final part of this tale.</p><p><br/></p><h2>ARYA WILL BE VERY IMPORTANT IN THE FINAL SEASON !!!!!</h2><p><br/></p><p>Arya is season 8 will be a huge warrior, with the help of Nymeria and their pack of wolves, she is going to lead their armies into battle, defeating Daenerys armies in combat (yes, the Dothraki bitches!!!!!!) They will probably meet in the Riverlands, where Rheagar and Robert had their first and final confrontation. She will be the one who will kill the mountain, avenging the people that he cruelly killed in the Riverlands and the Hound. Just like papa Ned became famous for killing Ser Arthur Dane, Arya will be legendary for killing the Mountain. They will write songs about her for years and years to come\u2026\u2026</p><p><br/></p><h2>BRAN STARK WILL BE THE MAGICAL FORCE TO STOP THE ARMY OF THE DEAD\u2026</h2><h2><br/></h2><figure data-orig-width=\"628\" data-orig-height=\"646\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/cb5a9eeba9a21e09fa027a4d5e29bee9/tumblr_inline_pm5u5aiMqM1sgp768_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"628\" data-orig-height=\"646\"/></figure><h2><br/></h2><p>I know the audience expects Daenerys and her dragons to be the magical force used to stop the Army of the Dead, but, don\u2019t be shocked if she decides to abandon the cause in the middle of the fight and leave the North before the big battle against the Night King. There is a lot of Stannis in Daenerys character arc on season 7 and in the end, Stannis left Jon and the Nights Watch on their own to fight the Night King on Hardhome, and went to march to Winterfell to fight the Boltons. Stannis could never let it go completely of the Iron Throne and I expect Dany to do the same.</p><p>Its Bran Stark, who has been preparing himself to face this threat since the beginning of this story. Its Bran Stark who has been foreshadowed by the books and tv show to be the one who will matter the most in the end. Not the dragons. I suspect we will see the ghosts of the Kings of Winter, coming out from the crypts of Winterfell, to fight the final battle against the Army of the Dead.</p><p>Bran: What else have you seen it? Jojen: The ONLY think that matters. YOU.</p><p>(Season 3 Episode 2)</p><p>Also, in the first Long Night, there was no Targaryens; The North was left to fight on its own with the help of the Children of the Forest and George likes to repeat his stories very closely to the original. Defeating the Army of the Dead wont be Bran only job in season 8, he has also been written as a foil to Daenerys, so I believe he will be involved on her final defeat.</p><p><br/></p><h2>DAENERYS WILL BE THE FINAL ANTAGONIST IN SEASON 8 AND WE WILL HAVE A SECOND DANCE OF DRAGONS BETWEEN JON AND DANY\u2026\u2026</h2><p><br/></p><figure data-orig-width=\"750\" data-orig-height=\"563\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/21fdccfff8b756b781f5c03f45e95a7e/tumblr_inline_pm5u5w9MAV1sgp768_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"750\" data-orig-height=\"563\"/></figure><h2><br/></h2><blockquote><p>Jon Snow: <b>\u201cThey will see it you for \u201cwhat you are\u201d.</b></p><p><b>(</b>SEASON 7 EPISODE 6)</p><p><br/></p></blockquote><p>In the beginning of this story we saw Sansa Stark falling madly in love with a beautiful prince, only to have her heart broken in a million of pieces in the end of season 1, when Joffrey shocked her by cutting her father\u2019s head, finally showing how cruel and monstrous he really was. In the beginning of the series, we also had the audience falling madly in love with the beautiful Daenerys Targaryen, believing she was the hero of this story and just like Sansa, the audience will be shocked by Daenerys actions in season 8 and they will have their hearts completely broken in a million of pieces. Daenerys will finally show to the audience the monster that she really is. I expect to see a lot of shades of Joffrey on Daenerys in season 8. Remember, Joffrey believed his whole life he was the true heir of the Iron Throne, until a Stark man showed up in his life, telling him that this was a lie. This is exactely what is going to happen to Daenerys in season 8.</p><p>Remember when Sansa Stark fell madly in love with a monster and trusted a beautiful queen blindly when she was warned against it? You are all Sansas, you just don\u2019t know yet.</p><p>Daenerys could never be the villain of her own story. That\u2019s why it was always necessary for her to create a lie that painted her as the hero. She invaded Astapor to save the Unsulied from the evil wise masters; she conquered Meereen to pay back the slavers for crucifying the children slaves; she destroyed the sacred temple of Vaes Dothrak and killed all the Khalls, but she did for the Dothraki widows who didnt wish to stay in the Dosh khaleen. Now in Westeros she had no more excuses, there is no slavery or evil masters torturing young boys in the 7 Kingdoms, so she was forced to create a new excuse to defend her invasion of Westeros.</p><p>So, she told the audience that she wants to break the wheel of power that crushes the poor and the weak on Westeros. It makes no sense of course. She wants to break the wheel, by building a new wheel, this time, with only her family on top, crushing those under her. This is a phony ridiculous excuse and its supposed to be ridiculous. It\u2019s a silly lie, all Daenerys wants in the Iron Throne, but she cant admit it afraid it will make her look bad, so she created this silly little lie and the audience (just like Sansa fell into Cersei silly lies in season 1) fell right into. What Dany really wants is install an absolute monarchy, with only HER in power.</p><p>Daenerys is a false prophet, who invented a sacred mission to convince her people and those who follow her of her good intentions, yet all her actions are motivated from the desire to take The Iron Throne, that\u2019s the one thing who truly matters for Daenerys and now in season 8, when her claim to the Throne will be contested by the bombastic news of Jon Snow stronger claim to the Throne. That\u2019s whe she will finally show to the audience who she really is.</p><p><br/></p><h2>WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE BLINDLY FOLLOW, GOD AND HEROS;</h2><p><br/></p><p>By writing Daenerys Targaryen, George RRMartin wanted to show us how dictators and cult leaders are created. They started magical and inspiring, making beautiful speeches and promising great things, but in end, most of them are motivated by selfish desires and allow power to corrupt them. Daenerys story is also a warning about following leaders without questioning their motivations or decisions. Daenerys is adored as a goddess by her followers and never has her decision questioned by them. Unlike Jon Snow who is always questioned by Sansa, The North Lords and the Wildlings about his decisions. The Dothraki and the Unsullied just blindly follow Daenerys around, like children following their mothers, never questioning her real motives, or even contemplating if the move to Westeros has actually any benefits for them. And as we are about to see in season 8, following leaders blindly can be a very dangerous thing because it can lead us to our graves. The audience, the Dothraki and the Unsullied never thought that their hero could just simply be lying to them\u2026\u2026No matter how much destruction and death she causes, her followers and advisers keep believing in her, defending her decisions, turning a blind eye to her questionable actions, finding excuses to her terrible acts. They know that she can be impulsive and dangerous but believe that in the end she is motivated by great ideals and will always listen to her advisers\u2026\u2026..</p><p>Daenerys first instinct is always destruction and violence, but most of the time, she is restrained by her advisers\u2026\u2026\u2026. But the rope that holds her together is about to be ripped apart in season 8.</p><p><br/></p><blockquote><p>Daario Naharis: <b>\u201cI pity the Lords of Westeros, they have no idea what is coming for them\u201d</b></p><p>(SEASON 6 EPISODE 10)</p><p><br/></p></blockquote><p>Daenerys was always meant to be the final antagonist of the story, her time in Essos was not about learning to be a good queen, she was learning to be a ruthless conqueror, which she learned very well. Don\u2019t be surprised if she marries Euron Greyjoy, they marriage has been foreshadowed on books and tv show. Daenerys its gonna shock the audience, she is going to behave in a way that will surprise a lot of people.<br/></p><p>Jon and Daenerys relationship will mirror Rhaenyra and Aegon tragic battle for the Throne; This will be the final battle on episode 5, the fight for the Throne has always been the main focus of the story and this battle its what is going to put an end to this tale. Westeros will finally be united against the common enemy, which is Daenerys and her dragons.</p><p>The Army of the Dead and the Night King were always a red herring, its was always Daenerys and her dragons the major threat for Westeros. I believe that more than half of the population of Westeros will perish during the final wars; many who survive the war will latter die during the winter without the food that was destroyed by Daenerys dragons in the Field of Fire 2.0; in her short period in Westeros, Daenerys will cause a lot of deaths and destruction and she will be remembered as the Queen of Ashes.</p><p>The stallion that mounts the world was never Rhaego. It was always going to be Daenerys. Essos will also be throw into chaos, without Daenerys dragons to impose order, the masters of Astapor, Meereen and the local cities will raise again and the region will probably be engulfed into a civil war. It will probably take centuries for the world to recover from Daenerys reign of terror.</p><p><br/></p><h2>WINTER WILL COME TO HOUSE TARGARYEN;</h2><p><b><br/></b></p><p>Daenerys final battle on episode 5, will turn Kings Landing into ashes, but she wont be destroying just the capital of the realm, she will also put an end to House Targaryen. Their dynasty started with the destruction of Harrenhall and will end with the destruction of the capital that The Targaryens themselves build, closing a cycle of tyranny, fear and terror. Daenerys will be the last dragon.</p><h2>DRAGONSTONE WILL FAIL;</h2><p><br/></p><figure data-orig-width=\"2000\" data-orig-height=\"1120\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/31e728bb18f6e03ee2f8869ca038918f/tumblr_inline_pm5u98wcWp1sgp768_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"2000\" data-orig-height=\"1120\"/></figure><h2><br/></h2><p>I believe that Dragonstone will be destroyed in the end. The Castle in the remote island serves no purpose for Westeros. It can not be used for grains production or animal livestock, the only use for Dragonstone in the past centuries was to be used as base for a foreign invasion, the castle will probably be destroyed in the end. Also important, Daenerys spent this entire story threatening to destroy other\u2019s peoples houses and cities. To have her own ancestral House destroyed in the end would be very fitting to the story.<br/></p><p><br/></p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cso comes snow, after fire and even dragons have their ending\u201d\u00a0</i></p><p>J.

Robert\u2019s Rebelion will happen again. Sansa will be kidnapped at some point, just like aunt Lyanna Stark; Arya will lead the North armies south to save her sister (just like Ned Stark did in Robert\u2019s Rebellion). The Riverlands, the North and the Vale will once again gather forces and go to war.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><blockquote><p>Stannis: \u201cWhat are you reading?\u201d</p><p>Shireen: <b>&ldquo;The Dance of Dragons.&rdquo;</b></p><p>Stannis: \u201cWhat&rsquo;s it about? It&rsquo;s the story of the fight between Rhaenyra Targaryen and her half-brother Aegon for control over the Seven Kingdoms. Both of them thought they belonged on the Iron Throne. When people started declaring for one of them or the other, their fight divided the kingdoms in two. <b>Brothers fought brothers, dragons fought dragons. By the time it was over, thousands were dead. And it was a disaster for the Targaryens as well. They never truly recovered.</b></p><p>(GAME OF THRONES SEASON 5 EPISODE 9)</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p></blockquote><p>We will have a second Dance of Dragons, with the kingdom divided between Jon Snow and Daenerys Targaryen. The Lannisters will be divided too by this war. Tyrion (the flop) will choose Daenerys side and Jaime will choose Jon Snow and the Starks. This will be the decision that will change Jaime Lannister legacy forever.</p><p>Millions will die, but in the end Jon Snow and his armies will defeat Daenerys and her dragons. This war will not only destroy the realm but finally bring an end to the Targaryen dynasty. This battle will probably happens on episode 5.</p><p><br/></p><h2>SANSA\u2019S PLANS TO CAST DOWN CERSEI\u2026</h2><p><br/></p><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"287\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/606011674977c01975eb40f294e3fd29/tumblr_inline_pm5uanuNnL1sgp768_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"287\"/></figure><h2><br/></h2><h2><br/></h2><p>Sansa will be kidnapped in season 8, probably by Cersei, but don\u2019t be surprised if this kidnapping has a twist. In season 1, in the scene where Cersei and the small council is forcing Sansa to write down a letter to Rob Stark demanding him to bend the knee to King Joffrey., we have Maester Pycelle warning Cersei that Sansa may be so sweet and innocent now, but once she is older, she may hatch some treasons!!!!</p><blockquote><p>\u201cshe (Sansa) may be a sweet thing now Your Grace, but in 10 YEARS, who knows what treasons she may hatch!!!!\u201d</p><p>(SEASON 1 EPISODE 8)</p><p><br/></p></blockquote><p>Now, we know that Sansa did learn a lot from Cersei and maybe now she is finally ready to outsmart her former teacher\u2026 This was the first foreshadowing of Sansa\u2019s plans to cast down Cersei.</p><p>And in season 6, we have another foreshadowing of how Sansa will plot against Cersei in the end, When Arya is in Braavos, she watches a Bravossi Theather play telling the events that happened in Westeros. In that storyline, the actress that plays Sansa hires a faceless man to kill the actress who plays Cersei, Lady Crane. I believe this was another foreshadowing of the events that will happen in season 8. Its Sansa who is taking Cersei down. The little dove will prove to the queen that she learned all her lessons. But I believe Jon Snow will be the one killing Cersei.</p><p><br/></p><h2>EPISODE 5 WILL BE THE DANCE OF DRAGONS;</h2><p><br/></p><blockquote><p>He was no dragon, Dany thought, curiously calm. Fire cannot kill a dragon.</p><p>(A Game of Thrones - Daenerys V)</p><p><br/></p></blockquote><p><br/></p><p>Well I believe thats exactly whats its gonna happen. In order to defeat Daenerys you have to kill her last dragon, Drogon, which we know will be flying over Kings Landing in the end of this story. Thats how the wildfire comes in. I actually think Jon and the Lannisters may set a trap for Dany and use the wildfire to kill the dragon and Daenery\u2019s remain armies. Maybe Bran was behind King Aerys decision to cover KL with wildfire, already preparing to use against Daenerys in the finall battle for the Throne. if we rewatch season 5 episode 7 we had a little hint about this idea.</p><p><br/></p><blockquote><p>DAARIO: On the day of the Great Games, gather all the great masters, and wise masters, and worthy masters you can find, and slaughter them all.</p><p>DAENERYS: I am a queen. Not a butcher.</p><p>DAARIO: All rulers are either butchers or meat.</p><p><br/></p></blockquote><p><br/></p><p>Remember that Bran\u2019s first chapter he is forced to watch his father doing the Kings\u2019s justice and Ned explains to him that \u201cthe man who passes the sentence, must swing the sword\u201d. This is one of the most important themes in the story.</p><p>Also, in season 4 episode 2, we have Bran having a vision of the events that will happen for the first time. This is THE vision where he sees the dragon flying over KL. After the vision he tells Jojen and Meera: \u201cI know where we have to go\u201d. The show then cuts to a scene in Kings Landing.</p><p>So, I do believe Bran will be involved with the explosion of Kings Landing and using the wildfire as a last weapon to defeat Daenerys and her last dragon. Thats the only way Westeros will ever be free of the Targaryens.</p><p>BTW, gathering all your enemies in a closed space and destroying them with fire has been used by both mad queens, Cersei and Daenerys, so maybe now we will see the Starks using this idea to finally get rid of Daenerys, her armies and her dragon.</p><p><br/></p><h2>THE FUTURE OF HOUSE LANNISTER</h2><p>No, House Lannister will not fall into nothing like the Targaryens. The House will be saved by Jaime Lannister, who will marry Brienne of Tarth and restore his family and legacy.</p><p><br/></p><h2>JAIME LANNISTER ITS GOING TO BE THE FINAL HAND AND ITS GOING TO END THIS STORY AS A GREAT HERO;</h2><p><br/></p><figure data-orig-width=\"980\" data-orig-height=\"490\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/73b5389c30d8ef91064c03b6c0a5f945/tumblr_inline_pm5ueyWqgV1sgp768_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"980\" data-orig-height=\"490\"/></figure><p>Jaime Lannister will choose Jon Snow, this will be the turning point for Jaime and the choice that will change his legacy. There is some very good foreshadowing in the books that hint to us that Jaime will side with Jon Snow in the final battle and help him to defeat Daenerys and her dragons.<br/></p><p>I believe it will be Jaime who will kill Daenerys last dragon, Drogon, and becoming famous as a DRAGONSLAYER; Jaime Lannister will have a big role in the final part of this story, not only helping defeat the ARMY OF THE DEAD, but also defeating Daenerys Targaryen and saving the Kingdom once again from a tyrannical Targaryen; only this time he will finally receive the thank you, from the people of Westeros;</p><p>Jaime will be greeted as a hero and will end this story beloved and admired by the people. I believe at some point in season 8 Jaime will die and will be brought back to life, his character was written as a mirror to Jon Snow and Jon died on season 5, so this storyline may be possible.</p><p>Jaime will be the Hand of the King for Jon Snow (there is a lot of foreshadowing for this, in both books and tv show) and he will be able to finish his history in the white book as a hero. He will go down in history as one of the greatest Hands in the history of the 7 kingdoms. Jaime will be the last Lannister left on Westeros.</p><p><br/></p><h2>TYRION WILL BE SENT INTO EXILE;</h2><p><br/></p><p>Tyrion will have to face a trial for a third time and this time he will be guilty of his crimes. Yeah, that is not a prediction, it\u2019s a spoiler, but I already expected that. George loves his 3. Tyrion its one of the characters that will have a very tragic ending. He was the fool who brought Daenerys to Westeros believing he could control her, the same mistake his sister Cersei tried to do with Joffrey. He invited Jon Snow under false premises to Dragonstone without mentioning to Jon about Daenerys demands to bend the knee.</p><p>He made a deal with Cersei that was never disclosed to the audience and I believe he may be behind Sansa\u2019s kidnapping story in season 8. He keeps making one mistake after the other, always believing to be smarter than the people around him, always under estimating the players of the game.</p><p>But I don\u2019t believe he will die. In the House videos released for season 8, they had the Lannisters brothers, Jaime and Tyrion, saying goodbye to each other and I believe we will see them say good bye one last time. I think Tyrion will be sent into exile to Essos, and banned from returning to Westeros.</p><p><br/></p><h2>CERSEI WILL DIE;</h2><p>There has been a lot of foreshadowing about Cersei death and its one of the events many believe it happen for sure. The show made sure to write us a scene when her ending is predicted.</p><p><br/></p><blockquote><p>\u201cI will hurt you for this. A day will come when you think you\u2019re safe and happy and your joy will turn to ashes in your mouth. And you will know the debt is paid.\u201d</p><p>(Tyrion - SEASON 2 EPISODE 8)</p><p><br/></p></blockquote><p><br/></p><p>This episode was written by George RRMartin himself, so, I always assumed this was Cersei Lannister ending\u2026 Then in season 7, we had Jon Snow threatening to kill Littlefinger is he ever touched Sansa. In that scene we have Jon Snow choking Baelish with his cold hands and I believe this scene could be a foreshadow of Jon finally killing Cersei, for trying to hurt Sansa in season 8. The prophecy says that Cersei will be killed by the \u201clittle brother\u201d and Jon Snow fits that role as the younger son of Rheagar Targaryen.</p><p>_______________________________________________________________</p><p><br/></p><h2>THEON WILL BE KING OF THE IRON ISLANDS;</h2><p>He lifted his head to look at her. &ldquo;Catelyn,&rdquo; he said. His voice was distant and formal. &ldquo;Where are the children?&rdquo;</p><p>A Game of Thrones - Catelyn I</p><p>I believe the children of Wintefell were always meant to be the heroes of this story. That\u2019s why George made sure to have a Greyjoy, a Targaryen be raised close to the Stark children. Those children now are gonna be the rulers of Westeros and they will be the ones passing Ned Stark legacy forward, building a new and better world.</p><p>Thast why I believe Theon will kill Euron Greyjoy and be the king of the Iron Islands; Theon probably has a bastard child with the captain\u2019s daughter he met in season 2 on his journey to Pike, he will recognize the child and raise them as his heir;</p><h2>A TIME FOR WOLVES;</h2><p><b><br/></b></p><figure data-orig-width=\"599\" data-orig-height=\"287\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e6eaee32c64120ed47c03b3bc7061f9d/tumblr_inline_pm5uvnO0W51sgp768_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"599\" data-orig-height=\"287\"/></figure><p><br/></p><p>It will be a Time for Wolves; a new period for Westeros. Jon will rule surrounded by Starks, carrying the Stark name with Sansa and Bran by his side; The capital will probably be transferred to HighGarden, not only the castle it is still intact but its also located in the most fertile area of Westeros. It seems like a very interesting political decision. Again, I found a lot of foreshadowing for this in the books.</p><p>Jon Snow will rule over a graveyard, as he predicted in season 7. But the ending will be very sweet, with kids playing around in gardens and celebrating. We will see Jon, the Stark kids, Jaime and Brienne, Sam and Guilly, Theon\u2026.. ect all enjoying spring and celebrating their happy ending.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><h2>THE VERY LAST SCENE OF THE STORY\u2026..</h2><p><br/></p><p>Daniel Abraham is the man responsible for converting the Game of Thrones book into a comic, mentioned that there is a particular line of dialog in the game of thrones book, which is very important for the last scene of &ldquo;A Dream of Spring&rdquo;.</p><p>Have you collaborated at all with George R.R. Martin in the process of adapting the novel to comics? If so, what\u2019s the creative process there?</p><p>Daniel: &ldquo;I\u2019ve spoken to George a lot in the process. The biggest issues we have are continuity questions. There are things about this story that only he knows, and they aren\u2019t all obvious. There was one scene I had to rework because there\u2019s a particular line of dialog \u2013 and you wouldn\u2019t know it to look at \u2013 that\u2019s important in the last scene of \u201cA Dream of Spring.\u201d- Daniel Abraham</p><p>On episode 1, when King Robert goes to visit Winterfell, he and Ned go down in the crypts to pay their respects to Lyanna Stark, the wolf girl he lost to Rheagar Targeryen. In that scene, the dialogue is different from what we have in the books.</p><p><br/></p><blockquote><p>ROBERT: Did you have to bury her in a place like this? She should be on a hill somewhere with the sun and the clouds above her.</p><p>NED: She was my sister. This is where she belongs.</p><p><br/></p></blockquote><p>In the books, this conversation is different:</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><blockquote><p>&quot;Ah, damn it, Ned, did you have to bury her in a place like this?&rdquo; His voice was hoarse with remembered grief. &ldquo;She deserved more than darkness \u2026&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She was a Stark of Winterfell,&rdquo; Ned said quietly. &ldquo;This is her place.&rdquo;</p><p>A Game of Thrones - Eddard I</p><p><br/></p></blockquote><p>I think this is the scene. I believe we will end this story with King Jon visiting his late wife Sansa Stark in the crypts of Winterfell and someone will ask him why did he buried her there, why not building a monument for her, so that she could be on display and that\u2019s how he will reply:<br/></p><p><br/></p><blockquote><p>She was a Stark of Winterfell, this is where she belongs\u2026.</p><p><br/></p></blockquote><p>What made me believe this, were two momments of the story: First of all, Lady\u2019s death. After Sansa direwolf is killed on her way to the south, Ned Stark makes sure to send a group of men back to the North and Winterfell, so that she can be buried in Northerner soil. Lady represented a little bit of Sansa, who died on that day and I dont think it was a silly detail George rrmartin make sure that her direwolf body was buried on Winterfell, I think that this scene, was much more important than most people think about it.</p><p><br/></p><blockquote><p>When it was over, he said, \u201cChoose four men and have them take the body north. <b>Bury her at Winterfell</b>.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll that way?\u201d Jory said, astonished.\u201cAll that way,\u201d Ned affirmed. \u201cThe Lannister woman shall never have this skin.\u201d</p><p>A Game of Thrones - Eddard III</p><p><br/></p></blockquote><p>Another momment in the story was Ygritte death. In both books and show, Jon Snow takes her body and goes to bury her up North, where she belonged.</p><p><br/></p><blockquote><p>Tormund: Did you love her? She loved you.</p><p>Jon: She told you?</p><p>Tormund: No. All she ever talked about was killing you. That\u2019s how I know. <b>She belongs in the North. The real North.</b> You understand me?</p><p><br/></p></blockquote><p><br/></p><p>Look at the excuse Tormund gives Jon to why Ygritte needs to be buried North of the Wall, its the same Ned Stark used to explain to King Robert why Lyanna had to be buried in the Crypts of Winterfell. Because thats where she belongs\u2026\u2026.</p><p>I also believe this ending could bring the story to a full circle, because there is also the theme of the audience never really thinking as Sansa as a TRUE STARK. There is still the notion that Sansa is not really a Stark like Jon or Arya.</p><p>Sansa Starkiness was always a topic of contention among fans of the books and series. Many like to refer to Sansa as Lady Lannister or Lady Bolton, so to have Sansa finally resting in the Winterfell crypts, by the end of this story, as a Stark, would be a very satisfying ending. Her hair maybe red and some of her manners may be more southern like, but Sansa IS A STARK.</p><p>And in fact, she is the Stark who took back the North and Winterfell, she is the Stark who made possible for the family to reunite and be safe; she is the Stark who stood by Jon side when he was made King in the North and supported his claim; she was the Stark who prepared the North for the wars and the winter and she will be the Stark who will rule the 7 Kingdoms together with her husband.</p><p>Both Jon and Sansa are foreshadowed to live very long lives and I expect their ruling period to last decades. They will be the ones restoring and rebuilding the kingdom after the wars of Ice and Fire. But I do believe Jon will live longer based on a quote from the books.</p><p><br/></p><blockquote><p>Tyrion shared around his skin of wine until even Yoren grew mellow. <b>One by one the company drifted off to their shelters and to sleep, all but Jon Snow, who had drawn the night\u2019s first watch.</b> Tyrion was the last to retire, as always. As he stepped into the shelter his men had built for him, he paused and looked back at Jon Snow. The boy stood near the fire, his face still and hard, looking deep into the flames. Tyrion Lannister smiled sadly and went to bed. -<br/>AGOT Tyrion II</p></blockquote><p><br/></p><p>And because of this line, I believe Jon Snow ill be the last one to die, he will live a very long life and will be forced to see all the ones he loved pass away, one by one.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><h2>THE END OF GAME OF THRONES\u2026</h2>",

Their romance has been foreshadow pretty much since book 1 and season 1 and their marriage will bring peace and prosperity to Westeros. The wars of Ice and Fire will destroy the kingdom and they will be the ones rebuilding the realm to its former glory; Jon and Sansa storyline are in a perfect parallel and they have been groomed to be king and queen of Westeros for the whole storyline in the books.</p><h2>JON SNOW HAS ALWAYS LOVED SANSA STARK;</h2><p><br></p><p>Jon Snow has always been in love with his cousin Sansa Stark, which is why he decided to go to the wall after Ned Stark accepted Sansa\u2019s engagement to Joffrey Baratheon. Jon was written as a mirror to Jaime Lannister and one of the reasons Jaime decided to join the kingsguard was because he could never marry his sister and lover Cersei. Once the secret of Lyanna and Rheagar is finally out, Jon and Sansa will be free to be together. Their love story is the main romance of the books.</p><p>BTW, don\u2019t be surprised if they reveal the romance between Jon and Sansa in the end of the first episode of season 8. The episode will start mirroring the pilot episode, when King Robert arrived at Winterfell with his Lannister family and we all know the episode ended with the reveal of Cersei and Jaime incestual romance.</p><p><br></p><h2>JON SNOW IS GOING TO BE A STARK;</h2><p>Jon Snow is going to take Sansa Stark name and pass the Stark name to all his children. He will be finally be a Stark and die as a true son by law of Eddard Stark, just like he always dreamed of in the books. This was foreshadowed in season 6 episode 5, when Sansa cloaked Jon Snow with a Stark Cloak.</p><p><br></p><h2>JON WILL FATHER A BASTARD</h2><p>Jon Snow will father a bastard. He will have trueborn sons with his wife Sansa Stark, but he will have a bastard girl with Daenerys. The books have foreshadowed this event to death. Jon and Sansa will pass this bastard girl as their own trueborn child and give her their Stark name. Sansa will raise this child as her own daughter and make her a Stark. That\u2019s why the show wrote that scene with Catelyn Stark and Talissa on season 3 where Catelyn says that she failed to love and care for her husband bastard child, Sansa will do the opposite and love and care for Jon\u2019s bastard daughter.</p><p>Jon will do the inverse of his uncle Ned, who lied and raised his trueborn nephew as a bastard. The story of Game of Thrones started with Ned Stark starting a war to prevent a bastard son of Cersei Lannister to sit in the Throne and it will end with a bastard daughter of Jon Snow as the heir of the Throne. History repeat itself and in the end, there wont be much difference between Starks and Lannister, they all lie to protect the ones they love.</p><p>\u201cThe things we do for love\u201d will still be the theme of the story in the end\u2026.</p><p><br></p><h2>THIS IS A STORY OF FATHER\u2019S DAUGHTERS\u2026.</h2><p><br></p><p>A SONG OF ICE AND FIRE its many tales in one; this is a tale of a Dragon prince madly in love with a Wolf girl; this is also a tale about home and families; about the things we do for love; it\u2019s a story about tyranny and fear; its also a story about slow learners, who make several mistakes, but that eventually do learn, but ALSO, A SONG OF ICE AND FIRE, is a story about father\u2019s daughters.</p><p>And that\u2019s exactly what Arya, Sansa, Cersei, Daenerys, Brienne all are. These women are their father\u2019s daughters. That\u2019s why the show gave so much importance on those character\u2019s fathers and hardly touched the mothers relevance.</p><p>No one thought Sansa and Daenerys had much of their fathers in themselves, those two characters were always associated with their mothers, yet they will prove to all of us that they carry much of Eddar and Aerys inside of them, in the last part of this story.</p><p><br></p><h2>THE STARK SISTERS WILL GET EVERYTHING THEY EVER WANTED\u2026</h2><blockquote><br></blockquote><p><br></p><figure data-orig-width=\"640\" data-orig-height=\"360\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/2f7beda43cf2d3363b1942b24764016c/tumblr_inline_pm5u2jBCaP1sgp768_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"640\" data-orig-height=\"360\"></figure><blockquote><p>Arya: \u201cWe both wanted to be the other people when we were younger. You wanted to be a queen and sit next to a handsome, young king on the Iron Throne. I wanted to be a knight, to pick up a sword like father and go off to battle. Neither of us got to be that other person, did we? The world doesnt just let girls decide what they are going to be.\u201d\u2019</p><p>(SEASON 7 EPISODE 6)</p><p><br></p></blockquote><h2>AND THEY ARE GOING TO BE QUEENS\u2026.</h2><p>Yes, we will have two queens. Game of Thrones started with two queens. Daenerys and Cersei; one a conqueror, the second a consort queen. Two women, whose obsession for the Iron Throne, left a trail of death and destruction on Essos and Westeros. So, we will finish this story with two queens, who will restore the Kingdom and improve the lives of their people. Sansa will be the consort queen of Jon Snow and Arya will be the warrior, the conquering queen that will lead the armies of North, Vale and Riverlands into war in season 8.</p><p><br></p><h2>SANSA STARK WILL BE \u201cTHE QUEEN\u201d;</h2><p><br></p><p>Queen Sansa Stark will change the Law of Succession allowing girls to be heirs in front of their younger brothers. Sansa it\u2019s the YMBQ of the prophecy and she will be the one casting Cersei Lannister down; Sansa will be very political active queen, changing laws and improving the lives of the people of Westeros and making important changes in the realm; She will be loved by her people and called THE QUEEN.</p><p>Sansa was always meant to be the final queen and the one who will rebuild the kingdom after the wars. Sansa entire storyline in the books was about observing the major players of the game make their moves and see the ramifications of those decisions. In Kings Landing, Sansa saw it first hand how ruling can affect the lives of the people in Westeros. She was able to see what to do, when in power, but also, what NOT to do as a king or queen. She learned a lot from Cersei, Margaery, Ollena, the Tyrells, The Lannisters, Littlefinger and will use this education for good use as a queen.</p><p>All Sansa\u2019s dreams will come true and she will be a living proof that \u201clife is a song\u201d. She will marry her brave and gentle hero; she will have children and rebuild her family and she will be a very beloved queen, admired for her beauty and kindness.</p><p><br></p><h2>ARYA WILL BE THE QUEEN IN THE NORTH;</h2><p><br></p><p>Arys Stark will rule the North as a Regent Queen. Arya storyline in season 8 will be a copy of Papa Ned in the first Rebellion against the Mad King. She will call the banners and lead the North armies into battle in the final war of this story. George RRMartin himself said that she would conquer the world in the final part of this tale.</p><p><br></p><h2>ARYA WILL BE VERY IMPORTANT IN THE FINAL SEASON !!!!!</h2><p><br></p><p>Arya is season 8 will be a huge warrior, with the help of Nymeria and their pack of wolves, she is going to lead their armies into battle, defeating Daenerys armies in combat (yes, the Dothraki bitches!!!!!!) They will probably meet in the Riverlands, where Rheagar and Robert had their first and final confrontation. She will be the one who will kill the mountain, avenging the people that he cruelly killed in the Riverlands and the Hound. Just like papa Ned became famous for killing Ser Arthur Dane, Arya will be legendary for killing the Mountain. They will write songs about her for years and years to come\u2026\u2026</p><p><br></p><h2>BRAN STARK WILL BE THE MAGICAL FORCE TO STOP THE ARMY OF THE DEAD\u2026</h2><h2><br></h2><figure data-orig-width=\"628\" data-orig-height=\"646\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/cb5a9eeba9a21e09fa027a4d5e29bee9/tumblr_inline_pm5u5aiMqM1sgp768_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"628\" data-orig-height=\"646\"></figure><h2><br></h2><p>I know the audience expects Daenerys and her dragons to be the magical force used to stop the Army of the Dead, but, don\u2019t be shocked if she decides to abandon the cause in the middle of the fight and leave the North before the big battle against the Night King. There is a lot of Stannis in Daenerys character arc on season 7 and in the end, Stannis left Jon and the Nights Watch on their own to fight the Night King on Hardhome, and went to march to Winterfell to fight the Boltons. Stannis could never let it go completely of the Iron Throne and I expect Dany to do the same.</p><p>Its Bran Stark, who has been preparing himself to face this threat since the beginning of this story. Its Bran Stark who has been foreshadowed by the books and tv show to be the one who will matter the most in the end. Not the dragons. I suspect we will see the ghosts of the Kings of Winter, coming out from the crypts of Winterfell, to fight the final battle against the Army of the Dead.</p><p>Bran: What else have you seen it? Jojen: The ONLY think that matters. YOU.</p><p>(Season 3 Episode 2)</p><p>Also, in the first Long Night, there was no Targaryens; The North was left to fight on its own with the help of the Children of the Forest and George likes to repeat his stories very closely to the original. Defeating the Army of the Dead wont be Bran only job in season 8, he has also been written as a foil to Daenerys, so I believe he will be involved on her final defeat.</p><p><br></p><h2>DAENERYS WILL BE THE FINAL ANTAGONIST IN SEASON 8 AND WE WILL HAVE A SECOND DANCE OF DRAGONS BETWEEN JON AND DANY\u2026\u2026</h2><p><br></p><figure data-orig-width=\"750\" data-orig-height=\"563\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/21fdccfff8b756b781f5c03f45e95a7e/tumblr_inline_pm5u5w9MAV1sgp768_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"750\" data-orig-height=\"563\"></figure><h2><br></h2><blockquote><p>Jon Snow: <b>\u201cThey will see it you for \u201cwhat you are\u201d.</b></p><p><b>(</b>SEASON 7 EPISODE 6)</p><p><br></p></blockquote><p>In the beginning of this story we saw Sansa Stark falling madly in love with a beautiful prince, only to have her heart broken in a million of pieces in the end of season 1, when Joffrey shocked her by cutting her father\u2019s head, finally showing how cruel and monstrous he really was. In the beginning of the series, we also had the audience falling madly in love with the beautiful Daenerys Targaryen, believing she was the hero of this story and just like Sansa, the audience will be shocked by Daenerys actions in season 8 and they will have their hearts completely broken in a million of pieces. Daenerys will finally show to the audience the monster that she really is. I expect to see a lot of shades of Joffrey on Daenerys in season 8. Remember, Joffrey believed his whole life he was the true heir of the Iron Throne, until a Stark man showed up in his life, telling him that this was a lie. This is exactely what is going to happen to Daenerys in season 8.</p><p>Remember when Sansa Stark fell madly in love with a monster and trusted a beautiful queen blindly when she was warned against it? You are all Sansas, you just don\u2019t know yet.</p><p>Daenerys could never be the villain of her own story. That\u2019s why it was always necessary for her to create a lie that painted her as the hero. She invaded Astapor to save the Unsulied from the evil wise masters; she conquered Meereen to pay back the slavers for crucifying the children slaves; she destroyed the sacred temple of Vaes Dothrak and killed all the Khalls, but she did for the Dothraki widows who didnt wish to stay in the Dosh khaleen. Now in Westeros she had no more excuses, there is no slavery or evil masters torturing young boys in the 7 Kingdoms, so she was forced to create a new excuse to defend her invasion of Westeros.</p><p>So, she told the audience that she wants to break the wheel of power that crushes the poor and the weak on Westeros. It makes no sense of course. She wants to break the wheel, by building a new wheel, this time, with only her family on top, crushing those under her. This is a phony ridiculous excuse and its supposed to be ridiculous. It\u2019s a silly lie, all Daenerys wants in the Iron Throne, but she cant admit it afraid it will make her look bad, so she created this silly little lie and the audience (just like Sansa fell into Cersei silly lies in season 1) fell right into. What Dany really wants is install an absolute monarchy, with only HER in power.</p><p>Daenerys is a false prophet, who invented a sacred mission to convince her people and those who follow her of her good intentions, yet all her actions are motivated from the desire to take The Iron Throne, that\u2019s the one thing who truly matters for Daenerys and now in season 8, when her claim to the Throne will be contested by the bombastic news of Jon Snow stronger claim to the Throne. That\u2019s whe she will finally show to the audience who she really is.</p><p><br></p><h2>WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE BLINDLY FOLLOW, GOD AND HEROS;</h2><p><br></p><p>By writing Daenerys Targaryen, George RRMartin wanted to show us how dictators and cult leaders are created. They started magical and inspiring, making beautiful speeches and promising great things, but in end, most of them are motivated by selfish desires and allow power to corrupt them. Daenerys story is also a warning about following leaders without questioning their motivations or decisions. Daenerys is adored as a goddess by her followers and never has her decision questioned by them. Unlike Jon Snow who is always questioned by Sansa, The North Lords and the Wildlings about his decisions. The Dothraki and the Unsullied just blindly follow Daenerys around, like children following their mothers, never questioning her real motives, or even contemplating if the move to Westeros has actually any benefits for them. And as we are about to see in season 8, following leaders blindly can be a very dangerous thing because it can lead us to our graves. The audience, the Dothraki and the Unsullied never thought that their hero could just simply be lying to them\u2026\u2026No matter how much destruction and death she causes, her followers and advisers keep believing in her, defending her decisions, turning a blind eye to her questionable actions, finding excuses to her terrible acts. They know that she can be impulsive and dangerous but believe that in the end she is motivated by great ideals and will always listen to her advisers\u2026\u2026..</p><p>Daenerys first instinct is always destruction and violence, but most of the time, she is restrained by her advisers\u2026\u2026\u2026. But the rope that holds her together is about to be ripped apart in season 8.</p><p><br></p><blockquote><p>Daario Naharis: <b>\u201cI pity the Lords of Westeros, they have no idea what is coming for them\u201d</b></p><p>(SEASON 6 EPISODE 10)</p><p><br></p></blockquote><p>Daenerys was always meant to be the final antagonist of the story, her time in Essos was not about learning to be a good queen, she was learning to be a ruthless conqueror, which she learned very well. Don\u2019t be surprised if she marries Euron Greyjoy, they marriage has been foreshadowed on books and tv show. Daenerys its gonna shock the audience, she is going to behave in a way that will surprise a lot of people.<br></p><p>Jon and Daenerys relationship will mirror Rhaenyra and Aegon tragic battle for the Throne; This will be the final battle on episode 5, the fight for the Throne has always been the main focus of the story and this battle its what is going to put an end to this tale. Westeros will finally be united against the common enemy, which is Daenerys and her dragons.</p><p>The Army of the Dead and the Night King were always a red herring, its was always Daenerys and her dragons the major threat for Westeros. I believe that more than half of the population of Westeros will perish during the final wars; many who survive the war will latter die during the winter without the food that was destroyed by Daenerys dragons in the Field of Fire 2.0; in her short period in Westeros, Daenerys will cause a lot of deaths and destruction and she will be remembered as the Queen of Ashes.</p><p>The stallion that mounts the world was never Rhaego. It was always going to be Daenerys. Essos will also be throw into chaos, without Daenerys dragons to impose order, the masters of Astapor, Meereen and the local cities will raise again and the region will probably be engulfed into a civil war. It will probably take centuries for the world to recover from Daenerys reign of terror.</p><p><br></p><h2>WINTER WILL COME TO HOUSE TARGARYEN;</h2><p><b><br></b></p><p>Daenerys final battle on episode 5, will turn Kings Landing into ashes, but she wont be destroying just the capital of the realm, she will also put an end to House Targaryen. Their dynasty started with the destruction of Harrenhall and will end with the destruction of the capital that The Targaryens themselves build, closing a cycle of tyranny, fear and terror. Daenerys will be the last dragon.</p><h2>DRAGONSTONE WILL FAIL;</h2><p><br></p><figure data-orig-width=\"2000\" data-orig-height=\"1120\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/31e728bb18f6e03ee2f8869ca038918f/tumblr_inline_pm5u98wcWp1sgp768_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"2000\" data-orig-height=\"1120\"></figure><h2><br></h2><p>I believe that Dragonstone will be destroyed in the end. The Castle in the remote island serves no purpose for Westeros. It can not be used for grains production or animal livestock, the only use for Dragonstone in the past centuries was to be used as base for a foreign invasion, the castle will probably be destroyed in the end. Also important, Daenerys spent this entire story threatening to destroy other\u2019s peoples houses and cities. To have her own ancestral House destroyed in the end would be very fitting to the story.<br></p><p><br></p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cso comes snow, after fire and even dragons have their ending\u201d\u00a0</i></p><p>J. R.R TOKIEN</p></blockquote><p><br></p><h2>WE WILL HAVE A SECOND REBELLION AND A SECOND DANCE OF THE DRAGONS\u2026</h2><p><br></p><blockquote><p>Don\u2019t fight in the North. Or the South. Fight every battle, everywhere, always, in your mind. Everyone is your enemy, everyone is your friend\u2026 every possible series of events is happening all at once. Live that way and nothing will surprise you, \u2026\u2026..everything that happens will be something that you have seen before.</p><p>(Litllefinger SEASON 7 EPISODE 2)</p><p><br></p></blockquote><p><br></p><p>Everything that happened in the past will happen again in season 8. Robert\u2019s Rebelion will happen again. Sansa will be kidnapped at some point, just like aunt Lyanna Stark; Arya will lead the North armies south to save her sister (just like Ned Stark did in Robert\u2019s Rebellion). The Riverlands, the North and the Vale will once again gather forces and go to war.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><blockquote><p>Stannis: \u201cWhat are you reading?\u201d</p><p>Shireen: <b>\u201cThe Dance of Dragons.\u201d</b></p><p>Stannis: \u201cWhat\u2019s it about? It\u2019s the story of the fight between Rhaenyra Targaryen and her half-brother Aegon for control over the Seven Kingdoms. Both of them thought they belonged on the Iron Throne. When people started declaring for one of them or the other, their fight divided the kingdoms in two. <b>Brothers fought brothers, dragons fought dragons. By the time it was over, thousands were dead. And it was a disaster for the Targaryens as well. They never truly recovered.</b></p><p>(GAME OF THRONES SEASON 5 EPISODE 9)</p><p><br></p><p><br></p></blockquote><p>We will have a second Dance of Dragons, with the kingdom divided between Jon Snow and Daenerys Targaryen. The Lannisters will be divided too by this war. Tyrion (the flop) will choose Daenerys side and Jaime will choose Jon Snow and the Starks. This will be the decision that will change Jaime Lannister legacy forever.</p><p>Millions will die, but in the end Jon Snow and his armies will defeat Daenerys and her dragons. This war will not only destroy the realm but finally bring an end to the Targaryen dynasty. This battle will probably happens on episode 5.</p><p><br></p><h2>SANSA\u2019S PLANS TO CAST DOWN CERSEI\u2026</h2><p><br></p><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"287\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/606011674977c01975eb40f294e3fd29/tumblr_inline_pm5uanuNnL1sgp768_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"287\"></figure><h2><br></h2><h2><br></h2><p>Sansa will be kidnapped in season 8, probably by Cersei, but don\u2019t be surprised if this kidnapping has a twist. In season 1, in the scene where Cersei and the small council is forcing Sansa to write down a letter to Rob Stark demanding him to bend the knee to King Joffrey., we have Maester Pycelle warning Cersei that Sansa may be so sweet and innocent now, but once she is older, she may hatch some treasons!!!!</p><blockquote><p>\u201cshe (Sansa) may be a sweet thing now Your Grace, but in 10 YEARS, who knows what treasons she may hatch!!!!\u201d</p><p>(SEASON 1 EPISODE 8)</p><p><br></p></blockquote><p>Now, we know that Sansa did learn a lot from Cersei and maybe now she is finally ready to outsmart her former teacher\u2026 This was the first foreshadowing of Sansa\u2019s plans to cast down Cersei.</p><p>And in season 6, we have another foreshadowing of how Sansa will plot against Cersei in the end, When Arya is in Braavos, she watches a Bravossi Theather play telling the events that happened in Westeros. In that storyline, the actress that plays Sansa hires a faceless man to kill the actress who plays Cersei, Lady Crane. I believe this was another foreshadowing of the events that will happen in season 8. Its Sansa who is taking Cersei down. The little dove will prove to the queen that she learned all her lessons. But I believe Jon Snow will be the one killing Cersei.</p><p><br></p><h2>EPISODE 5 WILL BE THE DANCE OF DRAGONS;</h2><p><br></p><blockquote><p>He was no dragon, Dany thought, curiously calm. Fire cannot kill a dragon.</p><p>(A Game of Thrones - Daenerys V)</p><p><br></p></blockquote><p><br></p><p>Well I believe thats exactly whats its gonna happen. In order to defeat Daenerys you have to kill her last dragon, Drogon, which we know will be flying over Kings Landing in the end of this story. Thats how the wildfire comes in. I actually think Jon and the Lannisters may set a trap for Dany and use the wildfire to kill the dragon and Daenery\u2019s remain armies. Maybe Bran was behind King Aerys decision to cover KL with wildfire, already preparing to use against Daenerys in the finall battle for the Throne. if we rewatch season 5 episode 7 we had a little hint about this idea.</p><p><br></p><blockquote><p>DAARIO: On the day of the Great Games, gather all the great masters, and wise masters, and worthy masters you can find, and slaughter them all.</p><p>DAENERYS: I am a queen. Not a butcher.</p><p>DAARIO: All rulers are either butchers or meat.</p><p><br></p></blockquote><p><br></p><p>Remember that Bran\u2019s first chapter he is forced to watch his father doing the Kings\u2019s justice and Ned explains to him that \u201cthe man who passes the sentence, must swing the sword\u201d. This is one of the most important themes in the story.</p><p>Also, in season 4 episode 2, we have Bran having a vision of the events that will happen for the first time. This is THE vision where he sees the dragon flying over KL. After the vision he tells Jojen and Meera: \u201cI know where we have to go\u201d. The show then cuts to a scene in Kings Landing.</p><p>So, I do believe Bran will be involved with the explosion of Kings Landing and using the wildfire as a last weapon to defeat Daenerys and her last dragon. Thats the only way Westeros will ever be free of the Targaryens.</p><p>BTW, gathering all your enemies in a closed space and destroying them with fire has been used by both mad queens, Cersei and Daenerys, so maybe now we will see the Starks using this idea to finally get rid of Daenerys, her armies and her dragon.</p><p><br></p><h2>THE FUTURE OF HOUSE LANNISTER</h2><p>No, House Lannister will not fall into nothing like the Targaryens. The House will be saved by Jaime Lannister, who will marry Brienne of Tarth and restore his family and legacy.</p><p><br></p><h2>JAIME LANNISTER ITS GOING TO BE THE FINAL HAND AND ITS GOING TO END THIS STORY AS A GREAT HERO;</h2><p><br></p><figure data-orig-width=\"980\" data-orig-height=\"490\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/73b5389c30d8ef91064c03b6c0a5f945/tumblr_inline_pm5ueyWqgV1sgp768_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"980\" data-orig-height=\"490\"></figure><p>Jaime Lannister will choose Jon Snow, this will be the turning point for Jaime and the choice that will change his legacy. There is some very good foreshadowing in the books that hint to us that Jaime will side with Jon Snow in the final battle and help him to defeat Daenerys and her dragons.<br></p><p>I believe it will be Jaime who will kill Daenerys last dragon, Drogon, and becoming famous as a DRAGONSLAYER; Jaime Lannister will have a big role in the final part of this story, not only helping defeat the ARMY OF THE DEAD, but also defeating Daenerys Targaryen and saving the Kingdom once again from a tyrannical Targaryen; only this time he will finally receive the thank you, from the people of Westeros;</p><p>Jaime will be greeted as a hero and will end this story beloved and admired by the people. I believe at some point in season 8 Jaime will die and will be brought back to life, his character was written as a mirror to Jon Snow and Jon died on season 5, so this storyline may be possible.</p><p>Jaime will be the Hand of the King for Jon Snow (there is a lot of foreshadowing for this, in both books and tv show) and he will be able to finish his history in the white book as a hero. He will go down in history as one of the greatest Hands in the history of the 7 kingdoms. Jaime will be the last Lannister left on Westeros.</p><p><br></p><h2>TYRION WILL BE SENT INTO EXILE;</h2><p><br></p><p>Tyrion will have to face a trial for a third time and this time he will be guilty of his crimes. Yeah, that is not a prediction, it\u2019s a spoiler, but I already expected that. George loves his 3. Tyrion its one of the characters that will have a very tragic ending. He was the fool who brought Daenerys to Westeros believing he could control her, the same mistake his sister Cersei tried to do with Joffrey. He invited Jon Snow under false premises to Dragonstone without mentioning to Jon about Daenerys demands to bend the knee.</p><p>He made a deal with Cersei that was never disclosed to the audience and I believe he may be behind Sansa\u2019s kidnapping story in season 8. He keeps making one mistake after the other, always believing to be smarter than the people around him, always under estimating the players of the game.</p><p>But I don\u2019t believe he will die. In the House videos released for season 8, they had the Lannisters brothers, Jaime and Tyrion, saying goodbye to each other and I believe we will see them say good bye one last time. I think Tyrion will be sent into exile to Essos, and banned from returning to Westeros.</p><p><br></p><h2>CERSEI WILL DIE;</h2><p>There has been a lot of foreshadowing about Cersei death and its one of the events many believe it happen for sure. The show made sure to write us a scene when her ending is predicted.</p><p><br></p><blockquote><p>\u201cI will hurt you for this. A day will come when you think you\u2019re safe and happy and your joy will turn to ashes in your mouth. And you will know the debt is paid.\u201d</p><p>(Tyrion - SEASON 2 EPISODE 8)</p><p><br></p></blockquote><p><br></p><p>This episode was written by George RRMartin himself, so, I always assumed this was Cersei Lannister ending\u2026 Then in season 7, we had Jon Snow threatening to kill Littlefinger is he ever touched Sansa. In that scene we have Jon Snow choking Baelish with his cold hands and I believe this scene could be a foreshadow of Jon finally killing Cersei, for trying to hurt Sansa in season 8. The prophecy says that Cersei will be killed by the \u201clittle brother\u201d and Jon Snow fits that role as the younger son of Rheagar Targaryen.</p><p>_______________________________________________________________</p><p><br></p><h2>THEON WILL BE KING OF THE IRON ISLANDS;</h2><p>He lifted his head to look at her. \u201cCatelyn,\u201d he said. His voice was distant and formal. \u201cWhere are the children?\u201d</p><p>A Game of Thrones - Catelyn I</p><p>I believe the children of Wintefell were always meant to be the heroes of this story. That\u2019s why George made sure to have a Greyjoy, a Targaryen be raised close to the Stark children. Those children now are gonna be the rulers of Westeros and they will be the ones passing Ned Stark legacy forward, building a new and better world.</p><p>Thast why I believe Theon will kill Euron Greyjoy and be the king of the Iron Islands; Theon probably has a bastard child with the captain\u2019s daughter he met in season 2 on his journey to Pike, he will recognize the child and raise them as his heir;</p><h2>A TIME FOR WOLVES;</h2><p><b><br></b></p><figure data-orig-width=\"599\" data-orig-height=\"287\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e6eaee32c64120ed47c03b3bc7061f9d/tumblr_inline_pm5uvnO0W51sgp768_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"599\" data-orig-height=\"287\"></figure><p><br></p><p>It will be a Time for Wolves; a new period for Westeros. Jon will rule surrounded by Starks, carrying the Stark name with Sansa and Bran by his side; The capital will probably be transferred to HighGarden, not only the castle it is still intact but its also located in the most fertile area of Westeros. It seems like a very interesting political decision. Again, I found a lot of foreshadowing for this in the books.</p><p>Jon Snow will rule over a graveyard, as he predicted in season 7. But the ending will be very sweet, with kids playing around in gardens and celebrating. We will see Jon, the Stark kids, Jaime and Brienne, Sam and Guilly, Theon\u2026.. ect all enjoying spring and celebrating their happy ending.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><h2>THE VERY LAST SCENE OF THE STORY\u2026..</h2><p><br></p><p>Daniel Abraham is the man responsible for converting the Game of Thrones book into a comic, mentioned that there is a particular line of dialog in the game of thrones book, which is very important for the last scene of \u201cA Dream of Spring\u201d.</p><p>Have you collaborated at all with George R.R. Martin in the process of adapting the novel to comics? If so, what\u2019s the creative process there?</p><p>Daniel: \u201cI\u2019ve spoken to George a lot in the process. The biggest issues we have are continuity questions. There are things about this story that only he knows, and they aren\u2019t all obvious. There was one scene I had to rework because there\u2019s a particular line of dialog \u2013 and you wouldn\u2019t know it to look at \u2013 that\u2019s important in the last scene of \u201cA Dream of Spring.\u201d- Daniel Abraham</p><p>On episode 1, when King Robert goes to visit Winterfell, he and Ned go down in the crypts to pay their respects to Lyanna Stark, the wolf girl he lost to Rheagar Targeryen. In that scene, the dialogue is different from what we have in the books.</p><p><br></p><blockquote><p>ROBERT: Did you have to bury her in a place like this? She should be on a hill somewhere with the sun and the clouds above her.</p><p>NED: She was my sister. This is where she belongs.</p><p><br></p></blockquote><p>In the books, this conversation is different:</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><blockquote><p>\"Ah, damn it, Ned, did you have to bury her in a place like this?\u201d His voice was hoarse with remembered grief. \u201cShe deserved more than darkness \u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was a Stark of Winterfell,\u201d Ned said quietly. \u201cThis is her place.\u201d</p><p>A Game of Thrones - Eddard I</p><p><br></p></blockquote><p>I think this is the scene. I believe we will end this story with King Jon visiting his late wife Sansa Stark in the crypts of Winterfell and someone will ask him why did he buried her there, why not building a monument for her, so that she could be on display and that\u2019s how he will reply:<br></p><p><br></p><blockquote><p>She was a Stark of Winterfell, this is where she belongs\u2026.</p><p><br></p></blockquote><p>What made me believe this, were two momments of the story: First of all, Lady\u2019s death. After Sansa direwolf is killed on her way to the south, Ned Stark makes sure to send a group of men back to the North and Winterfell, so that she can be buried in Northerner soil. Lady represented a little bit of Sansa, who died on that day and I dont think it was a silly detail George rrmartin make sure that her direwolf body was buried on Winterfell, I think that this scene, was much more important than most people think about it.</p><p><br></p><blockquote><p>When it was over, he said, \u201cChoose four men and have them take the body north. <b>Bury her at Winterfell</b>.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll that way?\u201d Jory said, astonished.\u201cAll that way,\u201d Ned affirmed. \u201cThe Lannister woman shall never have this skin.\u201d</p><p>A Game of Thrones - Eddard III</p><p><br></p></blockquote><p>Another momment in the story was Ygritte death. In both books and show, Jon Snow takes her body and goes to bury her up North, where she belonged.</p><p><br></p><blockquote><p>Tormund: Did you love her? She loved you.</p><p>Jon: She told you?</p><p>Tormund: No. All she ever talked about was killing you. That\u2019s how I know. <b>She belongs in the North. The real North.</b> You understand me?</p><p><br></p></blockquote><p><br></p><p>Look at the excuse Tormund gives Jon to why Ygritte needs to be buried North of the Wall, its the same Ned Stark used to explain to King Robert why Lyanna had to be buried in the Crypts of Winterfell. Because thats where she belongs\u2026\u2026.</p><p>I also believe this ending could bring the story to a full circle, because there is also the theme of the audience never really thinking as Sansa as a TRUE STARK. There is still the notion that Sansa is not really a Stark like Jon or Arya.</p><p>Sansa Starkiness was always a topic of contention among fans of the books and series. Many like to refer to Sansa as Lady Lannister or Lady Bolton, so to have Sansa finally resting in the Winterfell crypts, by the end of this story, as a Stark, would be a very satisfying ending. Her hair maybe red and some of her manners may be more southern like, but Sansa IS A STARK.</p><p>And in fact, she is the Stark who took back the North and Winterfell, she is the Stark who made possible for the family to reunite and be safe; she is the Stark who stood by Jon side when he was made King in the North and supported his claim; she was the Stark who prepared the North for the wars and the winter and she will be the Stark who will rule the 7 Kingdoms together with her husband.</p><p>Both Jon and Sansa are foreshadowed to live very long lives and I expect their ruling period to last decades. They will be the ones restoring and rebuilding the kingdom after the wars of Ice and Fire. But I do believe Jon will live longer based on a quote from the books.</p><p><br></p><blockquote><p>Tyrion shared around his skin of wine until even Yoren grew mellow. <b>One by one the company drifted off to their shelters and to sleep, all but Jon Snow, who had drawn the night\u2019s first watch.</b> Tyrion was the last to retire, as always. As he stepped into the shelter his men had built for him, he paused and looked back at Jon Snow. The boy stood near the fire, his face still and hard, looking deep into the flames. Tyrion Lannister smiled sadly and went to bed. -<br>AGOT Tyrion II</p></blockquote><p><br></p><p>And because of this line, I believe Jon Snow ill be the last one to die, he will live a very long life and will be forced to see all the ones he loved pass away, one by one.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><h2>THE END OF GAME OF THRONES\u2026</h2></p>",

Their romance has been foreshadow pretty much since book 1 and season 1 and their marriage will bring peace and prosperity to Westeros. The wars of Ice and Fire will destroy the kingdom and they will be the ones rebuilding the realm to its former glory; Jon and Sansa storyline are in a perfect parallel and they have been groomed to be king and queen of Westeros for the whole storyline in the books.</p><h2>JON SNOW HAS ALWAYS LOVED SANSA STARK;</h2><p><br></p><p>Jon Snow has always been in love with his cousin Sansa Stark, which is why he decided to go to the wall after Ned Stark accepted Sansa\u2019s engagement to Joffrey Baratheon. Jon was written as a mirror to Jaime Lannister and one of the reasons Jaime decided to join the kingsguard was because he could never marry his sister and lover Cersei. Once the secret of Lyanna and Rheagar is finally out, Jon and Sansa will be free to be together. Their love story is the main romance of the books.</p><p>BTW, don\u2019t be surprised if they reveal the romance between Jon and Sansa in the end of the first episode of season 8. The episode will start mirroring the pilot episode, when King Robert arrived at Winterfell with his Lannister family and we all know the episode ended with the reveal of Cersei and Jaime incestual romance.</p><p><br></p><h2>JON SNOW IS GOING TO BE A STARK;</h2><p>Jon Snow is going to take Sansa Stark name and pass the Stark name to all his children. He will be finally be a Stark and die as a true son by law of Eddard Stark, just like he always dreamed of in the books. This was foreshadowed in season 6 episode 5, when Sansa cloaked Jon Snow with a Stark Cloak.</p><p><br></p><h2>JON WILL FATHER A BASTARD</h2><p>Jon Snow will father a bastard. He will have trueborn sons with his wife Sansa Stark, but he will have a bastard girl with Daenerys. The books have foreshadowed this event to death. Jon and Sansa will pass this bastard girl as their own trueborn child and give her their Stark name. Sansa will raise this child as her own daughter and make her a Stark. That\u2019s why the show wrote that scene with Catelyn Stark and Talissa on season 3 where Catelyn says that she failed to love and care for her husband bastard child, Sansa will do the opposite and love and care for Jon\u2019s bastard daughter.</p><p>Jon will do the inverse of his uncle Ned, who lied and raised his trueborn nephew as a bastard. The story of Game of Thrones started with Ned Stark starting a war to prevent a bastard son of Cersei Lannister to sit in the Throne and it will end with a bastard daughter of Jon Snow as the heir of the Throne. History repeat itself and in the end, there wont be much difference between Starks and Lannister, they all lie to protect the ones they love.</p><p>\u201cThe things we do for love\u201d will still be the theme of the story in the end\u2026.</p><p><br></p><h2>THIS IS A STORY OF FATHER\u2019S DAUGHTERS\u2026.</h2><p><br></p><p>A SONG OF ICE AND FIRE its many tales in one; this is a tale of a Dragon prince madly in love with a Wolf girl; this is also a tale about home and families; about the things we do for love; it\u2019s a story about tyranny and fear; its also a story about slow learners, who make several mistakes, but that eventually do learn, but ALSO, A SONG OF ICE AND FIRE, is a story about father\u2019s daughters.</p><p>And that\u2019s exactly what Arya, Sansa, Cersei, Daenerys, Brienne all are. These women are their father\u2019s daughters. That\u2019s why the show gave so much importance on those character\u2019s fathers and hardly touched the mothers relevance.</p><p>No one thought Sansa and Daenerys had much of their fathers in themselves, those two characters were always associated with their mothers, yet they will prove to all of us that they carry much of Eddar and Aerys inside of them, in the last part of this story.</p><p><br></p><h2>THE STARK SISTERS WILL GET EVERYTHING THEY EVER WANTED\u2026</h2><blockquote><br></blockquote><p><br></p><figure data-orig-width=\"640\" data-orig-height=\"360\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/2f7beda43cf2d3363b1942b24764016c/tumblr_inline_pm5u2jBCaP1sgp768_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"640\" data-orig-height=\"360\"></figure><blockquote><p>Arya: \u201cWe both wanted to be the other people when we were younger. You wanted to be a queen and sit next to a handsome, young king on the Iron Throne. I wanted to be a knight, to pick up a sword like father and go off to battle. Neither of us got to be that other person, did we? The world doesnt just let girls decide what they are going to be.\u201d\u2019</p><p>(SEASON 7 EPISODE 6)</p><p><br></p></blockquote><h2>AND THEY ARE GOING TO BE QUEENS\u2026.</h2><p>Yes, we will have two queens. Game of Thrones started with two queens. Daenerys and Cersei; one a conqueror, the second a consort queen. Two women, whose obsession for the Iron Throne, left a trail of death and destruction on Essos and Westeros. So, we will finish this story with two queens, who will restore the Kingdom and improve the lives of their people. Sansa will be the consort queen of Jon Snow and Arya will be the warrior, the conquering queen that will lead the armies of North, Vale and Riverlands into war in season 8.</p><p><br></p><h2>SANSA STARK WILL BE \u201cTHE QUEEN\u201d;</h2><p><br></p><p>Queen Sansa Stark will change the Law of Succession allowing girls to be heirs in front of their younger brothers. Sansa it\u2019s the YMBQ of the prophecy and she will be the one casting Cersei Lannister down; Sansa will be very political active queen, changing laws and improving the lives of the people of Westeros and making important changes in the realm; She will be loved by her people and called THE QUEEN.</p><p>Sansa was always meant to be the final queen and the one who will rebuild the kingdom after the wars. Sansa entire storyline in the books was about observing the major players of the game make their moves and see the ramifications of those decisions. In Kings Landing, Sansa saw it first hand how ruling can affect the lives of the people in Westeros. She was able to see what to do, when in power, but also, what NOT to do as a king or queen. She learned a lot from Cersei, Margaery, Ollena, the Tyrells, The Lannisters, Littlefinger and will use this education for good use as a queen.</p><p>All Sansa\u2019s dreams will come true and she will be a living proof that \u201clife is a song\u201d. She will marry her brave and gentle hero; she will have children and rebuild her family and she will be a very beloved queen, admired for her beauty and kindness.</p><p><br></p><h2>ARYA WILL BE THE QUEEN IN THE NORTH;</h2><p><br></p><p>Arys Stark will rule the North as a Regent Queen. Arya storyline in season 8 will be a copy of Papa Ned in the first Rebellion against the Mad King. She will call the banners and lead the North armies into battle in the final war of this story. George RRMartin himself said that she would conquer the world in the final part of this tale.</p><p><br></p><h2>ARYA WILL BE VERY IMPORTANT IN THE FINAL SEASON !!!!!</h2><p><br></p><p>Arya is season 8 will be a huge warrior, with the help of Nymeria and their pack of wolves, she is going to lead their armies into battle, defeating Daenerys armies in combat (yes, the Dothraki bitches!!!!!!) They will probably meet in the Riverlands, where Rheagar and Robert had their first and final confrontation. She will be the one who will kill the mountain, avenging the people that he cruelly killed in the Riverlands and the Hound. Just like papa Ned became famous for killing Ser Arthur Dane, Arya will be legendary for killing the Mountain. They will write songs about her for years and years to come\u2026\u2026</p><p><br></p><h2>BRAN STARK WILL BE THE MAGICAL FORCE TO STOP THE ARMY OF THE DEAD\u2026</h2><h2><br></h2><figure data-orig-width=\"628\" data-orig-height=\"646\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/cb5a9eeba9a21e09fa027a4d5e29bee9/tumblr_inline_pm5u5aiMqM1sgp768_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"628\" data-orig-height=\"646\"></figure><h2><br></h2><p>I know the audience expects Daenerys and her dragons to be the magical force used to stop the Army of the Dead, but, don\u2019t be shocked if she decides to abandon the cause in the middle of the fight and leave the North before the big battle against the Night King. There is a lot of Stannis in Daenerys character arc on season 7 and in the end, Stannis left Jon and the Nights Watch on their own to fight the Night King on Hardhome, and went to march to Winterfell to fight the Boltons. Stannis could never let it go completely of the Iron Throne and I expect Dany to do the same.</p><p>Its Bran Stark, who has been preparing himself to face this threat since the beginning of this story. Its Bran Stark who has been foreshadowed by the books and tv show to be the one who will matter the most in the end. Not the dragons. I suspect we will see the ghosts of the Kings of Winter, coming out from the crypts of Winterfell, to fight the final battle against the Army of the Dead.</p><p>Bran: What else have you seen it? Jojen: The ONLY think that matters. YOU.</p><p>(Season 3 Episode 2)</p><p>Also, in the first Long Night, there was no Targaryens; The North was left to fight on its own with the help of the Children of the Forest and George likes to repeat his stories very closely to the original. Defeating the Army of the Dead wont be Bran only job in season 8, he has also been written as a foil to Daenerys, so I believe he will be involved on her final defeat.</p><p><br></p><h2>DAENERYS WILL BE THE FINAL ANTAGONIST IN SEASON 8 AND WE WILL HAVE A SECOND DANCE OF DRAGONS BETWEEN JON AND DANY\u2026\u2026</h2><p><br></p><figure data-orig-width=\"750\" data-orig-height=\"563\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/21fdccfff8b756b781f5c03f45e95a7e/tumblr_inline_pm5u5w9MAV1sgp768_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"750\" data-orig-height=\"563\"></figure><h2><br></h2><blockquote><p>Jon Snow: <b>\u201cThey will see it you for \u201cwhat you are\u201d.</b></p><p><b>(</b>SEASON 7 EPISODE 6)</p><p><br></p></blockquote><p>In the beginning of this story we saw Sansa Stark falling madly in love with a beautiful prince, only to have her heart broken in a million of pieces in the end of season 1, when Joffrey shocked her by cutting her father\u2019s head, finally showing how cruel and monstrous he really was. In the beginning of the series, we also had the audience falling madly in love with the beautiful Daenerys Targaryen, believing she was the hero of this story and just like Sansa, the audience will be shocked by Daenerys actions in season 8 and they will have their hearts completely broken in a million of pieces. Daenerys will finally show to the audience the monster that she really is. I expect to see a lot of shades of Joffrey on Daenerys in season 8. Remember, Joffrey believed his whole life he was the true heir of the Iron Throne, until a Stark man showed up in his life, telling him that this was a lie. This is exactely what is going to happen to Daenerys in season 8.</p><p>Remember when Sansa Stark fell madly in love with a monster and trusted a beautiful queen blindly when she was warned against it? You are all Sansas, you just don\u2019t know yet.</p><p>Daenerys could never be the villain of her own story. That\u2019s why it was always necessary for her to create a lie that painted her as the hero. She invaded Astapor to save the Unsulied from the evil wise masters; she conquered Meereen to pay back the slavers for crucifying the children slaves; she destroyed the sacred temple of Vaes Dothrak and killed all the Khalls, but she did for the Dothraki widows who didnt wish to stay in the Dosh khaleen. Now in Westeros she had no more excuses, there is no slavery or evil masters torturing young boys in the 7 Kingdoms, so she was forced to create a new excuse to defend her invasion of Westeros.</p><p>So, she told the audience that she wants to break the wheel of power that crushes the poor and the weak on Westeros. It makes no sense of course. She wants to break the wheel, by building a new wheel, this time, with only her family on top, crushing those under her. This is a phony ridiculous excuse and its supposed to be ridiculous. It\u2019s a silly lie, all Daenerys wants in the Iron Throne, but she cant admit it afraid it will make her look bad, so she created this silly little lie and the audience (just like Sansa fell into Cersei silly lies in season 1) fell right into. What Dany really wants is install an absolute monarchy, with only HER in power.</p><p>Daenerys is a false prophet, who invented a sacred mission to convince her people and those who follow her of her good intentions, yet all her actions are motivated from the desire to take The Iron Throne, that\u2019s the one thing who truly matters for Daenerys and now in season 8, when her claim to the Throne will be contested by the bombastic news of Jon Snow stronger claim to the Throne. That\u2019s whe she will finally show to the audience who she really is.</p><p><br></p><h2>WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE BLINDLY FOLLOW, GOD AND HEROS;</h2><p><br></p><p>By writing Daenerys Targaryen, George RRMartin wanted to show us how dictators and cult leaders are created. They started magical and inspiring, making beautiful speeches and promising great things, but in end, most of them are motivated by selfish desires and allow power to corrupt them. Daenerys story is also a warning about following leaders without questioning their motivations or decisions. Daenerys is adored as a goddess by her followers and never has her decision questioned by them. Unlike Jon Snow who is always questioned by Sansa, The North Lords and the Wildlings about his decisions. The Dothraki and the Unsullied just blindly follow Daenerys around, like children following their mothers, never questioning her real motives, or even contemplating if the move to Westeros has actually any benefits for them. And as we are about to see in season 8, following leaders blindly can be a very dangerous thing because it can lead us to our graves. The audience, the Dothraki and the Unsullied never thought that their hero could just simply be lying to them\u2026\u2026No matter how much destruction and death she causes, her followers and advisers keep believing in her, defending her decisions, turning a blind eye to her questionable actions, finding excuses to her terrible acts. They know that she can be impulsive and dangerous but believe that in the end she is motivated by great ideals and will always listen to her advisers\u2026\u2026..</p><p>Daenerys first instinct is always destruction and violence, but most of the time, she is restrained by her advisers\u2026\u2026\u2026. But the rope that holds her together is about to be ripped apart in season 8.</p><p><br></p><blockquote><p>Daario Naharis: <b>\u201cI pity the Lords of Westeros, they have no idea what is coming for them\u201d</b></p><p>(SEASON 6 EPISODE 10)</p><p><br></p></blockquote><p>Daenerys was always meant to be the final antagonist of the story, her time in Essos was not about learning to be a good queen, she was learning to be a ruthless conqueror, which she learned very well. Don\u2019t be surprised if she marries Euron Greyjoy, they marriage has been foreshadowed on books and tv show. Daenerys its gonna shock the audience, she is going to behave in a way that will surprise a lot of people.<br></p><p>Jon and Daenerys relationship will mirror Rhaenyra and Aegon tragic battle for the Throne; This will be the final battle on episode 5, the fight for the Throne has always been the main focus of the story and this battle its what is going to put an end to this tale. Westeros will finally be united against the common enemy, which is Daenerys and her dragons.</p><p>The Army of the Dead and the Night King were always a red herring, its was always Daenerys and her dragons the major threat for Westeros. I believe that more than half of the population of Westeros will perish during the final wars; many who survive the war will latter die during the winter without the food that was destroyed by Daenerys dragons in the Field of Fire 2.0; in her short period in Westeros, Daenerys will cause a lot of deaths and destruction and she will be remembered as the Queen of Ashes.</p><p>The stallion that mounts the world was never Rhaego. It was always going to be Daenerys. Essos will also be throw into chaos, without Daenerys dragons to impose order, the masters of Astapor, Meereen and the local cities will raise again and the region will probably be engulfed into a civil war. It will probably take centuries for the world to recover from Daenerys reign of terror.</p><p><br></p><h2>WINTER WILL COME TO HOUSE TARGARYEN;</h2><p><b><br></b></p><p>Daenerys final battle on episode 5, will turn Kings Landing into ashes, but she wont be destroying just the capital of the realm, she will also put an end to House Targaryen. Their dynasty started with the destruction of Harrenhall and will end with the destruction of the capital that The Targaryens themselves build, closing a cycle of tyranny, fear and terror. Daenerys will be the last dragon.</p><h2>DRAGONSTONE WILL FAIL;</h2><p><br></p><figure data-orig-width=\"2000\" data-orig-height=\"1120\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/31e728bb18f6e03ee2f8869ca038918f/tumblr_inline_pm5u98wcWp1sgp768_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"2000\" data-orig-height=\"1120\"></figure><h2><br></h2><p>I believe that Dragonstone will be destroyed in the end. The Castle in the remote island serves no purpose for Westeros. It can not be used for grains production or animal livestock, the only use for Dragonstone in the past centuries was to be used as base for a foreign invasion, the castle will probably be destroyed in the end. Also important, Daenerys spent this entire story threatening to destroy other\u2019s peoples houses and cities. To have her own ancestral House destroyed in the end would be very fitting to the story.<br></p><p><br></p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cso comes snow, after fire and even dragons have their ending\u201d\u00a0</i></p><p>J.

Robert\u2019s Rebelion will happen again. Sansa will be kidnapped at some point, just like aunt Lyanna Stark; Arya will lead the North armies south to save her sister (just like Ned Stark did in Robert\u2019s Rebellion). The Riverlands, the North and the Vale will once again gather forces and go to war.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><blockquote><p>Stannis: \u201cWhat are you reading?\u201d</p><p>Shireen: <b>\u201cThe Dance of Dragons.\u201d</b></p><p>Stannis: \u201cWhat\u2019s it about? It\u2019s the story of the fight between Rhaenyra Targaryen and her half-brother Aegon for control over the Seven Kingdoms. Both of them thought they belonged on the Iron Throne. When people started declaring for one of them or the other, their fight divided the kingdoms in two. <b>Brothers fought brothers, dragons fought dragons. By the time it was over, thousands were dead. And it was a disaster for the Targaryens as well. They never truly recovered.</b></p><p>(GAME OF THRONES SEASON 5 EPISODE 9)</p><p><br></p><p><br></p></blockquote><p>We will have a second Dance of Dragons, with the kingdom divided between Jon Snow and Daenerys Targaryen. The Lannisters will be divided too by this war. Tyrion (the flop) will choose Daenerys side and Jaime will choose Jon Snow and the Starks. This will be the decision that will change Jaime Lannister legacy forever.</p><p>Millions will die, but in the end Jon Snow and his armies will defeat Daenerys and her dragons. This war will not only destroy the realm but finally bring an end to the Targaryen dynasty. This battle will probably happens on episode 5.</p><p><br></p><h2>SANSA\u2019S PLANS TO CAST DOWN CERSEI\u2026</h2><p><br></p><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"287\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/606011674977c01975eb40f294e3fd29/tumblr_inline_pm5uanuNnL1sgp768_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"287\"></figure><h2><br></h2><h2><br></h2><p>Sansa will be kidnapped in season 8, probably by Cersei, but don\u2019t be surprised if this kidnapping has a twist. In season 1, in the scene where Cersei and the small council is forcing Sansa to write down a letter to Rob Stark demanding him to bend the knee to King Joffrey., we have Maester Pycelle warning Cersei that Sansa may be so sweet and innocent now, but once she is older, she may hatch some treasons!!!!</p><blockquote><p>\u201cshe (Sansa) may be a sweet thing now Your Grace, but in 10 YEARS, who knows what treasons she may hatch!!!!\u201d</p><p>(SEASON 1 EPISODE 8)</p><p><br></p></blockquote><p>Now, we know that Sansa did learn a lot from Cersei and maybe now she is finally ready to outsmart her former teacher\u2026 This was the first foreshadowing of Sansa\u2019s plans to cast down Cersei.</p><p>And in season 6, we have another foreshadowing of how Sansa will plot against Cersei in the end, When Arya is in Braavos, she watches a Bravossi Theather play telling the events that happened in Westeros. In that storyline, the actress that plays Sansa hires a faceless man to kill the actress who plays Cersei, Lady Crane. I believe this was another foreshadowing of the events that will happen in season 8. Its Sansa who is taking Cersei down. The little dove will prove to the queen that she learned all her lessons. But I believe Jon Snow will be the one killing Cersei.</p><p><br></p><h2>EPISODE 5 WILL BE THE DANCE OF DRAGONS;</h2><p><br></p><blockquote><p>He was no dragon, Dany thought, curiously calm. Fire cannot kill a dragon.</p><p>(A Game of Thrones - Daenerys V)</p><p><br></p></blockquote><p><br></p><p>Well I believe thats exactly whats its gonna happen. In order to defeat Daenerys you have to kill her last dragon, Drogon, which we know will be flying over Kings Landing in the end of this story. Thats how the wildfire comes in. I actually think Jon and the Lannisters may set a trap for Dany and use the wildfire to kill the dragon and Daenery\u2019s remain armies. Maybe Bran was behind King Aerys decision to cover KL with wildfire, already preparing to use against Daenerys in the finall battle for the Throne. if we rewatch season 5 episode 7 we had a little hint about this idea.</p><p><br></p><blockquote><p>DAARIO: On the day of the Great Games, gather all the great masters, and wise masters, and worthy masters you can find, and slaughter them all.</p><p>DAENERYS: I am a queen. Not a butcher.</p><p>DAARIO: All rulers are either butchers or meat.</p><p><br></p></blockquote><p><br></p><p>Remember that Bran\u2019s first chapter he is forced to watch his father doing the Kings\u2019s justice and Ned explains to him that \u201cthe man who passes the sentence, must swing the sword\u201d. This is one of the most important themes in the story.</p><p>Also, in season 4 episode 2, we have Bran having a vision of the events that will happen for the first time. This is THE vision where he sees the dragon flying over KL. After the vision he tells Jojen and Meera: \u201cI know where we have to go\u201d. The show then cuts to a scene in Kings Landing.</p><p>So, I do believe Bran will be involved with the explosion of Kings Landing and using the wildfire as a last weapon to defeat Daenerys and her last dragon. Thats the only way Westeros will ever be free of the Targaryens.</p><p>BTW, gathering all your enemies in a closed space and destroying them with fire has been used by both mad queens, Cersei and Daenerys, so maybe now we will see the Starks using this idea to finally get rid of Daenerys, her armies and her dragon.</p><p><br></p><h2>THE FUTURE OF HOUSE LANNISTER</h2><p>No, House Lannister will not fall into nothing like the Targaryens. The House will be saved by Jaime Lannister, who will marry Brienne of Tarth and restore his family and legacy.</p><p><br></p><h2>JAIME LANNISTER ITS GOING TO BE THE FINAL HAND AND ITS GOING TO END THIS STORY AS A GREAT HERO;</h2><p><br></p><figure data-orig-width=\"980\" data-orig-height=\"490\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/73b5389c30d8ef91064c03b6c0a5f945/tumblr_inline_pm5ueyWqgV1sgp768_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"980\" data-orig-height=\"490\"></figure><p>Jaime Lannister will choose Jon Snow, this will be the turning point for Jaime and the choice that will change his legacy. There is some very good foreshadowing in the books that hint to us that Jaime will side with Jon Snow in the final battle and help him to defeat Daenerys and her dragons.<br></p><p>I believe it will be Jaime who will kill Daenerys last dragon, Drogon, and becoming famous as a DRAGONSLAYER; Jaime Lannister will have a big role in the final part of this story, not only helping defeat the ARMY OF THE DEAD, but also defeating Daenerys Targaryen and saving the Kingdom once again from a tyrannical Targaryen; only this time he will finally receive the thank you, from the people of Westeros;</p><p>Jaime will be greeted as a hero and will end this story beloved and admired by the people. I believe at some point in season 8 Jaime will die and will be brought back to life, his character was written as a mirror to Jon Snow and Jon died on season 5, so this storyline may be possible.</p><p>Jaime will be the Hand of the King for Jon Snow (there is a lot of foreshadowing for this, in both books and tv show) and he will be able to finish his history in the white book as a hero. He will go down in history as one of the greatest Hands in the history of the 7 kingdoms. Jaime will be the last Lannister left on Westeros.</p><p><br></p><h2>TYRION WILL BE SENT INTO EXILE;</h2><p><br></p><p>Tyrion will have to face a trial for a third time and this time he will be guilty of his crimes. Yeah, that is not a prediction, it\u2019s a spoiler, but I already expected that. George loves his 3. Tyrion its one of the characters that will have a very tragic ending. He was the fool who brought Daenerys to Westeros believing he could control her, the same mistake his sister Cersei tried to do with Joffrey. He invited Jon Snow under false premises to Dragonstone without mentioning to Jon about Daenerys demands to bend the knee.</p><p>He made a deal with Cersei that was never disclosed to the audience and I believe he may be behind Sansa\u2019s kidnapping story in season 8. He keeps making one mistake after the other, always believing to be smarter than the people around him, always under estimating the players of the game.</p><p>But I don\u2019t believe he will die. In the House videos released for season 8, they had the Lannisters brothers, Jaime and Tyrion, saying goodbye to each other and I believe we will see them say good bye one last time. I think Tyrion will be sent into exile to Essos, and banned from returning to Westeros.</p><p><br></p><h2>CERSEI WILL DIE;</h2><p>There has been a lot of foreshadowing about Cersei death and its one of the events many believe it happen for sure. The show made sure to write us a scene when her ending is predicted.</p><p><br></p><blockquote><p>\u201cI will hurt you for this. A day will come when you think you\u2019re safe and happy and your joy will turn to ashes in your mouth. And you will know the debt is paid.\u201d</p><p>(Tyrion - SEASON 2 EPISODE 8)</p><p><br></p></blockquote><p><br></p><p>This episode was written by George RRMartin himself, so, I always assumed this was Cersei Lannister ending\u2026 Then in season 7, we had Jon Snow threatening to kill Littlefinger is he ever touched Sansa. In that scene we have Jon Snow choking Baelish with his cold hands and I believe this scene could be a foreshadow of Jon finally killing Cersei, for trying to hurt Sansa in season 8. The prophecy says that Cersei will be killed by the \u201clittle brother\u201d and Jon Snow fits that role as the younger son of Rheagar Targaryen.</p><p>_______________________________________________________________</p><p><br></p><h2>THEON WILL BE KING OF THE IRON ISLANDS;</h2><p>He lifted his head to look at her. \u201cCatelyn,\u201d he said. His voice was distant and formal. \u201cWhere are the children?\u201d</p><p>A Game of Thrones - Catelyn I</p><p>I believe the children of Wintefell were always meant to be the heroes of this story. That\u2019s why George made sure to have a Greyjoy, a Targaryen be raised close to the Stark children. Those children now are gonna be the rulers of Westeros and they will be the ones passing Ned Stark legacy forward, building a new and better world.</p><p>Thast why I believe Theon will kill Euron Greyjoy and be the king of the Iron Islands; Theon probably has a bastard child with the captain\u2019s daughter he met in season 2 on his journey to Pike, he will recognize the child and raise them as his heir;</p><h2>A TIME FOR WOLVES;</h2><p><b><br></b></p><figure data-orig-width=\"599\" data-orig-height=\"287\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e6eaee32c64120ed47c03b3bc7061f9d/tumblr_inline_pm5uvnO0W51sgp768_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"599\" data-orig-height=\"287\"></figure><p><br></p><p>It will be a Time for Wolves; a new period for Westeros. Jon will rule surrounded by Starks, carrying the Stark name with Sansa and Bran by his side; The capital will probably be transferred to HighGarden, not only the castle it is still intact but its also located in the most fertile area of Westeros. It seems like a very interesting political decision. Again, I found a lot of foreshadowing for this in the books.</p><p>Jon Snow will rule over a graveyard, as he predicted in season 7. But the ending will be very sweet, with kids playing around in gardens and celebrating. We will see Jon, the Stark kids, Jaime and Brienne, Sam and Guilly, Theon\u2026.. ect all enjoying spring and celebrating their happy ending.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><h2>THE VERY LAST SCENE OF THE STORY\u2026..</h2><p><br></p><p>Daniel Abraham is the man responsible for converting the Game of Thrones book into a comic, mentioned that there is a particular line of dialog in the game of thrones book, which is very important for the last scene of \u201cA Dream of Spring\u201d.</p><p>Have you collaborated at all with George R.R. Martin in the process of adapting the novel to comics? If so, what\u2019s the creative process there?</p><p>Daniel: \u201cI\u2019ve spoken to George a lot in the process. The biggest issues we have are continuity questions. There are things about this story that only he knows, and they aren\u2019t all obvious. There was one scene I had to rework because there\u2019s a particular line of dialog \u2013 and you wouldn\u2019t know it to look at \u2013 that\u2019s important in the last scene of \u201cA Dream of Spring.\u201d- Daniel Abraham</p><p>On episode 1, when King Robert goes to visit Winterfell, he and Ned go down in the crypts to pay their respects to Lyanna Stark, the wolf girl he lost to Rheagar Targeryen. In that scene, the dialogue is different from what we have in the books.</p><p><br></p><blockquote><p>ROBERT: Did you have to bury her in a place like this? She should be on a hill somewhere with the sun and the clouds above her.</p><p>NED: She was my sister. This is where she belongs.</p><p><br></p></blockquote><p>In the books, this conversation is different:</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><blockquote><p>\"Ah, damn it, Ned, did you have to bury her in a place like this?\u201d His voice was hoarse with remembered grief. \u201cShe deserved more than darkness \u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was a Stark of Winterfell,\u201d Ned said quietly. \u201cThis is her place.\u201d</p><p>A Game of Thrones - Eddard I</p><p><br></p></blockquote><p>I think this is the scene. I believe we will end this story with King Jon visiting his late wife Sansa Stark in the crypts of Winterfell and someone will ask him why did he buried her there, why not building a monument for her, so that she could be on display and that\u2019s how he will reply:<br></p><p><br></p><blockquote><p>She was a Stark of Winterfell, this is where she belongs\u2026.</p><p><br></p></blockquote><p>What made me believe this, were two momments of the story: First of all, Lady\u2019s death. After Sansa direwolf is killed on her way to the south, Ned Stark makes sure to send a group of men back to the North and Winterfell, so that she can be buried in Northerner soil. Lady represented a little bit of Sansa, who died on that day and I dont think it was a silly detail George rrmartin make sure that her direwolf body was buried on Winterfell, I think that this scene, was much more important than most people think about it.</p><p><br></p><blockquote><p>When it was over, he said, \u201cChoose four men and have them take the body north. <b>Bury her at Winterfell</b>.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll that way?\u201d Jory said, astonished.\u201cAll that way,\u201d Ned affirmed. \u201cThe Lannister woman shall never have this skin.\u201d</p><p>A Game of Thrones - Eddard III</p><p><br></p></blockquote><p>Another momment in the story was Ygritte death. In both books and show, Jon Snow takes her body and goes to bury her up North, where she belonged.</p><p><br></p><blockquote><p>Tormund: Did you love her? She loved you.</p><p>Jon: She told you?</p><p>Tormund: No. All she ever talked about was killing you. That\u2019s how I know. <b>She belongs in the North. The real North.</b> You understand me?</p><p><br></p></blockquote><p><br></p><p>Look at the excuse Tormund gives Jon to why Ygritte needs to be buried North of the Wall, its the same Ned Stark used to explain to King Robert why Lyanna had to be buried in the Crypts of Winterfell. Because thats where she belongs\u2026\u2026.</p><p>I also believe this ending could bring the story to a full circle, because there is also the theme of the audience never really thinking as Sansa as a TRUE STARK. There is still the notion that Sansa is not really a Stark like Jon or Arya.</p><p>Sansa Starkiness was always a topic of contention among fans of the books and series. Many like to refer to Sansa as Lady Lannister or Lady Bolton, so to have Sansa finally resting in the Winterfell crypts, by the end of this story, as a Stark, would be a very satisfying ending. Her hair maybe red and some of her manners may be more southern like, but Sansa IS A STARK.</p><p>And in fact, she is the Stark who took back the North and Winterfell, she is the Stark who made possible for the family to reunite and be safe; she is the Stark who stood by Jon side when he was made King in the North and supported his claim; she was the Stark who prepared the North for the wars and the winter and she will be the Stark who will rule the 7 Kingdoms together with her husband.</p><p>Both Jon and Sansa are foreshadowed to live very long lives and I expect their ruling period to last decades. They will be the ones restoring and rebuilding the kingdom after the wars of Ice and Fire. But I do believe Jon will live longer based on a quote from the books.</p><p><br></p><blockquote><p>Tyrion shared around his skin of wine until even Yoren grew mellow. <b>One by one the company drifted off to their shelters and to sleep, all but Jon Snow, who had drawn the night\u2019s first watch.</b> Tyrion was the last to retire, as always. As he stepped into the shelter his men had built for him, he paused and looked back at Jon Snow. The boy stood near the fire, his face still and hard, looking deep into the flames. Tyrion Lannister smiled sadly and went to bed. -<br>AGOT Tyrion II</p></blockquote><p><br></p><p>And because of this line, I believe Jon Snow ill be the last one to die, he will live a very long life and will be forced to see all the ones he loved pass away, one by one.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><h2>THE END OF GAME OF THRONES\u2026</h2></p>",

Their romance has been foreshadow pretty much since book 1 and season 1 and their marriage will bring peace and prosperity to Westeros. The wars of Ice and Fire will destroy the kingdom and they will be the ones rebuilding the realm to its former glory; Jon and Sansa storyline are in a perfect parallel and they have been groomed to be king and queen of Westeros for the whole storyline in the books.</p><h2>JON SNOW HAS ALWAYS LOVED SANSA STARK;</h2><p><br /></p><p>Jon Snow has always been in love with his cousin Sansa Stark, which is why he decided to go to the wall after Ned Stark accepted Sansa&rsquo;s engagement to Joffrey Baratheon. Jon was written as a mirror to Jaime Lannister and one of the reasons Jaime decided to join the kingsguard was because he could never marry his sister and lover Cersei. Once the secret of Lyanna and Rheagar is finally out, Jon and Sansa will be free to be together. Their love story is the main romance of the books.</p><p>BTW, don&rsquo;t be surprised if they reveal the romance between Jon and Sansa in the end of the first episode of season 8. The episode will start mirroring the pilot episode, when King Robert arrived at Winterfell with his Lannister family and we all know the episode ended with the reveal of Cersei and Jaime incestual romance.</p><p><br /></p><h2>JON SNOW IS GOING TO BE A STARK;</h2><p>Jon Snow is going to take Sansa Stark name and pass the Stark name to all his children. He will be finally be a Stark and die as a true son by law of Eddard Stark, just like he always dreamed of in the books. This was foreshadowed in season 6 episode 5, when Sansa cloaked Jon Snow with a Stark Cloak.</p><p><br /></p><h2>JON WILL FATHER A BASTARD</h2><p>Jon Snow will father a bastard. He will have trueborn sons with his wife Sansa Stark, but he will have a bastard girl with Daenerys. The books have foreshadowed this event to death. Jon and Sansa will pass this bastard girl as their own trueborn child and give her their Stark name. Sansa will raise this child as her own daughter and make her a Stark. That&rsquo;s why the show wrote that scene with Catelyn Stark and Talissa on season 3 where Catelyn says that she failed to love and care for her husband bastard child, Sansa will do the opposite and love and care for Jon&rsquo;s bastard daughter.</p><p>Jon will do the inverse of his uncle Ned, who lied and raised his trueborn nephew as a bastard. The story of Game of Thrones started with Ned Stark starting a war to prevent a bastard son of Cersei Lannister to sit in the Throne and it will end with a bastard daughter of Jon Snow as the heir of the Throne. History repeat itself and in the end, there wont be much difference between Starks and Lannister, they all lie to protect the ones they love.</p><p>&ldquo;The things we do for love&rdquo; will still be the theme of the story in the end&hellip;.</p><p><br /></p><h2>THIS IS A STORY OF FATHER&rsquo;S DAUGHTERS&hellip;.</h2><p><br /></p><p>A SONG OF ICE AND FIRE its many tales in one; this is a tale of a Dragon prince madly in love with a Wolf girl; this is also a tale about home and families; about the things we do for love; it&rsquo;s a story about tyranny and fear; its also a story about slow learners, who make several mistakes, but that eventually do learn, but ALSO, A SONG OF ICE AND FIRE, is a story about father&rsquo;s daughters.</p><p>And that&rsquo;s exactly what Arya, Sansa, Cersei, Daenerys, Brienne all are. These women are their father&rsquo;s daughters. That&rsquo;s why the show gave so much importance on those character&rsquo;s fathers and hardly touched the mothers relevance.</p><p>No one thought Sansa and Daenerys had much of their fathers in themselves, those two characters were always associated with their mothers, yet they will prove to all of us that they carry much of Eddar and Aerys inside of them, in the last part of this story.</p><p><br /></p><h2>THE STARK SISTERS WILL GET EVERYTHING THEY EVER WANTED&hellip;</h2><blockquote><p><br /></p></blockquote><p><br /></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/2f7beda43cf2d3363b1942b24764016c/tumblr_inline_pm5u2jBCaP1sgp768_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><blockquote><p>Arya: &ldquo;We both wanted to be the other people when we were younger. You wanted to be a queen and sit next to a handsome, young king on the Iron Throne. I wanted to be a knight, to pick up a sword like father and go off to battle. Neither of us got to be that other person, did we? The world doesnt just let girls decide what they are going to be.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p><p>(SEASON 7 EPISODE 6)</p><p><br /></p></blockquote><h2>AND THEY ARE GOING TO BE QUEENS&hellip;.</h2><p>Yes, we will have two queens. Game of Thrones started with two queens. Daenerys and Cersei; one a conqueror, the second a consort queen. Two women, whose obsession for the Iron Throne, left a trail of death and destruction on Essos and Westeros. So, we will finish this story with two queens, who will restore the Kingdom and improve the lives of their people. Sansa will be the consort queen of Jon Snow and Arya will be the warrior, the conquering queen that will lead the armies of North, Vale and Riverlands into war in season 8.</p><p><br /></p><h2>SANSA STARK WILL BE &ldquo;THE QUEEN&rdquo;;</h2><p><br /></p><p>Queen Sansa Stark will change the Law of Succession allowing girls to be heirs in front of their younger brothers. Sansa it&rsquo;s the YMBQ of the prophecy and she will be the one casting Cersei Lannister down; Sansa will be very political active queen, changing laws and improving the lives of the people of Westeros and making important changes in the realm; She will be loved by her people and called THE QUEEN.</p><p>Sansa was always meant to be the final queen and the one who will rebuild the kingdom after the wars. Sansa entire storyline in the books was about observing the major players of the game make their moves and see the ramifications of those decisions. In Kings Landing, Sansa saw it first hand how ruling can affect the lives of the people in Westeros. She was able to see what to do, when in power, but also, what NOT to do as a king or queen. She learned a lot from Cersei, Margaery, Ollena, the Tyrells, The Lannisters, Littlefinger and will use this education for good use as a queen.</p><p>All Sansa&rsquo;s dreams will come true and she will be a living proof that &ldquo;life is a song&rdquo;. She will marry her brave and gentle hero; she will have children and rebuild her family and she will be a very beloved queen, admired for her beauty and kindness.</p><p><br /></p><h2>ARYA WILL BE THE QUEEN IN THE NORTH;</h2><p><br /></p><p>Arys Stark will rule the North as a Regent Queen. Arya storyline in season 8 will be a copy of Papa Ned in the first Rebellion against the Mad King. She will call the banners and lead the North armies into battle in the final war of this story. George RRMartin himself said that she would conquer the world in the final part of this tale.</p><p><br /></p><h2>ARYA WILL BE VERY IMPORTANT IN THE FINAL SEASON !!!!!</h2><p><br /></p><p>Arya is season 8 will be a huge warrior, with the help of Nymeria and their pack of wolves, she is going to lead their armies into battle, defeating Daenerys armies in combat (yes, the Dothraki bitches!!!!!!) They will probably meet in the Riverlands, where Rheagar and Robert had their first and final confrontation. She will be the one who will kill the mountain, avenging the people that he cruelly killed in the Riverlands and the Hound. Just like papa Ned became famous for killing Ser Arthur Dane, Arya will be legendary for killing the Mountain. They will write songs about her for years and years to come&hellip;&hellip;</p><p><br /></p><h2>BRAN STARK WILL BE THE MAGICAL FORCE TO STOP THE ARMY OF THE DEAD&hellip;</h2><h2><br /></h2><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/cb5a9eeba9a21e09fa027a4d5e29bee9/tumblr_inline_pm5u5aiMqM1sgp768_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><h2><br /></h2><p>I know the audience expects Daenerys and her dragons to be the magical force used to stop the Army of the Dead, but, don&rsquo;t be shocked if she decides to abandon the cause in the middle of the fight and leave the North before the big battle against the Night King. There is a lot of Stannis in Daenerys character arc on season 7 and in the end, Stannis left Jon and the Nights Watch on their own to fight the Night King on Hardhome, and went to march to Winterfell to fight the Boltons. Stannis could never let it go completely of the Iron Throne and I expect Dany to do the same.</p><p>Its Bran Stark, who has been preparing himself to face this threat since the beginning of this story. Its Bran Stark who has been foreshadowed by the books and tv show to be the one who will matter the most in the end. Not the dragons. I suspect we will see the ghosts of the Kings of Winter, coming out from the crypts of Winterfell, to fight the final battle against the Army of the Dead.</p><p>Bran: What else have you seen it? Jojen: The ONLY think that matters. YOU.</p><p>(Season 3 Episode 2)</p><p>Also, in the first Long Night, there was no Targaryens; The North was left to fight on its own with the help of the Children of the Forest and George likes to repeat his stories very closely to the original. Defeating the Army of the Dead wont be Bran only job in season 8, he has also been written as a foil to Daenerys, so I believe he will be involved on her final defeat.</p><p><br /></p><h2>DAENERYS WILL BE THE FINAL ANTAGONIST IN SEASON 8 AND WE WILL HAVE A SECOND DANCE OF DRAGONS BETWEEN JON AND DANY&hellip;&hellip;</h2><p><br /></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/21fdccfff8b756b781f5c03f45e95a7e/tumblr_inline_pm5u5w9MAV1sgp768_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><h2><br /></h2><blockquote><p>Jon Snow: <b>&ldquo;They will see it you for &ldquo;what you are&rdquo;.</b></p><p><b>(</b>SEASON 7 EPISODE 6)</p><p><br /></p></blockquote><p>In the beginning of this story we saw Sansa Stark falling madly in love with a beautiful prince, only to have her heart broken in a million of pieces in the end of season 1, when Joffrey shocked her by cutting her father&rsquo;s head, finally showing how cruel and monstrous he really was. In the beginning of the series, we also had the audience falling madly in love with the beautiful Daenerys Targaryen, believing she was the hero of this story and just like Sansa, the audience will be shocked by Daenerys actions in season 8 and they will have their hearts completely broken in a million of pieces. Daenerys will finally show to the audience the monster that she really is. I expect to see a lot of shades of Joffrey on Daenerys in season 8. Remember, Joffrey believed his whole life he was the true heir of the Iron Throne, until a Stark man showed up in his life, telling him that this was a lie. This is exactely what is going to happen to Daenerys in season 8.</p><p>Remember when Sansa Stark fell madly in love with a monster and trusted a beautiful queen blindly when she was warned against it? You are all Sansas, you just don&rsquo;t know yet.</p><p>Daenerys could never be the villain of her own story. That&rsquo;s why it was always necessary for her to create a lie that painted her as the hero. She invaded Astapor to save the Unsulied from the evil wise masters; she conquered Meereen to pay back the slavers for crucifying the children slaves; she destroyed the sacred temple of Vaes Dothrak and killed all the Khalls, but she did for the Dothraki widows who didnt wish to stay in the Dosh khaleen. Now in Westeros she had no more excuses, there is no slavery or evil masters torturing young boys in the 7 Kingdoms, so she was forced to create a new excuse to defend her invasion of Westeros.</p><p>So, she told the audience that she wants to break the wheel of power that crushes the poor and the weak on Westeros. It makes no sense of course. She wants to break the wheel, by building a new wheel, this time, with only her family on top, crushing those under her. This is a phony ridiculous excuse and its supposed to be ridiculous. It&rsquo;s a silly lie, all Daenerys wants in the Iron Throne, but she cant admit it afraid it will make her look bad, so she created this silly little lie and the audience (just like Sansa fell into Cersei silly lies in season 1) fell right into. What Dany really wants is install an absolute monarchy, with only HER in power.</p><p>Daenerys is a false prophet, who invented a sacred mission to convince her people and those who follow her of her good intentions, yet all her actions are motivated from the desire to take The Iron Throne, that&rsquo;s the one thing who truly matters for Daenerys and now in season 8, when her claim to the Throne will be contested by the bombastic news of Jon Snow stronger claim to the Throne. That&rsquo;s whe she will finally show to the audience who she really is.</p><p><br /></p><h2>WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE BLINDLY FOLLOW, GOD AND HEROS;</h2><p><br /></p><p>By writing Daenerys Targaryen, George RRMartin wanted to show us how dictators and cult leaders are created. They started magical and inspiring, making beautiful speeches and promising great things, but in end, most of them are motivated by selfish desires and allow power to corrupt them. Daenerys story is also a warning about following leaders without questioning their motivations or decisions. Daenerys is adored as a goddess by her followers and never has her decision questioned by them. Unlike Jon Snow who is always questioned by Sansa, The North Lords and the Wildlings about his decisions. The Dothraki and the Unsullied just blindly follow Daenerys around, like children following their mothers, never questioning her real motives, or even contemplating if the move to Westeros has actually any benefits for them. And as we are about to see in season 8, following leaders blindly can be a very dangerous thing because it can lead us to our graves. The audience, the Dothraki and the Unsullied never thought that their hero could just simply be lying to them&hellip;&hellip;No matter how much destruction and death she causes, her followers and advisers keep believing in her, defending her decisions, turning a blind eye to her questionable actions, finding excuses to her terrible acts. They know that she can be impulsive and dangerous but believe that in the end she is motivated by great ideals and will always listen to her advisers&hellip;&hellip;..</p><p>Daenerys first instinct is always destruction and violence, but most of the time, she is restrained by her advisers&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;. But the rope that holds her together is about to be ripped apart in season 8.</p><p><br /></p><blockquote><p>Daario Naharis: <b>&ldquo;I pity the Lords of Westeros, they have no idea what is coming for them&rdquo;</b></p><p>(SEASON 6 EPISODE 10)</p><p><br /></p></blockquote><p>Daenerys was always meant to be the final antagonist of the story, her time in Essos was not about learning to be a good queen, she was learning to be a ruthless conqueror, which she learned very well. Don&rsquo;t be surprised if she marries Euron Greyjoy, they marriage has been foreshadowed on books and tv show. Daenerys its gonna shock the audience, she is going to behave in a way that will surprise a lot of people.<br /></p><p>Jon and Daenerys relationship will mirror Rhaenyra and Aegon tragic battle for the Throne; This will be the final battle on episode 5, the fight for the Throne has always been the main focus of the story and this battle its what is going to put an end to this tale. Westeros will finally be united against the common enemy, which is Daenerys and her dragons.</p><p>The Army of the Dead and the Night King were always a red herring, its was always Daenerys and her dragons the major threat for Westeros. I believe that more than half of the population of Westeros will perish during the final wars; many who survive the war will latter die during the winter without the food that was destroyed by Daenerys dragons in the Field of Fire 2.0; in her short period in Westeros, Daenerys will cause a lot of deaths and destruction and she will be remembered as the Queen of Ashes.</p><p>The stallion that mounts the world was never Rhaego. It was always going to be Daenerys. Essos will also be throw into chaos, without Daenerys dragons to impose order, the masters of Astapor, Meereen and the local cities will raise again and the region will probably be engulfed into a civil war. It will probably take centuries for the world to recover from Daenerys reign of terror.</p><p><br /></p><h2>WINTER WILL COME TO HOUSE TARGARYEN;</h2><p><b><br /></b></p><p>Daenerys final battle on episode 5, will turn Kings Landing into ashes, but she wont be destroying just the capital of the realm, she will also put an end to House Targaryen. Their dynasty started with the destruction of Harrenhall and will end with the destruction of the capital that The Targaryens themselves build, closing a cycle of tyranny, fear and terror. Daenerys will be the last dragon.</p><h2>DRAGONSTONE WILL FAIL;</h2><p><br /></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/31e728bb18f6e03ee2f8869ca038918f/tumblr_inline_pm5u98wcWp1sgp768_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><h2><br /></h2><p>I believe that Dragonstone will be destroyed in the end. The Castle in the remote island serves no purpose for Westeros. It can not be used for grains production or animal livestock, the only use for Dragonstone in the past centuries was to be used as base for a foreign invasion, the castle will probably be destroyed in the end. Also important, Daenerys spent this entire story threatening to destroy other&rsquo;s peoples houses and cities. To have her own ancestral House destroyed in the end would be very fitting to the story.<br /></p><p><br /></p><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;so comes snow, after fire and even dragons have their ending&rdquo;&nbsp;</i></p><p>J. R.R TOKIEN</p></blockquote><p><br /></p><h2>WE WILL HAVE A SECOND REBELLION AND A SECOND DANCE OF THE DRAGONS&hellip;</h2><p><br /></p><blockquote><p>Don&rsquo;t fight in the North. Or the South. Fight every battle, everywhere, always, in your mind. Everyone is your enemy, everyone is your friend&hellip; every possible series of events is happening all at once. Live that way and nothing will surprise you, &hellip;&hellip;..everything that happens will be something that you have seen before.</p><p>(Litllefinger SEASON 7 EPISODE 2)</p><p><br /></p></blockquote><p><br /></p><p>Everything that happened in the past will happen again in season 8. Robert&rsquo;s Rebelion will happen again. Sansa will be kidnapped at some point, just like aunt Lyanna Stark; Arya will lead the North armies south to save her sister (just like Ned Stark did in Robert&rsquo;s Rebellion). The Riverlands, the North and the Vale will once again gather forces and go to war.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><blockquote><p>Stannis: &ldquo;What are you reading?&rdquo;</p><p>Shireen: <b>&ldquo;The Dance of Dragons.&rdquo;</b></p><p>Stannis: &ldquo;What&rsquo;s it about? It&rsquo;s the story of the fight between Rhaenyra Targaryen and her half-brother Aegon for control over the Seven Kingdoms. Both of them thought they belonged on the Iron Throne. When people started declaring for one of them or the other, their fight divided the kingdoms in two. <b>Brothers fought brothers, dragons fought dragons. By the time it was over, thousands were dead. And it was a disaster for the Targaryens as well. They never truly recovered.</b></p><p>(GAME OF THRONES SEASON 5 EPISODE 9)</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p></blockquote><p>We will have a second Dance of Dragons, with the kingdom divided between Jon Snow and Daenerys Targaryen. The Lannisters will be divided too by this war. Tyrion (the flop) will choose Daenerys side and Jaime will choose Jon Snow and the Starks. This will be the decision that will change Jaime Lannister legacy forever.</p><p>Millions will die, but in the end Jon Snow and his armies will defeat Daenerys and her dragons. This war will not only destroy the realm but finally bring an end to the Targaryen dynasty. This battle will probably happens on episode 5.</p><p><br /></p><h2>SANSA&rsquo;S PLANS TO CAST DOWN CERSEI&hellip;</h2><p><br /></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/606011674977c01975eb40f294e3fd29/tumblr_inline_pm5uanuNnL1sgp768_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><h2><br /></h2><h2><br /></h2><p>Sansa will be kidnapped in season 8, probably by Cersei, but don&rsquo;t be surprised if this kidnapping has a twist. In season 1, in the scene where Cersei and the small council is forcing Sansa to write down a letter to Rob Stark demanding him to bend the knee to King Joffrey., we have Maester Pycelle warning Cersei that Sansa may be so sweet and innocent now, but once she is older, she may hatch some treasons!!!!</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;she (Sansa) may be a sweet thing now Your Grace, but in 10 YEARS, who knows what treasons she may hatch!!!!&rdquo;</p><p>(SEASON 1 EPISODE 8)</p><p><br /></p></blockquote><p>Now, we know that Sansa did learn a lot from Cersei and maybe now she is finally ready to outsmart her former teacher&hellip; This was the first foreshadowing of Sansa&rsquo;s plans to cast down Cersei.</p><p>And in season 6, we have another foreshadowing of how Sansa will plot against Cersei in the end, When Arya is in Braavos, she watches a Bravossi Theather play telling the events that happened in Westeros. In that storyline, the actress that plays Sansa hires a faceless man to kill the actress who plays Cersei, Lady Crane. I believe this was another foreshadowing of the events that will happen in season 8. Its Sansa who is taking Cersei down. The little dove will prove to the queen that she learned all her lessons. But I believe Jon Snow will be the one killing Cersei.</p><p><br /></p><h2>EPISODE 5 WILL BE THE DANCE OF DRAGONS;</h2><p><br /></p><blockquote><p>He was no dragon, Dany thought, curiously calm. Fire cannot kill a dragon.</p><p>(A Game of Thrones - Daenerys V)</p><p><br /></p></blockquote><p><br /></p><p>Well I believe thats exactly whats its gonna happen. In order to defeat Daenerys you have to kill her last dragon, Drogon, which we know will be flying over Kings Landing in the end of this story. Thats how the wildfire comes in. I actually think Jon and the Lannisters may set a trap for Dany and use the wildfire to kill the dragon and Daenery&rsquo;s remain armies. Maybe Bran was behind King Aerys decision to cover KL with wildfire, already preparing to use against Daenerys in the finall battle for the Throne. if we rewatch season 5 episode 7 we had a little hint about this idea.</p><p><br /></p><blockquote><p>DAARIO: On the day of the Great Games, gather all the great masters, and wise masters, and worthy masters you can find, and slaughter them all.</p><p>DAENERYS: I am a queen. Not a butcher.</p><p>DAARIO: All rulers are either butchers or meat.</p><p><br /></p></blockquote><p><br /></p><p>Remember that Bran&rsquo;s first chapter he is forced to watch his father doing the Kings&rsquo;s justice and Ned explains to him that &ldquo;the man who passes the sentence, must swing the sword&rdquo;. This is one of the most important themes in the story.</p><p>Also, in season 4 episode 2, we have Bran having a vision of the events that will happen for the first time. This is THE vision where he sees the dragon flying over KL. After the vision he tells Jojen and Meera: &ldquo;I know where we have to go&rdquo;. The show then cuts to a scene in Kings Landing.</p><p>So, I do believe Bran will be involved with the explosion of Kings Landing and using the wildfire as a last weapon to defeat Daenerys and her last dragon. Thats the only way Westeros will ever be free of the Targaryens.</p><p>BTW, gathering all your enemies in a closed space and destroying them with fire has been used by both mad queens, Cersei and Daenerys, so maybe now we will see the Starks using this idea to finally get rid of Daenerys, her armies and her dragon.</p><p><br /></p><h2>THE FUTURE OF HOUSE LANNISTER</h2><p>No, House Lannister will not fall into nothing like the Targaryens. The House will be saved by Jaime Lannister, who will marry Brienne of Tarth and restore his family and legacy.</p><p><br /></p><h2>JAIME LANNISTER ITS GOING TO BE THE FINAL HAND AND ITS GOING TO END THIS STORY AS A GREAT HERO;</h2><p><br /></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/73b5389c30d8ef91064c03b6c0a5f945/tumblr_inline_pm5ueyWqgV1sgp768_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Jaime Lannister will choose Jon Snow, this will be the turning point for Jaime and the choice that will change his legacy. There is some very good foreshadowing in the books that hint to us that Jaime will side with Jon Snow in the final battle and help him to defeat Daenerys and her dragons.<br /></p><p>I believe it will be Jaime who will kill Daenerys last dragon, Drogon, and becoming famous as a DRAGONSLAYER; Jaime Lannister will have a big role in the final part of this story, not only helping defeat the ARMY OF THE DEAD, but also defeating Daenerys Targaryen and saving the Kingdom once again from a tyrannical Targaryen; only this time he will finally receive the thank you, from the people of Westeros;</p><p>Jaime will be greeted as a hero and will end this story beloved and admired by the people. I believe at some point in season 8 Jaime will die and will be brought back to life, his character was written as a mirror to Jon Snow and Jon died on season 5, so this storyline may be possible.</p><p>Jaime will be the Hand of the King for Jon Snow (there is a lot of foreshadowing for this, in both books and tv show) and he will be able to finish his history in the white book as a hero. He will go down in history as one of the greatest Hands in the history of the 7 kingdoms. Jaime will be the last Lannister left on Westeros.</p><p><br /></p><h2>TYRION WILL BE SENT INTO EXILE;</h2><p><br /></p><p>Tyrion will have to face a trial for a third time and this time he will be guilty of his crimes. Yeah, that is not a prediction, it&rsquo;s a spoiler, but I already expected that. George loves his 3. Tyrion its one of the characters that will have a very tragic ending. He was the fool who brought Daenerys to Westeros believing he could control her, the same mistake his sister Cersei tried to do with Joffrey. He invited Jon Snow under false premises to Dragonstone without mentioning to Jon about Daenerys demands to bend the knee.</p><p>He made a deal with Cersei that was never disclosed to the audience and I believe he may be behind Sansa&rsquo;s kidnapping story in season 8. He keeps making one mistake after the other, always believing to be smarter than the people around him, always under estimating the players of the game.</p><p>But I don&rsquo;t believe he will die. In the House videos released for season 8, they had the Lannisters brothers, Jaime and Tyrion, saying goodbye to each other and I believe we will see them say good bye one last time. I think Tyrion will be sent into exile to Essos, and banned from returning to Westeros.</p><p><br /></p><h2>CERSEI WILL DIE;</h2><p>There has been a lot of foreshadowing about Cersei death and its one of the events many believe it happen for sure. The show made sure to write us a scene when her ending is predicted.</p><p><br /></p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;I will hurt you for this. A day will come when you think you&rsquo;re safe and happy and your joy will turn to ashes in your mouth. And you will know the debt is paid.&rdquo;</p><p>(Tyrion - SEASON 2 EPISODE 8)</p><p><br /></p></blockquote><p><br /></p><p>This episode was written by George RRMartin himself, so, I always assumed this was Cersei Lannister ending&hellip; Then in season 7, we had Jon Snow threatening to kill Littlefinger is he ever touched Sansa. In that scene we have Jon Snow choking Baelish with his cold hands and I believe this scene could be a foreshadow of Jon finally killing Cersei, for trying to hurt Sansa in season 8. The prophecy says that Cersei will be killed by the &ldquo;little brother&rdquo; and Jon Snow fits that role as the younger son of Rheagar Targaryen.</p><p>_______________________________________________________________</p><p><br /></p><h2>THEON WILL BE KING OF THE IRON ISLANDS;</h2><p>He lifted his head to look at her. &ldquo;Catelyn,&rdquo; he said. His voice was distant and formal. &ldquo;Where are the children?&rdquo;</p><p>A Game of Thrones - Catelyn I</p><p>I believe the children of Wintefell were always meant to be the heroes of this story. That&rsquo;s why George made sure to have a Greyjoy, a Targaryen be raised close to the Stark children. Those children now are gonna be the rulers of Westeros and they will be the ones passing Ned Stark legacy forward, building a new and better world.</p><p>Thast why I believe Theon will kill Euron Greyjoy and be the king of the Iron Islands; Theon probably has a bastard child with the captain&rsquo;s daughter he met in season 2 on his journey to Pike, he will recognize the child and raise them as his heir;</p><h2>A TIME FOR WOLVES;</h2><p><b><br /></b></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e6eaee32c64120ed47c03b3bc7061f9d/tumblr_inline_pm5uvnO0W51sgp768_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p><br /></p><p>It will be a Time for Wolves; a new period for Westeros. Jon will rule surrounded by Starks, carrying the Stark name with Sansa and Bran by his side; The capital will probably be transferred to HighGarden, not only the castle it is still intact but its also located in the most fertile area of Westeros. It seems like a very interesting political decision. Again, I found a lot of foreshadowing for this in the books.</p><p>Jon Snow will rule over a graveyard, as he predicted in season 7. But the ending will be very sweet, with kids playing around in gardens and celebrating. We will see Jon, the Stark kids, Jaime and Brienne, Sam and Guilly, Theon&hellip;.. ect all enjoying spring and celebrating their happy ending.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><h2>THE VERY LAST SCENE OF THE STORY&hellip;..</h2><p><br /></p><p>Daniel Abraham is the man responsible for converting the Game of Thrones book into a comic, mentioned that there is a particular line of dialog in the game of thrones book, which is very important for the last scene of &ldquo;A Dream of Spring&rdquo;.</p><p>Have you collaborated at all with George R.R. Martin in the process of adapting the novel to comics? If so, what&rsquo;s the creative process there?</p><p>Daniel: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve spoken to George a lot in the process. The biggest issues we have are continuity questions. There are things about this story that only he knows, and they aren&rsquo;t all obvious. There was one scene I had to rework because there&rsquo;s a particular line of dialog &ndash; and you wouldn&rsquo;t know it to look at &ndash; that&rsquo;s important in the last scene of &ldquo;A Dream of Spring.&rdquo;- Daniel Abraham</p><p>On episode 1, when King Robert goes to visit Winterfell, he and Ned go down in the crypts to pay their respects to Lyanna Stark, the wolf girl he lost to Rheagar Targeryen. In that scene, the dialogue is different from what we have in the books.</p><p><br /></p><blockquote><p>ROBERT: Did you have to bury her in a place like this? She should be on a hill somewhere with the sun and the clouds above her.</p><p>NED: She was my sister. This is where she belongs.</p><p><br /></p></blockquote><p>In the books, this conversation is different:</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><blockquote><p>\"Ah, damn it, Ned, did you have to bury her in a place like this?&rdquo; His voice was hoarse with remembered grief. &ldquo;She deserved more than darkness &hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She was a Stark of Winterfell,&rdquo; Ned said quietly. &ldquo;This is her place.&rdquo;</p><p>A Game of Thrones - Eddard I</p><p><br /></p></blockquote><p>I think this is the scene. I believe we will end this story with King Jon visiting his late wife Sansa Stark in the crypts of Winterfell and someone will ask him why did he buried her there, why not building a monument for her, so that she could be on display and that&rsquo;s how he will reply:<br /></p><p><br /></p><blockquote><p>She was a Stark of Winterfell, this is where she belongs&hellip;.</p><p><br /></p></blockquote><p>What made me believe this, were two momments of the story: First of all, Lady&rsquo;s death. After Sansa direwolf is killed on her way to the south, Ned Stark makes sure to send a group of men back to the North and Winterfell, so that she can be buried in Northerner soil. Lady represented a little bit of Sansa, who died on that day and I dont think it was a silly detail George rrmartin make sure that her direwolf body was buried on Winterfell, I think that this scene, was much more important than most people think about it.</p><p><br /></p><blockquote><p>When it was over, he said, &ldquo;Choose four men and have them take the body north. <b>Bury her at Winterfell</b>.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;All that way?&rdquo; Jory said, astonished.&ldquo;All that way,&rdquo; Ned affirmed. &ldquo;The Lannister woman shall never have this skin.&rdquo;</p><p>A Game of Thrones - Eddard III</p><p><br /></p></blockquote><p>Another momment in the story was Ygritte death. In both books and show, Jon Snow takes her body and goes to bury her up North, where she belonged.</p><p><br /></p><blockquote><p>Tormund: Did you love her? She loved you.</p><p>Jon: She told you?</p><p>Tormund: No. All she ever talked about was killing you. That&rsquo;s how I know. <b>She belongs in the North. The real North.</b> You understand me?</p><p><br /></p></blockquote><p><br /></p><p>Look at the excuse Tormund gives Jon to why Ygritte needs to be buried North of the Wall, its the same Ned Stark used to explain to King Robert why Lyanna had to be buried in the Crypts of Winterfell. Because thats where she belongs&hellip;&hellip;.</p><p>I also believe this ending could bring the story to a full circle, because there is also the theme of the audience never really thinking as Sansa as a TRUE STARK. There is still the notion that Sansa is not really a Stark like Jon or Arya.</p><p>Sansa Starkiness was always a topic of contention among fans of the books and series. Many like to refer to Sansa as Lady Lannister or Lady Bolton, so to have Sansa finally resting in the Winterfell crypts, by the end of this story, as a Stark, would be a very satisfying ending. Her hair maybe red and some of her manners may be more southern like, but Sansa IS A STARK.</p><p>And in fact, she is the Stark who took back the North and Winterfell, she is the Stark who made possible for the family to reunite and be safe; she is the Stark who stood by Jon side when he was made King in the North and supported his claim; she was the Stark who prepared the North for the wars and the winter and she will be the Stark who will rule the 7 Kingdoms together with her husband.</p><p>Both Jon and Sansa are foreshadowed to live very long lives and I expect their ruling period to last decades. They will be the ones restoring and rebuilding the kingdom after the wars of Ice and Fire. But I do believe Jon will live longer based on a quote from the books.</p><p><br /></p><blockquote><p>Tyrion shared around his skin of wine until even Yoren grew mellow. <b>One by one the company drifted off to their shelters and to sleep, all but Jon Snow, who had drawn the night&rsquo;s first watch.</b> Tyrion was the last to retire, as always. As he stepped into the shelter his men had built for him, he paused and looked back at Jon Snow. The boy stood near the fire, his face still and hard, looking deep into the flames. Tyrion Lannister smiled sadly and went to bed. -<br />AGOT Tyrion II</p></blockquote><p><br /></p><p>And because of this line, I believe Jon Snow ill be the last one to die, he will live a very long life and will be forced to see all the ones he loved pass away, one by one.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><h2>THE END OF GAME OF THRONES&hellip;</h2></p>",
