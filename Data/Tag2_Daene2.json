Even now. Especially now, as she lay resting against the pillows, eyes closed, the babe suckling contentedly at her breast.</p><p><br/></p><p>Just a few hours ago, she\u2019d birthed their boy into the world, tiny but apple-cheeked, a wisp of downy white curls and clouded dark eyes that had only opened for a few moments.</p><p><br/></p><p>It amazed Jon, that he could make something so perfect. So pure. The stain of his life as a bastard was still with him, that thing that told him he would never be good enough, not for his father, not for his family, not for the North, not for her . But she was the first to accept him as he was, she did not look down her nose at this base born king, and she probably loved him more because of it.  Even if it wasn\u2019t true, in his core, Jon Snow was who he would always be, and Jon Snow was who she wanted.</p><p><br/></p><p>The events that led them here had been a whirlwind. Enough time had passed for them to meet, distrust one another, fall in love, make a baby, and fight together in two wars, but it seemed no time at all. Their love was born of turmoil and trauma; the fight against the dead, the loss of friends and dragons and, for a while, each other, as they grappled with the truth of his parentage. Grief, mistrust, even betrayal had sought to drive them apart, but she\u2019d walked through fire more than once, and this time he went with her. All was not well, not entirely, but he was determined to put it right. His love for her was more than enough motivation, but witnessing the birth of their son forged his will like Valyrian steel.</p><p><br/></p><p>Jon sat carefully on the edge of the mattress, his weight depressing it enough to stir Dany from her light sleep.  Her eyes opened and she smiled sweetly at him, and she\u2019d never looked more beautiful, disheveled hair and tired, shadowed eyes and all.  What she\u2019d done should not be humanly possible, even though women did it every day, and she made impossible things happen. He was so proud, so full of love and devotion and protective instinct, he was ready to burst. He had to fight the urge to run through the corridors of the castle, to shout his joy from the clifftops of their ancestral home, to proclaim it from Dorne to the Wall and across the Narrow Sea that he was a father, and she was a mother, that they were a family, that the Targaryens were not gone.</p><p><br/></p><p>He dipped his head and placed a kiss on the baby\u2019s brow. The boy\u2019s mouth was slack, but when Dany tried to remove him from her breast he latched on determinedly, suckling away, his little lips and jowls moving in perfect rhythm, even if her milk hadn\u2019t come in yet to give him much to swallow.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cGreedy lad,\u201d he whispered, a grin splitting his face, reaching his eyes.  </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s had a long day.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cI could fetch the wet nurse if you want to rest.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Dany cooed, brushing her fingers lightly over the babe\u2019s forehead.  \u201cA bit longer.\u201d She kissed the top of his head and inhaled, relishing that infant smell.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cI&hellip;um&hellip;I have something for you,\u201d Jon said tentatively.  He fumbled around to reach into the pocket of his trousers, and pulled out a polished wooden box on which was carved a sigil, an amalgamation of a dragon and a wolf, an image in his mind\u2019s eye that the wood carver had perfectly captured.</p><p><br/></p><p>Dany\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cYou\u2019ve never given me a gift before.\u201d   Except him, her face seemed to say.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s long overdue.  Open it.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>She tried with one hand as the other was trapped by the babe, but Jon impatiently took it from her, feeling silly that he\u2019d already mucked this up, berating himself for his thoughtlessness. He just wanted this to be special.  He worked the latch and opened the lid. The box was lined with a cushion of red silk, and buried within was a necklace.</p><p><br/></p><p>He\u2019d never seen her wear a necklace or much jewelry at all; she had two rings ever present on the first fingers of both hands, the three-headed dragon chain she donned with her more formal dresses, and a pin she sometimes wore in her braids, but he took a chance anyway and commissioned it from a jewler in King\u2019s Landing about a month ago, waiting for the proper time to present it.</p><p><br/></p><p>Gingerly, he removed the necklace from the box and held it by its silver chain. From the chain hung a pendant, a smooth and egg-shaped piece of obsidian, polished such that it shone almost like a black diamond. Tendrils of silver branches wrapped around the bauble, holding the glass in their thin fingers.</p><p><br/></p><p>He saw her eyes moisten as she reached for it, and he dropped it into her free hand, watching expectantly as she held the pendant between her thumb and forefinger.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cIs this\u2026.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cDragonglass,\u201d he said quietly, so as not to disturb the babe.  \u201cNot some rare or precious stone, but\u2026.it\u2019s the reason we met. I had it made for you.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cI love it,\u201d she said with a watery smile, her lips quivering, begging to be tasted.  \u201cIt\u2019s beautiful, Jon.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re beautiful,\u201d he countered, taking it from her hand and opening the clasp, then leaning forward to place it around her neck.  When it was accomplished his hand strayed to cup her cheek, and his eyes became solemn. \u201cDany, I know we have a ways to go, for things to be like they once were.  Maybe they never can be again. But I never want you to doubt that I love you. Not just as my family, not just as my son\u2019s mother, not just as my Queen.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cJon, I know\u2026\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>He interrupted her with the brush of his thumb over her full lips.  \u201cI\u2019ve said it before but I\u2019ll say it again. I\u2019m sorry for everything that happened. I\u2019m sorry I hurt you, that I wasn\u2019t there for you when you needed me most. It will never happen again.  You are my world. You, and our boy, and I\u2019m not just sayin\u2019 that because I\u2019m in this daze of new fatherhood. I mean it. I love you, Daenerys Stormborn. I will always love you. That I ever made you doubt it was the greatest mistake in a lifetime full of mistakes.  Can you forgive me?\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>She could no longer hold in her tears, and the trickled freely down her cheeks, dotting the baby\u2019s face, but he was oblivious.  Gently, Jon wiped them away from her eyes with the pad of his thumb, while he anxiously awaited her answer.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cThere is nothing to forgive, Jon. I made mistakes too. The best thing we can do is put them behind us. We can\u2019t change the past. We can only hope to never repeat it.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>Jon touched his forehead to hers, taking care to avoid squashing the baby between their bodies.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cWe won\u2019t,\u201d he assured her, as he lowered his lips to brush hers.  \u201cI am yours, and you are mine.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>Notes:</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cThat I ever made you doubt it was the greatest mistake in a lifetime full of mistakes.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>I can\u2019t take credit for this line.

Even now. Especially now, as she lay resting against the pillows, eyes closed, the babe suckling contentedly at her breast.</p><p><br></p><p>Just a few hours ago, she\u2019d birthed their boy into the world, tiny but apple-cheeked, a wisp of downy white curls and clouded dark eyes that had only opened for a few moments.</p><p><br></p><p>It amazed Jon, that he could make something so perfect. So pure. The stain of his life as a bastard was still with him, that thing that told him he would never be good enough, not for his father, not for his family, not for the North, not for her . But she was the first to accept him as he was, she did not look down her nose at this base born king, and she probably loved him more because of it.  Even if it wasn\u2019t true, in his core, Jon Snow was who he would always be, and Jon Snow was who she wanted.</p><p><br></p><p>The events that led them here had been a whirlwind. Enough time had passed for them to meet, distrust one another, fall in love, make a baby, and fight together in two wars, but it seemed no time at all. Their love was born of turmoil and trauma; the fight against the dead, the loss of friends and dragons and, for a while, each other, as they grappled with the truth of his parentage. Grief, mistrust, even betrayal had sought to drive them apart, but she\u2019d walked through fire more than once, and this time he went with her. All was not well, not entirely, but he was determined to put it right. His love for her was more than enough motivation, but witnessing the birth of their son forged his will like Valyrian steel.</p><p><br></p><p>Jon sat carefully on the edge of the mattress, his weight depressing it enough to stir Dany from her light sleep.  Her eyes opened and she smiled sweetly at him, and she\u2019d never looked more beautiful, disheveled hair and tired, shadowed eyes and all.  What she\u2019d done should not be humanly possible, even though women did it every day, and she made impossible things happen. He was so proud, so full of love and devotion and protective instinct, he was ready to burst. He had to fight the urge to run through the corridors of the castle, to shout his joy from the clifftops of their ancestral home, to proclaim it from Dorne to the Wall and across the Narrow Sea that he was a father, and she was a mother, that they were a family, that the Targaryens were not gone.</p><p><br></p><p>He dipped his head and placed a kiss on the baby\u2019s brow. The boy\u2019s mouth was slack, but when Dany tried to remove him from her breast he latched on determinedly, suckling away, his little lips and jowls moving in perfect rhythm, even if her milk hadn\u2019t come in yet to give him much to swallow.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cGreedy lad,\u201d he whispered, a grin splitting his face, reaching his eyes.  </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s had a long day.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI could fetch the wet nurse if you want to rest.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Dany cooed, brushing her fingers lightly over the babe\u2019s forehead.  \u201cA bit longer.\u201d She kissed the top of his head and inhaled, relishing that infant smell.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI\u2026um\u2026I have something for you,\u201d Jon said tentatively.  He fumbled around to reach into the pocket of his trousers, and pulled out a polished wooden box on which was carved a sigil, an amalgamation of a dragon and a wolf, an image in his mind\u2019s eye that the wood carver had perfectly captured.</p><p><br></p><p>Dany\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cYou\u2019ve never given me a gift before.\u201d   Except him, her face seemed to say.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s long overdue.  Open it.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>She tried with one hand as the other was trapped by the babe, but Jon impatiently took it from her, feeling silly that he\u2019d already mucked this up, berating himself for his thoughtlessness. He just wanted this to be special.  He worked the latch and opened the lid. The box was lined with a cushion of red silk, and buried within was a necklace.</p><p><br></p><p>He\u2019d never seen her wear a necklace or much jewelry at all; she had two rings ever present on the first fingers of both hands, the three-headed dragon chain she donned with her more formal dresses, and a pin she sometimes wore in her braids, but he took a chance anyway and commissioned it from a jewler in King\u2019s Landing about a month ago, waiting for the proper time to present it.</p><p><br></p><p>Gingerly, he removed the necklace from the box and held it by its silver chain. From the chain hung a pendant, a smooth and egg-shaped piece of obsidian, polished such that it shone almost like a black diamond. Tendrils of silver branches wrapped around the bauble, holding the glass in their thin fingers.</p><p><br></p><p>He saw her eyes moisten as she reached for it, and he dropped it into her free hand, watching expectantly as she held the pendant between her thumb and forefinger.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cIs this\u2026.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cDragonglass,\u201d he said quietly, so as not to disturb the babe.  \u201cNot some rare or precious stone, but\u2026.it\u2019s the reason we met. I had it made for you.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI love it,\u201d she said with a watery smile, her lips quivering, begging to be tasted.  \u201cIt\u2019s beautiful, Jon.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re beautiful,\u201d he countered, taking it from her hand and opening the clasp, then leaning forward to place it around her neck.  When it was accomplished his hand strayed to cup her cheek, and his eyes became solemn. \u201cDany, I know we have a ways to go, for things to be like they once were.  Maybe they never can be again. But I never want you to doubt that I love you. Not just as my family, not just as my son\u2019s mother, not just as my Queen.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cJon, I know\u2026\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>He interrupted her with the brush of his thumb over her full lips.  \u201cI\u2019ve said it before but I\u2019ll say it again. I\u2019m sorry for everything that happened. I\u2019m sorry I hurt you, that I wasn\u2019t there for you when you needed me most. It will never happen again.  You are my world. You, and our boy, and I\u2019m not just sayin\u2019 that because I\u2019m in this daze of new fatherhood. I mean it. I love you, Daenerys Stormborn. I will always love you. That I ever made you doubt it was the greatest mistake in a lifetime full of mistakes.  Can you forgive me?\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>She could no longer hold in her tears, and the trickled freely down her cheeks, dotting the baby\u2019s face, but he was oblivious.  Gently, Jon wiped them away from her eyes with the pad of his thumb, while he anxiously awaited her answer.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cThere is nothing to forgive, Jon. I made mistakes too. The best thing we can do is put them behind us. We can\u2019t change the past. We can only hope to never repeat it.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>Jon touched his forehead to hers, taking care to avoid squashing the baby between their bodies.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cWe won\u2019t,\u201d he assured her, as he lowered his lips to brush hers.  \u201cI am yours, and you are mine.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>Notes:</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cThat I ever made you doubt it was the greatest mistake in a lifetime full of mistakes.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>I can\u2019t take credit for this line.

Even now. Especially now, as she lay resting against the pillows, eyes closed, the babe suckling contentedly at her breast.</p><p><br /></p><p>Just a few hours ago, she&rsquo;d birthed their boy into the world, tiny but apple-cheeked, a wisp of downy white curls and clouded dark eyes that had only opened for a few moments.</p><p><br /></p><p>It amazed Jon, that he could make something so perfect. So pure. The stain of his life as a bastard was still with him, that thing that told him he would never be good enough, not for his father, not for his family, not for the North, not for her . But she was the first to accept him as he was, she did not look down her nose at this base born king, and she probably loved him more because of it.  Even if it wasn&rsquo;t true, in his core, Jon Snow was who he would always be, and Jon Snow was who she wanted.</p><p><br /></p><p>The events that led them here had been a whirlwind. Enough time had passed for them to meet, distrust one another, fall in love, make a baby, and fight together in two wars, but it seemed no time at all. Their love was born of turmoil and trauma; the fight against the dead, the loss of friends and dragons and, for a while, each other, as they grappled with the truth of his parentage. Grief, mistrust, even betrayal had sought to drive them apart, but she&rsquo;d walked through fire more than once, and this time he went with her. All was not well, not entirely, but he was determined to put it right. His love for her was more than enough motivation, but witnessing the birth of their son forged his will like Valyrian steel.</p><p><br /></p><p>Jon sat carefully on the edge of the mattress, his weight depressing it enough to stir Dany from her light sleep.  Her eyes opened and she smiled sweetly at him, and she&rsquo;d never looked more beautiful, disheveled hair and tired, shadowed eyes and all.  What she&rsquo;d done should not be humanly possible, even though women did it every day, and she made impossible things happen. He was so proud, so full of love and devotion and protective instinct, he was ready to burst. He had to fight the urge to run through the corridors of the castle, to shout his joy from the clifftops of their ancestral home, to proclaim it from Dorne to the Wall and across the Narrow Sea that he was a father, and she was a mother, that they were a family, that the Targaryens were not gone.</p><p><br /></p><p>He dipped his head and placed a kiss on the baby&rsquo;s brow. The boy&rsquo;s mouth was slack, but when Dany tried to remove him from her breast he latched on determinedly, suckling away, his little lips and jowls moving in perfect rhythm, even if her milk hadn&rsquo;t come in yet to give him much to swallow.</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Greedy lad,&rdquo; he whispered, a grin splitting his face, reaching his eyes.  </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s had a long day.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;I could fetch the wet nurse if you want to rest.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Dany cooed, brushing her fingers lightly over the babe&rsquo;s forehead.  &ldquo;A bit longer.&rdquo; She kissed the top of his head and inhaled, relishing that infant smell.</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;I&hellip;um&hellip;I have something for you,&rdquo; Jon said tentatively.  He fumbled around to reach into the pocket of his trousers, and pulled out a polished wooden box on which was carved a sigil, an amalgamation of a dragon and a wolf, an image in his mind&rsquo;s eye that the wood carver had perfectly captured.</p><p><br /></p><p>Dany&rsquo;s eyes widened. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve never given me a gift before.&rdquo;   Except him, her face seemed to say.</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s long overdue.  Open it.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>She tried with one hand as the other was trapped by the babe, but Jon impatiently took it from her, feeling silly that he&rsquo;d already mucked this up, berating himself for his thoughtlessness. He just wanted this to be special.  He worked the latch and opened the lid. The box was lined with a cushion of red silk, and buried within was a necklace.</p><p><br /></p><p>He&rsquo;d never seen her wear a necklace or much jewelry at all; she had two rings ever present on the first fingers of both hands, the three-headed dragon chain she donned with her more formal dresses, and a pin she sometimes wore in her braids, but he took a chance anyway and commissioned it from a jewler in King&rsquo;s Landing about a month ago, waiting for the proper time to present it.</p><p><br /></p><p>Gingerly, he removed the necklace from the box and held it by its silver chain. From the chain hung a pendant, a smooth and egg-shaped piece of obsidian, polished such that it shone almost like a black diamond. Tendrils of silver branches wrapped around the bauble, holding the glass in their thin fingers.</p><p><br /></p><p>He saw her eyes moisten as she reached for it, and he dropped it into her free hand, watching expectantly as she held the pendant between her thumb and forefinger.</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Is this&hellip;.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Dragonglass,&rdquo; he said quietly, so as not to disturb the babe.  &ldquo;Not some rare or precious stone, but&hellip;.it&rsquo;s the reason we met. I had it made for you.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;I love it,&rdquo; she said with a watery smile, her lips quivering, begging to be tasted.  &ldquo;It&rsquo;s beautiful, Jon.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re beautiful,&rdquo; he countered, taking it from her hand and opening the clasp, then leaning forward to place it around her neck.  When it was accomplished his hand strayed to cup her cheek, and his eyes became solemn. &ldquo;Dany, I know we have a ways to go, for things to be like they once were.  Maybe they never can be again. But I never want you to doubt that I love you. Not just as my family, not just as my son&rsquo;s mother, not just as my Queen.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Jon, I know&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>He interrupted her with the brush of his thumb over her full lips.  &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve said it before but I&rsquo;ll say it again. I&rsquo;m sorry for everything that happened. I&rsquo;m sorry I hurt you, that I wasn&rsquo;t there for you when you needed me most. It will never happen again.  You are my world. You, and our boy, and I&rsquo;m not just sayin&rsquo; that because I&rsquo;m in this daze of new fatherhood. I mean it. I love you, Daenerys Stormborn. I will always love you. That I ever made you doubt it was the greatest mistake in a lifetime full of mistakes.  Can you forgive me?&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>She could no longer hold in her tears, and the trickled freely down her cheeks, dotting the baby&rsquo;s face, but he was oblivious.  Gently, Jon wiped them away from her eyes with the pad of his thumb, while he anxiously awaited her answer.</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;There is nothing to forgive, Jon. I made mistakes too. The best thing we can do is put them behind us. We can&rsquo;t change the past. We can only hope to never repeat it.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>Jon touched his forehead to hers, taking care to avoid squashing the baby between their bodies.</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he assured her, as he lowered his lips to brush hers.  &ldquo;I am yours, and you are mine.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>Notes:</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;That I ever made you doubt it was the greatest mistake in a lifetime full of mistakes.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>I can&rsquo;t take credit for this line.

Dare I say (ahhh fuck it I&rsquo;ll scream it to the heavens and hells) THIS COULD&rsquo;VE BEEN THE SCRIPT FOR THE SHOW!!!! In fact I&rsquo;ll go as far as to say that  this SHOULD&rsquo;VE been the script for the show. This story is up to 90 chapters so far and the author ISN&rsquo;T EVEN FINISHED WITH IT YET!!!!! I&rsquo;ve re-read it at least a dozen times already and I&rsquo;m spreading it far and wide for my fellow Jonerys soldiers. I HIGHLY implore you all to read it, and spread it to your friends, and of course show this author the love and support they deserve for masterfully writing this EPIC fanfic!!
