They get along well and it\u2019s just a safe place for him to go back to when things are getting too much in his life. But january is here and he\u2019s about to start at his new school. What he doesn\u2019t expect is to bump into the person he\u2019s been texting with. Suddenly Eliott\u2019s life going upside down as he both tries to approach and avoid Lucas at the same time. </b></p><!-- more --><hr><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><h2><b>Beers and joints</b></h2><p><br/></p><p>Eliott was staring at his phone since hours now. He put it on the coffee table right after posting that selfie on insta and didn\u2019t dare to touch it ever since. He was afraid of Lucas\u2019 reaction. He saw that he commented and sent him a few messages in their chat, but he just couldn\u2019t check it. It was only one week, not more than that and the boy would probably understand his reasons, but it was still scary. What if Lucas never wants to speak to him again? What if he <b>does</b> what to speak to him again? How they should act around each other in school now? Should he avoid Lucas? Will Lucas avoid him? All these questions flooded his mind at the same time and he felt like drowning.</p><p>He wanted to call Idriss or Sofiane, but for that he would have to touch his phone and if he does, he won\u2019t be able to keep himself away from <b>the</b> app. So instead he put on some music, looking through his vinyl collection, finding some Harry Potter soundtrack be his best distraction. He also collected his pet snake to be his company while he suffers on the couch. He let him to wrap itself around his arm, just chilling there quietly, while he leant back, lighting a rolled cigarette.</p><p>It was around midnight when he ran out of tobacco, so he couldn\u2019t smoke anymore, plus the record ended like hours ago, only making some scratchy noises that filled the air. Nagi wandered up from his arm to his shoulders, rolling into a spiral, sleeping peacefully. He got startled when his phone buzzed on the coffee table. He made sure his pet is not falling off his shoulder as he leant forward to grab it, checking the notifications finally.\u00a0</p><p>He had messages from Sofiane, Idriss, Imane and most importantly Lucas. It took him a few minutes to prepare himself. He was still afraid, but he couldn\u2019t avoid things any longer. First he checked the comment under his photo. Okay, it wasn\u2019t that bad. Then he went to his DMs, opening his chat with the boy.</p><p><b>lucallemant</b><br/>Are you for real?\u00a0<br/>How could you be such a dick?!\u00a0<br/>We met TWICE and you said nothing?\u00a0<br/>Answer me, for fucks sake!\u00a0<br/>Eli<br/>Fuck, say something, Eliott!\u00a0<br/>You said you can explain, then EXPLAIN<br/>Okay, I\u2019m done, going to sleep\u00a0<br/></p><p>Eliott sighed and rubbed his palm on his face a couple time, cursing under his breath. He was such an idiot for being so scared that he didn\u2019t answer him right away. But this wasn\u2019t making him feel better, because he still had no idea how he should be acting around Lucas in school. Should he approach him and talk about this in person or just avoid him and smooth things out in text? He got up from the couch, pocketing his phone, taking Nagini back to his terrarium, After that he decided to take a quick shower and going to sleep himself too.\u00a0</p><p><br/></p><p>As he walked into the school building, he felt his palms getting sweaty as he was holding onto the straps of his backpack. He was nervous and fucking paranoid, feeling like Lucas could walk up to him at anytime, slapping him on the face and yell at him. Even though that didn\u2019t happen, he still couldn\u2019t relax and he hated himself for not being able to respond to those messages, but he had no idea what could be the best answer. He got startled when someone touched his shoulder, spinning around faster than a tornado, letting out a sigh when he noticed that it\u2019s just Alex.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay, bro? You look like you\u2019re going to pass out.\u201d he asked with concern in his voice. Eliott sighed again and messed up his hair a little in frustration.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cNot really. I haven\u2019t slept much.\u201d he answered honestly.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cYeah, you look like a vampire.\u201d he laughed a little and squeezed his shoulder gently.\u00a0\u201cWill you be okay?\u201d he asked curiously. Eliott wanted to answer, reassuring him that he had much worse nights before when a voice interrupted them, coming from behind Alex.<br/></p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t be okay after I finished with him.\u201d the voice was serious and mad, so so mad. Eliott felt his stomach churning as his friend stepped to the side, revealing a really angry looking Lucas, arms crossed in front of his chest, hair looking like he had an argument with a fan and his eyes, those beautiful blue eyes now looked like frozen water, cold and hard.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know you two knew each other.\u201d Alex said surprised, not understanding the short one\u2019s grumpiness.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cWe do, but can you leave us alone now, Alex? Please.\u201d his voice got softer as he talked to the other boy and Eliott felt just a tiny bit of jealousy because of it. He wanted Lucas to talk to him like that, to not be angry, but be happy, soft and flirty.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cSure. See you on class, Eliott.\u201d he said, shooting an apologetic smile and walked away. It was obvious that he knew it\u2019s better not to piss off Lucas even more, but he was also afraid of what\u2019s going to happen to his classmate. Eliott let out a sigh, eyes fixed on the short boy\u2019s face.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cHey, Lucas.\u201d He mumbled, regretting the moment he said it, because he could basically see the boy in front of him flaming up. He remembered that moment of Hades from Hercules when he goes full red in anger. Lucas seemed to be not far from looking like that.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cI so wanna punch you in the face right now.\u201d he huffed, looking at him with sparkling anger in his eyes.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cWell, you did just that with a door yesterday.\u201d he said with a weak smile on his face, trying to light up the mood somehow.<br/></p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare.\u201d Lucas said, raising up his finger.\u00a0\u201cDon\u2019t you dare bringing up yesterday. I swear to god&hellip;.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, okay.\u201d he sighed, scratching the back of his neck now.\u00a0\u201cI was staring at my phone for hours, being afraid of your reaction.\u201d he mumbled honestly and looked at the ceiling.\u00a0\u201cI knew that you\u2019ll be mad&hellip; but I couldn\u2019t bring myself to tell you sooner.\u201d he explained, but when he brought his eyes back to the boy\u2019s face, it wasn\u2019t pure anger anymore, but combined with some confusion.<br/></p><p>\u201cWait, you think I am mad because you are who you are?\u201d he asked raising his eyebrows, Eliott felt confused for a minute too.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d it was more of a question than a statement.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cAre you serious?\u201d he looked at him like Eliott just said that he\u2019s going to be the next presient or something.\u00a0\u201cI am fucking mad because you ignored me.\u201d he said seriously, still looking angry.\u00a0\u201cYeah, it shocked me when you revealed that fucking handsome face of yours, but I get it why you didn\u2019t tell me sooner.\u201d he sighed, rubbing his hands on his face now in frustration.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cDid you just call me handsome?\u201d Eliott asked, not believeing his ears anymore.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d the short boy said with a face that it\u2019s supposed to be obvious information. The tall one could feel the butterflies raising in his stomach, making him feel weird things now.\u00a0\u201cFuck, you are such an idiot.\u201d he continued, running his fingers through his hair, making even bigger of a mess out of it.\u00a0\u201cI barely slept because of you.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWell, same here.\u201d Eliott sighed now and leaned back to the lockers behind him. His heart skipped a beat when a tiny smile appeared on Lucas\u2019 face.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cAsshole.\u201d he huffed and sighed.\u00a0\u201cYou are just a pain in the ass, I hope you know that.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cYou always make sure that I don\u2019t forget it.\u201d Eliott responded with a wide smile, to which the short boy rolled his eyes.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still mad at you.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cI know that.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cTalk later?\u201d he asked, voice chill now and maybe even a bit playful. Eliott couldn\u2019t believe he was so calm and flirty all of the sudden.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d he muttered and watched the boy walking away. He needed a few minutes to collect his thoughts and register the things that just happened between the two of them. He reached for his phone in his pocket, opening instagram to send a text.\u00a0<br/></p><p><b>srodulv</b><br/>I\u2019m sorry, really</p><p>The reply was basically immediate and Eliott could feel his body tense up as he read it.</p><p><b>lucallemant</b><br/>It\u2019s okay<br/></p><p><b>srodulv</b><br/>See you after school?</p><p><b>lucallemant</b><br/>I\u2019ll check my calendar\u00a0</p><p><b>srodulv</b><br/>Very funny<br/></p><p><b>lucallemant</b><br/>My humor is superior\u00a0</p><p><b>srodulv</b><br/>So, will you let me make this up to you?\u00a0</p><p><b>lucallemant</b><br/>Maybe&hellip;\u00a0</p><p><b>srodulv</b><br/>At my place, some beer and a joint?\u00a0</p><p><b>lucallemant</b><br/>Fine\u00a0</p><p><b>srodulv</b><br/>Meet me at the gate after classes\u00a0</p><p><b>lucallemant</b><br/>I hate you\u00a0</p><p><b>srodulv</b><br/>No you don\u2019t\u00a0\n\n\u2764\ufe0f\n\n</p><p>He was smiling at his phone like an idiot, then he walked to his classes. Alex obviously noticed that he was in a much better mood, but wasn\u2019t asking any questions, which Eliott appreciated a lot. But he mentioned a party that he\u2019s going to host this friday. He asked him if he would like to go and of course Eliott agreed to it. Nothing is better to get himself into the school life than attending to parties.\u00a0</p><p><br/></p><p>He was having lunch with Alex and some of the boy\u2019s friends. He tried to join the conversation, but he kept getting distracted by a certain group of boys sitting a few tables away from them. They were way too loud, especially the curly haired one, Basile if he remembers correctly. The worst thing is that Lucas was sitting right across him, so he had a clear view on his face. And damn if he wasn\u2019t the most beautiful human being around. He looked so carefree and beautiful as he laughed at something his friend was rambling about. He got stratled out of his daze when someone snapped his fingers in front of his face. He looked at Alex confused.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cI asked you a question, Sherlock.\u201d he said rolling his eyes.\u00a0\u201cWill you bring your crush to the party?\u201d he asked with a playful smirk on his face. The others were talking about a different subject, not paying attention to the two of them, which Eliott was grateful for.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cI think he will be there. I don\u2019t know.\u201d he shrugged now, eating some of the parta that was laying untouched in front of him since ten minutes now.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cIs it Lucas?\u201d he asked now, being too impatient with his friend\u2019s mysteriousness and the tall boy could understand him, but he also would rather not talk about this, not until he smooth things out with his little hedgehog.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t wanna talk about it.\u201d he muttered after a minute of silence.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cYou guys had a fight?\u201d he continued the asking and it slowly started to get on Eliott\u2019s nerves. He didn\u2019t like it when people were nosy around him or tried to get into his personal life without his consent. He could feel the anger inside him build up, so he grabbed his tray from the table and got up.<br/></p><p>\u201cGotta go.\u201d that was the only thing he said before he stormed out of the cafeteria, leaving the tray on the shelf by the entrance.\u00a0<br/></p><p>He made his way to one of the bathrooms and locked himself in a stall, sitting up on the toilet, legs pulled up to his chest. This was just so unnecessary, but he couldn\u2019t control his own emotions. His whole day was a fucking ride on a rollercoaster and usually that was when his illness liked to kick in. He also forgot to take his medicines last night, which was also making things worse than they already were. He decided to skip the next class, trying to avoid a possible freakout in front of everyone.\u00a0</p><p>He sighed when he felt his phone buzzing in his pocket. He really hoped that it\u2019s not Alex, because he had no idea what kind of excuse he could make up to his sudden leave. He tried to avoid letting anyone know about his mental health and his struggles. It\u2019s easier to let people think that you are an asshole rather than they think you are crazy or look at you with pity. He fished the device out of his pocket and checked his notifications.\u00a0</p><p><b>lucallemant</b><br/>Are you okay?\u00a0<br/>I saw you storming out of the cafeteria</p><p><b>srodulv</b><br/>I\u2019ll be fine\u00a0</p><p>He looked at the ceiling and let the feeling of warmth spread in his chest. How fucking lucky he was to have someone in his life like Lucas. Even if he was mad at him, he was still worried, trying to reach out when he saw that Eliott was not feeling okay.\u00a0</p><p><b>lucallemant</b><br/>You need me to go there?\u00a0<br/>Where are you?\u00a0</p><p><b>srodulv</b><br/>In the bathroom\u00a0<br/>And no, stay with your friends</p><p><b>lucallemant</b><br/>You are my friend too\u00a0</p><p><b>srodulv</b><br/>Ouch, straight up to the friendzone?\u00a0<br/>You have no mercy</p><p><b>lucallemant</b><br/>Fuck you\u00a0</p><p><b>srodulv\u00a0</b><br/>\n\n\u2764\ufe0f\n<br/></p><p><b>lucallemant</b><br/>But seriously<br/>I can go there if you want</p><p><b>srodulv</b><br/>I kinda wanna be alone right now</p><p><b>lucallemant</b><br/>Do you want me to stop with the texts?\u00a0</p><p><b>srodulv</b><br/>No, that\u2019s fine\u00a0<br/>You are kinda my safe place anyways</p><p><b>lucallemant</b><br/>I\u2019m still mad at you, just so you know\u00a0</p><p><b>srodulv</b><br/>I know and I\u2019m sorry\u00a0</p><p><b>lucallemant</b><br/>Stop apologizing\u00a0<br/>You\u2019re being annoying</p><p><b>srodulv</b><br/>Yeah, breaking news</p><p><b>lucallemant</b><br/>Gotta go to class soon<br/>Text me if you need anything, yeah?\u00a0</p><p><b>srodulv</b><br/>Don\u2019t worry, mom<br/>I will be fine\u00a0</p><p><b>lucallemant</b><br/>Did you just momzoned me?\u00a0<br/>You ass\u00a0</p><p><b>srodulv</b><br/>Go to class, Lucas\u00a0\n\n\u2764\ufe0f\n\n</p><p><b>lucallemant</b><br/>Have fun in the toilet\u00a0\n\n\u2764\ufe0f\n\n</p><p>Eliott giggled just a little, but then he noticed that Lucas also posted a picture on insta. When he saw it, his heart started to beat faster, huge grin appearing on his face. Suddenly he felt much more better, thanks to his idiot hedgehog.\u00a0</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"542\" data-orig-width=\"399\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/785f5830cd10e451280c680773eb79c2/tumblr_inline_prfpzoeV1s1rl818h_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"542\" data-orig-width=\"399\"/></figure><p><br/></p><p>His classes ended around 15:35, so he just packed up his stuff and made his way towards the gate, waiting for Lucas there. He obviously apologized to Alex when he went to the next class after the one he skipped. The boy was a bit confused, but didn\u2019t ask anything, but reassured him that he is not mad at all. Eliott felt even more guilty, since it would be easier to have him angry than being understanding, cause now he felt like shit for being mad at the guy.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHey\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>He nearly dropped his phone that he was staring at since long minutes now when he heard the voice behind him. He quickly slid it into his back pocket, turning around to see Lucas standing behind him with a smug smile on his face. Eliott had to swallow, because he just looked so fucking handsome with his disheveled hair, piercing blue eyes and that fucking grey scarf wrapped around his neck.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHey\u201d he gasped after getting over the waves of emotions he got just by seeing the short boy in front of him.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSo, we\u2019re going to your place?\u201d he asked, raising his eyebrows almost in a playful way.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cYeah, of course.\u201d he mumbled, still shocked by the other\u2019s behavior. He knew that Lucas was a flirtatious little shit, but to be like this face to face too was kind of shocking. Especially since he was supposed to be a closeted gay person.\u00a0<br/></p><p>Eliott took a deep breath now, walking to the bus stop with the short boy behind him. They weren\u2019t talking much and it was still relaxing. Just the fact that Lucas was there next to him was so soothing and calming that they needed no words to be said. The bus came rather quickly, so they got in and took the ride to Eliott\u2019s place. The apartment wasn\u2019t too far from the stop and they still haven\u2019t talked to each other.\u00a0</p><p>When they were upstairs, he unlocked the door, opening it and holding it while Lucas walked inside too. After he closed, he took off his bag and his jacket too, putting it on the rack next to the door. He waited for the boy to do the same, leaving his backpack under the jackets and he lead their way into the messy living room. He was just slightly embarrassed by the crumpled papers, empty bottles and pens laying all around on the ground.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThis place is a mess.\u201d Lucas stated after looking around and Eliott could feel his cheeks heating up in shame.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cYeah, I wasn\u2019t really in the mood to clean up last night.\u201d he mumbled, walking past the short boy to throw out the papers and take the bottles to the kitchen.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine, I usually have a bigger mess in my room.\u201d he said with a soft smile and like he\u2019s being home, flopped down on the couch, making himself comfortable. Eliott had to suppress a victorious smile, since he still had to redeem himself to the other.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cSo, you want a beer?\u201d he asked from the kitchen, raising his voice a little, so the boy can hear him clearly.<br/></p><p>\u201cYeah, sounds good.\u201d Lucas responded, so he grabbed two bottles of beer from the fridge walking back to the living room. He opened them using his lighter, just catching an impressed look on the boy\u2019s face before it disappeared. He handed him the beer and held his own, sitting down in the armchair across from the other.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re living here alone?\u201d he asked after long minutes of silence, taking a sip of his beer.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cWell, I have Nagini, but basically yes.\u201d he replied with a soft smile. It was nice to have a regular conversation with the boy.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cOh yeah, the snake.\u201d Lucas mumbled, gulping down the rest of his drink.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cIs there something wrong with my pet?\u201d Eliott raised an eyebrow.<br/></p><p>\u201cNo&hellip; well, I\u2019m not really a fan of reptiles, to be honest.\u201d he admitted and leant back on the couch, looking at the ceiling. He looked beaitful like this, his neck finally not covered by a scarf, revealing a mole close to the neck of his shirt. He wanted to kiss it so badly, but he tried to bury these feelings for now.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, he\u2019s not wandering around in the apartment or something.\u201d he joked, his face lighting up when a soft smile appeared on Lucas\u2019 face.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cJerk.\u201d that was all he said and he continued to stare at the ceiling.\u00a0<br/></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"607\" data-orig-width=\"399\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/58ae10ed6882fae51dea8db02c3e7356/tumblr_inline_prgq9jbisJ1rl818h_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"607\" data-orig-width=\"399\"/></figure><p>A few hours later they were in a much better mood, hence they had smoked two joints and drank three bottles of beer. Eliott was laying on the floor, legs pulled up so he could rest his sketchbook on his thighs as he was drawing. Meanwhile Lucas claimed the sofa to himself, head on the armrest while he legs pulled up enough so he can fit completely on the furniture. He was humming some melody that was stuck in his head while drumming on his legs. Eliott liked this a lot, it calmed him as he listened to the short boy.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s getting late.\u201d Eliott mumbled when he finished drawing and looked at his phone. It was 20:15 already, they were together since four hours now. It was so unbelieveable, since for him it seemed like an hour or even less.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cMika is going to kill me.\u201d Lucas sighed and glanced at the other boy, not even making an effort to get up from the couch.\u00a0\u201cAnd tomorrow is school.\u201d he groaned and stretched his legs out.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cYeah, your phone won\u2019t stop buzzing since you posted that picture.\u201d he chuckled, looking at the coffee table not far from his head, still laying on the floor. Both of their phones were there, since like an hour now when they decided they need some peace and quiet.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cI should not post on instagram while being high.\u201d he muttered and turned to his side, watching the tall one.\u00a0\u201cI have to answer a shit ton of questions now.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cLike who is that hot dude on your insta?\u201d he asked with a wide smirk on his face.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cShut up, Eli!\u201d he grumbled and got up from the sofa finally, stretching his body with a few moves, then looking down at the tall one, who was still on the floor.\u00a0\u201cGet up your ass and walk me out!\u201d he demanded with a serious look on his face which made Eliott laugh. He slowly pushed himself up and put his sketchbook on the coffee table, watching Lucas pocketing his phone. They walked to the door silently. The short one put on his jacket and then grabbed his backpack. Eliott opened the door for him and he kapt standing there as he walked out, turning back to face him.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWell, take care on your way home.\u201d the tall one said after a whole minute of intense staring at each other.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cYeah, thanks for this.\u201d he said with a genuine smile on his face.<br/></p><p>\u201cNo big deal. Text me when you got home, yeah?\u201d he asked softly and had to suppress a giggle when the short boy rolled his eyes.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cStop being like this.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cFine. See you at school tomorrow?\u201d he tilted his head, flashing a charming smile towards the boy, enjoying his returned confidence. It was still making him nervous being so close to someone he was crushing on since a while now, but the alcohol and weed combo inside him helped a lot to push that down.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cSure, I think the girls will have questions to both of us.\u201d he sighed, but a smug smile appeared on his face, like he enjoyed the situation.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cWell, we are just two buds, hanging out after school, right?\u201d he winked playfully which made the short one laugh.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cOkay, good night, Eliott.\u201d he said and started to walk towards the stairs.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cGood night, Lucas.\u201d he muttered and walked back inside, closing the door and then leaning his back to it. His face hurt from the huge grin he had on it, but he couldn\u2019t care less. He spent hours together with Lucas, he posted a picture of him on his instagram and it was just so perfect.\u00a0<br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><hr><p><i>Okay guys, this is really going to be a soft love story of two idiots!

He put it on the coffee table right after posting that selfie on insta and didn\u2019t dare to touch it ever since. He was afraid of Lucas\u2019 reaction. He saw that he commented and sent him a few messages in their chat, but he just couldn\u2019t check it. It was only one week, not more than that and the boy would probably understand his reasons, but it was still scary. What if Lucas never wants to speak to him again? What if he <b>does</b> what to speak to him again? How they should act around each other in school now? Should he avoid Lucas? Will Lucas avoid him? All these questions flooded his mind at the same time and he felt like drowning.</p><p>He wanted to call Idriss or Sofiane, but for that he would have to touch his phone and if he does, he won\u2019t be able to keep himself away from <b>the</b> app. So instead he put on some music, looking through his vinyl collection, finding some Harry Potter soundtrack be his best distraction. He also collected his pet snake to be his company while he suffers on the couch. He let him to wrap itself around his arm, just chilling there quietly, while he leant back, lighting a rolled cigarette.</p><p>It was around midnight when he ran out of tobacco, so he couldn\u2019t smoke anymore, plus the record ended like hours ago, only making some scratchy noises that filled the air. Nagi wandered up from his arm to his shoulders, rolling into a spiral, sleeping peacefully. He got startled when his phone buzzed on the coffee table. He made sure his pet is not falling off his shoulder as he leant forward to grab it, checking the notifications finally.\u00a0</p><p>He had messages from Sofiane, Idriss, Imane and most importantly Lucas. It took him a few minutes to prepare himself. He was still afraid, but he couldn\u2019t avoid things any longer. First he checked the comment under his photo. Okay, it wasn\u2019t that bad. Then he went to his DMs, opening his chat with the boy.</p><p><b>lucallemant</b><br>Are you for real?\u00a0<br>How could you be such a dick?!\u00a0<br>We met TWICE and you said nothing?\u00a0<br>Answer me, for fucks sake!\u00a0<br>Eli<br>Fuck, say something, Eliott!\u00a0<br>You said you can explain, then EXPLAIN<br>Okay, I\u2019m done, going to sleep\u00a0<br></p><p>Eliott sighed and rubbed his palm on his face a couple time, cursing under his breath. He was such an idiot for being so scared that he didn\u2019t answer him right away. But this wasn\u2019t making him feel better, because he still had no idea how he should be acting around Lucas in school. Should he approach him and talk about this in person or just avoid him and smooth things out in text? He got up from the couch, pocketing his phone, taking Nagini back to his terrarium, After that he decided to take a quick shower and going to sleep himself too.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>As he walked into the school building, he felt his palms getting sweaty as he was holding onto the straps of his backpack. He was nervous and fucking paranoid, feeling like Lucas could walk up to him at anytime, slapping him on the face and yell at him. Even though that didn\u2019t happen, he still couldn\u2019t relax and he hated himself for not being able to respond to those messages, but he had no idea what could be the best answer. He got startled when someone touched his shoulder, spinning around faster than a tornado, letting out a sigh when he noticed that it\u2019s just Alex.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay, bro? You look like you\u2019re going to pass out.\u201d he asked with concern in his voice. Eliott sighed again and messed up his hair a little in frustration.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cNot really. I haven\u2019t slept much.\u201d he answered honestly.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYeah, you look like a vampire.\u201d he laughed a little and squeezed his shoulder gently.\u00a0\u201cWill you be okay?\u201d he asked curiously. Eliott wanted to answer, reassuring him that he had much worse nights before when a voice interrupted them, coming from behind Alex.<br></p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t be okay after I finished with him.\u201d the voice was serious and mad, so so mad. Eliott felt his stomach churning as his friend stepped to the side, revealing a really angry looking Lucas, arms crossed in front of his chest, hair looking like he had an argument with a fan and his eyes, those beautiful blue eyes now looked like frozen water, cold and hard.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know you two knew each other.\u201d Alex said surprised, not understanding the short one\u2019s grumpiness.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWe do, but can you leave us alone now, Alex? Please.\u201d his voice got softer as he talked to the other boy and Eliott felt just a tiny bit of jealousy because of it. He wanted Lucas to talk to him like that, to not be angry, but be happy, soft and flirty.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cSure. See you on class, Eliott.\u201d he said, shooting an apologetic smile and walked away. It was obvious that he knew it\u2019s better not to piss off Lucas even more, but he was also afraid of what\u2019s going to happen to his classmate. Eliott let out a sigh, eyes fixed on the short boy\u2019s face.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cHey, Lucas.\u201d He mumbled, regretting the moment he said it, because he could basically see the boy in front of him flaming up. He remembered that moment of Hades from Hercules when he goes full red in anger. Lucas seemed to be not far from looking like that.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI so wanna punch you in the face right now.\u201d he huffed, looking at him with sparkling anger in his eyes.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWell, you did just that with a door yesterday.\u201d he said with a weak smile on his face, trying to light up the mood somehow.<br></p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare.\u201d Lucas said, raising up his finger.\u00a0\u201cDon\u2019t you dare bringing up yesterday. I swear to god\u2026.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, okay.\u201d he sighed, scratching the back of his neck now.\u00a0\u201cI was staring at my phone for hours, being afraid of your reaction.\u201d he mumbled honestly and looked at the ceiling.\u00a0\u201cI knew that you\u2019ll be mad\u2026 but I couldn\u2019t bring myself to tell you sooner.\u201d he explained, but when he brought his eyes back to the boy\u2019s face, it wasn\u2019t pure anger anymore, but combined with some confusion.<br></p><p>\u201cWait, you think I am mad because you are who you are?\u201d he asked raising his eyebrows, Eliott felt confused for a minute too.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d it was more of a question than a statement.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cAre you serious?\u201d he looked at him like Eliott just said that he\u2019s going to be the next presient or something.\u00a0\u201cI am fucking mad because you ignored me.\u201d he said seriously, still looking angry.\u00a0\u201cYeah, it shocked me when you revealed that fucking handsome face of yours, but I get it why you didn\u2019t tell me sooner.\u201d he sighed, rubbing his hands on his face now in frustration.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cDid you just call me handsome?\u201d Eliott asked, not believeing his ears anymore.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d the short boy said with a face that it\u2019s supposed to be obvious information. The tall one could feel the butterflies raising in his stomach, making him feel weird things now.\u00a0\u201cFuck, you are such an idiot.\u201d he continued, running his fingers through his hair, making even bigger of a mess out of it.\u00a0\u201cI barely slept because of you.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWell, same here.\u201d Eliott sighed now and leaned back to the lockers behind him. His heart skipped a beat when a tiny smile appeared on Lucas\u2019 face.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cAsshole.\u201d he huffed and sighed.\u00a0\u201cYou are just a pain in the ass, I hope you know that.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYou always make sure that I don\u2019t forget it.\u201d Eliott responded with a wide smile, to which the short boy rolled his eyes.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still mad at you.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI know that.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cTalk later?\u201d he asked, voice chill now and maybe even a bit playful. Eliott couldn\u2019t believe he was so calm and flirty all of the sudden.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d he muttered and watched the boy walking away. He needed a few minutes to collect his thoughts and register the things that just happened between the two of them. He reached for his phone in his pocket, opening instagram to send a text.\u00a0<br></p><p><b>srodulv</b><br>I\u2019m sorry, really</p><p>The reply was basically immediate and Eliott could feel his body tense up as he read it.</p><p><b>lucallemant</b><br>It\u2019s okay<br></p><p><b>srodulv</b><br>See you after school?</p><p><b>lucallemant</b><br>I\u2019ll check my calendar\u00a0</p><p><b>srodulv</b><br>Very funny<br></p><p><b>lucallemant</b><br>My humor is superior\u00a0</p><p><b>srodulv</b><br>So, will you let me make this up to you?\u00a0</p><p><b>lucallemant</b><br>Maybe\u2026\u00a0</p><p><b>srodulv</b><br>At my place, some beer and a joint?\u00a0</p><p><b>lucallemant</b><br>Fine\u00a0</p><p><b>srodulv</b><br>Meet me at the gate after classes\u00a0</p><p><b>lucallemant</b><br>I hate you\u00a0</p><p><b>srodulv</b><br>No you don\u2019t\u00a0\n\n\u2764\ufe0f\n\n</p><p>He was smiling at his phone like an idiot, then he walked to his classes. Alex obviously noticed that he was in a much better mood, but wasn\u2019t asking any questions, which Eliott appreciated a lot. But he mentioned a party that he\u2019s going to host this friday. He asked him if he would like to go and of course Eliott agreed to it. Nothing is better to get himself into the school life than attending to parties.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>He was having lunch with Alex and some of the boy\u2019s friends. He tried to join the conversation, but he kept getting distracted by a certain group of boys sitting a few tables away from them. They were way too loud, especially the curly haired one, Basile if he remembers correctly. The worst thing is that Lucas was sitting right across him, so he had a clear view on his face. And damn if he wasn\u2019t the most beautiful human being around. He looked so carefree and beautiful as he laughed at something his friend was rambling about. He got stratled out of his daze when someone snapped his fingers in front of his face. He looked at Alex confused.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI asked you a question, Sherlock.\u201d he said rolling his eyes.\u00a0\u201cWill you bring your crush to the party?\u201d he asked with a playful smirk on his face. The others were talking about a different subject, not paying attention to the two of them, which Eliott was grateful for.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI think he will be there. I don\u2019t know.\u201d he shrugged now, eating some of the parta that was laying untouched in front of him since ten minutes now.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cIs it Lucas?\u201d he asked now, being too impatient with his friend\u2019s mysteriousness and the tall boy could understand him, but he also would rather not talk about this, not until he smooth things out with his little hedgehog.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t wanna talk about it.\u201d he muttered after a minute of silence.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYou guys had a fight?\u201d he continued the asking and it slowly started to get on Eliott\u2019s nerves. He didn\u2019t like it when people were nosy around him or tried to get into his personal life without his consent. He could feel the anger inside him build up, so he grabbed his tray from the table and got up.<br></p><p>\u201cGotta go.\u201d that was the only thing he said before he stormed out of the cafeteria, leaving the tray on the shelf by the entrance.\u00a0<br></p><p>He made his way to one of the bathrooms and locked himself in a stall, sitting up on the toilet, legs pulled up to his chest. This was just so unnecessary, but he couldn\u2019t control his own emotions. His whole day was a fucking ride on a rollercoaster and usually that was when his illness liked to kick in. He also forgot to take his medicines last night, which was also making things worse than they already were. He decided to skip the next class, trying to avoid a possible freakout in front of everyone.\u00a0</p><p>He sighed when he felt his phone buzzing in his pocket. He really hoped that it\u2019s not Alex, because he had no idea what kind of excuse he could make up to his sudden leave. He tried to avoid letting anyone know about his mental health and his struggles. It\u2019s easier to let people think that you are an asshole rather than they think you are crazy or look at you with pity. He fished the device out of his pocket and checked his notifications.\u00a0</p><p><b>lucallemant</b><br>Are you okay?\u00a0<br>I saw you storming out of the cafeteria</p><p><b>srodulv</b><br>I\u2019ll be fine\u00a0</p><p>He looked at the ceiling and let the feeling of warmth spread in his chest. How fucking lucky he was to have someone in his life like Lucas. Even if he was mad at him, he was still worried, trying to reach out when he saw that Eliott was not feeling okay.\u00a0</p><p><b>lucallemant</b><br>You need me to go there?\u00a0<br>Where are you?\u00a0</p><p><b>srodulv</b><br>In the bathroom\u00a0<br>And no, stay with your friends</p><p><b>lucallemant</b><br>You are my friend too\u00a0</p><p><b>srodulv</b><br>Ouch, straight up to the friendzone?\u00a0<br>You have no mercy</p><p><b>lucallemant</b><br>Fuck you\u00a0</p><p><b>srodulv\u00a0</b><br>\n\n\u2764\ufe0f\n<br></p><p><b>lucallemant</b><br>But seriously<br>I can go there if you want</p><p><b>srodulv</b><br>I kinda wanna be alone right now</p><p><b>lucallemant</b><br>Do you want me to stop with the texts?\u00a0</p><p><b>srodulv</b><br>No, that\u2019s fine\u00a0<br>You are kinda my safe place anyways</p><p><b>lucallemant</b><br>I\u2019m still mad at you, just so you know\u00a0</p><p><b>srodulv</b><br>I know and I\u2019m sorry\u00a0</p><p><b>lucallemant</b><br>Stop apologizing\u00a0<br>You\u2019re being annoying</p><p><b>srodulv</b><br>Yeah, breaking news</p><p><b>lucallemant</b><br>Gotta go to class soon<br>Text me if you need anything, yeah?\u00a0</p><p><b>srodulv</b><br>Don\u2019t worry, mom<br>I will be fine\u00a0</p><p><b>lucallemant</b><br>Did you just momzoned me?\u00a0<br>You ass\u00a0</p><p><b>srodulv</b><br>Go to class, Lucas\u00a0\n\n\u2764\ufe0f\n\n</p><p><b>lucallemant</b><br>Have fun in the toilet\u00a0\n\n\u2764\ufe0f\n\n</p><p>Eliott giggled just a little, but then he noticed that Lucas also posted a picture on insta. When he saw it, his heart started to beat faster, huge grin appearing on his face. Suddenly he felt much more better, thanks to his idiot hedgehog.\u00a0</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"542\" data-orig-width=\"399\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/785f5830cd10e451280c680773eb79c2/tumblr_inline_prfpzoeV1s1rl818h_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"542\" data-orig-width=\"399\"></figure><p><br></p><p>His classes ended around 15:35, so he just packed up his stuff and made his way towards the gate, waiting for Lucas there. He obviously apologized to Alex when he went to the next class after the one he skipped. The boy was a bit confused, but didn\u2019t ask anything, but reassured him that he is not mad at all. Eliott felt even more guilty, since it would be easier to have him angry than being understanding, cause now he felt like shit for being mad at the guy.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHey\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>He nearly dropped his phone that he was staring at since long minutes now when he heard the voice behind him. He quickly slid it into his back pocket, turning around to see Lucas standing behind him with a smug smile on his face. Eliott had to swallow, because he just looked so fucking handsome with his disheveled hair, piercing blue eyes and that fucking grey scarf wrapped around his neck.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHey\u201d he gasped after getting over the waves of emotions he got just by seeing the short boy in front of him.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSo, we\u2019re going to your place?\u201d he asked, raising his eyebrows almost in a playful way.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYeah, of course.\u201d he mumbled, still shocked by the other\u2019s behavior. He knew that Lucas was a flirtatious little shit, but to be like this face to face too was kind of shocking. Especially since he was supposed to be a closeted gay person.\u00a0<br></p><p>Eliott took a deep breath now, walking to the bus stop with the short boy behind him. They weren\u2019t talking much and it was still relaxing. Just the fact that Lucas was there next to him was so soothing and calming that they needed no words to be said. The bus came rather quickly, so they got in and took the ride to Eliott\u2019s place. The apartment wasn\u2019t too far from the stop and they still haven\u2019t talked to each other.\u00a0</p><p>When they were upstairs, he unlocked the door, opening it and holding it while Lucas walked inside too. After he closed, he took off his bag and his jacket too, putting it on the rack next to the door. He waited for the boy to do the same, leaving his backpack under the jackets and he lead their way into the messy living room. He was just slightly embarrassed by the crumpled papers, empty bottles and pens laying all around on the ground.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThis place is a mess.\u201d Lucas stated after looking around and Eliott could feel his cheeks heating up in shame.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYeah, I wasn\u2019t really in the mood to clean up last night.\u201d he mumbled, walking past the short boy to throw out the papers and take the bottles to the kitchen.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine, I usually have a bigger mess in my room.\u201d he said with a soft smile and like he\u2019s being home, flopped down on the couch, making himself comfortable. Eliott had to suppress a victorious smile, since he still had to redeem himself to the other.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cSo, you want a beer?\u201d he asked from the kitchen, raising his voice a little, so the boy can hear him clearly.<br></p><p>\u201cYeah, sounds good.\u201d Lucas responded, so he grabbed two bottles of beer from the fridge walking back to the living room. He opened them using his lighter, just catching an impressed look on the boy\u2019s face before it disappeared. He handed him the beer and held his own, sitting down in the armchair across from the other.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re living here alone?\u201d he asked after long minutes of silence, taking a sip of his beer.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWell, I have Nagini, but basically yes.\u201d he replied with a soft smile. It was nice to have a regular conversation with the boy.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cOh yeah, the snake.\u201d Lucas mumbled, gulping down the rest of his drink.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cIs there something wrong with my pet?\u201d Eliott raised an eyebrow.<br></p><p>\u201cNo\u2026 well, I\u2019m not really a fan of reptiles, to be honest.\u201d he admitted and leant back on the couch, looking at the ceiling. He looked beaitful like this, his neck finally not covered by a scarf, revealing a mole close to the neck of his shirt. He wanted to kiss it so badly, but he tried to bury these feelings for now.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, he\u2019s not wandering around in the apartment or something.\u201d he joked, his face lighting up when a soft smile appeared on Lucas\u2019 face.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cJerk.\u201d that was all he said and he continued to stare at the ceiling.\u00a0<br></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"607\" data-orig-width=\"399\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/58ae10ed6882fae51dea8db02c3e7356/tumblr_inline_prgq9jbisJ1rl818h_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"607\" data-orig-width=\"399\"></figure><p>A few hours later they were in a much better mood, hence they had smoked two joints and drank three bottles of beer. Eliott was laying on the floor, legs pulled up so he could rest his sketchbook on his thighs as he was drawing. Meanwhile Lucas claimed the sofa to himself, head on the armrest while he legs pulled up enough so he can fit completely on the furniture. He was humming some melody that was stuck in his head while drumming on his legs. Eliott liked this a lot, it calmed him as he listened to the short boy.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s getting late.\u201d Eliott mumbled when he finished drawing and looked at his phone. It was 20:15 already, they were together since four hours now. It was so unbelieveable, since for him it seemed like an hour or even less.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cMika is going to kill me.\u201d Lucas sighed and glanced at the other boy, not even making an effort to get up from the couch.\u00a0\u201cAnd tomorrow is school.\u201d he groaned and stretched his legs out.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYeah, your phone won\u2019t stop buzzing since you posted that picture.\u201d he chuckled, looking at the coffee table not far from his head, still laying on the floor. Both of their phones were there, since like an hour now when they decided they need some peace and quiet.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI should not post on instagram while being high.\u201d he muttered and turned to his side, watching the tall one.\u00a0\u201cI have to answer a shit ton of questions now.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cLike who is that hot dude on your insta?\u201d he asked with a wide smirk on his face.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cShut up, Eli!\u201d he grumbled and got up from the sofa finally, stretching his body with a few moves, then looking down at the tall one, who was still on the floor.\u00a0\u201cGet up your ass and walk me out!\u201d he demanded with a serious look on his face which made Eliott laugh. He slowly pushed himself up and put his sketchbook on the coffee table, watching Lucas pocketing his phone. They walked to the door silently. The short one put on his jacket and then grabbed his backpack. Eliott opened the door for him and he kapt standing there as he walked out, turning back to face him.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWell, take care on your way home.\u201d the tall one said after a whole minute of intense staring at each other.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYeah, thanks for this.\u201d he said with a genuine smile on his face.<br></p><p>\u201cNo big deal. Text me when you got home, yeah?\u201d he asked softly and had to suppress a giggle when the short boy rolled his eyes.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cStop being like this.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cFine. See you at school tomorrow?\u201d he tilted his head, flashing a charming smile towards the boy, enjoying his returned confidence. It was still making him nervous being so close to someone he was crushing on since a while now, but the alcohol and weed combo inside him helped a lot to push that down.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cSure, I think the girls will have questions to both of us.\u201d he sighed, but a smug smile appeared on his face, like he enjoyed the situation.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWell, we are just two buds, hanging out after school, right?\u201d he winked playfully which made the short one laugh.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cOkay, good night, Eliott.\u201d he said and started to walk towards the stairs.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cGood night, Lucas.\u201d he muttered and walked back inside, closing the door and then leaning his back to it. His face hurt from the huge grin he had on it, but he couldn\u2019t care less. He spent hours together with Lucas, he posted a picture of him on his instagram and it was just so perfect.\u00a0<br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><hr><p><i>Okay guys, this is really going to be a soft love story of two idiots!

They get along well and it\u2019s just a safe place for him to go back to when things are getting too much in his life. But january is here and he\u2019s about to start at his new school. What he doesn\u2019t expect is to bump into the person he\u2019s been texting with. Suddenly Eliott\u2019s life going upside down as he both tries to approach and avoid Lucas at the same time. </b></p>[[MORE]]<hr><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><h2><b>Beers and joints</b></h2><p><br></p><p>Eliott was staring at his phone since hours now. He put it on the coffee table right after posting that selfie on insta and didn\u2019t dare to touch it ever since. He was afraid of Lucas\u2019 reaction. He saw that he commented and sent him a few messages in their chat, but he just couldn\u2019t check it. It was only one week, not more than that and the boy would probably understand his reasons, but it was still scary. What if Lucas never wants to speak to him again? What if he <b>does</b> what to speak to him again? How they should act around each other in school now? Should he avoid Lucas? Will Lucas avoid him? All these questions flooded his mind at the same time and he felt like drowning.</p><p>He wanted to call Idriss or Sofiane, but for that he would have to touch his phone and if he does, he won\u2019t be able to keep himself away from <b>the</b> app. So instead he put on some music, looking through his vinyl collection, finding some Harry Potter soundtrack be his best distraction. He also collected his pet snake to be his company while he suffers on the couch. He let him to wrap itself around his arm, just chilling there quietly, while he leant back, lighting a rolled cigarette.</p><p>It was around midnight when he ran out of tobacco, so he couldn\u2019t smoke anymore, plus the record ended like hours ago, only making some scratchy noises that filled the air. Nagi wandered up from his arm to his shoulders, rolling into a spiral, sleeping peacefully. He got startled when his phone buzzed on the coffee table. He made sure his pet is not falling off his shoulder as he leant forward to grab it, checking the notifications finally.\u00a0</p><p>He had messages from Sofiane, Idriss, Imane and most importantly Lucas. It took him a few minutes to prepare himself. He was still afraid, but he couldn\u2019t avoid things any longer. First he checked the comment under his photo. Okay, it wasn\u2019t that bad. Then he went to his DMs, opening his chat with the boy.</p><p><b>lucallemant</b><br>Are you for real?\u00a0<br>How could you be such a dick?!\u00a0<br>We met TWICE and you said nothing?\u00a0<br>Answer me, for fucks sake!\u00a0<br>Eli<br>Fuck, say something, Eliott!\u00a0<br>You said you can explain, then EXPLAIN<br>Okay, I\u2019m done, going to sleep\u00a0<br></p><p>Eliott sighed and rubbed his palm on his face a couple time, cursing under his breath. He was such an idiot for being so scared that he didn\u2019t answer him right away. But this wasn\u2019t making him feel better, because he still had no idea how he should be acting around Lucas in school. Should he approach him and talk about this in person or just avoid him and smooth things out in text? He got up from the couch, pocketing his phone, taking Nagini back to his terrarium, After that he decided to take a quick shower and going to sleep himself too.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>As he walked into the school building, he felt his palms getting sweaty as he was holding onto the straps of his backpack. He was nervous and fucking paranoid, feeling like Lucas could walk up to him at anytime, slapping him on the face and yell at him. Even though that didn\u2019t happen, he still couldn\u2019t relax and he hated himself for not being able to respond to those messages, but he had no idea what could be the best answer. He got startled when someone touched his shoulder, spinning around faster than a tornado, letting out a sigh when he noticed that it\u2019s just Alex.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay, bro? You look like you\u2019re going to pass out.\u201d he asked with concern in his voice. Eliott sighed again and messed up his hair a little in frustration.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cNot really. I haven\u2019t slept much.\u201d he answered honestly.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYeah, you look like a vampire.\u201d he laughed a little and squeezed his shoulder gently.\u00a0\u201cWill you be okay?\u201d he asked curiously. Eliott wanted to answer, reassuring him that he had much worse nights before when a voice interrupted them, coming from behind Alex.<br></p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t be okay after I finished with him.\u201d the voice was serious and mad, so so mad. Eliott felt his stomach churning as his friend stepped to the side, revealing a really angry looking Lucas, arms crossed in front of his chest, hair looking like he had an argument with a fan and his eyes, those beautiful blue eyes now looked like frozen water, cold and hard.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know you two knew each other.\u201d Alex said surprised, not understanding the short one\u2019s grumpiness.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWe do, but can you leave us alone now, Alex? Please.\u201d his voice got softer as he talked to the other boy and Eliott felt just a tiny bit of jealousy because of it. He wanted Lucas to talk to him like that, to not be angry, but be happy, soft and flirty.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cSure. See you on class, Eliott.\u201d he said, shooting an apologetic smile and walked away. It was obvious that he knew it\u2019s better not to piss off Lucas even more, but he was also afraid of what\u2019s going to happen to his classmate. Eliott let out a sigh, eyes fixed on the short boy\u2019s face.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cHey, Lucas.\u201d He mumbled, regretting the moment he said it, because he could basically see the boy in front of him flaming up. He remembered that moment of Hades from Hercules when he goes full red in anger. Lucas seemed to be not far from looking like that.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI so wanna punch you in the face right now.\u201d he huffed, looking at him with sparkling anger in his eyes.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWell, you did just that with a door yesterday.\u201d he said with a weak smile on his face, trying to light up the mood somehow.<br></p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare.\u201d Lucas said, raising up his finger.\u00a0\u201cDon\u2019t you dare bringing up yesterday. I swear to god\u2026.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, okay.\u201d he sighed, scratching the back of his neck now.\u00a0\u201cI was staring at my phone for hours, being afraid of your reaction.\u201d he mumbled honestly and looked at the ceiling.\u00a0\u201cI knew that you\u2019ll be mad\u2026 but I couldn\u2019t bring myself to tell you sooner.\u201d he explained, but when he brought his eyes back to the boy\u2019s face, it wasn\u2019t pure anger anymore, but combined with some confusion.<br></p><p>\u201cWait, you think I am mad because you are who you are?\u201d he asked raising his eyebrows, Eliott felt confused for a minute too.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d it was more of a question than a statement.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cAre you serious?\u201d he looked at him like Eliott just said that he\u2019s going to be the next presient or something.\u00a0\u201cI am fucking mad because you ignored me.\u201d he said seriously, still looking angry.\u00a0\u201cYeah, it shocked me when you revealed that fucking handsome face of yours, but I get it why you didn\u2019t tell me sooner.\u201d he sighed, rubbing his hands on his face now in frustration.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cDid you just call me handsome?\u201d Eliott asked, not believeing his ears anymore.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d the short boy said with a face that it\u2019s supposed to be obvious information. The tall one could feel the butterflies raising in his stomach, making him feel weird things now.\u00a0\u201cFuck, you are such an idiot.\u201d he continued, running his fingers through his hair, making even bigger of a mess out of it.\u00a0\u201cI barely slept because of you.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWell, same here.\u201d Eliott sighed now and leaned back to the lockers behind him. His heart skipped a beat when a tiny smile appeared on Lucas\u2019 face.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cAsshole.\u201d he huffed and sighed.\u00a0\u201cYou are just a pain in the ass, I hope you know that.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYou always make sure that I don\u2019t forget it.\u201d Eliott responded with a wide smile, to which the short boy rolled his eyes.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still mad at you.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI know that.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cTalk later?\u201d he asked, voice chill now and maybe even a bit playful. Eliott couldn\u2019t believe he was so calm and flirty all of the sudden.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d he muttered and watched the boy walking away. He needed a few minutes to collect his thoughts and register the things that just happened between the two of them. He reached for his phone in his pocket, opening instagram to send a text.\u00a0<br></p><p><b>srodulv</b><br>I\u2019m sorry, really</p><p>The reply was basically immediate and Eliott could feel his body tense up as he read it.</p><p><b>lucallemant</b><br>It\u2019s okay<br></p><p><b>srodulv</b><br>See you after school?</p><p><b>lucallemant</b><br>I\u2019ll check my calendar\u00a0</p><p><b>srodulv</b><br>Very funny<br></p><p><b>lucallemant</b><br>My humor is superior\u00a0</p><p><b>srodulv</b><br>So, will you let me make this up to you?\u00a0</p><p><b>lucallemant</b><br>Maybe\u2026\u00a0</p><p><b>srodulv</b><br>At my place, some beer and a joint?\u00a0</p><p><b>lucallemant</b><br>Fine\u00a0</p><p><b>srodulv</b><br>Meet me at the gate after classes\u00a0</p><p><b>lucallemant</b><br>I hate you\u00a0</p><p><b>srodulv</b><br>No you don\u2019t\u00a0\n\n\u2764\ufe0f\n\n</p><p>He was smiling at his phone like an idiot, then he walked to his classes. Alex obviously noticed that he was in a much better mood, but wasn\u2019t asking any questions, which Eliott appreciated a lot. But he mentioned a party that he\u2019s going to host this friday. He asked him if he would like to go and of course Eliott agreed to it. Nothing is better to get himself into the school life than attending to parties.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>He was having lunch with Alex and some of the boy\u2019s friends. He tried to join the conversation, but he kept getting distracted by a certain group of boys sitting a few tables away from them. They were way too loud, especially the curly haired one, Basile if he remembers correctly. The worst thing is that Lucas was sitting right across him, so he had a clear view on his face. And damn if he wasn\u2019t the most beautiful human being around. He looked so carefree and beautiful as he laughed at something his friend was rambling about. He got stratled out of his daze when someone snapped his fingers in front of his face. He looked at Alex confused.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI asked you a question, Sherlock.\u201d he said rolling his eyes.\u00a0\u201cWill you bring your crush to the party?\u201d he asked with a playful smirk on his face. The others were talking about a different subject, not paying attention to the two of them, which Eliott was grateful for.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI think he will be there. I don\u2019t know.\u201d he shrugged now, eating some of the parta that was laying untouched in front of him since ten minutes now.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cIs it Lucas?\u201d he asked now, being too impatient with his friend\u2019s mysteriousness and the tall boy could understand him, but he also would rather not talk about this, not until he smooth things out with his little hedgehog.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t wanna talk about it.\u201d he muttered after a minute of silence.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYou guys had a fight?\u201d he continued the asking and it slowly started to get on Eliott\u2019s nerves. He didn\u2019t like it when people were nosy around him or tried to get into his personal life without his consent. He could feel the anger inside him build up, so he grabbed his tray from the table and got up.<br></p><p>\u201cGotta go.\u201d that was the only thing he said before he stormed out of the cafeteria, leaving the tray on the shelf by the entrance.\u00a0<br></p><p>He made his way to one of the bathrooms and locked himself in a stall, sitting up on the toilet, legs pulled up to his chest. This was just so unnecessary, but he couldn\u2019t control his own emotions. His whole day was a fucking ride on a rollercoaster and usually that was when his illness liked to kick in. He also forgot to take his medicines last night, which was also making things worse than they already were. He decided to skip the next class, trying to avoid a possible freakout in front of everyone.\u00a0</p><p>He sighed when he felt his phone buzzing in his pocket. He really hoped that it\u2019s not Alex, because he had no idea what kind of excuse he could make up to his sudden leave. He tried to avoid letting anyone know about his mental health and his struggles. It\u2019s easier to let people think that you are an asshole rather than they think you are crazy or look at you with pity. He fished the device out of his pocket and checked his notifications.\u00a0</p><p><b>lucallemant</b><br>Are you okay?\u00a0<br>I saw you storming out of the cafeteria</p><p><b>srodulv</b><br>I\u2019ll be fine\u00a0</p><p>He looked at the ceiling and let the feeling of warmth spread in his chest. How fucking lucky he was to have someone in his life like Lucas. Even if he was mad at him, he was still worried, trying to reach out when he saw that Eliott was not feeling okay.\u00a0</p><p><b>lucallemant</b><br>You need me to go there?\u00a0<br>Where are you?\u00a0</p><p><b>srodulv</b><br>In the bathroom\u00a0<br>And no, stay with your friends</p><p><b>lucallemant</b><br>You are my friend too\u00a0</p><p><b>srodulv</b><br>Ouch, straight up to the friendzone?\u00a0<br>You have no mercy</p><p><b>lucallemant</b><br>Fuck you\u00a0</p><p><b>srodulv\u00a0</b><br>\n\n\u2764\ufe0f\n<br></p><p><b>lucallemant</b><br>But seriously<br>I can go there if you want</p><p><b>srodulv</b><br>I kinda wanna be alone right now</p><p><b>lucallemant</b><br>Do you want me to stop with the texts?\u00a0</p><p><b>srodulv</b><br>No, that\u2019s fine\u00a0<br>You are kinda my safe place anyways</p><p><b>lucallemant</b><br>I\u2019m still mad at you, just so you know\u00a0</p><p><b>srodulv</b><br>I know and I\u2019m sorry\u00a0</p><p><b>lucallemant</b><br>Stop apologizing\u00a0<br>You\u2019re being annoying</p><p><b>srodulv</b><br>Yeah, breaking news</p><p><b>lucallemant</b><br>Gotta go to class soon<br>Text me if you need anything, yeah?\u00a0</p><p><b>srodulv</b><br>Don\u2019t worry, mom<br>I will be fine\u00a0</p><p><b>lucallemant</b><br>Did you just momzoned me?\u00a0<br>You ass\u00a0</p><p><b>srodulv</b><br>Go to class, Lucas\u00a0\n\n\u2764\ufe0f\n\n</p><p><b>lucallemant</b><br>Have fun in the toilet\u00a0\n\n\u2764\ufe0f\n\n</p><p>Eliott giggled just a little, but then he noticed that Lucas also posted a picture on insta. When he saw it, his heart started to beat faster, huge grin appearing on his face. Suddenly he felt much more better, thanks to his idiot hedgehog.\u00a0</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"542\" data-orig-width=\"399\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/785f5830cd10e451280c680773eb79c2/tumblr_inline_prfpzoeV1s1rl818h_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"542\" data-orig-width=\"399\"></figure><p><br></p><p>His classes ended around 15:35, so he just packed up his stuff and made his way towards the gate, waiting for Lucas there. He obviously apologized to Alex when he went to the next class after the one he skipped. The boy was a bit confused, but didn\u2019t ask anything, but reassured him that he is not mad at all. Eliott felt even more guilty, since it would be easier to have him angry than being understanding, cause now he felt like shit for being mad at the guy.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHey\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>He nearly dropped his phone that he was staring at since long minutes now when he heard the voice behind him. He quickly slid it into his back pocket, turning around to see Lucas standing behind him with a smug smile on his face. Eliott had to swallow, because he just looked so fucking handsome with his disheveled hair, piercing blue eyes and that fucking grey scarf wrapped around his neck.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHey\u201d he gasped after getting over the waves of emotions he got just by seeing the short boy in front of him.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSo, we\u2019re going to your place?\u201d he asked, raising his eyebrows almost in a playful way.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYeah, of course.\u201d he mumbled, still shocked by the other\u2019s behavior. He knew that Lucas was a flirtatious little shit, but to be like this face to face too was kind of shocking. Especially since he was supposed to be a closeted gay person.\u00a0<br></p><p>Eliott took a deep breath now, walking to the bus stop with the short boy behind him. They weren\u2019t talking much and it was still relaxing. Just the fact that Lucas was there next to him was so soothing and calming that they needed no words to be said. The bus came rather quickly, so they got in and took the ride to Eliott\u2019s place. The apartment wasn\u2019t too far from the stop and they still haven\u2019t talked to each other.\u00a0</p><p>When they were upstairs, he unlocked the door, opening it and holding it while Lucas walked inside too. After he closed, he took off his bag and his jacket too, putting it on the rack next to the door. He waited for the boy to do the same, leaving his backpack under the jackets and he lead their way into the messy living room. He was just slightly embarrassed by the crumpled papers, empty bottles and pens laying all around on the ground.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThis place is a mess.\u201d Lucas stated after looking around and Eliott could feel his cheeks heating up in shame.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYeah, I wasn\u2019t really in the mood to clean up last night.\u201d he mumbled, walking past the short boy to throw out the papers and take the bottles to the kitchen.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine, I usually have a bigger mess in my room.\u201d he said with a soft smile and like he\u2019s being home, flopped down on the couch, making himself comfortable. Eliott had to suppress a victorious smile, since he still had to redeem himself to the other.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cSo, you want a beer?\u201d he asked from the kitchen, raising his voice a little, so the boy can hear him clearly.<br></p><p>\u201cYeah, sounds good.\u201d Lucas responded, so he grabbed two bottles of beer from the fridge walking back to the living room. He opened them using his lighter, just catching an impressed look on the boy\u2019s face before it disappeared. He handed him the beer and held his own, sitting down in the armchair across from the other.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re living here alone?\u201d he asked after long minutes of silence, taking a sip of his beer.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWell, I have Nagini, but basically yes.\u201d he replied with a soft smile. It was nice to have a regular conversation with the boy.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cOh yeah, the snake.\u201d Lucas mumbled, gulping down the rest of his drink.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cIs there something wrong with my pet?\u201d Eliott raised an eyebrow.<br></p><p>\u201cNo\u2026 well, I\u2019m not really a fan of reptiles, to be honest.\u201d he admitted and leant back on the couch, looking at the ceiling. He looked beaitful like this, his neck finally not covered by a scarf, revealing a mole close to the neck of his shirt. He wanted to kiss it so badly, but he tried to bury these feelings for now.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, he\u2019s not wandering around in the apartment or something.\u201d he joked, his face lighting up when a soft smile appeared on Lucas\u2019 face.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cJerk.\u201d that was all he said and he continued to stare at the ceiling.\u00a0<br></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"607\" data-orig-width=\"399\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/58ae10ed6882fae51dea8db02c3e7356/tumblr_inline_prgq9jbisJ1rl818h_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"607\" data-orig-width=\"399\"></figure><p>A few hours later they were in a much better mood, hence they had smoked two joints and drank three bottles of beer. Eliott was laying on the floor, legs pulled up so he could rest his sketchbook on his thighs as he was drawing. Meanwhile Lucas claimed the sofa to himself, head on the armrest while he legs pulled up enough so he can fit completely on the furniture. He was humming some melody that was stuck in his head while drumming on his legs. Eliott liked this a lot, it calmed him as he listened to the short boy.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s getting late.\u201d Eliott mumbled when he finished drawing and looked at his phone. It was 20:15 already, they were together since four hours now. It was so unbelieveable, since for him it seemed like an hour or even less.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cMika is going to kill me.\u201d Lucas sighed and glanced at the other boy, not even making an effort to get up from the couch.\u00a0\u201cAnd tomorrow is school.\u201d he groaned and stretched his legs out.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYeah, your phone won\u2019t stop buzzing since you posted that picture.\u201d he chuckled, looking at the coffee table not far from his head, still laying on the floor. Both of their phones were there, since like an hour now when they decided they need some peace and quiet.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI should not post on instagram while being high.\u201d he muttered and turned to his side, watching the tall one.\u00a0\u201cI have to answer a shit ton of questions now.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cLike who is that hot dude on your insta?\u201d he asked with a wide smirk on his face.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cShut up, Eli!\u201d he grumbled and got up from the sofa finally, stretching his body with a few moves, then looking down at the tall one, who was still on the floor.\u00a0\u201cGet up your ass and walk me out!\u201d he demanded with a serious look on his face which made Eliott laugh. He slowly pushed himself up and put his sketchbook on the coffee table, watching Lucas pocketing his phone. They walked to the door silently. The short one put on his jacket and then grabbed his backpack. Eliott opened the door for him and he kapt standing there as he walked out, turning back to face him.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWell, take care on your way home.\u201d the tall one said after a whole minute of intense staring at each other.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYeah, thanks for this.\u201d he said with a genuine smile on his face.<br></p><p>\u201cNo big deal. Text me when you got home, yeah?\u201d he asked softly and had to suppress a giggle when the short boy rolled his eyes.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cStop being like this.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cFine. See you at school tomorrow?\u201d he tilted his head, flashing a charming smile towards the boy, enjoying his returned confidence. It was still making him nervous being so close to someone he was crushing on since a while now, but the alcohol and weed combo inside him helped a lot to push that down.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cSure, I think the girls will have questions to both of us.\u201d he sighed, but a smug smile appeared on his face, like he enjoyed the situation.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWell, we are just two buds, hanging out after school, right?\u201d he winked playfully which made the short one laugh.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cOkay, good night, Eliott.\u201d he said and started to walk towards the stairs.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cGood night, Lucas.\u201d he muttered and walked back inside, closing the door and then leaning his back to it. His face hurt from the huge grin he had on it, but he couldn\u2019t care less. He spent hours together with Lucas, he posted a picture of him on his instagram and it was just so perfect.\u00a0<br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><hr><p><i>Okay guys, this is really going to be a soft love story of two idiots!

They get along well and it&rsquo;s just a safe place for him to go back to when things are getting too much in his life. But january is here and he&rsquo;s about to start at his new school. What he doesn&rsquo;t expect is to bump into the person he&rsquo;s been texting with. Suddenly Eliott&rsquo;s life going upside down as he both tries to approach and avoid Lucas at the same time. </b></p><hr /><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><h2><b>Beers and joints</b></h2><p><br /></p><p>Eliott was staring at his phone since hours now. He put it on the coffee table right after posting that selfie on insta and didn&rsquo;t dare to touch it ever since. He was afraid of Lucas&rsquo; reaction. He saw that he commented and sent him a few messages in their chat, but he just couldn&rsquo;t check it. It was only one week, not more than that and the boy would probably understand his reasons, but it was still scary. What if Lucas never wants to speak to him again? What if he <b>does</b> what to speak to him again? How they should act around each other in school now? Should he avoid Lucas? Will Lucas avoid him? All these questions flooded his mind at the same time and he felt like drowning.</p><p>He wanted to call Idriss or Sofiane, but for that he would have to touch his phone and if he does, he won&rsquo;t be able to keep himself away from <b>the</b> app. So instead he put on some music, looking through his vinyl collection, finding some Harry Potter soundtrack be his best distraction. He also collected his pet snake to be his company while he suffers on the couch. He let him to wrap itself around his arm, just chilling there quietly, while he leant back, lighting a rolled cigarette.</p><p>It was around midnight when he ran out of tobacco, so he couldn&rsquo;t smoke anymore, plus the record ended like hours ago, only making some scratchy noises that filled the air. Nagi wandered up from his arm to his shoulders, rolling into a spiral, sleeping peacefully. He got startled when his phone buzzed on the coffee table. He made sure his pet is not falling off his shoulder as he leant forward to grab it, checking the notifications finally.&nbsp;</p><p>He had messages from Sofiane, Idriss, Imane and most importantly Lucas. It took him a few minutes to prepare himself. He was still afraid, but he couldn&rsquo;t avoid things any longer. First he checked the comment under his photo. Okay, it wasn&rsquo;t that bad. Then he went to his DMs, opening his chat with the boy.</p><p><b>lucallemant</b><br />Are you for real?&nbsp;<br />How could you be such a dick?!&nbsp;<br />We met TWICE and you said nothing?&nbsp;<br />Answer me, for fucks sake!&nbsp;<br />Eli<br />Fuck, say something, Eliott!&nbsp;<br />You said you can explain, then EXPLAIN<br />Okay, I&rsquo;m done, going to sleep&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Eliott sighed and rubbed his palm on his face a couple time, cursing under his breath. He was such an idiot for being so scared that he didn&rsquo;t answer him right away. But this wasn&rsquo;t making him feel better, because he still had no idea how he should be acting around Lucas in school. Should he approach him and talk about this in person or just avoid him and smooth things out in text? He got up from the couch, pocketing his phone, taking Nagini back to his terrarium, After that he decided to take a quick shower and going to sleep himself too.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>As he walked into the school building, he felt his palms getting sweaty as he was holding onto the straps of his backpack. He was nervous and fucking paranoid, feeling like Lucas could walk up to him at anytime, slapping him on the face and yell at him. Even though that didn&rsquo;t happen, he still couldn&rsquo;t relax and he hated himself for not being able to respond to those messages, but he had no idea what could be the best answer. He got startled when someone touched his shoulder, spinning around faster than a tornado, letting out a sigh when he noticed that it&rsquo;s just Alex.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you okay, bro? You look like you&rsquo;re going to pass out.&rdquo; he asked with concern in his voice. Eliott sighed again and messed up his hair a little in frustration.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Not really. I haven&rsquo;t slept much.&rdquo; he answered honestly.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, you look like a vampire.&rdquo; he laughed a little and squeezed his shoulder gently.&nbsp;&ldquo;Will you be okay?&rdquo; he asked curiously. Eliott wanted to answer, reassuring him that he had much worse nights before when a voice interrupted them, coming from behind Alex.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;He won&rsquo;t be okay after I finished with him.&rdquo; the voice was serious and mad, so so mad. Eliott felt his stomach churning as his friend stepped to the side, revealing a really angry looking Lucas, arms crossed in front of his chest, hair looking like he had an argument with a fan and his eyes, those beautiful blue eyes now looked like frozen water, cold and hard.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know you two knew each other.&rdquo; Alex said surprised, not understanding the short one&rsquo;s grumpiness.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;We do, but can you leave us alone now, Alex? Please.&rdquo; his voice got softer as he talked to the other boy and Eliott felt just a tiny bit of jealousy because of it. He wanted Lucas to talk to him like that, to not be angry, but be happy, soft and flirty.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Sure. See you on class, Eliott.&rdquo; he said, shooting an apologetic smile and walked away. It was obvious that he knew it&rsquo;s better not to piss off Lucas even more, but he was also afraid of what&rsquo;s going to happen to his classmate. Eliott let out a sigh, eyes fixed on the short boy&rsquo;s face.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Hey, Lucas.&rdquo; He mumbled, regretting the moment he said it, because he could basically see the boy in front of him flaming up. He remembered that moment of Hades from Hercules when he goes full red in anger. Lucas seemed to be not far from looking like that.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I so wanna punch you in the face right now.&rdquo; he huffed, looking at him with sparkling anger in his eyes.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Well, you did just that with a door yesterday.&rdquo; he said with a weak smile on his face, trying to light up the mood somehow.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you dare.&rdquo; Lucas said, raising up his finger.&nbsp;&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you dare bringing up yesterday. I swear to god&hellip;.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, okay.&rdquo; he sighed, scratching the back of his neck now.&nbsp;&ldquo;I was staring at my phone for hours, being afraid of your reaction.&rdquo; he mumbled honestly and looked at the ceiling.&nbsp;&ldquo;I knew that you&rsquo;ll be mad&hellip; but I couldn&rsquo;t bring myself to tell you sooner.&rdquo; he explained, but when he brought his eyes back to the boy&rsquo;s face, it wasn&rsquo;t pure anger anymore, but combined with some confusion.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Wait, you think I am mad because you are who you are?&rdquo; he asked raising his eyebrows, Eliott felt confused for a minute too.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Yeah?&rdquo; it was more of a question than a statement.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Are you serious?&rdquo; he looked at him like Eliott just said that he&rsquo;s going to be the next presient or something.&nbsp;&ldquo;I am fucking mad because you ignored me.&rdquo; he said seriously, still looking angry.&nbsp;&ldquo;Yeah, it shocked me when you revealed that fucking handsome face of yours, but I get it why you didn&rsquo;t tell me sooner.&rdquo; he sighed, rubbing his hands on his face now in frustration.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Did you just call me handsome?&rdquo; Eliott asked, not believeing his ears anymore.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo; the short boy said with a face that it&rsquo;s supposed to be obvious information. The tall one could feel the butterflies raising in his stomach, making him feel weird things now.&nbsp;&ldquo;Fuck, you are such an idiot.&rdquo; he continued, running his fingers through his hair, making even bigger of a mess out of it.&nbsp;&ldquo;I barely slept because of you.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, same here.&rdquo; Eliott sighed now and leaned back to the lockers behind him. His heart skipped a beat when a tiny smile appeared on Lucas&rsquo; face.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Asshole.&rdquo; he huffed and sighed.&nbsp;&ldquo;You are just a pain in the ass, I hope you know that.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You always make sure that I don&rsquo;t forget it.&rdquo; Eliott responded with a wide smile, to which the short boy rolled his eyes.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m still mad at you.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I know that.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Talk later?&rdquo; he asked, voice chill now and maybe even a bit playful. Eliott couldn&rsquo;t believe he was so calm and flirty all of the sudden.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Okay.&rdquo; he muttered and watched the boy walking away. He needed a few minutes to collect his thoughts and register the things that just happened between the two of them. He reached for his phone in his pocket, opening instagram to send a text.&nbsp;<br /></p><p><b>srodulv</b><br />I&rsquo;m sorry, really</p><p>The reply was basically immediate and Eliott could feel his body tense up as he read it.</p><p><b>lucallemant</b><br />It&rsquo;s okay<br /></p><p><b>srodulv</b><br />See you after school?</p><p><b>lucallemant</b><br />I&rsquo;ll check my calendar&nbsp;</p><p><b>srodulv</b><br />Very funny<br /></p><p><b>lucallemant</b><br />My humor is superior&nbsp;</p><p><b>srodulv</b><br />So, will you let me make this up to you?&nbsp;</p><p><b>lucallemant</b><br />Maybe&hellip;&nbsp;</p><p><b>srodulv</b><br />At my place, some beer and a joint?&nbsp;</p><p><b>lucallemant</b><br />Fine&nbsp;</p><p><b>srodulv</b><br />Meet me at the gate after classes&nbsp;</p><p><b>lucallemant</b><br />I hate you&nbsp;</p><p><b>srodulv</b><br />No you don&rsquo;t&nbsp;\n\n&#10084;&#65039;\n\n</p><p>He was smiling at his phone like an idiot, then he walked to his classes. Alex obviously noticed that he was in a much better mood, but wasn&rsquo;t asking any questions, which Eliott appreciated a lot. But he mentioned a party that he&rsquo;s going to host this friday. He asked him if he would like to go and of course Eliott agreed to it. Nothing is better to get himself into the school life than attending to parties.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>He was having lunch with Alex and some of the boy&rsquo;s friends. He tried to join the conversation, but he kept getting distracted by a certain group of boys sitting a few tables away from them. They were way too loud, especially the curly haired one, Basile if he remembers correctly. The worst thing is that Lucas was sitting right across him, so he had a clear view on his face. And damn if he wasn&rsquo;t the most beautiful human being around. He looked so carefree and beautiful as he laughed at something his friend was rambling about. He got stratled out of his daze when someone snapped his fingers in front of his face. He looked at Alex confused.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I asked you a question, Sherlock.&rdquo; he said rolling his eyes.&nbsp;&ldquo;Will you bring your crush to the party?&rdquo; he asked with a playful smirk on his face. The others were talking about a different subject, not paying attention to the two of them, which Eliott was grateful for.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I think he will be there. I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; he shrugged now, eating some of the parta that was laying untouched in front of him since ten minutes now.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Is it Lucas?&rdquo; he asked now, being too impatient with his friend&rsquo;s mysteriousness and the tall boy could understand him, but he also would rather not talk about this, not until he smooth things out with his little hedgehog.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wanna talk about it.&rdquo; he muttered after a minute of silence.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You guys had a fight?&rdquo; he continued the asking and it slowly started to get on Eliott&rsquo;s nerves. He didn&rsquo;t like it when people were nosy around him or tried to get into his personal life without his consent. He could feel the anger inside him build up, so he grabbed his tray from the table and got up.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Gotta go.&rdquo; that was the only thing he said before he stormed out of the cafeteria, leaving the tray on the shelf by the entrance.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>He made his way to one of the bathrooms and locked himself in a stall, sitting up on the toilet, legs pulled up to his chest. This was just so unnecessary, but he couldn&rsquo;t control his own emotions. His whole day was a fucking ride on a rollercoaster and usually that was when his illness liked to kick in. He also forgot to take his medicines last night, which was also making things worse than they already were. He decided to skip the next class, trying to avoid a possible freakout in front of everyone.&nbsp;</p><p>He sighed when he felt his phone buzzing in his pocket. He really hoped that it&rsquo;s not Alex, because he had no idea what kind of excuse he could make up to his sudden leave. He tried to avoid letting anyone know about his mental health and his struggles. It&rsquo;s easier to let people think that you are an asshole rather than they think you are crazy or look at you with pity. He fished the device out of his pocket and checked his notifications.&nbsp;</p><p><b>lucallemant</b><br />Are you okay?&nbsp;<br />I saw you storming out of the cafeteria</p><p><b>srodulv</b><br />I&rsquo;ll be fine&nbsp;</p><p>He looked at the ceiling and let the feeling of warmth spread in his chest. How fucking lucky he was to have someone in his life like Lucas. Even if he was mad at him, he was still worried, trying to reach out when he saw that Eliott was not feeling okay.&nbsp;</p><p><b>lucallemant</b><br />You need me to go there?&nbsp;<br />Where are you?&nbsp;</p><p><b>srodulv</b><br />In the bathroom&nbsp;<br />And no, stay with your friends</p><p><b>lucallemant</b><br />You are my friend too&nbsp;</p><p><b>srodulv</b><br />Ouch, straight up to the friendzone?&nbsp;<br />You have no mercy</p><p><b>lucallemant</b><br />Fuck you&nbsp;</p><p><b>srodulv&nbsp;</b><br />\n\n&#10084;&#65039;\n<br /></p><p><b>lucallemant</b><br />But seriously<br />I can go there if you want</p><p><b>srodulv</b><br />I kinda wanna be alone right now</p><p><b>lucallemant</b><br />Do you want me to stop with the texts?&nbsp;</p><p><b>srodulv</b><br />No, that&rsquo;s fine&nbsp;<br />You are kinda my safe place anyways</p><p><b>lucallemant</b><br />I&rsquo;m still mad at you, just so you know&nbsp;</p><p><b>srodulv</b><br />I know and I&rsquo;m sorry&nbsp;</p><p><b>lucallemant</b><br />Stop apologizing&nbsp;<br />You&rsquo;re being annoying</p><p><b>srodulv</b><br />Yeah, breaking news</p><p><b>lucallemant</b><br />Gotta go to class soon<br />Text me if you need anything, yeah?&nbsp;</p><p><b>srodulv</b><br />Don&rsquo;t worry, mom<br />I will be fine&nbsp;</p><p><b>lucallemant</b><br />Did you just momzoned me?&nbsp;<br />You ass&nbsp;</p><p><b>srodulv</b><br />Go to class, Lucas&nbsp;\n\n&#10084;&#65039;\n\n</p><p><b>lucallemant</b><br />Have fun in the toilet&nbsp;\n\n&#10084;&#65039;\n\n</p><p>Eliott giggled just a little, but then he noticed that Lucas also posted a picture on insta. When he saw it, his heart started to beat faster, huge grin appearing on his face. Suddenly he felt much more better, thanks to his idiot hedgehog.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/785f5830cd10e451280c680773eb79c2/tumblr_inline_prfpzoeV1s1rl818h_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p><br /></p><p>His classes ended around 15:35, so he just packed up his stuff and made his way towards the gate, waiting for Lucas there. He obviously apologized to Alex when he went to the next class after the one he skipped. The boy was a bit confused, but didn&rsquo;t ask anything, but reassured him that he is not mad at all. Eliott felt even more guilty, since it would be easier to have him angry than being understanding, cause now he felt like shit for being mad at the guy.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Hey&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>He nearly dropped his phone that he was staring at since long minutes now when he heard the voice behind him. He quickly slid it into his back pocket, turning around to see Lucas standing behind him with a smug smile on his face. Eliott had to swallow, because he just looked so fucking handsome with his disheveled hair, piercing blue eyes and that fucking grey scarf wrapped around his neck.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Hey&rdquo; he gasped after getting over the waves of emotions he got just by seeing the short boy in front of him.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;So, we&rsquo;re going to your place?&rdquo; he asked, raising his eyebrows almost in a playful way.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, of course.&rdquo; he mumbled, still shocked by the other&rsquo;s behavior. He knew that Lucas was a flirtatious little shit, but to be like this face to face too was kind of shocking. Especially since he was supposed to be a closeted gay person.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Eliott took a deep breath now, walking to the bus stop with the short boy behind him. They weren&rsquo;t talking much and it was still relaxing. Just the fact that Lucas was there next to him was so soothing and calming that they needed no words to be said. The bus came rather quickly, so they got in and took the ride to Eliott&rsquo;s place. The apartment wasn&rsquo;t too far from the stop and they still haven&rsquo;t talked to each other.&nbsp;</p><p>When they were upstairs, he unlocked the door, opening it and holding it while Lucas walked inside too. After he closed, he took off his bag and his jacket too, putting it on the rack next to the door. He waited for the boy to do the same, leaving his backpack under the jackets and he lead their way into the messy living room. He was just slightly embarrassed by the crumpled papers, empty bottles and pens laying all around on the ground.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;This place is a mess.&rdquo; Lucas stated after looking around and Eliott could feel his cheeks heating up in shame.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, I wasn&rsquo;t really in the mood to clean up last night.&rdquo; he mumbled, walking past the short boy to throw out the papers and take the bottles to the kitchen.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine, I usually have a bigger mess in my room.&rdquo; he said with a soft smile and like he&rsquo;s being home, flopped down on the couch, making himself comfortable. Eliott had to suppress a victorious smile, since he still had to redeem himself to the other.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;So, you want a beer?&rdquo; he asked from the kitchen, raising his voice a little, so the boy can hear him clearly.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, sounds good.&rdquo; Lucas responded, so he grabbed two bottles of beer from the fridge walking back to the living room. He opened them using his lighter, just catching an impressed look on the boy&rsquo;s face before it disappeared. He handed him the beer and held his own, sitting down in the armchair across from the other.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re living here alone?&rdquo; he asked after long minutes of silence, taking a sip of his beer.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Well, I have Nagini, but basically yes.&rdquo; he replied with a soft smile. It was nice to have a regular conversation with the boy.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Oh yeah, the snake.&rdquo; Lucas mumbled, gulping down the rest of his drink.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Is there something wrong with my pet?&rdquo; Eliott raised an eyebrow.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;No&hellip; well, I&rsquo;m not really a fan of reptiles, to be honest.&rdquo; he admitted and leant back on the couch, looking at the ceiling. He looked beaitful like this, his neck finally not covered by a scarf, revealing a mole close to the neck of his shirt. He wanted to kiss it so badly, but he tried to bury these feelings for now.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, he&rsquo;s not wandering around in the apartment or something.&rdquo; he joked, his face lighting up when a soft smile appeared on Lucas&rsquo; face.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Jerk.&rdquo; that was all he said and he continued to stare at the ceiling.&nbsp;<br /></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/58ae10ed6882fae51dea8db02c3e7356/tumblr_inline_prgq9jbisJ1rl818h_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>A few hours later they were in a much better mood, hence they had smoked two joints and drank three bottles of beer. Eliott was laying on the floor, legs pulled up so he could rest his sketchbook on his thighs as he was drawing. Meanwhile Lucas claimed the sofa to himself, head on the armrest while he legs pulled up enough so he can fit completely on the furniture. He was humming some melody that was stuck in his head while drumming on his legs. Eliott liked this a lot, it calmed him as he listened to the short boy.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s getting late.&rdquo; Eliott mumbled when he finished drawing and looked at his phone. It was 20:15 already, they were together since four hours now. It was so unbelieveable, since for him it seemed like an hour or even less.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Mika is going to kill me.&rdquo; Lucas sighed and glanced at the other boy, not even making an effort to get up from the couch.&nbsp;&ldquo;And tomorrow is school.&rdquo; he groaned and stretched his legs out.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, your phone won&rsquo;t stop buzzing since you posted that picture.&rdquo; he chuckled, looking at the coffee table not far from his head, still laying on the floor. Both of their phones were there, since like an hour now when they decided they need some peace and quiet.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I should not post on instagram while being high.&rdquo; he muttered and turned to his side, watching the tall one.&nbsp;&ldquo;I have to answer a shit ton of questions now.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Like who is that hot dude on your insta?&rdquo; he asked with a wide smirk on his face.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Shut up, Eli!&rdquo; he grumbled and got up from the sofa finally, stretching his body with a few moves, then looking down at the tall one, who was still on the floor.&nbsp;&ldquo;Get up your ass and walk me out!&rdquo; he demanded with a serious look on his face which made Eliott laugh. He slowly pushed himself up and put his sketchbook on the coffee table, watching Lucas pocketing his phone. They walked to the door silently. The short one put on his jacket and then grabbed his backpack. Eliott opened the door for him and he kapt standing there as he walked out, turning back to face him.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, take care on your way home.&rdquo; the tall one said after a whole minute of intense staring at each other.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, thanks for this.&rdquo; he said with a genuine smile on his face.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;No big deal. Text me when you got home, yeah?&rdquo; he asked softly and had to suppress a giggle when the short boy rolled his eyes.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Stop being like this.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Fine. See you at school tomorrow?&rdquo; he tilted his head, flashing a charming smile towards the boy, enjoying his returned confidence. It was still making him nervous being so close to someone he was crushing on since a while now, but the alcohol and weed combo inside him helped a lot to push that down.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Sure, I think the girls will have questions to both of us.&rdquo; he sighed, but a smug smile appeared on his face, like he enjoyed the situation.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Well, we are just two buds, hanging out after school, right?&rdquo; he winked playfully which made the short one laugh.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Okay, good night, Eliott.&rdquo; he said and started to walk towards the stairs.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Good night, Lucas.&rdquo; he muttered and walked back inside, closing the door and then leaning his back to it. His face hurt from the huge grin he had on it, but he couldn&rsquo;t care less. He spent hours together with Lucas, he posted a picture of him on his instagram and it was just so perfect.&nbsp;<br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><hr /><p><i>Okay guys, this is really going to be a soft love story of two idiots!
