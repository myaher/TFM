        "question": "Greek philosophers had four types of love: filia (affection, loyalty), eros (sexual, intimate love), storge (instinctual love, empathy), agape (charity, unconditional love). What's confusing is that Jaqen is affectionate, does things that can be romantic but not sexual, says they're friends when they're not really. He definitely sees Arya as some sort of equal but then he calls her Lady like giving loyalty but also charity. Jaqen gives Arya all types of love and GRRM did this very intentionally.",
        "answer": "<p>Jaqen is not sexual with Arya because of her age. It is Arya who is stunned by his looks as if she switched places with Sansa. He says they are friends and he means it, his coin let her escape Westeros. My Lady of Stark title is a reminder of Rhaegar courting Lyanna. It is the same unconditional love Rhaegar felt for <i>his lady of Stark</i>. Arya will be older when they meet again. Not Lyanna\u2019s age but not a child he left in Harrenhal either. Every type of love is possible from now on. What does GRRM want to do with them? Does he want to comfort readers after Rhaegar/Lyanna tragedy? Or is he reviving this love to destroy it again?</p>",
