R. Martin</a>\u2018s <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em> and watch HBO\u2019s <em>Game of Thrones</em>, both series. For all of you who have seen the entire series and/or read all the books, here is your chance to experience it for the first time all over again!</p>\n<p><strong>Why I Chose it:</strong> I had tried watching the series a few times and only ever reached the half-way point of the first season. Then I was in Calgary visiting my friend, and she wanted to watch <em>Game of Thrones</em>. I was curious to see it, and it was fantastic. I had to know everything that happened. But I\u2019m not just satisfied with the TV show. I love to know all the details from the books too. I expect this is going to be a momentous task, and I hope I\u2019m up for the challenge.</p>\n<p>If you haven\u2019t seen the series, <strong>there will be spoilers</strong> as we go along. If you have seen it, I\u2019d love to hear what you think in the comments, but <strong><em>please, please, please, don\u2019t spoil future seasons or books</em></strong> for me.</p>\n<p>This month, we take a look at season six of <em>Game of Thrones</em>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Body\"><img data-attachment-id=\"17755\" data-permalink=\"http://speculativechic.com/2018/11/02/a-year-of-thrones-game-of-thrones-season-6/poster/\" data-orig-file=\"http://speculativechic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Poster.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1136,1682\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Poster\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"http://speculativechic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Poster.jpg?w=203\" data-large-file=\"http://speculativechic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Poster.jpg?w=692\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-17755\" src=\"http://speculativechic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Poster.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"888\"/><br/><img data-attachment-id=\"17750\" data-permalink=\"http://speculativechic.com/2018/11/02/a-year-of-thrones-game-of-thrones-season-6/the-red-woman-1/\" data-orig-file=\"http://speculativechic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/The-Red-Woman-1.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1643,1000\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"The Red Woman 1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"http://speculativechic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/The-Red-Woman-1.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"http://speculativechic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/The-Red-Woman-1.jpg?w=840\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-17750 alignright\" src=\"http://speculativechic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/The-Red-Woman-1-300x183.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"183\"/> Episode 1 \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3658014/?ref_=ttep_ep1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Red Woman</a></p>\n<p>Bit of a bleak start to the season. It was to be expected, I suppose, with the murder of Jon Snow at the end of the last season, and Arya going blind.</p>\n<p>Theon continues to redeem himself, helping Sansa, standing between her and Ramsey\u2019s men. So glad Brienne and Podrick showed up though to help them.</p>\n<p>Davos asking Melisandre to bring Jon back to life was a nice twist. She was so confident, to the point of arrogance, about her faith. She had Shereen burned at the stake because of her faith. And now she\u2019s doubting herself, her powers, her god, everything. Davos, who had no use for her or her Lord of Light, who thought she was a sham, needs some kind of faith, some kind of belief, after all he has seen. The trick with the necklace, when she takes it off and ages a few hundred years, it was an interesting way to show that maybe there actually is something to this Lord of Light.

Well, I liked his mother and sister. The father was every bit as hateful as I expected. I admit, I was hoping Sam would say something to his father, but I could see him fading back into the person he was, crushed under the years of abuse, believing what his father said about him. I hated that he was going to leave Gilly there, even after her Wildling status was outed. I was proud of Sam when he marched back into her room, got her and Little Sam, and his father\u2019s sword and left for the Citadel.</p>\n<p class=\"Body\"><br/>\nEpisode 7 \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4283060/?ref_=ttep_ep7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Broken Man</a></p>\n<p>I gasped when she got stabbed. It was inevitable, but still, it\u2019s Arya. Sandor Clegane continues to intrigue me. He portrays himself as such a hard, cruel man, and yet he is protective and almost seems to care about people. My favorite, though, is Lady Lyanna Mormont. Good God that kid is adorable, both the actress and as the character she plays. A force to be reckoned with. Smart too. But alas, she can only spare 62 men to Jon and Sansa\u2019s campaign against Ramsey.</p>\n<p><img data-attachment-id=\"17745\" data-permalink=\"http://speculativechic.com/2018/11/02/a-year-of-thrones-game-of-thrones-season-6/no-one-1/\" data-orig-file=\"http://speculativechic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/No-One-1.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1502,1000\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"No One 1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"http://speculativechic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/No-One-1.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"http://speculativechic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/No-One-1.jpg?w=840\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-17745\" src=\"http://speculativechic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/No-One-1-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"399\"/></p>\n\n<p class=\"Body\">Episode 8 \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4283074/?ref_=ttep_ep8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">No One</a></p>\n<p>Arya was the highlight of this episode for me. She has a murderous instinct, understands revenge, and yet she\u2019s shown compassion in not killing Lady Crane. Arya\u2019s survival skills are on full display here as she runs. That waif is creepy, almost inhuman in her hunt of Arya. She is so cold and calculated. It was almost a scene out of a Jason Bourne movie now that I think about it.

Now that\u2019s out of my system, I can back up a little. I\u2019ve struggled with the presence of the High Sparrow and his ilk and I think I figured it out. Mostly, I just don\u2019t like them. Their role is quite interesting, and I think quite historical in the way the Christian Church took over Europe. We saw it both with the Priestess of the Lord of Light in Meereen, and here with the High Sparrow and Margaery. Politicians negotiated with the priests who had the ears of the people, to convince the people to obey their government, in return for greater status. The priestess in Meereen didn\u2019t care that Tyrion believed in the Lord of Light, she knew that she had the ear of the people and she was the only way Tyrion was going to get the citizens to follow Daenerys. Whether Margaery was as devout a follower of the Seven as she was professing to be, and I had my suspicions she wasn\u2019t, she had negotiated with the High Sparrow to save her brother, solidify her status as the Queen, and do away with Cersei once and for all. But religious zealots don\u2019t play by the rules. The High Sparrow went back on his promise to Margaery on letting her brother Loras return to High Garden. I don\u2019t like that they don\u2019t play by the rules. They also suck the life out of the people. Never was \u201cReligion is the Opiate of the Masses\u201d so visually demonstrated. \u00a0The darker costuming, the starker jewelry, the less opulent hair, the dirty sack-cloth clothing, the people chanting mindlessly whatever the High Sparrow or Septas said. It will be interesting to see where it goes from here, now that Cersei\u2019s blown up the Sept of Balor.</p>\n<p><img data-attachment-id=\"17752\" data-permalink=\"http://speculativechic.com/2018/11/02/a-year-of-thrones-game-of-thrones-season-6/winds-of-winter-1/\" data-orig-file=\"http://speculativechic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Winds-of-Winter-1.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1777,999\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Winds of Winter 1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"http://speculativechic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Winds-of-Winter-1.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"http://speculativechic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Winds-of-Winter-1.jpg?w=840\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-17752\" src=\"http://speculativechic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Winds-of-Winter-1-300x169.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"337\"/>Tommen\u2019s death, though. It was a nice swan dive out the window. It\u2019s too bad. Not that I had a great love for Tommen. He was a sweet kid. It\u2019s interesting that Cersei had about as much control of him as she did of Joffrey, which is to say she had none. Her lack of control opened them up to the manipulation of Margaery.</p>\n<p>The death of Grand Maester Pycelle at the hands of the children was far more effective in the book with Varys controlling the children.</p>\n<p>I can\u2019t end this post without talking about Sam Tarly.

For all of you who have seen the entire series and/or read all the books, here is your chance to experience it for the first time all over again!</p>\n<p><strong>Why I Chose it:</strong> I had tried watching the series a few times and only ever reached the half-way point of the first season. Then I was in Calgary visiting my friend, and she wanted to watch <em>Game of Thrones</em>. I was curious to see it, and it was fantastic. I had to know everything that happened. But I\u2019m not just satisfied with the TV show. I love to know all the details from the books too. I expect this is going to be a momentous task, and I hope I\u2019m up for the challenge.</p>\n<p>If you haven\u2019t seen the series, <strong>there will be spoilers</strong> as we go along. If you have seen it, I\u2019d love to hear what you think in the comments, but <strong><em>please, please, please, don\u2019t spoil future seasons or books</em></strong> for me.</p>\n<p>This month, we take a look at season six of <em>Game of Thrones</em>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Body\"><img data-attachment-id=\"17755\" data-permalink=\"http://speculativechic.com/2018/11/02/a-year-of-thrones-game-of-thrones-season-6/poster/\" data-orig-file=\"http://speculativechic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Poster.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1136,1682\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Poster\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"http://speculativechic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Poster.jpg?w=203\" data-large-file=\"http://speculativechic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Poster.jpg?w=692\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-17755\" src=\"http://speculativechic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Poster.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"888\"><br><img data-attachment-id=\"17750\" data-permalink=\"http://speculativechic.com/2018/11/02/a-year-of-thrones-game-of-thrones-season-6/the-red-woman-1/\" data-orig-file=\"http://speculativechic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/The-Red-Woman-1.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1643,1000\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"The Red Woman 1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"http://speculativechic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/The-Red-Woman-1.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"http://speculativechic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/The-Red-Woman-1.jpg?w=840\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-17750 alignright\" src=\"http://speculativechic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/The-Red-Woman-1-300x183.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"183\"> Episode 1 \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3658014/?ref_=ttep_ep1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Red Woman</a></p>\n<p>Bit of a bleak start to the season.

She was so confident, to the point of arrogance, about her faith. She had Shereen burned at the stake because of her faith. And now she\u2019s doubting herself, her powers, her god, everything. Davos, who had no use for her or her Lord of Light, who thought she was a sham, needs some kind of faith, some kind of belief, after all he has seen. The trick with the necklace, when she takes it off and ages a few hundred years, it was an interesting way to show that maybe there actually is something to this Lord of Light. Maybe Melisandre can save Jon.</p>\n<div class=\"tiled-gallery type-rectangular tiled-gallery-unresized\" data-original-width=\"840\" data-carousel-extra='{\"blog_id\":113930418,\"permalink\":false,\"likes_blog_id\":113930418}' itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/ImageGallery\"> <div class=\"gallery-row\" style=\"width: 840px;

Well, I liked his mother and sister. The father was every bit as hateful as I expected. I admit, I was hoping Sam would say something to his father, but I could see him fading back into the person he was, crushed under the years of abuse, believing what his father said about him. I hated that he was going to leave Gilly there, even after her Wildling status was outed. I was proud of Sam when he marched back into her room, got her and Little Sam, and his father\u2019s sword and left for the Citadel.</p>\n<p class=\"Body\"><br>\nEpisode 7 \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4283060/?ref_=ttep_ep7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Broken Man</a></p>\n<p>I gasped when she got stabbed. It was inevitable, but still, it\u2019s Arya. Sandor Clegane continues to intrigue me. He portrays himself as such a hard, cruel man, and yet he is protective and almost seems to care about people. My favorite, though, is Lady Lyanna Mormont. Good God that kid is adorable, both the actress and as the character she plays. A force to be reckoned with. Smart too. But alas, she can only spare 62 men to Jon and Sansa\u2019s campaign against Ramsey.</p>\n<p><img data-attachment-id=\"17745\" data-permalink=\"http://speculativechic.com/2018/11/02/a-year-of-thrones-game-of-thrones-season-6/no-one-1/\" data-orig-file=\"http://speculativechic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/No-One-1.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1502,1000\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"No One 1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"http://speculativechic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/No-One-1.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"http://speculativechic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/No-One-1.jpg?w=840\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-17745\" src=\"http://speculativechic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/No-One-1-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"399\"></p>\n\n<p class=\"Body\">Episode 8 \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4283074/?ref_=ttep_ep8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">No One</a></p>\n<p>Arya was the highlight of this episode for me. She has a murderous instinct, understands revenge, and yet she\u2019s shown compassion in not killing Lady Crane. Arya\u2019s survival skills are on full display here as she runs. That waif is creepy, almost inhuman in her hunt of Arya. She is so cold and calculated. It was almost a scene out of a Jason Bourne movie now that I think about it. I am glad Arya didn\u2019t lose herself completely. She didn\u2019t fully embrace becoming no one.

Now that\u2019s out of my system, I can back up a little. I\u2019ve struggled with the presence of the High Sparrow and his ilk and I think I figured it out. Mostly, I just don\u2019t like them. Their role is quite interesting, and I think quite historical in the way the Christian Church took over Europe. We saw it both with the Priestess of the Lord of Light in Meereen, and here with the High Sparrow and Margaery. Politicians negotiated with the priests who had the ears of the people, to convince the people to obey their government, in return for greater status. The priestess in Meereen didn\u2019t care that Tyrion believed in the Lord of Light, she knew that she had the ear of the people and she was the only way Tyrion was going to get the citizens to follow Daenerys. Whether Margaery was as devout a follower of the Seven as she was professing to be, and I had my suspicions she wasn\u2019t, she had negotiated with the High Sparrow to save her brother, solidify her status as the Queen, and do away with Cersei once and for all. But religious zealots don\u2019t play by the rules. The High Sparrow went back on his promise to Margaery on letting her brother Loras return to High Garden. I don\u2019t like that they don\u2019t play by the rules. They also suck the life out of the people. Never was \u201cReligion is the Opiate of the Masses\u201d so visually demonstrated. \u00a0The darker costuming, the starker jewelry, the less opulent hair, the dirty sack-cloth clothing, the people chanting mindlessly whatever the High Sparrow or Septas said. It will be interesting to see where it goes from here, now that Cersei\u2019s blown up the Sept of Balor.</p>\n<p><img data-attachment-id=\"17752\" data-permalink=\"http://speculativechic.com/2018/11/02/a-year-of-thrones-game-of-thrones-season-6/winds-of-winter-1/\" data-orig-file=\"http://speculativechic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Winds-of-Winter-1.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1777,999\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Winds of Winter 1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"http://speculativechic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Winds-of-Winter-1.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"http://speculativechic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Winds-of-Winter-1.jpg?w=840\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-17752\" src=\"http://speculativechic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Winds-of-Winter-1-300x169.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"337\">Tommen\u2019s death, though. It was a nice swan dive out the window. It\u2019s too bad. Not that I had a great love for Tommen. He was a sweet kid. It\u2019s interesting that Cersei had about as much control of him as she did of Joffrey, which is to say she had none. Her lack of control opened them up to the manipulation of Margaery.</p>\n<p>The death of Grand Maester Pycelle at the hands of the children was far more effective in the book with Varys controlling the children.</p>\n<p>I can\u2019t end this post without talking about Sam Tarly. I was right there with him the moment he walked into that library, in awe of all those books and the education that awaited him. Any bibliophile can understand that feeling of bliss. If there\u2019s a heaven, that is it!</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">General thoughts</h2>\n<p>This season had a lot of blood and guts and gore and yet somehow it was easier to watch than the previous one. There were a couple of things I knew would happen, like that Melissandre would become a hag for a moment, and that she would bring Jon back to life. For the most part, though, I didn\u2019t know what was going to happen, and it was really nice getting into the show and just enjoying it.</p>\n<p>Next up, Season 7</p>\n<p>These are my observations, what about you? Did I miss something you loved, or hated? Let\u2019s talk Season 6!</p>\n<a href=\"http://speculativechic.com/2018/11/02/a-year-of-thrones-game-of-thrones-season-6/\">A Year of Thrones: Game of Thrones Season\u00a06</a>\n\nThis year I resolved to read\u00a0George R.

For all of you who have seen the entire series and/or read all the books, here is your chance to experience it for the first time all over again!</p>\n<p><strong>Why I Chose it:</strong> I had tried watching the series a few times and only ever reached the half-way point of the first season. Then I was in Calgary visiting my friend, and she wanted to watch <em>Game of Thrones</em>. I was curious to see it, and it was fantastic. I had to know everything that happened. But I\u2019m not just satisfied with the TV show. I love to know all the details from the books too. I expect this is going to be a momentous task, and I hope I\u2019m up for the challenge.</p>\n<p>If you haven\u2019t seen the series, <strong>there will be spoilers</strong> as we go along. If you have seen it, I\u2019d love to hear what you think in the comments, but <strong><em>please, please, please, don\u2019t spoil future seasons or books</em></strong> for me.</p>\n<p>This month, we take a look at season six of <em>Game of Thrones</em>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Body\"><img data-attachment-id=\"17755\" data-permalink=\"http://speculativechic.com/2018/11/02/a-year-of-thrones-game-of-thrones-season-6/poster/\" data-orig-file=\"http://speculativechic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Poster.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1136,1682\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Poster\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"http://speculativechic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Poster.jpg?w=203\" data-large-file=\"http://speculativechic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Poster.jpg?w=692\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-17755\" src=\"http://speculativechic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Poster.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"888\"><br><img data-attachment-id=\"17750\" data-permalink=\"http://speculativechic.com/2018/11/02/a-year-of-thrones-game-of-thrones-season-6/the-red-woman-1/\" data-orig-file=\"http://speculativechic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/The-Red-Woman-1.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1643,1000\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"The Red Woman 1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"http://speculativechic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/The-Red-Woman-1.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"http://speculativechic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/The-Red-Woman-1.jpg?w=840\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-17750 alignright\" src=\"http://speculativechic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/The-Red-Woman-1-300x183.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"183\"> Episode 1 \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3658014/?ref_=ttep_ep1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Red Woman</a></p>\n<p>Bit of a bleak start to the season.

She was so confident, to the point of arrogance, about her faith. She had Shereen burned at the stake because of her faith. And now she\u2019s doubting herself, her powers, her god, everything. Davos, who had no use for her or her Lord of Light, who thought she was a sham, needs some kind of faith, some kind of belief, after all he has seen. The trick with the necklace, when she takes it off and ages a few hundred years, it was an interesting way to show that maybe there actually is something to this Lord of Light. Maybe Melisandre can save Jon.</p>\n<div class=\"tiled-gallery type-rectangular tiled-gallery-unresized\" data-original-width=\"840\" data-carousel-extra='{\"blog_id\":113930418,\"permalink\":false,\"likes_blog_id\":113930418}' itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/ImageGallery\"> <div class=\"gallery-row\" style=\"width: 840px;

Well, I liked his mother and sister. The father was every bit as hateful as I expected.

Now that\u2019s out of my system, I can back up a little. I\u2019ve struggled with the presence of the High Sparrow and his ilk and I think I figured it out. Mostly, I just don\u2019t like them. Their role is quite interesting, and I think quite historical in the way the Christian Church took over Europe. We saw it both with the Priestess of the Lord of Light in Meereen, and here with the High Sparrow and Margaery. Politicians negotiated with the priests who had the ears of the people, to convince the people to obey their government, in return for greater status. The priestess in Meereen didn\u2019t care that Tyrion believed in the Lord of Light, she knew that she had the ear of the people and she was the only way Tyrion was going to get the citizens to follow Daenerys. Whether Margaery was as devout a follower of the Seven as she was professing to be, and I had my suspicions she wasn\u2019t, she had negotiated with the High Sparrow to save her brother, solidify her status as the Queen, and do away with Cersei once and for all. But religious zealots don\u2019t play by the rules. The High Sparrow went back on his promise to Margaery on letting her brother Loras return to High Garden. I don\u2019t like that they don\u2019t play by the rules. They also suck the life out of the people. Never was \u201cReligion is the Opiate of the Masses\u201d so visually demonstrated. \u00a0The darker costuming, the starker jewelry, the less opulent hair, the dirty sack-cloth clothing, the people chanting mindlessly whatever the High Sparrow or Septas said.

R. Martin\u2019s A Song of Ice and Fire\u2026</p>",
                "content": "<p><p>This year <a href=\"https://wp.me/p7I2vo-32F\" target=\"_blank\">I resolved</a> to read&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.georgerrmartin.com\" target=\"_blank\">George R. R. Martin</a>&lsquo;s <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em> and watch HBO&rsquo;s <em>Game of Thrones</em>, both series. For all of you who have seen the entire series and/or read all the books, here is your chance to experience it for the first time all over again!</p>\n<p><strong>Why I Chose it:</strong> I had tried watching the series a few times and only ever reached the half-way point of the first season. Then I was in Calgary visiting my friend, and she wanted to watch <em>Game of Thrones</em>. I was curious to see it, and it was fantastic. I had to know everything that happened. But I&rsquo;m not just satisfied with the TV show. I love to know all the details from the books too. I expect this is going to be a momentous task, and I hope I&rsquo;m up for the challenge.</p>\n<p>If you haven&rsquo;t seen the series, <strong>there will be spoilers</strong> as we go along. If you have seen it, I&rsquo;d love to hear what you think in the comments, but <strong><em>please, please, please, don&rsquo;t spoil future seasons or books</em></strong> for me.</p>\n<p>This month, we take a look at season six of <em>Game of Thrones</em>.</p>\n\n<p><div class=\"external-image-wrapper\" data-loading-text=\"Loading...\" data-src=\"http://speculativechic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Poster.jpg\">External image</div><br /><div class=\"external-image-wrapper\" data-loading-text=\"Loading...\" data-src=\"http://speculativechic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/The-Red-Woman-1-300x183.jpg\">External image</div> Episode 1 &ndash; <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3658014/?ref_=ttep_ep1\" target=\"_blank\">The Red Woman</a></p>\n<p>Bit of a bleak start to the season. It was to be expected, I suppose, with the murder of Jon Snow at the end of the last season, and Arya going blind.</p>\n<p>Theon continues to redeem himself, helping Sansa, standing between her and Ramsey&rsquo;s men. So glad Brienne and Podrick showed up though to help them.</p>\n<p>Davos asking Melisandre to bring Jon back to life was a nice twist. She was so confident, to the point of arrogance, about her faith. She had Shereen burned at the stake because of her faith. And now she&rsquo;s doubting herself, her powers, her god, everything. Davos, who had no use for her or her Lord of Light, who thought she was a sham, needs some kind of faith, some kind of belief, after all he has seen. The trick with the necklace, when she takes it off and ages a few hundred years, it was an interesting way to show that maybe there actually is something to this Lord of Light. Maybe Melisandre can save Jon.</p>\n    <div class=\"external-image-wrapper\" data-loading-text=\"Loading...\" data-src=\"http://i1.wp.com/speculativechic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Home-3.jpg?w=381&amp;h=254\">External image</div>      <div class=\"external-image-wrapper\" data-loading-text=\"Loading...\" data-src=\"http://i2.wp.com/speculativechic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Home-2.jpg?w=451&amp;h=254\">External image</div>         <div class=\"external-image-wrapper\" data-loading-text=\"Loading...\" data-src=\"http://i2.wp.com/speculativechic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Home-.jpg?w=836&amp;h=368\">External image</div>      \n<p><br />\nEpisode 2 &ndash; <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4131606/?ref_=ttep_ep3\" target=\"_blank\">Home</a></p>\n<p>This wasn&rsquo;t the most interesting of episodes.

I did enjoy her taking revenge on the Khals and showing the Dothraki her strength because as Mormont had previously said to her, they only follow strength.</p>\n<p>I love that Jon and Sansa had a warm reunion.

        "description": "<p>When Season 7 of HBO\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/game-of-thrones/\">Game of Thrones</a> ended, the Night King tore the north Wall of Westeros down with his ice-breathing dragon, allowing his army of the undead free to finally invade the countryside. The Wights\u2019 numbers are so great that we as fans should properly fear for the safety of any and all characters south of the Wall, especially given the series\u2019 propensity to kill off lead and fan-favorite characters.</p><p>Now, as we slowly gear up for Season 8, it appears like it will be all-out war in Westeros, a true battle between the living and the dead. Throughout the years, Game of Thrones has given us some iconic and breathtaking battles \u2013 like Season 2\u2019s the battle of Blackwater Bay and Season 7\u2019s Battle of the Bastards \u2013 but apparently none of that comes close to what Season 8 will deliver.</p><p><b>RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/game-of-thrones-season-8-first-look/\">Game of Thrones: First Look At Daenerys &amp; Jon in Season 8</a></b></p><p>Previously, it had been reported that <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/game-of-thrones-season-8-battle-scene-55-days/\">Season 8\u2019s climactic battle had taken 55 days to shoot</a>, which was roughly double the time it had taken director Miguel Sapochnick to film the spectacular Battle of the Bastards. But, as it turns out, that was only half of the story. \u201cThis wildly understated what really happened,\u201d an article published by <a href=\"https://ew.com/tv/2018/11/01/game-of-thrones-final-season-ew-cover-story/\">Entertainment Weekly</a> states. \u201cThe 55 nights were only for the battle\u2019s outdoor scenes at the Winterfell set.
