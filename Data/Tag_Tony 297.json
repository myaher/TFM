The bottom floor was pretty much cleared earlier, however, Steve, Bucky and the Asgardian brothers quickly sweeper the place that was left to be checked. They moved fast and with little care to themselves. Just wanting to make sure this place was safe for them all to move around in without fear of something ambushing them at night. \r</p><p>Bruce and Clint had taken Wade into a separate room away from Tony and Peter, just-in-case, Wade turned. They didn\u2019t want Peter to have to see that. \r</p><p>Sam stayed with Tony and Peter and Punk the puppy, in a large lounge-like room. The room reminded Tony of his old family mansion back in New York, lavish and gaudy in the way most rich places ended up looking. Chairs covered in the best fabrics money could buy. Ugly patterns covered everything- ordinarily, Tony would be making comments about. \r</p><p>Right then though, Tony could barely manage a wrinkled nose at it all. His mind playing back the Moment Wade had revealed the bite. His own mind torturing him over what ifs. What If they had brought the kids inside with them? Would this whole thing of been avoided?\r</p><p>Mentally cursing, Tony told his brain to stop it. Taking deep breathes he forced himself to calm down. Thinking about what-ifs wasn\u2019t going to help him now. \r</p><p>If he had a lab  or any lab equipment; he and Bruce could perhaps work to make a cure. Anything to slow the effects of the bite! As it was, they were stuck with no equipment. No electricity to run said equipment on even. All they could do was wait to see if Wade was able to overcome the disease. \r</p><p>None of them had seen anyone to survive being bitten but that didn\u2019t mean it wasn\u2019t possible. They just all had to remain hopeful. \r</p><p>Upon being separated from his friend Wade, Peter had had a tantrum for a few minutes before going quiet and is currently curled up against Tony\u2019s side. \r</p><p>It was only an hour after they had settled into the longe; the sun slowly starting to sink in the sky meaning it was already mid-afternoon; when the super soldiers finally came back. Specks of blood till covered them here and there but they were unharmed which was the most important part. \r</p><p>\u201cThe mansion is cleared, all corpses have been taken outside as well. Thor and Loki are taking them outside so that we can bury them tomorrow when we have more light and to also check the grounds for any more.\u201d Slowly Steve walks over and kneels in front of Tony and the now slumbering Peter. Exhausted from the day\u2019s stress. Punk is asleep on Peter\u2019s lap, his head tucked into Peter\u2019s belly. \u201cHow is he doing?\u201d\r</p><p>Sighing softly, Tony gently runs his fingers through Peter\u2019s hair. In the peripheral of his vision, he sees Sam slip out- most likely to go loo or to check on the others. Bucky closes the door behind Sam before making his way to where they are and sits down by Peter\u2019s feet. \r</p><p>\u201cNot good, he didn\u2019t like being separated from Wade, kept shouting and screaming to see him. Then suddenly he went quiet and did this. Didn\u2019t even move one inch once he was like this, he has only just fallen asleep. Steve, what are we going to do? We can\u2019t just leave Wade to suffer.\u201d\r</p><p>Grimacing, Steve nodded as he looked at Peter. He felt the same helplessness as Tony is, they all hated the thought of leaving Wade to suffer, but none of them could bring themselves to end it either. They all held touch hope that Wade would pull through. Bucky himself even said Wade would survive; as if any other outcome was simply out of the question. Mentally wincing, Steve again wondered if they were being selfish for waiting this out, for allowing the virus to run its course. \r</p><p>\u201cWe just need to wait 24 hours, the virus should have run it\u2019s course within that time ok?\u201d Offering a small smile, Steve places a hand on Tony\u2019s knee, giving it a gentle squeeze. \r</p><p>\u201cEverything will be ok Doll, you\u2019ll see\u201d Bucky pulled a blanket around Peter and Tony to keep them warm, as the air starts to get colder the lower the sun goes. \r</p><p>Feeling better with the two Dom\u2019s back and their warm presence surrounding him, Tony allows himself to relax finally. Exhausted from today\u2019s stress and activities, he just wanted 10 minutes to recharge. Get his emotions back into order again. \r</p><p>\u201cCome on Doll lets move you and munchkin to a bed to sleep properly, you\u2019ll hurt your back sleeping there,\u201d Smiling warmly, Bucky strokes some of Tony\u2019s now longer curls away from his eyes. The strands have started to self-clean after so long of not being able to properly shower. Groaning Tony forced himself to stand once Steve picked up Peter. \r</p><p>\u201cI hate you Frosty flakes, giving us a blanket only to tell us to move\u201d Huffing playfully, Tony wraps the blanket around his sleeping son in the Blonde Dom\u2019s arms. \u201cDamn I really want a shower, remind me to find the boiler and generators in the morning\u201d \r</p><p>Growling in annoyance, Tony fiddled with the generator in the basement. Aiming to replace parts that rely on fuel to run with parts he had found within the mansion that morning and from their travels. If he can make the generator work without having to keep finding fuel for now. They can use the temporary electric as a chip to entice others to trust them. Giving Tony longer to make something like his arc reactor again to run the building on. \r</p><p> Behind him is Clint, Natasha and Bucky, who have all been tasked in keeping watch just in case. They had somehow forgotten to check for a basement when doing their first sweep of the place. Due to the doors leading down to the basement still being locked, they were hopeful that it\u2019s empty. \r</p><p>Still, Steve \u2018mother-hen\u2019 Rogers still insisted that some of the group went with. Due to the unknown danger, Peter had to stay with Steve upstairs to help dig holes in the gardens with the Asgardian brothers. Wade was still inside his room with Bruce and Sam. \r</p><p>So far Wade was doing well, only a mild fever is the only symptom to manifest since the bite. Upon learning of this and that Wade had survived the night, the tension over the mansion had lifted a bit. Hope spread through them all as they passed the 12th-hour mark- the maximum anyone has seen someone hold out before. \r</p><p>Suddenly, the generator whirred to life beneath his hands, lights flickering on above them. \r</p><p>\u201cYay!\u201d Grinning, Tony pats the top of the large generator fondly. \u201cGood girl sweetie, that\u2019s better huh? I\u2019ll make you better soon, promise\u201d \r</p><p>Snorting with amusement Clint leant against the side of a wine rack, arms folded across his chest. If there was anything down here, it would have found them by now. \r</p><p>\u201cYou know that\u2019s not your baby right Tones?\u201d \r</p><p>Gasping in mock horror, Tony put his hand over a fan vent quickly, \u201cHush! She will hear you! Don\u2019t listen to the silly Dom baby girl!\u201d \r</p><p>Laughing, Clint shook his head as they moved over to where the boiler sat. Checking in to see if it is working. Oh, it would be bliss to have showers again. \r</p><p>A quick check and fiddling around with the boiler and Tony declared it working. Places this far out and this big usually ran on its own system. Hopefully, the water would last. At least long enough for them to make a working renewable system. \r</p><p>\u201dThere we go, \u201d grinning, Tony stands up stretching out his muscles that have cramped up a bit from being in one position for so long. \u201cLet\u2019s go upstairs and let the others know the good knees huh?\u201d \r</p><p>Clapping his hands together the group leave the basement, taking a few bottles with them for later. For once, things were looking good for them all. Wade looks to be handling the virus well, they have a stable (for now) home with many rooms to hide and use. Bruce and Tony have talked already a little bit about making a lab here. A place where they can tend to their wounded better. \r</p><p>Upstairs, Clint and Natasha split to go to take over for Bruce and Sam. And to test the showers. \r</p><p>\u201cWanna go test the showers doll? I bet we both could use a good soaking in hot water\u201d Chuckling, Bucky winks at Tony as he directs Tony towards their rooms. \r</p><p>\u201cOh god, a hot shower sounds so good right now\u2026wait, together?\u201d Pausing Tony turns his head to look at Bucky from over his shoulder. To his credit, Bucky did actually blush a bit as he seems to think about what he just said. \r</p><p>\u201cIf you want to that is? It wouldn\u2019t be sexual, doesn\u2019t have to be sexual. I just want to relax together for a bit. Maybe soak in a warm bath after getting the dirt off?\u201d Bucky tilts his head to the side and down a bit in a bashful way. At odds with his charming smile that could charm a siren to let a ship pass by. \r</p><p>The exact same smile Tony had seen countless times on history reels from the war. In the photos displayed in exhibits at the museums. A smile that, Tony had fantasied much more about as a child than most teenage boys ought to. Dreamt of it being aimed at him when he did something good or did something that amused Barnes. Having that very same smile aimed at him, was phenomenal.\r</p><p>Despite seeing it several times already, it was still hard for Tony to believe that Bucky would aim this smile at him. \r</p><p>Looking over Bucky\u2019s face, Tony looked for anything that would indicate that Bucky is lying. He only found sincerity. A tension, that Tony wasn\u2019t even aware of, left his muscles. \r</p><p>Mentally, Tony mulled over this for a few moments, did he want to shower with Bucky? Oh god yes. However, was he ready to? It hasn\u2019t been long that they had talked about being a three-way back at the last house, after the talk they have shared the same room but not slept on the same bed. The dom\u2019s had seemed content to move at a slow pace for Tony. Letting him control the situation for now, which Tony was very grateful for actually. \r</p><p>Like now, Bucky was letting Tony decide if they moved forward or waited. Giving Tony the power, the freedom to choose. This more than anything, was what helped Tony make his decision, knowing that Bucky would keep his word as well helped. Plus, Tony really really wanted to see that body and booty!\r</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love a soak after, that is if the hot water works. Come on let\u2019s go before the child senses that I\u2019m relaxing\u201d grinning Tony takes Bucky\u2019s hand tugging him again to get moving. \u201cHonestly, kids seem to have a sixth sense for this sort of thing I swear,\u201d \r</p><p>Chuckling, Bucky allows the Sub to drag him along to the bedroom, through to the bathroom that\u2019s attached to the bedroom. Private and risk-free of anyone accidentally walking in. \r</p><p>Still, Bucky locks the door behind them, in case if Peter comes running up he assures Tony when he asks. \r</p><p>The bathroom was dim despite the midday sunlight outside. The windows were small and high up, covered in ivy that spanned the entire wall outside. The bathroom looked smaller and less daunting in the low light. The spacious tub that\u2019s sunken into the floor looked more inviting to relax than some mini swimming pool. Tony liked it, as he took off his jacket and slung it over a clothes railing. Turning around he saw Bucky struggling with his own jacket. The metal arm seemed to be paining him a bit as Bucky tried to get it off. \r</p><p>Quickly, Tony moves over to him, Gently placing a hand on Bucky\u2019s shoulder to still his metal arm, turning Bucky to face him Tony quickly undid the buttons with deft fingers. Carefully and gently, Tony eased the jacket off, murmuring to himself to check it over once their clean and he can see the arm properly. \r</p><p>Without much thought, Tony kept helping Bucky undress. Easing the shirt up and off before kneeling down, so that he could easily access the belt buckle. Easing it out carefully so that the buckle doesn\u2019t hit either of them. Standing again, Tony undoes Bucky \u2019s trousers and pushes both the trousers and the boxers underneath down so that Bucky could kick them off. Before that though, Bucky needed his boots undone so he could get them off first. Noticing this, Tony knelt and carefully undid both boots before pulling them off with one hand while the other held onto Bucky, helping him keep his balance. \r</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until Tony finally stood after helping Bucky undress that he realised what he had done. Blinking to himself, Tony had just willingly kneeled for a Dom for the first time in years. Had done one of the most basic of things, expected of Subs before he had really thought about it. \r</p><p>Giving his head a small shake, Tony decided to ignore the last 2 minutes he goes to start undressing. \r</p><p>\u201cLet me help Doll,\u201d Softly, Bucky murmured as he moves to get in front of Tony. Gently and slowly, so as to not alarm or startled Tony maybe, Bucky uses his good arm and hand to unbutton his shirt. Efficiently yet gently Bucky removes bit by bit. Something not many Dom\u2019s in Tony\u2019s experience had been willing to do.\r</p><p>Many had seen sub service actions beneath them and purely a Sub trait, Tony had only heard of Dom\u2019s willing to serve their Sub\u2019s in articles online or in rumours. \r</p><p>Deciding not to dwell on it, Tony just stayed still, only moving when prompted and enjoyed being looked after for a few moments. Just this simple act of kindness made him relax more in Bucky\u2019s presence. \r</p><p>For the first time in years, Tony could feel the start of a sub drop creep on him. A gentle soothing sensation that made him feel soft and fuzzy. For once, it wasn\u2019t being met with resistance. Tony didn\u2019t want to resist this time, he actually felt safe enough to allow it to wash over him a bit. \r</p><p>Tony never thought he would welcome the day where he could still sink into a sub drop. \r</p><p>Belatedly, Tony heard Bucky murmur to him and gesturing for him to sit on the toilet seat, as he starts the shower to test the water. Idly, Tony watches Bucky test the temperature, grinning sleepily when Bucky cheered as it actually heated up. \r</p><p>\u201cCome on doll lets get in. You\u2019ll feel better once clean I promise.\u201d Smiling softly, Bucky urges Tony to stand and move to the spacious shower. Smaller than Tony\u2019s old custom one back in Malibu when he lived there, but still large enough to move about comfortably in. \r</p><p>The moment the hot water touched Tony\u2019s body, he immediately slumped into the spray with a groan. The water felt heavenly on his aching muscles. Distantly, Tony heard an amused chuckle behind him as Bucky reached for the soap. \r</p><p>Tony startled a bit as he felt soaped hands start to wash him off, of all the grime that had stuck to him. Bucky\u2019s hands were sure but quick as they scrubbed away, allowing Tony to float a bit in his head. Enjoying the warmth of the shower as steam rose. Adding an extra blanket of warmth that wraps around his senses. \r</p><p>Detaching the shower head, Bucky quickly rinsed Tony off before returning it and gently nudges out of the way. Murmuring to Tony that he won\u2019t take to long to wash and then Tony could get back under it. \r</p><p>Coming back a bit to his senses, Tony moves to the side but also takes the soap from Bucky\u2019s hands. \r</p><p>\u201cLet me help you, James, Your arm isn\u2019t looking to good ok?\u201d \r</p><p>With a grateful smile, Bucky catches Tony\u2019s eye and nods at him before turning to give Tony his back. Quickly soaping up his hands Tony finally gets a good look at Bucky\u2019s back. \r</p><p>The mass of scars that spider out over his shoulder in a kind of morbid maze immediately drew Tony\u2019s eye. As Tony gently washed out all the dirt from the area, making sure the skin around the metal wasn\u2019t aggravated or inflamed, he realised how smiler the mess looks compared to Tony\u2019s own scars on his chest. Both scars stood as symbols of just what they had both survived. The trials they had faced in life that helped to mould who they are today. \r</p><p>Tearing his eyes from Bucky\u2019s shoulder, when he felt his shoulders tense a bit, obviously aware of what Tony was looking at. Tony got started on washing away the rest of the dirt. Each patch cleaned revealed more scars, most of them old- obviously from his Winter Soldier days. back from the days, the Soldier had fewer qualms about injuring the body and only focused on finishing the job. Scars from the tests the Hydra scientists put him through or used him as a shield. \r</p><p>Finally finishing the back, Tony taps Bucky\u2019s shoulder, \u201cturn around please?\u201d Looking up, Tony\u2019s eyes again catches Bucky\u2019s. A guarded look had come over his eyes, as Bucky had felt Tony finding more and more scars. There as also an odd sort of vulnerability in Bucky\u2019 face a well, as he had let Tony take them all in. \r</p><p>Looking into Tony\u2019s eyes, Bucky could see a similar look in his, along with understanding. They both had too many scars to count, all from various things such as stupid childhood stunts to accidents to battle inflicted wound. They both had scars that weren\u2019t visible to the naked eye. \r</p><p>The contact was broken as the water pipes spluttered for a moment, the water turning a bit colder before heating again. It was enough to cause Tony to jump, breaking the eye contact between them. After a brief pause, they both chuckled a bit. Tony\u2019s head still floating a bit but not deeply.\r</p><p>\u201cNearly finished Terminator ok? I\u2019ll have you smelling of roses in no time,\u201d Grinning cheekily, Tony starts on washing the front of Bucky\u2019 body, using quick efficient strokes, the dirt was soon being washed away down the drain. Tony took his time though to carefully clean the metal arm. Working away as much grime as he could, for now, already the arm was moving better as gunk was cleaned from between the plates. \r</p><p>They both shampooed their hair twice to get it feeling clean again, each helping the other, playful teasing between them as Tony leant his forehead on Bucky\u2019s chest. Eyes closed as Bucky\u2019 magic fingers worked out knots in Tony\u2019s hair. \r</p><p>\u201cDamn, Tony you finally smell like a real boy and not a rust bucket filled with stagnant water,\u201d \r</p><p>\u201cThank you Snowflake for that oh so wonderful compliment. Really warms my heart,\u201d snorting Tony shook his head as the last of the shampoo was washed away. He let out a surprised eep when two arms pulled him back into Bucky\u2019s chest, his nose shifting to sit behind Tony\u2019s ear. A steady breath could be heard as Bucky simply held him. \r</p><p>Relaxing, Tony leaned back into the contact and closed his eyes, letting his mind wander as they simply soaked in the other\u2019s presence and warmth. \r</p><p>Tony could feel the half hard cock resting against his thighs, that Bucky seemed content to ignore. So Tony pushed it from his mind. They were both half hard from the gently soothing touches. The intimacy making their bodies feel good but there was no urgency to get off. They were both happy to just hold one another. \r</p><p>It was too soon for anything else and they were fine with that for now, but in the darkened bathroom together, they could just be. \r</p><p>They weren\u2019t sure how long they stood there like this, soaking in the warmth of the other. Enjoying each other\u2019s company when they heard the bedroom door swing open. Jolting apart, they could hear Steve\u2019s amused tone drifting over the spray of water. They could also hear Peter\u2019s non-stop excitable chatter it wasn\u2019t long till a knock on the door came. \r</p><p>\u201cHey! It\u2019s us, is it Tony or Bucky in there? Pete needs to use the bathroom!\u201d \r</p><p>Chuckling, Bucky reached up and switched off the water, despite the pout Tony aimed at him. \u201cNone of that now, Junior needs to use the bathroom\u201d winking, Bucky ducks his head to peck a kiss on Tony\u2019s lips before slipping out of the shower stall. He grabs a towel, wrapping it around his waist securely, grabbing another he wraps it around Tony\u2019s shoulders. Unlocking the door he herds Tony out into the bedroom and pushes him gently towards a shocked Steve. \r</p><p>Peter on the other hand, barely batted an eyelid at his dad in a towel, more interested in the hot water as he caught sight of steam streaming out of the bathroom. \r</p><p>\u201cCome on squirt, your turn to use the bathroom and have a wash while you\u2019re at it. The hot water finally works!\u201d Grinning, Bucky shows the kid how to use the shower and gets him a towel ready before leaving him to it. Leaving the door open just a crack in case of emergencies. \r</p><p>Sauntering over to the other two, Bucky smirked at Steve who had yet to really close his mouth but was helping Tony dry. \r</p><p>\u201cHey Stevie, the hot water works by the way,\u201d \r</p><p>\u201cSo I can see..\u201dSteve gave Bucky an unimpressed look as Tony slapped away Steve\u2019s hands so he could go get dressed. Steve couldn\u2019t help but watch him walk away as Tony dropped his towel to grab his clothes. Blushing, Steve quickly looked away politely, instead he caught Bucky\u2019s eyes. Raising an eyebrow, Steve gave Bucky a questioning look. Shaking his head, Bucky understood what he was silently asking. If they had been playing around in the bathroom. \r</p><p>Steve nodded in understanding, smiling at him before turning to the now mostly dressed Tony. \r</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d hug you but er, your finally clean of dirt but I\u2019m still covered and I don\u2019t want to get you dirt already\u201d grinning bashfully, Steve started to undress his top layers and left them in a pile near the door to deal with later. \u201cI see you got the generator and boiler going through baby, thank you,\u201d \r</p><p>Waving a hand dismissively, Tony grabs his toolkit and motions for Bucky to sit on the bed so he can finally look the arm over. \r</p><p>\u201cMy pleasure, seriously Cap, that shower is amazing.\u201d Grinning Tony sets to work on the arm, \u201conce you\u2019re all clean we can all just cuddle for a while.\u201d Tony paused a moment to glance at Steve, \u201cI haven\u2019t heard any news from about Wade so I\u2019m guessing everything is still ok that area?\u201d \r</p><p>\u201cYeah. I saw Bruce leave the room as we came up, Wade is doing well\u201d smiling, Steve sat in an armchair, awaiting his turn. He smiled brighter as Tony seemed to sag a bit in relief at that news.\r</p><p>Things indeed were looking up. \r</p>",

The bottom floor was pretty much cleared earlier, however, Steve, Bucky and the Asgardian brothers quickly sweeper the place that was left to be checked. They moved fast and with little care to themselves. Just wanting to make sure this place was safe for them all to move around in without fear of something ambushing them at night. \r</p><p>Bruce and Clint had taken Wade into a separate room away from Tony and Peter, just-in-case, Wade turned. They didn\u2019t want Peter to have to see that. \r</p><p>Sam stayed with Tony and Peter and Punk the puppy, in a large lounge-like room. The room reminded Tony of his old family mansion back in New York, lavish and gaudy in the way most rich places ended up looking. Chairs covered in the best fabrics money could buy. Ugly patterns covered everything- ordinarily, Tony would be making comments about. \r</p><p>Right then though, Tony could barely manage a wrinkled nose at it all. His mind playing back the Moment Wade had revealed the bite. His own mind torturing him over what ifs. What If they had brought the kids inside with them? Would this whole thing of been avoided?\r</p><p>Mentally cursing, Tony told his brain to stop it. Taking deep breathes he forced himself to calm down. Thinking about what-ifs wasn\u2019t going to help him now. \r</p><p>If he had a lab  or any lab equipment; he and Bruce could perhaps work to make a cure. Anything to slow the effects of the bite! As it was, they were stuck with no equipment. No electricity to run said equipment on even. All they could do was wait to see if Wade was able to overcome the disease. \r</p><p>None of them had seen anyone to survive being bitten but that didn\u2019t mean it wasn\u2019t possible. They just all had to remain hopeful. \r</p><p>Upon being separated from his friend Wade, Peter had had a tantrum for a few minutes before going quiet and is currently curled up against Tony\u2019s side. \r</p><p>It was only an hour after they had settled into the longe; the sun slowly starting to sink in the sky meaning it was already mid-afternoon; when the super soldiers finally came back. Specks of blood till covered them here and there but they were unharmed which was the most important part. \r</p><p>\u201cThe mansion is cleared, all corpses have been taken outside as well. Thor and Loki are taking them outside so that we can bury them tomorrow when we have more light and to also check the grounds for any more.\u201d Slowly Steve walks over and kneels in front of Tony and the now slumbering Peter. Exhausted from the day\u2019s stress. Punk is asleep on Peter\u2019s lap, his head tucked into Peter\u2019s belly. \u201cHow is he doing?\u201d\r</p><p>Sighing softly, Tony gently runs his fingers through Peter\u2019s hair. In the peripheral of his vision, he sees Sam slip out- most likely to go loo or to check on the others. Bucky closes the door behind Sam before making his way to where they are and sits down by Peter\u2019s feet. \r</p><p>\u201cNot good, he didn\u2019t like being separated from Wade, kept shouting and screaming to see him. Then suddenly he went quiet and did this. Didn\u2019t even move one inch once he was like this, he has only just fallen asleep. Steve, what are we going to do? We can\u2019t just leave Wade to suffer.\u201d\r</p><p>Grimacing, Steve nodded as he looked at Peter. He felt the same helplessness as Tony is, they all hated the thought of leaving Wade to suffer, but none of them could bring themselves to end it either. They all held touch hope that Wade would pull through. Bucky himself even said Wade would survive; as if any other outcome was simply out of the question. Mentally wincing, Steve again wondered if they were being selfish for waiting this out, for allowing the virus to run its course. \r</p><p>\u201cWe just need to wait 24 hours, the virus should have run it\u2019s course within that time ok?\u201d Offering a small smile, Steve places a hand on Tony\u2019s knee, giving it a gentle squeeze. \r</p><p>\u201cEverything will be ok Doll, you\u2019ll see\u201d Bucky pulled a blanket around Peter and Tony to keep them warm, as the air starts to get colder the lower the sun goes. \r</p><p>Feeling better with the two Dom\u2019s back and their warm presence surrounding him, Tony allows himself to relax finally. Exhausted from today\u2019s stress and activities, he just wanted 10 minutes to recharge. Get his emotions back into order again. \r</p><p>\u201cCome on Doll lets move you and munchkin to a bed to sleep properly, you\u2019ll hurt your back sleeping there,\u201d Smiling warmly, Bucky strokes some of Tony\u2019s now longer curls away from his eyes. The strands have started to self-clean after so long of not being able to properly shower. Groaning Tony forced himself to stand once Steve picked up Peter. \r</p><p>\u201cI hate you Frosty flakes, giving us a blanket only to tell us to move\u201d Huffing playfully, Tony wraps the blanket around his sleeping son in the Blonde Dom\u2019s arms. \u201cDamn I really want a shower, remind me to find the boiler and generators in the morning\u201d \r</p><p>Growling in annoyance, Tony fiddled with the generator in the basement. Aiming to replace parts that rely on fuel to run with parts he had found within the mansion that morning and from their travels. If he can make the generator work without having to keep finding fuel for now. They can use the temporary electric as a chip to entice others to trust them. Giving Tony longer to make something like his arc reactor again to run the building on. \r</p><p> Behind him is Clint, Natasha and Bucky, who have all been tasked in keeping watch just in case. They had somehow forgotten to check for a basement when doing their first sweep of the place. Due to the doors leading down to the basement still being locked, they were hopeful that it\u2019s empty. \r</p><p>Still, Steve \u2018mother-hen\u2019 Rogers still insisted that some of the group went with. Due to the unknown danger, Peter had to stay with Steve upstairs to help dig holes in the gardens with the Asgardian brothers. Wade was still inside his room with Bruce and Sam. \r</p><p>So far Wade was doing well, only a mild fever is the only symptom to manifest since the bite. Upon learning of this and that Wade had survived the night, the tension over the mansion had lifted a bit. Hope spread through them all as they passed the 12th-hour mark- the maximum anyone has seen someone hold out before. \r</p><p>Suddenly, the generator whirred to life beneath his hands, lights flickering on above them. \r</p><p>\u201cYay!\u201d Grinning, Tony pats the top of the large generator fondly. \u201cGood girl sweetie, that\u2019s better huh? I\u2019ll make you better soon, promise\u201d \r</p><p>Snorting with amusement Clint leant against the side of a wine rack, arms folded across his chest. If there was anything down here, it would have found them by now. \r</p><p>\u201cYou know that\u2019s not your baby right Tones?\u201d \r</p><p>Gasping in mock horror, Tony put his hand over a fan vent quickly, \u201cHush! She will hear you! Don\u2019t listen to the silly Dom baby girl!\u201d \r</p><p>Laughing, Clint shook his head as they moved over to where the boiler sat. Checking in to see if it is working. Oh, it would be bliss to have showers again. \r</p><p>A quick check and fiddling around with the boiler and Tony declared it working. Places this far out and this big usually ran on its own system. Hopefully, the water would last. At least long enough for them to make a working renewable system. \r</p><p>\u201dThere we go, \u201d grinning, Tony stands up stretching out his muscles that have cramped up a bit from being in one position for so long. \u201cLet\u2019s go upstairs and let the others know the good knees huh?\u201d \r</p><p>Clapping his hands together the group leave the basement, taking a few bottles with them for later. For once, things were looking good for them all. Wade looks to be handling the virus well, they have a stable (for now) home with many rooms to hide and use. Bruce and Tony have talked already a little bit about making a lab here. A place where they can tend to their wounded better. \r</p><p>Upstairs, Clint and Natasha split to go to take over for Bruce and Sam. And to test the showers. \r</p><p>\u201cWanna go test the showers doll? I bet we both could use a good soaking in hot water\u201d Chuckling, Bucky winks at Tony as he directs Tony towards their rooms. \r</p><p>\u201cOh god, a hot shower sounds so good right now\u2026wait, together?\u201d Pausing Tony turns his head to look at Bucky from over his shoulder. To his credit, Bucky did actually blush a bit as he seems to think about what he just said. \r</p><p>\u201cIf you want to that is? It wouldn\u2019t be sexual, doesn\u2019t have to be sexual. I just want to relax together for a bit. Maybe soak in a warm bath after getting the dirt off?\u201d Bucky tilts his head to the side and down a bit in a bashful way. At odds with his charming smile that could charm a siren to let a ship pass by. \r</p><p>The exact same smile Tony had seen countless times on history reels from the war. In the photos displayed in exhibits at the museums. A smile that, Tony had fantasied much more about as a child than most teenage boys ought to. Dreamt of it being aimed at him when he did something good or did something that amused Barnes. Having that very same smile aimed at him, was phenomenal.\r</p><p>Despite seeing it several times already, it was still hard for Tony to believe that Bucky would aim this smile at him. \r</p><p>Looking over Bucky\u2019s face, Tony looked for anything that would indicate that Bucky is lying. He only found sincerity. A tension, that Tony wasn\u2019t even aware of, left his muscles. \r</p><p>Mentally, Tony mulled over this for a few moments, did he want to shower with Bucky? Oh god yes. However, was he ready to? It hasn\u2019t been long that they had talked about being a three-way back at the last house, after the talk they have shared the same room but not slept on the same bed. The dom\u2019s had seemed content to move at a slow pace for Tony. Letting him control the situation for now, which Tony was very grateful for actually. \r</p><p>Like now, Bucky was letting Tony decide if they moved forward or waited. Giving Tony the power, the freedom to choose. This more than anything, was what helped Tony make his decision, knowing that Bucky would keep his word as well helped. Plus, Tony really really wanted to see that body and booty!\r</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love a soak after, that is if the hot water works. Come on let\u2019s go before the child senses that I\u2019m relaxing\u201d grinning Tony takes Bucky\u2019s hand tugging him again to get moving. \u201cHonestly, kids seem to have a sixth sense for this sort of thing I swear,\u201d \r</p><p>Chuckling, Bucky allows the Sub to drag him along to the bedroom, through to the bathroom that\u2019s attached to the bedroom. Private and risk-free of anyone accidentally walking in. \r</p><p>Still, Bucky locks the door behind them, in case if Peter comes running up he assures Tony when he asks. \r</p><p>The bathroom was dim despite the midday sunlight outside. The windows were small and high up, covered in ivy that spanned the entire wall outside. The bathroom looked smaller and less daunting in the low light. The spacious tub that\u2019s sunken into the floor looked more inviting to relax than some mini swimming pool. Tony liked it, as he took off his jacket and slung it over a clothes railing. Turning around he saw Bucky struggling with his own jacket. The metal arm seemed to be paining him a bit as Bucky tried to get it off. \r</p><p>Quickly, Tony moves over to him, Gently placing a hand on Bucky\u2019s shoulder to still his metal arm, turning Bucky to face him Tony quickly undid the buttons with deft fingers. Carefully and gently, Tony eased the jacket off, murmuring to himself to check it over once their clean and he can see the arm properly. \r</p><p>Without much thought, Tony kept helping Bucky undress. Easing the shirt up and off before kneeling down, so that he could easily access the belt buckle. Easing it out carefully so that the buckle doesn\u2019t hit either of them. Standing again, Tony undoes Bucky \u2019s trousers and pushes both the trousers and the boxers underneath down so that Bucky could kick them off. Before that though, Bucky needed his boots undone so he could get them off first. Noticing this, Tony knelt and carefully undid both boots before pulling them off with one hand while the other held onto Bucky, helping him keep his balance. \r</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until Tony finally stood after helping Bucky undress that he realised what he had done. Blinking to himself, Tony had just willingly kneeled for a Dom for the first time in years. Had done one of the most basic of things, expected of Subs before he had really thought about it. \r</p><p>Giving his head a small shake, Tony decided to ignore the last 2 minutes he goes to start undressing. \r</p><p>\u201cLet me help Doll,\u201d Softly, Bucky murmured as he moves to get in front of Tony. Gently and slowly, so as to not alarm or startled Tony maybe, Bucky uses his good arm and hand to unbutton his shirt. Efficiently yet gently Bucky removes bit by bit. Something not many Dom\u2019s in Tony\u2019s experience had been willing to do.\r</p><p>Many had seen sub service actions beneath them and purely a Sub trait, Tony had only heard of Dom\u2019s willing to serve their Sub\u2019s in articles online or in rumours. \r</p><p>Deciding not to dwell on it, Tony just stayed still, only moving when prompted and enjoyed being looked after for a few moments. Just this simple act of kindness made him relax more in Bucky\u2019s presence. \r</p><p>For the first time in years, Tony could feel the start of a sub drop creep on him. A gentle soothing sensation that made him feel soft and fuzzy. For once, it wasn\u2019t being met with resistance. Tony didn\u2019t want to resist this time, he actually felt safe enough to allow it to wash over him a bit. \r</p><p>Tony never thought he would welcome the day where he could still sink into a sub drop. \r</p><p>Belatedly, Tony heard Bucky murmur to him and gesturing for him to sit on the toilet seat, as he starts the shower to test the water. Idly, Tony watches Bucky test the temperature, grinning sleepily when Bucky cheered as it actually heated up. \r</p><p>\u201cCome on doll lets get in. You\u2019ll feel better once clean I promise.\u201d Smiling softly, Bucky urges Tony to stand and move to the spacious shower. Smaller than Tony\u2019s old custom one back in Malibu when he lived there, but still large enough to move about comfortably in. \r</p><p>The moment the hot water touched Tony\u2019s body, he immediately slumped into the spray with a groan. The water felt heavenly on his aching muscles. Distantly, Tony heard an amused chuckle behind him as Bucky reached for the soap. \r</p><p>Tony startled a bit as he felt soaped hands start to wash him off, of all the grime that had stuck to him. Bucky\u2019s hands were sure but quick as they scrubbed away, allowing Tony to float a bit in his head. Enjoying the warmth of the shower as steam rose. Adding an extra blanket of warmth that wraps around his senses. \r</p><p>Detaching the shower head, Bucky quickly rinsed Tony off before returning it and gently nudges out of the way. Murmuring to Tony that he won\u2019t take to long to wash and then Tony could get back under it. \r</p><p>Coming back a bit to his senses, Tony moves to the side but also takes the soap from Bucky\u2019s hands. \r</p><p>\u201cLet me help you, James, Your arm isn\u2019t looking to good ok?\u201d \r</p><p>With a grateful smile, Bucky catches Tony\u2019s eye and nods at him before turning to give Tony his back. Quickly soaping up his hands Tony finally gets a good look at Bucky\u2019s back. \r</p><p>The mass of scars that spider out over his shoulder in a kind of morbid maze immediately drew Tony\u2019s eye. As Tony gently washed out all the dirt from the area, making sure the skin around the metal wasn\u2019t aggravated or inflamed, he realised how smiler the mess looks compared to Tony\u2019s own scars on his chest. Both scars stood as symbols of just what they had both survived. The trials they had faced in life that helped to mould who they are today. \r</p><p>Tearing his eyes from Bucky\u2019s shoulder, when he felt his shoulders tense a bit, obviously aware of what Tony was looking at. Tony got started on washing away the rest of the dirt. Each patch cleaned revealed more scars, most of them old- obviously from his Winter Soldier days. back from the days, the Soldier had fewer qualms about injuring the body and only focused on finishing the job. Scars from the tests the Hydra scientists put him through or used him as a shield. \r</p><p>Finally finishing the back, Tony taps Bucky\u2019s shoulder, \u201cturn around please?\u201d Looking up, Tony\u2019s eyes again catches Bucky\u2019s. A guarded look had come over his eyes, as Bucky had felt Tony finding more and more scars. There as also an odd sort of vulnerability in Bucky\u2019 face a well, as he had let Tony take them all in. \r</p><p>Looking into Tony\u2019s eyes, Bucky could see a similar look in his, along with understanding. They both had too many scars to count, all from various things such as stupid childhood stunts to accidents to battle inflicted wound. They both had scars that weren\u2019t visible to the naked eye. \r</p><p>The contact was broken as the water pipes spluttered for a moment, the water turning a bit colder before heating again. It was enough to cause Tony to jump, breaking the eye contact between them. After a brief pause, they both chuckled a bit. Tony\u2019s head still floating a bit but not deeply.\r</p><p>\u201cNearly finished Terminator ok? I\u2019ll have you smelling of roses in no time,\u201d Grinning cheekily, Tony starts on washing the front of Bucky\u2019 body, using quick efficient strokes, the dirt was soon being washed away down the drain. Tony took his time though to carefully clean the metal arm. Working away as much grime as he could, for now, already the arm was moving better as gunk was cleaned from between the plates. \r</p><p>They both shampooed their hair twice to get it feeling clean again, each helping the other, playful teasing between them as Tony leant his forehead on Bucky\u2019s chest. Eyes closed as Bucky\u2019 magic fingers worked out knots in Tony\u2019s hair. \r</p><p>\u201cDamn, Tony you finally smell like a real boy and not a rust bucket filled with stagnant water,\u201d \r</p><p>\u201cThank you Snowflake for that oh so wonderful compliment. Really warms my heart,\u201d snorting Tony shook his head as the last of the shampoo was washed away. He let out a surprised eep when two arms pulled him back into Bucky\u2019s chest, his nose shifting to sit behind Tony\u2019s ear. A steady breath could be heard as Bucky simply held him. \r</p><p>Relaxing, Tony leaned back into the contact and closed his eyes, letting his mind wander as they simply soaked in the other\u2019s presence and warmth. \r</p><p>Tony could feel the half hard cock resting against his thighs, that Bucky seemed content to ignore. So Tony pushed it from his mind. They were both half hard from the gently soothing touches. The intimacy making their bodies feel good but there was no urgency to get off. They were both happy to just hold one another. \r</p><p>It was too soon for anything else and they were fine with that for now, but in the darkened bathroom together, they could just be. \r</p><p>They weren\u2019t sure how long they stood there like this, soaking in the warmth of the other. Enjoying each other\u2019s company when they heard the bedroom door swing open. Jolting apart, they could hear Steve\u2019s amused tone drifting over the spray of water. They could also hear Peter\u2019s non-stop excitable chatter it wasn\u2019t long till a knock on the door came. \r</p><p>\u201cHey! It\u2019s us, is it Tony or Bucky in there? Pete needs to use the bathroom!\u201d \r</p><p>Chuckling, Bucky reached up and switched off the water, despite the pout Tony aimed at him. \u201cNone of that now, Junior needs to use the bathroom\u201d winking, Bucky ducks his head to peck a kiss on Tony\u2019s lips before slipping out of the shower stall. He grabs a towel, wrapping it around his waist securely, grabbing another he wraps it around Tony\u2019s shoulders. Unlocking the door he herds Tony out into the bedroom and pushes him gently towards a shocked Steve. \r</p><p>Peter on the other hand, barely batted an eyelid at his dad in a towel, more interested in the hot water as he caught sight of steam streaming out of the bathroom. \r</p><p>\u201cCome on squirt, your turn to use the bathroom and have a wash while you\u2019re at it. The hot water finally works!\u201d Grinning, Bucky shows the kid how to use the shower and gets him a towel ready before leaving him to it. Leaving the door open just a crack in case of emergencies. \r</p><p>Sauntering over to the other two, Bucky smirked at Steve who had yet to really close his mouth but was helping Tony dry. \r</p><p>\u201cHey Stevie, the hot water works by the way,\u201d \r</p><p>\u201cSo I can see..\u201dSteve gave Bucky an unimpressed look as Tony slapped away Steve\u2019s hands so he could go get dressed. Steve couldn\u2019t help but watch him walk away as Tony dropped his towel to grab his clothes. Blushing, Steve quickly looked away politely, instead he caught Bucky\u2019s eyes. Raising an eyebrow, Steve gave Bucky a questioning look. Shaking his head, Bucky understood what he was silently asking. If they had been playing around in the bathroom. \r</p><p>Steve nodded in understanding, smiling at him before turning to the now mostly dressed Tony. \r</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d hug you but er, your finally clean of dirt but I\u2019m still covered and I don\u2019t want to get you dirt already\u201d grinning bashfully, Steve started to undress his top layers and left them in a pile near the door to deal with later. \u201cI see you got the generator and boiler going through baby, thank you,\u201d \r</p><p>Waving a hand dismissively, Tony grabs his toolkit and motions for Bucky to sit on the bed so he can finally look the arm over. \r</p><p>\u201cMy pleasure, seriously Cap, that shower is amazing.\u201d Grinning Tony sets to work on the arm, \u201conce you\u2019re all clean we can all just cuddle for a while.\u201d Tony paused a moment to glance at Steve, \u201cI haven\u2019t heard any news from about Wade so I\u2019m guessing everything is still ok that area?\u201d \r</p><p>\u201cYeah. I saw Bruce leave the room as we came up, Wade is doing well\u201d smiling, Steve sat in an armchair, awaiting his turn. He smiled brighter as Tony seemed to sag a bit in relief at that news.\r</p><p>Things indeed were looking up. \r</p></p>",

The bottom floor was pretty much cleared earlier, however, Steve, Bucky and the Asgardian brothers quickly sweeper the place that was left to be checked. They moved fast and with little care to themselves. Just wanting to make sure this place was safe for them all to move around in without fear of something ambushing them at night. \r</p><p>Bruce and Clint had taken Wade into a separate room away from Tony and Peter, just-in-case, Wade turned. They didn\u2019t want Peter to have to see that. \r</p><p>Sam stayed with Tony and Peter and Punk the puppy, in a large lounge-like room. The room reminded Tony of his old family mansion back in New York, lavish and gaudy in the way most rich places ended up looking. Chairs covered in the best fabrics money could buy. Ugly patterns covered everything- ordinarily, Tony would be making comments about. \r</p><p>Right then though, Tony could barely manage a wrinkled nose at it all. His mind playing back the Moment Wade had revealed the bite. His own mind torturing him over what ifs. What If they had brought the kids inside with them? Would this whole thing of been avoided?\r</p><p>Mentally cursing, Tony told his brain to stop it. Taking deep breathes he forced himself to calm down. Thinking about what-ifs wasn\u2019t going to help him now. \r</p><p>If he had a lab  or any lab equipment; he and Bruce could perhaps work to make a cure. Anything to slow the effects of the bite! As it was, they were stuck with no equipment. No electricity to run said equipment on even. All they could do was wait to see if Wade was able to overcome the disease. \r</p><p>None of them had seen anyone to survive being bitten but that didn\u2019t mean it wasn\u2019t possible. They just all had to remain hopeful. \r</p><p>Upon being separated from his friend Wade, Peter had had a tantrum for a few minutes before going quiet and is currently curled up against Tony\u2019s side. \r</p><p>It was only an hour after they had settled into the longe; the sun slowly starting to sink in the sky meaning it was already mid-afternoon; when the super soldiers finally came back. Specks of blood till covered them here and there but they were unharmed which was the most important part. \r</p><p>\u201cThe mansion is cleared, all corpses have been taken outside as well. Thor and Loki are taking them outside so that we can bury them tomorrow when we have more light and to also check the grounds for any more.\u201d Slowly Steve walks over and kneels in front of Tony and the now slumbering Peter. Exhausted from the day\u2019s stress. Punk is asleep on Peter\u2019s lap, his head tucked into Peter\u2019s belly. \u201cHow is he doing?\u201d\r</p><p>Sighing softly, Tony gently runs his fingers through Peter\u2019s hair. In the peripheral of his vision, he sees Sam slip out- most likely to go loo or to check on the others. Bucky closes the door behind Sam before making his way to where they are and sits down by Peter\u2019s feet. \r</p><p>\u201cNot good, he didn\u2019t like being separated from Wade, kept shouting and screaming to see him. Then suddenly he went quiet and did this. Didn\u2019t even move one inch once he was like this, he has only just fallen asleep. Steve, what are we going to do? We can\u2019t just leave Wade to suffer.\u201d\r</p><p>Grimacing, Steve nodded as he looked at Peter. He felt the same helplessness as Tony is, they all hated the thought of leaving Wade to suffer, but none of them could bring themselves to end it either. They all held touch hope that Wade would pull through. Bucky himself even said Wade would survive; as if any other outcome was simply out of the question. Mentally wincing, Steve again wondered if they were being selfish for waiting this out, for allowing the virus to run its course. \r</p><p>\u201cWe just need to wait 24 hours, the virus should have run it\u2019s course within that time ok?\u201d Offering a small smile, Steve places a hand on Tony\u2019s knee, giving it a gentle squeeze. \r</p><p>\u201cEverything will be ok Doll, you\u2019ll see\u201d Bucky pulled a blanket around Peter and Tony to keep them warm, as the air starts to get colder the lower the sun goes. \r</p><p>Feeling better with the two Dom\u2019s back and their warm presence surrounding him, Tony allows himself to relax finally. Exhausted from today\u2019s stress and activities, he just wanted 10 minutes to recharge. Get his emotions back into order again. \r</p><p>\u201cCome on Doll lets move you and munchkin to a bed to sleep properly, you\u2019ll hurt your back sleeping there,\u201d Smiling warmly, Bucky strokes some of Tony\u2019s now longer curls away from his eyes. The strands have started to self-clean after so long of not being able to properly shower. Groaning Tony forced himself to stand once Steve picked up Peter. \r</p><p>\u201cI hate you Frosty flakes, giving us a blanket only to tell us to move\u201d Huffing playfully, Tony wraps the blanket around his sleeping son in the Blonde Dom\u2019s arms. \u201cDamn I really want a shower, remind me to find the boiler and generators in the morning\u201d \r</p><p>Growling in annoyance, Tony fiddled with the generator in the basement. Aiming to replace parts that rely on fuel to run with parts he had found within the mansion that morning and from their travels. If he can make the generator work without having to keep finding fuel for now. They can use the temporary electric as a chip to entice others to trust them. Giving Tony longer to make something like his arc reactor again to run the building on. \r</p><p> Behind him is Clint, Natasha and Bucky, who have all been tasked in keeping watch just in case. They had somehow forgotten to check for a basement when doing their first sweep of the place. Due to the doors leading down to the basement still being locked, they were hopeful that it\u2019s empty. \r</p><p>Still, Steve \u2018mother-hen\u2019 Rogers still insisted that some of the group went with. Due to the unknown danger, Peter had to stay with Steve upstairs to help dig holes in the gardens with the Asgardian brothers. Wade was still inside his room with Bruce and Sam. \r</p><p>So far Wade was doing well, only a mild fever is the only symptom to manifest since the bite. Upon learning of this and that Wade had survived the night, the tension over the mansion had lifted a bit. Hope spread through them all as they passed the 12th-hour mark- the maximum anyone has seen someone hold out before. \r</p><p>Suddenly, the generator whirred to life beneath his hands, lights flickering on above them. \r</p><p>\u201cYay!\u201d Grinning, Tony pats the top of the large generator fondly. \u201cGood girl sweetie, that\u2019s better huh? I\u2019ll make you better soon, promise\u201d \r</p><p>Snorting with amusement Clint leant against the side of a wine rack, arms folded across his chest. If there was anything down here, it would have found them by now. \r</p><p>\u201cYou know that\u2019s not your baby right Tones?\u201d \r</p><p>Gasping in mock horror, Tony put his hand over a fan vent quickly, \u201cHush! She will hear you! Don\u2019t listen to the silly Dom baby girl!\u201d \r</p><p>Laughing, Clint shook his head as they moved over to where the boiler sat. Checking in to see if it is working. Oh, it would be bliss to have showers again. \r</p><p>A quick check and fiddling around with the boiler and Tony declared it working. Places this far out and this big usually ran on its own system. Hopefully, the water would last. At least long enough for them to make a working renewable system. \r</p><p>\u201dThere we go, \u201d grinning, Tony stands up stretching out his muscles that have cramped up a bit from being in one position for so long. \u201cLet\u2019s go upstairs and let the others know the good knees huh?\u201d \r</p><p>Clapping his hands together the group leave the basement, taking a few bottles with them for later. For once, things were looking good for them all. Wade looks to be handling the virus well, they have a stable (for now) home with many rooms to hide and use. Bruce and Tony have talked already a little bit about making a lab here. A place where they can tend to their wounded better. \r</p><p>Upstairs, Clint and Natasha split to go to take over for Bruce and Sam. And to test the showers. \r</p><p>\u201cWanna go test the showers doll? I bet we both could use a good soaking in hot water\u201d Chuckling, Bucky winks at Tony as he directs Tony towards their rooms. \r</p><p>\u201cOh god, a hot shower sounds so good right now\u2026wait, together?\u201d Pausing Tony turns his head to look at Bucky from over his shoulder. To his credit, Bucky did actually blush a bit as he seems to think about what he just said. \r</p><p>\u201cIf you want to that is? It wouldn\u2019t be sexual, doesn\u2019t have to be sexual. I just want to relax together for a bit. Maybe soak in a warm bath after getting the dirt off?\u201d Bucky tilts his head to the side and down a bit in a bashful way. At odds with his charming smile that could charm a siren to let a ship pass by. \r</p><p>The exact same smile Tony had seen countless times on history reels from the war. In the photos displayed in exhibits at the museums. A smile that, Tony had fantasied much more about as a child than most teenage boys ought to. Dreamt of it being aimed at him when he did something good or did something that amused Barnes. Having that very same smile aimed at him, was phenomenal.\r</p><p>Despite seeing it several times already, it was still hard for Tony to believe that Bucky would aim this smile at him. \r</p><p>Looking over Bucky\u2019s face, Tony looked for anything that would indicate that Bucky is lying. He only found sincerity. A tension, that Tony wasn\u2019t even aware of, left his muscles. \r</p><p>Mentally, Tony mulled over this for a few moments, did he want to shower with Bucky? Oh god yes. However, was he ready to? It hasn\u2019t been long that they had talked about being a three-way back at the last house, after the talk they have shared the same room but not slept on the same bed. The dom\u2019s had seemed content to move at a slow pace for Tony. Letting him control the situation for now, which Tony was very grateful for actually. \r</p><p>Like now, Bucky was letting Tony decide if they moved forward or waited. Giving Tony the power, the freedom to choose. This more than anything, was what helped Tony make his decision, knowing that Bucky would keep his word as well helped. Plus, Tony really really wanted to see that body and booty!\r</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love a soak after, that is if the hot water works. Come on let\u2019s go before the child senses that I\u2019m relaxing\u201d grinning Tony takes Bucky\u2019s hand tugging him again to get moving. \u201cHonestly, kids seem to have a sixth sense for this sort of thing I swear,\u201d \r</p><p>Chuckling, Bucky allows the Sub to drag him along to the bedroom, through to the bathroom that\u2019s attached to the bedroom. Private and risk-free of anyone accidentally walking in. \r</p><p>Still, Bucky locks the door behind them, in case if Peter comes running up he assures Tony when he asks. \r</p><p>The bathroom was dim despite the midday sunlight outside. The windows were small and high up, covered in ivy that spanned the entire wall outside. The bathroom looked smaller and less daunting in the low light. The spacious tub that\u2019s sunken into the floor looked more inviting to relax than some mini swimming pool. Tony liked it, as he took off his jacket and slung it over a clothes railing. Turning around he saw Bucky struggling with his own jacket. The metal arm seemed to be paining him a bit as Bucky tried to get it off. \r</p><p>Quickly, Tony moves over to him, Gently placing a hand on Bucky\u2019s shoulder to still his metal arm, turning Bucky to face him Tony quickly undid the buttons with deft fingers. Carefully and gently, Tony eased the jacket off, murmuring to himself to check it over once their clean and he can see the arm properly. \r</p><p>Without much thought, Tony kept helping Bucky undress. Easing the shirt up and off before kneeling down, so that he could easily access the belt buckle. Easing it out carefully so that the buckle doesn\u2019t hit either of them. Standing again, Tony undoes Bucky \u2019s trousers and pushes both the trousers and the boxers underneath down so that Bucky could kick them off. Before that though, Bucky needed his boots undone so he could get them off first. Noticing this, Tony knelt and carefully undid both boots before pulling them off with one hand while the other held onto Bucky, helping him keep his balance. \r</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until Tony finally stood after helping Bucky undress that he realised what he had done. Blinking to himself, Tony had just willingly kneeled for a Dom for the first time in years. Had done one of the most basic of things, expected of Subs before he had really thought about it. \r</p><p>Giving his head a small shake, Tony decided to ignore the last 2 minutes he goes to start undressing. \r</p><p>\u201cLet me help Doll,\u201d Softly, Bucky murmured as he moves to get in front of Tony. Gently and slowly, so as to not alarm or startled Tony maybe, Bucky uses his good arm and hand to unbutton his shirt. Efficiently yet gently Bucky removes bit by bit. Something not many Dom\u2019s in Tony\u2019s experience had been willing to do.\r</p><p>Many had seen sub service actions beneath them and purely a Sub trait, Tony had only heard of Dom\u2019s willing to serve their Sub\u2019s in articles online or in rumours. \r</p><p>Deciding not to dwell on it, Tony just stayed still, only moving when prompted and enjoyed being looked after for a few moments. Just this simple act of kindness made him relax more in Bucky\u2019s presence. \r</p><p>For the first time in years, Tony could feel the start of a sub drop creep on him. A gentle soothing sensation that made him feel soft and fuzzy. For once, it wasn\u2019t being met with resistance. Tony didn\u2019t want to resist this time, he actually felt safe enough to allow it to wash over him a bit. \r</p><p>Tony never thought he would welcome the day where he could still sink into a sub drop. \r</p><p>Belatedly, Tony heard Bucky murmur to him and gesturing for him to sit on the toilet seat, as he starts the shower to test the water. Idly, Tony watches Bucky test the temperature, grinning sleepily when Bucky cheered as it actually heated up. \r</p><p>\u201cCome on doll lets get in. You\u2019ll feel better once clean I promise.\u201d Smiling softly, Bucky urges Tony to stand and move to the spacious shower. Smaller than Tony\u2019s old custom one back in Malibu when he lived there, but still large enough to move about comfortably in. \r</p><p>The moment the hot water touched Tony\u2019s body, he immediately slumped into the spray with a groan. The water felt heavenly on his aching muscles. Distantly, Tony heard an amused chuckle behind him as Bucky reached for the soap. \r</p><p>Tony startled a bit as he felt soaped hands start to wash him off, of all the grime that had stuck to him. Bucky\u2019s hands were sure but quick as they scrubbed away, allowing Tony to float a bit in his head. Enjoying the warmth of the shower as steam rose. Adding an extra blanket of warmth that wraps around his senses. \r</p><p>Detaching the shower head, Bucky quickly rinsed Tony off before returning it and gently nudges out of the way. Murmuring to Tony that he won\u2019t take to long to wash and then Tony could get back under it. \r</p><p>Coming back a bit to his senses, Tony moves to the side but also takes the soap from Bucky\u2019s hands. \r</p><p>\u201cLet me help you, James, Your arm isn\u2019t looking to good ok?\u201d \r</p><p>With a grateful smile, Bucky catches Tony\u2019s eye and nods at him before turning to give Tony his back. Quickly soaping up his hands Tony finally gets a good look at Bucky\u2019s back. \r</p><p>The mass of scars that spider out over his shoulder in a kind of morbid maze immediately drew Tony\u2019s eye. As Tony gently washed out all the dirt from the area, making sure the skin around the metal wasn\u2019t aggravated or inflamed, he realised how smiler the mess looks compared to Tony\u2019s own scars on his chest. Both scars stood as symbols of just what they had both survived. The trials they had faced in life that helped to mould who they are today. \r</p><p>Tearing his eyes from Bucky\u2019s shoulder, when he felt his shoulders tense a bit, obviously aware of what Tony was looking at. Tony got started on washing away the rest of the dirt. Each patch cleaned revealed more scars, most of them old- obviously from his Winter Soldier days. back from the days, the Soldier had fewer qualms about injuring the body and only focused on finishing the job. Scars from the tests the Hydra scientists put him through or used him as a shield. \r</p><p>Finally finishing the back, Tony taps Bucky\u2019s shoulder, \u201cturn around please?\u201d Looking up, Tony\u2019s eyes again catches Bucky\u2019s. A guarded look had come over his eyes, as Bucky had felt Tony finding more and more scars. There as also an odd sort of vulnerability in Bucky\u2019 face a well, as he had let Tony take them all in. \r</p><p>Looking into Tony\u2019s eyes, Bucky could see a similar look in his, along with understanding. They both had too many scars to count, all from various things such as stupid childhood stunts to accidents to battle inflicted wound. They both had scars that weren\u2019t visible to the naked eye. \r</p><p>The contact was broken as the water pipes spluttered for a moment, the water turning a bit colder before heating again. It was enough to cause Tony to jump, breaking the eye contact between them. After a brief pause, they both chuckled a bit. Tony\u2019s head still floating a bit but not deeply.\r</p><p>\u201cNearly finished Terminator ok? I\u2019ll have you smelling of roses in no time,\u201d Grinning cheekily, Tony starts on washing the front of Bucky\u2019 body, using quick efficient strokes, the dirt was soon being washed away down the drain. Tony took his time though to carefully clean the metal arm. Working away as much grime as he could, for now, already the arm was moving better as gunk was cleaned from between the plates. \r</p><p>They both shampooed their hair twice to get it feeling clean again, each helping the other, playful teasing between them as Tony leant his forehead on Bucky\u2019s chest. Eyes closed as Bucky\u2019 magic fingers worked out knots in Tony\u2019s hair. \r</p><p>\u201cDamn, Tony you finally smell like a real boy and not a rust bucket filled with stagnant water,\u201d \r</p><p>\u201cThank you Snowflake for that oh so wonderful compliment. Really warms my heart,\u201d snorting Tony shook his head as the last of the shampoo was washed away. He let out a surprised eep when two arms pulled him back into Bucky\u2019s chest, his nose shifting to sit behind Tony\u2019s ear. A steady breath could be heard as Bucky simply held him. \r</p><p>Relaxing, Tony leaned back into the contact and closed his eyes, letting his mind wander as they simply soaked in the other\u2019s presence and warmth. \r</p><p>Tony could feel the half hard cock resting against his thighs, that Bucky seemed content to ignore. So Tony pushed it from his mind. They were both half hard from the gently soothing touches. The intimacy making their bodies feel good but there was no urgency to get off. They were both happy to just hold one another. \r</p><p>It was too soon for anything else and they were fine with that for now, but in the darkened bathroom together, they could just be. \r</p><p>They weren\u2019t sure how long they stood there like this, soaking in the warmth of the other. Enjoying each other\u2019s company when they heard the bedroom door swing open. Jolting apart, they could hear Steve\u2019s amused tone drifting over the spray of water. They could also hear Peter\u2019s non-stop excitable chatter it wasn\u2019t long till a knock on the door came. \r</p><p>\u201cHey! It\u2019s us, is it Tony or Bucky in there? Pete needs to use the bathroom!\u201d \r</p><p>Chuckling, Bucky reached up and switched off the water, despite the pout Tony aimed at him. \u201cNone of that now, Junior needs to use the bathroom\u201d winking, Bucky ducks his head to peck a kiss on Tony\u2019s lips before slipping out of the shower stall. He grabs a towel, wrapping it around his waist securely, grabbing another he wraps it around Tony\u2019s shoulders. Unlocking the door he herds Tony out into the bedroom and pushes him gently towards a shocked Steve. \r</p><p>Peter on the other hand, barely batted an eyelid at his dad in a towel, more interested in the hot water as he caught sight of steam streaming out of the bathroom. \r</p><p>\u201cCome on squirt, your turn to use the bathroom and have a wash while you\u2019re at it. The hot water finally works!\u201d Grinning, Bucky shows the kid how to use the shower and gets him a towel ready before leaving him to it. Leaving the door open just a crack in case of emergencies. \r</p><p>Sauntering over to the other two, Bucky smirked at Steve who had yet to really close his mouth but was helping Tony dry. \r</p><p>\u201cHey Stevie, the hot water works by the way,\u201d \r</p><p>\u201cSo I can see..\u201dSteve gave Bucky an unimpressed look as Tony slapped away Steve\u2019s hands so he could go get dressed. Steve couldn\u2019t help but watch him walk away as Tony dropped his towel to grab his clothes. Blushing, Steve quickly looked away politely, instead he caught Bucky\u2019s eyes. Raising an eyebrow, Steve gave Bucky a questioning look. Shaking his head, Bucky understood what he was silently asking. If they had been playing around in the bathroom. \r</p><p>Steve nodded in understanding, smiling at him before turning to the now mostly dressed Tony. \r</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d hug you but er, your finally clean of dirt but I\u2019m still covered and I don\u2019t want to get you dirt already\u201d grinning bashfully, Steve started to undress his top layers and left them in a pile near the door to deal with later. \u201cI see you got the generator and boiler going through baby, thank you,\u201d \r</p><p>Waving a hand dismissively, Tony grabs his toolkit and motions for Bucky to sit on the bed so he can finally look the arm over. \r</p><p>\u201cMy pleasure, seriously Cap, that shower is amazing.\u201d Grinning Tony sets to work on the arm, \u201conce you\u2019re all clean we can all just cuddle for a while.\u201d Tony paused a moment to glance at Steve, \u201cI haven\u2019t heard any news from about Wade so I\u2019m guessing everything is still ok that area?\u201d \r</p><p>\u201cYeah. I saw Bruce leave the room as we came up, Wade is doing well\u201d smiling, Steve sat in an armchair, awaiting his turn. He smiled brighter as Tony seemed to sag a bit in relief at that news.\r</p><p>Things indeed were looking up. \r</p></p>",

The bottom floor was pretty much cleared earlier, however, Steve, Bucky and the Asgardian brothers quickly sweeper the place that was left to be checked. They moved fast and with little care to themselves. Just wanting to make sure this place was safe for them all to move around in without fear of something ambushing them at night. \r</p><p>Bruce and Clint had taken Wade into a separate room away from Tony and Peter, just-in-case, Wade turned. They didn&rsquo;t want Peter to have to see that. \r</p><p>Sam stayed with Tony and Peter and Punk the puppy, in a large lounge-like room. The room reminded Tony of his old family mansion back in New York, lavish and gaudy in the way most rich places ended up looking. Chairs covered in the best fabrics money could buy. Ugly patterns covered everything- ordinarily, Tony would be making comments about. \r</p><p>Right then though, Tony could barely manage a wrinkled nose at it all. His mind playing back the Moment Wade had revealed the bite. His own mind torturing him over what ifs. What If they had brought the kids inside with them? Would this whole thing of been avoided?\r</p><p>Mentally cursing, Tony told his brain to stop it. Taking deep breathes he forced himself to calm down. Thinking about what-ifs wasn&rsquo;t going to help him now. \r</p><p>If he had a lab  or any lab equipment; he and Bruce could perhaps work to make a cure. Anything to slow the effects of the bite! As it was, they were stuck with no equipment. No electricity to run said equipment on even. All they could do was wait to see if Wade was able to overcome the disease. \r</p><p>None of them had seen anyone to survive being bitten but that didn&rsquo;t mean it wasn&rsquo;t possible. They just all had to remain hopeful. \r</p><p>Upon being separated from his friend Wade, Peter had had a tantrum for a few minutes before going quiet and is currently curled up against Tony&rsquo;s side. \r</p><p>It was only an hour after they had settled into the longe; the sun slowly starting to sink in the sky meaning it was already mid-afternoon; when the super soldiers finally came back. Specks of blood till covered them here and there but they were unharmed which was the most important part. \r</p><p>&ldquo;The mansion is cleared, all corpses have been taken outside as well. Thor and Loki are taking them outside so that we can bury them tomorrow when we have more light and to also check the grounds for any more.&rdquo; Slowly Steve walks over and kneels in front of Tony and the now slumbering Peter. Exhausted from the day&rsquo;s stress. Punk is asleep on Peter&rsquo;s lap, his head tucked into Peter&rsquo;s belly. &ldquo;How is he doing?&rdquo;\r</p><p>Sighing softly, Tony gently runs his fingers through Peter&rsquo;s hair. In the peripheral of his vision, he sees Sam slip out- most likely to go loo or to check on the others. Bucky closes the door behind Sam before making his way to where they are and sits down by Peter&rsquo;s feet. \r</p><p>&ldquo;Not good, he didn&rsquo;t like being separated from Wade, kept shouting and screaming to see him. Then suddenly he went quiet and did this. Didn&rsquo;t even move one inch once he was like this, he has only just fallen asleep. Steve, what are we going to do? We can&rsquo;t just leave Wade to suffer.&rdquo;\r</p><p>Grimacing, Steve nodded as he looked at Peter. He felt the same helplessness as Tony is, they all hated the thought of leaving Wade to suffer, but none of them could bring themselves to end it either. They all held touch hope that Wade would pull through. Bucky himself even said Wade would survive; as if any other outcome was simply out of the question. Mentally wincing, Steve again wondered if they were being selfish for waiting this out, for allowing the virus to run its course. \r</p><p>&ldquo;We just need to wait 24 hours, the virus should have run it&rsquo;s course within that time ok?&rdquo; Offering a small smile, Steve places a hand on Tony&rsquo;s knee, giving it a gentle squeeze. \r</p><p>&ldquo;Everything will be ok Doll, you&rsquo;ll see&rdquo; Bucky pulled a blanket around Peter and Tony to keep them warm, as the air starts to get colder the lower the sun goes. \r</p><p>Feeling better with the two Dom&rsquo;s back and their warm presence surrounding him, Tony allows himself to relax finally. Exhausted from today&rsquo;s stress and activities, he just wanted 10 minutes to recharge. Get his emotions back into order again. \r</p><p>&ldquo;Come on Doll lets move you and munchkin to a bed to sleep properly, you&rsquo;ll hurt your back sleeping there,&rdquo; Smiling warmly, Bucky strokes some of Tony&rsquo;s now longer curls away from his eyes. The strands have started to self-clean after so long of not being able to properly shower. Groaning Tony forced himself to stand once Steve picked up Peter. \r</p><p>&ldquo;I hate you Frosty flakes, giving us a blanket only to tell us to move&rdquo; Huffing playfully, Tony wraps the blanket around his sleeping son in the Blonde Dom&rsquo;s arms. &ldquo;Damn I really want a shower, remind me to find the boiler and generators in the morning&rdquo; \r</p><p>Growling in annoyance, Tony fiddled with the generator in the basement. Aiming to replace parts that rely on fuel to run with parts he had found within the mansion that morning and from their travels. If he can make the generator work without having to keep finding fuel for now. They can use the temporary electric as a chip to entice others to trust them. Giving Tony longer to make something like his arc reactor again to run the building on. \r</p><p> Behind him is Clint, Natasha and Bucky, who have all been tasked in keeping watch just in case. They had somehow forgotten to check for a basement when doing their first sweep of the place. Due to the doors leading down to the basement still being locked, they were hopeful that it&rsquo;s empty. \r</p><p>Still, Steve &lsquo;mother-hen&rsquo; Rogers still insisted that some of the group went with. Due to the unknown danger, Peter had to stay with Steve upstairs to help dig holes in the gardens with the Asgardian brothers. Wade was still inside his room with Bruce and Sam. \r</p><p>So far Wade was doing well, only a mild fever is the only symptom to manifest since the bite. Upon learning of this and that Wade had survived the night, the tension over the mansion had lifted a bit. Hope spread through them all as they passed the 12th-hour mark- the maximum anyone has seen someone hold out before. \r</p><p>Suddenly, the generator whirred to life beneath his hands, lights flickering on above them. \r</p><p>&ldquo;Yay!&rdquo; Grinning, Tony pats the top of the large generator fondly. &ldquo;Good girl sweetie, that&rsquo;s better huh? I&rsquo;ll make you better soon, promise&rdquo; \r</p><p>Snorting with amusement Clint leant against the side of a wine rack, arms folded across his chest. If there was anything down here, it would have found them by now. \r</p><p>&ldquo;You know that&rsquo;s not your baby right Tones?&rdquo; \r</p><p>Gasping in mock horror, Tony put his hand over a fan vent quickly, &ldquo;Hush! She will hear you! Don&rsquo;t listen to the silly Dom baby girl!&rdquo; \r</p><p>Laughing, Clint shook his head as they moved over to where the boiler sat. Checking in to see if it is working. Oh, it would be bliss to have showers again. \r</p><p>A quick check and fiddling around with the boiler and Tony declared it working. Places this far out and this big usually ran on its own system. Hopefully, the water would last. At least long enough for them to make a working renewable system. \r</p><p>&rdquo;There we go, &rdquo; grinning, Tony stands up stretching out his muscles that have cramped up a bit from being in one position for so long. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go upstairs and let the others know the good knees huh?&rdquo; \r</p><p>Clapping his hands together the group leave the basement, taking a few bottles with them for later. For once, things were looking good for them all. Wade looks to be handling the virus well, they have a stable (for now) home with many rooms to hide and use. Bruce and Tony have talked already a little bit about making a lab here. A place where they can tend to their wounded better. \r</p><p>Upstairs, Clint and Natasha split to go to take over for Bruce and Sam. And to test the showers. \r</p><p>&ldquo;Wanna go test the showers doll? I bet we both could use a good soaking in hot water&rdquo; Chuckling, Bucky winks at Tony as he directs Tony towards their rooms. \r</p><p>&ldquo;Oh god, a hot shower sounds so good right now&hellip;wait, together?&rdquo; Pausing Tony turns his head to look at Bucky from over his shoulder. To his credit, Bucky did actually blush a bit as he seems to think about what he just said. \r</p><p>&ldquo;If you want to that is? It wouldn&rsquo;t be sexual, doesn&rsquo;t have to be sexual. I just want to relax together for a bit. Maybe soak in a warm bath after getting the dirt off?&rdquo; Bucky tilts his head to the side and down a bit in a bashful way. At odds with his charming smile that could charm a siren to let a ship pass by. \r</p><p>The exact same smile Tony had seen countless times on history reels from the war. In the photos displayed in exhibits at the museums. A smile that, Tony had fantasied much more about as a child than most teenage boys ought to. Dreamt of it being aimed at him when he did something good or did something that amused Barnes. Having that very same smile aimed at him, was phenomenal.\r</p><p>Despite seeing it several times already, it was still hard for Tony to believe that Bucky would aim this smile at him. \r</p><p>Looking over Bucky&rsquo;s face, Tony looked for anything that would indicate that Bucky is lying. He only found sincerity. A tension, that Tony wasn&rsquo;t even aware of, left his muscles. \r</p><p>Mentally, Tony mulled over this for a few moments, did he want to shower with Bucky? Oh god yes. However, was he ready to? It hasn&rsquo;t been long that they had talked about being a three-way back at the last house, after the talk they have shared the same room but not slept on the same bed. The dom&rsquo;s had seemed content to move at a slow pace for Tony. Letting him control the situation for now, which Tony was very grateful for actually. \r</p><p>Like now, Bucky was letting Tony decide if they moved forward or waited. Giving Tony the power, the freedom to choose. This more than anything, was what helped Tony make his decision, knowing that Bucky would keep his word as well helped. Plus, Tony really really wanted to see that body and booty!\r</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d love a soak after, that is if the hot water works. Come on let&rsquo;s go before the child senses that I&rsquo;m relaxing&rdquo; grinning Tony takes Bucky&rsquo;s hand tugging him again to get moving. &ldquo;Honestly, kids seem to have a sixth sense for this sort of thing I swear,&rdquo; \r</p><p>Chuckling, Bucky allows the Sub to drag him along to the bedroom, through to the bathroom that&rsquo;s attached to the bedroom. Private and risk-free of anyone accidentally walking in. \r</p><p>Still, Bucky locks the door behind them, in case if Peter comes running up he assures Tony when he asks. \r</p><p>The bathroom was dim despite the midday sunlight outside. The windows were small and high up, covered in ivy that spanned the entire wall outside. The bathroom looked smaller and less daunting in the low light. The spacious tub that&rsquo;s sunken into the floor looked more inviting to relax than some mini swimming pool. Tony liked it, as he took off his jacket and slung it over a clothes railing. Turning around he saw Bucky struggling with his own jacket. The metal arm seemed to be paining him a bit as Bucky tried to get it off. \r</p><p>Quickly, Tony moves over to him, Gently placing a hand on Bucky&rsquo;s shoulder to still his metal arm, turning Bucky to face him Tony quickly undid the buttons with deft fingers. Carefully and gently, Tony eased the jacket off, murmuring to himself to check it over once their clean and he can see the arm properly. \r</p><p>Without much thought, Tony kept helping Bucky undress. Easing the shirt up and off before kneeling down, so that he could easily access the belt buckle. Easing it out carefully so that the buckle doesn&rsquo;t hit either of them. Standing again, Tony undoes Bucky &rsquo;s trousers and pushes both the trousers and the boxers underneath down so that Bucky could kick them off. Before that though, Bucky needed his boots undone so he could get them off first. Noticing this, Tony knelt and carefully undid both boots before pulling them off with one hand while the other held onto Bucky, helping him keep his balance. \r</p><p>It wasn&rsquo;t until Tony finally stood after helping Bucky undress that he realised what he had done. Blinking to himself, Tony had just willingly kneeled for a Dom for the first time in years. Had done one of the most basic of things, expected of Subs before he had really thought about it. \r</p><p>Giving his head a small shake, Tony decided to ignore the last 2 minutes he goes to start undressing. \r</p><p>&ldquo;Let me help Doll,&rdquo; Softly, Bucky murmured as he moves to get in front of Tony. Gently and slowly, so as to not alarm or startled Tony maybe, Bucky uses his good arm and hand to unbutton his shirt. Efficiently yet gently Bucky removes bit by bit. Something not many Dom&rsquo;s in Tony&rsquo;s experience had been willing to do.\r</p><p>Many had seen sub service actions beneath them and purely a Sub trait, Tony had only heard of Dom&rsquo;s willing to serve their Sub&rsquo;s in articles online or in rumours. \r</p><p>Deciding not to dwell on it, Tony just stayed still, only moving when prompted and enjoyed being looked after for a few moments. Just this simple act of kindness made him relax more in Bucky&rsquo;s presence. \r</p><p>For the first time in years, Tony could feel the start of a sub drop creep on him.

Tony didn&rsquo;t want to resist this time, he actually felt safe enough to allow it to wash over him a bit. \r</p><p>Tony never thought he would welcome the day where he could still sink into a sub drop. \r</p><p>Belatedly, Tony heard Bucky murmur to him and gesturing for him to sit on the toilet seat, as he starts the shower to test the water. Idly, Tony watches Bucky test the temperature, grinning sleepily when Bucky cheered as it actually heated up. \r</p><p>&ldquo;Come on doll lets get in. You&rsquo;ll feel better once clean I promise.&rdquo; Smiling softly, Bucky urges Tony to stand and move to the spacious shower. Smaller than Tony&rsquo;s old custom one back in Malibu when he lived there, but still large enough to move about comfortably in. \r</p><p>The moment the hot water touched Tony&rsquo;s body, he immediately slumped into the spray with a groan. The water felt heavenly on his aching muscles. Distantly, Tony heard an amused chuckle behind him as Bucky reached for the soap. \r</p><p>Tony startled a bit as he felt soaped hands start to wash him off, of all the grime that had stuck to him. Bucky&rsquo;s hands were sure but quick as they scrubbed away, allowing Tony to float a bit in his head. Enjoying the warmth of the shower as steam rose. Adding an extra blanket of warmth that wraps around his senses. \r</p><p>Detaching the shower head, Bucky quickly rinsed Tony off before returning it and gently nudges out of the way. Murmuring to Tony that he won&rsquo;t take to long to wash and then Tony could get back under it. \r</p><p>Coming back a bit to his senses, Tony moves to the side but also takes the soap from Bucky&rsquo;s hands. \r</p><p>&ldquo;Let me help you, James, Your arm isn&rsquo;t looking to good ok?&rdquo; \r</p><p>With a grateful smile, Bucky catches Tony&rsquo;s eye and nods at him before turning to give Tony his back. Quickly soaping up his hands Tony finally gets a good look at Bucky&rsquo;s back. \r</p><p>The mass of scars that spider out over his shoulder in a kind of morbid maze immediately drew Tony&rsquo;s eye. As Tony gently washed out all the dirt from the area, making sure the skin around the metal wasn&rsquo;t aggravated or inflamed, he realised how smiler the mess looks compared to Tony&rsquo;s own scars on his chest. Both scars stood as symbols of just what they had both survived. The trials they had faced in life that helped to mould who they are today. \r</p><p>Tearing his eyes from Bucky&rsquo;s shoulder, when he felt his shoulders tense a bit, obviously aware of what Tony was looking at. Tony got started on washing away the rest of the dirt. Each patch cleaned revealed more scars, most of them old- obviously from his Winter Soldier days. back from the days, the Soldier had fewer qualms about injuring the body and only focused on finishing the job. Scars from the tests the Hydra scientists put him through or used him as a shield. \r</p><p>Finally finishing the back, Tony taps Bucky&rsquo;s shoulder, &ldquo;turn around please?&rdquo; Looking up, Tony&rsquo;s eyes again catches Bucky&rsquo;s. A guarded look had come over his eyes, as Bucky had felt Tony finding more and more scars. There as also an odd sort of vulnerability in Bucky&rsquo; face a well, as he had let Tony take them all in. \r</p><p>Looking into Tony&rsquo;s eyes, Bucky could see a similar look in his, along with understanding. They both had too many scars to count, all from various things such as stupid childhood stunts to accidents to battle inflicted wound. They both had scars that weren&rsquo;t visible to the naked eye. \r</p><p>The contact was broken as the water pipes spluttered for a moment, the water turning a bit colder before heating again. It was enough to cause Tony to jump, breaking the eye contact between them. After a brief pause, they both chuckled a bit. Tony&rsquo;s head still floating a bit but not deeply.\r</p><p>&ldquo;Nearly finished Terminator ok? I&rsquo;ll have you smelling of roses in no time,&rdquo; Grinning cheekily, Tony starts on washing the front of Bucky&rsquo; body, using quick efficient strokes, the dirt was soon being washed away down the drain. Tony took his time though to carefully clean the metal arm. Working away as much grime as he could, for now, already the arm was moving better as gunk was cleaned from between the plates. \r</p><p>They both shampooed their hair twice to get it feeling clean again, each helping the other, playful teasing between them as Tony leant his forehead on Bucky&rsquo;s chest. Eyes closed as Bucky&rsquo; magic fingers worked out knots in Tony&rsquo;s hair. \r</p><p>&ldquo;Damn, Tony you finally smell like a real boy and not a rust bucket filled with stagnant water,&rdquo; \r</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you Snowflake for that oh so wonderful compliment. Really warms my heart,&rdquo; snorting Tony shook his head as the last of the shampoo was washed away. He let out a surprised eep when two arms pulled him back into Bucky&rsquo;s chest, his nose shifting to sit behind Tony&rsquo;s ear. A steady breath could be heard as Bucky simply held him. \r</p><p>Relaxing, Tony leaned back into the contact and closed his eyes, letting his mind wander as they simply soaked in the other&rsquo;s presence and warmth. \r</p><p>Tony could feel the half hard cock resting against his thighs, that Bucky seemed content to ignore. So Tony pushed it from his mind. They were both half hard from the gently soothing touches. The intimacy making their bodies feel good but there was no urgency to get off. They were both happy to just hold one another. \r</p><p>It was too soon for anything else and they were fine with that for now, but in the darkened bathroom together, they could just be. \r</p><p>They weren&rsquo;t sure how long they stood there like this, soaking in the warmth of the other. Enjoying each other&rsquo;s company when they heard the bedroom door swing open. Jolting apart, they could hear Steve&rsquo;s amused tone drifting over the spray of water. They could also hear Peter&rsquo;s non-stop excitable chatter it wasn&rsquo;t long till a knock on the door came. \r</p><p>&ldquo;Hey! It&rsquo;s us, is it Tony or Bucky in there? Pete needs to use the bathroom!&rdquo; \r</p><p>Chuckling, Bucky reached up and switched off the water, despite the pout Tony aimed at him. &ldquo;None of that now, Junior needs to use the bathroom&rdquo; winking, Bucky ducks his head to peck a kiss on Tony&rsquo;s lips before slipping out of the shower stall. He grabs a towel, wrapping it around his waist securely, grabbing another he wraps it around Tony&rsquo;s shoulders. Unlocking the door he herds Tony out into the bedroom and pushes him gently towards a shocked Steve. \r</p><p>Peter on the other hand, barely batted an eyelid at his dad in a towel, more interested in the hot water as he caught sight of steam streaming out of the bathroom. \r</p><p>&ldquo;Come on squirt, your turn to use the bathroom and have a wash while you&rsquo;re at it. The hot water finally works!&rdquo; Grinning, Bucky shows the kid how to use the shower and gets him a towel ready before leaving him to it. Leaving the door open just a crack in case of emergencies. \r</p><p>Sauntering over to the other two, Bucky smirked at Steve who had yet to really close his mouth but was helping Tony dry. \r</p><p>&ldquo;Hey Stevie, the hot water works by the way,&rdquo; \r</p><p>&ldquo;So I can see..&rdquo;Steve gave Bucky an unimpressed look as Tony slapped away Steve&rsquo;s hands so he could go get dressed. Steve couldn&rsquo;t help but watch him walk away as Tony dropped his towel to grab his clothes. Blushing, Steve quickly looked away politely, instead he caught Bucky&rsquo;s eyes. Raising an eyebrow, Steve gave Bucky a questioning look. Shaking his head, Bucky understood what he was silently asking. If they had been playing around in the bathroom. \r</p><p>Steve nodded in understanding, smiling at him before turning to the now mostly dressed Tony. \r</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d hug you but er, your finally clean of dirt but I&rsquo;m still covered and I don&rsquo;t want to get you dirt already&rdquo; grinning bashfully, Steve started to undress his top layers and left them in a pile near the door to deal with later. &ldquo;I see you got the generator and boiler going through baby, thank you,&rdquo; \r</p><p>Waving a hand dismissively, Tony grabs his toolkit and motions for Bucky to sit on the bed so he can finally look the arm over. \r</p><p>&ldquo;My pleasure, seriously Cap, that shower is amazing.&rdquo; Grinning Tony sets to work on the arm, &ldquo;once you&rsquo;re all clean we can all just cuddle for a while.&rdquo; Tony paused a moment to glance at Steve, &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t heard any news from about Wade so I&rsquo;m guessing everything is still ok that area?&rdquo; \r</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah. I saw Bruce leave the room as we came up, Wade is doing well&rdquo; smiling, Steve sat in an armchair, awaiting his turn. He smiled brighter as Tony seemed to sag a bit in relief at that news.\r</p><p>Things indeed were looking up. \r</p></p>",

Enjoy, feedback is always appreciated and reblogs help me a lot!</i></p><p><b>\u2192summary: </b>Turns out that Tony Stark wasn\u2019t the asshole people made of him.</p><p><b>\u2192wc:</b> 3566</p><p><b>Y/</b>n followed her father through\u00a0 the building, scanning her eyes in fascination at the expensive equipment it was decorated with. Tony noticed the way her mouth hung slightly agape and he couldn\u2019t help but feel a little proud over his creation.</p><p>Every once in a while, he would stop and explain something. Describe the origin of said item or tell a funny story about another. Eventually they reached the elevators, who were entirely made out of glass, making Y/n desperatly grab onto the railing.</p><p>\u201cFRIDAY, where\u2019s Banner?\u201d Tony asked.</p><p>The woman\u2019s voice echoed in the elevator, starling Y/n once again.</p><p>\u201cMr Banner is in the laboratory\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen that\u2019s where we\u2019re going\u201d </p><p>The elevator started moving at his words and Y/n gave him a concerned look, holding a firm grip around the the metal handles.</p><p>\u201cBanner? As in Dr Bruce Banner?\u201d</p><p>Tony looked at her for a second, surprised at her knowledge.</p><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s the one\u201d</p><p>He saw her pupils widened and a small smile creeping its way onto her lips, and even though she tired to hide it, her entire face showed of the anticipation.</p><p>Tony smirked at the sight as the elevator came to a stop and he quickly got out. He opened his arms and pointed out over the room.</p><p>\u201cThis is where the magic happens\u201d</p><p>Y/n was as in a trans as she tried to take in the outstanding laboratory. It was like nothing she had ever seen before, and she had been to a fair share of labs in her lifetime.</p><p>\u201cThis is amazing\u201d she mumbled as she nearly tripped over herself, making her cheeks crimson as she desperately grabbed onto a table to keep steady. Tony gave her a small smile as he moved further into the room, Y/n tight in his heels.</p><p>In the middle of the room, there was a large hologram projected over a big table. A middle aged man with a white coat and black glasses stood leaned over it, completely focused on what he was doing.</p><p>\u201cBanner?\u201d Tony said, trying to get the man\u2019s attention.</p><p>He repeated his question as he snapped his fingers.</p><p>\u201cBanner?\u201d </p><p>The man shook his head slightly before looking at him.</p><p>\u201cOh, I didn\u2019t hear you\u201d</p><p>Tony raised his eyebrows a little.</p><p>\u201cNoticed that much\u201d</p><p>Bruce\u2019s eyes flickered from Tony to the girl standing next to him, making a wrinkle appear between his brows. </p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s this?\u201d</p><p>Y/n could barely contain her excitement, and she nervously fidgeted with the zipper on her hoodie.</p><p>\u201cThis is Y/n, my daughter\u201d Tony said casually, walking around the hologram and examining it carefully. Bruce\u2019s jaw dropped to the ground, being the third one of the day. </p><p>\u201cW- What? Tony- since when?\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently since 2001, what is this?\u201d He said, his entire attention dedicated to the hologram.</p><p>Bruce shot the girl a sceptical look before turning back to his experiment.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m working on the new airplane design we discussed, the one that was only going to run on renewable energy sources, but it\u2019s difficult to make it completely independent on fossil fuels\u201d</p><p>Tony turned on the design and stroke his chin.</p><p>\u201cWell if-\u201c</p><p>Y/n took a step forward, looking over the blueprint as well.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you just combine different energy sources? Like making it run mostly from biofuels, but adding solar panels and electricity driven motors? You need to start out small though, there isn\u2019t enough technology to make full airplane sized electric motors without making the entire city blackout. Also, you can also try taking advance of the wind, that is another very powerful energy source that you always will have access to, so the faster you fly, the more energy is created. But then you have..\u201d</p><p>She trailed of, getting lost in her head. Bruce stared at her for a second only to turn his eyes to Tony, who looked stupidly proud. </p><p>\u201cHow?-\u201c</p><p>Tony only shook his head, watching as his daughter intensely ran some math through her head, and watching her sigh happily as she figured it out.</p><p>She had been so quiet until now, where she seemed to be able to go on for eternities about what she was passionate about, and it hurt him a little seeing as she probably never had anyone to discuss these kinds of things with before.</p><p>She quickly took a piece of paper out of her black jeans and scribbled something down in a messy handwriting.</p><p>Y/n looked pleased with herself before she noticed the two people staring, and her cheeks grew a rosy color. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I just-\u201c she stuttered but was interrupted by Bruce.</p><p>\u201cNo! Don\u2019t apologize. You actually have a point\u201d </p><p>She smiled big at his sentence before she took a deep breath and a step closer to him.</p><p>\u201cDr Banner\u201d</p><p>Bruce flinched slightly at the mention of \u2018dr\u2019 as most people only called him by his first name nowadays. Or the\u00a0\u2018Hulk\u2019, which was a name he had come to dislike.</p><p>\u201cI am such a huge fan of yours and I really loved your article on anti electron collisions, oh, and the lesson you held at my university. About biochemistry and the biological process of the evolution? It was amazing!\u201d</p><p>Words and praises were falling out if Y/n\u2019s mouth like they were running water and she was a leaking tap.</p><p>Bruce was stunned, to say the least, of the seventeen year olds advanced knowledge, and he could see where she had gotten it from. Tony stood in the other end of the round table, trying to cover up the cocky smirk that clad his lips.</p><p>\u201cThank you Y/n\u201d Bruce replied with a genuine smile. He was used to getting praised but for other reasons, like turning into a green monster and saving the world from aliens, something the small girl in front of him seemed completely oblivious to.</p><p>\u201cHow come you are reading those kinds of articles? I mean, you\u2019re seventeen\u201d</p><p>Y/n shrugged her shoulder a little, feeling the increasing anxiety creep up on her.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know Dr Banner, I guess i\u2019m just naturally interested\u201d </p><p>She flashed him a nervous smile, noticing that he subject made her uncomfortable, he decided not to further pressure her.</p><p>\u201cAlright, but if you want something to do I would be happy to show you a new article I\u2019m writing on\u201d</p><p>Y/n\u2019s face lit up.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>Bruce nodded and y/n smiled so big the sides od her eyes were crinkling up.</p><p>Tony, who watched the entire thing, grew more fond of the girl by the seconds, and even though he had only known her for about three hours, she already had a special place in his heart. And he knew that if anything ever happened to her, blood would be spilt.</p><p>-</p><p>The day passed by in high speed and Y/n and her father found themselves bonding pretty quickly. They shared a lot of interests and both of them had a fascinating obsession with technology. Y/n began opening up a little to him, feeling the most comfortable she had felt since her mother passed. It was small things that crushed him a little inside like the way she was fascinated over the pool, and claiming she had never been to one. She was so innocent, yet she had been through so much. </p><p>After asking for some privacy, the rest of the avengers had left the girl and her father alone, although Tony was sure that he saw them in the corner of his eye at multiple occasions.</p><p>The clock was nearing 7 and he new that he was going to have to pop the question sooner or later.</p><p>\u201dSo\u2026\u201d</p><p>he started, making both of them stop in their tracks.</p><p>\u201dWhere are you staying?\u201d</p><p>Y/n rubbed her palms together as she felt her stomach growl of hunger.</p><p>\u201dUhm, at the Colton Centre Hotel in the city. I just kinda packed everything I had and left\u201d</p><p>Tony nodded understandingly, not wanting to pressure the fragile teenager.</p><p>\u201cWhat would you say about living here? Then you would have access to FRIDAY all the time, the lab, Bruce and.. me\u201d </p><p>Tony looked up to meet her gaze, where a smile was playing on her lips.</p><p>\u201cI would like that, and getting to know you a bit better\u201d</p><p>This time it was Tony\u2019s time to smile and he gave her a gentle pat on the shoulder before picking up his pace again.</p><p>\u201cGreat! I will have Happy pick up your bags, now let\u2019s go get some food into that system of yours\u201d</p><p>The Avengers kitchen was, as expected, huge. Tony explained that they all shared it, even though there were multiple others scattered around the building. </p><p>As they stepped of the elevator Yn could smell the pasta on the stove. Only the smell made her stomach let out loud noises and she blushed a little because of it. Loud voices were echoing between the walls and Tony sent her a worried look, asking for permission to enter the room with the avengers there, which she replied to with a small nod.</p><p>\u201cHey guys\u201d Tony said, walking confidently into the room with Y/n right behind him. The laughter died out and every pair of eyes were directed to the short girl behind him. Confusion were written over their foreheads and Tony eventually pointed to Y/n.</p><p>\u201cThis is my daughter, Y/n\u201d </p><p>Sam was about to open his mouth and leave a snarky comment but Tony sent him a death stare and hissed a low \u201cdon\u2019t\u201d his way, making him hold up his hands in surrender.</p><p>\u201dShe\u2019s seventeen and she\u2019s going to live here with us now, and no, I had no idea I had a daughter until six hours ago\u201d Tony stared intensely at Sam.</p><p>\u201cOkay, great, glad we got that out of the way. What are you cooking?\u201d He continued, walking up to Wanda who were stirring a deep read tomato sauce.</p><p>\u201cUhm, Stark\u201d Natasha said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re ready to leave the subject yet\u201d</p><p>All eyes were still on Y/n were she stood as glued to the ground, once again fidgeting with the zipper of her hoodie. </p><p>\u201cYeah Stark, this is a truck you can\u2019t stop with your suit\u201d Clint added, making Tony furrow his brows at the mans try to be clever.</p><p>Without thinking, Y/n chimed into the discussion.</p><p>\u201cActually, that should not be possible. I saw the video of the the boy dressed in red and blue tights, and a human should not be able to stop a car going 40 miles an hour. Or have telepathic abilities. It defies all laws of physics, chemistry AND biology. It should not be possible\u201d</p><p>Her eyes were quick to land on the floor again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m so sorry\u201d</p><p>She was interrupted by the blonde with the broad shoulders coming into the kitchen, holding a green apple in his hand.</p><p>\u201cYou better watch out, she\u2019s a genius\u201d</p><p>Y/n felt her cheeks getting hot as confused eyes flickered through the room.</p><p>\u201dAre you ever going to introduce us?\u201d Bucky said, getting Tony\u2019s attention.</p><p>He licked the tomato sauce of his finger before standing next to Y/n. He carefully wrapped an arm around her shoulders, looking at her for permission. She nodded slightly, enjoying the small act of affection. </p><p>\u201cMeet the avengers\u201d Tony said sarcastically and let go of the girl, making Bucky roll his eyes at him before sending her a warm smile. He got out of his chair and held out his hand, which she shook lightly with a small smile.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m James, but most people call me Bucky\u201d</p><p>He let go of her and turned around, pointing to the other people crowded around the kitchen island.</p><p>\u201cThis is Sam, he\u2019s an asshole\u201d he said, making the man smirk mischievously. Bucky put no effort into replying, instead he just continued on.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Natasha, and she\u2019s not as scary as she looks\u201d he pointed to a small woman with a cold expression on her face, making her look intimidating.</p><p>\u201cClint is the one on the stool, Wanda is cooking and the tall one over there is Thor\u201d</p><p>Y/n let out a smile.</p><p>\u201cThor? Almost as in the germanic mythology, son of Odin? The god of thunder?\u201d she said jokingly.</p><p>This caught the tall man\u2019s attention and he made his way to her with two long steps.</p><p>\u201cYes Miss Y/n. That is me\u201d</p><p>Y/n looked up to him in confusion. Disbelief written over her face.</p><p>\u201cUhm, Okay\u201d</p><p>Thor didn\u2019t like how sceptical the girl was being, and he about to reach his arm out to call on Mjolnir before Tony stopped him.</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay, we understand. You\u2019re the god of thunder and son of odin, bla bla bla\u201d</p><p>He held his pointer finger out warningly.</p><p>\u201cBut don\u2019t you break that window again, or else I will tell Loki that you are planning on betraying him\u201d</p><p>Thor let out a huff before going back to his place around the table, sending Tony evil looks behind his back.</p><p>\u201cOkay, dinners ready\u201d Wanda said, a slight accent covering her words.</p><p>As the avengers flocked around the food, Y/n remained frozen to the ground, her father next to her.</p><p>\u201cHey, kid\u201d he said, snapping her out her trans.</p><p>Her eyes met his, and she noticed the small worry wrinkle he had in his forehead.</p><p>\u201cYou alright?\u201d</p><p>Y/n nodded slightly, swallowing thickly.</p><p>\u201cJust a lot of people\u201d</p><p>Tony looked at her with kind eyes.</p><p>\u201cGrab some food and I\u2019ll show you to your room, how about that?\u201d</p><p>Y/n nodded and a wave of relief washed over her as she carefully put some pasta on her plate and drenched it in the red tomato sauce.</p><p>Tony gave her a smile as he grabbed his plate as well and went back to the elevator, Y/n following close by.</p><p>\u201cFRIDAY, take us to floor six\u201d</p><p>The elevator started moving and Y/n held a tighter grib on her plate as in a reflex.</p><p>\u201cI live on the seventh , so I\u2019m only a floor away if you need me\u201d The man started, taking a bite of pasta into his mouth. </p><p>As the elevator came to a halt, he quickly swallowed to retrain his speech ability. </p><p>\u201cThere is only two rooms here, yours and our friendly neighborhood spiderman's\u201d</p><p>As he saw the confused look on the girls face he explained further.</p><p>\u201dThe guy in red-and-blue tights catching the car\u201d</p><p>\u201dOh\u201d </p><p>Y/n said, letting the pieces fall into place. And Tony couldn\u2019t help but be a little confused at her knowledge, the one that wasn\u2019t there, about the avengers.</p><p>He unlocked the door and stood to the side, letting Y/n walk in first. The apartment was beautiful. Easily decorated like the rest of the building, but there were gold details added here and there, giving it an expensive and luxurious look.</p><p>\u201cHoly shit Tony!\u201d</p><p>She breathed out, speechless at the realization that this room, the one with the large flat screen tv and bathtub big enough to fit two of her, was in fact hers. It was more than she had ever had in her entire life, heck, the room was bigger than the houses she had lived in growing up.</p><p>Tony smiled at her, his heart growing bigger as he noticed the small things they had in common. Like the way she held her hands out when she was surprised, to the signature eye roll that Tony rocked every day. </p><p>In the eight hours he had spent together with her, knowing that he had a daughter, it was like he had become a different man. In only eight hours she had showed him a new kind of happiness and in only eight hours, he knew that he loved the girl almost running around inside of the apartment. </p><p>Meanwhile, three floors downstairs, most of the avengers were gathered in the big living room. They had all finished their dinner and were now sitting in silence.</p><p>\u201cWhat is up with Stark today?\u201d Clint finally said, breaking the icy silence.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, he is like a completely different person\u201d Sam spoke.</p><p>\u201cYou know that he haven\u2019t insulted me once since she got here\u201d Steve continued.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s almost nice\u201d Natasha said, getting the attention of the many super heroes.</p><p>\u201cWhat is that girl doing to him?\u201d Steve almost whispered, voice laced in concern.</p><p>\u201cOh, cut it out guys. He\u2019s happy. I haven\u2019t seen him like this since he and Pepper still were a thing. Let him be\u201d</p><p>Bucky pointed to Rhodey as the older man spoke.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s got a point. Plus the whiskey bottles haven\u2019t been touched since yesterday\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what do we think of her?\u201d Wanda suddenly said.</p><p>Thor grunted and they all rolled their eyes at him.</p><p>\u201cWe know! We can\u2019t believe how she doubted that you were the god of thunder and that you come from an entirely different planet!\u201d Sam added sarcastically.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s AMAZING\u201d a voice yelled from the kitchen, and into the living room came Bruce. He had a burrito in his hand and a little mayonnaise on his cheek. His glasses were sitting a little crooked on his nose and he looked like he hadn\u2019t gone outside for a week. Which he probably hadn\u2019t either.</p><p>\u201cYou know that equation I haven\u2019t been able to solve for like a week?\u201d he continued as he sat down next to Nat on the grey couch.</p><p>The avengers sighed, not wanting to be remembered of his never ending complaining about that stupid equation.</p><p>Bruce raised a brow at their reaction before going back to talking.</p><p>\u201cShe solved it in like five minutes! Steve was there!\u201d</p><p>The eyes were turned to Steve who nodded honestly.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true, she\u2019s a genius. All it took for her was a look at the board and she had it all figured out, she\u2019s a living calculator\u201d</p><p>The heroes all shared puzzled looks, not knowing what to think about the girl, as Bruce went on about some airplane he was working on. </p><p>But they had one thing clear, if she was able to stop Tony from drinking his brains out a Tuesday morning at nine am, she was worth a chance.</p><p>-</p><p>Y/n and Tony sat around the white table in her room, eating their pasta in a comfortable silence. </p><p>Y/n looked at her father as he was eating, surprised by how calm he had been about this entire thing. She had expected him to throw her out with five grand in her hand and begging her to never come back, instead he had taken her in. He wasn\u2019t at all the arrogant asshole everyone said he was, he was kind and caring and just wanted the best for everyone.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t known him for very long but she could hear her mother&rsquo;s words ringing in the back of her head. They really had a lot in common. She had his nose and defined cheekbones, and the unusual hairline.</p><p>He noticed her staring and looked up to meet her glassy eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou okay honey?\u201d</p><p>She nodded as she placed her fork on her empty plate, pushing it slightly to the side.</p><p>\u201cThank you\u201d</p><p>Tony looked at her with confusion dripping from his expression.</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d </p><p>\u201cFor this, for everything. For taking me in and showing me all these things and introducing me to all these people\u201d</p><p>The man smiled big, a genuine one that stretched out his lips.</p><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s nothing. I\u2019m just trying to provide for you and make up for all the years I\u2019ve missed of your life\u201d</p><p>Y/n returned his smile and looked down on the white table, suppressing the burning sensation behind her eyelids.</p><p>\u201cNo, but really. I\u2019m so grateful for everything and if you would have shut me out- i don\u2019t know what I would do\u201d</p><p>She swallowed thickly.</p><p>\u201cI don't\u2019 think I would still be here\u201d</p><p>Tony\u2019s smile faded as he heard the words, and even further down sunk his lips as he saw the tear roll down her cheek. She quickly wiped it away, trying to hide the fact that she was, as well as him, broken. He knew the feeling too well and knew how hard- almost hopeless it was.</p><p>He got out of his chair and sat down on the one next to her. It was like something parental kicked in, that caused him to wrap his arms around the girl and pull her tightly to his chest. She froze for a moment, before relaxing and melting into him. He held her shaking frame close, and his heart ached. She was all on her own, and had been since her mother passed. He had no idea how she had made it through, but he knew that she was strong, so strong.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be okay, just breathe alright?\u201d He said softly, feeling her chest rise and sink at his words.</p><p>\u201cSir, there is people at the door\u201d FRIDAY called out in the speakers.</p><p>\u201cNot now FRIDAY\u201d Tony said, still holding the girl in his arms.</p><p>\u201cBut Mr-\u201c</p><p>\u201cNot now\u201d He wheezed. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s an emergency sir\u201d FRIDAY spoke.</p><p>Tony sighed deeply, feeling the rage pumping through his veins. He had barely had time to be sassy, yet angry the entire day, and the feeling felt strange.</p><p>He slowly let go of Y/n, wiping a tear away from her cheek with his thumb before sending her a soft smile through gritted teeth. She let out a few soft sniffles as she wiped her nose with her sleeve, patting her eyes dry.</p><p>Tony looked up into the roof.</p><p>\u201cFRIDAY, what\u2019s the emergency?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe FBI are at the door, sir\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd they are asking for Y/n\u201d</p><p>TAG LIST: <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mkoJfC38neCKI1oYCs1Vqkg\">@writer-grace</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m5WUgXxbDJaUF5MjMIZWSrQ\">@aya-writing</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m-vK_XPk5Oj30f3U0lqEb1Q\">@bookgirlunicorn</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/muONyj81qa-C1DVY9kqiANA\">@peachesandparker</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mO-VItkOnWv68T3F4MTwmLw\">@marvelsswansong</a>\u00a0@spideynora\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mf0C8vr6Kq2xeGjmC_hHD-Q\">@britishspidey</a></p>",

Enjoy, feedback is always appreciated and reblogs help me a lot!</i></p><p><b>\u2192summary: </b>Turns out that Tony Stark wasn\u2019t the asshole people made of him.</p><p><b>\u2192wc:</b> 3566</p><p><b>Y/</b>n followed her father through\u00a0 the building, scanning her eyes in fascination at the expensive equipment it was decorated with. Tony noticed the way her mouth hung slightly agape and he couldn\u2019t help but feel a little proud over his creation.</p><p>Every once in a while, he would stop and explain something. Describe the origin of said item or tell a funny story about another. Eventually they reached the elevators, who were entirely made out of glass, making Y/n desperatly grab onto the railing.</p><p>\u201cFRIDAY, where\u2019s Banner?\u201d Tony asked.</p><p>The woman\u2019s voice echoed in the elevator, starling Y/n once again.</p><p>\u201cMr Banner is in the laboratory\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen that\u2019s where we\u2019re going\u201d </p><p>The elevator started moving at his words and Y/n gave him a concerned look, holding a firm grip around the the metal handles.</p><p>\u201cBanner? As in Dr Bruce Banner?\u201d</p><p>Tony looked at her for a second, surprised at her knowledge.</p><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s the one\u201d</p><p>He saw her pupils widened and a small smile creeping its way onto her lips, and even though she tired to hide it, her entire face showed of the anticipation.</p><p>Tony smirked at the sight as the elevator came to a stop and he quickly got out. He opened his arms and pointed out over the room.</p><p>\u201cThis is where the magic happens\u201d</p><p>Y/n was as in a trans as she tried to take in the outstanding laboratory. It was like nothing she had ever seen before, and she had been to a fair share of labs in her lifetime.</p><p>\u201cThis is amazing\u201d she mumbled as she nearly tripped over herself, making her cheeks crimson as she desperately grabbed onto a table to keep steady. Tony gave her a small smile as he moved further into the room, Y/n tight in his heels.</p><p>In the middle of the room, there was a large hologram projected over a big table. A middle aged man with a white coat and black glasses stood leaned over it, completely focused on what he was doing.</p><p>\u201cBanner?\u201d Tony said, trying to get the man\u2019s attention.</p><p>He repeated his question as he snapped his fingers.</p><p>\u201cBanner?\u201d </p><p>The man shook his head slightly before looking at him.</p><p>\u201cOh, I didn\u2019t hear you\u201d</p><p>Tony raised his eyebrows a little.</p><p>\u201cNoticed that much\u201d</p><p>Bruce\u2019s eyes flickered from Tony to the girl standing next to him, making a wrinkle appear between his brows. </p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s this?\u201d</p><p>Y/n could barely contain her excitement, and she nervously fidgeted with the zipper on her hoodie.</p><p>\u201cThis is Y/n, my daughter\u201d Tony said casually, walking around the hologram and examining it carefully. Bruce\u2019s jaw dropped to the ground, being the third one of the day. </p><p>\u201cW- What? Tony- since when?\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently since 2001, what is this?\u201d He said, his entire attention dedicated to the hologram.</p><p>Bruce shot the girl a sceptical look before turning back to his experiment.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m working on the new airplane design we discussed, the one that was only going to run on renewable energy sources, but it\u2019s difficult to make it completely independent on fossil fuels\u201d</p><p>Tony turned on the design and stroke his chin.</p><p>\u201cWell if-\u201c</p><p>Y/n took a step forward, looking over the blueprint as well.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you just combine different energy sources? Like making it run mostly from biofuels, but adding solar panels and electricity driven motors? You need to start out small though, there isn\u2019t enough technology to make full airplane sized electric motors without making the entire city blackout. Also, you can also try taking advance of the wind, that is another very powerful energy source that you always will have access to, so the faster you fly, the more energy is created. But then you have..\u201d</p><p>She trailed of, getting lost in her head. Bruce stared at her for a second only to turn his eyes to Tony, who looked stupidly proud. </p><p>\u201cHow?-\u201c</p><p>Tony only shook his head, watching as his daughter intensely ran some math through her head, and watching her sigh happily as she figured it out.</p><p>She had been so quiet until now, where she seemed to be able to go on for eternities about what she was passionate about, and it hurt him a little seeing as she probably never had anyone to discuss these kinds of things with before.</p><p>She quickly took a piece of paper out of her black jeans and scribbled something down in a messy handwriting.</p><p>Y/n looked pleased with herself before she noticed the two people staring, and her cheeks grew a rosy color. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I just-\u201c she stuttered but was interrupted by Bruce.</p><p>\u201cNo! Don\u2019t apologize. You actually have a point\u201d </p><p>She smiled big at his sentence before she took a deep breath and a step closer to him.</p><p>\u201cDr Banner\u201d</p><p>Bruce flinched slightly at the mention of \u2018dr\u2019 as most people only called him by his first name nowadays. Or the\u00a0\u2018Hulk\u2019, which was a name he had come to dislike.</p><p>\u201cI am such a huge fan of yours and I really loved your article on anti electron collisions, oh, and the lesson you held at my university. About biochemistry and the biological process of the evolution? It was amazing!\u201d</p><p>Words and praises were falling out if Y/n\u2019s mouth like they were running water and she was a leaking tap.</p><p>Bruce was stunned, to say the least, of the seventeen year olds advanced knowledge, and he could see where she had gotten it from. Tony stood in the other end of the round table, trying to cover up the cocky smirk that clad his lips.</p><p>\u201cThank you Y/n\u201d Bruce replied with a genuine smile. He was used to getting praised but for other reasons, like turning into a green monster and saving the world from aliens, something the small girl in front of him seemed completely oblivious to.</p><p>\u201cHow come you are reading those kinds of articles? I mean, you\u2019re seventeen\u201d</p><p>Y/n shrugged her shoulder a little, feeling the increasing anxiety creep up on her.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know Dr Banner, I guess i\u2019m just naturally interested\u201d </p><p>She flashed him a nervous smile, noticing that he subject made her uncomfortable, he decided not to further pressure her.</p><p>\u201cAlright, but if you want something to do I would be happy to show you a new article I\u2019m writing on\u201d</p><p>Y/n\u2019s face lit up.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>Bruce nodded and y/n smiled so big the sides od her eyes were crinkling up.</p><p>Tony, who watched the entire thing, grew more fond of the girl by the seconds, and even though he had only known her for about three hours, she already had a special place in his heart. And he knew that if anything ever happened to her, blood would be spilt.</p><p>-</p><p>The day passed by in high speed and Y/n and her father found themselves bonding pretty quickly. They shared a lot of interests and both of them had a fascinating obsession with technology. Y/n began opening up a little to him, feeling the most comfortable she had felt since her mother passed. It was small things that crushed him a little inside like the way she was fascinated over the pool, and claiming she had never been to one. She was so innocent, yet she had been through so much. </p><p>After asking for some privacy, the rest of the avengers had left the girl and her father alone, although Tony was sure that he saw them in the corner of his eye at multiple occasions.</p><p>The clock was nearing 7 and he new that he was going to have to pop the question sooner or later.</p><p>\u201dSo\u2026\u201d</p><p>he started, making both of them stop in their tracks.</p><p>\u201dWhere are you staying?\u201d</p><p>Y/n rubbed her palms together as she felt her stomach growl of hunger.</p><p>\u201dUhm, at the Colton Centre Hotel in the city. I just kinda packed everything I had and left\u201d</p><p>Tony nodded understandingly, not wanting to pressure the fragile teenager.</p><p>\u201cWhat would you say about living here? Then you would have access to FRIDAY all the time, the lab, Bruce and.. me\u201d </p><p>Tony looked up to meet her gaze, where a smile was playing on her lips.</p><p>\u201cI would like that, and getting to know you a bit better\u201d</p><p>This time it was Tony\u2019s time to smile and he gave her a gentle pat on the shoulder before picking up his pace again.</p><p>\u201cGreat! I will have Happy pick up your bags, now let\u2019s go get some food into that system of yours\u201d</p><p>The Avengers kitchen was, as expected, huge. Tony explained that they all shared it, even though there were multiple others scattered around the building. </p><p>As they stepped of the elevator Yn could smell the pasta on the stove. Only the smell made her stomach let out loud noises and she blushed a little because of it. Loud voices were echoing between the walls and Tony sent her a worried look, asking for permission to enter the room with the avengers there, which she replied to with a small nod.</p><p>\u201cHey guys\u201d Tony said, walking confidently into the room with Y/n right behind him. The laughter died out and every pair of eyes were directed to the short girl behind him. Confusion were written over their foreheads and Tony eventually pointed to Y/n.</p><p>\u201cThis is my daughter, Y/n\u201d </p><p>Sam was about to open his mouth and leave a snarky comment but Tony sent him a death stare and hissed a low \u201cdon\u2019t\u201d his way, making him hold up his hands in surrender.</p><p>\u201dShe\u2019s seventeen and she\u2019s going to live here with us now, and no, I had no idea I had a daughter until six hours ago\u201d Tony stared intensely at Sam.</p><p>\u201cOkay, great, glad we got that out of the way. What are you cooking?\u201d He continued, walking up to Wanda who were stirring a deep read tomato sauce.</p><p>\u201cUhm, Stark\u201d Natasha said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re ready to leave the subject yet\u201d</p><p>All eyes were still on Y/n were she stood as glued to the ground, once again fidgeting with the zipper of her hoodie. </p><p>\u201cYeah Stark, this is a truck you can\u2019t stop with your suit\u201d Clint added, making Tony furrow his brows at the mans try to be clever.</p><p>Without thinking, Y/n chimed into the discussion.</p><p>\u201cActually, that should not be possible. I saw the video of the the boy dressed in red and blue tights, and a human should not be able to stop a car going 40 miles an hour. Or have telepathic abilities. It defies all laws of physics, chemistry AND biology. It should not be possible\u201d</p><p>Her eyes were quick to land on the floor again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m so sorry\u201d</p><p>She was interrupted by the blonde with the broad shoulders coming into the kitchen, holding a green apple in his hand.</p><p>\u201cYou better watch out, she\u2019s a genius\u201d</p><p>Y/n felt her cheeks getting hot as confused eyes flickered through the room.</p><p>\u201dAre you ever going to introduce us?\u201d Bucky said, getting Tony\u2019s attention.</p><p>He licked the tomato sauce of his finger before standing next to Y/n. He carefully wrapped an arm around her shoulders, looking at her for permission. She nodded slightly, enjoying the small act of affection. </p><p>\u201cMeet the avengers\u201d Tony said sarcastically and let go of the girl, making Bucky roll his eyes at him before sending her a warm smile. He got out of his chair and held out his hand, which she shook lightly with a small smile.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m James, but most people call me Bucky\u201d</p><p>He let go of her and turned around, pointing to the other people crowded around the kitchen island.</p><p>\u201cThis is Sam, he\u2019s an asshole\u201d he said, making the man smirk mischievously. Bucky put no effort into replying, instead he just continued on.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Natasha, and she\u2019s not as scary as she looks\u201d he pointed to a small woman with a cold expression on her face, making her look intimidating.</p><p>\u201cClint is the one on the stool, Wanda is cooking and the tall one over there is Thor\u201d</p><p>Y/n let out a smile.</p><p>\u201cThor? Almost as in the germanic mythology, son of Odin? The god of thunder?\u201d she said jokingly.</p><p>This caught the tall man\u2019s attention and he made his way to her with two long steps.</p><p>\u201cYes Miss Y/n. That is me\u201d</p><p>Y/n looked up to him in confusion. Disbelief written over her face.</p><p>\u201cUhm, Okay\u201d</p><p>Thor didn\u2019t like how sceptical the girl was being, and he about to reach his arm out to call on Mjolnir before Tony stopped him.</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay, we understand. You\u2019re the god of thunder and son of odin, bla bla bla\u201d</p><p>He held his pointer finger out warningly.</p><p>\u201cBut don\u2019t you break that window again, or else I will tell Loki that you are planning on betraying him\u201d</p><p>Thor let out a huff before going back to his place around the table, sending Tony evil looks behind his back.</p><p>\u201cOkay, dinners ready\u201d Wanda said, a slight accent covering her words.</p><p>As the avengers flocked around the food, Y/n remained frozen to the ground, her father next to her.</p><p>\u201cHey, kid\u201d he said, snapping her out her trans.</p><p>Her eyes met his, and she noticed the small worry wrinkle he had in his forehead.</p><p>\u201cYou alright?\u201d</p><p>Y/n nodded slightly, swallowing thickly.</p><p>\u201cJust a lot of people\u201d</p><p>Tony looked at her with kind eyes.</p><p>\u201cGrab some food and I\u2019ll show you to your room, how about that?\u201d</p><p>Y/n nodded and a wave of relief washed over her as she carefully put some pasta on her plate and drenched it in the red tomato sauce.</p><p>Tony gave her a smile as he grabbed his plate as well and went back to the elevator, Y/n following close by.</p><p>\u201cFRIDAY, take us to floor six\u201d</p><p>The elevator started moving and Y/n held a tighter grib on her plate as in a reflex.</p><p>\u201cI live on the seventh , so I\u2019m only a floor away if you need me\u201d The man started, taking a bite of pasta into his mouth. </p><p>As the elevator came to a halt, he quickly swallowed to retrain his speech ability. </p><p>\u201cThere is only two rooms here, yours and our friendly neighborhood spiderman's\u201d</p><p>As he saw the confused look on the girls face he explained further.</p><p>\u201dThe guy in red-and-blue tights catching the car\u201d</p><p>\u201dOh\u201d </p><p>Y/n said, letting the pieces fall into place. And Tony couldn\u2019t help but be a little confused at her knowledge, the one that wasn\u2019t there, about the avengers.</p><p>He unlocked the door and stood to the side, letting Y/n walk in first. The apartment was beautiful. Easily decorated like the rest of the building, but there were gold details added here and there, giving it an expensive and luxurious look.</p><p>\u201cHoly shit Tony!\u201d</p><p>She breathed out, speechless at the realization that this room, the one with the large flat screen tv and bathtub big enough to fit two of her, was in fact hers. It was more than she had ever had in her entire life, heck, the room was bigger than the houses she had lived in growing up.</p><p>Tony smiled at her, his heart growing bigger as he noticed the small things they had in common. Like the way she held her hands out when she was surprised, to the signature eye roll that Tony rocked every day. </p><p>In the eight hours he had spent together with her, knowing that he had a daughter, it was like he had become a different man. In only eight hours she had showed him a new kind of happiness and in only eight hours, he knew that he loved the girl almost running around inside of the apartment. </p><p>Meanwhile, three floors downstairs, most of the avengers were gathered in the big living room. They had all finished their dinner and were now sitting in silence.</p><p>\u201cWhat is up with Stark today?\u201d Clint finally said, breaking the icy silence.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, he is like a completely different person\u201d Sam spoke.</p><p>\u201cYou know that he haven\u2019t insulted me once since she got here\u201d Steve continued.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s almost nice\u201d Natasha said, getting the attention of the many super heroes.</p><p>\u201cWhat is that girl doing to him?\u201d Steve almost whispered, voice laced in concern.</p><p>\u201cOh, cut it out guys. He\u2019s happy. I haven\u2019t seen him like this since he and Pepper still were a thing. Let him be\u201d</p><p>Bucky pointed to Rhodey as the older man spoke.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s got a point. Plus the whiskey bottles haven\u2019t been touched since yesterday\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what do we think of her?\u201d Wanda suddenly said.</p><p>Thor grunted and they all rolled their eyes at him.</p><p>\u201cWe know! We can\u2019t believe how she doubted that you were the god of thunder and that you come from an entirely different planet!\u201d Sam added sarcastically.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s AMAZING\u201d a voice yelled from the kitchen, and into the living room came Bruce. He had a burrito in his hand and a little mayonnaise on his cheek. His glasses were sitting a little crooked on his nose and he looked like he hadn\u2019t gone outside for a week. Which he probably hadn\u2019t either.</p><p>\u201cYou know that equation I haven\u2019t been able to solve for like a week?\u201d he continued as he sat down next to Nat on the grey couch.</p><p>The avengers sighed, not wanting to be remembered of his never ending complaining about that stupid equation.</p><p>Bruce raised a brow at their reaction before going back to talking.</p><p>\u201cShe solved it in like five minutes! Steve was there!\u201d</p><p>The eyes were turned to Steve who nodded honestly.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true, she\u2019s a genius. All it took for her was a look at the board and she had it all figured out, she\u2019s a living calculator\u201d</p><p>The heroes all shared puzzled looks, not knowing what to think about the girl, as Bruce went on about some airplane he was working on. </p><p>But they had one thing clear, if she was able to stop Tony from drinking his brains out a Tuesday morning at nine am, she was worth a chance.</p><p>-</p><p>Y/n and Tony sat around the white table in her room, eating their pasta in a comfortable silence. </p><p>Y/n looked at her father as he was eating, surprised by how calm he had been about this entire thing. She had expected him to throw her out with five grand in her hand and begging her to never come back, instead he had taken her in. He wasn\u2019t at all the arrogant asshole everyone said he was, he was kind and caring and just wanted the best for everyone.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t known him for very long but she could hear her mother\u2019s words ringing in the back of her head. They really had a lot in common. She had his nose and defined cheekbones, and the unusual hairline.</p><p>He noticed her staring and looked up to meet her glassy eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou okay honey?\u201d</p><p>She nodded as she placed her fork on her empty plate, pushing it slightly to the side.</p><p>\u201cThank you\u201d</p><p>Tony looked at her with confusion dripping from his expression.</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d </p><p>\u201cFor this, for everything. For taking me in and showing me all these things and introducing me to all these people\u201d</p><p>The man smiled big, a genuine one that stretched out his lips.</p><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s nothing. I\u2019m just trying to provide for you and make up for all the years I\u2019ve missed of your life\u201d</p><p>Y/n returned his smile and looked down on the white table, suppressing the burning sensation behind her eyelids.</p><p>\u201cNo, but really. I\u2019m so grateful for everything and if you would have shut me out- i don\u2019t know what I would do\u201d</p><p>She swallowed thickly.</p><p>\u201cI don't\u2019 think I would still be here\u201d</p><p>Tony\u2019s smile faded as he heard the words, and even further down sunk his lips as he saw the tear roll down her cheek. She quickly wiped it away, trying to hide the fact that she was, as well as him, broken. He knew the feeling too well and knew how hard- almost hopeless it was.</p><p>He got out of his chair and sat down on the one next to her. It was like something parental kicked in, that caused him to wrap his arms around the girl and pull her tightly to his chest. She froze for a moment, before relaxing and melting into him. He held her shaking frame close, and his heart ached. She was all on her own, and had been since her mother passed. He had no idea how she had made it through, but he knew that she was strong, so strong.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be okay, just breathe alright?\u201d He said softly, feeling her chest rise and sink at his words.</p><p>\u201cSir, there is people at the door\u201d FRIDAY called out in the speakers.</p><p>\u201cNot now FRIDAY\u201d Tony said, still holding the girl in his arms.</p><p>\u201cBut Mr-\u201c</p><p>\u201cNot now\u201d He wheezed. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s an emergency sir\u201d FRIDAY spoke.</p><p>Tony sighed deeply, feeling the rage pumping through his veins. He had barely had time to be sassy, yet angry the entire day, and the feeling felt strange.</p><p>He slowly let go of Y/n, wiping a tear away from her cheek with his thumb before sending her a soft smile through gritted teeth. She let out a few soft sniffles as she wiped her nose with her sleeve, patting her eyes dry.</p><p>Tony looked up into the roof.</p><p>\u201cFRIDAY, what\u2019s the emergency?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe FBI are at the door, sir\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd they are asking for Y/n\u201d</p><p>TAG LIST: <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mkoJfC38neCKI1oYCs1Vqkg\">@writer-grace</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m5WUgXxbDJaUF5MjMIZWSrQ\">@aya-writing</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m-vK_XPk5Oj30f3U0lqEb1Q\">@bookgirlunicorn</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/muONyj81qa-C1DVY9kqiANA\">@peachesandparker</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mO-VItkOnWv68T3F4MTwmLw\">@marvelsswansong</a>\u00a0@spideynora\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mf0C8vr6Kq2xeGjmC_hHD-Q\">@britishspidey</a></p>",

Enjoy, feedback is always appreciated and reblogs help me a lot!</i></p><p><b>\u2192summary: </b>Turns out that Tony Stark wasn\u2019t the asshole people made of him.</p><p><b>\u2192wc:</b> 3566</p><p><b>Y/</b>n followed her father through\u00a0 the building, scanning her eyes in fascination at the expensive equipment it was decorated with. Tony noticed the way her mouth hung slightly agape and he couldn\u2019t help but feel a little proud over his creation.</p><p>Every once in a while, he would stop and explain something. Describe the origin of said item or tell a funny story about another. Eventually they reached the elevators, who were entirely made out of glass, making Y/n desperatly grab onto the railing.</p><p>\u201cFRIDAY, where\u2019s Banner?\u201d Tony asked.</p><p>The woman\u2019s voice echoed in the elevator, starling Y/n once again.</p><p>\u201cMr Banner is in the laboratory\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen that\u2019s where we\u2019re going\u201d </p><p>The elevator started moving at his words and Y/n gave him a concerned look, holding a firm grip around the the metal handles.</p><p>\u201cBanner? As in Dr Bruce Banner?\u201d</p><p>Tony looked at her for a second, surprised at her knowledge.</p><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s the one\u201d</p><p>He saw her pupils widened and a small smile creeping its way onto her lips, and even though she tired to hide it, her entire face showed of the anticipation.</p><p>Tony smirked at the sight as the elevator came to a stop and he quickly got out. He opened his arms and pointed out over the room.</p><p>\u201cThis is where the magic happens\u201d</p><p>Y/n was as in a trans as she tried to take in the outstanding laboratory. It was like nothing she had ever seen before, and she had been to a fair share of labs in her lifetime.</p><p>\u201cThis is amazing\u201d she mumbled as she nearly tripped over herself, making her cheeks crimson as she desperately grabbed onto a table to keep steady. Tony gave her a small smile as he moved further into the room, Y/n tight in his heels.</p><p>In the middle of the room, there was a large hologram projected over a big table. A middle aged man with a white coat and black glasses stood leaned over it, completely focused on what he was doing.</p><p>\u201cBanner?\u201d Tony said, trying to get the man\u2019s attention.</p><p>He repeated his question as he snapped his fingers.</p><p>\u201cBanner?\u201d </p><p>The man shook his head slightly before looking at him.</p><p>\u201cOh, I didn\u2019t hear you\u201d</p><p>Tony raised his eyebrows a little.</p><p>\u201cNoticed that much\u201d</p><p>Bruce\u2019s eyes flickered from Tony to the girl standing next to him, making a wrinkle appear between his brows. </p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s this?\u201d</p><p>Y/n could barely contain her excitement, and she nervously fidgeted with the zipper on her hoodie.</p><p>\u201cThis is Y/n, my daughter\u201d Tony said casually, walking around the hologram and examining it carefully. Bruce\u2019s jaw dropped to the ground, being the third one of the day. </p><p>\u201cW- What? Tony- since when?\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently since 2001, what is this?\u201d He said, his entire attention dedicated to the hologram.</p><p>Bruce shot the girl a sceptical look before turning back to his experiment.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m working on the new airplane design we discussed, the one that was only going to run on renewable energy sources, but it\u2019s difficult to make it completely independent on fossil fuels\u201d</p><p>Tony turned on the design and stroke his chin.</p><p>\u201cWell if-\u201c</p><p>Y/n took a step forward, looking over the blueprint as well.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you just combine different energy sources? Like making it run mostly from biofuels, but adding solar panels and electricity driven motors? You need to start out small though, there isn\u2019t enough technology to make full airplane sized electric motors without making the entire city blackout. Also, you can also try taking advance of the wind, that is another very powerful energy source that you always will have access to, so the faster you fly, the more energy is created. But then you have..\u201d</p><p>She trailed of, getting lost in her head. Bruce stared at her for a second only to turn his eyes to Tony, who looked stupidly proud. </p><p>\u201cHow?-\u201c</p><p>Tony only shook his head, watching as his daughter intensely ran some math through her head, and watching her sigh happily as she figured it out.</p><p>She had been so quiet until now, where she seemed to be able to go on for eternities about what she was passionate about, and it hurt him a little seeing as she probably never had anyone to discuss these kinds of things with before.</p><p>She quickly took a piece of paper out of her black jeans and scribbled something down in a messy handwriting.</p><p>Y/n looked pleased with herself before she noticed the two people staring, and her cheeks grew a rosy color. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I just-\u201c she stuttered but was interrupted by Bruce.</p><p>\u201cNo! Don\u2019t apologize. You actually have a point\u201d </p><p>She smiled big at his sentence before she took a deep breath and a step closer to him.</p><p>\u201cDr Banner\u201d</p><p>Bruce flinched slightly at the mention of \u2018dr\u2019 as most people only called him by his first name nowadays. Or the\u00a0\u2018Hulk\u2019, which was a name he had come to dislike.</p><p>\u201cI am such a huge fan of yours and I really loved your article on anti electron collisions, oh, and the lesson you held at my university. About biochemistry and the biological process of the evolution? It was amazing!\u201d</p><p>Words and praises were falling out if Y/n\u2019s mouth like they were running water and she was a leaking tap.</p><p>Bruce was stunned, to say the least, of the seventeen year olds advanced knowledge, and he could see where she had gotten it from. Tony stood in the other end of the round table, trying to cover up the cocky smirk that clad his lips.</p><p>\u201cThank you Y/n\u201d Bruce replied with a genuine smile. He was used to getting praised but for other reasons, like turning into a green monster and saving the world from aliens, something the small girl in front of him seemed completely oblivious to.</p><p>\u201cHow come you are reading those kinds of articles? I mean, you\u2019re seventeen\u201d</p><p>Y/n shrugged her shoulder a little, feeling the increasing anxiety creep up on her.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know Dr Banner, I guess i\u2019m just naturally interested\u201d </p><p>She flashed him a nervous smile, noticing that he subject made her uncomfortable, he decided not to further pressure her.</p><p>\u201cAlright, but if you want something to do I would be happy to show you a new article I\u2019m writing on\u201d</p><p>Y/n\u2019s face lit up.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>Bruce nodded and y/n smiled so big the sides od her eyes were crinkling up.</p><p>Tony, who watched the entire thing, grew more fond of the girl by the seconds, and even though he had only known her for about three hours, she already had a special place in his heart. And he knew that if anything ever happened to her, blood would be spilt.</p><p>-</p><p>The day passed by in high speed and Y/n and her father found themselves bonding pretty quickly. They shared a lot of interests and both of them had a fascinating obsession with technology. Y/n began opening up a little to him, feeling the most comfortable she had felt since her mother passed. It was small things that crushed him a little inside like the way she was fascinated over the pool, and claiming she had never been to one. She was so innocent, yet she had been through so much. </p><p>After asking for some privacy, the rest of the avengers had left the girl and her father alone, although Tony was sure that he saw them in the corner of his eye at multiple occasions.</p><p>The clock was nearing 7 and he new that he was going to have to pop the question sooner or later.</p><p>\u201dSo\u2026\u201d</p><p>he started, making both of them stop in their tracks.</p><p>\u201dWhere are you staying?\u201d</p><p>Y/n rubbed her palms together as she felt her stomach growl of hunger.</p><p>\u201dUhm, at the Colton Centre Hotel in the city. I just kinda packed everything I had and left\u201d</p><p>Tony nodded understandingly, not wanting to pressure the fragile teenager.</p><p>\u201cWhat would you say about living here? Then you would have access to FRIDAY all the time, the lab, Bruce and.. me\u201d </p><p>Tony looked up to meet her gaze, where a smile was playing on her lips.</p><p>\u201cI would like that, and getting to know you a bit better\u201d</p><p>This time it was Tony\u2019s time to smile and he gave her a gentle pat on the shoulder before picking up his pace again.</p><p>\u201cGreat! I will have Happy pick up your bags, now let\u2019s go get some food into that system of yours\u201d</p><p>The Avengers kitchen was, as expected, huge. Tony explained that they all shared it, even though there were multiple others scattered around the building. </p><p>As they stepped of the elevator Yn could smell the pasta on the stove. Only the smell made her stomach let out loud noises and she blushed a little because of it. Loud voices were echoing between the walls and Tony sent her a worried look, asking for permission to enter the room with the avengers there, which she replied to with a small nod.</p><p>\u201cHey guys\u201d Tony said, walking confidently into the room with Y/n right behind him. The laughter died out and every pair of eyes were directed to the short girl behind him. Confusion were written over their foreheads and Tony eventually pointed to Y/n.</p><p>\u201cThis is my daughter, Y/n\u201d </p><p>Sam was about to open his mouth and leave a snarky comment but Tony sent him a death stare and hissed a low \u201cdon\u2019t\u201d his way, making him hold up his hands in surrender.</p><p>\u201dShe\u2019s seventeen and she\u2019s going to live here with us now, and no, I had no idea I had a daughter until six hours ago\u201d Tony stared intensely at Sam.</p><p>\u201cOkay, great, glad we got that out of the way. What are you cooking?\u201d He continued, walking up to Wanda who were stirring a deep read tomato sauce.</p><p>\u201cUhm, Stark\u201d Natasha said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re ready to leave the subject yet\u201d</p><p>All eyes were still on Y/n were she stood as glued to the ground, once again fidgeting with the zipper of her hoodie. </p><p>\u201cYeah Stark, this is a truck you can\u2019t stop with your suit\u201d Clint added, making Tony furrow his brows at the mans try to be clever.</p><p>Without thinking, Y/n chimed into the discussion.</p><p>\u201cActually, that should not be possible. I saw the video of the the boy dressed in red and blue tights, and a human should not be able to stop a car going 40 miles an hour. Or have telepathic abilities. It defies all laws of physics, chemistry AND biology. It should not be possible\u201d</p><p>Her eyes were quick to land on the floor again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m so sorry\u201d</p><p>She was interrupted by the blonde with the broad shoulders coming into the kitchen, holding a green apple in his hand.</p><p>\u201cYou better watch out, she\u2019s a genius\u201d</p><p>Y/n felt her cheeks getting hot as confused eyes flickered through the room.</p><p>\u201dAre you ever going to introduce us?\u201d Bucky said, getting Tony\u2019s attention.</p><p>He licked the tomato sauce of his finger before standing next to Y/n. He carefully wrapped an arm around her shoulders, looking at her for permission. She nodded slightly, enjoying the small act of affection. </p><p>\u201cMeet the avengers\u201d Tony said sarcastically and let go of the girl, making Bucky roll his eyes at him before sending her a warm smile. He got out of his chair and held out his hand, which she shook lightly with a small smile.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m James, but most people call me Bucky\u201d</p><p>He let go of her and turned around, pointing to the other people crowded around the kitchen island.</p><p>\u201cThis is Sam, he\u2019s an asshole\u201d he said, making the man smirk mischievously. Bucky put no effort into replying, instead he just continued on.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Natasha, and she\u2019s not as scary as she looks\u201d he pointed to a small woman with a cold expression on her face, making her look intimidating.</p><p>\u201cClint is the one on the stool, Wanda is cooking and the tall one over there is Thor\u201d</p><p>Y/n let out a smile.</p><p>\u201cThor? Almost as in the germanic mythology, son of Odin? The god of thunder?\u201d she said jokingly.</p><p>This caught the tall man\u2019s attention and he made his way to her with two long steps.</p><p>\u201cYes Miss Y/n. That is me\u201d</p><p>Y/n looked up to him in confusion. Disbelief written over her face.</p><p>\u201cUhm, Okay\u201d</p><p>Thor didn\u2019t like how sceptical the girl was being, and he about to reach his arm out to call on Mjolnir before Tony stopped him.</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay, we understand. You\u2019re the god of thunder and son of odin, bla bla bla\u201d</p><p>He held his pointer finger out warningly.</p><p>\u201cBut don\u2019t you break that window again, or else I will tell Loki that you are planning on betraying him\u201d</p><p>Thor let out a huff before going back to his place around the table, sending Tony evil looks behind his back.</p><p>\u201cOkay, dinners ready\u201d Wanda said, a slight accent covering her words.</p><p>As the avengers flocked around the food, Y/n remained frozen to the ground, her father next to her.</p><p>\u201cHey, kid\u201d he said, snapping her out her trans.</p><p>Her eyes met his, and she noticed the small worry wrinkle he had in his forehead.</p><p>\u201cYou alright?\u201d</p><p>Y/n nodded slightly, swallowing thickly.</p><p>\u201cJust a lot of people\u201d</p><p>Tony looked at her with kind eyes.</p><p>\u201cGrab some food and I\u2019ll show you to your room, how about that?\u201d</p><p>Y/n nodded and a wave of relief washed over her as she carefully put some pasta on her plate and drenched it in the red tomato sauce.</p><p>Tony gave her a smile as he grabbed his plate as well and went back to the elevator, Y/n following close by.</p><p>\u201cFRIDAY, take us to floor six\u201d</p><p>The elevator started moving and Y/n held a tighter grib on her plate as in a reflex.</p><p>\u201cI live on the seventh , so I\u2019m only a floor away if you need me\u201d The man started, taking a bite of pasta into his mouth. </p><p>As the elevator came to a halt, he quickly swallowed to retrain his speech ability. </p><p>\u201cThere is only two rooms here, yours and our friendly neighborhood spiderman's\u201d</p><p>As he saw the confused look on the girls face he explained further.</p><p>\u201dThe guy in red-and-blue tights catching the car\u201d</p><p>\u201dOh\u201d </p><p>Y/n said, letting the pieces fall into place. And Tony couldn\u2019t help but be a little confused at her knowledge, the one that wasn\u2019t there, about the avengers.</p><p>He unlocked the door and stood to the side, letting Y/n walk in first. The apartment was beautiful. Easily decorated like the rest of the building, but there were gold details added here and there, giving it an expensive and luxurious look.</p><p>\u201cHoly shit Tony!\u201d</p><p>She breathed out, speechless at the realization that this room, the one with the large flat screen tv and bathtub big enough to fit two of her, was in fact hers. It was more than she had ever had in her entire life, heck, the room was bigger than the houses she had lived in growing up.</p><p>Tony smiled at her, his heart growing bigger as he noticed the small things they had in common. Like the way she held her hands out when she was surprised, to the signature eye roll that Tony rocked every day. </p><p>In the eight hours he had spent together with her, knowing that he had a daughter, it was like he had become a different man. In only eight hours she had showed him a new kind of happiness and in only eight hours, he knew that he loved the girl almost running around inside of the apartment. </p><p>Meanwhile, three floors downstairs, most of the avengers were gathered in the big living room. They had all finished their dinner and were now sitting in silence.</p><p>\u201cWhat is up with Stark today?\u201d Clint finally said, breaking the icy silence.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, he is like a completely different person\u201d Sam spoke.</p><p>\u201cYou know that he haven\u2019t insulted me once since she got here\u201d Steve continued.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s almost nice\u201d Natasha said, getting the attention of the many super heroes.</p><p>\u201cWhat is that girl doing to him?\u201d Steve almost whispered, voice laced in concern.</p><p>\u201cOh, cut it out guys. He\u2019s happy. I haven\u2019t seen him like this since he and Pepper still were a thing. Let him be\u201d</p><p>Bucky pointed to Rhodey as the older man spoke.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s got a point. Plus the whiskey bottles haven\u2019t been touched since yesterday\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what do we think of her?\u201d Wanda suddenly said.</p><p>Thor grunted and they all rolled their eyes at him.</p><p>\u201cWe know! We can\u2019t believe how she doubted that you were the god of thunder and that you come from an entirely different planet!\u201d Sam added sarcastically.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s AMAZING\u201d a voice yelled from the kitchen, and into the living room came Bruce. He had a burrito in his hand and a little mayonnaise on his cheek. His glasses were sitting a little crooked on his nose and he looked like he hadn\u2019t gone outside for a week. Which he probably hadn\u2019t either.</p><p>\u201cYou know that equation I haven\u2019t been able to solve for like a week?\u201d he continued as he sat down next to Nat on the grey couch.</p><p>The avengers sighed, not wanting to be remembered of his never ending complaining about that stupid equation.</p><p>Bruce raised a brow at their reaction before going back to talking.</p><p>\u201cShe solved it in like five minutes! Steve was there!\u201d</p><p>The eyes were turned to Steve who nodded honestly.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true, she\u2019s a genius. All it took for her was a look at the board and she had it all figured out, she\u2019s a living calculator\u201d</p><p>The heroes all shared puzzled looks, not knowing what to think about the girl, as Bruce went on about some airplane he was working on. </p><p>But they had one thing clear, if she was able to stop Tony from drinking his brains out a Tuesday morning at nine am, she was worth a chance.</p><p>-</p><p>Y/n and Tony sat around the white table in her room, eating their pasta in a comfortable silence. </p><p>Y/n looked at her father as he was eating, surprised by how calm he had been about this entire thing. She had expected him to throw her out with five grand in her hand and begging her to never come back, instead he had taken her in. He wasn\u2019t at all the arrogant asshole everyone said he was, he was kind and caring and just wanted the best for everyone.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t known him for very long but she could hear her mother\u2019s words ringing in the back of her head. They really had a lot in common. She had his nose and defined cheekbones, and the unusual hairline.</p><p>He noticed her staring and looked up to meet her glassy eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou okay honey?\u201d</p><p>She nodded as she placed her fork on her empty plate, pushing it slightly to the side.</p><p>\u201cThank you\u201d</p><p>Tony looked at her with confusion dripping from his expression.</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d </p><p>\u201cFor this, for everything. For taking me in and showing me all these things and introducing me to all these people\u201d</p><p>The man smiled big, a genuine one that stretched out his lips.</p><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s nothing. I\u2019m just trying to provide for you and make up for all the years I\u2019ve missed of your life\u201d</p><p>Y/n returned his smile and looked down on the white table, suppressing the burning sensation behind her eyelids.</p><p>\u201cNo, but really. I\u2019m so grateful for everything and if you would have shut me out- i don\u2019t know what I would do\u201d</p><p>She swallowed thickly.</p><p>\u201cI don't\u2019 think I would still be here\u201d</p><p>Tony\u2019s smile faded as he heard the words, and even further down sunk his lips as he saw the tear roll down her cheek. She quickly wiped it away, trying to hide the fact that she was, as well as him, broken. He knew the feeling too well and knew how hard- almost hopeless it was.</p><p>He got out of his chair and sat down on the one next to her. It was like something parental kicked in, that caused him to wrap his arms around the girl and pull her tightly to his chest. She froze for a moment, before relaxing and melting into him. He held her shaking frame close, and his heart ached. She was all on her own, and had been since her mother passed. He had no idea how she had made it through, but he knew that she was strong, so strong.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be okay, just breathe alright?\u201d He said softly, feeling her chest rise and sink at his words.</p><p>\u201cSir, there is people at the door\u201d FRIDAY called out in the speakers.</p><p>\u201cNot now FRIDAY\u201d Tony said, still holding the girl in his arms.</p><p>\u201cBut Mr-\u201c</p><p>\u201cNot now\u201d He wheezed. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s an emergency sir\u201d FRIDAY spoke.</p><p>Tony sighed deeply, feeling the rage pumping through his veins. He had barely had time to be sassy, yet angry the entire day, and the feeling felt strange.</p><p>He slowly let go of Y/n, wiping a tear away from her cheek with his thumb before sending her a soft smile through gritted teeth. She let out a few soft sniffles as she wiped her nose with her sleeve, patting her eyes dry.</p><p>Tony looked up into the roof.</p><p>\u201cFRIDAY, what\u2019s the emergency?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe FBI are at the door, sir\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd they are asking for Y/n\u201d</p><p>TAG LIST: <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mkoJfC38neCKI1oYCs1Vqkg\">@writer-grace</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m5WUgXxbDJaUF5MjMIZWSrQ\">@aya-writing</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m-vK_XPk5Oj30f3U0lqEb1Q\">@bookgirlunicorn</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/muONyj81qa-C1DVY9kqiANA\">@peachesandparker</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mO-VItkOnWv68T3F4MTwmLw\">@marvelsswansong</a>\u00a0@spideynora\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mf0C8vr6Kq2xeGjmC_hHD-Q\">@britishspidey</a></p>",

Enjoy, feedback is always appreciated and reblogs help me a lot!</i></p><p><b>&rarr;summary: </b>Turns out that Tony Stark wasn&rsquo;t the asshole people made of him.</p><p><b>&rarr;wc:</b> 3566</p><p><b>Y/</b>n followed her father through&nbsp; the building, scanning her eyes in fascination at the expensive equipment it was decorated with. Tony noticed the way her mouth hung slightly agape and he couldn&rsquo;t help but feel a little proud over his creation.</p><p>Every once in a while, he would stop and explain something. Describe the origin of said item or tell a funny story about another. Eventually they reached the elevators, who were entirely made out of glass, making Y/n desperatly grab onto the railing.</p><p>&ldquo;FRIDAY, where&rsquo;s Banner?&rdquo; Tony asked.</p><p>The woman&rsquo;s voice echoed in the elevator, starling Y/n once again.</p><p>&ldquo;Mr Banner is in the laboratory&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then that&rsquo;s where we&rsquo;re going&rdquo; </p><p>The elevator started moving at his words and Y/n gave him a concerned look, holding a firm grip around the the metal handles.</p><p>&ldquo;Banner? As in Dr Bruce Banner?&rdquo;</p><p>Tony looked at her for a second, surprised at her knowledge.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s the one&rdquo;</p><p>He saw her pupils widened and a small smile creeping its way onto her lips, and even though she tired to hide it, her entire face showed of the anticipation.</p><p>Tony smirked at the sight as the elevator came to a stop and he quickly got out. He opened his arms and pointed out over the room.</p><p>&ldquo;This is where the magic happens&rdquo;</p><p>Y/n was as in a trans as she tried to take in the outstanding laboratory. It was like nothing she had ever seen before, and she had been to a fair share of labs in her lifetime.</p><p>&ldquo;This is amazing&rdquo; she mumbled as she nearly tripped over herself, making her cheeks crimson as she desperately grabbed onto a table to keep steady. Tony gave her a small smile as he moved further into the room, Y/n tight in his heels.</p><p>In the middle of the room, there was a large hologram projected over a big table. A middle aged man with a white coat and black glasses stood leaned over it, completely focused on what he was doing.</p><p>&ldquo;Banner?&rdquo; Tony said, trying to get the man&rsquo;s attention.</p><p>He repeated his question as he snapped his fingers.</p><p>&ldquo;Banner?&rdquo; </p><p>The man shook his head slightly before looking at him.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, I didn&rsquo;t hear you&rdquo;</p><p>Tony raised his eyebrows a little.</p><p>&ldquo;Noticed that much&rdquo;</p><p>Bruce&rsquo;s eyes flickered from Tony to the girl standing next to him, making a wrinkle appear between his brows. </p><p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s this?&rdquo;</p><p>Y/n could barely contain her excitement, and she nervously fidgeted with the zipper on her hoodie.</p><p>&ldquo;This is Y/n, my daughter&rdquo; Tony said casually, walking around the hologram and examining it carefully. Bruce&rsquo;s jaw dropped to the ground, being the third one of the day. </p><p>&ldquo;W- What? Tony- since when?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Apparently since 2001, what is this?&rdquo; He said, his entire attention dedicated to the hologram.</p><p>Bruce shot the girl a sceptical look before turning back to his experiment.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m working on the new airplane design we discussed, the one that was only going to run on renewable energy sources, but it&rsquo;s difficult to make it completely independent on fossil fuels&rdquo;</p><p>Tony turned on the design and stroke his chin.</p><p>&ldquo;Well if-&ldquo;</p><p>Y/n took a step forward, looking over the blueprint as well.</p><p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you just combine different energy sources? Like making it run mostly from biofuels, but adding solar panels and electricity driven motors? You need to start out small though, there isn&rsquo;t enough technology to make full airplane sized electric motors without making the entire city blackout. Also, you can also try taking advance of the wind, that is another very powerful energy source that you always will have access to, so the faster you fly, the more energy is created. But then you have..&rdquo;</p><p>She trailed of, getting lost in her head. Bruce stared at her for a second only to turn his eyes to Tony, who looked stupidly proud. </p><p>&ldquo;How?-&ldquo;</p><p>Tony only shook his head, watching as his daughter intensely ran some math through her head, and watching her sigh happily as she figured it out.</p><p>She had been so quiet until now, where she seemed to be able to go on for eternities about what she was passionate about, and it hurt him a little seeing as she probably never had anyone to discuss these kinds of things with before.</p><p>She quickly took a piece of paper out of her black jeans and scribbled something down in a messy handwriting.</p><p>Y/n looked pleased with herself before she noticed the two people staring, and her cheeks grew a rosy color. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry I just-&ldquo; she stuttered but was interrupted by Bruce.</p><p>&ldquo;No! Don&rsquo;t apologize. You actually have a point&rdquo; </p><p>She smiled big at his sentence before she took a deep breath and a step closer to him.</p><p>&ldquo;Dr Banner&rdquo;</p><p>Bruce flinched slightly at the mention of &lsquo;dr&rsquo; as most people only called him by his first name nowadays. Or the&nbsp;&lsquo;Hulk&rsquo;, which was a name he had come to dislike.</p><p>&ldquo;I am such a huge fan of yours and I really loved your article on anti electron collisions, oh, and the lesson you held at my university. About biochemistry and the biological process of the evolution? It was amazing!&rdquo;</p><p>Words and praises were falling out if Y/n&rsquo;s mouth like they were running water and she was a leaking tap.</p><p>Bruce was stunned, to say the least, of the seventeen year olds advanced knowledge, and he could see where she had gotten it from. Tony stood in the other end of the round table, trying to cover up the cocky smirk that clad his lips.</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you Y/n&rdquo; Bruce replied with a genuine smile. He was used to getting praised but for other reasons, like turning into a green monster and saving the world from aliens, something the small girl in front of him seemed completely oblivious to.</p><p>&ldquo;How come you are reading those kinds of articles? I mean, you&rsquo;re seventeen&rdquo;</p><p>Y/n shrugged her shoulder a little, feeling the increasing anxiety creep up on her.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know Dr Banner, I guess i&rsquo;m just naturally interested&rdquo; </p><p>She flashed him a nervous smile, noticing that he subject made her uncomfortable, he decided not to further pressure her.</p><p>&ldquo;Alright, but if you want something to do I would be happy to show you a new article I&rsquo;m writing on&rdquo;</p><p>Y/n&rsquo;s face lit up.</p><p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo;</p><p>Bruce nodded and y/n smiled so big the sides od her eyes were crinkling up.</p><p>Tony, who watched the entire thing, grew more fond of the girl by the seconds, and even though he had only known her for about three hours, she already had a special place in his heart. And he knew that if anything ever happened to her, blood would be spilt.</p><p>-</p><p>The day passed by in high speed and Y/n and her father found themselves bonding pretty quickly. They shared a lot of interests and both of them had a fascinating obsession with technology. Y/n began opening up a little to him, feeling the most comfortable she had felt since her mother passed. It was small things that crushed him a little inside like the way she was fascinated over the pool, and claiming she had never been to one. She was so innocent, yet she had been through so much. </p><p>After asking for some privacy, the rest of the avengers had left the girl and her father alone, although Tony was sure that he saw them in the corner of his eye at multiple occasions.</p><p>The clock was nearing 7 and he new that he was going to have to pop the question sooner or later.</p><p>&rdquo;So&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>he started, making both of them stop in their tracks.</p><p>&rdquo;Where are you staying?&rdquo;</p><p>Y/n rubbed her palms together as she felt her stomach growl of hunger.</p><p>&rdquo;Uhm, at the Colton Centre Hotel in the city. I just kinda packed everything I had and left&rdquo;</p><p>Tony nodded understandingly, not wanting to pressure the fragile teenager.</p><p>&ldquo;What would you say about living here? Then you would have access to FRIDAY all the time, the lab, Bruce and.. me&rdquo; </p><p>Tony looked up to meet her gaze, where a smile was playing on her lips.</p><p>&ldquo;I would like that, and getting to know you a bit better&rdquo;</p><p>This time it was Tony&rsquo;s time to smile and he gave her a gentle pat on the shoulder before picking up his pace again.</p><p>&ldquo;Great! I will have Happy pick up your bags, now let&rsquo;s go get some food into that system of yours&rdquo;</p><p>The Avengers kitchen was, as expected, huge. Tony explained that they all shared it, even though there were multiple others scattered around the building. </p><p>As they stepped of the elevator Yn could smell the pasta on the stove. Only the smell made her stomach let out loud noises and she blushed a little because of it. Loud voices were echoing between the walls and Tony sent her a worried look, asking for permission to enter the room with the avengers there, which she replied to with a small nod.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey guys&rdquo; Tony said, walking confidently into the room with Y/n right behind him. The laughter died out and every pair of eyes were directed to the short girl behind him. Confusion were written over their foreheads and Tony eventually pointed to Y/n.</p><p>&ldquo;This is my daughter, Y/n&rdquo; </p><p>Sam was about to open his mouth and leave a snarky comment but Tony sent him a death stare and hissed a low &ldquo;don&rsquo;t&rdquo; his way, making him hold up his hands in surrender.</p><p>&rdquo;She&rsquo;s seventeen and she&rsquo;s going to live here with us now, and no, I had no idea I had a daughter until six hours ago&rdquo; Tony stared intensely at Sam.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, great, glad we got that out of the way. What are you cooking?&rdquo; He continued, walking up to Wanda who were stirring a deep read tomato sauce.</p><p>&ldquo;Uhm, Stark&rdquo; Natasha said.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;re ready to leave the subject yet&rdquo;</p><p>All eyes were still on Y/n were she stood as glued to the ground, once again fidgeting with the zipper of her hoodie. </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah Stark, this is a truck you can&rsquo;t stop with your suit&rdquo; Clint added, making Tony furrow his brows at the mans try to be clever.</p><p>Without thinking, Y/n chimed into the discussion.</p><p>&ldquo;Actually, that should not be possible. I saw the video of the the boy dressed in red and blue tights, and a human should not be able to stop a car going 40 miles an hour. Or have telepathic abilities. It defies all laws of physics, chemistry AND biology. It should not be possible&rdquo;</p><p>Her eyes were quick to land on the floor again.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, I&rsquo;m so sorry&rdquo;</p><p>She was interrupted by the blonde with the broad shoulders coming into the kitchen, holding a green apple in his hand.</p><p>&ldquo;You better watch out, she&rsquo;s a genius&rdquo;</p><p>Y/n felt her cheeks getting hot as confused eyes flickered through the room.</p><p>&rdquo;Are you ever going to introduce us?&rdquo; Bucky said, getting Tony&rsquo;s attention.</p><p>He licked the tomato sauce of his finger before standing next to Y/n. He carefully wrapped an arm around her shoulders, looking at her for permission. She nodded slightly, enjoying the small act of affection. </p><p>&ldquo;Meet the avengers&rdquo; Tony said sarcastically and let go of the girl, making Bucky roll his eyes at him before sending her a warm smile. He got out of his chair and held out his hand, which she shook lightly with a small smile.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m James, but most people call me Bucky&rdquo;</p><p>He let go of her and turned around, pointing to the other people crowded around the kitchen island.</p><p>&ldquo;This is Sam, he&rsquo;s an asshole&rdquo; he said, making the man smirk mischievously. Bucky put no effort into replying, instead he just continued on.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Natasha, and she&rsquo;s not as scary as she looks&rdquo; he pointed to a small woman with a cold expression on her face, making her look intimidating.</p><p>&ldquo;Clint is the one on the stool, Wanda is cooking and the tall one over there is Thor&rdquo;</p><p>Y/n let out a smile.</p><p>&ldquo;Thor? Almost as in the germanic mythology, son of Odin? The god of thunder?&rdquo; she said jokingly.</p><p>This caught the tall man&rsquo;s attention and he made his way to her with two long steps.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes Miss Y/n. That is me&rdquo;</p><p>Y/n looked up to him in confusion. Disbelief written over her face.</p><p>&ldquo;Uhm, Okay&rdquo;</p><p>Thor didn&rsquo;t like how sceptical the girl was being, and he about to reach his arm out to call on Mjolnir before Tony stopped him.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, okay, we understand. You&rsquo;re the god of thunder and son of odin, bla bla bla&rdquo;</p><p>He held his pointer finger out warningly.</p><p>&ldquo;But don&rsquo;t you break that window again, or else I will tell Loki that you are planning on betraying him&rdquo;</p><p>Thor let out a huff before going back to his place around the table, sending Tony evil looks behind his back.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, dinners ready&rdquo; Wanda said, a slight accent covering her words.</p><p>As the avengers flocked around the food, Y/n remained frozen to the ground, her father next to her.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, kid&rdquo; he said, snapping her out her trans.</p><p>Her eyes met his, and she noticed the small worry wrinkle he had in his forehead.</p><p>&ldquo;You alright?&rdquo;</p><p>Y/n nodded slightly, swallowing thickly.</p><p>&ldquo;Just a lot of people&rdquo;</p><p>Tony looked at her with kind eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;Grab some food and I&rsquo;ll show you to your room, how about that?&rdquo;</p><p>Y/n nodded and a wave of relief washed over her as she carefully put some pasta on her plate and drenched it in the red tomato sauce.</p><p>Tony gave her a smile as he grabbed his plate as well and went back to the elevator, Y/n following close by.</p><p>&ldquo;FRIDAY, take us to floor six&rdquo;</p><p>The elevator started moving and Y/n held a tighter grib on her plate as in a reflex.</p><p>&ldquo;I live on the seventh , so I&rsquo;m only a floor away if you need me&rdquo; The man started, taking a bite of pasta into his mouth. </p><p>As the elevator came to a halt, he quickly swallowed to retrain his speech ability. </p><p>&ldquo;There is only two rooms here, yours and our friendly neighborhood spiderman's&rdquo;</p><p>As he saw the confused look on the girls face he explained further.</p><p>&rdquo;The guy in red-and-blue tights catching the car&rdquo;</p><p>&rdquo;Oh&rdquo; </p><p>Y/n said, letting the pieces fall into place. And Tony couldn&rsquo;t help but be a little confused at her knowledge, the one that wasn&rsquo;t there, about the avengers.</p><p>He unlocked the door and stood to the side, letting Y/n walk in first. The apartment was beautiful. Easily decorated like the rest of the building, but there were gold details added here and there, giving it an expensive and luxurious look.</p><p>&ldquo;Holy shit Tony!&rdquo;</p><p>She breathed out, speechless at the realization that this room, the one with the large flat screen tv and bathtub big enough to fit two of her, was in fact hers. It was more than she had ever had in her entire life, heck, the room was bigger than the houses she had lived in growing up.</p><p>Tony smiled at her, his heart growing bigger as he noticed the small things they had in common. Like the way she held her hands out when she was surprised, to the signature eye roll that Tony rocked every day. </p><p>In the eight hours he had spent together with her, knowing that he had a daughter, it was like he had become a different man. In only eight hours she had showed him a new kind of happiness and in only eight hours, he knew that he loved the girl almost running around inside of the apartment. </p><p>Meanwhile, three floors downstairs, most of the avengers were gathered in the big living room. They had all finished their dinner and were now sitting in silence.</p><p>&ldquo;What is up with Stark today?&rdquo; Clint finally said, breaking the icy silence.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, he is like a completely different person&rdquo; Sam spoke.</p><p>&ldquo;You know that he haven&rsquo;t insulted me once since she got here&rdquo; Steve continued.</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s almost nice&rdquo; Natasha said, getting the attention of the many super heroes.</p><p>&ldquo;What is that girl doing to him?&rdquo; Steve almost whispered, voice laced in concern.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, cut it out guys. He&rsquo;s happy. I haven&rsquo;t seen him like this since he and Pepper still were a thing. Let him be&rdquo;</p><p>Bucky pointed to Rhodey as the older man spoke.</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s got a point. Plus the whiskey bottles haven&rsquo;t been touched since yesterday&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But what do we think of her?&rdquo; Wanda suddenly said.</p><p>Thor grunted and they all rolled their eyes at him.</p><p>&ldquo;We know! We can&rsquo;t believe how she doubted that you were the god of thunder and that you come from an entirely different planet!&rdquo; Sam added sarcastically.</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s AMAZING&rdquo; a voice yelled from the kitchen, and into the living room came Bruce. He had a burrito in his hand and a little mayonnaise on his cheek. His glasses were sitting a little crooked on his nose and he looked like he hadn&rsquo;t gone outside for a week. Which he probably hadn&rsquo;t either.</p><p>&ldquo;You know that equation I haven&rsquo;t been able to solve for like a week?&rdquo; he continued as he sat down next to Nat on the grey couch.</p><p>The avengers sighed, not wanting to be remembered of his never ending complaining about that stupid equation.</p><p>Bruce raised a brow at their reaction before going back to talking.</p><p>&ldquo;She solved it in like five minutes! Steve was there!&rdquo;</p><p>The eyes were turned to Steve who nodded honestly.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s true, she&rsquo;s a genius. All it took for her was a look at the board and she had it all figured out, she&rsquo;s a living calculator&rdquo;</p><p>The heroes all shared puzzled looks, not knowing what to think about the girl, as Bruce went on about some airplane he was working on. </p><p>But they had one thing clear, if she was able to stop Tony from drinking his brains out a Tuesday morning at nine am, she was worth a chance.</p><p>-</p><p>Y/n and Tony sat around the white table in her room, eating their pasta in a comfortable silence. </p><p>Y/n looked at her father as he was eating, surprised by how calm he had been about this entire thing. She had expected him to throw her out with five grand in her hand and begging her to never come back, instead he had taken her in. He wasn&rsquo;t at all the arrogant asshole everyone said he was, he was kind and caring and just wanted the best for everyone.</p><p>She hadn&rsquo;t known him for very long but she could hear her mother&rsquo;s words ringing in the back of her head. They really had a lot in common. She had his nose and defined cheekbones, and the unusual hairline.</p><p>He noticed her staring and looked up to meet her glassy eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;You okay honey?&rdquo;</p><p>She nodded as she placed her fork on her empty plate, pushing it slightly to the side.</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you&rdquo;</p><p>Tony looked at her with confusion dripping from his expression.</p><p>&ldquo;For what?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;For this, for everything. For taking me in and showing me all these things and introducing me to all these people&rdquo;</p><p>The man smiled big, a genuine one that stretched out his lips.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s nothing. I&rsquo;m just trying to provide for you and make up for all the years I&rsquo;ve missed of your life&rdquo;</p><p>Y/n returned his smile and looked down on the white table, suppressing the burning sensation behind her eyelids.</p><p>&ldquo;No, but really. I&rsquo;m so grateful for everything and if you would have shut me out- i don&rsquo;t know what I would do&rdquo;</p><p>She swallowed thickly.</p><p>&ldquo;I don't&rsquo; think I would still be here&rdquo;</p><p>Tony&rsquo;s smile faded as he heard the words, and even further down sunk his lips as he saw the tear roll down her cheek. She quickly wiped it away, trying to hide the fact that she was, as well as him, broken. He knew the feeling too well and knew how hard- almost hopeless it was.</p><p>He got out of his chair and sat down on the one next to her. It was like something parental kicked in, that caused him to wrap his arms around the girl and pull her tightly to his chest. She froze for a moment, before relaxing and melting into him. He held her shaking frame close, and his heart ached. She was all on her own, and had been since her mother passed. He had no idea how she had made it through, but he knew that she was strong, so strong.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be okay, just breathe alright?&rdquo; He said softly, feeling her chest rise and sink at his words.</p><p>&ldquo;Sir, there is people at the door&rdquo; FRIDAY called out in the speakers.</p><p>&ldquo;Not now FRIDAY&rdquo; Tony said, still holding the girl in his arms.</p><p>&ldquo;But Mr-&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not now&rdquo; He wheezed. </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an emergency sir&rdquo; FRIDAY spoke.</p><p>Tony sighed deeply, feeling the rage pumping through his veins. He had barely had time to be sassy, yet angry the entire day, and the feeling felt strange.</p><p>He slowly let go of Y/n, wiping a tear away from her cheek with his thumb before sending her a soft smile through gritted teeth. She let out a few soft sniffles as she wiped her nose with her sleeve, patting her eyes dry.</p><p>Tony looked up into the roof.</p><p>&ldquo;FRIDAY, what&rsquo;s the emergency?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The FBI are at the door, sir&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And they are asking for Y/n&rdquo;</p><p>TAG LIST: <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mkoJfC38neCKI1oYCs1Vqkg\">@writer-grace</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m5WUgXxbDJaUF5MjMIZWSrQ\">@aya-writing</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m-vK_XPk5Oj30f3U0lqEb1Q\">@bookgirlunicorn</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/muONyj81qa-C1DVY9kqiANA\">@peachesandparker</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mO-VItkOnWv68T3F4MTwmLw\">@marvelsswansong</a>&nbsp;@spideynora&nbsp;<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mf0C8vr6Kq2xeGjmC_hHD-Q\">@britishspidey</a></p>",
