Just for refrence, I'm 27 so I'd prefer only people who are 18+ to interact with my blog, since my fics and some other stuff I post could be explicit/inappropriate/NSFW.",

She didn\u2019t look at him, not even once, since when they met yesterday, her blue eyes trained ahead of her. The wedding in the custom of the Old Gods was her only request. Still, his father wasn\u2019t pleased, talking behind the closed doors about the blasphemy of it all. But Jon felt only calm surrounded by the trees and overwhelming cold of the North. It was so different from the stuffed air in the Kings Landing, refreshing even. He felt like he could fit amongst these men, better than in the stiff frames of his role as the Prince of the Realm, as he wasn\u2019t anything his father was hoping for. No match for the King, almost a bastard, not fit to ride the dragon and charm foreign guests. \u00a0</p><p>As he could see now, noticing how Sansa stiffened every time he had to touch her, even a smallest brush of his fingers against hers leaving her frozen. Somehow, it seemed to be fitting the surroundings, as he felt her older brother\u2019s glare on the back of his head. As if he had more choice in this than them. </p><p>He also was a prisoner here, after all. </p><p>*** </p><p>They hadn\u2019t stayed in Winterfell very long. His father had bigger plans and gave them little abandoned castle in The Gift, barely fitting for the Prince and Warden of the North. </p><p>It was perfect. </p><p>His wife didn\u2019t seem to think so but kept her thoughts to herself. He didn\u2019t know how to talk to her, when her only answers seemed to be \u2018No, my Lord\u2019 or \u2018It\u2019s no problem, my Lord\u2019. He had no illusions about their marriage, but he grew more and more irritated with each passing day. He just wanted a companion, somebody to hold onto in this foreign land, odd, but at the same time strangely fitting for him. </p><p>He glanced at his lady wife sitting at the other end of the table. Just as he seemed at home North, he thought the South would suit her, with its delicate words, gallant knights and beautiful songs played by his brother every knight. Right now, the only thing that broke silence was his knife grating the plate. </p><p>He knew she hold back the scowl, the perfect Lady she was. </p><p>*** </p><p>Jon saw her glancing at him. Sansa maybe thought he didn\u2019t notice, but after a few months spent together in this silent limbo, he was attuned to her every move and expression that she let slip past her walls. And so, he waited for her to do that again, trying to cover her interest with fumbling for thread or looking at the pattern. He sighed and moved the letters in her direction. She stopped her moves, stunned. Jon smiled, as he didn\u2019t think he would ever see his lady wife this out of control. </p><p>\u201cYou probably are better than me, my Lady\u201d he managed to say, wincing at how awkward way he sounded. Sansa studied him silently, carefully, looking like she was ready to bolt at any moment. Jon stayed as still as he could, trying not to fidget under her scrutiny. Finally, she apparently saw something that calmed her down and gingerly reached for the papers. \u00a0</p><p>Jon observed her as she closely examined the words, caught up in the way she looked illuminated by candles. It was rare event, when he could just take her in, as she usually avoided his attentions. </p><p>By Gods, she was beautiful, the kind of woman his brother would write songs about, unattainable and out of reach for him most of the times. But right now, as she started quietly advising him, pointing the things he would never see for himself, she was closer to him than she ever was before. </p><p>*** </p><p>Sansa endured the difficulties of the travel better than he thought. His lady wife carried unexpected strength inside her, one that he rarely had privilege to see. She also preferred to join him on the horseback and the company wasn\u2019t unwelcome. With her soft voice carrying the stories about the North, the days went past in a blink of an eye and with her example, their men started warming up to him; not only showing respect that he managed to gain but also some sort of rough sympathy. </p><p>Jon snickered; only Northmen would be capable to do such a thing and make it seem to be the highest compliment. </p><p>Nearing the Winterfell, Sansa became quieter, franticly looking around and radiating silent excitement. Though she would never break unspoken rules, she looked as if she was ready to run ahead of the company. Jon smiled fondly, he highly enjoyed the moments Sansa let her guard down a little and let him see real her, the strong woman that made his heart skip a bit. </p><p>Sudden rustling tore him from his thoughts. He raised his hand stopping Sansa and quietly summoned their guards. They followed him obediently into the forest near the road. Surprisingly, amongst the trees they didn\u2019t find group of rebels or maybe assassins trying to find the cover in the forest, but a dying she-wolf with four little ones. Jon immediately dismounted the horse, mesmerised by the sight. He cautiously stepped forward, minding the grown direwolf; he had never seen a creature so huge and yet he couldn\u2019t help himself. </p><p>The little ones were barely walking. His attention was drawn to the smallest one, white with red eyes and it seemed he wasn\u2019t the only one, as the pup tried to make his move towards him, stumbling in the process. Jon laughed quietly and slowly reached his hand towards the pup. \u00a0</p><p>A hand suddenly touched his shoulder startling him. He turned his head back, trying to stay as still as he could. His eyes met blue ones sparkling with mirth. Sansa crouched beside him and smiled at him. Warmth radiated from her touch and for a moment everything stopped and the world limited itself to her presence. The only stray thought that appeared in his mind was: I\u2019m home. </p>",

                "content": "<p>My entry for the second day of <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mRpbdheKvN5YAxVc-6OeqEA\">@jonsadreamofspring</a></p><p><b>Day 2</b>&nbsp;<i>wolves / <strike>traitors</strike> / <strike>bastards</strike></i></p><p>They called her the Red Wolf but when she was standing under the Weirwood tree, she reminded him of a frozen statue. She didn&rsquo;t look at him, not even once, since when they met yesterday, her blue eyes trained ahead of her. The wedding in the custom of the Old Gods was her only request. Still, his father wasn&rsquo;t pleased, talking behind the closed doors about the blasphemy of it all. But Jon felt only calm surrounded by the trees and overwhelming cold of the North. It was so different from the stuffed air in the Kings Landing, refreshing even. He felt like he could fit amongst these men, better than in the stiff frames of his role as the Prince of the Realm, as he wasn&rsquo;t anything his father was hoping for. No match for the King, almost a bastard, not fit to ride the dragon and charm foreign guests. &nbsp;</p><p>As he could see now, noticing how Sansa stiffened every time he had to touch her, even a smallest brush of his fingers against hers leaving her frozen. Somehow, it seemed to be fitting the surroundings, as he felt her older brother&rsquo;s glare on the back of his head. As if he had more choice in this than them. </p><p>He also was a prisoner here, after all. </p><p>*** </p><p>They hadn&rsquo;t stayed in Winterfell very long. His father had bigger plans and gave them little abandoned castle in The Gift, barely fitting for the Prince and Warden of the North. </p><p>It was perfect. </p><p>His wife didn&rsquo;t seem to think so but kept her thoughts to herself. He didn&rsquo;t know how to talk to her, when her only answers seemed to be &lsquo;No, my Lord&rsquo; or &lsquo;It&rsquo;s no problem, my Lord&rsquo;. He had no illusions about their marriage, but he grew more and more irritated with each passing day. He just wanted a companion, somebody to hold onto in this foreign land, odd, but at the same time strangely fitting for him. </p><p>He glanced at his lady wife sitting at the other end of the table. Just as he seemed at home North, he thought the South would suit her, with its delicate words, gallant knights and beautiful songs played by his brother every knight. Right now, the only thing that broke silence was his knife grating the plate. </p><p>He knew she hold back the scowl, the perfect Lady she was. </p><p>*** </p><p>Jon saw her glancing at him. Sansa maybe thought he didn&rsquo;t notice, but after a few months spent together in this silent limbo, he was attuned to her every move and expression that she let slip past her walls. And so, he waited for her to do that again, trying to cover her interest with fumbling for thread or looking at the pattern. He sighed and moved the letters in her direction. She stopped her moves, stunned. Jon smiled, as he didn&rsquo;t think he would ever see his lady wife this out of control. </p><p>&ldquo;You probably are better than me, my Lady&rdquo; he managed to say, wincing at how awkward way he sounded.

A white wolf with red glowing eyes shows up&hellip;</small></p><p><i><small>fairy tale AU // werewolf AU // little red riding hood elements</small></i></p></blockquote><p>Her lungs were struggling to breath in enough air to keep her going. Every few steps she almost tripped over her own feet. All her muscles were aching and she felt sharp stitches in her side, but she kept on running. The faster she ran, the further she would get before Ramsay would discover that she was gone. And the further away she was when he would discover that his wife was missing, the bigger the chance that she was gonna survive this.</p><p>She had no idea where she was going exactly. This was not the execution of some masterplan that had been thought out carefully and had taken months to prepare. She was simply grabbing a once in a lifetime chance.</p><p>\u201cI have an important meeting to attend, my lady. I will be gone for a few hours, but I assume you will have no trouble entertaining yourself for a little while, will you?\u201d He had really thought he had broken her spirit, her will to flee, her hatred for him. He had really thought he could leave her alone, without guards watching her every step, without his dogs sitting in front of her door with orders to harm her when needed. </p><p>And she had gathered a small basket, some food and water and some clothes and had started running. Because no matter how this story would end, there was no way it could get any worse than her life with Ramsay had been.</p><p>A shiver rolled down her spine when she heard the barking of dogs coming from the woods behind her. She had no idea how much time had passed since she had left, but she didn\u2019t doubt whose dogs were chasing her. Quickly she used her scarf to tie her basket on her back and then she climbed in the nearest tree.</p><p>She had barely reached a branch out of reach when she saw the dogs rushing towards her hiding place. Saliva dripped from their beaks and their sharp teeth glimmered in the evening sun. They pressed their paws against the trunk and barked louder and louder. </p><!-- more --><p>Sansa closed her eyes and she tried to hide herself in between the leaves. But the dogs weren\u2019t stupid. They knew she was here. They recognised her smell. They probably also sensed her fear and the food tied to her back. It was only a matter of time before Ramsay Bolton would be here too. She didn\u2019t dare to think about what he would do.</p><p>Would he simply drag her back to his castle? Would he act like nothing had happened? Would he play the caring and loving husband in front of everyone else, while coming up with new ways to assault her once there was no-one there anymore to see that he was actually a sadistic monster? Or would he order his dogs to eat her alive, to rip the flesh from her bones and to leave her remains to rot away?</p><p>\u201cDear Gods, both the old and the new, if you exist and even care the least bit about me, please\u2026\u201d Sansa whispered. \u201cPlease, find a way to save me from whatever faith Ramsay Bolton has in mind for me.\u201d</p><p>A loud and deafening howl of a wolf echoed through the forest and quickly Sansa opened her eyes again. A few trees away from the one she was hiding in appeared a large shadow. The white wolf was at least three times as big as the dogs and his fiery red eyes stared at the little puppies while he kept on howling.</p><p>One by one the dogs went silent and motionless. Some of them whined barely hearable while they laid flat on the muddy ground, others ran away before the white wolf could come any nearer. The ones who had decided to run were the lucky ones. The sharp white teeth of the wolf snapped the thin necks of the remaining dogs as if they were nothing but little twigs. </p><p>Within less than a few seconds there was nothing but absolute silence and yet Sansa didn\u2019t dare to move. What if the wolf had only saved her because he wanted her for himself? What if he had simply chased away the dogs because he himself was hungry? What if the danger was far from gone now? What if it had only gotten worse? Much worse?</p><p>Once more Sansa closed her eyes and once more she prayed. \u201cDear Gods, both the old and the new. Please, help me get out of this\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy lady?\u201d Sansa\u2019s eyes flashed open again and right under the tree in which she was hiding now stood a handsome young man with dark black curls tied into a bun on the back of his head. He was wearing nothing but a pair of ripped pants and his naked skin was covered in sweat and gleaming. His dark eyes were looking up at her and slowly he stretched out his hand. \u201cDo you want a hand to come down?\u201d</p><p>Sansa stopped breathing. She had her eyes wide open and yet she couldn\u2019t make sense of what had happened. \u201cWhere&rsquo;s the white wolf?\u201d She whispered. Her throat was dry and her entire body started trembling. \u201cDid you kill it? Did it run away?\u201d She swallowed. \u201cI swear, there was a white wolf here. He chased the dogs away and\u2026\u201d </p><p>A small smile appeared on the stranger\u2019s face. He had a deep frown on his forehead and yet there was something about him that made her feel safe and at ease. \u201cThe big bad wolf is gone for now.\u201d He stretched out his hand even further, but she was still out of reach. \u201cI promise he won\u2019t hurt you. I won\u2019t let him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d Sansa still didn\u2019t move. Instead she wrapped her arms around her trembling body to make sure she wouldn\u2019t lose her balance and fall down. \u201cHow do I know I can trust you?\u201d</p><p>The stranger dropped his arm and the smile on his face faltered. \u201cI can\u2019t blame you for not trusting me, lady Sansa.\u201d He paused and it took her a few moments to realise he had used her name. \u201cI&rsquo;ve been trying to find a way to get you out of his claws ever since I saw you at the ball, three months ago.\u201d </p><p>Sansa blinked a few times. She could barely remember the ball, let alone the people who had attended. But she had never gotten the impression before that anyone knew that she longed to be saved and rescued. \u201cHow did you know I\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour smile might have fooled most people, but not me.\u201d The stranger let out a deep sigh. \u201cYou looked pretty, but it was as if I was looking at a puppet.\u201d He clenched his jaws. \u201cAnd I knew right away who was pulling the strings.\u201d He locked his glance with hers. \u201cI\u2019m glad you got away from him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlmost.\u201d Sansa shook her head. \u201cI almost got away from him. If that wolf hadn\u2019t appeared\u2026\u201d She shivered once more. \u201cIt seems that in the end he was the one to find a way to save me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou saved yourself, princess.\u201d The stranger smiled at her again. \u201cBecause you had courage and faith. You ran away, very well knowing what the risks were. You shouldn\u2019t give me all the credits. You should give most of them to yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d Sansa licked her dry lips and then slowly her mind started to make sense of what had happened. And even though she should be terrified. And even though she should only distrust him more, she couldn\u2019t help but smiling back at him. \u201cI still want to thank you.\u201d She climbed down again until she was within reach of his strong arms to help her to the ground.</p><p>\u201cJon, Jon Snow.\u201d He bowed and bent his head. \u201cAnd the pleasure is all mine, princess.\u201d He looked up again and now she saw the hint of red in his eyes, hidden behind their natural darkness. \u201cWhere will you go now?\u201d</p><p>Sansa shook her head. \u201cWhere we will go now?\u201d She reached for his hand and pulled him closer towards her. \u201cI might have found the courage and faith to run away, but I could use someone like you looking out for me anyway. You never know if and when the dogs might come back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be my honour, princess.\u201d Jon bowed once more. \u201cWhere will we go?\u201d</p><p>&ldquo;Anywhere. Everywhere. Somewhere safe.\u201d </p>",

They knew she was here. They recognised her smell. They probably also sensed her fear and the food tied to her back. It was only a matter of time before Ramsay Bolton would be here too. She didn\u2019t dare to think about what he would do.</p><p>Would he simply drag her back to his castle? Would he act like nothing had happened? Would he play the caring and loving husband in front of everyone else, while coming up with new ways to assault her once there was no-one there anymore to see that he was actually a sadistic monster? Or would he order his dogs to eat her alive, to rip the flesh from her bones and to leave her remains to rot away?</p><p>\u201cDear Gods, both the old and the new, if you exist and even care the least bit about me, please\u2026\u201d Sansa whispered. \u201cPlease, find a way to save me from whatever faith Ramsay Bolton has in mind for me.\u201d</p><p>A loud and deafening howl of a wolf echoed through the forest and quickly Sansa opened her eyes again. A few trees away from the one she was hiding in appeared a large shadow. The white wolf was at least three times as big as the dogs and his fiery red eyes stared at the little puppies while he kept on howling.</p><p>One by one the dogs went silent and motionless. Some of them whined barely hearable while they laid flat on the muddy ground, others ran away before the white wolf could come any nearer. The ones who had decided to run were the lucky ones. The sharp white teeth of the wolf snapped the thin necks of the remaining dogs as if they were nothing but little twigs. </p><p>Within less than a few seconds there was nothing but absolute silence and yet Sansa didn\u2019t dare to move. What if the wolf had only saved her because he wanted her for himself? What if he had simply chased away the dogs because he himself was hungry? What if the danger was far from gone now? What if it had only gotten worse? Much worse?</p><p>Once more Sansa closed her eyes and once more she prayed. \u201cDear Gods, both the old and the new. Please, help me get out of this\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy lady?\u201d Sansa\u2019s eyes flashed open again and right under the tree in which she was hiding now stood a handsome young man with dark black curls tied into a bun on the back of his head. He was wearing nothing but a pair of ripped pants and his naked skin was covered in sweat and gleaming. His dark eyes were looking up at her and slowly he stretched out his hand. \u201cDo you want a hand to come down?\u201d</p><p>Sansa stopped breathing. She had her eyes wide open and yet she couldn\u2019t make sense of what had happened. \u201cWhere\u2019s the white wolf?\u201d She whispered. Her throat was dry and her entire body started trembling. \u201cDid you kill it? Did it run away?\u201d She swallowed. \u201cI swear, there was a white wolf here. He chased the dogs away and\u2026\u201d </p><p>A small smile appeared on the stranger\u2019s face. He had a deep frown on his forehead and yet there was something about him that made her feel safe and at ease. \u201cThe big bad wolf is gone for now.\u201d He stretched out his hand even further, but she was still out of reach. \u201cI promise he won\u2019t hurt you. I won\u2019t let him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d Sansa still didn\u2019t move. Instead she wrapped her arms around her trembling body to make sure she wouldn\u2019t lose her balance and fall down. \u201cHow do I know I can trust you?\u201d</p><p>The stranger dropped his arm and the smile on his face faltered. \u201cI can\u2019t blame you for not trusting me, lady Sansa.\u201d He paused and it took her a few moments to realise he had used her name. \u201cI\u2019ve been trying to find a way to get you out of his claws ever since I saw you at the ball, three months ago.\u201d </p><p>Sansa blinked a few times. She could barely remember the ball, let alone the people who had attended. But she had never gotten the impression before that anyone knew that she longed to be saved and rescued. \u201cHow did you know I\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour smile might have fooled most people, but not me.\u201d The stranger let out a deep sigh. \u201cYou looked pretty, but it was as if I was looking at a puppet.\u201d He clenched his jaws. \u201cAnd I knew right away who was pulling the strings.\u201d He locked his glance with hers. \u201cI\u2019m glad you got away from him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlmost.\u201d Sansa shook her head. \u201cI almost got away from him. If that wolf hadn\u2019t appeared\u2026\u201d She shivered once more. \u201cIt seems that in the end he was the one to find a way to save me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou saved yourself, princess.\u201d The stranger smiled at her again. \u201cBecause you had courage and faith. You ran away, very well knowing what the risks were. You shouldn\u2019t give me all the credits. You should give most of them to yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d Sansa licked her dry lips and then slowly her mind started to make sense of what had happened. And even though she should be terrified. And even though she should only distrust him more, she couldn\u2019t help but smiling back at him. \u201cI still want to thank you.\u201d She climbed down again until she was within reach of his strong arms to help her to the ground.</p><p>\u201cJon, Jon Snow.\u201d He bowed and bent his head. \u201cAnd the pleasure is all mine, princess.\u201d He looked up again and now she saw the hint of red in his eyes, hidden behind their natural darkness. \u201cWhere will you go now?\u201d</p><p>Sansa shook her head. \u201cWhere we will go now?\u201d She reached for his hand and pulled him closer towards her. \u201cI might have found the courage and faith to run away, but I could use someone like you looking out for me anyway. You never know if and when the dogs might come back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be my honour, princess.\u201d Jon bowed once more. \u201cWhere will we go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnywhere. Everywhere. Somewhere safe.\u201d </p>",

She didn&rsquo;t dare to think about what he would do.</p><p>Would he simply drag her back to his castle? Would he act like nothing had happened? Would he play the caring and loving husband in front of everyone else, while coming up with new ways to assault her once there was no-one there anymore to see that he was actually a sadistic monster? Or would he order his dogs to eat her alive, to rip the flesh from her bones and to leave her remains to rot away?</p><p>&ldquo;Dear Gods, both the old and the new, if you exist and even care the least bit about me, please&hellip;&rdquo; Sansa whispered. &ldquo;Please, find a way to save me from whatever faith Ramsay Bolton has in mind for me.&rdquo;</p><p>A loud and deafening howl of a wolf echoed through the forest and quickly Sansa opened her eyes again. A few trees away from the one she was hiding in appeared a large shadow. The white wolf was at least three times as big as the dogs and his fiery red eyes stared at the little puppies while he kept on howling.</p><p>One by one the dogs went silent and motionless. Some of them whined barely hearable while they laid flat on the muddy ground, others ran away before the white wolf could come any nearer. The ones who had decided to run were the lucky ones. The sharp white teeth of the wolf snapped the thin necks of the remaining dogs as if they were nothing but little twigs. </p><p>Within less than a few seconds there was nothing but absolute silence and yet Sansa didn&rsquo;t dare to move. What if the wolf had only saved her because he wanted her for himself? What if he had simply chased away the dogs because he himself was hungry? What if the danger was far from gone now? What if it had only gotten worse? Much worse?</p><p>Once more Sansa closed her eyes and once more she prayed. &ldquo;Dear Gods, both the old and the new. Please, help me get out of this&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;My lady?&rdquo; Sansa&rsquo;s eyes flashed open again and right under the tree in which she was hiding now stood a handsome young man with dark black curls tied into a bun on the back of his head. He was wearing nothing but a pair of ripped pants and his naked skin was covered in sweat and gleaming. His dark eyes were looking up at her and slowly he stretched out his hand. &ldquo;Do you want a hand to come down?&rdquo;</p><p>Sansa stopped breathing. She had her eyes wide open and yet she couldn&rsquo;t make sense of what had happened. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the white wolf?&rdquo; She whispered. Her throat was dry and her entire body started trembling. &ldquo;Did you kill it? Did it run away?&rdquo; She swallowed. &ldquo;I swear, there was a white wolf here. He chased the dogs away and&hellip;&rdquo; </p><p>A small smile appeared on the stranger&rsquo;s face. He had a deep frown on his forehead and yet there was something about him that made her feel safe and at ease. &ldquo;The big bad wolf is gone for now.&rdquo; He stretched out his hand even further, but she was still out of reach. &ldquo;I promise he won&rsquo;t hurt you. I won&rsquo;t let him.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; Sansa still didn&rsquo;t move. Instead she wrapped her arms around her trembling body to make sure she wouldn&rsquo;t lose her balance and fall down. &ldquo;How do I know I can trust you?&rdquo;</p><p>The stranger dropped his arm and the smile on his face faltered. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t blame you for not trusting me, lady Sansa.&rdquo; He paused and it took her a few moments to realise he had used her name. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been trying to find a way to get you out of his claws ever since I saw you at the ball, three months ago.&rdquo; </p><p>Sansa blinked a few times. She could barely remember the ball, let alone the people who had attended. But she had never gotten the impression before that anyone knew that she longed to be saved and rescued. &ldquo;How did you know I&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Your smile might have fooled most people, but not me.&rdquo; The stranger let out a deep sigh. &ldquo;You looked pretty, but it was as if I was looking at a puppet.&rdquo; He clenched his jaws. &ldquo;And I knew right away who was pulling the strings.&rdquo; He locked his glance with hers. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you got away from him.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Almost.&rdquo; Sansa shook her head. &ldquo;I almost got away from him. If that wolf hadn&rsquo;t appeared&hellip;&rdquo; She shivered once more. &ldquo;It seems that in the end he was the one to find a way to save me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You saved yourself, princess.&rdquo; The stranger smiled at her again. &ldquo;Because you had courage and faith. You ran away, very well knowing what the risks were. You shouldn&rsquo;t give me all the credits. You should give most of them to yourself.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Me?&rdquo; Sansa licked her dry lips and then slowly her mind started to make sense of what had happened. And even though she should be terrified. And even though she should only distrust him more, she couldn&rsquo;t help but smiling back at him. &ldquo;I still want to thank you.&rdquo; She climbed down again until she was within reach of his strong arms to help her to the ground.</p><p>&ldquo;Jon, Jon Snow.&rdquo; He bowed and bent his head. &ldquo;And the pleasure is all mine, princess.&rdquo; He looked up again and now she saw the hint of red in his eyes, hidden behind their natural darkness. &ldquo;Where will you go now?&rdquo;</p><p>Sansa shook her head. &ldquo;Where we will go now?&rdquo; She reached for his hand and pulled him closer towards her. &ldquo;I might have found the courage and faith to run away, but I could use someone like you looking out for me anyway. You never know if and when the dogs might come back.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That would be my honour, princess.&rdquo; Jon bowed once more. &ldquo;Where will we go?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Anywhere. Everywhere. Somewhere safe.&rdquo; </p>",

Every few steps she almost tripped over her own feet. All her muscles were aching and she felt sharp stitches in her side, but she kept on running. The faster she ran, the further she would get before Ramsay would discover that she was gone. And the further away she was when he would discover that his wife was missing, the bigger the chance that she was gonna survive this.</p>\n<p>She had no idea where she was going exactly. This was not the execution of some masterplan that had been thought out carefully and had taken months to prepare. She was simply grabbing a once in a lifetime chance.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I have an important meeting to attend, my lady. I will be gone for a few hours, but I assume you will have no trouble entertaining yourself for a little while, will you?&rdquo; He had really thought he had broken her spirit, her will to flee, her hatred for him. He had really thought he could leave her alone, without guards watching her every step, without his dogs sitting in front of her door with orders to harm her when needed. </p>\n<p>And she had gathered a small basket, some food and water and some clothes and had started running. Because no matter how this story would end, there was no way it could get any worse than her life with Ramsay had been.</p>\n<p>A shiver rolled down her spine when she heard the barking of dogs coming from the woods behind her. She had no idea how much time had passed since she had left, but she didn&rsquo;t doubt whose dogs were chasing her. Quickly she used her scarf to tie her basket on her back and then she climbed in the nearest tree.</p>\n<p>She had barely reached a branch out of reach when she saw the dogs rushing towards her hiding place. Saliva dripped from their beaks and their sharp teeth glimmered in the evening sun. They pressed their paws against the trunk and barked louder and louder. </p>\n</p>",
