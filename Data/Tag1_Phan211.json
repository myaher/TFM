Though, if nothing else, it gave him an excuse to cocoon into his hoodie as he walked through Manchester. Catching his reflection in a shop window, he noticed the bright green of the fabric and swore under his breath, wishing York University had gone with more subtle colors. He briefly considered slipping back into the flat to change, but he was already ten minutes from home and decided it wasn\u2019t worth the extra trip. For someone that had built a brand on never going outside, he had found himself taking solace in these walks through the city he called home, music blaring in his ears and allowing him to check out of reality.</p><p>Did his walks happen to coincide with Charlotte\u2019s visits to their home? Maybe, but that was hardly worth addressing. If anything, Phil should be grateful he was being such a good friend and giving him space in such times. He\u2019s been keeping to himself and staying out of the way, anyone should be so lucky to have such a scarcely-present housemate.</p><p>Then why the <i>fuck</i> was he calling him right now?</p><p>Dan rolled his eyes, pulling his phone out from his pocket. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d it had better be something urgent, he thought. It was hard to clear his head when the source of the clutter kept reestablishing its presence.</p><p>\u201cHey, uh, we\u2019re ordering Indian takeaway. Do you want anything?\u201d</p><p>Oh, Phil had to be kidding him, Dan thought. He pinched the bridge of his nose and let out a breath. \u201cSure, just\u2026just get my usual, okay? Thanks,\u201d he answered, hanging up after exchanging goodbyes. He stared up at the sky for a moment, then turned on his heel to trek back to the flat. No point in letting his food just sit there.</p><!-- more --><p>But when Dan was sitting and eating dinner with Phil and Charlotte, he found himself wishing he had declined Phil\u2019s offer. It wasn\u2019t that they were being affectionate or handsy, it was that it felt awkward. There was a thick tension in the room that no amount of casual conversation or bad jokes could get rid of.</p><p>\u201cYou guys are headed to the states soon? Should be fun,\u201d Charlotte broke another bout of silence as she picked at her meal.</p><p>\u201cYeah, first Vegas then Los Angeles, we\u2019re looking forward to it,\u201d Phil confirmed. \u201cGonna be a wild time celebrating Dan\u2019s birthday in Sin City,\u201d he added with a grin.</p><p>Dan\u2019s brow quirked \u2013 that wasn\u2019t the sort of thing you announce in front of your girlfriend, even if you weren\u2019t especially exclusive. \u201cI mean, we\u2019ve never been to Vegas before. It\u2019ll be cool to take in the sights and all that,\u201d although he was talking to Charlotte, his gaze was on Phil, an incredulous expression \u2013 because what exactly was he trying to imply to her?</p><p>Phil may put on a na\u00efve, innocent personality in front of the camera \u2013 keep everything PG, act oblivious to innuendos, but that was his AmazingPhil persona. Phil Lester is a twenty-five-year-old adult man, who makes dirty jokes, drinks alcohol, and has sex. Dan was certain he knew how he came across, he just didn\u2019t quite understand <i>why</i>.</p><p><b>6/20/12 \u2013 2:18 PM</b></p><p>Visiting Charlotte\u2019s flat often felt like visiting a relative \u2013 Phil was never quite sure how comfortable he should allow himself to get, no matter how warm and inviting it was. He wouldn\u2019t take his shoes off until instructed to, he didn\u2019t touch much of anything, he even used the guest towels when in the bathroom. No matter how often he frequented her home \u2013 admittedly less often than the other way around \u2013 he didn\u2019t feel at ease.</p><p>He supposed that made the \u2018we need to talk\u2019 text that landed him here inevitable.</p><p>Sitting and waiting for the conversation to transpire made Phil feel like a child waiting to be scolded. It didn\u2019t take a master of perception to know where this was headed, and all he could do was brace himself for it. He chewed on his lip and fidgeted with his fingers, looking at the floor until Charlotte sat down beside him.</p><p>\u201cDoes Dan know that you\u2019re in love with him?\u201d</p><p>Phil sat upright and blinked. He knew Charlotte to be blunt, but that was far from the breakup line that he was anticipating. He wanted to be indignant \u2013 how <i>dare</i> she make such an accusation? His voice, however, completely escaped him when he opened his mouth to speak, his mouth ran dry and his tongue was taking up too much room.</p><p>\u201cDo <i>you</i> know that you\u2019re in love with him?\u201d</p><p>His heart was pounding, and his stomach was knotting up. Sweat was beading up on his forehead and his cheeks flushed pink. \u201cIt\u2019s more complicated than that,\u201d he finally told her. And it was truly the best answer he could muster. He spent so long eradicating the word \u2018love\u2019 from his vocabulary, hearing it now felt foreign. It was too strong, too concrete. \u201cOur whole relationship is more complicated than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, I get complicated. Life is complicated,\u201d Charlotte\u2019s tone was calm, far from the anger he had been preparing for. \u201cBut I\u2019m not here to play the role of a distraction while you sort yourself out. I deserve someone that can give me one hundred percent of their heart, not one little room in the back of it,\u201d she paused for a moment. \u201cAnd you deserve to be happy, too. You\u2019re undoubtedly the nicest, most caring guy I\u2019ve ever dated. But god, you stopped in the middle of sex to answer a phone call from him. It\u2019s pretty clear where your priorities are.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t wrong, they both knew that. Phil felt guilty, there was no good excuse for stringing her along like that. He sighed, letting his eyes drift downward. \u201cSo, you\u2019re saying\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat I\u2019m breaking up with you, yes.\u201d</p><p>Phil nodded and got up, deciding there was nothing else to say. He wasn\u2019t mad at her, but he was frustrated, perhaps more with himself than anyone else. \u201cI better go,\u201d he mumbled, leaving her flat with his tail between his legs. He didn\u2019t even hear whatever Dan had called out to him upon his return, he just wanted to finish packing in peace. Vegas couldn\u2019t come soon enough.</p><p><b>6/23/12 \u2013 8:12 PM</b></p><p>Vegas was truly a captivating place. The lights, the sounds, the dubiously ethical activities \u2013 there was so much for them to take in, they hardly knew where to begin. The first couple days had gone well, sightseeing had proven to be a welcome distraction, and the joint liveshow had \u2013 they hoped \u2013 temporarily quelled the viewers\u2019 need for content. That left them with the rest of their trip free, though they planned to film as much as they could.</p><p>Presently, they were in one of the several restaurant-casino combos on the strip, enjoying the overindulgence that was American cuisine.</p><p>\u201cI just want to pack this up and bring it back home, eat it and relive how good this is,\u201d Dan remarked with his mouth full.</p><p>Phil nodded in agreement, but it didn\u2019t quite absolve him of his \u2018off\u2019 behavior. A few cocktails had gotten him close to a better mood, but he had been stewing in his thoughts since his breakup. He knew Dan knew as well, and his best friend\u2019s lack of attempts to talk to him about it was not helping.</p><p>\u201cSomething still bugging you?\u201d Dan had been operating under the idea that Phil would want to recover from the incident with Charlotte without him. His interference would only make things worse, he thought \u2013 which had been a contrast from his usual propensity to push himself into other people\u2019s problems to ignore his own.</p><p>After finishing his drink and signaling for another, Phil answered. \u201cI\u2019m bouncing back from getting dumped, Dan,\u201d he blinked and shook his head \u2013 the drinks had been so sweet and fruity, it was easy for him to forget how much alcohol was in there.</p><p>Dan frowned. \u201cI thought you didn\u2019t even like her that much. You wouldn\u2019t have kept cancelling dates if you really fancied her,\u201d he pointed out.</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t make it feel any better!\u201d he huffed, the outburst stunning both of them into silence, which carried through the rest of the meal.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna try my hand at the slots,\u201d Phil announced, taking what was either his fourth or fifth drink with him, while Dan meandered over to the bar.</p><p>Even without being next to each other, tension continued to build. Trying to squash their feelings with alcoholic drink after drink only did so much. The music was blaring, and the lights were bright, all their senses were in a constant state of over-stimulation, most certainly making things worse. But they only existed apart for a couple hours, stumbling to the fa\u00e7ade of the building to wait for a cab back to the hotel.</p><p>\u201cDid you win?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never fucking win.\u201d</p><p>Dan rolled his eyes and let out a dry laugh. \u201cWow, testy today, aren\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, shut up!\u201d Phil\u2019s voice took on a rare, harsh tone, one he almost never had while sober. He got out after the cab came to a stop, and they both made their way out and into the hotel. \u201cWhat the hell is your problem?\u201d he asked, trying to keep up with his brisk pace without falling, catching his breath when they made it to the elevator.</p><p>Phil glared at Dan, suddenly hating being stuck in close quarters with him \u2013 be it only for a moment, until they were let out on their floor. His blood was boiling, and he barely saw straight enough to let them into the room. \u201cYou want to know what my problem is? My problem is I can\u2019t live my fucking life because I\u2019ve built it around you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow is that my fault? I\u2019m just trying to be successful, so we can both stay afloat!\u201d Sober Dan probably would have taken responsibility for this, but drunk Dan was looking for a reason to fight. \u201cYou get hung up on every little thing that doesn\u2019t go your way, you can\u2019t expect everyone to live their lives the way you want them to!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re not even trying! I thought we were a team, you won\u2019t even consider meeting me in the middle \u2018cause you have your paranoid head shoved up your ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I have my head up my ass? At least I\u2019m trying to live my life and not dwelling on what you want us to be,\u201d Dan and Phil were in each other\u2019s faces, getting louder with each rebuttal despite the lack of necessity.</p><p>Phil stared him down and grit his teeth. \u201cWhy are you so afraid of how you feel about me?\u201d he wasn\u2019t shouting anymore, but his tone was sharp and biting.</p><p>Dan scoffed. \u201cGet over yourself, I have nothing to be afraid of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProve it.\u201d</p><p>It was a split-second decision fueled by passion and alcohol. Dan kissed Phil heatedly, hands fisting into the fabric of his shirt. They both reeked of booze and were struggling to hold each other up, leading them to stumble backwards until they fell on to Dan\u2019s bed. Their hands roamed each other\u2019s bodies, as if they were discovering each other for the first time.</p><p>Phil was the one to break the kiss, but only to strip himself and Dan of their shirts, tossing them off the bed. He quickly leaned back in, trailing his lips along Dan\u2019s jaw and down his neck, leaving one hickey after another and relishing the breathy moans that escaped. Normally he would have been chastised for marking him up so visibly, but Dan was too far gone to stop him. He was rougher with him this time, unceremoniously yanking his jeans down and letting them fall to the wayside. Phil ran his hand over Dan\u2019s crotch, feeling his cock strain against his boxer-briefs. \u201cHard already?\u201d</p><p>Dan let out a grunt, muttering \u201cShut up,\u201d only to have a sharp gasp follow as Phil gave his inner thigh a firm slap.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve had it with your fucking mouth,\u201d Phil snapped as he stripped down. He looked over and moved to rifle through the bedside drawer. \u201cOf course, you have lube, couldn\u2019t keep it in your pants for a week if you tried,\u201d he didn\u2019t give Dan the chance to offer an indignant response, pushing his hand under the waistband of his underwear and wrapping it around the base of his cock. He gave it a few slow, firm strokes, watching his face contort in arousal.</p><p>Already known for being a horny drunk, Dan could hardly think straight with Phil touching him and talking to him in that low, sexy voice that only came out right before sex. As stubborn and defiant as he\u2019d been lately, Phil reduced him to putty far more easily than he would ever admit. \u201cYou gonna use it or what?\u201d</p><p>Phil removed his hand from Dan\u2019s pants, finally discarding them with the rest of their clothes. \u201cGod, you\u2019re such a brat,\u201d he rolled him on to his stomach, squeezing his ass before spanking it. \u201cGuess I better fuck you like one, hm?\u201d when he didn\u2019t get an answer, he struck his ass again. \u201cAnswer me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Dan grunted. \u201cNeed you to fuck me,\u201d he finally gave himself over to his desires, to what he once eagerly anticipated on a near daily basis.</p><p>\u201cBecause <i>why</i>?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m being a brat.\u201d</p><p>Phil grinned triumphantly, popping the cap on the lube bottle open and slicking up two fingers. He got a firm grip on Dan\u2019s waist with his other hand, getting him up on his hands and knees before pushing his first finger past the tight ring of muscle, adding the second soon after. It wasn\u2019t long before he was pumping his fingers steadily, curving them at different angles each time. By the time he added his third finger, Dan was a desperate, writhing mess beneath him, a sight he had longed to see.</p><p>\u201cC\u2019mon Phil, please. Please, I need your cock. Want you to fuck me hard,\u201d it had been so long since Dan had begged like that, his words sending arousal straight to Phil\u2019s groin. He didn\u2019t have to wait much longer, the empty sensation promptly replaced by such a pleasured, full one that elicited loud, eager moans from him.</p><p>\u201cKnew you missed this, always such a slut for my cock,\u201d Phil couldn\u2019t cover the smugness in his tone. Hearing and feeling Dan want him felt nearly as good as the sex itself. His grip on Dan\u2019s hips tightened, pulling their bodies to slam together with each thrust until he let one hand move forward to work his length in tandem with his thrusts.</p><p>And truth be told, Dan did miss this. Not just the sex, that was just at the forefront of his clouded brain. Being underneath Phil, his body yielding to his movements, brought a warmth and familiarity into the hotel bed. And feeling Phil\u2019s hand around him brought a warmth into the pit of his stomach that grew into a hot wave of lust that overtook him. He moaned out, hitting his orgasm without warning.</p><p>But Phil wasn\u2019t done yet, keeping his firm hold on Dan as he fucked him through his orgasm, then through his own that followed shortly after. He didn\u2019t pull out until he was completely spent, letting himself fall backwards on to the bed as he caught his breath.</p><p>Dan scrambled under the covers, completely spent with his head swirling from the high of alcohol and sex. He almost felt like he should say something, but when he turned to see a completely knocked out Phil beside him, he let out a sigh of relief and dozed off as well.</p><p><b>6/30/12 \u2013 7:00 PM</b></p><p>Dan and Phil were relieved that VidCon was finally over. Don\u2019t get them wrong - they loved being able to meet and interact with their fans, but the past week had taken an emotional and physical toll on them \u2013 they were absolutely spent. Of course, this was all exacerbated by the fact that they had actively avoided addressing the events of their drunken night.</p><p>It hadn\u2019t been easy, though. Dan\u2019s neck had been littered with deep, purple marks that took over a full day of healing before he could convincingly cover them up. That cost them a day of filming, and the rest of their footage wasn\u2019t of the quality they normally strived for. Dan had no desire to upload any of it, but he had made a promise to deliver, and he wanted to follow through. He couldn\u2019t even fault Phil for it, especially since getting mad at him over it would require rehashing that night.</p><p>But now they were just left with each other in their hotel room. Their bags were packed in preparation for an early morning flight, leaving them to sit in silence and do next to nothing. Phil was the one to finally approach the subject, saying \u201cWe should talk about what happened that night,\u201d he didn\u2019t have to specify which night, Dan\u2019s tensed up reaction made it clear he knew exactly what he was referring to.</p><p>\u201cDo we, though? Like, do we actually?\u201d even he knew the answer was yes, but he was more than willing to put it off for as long as he possibly could.</p><p>\u201cYes, actually,\u201d Phil rolled his eyes. \u201cWe had sex, Dan. We had sex a week before the biggest YouTube event of the year. And I think it\u2019s because we\u2019ve been building up to it, it was inevitable.\u201d</p><p>Dan let out an exasperated sigh. \u201cBut what does it matter? We got drunk and hooked up, we had good sex when we were together, so we wanted some more without our inhibitions,\u201d he wasn\u2019t sure what he was trying to defend himself from, but he felt on edge, put on the spot. At the same time, he felt weak, like admitting that he wanted what had happened meant he couldn\u2019t keep to his resolve of maintaining a platonic relationship with Phil.</p><p>\u201cIt matters because we still have feelings for each other, and it\u2019s not fair to keep denying it,\u201d it was difficult for Phil to not take Dan\u2019s distancing from him as a personal rejection, no matter how many times they told themselves it was for the best.</p><p>\u201cSo, maybe we do,\u201d he sighed, catching Phil off guard. \u201cMaybe we never stopped having feelings for each other and you wasted a barista\u2019s time for months. But what are we supposed to do? Let ourselves be branded as \u2018Dan and Phil, YouTube couple\u2019? The fans may be progressive but the people we\u2019re looking to sponsor and employ us don\u2019t want that. They want the two guys with the emo hair that pal around in front of a camera.\u201d</p><p>Phil nodded as he listened. He had to admit, this was the most rational Dan\u2019s argument had sounded since he first started making it. If they wanted to make it in the mainstream media, it might not be such a bad idea to play it safe with how they presented themselves and presenting themselves as an openly queer couple was a risk that they couldn\u2019t afford to take. \u201cFine, maybe we can\u2019t let anyone know. But can we stop pretending behind closed doors? Can we stop trying to distract ourselves with hookups and dates and just be with each other?\u201d</p><p>Dan was quiet, pressing his lips into a fine line.

No point in letting his food just sit there.</p>[[MORE]]<p>But when Dan was sitting and eating dinner with Phil and Charlotte, he found himself wishing he had declined Phil\u2019s offer. It wasn\u2019t that they were being affectionate or handsy, it was that it felt awkward. There was a thick tension in the room that no amount of casual conversation or bad jokes could get rid of.</p><p>\u201cYou guys are headed to the states soon? Should be fun,\u201d Charlotte broke another bout of silence as she picked at her meal.</p><p>\u201cYeah, first Vegas then Los Angeles, we\u2019re looking forward to it,\u201d Phil confirmed. \u201cGonna be a wild time celebrating Dan\u2019s birthday in Sin City,\u201d he added with a grin.</p><p>Dan\u2019s brow quirked \u2013 that wasn\u2019t the sort of thing you announce in front of your girlfriend, even if you weren\u2019t especially exclusive. \u201cI mean, we\u2019ve never been to Vegas before. It\u2019ll be cool to take in the sights and all that,\u201d although he was talking to Charlotte, his gaze was on Phil, an incredulous expression \u2013 because what exactly was he trying to imply to her?</p><p>Phil may put on a na\u00efve, innocent personality in front of the camera \u2013 keep everything PG, act oblivious to innuendos, but that was his AmazingPhil persona. Phil Lester is a twenty-five-year-old adult man, who makes dirty jokes, drinks alcohol, and has sex. Dan was certain he knew how he came across, he just didn\u2019t quite understand <i>why</i>.</p><p><b>6/20/12 \u2013 2:18 PM</b></p><p>Visiting Charlotte\u2019s flat often felt like visiting a relative \u2013 Phil was never quite sure how comfortable he should allow himself to get, no matter how warm and inviting it was. He wouldn\u2019t take his shoes off until instructed to, he didn\u2019t touch much of anything, he even used the guest towels when in the bathroom. No matter how often he frequented her home \u2013 admittedly less often than the other way around \u2013 he didn\u2019t feel at ease.</p><p>He supposed that made the \u2018we need to talk\u2019 text that landed him here inevitable.</p><p>Sitting and waiting for the conversation to transpire made Phil feel like a child waiting to be scolded. It didn\u2019t take a master of perception to know where this was headed, and all he could do was brace himself for it. He chewed on his lip and fidgeted with his fingers, looking at the floor until Charlotte sat down beside him.</p><p>\u201cDoes Dan know that you\u2019re in love with him?\u201d</p><p>Phil sat upright and blinked. He knew Charlotte to be blunt, but that was far from the breakup line that he was anticipating. He wanted to be indignant \u2013 how <i>dare</i> she make such an accusation? His voice, however, completely escaped him when he opened his mouth to speak, his mouth ran dry and his tongue was taking up too much room.</p><p>\u201cDo <i>you</i> know that you\u2019re in love with him?\u201d</p><p>His heart was pounding, and his stomach was knotting up. Sweat was beading up on his forehead and his cheeks flushed pink. \u201cIt\u2019s more complicated than that,\u201d he finally told her. And it was truly the best answer he could muster. He spent so long eradicating the word \u2018love\u2019 from his vocabulary, hearing it now felt foreign. It was too strong, too concrete. \u201cOur whole relationship is more complicated than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, I get complicated. Life is complicated,\u201d Charlotte\u2019s tone was calm, far from the anger he had been preparing for. \u201cBut I\u2019m not here to play the role of a distraction while you sort yourself out. I deserve someone that can give me one hundred percent of their heart, not one little room in the back of it,\u201d she paused for a moment. \u201cAnd you deserve to be happy, too. You\u2019re undoubtedly the nicest, most caring guy I\u2019ve ever dated. But god, you stopped in the middle of sex to answer a phone call from him. It\u2019s pretty clear where your priorities are.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t wrong, they both knew that. Phil felt guilty, there was no good excuse for stringing her along like that. He sighed, letting his eyes drift downward. \u201cSo, you\u2019re saying\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat I\u2019m breaking up with you, yes.\u201d</p><p>Phil nodded and got up, deciding there was nothing else to say. He wasn\u2019t mad at her, but he was frustrated, perhaps more with himself than anyone else. \u201cI better go,\u201d he mumbled, leaving her flat with his tail between his legs. He didn\u2019t even hear whatever Dan had called out to him upon his return, he just wanted to finish packing in peace. Vegas couldn\u2019t come soon enough.</p><p><b>6/23/12 \u2013 8:12 PM</b></p><p>Vegas was truly a captivating place. The lights, the sounds, the dubiously ethical activities \u2013 there was so much for them to take in, they hardly knew where to begin. The first couple days had gone well, sightseeing had proven to be a welcome distraction, and the joint liveshow had \u2013 they hoped \u2013 temporarily quelled the viewers\u2019 need for content. That left them with the rest of their trip free, though they planned to film as much as they could.</p><p>Presently, they were in one of the several restaurant-casino combos on the strip, enjoying the overindulgence that was American cuisine.</p><p>\u201cI just want to pack this up and bring it back home, eat it and relive how good this is,\u201d Dan remarked with his mouth full.</p><p>Phil nodded in agreement, but it didn\u2019t quite absolve him of his \u2018off\u2019 behavior. A few cocktails had gotten him close to a better mood, but he had been stewing in his thoughts since his breakup. He knew Dan knew as well, and his best friend\u2019s lack of attempts to talk to him about it was not helping.</p><p>\u201cSomething still bugging you?\u201d Dan had been operating under the idea that Phil would want to recover from the incident with Charlotte without him. His interference would only make things worse, he thought \u2013 which had been a contrast from his usual propensity to push himself into other people\u2019s problems to ignore his own.</p><p>After finishing his drink and signaling for another, Phil answered. \u201cI\u2019m bouncing back from getting dumped, Dan,\u201d he blinked and shook his head \u2013 the drinks had been so sweet and fruity, it was easy for him to forget how much alcohol was in there.</p><p>Dan frowned. \u201cI thought you didn\u2019t even like her that much. You wouldn\u2019t have kept cancelling dates if you really fancied her,\u201d he pointed out.</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t make it feel any better!\u201d he huffed, the outburst stunning both of them into silence, which carried through the rest of the meal.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna try my hand at the slots,\u201d Phil announced, taking what was either his fourth or fifth drink with him, while Dan meandered over to the bar.</p><p>Even without being next to each other, tension continued to build. Trying to squash their feelings with alcoholic drink after drink only did so much. The music was blaring, and the lights were bright, all their senses were in a constant state of over-stimulation, most certainly making things worse. But they only existed apart for a couple hours, stumbling to the fa\u00e7ade of the building to wait for a cab back to the hotel.</p><p>\u201cDid you win?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never fucking win.\u201d</p><p>Dan rolled his eyes and let out a dry laugh. \u201cWow, testy today, aren\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, shut up!\u201d Phil\u2019s voice took on a rare, harsh tone, one he almost never had while sober. He got out after the cab came to a stop, and they both made their way out and into the hotel. \u201cWhat the hell is your problem?\u201d he asked, trying to keep up with his brisk pace without falling, catching his breath when they made it to the elevator.</p><p>Phil glared at Dan, suddenly hating being stuck in close quarters with him \u2013 be it only for a moment, until they were let out on their floor. His blood was boiling, and he barely saw straight enough to let them into the room. \u201cYou want to know what my problem is? My problem is I can\u2019t live my fucking life because I\u2019ve built it around you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow is that my fault? I\u2019m just trying to be successful, so we can both stay afloat!\u201d Sober Dan probably would have taken responsibility for this, but drunk Dan was looking for a reason to fight. \u201cYou get hung up on every little thing that doesn\u2019t go your way, you can\u2019t expect everyone to live their lives the way you want them to!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re not even trying! I thought we were a team, you won\u2019t even consider meeting me in the middle \u2018cause you have your paranoid head shoved up your ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I have my head up my ass? At least I\u2019m trying to live my life and not dwelling on what you want us to be,\u201d Dan and Phil were in each other\u2019s faces, getting louder with each rebuttal despite the lack of necessity.</p><p>Phil stared him down and grit his teeth. \u201cWhy are you so afraid of how you feel about me?\u201d he wasn\u2019t shouting anymore, but his tone was sharp and biting.</p><p>Dan scoffed. \u201cGet over yourself, I have nothing to be afraid of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProve it.\u201d</p><p>It was a split-second decision fueled by passion and alcohol. Dan kissed Phil heatedly, hands fisting into the fabric of his shirt. They both reeked of booze and were struggling to hold each other up, leading them to stumble backwards until they fell on to Dan\u2019s bed. Their hands roamed each other\u2019s bodies, as if they were discovering each other for the first time.</p><p>Phil was the one to break the kiss, but only to strip himself and Dan of their shirts, tossing them off the bed. He quickly leaned back in, trailing his lips along Dan\u2019s jaw and down his neck, leaving one hickey after another and relishing the breathy moans that escaped. Normally he would have been chastised for marking him up so visibly, but Dan was too far gone to stop him. He was rougher with him this time, unceremoniously yanking his jeans down and letting them fall to the wayside. Phil ran his hand over Dan\u2019s crotch, feeling his cock strain against his boxer-briefs. \u201cHard already?\u201d</p><p>Dan let out a grunt, muttering \u201cShut up,\u201d only to have a sharp gasp follow as Phil gave his inner thigh a firm slap.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve had it with your fucking mouth,\u201d Phil snapped as he stripped down. He looked over and moved to rifle through the bedside drawer. \u201cOf course, you have lube, couldn\u2019t keep it in your pants for a week if you tried,\u201d he didn\u2019t give Dan the chance to offer an indignant response, pushing his hand under the waistband of his underwear and wrapping it around the base of his cock. He gave it a few slow, firm strokes, watching his face contort in arousal.</p><p>Already known for being a horny drunk, Dan could hardly think straight with Phil touching him and talking to him in that low, sexy voice that only came out right before sex. As stubborn and defiant as he\u2019d been lately, Phil reduced him to putty far more easily than he would ever admit. \u201cYou gonna use it or what?\u201d</p><p>Phil removed his hand from Dan\u2019s pants, finally discarding them with the rest of their clothes. \u201cGod, you\u2019re such a brat,\u201d he rolled him on to his stomach, squeezing his ass before spanking it. \u201cGuess I better fuck you like one, hm?\u201d when he didn\u2019t get an answer, he struck his ass again. \u201cAnswer me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Dan grunted. \u201cNeed you to fuck me,\u201d he finally gave himself over to his desires, to what he once eagerly anticipated on a near daily basis.</p><p>\u201cBecause <i>why</i>?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m being a brat.\u201d</p><p>Phil grinned triumphantly, popping the cap on the lube bottle open and slicking up two fingers. He got a firm grip on Dan\u2019s waist with his other hand, getting him up on his hands and knees before pushing his first finger past the tight ring of muscle, adding the second soon after. It wasn\u2019t long before he was pumping his fingers steadily, curving them at different angles each time. By the time he added his third finger, Dan was a desperate, writhing mess beneath him, a sight he had longed to see.</p><p>\u201cC\u2019mon Phil, please. Please, I need your cock. Want you to fuck me hard,\u201d it had been so long since Dan had begged like that, his words sending arousal straight to Phil\u2019s groin. He didn\u2019t have to wait much longer, the empty sensation promptly replaced by such a pleasured, full one that elicited loud, eager moans from him.</p><p>\u201cKnew you missed this, always such a slut for my cock,\u201d Phil couldn\u2019t cover the smugness in his tone. Hearing and feeling Dan want him felt nearly as good as the sex itself. His grip on Dan\u2019s hips tightened, pulling their bodies to slam together with each thrust until he let one hand move forward to work his length in tandem with his thrusts.</p><p>And truth be told, Dan did miss this. Not just the sex, that was just at the forefront of his clouded brain. Being underneath Phil, his body yielding to his movements, brought a warmth and familiarity into the hotel bed. And feeling Phil\u2019s hand around him brought a warmth into the pit of his stomach that grew into a hot wave of lust that overtook him. He moaned out, hitting his orgasm without warning.</p><p>But Phil wasn\u2019t done yet, keeping his firm hold on Dan as he fucked him through his orgasm, then through his own that followed shortly after. He didn\u2019t pull out until he was completely spent, letting himself fall backwards on to the bed as he caught his breath.</p><p>Dan scrambled under the covers, completely spent with his head swirling from the high of alcohol and sex. He almost felt like he should say something, but when he turned to see a completely knocked out Phil beside him, he let out a sigh of relief and dozed off as well.</p><p><b>6/30/12 \u2013 7:00 PM</b></p><p>Dan and Phil were relieved that VidCon was finally over. Don\u2019t get them wrong - they loved being able to meet and interact with their fans, but the past week had taken an emotional and physical toll on them \u2013 they were absolutely spent. Of course, this was all exacerbated by the fact that they had actively avoided addressing the events of their drunken night.</p><p>It hadn\u2019t been easy, though. Dan\u2019s neck had been littered with deep, purple marks that took over a full day of healing before he could convincingly cover them up. That cost them a day of filming, and the rest of their footage wasn\u2019t of the quality they normally strived for. Dan had no desire to upload any of it, but he had made a promise to deliver, and he wanted to follow through. He couldn\u2019t even fault Phil for it, especially since getting mad at him over it would require rehashing that night.</p><p>But now they were just left with each other in their hotel room. Their bags were packed in preparation for an early morning flight, leaving them to sit in silence and do next to nothing. Phil was the one to finally approach the subject, saying \u201cWe should talk about what happened that night,\u201d he didn\u2019t have to specify which night, Dan\u2019s tensed up reaction made it clear he knew exactly what he was referring to.</p><p>\u201cDo we, though? Like, do we actually?\u201d even he knew the answer was yes, but he was more than willing to put it off for as long as he possibly could.</p><p>\u201cYes, actually,\u201d Phil rolled his eyes. \u201cWe had sex, Dan. We had sex a week before the biggest YouTube event of the year. And I think it\u2019s because we\u2019ve been building up to it, it was inevitable.\u201d</p><p>Dan let out an exasperated sigh. \u201cBut what does it matter? We got drunk and hooked up, we had good sex when we were together, so we wanted some more without our inhibitions,\u201d he wasn\u2019t sure what he was trying to defend himself from, but he felt on edge, put on the spot. At the same time, he felt weak, like admitting that he wanted what had happened meant he couldn\u2019t keep to his resolve of maintaining a platonic relationship with Phil.</p><p>\u201cIt matters because we still have feelings for each other, and it\u2019s not fair to keep denying it,\u201d it was difficult for Phil to not take Dan\u2019s distancing from him as a personal rejection, no matter how many times they told themselves it was for the best.</p><p>\u201cSo, maybe we do,\u201d he sighed, catching Phil off guard. \u201cMaybe we never stopped having feelings for each other and you wasted a barista\u2019s time for months. But what are we supposed to do? Let ourselves be branded as \u2018Dan and Phil, YouTube couple\u2019? The fans may be progressive but the people we\u2019re looking to sponsor and employ us don\u2019t want that. They want the two guys with the emo hair that pal around in front of a camera.\u201d</p><p>Phil nodded as he listened. He had to admit, this was the most rational Dan\u2019s argument had sounded since he first started making it. If they wanted to make it in the mainstream media, it might not be such a bad idea to play it safe with how they presented themselves and presenting themselves as an openly queer couple was a risk that they couldn\u2019t afford to take. \u201cFine, maybe we can\u2019t let anyone know. But can we stop pretending behind closed doors? Can we stop trying to distract ourselves with hookups and dates and just be with each other?\u201d</p><p>Dan was quiet, pressing his lips into a fine line. He swallowed thickly, turning to look out the window. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p>",

Though, if nothing else, it gave him an excuse to cocoon into his hoodie as he walked through Manchester. Catching his reflection in a shop window, he noticed the bright green of the fabric and swore under his breath, wishing York University had gone with more subtle colors. He briefly considered slipping back into the flat to change, but he was already ten minutes from home and decided it wasn\u2019t worth the extra trip. For someone that had built a brand on never going outside, he had found himself taking solace in these walks through the city he called home, music blaring in his ears and allowing him to check out of reality.</p><p>Did his walks happen to coincide with Charlotte\u2019s visits to their home? Maybe, but that was hardly worth addressing. If anything, Phil should be grateful he was being such a good friend and giving him space in such times. He\u2019s been keeping to himself and staying out of the way, anyone should be so lucky to have such a scarcely-present housemate.</p><p>Then why the <i>fuck</i> was he calling him right now?</p><p>Dan rolled his eyes, pulling his phone out from his pocket. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d it had better be something urgent, he thought. It was hard to clear his head when the source of the clutter kept reestablishing its presence.</p><p>\u201cHey, uh, we\u2019re ordering Indian takeaway. Do you want anything?\u201d</p><p>Oh, Phil had to be kidding him, Dan thought. He pinched the bridge of his nose and let out a breath. \u201cSure, just\u2026just get my usual, okay? Thanks,\u201d he answered, hanging up after exchanging goodbyes. He stared up at the sky for a moment, then turned on his heel to trek back to the flat. No point in letting his food just sit there.</p>[[MORE]]<p>But when Dan was sitting and eating dinner with Phil and Charlotte, he found himself wishing he had declined Phil\u2019s offer. It wasn\u2019t that they were being affectionate or handsy, it was that it felt awkward. There was a thick tension in the room that no amount of casual conversation or bad jokes could get rid of.</p><p>\u201cYou guys are headed to the states soon? Should be fun,\u201d Charlotte broke another bout of silence as she picked at her meal.</p><p>\u201cYeah, first Vegas then Los Angeles, we\u2019re looking forward to it,\u201d Phil confirmed. \u201cGonna be a wild time celebrating Dan\u2019s birthday in Sin City,\u201d he added with a grin.</p><p>Dan\u2019s brow quirked \u2013 that wasn\u2019t the sort of thing you announce in front of your girlfriend, even if you weren\u2019t especially exclusive. \u201cI mean, we\u2019ve never been to Vegas before. It\u2019ll be cool to take in the sights and all that,\u201d although he was talking to Charlotte, his gaze was on Phil, an incredulous expression \u2013 because what exactly was he trying to imply to her?</p><p>Phil may put on a na\u00efve, innocent personality in front of the camera \u2013 keep everything PG, act oblivious to innuendos, but that was his AmazingPhil persona. Phil Lester is a twenty-five-year-old adult man, who makes dirty jokes, drinks alcohol, and has sex. Dan was certain he knew how he came across, he just didn\u2019t quite understand <i>why</i>.</p><p><b>6/20/12 \u2013 2:18 PM</b></p><p>Visiting Charlotte\u2019s flat often felt like visiting a relative \u2013 Phil was never quite sure how comfortable he should allow himself to get, no matter how warm and inviting it was. He wouldn\u2019t take his shoes off until instructed to, he didn\u2019t touch much of anything, he even used the guest towels when in the bathroom. No matter how often he frequented her home \u2013 admittedly less often than the other way around \u2013 he didn\u2019t feel at ease.</p><p>He supposed that made the \u2018we need to talk\u2019 text that landed him here inevitable.</p><p>Sitting and waiting for the conversation to transpire made Phil feel like a child waiting to be scolded. It didn\u2019t take a master of perception to know where this was headed, and all he could do was brace himself for it. He chewed on his lip and fidgeted with his fingers, looking at the floor until Charlotte sat down beside him.</p><p>\u201cDoes Dan know that you\u2019re in love with him?\u201d</p><p>Phil sat upright and blinked. He knew Charlotte to be blunt, but that was far from the breakup line that he was anticipating. He wanted to be indignant \u2013 how <i>dare</i> she make such an accusation? His voice, however, completely escaped him when he opened his mouth to speak, his mouth ran dry and his tongue was taking up too much room.</p><p>\u201cDo <i>you</i> know that you\u2019re in love with him?\u201d</p><p>His heart was pounding, and his stomach was knotting up. Sweat was beading up on his forehead and his cheeks flushed pink. \u201cIt\u2019s more complicated than that,\u201d he finally told her. And it was truly the best answer he could muster. He spent so long eradicating the word \u2018love\u2019 from his vocabulary, hearing it now felt foreign. It was too strong, too concrete. \u201cOur whole relationship is more complicated than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, I get complicated. Life is complicated,\u201d Charlotte\u2019s tone was calm, far from the anger he had been preparing for. \u201cBut I\u2019m not here to play the role of a distraction while you sort yourself out. I deserve someone that can give me one hundred percent of their heart, not one little room in the back of it,\u201d she paused for a moment. \u201cAnd you deserve to be happy, too. You\u2019re undoubtedly the nicest, most caring guy I\u2019ve ever dated. But god, you stopped in the middle of sex to answer a phone call from him. It\u2019s pretty clear where your priorities are.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t wrong, they both knew that. Phil felt guilty, there was no good excuse for stringing her along like that. He sighed, letting his eyes drift downward. \u201cSo, you\u2019re saying\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat I\u2019m breaking up with you, yes.\u201d</p><p>Phil nodded and got up, deciding there was nothing else to say. He wasn\u2019t mad at her, but he was frustrated, perhaps more with himself than anyone else. \u201cI better go,\u201d he mumbled, leaving her flat with his tail between his legs. He didn\u2019t even hear whatever Dan had called out to him upon his return, he just wanted to finish packing in peace. Vegas couldn\u2019t come soon enough.</p><p><b>6/23/12 \u2013 8:12 PM</b></p><p>Vegas was truly a captivating place. The lights, the sounds, the dubiously ethical activities \u2013 there was so much for them to take in, they hardly knew where to begin. The first couple days had gone well, sightseeing had proven to be a welcome distraction, and the joint liveshow had \u2013 they hoped \u2013 temporarily quelled the viewers\u2019 need for content. That left them with the rest of their trip free, though they planned to film as much as they could.</p><p>Presently, they were in one of the several restaurant-casino combos on the strip, enjoying the overindulgence that was American cuisine.</p><p>\u201cI just want to pack this up and bring it back home, eat it and relive how good this is,\u201d Dan remarked with his mouth full.</p><p>Phil nodded in agreement, but it didn\u2019t quite absolve him of his \u2018off\u2019 behavior. A few cocktails had gotten him close to a better mood, but he had been stewing in his thoughts since his breakup. He knew Dan knew as well, and his best friend\u2019s lack of attempts to talk to him about it was not helping.</p><p>\u201cSomething still bugging you?\u201d Dan had been operating under the idea that Phil would want to recover from the incident with Charlotte without him. His interference would only make things worse, he thought \u2013 which had been a contrast from his usual propensity to push himself into other people\u2019s problems to ignore his own.</p><p>After finishing his drink and signaling for another, Phil answered. \u201cI\u2019m bouncing back from getting dumped, Dan,\u201d he blinked and shook his head \u2013 the drinks had been so sweet and fruity, it was easy for him to forget how much alcohol was in there.</p><p>Dan frowned. \u201cI thought you didn\u2019t even like her that much. You wouldn\u2019t have kept cancelling dates if you really fancied her,\u201d he pointed out.</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t make it feel any better!\u201d he huffed, the outburst stunning both of them into silence, which carried through the rest of the meal.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna try my hand at the slots,\u201d Phil announced, taking what was either his fourth or fifth drink with him, while Dan meandered over to the bar.</p><p>Even without being next to each other, tension continued to build. Trying to squash their feelings with alcoholic drink after drink only did so much. The music was blaring, and the lights were bright, all their senses were in a constant state of over-stimulation, most certainly making things worse. But they only existed apart for a couple hours, stumbling to the fa\u00e7ade of the building to wait for a cab back to the hotel.</p><p>\u201cDid you win?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never fucking win.\u201d</p><p>Dan rolled his eyes and let out a dry laugh. \u201cWow, testy today, aren\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, shut up!\u201d Phil\u2019s voice took on a rare, harsh tone, one he almost never had while sober. He got out after the cab came to a stop, and they both made their way out and into the hotel. \u201cWhat the hell is your problem?\u201d he asked, trying to keep up with his brisk pace without falling, catching his breath when they made it to the elevator.</p><p>Phil glared at Dan, suddenly hating being stuck in close quarters with him \u2013 be it only for a moment, until they were let out on their floor. His blood was boiling, and he barely saw straight enough to let them into the room. \u201cYou want to know what my problem is? My problem is I can\u2019t live my fucking life because I\u2019ve built it around you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow is that my fault? I\u2019m just trying to be successful, so we can both stay afloat!\u201d Sober Dan probably would have taken responsibility for this, but drunk Dan was looking for a reason to fight. \u201cYou get hung up on every little thing that doesn\u2019t go your way, you can\u2019t expect everyone to live their lives the way you want them to!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re not even trying! I thought we were a team, you won\u2019t even consider meeting me in the middle \u2018cause you have your paranoid head shoved up your ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I have my head up my ass? At least I\u2019m trying to live my life and not dwelling on what you want us to be,\u201d Dan and Phil were in each other\u2019s faces, getting louder with each rebuttal despite the lack of necessity.</p><p>Phil stared him down and grit his teeth. \u201cWhy are you so afraid of how you feel about me?\u201d he wasn\u2019t shouting anymore, but his tone was sharp and biting.</p><p>Dan scoffed. \u201cGet over yourself, I have nothing to be afraid of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProve it.\u201d</p><p>It was a split-second decision fueled by passion and alcohol. Dan kissed Phil heatedly, hands fisting into the fabric of his shirt. They both reeked of booze and were struggling to hold each other up, leading them to stumble backwards until they fell on to Dan\u2019s bed. Their hands roamed each other\u2019s bodies, as if they were discovering each other for the first time.</p><p>Phil was the one to break the kiss, but only to strip himself and Dan of their shirts, tossing them off the bed. He quickly leaned back in, trailing his lips along Dan\u2019s jaw and down his neck, leaving one hickey after another and relishing the breathy moans that escaped. Normally he would have been chastised for marking him up so visibly, but Dan was too far gone to stop him. He was rougher with him this time, unceremoniously yanking his jeans down and letting them fall to the wayside. Phil ran his hand over Dan\u2019s crotch, feeling his cock strain against his boxer-briefs. \u201cHard already?\u201d</p><p>Dan let out a grunt, muttering \u201cShut up,\u201d only to have a sharp gasp follow as Phil gave his inner thigh a firm slap.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve had it with your fucking mouth,\u201d Phil snapped as he stripped down. He looked over and moved to rifle through the bedside drawer. \u201cOf course, you have lube, couldn\u2019t keep it in your pants for a week if you tried,\u201d he didn\u2019t give Dan the chance to offer an indignant response, pushing his hand under the waistband of his underwear and wrapping it around the base of his cock. He gave it a few slow, firm strokes, watching his face contort in arousal.</p><p>Already known for being a horny drunk, Dan could hardly think straight with Phil touching him and talking to him in that low, sexy voice that only came out right before sex. As stubborn and defiant as he\u2019d been lately, Phil reduced him to putty far more easily than he would ever admit. \u201cYou gonna use it or what?\u201d</p><p>Phil removed his hand from Dan\u2019s pants, finally discarding them with the rest of their clothes. \u201cGod, you\u2019re such a brat,\u201d he rolled him on to his stomach, squeezing his ass before spanking it. \u201cGuess I better fuck you like one, hm?\u201d when he didn\u2019t get an answer, he struck his ass again. \u201cAnswer me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Dan grunted. \u201cNeed you to fuck me,\u201d he finally gave himself over to his desires, to what he once eagerly anticipated on a near daily basis.</p><p>\u201cBecause <i>why</i>?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m being a brat.\u201d</p><p>Phil grinned triumphantly, popping the cap on the lube bottle open and slicking up two fingers. He got a firm grip on Dan\u2019s waist with his other hand, getting him up on his hands and knees before pushing his first finger past the tight ring of muscle, adding the second soon after. It wasn\u2019t long before he was pumping his fingers steadily, curving them at different angles each time. By the time he added his third finger, Dan was a desperate, writhing mess beneath him, a sight he had longed to see.</p><p>\u201cC\u2019mon Phil, please. Please, I need your cock. Want you to fuck me hard,\u201d it had been so long since Dan had begged like that, his words sending arousal straight to Phil\u2019s groin. He didn\u2019t have to wait much longer, the empty sensation promptly replaced by such a pleasured, full one that elicited loud, eager moans from him.</p><p>\u201cKnew you missed this, always such a slut for my cock,\u201d Phil couldn\u2019t cover the smugness in his tone. Hearing and feeling Dan want him felt nearly as good as the sex itself. His grip on Dan\u2019s hips tightened, pulling their bodies to slam together with each thrust until he let one hand move forward to work his length in tandem with his thrusts.</p><p>And truth be told, Dan did miss this. Not just the sex, that was just at the forefront of his clouded brain. Being underneath Phil, his body yielding to his movements, brought a warmth and familiarity into the hotel bed. And feeling Phil\u2019s hand around him brought a warmth into the pit of his stomach that grew into a hot wave of lust that overtook him. He moaned out, hitting his orgasm without warning.</p><p>But Phil wasn\u2019t done yet, keeping his firm hold on Dan as he fucked him through his orgasm, then through his own that followed shortly after. He didn\u2019t pull out until he was completely spent, letting himself fall backwards on to the bed as he caught his breath.</p><p>Dan scrambled under the covers, completely spent with his head swirling from the high of alcohol and sex. He almost felt like he should say something, but when he turned to see a completely knocked out Phil beside him, he let out a sigh of relief and dozed off as well.</p><p><b>6/30/12 \u2013 7:00 PM</b></p><p>Dan and Phil were relieved that VidCon was finally over. Don\u2019t get them wrong - they loved being able to meet and interact with their fans, but the past week had taken an emotional and physical toll on them \u2013 they were absolutely spent. Of course, this was all exacerbated by the fact that they had actively avoided addressing the events of their drunken night.</p><p>It hadn\u2019t been easy, though. Dan\u2019s neck had been littered with deep, purple marks that took over a full day of healing before he could convincingly cover them up. That cost them a day of filming, and the rest of their footage wasn\u2019t of the quality they normally strived for. Dan had no desire to upload any of it, but he had made a promise to deliver, and he wanted to follow through. He couldn\u2019t even fault Phil for it, especially since getting mad at him over it would require rehashing that night.</p><p>But now they were just left with each other in their hotel room. Their bags were packed in preparation for an early morning flight, leaving them to sit in silence and do next to nothing. Phil was the one to finally approach the subject, saying \u201cWe should talk about what happened that night,\u201d he didn\u2019t have to specify which night, Dan\u2019s tensed up reaction made it clear he knew exactly what he was referring to.</p><p>\u201cDo we, though? Like, do we actually?\u201d even he knew the answer was yes, but he was more than willing to put it off for as long as he possibly could.</p><p>\u201cYes, actually,\u201d Phil rolled his eyes. \u201cWe had sex, Dan. We had sex a week before the biggest YouTube event of the year. And I think it\u2019s because we\u2019ve been building up to it, it was inevitable.\u201d</p><p>Dan let out an exasperated sigh. \u201cBut what does it matter? We got drunk and hooked up, we had good sex when we were together, so we wanted some more without our inhibitions,\u201d he wasn\u2019t sure what he was trying to defend himself from, but he felt on edge, put on the spot. At the same time, he felt weak, like admitting that he wanted what had happened meant he couldn\u2019t keep to his resolve of maintaining a platonic relationship with Phil.</p><p>\u201cIt matters because we still have feelings for each other, and it\u2019s not fair to keep denying it,\u201d it was difficult for Phil to not take Dan\u2019s distancing from him as a personal rejection, no matter how many times they told themselves it was for the best.</p><p>\u201cSo, maybe we do,\u201d he sighed, catching Phil off guard. \u201cMaybe we never stopped having feelings for each other and you wasted a barista\u2019s time for months. But what are we supposed to do? Let ourselves be branded as \u2018Dan and Phil, YouTube couple\u2019? The fans may be progressive but the people we\u2019re looking to sponsor and employ us don\u2019t want that. They want the two guys with the emo hair that pal around in front of a camera.\u201d</p><p>Phil nodded as he listened. He had to admit, this was the most rational Dan\u2019s argument had sounded since he first started making it. If they wanted to make it in the mainstream media, it might not be such a bad idea to play it safe with how they presented themselves and presenting themselves as an openly queer couple was a risk that they couldn\u2019t afford to take. \u201cFine, maybe we can\u2019t let anyone know. But can we stop pretending behind closed doors? Can we stop trying to distract ourselves with hookups and dates and just be with each other?\u201d</p><p>Dan was quiet, pressing his lips into a fine line.

Though, if nothing else, it gave him an excuse to cocoon into his hoodie as he walked through Manchester. Catching his reflection in a shop window, he noticed the bright green of the fabric and swore under his breath, wishing York University had gone with more subtle colors. He briefly considered slipping back into the flat to change, but he was already ten minutes from home and decided it wasn&rsquo;t worth the extra trip. For someone that had built a brand on never going outside, he had found himself taking solace in these walks through the city he called home, music blaring in his ears and allowing him to check out of reality.</p><p>Did his walks happen to coincide with Charlotte&rsquo;s visits to their home? Maybe, but that was hardly worth addressing. If anything, Phil should be grateful he was being such a good friend and giving him space in such times. He&rsquo;s been keeping to himself and staying out of the way, anyone should be so lucky to have such a scarcely-present housemate.</p><p>Then why the <i>fuck</i> was he calling him right now?</p><p>Dan rolled his eyes, pulling his phone out from his pocket. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo; it had better be something urgent, he thought. It was hard to clear his head when the source of the clutter kept reestablishing its presence.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, uh, we&rsquo;re ordering Indian takeaway. Do you want anything?&rdquo;</p><p>Oh, Phil had to be kidding him, Dan thought. He pinched the bridge of his nose and let out a breath. &ldquo;Sure, just&hellip;just get my usual, okay? Thanks,&rdquo; he answered, hanging up after exchanging goodbyes. He stared up at the sky for a moment, then turned on his heel to trek back to the flat. No point in letting his food just sit there.</p><p>But when Dan was sitting and eating dinner with Phil and Charlotte, he found himself wishing he had declined Phil&rsquo;s offer. It wasn&rsquo;t that they were being affectionate or handsy, it was that it felt awkward. There was a thick tension in the room that no amount of casual conversation or bad jokes could get rid of.</p><p>&ldquo;You guys are headed to the states soon? Should be fun,&rdquo; Charlotte broke another bout of silence as she picked at her meal.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, first Vegas then Los Angeles, we&rsquo;re looking forward to it,&rdquo; Phil confirmed. &ldquo;Gonna be a wild time celebrating Dan&rsquo;s birthday in Sin City,&rdquo; he added with a grin.</p><p>Dan&rsquo;s brow quirked &ndash; that wasn&rsquo;t the sort of thing you announce in front of your girlfriend, even if you weren&rsquo;t especially exclusive. &ldquo;I mean, we&rsquo;ve never been to Vegas before. It&rsquo;ll be cool to take in the sights and all that,&rdquo; although he was talking to Charlotte, his gaze was on Phil, an incredulous expression &ndash; because what exactly was he trying to imply to her?</p><p>Phil may put on a na&iuml;ve, innocent personality in front of the camera &ndash; keep everything PG, act oblivious to innuendos, but that was his AmazingPhil persona. Phil Lester is a twenty-five-year-old adult man, who makes dirty jokes, drinks alcohol, and has sex. Dan was certain he knew how he came across, he just didn&rsquo;t quite understand <i>why</i>.</p><p><b>6/20/12 &ndash; 2:18 PM</b></p><p>Visiting Charlotte&rsquo;s flat often felt like visiting a relative &ndash; Phil was never quite sure how comfortable he should allow himself to get, no matter how warm and inviting it was. He wouldn&rsquo;t take his shoes off until instructed to, he didn&rsquo;t touch much of anything, he even used the guest towels when in the bathroom. No matter how often he frequented her home &ndash; admittedly less often than the other way around &ndash; he didn&rsquo;t feel at ease.</p><p>He supposed that made the &lsquo;we need to talk&rsquo; text that landed him here inevitable.</p><p>Sitting and waiting for the conversation to transpire made Phil feel like a child waiting to be scolded. It didn&rsquo;t take a master of perception to know where this was headed, and all he could do was brace himself for it. He chewed on his lip and fidgeted with his fingers, looking at the floor until Charlotte sat down beside him.</p><p>&ldquo;Does Dan know that you&rsquo;re in love with him?&rdquo;</p><p>Phil sat upright and blinked. He knew Charlotte to be blunt, but that was far from the breakup line that he was anticipating. He wanted to be indignant &ndash; how <i>dare</i> she make such an accusation? His voice, however, completely escaped him when he opened his mouth to speak, his mouth ran dry and his tongue was taking up too much room.</p><p>&ldquo;Do <i>you</i> know that you&rsquo;re in love with him?&rdquo;</p><p>His heart was pounding, and his stomach was knotting up. Sweat was beading up on his forehead and his cheeks flushed pink. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s more complicated than that,&rdquo; he finally told her. And it was truly the best answer he could muster. He spent so long eradicating the word &lsquo;love&rsquo; from his vocabulary, hearing it now felt foreign. It was too strong, too concrete. &ldquo;Our whole relationship is more complicated than that.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Look, I get complicated. Life is complicated,&rdquo; Charlotte&rsquo;s tone was calm, far from the anger he had been preparing for. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m not here to play the role of a distraction while you sort yourself out. I deserve someone that can give me one hundred percent of their heart, not one little room in the back of it,&rdquo; she paused for a moment. &ldquo;And you deserve to be happy, too. You&rsquo;re undoubtedly the nicest, most caring guy I&rsquo;ve ever dated. But god, you stopped in the middle of sex to answer a phone call from him. It&rsquo;s pretty clear where your priorities are.&rdquo;</p><p>She wasn&rsquo;t wrong, they both knew that. Phil felt guilty, there was no good excuse for stringing her along like that. He sighed, letting his eyes drift downward. &ldquo;So, you&rsquo;re saying&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That I&rsquo;m breaking up with you, yes.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil nodded and got up, deciding there was nothing else to say. He wasn&rsquo;t mad at her, but he was frustrated, perhaps more with himself than anyone else. &ldquo;I better go,&rdquo; he mumbled, leaving her flat with his tail between his legs. He didn&rsquo;t even hear whatever Dan had called out to him upon his return, he just wanted to finish packing in peace. Vegas couldn&rsquo;t come soon enough.</p><p><b>6/23/12 &ndash; 8:12 PM</b></p><p>Vegas was truly a captivating place. The lights, the sounds, the dubiously ethical activities &ndash; there was so much for them to take in, they hardly knew where to begin. The first couple days had gone well, sightseeing had proven to be a welcome distraction, and the joint liveshow had &ndash; they hoped &ndash; temporarily quelled the viewers&rsquo; need for content. That left them with the rest of their trip free, though they planned to film as much as they could.</p><p>Presently, they were in one of the several restaurant-casino combos on the strip, enjoying the overindulgence that was American cuisine.</p><p>&ldquo;I just want to pack this up and bring it back home, eat it and relive how good this is,&rdquo; Dan remarked with his mouth full.</p><p>Phil nodded in agreement, but it didn&rsquo;t quite absolve him of his &lsquo;off&rsquo; behavior. A few cocktails had gotten him close to a better mood, but he had been stewing in his thoughts since his breakup. He knew Dan knew as well, and his best friend&rsquo;s lack of attempts to talk to him about it was not helping.</p><p>&ldquo;Something still bugging you?&rdquo; Dan had been operating under the idea that Phil would want to recover from the incident with Charlotte without him. His interference would only make things worse, he thought &ndash; which had been a contrast from his usual propensity to push himself into other people&rsquo;s problems to ignore his own.</p><p>After finishing his drink and signaling for another, Phil answered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m bouncing back from getting dumped, Dan,&rdquo; he blinked and shook his head &ndash; the drinks had been so sweet and fruity, it was easy for him to forget how much alcohol was in there.</p><p>Dan frowned. &ldquo;I thought you didn&rsquo;t even like her that much. You wouldn&rsquo;t have kept cancelling dates if you really fancied her,&rdquo; he pointed out.</p><p>&ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t make it feel any better!&rdquo; he huffed, the outburst stunning both of them into silence, which carried through the rest of the meal.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m gonna try my hand at the slots,&rdquo; Phil announced, taking what was either his fourth or fifth drink with him, while Dan meandered over to the bar.</p><p>Even without being next to each other, tension continued to build. Trying to squash their feelings with alcoholic drink after drink only did so much. The music was blaring, and the lights were bright, all their senses were in a constant state of over-stimulation, most certainly making things worse. But they only existed apart for a couple hours, stumbling to the fa&ccedil;ade of the building to wait for a cab back to the hotel.</p><p>&ldquo;Did you win?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I never fucking win.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan rolled his eyes and let out a dry laugh. &ldquo;Wow, testy today, aren&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, shut up!&rdquo; Phil&rsquo;s voice took on a rare, harsh tone, one he almost never had while sober. He got out after the cab came to a stop, and they both made their way out and into the hotel. &ldquo;What the hell is your problem?&rdquo; he asked, trying to keep up with his brisk pace without falling, catching his breath when they made it to the elevator.</p><p>Phil glared at Dan, suddenly hating being stuck in close quarters with him &ndash; be it only for a moment, until they were let out on their floor. His blood was boiling, and he barely saw straight enough to let them into the room. &ldquo;You want to know what my problem is? My problem is I can&rsquo;t live my fucking life because I&rsquo;ve built it around you!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How is that my fault? I&rsquo;m just trying to be successful, so we can both stay afloat!&rdquo; Sober Dan probably would have taken responsibility for this, but drunk Dan was looking for a reason to fight. &ldquo;You get hung up on every little thing that doesn&rsquo;t go your way, you can&rsquo;t expect everyone to live their lives the way you want them to!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;re not even trying! I thought we were a team, you won&rsquo;t even consider meeting me in the middle &lsquo;cause you have your paranoid head shoved up your ass.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, I have my head up my ass? At least I&rsquo;m trying to live my life and not dwelling on what you want us to be,&rdquo; Dan and Phil were in each other&rsquo;s faces, getting louder with each rebuttal despite the lack of necessity.</p><p>Phil stared him down and grit his teeth. &ldquo;Why are you so afraid of how you feel about me?&rdquo; he wasn&rsquo;t shouting anymore, but his tone was sharp and biting.</p><p>Dan scoffed. &ldquo;Get over yourself, I have nothing to be afraid of.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Prove it.&rdquo;</p><p>It was a split-second decision fueled by passion and alcohol. Dan kissed Phil heatedly, hands fisting into the fabric of his shirt. They both reeked of booze and were struggling to hold each other up, leading them to stumble backwards until they fell on to Dan&rsquo;s bed. Their hands roamed each other&rsquo;s bodies, as if they were discovering each other for the first time.</p><p>Phil was the one to break the kiss, but only to strip himself and Dan of their shirts, tossing them off the bed. He quickly leaned back in, trailing his lips along Dan&rsquo;s jaw and down his neck, leaving one hickey after another and relishing the breathy moans that escaped. Normally he would have been chastised for marking him up so visibly, but Dan was too far gone to stop him. He was rougher with him this time, unceremoniously yanking his jeans down and letting them fall to the wayside. Phil ran his hand over Dan&rsquo;s crotch, feeling his cock strain against his boxer-briefs. &ldquo;Hard already?&rdquo;</p><p>Dan let out a grunt, muttering &ldquo;Shut up,&rdquo; only to have a sharp gasp follow as Phil gave his inner thigh a firm slap.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had it with your fucking mouth,&rdquo; Phil snapped as he stripped down. He looked over and moved to rifle through the bedside drawer. &ldquo;Of course, you have lube, couldn&rsquo;t keep it in your pants for a week if you tried,&rdquo; he didn&rsquo;t give Dan the chance to offer an indignant response, pushing his hand under the waistband of his underwear and wrapping it around the base of his cock. He gave it a few slow, firm strokes, watching his face contort in arousal.</p><p>Already known for being a horny drunk, Dan could hardly think straight with Phil touching him and talking to him in that low, sexy voice that only came out right before sex. As stubborn and defiant as he&rsquo;d been lately, Phil reduced him to putty far more easily than he would ever admit. &ldquo;You gonna use it or what?&rdquo;</p><p>Phil removed his hand from Dan&rsquo;s pants, finally discarding them with the rest of their clothes. &ldquo;God, you&rsquo;re such a brat,&rdquo; he rolled him on to his stomach, squeezing his ass before spanking it. &ldquo;Guess I better fuck you like one, hm?&rdquo; when he didn&rsquo;t get an answer, he struck his ass again. &ldquo;Answer me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Dan grunted. &ldquo;Need you to fuck me,&rdquo; he finally gave himself over to his desires, to what he once eagerly anticipated on a near daily basis.</p><p>&ldquo;Because <i>why</i>?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Because I&rsquo;m being a brat.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil grinned triumphantly, popping the cap on the lube bottle open and slicking up two fingers. He got a firm grip on Dan&rsquo;s waist with his other hand, getting him up on his hands and knees before pushing his first finger past the tight ring of muscle, adding the second soon after. It wasn&rsquo;t long before he was pumping his fingers steadily, curving them at different angles each time. By the time he added his third finger, Dan was a desperate, writhing mess beneath him, a sight he had longed to see.</p><p>&ldquo;C&rsquo;mon Phil, please. Please, I need your cock. Want you to fuck me hard,&rdquo; it had been so long since Dan had begged like that, his words sending arousal straight to Phil&rsquo;s groin. He didn&rsquo;t have to wait much longer, the empty sensation promptly replaced by such a pleasured, full one that elicited loud, eager moans from him.</p><p>&ldquo;Knew you missed this, always such a slut for my cock,&rdquo; Phil couldn&rsquo;t cover the smugness in his tone. Hearing and feeling Dan want him felt nearly as good as the sex itself. His grip on Dan&rsquo;s hips tightened, pulling their bodies to slam together with each thrust until he let one hand move forward to work his length in tandem with his thrusts.</p><p>And truth be told, Dan did miss this. Not just the sex, that was just at the forefront of his clouded brain. Being underneath Phil, his body yielding to his movements, brought a warmth and familiarity into the hotel bed. And feeling Phil&rsquo;s hand around him brought a warmth into the pit of his stomach that grew into a hot wave of lust that overtook him. He moaned out, hitting his orgasm without warning.</p><p>But Phil wasn&rsquo;t done yet, keeping his firm hold on Dan as he fucked him through his orgasm, then through his own that followed shortly after. He didn&rsquo;t pull out until he was completely spent, letting himself fall backwards on to the bed as he caught his breath.</p><p>Dan scrambled under the covers, completely spent with his head swirling from the high of alcohol and sex. He almost felt like he should say something, but when he turned to see a completely knocked out Phil beside him, he let out a sigh of relief and dozed off as well.</p><p><b>6/30/12 &ndash; 7:00 PM</b></p><p>Dan and Phil were relieved that VidCon was finally over. Don&rsquo;t get them wrong - they loved being able to meet and interact with their fans, but the past week had taken an emotional and physical toll on them &ndash; they were absolutely spent. Of course, this was all exacerbated by the fact that they had actively avoided addressing the events of their drunken night.</p><p>It hadn&rsquo;t been easy, though. Dan&rsquo;s neck had been littered with deep, purple marks that took over a full day of healing before he could convincingly cover them up. That cost them a day of filming, and the rest of their footage wasn&rsquo;t of the quality they normally strived for. Dan had no desire to upload any of it, but he had made a promise to deliver, and he wanted to follow through. He couldn&rsquo;t even fault Phil for it, especially since getting mad at him over it would require rehashing that night.</p><p>But now they were just left with each other in their hotel room. Their bags were packed in preparation for an early morning flight, leaving them to sit in silence and do next to nothing. Phil was the one to finally approach the subject, saying &ldquo;We should talk about what happened that night,&rdquo; he didn&rsquo;t have to specify which night, Dan&rsquo;s tensed up reaction made it clear he knew exactly what he was referring to.</p><p>&ldquo;Do we, though? Like, do we actually?&rdquo; even he knew the answer was yes, but he was more than willing to put it off for as long as he possibly could.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, actually,&rdquo; Phil rolled his eyes. &ldquo;We had sex, Dan. We had sex a week before the biggest YouTube event of the year. And I think it&rsquo;s because we&rsquo;ve been building up to it, it was inevitable.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan let out an exasperated sigh. &ldquo;But what does it matter? We got drunk and hooked up, we had good sex when we were together, so we wanted some more without our inhibitions,&rdquo; he wasn&rsquo;t sure what he was trying to defend himself from, but he felt on edge, put on the spot. At the same time, he felt weak, like admitting that he wanted what had happened meant he couldn&rsquo;t keep to his resolve of maintaining a platonic relationship with Phil.</p><p>&ldquo;It matters because we still have feelings for each other, and it&rsquo;s not fair to keep denying it,&rdquo; it was difficult for Phil to not take Dan&rsquo;s distancing from him as a personal rejection, no matter how many times they told themselves it was for the best.</p><p>&ldquo;So, maybe we do,&rdquo; he sighed, catching Phil off guard. &ldquo;Maybe we never stopped having feelings for each other and you wasted a barista&rsquo;s time for months. But what are we supposed to do? Let ourselves be branded as &lsquo;Dan and Phil, YouTube couple&rsquo;? The fans may be progressive but the people we&rsquo;re looking to sponsor and employ us don&rsquo;t want that. They want the two guys with the emo hair that pal around in front of a camera.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil nodded as he listened. He had to admit, this was the most rational Dan&rsquo;s argument had sounded since he first started making it. If they wanted to make it in the mainstream media, it might not be such a bad idea to play it safe with how they presented themselves and presenting themselves as an openly queer couple was a risk that they couldn&rsquo;t afford to take. &ldquo;Fine, maybe we can&rsquo;t let anyone know. But can we stop pretending behind closed doors? Can we stop trying to distract ourselves with hookups and dates and just be with each other?&rdquo;</p><p>Dan was quiet, pressing his lips into a fine line. He swallowed thickly, turning to look out the window. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>",
