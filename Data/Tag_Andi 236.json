        "question": "Luke says we can expect \u201ca lot of craziness happening with TJ, especially in his mind and with other people.\u201d The latter half of that sounds Tyrus related, but any ideas on what the \u201cmind\u201d part might be about? The dyscalculia plotline? Sexuality (on second thought, probably not)? Something else entirely?",
        "answer": "<p>It won\u2019t be related to his sexuality, that\u2019s simply not in the show\u2019s dna. However, it may provide the angst that the gay story line won\u2019t be allowed to. It\u2019s very hard to tell because this is almost certainly not something the writers planned for in S2 so there likely aren\u2019t many if any hints. It\u2019s very unusual for one recurring character to get so much development and they\u2019ve already given him a learning disability. Anything too severe starts tipping TJ into a sort of\u00a0\u2018tragic gay\u2019 trope. We can guess from when Josh first brought it up that it happens or at least starts in 3a and if both Josh and Luke can hint at it it\u2019s likely not meant to be some huge shocking twist.</p><p>There\u2019s a pretty broad spectrum of mental health story lines the show has done from Amber just needing someone to talk to and confide in to Jonah having multiple panic attacks. It\u2019s hard to imagine Disney approving a big mental health story line for TJ especially since he\u2019s a gay recurring character tied to Cyrus who\u2019s plot lines in general are either non-existent or get short thrift. That Andi has yet to learn about Jonah\u2019s panic attacks and Jonah has yet to get real treatment for them suggests that the show is going to circle back to that story line in a big way which also suggests that TJ\u2019s plot line would be less intensive.</p><p>It could be something like TJ learning how to cope with stress or express emotions better; kind of unpacking the effects toxic masculinity can have. I could see the show at some point focusing on body image issues, they affect a lot of kids and it would be a bold choice to focus on body image issues that boys can have but as this is a show targeted to young girls I could see the writers deciding that giving a body image issues story line to one of the female characters could have more of an impact. Maybe TJ has a phobia? Something like a fear of dogs/heights/thunder and Cyrus can help him overcome it.\u00a0</p><p>For more serious mental health issues it could be something like depression but I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s too far for Disney and realistically if any character on this show is depressed it would be Cyrus, who\u2019s also the one character whose mental health issues are largely treated as a joke. ADHD might be something Disney would allow but it doesn\u2019t seem to fit with what we\u2019ve seen of TJ, he seems to be able to focus just fine at work and on the team. OCD would be interesting but again we don\u2019t know Disney\u2019s restrictions. Anger management issues run the risk of making the audience afraid for both Cyrus and the kids who TJ works with and doesn\u2019t seem to fit with his past approach to setbacks which is to generally be sulky and run away from his problems.\u00a0</p><p>I\u2019ve mentioned before that part of the reason this will be the last season is that the gay story line is going to reach the hard limits of what Disney will allow but I also think that will hold true for other story lines as well. The Quinn/Mack family story line is likely going to delve perilously close into the circumstances of Andi\u2019s birth and early life. And it\u2019s likely that Jonah\u2019s mental health story line and TJ\u2019s mental health story line as well as whatever other mental health story lines they do will also reach the limits of what Disney is willing to approve.\u00a0</p>",
