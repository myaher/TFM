I dont care whether I like it or not because I mind my own damn business and leave you alone.\nI'm open minded to multiple ships in one fandom because why the fuck not? That doesn't mean I don't have an OTP I'm just chill.\nXemnas/Sora shipper since KH2 came out.\nI write.\nI make videos sometimes.\nI post my friend's art for her since she doesn't have a tumblr.\nI reblog whatever is my fancy. I also get random mood changes and spam random things straight. Oops. \nI will most likely post something REALLY clever every so often.",
