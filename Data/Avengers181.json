He mourned as larks do, hidden in sight. </p><p>Steve leaned against crumbling stairwells, weathered hands cradling mourning mind that creased no more. Flexing fingers around empty smoke, blue rims of unseeing eyes, piled static in his ears. Pinpricks seared numbness of the back, motion captured of frost over stuttering heart. He mourned as ants do, unasked outside purpose. </p><p>Thor bowed over buckled knees, mourning in greying hair between unkempt beard. Roared out pain, shaking limbs holding death, clawing fingers over proud chestplate. Ghosts scarred over his arms, ash gaining sweat over cheeks as echoes left loose lips. He mourned as clouds do, heavy despite light. </p><p>Bruce pressed bloody palms to thundering ears, sickly green rising up his chest. Ripped skin stitching as they tear, fists buried in falling hair, shivers rattling in oxygen rejected. Bullet shells ring under feet, emptiness drags the neck low in a noose of imagined innards. He mourned as seeds do, buried till thrown out with dirt. </p><p>Natasha wrapped arms around her gut, peeled open eyes mourning blinking red. Trembling lips pierced by earned wolves&rsquo; teeth, dragging air around choked larynx, bile fresh behind tongue. Cracked bones shatter under weight, legs dragging towards the next death with remaining life. She mourned as graves do, filled yet hollow. </p><p>Clint wrestled against pulsing heartbeats, mourning in all dimensions for silent viewing. Sobs erupted as scoffed laughter, purpling bags under eyes narrowed, unsanctioned jerks of toes against binding leather. Wrapped cuts scratch open on strings, simmering edges of targets blurring on target boards. He mourned as flags do, manipulated in independence. </p><p>Mourning was an unprecedented wail that was bitten off, swallowed in war cries. It was a vow of denial. It was the end of victory. It was the beginning of avenging. </p>",

Flexing fingers around empty smoke, blue rims of unseeing eyes, piled static in his ears. Pinpricks seared numbness of the back, motion captured of frost over stuttering heart. He mourned as ants do, unasked outside purpose. </p><p>Thor bowed over buckled knees, mourning in greying hair between unkempt beard. Roared out pain, shaking limbs holding death, clawing fingers over proud chestplate. Ghosts scarred over his arms, ash gaining sweat over cheeks as echoes left loose lips. He mourned as clouds do, heavy despite light. </p><p>Bruce pressed bloody palms to thundering ears, sickly green rising up his chest. Ripped skin stitching as they tear, fists buried in falling hair, shivers rattling in oxygen rejected. Bullet shells ring under feet, emptiness drags the neck low in a noose of imagined innards. He mourned as seeds do, buried till thrown out with dirt. </p><p>Natasha wrapped arms around her gut, peeled open eyes mourning blinking red. Trembling lips pierced by earned wolves\u2019 teeth, dragging air around choked larynx, bile fresh behind tongue. Cracked bones shatter under weight, legs dragging towards the next death with remaining life. She mourned as graves do, filled yet hollow. </p><p>Clint wrestled against pulsing heartbeats, mourning in all dimensions for silent viewing. Sobs erupted as scoffed laughter, purpling bags under eyes narrowed, unsanctioned jerks of toes against binding leather. Wrapped cuts scratch open on strings, simmering edges of targets blurring on target boards. He mourned as flags do, manipulated in independence. </p><p>Mourning was an unprecedented wail that was bitten off, swallowed in war cries. It was a vow of denial. It was the end of victory. It was the beginning of avenging. </p>",

Eyes closed and legs crossed, she concentrated on the luminescent Power Stone that warmed her curled fingertips despite the cavern\u2019s icy chill that drafted through the hollow chamber like passing spirits in the night.</p><p>\u00a0 The sound of metal scraping against metal brought her astral body back to her physical form as the Power Stone settled against her chest. She felt confident in her delivery to Tony. He would make the right choice to kill her if it came down to it. He knew more than anyone what it meant to make the hard decisions when nobody else could. It was a promise.</p><p>\u00a0 Scrambling for normalcy as the heavy doors slid upwards, (Y/N) leaned back in her chair, arms folded across her chest as she traced a casual smirk across her lips to welcome back the Mad Titan. It had only been a few hours of his absence but had she really forgotten how intimidating he was? Even his taut muscles that seemed to be carved from stone by Ares as a monument to war, paled in comparison to the iron in his eyes. Their overpowering nature made it painfully easy for her to see how he had stricken fear into the hearts of so many for so long without anyone raising a fist in objection.</p><p>\u00a0 And at that moment, despite not showing it, she wished that she were an exception.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cBack so soon?\u201d (Y/N) crooned at him poisonously.\u00a0\u201cAnd to think, I was just getting used to <i>not</i> thinking about killing innocent people. What a crazy idea, huh? You should try it sometime. Really soothes the soul.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cCease your patronizing,\u201d Thanos ordered lowly as he towered before her. \u201cIt\u2019s growing tiresome. Even from you.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cThen send me back Earth and you won\u2019t have to hear it anymore,\u201d (Y/N) postulated with the cock of her head and a poised smile.</p><p>\u00a0 Thanos grinned back at her viscously, making her own simper falter.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cThere are more ways than one to make you cooperate, child,\u201d Thanos threatened as he raised his gauntlet that was exuding the familiar blue light that made (Y/N)\u2019s stomach churn in anticipation.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cSo, you\u2019re really about to do this?\u201d (Y/N) stalled, jolting upright from her chair.\u00a0\u201cWithout taking even a moment to question this, this <i>genocide</i> that you\u2019re about to commit. Question your moralities? Your judgment? You can still change your mind. Still, make the right decision here.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ve had centuries to mull over the possibilities in my head,\u201d Thanos responded. \u201cI no longer have doubts to stop me from what I must do.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cAnd that\u2019s why you killed your daughter, right? Because you thought <i>so</i> hard on it?\u201d (Y/N) pinned him as his body tensed at her words. She sneered disgustedly at him. \u201cProbably\u00a0should\u2019ve taken more time on that one.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 Thanos grimaced towards the wall beside him as he cracked his meat slab of a neck, it\u2019s sound vibrating against the titanium in a sickening crunch. Returning his attention to the defiant warrior before him, he watched the unwieldy winter storm that brewed violently behind her eyes, reminding him of how lethal she would be if only she realized her true power. But she wouldn\u2019t. Not in time, anyway.</p><p>\u00a0 His grimace became more relaxed at his realization as he raised his fist once again.\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t know which will kill you first. Your shallow pride, your recklessness&hellip;or me.\u201d And with those words, the Space Stone recaptured (Y/N)\u2019s mind, it\u2019s tendrils becoming entangled with every fiber of her being, wrapping itself like a parasite around her veins.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 Thanos had to respect her, though. Despite the pain he knew that the mind control caused her (more greatly than most since the Space Stone was also lending itself to her own abilities, combining with the Orb\u2019s power), the girl never flinched. Her razor-sharp gaze never left his own until they were veiled by a curtain of sapphire blue, finally lowering with her knee to the floor in prostration.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"400\" data-orig-height=\"225\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"dimensao7:y69j3WcY_8MMUoX5mkPEQg:ZywZ8w2Eefm6p\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/724aa03150858724f9633bfdf53d417c/tumblr_ogm1pc3LjU1rnbafjo1_400.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"400\" data-orig-height=\"225\"/></figure><p>\u00a0 The slight pain that shot through his own chest surprised him as he wished that her cooperation was that of her own instead of through force, wishing once again for the apprentice-like relationship that he had had with Gamora.</p><p>\u00a0 He shook away his apprehension with ease as he commanded her to stand, observing the ethereal grace of his weapon with a faint satisfaction.</p><hr><p><b>T I T A N</b></p><p>\u00a0 Strange swallowed his trepidation, wearing a mask of neutrality as he watched the growing portal of shadows part way to Thanos, the psychopath of the century. His figure was jarring to the sorcerer despite the visions he had seen, the reality of Thanos\u2019s overwhelming presence\u00a0making him shuffle slightly in his seat atop the stone staircase above the Mad Titan.</p><p>\u00a0 As the portal dissipated, Thanos\u2019s eyes surveyed the apocalyptic landscape of his once flourishing home planet. The taunting breeze shifted the dirt to make the city appear to still be smoking as if the planet had just collapsed that very morning under flames and tragedy. It laughed at him wickedly. Thanos winced in memory.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cOh, yeah. You\u2019re much more of a Thanos,\u201d Strange remarked boldly, grasping Thanos\u2019s attention from his harrowing reverie. It was at that point when Thanos began to stalk towards the sorcerer that Strange understood the depths of his own trepidation, taking in Thanos\u2019s calculated steps with observant eyes.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201c(Y/N) has already informed me of the Maw\u2019s death,\u201d Thanos mused to Strange, which twitched the corners of Strange\u2019s lips into a smirk, remembering the\u00a0well-deserved beheading on the Maw\u2019s own ship. \u201cThis day extracts a heavy toll. Still, he accomplished his mission.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYou may regret that,\u201d Strange returned with a flick of his marred eyebrow. \u201cHe brought you face-to-face with the Master of the Mystic Arts.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cAnd where do you think he brought you?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cLet me guess. Your home?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 Thanos laughed humorlessly, placing a foot atop a fallen piece of debris as he launched into Titan\u2019s tragic backstory (complete with a Reality-Stone-induced projection of the planet at it\u2019s best, how generous!).</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m a survivor,\u201d Thanos announced, almost proudly.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWho wants to murder trillions,\u201d Strange retorted.</p><p>\u00a0 \u201cWith all six stones, I could simply snap my fingers and they would all cease to exist,\u201d Thanos said.\u00a0\u201cI call that&hellip;mercy.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cAnd then what?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI\u2019d finally rest and watch the sun rise on a grateful Universe,\u201d Thanos answered with a relieved sigh. He turned towards the\u00a0smog-filled skies that bared its weight upon the planet like a falling building. The atmosphere itself was claustrophobic. It made him yearn for the days of fresh air and blue skies from his youth, but he pulled himself from his desires, focusing once again on the sorcerer before him. \u201c&hellip;that is, with my greatest accomplice.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 Thanos grinned as he clenched his fist to open another shadow-filled portal. Blue and grey curls of smoke poured from the Stygian dimension to allow for an even darker silhouette to approach, a figure concealed by a pitch-black hooded cloak lined in silver detailing as wickedly sharp as the ice-wielded blades at the figure\u2019s sides. Stepping from the portal, the figure lifted her hood to reveal a masked face, only her eyes and {your colored} hair visible. The wild, flyaway baby hairs were easily recognizable, but the emotionless blue tint of her eyes made Strange suck in a breath.</p><p>\u00a0 From his place above the scene on the edge of a decrepit building, Peter had to shove his hand over his mouth to keep from shouting at her. Tony had warned him that (Y/N) would be there and that she might look different, but using his suit to take a closer inspection of her eyes, he could barely recognize her. No hint of the sly, teasing smile that she almost always wore, or the strong, young, foster home girl that his aunt had taken in so many years ago. The one that helped him through his first crush&hellip;and the death of his uncle. It was like looking at a wax figure of one of his childhood heroes.</p><p>\u00a0 Even Tony had to stifle his own heartache when he asked Friday to hack into Peter\u2019s viewfinder to see (Y/N) for himself. This was worse than Clint. Even worse than when Wanda had possessed Bruce. Like Peter, he couldn\u2019t see a trace of his person anywhere in the face of the girl that stood beside that shriveled up monster.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 But he couldn\u2019t say that (Y/N) hadn\u2019t warned him. Even if the hallucination he saw was all in his head, a figment of his anxiety-riddled mind, he knew this day would haunt him for the rest of his life.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cSurprised, are you?\u201d Thanos boasted at Strange, letting out a deep laugh that seemed to rumble the ground beneath him.\u00a0\u201cIt took a bit of persuading, but the Space Stone finally allowed her to see my vision at it\u2019s fullest potential. I think you\u2019ll find her much more tolerable now with the discipline she has learned in our short time together.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cThis is what you call mercy?\u201d Strange choked out, managing to not stumble over his words despite what he was seeing. His close ally that he would now have to fight somehow. Of all of his visions, this was one of the ones he desperately pleaded not to come to pass. But it was the path that had to be walked.</p><p>\u00a0 Thanos crouched beside (Y/N), brushing his thumb over her cheek to disengage the black, silken mask over her face, lingering ever so slightly on her high cheekbone as he leaned towards her just to taunt Strange who balled his fists at his side with sparks of raging red.\u00a0\u201cHe desires to witness mercy, my child,\u201d Thanos mocked, taking a glance at the sorcerer.\u00a0\u201cShow him what he wishes for.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 Immediately, (Y/N) raised her hands in front of her, palms towards the sky as blue and purple magic intertwined on her fingertips like strands of DNA. Eyes still locked on the empty space in front of her, everyone was lifted into the stifling atmosphere from their cover positions. Peter, Quill, Drax, and Mantis all hovered in mid-air before the sorceress like something out of <i>Poltergeist</i>, all trying to fight her control, but her power was relentless. Even Strange tried to break them out, but his magic bounced back and almost paralyzed him as he ducked and rolled away.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s pitiful that they think they can hide from us,\u201d (Y/N) taunted with a wicked smile that was like nothing Peter had ever seen worn by her before as she turned to Thanos.\u00a0\u201cWhat would you like me to do with them?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 Thanos looked out over his conquests with arms folded over his chest, taking in a content breath.\u00a0\u201cLet them live,\u201d he ordered, then turned to (Y/N),\u00a0\u201cfor now.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 The smug look on her face grew even darker as she moved her arms in an outward sweeping motion that catapulted Mantis and Quill to the left while Drax and Peter were thrown into an archway on the right that crumbled to ash.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 Although he looked thoroughly shellshocked, Strange stood his ground, approaching the edge of the dais with his chin held high.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cSo, what is she now? Your bodyguard?\u201d Strange barked at Thanos, giving a longing look to (Y/N), but it was like staring at the bottom of the ocean. Hauntingly dark and absolutely lifeless. But he knew she was in there. Somewhere. She had to be.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cMore of a guarantee that the stones will find their way into the right hand,\u201d Thanos answered with a fond glance at (Y/N) who stood as a sentry beside him.</p><p>\u00a0 But before Strange could respond, he heard Tony\u2019s warning just prior to witnessing the large stalactite the size of a city bus that Tony was holding come hurtling straight down towards Thanos and (Y/N), preparing to crush them like ants under a boot. Quick reflexes leant to Strange\u2019s magic being shot towards (Y/N) to move her out of the way, but she was quicker. Thrusting forward her own hand, she sent his red beam barreling back at him like a bullet which he narrowly dodged as he watched a lilac-tinted forcefield appear around Thanos and (Y/N). The moment the stalactite hit the forcefield, it shattered like sand in a kid\u2019s playground around them in a shower of golden dust that beamed in the starlight.</p><p>\u00a0 With her other hand outstretched towards the sky, (Y/N) waited for the dust to settle until she spotted the red and gold suit gleaming under her amethyst spell where he thrashed to try and escape. A fly caught in her spider\u2019s web.</p><p>\u00a0 Tony witnessed the same gruesome smile split her striking features, not prepared to experience what it felt like to be her enemy, just as she twisted her wrist that sent him soaring across the abandoned planet, slamming into the cursed donut ship that brought him there in the first place.</p><p>\u00a0 With a groan, Tony shoved a large piece of metal from the old, battered ship off of his suit, barely managing to sit upright as he shook himself off.</p><p>\u00a0 \u201cHe wants to fight dirty,\u201d Tony snarled to Friday, preparing his arsenal with deadly precision. \u201cThen, let\u2019s fight dirty.\u201d</p><hr><p>\u00a0 This was the worst. The actual fucking worst. (Y/N) would have rather spent seven more years suffering through torture after torture inside the nightmare-inducing corridors of Hydra than be where she was now. Whatever subhuman horrors they would\u2019ve had lined up for her would\u2019ve been eagerly accepted by the girl who was slamming her fists against the walls of her mind. Fist after fist, she pounded and screamed and begged for her body to break free from its bondage, but she was trapped. Borderline hopeless as she was forced to watch her torture her own friends and what seemed like allies, watching as her magic easily tossed their bodies back and forth across the dusty plane, only getting knocked back a few times when they teamed up against her.</p><p>\u00a0 She hoped they would team up against her. Rooted for them to take her the fuck out. But she could see the obvious restraint they held against her, especially Peter and Tony. She could see the immediate difference between Tony dropping literal bombshells on Thanos versus him just trying to knock (Y/N) off of her feet long enough to knock her unconscious. But she swatted him aside time and time again.</p><p>\u00a0 In a battle between her and Tony, she got him pinned to the ground, ice katana hovering over his arch reactor before his thruster knocked it from her grasp. But all she had to do was manipulate another one that drilled a hole into the dirt right next to his head that he just barely managed to dodge.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYou know, you\u2019re taking this a bit far if you\u2019re still mad about Siberia,\u201d he quipped at her, widening his eyes when only a low snarl escaped her lips. Somehow, Tony blasted her off of him, but it was a weak blow.</p><p>\u00a0 <i>The only way to stop him is to stop me</i>, (Y/N) sent out to Tony, her voice echoing in the back of his mind, but he shook it away, still believing it was just his anxiety trying to sneak up on him again (which it was, but the voice was very much real). <i>Oh, and they call me the stubborn one</i>, (Y/N) groaned in annoyance which made Tony\u2019s eyebrows furrow, but again, he denied her warnings.</p><p>\u00a0 <i>For fuck\u2019s sake! What does a girl have to do to get her best friend to kill her in order to save the Universe? </i>(Y/N) thought to herself glumly, biting back the dark laughter that was rising inside of her at the nonsensical situation Thanos had put her and the entire Universe into. If she got the chance to kill him&hellip;</p><p>\u00a0 <i>WHACK.\u00a0</i></p><p>\u00a0 The crunch of bones reverberated in (Y/N)\u2019s head as her skull cracked against something hard and metallic. The pain was blinding as she crumpled to the ground, but all she could think about was how unfair it was that even when she couldn\u2019t control her body, she still had to suffer through the pain that her puppet body went through. Seriously, what the hell?</p><p>\u00a0 Her eyes focused in and out, the blue curtain fading as she blinked furiously to fight against the Space Stone, but the mind control won out over her. <i>Damn</i>. All the attack did was piss off her alter-ego that turned to face the open-mouthed ally that she guessed Tony referred to as, the \u2018Space Cowboy.\u2019 He grinned awkwardly at her as she gritted her teeth at him wickedly, the reflection of her own face in the abandoned metal ship beside her frightening (Y/N) to her core. She never knew that she could terrify herself, and yet&hellip;</p><p>\u00a0 She felt her neck twitch to the side which sent the Space Cowboy on a trip through the air as he crashed to the ground, rolling over himself until his back snapped hard against a large boulder. Watching it, she could feel her own spine react violently, her ears filling in the whip-like crack that she didn\u2019t actually hear. Could only know from experience. Standing, she stalked across the blinding sands with her eyes focused on the man who still groaned in agony on in the dirt.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 From her peripheral, she caught sight of the blue-tinted alien she recognized as Nebula. The woman charged at her with a razor-sharp, electrically-charged blade that gleamed wickedly in the rays of whatever poor star had the burden of lighting this deserted hellhole. Without taking her eyes from her initial target, (Y/N)\u2019s hand struck with cobra-like precision to her left, grasping ahold of Nebula\u2019s blade with inhuman strength. Despite the crimson blood that seeped from the palm of her hand, (Y/N) turned on Nebula with such a dark expression that even the assassin was forced to gape with fear. Nebula tried to remember the feisty girl who had desperately attempted to break her out of Thanos\u2019s torture chamber with the help of her own sister, but that girl wasn\u2019t who she was facing now. She could only see the sadistic tendencies of her own father mirrored back at her from the stranger\u2019s gemstone eyes.</p><p>\u00a0 Taking advantage of Nebula\u2019s incapacitated fear, (Y/N) tore the blade from Nebula\u2019s grasp, using the hilt to backhand across the woman\u2019s face to knock her unconscious in a single devastating motion. Nebula\u2019s limp body hit the ground with a thud at (Y/N)\u2019s feet, but the sorceress continued her march towards her target with only a distant apathy and the splatter of Nebula\u2019s blood adorning her features. The blade dropped to the ground with a sharp clatter right next to Nebula\u2019s head, but the woman\u2019s body remained still.</p><p>\u00a0 (Y/N) watched with hollow, hungry eyes as the man who had attacked her attempted to stand, grasping the edges of the rock behind him like it was his last hope. And maybe it was. However, just before she reached him, Thanos\u2019s strangled groans caught her attention. She whipped her head around to the aid of her Master as he fought against Strange in a massive battle of magic versus magic. It reminded her of the Boss stage in a video game, but more vibrant and tangible than she could\u2019ve ever imagined. She could almost taste the magic as it seared the atmosphere in violent color like laser beams across the sky.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 Forgetting the pathetic human, (Y/N)\u2019s body began to lithely snake its way towards Strange, apparently planning to take him out from behind like a dirty coward. Using her magic, she maneuvered some stone fragments to form a path for her to reach the cliffside that Strange was fighting from. She couldn\u2019t help feeling like she really was in a video game, reality slipping further and further away from her as the minutes passed by and the mind control continued to drip like poison into her bloodstream.</p><p>\u00a0 Finally in position, (Y/N) raised her hand to take him out, the beam of amethyst magic convulsing against her palm to end this pitiful battle that only served as a minor inconvenience to her Master\u2019s vision. To end the life of Stephen Strange.</p><p>\u00a0 But at the last moment, her sights were blinded by a sweeping kick to the back of her head that sent her sprawling to the ground far below. The stones she upheld crashed down around her as soon as she hit the dirt, smashing her head against a piece of rock halfway down that jutted from the cliffside.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 A swinging flash of red and blue spotted her memory as she opened her eyes again and rolled to her side, pulling her index finger away from her forehead to reveal a stream of blood. With a groan, her\u00a0hand dropped to the ground like a dead fish. Through her rapid blinking into the oddly lit sky, she realized that her sight was clear. No blue film. No mind control. She was free&hellip;for now. But probably not for long. Her eyes almost popped out of her head with shock, but she stifled herself when she saw Thanos from across the plane. He was still battling it out against Strange and Peter, slamming the teenager who had just knocked her out of Thanos\u2019s grasp into the dirt with the force of a semi-truck.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 She barely managed to reel herself in from protecting Peter and not blow her cover before Thanos released him. Taking a breath, (Y/N) used the small amount of power she had received from the Space Stone to disguise her eyes back into the blue tint as she stood, forcing her body to remain as rigid and robotic as possible to convey that she was still under his control, taking a moment to calm the Orb that was growing warmer by the minute around her neck as her anger took a dangerous turn. But she had to remain calm, unbothered, emotionless.</p><p>\u00a0 She continued her trek across the sands, praying for nobody to contest her until she reached Thanos\u2019s side. All she needed was to get close enough to him&hellip;she just needed to get there&hellip;she just needed to-</p><p>\u00a0 And there was this fucking guy. The colorful language that suddenly swarmed her head could have filled a sixty-four pack of Crayola crayons. She heard his allies call him,\u00a0\u201cDrax,\u201d which seemed&hellip;fitting, as he charged at her, yelling as he went, pecs out to play, swords dancing in the sky like parade batons.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 (Y/N) couldn\u2019t help rolling her eyes as she sent him sprawling across the sky like a guy who had just gotten a rather rude awakening after he fell asleep inside of a circus cannon (weird comparison, but it paints the perfect picture).</p><p>\u00a0 Finally, she reached Thanos\u2019s side where they combined the power of their stones to break through Strange\u2019s mirror dimension shield that flipped him backward off of his cliff point that exploded into a rainfall of dust. She knew that it wasn\u2019t a deadly blow, but it would keep him down for a minute, just long enough for her to do what needed to be done.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cMy child, you continue to impress me,\u201d Thanos complimented her with a condescending tone that made her want to rip his tongue out, but she would be patient. Even when he placed his hand on her shoulder, she remained a marble statue, the perfect soldier at perfect ease.\u00a0\u201cBut what would truly impress me would be if you retrieved me the Mind <i>and </i>Time Stone. Do not fail me as&hellip;.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 Thanos trailed off as Tony landed in front of him like a meteor striking the dirt, thrusters flaring at the madman with the intensity of a dragon\u2019s breath.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be a failure if she was doing the right thing,\u201d Tony quipped.\u00a0\u201cNot that you know what the right thing is, even if it hit you in the face. But let\u2019s test out that theory, anyhow&hellip;\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cStark,\u201d Thanos mused hauntingly, giving Tony pause.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYou know me?\u201d He demanded.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI do,\u201d Thanos grinned. \u201cI\u2019ve watched over you and (Y/N) for quite some time now. You\u2019re not the only one cursed with knowledge.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cMy only curse is you,\u201d Tony spit as he prepared to attack, but his eyes caught a flicker of silver inconspicuously slice through the air at (Y/N)\u2019s wrist like a wisp of candlelight. At the same moment, he glimpsed a shift in her face, a warning to stay back.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0Thanos only gave a curt, cold laugh at Tony\u2019s response.\u00a0\u201cNo, I wouldn\u2019t imagine you to agree with what I am here to do. That\u2019s alright. I am not here to negotiate. Tell your\u00a0friend to hand over the stone, and no one else has to get hurt. I know you would do anything to protect those you love.\u201d Thanos bolstered, stroking the length of (Y/N)\u2019s hair with deadly precision. It set Tony\u2019s teeth on edge, but he flashed another glance at her blades and instead let out a dramatic sigh.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cAgain, have to admit. He\u2019s still not my friend. Good guy, not the best with the sense of humor. Could work on loosening up the old cloak strings, if you know what I mean. Maybe you two could start a social group together-\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cEnough!\u201d Thanos bellowed, but the moment he took his first step towards Tony, both of (Y/N)\u2019s blades sunk deep into his once impenetrable flesh, one through his chest while the other found it\u2019s mark far below the belt.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cCongratulations, you finally found your balls,\u201d (Y/N) purred at the Mad Titan as he was brought to his knees, blood frothing from his mouth through his guttural roars of pain that threatened to choke him at each breath, but (Y/N) wouldn\u2019t let up. She only leaned\u00a0in harder to press her blades deeper into his body as a daring smile lit up her clear eyes, amethyst smoke curling from her nose. Thanos couldn\u2019t take his eyes off of her. The shock that she had caught him unguarded was written in bloody ink across his disturbed features.</p><p>\u00a0 Tony was in a state of shock as well. He stared in awe at the power and control (Y/N) displayed over possibly the strongest person in the galaxy. The rapid change in events left him speechless, but (Y/N) broke him out of his stupor pretty quickly when she whipped her head towards him with eyes as intense as wildfire, preparing to reduce everything that stood in her way to ash.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cThe gauntlet, moron! Get the fucking gauntlet!\u201d She commanded him breathlessly, turning back to Thanos as she struggled to hold him down. A few moments later, Drax slid across the dust like he was sliding to home plate, \u00a0grabbing ahold of Thanos\u2019s left leg, Peter behind him with a web across the blade in Thanos\u2019s chest, while Quill dropped a weapon that held down Thanos\u2019s left arm. Strange miraculously appeared over the horizon lifted by his cape to cast a portal over Thanos\u2019s head to drop Mantis onto his oversized shoulders where she tapped his temples with her fingertips to lull him into a deep, nightmarish sleep, his hollow eyes swirling with musky smoke as his tensed muscles relaxed slightly. He was still fighting, but it was as if he were trying to run a mile through the ocean. The current always pulled him back.</p><p>\u00a0 Tony launched himself at the gauntlet, seizing the golden beacon with a desperation like he\u2019d never felt before. This was their chance. This was the moment that would change everything. This was it.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cIs he under? Don\u2019t let up!\u201d Tony encouraged Mantis.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cBe quick! He is very strong!\u201d She cried out, grappling against Thanos\u2019s brutal attempts to block her out of his mind, but she was determined to not back down. She knew who she was fighting for.</p><p>\u00a0 Tony called for Peter to help him get the gauntlet, both heaving it slowly out of place. Like insanely slowly. Like the Mariana Trench dug itself an extra ten feet in the time it took them to slide the gauntlet even an inch off of Thanos\u2019s wrist.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cSo, (Y/N),\u201d Tony said, testing to see if his hallucination was real or not, \u201cstill want me to kill you?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 (Y/N) just scoffed at him through gritted teeth.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cCall this Plan B,\u201d she challenged, not taking her burning eyes off of Thanos until she peered up at Mantis.\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re not taking any of his pain away, right?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cNo! He is still in anguish!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cGood,\u201d (Y/N) whispered as she forced her blades even deeper, feeling him struggle beneath her bloody hands. Without hesitation, she allowed herself to relish the revenge. She didn\u2019t notice Quill saunter up behind her until he spoke.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cPlan B?\u201d he scoffed, thoroughly startling (Y/N). In any other situation, a blade would\u2019ve been pulled on his ass. \u201cThis is Plan A. <i>My</i>\u00a0Plan A that, for the record, totally worked,\u201d he boasted, pointing towards Strange who rolled his eyes.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cShut up, Sideburns and go sit down if you\u2019re gonna be a prick,\u201d (Y/N) snarled at him, making the man scoff again as he cleared his throat.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s Starlord,\u201d he announced boisterously in a much deeper voice, managing to puff out his chest indignantly despite (Y/N)\u2019s glare.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cBy choice?\u201d She threw back at him, making Peter almost lose his grip on the gauntlet trying not to laugh, but Tony ordered him to stay focused.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cYes, by choice-\u201d Quill began to argue, but a low moan escaped Thanos which drew his attention instead.\u00a0\u201cHa! Not so strong now, huh&hellip;where\u2019s Gamora?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 (Y/N) froze as she felt the color drain from her face. At the mention of her name, (Y/N) felt like she couldn\u2019t breathe, a cold sweat breaking out across her brow. Her chest tightened along with the grip on her blades that made her knuckles turn a deathly, skeletal white.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201c&hellip;<i>my Gamora</i>,\u201d Thanos growled out.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cNo, bullshit,\u201d Quill swore just as (Y/N) finally found her voice again.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYou know Gamora?\u201d she breathed out, just barely loud enough for Quill to hear. He turned to her with wide eyes.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYeah&hellip;\u201d Quill said slowly, narrowing his eyes at her.\u00a0\u201cYeah, she\u2019s my girlfriend&hellip;why? Did you see her? Do you know where she is?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 Oh, it hurt. It hurt so fucking bad.</p><p>\u00a0 (Y/N)\u2019s eyes flicked towards the ground, then back at Quill.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYou know where she is, don\u2019t you? Tell me! Please!\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI&hellip;I will explain everything when this is all over. Once we get the gauntlet, I will tell you-\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWhy not now? Why not&hellip;no&hellip;\u201d Quill gasped as he turned on Thanos, shaking his head numbly at the madman, refusing to believe what he was hearing.\u00a0\u201cNo&hellip;tell me you didn\u2019t! Tell me you didn\u2019t&hellip;\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 Thanos struggled to speak, either choked up by the spell that cursed him, or the images that were flashing through his mind of what he had done.</p><p>\u00a0 \u201cHe-he mourns!\u201d Mantis stammered out as (Y/N) nodded over to Strange who nodded back to her, giving her the go-ahead to release her grip on the hilts of her blades as she turned to face Quill, but Nebula spoke before (Y/N) got the chance. The woman\u2019s figure began to wilt as she spoke.</p><p>\u00a0 \u201cGamora&hellip;he took her to Vormir,\u201d Nebula stated coldly, her shoulders hanging in despair at her sides as the realization hit her.\u00a0\u201cHe came back with the Soul Stone, and she didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 Quill pivoted on Thanos with sunken eyes. \u201cWhat&hellip;what did you do to her?! Asshole!\u201d he shouted wildly as he charged Thanos with raised fists and blazing eyes, but (Y/N) stopped him, pushing him away from the damage he was about to do.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cDon\u2019t engage! Quill, stop! Please!\u201d (Y/N) and Tony cried at him, but he tried to attack again. (Y/N) held him this time as his tears burned her neck in droplets that slipped down her collarbone. She pulled him close as she whispered to him over his shouts for vengeance,\u00a0\u201cI know. I know what he took from you. I know&hellip;he\u2019s gonna pay for what he took, and what he will take if we don\u2019t get the gauntlet from him. He <i>will </i>pay. I promise-\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cPay how?\u201d Quill suddenly whispered back, pulling away from her. \u201cDeath isn\u2019t enough for him,\u201d he choked out. It was chilling, even to (Y/N). From what she\u2019d seen of him, this guy was not a killer of any kind. Of course, she could pin this on the raging adrenaline that was coursing through his veins, the familiar rage that had burned inside of her since she found out her father had killed her mom and her sister. She could see it in his eyes, feel it in the tremble of his hands, but it was more than that. It was Gamora and everything that she meant to him. It was for all the decades of life that Thanos had stolen from them both. It was pain in it\u2019s rawest form. But more than anything, it was rational.</p><p>\u00a0 (Y/N) looked at him like she was looking into a mirror, and Quill stared back at her the same way. Pain connects people in a way that nothing else can.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re right&hellip;you\u2019re absolutely fucking right,\u201d (Y/N) whispered, her breath tinged in white tendrils as if they were speaking in the middle of a cold, winter\u2019s night. \u201cDeath is too good for him.\u201d It was a silent understanding between them when (Y/N) walked away from Quill, away from everyone. Quill remained grounded, watching Thanos with impassive eyes, knowing that he would pay. The enraged, broken sorceress would ensure that he would pay. He had to.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201c(Y/N),\u201d Strange warned, his voice rising in alarm as she continued to stride from the group. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWhat I should\u2019ve done from the beginning,\u201d she answered hollowly, turning apologetically to Tony. \u201cWhat you and Bruce warned me to do.\u201d She sighed as she removed the Power Stone from around her neck, placing it cautiously on a large boulder where it gleamed wickedly like the severed eye of some mystical creature long since forgotten. It seemed to wink at her before she turned her back on the wretched thing that had brought her so much misery for so many years. It came with great power that brought her strength and confidence and the life that she came to know with her weird little family, but at what cost? What was she willing to sacrifice for her own pride? Her own protection?</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201c(Y/N), don\u2019t!\u201d Strange ordered, trying to pull away from Thanos to stop her from what he knew she was planning, but the madman lurched forward in his dream-state, only Strange regaining control of him again. \u201cYou know what I saw in my vision-\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cScrew your fucking vision!\u201d she screamed back at him, an aura of raging violet plaguing the atmosphere around her. \u201cPlaying by your rules is gonna get everyone killed. At least this is a guaranteed win.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYou can\u2019t know that! He will find another way to reach his goal! He\u2019s not going to stop just because&hellip;(Y/N)! Are you listening to me?\u201d Strange scolded (Y/N), ignoring Tony\u2019s pleas to leave her alone. \u201c(Y/N)! He will find another way to-\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 (Y/N) turned her eyes on Strange, and he knew the fight was over. With one last glare at Thanos, then a softer glance towards Quill, she focused her targets on the Orb. Raising her palm, the world grew still. Graveyard still. The air was no longer stifling, it was bone-chilling. Colder than Siberia where (Y/N) spent her horror-filled days inside of Hydra. Where she was first introduced to the stone. Where some could possibly say her life went to shit for seven years. She didn\u2019t blame everything on the stone&hellip;but she could blame enough.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cThen I guess he\u2019ll have to find another way,\u201d she echoed.</p><p>\u00a0 With the war cry of an avalanche, (Y/N) released all the pent-up anger she had been building up towards Thanos. Every touch of his hands, every order he had given her, every single person he had killed for a broken cause that he deserved to die for, but she deemed this worse. For him to watch everything that he had worked centuries for, destroyed planets for, murdered his own daughter for, to watch it all burn out of existence by the same power he believed would restore balance to his perfect kingdom. That was one fate far worse than death.</p><p>\u00a0 As her power dissolved under her own fingertips, (Y/N) fell to her knees, watching the remnants of the Power Stone crumble to ash that cast itself into the taunting breeze. No longer did it laugh, though. No. The Universe was silent as if holding its breath for some sign that it could continue on.</p><p>\u00a0 But nobody dared to move. Not even Tony and Peter who had frozen in fear, hands still clutching the gauntlet that remained fastened to Thanos\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u00a0 Was it over? Could it really be over?</p><p>\u00a0 (Y/N) was the first to move, her aching limbs screeching at her to stay down, but she refused to listen. She stalked towards Thanos with her chin held high, balancing an invisible, fragile thing atop her head as she walked. One foot in front of the other. She crouched before him despite the smoke that still blinded his eyes, the moans of anguish still rising from his core.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cThere\u2019s your mercy,\u201d she spit at him, waiting for a retaliation that never came. She ventured a hesitant smile that grew the longer the seconds passed by that nothing happened. She wanted to feel completely at ease, but something heavy still hung in the air. Something unspeakable.\u00a0\u201cWhat? No more death threats? No more prophecies? You still haven\u2019t read my tea leaves, Miss Cleo,\u201d she taunted with a laugh. Maybe she was crazy. Maybe she\u2019d been driven mad by the stone, but she wanted to believe that the terror was over. That she could just go home. \u201cYour Yelp page is gonna need to seek out therapy after I get ahold of it. Might even need to Life Alert that shit-\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cUm, (Y/N)&hellip;\u201d Peter gasped, trying to gain her attention, but she continued her rant. Instead, Peter pointed towards the shimmering portion of the gauntlet just above Thanos\u2019s index finger, a deadly poison stirring within the halfway empty socket to restore the Power Stone. This time it was Tony who yelled at her, grabbing a fistful of her cloak at the nape of her neck like a scolded puppy to drag her over to the gauntlet, pushing her face towards the gemstone that winked back at her with a vicious grin.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 Like it knew how bad she had just fucked up.</p><p>\u00a0 She gaped, allowing the realization to dawn on her, back over her with a truck, then drag her for ten miles before she tumbled to the side of the highway like forgotten roadkill. And that\u2019s all she felt. Her decaying body swaying in the taunting breeze, resuming its laughter with roaring clarity.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 Suddenly, Thanos let out a dangerous moan&hellip;as if he was on the verge of waking up. (Y/N) could see his veins bulging from his arms against his struggle with Strange and Mantis, watching with wide eyes as his own pupils began to flinch back and forth inside of his sockets, searching for a way out.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cNo, no, <i>NO</i>!\u201d (Y/N) shrieked, grasping at the gauntlet with her numbed fingers, Tony and Peter following her lead, but her hands kept slipping off of the slick, golden surface. In her desperation, (Y/N) dug her nails into Thanos\u2019s arm, yanking herself onto his bicep, finding purchase in the nook of the gauntlet and his flesh underneath her boots. Using her body as leverage, she heaved her bodyweight against the gauntlet to pry it off of his wrist, Tony and Peter still pulling at his fingertips.</p><p>\u00a0 Gritting her teeth, she cursed and screamed at everyone and everything, allowing her adrenaline to push her weakening body onwards as it skyrocketed through her veins. Sweat poured from her hands and forehead, making it harder to lever herself, so she stabbed an ice blade into Thanos\u2019s bicep, making him howl. Somehow through the struggle, her stinging eyes found the sky, and all she could wonder was if there was really a place beyond Death.</p><p>\u00a0 But the planet went sideways as soon as Quill\u2019s fist met with Thanos\u2019s face for the final blow that brought the madman back to reality. (Y/N)\u2019s\u00a0body rolled over itself until she was face down in the dust, not knowing if anything was worth anything any longer. In the darkness of her closed eyes, she almost felt at peace. It would be so much easier to not move, to never open her eyes again. Her body felt like it was drifting inside of a dark float tank, not sensing that she was even touching the ground any longer. And it felt good. Sensational, even. Relieving. Fuck, what sweet relief.</p><p>\u00a0 Footsteps. Heavy, thundering, earth-moving, world-shattering footsteps. Him.</p><p>\u00a0 <i>Fucking asshole.</i></p><p>\u00a0 Her eyes shot open just as he reached down towards her, rolling onto her back, she thrust her open-palmed hand at Thanos\u2019s face, but nothing happened. She stared at her hand for a moment as her heart dropped into her stomach. She was defenseless. Carving his mouth into a grimace, Thanos admired his gauntlet apathetically, allowing the Power Stone\u2019s amethyst light to pulsate around his fist. With wide eyes, (Y/N) scrambled backward, reaching for a fallen sword that vanished in an array of bubbles. With a last ditch effort, (Y/N) picked up a stone and threw it at the Mad Titan as it bounced off of his armor with a pitiful click. Thanos raised his brow at her and she shrugged.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYou make do with what you got,\u201d (Y/N) said awkwardly just as Thanos closed his fist and the feeling of being strangled lifted her feet off of the ground. She grabbed at her neck to stop the choking, but all she could grasp was air.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cOf all my years in this Universe, you are the only one who continues to surprise me. But my patience has worn out with you, child. This was your final warning.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cThought you appreciated my determination. Take that back?\u201d (Y/N) choked out as Thanos wielded his gauntlet to bring her to him, but as soon as the spell broke, she did a backflip off his chest, unsheathing a blade from her side. They both circled each other, Thanos with feigned interest, but (Y/N) had only death in her glare.\u00a0\u201cYou aren\u2019t virtuous for this, no matter how much you\u2019ve convinced yourself otherwise. That you\u2019re some kind of <i>unsung hero\u00a0</i>of the Universe. In fact, Virtue Ethics could spit on your grave, and you\u2019d fucking deserve it.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s fascinating how you become bolder the more desperate you become.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cGo flatter yourself, Dickhead. You can\u2019t break me. Make me desperate. Many men have tried, and yet I\u2019m still here.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cSo am I.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cFor how long, though? How long do you really think you can outrun his vision?\u201d (Y/N) postulated, nodding her head over to Strange who watched with his magic sigils up, prepared for the fight.\u00a0\u201cIf his vision is true, then you are so screwed.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI highly doubt it,\u201d Thanos sneered.\u00a0\u201cI have seen my destiny and reveled in my path. Besides, you will long be dead before you become a threat to me.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cBold of you to assume that I want to live,\u201d she retorted with a smirk, but she remained vigilant, her feet never ceasing in their lethal motion. \u201cWhich brings up the question of how badly do you want to live? What if the Snap takes you out with the rest of us, huh? You said the Snap brings about a balance to anyone in the Universe, no matter who they are. If that\u2019s true, then what?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI am prepared for whatever my Destiny brings&hellip;even if that means my end.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 (Y/N) stopped in her tracks, looking the Mad Titan up and down, until she burst into laughter, throwing her body over a boulder to keep herself standing.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWhoa, whoa, whoa, wait a fucking minute!\u201d (Y/N) choked out through her confused tears, her body unable to hold back the outpour of her raw emotions any longer.\u00a0\u201c<i>You</i> mean to tell <i>me </i>that you\u2019re<i>\u00a0</i>completely<i>\u00a0</i>fine with the stone killing you? Not seeing the grand gratitude sweep the galaxy? See people prostrate at your, presumably, nasty-ass feet for <i>saving</i> them? You&rsquo;re not the slightest bit curious to <i>know</i> what the world will look like after you\u2019ve completed your mission?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 Thanos stared at her from across the plane, an absent gaze giving (Y/N) all the answers she needed as she slammed her fist against the rock.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cThen, what would have been the fucking point?!\u201d she screamed at him, enraged at his silence as she shook her head in horror.\u00a0\u201cAnswer me!\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYou have asked all of your questions, and I have constantly repeated my answer,\u201d Thanos mused.\u00a0\u201cI will not repeat myself again.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u201cYou\u2019re a robot. You have one function, and that is to murder. So, when I kill you, I will have no regrets,\u201d she threatened him, but Thanos just grinned at her. \u201cDon\u2019t look at me like that. First off, because it\u2019s disgusting. Second, I\u2019ve been underestimated before by countless bastards before, and since you claim to know me, and have\u00a0seen the things that I\u2019ve done&hellip;you know exactly what happened to them. You\u2019re no different. Make me your slave, and it will be the last thing you ever do.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 Silence fell over the plane as Thanos stopped dead in his tracks, facing (Y/N) with a pernicious smile, no longer seeing her as an ally, but now as his final conquest. The wind swept up the golden dust around him that turned black as it neared him, a foreboding future twisted beneath its veil.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cDeal,\u201d Thanos declared darkly as (Y/N) charged him viciously, dodging his first few blows, but she had lost her magic. She was still a skilled fighter trained by Natasha and Steve, quick and relentless, but not nearly good enough. He snatched her up once he was finished toying with her, the Power Stone holding her captive as she was forced to stand before him in front of all her allies who watched with fearful eyes. She could feel the heat of the gauntlet pressing against her temple, but she staunched the tears that were welling up behind her eyes.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 <i>If this is my last stand, let it be so. Kill me if you have to.</i></p><p>\u00a0 Gamora\u2019s last words to (Y/N) echoed through her mind. It ricocheted off memories she\u2019d created with her team, dreams she had with her friends, and a future she would never get to live with Steve, the only man she had ever loved.</p><p>\u00a0 But in the face of the deaths of half the Universe, she embraced the end with open arms, unafraid, and fearless.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 She met Tony\u2019s eyes as his mask fell away from his distraught face, slashes of blood decorated his strong features that gave her all the motivation she needed.</p><p>\u00a0 <i>It\u2019s time</i>, was the last message she sent to him in his mind and by the shudder of his shoulders, she knew he had received it. Thanos continued his rant about underappreciation as she watched Tony\u2019s arm lift towards her, tears rolling down his cheeks as he stared into her dauntless eyes, his hesitation damning if Thanos turned away from Strange. (Y/N) lifted her chin higher as she slowed her breath, allowing the noise to fall away, focusing only on her last word. She mouthed to him, <i>now</i>.</p><p>\u00a0 Strangling against his own scream, Tony lit his thrusters and pointed his targets at her, letting them burn and burn as he contemplated. But there wasn\u2019t anything to contemplate&hellip;he could never hurt any of his friends, not again. Even for this. (Y/N) may think this was the right thing to do, but Tony still had faith in Strange. Faith that he could keep the Time Stone safe long enough for his vision to come to pass.</p><p>\u00a0 Releasing his breath, he lowered his arm. But from the look on (Y/N)\u2019s face, he almost thought that he had shot her anyway. Her complexion paled so drastically, he wondered if someone<i> else</i> may have shot her. But nobody did. She really believed this was the only way.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cThis is your final warning, Wizard. No more tricks,\u201d Thanos called out, surveying his audience with thinly veiled impatience. (Y/N) struggled in his grasp, but her strength wasn\u2019t much without the stone. She refused to admit that this was the weakest point of her life. If Tony wasn\u2019t going to do something, she had to. But just as Tony lowered his arm, a ragged war cry belted from (Y/N)\u2019s left side where she turned to find Nebula with her blade thrust straight towards her heart. (Y/N)\u2019s lips parted to a relieved smile, beaming with irrational joy at the oncoming blade, accepting what it meant for the safety of everyone she loved.</p><p>\u00a0 But a burst of red magic shot the woman down. Tracing her eyes back towards Strange\u2019s smoldering hands, (Y/N) screamed in anger at him, cursing him out as she fought against Thanos\u2019s grasp, but all hope was lost when the blue, red, orange, and purple magic of the stones convulsed around her and Thanos in a forcefield that blocked any attempts of Tony\u2019s and Strange\u2019s to rescue her. She turned away from the\u00a0hex, but it was all too late as the venomous tendrils grasped at her body, lifting her into the air with the blood-curdling screams of a madwoman. The venom pierced through her skin like a million flame-licked needles that dug into every cell in her body. The searing pain threatened to melt her insides, incinerate her from the inside out. It was the most pain she had felt in her entire life. If she had desired death before&hellip;</p><p>\u00a0 Her tortured screams sliced through the hearts of everyone on the desolate wasteland, her excruciating pitch growing sharper the longer the torture was endured. Even after her voice gave out, her mouth hung open in silent horror as the stones continued to bury themselves into her chest, latching onto any life source they could to thrive in their new host. This wasn\u2019t a beautiful ceremony or even a morphine-induced surgery.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 This was hell.</p><p>\u00a0 Quill and Drax watched in horror, knowing better than anyone what it felt like to have the Power Stone rip through their bodies, to have their flesh torn off in a torture that made them cower in memory. But the thought of taking on the force of all the stones made Quill hold back his vomit, not able to break his gaze from the plaguing nightmare that ruined the girl before him. Peter held onto Mantis with all the strength that he had, but he couldn\u2019t resist his body from shaking, his bones trembling from the terror of it all, praying for it just to stop, but Thanos stood tall. He watched with fascination as her body convulsed against his power, ancient eyes studying her movements with mild interest, finally allowing her to fall to the ground in a heap at his feet.</p><p>\u00a0 He leaned down to prod her, waiting for the rise and fall of her chest that eventually came. Satisfied with his work, he commanded her to rise. But she remained on the ground. Only her head lolled to the side to find Tony, betrayal condemning her bruised and bloodied features.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWhat have you done?\u201d she croaked to him, but he couldn\u2019t hear her, only read her blue-tinted lips. Everything inside of him collapsed as he steadied himself against a boulder in agony.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cStand up!\u201d Thanos commanded again, forcing the curtain of blue to fall over her eyes, but this time was different. Everything was darker. Even when she tried to speak telepathically with Tony, her voice was shut down. She could barely think straight, each thought she had was interrupted by a golden light that she realized was the Mind Stone, enticing her to find it with an insatiable rapture.</p><p>\u00a0 And she was right back to the beginning. She would\u2019ve been frustrated had she not already forgotten where she was. All she knew was that her eyes were transfixed upon Thanos who beamed down at her with such pride that she felt her lips respond accordingly, relishing in his approval as a shadow-dwelling portal opened behind him. Everything still felt wrong and confusing until she was given her final orders.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cBring me the Mind Stone,\u201d Thanos directed her. She felt her head bow lowly before him as she turned into the portal, not bothering to look back as she forgot about everyone she was leaving behind to Thanos\u2019s sadism. All she could see was gold and Thanos\u2019s prideful smile.</p><p>\u00a0 It was the only thing that she wanted.

How far would you be willing to go to save someone who may be beyond saving? Is love measured by how you choose to protect someone, or by the amount of trust you have in them to let them go?</i></p><hr><p><b>T H A N O S\u00a0\u2018 S \u00a0- \u00a0S H I P</b></p><p>\u00a0 Perched on the lonesome chair that Thanos had <i>so kindly</i> provided for her, (Y/N) was still lost in her trance, her astral projection getting her message to Tony as best she could from the confines of the torture chamber where Nebula had once been. Eyes closed and legs crossed, she concentrated on the luminescent Power Stone that warmed her curled fingertips despite the cavern\u2019s icy chill that drafted through the hollow chamber like passing spirits in the night.</p><p>\u00a0 The sound of metal scraping against metal brought her astral body back to her physical form as the Power Stone settled against her chest. She felt confident in her delivery to Tony. He would make the right choice to kill her if it came down to it. He knew more than anyone what it meant to make the hard decisions when nobody else could. It was a promise.</p><p>\u00a0 Scrambling for normalcy as the heavy doors slid upwards, (Y/N) leaned back in her chair, arms folded across her chest as she traced a casual smirk across her lips to welcome back the Mad Titan. It had only been a few hours of his absence but had she really forgotten how intimidating he was? Even his taut muscles that seemed to be carved from stone by Ares as a monument to war, paled in comparison to the iron in his eyes. Their overpowering nature made it painfully easy for her to see how he had stricken fear into the hearts of so many for so long without anyone raising a fist in objection.</p><p>\u00a0 And at that moment, despite not showing it, she wished that she were an exception.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cBack so soon?\u201d (Y/N) crooned at him poisonously.\u00a0\u201cAnd to think, I was just getting used to <i>not</i> thinking about killing innocent people. What a crazy idea, huh? You should try it sometime. Really soothes the soul.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cCease your patronizing,\u201d Thanos ordered lowly as he towered before her. \u201cIt\u2019s growing tiresome. Even from you.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cThen send me back Earth and you won\u2019t have to hear it anymore,\u201d (Y/N) postulated with the cock of her head and a poised smile.</p><p>\u00a0 Thanos grinned back at her viscously, making her own simper falter.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cThere are more ways than one to make you cooperate, child,\u201d Thanos threatened as he raised his gauntlet that was exuding the familiar blue light that made (Y/N)\u2019s stomach churn in anticipation.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cSo, you\u2019re really about to do this?\u201d (Y/N) stalled, jolting upright from her chair.\u00a0\u201cWithout taking even a moment to question this, this <i>genocide</i> that you\u2019re about to commit. Question your moralities? Your judgment? You can still change your mind. Still, make the right decision here.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ve had centuries to mull over the possibilities in my head,\u201d Thanos responded. \u201cI no longer have doubts to stop me from what I must do.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cAnd that\u2019s why you killed your daughter, right? Because you thought <i>so</i> hard on it?\u201d (Y/N) pinned him as his body tensed at her words. She sneered disgustedly at him. \u201cProbably\u00a0should\u2019ve taken more time on that one.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 Thanos grimaced towards the wall beside him as he cracked his meat slab of a neck, it\u2019s sound vibrating against the titanium in a sickening crunch. Returning his attention to the defiant warrior before him, he watched the unwieldy winter storm that brewed violently behind her eyes, reminding him of how lethal she would be if only she realized her true power. But she wouldn\u2019t. Not in time, anyway.</p><p>\u00a0 His grimace became more relaxed at his realization as he raised his fist once again.\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t know which will kill you first. Your shallow pride, your recklessness\u2026or me.\u201d And with those words, the Space Stone recaptured (Y/N)\u2019s mind, it\u2019s tendrils becoming entangled with every fiber of her being, wrapping itself like a parasite around her veins.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 Thanos had to respect her, though. Despite the pain he knew that the mind control caused her (more greatly than most since the Space Stone was also lending itself to her own abilities, combining with the Orb\u2019s power), the girl never flinched. Her razor-sharp gaze never left his own until they were veiled by a curtain of sapphire blue, finally lowering with her knee to the floor in prostration.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"400\" data-orig-height=\"225\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"dimensao7:y69j3WcY_8MMUoX5mkPEQg:ZywZ8w2Eefm6p\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/724aa03150858724f9633bfdf53d417c/tumblr_ogm1pc3LjU1rnbafjo1_400.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"400\" data-orig-height=\"225\"></figure><p>\u00a0 The slight pain that shot through his own chest surprised him as he wished that her cooperation was that of her own instead of through force, wishing once again for the apprentice-like relationship that he had had with Gamora.</p><p>\u00a0 He shook away his apprehension with ease as he commanded her to stand, observing the ethereal grace of his weapon with a faint satisfaction.</p><hr><p><b>T I T A N</b></p><p>\u00a0 Strange swallowed his trepidation, wearing a mask of neutrality as he watched the growing portal of shadows part way to Thanos, the psychopath of the century. His figure was jarring to the sorcerer despite the visions he had seen, the reality of Thanos\u2019s overwhelming presence\u00a0making him shuffle slightly in his seat atop the stone staircase above the Mad Titan.</p><p>\u00a0 As the portal dissipated, Thanos\u2019s eyes surveyed the apocalyptic landscape of his once flourishing home planet. The taunting breeze shifted the dirt to make the city appear to still be smoking as if the planet had just collapsed that very morning under flames and tragedy. It laughed at him wickedly. Thanos winced in memory.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cOh, yeah. You\u2019re much more of a Thanos,\u201d Strange remarked boldly, grasping Thanos\u2019s attention from his harrowing reverie. It was at that point when Thanos began to stalk towards the sorcerer that Strange understood the depths of his own trepidation, taking in Thanos\u2019s calculated steps with observant eyes.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201c(Y/N) has already informed me of the Maw\u2019s death,\u201d Thanos mused to Strange, which twitched the corners of Strange\u2019s lips into a smirk, remembering the\u00a0well-deserved beheading on the Maw\u2019s own ship. \u201cThis day extracts a heavy toll. Still, he accomplished his mission.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYou may regret that,\u201d Strange returned with a flick of his marred eyebrow. \u201cHe brought you face-to-face with the Master of the Mystic Arts.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cAnd where do you think he brought you?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cLet me guess. Your home?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 Thanos laughed humorlessly, placing a foot atop a fallen piece of debris as he launched into Titan\u2019s tragic backstory (complete with a Reality-Stone-induced projection of the planet at it\u2019s best, how generous!).</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m a survivor,\u201d Thanos announced, almost proudly.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWho wants to murder trillions,\u201d Strange retorted.</p><p>\u00a0 \u201cWith all six stones, I could simply snap my fingers and they would all cease to exist,\u201d Thanos said.\u00a0\u201cI call that\u2026mercy.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cAnd then what?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI\u2019d finally rest and watch the sun rise on a grateful Universe,\u201d Thanos answered with a relieved sigh. He turned towards the\u00a0smog-filled skies that bared its weight upon the planet like a falling building. The atmosphere itself was claustrophobic. It made him yearn for the days of fresh air and blue skies from his youth, but he pulled himself from his desires, focusing once again on the sorcerer before him. \u201c\u2026that is, with my greatest accomplice.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 Thanos grinned as he clenched his fist to open another shadow-filled portal. Blue and grey curls of smoke poured from the Stygian dimension to allow for an even darker silhouette to approach, a figure concealed by a pitch-black hooded cloak lined in silver detailing as wickedly sharp as the ice-wielded blades at the figure\u2019s sides. Stepping from the portal, the figure lifted her hood to reveal a masked face, only her eyes and {your colored} hair visible. The wild, flyaway baby hairs were easily recognizable, but the emotionless blue tint of her eyes made Strange suck in a breath.</p><p>\u00a0 From his place above the scene on the edge of a decrepit building, Peter had to shove his hand over his mouth to keep from shouting at her. Tony had warned him that (Y/N) would be there and that she might look different, but using his suit to take a closer inspection of her eyes, he could barely recognize her. No hint of the sly, teasing smile that she almost always wore, or the strong, young, foster home girl that his aunt had taken in so many years ago. The one that helped him through his first crush\u2026and the death of his uncle. It was like looking at a wax figure of one of his childhood heroes.</p><p>\u00a0 Even Tony had to stifle his own heartache when he asked Friday to hack into Peter\u2019s viewfinder to see (Y/N) for himself. This was worse than Clint. Even worse than when Wanda had possessed Bruce. Like Peter, he couldn\u2019t see a trace of his person anywhere in the face of the girl that stood beside that shriveled up monster.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 But he couldn\u2019t say that (Y/N) hadn\u2019t warned him. Even if the hallucination he saw was all in his head, a figment of his anxiety-riddled mind, he knew this day would haunt him for the rest of his life.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cSurprised, are you?\u201d Thanos boasted at Strange, letting out a deep laugh that seemed to rumble the ground beneath him.\u00a0\u201cIt took a bit of persuading, but the Space Stone finally allowed her to see my vision at it\u2019s fullest potential. I think you\u2019ll find her much more tolerable now with the discipline she has learned in our short time together.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cThis is what you call mercy?\u201d Strange choked out, managing to not stumble over his words despite what he was seeing. His close ally that he would now have to fight somehow. Of all of his visions, this was one of the ones he desperately pleaded not to come to pass. But it was the path that had to be walked.</p><p>\u00a0 Thanos crouched beside (Y/N), brushing his thumb over her cheek to disengage the black, silken mask over her face, lingering ever so slightly on her high cheekbone as he leaned towards her just to taunt Strange who balled his fists at his side with sparks of raging red.\u00a0\u201cHe desires to witness mercy, my child,\u201d Thanos mocked, taking a glance at the sorcerer.\u00a0\u201cShow him what he wishes for.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 Immediately, (Y/N) raised her hands in front of her, palms towards the sky as blue and purple magic intertwined on her fingertips like strands of DNA. Eyes still locked on the empty space in front of her, everyone was lifted into the stifling atmosphere from their cover positions. Peter, Quill, Drax, and Mantis all hovered in mid-air before the sorceress like something out of <i>Poltergeist</i>, all trying to fight her control, but her power was relentless. Even Strange tried to break them out, but his magic bounced back and almost paralyzed him as he ducked and rolled away.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s pitiful that they think they can hide from us,\u201d (Y/N) taunted with a wicked smile that was like nothing Peter had ever seen worn by her before as she turned to Thanos.\u00a0\u201cWhat would you like me to do with them?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 Thanos looked out over his conquests with arms folded over his chest, taking in a content breath.\u00a0\u201cLet them live,\u201d he ordered, then turned to (Y/N),\u00a0\u201cfor now.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 The smug look on her face grew even darker as she moved her arms in an outward sweeping motion that catapulted Mantis and Quill to the left while Drax and Peter were thrown into an archway on the right that crumbled to ash.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 Although he looked thoroughly shellshocked, Strange stood his ground, approaching the edge of the dais with his chin held high.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cSo, what is she now? Your bodyguard?\u201d Strange barked at Thanos, giving a longing look to (Y/N), but it was like staring at the bottom of the ocean. Hauntingly dark and absolutely lifeless. But he knew she was in there. Somewhere. She had to be.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cMore of a guarantee that the stones will find their way into the right hand,\u201d Thanos answered with a fond glance at (Y/N) who stood as a sentry beside him.</p><p>\u00a0 But before Strange could respond, he heard Tony\u2019s warning just prior to witnessing the large stalactite the size of a city bus that Tony was holding come hurtling straight down towards Thanos and (Y/N), preparing to crush them like ants under a boot. Quick reflexes leant to Strange\u2019s magic being shot towards (Y/N) to move her out of the way, but she was quicker. Thrusting forward her own hand, she sent his red beam barreling back at him like a bullet which he narrowly dodged as he watched a lilac-tinted forcefield appear around Thanos and (Y/N). The moment the stalactite hit the forcefield, it shattered like sand in a kid\u2019s playground around them in a shower of golden dust that beamed in the starlight.</p><p>\u00a0 With her other hand outstretched towards the sky, (Y/N) waited for the dust to settle until she spotted the red and gold suit gleaming under her amethyst spell where he thrashed to try and escape. A fly caught in her spider\u2019s web.</p><p>\u00a0 Tony witnessed the same gruesome smile split her striking features, not prepared to experience what it felt like to be her enemy, just as she twisted her wrist that sent him soaring across the abandoned planet, slamming into the cursed donut ship that brought him there in the first place.</p><p>\u00a0 With a groan, Tony shoved a large piece of metal from the old, battered ship off of his suit, barely managing to sit upright as he shook himself off.</p><p>\u00a0 \u201cHe wants to fight dirty,\u201d Tony snarled to Friday, preparing his arsenal with deadly precision. \u201cThen, let\u2019s fight dirty.\u201d</p><hr><p>\u00a0 This was the worst. The actual fucking worst. (Y/N) would have rather spent seven more years suffering through torture after torture inside the nightmare-inducing corridors of Hydra than be where she was now. Whatever subhuman horrors they would\u2019ve had lined up for her would\u2019ve been eagerly accepted by the girl who was slamming her fists against the walls of her mind. Fist after fist, she pounded and screamed and begged for her body to break free from its bondage, but she was trapped. Borderline hopeless as she was forced to watch her torture her own friends and what seemed like allies, watching as her magic easily tossed their bodies back and forth across the dusty plane, only getting knocked back a few times when they teamed up against her.</p><p>\u00a0 She hoped they would team up against her. Rooted for them to take her the fuck out. But she could see the obvious restraint they held against her, especially Peter and Tony. She could see the immediate difference between Tony dropping literal bombshells on Thanos versus him just trying to knock (Y/N) off of her feet long enough to knock her unconscious. But she swatted him aside time and time again.</p><p>\u00a0 In a battle between her and Tony, she got him pinned to the ground, ice katana hovering over his arch reactor before his thruster knocked it from her grasp. But all she had to do was manipulate another one that drilled a hole into the dirt right next to his head that he just barely managed to dodge.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYou know, you\u2019re taking this a bit far if you\u2019re still mad about Siberia,\u201d he quipped at her, widening his eyes when only a low snarl escaped her lips. Somehow, Tony blasted her off of him, but it was a weak blow.</p><p>\u00a0 <i>The only way to stop him is to stop me</i>, (Y/N) sent out to Tony, her voice echoing in the back of his mind, but he shook it away, still believing it was just his anxiety trying to sneak up on him again (which it was, but the voice was very much real). <i>Oh, and they call me the stubborn one</i>, (Y/N) groaned in annoyance which made Tony\u2019s eyebrows furrow, but again, he denied her warnings.</p><p>\u00a0 <i>For fuck\u2019s sake! What does a girl have to do to get her best friend to kill her in order to save the Universe? </i>(Y/N) thought to herself glumly, biting back the dark laughter that was rising inside of her at the nonsensical situation Thanos had put her and the entire Universe into. If she got the chance to kill him\u2026</p><p>\u00a0 <i>WHACK.\u00a0</i></p><p>\u00a0 The crunch of bones reverberated in (Y/N)\u2019s head as her skull cracked against something hard and metallic. The pain was blinding as she crumpled to the ground, but all she could think about was how unfair it was that even when she couldn\u2019t control her body, she still had to suffer through the pain that her puppet body went through. Seriously, what the hell?</p><p>\u00a0 Her eyes focused in and out, the blue curtain fading as she blinked furiously to fight against the Space Stone, but the mind control won out over her. <i>Damn</i>. All the attack did was piss off her alter-ego that turned to face the open-mouthed ally that she guessed Tony referred to as, the \u2018Space Cowboy.\u2019 He grinned awkwardly at her as she gritted her teeth at him wickedly, the reflection of her own face in the abandoned metal ship beside her frightening (Y/N) to her core. She never knew that she could terrify herself, and yet\u2026</p><p>\u00a0 She felt her neck twitch to the side which sent the Space Cowboy on a trip through the air as he crashed to the ground, rolling over himself until his back snapped hard against a large boulder. Watching it, she could feel her own spine react violently, her ears filling in the whip-like crack that she didn\u2019t actually hear. Could only know from experience. Standing, she stalked across the blinding sands with her eyes focused on the man who still groaned in agony on in the dirt.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 From her peripheral, she caught sight of the blue-tinted alien she recognized as Nebula. The woman charged at her with a razor-sharp, electrically-charged blade that gleamed wickedly in the rays of whatever poor star had the burden of lighting this deserted hellhole. Without taking her eyes from her initial target, (Y/N)\u2019s hand struck with cobra-like precision to her left, grasping ahold of Nebula\u2019s blade with inhuman strength. Despite the crimson blood that seeped from the palm of her hand, (Y/N) turned on Nebula with such a dark expression that even the assassin was forced to gape with fear. Nebula tried to remember the feisty girl who had desperately attempted to break her out of Thanos\u2019s torture chamber with the help of her own sister, but that girl wasn\u2019t who she was facing now. She could only see the sadistic tendencies of her own father mirrored back at her from the stranger\u2019s gemstone eyes.</p><p>\u00a0 Taking advantage of Nebula\u2019s incapacitated fear, (Y/N) tore the blade from Nebula\u2019s grasp, using the hilt to backhand across the woman\u2019s face to knock her unconscious in a single devastating motion. Nebula\u2019s limp body hit the ground with a thud at (Y/N)\u2019s feet, but the sorceress continued her march towards her target with only a distant apathy and the splatter of Nebula\u2019s blood adorning her features. The blade dropped to the ground with a sharp clatter right next to Nebula\u2019s head, but the woman\u2019s body remained still.</p><p>\u00a0 (Y/N) watched with hollow, hungry eyes as the man who had attacked her attempted to stand, grasping the edges of the rock behind him like it was his last hope. And maybe it was. However, just before she reached him, Thanos\u2019s strangled groans caught her attention. She whipped her head around to the aid of her Master as he fought against Strange in a massive battle of magic versus magic. It reminded her of the Boss stage in a video game, but more vibrant and tangible than she could\u2019ve ever imagined. She could almost taste the magic as it seared the atmosphere in violent color like laser beams across the sky.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 Forgetting the pathetic human, (Y/N)\u2019s body began to lithely snake its way towards Strange, apparently planning to take him out from behind like a dirty coward. Using her magic, she maneuvered some stone fragments to form a path for her to reach the cliffside that Strange was fighting from. She couldn\u2019t help feeling like she really was in a video game, reality slipping further and further away from her as the minutes passed by and the mind control continued to drip like poison into her bloodstream.</p><p>\u00a0 Finally in position, (Y/N) raised her hand to take him out, the beam of amethyst magic convulsing against her palm to end this pitiful battle that only served as a minor inconvenience to her Master\u2019s vision. To end the life of Stephen Strange.</p><p>\u00a0 But at the last moment, her sights were blinded by a sweeping kick to the back of her head that sent her sprawling to the ground far below. The stones she upheld crashed down around her as soon as she hit the dirt, smashing her head against a piece of rock halfway down that jutted from the cliffside.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 A swinging flash of red and blue spotted her memory as she opened her eyes again and rolled to her side, pulling her index finger away from her forehead to reveal a stream of blood. With a groan, her\u00a0hand dropped to the ground like a dead fish. Through her rapid blinking into the oddly lit sky, she realized that her sight was clear. No blue film. No mind control. She was free\u2026for now. But probably not for long. Her eyes almost popped out of her head with shock, but she stifled herself when she saw Thanos from across the plane. He was still battling it out against Strange and Peter, slamming the teenager who had just knocked her out of Thanos\u2019s grasp into the dirt with the force of a semi-truck.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 She barely managed to reel herself in from protecting Peter and not blow her cover before Thanos released him. Taking a breath, (Y/N) used the small amount of power she had received from the Space Stone to disguise her eyes back into the blue tint as she stood, forcing her body to remain as rigid and robotic as possible to convey that she was still under his control, taking a moment to calm the Orb that was growing warmer by the minute around her neck as her anger took a dangerous turn. But she had to remain calm, unbothered, emotionless.</p><p>\u00a0 She continued her trek across the sands, praying for nobody to contest her until she reached Thanos\u2019s side. All she needed was to get close enough to him\u2026she just needed to get there\u2026she just needed to-</p><p>\u00a0 And there was this fucking guy. The colorful language that suddenly swarmed her head could have filled a sixty-four pack of Crayola crayons. She heard his allies call him,\u00a0\u201cDrax,\u201d which seemed\u2026fitting, as he charged at her, yelling as he went, pecs out to play, swords dancing in the sky like parade batons.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 (Y/N) couldn\u2019t help rolling her eyes as she sent him sprawling across the sky like a guy who had just gotten a rather rude awakening after he fell asleep inside of a circus cannon (weird comparison, but it paints the perfect picture).</p><p>\u00a0 Finally, she reached Thanos\u2019s side where they combined the power of their stones to break through Strange\u2019s mirror dimension shield that flipped him backward off of his cliff point that exploded into a rainfall of dust. She knew that it wasn\u2019t a deadly blow, but it would keep him down for a minute, just long enough for her to do what needed to be done.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cMy child, you continue to impress me,\u201d Thanos complimented her with a condescending tone that made her want to rip his tongue out, but she would be patient. Even when he placed his hand on her shoulder, she remained a marble statue, the perfect soldier at perfect ease.\u00a0\u201cBut what would truly impress me would be if you retrieved me the Mind <i>and </i>Time Stone. Do not fail me as\u2026.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 Thanos trailed off as Tony landed in front of him like a meteor striking the dirt, thrusters flaring at the madman with the intensity of a dragon\u2019s breath.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be a failure if she was doing the right thing,\u201d Tony quipped.\u00a0\u201cNot that you know what the right thing is, even if it hit you in the face. But let\u2019s test out that theory, anyhow\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cStark,\u201d Thanos mused hauntingly, giving Tony pause.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYou know me?\u201d He demanded.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI do,\u201d Thanos grinned. \u201cI\u2019ve watched over you and (Y/N) for quite some time now. You\u2019re not the only one cursed with knowledge.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cMy only curse is you,\u201d Tony spit as he prepared to attack, but his eyes caught a flicker of silver inconspicuously slice through the air at (Y/N)\u2019s wrist like a wisp of candlelight. At the same moment, he glimpsed a shift in her face, a warning to stay back.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0Thanos only gave a curt, cold laugh at Tony\u2019s response.\u00a0\u201cNo, I wouldn\u2019t imagine you to agree with what I am here to do. That\u2019s alright. I am not here to negotiate. Tell your\u00a0friend to hand over the stone, and no one else has to get hurt. I know you would do anything to protect those you love.\u201d Thanos bolstered, stroking the length of (Y/N)\u2019s hair with deadly precision. It set Tony\u2019s teeth on edge, but he flashed another glance at her blades and instead let out a dramatic sigh.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cAgain, have to admit. He\u2019s still not my friend. Good guy, not the best with the sense of humor. Could work on loosening up the old cloak strings, if you know what I mean. Maybe you two could start a social group together-\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cEnough!\u201d Thanos bellowed, but the moment he took his first step towards Tony, both of (Y/N)\u2019s blades sunk deep into his once impenetrable flesh, one through his chest while the other found it\u2019s mark far below the belt.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cCongratulations, you finally found your balls,\u201d (Y/N) purred at the Mad Titan as he was brought to his knees, blood frothing from his mouth through his guttural roars of pain that threatened to choke him at each breath, but (Y/N) wouldn\u2019t let up. She only leaned\u00a0in harder to press her blades deeper into his body as a daring smile lit up her clear eyes, amethyst smoke curling from her nose. Thanos couldn\u2019t take his eyes off of her. The shock that she had caught him unguarded was written in bloody ink across his disturbed features.</p><p>\u00a0 Tony was in a state of shock as well. He stared in awe at the power and control (Y/N) displayed over possibly the strongest person in the galaxy. The rapid change in events left him speechless, but (Y/N) broke him out of his stupor pretty quickly when she whipped her head towards him with eyes as intense as wildfire, preparing to reduce everything that stood in her way to ash.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cThe gauntlet, moron! Get the fucking gauntlet!\u201d She commanded him breathlessly, turning back to Thanos as she struggled to hold him down. A few moments later, Drax slid across the dust like he was sliding to home plate, \u00a0grabbing ahold of Thanos\u2019s left leg, Peter behind him with a web across the blade in Thanos\u2019s chest, while Quill dropped a weapon that held down Thanos\u2019s left arm. Strange miraculously appeared over the horizon lifted by his cape to cast a portal over Thanos\u2019s head to drop Mantis onto his oversized shoulders where she tapped his temples with her fingertips to lull him into a deep, nightmarish sleep, his hollow eyes swirling with musky smoke as his tensed muscles relaxed slightly. He was still fighting, but it was as if he were trying to run a mile through the ocean. The current always pulled him back.</p><p>\u00a0 Tony launched himself at the gauntlet, seizing the golden beacon with a desperation like he\u2019d never felt before. This was their chance. This was the moment that would change everything. This was it.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cIs he under? Don\u2019t let up!\u201d Tony encouraged Mantis.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cBe quick! He is very strong!\u201d She cried out, grappling against Thanos\u2019s brutal attempts to block her out of his mind, but she was determined to not back down. She knew who she was fighting for.</p><p>\u00a0 Tony called for Peter to help him get the gauntlet, both heaving it slowly out of place. Like insanely slowly. Like the Mariana Trench dug itself an extra ten feet in the time it took them to slide the gauntlet even an inch off of Thanos\u2019s wrist.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cSo, (Y/N),\u201d Tony said, testing to see if his hallucination was real or not, \u201cstill want me to kill you?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 (Y/N) just scoffed at him through gritted teeth.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cCall this Plan B,\u201d she challenged, not taking her burning eyes off of Thanos until she peered up at Mantis.\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re not taking any of his pain away, right?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cNo! He is still in anguish!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cGood,\u201d (Y/N) whispered as she forced her blades even deeper, feeling him struggle beneath her bloody hands. Without hesitation, she allowed herself to relish the revenge. She didn\u2019t notice Quill saunter up behind her until he spoke.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cPlan B?\u201d he scoffed, thoroughly startling (Y/N). In any other situation, a blade would\u2019ve been pulled on his ass. \u201cThis is Plan A. <i>My</i>\u00a0Plan A that, for the record, totally worked,\u201d he boasted, pointing towards Strange who rolled his eyes.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cShut up, Sideburns and go sit down if you\u2019re gonna be a prick,\u201d (Y/N) snarled at him, making the man scoff again as he cleared his throat.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s Starlord,\u201d he announced boisterously in a much deeper voice, managing to puff out his chest indignantly despite (Y/N)\u2019s glare.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cBy choice?\u201d She threw back at him, making Peter almost lose his grip on the gauntlet trying not to laugh, but Tony ordered him to stay focused.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cYes, by choice-\u201d Quill began to argue, but a low moan escaped Thanos which drew his attention instead.\u00a0\u201cHa! Not so strong now, huh\u2026where\u2019s Gamora?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 (Y/N) froze as she felt the color drain from her face. At the mention of her name, (Y/N) felt like she couldn\u2019t breathe, a cold sweat breaking out across her brow. Her chest tightened along with the grip on her blades that made her knuckles turn a deathly, skeletal white.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201c\u2026<i>my Gamora</i>,\u201d Thanos growled out.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cNo, bullshit,\u201d Quill swore just as (Y/N) finally found her voice again.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYou know Gamora?\u201d she breathed out, just barely loud enough for Quill to hear. He turned to her with wide eyes.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYeah\u2026\u201d Quill said slowly, narrowing his eyes at her.\u00a0\u201cYeah, she\u2019s my girlfriend\u2026why? Did you see her? Do you know where she is?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 Oh, it hurt. It hurt so fucking bad.</p><p>\u00a0 (Y/N)\u2019s eyes flicked towards the ground, then back at Quill.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYou know where she is, don\u2019t you? Tell me! Please!\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI\u2026I will explain everything when this is all over. Once we get the gauntlet, I will tell you-\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWhy not now? Why not\u2026no\u2026\u201d Quill gasped as he turned on Thanos, shaking his head numbly at the madman, refusing to believe what he was hearing.\u00a0\u201cNo\u2026tell me you didn\u2019t! Tell me you didn\u2019t\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 Thanos struggled to speak, either choked up by the spell that cursed him, or the images that were flashing through his mind of what he had done.</p><p>\u00a0 \u201cHe-he mourns!\u201d Mantis stammered out as (Y/N) nodded over to Strange who nodded back to her, giving her the go-ahead to release her grip on the hilts of her blades as she turned to face Quill, but Nebula spoke before (Y/N) got the chance. The woman\u2019s figure began to wilt as she spoke.</p><p>\u00a0 \u201cGamora\u2026he took her to Vormir,\u201d Nebula stated coldly, her shoulders hanging in despair at her sides as the realization hit her.\u00a0\u201cHe came back with the Soul Stone, and she didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 Quill pivoted on Thanos with sunken eyes. \u201cWhat\u2026what did you do to her?! Asshole!\u201d he shouted wildly as he charged Thanos with raised fists and blazing eyes, but (Y/N) stopped him, pushing him away from the damage he was about to do.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cDon\u2019t engage! Quill, stop! Please!\u201d (Y/N) and Tony cried at him, but he tried to attack again. (Y/N) held him this time as his tears burned her neck in droplets that slipped down her collarbone. She pulled him close as she whispered to him over his shouts for vengeance,\u00a0\u201cI know. I know what he took from you. I know\u2026he\u2019s gonna pay for what he took, and what he will take if we don\u2019t get the gauntlet from him. He <i>will </i>pay. I promise-\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cPay how?\u201d Quill suddenly whispered back, pulling away from her. \u201cDeath isn\u2019t enough for him,\u201d he choked out. It was chilling, even to (Y/N). From what she\u2019d seen of him, this guy was not a killer of any kind. Of course, she could pin this on the raging adrenaline that was coursing through his veins, the familiar rage that had burned inside of her since she found out her father had killed her mom and her sister. She could see it in his eyes, feel it in the tremble of his hands, but it was more than that. It was Gamora and everything that she meant to him. It was for all the decades of life that Thanos had stolen from them both. It was pain in it\u2019s rawest form. But more than anything, it was rational.</p><p>\u00a0 (Y/N) looked at him like she was looking into a mirror, and Quill stared back at her the same way. Pain connects people in a way that nothing else can.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re right\u2026you\u2019re absolutely fucking right,\u201d (Y/N) whispered, her breath tinged in white tendrils as if they were speaking in the middle of a cold, winter\u2019s night. \u201cDeath is too good for him.\u201d It was a silent understanding between them when (Y/N) walked away from Quill, away from everyone. Quill remained grounded, watching Thanos with impassive eyes, knowing that he would pay. The enraged, broken sorceress would ensure that he would pay. He had to.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201c(Y/N),\u201d Strange warned, his voice rising in alarm as she continued to stride from the group. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWhat I should\u2019ve done from the beginning,\u201d she answered hollowly, turning apologetically to Tony. \u201cWhat you and Bruce warned me to do.\u201d She sighed as she removed the Power Stone from around her neck, placing it cautiously on a large boulder where it gleamed wickedly like the severed eye of some mystical creature long since forgotten. It seemed to wink at her before she turned her back on the wretched thing that had brought her so much misery for so many years. It came with great power that brought her strength and confidence and the life that she came to know with her weird little family, but at what cost? What was she willing to sacrifice for her own pride? Her own protection?</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201c(Y/N), don\u2019t!\u201d Strange ordered, trying to pull away from Thanos to stop her from what he knew she was planning, but the madman lurched forward in his dream-state, only Strange regaining control of him again. \u201cYou know what I saw in my vision-\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cScrew your fucking vision!\u201d she screamed back at him, an aura of raging violet plaguing the atmosphere around her. \u201cPlaying by your rules is gonna get everyone killed. At least this is a guaranteed win.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYou can\u2019t know that! He will find another way to reach his goal! He\u2019s not going to stop just because\u2026(Y/N)! Are you listening to me?\u201d Strange scolded (Y/N), ignoring Tony\u2019s pleas to leave her alone. \u201c(Y/N)! He will find another way to-\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 (Y/N) turned her eyes on Strange, and he knew the fight was over. With one last glare at Thanos, then a softer glance towards Quill, she focused her targets on the Orb. Raising her palm, the world grew still. Graveyard still. The air was no longer stifling, it was bone-chilling. Colder than Siberia where (Y/N) spent her horror-filled days inside of Hydra. Where she was first introduced to the stone. Where some could possibly say her life went to shit for seven years. She didn\u2019t blame everything on the stone\u2026but she could blame enough.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cThen I guess he\u2019ll have to find another way,\u201d she echoed.</p><p>\u00a0 With the war cry of an avalanche, (Y/N) released all the pent-up anger she had been building up towards Thanos. Every touch of his hands, every order he had given her, every single person he had killed for a broken cause that he deserved to die for, but she deemed this worse. For him to watch everything that he had worked centuries for, destroyed planets for, murdered his own daughter for, to watch it all burn out of existence by the same power he believed would restore balance to his perfect kingdom. That was one fate far worse than death.</p><p>\u00a0 As her power dissolved under her own fingertips, (Y/N) fell to her knees, watching the remnants of the Power Stone crumble to ash that cast itself into the taunting breeze. No longer did it laugh, though. No. The Universe was silent as if holding its breath for some sign that it could continue on.</p><p>\u00a0 But nobody dared to move. Not even Tony and Peter who had frozen in fear, hands still clutching the gauntlet that remained fastened to Thanos\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u00a0 Was it over? Could it really be over?</p><p>\u00a0 (Y/N) was the first to move, her aching limbs screeching at her to stay down, but she refused to listen. She stalked towards Thanos with her chin held high, balancing an invisible, fragile thing atop her head as she walked. One foot in front of the other. She crouched before him despite the smoke that still blinded his eyes, the moans of anguish still rising from his core.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cThere\u2019s your mercy,\u201d she spit at him, waiting for a retaliation that never came. She ventured a hesitant smile that grew the longer the seconds passed by that nothing happened. She wanted to feel completely at ease, but something heavy still hung in the air. Something unspeakable.\u00a0\u201cWhat? No more death threats? No more prophecies? You still haven\u2019t read my tea leaves, Miss Cleo,\u201d she taunted with a laugh. Maybe she was crazy. Maybe she\u2019d been driven mad by the stone, but she wanted to believe that the terror was over. That she could just go home. \u201cYour Yelp page is gonna need to seek out therapy after I get ahold of it. Might even need to Life Alert that shit-\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cUm, (Y/N)\u2026\u201d Peter gasped, trying to gain her attention, but she continued her rant. Instead, Peter pointed towards the shimmering portion of the gauntlet just above Thanos\u2019s index finger, a deadly poison stirring within the halfway empty socket to restore the Power Stone. This time it was Tony who yelled at her, grabbing a fistful of her cloak at the nape of her neck like a scolded puppy to drag her over to the gauntlet, pushing her face towards the gemstone that winked back at her with a vicious grin.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 Like it knew how bad she had just fucked up.</p><p>\u00a0 She gaped, allowing the realization to dawn on her, back over her with a truck, then drag her for ten miles before she tumbled to the side of the highway like forgotten roadkill. And that\u2019s all she felt. Her decaying body swaying in the taunting breeze, resuming its laughter with roaring clarity.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 Suddenly, Thanos let out a dangerous moan\u2026as if he was on the verge of waking up. (Y/N) could see his veins bulging from his arms against his struggle with Strange and Mantis, watching with wide eyes as his own pupils began to flinch back and forth inside of his sockets, searching for a way out.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cNo, no, <i>NO</i>!\u201d (Y/N) shrieked, grasping at the gauntlet with her numbed fingers, Tony and Peter following her lead, but her hands kept slipping off of the slick, golden surface. In her desperation, (Y/N) dug her nails into Thanos\u2019s arm, yanking herself onto his bicep, finding purchase in the nook of the gauntlet and his flesh underneath her boots. Using her body as leverage, she heaved her bodyweight against the gauntlet to pry it off of his wrist, Tony and Peter still pulling at his fingertips.</p><p>\u00a0 Gritting her teeth, she cursed and screamed at everyone and everything, allowing her adrenaline to push her weakening body onwards as it skyrocketed through her veins. Sweat poured from her hands and forehead, making it harder to lever herself, so she stabbed an ice blade into Thanos\u2019s bicep, making him howl. Somehow through the struggle, her stinging eyes found the sky, and all she could wonder was if there was really a place beyond Death.</p><p>\u00a0 But the planet went sideways as soon as Quill\u2019s fist met with Thanos\u2019s face for the final blow that brought the madman back to reality. (Y/N)\u2019s\u00a0body rolled over itself until she was face down in the dust, not knowing if anything was worth anything any longer. In the darkness of her closed eyes, she almost felt at peace. It would be so much easier to not move, to never open her eyes again. Her body felt like it was drifting inside of a dark float tank, not sensing that she was even touching the ground any longer. And it felt good. Sensational, even. Relieving. Fuck, what sweet relief.</p><p>\u00a0 Footsteps. Heavy, thundering, earth-moving, world-shattering footsteps. Him.</p><p>\u00a0 <i>Fucking asshole.</i></p><p>\u00a0 Her eyes shot open just as he reached down towards her, rolling onto her back, she thrust her open-palmed hand at Thanos\u2019s face, but nothing happened. She stared at her hand for a moment as her heart dropped into her stomach. She was defenseless. Carving his mouth into a grimace, Thanos admired his gauntlet apathetically, allowing the Power Stone\u2019s amethyst light to pulsate around his fist. With wide eyes, (Y/N) scrambled backward, reaching for a fallen sword that vanished in an array of bubbles. With a last ditch effort, (Y/N) picked up a stone and threw it at the Mad Titan as it bounced off of his armor with a pitiful click. Thanos raised his brow at her and she shrugged.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYou make do with what you got,\u201d (Y/N) said awkwardly just as Thanos closed his fist and the feeling of being strangled lifted her feet off of the ground. She grabbed at her neck to stop the choking, but all she could grasp was air.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cOf all my years in this Universe, you are the only one who continues to surprise me. But my patience has worn out with you, child. This was your final warning.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cThought you appreciated my determination. Take that back?\u201d (Y/N) choked out as Thanos wielded his gauntlet to bring her to him, but as soon as the spell broke, she did a backflip off his chest, unsheathing a blade from her side. They both circled each other, Thanos with feigned interest, but (Y/N) had only death in her glare.\u00a0\u201cYou aren\u2019t virtuous for this, no matter how much you\u2019ve convinced yourself otherwise. That you\u2019re some kind of <i>unsung hero\u00a0</i>of the Universe. In fact, Virtue Ethics could spit on your grave, and you\u2019d fucking deserve it.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s fascinating how you become bolder the more desperate you become.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cGo flatter yourself, Dickhead. You can\u2019t break me. Make me desperate. Many men have tried, and yet I\u2019m still here.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cSo am I.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cFor how long, though? How long do you really think you can outrun his vision?\u201d (Y/N) postulated, nodding her head over to Strange who watched with his magic sigils up, prepared for the fight.\u00a0\u201cIf his vision is true, then you are so screwed.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI highly doubt it,\u201d Thanos sneered.\u00a0\u201cI have seen my destiny and reveled in my path. Besides, you will long be dead before you become a threat to me.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cBold of you to assume that I want to live,\u201d she retorted with a smirk, but she remained vigilant, her feet never ceasing in their lethal motion. \u201cWhich brings up the question of how badly do you want to live? What if the Snap takes you out with the rest of us, huh? You said the Snap brings about a balance to anyone in the Universe, no matter who they are. If that\u2019s true, then what?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI am prepared for whatever my Destiny brings\u2026even if that means my end.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 (Y/N) stopped in her tracks, looking the Mad Titan up and down, until she burst into laughter, throwing her body over a boulder to keep herself standing.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWhoa, whoa, whoa, wait a fucking minute!\u201d (Y/N) choked out through her confused tears, her body unable to hold back the outpour of her raw emotions any longer.\u00a0\u201c<i>You</i> mean to tell <i>me </i>that you\u2019re<i>\u00a0</i>completely<i>\u00a0</i>fine with the stone killing you? Not seeing the grand gratitude sweep the galaxy? See people prostrate at your, presumably, nasty-ass feet for <i>saving</i> them? You\u2019re not the slightest bit curious to <i>know</i> what the world will look like after you\u2019ve completed your mission?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 Thanos stared at her from across the plane, an absent gaze giving (Y/N) all the answers she needed as she slammed her fist against the rock.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cThen, what would have been the fucking point?!\u201d she screamed at him, enraged at his silence as she shook her head in horror.\u00a0\u201cAnswer me!\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYou have asked all of your questions, and I have constantly repeated my answer,\u201d Thanos mused.\u00a0\u201cI will not repeat myself again.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u201cYou\u2019re a robot. You have one function, and that is to murder. So, when I kill you, I will have no regrets,\u201d she threatened him, but Thanos just grinned at her. \u201cDon\u2019t look at me like that. First off, because it\u2019s disgusting. Second, I\u2019ve been underestimated before by countless bastards before, and since you claim to know me, and have\u00a0seen the things that I\u2019ve done\u2026you know exactly what happened to them. You\u2019re no different. Make me your slave, and it will be the last thing you ever do.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 Silence fell over the plane as Thanos stopped dead in his tracks, facing (Y/N) with a pernicious smile, no longer seeing her as an ally, but now as his final conquest. The wind swept up the golden dust around him that turned black as it neared him, a foreboding future twisted beneath its veil.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cDeal,\u201d Thanos declared darkly as (Y/N) charged him viciously, dodging his first few blows, but she had lost her magic. She was still a skilled fighter trained by Natasha and Steve, quick and relentless, but not nearly good enough. He snatched her up once he was finished toying with her, the Power Stone holding her captive as she was forced to stand before him in front of all her allies who watched with fearful eyes. She could feel the heat of the gauntlet pressing against her temple, but she staunched the tears that were welling up behind her eyes.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 <i>If this is my last stand, let it be so. Kill me if you have to.</i></p><p>\u00a0 Gamora\u2019s last words to (Y/N) echoed through her mind. It ricocheted off memories she\u2019d created with her team, dreams she had with her friends, and a future she would never get to live with Steve, the only man she had ever loved.</p><p>\u00a0 But in the face of the deaths of half the Universe, she embraced the end with open arms, unafraid, and fearless.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 She met Tony\u2019s eyes as his mask fell away from his distraught face, slashes of blood decorated his strong features that gave her all the motivation she needed.</p><p>\u00a0 <i>It\u2019s time</i>, was the last message she sent to him in his mind and by the shudder of his shoulders, she knew he had received it. Thanos continued his rant about underappreciation as she watched Tony\u2019s arm lift towards her, tears rolling down his cheeks as he stared into her dauntless eyes, his hesitation damning if Thanos turned away from Strange. (Y/N) lifted her chin higher as she slowed her breath, allowing the noise to fall away, focusing only on her last word. She mouthed to him, <i>now</i>.</p><p>\u00a0 Strangling against his own scream, Tony lit his thrusters and pointed his targets at her, letting them burn and burn as he contemplated. But there wasn\u2019t anything to contemplate\u2026he could never hurt any of his friends, not again. Even for this. (Y/N) may think this was the right thing to do, but Tony still had faith in Strange. Faith that he could keep the Time Stone safe long enough for his vision to come to pass.</p><p>\u00a0 Releasing his breath, he lowered his arm. But from the look on (Y/N)\u2019s face, he almost thought that he had shot her anyway. Her complexion paled so drastically, he wondered if someone<i> else</i> may have shot her. But nobody did. She really believed this was the only way.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cThis is your final warning, Wizard. No more tricks,\u201d Thanos called out, surveying his audience with thinly veiled impatience. (Y/N) struggled in his grasp, but her strength wasn\u2019t much without the stone. She refused to admit that this was the weakest point of her life. If Tony wasn\u2019t going to do something, she had to. But just as Tony lowered his arm, a ragged war cry belted from (Y/N)\u2019s left side where she turned to find Nebula with her blade thrust straight towards her heart. (Y/N)\u2019s lips parted to a relieved smile, beaming with irrational joy at the oncoming blade, accepting what it meant for the safety of everyone she loved.</p><p>\u00a0 But a burst of red magic shot the woman down. Tracing her eyes back towards Strange\u2019s smoldering hands, (Y/N) screamed in anger at him, cursing him out as she fought against Thanos\u2019s grasp, but all hope was lost when the blue, red, orange, and purple magic of the stones convulsed around her and Thanos in a forcefield that blocked any attempts of Tony\u2019s and Strange\u2019s to rescue her. She turned away from the\u00a0hex, but it was all too late as the venomous tendrils grasped at her body, lifting her into the air with the blood-curdling screams of a madwoman. The venom pierced through her skin like a million flame-licked needles that dug into every cell in her body. The searing pain threatened to melt her insides, incinerate her from the inside out. It was the most pain she had felt in her entire life. If she had desired death before\u2026</p><p>\u00a0 Her tortured screams sliced through the hearts of everyone on the desolate wasteland, her excruciating pitch growing sharper the longer the torture was endured. Even after her voice gave out, her mouth hung open in silent horror as the stones continued to bury themselves into her chest, latching onto any life source they could to thrive in their new host. This wasn\u2019t a beautiful ceremony or even a morphine-induced surgery.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 This was hell.</p><p>\u00a0 Quill and Drax watched in horror, knowing better than anyone what it felt like to have the Power Stone rip through their bodies, to have their flesh torn off in a torture that made them cower in memory. But the thought of taking on the force of all the stones made Quill hold back his vomit, not able to break his gaze from the plaguing nightmare that ruined the girl before him. Peter held onto Mantis with all the strength that he had, but he couldn\u2019t resist his body from shaking, his bones trembling from the terror of it all, praying for it just to stop, but Thanos stood tall. He watched with fascination as her body convulsed against his power, ancient eyes studying her movements with mild interest, finally allowing her to fall to the ground in a heap at his feet.</p><p>\u00a0 He leaned down to prod her, waiting for the rise and fall of her chest that eventually came. Satisfied with his work, he commanded her to rise. But she remained on the ground. Only her head lolled to the side to find Tony, betrayal condemning her bruised and bloodied features.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWhat have you done?\u201d she croaked to him, but he couldn\u2019t hear her, only read her blue-tinted lips. Everything inside of him collapsed as he steadied himself against a boulder in agony.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cStand up!\u201d Thanos commanded again, forcing the curtain of blue to fall over her eyes, but this time was different. Everything was darker. Even when she tried to speak telepathically with Tony, her voice was shut down. She could barely think straight, each thought she had was interrupted by a golden light that she realized was the Mind Stone, enticing her to find it with an insatiable rapture.</p><p>\u00a0 And she was right back to the beginning. She would\u2019ve been frustrated had she not already forgotten where she was. All she knew was that her eyes were transfixed upon Thanos who beamed down at her with such pride that she felt her lips respond accordingly, relishing in his approval as a shadow-dwelling portal opened behind him. Everything still felt wrong and confusing until she was given her final orders.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cBring me the Mind Stone,\u201d Thanos directed her. She felt her head bow lowly before him as she turned into the portal, not bothering to look back as she forgot about everyone she was leaving behind to Thanos\u2019s sadism. All she could see was gold and Thanos\u2019s prideful smile.</p><p>\u00a0 It was the only thing that she wanted. The one thing she craved.</p><p><br></p><p><b>T A G S\u00a0</b>:\u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/muXrTh8-Cv3mjVDxjEs3Ktg\">@ever-so-slightly-below-average</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mlSoQ-tzWXqmHBQjEOwnDYg\">@benedrylcumbersnatch</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYlu0CG6g0HV126mDX5EUAA\">@shannonr2003</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mR0IW7pRRTlGjpaBZzLfoVw\">@daniellajocelyn</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjfaeGdUxkUDrEfygL1CdqQ\">@iiicurlingwavesiii</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mKJ5sTXat_3jOUb9CtnlJjw\">@mysteriouslysharkbait</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mt6uzR8mKp99MC6sWbfZb_w\">@sireennotsiren</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mDkKVCSpAX6qq9iDj5NKJLw\">@pluvialday</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYUJMbc4I2mRJul-C-Rv_7w\">s</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/me4cXs-LqZjfS_X4AiYJsiQ\">@thenogravity</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mtifdrf4Wv9zh77_HIw6Rng\">@i-only-signed-up-for-fanfiction</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m9-bsWgVBrCu9UHdvGNmyKA\">@shadowalex2000</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mN9DldOxAXGIUkDC3VjZmxg\">@bubbleteaproduction</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mUxwWE4gjyaVLsK28-QE45Q\">@introvertedsin</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mD5HZ3U1t8DOK0pLeTjKskg\">@inumorph</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/miiBX34jw1Mz_9yBxwbM8FA\">@deanskitten</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mGc3YhKa0nQ6C5c50zMTXYA\">@shamvictoria11</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/myqn4ifHH58bObOtyht1FSQ\">@dawn121</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m6r_405171R2Ah3Iymkiy3Q\">@maybeimamermaid-blog</a></p><p>**Follow and like for more!

Eyes closed and legs crossed, she concentrated on the luminescent Power Stone that warmed her curled fingertips despite the cavern\u2019s icy chill that drafted through the hollow chamber like passing spirits in the night.</p><p>\u00a0 The sound of metal scraping against metal brought her astral body back to her physical form as the Power Stone settled against her chest. She felt confident in her delivery to Tony. He would make the right choice to kill her if it came down to it. He knew more than anyone what it meant to make the hard decisions when nobody else could. It was a promise.</p><p>\u00a0 Scrambling for normalcy as the heavy doors slid upwards, (Y/N) leaned back in her chair, arms folded across her chest as she traced a casual smirk across her lips to welcome back the Mad Titan. It had only been a few hours of his absence but had she really forgotten how intimidating he was? Even his taut muscles that seemed to be carved from stone by Ares as a monument to war, paled in comparison to the iron in his eyes. Their overpowering nature made it painfully easy for her to see how he had stricken fear into the hearts of so many for so long without anyone raising a fist in objection.</p><p>\u00a0 And at that moment, despite not showing it, she wished that she were an exception.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cBack so soon?\u201d (Y/N) crooned at him poisonously.\u00a0\u201cAnd to think, I was just getting used to <i>not</i> thinking about killing innocent people. What a crazy idea, huh? You should try it sometime. Really soothes the soul.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cCease your patronizing,\u201d Thanos ordered lowly as he towered before her. \u201cIt\u2019s growing tiresome. Even from you.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cThen send me back Earth and you won\u2019t have to hear it anymore,\u201d (Y/N) postulated with the cock of her head and a poised smile.</p><p>\u00a0 Thanos grinned back at her viscously, making her own simper falter.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cThere are more ways than one to make you cooperate, child,\u201d Thanos threatened as he raised his gauntlet that was exuding the familiar blue light that made (Y/N)\u2019s stomach churn in anticipation.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cSo, you\u2019re really about to do this?\u201d (Y/N) stalled, jolting upright from her chair.\u00a0\u201cWithout taking even a moment to question this, this <i>genocide</i> that you\u2019re about to commit. Question your moralities? Your judgment? You can still change your mind. Still, make the right decision here.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ve had centuries to mull over the possibilities in my head,\u201d Thanos responded. \u201cI no longer have doubts to stop me from what I must do.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cAnd that\u2019s why you killed your daughter, right? Because you thought <i>so</i> hard on it?\u201d (Y/N) pinned him as his body tensed at her words. She sneered disgustedly at him. \u201cProbably\u00a0should\u2019ve taken more time on that one.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 Thanos grimaced towards the wall beside him as he cracked his meat slab of a neck, it\u2019s sound vibrating against the titanium in a sickening crunch. Returning his attention to the defiant warrior before him, he watched the unwieldy winter storm that brewed violently behind her eyes, reminding him of how lethal she would be if only she realized her true power. But she wouldn\u2019t. Not in time, anyway.</p><p>\u00a0 His grimace became more relaxed at his realization as he raised his fist once again.\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t know which will kill you first. Your shallow pride, your recklessness\u2026or me.\u201d And with those words, the Space Stone recaptured (Y/N)\u2019s mind, it\u2019s tendrils becoming entangled with every fiber of her being, wrapping itself like a parasite around her veins.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 Thanos had to respect her, though. Despite the pain he knew that the mind control caused her (more greatly than most since the Space Stone was also lending itself to her own abilities, combining with the Orb\u2019s power), the girl never flinched. Her razor-sharp gaze never left his own until they were veiled by a curtain of sapphire blue, finally lowering with her knee to the floor in prostration.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"400\" data-orig-height=\"225\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"dimensao7:y69j3WcY_8MMUoX5mkPEQg:ZywZ8w2Eefm6p\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/724aa03150858724f9633bfdf53d417c/tumblr_ogm1pc3LjU1rnbafjo1_400.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"400\" data-orig-height=\"225\"></figure><p>\u00a0 The slight pain that shot through his own chest surprised him as he wished that her cooperation was that of her own instead of through force, wishing once again for the apprentice-like relationship that he had had with Gamora.</p><p>\u00a0 He shook away his apprehension with ease as he commanded her to stand, observing the ethereal grace of his weapon with a faint satisfaction.</p><hr><p><b>T I T A N</b></p><p>\u00a0 Strange swallowed his trepidation, wearing a mask of neutrality as he watched the growing portal of shadows part way to Thanos, the psychopath of the century. His figure was jarring to the sorcerer despite the visions he had seen, the reality of Thanos\u2019s overwhelming presence\u00a0making him shuffle slightly in his seat atop the stone staircase above the Mad Titan.</p><p>\u00a0 As the portal dissipated, Thanos\u2019s eyes surveyed the apocalyptic landscape of his once flourishing home planet. The taunting breeze shifted the dirt to make the city appear to still be smoking as if the planet had just collapsed that very morning under flames and tragedy. It laughed at him wickedly. Thanos winced in memory.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cOh, yeah. You\u2019re much more of a Thanos,\u201d Strange remarked boldly, grasping Thanos\u2019s attention from his harrowing reverie. It was at that point when Thanos began to stalk towards the sorcerer that Strange understood the depths of his own trepidation, taking in Thanos\u2019s calculated steps with observant eyes.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201c(Y/N) has already informed me of the Maw\u2019s death,\u201d Thanos mused to Strange, which twitched the corners of Strange\u2019s lips into a smirk, remembering the\u00a0well-deserved beheading on the Maw\u2019s own ship. \u201cThis day extracts a heavy toll. Still, he accomplished his mission.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYou may regret that,\u201d Strange returned with a flick of his marred eyebrow. \u201cHe brought you face-to-face with the Master of the Mystic Arts.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cAnd where do you think he brought you?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cLet me guess. Your home?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 Thanos laughed humorlessly, placing a foot atop a fallen piece of debris as he launched into Titan\u2019s tragic backstory (complete with a Reality-Stone-induced projection of the planet at it\u2019s best, how generous!).</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m a survivor,\u201d Thanos announced, almost proudly.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWho wants to murder trillions,\u201d Strange retorted.</p><p>\u00a0 \u201cWith all six stones, I could simply snap my fingers and they would all cease to exist,\u201d Thanos said.\u00a0\u201cI call that\u2026mercy.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cAnd then what?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI\u2019d finally rest and watch the sun rise on a grateful Universe,\u201d Thanos answered with a relieved sigh. He turned towards the\u00a0smog-filled skies that bared its weight upon the planet like a falling building. The atmosphere itself was claustrophobic. It made him yearn for the days of fresh air and blue skies from his youth, but he pulled himself from his desires, focusing once again on the sorcerer before him. \u201c\u2026that is, with my greatest accomplice.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 Thanos grinned as he clenched his fist to open another shadow-filled portal. Blue and grey curls of smoke poured from the Stygian dimension to allow for an even darker silhouette to approach, a figure concealed by a pitch-black hooded cloak lined in silver detailing as wickedly sharp as the ice-wielded blades at the figure\u2019s sides. Stepping from the portal, the figure lifted her hood to reveal a masked face, only her eyes and {your colored} hair visible. The wild, flyaway baby hairs were easily recognizable, but the emotionless blue tint of her eyes made Strange suck in a breath.</p><p>\u00a0 From his place above the scene on the edge of a decrepit building, Peter had to shove his hand over his mouth to keep from shouting at her. Tony had warned him that (Y/N) would be there and that she might look different, but using his suit to take a closer inspection of her eyes, he could barely recognize her. No hint of the sly, teasing smile that she almost always wore, or the strong, young, foster home girl that his aunt had taken in so many years ago. The one that helped him through his first crush\u2026and the death of his uncle. It was like looking at a wax figure of one of his childhood heroes.</p><p>\u00a0 Even Tony had to stifle his own heartache when he asked Friday to hack into Peter\u2019s viewfinder to see (Y/N) for himself. This was worse than Clint. Even worse than when Wanda had possessed Bruce. Like Peter, he couldn\u2019t see a trace of his person anywhere in the face of the girl that stood beside that shriveled up monster.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 But he couldn\u2019t say that (Y/N) hadn\u2019t warned him. Even if the hallucination he saw was all in his head, a figment of his anxiety-riddled mind, he knew this day would haunt him for the rest of his life.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cSurprised, are you?\u201d Thanos boasted at Strange, letting out a deep laugh that seemed to rumble the ground beneath him.\u00a0\u201cIt took a bit of persuading, but the Space Stone finally allowed her to see my vision at it\u2019s fullest potential. I think you\u2019ll find her much more tolerable now with the discipline she has learned in our short time together.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cThis is what you call mercy?\u201d Strange choked out, managing to not stumble over his words despite what he was seeing. His close ally that he would now have to fight somehow. Of all of his visions, this was one of the ones he desperately pleaded not to come to pass. But it was the path that had to be walked.</p><p>\u00a0 Thanos crouched beside (Y/N), brushing his thumb over her cheek to disengage the black, silken mask over her face, lingering ever so slightly on her high cheekbone as he leaned towards her just to taunt Strange who balled his fists at his side with sparks of raging red.\u00a0\u201cHe desires to witness mercy, my child,\u201d Thanos mocked, taking a glance at the sorcerer.\u00a0\u201cShow him what he wishes for.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 Immediately, (Y/N) raised her hands in front of her, palms towards the sky as blue and purple magic intertwined on her fingertips like strands of DNA. Eyes still locked on the empty space in front of her, everyone was lifted into the stifling atmosphere from their cover positions. Peter, Quill, Drax, and Mantis all hovered in mid-air before the sorceress like something out of <i>Poltergeist</i>, all trying to fight her control, but her power was relentless. Even Strange tried to break them out, but his magic bounced back and almost paralyzed him as he ducked and rolled away.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s pitiful that they think they can hide from us,\u201d (Y/N) taunted with a wicked smile that was like nothing Peter had ever seen worn by her before as she turned to Thanos.\u00a0\u201cWhat would you like me to do with them?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 Thanos looked out over his conquests with arms folded over his chest, taking in a content breath.\u00a0\u201cLet them live,\u201d he ordered, then turned to (Y/N),\u00a0\u201cfor now.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 The smug look on her face grew even darker as she moved her arms in an outward sweeping motion that catapulted Mantis and Quill to the left while Drax and Peter were thrown into an archway on the right that crumbled to ash.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 Although he looked thoroughly shellshocked, Strange stood his ground, approaching the edge of the dais with his chin held high.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cSo, what is she now? Your bodyguard?\u201d Strange barked at Thanos, giving a longing look to (Y/N), but it was like staring at the bottom of the ocean. Hauntingly dark and absolutely lifeless. But he knew she was in there. Somewhere. She had to be.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cMore of a guarantee that the stones will find their way into the right hand,\u201d Thanos answered with a fond glance at (Y/N) who stood as a sentry beside him.</p><p>\u00a0 But before Strange could respond, he heard Tony\u2019s warning just prior to witnessing the large stalactite the size of a city bus that Tony was holding come hurtling straight down towards Thanos and (Y/N), preparing to crush them like ants under a boot. Quick reflexes leant to Strange\u2019s magic being shot towards (Y/N) to move her out of the way, but she was quicker. Thrusting forward her own hand, she sent his red beam barreling back at him like a bullet which he narrowly dodged as he watched a lilac-tinted forcefield appear around Thanos and (Y/N). The moment the stalactite hit the forcefield, it shattered like sand in a kid\u2019s playground around them in a shower of golden dust that beamed in the starlight.</p><p>\u00a0 With her other hand outstretched towards the sky, (Y/N) waited for the dust to settle until she spotted the red and gold suit gleaming under her amethyst spell where he thrashed to try and escape. A fly caught in her spider\u2019s web.</p><p>\u00a0 Tony witnessed the same gruesome smile split her striking features, not prepared to experience what it felt like to be her enemy, just as she twisted her wrist that sent him soaring across the abandoned planet, slamming into the cursed donut ship that brought him there in the first place.</p><p>\u00a0 With a groan, Tony shoved a large piece of metal from the old, battered ship off of his suit, barely managing to sit upright as he shook himself off.</p><p>\u00a0 \u201cHe wants to fight dirty,\u201d Tony snarled to Friday, preparing his arsenal with deadly precision. \u201cThen, let\u2019s fight dirty.\u201d</p><hr><p>\u00a0 This was the worst. The actual fucking worst. (Y/N) would have rather spent seven more years suffering through torture after torture inside the nightmare-inducing corridors of Hydra than be where she was now. Whatever subhuman horrors they would\u2019ve had lined up for her would\u2019ve been eagerly accepted by the girl who was slamming her fists against the walls of her mind. Fist after fist, she pounded and screamed and begged for her body to break free from its bondage, but she was trapped. Borderline hopeless as she was forced to watch her torture her own friends and what seemed like allies, watching as her magic easily tossed their bodies back and forth across the dusty plane, only getting knocked back a few times when they teamed up against her.</p><p>\u00a0 She hoped they would team up against her. Rooted for them to take her the fuck out. But she could see the obvious restraint they held against her, especially Peter and Tony. She could see the immediate difference between Tony dropping literal bombshells on Thanos versus him just trying to knock (Y/N) off of her feet long enough to knock her unconscious. But she swatted him aside time and time again.</p><p>\u00a0 In a battle between her and Tony, she got him pinned to the ground, ice katana hovering over his arch reactor before his thruster knocked it from her grasp. But all she had to do was manipulate another one that drilled a hole into the dirt right next to his head that he just barely managed to dodge.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYou know, you\u2019re taking this a bit far if you\u2019re still mad about Siberia,\u201d he quipped at her, widening his eyes when only a low snarl escaped her lips. Somehow, Tony blasted her off of him, but it was a weak blow.</p><p>\u00a0 <i>The only way to stop him is to stop me</i>, (Y/N) sent out to Tony, her voice echoing in the back of his mind, but he shook it away, still believing it was just his anxiety trying to sneak up on him again (which it was, but the voice was very much real). <i>Oh, and they call me the stubborn one</i>, (Y/N) groaned in annoyance which made Tony\u2019s eyebrows furrow, but again, he denied her warnings.</p><p>\u00a0 <i>For fuck\u2019s sake! What does a girl have to do to get her best friend to kill her in order to save the Universe? </i>(Y/N) thought to herself glumly, biting back the dark laughter that was rising inside of her at the nonsensical situation Thanos had put her and the entire Universe into. If she got the chance to kill him\u2026</p><p>\u00a0 <i>WHACK.\u00a0</i></p><p>\u00a0 The crunch of bones reverberated in (Y/N)\u2019s head as her skull cracked against something hard and metallic. The pain was blinding as she crumpled to the ground, but all she could think about was how unfair it was that even when she couldn\u2019t control her body, she still had to suffer through the pain that her puppet body went through. Seriously, what the hell?</p><p>\u00a0 Her eyes focused in and out, the blue curtain fading as she blinked furiously to fight against the Space Stone, but the mind control won out over her. <i>Damn</i>. All the attack did was piss off her alter-ego that turned to face the open-mouthed ally that she guessed Tony referred to as, the \u2018Space Cowboy.\u2019 He grinned awkwardly at her as she gritted her teeth at him wickedly, the reflection of her own face in the abandoned metal ship beside her frightening (Y/N) to her core. She never knew that she could terrify herself, and yet\u2026</p><p>\u00a0 She felt her neck twitch to the side which sent the Space Cowboy on a trip through the air as he crashed to the ground, rolling over himself until his back snapped hard against a large boulder. Watching it, she could feel her own spine react violently, her ears filling in the whip-like crack that she didn\u2019t actually hear. Could only know from experience. Standing, she stalked across the blinding sands with her eyes focused on the man who still groaned in agony on in the dirt.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 From her peripheral, she caught sight of the blue-tinted alien she recognized as Nebula. The woman charged at her with a razor-sharp, electrically-charged blade that gleamed wickedly in the rays of whatever poor star had the burden of lighting this deserted hellhole. Without taking her eyes from her initial target, (Y/N)\u2019s hand struck with cobra-like precision to her left, grasping ahold of Nebula\u2019s blade with inhuman strength. Despite the crimson blood that seeped from the palm of her hand, (Y/N) turned on Nebula with such a dark expression that even the assassin was forced to gape with fear. Nebula tried to remember the feisty girl who had desperately attempted to break her out of Thanos\u2019s torture chamber with the help of her own sister, but that girl wasn\u2019t who she was facing now. She could only see the sadistic tendencies of her own father mirrored back at her from the stranger\u2019s gemstone eyes.</p><p>\u00a0 Taking advantage of Nebula\u2019s incapacitated fear, (Y/N) tore the blade from Nebula\u2019s grasp, using the hilt to backhand across the woman\u2019s face to knock her unconscious in a single devastating motion. Nebula\u2019s limp body hit the ground with a thud at (Y/N)\u2019s feet, but the sorceress continued her march towards her target with only a distant apathy and the splatter of Nebula\u2019s blood adorning her features. The blade dropped to the ground with a sharp clatter right next to Nebula\u2019s head, but the woman\u2019s body remained still.</p><p>\u00a0 (Y/N) watched with hollow, hungry eyes as the man who had attacked her attempted to stand, grasping the edges of the rock behind him like it was his last hope. And maybe it was. However, just before she reached him, Thanos\u2019s strangled groans caught her attention. She whipped her head around to the aid of her Master as he fought against Strange in a massive battle of magic versus magic. It reminded her of the Boss stage in a video game, but more vibrant and tangible than she could\u2019ve ever imagined. She could almost taste the magic as it seared the atmosphere in violent color like laser beams across the sky.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 Forgetting the pathetic human, (Y/N)\u2019s body began to lithely snake its way towards Strange, apparently planning to take him out from behind like a dirty coward. Using her magic, she maneuvered some stone fragments to form a path for her to reach the cliffside that Strange was fighting from. She couldn\u2019t help feeling like she really was in a video game, reality slipping further and further away from her as the minutes passed by and the mind control continued to drip like poison into her bloodstream.</p><p>\u00a0 Finally in position, (Y/N) raised her hand to take him out, the beam of amethyst magic convulsing against her palm to end this pitiful battle that only served as a minor inconvenience to her Master\u2019s vision. To end the life of Stephen Strange.</p><p>\u00a0 But at the last moment, her sights were blinded by a sweeping kick to the back of her head that sent her sprawling to the ground far below. The stones she upheld crashed down around her as soon as she hit the dirt, smashing her head against a piece of rock halfway down that jutted from the cliffside.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 A swinging flash of red and blue spotted her memory as she opened her eyes again and rolled to her side, pulling her index finger away from her forehead to reveal a stream of blood. With a groan, her\u00a0hand dropped to the ground like a dead fish. Through her rapid blinking into the oddly lit sky, she realized that her sight was clear. No blue film. No mind control. She was free\u2026for now. But probably not for long. Her eyes almost popped out of her head with shock, but she stifled herself when she saw Thanos from across the plane. He was still battling it out against Strange and Peter, slamming the teenager who had just knocked her out of Thanos\u2019s grasp into the dirt with the force of a semi-truck.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 She barely managed to reel herself in from protecting Peter and not blow her cover before Thanos released him. Taking a breath, (Y/N) used the small amount of power she had received from the Space Stone to disguise her eyes back into the blue tint as she stood, forcing her body to remain as rigid and robotic as possible to convey that she was still under his control, taking a moment to calm the Orb that was growing warmer by the minute around her neck as her anger took a dangerous turn. But she had to remain calm, unbothered, emotionless.</p><p>\u00a0 She continued her trek across the sands, praying for nobody to contest her until she reached Thanos\u2019s side. All she needed was to get close enough to him\u2026she just needed to get there\u2026she just needed to-</p><p>\u00a0 And there was this fucking guy. The colorful language that suddenly swarmed her head could have filled a sixty-four pack of Crayola crayons. She heard his allies call him,\u00a0\u201cDrax,\u201d which seemed\u2026fitting, as he charged at her, yelling as he went, pecs out to play, swords dancing in the sky like parade batons.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 (Y/N) couldn\u2019t help rolling her eyes as she sent him sprawling across the sky like a guy who had just gotten a rather rude awakening after he fell asleep inside of a circus cannon (weird comparison, but it paints the perfect picture).</p><p>\u00a0 Finally, she reached Thanos\u2019s side where they combined the power of their stones to break through Strange\u2019s mirror dimension shield that flipped him backward off of his cliff point that exploded into a rainfall of dust. She knew that it wasn\u2019t a deadly blow, but it would keep him down for a minute, just long enough for her to do what needed to be done.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cMy child, you continue to impress me,\u201d Thanos complimented her with a condescending tone that made her want to rip his tongue out, but she would be patient. Even when he placed his hand on her shoulder, she remained a marble statue, the perfect soldier at perfect ease.\u00a0\u201cBut what would truly impress me would be if you retrieved me the Mind <i>and </i>Time Stone. Do not fail me as\u2026.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 Thanos trailed off as Tony landed in front of him like a meteor striking the dirt, thrusters flaring at the madman with the intensity of a dragon\u2019s breath.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be a failure if she was doing the right thing,\u201d Tony quipped.\u00a0\u201cNot that you know what the right thing is, even if it hit you in the face. But let\u2019s test out that theory, anyhow\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cStark,\u201d Thanos mused hauntingly, giving Tony pause.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYou know me?\u201d He demanded.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI do,\u201d Thanos grinned. \u201cI\u2019ve watched over you and (Y/N) for quite some time now. You\u2019re not the only one cursed with knowledge.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cMy only curse is you,\u201d Tony spit as he prepared to attack, but his eyes caught a flicker of silver inconspicuously slice through the air at (Y/N)\u2019s wrist like a wisp of candlelight. At the same moment, he glimpsed a shift in her face, a warning to stay back.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0Thanos only gave a curt, cold laugh at Tony\u2019s response.\u00a0\u201cNo, I wouldn\u2019t imagine you to agree with what I am here to do. That\u2019s alright. I am not here to negotiate. Tell your\u00a0friend to hand over the stone, and no one else has to get hurt. I know you would do anything to protect those you love.\u201d Thanos bolstered, stroking the length of (Y/N)\u2019s hair with deadly precision. It set Tony\u2019s teeth on edge, but he flashed another glance at her blades and instead let out a dramatic sigh.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cAgain, have to admit. He\u2019s still not my friend. Good guy, not the best with the sense of humor. Could work on loosening up the old cloak strings, if you know what I mean. Maybe you two could start a social group together-\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cEnough!\u201d Thanos bellowed, but the moment he took his first step towards Tony, both of (Y/N)\u2019s blades sunk deep into his once impenetrable flesh, one through his chest while the other found it\u2019s mark far below the belt.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cCongratulations, you finally found your balls,\u201d (Y/N) purred at the Mad Titan as he was brought to his knees, blood frothing from his mouth through his guttural roars of pain that threatened to choke him at each breath, but (Y/N) wouldn\u2019t let up. She only leaned\u00a0in harder to press her blades deeper into his body as a daring smile lit up her clear eyes, amethyst smoke curling from her nose. Thanos couldn\u2019t take his eyes off of her. The shock that she had caught him unguarded was written in bloody ink across his disturbed features.</p><p>\u00a0 Tony was in a state of shock as well. He stared in awe at the power and control (Y/N) displayed over possibly the strongest person in the galaxy. The rapid change in events left him speechless, but (Y/N) broke him out of his stupor pretty quickly when she whipped her head towards him with eyes as intense as wildfire, preparing to reduce everything that stood in her way to ash.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cThe gauntlet, moron! Get the fucking gauntlet!\u201d She commanded him breathlessly, turning back to Thanos as she struggled to hold him down. A few moments later, Drax slid across the dust like he was sliding to home plate, \u00a0grabbing ahold of Thanos\u2019s left leg, Peter behind him with a web across the blade in Thanos\u2019s chest, while Quill dropped a weapon that held down Thanos\u2019s left arm. Strange miraculously appeared over the horizon lifted by his cape to cast a portal over Thanos\u2019s head to drop Mantis onto his oversized shoulders where she tapped his temples with her fingertips to lull him into a deep, nightmarish sleep, his hollow eyes swirling with musky smoke as his tensed muscles relaxed slightly. He was still fighting, but it was as if he were trying to run a mile through the ocean. The current always pulled him back.</p><p>\u00a0 Tony launched himself at the gauntlet, seizing the golden beacon with a desperation like he\u2019d never felt before. This was their chance. This was the moment that would change everything. This was it.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cIs he under? Don\u2019t let up!\u201d Tony encouraged Mantis.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cBe quick! He is very strong!\u201d She cried out, grappling against Thanos\u2019s brutal attempts to block her out of his mind, but she was determined to not back down. She knew who she was fighting for.</p><p>\u00a0 Tony called for Peter to help him get the gauntlet, both heaving it slowly out of place. Like insanely slowly. Like the Mariana Trench dug itself an extra ten feet in the time it took them to slide the gauntlet even an inch off of Thanos\u2019s wrist.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cSo, (Y/N),\u201d Tony said, testing to see if his hallucination was real or not, \u201cstill want me to kill you?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 (Y/N) just scoffed at him through gritted teeth.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cCall this Plan B,\u201d she challenged, not taking her burning eyes off of Thanos until she peered up at Mantis.\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re not taking any of his pain away, right?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cNo! He is still in anguish!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cGood,\u201d (Y/N) whispered as she forced her blades even deeper, feeling him struggle beneath her bloody hands. Without hesitation, she allowed herself to relish the revenge. She didn\u2019t notice Quill saunter up behind her until he spoke.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cPlan B?\u201d he scoffed, thoroughly startling (Y/N). In any other situation, a blade would\u2019ve been pulled on his ass. \u201cThis is Plan A. <i>My</i>\u00a0Plan A that, for the record, totally worked,\u201d he boasted, pointing towards Strange who rolled his eyes.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cShut up, Sideburns and go sit down if you\u2019re gonna be a prick,\u201d (Y/N) snarled at him, making the man scoff again as he cleared his throat.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s Starlord,\u201d he announced boisterously in a much deeper voice, managing to puff out his chest indignantly despite (Y/N)\u2019s glare.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cBy choice?\u201d She threw back at him, making Peter almost lose his grip on the gauntlet trying not to laugh, but Tony ordered him to stay focused.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cYes, by choice-\u201d Quill began to argue, but a low moan escaped Thanos which drew his attention instead.\u00a0\u201cHa! Not so strong now, huh\u2026where\u2019s Gamora?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 (Y/N) froze as she felt the color drain from her face. At the mention of her name, (Y/N) felt like she couldn\u2019t breathe, a cold sweat breaking out across her brow. Her chest tightened along with the grip on her blades that made her knuckles turn a deathly, skeletal white.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201c\u2026<i>my Gamora</i>,\u201d Thanos growled out.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cNo, bullshit,\u201d Quill swore just as (Y/N) finally found her voice again.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYou know Gamora?\u201d she breathed out, just barely loud enough for Quill to hear. He turned to her with wide eyes.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYeah\u2026\u201d Quill said slowly, narrowing his eyes at her.\u00a0\u201cYeah, she\u2019s my girlfriend\u2026why? Did you see her? Do you know where she is?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 Oh, it hurt. It hurt so fucking bad.</p><p>\u00a0 (Y/N)\u2019s eyes flicked towards the ground, then back at Quill.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYou know where she is, don\u2019t you? Tell me! Please!\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI\u2026I will explain everything when this is all over. Once we get the gauntlet, I will tell you-\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWhy not now? Why not\u2026no\u2026\u201d Quill gasped as he turned on Thanos, shaking his head numbly at the madman, refusing to believe what he was hearing.\u00a0\u201cNo\u2026tell me you didn\u2019t! Tell me you didn\u2019t\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 Thanos struggled to speak, either choked up by the spell that cursed him, or the images that were flashing through his mind of what he had done.</p><p>\u00a0 \u201cHe-he mourns!\u201d Mantis stammered out as (Y/N) nodded over to Strange who nodded back to her, giving her the go-ahead to release her grip on the hilts of her blades as she turned to face Quill, but Nebula spoke before (Y/N) got the chance. The woman\u2019s figure began to wilt as she spoke.</p><p>\u00a0 \u201cGamora\u2026he took her to Vormir,\u201d Nebula stated coldly, her shoulders hanging in despair at her sides as the realization hit her.\u00a0\u201cHe came back with the Soul Stone, and she didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 Quill pivoted on Thanos with sunken eyes. \u201cWhat\u2026what did you do to her?! Asshole!\u201d he shouted wildly as he charged Thanos with raised fists and blazing eyes, but (Y/N) stopped him, pushing him away from the damage he was about to do.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cDon\u2019t engage! Quill, stop! Please!\u201d (Y/N) and Tony cried at him, but he tried to attack again. (Y/N) held him this time as his tears burned her neck in droplets that slipped down her collarbone. She pulled him close as she whispered to him over his shouts for vengeance,\u00a0\u201cI know. I know what he took from you. I know\u2026he\u2019s gonna pay for what he took, and what he will take if we don\u2019t get the gauntlet from him. He <i>will </i>pay. I promise-\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cPay how?\u201d Quill suddenly whispered back, pulling away from her. \u201cDeath isn\u2019t enough for him,\u201d he choked out. It was chilling, even to (Y/N). From what she\u2019d seen of him, this guy was not a killer of any kind. Of course, she could pin this on the raging adrenaline that was coursing through his veins, the familiar rage that had burned inside of her since she found out her father had killed her mom and her sister. She could see it in his eyes, feel it in the tremble of his hands, but it was more than that. It was Gamora and everything that she meant to him. It was for all the decades of life that Thanos had stolen from them both. It was pain in it\u2019s rawest form. But more than anything, it was rational.</p><p>\u00a0 (Y/N) looked at him like she was looking into a mirror, and Quill stared back at her the same way. Pain connects people in a way that nothing else can.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re right\u2026you\u2019re absolutely fucking right,\u201d (Y/N) whispered, her breath tinged in white tendrils as if they were speaking in the middle of a cold, winter\u2019s night. \u201cDeath is too good for him.\u201d It was a silent understanding between them when (Y/N) walked away from Quill, away from everyone. Quill remained grounded, watching Thanos with impassive eyes, knowing that he would pay. The enraged, broken sorceress would ensure that he would pay. He had to.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201c(Y/N),\u201d Strange warned, his voice rising in alarm as she continued to stride from the group. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWhat I should\u2019ve done from the beginning,\u201d she answered hollowly, turning apologetically to Tony. \u201cWhat you and Bruce warned me to do.\u201d She sighed as she removed the Power Stone from around her neck, placing it cautiously on a large boulder where it gleamed wickedly like the severed eye of some mystical creature long since forgotten. It seemed to wink at her before she turned her back on the wretched thing that had brought her so much misery for so many years. It came with great power that brought her strength and confidence and the life that she came to know with her weird little family, but at what cost? What was she willing to sacrifice for her own pride? Her own protection?</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201c(Y/N), don\u2019t!\u201d Strange ordered, trying to pull away from Thanos to stop her from what he knew she was planning, but the madman lurched forward in his dream-state, only Strange regaining control of him again. \u201cYou know what I saw in my vision-\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cScrew your fucking vision!\u201d she screamed back at him, an aura of raging violet plaguing the atmosphere around her. \u201cPlaying by your rules is gonna get everyone killed. At least this is a guaranteed win.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYou can\u2019t know that! He will find another way to reach his goal! He\u2019s not going to stop just because\u2026(Y/N)! Are you listening to me?\u201d Strange scolded (Y/N), ignoring Tony\u2019s pleas to leave her alone. \u201c(Y/N)! He will find another way to-\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 (Y/N) turned her eyes on Strange, and he knew the fight was over. With one last glare at Thanos, then a softer glance towards Quill, she focused her targets on the Orb. Raising her palm, the world grew still. Graveyard still. The air was no longer stifling, it was bone-chilling. Colder than Siberia where (Y/N) spent her horror-filled days inside of Hydra. Where she was first introduced to the stone. Where some could possibly say her life went to shit for seven years. She didn\u2019t blame everything on the stone\u2026but she could blame enough.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cThen I guess he\u2019ll have to find another way,\u201d she echoed.</p><p>\u00a0 With the war cry of an avalanche, (Y/N) released all the pent-up anger she had been building up towards Thanos. Every touch of his hands, every order he had given her, every single person he had killed for a broken cause that he deserved to die for, but she deemed this worse. For him to watch everything that he had worked centuries for, destroyed planets for, murdered his own daughter for, to watch it all burn out of existence by the same power he believed would restore balance to his perfect kingdom. That was one fate far worse than death.</p><p>\u00a0 As her power dissolved under her own fingertips, (Y/N) fell to her knees, watching the remnants of the Power Stone crumble to ash that cast itself into the taunting breeze. No longer did it laugh, though. No. The Universe was silent as if holding its breath for some sign that it could continue on.</p><p>\u00a0 But nobody dared to move. Not even Tony and Peter who had frozen in fear, hands still clutching the gauntlet that remained fastened to Thanos\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u00a0 Was it over? Could it really be over?</p><p>\u00a0 (Y/N) was the first to move, her aching limbs screeching at her to stay down, but she refused to listen. She stalked towards Thanos with her chin held high, balancing an invisible, fragile thing atop her head as she walked. One foot in front of the other. She crouched before him despite the smoke that still blinded his eyes, the moans of anguish still rising from his core.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cThere\u2019s your mercy,\u201d she spit at him, waiting for a retaliation that never came. She ventured a hesitant smile that grew the longer the seconds passed by that nothing happened. She wanted to feel completely at ease, but something heavy still hung in the air. Something unspeakable.\u00a0\u201cWhat? No more death threats? No more prophecies? You still haven\u2019t read my tea leaves, Miss Cleo,\u201d she taunted with a laugh. Maybe she was crazy. Maybe she\u2019d been driven mad by the stone, but she wanted to believe that the terror was over. That she could just go home. \u201cYour Yelp page is gonna need to seek out therapy after I get ahold of it. Might even need to Life Alert that shit-\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cUm, (Y/N)\u2026\u201d Peter gasped, trying to gain her attention, but she continued her rant. Instead, Peter pointed towards the shimmering portion of the gauntlet just above Thanos\u2019s index finger, a deadly poison stirring within the halfway empty socket to restore the Power Stone. This time it was Tony who yelled at her, grabbing a fistful of her cloak at the nape of her neck like a scolded puppy to drag her over to the gauntlet, pushing her face towards the gemstone that winked back at her with a vicious grin.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 Like it knew how bad she had just fucked up.</p><p>\u00a0 She gaped, allowing the realization to dawn on her, back over her with a truck, then drag her for ten miles before she tumbled to the side of the highway like forgotten roadkill. And that\u2019s all she felt. Her decaying body swaying in the taunting breeze, resuming its laughter with roaring clarity.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 Suddenly, Thanos let out a dangerous moan\u2026as if he was on the verge of waking up. (Y/N) could see his veins bulging from his arms against his struggle with Strange and Mantis, watching with wide eyes as his own pupils began to flinch back and forth inside of his sockets, searching for a way out.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cNo, no, <i>NO</i>!\u201d (Y/N) shrieked, grasping at the gauntlet with her numbed fingers, Tony and Peter following her lead, but her hands kept slipping off of the slick, golden surface. In her desperation, (Y/N) dug her nails into Thanos\u2019s arm, yanking herself onto his bicep, finding purchase in the nook of the gauntlet and his flesh underneath her boots. Using her body as leverage, she heaved her bodyweight against the gauntlet to pry it off of his wrist, Tony and Peter still pulling at his fingertips.</p><p>\u00a0 Gritting her teeth, she cursed and screamed at everyone and everything, allowing her adrenaline to push her weakening body onwards as it skyrocketed through her veins. Sweat poured from her hands and forehead, making it harder to lever herself, so she stabbed an ice blade into Thanos\u2019s bicep, making him howl. Somehow through the struggle, her stinging eyes found the sky, and all she could wonder was if there was really a place beyond Death.</p><p>\u00a0 But the planet went sideways as soon as Quill\u2019s fist met with Thanos\u2019s face for the final blow that brought the madman back to reality. (Y/N)\u2019s\u00a0body rolled over itself until she was face down in the dust, not knowing if anything was worth anything any longer. In the darkness of her closed eyes, she almost felt at peace. It would be so much easier to not move, to never open her eyes again. Her body felt like it was drifting inside of a dark float tank, not sensing that she was even touching the ground any longer. And it felt good. Sensational, even. Relieving. Fuck, what sweet relief.</p><p>\u00a0 Footsteps. Heavy, thundering, earth-moving, world-shattering footsteps. Him.</p><p>\u00a0 <i>Fucking asshole.</i></p><p>\u00a0 Her eyes shot open just as he reached down towards her, rolling onto her back, she thrust her open-palmed hand at Thanos\u2019s face, but nothing happened. She stared at her hand for a moment as her heart dropped into her stomach. She was defenseless. Carving his mouth into a grimace, Thanos admired his gauntlet apathetically, allowing the Power Stone\u2019s amethyst light to pulsate around his fist. With wide eyes, (Y/N) scrambled backward, reaching for a fallen sword that vanished in an array of bubbles. With a last ditch effort, (Y/N) picked up a stone and threw it at the Mad Titan as it bounced off of his armor with a pitiful click. Thanos raised his brow at her and she shrugged.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYou make do with what you got,\u201d (Y/N) said awkwardly just as Thanos closed his fist and the feeling of being strangled lifted her feet off of the ground. She grabbed at her neck to stop the choking, but all she could grasp was air.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cOf all my years in this Universe, you are the only one who continues to surprise me. But my patience has worn out with you, child. This was your final warning.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cThought you appreciated my determination. Take that back?\u201d (Y/N) choked out as Thanos wielded his gauntlet to bring her to him, but as soon as the spell broke, she did a backflip off his chest, unsheathing a blade from her side. They both circled each other, Thanos with feigned interest, but (Y/N) had only death in her glare.\u00a0\u201cYou aren\u2019t virtuous for this, no matter how much you\u2019ve convinced yourself otherwise. That you\u2019re some kind of <i>unsung hero\u00a0</i>of the Universe. In fact, Virtue Ethics could spit on your grave, and you\u2019d fucking deserve it.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s fascinating how you become bolder the more desperate you become.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cGo flatter yourself, Dickhead. You can\u2019t break me. Make me desperate. Many men have tried, and yet I\u2019m still here.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cSo am I.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cFor how long, though? How long do you really think you can outrun his vision?\u201d (Y/N) postulated, nodding her head over to Strange who watched with his magic sigils up, prepared for the fight.\u00a0\u201cIf his vision is true, then you are so screwed.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI highly doubt it,\u201d Thanos sneered.\u00a0\u201cI have seen my destiny and reveled in my path. Besides, you will long be dead before you become a threat to me.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cBold of you to assume that I want to live,\u201d she retorted with a smirk, but she remained vigilant, her feet never ceasing in their lethal motion. \u201cWhich brings up the question of how badly do you want to live? What if the Snap takes you out with the rest of us, huh? You said the Snap brings about a balance to anyone in the Universe, no matter who they are. If that\u2019s true, then what?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI am prepared for whatever my Destiny brings\u2026even if that means my end.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 (Y/N) stopped in her tracks, looking the Mad Titan up and down, until she burst into laughter, throwing her body over a boulder to keep herself standing.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWhoa, whoa, whoa, wait a fucking minute!\u201d (Y/N) choked out through her confused tears, her body unable to hold back the outpour of her raw emotions any longer.\u00a0\u201c<i>You</i> mean to tell <i>me </i>that you\u2019re<i>\u00a0</i>completely<i>\u00a0</i>fine with the stone killing you? Not seeing the grand gratitude sweep the galaxy? See people prostrate at your, presumably, nasty-ass feet for <i>saving</i> them? You\u2019re not the slightest bit curious to <i>know</i> what the world will look like after you\u2019ve completed your mission?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 Thanos stared at her from across the plane, an absent gaze giving (Y/N) all the answers she needed as she slammed her fist against the rock.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cThen, what would have been the fucking point?!\u201d she screamed at him, enraged at his silence as she shook her head in horror.\u00a0\u201cAnswer me!\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYou have asked all of your questions, and I have constantly repeated my answer,\u201d Thanos mused.\u00a0\u201cI will not repeat myself again.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u201cYou\u2019re a robot. You have one function, and that is to murder. So, when I kill you, I will have no regrets,\u201d she threatened him, but Thanos just grinned at her. \u201cDon\u2019t look at me like that. First off, because it\u2019s disgusting. Second, I\u2019ve been underestimated before by countless bastards before, and since you claim to know me, and have\u00a0seen the things that I\u2019ve done\u2026you know exactly what happened to them. You\u2019re no different. Make me your slave, and it will be the last thing you ever do.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 Silence fell over the plane as Thanos stopped dead in his tracks, facing (Y/N) with a pernicious smile, no longer seeing her as an ally, but now as his final conquest. The wind swept up the golden dust around him that turned black as it neared him, a foreboding future twisted beneath its veil.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cDeal,\u201d Thanos declared darkly as (Y/N) charged him viciously, dodging his first few blows, but she had lost her magic. She was still a skilled fighter trained by Natasha and Steve, quick and relentless, but not nearly good enough. He snatched her up once he was finished toying with her, the Power Stone holding her captive as she was forced to stand before him in front of all her allies who watched with fearful eyes. She could feel the heat of the gauntlet pressing against her temple, but she staunched the tears that were welling up behind her eyes.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 <i>If this is my last stand, let it be so. Kill me if you have to.</i></p><p>\u00a0 Gamora\u2019s last words to (Y/N) echoed through her mind. It ricocheted off memories she\u2019d created with her team, dreams she had with her friends, and a future she would never get to live with Steve, the only man she had ever loved.</p><p>\u00a0 But in the face of the deaths of half the Universe, she embraced the end with open arms, unafraid, and fearless.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 She met Tony\u2019s eyes as his mask fell away from his distraught face, slashes of blood decorated his strong features that gave her all the motivation she needed.</p><p>\u00a0 <i>It\u2019s time</i>, was the last message she sent to him in his mind and by the shudder of his shoulders, she knew he had received it. Thanos continued his rant about underappreciation as she watched Tony\u2019s arm lift towards her, tears rolling down his cheeks as he stared into her dauntless eyes, his hesitation damning if Thanos turned away from Strange. (Y/N) lifted her chin higher as she slowed her breath, allowing the noise to fall away, focusing only on her last word. She mouthed to him, <i>now</i>.</p><p>\u00a0 Strangling against his own scream, Tony lit his thrusters and pointed his targets at her, letting them burn and burn as he contemplated. But there wasn\u2019t anything to contemplate\u2026he could never hurt any of his friends, not again. Even for this. (Y/N) may think this was the right thing to do, but Tony still had faith in Strange. Faith that he could keep the Time Stone safe long enough for his vision to come to pass.</p><p>\u00a0 Releasing his breath, he lowered his arm. But from the look on (Y/N)\u2019s face, he almost thought that he had shot her anyway. Her complexion paled so drastically, he wondered if someone<i> else</i> may have shot her. But nobody did. She really believed this was the only way.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cThis is your final warning, Wizard. No more tricks,\u201d Thanos called out, surveying his audience with thinly veiled impatience. (Y/N) struggled in his grasp, but her strength wasn\u2019t much without the stone. She refused to admit that this was the weakest point of her life. If Tony wasn\u2019t going to do something, she had to. But just as Tony lowered his arm, a ragged war cry belted from (Y/N)\u2019s left side where she turned to find Nebula with her blade thrust straight towards her heart. (Y/N)\u2019s lips parted to a relieved smile, beaming with irrational joy at the oncoming blade, accepting what it meant for the safety of everyone she loved.</p><p>\u00a0 But a burst of red magic shot the woman down. Tracing her eyes back towards Strange\u2019s smoldering hands, (Y/N) screamed in anger at him, cursing him out as she fought against Thanos\u2019s grasp, but all hope was lost when the blue, red, orange, and purple magic of the stones convulsed around her and Thanos in a forcefield that blocked any attempts of Tony\u2019s and Strange\u2019s to rescue her. She turned away from the\u00a0hex, but it was all too late as the venomous tendrils grasped at her body, lifting her into the air with the blood-curdling screams of a madwoman. The venom pierced through her skin like a million flame-licked needles that dug into every cell in her body. The searing pain threatened to melt her insides, incinerate her from the inside out. It was the most pain she had felt in her entire life. If she had desired death before\u2026</p><p>\u00a0 Her tortured screams sliced through the hearts of everyone on the desolate wasteland, her excruciating pitch growing sharper the longer the torture was endured. Even after her voice gave out, her mouth hung open in silent horror as the stones continued to bury themselves into her chest, latching onto any life source they could to thrive in their new host. This wasn\u2019t a beautiful ceremony or even a morphine-induced surgery.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 This was hell.</p><p>\u00a0 Quill and Drax watched in horror, knowing better than anyone what it felt like to have the Power Stone rip through their bodies, to have their flesh torn off in a torture that made them cower in memory. But the thought of taking on the force of all the stones made Quill hold back his vomit, not able to break his gaze from the plaguing nightmare that ruined the girl before him. Peter held onto Mantis with all the strength that he had, but he couldn\u2019t resist his body from shaking, his bones trembling from the terror of it all, praying for it just to stop, but Thanos stood tall. He watched with fascination as her body convulsed against his power, ancient eyes studying her movements with mild interest, finally allowing her to fall to the ground in a heap at his feet.</p><p>\u00a0 He leaned down to prod her, waiting for the rise and fall of her chest that eventually came. Satisfied with his work, he commanded her to rise. But she remained on the ground. Only her head lolled to the side to find Tony, betrayal condemning her bruised and bloodied features.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWhat have you done?\u201d she croaked to him, but he couldn\u2019t hear her, only read her blue-tinted lips. Everything inside of him collapsed as he steadied himself against a boulder in agony.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cStand up!\u201d Thanos commanded again, forcing the curtain of blue to fall over her eyes, but this time was different. Everything was darker. Even when she tried to speak telepathically with Tony, her voice was shut down. She could barely think straight, each thought she had was interrupted by a golden light that she realized was the Mind Stone, enticing her to find it with an insatiable rapture.</p><p>\u00a0 And she was right back to the beginning. She would\u2019ve been frustrated had she not already forgotten where she was. All she knew was that her eyes were transfixed upon Thanos who beamed down at her with such pride that she felt her lips respond accordingly, relishing in his approval as a shadow-dwelling portal opened behind him. Everything still felt wrong and confusing until she was given her final orders.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cBring me the Mind Stone,\u201d Thanos directed her. She felt her head bow lowly before him as she turned into the portal, not bothering to look back as she forgot about everyone she was leaving behind to Thanos\u2019s sadism. All she could see was gold and Thanos\u2019s prideful smile.</p><p>\u00a0 It was the only thing that she wanted. The one thing she craved.</p><p><br></p><p><b>T A G S\u00a0</b>:\u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/muXrTh8-Cv3mjVDxjEs3Ktg\">@ever-so-slightly-below-average</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mlSoQ-tzWXqmHBQjEOwnDYg\">@benedrylcumbersnatch</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYlu0CG6g0HV126mDX5EUAA\">@shannonr2003</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mR0IW7pRRTlGjpaBZzLfoVw\">@daniellajocelyn</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjfaeGdUxkUDrEfygL1CdqQ\">@iiicurlingwavesiii</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mKJ5sTXat_3jOUb9CtnlJjw\">@mysteriouslysharkbait</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mt6uzR8mKp99MC6sWbfZb_w\">@sireennotsiren</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mDkKVCSpAX6qq9iDj5NKJLw\">@pluvialday</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYUJMbc4I2mRJul-C-Rv_7w\">s</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/me4cXs-LqZjfS_X4AiYJsiQ\">@thenogravity</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mtifdrf4Wv9zh77_HIw6Rng\">@i-only-signed-up-for-fanfiction</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m9-bsWgVBrCu9UHdvGNmyKA\">@shadowalex2000</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mN9DldOxAXGIUkDC3VjZmxg\">@bubbleteaproduction</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mUxwWE4gjyaVLsK28-QE45Q\">@introvertedsin</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mD5HZ3U1t8DOK0pLeTjKskg\">@inumorph</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/miiBX34jw1Mz_9yBxwbM8FA\">@deanskitten</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mGc3YhKa0nQ6C5c50zMTXYA\">@shamvictoria11</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/myqn4ifHH58bObOtyht1FSQ\">@dawn121</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m6r_405171R2Ah3Iymkiy3Q\">@maybeimamermaid-blog</a></p><p>**Follow and like for more!

Is love measured by how you choose to protect someone, or by the amount of trust you have in them to let them go?</i></p><hr /><p><b>T H A N O S&nbsp;&lsquo; S &nbsp;- &nbsp;S H I P</b></p><p>&nbsp; Perched on the lonesome chair that Thanos had <i>so kindly</i> provided for her, (Y/N) was still lost in her trance, her astral projection getting her message to Tony as best she could from the confines of the torture chamber where Nebula had once been. Eyes closed and legs crossed, she concentrated on the luminescent Power Stone that warmed her curled fingertips despite the cavern&rsquo;s icy chill that drafted through the hollow chamber like passing spirits in the night.</p><p>&nbsp; The sound of metal scraping against metal brought her astral body back to her physical form as the Power Stone settled against her chest. She felt confident in her delivery to Tony. He would make the right choice to kill her if it came down to it. He knew more than anyone what it meant to make the hard decisions when nobody else could. It was a promise.</p><p>&nbsp; Scrambling for normalcy as the heavy doors slid upwards, (Y/N) leaned back in her chair, arms folded across her chest as she traced a casual smirk across her lips to welcome back the Mad Titan. It had only been a few hours of his absence but had she really forgotten how intimidating he was? Even his taut muscles that seemed to be carved from stone by Ares as a monument to war, paled in comparison to the iron in his eyes. Their overpowering nature made it painfully easy for her to see how he had stricken fear into the hearts of so many for so long without anyone raising a fist in objection.</p><p>&nbsp; And at that moment, despite not showing it, she wished that she were an exception.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Back so soon?&rdquo; (Y/N) crooned at him poisonously.&nbsp;&ldquo;And to think, I was just getting used to <i>not</i> thinking about killing innocent people. What a crazy idea, huh? You should try it sometime. Really soothes the soul.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Cease your patronizing,&rdquo; Thanos ordered lowly as he towered before her. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s growing tiresome. Even from you.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Then send me back Earth and you won&rsquo;t have to hear it anymore,&rdquo; (Y/N) postulated with the cock of her head and a poised smile.</p><p>&nbsp; Thanos grinned back at her viscously, making her own simper falter.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;There are more ways than one to make you cooperate, child,&rdquo; Thanos threatened as he raised his gauntlet that was exuding the familiar blue light that made (Y/N)&rsquo;s stomach churn in anticipation.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;So, you&rsquo;re really about to do this?&rdquo; (Y/N) stalled, jolting upright from her chair.&nbsp;&ldquo;Without taking even a moment to question this, this <i>genocide</i> that you&rsquo;re about to commit. Question your moralities? Your judgment? You can still change your mind. Still, make the right decision here.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had centuries to mull over the possibilities in my head,&rdquo; Thanos responded. &ldquo;I no longer have doubts to stop me from what I must do.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;And that&rsquo;s why you killed your daughter, right? Because you thought <i>so</i> hard on it?&rdquo; (Y/N) pinned him as his body tensed at her words. She sneered disgustedly at him. &ldquo;Probably&nbsp;should&rsquo;ve taken more time on that one.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; Thanos grimaced towards the wall beside him as he cracked his meat slab of a neck, it&rsquo;s sound vibrating against the titanium in a sickening crunch. Returning his attention to the defiant warrior before him, he watched the unwieldy winter storm that brewed violently behind her eyes, reminding him of how lethal she would be if only she realized her true power. But she wouldn&rsquo;t. Not in time, anyway.</p><p>&nbsp; His grimace became more relaxed at his realization as he raised his fist once again.&nbsp;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know which will kill you first. Your shallow pride, your recklessness&hellip;or me.&rdquo; And with those words, the Space Stone recaptured (Y/N)&rsquo;s mind, it&rsquo;s tendrils becoming entangled with every fiber of her being, wrapping itself like a parasite around her veins.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; Thanos had to respect her, though. Despite the pain he knew that the mind control caused her (more greatly than most since the Space Stone was also lending itself to her own abilities, combining with the Orb&rsquo;s power), the girl never flinched. Her razor-sharp gaze never left his own until they were veiled by a curtain of sapphire blue, finally lowering with her knee to the floor in prostration.</p><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"1\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><p>&nbsp; The slight pain that shot through his own chest surprised him as he wished that her cooperation was that of her own instead of through force, wishing once again for the apprentice-like relationship that he had had with Gamora.</p><p>&nbsp; He shook away his apprehension with ease as he commanded her to stand, observing the ethereal grace of his weapon with a faint satisfaction.</p><hr /><p><b>T I T A N</b></p><p>&nbsp; Strange swallowed his trepidation, wearing a mask of neutrality as he watched the growing portal of shadows part way to Thanos, the psychopath of the century. His figure was jarring to the sorcerer despite the visions he had seen, the reality of Thanos&rsquo;s overwhelming presence&nbsp;making him shuffle slightly in his seat atop the stone staircase above the Mad Titan.</p><p>&nbsp; As the portal dissipated, Thanos&rsquo;s eyes surveyed the apocalyptic landscape of his once flourishing home planet. The taunting breeze shifted the dirt to make the city appear to still be smoking as if the planet had just collapsed that very morning under flames and tragedy. It laughed at him wickedly. Thanos winced in memory.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Oh, yeah. You&rsquo;re much more of a Thanos,&rdquo; Strange remarked boldly, grasping Thanos&rsquo;s attention from his harrowing reverie. It was at that point when Thanos began to stalk towards the sorcerer that Strange understood the depths of his own trepidation, taking in Thanos&rsquo;s calculated steps with observant eyes.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;(Y/N) has already informed me of the Maw&rsquo;s death,&rdquo; Thanos mused to Strange, which twitched the corners of Strange&rsquo;s lips into a smirk, remembering the&nbsp;well-deserved beheading on the Maw&rsquo;s own ship. &ldquo;This day extracts a heavy toll. Still, he accomplished his mission.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You may regret that,&rdquo; Strange returned with a flick of his marred eyebrow. &ldquo;He brought you face-to-face with the Master of the Mystic Arts.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;And where do you think he brought you?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Let me guess. Your home?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; Thanos laughed humorlessly, placing a foot atop a fallen piece of debris as he launched into Titan&rsquo;s tragic backstory (complete with a Reality-Stone-induced projection of the planet at it&rsquo;s best, how generous!).</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a survivor,&rdquo; Thanos announced, almost proudly.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Who wants to murder trillions,&rdquo; Strange retorted.</p><p>&nbsp; &ldquo;With all six stones, I could simply snap my fingers and they would all cease to exist,&rdquo; Thanos said.&nbsp;&ldquo;I call that&hellip;mercy.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;And then what?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;d finally rest and watch the sun rise on a grateful Universe,&rdquo; Thanos answered with a relieved sigh. He turned towards the&nbsp;smog-filled skies that bared its weight upon the planet like a falling building. The atmosphere itself was claustrophobic. It made him yearn for the days of fresh air and blue skies from his youth, but he pulled himself from his desires, focusing once again on the sorcerer before him. &ldquo;&hellip;that is, with my greatest accomplice.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; Thanos grinned as he clenched his fist to open another shadow-filled portal. Blue and grey curls of smoke poured from the Stygian dimension to allow for an even darker silhouette to approach, a figure concealed by a pitch-black hooded cloak lined in silver detailing as wickedly sharp as the ice-wielded blades at the figure&rsquo;s sides. Stepping from the portal, the figure lifted her hood to reveal a masked face, only her eyes and {your colored} hair visible. The wild, flyaway baby hairs were easily recognizable, but the emotionless blue tint of her eyes made Strange suck in a breath.</p><p>&nbsp; From his place above the scene on the edge of a decrepit building, Peter had to shove his hand over his mouth to keep from shouting at her. Tony had warned him that (Y/N) would be there and that she might look different, but using his suit to take a closer inspection of her eyes, he could barely recognize her. No hint of the sly, teasing smile that she almost always wore, or the strong, young, foster home girl that his aunt had taken in so many years ago. The one that helped him through his first crush&hellip;and the death of his uncle. It was like looking at a wax figure of one of his childhood heroes.</p><p>&nbsp; Even Tony had to stifle his own heartache when he asked Friday to hack into Peter&rsquo;s viewfinder to see (Y/N) for himself. This was worse than Clint. Even worse than when Wanda had possessed Bruce. Like Peter, he couldn&rsquo;t see a trace of his person anywhere in the face of the girl that stood beside that shriveled up monster.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; But he couldn&rsquo;t say that (Y/N) hadn&rsquo;t warned him. Even if the hallucination he saw was all in his head, a figment of his anxiety-riddled mind, he knew this day would haunt him for the rest of his life.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Surprised, are you?&rdquo; Thanos boasted at Strange, letting out a deep laugh that seemed to rumble the ground beneath him.&nbsp;&ldquo;It took a bit of persuading, but the Space Stone finally allowed her to see my vision at it&rsquo;s fullest potential. I think you&rsquo;ll find her much more tolerable now with the discipline she has learned in our short time together.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;This is what you call mercy?&rdquo; Strange choked out, managing to not stumble over his words despite what he was seeing. His close ally that he would now have to fight somehow. Of all of his visions, this was one of the ones he desperately pleaded not to come to pass. But it was the path that had to be walked.</p><p>&nbsp; Thanos crouched beside (Y/N), brushing his thumb over her cheek to disengage the black, silken mask over her face, lingering ever so slightly on her high cheekbone as he leaned towards her just to taunt Strange who balled his fists at his side with sparks of raging red.&nbsp;&ldquo;He desires to witness mercy, my child,&rdquo; Thanos mocked, taking a glance at the sorcerer.&nbsp;&ldquo;Show him what he wishes for.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; Immediately, (Y/N) raised her hands in front of her, palms towards the sky as blue and purple magic intertwined on her fingertips like strands of DNA. Eyes still locked on the empty space in front of her, everyone was lifted into the stifling atmosphere from their cover positions. Peter, Quill, Drax, and Mantis all hovered in mid-air before the sorceress like something out of <i>Poltergeist</i>, all trying to fight her control, but her power was relentless. Even Strange tried to break them out, but his magic bounced back and almost paralyzed him as he ducked and rolled away.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s pitiful that they think they can hide from us,&rdquo; (Y/N) taunted with a wicked smile that was like nothing Peter had ever seen worn by her before as she turned to Thanos.&nbsp;&ldquo;What would you like me to do with them?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; Thanos looked out over his conquests with arms folded over his chest, taking in a content breath.&nbsp;&ldquo;Let them live,&rdquo; he ordered, then turned to (Y/N),&nbsp;&ldquo;for now.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; The smug look on her face grew even darker as she moved her arms in an outward sweeping motion that catapulted Mantis and Quill to the left while Drax and Peter were thrown into an archway on the right that crumbled to ash.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; Although he looked thoroughly shellshocked, Strange stood his ground, approaching the edge of the dais with his chin held high.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;So, what is she now? Your bodyguard?&rdquo; Strange barked at Thanos, giving a longing look to (Y/N), but it was like staring at the bottom of the ocean. Hauntingly dark and absolutely lifeless. But he knew she was in there. Somewhere. She had to be.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;More of a guarantee that the stones will find their way into the right hand,&rdquo; Thanos answered with a fond glance at (Y/N) who stood as a sentry beside him.</p><p>&nbsp; But before Strange could respond, he heard Tony&rsquo;s warning just prior to witnessing the large stalactite the size of a city bus that Tony was holding come hurtling straight down towards Thanos and (Y/N), preparing to crush them like ants under a boot. Quick reflexes leant to Strange&rsquo;s magic being shot towards (Y/N) to move her out of the way, but she was quicker. Thrusting forward her own hand, she sent his red beam barreling back at him like a bullet which he narrowly dodged as he watched a lilac-tinted forcefield appear around Thanos and (Y/N). The moment the stalactite hit the forcefield, it shattered like sand in a kid&rsquo;s playground around them in a shower of golden dust that beamed in the starlight.</p><p>&nbsp; With her other hand outstretched towards the sky, (Y/N) waited for the dust to settle until she spotted the red and gold suit gleaming under her amethyst spell where he thrashed to try and escape. A fly caught in her spider&rsquo;s web.</p><p>&nbsp; Tony witnessed the same gruesome smile split her striking features, not prepared to experience what it felt like to be her enemy, just as she twisted her wrist that sent him soaring across the abandoned planet, slamming into the cursed donut ship that brought him there in the first place.</p><p>&nbsp; With a groan, Tony shoved a large piece of metal from the old, battered ship off of his suit, barely managing to sit upright as he shook himself off.</p><p>&nbsp; &ldquo;He wants to fight dirty,&rdquo; Tony snarled to Friday, preparing his arsenal with deadly precision. &ldquo;Then, let&rsquo;s fight dirty.&rdquo;</p><hr /><p>&nbsp; This was the worst. The actual fucking worst. (Y/N) would have rather spent seven more years suffering through torture after torture inside the nightmare-inducing corridors of Hydra than be where she was now. Whatever subhuman horrors they would&rsquo;ve had lined up for her would&rsquo;ve been eagerly accepted by the girl who was slamming her fists against the walls of her mind. Fist after fist, she pounded and screamed and begged for her body to break free from its bondage, but she was trapped. Borderline hopeless as she was forced to watch her torture her own friends and what seemed like allies, watching as her magic easily tossed their bodies back and forth across the dusty plane, only getting knocked back a few times when they teamed up against her.</p><p>&nbsp; She hoped they would team up against her. Rooted for them to take her the fuck out. But she could see the obvious restraint they held against her, especially Peter and Tony. She could see the immediate difference between Tony dropping literal bombshells on Thanos versus him just trying to knock (Y/N) off of her feet long enough to knock her unconscious. But she swatted him aside time and time again.</p><p>&nbsp; In a battle between her and Tony, she got him pinned to the ground, ice katana hovering over his arch reactor before his thruster knocked it from her grasp. But all she had to do was manipulate another one that drilled a hole into the dirt right next to his head that he just barely managed to dodge.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You know, you&rsquo;re taking this a bit far if you&rsquo;re still mad about Siberia,&rdquo; he quipped at her, widening his eyes when only a low snarl escaped her lips. Somehow, Tony blasted her off of him, but it was a weak blow.</p><p>&nbsp; <i>The only way to stop him is to stop me</i>, (Y/N) sent out to Tony, her voice echoing in the back of his mind, but he shook it away, still believing it was just his anxiety trying to sneak up on him again (which it was, but the voice was very much real). <i>Oh, and they call me the stubborn one</i>, (Y/N) groaned in annoyance which made Tony&rsquo;s eyebrows furrow, but again, he denied her warnings.</p><p>&nbsp; <i>For fuck&rsquo;s sake! What does a girl have to do to get her best friend to kill her in order to save the Universe? </i>(Y/N) thought to herself glumly, biting back the dark laughter that was rising inside of her at the nonsensical situation Thanos had put her and the entire Universe into. If she got the chance to kill him&hellip;</p><p>&nbsp; <i>WHACK.&nbsp;</i></p><p>&nbsp; The crunch of bones reverberated in (Y/N)&rsquo;s head as her skull cracked against something hard and metallic. The pain was blinding as she crumpled to the ground, but all she could think about was how unfair it was that even when she couldn&rsquo;t control her body, she still had to suffer through the pain that her puppet body went through. Seriously, what the hell?</p><p>&nbsp; Her eyes focused in and out, the blue curtain fading as she blinked furiously to fight against the Space Stone, but the mind control won out over her. <i>Damn</i>. All the attack did was piss off her alter-ego that turned to face the open-mouthed ally that she guessed Tony referred to as, the &lsquo;Space Cowboy.&rsquo; He grinned awkwardly at her as she gritted her teeth at him wickedly, the reflection of her own face in the abandoned metal ship beside her frightening (Y/N) to her core. She never knew that she could terrify herself, and yet&hellip;</p><p>&nbsp; She felt her neck twitch to the side which sent the Space Cowboy on a trip through the air as he crashed to the ground, rolling over himself until his back snapped hard against a large boulder. Watching it, she could feel her own spine react violently, her ears filling in the whip-like crack that she didn&rsquo;t actually hear. Could only know from experience. Standing, she stalked across the blinding sands with her eyes focused on the man who still groaned in agony on in the dirt.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; From her peripheral, she caught sight of the blue-tinted alien she recognized as Nebula. The woman charged at her with a razor-sharp, electrically-charged blade that gleamed wickedly in the rays of whatever poor star had the burden of lighting this deserted hellhole. Without taking her eyes from her initial target, (Y/N)&rsquo;s hand struck with cobra-like precision to her left, grasping ahold of Nebula&rsquo;s blade with inhuman strength. Despite the crimson blood that seeped from the palm of her hand, (Y/N) turned on Nebula with such a dark expression that even the assassin was forced to gape with fear. Nebula tried to remember the feisty girl who had desperately attempted to break her out of Thanos&rsquo;s torture chamber with the help of her own sister, but that girl wasn&rsquo;t who she was facing now. She could only see the sadistic tendencies of her own father mirrored back at her from the stranger&rsquo;s gemstone eyes.</p><p>&nbsp; Taking advantage of Nebula&rsquo;s incapacitated fear, (Y/N) tore the blade from Nebula&rsquo;s grasp, using the hilt to backhand across the woman&rsquo;s face to knock her unconscious in a single devastating motion. Nebula&rsquo;s limp body hit the ground with a thud at (Y/N)&rsquo;s feet, but the sorceress continued her march towards her target with only a distant apathy and the splatter of Nebula&rsquo;s blood adorning her features. The blade dropped to the ground with a sharp clatter right next to Nebula&rsquo;s head, but the woman&rsquo;s body remained still.</p><p>&nbsp; (Y/N) watched with hollow, hungry eyes as the man who had attacked her attempted to stand, grasping the edges of the rock behind him like it was his last hope. And maybe it was. However, just before she reached him, Thanos&rsquo;s strangled groans caught her attention. She whipped her head around to the aid of her Master as he fought against Strange in a massive battle of magic versus magic. It reminded her of the Boss stage in a video game, but more vibrant and tangible than she could&rsquo;ve ever imagined. She could almost taste the magic as it seared the atmosphere in violent color like laser beams across the sky.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; Forgetting the pathetic human, (Y/N)&rsquo;s body began to lithely snake its way towards Strange, apparently planning to take him out from behind like a dirty coward. Using her magic, she maneuvered some stone fragments to form a path for her to reach the cliffside that Strange was fighting from. She couldn&rsquo;t help feeling like she really was in a video game, reality slipping further and further away from her as the minutes passed by and the mind control continued to drip like poison into her bloodstream.</p><p>&nbsp; Finally in position, (Y/N) raised her hand to take him out, the beam of amethyst magic convulsing against her palm to end this pitiful battle that only served as a minor inconvenience to her Master&rsquo;s vision. To end the life of Stephen Strange.</p><p>&nbsp; But at the last moment, her sights were blinded by a sweeping kick to the back of her head that sent her sprawling to the ground far below. The stones she upheld crashed down around her as soon as she hit the dirt, smashing her head against a piece of rock halfway down that jutted from the cliffside.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; A swinging flash of red and blue spotted her memory as she opened her eyes again and rolled to her side, pulling her index finger away from her forehead to reveal a stream of blood. With a groan, her&nbsp;hand dropped to the ground like a dead fish. Through her rapid blinking into the oddly lit sky, she realized that her sight was clear. No blue film. No mind control. She was free&hellip;for now. But probably not for long. Her eyes almost popped out of her head with shock, but she stifled herself when she saw Thanos from across the plane. He was still battling it out against Strange and Peter, slamming the teenager who had just knocked her out of Thanos&rsquo;s grasp into the dirt with the force of a semi-truck.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; She barely managed to reel herself in from protecting Peter and not blow her cover before Thanos released him. Taking a breath, (Y/N) used the small amount of power she had received from the Space Stone to disguise her eyes back into the blue tint as she stood, forcing her body to remain as rigid and robotic as possible to convey that she was still under his control, taking a moment to calm the Orb that was growing warmer by the minute around her neck as her anger took a dangerous turn. But she had to remain calm, unbothered, emotionless.</p><p>&nbsp; She continued her trek across the sands, praying for nobody to contest her until she reached Thanos&rsquo;s side. All she needed was to get close enough to him&hellip;she just needed to get there&hellip;she just needed to-</p><p>&nbsp; And there was this fucking guy. The colorful language that suddenly swarmed her head could have filled a sixty-four pack of Crayola crayons. She heard his allies call him,&nbsp;&ldquo;Drax,&rdquo; which seemed&hellip;fitting, as he charged at her, yelling as he went, pecs out to play, swords dancing in the sky like parade batons.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; (Y/N) couldn&rsquo;t help rolling her eyes as she sent him sprawling across the sky like a guy who had just gotten a rather rude awakening after he fell asleep inside of a circus cannon (weird comparison, but it paints the perfect picture).</p><p>&nbsp; Finally, she reached Thanos&rsquo;s side where they combined the power of their stones to break through Strange&rsquo;s mirror dimension shield that flipped him backward off of his cliff point that exploded into a rainfall of dust. She knew that it wasn&rsquo;t a deadly blow, but it would keep him down for a minute, just long enough for her to do what needed to be done.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;My child, you continue to impress me,&rdquo; Thanos complimented her with a condescending tone that made her want to rip his tongue out, but she would be patient. Even when he placed his hand on her shoulder, she remained a marble statue, the perfect soldier at perfect ease.&nbsp;&ldquo;But what would truly impress me would be if you retrieved me the Mind <i>and </i>Time Stone. Do not fail me as&hellip;.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; Thanos trailed off as Tony landed in front of him like a meteor striking the dirt, thrusters flaring at the madman with the intensity of a dragon&rsquo;s breath.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t be a failure if she was doing the right thing,&rdquo; Tony quipped.&nbsp;&ldquo;Not that you know what the right thing is, even if it hit you in the face. But let&rsquo;s test out that theory, anyhow&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Stark,&rdquo; Thanos mused hauntingly, giving Tony pause.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You know me?&rdquo; He demanded.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; Thanos grinned. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve watched over you and (Y/N) for quite some time now. You&rsquo;re not the only one cursed with knowledge.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;My only curse is you,&rdquo; Tony spit as he prepared to attack, but his eyes caught a flicker of silver inconspicuously slice through the air at (Y/N)&rsquo;s wrist like a wisp of candlelight. At the same moment, he glimpsed a shift in her face, a warning to stay back.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanos only gave a curt, cold laugh at Tony&rsquo;s response.&nbsp;&ldquo;No, I wouldn&rsquo;t imagine you to agree with what I am here to do. That&rsquo;s alright. I am not here to negotiate. Tell your&nbsp;friend to hand over the stone, and no one else has to get hurt. I know you would do anything to protect those you love.&rdquo; Thanos bolstered, stroking the length of (Y/N)&rsquo;s hair with deadly precision. It set Tony&rsquo;s teeth on edge, but he flashed another glance at her blades and instead let out a dramatic sigh.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Again, have to admit. He&rsquo;s still not my friend. Good guy, not the best with the sense of humor. Could work on loosening up the old cloak strings, if you know what I mean. Maybe you two could start a social group together-&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Enough!&rdquo; Thanos bellowed, but the moment he took his first step towards Tony, both of (Y/N)&rsquo;s blades sunk deep into his once impenetrable flesh, one through his chest while the other found it&rsquo;s mark far below the belt.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Congratulations, you finally found your balls,&rdquo; (Y/N) purred at the Mad Titan as he was brought to his knees, blood frothing from his mouth through his guttural roars of pain that threatened to choke him at each breath, but (Y/N) wouldn&rsquo;t let up. She only leaned&nbsp;in harder to press her blades deeper into his body as a daring smile lit up her clear eyes, amethyst smoke curling from her nose. Thanos couldn&rsquo;t take his eyes off of her. The shock that she had caught him unguarded was written in bloody ink across his disturbed features.</p><p>&nbsp; Tony was in a state of shock as well. He stared in awe at the power and control (Y/N) displayed over possibly the strongest person in the galaxy. The rapid change in events left him speechless, but (Y/N) broke him out of his stupor pretty quickly when she whipped her head towards him with eyes as intense as wildfire, preparing to reduce everything that stood in her way to ash.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;The gauntlet, moron! Get the fucking gauntlet!&rdquo; She commanded him breathlessly, turning back to Thanos as she struggled to hold him down. A few moments later, Drax slid across the dust like he was sliding to home plate, &nbsp;grabbing ahold of Thanos&rsquo;s left leg, Peter behind him with a web across the blade in Thanos&rsquo;s chest, while Quill dropped a weapon that held down Thanos&rsquo;s left arm. Strange miraculously appeared over the horizon lifted by his cape to cast a portal over Thanos&rsquo;s head to drop Mantis onto his oversized shoulders where she tapped his temples with her fingertips to lull him into a deep, nightmarish sleep, his hollow eyes swirling with musky smoke as his tensed muscles relaxed slightly. He was still fighting, but it was as if he were trying to run a mile through the ocean. The current always pulled him back.</p><p>&nbsp; Tony launched himself at the gauntlet, seizing the golden beacon with a desperation like he&rsquo;d never felt before. This was their chance. This was the moment that would change everything. This was it.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Is he under? Don&rsquo;t let up!&rdquo; Tony encouraged Mantis.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Be quick! He is very strong!&rdquo; She cried out, grappling against Thanos&rsquo;s brutal attempts to block her out of his mind, but she was determined to not back down. She knew who she was fighting for.</p><p>&nbsp; Tony called for Peter to help him get the gauntlet, both heaving it slowly out of place. Like insanely slowly. Like the Mariana Trench dug itself an extra ten feet in the time it took them to slide the gauntlet even an inch off of Thanos&rsquo;s wrist.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;So, (Y/N),&rdquo; Tony said, testing to see if his hallucination was real or not, &ldquo;still want me to kill you?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; (Y/N) just scoffed at him through gritted teeth.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Call this Plan B,&rdquo; she challenged, not taking her burning eyes off of Thanos until she peered up at Mantis.&nbsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not taking any of his pain away, right?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;No! He is still in anguish!&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; (Y/N) whispered as she forced her blades even deeper, feeling him struggle beneath her bloody hands. Without hesitation, she allowed herself to relish the revenge. She didn&rsquo;t notice Quill saunter up behind her until he spoke.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Plan B?&rdquo; he scoffed, thoroughly startling (Y/N). In any other situation, a blade would&rsquo;ve been pulled on his ass. &ldquo;This is Plan A. <i>My</i>&nbsp;Plan A that, for the record, totally worked,&rdquo; he boasted, pointing towards Strange who rolled his eyes.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Shut up, Sideburns and go sit down if you&rsquo;re gonna be a prick,&rdquo; (Y/N) snarled at him, making the man scoff again as he cleared his throat.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Starlord,&rdquo; he announced boisterously in a much deeper voice, managing to puff out his chest indignantly despite (Y/N)&rsquo;s glare.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;By choice?&rdquo; She threw back at him, making Peter almost lose his grip on the gauntlet trying not to laugh, but Tony ordered him to stay focused.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Yes, by choice-&rdquo; Quill began to argue, but a low moan escaped Thanos which drew his attention instead.&nbsp;&ldquo;Ha! Not so strong now, huh&hellip;where&rsquo;s Gamora?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; (Y/N) froze as she felt the color drain from her face. At the mention of her name, (Y/N) felt like she couldn&rsquo;t breathe, a cold sweat breaking out across her brow. Her chest tightened along with the grip on her blades that made her knuckles turn a deathly, skeletal white.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;&hellip;<i>my Gamora</i>,&rdquo; Thanos growled out.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;No, bullshit,&rdquo; Quill swore just as (Y/N) finally found her voice again.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You know Gamora?&rdquo; she breathed out, just barely loud enough for Quill to hear. He turned to her with wide eyes.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Yeah&hellip;&rdquo; Quill said slowly, narrowing his eyes at her.&nbsp;&ldquo;Yeah, she&rsquo;s my girlfriend&hellip;why? Did you see her? Do you know where she is?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; Oh, it hurt. It hurt so fucking bad.</p><p>&nbsp; (Y/N)&rsquo;s eyes flicked towards the ground, then back at Quill.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You know where she is, don&rsquo;t you? Tell me! Please!&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I&hellip;I will explain everything when this is all over. Once we get the gauntlet, I will tell you-&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Why not now? Why not&hellip;no&hellip;&rdquo; Quill gasped as he turned on Thanos, shaking his head numbly at the madman, refusing to believe what he was hearing.&nbsp;&ldquo;No&hellip;tell me you didn&rsquo;t! Tell me you didn&rsquo;t&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; Thanos struggled to speak, either choked up by the spell that cursed him, or the images that were flashing through his mind of what he had done.</p><p>&nbsp; &ldquo;He-he mourns!&rdquo; Mantis stammered out as (Y/N) nodded over to Strange who nodded back to her, giving her the go-ahead to release her grip on the hilts of her blades as she turned to face Quill, but Nebula spoke before (Y/N) got the chance. The woman&rsquo;s figure began to wilt as she spoke.</p><p>&nbsp; &ldquo;Gamora&hellip;he took her to Vormir,&rdquo; Nebula stated coldly, her shoulders hanging in despair at her sides as the realization hit her.&nbsp;&ldquo;He came back with the Soul Stone, and she didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; Quill pivoted on Thanos with sunken eyes. &ldquo;What&hellip;what did you do to her?! Asshole!&rdquo; he shouted wildly as he charged Thanos with raised fists and blazing eyes, but (Y/N) stopped him, pushing him away from the damage he was about to do.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t engage! Quill, stop! Please!&rdquo; (Y/N) and Tony cried at him, but he tried to attack again. (Y/N) held him this time as his tears burned her neck in droplets that slipped down her collarbone. She pulled him close as she whispered to him over his shouts for vengeance,&nbsp;&ldquo;I know. I know what he took from you. I know&hellip;he&rsquo;s gonna pay for what he took, and what he will take if we don&rsquo;t get the gauntlet from him. He <i>will </i>pay. I promise-&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Pay how?&rdquo; Quill suddenly whispered back, pulling away from her. &ldquo;Death isn&rsquo;t enough for him,&rdquo; he choked out. It was chilling, even to (Y/N). From what she&rsquo;d seen of him, this guy was not a killer of any kind. Of course, she could pin this on the raging adrenaline that was coursing through his veins, the familiar rage that had burned inside of her since she found out her father had killed her mom and her sister. She could see it in his eyes, feel it in the tremble of his hands, but it was more than that. It was Gamora and everything that she meant to him. It was for all the decades of life that Thanos had stolen from them both. It was pain in it&rsquo;s rawest form. But more than anything, it was rational.</p><p>&nbsp; (Y/N) looked at him like she was looking into a mirror, and Quill stared back at her the same way. Pain connects people in a way that nothing else can.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right&hellip;you&rsquo;re absolutely fucking right,&rdquo; (Y/N) whispered, her breath tinged in white tendrils as if they were speaking in the middle of a cold, winter&rsquo;s night. &ldquo;Death is too good for him.&rdquo; It was a silent understanding between them when (Y/N) walked away from Quill, away from everyone. Quill remained grounded, watching Thanos with impassive eyes, knowing that he would pay. The enraged, broken sorceress would ensure that he would pay. He had to.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;(Y/N),&rdquo; Strange warned, his voice rising in alarm as she continued to stride from the group. &ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;What I should&rsquo;ve done from the beginning,&rdquo; she answered hollowly, turning apologetically to Tony. &ldquo;What you and Bruce warned me to do.&rdquo; She sighed as she removed the Power Stone from around her neck, placing it cautiously on a large boulder where it gleamed wickedly like the severed eye of some mystical creature long since forgotten. It seemed to wink at her before she turned her back on the wretched thing that had brought her so much misery for so many years. It came with great power that brought her strength and confidence and the life that she came to know with her weird little family, but at what cost? What was she willing to sacrifice for her own pride? Her own protection?</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;(Y/N), don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; Strange ordered, trying to pull away from Thanos to stop her from what he knew she was planning, but the madman lurched forward in his dream-state, only Strange regaining control of him again. &ldquo;You know what I saw in my vision-&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Screw your fucking vision!&rdquo; she screamed back at him, an aura of raging violet plaguing the atmosphere around her. &ldquo;Playing by your rules is gonna get everyone killed. At least this is a guaranteed win.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t know that! He will find another way to reach his goal! He&rsquo;s not going to stop just because&hellip;(Y/N)! Are you listening to me?&rdquo; Strange scolded (Y/N), ignoring Tony&rsquo;s pleas to leave her alone. &ldquo;(Y/N)! He will find another way to-&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; (Y/N) turned her eyes on Strange, and he knew the fight was over. With one last glare at Thanos, then a softer glance towards Quill, she focused her targets on the Orb. Raising her palm, the world grew still. Graveyard still. The air was no longer stifling, it was bone-chilling. Colder than Siberia where (Y/N) spent her horror-filled days inside of Hydra. Where she was first introduced to the stone. Where some could possibly say her life went to shit for seven years. She didn&rsquo;t blame everything on the stone&hellip;but she could blame enough.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Then I guess he&rsquo;ll have to find another way,&rdquo; she echoed.</p><p>&nbsp; With the war cry of an avalanche, (Y/N) released all the pent-up anger she had been building up towards Thanos. Every touch of his hands, every order he had given her, every single person he had killed for a broken cause that he deserved to die for, but she deemed this worse. For him to watch everything that he had worked centuries for, destroyed planets for, murdered his own daughter for, to watch it all burn out of existence by the same power he believed would restore balance to his perfect kingdom. That was one fate far worse than death.</p><p>&nbsp; As her power dissolved under her own fingertips, (Y/N) fell to her knees, watching the remnants of the Power Stone crumble to ash that cast itself into the taunting breeze. No longer did it laugh, though. No. The Universe was silent as if holding its breath for some sign that it could continue on.</p><p>&nbsp; But nobody dared to move. Not even Tony and Peter who had frozen in fear, hands still clutching the gauntlet that remained fastened to Thanos&rsquo;s hand.</p><p>&nbsp; Was it over? Could it really be over?</p><p>&nbsp; (Y/N) was the first to move, her aching limbs screeching at her to stay down, but she refused to listen. She stalked towards Thanos with her chin held high, balancing an invisible, fragile thing atop her head as she walked. One foot in front of the other. She crouched before him despite the smoke that still blinded his eyes, the moans of anguish still rising from his core.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;There&rsquo;s your mercy,&rdquo; she spit at him, waiting for a retaliation that never came. She ventured a hesitant smile that grew the longer the seconds passed by that nothing happened. She wanted to feel completely at ease, but something heavy still hung in the air. Something unspeakable.&nbsp;&ldquo;What? No more death threats? No more prophecies? You still haven&rsquo;t read my tea leaves, Miss Cleo,&rdquo; she taunted with a laugh. Maybe she was crazy. Maybe she&rsquo;d been driven mad by the stone, but she wanted to believe that the terror was over. That she could just go home. &ldquo;Your Yelp page is gonna need to seek out therapy after I get ahold of it. Might even need to Life Alert that shit-&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Um, (Y/N)&hellip;&rdquo; Peter gasped, trying to gain her attention, but she continued her rant. Instead, Peter pointed towards the shimmering portion of the gauntlet just above Thanos&rsquo;s index finger, a deadly poison stirring within the halfway empty socket to restore the Power Stone. This time it was Tony who yelled at her, grabbing a fistful of her cloak at the nape of her neck like a scolded puppy to drag her over to the gauntlet, pushing her face towards the gemstone that winked back at her with a vicious grin.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; Like it knew how bad she had just fucked up.</p><p>&nbsp; She gaped, allowing the realization to dawn on her, back over her with a truck, then drag her for ten miles before she tumbled to the side of the highway like forgotten roadkill. And that&rsquo;s all she felt. Her decaying body swaying in the taunting breeze, resuming its laughter with roaring clarity.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; Suddenly, Thanos let out a dangerous moan&hellip;as if he was on the verge of waking up. (Y/N) could see his veins bulging from his arms against his struggle with Strange and Mantis, watching with wide eyes as his own pupils began to flinch back and forth inside of his sockets, searching for a way out.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;No, no, <i>NO</i>!&rdquo; (Y/N) shrieked, grasping at the gauntlet with her numbed fingers, Tony and Peter following her lead, but her hands kept slipping off of the slick, golden surface. In her desperation, (Y/N) dug her nails into Thanos&rsquo;s arm, yanking herself onto his bicep, finding purchase in the nook of the gauntlet and his flesh underneath her boots. Using her body as leverage, she heaved her bodyweight against the gauntlet to pry it off of his wrist, Tony and Peter still pulling at his fingertips.</p><p>&nbsp; Gritting her teeth, she cursed and screamed at everyone and everything, allowing her adrenaline to push her weakening body onwards as it skyrocketed through her veins. Sweat poured from her hands and forehead, making it harder to lever herself, so she stabbed an ice blade into Thanos&rsquo;s bicep, making him howl. Somehow through the struggle, her stinging eyes found the sky, and all she could wonder was if there was really a place beyond Death.</p><p>&nbsp; But the planet went sideways as soon as Quill&rsquo;s fist met with Thanos&rsquo;s face for the final blow that brought the madman back to reality. (Y/N)&rsquo;s&nbsp;body rolled over itself until she was face down in the dust, not knowing if anything was worth anything any longer. In the darkness of her closed eyes, she almost felt at peace. It would be so much easier to not move, to never open her eyes again. Her body felt like it was drifting inside of a dark float tank, not sensing that she was even touching the ground any longer. And it felt good. Sensational, even. Relieving. Fuck, what sweet relief.</p><p>&nbsp; Footsteps. Heavy, thundering, earth-moving, world-shattering footsteps. Him.</p><p>&nbsp; <i>Fucking asshole.</i></p><p>&nbsp; Her eyes shot open just as he reached down towards her, rolling onto her back, she thrust her open-palmed hand at Thanos&rsquo;s face, but nothing happened. She stared at her hand for a moment as her heart dropped into her stomach. She was defenseless. Carving his mouth into a grimace, Thanos admired his gauntlet apathetically, allowing the Power Stone&rsquo;s amethyst light to pulsate around his fist. With wide eyes, (Y/N) scrambled backward, reaching for a fallen sword that vanished in an array of bubbles. With a last ditch effort, (Y/N) picked up a stone and threw it at the Mad Titan as it bounced off of his armor with a pitiful click. Thanos raised his brow at her and she shrugged.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You make do with what you got,&rdquo; (Y/N) said awkwardly just as Thanos closed his fist and the feeling of being strangled lifted her feet off of the ground. She grabbed at her neck to stop the choking, but all she could grasp was air.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Of all my years in this Universe, you are the only one who continues to surprise me. But my patience has worn out with you, child. This was your final warning.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Thought you appreciated my determination. Take that back?&rdquo; (Y/N) choked out as Thanos wielded his gauntlet to bring her to him, but as soon as the spell broke, she did a backflip off his chest, unsheathing a blade from her side. They both circled each other, Thanos with feigned interest, but (Y/N) had only death in her glare.&nbsp;&ldquo;You aren&rsquo;t virtuous for this, no matter how much you&rsquo;ve convinced yourself otherwise. That you&rsquo;re some kind of <i>unsung hero&nbsp;</i>of the Universe. In fact, Virtue Ethics could spit on your grave, and you&rsquo;d fucking deserve it.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fascinating how you become bolder the more desperate you become.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Go flatter yourself, Dickhead. You can&rsquo;t break me. Make me desperate. Many men have tried, and yet I&rsquo;m still here.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;So am I.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;For how long, though? How long do you really think you can outrun his vision?&rdquo; (Y/N) postulated, nodding her head over to Strange who watched with his magic sigils up, prepared for the fight.&nbsp;&ldquo;If his vision is true, then you are so screwed.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I highly doubt it,&rdquo; Thanos sneered.&nbsp;&ldquo;I have seen my destiny and reveled in my path. Besides, you will long be dead before you become a threat to me.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Bold of you to assume that I want to live,&rdquo; she retorted with a smirk, but she remained vigilant, her feet never ceasing in their lethal motion. &ldquo;Which brings up the question of how badly do you want to live? What if the Snap takes you out with the rest of us, huh? You said the Snap brings about a balance to anyone in the Universe, no matter who they are. If that&rsquo;s true, then what?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I am prepared for whatever my Destiny brings&hellip;even if that means my end.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; (Y/N) stopped in her tracks, looking the Mad Titan up and down, until she burst into laughter, throwing her body over a boulder to keep herself standing.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a fucking minute!&rdquo; (Y/N) choked out through her confused tears, her body unable to hold back the outpour of her raw emotions any longer.&nbsp;&ldquo;<i>You</i> mean to tell <i>me </i>that you&rsquo;re<i>&nbsp;</i>completely<i>&nbsp;</i>fine with the stone killing you? Not seeing the grand gratitude sweep the galaxy? See people prostrate at your, presumably, nasty-ass feet for <i>saving</i> them? You&rsquo;re not the slightest bit curious to <i>know</i> what the world will look like after you&rsquo;ve completed your mission?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; Thanos stared at her from across the plane, an absent gaze giving (Y/N) all the answers she needed as she slammed her fist against the rock.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Then, what would have been the fucking point?!&rdquo; she screamed at him, enraged at his silence as she shook her head in horror.&nbsp;&ldquo;Answer me!&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You have asked all of your questions, and I have constantly repeated my answer,&rdquo; Thanos mused.&nbsp;&ldquo;I will not repeat myself again.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a robot. You have one function, and that is to murder. So, when I kill you, I will have no regrets,&rdquo; she threatened him, but Thanos just grinned at her. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t look at me like that. First off, because it&rsquo;s disgusting. Second, I&rsquo;ve been underestimated before by countless bastards before, and since you claim to know me, and have&nbsp;seen the things that I&rsquo;ve done&hellip;you know exactly what happened to them. You&rsquo;re no different. Make me your slave, and it will be the last thing you ever do.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; Silence fell over the plane as Thanos stopped dead in his tracks, facing (Y/N) with a pernicious smile, no longer seeing her as an ally, but now as his final conquest. The wind swept up the golden dust around him that turned black as it neared him, a foreboding future twisted beneath its veil.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Deal,&rdquo; Thanos declared darkly as (Y/N) charged him viciously, dodging his first few blows, but she had lost her magic. She was still a skilled fighter trained by Natasha and Steve, quick and relentless, but not nearly good enough. He snatched her up once he was finished toying with her, the Power Stone holding her captive as she was forced to stand before him in front of all her allies who watched with fearful eyes. She could feel the heat of the gauntlet pressing against her temple, but she staunched the tears that were welling up behind her eyes.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; <i>If this is my last stand, let it be so. Kill me if you have to.</i></p><p>&nbsp; Gamora&rsquo;s last words to (Y/N) echoed through her mind. It ricocheted off memories she&rsquo;d created with her team, dreams she had with her friends, and a future she would never get to live with Steve, the only man she had ever loved.</p><p>&nbsp; But in the face of the deaths of half the Universe, she embraced the end with open arms, unafraid, and fearless.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; She met Tony&rsquo;s eyes as his mask fell away from his distraught face, slashes of blood decorated his strong features that gave her all the motivation she needed.</p><p>&nbsp; <i>It&rsquo;s time</i>, was the last message she sent to him in his mind and by the shudder of his shoulders, she knew he had received it. Thanos continued his rant about underappreciation as she watched Tony&rsquo;s arm lift towards her, tears rolling down his cheeks as he stared into her dauntless eyes, his hesitation damning if Thanos turned away from Strange. (Y/N) lifted her chin higher as she slowed her breath, allowing the noise to fall away, focusing only on her last word. She mouthed to him, <i>now</i>.</p><p>&nbsp; Strangling against his own scream, Tony lit his thrusters and pointed his targets at her, letting them burn and burn as he contemplated. But there wasn&rsquo;t anything to contemplate&hellip;he could never hurt any of his friends, not again. Even for this. (Y/N) may think this was the right thing to do, but Tony still had faith in Strange. Faith that he could keep the Time Stone safe long enough for his vision to come to pass.</p><p>&nbsp; Releasing his breath, he lowered his arm. But from the look on (Y/N)&rsquo;s face, he almost thought that he had shot her anyway. Her complexion paled so drastically, he wondered if someone<i> else</i> may have shot her. But nobody did. She really believed this was the only way.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;This is your final warning, Wizard. No more tricks,&rdquo; Thanos called out, surveying his audience with thinly veiled impatience. (Y/N) struggled in his grasp, but her strength wasn&rsquo;t much without the stone. She refused to admit that this was the weakest point of her life. If Tony wasn&rsquo;t going to do something, she had to. But just as Tony lowered his arm, a ragged war cry belted from (Y/N)&rsquo;s left side where she turned to find Nebula with her blade thrust straight towards her heart. (Y/N)&rsquo;s lips parted to a relieved smile, beaming with irrational joy at the oncoming blade, accepting what it meant for the safety of everyone she loved.</p><p>&nbsp; But a burst of red magic shot the woman down. Tracing her eyes back towards Strange&rsquo;s smoldering hands, (Y/N) screamed in anger at him, cursing him out as she fought against Thanos&rsquo;s grasp, but all hope was lost when the blue, red, orange, and purple magic of the stones convulsed around her and Thanos in a forcefield that blocked any attempts of Tony&rsquo;s and Strange&rsquo;s to rescue her. She turned away from the&nbsp;hex, but it was all too late as the venomous tendrils grasped at her body, lifting her into the air with the blood-curdling screams of a madwoman. The venom pierced through her skin like a million flame-licked needles that dug into every cell in her body. The searing pain threatened to melt her insides, incinerate her from the inside out. It was the most pain she had felt in her entire life. If she had desired death before&hellip;</p><p>&nbsp; Her tortured screams sliced through the hearts of everyone on the desolate wasteland, her excruciating pitch growing sharper the longer the torture was endured. Even after her voice gave out, her mouth hung open in silent horror as the stones continued to bury themselves into her chest, latching onto any life source they could to thrive in their new host. This wasn&rsquo;t a beautiful ceremony or even a morphine-induced surgery.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; This was hell.</p><p>&nbsp; Quill and Drax watched in horror, knowing better than anyone what it felt like to have the Power Stone rip through their bodies, to have their flesh torn off in a torture that made them cower in memory. But the thought of taking on the force of all the stones made Quill hold back his vomit, not able to break his gaze from the plaguing nightmare that ruined the girl before him. Peter held onto Mantis with all the strength that he had, but he couldn&rsquo;t resist his body from shaking, his bones trembling from the terror of it all, praying for it just to stop, but Thanos stood tall. He watched with fascination as her body convulsed against his power, ancient eyes studying her movements with mild interest, finally allowing her to fall to the ground in a heap at his feet.</p><p>&nbsp; He leaned down to prod her, waiting for the rise and fall of her chest that eventually came. Satisfied with his work, he commanded her to rise. But she remained on the ground. Only her head lolled to the side to find Tony, betrayal condemning her bruised and bloodied features.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;What have you done?&rdquo; she croaked to him, but he couldn&rsquo;t hear her, only read her blue-tinted lips. Everything inside of him collapsed as he steadied himself against a boulder in agony.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Stand up!&rdquo; Thanos commanded again, forcing the curtain of blue to fall over her eyes, but this time was different. Everything was darker. Even when she tried to speak telepathically with Tony, her voice was shut down. She could barely think straight, each thought she had was interrupted by a golden light that she realized was the Mind Stone, enticing her to find it with an insatiable rapture.</p><p>&nbsp; And she was right back to the beginning. She would&rsquo;ve been frustrated had she not already forgotten where she was. All she knew was that her eyes were transfixed upon Thanos who beamed down at her with such pride that she felt her lips respond accordingly, relishing in his approval as a shadow-dwelling portal opened behind him. Everything still felt wrong and confusing until she was given her final orders.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Bring me the Mind Stone,&rdquo; Thanos directed her. She felt her head bow lowly before him as she turned into the portal, not bothering to look back as she forgot about everyone she was leaving behind to Thanos&rsquo;s sadism. All she could see was gold and Thanos&rsquo;s prideful smile.</p><p>&nbsp; It was the only thing that she wanted. The one thing she craved.</p><p><br /></p><p><b>T A G S&nbsp;</b>:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/muXrTh8-Cv3mjVDxjEs3Ktg\">@ever-so-slightly-below-average</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mlSoQ-tzWXqmHBQjEOwnDYg\">@benedrylcumbersnatch</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYlu0CG6g0HV126mDX5EUAA\">@shannonr2003</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mR0IW7pRRTlGjpaBZzLfoVw\">@daniellajocelyn</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjfaeGdUxkUDrEfygL1CdqQ\">@iiicurlingwavesiii</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mKJ5sTXat_3jOUb9CtnlJjw\">@mysteriouslysharkbait</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mt6uzR8mKp99MC6sWbfZb_w\">@sireennotsiren</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mDkKVCSpAX6qq9iDj5NKJLw\">@pluvialday</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYUJMbc4I2mRJul-C-Rv_7w\">s</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/me4cXs-LqZjfS_X4AiYJsiQ\">@thenogravity</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mtifdrf4Wv9zh77_HIw6Rng\">@i-only-signed-up-for-fanfiction</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m9-bsWgVBrCu9UHdvGNmyKA\">@shadowalex2000</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mN9DldOxAXGIUkDC3VjZmxg\">@bubbleteaproduction</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mUxwWE4gjyaVLsK28-QE45Q\">@introvertedsin</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mD5HZ3U1t8DOK0pLeTjKskg\">@inumorph</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/miiBX34jw1Mz_9yBxwbM8FA\">@deanskitten</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mGc3YhKa0nQ6C5c50zMTXYA\">@shamvictoria11</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/myqn4ifHH58bObOtyht1FSQ\">@dawn121</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m6r_405171R2Ah3Iymkiy3Q\">@maybeimamermaid-blog</a></p><p>**Follow and like for more!
