It hurts. That\u2019s all there is to say because you were tired of describing the mind-numbing sensation of having regurgitated everything out of your stomach, screamed your throat raw, and cried until it felt like your eyes would bleed. You were empty and your heart was in a jar; pickling itself in order to preserve its functioning for later.</p><p>It hurts, but you hadn\u2019t given up. You had merely tucked it away.</p><p>That is what happens after a war. Things are rebuilt but are never the same as when they were initially created, and healing is a process that is best left up to the person doing the work to describe. It is all a very strenuous and lingering process that scars over eventually, but nobody can quite say when.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do when there\u2019s no one with you anymore?\u201d</p><p>You simply blink at the man that is helping with the rebuilding. His eyes are filled with deep sorrow, like everyone that he loved wasn\u2019t brought back with the snap &ndash; and maybe not all of them were, but you had no sympathy to give him.</p><p>\u201cIs that a question you should be asking a complete stranger?\u201d</p><p>He shrugs his shoulders like it isn\u2019t that big of a deal to him or even to you. \u201cIs there anyone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course there is,\u201d you look at the half-built shell of the Avengers compound and exhale heavily. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean that they stuck around.\u201d</p><p>This was your home just like it was Natasha\u2019s, and now she wasn\u2019t even there to help occupy it. Peter, Thor, Bucky, Sam, Bru- Professor Hulk, Clint, Steve\u2026 Everyone. They all had their own lives to live elsewhere, while yours was still here. Rebuilding. Healing.</p><p>Pepper had offered the guest room at their house, providing you with an option to stay close to what you knew, but it was honestly too much to consider. Feelings of being detached wasn\u2019t something Morgan needed to be put through, the little one was young and terribly impressionable. The mannerisms, the intelligence, the <i>smile</i>\u2026 everything was too much like her father in its purest form.</p><p><i>It\u2019s what\u2019s best</i>, you thought.</p><p>&ndash;</p><p>The completion of the project hadn\u2019t taken too long, after a couple of months, and extreme help from Tony\u2019s original blueprints, the compound looked like it once did.</p><p>\u201cA group of people came by when we were finishing up the inside.\u201d The same man from before stood in front of you. The man with the melancholy look in his eyes. \u201cThey activated the tech and some voice command thingy came up \u2013 not entirely sure what they did, but they said they were friends.\u201d</p><p>The fact that people you didn\u2019t know \u2013 but probably did, there aren\u2019t that many people that could possibly get by the \u2018<i>voice command thingy</i>\u2019 without being a friendly acquaintance \u2013 had been on site was a little worrying.</p><p>You nodded, \u201cAlright, thank you for your time.\u201d</p><p>His eyes lingered on you briefly before opening his mouth to speak again. \u201cIt gets easier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes it now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEventually,\u201d He smiled. \u201cIt never really goes away, but you learn how to function again.\u201d</p><p>There was a tight twist behind your rib cage, and you took a deep breath in. Part of you thought that the feeling was your heart stirring inside of the jar, anticipating the easier parts of this misery business.</p><p>Having stepped into the common area, the first thing you noticed was the different couches and tables that sat within the room. Although the interior design wasn\u2019t the same, everything else was nothing short of nauseating nostalgia. It was a rush of memories flickering throughout the room as your eyes blurred with the images of the people that once inhabited the area.</p><p><i>\u201cListen, kid\u2014&quot;</i></p><p><i>\u201cTony, if you call me a kid one more time\u2014\u201d</i></p><p><i>There was a loud sigh from Natasha from the other side of the room, lounging on one of the sectionals. \u201cYou both are children.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cIt\u2019s how I keep my boyish good looks.\u201d Tony gave her a smile laced with cockiness before turning back to you. \u201cAs I was saying, blueberries are superior, and they are in every part of this facility for a reason.\u201d</i></p><p><i>You shook your head, \u201cNegative, raspberries are the superior berry. They\u2019re delicious in desserts and they\u2019re a great source of fiber!\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou\u2019re impossible. Have you ever heard of blueberry pancakes? Blueberry muffins?\u201d</i></p><p><i>Next to you, Cap made a noise of agreement. \u201cHe\u2019s got you there.\u201d</i></p><p><i>As soon as Steve agreed with Tony, you narrowed your eyes. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t have me, Rogers. Raspberries can be in pancakes and muffins, too!\u201d Grabbing a raspberry from your container, you threw it at Thor\u2019s head. \u201cThor, which is your favorite? Raspberries or Blueberries?\u201d</i></p><p><i> </i></p><p><i>Stark crossed his arms over his chest, but not before throwing a blueberry at Thor as well. \u201cChoose wisely, point break, and the title of Strongest Avenger may just have your name next to it.\u201d</i></p><p><i> </i></p><p><i>Banner looked up from his book, \u201cIsn\u2019t that my title?\u201d Tony shushed him loudly.</i></p><p><i> </i></p><p><i>\u201cI <b>am</b> the strongest avenger,\u201d Thor mumbled, eating both berries one at a time. He hesitated only for a moment before looking between the two of you. \u201cBlueberries.\u201d</i></p><p><i> </i></p><p><i>There was a scoff over by Nat, and Clint muttered, \u201cKiss ass,\u201d under his breath.</i></p><p><i> </i></p><p><i>\u201cI hate the both of you so much right now.\u201d You threw two raspberries in your mouth, but not before Tony leaned over and stole one from you.</i></p><p><i> </i></p><p><i>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t,\u201d his smile was wide and genuine, and impossible not to mirror it.</i></p><p>On a shaky exhale, you blinked away the memory and let your hands run over the different surfaces. Making your way to the screening room, you dug your fingertips into the material of the chairs in there.</p><p>\u201cF.R.I.D.A.Y.?\u201d you called, entirely unsure if she was even still active or if you would have to find another backup interface.</p><p>There wasn\u2019t a response back and it felt like the air had been sucked out of the room then. You fell into one of the seats, staring at the large empty screen before the silence became too much and you shut your eyes. Nothing in this facility had been built by Tony. Everything, although cosmetically similar, felt foreign and unreal. This building had once been part of Stark Industries, built a long time ago and then completely renovated by Tony to be a home for the Avengers. His friends &ndash; the friends that no longer needed a place to stay.</p><p>\u201cMy apologies,\u201d The voice startled you. \u201cBecause of the previous damage, I had to update my internal system. How can I be of assistance?\u201d</p><p>You laughed, but it came out broken. \u201cIt\u2019s no problem, F.R.I.D.A.Y., I\u2019m glad to hear your voice. I don\u2019t know if you still have the photos I downloaded last summer, but&ndash;\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, the \u2018<i>save for a rainy day</i>\u2019 file. Would you like to view them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, please.\u201d</p><p>The photos had been taken at the Stark residence last summer when you had come to visit the family of three. Photos of board games, hide and seek in the woods, kayaking on the lake, and dinner at the table were all compiled within this file you had asked F.R.I.D.A.Y. to keep for you.</p><p>A few of the pictures were blurry, taken accidentally in your haste and panic to find Morgan. She had gotten much too good at the game of hide and seek that you couldn\u2019t find her after nearly thirty minutes of seeking. In the woods, Tony and Pepper had called out for her frantically, looking in piles of leaves and behind overly large rocks, but there was no trace of her.</p><p>In the slideshow was a picture of a tree so large that you imagined it being centuries older than any super soldier alive. When you had rounded it, there in its hollowed-out center was Morgan, nestled inside with her knees up to her chest and the mask that Tony had made for Pepper.</p><p><i>\u201cMorgan!\u201d you\u2019d huffed, collapsing down to your knees in relief at the sound of her giggles.</i></p><p><i> </i></p><p><i>\u201cHold still,\u201d you said quietly, and snapped a picture of her in the helmet before taking it off and scooping her up in your arms. \u201cI found her!\u201d</i></p><p><i>Tony, having panicked earlier and far quicker than either you or Pepper, landed next to the two of you in a flurry of dirt and leaves with his Iron Man suit on.</i></p><p><i>\u201cMunchkin,\u201d his voice sounded like something akin to relieved hysterics when his mask phased off. \u201cYou scared the daylights out of me!\u201d</i></p><p><i>Pepper ran up then, out of breath but with a smile on her face even as she gently scolded her daughter. \u201cMorgan, you have to answer us when we call for you, ok?\u201d</i></p><p><i>Morgan tilted her head and made a funny face, \u201cBut then I wouldn\u2019t win.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Tony let out a startled laugh, tapping a mechanism so that his suit retracted and disappeared off him before he took Morgan from you.</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou know I love you tons, kiddo.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Pepper kissed her head and you smiled; warmth blossomed in your chest at the sight of the three of them. They were finally happy with their family complete. Tony got his second chance at the life he should\u2019ve initially led.</i></p><p><i>Morgan buried her head into Tony\u2019s neck and closed her eyes, seeming overly tired by the festivities. \u201cLove you 3000,\u201d she mumbled sleepily.</i></p><p>\u2014</p><p>\u201cMiss?\u201d F.R.I.D.A.Y.\u2019s voice was soft and inquisitive, gently pulling you out of your memories.</p><p>You\u2019d gotten lost inside of your head only to realize once coming back into focus that the slideshow of pictures had stopped. The image it had finished on was a group picture, everyone that you had ever cared about sitting and smiling around a large dining table made to accommodate the overly large family. Everyone was happy, young, and <i>alive</i>.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry F.R.I.D.A.Y., what did you ask?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is a file flagged, called: Spider-Dad. Would you like to view it?\u201d</p><p>The picture was already clear in your mind, but you had it flagged for a reason. \u201cYes, please.\u201d</p><p>In an instant, the picture was blown up on the screen in high-definition. It had been a photo you\u2019d taken some time ago of Peter and Tony, the friendly neighborhood Spider-Man had come by per Stark\u2019s request in order to help him figure out his new suit. It was a picture of Peter, mask off, deploying the suit\u2019s Spider-Legs capability, Peter had been startled and Tony had his head thrown back in laughter. It was a moment of pure unadulterated bliss, something that was rarely captured in the Avengers compound.</p><p>\u201cCan you send this to Peter?\u201d</p><p>The image shrank down as F.R.I.D.A.Y. pulled up Parker\u2019s information. \u201cHow would you like to send it?\u201d</p><p>You looked at the options presented to you. There was email, text message, mail, or even a damn hologram that would project out of whatever tech Tony had supplied him with. The last thing you needed was a picture of him in the spider suit projecting out of said <i>spider suit</i> during class or something.</p><p>\u201cText message is fine. Let him know it\u2019s from me and that he better be keeping himself out of trouble.\u201d</p><p>With a sigh, you retired to the area of the compound that held what was once your room. All your belongings had been destroyed in the fight against Thanos. The only items that were left happened to be kept at the Stark residence, but it still was only a few books, a couple articles of clothing, and old trinkets that you\u2019d long forgotten about.</p><p>Collapsing down in the much too firm desk chair, you spun yourself around in it slowly. The walls of this room had once been colored a soft grey with one of the walls a pitch black, made for writing on with chalk. Tony had poked fun at you when he\u2019d seen words and images written all over it.</p><p><i>\u201cYou have highly advanced tech at your fingertips and yet here you are, doodling on my property.\u201d He gestured wildly at the outline of the art, but despite his words there was a smile tugging at the corners of his mouth. \u201cHow old are you again?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhy?\u201d You snickered, \u201cAre you gonna ground me for writing on the walls, dad?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI could.\u201d Tony tapped at his chin, pretending to think about it. \u201cI\u2019m probably old enough to be your dad, but I prefer to be the cool, devilishly handsome uncle that teaches you minor bad habits when you stay with him during the summer.\u201d</i></p><p><i>With a roll of your eyes you returned to the sketch. \u201cYou\u2019re a handful and a half.\u201d</i></p><p><i>A short pause later, Tony spoke again. \u201cIs that a no to the familial ties, then?\u201d</i></p><p><i>There was a chance your ears had played a trick on you, but his question seemed lace with the tiniest bit of disappointment.</i></p><p><i>\u201cWell,\u201d you said, turning back around to face him. \u201cYou saved me from being trafficked, gave me a place to call home, gave me a purpose by helping the Avengers, and because of that I have the most supportive group of people in my life now.\u201d You smiled softly at him after gesturing at your framed pictures on the walls. \u201cI think we\u2019ve been family since the beginning.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 uh, that\u2019s great.\u201d After maintaining eye contact with you for a brief minute, Tony gave a sharp nod and cleared his throat. \u201cAlright! Lunch in ten, bring an iron stomach because Romanoff is doing the cooking!\u201d</i></p><p><i>He turned around swiftly to leave, but before he made it all the way out, you stopped him.</i></p><p><i>\u201cHey, Tony?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cHm?\u201d He leaned back and stuck his head in the doorway. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cThank you,\u201d you said quietly, hoping that he knew what you meant. That it was all encompassing gratitude for the life he had provided for you.</i></p><p><i>A second chance.</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou know, it\u2019s moments like these when I realize what a superhero I am.\u201d For the second time you rolled your eyes, but he winked at you and said. \u201cI\u2019d do it again in a heartbeat, kid.\u201d</i></p><p>A screen suddenly projected on one of the walls and assuming it was F.R.I.D.A.Y., you sat up straighter in the seat.</p><p>\u201cA message from Peter Parker, miss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does it say?\u201d You absently rubbed at the center of your chest having felt an uncomfortable pressure there.</p><p>\u201cIt says: <b>I miss him</b>.\u201d</p><p>Closing your eyes, you sighed. \u201cOk, thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have come across another file that requires your attention.\u201d</p><p>F.R.I.D.A.Y. didn\u2019t wait for your permission to access it, meaning that it wasn\u2019t something of yours that you\u2019d tucked away in the database.</p><p>It appeared in a flash; the image of Tony projected onto the floor of your room as a hologram.</p><p>\u201cHey there, kid. It\u2019s your cool superhero uncle here.\u201d The smile on his face was distant but fond, like he\u2019d remembered the same thing I just had once he spoke. His head turned to the wall that used to be covered in your chalk drawings and you wondered if he\u2019d recorded this in your room. \u201cYou\u2019re probably wondering if I recorded this message in your room, and the answer is yeah, I definitely did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s an invasion of privacy, you loser.\u201d Your voice cracked and you bit into your lip to force yourself not to cry. You were <i>finished</i> with the tears.</p><p>\u201cI left Pep and Morgan a message already in case I, uh\u2026 in case I don\u2019t make it, but I wanted to leave you one too. After all, both you and Peter made me realize I might not be so bad at this whole dad thing.\u201d</p><p>You stood up and the uncomfortable feeling started to grow when you got closer to him. You wanted to watch him and the way he moved, his mannerisms that you saw so vividly in his daughter \u2013 small things, like the way he spoke with his hands and when he spoke quickly to get in a witty remark, you hoped had stuck with you too.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to thank you,\u201d it felt like he had looked directly at you. \u201cYou would always tell people that I saved you, but you saved me right back, kid.\u201d He had a rectangular piece of paper in his hands that he kept fiddling with absently, the movement of his fingers catching your attention every so often. \u201cI\u2019m arrogant, conceited, narcissistic, but you\u2019re one of the people that helped me believe that I could be more. You, Peter, Morgan, Pepper, you all made me believe in more than just myself.\u201d</p><p>He stopped, looking down at the thing he held in his hand once before continuing, but this time he sighed like he was weighing certain things in his mind. \u201cThis time heist thing is a little dangerous, a little confusing, and I know you hate not being part of the action, but you gotta hold down the fort this time around. I\u2019m gonna try my damnedest to bring everyone back. Whatever it takes\u2026 or whatever other rallying mantra Cap has been spewing lately, who knows. Anyways, kid, as Morgan says,\u201d He took what was in his hand and turned it around so that the image was facing outward before he pressed it against his chest. \u201c\u2018I love you 3000\u2019.\u201d</p><p>Right before it ended, you called out to F.R.I.D.A.Y., \u201cPause the transmission!\u201d</p><p>Finally, you could see what Tony had been moving around in his hands, clear as day. It was an image of the four of you, Morgan as a newborn in Pepper\u2019s arms as Tony sits next to her on the couch in awe of his daughter, and you peering over Pepper\u2019s shoulder with a wide smile on your face. You\u2019d never seen this picture before and that feeling in your chest came back even worse than before.</p><p>\u201cF.R.I.D.A.Y., do you have the original of the picture Tony\u2019s holding?\u201d</p><p>After several seconds, F.R.I.D.A.Y. responded. \u201cYes, he has it organized in a private file titled, <i>Family</i>. Would you like for me to open it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cN-no, I\u2026 Just the one picture is fine.\u201d The picture was there on the screen of your wall while Tony stood frozen in the transmission with a resigned smile on his face. \u201cYou made the sacrifice play,\u201d you inhaled deeply, something in your chest having shattered with the force of it. \u201cAnd I\u2019m trying really hard not to hate you for it. I miss you <i>so much</i>.\u201d</p><p>The shattering was the sound of the jar that you kept everything bottled up in. The metaphorical dam had broken as the crying came back in bone rattling sobs and hiccupping as you struggled to catch your breath. Everything ached too deeply, and the overwhelming sense of loneliness began to cover you like a weighted blanket. Even in the years you had lived before you met Tony Stark, nothing that you lost had ever felt <i>this</i> dreadful.</p><p>Little arms wrapped around your legs, startling you and halting your cries. \u201cM-Morgan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t cry, mommy brought juice pops.\u201d</p><p>You let out a broken laugh as you picked her up, holding her close. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t make you sad, did I?\u201d She shook her head and you felt relief wash over you. From behind, you could hear Pepper\u2019s footsteps stop in your doorway and you turned to look at her. \u201cI probably look like a mess.\u201d</p><p>Pepper smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s a good mess.\u201d She glanced over your shoulder, noticing the still paused hologram of Tony and the blown-up picture on the wall. \u201cI\u2019m glad that he left you a message.\u201d</p><p>You sniffed, \u201cI needed it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cF.R.I.D.A.Y., end the message and if you could, have that picture printed out. I think it deserves to be framed.\u201d Pepper stepped forward and settled a gentle hand on your shoulder. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be okay.\u201d</p><p>You nodded and took a deep breath in. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be okay.\u201d</p>",

It hurts. That\u2019s all there is to say because you were tired of describing the mind-numbing sensation of having regurgitated everything out of your stomach, screamed your throat raw, and cried until it felt like your eyes would bleed. You were empty and your heart was in a jar; pickling itself in order to preserve its functioning for later.</p><p>It hurts, but you hadn\u2019t given up. You had merely tucked it away.</p><p>That is what happens after a war. Things are rebuilt but are never the same as when they were initially created, and healing is a process that is best left up to the person doing the work to describe. It is all a very strenuous and lingering process that scars over eventually, but nobody can quite say when.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do when there\u2019s no one with you anymore?\u201d</p><p>You simply blink at the man that is helping with the rebuilding. His eyes are filled with deep sorrow, like everyone that he loved wasn\u2019t brought back with the snap \u2013 and maybe not all of them were, but you had no sympathy to give him.</p><p>\u201cIs that a question you should be asking a complete stranger?\u201d</p><p>He shrugs his shoulders like it isn\u2019t that big of a deal to him or even to you. \u201cIs there anyone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course there is,\u201d you look at the half-built shell of the Avengers compound and exhale heavily. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean that they stuck around.\u201d</p><p>This was your home just like it was Natasha\u2019s, and now she wasn\u2019t even there to help occupy it. Peter, Thor, Bucky, Sam, Bru- Professor Hulk, Clint, Steve\u2026 Everyone. They all had their own lives to live elsewhere, while yours was still here. Rebuilding. Healing.</p><p>Pepper had offered the guest room at their house, providing you with an option to stay close to what you knew, but it was honestly too much to consider. Feelings of being detached wasn\u2019t something Morgan needed to be put through, the little one was young and terribly impressionable. The mannerisms, the intelligence, the <i>smile</i>\u2026 everything was too much like her father in its purest form.</p><p><i>It\u2019s what\u2019s best</i>, you thought.</p><p>\u2013</p><p>The completion of the project hadn\u2019t taken too long, after a couple of months, and extreme help from Tony\u2019s original blueprints, the compound looked like it once did.</p><p>\u201cA group of people came by when we were finishing up the inside.\u201d The same man from before stood in front of you. The man with the melancholy look in his eyes. \u201cThey activated the tech and some voice command thingy came up \u2013 not entirely sure what they did, but they said they were friends.\u201d</p><p>The fact that people you didn\u2019t know \u2013 but probably did, there aren\u2019t that many people that could possibly get by the \u2018<i>voice command thingy</i>\u2019 without being a friendly acquaintance \u2013 had been on site was a little worrying.</p><p>You nodded, \u201cAlright, thank you for your time.\u201d</p><p>His eyes lingered on you briefly before opening his mouth to speak again. \u201cIt gets easier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes it now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEventually,\u201d He smiled. \u201cIt never really goes away, but you learn how to function again.\u201d</p><p>There was a tight twist behind your rib cage, and you took a deep breath in. Part of you thought that the feeling was your heart stirring inside of the jar, anticipating the easier parts of this misery business.</p><p>Having stepped into the common area, the first thing you noticed was the different couches and tables that sat within the room. Although the interior design wasn\u2019t the same, everything else was nothing short of nauseating nostalgia. It was a rush of memories flickering throughout the room as your eyes blurred with the images of the people that once inhabited the area.</p><p><i>\u201cListen, kid\u2014\"</i></p><p><i>\u201cTony, if you call me a kid one more time\u2014\u201d</i></p><p><i>There was a loud sigh from Natasha from the other side of the room, lounging on one of the sectionals. \u201cYou both are children.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cIt\u2019s how I keep my boyish good looks.\u201d Tony gave her a smile laced with cockiness before turning back to you. \u201cAs I was saying, blueberries are superior, and they are in every part of this facility for a reason.\u201d</i></p><p><i>You shook your head, \u201cNegative, raspberries are the superior berry. They\u2019re delicious in desserts and they\u2019re a great source of fiber!\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou\u2019re impossible. Have you ever heard of blueberry pancakes? Blueberry muffins?\u201d</i></p><p><i>Next to you, Cap made a noise of agreement. \u201cHe\u2019s got you there.\u201d</i></p><p><i>As soon as Steve agreed with Tony, you narrowed your eyes. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t have me, Rogers. Raspberries can be in pancakes and muffins, too!\u201d Grabbing a raspberry from your container, you threw it at Thor\u2019s head. \u201cThor, which is your favorite? Raspberries or Blueberries?\u201d</i></p><p><i> </i></p><p><i>Stark crossed his arms over his chest, but not before throwing a blueberry at Thor as well. \u201cChoose wisely, point break, and the title of Strongest Avenger may just have your name next to it.\u201d</i></p><p><i> </i></p><p><i>Banner looked up from his book, \u201cIsn\u2019t that my title?\u201d Tony shushed him loudly.</i></p><p><i> </i></p><p><i>\u201cI <b>am</b> the strongest avenger,\u201d Thor mumbled, eating both berries one at a time. He hesitated only for a moment before looking between the two of you. \u201cBlueberries.\u201d</i></p><p><i> </i></p><p><i>There was a scoff over by Nat, and Clint muttered, \u201cKiss ass,\u201d under his breath.</i></p><p><i> </i></p><p><i>\u201cI hate the both of you so much right now.\u201d You threw two raspberries in your mouth, but not before Tony leaned over and stole one from you.</i></p><p><i> </i></p><p><i>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t,\u201d his smile was wide and genuine, and impossible not to mirror it.</i></p><p>On a shaky exhale, you blinked away the memory and let your hands run over the different surfaces. Making your way to the screening room, you dug your fingertips into the material of the chairs in there.</p><p>\u201cF.R.I.D.A.Y.?\u201d you called, entirely unsure if she was even still active or if you would have to find another backup interface.</p><p>There wasn\u2019t a response back and it felt like the air had been sucked out of the room then. You fell into one of the seats, staring at the large empty screen before the silence became too much and you shut your eyes. Nothing in this facility had been built by Tony. Everything, although cosmetically similar, felt foreign and unreal. This building had once been part of Stark Industries, built a long time ago and then completely renovated by Tony to be a home for the Avengers. His friends \u2013 the friends that no longer needed a place to stay.</p><p>\u201cMy apologies,\u201d The voice startled you. \u201cBecause of the previous damage, I had to update my internal system. How can I be of assistance?\u201d</p><p>You laughed, but it came out broken. \u201cIt\u2019s no problem, F.R.I.D.A.Y., I\u2019m glad to hear your voice. I don\u2019t know if you still have the photos I downloaded last summer, but\u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, the \u2018<i>save for a rainy day</i>\u2019 file. Would you like to view them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, please.\u201d</p><p>The photos had been taken at the Stark residence last summer when you had come to visit the family of three. Photos of board games, hide and seek in the woods, kayaking on the lake, and dinner at the table were all compiled within this file you had asked F.R.I.D.A.Y. to keep for you.</p><p>A few of the pictures were blurry, taken accidentally in your haste and panic to find Morgan. She had gotten much too good at the game of hide and seek that you couldn\u2019t find her after nearly thirty minutes of seeking. In the woods, Tony and Pepper had called out for her frantically, looking in piles of leaves and behind overly large rocks, but there was no trace of her.</p><p>In the slideshow was a picture of a tree so large that you imagined it being centuries older than any super soldier alive. When you had rounded it, there in its hollowed-out center was Morgan, nestled inside with her knees up to her chest and the mask that Tony had made for Pepper.</p><p><i>\u201cMorgan!\u201d you\u2019d huffed, collapsing down to your knees in relief at the sound of her giggles.</i></p><p><i> </i></p><p><i>\u201cHold still,\u201d you said quietly, and snapped a picture of her in the helmet before taking it off and scooping her up in your arms. \u201cI found her!\u201d</i></p><p><i>Tony, having panicked earlier and far quicker than either you or Pepper, landed next to the two of you in a flurry of dirt and leaves with his Iron Man suit on.</i></p><p><i>\u201cMunchkin,\u201d his voice sounded like something akin to relieved hysterics when his mask phased off. \u201cYou scared the daylights out of me!\u201d</i></p><p><i>Pepper ran up then, out of breath but with a smile on her face even as she gently scolded her daughter. \u201cMorgan, you have to answer us when we call for you, ok?\u201d</i></p><p><i>Morgan tilted her head and made a funny face, \u201cBut then I wouldn\u2019t win.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Tony let out a startled laugh, tapping a mechanism so that his suit retracted and disappeared off him before he took Morgan from you.</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou know I love you tons, kiddo.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Pepper kissed her head and you smiled; warmth blossomed in your chest at the sight of the three of them. They were finally happy with their family complete. Tony got his second chance at the life he should\u2019ve initially led.</i></p><p><i>Morgan buried her head into Tony\u2019s neck and closed her eyes, seeming overly tired by the festivities. \u201cLove you 3000,\u201d she mumbled sleepily.</i></p><p>\u2014</p><p>\u201cMiss?\u201d F.R.I.D.A.Y.\u2019s voice was soft and inquisitive, gently pulling you out of your memories.</p><p>You\u2019d gotten lost inside of your head only to realize once coming back into focus that the slideshow of pictures had stopped. The image it had finished on was a group picture, everyone that you had ever cared about sitting and smiling around a large dining table made to accommodate the overly large family. Everyone was happy, young, and <i>alive</i>.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry F.R.I.D.A.Y., what did you ask?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is a file flagged, called: Spider-Dad. Would you like to view it?\u201d</p><p>The picture was already clear in your mind, but you had it flagged for a reason. \u201cYes, please.\u201d</p><p>In an instant, the picture was blown up on the screen in high-definition. It had been a photo you\u2019d taken some time ago of Peter and Tony, the friendly neighborhood Spider-Man had come by per Stark\u2019s request in order to help him figure out his new suit. It was a picture of Peter, mask off, deploying the suit\u2019s Spider-Legs capability, Peter had been startled and Tony had his head thrown back in laughter. It was a moment of pure unadulterated bliss, something that was rarely captured in the Avengers compound.</p><p>\u201cCan you send this to Peter?\u201d</p><p>The image shrank down as F.R.I.D.A.Y. pulled up Parker\u2019s information. \u201cHow would you like to send it?\u201d</p><p>You looked at the options presented to you. There was email, text message, mail, or even a damn hologram that would project out of whatever tech Tony had supplied him with. The last thing you needed was a picture of him in the spider suit projecting out of said <i>spider suit</i> during class or something.</p><p>\u201cText message is fine. Let him know it\u2019s from me and that he better be keeping himself out of trouble.\u201d</p><p>With a sigh, you retired to the area of the compound that held what was once your room. All your belongings had been destroyed in the fight against Thanos. The only items that were left happened to be kept at the Stark residence, but it still was only a few books, a couple articles of clothing, and old trinkets that you\u2019d long forgotten about.</p><p>Collapsing down in the much too firm desk chair, you spun yourself around in it slowly. The walls of this room had once been colored a soft grey with one of the walls a pitch black, made for writing on with chalk. Tony had poked fun at you when he\u2019d seen words and images written all over it.</p><p><i>\u201cYou have highly advanced tech at your fingertips and yet here you are, doodling on my property.\u201d He gestured wildly at the outline of the art, but despite his words there was a smile tugging at the corners of his mouth. \u201cHow old are you again?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhy?\u201d You snickered, \u201cAre you gonna ground me for writing on the walls, dad?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI could.\u201d Tony tapped at his chin, pretending to think about it. \u201cI\u2019m probably old enough to be your dad, but I prefer to be the cool, devilishly handsome uncle that teaches you minor bad habits when you stay with him during the summer.\u201d</i></p><p><i>With a roll of your eyes you returned to the sketch. \u201cYou\u2019re a handful and a half.\u201d</i></p><p><i>A short pause later, Tony spoke again. \u201cIs that a no to the familial ties, then?\u201d</i></p><p><i>There was a chance your ears had played a trick on you, but his question seemed lace with the tiniest bit of disappointment.</i></p><p><i>\u201cWell,\u201d you said, turning back around to face him. \u201cYou saved me from being trafficked, gave me a place to call home, gave me a purpose by helping the Avengers, and because of that I have the most supportive group of people in my life now.\u201d You smiled softly at him after gesturing at your framed pictures on the walls. \u201cI think we\u2019ve been family since the beginning.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 uh, that\u2019s great.\u201d After maintaining eye contact with you for a brief minute, Tony gave a sharp nod and cleared his throat. \u201cAlright! Lunch in ten, bring an iron stomach because Romanoff is doing the cooking!\u201d</i></p><p><i>He turned around swiftly to leave, but before he made it all the way out, you stopped him.</i></p><p><i>\u201cHey, Tony?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cHm?\u201d He leaned back and stuck his head in the doorway. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cThank you,\u201d you said quietly, hoping that he knew what you meant. That it was all encompassing gratitude for the life he had provided for you.</i></p><p><i>A second chance.</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou know, it\u2019s moments like these when I realize what a superhero I am.\u201d For the second time you rolled your eyes, but he winked at you and said. \u201cI\u2019d do it again in a heartbeat, kid.\u201d</i></p><p>A screen suddenly projected on one of the walls and assuming it was F.R.I.D.A.Y., you sat up straighter in the seat.</p><p>\u201cA message from Peter Parker, miss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does it say?\u201d You absently rubbed at the center of your chest having felt an uncomfortable pressure there.</p><p>\u201cIt says: <b>I miss him</b>.\u201d</p><p>Closing your eyes, you sighed. \u201cOk, thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have come across another file that requires your attention.\u201d</p><p>F.R.I.D.A.Y. didn\u2019t wait for your permission to access it, meaning that it wasn\u2019t something of yours that you\u2019d tucked away in the database.</p><p>It appeared in a flash; the image of Tony projected onto the floor of your room as a hologram.</p><p>\u201cHey there, kid. It\u2019s your cool superhero uncle here.\u201d The smile on his face was distant but fond, like he\u2019d remembered the same thing I just had once he spoke. His head turned to the wall that used to be covered in your chalk drawings and you wondered if he\u2019d recorded this in your room. \u201cYou\u2019re probably wondering if I recorded this message in your room, and the answer is yeah, I definitely did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s an invasion of privacy, you loser.\u201d Your voice cracked and you bit into your lip to force yourself not to cry. You were <i>finished</i> with the tears.</p><p>\u201cI left Pep and Morgan a message already in case I, uh\u2026 in case I don\u2019t make it, but I wanted to leave you one too. After all, both you and Peter made me realize I might not be so bad at this whole dad thing.\u201d</p><p>You stood up and the uncomfortable feeling started to grow when you got closer to him. You wanted to watch him and the way he moved, his mannerisms that you saw so vividly in his daughter \u2013 small things, like the way he spoke with his hands and when he spoke quickly to get in a witty remark, you hoped had stuck with you too.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to thank you,\u201d it felt like he had looked directly at you. \u201cYou would always tell people that I saved you, but you saved me right back, kid.\u201d He had a rectangular piece of paper in his hands that he kept fiddling with absently, the movement of his fingers catching your attention every so often. \u201cI\u2019m arrogant, conceited, narcissistic, but you\u2019re one of the people that helped me believe that I could be more. You, Peter, Morgan, Pepper, you all made me believe in more than just myself.\u201d</p><p>He stopped, looking down at the thing he held in his hand once before continuing, but this time he sighed like he was weighing certain things in his mind. \u201cThis time heist thing is a little dangerous, a little confusing, and I know you hate not being part of the action, but you gotta hold down the fort this time around. I\u2019m gonna try my damnedest to bring everyone back. Whatever it takes\u2026 or whatever other rallying mantra Cap has been spewing lately, who knows. Anyways, kid, as Morgan says,\u201d He took what was in his hand and turned it around so that the image was facing outward before he pressed it against his chest. \u201c\u2018I love you 3000\u2019.\u201d</p><p>Right before it ended, you called out to F.R.I.D.A.Y., \u201cPause the transmission!\u201d</p><p>Finally, you could see what Tony had been moving around in his hands, clear as day. It was an image of the four of you, Morgan as a newborn in Pepper\u2019s arms as Tony sits next to her on the couch in awe of his daughter, and you peering over Pepper\u2019s shoulder with a wide smile on your face. You\u2019d never seen this picture before and that feeling in your chest came back even worse than before.</p><p>\u201cF.R.I.D.A.Y., do you have the original of the picture Tony\u2019s holding?\u201d</p><p>After several seconds, F.R.I.D.A.Y. responded. \u201cYes, he has it organized in a private file titled, <i>Family</i>. Would you like for me to open it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cN-no, I\u2026 Just the one picture is fine.\u201d The picture was there on the screen of your wall while Tony stood frozen in the transmission with a resigned smile on his face. \u201cYou made the sacrifice play,\u201d you inhaled deeply, something in your chest having shattered with the force of it. \u201cAnd I\u2019m trying really hard not to hate you for it. I miss you <i>so much</i>.\u201d</p><p>The shattering was the sound of the jar that you kept everything bottled up in. The metaphorical dam had broken as the crying came back in bone rattling sobs and hiccupping as you struggled to catch your breath. Everything ached too deeply, and the overwhelming sense of loneliness began to cover you like a weighted blanket. Even in the years you had lived before you met Tony Stark, nothing that you lost had ever felt <i>this</i> dreadful.</p><p>Little arms wrapped around your legs, startling you and halting your cries. \u201cM-Morgan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t cry, mommy brought juice pops.\u201d</p><p>You let out a broken laugh as you picked her up, holding her close. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t make you sad, did I?\u201d She shook her head and you felt relief wash over you. From behind, you could hear Pepper\u2019s footsteps stop in your doorway and you turned to look at her. \u201cI probably look like a mess.\u201d</p><p>Pepper smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s a good mess.\u201d She glanced over your shoulder, noticing the still paused hologram of Tony and the blown-up picture on the wall. \u201cI\u2019m glad that he left you a message.\u201d</p><p>You sniffed, \u201cI needed it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cF.R.I.D.A.Y., end the message and if you could, have that picture printed out. I think it deserves to be framed.\u201d Pepper stepped forward and settled a gentle hand on your shoulder. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be okay.\u201d</p><p>You nodded and took a deep breath in. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be okay.\u201d</p>",

It hurts. That\u2019s all there is to say because you were tired of describing the mind-numbing sensation of having regurgitated everything out of your stomach, screamed your throat raw, and cried until it felt like your eyes would bleed. You were empty and your heart was in a jar; pickling itself in order to preserve its functioning for later.</p><p>It hurts, but you hadn\u2019t given up. You had merely tucked it away.</p><p>That is what happens after a war. Things are rebuilt but are never the same as when they were initially created, and healing is a process that is best left up to the person doing the work to describe. It is all a very strenuous and lingering process that scars over eventually, but nobody can quite say when.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do when there\u2019s no one with you anymore?\u201d</p><p>You simply blink at the man that is helping with the rebuilding. His eyes are filled with deep sorrow, like everyone that he loved wasn\u2019t brought back with the snap \u2013 and maybe not all of them were, but you had no sympathy to give him.</p><p>\u201cIs that a question you should be asking a complete stranger?\u201d</p><p>He shrugs his shoulders like it isn\u2019t that big of a deal to him or even to you. \u201cIs there anyone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course there is,\u201d you look at the half-built shell of the Avengers compound and exhale heavily. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean that they stuck around.\u201d</p><p>This was your home just like it was Natasha\u2019s, and now she wasn\u2019t even there to help occupy it. Peter, Thor, Bucky, Sam, Bru- Professor Hulk, Clint, Steve\u2026 Everyone. They all had their own lives to live elsewhere, while yours was still here. Rebuilding. Healing.</p><p>Pepper had offered the guest room at their house, providing you with an option to stay close to what you knew, but it was honestly too much to consider. Feelings of being detached wasn\u2019t something Morgan needed to be put through, the little one was young and terribly impressionable. The mannerisms, the intelligence, the <i>smile</i>\u2026 everything was too much like her father in its purest form.</p><p><i>It\u2019s what\u2019s best</i>, you thought.</p><p>\u2013</p><p>The completion of the project hadn\u2019t taken too long, after a couple of months, and extreme help from Tony\u2019s original blueprints, the compound looked like it once did.</p><p>\u201cA group of people came by when we were finishing up the inside.\u201d The same man from before stood in front of you. The man with the melancholy look in his eyes. \u201cThey activated the tech and some voice command thingy came up \u2013 not entirely sure what they did, but they said they were friends.\u201d</p><p>The fact that people you didn\u2019t know \u2013 but probably did, there aren\u2019t that many people that could possibly get by the \u2018<i>voice command thingy</i>\u2019 without being a friendly acquaintance \u2013 had been on site was a little worrying.</p><p>You nodded, \u201cAlright, thank you for your time.\u201d</p><p>His eyes lingered on you briefly before opening his mouth to speak again. \u201cIt gets easier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes it now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEventually,\u201d He smiled. \u201cIt never really goes away, but you learn how to function again.\u201d</p><p>There was a tight twist behind your rib cage, and you took a deep breath in. Part of you thought that the feeling was your heart stirring inside of the jar, anticipating the easier parts of this misery business.</p><p>Having stepped into the common area, the first thing you noticed was the different couches and tables that sat within the room. Although the interior design wasn\u2019t the same, everything else was nothing short of nauseating nostalgia. It was a rush of memories flickering throughout the room as your eyes blurred with the images of the people that once inhabited the area.</p><p><i>\u201cListen, kid\u2014\"</i></p><p><i>\u201cTony, if you call me a kid one more time\u2014\u201d</i></p><p><i>There was a loud sigh from Natasha from the other side of the room, lounging on one of the sectionals. \u201cYou both are children.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cIt\u2019s how I keep my boyish good looks.\u201d Tony gave her a smile laced with cockiness before turning back to you. \u201cAs I was saying, blueberries are superior, and they are in every part of this facility for a reason.\u201d</i></p><p><i>You shook your head, \u201cNegative, raspberries are the superior berry. They\u2019re delicious in desserts and they\u2019re a great source of fiber!\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou\u2019re impossible. Have you ever heard of blueberry pancakes? Blueberry muffins?\u201d</i></p><p><i>Next to you, Cap made a noise of agreement. \u201cHe\u2019s got you there.\u201d</i></p><p><i>As soon as Steve agreed with Tony, you narrowed your eyes. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t have me, Rogers. Raspberries can be in pancakes and muffins, too!\u201d Grabbing a raspberry from your container, you threw it at Thor\u2019s head. \u201cThor, which is your favorite? Raspberries or Blueberries?\u201d</i></p><p><i> </i></p><p><i>Stark crossed his arms over his chest, but not before throwing a blueberry at Thor as well. \u201cChoose wisely, point break, and the title of Strongest Avenger may just have your name next to it.\u201d</i></p><p><i> </i></p><p><i>Banner looked up from his book, \u201cIsn\u2019t that my title?\u201d Tony shushed him loudly.</i></p><p><i> </i></p><p><i>\u201cI <b>am</b> the strongest avenger,\u201d Thor mumbled, eating both berries one at a time. He hesitated only for a moment before looking between the two of you. \u201cBlueberries.\u201d</i></p><p><i> </i></p><p><i>There was a scoff over by Nat, and Clint muttered, \u201cKiss ass,\u201d under his breath.</i></p><p><i> </i></p><p><i>\u201cI hate the both of you so much right now.\u201d You threw two raspberries in your mouth, but not before Tony leaned over and stole one from you.</i></p><p><i> </i></p><p><i>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t,\u201d his smile was wide and genuine, and impossible not to mirror it.</i></p><p>On a shaky exhale, you blinked away the memory and let your hands run over the different surfaces. Making your way to the screening room, you dug your fingertips into the material of the chairs in there.</p><p>\u201cF.R.I.D.A.Y.?\u201d you called, entirely unsure if she was even still active or if you would have to find another backup interface.</p><p>There wasn\u2019t a response back and it felt like the air had been sucked out of the room then. You fell into one of the seats, staring at the large empty screen before the silence became too much and you shut your eyes. Nothing in this facility had been built by Tony. Everything, although cosmetically similar, felt foreign and unreal. This building had once been part of Stark Industries, built a long time ago and then completely renovated by Tony to be a home for the Avengers. His friends \u2013 the friends that no longer needed a place to stay.</p><p>\u201cMy apologies,\u201d The voice startled you. \u201cBecause of the previous damage, I had to update my internal system. How can I be of assistance?\u201d</p><p>You laughed, but it came out broken. \u201cIt\u2019s no problem, F.R.I.D.A.Y., I\u2019m glad to hear your voice. I don\u2019t know if you still have the photos I downloaded last summer, but\u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, the \u2018<i>save for a rainy day</i>\u2019 file. Would you like to view them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, please.\u201d</p><p>The photos had been taken at the Stark residence last summer when you had come to visit the family of three. Photos of board games, hide and seek in the woods, kayaking on the lake, and dinner at the table were all compiled within this file you had asked F.R.I.D.A.Y. to keep for you.</p><p>A few of the pictures were blurry, taken accidentally in your haste and panic to find Morgan. She had gotten much too good at the game of hide and seek that you couldn\u2019t find her after nearly thirty minutes of seeking. In the woods, Tony and Pepper had called out for her frantically, looking in piles of leaves and behind overly large rocks, but there was no trace of her.</p><p>In the slideshow was a picture of a tree so large that you imagined it being centuries older than any super soldier alive. When you had rounded it, there in its hollowed-out center was Morgan, nestled inside with her knees up to her chest and the mask that Tony had made for Pepper.</p><p><i>\u201cMorgan!\u201d you\u2019d huffed, collapsing down to your knees in relief at the sound of her giggles.</i></p><p><i> </i></p><p><i>\u201cHold still,\u201d you said quietly, and snapped a picture of her in the helmet before taking it off and scooping her up in your arms. \u201cI found her!\u201d</i></p><p><i>Tony, having panicked earlier and far quicker than either you or Pepper, landed next to the two of you in a flurry of dirt and leaves with his Iron Man suit on.</i></p><p><i>\u201cMunchkin,\u201d his voice sounded like something akin to relieved hysterics when his mask phased off. \u201cYou scared the daylights out of me!\u201d</i></p><p><i>Pepper ran up then, out of breath but with a smile on her face even as she gently scolded her daughter. \u201cMorgan, you have to answer us when we call for you, ok?\u201d</i></p><p><i>Morgan tilted her head and made a funny face, \u201cBut then I wouldn\u2019t win.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Tony let out a startled laugh, tapping a mechanism so that his suit retracted and disappeared off him before he took Morgan from you.</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou know I love you tons, kiddo.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Pepper kissed her head and you smiled; warmth blossomed in your chest at the sight of the three of them. They were finally happy with their family complete. Tony got his second chance at the life he should\u2019ve initially led.</i></p><p><i>Morgan buried her head into Tony\u2019s neck and closed her eyes, seeming overly tired by the festivities. \u201cLove you 3000,\u201d she mumbled sleepily.</i></p><p>\u2014</p><p>\u201cMiss?\u201d F.R.I.D.A.Y.\u2019s voice was soft and inquisitive, gently pulling you out of your memories.</p><p>You\u2019d gotten lost inside of your head only to realize once coming back into focus that the slideshow of pictures had stopped. The image it had finished on was a group picture, everyone that you had ever cared about sitting and smiling around a large dining table made to accommodate the overly large family. Everyone was happy, young, and <i>alive</i>.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry F.R.I.D.A.Y., what did you ask?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is a file flagged, called: Spider-Dad. Would you like to view it?\u201d</p><p>The picture was already clear in your mind, but you had it flagged for a reason. \u201cYes, please.\u201d</p><p>In an instant, the picture was blown up on the screen in high-definition. It had been a photo you\u2019d taken some time ago of Peter and Tony, the friendly neighborhood Spider-Man had come by per Stark\u2019s request in order to help him figure out his new suit. It was a picture of Peter, mask off, deploying the suit\u2019s Spider-Legs capability, Peter had been startled and Tony had his head thrown back in laughter. It was a moment of pure unadulterated bliss, something that was rarely captured in the Avengers compound.</p><p>\u201cCan you send this to Peter?\u201d</p><p>The image shrank down as F.R.I.D.A.Y. pulled up Parker\u2019s information. \u201cHow would you like to send it?\u201d</p><p>You looked at the options presented to you. There was email, text message, mail, or even a damn hologram that would project out of whatever tech Tony had supplied him with. The last thing you needed was a picture of him in the spider suit projecting out of said <i>spider suit</i> during class or something.</p><p>\u201cText message is fine. Let him know it\u2019s from me and that he better be keeping himself out of trouble.\u201d</p><p>With a sigh, you retired to the area of the compound that held what was once your room. All your belongings had been destroyed in the fight against Thanos. The only items that were left happened to be kept at the Stark residence, but it still was only a few books, a couple articles of clothing, and old trinkets that you\u2019d long forgotten about.</p><p>Collapsing down in the much too firm desk chair, you spun yourself around in it slowly. The walls of this room had once been colored a soft grey with one of the walls a pitch black, made for writing on with chalk. Tony had poked fun at you when he\u2019d seen words and images written all over it.</p><p><i>\u201cYou have highly advanced tech at your fingertips and yet here you are, doodling on my property.\u201d He gestured wildly at the outline of the art, but despite his words there was a smile tugging at the corners of his mouth. \u201cHow old are you again?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhy?\u201d You snickered, \u201cAre you gonna ground me for writing on the walls, dad?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI could.\u201d Tony tapped at his chin, pretending to think about it. \u201cI\u2019m probably old enough to be your dad, but I prefer to be the cool, devilishly handsome uncle that teaches you minor bad habits when you stay with him during the summer.\u201d</i></p><p><i>With a roll of your eyes you returned to the sketch. \u201cYou\u2019re a handful and a half.\u201d</i></p><p><i>A short pause later, Tony spoke again. \u201cIs that a no to the familial ties, then?\u201d</i></p><p><i>There was a chance your ears had played a trick on you, but his question seemed lace with the tiniest bit of disappointment.</i></p><p><i>\u201cWell,\u201d you said, turning back around to face him. \u201cYou saved me from being trafficked, gave me a place to call home, gave me a purpose by helping the Avengers, and because of that I have the most supportive group of people in my life now.\u201d You smiled softly at him after gesturing at your framed pictures on the walls. \u201cI think we\u2019ve been family since the beginning.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 uh, that\u2019s great.\u201d After maintaining eye contact with you for a brief minute, Tony gave a sharp nod and cleared his throat. \u201cAlright! Lunch in ten, bring an iron stomach because Romanoff is doing the cooking!\u201d</i></p><p><i>He turned around swiftly to leave, but before he made it all the way out, you stopped him.</i></p><p><i>\u201cHey, Tony?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cHm?\u201d He leaned back and stuck his head in the doorway. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cThank you,\u201d you said quietly, hoping that he knew what you meant. That it was all encompassing gratitude for the life he had provided for you.</i></p><p><i>A second chance.</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou know, it\u2019s moments like these when I realize what a superhero I am.\u201d For the second time you rolled your eyes, but he winked at you and said. \u201cI\u2019d do it again in a heartbeat, kid.\u201d</i></p><p>A screen suddenly projected on one of the walls and assuming it was F.R.I.D.A.Y., you sat up straighter in the seat.</p><p>\u201cA message from Peter Parker, miss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does it say?\u201d You absently rubbed at the center of your chest having felt an uncomfortable pressure there.</p><p>\u201cIt says: <b>I miss him</b>.\u201d</p><p>Closing your eyes, you sighed. \u201cOk, thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have come across another file that requires your attention.\u201d</p><p>F.R.I.D.A.Y. didn\u2019t wait for your permission to access it, meaning that it wasn\u2019t something of yours that you\u2019d tucked away in the database.</p><p>It appeared in a flash; the image of Tony projected onto the floor of your room as a hologram.</p><p>\u201cHey there, kid. It\u2019s your cool superhero uncle here.\u201d The smile on his face was distant but fond, like he\u2019d remembered the same thing I just had once he spoke. His head turned to the wall that used to be covered in your chalk drawings and you wondered if he\u2019d recorded this in your room. \u201cYou\u2019re probably wondering if I recorded this message in your room, and the answer is yeah, I definitely did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s an invasion of privacy, you loser.\u201d Your voice cracked and you bit into your lip to force yourself not to cry. You were <i>finished</i> with the tears.</p><p>\u201cI left Pep and Morgan a message already in case I, uh\u2026 in case I don\u2019t make it, but I wanted to leave you one too. After all, both you and Peter made me realize I might not be so bad at this whole dad thing.\u201d</p><p>You stood up and the uncomfortable feeling started to grow when you got closer to him. You wanted to watch him and the way he moved, his mannerisms that you saw so vividly in his daughter \u2013 small things, like the way he spoke with his hands and when he spoke quickly to get in a witty remark, you hoped had stuck with you too.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to thank you,\u201d it felt like he had looked directly at you. \u201cYou would always tell people that I saved you, but you saved me right back, kid.\u201d He had a rectangular piece of paper in his hands that he kept fiddling with absently, the movement of his fingers catching your attention every so often. \u201cI\u2019m arrogant, conceited, narcissistic, but you\u2019re one of the people that helped me believe that I could be more. You, Peter, Morgan, Pepper, you all made me believe in more than just myself.\u201d</p><p>He stopped, looking down at the thing he held in his hand once before continuing, but this time he sighed like he was weighing certain things in his mind. \u201cThis time heist thing is a little dangerous, a little confusing, and I know you hate not being part of the action, but you gotta hold down the fort this time around. I\u2019m gonna try my damnedest to bring everyone back. Whatever it takes\u2026 or whatever other rallying mantra Cap has been spewing lately, who knows. Anyways, kid, as Morgan says,\u201d He took what was in his hand and turned it around so that the image was facing outward before he pressed it against his chest. \u201c\u2018I love you 3000\u2019.\u201d</p><p>Right before it ended, you called out to F.R.I.D.A.Y., \u201cPause the transmission!\u201d</p><p>Finally, you could see what Tony had been moving around in his hands, clear as day. It was an image of the four of you, Morgan as a newborn in Pepper\u2019s arms as Tony sits next to her on the couch in awe of his daughter, and you peering over Pepper\u2019s shoulder with a wide smile on your face. You\u2019d never seen this picture before and that feeling in your chest came back even worse than before.</p><p>\u201cF.R.I.D.A.Y., do you have the original of the picture Tony\u2019s holding?\u201d</p><p>After several seconds, F.R.I.D.A.Y. responded. \u201cYes, he has it organized in a private file titled, <i>Family</i>. Would you like for me to open it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cN-no, I\u2026 Just the one picture is fine.\u201d The picture was there on the screen of your wall while Tony stood frozen in the transmission with a resigned smile on his face. \u201cYou made the sacrifice play,\u201d you inhaled deeply, something in your chest having shattered with the force of it. \u201cAnd I\u2019m trying really hard not to hate you for it. I miss you <i>so much</i>.\u201d</p><p>The shattering was the sound of the jar that you kept everything bottled up in. The metaphorical dam had broken as the crying came back in bone rattling sobs and hiccupping as you struggled to catch your breath. Everything ached too deeply, and the overwhelming sense of loneliness began to cover you like a weighted blanket. Even in the years you had lived before you met Tony Stark, nothing that you lost had ever felt <i>this</i> dreadful.</p><p>Little arms wrapped around your legs, startling you and halting your cries. \u201cM-Morgan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t cry, mommy brought juice pops.\u201d</p><p>You let out a broken laugh as you picked her up, holding her close. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t make you sad, did I?\u201d She shook her head and you felt relief wash over you. From behind, you could hear Pepper\u2019s footsteps stop in your doorway and you turned to look at her. \u201cI probably look like a mess.\u201d</p><p>Pepper smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s a good mess.\u201d She glanced over your shoulder, noticing the still paused hologram of Tony and the blown-up picture on the wall. \u201cI\u2019m glad that he left you a message.\u201d</p><p>You sniffed, \u201cI needed it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cF.R.I.D.A.Y., end the message and if you could, have that picture printed out. I think it deserves to be framed.\u201d Pepper stepped forward and settled a gentle hand on your shoulder. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be okay.\u201d</p><p>You nodded and took a deep breath in. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be okay.\u201d</p>",

It hurts. That&rsquo;s all there is to say because you were tired of describing the mind-numbing sensation of having regurgitated everything out of your stomach, screamed your throat raw, and cried until it felt like your eyes would bleed. You were empty and your heart was in a jar; pickling itself in order to preserve its functioning for later.</p><p>It hurts, but you hadn&rsquo;t given up. You had merely tucked it away.</p><p>That is what happens after a war. Things are rebuilt but are never the same as when they were initially created, and healing is a process that is best left up to the person doing the work to describe. It is all a very strenuous and lingering process that scars over eventually, but nobody can quite say when.</p><p>&ldquo;What are you going to do when there&rsquo;s no one with you anymore?&rdquo;</p><p>You simply blink at the man that is helping with the rebuilding. His eyes are filled with deep sorrow, like everyone that he loved wasn&rsquo;t brought back with the snap &ndash; and maybe not all of them were, but you had no sympathy to give him.</p><p>&ldquo;Is that a question you should be asking a complete stranger?&rdquo;</p><p>He shrugs his shoulders like it isn&rsquo;t that big of a deal to him or even to you. &ldquo;Is there anyone?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Of course there is,&rdquo; you look at the half-built shell of the Avengers compound and exhale heavily. &ldquo;But that doesn&rsquo;t mean that they stuck around.&rdquo;</p><p>This was your home just like it was Natasha&rsquo;s, and now she wasn&rsquo;t even there to help occupy it. Peter, Thor, Bucky, Sam, Bru- Professor Hulk, Clint, Steve&hellip; Everyone. They all had their own lives to live elsewhere, while yours was still here. Rebuilding. Healing.</p><p>Pepper had offered the guest room at their house, providing you with an option to stay close to what you knew, but it was honestly too much to consider. Feelings of being detached wasn&rsquo;t something Morgan needed to be put through, the little one was young and terribly impressionable. The mannerisms, the intelligence, the <i>smile</i>&hellip; everything was too much like her father in its purest form.</p><p><i>It&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s best</i>, you thought.</p><p>&ndash;</p><p>The completion of the project hadn&rsquo;t taken too long, after a couple of months, and extreme help from Tony&rsquo;s original blueprints, the compound looked like it once did.</p><p>&ldquo;A group of people came by when we were finishing up the inside.&rdquo; The same man from before stood in front of you. The man with the melancholy look in his eyes. &ldquo;They activated the tech and some voice command thingy came up &ndash; not entirely sure what they did, but they said they were friends.&rdquo;</p><p>The fact that people you didn&rsquo;t know &ndash; but probably did, there aren&rsquo;t that many people that could possibly get by the &lsquo;<i>voice command thingy</i>&rsquo; without being a friendly acquaintance &ndash; had been on site was a little worrying.</p><p>You nodded, &ldquo;Alright, thank you for your time.&rdquo;</p><p>His eyes lingered on you briefly before opening his mouth to speak again. &ldquo;It gets easier.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Does it now?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Eventually,&rdquo; He smiled. &ldquo;It never really goes away, but you learn how to function again.&rdquo;</p><p>There was a tight twist behind your rib cage, and you took a deep breath in. Part of you thought that the feeling was your heart stirring inside of the jar, anticipating the easier parts of this misery business.</p><p>Having stepped into the common area, the first thing you noticed was the different couches and tables that sat within the room. Although the interior design wasn&rsquo;t the same, everything else was nothing short of nauseating nostalgia. It was a rush of memories flickering throughout the room as your eyes blurred with the images of the people that once inhabited the area.</p><p><i>&ldquo;Listen, kid&mdash;\"</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Tony, if you call me a kid one more time&mdash;&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>There was a loud sigh from Natasha from the other side of the room, lounging on one of the sectionals. &ldquo;You both are children.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s how I keep my boyish good looks.&rdquo; Tony gave her a smile laced with cockiness before turning back to you. &ldquo;As I was saying, blueberries are superior, and they are in every part of this facility for a reason.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>You shook your head, &ldquo;Negative, raspberries are the superior berry. They&rsquo;re delicious in desserts and they&rsquo;re a great source of fiber!&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re impossible. Have you ever heard of blueberry pancakes? Blueberry muffins?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Next to you, Cap made a noise of agreement. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s got you there.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>As soon as Steve agreed with Tony, you narrowed your eyes. &ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t have me, Rogers. Raspberries can be in pancakes and muffins, too!&rdquo; Grabbing a raspberry from your container, you threw it at Thor&rsquo;s head. &ldquo;Thor, which is your favorite? Raspberries or Blueberries?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i> </i></p><p><i>Stark crossed his arms over his chest, but not before throwing a blueberry at Thor as well. &ldquo;Choose wisely, point break, and the title of Strongest Avenger may just have your name next to it.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i> </i></p><p><i>Banner looked up from his book, &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that my title?&rdquo; Tony shushed him loudly.</i></p><p><i> </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I <b>am</b> the strongest avenger,&rdquo; Thor mumbled, eating both berries one at a time. He hesitated only for a moment before looking between the two of you. &ldquo;Blueberries.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i> </i></p><p><i>There was a scoff over by Nat, and Clint muttered, &ldquo;Kiss ass,&rdquo; under his breath.</i></p><p><i> </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I hate the both of you so much right now.&rdquo; You threw two raspberries in your mouth, but not before Tony leaned over and stole one from you.</i></p><p><i> </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;No, you don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; his smile was wide and genuine, and impossible not to mirror it.</i></p><p>On a shaky exhale, you blinked away the memory and let your hands run over the different surfaces. Making your way to the screening room, you dug your fingertips into the material of the chairs in there.</p><p>&ldquo;F.R.I.D.A.Y.?&rdquo; you called, entirely unsure if she was even still active or if you would have to find another backup interface.</p><p>There wasn&rsquo;t a response back and it felt like the air had been sucked out of the room then. You fell into one of the seats, staring at the large empty screen before the silence became too much and you shut your eyes. Nothing in this facility had been built by Tony. Everything, although cosmetically similar, felt foreign and unreal. This building had once been part of Stark Industries, built a long time ago and then completely renovated by Tony to be a home for the Avengers. His friends &ndash; the friends that no longer needed a place to stay.</p><p>&ldquo;My apologies,&rdquo; The voice startled you. &ldquo;Because of the previous damage, I had to update my internal system. How can I be of assistance?&rdquo;</p><p>You laughed, but it came out broken. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no problem, F.R.I.D.A.Y., I&rsquo;m glad to hear your voice. I don&rsquo;t know if you still have the photos I downloaded last summer, but&ndash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, the &lsquo;<i>save for a rainy day</i>&rsquo; file. Would you like to view them?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, please.&rdquo;</p><p>The photos had been taken at the Stark residence last summer when you had come to visit the family of three. Photos of board games, hide and seek in the woods, kayaking on the lake, and dinner at the table were all compiled within this file you had asked F.R.I.D.A.Y. to keep for you.</p><p>A few of the pictures were blurry, taken accidentally in your haste and panic to find Morgan. She had gotten much too good at the game of hide and seek that you couldn&rsquo;t find her after nearly thirty minutes of seeking. In the woods, Tony and Pepper had called out for her frantically, looking in piles of leaves and behind overly large rocks, but there was no trace of her.</p><p>In the slideshow was a picture of a tree so large that you imagined it being centuries older than any super soldier alive. When you had rounded it, there in its hollowed-out center was Morgan, nestled inside with her knees up to her chest and the mask that Tony had made for Pepper.</p><p><i>&ldquo;Morgan!&rdquo; you&rsquo;d huffed, collapsing down to your knees in relief at the sound of her giggles.</i></p><p><i> </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Hold still,&rdquo; you said quietly, and snapped a picture of her in the helmet before taking it off and scooping her up in your arms. &ldquo;I found her!&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Tony, having panicked earlier and far quicker than either you or Pepper, landed next to the two of you in a flurry of dirt and leaves with his Iron Man suit on.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Munchkin,&rdquo; his voice sounded like something akin to relieved hysterics when his mask phased off. &ldquo;You scared the daylights out of me!&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Pepper ran up then, out of breath but with a smile on her face even as she gently scolded her daughter. &ldquo;Morgan, you have to answer us when we call for you, ok?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Morgan tilted her head and made a funny face, &ldquo;But then I wouldn&rsquo;t win.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Tony let out a startled laugh, tapping a mechanism so that his suit retracted and disappeared off him before he took Morgan from you.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;You know I love you tons, kiddo.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Pepper kissed her head and you smiled; warmth blossomed in your chest at the sight of the three of them. They were finally happy with their family complete. Tony got his second chance at the life he should&rsquo;ve initially led.</i></p><p><i>Morgan buried her head into Tony&rsquo;s neck and closed her eyes, seeming overly tired by the festivities. &ldquo;Love you 3000,&rdquo; she mumbled sleepily.</i></p><p>&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Miss?&rdquo; F.R.I.D.A.Y.&rsquo;s voice was soft and inquisitive, gently pulling you out of your memories.</p><p>You&rsquo;d gotten lost inside of your head only to realize once coming back into focus that the slideshow of pictures had stopped. The image it had finished on was a group picture, everyone that you had ever cared about sitting and smiling around a large dining table made to accommodate the overly large family. Everyone was happy, young, and <i>alive</i>.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry F.R.I.D.A.Y., what did you ask?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;There is a file flagged, called: Spider-Dad. Would you like to view it?&rdquo;</p><p>The picture was already clear in your mind, but you had it flagged for a reason. &ldquo;Yes, please.&rdquo;</p><p>In an instant, the picture was blown up on the screen in high-definition. It had been a photo you&rsquo;d taken some time ago of Peter and Tony, the friendly neighborhood Spider-Man had come by per Stark&rsquo;s request in order to help him figure out his new suit. It was a picture of Peter, mask off, deploying the suit&rsquo;s Spider-Legs capability, Peter had been startled and Tony had his head thrown back in laughter. It was a moment of pure unadulterated bliss, something that was rarely captured in the Avengers compound.</p><p>&ldquo;Can you send this to Peter?&rdquo;</p><p>The image shrank down as F.R.I.D.A.Y. pulled up Parker&rsquo;s information. &ldquo;How would you like to send it?&rdquo;</p><p>You looked at the options presented to you. There was email, text message, mail, or even a damn hologram that would project out of whatever tech Tony had supplied him with. The last thing you needed was a picture of him in the spider suit projecting out of said <i>spider suit</i> during class or something.</p><p>&ldquo;Text message is fine. Let him know it&rsquo;s from me and that he better be keeping himself out of trouble.&rdquo;</p><p>With a sigh, you retired to the area of the compound that held what was once your room. All your belongings had been destroyed in the fight against Thanos. The only items that were left happened to be kept at the Stark residence, but it still was only a few books, a couple articles of clothing, and old trinkets that you&rsquo;d long forgotten about.</p><p>Collapsing down in the much too firm desk chair, you spun yourself around in it slowly. The walls of this room had once been colored a soft grey with one of the walls a pitch black, made for writing on with chalk. Tony had poked fun at you when he&rsquo;d seen words and images written all over it.</p><p><i>&ldquo;You have highly advanced tech at your fingertips and yet here you are, doodling on my property.&rdquo; He gestured wildly at the outline of the art, but despite his words there was a smile tugging at the corners of his mouth. &ldquo;How old are you again?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; You snickered, &ldquo;Are you gonna ground me for writing on the walls, dad?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I could.&rdquo; Tony tapped at his chin, pretending to think about it. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m probably old enough to be your dad, but I prefer to be the cool, devilishly handsome uncle that teaches you minor bad habits when you stay with him during the summer.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>With a roll of your eyes you returned to the sketch. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a handful and a half.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>A short pause later, Tony spoke again. &ldquo;Is that a no to the familial ties, then?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>There was a chance your ears had played a trick on you, but his question seemed lace with the tiniest bit of disappointment.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; you said, turning back around to face him. &ldquo;You saved me from being trafficked, gave me a place to call home, gave me a purpose by helping the Avengers, and because of that I have the most supportive group of people in my life now.&rdquo; You smiled softly at him after gesturing at your framed pictures on the walls. &ldquo;I think we&rsquo;ve been family since the beginning.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s&hellip; uh, that&rsquo;s great.&rdquo; After maintaining eye contact with you for a brief minute, Tony gave a sharp nod and cleared his throat. &ldquo;Alright! Lunch in ten, bring an iron stomach because Romanoff is doing the cooking!&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>He turned around swiftly to leave, but before he made it all the way out, you stopped him.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Hey, Tony?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Hm?&rdquo; He leaned back and stuck his head in the doorway. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; you said quietly, hoping that he knew what you meant.

I miss you <i>so much</i>.&rdquo;</p><p>The shattering was the sound of the jar that you kept everything bottled up in. The metaphorical dam had broken as the crying came back in bone rattling sobs and hiccupping as you struggled to catch your breath. Everything ached too deeply, and the overwhelming sense of loneliness began to cover you like a weighted blanket. Even in the years you had lived before you met Tony Stark, nothing that you lost had ever felt <i>this</i> dreadful.</p><p>Little arms wrapped around your legs, startling you and halting your cries. &ldquo;M-Morgan?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t cry, mommy brought juice pops.&rdquo;</p><p>You let out a broken laugh as you picked her up, holding her close. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, I didn&rsquo;t make you sad, did I?&rdquo; She shook her head and you felt relief wash over you. From behind, you could hear Pepper&rsquo;s footsteps stop in your doorway and you turned to look at her. &ldquo;I probably look like a mess.&rdquo;</p><p>Pepper smiled. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good mess.&rdquo; She glanced over your shoulder, noticing the still paused hologram of Tony and the blown-up picture on the wall. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad that he left you a message.&rdquo;</p><p>You sniffed, &ldquo;I needed it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;F.R.I.D.A.Y., end the message and if you could, have that picture printed out. I think it deserves to be framed.&rdquo; Pepper stepped forward and settled a gentle hand on your shoulder. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to be okay.&rdquo;</p><p>You nodded and took a deep breath in. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to be okay.&rdquo;</p>",

They wouldn\u2019t have spent 11 years getting us to invest our emotions into Tony Stark and into his relationship with Pepper; they wouldn\u2019t have gotten our hopes up so high by having them get engaged and talk about having Morgan if they were going to let him die. Even when I was sitting in the theater seeing all of those scenes between Tony and Morgan, I still thought to myself, surely they would never take this sweet little girl\u2019s daddy from her. Up until those very last moments I really thought he was going to make it and then they just took <i>everything</i> from us. They took away Pepper\u2019s husband and the love of her life. They took away Morgan\u2019s daddy who she loved 3000. They took away the chance for Tony to finally be able to enjoy his life without the burden of the deaths of his friends, of Peter, of half the entire world. He could have been so happy. He had everything he ever wanted right there in a house by the lake and I really believed after this one last fight was over, he was going to be able to go back to that a much happier man, who was completely okay with stepping back and passing the torch on to Peter and the others. I believed in that ending so hard that I convinced myself it would come true. I had placed my faith in all these writers and directors and Marvel to handle Tony Stark with the love and care he deserved and I am astonished by just how badly they failed. Many of us have been there every single opening day since Iron Man and we have given so much time and love and emotion over to Marvel and they threw it away like it was nothing; like it didn\u2019t matter and that Tony Stark\u2019s life and the man we watched him become didn\u2019t matter. Maybe I\u2019m just being selfish and maybe I\u2019m in the wrong for believing that we were owed a happy ending for Tony Stark, but I know with 100% certainty they owed that to RDJ. Maybe we didn\u2019t earn that happy ending for him, but RDJ did and he\u2019s the one my heart aches for the most.</p>",
