Around this neck of the woods you'll find history stuff, nature stuff, whatever fandoms I'm into at the moment, fanfics I write when I can muster up the energy, the occasional mental breakdown and a variety of fun facts I come across or things I find interesting. Feel free to follow or drop me a line, I promise I'm quite tame.</p>",

                "content": "<p>I&rsquo;ve seen a bunch of people theorizing that Trent Ikithon altered Caleb&rsquo;s memories so he&rsquo;d believe that he killed his parents, even though he didn&rsquo;t. I think it&rsquo;s entirely possible within the world Matt has built, but I&rsquo;m almost entirely positive it&rsquo;ll never be canon for one big reason: Matt would never do that to Liam.&nbsp;</p><p>First off, it breaks the characterization of Caleb that Liam has put so much hard work into. It would be different if Caleb didn&rsquo;t have so much trauma caught up in the violent deaths of his parents, and it would be different if his one big objective wasn&rsquo;t to bend reality and make it so that his parents never died. But these are two vital parts of Caleb&rsquo;s character, and revealing that he never killed his parents, and that Trent just made him think he did? That breaks the character. He no longer has any long-term goals (except for possibly defeating Trent, but Caleb has made it very clear that he is entirely too fearful of Trent&rsquo;s immense magical prowess to even dream of attempting that for a VERY long time). If this happened, it might trigger some kind of existential crisis, and reverse all of the progress he&rsquo;s made in terms of trusting the people he&rsquo;s with, and trusting himself.&nbsp;</p><p>But most importantly, it breaks the first big rule of all improv:&nbsp;&ldquo;Yes, and&hellip;&rdquo; If Caleb&rsquo;s murder of his parents wasn&rsquo;t so vital to his character, again, this would be different.
