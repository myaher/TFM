It was for mental health reasons \u2013 mood balancing, mood management. It was hard for me to leave my apartment and do normal things as a human being,\u201d she said.</p>\n<p>Depression or sadness are very common reasons for starting; Avey was unusual only in that she could be open about it. Her workplace knew and thought it was fine. \u201cAs long as I wasn\u2019t out of control or permanently high at work they were quite OK.\u201d</p>\n<p>She took about 15 micrograms (a whole tab is 100 micrograms). \u201cThat was a good amount for me. Some people take as little as six,\u201d she said. She adopted a popular protocol \u2013 one day on, three days off.</p>\n<p>It worked for her. \u201cIt definitely had the effect I wanted,\u201d she said. \u201cIt lifted me out of a pretty deep depression. I\u2019m still trying to wrap my head around what it has done to me in the long-term. I think it has changed me.\u201d She had been \u201cpretty negative\u201d, she said, mindlessly going through social media, plagued with obsessive thoughts.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m able to be more mindful of my emotions. If I\u2019m feeling sad, that\u2019s OK. I don\u2019t obsess anymore. I don\u2019t dwell on it. I don\u2019t get worked up about it.\u201d</p>\n<p>She and others spoke of becoming more aware of the need to be active, cut down on alcohol and eat healthily. She talked of heightened energy and heightened awareness. In the beginning she felt more productive and creative, but later that became more of a problem.</p>\n<p>\u201cI was able to get all my work done but around 2pm to 3pm I would hit this wall of really needing to go out for a walk, a need to be moving,\u201d she said. And although it lifted her depression, she felt more anxiety. \u201cThere were one or two experiences when I did feel a bit overwhelmed. If people experience high levels of anxiety, I don\u2019t think this is for them.\u201d</p>\n<p>Microdosing, for her, is a transformative psychological experience and she is not the only one who feels it is in danger of being misused in Silicon Valley. \u201cTo think of people using this just to write code faster does seem a bit superficial. But it might be good for them. They might re-evaluate their lives in ways.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not the answer to everything. She left her job and moved on. <a href=\"https://medium.com/s/story/the-mental-and-metaphysical-effects-of-microdosing-lsd-72819896215d\">In a blog</a>, Avey wrote: \u201cThere\u2019s no magic pill. Microdosing is not a <em>good-time-guaranteed, call-now \u2018</em>remedy\u2019 or quick fix. Our minds are in conversation with our environments. We create and are created by our contexts. And in many cases, we don\u2019t need drugs, just a new environment.\u201d</p>\n<p>Alex, 35, (not his real name) is a paramedic in the NHS and can tell nobody that he microdoses. Severely depressed, he turned down his GP\u2019s offer of antidepressants which he had tried before without success, he said. He did a lot of reading and researching online before experimenting with microdoses of LSD.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat struck me was that there was no discernible difference at first,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d never tried LSD recreationally before so I had no idea what to expect. I stared at a blank wall every now and then just to make sure I didn\u2019t see any hallucinations, but there was nothing. Weirdly, it\u2019s not until the next day, in retrospect where you look back, that you realise you handled things, or reacted to things differently. It\u2019s so subtle it\u2019s easy to miss. But it definitely worked.</p>\n<p>\u201dI continued taking it for approximately three months \u2013 sometimes I\u2019d take a dose before work (around 9 mcg dose). I found that whilst it improved my concentration, I didn\u2019t want to become dependent on it for that purpose. Once I was out of that \u2018black hole\u2019 cycle I stopped taking it, but I will take it again if I need to.\u201d</p>\n<p>Adam, 30, (not his real name) lives in Germany and has been microdosing on magic mushrooms for five months, on and off. He also follows the one day on, three days off protocol. He says he is stereotypical of those who microdose: \u201csomeone who has been struggling with more or less intense depression all my life.\u201d Before he started, this spring, he was stuck in a rut, he said. \u201cI lost interest in my everyday activities. I had no sense of pride or joy.\u201d He was drinking too much red wine after work to calm down.</p>\n<p>Microdosing, he says, \u201cdoesn\u2019t make me feel better. It forces me to reflect on things. It helped me to reshape my daily habits.\u201d He got back into exercise \u2013 running on the days he microdosed, going to the gym the day after. He ate and slept better.</p>\n<p>There are downsides. \u201cI can get a little anxious on dosing days,\u201d he said. He talks of underestimating challenges, having to confront things and not duck them, whether thoughts or encounters with strangers. On microdosing days, he said, he is exhausted and in bed by 10pm. The second day brings an afterglow, he said, which is more pleasant.</p>\n<p>He too does not believe microdosing should be used to try to boost your career. \u201cI\u2019m not a big fan of people promulgating microdosing to a bunch of CEOs to increase their work,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>guardian.co.uk \u00a9 Guardian News &amp;

It was for mental health reasons &ndash; mood balancing, mood management. It was hard for me to leave my apartment and do normal things as a human being,&rdquo; she said.</p>\n<p>Depression or sadness are very common reasons for starting; Avey was unusual only in that she could be open about it. Her workplace knew and thought it was fine. &ldquo;As long as I wasn&rsquo;t out of control or permanently high at work they were quite OK.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>She took about 15 micrograms (a whole tab is 100 micrograms). &ldquo;That was a good amount for me. Some people take as little as six,&rdquo; she said. She adopted a popular protocol &ndash; one day on, three days off.</p>\n<p>It worked for her. &ldquo;It definitely had the effect I wanted,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It lifted me out of a pretty deep depression. I&rsquo;m still trying to wrap my head around what it has done to me in the long-term. I think it has changed me.&rdquo; She had been &ldquo;pretty negative&rdquo;, she said, mindlessly going through social media, plagued with obsessive thoughts.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m able to be more mindful of my emotions. If I&rsquo;m feeling sad, that&rsquo;s OK. I don&rsquo;t obsess anymore. I don&rsquo;t dwell on it. I don&rsquo;t get worked up about it.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>She and others spoke of becoming more aware of the need to be active, cut down on alcohol and eat healthily. She talked of heightened energy and heightened awareness. In the beginning she felt more productive and creative, but later that became more of a problem.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I was able to get all my work done but around 2pm to 3pm I would hit this wall of really needing to go out for a walk, a need to be moving,&rdquo; she said. And although it lifted her depression, she felt more anxiety. &ldquo;There were one or two experiences when I did feel a bit overwhelmed. If people experience high levels of anxiety, I don&rsquo;t think this is for them.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Microdosing, for her, is a transformative psychological experience and she is not the only one who feels it is in danger of being misused in Silicon Valley. &ldquo;To think of people using this just to write code faster does seem a bit superficial. But it might be good for them. They might re-evaluate their lives in ways.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s not the answer to everything. She left her job and moved on. <a href=\"https://medium.com/s/story/the-mental-and-metaphysical-effects-of-microdosing-lsd-72819896215d\">In a blog</a>, Avey wrote: &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no magic pill. Microdosing is not a <em>good-time-guaranteed, call-now &lsquo;</em>remedy&rsquo; or quick fix. Our minds are in conversation with our environments. We create and are created by our contexts. And in many cases, we don&rsquo;t need drugs, just a new environment.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Alex, 35, (not his real name) is a paramedic in the NHS and can tell nobody that he microdoses. Severely depressed, he turned down his GP&rsquo;s offer of antidepressants which he had tried before without success, he said. He did a lot of reading and researching online before experimenting with microdoses of LSD.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;What struck me was that there was no discernible difference at first,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d never tried LSD recreationally before so I had no idea what to expect. I stared at a blank wall every now and then just to make sure I didn&rsquo;t see any hallucinations, but there was nothing. Weirdly, it&rsquo;s not until the next day, in retrospect where you look back, that you realise you handled things, or reacted to things differently. It&rsquo;s so subtle it&rsquo;s easy to miss. But it definitely worked.</p>\n<p>&rdquo;I continued taking it for approximately three months &ndash; sometimes I&rsquo;d take a dose before work (around 9 mcg dose). I found that whilst it improved my concentration, I didn&rsquo;t want to become dependent on it for that purpose. Once I was out of that &lsquo;black hole&rsquo; cycle I stopped taking it, but I will take it again if I need to.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Adam, 30, (not his real name) lives in Germany and has been microdosing on magic mushrooms for five months, on and off. He also follows the one day on, three days off protocol. He says he is stereotypical of those who microdose: &ldquo;someone who has been struggling with more or less intense depression all my life.&rdquo; Before he started, this spring, he was stuck in a rut, he said. &ldquo;I lost interest in my everyday activities. I had no sense of pride or joy.&rdquo; He was drinking too much red wine after work to calm down.</p>\n<p>Microdosing, he says, &ldquo;doesn&rsquo;t make me feel better. It forces me to reflect on things. It helped me to reshape my daily habits.&rdquo; He got back into exercise &ndash; running on the days he microdosed, going to the gym the day after. He ate and slept better.</p>\n<p>There are downsides. &ldquo;I can get a little anxious on dosing days,&rdquo; he said. He talks of underestimating challenges, having to confront things and not duck them, whether thoughts or encounters with strangers. On microdosing days, he said, he is exhausted and in bed by 10pm. The second day brings an afterglow, he said, which is more pleasant.</p>\n<p>He too does not believe microdosing should be used to try to boost your career. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a big fan of people promulgating microdosing to a bunch of CEOs to increase their work,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n<p>guardian.co.uk &copy; Guardian News &amp; Media Limited 2010</p>\n<h3>Related Articles</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  <a href=\"http://newsrule.com/george-clooney-releases-rare-statement-announcing-hes-single/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t   George Clooney Releases Rare Statement Announcing &hellip;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  </a>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  <a href=\"http://newsrule.com/xbox-one-s-available-august-4k-movies-hdr-support/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t   Xbox One S Available in August with 4K Movies and &hellip;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  </a>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  <a href=\"http://newsrule.com/touchy-subject-a-breakthrough-for-gaming-and-virtual-reality/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t   Touchy subject: a breakthrough for gaming and virt&hellip;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  </a>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  <a href=\"http://newsrule.com/thirteen-dead-in-mumbai-building-collapse/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t   Thirteen dead in Mumbai building collapse\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  </a><p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t.yuzo_related_post imgwidth:155px !important; height:145px !important;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t.yuzo_related_post .relatedthumbline-height:15px;background: !important;color:!important;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t.yuzo_related_post .relatedthumb:hoverbackground:#fcfcf4 !important; -webkit-transition: background 0.2s linear; -moz-transition: background 0.2s linear; -o-transition: background 0.2s linear; transition: background 0.2s linear;;color:!important;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t.yuzo_related_post .relatedthumb acolor:!important;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t.yuzo_related_post .relatedthumb a:hover color:!important;}\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t.yuzo_related_post .relatedthumb:hover a color:!important;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t.yuzo_related_post .yuzo_text color:!important;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t.yuzo_related_post .relatedthumb:hover .yuzo_text color:!important;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t.yuzo_related_post .relatedthumb  margin: 0px  0px  0px  0px;   padding: 5px  5px  5px  5px;  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><a href=\"#\"><img src=\"https://assets.tumblr.com/images/inline_placeholder.png\" width=\"18\" height=\"14\"/></a></p></p></blockquote></p>",

For example, in humans, genes for digestion are more active earlier in the day while genes for cellular repair are more active at night. Previously, the Panda lab discovered that mice allowed 24-hour access to a high-fat diet became obese and developed a slew of metabolic diseases including high cholesterol, fatty liver and diabetes. But these same mice, when restricted to the high-fat diet for a daily 8- to 10-hour window became lean, fit and healthy. The lab attributed the health benefits to keeping the mice in better sync with their cellular clocks &ndash; for example, by eating most of the calories when genes for digestion were more active.</p><p>In the current study, the team aimed to better understand the role of circadian rhythms in metabolic diseases by disabling genes responsible for maintaining the biological clock in mice, including in the liver, which regulates many metabolic functions. The genetic defects in these clock-less mice make them prone to obesity, diabetes, fatty liver disease and elevated blood cholesterol. These diseases further escalate when the animals are allowed to eat fatty and sugary food.</p><p>To test whether time-restricted eating could benefit these &ldquo;clock-less&rdquo; mice, Panda&rsquo;s team put them on one of two high-fat diet regimes: one group had access to food around the clock, the other had access to the same number of calories only during a 10-hour window. As the team expected, the group that could eat at any time became obese and developed metabolic diseases. But the group that ate the same number of calories within a 10-hour window remained lean and healthy &ndash; despite not having an internal &ldquo;biological clock&rdquo; and thereby genetically programmed to be morbidly sick. This told the researchers that the health benefits from a 10-hour window were not just due to restricting eating to times when genes for digestion were more active.</p><p>&ldquo;From the previous study, we had been under the impression that the biological clock was internally timing the process of turning genes for metabolism on and off at predetermined times,&rdquo; says Amandine Chaix, a staff scientist at Salk and the paper&rsquo;s first author. &ldquo;And while that may still be true, this work suggests that by controlling the animals&rsquo; feeding and fasting cycles, we can basically override the lack of an internal timing system with an external timing system.&rdquo;</p><p>According to the researchers, the new work suggests that the primary role of circadian clocks may be to tell the animal when to eat and when to stay away from food. This internal timing strikes a balance between sufficient nutrition during the fed state and necessary repair or rejuvenation during fasting. When this circadian clock is disrupted, as when humans do shift work, or when it is compromised due to genetic defects, the balance between nutrition and rejuvenation breaks down and diseases set in.</p><p>As we age, our circadian clocks weaken. This age-dependent deterioration of circadian clock parallels our increased risk for metabolic diseases, heart diseases, cancer and dementia.</p><p>But the good news, say the researchers, is that a simple lifestyle such as eating all food within 10 hours can restore balance, stave off metabolic diseases and maintain health. &ldquo;Many of us may have one or more disease-causing defective genes that make us feel helpless and destined to be sick. The finding that a good lifestyle can beat the bad effects of defective genes opens new hope to stay healthy,&rdquo; says Panda.</p><p>The lab next plans to study whether eating within 8-10 hours can prevent or reverse many diseases of aging, as well as looking at how the current study could apply to humans.

For example, in humans, genes for digestion are more active earlier in the day while genes for cellular repair are more active at night. Previously, the Panda lab discovered that mice allowed 24-hour access to a high-fat diet became obese and developed a slew of metabolic diseases including high cholesterol, fatty liver and diabetes. But these same mice, when restricted to the high-fat diet for a daily 8- to 10-hour window became lean, fit and healthy. The lab attributed the health benefits to keeping the mice in better sync with their cellular clocks &ndash; for example, by eating most of the calories when genes for digestion were more active.</p><p>In the current study, the team aimed to better understand the role of circadian rhythms in metabolic diseases by disabling genes responsible for maintaining the biological clock in mice, including in the liver, which regulates many metabolic functions. The genetic defects in these clock-less mice make them prone to obesity, diabetes, fatty liver disease and elevated blood cholesterol. These diseases further escalate when the animals are allowed to eat fatty and sugary food.</p><p>To test whether time-restricted eating could benefit these &ldquo;clock-less&rdquo; mice, Panda&rsquo;s team put them on one of two high-fat diet regimes: one group had access to food around the clock, the other had access to the same number of calories only during a 10-hour window. As the team expected, the group that could eat at any time became obese and developed metabolic diseases. But the group that ate the same number of calories within a 10-hour window remained lean and healthy &ndash; despite not having an internal &ldquo;biological clock&rdquo; and thereby genetically programmed to be morbidly sick. This told the researchers that the health benefits from a 10-hour window were not just due to restricting eating to times when genes for digestion were more active.</p><p>&ldquo;From the previous study, we had been under the impression that the biological clock was internally timing the process of turning genes for metabolism on and off at predetermined times,&rdquo; says Amandine Chaix, a staff scientist at Salk and the paper&rsquo;s first author. &ldquo;And while that may still be true, this work suggests that by controlling the animals&rsquo; feeding and fasting cycles, we can basically override the lack of an internal timing system with an external timing system.&rdquo;</p><p>According to the researchers, the new work suggests that the primary role of circadian clocks may be to tell the animal when to eat and when to stay away from food. This internal timing strikes a balance between sufficient nutrition during the fed state and necessary repair or rejuvenation during fasting. When this circadian clock is disrupted, as when humans do shift work, or when it is compromised due to genetic defects, the balance between nutrition and rejuvenation breaks down and diseases set in.</p><p>As we age, our circadian clocks weaken. This age-dependent deterioration of circadian clock parallels our increased risk for metabolic diseases, heart diseases, cancer and dementia.</p><p>But the good news, say the researchers, is that a simple lifestyle such as eating all food within 10 hours can restore balance, stave off metabolic diseases and maintain health. &ldquo;Many of us may have one or more disease-causing defective genes that make us feel helpless and destined to be sick. The finding that a good lifestyle can beat the bad effects of defective genes opens new hope to stay healthy,&rdquo; says Panda.</p><p>The lab next plans to study whether eating within 8-10 hours can prevent or reverse many diseases of aging, as well as looking at how the current study could apply to humans.
