The DJ was playing some indie pop song he didn\u2019t know. He walked over to Steve, a grin still spread over his face. \u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>Steve sighed, smiling back. \u201cI hate you,\u201d he mumbled.</p><p>\u201cCome on. You love me.\u201d He bumped his shoulder against Steve&rsquo;s.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lucky I do,\u201d Steve replied, finishing his punch and throwing out the cup.</p><p>They talked for a while. Maybe two or three songs later, <i>Perfect</i>, also by Ed Sheeran, started playing. Before Tony could begin shaking his ass, Steve held out a hand. \u201cMay I have this dance?\u201d</p><p>Tony blinked. \u201cI don\u2019t dance, Rogers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do now,\u201d Steve said, grabbing his hand and dragging him onto the dance floor.</p><p>Tony complained halfheartedly as he was pulled to the center of the gym, which was occupied by a few couples slow dancing close together.</p><p>Steve grinned. \u201cCome on,\u201d he said, positioning Tony\u2019s hands on his shoulders. Steve placed his own hands on Tony\u2019s waist.</p><p>\u201cI told you, I don\u2019t dance,\u201d Tony repeated. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll teach you.\u201d Steve said, chuckling as Tony\u2019s face turned a bright shade of red. He started leading, putting light pressure on Tony\u2019s waist to help him figure out where to go.</p><p>\u201cRight foot forward. Right foot right. Right foot back.

Eventually, she stood and walked over to Sharon giving her a dramatic bow. \u201cM\u2019lady,\u201d she said, grinning up at her girlfriend.</p><p>Sharon giggled and held out a hand so she could be lead to the dance floor. The song changed to <i>Put Your Head On My Shoulder</i>, by Paul Anka, and Nat lead Sharron through a slow waltz. Both girls were dancers, so their movements were effortless as they glided across the floor.</p><p>Tony looked up a short while later and saw the two dancers, who were obviously the best in the room. He bit his lip and turned to Steve before looking down at their feet. Tony struggled to match Steve\u2019s rhythm. Steve laughed, and realized that he thought it was a competition. \u201cHere,\u201d he said as he leaned in to whisper instructions and tips to Tony.</p><p>The song ended and Sharon and Nat won.

You love me.\u201d He bumped his shoulder against Steve\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lucky I do,\u201d Steve replied, finishing his punch and throwing out the cup.</p><p>They talked for a while. Maybe two or three songs later, <i>Perfect</i>, also by Ed Sheeran, started playing. Before Tony could begin shaking his ass, Steve held out a hand. \u201cMay I have this dance?\u201d</p><p>Tony blinked. \u201cI don\u2019t dance, Rogers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do now,\u201d Steve said, grabbing his hand and dragging him onto the dance floor.</p><p>Tony complained halfheartedly as he was pulled to the center of the gym, which was occupied by a few couples slow dancing close together.</p><p>Steve grinned. \u201cCome on,\u201d he said, positioning Tony\u2019s hands on his shoulders. Steve placed his own hands on Tony\u2019s waist.</p><p>\u201cI told you, I don\u2019t dance,\u201d Tony repeated. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll teach you.\u201d Steve said, chuckling as Tony\u2019s face turned a bright shade of red. He started leading, putting light pressure on Tony\u2019s waist to help him figure out where to go.</p><p>\u201cRight foot forward. Right foot right. Right foot back. Left foot left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, shit, I stepped on your foot-\u201c</p><p>\u201c-it\u2019s fine, just remember-\u201c</p><p>\u201c-<i>fuck</i>, I did it again, I can\u2019t-\u201c</p><p>\u201c-just focus, you can do it-\u201c</p><p>Throughout their mess of a dance, Nat was cheering them on, shouting things like \u201cWork it, Stark!\u201d and \u201cGo get \u2018em, Rogers!\u201d as Tony\u2019s face flushed deeper. Eventually, she stood and walked over to Sharon giving her a dramatic bow. \u201cM\u2019lady,\u201d she said, grinning up at her girlfriend.</p><p>Sharon giggled and held out a hand so she could be lead to the dance floor. The song changed to <i>Put Your Head On My Shoulder</i>, by Paul Anka, and Nat lead Sharron through a slow waltz. Both girls were dancers, so their movements were effortless as they glided across the floor.</p><p>Tony looked up a short while later and saw the two dancers, who were obviously the best in the room. He bit his lip and turned to Steve before looking down at their feet. Tony struggled to match Steve\u2019s rhythm. Steve laughed, and realized that he thought it was a competition. \u201cHere,\u201d he said as he leaned in to whisper instructions and tips to Tony.</p><p>The song ended and Sharon and Nat won. By far. No matter how hard Tony had tried, he couldn\u2019t quite keep up with Steve\u2019s pace. Sharon and Nat, however, understood each other\u2019s movements perfectly. It also helped that they had danced together before.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not fair,\u201d Tony grumbled as they walked back to the sidelines.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a competition, Tony,\u201d Steve hummed as he put an arm around the others waist. \u201cAnd besides, they\u2019re both dancers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, still. I wanted to win.\u201d Tony leaned into Steve and frowned up at him.</p><p>\u201cIt alright.\u201d Steve leaned down to kiss Tony\u2019s nose. \u201cYou won my heart.\u201d</p><p>The rest of the team laughed and \u2018awwed\u2019 as Tony hid his face in Steve\u2019s suit jacket, blushing brightly.</p><p>Things couldn\u2019t be better.</p>",

This boy is Howard Stark\u2019s\nson! Isn\u2019t that great?\u201d</p><p>The new information about the boy in his kitchen only seemed\nto cause a frown to reappear on his face again. Your father\ncouldn\u2019t care less who he was, all he was was a distraction in his daughter\u2019s\nlife. \u201cA big shot then?\u201d He asked curtly.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a real charmer love, go easy on him\u201d she smiled\npolitely at Tony, only for him to return the smile.</p><p>\u201cTony can I\u2019ve a word?\u201d You asked clearly unhappy with the\nsituation just as much as your father.</p><p>Besides, what on earth has he said to your mother to\nstop her from over-reacting over his presence?</p><p>\u201cWhy now, he\u2019s good where he is. We need to get to know this\nfriend of yours better right?\u201d Your dad stepped in yet again.</p><p>This was a nightmare, your parents were about to question\nevery little detail of Tony\u2019s existence. One thing was for sure, you definitely weren\u2019t going to get to go anywhere after all of this.</p><p>Reaching for your mother\u2019s hand, Tony decided to take hold of\nit in both of his giving it a light pat in a friendly manner. \u201cMrs. Y/L/N, I apologise, I didn\u2019t mean to offend any of you. I just thought that it\u2019d\nbe good manners for me to come in here in person and ask for your permission to\nbring your lovely daughter to the funfair.\u201d</p><p>Your mother seemed to soak up his act like a sponge. Your\ndad on the other hand not so much.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely not!\u201d Your dad huffed.</p><p>\u201cHoney, he\u2019s a good boy! Is anyone else going with the two\nof you Tony?\u201d Your mother continued, completely ignoring the look your father\nwas giving her.</p><p>\u201cOh absolutely ma'am\u201d he said sending her another one of his\nhandsome smiles.</p><p><i>What was he playing at?</i></p><p>\u201cOkay then, just make sure to have her back here no later\nthan 10:00\u201d</p><p>Your dad decided to let out another huff in disbelief but to\nno effect.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make sure she\u2019s in through the door before the clock\neven strikes ten\u201d he winked as he began to get up. Walking over to you he made sure to stop shortly to turn and\nlook at your parents one final time. \u201cThank you, it\u2019s been a pleasure to meet\nyou both\u201d</p><p>With your mouth slightly agape you couldn\u2019t believe that he\nmanaged to convince your parents, well your mother, to allow you to leave with\nhim just like that.</p><p>\u201cWell you\u2019re always welcome to come around\u201d your mother\nsmiled.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely not!\u201d Your father interjected, but your\nmother was quick to silence him with a displeased look.</p><p>\u201cGo on Y/N, have fun\u201d she encouraged.</p><p>Giving you one of his proud smirks, Tony nudged you to\nwalk with him towards the door.</p><p>Grabbing your jacket and a handbag you followed him out to\nhis car.</p><p><i>Oh you were definitely in for a lecture when you got back.</i></p><p>\u201cWhat the hell was all that about!?\u201d You shouted as you\nslammed the car door.</p><p>Tony simply started the car and began to move off before\nreplying. \u201cOh c'mon, I did you a favour. Now you can have guys over.\u201d</p><p>Fiddling with the strap from your bag you let out a long sigh. \u201cTony you made it worse, I\u2019m gonna be in so much trouble when I get back.\u201d</p><p>Looking over at you briefly he raised an eyebrow \u201cOh really?\nSeemed like your mother quite liked me\u201d</p><p>Ugh if it weren\u2019t for the fact that he was driving you\nwould\u2019ve punched him in the arm. Without a perfect comeback ready to snap back\nat him you decided to relax in your seat and stare out the window.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe that out of all the guys in the area, my\nparents had to meet you first\u201d you mumbled.</p><p>Snorting at your comment, he decided to ignore your dig at\nhim. Only he couldn\u2019t, within seconds it began to bug him.</p><p>\u201cSo what if I was the first? Unlike any of the other guys\nout there at least I wasn\u2019t afraid to try\u201d he retorted.</p><p>From his tone of voice, it seemed as if your words hurt him\nin a way. With a silence following after his comment, neither of you spoke\nagain for the rest of the journey until you finally reached the funfair.</p><p>Mumbling a quiet \u2018thanks\u2019 you got out of the car and began\nlooking out for your friends.\u00a0</p><p>Tony didn\u2019t get out of the car for a while, he\nseemed to be deeply in thought with his elbow resting against the door. He\nremained still in his seat, rubbing his face with his hand.</p><p>Within minutes you managed to find your friends, laughing\ntogether over something as they headed towards where you stood.</p><p>Seeing them close by in his mirrors, the young adult finally decided\nto get out of the car.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s everyone waiting for?\u201d Amber beamed. \u201cThe funfairs\nthat way\u201d she beckoned towards the entrance.</p><p>Not having to hear much else, Alex was quick to walk over to you and Amber linking your\narms in his own and leading you both towards the entrance. </p><p>You were ready to try and wriggle out of his link but decided to go with the flow\ninstead. As you were pulled along you gave a quick glance back over your\nshoulder to look at Tony, who walked silently beside Josh and Kyle. </p><p><i>You really must\u2019ve struck a nerve with him.</i></p><p>Grabbing your tickets, you stopped shortly after the main\nentrance, allowing everyone to catch up with you. \u00a0Taking in all the attractions you weren\u2019t even\nsure where to start. </p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019d you wanna try first?\u201d Josh asked nudging you out\nof your daydream state. </p><p>However, before you even had the chance to respond, you were\nalready being dragged away yet again, this time by Jay.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNah ah we get her\nfirst. C\u2019mon Y/N\u201d Amber remarked.</p><p>The three of you headed towards the bumper cars first for a\nsimple beginning to an entire evening of fun. Handing in your ticket you went in to\nsit in the first car closest to you. The other two girls got into theirs, competitive\nfaces already surfacing. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going down Y/L/N!\u201d Amber laughed. </p><p>You squinted your eyes at her, only to send her a slight\nsmile afterwards. \u201cTry me!\u201d </p><p>Within seconds you were ready to go. At first you began by\ngathering speed and making sharp turns only to crash with all the force you\u2019ve managed\nto gather into either one of your friends. The atmosphere was quick to fill\nwith random shrieks and fits of laughter as the three of you continued in your\ntask of clashing against the other. At some stages when you were ready to put\nyour tactic in place they\u2019ve managed to throw you completely off-guard sending\nyou out to crash against other bumper cars. </p><p>Laughing away, you continued your mini-fight until the cars\nbegan slowing down indicating that the time was up. Standing up from the car,\nyour leg got slightly caught up as you tried to get out causing you to trip up,\nearning yet another fit of giggles from your friends. </p><p>\u201cThat was planned\u201d you reassured them, giggling along. </p><p>Walking beside the girls, your next stop was a mirror maze.\nThe building in which it was held was rather small and you questioned whether\nit was worth using up your ticket on. Of course, they were quick to convince you\nyet again.</p><p>Heading in, the room seemed a little dark at first but the\npath was lit up well enough for you to see where you were going. The first ten\nminutes were all fun and games as you were sure you were headed the right way\nonly to walk into a mirror end each time. After that, things were beginning to\nget a little claustrophobic. </p><p>\u201cEh girls, I got another dead end\u201d you spoke up, unsure of\nwhere you were seeing your friends. </p><p>\u201cTry walking towards me, we can try to figure it out\ntogether\u201d Jay replied. </p><p>Walking around you kept trying to reach your hand out to\nwherever you thought you saw Jordyn only to hit your hand against a mirror each\ntime. Deeply concentrated on finding your friend you almost screamed when you felt\nsomething grab hold of your shoulder.</p><p>\u201cChill, it\u2019s only me\u201d Jay laughed. </p><p>Taking a deep breath in and out you were ready to keep\ngoing. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure we\u2019re walking around in circles.\u201d You eventually\nuttered with worry evident in your voice.</p><p>\u201cSay, Amber\u2019s been quiet\u201d </p><p>A short moment of silence followed until the voice of your\nthird friend filled the small room. </p><p>\u201cI found the exit!!!\u201d she squeaked excitedly. </p><p>Jay and you were quick to snap into focus, trying to identify where your friend could possibly be standing. \u201cAmber where are you?!\u201d you\ncalled, continuing to feel mirrors as you walked on. </p><p>\u201cOver here!\u201d she shouted back. </p><p>Jay soon grabbed onto your sleeve and led you behind her.\nShe seemed to be onto something.</p><p>\u201cKeep talking Amber! I think we\u2019re close\u201d Jay called out as\nshe kept moving.</p><p>It took you another ten minutes until you finally managed to\nreach Amber, but with the fresh air of the outside hitting your face you couldn\u2019t\nbe more thankful to be finally out of that small building. </p><p>Taking deep breaths of the fresh air, the three of you\ncontinued to make your way around the funfair, only to be met with the guys\nagain.</p><p>\u201cWould you look who it is\u201d Kyle laughed as they reached you.\n</p><p>\u201cLemme guess, obstacle course?\u201d Alex grinned.</p><p>You shook your head in response. \u201cA mirror maze, don\u2019t be\nmisled by the building.\u201d</p><p>The two guys just looked at each other with Alex slightly\nraising his eyebrow in a questioning manor, only for Kyle to shrug in response.</p><p>\u201cWe were just heading to the roller-coaster at the back,\nwanna join?\u201d Josh asked stepping closer.</p><p>Agreeing to join, you all made your way down towards the\nroller-coaster. Standing in front of the structure you had to admit that you\nfelt somewhat nervous at the sight of how tall it actually was up close. </p><p>With the nerves in place, you were the last one out of your\nfriends to take a seat in one of the carts, only to realise that the only\nperson left without anyone sitting beside him was Tony. If it weren\u2019t for the\nfact that you were uncomfortable to sit on your own, you would\u2019ve sat elsewhere since your little disagreement.</p><p>Sitting in awkwardly beside him, you tried to keep a little room\nbetween the two of you. </p><p>With your safety belts fastened, and a safety bar clicked in\nplace the carts began to move slowly. As it moved slowly upwards, Tony could\ntell that you were beginning to feel anxious. Without saying anything to you he\ngrabbed your hand in his to ease your worries. </p><p>You glanced at your hand in his a little surprised. It was\nsuch a simple yet caring gesture. </p><p>Feeling your cheeks heat up you decided to sneak a look at\nhim, only to see him send you a reassuring smile, giving your hand a gentle squeeze\nbefore the carts reached the tipping point. </p><p>It was a strange feeling but you went along with it, only tightening your grip with the fear that followed on the way down the tracks. </p><p>During that entire ride, he didn\u2019t let go of your hand once.\nIf anything, your fear seemed to keep him quite entertained as you finally loosened\nup your muscles allowing your side to comfortably touch against his. </p><p>With the ride coming to an end, everyone was quick to hop\nout except for you. You remained sitting still trying to process everything\nthat just happened. </p><p>Tony just grinned leaning into your side. \u201cYou can let go of\nmy hand now sunshine\u201d </p><p>Upon realising that you were still holding onto it, you were\nquick to release his hand from your grip.

This boy is Howard Stark\u2019s\nson! Isn\u2019t that great?\u201d</p><p>The new information about the boy in his kitchen only seemed\nto cause a frown to reappear on his face again. Your father\ncouldn\u2019t care less who he was, all he was was a distraction in his daughter\u2019s\nlife. \u201cA big shot then?\u201d He asked curtly.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a real charmer love, go easy on him\u201d she smiled\npolitely at Tony, only for him to return the smile.</p><p>\u201cTony can I\u2019ve a word?\u201d You asked clearly unhappy with the\nsituation just as much as your father.</p><p>Besides, what on earth has he said to your mother to\nstop her from over-reacting over his presence?</p><p>\u201cWhy now, he\u2019s good where he is. We need to get to know this\nfriend of yours better right?\u201d Your dad stepped in yet again.</p><p>This was a nightmare, your parents were about to question\nevery little detail of Tony\u2019s existence. One thing was for sure, you definitely weren\u2019t going to get to go anywhere after all of this.</p><p>Reaching for your mother\u2019s hand, Tony decided to take hold of\nit in both of his giving it a light pat in a friendly manner. \u201cMrs. Y/L/N, I apologise, I didn\u2019t mean to offend any of you. I just thought that it\u2019d\nbe good manners for me to come in here in person and ask for your permission to\nbring your lovely daughter to the funfair.\u201d</p><p>Your mother seemed to soak up his act like a sponge. Your\ndad on the other hand not so much.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely not!\u201d Your dad huffed.</p><p>\u201cHoney, he\u2019s a good boy! Is anyone else going with the two\nof you Tony?\u201d Your mother continued, completely ignoring the look your father\nwas giving her.</p><p>\u201cOh absolutely ma'am\u201d he said sending her another one of his\nhandsome smiles.</p><p><i>What was he playing at?</i></p><p>\u201cOkay then, just make sure to have her back here no later\nthan 10:00\u201d</p><p>Your dad decided to let out another huff in disbelief but to\nno effect.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make sure she\u2019s in through the door before the clock\neven strikes ten\u201d he winked as he began to get up. Walking over to you he made sure to stop shortly to turn and\nlook at your parents one final time. \u201cThank you, it\u2019s been a pleasure to meet\nyou both\u201d</p><p>With your mouth slightly agape you couldn\u2019t believe that he\nmanaged to convince your parents, well your mother, to allow you to leave with\nhim just like that.</p><p>\u201cWell you\u2019re always welcome to come around\u201d your mother\nsmiled.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely not!\u201d Your father interjected, but your\nmother was quick to silence him with a displeased look.</p><p>\u201cGo on Y/N, have fun\u201d she encouraged.</p><p>Giving you one of his proud smirks, Tony nudged you to\nwalk with him towards the door.</p><p>Grabbing your jacket and a handbag you followed him out to\nhis car.</p><p><i>Oh you were definitely in for a lecture when you got back.</i></p><p>\u201cWhat the hell was all that about!?\u201d You shouted as you\nslammed the car door.</p><p>Tony simply started the car and began to move off before\nreplying. \u201cOh c'mon, I did you a favour. Now you can have guys over.\u201d</p><p>Fiddling with the strap from your bag you let out a long sigh. \u201cTony you made it worse, I\u2019m gonna be in so much trouble when I get back.\u201d</p><p>Looking over at you briefly he raised an eyebrow \u201cOh really?\nSeemed like your mother quite liked me\u201d</p><p>Ugh if it weren\u2019t for the fact that he was driving you\nwould\u2019ve punched him in the arm. Without a perfect comeback ready to snap back\nat him you decided to relax in your seat and stare out the window.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe that out of all the guys in the area, my\nparents had to meet you first\u201d you mumbled.</p><p>Snorting at your comment, he decided to ignore your dig at\nhim. Only he couldn\u2019t, within seconds it began to bug him.</p><p>\u201cSo what if I was the first? Unlike any of the other guys\nout there at least I wasn\u2019t afraid to try\u201d he retorted.</p><p>From his tone of voice, it seemed as if your words hurt him\nin a way. With a silence following after his comment, neither of you spoke\nagain for the rest of the journey until you finally reached the funfair.</p><p>Mumbling a quiet \u2018thanks\u2019 you got out of the car and began\nlooking out for your friends.\u00a0</p><p>Tony didn\u2019t get out of the car for a while, he\nseemed to be deeply in thought with his elbow resting against the door. He\nremained still in his seat, rubbing his face with his hand.</p><p>Within minutes you managed to find your friends, laughing\ntogether over something as they headed towards where you stood.</p><p>Seeing them close by in his mirrors, the young adult finally decided\nto get out of the car.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s everyone waiting for?\u201d Amber beamed. \u201cThe funfairs\nthat way\u201d she beckoned towards the entrance.</p><p>Not having to hear much else, Alex was quick to walk over to you and Amber linking your\narms in his own and leading you both towards the entrance. </p><p>You were ready to try and wriggle out of his link but decided to go with the flow\ninstead. As you were pulled along you gave a quick glance back over your\nshoulder to look at Tony, who walked silently beside Josh and Kyle. </p><p><i>You really must\u2019ve struck a nerve with him.</i></p><p>Grabbing your tickets, you stopped shortly after the main\nentrance, allowing everyone to catch up with you. \u00a0Taking in all the attractions you weren\u2019t even\nsure where to start. </p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019d you wanna try first?\u201d Josh asked nudging you out\nof your daydream state. </p><p>However, before you even had the chance to respond, you were\nalready being dragged away yet again, this time by Jay.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNah ah we get her\nfirst. C\u2019mon Y/N\u201d Amber remarked.</p><p>The three of you headed towards the bumper cars first for a\nsimple beginning to an entire evening of fun. Handing in your ticket you went in to\nsit in the first car closest to you. The other two girls got into theirs, competitive\nfaces already surfacing. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going down Y/L/N!\u201d Amber laughed. </p><p>You squinted your eyes at her, only to send her a slight\nsmile afterwards. \u201cTry me!\u201d </p><p>Within seconds you were ready to go. At first you began by\ngathering speed and making sharp turns only to crash with all the force you\u2019ve managed\nto gather into either one of your friends. The atmosphere was quick to fill\nwith random shrieks and fits of laughter as the three of you continued in your\ntask of clashing against the other. At some stages when you were ready to put\nyour tactic in place they\u2019ve managed to throw you completely off-guard sending\nyou out to crash against other bumper cars. </p><p>Laughing away, you continued your mini-fight until the cars\nbegan slowing down indicating that the time was up. Standing up from the car,\nyour leg got slightly caught up as you tried to get out causing you to trip up,\nearning yet another fit of giggles from your friends. </p><p>\u201cThat was planned\u201d you reassured them, giggling along. </p><p>Walking beside the girls, your next stop was a mirror maze.\nThe building in which it was held was rather small and you questioned whether\nit was worth using up your ticket on. Of course, they were quick to convince you\nyet again.</p><p>Heading in, the room seemed a little dark at first but the\npath was lit up well enough for you to see where you were going. The first ten\nminutes were all fun and games as you were sure you were headed the right way\nonly to walk into a mirror end each time. After that, things were beginning to\nget a little claustrophobic. </p><p>\u201cEh girls, I got another dead end\u201d you spoke up, unsure of\nwhere you were seeing your friends. </p><p>\u201cTry walking towards me, we can try to figure it out\ntogether\u201d Jay replied. </p><p>Walking around you kept trying to reach your hand out to\nwherever you thought you saw Jordyn only to hit your hand against a mirror each\ntime. Deeply concentrated on finding your friend you almost screamed when you felt\nsomething grab hold of your shoulder.</p><p>\u201cChill, it\u2019s only me\u201d Jay laughed. </p><p>Taking a deep breath in and out you were ready to keep\ngoing. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure we\u2019re walking around in circles.\u201d You eventually\nuttered with worry evident in your voice.</p><p>\u201cSay, Amber\u2019s been quiet\u201d </p><p>A short moment of silence followed until the voice of your\nthird friend filled the small room. </p><p>\u201cI found the exit!!!\u201d she squeaked excitedly. </p><p>Jay and you were quick to snap into focus, trying to identify where your friend could possibly be standing. \u201cAmber where are you?!\u201d you\ncalled, continuing to feel mirrors as you walked on. </p><p>\u201cOver here!\u201d she shouted back. </p><p>Jay soon grabbed onto your sleeve and led you behind her.\nShe seemed to be onto something.</p><p>\u201cKeep talking Amber! I think we\u2019re close\u201d Jay called out as\nshe kept moving.</p><p>It took you another ten minutes until you finally managed to\nreach Amber, but with the fresh air of the outside hitting your face you couldn\u2019t\nbe more thankful to be finally out of that small building. </p><p>Taking deep breaths of the fresh air, the three of you\ncontinued to make your way around the funfair, only to be met with the guys\nagain.</p><p>\u201cWould you look who it is\u201d Kyle laughed as they reached you.\n</p><p>\u201cLemme guess, obstacle course?\u201d Alex grinned.</p><p>You shook your head in response. \u201cA mirror maze, don\u2019t be\nmisled by the building.\u201d</p><p>The two guys just looked at each other with Alex slightly\nraising his eyebrow in a questioning manor, only for Kyle to shrug in response.</p><p>\u201cWe were just heading to the roller-coaster at the back,\nwanna join?\u201d Josh asked stepping closer.</p><p>Agreeing to join, you all made your way down towards the\nroller-coaster. Standing in front of the structure you had to admit that you\nfelt somewhat nervous at the sight of how tall it actually was up close. </p><p>With the nerves in place, you were the last one out of your\nfriends to take a seat in one of the carts, only to realise that the only\nperson left without anyone sitting beside him was Tony. If it weren\u2019t for the\nfact that you were uncomfortable to sit on your own, you would\u2019ve sat elsewhere since your little disagreement.</p><p>Sitting in awkwardly beside him, you tried to keep a little room\nbetween the two of you. </p><p>With your safety belts fastened, and a safety bar clicked in\nplace the carts began to move slowly. As it moved slowly upwards, Tony could\ntell that you were beginning to feel anxious. Without saying anything to you he\ngrabbed your hand in his to ease your worries. </p><p>You glanced at your hand in his a little surprised. It was\nsuch a simple yet caring gesture. </p><p>Feeling your cheeks heat up you decided to sneak a look at\nhim, only to see him send you a reassuring smile, giving your hand a gentle squeeze\nbefore the carts reached the tipping point. </p><p>It was a strange feeling but you went along with it, only tightening your grip with the fear that followed on the way down the tracks. </p><p>During that entire ride, he didn\u2019t let go of your hand once.\nIf anything, your fear seemed to keep him quite entertained as you finally loosened\nup your muscles allowing your side to comfortably touch against his. </p><p>With the ride coming to an end, everyone was quick to hop\nout except for you. You remained sitting still trying to process everything\nthat just happened. </p><p>Tony just grinned leaning into your side. \u201cYou can let go of\nmy hand now sunshine\u201d </p><p>Upon realising that you were still holding onto it, you were\nquick to release his hand from your grip. Feeling yet another blush coming\nalong, you hurried after your friends. </p><p>Ignoring Amber\u2019s teasing look, you decided to stand beside\nJosh instead.</p><p>\u201cMan, you should\u2019ve seen Jordy\u201d Alex laughed, nudging the\ndark-haired girl earning an eye-roll in return. </p><p>A little embarrassed by your own fear earlier on you decided\nto quickly suggest toning it down a little with some ice-cream or so. It didn\u2019t\ntake much convincing for some of your friends to tag along with you. Kyle and\nAlex on the other hand told you they\u2019d re-join all of you later after another\nadrenaline filled attraction.</p><p>You were more than happy to allow them to go on their own. </p><p>Walking behind everyone else towards the treats booth, you\nnoticed Tony looking back at you every now and then. It almost seemed as if he\nwere debating whether to go back over to you and talk. </p><p>Josh was quick to beat him to it though. </p><p>\u201cHeyy you\u201d </p><p>Raising an eyebrow you responded with a soft giggle \u201cuh hey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSlow down a lil, I gotta talk to you\u201d </p><p>Slowing down your pace, you allowed distance to build up\nbetween you and the rest of the group. Hundreds of questions began to fill your\nmind in the process. What did he want to talk to you about? Was he going to make a move on you? Was it actually Josh\nwho had the crush on you all along? </p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d</p><p>Looking over at the group in the distance he decided to stop\nin his tracks, only to turn his attention back to you. Taking a step closer to you he decided\nto lean in to whisper just slightly above you ear.</p><p>\u201cI was thinking\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u2026\u201d you asked remaining still, trying to keep your\nbreath even at how close he was.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve always been really close Y/N ever since I met you,\nand we certainly make a great team..\u201d he continued. \u201c\u2026 and I know that you know about\nthe bet\u2026\u201d </p><p><i>What a snake!</i></p><p>Waking from your daydream you were quick to push him back slightly.

We need to get to know this\nfriend of yours better right?\u201d Your dad stepped in yet again.</p><p>This was a nightmare, your parents were about to question\nevery little detail of Tony\u2019s existence. One thing was for sure, you definitely weren\u2019t going to get to go anywhere after all of this.</p><p>Reaching for your mother\u2019s hand, Tony decided to take hold of\nit in both of his giving it a light pat in a friendly manner. \u201cMrs. Y/L/N, I apologise, I didn\u2019t mean to offend any of you. I just thought that it\u2019d\nbe good manners for me to come in here in person and ask for your permission to\nbring your lovely daughter to the funfair.\u201d</p><p>Your mother seemed to soak up his act like a sponge.

Is anyone else going with the two\nof you Tony?\u201d Your mother continued, completely ignoring the look your father\nwas giving her.</p><p>\u201cOh absolutely ma'am\u201d he said sending her another one of his\nhandsome smiles.</p><p><i>What was he playing at?</i></p><p>\u201cOkay then, just make sure to have her back here no later\nthan 10:00\u201d</p><p>Your dad decided to let out another huff in disbelief but to\nno effect.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make sure she\u2019s in through the door before the clock\neven strikes ten\u201d he winked as he began to get up.

Now you can have guys over.\u201d</p><p>Fiddling with the strap from your bag you let out a long sigh. \u201cTony you made it worse, I\u2019m gonna be in so much trouble when I get back.\u201d</p><p>Looking over at you briefly he raised an eyebrow \u201cOh really?\nSeemed like your mother quite liked me\u201d</p><p>Ugh if it weren\u2019t for the fact that he was driving you\nwould\u2019ve punched him in the arm. Without a perfect comeback ready to snap back\nat him you decided to relax in your seat and stare out the window.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe that out of all the guys in the area, my\nparents had to meet you first\u201d you mumbled.</p><p>Snorting at your comment, he decided to ignore your dig at\nhim. Only he couldn\u2019t, within seconds it began to bug him.</p><p>\u201cSo what if I was the first? Unlike any of the other guys\nout there at least I wasn\u2019t afraid to try\u201d he retorted.</p><p>From his tone of voice, it seemed as if your words hurt him\nin a way. With a silence following after his comment, neither of you spoke\nagain for the rest of the journey until you finally reached the funfair.</p><p>Mumbling a quiet \u2018thanks\u2019 you got out of the car and began\nlooking out for your friends.\u00a0</p><p>Tony didn\u2019t get out of the car for a while, he\nseemed to be deeply in thought with his elbow resting against the door. He\nremained still in his seat, rubbing his face with his hand.</p><p>Within minutes you managed to find your friends, laughing\ntogether over something as they headed towards where you stood.</p><p>Seeing them close by in his mirrors, the young adult finally decided\nto get out of the car.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s everyone waiting for?\u201d Amber beamed. \u201cThe funfairs\nthat way\u201d she beckoned towards the entrance.</p><p>Not having to hear much else, Alex was quick to walk over to you and Amber linking your\narms in his own and leading you both towards the entrance. </p><p>You were ready to try and wriggle out of his link but decided to go with the flow\ninstead. As you were pulled along you gave a quick glance back over your\nshoulder to look at Tony, who walked silently beside Josh and Kyle. </p><p><i>You really must\u2019ve struck a nerve with him.</i></p><p>Grabbing your tickets, you stopped shortly after the main\nentrance, allowing everyone to catch up with you. \u00a0Taking in all the attractions you weren\u2019t even\nsure where to start. </p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019d you wanna try first?\u201d Josh asked nudging you out\nof your daydream state. </p><p>However, before you even had the chance to respond, you were\nalready being dragged away yet again, this time by Jay.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNah ah we get her\nfirst. C\u2019mon Y/N\u201d Amber remarked.</p><p>The three of you headed towards the bumper cars first for a\nsimple beginning to an entire evening of fun. Handing in your ticket you went in to\nsit in the first car closest to you. The other two girls got into theirs, competitive\nfaces already surfacing. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going down Y/L/N!\u201d Amber laughed. </p><p>You squinted your eyes at her, only to send her a slight\nsmile afterwards. \u201cTry me!\u201d </p><p>Within seconds you were ready to go. At first you began by\ngathering speed and making sharp turns only to crash with all the force you\u2019ve managed\nto gather into either one of your friends. The atmosphere was quick to fill\nwith random shrieks and fits of laughter as the three of you continued in your\ntask of clashing against the other. At some stages when you were ready to put\nyour tactic in place they\u2019ve managed to throw you completely off-guard sending\nyou out to crash against other bumper cars. </p><p>Laughing away, you continued your mini-fight until the cars\nbegan slowing down indicating that the time was up. Standing up from the car,\nyour leg got slightly caught up as you tried to get out causing you to trip up,\nearning yet another fit of giggles from your friends. </p><p>\u201cThat was planned\u201d you reassured them, giggling along. </p><p>Walking beside the girls, your next stop was a mirror maze.\nThe building in which it was held was rather small and you questioned whether\nit was worth using up your ticket on. Of course, they were quick to convince you\nyet again.</p><p>Heading in, the room seemed a little dark at first but the\npath was lit up well enough for you to see where you were going. The first ten\nminutes were all fun and games as you were sure you were headed the right way\nonly to walk into a mirror end each time. After that, things were beginning to\nget a little claustrophobic. </p><p>\u201cEh girls, I got another dead end\u201d you spoke up, unsure of\nwhere you were seeing your friends. </p><p>\u201cTry walking towards me, we can try to figure it out\ntogether\u201d Jay replied. </p><p>Walking around you kept trying to reach your hand out to\nwherever you thought you saw Jordyn only to hit your hand against a mirror each\ntime. Deeply concentrated on finding your friend you almost screamed when you felt\nsomething grab hold of your shoulder.</p><p>\u201cChill, it\u2019s only me\u201d Jay laughed. </p><p>Taking a deep breath in and out you were ready to keep\ngoing. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure we\u2019re walking around in circles.\u201d You eventually\nuttered with worry evident in your voice.</p><p>\u201cSay, Amber\u2019s been quiet\u201d </p><p>A short moment of silence followed until the voice of your\nthird friend filled the small room. </p><p>\u201cI found the exit!!!\u201d she squeaked excitedly. </p><p>Jay and you were quick to snap into focus, trying to identify where your friend could possibly be standing. \u201cAmber where are you?!\u201d you\ncalled, continuing to feel mirrors as you walked on. </p><p>\u201cOver here!\u201d she shouted back. </p><p>Jay soon grabbed onto your sleeve and led you behind her.\nShe seemed to be onto something.</p><p>\u201cKeep talking Amber! I think we\u2019re close\u201d Jay called out as\nshe kept moving.</p><p>It took you another ten minutes until you finally managed to\nreach Amber, but with the fresh air of the outside hitting your face you couldn\u2019t\nbe more thankful to be finally out of that small building. </p><p>Taking deep breaths of the fresh air, the three of you\ncontinued to make your way around the funfair, only to be met with the guys\nagain.</p><p>\u201cWould you look who it is\u201d Kyle laughed as they reached you.\n</p><p>\u201cLemme guess, obstacle course?\u201d Alex grinned.</p><p>You shook your head in response. \u201cA mirror maze, don\u2019t be\nmisled by the building.\u201d</p><p>The two guys just looked at each other with Alex slightly\nraising his eyebrow in a questioning manor, only for Kyle to shrug in response.</p><p>\u201cWe were just heading to the roller-coaster at the back,\nwanna join?\u201d Josh asked stepping closer.</p><p>Agreeing to join, you all made your way down towards the\nroller-coaster. Standing in front of the structure you had to admit that you\nfelt somewhat nervous at the sight of how tall it actually was up close. </p><p>With the nerves in place, you were the last one out of your\nfriends to take a seat in one of the carts, only to realise that the only\nperson left without anyone sitting beside him was Tony. If it weren\u2019t for the\nfact that you were uncomfortable to sit on your own, you would\u2019ve sat elsewhere since your little disagreement.</p><p>Sitting in awkwardly beside him, you tried to keep a little room\nbetween the two of you. </p><p>With your safety belts fastened, and a safety bar clicked in\nplace the carts began to move slowly. As it moved slowly upwards, Tony could\ntell that you were beginning to feel anxious. Without saying anything to you he\ngrabbed your hand in his to ease your worries. </p><p>You glanced at your hand in his a little surprised. It was\nsuch a simple yet caring gesture. </p><p>Feeling your cheeks heat up you decided to sneak a look at\nhim, only to see him send you a reassuring smile, giving your hand a gentle squeeze\nbefore the carts reached the tipping point. </p><p>It was a strange feeling but you went along with it, only tightening your grip with the fear that followed on the way down the tracks. </p><p>During that entire ride, he didn\u2019t let go of your hand once.\nIf anything, your fear seemed to keep him quite entertained as you finally loosened\nup your muscles allowing your side to comfortably touch against his. </p><p>With the ride coming to an end, everyone was quick to hop\nout except for you. You remained sitting still trying to process everything\nthat just happened. </p><p>Tony just grinned leaning into your side. \u201cYou can let go of\nmy hand now sunshine\u201d </p><p>Upon realising that you were still holding onto it, you were\nquick to release his hand from your grip. Feeling yet another blush coming\nalong, you hurried after your friends. </p><p>Ignoring Amber\u2019s teasing look, you decided to stand beside\nJosh instead.</p><p>\u201cMan, you should\u2019ve seen Jordy\u201d Alex laughed, nudging the\ndark-haired girl earning an eye-roll in return. </p><p>A little embarrassed by your own fear earlier on you decided\nto quickly suggest toning it down a little with some ice-cream or so. It didn\u2019t\ntake much convincing for some of your friends to tag along with you. Kyle and\nAlex on the other hand told you they\u2019d re-join all of you later after another\nadrenaline filled attraction.</p><p>You were more than happy to allow them to go on their own. </p><p>Walking behind everyone else towards the treats booth, you\nnoticed Tony looking back at you every now and then. It almost seemed as if he\nwere debating whether to go back over to you and talk. </p><p>Josh was quick to beat him to it though. </p><p>\u201cHeyy you\u201d </p><p>Raising an eyebrow you responded with a soft giggle \u201cuh hey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSlow down a lil, I gotta talk to you\u201d </p><p>Slowing down your pace, you allowed distance to build up\nbetween you and the rest of the group. Hundreds of questions began to fill your\nmind in the process. What did he want to talk to you about? Was he going to make a move on you? Was it actually Josh\nwho had the crush on you all along? </p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d</p><p>Looking over at the group in the distance he decided to stop\nin his tracks, only to turn his attention back to you. Taking a step closer to you he decided\nto lean in to whisper just slightly above you ear.</p><p>\u201cI was thinking\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u2026\u201d you asked remaining still, trying to keep your\nbreath even at how close he was.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve always been really close Y/N ever since I met you,\nand we certainly make a great team..\u201d he continued. \u201c\u2026 and I know that you know about\nthe bet\u2026\u201d </p><p><i>What a snake!</i></p><p>Waking from your daydream you were quick to push him back slightly. Looking up at him, you proceeded to squint your eyes suspiciously. \u201cWho told you?\u201d </p><p>\u201cHey, easy. And you did, just now\u201d he smirked. </p><p>\u201cUgh, you\u2019re a jerk y\u2019know that?\u201d you groaned. \u201cWhat do you\nwant?\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh nothing, just help me win the bet\u201d</p><p>Taken aback by his request, you decided to take a short step away\nfrom him. </p><p>\u201cAre you for real? There\u2019s no way-\u201c\u00a0</p><p>\u201cConsider this, I can always tell them that you know. Besides,\nI also know who has a crush on you..\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t dare\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr would I?\u201d he smiled, winking at you.</p><hr><p><b>A/N: </b><i>OooOOOoooh dramaaaa.

Walking over to you he made sure to stop shortly to turn and\nlook at your parents one final time. &ldquo;Thank you, it&rsquo;s been a pleasure to meet\nyou both&rdquo;</p><p>With your mouth slightly agape you couldn&rsquo;t believe that he\nmanaged to convince your parents, well your mother, to allow you to leave with\nhim just like that.</p><p>&ldquo;Well you&rsquo;re always welcome to come around&rdquo; your mother\nsmiled.</p><p>&ldquo;Absolutely not!&rdquo; Your father interjected, but your\nmother was quick to silence him with a displeased look.</p><p>&ldquo;Go on Y/N, have fun&rdquo; she encouraged.</p><p>Giving you one of his proud smirks, Tony nudged you to\nwalk with him towards the door.</p><p>Grabbing your jacket and a handbag you followed him out to\nhis car.</p><p><i>Oh you were definitely in for a lecture when you got back.</i></p><p>&ldquo;What the hell was all that about!?&rdquo; You shouted as you\nslammed the car door.</p><p>Tony simply started the car and began to move off before\nreplying. &ldquo;Oh c'mon, I did you a favour. Now you can have guys over.&rdquo;</p><p>Fiddling with the strap from your bag you let out a long sigh. &ldquo;Tony you made it worse, I&rsquo;m gonna be in so much trouble when I get back.&rdquo;</p><p>Looking over at you briefly he raised an eyebrow &ldquo;Oh really?\nSeemed like your mother quite liked me&rdquo;</p><p>Ugh if it weren&rsquo;t for the fact that he was driving you\nwould&rsquo;ve punched him in the arm. Without a perfect comeback ready to snap back\nat him you decided to relax in your seat and stare out the window.</p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe that out of all the guys in the area, my\nparents had to meet you first&rdquo; you mumbled.</p><p>Snorting at your comment, he decided to ignore your dig at\nhim. Only he couldn&rsquo;t, within seconds it began to bug him.</p><p>&ldquo;So what if I was the first? Unlike any of the other guys\nout there at least I wasn&rsquo;t afraid to try&rdquo; he retorted.</p><p>From his tone of voice, it seemed as if your words hurt him\nin a way. With a silence following after his comment, neither of you spoke\nagain for the rest of the journey until you finally reached the funfair.</p><p>Mumbling a quiet &lsquo;thanks&rsquo; you got out of the car and began\nlooking out for your friends.&nbsp;</p><p>Tony didn&rsquo;t get out of the car for a while, he\nseemed to be deeply in thought with his elbow resting against the door. He\nremained still in his seat, rubbing his face with his hand.</p><p>Within minutes you managed to find your friends, laughing\ntogether over something as they headed towards where you stood.</p><p>Seeing them close by in his mirrors, the young adult finally decided\nto get out of the car.</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s everyone waiting for?&rdquo; Amber beamed. &ldquo;The funfairs\nthat way&rdquo; she beckoned towards the entrance.</p><p>Not having to hear much else, Alex was quick to walk over to you and Amber linking your\narms in his own and leading you both towards the entrance. </p><p>You were ready to try and wriggle out of his link but decided to go with the flow\ninstead. As you were pulled along you gave a quick glance back over your\nshoulder to look at Tony, who walked silently beside Josh and Kyle. </p><p><i>You really must&rsquo;ve struck a nerve with him.</i></p><p>Grabbing your tickets, you stopped shortly after the main\nentrance, allowing everyone to catch up with you. &nbsp;Taking in all the attractions you weren&rsquo;t even\nsure where to start. </p><p>&ldquo;So what&rsquo;d you wanna try first?&rdquo; Josh asked nudging you out\nof your daydream state. </p><p>However, before you even had the chance to respond, you were\nalready being dragged away yet again, this time by Jay.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Nah ah we get her\nfirst. C&rsquo;mon Y/N&rdquo; Amber remarked.</p><p>The three of you headed towards the bumper cars first for a\nsimple beginning to an entire evening of fun. Handing in your ticket you went in to\nsit in the first car closest to you. The other two girls got into theirs, competitive\nfaces already surfacing. </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going down Y/L/N!&rdquo; Amber laughed. </p><p>You squinted your eyes at her, only to send her a slight\nsmile afterwards. &ldquo;Try me!&rdquo; </p><p>Within seconds you were ready to go. At first you began by\ngathering speed and making sharp turns only to crash with all the force you&rsquo;ve managed\nto gather into either one of your friends. The atmosphere was quick to fill\nwith random shrieks and fits of laughter as the three of you continued in your\ntask of clashing against the other. At some stages when you were ready to put\nyour tactic in place they&rsquo;ve managed to throw you completely off-guard sending\nyou out to crash against other bumper cars. </p><p>Laughing away, you continued your mini-fight until the cars\nbegan slowing down indicating that the time was up. Standing up from the car,\nyour leg got slightly caught up as you tried to get out causing you to trip up,\nearning yet another fit of giggles from your friends. </p><p>&ldquo;That was planned&rdquo; you reassured them, giggling along. </p><p>Walking beside the girls, your next stop was a mirror maze.\nThe building in which it was held was rather small and you questioned whether\nit was worth using up your ticket on. Of course, they were quick to convince you\nyet again.</p><p>Heading in, the room seemed a little dark at first but the\npath was lit up well enough for you to see where you were going. The first ten\nminutes were all fun and games as you were sure you were headed the right way\nonly to walk into a mirror end each time. After that, things were beginning to\nget a little claustrophobic. </p><p>&ldquo;Eh girls, I got another dead end&rdquo; you spoke up, unsure of\nwhere you were seeing your friends. </p><p>&ldquo;Try walking towards me, we can try to figure it out\ntogether&rdquo; Jay replied. </p><p>Walking around you kept trying to reach your hand out to\nwherever you thought you saw Jordyn only to hit your hand against a mirror each\ntime. Deeply concentrated on finding your friend you almost screamed when you felt\nsomething grab hold of your shoulder.</p><p>&ldquo;Chill, it&rsquo;s only me&rdquo; Jay laughed. </p><p>Taking a deep breath in and out you were ready to keep\ngoing. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m pretty sure we&rsquo;re walking around in circles.&rdquo; You eventually\nuttered with worry evident in your voice.</p><p>&ldquo;Say, Amber&rsquo;s been quiet&rdquo; </p><p>A short moment of silence followed until the voice of your\nthird friend filled the small room. </p><p>&ldquo;I found the exit!!!&rdquo; she squeaked excitedly. </p><p>Jay and you were quick to snap into focus, trying to identify where your friend could possibly be standing. &ldquo;Amber where are you?!&rdquo; you\ncalled, continuing to feel mirrors as you walked on. </p><p>&ldquo;Over here!&rdquo; she shouted back. </p><p>Jay soon grabbed onto your sleeve and led you behind her.\nShe seemed to be onto something.</p><p>&ldquo;Keep talking Amber! I think we&rsquo;re close&rdquo; Jay called out as\nshe kept moving.</p><p>It took you another ten minutes until you finally managed to\nreach Amber, but with the fresh air of the outside hitting your face you couldn&rsquo;t\nbe more thankful to be finally out of that small building. </p><p>Taking deep breaths of the fresh air, the three of you\ncontinued to make your way around the funfair, only to be met with the guys\nagain.</p><p>&ldquo;Would you look who it is&rdquo; Kyle laughed as they reached you.\n</p><p>&ldquo;Lemme guess, obstacle course?&rdquo; Alex grinned.</p><p>You shook your head in response. &ldquo;A mirror maze, don&rsquo;t be\nmisled by the building.&rdquo;</p><p>The two guys just looked at each other with Alex slightly\nraising his eyebrow in a questioning manor, only for Kyle to shrug in response.</p><p>&ldquo;We were just heading to the roller-coaster at the back,\nwanna join?&rdquo; Josh asked stepping closer.</p><p>Agreeing to join, you all made your way down towards the\nroller-coaster. Standing in front of the structure you had to admit that you\nfelt somewhat nervous at the sight of how tall it actually was up close. </p><p>With the nerves in place, you were the last one out of your\nfriends to take a seat in one of the carts, only to realise that the only\nperson left without anyone sitting beside him was Tony. If it weren&rsquo;t for the\nfact that you were uncomfortable to sit on your own, you would&rsquo;ve sat elsewhere since your little disagreement.</p><p>Sitting in awkwardly beside him, you tried to keep a little room\nbetween the two of you. </p><p>With your safety belts fastened, and a safety bar clicked in\nplace the carts began to move slowly. As it moved slowly upwards, Tony could\ntell that you were beginning to feel anxious. Without saying anything to you he\ngrabbed your hand in his to ease your worries. </p><p>You glanced at your hand in his a little surprised. It was\nsuch a simple yet caring gesture. </p><p>Feeling your cheeks heat up you decided to sneak a look at\nhim, only to see him send you a reassuring smile, giving your hand a gentle squeeze\nbefore the carts reached the tipping point. </p><p>It was a strange feeling but you went along with it, only tightening your grip with the fear that followed on the way down the tracks. </p><p>During that entire ride, he didn&rsquo;t let go of your hand once.\nIf anything, your fear seemed to keep him quite entertained as you finally loosened\nup your muscles allowing your side to comfortably touch against his. </p><p>With the ride coming to an end, everyone was quick to hop\nout except for you. You remained sitting still trying to process everything\nthat just happened. </p><p>Tony just grinned leaning into your side. &ldquo;You can let go of\nmy hand now sunshine&rdquo; </p><p>Upon realising that you were still holding onto it, you were\nquick to release his hand from your grip. Feeling yet another blush coming\nalong, you hurried after your friends. </p><p>Ignoring Amber&rsquo;s teasing look, you decided to stand beside\nJosh instead.</p><p>&ldquo;Man, you should&rsquo;ve seen Jordy&rdquo; Alex laughed, nudging the\ndark-haired girl earning an eye-roll in return. </p><p>A little embarrassed by your own fear earlier on you decided\nto quickly suggest toning it down a little with some ice-cream or so. It didn&rsquo;t\ntake much convincing for some of your friends to tag along with you. Kyle and\nAlex on the other hand told you they&rsquo;d re-join all of you later after another\nadrenaline filled attraction.</p><p>You were more than happy to allow them to go on their own. </p><p>Walking behind everyone else towards the treats booth, you\nnoticed Tony looking back at you every now and then. It almost seemed as if he\nwere debating whether to go back over to you and talk. </p><p>Josh was quick to beat him to it though. </p><p>&ldquo;Heyy you&rdquo; </p><p>Raising an eyebrow you responded with a soft giggle &ldquo;uh hey?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Slow down a lil, I gotta talk to you&rdquo; </p><p>Slowing down your pace, you allowed distance to build up\nbetween you and the rest of the group. Hundreds of questions began to fill your\nmind in the process. What did he want to talk to you about? Was he going to make a move on you? Was it actually Josh\nwho had the crush on you all along? </p><p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p><p>Looking over at the group in the distance he decided to stop\nin his tracks, only to turn his attention back to you. Taking a step closer to you he decided\nto lean in to whisper just slightly above you ear.</p><p>&ldquo;I was thinking&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah?&hellip;&rdquo; you asked remaining still, trying to keep your\nbreath even at how close he was.</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve always been really close Y/N ever since I met you,\nand we certainly make a great team..&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;&hellip; and I know that you know about\nthe bet&hellip;&rdquo; </p><p><i>What a snake!</i></p><p>Waking from your daydream you were quick to push him back slightly. Looking up at him, you proceeded to squint your eyes suspiciously. &ldquo;Who told you?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Hey, easy. And you did, just now&rdquo; he smirked. </p><p>&ldquo;Ugh, you&rsquo;re a jerk y&rsquo;know that?&rdquo; you groaned. &ldquo;What do you\nwant?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Oh nothing, just help me win the bet&rdquo;</p><p>Taken aback by his request, you decided to take a short step away\nfrom him. </p><p>&ldquo;Are you for real? There&rsquo;s no way-&ldquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Consider this, I can always tell them that you know. Besides,\nI also know who has a crush on you..&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t dare&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Or would I?&rdquo; he smiled, winking at you.</p><hr /><p><b>A/N: </b><i>OooOOOoooh dramaaaa.

I was just making sure you were on our side.\u201d Thor smirked \u201cLike you did with Ruby?\u201d Sam could only whisper, \u201cHow did you know that?\u201d Thor looked a little horrified \u201cHOW DID YOU KNOW THAT?!?!\u201d Sam shocked himself into yelling. \u201cA portal!\u201d Dr. Banner exclaimed from the other side of the room. \u201cThat\u2019s what he needs Selvig for.\u201d Sam realized out loud. \u201cSelvig?\u201d Thor questioned out loud. \u201cHe\u2019s an astrophysicist\u201d Dr. Banner replied easily.\u00a0\u201cHe\u2019s a friend.\u201d Thor stated. \u201cLoki has him under some sort of spell,\u201d Nat paused \u201calong with one of ours\u201d. The silence was broke by Steve \u201cI wanna know why Loki let us take him. He\u2019s not leading an army from here.\u201d Sam was still thinking of the Iridium, if used properly it could act as a stabilizing agent but also an enhancer! He was pulled out of his thought when Dr. Banner asked \u201cIridium though, what do they need Iridium for?\u201d Sam replied before he could stop himself \u201cIridium can work as a stabilizer and enhancer, If I based this hypothesis off of Selvig\u2019s team\u2019s note and the Extraction Theory than I\u2019m guessing he will find a way to stabilize the cube enough to break through the coulomb barrier from there he uses the Iridium as an enhancer.\u201d Dr. Banner than piped in \u201cBut to do that, they would have to heat the cube to twenty million Kelvin.\u201d Than Tony walked in saying \u201cUnless, Selvig figured out how to stabilize the quantum tunneling effect, which is where Sam\u2019s Iridium Theory comes in.\u201d Dr. Banner quickly replied worriedly \u201cWell, if he could do that he could achieve Heavy Ion Fusion at any reactor on the planet.\u201d Tony looked at Sam excitedly \u201cFinally someone who speaks English.\u201d \u201cIs that what just happened\u201d Steve had no clue what they were saying and Sam found it kind of funny. Tony stuck out his hand for Dr. Banner to shake, Sam did the same thing \u201cIt\u2019s good to meet you Dr. Banner. Your work on Anti-Electronic Collisions is unparalleled. And I\u2019m a huge fan of the way you lose control and turn into an enormous green rage monster.\u201d Sam rolled his eyes, count on Tony to make everything weird. Dr. Banner looked down and replied \u201cThanks\u201d Awkwardly. Nick Fury than spoke up \u201cDr. Banner is only here to track the cube. I was hoping you two might join him.\u201d Steve than chose that moment to join in. \u201cLet\u2019s start with that stick of his. It may be magical, but it works an awful lot like a hydra weapon\u201d which got Sam thinking. \u201cI don\u2019t know about that but it\u2019s powered by the cube.\u201d Sam doubted that the scepter has manipulated minds, controlled them. The cube has the ability to open a portal into space if the scepter was powered by the cube than it would have similar effects. Fury than continued \u201cAnd I\u2019d like to know how Loki used it to turn two of the sharpest men I know into his personal flying monkeys.\u201d Thor than got really confused. \u201cMonkeys? I do not understand.\u201d Steve than piped in \u201cI do! &hellip; I understood that reference.\u201d proud of himself basically hearing Tony\u2019s eye roll through his sigh.
