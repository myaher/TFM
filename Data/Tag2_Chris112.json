The streets were filled with merry strangers mingling with the always-hurrying\nworkers. Unknown faces that kept on moving all around, in one direction or the\nother. And in the centre of the busy city, Central Park was an oasis lost in a\ndesert.</p><p>Central Park was filled with\nlaziness and sunshine. Children played while their parents relaxed under the\nshadow of the trees. And through the park, the flowers coloured the alleys and\nfilled the air with sugary fragrances. </p><p>Everything felt sunny and\nhappy to you. But perhaps it was also the prospect of starting a new job that\nmade you this merry. </p><p>A three months job was\nawaiting you here in New York. The creation of a new movie was always exciting\nto you. It meant that you would bring a brand-new character to life. After all,\nit was the advantage of becoming an actress. </p><p>You would start this new job the\nnext day, and you had to admit that your excitement was tainted with\napprehension. It was always a strange mix of fear and excitement, to start a\nnew adventure. And because this next movie was a love story, you were even more\nnervous than usual. After all, if you couldn\u2019t get along with the actor playing\nyour love interest, everything would be harder.</p><p>You counted on Chris Evans&rsquo;s\nprofessionalism in any case. After all, he was talented and had a good\nreputation amongst actors. Everything would surely be just fine.</p><p>You crossed the street from\nthe edge of the park to the busy sidewalks that ran against the skyscrapers. An\nold man was selling hot dogs, when a few meters away, you could buy today\u2019s\nnewspapers. There was a strange excitation all around you, a dance of shorts\nand dresses and briefcases and suits. A mix of holidays and busy workers. But\nmost of all, it felt like <i>New York</i>.\nThere was no other word to describe the peculiar atmosphere.</p><p>You had spotted from afar a\nlittle flower shop at the corner of the street, on the right side of the park.\nAnd with such a sun shining in the sky, you couldn\u2019t refrain the urge to buy a\nbouquet for your apartment. Or well, your cousin\u2019s apartment, actually. Edgar\nhad accepted with a grin to welcome you in his flat for the three months you\nwere to work in the busy city. You were thus living now with him\u2026 and almost\nwith his boyfriend too, as Sebastian spent more time there than in his own\nflat.</p><p>And you reckoned that nor\nEdgar nor Seb would mind if you bought a few bright flowers.</p><p>You headed there with a\ncontent smile on your face, humming softly a song to yourself, your voice\ncovered by the sounds of the street.</p><p>Cars honked a few meters away\nas you reached the door of the shop. Flowers were also sprayed outside, the\nbouquets narrowing the sidewalk, and you spent a few minutes admiring the\nplants. You smelled some of them, from gerberas to daisies and roses. Red,\nyellow, white, pink, orange\u2026 so many colours that widened the smile on your\nlips.</p><p>You chose a few gerberas and\nfinally walked inside the shop, discovering flowers and plants everywhere,\nfilling the room, resting on many shelves\u2026 so many that the stone walls were\nbarely visible under so many petals and leaves.</p><p>You were admiring a red\nhibiscus when you spotted on the wooden floor what looked like a piece of\nleather. You picked it up and recognized the object as a wallet. Puzzled, you\nbrought it to one of the employees, a tall woman with red hair whose name was\npinned on her apron as Carlotta. </p><p>&ldquo;Oh\u2026 dear!

Have you\nchosen some flowers? Oh, now\u2026 what a good choice! Gerberas are such happy\nflowers, I\u2019ll make you a bouquet!&rdquo;</p><p>As you walked out of the shop,\nyou took a deep breath into the sweet scent of your flowers, closing your eyes\nto engrave the fragrance in your lungs, trying to remember it. </p><p>When you opened your eyes\nagain, you let your gaze drift across the crowd\u2026 A woman pushing a stroller, a\ncouple holding hands, a man running with his dog next to him and finally waiting\nat a traffic light\u2026</p><p>Why would someone be rushing\ntoday? </p><p>After all, it was such a\nlovely day\u2026</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p><p>These past couple of days had\nbeen hell.</p><p>Chris was near panicked.

He\nremembered it was around there, but his brain seemed too numbed by stress and\nnerves to work properly.</p><p>By his side, Dodger barked a\ncouple of times as the traffic light turned green and people started to hurry\nforward. As he crossed the road, he finally spotted the bright flowers in the\ndistance.</p><p>He didn&rsquo;t slow down his pace\nbefore he had reached the welcoming shop, and he did nothing less than run\ninside.</p><p>He hurried to Carlotta, who\nstood behind the counter, and he had to lean against the wooden surface as he\ncaught his breath.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, hello again! I\nrecognize you, you were here this morning already! Have you changed your mind\nand want to buy something?&rdquo; Carlotta asked with a bright smile.</p><p>But Chris shook his head.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve lost my wallet this\nmorning, so I&rsquo;m tracing back my steps,&rdquo; he explained, heaving a sigh to\ntry to slow down his racing heart, his voice cut by his shallow breathing.\n&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t have found it, by any chance?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh!

Slowly, he\ncaught his breath and felt his heart reach a regular rhythm once more. He\ndidn&rsquo;t look up before Carlotta was back with the wallet, and he let out a grunt\nas he forced himself to stand straighter again. </p><p>He recognized his belonging in\nthe blink of an eye, and he heaved a relieved sigh.</p><p>&ldquo;Thank god\u2026&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It is yours indeed! You\nreally are lucky, I hadn&rsquo;t spotted it at all.

That&rsquo;s a\nvery good choice, they&rsquo;re particularly beautiful this year!&rdquo;</p><p>Carlotta hurried outside to\nfetch some pink peonies, the shade pale and as delicate as the petals\nthemselves. Meanwhile, Chris was petting Dodger with a bright laugh.</p><p>&ldquo;Ends well, buddy! I\ndidn&rsquo;t think so at first!&rdquo;</p><p>The dog merely swayed his tail\nand barked a couple of times in response, as if seeing Chris smiling was enough\nto make the pet understand that the day was not so bad after all.</p><p>As the florist came back with\nthe flowers, she kept the conversation going.</p><p>&ldquo;Such a lovely lady, it\nwas\u2026 and an honest one!

I sure will give her your note, if she comes back.&rdquo;</p><p>She gave him a pen and a piece\nof paper so he could write his short message, and eventually, he walked out of\nthe shop with a smile on his lips.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p><p>You were walking in the early\nhours of the morning. The rising sun still shed red lights across the rooftops\nand the high skyscrapers. You were not to start working before lunchtime, the\nrepetitions would start then.

The weather, just like the day before, promised only sunshine and\nsmiles.</p><p>Somehow, your feet guided you\nback to Central Park, and you walked before that flower shop again, the one in\nwhich you had bought your flowers the day before. It was not open yet, but you\ntook a moment to look at the flowers inside anyway, glancing at the bright\nshades through the windows. And the sight brought a smile to your lips.</p><p>You were about to walk away\nwhen Carlotta stormed out of the shop.</p><p>&ldquo;Ha! I knew it was you!\nYou&rsquo;re the girl from yesterday, who found the wallet!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Huh\u2026 yes?&rdquo; you\nraised an eyebrow, perplexed.</p><p>&ldquo;I gave the wallet back\nto his owner!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Great\u2026&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He left a note for you, hang\non!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A note\u2026?&rdquo;</p><p>But before you could add\nanother word, Carlotta had stormed inside the shop again, and only reappeared\nwith a piece of paper in her hand.</p><p>You thanked her, taking the\nnote and clumsily changing your weight from one foot to the other as you felt\nquite uncomfortable.</p><p>The handwriting was quite\nclear despite the obvious hurry it was written with.</p><p><i>Dear Stranger,</i></p><p><i>Thank you for returning my wallet, I was quite distraught when I\nrealized I had lost it.

Hang on, I&rsquo;ll fetch you a pen and some paper!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to bother\u2026&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, but it makes me\nhappy! The thought is romantic, don&rsquo;t you think? Two strangers exchanging love\nletters in my flower shop\u2026&rdquo;</p><p>You laughed at her as she\ndisappeared again, and came back with what you needed to write a message of\nyour own.</p><p><i>Dear Stranger,</i></p><p><i>There is nothing to thank me for, it was only normal to give you back\nyour wallet intact. Carlotta might be a little too romantic. After all, she already\npictures us exchanging love letters through her hands. What a funny idea!</i></p><p><i>Have a nice day too, and don&rsquo;t lose your wallet again this time! I might\nnot be here to find it again for you.</i></p><p>You handed the florist the\nnote, and she excitedly put it in her pocket.</p><p>&ldquo;Do something for me, and\ncome back here in a few days. Who knows\u2026 he may have replied by then.&rdquo;</p><p>You laughed at her again, but\nthere was something so excited and honest in her gaze, that you agreed. After\nall, it couldn&rsquo;t hurt to drop by, right?

The streets were filled with merry strangers mingling with the always-hurrying\nworkers. Unknown faces that kept on moving all around, in one direction or the\nother. And in the centre of the busy city, Central Park was an oasis lost in a\ndesert.</p><p>Central Park was filled with\nlaziness and sunshine. Children played while their parents relaxed under the\nshadow of the trees. And through the park, the flowers coloured the alleys and\nfilled the air with sugary fragrances. </p><p>Everything felt sunny and\nhappy to you. But perhaps it was also the prospect of starting a new job that\nmade you this merry. </p><p>A three months job was\nawaiting you here in New York. The creation of a new movie was always exciting\nto you. It meant that you would bring a brand-new character to life. After all,\nit was the advantage of becoming an actress. </p><p>You would start this new job the\nnext day, and you had to admit that your excitement was tainted with\napprehension. It was always a strange mix of fear and excitement, to start a\nnew adventure. And because this next movie was a love story, you were even more\nnervous than usual. After all, if you couldn\u2019t get along with the actor playing\nyour love interest, everything would be harder.</p><p>You counted on Chris Evans\u2019s\nprofessionalism in any case. After all, he was talented and had a good\nreputation amongst actors. Everything would surely be just fine.</p><p>You crossed the street from\nthe edge of the park to the busy sidewalks that ran against the skyscrapers. An\nold man was selling hot dogs, when a few meters away, you could buy today\u2019s\nnewspapers. There was a strange excitation all around you, a dance of shorts\nand dresses and briefcases and suits. A mix of holidays and busy workers. But\nmost of all, it felt like <i>New York</i>.\nThere was no other word to describe the peculiar atmosphere.</p><p>You had spotted from afar a\nlittle flower shop at the corner of the street, on the right side of the park.\nAnd with such a sun shining in the sky, you couldn\u2019t refrain the urge to buy a\nbouquet for your apartment. Or well, your cousin\u2019s apartment, actually. Edgar\nhad accepted with a grin to welcome you in his flat for the three months you\nwere to work in the busy city. You were thus living now with him\u2026 and almost\nwith his boyfriend too, as Sebastian spent more time there than in his own\nflat.</p><p>And you reckoned that nor\nEdgar nor Seb would mind if you bought a few bright flowers.</p><p>You headed there with a\ncontent smile on your face, humming softly a song to yourself, your voice\ncovered by the sounds of the street.</p><p>Cars honked a few meters away\nas you reached the door of the shop. Flowers were also sprayed outside, the\nbouquets narrowing the sidewalk, and you spent a few minutes admiring the\nplants. You smelled some of them, from gerberas to daisies and roses. Red,\nyellow, white, pink, orange\u2026 so many colours that widened the smile on your\nlips.</p><p>You chose a few gerberas and\nfinally walked inside the shop, discovering flowers and plants everywhere,\nfilling the room, resting on many shelves\u2026 so many that the stone walls were\nbarely visible under so many petals and leaves.</p><p>You were admiring a red\nhibiscus when you spotted on the wooden floor what looked like a piece of\nleather. You picked it up and recognized the object as a wallet. Puzzled, you\nbrought it to one of the employees, a tall woman with red hair whose name was\npinned on her apron as Carlotta. </p><p>\u201cOh\u2026 dear! The poor man!\u201d\nshe exclaimed, looking around the shop, but there was no other client than you\ninside. \u201cWell, give it to me, dear. I\u2019ll make sure he gets it. Have you\nchosen some flowers? Oh, now\u2026 what a good choice!

The streets were filled with merry strangers mingling with the always-hurrying\nworkers. Unknown faces that kept on moving all around, in one direction or the\nother. And in the centre of the busy city, Central Park was an oasis lost in a\ndesert.</p><p>Central Park was filled with\nlaziness and sunshine. Children played while their parents relaxed under the\nshadow of the trees. And through the park, the flowers coloured the alleys and\nfilled the air with sugary fragrances. </p><p>Everything felt sunny and\nhappy to you. But perhaps it was also the prospect of starting a new job that\nmade you this merry. </p><p>A three months job was\nawaiting you here in New York. The creation of a new movie was always exciting\nto you. It meant that you would bring a brand-new character to life. After all,\nit was the advantage of becoming an actress. </p><p>You would start this new job the\nnext day, and you had to admit that your excitement was tainted with\napprehension. It was always a strange mix of fear and excitement, to start a\nnew adventure. And because this next movie was a love story, you were even more\nnervous than usual. After all, if you couldn\u2019t get along with the actor playing\nyour love interest, everything would be harder.</p><p>You counted on Chris Evans\u2019s\nprofessionalism in any case. After all, he was talented and had a good\nreputation amongst actors. Everything would surely be just fine.</p><p>You crossed the street from\nthe edge of the park to the busy sidewalks that ran against the skyscrapers. An\nold man was selling hot dogs, when a few meters away, you could buy today\u2019s\nnewspapers. There was a strange excitation all around you, a dance of shorts\nand dresses and briefcases and suits. A mix of holidays and busy workers. But\nmost of all, it felt like <i>New York</i>.\nThere was no other word to describe the peculiar atmosphere.</p><p>You had spotted from afar a\nlittle flower shop at the corner of the street, on the right side of the park.\nAnd with such a sun shining in the sky, you couldn\u2019t refrain the urge to buy a\nbouquet for your apartment. Or well, your cousin\u2019s apartment, actually. Edgar\nhad accepted with a grin to welcome you in his flat for the three months you\nwere to work in the busy city. You were thus living now with him\u2026 and almost\nwith his boyfriend too, as Sebastian spent more time there than in his own\nflat.</p><p>And you reckoned that nor\nEdgar nor Seb would mind if you bought a few bright flowers.</p><p>You headed there with a\ncontent smile on your face, humming softly a song to yourself, your voice\ncovered by the sounds of the street.</p><p>Cars honked a few meters away\nas you reached the door of the shop. Flowers were also sprayed outside, the\nbouquets narrowing the sidewalk, and you spent a few minutes admiring the\nplants. You smelled some of them, from gerberas to daisies and roses. Red,\nyellow, white, pink, orange\u2026 so many colours that widened the smile on your\nlips.</p><p>You chose a few gerberas and\nfinally walked inside the shop, discovering flowers and plants everywhere,\nfilling the room, resting on many shelves\u2026 so many that the stone walls were\nbarely visible under so many petals and leaves.</p><p>You were admiring a red\nhibiscus when you spotted on the wooden floor what looked like a piece of\nleather. You picked it up and recognized the object as a wallet. Puzzled, you\nbrought it to one of the employees, a tall woman with red hair whose name was\npinned on her apron as Carlotta. </p><p>\u201cOh\u2026 dear! The poor man!\u201d\nshe exclaimed, looking around the shop, but there was no other client than you\ninside. \u201cWell, give it to me, dear. I\u2019ll make sure he gets it. Have you\nchosen some flowers? Oh, now\u2026 what a good choice! Gerberas are such happy\nflowers, I\u2019ll make you a bouquet!\u201d</p><p>As you walked out of the shop,\nyou took a deep breath into the sweet scent of your flowers, closing your eyes\nto engrave the fragrance in your lungs, trying to remember it. </p><p>When you opened your eyes\nagain, you let your gaze drift across the crowd\u2026 A woman pushing a stroller, a\ncouple holding hands, a man running with his dog next to him and finally waiting\nat a traffic light\u2026</p><p>Why would someone be rushing\ntoday? </p><p>After all, it was such a\nlovely day\u2026</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>These past couple of days had\nbeen hell.</p><p>Chris was near panicked. His\nstay at New York started beautifully\u2026</p><p>He had missed his train to\ncome from Boston, had almost killed a cat with a dishwasher (that adventure was\nprobably the worst) and now he had lost his wallet.</p><p>Beautiful start indeed\u2026</p><p>He was now running through the\nstreets of New York, Dodger\u2019s leash tightly held in his hand. And he found that\nthe weather was way too hot for that\u2026</p><p>Waiting for the lights to turn\ngreen at a crossroad, he took off his Patriots cap to dry his sweaty brow. By\nhis side, Dodger seemed to have a good time running around the streets.</p><p>At least one of them had a\ngood time\u2026</p><p>His heart was beating fast,\nbut Chris wasn\u2019t sure if it was because of his running or because of the fear\nthat made a lump creep up his throat.</p><p>He searched again for this\nflower shop he had stopped by a few hours before. </p><p>Where was that damn shop\u2026? He\nremembered it was around there, but his brain seemed too numbed by stress and\nnerves to work properly.</p><p>By his side, Dodger barked a\ncouple of times as the traffic light turned green and people started to hurry\nforward. As he crossed the road, he finally spotted the bright flowers in the\ndistance.</p><p>He didn\u2019t slow down his pace\nbefore he had reached the welcoming shop, and he did nothing less than run\ninside.</p><p>He hurried to Carlotta, who\nstood behind the counter, and he had to lean against the wooden surface as he\ncaught his breath.</p><p>\u201cOh, hello again! I\nrecognize you, you were here this morning already! Have you changed your mind\nand want to buy something?\u201d Carlotta asked with a bright smile.</p><p>But Chris shook his head.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve lost my wallet this\nmorning, so I\u2019m tracing back my steps,\u201d he explained, heaving a sigh to\ntry to slow down his racing heart, his voice cut by his shallow breathing.\n\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t have found it, by any chance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh! But of course!\nYou\u2019re a lucky man! This lovely woman just found one near the hibiscus over\nthere. Hang on, I\u2019ll check the ID inside to see if it\u2019s yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes, please\ndo,\u201d Chris begged, leaning over the wooden counter while the florist\nwalked in her office.</p><p>He rested his cheek against\nthe cool surface, closing his tired eyes, breathing deeply to fill his lungs\nwith as much air as he could, before letting it all out again. Slowly, he\ncaught his breath and felt his heart reach a regular rhythm once more. He\ndidn\u2019t look up before Carlotta was back with the wallet, and he let out a grunt\nas he forced himself to stand straighter again. </p><p>He recognized his belonging in\nthe blink of an eye, and he heaved a relieved sigh.</p><p>\u201cThank god\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is yours indeed! You\nreally are lucky, I hadn\u2019t spotted it at all. It\u2019s a client who did, and\u2026 oh\nactually you could have bumped into each other, she exited the shop a minute\nbefore you rushed in!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter such a fright, I\u2019m\nglad it ended that way!\u201d he grinned, resting a hand on his heart.\n\u201cActually\u2026 now that I\u2019ve found my wallet back, I think I\u2019ll buy these\nflowers I saw outside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe peonies? That\u2019s a\nvery good choice, they\u2019re particularly beautiful this year!\u201d</p><p>Carlotta hurried outside to\nfetch some pink peonies, the shade pale and as delicate as the petals\nthemselves. Meanwhile, Chris was petting Dodger with a bright laugh.</p><p>\u201cEnds well, buddy! I\ndidn\u2019t think so at first!\u201d</p><p>The dog merely swayed his tail\nand barked a couple of times in response, as if seeing Chris smiling was enough\nto make the pet understand that the day was not so bad after all.</p><p>As the florist came back with\nthe flowers, she kept the conversation going.</p><p>\u201cSuch a lovely lady, it\nwas\u2026 and an honest one! These days, many would have taken the money before\nhanding over the rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, if she comes back,\nplease, thank her for me.\u201d</p><p>He paid for the flowers and\nturned around to leave, but he stopped dead in his tracks before even taking a\nstep towards the door.</p><p>Dodger was already trotting\ntowards the exit, pulling on his leash but Chris wasn\u2019t moving. Instead, he\nspun back around towards Carlotta.</p><p>\u201cActually\u2026 if she comes\nback\u2026 would you mind giving her a note? I\u2019d like to thank her myself and\u2026 give\nher a peony for me. I\u2019ll buy you one more.\u201d</p><p>Carlotta heaved a dreamy sigh.</p><p>\u201cNow, what a gentleman we\nhave here! I sure will give her your note, if she comes back.\u201d</p><p>She gave him a pen and a piece\nof paper so he could write his short message, and eventually, he walked out of\nthe shop with a smile on his lips.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>You were walking in the early\nhours of the morning. The rising sun still shed red lights across the rooftops\nand the high skyscrapers. You were not to start working before lunchtime, the\nrepetitions would start then. You had your whole morning free, and you intended\nto enjoy it. The weather, just like the day before, promised only sunshine and\nsmiles.</p><p>Somehow, your feet guided you\nback to Central Park, and you walked before that flower shop again, the one in\nwhich you had bought your flowers the day before. It was not open yet, but you\ntook a moment to look at the flowers inside anyway, glancing at the bright\nshades through the windows. And the sight brought a smile to your lips.</p><p>You were about to walk away\nwhen Carlotta stormed out of the shop.</p><p>\u201cHa! I knew it was you!\nYou\u2019re the girl from yesterday, who found the wallet!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh\u2026 yes?\u201d you\nraised an eyebrow, perplexed.</p><p>\u201cI gave the wallet back\nto his owner!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe left a note for you, hang\non!\u201d</p><p>\u201cA note\u2026?\u201d</p><p>But before you could add\nanother word, Carlotta had stormed inside the shop again, and only reappeared\nwith a piece of paper in her hand.</p><p>You thanked her, taking the\nnote and clumsily changing your weight from one foot to the other as you felt\nquite uncomfortable.</p><p>The handwriting was quite\nclear despite the obvious hurry it was written with.</p><p><i>Dear Stranger,</i></p><p><i>Thank you for returning my wallet, I was quite distraught when I\nrealized I had lost it. Thank you as well for not stealing all the money that\nwas inside, the florist seemed indeed to think it was an admirable act.\nChivalry is most certainly still alive, at least, she seemed to think so.</i></p><p><i>I hope you have a nice day.</i></p><p>You smiled at the message, and\nthe gesture only widened as Carlotta handed you a peony.</p><p>\u201cHe asked me to give you\nthis too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, thank you,\u201d\nyou mumbled, blushing hard.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s him you should\nthank!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell if you see him\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, but you should write\nhim a reply! Hang on, I\u2019ll fetch you a pen and some paper!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to bother\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, but it makes me\nhappy! The thought is romantic, don\u2019t you think?

But perhaps it was also the prospect of starting a new job that\nmade you this merry. </p><p>A three months job was\nawaiting you here in New York. The creation of a new movie was always exciting\nto you. It meant that you would bring a brand-new character to life. After all,\nit was the advantage of becoming an actress. </p><p>You would start this new job the\nnext day, and you had to admit that your excitement was tainted with\napprehension. It was always a strange mix of fear and excitement, to start a\nnew adventure. And because this next movie was a love story, you were even more\nnervous than usual. After all, if you couldn&rsquo;t get along with the actor playing\nyour love interest, everything would be harder.</p><p>You counted on Chris Evans&rsquo;s\nprofessionalism in any case. After all, he was talented and had a good\nreputation amongst actors. Everything would surely be just fine.</p><p>You crossed the street from\nthe edge of the park to the busy sidewalks that ran against the skyscrapers. An\nold man was selling hot dogs, when a few meters away, you could buy today&rsquo;s\nnewspapers. There was a strange excitation all around you, a dance of shorts\nand dresses and briefcases and suits. A mix of holidays and busy workers. But\nmost of all, it felt like <i>New York</i>.\nThere was no other word to describe the peculiar atmosphere.</p><p>You had spotted from afar a\nlittle flower shop at the corner of the street, on the right side of the park.\nAnd with such a sun shining in the sky, you couldn&rsquo;t refrain the urge to buy a\nbouquet for your apartment. Or well, your cousin&rsquo;s apartment, actually. Edgar\nhad accepted with a grin to welcome you in his flat for the three months you\nwere to work in the busy city. You were thus living now with him&hellip; and almost\nwith his boyfriend too, as Sebastian spent more time there than in his own\nflat.</p><p>And you reckoned that nor\nEdgar nor Seb would mind if you bought a few bright flowers.</p><p>You headed there with a\ncontent smile on your face, humming softly a song to yourself, your voice\ncovered by the sounds of the street.</p><p>Cars honked a few meters away\nas you reached the door of the shop. Flowers were also sprayed outside, the\nbouquets narrowing the sidewalk, and you spent a few minutes admiring the\nplants. You smelled some of them, from gerberas to daisies and roses. Red,\nyellow, white, pink, orange&hellip; so many colours that widened the smile on your\nlips.</p><p>You chose a few gerberas and\nfinally walked inside the shop, discovering flowers and plants everywhere,\nfilling the room, resting on many shelves&hellip; so many that the stone walls were\nbarely visible under so many petals and leaves.</p><p>You were admiring a red\nhibiscus when you spotted on the wooden floor what looked like a piece of\nleather. You picked it up and recognized the object as a wallet. Puzzled, you\nbrought it to one of the employees, a tall woman with red hair whose name was\npinned on her apron as Carlotta. </p><p>&ldquo;Oh&hellip; dear! The poor man!&rdquo;\nshe exclaimed, looking around the shop, but there was no other client than you\ninside. &ldquo;Well, give it to me, dear. I&rsquo;ll make sure he gets it. Have you\nchosen some flowers? Oh, now&hellip; what a good choice! Gerberas are such happy\nflowers, I&rsquo;ll make you a bouquet!&rdquo;</p><p>As you walked out of the shop,\nyou took a deep breath into the sweet scent of your flowers, closing your eyes\nto engrave the fragrance in your lungs, trying to remember it. </p><p>When you opened your eyes\nagain, you let your gaze drift across the crowd&hellip; A woman pushing a stroller, a\ncouple holding hands, a man running with his dog next to him and finally waiting\nat a traffic light&hellip;</p><p>Why would someone be rushing\ntoday? </p><p>After all, it was such a\nlovely day&hellip;</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p><p>These past couple of days had\nbeen hell.</p><p>Chris was near panicked. His\nstay at New York started beautifully&hellip;</p><p>He had missed his train to\ncome from Boston, had almost killed a cat with a dishwasher (that adventure was\nprobably the worst) and now he had lost his wallet.</p><p>Beautiful start indeed&hellip;</p><p>He was now running through the\nstreets of New York, Dodger&rsquo;s leash tightly held in his hand. And he found that\nthe weather was way too hot for that&hellip;</p><p>Waiting for the lights to turn\ngreen at a crossroad, he took off his Patriots cap to dry his sweaty brow. By\nhis side, Dodger seemed to have a good time running around the streets.</p><p>At least one of them had a\ngood time&hellip;</p><p>His heart was beating fast,\nbut Chris wasn&rsquo;t sure if it was because of his running or because of the fear\nthat made a lump creep up his throat.</p><p>He searched again for this\nflower shop he had stopped by a few hours before. </p><p>Where was that damn shop&hellip;? He\nremembered it was around there, but his brain seemed too numbed by stress and\nnerves to work properly.</p><p>By his side, Dodger barked a\ncouple of times as the traffic light turned green and people started to hurry\nforward. As he crossed the road, he finally spotted the bright flowers in the\ndistance.</p><p>He didn&rsquo;t slow down his pace\nbefore he had reached the welcoming shop, and he did nothing less than run\ninside.</p><p>He hurried to Carlotta, who\nstood behind the counter, and he had to lean against the wooden surface as he\ncaught his breath.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, hello again! I\nrecognize you, you were here this morning already! Have you changed your mind\nand want to buy something?&rdquo; Carlotta asked with a bright smile.</p><p>But Chris shook his head.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve lost my wallet this\nmorning, so I&rsquo;m tracing back my steps,&rdquo; he explained, heaving a sigh to\ntry to slow down his racing heart, his voice cut by his shallow breathing.\n&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t have found it, by any chance?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh! But of course!\nYou&rsquo;re a lucky man! This lovely woman just found one near the hibiscus over\nthere. Hang on, I&rsquo;ll check the ID inside to see if it&rsquo;s yours.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, please\ndo,&rdquo; Chris begged, leaning over the wooden counter while the florist\nwalked in her office.</p><p>He rested his cheek against\nthe cool surface, closing his tired eyes, breathing deeply to fill his lungs\nwith as much air as he could, before letting it all out again. Slowly, he\ncaught his breath and felt his heart reach a regular rhythm once more. He\ndidn&rsquo;t look up before Carlotta was back with the wallet, and he let out a grunt\nas he forced himself to stand straighter again. </p><p>He recognized his belonging in\nthe blink of an eye, and he heaved a relieved sigh.</p><p>&ldquo;Thank god&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It is yours indeed! You\nreally are lucky, I hadn&rsquo;t spotted it at all. It&rsquo;s a client who did, and&hellip; oh\nactually you could have bumped into each other, she exited the shop a minute\nbefore you rushed in!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;After such a fright, I&rsquo;m\nglad it ended that way!&rdquo; he grinned, resting a hand on his heart.\n&ldquo;Actually&hellip; now that I&rsquo;ve found my wallet back, I think I&rsquo;ll buy these\nflowers I saw outside.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The peonies? That&rsquo;s a\nvery good choice, they&rsquo;re particularly beautiful this year!&rdquo;</p><p>Carlotta hurried outside to\nfetch some pink peonies, the shade pale and as delicate as the petals\nthemselves. Meanwhile, Chris was petting Dodger with a bright laugh.</p><p>&ldquo;Ends well, buddy! I\ndidn&rsquo;t think so at first!&rdquo;</p><p>The dog merely swayed his tail\nand barked a couple of times in response, as if seeing Chris smiling was enough\nto make the pet understand that the day was not so bad after all.</p><p>As the florist came back with\nthe flowers, she kept the conversation going.</p><p>&ldquo;Such a lovely lady, it\nwas&hellip; and an honest one! These days, many would have taken the money before\nhanding over the rest.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, if she comes back,\nplease, thank her for me.&rdquo;</p><p>He paid for the flowers and\nturned around to leave, but he stopped dead in his tracks before even taking a\nstep towards the door.</p><p>Dodger was already trotting\ntowards the exit, pulling on his leash but Chris wasn&rsquo;t moving. Instead, he\nspun back around towards Carlotta.</p><p>&ldquo;Actually&hellip; if she comes\nback&hellip; would you mind giving her a note? I&rsquo;d like to thank her myself and&hellip; give\nher a peony for me. I&rsquo;ll buy you one more.&rdquo;</p><p>Carlotta heaved a dreamy sigh.</p><p>&ldquo;Now, what a gentleman we\nhave here! I sure will give her your note, if she comes back.&rdquo;</p><p>She gave him a pen and a piece\nof paper so he could write his short message, and eventually, he walked out of\nthe shop with a smile on his lips.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p><p>You were walking in the early\nhours of the morning. The rising sun still shed red lights across the rooftops\nand the high skyscrapers. You were not to start working before lunchtime, the\nrepetitions would start then. You had your whole morning free, and you intended\nto enjoy it. The weather, just like the day before, promised only sunshine and\nsmiles.</p><p>Somehow, your feet guided you\nback to Central Park, and you walked before that flower shop again, the one in\nwhich you had bought your flowers the day before. It was not open yet, but you\ntook a moment to look at the flowers inside anyway, glancing at the bright\nshades through the windows. And the sight brought a smile to your lips.</p><p>You were about to walk away\nwhen Carlotta stormed out of the shop.</p><p>&ldquo;Ha! I knew it was you!\nYou&rsquo;re the girl from yesterday, who found the wallet!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Huh&hellip; yes?&rdquo; you\nraised an eyebrow, perplexed.</p><p>&ldquo;I gave the wallet back\nto his owner!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Great&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He left a note for you, hang\non!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A note&hellip;?&rdquo;</p><p>But before you could add\nanother word, Carlotta had stormed inside the shop again, and only reappeared\nwith a piece of paper in her hand.</p><p>You thanked her, taking the\nnote and clumsily changing your weight from one foot to the other as you felt\nquite uncomfortable.</p><p>The handwriting was quite\nclear despite the obvious hurry it was written with.</p><p><i>Dear Stranger,</i></p><p><i>Thank you for returning my wallet, I was quite distraught when I\nrealized I had lost it. Thank you as well for not stealing all the money that\nwas inside, the florist seemed indeed to think it was an admirable act.\nChivalry is most certainly still alive, at least, she seemed to think so.</i></p><p><i>I hope you have a nice day.</i></p><p>You smiled at the message, and\nthe gesture only widened as Carlotta handed you a peony.</p><p>&ldquo;He asked me to give you\nthis too.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, thank you,&rdquo;\nyou mumbled, blushing hard.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s him you should\nthank!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well if you see him&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, but you should write\nhim a reply! Hang on, I&rsquo;ll fetch you a pen and some paper!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to bother&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, but it makes me\nhappy! The thought is romantic, don&rsquo;t you think? Two strangers exchanging love\nletters in my flower shop&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>You laughed at her as she\ndisappeared again, and came back with what you needed to write a message of\nyour own.</p><p><i>Dear Stranger,</i></p><p><i>There is nothing to thank me for, it was only normal to give you back\nyour wallet intact. Carlotta might be a little too romantic. After all, she already\npictures us exchanging love letters through her hands. What a funny idea!</i></p><p><i>Have a nice day too, and don&rsquo;t lose your wallet again this time! I might\nnot be here to find it again for you.</i></p><p>You handed the florist the\nnote, and she excitedly put it in her pocket.</p><p>&ldquo;Do something for me, and\ncome back here in a few days. Who knows&hellip; he may have replied by then.&rdquo;</p><p>You laughed at her again, but\nthere was something so excited and honest in her gaze, that you agreed. After\nall, it couldn&rsquo;t hurt to drop by, right? It wasn&rsquo;t like it would change your\nlife&hellip;</p><p>&nbsp;******************************</p><p><i>Tag list :&nbsp;<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mCgfC5JLOYBzTrDu_f7vn-Q\">@ponycake27</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mENCuoj2Y2FWRs7vSqkhV0A\">@horsesreign</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m73TQMXCYLh_u_pJQ4Et1dg\">@xinyourdreamsx</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_35jxdvhfiy-Obd4zPuA3w\">@jbluevelvet</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mFTMgmPEUlqeCD-JNf7ngAA\">@notkeppeki</a> @daynigt-dreamer-stuff <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mnFrCKDDhL-EQKGqeEzO_EA\">@fudgeflyss</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m1MkMuKiJe3d3oZwhuaAWtg\">@stuckupstucky</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mU-_XHuZ7qqMCrY7H3HV5Cg\">@snek-shit</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfbRleqOB06vpn44dJ4JIOg\">@suchatinyinfinity</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mMbLdl_jTZ71nHN9hQNwFuw\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mMbLdl_jTZ71nHN9hQNwFuw\">@i-padfootblack-things</a>&nbsp;<a title=\"theonelittleone\" href=\"http://theonelittleone.tumblr.com/\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m1HBdK2X9cb3cvKUkpPIZzA\">@theonelittleone</a></i></p><p><i>I allow myself to also tag : <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mMexGQBJmt0es1MFrxAWFOg\">@madamrogers</a> and <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/meYbrLhecbun8iKyMdkWqVg\">@marvelcapsicle</a> cause I know they will be interested&hellip;</i></p></p>",
