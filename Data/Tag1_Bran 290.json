The two of you have been friends for quite some time.

I was only riding with Sansa and Robb&rdquo; you defend, but she scowled at you none-the-less.</p><p>Catelyn couldn&rsquo;t stop her hatred for you, no matter how hard she tried. &ldquo;I want you to leave&rdquo; she spits with anger and hate in her eyes. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry milady, I didn&rsquo;t mean to anger you&rdquo; You apologized, quickly hurrying out of the room. On your way, down the hall you rushed into Robb, and didn&rsquo;t even realize until he had you by the wrist, keeping you from the ground.</p><p>Of course it was bothersome for you, to have earned nothing but Lady Catelyn&rsquo;s aggression regardless of how hard you tried to make her like you. &ldquo;Why are you in such a hurry for, aren&rsquo;t you going to see Bran?&rdquo; he asked, almost forcing you to burst into tears.</p><p>&ldquo;Lady Catelyn wont let me see him, she says its my fault he is hurt &rdquo; You blubbered, normally you tried to save face but with something like Bran at stake, there was no way to do so. </p><p>&ldquo;Hush now&rdquo; Robb whispered, pulling you into him. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not your fault&rdquo; he assured, hugging you into his chest as he tried his hardest to soothe you. </p><p>&ldquo;Its not your fault&rdquo; he repeated over and over before letting you up. It was crazy to him that his mother was willing to make you feel so guilty about something out of your control. &ldquo;Come now, stay behind me and we shall see him, just stay quiet&rdquo; he suggests, wrapping you simply in his cloak before leading you down the hall toward Bran&rsquo;s room.</p><p>&ldquo;Mother&rdquo; you heard Robb bellow, before hearing only a whimper from Catelyn in reply.</p><p>&ldquo;He is dead, that&rsquo;s all they say, he is dead&rdquo; She cries and you wince at the word &ldquo;He isn&rsquo;t&rdquo; Robb assures her. You took this moment to peak through the fabric of his cloak, almost breaking down at the sight of your broken friend.</p><p>&ldquo;Why are you angry with Y/N&rdquo; He asked, hiding your tense at his name. &ldquo;This is her fault&rdquo; she spit, shutting down his words without so much as a breath. You would have run for the hills if she spoke to you that way, but Robb didn&rsquo;t falter. &ldquo;This has nothing to do with her&rdquo; he reminded, his voice strong and commanding as he headed toward the door, with you on his heels. </p><p>&ldquo;She truly does hate me&rdquo; You frowned, as soon as you stopped in the hall. Robb shook his head again &ldquo;She is only hurt because she worries for him, don&rsquo;t take it personally&rdquo; he assured you, sending you off to find Arya.</p><p>If anyone was going to help you feel better after such a problem, it would be Arya. </p><p>-</p><p>Bran had woken a few weeks ago and you were hardly prepared for the news that his awakening would bring. </p><p>&ldquo;He cannot walk&rdquo; Jon had informed you and you nearly choked &ldquo;He cant walk&rdquo; you repeated, making sure you heard him right. Robb nodded, letting you know that the sick joke was the truth. &ldquo;Can I speak to him?&rdquo; your voice was slight, and careful as you implored the answer to both men. &ldquo;I will take you, you shouldn&rsquo;t go alone&rdquo; Robb nodded, taking your hand.</p><p>There was a good chance that even after all this time, Catelyn hadn&rsquo;t gotten over her upset and he wasn&rsquo;t going to throw you to the wolves alone. &ldquo;Will you come too Bran?&rdquo; you ask, earning an odd look from him. You and Jon had never been the closest but you needed all the support you could get right now.</p><p>When you all finally got to Bran&rsquo;s room, he was leaning on his bed side. &ldquo;Bran&rdquo; you muttered, your words falling from your lips in a gasp, throwing yourself from the two men and onto the bed.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re alive&rdquo; you yelled, hugging him roughly, avoiding his legs but holding him tight in your arms. &ldquo;Barely&rdquo; he groaned, shrugging away from you quickly. It wasn&rsquo;t for the sake of you, but he was ashamed. </p><p>He was less of a man now. He wanted to marry you and build a strong home to raise your children in but who would want a cripple? </p><p>&ldquo;Bran?&rdquo; you questioned, his behavior was odd and put you on edge. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t walk, I&rsquo;m a cripple&hellip;useless, I&rsquo;d rather be dead&rdquo; He barked, instantly earning a gasp from you. How dare he say something like that? You&rsquo;d been through so much over the last few months while he was unconscious, and now he felt inclined enough to say something so brash.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ever say that Bran, you aren&rsquo;t a cripple, you survived&rdquo; you assured, running your hand over the side of his face, letting your touch relax him ever so slightly. You simply looking in his eyes, even though he didn&rsquo;t want to look in yours. &ldquo;Leave me&rdquo; he ordered and you frowned, but stepped off the bed anyway, past Jon and Robb out the door.</p><p>You wanted to support Bran but it didn&rsquo;t mean anything if he didn&rsquo;t want you to. Even you knew that much.</p><p>&ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo; Robb yells toward Bran, the boy only looked at him blankly. Robb turned quickly to follow you, leaving Jon and Bran all alone.</p><p>&ldquo;Can I talk to you Bran?&rdquo; Jon asked, sitting beside his brother on the bed. The boy nodded, giving his brother as much of his attention as he could. &ldquo;Do you understand why Y/N is here?&rdquo; he asked, starting the conversation of simply.</p><p>Bran shook his head.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, when the time comes, you will marry her and she will live here in the north with you&rdquo; he explained, his attention poised on his brother &ldquo;So she isn&rsquo;t my friend?&rdquo; he countered, not completely understanding what you were going with.</p><p>Jon chuckled, Bran really had no idea what was going on &ldquo;She is but she is more than that, she is to be your wife, your lady&rdquo; finally, Bran nodded. He&rsquo;d heard of people being betrothed before, but never did he think about you in that compacity.</p><p>It took a few moments for the information to sink in and once it did, Bran had a secondary question. &ldquo;And I will love her?&rdquo; his words caught Jon off guard but he smiled at the boy none-the-less. </p><p>YEARS AFTER:</p><p>You have been living in Westeros for years now, and had since learned of your betrothal to Bran and even looked forward to the day you would marry your best friend.</p><p>It had taken quite some time to grasp how many things had to be done differently now that Bran couldn&rsquo;t use his legs. However, your love for him expanded even his paralysis. </p><p>You rushed through the woods as Bran followed on horseback-chasing you, a game you&rsquo;d started years ago.</p><p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t get me&rdquo; you taunted, as he laughed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m your lord, address me of such&rdquo; he ordered, still chuckling as his horse jaunted down the path. \u00a0&quot;You cant get me, my lord&quot; you added, rushing past the large tree until your foot caught a loose branch. </p><p>You fell to the ground in a heap and only looked up to see Bran laughing at you from atop his horse. </p><p>&ldquo;Are you alright?&rdquo; he asked, suddenly wishing he could only hop down from his horse and help you up, cursing his condition. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine&rdquo; you assure, standing and brushing yourself off, walking over to the stream to wipe the mud off your face. </p><p>&ldquo;Would you like to come down my lord?&rdquo; you ask, earning a quick nod from him. You stood to the side of the horse and went to work on the latches that held Bran&rsquo;s legs to the saddle. </p><p>You only stopped when you felt Bran&rsquo;s hands in your hair. You looked up at him and smiled. </p><p>You had no idea what he was going for but the touch didn&rsquo;t bother you in the slightest. </p><p>&ldquo;Bran?&rdquo; you hummed, curious and somehow amused by his vested interest. &ldquo;Yes Y/N&rdquo; he grinned, still playing with your hair. He didn&rsquo;t seem to want to stop and was getting too much joy out of tormenting you. &ldquo;Let me help you out&rdquo; you smiled, grabbing his much larger hand in your own. </p><p>You helped get him down from the saddle. You had gotten pretty good at helping him out, so it wasn&rsquo;t all that bothersome. </p><p>You set him down on the soft blanket you had packet earlier. &ldquo;Come here&rdquo; he suggested, from where he was propped up. &ldquo;What for?&rdquo; you asked, washing your face in the river. </p><p>&ldquo;Come here and sit with me&rdquo; he groaned, trying his hardest \u00a0to be convincing. It was the most painful thing, not being able to chase you down. Every moment he spent with you was on your own accord. </p><p>You nodded, moving over to sit beside him. You stopped once you thought you were close enough but Bran had different ideas. </p><p>&ldquo;Closer&rdquo; He whispered &ldquo;Bran-&rdquo; you started but he stops you before you could refuse. &ldquo;Come closer&rdquo; he repeats pulling you into him before continuing to watch the birds.</p><p>The two of you sat for a few hours and eventually fell asleep. You both kept sitting until you felt a hand cover your mouth.</p><p>You \u00a0tried to yell out for Bran but couldn&rsquo;t do it. </p><p>Not knowing what to do, you turned a knee into the man and he fell under the impact. Bran heard this and quickly stirred awake.</p><p>He jumped into action, grabbing his bow from his side and shot a single arrow into the mans jugular. You were quickly free from his grasp and back in Bran&rsquo;s arms.</p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go home&rdquo; he suggested, after checking you over, and making sure you were okay. </p><p>-</p><p>During the night you couldn&rsquo;t sleep. All you could think about was what had happened by the river with Bran. </p><p>You thought you should knock, but then decided against it in fear of waking the young prince.</p><p>You slowly opened the door and shivered again as the cold air hit you. As if the nightmares weren&rsquo;t bad enough, now it was freezing beyond belief. </p><p>&ldquo;Y/N&rdquo; Bran&rsquo;s voice echoed sleepily through the small room instantly forcing you to tense. \u00a0&quot;Bran, I know it is improper for me to be here now, but I was freezing and the nightmares wouldn&rsquo;t go away&quot; you say shivering again and he only smiled at you. </p><p>&ldquo;Well get over here&rdquo; he ordered, pulling the thick fur blanket open for you and patting the space that was left.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo; you whispered, and he smiles again. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure, now get up here, before you freeze to death&rdquo; he commands, opening his arms for you. </p><p>You laid down and wrapped the furs around your plump frame.

I was only riding with Sansa and Robb\u201d you defend, but she scowled at you none-the-less.</p><p>Catelyn couldn\u2019t stop her hatred for you, no matter how hard she tried. \u201cI want you to leave\u201d she spits with anger and hate in her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m sorry milady, I didn\u2019t mean to anger you\u201d You apologized, quickly hurrying out of the room. On your way, down the hall you rushed into Robb, and didn\u2019t even realize until he had you by the wrist, keeping you from the ground.</p><p>Of course it was bothersome for you, to have earned nothing but Lady Catelyn\u2019s aggression regardless of how hard you tried to make her like you. \u201cWhy are you in such a hurry for, aren\u2019t you going to see Bran?\u201d he asked, almost forcing you to burst into tears.</p><p>\u201cLady Catelyn wont let me see him, she says its my fault he is hurt \u201d You blubbered, normally you tried to save face but with something like Bran at stake, there was no way to do so. </p><p>\u201cHush now\u201d Robb whispered, pulling you into him. \u201cIt\u2019s not your fault\u201d he assured, hugging you into his chest as he tried his hardest to soothe you. </p><p>\u201cIts not your fault\u201d he repeated over and over before letting you up. It was crazy to him that his mother was willing to make you feel so guilty about something out of your control. \u201cCome now, stay behind me and we shall see him, just stay quiet\u201d he suggests, wrapping you simply in his cloak before leading you down the hall toward Bran\u2019s room.</p><p>\u201cMother\u201d you heard Robb bellow, before hearing only a whimper from Catelyn in reply.</p><p>\u201cHe is dead, that\u2019s all they say, he is dead\u201d She cries and you wince at the word \u201cHe isn\u2019t\u201d Robb assures her. You took this moment to peak through the fabric of his cloak, almost breaking down at the sight of your broken friend.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you angry with Y/N\u201d He asked, hiding your tense at his name. \u201cThis is her fault\u201d she spit, shutting down his words without so much as a breath. You would have run for the hills if she spoke to you that way, but Robb didn\u2019t falter. \u201cThis has nothing to do with her\u201d he reminded, his voice strong and commanding as he headed toward the door, with you on his heels. </p><p>\u201cShe truly does hate me\u201d You frowned, as soon as you stopped in the hall. Robb shook his head again \u201cShe is only hurt because she worries for him, don\u2019t take it personally\u201d he assured you, sending you off to find Arya.</p><p>If anyone was going to help you feel better after such a problem, it would be Arya. </p><p>-</p><p>Bran had woken a few weeks ago and you were hardly prepared for the news that his awakening would bring. </p><p>\u201cHe cannot walk\u201d Jon had informed you and you nearly choked \u201cHe cant walk\u201d you repeated, making sure you heard him right. Robb nodded, letting you know that the sick joke was the truth. \u201cCan I speak to him?\u201d your voice was slight, and careful as you implored the answer to both men. \u201cI will take you, you shouldn\u2019t go alone\u201d Robb nodded, taking your hand.</p><p>There was a good chance that even after all this time, Catelyn hadn\u2019t gotten over her upset and he wasn\u2019t going to throw you to the wolves alone. \u201cWill you come too Bran?\u201d you ask, earning an odd look from him. You and Jon had never been the closest but you needed all the support you could get right now.</p><p>When you all finally got to Bran\u2019s room, he was leaning on his bed side. \u201cBran\u201d you muttered, your words falling from your lips in a gasp, throwing yourself from the two men and onto the bed.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re alive\u201d you yelled, hugging him roughly, avoiding his legs but holding him tight in your arms. \u201cBarely\u201d he groaned, shrugging away from you quickly. It wasn\u2019t for the sake of you, but he was ashamed. </p><p>He was less of a man now. He wanted to marry you and build a strong home to raise your children in but who would want a cripple? </p><p>\u201cBran?\u201d you questioned, his behavior was odd and put you on edge. \u201cI can\u2019t walk, I\u2019m a cripple\u2026useless, I\u2019d rather be dead\u201d He barked, instantly earning a gasp from you. How dare he say something like that? You\u2019d been through so much over the last few months while he was unconscious, and now he felt inclined enough to say something so brash.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t ever say that Bran, you aren\u2019t a cripple, you survived\u201d you assured, running your hand over the side of his face, letting your touch relax him ever so slightly. You simply looking in his eyes, even though he didn\u2019t want to look in yours. \u201cLeave me\u201d he ordered and you frowned, but stepped off the bed anyway, past Jon and Robb out the door.</p><p>You wanted to support Bran but it didn\u2019t mean anything if he didn\u2019t want you to. Even you knew that much.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Robb yells toward Bran, the boy only looked at him blankly. Robb turned quickly to follow you, leaving Jon and Bran all alone.</p><p>\u201cCan I talk to you Bran?\u201d Jon asked, sitting beside his brother on the bed. The boy nodded, giving his brother as much of his attention as he could. \u201cDo you understand why Y/N is here?\u201d he asked, starting the conversation of simply.</p><p>Bran shook his head.</p><p>\u201cWell, when the time comes, you will marry her and she will live here in the north with you\u201d he explained, his attention poised on his brother \u201cSo she isn\u2019t my friend?\u201d he countered, not completely understanding what you were going with.</p><p>Jon chuckled, Bran really had no idea what was going on \u201cShe is but she is more than that, she is to be your wife, your lady\u201d finally, Bran nodded. He\u2019d heard of people being betrothed before, but never did he think about you in that compacity.</p><p>It took a few moments for the information to sink in and once it did, Bran had a secondary question. \u201cAnd I will love her?\u201d his words caught Jon off guard but he smiled at the boy none-the-less. </p><p>YEARS AFTER:</p><p>You have been living in Westeros for years now, and had since learned of your betrothal to Bran and even looked forward to the day you would marry your best friend.</p><p>It had taken quite some time to grasp how many things had to be done differently now that Bran couldn\u2019t use his legs. However, your love for him expanded even his paralysis. </p><p>You rushed through the woods as Bran followed on horseback-chasing you, a game you\u2019d started years ago.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t get me\u201d you taunted, as he laughed. \u201cI\u2019m your lord, address me of such\u201d he ordered, still chuckling as his horse jaunted down the path. \u00a0\"You cant get me, my lord\" you added, rushing past the large tree until your foot caught a loose branch. </p><p>You fell to the ground in a heap and only looked up to see Bran laughing at you from atop his horse. </p><p>\u201cAre you alright?\u201d he asked, suddenly wishing he could only hop down from his horse and help you up, cursing his condition. \u201cI\u2019m fine\u201d you assure, standing and brushing yourself off, walking over to the stream to wipe the mud off your face. </p><p>\u201cWould you like to come down my lord?\u201d you ask, earning a quick nod from him. You stood to the side of the horse and went to work on the latches that held Bran\u2019s legs to the saddle. </p><p>You only stopped when you felt Bran\u2019s hands in your hair. You looked up at him and smiled. </p><p>You had no idea what he was going for but the touch didn\u2019t bother you in the slightest. </p><p>\u201cBran?\u201d you hummed, curious and somehow amused by his vested interest. \u201cYes Y/N\u201d he grinned, still playing with your hair. He didn\u2019t seem to want to stop and was getting too much joy out of tormenting you. \u201cLet me help you out\u201d you smiled, grabbing his much larger hand in your own. </p><p>You helped get him down from the saddle. You had gotten pretty good at helping him out, so it wasn\u2019t all that bothersome. </p><p>You set him down on the soft blanket you had packet earlier. \u201cCome here\u201d he suggested, from where he was propped up. \u201cWhat for?\u201d you asked, washing your face in the river. </p><p>\u201cCome here and sit with me\u201d he groaned, trying his hardest \u00a0to be convincing. It was the most painful thing, not being able to chase you down. Every moment he spent with you was on your own accord. </p><p>You nodded, moving over to sit beside him. You stopped once you thought you were close enough but Bran had different ideas. </p><p>\u201cCloser\u201d He whispered \u201cBran-\u201d you started but he stops you before you could refuse. \u201cCome closer\u201d he repeats pulling you into him before continuing to watch the birds.</p><p>The two of you sat for a few hours and eventually fell asleep. You both kept sitting until you felt a hand cover your mouth.</p><p>You \u00a0tried to yell out for Bran but couldn\u2019t do it. </p><p>Not knowing what to do, you turned a knee into the man and he fell under the impact. Bran heard this and quickly stirred awake.</p><p>He jumped into action, grabbing his bow from his side and shot a single arrow into the mans jugular. You were quickly free from his grasp and back in Bran\u2019s arms.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go home\u201d he suggested, after checking you over, and making sure you were okay. </p><p>-</p><p>During the night you couldn\u2019t sleep. All you could think about was what had happened by the river with Bran. </p><p>You thought you should knock, but then decided against it in fear of waking the young prince.</p><p>You slowly opened the door and shivered again as the cold air hit you. As if the nightmares weren\u2019t bad enough, now it was freezing beyond belief. </p><p>\u201cY/N\u201d Bran\u2019s voice echoed sleepily through the small room instantly forcing you to tense. \u00a0\"Bran, I know it is improper for me to be here now, but I was freezing and the nightmares wouldn\u2019t go away\" you say shivering again and he only smiled at you. </p><p>\u201cWell get over here\u201d he ordered, pulling the thick fur blanket open for you and patting the space that was left.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d you whispered, and he smiles again. \u201cI\u2019m sure, now get up here, before you freeze to death\u201d he commands, opening his arms for you. </p><p>You laid down and wrapped the furs around your plump frame. Instantly you felt better. Bran\u2019s bed was warm and much bigger than yours, plus the fear was already fading just by being close to him. </p><p>You turned to face Bran and sucked in a breath. He was much closer to you now than he\u2019d ever been. \u201cCome here\u201d he repeated, sing the same phrase he had earlier that day. You let out a laugh at his antics \u201cI can\u2019t get any closer\u201d you informed, giving him a giggle. </p><p>\u201cFind a way\u201d </p><p>In succession with his words, Bran wrapped his arms around you and pulled you close to his frame, holding you tight. </p><p>\u201cBrandon\u201d You huffed, he looked at you, expecting some sort of reprimand but instead he grinned. The sound of his real name leaving your lips caught his attention, in the best way possible. </p><p>\u201cI think I love you\u201d you whispered, catching him off guard. You cuddled into his neck, your arms around his neck. </p><p>Normally it would have been alarming to admit your love to someone but for you and Bran it was second nature. The two of you were engaged to be married soon enough, so it didn\u2019t scare you at all. </p><p>He waited until you were sound asleep against his chest before answering you. \u00a0\"I have and will always love you\" he whispers, kissing your cheek and falling asleep.</p></p>",

He wanted to marry you and build a strong home to raise your children in but who would want a cripple? </p><p>\u201cBran?\u201d you questioned, his behavior was odd and put you on edge. \u201cI can\u2019t walk, I\u2019m a cripple\u2026useless, I\u2019d rather be dead\u201d He barked, instantly earning a gasp from you. How dare he say something like that? You\u2019d been through so much over the last few months while he was unconscious, and now he felt inclined enough to say something so brash.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t ever say that Bran, you aren\u2019t a cripple, you survived\u201d you assured, running your hand over the side of his face, letting your touch relax him ever so slightly. You simply looking in his eyes, even though he didn\u2019t want to look in yours. \u201cLeave me\u201d he ordered and you frowned, but stepped off the bed anyway, past Jon and Robb out the door.</p><p>You wanted to support Bran but it didn\u2019t mean anything if he didn\u2019t want you to. Even you knew that much.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Robb yells toward Bran, the boy only looked at him blankly. Robb turned quickly to follow you, leaving Jon and Bran all alone.</p><p>\u201cCan I talk to you Bran?\u201d Jon asked, sitting beside his brother on the bed. The boy nodded, giving his brother as much of his attention as he could. \u201cDo you understand why Y/N is here?\u201d he asked, starting the conversation of simply.</p><p>Bran shook his head.</p><p>\u201cWell, when the time comes, you will marry her and she will live here in the north with you\u201d he explained, his attention poised on his brother \u201cSo she isn\u2019t my friend?\u201d he countered, not completely understanding what you were going with.</p><p>Jon chuckled, Bran really had no idea what was going on \u201cShe is but she is more than that, she is to be your wife, your lady\u201d finally, Bran nodded. He\u2019d heard of people being betrothed before, but never did he think about you in that compacity.</p><p>It took a few moments for the information to sink in and once it did, Bran had a secondary question. \u201cAnd I will love her?\u201d his words caught Jon off guard but he smiled at the boy none-the-less. </p><p>YEARS AFTER:</p><p>You have been living in Westeros for years now, and had since learned of your betrothal to Bran and even looked forward to the day you would marry your best friend.</p><p>It had taken quite some time to grasp how many things had to be done differently now that Bran couldn\u2019t use his legs. However, your love for him expanded even his paralysis. </p><p>You rushed through the woods as Bran followed on horseback-chasing you, a game you\u2019d started years ago.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t get me\u201d you taunted, as he laughed. \u201cI\u2019m your lord, address me of such\u201d he ordered, still chuckling as his horse jaunted down the path. \u00a0\"You cant get me, my lord\" you added, rushing past the large tree until your foot caught a loose branch. </p><p>You fell to the ground in a heap and only looked up to see Bran laughing at you from atop his horse. </p><p>\u201cAre you alright?\u201d he asked, suddenly wishing he could only hop down from his horse and help you up, cursing his condition. \u201cI\u2019m fine\u201d you assure, standing and brushing yourself off, walking over to the stream to wipe the mud off your face. </p><p>\u201cWould you like to come down my lord?\u201d you ask, earning a quick nod from him. You stood to the side of the horse and went to work on the latches that held Bran\u2019s legs to the saddle. </p><p>You only stopped when you felt Bran\u2019s hands in your hair. You looked up at him and smiled. </p><p>You had no idea what he was going for but the touch didn\u2019t bother you in the slightest. </p><p>\u201cBran?\u201d you hummed, curious and somehow amused by his vested interest. \u201cYes Y/N\u201d he grinned, still playing with your hair. He didn\u2019t seem to want to stop and was getting too much joy out of tormenting you. \u201cLet me help you out\u201d you smiled, grabbing his much larger hand in your own. </p><p>You helped get him down from the saddle. You had gotten pretty good at helping him out, so it wasn\u2019t all that bothersome. </p><p>You set him down on the soft blanket you had packet earlier. \u201cCome here\u201d he suggested, from where he was propped up. \u201cWhat for?\u201d you asked, washing your face in the river. </p><p>\u201cCome here and sit with me\u201d he groaned, trying his hardest \u00a0to be convincing. It was the most painful thing, not being able to chase you down. Every moment he spent with you was on your own accord. </p><p>You nodded, moving over to sit beside him. You stopped once you thought you were close enough but Bran had different ideas. </p><p>\u201cCloser\u201d He whispered \u201cBran-\u201d you started but he stops you before you could refuse. \u201cCome closer\u201d he repeats pulling you into him before continuing to watch the birds.</p><p>The two of you sat for a few hours and eventually fell asleep. You both kept sitting until you felt a hand cover your mouth.</p><p>You \u00a0tried to yell out for Bran but couldn\u2019t do it. </p><p>Not knowing what to do, you turned a knee into the man and he fell under the impact. Bran heard this and quickly stirred awake.</p><p>He jumped into action, grabbing his bow from his side and shot a single arrow into the mans jugular. You were quickly free from his grasp and back in Bran\u2019s arms.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go home\u201d he suggested, after checking you over, and making sure you were okay. </p><p>-</p><p>During the night you couldn\u2019t sleep. All you could think about was what had happened by the river with Bran. </p><p>You thought you should knock, but then decided against it in fear of waking the young prince.</p><p>You slowly opened the door and shivered again as the cold air hit you. As if the nightmares weren\u2019t bad enough, now it was freezing beyond belief. </p><p>\u201cY/N\u201d Bran\u2019s voice echoed sleepily through the small room instantly forcing you to tense. \u00a0\"Bran, I know it is improper for me to be here now, but I was freezing and the nightmares wouldn\u2019t go away\" you say shivering again and he only smiled at you. </p><p>\u201cWell get over here\u201d he ordered, pulling the thick fur blanket open for you and patting the space that was left.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d you whispered, and he smiles again. \u201cI\u2019m sure, now get up here, before you freeze to death\u201d he commands, opening his arms for you. </p><p>You laid down and wrapped the furs around your plump frame. Instantly you felt better. Bran\u2019s bed was warm and much bigger than yours, plus the fear was already fading just by being close to him. </p><p>You turned to face Bran and sucked in a breath. He was much closer to you now than he\u2019d ever been. \u201cCome here\u201d he repeated, sing the same phrase he had earlier that day. You let out a laugh at his antics \u201cI can\u2019t get any closer\u201d you informed, giving him a giggle. </p><p>\u201cFind a way\u201d </p><p>In succession with his words, Bran wrapped his arms around you and pulled you close to his frame, holding you tight. </p><p>\u201cBrandon\u201d You huffed, he looked at you, expecting some sort of reprimand but instead he grinned. The sound of his real name leaving your lips caught his attention, in the best way possible. </p><p>\u201cI think I love you\u201d you whispered, catching him off guard. You cuddled into his neck, your arms around his neck. </p><p>Normally it would have been alarming to admit your love to someone but for you and Bran it was second nature. The two of you were engaged to be married soon enough, so it didn\u2019t scare you at all. </p><p>He waited until you were sound asleep against his chest before answering you. \u00a0\"I have and will always love you\" he whispers, kissing your cheek and falling asleep.</p></p>",

I was only riding with Sansa and Robb&rdquo; you defend, but she scowled at you none-the-less.</p><p>Catelyn couldn&rsquo;t stop her hatred for you, no matter how hard she tried. &ldquo;I want you to leave&rdquo; she spits with anger and hate in her eyes. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry milady, I didn&rsquo;t mean to anger you&rdquo; You apologized, quickly hurrying out of the room. On your way, down the hall you rushed into Robb, and didn&rsquo;t even realize until he had you by the wrist, keeping you from the ground.</p><p>Of course it was bothersome for you, to have earned nothing but Lady Catelyn&rsquo;s aggression regardless of how hard you tried to make her like you. &ldquo;Why are you in such a hurry for, aren&rsquo;t you going to see Bran?&rdquo; he asked, almost forcing you to burst into tears.</p><p>&ldquo;Lady Catelyn wont let me see him, she says its my fault he is hurt &rdquo; You blubbered, normally you tried to save face but with something like Bran at stake, there was no way to do so. </p><p>&ldquo;Hush now&rdquo; Robb whispered, pulling you into him. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not your fault&rdquo; he assured, hugging you into his chest as he tried his hardest to soothe you. </p><p>&ldquo;Its not your fault&rdquo; he repeated over and over before letting you up. It was crazy to him that his mother was willing to make you feel so guilty about something out of your control. &ldquo;Come now, stay behind me and we shall see him, just stay quiet&rdquo; he suggests, wrapping you simply in his cloak before leading you down the hall toward Bran&rsquo;s room.</p><p>&ldquo;Mother&rdquo; you heard Robb bellow, before hearing only a whimper from Catelyn in reply.</p><p>&ldquo;He is dead, that&rsquo;s all they say, he is dead&rdquo; She cries and you wince at the word &ldquo;He isn&rsquo;t&rdquo; Robb assures her. You took this moment to peak through the fabric of his cloak, almost breaking down at the sight of your broken friend.</p><p>&ldquo;Why are you angry with Y/N&rdquo; He asked, hiding your tense at his name. &ldquo;This is her fault&rdquo; she spit, shutting down his words without so much as a breath. You would have run for the hills if she spoke to you that way, but Robb didn&rsquo;t falter. &ldquo;This has nothing to do with her&rdquo; he reminded, his voice strong and commanding as he headed toward the door, with you on his heels. </p><p>&ldquo;She truly does hate me&rdquo; You frowned, as soon as you stopped in the hall. Robb shook his head again &ldquo;She is only hurt because she worries for him, don&rsquo;t take it personally&rdquo; he assured you, sending you off to find Arya.</p><p>If anyone was going to help you feel better after such a problem, it would be Arya. </p><p>-</p><p>Bran had woken a few weeks ago and you were hardly prepared for the news that his awakening would bring. </p><p>&ldquo;He cannot walk&rdquo; Jon had informed you and you nearly choked &ldquo;He cant walk&rdquo; you repeated, making sure you heard him right. Robb nodded, letting you know that the sick joke was the truth. &ldquo;Can I speak to him?&rdquo; your voice was slight, and careful as you implored the answer to both men. &ldquo;I will take you, you shouldn&rsquo;t go alone&rdquo; Robb nodded, taking your hand.</p><p>There was a good chance that even after all this time, Catelyn hadn&rsquo;t gotten over her upset and he wasn&rsquo;t going to throw you to the wolves alone. &ldquo;Will you come too Bran?&rdquo; you ask, earning an odd look from him. You and Jon had never been the closest but you needed all the support you could get right now.</p><p>When you all finally got to Bran&rsquo;s room, he was leaning on his bed side. &ldquo;Bran&rdquo; you muttered, your words falling from your lips in a gasp, throwing yourself from the two men and onto the bed.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re alive&rdquo; you yelled, hugging him roughly, avoiding his legs but holding him tight in your arms. &ldquo;Barely&rdquo; he groaned, shrugging away from you quickly.
