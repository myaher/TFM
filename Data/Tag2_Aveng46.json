Why should I care enough to spend another several hours re-writing this? Because it is not ok to call survivors of traumatic events damaged. Period. End of story. It was a lousy choice of words that could easily be misinterpreted, and I would have been willing to leave it at that, if the writers and directors didn\u2019t keep talking and digging that hole a little deeper. So&hellip;here we go. Again. I\u2019m on my soapbox and the view is great.<br/></p><hr><p>In less than an hour of screen time over seven films, the Marvel Cinematic Universe gave us a complex, beloved character that walks the line between victim and villain with a murder-strut swagger. Bucky Barnes is as lonesome and dangerous as he is charming and sarcastic. Many fans have fallen in love or seen themselves reflected in Bucky\u2019s trials and triumphs; he\u2019s truly an <i>awesome, </i>multi-faceted character, but unfortunately, fans seem to be of the few who realize this. </p><p>Recent comments made by both <a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DdwjLg1lLPGk&amp;t=NzIwYWUxNTZjZDQzNmI4NTRiOTQ1NDcxYWEyMGYzODY0Y2RlODY2MyxHSEFXSTZSSw%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AHnO60SCYXkILH8u3EypVLA&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fpanthergyrl.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F184702468226%2Fwhy-bucky-barnes-isnt-damaged-goods&amp;m=1\" target=\"_blank\">MCU directors</a> and <a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DVg2AZcC_-sA&amp;t=OTEzMzFkZDcxOTIzYjMzY2Q5MTY5NWJkMjg2MGRmMmU4ZGQ2NjE1ZixHSEFXSTZSSw%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AHnO60SCYXkILH8u3EypVLA&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fpanthergyrl.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F184702468226%2Fwhy-bucky-barnes-isnt-damaged-goods&amp;m=1\" target=\"_blank\">writers</a> regarding Bucky\u2019s mental state have\u2026<i>bothered</i> me and I thought, well, let\u2019s examine the evidence that Bucky is damaged, shall we? </p><!-- more --><p><i>Obligatory disclaimer: I am not a mental health professional; I have PTSD and use these strategies myself, but nothing I\u2019ve written should preclude you from seeking a professional opinion if you need it. Talking with a therapist about my PTSD helped me get light years ahead in terms of recovery. Whatever path you choose, take care of you. </i></p><h2><b>What is PTSD?</b></h2><p>Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a mental health condition that&rsquo;s triggered by a terrifying event \u2014 either experiencing it or witnessing it. </p><h2><b>Does Bucky Barnes have PTSD?</b></h2><p>By definition, Bucky has experienced or witnessed the following traumatic events:</p><ul><li><b>WWII</b>. Bucky served as an active soldier during WWII, in the trenches and on the battlefields. He was a distinguished sniper and a Sergeant, which means he witnessed and contributed to the war effort to an even further degree. Many soldiers had \u201cbattle fatigue\u201d or \u201cshell shock\u201d during the war; it is not unlikely that Bucky would have experienced this from WWII alone if he had survived and returned home. </li>\n<li><b>Prisoner of War</b>. Bucky was captured and tortured as a prisoner of war, not once, but <i>twice</i>. He was experimented on in his time in Azzano, before he was captured again by Zola/Hydra. </li>\n<li><b>The Fall. </b>Bucky shouldn\u2019t have survived the fall from the train in the Alps. He watched as Steve tried to save him and failed, and he was cognizant as he fell to his presumed death and as he was then captured.</li><li><b>Disability. </b>As established in flashback scenes, Bucky was conscious when he fell from the train and as he was being pulled through the snow by his captors (who he may have assumed were saviors at that point, double ouch). He woke up to his arm being removed and replaced. This kind of permanent change to his body would be difficult enough to work through in a peaceful recovery environment. We know that Bucky didn\u2019t get that luxury.</li><li><b>Hydra/The Winter Soldier decades. </b>The cryochamber. Being strapped to a table and experimented on. <i>The chair. </i>Having no control over your own mind or body. Being forced to murder; being trapped in a continuous war. This torture lasted for <i>70 years</i>.</li><li><b>Civil War. </b>Free from Hydra, Bucky is trying to live the good life, keep his head down, and stay out of trouble. Then boom, he\u2019s blamed for a bombing that kills how many people? And he\u2019s right in the middle of Tony and Steve\u2019s fallout? Oh, and he loses his arm, <i>again</i>? And then he willingly goes back into cryofreeze? Ok. That\u2019s like 16 traumatic events in the space of 24-48 hours, also known as Bucky Barnes and the No Good Very Bad Day.</li><li><b>Battle Against Thanos and The Snapture, Part 1.</b> Just as Bucky gets to the point where he\u2019s living the good live and recovering from the trauma that has been <i>pretty much his entire life</i>, Thanos shows up, and Bucky is off to another battlefield. Then, he dies. Sort of. Again. How many times is this now?</li>\n<li><b>Battle Against Thanos and The Snapture, Part 2. </b>Bucky gets unsnapped and has approximately two seconds of \u201cyay!\u201d before he is <i>again </i>fighting on a battlefield for his life and the lives of those he cares about and oh, for the entire world. </li>\n</ul><p>A common thread here is that all of these traumatic experiences included a near brush with death or a near constant threat to his person. We don\u2019t even <i>really know </i>the extent of the trauma Bucky endured when he was captured by Hydra. Regardless, I just listed eight different traumatic events that Bucky has experienced or witnessed. I think, yes, it\u2019s safe to say that poor Bucky has PTSD, big-time. </p><h2><b>So, is Bucky Barnes damaged?</b></h2><p><b>No.</b> Bucky Barnes is an individual who have survived more than his fair share of traumatic events, and as such, his brain has had to compensate for how he thinks, processes, and responds to stimuli. He does, at one point, suffer from literal brain damage from the chair, but we are shown in\u00a0<i>Black Panther</i> that Shuri has healed the physical damage to his brain. </p><p>If Bucky experienced permanent damage from his trauma, he would be incapable of living his life. Literally. If he suffered from PTSD and did not actively try to take measures to cope with it, he would not be able to function; his brain wouldn\u2019t let him. (In my opinion, he still would not be \u201cdamaged\u201d because people with mental health issues are still people who deserve respect and shouldn\u2019t be talked about like feral animals, but hey, moving past ableist language is apparently too much to ask and I digress). </p><p>Anyways, my point is that Bucky is not only aware of his condition, but actively takes steps to treat it, therefore, he cannot be of a damaged mind. And I\u2019m gonna prove it. </p><h2><b>Bucky Barnes: PTSD Symptoms and Coping Strategies</b></h2><p>Bucky exhibits both positive and negative coping strategies throughout the films as his journey to recovery progresses, sometimes back to back, which is a great, realistic choice, because it shows that recovery is not linear.</p><p><b>Avoidance</b></p><p><i>Avoidance occurs when a person avoids thoughts or feelings about a traumatic event; it can interfere with emotional recovery and healing and is a common reaction to trauma. </i></p><p>The first step in treating any illness is recognizing the need for treatment. In <i>Captain America: The First Avenger</i> we see Bucky actively avoid recognizing his trauma after being rescued from Azzano. He\u2019s putting on a strong face in the name of avoidance (\u201cLet\u2019s hear it for Captain America!\u201d) but he\u2019s also suffering.</p><figure data-orig-height=\"216\" data-orig-width=\"245\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/c58d2f6c3ba2870f2e25ec54fec3da81/tumblr_n4cct525W41sa1dj7o6_250.gif\" data-orig-height=\"216\" data-orig-width=\"245\"/></figure><figure data-orig-width=\"245\" data-orig-height=\"216\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/0499d9d93a967d0a7bd21b6f03d86e05/tumblr_n4cct525W41sa1dj7o4_250.gif\" data-orig-width=\"245\" data-orig-height=\"216\"/></figure><p><i>Source: <a href=\"https://cogentranting.tumblr.com/post/174225812218/comic-bucky-phdna-bluandorange-edgebug\" target=\"_blank\">https://cogentranting.tumblr.com/post/174225812218/comic-bucky-phdna-bluandorange-edgebug</a></i><br/></p><p>There\u2019s an additional scene in this film that, while played for laughs and parallels between Bucky and Steve, has always meant more to me. When the Howlies are all gathered in a bar, drinking, laughing, and having a good time, Bucky is by himself in the back room (avoiding friends) where it\u2019s quiet (avoiding loud disturbances that could rock him) and he can keep an eye on his surroundings (being overly alert). His uniform is disheveled and he\u2019s lost that cocky Sergeant Barnes signature look. When Peggy walks in and completely ignores him, this is Bucky\u2019s reaction:</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"252\" data-orig-width=\"540\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/59323e222f7e6a2278cfcfe090e5bd9f/tumblr_pkxs5ud5CR1wmht7po3_540.gif\" data-orig-height=\"252\" data-orig-width=\"540\"/></figure><p><i>Source: <a href=\"https://steviebarnes.tumblr.com/post/181821865007/steve-little-shit-rogers\" target=\"_blank\">https://steviebarnes.tumblr.com/post/181821865007/steve-little-shit-rogers</a></i><br/></p><p>I don\u2019t think Bucky was exaggerating here. Everything he\u2019s been through lately <i>is</i> a horrible dream. We don\u2019t talk about this scene enough in terms of how it shows Bucky\u2019s vulnerability; it\u2019s really the first hint we have that Bucky has lost a part of himself during this war. </p><p><b>Engaging in Dangerous Behavior/Overworking</b></p><p>In <i>Captain America: The First Avenger</i>, we witness Bucky deploying a negative coping strategy for the first time: over dedication to his work that suggests he\u2019s overcompensating as a way of avoiding thinking about his trauma. Engaging in reckless or dangerous behavior also is a symptom of PTSD. Bucky continuously experiences new stressful situations, which ultimately will extend his healing time. For example, he willingly goes on a mission to capture Zola, the man who strapped him to a lab table and pumped him full of knock-off super soldier serum. Seeing the doctor again would be enough to trigger Bucky into an episode but he goes anyways because his dedication to the mission is more important to him than his mental stability.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"248\" data-orig-width=\"500\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/9ee5d2f7c728f6ba2e800e7569d37007/tumblr_p3owclz8R51ub5aypo2_500.gif\" data-orig-height=\"248\" data-orig-width=\"500\"/></figure><p><i>Source: <a href=\"https://n-barnes.tumblr.com/post/170542194046/bucky-with-the-guns\" target=\"_blank\">https://n-barnes.tumblr.com/post/170542194046/bucky-with-the-guns</a></i></p><p>Now, this is still an active war zone. The necessity of the Howling Commando missions to win the war means that Bucky doesn\u2019t really have time to process what\u2019s happened to him; he\u2019s incapable of coping in a healthy way at this point and charging forward, continuing to work, is the only way he knows how to survive. </p><p>Bucky has a bad habit of not avoiding his triggers when he feels the mission is more important than his mental health. A common theme throughout every film is that Bucky is put into one dangerous situation right after another, usually immediately following a five minute breather.</p><p>In <i>Captain America: The Winter Soldier, </i>we see glimpses of Bucky Winter being pulled in and out of cryofreeze, placed on mission after mission. The one time we begin to see that there\u2019s more to Winter than they\u2019d have us believe is when Bucky\u2019s memories surface for a hot minute in the bank vault. He has about 30 seconds of downtime where he\u2019s aware and then\u2026wipe him. Back on the mission to kill Captain America. Everything about his time as the Winter Soldier was dangerous; it\u2019s not like Hydra really cared about his physical or mental health. All those years of trauma and overworking probably crashed down on Bucky, hard, the moment he was in control of his own mind again and able to rest. And his brain was in physical shambles on top of it. Poor Bucky.</p><figure data-orig-height=\"380\" data-orig-width=\"245\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/ab5f2c5df065e51a1a90dc5c3df8f11c/tumblr_n9qfmnNt781qe8a0fo4_250.gif\" data-orig-height=\"380\" data-orig-width=\"245\"/></figure><p><i>Source: <a href=\"https://mishasteaparty.tumblr.com/post/93678343244/prep-him\" target=\"_blank\">https://mishasteaparty.tumblr.com/post/93678343244/prep-him</a></i><br/></p><p>Similarly, in <i>Captain America: Civil War</i>, we get this amazing scene:</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"199\" data-orig-width=\"500\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/fbeb1cc06367214fb50e88290f244c18/tumblr_pcp2nxEVDs1vr4zyso1_500.gif\" data-orig-height=\"199\" data-orig-width=\"500\"/></figure><p><i>Source: <a href=\"https://mackievanstan.tumblr.com/post/176453875698/let-him-rest\" target=\"_blank\">https://mackievanstan.tumblr.com/post/176453875698/let-him-rest</a></i><br/></p><p>And another in <i>Avengers: Infinity War</i>:</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"199\" data-orig-width=\"500\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/0b98479a968eee477eb7828be8afb6bd/tumblr_pcp2nxEVDs1vr4zyso2_500.gif\" data-orig-height=\"199\" data-orig-width=\"500\"/></figure><p><i>Source: <a href=\"https://mackievanstan.tumblr.com/post/176453875698/let-him-rest\" target=\"_blank\">https://mackievanstan.tumblr.com/post/176453875698/let-him-rest</a></i><br/></p><p>Once again, Bucky keeps getting thrown back into the middle of a fight when he needs to be resting. This is a very, very bad idea. Super bad. Could really fuck with Bucky\u2019s mental health permanently, bad. This is pretty much the definition of overworking to a detrimental degree.</p><p>But what I really love about his reactions in both of these scenes is that he <i>knows</i> exactly how poor of an idea it is. He knows continuing to fight isn\u2019t good for him and he\u2019s <i>exhausted</i>. He goes willingly anyways, but he has this amazing control over himself at this point. Every single fight could have Bucky experiencing an episode and losing himself to the trauma; he doesn\u2019t. (To be fair, I think this is what the Russos were hinting at but they could have worded it so much better). Bucky could have walked away. He could have surrendered in Bucharest, he could have hidden in Wakanda. He fought anyways. </p><p>This shows just how complex Bucky\u2019s PTSD really is and how well he\u2019s coping with it: he\u2019s engaging in dangerous behaviors which could trigger him, but he\u2019s doing so with awareness and self-actualization. He\u2019s got a handle on himself. These coping behaviors directly contradict the Russos\u2019 statement that you \u201cdon\u2019t want to give another weapon to that guy, it could end up being used the wrong way.\u201d With the exception of being literally triggered with the Winter Soldier code words (which are no longer a threat because good job, Shuri), Bucky fights the good fight every single time. He doesn\u2019t go rogue. He doesn\u2019t lose himself.</p><p>Yeah, if that doesn\u2019t make him a hero, I don\u2019t know what further proof I can provide, because he does this in literally every single film. </p><p><b>Active Coping</b></p><p><i>Active coping means accepting the impact of trauma on your life, taking direct action to improve things, and creating habits that help you respond to everyday life in a positive manner. Avoiding triggers - people, places, anniversaries, or other reminders of the traumatic event - can be a healthy coping strategy.</i></p><p>The first time we see Bucky take a step toward positive active coping is in <i>Captain America: The Winter Soldier</i>:</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"209\" data-orig-width=\"500\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/9c0642733691551ab306517b72cd38d1/tumblr_inline_oa0yo8GXRe1r4kfs0_500.gif\" data-orig-height=\"209\" data-orig-width=\"500\"/></figure><p><i>Source: <a href=\"https://thatpleasantnightmare.tumblr.com/post/147118407198\" target=\"_blank\">https://thatpleasantnightmare.tumblr.com/post/147118407198</a></i><br/></p><p>Bucky just escaped being a prisoner, was injured in a gruesome fight with his best friend, and is now on the run. What\u2019s one of the first things he does? Research. More than that, in this scene, Bucky is clean, in civilian clothing of his choosing, and appears to have treated his injuries from the fight on the carriers. His eyes are clear and although he is in a public (read: dangerous) setting, he\u2019s aware of his surroundings, has a calm grip on reality, and is processing information. This is Bucky taking the first step to actively reclaiming his identity. This is when we see him begin to heal and <i>he\u2019s doing it on his own</i>. He\u2019s on step one of learning to actively cope: <i>accepting the impact of the trauma on your life. </i></p><p>Bucky continues to exhibit positive coping strategies on his own as time moves forward, as we see in <i>Captain America: Civil War</i>. By the time we meet up with Bucky in Romania, he\u2019s already taken direct action to improve his situation. When we first see Bucky, he\u2019s at a local market, smiling and engaging in conversation with a vendor while he buys produce.

As he\u2019s trying for normal, he\u2019s also <b>hyper aware of his surroundings</b>, unwilling to let his guard down. He\u2019s scanning for anything that could trigger him or endanger his health, but he is aware. <b>Staying alert and on guard</b> is a classic symptom of PTSD.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"220\" data-orig-width=\"500\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/26ad939f06cc27f9ca2b65697ee4df5d/tumblr_inline_o7e4luA6GY1qac49s_500.gif\" data-orig-height=\"220\" data-orig-width=\"500\"/></figure><p><i>Source: <a href=\"https://kittyseb.tumblr.com/post/144559460240/this-whole-scene-of-bucky-on-the-streets-of\" target=\"_blank\">https://kittyseb.tumblr.com/post/144559460240/this-whole-scene-of-bucky-on-the-streets-of</a></i><br/></p><p>However, we have to understand that Bucky\u2019s situation requires this sort of hyper vigilance. He\u2019s a wanted man, both by Hydra and the CIA, and he\u2019s actively being hunted. So although Bucky is displaying a classic symptom of PTSD, what we see here is him deploying a positive strategy for coping. By staying aware to his surroundings, he\u2019s protecting himself. This is opposite to the kind of harmful behavior we should expect from him at this point in his recovery. He\u2019s by himself, without any support, and has to look over his shoulder every block to make sure that he\u2019s safe. Extreme hyper vigilance would show being Bucky afraid to leave his apartment altogether. Again, while he is suffering and displaying symptoms of active post traumatic stress, he\u2019s also actively coping by taking direct action to improve his circumstances and creating habits that improve his daily life.</p><p>Through the entirety of the Romania scene in <i>Captain America: Civil War</i>, we catch glimpses of other healthy habits and positive coping strategies Bucky has developed.</p><p><b>Practicing Mindfulness</b></p><p>One really great blink-and-you-miss-it detail from the film is the existence of Bucky\u2019s journals. As Steve goes through Bucky\u2019s stuff (really, Steve?), you see him pick up a journal from the top of Bucky\u2019s fridge. Inside are notes, memories, and references, categorized and marked by tabs. This is one of my favorite examples of Bucky using another strategy for coping with PTSD: <b>mindfulness</b>. </p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"595\" data-orig-width=\"1054\" style=\"\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/044f5266e086cab2a5cf8462b2dbecf7/tumblr_inline_prgo2chxYj1qzh4ks_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"595\" data-orig-width=\"1054\"/></figure><p><i>Source: a shitty screenshot I took from the movie.</i></p><p><i>Mindfulness: a mental state achieved by focusing one&rsquo;s awareness on the present moment, while calmly acknowledging and accepting one&rsquo;s feelings, thoughts, and bodily sensations, used as a therapeutic technique. Mindfulness may help people get back in touch with the present moment, as well as reduce the extent with which they feel controlled by unpleasant thoughts and memories.</i></p><p>This is an extremely positive practice for Bucky, because at this point in the films, he\u2019s still suffering from brain damage and memory loss. We see several examples of Bucky shaking his head, blinking, and losing himself to possible memories throughout the films. Journaling, as a way to capture those memories, categorize them, and begin rebuilding a timeline of his life, can help Bucky identify his triggers, work through episodes, and ultimately distinguish between past memories and the present, enabling him to regain control of his mind. </p><p><b>Maintaining a Healthy Lifestyle</b></p><p>When Bucky appears on screen, we see that he\u2019s physically fit and obviously taking care of himself. We can assume that during his time as the Winter Soldier, Hydra kept Bucky in peak physical condition in order to succeed in every mission. Whether that was through training, supplements, drugs, the super soldier serum, etc., we don\u2019t know. We don\u2019t see Bucky continuing this training, but we do see the results of it. He\u2019s capable of fighting, obviously maintaining his strength, and he\u2019s able to run away.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"230\" data-orig-width=\"540\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/6245738d1095eff637cea557e61f89ba/tumblr_ocw9qm6MhD1vujk9vo3_540.gif\" data-orig-height=\"230\" data-orig-width=\"540\"/></figure><p><i>Source: <a href=\"https://captaincentenarian.tumblr.com/post/149852437382/bucky-running-majestic-hair-appreciation\" target=\"_blank\">https://captaincentenarian.tumblr.com/post/149852437382/bucky-running-majestic-hair-appreciation</a></i><br/></p><p>We also witness Bucky making healthy choices in terms of food. He\u2019s got energy/protein bars in his apartment, snacks readily available, pots and pans which would imply he has been cooking, and even a thermos to keep himself hydrated. He\u2019s doing his best to maintain his physical health, which in and of itself is a very positive coping method. He could be depressed, lost in his own mind, never getting out of bed. But Bucky wants to survive, he wants to be better, and so he takes care of himself. This is a good thing.</p><p>If you haven\u2019t seen it, <a href=\"https://steverogersnotebook.tumblr.com/post/144079797515/buckys-apartment-was-oriented-intentionally-by\" target=\"_blank\">please read this post about Bucky\u2019s apartment</a>, because it hits on so many great points about how Bucky is taking care of himself.</p><p><b>Recognizing and Avoiding Triggers</b></p><p>Now for as many positive steps Bucky has taken to actively cope with having PTSD, he\u2019s got awful luck when it comes to avoiding his triggers. It\u2019s two steps forward, one step back, every time. </p><p>At the beginning of <i>Captain America: Civil War</i>, Bucky is trying his damndest to avoid being caught. But stupid Zemo has other plans.</p><p>Look, it\u2019s hard for me to describe what happens next in the film. The way that Sebastian played these scenes will never <i>not</i> give me chills. We get an up close and personal view of Bucky\u2019s PTSD in ways we\u2019ve only caught glimpses of up until now; I don\u2019t know what Sebastian researched in order to create this performance, but it is so spot on that it\u2019s difficult to watch. I wish he got more credit for his acting and it\u2019s a damn waste that he only had 30 seconds of screen time in subsequent movies. *sigh*</p><p>Anyways&hellip;</p><p>We see the acceptance and the fear in Bucky\u2019s eyes as the CIA takes him into custody. He\u2019s maintaining his composure, more than he should be capable of doing at this point, and he\u2019s also letting himself slip into a safe zone (\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about it.\u201d). Until Zemo begins reading the trigger words. </p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"235\" data-orig-width=\"540\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/a06a93cc16ee3c578c5498dbf3d30c4e/tumblr_pc1kujlI121wzvtqio3_540.gif\" data-orig-height=\"235\" data-orig-width=\"540\"/></figure><p><i>Source: <a href=\"https://cvssian.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">https://cvssian.tumblr.com/</a></i></p><p>Good grief, y\u2019all. Look at him struggling. Bucky literally tried to fight his way out of being triggered, but he failed. Every fear he\u2019s had for the past several years is happening. He\u2019s losing control of his mind, of everything he\u2019s worked so hard for up to this point. I don\u2019t want to look too far into this as a commentary on Bucky\u2019s character, because I don\u2019t think the writers meant for it to be the deep - it serves more as a plot point to get us to the war part of <i>Civil War</i> - but if you stop and examine it for just a second, this scene is an absolute outrage. I can\u2019t believe this happened to Bucky\u2019s mind. They turned him into a weapon, again. They stripped him of <i>years</i> of hard work and recovery. </p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"240\" data-orig-width=\"540\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/3d36d14020b2e822be1b642077ac5225/tumblr_pkiff3pLOx1uhh267o4_540.gif\" data-orig-height=\"240\" data-orig-width=\"540\"/></figure><p><i>Source: <a href=\"https://brolinjosh.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">https://brolinjosh.tumblr.com/</a><br/></i></p><p>Thankfully - <i>thankfully</i> - one quick hit to the head later, and Bucky\u2019s back. Not only is he aware of his surroundings, he\u2019s cognizant enough to try playing dumb to Sam and Steve at first. I like the conversation that takes place between Bucky and Steve here, because Bucky was smart enough to give Steve exactly what he needed to hear to prove that Bucky was no longer a threat. We don\u2019t talk about Bucky\u2019s raw intelligence enough, likely because we\u2019re always talking about his grief, and this scene gives us one of the rare moments in the film where we get to witness Bucky strategizing. He was <i>just </i>triggered, his brain is mush, he just lost control of himself, and then <i>immediately</i> after, he\u2019s back on mission. We\u2019re back to avoidance/no time to process. Bucky tucks being triggered as Winter into his back pocket to be dealt with on another day. </p><p>Remember how I said Bucky keeps getting thrown into fights, one after another? Guess what.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"230\" data-orig-width=\"540\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/bc6e53d9b77140d1d0c9e0524eecc093/tumblr_ocw9qm6MhD1vujk9vo7_540.gif\" data-orig-height=\"230\" data-orig-width=\"540\"/></figure><p><i>Source: <a href=\"https://captaincentenarian.tumblr.com/post/149852437382/bucky-running-majestic-hair-appreciation\" target=\"_blank\">https://captaincentenarian.tumblr.com/post/149852437382/bucky-running-majestic-hair-appreciation</a></i><br/></p><p>There are a lot of significant, interesting parallels happening between <i>Captain America: The First Avenger</i> and <i>Captain America: Civil War</i>. The plot goes like this: Bucky was captured and actively tortured; Steve rescued him; they have no time to discuss what\u2019s just happened and deal with it; and then Bucky is forced into another fight before he\u2019s ready. </p><p>We can draw a lot of comparisons between the Howlies and Team Cap here and I wish that they had made the effort to explore this more in the film. This is the first time Bucky and Steve are fighting on the same team again since the war. Bucky is following Steve\u2019s lead, even though he doesn\u2019t know the people he\u2019s fighting with/against, and he\u2019s doing it because it\u2019s for the greater good. They have to stop the other winter soldiers; the mission always comes first. </p><p>The biggest difference between the two films - and Bucky\u2019s current state of mind - is that in <i>The First Avenger</i>, Bucky was actively <i>avoiding</i> recognizing his trauma after very similar events occurred, and in <i>Civil War</i>, not only does Bucky acknowledge what happened to him, we get this very poignant scene that\u2019s both beautiful and devastating:</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"320\" data-orig-width=\"540\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/9a6cf9dd8e6342c866c74f39145610b0/tumblr_pk4jkqdRzi1rfr2d6o4_540.gif\" data-orig-height=\"320\" data-orig-width=\"540\"/></figure><p><i>Source: <a href=\"https://bifelicitys.tumblr.com/post/182734674220/what-you-did-all-those-years-it-wasnt-you-you\" target=\"_blank\">https://bifelicitys.tumblr.com/post/182734674220/what-you-did-all-those-years-it-wasnt-you-you</a><br/></i></p><p>This is a healthy outlook of <i>acceptance</i> and Bucky arrived there with nearly no outside assistance up to this point. This man has been through hell and back in the past 24 hours, on top of a hundred years of tragedy, and instead of breaking down as any reasonable person would, he fights. He has a long way to go in his recovery, but look how far he\u2019s gotten on his own. And this is before Shuri\u2019s help. Bucky\u2019s willpower, tenacity, and depth of character never ceases to amaze me. </p><p>This is especially true with what happens next. You know how I said Bucky has awful luck in avoiding his triggers? Well&hellip;does walking back into the base of your own free volition where you were held prisoner and tortured for decades, count as maybe, oh I dunno, an event that should be avoided at all costs? </p><p>I\u2019m being sarcastic but the depth of this moment shouldn\u2019t be overlooked. Bucky going back to Siberia after everything he\u2019s been through is a huge step backwards for his recovery. Siberia is crawling with triggers, from the threat of the other soldiers, to the cryo chambers, to the chair that wiped his memories and turned him into the Winter Soldier. The amount of bravery it took for Bucky Barnes to walk back into this place can\u2019t be measured. He\u2019s looking his history dead in the eyes with a shaky finger on a trigger and the fact that he doesn\u2019t crack is <i>astounding</i>. </p><p>But then&hellip;this happens.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"210\" data-orig-width=\"540\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/684b9b09a000e612e70e4d42c12b1cf7/tumblr_owa1yfatwc1qetpu1o4_r1_540.gif\" data-orig-height=\"210\" data-orig-width=\"540\"/></figure><p><i>Source: <a href=\"https://tonystark.co/post/165333715841/buckys-facial-expressions-as-tonys-watches-the\" target=\"_blank\">https://tonystark.co/post/165333715841/buckys-facial-expressions-as-tonys-watches-the</a></i><br/></p><p>I can barely stand to watch this because we are seeing Bucky actively having a PTSD episode. As the tape plays, Bucky is dissociating; he\u2019s not there in the room with Steve and Tony, he\u2019s back on the country road where he killed the Starks. The fear and the tears in his eyes, the recognition of what\u2019s playing on the tape, and the knowledge of what\u2019s about to happen are too much. His reaction here shows that he\u2019s barely in control. He immediately responds to Tony lunging at him by raising his gun, an instinctive response, only to lower his weapon seconds later because of the <i>acceptance of what he\u2019s done</i>. This is brutal and heartbreaking and very real.</p><p>It gets worse.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"200\" data-orig-width=\"500\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/c5eb72029cfcb5ed71f2852e559102b2/tumblr_p6y8jaP7fT1ujdp1io4_500.gif\" data-orig-height=\"200\" data-orig-width=\"500\"/></figure><p><i>Source: <a href=\"https://itsawkwardfanboi.tumblr.com/post/176703555531/breaks-my-heart-seeing-him-about-to-pass-out\" target=\"_blank\">https://itsawkwardfanboi.tumblr.com/post/176703555531/breaks-my-heart-seeing-him-about-to-pass-out</a></i></p><p>Bucky snapped in desperation and we witness him lose control in his battle with PTSD. It is very common for fight or flight to kick in under extreme circumstances and pressure; Bucky tried to escape, to avoid this outcome, but he couldn\u2019t. The only thing he had left was to fight. We see Bucky lose control, not as Tony is threatening him, but because Steve is threatened. Bucky was fighting Tony, not to harm him, but to stop him, and not to protect himself, but to protect Steve. It\u2019s an entirely different fighting style than Winter; it\u2019s meant to disarm, not to destroy. Even though Bucky just experienced multiple triggers and traumatic events in a short timeframe, even though he is smack dab right in the middle of a traumatic episode, he still only wants to stop the fight, not kill. This is another example of how the Russos\u2019 comments were unfair and incorrect. Bucky doesn\u2019t go on murderous rampages; he tries to do what\u2019s right. And what happens to him because of it?</p><p>He loses. Every single time. </p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"372\" data-orig-width=\"900\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/47db2234efefecdd8b85f24729c18d09/tumblr_p68zrdgJIE1vv8queo1_1280.gif\" data-orig-height=\"372\" data-orig-width=\"900\"/></figure><p><i>Source: <a href=\"https://marvelworlduniverse.tumblr.com/post/172306346232\" target=\"_blank\">https://marvelworlduniverse.tumblr.com/post/172306346232</a></i><br/></p><p>I will never forgive the writers for making Bucky lose his arm twice. Bucky has a real disability and it has always bothered me that his arm is only ever discussed as a <i>weapon</i>. The trauma from losing his arm the first time was never properly dealt with and here we are again, recycling that awful, painful, horrible plot point. There comes a certain point where you\u2019ve hurt the characters enough and it does nothing for their character development. The grief, pain, and acceptance we see in Bucky\u2019s eyes as he\u2019s lying there wrecks me. He didn\u2019t need to experience this. He\u2019s been through enough. I don\u2019t know how he\u2019s still physically alive or not mentally lost without hope of recovery. But he is. He gets back up. And you know what he does next?</p><p>He asks for help.</p><p><b>Asking for Support</b></p><p>An important part of recovery is having a team of people around you to support you when times are tough. It is amazing to me that Bucky got as far as he did in his recovery, finding positive coping strategies and habits <i>on his own</i> while on the run. </p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"240\" data-orig-width=\"540\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/bb16b6c31486d31bd46b87310e83ad26/tumblr_pf0bxhEA4G1sgmc2zo2_540.gif\" data-orig-height=\"240\" data-orig-width=\"540\"/></figure><p><i>Source: <a href=\"https://juliastiles.tumblr.com/post/178049225734/captain-america-civil-war-2016-dir-anthony\" target=\"_blank\">https://juliastiles.tumblr.com/post/178049225734/captain-america-civil-war-2016-dir-anthony</a></i></p><p>The acknowledgement of Bucky\u2019s trauma in this scene was poignant and bittersweet and I\u2019m very glad they included it, although I feel Steve here. It was sad to see Bucky go back into cryo, but it was necessary until the triggers could be safely removed. </p><p>And they <i>were</i>. This is my biggest issue with what the Russos said - they seemed to have either forgotten or refused to acknowledge what happened in <i>Black Panther,</i> when Shuri successfully removed the triggers and healed Bucky\u2019s brain damage (<i>cough</i>, I know which one I\u2019m placing my bets on, <i>cough</i>). We don\u2019t disrespect Shuri like that in this house. </p><figure data-orig-height=\"326\" data-orig-width=\"268\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/48d4253b3cdfaa6f787ef06d5f3739c2/tumblr_inline_p848qjS0xS1rzkvja_400.gif\" data-orig-height=\"326\" data-orig-width=\"268\"/></figure><p><i>Source: <a href=\"https://stuffsebastianstan.tumblr.com/post/173529606945/c-buckybrnwz\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a href=\"http://stevechoosesbucky.tumblr.com/post/173521604559\" target=\"_blank\">http://stevechoosesbucky.tumblr.com/post/173521604559</a></i></p><p>From this point forward, Bucky\u2019s brain is no longer damaged.

Such as&hellip;</p><p><b>Spending Time Outdoors/With Animals</b></p><p>Before the battle in <i>Avengers: Infinity War</i>, we catch up with Bucky doing something seemingly very out of character: farming.

But upon further reflection, I realized how important this activity actually is.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"400\" data-orig-width=\"540\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d5c90cf0f144559cf6347487208d366b/tumblr_phajfnUkWj1uanck7o3_540.gif\" data-orig-height=\"400\" data-orig-width=\"540\"/></figure><p><i>Source: <a href=\"https://steverogersnotebook.tumblr.com/post/179505503935/bucky-in-wakanda-initial-recovery-vs-settled\" target=\"_blank\">https://steverogersnotebook.tumblr.com/post/179505503935/bucky-in-wakanda-initial-recovery-vs-settled</a></i><br/></p><p>It\u2019s been shown that spending time in nature and around animals can have positive soothing effects on people who are recovering from trauma. Have you ever gone on a nice walk after a bad day to calm your mind, or spent a few minutes petting a dog? Do you exercise as a form of stress relief? It\u2019s the same thing. </p><p>But what we\u2019re also seeing here is Bucky taking responsibility for living beings beyond himself. He\u2019s also interacting with children, an innocent and safe way to re-socialize himself. At this point, Bucky is past the stages of recovery where he needs to avoid, acknowledge, or actively cope with his trauma. He\u2019s <i>healing</i>. He\u2019s moving forward and learning how to live again, not just surviving day by day. </p><p><b>What happens next?</b></p><p>Prior to The Snapture, Bucky\u2019s life was in Wakanda.<i> Avengers: Endgame</i> left quite a few stones unturned when it comes to Bucky\u2019s future; we know that he\u2019s in New York, that he won\u2019t carry the shield, and seemingly, he and Sam are friends. He might hang out with Old Steve every now and again, visit his home in Brooklyn, or get a few goats. Maybe he\u2019ll go back to Wakanda. Maybe he\u2019ll be a part of the Avengers. We don\u2019t know what Bucky will do next. </p><p>Regardless as to what happens, Bucky is in a good place. He\u2019s experienced loads of trauma, but the physical and mental effects have been treated. His brain is not damaged and he\u2019s continuing to recover. And when he\u2019s ready, which I believe will be sooner than we think, he\u2019s going to kick utter ass.</p><p>Bucky is still one of the most badass characters to ever be created; he\u2019s efficiently deadly, a skilled fighter, the world\u2019s best assassin. Those skills haven\u2019t disappeared because he\u2019s now in control of himself (and, some of those skills he had <i>before </i>he was the Winter Soldier; they were what made him a prime candidate in the first place. Remember, the Winter Soldier was supposed to be an equal foe to Captain America). </p><p>But he\u2019s also <i>so much more</i>. Bucky has <i>chosen to be morally good</i>. <b>A man who knows he can be the deadliest person in the room but </b><b><i>chooses not to be</i></b><b> is powerful. </b>Is this not a direct callback to Erskine\u2019s conversation with Steve in <i>The First Avenger</i>? Remember, Captain America is not a perfect soldier. He is a good man. </p><p>Bucky Barnes is a good man, no matter what trauma he\u2019s experienced. So is Sam Wilson. </p><p>I absolutely believe it was the right choice for Sam to take up the shield at this moment in time. Let\u2019s just get that out of the way, no Sam hate here. But I have a problem with the idea that Bucky couldn\u2019t take up the shield because \u201che\u2019s damaged\u201d and that\u2019s why it went to Sam instead. The Russos\u2019 statements were insulting to both characters. Sam didn\u2019t get the shield because Bucky wasn\u2019t ready to carry it; Sam got the shield because it was right and he earned it. Sam deserves to be Cap just as much as Bucky deserves to take a damn nap. They don\u2019t need to knock Bucky down in order to lift Sam up. It was a deliberate choice of words and it was wrong.</p><p>On some level, I understand what the writers and directors were trying to say: Bucky simply isn\u2019t ready. And yet, they continue to speak about Bucky as if he\u2019s weak, a villain, and permanently broken; I don\u2019t think they can truly grasp how much of a complex and compelling character he really is. They had years to prepare a wise, thoughtful answer to the question of Bucky\u2019s future and instead, they spouted off some ableist bullshit. They could take this character that embodies so much of what\u2019s good and evil, right and wrong, fearful and hopeful, and use him to speak to hundreds if not thousands of individuals about the importance of never giving up and letting yourself find peace. They do this perfectly with Steve (\u201cI can do this all day\u201d) and Sam (\u201cAre you going to carry it in a big suitcase or little man-purse?\u201d) but why not with Bucky? </p><p>We just don\u2019t know.

Talking with a therapist about my PTSD helped me get light years ahead in terms of recovery. Whatever path you choose, take care of you. </i></p><h2><b>What is PTSD?</b></h2><p>Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a mental health condition that\u2019s triggered by a terrifying event \u2014 either experiencing it or witnessing it. </p><h2><b>Does Bucky Barnes have PTSD?</b></h2><p>By definition, Bucky has experienced or witnessed the following traumatic events:</p><ul><li><b>WWII</b>. Bucky served as an active soldier during WWII, in the trenches and on the battlefields. He was a distinguished sniper and a Sergeant, which means he witnessed and contributed to the war effort to an even further degree. Many soldiers had \u201cbattle fatigue\u201d or \u201cshell shock\u201d during the war; it is not unlikely that Bucky would have experienced this from WWII alone if he had survived and returned home. </li>\n<li><b>Prisoner of War</b>. Bucky was captured and tortured as a prisoner of war, not once, but <i>twice</i>. He was experimented on in his time in Azzano, before he was captured again by Zola/Hydra. </li>\n<li><b>The Fall. </b>Bucky shouldn\u2019t have survived the fall from the train in the Alps. He watched as Steve tried to save him and failed, and he was cognizant as he fell to his presumed death and as he was then captured.</li><li><b>Disability. </b>As established in flashback scenes, Bucky was conscious when he fell from the train and as he was being pulled through the snow by his captors (who he may have assumed were saviors at that point, double ouch). He woke up to his arm being removed and replaced. This kind of permanent change to his body would be difficult enough to work through in a peaceful recovery environment. We know that Bucky didn\u2019t get that luxury.</li><li><b>Hydra/The Winter Soldier decades. </b>The cryochamber. Being strapped to a table and experimented on. <i>The chair. </i>Having no control over your own mind or body. Being forced to murder; being trapped in a continuous war. This torture lasted for <i>70 years</i>.</li><li><b>Civil War. </b>Free from Hydra, Bucky is trying to live the good life, keep his head down, and stay out of trouble. Then boom, he\u2019s blamed for a bombing that kills how many people? And he\u2019s right in the middle of Tony and Steve\u2019s fallout? Oh, and he loses his arm, <i>again</i>? And then he willingly goes back into cryofreeze? Ok. That\u2019s like 16 traumatic events in the space of 24-48 hours, also known as Bucky Barnes and the No Good Very Bad Day.</li><li><b>Battle Against Thanos and The Snapture, Part 1.</b> Just as Bucky gets to the point where he\u2019s living the good live and recovering from the trauma that has been <i>pretty much his entire life</i>, Thanos shows up, and Bucky is off to another battlefield. Then, he dies. Sort of. Again. How many times is this now?</li>\n<li><b>Battle Against Thanos and The Snapture, Part 2. </b>Bucky gets unsnapped and has approximately two seconds of \u201cyay!\u201d before he is <i>again </i>fighting on a battlefield for his life and the lives of those he cares about and oh, for the entire world. </li>\n</ul><p>A common thread here is that all of these traumatic experiences included a near brush with death or a near constant threat to his person. We don\u2019t even <i>really know </i>the extent of the trauma Bucky endured when he was captured by Hydra. Regardless, I just listed eight different traumatic events that Bucky has experienced or witnessed. I think, yes, it\u2019s safe to say that poor Bucky has PTSD, big-time. </p><h2><b>So, is Bucky Barnes damaged?</b></h2><p><b>No.</b> Bucky Barnes is an individual who have survived more than his fair share of traumatic events, and as such, his brain has had to compensate for how he thinks, processes, and responds to stimuli. He does, at one point, suffer from literal brain damage from the chair, but we are shown in\u00a0<i>Black Panther</i> that Shuri has healed the physical damage to his brain. </p><p>If Bucky experienced permanent damage from his trauma, he would be incapable of living his life. Literally. If he suffered from PTSD and did not actively try to take measures to cope with it, he would not be able to function; his brain wouldn\u2019t let him. (In my opinion, he still would not be \u201cdamaged\u201d because people with mental health issues are still people who deserve respect and shouldn\u2019t be talked about like feral animals, but hey, moving past ableist language is apparently too much to ask and I digress). </p><p>Anyways, my point is that Bucky is not only aware of his condition, but actively takes steps to treat it, therefore, he cannot be of a damaged mind. And I\u2019m gonna prove it. </p><h2><b>Bucky Barnes: PTSD Symptoms and Coping Strategies</b></h2><p>Bucky exhibits both positive and negative coping strategies throughout the films as his journey to recovery progresses, sometimes back to back, which is a great, realistic choice, because it shows that recovery is not linear.</p><p><b>Avoidance</b></p><p><i>Avoidance occurs when a person avoids thoughts or feelings about a traumatic event; it can interfere with emotional recovery and healing and is a common reaction to trauma. </i></p><p>The first step in treating any illness is recognizing the need for treatment. In <i>Captain America: The First Avenger</i> we see Bucky actively avoid recognizing his trauma after being rescued from Azzano. He\u2019s putting on a strong face in the name of avoidance (\u201cLet\u2019s hear it for Captain America!\u201d) but he\u2019s also suffering.</p><figure data-orig-height=\"216\" data-orig-width=\"245\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/c58d2f6c3ba2870f2e25ec54fec3da81/tumblr_n4cct525W41sa1dj7o6_250.gif\" data-orig-height=\"216\" data-orig-width=\"245\"></figure><figure data-orig-width=\"245\" data-orig-height=\"216\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/0499d9d93a967d0a7bd21b6f03d86e05/tumblr_n4cct525W41sa1dj7o4_250.gif\" data-orig-width=\"245\" data-orig-height=\"216\"></figure><p><i>Source: <a href=\"https://cogentranting.tumblr.com/post/174225812218/comic-bucky-phdna-bluandorange-edgebug\" target=\"_blank\">https://cogentranting.tumblr.com/post/174225812218/comic-bucky-phdna-bluandorange-edgebug</a></i><br></p><p>There\u2019s an additional scene in this film that, while played for laughs and parallels between Bucky and Steve, has always meant more to me. When the Howlies are all gathered in a bar, drinking, laughing, and having a good time, Bucky is by himself in the back room (avoiding friends) where it\u2019s quiet (avoiding loud disturbances that could rock him) and he can keep an eye on his surroundings (being overly alert). His uniform is disheveled and he\u2019s lost that cocky Sergeant Barnes signature look. When Peggy walks in and completely ignores him, this is Bucky\u2019s reaction:</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"252\" data-orig-width=\"540\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/59323e222f7e6a2278cfcfe090e5bd9f/tumblr_pkxs5ud5CR1wmht7po3_540.gif\" data-orig-height=\"252\" data-orig-width=\"540\"></figure><p><i>Source: <a href=\"https://steviebarnes.tumblr.com/post/181821865007/steve-little-shit-rogers\" target=\"_blank\">https://steviebarnes.tumblr.com/post/181821865007/steve-little-shit-rogers</a></i><br></p><p>I don\u2019t think Bucky was exaggerating here. Everything he\u2019s been through lately <i>is</i> a horrible dream. We don\u2019t talk about this scene enough in terms of how it shows Bucky\u2019s vulnerability; it\u2019s really the first hint we have that Bucky has lost a part of himself during this war. </p><p><b>Engaging in Dangerous Behavior/Overworking</b></p><p>In <i>Captain America: The First Avenger</i>, we witness Bucky deploying a negative coping strategy for the first time: over dedication to his work that suggests he\u2019s overcompensating as a way of avoiding thinking about his trauma. Engaging in reckless or dangerous behavior also is a symptom of PTSD. Bucky continuously experiences new stressful situations, which ultimately will extend his healing time. For example, he willingly goes on a mission to capture Zola, the man who strapped him to a lab table and pumped him full of knock-off super soldier serum. Seeing the doctor again would be enough to trigger Bucky into an episode but he goes anyways because his dedication to the mission is more important to him than his mental stability.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"248\" data-orig-width=\"500\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/9ee5d2f7c728f6ba2e800e7569d37007/tumblr_p3owclz8R51ub5aypo2_500.gif\" data-orig-height=\"248\" data-orig-width=\"500\"></figure><p><i>Source: <a href=\"https://n-barnes.tumblr.com/post/170542194046/bucky-with-the-guns\" target=\"_blank\">https://n-barnes.tumblr.com/post/170542194046/bucky-with-the-guns</a></i></p><p>Now, this is still an active war zone. The necessity of the Howling Commando missions to win the war means that Bucky doesn\u2019t really have time to process what\u2019s happened to him; he\u2019s incapable of coping in a healthy way at this point and charging forward, continuing to work, is the only way he knows how to survive. </p><p>Bucky has a bad habit of not avoiding his triggers when he feels the mission is more important than his mental health. A common theme throughout every film is that Bucky is put into one dangerous situation right after another, usually immediately following a five minute breather.</p><p>In <i>Captain America: The Winter Soldier, </i>we see glimpses of Bucky Winter being pulled in and out of cryofreeze, placed on mission after mission. The one time we begin to see that there\u2019s more to Winter than they\u2019d have us believe is when Bucky\u2019s memories surface for a hot minute in the bank vault. He has about 30 seconds of downtime where he\u2019s aware and then\u2026wipe him. Back on the mission to kill Captain America. Everything about his time as the Winter Soldier was dangerous; it\u2019s not like Hydra really cared about his physical or mental health. All those years of trauma and overworking probably crashed down on Bucky, hard, the moment he was in control of his own mind again and able to rest. And his brain was in physical shambles on top of it. Poor Bucky.</p><figure data-orig-height=\"380\" data-orig-width=\"245\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/ab5f2c5df065e51a1a90dc5c3df8f11c/tumblr_n9qfmnNt781qe8a0fo4_250.gif\" data-orig-height=\"380\" data-orig-width=\"245\"></figure><p><i>Source: <a href=\"https://mishasteaparty.tumblr.com/post/93678343244/prep-him\" target=\"_blank\">https://mishasteaparty.tumblr.com/post/93678343244/prep-him</a></i><br></p><p>Similarly, in <i>Captain America: Civil War</i>, we get this amazing scene:</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"199\" data-orig-width=\"500\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/fbeb1cc06367214fb50e88290f244c18/tumblr_pcp2nxEVDs1vr4zyso1_500.gif\" data-orig-height=\"199\" data-orig-width=\"500\"></figure><p><i>Source: <a href=\"https://mackievanstan.tumblr.com/post/176453875698/let-him-rest\" target=\"_blank\">https://mackievanstan.tumblr.com/post/176453875698/let-him-rest</a></i><br></p><p>And another in <i>Avengers: Infinity War</i>:</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"199\" data-orig-width=\"500\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/0b98479a968eee477eb7828be8afb6bd/tumblr_pcp2nxEVDs1vr4zyso2_500.gif\" data-orig-height=\"199\" data-orig-width=\"500\"></figure><p><i>Source: <a href=\"https://mackievanstan.tumblr.com/post/176453875698/let-him-rest\" target=\"_blank\">https://mackievanstan.tumblr.com/post/176453875698/let-him-rest</a></i><br></p><p>Once again, Bucky keeps getting thrown back into the middle of a fight when he needs to be resting. This is a very, very bad idea. Super bad. Could really fuck with Bucky\u2019s mental health permanently, bad. This is pretty much the definition of overworking to a detrimental degree.</p><p>But what I really love about his reactions in both of these scenes is that he <i>knows</i> exactly how poor of an idea it is. He knows continuing to fight isn\u2019t good for him and he\u2019s <i>exhausted</i>. He goes willingly anyways, but he has this amazing control over himself at this point. Every single fight could have Bucky experiencing an episode and losing himself to the trauma; he doesn\u2019t. (To be fair, I think this is what the Russos were hinting at but they could have worded it so much better). Bucky could have walked away. He could have surrendered in Bucharest, he could have hidden in Wakanda. He fought anyways. </p><p>This shows just how complex Bucky\u2019s PTSD really is and how well he\u2019s coping with it: he\u2019s engaging in dangerous behaviors which could trigger him, but he\u2019s doing so with awareness and self-actualization. He\u2019s got a handle on himself. These coping behaviors directly contradict the Russos\u2019 statement that you \u201cdon\u2019t want to give another weapon to that guy, it could end up being used the wrong way.\u201d With the exception of being literally triggered with the Winter Soldier code words (which are no longer a threat because good job, Shuri), Bucky fights the good fight every single time. He doesn\u2019t go rogue. He doesn\u2019t lose himself.</p><p>Yeah, if that doesn\u2019t make him a hero, I don\u2019t know what further proof I can provide, because he does this in literally every single film. </p><p><b>Active Coping</b></p><p><i>Active coping means accepting the impact of trauma on your life, taking direct action to improve things, and creating habits that help you respond to everyday life in a positive manner. Avoiding triggers - people, places, anniversaries, or other reminders of the traumatic event - can be a healthy coping strategy.</i></p><p>The first time we see Bucky take a step toward positive active coping is in <i>Captain America: The Winter Soldier</i>:</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"209\" data-orig-width=\"500\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/9c0642733691551ab306517b72cd38d1/tumblr_inline_oa0yo8GXRe1r4kfs0_500.gif\" data-orig-height=\"209\" data-orig-width=\"500\"></figure><p><i>Source: <a href=\"https://thatpleasantnightmare.tumblr.com/post/147118407198\" target=\"_blank\">https://thatpleasantnightmare.tumblr.com/post/147118407198</a></i><br></p><p>Bucky just escaped being a prisoner, was injured in a gruesome fight with his best friend, and is now on the run. What\u2019s one of the first things he does? Research. More than that, in this scene, Bucky is clean, in civilian clothing of his choosing, and appears to have treated his injuries from the fight on the carriers. His eyes are clear and although he is in a public (read: dangerous) setting, he\u2019s aware of his surroundings, has a calm grip on reality, and is processing information. This is Bucky taking the first step to actively reclaiming his identity. This is when we see him begin to heal and <i>he\u2019s doing it on his own</i>. He\u2019s on step one of learning to actively cope: <i>accepting the impact of the trauma on your life. </i></p><p>Bucky continues to exhibit positive coping strategies on his own as time moves forward, as we see in <i>Captain America: Civil War</i>. By the time we meet up with Bucky in Romania, he\u2019s already taken direct action to improve his situation. When we first see Bucky, he\u2019s at a local market, smiling and engaging in conversation with a vendor while he buys produce. He looks good; is physically fit, is practicing hygiene, and is in clean clothes that protect his identity. </p><figure data-orig-height=\"268\" data-orig-width=\"268\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/119c3720f1eed7392d31f32dae3250df/tumblr_pa3dd5zxSy1s9ny9go1_400.gif\" data-orig-height=\"268\" data-orig-width=\"268\"></figure><figure data-orig-height=\"268\" data-orig-width=\"268\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/217532120caa08379e03a8500e9ee6ea/tumblr_pa3dd5zxSy1s9ny9go4_400.gif\" data-orig-height=\"268\" data-orig-width=\"268\"></figure><p><i>Source: <a href=\"https://buckybgrnes.tumblr.com/post/174829011372\" target=\"_blank\">https://buckybgrnes.tumblr.com/post/174829011372</a></i></p><p>I love this scene and specifically the way Sebastian played it, because we see Bucky exhibit positive and negative coping strategies nearly back to back. As he\u2019s trying for normal, he\u2019s also <b>hyper aware of his surroundings</b>, unwilling to let his guard down. He\u2019s scanning for anything that could trigger him or endanger his health, but he is aware. <b>Staying alert and on guard</b> is a classic symptom of PTSD.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"220\" data-orig-width=\"500\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/26ad939f06cc27f9ca2b65697ee4df5d/tumblr_inline_o7e4luA6GY1qac49s_500.gif\" data-orig-height=\"220\" data-orig-width=\"500\"></figure><p><i>Source: <a href=\"https://kittyseb.tumblr.com/post/144559460240/this-whole-scene-of-bucky-on-the-streets-of\" target=\"_blank\">https://kittyseb.tumblr.com/post/144559460240/this-whole-scene-of-bucky-on-the-streets-of</a></i><br></p><p>However, we have to understand that Bucky\u2019s situation requires this sort of hyper vigilance. He\u2019s a wanted man, both by Hydra and the CIA, and he\u2019s actively being hunted. So although Bucky is displaying a classic symptom of PTSD, what we see here is him deploying a positive strategy for coping. By staying aware to his surroundings, he\u2019s protecting himself. This is opposite to the kind of harmful behavior we should expect from him at this point in his recovery. He\u2019s by himself, without any support, and has to look over his shoulder every block to make sure that he\u2019s safe. Extreme hyper vigilance would show being Bucky afraid to leave his apartment altogether. Again, while he is suffering and displaying symptoms of active post traumatic stress, he\u2019s also actively coping by taking direct action to improve his circumstances and creating habits that improve his daily life.</p><p>Through the entirety of the Romania scene in <i>Captain America: Civil War</i>, we catch glimpses of other healthy habits and positive coping strategies Bucky has developed.</p><p><b>Practicing Mindfulness</b></p><p>One really great blink-and-you-miss-it detail from the film is the existence of Bucky\u2019s journals. As Steve goes through Bucky\u2019s stuff (really, Steve?), you see him pick up a journal from the top of Bucky\u2019s fridge. Inside are notes, memories, and references, categorized and marked by tabs. This is one of my favorite examples of Bucky using another strategy for coping with PTSD: <b>mindfulness</b>. </p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"595\" data-orig-width=\"1054\" style=\"\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/044f5266e086cab2a5cf8462b2dbecf7/tumblr_inline_prgo2chxYj1qzh4ks_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"595\" data-orig-width=\"1054\"></figure><p><i>Source: a shitty screenshot I took from the movie.</i></p><p><i>Mindfulness: a mental state achieved by focusing one\u2019s awareness on the present moment, while calmly acknowledging and accepting one\u2019s feelings, thoughts, and bodily sensations, used as a therapeutic technique. Mindfulness may help people get back in touch with the present moment, as well as reduce the extent with which they feel controlled by unpleasant thoughts and memories.</i></p><p>This is an extremely positive practice for Bucky, because at this point in the films, he\u2019s still suffering from brain damage and memory loss. We see several examples of Bucky shaking his head, blinking, and losing himself to possible memories throughout the films. Journaling, as a way to capture those memories, categorize them, and begin rebuilding a timeline of his life, can help Bucky identify his triggers, work through episodes, and ultimately distinguish between past memories and the present, enabling him to regain control of his mind. </p><p><b>Maintaining a Healthy Lifestyle</b></p><p>When Bucky appears on screen, we see that he\u2019s physically fit and obviously taking care of himself. We can assume that during his time as the Winter Soldier, Hydra kept Bucky in peak physical condition in order to succeed in every mission. Whether that was through training, supplements, drugs, the super soldier serum, etc., we don\u2019t know. We don\u2019t see Bucky continuing this training, but we do see the results of it. He\u2019s capable of fighting, obviously maintaining his strength, and he\u2019s able to run away.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"230\" data-orig-width=\"540\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/6245738d1095eff637cea557e61f89ba/tumblr_ocw9qm6MhD1vujk9vo3_540.gif\" data-orig-height=\"230\" data-orig-width=\"540\"></figure><p><i>Source: <a href=\"https://captaincentenarian.tumblr.com/post/149852437382/bucky-running-majestic-hair-appreciation\" target=\"_blank\">https://captaincentenarian.tumblr.com/post/149852437382/bucky-running-majestic-hair-appreciation</a></i><br></p><p>We also witness Bucky making healthy choices in terms of food. He\u2019s got energy/protein bars in his apartment, snacks readily available, pots and pans which would imply he has been cooking, and even a thermos to keep himself hydrated. He\u2019s doing his best to maintain his physical health, which in and of itself is a very positive coping method. He could be depressed, lost in his own mind, never getting out of bed. But Bucky wants to survive, he wants to be better, and so he takes care of himself. This is a good thing.</p><p>If you haven\u2019t seen it, <a href=\"https://steverogersnotebook.tumblr.com/post/144079797515/buckys-apartment-was-oriented-intentionally-by\" target=\"_blank\">please read this post about Bucky\u2019s apartment</a>, because it hits on so many great points about how Bucky is taking care of himself.</p><p><b>Recognizing and Avoiding Triggers</b></p><p>Now for as many positive steps Bucky has taken to actively cope with having PTSD, he\u2019s got awful luck when it comes to avoiding his triggers. It\u2019s two steps forward, one step back, every time. </p><p>At the beginning of <i>Captain America: Civil War</i>, Bucky is trying his damndest to avoid being caught. But stupid Zemo has other plans.</p><p>Look, it\u2019s hard for me to describe what happens next in the film. The way that Sebastian played these scenes will never <i>not</i> give me chills. We get an up close and personal view of Bucky\u2019s PTSD in ways we\u2019ve only caught glimpses of up until now; I don\u2019t know what Sebastian researched in order to create this performance, but it is so spot on that it\u2019s difficult to watch. I wish he got more credit for his acting and it\u2019s a damn waste that he only had 30 seconds of screen time in subsequent movies. *sigh*</p><p>Anyways\u2026</p><p>We see the acceptance and the fear in Bucky\u2019s eyes as the CIA takes him into custody. He\u2019s maintaining his composure, more than he should be capable of doing at this point, and he\u2019s also letting himself slip into a safe zone (\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about it.\u201d). Until Zemo begins reading the trigger words. </p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"235\" data-orig-width=\"540\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/a06a93cc16ee3c578c5498dbf3d30c4e/tumblr_pc1kujlI121wzvtqio3_540.gif\" data-orig-height=\"235\" data-orig-width=\"540\"></figure><p><i>Source: <a href=\"https://cvssian.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">https://cvssian.tumblr.com/</a></i></p><p>Good grief, y\u2019all. Look at him struggling. Bucky literally tried to fight his way out of being triggered, but he failed. Every fear he\u2019s had for the past several years is happening. He\u2019s losing control of his mind, of everything he\u2019s worked so hard for up to this point. I don\u2019t want to look too far into this as a commentary on Bucky\u2019s character, because I don\u2019t think the writers meant for it to be the deep - it serves more as a plot point to get us to the war part of <i>Civil War</i> - but if you stop and examine it for just a second, this scene is an absolute outrage. I can\u2019t believe this happened to Bucky\u2019s mind. They turned him into a weapon, again. They stripped him of <i>years</i> of hard work and recovery. </p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"240\" data-orig-width=\"540\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/3d36d14020b2e822be1b642077ac5225/tumblr_pkiff3pLOx1uhh267o4_540.gif\" data-orig-height=\"240\" data-orig-width=\"540\"></figure><p><i>Source: <a href=\"https://brolinjosh.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">https://brolinjosh.tumblr.com/</a><br></i></p><p>Thankfully - <i>thankfully</i> - one quick hit to the head later, and Bucky\u2019s back. Not only is he aware of his surroundings, he\u2019s cognizant enough to try playing dumb to Sam and Steve at first. I like the conversation that takes place between Bucky and Steve here, because Bucky was smart enough to give Steve exactly what he needed to hear to prove that Bucky was no longer a threat. We don\u2019t talk about Bucky\u2019s raw intelligence enough, likely because we\u2019re always talking about his grief, and this scene gives us one of the rare moments in the film where we get to witness Bucky strategizing. He was <i>just </i>triggered, his brain is mush, he just lost control of himself, and then <i>immediately</i> after, he\u2019s back on mission. We\u2019re back to avoidance/no time to process. Bucky tucks being triggered as Winter into his back pocket to be dealt with on another day. </p><p>Remember how I said Bucky keeps getting thrown into fights, one after another? Guess what.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"230\" data-orig-width=\"540\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/bc6e53d9b77140d1d0c9e0524eecc093/tumblr_ocw9qm6MhD1vujk9vo7_540.gif\" data-orig-height=\"230\" data-orig-width=\"540\"></figure><p><i>Source: <a href=\"https://captaincentenarian.tumblr.com/post/149852437382/bucky-running-majestic-hair-appreciation\" target=\"_blank\">https://captaincentenarian.tumblr.com/post/149852437382/bucky-running-majestic-hair-appreciation</a></i><br></p><p>There are a lot of significant, interesting parallels happening between <i>Captain America: The First Avenger</i> and <i>Captain America: Civil War</i>. The plot goes like this: Bucky was captured and actively tortured; Steve rescued him; they have no time to discuss what\u2019s just happened and deal with it; and then Bucky is forced into another fight before he\u2019s ready. </p><p>We can draw a lot of comparisons between the Howlies and Team Cap here and I wish that they had made the effort to explore this more in the film. This is the first time Bucky and Steve are fighting on the same team again since the war. Bucky is following Steve\u2019s lead, even though he doesn\u2019t know the people he\u2019s fighting with/against, and he\u2019s doing it because it\u2019s for the greater good. They have to stop the other winter soldiers; the mission always comes first. </p><p>The biggest difference between the two films - and Bucky\u2019s current state of mind - is that in <i>The First Avenger</i>, Bucky was actively <i>avoiding</i> recognizing his trauma after very similar events occurred, and in <i>Civil War</i>, not only does Bucky acknowledge what happened to him, we get this very poignant scene that\u2019s both beautiful and devastating:</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"320\" data-orig-width=\"540\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/9a6cf9dd8e6342c866c74f39145610b0/tumblr_pk4jkqdRzi1rfr2d6o4_540.gif\" data-orig-height=\"320\" data-orig-width=\"540\"></figure><p><i>Source: <a href=\"https://bifelicitys.tumblr.com/post/182734674220/what-you-did-all-those-years-it-wasnt-you-you\" target=\"_blank\">https://bifelicitys.tumblr.com/post/182734674220/what-you-did-all-those-years-it-wasnt-you-you</a><br></i></p><p>This is a healthy outlook of <i>acceptance</i> and Bucky arrived there with nearly no outside assistance up to this point. This man has been through hell and back in the past 24 hours, on top of a hundred years of tragedy, and instead of breaking down as any reasonable person would, he fights. He has a long way to go in his recovery, but look how far he\u2019s gotten on his own. And this is before Shuri\u2019s help. Bucky\u2019s willpower, tenacity, and depth of character never ceases to amaze me. </p><p>This is especially true with what happens next. You know how I said Bucky has awful luck in avoiding his triggers? Well\u2026does walking back into the base of your own free volition where you were held prisoner and tortured for decades, count as maybe, oh I dunno, an event that should be avoided at all costs? </p><p>I\u2019m being sarcastic but the depth of this moment shouldn\u2019t be overlooked. Bucky going back to Siberia after everything he\u2019s been through is a huge step backwards for his recovery. Siberia is crawling with triggers, from the threat of the other soldiers, to the cryo chambers, to the chair that wiped his memories and turned him into the Winter Soldier. The amount of bravery it took for Bucky Barnes to walk back into this place can\u2019t be measured. He\u2019s looking his history dead in the eyes with a shaky finger on a trigger and the fact that he doesn\u2019t crack is <i>astounding</i>. </p><p>But then\u2026this happens.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"210\" data-orig-width=\"540\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/684b9b09a000e612e70e4d42c12b1cf7/tumblr_owa1yfatwc1qetpu1o4_r1_540.gif\" data-orig-height=\"210\" data-orig-width=\"540\"></figure><p><i>Source: <a href=\"https://tonystark.co/post/165333715841/buckys-facial-expressions-as-tonys-watches-the\" target=\"_blank\">https://tonystark.co/post/165333715841/buckys-facial-expressions-as-tonys-watches-the</a></i><br></p><p>I can barely stand to watch this because we are seeing Bucky actively having a PTSD episode. As the tape plays, Bucky is dissociating; he\u2019s not there in the room with Steve and Tony, he\u2019s back on the country road where he killed the Starks. The fear and the tears in his eyes, the recognition of what\u2019s playing on the tape, and the knowledge of what\u2019s about to happen are too much. His reaction here shows that he\u2019s barely in control. He immediately responds to Tony lunging at him by raising his gun, an instinctive response, only to lower his weapon seconds later because of the <i>acceptance of what he\u2019s done</i>. This is brutal and heartbreaking and very real.</p><p>It gets worse.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"200\" data-orig-width=\"500\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/c5eb72029cfcb5ed71f2852e559102b2/tumblr_p6y8jaP7fT1ujdp1io4_500.gif\" data-orig-height=\"200\" data-orig-width=\"500\"></figure><p><i>Source: <a href=\"https://itsawkwardfanboi.tumblr.com/post/176703555531/breaks-my-heart-seeing-him-about-to-pass-out\" target=\"_blank\">https://itsawkwardfanboi.tumblr.com/post/176703555531/breaks-my-heart-seeing-him-about-to-pass-out</a></i></p><p>Bucky snapped in desperation and we witness him lose control in his battle with PTSD. It is very common for fight or flight to kick in under extreme circumstances and pressure; Bucky tried to escape, to avoid this outcome, but he couldn\u2019t. The only thing he had left was to fight. We see Bucky lose control, not as Tony is threatening him, but because Steve is threatened. Bucky was fighting Tony, not to harm him, but to stop him, and not to protect himself, but to protect Steve. It\u2019s an entirely different fighting style than Winter; it\u2019s meant to disarm, not to destroy. Even though Bucky just experienced multiple triggers and traumatic events in a short timeframe, even though he is smack dab right in the middle of a traumatic episode, he still only wants to stop the fight, not kill. This is another example of how the Russos\u2019 comments were unfair and incorrect. Bucky doesn\u2019t go on murderous rampages; he tries to do what\u2019s right. And what happens to him because of it?</p><p>He loses. Every single time. </p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"372\" data-orig-width=\"900\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/47db2234efefecdd8b85f24729c18d09/tumblr_p68zrdgJIE1vv8queo1_1280.gif\" data-orig-height=\"372\" data-orig-width=\"900\"></figure><p><i>Source: <a href=\"https://marvelworlduniverse.tumblr.com/post/172306346232\" target=\"_blank\">https://marvelworlduniverse.tumblr.com/post/172306346232</a></i><br></p><p>I will never forgive the writers for making Bucky lose his arm twice. Bucky has a real disability and it has always bothered me that his arm is only ever discussed as a <i>weapon</i>. The trauma from losing his arm the first time was never properly dealt with and here we are again, recycling that awful, painful, horrible plot point. There comes a certain point where you\u2019ve hurt the characters enough and it does nothing for their character development. The grief, pain, and acceptance we see in Bucky\u2019s eyes as he\u2019s lying there wrecks me. He didn\u2019t need to experience this. He\u2019s been through enough. I don\u2019t know how he\u2019s still physically alive or not mentally lost without hope of recovery. But he is. He gets back up. And you know what he does next?</p><p>He asks for help.</p><p><b>Asking for Support</b></p><p>An important part of recovery is having a team of people around you to support you when times are tough. It is amazing to me that Bucky got as far as he did in his recovery, finding positive coping strategies and habits <i>on his own</i> while on the run. </p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"240\" data-orig-width=\"540\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/bb16b6c31486d31bd46b87310e83ad26/tumblr_pf0bxhEA4G1sgmc2zo2_540.gif\" data-orig-height=\"240\" data-orig-width=\"540\"></figure><p><i>Source: <a href=\"https://juliastiles.tumblr.com/post/178049225734/captain-america-civil-war-2016-dir-anthony\" target=\"_blank\">https://juliastiles.tumblr.com/post/178049225734/captain-america-civil-war-2016-dir-anthony</a></i></p><p>The acknowledgement of Bucky\u2019s trauma in this scene was poignant and bittersweet and I\u2019m very glad they included it, although I feel Steve here. It was sad to see Bucky go back into cryo, but it was necessary until the triggers could be safely removed. </p><p>And they <i>were</i>. This is my biggest issue with what the Russos said - they seemed to have either forgotten or refused to acknowledge what happened in <i>Black Panther,</i> when Shuri successfully removed the triggers and healed Bucky\u2019s brain damage (<i>cough</i>, I know which one I\u2019m placing my bets on, <i>cough</i>). We don\u2019t disrespect Shuri like that in this house. </p><figure data-orig-height=\"326\" data-orig-width=\"268\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/48d4253b3cdfaa6f787ef06d5f3739c2/tumblr_inline_p848qjS0xS1rzkvja_400.gif\" data-orig-height=\"326\" data-orig-width=\"268\"></figure><p><i>Source: <a href=\"https://stuffsebastianstan.tumblr.com/post/173529606945/c-buckybrnwz\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a href=\"http://stevechoosesbucky.tumblr.com/post/173521604559\" target=\"_blank\">http://stevechoosesbucky.tumblr.com/post/173521604559</a></i></p><p>From this point forward, Bucky\u2019s brain is no longer damaged.

Such as\u2026</p><p><b>Spending Time Outdoors/With Animals</b></p><p>Before the battle in <i>Avengers: Infinity War</i>, we catch up with Bucky doing something seemingly very out of character: farming.

But upon further reflection, I realized how important this activity actually is.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"400\" data-orig-width=\"540\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d5c90cf0f144559cf6347487208d366b/tumblr_phajfnUkWj1uanck7o3_540.gif\" data-orig-height=\"400\" data-orig-width=\"540\"></figure><p><i>Source: <a href=\"https://steverogersnotebook.tumblr.com/post/179505503935/bucky-in-wakanda-initial-recovery-vs-settled\" target=\"_blank\">https://steverogersnotebook.tumblr.com/post/179505503935/bucky-in-wakanda-initial-recovery-vs-settled</a></i><br></p><p>It\u2019s been shown that spending time in nature and around animals can have positive soothing effects on people who are recovering from trauma. Have you ever gone on a nice walk after a bad day to calm your mind, or spent a few minutes petting a dog? Do you exercise as a form of stress relief? It\u2019s the same thing. </p><p>But what we\u2019re also seeing here is Bucky taking responsibility for living beings beyond himself. He\u2019s also interacting with children, an innocent and safe way to re-socialize himself. At this point, Bucky is past the stages of recovery where he needs to avoid, acknowledge, or actively cope with his trauma. He\u2019s <i>healing</i>. He\u2019s moving forward and learning how to live again, not just surviving day by day. </p><p><b>What happens next?</b></p><p>Prior to The Snapture, Bucky\u2019s life was in Wakanda.<i> Avengers: Endgame</i> left quite a few stones unturned when it comes to Bucky\u2019s future; we know that he\u2019s in New York, that he won\u2019t carry the shield, and seemingly, he and Sam are friends. He might hang out with Old Steve every now and again, visit his home in Brooklyn, or get a few goats. Maybe he\u2019ll go back to Wakanda. Maybe he\u2019ll be a part of the Avengers. We don\u2019t know what Bucky will do next. </p><p>Regardless as to what happens, Bucky is in a good place. He\u2019s experienced loads of trauma, but the physical and mental effects have been treated. His brain is not damaged and he\u2019s continuing to recover. And when he\u2019s ready, which I believe will be sooner than we think, he\u2019s going to kick utter ass.</p><p>Bucky is still one of the most badass characters to ever be created; he\u2019s efficiently deadly, a skilled fighter, the world\u2019s best assassin. Those skills haven\u2019t disappeared because he\u2019s now in control of himself (and, some of those skills he had <i>before </i>he was the Winter Soldier; they were what made him a prime candidate in the first place. Remember, the Winter Soldier was supposed to be an equal foe to Captain America). </p><p>But he\u2019s also <i>so much more</i>. Bucky has <i>chosen to be morally good</i>. <b>A man who knows he can be the deadliest person in the room but </b><b><i>chooses not to be</i></b><b> is powerful. </b>Is this not a direct callback to Erskine\u2019s conversation with Steve in <i>The First Avenger</i>? Remember, Captain America is not a perfect soldier. He is a good man. </p><p>Bucky Barnes is a good man, no matter what trauma he\u2019s experienced. So is Sam Wilson. </p><p>I absolutely believe it was the right choice for Sam to take up the shield at this moment in time. Let\u2019s just get that out of the way, no Sam hate here. But I have a problem with the idea that Bucky couldn\u2019t take up the shield because \u201che\u2019s damaged\u201d and that\u2019s why it went to Sam instead. The Russos\u2019 statements were insulting to both characters. Sam didn\u2019t get the shield because Bucky wasn\u2019t ready to carry it; Sam got the shield because it was right and he earned it. Sam deserves to be Cap just as much as Bucky deserves to take a damn nap. They don\u2019t need to knock Bucky down in order to lift Sam up. It was a deliberate choice of words and it was wrong.</p><p>On some level, I understand what the writers and directors were trying to say: Bucky simply isn\u2019t ready. And yet, they continue to speak about Bucky as if he\u2019s weak, a villain, and permanently broken; I don\u2019t think they can truly grasp how much of a complex and compelling character he really is. They had years to prepare a wise, thoughtful answer to the question of Bucky\u2019s future and instead, they spouted off some ableist bullshit. They could take this character that embodies so much of what\u2019s good and evil, right and wrong, fearful and hopeful, and use him to speak to hundreds if not thousands of individuals about the importance of never giving up and letting yourself find peace. They do this perfectly with Steve (\u201cI can do this all day\u201d) and Sam (\u201cAre you going to carry it in a big suitcase or little man-purse?\u201d) but why not with Bucky? </p><p>We just don\u2019t know.

Talking with a therapist about my PTSD helped me get light years ahead in terms of recovery. Whatever path you choose, take care of you. </i></p><h2><b>What is PTSD?</b></h2><p>Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a mental health condition that\u2019s triggered by a terrifying event \u2014 either experiencing it or witnessing it. </p><h2><b>Does Bucky Barnes have PTSD?</b></h2><p>By definition, Bucky has experienced or witnessed the following traumatic events:</p><ul><li><b>WWII</b>. Bucky served as an active soldier during WWII, in the trenches and on the battlefields. He was a distinguished sniper and a Sergeant, which means he witnessed and contributed to the war effort to an even further degree. Many soldiers had \u201cbattle fatigue\u201d or \u201cshell shock\u201d during the war; it is not unlikely that Bucky would have experienced this from WWII alone if he had survived and returned home. </li>\n<li><b>Prisoner of War</b>. Bucky was captured and tortured as a prisoner of war, not once, but <i>twice</i>. He was experimented on in his time in Azzano, before he was captured again by Zola/Hydra. </li>\n<li><b>The Fall. </b>Bucky shouldn\u2019t have survived the fall from the train in the Alps. He watched as Steve tried to save him and failed, and he was cognizant as he fell to his presumed death and as he was then captured.</li><li><b>Disability. </b>As established in flashback scenes, Bucky was conscious when he fell from the train and as he was being pulled through the snow by his captors (who he may have assumed were saviors at that point, double ouch). He woke up to his arm being removed and replaced. This kind of permanent change to his body would be difficult enough to work through in a peaceful recovery environment. We know that Bucky didn\u2019t get that luxury.</li><li><b>Hydra/The Winter Soldier decades. </b>The cryochamber. Being strapped to a table and experimented on. <i>The chair. </i>Having no control over your own mind or body. Being forced to murder; being trapped in a continuous war. This torture lasted for <i>70 years</i>.</li><li><b>Civil War. </b>Free from Hydra, Bucky is trying to live the good life, keep his head down, and stay out of trouble. Then boom, he\u2019s blamed for a bombing that kills how many people? And he\u2019s right in the middle of Tony and Steve\u2019s fallout? Oh, and he loses his arm, <i>again</i>? And then he willingly goes back into cryofreeze? Ok. That\u2019s like 16 traumatic events in the space of 24-48 hours, also known as Bucky Barnes and the No Good Very Bad Day.</li><li><b>Battle Against Thanos and The Snapture, Part 1.</b> Just as Bucky gets to the point where he\u2019s living the good live and recovering from the trauma that has been <i>pretty much his entire life</i>, Thanos shows up, and Bucky is off to another battlefield. Then, he dies. Sort of. Again. How many times is this now?</li>\n<li><b>Battle Against Thanos and The Snapture, Part 2. </b>Bucky gets unsnapped and has approximately two seconds of \u201cyay!\u201d before he is <i>again </i>fighting on a battlefield for his life and the lives of those he cares about and oh, for the entire world. </li>\n</ul><p>A common thread here is that all of these traumatic experiences included a near brush with death or a near constant threat to his person. We don\u2019t even <i>really know </i>the extent of the trauma Bucky endured when he was captured by Hydra. Regardless, I just listed eight different traumatic events that Bucky has experienced or witnessed. I think, yes, it\u2019s safe to say that poor Bucky has PTSD, big-time. </p><h2><b>So, is Bucky Barnes damaged?</b></h2><p><b>No.</b> Bucky Barnes is an individual who have survived more than his fair share of traumatic events, and as such, his brain has had to compensate for how he thinks, processes, and responds to stimuli. He does, at one point, suffer from literal brain damage from the chair, but we are shown in\u00a0<i>Black Panther</i> that Shuri has healed the physical damage to his brain. </p><p>If Bucky experienced permanent damage from his trauma, he would be incapable of living his life. Literally. If he suffered from PTSD and did not actively try to take measures to cope with it, he would not be able to function; his brain wouldn\u2019t let him. (In my opinion, he still would not be \u201cdamaged\u201d because people with mental health issues are still people who deserve respect and shouldn\u2019t be talked about like feral animals, but hey, moving past ableist language is apparently too much to ask and I digress). </p><p>Anyways, my point is that Bucky is not only aware of his condition, but actively takes steps to treat it, therefore, he cannot be of a damaged mind. And I\u2019m gonna prove it. </p><h2><b>Bucky Barnes: PTSD Symptoms and Coping Strategies</b></h2><p>Bucky exhibits both positive and negative coping strategies throughout the films as his journey to recovery progresses, sometimes back to back, which is a great, realistic choice, because it shows that recovery is not linear.</p><p><b>Avoidance</b></p><p><i>Avoidance occurs when a person avoids thoughts or feelings about a traumatic event; it can interfere with emotional recovery and healing and is a common reaction to trauma. </i></p><p>The first step in treating any illness is recognizing the need for treatment. In <i>Captain America: The First Avenger</i> we see Bucky actively avoid recognizing his trauma after being rescued from Azzano. He\u2019s putting on a strong face in the name of avoidance (\u201cLet\u2019s hear it for Captain America!\u201d) but he\u2019s also suffering.</p><figure data-orig-height=\"216\" data-orig-width=\"245\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/c58d2f6c3ba2870f2e25ec54fec3da81/tumblr_n4cct525W41sa1dj7o6_250.gif\" data-orig-height=\"216\" data-orig-width=\"245\"></figure><figure data-orig-width=\"245\" data-orig-height=\"216\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/0499d9d93a967d0a7bd21b6f03d86e05/tumblr_n4cct525W41sa1dj7o4_250.gif\" data-orig-width=\"245\" data-orig-height=\"216\"></figure><p><i>Source: <a href=\"https://cogentranting.tumblr.com/post/174225812218/comic-bucky-phdna-bluandorange-edgebug\" target=\"_blank\">https://cogentranting.tumblr.com/post/174225812218/comic-bucky-phdna-bluandorange-edgebug</a></i><br></p><p>There\u2019s an additional scene in this film that, while played for laughs and parallels between Bucky and Steve, has always meant more to me. When the Howlies are all gathered in a bar, drinking, laughing, and having a good time, Bucky is by himself in the back room (avoiding friends) where it\u2019s quiet (avoiding loud disturbances that could rock him) and he can keep an eye on his surroundings (being overly alert). His uniform is disheveled and he\u2019s lost that cocky Sergeant Barnes signature look. When Peggy walks in and completely ignores him, this is Bucky\u2019s reaction:</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"252\" data-orig-width=\"540\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/59323e222f7e6a2278cfcfe090e5bd9f/tumblr_pkxs5ud5CR1wmht7po3_540.gif\" data-orig-height=\"252\" data-orig-width=\"540\"></figure><p><i>Source: <a href=\"https://steviebarnes.tumblr.com/post/181821865007/steve-little-shit-rogers\" target=\"_blank\">https://steviebarnes.tumblr.com/post/181821865007/steve-little-shit-rogers</a></i><br></p><p>I don\u2019t think Bucky was exaggerating here. Everything he\u2019s been through lately <i>is</i> a horrible dream. We don\u2019t talk about this scene enough in terms of how it shows Bucky\u2019s vulnerability; it\u2019s really the first hint we have that Bucky has lost a part of himself during this war. </p><p><b>Engaging in Dangerous Behavior/Overworking</b></p><p>In <i>Captain America: The First Avenger</i>, we witness Bucky deploying a negative coping strategy for the first time: over dedication to his work that suggests he\u2019s overcompensating as a way of avoiding thinking about his trauma. Engaging in reckless or dangerous behavior also is a symptom of PTSD. Bucky continuously experiences new stressful situations, which ultimately will extend his healing time. For example, he willingly goes on a mission to capture Zola, the man who strapped him to a lab table and pumped him full of knock-off super soldier serum. Seeing the doctor again would be enough to trigger Bucky into an episode but he goes anyways because his dedication to the mission is more important to him than his mental stability.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"248\" data-orig-width=\"500\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/9ee5d2f7c728f6ba2e800e7569d37007/tumblr_p3owclz8R51ub5aypo2_500.gif\" data-orig-height=\"248\" data-orig-width=\"500\"></figure><p><i>Source: <a href=\"https://n-barnes.tumblr.com/post/170542194046/bucky-with-the-guns\" target=\"_blank\">https://n-barnes.tumblr.com/post/170542194046/bucky-with-the-guns</a></i></p><p>Now, this is still an active war zone. The necessity of the Howling Commando missions to win the war means that Bucky doesn\u2019t really have time to process what\u2019s happened to him; he\u2019s incapable of coping in a healthy way at this point and charging forward, continuing to work, is the only way he knows how to survive. </p><p>Bucky has a bad habit of not avoiding his triggers when he feels the mission is more important than his mental health. A common theme throughout every film is that Bucky is put into one dangerous situation right after another, usually immediately following a five minute breather.</p><p>In <i>Captain America: The Winter Soldier, </i>we see glimpses of Bucky Winter being pulled in and out of cryofreeze, placed on mission after mission. The one time we begin to see that there\u2019s more to Winter than they\u2019d have us believe is when Bucky\u2019s memories surface for a hot minute in the bank vault. He has about 30 seconds of downtime where he\u2019s aware and then\u2026wipe him. Back on the mission to kill Captain America. Everything about his time as the Winter Soldier was dangerous; it\u2019s not like Hydra really cared about his physical or mental health. All those years of trauma and overworking probably crashed down on Bucky, hard, the moment he was in control of his own mind again and able to rest. And his brain was in physical shambles on top of it. Poor Bucky.</p><figure data-orig-height=\"380\" data-orig-width=\"245\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/ab5f2c5df065e51a1a90dc5c3df8f11c/tumblr_n9qfmnNt781qe8a0fo4_250.gif\" data-orig-height=\"380\" data-orig-width=\"245\"></figure><p><i>Source: <a href=\"https://mishasteaparty.tumblr.com/post/93678343244/prep-him\" target=\"_blank\">https://mishasteaparty.tumblr.com/post/93678343244/prep-him</a></i><br></p><p>Similarly, in <i>Captain America: Civil War</i>, we get this amazing scene:</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"199\" data-orig-width=\"500\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/fbeb1cc06367214fb50e88290f244c18/tumblr_pcp2nxEVDs1vr4zyso1_500.gif\" data-orig-height=\"199\" data-orig-width=\"500\"></figure><p><i>Source: <a href=\"https://mackievanstan.tumblr.com/post/176453875698/let-him-rest\" target=\"_blank\">https://mackievanstan.tumblr.com/post/176453875698/let-him-rest</a></i><br></p><p>And another in <i>Avengers: Infinity War</i>:</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"199\" data-orig-width=\"500\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/0b98479a968eee477eb7828be8afb6bd/tumblr_pcp2nxEVDs1vr4zyso2_500.gif\" data-orig-height=\"199\" data-orig-width=\"500\"></figure><p><i>Source: <a href=\"https://mackievanstan.tumblr.com/post/176453875698/let-him-rest\" target=\"_blank\">https://mackievanstan.tumblr.com/post/176453875698/let-him-rest</a></i><br></p><p>Once again, Bucky keeps getting thrown back into the middle of a fight when he needs to be resting. This is a very, very bad idea. Super bad. Could really fuck with Bucky\u2019s mental health permanently, bad. This is pretty much the definition of overworking to a detrimental degree.</p><p>But what I really love about his reactions in both of these scenes is that he <i>knows</i> exactly how poor of an idea it is. He knows continuing to fight isn\u2019t good for him and he\u2019s <i>exhausted</i>. He goes willingly anyways, but he has this amazing control over himself at this point. Every single fight could have Bucky experiencing an episode and losing himself to the trauma; he doesn\u2019t. (To be fair, I think this is what the Russos were hinting at but they could have worded it so much better). Bucky could have walked away. He could have surrendered in Bucharest, he could have hidden in Wakanda. He fought anyways. </p><p>This shows just how complex Bucky\u2019s PTSD really is and how well he\u2019s coping with it: he\u2019s engaging in dangerous behaviors which could trigger him, but he\u2019s doing so with awareness and self-actualization. He\u2019s got a handle on himself. These coping behaviors directly contradict the Russos\u2019 statement that you \u201cdon\u2019t want to give another weapon to that guy, it could end up being used the wrong way.\u201d With the exception of being literally triggered with the Winter Soldier code words (which are no longer a threat because good job, Shuri), Bucky fights the good fight every single time. He doesn\u2019t go rogue. He doesn\u2019t lose himself.</p><p>Yeah, if that doesn\u2019t make him a hero, I don\u2019t know what further proof I can provide, because he does this in literally every single film. </p><p><b>Active Coping</b></p><p><i>Active coping means accepting the impact of trauma on your life, taking direct action to improve things, and creating habits that help you respond to everyday life in a positive manner. Avoiding triggers - people, places, anniversaries, or other reminders of the traumatic event - can be a healthy coping strategy.</i></p><p>The first time we see Bucky take a step toward positive active coping is in <i>Captain America: The Winter Soldier</i>:</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"209\" data-orig-width=\"500\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/9c0642733691551ab306517b72cd38d1/tumblr_inline_oa0yo8GXRe1r4kfs0_500.gif\" data-orig-height=\"209\" data-orig-width=\"500\"></figure><p><i>Source: <a href=\"https://thatpleasantnightmare.tumblr.com/post/147118407198\" target=\"_blank\">https://thatpleasantnightmare.tumblr.com/post/147118407198</a></i><br></p><p>Bucky just escaped being a prisoner, was injured in a gruesome fight with his best friend, and is now on the run. What\u2019s one of the first things he does? Research. More than that, in this scene, Bucky is clean, in civilian clothing of his choosing, and appears to have treated his injuries from the fight on the carriers. His eyes are clear and although he is in a public (read: dangerous) setting, he\u2019s aware of his surroundings, has a calm grip on reality, and is processing information. This is Bucky taking the first step to actively reclaiming his identity. This is when we see him begin to heal and <i>he\u2019s doing it on his own</i>. He\u2019s on step one of learning to actively cope: <i>accepting the impact of the trauma on your life. </i></p><p>Bucky continues to exhibit positive coping strategies on his own as time moves forward, as we see in <i>Captain America: Civil War</i>. By the time we meet up with Bucky in Romania, he\u2019s already taken direct action to improve his situation. When we first see Bucky, he\u2019s at a local market, smiling and engaging in conversation with a vendor while he buys produce. He looks good; is physically fit, is practicing hygiene, and is in clean clothes that protect his identity. </p><figure data-orig-height=\"268\" data-orig-width=\"268\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/119c3720f1eed7392d31f32dae3250df/tumblr_pa3dd5zxSy1s9ny9go1_400.gif\" data-orig-height=\"268\" data-orig-width=\"268\"></figure><figure data-orig-height=\"268\" data-orig-width=\"268\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/217532120caa08379e03a8500e9ee6ea/tumblr_pa3dd5zxSy1s9ny9go4_400.gif\" data-orig-height=\"268\" data-orig-width=\"268\"></figure><p><i>Source: <a href=\"https://buckybgrnes.tumblr.com/post/174829011372\" target=\"_blank\">https://buckybgrnes.tumblr.com/post/174829011372</a></i></p><p>I love this scene and specifically the way Sebastian played it, because we see Bucky exhibit positive and negative coping strategies nearly back to back. As he\u2019s trying for normal, he\u2019s also <b>hyper aware of his surroundings</b>, unwilling to let his guard down. He\u2019s scanning for anything that could trigger him or endanger his health, but he is aware. <b>Staying alert and on guard</b> is a classic symptom of PTSD.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"220\" data-orig-width=\"500\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/26ad939f06cc27f9ca2b65697ee4df5d/tumblr_inline_o7e4luA6GY1qac49s_500.gif\" data-orig-height=\"220\" data-orig-width=\"500\"></figure><p><i>Source: <a href=\"https://kittyseb.tumblr.com/post/144559460240/this-whole-scene-of-bucky-on-the-streets-of\" target=\"_blank\">https://kittyseb.tumblr.com/post/144559460240/this-whole-scene-of-bucky-on-the-streets-of</a></i><br></p><p>However, we have to understand that Bucky\u2019s situation requires this sort of hyper vigilance. He\u2019s a wanted man, both by Hydra and the CIA, and he\u2019s actively being hunted. So although Bucky is displaying a classic symptom of PTSD, what we see here is him deploying a positive strategy for coping. By staying aware to his surroundings, he\u2019s protecting himself. This is opposite to the kind of harmful behavior we should expect from him at this point in his recovery. He\u2019s by himself, without any support, and has to look over his shoulder every block to make sure that he\u2019s safe. Extreme hyper vigilance would show being Bucky afraid to leave his apartment altogether. Again, while he is suffering and displaying symptoms of active post traumatic stress, he\u2019s also actively coping by taking direct action to improve his circumstances and creating habits that improve his daily life.</p><p>Through the entirety of the Romania scene in <i>Captain America: Civil War</i>, we catch glimpses of other healthy habits and positive coping strategies Bucky has developed.</p><p><b>Practicing Mindfulness</b></p><p>One really great blink-and-you-miss-it detail from the film is the existence of Bucky\u2019s journals. As Steve goes through Bucky\u2019s stuff (really, Steve?), you see him pick up a journal from the top of Bucky\u2019s fridge. Inside are notes, memories, and references, categorized and marked by tabs. This is one of my favorite examples of Bucky using another strategy for coping with PTSD: <b>mindfulness</b>. </p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"595\" data-orig-width=\"1054\" style=\"\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/044f5266e086cab2a5cf8462b2dbecf7/tumblr_inline_prgo2chxYj1qzh4ks_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"595\" data-orig-width=\"1054\"></figure><p><i>Source: a shitty screenshot I took from the movie.</i></p><p><i>Mindfulness: a mental state achieved by focusing one\u2019s awareness on the present moment, while calmly acknowledging and accepting one\u2019s feelings, thoughts, and bodily sensations, used as a therapeutic technique. Mindfulness may help people get back in touch with the present moment, as well as reduce the extent with which they feel controlled by unpleasant thoughts and memories.</i></p><p>This is an extremely positive practice for Bucky, because at this point in the films, he\u2019s still suffering from brain damage and memory loss. We see several examples of Bucky shaking his head, blinking, and losing himself to possible memories throughout the films. Journaling, as a way to capture those memories, categorize them, and begin rebuilding a timeline of his life, can help Bucky identify his triggers, work through episodes, and ultimately distinguish between past memories and the present, enabling him to regain control of his mind. </p><p><b>Maintaining a Healthy Lifestyle</b></p><p>When Bucky appears on screen, we see that he\u2019s physically fit and obviously taking care of himself. We can assume that during his time as the Winter Soldier, Hydra kept Bucky in peak physical condition in order to succeed in every mission. Whether that was through training, supplements, drugs, the super soldier serum, etc., we don\u2019t know. We don\u2019t see Bucky continuing this training, but we do see the results of it. He\u2019s capable of fighting, obviously maintaining his strength, and he\u2019s able to run away.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"230\" data-orig-width=\"540\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/6245738d1095eff637cea557e61f89ba/tumblr_ocw9qm6MhD1vujk9vo3_540.gif\" data-orig-height=\"230\" data-orig-width=\"540\"></figure><p><i>Source: <a href=\"https://captaincentenarian.tumblr.com/post/149852437382/bucky-running-majestic-hair-appreciation\" target=\"_blank\">https://captaincentenarian.tumblr.com/post/149852437382/bucky-running-majestic-hair-appreciation</a></i><br></p><p>We also witness Bucky making healthy choices in terms of food. He\u2019s got energy/protein bars in his apartment, snacks readily available, pots and pans which would imply he has been cooking, and even a thermos to keep himself hydrated. He\u2019s doing his best to maintain his physical health, which in and of itself is a very positive coping method. He could be depressed, lost in his own mind, never getting out of bed. But Bucky wants to survive, he wants to be better, and so he takes care of himself. This is a good thing.</p><p>If you haven\u2019t seen it, <a href=\"https://steverogersnotebook.tumblr.com/post/144079797515/buckys-apartment-was-oriented-intentionally-by\" target=\"_blank\">please read this post about Bucky\u2019s apartment</a>, because it hits on so many great points about how Bucky is taking care of himself.</p><p><b>Recognizing and Avoiding Triggers</b></p><p>Now for as many positive steps Bucky has taken to actively cope with having PTSD, he\u2019s got awful luck when it comes to avoiding his triggers. It\u2019s two steps forward, one step back, every time. </p><p>At the beginning of <i>Captain America: Civil War</i>, Bucky is trying his damndest to avoid being caught. But stupid Zemo has other plans.</p><p>Look, it\u2019s hard for me to describe what happens next in the film. The way that Sebastian played these scenes will never <i>not</i> give me chills. We get an up close and personal view of Bucky\u2019s PTSD in ways we\u2019ve only caught glimpses of up until now; I don\u2019t know what Sebastian researched in order to create this performance, but it is so spot on that it\u2019s difficult to watch. I wish he got more credit for his acting and it\u2019s a damn waste that he only had 30 seconds of screen time in subsequent movies. *sigh*</p><p>Anyways\u2026</p><p>We see the acceptance and the fear in Bucky\u2019s eyes as the CIA takes him into custody. He\u2019s maintaining his composure, more than he should be capable of doing at this point, and he\u2019s also letting himself slip into a safe zone (\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about it.\u201d). Until Zemo begins reading the trigger words. </p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"235\" data-orig-width=\"540\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/a06a93cc16ee3c578c5498dbf3d30c4e/tumblr_pc1kujlI121wzvtqio3_540.gif\" data-orig-height=\"235\" data-orig-width=\"540\"></figure><p><i>Source: <a href=\"https://cvssian.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">https://cvssian.tumblr.com/</a></i></p><p>Good grief, y\u2019all. Look at him struggling. Bucky literally tried to fight his way out of being triggered, but he failed. Every fear he\u2019s had for the past several years is happening. He\u2019s losing control of his mind, of everything he\u2019s worked so hard for up to this point. I don\u2019t want to look too far into this as a commentary on Bucky\u2019s character, because I don\u2019t think the writers meant for it to be the deep - it serves more as a plot point to get us to the war part of <i>Civil War</i> - but if you stop and examine it for just a second, this scene is an absolute outrage. I can\u2019t believe this happened to Bucky\u2019s mind. They turned him into a weapon, again. They stripped him of <i>years</i> of hard work and recovery. </p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"240\" data-orig-width=\"540\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/3d36d14020b2e822be1b642077ac5225/tumblr_pkiff3pLOx1uhh267o4_540.gif\" data-orig-height=\"240\" data-orig-width=\"540\"></figure><p><i>Source: <a href=\"https://brolinjosh.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">https://brolinjosh.tumblr.com/</a><br></i></p><p>Thankfully - <i>thankfully</i> - one quick hit to the head later, and Bucky\u2019s back. Not only is he aware of his surroundings, he\u2019s cognizant enough to try playing dumb to Sam and Steve at first. I like the conversation that takes place between Bucky and Steve here, because Bucky was smart enough to give Steve exactly what he needed to hear to prove that Bucky was no longer a threat. We don\u2019t talk about Bucky\u2019s raw intelligence enough, likely because we\u2019re always talking about his grief, and this scene gives us one of the rare moments in the film where we get to witness Bucky strategizing. He was <i>just </i>triggered, his brain is mush, he just lost control of himself, and then <i>immediately</i> after, he\u2019s back on mission. We\u2019re back to avoidance/no time to process. Bucky tucks being triggered as Winter into his back pocket to be dealt with on another day. </p><p>Remember how I said Bucky keeps getting thrown into fights, one after another? Guess what.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"230\" data-orig-width=\"540\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/bc6e53d9b77140d1d0c9e0524eecc093/tumblr_ocw9qm6MhD1vujk9vo7_540.gif\" data-orig-height=\"230\" data-orig-width=\"540\"></figure><p><i>Source: <a href=\"https://captaincentenarian.tumblr.com/post/149852437382/bucky-running-majestic-hair-appreciation\" target=\"_blank\">https://captaincentenarian.tumblr.com/post/149852437382/bucky-running-majestic-hair-appreciation</a></i><br></p><p>There are a lot of significant, interesting parallels happening between <i>Captain America: The First Avenger</i> and <i>Captain America: Civil War</i>. The plot goes like this: Bucky was captured and actively tortured; Steve rescued him; they have no time to discuss what\u2019s just happened and deal with it; and then Bucky is forced into another fight before he\u2019s ready. </p><p>We can draw a lot of comparisons between the Howlies and Team Cap here and I wish that they had made the effort to explore this more in the film. This is the first time Bucky and Steve are fighting on the same team again since the war. Bucky is following Steve\u2019s lead, even though he doesn\u2019t know the people he\u2019s fighting with/against, and he\u2019s doing it because it\u2019s for the greater good. They have to stop the other winter soldiers; the mission always comes first. </p><p>The biggest difference between the two films - and Bucky\u2019s current state of mind - is that in <i>The First Avenger</i>, Bucky was actively <i>avoiding</i> recognizing his trauma after very similar events occurred, and in <i>Civil War</i>, not only does Bucky acknowledge what happened to him, we get this very poignant scene that\u2019s both beautiful and devastating:</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"320\" data-orig-width=\"540\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/9a6cf9dd8e6342c866c74f39145610b0/tumblr_pk4jkqdRzi1rfr2d6o4_540.gif\" data-orig-height=\"320\" data-orig-width=\"540\"></figure><p><i>Source: <a href=\"https://bifelicitys.tumblr.com/post/182734674220/what-you-did-all-those-years-it-wasnt-you-you\" target=\"_blank\">https://bifelicitys.tumblr.com/post/182734674220/what-you-did-all-those-years-it-wasnt-you-you</a><br></i></p><p>This is a healthy outlook of <i>acceptance</i> and Bucky arrived there with nearly no outside assistance up to this point. This man has been through hell and back in the past 24 hours, on top of a hundred years of tragedy, and instead of breaking down as any reasonable person would, he fights. He has a long way to go in his recovery, but look how far he\u2019s gotten on his own. And this is before Shuri\u2019s help. Bucky\u2019s willpower, tenacity, and depth of character never ceases to amaze me. </p><p>This is especially true with what happens next. You know how I said Bucky has awful luck in avoiding his triggers? Well\u2026does walking back into the base of your own free volition where you were held prisoner and tortured for decades, count as maybe, oh I dunno, an event that should be avoided at all costs? </p><p>I\u2019m being sarcastic but the depth of this moment shouldn\u2019t be overlooked. Bucky going back to Siberia after everything he\u2019s been through is a huge step backwards for his recovery. Siberia is crawling with triggers, from the threat of the other soldiers, to the cryo chambers, to the chair that wiped his memories and turned him into the Winter Soldier. The amount of bravery it took for Bucky Barnes to walk back into this place can\u2019t be measured. He\u2019s looking his history dead in the eyes with a shaky finger on a trigger and the fact that he doesn\u2019t crack is <i>astounding</i>. </p><p>But then\u2026this happens.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"210\" data-orig-width=\"540\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/684b9b09a000e612e70e4d42c12b1cf7/tumblr_owa1yfatwc1qetpu1o4_r1_540.gif\" data-orig-height=\"210\" data-orig-width=\"540\"></figure><p><i>Source: <a href=\"https://tonystark.co/post/165333715841/buckys-facial-expressions-as-tonys-watches-the\" target=\"_blank\">https://tonystark.co/post/165333715841/buckys-facial-expressions-as-tonys-watches-the</a></i><br></p><p>I can barely stand to watch this because we are seeing Bucky actively having a PTSD episode. As the tape plays, Bucky is dissociating; he\u2019s not there in the room with Steve and Tony, he\u2019s back on the country road where he killed the Starks. The fear and the tears in his eyes, the recognition of what\u2019s playing on the tape, and the knowledge of what\u2019s about to happen are too much. His reaction here shows that he\u2019s barely in control. He immediately responds to Tony lunging at him by raising his gun, an instinctive response, only to lower his weapon seconds later because of the <i>acceptance of what he\u2019s done</i>. This is brutal and heartbreaking and very real.</p><p>It gets worse.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"200\" data-orig-width=\"500\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/c5eb72029cfcb5ed71f2852e559102b2/tumblr_p6y8jaP7fT1ujdp1io4_500.gif\" data-orig-height=\"200\" data-orig-width=\"500\"></figure><p><i>Source: <a href=\"https://itsawkwardfanboi.tumblr.com/post/176703555531/breaks-my-heart-seeing-him-about-to-pass-out\" target=\"_blank\">https://itsawkwardfanboi.tumblr.com/post/176703555531/breaks-my-heart-seeing-him-about-to-pass-out</a></i></p><p>Bucky snapped in desperation and we witness him lose control in his battle with PTSD. It is very common for fight or flight to kick in under extreme circumstances and pressure; Bucky tried to escape, to avoid this outcome, but he couldn\u2019t. The only thing he had left was to fight. We see Bucky lose control, not as Tony is threatening him, but because Steve is threatened. Bucky was fighting Tony, not to harm him, but to stop him, and not to protect himself, but to protect Steve. It\u2019s an entirely different fighting style than Winter; it\u2019s meant to disarm, not to destroy. Even though Bucky just experienced multiple triggers and traumatic events in a short timeframe, even though he is smack dab right in the middle of a traumatic episode, he still only wants to stop the fight, not kill. This is another example of how the Russos\u2019 comments were unfair and incorrect. Bucky doesn\u2019t go on murderous rampages; he tries to do what\u2019s right. And what happens to him because of it?</p><p>He loses. Every single time. </p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"372\" data-orig-width=\"900\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/47db2234efefecdd8b85f24729c18d09/tumblr_p68zrdgJIE1vv8queo1_1280.gif\" data-orig-height=\"372\" data-orig-width=\"900\"></figure><p><i>Source: <a href=\"https://marvelworlduniverse.tumblr.com/post/172306346232\" target=\"_blank\">https://marvelworlduniverse.tumblr.com/post/172306346232</a></i><br></p><p>I will never forgive the writers for making Bucky lose his arm twice. Bucky has a real disability and it has always bothered me that his arm is only ever discussed as a <i>weapon</i>. The trauma from losing his arm the first time was never properly dealt with and here we are again, recycling that awful, painful, horrible plot point. There comes a certain point where you\u2019ve hurt the characters enough and it does nothing for their character development. The grief, pain, and acceptance we see in Bucky\u2019s eyes as he\u2019s lying there wrecks me. He didn\u2019t need to experience this. He\u2019s been through enough. I don\u2019t know how he\u2019s still physically alive or not mentally lost without hope of recovery. But he is. He gets back up. And you know what he does next?</p><p>He asks for help.</p><p><b>Asking for Support</b></p><p>An important part of recovery is having a team of people around you to support you when times are tough. It is amazing to me that Bucky got as far as he did in his recovery, finding positive coping strategies and habits <i>on his own</i> while on the run. </p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"240\" data-orig-width=\"540\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/bb16b6c31486d31bd46b87310e83ad26/tumblr_pf0bxhEA4G1sgmc2zo2_540.gif\" data-orig-height=\"240\" data-orig-width=\"540\"></figure><p><i>Source: <a href=\"https://juliastiles.tumblr.com/post/178049225734/captain-america-civil-war-2016-dir-anthony\" target=\"_blank\">https://juliastiles.tumblr.com/post/178049225734/captain-america-civil-war-2016-dir-anthony</a></i></p><p>The acknowledgement of Bucky\u2019s trauma in this scene was poignant and bittersweet and I\u2019m very glad they included it, although I feel Steve here. It was sad to see Bucky go back into cryo, but it was necessary until the triggers could be safely removed. </p><p>And they <i>were</i>. This is my biggest issue with what the Russos said - they seemed to have either forgotten or refused to acknowledge what happened in <i>Black Panther,</i> when Shuri successfully removed the triggers and healed Bucky\u2019s brain damage (<i>cough</i>, I know which one I\u2019m placing my bets on, <i>cough</i>). We don\u2019t disrespect Shuri like that in this house. </p><figure data-orig-height=\"326\" data-orig-width=\"268\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/48d4253b3cdfaa6f787ef06d5f3739c2/tumblr_inline_p848qjS0xS1rzkvja_400.gif\" data-orig-height=\"326\" data-orig-width=\"268\"></figure><p><i>Source: <a href=\"https://stuffsebastianstan.tumblr.com/post/173529606945/c-buckybrnwz\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a href=\"http://stevechoosesbucky.tumblr.com/post/173521604559\" target=\"_blank\">http://stevechoosesbucky.tumblr.com/post/173521604559</a></i></p><p>From this point forward, Bucky\u2019s brain is no longer damaged.

Such as\u2026</p><p><b>Spending Time Outdoors/With Animals</b></p><p>Before the battle in <i>Avengers: Infinity War</i>, we catch up with Bucky doing something seemingly very out of character: farming. Look, my blog name is Bucky the Farmer, it should tell you all you need to know about how much this tickled me when I first saw it. But upon further reflection, I realized how important this activity actually is.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"400\" data-orig-width=\"540\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d5c90cf0f144559cf6347487208d366b/tumblr_phajfnUkWj1uanck7o3_540.gif\" data-orig-height=\"400\" data-orig-width=\"540\"></figure><p><i>Source: <a href=\"https://steverogersnotebook.tumblr.com/post/179505503935/bucky-in-wakanda-initial-recovery-vs-settled\" target=\"_blank\">https://steverogersnotebook.tumblr.com/post/179505503935/bucky-in-wakanda-initial-recovery-vs-settled</a></i><br></p><p>It\u2019s been shown that spending time in nature and around animals can have positive soothing effects on people who are recovering from trauma. Have you ever gone on a nice walk after a bad day to calm your mind, or spent a few minutes petting a dog? Do you exercise as a form of stress relief? It\u2019s the same thing. </p><p>But what we\u2019re also seeing here is Bucky taking responsibility for living beings beyond himself. He\u2019s also interacting with children, an innocent and safe way to re-socialize himself. At this point, Bucky is past the stages of recovery where he needs to avoid, acknowledge, or actively cope with his trauma. He\u2019s <i>healing</i>. He\u2019s moving forward and learning how to live again, not just surviving day by day. </p><p><b>What happens next?</b></p><p>Prior to The Snapture, Bucky\u2019s life was in Wakanda.<i> Avengers: Endgame</i> left quite a few stones unturned when it comes to Bucky\u2019s future; we know that he\u2019s in New York, that he won\u2019t carry the shield, and seemingly, he and Sam are friends. He might hang out with Old Steve every now and again, visit his home in Brooklyn, or get a few goats. Maybe he\u2019ll go back to Wakanda. Maybe he\u2019ll be a part of the Avengers. We don\u2019t know what Bucky will do next. </p><p>Regardless as to what happens, Bucky is in a good place. He\u2019s experienced loads of trauma, but the physical and mental effects have been treated. His brain is not damaged and he\u2019s continuing to recover. And when he\u2019s ready, which I believe will be sooner than we think, he\u2019s going to kick utter ass.</p><p>Bucky is still one of the most badass characters to ever be created; he\u2019s efficiently deadly, a skilled fighter, the world\u2019s best assassin. Those skills haven\u2019t disappeared because he\u2019s now in control of himself (and, some of those skills he had <i>before </i>he was the Winter Soldier; they were what made him a prime candidate in the first place. Remember, the Winter Soldier was supposed to be an equal foe to Captain America). </p><p>But he\u2019s also <i>so much more</i>. Bucky has <i>chosen to be morally good</i>. <b>A man who knows he can be the deadliest person in the room but </b><b><i>chooses not to be</i></b><b> is powerful. </b>Is this not a direct callback to Erskine\u2019s conversation with Steve in <i>The First Avenger</i>? Remember, Captain America is not a perfect soldier. He is a good man. </p><p>Bucky Barnes is a good man, no matter what trauma he\u2019s experienced. So is Sam Wilson. </p><p>I absolutely believe it was the right choice for Sam to take up the shield at this moment in time. Let\u2019s just get that out of the way, no Sam hate here. But I have a problem with the idea that Bucky couldn\u2019t take up the shield because \u201che\u2019s damaged\u201d and that\u2019s why it went to Sam instead. The Russos\u2019 statements were insulting to both characters. Sam didn\u2019t get the shield because Bucky wasn\u2019t ready to carry it; Sam got the shield because it was right and he earned it. Sam deserves to be Cap just as much as Bucky deserves to take a damn nap. They don\u2019t need to knock Bucky down in order to lift Sam up. It was a deliberate choice of words and it was wrong.</p><p>On some level, I understand what the writers and directors were trying to say: Bucky simply isn\u2019t ready. And yet, they continue to speak about Bucky as if he\u2019s weak, a villain, and permanently broken; I don\u2019t think they can truly grasp how much of a complex and compelling character he really is. They had years to prepare a wise, thoughtful answer to the question of Bucky\u2019s future and instead, they spouted off some ableist bullshit. They could take this character that embodies so much of what\u2019s good and evil, right and wrong, fearful and hopeful, and use him to speak to hundreds if not thousands of individuals about the importance of never giving up and letting yourself find peace. They do this perfectly with Steve (\u201cI can do this all day\u201d) and Sam (\u201cAre you going to carry it in a big suitcase or little man-purse?\u201d) but why not with Bucky? </p><p>We just don\u2019t know.

Talking with a therapist about my PTSD helped me get light years ahead in terms of recovery. Whatever path you choose, take care of you. </i></p><h2><b>What is PTSD?</b></h2><p>Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a mental health condition that&rsquo;s triggered by a terrifying event &mdash; either experiencing it or witnessing it. </p><h2><b>Does Bucky Barnes have PTSD?</b></h2><p>By definition, Bucky has experienced or witnessed the following traumatic events:</p><ul><li><b>WWII</b>. Bucky served as an active soldier during WWII, in the trenches and on the battlefields. He was a distinguished sniper and a Sergeant, which means he witnessed and contributed to the war effort to an even further degree. Many soldiers had &ldquo;battle fatigue&rdquo; or &ldquo;shell shock&rdquo; during the war; it is not unlikely that Bucky would have experienced this from WWII alone if he had survived and returned home. </li>\n<li><b>Prisoner of War</b>. Bucky was captured and tortured as a prisoner of war, not once, but <i>twice</i>. He was experimented on in his time in Azzano, before he was captured again by Zola/Hydra. </li>\n<li><b>The Fall. </b>Bucky shouldn&rsquo;t have survived the fall from the train in the Alps. He watched as Steve tried to save him and failed, and he was cognizant as he fell to his presumed death and as he was then captured.</li><li><b>Disability. </b>As established in flashback scenes, Bucky was conscious when he fell from the train and as he was being pulled through the snow by his captors (who he may have assumed were saviors at that point, double ouch). He woke up to his arm being removed and replaced. This kind of permanent change to his body would be difficult enough to work through in a peaceful recovery environment. We know that Bucky didn&rsquo;t get that luxury.</li><li><b>Hydra/The Winter Soldier decades. </b>The cryochamber. Being strapped to a table and experimented on. <i>The chair. </i>Having no control over your own mind or body. Being forced to murder; being trapped in a continuous war. This torture lasted for <i>70 years</i>.</li><li><b>Civil War. </b>Free from Hydra, Bucky is trying to live the good life, keep his head down, and stay out of trouble. Then boom, he&rsquo;s blamed for a bombing that kills how many people? And he&rsquo;s right in the middle of Tony and Steve&rsquo;s fallout? Oh, and he loses his arm, <i>again</i>? And then he willingly goes back into cryofreeze? Ok. That&rsquo;s like 16 traumatic events in the space of 24-48 hours, also known as Bucky Barnes and the No Good Very Bad Day.</li><li><b>Battle Against Thanos and The Snapture, Part 1.</b> Just as Bucky gets to the point where he&rsquo;s living the good live and recovering from the trauma that has been <i>pretty much his entire life</i>, Thanos shows up, and Bucky is off to another battlefield. Then, he dies. Sort of. Again. How many times is this now?</li>\n<li><b>Battle Against Thanos and The Snapture, Part 2. </b>Bucky gets unsnapped and has approximately two seconds of &ldquo;yay!&rdquo; before he is <i>again </i>fighting on a battlefield for his life and the lives of those he cares about and oh, for the entire world. </li>\n</ul><p>A common thread here is that all of these traumatic experiences included a near brush with death or a near constant threat to his person. We don&rsquo;t even <i>really know </i>the extent of the trauma Bucky endured when he was captured by Hydra. Regardless, I just listed eight different traumatic events that Bucky has experienced or witnessed. I think, yes, it&rsquo;s safe to say that poor Bucky has PTSD, big-time. </p><h2><b>So, is Bucky Barnes damaged?</b></h2><p><b>No.</b> Bucky Barnes is an individual who have survived more than his fair share of traumatic events, and as such, his brain has had to compensate for how he thinks, processes, and responds to stimuli. He does, at one point, suffer from literal brain damage from the chair, but we are shown in&nbsp;<i>Black Panther</i> that Shuri has healed the physical damage to his brain. </p><p>If Bucky experienced permanent damage from his trauma, he would be incapable of living his life. Literally. If he suffered from PTSD and did not actively try to take measures to cope with it, he would not be able to function; his brain wouldn&rsquo;t let him. (In my opinion, he still would not be &ldquo;damaged&rdquo; because people with mental health issues are still people who deserve respect and shouldn&rsquo;t be talked about like feral animals, but hey, moving past ableist language is apparently too much to ask and I digress). </p><p>Anyways, my point is that Bucky is not only aware of his condition, but actively takes steps to treat it, therefore, he cannot be of a damaged mind. And I&rsquo;m gonna prove it. </p><h2><b>Bucky Barnes: PTSD Symptoms and Coping Strategies</b></h2><p>Bucky exhibits both positive and negative coping strategies throughout the films as his journey to recovery progresses, sometimes back to back, which is a great, realistic choice, because it shows that recovery is not linear.</p><p><b>Avoidance</b></p><p><i>Avoidance occurs when a person avoids thoughts or feelings about a traumatic event; it can interfere with emotional recovery and healing and is a common reaction to trauma. </i></p><p>The first step in treating any illness is recognizing the need for treatment. In <i>Captain America: The First Avenger</i> we see Bucky actively avoid recognizing his trauma after being rescued from Azzano. He&rsquo;s putting on a strong face in the name of avoidance (&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s hear it for Captain America!&rdquo;) but he&rsquo;s also suffering.</p><figure><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/c58d2f6c3ba2870f2e25ec54fec3da81/tumblr_n4cct525W41sa1dj7o6_250.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><figure><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/0499d9d93a967d0a7bd21b6f03d86e05/tumblr_n4cct525W41sa1dj7o4_250.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><p><i>Source: <a href=\"https://cogentranting.tumblr.com/post/174225812218/comic-bucky-phdna-bluandorange-edgebug\" target=\"_blank\">https://cogentranting.tumblr.com/post/174225812218/comic-bucky-phdna-bluandorange-edgebug</a></i><br /></p><p>There&rsquo;s an additional scene in this film that, while played for laughs and parallels between Bucky and Steve, has always meant more to me. When the Howlies are all gathered in a bar, drinking, laughing, and having a good time, Bucky is by himself in the back room (avoiding friends) where it&rsquo;s quiet (avoiding loud disturbances that could rock him) and he can keep an eye on his surroundings (being overly alert). His uniform is disheveled and he&rsquo;s lost that cocky Sergeant Barnes signature look. When Peggy walks in and completely ignores him, this is Bucky&rsquo;s reaction:</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/59323e222f7e6a2278cfcfe090e5bd9f/tumblr_pkxs5ud5CR1wmht7po3_540.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><p><i>Source: <a href=\"https://steviebarnes.tumblr.com/post/181821865007/steve-little-shit-rogers\" target=\"_blank\">https://steviebarnes.tumblr.com/post/181821865007/steve-little-shit-rogers</a></i><br /></p><p>I don&rsquo;t think Bucky was exaggerating here. Everything he&rsquo;s been through lately <i>is</i> a horrible dream. We don&rsquo;t talk about this scene enough in terms of how it shows Bucky&rsquo;s vulnerability; it&rsquo;s really the first hint we have that Bucky has lost a part of himself during this war. </p><p><b>Engaging in Dangerous Behavior/Overworking</b></p><p>In <i>Captain America: The First Avenger</i>, we witness Bucky deploying a negative coping strategy for the first time: over dedication to his work that suggests he&rsquo;s overcompensating as a way of avoiding thinking about his trauma. Engaging in reckless or dangerous behavior also is a symptom of PTSD. Bucky continuously experiences new stressful situations, which ultimately will extend his healing time. For example, he willingly goes on a mission to capture Zola, the man who strapped him to a lab table and pumped him full of knock-off super soldier serum. Seeing the doctor again would be enough to trigger Bucky into an episode but he goes anyways because his dedication to the mission is more important to him than his mental stability.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/9ee5d2f7c728f6ba2e800e7569d37007/tumblr_p3owclz8R51ub5aypo2_500.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><p><i>Source: <a href=\"https://n-barnes.tumblr.com/post/170542194046/bucky-with-the-guns\" target=\"_blank\">https://n-barnes.tumblr.com/post/170542194046/bucky-with-the-guns</a></i></p><p>Now, this is still an active war zone. The necessity of the Howling Commando missions to win the war means that Bucky doesn&rsquo;t really have time to process what&rsquo;s happened to him; he&rsquo;s incapable of coping in a healthy way at this point and charging forward, continuing to work, is the only way he knows how to survive. </p><p>Bucky has a bad habit of not avoiding his triggers when he feels the mission is more important than his mental health. A common theme throughout every film is that Bucky is put into one dangerous situation right after another, usually immediately following a five minute breather.</p><p>In <i>Captain America: The Winter Soldier, </i>we see glimpses of Bucky Winter being pulled in and out of cryofreeze, placed on mission after mission. The one time we begin to see that there&rsquo;s more to Winter than they&rsquo;d have us believe is when Bucky&rsquo;s memories surface for a hot minute in the bank vault. He has about 30 seconds of downtime where he&rsquo;s aware and then&hellip;wipe him. Back on the mission to kill Captain America. Everything about his time as the Winter Soldier was dangerous; it&rsquo;s not like Hydra really cared about his physical or mental health. All those years of trauma and overworking probably crashed down on Bucky, hard, the moment he was in control of his own mind again and able to rest. And his brain was in physical shambles on top of it. Poor Bucky.</p><figure><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/ab5f2c5df065e51a1a90dc5c3df8f11c/tumblr_n9qfmnNt781qe8a0fo4_250.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><p><i>Source: <a href=\"https://mishasteaparty.tumblr.com/post/93678343244/prep-him\" target=\"_blank\">https://mishasteaparty.tumblr.com/post/93678343244/prep-him</a></i><br /></p><p>Similarly, in <i>Captain America: Civil War</i>, we get this amazing scene:</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/fbeb1cc06367214fb50e88290f244c18/tumblr_pcp2nxEVDs1vr4zyso1_500.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><p><i>Source: <a href=\"https://mackievanstan.tumblr.com/post/176453875698/let-him-rest\" target=\"_blank\">https://mackievanstan.tumblr.com/post/176453875698/let-him-rest</a></i><br /></p><p>And another in <i>Avengers: Infinity War</i>:</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/0b98479a968eee477eb7828be8afb6bd/tumblr_pcp2nxEVDs1vr4zyso2_500.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><p><i>Source: <a href=\"https://mackievanstan.tumblr.com/post/176453875698/let-him-rest\" target=\"_blank\">https://mackievanstan.tumblr.com/post/176453875698/let-him-rest</a></i><br /></p><p>Once again, Bucky keeps getting thrown back into the middle of a fight when he needs to be resting. This is a very, very bad idea. Super bad. Could really fuck with Bucky&rsquo;s mental health permanently, bad. This is pretty much the definition of overworking to a detrimental degree.</p><p>But what I really love about his reactions in both of these scenes is that he <i>knows</i> exactly how poor of an idea it is. He knows continuing to fight isn&rsquo;t good for him and he&rsquo;s <i>exhausted</i>. He goes willingly anyways, but he has this amazing control over himself at this point. Every single fight could have Bucky experiencing an episode and losing himself to the trauma; he doesn&rsquo;t. (To be fair, I think this is what the Russos were hinting at but they could have worded it so much better). Bucky could have walked away. He could have surrendered in Bucharest, he could have hidden in Wakanda. He fought anyways. </p><p>This shows just how complex Bucky&rsquo;s PTSD really is and how well he&rsquo;s coping with it: he&rsquo;s engaging in dangerous behaviors which could trigger him, but he&rsquo;s doing so with awareness and self-actualization. He&rsquo;s got a handle on himself. These coping behaviors directly contradict the Russos&rsquo; statement that you &ldquo;don&rsquo;t want to give another weapon to that guy, it could end up being used the wrong way.&rdquo; With the exception of being literally triggered with the Winter Soldier code words (which are no longer a threat because good job, Shuri), Bucky fights the good fight every single time. He doesn&rsquo;t go rogue. He doesn&rsquo;t lose himself.</p><p>Yeah, if that doesn&rsquo;t make him a hero, I don&rsquo;t know what further proof I can provide, because he does this in literally every single film. </p><p><b>Active Coping</b></p><p><i>Active coping means accepting the impact of trauma on your life, taking direct action to improve things, and creating habits that help you respond to everyday life in a positive manner. Avoiding triggers - people, places, anniversaries, or other reminders of the traumatic event - can be a healthy coping strategy.</i></p><p>The first time we see Bucky take a step toward positive active coping is in <i>Captain America: The Winter Soldier</i>:</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/9c0642733691551ab306517b72cd38d1/tumblr_inline_oa0yo8GXRe1r4kfs0_500.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><p><i>Source: <a href=\"https://thatpleasantnightmare.tumblr.com/post/147118407198\" target=\"_blank\">https://thatpleasantnightmare.tumblr.com/post/147118407198</a></i><br /></p><p>Bucky just escaped being a prisoner, was injured in a gruesome fight with his best friend, and is now on the run. What&rsquo;s one of the first things he does? Research. More than that, in this scene, Bucky is clean, in civilian clothing of his choosing, and appears to have treated his injuries from the fight on the carriers. His eyes are clear and although he is in a public (read: dangerous) setting, he&rsquo;s aware of his surroundings, has a calm grip on reality, and is processing information. This is Bucky taking the first step to actively reclaiming his identity. This is when we see him begin to heal and <i>he&rsquo;s doing it on his own</i>. He&rsquo;s on step one of learning to actively cope: <i>accepting the impact of the trauma on your life. </i></p><p>Bucky continues to exhibit positive coping strategies on his own as time moves forward, as we see in <i>Captain America: Civil War</i>. By the time we meet up with Bucky in Romania, he&rsquo;s already taken direct action to improve his situation. When we first see Bucky, he&rsquo;s at a local market, smiling and engaging in conversation with a vendor while he buys produce. He looks good; is physically fit, is practicing hygiene, and is in clean clothes that protect his identity. </p><figure><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/119c3720f1eed7392d31f32dae3250df/tumblr_pa3dd5zxSy1s9ny9go1_400.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><figure><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/217532120caa08379e03a8500e9ee6ea/tumblr_pa3dd5zxSy1s9ny9go4_400.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><p><i>Source: <a href=\"https://buckybgrnes.tumblr.com/post/174829011372\" target=\"_blank\">https://buckybgrnes.tumblr.com/post/174829011372</a></i></p><p>I love this scene and specifically the way Sebastian played it, because we see Bucky exhibit positive and negative coping strategies nearly back to back. As he&rsquo;s trying for normal, he&rsquo;s also <b>hyper aware of his surroundings</b>, unwilling to let his guard down. He&rsquo;s scanning for anything that could trigger him or endanger his health, but he is aware. <b>Staying alert and on guard</b> is a classic symptom of PTSD.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/26ad939f06cc27f9ca2b65697ee4df5d/tumblr_inline_o7e4luA6GY1qac49s_500.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><p><i>Source: <a href=\"https://kittyseb.tumblr.com/post/144559460240/this-whole-scene-of-bucky-on-the-streets-of\" target=\"_blank\">https://kittyseb.tumblr.com/post/144559460240/this-whole-scene-of-bucky-on-the-streets-of</a></i><br /></p><p>However, we have to understand that Bucky&rsquo;s situation requires this sort of hyper vigilance. He&rsquo;s a wanted man, both by Hydra and the CIA, and he&rsquo;s actively being hunted. So although Bucky is displaying a classic symptom of PTSD, what we see here is him deploying a positive strategy for coping. By staying aware to his surroundings, he&rsquo;s protecting himself. This is opposite to the kind of harmful behavior we should expect from him at this point in his recovery. He&rsquo;s by himself, without any support, and has to look over his shoulder every block to make sure that he&rsquo;s safe. Extreme hyper vigilance would show being Bucky afraid to leave his apartment altogether. Again, while he is suffering and displaying symptoms of active post traumatic stress, he&rsquo;s also actively coping by taking direct action to improve his circumstances and creating habits that improve his daily life.</p><p>Through the entirety of the Romania scene in <i>Captain America: Civil War</i>, we catch glimpses of other healthy habits and positive coping strategies Bucky has developed.</p><p><b>Practicing Mindfulness</b></p><p>One really great blink-and-you-miss-it detail from the film is the existence of Bucky&rsquo;s journals. As Steve goes through Bucky&rsquo;s stuff (really, Steve?), you see him pick up a journal from the top of Bucky&rsquo;s fridge. Inside are notes, memories, and references, categorized and marked by tabs. This is one of my favorite examples of Bucky using another strategy for coping with PTSD: <b>mindfulness</b>. </p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/044f5266e086cab2a5cf8462b2dbecf7/tumblr_inline_prgo2chxYj1qzh4ks_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p><i>Source: a shitty screenshot I took from the movie.</i></p><p><i>Mindfulness: a mental state achieved by focusing one&rsquo;s awareness on the present moment, while calmly acknowledging and accepting one&rsquo;s feelings, thoughts, and bodily sensations, used as a therapeutic technique. Mindfulness may help people get back in touch with the present moment, as well as reduce the extent with which they feel controlled by unpleasant thoughts and memories.</i></p><p>This is an extremely positive practice for Bucky, because at this point in the films, he&rsquo;s still suffering from brain damage and memory loss. We see several examples of Bucky shaking his head, blinking, and losing himself to possible memories throughout the films. Journaling, as a way to capture those memories, categorize them, and begin rebuilding a timeline of his life, can help Bucky identify his triggers, work through episodes, and ultimately distinguish between past memories and the present, enabling him to regain control of his mind. </p><p><b>Maintaining a Healthy Lifestyle</b></p><p>When Bucky appears on screen, we see that he&rsquo;s physically fit and obviously taking care of himself. We can assume that during his time as the Winter Soldier, Hydra kept Bucky in peak physical condition in order to succeed in every mission. Whether that was through training, supplements, drugs, the super soldier serum, etc., we don&rsquo;t know. We don&rsquo;t see Bucky continuing this training, but we do see the results of it. He&rsquo;s capable of fighting, obviously maintaining his strength, and he&rsquo;s able to run away.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/6245738d1095eff637cea557e61f89ba/tumblr_ocw9qm6MhD1vujk9vo3_540.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><p><i>Source: <a href=\"https://captaincentenarian.tumblr.com/post/149852437382/bucky-running-majestic-hair-appreciation\" target=\"_blank\">https://captaincentenarian.tumblr.com/post/149852437382/bucky-running-majestic-hair-appreciation</a></i><br /></p><p>We also witness Bucky making healthy choices in terms of food. He&rsquo;s got energy/protein bars in his apartment, snacks readily available, pots and pans which would imply he has been cooking, and even a thermos to keep himself hydrated. He&rsquo;s doing his best to maintain his physical health, which in and of itself is a very positive coping method. He could be depressed, lost in his own mind, never getting out of bed. But Bucky wants to survive, he wants to be better, and so he takes care of himself. This is a good thing.</p><p>If you haven&rsquo;t seen it, <a href=\"https://steverogersnotebook.tumblr.com/post/144079797515/buckys-apartment-was-oriented-intentionally-by\" target=\"_blank\">please read this post about Bucky&rsquo;s apartment</a>, because it hits on so many great points about how Bucky is taking care of himself.</p><p><b>Recognizing and Avoiding Triggers</b></p><p>Now for as many positive steps Bucky has taken to actively cope with having PTSD, he&rsquo;s got awful luck when it comes to avoiding his triggers. It&rsquo;s two steps forward, one step back, every time. </p><p>At the beginning of <i>Captain America: Civil War</i>, Bucky is trying his damndest to avoid being caught. But stupid Zemo has other plans.</p><p>Look, it&rsquo;s hard for me to describe what happens next in the film. The way that Sebastian played these scenes will never <i>not</i> give me chills. We get an up close and personal view of Bucky&rsquo;s PTSD in ways we&rsquo;ve only caught glimpses of up until now; I don&rsquo;t know what Sebastian researched in order to create this performance, but it is so spot on that it&rsquo;s difficult to watch. I wish he got more credit for his acting and it&rsquo;s a damn waste that he only had 30 seconds of screen time in subsequent movies. *sigh*</p><p>Anyways&hellip;</p><p>We see the acceptance and the fear in Bucky&rsquo;s eyes as the CIA takes him into custody. He&rsquo;s maintaining his composure, more than he should be capable of doing at this point, and he&rsquo;s also letting himself slip into a safe zone (&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to talk about it.&rdquo;). Until Zemo begins reading the trigger words. </p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/a06a93cc16ee3c578c5498dbf3d30c4e/tumblr_pc1kujlI121wzvtqio3_540.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><p><i>Source: <a href=\"https://cvssian.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">https://cvssian.tumblr.com/</a></i></p><p>Good grief, y&rsquo;all. Look at him struggling. Bucky literally tried to fight his way out of being triggered, but he failed. Every fear he&rsquo;s had for the past several years is happening. He&rsquo;s losing control of his mind, of everything he&rsquo;s worked so hard for up to this point. I don&rsquo;t want to look too far into this as a commentary on Bucky&rsquo;s character, because I don&rsquo;t think the writers meant for it to be the deep - it serves more as a plot point to get us to the war part of <i>Civil War</i> - but if you stop and examine it for just a second, this scene is an absolute outrage. I can&rsquo;t believe this happened to Bucky&rsquo;s mind. They turned him into a weapon, again. They stripped him of <i>years</i> of hard work and recovery. </p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/3d36d14020b2e822be1b642077ac5225/tumblr_pkiff3pLOx1uhh267o4_540.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><p><i>Source: <a href=\"https://brolinjosh.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">https://brolinjosh.tumblr.com/</a><br /></i></p><p>Thankfully - <i>thankfully</i> - one quick hit to the head later, and Bucky&rsquo;s back. Not only is he aware of his surroundings, he&rsquo;s cognizant enough to try playing dumb to Sam and Steve at first. I like the conversation that takes place between Bucky and Steve here, because Bucky was smart enough to give Steve exactly what he needed to hear to prove that Bucky was no longer a threat. We don&rsquo;t talk about Bucky&rsquo;s raw intelligence enough, likely because we&rsquo;re always talking about his grief, and this scene gives us one of the rare moments in the film where we get to witness Bucky strategizing. He was <i>just </i>triggered, his brain is mush, he just lost control of himself, and then <i>immediately</i> after, he&rsquo;s back on mission. We&rsquo;re back to avoidance/no time to process. Bucky tucks being triggered as Winter into his back pocket to be dealt with on another day. </p><p>Remember how I said Bucky keeps getting thrown into fights, one after another? Guess what.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/bc6e53d9b77140d1d0c9e0524eecc093/tumblr_ocw9qm6MhD1vujk9vo7_540.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><p><i>Source: <a href=\"https://captaincentenarian.tumblr.com/post/149852437382/bucky-running-majestic-hair-appreciation\" target=\"_blank\">https://captaincentenarian.tumblr.com/post/149852437382/bucky-running-majestic-hair-appreciation</a></i><br /></p><p>There are a lot of significant, interesting parallels happening between <i>Captain America: The First Avenger</i> and <i>Captain America: Civil War</i>. The plot goes like this: Bucky was captured and actively tortured; Steve rescued him; they have no time to discuss what&rsquo;s just happened and deal with it; and then Bucky is forced into another fight before he&rsquo;s ready. </p><p>We can draw a lot of comparisons between the Howlies and Team Cap here and I wish that they had made the effort to explore this more in the film. This is the first time Bucky and Steve are fighting on the same team again since the war. Bucky is following Steve&rsquo;s lead, even though he doesn&rsquo;t know the people he&rsquo;s fighting with/against, and he&rsquo;s doing it because it&rsquo;s for the greater good. They have to stop the other winter soldiers; the mission always comes first. </p><p>The biggest difference between the two films - and Bucky&rsquo;s current state of mind - is that in <i>The First Avenger</i>, Bucky was actively <i>avoiding</i> recognizing his trauma after very similar events occurred, and in <i>Civil War</i>, not only does Bucky acknowledge what happened to him, we get this very poignant scene that&rsquo;s both beautiful and devastating:</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/9a6cf9dd8e6342c866c74f39145610b0/tumblr_pk4jkqdRzi1rfr2d6o4_540.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><p><i>Source: <a href=\"https://bifelicitys.tumblr.com/post/182734674220/what-you-did-all-those-years-it-wasnt-you-you\" target=\"_blank\">https://bifelicitys.tumblr.com/post/182734674220/what-you-did-all-those-years-it-wasnt-you-you</a><br /></i></p><p>This is a healthy outlook of <i>acceptance</i> and Bucky arrived there with nearly no outside assistance up to this point. This man has been through hell and back in the past 24 hours, on top of a hundred years of tragedy, and instead of breaking down as any reasonable person would, he fights. He has a long way to go in his recovery, but look how far he&rsquo;s gotten on his own. And this is before Shuri&rsquo;s help. Bucky&rsquo;s willpower, tenacity, and depth of character never ceases to amaze me. </p><p>This is especially true with what happens next. You know how I said Bucky has awful luck in avoiding his triggers? Well&hellip;does walking back into the base of your own free volition where you were held prisoner and tortured for decades, count as maybe, oh I dunno, an event that should be avoided at all costs? </p><p>I&rsquo;m being sarcastic but the depth of this moment shouldn&rsquo;t be overlooked. Bucky going back to Siberia after everything he&rsquo;s been through is a huge step backwards for his recovery. Siberia is crawling with triggers, from the threat of the other soldiers, to the cryo chambers, to the chair that wiped his memories and turned him into the Winter Soldier. The amount of bravery it took for Bucky Barnes to walk back into this place can&rsquo;t be measured. He&rsquo;s looking his history dead in the eyes with a shaky finger on a trigger and the fact that he doesn&rsquo;t crack is <i>astounding</i>. </p><p>But then&hellip;this happens.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/684b9b09a000e612e70e4d42c12b1cf7/tumblr_owa1yfatwc1qetpu1o4_r1_540.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><p><i>Source: <a href=\"https://tonystark.co/post/165333715841/buckys-facial-expressions-as-tonys-watches-the\" target=\"_blank\">https://tonystark.co/post/165333715841/buckys-facial-expressions-as-tonys-watches-the</a></i><br /></p><p>I can barely stand to watch this because we are seeing Bucky actively having a PTSD episode. As the tape plays, Bucky is dissociating; he&rsquo;s not there in the room with Steve and Tony, he&rsquo;s back on the country road where he killed the Starks. The fear and the tears in his eyes, the recognition of what&rsquo;s playing on the tape, and the knowledge of what&rsquo;s about to happen are too much. His reaction here shows that he&rsquo;s barely in control. He immediately responds to Tony lunging at him by raising his gun, an instinctive response, only to lower his weapon seconds later because of the <i>acceptance of what he&rsquo;s done</i>. This is brutal and heartbreaking and very real.</p><p>It gets worse.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/c5eb72029cfcb5ed71f2852e559102b2/tumblr_p6y8jaP7fT1ujdp1io4_500.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><p><i>Source: <a href=\"https://itsawkwardfanboi.tumblr.com/post/176703555531/breaks-my-heart-seeing-him-about-to-pass-out\" target=\"_blank\">https://itsawkwardfanboi.tumblr.com/post/176703555531/breaks-my-heart-seeing-him-about-to-pass-out</a></i></p><p>Bucky snapped in desperation and we witness him lose control in his battle with PTSD. It is very common for fight or flight to kick in under extreme circumstances and pressure; Bucky tried to escape, to avoid this outcome, but he couldn&rsquo;t. The only thing he had left was to fight. We see Bucky lose control, not as Tony is threatening him, but because Steve is threatened. Bucky was fighting Tony, not to harm him, but to stop him, and not to protect himself, but to protect Steve. It&rsquo;s an entirely different fighting style than Winter; it&rsquo;s meant to disarm, not to destroy. Even though Bucky just experienced multiple triggers and traumatic events in a short timeframe, even though he is smack dab right in the middle of a traumatic episode, he still only wants to stop the fight, not kill. This is another example of how the Russos&rsquo; comments were unfair and incorrect. Bucky doesn&rsquo;t go on murderous rampages; he tries to do what&rsquo;s right. And what happens to him because of it?</p><p>He loses. Every single time. </p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/47db2234efefecdd8b85f24729c18d09/tumblr_p68zrdgJIE1vv8queo1_1280.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><p><i>Source: <a href=\"https://marvelworlduniverse.tumblr.com/post/172306346232\" target=\"_blank\">https://marvelworlduniverse.tumblr.com/post/172306346232</a></i><br /></p><p>I will never forgive the writers for making Bucky lose his arm twice. Bucky has a real disability and it has always bothered me that his arm is only ever discussed as a <i>weapon</i>. The trauma from losing his arm the first time was never properly dealt with and here we are again, recycling that awful, painful, horrible plot point. There comes a certain point where you&rsquo;ve hurt the characters enough and it does nothing for their character development. The grief, pain, and acceptance we see in Bucky&rsquo;s eyes as he&rsquo;s lying there wrecks me. He didn&rsquo;t need to experience this. He&rsquo;s been through enough. I don&rsquo;t know how he&rsquo;s still physically alive or not mentally lost without hope of recovery. But he is. He gets back up. And you know what he does next?</p><p>He asks for help.</p><p><b>Asking for Support</b></p><p>An important part of recovery is having a team of people around you to support you when times are tough. It is amazing to me that Bucky got as far as he did in his recovery, finding positive coping strategies and habits <i>on his own</i> while on the run. </p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/bb16b6c31486d31bd46b87310e83ad26/tumblr_pf0bxhEA4G1sgmc2zo2_540.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><p><i>Source: <a href=\"https://juliastiles.tumblr.com/post/178049225734/captain-america-civil-war-2016-dir-anthony\" target=\"_blank\">https://juliastiles.tumblr.com/post/178049225734/captain-america-civil-war-2016-dir-anthony</a></i></p><p>The acknowledgement of Bucky&rsquo;s trauma in this scene was poignant and bittersweet and I&rsquo;m very glad they included it, although I feel Steve here. It was sad to see Bucky go back into cryo, but it was necessary until the triggers could be safely removed. </p><p>And they <i>were</i>. This is my biggest issue with what the Russos said - they seemed to have either forgotten or refused to acknowledge what happened in <i>Black Panther,</i> when Shuri successfully removed the triggers and healed Bucky&rsquo;s brain damage (<i>cough</i>, I know which one I&rsquo;m placing my bets on, <i>cough</i>). We don&rsquo;t disrespect Shuri like that in this house. </p><figure><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/48d4253b3cdfaa6f787ef06d5f3739c2/tumblr_inline_p848qjS0xS1rzkvja_400.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><p><i>Source: <a href=\"https://stuffsebastianstan.tumblr.com/post/173529606945/c-buckybrnwz\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a href=\"http://stevechoosesbucky.tumblr.com/post/173521604559\" target=\"_blank\">http://stevechoosesbucky.tumblr.com/post/173521604559</a></i></p><p>From this point forward, Bucky&rsquo;s brain is no longer damaged. He is no longer experiencing memory loss, nor is he capable of being triggered into Winter Soldier mode. Yes, he still has PTSD. Yes, he will need to continue to work on his recovery, just like Steve, just like Sam. And he <i>does</i>.</p><p>Speaking of Sam, this tidbit from <i>Avengers: Endgame </i>is really satisfying.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/5467b58978b456724b77fcb5f609ac0c/tumblr_pqquz0PDSn1t0zve0_500.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p><i>Source: <a href=\"https://paper-storm.tumblr.com/post/184537376766/can-we-talk-for-a-second-about-how-bucky-was-a\" target=\"_blank\">https://paper-storm.tumblr.com/post/184537376766/can-we-talk-for-a-second-about-how-bucky-was-a</a></i></p><p>This moment is important because it shows that 1) Bucky is still very vulnerable and dealing with a lot of grief; the last time he saw Tony wasn&rsquo;t exactly on the best of terms and now Bucky can never make up for what he did, and 2) Sam is an invaluable person to have at your side and a very, very good friend.</p><p>It&rsquo;s hard to tell where we will go from here in the series/the next round of films, but I have a suggestion for a direction: get Bucky back to his positive coping strategies. Such as&hellip;</p><p><b>Spending Time Outdoors/With Animals</b></p><p>Before the battle in <i>Avengers: Infinity War</i>, we catch up with Bucky doing something seemingly very out of character: farming. Look, my blog name is Bucky the Farmer, it should tell you all you need to know about how much this tickled me when I first saw it. But upon further reflection, I realized how important this activity actually is.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d5c90cf0f144559cf6347487208d366b/tumblr_phajfnUkWj1uanck7o3_540.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><p><i>Source: <a href=\"https://steverogersnotebook.tumblr.com/post/179505503935/bucky-in-wakanda-initial-recovery-vs-settled\" target=\"_blank\">https://steverogersnotebook.tumblr.com/post/179505503935/bucky-in-wakanda-initial-recovery-vs-settled</a></i><br /></p><p>It&rsquo;s been shown that spending time in nature and around animals can have positive soothing effects on people who are recovering from trauma. Have you ever gone on a nice walk after a bad day to calm your mind, or spent a few minutes petting a dog? Do you exercise as a form of stress relief? It&rsquo;s the same thing. </p><p>But what we&rsquo;re also seeing here is Bucky taking responsibility for living beings beyond himself. He&rsquo;s also interacting with children, an innocent and safe way to re-socialize himself. At this point, Bucky is past the stages of recovery where he needs to avoid, acknowledge, or actively cope with his trauma. He&rsquo;s <i>healing</i>. He&rsquo;s moving forward and learning how to live again, not just surviving day by day. </p><p><b>What happens next?</b></p><p>Prior to The Snapture, Bucky&rsquo;s life was in Wakanda.<i> Avengers: Endgame</i> left quite a few stones unturned when it comes to Bucky&rsquo;s future; we know that he&rsquo;s in New York, that he won&rsquo;t carry the shield, and seemingly, he and Sam are friends. He might hang out with Old Steve every now and again, visit his home in Brooklyn, or get a few goats. Maybe he&rsquo;ll go back to Wakanda. Maybe he&rsquo;ll be a part of the Avengers. We don&rsquo;t know what Bucky will do next. </p><p>Regardless as to what happens, Bucky is in a good place. He&rsquo;s experienced loads of trauma, but the physical and mental effects have been treated. His brain is not damaged and he&rsquo;s continuing to recover. And when he&rsquo;s ready, which I believe will be sooner than we think, he&rsquo;s going to kick utter ass.</p><p>Bucky is still one of the most badass characters to ever be created; he&rsquo;s efficiently deadly, a skilled fighter, the world&rsquo;s best assassin. Those skills haven&rsquo;t disappeared because he&rsquo;s now in control of himself (and, some of those skills he had <i>before </i>he was the Winter Soldier; they were what made him a prime candidate in the first place. Remember, the Winter Soldier was supposed to be an equal foe to Captain America). </p><p>But he&rsquo;s also <i>so much more</i>. Bucky has <i>chosen to be morally good</i>. <b>A man who knows he can be the deadliest person in the room but </b><b><i>chooses not to be</i></b><b> is powerful. </b>Is this not a direct callback to Erskine&rsquo;s conversation with Steve in <i>The First Avenger</i>? Remember, Captain America is not a perfect soldier. He is a good man. </p><p>Bucky Barnes is a good man, no matter what trauma he&rsquo;s experienced. So is Sam Wilson. </p><p>I absolutely believe it was the right choice for Sam to take up the shield at this moment in time. Let&rsquo;s just get that out of the way, no Sam hate here. But I have a problem with the idea that Bucky couldn&rsquo;t take up the shield because &ldquo;he&rsquo;s damaged&rdquo; and that&rsquo;s why it went to Sam instead. The Russos&rsquo; statements were insulting to both characters. Sam didn&rsquo;t get the shield because Bucky wasn&rsquo;t ready to carry it; Sam got the shield because it was right and he earned it. Sam deserves to be Cap just as much as Bucky deserves to take a damn nap. They don&rsquo;t need to knock Bucky down in order to lift Sam up. It was a deliberate choice of words and it was wrong.</p><p>On some level, I understand what the writers and directors were trying to say: Bucky simply isn&rsquo;t ready. And yet, they continue to speak about Bucky as if he&rsquo;s weak, a villain, and permanently broken; I don&rsquo;t think they can truly grasp how much of a complex and compelling character he really is. They had years to prepare a wise, thoughtful answer to the question of Bucky&rsquo;s future and instead, they spouted off some ableist bullshit. They could take this character that embodies so much of what&rsquo;s good and evil, right and wrong, fearful and hopeful, and use him to speak to hundreds if not thousands of individuals about the importance of never giving up and letting yourself find peace. They do this perfectly with Steve (&ldquo;I can do this all day&rdquo;) and Sam (&ldquo;Are you going to carry it in a big suitcase or little man-purse?&rdquo;) but why not with Bucky? </p><p>We just don&rsquo;t know. But Bucky Barnes surely deserves better.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/a08d5bd1153f1a88f54ba39eedd39842/tumblr_pqsz96aeOS1rp382io3_540.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><p><i>Source:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://captain-flint.tumblr.com/post/184564356218/bucky-barnes-in-avengers-endgame-looking-like-a\" target=\"_blank\">https://captain-flint.tumblr.com/post/184564356218/bucky-barnes-in-avengers-endgame-looking-like-a</a></i></p><p>Recovering from trauma is an ongoing, nonlinear process.

As lots of fan fiction writers will tell you, Peggy Carter seemingly should have been a young Tony Stark&rsquo;s &lsquo;Aunt Peggy&rsquo;. </h2><p>In both Captain America: the First Avenger and the tv show Agent Carter, Howard Stark and Peggy Carter were close, both as veterans, friends and as founders of Proto-S.H.I.E.L.D, in the 40&rsquo;s and 50&rsquo;s. </p><p>Peggy was also good friends with Edwin Jarvis, who we must assume a young Tony must have been close to, re-J.A.R.V.I.S. And yet there are no mention of Peggy in Tony&rsquo;s films (admittedly for IM1 and 2, the character wasn&rsquo;t created yet, but still) and Tony doesn&rsquo;t go to Peggy&rsquo;s funeral. </p><p>Also after a certain point it appeared as though Howard started surrounding himself with bad people e.g Stane, Vanko, and gaining a reputation as a mortally not great guy, re- &lsquo;never trust a Stark&rsquo; - Hank Pymm.  I had assumed that Howard and Peggy must have had a falling out. And I thought it must have been Howard&rsquo;s fault, that he did something to alienate Peggy. </p><p>And the thing that bothered me was the question of what Howard did? What exactly happened? </p><p>Well folks, it wasn&rsquo;t Howard&rsquo;s fault. </p><p>Steve Rogers happened. </p><p>As you know at the end of Endgame, Steve goes back in time to put the Infinity Stones back and then stays in the past to live his life with Peggy. And we know that, that caused a stable time loop, Steve didn&rsquo;t change anything when he went back in time. </p><p>He didn&rsquo;t stop Hydra at the start, he didn&rsquo;t save Bucky then,he must have stayed out of it all, hence his appearance at Tony&rsquo;s funeral. </p><p>(We can probably assume that this was a, &lsquo;we defeated Thanos that time, let&rsquo;s not change things because we don&rsquo;t know what will happen&rsquo; thing) </p><p>So Steve goes back in time, marries Peggy and tries to change the timeline as little as possible. </p><p>But there&rsquo;s a problem, a Howard Stark shaped problem. </p><p>Howard was a wee bit obsessed with Steve, at first trying to find him and then bringing him up a lot to a young Tony. So Howard knowing Steve was back would have changed things! So Howard didn&rsquo;t alienate Peggy, Peggy distanced herself from Howard! </p><p>And that leaves Howard isolated, allowing people like Stane to manoeuvre themselves into his life and Peggy never becomes part of Tony&rsquo;s life. </p><p>Leading to the stable time loop. </p></p>",
