Sweat trickled down your forehead as you raised your fists once more, crouching down in a fighting position. Steve was training you for your upcoming mission with the team, although you saw no need for a combat session.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not stupid. It\u2019s useful,\u201d Steve objected. He took a swig of water from his steel blue bottle and placed it down gently on the bench. He stepped back onto the mat, eyeing you with a smirk. It was just enough to make your mind race millions of miles per hour.</p><p>\u201cWhy should I be learning to fight if I\u2019m going to be spending my time on the mission hacking computers and using coding?\u201d You whined. </p><p>Although you saw no use for these lessons, you were secretly thrilled that Steve had been the one to offer to teach you. You had barely made it through your last interaction with him, and wanted to show that you weren\u2019t just Tony\u2019s daughter who knew the ins and outs of technology. You wanted to be more than the daughter of Steve\u2019s best friend who your dad said was strictly off limits. Tony hadn\u2019t prohibited your crush on his friend, but he certainly wasn\u2019t approving of it.</p><p>Steve gave you a look. \u201cIn case you run into any trouble, you can use this training when you need it. Start with a stance,\u201d Steve ordered with a straight face, although you could see the ends of his lips twitching, trying to keep from smiling.</p><p>He didn\u2019t think of you as Tony\u2019s daughter. To Steve, you were much more than that. You were the girl who spent hours upon hours in labs, your intelligence and kind manner spiking an interest in Steve\u2019s heart. He couldn\u2019t believe when you argued with Tony about who was right and who was wrong, knowing your intricate, beautiful mind held everything great about you. You weren\u2019t arrogant or too confident, and you had a habit of always making sure everyone was okay, and somehow knowing when another person wasn\u2019t. You joked about having a \u201csixth sense\u201d; being able to detect what was wrong with a person with just a simple look. You were compassionate and hard-working, and always got Steve to smile when he was a little too stressed or serious. Everything about you made Steve wish he could be with you.</p><p>But then there was the fact that you were still Tony\u2019s daughter, although he preferred not to think of you as that.</p><p>\u201cLike this?\u201d You asked, raising your fists and straightening your posture. You leaned your head to the side, a repetitive motion you did when asking a question.</p><p>Steve examined you, although he wasn\u2019t looking at your stance. He saw how you pulled your hair into a ponytail, but strands always seemed to escape and frame your facial features. He saw the soft glow of your eyes in the fading sunlight and the rosiness of your cheeks from a long day of practicing. His heart warmed at the sight of you, tired but persevering like always. </p><p>\u201cSteve?\u201d You called out his name softly, a gentle smile playing on your lips when you noticed he had been staring a tad bit too long. It broke his trance and he cleared his throat, trying to get over the blush that crept onto his cheeks.</p><p>\u201cUm-eh-it\u2019s actually like this.\u201d</p><p>Steve walked over, standing behind you. He wrapped his arms around you and moved your fists to their appropriate place. His body was pressed against yours as he moved your stiff limbs, your breath stopping at the feeling of him against you. You silently hoped he couldn\u2019t feel your heartbeat just then, because it was going insane.</p><p>Steve could, in fact, feel your heartbeat, and bit the inside of his cheek to keep from laughing. He thought that this was just another hopeless crush of his, and was glad to see that part of you felt the same way. </p><p>His eyes were intensely focused on your fists as his face brushed against yours in an attempt to adjust your hands. Your skin tingled at the contact, a mild blush heating up your cheeks as well. </p><p>\u201cSo..am I a super soldier now or-\u201c</p><p>You turned your head towards Steve, not knowing how close the two of you were. His face barely touching yours as your words stuck in your throat, feeling his slow breathing on your skin. His mouth hung open a bit as he gazed deeply into your eyes, unsure how to respond-if he could even respond when his heart started to beat rapidly too. </p><p>The two of you leaned in, closing the small distance-</p><p>The door swung open with a bang as Tony burst in, appalled at the sight.</p><p>\u201cWhen I asked for someone to give Y/N lessons, Cap, they didn\u2019t involve mouth to mouth resuscitation. What on earth do you think you\u2019re doing with my daughter?\u201d Tony shouted, furious. You stepped forward to speak up to your dad, but Steve protectively put an arm out, holding you back.</p><p>\u201cTony, let me explain-\u201c</p><p>\u201cSo, you want to explain how close you were to KISSING MY DAUGHTER JUST NOW, STEVE? WHAT ON EARTH-\u201c</p><p>\u201cDad!\u201d You yelled, hoping Tony\u2019s anger would be spared for Steve and given to you instead.</p><p>\u201cY/N\u2026\u201d Your father\u2019s voice trailed off, a mixture of disappointment and fatigue in his tone. \u201cYou\u2019re incredibly smart. I thought when you told me you liked Steve, you would at least not act on it. I expected so much more from you,\u201d Tony admitted.</p><p>\u201cI will speak with you later. I want to talk to Steve.\u201d Tony\u2019s voice hardened. You knew it was best if you left, taking one last apologetic look at Steve before dashing out the door.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you. Going after Y/N? My daughter?\u201d Tony argued. Steve paced, trying to clear his head.</p><p>\u201cTony-\u201c</p><p>\u201cNo. You don\u2019t get to stand here and apologize, and then I forgive you with conditions and everything goes back to normal,\u201d Tony spat, watching Steve\u2019s stressed state. He groaned, slapping a palm to his forehead. \u201cYou really like her, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Steve inhaled deeply, racking his head for an answer. Of course he liked you. He spent every minute trying to convince himself he didn\u2019t, but when it came down to all of the little moments he shared with you, he knew that there was a flame there he hadn\u2019t felt in ages. </p><p>Steve nodded boldly. \u201cYes. You may hate me for saying it, Tony, but I cannot help but like Y/N. I\u2019m going to spare you the details, but, the way she makes me feel, Tony? I\u2019ve never been more myself than when I\u2019m with her. She makes me incredibly happy, and I respect you but I want to be with Y/N, and I\u2019m not looking for your acceptance here. I\u2019ll do what it takes to be with her.\u201d</p><p>Tony rolled his eyes and folded his arms across his chest. He paused for a few seconds, hundreds of thoughts filling his brain. \u201cOkay, you\u2019ve got guts, Cap. You do know what you\u2019ve got coming for you, right?\u201d</p><p>Steve couldn\u2019t hide his enthusiasm. \u201cYeah, you\u2019re going to give me a really hard time for this, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>A few hours later, a quiet knock came from your door. You were hoping it was Tony, coming back to reason with you after blowing off steam. Instead, Wanda opened the door, poking her head in to see if you wanted her presence. All it took was a nod from you to send her rushing over to your bedside, sitting across from you as she took your hand in hers.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. When Tony said he wanted someone to give you training, I was the one that told Steve he should do it and that you had asked for him. This is all my fault,\u201d Wanda\u2019s pained expression said more than enough for you to hug her.</p><p>You shook your head. \u201cIt\u2019s not your fault. You knew how much I liked Steve, and you were just trying to help out.\u201d</p><p>Wanda pulled away, her face turning into excitement. \u201cSo, how was the session?\u201d She asked, leaning in with anxiousness. You grinned widely.</p><p>\u201cWanda, I might be crazy, or stupid, but, I think he likes me back. I could feel it, right before we almost kissed-\u201c</p><p>\u201cYOU ALMOST KISSED?\u201d Wanda echoed in shock. You pressed a finger to your lips, shushing her. </p><p>\u201cYeah, almost, right before we did then my dad walked in-\u201c</p><p>\u201cNo! Get out!\u201d Wanda exclaimed in disbelief. \u201cI can\u2019t believe Tony walked in right before your big moment. What a romance ruiner. No offense,\u201d Wanda said sheepishly, not wanting to upset you. </p><p>You huffed in annoyance. \u201cI know. I can\u2019t believe it either. I know that he\u2019s just trying to be my dad, but I just want to have something great happen to me that isn\u2019t an award or because of what my dad\u2019s done for me. I\u2019m not just Tony Stark\u2019s daughter, and I think Steve saw me as more. And it felt\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood?\u201d Wanda completed your sentence. You nodded sadly. \u201cWell, what\u2019s going to happen now?\u201d</p><p>A harsher knock echoed at your door. The two of you looked at each other knowingly. \u201cWell, I guess we\u2019re about to find out,\u201d you said.</p><p>You followed your dad silently to the training room where Steve was waiting, hands buried in the pockets of his pants. His eyes met yours for a moment, and a small flicker of happiness flowed inside both of you. Tony snapped, breaking the stare.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve talked to Steve, Y/N, and\u2026\u201d</p><p>An uneasy feeling twisted in your stomach. The pause made you sick with worry.</p><p>\u201cI just don\u2019t think it\u2019s best.\u201d Tony sighed.</p><p>Your heart sank. Steve\u2019s brow furrowed in confusion. \u201cTony you said-\u201c</p><p>\u201cAh, let me finish.\u201d Tony put a hand in the air, drawing attention from the both of you.</p><p>\u201cI just don\u2019t think it\u2019s best\u2026for me to come between the two of you.\u201d Tony gave a defeated smile, but a smile nonetheless.</p><p>You laughed a little in disbelief, looking over at Steve. He rushed over to you, picking you up in his arms and spinning you around in joy. Tony gagged, uncomfortable with the sight.</p><p>\u201cYou treat her well, Rogers. I will not hesitate to get into a fight if she ever sheds a tear because of you-\u201c</p><p>\u201cDad,\u201d you pleaded in embarrassment.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not done, Y/N. There will absolutely be rules. Tons. But they\u2019re all to ensure that my daughter is safe, and that Steve isn\u2019t an idiot. Other than that, go ahead and fall in love. The two of you deserve it.\u201d Now Tony was the one who couldn\u2019t hide the happiness in his voice.</p><p>Steve had his arms around your waist, with yours locked around his neck. The two of you smiled with glee, leaning in to seize the moment. Your lips brushed against his-</p><p>\u201cHEY!

Sweat trickled down your forehead as you raised your fists once more, crouching down in a fighting position. Steve was training you for your upcoming mission with the team, although you saw no need for a combat session.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not stupid. It\u2019s useful,\u201d Steve objected. He took a swig of water from his steel blue bottle and placed it down gently on the bench. He stepped back onto the mat, eyeing you with a smirk. It was just enough to make your mind race millions of miles per hour.</p><p>\u201cWhy should I be learning to fight if I\u2019m going to be spending my time on the mission hacking computers and using coding?\u201d You whined. </p><p>Although you saw no use for these lessons, you were secretly thrilled that Steve had been the one to offer to teach you. You had barely made it through your last interaction with him, and wanted to show that you weren\u2019t just Tony\u2019s daughter who knew the ins and outs of technology. You wanted to be more than the daughter of Steve\u2019s best friend who your dad said was strictly off limits. Tony hadn\u2019t prohibited your crush on his friend, but he certainly wasn\u2019t approving of it.</p><p>Steve gave you a look. \u201cIn case you run into any trouble, you can use this training when you need it. Start with a stance,\u201d Steve ordered with a straight face, although you could see the ends of his lips twitching, trying to keep from smiling.</p><p>He didn\u2019t think of you as Tony\u2019s daughter. To Steve, you were much more than that. You were the girl who spent hours upon hours in labs, your intelligence and kind manner spiking an interest in Steve\u2019s heart. He couldn\u2019t believe when you argued with Tony about who was right and who was wrong, knowing your intricate, beautiful mind held everything great about you. You weren\u2019t arrogant or too confident, and you had a habit of always making sure everyone was okay, and somehow knowing when another person wasn\u2019t. You joked about having a \u201csixth sense\u201d; being able to detect what was wrong with a person with just a simple look. You were compassionate and hard-working, and always got Steve to smile when he was a little too stressed or serious. Everything about you made Steve wish he could be with you.</p><p>But then there was the fact that you were still Tony\u2019s daughter, although he preferred not to think of you as that.</p><p>\u201cLike this?\u201d You asked, raising your fists and straightening your posture. You leaned your head to the side, a repetitive motion you did when asking a question.</p><p>Steve examined you, although he wasn\u2019t looking at your stance. He saw how you pulled your hair into a ponytail, but strands always seemed to escape and frame your facial features. He saw the soft glow of your eyes in the fading sunlight and the rosiness of your cheeks from a long day of practicing. His heart warmed at the sight of you, tired but persevering like always. </p><p>\u201cSteve?\u201d You called out his name softly, a gentle smile playing on your lips when you noticed he had been staring a tad bit too long. It broke his trance and he cleared his throat, trying to get over the blush that crept onto his cheeks.</p><p>\u201cUm-eh-it\u2019s actually like this.\u201d</p><p>Steve walked over, standing behind you. He wrapped his arms around you and moved your fists to their appropriate place. His body was pressed against yours as he moved your stiff limbs, your breath stopping at the feeling of him against you. You silently hoped he couldn\u2019t feel your heartbeat just then, because it was going insane.</p><p>Steve could, in fact, feel your heartbeat, and bit the inside of his cheek to keep from laughing. He thought that this was just another hopeless crush of his, and was glad to see that part of you felt the same way. </p><p>His eyes were intensely focused on your fists as his face brushed against yours in an attempt to adjust your hands. Your skin tingled at the contact, a mild blush heating up your cheeks as well. </p><p>\u201cSo..am I a super soldier now or-\u201c</p><p>You turned your head towards Steve, not knowing how close the two of you were. His face barely touching yours as your words stuck in your throat, feeling his slow breathing on your skin. His mouth hung open a bit as he gazed deeply into your eyes, unsure how to respond-if he could even respond when his heart started to beat rapidly too. </p><p>The two of you leaned in, closing the small distance-</p><p>The door swung open with a bang as Tony burst in, appalled at the sight.</p><p>\u201cWhen I asked for someone to give Y/N lessons, Cap, they didn\u2019t involve mouth to mouth resuscitation. What on earth do you think you\u2019re doing with my daughter?\u201d Tony shouted, furious. You stepped forward to speak up to your dad, but Steve protectively put an arm out, holding you back.</p><p>\u201cTony, let me explain-\u201c</p><p>\u201cSo, you want to explain how close you were to KISSING MY DAUGHTER JUST NOW, STEVE? WHAT ON EARTH-\u201c</p><p>\u201cDad!\u201d You yelled, hoping Tony\u2019s anger would be spared for Steve and given to you instead.</p><p>\u201cY/N\u2026\u201d Your father\u2019s voice trailed off, a mixture of disappointment and fatigue in his tone. \u201cYou\u2019re incredibly smart. I thought when you told me you liked Steve, you would at least not act on it. I expected so much more from you,\u201d Tony admitted.</p><p>\u201cI will speak with you later. I want to talk to Steve.\u201d Tony\u2019s voice hardened. You knew it was best if you left, taking one last apologetic look at Steve before dashing out the door.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you. Going after Y/N? My daughter?\u201d Tony argued. Steve paced, trying to clear his head.</p><p>\u201cTony-\u201c</p><p>\u201cNo. You don\u2019t get to stand here and apologize, and then I forgive you with conditions and everything goes back to normal,\u201d Tony spat, watching Steve\u2019s stressed state. He groaned, slapping a palm to his forehead. \u201cYou really like her, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Steve inhaled deeply, racking his head for an answer. Of course he liked you. He spent every minute trying to convince himself he didn\u2019t, but when it came down to all of the little moments he shared with you, he knew that there was a flame there he hadn\u2019t felt in ages. </p><p>Steve nodded boldly. \u201cYes. You may hate me for saying it, Tony, but I cannot help but like Y/N. I\u2019m going to spare you the details, but, the way she makes me feel, Tony? I\u2019ve never been more myself than when I\u2019m with her. She makes me incredibly happy, and I respect you but I want to be with Y/N, and I\u2019m not looking for your acceptance here. I\u2019ll do what it takes to be with her.\u201d</p><p>Tony rolled his eyes and folded his arms across his chest. He paused for a few seconds, hundreds of thoughts filling his brain. \u201cOkay, you\u2019ve got guts, Cap. You do know what you\u2019ve got coming for you, right?\u201d</p><p>Steve couldn\u2019t hide his enthusiasm. \u201cYeah, you\u2019re going to give me a really hard time for this, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>A few hours later, a quiet knock came from your door. You were hoping it was Tony, coming back to reason with you after blowing off steam. Instead, Wanda opened the door, poking her head in to see if you wanted her presence. All it took was a nod from you to send her rushing over to your bedside, sitting across from you as she took your hand in hers.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. When Tony said he wanted someone to give you training, I was the one that told Steve he should do it and that you had asked for him. This is all my fault,\u201d Wanda\u2019s pained expression said more than enough for you to hug her.</p><p>You shook your head. \u201cIt\u2019s not your fault. You knew how much I liked Steve, and you were just trying to help out.\u201d</p><p>Wanda pulled away, her face turning into excitement. \u201cSo, how was the session?\u201d She asked, leaning in with anxiousness. You grinned widely.</p><p>\u201cWanda, I might be crazy, or stupid, but, I think he likes me back. I could feel it, right before we almost kissed-\u201c</p><p>\u201cYOU ALMOST KISSED?\u201d Wanda echoed in shock. You pressed a finger to your lips, shushing her. </p><p>\u201cYeah, almost, right before we did then my dad walked in-\u201c</p><p>\u201cNo! Get out!\u201d Wanda exclaimed in disbelief. \u201cI can\u2019t believe Tony walked in right before your big moment. What a romance ruiner. No offense,\u201d Wanda said sheepishly, not wanting to upset you. </p><p>You huffed in annoyance. \u201cI know. I can\u2019t believe it either. I know that he\u2019s just trying to be my dad, but I just want to have something great happen to me that isn\u2019t an award or because of what my dad\u2019s done for me. I\u2019m not just Tony Stark\u2019s daughter, and I think Steve saw me as more. And it felt\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood?\u201d Wanda completed your sentence. You nodded sadly. \u201cWell, what\u2019s going to happen now?\u201d</p><p>A harsher knock echoed at your door. The two of you looked at each other knowingly. \u201cWell, I guess we\u2019re about to find out,\u201d you said.</p><p>You followed your dad silently to the training room where Steve was waiting, hands buried in the pockets of his pants. His eyes met yours for a moment, and a small flicker of happiness flowed inside both of you. Tony snapped, breaking the stare.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve talked to Steve, Y/N, and\u2026\u201d</p><p>An uneasy feeling twisted in your stomach. The pause made you sick with worry.</p><p>\u201cI just don\u2019t think it\u2019s best.\u201d Tony sighed.</p><p>Your heart sank. Steve\u2019s brow furrowed in confusion. \u201cTony you said-\u201c</p><p>\u201cAh, let me finish.\u201d Tony put a hand in the air, drawing attention from the both of you.</p><p>\u201cI just don\u2019t think it\u2019s best\u2026for me to come between the two of you.\u201d Tony gave a defeated smile, but a smile nonetheless.</p><p>You laughed a little in disbelief, looking over at Steve. He rushed over to you, picking you up in his arms and spinning you around in joy. Tony gagged, uncomfortable with the sight.</p><p>\u201cYou treat her well, Rogers. I will not hesitate to get into a fight if she ever sheds a tear because of you-\u201c</p><p>\u201cDad,\u201d you pleaded in embarrassment.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not done, Y/N. There will absolutely be rules. Tons. But they\u2019re all to ensure that my daughter is safe, and that Steve isn\u2019t an idiot. Other than that, go ahead and fall in love. The two of you deserve it.\u201d Now Tony was the one who couldn\u2019t hide the happiness in his voice.</p><p>Steve had his arms around your waist, with yours locked around his neck. The two of you smiled with glee, leaning in to seize the moment. Your lips brushed against his-</p><p>\u201cHEY! THERE WILL BE NONE OF THAT!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDAD!\u201d</p><h1>The End\u263a\ufe0f</h1></p>",

                "content": "<p><p>I wasn&rsquo;t planning on doing a second part but I&rsquo;ve gotten a few requests for another part so here you goooooo:)</p><h1>Growing Up-Part Two&#10024;</h1><h2>(Steve x Reader)</h2><h2>(Tony!Dad x Reader)</h2><p>warnings: SWEETNESS, GOOD FRIENDS, OVERPROTECTIVE IRON DAD</p><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"0\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><p>&ldquo;This is stupid.&rdquo;</p><p>You dusted off your hands and pushed yourself up from the mat, sighing in annoyance. Sweat trickled down your forehead as you raised your fists once more, crouching down in a fighting position. Steve was training you for your upcoming mission with the team, although you saw no need for a combat session.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not stupid. It&rsquo;s useful,&rdquo; Steve objected. He took a swig of water from his steel blue bottle and placed it down gently on the bench. He stepped back onto the mat, eyeing you with a smirk. It was just enough to make your mind race millions of miles per hour.</p><p>&ldquo;Why should I be learning to fight if I&rsquo;m going to be spending my time on the mission hacking computers and using coding?&rdquo; You whined. </p><p>Although you saw no use for these lessons, you were secretly thrilled that Steve had been the one to offer to teach you. You had barely made it through your last interaction with him, and wanted to show that you weren&rsquo;t just Tony&rsquo;s daughter who knew the ins and outs of technology. You wanted to be more than the daughter of Steve&rsquo;s best friend who your dad said was strictly off limits. Tony hadn&rsquo;t prohibited your crush on his friend, but he certainly wasn&rsquo;t approving of it.</p><p>Steve gave you a look. &ldquo;In case you run into any trouble, you can use this training when you need it. Start with a stance,&rdquo; Steve ordered with a straight face, although you could see the ends of his lips twitching, trying to keep from smiling.</p><p>He didn&rsquo;t think of you as Tony&rsquo;s daughter. To Steve, you were much more than that. You were the girl who spent hours upon hours in labs, your intelligence and kind manner spiking an interest in Steve&rsquo;s heart. He couldn&rsquo;t believe when you argued with Tony about who was right and who was wrong, knowing your intricate, beautiful mind held everything great about you. You weren&rsquo;t arrogant or too confident, and you had a habit of always making sure everyone was okay, and somehow knowing when another person wasn&rsquo;t. You joked about having a &ldquo;sixth sense&rdquo;; being able to detect what was wrong with a person with just a simple look. You were compassionate and hard-working, and always got Steve to smile when he was a little too stressed or serious. Everything about you made Steve wish he could be with you.</p><p>But then there was the fact that you were still Tony&rsquo;s daughter, although he preferred not to think of you as that.</p><p>&ldquo;Like this?&rdquo; You asked, raising your fists and straightening your posture. You leaned your head to the side, a repetitive motion you did when asking a question.</p><p>Steve examined you, although he wasn&rsquo;t looking at your stance. He saw how you pulled your hair into a ponytail, but strands always seemed to escape and frame your facial features. He saw the soft glow of your eyes in the fading sunlight and the rosiness of your cheeks from a long day of practicing. His heart warmed at the sight of you, tired but persevering like always. </p><p>&ldquo;Steve?&rdquo; You called out his name softly, a gentle smile playing on your lips when you noticed he had been staring a tad bit too long. It broke his trance and he cleared his throat, trying to get over the blush that crept onto his cheeks.</p><p>&ldquo;Um-eh-it&rsquo;s actually like this.&rdquo;</p><p>Steve walked over, standing behind you. He wrapped his arms around you and moved your fists to their appropriate place. His body was pressed against yours as he moved your stiff limbs, your breath stopping at the feeling of him against you. You silently hoped he couldn&rsquo;t feel your heartbeat just then, because it was going insane.</p><p>Steve could, in fact, feel your heartbeat, and bit the inside of his cheek to keep from laughing. He thought that this was just another hopeless crush of his, and was glad to see that part of you felt the same way. </p><p>His eyes were intensely focused on your fists as his face brushed against yours in an attempt to adjust your hands. Your skin tingled at the contact, a mild blush heating up your cheeks as well. </p><p>&ldquo;So..am I a super soldier now or-&ldquo;</p><p>You turned your head towards Steve, not knowing how close the two of you were. His face barely touching yours as your words stuck in your throat, feeling his slow breathing on your skin. His mouth hung open a bit as he gazed deeply into your eyes, unsure how to respond-if he could even respond when his heart started to beat rapidly too. </p><p>The two of you leaned in, closing the small distance-</p><p>The door swung open with a bang as Tony burst in, appalled at the sight.</p><p>&ldquo;When I asked for someone to give Y/N lessons, Cap, they didn&rsquo;t involve mouth to mouth resuscitation. What on earth do you think you&rsquo;re doing with my daughter?&rdquo; Tony shouted, furious. You stepped forward to speak up to your dad, but Steve protectively put an arm out, holding you back.</p><p>&ldquo;Tony, let me explain-&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So, you want to explain how close you were to KISSING MY DAUGHTER JUST NOW, STEVE? WHAT ON EARTH-&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Dad!&rdquo; You yelled, hoping Tony&rsquo;s anger would be spared for Steve and given to you instead.</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N&hellip;&rdquo; Your father&rsquo;s voice trailed off, a mixture of disappointment and fatigue in his tone. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re incredibly smart. I thought when you told me you liked Steve, you would at least not act on it. I expected so much more from you,&rdquo; Tony admitted.</p><p>&ldquo;I will speak with you later. I want to talk to Steve.&rdquo; Tony&rsquo;s voice hardened. You knew it was best if you left, taking one last apologetic look at Steve before dashing out the door.</p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe you. Going after Y/N? My daughter?&rdquo; Tony argued. Steve paced, trying to clear his head.</p><p>&ldquo;Tony-&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No. You don&rsquo;t get to stand here and apologize, and then I forgive you with conditions and everything goes back to normal,&rdquo; Tony spat, watching Steve&rsquo;s stressed state. He groaned, slapping a palm to his forehead. &ldquo;You really like her, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p><p>Steve inhaled deeply, racking his head for an answer. Of course he liked you. He spent every minute trying to convince himself he didn&rsquo;t, but when it came down to all of the little moments he shared with you, he knew that there was a flame there he hadn&rsquo;t felt in ages. </p><p>Steve nodded boldly. &ldquo;Yes. You may hate me for saying it, Tony, but I cannot help but like Y/N. I&rsquo;m going to spare you the details, but, the way she makes me feel, Tony? I&rsquo;ve never been more myself than when I&rsquo;m with her. She makes me incredibly happy, and I respect you but I want to be with Y/N, and I&rsquo;m not looking for your acceptance here. I&rsquo;ll do what it takes to be with her.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony rolled his eyes and folded his arms across his chest. He paused for a few seconds, hundreds of thoughts filling his brain. &ldquo;Okay, you&rsquo;ve got guts, Cap. You do know what you&rsquo;ve got coming for you, right?&rdquo;</p><p>Steve couldn&rsquo;t hide his enthusiasm. &ldquo;Yeah, you&rsquo;re going to give me a really hard time for this, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p><p>A few hours later, a quiet knock came from your door. You were hoping it was Tony, coming back to reason with you after blowing off steam. Instead, Wanda opened the door, poking her head in to see if you wanted her presence. All it took was a nod from you to send her rushing over to your bedside, sitting across from you as she took your hand in hers.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry. When Tony said he wanted someone to give you training, I was the one that told Steve he should do it and that you had asked for him. This is all my fault,&rdquo; Wanda&rsquo;s pained expression said more than enough for you to hug her.</p><p>You shook your head. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not your fault. You knew how much I liked Steve, and you were just trying to help out.&rdquo;</p><p>Wanda pulled away, her face turning into excitement. &ldquo;So, how was the session?&rdquo; She asked, leaning in with anxiousness. You grinned widely.</p><p>&ldquo;Wanda, I might be crazy, or stupid, but, I think he likes me back. I could feel it, right before we almost kissed-&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;YOU ALMOST KISSED?&rdquo; Wanda echoed in shock. You pressed a finger to your lips, shushing her. </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, almost, right before we did then my dad walked in-&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No! Get out!&rdquo; Wanda exclaimed in disbelief. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe Tony walked in right before your big moment. What a romance ruiner. No offense,&rdquo; Wanda said sheepishly, not wanting to upset you. </p><p>You huffed in annoyance. &ldquo;I know. I can&rsquo;t believe it either. I know that he&rsquo;s just trying to be my dad, but I just want to have something great happen to me that isn&rsquo;t an award or because of what my dad&rsquo;s done for me. I&rsquo;m not just Tony Stark&rsquo;s daughter, and I think Steve saw me as more. And it felt&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Good?&rdquo; Wanda completed your sentence. You nodded sadly. &ldquo;Well, what&rsquo;s going to happen now?&rdquo;</p><p>A harsher knock echoed at your door. The two of you looked at each other knowingly. &ldquo;Well, I guess we&rsquo;re about to find out,&rdquo; you said.</p><p>You followed your dad silently to the training room where Steve was waiting, hands buried in the pockets of his pants.

With Tony as a mentor, I felt like he was the father figure I never had, I was more control of my powers than ever before, even if I had more to learn.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>I slowly curled my hands into tight fists in front of me, focusing on the huge guns in the soldiers arms. They started to fold in half, my fists shaking as I put all my concentration into breaking the weapons. The soldiers were stunned, throwing their guns to the floor in panic. I used to hate freaking people out with my powers, but now I had turned it around and used it to my advantage. Before they could get away, I threw them into the air, Peter was swinging by, shooting them against the trees, making them stick there. I followed after him, this side of the perimeter now clear.</p><p>\u201cSteve, we\u2019re done here, we\u2019re coming to you.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cAlright, good job. You guys keep the outside safe whilst we head inside. Wanda and Bucky will stay out here too.\u201d He replied.<br/></p><p>We confirmed his orders, the four of us spreading out around the area. It was quiet, the only noise being made was the wind gently rustling the trees. I wasn\u2019t sure whether to be very alert or to relax slightly, get my breath back. But you never knew what the enemy could be planning.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not here.\u201d Steve suddenly said through the coms.<br/></p><p>\u201cWhat? What\u2019s not here?\u201d I asked, confused as to what they were looking for. Weren\u2019t we just destroying the base?<br/></p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s move out, no one is in here.\u201d Tony added.<br/></p><p>\u201cWait, what were we looking for?\u201d Peter also asked. What weren\u2019t we informed of.<br/></p><p>\u201cCome on you two,\u201d Wanda called to us,\u201cyou heard the boss.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cIs no one gonna tell us what we were actually here for?\u201d<br/></p><p>Peter and I got no response from anyone as we made our way back to the jet. We were confused. Why had we been left out of the mix? Did they have other meetings about this mission without us? I thought we were really getting somewhere with the team. As we flew back to the base, Peter and I whispered to each other, debating on what to say to the team. Should we even speak up? Would we risk everything by voicing our opinions?</p><p>\u201cUh, excuse me, everybody.\u201d Peter only just got their attention.<br/></p><p>They all looked at us as we stood up, we glanced at each other, wondering what to say next.\u201cWe just wanted to ask you all something.\u201d</p><p>They waited.</p><p>\u201cWe were wondering why we weren\u2019t told about this thing we were supposed to be searching for?\u201d I nervously spat out.<br/></p><p>The rest of the team shared looks, some confused, some with sympathy, though they all avoided our eye contact. Of course they knew something we didn\u2019t, but if we were going to be a team, shouldn\u2019t we have been briefed on everything? I realised we were new, but could withholding this information just cause a mess? Make something go wrong on the mission?<br/></p><p>\u201cUh, well-\u201d Natasha started, being the only one to man up and say something.<br/></p><p>\u201cHey, anyone hungry? I am.\u201d Tony randomly pointed out.<br/></p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I scoffed. Why wasn\u2019t he taking us seriously?<br/></p><p>\u201cI wanna take you kids for some food. You\u2019ve gotta be hungry right?\u201d<br/></p><p>No one knew why he was acting like this. He never normally brushed off a question like this, or us in general. Everyone on the jet seemed confused about Tony\u2019s sudden outburst, he sounded like a child begging his parents for food.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDrop us off here. There\u2019s a McDonald&rsquo;s right there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTony, what are you doing?\u201d Nat almost hissed at him.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll talk to them don\u2019t worry.\u201d He had mumbled that last part, but we heard it.</p><p>Hesitantly, the jet was landed in an almost empty parking lot. People passing by gawked, wondering what on Earth was going on. Peter and I held back as Tony casually walked off the jet, now out of his suit. Peter had quickly got out of his, as had I, though it was a struggle to keep up with Tony who could easily walk out of his. Stumbling after him, the jet lifted, the wind blowing against us as we walked on. I wasn\u2019t sure what to think of this. Was Tony taking the piss? Was this somehow a way of treating us like children? When we entered the McDonald\u2019s, all eyes had been on Iron Man as we trailed behind. He ordered us to sit down, going up to the counter by himself. It wasn\u2019t busy in there, making it all the more obvious who was continually watching us.</p><p>Tony briskly walked over with a tray, sitting across from Peter and I. He handed out the food, my annoyance growing with every second. I couldn\u2019t hold it in any longer.</p><p>\u201cTony, why are-\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cOK, so I know that this is totally random, but they\u2019ve come out with this new line of ramen noodles, and I had to try. Oh, I got cheeseburgers too, in case you didn\u2019t like them or just want it.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cMr Stark, could you please tell us why we\u2019re here?\u201d Peter was calmer than I.<br/></p><p>\u201cI only came here because I really wanted to try to food. But I wanted to talk to you guys without anyone else around.\u201d<br/></p><p>We waited for him to continue. He dug into his food, obviously enjoying it. I decided to do the same. Might as well whilst we were here. Peter followed suit, almost rushing to catch up with us.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t tell you guys, because I want you to take this slow.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cIs that just a made up excuse?\u201d I didn\u2019t want to sound mean, and I could feel Peter tense up beside me.<br/></p><p>\u201cNo. I remember when I first became Iron Man, I was thrown in the deep end. Most of us were. Cap had no experience in battle, yet after his experiment he was expected to go head first into fighting, Bruce had an accident and couldn\u2019t control his new powers, Thor had to realise his true power, and Nat and Clint&hellip;.well, you know what they\u2019ve been through by just training. What I\u2019m trying to say is that I want to teach you as best I can. Make you see the big picture of what you\u2019re getting yourself into.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell us this before? We would have understood.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cI wanted you to learn for yourselves. You two are amazingly smart kids, I couldn\u2019t be happier with your progress. And I\u2019m also glad you two have the powers you have, it\u2019s been given to the right people.\u201d</p><p>Peter and I looked at each other, bashful at Tony\u2019s comment.</p><p>He carried on.\u201cBy not tell you about what we were looking for, I knew you could concentrate on protecting the perimeter. If you knew about everything else, perhaps you wouldn\u2019t be able to focus properly, but maybe you would have. However, I am not going to take a chance, not with you two.\u201d</p><p>I groaned.\u201cTony, I\u2019m so sorry for snapping. I just really want to prove myself to the team.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, we didn\u2019t mean to be nosy.\u201d Peter added.<br/></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve already proved yourselves. There\u2019s just a little training to be done, that\u2019s all. But you\u2019re young, younger than I\u2019d like you to be when fighting whatever threats are out there, though that just means more experience for you both.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cYou know what\u2019s best for us.\u201d Peter smiled.<br/></p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I felt happier,\u201cdo what you think is right for us. Gotta learn from the master, right?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t call myself that.\u201d Tony leaned back, taking another mouthful of noodles.\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d<br/></p><p>I picked up the box, staring at the food inside.\u201cI still prefer cheeseburgers.\u201d</p>",

With Tony as a mentor, I felt like he was the father figure I never had, I was more control of my powers than ever before, even if I had more to learn.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>I slowly curled my hands into tight fists in front of me, focusing on the huge guns in the soldiers arms. They started to fold in half, my fists shaking as I put all my concentration into breaking the weapons. The soldiers were stunned, throwing their guns to the floor in panic. I used to hate freaking people out with my powers, but now I had turned it around and used it to my advantage. Before they could get away, I threw them into the air, Peter was swinging by, shooting them against the trees, making them stick there. I followed after him, this side of the perimeter now clear.</p><p>\u201cSteve, we\u2019re done here, we\u2019re coming to you.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cAlright, good job. You guys keep the outside safe whilst we head inside. Wanda and Bucky will stay out here too.\u201d He replied.<br></p><p>We confirmed his orders, the four of us spreading out around the area. It was quiet, the only noise being made was the wind gently rustling the trees. I wasn\u2019t sure whether to be very alert or to relax slightly, get my breath back. But you never knew what the enemy could be planning.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not here.\u201d Steve suddenly said through the coms.<br></p><p>\u201cWhat? What\u2019s not here?\u201d I asked, confused as to what they were looking for. Weren\u2019t we just destroying the base?<br></p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s move out, no one is in here.\u201d Tony added.<br></p><p>\u201cWait, what were we looking for?\u201d Peter also asked. What weren\u2019t we informed of.<br></p><p>\u201cCome on you two,\u201d Wanda called to us,\u201cyou heard the boss.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cIs no one gonna tell us what we were actually here for?\u201d<br></p><p>Peter and I got no response from anyone as we made our way back to the jet. We were confused. Why had we been left out of the mix? Did they have other meetings about this mission without us? I thought we were really getting somewhere with the team. As we flew back to the base, Peter and I whispered to each other, debating on what to say to the team. Should we even speak up? Would we risk everything by voicing our opinions?</p><p>\u201cUh, excuse me, everybody.\u201d Peter only just got their attention.<br></p><p>They all looked at us as we stood up, we glanced at each other, wondering what to say next.\u201cWe just wanted to ask you all something.\u201d</p><p>They waited.</p><p>\u201cWe were wondering why we weren\u2019t told about this thing we were supposed to be searching for?\u201d I nervously spat out.<br></p><p>The rest of the team shared looks, some confused, some with sympathy, though they all avoided our eye contact. Of course they knew something we didn\u2019t, but if we were going to be a team, shouldn\u2019t we have been briefed on everything? I realised we were new, but could withholding this information just cause a mess? Make something go wrong on the mission?<br></p><p>\u201cUh, well-\u201d Natasha started, being the only one to man up and say something.<br></p><p>\u201cHey, anyone hungry? I am.\u201d Tony randomly pointed out.<br></p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I scoffed. Why wasn\u2019t he taking us seriously?<br></p><p>\u201cI wanna take you kids for some food. You\u2019ve gotta be hungry right?\u201d<br></p><p>No one knew why he was acting like this. He never normally brushed off a question like this, or us in general. Everyone on the jet seemed confused about Tony\u2019s sudden outburst, he sounded like a child begging his parents for food.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDrop us off here. There\u2019s a McDonald\u2019s right there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTony, what are you doing?\u201d Nat almost hissed at him.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll talk to them don\u2019t worry.\u201d He had mumbled that last part, but we heard it.</p><p>Hesitantly, the jet was landed in an almost empty parking lot. People passing by gawked, wondering what on Earth was going on. Peter and I held back as Tony casually walked off the jet, now out of his suit. Peter had quickly got out of his, as had I, though it was a struggle to keep up with Tony who could easily walk out of his. Stumbling after him, the jet lifted, the wind blowing against us as we walked on. I wasn\u2019t sure what to think of this. Was Tony taking the piss? Was this somehow a way of treating us like children? When we entered the McDonald\u2019s, all eyes had been on Iron Man as we trailed behind. He ordered us to sit down, going up to the counter by himself. It wasn\u2019t busy in there, making it all the more obvious who was continually watching us.</p><p>Tony briskly walked over with a tray, sitting across from Peter and I. He handed out the food, my annoyance growing with every second. I couldn\u2019t hold it in any longer.</p><p>\u201cTony, why are-\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cOK, so I know that this is totally random, but they\u2019ve come out with this new line of ramen noodles, and I had to try. Oh, I got cheeseburgers too, in case you didn\u2019t like them or just want it.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cMr Stark, could you please tell us why we\u2019re here?\u201d Peter was calmer than I.<br></p><p>\u201cI only came here because I really wanted to try to food. But I wanted to talk to you guys without anyone else around.\u201d<br></p><p>We waited for him to continue. He dug into his food, obviously enjoying it. I decided to do the same. Might as well whilst we were here. Peter followed suit, almost rushing to catch up with us.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t tell you guys, because I want you to take this slow.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cIs that just a made up excuse?\u201d I didn\u2019t want to sound mean, and I could feel Peter tense up beside me.<br></p><p>\u201cNo. I remember when I first became Iron Man, I was thrown in the deep end. Most of us were. Cap had no experience in battle, yet after his experiment he was expected to go head first into fighting, Bruce had an accident and couldn\u2019t control his new powers, Thor had to realise his true power, and Nat and Clint\u2026.well, you know what they\u2019ve been through by just training. What I\u2019m trying to say is that I want to teach you as best I can. Make you see the big picture of what you\u2019re getting yourself into.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell us this before? We would have understood.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI wanted you to learn for yourselves. You two are amazingly smart kids, I couldn\u2019t be happier with your progress. And I\u2019m also glad you two have the powers you have, it\u2019s been given to the right people.\u201d</p><p>Peter and I looked at each other, bashful at Tony\u2019s comment.</p><p>He carried on.\u201cBy not tell you about what we were looking for, I knew you could concentrate on protecting the perimeter. If you knew about everything else, perhaps you wouldn\u2019t be able to focus properly, but maybe you would have. However, I am not going to take a chance, not with you two.\u201d</p><p>I groaned.\u201cTony, I\u2019m so sorry for snapping. I just really want to prove myself to the team.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, we didn\u2019t mean to be nosy.\u201d Peter added.<br></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve already proved yourselves. There\u2019s just a little training to be done, that\u2019s all. But you\u2019re young, younger than I\u2019d like you to be when fighting whatever threats are out there, though that just means more experience for you both.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYou know what\u2019s best for us.\u201d Peter smiled.<br></p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I felt happier,\u201cdo what you think is right for us. Gotta learn from the master, right?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t call myself that.\u201d Tony leaned back, taking another mouthful of noodles.\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d<br></p><p>I picked up the box, staring at the food inside.\u201cI still prefer cheeseburgers.\u201d</p></p>",
