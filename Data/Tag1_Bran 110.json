        "body": "<p>Creative juices are still flowing and I\u2019m determined to finish before season 8 starts&hellip; My long slow-burn fic. Bran makes battle plans. I guess people won\u2019t be happy about his plans&hellip;. Also on <a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/8470255/chapters/42635774\">AO3</a>.</p><p>Sansa\nwondered if the war council was too big. Too many different voices could lead\nto lengthy discussions, discussions they had no time for. She had ordered hot tea\nto be prepared for Bran who was still pale as a sheet, although the sharing of\nvisions with Daenerys had been hours ago. Worry for Bran who shared so little\nof his worries gnawed at her heart.</p><!-- more --><p>Sansa surpressed\nthe anger at Daenerys that filled her. Bran had offered her visions and she had\ntaken them but had refused to learn what Bran cared about. Anger would not lead\nher anywhere though. </p><p>She had\narranged several tables in a circle, so that there would be no question of who\nled this council. She could not afford to get into a fight about status with\nDaenerys and she could not afford to bend too much to Jon\u2019s aunt. She felt like\nshe was trying to walk on a frozen lake with thin ice. Walk too slow and she\nwould break in, walk too fast and she would slip. She was glad, Ghost was at\nher feet. She did feel safer with the wolf at her side. Ghost pressed to her\nside, his warmth a constant reminder that he would protect her, that Jon would\nprotect her. Surely Ghost would know, if Jon was in danger. Sansa was tempted\nto touch her belly, but instead she pressed her thumb on the fabric of her\nsleeves, the place where she had stitched small snowflakes into the seam. It\ncalmed her. <i>I survived Littlefinger, I am\ngoing to survive Daenerys. </i>The lords came one after the other and the hall\nfilled.</p><p>Daenerys joined\nthem after she had briefly conferred with her Hand, and the tables in a circle worked\nas Sansa had intended. The dragon queen did not fight about the seating. Her\nface held a small smile that made Sansa uncomfortable and it frightened her far\nmore than the viscious remarks Daenerys had pointed at her yesterday. Tyrion looked\nhung over, but as soon as he had taken a seat he reached for his goblet. Arya\npointedly rose, when Daenerys had taken a seat and sat as far away from\nDaenerys as possible. She dragged Gendry with her. </p><p>Daenerys raised\nan eyebrow at Arya, smiling sweetly. </p><p>\u201cWho is\nthis young man?\u201d, she asked. \u201cSurely only Lords are allowed to sit in council?\u201d</p><p>Sansa shot\nArya a warning look, and thankfully Arya did not answer, although she blushed\nheavily, if in anger or embarrassment, Sansa could not have said. </p><p>\u201cGendry knows\nall about Valyrian steel,\u201d she claimed quickly. \u201cHis experience is sorely\nneeded.\u201d <i>He is a blacksmith. He must at\nleast know some things about Valyrian steel.</i> She wished Arya would have had\nthe sense not to bring him, where Daenerys could see him. To Sansa the\nsimilarity was obvious, and she had noticed that Jaime had narrowed his eyes at\nGendry, but not many people knew that Gendry was the late King Robert\u2019s son. <i>I must remember to tell everyone who knows\nto keep silent about this.</i></p><p>Bran held\nhis cup in both hands. Even covered in fur, he looked as if he was cold. And\ntired. </p><p>\u201cJon will\narrive soon, but we best start. He knows much of what I\u2019m going to say.\u201d His\nvoice sounded flat.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you\nopen the council?\u201d, Daenerys asked. </p><p>Sansa was\nabout to choose the right words to reprimand her, but Bran was faster.</p><p>\u201cIf anyone\nis here who knows more about magic than I do, I\u2019d gladly resign.\u201d</p><p>Daenerys\neyes glittered, but she held her mouth.</p><p>\u201cMake no\nmistake, the White Walkers come, and this will be our last stand. Here at\nWinterfell the fate of the world is decided.\u201d </p><p>Bran drew a\ndeep breath. \u201cI must start with what we know about our enemy. Many of you are\nfamiliar with the tales of the Long Night, but not all, and the old tales might\ngive us a clue.\u201d</p><p>Sansa felt fatigue\novercome her, when Bran told them the stories she had known since childhood.\nOld Nan had made the stories much more interesting. To hear them in Bran\u2019s\nalmost emotionless voice robbed them of their colour and vividness. Still, it\nwould not be good to fall asleep. That would really be inappropriate. She\nwondered if she should ask Maester Wolkan for something against her tiredness. It\nprobably had to do with the pregnancy.</p><p>Bran had\njust finished the story of how the children of the forest had helped the last\nhero, when Brienne entered with Jon. Sansa was wide awake in a second and stood\nimmediately. Jon closed in in quick strides and took her in his arms. Her heart\nhammered. <i>He will be so happy about the\nbaby.</i></p><p><i>We\u2019re about to be besieged and I\u2019m just happy,\nhe is here.

Just listen, questions\ncan be asked later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe\nChildren wanted to drive off the First Men who had come with their axes and had\ncut into the forests to build their houses. They made the White Walkers as a\nweapon against the humans, but to do that, they had given them life or some\nsort of life, by misusing their water magic. The White Walkers are ice, born of\nice magic, an abomination.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey do\nnot have life of their own, they syphon their life away from the children. That\nis why the children at last were so desperate that they helped us humans to\ndefeat the White Walkers. They made a pact with us humans, here at the very weirwood\nof Winterfell, where Winter fell after the Long Night.

Bran\npulled one of the scale pans, and the other went up.</p><p>\u201cThis caused\nthe creation of fire magic, or probably more accurately the increase of fire\nmagic. The existence of the White Walkers made it possible that the Valyrians\nused fire magic.\u201d </p><p>Bran let\nthe scales swing, and they swung wildly. </p><p>\u201cThe scales\ncame to rest once more, when Valyria fell, but about fourty to fifty years ago,\nthe scales were tipped again. I\u2019ve talked with Tormund,\u2026\u201d Bran nodded briefly at\nthe wildling who sat at the table. \u201c\u2026. and he agrees that the White Walkers\ncame back around that time. Their strength has gained momentum ever since.\u201d</p><p>He tipped\nat the scales again. Sansa shuddered. She wondered what had instigated the\nWhite Walkers awakening. She looked at her brother who responded with an\nintense gaze, that seemed to say \u2018Don\u2019t ask\u2019. </p><p><i>Fifty years. That must have been the reign of\nAegon the Unlikely. Summerhall? Aegon wanted to wake dragons? And he woke ice\ninstead?</i> Sansa was\npuzzled. <i>Why does Bran keep silent about\nthis?</i> A fist of fear clutched her heart. Her eyes met Arya\u2019s, and on her\nface she saw the same puzzlement. </p><p>\u201cWhat does\nthat mean for us?\u201d Jon asked. </p><p>\u201cIt means\nthat the children want us to reduce the might of the White Walkers, so that\ntheir life force flows back into the river of life that sustains them. Our\nrecent victory has given them back more power, I can feel what they want, when\nI touch the weirwood. They want us to use fire and dragons to defeat them and\nbring the children back and enter a new pact with them.\u201d</p><p><b><i>They</i></b><i> want us\u2026. What do you want Bran?</i></p><p>Bran took\nhis time and looked them all in the eyes. \u201cIt means we have to fight the White\nWalkers and to defeat them, we have to use the dragons and the wildfire and\neverything we have. I will have to call the Kings of Winter again. Then the children\nwill come back. It means, we have to lure the White Walkers into a fiery trap,\nright here where the last hero took his stand the last time. It means, we have\nto give up Winterfell.\u201d</p>",

I guess people won&rsquo;t be happy about his plans&hellip;. Also on <a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/8470255/chapters/42635774\">AO3</a>.</p><p>Sansa\nwondered if the war council was too big. Too many different voices could lead\nto lengthy discussions, discussions they had no time for. She had ordered hot tea\nto be prepared for Bran who was still pale as a sheet, although the sharing of\nvisions with Daenerys had been hours ago. Worry for Bran who shared so little\nof his worries gnawed at her heart.</p><p>Sansa surpressed\nthe anger at Daenerys that filled her. Bran had offered her visions and she had\ntaken them but had refused to learn what Bran cared about. Anger would not lead\nher anywhere though. </p><p>She had\narranged several tables in a circle, so that there would be no question of who\nled this council. She could not afford to get into a fight about status with\nDaenerys and she could not afford to bend too much to Jon&rsquo;s aunt. She felt like\nshe was trying to walk on a frozen lake with thin ice. Walk too slow and she\nwould break in, walk too fast and she would slip. She was glad, Ghost was at\nher feet. She did feel safer with the wolf at her side. Ghost pressed to her\nside, his warmth a constant reminder that he would protect her, that Jon would\nprotect her. Surely Ghost would know, if Jon was in danger. Sansa was tempted\nto touch her belly, but instead she pressed her thumb on the fabric of her\nsleeves, the place where she had stitched small snowflakes into the seam. It\ncalmed her. <i>I survived Littlefinger, I am\ngoing to survive Daenerys. </i>The lords came one after the other and the hall\nfilled.</p><p>Daenerys joined\nthem after she had briefly conferred with her Hand, and the tables in a circle worked\nas Sansa had intended. The dragon queen did not fight about the seating. Her\nface held a small smile that made Sansa uncomfortable and it frightened her far\nmore than the viscious remarks Daenerys had pointed at her yesterday. Tyrion looked\nhung over, but as soon as he had taken a seat he reached for his goblet. Arya\npointedly rose, when Daenerys had taken a seat and sat as far away from\nDaenerys as possible. She dragged Gendry with her. </p><p>Daenerys raised\nan eyebrow at Arya, smiling sweetly. </p><p>&ldquo;Who is\nthis young man?&rdquo;, she asked. &ldquo;Surely only Lords are allowed to sit in council?&rdquo;</p><p>Sansa shot\nArya a warning look, and thankfully Arya did not answer, although she blushed\nheavily, if in anger or embarrassment, Sansa could not have said. </p><p>&ldquo;Gendry knows\nall about Valyrian steel,&rdquo; she claimed quickly. &ldquo;His experience is sorely\nneeded.&rdquo; <i>He is a blacksmith. He must at\nleast know some things about Valyrian steel.</i> She wished Arya would have had\nthe sense not to bring him, where Daenerys could see him. To Sansa the\nsimilarity was obvious, and she had noticed that Jaime had narrowed his eyes at\nGendry, but not many people knew that Gendry was the late King Robert&rsquo;s son. <i>I must remember to tell everyone who knows\nto keep silent about this.</i></p><p>Bran held\nhis cup in both hands. Even covered in fur, he looked as if he was cold. And\ntired. </p><p>&ldquo;Jon will\narrive soon, but we best start. He knows much of what I&rsquo;m going to say.&rdquo; His\nvoice sounded flat.</p><p>&ldquo;Why do you\nopen the council?&rdquo;, Daenerys asked. </p><p>Sansa was\nabout to choose the right words to reprimand her, but Bran was faster.</p><p>&ldquo;If anyone\nis here who knows more about magic than I do, I&rsquo;d gladly resign.&rdquo;</p><p>Daenerys\neyes glittered, but she held her mouth.</p><p>&ldquo;Make no\nmistake, the White Walkers come, and this will be our last stand. Here at\nWinterfell the fate of the world is decided.&rdquo; </p><p>Bran drew a\ndeep breath. &ldquo;I must start with what we know about our enemy. Many of you are\nfamiliar with the tales of the Long Night, but not all, and the old tales might\ngive us a clue.&rdquo;</p><p>Sansa felt fatigue\novercome her, when Bran told them the stories she had known since childhood.\nOld Nan had made the stories much more interesting. To hear them in Bran&rsquo;s\nalmost emotionless voice robbed them of their colour and vividness. Still, it\nwould not be good to fall asleep. That would really be inappropriate. She\nwondered if she should ask Maester Wolkan for something against her tiredness. It\nprobably had to do with the pregnancy.</p><p>Bran had\njust finished the story of how the children of the forest had helped the last\nhero, when Brienne entered with Jon. Sansa was wide awake in a second and stood\nimmediately. Jon closed in in quick strides and took her in his arms. Her heart\nhammered. <i>He will be so happy about the\nbaby.</i></p><p><i>We&rsquo;re about to be besieged and I&rsquo;m just happy,\nhe is here. We&rsquo;re on the eve of destruction, but my heart is full of joy. </i>She separated herself from his arms.\nIt would not do to show too much affection. She hoped that Daenerys had not\nseen more, than a dutiful husband greeting his wife. She could feel the blood\nrush to her face, when she saw Jon&rsquo;s eyes glitter and his smile that warmed her\nheart. </p><p>The other\nlords had rosen as well, Jaime Lannister had been the first. Sansa saw that he\nhad managed to block Daenerys&rsquo; from seeing them. <i>Gods bless him.</i></p><p>Jon nodded\nfriendly to the Lords, and made a small gesture with his hand, and they sat\nagain. He spotted Daenerys, who had remained seated.</p><p>He gave the\nslightest indication of a bow.</p><p>&ldquo;Aunt,&rdquo; he\nsaid. &ldquo;I am glad you came to join the fight for the living.&rdquo; <i>I doubt she came for that, but it such a\nnice way to put that.</i></p><p>Daenerys\nstudied him for a long uncomfortable moment.</p><p>&ldquo;I know my\nduty to my people&rdquo;, she answered.</p><p>Jon took a\nseat beside Sansa.

        "body": "<h1>GOT Trailer - What Didn\u2019t We See?</h1><p>By now, everyone has gone over every millisecond of the new S8 Game of Thrones trailer with a fine tooth comb (if you\u2019re looking for a quality analysis, both <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfOiG9or7QPmdyNhTSD9Ftw\">@fortunatelylori</a> and <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m61FcucyaOKFkj0gFLKRgJA\">@thelawyerthatwaspromised</a> have great break downs of the trailer). So I won\u2019t add my voice to the mix in regards to what was included in the trailer, but I did want to discuss what wasn\u2019t included. </p><p>As expected, the trailer was tightly edited. We were given very little that wasn\u2019t set up the previous season and as many have already discussed, the trailer seems to focus on the first three episodes and the battle with the White Walkers. I know some people dismiss the importance of GOT trailers, but on the whole, they do tend to tell a cohesive story in relation to each season\u2019s narrative arc. Therefore, you can tell just as much by what is omitted from the trailer as to what is included, especially when the expected is missing.</p><p>So what was missing from the trailer that the audience expected to see, especially in light of S7?</p><h2><i>1. <b>Daenerys and her dragons missing from the White Walker battle.</b></i></h2><p>At the end of S7, Daenerys, her dragons and her army were heading North to \u201csave\u201d it from the approaching Army of the Dead. Jon (and the majority of the GA) is convinced that the dragons are key to defeating the Night King (while the dragons have the potential to be effective in thinning out the wights, the White Walkers are immune to fire). So like <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/myHfbeJjjc8bFgVOAD6sAmg\">@jonsalways</a> asked, where is Daenerys? I expected a token shot of her riding Drogon, a dragon breathing fire and destroying wights - something that demonstrated her self-appointed role as saviour of the North.
